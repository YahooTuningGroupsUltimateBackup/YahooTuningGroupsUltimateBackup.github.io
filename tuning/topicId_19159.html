The<br/>&gt; standard, or<br/>&gt; _quarter-comma MT_, distributes the comma among four fifths, so that their<br/>&gt; octave-reduced sum is a just major third (5:4, 386.3 cents).  The fifth in<br/>&gt; quarter-comma MT has a size of 696.6 cents. This can be tuned by ear by first<br/>&gt; setting a just major third and then tempering the intermediate fifths.</p><p>In practice it works better to start with the fifths and use the thirds<br/>to check (Michael Praetorius 2. Art on p. 154 of &quot;Syntagma musicum&quot; Vol.<br/>II De Organographia). To set a good meantone temperament is *not easy<br/>and .</p><p>&gt; The major variants of MT include:</p><p>&gt; Third-comma MT</p><p>&gt; Fifth-comma, where an octave-reduced just major seventh (15:8, 1088.3<br/>&gt; cents) is<br/>&gt; the sum of five fifths of 697.6 cents),</p><p>and the beat rates of the major third and the fifths are virtually the<br/>same, making this type of temperament very &quot;harmonious&quot; - works<br/>especially well on organs.</p><p>&gt; Sixth-comma, where an octave-reduced just augmented fourth (45:32, 590.2 cents)<br/>&gt; is the sum of six fifths of 698.4 cents). After quarter-comma MT,<br/>&gt; sixth-tone temperament was the most widely used, especially in organs of<br/>&gt; the late baroque and classical eras.</p><p>I wonder a bit whether this can be established from analysis of existing instruments</p><p>&gt; with each additional tone adding an additional available tonality. MT<br/>&gt; instruments with more than 12 keys per octave were not unknown,</p><p>Not unknown? Rather frequent, in certain places, at certain times.<br/>I think it was rather frequent at places with a professional music in<br/>Italy (mid-15th century to mid 17th century) and spreading to German<br/>speaking or German influenced countries where we know of orgas with up<br/>to 16 keys per octave in the time from 1612 to 1721.<br/>From a literature survey I count now more than 70 organs from small<br/>positives to 3-manual instruments which have had subsemitones.</p><p>An overview [in Dutch] and the most recent list (understandable to<br/>anyone, even if not reading Dutch) can be found here</p><p>Ibo Ortgies: &quot;Subsemitoetsen bij historische orgels tussen 1468 en 1721<br/>[Split keys on historical organs between 1468 and 1721].&quot;<br/>Het Orgel [Netherlands] 96, no. 6 (2000): 20-26.

Some people have suggested that singers would have<br/>narrowed the leading tones, so let&apos;s consider that hypothesis.</p><p>&gt; In &quot;meantone&quot; temperament a major semitone (the &quot;leading&quot; tone in a<br/>&gt; discant clause) would have 117 cents, the minor semitone 76 cents<br/>&gt; chromatic. Depending on the bass line (not a part, but as a &quot;basso<br/>&gt; seguente&quot;, taking always the lowest sounding note...) the leading<br/>tone<br/>&gt; might even be larger<br/>&gt; (s. even below) ...</p><p>As an example, take a G7-C cadence.  That has two semitone steps, B-C<br/>and F-E.  You can narrow either of these to a minor semitone by<br/>replacing B with B^(Cb) or F with Fv(E#).  The former happens to give<br/>you a 9-limit chord, the latter a 7-limit one.</p><p>But let&apos;s put 9-limit harmony aside.  In which case, a seventh chord<br/>is dissonant however you spell it.  So why is it used?  To give<br/>semitonal motion.  A note is added to the G major chord to give it a<br/>semitone from a note in the C major chord.  If you have 12 pitch<br/>classes, it doesn&apos;t matter if that note is F or E#, but you call it F<br/>because it fits a C major key and gives a minor third B-F.</p><p>However, with 19 pitch classes, choosing either F or E# will give<br/>different chords.  Either includes (5-limit) dissonance.  One is also<br/>chromatic, but Gesualdo was no stranger to chromaticism.</p><p>To reinforce this point: with 19 pitch classes the choice between F<br/>and E# is between different chords, not the best tuning of a<br/>particular chord.</p><p>If Gesualdo were using 19 pitch classes, and expected his singers to<br/>narrow leading tones, I would expect him to use dissonances in the<br/>manner outlined above to give motion by minor semitones.  I don&apos;t know<br/>of a single example of him doing this.  So either leading tones were<br/>not in fashion, he was cloth-eared, or he was using 12 pitch classes<br/>and tuning/spelling for 5-limit intervals.  He did use dissonance, and<br/>a lot of chromaticism, so what I&apos;ve seen so far strongly suggests 12<br/>pitch classes.</p><p>Of course, it may be he was pushing the envelope, and deliberately<br/>writing innocent looking progressions that would expose chromatic<br/>semitones, or even the occasional diesis.  That kind of thing&apos;s harder<br/>to prove.</p><p>The upshot of all this is that the use of meantone by Gesualdo (and,<br/>it appears, his contemporaries) isn&apos;t that interesting.  They were<br/>using 5-limit thirds.  Big deal.  They didn&apos;t seem to be using any<br/>scalar concepts not present in later music, provided it observes<br/>correct spelling.  They were using a few keyboards with more than 12<br/>notes to the octave, but only to allow greater range of modulation.<br/>They weren&apos;t exploiting the new sonorities those split keys gave them.<br/> They don&apos;t stand as models for the modern Xenharmonicist in the way<br/>that Vicentino does.</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;m arguing.  It&apos;s entirely consistent with received<br/>opinion, but I had to go to the scores to convince myself of it.</p><p>                Graham</p><p>P.S. the first reference I know of to the idea of mis-spelling<br/>meantone to give chromatic semitones is in an essay by Ivor Darreg.  I<br/>can check the source if anybody likes, and may do so anyway.  I don&apos;t<br/>think he mentions the relationship to 9-limit harmony.  --GB</p></div><h3>Paul H.

And as they know more<br/>  about mathematics than of musical history they laid down laws<br/>  which, in actual fact, no human being had ever obeyed.&quot;</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t agree wholly with his statement, but I believe the root of<br/>the matter is that we should regard history and the math, both necessary<br/>to understand phenomena better.</p><p>&gt;  Some people have suggested that singers would have<br/>&gt; narrowed the leading tones, so let&apos;s consider that hypothesis.</p><p>narrowed, it can be by raising the &quot;leading note&quot; or as could be also<br/>reaching the resolved note at a lower pitch, which happens in practic</p><p>&gt; &gt; In &quot;meantone&quot; temperament a major semitone (the &quot;leading&quot; tone in a<br/>&gt; &gt; discant clause) would have 117 cents, the minor semitone 76 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; chromatic.

That has two semitone steps, B-C<br/>&gt; and F-E.  You can narrow either of these to a minor semitone by<br/>&gt; replacing B with B^(Cb) or F with Fv(E#).  The former happens to give<br/>&gt; you a 9-limit chord, the latter a 7-limit one.</p><p>&gt; But let&apos;s put 9-limit harmony aside.  In which case, a seventh chord<br/>&gt; is dissonant however you spell it.  So why is it used?  To give<br/>&gt; semitonal motion.  A note is added to the G major chord to give it a<br/>&gt; semitone from a note in the C major chord.</p><p>In the music of the vocal polyphony &quot;meantone era&quot; it was not added -<br/>treatment of dissonances was a part of counterpoint/voice leading. An<br/>&quot;f&quot; above &quot;g&quot; in a piece of Gesualdo could only be a (meantone) f. The<br/>sequence g-e#-e (replacing g-f-d) would not occur. And: we talking about<br/>vocal compositions, which probably were rehearsed and accompanied with<br/>19- or 31 note keyboards.</p><p>&gt; If you have 12 pitch<br/>&gt; classes, it doesn&apos;t matter if that note is F or E#, but you call it F<br/>&gt; because it fits a C major key and gives a minor third B-F.</p><p>minor third: D-F (?)</p><p>...<br/>&gt; If Gesualdo were using 19 pitch classes, and expected his singers to<br/>&gt; narrow leading tones,</p><p>... we cannot assume that they narrowed leading tones since a discant<br/>clause, where tyhe leading note would occur, would be the large semitone<br/>(16:15) resp. it&apos;s meantone approximation.</p><p>&gt; I would expect him to use dissonances in the<br/>&gt; manner outlined above to give motion by minor semitones.  I don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; of a single example of him doing this.</p><p>Then, why would you expect it?</p><p>&gt; So either leading tones were<br/>&gt; not in fashion, he was cloth-eared, or he was using 12 pitch classes<br/>&gt; and tuning/spelling for 5-limit intervals.</p><p>Nothing of this I regard as right<br/>- leading tones (as large semitones) occurred in evrey discant clause<br/>- that Gesualdo might have been cloth-eared,<br/>- 12 pitches* per octave, or more per piece up to 19 (talking abstractly<br/>  here, as if talking about keyboards - in vocal intonation there would<br/>  be ideally more pitches, mainly the pure fifths)<br/>- he would have used the terminology of his time, one aspect of which<br/>  might be describable with the modern X-limit-concept.</p><p>* the modern concept of pitch class doesn&apos;t add anything to the argument</p><p>&gt; He did use dissonance, and a lot of chromaticism,<br/>&gt; so what I&apos;ve seen so far strongly suggests 12 pitch classes.</p><p>While the first part of the previous sentence is undoubted,<br/>the second is wrong conlusion:<br/>If a piece has no more than twelve pitches then you are right, but what<br/>if it makes use of g# and a-flat, which are in any case distinct pitches<br/>in G&apos;s time?</p><p>&gt; The upshot of all this is that the use of meantone by Gesualdo (and,<br/>&gt; it appears, his contemporaries) isn&apos;t that interesting.</p><p>Not intersting to you (what a pity)<br/>- and again, how can you judge without referring to the historical background?<br/>No one has the *full historical background of course, but we are<br/>striving, hopefully.</p><p>&gt; ...

These had 14 keys<br/>to the<br/>  octave, with separate keys for d#/eb and g#/ab.</p><p>  In 1768 an organ was built for the Foundling Hospital, London by Thomas<br/>  Parker. This instrument replaced an unsucessful organ built in 1750 by<br/>  Justinian Morse and paid for by Handel.<br/>  Parker&apos;s organ had levers at the console, two for each of the three<br/>  manuals. One gave c# and eb at rest, c# and d# when moved to the left,<br/>  and db and eb when moved to the right. The other gave g# and bb at<br/>  rest, ab and bb when moved to the left, and g# and a# when moved to<br/>  the right.</p><p>  It is often assumed that this was a &apos;Handel&apos; organ, but of course Handel<br/>  died in 1759, before the Parker organ was built.  It is not known whether<br/>  the Morse organ also had &apos;extra&apos; notes. However, it is said that Handel<br/>  often went to hear John Stanley play at the Temple Church.  I cannot give<br/>  you a source for this information but I imagine it probably comes from<br/>  Hawkins or Burney.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 21 Feb 2001 16:44:39 -0500<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Paul H.

It spread<br/>probably first to related areas, f. ex. Spain (only a few instruments<br/>known right now),<br/>beginning of the 17th century Germany, which was totally dominated by<br/>Italian musical culture then became the northern turntable (in Italy the<br/>last instrument known to me now, was built in the late 1660ies). German<br/>organ builders working took the idea to the Netherlands, Denmark,<br/>Switzerland, Sweden, and Britain. Only in Sweden, heavily German<br/>influenced, domestic/native swedish organ builders are known to have<br/>taken over the practice.</p><p>All this depends of course from the amount of evidence and it&apos;s evaluation.</p><p>&gt;  In Italy,<br/>&gt; England, &amp; France it may indeed have been common *for organs* until the late 18th C.,</p><p>In Britain and some parts of the USA (New England) it seems to have been frequent.<br/>Again quotin Lloyd (p.66):<br/>&quot;The tuning of organs in mean-tone temperament was the rule in the first<br/>half of the 19th century.&quot;</p><p>In Britain pianos seem to have been *often tuned in meantone tuning<br/>(quarter comma) until ca. 1850, as well.</p><p>Until the end of the century this was a controversial matter among<br/>musicians, instrument builders, musicologists.</p><p>References:<br/>Lloyd<br/> and<br/>Owen, Barbara.

MT<br/>&gt; has been widely revived for performances of early music; modern<br/>&gt; tracker organs<br/>&gt; in MT are not uncommon.</p><p>&gt; ###I wish it were so!  By far the most non-ET modern organs are tuned in something between MT &amp;<br/>&gt; 12-tet.  Even historical organs when &apos;historically&apos; restored are far too often tuned to a<br/>&gt; temperament which makes possible performance of Bach&apos;s organ works, whether this repertoire is<br/>&gt; relevant to the style of the instrument or not.###</p><p>sigh! - yes.  I know of one organ where the original temperament (1797)<br/>could be detected having 1/3-comma and 1/6-comma tempered fifths.  This<br/>was &quot;equalized&quot; in the restoration to a more regular 1/6-comma modified<br/>meantone. I think they should first try out the original temperament.<br/>When it is completely unuseful, from the point of the improvisational<br/>practice of the time of its origin and of repertoire which might have<br/>been available at that place, then it might be considered to be possible<br/>to modify it slightly. And when arriving at that conclusion, hesitate<br/>ten times before doing that to an original instrument.

I<br/>regard this aspect of continuo playing as primary, the rhythmic aspect<br/>and keeping the ensemble &quot;together&quot; seems secondary. Since the bass<br/>instruments have to provide the correct tone to intonate above and since<br/>they have to obey the temperament.</p><p>&gt;   The musical sense does not have the grasp you attribute<br/>&gt; to it.  The ease of providing pure harmonies independent of meantone theory<br/>&gt; makes much more musical and practical sense to me for Gesualdo than any<br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt; put forward.  Clearly we each have areas of expertise that are greater than<br/>&gt; others and this may be a blind spot for either of us.</p><p>&gt; &gt;However, for Gesualdo, his music would have to be in<br/>&gt; &gt;something fairly obvious, or he would have need to leave special<br/>&gt; instructions<br/>&gt; &gt;for doing his music, if you get my drift.</p><p>&gt; My drift is that a rough blurring of meantone was the only obvious tuning in<br/>&gt; his time and place, and unless we find any &quot;special instructions&quot;, it&apos;s our<br/>&gt; best guess.</p><p>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 25<br/>&gt;    Date: Thu, 22 Feb 2001 10:18:05 +0100<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:djwolf1@matavnet.hu">djwolf1@matavnet.hu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Meantone FAQ</p><p>&gt; Some responses:</p><p>&gt; (1) I stand by &quot;modern tracker organs in MT are not uncommon&quot;.

I never expected anybody to agree with that one.</p><p>&gt; - 12 pitches* per octave, or more per piece up to 19 (talking abstractly<br/>&gt;   here, as if talking about keyboards - in vocal intonation there would<br/>&gt;   be ideally more pitches, mainly the pure fifths)</p><p>Not sure what you mean by this.  I&apos;m not sure he ever used more than 12 pitches (as<br/>written) in a piece although he may have used as many as 20.  I haven&apos;t counted.<br/>But what&apos;s its relevance?</p><p>&gt; - he would have used the terminology of his time, one aspect of which<br/>&gt;   might be describable with the modern X-limit-concept.</p><p>That looks obviously true to me.  So is it still what you don&apos;t regard as right?</p><p>&gt; * the modern concept of pitch class doesn&apos;t add anything to the argument</p><p>You obviously have a low opinion of my argument, because it would fall to the<br/>ground immediately without the idea of pitch classes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; He did use dissonance, and a lot of chromaticism,<br/>&gt; &gt; so what I&apos;ve seen so far strongly suggests 12 pitch classes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the first part of the previous sentence is undoubted,<br/>&gt; the second is wrong conlusion:<br/>&gt; If a piece has no more than twelve pitches then you are right, but what<br/>&gt; if it makes use of g# and a-flat, which are in any case distinct pitches<br/>&gt; in G&apos;s time?</p><p>Same pitch class.  Saying something adds nothing to the argument, and then showing<br/>the argument to be absurd without it is low rhetoric.</p><p>I&apos;ve thought about how this argument should be phrased:  Gesualdo&apos;s music only<br/>requires 12 pitch classes.</p><p>That means, if you represent the music using 12 pitch classes, it can be converted<br/>to the staff (and therefore meantone) exactly as Gesualdo did if you follow these<br/>rules, in order, 1 being the most important:</p><p>1)  Use 5-limit intervals vertically<br/>2)  No double sharps<br/>3)  Use 5-limit intervals for direct melodic steps<br/>4)  Use diatonic intervals melodically<br/>5)  Favour nominals</p><p>Everything I&apos;ve seen so far obeys these rules.  Note that this is a falsifiable<br/>hypothesis!  Find an examples that doesn&apos;t translate from 12 pitch classes to the<br/>score following these rules, an it will show that Gesualdo did use more than 12<br/>pitch classes.</p><p>In fact, I fully expect such an example to exist.  I&apos;m told he used augmented sixth<br/>chords, and they would typically break rule 1.  It may be more complex rules<br/>operate, or different rules for different pieces, or there are a few special cases.<br/> However, the majority of the music follows these rules, hence predominantly<br/>requires only 12 pitch classes.</p><p>Note that rule 2 is added since the last message.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The upshot of all this is that the use of meantone by Gesualdo (and,<br/>&gt; &gt; it appears, his contemporaries) isn&apos;t that interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not intersting to you (what a pity)</p><p>I can only speak for myself</p><p>&gt; - and again, how can you judge without referring to the historical<br/>&gt; background?</p><p>and I can be wrong.  But I don&apos;t clutter my prose with disclaimers.</p><p>In fact, the examples I&apos;ve seen more recently show that it is more interesting than<br/>I thought, although only those few examples.</p><p>&gt; No one has the *full historical background of course, but we are<br/>&gt; striving, hopefully.</p><p>I hope so.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... They were using a few keyboards with more than 12<br/>&gt; &gt; notes to the octave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Especially at the Italian centers of madrigal-composition there were<br/>&gt; many:<br/>&gt; See:</p><p>Thanks for the references.  I&apos;ll see if I can find any of them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; but only to allow greater range of modulation.<br/>&gt; &gt; They weren&apos;t exploiting the new sonorities those split keys gave them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They were exploiting them within the frame that the music theory of the<br/>&gt; time would allow - I regard that as the same degree of exploitation,<br/>&gt; like Bach exploited the sonmorities which the rising well-tempered<br/>&gt; tunings offered.</p><p>Before you quoted &quot;Music came first; then the scales ... then came the theorists to<br/>explain them.&quot;  And you half agreed with it.  Now you&apos;re saying composers are<br/>constrained by theory?  I disagree!</p><p>But anyway, it&apos;s as much the practice of the time as Gesualdo in particular that<br/>I&apos;m interested in.  Gesualdo happens to be a prominent example of a highly<br/>chromatic composer who may have encountered split-key keyboards.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s what I&apos;m arguing.  It&apos;s entirely consistent with received<br/>&gt; &gt; opinion,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sorry, I disagree completely - it&apos;s your opinion and certainly the<br/>&gt; opinion of other, also honorable people, too</p><p>What I meant was received opinion (and I didn&apos;t express myself clearly) is that<br/>meantone was used to provide 5-limit intervals, not the greater 9-limit, and not<br/>chromatic semitones unless the 5-limit spelling happens to fit that.

Seashore and Barbour maintain that scooping and pitch wandering<br/>make it impossible for singers to come reliably closer to a certain<br/>frequency than about a fifth of a semitone. See Harold Seashore, &quot;An<br/>Objective Analysis of Artistic Singing,&quot; pp. 25-77, and Barbour Tuning<br/>and Temperament, pp. 197-98. But the Hilliard Ensemble recording<br/>excerpt given below, in a sampling of major chords at eleven points<br/>throughout, gives an average major 10th (the most common voicing for<br/>the third) with a ratio of 2.507 above the root. This compares with<br/>the pure ratio of 2.500 and the ET ratio of 2.520, and represents a<br/>predilection for thirds that are twice as close to pure as they are to<br/>ET, as well as a tuning accuracy six times closer to the intended<br/>frequency than that predicted above. The excerpt also ends with a<br/>chord sustained with astonishingly pure tuning over a full eight<br/>seconds duration. It takes remarkable precision and extraordinary<br/>vocal control to maintain such a beautifully tuned chord for so long,<br/>but this recording shows that it is possible, and that our<br/>expectations for ensemble singing should be adjusted accordingly.<br/>Indeed, even Ternstr&ouml;m and Karna acknowledge that &quot;vocal groups that<br/>perform close harmony with one voice to a part ... strive to achieve<br/>harmonies that are so precisely tuned and so straight in pitch that<br/>the voices fuse together and we hear one instrumentlike chord rather<br/>than several part singers.&quot; See &quot;Choir,&quot; p. 280.&quot;</p><p>Thomas Dent reviewed that in:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/67835">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/67835</a></p><p>Unfortuantly beyond that vague speculations<br/>R.Duffin gives no data for the corresponding variation at all.<br/>That lack in data specification demands caution:<br/>Hence we should touch his claimed values only carefully with a barge-pole.</p><p>At least the numerical deviation versus 5/2 can be calculated.<br/>It amounts for:<br/>(alleged Hillyard&apos;s octaved 3rds)/(octaved JI-3rds: 5/2 := 2*(5/4))<br/>barely about:<br/>1200 * ln(2.507/2.5) / ln(2) = ~4.84...Cents (+-?.??...Cents)<br/>in difference only.<br/>An objection stays open:<br/>The experimental root mean standard-deviation remains unknown.</p><p>At least:<br/>That given ~5Cents appears significant less than the 12-EDO 3rd&apos;s<br/>1200 * ln(2.52/2.5) / ln(2) = ~13.79...Cents<br/>chargeing the 3rds 3-times worser,<br/>than in the above a-capella case.</p><p>There remains doubts in Duffin&apos;s interpretation<br/>due to systematically incomplete data,</p><p>But -all in all- we may conclude carefully:<br/>Sensitive HIP-Renaissance a-capella singers,<br/>alike the Hillyard-ensemble, can probably<br/>perfrom almost JI 3rds about ~3-times less beating than in 12-EDO,<br/>especially in long lasting major chords<br/>2:3:5<br/>Discerning aware such audiable nuances<br/>works only when singing fully free unaccompanied<br/>without any continuo instrument.</p><p>But some fomous singers do pay attention to even more aspects as<br/>for instance:<br/>Attending the composers choice of the absolute-pitch.<br/>Example:<br/>Pavarotti demanded his personal preferred absolute pitch: 438Hz<br/>May be:<br/>probably because he judged himself that at that pitch his own voice<br/>would sound the best.</p><p>Some evidence for that hypothesis delivers a quote from:<br/><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D91239F932A35752C0A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D91239F932A35752C0A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all</a><br/>&quot;Mr. Pavarotti doubts that pitch will ever return to Verdi&apos;s<br/>relatively deep standards. &apos;&apos;We must be careful to guard pitch at<br/>around 440 - maybe even 438,&apos;&apos; he said recently. &apos;&apos;That is where the<br/>juicy sound is.&apos;&apos; Juicy for him, that is to say.

I knew that he specified in his contract that the<br/>orchestra needed to tune to A 438. Before Luciano appeared at the<br/>rehearsal, I heard the oboist produce an A 440 to tune the orchestra.<br/>I didn&apos;t say anything and kept my guitar tuned to A 438.<br/>(The &quot;Perfect Pitch&quot; person usually learns to keep his mouth shut<br/>since he&apos;s in the minority)<br/>Mr. Pavarotti came out and proceeded to start the rehearsal.<br/>After a few bars, he stopped the orchestra and reprimanded the oboist<br/>for tuning the orchestra to A 440.<br/>The oboist played an A 440 and said it was A 438. Then Luciano sang a<br/>perfect A 438, and had the orchestra tune to him.&quot;</p><p>An usual cat and mouse game of strategy,<br/>that arises only<br/>when oboist &amp; soloist do both possess different APs.<br/>Such little fights happen sometimes in order to fob each others.<br/>They do continue usually only as long,<br/>until one of them has enforced his own individual preferred AP<br/>to the whole orchestre.<br/>In most cases the chief-oboist wins the palm by default<br/>against the conductor, soloists and all others, without any effort.</p><p>But in Pavarotti&apos;s particular case<br/>the oboist lost the match embarassing<br/>and had to cave downwards about 2Hz even until 438Hz.<br/>That sounds remarkable ~1/3~SC flatter than normal 440Hz:</p><p>1200 * ln(440/438) / ln(2) = ~7.89...Cents</p><p>~(81:80)^(1/3) lower than the usual standard<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440</a></p><p>Liliana Gorini&apos;s<br/>&quot;In memoria di Luciano Pavarotti&quot;<br/>picks up that matter in Itlalian language:<br/><a href="http://www.movisol.org/07news143.htm">http://www.movisol.org/07news143.htm</a><br/>&quot;...antanti lirici che sostennero la nostra iniziativa per tornare al<br/>&quot;La verdiano&quot; (La=432 Hz, l&apos;accordatura scientifica dell&apos;orchestra<br/>voluta da Giuseppe Verdi per decreto nel 1884)........<br/>Boggio e Mezzapesa, inizialmente per rispettare il volere di Giuseppe<br/>Verdi che nel decreto del 1884 parlava di La=432 Hz come &quot;accordatura<br/>scientifica&quot;, fu cambiato in La=440 Hz per compiacere i produttori di<br/>strumenti a fiato, che altrimenti non avrebbero smaltito le loro<br/>scorte, e l&apos;iniziativa non ebbe quindi alcun seguito, perch&eacute; non<br/>rispettava pi&ugrave; la volont&agrave; di Verdi...&quot;</p><p>That confirms my own observation:<br/>Only a few performers do still care still about proper<br/>absolute-pitch that Verdi once wanted for his own works.</p><p>Quest:<br/>Why insisted L.Pavarotti in his personal absolute pitch of 438cps?<br/>as documented by his own colleauges that played along with himself?<br/>For what reasons? we only can speculate.</p><p>Furthermore:<br/>Would he also had liked the following &apos;septenarian&apos; cycle of 5ths<br/>for the other 11 open remaining notes<br/>in order to complete the full dodecatonic scale:</p><p>Attempt:</p><p>A: 219 438Hz<br/>E: 164 328 658               (&lt; 659=3*A)<br/>B: 491                       (&lt; 492=3*E)<br/>F# 23 46 92 184 368 736 1472 (&lt; 1473=3*B)<br/>C# 69 = 3*F#<br/>G# (13 26 52 104 208 416&lt;)415(&lt; 414 207 = 3*C#)<br/>Eb 39 = 3*13<br/>Bb 117 = 3*39<br/>F: 175 330                   (&lt; 351 = 3*Bb)<br/>C: 131 262 524               (&lt; 525 = 3*F)<br/>G: 98 196 392                (&lt; 393 = 3*C)<br/>D: (73 146 292 &lt;)    293     (&lt; 294 = 3*98)<br/>A: 219 = 3*73</p><p>that yields in chromatically ascending order for the 12 keys:</p><p>C&apos; 262 &apos;middle_C&apos;<br/>C# 276<br/>D&apos; 293<br/>Eb 312<br/>E&apos; 328<br/>F&apos; 350<br/>F# 368<br/>G&apos; 392<br/>G# 415<br/>A&apos; 438 Hz : Pavarotti&apos;s own choice<br/>Bb 468<br/>B&apos; 491<br/>c&quot; 524 &apos;tenor_C&apos;</p><p>that dozen of integral frequencies corresponds in the:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/scl_format.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/scl_format.html</a><br/>and is equivalent the following 12 ratios:</p><p>!Pavarotti_438Hz.scl<br/>!Proposal by A.Sparschuh for easier singing together with continuo<br/>!<br/>sounds best @ Luciano Pavarotti&apos;s own demanded absolute pitch: 438Hz<br/>!<br/>12<br/>!<br/>138/131 !

At the urging of singers in certain<br/>German and London opera houses, this standard was adopted for a time<br/>in opera houses and concert halls in other parts of Europe also.<br/>(Imagine all the new wind instruments that needed to be made and<br/>bought, also the tuning forks.) A=435 Hz was a compromise  between<br/>A=450 Hz, which was too high for singers, and A=422 Hz, which would<br/>not please audiences that had become accustomed to much more<br/>brilliance. Of course, other than in France, there was no reason that<br/>bands and orchestras should consider themselves forever constrained by<br/>A=435 Hz and the reduction in brilliance compared to the recent past.<br/>  In any case, Britain in the last decades of the nineteenth century<br/>went its own way. In 1896, London&apos;s Royal Philharmonic Society got<br/>around the practice of A=435 Hz in what appears to have been a<br/>contrived way. By the 1880s, scientists were able to calculate the<br/>amount by which the pitch of a wind instrument varies with room<br/>temperature. In Britain it was a common, but erroneous, belief that<br/>when the 1859 French commission decreed A=435 Hz, it had not specified<br/>an absolute frequency, but had specified 59o F as the room temperature<br/>under which the particular construction of the pitch-giving instrument<br/>(oboe) played A=435 Hz. The Philharmonic Society, on the advice of<br/>their consultant, therefore reasoned that the same instrument, at<br/>normal room temperature, 68o F, would play the A above middle C as:<br/>435 + [(68-59)&div;1000 &times; 435] = 438.915 Hz</p><p>which is A=439 Hz to the nearest integer. As a result, in 1896, A=439<br/>Hz became a recognized pitch standard in Britain. In North America,<br/>meanwhile, the pitch of pianos and orchestras not only remained<br/>unstandardized in the first decades of the twentieth century but<br/>continued to creep upward...&quot;</p><p>Try also an other view:<br/><a href="http://drjazz.ca/musicians/pitchhistory.html">http://drjazz.ca/musicians/pitchhistory.html</a></p><p>Yours Sincerely<br/>A.S.</p></div>
