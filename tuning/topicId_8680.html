Sanderson Accutuner.

I had a long discussion with<br/>Katie Hafner, concerning the temperament revival, but saw no mention in the<br/>article.  Ah well, maybe later.<br/>   The Accu-Tuner is a very advanced piece of gear,  I have been using one<br/>professionally for years, and have never been in a situation where its curves<br/>or tempering didn&apos;t do the job.  Yo Yo Ma played a piano/cello duet with this<br/>piano, tuned exactly to the machine&apos;s decisions, and was happy with the<br/>result,  so I relax a little bit about the abilities.<br/>   One of the most important features of these machines is that they allow<br/>the application of various temperaments to pianos, with no extra work. This<br/>is having a growing effect, 60 % of my customers are now using well tempered<br/>tunings and have no thought of going back to ET.  This includes a growing<br/>number of professional musicians.<br/>   The other important aspect is that an aural tuning can be recorded, and<br/>used over and over again, being tweaked and improved each time. This<br/>cumulative refinement allows a very polished tuning to evolve on a particular<br/>model and brand of piano.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@cix.compulink.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2000 1:55:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:200002172038_MC2-99AA-8B0A@compuserve.com">200002172038_MC2-99AA-8B0A@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just for the curious who live in the NYC environs, or who can get the<br/>&gt; New<br/>&gt; York Times... there is an interesting article in TODAY&apos;s Times,<br/>&gt; &quot;Circuits&quot;<br/>&gt; section, on piano tuning with frequency counters and computers ...</p><p>Well, you certainly don&apos;t need to live anywhere near New York to read the<br/>Times.
