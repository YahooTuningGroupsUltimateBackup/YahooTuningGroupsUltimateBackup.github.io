I haven&apos;t been focusing on your threads lately. Little time<br/>these days, but this stuff is definitly catching my eye. I apologize<br/>if I&apos;m too far behind on this to ask anything but very naive<br/>questions, but I have a couple:</p><p>1. How are two generators employed? Are they just separately iterated<br/>from a reference pitch some arbitrary number of times, like the<br/>secor, for example, then perhaps closed using some really tight<br/>approximation as a unison vector? Then you have two parallel scales<br/>that interleave to form one scale, each generator seeding half the<br/>pitches as subsets of the full scale?</p><p>2. What do you mean by &quot;The 72-et can be tempered via the<br/>&gt; ennealimmal temperament&quot;, since 72-tET is already a temperament?<br/>Are you modifying it to transform it into an irregular temperament<br/>with uneven steps in order to exploit the nearer-JI advantages of<br/>ennealimmal?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; The focus has been on seeing the 72-et either in terms of the secor<br/>&gt; or as 6x12; however the ennealimmal picture which focuses on 8x9<br/>has<br/>&gt; a lot to be said for it.

The 36/35 or<br/>quarter-tone generator we can now regard as creating stacks of 9-ets.<br/>There are various ways of closing that up to make the whole thing<br/>into an et if you like--8 makes the 72 et, 11 the 99 et, 19 the 171<br/>et, 30 the 270 et, 49 the 441 et and 68 the 612 et. Obviously, this<br/>involves too many notes for most purposes.</p><p>&gt; 2. What do you mean by &quot;The 72-et can be tempered via the<br/>&gt; &gt; ennealimmal temperament&quot;, since 72-tET is already a temperament?</p><p>The 12-et is also a temperament, by your definition, but that does<br/>not stop us from tempering it via meantone. If and when people<br/>finally decide on a 72-et notation I&apos;ll show what an ennealimmal<br/>tempered version would look like. We can choose a value of exactly 49<br/>cents for the quarter-tone (3 72-et steps) generator, which is as<br/>good as anything and very close to the 441 and 612 values. We then<br/>end up adding exactly two cents to the 3/2 and 7/4 of the 72-et, and<br/>three cents to the 5/4; this makes these values very, very, very<br/>good. We may use the ennealimmal temperament in conjunction with the<br/>secor, getting more than one size of secor, and slightly altered<br/>versions of Blackjack and Canasta with some effectively just<br/>harmonies.</p></div>
