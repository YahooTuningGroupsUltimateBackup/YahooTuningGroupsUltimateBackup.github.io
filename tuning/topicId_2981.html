Science has once again brought us to the<br/>&gt; &gt; same place. No transcendence of nature is desirable until you know<br/>&gt; &gt; what nature is!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m glad you added that last part, because, aside from any other<br/>&gt; arguments against Hitler (of course there are many, and fully<br/>&gt; justified), the one that pertains here is that he was absolutely<br/>&gt; wrong about the &apos;defective gene pool&apos; idea.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We know today that *diversity* of genetic combination, and not<br/>&gt; &apos;purity&apos;, is what creates stronger, healthier, and in every way<br/>&gt; better, offspring.<br/>&gt;</p><p>All diversity is not homogeneous ;-).  There are genetic variations<br/>that are fatal or debilitating.  One could draw from this that you<br/>oppose research into MD and other birth defects.  One must be<br/>able to divine between what is variation and what is pathology,<br/>exactly as is occurring in the human genome project.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s just one more reason why Milosevich and his gang of<br/>&gt; Serbian butchers pisses me off so much.  His idea of &apos;ethnic<br/>&gt; cleansing&apos; follows directly from der Fuhrer&apos;s principles.</p><p>&quot;Ethnic Cleansing&quot; deals with forced expulsion based on ethnic<br/>group, not with genocide.  Your equation of the two does a great<br/>injustice to the Jewish people.</p><p>The along-awaited report by the U.S. State Department, released<br/>10-May-99 entitled &quot;Erasing History: Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo&quot;<br/>puts the worst light possible on Serbia, but here the number of<br/>Albanian Kosovars killed by the Yugoslavs is put at 4,000.  The<br/>Yugoslavs claim half that number.  For a civil war, especially one<br/>of urban guerrilla warfare of this magnitude, this number of<br/>casualties is minimum.  In the U.S. civil war, for example, there<br/>were over 600,000 casualties.</p><p>Polychroni</p></div>
