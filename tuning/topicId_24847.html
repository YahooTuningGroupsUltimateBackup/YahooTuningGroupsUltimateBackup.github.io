In fact, most often, will make some mistakes even<br/>at 5 cents apart.</p><p>However, if I try to keep a steady pitch (very carefully, as I did for<br/>this clip), then the CoolEdit results seem to suggest I can keep it steady<br/>to about 1/3 of a cent most of the time. Occasional blips such as the 521 Hz<br/>blip at the start of the 519 Hz note, but they are very short duration and<br/>it is clear the note is being kept steady most of the time, and from beginning to<br/>end of note without any pitch drift either.</p><p>I suppose that could be by feeling the breath pressure, but it seems<br/>somehow more likely that in some sense, a 1/3 cent pitch increment<br/>is indeed &quot;heard&quot; - in some other sense of hearing. Maybe one could<br/>even eventually learn to be more used to and confident in that<br/>and actually achieve 1/3 cent accuracy in pitch judgements?</p><p>Also when I try to match a heard note with another pitch, I generally<br/>do it by playing the note I want to match, then playing the note<br/>to match with it, rather than playing both notes simultaneously<br/>and looking for beats / roughness. Again I think it is possible<br/>to match it to less than 4 cents, even though, if someone else<br/>were to do it, one probably wouldn&apos;t notice a discrepency of,<br/>say, 2 cents.</p><p>So who can tell what kind of accuracy one could achieve in<br/>actual performance. I.e. when one relies on feeling the notes<br/>and goes with the music, rather than trying to work everything<br/>out.</p><p>Maybe in the future with more microtonal performances, 1 cent<br/>accuracy will even seem tame.</p><p>I&apos;m interested to hear what Haresh has to say if he is still<br/>subscribed to the TL, as the Indian musicians have been playing<br/>in j.i. and with small intervals in a very long and highly<br/>sophisticated tradition and seems to me, may well have<br/>particularly refined pitch perception.</p><p>Are you there Haresh??</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=24853 href="#24853">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/10/2001 7:50:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/10/01 10:38:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:robertwalker@ntlworld.com">robertwalker@ntlworld.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Maybe one could<br/>&gt; even eventually learn to be more used to and confident in that<br/>&gt; and actually achieve 1/3 cent accuracy in pitch judgements?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve enjoyed your responses to this thread.  Now, that you mention it, by<br/>playing accurate JI, I already play finer than a single cent.  Rudolf Rasch<br/>of Utrecht in the Netherlands wrote of heart jitter. This could be as much as<br/>some cents of interruption based on heartbeat action.  A wind instrument is<br/>not as directly connected to the musical tone as singing a tone (except maybe<br/>recorder).  The breathing is developed in a manner that keeps the pressure on<br/>the diaphragm constant.  So, the bassoon is even more accurate, at least as<br/>concerns jitter.</p><p>Since JI ratios are actually heard at points between whole number cents, I<br/>can perform even more accurately than I have previously stated.  I am well<br/>aware of producing a JI interval, independent of counting cents.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=24857 href="#24857">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 8:06:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert 1<br/>    Sorry to interject but the trick is the higher one will seem louder</p><p>Robert Walker wrote:</p><p>&gt; If presented with two notes one after another, only 2 cents apart, I<br/>&gt; normally can&apos;t tell which is the sharper of the two, and will often get it wrong</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
