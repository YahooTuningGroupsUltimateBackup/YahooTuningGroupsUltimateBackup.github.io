If Brad wants to say that Mark Lindley is<br/>cheating, let him say so straight out and take responsibility for the<br/>accusation, rather than insinuating.</p><p>Smears against specific but unnamed people are almost impossible to<br/>refute - unless you are thoroughly familiar with the history of the<br/>debate. But I happen to know Mark Lindley is the only person Brad<br/>could possibly be referring to here.</p><p>I will try to explain what Lindley said about the Ab prelude in Book<br/>I, and related questions, without distortions or inaccuracies, so far<br/>as I remember it.</p><p>But first, let&apos;s get two things straight: you can&apos;t call it &apos;cheating&apos;<br/>to play certain chords staccato, if you like it that way. And you<br/>can&apos;t call it &apos;cheating&apos; to suggest that Bach&apos;s tuning probably<br/>changed over the years between 1722 and 1744.</p><p>Like Brad, Mark Lindley believes that temperament is one element of a<br/>convincing performance - which interacts with other elements in that<br/>(for example) the sound of tempered chords will influence how a<br/>performer plays them, in conjunction with other features of the music.<br/>I experienced this at first hand, at a lecture-demonstration last year.</p><p>Lindley noted that, in his opinion, and independently of any choice of<br/>tuning, the E major and Ab major preludes in &apos;Book 1&apos; have contrasting<br/>characters and types of articulation. The E major piece is pastoral,<br/>relaxed, with many sustained and tied-over notes, and an essentially<br/>legato line. Ab major is brisk and vigorous, with many isolated chords<br/>punctuated by rests, or two-part passage-work in 16th- and 8th-notes,<br/>which should probably be performed with mainly detached articulation.</p><p>Lindley believes that a tuning in which Ab-C is sharper than E-G#<br/>(though not so sharp as 81/64!) would contribute positively to the<br/>expression of these characters. For instance a relatively<br/>rapidly-beating third Ab-c inside the first chord of the Ab Prelude<br/>might encourage a performer to release this chord a little earlier<br/>than its notated value - which Lindley believes would be musically<br/>beneficial. Contrariwise, the E-G# third at the beginning of the E<br/>Prelude would beat relatively slowly and encourage the performer to<br/>hold the notes down as notated, creating a gentler and more legato<br/>character. (Similar remarks apply to arpeggios in the C major, F#<br/>major Preludes.)</p><p>And in general, he thinks that the different characters of these two<br/>keys in his type of tuning suit the different characters of the<br/>preludes - but not so much in Lehman&apos;s, where the sizes of the thirds<br/>are the other way round.</p><p>Lindley does not under any circumstances accept that the chord of Ab<br/>major, as he would have it in WTC book I, contains &apos;tuning flaws&apos;. In<br/>his opinion, a performance with his type of tuning and with detached<br/>articulation would be musically optimal. To say that the detached<br/>articulation is intended to &apos;hide&apos; the tuning of the chord is a gross<br/>misrepresentation. On the contrary, the articulation and the tuning,<br/>experienced together, create the artistic impression.</p><p>You might as well say that Bach &apos;cheated&apos; by &apos;hiding&apos; the note C in<br/>the middle of a chord!!</p><p>Other people may of course prefer different types of tuning, where<br/>different chords have thirds that are as sharp (or sharper!) than<br/>Lindley&apos;s proposed Ab-C; they may also prefer different playing<br/>styles. This does not justify Brad, or anyone else, saying that<br/>Lindley&apos;s views constitute &apos;cheating&apos;.</p><p>As for the &apos;Book II&apos; Ab prelude, Lindley had not explicitly discussed<br/>it. I will add for myself that its compositional features are<br/>consistent with the idea that Bach&apos;s tuning became closer to ET later<br/>in life.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>(cc to Lindley)</p></div><h3>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2007 8:52:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love to suggest that we have a combo listening-test-and-vote-<br/>for-your-favorite-temperament based on the following criteria:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THE PIECE:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         WTC-I, Ab major<br/>         (all here would agree that a key approaching the farther<br/>side of the circle but perhaps not all the way would be best, no?)</p><p>Both Prelude and fugue?</p><p>&gt; THE INSTRUMENT:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         something neutral and unobjectionable, perhaps a single<br/>moog-like sawtooth wave with a decay on the filter to mimic a<br/>harpsichord.
