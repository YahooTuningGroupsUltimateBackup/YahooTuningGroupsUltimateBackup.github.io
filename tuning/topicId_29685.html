In fact, just<br/>done a &quot;eulogy to NWC&quot; web page.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/noteworthy.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/noteworthy.htm</a></p><p>If one wants to get the music onto paper, and is used<br/>to working visually, rather than using midi sequencing to<br/>make the score, then I think Noteworthy Composr is<br/>hard to beat.</p><p>The tempo changes, dynamic variance and flow directions<br/>on the score are respected in the playback.</p><p>E.g. when you do special endings for a repeat section,<br/>just click the play button and you hear them all exactly<br/>as written. Ditto for D.C Al Coda, D.C. Al Fine, D.S. Al Coda,<br/>etc.</p><p>Same applies if to dynamics, and crescendi, and diminuendi<br/>all respected. Also tempi and accelerandi or decellerandi..</p><p>Do any other score editing programs do that I wonder?</p><p>You can also save the whole piece immediately as a<br/>midi clip.</p><p>Then you can retune the midi clip in Scala, (also play it in<br/>the new FTS retuning midi player too<br/>and try varying the temperament).</p><p>Also of course, you can retune the playback<br/>via Midi Yoke and Midi Relay or my FTS,<br/>but that applies to any score editing<br/>program that is able to play the score via midi.</p><p>You could also retune notes individually as you can<br/>add pitch bends to the score, but never done that myself<br/>so I don&apos;t know how well it works. A glance at the slide<br/>controller for the pitch bend rather suggests that<br/>after clicking it in position with mouse,<br/>single step increments are perhaps 20 or so pitch bend<br/>steps, so could be hard to position it at an exact<br/>pitch bend, but having got that done, one could<br/>copy and paste the pitch bend for all the notes that<br/>require the accidental.</p><p>You can put a note or a phrase on a new staff in NWC, and then<br/>layer it with the previous staff to make a single<br/>line of the score, which is useful at times.</p><p>The pitch bends would also be respected by FTS, if midi<br/>relaying, and would be interpreted as additional pitch bends<br/>on top of whatever scale one was using. That could be useful on occasion.</p><p>You can also add linear controller sweeps of up to four points,<br/>so could do pitch bend glissandi that way.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
