For the time being, let&apos;s accept the premise<br/>that all of the primary tonalities of the diamond are &apos;in G&apos; (which is,<br/>itself, a non-traditional definition of a tonality).

It is extremely interesting, as a question in the<br/>history of musical style, that both figures would have developed tonal<br/>systems predicated on inversional symmetry and further, that both tonal<br/>styles develop vertically by the addition of identities. Tonal progression<br/>around the diamond could be reduced to a kind of harmonic &quot;planing&quot; on<br/>overtone series whose fundamentals are related as undertone series (and<br/>vice versa) while 12-tone technique progresses by series whose origins are<br/>related by inversion.</p><p>One deficit of both systems, from opposite causes, is in the quality of<br/>progressions. The movement from X-tonality to X-tonality in the diamond<br/>would seem to be directed inevitably at the tonic major. Partch responded<br/>by favoring interesting harmonic ostinati (in &apos;tonal flux&apos; relations), and<br/>used the tonic Otonality with relatively low frequency. Twelve-tone<br/>technique, in the progression from row to row, lacks any directional<br/>priority.</p></div><h3><a id=1693 href="#1693">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/1999 4:05:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; [Monzo, TD 102:]<br/>&gt;&gt; But an important point contra this, recognized by<br/>&gt;&gt; both Schoenberg and Partch, is that the higher the<br/>&gt;&gt; odd/prime factors become, the less strongly they<br/>&gt;&gt; imply the local 1/1.  The ambiguity is introduced<br/>&gt;&gt; by the very largeness, or complexity, of the numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>[Wolf, TD 102:]<br/>&gt; I have to disagree with this. &lt;snip&gt; Ambiguity in the<br/>&gt; Partch diamond occurs only with the 9 and /9 tonalites<br/>&gt; in that they also form (via &quot;wormholes&quot; periodicities)<br/>&gt; 3 relationships to the 3 and /3 tonalities.</p><p>Your point about Partch&apos;s music is well taken.<br/>I should have made it clear that I was referring more<br/>to his theories as expounded in _Genesis_ than in<br/>his actual compositional practice, which was sometimes<br/>a bit different.  Partch speaks clearly of this<br/>amgbiguity (of higher-limit resources) in his book.</p><p>&gt; If we go further and consider the resources of the<br/>&gt; extended Partchian gamut, it is far richer in non-G<br/>&gt; tonalities at lower limits than at higher<br/>&gt; limits. The resources involving 7, 9, and 11 identities<br/>&gt; are increasingly restricted to the G tonalities and<br/>&gt; have a net effect of reifying the centrality of G,<br/>&gt; not of introducing ambiguity.</p><p>Again, I can agree with you here regarding Partch&apos;s<br/>compositional practice.  Two things that were just<br/>posted here recently reinforce what you&apos;re saying:</p><p>[Monzo, TD 99:]<br/>&gt; Even along the higher-prime axes, we still tend to<br/>&gt; think in terms of a chain of powers of 3.  For example,<br/>&gt; while avoiding all ratios having 5 as a factor, La Monte<br/>&gt; Young, in the lattice of his tunings, still deploys<br/>&gt; chains of powers of 3 among the 7-limit ratios.</p><p>[Lumma, TD 102:]<br/>&gt; Wilson has shown that Partch (unconsciously) selected<br/>&gt; his secondary ratios based on a linear series<br/>&gt; (chain of fifths).</p><p>It&apos;s true that in Partch&apos;s system, lower-limit resources<br/>reinforced &quot;lateral modulation&quot; while his higher-limit<br/>resources produced centricity.</p><p>My main point was that as the limit increases, the<br/>size of the numbers themselves introduces an element<br/>of ambiguity into the system.  While Partch&apos;s 7-9-11<br/>resources may have emphasized the 1/1 &quot;G&quot;, they<br/>certainly did so with much less strength than the 1-3-5<br/>resources.</p><p>Perhaps if his tonal system had been constructed<br/>with more higher-limit resources on other &quot;local 1/1s&quot;<br/>the type of ambiguity I&apos;m discussing would have<br/>been more pronounced in his music.</p><p>[Wolf:]<br/>&gt; On the other hand, the ambiguity with which Schoenberg<br/>&gt; was dealing is essentially a property of temperament.</p><p>Also agreed.  My main reason for bringing Schoenberg<br/>into this was to show why he decided to keep the 12-Eq<br/>resources, when he was aware of more subtle tuning<br/>possibilites.  One would think that someone interested<br/>in expanded tonal resources would make use of these<br/>alternative tunings, but he didn&apos;t, and it was because<br/>he wanted to preserve and *make use of the ambiguity*<br/>built into the 12-Eq system.</p><p>Schoenberg realized how vast the possibilities of rational<br/>implications in music are, and from a practical point<br/>of view, he didn&apos;t feel it was necessary *at that point<br/>in musical history* to grapple with the expanded resources.<br/>He made clear his belief that by early in the next century<br/>(the one approaching now), musicians would indeed begin<br/>to use more finely-divided scales than the 12-Eq system.</p><p>{Wolf:]<br/>&gt; It is extremely interesting, as a question in the<br/>&gt; history of musical style, that both figures would have<br/>&gt; developed tonal systems predicated on inversional symmetry<br/>&gt; and further, that both tonal styles develop vertically<br/>&gt; by the addition of identities.</p><p>I find it very interesting indeed that Partch and<br/>Schoenberg made use of similar formal structures in<br/>their tonal systems while, in a sense, going about<br/>it in exactly opposite ways.</p><p>[Wolf:]<br/>&gt; The movement from X-tonality to X-tonality in the diamond<br/>&gt; would seem to be directed inevitably at the tonic major.<br/>&gt; Partch responded by favoring interesting harmonic ostinati<br/>&gt; (in &apos;tonal flux&apos; relations)</p><p>Please - give some examples of this from his music.<br/>I&apos;d be interested in studying it.</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
