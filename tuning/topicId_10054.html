The<br/>explanation of your solution for easily representing both the &quot;comma<br/>number&quot; and octave number (if desired) in ASCII is especially attractive.</p><p>Incidentally -- and this may just be my personal quirk -- on first reading<br/>your notation, I noticed a curious coincidence. If the default comma<br/>number is taken as &quot;5&quot;, then a pure major third like 5C5 4E5 (with the E a<br/>comma number lower than the C, or in other words a syntonic comma smaller<br/>than Pythagorean) will suggest by the comma numbers the ratio 5:4. Another<br/>way of stating this is that the 5th partial of 5C5 will coincide with the<br/>4th partial of 4E5. Of course, this is just a fortuitous consequence of<br/>choosing a default comma number of &quot;5&quot;, but nevertheless could have<br/>mnenomic value. (Here I&apos;m counting the fundamental as the &quot;first<br/>partial.&quot;)</p><p>Likewise with a pure minor third such as 5E5 6G5 -- suggesting the ratio<br/>of 5:6, although here it&apos;s the _fifth_ partial of G which will coincide<br/>with the _sixth_ partial of E.</p><p>Of course, one might say that with 5C5 4E5, the &quot;5:4&quot; represents the<br/>string-ratio (or organ-pipe ratio, etc.), while with 5E5 6G5 the<br/>&quot;5:6&quot; represents the frequency-ratio.</p><p>Anyway, I found the notation readable, and noticed for example that in<br/>your example of a 5-limit scale, the interval 5D5 4A5 or the like would be<br/>a narrow &quot;Wolf&quot; fifth at 40:27, as is common in such examples.</p><p>Incidentally, the part about 72-tet on six keyboards was very interesting.<br/>At first blush, I wondered if an adjustment of 16-2/3 cent might be a bit<br/>small, given that the syntonic comma of 81:80 is about 21.51 cents (closer<br/>to a step in 60-tet) -- but then I remembered that given the &quot;geometry&quot; of<br/>12-tet, subtracting 16-2/3 cents (or 1/72 octave) from a 12-tet major<br/>third gives something very close to a just 5:4. Since a precise adjustment<br/>would be about 13.69 cents, the result is actually a major third about 3<br/>cents _narrower_ than pure, quite close to a Pythagorean schisma major<br/>third (or diminished fourth) about 1.95 cents narrower than pure.</p><p>An aside: I&apos;ve experimented with Pythagorean on two 12-note keyboards, a<br/>&quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; tuning providing the usual 3-limit intervals plus various<br/>5-limit and 7-limit approximations for intervals generally treated as<br/>unstable in a Gothic or &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; stylistic setting. I wonder if a<br/>notation based on Pythagorean rather than syntonic comma numbers might fit<br/>this system. For example, using your &quot;5&quot; as a default comma number,</p><p>5D4 6F#4</p><p>would be a major third a Pythagorean comma wider than the usual 81:64,<br/>possibly the kind of wide cadential interval Marchettus of Padua<br/>(1318) may have intended for a progression such as</p><p>6F#4  5G4<br/>5D4   5C4</p><p>Here we have a new &quot;isotope&quot; of the standard M3-5 resolution by stepwise<br/>contrary motion, with the major third a comma wider than usual, and the<br/>melodic semitone in the upper part a comma narrower than the usual limma<br/>of 256:243 (or ~90.22 cents) -- or about 66.76 cents, a kind of<br/>&quot;third-tone&quot; interval.</p><p>Also, I wonder if such a notation could be made &quot;three-dimensional&quot; for<br/>7-limit JI, etc.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=10072 href="#10072">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/19/2000 9:26:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:Pine.BSF.4.20.0005180921130.66396-100000@value.net">Pine.BSF.4.20.0005180921130.66396-100000@value.net</a>&gt;<br/>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, I wonder if such a notation could be made &quot;three-dimensional&quot; for<br/>&gt; 7-limit JI, etc.</p><p>I did look at this once.  For a meantone approximating 7-limit harmony,<br/>you can define two commas, and two fractions for each tuning.  I think it<br/>works, but I found it too complex to keep up with.  It&apos;s easier to use<br/>decimal fractions of a single comma, or state the size of the fifth in<br/>cents or the interval you&apos;re setting just.</p><p>    Graham</p></div>
