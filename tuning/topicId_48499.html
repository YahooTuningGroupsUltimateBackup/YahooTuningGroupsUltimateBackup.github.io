How big or small is the distance?  That&apos;s a<br/>size--big or small.  Also:  an inch is a distance; an inch is a size.</p><p>&quot;Size&quot; of an interval is a common usage (no?), so no use trying to get rid<br/>of the word, preferring distance instead.</p><p>The size of a one-dimensional quantity is the distance between its<br/>endpoints.  The pitches are the endpoints.  The size of the interval is the<br/>distance between the pitches.  There, I think that finishes the thought.<br/>The pitches have a distance (between them).  The interval has a size.  The<br/>interval is the space between the pitches.  The *measurement* of the<br/>interval interval equals the measurement of distance between the pitches.</p><p>So if you are going to &quot;split hairs&quot; as someone said, you need to<br/>distinguish a thing from a measurement of the thing.  Maybe you want to ask<br/>the question whether the thing exists or only the measurement.  However<br/>language does not make this distinction.  Language follows its form<br/>regardless of whether all its objects and constructs have an &quot;actual&quot;<br/>referent.  So even if an interval has no real existence outside of its<br/>perceived size, in language we have the phrase &quot;size of an interval&quot;, and so<br/>in language we have the abstract existence of interval, distinct from its<br/>size.</p><p>Insert words like &quot;subjective&quot; where needed but I think they are possibly<br/>redundant.  Existence is never explicit.  This is my bias in language, which<br/>I think should be recognized as a poetic regardless of technical content.<br/>The desire to make *everything* explicit is a trap because there is always<br/>more.  The sense that a description is complete is probably erroneous.<br/>Therefore to me the most complete language is the least embellished.  Adding<br/>more begs adding more yet.  Adding the least possible creates a true unit of<br/>language - something we could become more sensitive to but have little<br/>experience with.  A dictionary that followed this form would be one powerful<br/>book!</p><p>I see that I have not read all the threads that I should have read before<br/>replying, but I will leave this as it stands anyway.  If people just used<br/>one subject instead of 5 for a given thread, I would not have missed all the<br/>background.   ;)</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d say distance, not size.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; David Beardsley<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

As you have rightly pointed out, the<br/>&gt; term &apos;interval&apos;, simply, is the distance between things; in music, it is the<br/>&gt; distance between two sounds/pitches/tones/notes [I prefer &apos;pitches&apos;] The term<br/>&gt; &apos;distance&apos; can be elucidated under Remarks/explanation/note, and can be so<br/>&gt; many things. No problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The complexities start as soon as we see &apos;interval&apos; in a larger perspective:<br/>&gt; Like, for example, it means &quot;Distance and relationship between two pitches&quot;.<br/>&gt; And, please look at this: &quot;A set containing all points (or all real numbers)<br/>&gt; between two given endpoints (the pitches, in the present context).&quot;</p><p>Yes, well in spite of the fact that you said &quot;real numbers&quot; implying a<br/>continuous range of pitches, I couldn&apos;t help but reading into what you said<br/>that a discrete set of pitches (e.g. a scale) might be assumed in some<br/>contexts, and this makes the definition of the &quot;size&quot; of an interval get<br/>even more interesting.</p><p>Alas, I should know better than to hope for orthogonality in language (or in<br/>a dictionary).

In historical tunings (such as the<br/>meantone<br/>&gt; temperament) in which the fifths were different in size from those<br/>in<br/>&gt; 12-ET, the enharmonic sharps and flats are different pitches, so<br/>&gt; intervals such as the minor 3rd and augmented 2nd are different in<br/>&gt; size.  Since the fifths of 12-ET are exactly 7/12 of an octave, a<br/>&gt; chain of 12 fifths (reduced by 7 octaves) will return you to the<br/>&gt; starting tone, which causes the 12-ET pitches that represent<br/>&gt; enharmonically related tones to be exactly the same.  This also<br/>&gt; causes enharmonically related intervals in 12-ET to be the same<br/>size;<br/>&gt; however, they actually have *very different functions* in diatonic<br/>&gt; scales (as demonstrated by the chain-of-fifths diagram above) that<br/>we<br/>&gt; are able to hear in a diatonic context.</p><p>While George is absolutely correct that the diatonic system,<br/>historically, was almost always tuned as a chain of fifths, one can<br/>base the explanation instead on the &apos;fiction&apos; of the just intonation<br/>diatonic system, which is not a chain of fifths. One then sees that<br/>the argument can be detached from the particular interval of the<br/>fifth, and framed in more general terms as one of &apos;periodicity&apos;.<br/>Hopefully this paper (skip the first section, marked &apos;optional&apos;, if<br/>you wish) will give you the ideas necessary to do this:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a></p><p>&gt; As Paul suggested, you should play around with a harmonic minor<br/>scale<br/>&gt; to hear this for yourself.  And if you get a chance, a real ear-<br/>&gt; opener is to listen to something played in meantone temperament (in<br/>a<br/>&gt; minor key) that contains augmented 2nds or augmented 5ths, which<br/>&gt; sound very different from the minor 3rds and 6ths to which they are<br/>&gt; enharmonically related.</p></div><h3><a id=48642 href="#48642">ðŸ”—</a>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2003 8:26:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
