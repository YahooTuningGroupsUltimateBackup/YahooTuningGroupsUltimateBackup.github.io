MIDI harpsichordists may not like this, but<br/>since Note OFF is unofficially an orphan message sitting there<br/>first on the list, having long ago been replaced by Note ON<br/>velocity 0, what about changing the Note OFF message into<br/>a Note TUNE message? The format could be just like Pitch Bend:</p><p>1000nnnn  0ccccccc  0fffffff</p><p>n = channel<br/>c = course tuning<br/>f = fine tuning</p><p>But this message would work independent of Pitch Bend (meaning<br/>Pitch Bend would have the expected effect on any TUNEd Note), and<br/>it would apply only to the note message that follows it on the given<br/>channel. The TUNE range would also be independent of the channel<br/>bend range and would be _fixed at + / - a quartertone, not requiring<br/>any new RPNs for messing with the TUNE range, giving 196,608<br/>steps per octave.</p><p>Tuning a note would then be done in 2 messages, just like is done<br/>using Pitch Bend, but the results would be exactly what is needed:<br/>every note independently tunable (and also bendable after being tuned).<br/>No sysex or any other messages needed.</p><p>This would of course require recoding of all Note OFF message<br/>interpretations in all future software and firmware. I guess it is<br/>essentially the same as Robert Walker&apos;s idea using RPNs, except that<br/>instead of an RPN which is out there in a list of other obscure RPN<br/>messages, it is the first message on the basic channel message list.<br/>Both this idea and new RPN require a change in the spec.</p><p>I guess the response to this will be &quot;it&apos;s too radical a change, and RPNs<br/>make more sense for something new in the spec&quot;. But consider this:</p><p>I think this would be better, because I feel if the spec has to change, the<br/>visibility of the message within the spec will have an impact on its<br/>adoption. It would be hard to miss it as a basic channel message, and<br/>the first message in the spec, to boot.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=70993 href="#70993">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2007 6:05:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It&apos;s a clever idea, but then how would you tune a note that is already<br/>on?

Maybe we should just pack<br/>up and go home. MTS has been out there for, what, 10 years?<br/>It&apos;s old news. It&apos;s been picked up by the ones who care. The<br/>others will never come around. Why bother?</p><p>I mean, if you want to do something with tuning, MIDI is not<br/>the way to go! We&apos;ve known that for a long time. Go program in<br/>C-Sound or MSP, or Bidule or Supercollider. Heck, get yourself<br/>a Commodore 64 and you&apos;ve got 3 voices easy to program for<br/>Just Intonation! Just write a few lines of BASIC; who cares about<br/>MIDI! While you&apos;re at it, just forget hardware. Hardware is just<br/>going to control software from now on, right?</p><p>So why is it that all the software is still supporting MIDI? And<br/>why is it that CCs are supported and tuning sysexes aren&apos;t? Is<br/>it really a matter of people not caring about tuning? The majority<br/>rules? We&apos;re up against the 12ET establishment and all that? I&apos;m<br/>not sure...</p><p>Pitch Bend exists. People use it. In Eur-Asia MIDI Pitch Bend is used<br/>for on-the-fly monophonic tuning. As early as 1983 microtonal<br/>polyphony using Pitch Bend was experimented with. A lot of<br/>software has been written to use it that way. You wrote one such<br/>program, Graham. Why? I assume because you wanted a way to make<br/>some microtonal music, and the blasted MIDI spec didn&apos;t make it so<br/>easy, so you went and wrote your own program to hack around MIDI<br/>and get the job done. And as you know, you&apos;re not the only one. And<br/>you didn&apos;t do it using sysex.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=71020 href="#71020">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@h-pi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2007 11:28:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; CCs don&apos;t have RPN timing issues, do they?</p><p>Oh, I guess RPNs, being CCs, would mean the other CCs I&apos;m<br/>suggesting would probably have the same timing issues.

I&apos;m not sure if it is actually a policy decision on their part, or just a pragmatic thing that there is nowhere to put the channel number. If it is a purely pragmatic thing, then utting a channel number into the data bytes is a possible solution - but is confusing however, and it is a kludge agreed.</p><p>Aaron - On the idea of the note off as a retune, another idea is to use a special RPN which switches on Note off retuning.</p><p>e.g.<br/>coarse rpn 10 data 1 - changes note off to note tune</p><p>note off &lt;note number&gt; &lt;tuning type&gt; - selects note to retune, and type of tuning (note specific, 12tone accidental, polyphonic pitch bends, and any other type one might add to the spec)</p><p>note off &lt;bend high&gt; &lt;bend low&gt; - bends it</p><p>coarse rpn 127 - null the active parameter - note off reverts to its usual function<br/>There - any other rpn would also switch off this &quot;note off retuning&quot; - so the note off counts as a note tune only for as long as 10 is the active coarse rpn.</p><p>Then repeat the process for each note you want to retune:<br/>coarse rpn 10 data 1 - changes note off to note tune<br/>note off &lt;note number&gt; &lt;tuning type&gt; - selects note to retune<br/>note off &lt;bend high&gt; &lt;bend low&gt; - bends it<br/>coarse rpn 127 - null the active parameter</p><p>etc so you expect a pair of note offs each time, first to select the note then to retune the selected note.</p><p>You could go on doing alternate pairs of note offs - receiving software would treat note offs as alternately selecting the note to retune and tuning type, then retuning it, until the active parameter is changed or nulled. But it would be good practice to null the active parameter after each pair of note off type note tunes for the usual reason that otherwise if a cable is unplugged before the rpn is nulled, then note off retuning would stay active from then on in the receiving synth.</p><p>On the sysexes, the tricky thing about them is that they are variable length, so there is a bit more coding involved. In the windows API then you have a separate set of function calls to send Sysexes, and also to prepare your program to receive them (you have to create a sysex buffer to receive the sysexes and have to prepare it using special Windows routines for that as well).</p><p>So - prob. because of the extra coding to detect and send them - some midi relaying software doesn&apos;t relay sysexes (e.g. the Maple virtual midi cable) and some software isn&apos;t programmed to send or receive them. For instance originally FTS couldn&apos;t send or receive any sysexes, and it was only a few years after the program was originally written that I added in that capability.</p><p>So using ordinary short messages for pitch bends instead of sysexes does simplify the coding all round, so I think it might lead to more take up for the retuning than for the tuning sysexes. In my case, I could have added that in at an early stage in FTS before adding the code for sysexes, so it is also kind of friendly to Midi programmers whose programs are at a fairly early stage of development.</p><p>On using portamento to achieve a bend by playing the note again without articulation - it&apos;s poss. but support for it is patchy, and it may require monomode to be on, if so then you only have one note playing in the channel.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=71024 href="#71024">ðŸ”—</a>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2007 4:54:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron,</p><p>Yes I think so, BTW sysexes can be sent asynchronously in a separate data stream (perhaps to avoid large sysexes blocking the stream of short messages) so there is a concern about whether they will always be tied in serially with the stream of short messages which is another advantage of using short messages instead of the sysexes.</p><p>So if you send a midi tuning sysex immediately before the note to be retuned, you don&apos;t know for sure that it will be received in time - so it is best usually to retune it well in advance.</p><p>So the CCs are better in that respect - there the thing is the CCs will be received in strict serial order since they are always sent in the same data stream as the note ons, but the synth receiving them might re-order them or a midi file parser might re-order them - but that is fixable by recoding the midi file parser or synth if the author is enthusiastic about it, and in many cases they won&apos;t re-order them so then no recoding is needed.</p><p>Robert</p><p>................<br/>Oh, I guess RPNs, being CCs, would mean the other CCs I&apos;m<br/>suggesting would probably have the same timing issues.

But it&apos;s not going to replace the existing &gt;&gt;standard because the standard is already good enough.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know, Graham. Maybe it is. Maybe we should just pack &gt; up and go home. MTS has been out there for, what, 10 years?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s old news. It&apos;s been picked up by the ones who care. The &gt; others will never come around. Why bother?</p><p>Why bother doing what?</p><p>&gt; I mean, if you want to do something with tuning, MIDI is not &gt; the way to go! We&apos;ve known that for a long time. Go program in &gt; C-Sound or MSP, or Bidule or Supercollider. Heck, get yourself &gt; a Commodore 64 and you&apos;ve got 3 voices easy to program for &gt; Just Intonation! Just write a few lines of BASIC; who cares about &gt; MIDI! While you&apos;re at it, just forget hardware. Hardware is just &gt; going to control software from now on, right?</p><p>Well, yes, I use Csound these days.</p><p>Software controls hardware.  No change there.</p><p>&gt; So why is it that all the software is still supporting MIDI? And &gt; why is it that CCs are supported and tuning sysexes aren&apos;t? Is<br/>&gt; it really a matter of people not caring about tuning? The majority &gt; rules? We&apos;re up against the 12ET establishment and all that? I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure...</p><p>The software supports MIDI because it&apos;s the standard, and always backwards compatible.  Hence any proposal that breaks backwards compatibility is dead in the water.  CCs are supported because everybody needs them.  Tuning sysexes aren&apos;t supported because blue pixies took them away -- which is to say they are supported.</p><p>&gt; Pitch Bend exists. People use it. In Eur-Asia MIDI Pitch Bend is used &gt; for on-the-fly monophonic tuning. As early as 1983 microtonal<br/>&gt; polyphony using Pitch Bend was experimented with. A lot of &gt; software has been written to use it that way. You wrote one such &gt; program, Graham. Why? I assume because you wanted a way to make<br/>&gt; some microtonal music, and the blasted MIDI spec didn&apos;t make it so &gt; easy, so you went and wrote your own program to hack around MIDI<br/>&gt; and get the job done. And as you know, you&apos;re not the only one. And<br/>&gt; you didn&apos;t do it using sysex.</p><p>I wrote a program to use MIDI pitch bend tuning because I wanted to play with microtonality and the MIDI spec made it easy.  Nobody told me about Csound back then.  Later on I made some money and could afford hardware synthesizers with tuning tables.  That&apos;s a much better way of doing it.

Such is the imperfect world we live in.</p><p>&gt; Aaron - On the idea of the note off as a retune, another<br/>&gt; idea is to use a special RPN which switches on Note off<br/>&gt; retuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; e.g.<br/>&gt; coarse rpn 10 data 1 - changes note off to note tune</p><p>Great!

A frequency table requires too much of the<br/>hardware. Leave frequency conversion for the software that<br/>makes the tables. Hardware have global frequency settings<br/>and there are other MIDI messages to set frequency tunings<br/>for global system tuning and channel tuning, and the format<br/>is different from the MTS table format, so the frequencies in<br/>the MTS table are very confusing and in basic conflict with the<br/>MIDI spec. The format should be MIDI friendly and use MIDI<br/>logic, as shown above.</p><p>Thereafter the tuning should be done with simple messages<br/>looked up from the table, and the new message set retunes<br/>notes independently at the source level. Everything<br/>can be done using this, keeping sysex as simple as possible<br/>and keeping it to a minimum, only for tables, where large<br/>amounts of data are required.</p><p>Every MIDI device and MIDI compatible software should have<br/>at least 512 table arrays standard. Simple messages can be sent<br/>to choose the tables for each channel, and tune all the notes.<br/>The tuning messages are still needed because standard source<br/>arrays are never going to be in anything but 12 tone ET, and<br/>putting the tuning directives in the message stream means that<br/>the data will reproduce correctly on other devices that do not<br/>have the tuning table which generated the file in memory.</p><p>This idea is basically a built in TBX1 for every device, the only<br/>difference being that the retuning is not limited to 16 voices<br/>polyphony and does not use dynamic channel allocation.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Actually this looks pretty good. Then again there may<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;be something obvious I&apos;m missing here which makes the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;whole proposal useless.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll work fine as an ad hoc way of managing a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;tuning table.

They require more coding, and there are also possible<br/>&gt; problems with timing. Also, and this is the thing I have been arguing,<br/>&gt; there is a very basic problem that the simple categorical definition &gt; of sysex as a &quot;system exclusive&quot; message set makes them all sound &gt; like manufacturer specific options which do not need to be supported &gt; universally. If you really care about the single note retuning messages, you can special-case them in your MIDI parser and treat them as simple messages.

Because the new ways are simple messages, not sysex.</p><p>Redefine &quot;simple message&quot; then.  It&apos;s easier to change the language than the substance.</p><p>&gt; OK, agreed. So a needed thing would be a PDF and ASCII and HTML &gt; white paper all about this message, why it needs to be supported &gt; everywhere, and exactly how to support it. A campaign for one &gt; message, sent to every major music company on the planet, to all &gt; the developers as well as company executives. Glossy flyers. Websites. &gt; Maybe even lobbys in congresses, parliaments, etc. I&apos;m joking, but<br/>&gt; not joking. Somehow we need to get everyone to recognize one &gt; simple way of doing this and make it the standard. There is a community-agreed wish list.  It should be here:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/synthhelp.html">http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/synthhelp.html</a></p><p>but I can&apos;t reach it today.  It&apos;s been very helpful in getting soft synths supporting microtonality.  Unfortunately we haven&apos;t made any progress with hardware manufacturers. If you want to revise it in the light of these discussions we can talk about that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have this crazy idea that if a simple basic message set were offered, &gt;&gt;&gt;it would get more implementation. (insert an audience laughing here)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;What&apos;s complicated about the existing messages?<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve given my answer for that many times now.</p><p>No you haven&apos;t.  Which of the 12 bytes you have to send to retune a note is an impracticable complication?</p><p>&gt; OK. If the thing needed is a table, then this can be a sysex &gt; dump of 3 bytes per note;<br/>&gt; &gt; [sysex header]<br/>&gt; &lt;table number&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; 0nnnnnnn  0ccccccc  0fffffff (128 times)<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; [sysex stop]<br/>&gt; &gt; n = note<br/>&gt; c = coarse tuning<br/>&gt; f = fine tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; Which is exactly the format used in H-Pi stuff. &gt; This kind of table makes much more sense than<br/>&gt; a frequency table. A frequency table requires too much of the<br/>&gt; hardware. Leave frequency conversion for the software that<br/>&gt; makes the tables. Hardware have global frequency settings<br/>&gt; and there are other MIDI messages to set frequency tunings<br/>&gt; for global system tuning and channel tuning, and the format<br/>&gt; is different from the MTS table format, so the frequencies in &gt; the MTS table are very confusing and in basic conflict with the &gt; MIDI spec. The format should be MIDI friendly and use MIDI &gt; logic, as shown above.</p><p>How is it different to the MTS table format?  Because you call it 0nnnnnnn  0ccccccc  0fffffff instead of [xx yy zz] and there&apos;s no checksum?  Was that the problem all this time?</p><p>&gt; Thereafter the tuning should be done with simple messages &gt; looked up from the table, and the new message set retunes &gt; notes independently at the source level. Everything<br/>&gt; can be done using this, keeping sysex as simple as possible<br/>&gt; and keeping it to a minimum, only for tables, where large &gt; amounts of data are required. &gt; &gt; Every MIDI device and MIDI compatible software should have<br/>&gt; at least 512 table arrays standard. Simple messages can be sent &gt; to choose the tables for each channel, and tune all the notes.<br/>&gt; The tuning messages are still needed because standard source<br/>&gt; arrays are never going to be in anything but 12 tone ET, and &gt; putting the tuning directives in the message stream means that<br/>&gt; the data will reproduce correctly on other devices that do not<br/>&gt; have the tuning table which generated the file in memory.</p><p>512???  That&apos;s 512*128*3=196,608 bytes just to hold the tuning tables.  Hardware manufacturers are not going to accept that.  The MTS page already complains about 8k.</p><p>I don&apos;t get the bit about 12 tone Et.  Obviously microtonal data won&apos;t reproduce correctly on synths that don&apos;t support the relevant messages.</p><p>&gt; This idea is basically a built in TBX1 for every device, the only &gt; difference being that the retuning is not limited to 16 voices<br/>&gt; polyphony and does not use dynamic channel allocation.</p><p>The idea is basically MTS in new clothes.</p><p>&gt; Touch&iuml;&iquest;&half;, I meant hardware keyboards are controlling software<br/>&gt; synthesizers, so forget about hardware synthesizers. &lt;- (a lot<br/>&gt; of people say this but they forget that dedicated hardware has<br/>&gt; tremendous ease-of-use advantages and is not going to go &gt; away.)</p><p>We don&apos;t forget that.  We know that the hardware doesn&apos;t support what we want.  If you want to use the MIDI tuning standard you&apos;ll find it&apos;s easier to give up the advantages of hardware synthesizers and get your work done in software.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;So why is it that all the software is still supporting MIDI?

If the thing needed is a table, then this can be a sysex<br/>&gt; &gt; dump of 3 bytes per note;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [sysex header]<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;table number&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; 0nnnnnnn  0ccccccc  0fffffff (128 times)<br/>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; [sysex stop]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; n = note<br/>&gt; &gt; c = coarse tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; f = fine tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Which is exactly the format used in H-Pi stuff.<br/>&gt; &gt; This kind of table makes much more sense than<br/>&gt; &gt; a frequency table. A frequency table requires too much of the<br/>&gt; &gt; hardware. Leave frequency conversion for the software that<br/>&gt; &gt; makes the tables. Hardware have global frequency settings<br/>&gt; &gt; and there are other MIDI messages to set frequency tunings<br/>&gt; &gt; for global system tuning and channel tuning, and the format<br/>&gt; &gt; is different from the MTS table format, so the frequencies in<br/>&gt; &gt; the MTS table are very confusing and in basic conflict with the<br/>&gt; &gt; MIDI spec. The format should be MIDI friendly and use MIDI<br/>&gt; &gt; logic, as shown above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How is it different to the MTS table format?  Because you<br/>&gt; call it 0nnnnnnn  0ccccccc  0fffffff instead of [xx yy zz]<br/>&gt; and there&apos;s no checksum?  Was that the problem all this time?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The data are completely different than MTS...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Thereafter the tuning should be done with simple messages<br/>&gt; &gt; looked up from the table, and the new message set retunes<br/>&gt; &gt; notes independently at the source level. Everything<br/>&gt; &gt; can be done using this, keeping sysex as simple as possible<br/>&gt; &gt; and keeping it to a minimum, only for tables, where large<br/>&gt; &gt; amounts of data are required.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Every MIDI device and MIDI compatible software should have<br/>&gt; &gt; at least 512 table arrays standard. Simple messages can be sent<br/>&gt; &gt; to choose the tables for each channel, and tune all the notes.<br/>&gt; &gt; The tuning messages are still needed because standard source<br/>&gt; &gt; arrays are never going to be in anything but 12 tone ET, and<br/>&gt; &gt; putting the tuning directives in the message stream means that<br/>&gt; &gt; the data will reproduce correctly on other devices that do not<br/>&gt; &gt; have the tuning table which generated the file in memory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 512???  That&apos;s 512*128*3=196,608 bytes just to hold the<br/>&gt; tuning tables.  Hardware manufacturers are not going to<br/>&gt; accept that.  The MTS page already complains about 8k.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So what?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t get the bit about 12 tone Et.  Obviously microtonal<br/>&gt; data won&apos;t reproduce correctly on synths that don&apos;t support<br/>&gt; the relevant messages.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The bit about 12ET is paramount. Sample sets (still popular) can be<br/>especially constructed for microtonality, but industry standard sample-<br/>based music gear and software is never going to change from a 12ET<br/>based source set, at least not in our lifetimes. Sure, the cheapest type<br/>use the same sample over wide interval range, but the best use one<br/>sample per 12ET pitch. Maybe someday that will change to one sample<br/>per quartertone or something, but it&apos;s highly unlikely. Synthesis is a<br/>different issue, but related because it shares the field with samples.<br/>The point is that source calls should assume 12ET. Therefore tuning<br/>messages should assume 12ET. A tuning table as I outline it is totally<br/>different from an MTS table because it defines deviations from<br/>the 12ET source set, in the same way that pitch bend does this, except<br/>that the MSB and LSB define a range of + / - a quartertone to give<br/>196608ET.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This idea is basically a built in TBX1 for every device, the only<br/>&gt; &gt; difference being that the retuning is not limited to 16 voices<br/>&gt; &gt; polyphony and does not use dynamic channel allocation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea is basically MTS in new clothes.</p><p>I hope you see it isn&apos;t. The architecture is completely different. The<br/>tuning messages are always in the data stream. It&apos;s not MTS as all.<br/>It&apos;s a note-specific pitch bend for every note on every channel in the<br/>data stream. MTS doesn&apos;t have that. Tables in my outline do not obviate<br/>the need for all the note tuning messages. They would still be there in<br/>the data stream. Again, MTS doesn&apos;t do that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We know that the hardware doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; support what we want.  If you want to use the MIDI tuning<br/>&gt; standard you&apos;ll find it&apos;s easier to give up the advantages<br/>&gt; of hardware synthesizers and get your work done in software.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Fine, but that doesn&apos;t solve any of the problems being discussed. If<br/>you really feel that MTS is good enough and using the software that<br/>supports it is the way to go, that&apos;s great. I still think hardware needs<br/>to be standardized, and it should talk to the software, and it should<br/>all be simplified and made as easy as possible, and MIDI and MTS in<br/>their present forms are impeding this goal.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My TX81Z didn&apos;t cost $1300.  More like $130.  But yes, when<br/>&gt; I started working with pitch bends I didn&apos;t have that kind<br/>&gt; of money.  It&apos;s much easier for kids today because they can<br/>&gt; use Scala.  If enough people care about any of this you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; see the hardware support arriving.</p><p>Who knows, but I don&apos;t think the hardware will start arriving until<br/>everything is simplified and makes much more sense than it does<br/>now.</p><p>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=71064 href="#71064">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2007 6:12:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Andrew Hunt wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t see why a machine cares if its simple message is a &gt;&gt;special case to the standard or implemented as a system &gt;&gt;exclusive.

Simple messages can be sent &gt;&gt;&gt;to choose the tables for each channel, and tune all the notes.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;The tuning messages are still needed because standard source<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;arrays are never going to be in anything but 12 tone ET, and &gt;&gt;&gt;putting the tuning directives in the message stream means that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the data will reproduce correctly on other devices that do not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;have the tuning table which generated the file in memory.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;512???  That&apos;s 512*128*3=196,608 bytes just to hold the &gt;&gt;tuning tables.  Hardware manufacturers are not going to &gt;&gt;accept that.

Sample sets (still popular) can be &gt; especially constructed for microtonality, but industry standard sample-<br/>&gt; based music gear and software is never going to change from a 12ET &gt; based source set, at least not in our lifetimes.

Synthesis is a &gt; different issue, but related because it shares the field with samples.<br/>&gt; The point is that source calls should assume 12ET. Therefore tuning &gt; messages should assume 12ET. A tuning table as I outline it is totally &gt; different from an MTS table because it defines deviations from &gt; the 12ET source set, in the same way that pitch bend does this, except<br/>&gt; that the MSB and LSB define a range of + / - a quartertone to give &gt; 196608ET. The MTS table plainly does define deviations from the 12ET source set.  It&apos;s hardly difficult to convert from one format to the other.  The MTS format has the advantage that pitches are naturally ordered.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;This idea is basically a built in TBX1 for every device, the only &gt;&gt;&gt;difference being that the retuning is not limited to 16 voices<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;polyphony and does not use dynamic channel allocation.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The idea is basically MTS in new clothes.<br/>&gt; &gt; I hope you see it isn&apos;t.

It&apos;s muddled!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It does not say they should or should not be in Hz or cents.<br/>&gt;   It says they can be linear frequency (constant Hertz), but<br/>&gt; &quot;strongly suggests&quot; exponential frequency (constant cents).<br/>&gt;   I don&apos;t see anything unclear about that.  Stupid, in that<br/>&gt; a tuning standard doesn&apos;t strictly standardize the tuning,<br/>&gt; but perfectly clear.</p><p>Unclear in that it can&apos;t even be consistent with the language it<br/>uses, and the language it uses is unlike the language used for<br/>pitch in the rest of the MIDI spec.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s only contradictory later on in that it drops the<br/>&gt; supidity and only talks about the exponential frequency<br/>&gt; (constant cents) case.  It explicitly says the tuning is by<br/>&gt; .0061-cent steps in case you had trouble working that out.</p><p>Yes, I read it. The passage is unnecessarily obtuse.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see anything confusing or contradictory about Hz.<br/>&gt; They&apos;re a common unit of frequency.  SI standard I believe.</p><p>Sure, but Hz are not the common unit for measuring pitch in<br/>the MIDI spec.</p><p>&gt; Confusion is in the eye of the beholder.  But if anybody has<br/>&gt; trouble they can always ask here.</p><p>Yikes, that is a disconcerting thought. Fine if they want to get<br/>pounced on. Do you know how many people consciously stay<br/>away from this group?</p><p>&gt; &gt; The MTS table is basically incorrect as a MIDI addressing system<br/>&gt; &gt; because each source is always and only tuned upwards. It may be<br/>&gt; &gt; elegant to have only rising values, but it is a bad way to handle<br/>&gt; &gt; 12ET sources. The default value for each note tuning needs to be<br/>&gt; &gt; in the MIDDLE, just like Pitch Bend, so that the source always remains<br/>&gt; &gt; as near to the original data as possible, and a source should never<br/>&gt; &gt; be retuned more than a quartertone up or down. There appears to be<br/>&gt; &gt; no way to retune a source down according to MTS. The best one can<br/>&gt; &gt; hope for is that a manufacturer knows this and does not use the first<br/>&gt; &gt; byte as a NOTE number, because it is only masquerading as a Note<br/>&gt; &gt; number, and instead interprets it as is only obliquely hinted at in the<br/>&gt; &gt; text, that the first byte gives the CLOSEST MIDI Note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the manufacturer&apos;s to dumb to tune their samples the<br/>&gt; right way, does it really matter?</p><p>Blame the manufacturers again... Whether or not you think only your<br/>cat is going to notice, it&apos;s a serious issue and can be very noticable.<br/>The MTS spec should not only say something about it, but the<br/>portocol should require it to be handled properly. The first byte<br/>should be a note number (it should call it a MIDI Note like everywhere<br/>else in the MIDI spec, not the nearest semitone) and the following<br/>bytes should work like pitych bend, as I have described over and over<br/>but you keep ignoring.</p><p>&gt; Usually it&apos;s better to tune *either* sharp *or* flat,<br/>&gt; depending on the nature of the samples and interpolation<br/>&gt; algorithm.  It&apos;s trivial to do the correction to go down:<br/>&gt; add 1 to the note number and negate the tuning offset.  You<br/>&gt; don&apos;t even need a microprocessor for that.</p><p>+ / - a quartertone from center is the best. It sould be made<br/>clear in the spec.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The idea is basically MTS in new clothes.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I hope you see it isn&apos;t. The architecture is completely different. The<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tuning messages are always in the data stream. It&apos;s not MTS as all.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It&apos;s a note-specific pitch bend for every note on every channel in the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;data stream. MTS doesn&apos;t have that. Tables in my outline do not obviate<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the need for all the note tuning messages. They would still be there in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the data stream. Again, MTS doesn&apos;t do that.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;It don&apos;t see the difference.  MTS does have what you want.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Does does does.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, it doesn&apos;t. The difference should be as plain as day!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (1) No sysex<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What we&apos;re talking about here does use sysex.  Follow the<br/>&gt; thread back.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (2) Every Note TUNED independently by simple messages only<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MTS can tune each note independently by 12 byte messages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (3) All source calls + / - a quartertone from 12ET in 196608ET<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Compared to up to a semitone, now that you&apos;ve defined that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (4) No tables required<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What we&apos;re talking about here does use tables.  Follow the<br/>&gt; thread back.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (5) If tables are used, they are transparent, so the data stream<br/>&gt; &gt; still contains all the tuning messages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In what way does the data stream not contain the MTS messages?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How is that the same as MTS? MTS provides none of that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s all the same.  Except for the bit about quartertones.<br/>&gt; And a checksum, I think.  To me that&apos;s clothing.</p><p>Please follow the thread back yourself and you will see that<br/>I have been talking about a different (and I believe better) way to<br/>do things, as I stated above in plain language and have stated<br/>many times by now.</p><p>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=71082 href="#71082">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2007 1:02:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The MTS table is basically incorrect as a MIDI addressing system<br/>&gt; because each source is always and only tuned upwards.</p><p>Eh?

So it is no longer happening.</p><p>According to the Microsoft help for MidiOutLongMsg, whether it happens synchronously or asynchronously depends on the device driver:<br/> <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms711629.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms711629.aspx</a><br/>&quot;The MIDI output device driver determines whether the data is sent synchronously or asynchronously.&quot;</p><p>If sent asynchronously, then the receiving program would be told (by return value of midiOutUnprepareHeader) that it is okay to continue,  while the device driver continues to send the sysex - and then the concern is that if your  program is permitted to continue sending midi messages while the device driver sends on the sysex in the background, and you then send a short message to the device driver before it has finished sending the long sysex message, it may reasonably enough interpolate it into the stream before the original sysex has been completely sent. All depends on how the device driver is written, but seems from the Microsoft help that it is at least permitted to write one like that.</p><p>I&apos;m not totally sure that this was the problem, just suspected it at the time. I may be wrong about that, and whatever it was, it may now be fixed.</p><p>Google search for asynchronous sysex brings up posts that suggests it may possibly be a possibility on other OSs as well, if I understand the posts correctly (not sure I do).<br/><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-39,GGLJ:en&q=asynchronous+sysex">http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-39,GGLJ:en&q=asynchronous+sysex</a></p><p>Yes I know you have to keep track of the state of the active rpn. That&apos;s a bit extra code yes but hardly anything compared with the extra work to process MIM_LONGDATA and to set up all the sysex handling code in Windows. If one processes any of the other rpns already then you have already coded for that.</p><p>In Windows XP it is hard to find a virtual midi cable to relay sysexes from one software progr. to another if you want  to use Giga (which is incompatible with Midi Yoke Junction NT) - you can&apos;t use Maple virtual cable - but can use LoopBe1.</p><p>The point about the number of notes you can retune was to do with the timing issues. If the timing order is preserverd it is no problem. But if you need to retune notes well in advance, and can&apos;t predict when a particular pitch may be required, then you are limited to a table of 128 notes you can retune right away before any notes are played at all - if user suddenly plays a note not in the table so far, you need to be able to add a new pitch to the table instantly - and can&apos;t do that with MTS sysexes if it is possible the sysex could be delayed in transmission to after the note on.</p><p>NRPNs are supposed to be hardware or application specific, and you risk the possibility that they may already be defined to mean something else on the user&apos;s equipment.</p><p>Better support of MTS sysexes, and requiring that all drivers keep the timing order of the sysexes and note Ons would do as well from programming point of view as the RPN apart from the issue that there is also rather more involved in the code for sending and receiving sysexes than is needed for sending and receiving rpns. In the early days of FTS I could have added support for RPN tuning much more quickly than adding support for sysexes and that would surely be the case for anyone who is in the early days of programming a midi app. for Windows.</p><p>Perhaps the timing issue isn&apos;t a problem nowadays, and I may be wrong that it ever was, on Windows - unless someone else comes up with an example of the sysexes getting transmitting out of seq. with the note ons. The help for MidiOutLongMsg seems to suggest it is acceptable for a driver to relay the sysexes it receives asynchronously - well I expect it is not really in a separate stream, but interpolated as fragments into the current midi stream. But I may be misreading that as well.

But I wouldn&apos;t bet money on this working.  I wouldn&apos;t expect a 12 byte message to be interrupted but, again, if my life depended on it I&apos;d certainly be careful ;)</p><p>&gt; Google search for asynchronous sysex brings up posts that<br/>&gt; suggests it may possibly be a possibility on other OSs as<br/>&gt; well, if I understand the posts correctly (not sure I do). I&apos;ll check your link to see if it gives different results to mine.  I remember some things about OSX.  But it said only non-channel data could be sent during sysexes.  So that definitely doesn&apos;t affect us.  Otherwise there were hits for draft protocols.  UNIX machines usually give you MIDI as a stream of bytes so you know the order, but have to parse it yourself.</p><p>I did check PortMidi as well.  This is the best cross-platform MIDI library I know of (and I&apos;m afraid still not quite there).  This is the only documentation:</p><p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/portmusic/portmidi/portmidi.h">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/portmusic/portmidi/portmidi.h</a></p><p>It says sysexes are delivered as chunks of short messages, similar to the USB protocol.</p><p>&gt; Yes I know you have to keep track of the state of the<br/>&gt; active rpn. That&apos;s a bit extra code yes but hardly anything<br/>&gt; compared with the extra work to process MIM_LONGDATA and to<br/>&gt; set up all the sysex handling code in Windows. If one<br/>&gt; processes any of the other rpns already then you have already<br/>&gt; coded for that.</p><p>So let&apos;s be clear that this is a problem with the Windows API, not the MIDI standard.</p><p>&gt; In Windows XP it is hard to find a virtual midi cable to<br/>&gt; relay sysexes from one software progr. to another if you<br/>&gt; want  to use Giga (which is incompatible with Midi Yoke<br/>&gt; Junction NT) - you can&apos;t use Maple virtual cable - but<br/>&gt; can use LoopBe1.</p><p>I never got virtual cables working in XP.  I don&apos;t blame the MMA.</p><p>&gt; The point about the number of notes you can retune was to<br/>&gt; do with the timing issues. If the timing order is preserverd<br/>&gt; it is no problem. But if you need to retune notes well in<br/>&gt; advance, and can&apos;t predict when a particular pitch may be<br/>&gt; required, then you are limited to a table of 128 notes you<br/>&gt; can retune right away before any notes are played at all -<br/>&gt; if user suddenly plays a note not in the table so far, you<br/>&gt; need to be able to add a new pitch to the table instantly -<br/>&gt; and can&apos;t do that with MTS sysexes if it is possible the<br/>&gt; sysex could be delayed in transmission to after the note on.</p><p>If the MTS is followed correctly it should still work.  The synthesizer will receive the tuning message right after the note-on and do a glitch-free retuning.  This will happen too fast for the listener to notice the old pitch.</p><p>                     Graham</p><p>&gt; &gt; NRPNs are supposed to be hardware or application specific, and you risk the possibility that they may already be defined to mean something else on the user&apos;s equipment.<br/>&gt; &gt; Better support of MTS sysexes, and requiring that all drivers keep the timing order of the sysexes and note Ons would do as well from programming point of view as the RPN apart from the issue that there is also rather more involved in the code for sending and receiving sysexes than is needed for sending and receiving rpns. In the early days of FTS I could have added support for RPN tuning much more quickly than adding support for sysexes and that would surely be the case for anyone who is in the early days of programming a midi app. for Windows.<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps the timing issue isn&apos;t a problem nowadays, and I may be wrong that it ever was, on Windows - unless someone else comes up with an example of the sysexes getting transmitting out of seq. with the note ons. The help for MidiOutLongMsg seems to suggest it is acceptable for a driver to relay the sysexes it receives asynchronously - well I expect it is not really in a separate stream, but interpolated as fragments into the current midi stream. But I may be misreading that as well. If anyone knows more I&apos;m interested to hear about it.<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; &gt; Robert</p></div><h3><a id=71101 href="#71101">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/2007 6:47:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi Graham and Aaron,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;As I see it, the advantages of rpn or note off -&gt; note tune over MTS &gt; &gt; would be:<br/>&gt; &gt; 3.

If you&apos;ve never seen an obtuse standard<br/>&gt; before you&apos;ve lived a charmed life.</p><p>The rest of the MIDI spec is not so obtuse as this.</p><p>&gt; MTS is the MIDI Tuning Specification.  MIDI is the Musical<br/>&gt; Instrument Digital Interface.  Hence MTS is a specification<br/>&gt; for tuning in an interface for digital musical instruments.<br/>&gt;   It isn&apos;t supposed to be an advice sheet on the<br/>&gt; implementation of digital musical instruments.  I don&apos;t see<br/>&gt; that it has any business telling manufacturers how to handle<br/>&gt; the messages, only stating what the messages mean.</p><p>Yes, it should state exactly what the message means, and it<br/>should state it in language which is consistent with the rest of<br/>the spec. So what does the first byte of the MTS table sysex<br/>mean? Is it a MIDI Note? No. But it&apos;s a &quot;note&quot;. It&apos;s a &quot;semitone&quot;.<br/>It&apos;s &quot;the nearest semitone&quot;. This is not MIDI-speak. If it is<br/>anything to do with a &quot;note&quot; in MIDI, then it&apos;s a MIDI Note, and<br/>the data should give a MIDI Note number. But it doesn&apos;t directly<br/>specify a MIDI Note number. It&apos;s left to the manufacturer to<br/>figure out which MIDI Note number is meant by a byte which<br/>could so easily otherwise give a MIDI Note number directly.<br/>That&apos;s just silly and anti-MIDI.</p><p>&gt; &gt; + / - a quartertone from center is the best. It sould be made<br/>&gt; &gt; clear in the spec.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reference?  I remember the Csound book saying it&apos;s better to<br/>&gt; always sharpen samples these days.  RAM is cheaper than<br/>&gt; processor overhead so you interpolate the sample to the<br/>&gt; lowest note you need.

As English is my job<br/>&gt; I&apos;d certainly be interested in how I&apos;m supposed to interpret<br/>&gt; this passage so as not to involve sysexes or tables.  Until<br/>&gt; then I stand by my comment that it&apos;s very similar to the MTS.</p><p>It&apos;s a strange opinion if you acknowledge the rest of what I<br/>have been attempting to say in plain English. I gave you a tuning<br/>table saying &quot;here it is if you have to have one&quot;. It uses sysex,<br/>yes. It is a table, yes. I gave you a table because you seemed to<br/>want one. So, sure, there is a table, and the most logical way to<br/>send a table is through sysex. You choose to ignore the fact that I<br/>said before that and after it and all around it, from the beginning<br/>of this thread, that tables and sysex should never be required to<br/>accomplish tunings. I explained more than once that if a table<br/>is used, it should be transparent, meaning all the tuning messages<br/>for every note still get put into the data stream. I even outlined<br/>point by point in the last post the differences between what I&apos;m<br/>proposing and what is MTS. You keep coming back to tell me it&apos;s<br/>just like MTS and MTS does what I want anyway. Well, it&apos;s not and it<br/>doesn&apos;t.

Some devices support the device<br/>global and channel tuning RPNs, which may alter the frequency data of any<br/>MTS messages.</p><p>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=71134 href="#71134">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2007 11:28:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Are you under some delusion that Graham and I are very different?</p><p>You are actually quite different in some important aspects, and it is<br/>too bad you can&apos;t see that.</p><p>&gt; And do you have a comment to make which is remotely relevant to the<br/>topic?</p><p>No, just to behavior, which I have.</p></div><h3><a id=71137 href="#71137">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2007 1:21:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you under some delusion that Graham and I are very different?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are actually quite different in some important aspects, and it is<br/>&gt; too bad you can&apos;t see that.</p><p>Graham may be a tad crankier than I am, but not<br/>not by much.

Is that practical?</p><p>Yes that&apos;s practical.</p><p>Main Disadvantage: If you tune notes one at a time then tuning tables tend to get rather scrambled eventually - e.g. pitches don&apos;t increase always as the note number increases.</p><p>Each time you have to  find a free note number to tune to the desired pitch (since with MTS any midi note number can be tuned to any pitch). You can always do that of course if you have no more than 128 distinct pitches sounding at once - but after doing this for some time, maybe the number you would like to use is already taken up by a note currently in play. So in a demanding tuning situation, after a good many tunings like that you can end up with a very scrambled up tuning table.</p><p>That&apos;s no problem for the sending program. It is easy enough in software to keep track of which Midi note number needs to be sent for which desired pitch on the output synth. Also it is no problem for a user who plays keyboard tuned by the sending program. But it can be confusing for anyone who tries to play notes on the receiving synth directly.</p><p>The main advantage of doing a single big tuning table all at once is that you can tune the receiving device in a more intuitive way - e.g. that as the note numbers increase, the pitch increases.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=71142 href="#71142">ðŸ”—</a>paolovalladolid &#x3C;phv40@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2007 5:56:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paolovalladolid wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; MIDI Notes = 12ET<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Manuel gets pissed when I say stuff like that.
