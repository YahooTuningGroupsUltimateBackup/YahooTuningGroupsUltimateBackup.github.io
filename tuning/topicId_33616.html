I still don&apos;t get it. Why?</p><p>****Why?  Because that&apos;s what hoards of players in conservatories and<br/>music schools have studied and are *used* to.  And, I believe that&apos;s<br/>what they are going to study for the conceivable future.  I haven&apos;t<br/>heard of any schools, except for isolated cases at the New England<br/>Conservatory, to offer anything different. &gt;&gt;</p><p>    Umm, excuse me, but at Vanderbilt&apos;s Blair School of Music there are quite<br/>a few well-tempered pianos in use. Not only are many of the instructors&apos;<br/>instruments tuned in non-ET, but the practise wing has four rooms in a row<br/>with a Werkmeister, Young, Victorian  and ET tunings on them and the students<br/>certainly are becoming familiar with alternatives.<br/>    This is happening at more than a few schools, however, the heavyweights<br/>of musical academia are going to move more slowly than those of us out there<br/>that are still in the experimental mode.  Their calcified philosophy won&apos;t<br/>let them open up very fast to the fact that there is more than one way to<br/>tune a piano.

However, I guess the question<br/>is whether you would differentiate any of these tunings on a<br/>*score...* or if they&apos;re all just written the same on the staff.  If<br/>they *are* written the same, then how do we know, just by the *score*<br/>which tuning is used?  I guess the tuning would have to be indicated<br/>at the top of the score, or some such....</p><p>JP</p></div>
