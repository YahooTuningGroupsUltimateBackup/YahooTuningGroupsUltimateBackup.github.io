If Margo is to be believed, there was a fairly wide understanding<br/>of meantone temperament extended to as many as 19 tones in Gesualdo&apos;s time<br/>and locale. The &quot;quartertone&quot; or &quot;fifthtone&quot; between any &quot;enharmonic&quot; pair<br/>such as C and B# was fairly well understood in this milieu.

Since I have had excellent results with drifting in Binchois,<br/>Palestrina, and Gesualdo, I see no reason to accept your particular<br/>disapproval.  In professional experiences with singers there is no handicap<br/>to drift when it provides pure harmonies consistently.</p><p>Now, it would be nice if people had the abilities you want to register for<br/>them, ability to memorize complex tempered relationships on an archicembalo<br/>or related extra-keyed instrument, and the ability to recall and keep to the<br/>exact pitch heights.  The musical sense does not have the grasp you attribute<br/>to it.  The ease of providing pure harmonies independent of meantone theory<br/>makes much more musical and practical sense to me for Gesualdo than any other<br/>put forward.  Clearly we each have areas of expertise that are greater than<br/>others and this may be a blind spot for either of us.</p><p>Maybe it is time to answer Kraig&apos;s question, are there any a cappella<br/>recordings in strict meantone?  I suspect not.  Yes, I did indeed read<br/>Margo&apos;s post.  I think that for music that is tied to a keyboard, at least in<br/>conception, meantone is a likely possibility.  Certainly in the Baroque<br/>period it was.  However, for Gesualdo, his music would have to be in<br/>something fairly obvious, or he would have need to leave special instructions<br/>for doing his music, if you get my drift.  Remember also that they left part<br/>books and not scores from the Renaissance period.  This may make for a more<br/>analog approach to the music, and less constrained by a keyboard compass<br/>which was not present in performance.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=19214 href="#19214">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/21/2001 5:57:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19085.html#19212">/tuning/topicId_19085.html#19212</a></p><p> However, for Gesualdo, his music would have to be in<br/>&gt; something fairly obvious, or he would have need to leave special<br/>instructions  for doing his music, if you get my drift.</p><p>That&apos;s pretty funny, Johnny!
