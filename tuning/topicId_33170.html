That&apos;s a loop, which you&apos;ve decided to treat as a circle -- a<br/>nice bicycle chain, also, which you can ride about town musically<br/>while others debate it&apos;s not quite circular geometry.</p><p>In this 53-note loop, the last fifth is about 3.62 cents narrower than<br/>the others (all pure), and a neat consequence is that you get two<br/>slightly different &quot;flavors&quot; intervals separated by this amount in<br/>their sizes, especially notable for certain intervals with chains<br/>including large numbers of fifths.</p><p>For example, in a complete 53-note loop, you get small semitones at<br/>both 66.76 cents (the usual 90.22-cent semitone less a 23.46-cent<br/>Pythagorean comma) and 70.38 cents (precisely three of those commas).</p><p>In 53-EDO, you&apos;d get one semitone of around this &quot;thirdtone&quot; size,<br/>sort of splitting the difference between the two Pythagorean sizes.</p><p>With an EDO circle, the closure is defined mathematically. With a<br/>loop, it&apos;s a matter of choice: does this look like a good place to<br/>&quot;call it a day,&quot; tune a pure octave (if this is a 2:1 octave tuning),<br/>and treat the resulting set as a musical &quot;circle&quot;?</p><p>A 53-note Pythagorean loop, treated as a complete system, seems to me<br/>just as much a &quot;tuning circle&quot; or &quot;bicycle chain&quot; as an unequal<br/>well-temperament (for example, Paul Erlich&apos;s 22-note unequal system).<br/>The circle does in effect close, but not quite &quot;equally&quot;: one fifth is<br/>a different size than those others -- or, in a typical<br/>well-temperament, we have two or more sets or groups of unequally<br/>sized fifths.</p><p>One way to explain this is that in a 53-Pythagorean loop, one fifth is<br/>3.62 cents narrower than the rest; in 53-EDO, this 3.62 cents gets<br/>equally distributed to every fifth. Either way, it adds up: we have a<br/>bicycle chain, or circle. However, with 53-EDO, the circle closes<br/>itself; with a Pythagorean loop, we close it by tuning that pure<br/>octave and &quot;virtually tempering&quot; that 53rd odd fifth.</p><p>The term &quot;loop&quot; appeals to me because maybe it suggests this element<br/>of choice. Similarly, a 31-meantone loop (1/4-comma), or a 46-loop<br/>(the equivalent of a meantone for just 14:11 thirds), is musically<br/>very close to 31-EDO or 46-EDO: the mathematics of the loop permit us,<br/>but do not require us (as with an EDO) to &quot;call it a circle.&quot;</p><p>Now for the question of those schismic thirds, early 15th-century<br/>Pythagorean tunings, and the like.</p><p>First of all, as people have noted, you can get near-5-limit thirds in<br/>either Pythagorean or 53-EDO, not surprising since these two tunings<br/>are so _close_ to being identical. The basic spellings and mappings<br/>are the same.</p><p>One point about known early 15th-century tunings: the near-5-limit or<br/>&quot;schisma&quot; thirds are generally those involving written sharps, for<br/>example A-C#, E-G#, and D-F# tuned as A-Db, E-Ab, and D-Gb. The<br/>diatonic notes are tuned in a usual Pythagorean fashion, so that we<br/>get C-E (a usual Pythagorean third) rather than C-Fb.</p><p>In the late 15th-century however, a _theoretical_ scheme like that of<br/>Bartoleme Ramos for a 5-limit monochord could be interpreted as a<br/>slight modification of some more thorough &quot;skhismic&quot; tuning (to use<br/>the Helmholtz-Ellis spelling) where regular thirds involving the usual<br/>_musica recta_ notes or basic gamut (Bb-B) are also of this type. By<br/>this point, Ramos himself seems to describe a practical keyboard in<br/>some kind of meantone, avoiding the &quot;Wolf&quot; interval among the musica<br/>recta notes that such a skhismic temperament would involve in a simple<br/>12-note scheme. In a Gb-B tuning of the early 15th-century variety, we<br/>have the Wolf at B-Gb, or written B-F# -- sometimes an issue, but a<br/>lot less often than something like A-Fb (written A-E) would be in the<br/>C-Fb scenario on a 12-note keyboard.</p><p>Anyway, Pythagorean has lots of neat thirds and other intervals to<br/>offer. We can get intervals about 3.80 cents from pure ratios of 7<br/>(9:7, 7:6, 7:4), and various kinds of neutral or semineutral thirds,<br/>for example.</p><p>The same remarks mostly apply to 53-EDO, where the 5-limit thirds are<br/>a bit more accurate, and the 7-flavor (2-3-7-9) thirds a bit less so.<br/>Here are some pairings:</p><p>        18/53        13/53      Pythagorean type (~81:64, ~32:27)<br/>        19/53        12/53      7-flavor type (~9:7, ~7:6)<br/>        17/53        14/53      5-limit/schismic type (~5:4, ~6:5)<br/>        16/53        15/53      &quot;Semineutral&quot; type (~69:56, ~28:23)<br/>        20/53        11/53      &quot;Ultra-Gothic&quot; type (~13:10, ~15:13)</p><p>That&apos;s five very useful flavors of thirds, and in a 53-note<br/>Pythagorean loop, we&apos;d get variations of 3.62 cents in these size<br/>categories when we looked at the whole cycle, a touch distinguishing<br/>the two tunings.</p><p>Anyway, I hope that the &quot;loop&quot; can maybe provide a third alternative<br/>in the &quot;circle vs. chain&quot; discussion: a loop is a chain that you<br/>choose to make into a circle by permitting an odd fifth closing the<br/>octave to be a bit unequal. With a loop, it&apos;s by choice; with an EDO<br/>circle, it&apos;s by definition.</p><p>Most appreciatively, and happy composing,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2002 10:07:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

It&apos;s nice to know,<br/>too, that *most* of the tuning is truly 3-limit Pythagorean and, it<br/>seems, more &quot;authentic&quot; for Medieval performance practice, which is<br/>most probably why you like it as well...</p><p>The term &quot;loop&quot; sounds very much like &quot;Lupus&quot; which is, of course,<br/>the *wolf* in Latin and astronomical constellations.
