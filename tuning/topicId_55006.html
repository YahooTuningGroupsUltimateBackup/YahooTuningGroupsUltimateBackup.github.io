While continuing to be guided by intuition and aesthetics, we need to learn more about objectivity in theoretical approach to Indian music. Through this Group, I am gleaning not only more information, but also the methodology of new ways of approach. The Group members are very helpful whenever I have queries (which I have -- very often).</p><p>I appreciate your kind offer. I want to assure you that I will use the copy strictly for my personal study.</p><p>I am a professional musician. I live in the U.S.</p><p>I request you to visit my web site<br/><a href="http://www.SoundOfIndia.com">http://www.SoundOfIndia.com</a></p><p>From there we can take care of the remaining details.
