Sometimes<br/>during peak hours, I will get the &quot;Page Cannot Be Displayed&quot; error<br/>when I try to post, and about 50% of the time when this happens, the<br/>mail doesn&apos;t go through to the list. Gee Thanks Yahoo!</p><p>I got to hear Joseph Pehrson&apos;s new piece &quot;Beepy&quot;, in the Bohlen-<br/>Pierce scale today, which gets the <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> &quot;Pick of the Day Award&quot;<br/>(from me! : ) ).</p><p>It&apos;s really great to hear one of our list members write a good<br/>composition in the BP scale, and I really dig Joseph&apos;s melodic<br/>approach to this (as well as anything I hear). It&apos;s a nifty<br/>electronic piece, which has a really nice &quot;live played&quot; feel to it.<br/>Who needs quantizing anyhow!</p><p>I liked the rhythms on this too! A really nice multi-timbral piece,<br/>with depth. This really makes me want to compose something with this<br/>too in the future. I&apos;ve did some improvising with it, and it has some<br/>very unique properties and possibilities.</p><p>Check it out:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html</a></p><p>Did you do this with Digital Orchestrator?</p><p>Thanks, and keep that microtonal music flowing in large amounts,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
