He used techniques reminiscent of both the<br/>Mongolian and Thibetan styles of harmonic singing and his cello work in<br/>combination with it was remarkably reminiscent of Harry Partch (who<br/>lived with Jonathan&apos;s family during J.G.&apos;s childhood).</p><p>The next piece was more harmonic singing, with an adapted autoharp tuned<br/>to the harmonic series.</p><p>Then, he switched to the TS-10 microtonal synthesizer and played a piece<br/>that started in 19 tone equal temperament and gradually transferred to<br/>Carlos Beta tuning. Jeff Stayton accompanied him on OM Bass (Jeff&apos;s<br/>version of Ivor&apos;s Megalyra).</p><p>Elizabeth Glasier then began an exotic 7 beat ostinato on roto-toms,<br/>while Jonathan improvised in 19tet with a xylophone voice on the TS-10.</p><p>Next, Elizabeth switched to the Percussion Bush and the Godzilla (it<br/>sounds like the  famous monster singing), while Jonathan played the<br/>Xoaxacan Flute and then switched to the Wing (a bowed percussion<br/>instrument whose sound cannot be described).</p><p>Set 2 included a duet with Marcello on Cello and Hans Fjellest on the<br/>sazy ( a turkish lute, used in Greek music), another duet with Able<br/>Ashes on guitar and Sam Lopez on Electric Bass, A solo by Jonathan on a<br/>set of 17 Thibetan Bells, and a final duet with Elizabeth playing 19<br/>tone Marimba and Jonathan beginning on Shakuhachi and finishing on 19<br/>tone guitar.</p><p>It was a memorable event for improvised microtonal performance!</p><p>Best to all,</p><p>Denny Genovese</p></div>
