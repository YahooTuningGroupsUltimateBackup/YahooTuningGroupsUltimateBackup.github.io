Although the piece is diatonic, it was<br/>not composed in 12 and then ported over to 15. It was written completely in 15, listening<br/>to how 15 sounded and what 15 could do, and there are many passages which are unique<br/>to 15, which simply do not work in 12.</p><p>I was attempting to use the &quot;good&quot; diatonic intervals of 15ET to write a piece in a standard<br/>form which would also give an example of some of the unique possibilities of 15. The<br/>subject statements and cadences work in 12, but the episodes do not.</p><p>It could be that stylistically this piece is a bit at odds with the tuning. It was an<br/>experiment; only the second piece in 15 I have tried to compose, and maybe not the most<br/>effective, but there will probably be others that I hope may be more successful : )</p><p>I do think it&apos;s a good enough work to stand multiple listenings, and the dissonant and odd<br/>effects of 15 should be lessened with repetition.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Hunt</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; New piece written this weekend and posted as a MIDI file here:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Fugue a3 in 15ET&quot; is my third composition using TBX1 with a<br/>&gt; &gt; standard MIDI keyboard (this time a KORG 01/w 61 key) and<br/>&gt; &gt; notation software (Overture for Mac OSX).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The subject emphasizes the good halfsteps, thirds and sevenths<br/>&gt; &gt; of 15ET.

Well, for a site like that to work for music, you&apos;d need some audio equivalent of a thumbnail -- maybe a 5-second representative clip from the music. Then the main page for each category could loop through the thumbnails of the most recent 5 or so uploads.</p><p>A key feature of sites like DeviantArt is the ability to browse through a list of an artist&apos;s favorite works from other artists and follow the links. There are sites that almost have the right features -- like SoundClick or Zebox, but you have to go out of your way to find them. With a specialized interest like tuning, there needs to be a simple way to find the music of interest among the flood of 12-ET music.</p><p>Prent Rodgers&apos; page on SoundClick has managed to attract a handful of comments. If it wasn&apos;t for the annoying features, SoundClick might be a good model to look at for ideas.</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/pro/view/01/default.cfm?BandID=104802">http://www.soundclick.com/pro/view/01/default.cfm?BandID=104802</a></p><p>But the trick will how be to encourage comments on specific elements of composition. I don&apos;t know what would work for that -- just coming up with wild ideas -- but maybe when submitting a piece of music you could check off items from a list of featured elements (e.g.: microtonality, orchestration, rhythm). That could be another way to find similar pieces for comparison.</p></div>
