Plot impulses at w=c+m, c+2m,<br/>c+3m, etc... and w=c-m, c-2m, c-3m, etc...<br/>4) The amplitude of each impulse is related to the Bessel functions of<br/>the nth kind: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function</a></p><p>I don&apos;t remember the exact formula for the amplitude, but you can<br/>probably find it pretty easily by googling &quot;fm bessel function.&quot; The<br/>general idea, though is that an infinite series sidebands are<br/>generated at spacing m around carrier c. Negative frequencies reflect<br/>into the positive side of the spectrum, but with altered phase (I<br/>think altered by 90 degrees, not sure).</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
