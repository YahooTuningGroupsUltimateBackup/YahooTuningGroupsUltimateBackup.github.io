It is simply inevitable.<br/>The truly path-breaking step can never be predicted,<br/>and certainly not by the person who makes it at the<br/>time he makes it. He clears as he goes, evolves his<br/>own techniques, devises his own tools, ignores where<br/>he must. And his path cannot be retraced, because<br/>each of us is an original being.&quot;</p><p>Genesis of a Music (2nd edition: 1974), preface to<br/>the 2nd edition, page xi</p><p>--<br/>Bill Flavell</p></div>
