Every interval<br/>&gt;is 7-odd-limit consonant except the 21/16, which is so close to 4/3 as to<br/>&gt;be quite dissonant, giving this chord the melancholy sound common to all<br/>&gt;crunchy chords.</p><p>I like this chord quite a bit.  I used to play it on instruments tuned to<br/>the 12-of-harmonics-16-through-32 scale (after Denny Genovese and Wendy<br/>Carlos), treating it as a suspended chord.</p><p>&gt;1/1:9/8:7/6:3/2:7/4 is also very crunchy because every interval is<br/>&gt;9-odd-limit consonant except the 28/27, a very narrow interval of 63 cents<br/>&gt;or a thirdtone. This chord is recognizable in 12-eq as min7(9), but just<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t have the same bite.</p><p>Well said.  This sonority can be heard in various places on Michael<br/>Harrison&apos;s excellent _From Ancient Worlds_.</p><p>Another example is 1/1 6/5 3/2 7/4 (whose only dissonance is the 35:24).<br/>It can make a nice microtonal passing chord between 1/1 6/5 3/2 9/5 and<br/>1/1 7/6 3/2 7/4.</p><p>Just some of the interesting stuff going on in strict JI -- no temperament<br/>necessary.  In fact, as Keenan pointed out, some of this stuff is lost on<br/>the smaller temperaments (the first example is a no-go even in 22-equal).</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
