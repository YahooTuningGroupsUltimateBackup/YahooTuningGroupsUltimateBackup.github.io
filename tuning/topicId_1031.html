I would say that under most circumstances, most 12-ET intervals<br/>&gt;&gt;require relatively low number ratio approximations: the minor third is<br/>&gt;&gt;6:5, the major third is 5:4, the perfect fourth is 4:3, their<br/>inversions<br/>&gt;&gt;similarly, and the tritone is quite often 7:5 or 10:7.</p><p>Dante wrote,</p><p>&gt;Surely it is easy to hear 5/4 and 400c as two different intervals.</p><p>Of course!</p><p>&gt;&gt;400c is<br/>closely approximated by 635/504 (399.99943c). This is a 127 limit(!)<br/>ratio.</p><p>It&apos;s also approximated by tons of other ratios that are too complex to<br/>make out as having any JI character. What I was saying is that the<br/>character of 400 cents is more influenced by 5:4 than by any other ratio<br/>(9:7 is important in some contexts).</p><p>&gt;Within a tonal context, we do read 400c as 5/4, but 400c still has a<br/>sound<br/>&gt;of its own. Weather that sound fits within any discernable musical<br/>system<br/>&gt;&gt;as&lt; itself is another question. I doubt if it could to any human ears<br/>(at<br/>&gt;least at this stage of our aural evolution. Who knows what the next few<br/>&gt;thousand years may bring!)</p><p>Evolution happens because of survival of the fittest. What kind of<br/>eugenics program do you forsee that will wipe out those with poor aural<br/>resolution? (Sorry, didn&apos;t mean to get smart, I just hate these kinds of<br/>statements.)</p><p>&gt;But I would say that anyone who argues for an<br/>&gt;independent function for et intervals (as opposed to their being read<br/>by<br/>&gt;our ears as low number ratios) would have to answer this.</p><p>I say most of them are read as low number ratios. Does that mean I don&apos;t<br/>have to answer? (Again, sorry if I sound rude, but I&apos;m really concerned<br/>I&apos;m not getting the jist of your arguments here.)</p><p>Dante wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;so the question of perception<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;of ET intervals can be considered as identical with that of the<br/>&gt;&gt;perception<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;of higher number ratios.</p><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;Yes, both will tend to be heard in terms of simpler ratios (this is<br/>&gt;&gt;quite related to my last post!).</p><p>Dante wrote,</p><p>&gt;I think this has alot to do with context. To my ear, gamelan scales do<br/>not<br/>&gt;sound like mistuned low integer ratios.</p><p>Well, ignoring the very important fact of the inharmonic partials of<br/>most gamelan instruments, you have to admit that gamelan intervals can<br/>be approximated just as well as ET intervals, or any other non-just<br/>intervals, by higher number ratios. That must have some bearing on what<br/>you were claiming above about the questions of perception being<br/>identical. Are you now saying they&apos;re not identical? (Once again, I<br/>apologize if I seem like I&apos;m being unnecessarily argumentative. But to<br/>be honest, I got the sense that your last post, which was a reply to me,<br/>had elements of changing the terms of the discussion to gain some sort<br/>of advantage. I had to defend myself, but if I totally misread you, I<br/>sincerely apologize.)</p></div>
