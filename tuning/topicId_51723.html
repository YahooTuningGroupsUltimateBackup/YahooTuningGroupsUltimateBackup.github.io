Murray Schafer in the<br/>Papua New Guinea Rainforest</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Author: Steven Feld<br/>Source: The Soundscape Newsletter, Number 08., June, 1994<br/>What role can an anthropological voice have in this large mix we&apos;re calling<br/>acoustic ecology and soundscape studies? How is this voice complementary to,<br/>yet distinct from, voices from history, acoustics, performance, design,<br/>psychology, geography, musicology, composition, architecture, philosophy, or<br/>communications? One way to answer is with the simple observation that anthropologists<br/>tend toward the Kantian view that all knowledge begins in experience. We jump<br/>off that cliff to study how human experiential patterns and practices construct<br/>the habits, systems of belief, knowledge, and action we call culture. And we<br/>study it everywhere and anywhere we can. Our ultimate concern is with people,<br/>with adequately and evocatively representing their experiential worlds, their<br/>voices, their humanity. To take up that concern the anthropological project<br/>basically must ask, what could it possibly be like to be - to feel, sense,<br/>imagine, act, become - another kind of person? A full answer, of course, is an<br/>impossibility. We cannot become another. But the challenge of getting close or at<br/>least closer, of glimpsing, hearing, touching other realities, is thoroughly<br/>compelling to us. Another way to say it is that what turns us on is human<br/>complexity and diversity, and we celebrate and document it all, from beauty and<br/>hope to horror and despair. In fact we tend to do this in far more detail and<br/>with far more obsession than the general public cares to know about. We justify<br/>what others perceive as our excess by claiming, simply, that there is too much<br/>we don&apos;t know about the sources and varieties of human difference. But deep<br/>down we hope that by writing and circulating other peoples&apos; histories, by giving<br/>their voices places to speak and shout and sing from, we in some measure<br/>combat and counter the longstanding arrogance of colonial and imperial authority,<br/>of history written in one language, in one voice, as one narrative.<br/>Let me now position myself a bit more in this story. In the intense climate<br/>of race and war politics of the late 1960&apos;s I found myself moving from being a<br/>musician to wanting to be an anthropologist. I soon found out that there was a<br/>kind of hybrid field, an anthropology of music; its practitioners called<br/>themselves ethnomusicologists. I took up the study of this field of<br/>ethnomusicology in earnest in graduate school, only to find, disappointedly, that a great<br/>deal of it mimicked the study of western art musics, replacing western history<br/>with a remote ahistorical exotic. Ethnomusicology often seemed very much about<br/>doing to presumed &quot;others&quot; what had already been done to a presumed &quot;us&quot;. So,<br/>for example, it replaced periods of western music history with areal regions<br/>of geographically defined others. It presumed western music theory could<br/>translate and definitively explain other musical materials and concepts. It focused<br/>on reified categories and things, like pieces, instruments, texts, and<br/>composers, and otherwise took music as a universal given. It valued the same things<br/>elsewhere that it valued in Europe: virtuosity, melodic and rhythmic<br/>complexity, sophistication. And predictably, explorers in this field were after<br/>discovering and preserving stunning new finds, like their musicological counterparts<br/>were after discovering and preserving stunning old manuscripts.<br/>Little of this was intellectually exciting to me, so I spent most of my time<br/>training as a linguist figuring that the anthropological study of languages<br/>and oral traditions was far less shadowed by such big aesthetic and political<br/>agendas. When it came time to do a dissertation fieldwork project on some aspect<br/>of language and music, I abandoned the usual framework (e.g., &quot;The Music of<br/>the Bongo-Bongo: An Ethnomusicological Analysis of their Song Texts&quot;) and<br/>rudely called my project by a deliberate counter term: an ethnography of sound, or,<br/>an ethnography of sound as a symbol system. I wanted to study ways sound and<br/>sounding link environment, language, and musical experience and expression.<br/>Taking up the simple hypothesis (one I&apos;d heard years before, from my u<br/>ndergraduate teachers Colin Turnbull and Edmund Carpenter) that rainforest environments<br/>might be the places where humans developed to acute levels of acoustic<br/>adaptation, I headed for the rainforests of south central Papua New Guinea, about as<br/>remote and different a place as I could possibly try to experience and know.<br/>&quot;As I learned about the symbolism of the weeping and singing voice I was<br/>taught about their intimate connection to rainforest birds.&quot;<br/>In Papua New Guinea I lived through 1976-7 with the Kaluli people of Bosavi,<br/>on the Great Papuan Plateau, working in collaboration with another<br/>ethnographer, Edward L. Schieffelin (see his The Sorrow of the Lonely and the Burning of<br/>the Dancers, 1976, St. Martin&apos;s Press, for a study of Kaluli rituals and<br/>ceremonialism), and another linguist, Bambi B. Schieffelin (see her The Give and<br/>Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children, 1990,<br/>Cambridge University Press, for a study of how Kaluli children acquire language and<br/>culture). My focus was on ritualized vocal expression, principally Kaluli<br/>women&apos;s funerary sung weeping and Kaluli men&apos;s ceremonial poetic songs that brought<br/>audience members to tears. As I learned about the symbolism of the weeping and<br/>singing voice I was taught about their intimate connection to rainforest<br/>birds. This is because birds, for Kaluli as with most Melanesians, are spirits,<br/>and spirit voices _from talk to cries to song_are reflected in bird sounds.<br/>Ritual weeping and song recall and evoke the presence of spirits, and are<br/>understood as expressions of sadness embodied in being a bird. This sadness makes<br/>listeners cry like birds, completing a symbolic and emotional circle.<br/>In this and other ways I learned how the ecology of natural sounds is central<br/>to a local musical ecology, and how this musical ecology maps onto the<br/>rainforest environment. For songs and weeping not only recall and announce spirits,<br/>their texts, sung in a poetry called &quot;bird sound words&quot;, sequentially name<br/>places and co-occurring environmental features of vegetation, light and sound.<br/>Songs become what Kaluli call a &quot;path&quot;, namely a series of place-names that link<br/>the cartography of the rainforest to the movement of its past and present<br/>inhabitants. These song paths are also linked to the spirit world of birds, whose<br/>flight patterns weave through trails and water courses, connecting a spirit<br/>cosmology above to local histories on the ground.<br/>I analyzed these sorts of issues to write an ethnography of sound (Sound and<br/>Sentiment: Birds, Weeping, Poetics and Song in Kaluli Expression, 1982,<br/>University of Pennsylvania Press; expanded second edition, l990). The book concerned<br/>the Kaluli world of birds, myth, and cosmology and how they were united with<br/>poetry, song and lament. My interpretation showed how Bosavi birds turn into<br/>Kaluli singers and weepers, how Kaluli singers and weepers turn into Bosavi<br/>birds, and how all of this is a local ecology of &quot;voices in the forest&quot;.<br/>It wasn&apos;t until the early 1980&apos;s, when most of this research and writing was<br/>initially done, and I was teaching courses on sound at the Annenberg School of<br/>Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, that I encountered R.<br/>Murray Schafer&apos;s The Tuning of the World (1977, Knopf) and the publications of the<br/>World Soundscape Project. I found these publications very exciting; they<br/>opened new windows into a familiar world, one that could now be re-imagined from<br/>the standpoints of acoustic ecology and soundscape studies. I took these<br/>publications with me to the Bosavi rainforest during my field trips in the 1980&apos;s,<br/>and re-reading R. Murray Schafer&apos;s suggestion that people &quot;echo the soundscape<br/>in language and music&quot; I began to transform myself from an ethnomusicologist to<br/>an echo-muse-ecologist.<br/>&quot;Ethno&quot; always implies otherness, but &quot;echo&quot; is about presence, about<br/>reverberant pasts in the present, presents in the past. And I remembered: sound is<br/>memory, here as everywhere. From there I began to explore how the Kaluli<br/>soundscape, from its bird calls to song paths of place-names, is always about memory,<br/>about absence and presence, about how in the forest sound reveals what vision<br/>conceals. This is beautifully enunciated in the Kaluli idea for &quot;echo&quot;, the<br/>mimetic compound &quot;gugu-gawgaw.&quot; &quot;Gu&quot; is downward moving sound; by duplication<br/>&quot;gugu&quot; marks the action as continuous. &quot;Gaw&quot; is outward moving sound; &quot;gawgaw&quot;<br/>likewise marks continuity. So the auditorally ambiguous melange of continuous<br/>downward and outward moving sound is what is heard and instantly felt as<br/>&quot;echo&quot;. In the forest one easily confuses the height and depth of sound,<br/>particularly in the absence of visual cues. In this place &quot;echo&quot; means that upward<br/>sounds like outward. The phonesthesia (phonetic synaesthesia) of Kaluli vowels<br/>trace movement this way, becoming one with what they sound like in both everyday<br/>language and song poetry.<br/>&quot;Lift-up-over sounding&quot;, like &quot;harmony&quot;, is both a grand metaphor for natural<br/>sonic relations ... as well as for social relations ...<br/>The blur from music-ology to muse-ecology was equally obvious, for the<br/>important thing in Bosavi wasn&apos;t &quot;pieces&quot; or &quot;forms&quot; of music in isolation, but<br/>rather the constant interplay of inspiration, imitation, and incorporation that<br/>linked the flow of natural and human sound expressions. A way of hearing the<br/>world comes from interacting with it, but it also has to do with appreciating it,<br/>imagining it as one&apos;s very own. Linking forest birds and places with voices<br/>and experiences was more a search for &quot;patterns that connect&quot;, Gregory<br/>Bateson&apos;s notion in Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972, Ballentine), than it was the<br/>&quot;sciencing about music&quot; my ethnomusicology pro&pound; Alan Merriam advocated in his<br/>The Anthropology of Music (1964, Northwestern University Press).<br/>Exploring Kaluli echo-muse-ecology in the Bosavi rainforests lead me to<br/>realize that what I was trying to understand all along was that the language and<br/>music of nature are intimately connected with the nature of language and music.<br/>Shifting from the realm of ritual performances to that of everyday experience<br/>and expression I learned that sounds are heard as time of day, season of year,<br/>vegetation cycles, migratory patterns, forest heights and depths. Place<br/>resounds as a fused human locus of space and time. Local acoustic ecology can thus<br/>be considered a kind of aesthetic adaptation, a naturalization of place, or,<br/>put differently, a pattern of ecological and aesthetic co-evolution.<br/>The most recent extension of these concerns, developed in the field research<br/>I&apos;ve done in the 1990s, is what I call acoustemology (i.e., acoustic<br/>epistemology). These days I am exploring acoustic knowing as a centrepiece of Kaluli<br/>experience; how sounding and the sensual, bodily, experiencing of sound is a<br/>special kind of knowing, or put differently, how sonic sensibility is basic to<br/>experiential truth in the Bosavi forests. Sounds emerge from and are<br/>perceptually centred in place, not to mention sung with, to, and about places. Just as<br/>&quot;life takes place&quot; so does sound; thus more and more my experiential accounts of<br/>the Kaluli sound world have become acoustic studies of how senses make place<br/>and places make sense.<br/>...the full body is always present in the &quot;flow&quot; of the voice, just as the<br/>connections of land are always present in the &quot;flow&quot; of water...<br/>Two important keynotes of a Kaluli acoustemology, both richly hearable on<br/>Voices of the Rainforest (CD/cassette, l99l, Rykodisc), my hour-long soundscape<br/>of a day in the life of Bosavi and the Kaluli, are complex local notions<br/>translatable only as &quot;lift-up-over sounding&quot;, and &quot;flow.&quot; The first of these,<br/>&quot;lift-up-over sounding&quot; is as potentially omnipresent in the experiences and<br/>aesthetics of Kaluli as the notion of &quot;harmony&quot; is in the West.<br/>&quot;Lift-up-oversounding&quot;, like &quot;harmony&quot;, is both a grand metaphor for natural sonic relations, the<br/>ways tones combine together in time, as well as for social relations, for<br/>people doing things together in concert. In the Kaluli world &quot;lift-up-over<br/>sounding&quot; sounds are dense and layered, blended, and forever thinning and thickening.<br/>One hears no unison, only a constant figure to ground motion of densities,<br/>decays and fades, of overlapping, alternating, and interlocking sounds. These<br/>sounds, whether in the forest, in Kaluli music singing, or in the overlap of the<br/>two, are &quot;in-synchrony but out of phase&quot;. By this I mean that they are always<br/>cohesive, yet always seeming, as well, to be at different points of<br/>displacement from a hypothetical unison. Neither a clear-cut polyphony nor heterophony,<br/>&quot;lift-up-over sounding&quot; sounds define an acoustic space-time where upward is<br/>outward. One sound stands out momentarily, then just as quickly fades into a<br/>distance, overlapped or echoed by a new or repeated emergence in the mosaic.<br/>This pattern of sounding in the natural environment is the inspiration for many<br/>Kaluli vocal and instrumental forms. Likewise it is the pattern of fluid but<br/>tense egalitarian social life, where an anarchic synchrony of energy and<br/>assertion take prominence over fixed categories, in a social order without political<br/>or economic hierarchy.<br/>One of the ever-present &quot;lift-up-over sounding&quot; sounds of the Bosavi<br/>environment, layered as a ground to the remarkable figures of avian life, is the hiss<br/>of water. Runoff from Mt. Bosavi, an extinct volcano, crisscrosses the Bosavi<br/>lands, turning into numerous rivers, creeks, falls, and streams. Walking means<br/>crossing water, yet always hearing it before seeing it. Water carries in and<br/>out of visual perceptual immediacy but always has dramatic, though<br/>ever-changing, acoustic presence. This carrying power, moving through and connecting<br/>lands, is water&apos;s &quot;flow&quot;. But this &quot;flow&quot; does not only exist in the way water<br/>connects what Kaluli call the &quot;thighs&quot; (i.e., saddles) and &quot;body&quot; (i.e., hills)<br/>of the land. Water is to land what the voice is to the body. The voice connects<br/>the many parts of the body; by resounding in the head and chest, the full<br/>body is always present in the &quot;flow&quot; of the voice, just as the connections of<br/>land are always present in the &quot;flow&quot; of water.<br/>Water flow also animates much of Kaluli musical imagination, as all waterway<br/>terms are also the names for the musical intervals, the segments of song, the<br/>patterns of rhythm, and the contours of melody. And composing songs is like<br/>getting a &quot;waterfall in your head&quot;; the pool is the melody in motion and the<br/>fall the text mixing into the melody to create song. Kaluli compose their songs<br/>by creeks or waterfalls, singing with and to them. And the texts of these songs<br/>are maps of waterways or trails, viewing them from above as spirit birds<br/>might. Additionally, &quot;flow&quot; is also the carrying power of poetic song, the way it<br/>stays in memory. A waterway can be continually heard but visually appears,<br/>disappears, and reappears when one walks through forest trails. This is its<br/>&quot;flow&quot;, its path of carrying. Likewise as one hears a song, it disappears quickly<br/>from an experiential foreground and reappears through time in memory,<br/>reverberating and lingering in sonic traces and fragments, far past and beyond the<br/>moment of an immediate experienced performance.<br/>This is how Kaluli songs, like Bosavi waterways, &quot;flow&quot;, emerging in the<br/>density of a &quot;lift-up-over sounding&quot; soundscape of rainforest acoustic ecology.<br/>On Voices of the Rainforest you can hear many kinds of Kaluli &quot;liftup-over<br/>sounding&quot;, from birds waking a village, to women singing, whistling and talking<br/>with their children as they work to scrape and pound sago, to men whooping and<br/>singing as they clear a forest garden, to a bamboo jews harp duet with cicada<br/>rhythms and bird calls, to singing with a creek, to the dusk volleys of frogs<br/>and birds overlapped by an evening rainstorm, to a quartet of in-sync and out<br/>of phase drummers, and a duo of ceremonial singers overlapped by a man who is<br/>moved to crying by their song, to the density of night winds, mists, frogs,<br/>and insects.<br/>The aesthetic apex of this &quot;lift-up-over sounding&quot; is where it meets with the<br/>&quot;flow&quot; of poetic song, on a section of Voices of the Rainforest called<br/>&quot;Relaxing at the Creek. &quot; Here a woman named Ulahi sings three songs, in three<br/>different song genres, all with and to the Wolu, a creek situated near her village.<br/>Her voice develops a pulsing pattern that densely flows with the sounds of<br/>the creek where she sits, and her songs develop different place paths, including<br/>one that sings a long succession of places connected to the creek she is<br/>singing in. On these selections the performative flow of singing with water and<br/>the musicality of singing like water connect deeply to the emplacing poetry of<br/>singing about water. Evoking the flowing presence of creek paths, Ulahi&apos;s<br/>songs, like the Wolu creek where she sang them, meander and flow through Kaluli<br/>lives and memories, by linking together places and suggesting that the flow of<br/>their names tell stories about events and feedings. Ulabi once told me that<br/>every one of her songs (I&apos;ve recorded about 200 of them since the mid-1970&apos;s) was<br/>like a pool on a creek. So every Kaluli song swirls, centres, circles in<br/>place, then flows on to mingle and merge with places and voices elsewhere.<br/>Singing about water, with water, and imagining song as water and vocal<br/>flow_here the poetry of place meets the sensuality of soundscape and the singing<br/>voice. This is where the &quot;lift-up-over sounding&quot; of Kaluli song &quot;flow&quot; creates an<br/>acoustemology of embodied place resounding.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Steven Feld is Professor of Anthropology and Music, and Director of the<br/>Center for Studies in Folklore and Ethnomusicology at the University of Texas at<br/>Austin, Texas 78712 USA (Tel. 512-471-0057, Fax 512-471-6535, e-mail<br/><a href="mailto:71532.2344@compuserve.com">71532.2344@compuserve.com</a><br/>This article is a short abstract of his talk-slide-audio presentation at The<br/>Tuning of the World Conference on Acoustic Ecology, held at the Banff Centre<br/>for the Arts, Banff, Canada, in August 1993.</p></div>
