I found the folks over there very open minded, and more than a little bit interested in exploring other tuning systems. I think the fretless guitar is a great opening into the world of tunings, and I am finding more and more guitarists getting into it, and having instruments made. Stayed with Manuel op de Coul, wow, what a hoot...his CD and book collection could keep one busy for many moons; just wish the books were in English, but what a great collection of obscure books on tunings. A great experience overall...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>   <a href="http://agenturadellarte.net">agenturadellarte.net</a></p></div>
