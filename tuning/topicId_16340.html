The half wave length reinforcement for a ten foot ceiling (parallel to the floor) would thus be 66.5 Hz, for example.  Not only parallel surfaces result in standing waves, but also diagonals out of right angle intersections (i.e., wall and floor) and corners.  There is a formula devised by Lord Rayleigh for computing all of these for a rectangular type room.  As the frequency increases, the number of resonances increases, becoming closer together.   Depending on the proportions of the room, these may be well or poorly spaced.

A further correction for differences in temperature is about 1.1 feet per second faster for each degree Fahrenheit warmer.

Not only the lowest resonance (66.5 Hz in the example) but all integer multiples of it will form standing waves (two times, three times, etc.).  The worst case would be a cube, because of the common dimensions causing the resonances to be bunched rather than spread out.  Smaller rooms will have more uneven bass reinforcement than a well designed large auditorium might, because the latter will have subsonic resonances and when the audible range is reached, the resonances may be spaced well enough to reinforce all the tones of the scale in the lowest octave rather than only one or two.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:jsprague@dhcr.state.ny.us">jsprague@dhcr.state.ny.us</a> 12/08/00 05:06PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>That depends on the dimensions of the room and its temperature.
