Most of what I will say is condensed and paraphrased<br/>from Xenharmonikon 15, Autumn 1993  (available from the Just Intonation<br/>Network and Frog Peak Music).  I recommend this issue and XH13 to anyone<br/>seriously interested in scales of these types. One might play them with<br/>timbres generated as described in William Sethares&apos;s book &quot;Tuning,<br/>Timbre, Spectrum, Scale.&quot;</p><p>Phi Tonality:</p><p>Walter O&apos;Connell (with help from Brian McLaren) updated an article<br/>originally written for Die Reihe in the 1960&apos;s and privately distributed<br/>after Die Reihe ceased publication. The article is &quot;The Tonality of the<br/>Golden Section,&quot;  and in it O&apos;Connell proposed a timbre based on powers<br/>of phi and an ultrachromatic gamut which is the equal division of phi<br/>into twenty five parts (25 degrees of 36-tet is a very good<br/>approximation to phi/1). Out of this set of pitches, he selected modes<br/>with 7,9, 11 and 14 tones.</p><p>Another early inventor of phi-based scales is David E. Schroer, who used<br/>the 2nd and 3rd order difference tones between two pitches differing by<br/>phi to generate the intervals. Schroer called his system<br/>&quot;Aureotonality,&quot; but I have been unable to find out much more about it.</p><p>In my introductory remarks (Notes and Comments) , I mentioned a scale of<br/>5 tones within Phi invented by Lorne Temes, who in 1970 was a student in<br/>Toronto.  Temes&apos;s scale was approximately 1.0 1.169 1.236 1.309 1.382<br/>and 1.618 (phi). These intervals correspond to 1/1, phi^3/(phi^2+1),<br/>2/phi, phi^2/2, (phi^2+1)/phi^2, and phi. The tone phi^3/(phi^2+1) is<br/>proposed as the dominant. If anyone knows Temes or his/her present<br/>whereabouts, I&apos;d appreciate the information.</p><p>Self-Similar Scales:</p><p> Brian McLaren, in his article &quot;The Uses and Characteristics of Non-Just<br/>Non-Equal-Tempered Scales,&quot; discusses a number of different kinds of<br/>schemes to generate new types of  scales, a topic he began in XH13<br/>(1991) with &quot;General Methods for Generating Musical Scales.&quot; The type of<br/>scale he terms &quot;integrated self-similar&quot; is generated from a single<br/>relation. For example, the &quot;E Scale&quot; is constructed by computing the<br/>cents span of the interval e/1 (2.71828....),  or 1731.234 cents. This<br/>interval and each successive quotient is then divided by e to obtain the<br/>scale 1731.234, 636.885, 234.297, 86.193, 31.709, 11.66 and 4.29 cents.<br/>Similarly, McLaren starts with pi, sqr(3), sqr(5), sqr(7) and mentions<br/>using the square roots of 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on.</p><p>These scales differ from the examples I have posted or sent by private<br/>email in that McLaren uses a constant divisor and I a constant<br/>operation. In my case, I started with an interval such as pi, phi, or<br/>3/1 and repeatedly took the square, cube or higher root. McLaren<br/>selected an interval, converted it to cents, and iteratively divided it<br/>by the same interval.  I stopped the process when the intervals come too<br/>small and added a final 0 tone. McLaren generally does not.</p><p>Later in the article, McLaren  defines &quot;Integrated non-self-similar&quot;<br/>scales. The example he gives is obtained by first computing the cents<br/>value of the sqr(3), 950.9775. This is divided by the sqr(5), the result<br/>of this by the sqr(7),  and so on.   The remainder of his paper is<br/>devoted to scales generated by infinite continued fractions, metal bar<br/>spectra and other techniques.</p><p>I might add that Brink McGoogy has also proposed using certain<br/>irrational intervals to construct scales in an article in XH15. Brink<br/>composes and performs &quot;Xenphionic&quot; music and<br/>writes neo-Dadaistic prose, some of which he has collected as &quot;xyzonia,<br/>a book of devices.&quot;</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=4932 href="#4932">ðŸ”—</a>HPBohlen@xxx.xxx</h3><span>9/19/1999 11:47:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, John, for all the additional information on &quot;Golden Ratio&quot; scales.<br/>Seem&apos;s that with my 7-tone selection inside phi I have re-invented O&apos;Connels<br/>wheel.
