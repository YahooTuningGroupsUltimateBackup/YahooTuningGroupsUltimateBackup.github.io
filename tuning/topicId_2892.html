Barbara Hero and I discussed your work<br/>three years ago before we recorded the Atlantis record with Denny Genovese<br/>and my ensemble The Big Swifty. I especially appreciated your inclusion of<br/>the Raga ratios at a time (then) I was beginning my Just/Raag/danielou<br/>understandings.</p><p>Ray Tomes wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz">rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz</a> (Ray Tomes)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s important to emphasize that in the blues, the &apos;7th&apos; is<br/>&gt; &gt;used as a *harmonic 7th* (7:4) in virtually every chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I Agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I feel this rational interpretation is valid because these<br/>&gt; &gt;chords *do not* follow the type of &apos;dominant 7th&apos; resolution<br/>&gt; &gt;rules that classical music uses (which require a non-harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt;&apos;7th&apos;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have been in this argument before, but I don&apos;t think that the chord<br/>&gt; C-E-G-Bb can possibly mean anything other than the ratios 4:5:6:7 in any<br/>&gt; system of music.  It may be classically correct that Bb is 16/9 times C<br/>&gt; or whatever (which it would be if played with an F) but the raios would<br/>&gt; then be 36:45:54:64 which is impossibly complex to be &quot;intentional&quot;.<br/>&gt; IMO the old theory does not match the composers &quot;real musical intention&quot;<br/>&gt; which must be 4:5:6:7 even if the instrument cannot produce that as<br/>&gt; ratios of 36:45:54:64 can have no meaning at all.  The problem is that<br/>&gt; apart from the main notes in the key the others have multiple possible<br/>&gt; different meanings and so a strict rule will often be wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;At the same time, I&apos;ve found that the &apos;#IV/bV&apos; can often<br/>&gt; &gt;be analyzed as a harmonic tone: it&apos;s simply an 11:8, or<br/>&gt; &gt;sometimes a 7:5 or 10:7, and *possibly* a 23:16, altho<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m not at all sure that such a high prime is really<br/>&gt; &gt;useful in describing blues, especially since 23:16 is<br/>&gt; &gt;only ~11 cents higher than the much simpler 10:7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I say go with the 11:8 and forget the others.  In your subsequent<br/>&gt; discussion you also raise the 13:8 ratio which I think can occur.<br/>&gt; However putting numbers like 7 in the denominator, where they represent<br/>&gt; the tonic, is generally going to be wrong even if the numbers are<br/>&gt; smaller.  When in a minor then the tonic may be 5 but otherwise probably<br/>&gt; not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having said that, I think that the 7 limit is adequate for most pieces<br/>&gt; and that the 11 and 13 ratios are exceptions.  I base my opinions<br/>&gt; entirely on theoretical grounds in relation to how I understand music<br/>&gt; originates in the universe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>&gt;    Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>&gt; Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>&gt; Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
