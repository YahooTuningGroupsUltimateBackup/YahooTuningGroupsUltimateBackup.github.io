We could have GTOP tunings for example which is the<br/>golden tuning that has the lowest max Tenney-weighted error. 5-limit<br/>Meantone would have an octave of 1201.813671648584 cents and a fifth<br/>of 697.2667276651778 cents, I think. Interestingly, it seems that we<br/>must specify the MOS we want to use because for example the above<br/>numbers give L:s of Phi+1 for Meantone[3] while all the rest of the<br/>MOSes have L:s or Phi.
