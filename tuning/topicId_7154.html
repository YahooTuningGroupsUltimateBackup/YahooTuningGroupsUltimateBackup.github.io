(Indeed,<br/>anglophones might even find them to often be &quot;impertent&quot; as well).</p><p>I&apos;ve learned the hard way that common practice harmony teaching, particularly<br/>in the US, is largely divorced from the rhetorical and affective context of<br/>the practice.  When harmony is reduced to a matter of pushing notes around on<br/>staff paper, then what those figures might mean is given short change. When<br/>one hears a chord, knowing that it has function a in key x, and then suddenly<br/>discovers with the following chord that that it has taken on a completely<br/>different function b in key y, or when one hears a chord with multiple<br/>meanings get resolved in an unexpected way, then you&apos;re really at the height<br/>of classical tonal practice.  The affect of such moves can be surreprising,<br/>tragiddical, pyronic, even punny...</p><p>Incidentally, my current project, a small  &quot;opera seria for handpuppets&quot; (for<br/>which Edw. Gorey has written the libretto) is set in the 18th century and the<br/>tonal language in largely 18th century as well. (I&apos;m trying to have archaic<br/>and eat it, too). It is set for a small ensemble with continuo tack piano in<br/>Eb-G#  standard meantone; meantone is so full of puntentiality that I&apos;ve<br/>taken to calling it &quot;swell tamperment&quot;.</p></div>
