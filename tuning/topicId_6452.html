Although quantitative studies of the WTC appear to<br/>&gt;reveal that its composition was indeed informed by such a tuning,</p><p>I&apos;ve read this in several places, but can&apos;t remember any convincing<br/>examples.  I am more inclined to accept Everett Hafner&apos;s thesis, that the<br/>tuning wrench was to be used before each piece.  Two points on Hafner&apos;s<br/>article:</p><p>1. He suggests that if the WTC was performed by order of 5ths rather than<br/>number it would support his thesis, but the WTC was not meant to be<br/>performed as a whole at all, and almost certainly was not during Bach&apos;s<br/>lifetime.</p><p>2. The second book is much less forgiving than the first as far a staying<br/>within the consonant areas of one 12-tone meantone key.  And what was Bach<br/>to do at the organ -- his organ book is the most chromatic of all his output.</p><p>&gt;it is also known that a good number of its pieces were simply transposed<br/>&gt;from earlier works,</p><p>Some points of interest here: 1. Was the composition then so tailored to<br/>the specific key of irregular temperament?  2. The first book of the WTC<br/>was probably not meant to be published at all.  3. Bach did not see the<br/>title &quot;Well Tempered Clavier&quot; in his lifetime.</p><p>&gt;All we know for sure is that, once he had adopted the premise of a closed 12<br/>&gt;tone temperament, Bach instructed that the major thirds be tuned sharp in<br/>&gt;order to achieve that end.</p><p>Bach is definitely on record for preferring closed temperament.  There&apos;s<br/>even a story relayed by Bosanquet of Bach playing in the worst keys on a<br/>meantone organ when its builder was around, to annoy him.  When the builder<br/>complains, Bach says, &quot;You build them as you like, and I play them as I like&quot;.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/1/1999 9:51:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Two points on Hafner&apos;s article:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1. He suggests that if the WTC was performed by order of 5ths rather than<br/>&gt;number it would support his thesis,</p><p>Bach could have arranged them by 5ths, and I seem to recall that certain<br/>historical precedents to the WTC (Fischer? Kuhnau?) were arranged that way<br/>-- yet Bach decided, both in the 48 and in the Inventions and Sinfonia, to<br/>arrange them scale-wise.</p><p>&gt;but the WTC was not meant to be performed as a whole at all,</p><p>Of course not. Who would dream such a thing? It would take hours (though I<br/>have heard of a competition where the pianists do just that -- how would<br/>you like to judge that!).</p><p>&gt;2. The first book of the WTC<br/>&gt;was probably not meant to be published at all.</p><p>Only a tiny fraction of Bach&apos;s work was published in his lifetime.</p><p>&gt;3. Bach did not see the<br/>&gt;title &quot;Well Tempered Clavier&quot; in his lifetime.</p><p>The autograph title page of the first volume (dated 1722) is &quot;Das Wohl<br/>Temperirte Clavier or Preludes and Fugues through all the tones and<br/>semitones both as regards the teria major or ut re mi and as concerns the<br/>teria minor or re mi fa...&quot; The Well Tempered Clavier is Bach&apos;s own title.</p><p>The idea that Bach intended to retune before each piece strikes me as<br/>counter to the whole point of the Well Tempered Clavier. Why would Bach go<br/>to the trouble of creating a collection of pieces in all the keys if not to<br/>demonstrate that playing them from a singled &quot;well tempered&quot; tuning was<br/>possible? It is true that many of the individual works can be played in<br/>meantone, and may work quite well, but others are quite chromatic.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
