I hope that I won&apos;t have to leave<br/>again, but also wish to remind the list that there are legitimate reasons<br/>why electronic communications costs are high in places like Hungary and<br/>people do pay a premium for bandwidth.</p><p>(2) Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>Why is it that all the major research libraries subscribe to 1/1 (the<br/>Journal of the Just Intonation Network) but virtually none subscribe to<br/>Xenharmonikon? (I have a personal interest in this question because I<br/>believe that my article in Xenharmonikon 17 addresses an issue common in the<br/>current journals, namely, generalizing diatonicity, but I fear that it will<br/>not get the attention that I believe it deserves from academia. Not to<br/>mention the attention that Wilson&apos;s many papers deserve.)</p><p>At the beginning, XH was published as an &quot;informal journal&quot;, a vehicle for<br/>communication within a community of scholars and musicians.  Early issues of<br/>Xenharmonikon were available from University Microfilms, now all issues are<br/>available in print on demand format from Frog Peak.  At the time that I<br/>edited XH, only Wesleyan University and the Music Library at U.C.Berkeley<br/>subscribed. At one point and at my own expense, I sent out sample issues to<br/>some one hundred University or research libraries. None requested<br/>subsciptions although XH had already received a number of prominent<br/>citations.</p><p>I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that a photocopied journal produced by scholars<br/>largely employed outside of academe, on a topic that had not yet become<br/>either acceptable or even hot for academic research simply could not gain<br/>entree into scholarly libraries. In spite of this, I have seldom encountered<br/>on body of writing on music theory that was so often read in such detail by<br/>a readership both serious and diverse. In the meantime, intonation and<br/>tuning system theory have become acceptable subjects in even journals which<br/>previously were actively dismissive of our work.</p><p>(3) I look forward to perusing the archives for the thread on defining &quot;Just<br/>Intonation&quot;.  Without benefit of this entire discussion, I will jump in and<br/>offer my thought that the qualities, extent, and limits of JI, pending some<br/>overwhelming general restrictions with regard to tonal perception, have to<br/>be understood as _not yet defined_.  I believe that that definition has to<br/>be articulated compositionally, that is, within the context of real musical<br/>examples.  I have no great confidence in the use of research based on<br/>normative models to answer this question, if simply because it is my<br/>experience, and my music-historical understanding, that compositional<br/>invention has continuously tested the barriers of what we are able to hear<br/>as music, and by implication, as music in JI.</p><p>Leaving aside for the moment the catastrophic effects on human hearing due<br/>to the noises of an over-amplified world, my assumption remains that we will<br/>continue to hear more possibilities rather than fewer as musical, and that<br/>applies to the intervals of JI as well.  My experiences with comparing the<br/>subjective consonance of intervals (where I came &apos;round to hearing, all else<br/>being equal, the denominator of a ratio as most determinative)  suggested<br/>strongly that register, for example, can be used compositionally to project<br/>previously exotic ratios in parseable ways.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest &amp; Morro Bay<br/><a href="mailto:djwolf1@matavnet.hu">djwolf1@matavnet.hu</a><br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div><h3><a id=16586 href="#16586">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Wild &#x3C;wild@fas.harvard.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2000 4:58:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; At the time that I edited XH, only Wesleyan University and the<br/>&gt; Music Library at U.C.Berkeley subscribed.
