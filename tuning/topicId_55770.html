The Pythagorean comma either has to be handled<br/>stepwise somewhere in the piece, or we have to sprinkle little bits<br/>of it around so there&apos;s not such a noticeable single step of it.<br/>Furthermore, since melodically our cantus firmus starts on each of<br/>twelve different notes and rises and descends diatonically, there&apos;s<br/>simply nowhere to put a single complete Pythagorean comma step into<br/>some tone or semitone without it being noticeable.</p><p>This has to be a case of temperament, not extra keys on the &apos;board to<br/>deliver all or a subset of 19edo.  Furthermore, it works very well on<br/>a typically 17th century French/Italianate layout of modified<br/>meantone where the sharps are pretty much &quot;as is&quot; (and/or slightly<br/>raised, to taste, making them more exciting), and F-Bb-Eb are wide<br/>fifths, leaving merely a wolf puppy at the normal Eb-G# position.<br/>The<br/>occurrences of Eb-G# (and their enharmonics) are disguised in weak or<br/>passing parts of the beat, metrically, or hidden under the thickness<br/>of other notes (minor chords are especially useful in this regard),<br/>or touched and released quickly in small note values.  Hide that<br/>puppy!  Such a modified-meantone layout is not the only available<br/>solution, but it&apos;s an easily practical one.</p><p>One of Froberger&apos;s toccatas from 1649 either has to have a good<br/>temperament or it needs split keys C#/Db, D#/Eb, and G#/Ab.

So, if we start off<br/>with pure F-A, G-B, and C-E, each of their tempered-accidental<br/>bisectors (two averaged major thirds splitting the minor sixth) is<br/>going to be half a schisma shy of a syntonic comma too sharp (i.e.<br/>very slightly narrower than Pythagorean).  That&apos;s quite a hot C#, Eb,<br/>and G#.  Even more so if you&apos;ve started with major thirds that are<br/>smaller than pure.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=55816 href="#55816">ðŸ”—</a>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2004 12:39:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; No circle of fifths.

I ran the Bull piece through the nytonyx stylizer,<br/>which perversly added midi controller 1 (modulation) commands to the<br/>midi file. Midi controller 1 in a file seems to prevent Scala from<br/>retuning, and I think it would be a good idea for Scala to remove<br/>these controller values and proceed anyway.</p><p>Howbeit, there they were. I had the same reaction--I listened, and<br/>something seemed to be wrong; so I checked and I wasn&apos;t getting any<br/>tuning data in the midi files from my Scala commands. If I had a text<br/>editor which could remove any line which had a given expression on it,<br/>I could have used that, but I don&apos;t know of one. What I did was edited<br/>controller 1 to something which I hoped didn&apos;t do anything. I ended up<br/>using controller 81, which seems to work, but I tried controller 70<br/>first, and that also seemed to be a problem. The result was I had a<br/>lot of versions lying around, some of which were, in fact, in 12<br/>equal, since Scala didn&apos;t put in any tuning data when I asked it to.</p><p>This time I uploaded a pitch bend version of the ogg file (I can&apos;t<br/>tell any difference between the pitch bend and the MTS versions, so<br/>this shouldn&apos;t matter) and the pitch bended midi file which was<br/>rendered.
