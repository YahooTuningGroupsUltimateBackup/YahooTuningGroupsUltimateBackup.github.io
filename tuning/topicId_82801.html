So, with the exception of the scales made by Wilson and Sethares (and I realize Wilson still follows the harmonic series to a decent extent)...I haven&apos;t seen much that strikes me as both very consonant and significantly different than 12TET.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;ve found that some people REALLY take that the wrong way, as if I&apos;m saying their expertise is somehow wrong or that I THINK I know as much or more than them in their field of expertise.&nbsp; Truth is I think neither...I&apos;m simply saying I&apos;m heading in a different direction (minus psychoacoustic phenomena such as critical-roughness that effect&nbsp; all sound-forms and not just the harmonic<br/> series).<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--&quot;Why would anybody with two brain cells to rub together send<br/>--any posts about whether LucyTuning is original or not?&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is...who cares?&nbsp; I agree with you it was Harrison who devised it: and, as you said, Charles Lucy openly credits him (so it&apos;s not like he&apos;s some terrible thief).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My question about LucyTuning and virtually all tunings I hear (and, believe me, I&apos;ve tried hundreds thanks to programs like Fractal Tune Smithy).....is can musicians make good use of it...especially in ways that take musical thought in a new direction (rather than just purifying the same old thing)?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&apos;t really like LucyTuning that much either...but at the same time I realize a lot of musicians have found great uses for it.&nbsp; Therefore, regardless of &quot;academic formallities&quot;...LONG LIVE<br/> LUCY-TUNING!<br/>&nbsp;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>---&quot;Those terms you&apos;ve thrown up ... yes, if you don&apos;t know what<br/>---a tetrad is you&apos;ll have difficulty discussing harmony.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; But there you go assuming when I say &quot;consonance&quot; I mean &quot;harmony&quot;.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;ve said probably hundreds of times I&apos;m looking for consonant scales, but not &quot;harmony&quot; or &quot;low-limit compliance&quot; and people still can&apos;t get it around their heads that noble-number based scales DON&apos;T involve harmony or limits but do involve consonance.<br/>-----<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, my scales are not based on the harmonic series and terms used exclusively to the harmonic series, no matter how expertly devised, are not relevant to them.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the record, I know the term tetrad (any 4 note chord)...but what Carl was bugging me about was<br/> my using prime-limit to characterize my tetrads instead of odd-limit.&nbsp; Then again, my scales, being not based on low-numbered fractions, have no relevance to the term limit in the first place.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, WHAT FRUSTRATES ME is the way people get pissed off at me (not to mention flame me a lot) simply for not using JI terms (especially the whole LIMIT = consonance assumption) even when I&apos;m working with non-JI scales which don&apos;t even involve the musical definition &quot;limit&quot;!&nbsp;&nbsp; Such people reserve the right to hate my scales...but calling them things they aren&apos;t even vaguely related to or trying to impulsively force them into the &quot;closest historical equivalent that fits with rational numerology&quot; isn&apos;t exactly showing much respect toward myself.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>---&quot;How are you deciding that the rest of us aren&apos;t open<br/> minded?&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never said all or most people on the list were close minded.&nbsp; Though the few who are sure are loud (LOL).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I will say those who try to pigeon-hole my scale into rational scale algorithms they are expert with and then blame the scale for not fitting it well are being blatantly disrespectful, not to mention not helping improve the scale in question in terms of consonance (NOT harmony NOT limits...just consonance).&nbsp; The worst thing is some of said people stereotype it and then make it a double-whammy whining at me for my not agreeing with their stereotype of it!<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--&quot;Oh, it&apos;s defamation now, is it?&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, saying something I make is something it&apos;s not and then blaming me for being &quot;dumb&quot; for not agreeing with the stereotype?&nbsp; Yes, I&apos;d say people<br/> who do that are being pretty low...almost as if they are betting on me not to be able to give evidence.&nbsp; Far as evidence...believe me....I think my fairly high ratio of sound samples to match my explanations pretty much speaks for itself.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--&quot;Yes, he doesn&apos;t post very often.  I don&apos;t know how you&apos;re<br/>--assessing coldness of a response.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; A cold response to me is either a message&apos;s not getting many responses...or getting ones that become blatantly off-topic very quickly IE &quot;de-railing the thread&quot;.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--&quot;Close[d]-mindedness about LucyTuning?  But before, weren&apos;t<br/>--we all advocating variations of meantone?&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two completely different topics.&nbsp; I respect Lucy-Tuning<br/> and Mean-tone as they have been and continue to be useful to many musicians.&nbsp; When I discussed close minded-ness as far as Lucy-Tuning, I was talking about the odd obsession many people had about flaming Charles about &quot;is LucyTuning&apos;s use of PI special or not...and was it created in an original fashion&quot;?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I hope people respect how Charles derived LucyTuning from Harrison&apos;s writings, RATHER than whining about things like who has the right to ownership or how they can, say, magically re-create it without using PI...I hope they can respect that I don&apos;t create my scales in the same way they do theirs and some of their expertise in their areas may not instantly work-in/&quot;solve&quot; some of my scales.<br/>&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--&quot;Everybody else has us much right to be an idiot as you.  You don&apos;t own<br/>--threads and<br/> you aren&apos;t obliged to defend yourself.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m not obliged, I choose to.&nbsp; After 40+ hours of working on and fine-tuning a scale copying nothing from other scale...I feel I deserve to at least say what the scale is, how it&apos;s made, and what it&apos;s designed to do (regardless of if people think it achieves those goals or not).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Far as owning threads...of course I don&apos;t own them but, if I start a thread on a topic...it&apos;s at least somewhat reasonable to at least attempt to keep it on topic...even when the moderation is light.&nbsp; Again the &quot;de-railed thread&quot; issue.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--&quot;Informally, if somebody consistently acts like an idiot,<br/>--we&apos;re going to filter out your posts.

Michael&apos;s posts don&apos;t contain detailed explanations<br/>or answers to questions, but rather, they tend to contain<br/>rants and personal attacks.<br/>3. 1/4-comma meantone is the 5-limit minimax meantone.<br/>4. Meta-stable ratios might be of interest to Michael.<br/>5. I brought up Surreal numbers as a joke.<br/>6. Having a moderator filter posts is a better use of labor<br/>than having 1200 readers filter posts.</p><p>Of these points, only #5 is incorrect.  Now let&apos;s do the<br/>same for Michael&apos;s post:</p><p>1. He assumed I&apos;d made a joke at his expense.<br/>2. My explanation of what I actually meant &quot;reeks of bull crap&quot;.<br/>3. Surreal numbers are not real numbers.<br/>4. I&apos;d been trying to get him to use cents or fractions.<br/>5. I think the only valid ways to build a scale are to<br/>use the harmonic series or to stack tetrads.<br/>6. Michael strongly disagrees the methods in #5 are the only<br/>ways to make good scales.<br/>7. Michael understands 80% of the example I gave him, and boy<br/>was it a crap example.<br/>8. Michael challenges me to a chord beauty contest.</p><p>#1 assumes ill intent, though Graham seems to have read it<br/>this way also, so the misunderstanding was probably my fault.<br/>#2 rejects my attempt to clarify.  #3 is true but demonstrates<br/>he still hasn&apos;t understood the point, despite the clarification.<br/>#4 shows he missed when I explained that decimal ratios from<br/>his DAW are fine and that the only important thing is to share<br/>quantities of some sort.  #5 is an attempt at telepathy (and<br/>it&apos;s wrong).  #6 is attacking a straw man.  #7 construes an<br/>example I created to help clarify as an attack.</p><p>In light of this analysis, here&apos;s what I&apos;m thinking:</p><p>Michael, I&apos;m sorry we got to squabbling.  Can we put this<br/>behind us?  I believe you&apos;re someone who&apos;s seriously interested<br/>in microtonal music, and if so, you&apos;ve got something quite<br/>unusual in common with folks here.  Let&apos;s not waste that<br/>serendipity.  I don&apos;t care if you believe in JI or anything<br/>else, but if you want to be happy here, you&apos;ll have to be<br/>willing to do three things:</p><p>1. Please approach the list as a place to learn.  That&apos;s how<br/>I approach it, and I continue to learn new things here all<br/>the time.  This will take an ounce of humility, and it will<br/>go a long way.  If you make a claim and are challenged, don&apos;t<br/>be defensive.  Try to present evidence to support your claim.<br/>Ask as many questions as you like, but please don&apos;t swamp out<br/>answers with new text.  One can&apos;t learn and lecture at the<br/>same time!  (I&apos;ll be the first to admit I&apos;ve been guilty of<br/>this in years past.)</p><p>2. Please do share your listening adventures and experiences<br/>here.  When you do, simply tell us what you were playing<br/>(in cents or crow&apos;s feathers or whatever you like) so we can<br/>play along at home.</p><p>3. Start formatting your posts as requested.  You can look at<br/>Graham&apos;s post, discussed above, as a prime example of how to<br/>do it.  Yahoo&apos;s website should start you off with quoted text<br/>automatically, and most e-mail clients will do the same.<br/>It will also help to read the links I provided on the topic.</p><p>Are you willing to work on these points?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=82915 href="#82915">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2009 2:07:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Apr 16, 2009, at 6:50 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; Michael&apos;s post has 747 words.

As far as I know, Gene&apos;s definition of this term as an instance of a regular temperament is not established.

By contrast, this term is established among musicians as a generic term for arbitrary, well, tunings including regular temperaments but also anything else. For example, try googling &quot;tuning music&quot; and see what you get. Also, we are speaking of &quot;tuning&quot; an instrument and not of &quot;scaling&quot; it :)  Is there a problem to stick with convention and call what you call a &quot;scale&quot; instead a &quot;tuning&quot;, and so retain for both terms &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;tuning&quot; their conservative meaning?

Are they not  &gt; tunings?</p><p>Gene&apos;s definition was written in the context of regular temperaments.  A &quot;tuning&quot; in any context is a particular set of parameters for the given system.  For a regular &quot;temperament&quot; as Gene defined it (what I&apos;d call a &quot;temperament class&quot;) there are r free parameters for r generators, so the tuning is the particular choice for those generators.  For an instrument with a fixed number of notes, the tuning is the particular pitch given to each note.  For a string instrument the tuning is the pitch given to each open string.  In some contexts the tuning of an instrument or ensemble is the absolute reference pitch everything else is taken relative to.  I don&apos;t see any inherent confusion or controversy in any of this.</p><p>&gt; The term &quot;scale&quot; is problematic in that it is obviously used in  &gt; different meanings. Gene&apos;s (and Scala&apos;s) definition &quot;list of  &gt; intervals&quot; is one instance. By contrast, music theorists tend to use  &gt; this term in a more abstract sense, as just pointed out by Claudio.  &gt; It is a list of intervals which allows for considerable &quot;retuning&quot;  &gt; and still remains recognisable (e.g., &quot;major scale&quot; in 12 ET vs. 1/4- &gt; comma meantone).

The vague part is that it leaves the definition of &quot;pitch&quot; hanging.  With Gene&apos;s definition &quot;pitch&quot; is taken in its scientific sense, so it should have a particular value in Hz, which a musical &quot;pitch&quot; needn&apos;t.  That&apos;s why he talked about a &quot;list of intervals&quot; instead of &quot;list of pitches&quot; directly.  The intervals are like position vectors for the pitches.</p><p>In the abstract sense, a scale is a list of abstract pitches.  For example the C major scale is &quot;C D E F G A B C&quot;.  Here, the tuning (either absolute or relative pitch) isn&apos;t determined.  Gene&apos;s definition excludes this case.</p><p>If you take a scale from a regular temperament, then that scale can obviously be (re-)tuned according to the values for the generators and absolute pitch reference.  If you talk about &quot;the chromatic scale&quot; then it can be tuned by picking 12 less abstract pitches.  This is the general meaning and I don&apos;t see any confusion.</p><p>The Scala files are obviously of scales.  They&apos;re lists of pitches, defined as precise intervals relative to an undefined reference.  They&apos;re also tunings of an abstract scale with the same number of notes.

Whether the new extra note below A, apparently first<br/>mentioned by the author of the Dialogus, was added to account for new<br/>expanded chants, or whether, as seems possible, it was necessary to<br/>explain the lowest A and B within a hexachordal or tetrachordal<br/>system, is not at all clear. But from that time on nearly all<br/>descriptions of the scale or of the monochord began with the lowest<br/>note called gamma, gamma ut or gamma graecum. This also found its way<br/>into the vernacular: Tobler and Lommatzsch listed Gautier de Coincy&rsquo;s<br/>use of &lsquo;gama&uuml;t&rsquo;; English uses may be found in the Oxford English<br/>Dictionary and in Kurath and Kuhn.</p><p>(2) The hexachordal system or, more broadly, any system. Early uses<br/>in English seem to have taken the form &lsquo;gamme&rsquo;: at the end of the<br/>14th century John Gower wrote &lsquo;Nou hihe notes and nou lowe,/As be the<br/>gamme a man mei knowe,/Which techeth the prolacion/Of note and the<br/>condicion&rsquo;; and shortly afterwards Leonel Power began his work on<br/>discant: &lsquo;This tretis is contrived upon the gamme for them that will<br/>be syngers or makers or techers&rsquo;. From similar references listed in<br/>Kurath and Kuhn it seems that &lsquo;gamme&rsquo; meant &lsquo;hexachordal system&rsquo;.<br/>French uses of the word in that sense are plentiful and go back to Le<br/>roman de Th&egrave;bes (mid-12th century). More recently the French word<br/>gamme, like the Italian gamma, has been the normal word for a musical<br/>scale. From the end of the 15th century the word &lsquo;gamut&rsquo;, which is<br/>apparently peculiar to English, has meant &lsquo;hexachordal system&rsquo;,<br/>&lsquo;scale&rsquo; or &lsquo;system&rsquo;. See also Hexachord.</p><p>(3) Range. Strictly, the gamut in this sense comprised those notes<br/>shown on the Guidonian hand (see Solmization, figs.1 and 2). More loosely, and more often, it has been used figuratively.

An abstract tuning without exact pitch reference.<br/>&gt; &gt; If someone says &quot;C4&quot;, generally it&apos;s safe to assume they mean<br/>&gt; &gt; a pitch given A=440. There is the matter of transposing<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments, but in my experience one tends to say &quot;high C&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;middle C&quot; rather than C-number with those.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If they use the number, they may be thinking in terms of<br/>&gt; MIDI, which is where that terminology comes from.<br/>&gt;<br/>This is not true, it has nothing to do with MIDI, and MIDI uses these numbers in a different way then music theory (besides Yamaha assigning differs one octave from MIDI). In many languages numbers are used, usually as superscript (exponent) to note name. Note names are written in small character.<br/>&gt; In<br/>&gt; general -- whatever the definitions may say -- you can&apos;t<br/>&gt; assume either concert pitch or equal temperament. Or are<br/>&gt; you seriously suggesting it&apos;s impossible to play a C major<br/>&gt; scale on a piano tuned to A=445 or meantone?<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, this is possible, therefore scales and tunings don&apos;t need exact pitch reference for abstract work (creating...), but of course when used practically, some pitch reference is necessary. And there&apos;s no reason to use different one then A=440 (or 442).<br/>&gt; &gt; There&apos;s no consistent definition. The terms &quot;scale&quot;, &quot;mode&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; and &quot;gamut&quot; are all used more or less interchangeably. The<br/>&gt; &gt; proposed definition of &quot;scale&quot; is the most inclusive and<br/>&gt; &gt; therefore probably the best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There *are* consistent definitions of &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;mode&quot; in<br/>&gt; Renaissance counterpoint, and I think through to Common<br/>&gt; Practice. They are followed strictly by careful writers in<br/>&gt; that context.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, it&apos;s so.<br/>&gt; There are other definitions in other<br/>&gt; contexts,<br/>&gt;<br/>For example &quot;mode&quot; as a rotation, permutation of a scale (changing the root note). Or &quot;modal music&quot;, &quot;modal jazz&quot; etc.  I wouldn&apos;t add more to this terminological richness which is always clear from context.<br/>&gt; But note that my simple definition of &quot;a list of pitches&quot; doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; include scale types (like LLsLLLs)<br/>&gt;<br/>Why not?

I don&apos;t have it with me to check.  In general, the term is certainly used, but not only about a fixed set of notes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I said _a_ concert pitch.  It can be anything you like.<br/>&gt;&gt; Now you want to argue about definitions of &quot;concert pitch&quot; &gt;&gt; do you?  And anyway, you didn&apos;t, you said &quot;A=440&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; I said that in reference to scientific pitch notation.<br/>&gt; Here I said it doesn&apos;t matter much whether scale is defined<br/>&gt; on pitches or intervals, since a concert pitch can get you<br/>&gt; from one to the other.  Ozan used to use the term &quot;diapason&quot;<br/>&gt; here.  Pick whatever you like.  I think Scala calls it<br/>&gt; &quot;base frequency&quot;.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t talking about scientific pitch notation.  I was specifically talking about the difference between the word &quot;pitch&quot; in scientific and musical contexts.  That&apos;s a distinction that&apos;s still passing you by.  A concert pitch will not get you from the musical definition (that I intended) to the scientific one.</p><p>Now, it certainly isn&apos;t as simple as that.  And as this is the most likely point of confusion, let&apos;s talk about it again, instead of wandering off into scientific pitch, absolute pitch, and so on.</p><p>When I started checking definitions, I found that they generally didn&apos;t make the distinction I did.  For example, here&apos;s the Lilypond Music Glossary:</p><p>&quot;ES: altura, I: altezza, F: hauteur, D: Tonh&iuml;&iquest;&half;he, NL: toonhoogte, DK: toneh&iuml;&iquest;&half;jde, S: tonh&iuml;&iquest;&half;jd, FI: s&iuml;&iquest;&half;velkorkeus.</p><p>&quot;   1. The perceived quality of a sound that is primarily a function of its fundamental frequency.<br/>   2. [FR. ton; DE. Ton; ES. tono] Any point on the continuum of musical pitch.<br/>   3. [FR. diapason; DE. Kammerton, Stimmung; ES. diapas&iuml;&iquest;&half;n] The standardized association of a particular frequency with a particular pitch name, e.g., c&iuml;&iquest;&half; = 256 Hz.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/music-glossary/pitch#pitch">http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/music-glossary/pitch#pitch</a></p><p>Note: three different meanings corresponding to four different words in German.  &quot;Concert pitch&quot; and tuning refer to [3] which looks like scientific pitch.  Probably the pitches in a scale are [2].  This definition doesn&apos;t specify a precise value in Hz.</p><p>General dictionaries tend to distinguish &quot;acoustic&quot; from &quot;musical&quot; meanings:</p><p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/dic?q=pitch">http://dictionary.reference.com/dic?q=pitch</a></p><p>There&apos;s a good description from Webster&apos;s:</p><p>&quot;(Mus.) The relative acuteness or gravity of a tone, determined by the number of vibrations which produce it; the place of any tone upon a scale of high and low.</p><p>&quot;Note: Musical tones with reference to absolute pitch, are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet; with reference to relative pitch, in a series of tones called the scale, they are called one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight is also one of a new scale an octave higher, as one is eight of a scale an octave lower.&quot;</p><p>This tells us that letters of the alphabet refer to pitches, and that a scale is made of *relative* pitches.</p><p>Here&apos;s a website that came up relative to that:</p><p><a href="http://emusician.com/tutorials/emusic_pitch_vs_frequency/">http://emusician.com/tutorials/emusic_pitch_vs_frequency/</a></p><p>It says &quot;One key distinction between these terms is that pitch is relative (a matter of common agreement among musicians), while frequency is absolute (a precise, unambiguous measurement).&quot;  I disagree in that there *is* a precise, unambiguous &quot;pitch&quot; used in acoustics.  Still, what it implies is that &quot;pitch&quot; as used in music is imprecise and ambiguous.  Hence &quot;a matter of common agreement&quot;.</p><p>No definition I can find makes it clear what the word &quot;pitch&quot; refers to when we say that the first seven letters of the alphabet are pitch names.  Some musicians may sincerely believe that these letters refer to precise, unambiguous, scientific pitches.  Still, we know that with all the imprecision of orchestral performance and the variety of tuning systems used throughout history, this musical concept of pitch has to be a lot less precise than that.</p><p>For our purposes we often have to tie down the imprecision of these pitches.  Some microtonal composers will specify the exact tuning for a piece, and in those cases musical pitch defaults to scientific pitch (sometimes not absolute).   Sometimes, especially with regular temperaments, the mathematics will define certain tuning systems as being inside the temperament (class).  The precise tuning of a written pitch could follow any of those tunings.  So if a scale contains pitches, they maybe scientific pitches with an arbitrary reference -- like Scala files -- or interval patterns like &quot;LLsLLLs&quot;.  The novelty is in our understanding of &quot;pitch&quot;.</p><p>If you like you could come up with different terms for different kinds of pitch.  I don&apos;t know any in English.</p><p>So, in summary, a scale is still a list of pitches or pitch classes in ascending or descending order.  Going from &quot;the C major scale&quot; to &quot;the major scale&quot; means switching to relative pitch.  Your objection (in another message) that &quot;the tuning could vary, and it&apos;d still be C major&quot; doesn&apos;t apply to the practical musical concept of &quot;pitch&quot;.

With only one comma in the 5-limit, you<br/>have a periodicity sheet -- add one more to get a block.<br/>The additional criterion of being &quot;epimorphic&quot; is usually<br/>put to periodicity blocks also -- though sometimes such<br/>blocks are specially identified as &quot;epimorphic blocks&quot; or<br/>&quot;Fokker blocks&quot;.  As long as the commas are smaller than<br/>the smallest 2nd in the block, I think you get epimorphism.<br/>Basically, epimorphism means the block is a bona fide<br/>detempering of a regular temperament -- there is a val for<br/>the block that sends intervals to scale degrees (e.g. 5:4<br/>is always a 3rd if the pitch classes in the block are<br/>treated as a scale).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=83044 href="#83044">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2009 1:58:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 19 Apr 2009, at 3:11 PM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Klaus Schmirler &lt;KSchmir@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Daniel was talking about French and some other languages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think was talking about English.

We don&apos;t call a 5/4 approximation in 12-ET a &quot;fifth&quot; just because it&apos;s a 4-step interval; it&apos;s still a &quot;major third&quot;. As such, the word &quot;third&quot; (as the name of a musical interval) has lost much of the association it once had with the number three (even more so the &quot;octave&quot;, which comes from a Latin word for &quot;eight&quot;). Besides, if you&apos;re using a set of pitches with 72 notes to the octave, do you really want to call an approximate 5:4 a 24th?

Seven-tone  &gt; scale has seven modes.<br/>&gt; &gt; Then of course we have another using of both terms in common  &gt; practice, when &quot;mode&quot; means the same as a &quot;scale&quot; (historical modes,  &gt; Messiaen modes of limited transpositions, ethnic modes...). As this  &gt; doubling is unnecessary and confusing in the world of microtonal  &gt; music, we should use a term &quot;mode&quot; only as a permutation of a scale.  &gt; In that sense it will be like an additional explanatory term of the  &gt; scale, if necessary, and without direct connection to  &gt; &quot;tuning&quot; (tuning -&gt; scale -&gt; mode).</p><p>I think this is a reasonable way to make the distinction between &quot;scales&quot; and &quot;modes&quot; in general. In some cases there may be a modal relationship between two scales; e.g. Vincent Persichetti labels the &quot;Hungarian Minor&quot; scale as the &quot;4th mode&quot; of the &quot;Double Harmonic&quot; scale.

You could treat it as a special case of a natural minor scale with a couple of extra notes that are used in specific contexts, but those &quot;extra&quot; notes are surely as much a part of the scale as the regular notes, if we want to call this thing a &quot;scale&quot;.</p><p>Then you get into things like the pelog scale in Indonesian music, one version of which has 7 pitches, from which 5-note subsets (in English often called &quot;modes&quot;) are used. If you take the whole set of 7 notes as a &quot;scale&quot;, you need to account for the fact that 2 of the notes in the scale (depending on the mode) are rarely used.

Sometimes one distinction between a &quot;mode&quot; and a &quot;scale&quot; is that a scale is ordered but a mode isn&apos;t.  So a &quot;mode&quot; is the *set* of pitches that occur in a scale, not a list if you take a list to have an order.</p><p>(I say that a list does have an order.  A list of your favorite drummers will usually have your bestest favorite at the top.  A shopping list is always written down in order even if that order isn&apos;t important.  A set is a mathematical concept that&apos;s specifically defined so that (by default) it doesn&apos;t have an order.)</p><p>Usually a mode will also have some notes singled out as &quot;tonic&quot; or &quot;dominant&quot; or whatever.  And some rules for how to form cadences.  Maybe some standard melodic patterns.  A lot depends on the music being studied.  Medieval modes are not the same as Renaissance modes but sometimes definitions try to cover both.</p><p>Scales are usually defined in terms of one octave, but treated so that they repeat in some sense.  The distinction has nothing to do with scales that cover more than an octave without repeating.</p><p>The Common Practice equivalent of a mode is a key.  The modes evolved into two distinct types: major and minor. Keys retain some features of modes but have other, novel properties.  An Indian rag or Arab/Persian/Turkish/etc ma[qk]am is a related concept.  Indian theories also have &quot;that&quot; or &quot;mela&quot; for a scale or set of notes.</p><p>A minor key has both ascending and descending scales, or one scale with both forms.  This is where the order is important.  Whatever it has to do with music, &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; are not the same.  It&apos;s a property that applies to scales, not modes, according to this distinction.</p><p>There&apos;s also a sense, probably most common these days, in which &quot;the modes&quot; are different scales taken as cyclic permutations of the major scale.  This can apply to jazz, rock, or folk.  There are plenty of references you&apos;ll find that talk about modes as being scales, or generally mix the concepts up.  But others where the terms really are distinct, so you&apos;ll hear of &quot;the major mode&quot; or &quot;the dorian scale&quot; where appropriate.

A scale is, much like every other source,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;a set of related notes placed in ascending or descending<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; order by pitch&quot;. Then, a &quot;mode is a set of such notes in<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the context of the conventional patterns for relating them&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; mode = set<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; scale = ordered set<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m still a bit confused about the distinction here. Would the<br/>&gt; &gt; distinction only apply for scales that don&apos;t repeat at the octave? &gt; The<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;modal&quot; version simply being the list of all pitches that occur in &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; scale, and the &quot;scale&quot; version being specifically where they occur<br/>&gt; &gt; (aka this pitch doesn&apos;t occur until the second octave, this pitch &gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; until the third octave, etc.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are different definitions of &quot;mode&quot;. Sometimes one<br/>&gt; distinction between a &quot;mode&quot; and a &quot;scale&quot; is that a scale<br/>&gt; is ordered but a mode isn&apos;t. So a &quot;mode&quot; is the *set* of<br/>&gt; pitches that occur in a scale, not a list if you take a list<br/>&gt; to have an order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I say that a list does have an order. A list of your<br/>&gt; favorite drummers will usually have your bestest favorite at<br/>&gt; the top. A shopping list is always written down in order<br/>&gt; even if that order isn&apos;t important. A set is a mathematical<br/>&gt; concept that&apos;s specifically defined so that (by default) it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have an order.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Usually a mode will also have some notes singled out as<br/>&gt; &quot;tonic&quot; or &quot;dominant&quot; or whatever. And some rules for how<br/>&gt; to form cadences. Maybe some standard melodic patterns. A<br/>&gt; lot depends on the music being studied. Medieval modes are<br/>&gt; not the same as Renaissance modes but sometimes definitions<br/>&gt; try to cover both.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scales are usually defined in terms of one octave, but<br/>&gt; treated so that they repeat in some sense. The distinction<br/>&gt; has nothing to do with scales that cover more than an octave<br/>&gt; without repeating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Common Practice equivalent of a mode is a key. The<br/>&gt; modes evolved into two distinct types: major and minor.<br/>&gt; Keys retain some features of modes but have other, novel<br/>&gt; properties. An Indian rag or Arab/Persian/Turkish/etc<br/>&gt; ma[qk]am is a related concept. Indian theories also have<br/>&gt; &quot;that&quot; or &quot;mela&quot; for a scale or set of notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A minor key has both ascending and descending scales, or one<br/>&gt; scale with both forms. This is where the order is<br/>&gt; important. Whatever it has to do with music, &quot;ascending&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;descending&quot; are not the same. It&apos;s a property that<br/>&gt; applies to scales, not modes, according to this distinction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s also a sense, probably most common these days, in<br/>&gt; which &quot;the modes&quot; are different scales taken as cyclic<br/>&gt; permutations of the major scale. This can apply to jazz,<br/>&gt; rock, or folk. There are plenty of references you&apos;ll find<br/>&gt; that talk about modes as being scales, or generally mix the<br/>&gt; concepts up. But others where the terms really are<br/>&gt; distinct, so you&apos;ll hear of &quot;the major mode&quot; or &quot;the dorian<br/>&gt; scale&quot; where appropriate. Different schools generally won&apos;t<br/>&gt; refer to each other, try to be consistent with each other,<br/>&gt; or even be aware of each other&apos;s existence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are studying music, aren&apos;t you?

There are the modes of the melodic minor<br/>scale, there are the modes of harmonic minor, of harmonic major, etc.</p><p>However, there is also the concept of a piece being in major/minor<br/>mode etc. It refers to the basic pitch set that forms sort of the<br/>background &quot;harmonic vibe&quot; of the piece. This often assumes octave<br/>equivalence, but there are a few cases I&apos;ve found where octave<br/>equivalence doesn&apos;t quite work. And I&apos;m glad you&apos;re using that<br/>definition of mode, because that&apos;s how I always felt about it - in a<br/>sense, they are the &quot;modes&quot; that a piece of music can exist in. I<br/>remember throwing this definition of mode around a while ago and<br/>someone objected to it, and I&apos;m not sure why.</p><p>My definition of a &quot;mode&quot; is also something that a piece of music can<br/>be &quot;in.&quot; That is, a piece can be in major mode, minor mode, dorian<br/>mode, lydian #2, etc. And, I find, for almost any mode, you can find<br/>chords that will make you expect some other chord to follow, or chords<br/>that naturally seem to follow other chords - even modes besides the<br/>usual major/minor pairing around here. That effectively means that<br/>so-called &quot;functional&quot; harmony exists in more modes than major and<br/>minor, and that assertion was met with some objection around here.</p><p>Would you say that fits outside of the scope of your &quot;unordered pitch<br/>set&quot; definition?</p><p>&gt; You are studying music, aren&apos;t you? Or have recently<br/>&gt; finished doing so? Try checking either your notes or a book<br/>&gt; like Jeppesen&apos;s on counterpoint (in translation).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m really not making this up. Jon Szanto, I think, first<br/>&gt; pointed it out to me on this very list a few years ago. You<br/>&gt; should know a lot more than I do about it ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham</p><p>Haha... I wish my school talked about things like &quot;unordered pitch<br/>sets&quot; and &quot;rank-scale matrices.&quot; Nonetheless, to attempt seriously to<br/>understand something like music theory, you need to sit with it for a<br/>while and sort it out personally (as you are no doubt well aware).<br/>That means that while the teachers at my school are good for<br/>introducing new concepts or ideas, believing their words to be gospel<br/>is usually unwise. It doesn&apos;t help that they often say things that<br/>just seem generally wrong.</p><p>For example, the concept of Rothenberg propriety around here has<br/>somehow turned into that &quot;you can&apos;t have a scale with two half steps<br/>next to each other.&quot; Harmonies with minor ninths that aren&apos;t placed<br/>over the root are deemed &quot;invalid.&quot; And as to whether a piece can<br/>really be in dorian mode or if such a piece would just be in minor<br/>with a bunch of borrowed chords, it depends on who you ask. What I<br/>find is that the more I just stick to my observations and plowing<br/>ahead, the more I find that the people who wrote  these groundbreaking<br/>seminal theory works tend to agree with my observations anyway and<br/>that my teachers are just bastardizing the concepts slightly.</p><p>So nobody in my school can really agree on what anything is called and<br/>what is and isn&apos;t &quot;legal&quot; or fits into the definition of anything. I<br/>just change the terminology as needed to communicate with people. If<br/>the pitch set of a piece that is residing in the back of your mind is<br/>called a &quot;mode,&quot; I&apos;m happy with that. And if nobody wants to give<br/>chord expectations in Dorian and Mixolydian the title of &quot;functional<br/>harmony,&quot; that&apos;s fine too. But, for the record, I&apos;m glad you chose the<br/>definition of &quot;mode&quot; that you did, because I&apos;d always felt like that<br/>definition worked particularly well.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=83103 href="#83103">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2009 3:39:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I always thought Lydian, Ionian and Mixolydian are considered as major (in this order from the most major to less major sounding), Dorian, Aeolian and Phrygian minor (in this order from less minor to the most minor), Locrian is a special case with its diminished fifth.</p><p>I have prepared this explanation many years ago for my students using a general D scale:</p><p>D E F G A B C</p><p>(because of symmetry on the piano keyboard).

The distinction generally becomes useful when one<br/>refers to nonlinearities in pitch perception, i.e. that low<br/>frequencies tend to be perceived as having a &quot;sharper&quot; tone chroma<br/>than their equivalents a few octaves up, and that octaves of pure<br/>tones in the upper register won&apos;t sound pure unless they are<br/>considerably sharp.</p><p>&gt; 3) C&apos; can be played at different exact, scientific pitches<br/>&gt; in different contexts, even on the same instrument in the<br/>&gt; same performance of the same piece of music.<br/>//<br/>&gt; 8) The pitches a scale contains need not be exact.</p><p>I strongly agree with this. This same line of reasoning led to the<br/>post I made above about defining the {1/1 9/8 5/4 ... | 81/80}<br/>structure. It sure beats defining the major scale as 12-tet C D E F G<br/>A B C.</p><p>I also strongly agree with Carl that the definition of a &quot;scale&quot;<br/>should not be tied into a specific tuning. And Rothenberg&apos;s concept<br/>about hearing all different types of ZZYZZZY as being the major scale<br/>is right on. But what about the fact that people don&apos;t usually really<br/>hear comma shifted intervals as containing unique identities in a<br/>scale or mode? They&apos;re usually instead swallowed up by their<br/>archetypal neighbors. For example, Tom Dent posted a harpsichord<br/>recording of I think God Save the Queen that uses both 9/8 and 10/9 in<br/>a way in which you would never know a comma shift had occurred unless<br/>you were specifically listening for it. The two intervals were in<br/>different registers at different times.</p><p>The concept of the &quot;major scale&quot; ought to be defined in a way that<br/>encapsulates a number of different tuning systems. But to say the<br/>major scale is fundamentally something like &quot;LLsLLLs&quot; isn&apos;t abstract<br/>enough. The meantone major scale and the JI major scale would have to<br/>have fundamentally different definitions, and if the goal is to have<br/>the definition of &quot;scale&quot; be abstract enough to incorporate different<br/>entities, we might as well make it abstract enough to incorporate both<br/>of them.</p><p>That being said, it would be nice if there were some way to formalize<br/>this so that we didn&apos;t really need to have both LLsLLLs and LIsLILs to<br/>represent often barely perceptible comma shifts (especially from a<br/>melodic standpoint). If we&apos;re trying to get the root definition of<br/>&quot;scale&quot; abstract enough to where it represents a perceptual feature<br/>rather than a scientifically quantifiable set of cents or intervals,<br/>we might as well go all the way with it, in my opinion.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=83106 href="#83106">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2009 4:10:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I tend to avoid the terms diminished and augmented, when referring to intervals, as they come from the ambiguous use by classical chauvanists;</p><p>although I do use the terms for chords : e.g. C-Eb-Gb is Cdim chord.

That effectively means that<br/>&gt; so-called &quot;functional&quot; harmony exists in more modes than major and<br/>&gt; minor, and that assertion was met with some objection around here.<br/>&gt;<br/>If you find in the mode the most natural chord sequences, which<br/>harmonize the modal melody properly, that means you use modal<br/>harmony, as functional harmony goes against the natural features of<br/>those modes. For example mixolydian minor dominant chord. It has<br/>nothing to do with functional harmony. Opposite when you will use<br/>chromatic relations and altered chords, they are foreign to the mode.</p><p>Of course it&apos;s possible to harmonize modal melody with functional<br/>harmony, or even with high ratio of chromatism, borrowed chords,<br/>polyharmony, quartal harmony, triadic-quartal, jazz etc. But then you<br/>go against the spirit of mode, against its latent harmony.</p><p>As a good examples of both attitudes I can recommend you to study the<br/>attitude of different authors when they do accompaniment for folklore<br/>songs (which are usually in such or more exotic modes). I have verygood examples from Czech music.</p><p>Leo&scaron; Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek was a specialist in Moravian ethnic music, fully<br/>understood a difference between functional and modal harmony (which<br/>is clearly to hear even from his autonome works), so his<br/>harmonizations of folklore are exactly as it should be, far from<br/>functional harmony. Very often he uses no chords, only sustained note<br/>or fifth drones, tried to imitate zymbalon way of accompaniment, orspecial bow techniques used by string performers. A revelation.</p><p>The same good in this was Hungarian B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k, also a great<br/>ethnomusicologist, who learned a lot from ethnic music. He used even<br/>older modal harmony then Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek (as he was inspired additionally by<br/>old European music), on the other side he was not afraid to use<br/>quartal harmony, and more pentatonics than Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek (because there&apos;s<br/>no pentatonics in Indo-European Czech and Moravian original songs,<br/>but Hungarian music is of Asian origin and full of pentatonics).</p><p>And now a bad example: Czech Late-romantic composer  V&iacute;t&ecaron;zslav<br/>Nov&aacute;k did many harmonizations of Czech, Moravian and Slovakian songs,<br/>but not in a modal harmony, but in rich functional harmony. He used<br/>high triadic chords with many alterations, chromatic chords,<br/>impresionistic whole-tone chords, complex modulations and tonal<br/>jumps, double dominants and New-Hungarian urban sequences of<br/>diminished chords (which was over-used by Gipsy musicians in Carpathian from Balcan to middle Europe) for simple folklore modal<br/>songs (some of them very old, in Byzantinian style), and very heavy<br/>and dense virtuoso piano stylization and this way he managed to<br/>destroy totally their latent fragile and exotic beauty. He totally<br/>misunderstood for example some unusual chromatic notes and flections<br/>in modal melodies, and harmonized them as a part of standard<br/>chromatic scale.<br/>I didn&apos;t say he was a bad composer, not at all, in his own style he<br/>has some good works (not my cup of Starbucks), but he was totally<br/>unsensitive and tasteless concerning folklore.</p><p>So you can see two different attitudes, one very humble, sensitive,<br/>and protective, with a desire to learn something from it, to these old folk treasures, and another one aggressive, tasteless, equalizing<br/>everything into one uniform style...</p><p>Worth of study, you can learn a lot from all this. Oh yes, it&apos;s never<br/>too late to start with some very interesting places in Chopin,<br/>continue through Russian composers starting with Mussorgski until<br/>Stravinski (you can omit two great composers - Scriabin and<br/>Rachmaninoff, first was quite original, second one Late-romantic,<br/>both without any relation to folklore and modal music in the sense we<br/>are talking about), nothing against Part.

Do you have any<br/>&gt;&gt; evidence to back it up?<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you saying that names such as &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot; are simply relative<br/>&gt; terms indicating the place you&apos;re at in a scale, or that somehow<br/>&gt; &quot;pitch&quot; itself is relative?</p><p>I wasn&apos;t saying anything there.  I was quoting the Electronic Musician website.  But what I&apos;m generally saying, since you ask, is that names such as &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot; are names of pitches.  Whatever quantity they name must be pitch.</p><p>They certainly aren&apos;t relative pitch, which is a different thing entirely, and in this context may be what jianpu or solfege describes.  If you accept that, &quot;the major scale&quot; is a list of relative pitches.</p><p>(Incidentally, the answer to Carl&apos;s riddle in another message, is abgngrq cvgpu.  That&apos;s in rot-13 so I don&apos;t give the game away for those of you still puzzling over it.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; In psychoacoustics.<br/>&gt;&gt; All the dictionaries I could find say acoustics.<br/>&gt; &gt; The way I learned it, pitch is a purely psychoacoustic percept (try<br/>&gt; saying that five times fast) and frequency is an absolute and<br/>&gt; scientific quantity. The distinction generally becomes useful when one<br/>&gt; refers to nonlinearities in pitch perception, i.e. that low<br/>&gt; frequencies tend to be perceived as having a &quot;sharper&quot; tone chroma<br/>&gt; than their equivalents a few octaves up, and that octaves of pure<br/>&gt; tones in the upper register won&apos;t sound pure unless they are<br/>&gt; considerably sharp.</p><p>I checked dictionaries, and they said that &quot;pitch&quot; has different meanings in acoustics and music.  The acoustics one is a subjective quantity, and you can call that psychoacoustics if you want.  It&apos;s still a science.  This sense is used in music, as in &quot;concert pitch&quot;, but isn&apos;t the only sense.  Which leads us to:</p><p>&gt;&gt; 3) C&apos; can be played at different exact, scientific pitches<br/>&gt;&gt; in different contexts, even on the same instrument in the<br/>&gt;&gt; same performance of the same piece of music.<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt;&gt; 8) The pitches a scale contains need not be exact.<br/>&gt; &gt; I strongly agree with this. This same line of reasoning led to the<br/>&gt; post I made above about defining the {1/1 9/8 5/4 ... | 81/80}<br/>&gt; structure. It sure beats defining the major scale as 12-tet C D E F G<br/>&gt; A B C.</p><p>That&apos;s good.  That&apos;s the main thing I&apos;ve been arguing.</p><p>&gt; I also strongly agree with Carl that the definition of a &quot;scale&quot;<br/>&gt; should not be tied into a specific tuning. And Rothenberg&apos;s concept<br/>&gt; about hearing all different types of ZZYZZZY as being the major scale<br/>&gt; is right on. But what about the fact that people don&apos;t usually really<br/>&gt; hear comma shifted intervals as containing unique identities in a<br/>&gt; scale or mode? They&apos;re usually instead swallowed up by their<br/>&gt; archetypal neighbors. For example, Tom Dent posted a harpsichord<br/>&gt; recording of I think God Save the Queen that uses both 9/8 and 10/9 in<br/>&gt; a way in which you would never know a comma shift had occurred unless<br/>&gt; you were specifically listening for it. The two intervals were in<br/>&gt; different registers at different times.</p><p>Major scales with 9/8 and 10/9 would be equivalence classes by Rothenberg&apos;s definition.  No problem there.   What I worry about is that 12-tet would be the cut-off point between one equivalence class and another.  In equal temperament, F-Bb and Bb-F are the same interval, and hence equivalent, so the scale is proper rather than strictly proper.  Rothenberg&apos;s ordering is subjective, so a miniscule de-tuning doesn&apos;t change the equivalence class.  But the further down you go in the meantone direction, the more likely those tritones will be heard as distinct, so that the scale becomes strictly proper.  As such it&apos;s a different equivalence class and so both couldn&apos;t be &quot;the major scale&quot;.</p><p>You can say that&apos;s fine.  It means something.  But I wouldn&apos;t take it as *the* definition of &quot;the same scale&quot;.  I want to talk about major scales in the whole range of meantones from 12 to 19 -- and I&apos;ve done so for many years.</p><p>&gt; The concept of the &quot;major scale&quot; ought to be defined in a way that<br/>&gt; encapsulates a number of different tuning systems. But to say the<br/>&gt; major scale is fundamentally something like &quot;LLsLLLs&quot; isn&apos;t abstract<br/>&gt; enough. The meantone major scale and the JI major scale would have to<br/>&gt; have fundamentally different definitions, and if the goal is to have<br/>&gt; the definition of &quot;scale&quot; be abstract enough to incorporate different<br/>&gt; entities, we might as well make it abstract enough to incorporate both<br/>&gt; of them.</p><p>The meantone major scale is something like &quot;LLsLLLs&quot;.  It has exactly the right degree of abstraction if what you want to talk about is major scales in arbitrary meantone tunings.   Yes, the concept of &quot;scale&quot; should cover both it and JI (fixed and adaptive) and other things like expressive intonation and a degree of unintentional mis-tuning.</p><p>What I&apos;ve suggested is that the definition of &quot;scale&quot; delegates this abstraction to the definition of &quot;pitches&quot;. That way you can talk about scales at different levels of abstraction by defining them according to different pitch systems.  (&quot;Pitch system&quot; is a term I&apos;ve used before.)</p><p>Maybe somebody can come up with a better word than &quot;pitches&quot;.  It&apos;s only recently I&apos;ve concluded that &quot;pitch&quot; is the proper musical term and I don&apos;t particularly like it.   Definitions may say &quot;notes&quot; or &quot;tones&quot; but the cascade of definitions always leads us to &quot;pitches&quot;.</p><p>&gt; That being said, it would be nice if there were some way to formalize<br/>&gt; this so that we didn&apos;t really need to have both LLsLLLs and LIsLILs to<br/>&gt; represent often barely perceptible comma shifts (especially from a<br/>&gt; melodic standpoint). If we&apos;re trying to get the root definition of<br/>&gt; &quot;scale&quot; abstract enough to where it represents a perceptual feature<br/>&gt; rather than a scientifically quantifiable set of cents or intervals,<br/>&gt; we might as well go all the way with it, in my opinion.</p><p>I want &quot;scale&quot; to be abstract enough to do what I want. That isn&apos;t always perceptual.  And neither is what you&apos;re talking about with {1/1 9/8 5/4 ... | 81/80} above.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=83115 href="#83115">ðŸ”—</a>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2009 5:13:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I tend to avoid the terms diminished and augmented, when referring to<br/>&gt; intervals, as they come from the ambiguous use by classical chauvanists; ...<br/>&gt; Using flat and sharp and multiple sharps and flats is much easier to<br/>&gt; use, and understand.<br/>&gt; It is also unambiguous, as it works for all keys, and interval sizes<br/>&gt; are clearly named without stating or needing to know the key.</p><p>Surely this is true of the classical terminology too, e.g. Daniel&apos;s example:</p><p>&gt; &gt; - diminished: C - Ebb<br/>&gt; &gt; - minor: C - Eb<br/>&gt; &gt; - major: C - E<br/>&gt; &gt; - augmented: C - E#</p><p>or this one:</p><p>- diminished: D-Fb<br/>- minor: D-F<br/>- major: D-F#<br/>- augmented: D-F##</p><p>&gt; The use of sharps and flats when describing intervals should be<br/>&gt; consistent whether you are using a sharp, flat or neutral key. ...</p><p>I don&apos;t see how this can be achieved at the same time as naming the interval sizes unambiguously (but I may have misunderstood you).</p><p>Steve M.</p></div><h3><a id=83116 href="#83116">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2009 5:32:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I worry about is that 12-tet would be the cut-off point<br/>&gt; between one equivalence class and another.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s a problem, but I don&apos;t see how to resolve it<br/>without getting pretty fancy.</p><p>&gt; It means something.</p><p>A considerable advantage.</p><p>&gt; But I wouldn&apos;t take it as *the* definition of &quot;the same scale&quot;.<br/>&gt; I want to talk about major scales in the whole range of<br/>&gt; meantones from 12 to 19 -- and I&apos;ve done so for many years.</p><p>Very well.

Well, maybe this concept is okay for someone who doesn&apos;t feel comfortable in reading sheet music, but using the term &quot;sharp&quot; somehow implies there should be some &quot;sharp&quot; accidentals, and the same goes for flats. You can&apos;t say that G#-A is a &quot;flat second&quot; because it doesn&apos;t have an A flat nor a G flat in it.

Such tetrachordal theory and compositional thinking is very good, I like it as well and did some research about tetrachords many years ago in those directions:</p><p>- to invent new types of tetrachords: I have realized that Lydian (C D E F#) and some other tetrachords (like C D Eb F#, C Db E F#) have an ambitus of 6 half-tones, and the most &quot;compressed&quot; one can have only 4 half-tones (C Db Ebb Fbb), so I tried to find all possible tetrachords with using of double accidentals and allowing the biggest interval between two adjacent steps 4 half-tones. I got 20 tetrachords (8 of them have names and are in use).</p><p>- to combine two  tetrachords into the modes closed into the octave: connection interval can be 0 to 4, it gives 2000 modes, but lot of them don&apos;t close into octave, after their cancelling there&apos;s still enough modes. I can exclude also tetrachords where two adjacent intervals are the same , and try to use only such connection intervals which are different than both edge intervals, and try to connect only various intervals when connecting interval is 0. Target is to have only modes where adjacent intervals are always different. Even with such strict rules I could get a lot of interesting modes. It&apos;s quite universal theory.</p><p>- to chain more then two tetrachords and create modes closed into the other intervals bigger then octave. This was the most promising part of research.</p><p>I was caught in all this modal staff after my study of old Greek music, Byzantinian music, Gregorian chant, maqam and raga. I wanted to keep some connection with these old styles but tried to shift them into the world of contemporary music thinking... I think still lot of this is a part of my compositional style despite the fact later I have started to work with more refined intervallic techniques inside the modes after I had realized the intervals are more important than scales.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 20 Apr 2009, at 11:08 PM, Cameron Bobro wrote:<br/>&gt; I think in terms of tetrachords (and pentachords, hemioctachords). &gt; So &quot;purely minor&quot; for me is Dorian, or &quot;minor-minor&quot; as it is in my &gt; old Bulgarian theory book, whereas Aeolian would be minor-phrygian.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Obviously this smells a whole lot like maqam theory as well as an &gt; ancient practical singer&apos;s approach, but I&apos;ll keep quiet about that.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83126 href="#83126">ðŸ”—</a>Claudio Di Veroli &#x3C;dvc@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2009 9:07:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles Lucy wrote:<br/>&gt; This leads us on the fact that wind instruments are usually easier to play<br/>in flat keys, as also are keyboards; whereas strings, guitars, etc are<br/>easier to play in sharp keys, because the open string tunings are on the<br/>sharp side of C in the circle/spiral of fourths/fifths.</p><p>Fully agree with brass instruments, most on the flats side, some of them<br/>heavily (band instruments in Bb and Eb).<br/>A few are not (natural brass in D and E).</p><p>For woodwinds only Clarinets in Bb are really on the flats, Clarinets in A<br/>and the other woodwinds are relatively neutral.</p><p>Guitars, violins, double bass: fully agree, their open strings are nearer to<br/>the sharps.<br/>Cello and viola: they are nearer to the flats.<br/>But the &quot;tendency&quot; is anyway slight.</p><p>As for keyboards, I never noticed any tendency towards the flats as you<br/>state:<br/>- from a technique point of view the thing is symmetrical<br/>- from the point of view of historical temperaments they are also mostly<br/>symmetrical, with a slight tendency of French circular (modified meantone)<br/>to favour the sharps, German circular (&quot;wohltemperierte&quot;) to favour the<br/>flats, but the tendency is really a minor one.<br/>Glad to hear your point of view re this last topic in more detail.</p><p>Claudio</p><p><a href="http://temper.braybaroque.ie/">http://temper.braybaroque.ie/</a></p></div><h3><a id=83129 href="#83129">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2009 11:54:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; 8) The pitches a scale contains need not be exact.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I strongly agree with this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ask any musician if the C on a Bb horn and the C on a<br/>&gt; piano are the same pitch.

(Had never thought about this before!)</p><p>With music and playing techniques from mid-18th century on, you may be<br/>right.</p><p>With prior music and techniques, things are different:<br/>1. FINGERING SCALES:  Fingering was asymmetrical. with Baroque fingerings<br/>the r.h. plays ascending scales easier with flats, but descending ones<br/>easier with sharps.<br/>The l.h. plays descending scales easier with sharps, and the ascending ones<br/>(with the thumb) have the same difficulty with sharps or flats. So the<br/>balance, if anything, favours slightly the sharps.</p><p>2. CHORDS: Pre-classical keyboard technique avoids thumbs and little fingers<br/>on accidentals.<br/>Thus large chords in major G, D, A, E and B (5 sharps) are fine, but to play<br/>even B flat (2 flats) is a problem.

So with your thinking if a note is already flattened<br/>&gt; by the key signature e.g. Bb, if you wished to flatten it to Bbb, you would add a flat<br/>&gt; to the notation of an already flattened B to indicate Bbb.<br/>&gt; How would you notate an A# to be played in a piece for which your key signature is Bb<br/>&gt; (i.e. 2 flats signs in the key signature)?</p><p>My goodness, I wasn&rsquo;t saying you couldn&rsquo;t mix altered notes on the same stave -- and I&rsquo;m not sure why you thought I was. Of course you can, why could you not? I was talking about something completely different, which was the fact that while the terms &bdquo;sharp&ldquo; and &bdquo;flat&ldquo; usually describe chromatic alterations of pitches (namely of those with no accidentals), you seem to be using the same words to describe chromatic alterations of intervals, not pitches (without providing a clear explanation what intervals are the &bdquo;unaltered&ldquo; ones which you can alter by adding a &bdquo;sharp&ldquo; or &bdquo;flat&ldquo; to them). But this means that now there are two different meanings for &bdquo;sharp&ldquo; and &bdquo;flat&ldquo; and it&rsquo;s not clear when we should understand them in one way and when in the other. So if you say to me &bdquo;play a flat fifth&ldquo;, I would assume you want me to use some &bdquo;flat&ldquo; tone in the fifth. But if you then tell me that &bdquo;A#-E&ldquo; is a flat fifth, then there will be lots of confusion because A# is sharp and E is natural (i.e. no flats are used). And if words like &bdquo;augmented&ldquo; or &bdquo;diminished&ldquo; CAN describe the alterations you mean (i.e. chromatic alterations of intervals), it&rsquo;s better to use these because then you don&rsquo;t end up describing two different things with one word. -- For another thing, you&rsquo;re using &bdquo;sharp third&ldquo; and &bdquo;flat third&ldquo;, but nothing in-between, like if there were no &bdquo;unaltered&ldquo; thirds. This even adds to the confusion because there are actually two of these, which you can judge for yourself if you study the origins of triadic harmony carefully.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=83157 href="#83157">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2009 11:58:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Petr;</p><p>Let me explain one of the problems that I find with the term<br/>diminished, which you have yourself illustrated in your response here:</p><p>As I understand our point of view, what I call Ebb you call E<br/>diminished. i.e. (2L-2s) lower than E in meantone terms.</p><p>Yet you describe the diminished chord as containing a diminished fifith.</p><p>In my terms the diminished chord contains a flat fifth bV. e.g. C-Eb-Gb</p><p>If you are using the diminished term to mean a double flattening of a<br/>notes; this suggests that your diminished contains a Gbb.</p><p>In meantone by sharpening or flattening notes you are raising or<br/>lowering the pitch always by the same number of cents (L-s).</p><p>Yes I am saying that the interval from A# to E is a flat fifth.

So with your thinking if a note<br/>&gt; is already flattened<br/>&gt; &gt; by the key signature e.g. Bb, if you wished to flatten it to Bbb,<br/>&gt; you would add a flat<br/>&gt; &gt; to the notation of an already flattened B to indicate Bbb.<br/>&gt; &gt; How would you notate an A# to be played in a piece for which your<br/>&gt; key signature is Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; (i.e. 2 flats signs in the key signature)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My goodness, I wasn&rsquo;t saying you couldn&rsquo;t mix altered notes on the<br/>&gt; same stave -- and I&rsquo;m not sure why you thought I was. Of course you<br/>&gt; can, why could you not? I was talking about something completely<br/>&gt; different, which was the fact that while the terms &bdquo;sharp&ldquo; and<br/>&gt; &bdquo;flat&ldquo; usually describe chromatic alterations of pitches (namely of<br/>&gt; those with no accidentals), you seem to be using the same words to<br/>&gt; describe chromatic alterations of intervals, not pitches (without<br/>&gt; providing a clear explanation what intervals are the &bdquo;unaltered&ldquo;<br/>&gt; ones which you can alter by adding a &bdquo;sharp&ldquo; or &bdquo;flat&ldquo; to them). But<br/>&gt; this means that now there are two different meanings for &bdquo;sharp&ldquo; and<br/>&gt; &bdquo;flat&ldquo; and it&rsquo;s not clear when we should understand them in one way<br/>&gt; and when in the other. So if you say to me &bdquo;play a flat fifth&ldquo;, I<br/>&gt; would assume you want me to use some &bdquo;flat&ldquo; tone in the fifth. But<br/>&gt; if you then tell me that &bdquo;A#-E&ldquo; is a flat fifth, then there will be<br/>&gt; lots of confusion because A# is sharp and E is natural (i.e. no<br/>&gt; flats are used). And if words like &bdquo;augmented&ldquo; or &bdquo;diminished&ldquo; CAN<br/>&gt; describe the alterations you mean (i.e. chromatic alterations of<br/>&gt; intervals), it&rsquo;s better to use these because then you don&rsquo;t end up<br/>&gt; describing two different things with one word. -- For another thing,<br/>&gt; you&rsquo;re using &bdquo;sharp third&ldquo; and &bdquo;flat third&ldquo;, but nothing in-between,<br/>&gt; like if there were no &bdquo;unaltered&ldquo; thirds. This even adds to the<br/>&gt; confusion because there are actually two of these, which you can<br/>&gt; judge for yourself if you study the origins of triadic harmony<br/>&gt; carefully.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Charles Lucy<br/><a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a></p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=83158 href="#83158">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2009 12:01:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Daniel,</p><p>On Apr 21, 2009, at 7:00 AM, Daniel Forr&oacute; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s extremely common to refer to augmented intervals as &quot;sharpened&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;sharp&quot; intervals and diminished intervals as &quot;flattened&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;flat&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s extremely common in jazz, which doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s justified by<br/>&gt; this.</p><p>I guess, sharps and flat are just convenient for notating raised/<br/>flattened intervals.

I&apos;m &gt;&gt; talking about pitches.<br/>&gt; &gt; You said there was wiggle in the pitches.  Is there or not?</p><p>Musical pitches are generally understood to wiggle.  I wouldn&apos;t define a scale as an equivalence classes on scales.   That way leads to recursion hell.  The word &quot;pitch&quot; may be applied to wiggly things and the things they wiggle relative to.  Even then, wiggly pitches aren&apos;t an equivalence class on precise pitches.</p><p>From the Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics: &quot;... if two equivalence classes have an element in common, then the two classes are, as sets, equal.&quot;  That means if two wiggly pitches contain the same precise pitch, the two wiggly pitches are the same, and a slippery slope leads to all wiggly pitches being the same.  That can easily happen with precise but inaccurate pitch notations.</p><p>Take cents, as with the AFMM notation.  A pitch will not be performed with exactly the offset that&apos;s written down. Composers not being robots, you can&apos;t assume their intentions are accurate to the nearest cent.  And so, in practice, there will be a lot of overlap.</p><p>Similarly, I can write music in decimal notation and convert it to 72-equal notation.  That doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m constraining a performer&apos;s pitch freedom to one 144th part of an octave either side of the theoretical pitch.</p><p>A better mathematical model is to say that a wiggly pitch is a fuzzy set of precise pitches.  You can take that further if you like.  I don&apos;t think anybody&apos;s defined a pitch system based on fuzzy logic.</p><p>It looks like any reasonable pitch system will give intervals belonging to an abelian group.  (I think I got that right this time.)  That&apos;s the level of abstraction you can work at for theorems concerning arbitrary pitches.  To get scales you need some concept of ordering.  But not all pitches in the system need to be ordered.  For example, you can define major scales without deciding the order of C sharp and D flat.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=83214 href="#83214">ðŸ”—</a>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2009 2:02:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; All the scales that I listed are unique scales and will work in all<br/>&gt; and every transposition, so I do not understand your assumption about<br/>&gt; 15 (by fifths) from Cb to C#.</p><p>Charles,<br/>thanks for your further answer.
