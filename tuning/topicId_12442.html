Use as strong a set of springs as you can.</p><p>Paul, you are the perfect antidote to a swelled head!  Just when I&apos;m<br/>ready to take a bow for a job well done, you&apos;re not satisfied!  See<br/>more exact JI results below...</p><p>[Paul (to Joe Monzo):]<br/>&gt;By the way, the link from the definition of &quot;pain&quot; in your dictionary,<br/>&gt;on the word &quot;adaptive&quot;, would better lead to a definition for<br/>&gt;&quot;adaptive tuning&quot; rather than &quot;adaptive JI&quot;. In adaptive JI the pain<br/>&gt;of having vertical sonorities deviate from JI is infinite, while in<br/>&gt;adaptive tuning, all the different components of pain get traded off<br/>&gt;against one another.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>[Joe Monzo:]<br/>&gt;Actually, IMO John deLaubenfel&apos;s dynamic version doesn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt;bad at all, my only objection being a slight beating on the<br/>&gt;&apos;D&apos; chord.</p><p>Whad&apos;ya mean, &quot;Actually&quot;?  ;-&gt;</p><p>[Monz:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d like to include the dynamic version of your<br/>&gt;&gt;first retuning, John (the one which didn&apos;t sustain the &apos;D&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt;into the final chord).  Please post the results.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;You must have misunderstood John&apos;s post. The result he posted _was_ the<br/>&gt;dynamic retuning, identical to your second example. The reason this<br/>&gt;didn&apos;t have any retune motion for any notes was that one already has<br/>&gt;all chords perfectly in JI without encountering any retune motion or<br/>&gt;drift, which you must have appreciated when you created your second<br/>&gt;example.</p><p>Correct, Paul.</p><p>[Monz:]<br/>&gt;&gt;(BTW, I need a definition for COFT).</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Optimal tuning for short -- the definition is the same as the incorrect<br/>&gt;definition you previously had for &quot;adaptive JI&quot; -- namely, a form of<br/>&gt;temperament where some function (say, sum-of-squares) of the deviation<br/>&gt;of the intervals from JI is minimized.</p><p>Well, COFT stands for &quot;Calculated Optimum Fixed Tuning&quot;; I&apos;ll post a<br/>more amplified definition in a separate post.</p><p>[Monz:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d still like to make a version using Vicentino&apos;s tuning, just<br/>&gt;&gt;to hear what it sounds like.  Please post the values.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;As I said, Vicentino&apos;s method is not defined for minor seventh aka<br/>&gt;added 6th chords, since retuning them to JI would require three, rather<br/>&gt;than two, meantone chains. There are two ways of doing that, and also<br/>&gt;two ways of sticking with one meantone chain and allowing one harmonic<br/>&gt;interval to be in meantone rather than JI. So there are four<br/>&gt;near-Vicentino solutions. . . .</p><p>Poo.  Vicentino is deflated.  But then, I&apos;m not sure you ever pushed<br/>his method for more recent music, Paul.</p><p>[Monz:]<br/>&gt;&gt;But I&apos;m not sure why you say (in private email) that &apos;adaptive JI&apos; is<br/>&gt;&gt;*not* a temperament... I think it is.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;I think of JI and temperament as mutually exclusive opposites . . .<br/>&gt;maybe I shouldn&apos;t.</p><p>I suggest that we DO use the term &quot;adaptive JI&quot; when vertical intervals<br/>are held to exact JI, and &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; for the general case where<br/>vertical pain is not infinite.  As for the application of the word<br/>&quot;temperament&quot;, I agree that adaptive JI is not a temperament; adaptive<br/>tuning (non JI) to some extent IS dynamic temperament.</p><p>[Monz:]<br/>&gt;&gt;How about giving me a nice general definition for &apos;adaptive tuning&apos;</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;That would be a form of tuning, often specific to a single piece of<br/>&gt;music, where the exact pitch of each pitch class changes at each<br/>&gt;instance in order to minimize pain. If the pain of having vertical<br/>&gt;deviations from JI is considered infinite, one obtains adaptive JI.<br/>&gt;Harald Waage had described one form of adaptive JI in the pages of 1/1.</p><p>A good definition.</p><p>[Joseph Pehrson:]<br/>&gt;Finally, I was surprised on how smooth and proportioned John<br/>&gt;deLaubenfels&apos; examples seemed again. He&apos;s really &quot;onto&quot; something,<br/>&gt;whether it&apos;s a &quot;temperament&quot; or not... but it wouldn&apos;t actually be a<br/>&gt;&quot;temperament&quot; would it?? It&apos;s too dynamic, and changes all the time!</p><p>&gt;It really sounds gooood.</p><p>Thanks, Joe!  I like it too...</p><p>[Joe:]<br/>&gt;But, am I possibly being influence by what I am HOPING to hear??<br/>&gt;That I don&apos;t know, since I haven&apos;t been &quot;blindfolded&quot; or &quot;earfolded.&quot;</p><p>Nah, this is nice &apos;n&apos; smooth, I think.  If I do say so myself.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;A similar question is the one Monz and I are currently grappling with,<br/>&gt;whether adaptive JI should be considered a temperament. I initially<br/>&gt;thought not since the chords are in JI within themselves, but perhaps<br/>&gt;you&apos;ve given me another reason to think not, Joseph: in a temperament,<br/>&gt;each pitch-class would only have one pitch associated with it, while<br/>&gt;something more dynamic shouldn&apos;t be considered a temperament at all? Or<br/>&gt;maybe it should . . . geez, do we have any linguistic precedents to<br/>&gt;guide us here?</p><p>Apparently not!  We can decide our own terms, unimpeded by the past.<br/>Again, my suggestion would be that adaptive tuning (non exact JI) should<br/>be considered a temperament; adaptive JI should not.</p><p>OK!
