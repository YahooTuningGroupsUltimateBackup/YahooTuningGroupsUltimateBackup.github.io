If one was going to try and hear very small intervals it would be best<br/>&gt; to use a computer. A monochord wth a long string would be tough. Measurements<br/>&gt; would have to be EXACT. Even then if you think your measurements are exact<br/>&gt; you still wouldn&apos;t hear it and couldn&apos;t really be sure. With a computer if<br/>&gt; its programmed correctly at least you would know its playing what you want<br/>vexactly even though you dont hear it. (or at least as accurately as the<br/>&gt; computer system allows)</p><p>&gt; With any live instruments though before doing something like that an<br/>&gt; exploration should occur of the possible accuracy of an instrument, whatever<br/>&gt; it is. It doesn&apos;t seem fair to say that many wind instruments, although<br/>&gt; maybe, can even play intervals 1 cent wide only, let alone less, and let<br/>&gt; alone accurately.</p><p>Okay, time for some numbers:</p><p>Contrabass has string of length around a metre or just over.</p><p>Add 10 cents to frequency = multiply frequency by 1.00579.<br/>Since frequency prop. to 1/lenght, this corr. to reducing length by<br/>1/1.00579 = 0.9942<br/>I.e. around 6 mm.</p><p>So in first position on double base, one cent is equivalent to about half<br/>a millimetre adjustment of the fingers.</p><p>At the frequeny of a Contrabass low E, 10 cents discrimination is fairly<br/>challenging, but possible, and 20 cents is fairly easy to hear.</p><p>5 cents, is prob. beyond many players discrimination at this pitch.<br/>That corresponds to movement of finger of 3 mm, which is a large amount<br/>on a string instrument!</p><p>So on lowest strings of Double base, players must be able to finger notes<br/>that they can&apos;t easily distinguish in pitch.</p><p>Now, suppose a ContraBass player wants to learn to play in 1200-tet.<br/>One could start by learning to play an ascending scale in 120-tet.<br/>Start with the 12-tet notes, and interpolate 10 notes between<br/>each one. One may be able to hear all the pitches as distinct, and<br/>one will very likely at least hear every second note in the sequence<br/>as distinct.</p><p>Here&apos;s a midi clip. I&apos;ve gone up to 100 cents in steps of 10 cents.<br/>This corresponds to finger spacings of 6 mm.<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_100_step_10_E1_CBass.mid">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_100_step_10_E1_CBass.mid</a></p><p>Now to play in 1200-tet one needs to do the same again - find one of<br/>the 10 cent steps, and subdivide it into ten steps each of 1 cent.<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_10_step_1_E1_CBass.mid">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_10_step_1_E1_CBass.mid</a></p><p>(<br/>Here, I think the final step down from 10 cents to 0 cents is just<br/>barely perceptible<br/>Here it is in reverse:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_10_step_1_E1_CBass_reverse.mid">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_10_step_1_E1_CBass_reverse.mid</a></p><p>If you like a puzzle, can you tell which this is?<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_10_step_1_E1_CBass_puzzle.mid">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/sse/0_to_10_step_1_E1_CBass_puzzle.mid</a><br/>)</p><p>Okay, I don&apos;t have a double base to hand to try this out, but it<br/>seems feasible.</p><p>Now, to turn to instrument I do have to hand, the recorder.</p><p>On treble recorder, if I try to play consecutive notes in 120-tet,<br/>(matching with computer generated pitches) I can play about four<br/>notes at normal volume for normal fingering, with the turbulence<br/>pitch bending technique.</p><p>E.g.<br/> for middle C, can play<br/>(C-30) c-20, c-10, c, c+10, c+20, (c+30)<br/>(numbers in cents).<br/>C-30 and c+30 are just about possible.

It would be an interesting experiment!</p><p>With 2.5 cents increments, that gives an ascending scale in 480-tet, and I can<br/>no longer easily distinguish the pitches of successive notes of the scale by ear,<br/>but can still play them.</p><p>Actually, I think perhaps I can hear a distinction right now. On the<br/>edge of what is possible.</p><p>Maybe just happens if one is particularly alert and fresh - this varies so much.<br/>Or maybe, if one has been practicing small pitch increments for an hour<br/>or so, that tunes one into hearing them...</p><p>I think interpolating 10 notes between c6 - 10 cents and C6  would be quite<br/>a challenge, but then, I&apos;m an amateur, and don&apos;t spend hours every day<br/>working on my technique.</p><p>Pitch of recorder also is especially sensitive to breath.<br/>Maybe other instruments would require more breath pressure to bend the pitch</p><p>So I think answer, in terms of practicality for wind instruments<br/>for a professional, must certainly be Yes!</p><p>For string instruments, probably yes as well - any string players<br/>like to say?</p><p>There&apos;s still a bit of a problem here - if one can only get the notes<br/>to within, say, 4 cents of the exact pitch in the first case,<br/>then the whole sequence of notes could be out by up to 4 cents.<br/>That may be what happened with the clip, where first note is flat<br/>by 1.5 cents.</p><p>More thought / discussion needed at this point I&apos;m sure.</p><p>However, to go back to the notation thread, seems a 12-tet friendly<br/>easy system to learn.</p><p>Even an amateur can probably learn to play ten notes for each<br/>12-tet semitone, to get an ascending scale in 120-tet.</p><p>Not so hard as one would think at first, considering one probably<br/>uses the same fingering for only about 5 notes.</p><p>E.g. on recorder, use middle c fingering and vary breath pressure<br/>and turbulence, gives me c-20, c-10, c, c+10, c+20, and I could<br/>learn those notes I think. Then one needs to work out a fingering<br/>for the notes in the gaps, e.g. c+30, c+40, c+50 , C+60 and c+70.</p><p>Since even with the turbulence technique to bend pitch, I need a<br/>new fingering at least every 50 cents on average, so an idea would be<br/>to start by working out a 24-tet fingering for the recorder.</p><p>Then, one could learn to play the notes of 120-tet by interpolating 5 notes<br/>for each 24-tet note.</p><p>Then, to get the last decimal place of the cents notation,<br/>one will interpolate as best one can. For example, to go to<br/>386 cents, one will play a note about six tenths of the way<br/>between notes 38 and 39 in the 120-tet scale one has learnt.</p><p>Probably only a professional will be able to do this to any<br/>degree of accuracy, but an amateur can give it a go anyway.</p><p>Nice thing about this system is that though easy to learn and<br/>understand, it also encourages everyone to strive beyond whatever<br/>is their current level of intonational accuracy.</p><p>While 72-tet notation instead could easily encourage players to<br/>settle for even less than their a normal level of intonational<br/>accuracy, I think.</p><p>Jon:</p><p>&gt; Sure: just attach the keyboard to whatever Scala-tuned synth you have<br/>&gt; and - voila! - accuracy beyond what they (may) actually hear!</p><p>&gt; In reality though, and leaving aside any beyond-mortal beings, there<br/>&gt; are so many aspects that relate to live performance on both<br/>&gt; instruments and voice that your &quot;contrived example&quot; is pretty much<br/>&gt; just that. Great performers can do miraculous things, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; think that it is fair (or remotely sane!) to say that any more than a<br/>&gt; few &apos;touched&apos; individuals could play with greater accuracy then they<br/>&gt; can hear.

My point with wind instruments wasn&apos;t that you couldn&apos;t<br/>play small intervals. Surely this would vary from instrument to instrument<br/>and player to player. On a side note, Ben Johnston told me a few days ago<br/>that he stopped giving microtonal fingerings to performers, for wind inst,<br/>because if his performers used the ones he gave they would always be slightly<br/>different pitches than his intention, and so he therefore stopped giving<br/>alternate fingerings and made players find the fingerings on their own. I<br/>dont know how long hes been doing this.</p><p>I definitely was not saying it wasn&apos;t possible for all wind instruments to<br/>play intervals of a cent, but I was saying that it might not be possible for<br/>some of them. What I mean is it might not be possiblle to play intervals of a<br/>cent on some instruments. Certainly it might be possible on others. I would<br/>also guess it would be much more difficul to play small microtones on a<br/>violin than a double bass obviously because the string length is much shorter<br/>and then requires smaller finger moves. Is it still possible however???, well<br/>maybe it sure might be. I was really trying to contradict what Johnny said<br/>about pitch on an infinite continuum where you just stop and get it right. I<br/>just dont thin that happens in real performance, although it is definately<br/>more possible in isolated circumstances. Also it MIGHT not be even possible<br/>on some instruments for various mechanical reasons. Anyway I was not saying<br/>its not possible always, and I was saying it might not be possible with some.</p><p>The type of thing that you just showed, although I couldn&apos;t get the .ra<br/>example to work, is exactly the sort of thing that is important. As for you<br/>conclusion of being able to improve ones ability to distinguish pitches I<br/>wasn&apos;t attempting to show disagreement to that in the first place. I have<br/>said I dont believe Johnny that he always hits the exact pitches and knows he<br/>hits them to a degree of one cent, because I dont believe that for one second<br/>with out some evidence to back it up. I have heard too many ear trainng<br/>students say, &quot;I&apos;m hearing it but I didn&apos;t write it down right.&quot; Or some<br/>other analagous phrase menaing they cant prove it. On the other hand in<br/>isolated circumstances where you are matching pitch to a computer which is<br/>exact and then measure your error, like you did, one definately can improve<br/>at this sort of thing. So can you improve ones sense of pitch,definately  I<br/>agree. The most important question then seems to be, &quot;What is possible for<br/>the best of players to perceive and accurately play on various instruments in<br/>isolated circumstances, and in real performance(which must be done with CD&apos;s<br/>of performances)?&quot;</p><p>Great post,<br/>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 1:48:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/10/01 8:49 AM, &quot;<a href="mailto:xjhouston7@yahoo.com">xjhouston7@yahoo.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:xjhouston7@yahoo.com">xjhouston7@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes indeed, the onus is on you.

I don&apos;t<br/>think you would guess 100% correctly which of these are a great<br/>psychological accomplishment or not.  If I asked which of these you thought<br/>were an accomplishment or not, you&apos;d most likely wind up with a different<br/>set of answers, than if I told you that you would most likely get three<br/>answers wrong, because then you&apos;d be seeded with the thought of something to<br/>look for.</p><p>Personally, I don&apos;t do cents.  I can&apos;t really register the value of an<br/>interval as a test tone.  It&apos;s too small a microcosm for me to grasp.  I can<br/>only make distinctions in major applications of *certain* temperaments.<br/>That said, after 12 years or so of playing microtonal guitar, I can<br/>distinguish between several different temperaments played on guitar very<br/>quickly because I&apos;m used to the way the different fretting changes the<br/>timbre.  As I&apos;ve said, when Johnny mistakenly announced on the radio<br/>interview that my piece was in 34, and later had the DJ correct the opening<br/>statement to 32, Johnny in apologizing shrugged and said to me &quot;aw come on<br/>who can hear the difference between 32 and 34 guitar...&quot;  In response to my<br/>glare he said &quot;BESIDES you!!!&quot;  I might stress distinction of temperament<br/>more than most people do, so I haven&apos;t even yet seen the value of knowing<br/>all the cent values of intervals.  For the purpose of what *I* do with the<br/>knowledge of microtonal music elements, (which occasionally results in<br/>writing) the absolute interval size, or &quot;cents&quot; spectrum is not so much<br/>irrelevant or demeaning, as it is *confusing* trying to jam 30 different<br/>temperaments into unequal scales in 1200-tET.</p><p>So do we agree to differ?  Not consciously.  I can feel the aural difference<br/>between 32 and 34 on guitar.  For Johnny to do this, he&apos;d have to sit there<br/>and go &quot;bommm BINNGGG hmmm LA LA LA&quot; and figure out enough intervals to see<br/>what temperament it was etc.  But also, Johnny does THIS to me frequently:<br/>says &quot;bommm BINNG what interval was that?&quot;  I say I don&apos;t know and I don&apos;t<br/>care.  I might be able to guess within about 10 or 20 cents... depending on<br/>what interval in what temperament it sounds like, but it really doesn&apos;t<br/>register much to me.</p><p>This is ironic to both of us because Johnny is usually more holistic and<br/>macro operation oriented, and I usually build music up from the quantum<br/>level.  Or maybe it&apos;s that we think and talk about music on the other side<br/>of the brain from where we actually shut up and play it.</p><p>Let&apos;s nip this puppy already.  As someone ALREADY pointed out, a 1-cent<br/>deviation at 440 Hz is 1/4 Hz.  If a 440 and the note 1 cent higher were<br/>played simultaneously, since the phase period is about 4 seconds, they would<br/>go OUT of phase after about 2 seconds.  Which means the amplitude envelope<br/>goes from 100% to 0% in 2 seconds.  That&apos;s a pretty drastic vibrato.  That&apos;s<br/>a pretty steep envelope.  Figuring that much out, I think you&apos;d have to be<br/>deaf not to be able to hear that if it was being done in front of you.</p><p>So Johnny has seemingly spent a lot time with this threshhold.  So Johnny is<br/>claiming he could sing a note to within a cent.  All that means is, if he<br/>sings a 440, it won&apos;t go out of phase with a 440 tone in 2 seconds.  I think<br/>for a virtual instrument, it&apos;s very simple to lock into a frequency within<br/>about maybe a quarter second.  For someone like Johnny, probably a bit less.</p><p>But then there&apos;s the other issue on the table.  The fact that he&apos;s at the<br/>level where, not only can he *hear* things in his head clearly, he&apos;s refined<br/>that talent to be able to sculpt sounds mentally.  From that, he can play or<br/>sing along with music that&apos;s already queued *in* his head.  So unless you<br/>know of a way to physically extrude music from someone&apos;s mind, how about we<br/>drop this thread.</p><p>Now relook over the list at the beginning of this post.  I&apos;m not speaking to<br/>anyone in particular - but I think the tendencies of the musician&apos;s ego are<br/>like this:  Pretty much everything you do every day, and think everyone else<br/>should be able to do, you won&apos;t care about because it&apos;s like a child tugging<br/>at your leg trying to show you something they did while you&apos;re wrapped up in<br/>something that intrigues you.  On the other hand, when you hear about<br/>something that you personally *can&apos;t* do, you&apos;ll find it not only<br/>intimidating, but you&apos;ll think it&apos;s &quot;impossible&quot; and start thinking of the<br/>person who claims they can do it as being a prima donna!!!</p><p>&quot;I know three chords man&quot;<br/>&quot;Oh yeah well I know four chords man&quot;<br/>&quot;No way man&quot;<br/>&quot;Way man&quot;<br/>&quot;Show me&quot;<br/>&quot;No&quot;<br/>Welcome back to the bar band scene.</p><p>In claiming to be professionals or intellectuals, why can&apos;t you simply take<br/>the word of a colleague, especially a world-renowned, well-traveled and<br/>accomplished colleague, when they&apos;re simply giving you a *fraction* of their<br/>r&eacute;sum&eacute;?

Figuring that much out, I think you&apos;d have to be<br/>&gt; deaf not to be able to hear that if it was being done in front of you.</p><p>Umm . . . you&apos;re talking about a _harmonic_ unison being 0 cents vs. 1 cent. That&apos;s perhaps<br/>0.0001% of the considerations involved in this issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All that means is, if he<br/>&gt; sings a 440, it won&apos;t go out of phase with a 440 tone in 2 seconds.</p><p>Is that really all he means? It seems to a lot of people that he was claiming a lot more<br/>than that (no offense, Johnny). I can sing in unison with a reference tone -- whoopdee-<br/>doo. In fact, some microtonal composers have given the performers reference tones in<br/>their headphones to aid performance. But Johnny does not do that -- so I don&apos;t thing this<br/>is a valid reduction, Marc.</p><p>&gt; Now relook over the list at the beginning of this post.  I&apos;m not speaking to<br/>&gt; anyone in particular - but I think the tendencies of the musician&apos;s ego are<br/>&gt; like this:  Pretty much everything you do every day, and think everyone else<br/>&gt; should be able to do, you won&apos;t care about because it&apos;s like a child tugging<br/>&gt; at your leg trying to show you something they did while you&apos;re wrapped up in<br/>&gt; something that intrigues you.  On the other hand, when you hear about<br/>&gt; something that you personally *can&apos;t* do, you&apos;ll find it not only<br/>&gt; intimidating, but you&apos;ll think it&apos;s &quot;impossible&quot; and start thinking of the<br/>&gt; person who claims they can do it as being a prima donna!!!</p><p>Maybe some people were reacting like this but I think others were genuinely interested<br/>if they could notate their music in 1200-tET and expect reliable performance -- hence the<br/>request for an objective test, using scientific instruments, did not seem totally<br/>unreasonable. I don&apos;t think anyone would think any less of Johnny if it turned out that he<br/>sometimes made errors of 2 or 3 cents -- I sure wouldn&apos;t!</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s not a lot of things, that are immediately more<br/>&gt; emotionally abusive, than to answer someone confessing a talent with<br/>&gt; something like &quot;no you can&apos;t; prove it.&quot;</p><p>True -- but not a lot of people said &quot;no you can&apos;t&quot;. It&apos;s too bad if one person did say that.<br/>But I think you don&apos;t have too look to far into the archives to find a lot of things a lot more<br/>emotionally abusive than this. And you don&apos;t have to look at a lot of lists to find one a lot<br/>more emotionally abusive that this one. I&apos;m sorry if Johnny&apos;s feelings were hurt -- he&apos;s<br/>certainly doing a lot more for our cause than almost anyone. But no one is harmed by<br/>good, honest, intellectual debate. If you&apos;re going to make a specific statement about your<br/>abilities, then you have to expect that people will ask you to prove it. And these are<br/>people interested in microtonality, so are inherently friendlier to the idea than the<br/>majority of people who aren&apos;t. I think it would be great to find out just what Johnny&apos;s ear,<br/>voice, and/or bassoon _are_ capable of, because I&apos;m sure it&apos;s fabulous, and would blow<br/>the minds of many of the doubters out there. 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents . . . still fabulous. So<br/>all in all, I see this debate as _positive_ -- the honest search for truth can only help all<br/>involved.</p><p>Just my humble opinion and I&apos;d perfectly happy if this entire thread disappeared right<br/>now -- I&apos;m just (as always) trying to understand the point of view of the &quot;other guy&quot; in<br/>the debate.</p></div><h3>xjhouston7@yahoo.com</h3><span>6/10/2001 4:47:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you don&apos;t like my sharing what I intend and believe I achieve,<br/>just<br/>&gt; let it go already.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny</p><p>Okay, we let it go now.

One could try subdividing<br/>each 12-tet semitone into 6 steps, and so get 72-tet, and then divide<br/>each of those into 5 steps and get 360-tet, and so on, and it<br/>would work equally well.</p><p>I suppose the nice thing about using the sequence<br/>12-tet (24-tet) 120-tet (240-tet) 1200-tet<br/>is that it links in with our decimal number system, and so is easier<br/>to understand when one continues to interpolate to finer and finer<br/>accuracy.</p><p>36-tet and 72-tet would be fine if we used base 12 for numbers instead<br/>of base 10.</p><p>12-tet 36-tet 72-tet 144-tet 432-tet 864-tet 1728-tet<br/>and maybe we&apos;d now have 1728 cents to an octave, except, using<br/>the place system in base 12, we&apos;d call it 1000 cents to an octave<br/>because 1000 in base 12 is 1728.</p><p>The advantages of base 12 have often been pointed out, but so<br/>far there is no signs of anyone taking heed and starting a mass<br/>move to change from 10 to 12. I suppose because we have 10 fingers,<br/>and people like occasionally to be able to count on their fingers!<br/>Also there are competing good systems like hexadecimal, which<br/>programmers would rather like as it is a great notation for<br/>memory dumps and when one wants to use bit operations (and for<br/>midi of course), but not so good for calculations<br/>by hand, as the number base has only the one prime divisor 2.</p><p>I think for a uniform arbitrarily precise notation, best to link<br/>into the current notation for numbers.</p><p>Take ex. of a piece in 17-tet.</p><p>72-tet notation doesn&apos;t have the necessary resolution:<br/>degree 2 in 17-tet is 141.176 cents and the nearest note in 72-tet is 133.333 cents.</p><p>So one is going to have to go beyond it to the next place in the number<br/>system, in this case, 144-tet. But for some notes in 17-tet, even<br/>144-tet wouldn&apos;t be that good, e.g. degree 3 is  211.765 cents<br/>and nearest 144-tet note is 208.333 cents - not bad, but if<br/>some performers such as Johnny can play to much better than 3 cents resolution,<br/>and one would like to encourage others to strive to achieve better resolution too,<br/>better to go further, to 432-tet at least.</p><p>For some notes, for precision to the nearest cent, will need to go to 864-tet.</p><p>That would be fine, and great, if we were used to thinking in base 12.<br/>One would write degree 3 in 17-tet as degree 76 in 432-tet (= 211.111<br/>cents). Or, degree 304 in 1728-tet.</p><p>Except of course, one would use base 12 for all the numbers.</p><p>So in fact, one would write 211.111 cents (out of 1200) as<br/>214 (to base 12) cents (out of 1000 to base 12)<br/>in the system of 1728 cents per octave.</p><p>2*144+1*12+4 cents = 304 (base 10)</p><p>So degree 3 in 17-tet would be 214.something cents<br/>in this system.</p><p>Would be a nice system for 12-tet too - the 12-tet notes would be<br/>100 cetns, 200 cents, ... 900 centes, a00 cents b00 cents 1000 cents<br/>where a = 10 and b = 11.</p><p>Yes, that would work fine.</p><p>However, people are slow to change to a new number system, so<br/>I&apos;m sure rather than learn to think in base 12, they are going to<br/>ignore the least significant digits of the notation - probably anything<br/>much beyond 72-tet. Performers would ignore them, and composers<br/>would soon stop using them. Result is, intonation would suffer, I think.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there are plenty of nice things one can say about 72-tet notation.<br/>and it is of course the best one to use if the piece was conceived in<br/>72-tet.</p><p>But if someone is using cents, and find that works well for them,<br/>no need for them to change to 72-tet notation!</p><p>A nice thing about cents notation is that it especially encourages<br/>players to continually strive beyond their current level of<br/>intonational accuracy, whatever it is.</p><p>Ideal of course is to use the notation natural to the piece.<br/>So if in 17-tet, use 17-tet sharps and flats. For 19-tet, use<br/>19-tet sharps and flats. In 31-tet, use 31-tet half sharps and flats.<br/>In j.i., use ratios. For fixed pitch instruments (guitar, gamelan<br/>ensemble as it is fixed pitch to the extent it is anchored by the<br/>tuning of the gamelan percussion, ....), use tablature or such<br/>like notation. Etc. etc.</p><p>Hope you enjoy this - I had fun writing it, especially, trying to imagine<br/>what it would be like in an alternative universe in which we<br/>all thought naturally in base 12.<br/>:-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2001 7:39:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/10/01 7:32 PM, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; As I&apos;ve said, when Johnny mistakenly announced on the radio<br/>&gt;&gt; interview that my piece was in 34,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I remember that!</p><p>Right.
