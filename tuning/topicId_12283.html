The recognition is appropriate and, I believe, somewhat<br/>belated...</p><p>Frank Oteri has been &quot;threatening&quot; to do an issue on microtonality<br/>for some time now, with the not-so-subtle encouragement of several<br/>persons, including my humble yours truly...</p><p>Now here it is!</p><p><a href="http://www.newmusicbox.org/index.html">http://www.newmusicbox.org/index.html</a></p><p>The &quot;lead article&quot; is on John Eaton, and it is interesting, and<br/>rather surprising for a couple of reasons.  Eaton has been involved<br/>in alternate tunings and electronic music for about as long as<br/>anybody... and yet he composes on two pianos tuned to 24-tEt!!!!</p><p>It &quot;surprised&quot; me... but this is reality.</p><p>There is still a LONG way to go with &quot;xenharmonic acceptance&quot; but, I<br/>believe the fastest way to get there is to ACCEPT the reality as it<br/>stands and transform it... not to go off in little microtonal<br/>&quot;covens&quot; and practice &quot;rash experiments&quot; to a couple of the<br/>like-minded...</p><p>Aside from this lead article, there is an extended article, as Joe 1<br/>mentions, on microtonality by Kyle Gann.  It is terrific... but<br/>somehow not quite as convincing as Gann&apos;s OWN web pages... that tend<br/>to be a bit more elaborative.  Why couldn&apos;t they just link to those??</p><p>Also missing are some very important links.  There are no links to<br/>John Starrett&apos;s main site a MUST for anybody interested in<br/>microtonality... there is no link to Graham Breed&apos;s site.  Also a<br/>must!  Joe Monzo, probably because he is in the articles, IS linked,<br/>fortunately...</p><p>Johnny Reinhard gets top billing in the group shot... but Monz, Joe<br/>Maneri, and Lois Vierk also get good billing.  I was also a little<br/>surprised that Lois doesn&apos;t use microtonality in any systematic<br/>way...I love Lois, but perhaps Elodie Lauten would have been a better<br/>choice for that reason...</p><p>Anyway... a nice tap into the &quot;mainstream&quot; and a good indication of<br/>where we&apos;re all at at this moment, whether we like it or not!</p><p>It&apos;s basically GOOD news, not bad!<br/>_____________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
