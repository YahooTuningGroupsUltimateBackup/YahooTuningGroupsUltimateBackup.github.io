I&apos;d be happy to<br/>&gt; explore the possibilities with you. The Shrutar I recently posted about will<br/>&gt; also have some near-just chords, and be amenable to raga.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Jacky, Paul</p><p>I just went to David Canrights&apos; site, he brings up some very interesting<br/>points. I&apos;d like to work with both of you, and anyone else who is<br/>interested, on the design of such an instrument. I&apos;m still without a proper<br/>microtonal guitar at this time, thus most of my ideas of what I want are<br/>purely theoretical.</p><p>For me, the ability to switch between various open tunings is a<br/>compositional must have. While I think that the most commonly used and<br/>accepted &quot;standard tuning&quot; certainly has its&apos; uses, it seems to me that for<br/>JI music, I want to be able to compose with tunings that are very harmonic<br/>in their structure, thus allowing for a higher degree of resonance than can<br/>be achieved in EADGBE. One such tuning would be 1/1, 3/2, 1/1, 4/3, 3/2, 1/1<br/>(known in Celtic guitar circles as DADGAD)</p><p>I think that the interchangable fretboard is a great concept, however, if I<br/>were to have fretboards made for every tuning that I might want to use, the<br/>cost would be prohibitive. I wonder if perhaps there is a way we can find a<br/>perpendicular scheme that would allow for each string to be in a just scale<br/>of its&apos; own? And with enough frets that various combinations of strings<br/>would offer multiple tonal centers? I&apos;m thinking that the closest instrument<br/>I&apos;ve seen that does something like this perpendicular fretting is the saz.</p><p>Paul, I am curious as to what the tuning sheme of your Shrutar is?</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Seth</p><p>------<br/>Seth Austen<br/><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>--<br/>&quot;To be nobody-but-myself -- in a world which is doing its best, night and<br/>day, to make you everybody else -- means to fight the hardest battle which<br/>any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.&quot;<br/>                                                -- e.e. cummings</p></div><h3><a id=16615 href="#16615">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

So for JI that&apos;s more JI than meantone, standard tuning is out the<br/>&gt; window. JI guitar meister Jon Catler uses &quot;standard tuning&quot; but with a 27:20<br/>&gt; interval between his D and G strings (and tunes his B to the 60-cycle hum).</p><p>Interesting point. I wonder whether all fourths, similar to the oud or<br/>cumbus (all fourths and one second), or all fifths would be more suited to<br/>JI guitar.

It<br/>seems to me that fretless guitar offers us a greatly enhanced expression of<br/>single line melodic material, with some capacity for double stops and<br/>occasional chords (I play fiddle, getting even two stopped notes in tune<br/>together, let alone one note...), whereas the fretted JI guitar offers us<br/>increased harmonic chordal capabilities, along with the tone, sustain and<br/>accuracy.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen<br/><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/>------</p><p>&quot;The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic<br/>hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs.<br/>There&apos;s also a negative side.&quot;<br/>         - Hunter S.
