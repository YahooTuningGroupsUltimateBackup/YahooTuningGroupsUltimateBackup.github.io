Take note, Manuel (I do feel<br/>&gt;strongly that this improves upon Tenney&apos;s and Barlow&apos;s formulations,<br/>&gt;especially in the typical case where factors of two are ignored...</p><p>Sorry, Paul, but I&apos;ve had some problems following this thread.  Did you<br/>mean that weighting improved the city block metrics, or did you mean that<br/>city block metrics are better on a triangular lattice than on a square one?</p><p>If the latter, could you explain why?</p><p>C.</p></div>
