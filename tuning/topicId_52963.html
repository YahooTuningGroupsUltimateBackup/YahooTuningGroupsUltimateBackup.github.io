All concerts begin at 8 PM and general admission is $17, $12<br/>for seniors and students (with ID), at the door.</p><p>Opening night Wednesday, JS BACH IN WERCKMEISTER III, given at the Church of<br/>St. Luke in the Fields, is made up exclusively of works by Johann Sebastian<br/>Bach performed in its appropriate historic tuning for access to a more refined<br/>dimension of Bach&apos;s imagination and intentions.  The remaining three concerts<br/>are to be held at Faust Harrison Pianos, beginning March 28 with MICROTONES<br/>LITE, which aims to provide more easily digestible microtonal fare of six<br/>composers.  April 30 brings to town rarities of UKRAINIAN MICROTONAL CELLI featuring<br/>Duo Violoncellissimo of Odessa.  May 5 carries the banner of EATON PARTCH<br/>STANNARD in recognition of major works presented of composers John Eaton, Harry<br/>Partch and John Stannard.</p><p>Concert I:  Wednesday, March 24 at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields<br/>features Johann Sebastian Bach&apos;s cantata, ICH HABE GENUG, sung by baritone Carlos<br/>Archuleta.  The key of c Minor is darker in the tuning of Werckmeister III,<br/>with every one flat to conventional 12-tone equal temperament.  Likewise, Bach&apos;s<br/>BRANDENBURG CONCERTO #5, which features AFMM soloists Dan Auerbach (violin),<br/>Jennifer Grim (flute), &amp; Rebecca Pechefsky, offers a softer, more modal<br/>sounding D Major, as performed in Werckmeister III tuning.  For the ultimate<br/>contrast, Dutch oboist Bram Kreeftmeijer joins violin soloist Ralph Allen in Bach&apos;s<br/>OBOE AND VIOLIN CONCERTO in D minor.</p><p>Concert II:  Sunday, March 28 at Faust Harrison Pianos offers MICROTONES<br/>LITE, select works that are abundantly clear in their usage of microtonal<br/>alternatives.  Bassoonist Johnny Reinhard introduces A SOLO FOR ROBERT HUGHES by the<br/>late Lou Harrison to New York audiences.  AFMM Ensemble members violist<br/>Anastasia Solberg and pianist Joshua Pierce are featured in the<br/>microtonally-ornamented SONATA FOR VIOLA AND PIANO by Isang Yun and the quartertonal SONATA FOR<br/>VIOLA AND PIANO by Stephen Mayer.  Solberg premieres MOLI HUA for solo viola by<br/>Victoria Bond.  Former west coast and Barcelona flutist/composer Jane Rigler<br/>premieres her microtonally-charged solo ALBA.  And oboist Bram Kreeftmeijer<br/>plays Johnny Reinhard&apos;s colorful polymicrotonal oboe solo MELANIN.</p><p>Concert III:  Friday, April 30, again at Faust Harrison Pianos, presents the<br/>New York debut of the Ukrainian cello duo Vadim Larchikov and Olga Veselina in<br/>a program consisting exclusively of Ukrainian composers.  Prominent Ukrainian<br/>composer Alexander Shchetynsky is represented by his PAS DE DEUX for two<br/>celli.   Other featured duos for two cello players include Liudmila Yurina&apos;s<br/>DISTANZIERUNG, Alla Zagaykevych&apos;s GRAVITATION, and Sergiy Zazhitko&apos;s EPITAPH TO<br/>MARQUIS DE SADE.  As soloist, Vadim Larchikov will perform a segment of his<br/>magnum opus for cello, THE TEMPLES.   This concert was made possible thanks to a<br/>grant by Artslink.</p><p>Concert IV:  Wednesday, May 5, still again at Faust Harrison Pianos, features<br/>composer John Eaton&apos;s premiere of PERSEPHONE.  The trio has violist Anastasia<br/>Solberg in the role of Demeter, bassoonist Johnny Reinhard in the role of<br/>Hades, and 15-year-old Kayla Ny in the title role of Persephone.  Additionally,<br/>this concert offers a landmark performance of Harry Partch&apos;s 17 LYRICS BY LI<br/>PO, featuring Johnny Reinhard as vocalist and Solberg once again on viola.<br/>Composer John Stannard contributes MANNEQUINS as played by Joshua Pierce on<br/>electronic just intonation keyboard, and Christine Bard on 12 tuned gongs.</p></div><h3><a id=52965 href="#52965">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2004 2:25:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Contact:<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard AFMM</p><p>Johnny -</p><p>Just got my announcement card in the mail as I came in from work - very best to you on these four concerts!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=52966 href="#52966">ðŸ”—</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/2004 9:12:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ll post it around and spread the word...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Contact:<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard AFMM 212-517-3550<br/>&gt; Afmmjr@a...<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.afmm.org">http://www.afmm.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AMERICAN FESTIVAL OF MICROTONAL MUSIC presents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MicroFest 2004: 4 Concerts NYC<br/>&gt; Bach to the Future<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; March 24 at 8 pm at:<br/>&gt; The Church of St. Luke in the Fields (487 Hudson Street at Grove)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; March 28, April 30 &amp; May 5 at 8 pm at:<br/>&gt; Faust and Harrison Pianos (205 West 58th Street)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           The American Festival of Microtonal Music, under the<br/>direction of<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard, presents 4 New York Concerts starting March 24 at<br/>St. Luke in<br/>&gt; the Fields Church (located 487 Hudson Street at Grove Street in<br/>Greenwich<br/>&gt; Village), and continuing thereafter at Faust Harrison Pianos<br/>(located at 205 West<br/>&gt; 58th Street).
