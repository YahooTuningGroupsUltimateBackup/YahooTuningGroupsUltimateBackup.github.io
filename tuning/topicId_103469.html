My top criterion for any temperament or tuning system is whether it&apos;s helpful for making music, and I haven&apos;t found a &quot;magic&quot; formula yet that&apos;s a good substitute for actual experimentation.

It&apos;s impossible to know from a few cursory noodlings what can or cannot be accomplished with a given tuning.

Dividing a major third into two equal steps is enough to define meantone, for instance. You can identify either of the steps as 9/8 or 10/9, but it doesn&apos;t matter which -- it ends up tempering out 81/80 one way or the other. (Although this is the most likely identification, it could turn out that you&apos;re using the steps in a way that identifies them with some other pair of intervals, like 8/7 and 35/32, in which case you&apos;d be tempering out 256/245.)</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2012 6:52:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>May I offer that it isn&apos;t boredom that is the important point.
