I&apos;ve been working with a Kurzweil 2000, composing<br/>music based on<br/>11 &amp; 13 equal (ocassionally 11 &amp; 13 Carlos Just?).</p><p>It&apos;s been a blast!!!</p><p>Now I&apos;m hooked, but I need a keyboard that I can tune. The Kurzweil is<br/>pretty easy once you get the<br/>hang of it. The main problem with the 2000 is that sequences are<br/>uneditable, I believe. Also the<br/>2000 I&apos;m using cannot sample at this time, although the manual says that<br/>sampling would be available<br/>at a later date. Can this keyboard sample.</p><p>I&apos;ve been told I could buy one of these at about $500 - $600. True? (I&apos;m a<br/>student.)</p><p>Any suggestions for a superior keyboard on the cheap?</p><p>By the way I&apos;m mainly a Mac guy, although I have a PC.</p><p>Thanks forum.</p></div>
