I inquired<br/>as to what sort of tunings would be used, since I think that for at least<br/>some of the pieces 12tet would have not been current. The reply I received<br/>was that Bach&apos;s Well-Tempered Clavier was written during the era of 12tet<br/>and that the pianos would be tuned that way. Would any of you who know<br/>please tell me what tunings would have been most likely at the time of each<br/>of the following compositions, so that I may pass the information on to the<br/>people presenting the concert?</p><p> Haydn Sonata in Ab<br/> Mozart Sonata in A w/variations<br/> Mozart Sonata in A minor<br/> Beethoven  Fur Elise<br/> Beethoven Moonlight Sonata<br/> Beethoven  Waldstein Sonata<br/> Schubert  Sonata in A minor  DV 845<br/> Schumann  Symphonic Etudes, Scenes from Childhood<br/> Brahms  Piano Concerto #1<br/> Lizst Sonata in B minor<br/> Chopin  Fantasie in F minor, Prelude in A, Fantasie Impromptu, Polonaise<br/> Puccini  Arias  (transcribed by B.T.)<br/> Rachmaninoff Prelude in G minor</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p><p>John Link</p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.johnlinkmusic.com">www.johnlinkmusic.com</a> for info about the new CD by my vocal quintet.</p></div>
