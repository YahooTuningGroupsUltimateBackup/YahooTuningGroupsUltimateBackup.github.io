I refer to an invention by Dr. Thaddues Cahill.  He<br/>has constructed a comprehensive apparatus which makes it possible to<br/>transform an electric current into a fixed and mathematically exact<br/>number of vibrations.  As pitch depends on the number of vibrations,<br/>and the apparatus may be &quot;set&quot; on any number desired, the infinite<br/>gradation of the octave may be accomplished by merely moving a level<br/>corresponding to the pointer of a quadrant.</p><p>&quot;Only a long and careful series of experiments, and a continued<br/>training of the ear, can render this unfamiliar material approachable<br/>and plastic for the coming generation, and for Art.</p><p>&quot;And what a vista of fair hopes and dreamlike fancies is thus opened<br/>for them both!  Who has not dreamt that he could float on air? and<br/>firmly believed his dream to be reality? -- Let us take thought, how<br/>music may be restored to its primitive, natural essence; let it be<br/>pure invention and sentiment, in harmonies, in forms, in tone-colors<br/>(for invention and sentiment are not the prerogative of melody<br/>alone); let it follow the line of the rainbow and view with the<br/>clouds in breaking sunbeams; *let Music be naught else than Nature<br/>mirrored....*&quot;</p><p>JP</p></div>
