I participated in gathering 20 non-microtonal and 20 microtonal<br/>musicians for an EKG test (sp.?) to test the brain while listening and analyzing<br/>test material.</p><p>The results showed there is no difference in the way the two groups listen to<br/>music.  (I was however pulled aside and told that I was the exception.  It<br/>seems I listen right brain first and everyone else listened left brain first,<br/>anecdotally.)</p><p>I have not had the chance to read the full findings.  Anyone?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
