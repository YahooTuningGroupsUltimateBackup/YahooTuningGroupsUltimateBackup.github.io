In conjuction, I wonder if Wagner, Sch&ouml;nberg, Mahler and other &quot;please, not 12EQ again!&quot; advocates could have anything to do with what I have to propose below.</p><p>Whilst exploring Mr. Serge Cordier&apos;s 1975 stretched 12-tone octave temperament with pure fifths at every key, I wondered if an attempt could be made to acquire a meantone temperament of 12 equal divisions where a fundamental consonant interval is achieved at every key. The following is the result I obtained by splicing the pure fourth into 5 equal semi-tones and using 99.609 cents as the generator interval:</p><p>Ozan&apos;s 12 tone perfect 4ths temperament<br/>|<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         99.609 cents      99.609<br/>  2:        199.218 cents     199.218<br/>  3:        298.827 cents     298.827<br/>  4:        398.436 cents     398.436<br/>  5:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth<br/>  6:        597.654 cents     597.654<br/>  7:        697.263 cents     697.263<br/>  8:        796.872 cents     796.872<br/>  9:        896.481 cents     896.481<br/> 10:         16/9             996.090 Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 11:       1095.699 cents    1095.699<br/> 12:       1195.308 cents    1195.308</p><p>This temperament where the syntonic comma vanishes to begin with, is both a 12-tone equal division of a period that is an octave narrowed by 4.692 cents and also a perfect 4ths meantone at every key, which is a tuning that I suspect is unique and unexplored as yet.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 28 Nisan 2005 Per&scedil;embe 21:16<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Digest Number 3496</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher John Smith<br/>  &lt;christopherjohn_smith@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; Mr. Dent is using the standard terminology of traditional<br/>  theory/harmony.

It is not only inherently coinfusing, it had both of us, and<br/>  certainly Dent is included in this, confused. I mentioned The German<br/>  sixth as an example of what can only be interpreted as a septimal<br/>  chord from the common practice period. Dent responded that it was a<br/>  strong dissonance, and the French sixth even stronger. In context,<br/>  since we were talking about *psychoacoustical* dissonance, and since<br/>  the French sixth is indeed a harsher chord, this clearly carried an<br/>  implication that the French sixth was psychoacoustically rather<br/>  dissonant (which is true) and the German sixth somewhat less so (at<br/>  best confusing; the chords are not really comperable<br/>  psychoacoustically, only in terms of  functional harmony and<br/>  nomenclature.)</p><p>  &gt;A chord which in a traditional tonal context needs to be resolved is<br/>  a dissonance.</p><p>  I know that, dammit. I&apos;ve known that for years. This is not helpful.</p><p>  &gt; Sorry for butting in, but it gets really tedious wading through<br/>  endless arguments based on willful misunderstandings, or refusals to<br/>  understand, of what people say.</p><p>  Which, it seems to me, you are in danger of adding to. Could you do me<br/>  the courtesy of trying to figure out what I was saying, and why, and<br/>  not merely assume I must be ignorant?</p></div>
