Such scales have<br/>interval vectors that contain all the interval classes of the chromatic<br/>set (C) with unique multiplicity (meaning that an interval like as a<br/>major third  occurs a unique number of times compared to the number of<br/>times other intervals appear).</p><p>The interval vector is a vector whose elements are the number of times<br/>each interval of the chromatic scale (C) of which the scale is embedded<br/>or is a subset, appears. Conventionally, the intervals are ordered from<br/>1 degree to [C/2]  For example, the interval vector of the diatonic<br/>scale in 12-tet is [254361].  The interval vector of the chromatic<br/>heptachord (0 1 2 3 4 5 6) is [654321] where the generator, g, is 1<br/>degree. Two other Deep Scales exist in 12 tet: the chromatic hexachord (<br/>0 1 2 3 4 5), whose interval vector is [543210] and the hexatonic scale<br/>(0 2 4 5 7 9) with IV [143250].</p><p>Winograd described these relations originally in a hard to obtain term<br/>paper at MIT. However, Carlton Gamer discussed them at length in &quot;Some<br/>Combinational Resources of Equal-Tempered Systems,&quot; J.  1967. Journal of<br/>Music Theory 11(1): 32-59.</p><p>Needless to say, the 12 out of 19-tet MOS scale lacks this property, but<br/>Wilson&apos;s 12-tone pseudo-pythagorean MOS scale in 22 does.. Mandelbaum&apos;s<br/>9 and 10 tone &quot;Quasi-equal-interval-symmetric&quot; ( MOS where the two<br/>interval sizes differ by one unit of the temperament) scales in 19-tet<br/>are DS.</p><p>--John</p></div>
