It doesn&apos;t bother me to hear<br/>criticism of 13 or any tuning. I realise that perceptions of music<br/>vary widely. Your observations are appreciated. For me, part of the<br/>appeal of microtonal music is the insight it provides into musical<br/>perception and culture. I think microtonal music can help us to<br/>understand each other better.</p><p>I personally find some dissonant chords in 12edo to be among the most<br/>unpleasant sounds around. I even have trouble with 19edo at times. I<br/>enjoy some things about 13edo, but can well appreciate how many would<br/>find it to be unsettling.</p></div>
