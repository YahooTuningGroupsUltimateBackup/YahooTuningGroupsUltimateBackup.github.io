On any given string, this produces scale-steps<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that give close approximations to such ratios as 10/9, 7/6, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How does Robin tune his open strings?</p><p>&gt;To be honest, I&apos;ll have to write him and ask... too bad he&apos;s not<br/>&gt;on the List anymore.  As a general rule, he tunes the open strings<br/>&gt;to a JI (or pseudo-JI) chord, but of course any tuning at all can<br/>&gt;be used for the open strings, including one that more closely<br/>&gt;resembles the &apos;regular&apos; tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I wrote a very brief description of this guitar 7 months ago,<br/>&gt;right after visiting Robin during my road trip west:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; me, monz:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/8889">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/8889</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It has 3 different sizes of frets which go straight across<br/>&gt; &gt; the neck: 70 cents, 85 cents, and 115 cents, in this repeating<br/>&gt; &gt; pattern:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ||    |     |    |     |     |    |     |<br/>&gt; &gt; || 70 | 115 | 85 | 115 | 115 | 85 | 115 |<br/>&gt; &gt; ||    |     |    |     |     |    |     |<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Most of you should be able to see right away some<br/>&gt; &gt; of the just ratios that it approximates well.  The tuning of the<br/>&gt; &gt; open strings is completely &apos;user-definable&apos;, but Robin generally<br/>&gt; &gt; uses tunings which produce a nice rich JI chord on the open strings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To the best of my recollection, he tuned this particular &apos;Jinto&apos;<br/>&gt;guitar to a pseudo-JI &apos;major 9th&apos; chord.......</p><p>Yes, I still am on the list, and still, unfortunately, so swamped with L.O.T.T. (life other than tuning) my &quot;reading&quot; on the list is mostly scrolling.  My posts, such as they are, are on the skimpy side.</p><p>The tunings I used for the Just-about were, as Joe said, basically open chords.  From any fret on this guitar, you can move up in either a 1/2/5 &lt;or&gt; a 1/4/5 type progression and in some cases, both. There are many other chords accessible of course, but you really have to study the relationships to get something worthwhile out of it.  The resolution of the just-about is to the nearest five cents (240 TET).</p><p>I decided to have the guitar re-fretted the way I did because I felt that the fret spacing in the higher number E.T.s would be beyond me.  I wanted something close to 12 TET spacing.  I have since re-thought that limitation and want to get hold of a 31.  If mandolin players can get used to it, why can&apos;t I?</p><p>Robin Perry<br/>Charlottesville, VA</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>.</p><p>Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at <a href="http://profiles.msn.com">http://profiles.msn.com</a>.</p></div>
