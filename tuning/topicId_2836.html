He did not accept the fact of twelve<br/>&gt; equal semitones; he regarded it as an arbitrary division of<br/>&gt; the octave.  Nor did he accept the tempered fifth.  He<br/>&gt; repudiated the physical principles on which his art was based,<br/>&gt; and thus made a clean break with the past. Varese pointed the<br/>&gt; way to a pitchless music, with and emphasis on pure sound and<br/>&gt; rhythm, and thus led the move toward the current preoccupation<br/>&gt; of serious composers with electronic music.</p><p>[p 146: Varese]<br/>&gt;&gt; When I was around 20 [1903], I became interested in a book<br/>&gt;&gt; by Wronsky, a disciple of Kant.  Wronsky had written his own<br/>&gt;&gt; theories of philosophy, and while reading the book, I was struck<br/>&gt;&gt; by a phrase he coined to describe music.  It was this; &quot;the<br/>&gt;&gt; corporealization of the intelligence in sounds&quot;.  I liked that<br/>&gt;&gt; phrase, and later it set me to wondering what, if anything,<br/>&gt;&gt; existed between sounds; or in other words, was there a sound<br/>&gt;&gt; between the C key and C#, or a difference between C# and Db?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The question led me to Helmholtz&apos;s _Physiology of Sounds_<br/>&gt;&gt; [i.e., _On the Sensations of Tone_]; I then began to think<br/>&gt;&gt; of the opposite of sound, of silence, and of how it can be<br/>&gt;&gt; used . . . Now, to me, the climax of a crescendo can be a<br/>&gt;&gt; space of absolute silence.</p><p>Very interesting to me how he was attracted by that word<br/>&apos;corporealization&apos; (compare with Partch).</p><p>Also, he obviously had a great desire for new instruments,<br/>but never took the step that Partch took, to build them<br/>himself.</p><p>[p 147: Peyser]<br/>&gt; When Varese moved to Berlin [1907], Ferrucio Busoni&apos;s<br/>&gt; _Sketch of a New Aesthetic of Music_ [in which he describes<br/>&gt; 36-ET] had just created considerable attention in musical<br/>&gt; circles.<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>[Varese]<br/>&gt;&gt; I had read his remarkable little book, _A New Aesthetic of<br/>&gt;&gt; Music_ (another milestone in my development), and when I<br/>&gt;&gt; came across his dictum: &quot;Music was born free and to win<br/>&gt;&gt; freedom is its destiny&quot;, I was amazed and very much excited<br/>&gt;&gt; to find that there was someone besides myself - and a musician<br/>&gt;&gt; at that - who believed this.  It gave me courage to go on<br/>&gt;&gt; with my ideas and my scores.<br/>[Peyser]<br/>&gt; There were, of course, differences between the two men. Varese<br/>&gt; explains:<br/>[Varese]<br/>&gt;&gt; It was Busoni who coined the expression &apos;The New Classicism&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; and classicism new or old was what I was bent on avoiding.</p><p>After living in America, Varese and his wife moved to Paris for<br/>a few years, where he composed _Ionisation_ in 1931.  Peyser has this to<br/>say about that piece:</p><p>[p 159: Peyser]<br/>&gt; ...The title refers to atomic fission; scientists report that a<br/>&gt; recording of _Ionisation_ was frequently played at Oak Ridge<br/>&gt; while they were at work on the atom bomb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As the bomb symbolized a revolution in technology, so<br/>&gt; _Ionisation_ symbolized a revolution in music.</p><p>In 1933 the Vareses returned to New York, and he wrote<br/>a piece for a group including two Theremins, which was<br/>&apos;very badly received&apos;.</p><p>[p 160: Peyser]<br/>&gt; Receiving increasingly few performances, Varese turned again to<br/>&gt; electronics, and applied to the Guggenheim Foundation for help.<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; Although Varese applied several times...the Guggenheim<br/>&gt; characteristically denied his requests.  Desperate for a<br/>&gt; laboratory, Varese even tried to get into the Hollywood sound<br/>&gt; studios but could not interest anyone there in his ideas.  The<br/>&gt; advance in musical thoiught that had begun in the early years<br/>&gt; of the century had come to a paralyzing halt.<br/>&gt; ...Nationalism, the Depression, socialist realism and the WPA<br/>&gt; forced American music to become conservative if it was to be<br/>&gt; accepted and supported.</p><p>It&apos;s very interesting to consider how tenaciously Partch clung<br/>to his developing theories and style during this time of<br/>regression in American music.  He *received* a Guggenheim grant<br/>at this time, which enabled him to travel to Europe, research<br/>first-hand the English microtonal experiments and Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger&apos;s reconstructions of ancient Greek kitharas, and meet<br/>the poet Yeats (whose _Oedipus_ eventually formed the basis of<br/>what may be Partch&apos;s greatest masterpiece).  But Partch&apos;s grant<br/>renewal was denied the following year by an incomprensible<br/>committee who were totally lost trying to make sense of his<br/>report.</p><p>And though Peyser does not describe an _auto-da-fe_ for Varese,<br/>as someone here suggested, and as Partch actually did, she does<br/>say that:</p><p>[p161: Peyser]<br/>&gt; At this time he was profoundly depressed.<br/>[p 162]<br/>&gt; Between the middle 1930s and the late 1940s, when Varese was<br/>&gt; destroying his scores as he wrote them...</p><p>At this point in Peyser&apos;s story, she breaks away from Varese<br/>and discusses the trends in American music in the 1930s,<br/>including Cowell, Copland, and the German emigrants like<br/>Schoenberg and Hindemith; Soviet music of Prokofiev and<br/>Shostakovich; and then the post-war developments of the<br/>avant-garde in Paris and New York, spearheaded by Boulez in<br/>the one, and Babbitt and Cage in the other.</p><p>Then picking up the thread:</p><p>[p 180: Peyser]<br/>&gt; After a silence of over a decade, Varese began to respond to<br/>&gt; the awakening of interests in advanced music in 1947...</p><p>Then of course much later in life [1958] he wrote the superb<br/>_Poeme Electronique_.</p><p>[p 182: Peyser]<br/>&gt; The Pavilion brought multi-media work, electronic music,<br/>&gt; and Varese&apos;s name to the public&apos;s attention.</p><p>And in 1960 he began to receive recordings, concerts, and<br/>recognition.  After five short years of renown,</p><p>[Peyser]<br/>&gt; On November 6, 1965, Varese died after surgery for the<br/>&gt; removal of an intestinal obstruction.  + RIP</p><p>This was the composer idolized by Frank Zappa.</p><p>[The following is taken from Frank Zappa,<br/>_The Real Frank Zappa Book_.]</p><p>As a youth, Zappa was initially attracted by an album-cover<br/>photo of Varese in a record store that Zappa thought looked<br/>like a mad scientist.  His vivid teenage imagination pondered:<br/>&apos;I wonder what music composed by a mad scientists must sound<br/>like?&apos;.  But he didn&apos;t have the money to buy it.</p><p>Years later, after Zappa had stopped spending all of his time<br/>creating amateur explosive devices and had settled on an interest<br/>in music, a shop clerk put on a demo record to illustrate<br/>the quality of a hi-fi system to Zappa, and Zappa immediately<br/>fell in love with the piece and wanted to know what it was.</p><p>Sure enough, it was the very same _Ionisation_ record that<br/>he had seen as a kid.  He was astounded at the coincidence,<br/>and became a staunch champion of Varese from that day onward<br/>for the rest of his life.</p><p>I distinctly remember Zappa sponsoring and hosting a Varese<br/>memorial concert in New York in early 1981.  If I&apos;m not<br/>mistaken, it was the 20th anniversary of the first all-Varese<br/>concert in New York which Peyser cites in 1961.</p><p>It was well-attended, which one would think is a good sign.<br/>But apparently the Varese fans in the audience were vastly<br/>outnumbered by the Zappa fans (I don&apos;t think many people then<br/>were fans of both - I was, and I knew of only one other person<br/>in those days who liked both).</p><p>Unfortunately, they yelled out names of Zappa songs and in<br/>general misbehaved as they would have done at a Zappa show,<br/>expecting to hear some of his music too, rather than all Varese.</p><p>I remember Zappa in an interview afterwards being quite<br/>disillusioned and shaken by the whole experience, having<br/>expected his fans to revere Varese in the same way he did.</p><p>If I recall correctly, that was the end of his *actively*<br/>trying to turn the public on to his favorite composer&apos;s great<br/>work.  The cause he took up in the 1980s was the fight against<br/>laws which would require profanity warning labels on records.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

It is a 16 bar chart in 4/4 for 8<br/>musicians and is self-described by Varese as an &quot;experiment.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve arranged it for performance 4 times, the last in Paris (which received a<br/>good mention in Le Monde).  Of the 8 parts, only one (#5) is listed<br/>specfically, and only as percussion.   The graphics fit within 3 lines that<br/>delineate an instrument&apos;s lowest, middle, and highest rage.</p><p>Varese had become disappointed with conventional musicians and stopped<br/>writing.  This piece was aimed at Charlie Mingus&apos; big band.  After having<br/>performed the work twice I got to hear a private tape of Varese conducting<br/>jazz musicians in his &quot;experiment&quot; but the players didn&apos;t really want to try<br/>very hard.  After an hour they are where my AFMMers begin.  And the<br/>complaining!?!</p><p>On May 30th, I am schedule to perform a new piece based on these graphics in<br/>Moscow.  &quot;Varese Variation&quot; for Theremin and Electric Bassoon arranged from<br/>Edgard Varese by Johnny Reinhard.  Actually it&apos;s _all_ Varese.  I even have a<br/>taste of percussion.  Oh, and my thereminist is none other than Lydia Kavina<br/>(#1).  Still making parts.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
