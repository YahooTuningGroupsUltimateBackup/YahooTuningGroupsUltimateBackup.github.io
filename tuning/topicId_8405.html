You know, I&apos;d swear that I could throw together most any set of<br/>seven notes and so long as the size of the smallest step doesn&apos;t get<br/>down to about the size of say a quartertone, that I could make music<br/>that at *least* 9 out of 10 listeners (OK, 7 out of 10 musicians)<br/>wouldn&apos;t notice as being &quot;irrelevant to diatonic music,&quot; or &quot;only<br/>involved in functional _dissonances_.&quot; Now I&apos;m being a bit of a<br/>facetious pain in the a** here of course, but theoretical arguments of<br/>this sort, so categorically stated, do tend to make the hairs on the<br/>back of my neck bristle! I also bet you could find plenty of examples<br/>where 7-limit ratios and fixed 12-tET are coexisting in some mutually<br/>understood -- and *musical* -- balance. Now I suppose one would<br/>probably just call these inflections, blue notes and the like,<br/>however, I don&apos;t think they&apos;d be (or should be) called &quot;irrelevant to<br/>diatonic music.&quot; Maybe we&apos;re just not on the same page with the term<br/>&quot;diatonic music?&quot; Actually, I&apos;m probably just chronically prone to<br/>claustrophobic episodes when exposed to certain strains of<br/>incontestable assertions - an allergic reaction to particular<br/>theoretical and aesthetic restrictions perhaps? Most likely. Anyway, I<br/>do like theory and knowledgeable reliable sorts who generally tend to<br/>espouse it, and in this respect I&apos;m really really glad to see Dave<br/>back and regularly contributing to the TD, but hey, if you&apos;ve got a<br/>particular allergy, certain allergens are bound to trigger an allergic<br/>reaction...</p><p>Dan (Sneezy) Stearns</p></div>
