His own solo recording Voyage that never ends , does<br/>not do him justice and often his playing with terry seems to degenerate<br/>with terry stepping all over him as if everyone is supposed to just<br/>follow him.</p><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; Grillo has incredible mastery of playing harmonics.<br/>&gt; So much of _fluvine_ is tuned in the harmonic subset<br/>&gt; of low-integer JI...
