I am<br/>17yo from NC. I started playing guitar 2 years ago, and piano 10<br/>years ago. I started writing music several years before I started<br/>playing guitar, but never went anywhere with it. In the last few<br/>months, I have started to write songs more naturally, and readliy.<br/>Here is one of my first songs(it is as of yet, still unfinished):</p><p>Verse:<br/>Our grandfathers were dirty, rotten bigots<br/>And our fathers too, they learned it from their dads<br/>Now its just me and you, were fighting over nothing<br/>Where did you think we got it from</p><p>Middle 8:<br/>We follow in their footsteps<br/>We make the same mistakes<br/>History has tought us nothing<br/>Except to fight each day we wake</p><p>Here it returns to the verse with several word changes, then back<br/>to the mid-8. It ends with the mid-8 up 1\2 to 1 step with different<br/>words, but you can get the jist of the song here.</p><p>Please send me your thoughts.<br/>I will try to post a clip of this later if you guys would like to<br/>hear it.<br/>Thanks,<br/>St&iacute;ofa&iacute;n, L&iacute;am &Oacute; Murchada</p></div>
