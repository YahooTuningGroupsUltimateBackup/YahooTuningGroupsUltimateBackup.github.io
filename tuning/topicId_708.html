The diatonic genus is the<br/>&gt; &gt; one whose tetrachord has, as  Chalmers puts it, a whole tone as a<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;characteristic interval&apos;. This whole tone ranges in size from ca. 10/9 to<br/>&gt; &gt; ca. 8/7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf,<br/>&gt; It seems that neither the Greeks nor you assume the tone could be 256/243 . :- )<br/>&gt; Tthis problem began for me more than 20 years.  Mr Manuel Fernadez Spiro,<br/>&gt; professor, composer, pianist, a gentelman, (in 1910, or so,  he knew Claude Debussy<br/>&gt; in Paris)   taught me harmony.<br/>&gt; He told me that the word &quot;Diatonic&quot; means &quot;by tones&quot;, and I believe that&apos;s right,<br/>&gt; but I&apos;m not absolutely sure..<br/>&gt; Just this morning I called by phone Ing. Julio Vales (Golden Medal Facultad de<br/>&gt; Ingenieria) and I asked him about the etymological meaning of the word Diatonic. He<br/>&gt; has an Antique Greek -- Spanish dictionary (nuestro lenguaje es Espanol) (Ed. 1988,<br/>&gt; about 35.000 words) and told me that the word diatonic (or related) didn&apos;t appear.<br/>&gt; But  &quot;dia&quot; means, a traves, separada, en dos partes, en pedazos that translated<br/>&gt; means through, separated, in two parts, in fragments.<br/>&gt; I suppose that several of these meanings may correspond to &quot;by&quot;.<br/>&gt; As this is my point of departure I ask you  Daniel Wolf, would you tell me what do<br/>&gt; you think about ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Eduardo</p><p>&gt; Message: 2<br/>&gt;    Date: Sun, 7 Feb 1999 11:28:48 -0500<br/>&gt;    From: Daniel Wolf &lt;<a href="mailto:DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com">DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 42, Daniel Wolf<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Diatonic does translate as &apos;by&apos; or &apos;through&apos; or &apos;by means of tones&apos;.<br/>&gt; Dividing the tetrachord by successive tones -- of whatever exact size --<br/>&gt; will leave a remainder of -- some kind of -- a semitone. That remainder<br/>&gt; will never be a tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In your example, the ditone diatonic, successive 9/8 tones leave a semitone<br/>&gt; remainder of 256/243.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Part of the usage trouble with the term &apos;tone&apos; has to do with the fact that<br/>&gt; it is used as &apos;interval&apos; in some contexts and &apos;pitch&apos; in others. Yes, on<br/>&gt; each division of the tetrachord is found a tone=pitch, but no, these tones=pitches<br/>&gt; are not always a tone=interval away from one another.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Daniel Wolf ,</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m in accord with you.<br/>From the first time I heard the meaning of the word Diatonic (20 years ago) as &quot;by<br/>tones&quot; the obvious first question was about the interpretation of the word because in<br/>all the diatonic scales there are always two kind of tone-intervals the whole tone (as<br/>you say from ca. 10/9 to ca. 9/8) and  the semitone (or around of).<br/>The diatonic scales are not by whole tones, they have two semitones.<br/>A without-any-doubt &quot;by tones &quot; scale is the root 6 of 2, or all the arrangements you<br/>surely know better than me.<br/>(In this moment I just made some numbers and I found that five 9/8 plus one 10/9 gives<br/>one Octave plus a rational Skhisma !  ).   Interesting.<br/>The other possibility we have to evaluate this matter is to consider the tone (of<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; word) as a tone-pitch. If we consider this possibility from (I imagine) the<br/>theoreticians point of view  (either from Greek times or Tuning Digest List) we enter<br/>in the chicken paradox. But It&apos;s probable that this name comes from the musicians of<br/>those times (whose they knew few of Physics theory) and latter the theoreticians from<br/>Greece or Alexandria have made an academical use or definition.<br/>It&apos;s important to think that from Pythagoras to Ptolemy there are about 8 centuries,<br/>and in that time the languages and the meaning of the words changes a lot</p><p>Eduardo</p></div>
