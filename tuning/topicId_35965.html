While staying in Leipzig, we will visit Weimar, Arnstadt, and<br/>Muhlhausen on day trips.  Afterwards, I will be in Berlin for 2 days,<br/>Hamburg, and then ending up in Nederland (as they call it).</p><p>There I will visit with Siem Terpstra and bring back to New York is 2 models<br/>for a generalized microtonal with the intention of building them (or more<br/>accurately, having them built).  It is a modified Bosanquet design that<br/>divides cyclic tunings from overtone generated tunings into 2 distinct<br/>physical models.  I am pleased to announce there is a grant in place to built<br/>a set or two.</p><p>I will try to keep in contact by email while taking in the sights and sounds.<br/> I&apos;m bringing my Werckmeister-tuned alto recorder so that I can play Bach<br/>Brandenburg #4 for people to demonstrate easily what I am after, and to<br/>discover if there is a vestige of it remaining in the cities where Bach<br/>worked the longest.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>p.s.  Before the opening April 30th MicroFest 2002 in New York, Anastasia<br/>Solberg and I will present the complete Li Po in Liberty, NY on April 20th.<br/>It opens a 4-day poetry festival in Liberty&apos;s main book store.</p></div>
