It struck me, however, that practically<br/>NONE of the pieces in Volume I, which contains Oriental, Medieval and<br/>Renaissance music, would be in the tuning system implied by the notation:<br/>12-tET.</p><p>I wonder if scholars today would be a bit more &quot;sensitive&quot; to this<br/>question, and whether more recent compendiums indicate tunings a bit more<br/>than this one does... which, indeed, wouldn&apos;t have to be much, since in<br/>this case it is almost none...</p><p>As I think about it, I don&apos;t believe tuning was ever ONCE mentioned in any<br/>class I ever took in Medieval or Renaissance music (not at really bad<br/>places, either...).  I do not exaggerate.</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t it be great [&quot;kuyl&quot;] in this day of synthesizers if a compendium<br/>like this could indicate a tuning table in cents, or something of the kind<br/>-- even a generalized description [&quot;i.e. &apos;meantone&apos;&quot;] so people could play<br/>through on the keyboard something that would at least approximate the<br/>original??</p><p>I wonder if this is being done, or anyone has thought of it...

But your point<br/>about the relationship between the notation system and 12tet is historically<br/>backwards.</p><p>The familiar notation system used for 12tet predates 12tet.  This notation<br/>is basically pythagorean, extending indefinitely by fifths in either<br/>direction through the addition of sharps and flats. When mapped onto<br/>meantone, which has one size of fifths, this indefinite extension is<br/>preserved but the relationship of sharps to flats flips over (i.e. in<br/>meantone db is higher in pitch than c#). When mapped onto 12tet, so-called<br/>enharmonic equivalence is introduced and the chain of fifths becomes a<br/>closed cycle of 12 members.</p></div>
