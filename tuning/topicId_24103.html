Where would we be without you, Manuel.</p><p>Thanks to all of those who helped Ara Sarkissian get Scala up and<br/>running on his machine. I went throught the tutorial, and had some<br/>comments.</p><p>SHOW DATA</p><p>- The word &quot;interval&quot; in the first part of the output means &quot;step&quot;,<br/>while in the second part of the output it really means &quot;interval&quot;.<br/>This is potentially very confusing.</p><p>- It is easy to show that the least squares estimator of a quantity<br/>is simply its mean. Hence it&apos;s odd that &quot;least squares average<br/>interval&quot; is different from &quot;average interval&quot; -- and both should<br/>really say &quot;step&quot; or something rather than &quot;interval&quot;.</p><p>- The example given is a 12-tone Pythagorean scale. SHOW DATA says<br/>it&apos;s maximally even. Maximal evenness, though, is only defined<br/>relative to a larger chromatic universe. The next line of output says<br/>that the scale is a subset of 665-tET. But it&apos;s _not_ a maximally<br/>even subset of 665-tET. So something&apos;s wrong.</p><p>- Odd number limit . . . Why is the &quot;O&quot; limit different than the &quot;U&quot;<br/>limit? The Pythagorean scale is symmetrical as to otonality or<br/>utonality -- these should be the same.</p><p>EQUAL/DATA</p><p>- Highest harmonic represented uniquely O . . . O/U . . . the first<br/>doesn&apos;t seem right at all. Perhaps you mean highest harmonic<br/>represented uniquely when octave equivalence is not assumed, and then<br/>where it is assumed?</p><p>- Pyth. third up, Pyth. third down. This doesn&apos;t make any sense.<br/>Perhaps you mean Pyth. major third, Pyth. dim. fourth?</p><p>- Pythagorean means a chain of 3/2s. Pythagorean in your program<br/>means a linear tuning with any generator. If you call the Pythagorean<br/>diminished fourth a Pythagorean &quot;third down&quot;, that&apos;s like three<br/>meanings of Pythagorean. The popular account, unfortunately, is that<br/>Pythagorean means all simple ratios, including 5/4. Stop the<br/>confusion!</p><p>CHORD</p><p>- Added sixth &amp; ninth -- it looks like you&apos;re using a just<br/>interpretation of this chord where the sixth and ninth are a 27:20<br/>apart -- I object strongly; that&apos;s very ugly -- this is not a JI<br/>chord!</p><p>Hope you take these criticisms with the highest respect for the work<br/>you have done and know that it is our common desire to make these<br/>concepts as accessible to as many users as possible.</p><p>Thanks!</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>6/1/2001 5:09:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>Thanks for your comments.</p><p>&gt;- The word &quot;interval&quot; in the first part of the output means &quot;step&quot;,<br/>&gt;while in the second part of the output it really means &quot;interval&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;ll change the wording.</p><p>&gt;- It is easy to show that the least squares estimator of a quantity<br/>&gt;is simply its mean.

I still think this should come out equal to<br/>&gt;the average interval -- you can reply with a fuller clarification on<br/>&gt;the tuning-math list.</p><p>Ok, it&apos;s not so difficult. Imagine the scale in the X-Y plane.<br/>Horizontally the degree numbers and vertically pitch in cents. Then<br/>imagine the straight line going through the origin and coming as close<br/>as possible to the points that represent the tones. Some points will be<br/>above the line and some below. If it would be equal to the average<br/>interval, the line would go through the octave point, which is not<br/>required.</p><p>&gt;So what&apos;s &quot;it&quot;? What property _does_ the Pythagorean 12-tone scale<br/>&gt;have that you were testing for here?</p><p>I was taking maximal evenness out of the ET-subset context. Because it<br/>bothered me that a scale could me ME in N-tET, while the same scale<br/>wouldn&apos;t be ME in 2*N-tET. So I replaced the one step difference<br/>requirement with the requirement that L/S &lt;= 2.</p><p>&gt;Well, that&apos;s what I meant by octave-equivalence. Octave-equivalence<br/>&gt;of pitches, which implies inversional equivalence of intervals. So,<br/>&gt;why the terms O and O/U? These have nothing to do with the<br/>&gt;distinction between inversional equivalence and lack thereof.</p><p>With O and U I meant overtonal and undertonal. To take a simple example,<br/>in 4-tET, the nearest step to the 3rd overtone (mod octave: 3/2) is 600<br/>cents.<br/>The nearest step to the 3rd undertone (mod octave: 4/3) is also 600 cents.<br/>So the 3rd harmonic is not represented uniquely O/U in 4-tET.</p><p>&gt;Can you post the list?</p><p>Ok, reluctantly because of the length. I haven&apos;t put a lot of work in it,<br/>so it could grow considerably. Could somebody check &quot;the&quot; Sacre chord,<br/>because I&apos;ve seen it mentioned differently.</p><p>Manuel</p><p>! chordnam.par by Manuel Op de Coul, 2000<br/>!

There are four different ways to specify a chord in this file:<br/>! - As a list of absolute frequency ratios separated by colons, like<br/>!   4:5:6<br/>! - As a list of relative intervals in cents or as a ratio, like<br/>!   50.0 50.0 400.0 or 28/27 36/35 5/4<br/>! - As a list of relative steps of an equal temperament separated by dashes,<br/>!   like 4-3-3. Which equal temperament to be used should be specified by a<br/>!   statement like &lt;SCALA_SCALE_DEF 2^(1/31)&gt;<br/>! - As a list of tones in a certain notation system (see command SET NOTATION)<br/>!   separated by spaces, like C Eb G Bb. The octave can also be specified if<br/>!   necessary with a period, like F.-1 C.0 F.0 C.1<br/>!   The notation system to be used should be specified by a statement like<br/>!   &lt;SCALA_NOTATION E31&gt;<br/>! The rest of the line with the chord must contain the chord name. If it<br/>! begins with a digit, then the name must be preceded by a &apos;=&apos;-character.<br/>!

Imagine the scale in the X-Y plane.<br/>&gt; Horizontally the degree numbers and vertically pitch in cents. Then<br/>&gt; imagine the straight line going through the origin and coming as<br/>close<br/>&gt; as possible to the points that represent the tones. Some points<br/>will be<br/>&gt; above the line and some below. If it would be equal to the average<br/>&gt; interval, the line would go through the octave point, which is not<br/>&gt; required.</p><p>Can you write me off-list, or on the still-extant tuning-math list,<br/>with a simple, perhaps pentatonic, example? I need to see the details<br/>of what you&apos;re doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So what&apos;s &quot;it&quot;? What property _does_ the Pythagorean 12-tone scale<br/>&gt; &gt;have that you were testing for here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was taking maximal evenness out of the ET-subset context. Because<br/>it<br/>&gt; bothered me that a scale could me ME in N-tET, while the same scale<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t be ME in 2*N-tET. So I replaced the one step difference<br/>&gt; requirement with the requirement that L/S &lt;= 2.</p><p>Ah . . . there may be a name for the property that you thought was<br/>ME. Ask John Chalmers. It may be equivalent to a logical AND of<br/>propreity and distributional evenness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Well, that&apos;s what I meant by octave-equivalence. Octave-equivalence<br/>&gt; &gt;of pitches, which implies inversional equivalence of intervals. So,<br/>&gt; &gt;why the terms O and O/U? These have nothing to do with the<br/>&gt; &gt;distinction between inversional equivalence and lack thereof.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With O and U I meant overtonal and undertonal. To take a simple<br/>example,<br/>&gt; in 4-tET, the nearest step to the 3rd overtone (mod octave: 3/2) is<br/>600<br/>&gt; cents.<br/>&gt; The nearest step to the 3rd undertone (mod octave: 4/3) is also 600<br/>cents.<br/>&gt; So the 3rd harmonic is not represented uniquely O/U in 4-tET.</p><p>Manuel, I think you&apos;re falling into the trap of thinking of dyads as<br/>otonal or utonal, that I keep talking about on the list. Any dyad is<br/>equally otonal _and_ utonal . . . only triads can lean toward one or<br/>the other characterization. But even so, this explanation would seem<br/>to fall short. For example, can you explain the 19-tET case in this<br/>way? It&apos;s really inversional equivalence of intervals, and hence<br/>octave equivalence of pitches, that differentiates the two cases, not<br/>otonal/utonal considerations . . . right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Can you post the list?</p><p>I&apos;ll take a look at this . . . and of course I&apos;ll have some 22-tET,<br/>31-tET, and 72-tET chords to add.</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>6/6/2001 4:48:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;Can you write me off-list, or on the still-extant tuning-math list,<br/>&gt;with a simple, perhaps pentatonic, example?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt;Ah . . . there may be a name for the property that you thought was<br/>&gt;ME.
