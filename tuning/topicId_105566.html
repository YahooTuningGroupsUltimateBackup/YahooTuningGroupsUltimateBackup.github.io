Just the two examples given above are more than enough to illustrate the point.</p><p>Werckmeister III</p><p>What is this? One might be mislead into thinking that this is some sort of historical temperament authored by some guy named Werckmeister who proposed 3 temperaments, and this is the third of those 3. Nothing could be further from the truth, as many of you know - but far more people don&apos;t know! 99% of the time this means the modern misinterpretation of the third set of monochord lengths in his 1691 Musikalisches Temperatur (thus the &quot;III&quot;), which is actually his first &quot;rechte&quot; temperament, which is also his first temperament in his 1681 Orgelprobe. But this ubiquitous modern misinterpretation substitutes 1/4 Pythagorean comma for Werckmeister&apos;s original 1/4 Syntonic. So why not let this modern fantasy die the death it rightfully deserves and use the opportunity of establishing a correct terminology to simultaneously restore the actual temperament? What to call it then? The main problem is that it is open to interpretation, as so many historical temperaments are (Bendeler, for example). So, if you only want to vaguely refer to it without pinning it down, the possibilities could be:</p><p>Werckmeister 1681-I<br/>Werckmeister 1691 Monochord III<br/>Werckmeister 1691 &quot;Rechte I&quot;</p><p>If you want to actually pin it down to hard numbers, you would have to call it something like:</p><p>Werckmeister/(Your Name Here) 1681 &quot;Rechte I&quot;</p><p>...since your idea of how to resolve the schisma is not necessarily gonna be the same as someone else&apos;s.</p><p>This is of absolutely necessity in regards to Schlick, for example, or the French modified meantones, or Werckmeister&apos;s continuo temperament (far more important than his I/III eve was), all of which REQUIRE interpretation, and therefore MUST carry a second author&apos;s name any time it is presented as hard values. For if such values are simply presented with only the original author&apos;s name, it is a willful falsification of the historical reality. Bendeler is particular tricky because he states that the comma he is dividing is the Syntonic, like Werckmeister, leaving the schisma to disappear in the wash. But if you follow his tuning instructions to the letter, you&apos;re much more likely to end up doing a Pythagorean comma division. So it&apos;s up to you, but no one solution is true Bendeler.</p><p>Young&apos;s Well Temperament</p><p>This abomination should be eradicated once and for all from all future writings on temperament. What in bluhdy hell is it supposed to be? His real temperament? Doubtful, since almost no one talks about that! More likely, it means the ubiquitous modern misinterpretation of his real temperament, which like &quot;Werckmeister III&quot;, confuses the Pythagorean comma for the Syntonic. But it could just as well be that compromise he suggested as being &quot;almost as good as&quot; his real temperament, i.e. that boring 1/6th P comma regular circulating thingee.</p><p>The worst aspect of such a terminology, though, is this word &quot;Well&quot;. What, pray tell, is a &quot;Well&quot; temperament? It is usually taken to be some sort of circulating thingee, usually assumed to be P. comma based. Some say all the fifths must be narrow. Others say some can be larger than pure, (as with Werckmeister&apos;s other &quot;rechte&quot; temperaments, which almost no one ever talks about), it must simply circulate. But circulate how? No bad fifth? No really bad third? This terminology also implies that it has some connection with Bach, which of course, no surviving historical temperament does objectively. Ultimately, the word &quot;Well&quot; is completely empty of any real meaning. It is vapid puffery, designed to lend a temperament an air of authenticity. It is so void of any real content, we may as well substitute it with freely-chosen nonsense gibberish:</p><p>Young&apos;s Slithytove</p><p>or</p><p>Young&apos;s Dallydingdong</p><p>The worst part of this terminology is that it was obviously thought-up by some cretin (I would honestly like to know who was the dim bulb who coined this phrase!) who did not know the difference between and adjective and adverb. In addition to being a linguistic monstrosity, it has no basis in historical literature; the old authors, who knew how to speak proper German, called them Rechte (proper) or Gute (good) temperaments. Any time you utter the words &quot;well temperament&quot;, anyone with a well-education... oops, I meant anybody good-educated... cringes.</p><p>So let&apos;s please just start calling the two temperaments proposed by Young by what they are:</p><p>Young&apos;s preferred temperament vs. Young&apos;s compromise, for example.</p><p>Or, if you want to be more exacting:</p><p>Young&apos;s 3/16th S. comma circulating and Young&apos;s 1/6 P. comma circulating</p><p>Actually, Young&apos;s preferred temperament is a modified meantone, but that&apos;s another rant altogether.</p><p>Using such terms, we know precisely which temperament you are talking about, and whether you have actually taken the effort to go read what Young himself actually said (which ain&apos;t much effort these days) or just regurgitating some modern mumbo-jumbo you&apos;ve gleaned from the back pages of a Korg tuner user&apos;s manual.</p><p>And let&apos;s don&apos;t even talk about the ubiquitous modern two-headed Hydra &quot;Young/Vallotti&quot;.</p><p>The problem is that all this bad terminology along with the just-as-often-as-not incorrect temperament data to which it is attached has become so entrenched in the modern literature that modern HIPP musicians start using it/them thinking they are doing something historical. Or worse yet, well-meaning (or should I say good-meaning?) scientists relie on these sources for &quot;historical temperament&quot; data, undermining the academic credibility of otherwise possibly-interesting studies in perception and such. I realize that trying to set things aright at this late date is pissing against the wind, but it is an ill wind indeed, and it blows no one any good. I&apos;m gonna keep on pissing, myself...</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=105575 href="#105575">ðŸ”—</a>Ryan Avella &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2012 2:08:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot;  wrote:<br/>&gt;Also, I note that there are several names of JI scales or tempered scales (not temperaments)<br/>&gt;that are well-established but don&apos;t conform to these.
