Margo, all the<br/>evidence seems to completely support your statements.</p><p>This morning, just a few hours before receiving my Tuning<br/>Digest and reading your posting, I have had a major new<br/>insight into Marchetto&apos;s theories, so everything in my<br/>webpage is possibly incorrect!</p><p>I will not delete it, however, because there is no way to<br/>be certain, and there is still a possibility that what I<br/>have there is correct.  But my new interpretation of<br/>Marchetto&apos;s &apos;fifth-tones&apos; fits all the evidence better,<br/>and strongly supports a 17-tone Pythagorean chromatic scale<br/>(I can almost see you grinning!).</p><p>Since my translations of the selections of Euler&apos;s Latin<br/>in my recent work on that webpage turned out so well (IMO),<br/>and revealed subtle shades of meaning to me that I did not<br/>get from Professor Bailhache&apos;s translations, I decided to<br/>translate Marchetto&apos;s Latin for myself too.</p><p>I am glad that I decided to do this.  I roundly criticize<br/>Jan Herlinger for the interpretation of the &apos;fifth-tones&apos;<br/>as an equal-tempered division of the &apos;whole tone&apos; [= (9/8)^(1/5)],<br/>and had a suspicion that the English translation of Marchetto&apos;s<br/>_Lucidarium_ by Herlinger, in the critical edition, may not<br/>pick up on some of the finer points of tuning.</p><p>I was certainly correct about that.</p><p>Marchetto, in Treatise 2 chapter 4, is discussing the way<br/>that the continuum keeps getting smaller as one takes<br/>8/9, and then 8/9 of 8/9, and so on, which was the standard<br/>Pythagorean way of building a scale by monochord division.</p><p>So I applied this method to the division of the whole tone,<br/>instead of the 9 equal string-length divisions which I<br/>present on my webpage now, and I discovered something amazing.</p><p>With this method of division, Marchetto got a diesis at<br/>the end which was much larger than all the rest (92 cents!<br/>- the others are 22, 37, 30, and 24 cents), and ratios<br/>with some very high prime factors: his &apos;enharmonic semitone&apos;<br/>is 182/173 [= 2^1 * 7^1 * 13^1 * 173^-1] and his &apos;chromatic<br/>semitone&apos; is 577/541 [= 541^-1 * 577^1].</p><p>However, they describe perfectly the method of Pythagorean<br/>chromaticism in the early 1300s, with only ~2 cents error.</p><p>It is important to remember, as I point out on the webpage,<br/>that accidentals at that time period did not mean the same<br/>thing they mean today.  They signified not an absolute<br/>pitch value or pitch-class, but rather a variety of different<br/>&apos;mutations&apos; which produced chromatic melodic progressions.</p><p>According to my new rational interpretation, the uses of<br/>Marchetto&apos;s four different small intervals can be summarized<br/>as follows, using regular Pythagorean terminology for<br/>&apos;natural&apos;, &apos;flat&apos;, and &apos;sharp&apos;:</p><p>diatonic semitone (~116 cents)<br/>= from flat to natural above, or natural to flat below</p><p>enharmonic semitone (~88 cents)<br/>= from natural to flat above, or flat to natural below</p><p>chromatic semitone (~112 cents)<br/>= from natural to sharp above, or sharp to natural below</p><p>diesis (~92 cents)<br/>= from sharp to natural above, or natural to sharp below</p><p>It turns out that the &apos;chromatic&apos; and &apos;diatonic&apos; semitones<br/>are very close in size: only ~4 cents difference.  But they<br/>were differentiated by Marchetto because his perspective<br/>on accidentals was different from ours: the diatonic could<br/>only appear in conjunction with the enharmonic, and the<br/>chromatic only with the diesis, in specified melodic settings<br/>which Marchetto illustrates in the remainder of _Lucidarium_.</p><p>The vertical intervals (harmonies/ dyads) produced thru use<br/>of the chromatic semitone are not the unusual ones expanded<br/>by approximately a &apos;quarter-tone&apos;, but simply the regular<br/>Pythagorean *major* &apos;3rds&apos; and &apos;6ths&apos; minus ~2 cents (in places<br/>where these intervals would normally be of the &apos;minor&apos; variety).</p><p>The 1962 article &apos;On the development of musical systems&apos;,<br/>by Kraehenbuehl and Schmidt, [Journal of Music Theory, vol 6,<br/>p 32-65] describes how Prosdocimus calculated the 17-tone<br/>Pythagorean scale by inserting a sharp *and* flat between<br/>all 7 of the regular Pythagorean diatonic notes.</p><p>Prosdocimus wrote his book about 100 years after Marchetto,<br/>and was bitterly attacking Marchetto&apos;s theories.  But I can<br/>see, using this interpretation of Marchetto&apos;s divisions, that<br/>Marchetto was describing a very close approximation to exactly<br/>the same process which Prosdocimus &apos;corrected&apos; (i.e., made<br/>strictly 3-limit).</p><p>I think this gives further validation to this new interpretation.</p><p>So, if this interpretation of his divisions is correct,<br/>and I think it is, he was not theorizing about 5-limit (JI)<br/>intervals at all, but merely describing the introduction<br/>of chromaticism into the music of his day within the<br/>Pythagorean system.</p><p>Nor did his &apos;chromatic semitone&apos; indicate some pitch<br/>sharpened by about a &apos;quarter-tone&apos;.</p><p>I personally am a little disappointed about both of those,<br/>but it is still a very clever theory.</p><p>And the accepted view on Marchetto&apos;s &apos;fifth-tones&apos;,<br/>Herlinger&apos;s, is in serious need of correction.</p><p>Also, Jay Rahn published his article on Marchetto in<br/>Music Theory Online last December, with exactly the same<br/>measurements I discuss on my webpage now.  This view<br/>also needs to be emended.</p><p>This new information will be added to the Marchetto<br/>webpage over the next few days, as well as much of the<br/>Latin and my translation.</p><p>-Joe</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>4/28/1999 6:40:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I realized that this table could be made a bit more clear<br/>with the addition of example notes with letter-names:</p><p>&gt; diatonic semitone (~116 cents)<br/>&gt; = from flat to natural above, or natural to flat below<br/>i.e., Bb-&gt;B or B-&gt;Bb</p><p>&gt; enharmonic semitone (~88 cents)<br/>&gt; = from natural to flat above, or flat to natural below<br/>i.e., A-&gt;Bb or Bb-&gt;A</p><p>&gt; chromatic semitone (~112 cents)<br/>&gt; = from natural to sharp above, or sharp to natural below<br/>i.e., A-&gt;A# or A#-&gt;A</p><p>&gt; diesis (~92 cents)<br/>&gt; = from sharp to natural above, or natural to sharp below<br/>i.e., A#-&gt;B or B-&gt;A#</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>4/30/1999 2:36:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; [I] had a suspicion that the English translation of Marchetto&apos;s<br/>&gt; _Lucidarium_ by Herlinger, in the critical edition, may not<br/>&gt; pick up on some of the finer points of tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was certainly correct about that.</p><p>In all fairness to Herlinger, I must say that the translation<br/>of Marchetto is actually quite good and very accurate.</p><p>The only real improvement, at least regarding Treatise 2,<br/>is that following Marchetto&apos;s wording and punctuation more<br/>closely brings out the manner of his monochord division<br/>more clearly.</p><p>This is decisively important, because he does not quantify<br/>any of these measurements with numbers other than the<br/>discussion of the 8:9 proportion and successive division<br/>by 9.</p><p>Herlinger clearly failed to understand this method,<br/>calling Marchetto&apos;s division of the 5 dieses &quot;numerological<br/>considerations, not quantitative measurements&quot; [footnote g,<br/>p 135].</p><p>On the contrary, they are exactly quantified measurements.<br/>They were just described very vaguely in words by Marchetto,<br/>and more vaguely by Herlinger&apos;s translation.</p><p>Marchetto probably *could* have learned to express the<br/>manner of his division more exactly, but Latin theorists<br/>of this period generally resorted to one-word Latin names<br/>for particular (actually, superparticular  &lt;  {;^)   &gt;)<br/>ratios, and Marchetto was no exception.</p><p>And if my new interpretation turns out to be incorrect,<br/>then my old one is certainly right, and Herlinger&apos;s is still<br/>wrong.

What makes it really irksome is that he<br/>&gt; writes &quot;the first part is the first diesis&quot;, and then<br/>&gt; describes the other four dieses as &quot;from the first to<br/>&gt; the third&quot;, &quot;from the third to the fifth&quot;, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So in a flash of sudden insight, i realized that perhaps<br/>&gt; he was thinking of the integers the old-fashioned way,<br/>&gt; that is, _without zero as part of the set_!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If he started by counting the whole monochord string<br/>&gt; as the &quot;first part&quot; -- instead of the &quot;zeroeth part&quot;<br/>&gt; as we would do it today (and as i did in my webpage<br/>&gt; diagrams) -- then he could have a 9-part division<br/>&gt; of the whole-tone by labeling the divisions thus:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (use the &quot;Option&quot; and &quot;Use Fixed Width Font&quot; links if<br/>&gt; viewing this on the Yahoo website)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 72 . 71 . 70 . 69 . 68 . 67 . 66 . 65 . 64 -- arithmetic part<br/>&gt; 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4 .. 5 .. 6 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9 --- Marchetto &quot;part&quot;<br/>&gt; 1 ....... 2 ....... 3 ....... 4 ....... 5 --- Marchetto diesis<br/>&gt; 0 ....... 49 ...... 99 ...... 151 ..... 204 - ~cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is the proper interpretation, then all Marchetto<br/>&gt; was doing after all, was describing what are essentially<br/>&gt; quarter-tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No great argument from me yet in support of this<br/>&gt; interpretation -- it&apos;s just another of the many<br/>&gt; possibilities i and others have already thought up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To Robert:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From Robert.

In your interpretation, we take the whole tone as an interval and dieses as degrees of the whole tone division instead of intervals. In an age of Pythagoreanism, I do not think defending quarter-tones makes much sense.</p><p>Let us analyze the quotes I copied from your website:</p><p>&quot;Because the aforesaid chromatic, diatonic, and enharmonic [species] cannot be fully treated until the whole tone is examined (since they are semitones), we shall first study the nature of the whole tone and how it is divided by numbers.&quot;</p><p>The first critical information we glean from this statement is that the chromatic, diatonic and enharmonic are all semitones, meaning half the whole tone.</p><p>&quot;We acknowledge therefore that the parts of itself will have to be inequalities, so that 1 is the first part; from 1 to 3, the second; from the 3 to 5, the third; from 5 to 7, the fourth; from 7 to 9, the fifth; and such 5th part is the fifth odd number of the total 9.&quot;</p><p>As you demonstrated:</p><p>1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4 .. 5 .. 6 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9 --- Marchetto &quot;part&quot;<br/>1 ....... 2 ....... 3 ....... 4 ....... 5 --- Marchetto diesis</p><p>However, the word &quot;inequalities&quot; clearly implies that the parts are to be unequal in size. I believe, contrary to my previous assumption, that the 1-3 and 3-5 parts are smaller than 7-9 and 5-7 is even smaller. This means that Marchetto is concentrating the semitones in the center region of half the wholetone and that the 5th diesis is very large.</p><p>&quot;Any fifth part as it is desired, may be called a diesis, whether the lowest (smallest?) or the highest (largest?) division, this is the most important division that can be obtained in singing a tone.&quot;</p><p>Marchetto ascribes great importance to the diesis, which seems to change drastically in size. He says, &quot;maior divisio&quot;. It is translated here as the most important division, but I dare say he is quite literal about it. I think he means that the first, second and fifth diese are fairly large, considering that he is talking about singers and given the previous criterion on attaining semitones.</p><p>&quot;It is true that from three of these dieses a diatonic semitone is made. This is the larger [semitone] which is called the major apotome. It is the larger part of the tone divided in two.&quot;</p><p>He clearly divides the whole tone into two (possibly arithmetically) and wants us to recognize the major apotome/diatonic semitone as the larger (but not the largest) semitone part composed of three dieses. He says major apatome, not apatome plainly, which means that we are talking about an interval larger than 2187:2048.</p><p>&quot;The diatonic semitone occurs when a permutation is made from round b to square b or vice versa, whether in ascent or descent, as here [musical example]:&quot;</p><p>a..bb..b..c<br/>a..G...E..C</p><p>In the musical example above, I dare say that the interval between bb and b is none other than 15:14.</p><p>&quot;Note that the nature of the diesis is best understood thru comparison with the chromatic semitone; much concerning the diesis will become clear as we demonstrate the nature of the chromatic semitone.&quot;</p><p>I think he means that the diesis will reveal itself when a chromatic semitone is sung.<br/>&quot;The Chromatic Semitone is that which includes 4 of the 5 dieses of the whole tone, and, as said earlier, it completes a whole tone when a diesis is added to it.&quot;</p><p>Here comes the confusing part. Remembering that the sizes of dieses are likely unequal, and that the chromatic semitone will demonstrate their nature, I believe that this must be the largest semitone at 27:25, rendering a very large fifth diesis with the ratio 25:24.</p><p>&quot;It results when some whole tone is divided in 2 so as to color some dissonance such as a 3rd, a 6th, or a 10th striving toward some consonance.&quot;</p><p>I understand from this statement that this interval serves as a leading-tone, by yielding 25:24 when a tone is subtracted from it!</p><p>&quot;The first part of a tone thus divisible will be larger if the melody ascends, and is called a chroma; the part that remains is a diesis, as here: [musical example]&quot;</p><p>c..c#.d | f..f#.g | G..G#.A</p><p>F..E..D | F..D..C | C..E..D</p><p>This perfectly gives us a chroma of 25:24 between c#-d, f#-g and G#-A!</p><p>&quot;from the diatonic and diesis arise the chromatic.&quot;</p><p>The fourth diesis is only 14 cents large and occuring between 15:14 and 27:25 in support of all the previous speculations.</p><p>&quot;2 of these 5 intervals [the dieses] joined together make up the enharmonic semitone, which is the smaller.&quot;</p><p>The diesis here is 35 cents and is the tritonic diesis at 50:49, which is half the chroma with the ratio 25:24. So the whole tone division of Marchetto becomes:</p><p>1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4 .. 5 .. 6 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9 --- Marchetto &quot;part&quot;<br/>1 ....... 2 ....... 3 ....... 4 ....... 5 --- Marchetto diesis<br/>50:49 ....25:24 ... 15:14 ... 27:25 ... 9:8 -- ratios of pitches<br/>35 ...... 70 ...... 119 ..... 133 ..... 204 -- tones in cents<br/>35 ...... 35 ...... 49 ...... 14 ...... 71 --- consecutive intervals in cents</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>On Aug 15, 2008, at 2:24 AM, monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Oz and Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert thomas martin&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just re-reading monz&apos; article on Marchetto on Padua:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To Oz and everyone else:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _Please_ refer to the newer versions of my webpages<br/>&gt; at the Tonalsoft website, and not to the old Sonic Arts<br/>&gt; pages!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/marchetto/marchetto.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/marchetto/marchetto.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The old Sonic Arts pages are mostly still lurking on<br/>&gt; the internet, and eventually i&apos;ll make all of them into<br/>&gt; redirection pages which point to the Tonalsoft pages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also realize that the old Sonic Arts pages have all<br/>&gt; of the internal links intact, and most of the links in<br/>&gt; the newer Tonalsoft pages are missing.

Will the speculation about this<br/>&gt; ever end? ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks to your post piquing my interest in Marchetto<br/>&gt; yet again, i&apos;ve done some more thinking about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still very much undecided as to exactly which<br/>&gt; mathematics may accurately describe what Marchetto<br/>&gt; wrote about in his theory ... and here is yet another<br/>&gt; possibility that i&apos;ve just thought of:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has always bothered me that Marchetto first divides<br/>&gt; the whole-tone into 9 parts, _then_ uses only the<br/>&gt; odd-numbered portions of that to achieve his 5-part<br/>&gt; division. What makes it really irksome is that he<br/>&gt; writes &quot;the first part is the first diesis&quot;, and then<br/>&gt; describes the other four dieses as &quot;from the first to<br/>&gt; the third&quot;, &quot;from the third to the fifth&quot;, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So in a flash of sudden insight, i realized that perhaps<br/>&gt; he was thinking of the integers the old-fashioned way,<br/>&gt; that is, _without zero as part of the set_!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If he started by counting the whole monochord string<br/>&gt; as the &quot;first part&quot; -- instead of the &quot;zeroeth part&quot;<br/>&gt; as we would do it today (and as i did in my webpage<br/>&gt; diagrams) -- then he could have a 9-part division<br/>&gt; of the whole-tone by labeling the divisions thus:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (use the &quot;Option&quot; and &quot;Use Fixed Width Font&quot; links if<br/>&gt; viewing this on the Yahoo website)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 72 . 71 . 70 . 69 . 68 . 67 . 66 . 65 . 64 -- arithmetic part<br/>&gt; 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4 .. 5 .. 6 .. 7 .. 8 .. 9 --- Marchetto &quot;part&quot;<br/>&gt; 1 ....... 2 ....... 3 ....... 4 ....... 5 --- Marchetto diesis<br/>&gt; 0 ....... 49 ...... 99 ...... 151 ..... 204 - ~cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is the proper interpretation, then all Marchetto<br/>&gt; was doing after all, was describing what are essentially<br/>&gt; quarter-tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No great argument from me yet in support of this<br/>&gt; interpretation -- it&apos;s just another of the many<br/>&gt; possibilities i and others have already thought up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To Robert:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; From Robert.

The etymology of &quot;apotome&quot; is &quot;offcut&quot;, i.e. a<br/>remainder. In the musical case it is usually the remainder when a<br/>limma is cut from a whole tone, which leaves what we now call a<br/>_chromatic_ semitone, not a diatonic one as Marchetto says. So I&apos;m<br/>willing to take apotome in its more general sense here and take it<br/>that he is just telling us that his diatonic semitone is larger than<br/>half a tone. Halving a tone in string-length terms means dividing the<br/>tone 18:17:16. So I take it that he&apos;s telling us his diatonic semitone<br/>is larger than 17:18 (99 cents), or maybe larger than 16:17 (105 cents).</p><p>Like almost every other commentator, I can only think he made a<br/>mistake (or bad approximation) in describing his enharmonic and<br/>diatonic semitones as 17:18 and 16:17 (and therefore as adding to make<br/>a whole tone). 16:17 and 17:18 semitones are so close together in size<br/>(6 cents difference) that there would be little point in giving them<br/>different names, and one could hardly expect singers to hear or sing<br/>them differently. And as I mentioned, they correspond to an _equal_<br/>2-fold division of the whole tone in string-length terms, and he<br/>apparently spent a lot of words telling is why he didn&apos;t want to<br/>divide the tone into 2 or 4 or 8 etc equal parts.</p><p>Apart from the 16:17:18 thing, does Marchetto clearly say that<br/>diatonic + enharmonic = whole tone? Or are we just inferring that from<br/>his saying that diatonic = 3 dieses, enharmonic = 2 dieses and tone =<br/>5 dieses, while forgetting that one of those dieses is much smaller<br/>than the others (really a comma).</p><p>To be heard and sung distinctly, and to be worthy of the names<br/>enharmonic, diatonic and chromatic, I feel they would need to differ<br/>by _at_least_ a syntonic comma (at least 20 cents). But I find it far<br/>more likely that they all differ by one of the larger of Marchetto&apos;s<br/>dieses.</p><p>So I really like two aspect of your interpretation:<br/>1. The fact that all three semitones can be demonstrated on the<br/>monochord with the same starting pitch, that of the open string.<br/>2. The fact that enharmonic, diatonic and chromatic semitones are in<br/>approximately their normal ranges in relation to the tetrachordal<br/>genera of the same name.</p><p>However it makes no sense to me that Marchetto would first derive an<br/>_unequal_ 9-fold division of the tone in order to derive an unequal<br/>5-fold division. He would just have gone directly to the unequal<br/>5-fold division. The only point in doing a 9-fold division first, is<br/>that the 9-fold division is _equal_ (in terms of string lengths).</p><p>I like Monz&apos;s original interpretation (shared by others): having<br/>monochord movable-bridge positions (more like fret positions in modern<br/>terms) at<br/>72 thru 80 1/81-ths of the open string length.</p><p>In modern terms, Marchetto actually divides the tone into one comma<br/>and four dieses. If we put the comma nearest the nut then with your<br/>arrangment we get:</p><p>Enharmonic semitone&#x9;65 cents&#x9;78:81 26:27<br/>Diatonic semitone&#x9;110 cents&#x9;76:81<br/>Chromatic semitone&#x9;156 cents&#x9;74:81<br/>Whole tone&#x9;&#x9;204 cents&#x9;72:81  9:8</p><p>............E.......D.......C.......W<br/>81  80  79  78  77  76  75  74  73  72<br/>| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |<br/>|-1-|       |---3---|       |---5---|<br/>    |---2---|       |---4---|</p><p>This preserves E D and C having sizes close to their traditional<br/>(ancient greek) sizes and makes them sufficiently different (45 cents<br/>different) to be worth distinguishing for singers. And preserves them<br/>being 2, 3 and 4 of Marchetto&apos;s &quot;dieses&quot;. But no two of these<br/>semitones add to give a whole tone.</p><p>Here are two online sources of Marchetto translations:<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/marchetto/marchetto.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/marchetto/marchetto.aspx</a><br/><a href="http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.98.4.6/mto.98.4.6.rahn.html">http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.98.4.6/mto.98.4.6.rahn.html</a></p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2008 11:04:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dave,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s what i find most intriguing about my latest<br/>&gt; &gt; interpretation of his theory, as meaning to represent<br/>&gt; &gt; ~quarter-tones.

But in what sense<br/>&gt; could we say &quot;the 5th part is 9&quot; since we&apos;ve just been<br/>&gt; told that the fifth part is 7 to 9?</p><p>Again, i think that if one assumes that Marchetto was<br/>beginning his counting with 1 rather than with 0, it<br/>starts to make more sense. I think perhaps he was counting<br/>the monochord divisions (i.e., his &quot;dieses&quot; and &quot;parts&quot;)<br/>according to the bridges which pinpoint pitches, rather<br/>than according to the actual intervals between the pitches<br/>as we would do today.</p><p>The Hindu-Arabic numeral system was really only first<br/>written about in Europe by Fibonacci in 1202, and its<br/>wide acceptance in Europe was mostly due to the spread<br/>of the printing press and printed books in the 1400s. See:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals</a></p><p>So at the time Marchetto wrote _Lucidarium_ it is quite<br/>likely that he would still have been starting his counting<br/>with 1 instead of 0. That&apos;s the only way i can make sense<br/>of his statement that &quot;the first part is the first diesis&quot;.</p><p>But yes, there certainly are some complications in the<br/>measurement of the various semitones according to numbers<br/>of dieses.</p><p>&gt; Regarding the semitone names: I guess if you&apos;re going to<br/>&gt; have 3 kinds of semitone and name them after the chromatic,<br/>&gt; diatonic and enharmonic tetrachord genera in which they<br/>&gt; occur, then the smallest has to be named &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>&gt; and the largest &quot;chromatic&quot;. But in the tetrachords,<br/>&gt; these would normally be something like 67, 90 and 114<br/>&gt; cents respectively, whereas Marchetto&apos;s would seem to be<br/>&gt; 99, 105 and something in the range 125 to 165 cents.</p><p>Now _that_ is a useful observation! I&apos;ll keep that in mind<br/>the next time i ponder Marchetto&apos;s semitones, and see if<br/>i can find some way to fit his descriptions to those numbers.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2008 3:03:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dave and Oz,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a good point about Marchetto calling the diatonic<br/>&gt; semitone the &quot;major apotome&quot;.

Confusingly enough, Marchetto calles the latter major apotome. If his natural diatonic scale is Pythagorean, as it seems to be, then the actual diatonic semitone is the limma. But Marchetto calls the &quot;larger remainder&quot; the diatonic semitone, which would produce the dileimma (pun intended) that we have 90 cents as well as 114 cents as the diatonic semitone. To solve the issue, we must conclude that the diatonic natural scale is not a Pythagorean major, but JI or close to JI, perhaps the Rast scale suggested by Safi al-din Urmavi who lived a century prior to Marchetto:</p><p>G 1<br/>A 9/8<br/>B 8192/6561<br/>C 4/3<br/>D 3/2<br/>E 27/16<br/>F 16/9<br/>G 2</p><p>In which case, the diatonic semitone becomes 2187:2048 and is the major remainder of the whole tone and the larger part of the tone divided into two (16:17:18 as you demonstrated). For this to be composed of three &quot;dieses&quot; that are not equalities, we need two quarter-tones and a comma, which arises if we divide the whole tone into 9 arithmetical parts (just as we divided it into two):</p><p>72/72&#x9;1/1&#x9;0 cents&#x9;&#x9;0<br/>73/72&#x9;&#x9;24 cents&#x9;1&#x9;1st part/diesis<br/>74/72&#x9;37/36&#x9;47 cents&#x9;2<br/>75/72&#x9;25/24&#x9;71 cents&#x9;3&#x9;2nd part/diesis<br/>76/72&#x9;19/18&#x9;94 cents&#x9;4<br/>77/72&#x9;&#x9;116 cents&#x9;5&#x9;3rd part/diesis<br/>78/72&#x9;13/12&#x9;139 cents&#x9;6<br/>79/72&#x9;&#x9;161 cents&#x9;7&#x9;4th part/diesis<br/>80/72&#x9;10/9&#x9;182 cents&#x9;8<br/>81/72&#x9;9/8&#x9;204 cents&#x9;9&#x9;5th part/diesis</p><p>Notice, that we have a comma of 24 cents as the first diesis, a quarter-tone of 47 cents as the second diesis and 46 cents as the third diesis. This solves the matter of the diatonic semitone.</p><p>What about the chromatic semitone then? Marchetto says that it is the chroma that completes to a whole tone with the addition of the diesis, is a diatonic semitone plus a diesis, and is composed of 4 of the 5 dieses mentioned. This could mean nothing other then 161 cents given above. Though I would have much preferred 13:12 as the chroma, but Marchetto seems to insist on taking only the primes within the number 9.</p><p>This leaves us with 25/24 as the enharmonic semitone, if we take a comma plus a quarter-tone, or 19/18 as the enharmonic semitone if we take two quarter-tones.

The etymology of &quot;apotome&quot; is &quot;offcut&quot;, i.e. a<br/>&gt; remainder. In the musical case it is usually the remainder when a<br/>&gt; limma is cut from a whole tone, which leaves what we now call a<br/>&gt; _chromatic_ semitone, not a diatonic one as Marchetto says. So I&apos;m<br/>&gt; willing to take apotome in its more general sense here and take it<br/>&gt; that he is just telling us that his diatonic semitone is larger than<br/>&gt; half a tone. Halving a tone in string-length terms means dividing the<br/>&gt; tone 18:17:16. So I take it that he&apos;s telling us his diatonic semitone<br/>&gt; is larger than 17:18 (99 cents), or maybe larger than 16:17 (105 &gt; cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like almost every other commentator, I can only think he made a<br/>&gt; mistake (or bad approximation) in describing his enharmonic and<br/>&gt; diatonic semitones as 17:18 and 16:17 (and therefore as adding to make<br/>&gt; a whole tone). 16:17 and 17:18 semitones are so close together in size<br/>&gt; (6 cents difference) that there would be little point in giving them<br/>&gt; different names, and one could hardly expect singers to hear or sing<br/>&gt; them differently. And as I mentioned, they correspond to an _equal_<br/>&gt; 2-fold division of the whole tone in string-length terms, and he<br/>&gt; apparently spent a lot of words telling is why he didn&apos;t want to<br/>&gt; divide the tone into 2 or 4 or 8 etc equal parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apart from the 16:17:18 thing, does Marchetto clearly say that<br/>&gt; diatonic + enharmonic = whole tone? Or are we just inferring that from<br/>&gt; his saying that diatonic = 3 dieses, enharmonic = 2 dieses and tone =<br/>&gt; 5 dieses, while forgetting that one of those dieses is much smaller<br/>&gt; than the others (really a comma).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To be heard and sung distinctly, and to be worthy of the names<br/>&gt; enharmonic, diatonic and chromatic, I feel they would need to differ<br/>&gt; by _at_least_ a syntonic comma (at least 20 cents). But I find it far<br/>&gt; more likely that they all differ by one of the larger of Marchetto&apos;s<br/>&gt; dieses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I really like two aspect of your interpretation:<br/>&gt; 1. The fact that all three semitones can be demonstrated on the<br/>&gt; monochord with the same starting pitch, that of the open string.<br/>&gt; 2. The fact that enharmonic, diatonic and chromatic semitones are in<br/>&gt; approximately their normal ranges in relation to the tetrachordal<br/>&gt; genera of the same name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However it makes no sense to me that Marchetto would first derive an<br/>&gt; _unequal_ 9-fold division of the tone in order to derive an unequal<br/>&gt; 5-fold division. He would just have gone directly to the unequal<br/>&gt; 5-fold division. The only point in doing a 9-fold division first, is<br/>&gt; that the 9-fold division is _equal_ (in terms of string lengths).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like Monz&apos;s original interpretation (shared by others): having<br/>&gt; monochord movable-bridge positions (more like fret positions in modern<br/>&gt; terms) at<br/>&gt; 72 thru 80 1/81-ths of the open string length.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In modern terms, Marchetto actually divides the tone into one comma<br/>&gt; and four dieses. If we put the comma nearest the nut then with your<br/>&gt; arrangment we get:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Enharmonic semitone&#x9;65 cents&#x9;78:81 26:27<br/>&gt; Diatonic semitone&#x9;110 cents&#x9;76:81<br/>&gt; Chromatic semitone&#x9;156 cents&#x9;74:81<br/>&gt; Whole tone&#x9;&#x9;204 cents&#x9;72:81  9:8&#x9;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ............E.......D.......C.......W<br/>&gt; 81  80  79  78  77  76  75  74  73  72<br/>&gt; | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |<br/>&gt; |-1-|       |---3---|       |---5---|<br/>&gt;    |---2---|       |---4---|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This preserves E D and C having sizes close to their traditional<br/>&gt; (ancient greek) sizes and makes them sufficiently different (45 cents<br/>&gt; different) to be worth distinguishing for singers. And preserves them<br/>&gt; being 2, 3 and 4 of Marchetto&apos;s &quot;dieses&quot;.

Also, if what I glean from your site is correct, the 17-tone scale you attribute to Beldemandis Prosdocimus is not originally his, but Abbasid music theorist Safi al-din Urmavi&apos;s (1216-1294). Please do not disregard the Islamic connection in Medieval European music theory. The fact that Prosdocimus replicated Urmavi&apos;s 17-tone Pythagorean scale in the 15th century lends credibility to my assumption that Marchetto might have known of Urmavi and made use of Rast as the natural diatonical scale, from which he found the diatonic semitone as the larger part of the whole tone divided in two.</p><p>Oz.</p><p>On Aug 18, 2008, at 1:03 AM, monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Dave and Oz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s a good point about Marchetto calling the diatonic<br/>&gt;&gt; semitone the &quot;major apotome&quot;.

The ancient<br/>&gt; Greek theory posited a gamut of pitches thus:<br/>&gt; A B C D E F G A Bb B C D E F G A<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason why it included a Bb is that the Lesser Perfect<br/>&gt; System incorporated the _tetrachord synemmenon_ (conjunct<br/>&gt; tetrachord) above the central note _mese_ (&quot;A&quot;), and<br/>&gt; this required a note a semitone above _mese_. The Greater<br/>&gt; Perfect System used the _tetrachord diezeugmenon_<br/>&gt; (disjunct tetrachord) and thus the two tetrachords above<br/>&gt; _mese_ exactly replicated the two below it, an octave<br/>&gt; higher. See my webpages:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/l/lps.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/l/lps.aspx</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/g/gps.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/g/gps.aspx</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/pis.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/pis.aspx</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This system was taken over by the medieval European theorists,<br/>&gt; and the Greek name _systema teleion ametabolon_ (&quot;Perfect<br/>&gt; Immutable System&quot; was apparently accepted entirely at<br/>&gt; face-value by the medieval theorists -- that is, from the<br/>&gt; earliest resurfacing of ancient Greek theory (in the<br/>&gt; _enchiriadis_ treatises, c. 900) all the way up to c.1300,<br/>&gt; theorists presented this set of pitches as _the_ set of<br/>&gt; musical pitch resources, without any question and without<br/>&gt; any options to include or consider any other pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As noted by Margo, in Europe, the early 1300s was a time<br/>&gt; of great experimentation in many aspects of music. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; typical for theorists of today to say that the addition<br/>&gt; of the other notes with flats, and also those with sharps,<br/>&gt; was an extension of the pythagorean system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I myself have explained the history this way. I.e.,<br/>&gt; since Bb-&gt;B represents 3^7 (in terms of the pythagorean<br/>&gt; lattice), and gives the primary example of _mutation_,<br/>&gt; and a mutation of F-&gt;F# also represents 3^7, a mutation<br/>&gt; of any nominal (A B C D E F G) to one with either a<br/>&gt; sharp or flat would always represent 3^7.

(Another, profound, connection is in the continuum of Ud and Lute, fretted and unfretted, monodic and polyphonic &ndash; and even a very important impetus to the development of keyboard music in the West &mdash;, with a geographical stretch so wide that drawing borders among them is an essentially meaningless exercise.)</p><p>In classical times, there were thriving cultivated musical traditions throughout the mediterranean and adjoining cultures, and the traces we have vividly suggest very deep connections and exchange as well as major differences among these cultures. The largest corpus of theory which survives classical times (at least in a known and accessible form -- the extent of music theory in the fertile crescent region being still a large unknown) is Greek and Hellenistic, and that scholarly corpus was maintained to a large extant in the huge area Byzantine music theory, before, during, and after the advent of Islam, while in the  much more limited Roman theoretical tradition, represented by Boethius, was in fact continuous in the west (so continuous, in fact, that Boethius&apos;s errors, in classical terms, are often &quot;correct&quot;, or at least more appropriate, in medieval European terms.)  It may be argued that both of these theoretical traditions were seriously circumscribed versions of Classical and Hellenistic theory, but I would argue instead that they simply became closely adapted to contemporary practice in the respective traditions. In any case, one must be cautious not to ignore these practical and theoretical traditions in preference for a neat line of transfer of cultural goods and practices.</p><p>These theoretical traditions contain, moreover, compelling evidence about other practices in the larger cultural region which did not either maintain or cultivate a theoretical practice of their own, for example in the missing chapter of Boethius, concerning the division of the fourth into two parts, one immediately thinks of the trichordal modes that remain the basis of classical music -- practiced by both Christians and Muslims -- in Ethiopia.  And when evidence is lacking, our curiosity is just as great: We know far too little about early musical practice in oriental Christendom, for example from the thriving musical culture of the Copts, whose musical tradition connects to both Ancient Egypt, the Hellenized world, the Upper Nile region and Aksum, and presumably to the Near East, with its own Jewish, Jewish-Christian, and early Christian diversity (and possibly others &mdash; Mandean, Samaritan, who knows?).</p><p>Likewise, the assimilation of classical and Hellenistic theory to practices throughout the Islamicate world has to be taken in stride, differentiating the science (or more precisely liberal art)of harmonics, with its culturally neutral techniques for measurement and comparison of intervals, and their composition into tones, n-chords, systems, and modes  from the description of the specific materials of real musical practice.  That practice, in the Islamicate world, includes &mdash; often assimilated, often isolated &mdash; continuity with its own huge range of additional cultures, radiating from Arabia to India, Persia, Central Asia, the Black Sea and the Caucasus, the Balkans, North Africa, and, yes, Byzantium.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2008 8:32:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It does not surprise me in the least that people with little faith in the Maker are just as easily influenced by fables and concocted stories as are members of religions for whose strenghtening of convictions the said myths are fabricated in the first place:</p><p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3517">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3517</a><br/><a href="http://www.bede.org.uk/library.htm#omar">http://www.bede.org.uk/library.htm#omar</a></p><p>If the collections of antiquity in Egypt were destroyed, where did Kindi and Farabi get their sources?

In this list, I try to bring forward the importance of the latter concerning music theory. It goes without saying that I am disturbed by accounts that are highlighted to cast aspersions on the humane contributions of Islamic civilization and religion to the world.

It is indeed a tragedy that the Asharite-Hanbalite-Salafi views have spread unhindered throughout the Muslim world following the downfall of the Mutazili school of thought which was a prime agent for learning and scientific progress.

The arithmetic division of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 9:8 whole-tone into 72:71:70:69:68:67:66:65:64 _does_<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in fact perfectly produce the 18:17:16 division.</p><p>I&apos;m more inclined to believe, as suggested by Margo, that 18:17:16 was<br/>given more as an example of what _not_ to do. That certainly agrees<br/>with Marchetto&apos;s preamble on the correctness of cutting things into 3<br/>parts rather than 2.</p><p>By the way, I can&apos;t help thinking that, when he speaks of &quot;the<br/>continuum&quot; he means &quot;the continuous octave&quot;, i.e. the musical (not<br/>mathematical) continuum with octave-equivalence assumed. So that when<br/>he says that dividing the continuum in two doesn&apos;t produce anything<br/>new, but dividing it in three does, it makes perfect sense. But then<br/>he uses a little sleight-of-mathematics to convince us that this<br/>should apply also to divisions of the tone.</p><p>&gt; Again, i think that if one assumes that Marchetto was<br/>&gt; beginning his counting with 1 rather than with 0, it<br/>&gt; starts to make more sense.</p><p>I don&apos;t know anyone who starts _counting_ with zero (except perhaps<br/>some computer programmers, but they&apos;re weird).</p><p>&gt; I think perhaps he was counting<br/>&gt; the monochord divisions (i.e., his &quot;dieses&quot; and &quot;parts&quot;)<br/>&gt; according to the bridges which pinpoint pitches, rather<br/>&gt; than according to the actual intervals between the pitches<br/>&gt; as we would do today.</p><p>I agree. But I don&apos;t believe he would count the nut.</p><p>We measure from zero, yes. But most of us still don&apos;t _count_ from<br/>zero. But one need not name the origin with a number for it to be an<br/>effective zero. We still speak of &quot;the nut&quot; rather than &quot;the zeroth fret&quot;.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s the only way i can make sense<br/>&gt; of his statement that &quot;the first part is the first diesis&quot;.</p><p>But he does not say that. His &quot;parts&quot; in that passage are _the_same_<br/>as what he later calls dieses, i.e. the 5 unequal &quot;parts&quot;, not the 9<br/>equally-spaced movable-bridge positions.</p><p>Allow me to refer to these equally-spaced movable-bridge positions as<br/>&quot;frets&quot;.</p><p>So I suggest that in effect he says: &quot;Fret 1 is the first diesis, fret<br/>1 to fret 3 is the second diesis, fret 3 to fret 5 is the third<br/>diesis, fret 5 to fret 7 is the fifth diesis, fret 7 to fret 9 is the<br/>5th diesis.&quot;</p><p>And I take that last part as just saying, &quot;notice that we use only<br/>(and all of) the odd numbered frets of the 9 frets&quot;.</p><p>He could have said &quot;The nut to fret 1 is the first diesis&quot;, but that<br/>seems unnecessary even to our ears today. That is the totally obvious<br/>interpretation of &quot;Fret 1 is the first diesis&quot;.</p><p>I think your diagram showing successive divisions of the string into 3<br/>equal parts and then those parts into 3 equal parts etc until we get 9<br/>equal parts within the 8:9 tone, is what Marchetto intended.</p><p>I think 16:17:18 is either a mistake or an example of what _not_ to do.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Regarding the semitone names: I guess if you&apos;re going to<br/>&gt; &gt; have 3 kinds of semitone and name them after the chromatic,<br/>&gt; &gt; diatonic and enharmonic tetrachord genera in which they<br/>&gt; &gt; occur, then the smallest has to be named &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; and the largest &quot;chromatic&quot;. But in the tetrachords,<br/>&gt; &gt; these would normally be something like 67, 90 and 114<br/>&gt; &gt; cents respectively, whereas Marchetto&apos;s would seem to be<br/>&gt; &gt; 99, 105 and something in the range 125 to 165 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now _that_ is a useful observation! I&apos;ll keep that in mind<br/>&gt; the next time i ponder Marchetto&apos;s semitones, and see if<br/>&gt; i can find some way to fit his descriptions to those numbers.</p><p>Given that one &quot;diesis&quot; is around 23 cents (+-1.5c) and the other four<br/>are around 45 cents (+-3c), and that enharmonic + diatonic =<br/>whole_tone, we have either:</p><p>[Use fixed width font]</p><p>enharmonic semitone ~= 23 + 45      =  68 c (+-3c)<br/>diatonic semitone   ~= 45 + 45 + 45 = 136 c (+-3c)</p><p>or</p><p>enharmonic semitone ~= 45 + 45      =  91 c (+-3c)<br/>diatonic semitone   ~= 45 + 45 + 23 = 113 c (+-4c)</p><p>Similarly for the chromatic semitone we have either:</p><p>chromatic semitone   ~= 23 + 45 + 45 + 45 = 159 c (+-3c)</p><p>or</p><p>chromatic semitone   ~= 45 + 45 + 45 + 45 = 181 c (+-2c)</p><p>I can&apos;t conceive of anyone calling something so close to a tone, any<br/>kind of semitone, so I figure the chromatic has to be around the 159<br/>cents.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any obvious way to decide betwen the two options for<br/>enharmonic and diatonic. 68c + 136c versus 91c + 113c. He calls the<br/>diatonic an &quot;apotome&quot; (offcut), but if he means _the_ (pythagorean)<br/>apotome (114c) then why didn&apos;t he call the enharmonic semitone the limma?</p><p>A 68 cent is more like what one would find in a tetrachord of the<br/>enharmonic genus. 90 cents is too large for that. But both 113 and 136<br/>cents may be found in diatonic genera.

Of course this only changes the results by a few cents,<br/>irrelevant to singers.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; O Dave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The size of the chromatic semitone (4 dieses) suggests a super-<br/>&gt; Pythagorean augmented prime (apotome), while the size of the diatonic<br/>&gt; semitone (3 dieses) suggests a 5-limit JI or meantone minor second.<br/>&gt; Confusingly enough, Marchetto calles the latter major apotome. If his<br/>&gt; natural diatonic scale is Pythagorean, as it seems to be, then the<br/>&gt; actual diatonic semitone is the limma. But Marchetto calls the &quot;larger<br/>&gt; remainder&quot; the diatonic semitone, which would produce the dileimma<br/>&gt; (pun intended) that we have 90 cents as well as 114 cents as the<br/>&gt; diatonic semitone. To solve the issue, we must conclude that the<br/>&gt; diatonic natural scale is not a Pythagorean major, but JI or close to<br/>&gt; JI, perhaps the Rast scale suggested by Safi al-din Urmavi who lived a<br/>&gt; century prior to Marchetto:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G 1<br/>&gt; A 9/8<br/>&gt; B 8192/6561<br/>&gt; C 4/3<br/>&gt; D 3/2<br/>&gt; E 27/16<br/>&gt; F 16/9<br/>&gt; G 2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In which case, the diatonic semitone becomes 2187:2048 and is the<br/>&gt; major remainder of the whole tone and the larger part of the tone<br/>&gt; divided into two (16:17:18 as you demonstrated). For this to be<br/>&gt; composed of three &quot;dieses&quot; that are not equalities, we need two<br/>&gt; quarter-tones and a comma, which arises if we divide the whole tone<br/>&gt; into 9 arithmetical parts (just as we divided it into two):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 72/72&#x9;1/1&#x9;0 cents&#x9;&#x9;0<br/>&gt; 73/72&#x9;&#x9;24 cents&#x9;1&#x9;1st part/diesis<br/>&gt; 74/72&#x9;37/36&#x9;47 cents&#x9;2<br/>&gt; 75/72&#x9;25/24&#x9;71 cents&#x9;3&#x9;2nd part/diesis<br/>&gt; 76/72&#x9;19/18&#x9;94 cents&#x9;4<br/>&gt; 77/72&#x9;&#x9;116 cents&#x9;5&#x9;3rd part/diesis<br/>&gt; 78/72&#x9;13/12&#x9;139 cents&#x9;6<br/>&gt; 79/72&#x9;&#x9;161 cents&#x9;7&#x9;4th part/diesis<br/>&gt; 80/72&#x9;10/9&#x9;182 cents&#x9;8<br/>&gt; 81/72&#x9;9/8&#x9;204 cents&#x9;9&#x9;5th part/diesis<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice, that we have a comma of 24 cents as the first diesis, a<br/>&gt; quarter-tone of 47 cents as the second diesis and 46 cents as the<br/>&gt; third diesis. This solves the matter of the diatonic semitone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about the chromatic semitone then? Marchetto says that it is the<br/>&gt; chroma that completes to a whole tone with the addition of the diesis,<br/>&gt; is a diatonic semitone plus a diesis, and is composed of 4 of the 5<br/>&gt; dieses mentioned. This could mean nothing other then 161 cents given<br/>&gt; above. Though I would have much preferred 13:12 as the chroma, but<br/>&gt; Marchetto seems to insist on taking only the primes within the number 9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This leaves us with 25/24 as the enharmonic semitone, if we take a<br/>&gt; comma plus a quarter-tone, or 19/18 as the enharmonic semitone if we<br/>&gt; take two quarter-tones. This interpretation favours 53-LEDO as a basis<br/>&gt; for &quot;Marchettan harmony&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2008 1:30:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think he was probably referring to the library at<br/>&gt; Alexandria<br/>&gt;</p><p>There was no Islam in the third century</p><p>Nor can the religion claim to have a monopoly on tuning development.<br/>or even a benevolent influence<br/>Many if not most of were Sufis which were regarded as outcast.

(Another, profound,<br/>&gt; connection is in the continuum of Ud and Lute, fretted and unfretted,<br/>&gt; monodic and polyphonic &ndash; and even a very important impetus to the<br/>&gt; development of keyboard music in the West &mdash;, with a geographical<br/>&gt; stretch<br/>&gt; so wide that drawing borders among them is an essentially meaningless<br/>&gt; exercise.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In classical times, there were thriving cultivated musical traditions<br/>&gt; throughout the mediterranean and adjoining cultures, and the traces we<br/>&gt; have vividly suggest very deep connections and exchange as well as<br/>&gt; major<br/>&gt; differences among these cultures. The largest corpus of theory which<br/>&gt; survives classical times (at least in a known and accessible form --<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; extent of music theory in the fertile crescent region being still a<br/>&gt; large<br/>&gt; unknown) is Greek and Hellenistic, and that scholarly corpus was<br/>&gt; maintained to a large extant in the huge area Byzantine music theory,<br/>&gt; before, during, and after the advent of Islam, while in the  much more<br/>&gt; limited Roman theoretical tradition, represented by Boethius, was in<br/>&gt; fact<br/>&gt; continuous in the west (so continuous, in fact, that Boethius&apos;s<br/>&gt; errors, in<br/>&gt; classical terms, are often &quot;correct&quot;, or at least more appropriate, in<br/>&gt; medieval European terms.)  It may be argued that both of these<br/>&gt; theoretical<br/>&gt; traditions were seriously circumscribed versions of Classical and<br/>&gt; Hellenistic theory, but I would argue instead that they simply became<br/>&gt; closely adapted to contemporary practice in the respective<br/>&gt; traditions. In<br/>&gt; any case, one must be cautious not to ignore these practical and<br/>&gt; theoretical traditions in preference for a neat line of transfer of<br/>&gt; cultural goods and practices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These theoretical traditions contain, moreover, compelling evidence<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt; other practices in the larger cultural region which did not either<br/>&gt; maintain or cultivate a theoretical practice of their own, for<br/>&gt; example in<br/>&gt; the missing chapter of Boethius, concerning the division of the fourth<br/>&gt; into two parts, one immediately thinks of the trichordal modes that<br/>&gt; remain<br/>&gt; the basis of classical music -- practiced by both Christians and<br/>&gt; Muslims<br/>&gt; -- in Ethiopia.  And when evidence is lacking, our curiosity is just<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; great: We know far too little about early musical practice in oriental<br/>&gt; Christendom, for example from the thriving musical culture of the<br/>&gt; Copts,<br/>&gt; whose musical tradition connects to both Ancient Egypt, the Hellenized<br/>&gt; world, the Upper Nile region and Aksum, and presumably to the Near<br/>&gt; East,<br/>&gt; with its own Jewish, Jewish-Christian, and early Christian diversity<br/>&gt; (and<br/>&gt; possibly others &mdash; Mandean, Samaritan, who knows?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Likewise, the assimilation of classical and Hellenistic theory to<br/>&gt; practices throughout the Islamicate world has to be taken in stride,<br/>&gt; differentiating the science (or more precisely liberal art)of<br/>&gt; harmonics,<br/>&gt; with its culturally neutral techniques for measurement and<br/>&gt; comparison of<br/>&gt; intervals, and their composition into tones, n-chords, systems, and<br/>&gt; modes<br/>&gt; from the description of the specific materials of real musical<br/>&gt; practice.<br/>&gt; That practice, in the Islamicate world, includes &mdash; often<br/>&gt; assimilated,<br/>&gt; often isolated &mdash; continuity with its own huge range of additional<br/>&gt; cultures, radiating from Arabia to India, Persia, Central Asia, the&gt; Black<br/>&gt; Sea and the Caucasus, the Balkans, North Africa, and, yes, Byzantium.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2008 12:31:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Do you care to prove the existence of Islam in the third century?<br/>and what is your problem with that.</p><p>--</p><p>     Posted by: &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot;  &lt;<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com/ozanyarman">http://profiles.yahoo.com/ozanyarman</a>&gt;</p><p>       Tue Aug 19, 2008 9:13 am (PDT)</p><p>These are just a load of empty claims without any references.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2008 12:35:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am not sure there is anything that can be labeled Islamic Theory any more than Christian Theory.

There was no Islamic culture/civilization the way we understand today prior to the 7th Century, although the religion&apos;s foundations precede Prophet Muhammed sallallahu aleyh&apos;s appearance by thousands of years.</p><p>2. Muslims (aside from a minority of fanatics found in every culture and period) have always preserved and furthered knowledge up until the rise of Asharite kelaam (Al-Ghazali was both an Ashari and a Sufi, and Nizam al-mulk, vezier to the Seljuki sultans and Sufi-lover, advocated the Nizamiyyah Madrassas based on Shafii jurisprudence that was packaged with Asharite views of the world). This meant that the medieval Islamic quest for science and knowledge came to a gradual halt by the 11th century onward, leading to the collapse of the three major Islamic empires by the 19th-20th Centuries.</p><p>3. Islamic or Islamicate corresponds to Christendom in the context of music theory, not Christianity. Surely, Boethius, Odo de Cluny, Guido de Arezzo, Marchetto da Padova and Philippe de Vitry were all Christendom theorists. Calling them and the Hellenes European does great injustice to the historical-cultural context. Who claims that Pythagoras, Archytas and Aristoxenus were European music theorists?
