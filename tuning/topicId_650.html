I like this effect, but I don&apos;t know of many<br/>examples outside of my own work.  The file...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/list/mystery.zip">http://lumma.org/list/mystery.zip</a> (48K)</p><p>...contains one of them.  To my ear, it seems to slow down at each repeat.<br/>I think this is because the change from 3 to 2 is sneeky, while the change<br/>from 2 back to 3 is abrupt.  How does it sound to you?</p><p>The first person to identify the origin of the tune wins a prize.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
