Too much of it sounds<br/> random and jangly.<br/> [Stearns:]<br/> I&apos;ve always thought that this was one of the most curious twists of<br/> fate in the whole contemporary tuning narrative; that Harry Partch --<br/> literately the voice of a tuning reform based squarely on aural<br/> causation -- would end up creating a music that the majority of folks<br/> of a similar (tuning reform based on aural causation, and some innate<br/> teleological righteousness) persuasion would probably find acutely<br/> unpalatable. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Since tuning is an issue that _can_ be considered without regard to a<br/>particular genre or repertoire, this list can have friendly and productive<br/>exchanges in spite of the fact that musical tastes may have precious little<br/>else in common.  I recall one list contributor for whom barbershop quartet<br/>music was most sublime musical expression, others come from the early music<br/>world, or music ethnology, or from some vernacular contemporary music.  Many<br/>on the list find music from the experimental tradition within which I grew up<br/>to be anything but music in the first place.</p><p>After twenty years of working with his scores and 25 years of listening to<br/>recordings (the first was the quadraphonic &quot;World of Harry Partch&quot;, bought<br/>with paper route money after seeing the public TV documentary), I find Partch<br/>to have been an amazing yet extremely uneven and contradictory composer.  His<br/>music does not sit well in any of the established genres.  His microtonal<br/>melodic recitation of lyric poetry exists somewhere between an edwardian<br/>parlor entertainment and balkan epic singing, yet is really close to neither.<br/>The impulse for his harmonic language was a thick (hexadic) harmonic texture<br/>that belongs to the earliest part of the century*. He thought of himself as a<br/>man of the theatre and a contemporary of composers like Douglas Moore or Otto<br/>Leuning.  The experimentalists, who were, in principle, the most supportive,<br/>were rejected outright by Partch, until Lou Harrison&apos;s late conversion to<br/>Just Intonation.  Tuning theory was a central concern for Partch through the<br/>writing of the first edition of his book, and then became a side concern to<br/>actual composition where his use of tonal materials was often quite free.<br/>The resources of the diamond were basically exhausted for Partch with _Dark<br/>Brother_, _Ring Around the Moon_, and the _Intrusions_.  His earliest work is<br/>summed up in _Oedipus_ where recitation is at its most developed and the<br/>choruses use ostinati based on the &quot;tonal flux&quot; progressions found at extreme<br/>distances on the diamond. With _Castor &amp; Pollux_, the emphasis was now on<br/>rhythm and percussion -- especially superimposed ostinati in compund metres<br/>-- and the pitches chosen were described by Partch himself as &quot;atonal&quot;.<br/>&quot;Random and jangly&quot; wrote Rosati; that&apos;s exactly where Partch had gone. The<br/>large stage productions which followed fell often into intended as well as<br/>unconcious self parody, and a balance between Partch&apos;s tonal and atonal<br/>practices is not really to be found until _Petals_ where sublime stands<br/>unashamededly next to the ridiculous while suburban domesticity mingles with<br/>the exotic. (If anyone wants to go into any detail about Partch&apos;s tonal<br/>practice, we might do this in another thread...).</p><p>If Partch has a place into any of our canons, it will not be because of any<br/>normative standards of quality or virtue, but rather because of his<br/>exceptionality. Machaut, Ockeghem, Josquin, Monteverdi, Bach, Mozart,<br/>Beethoven, Wagner, Ives, Sibelius, Schoenberg, Partch, Cage... works by all<br/>those dead white guys have survived and will thrive because they are<br/>exceptional.  Sometimes someone will be rediscovered -- Hans Rott is the best<br/>recent example -- and the whole deck will have to be reshuffled (i.e. with<br/>Rott in, what happens to early Mahler?).</p><p>_____<br/>* It&apos;s still amazing to think that Partch, after the apparent failure of the<br/>intial tuning for the Kithara with its complete representation of the<br/>diamond, still contemplated an extension of the diamond through the<br/>identities 13, 15, and 17.</p></div>
