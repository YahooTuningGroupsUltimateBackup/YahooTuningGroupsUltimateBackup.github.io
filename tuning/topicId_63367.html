Dover do a cheap reprint of F.T. Arnold&apos;s early 20th<br/>century book which includes a comprehensive list of sources and many<br/>extracts. Of course it depended on the taste &amp; judgment of the<br/>players, but there were many fairly solid rules. Debate about<br/>6th-chords, inversions etc. is a sidetrack, in practice the notes to<br/>be played do not depend on it.</p><p>As to *why*, it comes from a point in musical history when the<br/>harmonically self-sufficient contrapuntal textures of the Renaissance<br/>were abandoned in favour of one or more melodic lines above one or<br/>more instruments playing a bass line. These alone typically would not<br/>create a complete or full harmony. The keyboard (or lute/theorbo/etc.)<br/>player would play chords more or less in the middle of the texture<br/>completing the musical picture. The &apos;figures&apos; apply to each bass note<br/>and indicate the pitch classes that the composer would expect, or<br/>equivalently the harmonic progression, since the chords were not<br/>written out explicitly. Even when the written-out lines do constitute<br/>a complete harmony, the &apos;continuo&apos; contributes to the texture and rhythm.</p><p>There are lots of conventions, for example if there are no figures<br/>then the root position chord on the bass with the given key signature<br/>is to be played. It&apos;s not all so logical - for example &apos;2&apos; means the<br/>6th and 4th and 2nd (or octave transpositions thereof) while &apos;9&apos; means<br/>the 9th and 5th and 3rd.</p><p>Sometimes there are *unfigured* basses where the player can make up<br/>the harmony ad hoc (hopefully in view of the melody lines) - there are<br/>many rules for this too, for example when the bass rises a semitone<br/>one takes the 6 and 3 on the first note and 5 and 3 on the second.</p><p>Many of the textbook rules of figured bass are in fact virtually<br/>identical to so-called &apos;four part harmony&apos;.</p><p>Once we have worked out what harmony appears at which point and how to<br/>avoid possible four-part faux-pas, it is more or less open season on<br/>voicing, dynamics, chordal figuration, etc. as long as one respects<br/>the actual melodic parts. If there is no melody part at all then we<br/>reach the situation mentioned by Neil, of improvisation above a<br/>figured bass, or even above a non-figured one, which may be repeated<br/>and become a set of variations or &apos;chaconne&apos; or &apos;passacaglia&apos;.</p><p>However, in the case of one or more melody lines above a bass, I would<br/>say the main function would be chordal accompaniment rather than<br/>melodic improvisation.  Bach was, exceptionally, known for improvising<br/>new melodic lines when playing continuo in other people&apos;s compositions.<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div>
