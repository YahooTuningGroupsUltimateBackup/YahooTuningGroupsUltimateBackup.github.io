It&apos;s very modern, involving a lot of talk<br/>about healing, frequencies, Armageddon, atomic clocks, and such. One of<br/>the main characters is a guitarist, who rides the subways; he&apos;s starting<br/>to hear/play a music that is strange to him, and he gradually starts<br/>playing microtonally to achieve what&apos;s in his head. I am going to be<br/>using my 31 tone electric a lot, with a bit of fretless, too...Starrett<br/>is building the prop guitars, and we may also be doing some recording as<br/>well. There is some dialogue involving tunings/frequencies, and it&apos;s<br/>done pretty well, I feel. This character and his music are an intregal<br/>part of the play. Starrett and I were wondering if this is the first<br/>play that involves microtones...anybody know of anything?<br/>    It&apos;s being done at the Denver Center for Performing Arts, which is<br/>probably one of the best regional theaters in the country..they won a<br/>Tony in 1998, and 2 of their plays made Time mag&apos;s top 10 list for 2000.<br/>It&apos;s a good outfit, and they do high quality work. If anyone is<br/>interested, their # is 303-893-4000. It starts April 5, and runs through<br/>May 19...maybe we&apos;ll see some of you there...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=19845 href="#19845">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2001 5:01:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I wanted to mention an interesting project I am involved with for the<br/>&gt; next couple of months..it&apos;s a play, &quot;Inna Beginning,&quot; and is a world<br/>&gt; premier; a couple of Denver guys put it together, and brought in a NY<br/>&gt; scriptwriter to help out.
