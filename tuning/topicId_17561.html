This<br/>happens to coincide with the increased number of tonic keys and greater<br/>range of harmonic variety found in his music around that time (in contrast,<br/>Mozart&apos;s music shows no increase in key range; he remained within the<br/>meantone range*).  The conjecture that Haydn started to use a temperament<br/>allowing 24 keys is reasonable.  The question is: to what extent did he hear<br/>this temperament as making intonational distinctions among the keys?   Did<br/>he hear the temperament as, for all intents and purposes, a practical<br/>implementation of equal temperament? Or, did he compose intending to project<br/>intervallic distinctions among the keys?</p><p>Beethoven knew Kirnberger&apos;s writings well (pirated editions were available<br/>in Vienna!); the range of keys allowed by the third Kirnberger tuning would<br/>reasonably fit Beethoven&apos;s music.  Kelletat, on the basis of writings by<br/>T&iuml;&iquest;&half;rk, Daubes. Sulzer, Preindl and Seyfried, concludes that it was indeed<br/>&quot;the contemporary tuning of the Viennese classicists&quot;.  Again, the questions<br/>I raise above concerning Haydn should be asked, the writings of the time are<br/>simply not clear about this question.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest</p><p>*e.g. G minor, the best meantone minor key, was Mozart&apos;s favorite. There is<br/>some slight evidence, however, in his use of f minor (in KV280 and KV519)<br/>that he might have used the Kirnbergian contrast between the pythagorean<br/>minor tonic and subdominant with a nearly-just dominant.</p><p>&gt; My thoughts were more that he was thinking in the concrete 1/6 comma<br/>&gt; meantone system or Werckmeister system that Ed Foote was talking<br/>&gt; about.  That, is, provided he could still HEAR the system which,<br/>&gt; apparently he could... in the period we were discussing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After that time, most probably, he wrote with these same sounds in<br/>&gt; mind... Werckmeister or whatever, that he had internalized.  Of<br/>&gt; course THAT part is totally speculative...<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; _________ _______ _____ _<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=17586 href="#17586">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2001 7:43:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17561">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17561</a></p><p>&gt; With regard to the tuning practices of classic-era Vienna, the<br/>relevant theorist is Kirnberger, not Werckmeister.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 1780&apos;s, Haydn became aware of the writings of Kirnberger.<br/>This happens to coincide with the increased number of tonic keys and<br/>greater range of harmonic variety found in his music around that time<br/>(in contrast, Mozart&apos;s music shows no increase in key range; he<br/>remained within the meantone range*).</p><p>Thank you, Daniel Wolf, for your clarification of this.
