Especially in middle<br/>range, one can invent many alt. fingerings and add a few fingers<br/>here and there or shade notes. Recorder is especially good for that<br/>as the alternate fingerings often have as good a quality of sound<br/>as the standard ones (which I gather isn&apos;t the case for, say,<br/>the baroque flute).</p><p>I&apos;ll be interested to find out more about what&apos;s been done and<br/>is being done with microtonal recorders.</p><p>However, I find it is possible to vary the volume at a steady pitch,<br/>or pitch at a steady volume, by just changing the way I breath into<br/>it. Sort of focussed, and a bit bouncing off the top of the<br/>passage.</p><p>I know that the air passage is long before it hits the edge, but it<br/>seems there is just enough leeway there to bend it a bit.</p><p>Like, an echo effect from f to mf, nothing as dramatic as say<br/>f to p, but still enough to make quite a variation dynamics,<br/>especially when coupled with varying attack on the notes.</p><p>Because the recorder is so sensitive to pitch, it also varies the<br/>pitch by a fair amount, seems to be about a third of a semitone in fact,<br/>at the same volume - but that may easily be an over estimate, as<br/>it is a bit hard to tell if two notes are really exactly<br/>the same volume, esp. with recorder when increasing air pressure<br/>just a bit varies the pitch so much more than the volume.</p><p>One idea, maybe what it is is that I add turbulence to the air<br/>stream by blowing in that way, in fact feels a bit like that.<br/>Then the turbulence could survive through the air stream, in fact,<br/>I&apos;m sure it would, and presumably all the little vortexes hitting<br/>the sharp edge could cause a different pitch from a very gentle<br/>steady air stream.</p><p>It&apos;s not like a vibrato, the air pressure stays constant, but<br/>you make it more turbulent.</p><p>One could do a crescendo or decrescendo in that way, but would<br/>be quite hard, I&apos;m not up to that yet. But it is fairly easy<br/>to do an echo effect f, then mf, using identical fingerings<br/>for both, and identical pitch.</p><p>There is a slight change in the quality of the sound as well<br/>when one does it, but it isn&apos;t great.</p><p>The note when it is more turbulent is the one that is sharp<br/>(and so that&apos;s the way one plays for the echo)<br/>- don&apos;t know if that fits in with theory or not?</p><p>I suppose I could be fooling myself- it is rather easy to do<br/>that with this kind of thing (e.g. varying attack, or hovering<br/>fingers shading the holes, or whatever), and it is a fairly<br/>subtle effect, more than the third of a semitone pitch change<br/>might suggest because of the extreme sensitivity of the<br/>recorder pitch to volume.</p><p>However, tried several times and listened carefully, and still<br/>seem to be able to do it!</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to hear if anyone else is able to duplicate<br/>this.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=21126 href="#21126">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2001 5:29:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, recorder enthusiasts again:</p><p>There&apos;s no doubt about it now, - after a rest and<br/>trying again, I&apos;m getting a dynamic range of<br/>f to pp for the same note on the recorder.</p><p>Playing the g in the low register of the descant,<br/>so it can&apos;t be because of varying the amount<br/>by which the note is pinched, and the other<br/>fingers are well out of the way, indeed, one can<br/>play it with only one hand on the recorder, so can&apos;t be<br/>shading by them.</p><p>In the middle register, you also have to vary the<br/>amount you pinch by to play the quiet notes.<br/>- i.e. add turbulence, and make the gap smaller to get a<br/>quieter note at the same pitch - because you need<br/>less breath pressure so need to pinch more to prevent<br/>the note from breaking (for pinching, actually, I use<br/>the ball of the thumb rather than the nail, and just<br/>leave a gap, which is just as accurate once one gets<br/>used to it, and possibly faster for changes of<br/>register).</p><p>Also, I&apos;m not sure, but it may also be<br/>a bit more liable to break in the middle register than it would be<br/>normally, when you do this.</p><p>In the middle register, for many notes it is more like<br/>mf to p, but very variable.</p><p>In the high register, the note is definitely more liable<br/>to break when you add turbulence. However, you can also use the amount<br/>of turbulence to help to choose one of the pitches for the<br/>high fingerings that play a variety of pitches depending on breath<br/>pressure.</p><p>e,g<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half; - 2</p><p>which plays a high E7 (rather flat, so needs to be made sharp if poss,<br/>e,g, by _very_ _slightly_ leaking a bit of air from the 1, but perfectly<br/>serviceable), or a G7 (very nicely in tune and about as easy to play as<br/>the more usual &iuml;&iquest;&half; 1 - - 4 fingering for this note), or an A7, or an F7 sharp,<br/>or an F8 sharp in a hurricane, rather nice to my ears, with a bit of<br/>F8 sharp colouring amongst a lot of white noise from the breath.<br/>(all these are somewhat dependent on the particular recorder used).</p><p>One can really get lots of interesting effects now in the high<br/>register with varying turbulence! Things like playing a note<br/>with white noise, and a quiet varying pitch glissando in another<br/>pitch below it.</p><p>Also for some of those notes, you can vary the pitch a lot<br/>by varying the turbulence, which is very useful indeed!</p><p>I haven&apos;t yet reached the point where I can use the<br/>high register notes routinely in melodies, though can use<br/>some of them for occasional one off notes. But with<br/>this turbulence thing, they get quite a bit easier,<br/>so may be able to eventually!</p><p>I&apos;ve been doing some practicing of pieces with this,<br/>and it really is quite a breakthrough in terms of<br/>extra dynamics, and ease of playing!</p><p>My best guess is still that it works by adding<br/>turbulence to the air stream. Pretty easy to do<br/>once you get the idea of it.</p><p>I&apos;ll do a recording of it some time and post it (can&apos;t<br/>seem to find my microphone right now).</p><p>Much easier than shading and alternate<br/>fingering, which I&apos;ve never quite got the hang<br/>of somehow for anything except very slow passages.</p><p>However, would be nice to work out a fingering scheme<br/>for some scales, say, for the 1 3 5 7, 1 3 5 11<br/>and 1 3 7 11 hexanies for example, as I&apos;m planning<br/>on working on those for a while.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=21129 href="#21129">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
