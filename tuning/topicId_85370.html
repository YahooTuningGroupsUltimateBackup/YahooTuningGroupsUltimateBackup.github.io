IT IS A GOOD SIGN OF HARMONY TO SEE FOUR IDENTICAL GRAPHS FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRIADS. BESIDES, THEY SHOW ORDAINED AND PERIODIC DATA ALONG 4 SECONDS.</p><p>The following response shape correspond to C maj, C# maj, Eb maj,<br/>E maj, F# maj, G maj, A maj, Bb maj; it is made of periodic and ordained chord wave peaks.</p><p>SORRY, A SECOND INTERESTING GRAPH THAT WAS PLACED HERE WAS ALSO DELETED. IT IS A PERIODIC AND ORDAINED INFORMATION ALONG 4 SECONDS. THE 8 MAJOR TRIADS MENTIONED ABOVE SHOW THE SAME KIND OF RESPONSE SO IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT JUSTHARM SCALE IS BETTER THAN PIAGUI SCALE.</p><p>I THINK THAT I CANNOT SEND DIAGRAMS.</p><p>Thank you<br/>Mario Pizarro<br/>Lima, December 09<br/>piagui@...</p></div>
