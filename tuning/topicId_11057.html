I hope you have other instances that<br/>&gt;can warm the cockles of your heart, Allen!  :)</p><p> If the NewBand program notes were correct,  part of the performance that<br/>evening was recorded &quot;during&quot; the performance and &quot;played back double speed&quot; a<br/>bit later-</p><p>I was too busy listening to and watching the players to pay much attention to<br/>the technology so I may be wrong- but my concert companions of that evening<br/>agree with me.</p><p>Now it&apos;s probably a matter of semantics but live recording/playback is &quot;live<br/>electronic music&quot; (at least in my histories)- absolutely no different that<br/>real-time sample/playback which many of have done for years.  And speed/pitch<br/>alteration is signal processing is my book. In fact, I think the NewBand<br/>performance this questionable evening was done with an ADAP which makes it<br/>&quot;Digital&quot; signal processing. If Harry, purposely or not, contributed in some<br/>way to the history of technical musical applications, then more power to him.</p><p>My cockles have hence been warmed- if anyone wants to continue this discussion<br/>let&apos;s do it privately - I think it makes interesting historical debate but has<br/>little to do with tuning.</p><p>Cheers-</p><p>Allen</p><p>Allen<br/>--<br/>=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+<br/>                         Allen Strange<br/>        Electro-Acoustic Music Coordinator<br/>                    Graduate Coordinator<br/>                 San Jose State University<br/>                    1 Washington Square<br/>                San Jose, CA 95192-0095<br/>   Vox + 408-924-4646 Fax + 408 924-4773<br/>                Home fax + 408 399-3061<br/>=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+=+*+</p></div>
