(Check me if I&apos;m wrong,<br/>Joe.) At least, this is what I heard, if not what I said. In both cases, the<br/>triangle wave made the third move _less_ than the sine wave did when the<br/>fifth came in--therefore both triangle examples were flatter than than in<br/>the sine wave examples. And Paul is correct in that I said I heard the third<br/>rise more vividly in the sine examples.</p><p>Isn&apos;t it nice when everyone can be right?  :-))))))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Could there be some mathematical explanation in a kind of Fourier analysis<br/>&gt;&gt;approach that could explain why the different timbres could result in a<br/>&gt;&gt;different &quot;perception&quot; of these thirds... or doesn&apos;t that &quot;wash...??&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not Fourier analysis, but psychoacoustics: sine-wave components do tend to<br/>&gt; _subjectively_ &quot;push&quot; one another apart -- that&apos;s what those German papers<br/>&gt; were about . . .</p><p>Paul, does &quot;push one another apart&quot; mean &quot;widen the interval&quot;?</p><p>Joe, I&apos;m pleased to know you heard something similar to what I experienced.<br/>Your post, like Graham&apos;s, may inspire others here on the List to get into<br/>&quot;ear&quot; tuning. That would be the best of all worlds, from my standpoint, and<br/>would validate my journey into the land of the microtonalists.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
