So that maps 4:5:6 to 12:21:28,<br/>right? Do you know of any ways to map arbitrary triads to other<br/>triads, such as mapping 4:5:6 to 7:9:11 somehow? You can map 4:5:6 to<br/>5:6:8 by turning a meantone 3/2 generator into a mavila 4/3 generator,<br/>and melodies end up being upside down as a result too.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
