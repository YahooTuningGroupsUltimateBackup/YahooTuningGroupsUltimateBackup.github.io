His &gt; main claim though is that using a C=256Hz reference puts the register &gt; breaks of &quot;the human voice&quot; in the correct places for bel canto singing &gt; (accented notes/words where each register is strongest).  That as if &gt; biology could place register breaks in a human voice to such high &gt; precision across all humans, and as if bel canto singing is the only &gt; style of singing that matters.<br/>&gt; &gt; It all sounds like your basic load&apos;o&apos;crap to me, but perhaps it&apos;s worth &gt; pointing out that if you tout C=256 tuning, you may find a bunch of &gt; LaRouchies agreeing with you.</p></div><h3><a id=56952 href="#56952">ðŸ”—</a>Pete McRae &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2005 8:17:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t recommend any tuning pitch standard for anyone, actually.
