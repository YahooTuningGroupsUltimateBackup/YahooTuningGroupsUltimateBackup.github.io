He<br/>didn&apos;t give any specific examples, but I&apos;ll bet he could back it up<br/>if asked.  So, if there are any questions regarding the extent of the<br/>use of the Sims/Maneri glyphs, we should take the following Mook<br/>comments into consideration:</p><p>&quot;By adding only three symbols and using them alone or in combination<br/>with the traditional ones, these 1/12 -tone symbols contained in<br/>MICRO cause the least possible disruption of the players&apos; perceptual<br/>habits. The ease with which they can be learned and applied has been<br/>thoroughly tested in over 20 years of performances by ensembles and<br/>soloists in the US, Europe and Japan.&quot;</p><p>JP</p></div>
