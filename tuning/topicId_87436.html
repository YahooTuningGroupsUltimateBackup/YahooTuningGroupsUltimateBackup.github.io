I believe the pieces<br/>broadened the audience&apos;s horizons. I commented with a famous saying of<br/>mine in the end: &quot;There are no unacceptable intervals in music, there<br/>are, at worst, unacceptable applications of such.&quot;</p><p>Although there were attempts to politicize the event by drawing<br/>irrelevant parallels to Afghanistan and the Ergenekon terrorism case<br/>(for ITU is famous for its leftist stance), I did not permit politics<br/>to interfere with the aesthetics of music-making.</p><p>This was the first time, I think, such a &quot;foreign&quot; microtonal package<br/>was presented in Istanbul. Most people liked what they heard, as have I.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Dr. Ozan Yarman</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 7:55:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; Dr. Ozan Yarman</p><p>Congratulations, Dr. Yarman.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 9:22:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Gene!</p><p>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Apr 15, 2010, at 5:55 PM, genewardsmith wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Dr. Ozan Yarman<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Congratulations, Dr. Yarman.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 9:31:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oz, next time find someone with a video camera!!</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Thu, Apr 15, 2010 at 10:55 AM, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...<br/>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Ozan Yarman<br/>&gt; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; &gt; Dr. Ozan Yarman<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Congratulations, Dr. Yarman.<br/>&gt;</p></div>
