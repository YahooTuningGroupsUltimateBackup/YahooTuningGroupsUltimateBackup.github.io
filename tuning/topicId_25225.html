It took McLaren versions for many to appreciate Darreg&apos;s<br/>work.<br/>&gt; &gt; For me there is still something in the original that stands on it&apos;s own<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; this is very true of Partch where the weaknesses just adds to the human<br/>&gt; &gt; quality of his music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;      Some of you may wonder what Kraig is talking about here.<br/>&gt;      Ivor Darreg is one of the most important microtonal composers<br/>&gt; and instrument-builders in post-war America.  Starting in 1935,<br/>&gt; Ivor built his own electronic instruments and retuned them into<br/>&gt; various just intonation and equal tempered tunings. For 59 years,<br/>&gt; until his death in 1994, Ivor composed in and wrote about a wide<br/>&gt; variety of different equal tempered and just intonation systems,<br/>&gt; including 10 equal, 13 equal, 14 equal, 15 equal, 16 equal, 17 equal,<br/>&gt; 18 equal, 19 equal, 22 equal, 24 equal, 31 equal and 53 equal.<br/>&gt; Ivor&apos;s &quot;Xenharmonic Bulletins&quot; were bound as part of John Chalmers&apos;<br/>&gt; journal &quot;Xenharmonikon,&quot; and Ivor produced 12 Xenharmonic Bulletins<br/>&gt; including a &quot;Special Bulletin&quot; which qualifies as &quot;Xenharmonic<br/>&gt; Bulletin Number Zero.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Ivor did not have access to modern digital retunable synthesizers<br/>&gt; until<br/>&gt; I loaned him one. In 1991 I dragged over a VFX synthesizer and an 8088 DOS<br/>&gt; laptop with a serial MIDI interface to Ivor Darreg&apos;s house.  The laptop<br/>&gt; recorded MIDI files of pieces which Ivor improvised in every equal<br/>&gt; temperament from 9 through 31.<br/>&gt;      Two subsequent sessions recorded MIDI files of Ivor&apos;s improvs<br/>&gt; in every equal temperament up to 53 equal.<br/>&gt;      At home, I recorded Ivor&apos;s MIDI pieces using the synthesizer<br/>&gt; Ivor had used to record his pieces. In the process I edited out<br/>&gt; a very small number of slight errors Ivor made while playing --<br/>&gt; accidential strikes of 2 keys at once, etc.<br/>&gt;       From these 3 MIDI recordings 3 audio CDs of Ivor&apos;s<br/>&gt; music were produced.<br/>&gt;       Ivor named these 3 CDs &quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier - Volume<br/>&gt; 1,&quot; Volume 2, and Volume 3.<br/>&gt;       The music on these 3 CDs is typical of Ivor&apos;s microtonal<br/>&gt; compositional style and many people have called these CDs &quot;wonderful&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;impressive.&quot;  However, while the music on the CDs remains<br/>&gt; typical of Ivor, the timbres sound much cleaner and more digital<br/>&gt; than the earlier reel-to-reel recordings Ivor made of his music<br/>&gt; from 1957 until his death.<br/>&gt;      The synthesizers Ivor built by hand to explore various<br/>&gt; microtonal tunings used analog tubes and analog oscillators.<br/>&gt; As a result, Ivor&apos;s other recordings (aside from the 3 CDs<br/>&gt; &quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier&quot; Volumes 1, 2 and 3) have<br/>&gt; a characteristic crackly slightly noisy analog &quot;sound.&quot;<br/>&gt;      This is why Kraig Grady mentioned &quot;It took McLaren versions for<br/>&gt; many to appreciate Darreg&apos;s work.&quot;  The digital timbres used<br/>&gt; in the 3 CDs &quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier&quot; have the sleek<br/>&gt; noiseless somewhat metallic quality typical of all digital<br/>&gt; synthesizers, and some people appear to judge CDs solely by<br/>&gt; the amount of background hiss, rather than the quality of<br/>&gt; the music.<br/>&gt;       However, Kraig Grady is entirely correct when he points out<br/>&gt; that &quot;for me there is still something in the original that<br/>&gt; stands on its own.&quot;  In the case of Ivor&apos;s reel-to-reel recordings<br/>&gt; made using his hand-built amplified acoustic and analog electronic<br/>&gt; microtonal instruments, each note of Ivor&apos;s electronic instruments<br/>&gt; has its own slightly different timbre. Moreover, on instruments<br/>&gt; like his amplifying clavichord Ivor uses techniques which are<br/>&gt; impossible even on modern digital synthesizers -- for example,<br/>&gt; tremolo on a single note.<br/>&gt;     For those of you interested in Ivor Darreg&apos;s original recordings,<br/>&gt; I have also released a CD compiled from Ivor&apos;s original reel<br/>&gt; recordings. These recordings go back to 1957 and are of surprisingly<br/>&gt; high audio quality. These recordings show the classic analog<br/>&gt; &quot;sound&quot; of Ivor&apos;s microtonal music, with music Ivor recorded<br/>&gt; in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s.<br/>&gt;     For a taste of the newer digital &quot;sound&quot; of Ivor&apos;s microtonal<br/>&gt; music on digital synthesizers (dating from about 1988 to 1994),<br/>&gt; try Ivor&apos;s CDs &quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier&quot; Volumes 1, 2 and<br/>&gt; 3.<br/>&gt;     All these CDs of Ivor Darreg&apos;s music are available from<br/>&gt; The Microtonal Record Shelf, which is currently running a<br/>&gt; &quot;buy 3, get 1 free&quot; promotion right now. Each CD is normally<br/>&gt; $15.00 but for members of this group I will give a discount to<br/>&gt; $12.00 each.  E-mail me for info on how to order these CDs by<br/>&gt; Ivor Darreg.<br/>&gt;     The Microtonal Record Shelf currently has 41 audio CDs of<br/>&gt; microtonal music in its catalog, along with 2 books and 3<br/>&gt; instructional audio CDs: the single CD &quot;Introduction to<br/>&gt; Microtonality,&quot; and the 2-CD set &quot;Consonance and Dissonance<br/>&gt; in  Microtonality.&quot;<br/>&gt;     E-mail me if you&apos;re interested in getting a catalog and a<br/>&gt; 60-minute sampler CD containing audio excepts from all 41 of<br/>&gt; our microtonal CDs.<br/>&gt;     -- mclaren<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br/>*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
