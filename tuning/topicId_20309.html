There&apos;s a 12tET major<br/>third at 399.9 cents. And the other intervals are all kind<br/>of out there. See, that&apos;s where the fun begins. This<br/>tuning has a lot of interesting beat patterns in it. Try<br/>it. It is fun. It is a good tuning. I like this tuning.<br/>No, I am not playing a joke. I really do see this as a<br/>nonoctave tuning and a good one at that.
