Isn&apos;t this earlier<br/>than Owen Jorgensen accepts?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>       &quot;It is certain that the pipes tremble when they sound together,<br/>although they are not in tune.  For example when they do not make unison, the<br/>octave, or the fifth; and they do not tremble when they are tuned exactly;<br/>thus if one could recognize the number of beats they make when one diminishes<br/>their tuning to render them tempered as required, one would be able to tune<br/>them, because one would diminish their justness until they made the number of<br/>the said beats. For if they ought to beat twenty times in the space of a<br/>measure to be perfectly tempered, it would be necessary simply to observe<br/>this number to put them in tune.  But it is necessary to experiment how many<br/>times the pipes, or the parts of air which are pushed or enclosed within,<br/>sound beats in all the distances from unison and the other consonances, if<br/>one wishes to learn the universal method of tuning the organ.</p><p>    &quot;And if one can recognize these beats or throbbing without the ear, it<br/>will not be necessary in tuning the organ, for if, for example, the pipes<br/>must beat ten times in a second to make the tempered fifth, one will be<br/>assured that the organ will be in tune, when all the fifths beat ten times<br/>and the ear is not necessary for this, if the hands which hold them and touch<br/>the pipes can tell the said number of beats through the sense of touch.</p><p>    &quot;Now this consideration of beats serves not only for recognizing the<br/>tuning and temperament of the organ, but also as the object of an excellent<br/>speculation which consists in searching for the causes of this throbbing,<br/>which is different according as the pipes are more or less removed from the<br/>consonances, since they beat as much when they are lacking a diesis of making<br/>a unison, as when they are removed by a major second and an equal distance<br/>from the fifth does not make them beat like that of the unison.  Thus it is<br/>necessary to consider these distances in as many manners as there are<br/>consonances; for as to the dissonances, they make the pipes beat and throb<br/>even when they are in the exact intervals.  Yet one can consider whether they<br/>make them tremble more or less when they are just than when they are<br/>tempered.&quot;</p><p>        Marin Mersenne (1634) Proposition XXX (p. 450)</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2001 1:08:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Tuners,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Below is a translation of an excerpt from Marin<br/>Mersenne&apos;s &quot;Harmonie<br/>&gt; Universelle&quot; (1634) concerning tuning keyboards by beats.

Because it appears that what he is saying here, is that<br/>one has to know how to set the temperament first _by other means_;<br/>then one can observe _empirically_ and count the beating; and then<br/>use these counts to set the temperament in the future -- and that a<br/>mathematical theory of beating is a matter for future &quot;searching&quot;.<br/>Jorgenson may have overlooked this, but it&apos;s a far cry from actually<br/>_calculating_ the correct beat frequencies a priori.</p><p>Nonetheless, I recall reading in Jorgenson that the theory of beat<br/>frequencies was fully understood long before any tuners actually<br/>_used_ this theory to tune. But how could Jorgenson know what _all_<br/>tuners did or did not use?</p></div>
