Everything you do is but a quick informal experiment.</p><p>Don&apos;t trust it for a minute, Brad. Sorry. I often use 7ths as a tuning<br/>tool on both fortepianos and harpsichords, especially in the brass<br/>strung regions, were they are often quite strong. There is no<br/>technical reason why they should be absent, unless the plucking point<br/>is consistently 1/7th of the string length - highly unlikley.</p><p>I am beginning to think you are actually AFRAID any doing anything<br/>verifiable, like making a recording of selfsame harpsichord notes and<br/>posting it so that those of use who have gone to the minimum effort<br/>(and believe me, these days it is hardly worth a farthing, neither in<br/>time nor money) to acquire some spectral analysis software can<br/>actually SEE what is going on instead of just trusting Brad&apos;s rather<br/>peculiar hearing. Alternatively, you could go to the minimal effort of<br/>acquiring some software yourself. You might learn something...</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@akjmusic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2008 8:21:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Brad,</p><p>It would be nice if you would record this stuff---many people here<br/>would like to hear first hand what you are describing.</p><p>A good pair of flst frequency response binaural mics can be had for<br/>$80.

In the context of my wikipedia article he thought that calling it a birectified hexateron was more appropriate.</p><p>He was asking about the figures at the end of the paper, Kraig. I said I didn&apos;t know what they were - and to get in touch with you if he wanted to know more. Impressive to look at - were they done by hand?</p><p>BTW I just added CPS sets to my Virtual Flower program (not yet uploaded but will do in a day or two for anyone who wants to try it out). For instance you can now show a dekany in 4D and watch it turning around with its 3D projection changing shape as it goes. Later I hope to add in sound as well. It shouldn&apos;t be that hard to do - that you click on a face - to play the triad - thought that maybe I&apos;d do it so that if you click anywhere on the face then the relative volumes of the three notes depend on where you click it.</p><p>Maybe even that if you then slide the mouse around on the face, then the volumes of the notes change depending on proximity of the mouse to the vertex (using the channel volume controller). And note switches off when you lift the mouse again. Or like Dave Keenan&apos;s tumbling dekany, could do so that when you click on a note, it sustains for a predetermined amount of time, and volume then changes as the shape spins around in 3D, so could do it so that user can add notes to the result by clicking on them. Etc., have lots of ideas, and it may not be that hard to do, as I have most of the bits in place, just need a bit of time to work on it, maybe in a week or two.</p><p>Robert<br/>Robert (Walker)</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com">http://www.robertinventor.com</a></p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2008 5:23:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Erv worked as a draftsman so all his diagrams were done by him.
