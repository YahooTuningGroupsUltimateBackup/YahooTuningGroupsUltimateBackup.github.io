Ligetti&apos;s harpsichord solo in meantone is gorgeous. Manfred<br/>&gt; Stahnke sent me a copy. I don&apos;t know if it is commercially available,  &gt; but I will ask him.</p><p>&quot;Commercially available&quot; meaning what?  Published score (yes)? Multitude of recordings (yes)?</p><p>I played that piece on one of my doctoral recitals, back in &apos;94.  The whole recital was of meantone pieces, with Hassler&apos;s &quot;Einmal ging ich spatieren&quot; variations as cornerstone.  The Ligeti piece--_Passacaglia ungherese_--is carefully notated so every single note in it is spelled enharmonically correctly according to the tuning.  Even in the wicked fast spots where it seems as if it almost shouldn&apos;t matter, they&apos;re still spelled correctly even if this makes it hard to read.  Meanwhile, the ostinato (very much like the Pachelbel Canon&apos;s) keeps going and keeps migrating downward; and it&apos;s dogged either above or below by pure major 3rds and pure minor 6ths, the whole way, against the free blitz of the third voice.  Excellent stuff.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
