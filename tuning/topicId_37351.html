If I respond to your reactions<br/>with explanations, I&apos;ll end up rewriting my essay in email messages, which seems<br/>like a little bit of a waste of everyone&apos;s time. For example, I never made rules<br/>about anything being allowable, and I explain what I mean about artistic freedom,<br/>in such a way that you if you had read the essay you might (might) never have had<br/>to make some of the statements you made in this message. We become like a cat<br/>chasing its tail.</p><p>&gt;It gives us freedom only in comparison to that<br/>&gt;more restrictive rule, and gives us nothing by way of structure unless we bring<br/>&gt;something else to the discussion--as I, and many others, would bring in<br/>&gt;particular the approximation of ratios.</p><p>Another example: Read the entire Part 2 of my essay (&quot;What May Happen&quot;), if<br/>you are looking for structure, and for me to bring something more to the<br/>discussion.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2002 3:11:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;In my ideal world it would *always* happen. :)</p><p>&gt; Well, the problem is that, for example here, you are now reacting to my brief<br/>&gt; summaries of the larger points made in my essay.</p><p>That&apos;s why I suggested making a Postscript file or something of that sort available.

However, my point was that &quot;be atonal&quot; or &quot;use an equal temperament&quot; are rules; if you advocate them in any exclusive sense, you advocate a rule defining what can and cannot be done. The same remark applies to Just Intonation or tonality, of course.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2002 9:59:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/37354">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/37354</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;In my ideal world it would *always* happen. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, the problem is that, for example here, you are now reacting<br/>to my brief<br/>&gt; &gt; summaries of the larger points made in my essay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s why I suggested making a Postscript file or something of<br/>that sort available.

Why not create the same set up for<br/>papers that the authors feel strongly about? I would<br/>like to do precisely that for my upcoming paper on<br/>&quot;Non-Deterministic Scales Used in Traditional Turkish<br/>Music&quot;. I would be very much interested in relentless<br/>scrutiny from anyone who would care to comment.</p><p>=====<br/>Can Akkoc<br/>1058 Dickenson Avenue<br/>Mobile, AL 36609<br/>USA<br/>(251)639-1936</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/><a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
