And they needn&apos;t be that<br/>acurate regarding tuning etc [I&apos;ll work that out] what I&apos;m after is just<br/>plain old sheet music.</p><p>Why am I interested in this ? I plan to tune one of my interchangeable<br/>fretboards to some tuning based on babershop music [the other three are<br/>going to be fretted to a tuning Paul Erlich worked out for me and two<br/>others are to tunings by Erv Wilson + I will have a fretless board].</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p><p>This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended solely for<br/>the recipient.
