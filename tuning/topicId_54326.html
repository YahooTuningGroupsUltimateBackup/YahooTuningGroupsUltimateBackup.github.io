Average person<br/>maybe doesn&apos;t even known Euclidean from non-Euclidean.  Myself<br/>included.*</p><p>-Carl</p><p>* I know stuff about, what is it, Euclid&apos;s 5th axiom<br/>about parallel lines that you can violate with either positive<br/>or negative curvature to get Riemannian or hyperbolic geometry<br/>instead.  I know this subsequently effects the angles of a<br/>triangle.  But I&apos;ve never worked with any non-Euclidean<br/>geometry and I&apos;m certainly not qualified to identify it in<br/>obscure situations like JIPs and soforth.</p></div>
