All are written for<br/>gamelan (Harrison&apos;s, specifically) with western<br/>soloists.  I worked extensively with the western<br/>players on the tunings, and we had a lot of<br/>transposition to do, what with the diference in<br/>relative pitches between gamelan sets.</p><p>The Double Concerto, with movements in Pelog, Slendro,<br/>and a transitional section was originally slated but<br/>we decided it was too dificult to play on our<br/>traveling gamelan, which is tuned lower than<br/>Harrison&apos;s, and dipped below the violin&apos;s playable<br/>range.  We&apos;ll probably play the Double Concerto in the<br/>Spring on our bronze instruments whose tuning is<br/>higher (but this will again require transposition of<br/>the original score).  I will try to remember to post a<br/>notice to this list at that time</p><p>Nathaniel Braddock</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
