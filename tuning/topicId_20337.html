Tried uploading it to the ntlworld site,<br/>and ran out of space for it. May be because it is a lot of small<br/>files, - that can use more space than the actual byte contents of<br/>the files.</p><p>You&apos;ll lose the banner add if you click show tree, or no frames<br/>navigation, but I am required to link to it like this to use the site.</p><p>For links to other entries, you can use the relative urls, which<br/>may be more familiar than an invented new notation:</p><p>E.g.</p><p>../margoschulter/why_12_notes</p><p>- note it can be truncated, and you can read the relative urls from<br/>the on-site tree.</p><p>More details in the help for the trees.</p><p>If you use them, remember to place $.$.$ at the head of your document<br/>as a signal to the program that it is okay to search for relative urls in<br/>your ascii document.</p><p>This is the no frames or java version:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/on_site_tree/links.html">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/on_site_tree/links.html</a></p><p>There&apos;s now a complete no frames navigation method for all the trees.</p><p>The ascii faq now shows the relative url at the head of each<br/>entry.<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/ascii_tree/tuning_faq_draft.txt">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/ascii_tree/tuning_faq_draft.txt</a></p><p>This is the consecutively numbered version, and there&apos;s now an on-site<br/>tree which shows the ascii vesions:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/ascii_tree/tree.html">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/ascii_tree/tree.html</a></p><p>I think the relative urls could be useful in the ascii faq for the time being-<br/>so that you can copy them whenever you want to link to one of the other<br/>entries - they can be removed from the final versions of the faqs.</p><p>There&apos;s also a large single document html faq, though I&apos;m not sure<br/>exactly how useful it will be if it gets much larger</p><p>Also made the methods for adding a new entry a bit easier, as a result<br/>of reflecting on what happened with the first few who used it. Please<br/>give it a go so I can have some more feedback about how easy it is to<br/>use and where it still needs to be improved.</p><p>If you need help, I can do some of the entries, only takes a minute or two.<br/>But it really is easy. Comments also welcome, if you can think of a better<br/>way of doing it.</p><p>Notice that when you re-upload a draft, everyone immediately can<br/>see the new version in the Work in Progress tree.</p><p>However, it may be a little while before it is updated in the on-site<br/>tree, and the single document faq - happens whenever they are next<br/>refreshed.</p><p>If you have a Windows machine, you could run my program yourself and<br/>make an up to date copy of the on-site tree on your hard disk whenever<br/>you want to - it&apos;s fairly fast - multi-threaded, and runs at about<br/>a thousand small files ftpd per half hour.</p><p>I tested it by doing an ftp of the last few thousand messages from<br/>the Tuning group web site. So, if anyone is still worried about what<br/>might happen to the Tuning archive in the future, maybe nice to know<br/>it can be rescued if needed in this way.</p><p>Both the on-site tree and the single document faq have some test entries<br/>in them to show the new options.</p><p>I&apos;ve also included my cents to ratios etc. pages, to show the effect of<br/>the auto-conversion from html to ascii.</p><p>It is fairly rudimentary, but could be useful - you could add an html<br/>entry, then once the ascii on-site tree has been refreshed, visit it<br/>and copy the ascii to use it to make your final ascii version.</p><p>For instance, it automatically changes superscripts to a^b, and<br/>changes subscripts to double spaced lines with the subscripts on the<br/>second line.</p><p>However, doesn&apos;t do anything about the different sizes of headings etc<br/>at present, just treats them as new lines, and ignores tables altogether<br/>- for anything complex, would be better to find a dedicated html to ascii<br/>conversion program, which I imagine must exist.</p><p>I think the only thing not included from the original list of suggestions is<br/>automatic re-numbering of sub-sections of an entry - doesn&apos;t seem to be an urgent<br/>need for this, but if anyone needs it, let me know and I&apos;ll see what I<br/>can do - prob. pretty easy to do actually.</p><p>Program even has a tree view which the keeper can use to edit the tree<br/>at a later stage, and at present, can be used to move the entries around,<br/>change the names of the folders, and place the entries in any order<br/>one likes on the tree. (That was the most fiddly part to program -<br/>never did a Windows tree view before, and there is quite a lot to it...).</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;ve rather dropped other things to do this, and haven&apos;t replied<br/>to some posts to the TL that I&apos;d have liked to respond to - will do so<br/>soon,...</p><p>My hope is that with the programming done, it should run pretty much on<br/>auto-pilot from now on, and make things a lot easier for the Keeper of<br/>the FAQ, and for everyone else too. Hope so anyway.</p><p>It was a fun project to do - really enjoyed it,.. Not quite finished<br/>completely, but not much left to do now. Will of course update<br/>if new things are needed later on.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=20535 href="#20535">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/29/2001 7:15:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20337.html#20337">/tuning/topicId_20337.html#20337</a></p><p>Thank you so much, Robert, for your excellent work on the FAQ.

(sorry, John :) ) until there are some new<br/>&gt; entires.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping he can have an easy time of it as far as possible, and<br/>that it can work mostly on auto-pilot for the basic process of<br/>just adding draft entries for everyone to comment on. I&apos;m sure<br/>there will be a fair amount for him to do at some point.</p><p>Unless that is, we want a very disorganised faq with<br/>hardly any system to it! I suppose that has its charms<br/>in a way.</p><p>I&apos;ve made some suggestions about how the tree could be used.<br/>However, it can be adapted depending on how it can be best<br/>used.</p><p>One thing about the present program is that drafts that<br/>have been added to the working draft tree will instanatly update<br/>when you change them, as it is just a list of urls. But, when<br/>you first add a draft to the tree, it will take a little while<br/>before you see it there for the first time. That&apos;s because<br/>it gets into the tree when it is next refreshed.</p><p>John&apos;s idea that one posts the drafts to the TL first, or<br/>possibly simultaneously with the tree would help here, as<br/>one could first post it to the TL, and then it won&apos;t matter<br/>that it might be a day or two, or amaybe longer on occasion,<br/>before it gets into the tree.</p><p>One could perhaps help with this by having perhaps two or three<br/>people all having the ftp password for a single ftp site, so<br/>that any of them can refresh the tree at any time, and it<br/>doesn&apos;t just depend on one person, who might be on holiday,<br/>or be involved in something and forget about it (as I might<br/>if in the middle of some involved programming project), or whatever.</p><p>I&apos;d be happy to share the ncbi ftp password with a couple of others<br/>for this purpose.</p><p>Or maybe it&apos;s better if we start a new site especially - could do<br/>one at ncbi if that&apos;s thought a good idea. I suppose we should also<br/>check if it is okay to share the password like this (as some sites<br/>have a rule about not sharing passwords as one of the conditions<br/>of using the site).</p><p>There are many free web sites, but most have banners, and if not<br/>have other restrictions such as bandwidth or space, or are<br/>so overloaded that it is hard to ftp to them. Makes sense<br/>actually, as if they have unlimited bandwidth / space, probably<br/>costs them some, and they have to get that back somehow.</p><p>Here are the top listed ones without banners. Some have other<br/>restrictions. For instance, <a href="http://doteasy.com">doteasy.com</a> is free and has<br/>no ads, and you even get a free .com web name, but you<br/>have to agree to receive a spam newsletter from them every day.</p><p>Sounds a strange system, as it would be easy for someone to set<br/>up an e-mail address just to receive their spam, and then<br/>block it all, or just not look at it, but that would be dishonest<br/>I feel. It&apos;s new, so it&apos;s early days for it yet.</p><p><a href="http://100best-free-web-space.com/Top10_banner.htm">http://100best-free-web-space.com/Top10_banner.htm</a></p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s okay to have a site with banners? The ncbi one<br/>is relatively unobtrusive as these things go. Though, just an<br/>idea, perhaps would be nice to have one with the banners<br/>related to music in some way if there is a specifically musical<br/>web site provider we could use instead.</p><p>Re-making the trees just involves connecting to the internet, and<br/>clicking a button.</p><p>Then once made, one uploads the newly<br/>made files to the web site, which again, in a modern sophisticated<br/>ftp program like WS_FTPLE, is just a matter of highlighting the<br/>folder that includes all the new tree files, and uploading it to<br/>a folder of the same name on the web site, and leaving it to<br/>get on with it.</p><p>Another thing one can do is to make the tree oneself off-site,<br/>and anyone with my program will be able to do that, but that<br/>is an incomplete solution as it only runs on Windows machines<br/>at present.</p><p>It&apos;s also going to be open source.</p><p>It relies a fair amount on windows subroutines.</p><p>Much of that is for sorting, so could be re-written easily, so possibly much<br/>of the central part of the program could be ported by re-writing a few of the<br/>c-subroutines it calls.</p><p>However as it is written as a Windows program, ti would prob.<br/>require a fair amount of work to have the same amount of<br/>interactivity and features, especially as it is also<br/>written at a fairly low level in c. There was no choice -<br/>I&apos;ve rather specialised in this way of programming, and<br/>couldn&apos;t run off a program in anything like the same<br/>period of time in any other language.</p><p>It might be reasonably easy to do a batch version at some<br/>stage that runs from the MSDOS prompt in windows, and just<br/>re-makes the trees from the database, with no interactivity<br/>involved. That then could easily be ported to<br/>any other OS as it could be written in standard ANSI c.<br/>It more or less works like that anyway, as it launches the<br/>tree making subroutine in a separate thread.</p><p>One other thing to bear in mind, at present it depends on that<br/>tree applet.</p><p>It&apos;s an attractive applet. However, it is limited to about 50<br/>entries.</p><p>You need to pay $70 for each instance of the applet for more than<br/>that.</p><p>Especially with my idea of releasing it as a general program for<br/>making FAQs for Yahoo groups, I&apos;d like to find a free alternative.</p><p>Either one already available, or to write it myself (which would<br/>be easy in Windows C, but I&apos;m not that familiar with Java yet,<br/>and would also need to learn its gui and graphics first).</p><p>Could be more basic, but functional. I don&apos;t suppose anyone knows<br/>of a free one? Or is anyone on the list sufficiently fluent in java to<br/>run one off in a short while, and contribute it to the project?</p><p>Of course, it does have an alternative navigation system already<br/>in the non-forms based navigation, however I think it does<br/>really make quite a difference to be able to use some kind of<br/>graphical tree.</p><p>&gt; At this point, I believe the usefulness of the FAQ will depend upon<br/>&gt; new CONTENT that can be included, so if anybody wants to write<br/>&gt; something up, it will be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Somehow, I don&apos;t think we are going to be short of interesting and<br/>useful content!!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sorry that the interesting FAQ on meantone by Daniel Wolf was not<br/>&gt; included.  In fact, I didn&apos;t see anything presently on meantone at<br/>&gt; all... am I missing something??</p><p>I can add any FAQs anyone wants me to do. However if I add<br/>them, say to the files area, then they can&apos;t be edited any more<br/>by the original authors. Means that if they need to update the draft,<br/>they need to resend a copy to whoever uploaded the original.</p><p>So, probably best if anyone who has posted drafts to the TL<br/>uploadS their draft to the file area.</p><p>I can add the entry to the FAQ tree, or you could, or they could<br/>themselves.</p><p>It&apos;s quite fast to do, just a few minutes, so wouldn&apos;t be much trouble<br/>to keep up with the current rate at which drafts are being added to the<br/>TL. I might easily miss a few for a few days, but I suppose you&apos;d<br/>probably notice any that I miss, as you are very active on the list.</p><p>It would be possible to just put an entry up as an idea for comment,<br/>and remove it later, perhaps to have some of its material re-cycled<br/>into other entries.</p><p>One way to do that would be to have another<br/>option in the y/n field - one could place a c<br/>there which will mean the entry is shown only in the working draft tree,<br/>and won&apos;t be ftp&apos;d to the on-site tree.</p><p>I think that is probably the easiest way to do such a thing.<br/>(N.b. - I haven&apos;t done it yet, but after we&apos;ve thought it over,<br/>will prob. do it).</p><p>Once ftp&apos;d to the on-site tree, it is also easy to remove it again,<br/>just by removing an entry from the database, which will remove<br/>it from the links in the on-site tree.</p><p>However the file itself would still be there on the web site, unless<br/>the entire on-site tree was deleted and re-made.</p><p>My program doesn&apos;t work directly with the ftp upload. Instead,<br/>it saves to disk, and one then uploads from disk using your<br/>ftp program - there was so much involved in the passwords etc.<br/>and other programs do that side of things so well already.</p><p>It could if necessary maintain a list of all files in the tree,<br/>and then compare lists to make a list of all the ones to be<br/>deleted, and that would be easy. However at present it can&apos;t<br/>actually do the deleting. So prob. best not to add an faq<br/>to the on-site tree if it is just for comment.</p><p>John hasn&apos;t said that much yet about his plans, and I&apos;d like<br/>to see what he thinks.</p><p>I&apos;ve nearly finished the FAQ tree program, with an editable tree<br/>in it.</p><p>I&apos;m expecting the editable tree to be used to make the introductory FAQ<br/>one would send newbies to the list to, and probably other faq selections<br/>from the complete on-site tree.</p><p>Also, anyone with a windows machine will be able to use it themselves to<br/>make an off-site copy of the trees - for instance they could<br/>use it to make an edited ascii faq with only the entries they want<br/>to print out. Also to make the trees off-site if I haven&apos;t got<br/>round to doing it. Those who have another OS, would need to ask<br/>someone with a Windows machine to do it for them, but that shouldn&apos;t<br/>be too hard I hope.</p><p>&gt; Looking forward to some more submissions in the course of our various<br/>&gt; discussions here on the list...</p><p>Yes, indeed,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
