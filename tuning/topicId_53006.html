A couple of tracks employ Kraig Grady&apos;s &apos;Centaur&apos; tuning, one<br/>employs Paul Hahn&apos;s 32-consonance one, one track uses 7-tet, and a couple of<br/>others are so wacky-timbred out, that tuning is almost irrelevant (although<br/>technically, probably one of the above)</p><p>The CD&apos;s will be sold for $15. Eventually, we will have a CD-Baby page, and<br/>something on our website--but for now, if you can&apos;t wait, contact me at info<br/>at <a href="http://dividebypi.com">dividebypi.com</a>, and we can exchange goods and money the old fashioned way:<br/>checks and snail mail!</p><p>All Best,<br/>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a></p><p>OCEAN, n.

I will make a brief<br/>email announcement in this group when that happens. The price will be $15<br/>plus shipping and handling.
