It just applies to intervals, not<br/>&gt; unison.</p><p>Dear Oz,</p><p>one thing that is confusing some people is the multiple meaning of<br/>inversion. The first meaning, e.g. in &quot;inverting a melody&quot;, is when<br/>you take a tune and play it &quot;upside down&quot;, so ascending major thirds,<br/>for example, become descending major thirds. This kind of inversion<br/>requires an axis of symmetry, when it deals with pitches rather than<br/>pitch-classes. Then you can also invert chords. A C-major triad in<br/>root position, inverts into a root-position F-minor triad when<br/>inverted around its root. Invert it around its fifth instead, and it<br/>becomes a G-minor triad. Invert it around an axis of inversion halfway<br/>between Eb and E, and it becomes a C minor triad.</p><p>If you&apos;re working in a universe of pitch-_classes_ rather than<br/>pitches, then no literal axis of inversion need appear. C-E-G can<br/>invert into C#-F#-A, for example. In this sense any minor triad, in<br/>any spacing and position, is the inversion of any major triad.</p><p>The second meaning of inversion, which you are talking about, requires<br/>more than one voice or instrumental part combined in a structure.<br/>Inverting the structure means changing the order of its voices--it<br/>would be better if it were called &quot;permuting&quot;, but it&apos;s not. If the<br/>three voices form a structure of C-E-G, then inverting them can lead<br/>to another position of the chord, e.g. E-C-G. Here we have an<br/>inversion, in the second sense of the word, of a C-major triad.</p><p>&quot;Inversion at the octave&quot; is an operation that is applied to a<br/>contrapuntal structure of several parts. If there are two parts, call<br/>them A above B (they are both melodic strands in a multipart<br/>composition), and some time later in the composition we get B above<br/>A--i.e. the structure has been permuted--then we have &quot;invertible<br/>counterpoint&quot;. We call it &quot;invertible counterpoint at the octave&quot; if<br/>the difference in the intervals of transposition is an octave. For<br/>example, if A stays put and B moves up an octave; or B stays put and A<br/>moves down an octave; or A moves down a 3rd and B up a 6th; or A moves<br/>up a second and B moves up a ninth - etc. etc. etc.  All of those are<br/>called &quot;inversion at the octave&quot; in traditional music theory.</p><p>Of course, if A and B are ever separated by more than an octave in<br/>their original appearance, then when you perform the operation on the<br/>contrapuntal structure known as &quot;inversion at the octave&quot; then they<br/>won&apos;t have actually changed positions! In this sense of inversion, the<br/>&quot;inversion&quot; of a ninth is a second, and the inversion of an octave is<br/>indeed a unison.</p><p>Inversion at the octave is not the only possible inversion. There is<br/>also inversion at the twelfth, where the displacements sum to a<br/>twelfth. Zarlino also shows several examples of inversion at the tenth<br/>(this is quite hard to write so both versions come out sounding ok).<br/>Sometimes, in a 3-voice structure, the relative position of only two<br/>of the three voices is affected. A very common thing in 3-voice<br/>renaissance counterpoint is a structure ABC at one point in the piece,<br/>followed by ACB later on, where A is unchanged but B and C have been<br/>inverted at the twelfth.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if any of that will help, but quite apart from the<br/>mathematical arguments you have been given (which I agree with), there<br/>is a history of usage of the term &quot;inversion&quot; that is much wider than<br/>maybe you knew.</p><p>Cordially, in friendship --Jeremy Targett</p></div><h3><a id=65147 href="#65147">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2006 2:55:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jeremy Targett&quot; &lt;jeremy.targett@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; one thing that is confusing some people is the multiple meaning of<br/>&gt; inversion.

I certainly did a lot of that during theory and<br/>composition days in school, much less so now (well, I may _think_ it,<br/>just not talk about it!).</p><p>I haven&apos;t, for the life of me, been able to see how this is such a<br/>compelling docu-drama. The earliest study of chord inversion in<br/>Western music theory teachings - which, I am assuming, is where _most_<br/>of our correspondents cut their teeth - explains the inversion of<br/>intervals in a chord to form chord inversions. C major triad in root<br/>position has C on bottom; transpose that C up one octave, leaving the<br/>third on the bottom, is a 1st inversion chord. The only thing that<br/>moved was the C, so it formed an inversion at the octave. Had two<br/>voices been singing a C, and one jumps up an octave, they have gone<br/>from the relationship of a unison to one of an octave. If the octave<br/>is an interval, and all the other notes of the chord are referred to<br/>(as relationships) as intervals, it seems that utilizing the term of<br/>&quot;an interval of a unison&quot; just follows the logic of the analysis.</p><p>But what do I know - I&apos;m just a musician! :)</p><p>Don&apos;t know if this shed any light, but it beats working on my taxes...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=65149 href="#65149">ðŸ”—</a>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@online.de&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2006 3:15:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jeremy Targett&quot; &lt;jeremy.targett@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; one thing that is confusing some people is the multiple meaning of<br/>&gt;&gt; inversion.

Most<br/>people mistakenly associate the notion of the &quot;inversion of an<br/>interval&quot; with the &quot;turning something upside down&quot; idea because it<br/>uses the same name, but in fact the &quot;inversion of an interval&quot; is<br/>really a permutation of its elements, same as the inversion of a chord<br/>from root-position to first inversion. (I prefer the use of &quot;position&quot;<br/>for this sense when not modified by an ordinal e.g. &quot;what position is<br/>the seventh chord in?&quot; &quot;Third inversion&quot;.) And both of these have the<br/>same underlying sense as the kind of inversion in invertible<br/>counterpoint--a permutation of the voices.</p><p>In &quot;inversion at the octave&quot;, you invert (in the sense of permute) the<br/>two-voice structure, but given the specific interval mentioned, the<br/>operation might lead to some intervals in the resulting counterpoint<br/>not exchanging positions, but rather being brought an octave closer<br/>together (a tenth might become a third or vice-versa, if the parts<br/>were crossed to begin with). A tenth isn&apos;t what Ozan would consider<br/>&quot;the inversion of a third&quot; either, but it IS a result of the<br/>contrapuntal operation that we call &quot;inversion at the octave&quot;.</p><p>Same goes for other intervals of inversion: when you&apos;re performing<br/>&quot;invertible counterpoint at the twelfth&quot;, an octave inverts into a<br/>fifth.

It&apos;s the standard term, from Bach<br/>&gt; &gt; fugue subjects to Schoenberg&apos;s rows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since Schoenberg&apos;s rows involve pitch classes, not pitches, I wonder<br/>&gt; if you understood what I&apos;m asking. When people talk about Bach<br/>&gt; inverting a fugue subject, do they always require a strict mirror<br/>&gt; inversion, sending major to minor and vice versa?</p><p>An inversion of a Bach fugue subject is usually diatonic, not exact.<br/>So some kind of ascending third gets mapped to some kind of descending<br/>third, major or minor. This doesn&apos;t matter in that it is still a<br/>*reflective* inversion rather than a *permutation*.</p><p>In 12-tone practice the reflective inversion is exact, because you are<br/>operating in a universe of 12 tones rather than 7 diatonic tones. You<br/>could think of the diatonic inversion in Bach as being exact within<br/>the realm of the seven diatonic notes. Here is an example, from WTCI:</p><p>original subject: Eb-Bb-Cb-Bb-Ab-Gb-Ab-Bb-Eb-Ab-Gb-F-Eb<br/>inversion, which first appears in the bass about halfway through the piece:<br/>Bb-Eb-D-Eb-F-Gb-F-Eb-Bb-Eb-F-Gn-Ab</p><p>contour is preserved (up to reflection), i.e. this is a reflection in<br/>pitch, not just pitch-class space. It is an exact inversion in<br/>diatonic space, and a less strict inversion in chromatic space. Some<br/>theorists refer to these as &quot;generically exact&quot; and &quot;specifically<br/>inexact&quot;.</p><p>The distinction between &quot;tonal&quot; and &quot;real&quot; is a different one in<br/>traditional counterpoint theory. A &quot;real&quot; answer to the subject above<br/>would start:</p><p>Bb-F-Gb-F-Eb-Db-Eb-F...</p><p>but a &quot;tonal&quot; answer, which Bach uses in this piece and roughly half<br/>the time in WTC, goes like this:</p><p>Bb-Eb-Gb-F-Eb-Db-Eb-F...</p><p>i.e. you are permitted to answer &quot;1-5&quot; by &quot;5-1&quot;, exchanging 4ths for<br/>5ths. Bach does this when he is still in the tonic at the entrance of<br/>the second voice. If he has modulated to V for the entrance of the 2nd<br/>voice, he will use a real answer. Here he is still in Eb minor at the<br/>entrance of the 2nd voice, and Bb-F wouldn&apos;t fit.</p><p>In Schoenberg&apos;s practice, you can be assured of a reflective inversion<br/>in 12-tone pitch-*class* space, but not in pitch-space--the contour is<br/>almost never preserved.</p><p>Summing up, we have:</p><p>inversion can mean reflection or permutation.</p><p>Reflection can be in pitch space or pitch-class space.</p><p>Reflection can be exact (chromatic), as in Schoenberg, or diatonic, as in Bach.</p><p>In specific baroque practices, a subject can be imitated (whether in<br/>inversion or &quot;right way up&quot;) *tonally* which is even looser than<br/>diatonic, in that 4ths can replace 5ths and vice-versa, in order to<br/>preserve key. &quot;Real&quot; vs &quot;tonal&quot; usually refer to a &quot;right-way-up&quot;<br/>imitation, but could also be used to refer to imitation by inversion<br/>when diatonic interval-classes are not preserved exactly.</p><p>Jeremy</p></div><h3><a id=65191 href="#65191">ðŸ”—</a>Jeremy Targett &#x3C;jeremy.targett@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 10:00:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By the way, I should add that the Bach fugue I quoted (no.8, book 1 of<br/>WTC) appears in many editions in D# minor rather than Eb minor. I<br/>think this is Bach&apos;s original notation--he wrote the prelude in Eb<br/>minor but the fugue in D# minor. I always thought Ebm was a much<br/>friendlier choice, as so many of the chromatic alterations are towards<br/>the sharp side, and I&apos;d rather read naturals in a context of 6 flats,<br/>than double-sharps in a context of 6 sharps!</p><p>I just read Jon Sz&apos;s message about not recognising the use of<br/>inversion to mean reflection in pitch-class space, i.e. C-E-G can be<br/>inverted into C#-F#-A. It&apos;s true that inversion (in the mirror<br/>reflection sense) has been more often talked about as a melodic<br/>phenomenon, in pitch-space, rather than having to do with chords. But<br/>in atonal theory, *anything* can be reflected. Rather than a<br/>pitch-axis of reflection, you talk about an index of reflection, like<br/>this:</p><p>0..4..7<br/>1..9..6<br/>-------<br/>1..1..1</p><p>(0,4,7 represents C,E,G; 1,9,6 represents C#,A,F#; each column sums to<br/>1 mod 12--so 1 is the index of inversion. There doesn&apos;t have to be an<br/>axis of inversion. This is all standard atonal theory, see Rahn,<br/>Straus or Forte for example.)</p><p>We write the index of inversion as a subscript to the inversion<br/>operator I, like this:  I_1({C,E,G}) = {C#,F#,A}. I_2(CM) would be Gm;<br/>I_0(CM) would be Fm, and so forth.</p><p>I_n is equivalent to T_n(I_0). But maybe this stuff should be on tuning math...</p><p>Another &quot;by the way&quot;: all the harmonic dualists in the 19th century<br/>made a big deal of the fact the minor triad is the inversion of the<br/>major triad. So the idea of inverting a chord by mirroring it dates<br/>from much further back than atonal theory.</p><p>The common usage of &quot;inversion&quot; to mean the different positions of a<br/>triad comes from the French &quot;renversement&quot; by the way, which I believe<br/>was introduced by Rameau sometime in the first half of the 1700s. In<br/>French, as in English, the only important tone for determining which<br/>&quot;renversement&quot; a chord is in is the bass tone. So (reading upwards)<br/>E-G-C and E-C-G have always been considered the same &quot;renversement&quot;.<br/>With that in mind maybe &quot;permutation&quot; wouldn&apos;t have been a good name<br/>after all.</p><p>Jeremy</p></div><h3><a id=65204 href="#65204">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 12:24:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And yes, since both the Bach and Schoenberg versions<br/>&gt; generally invoke octave-equivalence, when looked at<br/>&gt; that way, you get the &quot;major turns into minor&quot; effect<br/>&gt; you&apos;re talking about, but the intervals also become<br/>&gt; totally different, i.e., when a major-3rd upward becomes<br/>&gt; a major-3rd downward, that&apos;s the same as a minor-6th upward.</p><p>Which means you have still more variant notions of inversion,<br/>depending on whether octave equivalency is assumed or not.

It just applies to intervals,<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; unison.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Oz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; one thing that is confusing some people is the multiple meaning of<br/>&gt; inversion. The first meaning, e.g. in &quot;inverting a melody&quot;, is when<br/>&gt; you take a tune and play it &quot;upside down&quot;, so ascending major thirds,<br/>&gt; for example, become descending major thirds.</p><p>Augh. You had to put your finger in it now, didn&apos;t you?</p><p>This kind of inversion<br/>&gt; requires an axis of symmetry, when it deals with pitches rather than<br/>&gt; pitch-classes.</p><p>Diatonical melodic inversion is hardly anything like chord inversions.<br/>Whole-tones and semi-tones may be swapped in an inversion of a theme, so<br/>that the resultant melody is harmonically agreeable.</p><p>Then you can also invert chords. A C-major triad in<br/>&gt; root position, inverts into a root-position F-minor triad when<br/>&gt; inverted around its root.</p><p>What? Which base pitch did you transpose where to come to F-minor? The only<br/>inversions of the C-major triad are the ones I have already given.</p><p>Do you mean inverting by a seventh down?</p><p>G<br/>E   E<br/>C  C  C<br/>    A  A<br/>        F</p><p>But this is modulation, not inversion, and it does not yield a minor triad<br/>on F.</p><p>Oo, you mean a diatonical mirror operation of a theme:</p><p>C  D   E    F  G<br/>C  Bb Ab  G  F</p><p>You are simply changing the direction of intervals with C as 1/1.</p><p>Invert it around its fifth instead, and it<br/>&gt; becomes a G-minor triad.</p><p>You mean:</p><p>G   A   B   C   D<br/>G   F   Eb  D  C</p><p>Invert it around an axis of inversion halfway<br/>&gt; between Eb and E, and it becomes a C minor triad.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You mean:</p><p>E   F   G<br/>Eb D   C</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re working in a universe of pitch-_classes_ rather than<br/>&gt; pitches, then no literal axis of inversion need appear. C-E-G can<br/>&gt; invert into C#-F#-A, for example. In this sense any minor triad, in<br/>&gt; any spacing and position, is the inversion of any major triad.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This only serves to complicate matters even more. One must not confuse<br/>interval inversions with chord inversions.</p><p>And I cannot imagine an inversion without an axis of symmetry.</p><p>&gt; The second meaning of inversion, which you are talking about, requires<br/>&gt; more than one voice or instrumental part combined in a structure.<br/>&gt; Inverting the structure means changing the order of its voices--it<br/>&gt; would be better if it were called &quot;permuting&quot;, but it&apos;s not.</p><p>Permuting... That&apos;s a great word. We must say chord permutations then. Let&apos;s<br/>establish this as a rule in this list.</p><p>If the<br/>&gt; three voices form a structure of C-E-G, then inverting them can lead<br/>&gt; to another position of the chord, e.g. E-C-G. Here we have an<br/>&gt; inversion, in the second sense of the word, of a C-major triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Inversion at the octave&quot; is an operation that is applied to a<br/>&gt; contrapuntal structure of several parts.</p><p>That&apos;s invertible counterpoint, double, triple or quadruple, etc...</p><p>If there are two parts, call<br/>&gt; them A above B (they are both melodic strands in a multipart<br/>&gt; composition), and some time later in the composition we get B above<br/>&gt; A--i.e. the structure has been permuted--then we have &quot;invertible<br/>&gt; counterpoint&quot;.</p><p>But you used permutation here again, as in, changing the order of. The order<br/>of pitches in a melody have not been changed, so this should be called<br/>inversion proper.</p><p>We call it &quot;invertible counterpoint at the octave&quot; if<br/>&gt; the difference in the intervals of transposition is an octave. For<br/>&gt; example, if A stays put and B moves up an octave; or B stays put and A<br/>&gt; moves down an octave; or A moves down a 3rd and B up a 6th; or A moves<br/>&gt; up a second and B moves up a ninth - etc. etc. etc.  All of those are<br/>&gt; called &quot;inversion at the octave&quot; in traditional music theory.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; Of course, if A and B are ever separated by more than an octave in<br/>&gt; their original appearance, then when you perform the operation on the<br/>&gt; contrapuntal structure known as &quot;inversion at the octave&quot; then they<br/>&gt; won&apos;t have actually changed positions! In this sense of inversion, the<br/>&gt; &quot;inversion&quot; of a ninth is a second, and the inversion of an octave is<br/>&gt; indeed a unison.</p><p>As long as we reserve the word permutation for what was known previously as<br/>&grave;chord inversions&grave;. Now the matter is resolved! However, say instead<br/>inversion by ..., not inversion of ...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Inversion at the octave is not the only possible inversion. There is<br/>&gt; also inversion at the twelfth, where the displacements sum to a<br/>&gt; twelfth. Zarlino also shows several examples of inversion at the tenth<br/>&gt; (this is quite hard to write so both versions come out sounding ok).<br/>&gt; Sometimes, in a 3-voice structure, the relative position of only two<br/>&gt; of the three voices is affected. A very common thing in 3-voice<br/>&gt; renaissance counterpoint is a structure ABC at one point in the piece,<br/>&gt; followed by ACB later on, where A is unchanged but B and C have been<br/>&gt; inverted at the twelfth.</p><p>This was most refreshing. It&apos;s been quite a while since I pondered upon<br/>these.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know if any of that will help, but quite apart from the<br/>&gt; mathematical arguments you have been given (which I agree with), there<br/>&gt; is a history of usage of the term &quot;inversion&quot; that is much wider than<br/>&gt; maybe you knew.</p><p>I simply ignored this part in my obsession with chord inversions. You have<br/>been most helpful.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cordially, in friendship --Jeremy Targett<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Gratefully,<br/>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=65245 href="#65245">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 3:36:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The problem with these chord inversions is that the final note would<br/>&gt; &gt; also be inverted to be the fifth instead of the root. Common practice<br/>&gt; &gt; has no use for that, as far as I know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which agrees with what I was claiming--that &quot;inversion&quot; does not<br/>&gt; ordinarily mean strict mirror inversion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Of course.
