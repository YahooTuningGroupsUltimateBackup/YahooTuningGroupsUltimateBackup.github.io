It&apos;s at:  <a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a></p><p>Once you choose a keyboard that has that ability, then we can answer that<br/>question in more detail.</p><p>&gt; Where can I get a neck for a guitar that&apos;s fretted with different spacing...<br/>19 per octave, etc.?</p><p>Well, it&apos;s really not all that difficult to refret a guitar yourself, as long as<br/>you have a typical<br/>handyman-like skill and have a Luthier&apos;s Merchantile catalog (800) 477-4437),<br/>and know how<br/>to perform a few pretty simple calculations.  I suggest you start with a cheapie<br/>guitar that you<br/>can &quot;throw away&quot; (more likely figuratively speaking than literally) as a<br/>first-try learning<br/>experience.  That is, if you&apos;re into $1000 guitars, I suggest doing a cheaper<br/>one first.</p></div>
