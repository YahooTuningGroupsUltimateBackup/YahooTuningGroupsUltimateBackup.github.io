The question is then &quot;how much</p><p>&gt;like 12tet?&quot;, and the answer probably sounded something like one of &quot;well<br/>&gt;temperaments&quot; then being propagated as solutions allowing one to play in<br/>all<br/>&gt;keys of a 12-tone cycle.</p><p>As I wrote in my response to Margo, I strongly agree.</p><p>&gt;I think that Paul Erlich and I agree that meantone largely defines the<br/>&gt;resources and limitations of the common practice harmonic language, and<br/>that<br/>&gt;there was an initial move towards equal temperament in the late Baroque<br/>(the<br/>&gt;so-called well temperaments) that did not really become realized in a final</p><p>&gt;way until the middle of the 19th century. Thus, while there is some Baroque</p><p>&gt;repertoire -- like the WTC -- that demands something other than meantone<br/>(or<br/>&gt;meantone plus an active tuning hammer), the music of the Viennese classical</p><p>&gt;era, which sticks to the best meantone keys, largely remains within the<br/>&gt;limits of meantone.</p><p>I think that the compositional problems that drew Bach and his immediate<br/>successors away from meantone were nothing more than the logistics of<br/>getting an extended meantone (I believe Bach used 25 notated pitches in his<br/>works) out of a 12-key instrument. If keyboards such as the Fokker organ<br/>were widely available in Bach&apos;s day, there would have been no need to stray<br/>from meantone temperament, as 25 notes per octave would have fallen easily<br/>under the hands of the performer. Unfortunately, instrument making did not<br/>keep pace with compositional imagination, and circular temperament was the<br/>only solution. Even Mozart, as we&apos;ve discussed, regularly used more than 12<br/>notated pitches in his meantone-conceived music, so temperament would have<br/>been a necessity for much of his music as well. Not until the 1800s did<br/>composers really begin using 12-tone circular temperament in ways beyond<br/>what extended meantone makes possible -- for example, applying diminshed<br/>seventh chords to resolve a minor third or tritone away from where expected,<br/>or modulating rapidly and repeatedly though major thirds, which only returns<br/>to the same key in a 12-tone circular temperament.</p></div><h3><a id=6494 href="#6494">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
