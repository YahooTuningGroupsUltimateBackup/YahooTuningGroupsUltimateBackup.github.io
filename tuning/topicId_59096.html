But its wide-spread usage in music institutions all over the country is pretty recent, going only as far past as two decades I believe. The reason is due to the fact that secterianism between the Kemalist puritans and Maqam Music advocates (who are seperated into many sects themselves) reached its pinnacle during late 1970s, whereby the tide turned in favor of Maqam Music to the detriment Kemalists, resulting in the foundation of the first convervatory primarily geared for Maqam Music education. Yes, you guessed right, it is the conservatory where I am pursuing my doctorate career now.</p><p>The whole business of commas come into play because of the need to identify pitches unique to Turkish Maqam Music (and incidentally, Folk Music). Why else would a Turkish Nationalist school based on Western atonality (or crooked forms of tonality for that matter), require 53tET especially when all their symphony orchestras and chamber music ensembles are educated to play by only 12-tones? Why would they need to learn microtonality when all they can do is play Western Classical Music in their pompous concert halls crowded by hapless audiences?</p><p>Microtonality? None of the Westernized musicians here know how to go about it. I myself have experienced an ignominous defeat by their hands when my own amateurish microtonal composition was brutalized the previous year.</p><p>Thus, the application of 53tET was limited to theory books and articles written by eccentric theorists who were lucky to find a bunch of musicians that they were able to educate.</p><p>Today, however, the &quot;comma&quot; has been robbed of its functional status, and instead, is frequently used to refer to the &quot;smallest conceived audible interval that makes a difference&quot;. It is therefore employed by those who care about music beyond 12-tones. Apparently, Arel-Ezgi theory was the culprit for the &quot;scourge of the comma&quot; around these parts. Fortunately, the majority of the Arabs succumbed to the &quot;quarter-tone&quot; instead.</p><p>For gosh sakes, Maqam musicians here cannot think in other terms, but the comma! Yet, it makes no difference to anyone whether the sound system, knowingly or unknowingly, implemented is actually 53tET or not. For one thing, they don&apos;t even know any comma other than ditonic. They are not even aware as to how a pure third ought to be expressed. Their scorn for meantone temperaments, without realizing their depth, is truly astonishing.</p><p>I was apalled by the fact that one of the eldest and greatest Qanun makers in Turkey-Izmir had consigned to 100 cents for the semitones. I was shocked to learn of it when the first Qanun I acquired from him was so built. It was equally apalling to learn that one of the greatest Qanun virtuosos of Turkey, Ruhi Ayangil, is the possessor of Qanuns that have their latches affixed at 100 cents per semitone.</p><p>&apos;Twas but madness to be ignorant, or worse, uncaring of such a thing. I immediately discovered the problem that could not be resolved by simple tuning tricks, and ordered another Qanun as a replacement. Even then, I had to specify my exact intentions despite the fact that I was a genuine ignoramus in tuning back then, and realized later on that I had specified 70tET by instinct.</p><p>My observations tell me, that 60tET is inferred today even when thinking and talking in terms of 53tET. Thus, the distinction between a 4-comma sharp and 5-comma sharp has already dissapeared, resulting in a chaos that awaits immediate resolution for the sake of Maqam Music education. Ignorance and ineptitude has reached unbelievable levels it seems.</p><p>Why would a meantone fifth be chosen for drones and pedal tones? It is required simply for the correct notation of Rast. And besides, I aim to make use of it only with the Qanuns, and consign it to paper in theory. Of course the ear wants to hear the pure fifth resonating. I cannot help it if Western Staff Notation has no provisions for the distinction between Rast and Suz-i Dilara. If I am to think in terms of 53tET, or 159tET for that matter, I have to specify a &quot;comma-flat&quot; for the 3rd, 6th and 7th degrees for the Rast Maqam. Do you find it correct that the &quot;Mother of All Maqams&quot; is expressed with flats in the key signature while Suz-i Dilara is not?</p><p>Meantone is the way to the rescue out of this mess, and I don&apos;t give a darn anymore if the fifth is way too flat to achieve the near-correct pitches.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Kraig Grady<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 13 Haziran 2005 Pazartesi 17:59<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Digest Number 3551</p><p>  hi Ozan!<br/>  I seem to remember the turkish music has a long history with 53 form<br/>  the documents i have seen at least a hundred years old , going buy the<br/>  turkish book found in  UCLA library, as well as quite a bit that Lou<br/>  Harrison had in his pocession, as far as recordings.<br/>  I have never heard any turkish person mention 60 ET unless this is a<br/>  recent development, which seems to be an awkward concession to european<br/>  tuning.  Since turkish music uses enough drones and pedal tones in more<br/>  recent music , the idea of a meantone fifth doesn&apos;t sound right, just<br/>  for this reason. or from worknig with a meantone system, does such a<br/>  system seem to relate to  music of this area.<br/>  In fact it turns it back on everyone east of them. 53 and subsets of it<br/>  have been around for centuries thoughout this entire region. I cannot<br/>  believe it didnt make it to turkey until recently.</p></div><h3><a id=59099 href="#59099">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2005 11:04:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Ozan,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Today, however, the &quot;comma&quot; has been robbed of its<br/>&gt; functional status, and instead, is frequently used to<br/>&gt; refer to the &quot;smallest conceived audible interval that<br/>&gt; makes a difference&quot;.</p><p>if you study Indian music and try to find out exactly<br/>what is meant by &quot;sruti&quot;, you&apos;re going to end up with<br/>exactly the same definition.  ;-)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=59102 href="#59102">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2005 12:24:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Meantone is the way to the rescue out of this mess, and I don&apos;t give<br/>a darn anymore if the fifth is way too flat to achieve the<br/>near-correct pitches.</p><p>So why not do the obvious, and use 19 or 31?</p></div><h3><a id=59104 href="#59104">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2005 12:34:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Meantone is the way to the rescue out of this mess, and I don&apos;t give<br/>&gt; a darn anymore if the fifth is way too flat to achieve the<br/>&gt; near-correct pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So why not do the obvious, and use 19 or 31?</p><p>Speaking of which, here is 19 notes of meantone in 159-et, in terms of<br/>step sizes:</p><p>[8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 8, 9]</p><p>Here&apos;s 12:</p><p>[8, 17, 8, 17, 8, 17, 17, 8, 17, 8, 17, 17]</p></div><h3><a id=59106 href="#59106">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2005 2:19:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Verbal abuse knows no bounds!</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: monz<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 13 Haziran 2005 Pazartesi 21:04<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: 53tET is not the right system for Maqam Music Notation</p><p>  hi Ozan,</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; Today, however, the &quot;comma&quot; has been robbed of its<br/>  &gt; functional status, and instead, is frequently used to<br/>  &gt; refer to the &quot;smallest conceived audible interval that<br/>  &gt; makes a difference&quot;.</p><p>  if you study Indian music and try to find out exactly<br/>  what is meant by &quot;sruti&quot;, you&apos;re going to end up with<br/>  exactly the same definition.  ;-)</p><p>  -monz<br/>  <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>  Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=59108 href="#59108">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2005 2:30:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The number of pitches are not sufficient, some are horribly wrong and they do a great disservice to Maqam Music. 31 was good for starters, but I saw that it was not possible to make the distinction between Rast and Suz-i Dilara among many other things.
