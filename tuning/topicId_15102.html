Really shows off the<br/>colorfulness of the tuning!  Harmonia is<br/>on the web Thursday nights at 9 PM<br/>Central Standard Time so the whole world<br/>can hear it.  Problem is, I don&apos;t know<br/>what&apos;s going to be on it until then.<br/>Wish I did, because it frequently<br/>contains wonderful examples of<br/>historical tunings.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
