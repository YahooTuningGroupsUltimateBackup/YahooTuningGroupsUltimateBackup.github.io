The two violinists<br/>from the Stamic Quartet, who played it, told me they weren&apos;t so much<br/>*calculating* their intonation by cents or by ratios. &quot;We rather trust our<br/>ears&quot;, they said,  &quot;somewhere in between we always find the pitch that<br/>fits.&quot; I really liked their performance. In fact they have recorded or are<br/>recording all Haba quartets. For information, mail to Vitezslav Cernoch, the<br/>first violinist:<br/><a href="mailto:vcernoch@iol.cz">vcernoch@iol.cz</a><br/>Furthermore, the grandson of a sister of Haba&apos;s wife has founded the Haba<br/>Information Center in Prague. He&apos;s very enthousiastic and should have all<br/>the scores you need. He produced a triple CD with most of Haba&apos;s works (the<br/>ones for guitar are still unrecorded...). In fact, he&apos;s not a musician but a<br/>biologist. (That&apos;s even better. Thank you, David!) Unfortunately he has got<br/>neither e-mail nor fax (they seem to turn out black sometimes in the Czech<br/>Republic!). For sure he&apos;ll be delighted to learn that from now on, thanks to<br/>Joe Monzo,  people can find information on Haba on the Internet, and perhaps<br/>even listen to some of his music.</p><p>INFORMACNI CENTRUM ALOISE HABY<br/>Ing.
