Care to refute that?</p><p>Schoenberg certainly did construct &apos;4th-chords&apos; that had<br/>9 tones, in which case the ninth &apos;4th&apos; would be very close<br/>to a 5/4 (in a higher octave) above the &apos;root&apos;.  It seems<br/>to me that this would entail exactly the same kind of<br/>equivalences as in your &apos;major 6/9 chord&apos; example.  Actually,<br/>the two different functions in the case of the &apos;4th&apos; chord<br/>are much closer in pitch (only a skhisma [= ~2 cents] apart).</p><p>And as far as your first point goes, one reason Schoenberg<br/>gravitated towards using &apos;4th-chords&apos; is certainly that<br/>he recognized that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale could<br/>be used in a chord before the cycle is closed, which is<br/>*not* true of tertian harmonic practice, where the cycle<br/>is closed after 7 different notes (unless altered and unaltered<br/>chord-members are simultaneously admitted, as they may sometimes<br/>be in jazz).</p><p>During the first decade of this century Schoenberg was<br/>definitely interested in assuming the 12-tone scale in itself<br/>as the tonal basis, rather than the more usual view of<br/>the 7-tone diatonic scale with 5 available alterations.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry Eskelin, TD 459.16]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speaking of Schoenberg, are you familiar with William<br/>&gt; Thompson&apos;s book &quot;Schoenberg&apos;s Error&quot;? Essentially, he<br/>&gt; proposes that Schoenberg appears to have noted the &quot;trend&quot;<br/>&gt; toward atonality and, because he didn&apos;t look back in<br/>&gt; history far enough for a larger perspective, simply jumped<br/>&gt; in front of the parade. His point, of course, is that the<br/>&gt; parade has now largely dissipated.<br/>&gt; (Thank goodness!!!)</p><p>Oh my, what a can of worms you&apos;ve opened now...</p><p>Yes, not only am I familiar with _Schoenberg&apos;s Error_, but<br/>I was already so interested in Schoenberg&apos;s theories (and<br/>music), and found so much wrong with Thomson&apos;s approach,<br/>that I decided when I read it a few years ago that my next<br/>book is going to be a commentary built entirely around<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_, with a lot of arguing against<br/>several points made by Thomson.</p><p>Along these same lines, Daniel Wolf has pointed out that<br/>Martin Vogel has already written a book about Schoenberg<br/>from a very biased JI perspective, _Scho&quot;nberg und die Folgen_.<br/>My German is very limited, but from what I&apos;ve read so far,<br/>I can say that Vogel makes many of the same points I was<br/>going to, but that he doesn&apos;t look broadly enough at the<br/>historical and personal context of Schoenberg&apos;s music and<br/>theories.</p><p>Certainly Thomson is correct that Schoenberg had a very<br/>narrow view of musical history, and the history of music-theory<br/>in particular, and that Schoenberg&apos;s arguments are often<br/>very twisted ways of making his own ideas appear as tho<br/>they&apos;re the logical evolution of past trends in music.<br/>But Thomson bases many of his arguments on premeses that<br/>are common among music-theorists but were *not* held<br/>by Schoenberg himself.</p><p>Those interested in my work on Schoenberg can find some of<br/>the non-technical stuff here:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a></p><p>(BTW, it&apos;s &apos;Thomson&apos; without the &apos;p&apos;.)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

You&apos;re still left with a relatively dissonant diminished<br/>fourth in the former chord, and augmented second in the latter chord. 12-tET<br/>smooths these out nicely.</p><p>&gt;What to call 5-limit systems which exploit the more remote<br/>&gt;lateral lattice connections, such as the use of a 64:75:96<br/>&gt;&apos;minor triad&apos; as in my last posting?</p><p>I haven&apos;t examined your example closely, but my suspicion is that a whole<br/>slew of irrational renditions of this triad would have satisfied you just as<br/>well, and that you&apos;re clinging to low-prime ratios purely for idealogical<br/>reasons.</p><p>&gt;The big surprise to me was that there was such an audible<br/>&gt;difference between 75/64 and 7/6 [= ~8 cents difference],<br/>&gt;more so than between 19/16 and 75/64, which are ~23 cents apart!</p><p>I think this is explained by the fact that 7/6 can be tuned quite accurately<br/>by ear (to within a fraction of a cent) with most timbres; moving up from<br/>there, the next such interval is 6/5, so between 7/6 and 6/5, you pretty<br/>much have an undifferentiated expanse of mildly dissonant intervals. Look at<br/>the harmonic entropy graph in that region.</p><p>&gt;Is 75/64 close enough to some other ratio with larger (but<br/>&gt;not &apos;too&apos; large) prime/odd-factors, that it is emulating it?</p><p>How about smaller odd factors (which is what I think is relevant)? 34/29?<br/>But no, I think you were looking for a qualitative solution, to get<br/>something with a certain &quot;shade of darkness&quot; that Robert Johnson used. I&apos;d<br/>say you&apos;ve gone beyond the realm where any JI theory can help you and you<br/>just have to trust your ears in picking the right cents value. Forget about<br/>ratios.</p><p>You may remember my theory of the minor triad -- it derives its &quot;tonalness&quot;<br/>from the perfect fifth alone, and the minor third is really an &quot;added note&quot;.<br/>Although 6:5 may be the minimum-roughness choice and 19:16 the<br/>maximum-tonalness choice, anything can work (though the character is greatly<br/>affected). I&apos;ve been convinced of that ever since I heard Blackwood&apos;s etude<br/>in &quot;17-tone equal tuning&quot;, where the minor triad is constructed as<br/>282&#xFFFD;+424&#xFFFD;. I love that piece!</p><p>By the way, I was just reading Mathieu&apos;s _Harmonic Experience_, and though<br/>he think we can hear some pretty darn complex ratios in the 5-limit lattice,<br/>he happens to consider 75:64 a &quot;wrongness&quot; (in the context of Mozart).</p></div>
