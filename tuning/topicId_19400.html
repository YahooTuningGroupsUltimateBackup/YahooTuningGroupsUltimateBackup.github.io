I<br/>hope that we can continue this dialogue, at least from time to time,<br/>and would like to express my indebtedness to you in many directions.</p><p>You very successfully communicated to me the contagious urge to tune<br/>22-tET -- and find out how a literal quartertone (1/22 octave) could<br/>serve as a very nice diatonic semitone. I&apos;m tempted to call it a<br/>&quot;tempered 28:27,&quot; maybe revealing my JI/RI streak -- but whatever I<br/>call it, it has a really neat effect, whether in my neo-Gothic<br/>cadences for three or four voices, or just in a melodic improvisation,<br/>maybe with the element of a drone.</p><p>One evening I sat down to improvise in 22-tET, and decided to focus on<br/>the melodic aspect: a drone on D, and a simple melody in the Dorian<br/>mode. That step from major sixth to minor seventh somehow epitomized<br/>the scale for me, something that might have been documented in a paper<br/>on ethnomusicology describing the traditional tuning practices of some<br/>intonationally very wise culture.</p><p>Of course, your tour de force in the Aeolian mode has stuck with me<br/>these several months, a kind legendary exploit in the chronicles of<br/>xenharmonicism.</p><p>The cross-cultural interplay between 22-tET and the 22 srutis of India<br/>is also fascinating to observe; I hope that it enriches musical<br/>perspectives and traditions on all sides.</p><p>While I might have uttered these words on various occasions, your<br/>&quot;change of pace&quot; in accessing this List seems an appropriate moment.</p><p>By the way, I would invite you and everyone to make the most of the<br/>Benedetti material: it&apos;s a fascinating chapter in the history of<br/>consonance/dissonance theory. I&apos;m in agreement that whoever writes<br/>this part of the FAQ should include Benedetti.</p><p>Maybe as a fitting conclusion to this message, I would say that your<br/>writings (and graphics!) have shown the way to fertile valleys and<br/>elevating plateaus of intonational delight.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
