Compensation commensurate with experience,<br/>hopefully none.  Must be free of personal opinions on the subject of<br/>tuning and also be willing to synthesize disparate conflicting<br/>opinions into a coherent solid, inert mass.  FAQ must be &quot;user<br/>friendly&quot; to the absolute beginner, especially to a person who would<br/>have no incentive to search anyplace else but the FAQ.  There should<br/>be no reason that he would search anyplace else, since the FAQ will<br/>have ALL the answers, in readily digestible and distilled form.  FAQ<br/>will &quot;go down easy.&quot;  Hunger for knowledge will be immediately sated.<br/>Additionally, the FAQ has a brain.  This FAQ has been carefully<br/>assembled so that every conceivable question and answer has been<br/>completely formulated.  There is NOTHING but the FAQ and no reason<br/>for unnecessary questions unanswered by the FAQ.  You will learn to<br/>love the FAQ, to live by it and to swear by and at it.  It will be<br/>like life -- expansive, exhaustive, all-encompassing -- your guide to<br/>a coherent and well-integrated State.  Hail FAQ, answerer of our<br/>questions, our guide and inspiration forever!!!</p><p>:)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)</p><p>_______  ___ ---- ...  &gt;&gt; __-----<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
