I want to go crazy seeing so many<br/>people get all sensitive and take offense at things the<br/>wrong way. I&apos;ve stayed out of this so far so I feel I<br/>can make the somewhat objective statement of an outside<br/>observer.</p><p>I think I understood what the original poster meant when<br/>he suggested this as a FAQ topic and let me clarify for<br/>him:</p><p>1. Why Quarter Tones Are Not So Interesting</p><p>Some people coming to microtonality equate the term<br/>microtonality with the quartertone tuning (also known as<br/>24tET, or 50.000cET). Perhaps some teacher in the past who<br/>knew little about alternate tunings gave them this<br/>impression, or maybe they read a misleading article or<br/>album liner notes. You may find yourself saying to someone<br/>&quot;I write microtonal music.&quot; and they respond quite<br/>naturally, &quot;Oh I don&apos;t care for that quarter tone music!&quot;</p><p>Yes, the quarter tone scale is indeed a microtonal scale,<br/>but there are also an infinite number of other great<br/>microtonal scales. Some great music has been written in<br/>the quarter tone scale and maybe you will write some. But<br/>don&apos;t stop there! The Quarter tone scale is not<br/>particularly special or _so_ interesting that it demands<br/>any place of prominence.</p><p>[Perhaps insert comments about how the added resources in<br/>quarter tones don&apos;t have that many particularly<br/>interesting properties.]</p><p>2. Why The Quarter Tone Scale is the only ONE TRUE<br/>MICROTONAL SCALE</p><p>From a _practical_ standpoint, a quarter tone scale might<br/>be the way to go if you are used to performing and writing<br/>for acoustic instruments -- particularly the piano. You<br/>can tune two pianos up a quarter tone apart and have your<br/>compositions performed with four hands. And you still have<br/>a piano that you can play in &apos;normal&apos; 12tET. A lot of<br/>other microtonal scales can not be performed on a standard<br/>acoustic piano because it would put the piano frame under<br/>too much tension. Also, your quarter tone piece can be<br/>performed accompanied by standard unaltered conventional<br/>instruments. These are some of the reasons why quarter<br/>tone music was somewhat popular early in this century and<br/>why for many people it was their only experience with<br/>microtonality, hence the confusion.</p><p>[insert examples of some prominent quarter tone composers]</p><p>3. Why Quarter Tones May Not Be.</p><p>In 12tET terminology, a whole tone is 200 cents, a<br/>semitone 100 cents and a quarter tone 50 cents. But you<br/>will find frequent references to quarter tones that do not<br/>at all mean 50 cents. Perhaps because of the above<br/>discussed confusion, the term &quot;quarter tone&quot; often is used<br/>to mean &quot;any interval smaller than 100 cents&quot; or even &quot;any<br/>interval that is not a multiple of 100 cents&quot;. Don&apos;t add<br/>to the confusion, just be aware of it! If you mean 50<br/>cents, you might want to say it. And if you compose in<br/>&apos;the&apos; quarter tone scale, you might avoid some confusion<br/>by noting that you mean 24tET. You will certainly run into<br/>references like &quot;Arabic Music Uses Quarter Tones&quot;. This<br/>doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that the scale meing discussed is<br/>made up of intervals of 50 cents, or is a subset of 24tET,<br/>though in some cases for certain people it might be!<br/>Sometimes ethnomusicologists have been known to write down<br/>the scales they heard by notating any &apos;in-between&apos; notes<br/>as quarter tones. It doesn&apos;t mean though that the note<br/>they really heard was an actual quarter tone.</p><p>[insert two versions of one example of an Arabic scale -<br/>the 50cET by ear approximation &amp; an accurate empirically<br/>measured version of the same scale]</p><p>[END]</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
