Also the<br/>&gt;11-tone MOS of generator 12...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0 1 3 5 6 8 10 12 13 15 17 19<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;...Both are smaller than the 12-note Yasser chain-of-fifths scale in<br/>&gt;19-tET.</p><p>Good point; the first scale you mention is also strictly proper, so there&apos;s<br/>nothing particularly special about the chromatic scale in this respect.  I<br/>hadn&apos;t looked very closely at the problem.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps the range of a &quot;fifth&quot; is better than most here, but many other<br/>generators do produce proper scales with reasonable number of tones.  And<br/>&gt;the fact that the fifth has been a historically popular generator isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;really explained its utility here, since a given culture usually uses only<br/>&gt;a single scale.  Western music is overwhelmingly diatonic, for example.<br/>&gt;Why not use one of the proper MOSs of the minor third?  And, as you pointed<br/>&gt;out, Rothenberg&apos;s model does not imply that improper scales are &quot;bad&quot;.</p><p>Not &quot;bad&quot; but definitely &quot;bad for a fugue.&quot;  I&apos;m not undertanding your<br/>point on how the fact that a given culture sticks to a single scale applies<br/>here.  If certain scales work better than others given certain other<br/>stylistic traits of the music, then certainly a stylistically coherent<br/>music will often use only one scale, if it significantly better than others<br/>in some respects.  You&apos;re definitely correct, however, that the<br/>characteristics I&apos;m looking at are too weak to explain the use of the 5th<br/>as a generator.</p><p>&gt;I think we must attribute the popularity of the fifth to its strong position<br/>&gt;in the harmonic series, one way or another.  Paul Erlich&apos;s idea of<br/>&gt;tetrachordality as a sort of 2nd-order octave equivalence is one good option.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You also responded to my point that this analysis might explain the use of<br/>&gt;&gt;5ths in the generation of scales in many musical cultures, saying that this<br/>&gt;&gt;fact is better explained by the concordance of the 3/2.  The stumbling<br/>&gt;&gt;block of this latter reasoning (this is not a point of my own invention) is<br/>&gt;&gt;that such scales exist in cultures where harmony doesn&apos;t exist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Octaves exist in such cultures as well.</p><p>You got me there.  I ought to stop slavishly repeating the arguments of<br/>psychologists and think before I try to make a point.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I would agree: I have found that difference tones (a relatively weak<br/>&gt;&gt;phenomenon of harmony) are clearly perceptable in certain melodic<br/>&gt;&gt;situations, rapid sequences of high pitched tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, but I don&apos;t think we need difference tones to explain the 3/2 in<br/>&gt;melody.</p><p>I was unclear here.  Difference tones were just an example of a weak<br/>effect.  Obviously coincidence of partials is a more relevant effect in<br/>harmony which, one could argue, we might percieve between successive tones.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In any case, a stronger point is that many musical systems using fifth-<br/>&gt;&gt;generated scales employ non-harmonic and rapid decay toned idiophones<br/>&gt;&gt;such as xylophone-type instruments, where the consonance of the 3/2 is<br/>&gt;&gt;irrelevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not so sure.  And in fact, my position would be supported if one<br/>&gt;could find evidence that cultures using such instruments subject their<br/>&gt;fifths to greater mis-tuning than cultures using instruments with more<br/>&gt;harmonic timbres.</p><p>I believe you&apos;re probably right that people tend to tune xylophone-type<br/>instruments further from pure in their fifths.  I think this better<br/>supports my point, however: if both the acoustical and Rothenberg-derived<br/>considerations are relevant to differing degrees depending on the musical<br/>situation, then where inharmonic timbres with short decays are used, the<br/>Rothenberg-derived considerations will dominate and there will be no<br/>particular tuning which is heard as pure.  Maybe we actually are<br/>unwittingly in agreement here: I would never want to claim that freq ratios<br/>or the harmonic series are never or rarely musically relevant.</p><p>jason</p></div>
