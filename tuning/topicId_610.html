If we assume that &quot;a<br/>tone&quot; is both 9/8 or 256/243, working whith the rows of fifths, the FIRST TIME that<br/>it appears this -UNICS- interval for two contiguous notes is seven notes. The<br/>pentatonic scale has two m3, the hexatonic has only one m3, and the heptatonic has<br/>their elements (notes) separated to the contiguous  by 9/8 or 256/243.</p><p>Eduardo</p></div>
