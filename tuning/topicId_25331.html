A black-and-white version is in my book now,<br/>but not in the early copy you have.</p><p>I&apos;ve added a color graphic of it to the bottom of my Dictionary<br/>&quot;tonality diamond&quot; entry:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tondiam.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tondiam.htm</a></p><p>It&apos;s an idea I had for a keyboard instrument, back around 1993.<br/>The buttons of the keyboard are arranged in a diamond, and<br/>the 50-cent boundaries between the 12-EDO scale are used to<br/>paint a pattern on the background similar to the usual Halberstadt<br/>pattern of black and white piano keys.</p><p>The pitches of a 19-odd-limit tonality diamond are laid out in<br/>Partch&apos;s diamond format, but arranged so that the otonal and<br/>utonal decads form ascending and descending scales, respectively.<br/>The red lines are otonal and the blue lines are utonal.  The<br/>proportions of the scales are thus 16:17:18:19:(20=10):11:12:13:14:15.</p><p>And (close to what Paul states) the horizontal axis represents<br/>pitch-height exactly, so that a vertical column of buttons,<br/>viewed against the background of either a white or black &quot;key&quot;,<br/>gives a precise view of all the different versions of any given<br/>12-EDO pitch-class.</p><p>For example, looking down the row of buttons over the black<br/>&quot;C#/Db key&quot; next to &quot;middle-C&quot;, from top to bottom, one can see:</p><p>15/14 = the 15-odentity of 8/7-otonality and<br/>        the 7-udentity of 15/8-utonality,</p><p>14/13 = the 7-odentity of 16/13-otonality and<br/>        the 13-udentity of 7/4-utonality,</p><p>13/12 = the 13-odentity of 4/3-otonality and<br/>        the 3-udentity of 13/8-utonality,</p><p>12/11 = the 3-odentity of 16/11-otonality and<br/>        the 11-udentity of 3/2-utonality,</p><p>20/19 = the 5-odentity of 32/19-otonality and<br/>        the 19-udentity of 5/4-utonality,</p><p>19/18 = the 19-odentity of 16/9-otonality and<br/>        the 9-udentity of 19/16-utonality,</p><p>18/17 = the 9-odentity of 32/17-otonality and<br/>        the 17-udentity of 9/8-utonality, and</p><p>17/16 = the 17-odentity of 1/1-otonality and<br/>        the 1-identity of 17/16-utonality,</p><p>and finally, if we look over at the lone C#/Db in<br/>the lower 2:1 (&quot;octave&quot;) of the keyboard, we see:</p><p>16/15 = the 1-odentity of 16/15-otonality and<br/>        the 15-udentity of 1/1-utonality.</p><p>This gives a nice graphical presentation of all the<br/>different pitches falling between 0.50 and 1.50 Semitones<br/>(or 50 and 150 cents), which would have the following<br/>values in my 72-EDO-based HEWM notation, C = n^0 ,<br/>with the following meaning for accidentals:</p><p>^  + 1/4-tone<br/>&gt;  + 1/6-tone<br/>+  + 1/12-tone<br/>0<br/>-  - 1/12-tone<br/>&lt;  - 1/6-tone<br/>v  - 1/4-tone</p><p>Semitones ratio  HEWM prime-factor   prime-factor vector<br/>                                     3  5  7 11 13 17 19</p><p>  0.89    20/19  Db- 5^1 19^-1     | 0  1  0  0  0  0 -1|<br/>  0.94    19/18  C# 3^-2 19^1      |-2  0  0  0  0  0  1|<br/>  0.99    18/17  C# 3^2 17^-1      | 2  0  0  0  0 -1  0|<br/>  1.05    17/16  Db 17^-1          | 0  0  0  0  0 -1  0|<br/>  1.12    16/15  Db+ 3^-1 5^-1     |-1 -1  0  0  0  0  0|<br/>  1.19    15/14  C#+ 3^1 5^1 7^-1  | 1  1 -1  0  0  0  0|<br/>  1.28    14/13  Db&gt; 7^1 13^-1     | 0  0  1  0 -1  0  0|<br/>  1.39    13/12  Db&gt;  3^-1 13^1    |-1  0  0  0  1  0  0|<br/>  1.51    12/11  Dv 3^1 11^-1      | 1  0  0 -1  0  0  0|</p><p>And so on for all the other &quot;black and white keys&quot;.<br/>The only &quot;key&quot; or pitch-class having only one pitch<br/>is C = n^0.</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=25365 href="#25365">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2001 12:33:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve added a color graphic of it to the bottom of my Dictionary<br/>&gt; &quot;tonality diamond&quot; entry:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tondiam.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tondiam.htm</a></p><p>Ouch -- after 10 minutes not even half of this loaded, and I have a<br/>T1 connection!</p><p>My recommendation is to lose the 72-tET notation for the 19-limit<br/>diamond -- 72-tET is not consistent in the 19-limit.</p><p>And I&apos;m pretty sure you showed me a similar graph for the 11-limit<br/>diamond at some point.</p></div>
