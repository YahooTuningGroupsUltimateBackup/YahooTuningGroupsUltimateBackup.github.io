In my experience,<br/>the wider interval will certainly be more painful, unless it<br/>approaches another simple interval like 9:7. That would happen if the<br/>lower note is around 350 Hz. Two octaves up from there, the equal-<br/>tempered major third beats at 55.55 hertz. In such a fairly normal<br/>register, are you suggesting that in slowly narrowing the equal-<br/>tempered major third to a just one, the dissonance will actually<br/>increase for a while, before it begins to decrease???</p><p>Are you basing it on Helmholtz? Helmholtz&apos;s theory of sensory<br/>dissonance had been pretty much replaced by the Plomp/Sethares<br/>theory, which ties roughness to critical band overlap and not to the<br/>(necessarily cophenomenal) beating. Critical bandwidth, in cents, is<br/>a mildly varying function of register, while beat rates increase<br/>exponentially with register (linearly with frequency). While tying<br/>dissonance to beat rates would suggest that the cents deviation of<br/>the worst mistuning of an interval would halve with every<br/>transposition up an octave, experience suggests (and the critical<br/>band theory explains) that the dependence of relative dissonance on<br/>register is milder.</p><p>Also, beyond this so-called &quot;sensory dissonance&quot; is another<br/>component, the one focused on in Parncutt&apos;s work, which I like to<br/>call &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; -- a very real component of dissonance<br/>reflecting the brain&apos;s ability to fit the stimulus into the pattern<br/>of a single harmonic series.

Would your concern reach into such a small range?</p><p>My comment really might better have been phrased as a question about<br/>psychoacoustics, and that is why I gave it a new subject heading.  Maybe it<br/>is even so fundamental as to be the question, &quot;what is dissonance, really?&quot;<br/> I can record the &apos;pain&apos; on faces in the audience if I play a chord which<br/>(because of a failing reed on my harmonica) has a distinctly detuned fifth,<br/>or (on a chromatic harmonica which has side-by-side unisons) a unison that<br/>beats blat-blat-blat at some 5-10 times a second.  Ugly.  But a slow roll<br/>at 1-2 cycles per second?  That can sound even musical, arguably better at<br/>times than matched frequencies.</p><p>You ask if my concern extends into the &lt;10 cents range. At 440 cps, unisons<br/>differing by one cent will roll at one cycle every 3.9 seconds, while 880<br/>cps unisons will roll twice as fast.  A difference of 10 cents represents<br/>beat rates exactly ten times as fast at either pitch -- for the 440 cps A,<br/>that is 2.55 beats per second and 5.6 bps at 880.  These are low beat<br/>rates, so it is a good question you ask, whether my concern about the<br/>nonlinearity (lack of monotonicity) of the &apos;pain&apos; experience extends into<br/>the &lt;10 cents range.</p><p>I think it may, not so much because of beating, but rather, because of<br/>combination tones, particularly, difference tones.  I consider much of the<br/>sonority of just intervals to be from difference tones that are in tune<br/>with, or in perfect harmony with, the two or three notes being played.<br/>Because they are generally low, they act almost like pedal point to the<br/>chord.  So for a just-tuned (5/4) M3rd (A=440, C# = 550), there is a<br/>difference tone at 110 that is a very low A.  If the C# is just two cents<br/>sharp (C# = 550.6357521), then the difference tone is at 110.6357521 cps.<br/>Because of the low pitch, this represents a full 10 cents divergence from<br/>110!  If the original M3rd is 10 cents wide, then the difference tone is<br/>inaccurate by a full 50 cents!  That, by the way, sounds hideous if the<br/>acoustics in any way accentuate difference tones, as they often do for me.</p><p>I realize that the last thing you need in your algorithm is some baroque<br/>mathematical formulation for a pain index by which to adjust (relax?) a<br/>tuning.  Except for the problem with combination tones, I&apos;d say your<br/>square-of-the-distance penalty should be OK for +/- 10 cents.</p><p>Yours truly,</p></div><h3><a id=10134 href="#10134">ðŸ”—</a>John Thaden &#x3C;jjthaden@flash.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2000 1:05:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote<br/>&gt;&gt; As an example, a wide M3rd that beats at 10-20 cps<br/>&gt;&gt; might be more painful to listen to than an even wider<br/>&gt;&gt; one that beats at 50 hertz.</p><p>And Paul Erlich asked<br/>&gt;John, are you basing this on personal experience?

But if my experience<br/>were fundamentally wrong, then I &#x9;question whether a 5:4 M3rd -- say that<br/>represented by 350 and 437.5 Hz, to borrow from your example -- would be<br/>pleasant, given that the respective 9th and 7th harmonics are beating away<br/>at a merry 87.5 Hz, and the 8th and 6th at 175!  Clearly some beating is<br/>objectionable and some less so, and faster is not necessarily worse.<br/>(Another example, perhaps cooked, of nonmonotonic dissonance is afforded by<br/>echo harmonicas and some electronic organs, where unisons are detuned for<br/>the sake of a tremolo.  With the former, we can tune the unison through<br/>embouchure to match the beat rate to the pulse of the song, when it will be<br/>perceived as more pleasing than a more &apos;in-tune&apos; unison with slower tremolo<br/>not fitting the song.)</p><p>&gt;Are you basing it on Helmholtz?

I&apos;d like to read about the critical bandwidth idea and would be<br/>grateful for a reference to the Plomp-Sethares.  I agree that the<br/>dependence of relative dissonance on register does seem milder (though<br/>still present) than what would result from the existence of a fixed range<br/>of &apos;most objectionable&apos; beat rates, but would be the expectation if the<br/>objectionable range is itself dependent upon the pitch at which the beating<br/>is heard.</p><p>&gt;Also, beyond this so-called &quot;sensory dissonance&quot; is another<br/>&gt;component, the one focused on in Parncutt&apos;s work, which I like to<br/>&gt;call &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; -- a very real component of dissonance<br/>&gt;reflecting the brain&apos;s ability to fit the stimulus into the pattern<br/>&gt;of a single harmonic series.

Back to the M3rd example with base pitch 350 Hz.  As<br/>the 3rd is widened from 437.5 Hz (the 5:4) to 450 (the 9:7), when does<br/>one&apos;s mind know to stop attending to the accelerating beats at 1750 Hz (the<br/>5:4) and start attending to the slowing beats at 3150 Hz (the 9:7)?<br/>Perhaps when the former become fast enough to fade from notice.  It is this<br/>shifting of attention that interests me, and call it a feature of harmonic<br/>entropy, or simple discomfort with beating within a certain frequency<br/>range, both are consistent with a preference for simple ratios.

As<br/>&gt;the 3rd is widened from 437.5 Hz (the 5:4) to 450 (the 9:7), when does<br/>&gt;one&apos;s mind know to stop attending to the accelerating beats at 1750 Hz (the<br/>&gt;5:4) and start attending to the slowing beats at 3150 Hz (the 9:7)?<br/>&gt;Perhaps when the former become fast enough to fade from notice.  It is this<br/>&gt;shifting of attention that interests me, and call it a feature of harmonic<br/>&gt;entropy, or simple discomfort with beating within a certain frequency<br/>&gt;range, both are consistent with a preference for simple ratios.  What might<br/>&gt;be expected to differ, and therefore be testable, is the shape of the<br/>&gt;&apos;pain&apos; function in between two simple ratios, even if the space between is<br/>&gt;too small to permit consonance islands other than simple ratios.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in all this too, but how would you account for my initial<br/>observation, that even though the 12-tET major third at 1400 Hz beats at<br/>55.55 Hz, you don&apos;t get anything but a smooth increase in consonance as you<br/>narrow the interval down to a just major third?</p><p>&gt;But a slow roll<br/>&gt;at 1-2 cycles per second?  That can sound even musical, arguably better at<br/>&gt;times than matched frequencies.</p><p>Thankfully, John deLaubenfels often (usually/) runs his programs not to<br/>obtain adaptive JI, but rather adaptive _tuning_: the tradeoffs between<br/>retune motion and JI deviation are never fully decided one way or the other,<br/>and a very slight deviation from JI is the result for most chords.</p><p>&gt;You ask if my concern extends into the &lt;10 cents range. At 440 cps, unisons<br/>&gt;differing by one cent will roll at one cycle every 3.9 seconds, while 880<br/>&gt;cps unisons will roll twice as fast.  A difference of 10 cents represents<br/>&gt;beat rates exactly ten times as fast at either pitch -- for the 440 cps A,<br/>&gt;that is 2.55 beats per second and 5.6 bps at 880.  These are low beat<br/>&gt;rates, so it is a good question you ask, whether my concern about the<br/>&gt;nonlinearity (lack of monotonicity) of the &apos;pain&apos; experience extends into<br/>&gt;the &lt;10 cents range.</p><p>But for intervals like 6:5 in the same registers, the beat rates associated<br/>with a 10-cent mistuning will be 5 or 6 times as fast.</p><p>&gt;I think it may, not so much because of beating, but rather, because of<br/>&gt;combination tones, particularly, difference tones.  I consider much of the<br/>&gt;sonority of just intervals to be from difference tones that are in tune<br/>&gt;with, or in perfect harmony with, the two or three notes being played.</p><p>Aha! You didn&apos;t say so before. Modeling these would be tough, since one<br/>would need to know the exact volume with which the music reached the<br/>listener&apos;s ears, as the volumes of the difference tones are very sensitive<br/>non-linear functions of the volumes of the objective tones.</p><p>&gt;I realize that the last thing you need in your algorithm is some baroque<br/>&gt;mathematical formulation for a pain index by which to adjust (relax?) a<br/>&gt;tuning.  Except for the problem with combination tones, I&apos;d say your<br/>&gt;square-of-the-distance penalty should be OK for +/- 10 cents.</p><p>Agreed!</p></div><h3><a id=10143 href="#10143">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I have just a couple of quick comments.</p><p>I&apos;ve given some thought to modeling difference tones and their out-of-<br/>tuneness against other difference tones and other actual notes.  In<br/>chords of three or more notes, doing so in effect tightens the tuning<br/>requirements and creates &quot;springs&quot; that tie together several notes, a<br/>modeling headache but certainly possible, especially given successive<br/>relaxation toward a minimum energy (&quot;pain&quot;) state.</p><p>In regard to the potential benefits of slight deviation from exact JI,<br/>Paul is correct that I &quot;often (usually/)&quot; do this.  In fact, since the<br/>spring model early this year, I ALWAYS do this, trading nearness to JI<br/>against reduced tuning motion.  For people like Carl Lumma, who desire<br/>exact vertical JI, I have in mind changes to the program that would<br/>allow the benefits of springs for drift control but still allow<br/>infinitely rigid vertical tuning, but haven&apos;t programmed them yet (the<br/>challenge is that the successive relaxation I&apos;m now doing fails when<br/>rigid springs are mixed with non-rigid ones; the solution is more<br/>sophisticated relaxation techniques - sorry to keep you waiting, Carl!).</p><p>John and Paul, thanks for your posts!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
