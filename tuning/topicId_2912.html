But then again, as they agree with nearly nothing you say...<br/>perhaps they really don&apos;t address the point?</p><p>Dan</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt;No ET can be tuned by ear which shows its own absurdity.

Nature has bigger things than even-vibration-ratios for man to learn<br/>how to use. Consonance is a relative thing (just a nice name for a nice<br/>habit). It is a natural enough part of music, but not the whole, or the<br/>only one. The simplest ratios, often called perfect consonances, have been<br/>used for so long and so constantly that not only music, but also musicians<br/>and audiences, have become more or less soft. If they hear anything but<br/>do-me-soh or a near cousin, they have to be carried out on a stretcher.&quot;</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Kraig Grady:]<br/>&gt;Then do it, measure the results and let me know! The proof is in the<br/>pudding.</p><p>I&apos;ve never had to tune an equal temperament by ear... And the point from my<br/>perspective is that this is (as both a musician and a composer) a non-issue<br/>(for me). [A bad analogy might be something on the order of saying: &quot;Lets<br/>see you fly without an airplane...&quot;] In short, whether I can or I can&apos;t<br/>tune an equal temperament by ear is really besides the point in the context<br/>of my actual musical doings... But keeping the discussion strictly in the<br/>&apos;tuning by ear&apos; context of which you wrote; you seem to be saying that<br/>every fraction of an octave has a suitable JI representation that is<br/>(easily?) tunable by the ear alone...? (&quot;No ET can be tuned by ear which<br/>shows its own absurdity. This becomes really apparent once one has worked<br/>with the just intervals it approximates.&quot;) But to what degree is this<br/>really the case? Are 3/5ths &amp; 4/7ths of an octave really nothing more than<br/>illegitimate 3/2&apos;s? Regardless of whether or not you happen to believe (as<br/>I do) that the equal division of the octave is a legitimate tuning entity<br/>outside of the _one-dimensional_, &apos;historical expedience&apos; role in which it<br/>is often cast;I really don&apos;t think you would have to look very hard, or<br/>far, to find many examples along these lines.</p><p>Are simple JI intervals easier to tune by ear than fractions of an octave?<br/>Of course! Is this desirable and useful? Absolutely. Are these the<br/>chief/only concerns of tuning and intonation......</p><p>Dan</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Kraig Grady:]<br/>&gt;frankly a while back I listed Why I preferred JI over ET. I expected to<br/>get a list back.</p><p>Well if you expected a list of why I prefer ET over JI, I wouldn&apos;t have one<br/>to give back;- as I don&apos;t...</p><p>FERTILE FIELDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS?<br/>Before I was aware of even fairly common terms like microtone or<br/>quartertone, and in what I believe to be a natural process of<br/>musical/creative curiosity and experimentation, I was drawn to various<br/>attempts at manipulating, regulating, and aligning intonation.* (It would<br/>actually take several years before it ever really sunk in that there were<br/>many formal systematized ways to go about this...) When I did eventually<br/>settle into using (almost exclusively) intonation and tuning scenarios and<br/>methods that weren&apos;t the octave divided into twelve equal parts; I did so<br/>because I was utterly fascinated by both the immediate usefulness, and the<br/>latent possibilities of such a vastly expanded expressive and structural<br/>resource... And some fourteen or so years on, I have honestly yet to<br/>encounter a single tuning scenario that doesn&apos;t seem to (either by way of<br/>its particular or general usefulness) &apos;LIKE MUSIC...&apos; Clouds of beats/no<br/>beats, no fifths/all fifths, melodic commas/harmonic commas... the good the<br/>bad and the neutral - Fertile fields in all directions...**</p><p>When I first started looking into what &apos;microtonal&apos; literature I could (A)<br/>find, and (B) have even the remotest chance of understanding... three<br/>things seemed to jump right out at me: (1) The theoretical and technical<br/>scope was immense, _extremely_ daunting, and could probably prove to be<br/>just as alluring as the actual sounds themselves... (2) Until the<br/>widespread advent of the Internet, you probably had to windup quite outside<br/>the readily available channels*** to acquire much more than a misunderstood<br/>misrepresentation of Harry Partch and quartertones... and (3) From the<br/>&quot;trista&quot;**** of Hermann Helmholtz&apos; classic &quot;On the Sensation of Tone,&quot; to<br/>the red meat, processed sugars, and violent action movies***** of Kyle<br/>Gann&apos;s contemporary &quot;Just Intonation Explained&quot; -- my personal awe and<br/>admiration of an undiminished pitch continuum (where all the possible<br/>structural and emotional resources one could find and make useful were as<br/>such _fundamentally_ useful******) seemed to be standing in direct<br/>opposition to the oft repeated ideological equilibrium&apos;s of just<br/>intonation.</p><p>In his introduction to the 1954 edition of &quot;On The Sensation Of Tone,&quot;<br/>Henry Margenau would write: &quot;...and the musician finds in it unexhausted<br/>treasure if he wishes to understand his art...&quot; While I certainly believe<br/>that he got the unexhausted treasure part right(!), I also believe that the<br/>indicative &quot;IF&quot; of an &quot;if he wishes to understand his art,&quot;******* has<br/>fostered not only the careful and considered &apos;high accountabilities&apos; of<br/>physiological literatim (et al...), but also a host of axiomatic<br/>perorations that to this day comprise a sizable portion of the<br/>tuning/intonation narrative.</p><p>Dan</p><p>*Anyone who might be interested in hearing a specific audio example of<br/>these types of &quot;various attempts at manipulating, regulating, and aligning<br/>intonation,&quot; can see Silvered.ram/.rm, or Blue Caro.ram/.rm @ Jeff<br/>Collins&apos;: <a href="http://members.xoom.com/Minor2nd/">http://members.xoom.com/Minor2nd/</a></p><p>**Though it should go without saying - Just because I personally happen to<br/>have been open and receptive to all these different types of tuning<br/>possibilities, that is in no way meant to imply that I believe my music to<br/>be any better off than that created out of the most excluding and<br/>uncontestable &apos;way it is&apos; intonational view. That said: When it comes to<br/>the strictly quantifiable structural components of music, I really can&apos;t<br/>see any (reasonable) reason why [regardless of whether I personally happen<br/>to find any use for it or not] a potentially useful method/tool [&quot;Natural,<br/>reasonable, and inherently pleasing&quot; - or not/&quot;Easy, convenient, and<br/>without logical aural causation&quot; - or not] wouldn&apos;t-shouldn&apos;t-couldn&apos;t<br/>potentially be put to good _OR BETTER_ (&apos;musical&apos;) use by someone (/else)<br/>somewhere (/else).</p><p>***Even those frequented by someone with a natural curiosity (if not a<br/>&apos;natural&apos; technical orientation) for such things.</p><p>****pg. 230 [Helmholtz, &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;]</p><p>*****The actual quote from Kyle Gann&apos;s &quot;Just Intonation Explained&quot; @:<br/><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/tuning.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/tuning.html</a> is... &quot;Equal temperament could<br/>be described as the musical equivalent to eating a lot of red meat and<br/>processed sugars and watching violent action films.&quot;</p><p>******Which of course is neither some sort of artistic carte blanche, or<br/>some righteous character contingency.
