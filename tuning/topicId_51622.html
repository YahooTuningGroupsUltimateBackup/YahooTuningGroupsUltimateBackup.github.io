It is just *too much* dense material to get through<br/>in those signature.</p><p>However, I also want to say that there are some gems in there.</p><p>Therefore what I suggest is to simply *shorten* them, and include only a<br/>single gem in a given email, so that you can help us all create a reasonable<br/>balance in what we receive.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
