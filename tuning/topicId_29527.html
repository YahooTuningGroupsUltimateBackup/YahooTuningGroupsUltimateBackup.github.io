Our story today brings out the bells. A carillon is a<br/>&gt; collection of tuned bells arranged so they may be played as if they<br/>&gt; were the strings of some piano or organ. The bells are hung in a<br/>&gt; stationary manner and the clappers are connected to a mechanical<br/>&gt; keyboard played with fists and feet. Expert playing requires musical<br/>&gt; dexterity, strength and endurance -- an art form that is rarely seen<br/>&gt; and slowly but surely disappearing from the planet. The bells and the<br/>&gt; mechanism to play the bells often weigh several tons and are normally<br/>&gt; stashed away in some bell tower to be heard and not seen. We were<br/>&gt; recently treated to a wonderful performance in the open air and at<br/>&gt; ground level of a carillon at the Texas Renaissance Festival. The<br/>&gt; act, called &quot;Cast in Bronze&quot; was inspirational. <a href="http://castinbronze.com">castinbronze.com</a> will<br/>&gt; give you some additional information.<br/>&gt; ................<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p><p>Bell ringing is alive and well in the UK, especially England where it is something of an esoteric<br/>cult.
