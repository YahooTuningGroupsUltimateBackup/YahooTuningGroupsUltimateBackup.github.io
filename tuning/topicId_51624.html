However, it is more akin to a fretless string<br/>&gt;instrument in that it doesn&apos;t have discrete pitches.<br/>&gt;&quot;Any pitch may be played,&quot; said Haken, adding that the dynamics of the<br/>&gt;sound are controlled by finger pressure. &quot;The front-to-back position of<br/>&gt;each finger affects timbre.&quot; Vibrato can be achieved by wiggling a finger<br/>&gt;on a particular spot on the instrument&apos;s surface, and glissando -- a smooth<br/>&gt;transition from one note to another -- also is possible.<br/>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve been interested in sound morphing for a long time,&quot; said the inventor,<br/>&gt;who hopes his instrument might be embraced by musicians and composers who<br/>&gt;create computer-generated music for a multitude of purposes -- from<br/>advertising<br/>&gt;to film scores. &quot;But I especially want to see it in live concert,&quot; said<br/>&gt;Haken, a lifelong fan of live music who knows his own way around a viola<br/>&gt;but humbly insists, &quot;I play best with the door closed.&quot;<br/>&gt;It may be a while before vast numbers of musicians start beating down Haken&apos;s<br/>&gt;door to acquire the continuum fingerboard. So far, only five full-sized<br/>&gt;models and two half-sized models have been manufactured.<br/>&gt;And Haken is the first to admit that his invention may not be the easiest<br/>&gt;instrument to learn to play. In part, that&apos;s because it doesn&apos;t have keys<br/>&gt;or other indicators to assist the musician in determining finger placement.<br/>&gt;The flat playing surface consists of a soft, red fabric that covers the<br/>&gt;mechanics of the instrument -- 256 rods, 5.75 inches long, mounted on<br/>piano-wire<br/>&gt;springs.<br/>&gt;&quot;The rods are covered by cloth so that the performer has the impression<br/>&gt;of a continuous surface rather than discrete keys,&quot; Haken said. &quot;A magnet<br/>&gt;is mounted at both ends of each rod, and the rods are placed between two<br/>&gt;rows of Hall-effect sensors.&quot; The sensors measure the positions of the<br/>&gt;magnets, and when the performer applies pressure, rods under the finger<br/>&gt;are depressed and the magnets on those rods move closer to the sensors.<br/>&gt;Scanning software running on the instrument&apos;s internal computer then detects<br/>&gt;fingers by looking for any bar that has normalized sensor values greater<br/>&gt;than both of its neighboring bars.<br/>&gt;-mm-</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist<br/>&quot;Space is a practiced place.&quot; -- Michel de Certeau<br/>&quot;Space is the Place for the Human Race.&quot; -- William S. Burroughs</p><p>&quot;... simple, chaotic, anarchic and menacing.... This is what people of today<br/>have lost and need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily and<br/>mental ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from<br/>other worlds and nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which<br/>come in static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko<br/>(Donald L. Philippi)</p><p>    The German word for &quot;noise&quot; _Ger&auml;usch_ is derived from _rauschen_ &quot;the<br/>sound of the wind,&quot; related to _Rausch_ &quot;ecstasy, intoxication&quot; hinting at some<br/>of the possible aesthetic, bodily effects of noise in music. In Japanese<br/>Romaji: _uchu_ = &quot;universe&quot;... _uchoten_ =  &quot;ecstasty,&quot; &quot;rapture&quot;..._uchujin_ =<br/>[space] alien!</p><p>&quot;When you&apos;re trying to do something you should feel absolutely alone, like a<br/>spark in the blackness of the universe.&quot;-Xenakis</p><p>    &quot;For twenty-five centuries, Western knowledge has tried to look upon the<br/>world. It has failed to understand that the world is not for the beholding. It<br/>is for the hearing. It is not legible, but audible. ... Music is a herald,<br/>for change is inscribed in noise faster than it transforms society. ...<br/>Listening to music is listening to all noise, realizing that its appropriation and<br/>control is a reflection of power, that is essentially political.&quot; - Jacques<br/>Attali, _Noise: The Political Economy of Music_</p><p>    &quot;The sky and its stars make music in you.&quot; - Dendera, Egypt wall<br/>inscription</p><p>&quot;Sound as an isolated object of reproduction, call it our collective memory<br/>bank...
