It&apos;s just that 9-tET is a very easy tuning to<br/>play around with on a standard keyboard and one can modulate and also use<br/>the very convincing-sounding symmetrical hexatonic scale.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/1999 5:41:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul!<br/>    Wilson would not suggest the use of an equal temperment for either pelog or<br/>slendro. nor would he suggest a just solution. He has pointed out that these<br/>tunings if you face them head on avoid both. He has done some extensive work on<br/>these which awaits some polishing before he goes public. That certain pelogs<br/>could be extended to 9,16, &amp; 23 tones he has suggested as a possibly but has<br/>observed pelogs that cycle through other cycles 13, or 14 for that matter.<br/>Possibly pelog includes a family of scales. Kunst got the idea &quot;blown fifths&quot;<br/>from Hornbostel but there is neither evidence of tubes being used by tuners nor<br/>actual measurements that match in any convincing way. It is all too common for<br/>cultural artifacts from around the world to be placed in a western reference<br/>even when it doesn&apos;t apply. If another culture mentions a flood there are those<br/>who start talking about arks! I&apos;m back but i don&apos;t know for how long.</p><p>&quot;Paul H.
