The classical approach, now in<br/>vogue, is certainly valid...but, it is also getting extremely boring; as<br/>boring as it would be to go into an art museum, and see dozens of<br/>paintings based on the Mona Lisa. Your comment makes me see how much my<br/>focus in art is the strikingly original, the surprising, the<br/>innovative...I have always been that way, and that approach is a primary<br/>reason I am so taken by the field of tuning. It allows untold ways to be<br/>fresh and creative...providing, of course, essential musical skills are<br/>also present. I don&apos;t like to see any art form worship it&apos;s past, as is<br/>happening in jazz (and just about every other form of music, except<br/>rap...and, I expect they&apos;ll do it, too, as soon as the form gets old<br/>enough to have a tradition). The past is to learn from, and then build<br/>on...fossils are interesting artifacts, but no longer living and<br/>growing.<br/>    To me, the lesson of the maestros is to BE like them, not copy what<br/>they did. There&apos;s something about an original work of art that is<br/>awesome to me...to do that which has never been done is the crowning<br/>achievement of art, or life itself. And, the absolute hardest thing to<br/>do, as evidenced by the scarcity of originals, and the preponderance of<br/>mimics. The reason I like Dan Stearn&apos;s music so much is that he shows me<br/>worlds I never knew existed...I wish more folks could do the<br/>same...Hstick</p></div>
