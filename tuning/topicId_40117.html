I was thinking<br/>of the 53-note Pythagorean &quot;loop&quot; that Margo has been discussing. (I<br/>happened to come up with that &quot;loopy&quot; term, myself, and almost forgot<br/>about it!)</p><p>I guess I tend to think of a Pythagorean loop as something *pure*,<br/>maybe from reading some of Margo&apos;s essays on Medieval music... so<br/>53edo was not so much on my mind.</p><p>I&apos;m assuming you call it an EDO rather than an ET because what<br/>it&apos;s &quot;tempering&quot; is rather vague (with all the different<br/>possibilities??)</p><p>&gt; the reason why 53edo is so good at approximating Pythagorean tuning<br/>&gt; is because of Mercator&apos;s comma, which is a ratio with hideously<br/>large numbers which i prefer to write simply as 3^53, and it&apos;s about<br/>&gt; 3.615045866 cents.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Is this the &quot;map cat&quot; or somebody related to him??</p><p>&gt; what this means is that when constructing a Pythagorean chain,<br/>&gt; one will first encounter the Pythagorean comma (~23.46 cents)<br/>&gt; at 3^12, then if the chain is carried out farther, the next<br/>&gt; note you&apos;ll find which is closer to the 1/1 is 3^53, only<br/>&gt; ~3.6 cents away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so in the same way that 12edo can be viewed as a 1/12-Pythagorean-<br/>comma<br/>&gt; temperament, 53edo can be viewed as a 1/53-Mercator-comma<br/>temperament.<br/>&gt; each &quot;5th&quot; is narrowed by 1/53 of a Mercator-comma, so that when<br/>&gt; you reach the 53rd one, the ~3.6 cents has vanished and you&apos;re<br/>&gt; exactly back where you started from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now, 1/53 of a Mercator-comma is only ~0.068208413 cent<br/>&gt; (about 1/15-cent), so a &quot;5th&quot; tempered by that tiny amount<br/>&gt; really isn&apos;t all that different from a &quot;pure&quot; 3:2.  thus,<br/>&gt; 53edo&apos;s excellence in approximating Pythagorean tuning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I&apos;d hate to try to tune that on my old piano.... :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; as far as emulating 5-limit JI, 53edo&apos;s &quot;major-3rd&quot; comes<br/>&gt; in both the Pythagorean and JI flavors.  if we think of the<br/>&gt; 53edo &quot;5th&quot; as our generator, +4 generators gives us the<br/>&gt; pseudo-Pythagorean &quot;major-3rd&quot; resembling 81:64, and<br/>&gt; -8 generators gives us the schismic and pseudo-JI &quot;major 3rd&quot;<br/>&gt; resembling 5:4.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Oh sure... so this is the E-G# third that Lindley was discussing<br/>and that, quite possibly, led to further 5-limit developments of the<br/>Renaissance.  (I *think* that was the spelling...)</p><p>&gt; the 53edo schismic 3rd is ~384.9056604 cents, which is<br/>&gt; only ~1.408053487 cents narrower than the 5:4 ratio.<br/>&gt; so you see that it also represents 5-limit extremely well,<br/>&gt; altho not nearly as perfectly as it does Pythagorean.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***It&apos;s great to have a scale that does *both* of those...</p><p>Thanks, Monz!</p><p>Joe P.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2002 9:42:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;tuning@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, October 25, 2002 8:53 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: review of 53-tET<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this was all figured out centuries ago in China.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (and of course, i&apos;d bet that the Chinese got it somehow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the Sumerians.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the chinese never looked at the 5-limit or higher, as they<br/>were<br/>&gt; &gt; strictly . . . what we in the west would call &quot;pythagorean&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hmmm ... really?  even the theorists never even bothered<br/>&gt; to look at 5-limit?  i&apos;m surprised if that&apos;s true.</p><p>it&apos;s true that 53-equal was proposed from only a 3-limit basis in<br/>all the published references i&apos;ve ever read about chinese<br/>musical theory.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2002 9:45:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Oh sure... so this is the E-G# third that Lindley was<br/>discussing<br/>&gt; and that, quite possibly, led to further 5-limit developments of<br/>the<br/>&gt; Renaissance.
