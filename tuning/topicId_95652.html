A surprising aspect of the guitar was how easy it was to adapt to 17 equal fingering. With some adjustments I can play 12 equal equivalents Â– and of course do more.</p><p>About two thirds through you will hear me switch from neck to bridge pickup. I particularly like how clear the full barr hammer ons came out at the end. As far as tuning the guitar Â– I tuned it as it is were a 12 equal guitar except I used the 7th fret Â– and 6th fret for the &quot;B&quot; string.</p><p>Download<br/><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/17-noodles.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/17-noodles.mp3</a></p><p>Online play<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=436">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=436</a></p></div><h3><a id=95653 href="#95653">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2011 6:44:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>That&apos;s really cool!

Yep - the 494 fourth is what I used excepting the 424 &quot;major&quot; third</p><p>2. Fingerings - I observe the following</p><p>Octaves and 5ths are dead simple - instead of skipping 1 fret you skip 2<br/>frets.<br/>4ths are the barr - obviously from the open tuning</p><p>the following is acceptable to me</p><p>An E major - same shape just push the fretted notes up one fret.<br/>An A major - same shape - just up one fret<br/>An open G major - stops on 4th and 3rd fret. - looks the same<br/>A D major is pushing it to my ears (up one fret) works better if you remove<br/>the 3rd - D sus is fine.<br/>A minor - up one fret - not so good.<br/>An open E minor is right on the edge for me - stops on 3rd fret</p><p>I was favoring a 282 minor 3rd. I used this in parallel a lot:</p><p>open e, open g, open b strings - then fingering that at different frets.<br/>So... it is an root, minor 10th, and 12th used in Debussian fashion as a<br/>parallel color.<br/>And that was the chord progression I favored in the improvisation we are<br/>discussing.</p><p>Thank you for the listen, comments, and even more the questions!</p><p>Take care,</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Tue, Jan 18, 2011 at 9:44 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s really cool!

You don&apos;t even have to spread your<br/>fingers differently: The string still has to be fretted around the<br/>same point in order to give a fourth, fifth, etc, right? The only<br/>question is precisely where the fret stops the string.</p><p>The big variable -- and the reason Chris&apos;s open Em forms didn&apos;t sound<br/>so hot -- is what&apos;s considered a fourth. In 17 EDO they&apos;re only 494<br/>cents, which drives the G string down to an (octave-reduced) 282-cent<br/>interval. (A standard guitar is tuned EADGBE, low to high, so the G<br/>string is three fourths higher than the bass E. Also, because E is<br/>lowest, I tend to think of everything relative to E, and all cents<br/>references here are determined that way.)</p><p>I made a spreadsheet that would let me play with different EDOs. 19<br/>would make a very playable guitar, I think; the slightly sharp fourth<br/>(505.3 cents) puts the G string at a perfectly tuned G (316 cents).<br/>The other chord forms remain familiar relative to (though not exactly<br/>the same as) 12 EDO. The Am chord form is also available for use now,<br/>too.</p><p>17 EDO would probably be a little easier to get used to, because you<br/>literally just push the chord shape one fret higher; but that major<br/>third is really sharp, so you might expect that other tunings would<br/>encourage you to fret a little farther back, and you&apos;d be right. With<br/>19 EDO you&apos;d want to keep one of your fingers back a fret to hit the<br/>379-cent major third.</p><p>In other words, in 12 EDO you finger an E chord as<br/>Open (root)<br/>2nd fret (fifth)<br/>2nd fret (octave)<br/>1st fret (M3)<br/>Open (fifth)<br/>Open (octave)</p><p>In 17 EDO you do it as<br/>Open (root)<br/>3rd fret (fifth)<br/>3rd fret (octave)<br/>2nd fret (M3, 424 cents)<br/>Open (fifth)<br/>Open (octave)</p><p>In 19 EDO you do it as<br/>Open (root)<br/>3rd fret (fifth)<br/>3rd fret (octave)<br/>1st fret (M3, 379 cents)<br/>Open (fifth)<br/>Open (octave)</p><p>31 EDO gives a very nicely tuned open Em-form chord and semi-familiar<br/>chord shapes, but -- without evidence -- I&apos;d guess that it would be a<br/>little harder to get used to. Too many skips of five frets here and<br/>two frets there, etc. The five frets would be in the space of two<br/>ordinary ones, so it&apos;s not like you&apos;d be stretching more, but the<br/>shapes are starting to get distorted. Plus the frets are getting<br/>really close together as you move up the neck.</p><p>So, Chris, since I&apos;m probably not buying a 19-EDO guitar anytime soon<br/>(unfortunately!), I look forward to your next purchase and<br/>performance. :)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p><p>On 1/19/11, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So you used the other mapping for 5/4 then, treating 424 as though it<br/>&gt; were the major third?

So<br/>aeolian scales, for example, rather than being based around 5-limit<br/>minor triads like 10:12:15, end up being based around 7-limit subminor<br/>triads like 6:7:9.

The minor thirds are<br/>closer to 7/6 than 6/5, and the major thirds are closer to 9/7 than<br/>5/4. So I asked if you tuned your guitar to &quot;superpyth open&quot; - e.g. E<br/>A D G B E all around the circle of fifths, same as in 12-equal.</p><p>Lastly, there are two intervals in 17-tet that could work as a normal<br/>5/4 major third - you have the 353 cent &quot;neutral&quot; third, and the 424<br/>cent really sharp &quot;supermajor&quot; third. Neither is really close to the<br/>sweet spot of 386 cents, which is what a just 5/4 is. The 353 cent<br/>neutral third is actually closer, but I prefer to use the 424 cent<br/>supermajor version, since it sounds more like a major third to me.</p><p>So when you talk about major chord voicings on this guitar, which<br/>version are you using?
