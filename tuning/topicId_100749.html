The generator is pretty flat for a 10/9; it&apos;s much closer to 11/10. In fact, if you temper out 9801/9800 then you can equate 2/(9/7)^2 with (11/10)^2, and hence sqrt(2)/(9/7) with 11/10.</p><p>All of this leaves me wondering where, if I was to link this piece as a musical example on the xenwiki, what I should consider it an example of. That&apos;s the regular mapping paradigm for you. But I think your no-fives and/or rank three temperament extends very naturally to the 11-limit by tossing 9801/9800 into the mix.</p></div><h3><a id=100752 href="#100752">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2011 1:28:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; Essentially hedgehog?

At that time, I chose a generator equal to the 5th root of 8/5.</p><p>Even though the mapping is the same in both cases, each improv is in a slightly different mood, I think that&apos;s because of the slightly different generators and also the stress on 7-limit intervals in the newer one.</p><p>The older one is here:<br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/PPImprovX.mp3">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8497979/PPImprovX.mp3</a></p><p>Petr</p></div>
