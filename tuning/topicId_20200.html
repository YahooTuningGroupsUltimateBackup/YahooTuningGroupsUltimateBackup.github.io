Please let me confirm that your English translations<br/>are not only understandable but very pleasant to read.</p><p>From the passages you quote, I might guess that there are actually at<br/>least two different models of intonation involved here: a kind of<br/>split-key meantone-oriented model where indeed the &quot;lesser diesis&quot; of<br/>128:125 (~41.06 cents) or about 1/5-tone defines the difference<br/>between the semitones; and a model evidently borrowed and adapted from<br/>late medieval or very early Renaissance times which divided a<br/>whole-tone into nine &quot;commas.&quot;</p><p>The latter model resembles both 15th-century and later explanations of<br/>Pythagorean intonation where the small and large semitones<br/>(respectively the diatonic _limma_ and chromatic _apotome_ from a<br/>conventional Gothic point of view) are estimated at about 4/9-tone and<br/>5/9-tone, and the system of 53 tones or &quot;commas&quot; to an octave<br/>attributed to the younger Mercator and expounded by Kircher (1650).</p><p>In a 16th-century or later setting, the latter model is often modified<br/>so that the usual diatonic semitone is the _large_ semitone of &quot;five<br/>commas,&quot; and the chromatic semitone the _small_ semitone of &quot;four<br/>commas.&quot; This reversal, in effect, produces a close approximation of<br/>just intonation with pure ratios of 3 and 5, since the 1/9-tone<br/>&quot;comma&quot; is quite close to the syntonic comma of 81:80 (~21.51 cents).</p><p>In 53-tone equal temperament (53-tET), where the ninefold division of<br/>the tone precisely obtains, this 1/9-tone is about 22.64 cents --<br/>quite distinct from the 1/4-comma meantone diesis of almost twice this<br/>size often more or less closely approximated on split-key instruments.</p><p>However, in 5-based just intonation as in a 1/4-comma meantone tuning<br/>with pure major thirds (sometimes known in Germanic traditions as the<br/>&quot;Praetorian&quot; tuning because of its advocacy by Michael Praetorius in<br/>his _Syntagma Musica_ of 1619), the lesser diesis is equal to the<br/>amount by which three pure major thirds at 5:4 (~386.31 cents) fall<br/>short of a pure 2:1 octave, or 128:125.</p><p>It may also be defined as the difference between a major third and a<br/>diminished fourth, with the latter interval (e.g. C#-F) equal either<br/>in 5-based just intonation according to Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic as<br/>adopted by Zarlino, or in 1/4-comma meantone, to 32:25 (~427.37<br/>cents), again a difference of 128:125 or about 1/5-tone. This lesser<br/>diesis also defines the difference between the diatonic semitone of<br/>16:15 and the usual chromatic semitone of 25:24 in the syntonic<br/>diatonic.</p><p>During the meantone era of the late 15th-17th centuries, theorists<br/>sometimes refer to both the 1/5-tone (lesser diesis) and 1/9-tone<br/>(&quot;comma&quot;) models. For example, in the introduction to his &quot;example of<br/>circulation&quot; demonstrating how one make cadences in turn on all 31<br/>steps of his enharmonic keyboard, the _Sambuca Lincea_, Fabio Colonna<br/>(1618) asserts that this musical piece proves that the whole-tone<br/>divides neatly into five tones, and not into nine commas as some have<br/>maintained. (His piece has a chain of cadences progressing around the<br/>circle of fifths or fourths, and as he notes demonstrates the use of<br/>such routine idioms as suspended fourths resolving to thirds.)</p><p>Of course, we know that either the 1/5-tone or the 1/9-tone model may<br/>hold depending on the tuning system in use: 1/5-tones in a meantone at<br/>or near 1/4-comma; and 1/9-tones in Pythagorean or 53-tET.</p><p>Both your fascinating sampling of 18th-century opinions and a<br/>discussion of intonation in Kirnberger (1771) suggest that both models<br/>may have played a role in the theory of this era also. For Kirnberger,<br/>the two &quot;standard&quot; models for vocal intonation are the &quot;older&quot;<br/>Pythagorean scale and the &quot;modern&quot; scale of Zarlino. For keyboards, he<br/>favors some form of unequal well-temperament, and specifically warns<br/>against the levelling of the major and minor keys which would occur<br/>were 12-tET to prevail.</p><p>Here are passages you translate where a model based on the division of<br/>the tone into nine &quot;commas&quot; rather than five dieses seems indicated to<br/>me:</p><p>[Agricola, 1757, after discussing split keys, now considered outmoded<br/>with the art of 12-note well-temperaments favored instead]</p><p>&gt; ...[follows a short discussion of the division of the whole tone in<br/>&gt; nine &quot;commas&quot;]</p><p>Here it&apos;s interesting that the same author would apparently recommend<br/>split keys as a model of correct intonation (likely separated by about<br/>1/5-tone, at least if we assume a &quot;Praetorian&quot; or similar temperament)<br/>and then present the 1/9-tone or &quot;nine comma&quot; model.</p><p>Such a mixing of models, however, may have interesting precedents.<br/>Thus around 1500, theorists such as Gaffurius and Aaron present<br/>traditional Pythagorean tuning with its small diatonic and large<br/>chromatic semitones as the favored theoretical model, although both<br/>describe some form of meantone tuning as what is used in practice on<br/>keyboard instruments. Here the nature of the Pythagorean-meantone<br/>transition makes such theoretical mixing of the two approaches not so<br/>surprising.</p><p>[From Quantz, 1752]</p><p>&gt; The major semitone has 5 commata, the minor has 4 [commata].<br/>&gt; Therefore the E-flat must be a comma [=small diesis] higher than D#.</p><p>Here, we have the theoretical model of the &quot;nine commas&quot; to a tone, as<br/>would literally obtain in 53-tET as suggested by Kircher, here<br/>following an interpretation of interval spellings based on a major<br/>third close to 5:4 (17/53 octave), with a large diatonic semitone of 5<br/>&quot;commas&quot; (close to 16:15). Here the difference between Eb and D# would<br/>be roughly equal to either a syntonic comma of 81:80, or to the<br/>Pythagorean comma of 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents).</p><p>The &quot;five diesis&quot; model is especially characteristic of enharmonicists<br/>such as Vicentino (1555) and Colonna, and the former specifically<br/>recommended the archicembalo with its 31-note division of the octave<br/>as a model for singers. This model, of course, would also fit split<br/>key instruments of from 13 to 16 notes per octave as long as they are<br/>tuned in a meantone temperament not too far from 1/4-comma.</p><p>However, there is one possible hypothesis that might roughly reconcile<br/>the &quot;split-key diesis&quot; and &quot;comma&quot; models: a split-key instrument<br/>tuned not at or near 1/4-comma, but rather in the kind of meantone<br/>with major thirds somewhat wider than pure favored around 1700, say<br/>1/5-1/6 comma (the latter temperament being identified with the famed<br/>organ designer Silbermann).</p><p>While the meantone diesis at 1/4-comma is indeed identical to the<br/>lesser diesis at about 1/5-tone or ~41.06 cents, as the amount of<br/>temperament is decreased this diesis becomes smaller. At 1/5-comma, it<br/>is about 28.16 cents, say 1/7-tone; while at 1/6-comma it shrinks to<br/>about 19.55 cents, say 1/10-tone, the latter quite close to the<br/>&quot;comma&quot; of the traditional ninefold division.</p><p>By a curious coincidence, 2/11-comma produces a diesis of about 23.46<br/>cents, virtually identical to the Pythagorean comma which inspired the<br/>approximate &quot;nine comma&quot; division of the tone proposed in the 15th<br/>century. If later split-key instruments were often tempered by about<br/>this amount, then the &quot;nine comma&quot; model _would_ quite nicely fit the<br/>actual intonation, and difference between semitones, on these<br/>keyboards.</p><p>This raises a question, however: what would be the typical amount of<br/>meantone temperament on late split-key instruments, or on those known<br/>to the 18th-century authors you quote?</p><p>There is at least some anecdotal evidence that split-keys would have<br/>been useful for 1/6-comma organs such as Silbermann&apos;s; a humorous<br/>story has it that Bach would delight in playing in remote keys on such<br/>instruments in order to demonstrate the limits of satisfactory<br/>transpositions, and once even induced Silbermann himself to leave the<br/>scene in order to escape the dissonance of his own organ&apos;s Wolf!</p><p>Was the taste for lesser amounts of temperament in meantones around<br/>1700 inspired in part by a desire to make diminished fourths at least<br/>marginally &quot;playable&quot; as major thirds by the standards of the times --<br/>or were other considerations such as smoother fifths or narrower<br/>diatonic semitones the main motivation?</p><p>Would there be a tendency to temper split-key meantone instrument<br/>somewhat more heavily, since correctly-spelled thirds would be<br/>available at more locations, while somewhat lessening the temperament<br/>of 12-note meantone instruments in order to make diminished fourths<br/>more nearly equivalent to usual major thirds?</p><p>Please let me warn that here I am getting outside my main era of<br/>familiarity, and should be especially subject to correction.</p><p>However, the interplay between the &quot;five dieses&quot; and &quot;nine commas&quot;<br/>models for dividing the whole-tone is apparently a notable factor in<br/>18th-century theory, as your quotes suggest, and as in 16th-17th<br/>century theory, this interplay might merit much further study.</p><p>Thank you again for your translations, at once informative and<br/>stirring the imagination to consider more closely the interactions of<br/>singers, instruments, and musical concepts adapted to new settings.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
