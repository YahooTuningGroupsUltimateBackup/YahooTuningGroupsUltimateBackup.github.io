How accurate is a single<br/>frequency in a musical tone, 6 cents?  It&apos;s a flatline on a tuner, no?  How<br/>could a player perform a 7/6 (276 cents) minor third 6 cents sharper or<br/>flatter and still call it a 7/6?

I can write *towards*<br/>certain ideal things that I can play very accurately pitch wise, but<br/>other things would not be so paratacticly amenable to the same degree<br/>of accuracy. It varies quite a bit. (And one cent accuracy in most<br/>registers is simply impossible in all but the most opportune of<br/>clinical type examples.)</p><p>I think you sort of say these same sorts of things sometimes, but<br/>other times you seem to me to give the impression that anything is<br/>playable by any free pitch instrument to an accuracy of one cent.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=24492 href="#24492">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/7/2001 4:45:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dan,</p><p>Actually guitar is one of the most limited for pitch accuracy, unless while<br/>it is electric, a master is controlling it, like Jon Catler, for example.

The fleshiness of the finger<br/>makes it different to distinguish exact tone, let alone pitch.  Not quite as<br/>bad as a bass drum, but certainly tough to get an exact frequency.  May I<br/>suggest that just about every other sound maker escapes the guitar&apos;s<br/>limitations?

Frankly, if you, yourself, couldn&apos;t hear less<br/>than 6 seconds, then it&apos;s a moot point, because you&apos;ll never hear what I can<br/>hear...or anyone else that can navigate pitch accurately.</p><p>&gt; 2) that you often times seem to me to give the impression that<br/>&gt; anything is playable by any free pitch instrument to an accuracy of<br/>&gt; one cent<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, the Theremin is a tough one, and the recorder is tough (though less so<br/>in the hands of virtuoso Pete Rose).  But a cello, a voice, a bassoon?  Why<br/>do you think you are so moved by music in the first place?  Because it does<br/>things that are beyond your immediate comprehension.
