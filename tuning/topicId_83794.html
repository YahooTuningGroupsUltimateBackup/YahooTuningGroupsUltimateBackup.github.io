By using a software, the elected groups of peaks shown by the Piagui and eq.tempered chord wave responses (chord wave graphs), are transformed to point marks to get chord wave peak graphs of both chord wave responses. Despite Piagui and e-tempered triad tone components do not differ much, the point marks on the obtained two chord wave peak graphs depicts clear differences. In all cases no matter the triad is, the aesthetic and periodicity of point marks shown by Piagui responses is a constant while those of e-tempered are irregular and far from aesthetics. One second is the period used to examine the responses where mark waves define the harmony quality. One of the noticeable conclusions given by chord wave peak graphs is that as the chord tone frequencies given by keyboards go up, the e-tempered chords become more discordant.<br/>The non-aesthetic and disorderly mark distribution of e-tempered graphs are signs of flawed harmony or distortion. In contrast to the e-tempered responses, Piagui scales produce aesthetic views so its superior harmony is evident.</p></div>
