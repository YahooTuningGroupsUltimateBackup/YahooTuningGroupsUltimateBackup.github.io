Joseph, as to how did it get there, I<br/>originally sent it to Robert Siegal to try for a review...never<br/>happened, but somebody there must dig it...this gives me a whomp in the<br/>booty, and I guess I&apos;ll send &quot;Other Worlds&quot; and see if anything<br/>happens...thanks for the post, Ed...Hstick</p></div>
