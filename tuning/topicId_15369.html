I had better real-time adaptive tuning going on the NeXT (though<br/>&gt;still very far from ideal).  JI Relay is very primitive in its tuning<br/>&gt;choices, and tends to change the tuning too often.  I tossed JI Relay<br/>&gt;off in the first two months after joining the list in March 1999, and<br/>&gt;since then have focused on retuning complete sequence files in<br/>&gt;non-real-time.</p><p>   What exactly is &apos;NeXT&apos;  ?</p><p>I&apos;m always interested in any software synth or hardware based instrument<br/>that could  tune adaptively.</p><p>Pitch palette can&apos;t actually do realtime tuning except by selecting tonic<br/>roots. It has a feature called the hanger button that only works on<br/>&apos;Justonic&apos;s&apos; inhouse synth which is a prototype for a commercial instrument<br/>they wanted to release. They have not done so because the bank would not<br/>lend them the money ! They have said they are trying to encourage<br/>commercial manufacturers to adopt the option but as yet their have been no<br/>takers.</p><p>Justin White</p><p>This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended solely for<br/>the recipient.

It was a company founded by Steve Jobs in 1985, which for 10 years or so produced &quot;black cubes&quot; and other spiffy hardware, with DSP chips on board; the OS was Unix-based and very delightful.  There were some good algorithmic music/sound tools for it, and people still use this platform for some purposes.  The NeXT hardware is all now VERY VERY out of date, slow, and unsupported.</p><p>There is a new release of some of the &quot;Music Kit&quot; software originally from NeXT, now maintained and enhanced by CCRMA at Stanford, and there is ongoing development.
