I<br/>know this is certainly not new (Erv Wilson, SJ Taylor and others have<br/>used these concepts) but I&apos;ve never thought much about it till now...my<br/>question is: by doing that, what sort of symmetry will arise in the<br/>tuning in a mathematical sense? Do 5ths, 3rds and other intervals appear<br/>more/less often in certain shapes, as opposed to others (the Golden Mean<br/>and triangles and all that)? A lot of guitarists use fingerboard shapes<br/>to create their concept of the notes on the neck...Howard Roberts wrote<br/>a series about this in Guitar Player some years ago, and called it<br/>&quot;Sonic Shapes.&quot; Now, I&apos;m curious as to how this can be used with non 12<br/>tunings...in fact, the new piece I&apos;m working on uses this concept<br/>throughout, and the fact that the strings are tuned to a non 12, purely<br/>tuned scale (on my fretless electric) makes the shapes sound totally<br/>unlike my normal ideas, leading to new and unexpected melodic and<br/>rhythmic phrases...the tuning itself is leading the way...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=15245 href="#15245">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Of course, you<br/>can&apos;t accurately stop different strings at different places at the same<br/>time on a slide guitar. . .  and I still like my slide guitar.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
