What am I missing here!</p><p> I was agreeing with Daniel Wolf that the sixth degree of the major scale<br/> should be able to act as _either_ 5/3 _or_ 27/16. Only in the meantone-type<br/> ETs do the major scales you came up with have this property. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Not quite right. I wrote:</p><p>&quot;For another, it is very often more useful to define a scale as a collection<br/>where a given scale step is represented by more than one ratio -- e.g. the<br/>sixth degree in a major scale might be represented by either 27/16 or 5/3,<br/>depending on the context...&quot;</p><p>I have no problem in recognizing a major scale in a more limited collection<br/>where only one of the values is represented. If you want to define &quot;major&quot; by<br/>the presence of both ratios (as either exact ratios or tempered<br/>representations), you will then be limiting the definition to a rather narrow<br/>repertoire.</p></div>
