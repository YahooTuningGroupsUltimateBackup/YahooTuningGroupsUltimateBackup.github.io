My experience has been that, rather than trying to<br/>stretch their understanding a bit, journalists often try to make new<br/>concepts fit into THEIR framework, which doesn&apos;t usually work. And, once<br/>it&apos;s in print, you&apos;re stuck with it, right or wrong. And, it is<br/>frustrating. Actually, in my recent Electronic Musician Profile, which<br/>was sympathetically done, the quotes attributed to me were used in a way<br/>in which they were not originally meant, so my words did not make the<br/>sense that they were intended to. Of course, anyone reading the article<br/>would not know that, and think I said things the way they were printed.<br/>In that case, at least they liked what I was doing, so I &quot;escaped,&quot; as I<br/>like to say. In Ed&apos;s case, they took something that they obviously knew<br/>next to nothing about, and dealt with it very poorly...sorry, Ed, you<br/>deserve better...Hstick</p></div>
