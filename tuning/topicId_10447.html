If<br/>&gt;a composer can&apos;t get 5-consonance across with the music, they shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;depend on tuning to do it for them.</p><p>I have to admit, I didn&apos;t put that point very well. Though a historical<br/>example might be appropriate (read Margo Schulter&apos;s page for background). In<br/>the early and middle medieval period, Pythagorean tuning was the norm,<br/>because there was a consonance limit of 3, and therefore no need for prime<br/>factors above 3 (see below). Harmony was dyadic (or trinic, to use Margo&apos;s<br/>term, referring to the dyad plus the octave doubling). Thirds and sixths,<br/>which were not simple ratios, were used as dissonances, avoided in final<br/>chords. The tuning they had was felt to be just right for the feeling of the<br/>music -- in fact, any tuning inflections that were suggested for cadential<br/>purposes tended to tune them _away_ from the nearest 5-limit consonances.<br/>Then, as a new, 5-limit, triadic, style began to spread from the Celts, the<br/>Pythagorean tuning was first adapted with flats in place of sharp to exploit<br/>schismatic relationships, and then replaced outright with a tuning in which<br/>the thirds and sixths were far closer to the simple 5-limit ratios:<br/>meantone.</p><p>&gt;Secondly, though proper intonation has a different importance for simple<br/>and<br/>&gt;complex intervals, niether is more important than the other.<br/>Out-of-tuneness<br/>&gt;is definately more noticable for simple consonances, but in Partch&apos;s own<br/>&gt;words, &quot;The higher the numbers of a ratio the more subtle its effect, and<br/>&gt;the more scrupulously should we try to foretall its dissipation in the<br/>&gt;stronger ratios surrounding it.&quot;</p><p>But I see no need to _use_ any ratios with prime numbers above the<br/>consonance limit, since the only audible meaning that ratio-complexity has<br/>is: if an interval is close to a simple ratio, it&apos;s consonant. And though<br/>Partch&apos;s statement is absolutely true, it doesn&apos;t contradict the following<br/>statement: The more complex a ratio, the less mistuning affects its<br/>consonance. See the harmonic entropy graphs and/or Sethares&apos; dissonance<br/>graphs to understand how both statements can be true at once. Finally, with<br/>13-(odd)-limit dyads, in most ways mistuning makes no difference, because<br/>(a) you can&apos;t perceive the ratio in terms of an implied fundamental without<br/>help from combination tones, and (b), though the just ratio minimizes one<br/>beat rate, other beat rates (of stronger partials) will be very disturbing<br/>at the same time and the perception of consonance associated with<br/>beat-elimination fails to &quot;make it through&quot;; e.g. for a 13:11 or near-13:11<br/>the beatings of 6:5 and of 7:6 will tend to be the prominent elements.</p><p>&gt;If harmonic intervals are wanted to be in JI (not saying they always are),<br/>&gt;why shouldn&apos;t melodic ones?</p><p>Because for melodic ratios more complex than 4:3, it makes no acoustical or<br/>psychoacoustical difference. Let&apos;s go back to the historical example --<br/>we&apos;re now in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. The major seconds in<br/>meantone are halfway between 10:9 and 9:8: one could use the usual,<br/>irrational, geometric mean; or one could use the JI interval 19:17; it<br/>really makes no difference in how the music sounds. As long as all the<br/>melodic major seconds are perceptually the same, the motivic structure of<br/>the music will remain intact, one will never encounter comma drifts or<br/>shifts, and one is even free to use melodically sub-noticeable 6&cent; shifts to<br/>achieve perfect JI harmonies as in Vicentino&apos;s second tuning of 1555.</p><p>&gt;I always make sure my compositions have not only<br/>&gt;vertical but horizontal JI: they sound better to me that way. In a<br/>&gt;1/1-5O&gt;4/3-5O&gt;3/2-7O&gt;1/1-5O (I-IV-V7-I) cadence, I think the 64/63<br/>&gt;difference between the 4/3 and the 21/16 shouldn&apos;t be hidden, but<br/>celebrated<br/>&gt;and exploited as a subtle nuance. Don&apos;t call it &quot;microtonal&quot; if you&apos;re<br/>&gt;afraid to use microtones!</p><p>Huh? I&apos;m certainly not afraid to use microtones, especially those in 22-tET.<br/>See my paper (<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>, ignore page<br/>20) for more on my philosophy on the above. But the I-IV-V7-I cadence is, in<br/>many ways, the antithesis of what the goal of &quot;microtonal&quot; music is to many<br/>of us -- to provide us with a new language that allows for a new form of<br/>tonality, as opposed to the abandonment of tonality that occured in the last<br/>century.</p></div>
