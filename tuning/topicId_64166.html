Pure JI<br/>2. Temperaments which approximate JI<br/>3. Arbitrary tunings</p><p>Both Pythagorean and the &quot;Just tuning&quot; you mention are what<br/>would fall under #1 here.  The difference is, in Pythagorean<br/>tuning, there is a way to connect all of the pithes using only<br/>a single interval (the 3:2), whereas in the harmonic series<br/>one can only join all the pitches by using many different<br/>intervals.</p><p>The single-chain approach leads rapidly to temperament.  In<br/>Pythagorean tuning, descending eight 3:2 fifths from a starting<br/>pitch yields an interval very close to the 5:4 &apos;major third&apos;<br/>(ignoring octaves).  By using this interval as a consonance in<br/>a triad, one is already doing what might be called &quot;schismatic&quot;<br/>temperament of a sort.  If one uses only the 2:1, 3:2, 4:3<br/>intervals (and their octave extensions) as consonances, one is<br/>instead treating the tuning as Pure JI.</p><p>So, much of the distinction between temperament and JI is<br/>blurry or hard to define.</p><p>One can chain other intervals besides 3:2.  Pythagorean<br/>tuning is the name for the case when 3:2 is used, but other<br/>intervals are often used.</p><p>Arbitrary tunings are just that -- the composer has picked<br/>intervals according to his fancy.  Or maybe he is just using<br/>them that way.  For example, 12-tone equal temperament is<br/>certainly capable of &quot;approximating JI&quot;, as in #2 above.<br/>A triad on the piano sounds very much like (approximates) a<br/>4:5:6 chord in just intonation.  However, many 20th-century<br/>composers wrote atonal music in 12-tET.  To me, this makes<br/>their tuning choice fanciful, as in #3.  It&apos;s a fine approach.<br/>I mean the word &quot;fanciful&quot; in a positive sense.</p><p>So, again we see that the distinction between tunings has<br/>much to do with how they are used in music.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2006 7:17:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;Hello ALL, I know of two tuning systems:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;1.

Similar temperaments can be built from different sets of tempered intervals; these are typically referred to as &quot;regular temperaments&quot; on the list. Over a hundred of these have been theoretically described, but only a few are in common use. &quot;Miracle&quot; is one that&apos;s had some popularity, built from an interval that is roughly 1/6 the size of a perfect fifth (7 steps of 72-equal is one possible tuning).
