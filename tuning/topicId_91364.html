I&apos;m thinking you&apos;re talking about &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; (I think I read someone use that term once, not sure if there&apos;s a better term for it), the phenomenon that occurs when a harmonic timbre plays a simple JI ratio and all the harmonics of the two notes &quot;lock in&quot; real solid.  But I want to be sure I know what you&apos;re talking about before I send you off on a scalar goose-chase.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;christopherv&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is a truly n00b question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to experiment with a tuning that is capable of getting the &quot;JI Growl&quot; or &quot;roughness or whatever the proper term is.
