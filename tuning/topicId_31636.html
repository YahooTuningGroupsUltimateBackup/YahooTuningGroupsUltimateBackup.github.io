There is a symmetrical pattern to the values of the &quot;superparticular&quot; step-sizes which he derives (or presents) as well, where a &quot;mirror-image&quot; symmetry exists in the numerical values of the presented step-sizes (centered around the step-size of 50/49, which is located in the center of the set of step-sizes). See the JPG which appears in the webpage itself in order to see what I am describing above. Pretty neat, eh?</p><p>If one (arbitrarily, of course) limits Dante&apos;s given set of step-sizes to those which do not contain integers (in their numerator or denominator) of a value greater than 25, a certain (basically familiar) 10-tone set of JI pitch ratios scale emerges [when one adds a 1/1 scale pitch, as well as adding a pitch which serves as a &quot;suitable approximation&quot; to the SQRT(2), which could be either 7/5, 10/7, or the &quot;infamous&quot; 45/32], which, then, contains the following pitch-values listed below:</p><p>1/1--16/15--10/9--6/5--5/4--4/3--Tritone--3/2--8/5--5/3--9/5--15/8</p><p>Having seen (but not comprehending) references on the ATL (and, perhaps, the tuning-math group as well) to the phrase &quot;superparticular unison vectors&quot;, I [imagining if Dante&apos;s symmetrical set of &quot;superparticular step-sizes&quot; was interpreted, instead, as &quot;superparticular unison vectors&quot; (the ratios between a given set of rationally valued &quot;step-sizes&quot;, when the set&apos;s distinct, non-repeating &quot;step-sizes&quot; are ordered in ascending pitch)], then (working &quot;backwards&quot; from the given set of &quot;scale pitches&quot;, derived the set of ratios which (on the premise of the &quot;superparticular&quot; set being a set of &quot;unison vectors&quot;) would (in this case) constitute a resultant set of *scale pitch ratios*.</p><p>The resultant (non-sorted for ascending numerical value) set of &quot;scale pitch ratios&quot; is as follows:</p><p>1/1--16/15--32/27--4/3--3/2--7/4--21/10--21/8--27/8--9/2</p><p>63/10</p><p>9/1--27/2--21/1--168/5--56/1--96/1--168/1--896/3--2688/59--5040/5</p><p>within which these (arbitrarily selected, and octave-reduced) scale pitch ratios are derived below:</p><p>16/15--4/3--3/2--7/4--27/16--9/8</p><p>Evidently (in this particular case of &quot;superparticular&quot; rational numbers, anyway) &quot;superparticular step-size&quot; appears to be more desirable than &quot;superparticular unison vectors! The above seems like a rather small range of resultant rational &quot;scale-pitch&quot; choices... (to me, anyway).</p><p>Perhaps I have made a procedural error in my interpretation of the method by which &quot;unison-vectors&quot; are derived from &quot;step-sizes&quot;? Perhaps I chose a certain case where &quot;superparticular unison vectors&quot; do not work out so well (while, perhaps, yielding stellar results in other specific cases)?

What I study is always the operative structure on<br/>a set of elements and in that sense the particularity &quot;pitch&quot; as nothing to do with that.</p><p>In mathematics the elements are defined by the structure and not inversely. It&apos;s important<br/>in modelization to insure that the correspondance between real objects and symbols is<br/>valid, but the proper of a good model is its capacity to derive things without interference, i.e.<br/>unconscious subtle choices and corrections resulting from the objects comprehension. If the<br/>model fail to derive by itself, we have to correct the model, not its results.</p><p>Pierre</p></div><h3><a id=31798 href="#31798">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2001 2:06:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Pierre!</p><p>&gt; From: Pierre Lamothe &lt;<a href="mailto:plamothe@aei.ca">plamothe@aei.ca</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: Tuning &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 20, 2001 12:51 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: great explanation [periodicity block]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz, do you remember the S-matrix used on my site, on this<br/>&gt; List and in private posts with Paul and you ?</p><p>No, actually, I didn&apos;t remember... but that&apos;s because I had<br/>such a hard time understanding what you were posting that got<br/>into the habit of printing out all of your posts and saving<br/>them for future comprehensive study, and I haven&apos;t yet had<br/>the time to dig into that.

If for instance we write things in the notation &lt;81/80,25/24,16/15&gt;^(-1) = [h3,h5,h7] then we decompose the representation into irreducible factors, where 16/15 is left fixed by the second factor, the identity representation.
