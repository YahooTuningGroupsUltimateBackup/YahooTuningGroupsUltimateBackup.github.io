As you may remember, the reason I spent a few<br/>months on the list last year looking for a rationale for the high third was<br/>because the third I was hearing from my singers (both novice and<br/>professional) is somewhat *higher* than the 12-tET third. (This is not meant<br/>to rehash the past, but simply to keep it in mind.)</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/8/2002 11:20:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gerald said:<br/>As you may remember, the reason I spent a few<br/>months on the list last year looking for a rationale for the high third was<br/>because the third I was hearing from my singers (both novice and<br/>professional) is somewhat *higher* than the 12-tET third.</p><p>Pehaps it is time to consider that Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic (widely used in Bach&apos;s time in Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt) used 4 different major thirds, and all of them sharper than just.

(Well, Johnny Reinhard *has*<br/>promised me the fingerings!)</p><p>For the time being, I am concentrating on *solo* instrumental pieces<br/>with electronics.  I have *plenty* of larger pieces in my oeuvre, and<br/>it seems that this is the most *practical* and best way,<br/>educationally, to get new players to understand and want to play<br/>these new tunings.  And I can also work with the player *directly* as<br/>necessary.</p><p>That&apos;s whatssup...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
