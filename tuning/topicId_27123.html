Your inquiry has moved<br/>me to suggest one possible interpretation of this tuning as a kind of<br/>well-temperament, reflecting some features of musical style in early<br/>16th-century Europe (the era of such composers as Josquin in his later<br/>years, Isaac, and Senfl).</p><p>Incidentally, I have much enjoyed your discussion of some mathematical<br/>techniques for dividing commas in the era of Werckmeister, which<br/>remind me of the medieval and Renaissance theory with which I am<br/>familiar. Also, I would much agree that riddles and puzzles are part<br/>of the musical tradition, going back to at least the 13th or 14th<br/>century: Glareanus (1547), in discussing the style of his model<br/>Josquin, mentions that he sometimes follows the custom of writing<br/>canons with arcane clues and solutions.</p><p>As you very wisely remark, Schlick&apos;s approach to temperament has much<br/>fascinating musical philosophy to offer on such topics as the balance<br/>between fifths and thirds, and also the very important observations<br/>about beats which you mentioned, but does not define the tuning<br/>process with any mathematical precision. It is a matter of taste and<br/>judgement, with room for a range of interpretations.</p><p>Thus James Murray Barbour[1] has taken Schlick as suggesting a kind of<br/>well-temperament not too far from 12-tone equal temperament (12-tET),<br/>Barbour&apos;s own standard measure for tunings. Mark Lindley, in contrast,<br/>has asserted that the tuning has a definite &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; which should<br/>not be considered playable, better approximating a usual 16th-century<br/>meantone tuning than a &quot;well-temperament&quot; model.[2] In part, Lindley&apos;s<br/>view may represent a kind of reaction to Barbour, possibly I would say<br/>an overcorrective reaction.</p><p>My own interpretation, based in part on Schlick&apos;s eloquent and nicely<br/>considered language, and in part on sheer musical intuition, is that<br/>his tuning is indeed a kind of well-temperament, in which many<br/>intervals approach a meantone ideal and a few are quite marginal,<br/>&quot;little esteemed and seldom used,&quot; to quote Lindley&apos;s translation.</p><p>This well-temperament is fascinating not only for showing one method<br/>of arranging 12 notes in a tuning circle using fifths of various sizes<br/>and thirds moving progressively further from pure as we shift from<br/>common to remote transpositions, but in evidencing some modal and<br/>vertical preferences as they influence the tuning practices of at<br/>least one sensitive composer and theorist in the second decade of the<br/>16th century.</p><p>---------------------------<br/>1. Schlick&apos;s tuning process<br/>---------------------------</p><p>Here I rely on Mark Lindley&apos;s excerpts giving relevant text passages<br/>and translations of Schlick&apos;s treatise, but have felt free to make my<br/>own interpretation of the tuning and of &quot;well-temperament&quot; (a term not<br/>used by Schlick himself).</p><p>A reader comparing my interpretation with Lindley&apos;s will see how I am<br/>much indebted to his basic mathematical approach and conclusions, with<br/>our main difference one of musical evaluation and characterization.</p><p>As noted by Lindley, Schlick gives a very vivid and readable<br/>explanation of what would in later theory be called the &quot;syntonic<br/>comma problem,&quot; emphasizing the need (in a Renaissance as opposed to<br/>medieval style, we might add) to narrow the fifths lest the major<br/>thirds be &quot;altogether too high.&quot;</p><p>He also gives a most memorable account of the beating of a properly<br/>tempered fifth: the fifth should not be precisely &quot;correct,&quot; but<br/>should somewhat &quot;break up&quot; or &quot;hiccup,&quot; yet so that a listener would<br/>not criticize the fifth as obviously wrong.</p><p>He also introduces what might be termed the principle of irregular<br/>temperament when he notes that the fifths between diatonic notes<br/>should &quot;suffer&quot; more for the sake of their thirds than the fifths<br/>involving accidentals.</p><p>In a wonderfully poetic expression, he explains that the notes of a<br/>fifth should be tuned so that the two note do not quite fully satisfy<br/>in their blend, but &quot;ever and more crave one another.&quot;</p><p>These two concepts, of distinctly but discreetly tempered fifths and<br/>of greater temperament for diatonic fifths than for those involving<br/>accidentals, apply for the ten fifths in the circle from Eb to C#.</p><p>Now we come to a question which Bartoleme Ramos (1482) had earlier<br/>raised: what about the choice, in a 12-note tuning, between Ab and G#?<br/>Ramos concluded that Ab was the more prudent choice, noting that some<br/>people attempt to satisfy both sides of the argument by using split<br/>keys to provide both notes.</p><p>Schlick also leans toward Ab, but with a deliberate compromise between<br/>the two notes within a 12-note tuning, so that the same key can serve<br/>as either a reasonably serviceable Ab, or as a marginal G# for use in<br/>aptly ornamented cadences on A. As Lindley points out, this preference<br/>reflects the style of Schlick&apos;s own organ music, which has Ab-C-Eb as<br/>a prolonged concord, but a more gingerly and ornamental use of G# in<br/>cadences to A.</p><p>As Lindley discusses, this suggests making the major third Ab-C rather<br/>tense but &quot;acceptable,&quot; possibly comparable to 12-tET at around 400<br/>cents, and E-G# (or E-Ab) roughly Pythagorean (around 408 cents).</p><p>Schlick also notes that the fifth C#-G#/Ab will be too large, but says<br/>that this should not trouble the musician, since it is &quot;not used,&quot; and<br/>advises that transpositions might best avoid this interval if<br/>possible.</p><p>The major third B-D#/Eb is also &quot;little esteemed and seldom used.&quot;</p><p>While Lindley takes Schlick&apos;s remarks about C#-G#/Ab to imply an<br/>outright Wolf, I interpret them instead as comparable with a<br/>&quot;marginally playable&quot; kind of fifth. In fact, Lindley&apos;s own suggestion<br/>of a fifth about 8-10 cents wide would seem to fall in the latter<br/>category, at least by many later standards, in contrast to the usual<br/>&quot;Wolf fifths&quot; of regular meantones in the range of 1/3-1/6 syntonic<br/>comma.</p><p>In such regular meantones, a 12-note tuning has a single &quot;Wolf fifth&quot;<br/>about 15.97 cents wide in 1/6-comma, and yet wider in Renaissance<br/>meantones such as 1/4-comma, 2/7-comma, or 1/3-comma. In these<br/>tunings, the 11 regular fifths are each narrowed by the same amount so<br/>as to achieve pure or near-pure thirds; the remaining diminished sixth<br/>(typically G#-Eb, but sometimes C#-Ab or D#-Bb) absorbs the full brunt<br/>of balancing the Pythagorean comma.[3]</p><p>In contrast, whether by design or as a side-effect of the calculated<br/>compromise between Ab and G#, Schlick&apos;s tuning produces _two_ fifths<br/>wider than pure, Ab/G#-Eb and C#-Ab/G#, which &quot;bisect&quot; the Wolf,<br/>albeit in an unequal manner leaving the latter as a kind of<br/>&quot;near-Wolf.&quot;</p><p>While any mathematical interpretation is indeed that, a possible<br/>translation into numbers of Schlick&apos;s own qualitative rather than<br/>quantitive approach, I would like to suggest such an interpretation<br/>close to Lindley&apos;s in its interval sizes, and then to consider a<br/>couple of interesting musical implications.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>2. An interpretation: a &quot;marginal well-temperament&quot;<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>In his interpretation of Schlick&apos;s tuning, Lindley suggests making the<br/>six fifths between diatonic notes (F-C-G-D-A-E-B) each about 4 cents<br/>narrow, and the four fifths involving accidentals other than G#/Ab<br/>(Eb-Bb-F, B-F#-C#) about 3 cents narrow.</p><p>This arrangement involves about 36 cents of total narrowing for these<br/>ten fifths, exceeding the Pythagorean comma of 543411:524288 (~23.46<br/>cents) by roughly 12 cents.</p><p>He interprets Schlick&apos;s compromise regarding Ab/G# to call for a fifth<br/>Ab-Eb about two cents wider than pure, leaving about 8-10 cents for<br/>what he terms the &quot;Wolf&quot; fifth C#-Ab/G#, and I would term a marginally<br/>playable fifth. This makes E-G# roughly Pythagorean, as described<br/>above, and the more &quot;serviceable&quot; Ab-C about as in 12-tET.</p><p>Here I would like again to observe, as does Lindley, that any<br/>mathematical interpretation of Schlick&apos;s temperament -- or tuning of<br/>it by ear on a keyboard instrument -- represents an exercise in the<br/>art of musical estimation. Just as a 16th-century vocal composition<br/>leaving many decisions about accidentals to the judgment of the<br/>performers might inspire instrumental versions resolving these<br/>decisions in a variety of ways, so Schlick&apos;s vivid and musically<br/>sensitive description leaves much room for taste and choice.</p><p>While Lindley uses cents as a convenient unit in his interpretation of<br/>Schlick&apos;s tuning, I shall here use fractions of the Pythagorean comma,<br/>or PC, with 1/24 PC just a tad smaller than 1 cent.</p><p>Since both cents and fractions of a Pythagorean comma are units<br/>favored in later eras of theory, there is a certain anachronism here,<br/>but an advantage of a focus on the Pythagorean comma is that it may<br/>reflect how the &quot;marginally well-tempered&quot; tuning circle is being<br/>balanced, by design or in part by accident.</p><p>My approach, generally similar to Lindley&apos;s, is to narrow each<br/>diatonic fifth by an arbitrary amont of 1/6 PC (~3.91 cents); and each<br/>fifth involving accidentals other than Ab/G# by 1/8 PC (~2.93 cents).</p><p>We can conveniently express these fractions in what I might term<br/>&quot;Pythagorean cents&quot; (rather like &quot;metric tons&quot;?) of 1/24 PC, or around<br/>0.9775 cents of the usual variety. Each of the six diatonic fifths is<br/>narrowed by 4/24 PC, and each of the four accidental fifths we are now<br/>considering by 3/24 PC.</p><p>This means that the tempering of the diatonic fifths involves a total<br/>of 24 Pythagorean cents, or a full comma (4/24 x 6). The four<br/>accidental fifths involve an additional (3/24 x 4), or 12 Pythagorean<br/>cents -- another 1/2 comma.</p><p>Thus these ten fifths involve a total of 36 Pythagorean cents, or 12<br/>cents beyond the amount necessary to close the tuning circle, and the<br/>remaining two fifths must divide this excess.</p><p>Here, in a result that seems to me rather like Lindley&apos;s, I propose<br/>tempering Ab/G#-Eb at 1/8 PC or 3 Pythagorean cents wide, leaving 3/8<br/>PC or 9 Pythagorean cents for the marginal C#-Ab/G#. The latter fifth,<br/>at around 710.75 cents or ~8.80 cents wide, might well be honored<br/>mainly in the avoidance, as Schlick suggests, yet could be playable in<br/>a pinch, for example in unusual transpositions of certain modes.</p><p>As I will explain in Section 3, its marginal playability might be<br/>improved in one situation where it would be likely to arise --<br/>especially in music following a cadential style not much favored in<br/>&quot;modern&quot; early 16th-century practice.</p><p>Here is a scale file for Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s excellent and free scale<br/>definition and analysis software program Scala, which I again<br/>emphasize is simply one interpretation of Schlick&apos;s temperament:</p><p>! as1511ms.scl<br/>!<br/>Possible well-tempered interpretation of Arnold Schlick&apos;s tuning of 1555<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 88.2700<br/> 196.0900<br/> 303.9100<br/> 392.1800<br/> 501.9550<br/> 589.2475<br/> 698.0450<br/> 799.0225<br/> 894.1350<br/> 1002.9325<br/> 1090.2250<br/> 2/1</p><p>Having suggested a possible tuning circle, I would like to discuss a<br/>few musical implications of this &quot;semi-well-temperament&quot; from a<br/>fascinating era in European music, pursuing my own perspective with<br/>much indebtedness both to Lindley and to Barbour&apos;s earlier study.[4]</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Schlick&apos;s artful balance and its musical context<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>While the term &quot;modified meantone&quot; is sometimes applied to the<br/>well-temperaments of the late 17th-19th centuries, fitting a system of<br/>major and minor keys, this description might even more aptly fit<br/>Schlick&apos;s artful approach to interval aesthetics in an early<br/>16th-century modal setting.</p><p>A very salient feature of Schlick&apos;s tuning, if an approach such as<br/>Lindley&apos;s or mine is generally correct, is the relatively smooth or<br/>&quot;meantone-like&quot; quality of all regular major thirds not involving the<br/>equivocal Ab/G# (F-A, C-E, G-B, Bb-D, Eb-G, D-F#, A-C#). All of these<br/>thirds are within about 7.82 cents of pure, or 1/3 Pythagorean comma,<br/>with a gentle gradation:</p><p>     F-A   C-E  G-B   ~392.18 cents    ~5.87 cents wide of 5:4<br/>     Bb-D  D-F#       ~393.16 cents    ~6.84 cents wide of 5:4<br/>     Eb-G  A-C#       ~394.14 cents    ~7.82 cents wide of 5:4</p><p>These &quot;sweet&quot; thirds throughout the most frequently used portion of<br/>the modal gamut in an early 16th-century style such as Schlick&apos;s<br/>reflect an aesthetic expressed in regular meantones also. One should<br/>strive in a 12-note tuning to make all the usual thirds not very far<br/>from pure, not being too concerned about compromising the more remote<br/>intervals.</p><p>When we focus on this &quot;meantone-like&quot; portion of Schlick&apos;s tuning, the<br/>obvious difference with later 16th-century practice and theory is the<br/>treatment of E-G#.</p><p>By around 1520-1530, a fully concordant major third above E is<br/>becoming an essential feature of style both for final cadences in the<br/>mode of E Phyrgian favoring a major third in the closing sonority, and<br/>at many other places in pieces in various modes. Pietro Aaron&apos;s<br/>_Toscanello_ of 1523, and his treatise on the modes of 1525, discuss<br/>and offer examples of this preference for the major third.</p><p>Thus the most common 16th-century meantone range for 12-note<br/>instruments becomes Eb-G# rather than Ab-C#, and instruments with more<br/>notes per octave such as Vicentino&apos;s (1555) tend to place G# as the<br/>&quot;usual&quot; accidental and Ab as the &quot;less usual&quot; one.</p><p>In Schlick&apos;s era, however, there was evidently no such stylistic and<br/>intonational consensus: Schlick treats G# quite gingerly as a<br/>cadential semitone in ornamental approaches to A, and feels free to<br/>tune his compromise Ab/G# accordingly, with the accent on a relatively<br/>more concordant Ab-C, which he uses as a sustained consonance in his<br/>own writing for organ.</p><p>In 1482, Ramos seems to observe that while some people favor G# as a<br/>major third in E Phyrgian, the &quot;incitative&quot; nature of this mode also<br/>admits of the minor third below and major third above (E-G-B), or the<br/>simple fifth (E-B); his remark may well describe the stylistic<br/>situation around 1500 also.</p><p>At the opening of the 16th century, composers such as Josquin and<br/>Isaac are starting regularly to close pieces with sonorities including<br/>a third, and such closes also occur in German keyboard music of the<br/>period -- but the third is often minor.</p><p>Of course, the traditional close on what in a medieval setting could<br/>be called a complete trine, e.g. E3-B3-E4 in Phrygian (here C4 shows<br/>middle C), also remains very common in this era around 1500-1520 in<br/>Germany and elsewhere.</p><p>Under these stylistic conditions, the main call for G# might indeed be<br/>what Schlick describes, and caters for in his tuning: a cadence on A<br/>requiring a marginally playable third E-G#, which an organist can<br/>tastefully ornament to avoid making the impurity of this interval too<br/>obvious.</p><p>Focusing on the more &quot;usual&quot; portion of Schlick&apos;s gamut, Eb-C#, we<br/>find he has achieved the same basic ideal as a regular 16th-century<br/>meantone: rather uniformly &quot;sweet&quot; thirds, although not quite as sweet<br/>as in regular schemes such as 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma.</p><p>By way of compensation, if Lindley and I are correct in reading the<br/>approximate temperings of fifths which may be intended, these<br/>intervals are somewhat less impure -- around 3-4 cents -- than in such<br/>regular meantones where they are compromised by about 5-6 cents.</p><p>For the more remote intervals, possibly in part by design and in part<br/>by accident, Schlick&apos;s scheme suggests how it is possible not only to<br/>strike a compromise between Ab-C and E-G#, especially in a style where<br/>both may be somewhat less frequently used than other thirds, but also<br/>to &quot;bisect&quot; the Wolf fifth of a regular meantone so as to make all<br/>fifths (or diminished sixths) at least marginally &quot;playable.&quot;</p><p>If we take the &quot;tempering excess&quot; in this tuning at about 1/2 PC or 12<br/>of our slightly smaller &quot;Pythagorean cents,&quot; then allocating 3 cents<br/>to Ab/G#-Eb, and the remaining 9 cents to C#-Ab/G#, happens to avoid<br/>any outright &quot;Wolf&quot; while strongly favoring Ab-Eb, Schlick&apos;s primary<br/>intention.</p><p>This kind of engagingly &quot;ragged-edged&quot; well-temperament would offer in<br/>a Renaissance kind of setting some strikingly plangent sonorities and<br/>stylistic effects near the extremes of the tuning chain with an<br/>intriguing &quot;partial interchangeability,&quot; while retaining many of the<br/>usual attractions of regular meantones.</p><p>As in these meantones, the emphasis is on the &quot;sweetness&quot; of the usual<br/>gamut -- a higher priority in this kind of modal style than in the<br/>tonally-oriented well-temperaments of Werckmeister and successors.<br/>This &quot;usual&quot; gamut, as in Schlick&apos;s system, might be defined to<br/>include tenth fifths (e.g. Eb-C#), and the seven major thirds formed<br/>within their portion of the chain.</p><p>Two more thirds, for example Ab-C and E-G# in Schlick&apos;s system, are<br/>tempered to be more or less &quot;serviceable,&quot; somewhere (as Lindley and I<br/>interpret it) between 12-tET and Pythagorean, more or less.</p><p>The three remaining diminished fourths are more decidedly marginal<br/>(e.g. B-Eb, C#-F, F#-Bb in Schlick&apos;s system), generally &quot;little<br/>esteemed and seldom used&quot; in a conventional Renaissance setting, as<br/>Schlick aptly puts it, although available in a pinch.</p><p>In either Lindley&apos;s model or my generally similar one, these intervals<br/>have a size of around 414 cents. In a 21st-century setting, these<br/>thirds would be highly esteemed indeed in styles such as neo-Gothic,<br/>where they very closely approximate the regular intervals of 29-tET;<br/>in a 16th-century setting, they would have a plangent flavor as<br/>idiomatically used diminished fourths, but possibly with more utility<br/>as substitute major thirds than their counterparts in a usual meantone<br/>temperament (e.g. 1/4-comma at around 427 cents).</p><p>The most compromised fifth, C#-Ab/G# in Schlick&apos;s system, would be<br/>decidedly more beatful than a regular meantone fifth even in the<br/>19-tET of Costeley or almost identical 1/3-comma temperament of<br/>Salinas (a bit more than 7 cents impure), but yet not &quot;unplayable&quot; in<br/>a pinch at something like 9 cents wide.</p><p>When Schlick remarks that the impurity of this fifth should not<br/>trouble the reader because &quot;it is not in use,&quot; he may be reflecting a<br/>change in cadential aesthetics making the fifth C#-G# -- or most<br/>typically the fourth G#-C# -- indeed less important by around 1500<br/>than in styles of the early to middle 15th century.</p><p>In these earlier styles, a cadential resolution in which a major sixth<br/>expands to an octave while a major third expands to a fifth is one of<br/>the most popular progressions, e.g.</p><p>     C#4 D4<br/>     G#3 A3<br/>     E3  D3</p><p>Interestingly, as Lindley has elsewhere commented, in this type of<br/>progression an upper fourth (here G#3-C#4) impure even by a whole<br/>Pythagorean comma -- and thus a &quot;Wolf&quot; by any usual standard -- may be<br/>quite tolerable both because of the cadential context, and of the more<br/>or less pure quality of the other intervals.</p><p>Thus a player of Schlick&apos;s keyboard playing more &quot;old-fashioned&quot; music<br/>might not find the impurity by around 9 cents of the fourth G#3-C#4<br/>that much of a problem in the main situation where it might occur.</p><p>Could Schlick&apos;s 12-note tuning, or this possible interpretation of it,<br/>be adapted to later 16th-century or similar styles where one desires<br/>to tune E-G# as a usual near-pure third?</p><p>One possible solution would be to regard the &quot;usual&quot; gamut of ten<br/>fifths as Bb-G#, thus including E-G# as the usual major third above<br/>the final in Phyrgian, while regarding Eb-G and Ab-C as the two<br/>thirds to be compromised in Schlick&apos;s manner.</p><p>Thus E-G# would be rather close to pure, along with the other &quot;usual&quot;<br/>fifths; Eb-G might be comparable to 12-tET, and Ab-C to Pythagorean.</p><p>We would have Eb-Bb at around 3 Pythagorean cents wide, and Ab-Eb as<br/>the &quot;marginally playable&quot; fifth around 9 cents wide.</p><p>The pragmatic assumption here is of a style where E-G# occurs more<br/>often than either Ab-Eb or Eb-Bb, an assumption that seems to me to<br/>hold for many 16th-century pieces in what is termed a _cantus durus_<br/>signature with B-natural (German H) rather than Bb (German B).</p><p>The distinct qualities of such a 12-note temperament, somewhere<br/>between those of a regular Renaissance meantone and a conventional<br/>18th-century well-temperament, could have a special appeal --<br/>especially in the kind of 21st-century setting where diminished fourths<br/>at around 414 cents could also invite digressions from a Renaissance<br/>to a neo-Gothic style (where these intervals would make excellent<br/>usual major thirds).</p><p>Comparing this type of circulating &quot;modified meantone&quot; tuning with a<br/>well-temperament in the usual 18th-century fashion may illustrate a<br/>main point of distinction from the viewpoint of playing music in a<br/>Renaissance or related style.</p><p>In the Renaissance-style circulating temperament, seven major thirds<br/>will be within 1/3 Pythagorean comma or 8 Pythagorean cents of just.<br/>In a typical well-temperament of the Bach era or later, in contrast,<br/>we may find three or four major thirds of this &quot;sweet&quot; variety as<br/>judged by 16th-century standards.</p><p>A final caution I would certainly want to add, having presented<br/>Schlick&apos;s tuning within its framework of a 12-note system, is that in<br/>my view larger meantone tuning sets permit yet more uniformly smooth<br/>or &quot;sweet&quot; thirds in a Renaissance setting while opening up various<br/>kinds of special effects, including artful uses of the &quot;odd&quot; intervals<br/>also available in these tunings.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

For the kinds of historical European styles we are considering in<br/>characteristic harmonic timbres, a &quot;Wolf&quot; fifth is described by some<br/>recent scholars as an interval impure by about one half Pythagorean<br/>comma (~11.73 cents) or more, this comma also being known as the<br/>ditonic comma.</p><p>4. Barbour&apos;s model, see n. 1 above, p. 138, is also of interest.<br/>Rightly correcting earlier notions in the historical literature that<br/>Schlick was describing 1/4-comma meantone, he describes the system as<br/>&quot;somewhere between meantone and equal temperament.&quot; Offering one<br/>possible interpretations, he suggests narrowing each of the six<br/>diatonic fifths by 4 cents, and each of the four accidental fifths not<br/>involving Ab/G# by 2 cents. Both Lindley and I follow his first<br/>estimate, but suggest a somewhat greater temperament of the latter<br/>fifths by about 3 cents, roughly as in 1/7-comma meantone rather than<br/>12-tET. In Barbour&apos;s more &quot;balanced&quot; tuning circle, Ab-C# and E-G# are<br/>both slightly less impure than in Pythagorean tuning, while Ab-Eb and<br/>C#-G# are each about 4 cents wide. Here I would agree with Lindley<br/>that Schlick calls for Ab-C to be decidedly more serviceable as a<br/>sustained 16th-century concord than E-G#, and for C#-Ab/G# to be<br/>much more marginal than Ab-Eb. At the same time, even while accepting<br/>Lindley&apos;s parameters as appealing, I would agree with Barbour&apos;s<br/>interpretation of a kind of well-temperament, albeit more tentative<br/>and &quot;ragged at the edges&quot; than the one he postulates.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=27154 href="#27154">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2001 5:13:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: mschulter &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 16, 2001 10:54 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Arnold Schlick&apos;s well-temperament of 1511<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, Herbert Anton Kellner and everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your question about the organ temperament published by<br/>&gt; Arnold Schlick in 1511, which gives me the opportunity to address a<br/>&gt; period of music with which I am more familiar. Your inquiry has moved<br/>&gt; me to suggest one possible interpretation of this tuning as a kind of<br/>&gt; well-temperament, reflecting some features of musical style in early<br/>&gt; 16th-century Europe (the era of such composers as Josquin in his later<br/>&gt; years, Isaac, and Senfl).</p><p>Thank you, Margo, for this wonderful detailed post about Schlick&apos;s<br/>tuning methods.  I had promised several weeks ago to write something<br/>here about it, but now you&apos;ve done it for me... your interpretation<br/>agrees very much with what I would have said.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=27159 href="#27159">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2001 3:30:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Monz, and wherever you&apos;re posting from, it&apos;s a delight<br/>to see you here.</p><p>Thanks for your response on Schlick&apos;s temperament, and it&apos;s<br/>interesting that we reached similar conclusions.
