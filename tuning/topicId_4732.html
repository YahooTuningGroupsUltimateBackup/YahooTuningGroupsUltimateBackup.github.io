However, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; almost positive I&apos;ve heard 24tET electric guitars in Arabic or<br/>Persian pop<br/>&gt; music, does anyone know of any evidence?</p><p>The films I have seen of Mohammed Abdel Wahab&apos;s (the Ennio Morricone<br/>of Egypt) ensembles used standard 12TET guitars, but it&apos;s not beyond<br/>belief that 24TET guitars are in use there, but certainly we are<br/>mostly talking about Arabic pop music (i.e popular bellydance) which<br/>tends to look for hybrid west/east forms. All the groups I&apos;ve seen<br/>will use standard electrics but use modes which approximate maqam<br/>rows, emphasizing minor seconds and minor thirds with bends. If a<br/>performer/composer needs more than 12TET, they would probably use an<br/>&apos;ud.</p><p>--<br/>Leigh Smith                 <a href="mailto:leigh@tomandandy.com">leigh@tomandandy.com</a> (MIME)<br/>tomandandy                  +1-212-334-0421 (W) +1-212-334-0422 (F)<br/>                            89 Greene St. New York, NY 10012, USA<br/>                            <a href="http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~leigh">http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~leigh</a><br/>Microsoft - What do you want to re-install today?</p></div>
