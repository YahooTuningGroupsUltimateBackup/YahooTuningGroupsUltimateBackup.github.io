Can&apos;t remember the Volume but it has been within the last 5 years. Repp recapitulated the predictions in a &quot;cross-cultural&quot; study in the Netherlands compared to the results found in the USA.<br/>Result: No empricial verification of Deutsch&apos;s Hypothesis of cultural diffferences indluencing the direction of listening. I guess her explanation is no longer valid.</p><p>Reinhard</p></div>
