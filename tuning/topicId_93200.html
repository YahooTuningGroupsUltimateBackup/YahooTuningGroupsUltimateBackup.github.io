The frets are moveable, you simply scootch them to where you want. They come in all sizes from tiny to huge, and the instruments are very light, nice for travelling. They&apos;re plenty loud but if you need amplification, a stick-on piezo works very well. .</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mark&quot; &lt;mark.barnes3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I also posted this on Make Micro Music.
