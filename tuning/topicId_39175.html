I bought Dewey&apos;s book on Cycles back in the 60s and it became<br/>my bible.  I loved looking through his lists of identical recurring<br/>events like floods and famines.  What  could be more pertinent to<br/>life.  A theory that says you might be able to predict the future?<br/>...I find topics like cycles and vibrations fascinating. Especially<br/>as a former percussionist.  Just because a cycle slows out of the<br/>tonal range doesn&apos;t make it less relevant to music.  And by analogy<br/>something slowed  down so that it is completely out of the audible<br/>range still retains,  for me, musical interest.  In fact, just the<br/>before your message was posted, I was trying to explain my music in<br/>terms of astronomy and your email just came along to prove my point.<br/>I loved it!  Thanks for your expertise, Rick&quot;</p><p>Ok, I will try.  One member and I are into this off-list already,<br/>and in essence I offered this to him and will offer this to the<br/>Tuning List.</p><p>Looking at part of my data below, what stands out for a musician,<br/>looking at the proportions of the system?  Are they octaves?<br/>Are they whole notes?  Although I recognize the system is round,<br/>and I am guessing that musical scales are linear, what does a<br/>musician note when certain planets (notes) defy the doubling or<br/>halving sequence which seems octaval and caused Pythagoras and Kepler<br/>and other astronomers to relate the then perceived system to music?<br/>Since then we have more data, because back then they only observed up<br/>to Uranus.</p><p>If it is not TOO off-topic, why not chime in [pun intended] and talk<br/>about what you see in the data.  I see it more mathematically as a<br/>doubling sequence, out and in, in and out.  Do musical scales work<br/>that way?  I have played around with a piano and do note that the<br/>octaves are set distances away from each other.  Is musical notation<br/>man created, or is the system of notes IN the universe system as the<br/>planets seem to be?  Am I making myself understood to musicians?</p><p>A neat question might be: who TUNED the solar-planetary system?  And,<br/>is it TUNED?  Are there dissonant notes in the scale?  Is it a scale?<br/> Or what do you call it, looking at the numbers?  If it is out of<br/>TUNE, what would make it in TUNE?  Off-list, we did discuss the shift<br/>in numbers from EVEN to ODD at various places.  What are list members<br/>thoughts?</p><p>I published Arnold&apos;s Law in 1979, as follows:</p><p>Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal Mean**<br/>       Or Perimeter</p><p>Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles<br/>Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28<br/>Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42<br/>Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56<br/>Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12<br/>Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24<br/>Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49<br/>Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74<br/>Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99</p><p>*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;</p><p>**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet</p><p>The sun is at 0, where it belongs in a sun-centered system.
