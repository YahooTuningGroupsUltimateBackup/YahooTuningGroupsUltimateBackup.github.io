I have learned a lot about<br/>tunings and scales from this list, but have often wondered how such knowledge<br/>leads to the goal (a primitive one) of music, which is to promote syngery.</p><p>Anyway, if I were to do this research I would begin by defining a range of human<br/>emotional states, examine traditional and contemporary music to determine<br/>musical attributes (progressions, tunings, etc) that are associated with each<br/>emotional state. This knowledge would enable one to be a better musician.  I<br/>think this study must be done on a ehtnic/cultural basis, since one shoe doesn&apos;t<br/>fit all.</p><p>Interestingly, this information for the most part is second nature in musicians<br/>who receive their musical experience and training in their cultural setting.<br/>They know how to play the music to achieve a synergy between musician and<br/>audience. It&apos;s becoming increasing more common to see Blacks, who was raised in<br/>integrated neighborhoods and received their musical training in European<br/>classical music, trying to play gospel music. Their playing is technically<br/>superb but the music lacks that required to inspired the audience. President<br/>Clinton could do better!!</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From:     <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a> at Internet<br/>Sent:     Tuesday, February 02, 1999 2:18 PM<br/>To:     <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a> at internet<br/>Subject:     [tuning] Pure Tuning</p><p>From: &quot;Brian Carlson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bxcarl3@uswest.com">bxcarl3@uswest.com</a>&gt;</p><p>Can anyone explain how one&apos;s physical body and mind are actually physically<br/>affected by pure tuning?

If the short and also longer term psychological effects of music on<br/>listeners were appreciably affected by the tuning of the music, this is<br/>something<br/>having considerable social importance for peoples&apos; overall well being, just as<br/>air quality, control of noise levels, etc. have over time become recognized as<br/>mattering a great deal to people&apos;s well being.</p><p>&#x9;I have made initial efforts to learn about both quantitative &quot;prefer A/prefer<br/>B&quot;<br/>reactions of people (about 300 high schoolers and music school entrants in the<br/>last<br/>two years) and also patterns of peoples&apos; descriptions in their own words<br/>regarding<br/>how differences in tuning impress them or affect them.  I haven&apos;t fully<br/>analyzed<br/>this data yet.  There are certain trends, and there seem to be surprisingly<br/>great<br/>differences between individuals.  Frequently, however, although two<br/>individuals<br/>might differ as to their preferences between an EQT and a mean tone or just<br/>intonation performance of a musical phrase, they will agree on many matters<br/>regarding the different impressions made by the different versions.</p><p>&#x9;Although what people are used to hearing seems to have a big influence on<br/>their<br/>preferences, this is very clearly not the only operative factor.</p><p>&#x9;There are intriguing reports about effects of periods of listening to various<br/>kinds of music prior to taking some kind of test of mental acuity.  I believe<br/>that<br/>it is true that there are significant effects, but it is only too easy to take<br/>a few<br/>observations and draw conclusions from them which are not solidly justified,<br/>and<br/>a lot more careful work needs to be done.</p><p>&#x9;I believe some work has been done towards measuring brain electrical<br/>responses to various kinds of music - as is being done in many areas besides<br/>music<br/>as well.</p><p>&#x9;But there&apos;s a lot which is still uncertain.</p><p>&#x9;I have seen people remark that piano music in mean tone temperament or just<br/>intonation sounds absolutely beautiful to them - perhaps a third of people<br/>respond<br/>this way, which is quite a high proportion considering the great diversity in<br/>musical tastes which exists.</p><p>Dave Hill      La Mesa, CA</p></div>
