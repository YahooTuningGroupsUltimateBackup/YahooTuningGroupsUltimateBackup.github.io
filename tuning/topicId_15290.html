A small and simple post, just before I leave Paris to fly to<br/>New York.</p><p>Next saturday I&apos;ll participate on the AFMM Microthon to  play the first<br/>performance of Joe Pehrson&apos;s &apos;Just in Time&apos;, specially written for my guitar<br/>with moveable frets. Since some of you will assist on this concert, it might<br/>be interesting to describe the tuning used for this piece. It&apos;s based upon<br/>an idea I had when reading Helmholtz for the first time.</p><p>The tuning of the open strings is:</p><p>D-51, G, D-51, G,  C-2, F-4</p><p>The frets are set as follows:</p><p>There is one row of eleven harmonics, starting on the fifth string (tuned as<br/>a low G), going up until a high C+51, exactly eleven times the frequency of<br/>the low G. Then there is one row of subharmonics, starting on a high G<br/>(three octaves above the open fifth string), going down until D-51 (the open<br/>sixth string), exactly eleven times lower than the high G. The rows cross<br/>each other in  a central octave from G to G. I brought all the pitches<br/>together into this octave. The result is a fingerboard with frets all over,<br/>but without any straight line between the frets.</p><p>Last year I showed the tuning to Joe Pehrson and he was immediately inspired<br/>to use it for his new piece. It&apos;s a very elementary idea and I think, while<br/>listening it&apos;s quite well possible to hear what this tuning is about.</p><p>On the first part of the concert I&apos;ll play some pieces by Ivor Darreg and<br/>Neil Haverstick in 19-tet, on the same guitar. Setting he frets from 19-tet<br/>into the JI setting for &apos;Just in Time&apos; will take me at least one hour. I<br/>hope I can make it!</p><p>Looking forward seeing some of you on saturday.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
