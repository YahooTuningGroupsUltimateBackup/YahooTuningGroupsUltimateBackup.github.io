Of course, that&apos;s the fault of the schools and their curriculums; tuning should be an everyday part of musical training, I feel. Maybe folks like us will help change that. Of course, the good thing is that a great musician doesn&apos;t have to know anything about tuning theories to make great music. It&apos;s certainly an interesting field of study, but absolutely unnecessary for the actual making of music.<br/>   I read a quote about tuning from Ross Duffin&apos;s book &quot;How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony&quot; that I also like: &quot;One must remember that the voluminous literature about tuning systems in the past comes from people who were of no musical importance.&quot; (P. 15) Good point; theory and reality in art are often unrelated. It&apos;s the artists that make the art, and those that don&apos;t make any significant contribution to art can certainly talk ABOUT great art/artists, but it isn&apos;t the same thing. Artists will go about playing music, painting, dancing, whatever, whether or not anybody ever writes about what they do...best...Hstick  (PS...and of course, there are certainly a few great artists who also know their tuning theory)<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p></div>
