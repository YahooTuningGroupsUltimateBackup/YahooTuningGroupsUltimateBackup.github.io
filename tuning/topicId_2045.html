Doty, the Just Intonation Network, and _1/1_.</p><p>In a world where people seek new musical experiences and ideas,<br/>including the renewing experience of _old_ music performed with new<br/>(or once-forgetten) insights, JIN performs an invaluable service not<br/>only by presenting a powerful artistic philosophy, but by its example<br/>inviting others to explore a range of approaches to tuning,<br/>composition, and interpretation.</p><p>One unfortunate temptation in the alternate tuning world is to take<br/>each possibility as negating all the others: thus Pythagorean<br/>vs. meantone, or JI vs. n-tet, etc. Actually, however, it seems to me<br/>that the possibilities are not subtractive but additive, even<br/>multiplicative, although one publication can only cover so much of the<br/>ground.</p><p>For me, the quality of _1/1_ was demonstrated when I discovered on the<br/>Internet a text reprint of a distinguished article by Bill Alves on<br/>&quot;The Just Intonation System of Nicola Vicentino,&quot; _1/1, Journal of the<br/>Just Intonation Network_, 5, No. 2 (Spring 1989), 8-13.</p><p>Does the value of _1/1_ mean that other approaches such as meantone or<br/>n-tet are any less valid? Of course not. In fact, Vicentino&apos;s own<br/>system and instrument design of 1555 might illustrate this point: his<br/>36-note archicembalo is evidently tuned mainly around 1/4-comma<br/>meantone or 31-tone equal temperament, but with much allusion to just<br/>intonation theory and also some extra keys to provide just 3:2 fifths<br/>above certain notes.</p><p>To look at things another way: does or should the validity, as I see<br/>it, of many approaches to tuning, in any way discourage _1/1_ from<br/>expressing its own unique viewpoint and artistic vision? Again, I<br/>would say, of course not!</p><p>As I&apos;ve often discussed here from a Pythagorean perspective, &quot;just<br/>intonation&quot; alone (not to mention other approaches) can imply a wide<br/>diversity of viewpoints. It is within the editorial discretion of<br/>_1/1_ to decide which portions of this vast territory seem to fit its<br/>specific scope of interest.</p><p>As we approach a new millennium, it seems to me that committed and<br/>distinctive voices in the tuning world are a precious gift to all of<br/>us, whether we agree, disagree, or simply happen to follow some other<br/>approach.</p><p>Both as an editor and advocate who provides (along with the<br/>contributors to _1/1_) such a voice, and as a member of the alternate<br/>tuning community who has shown me his knowledge and generosity, David<br/>B. Doty well merits the appreciation of our community.</p><p>As I see it, incidentally, one way to express such appreciation is for<br/>those of us following other approaches to strive to be equally<br/>creative and helpful in sharing and advancing these alternatives also.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
