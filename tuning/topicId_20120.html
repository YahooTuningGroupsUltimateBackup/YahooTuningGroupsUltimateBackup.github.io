were &quot;broken&quot; to provide<br/>additional keys.<br/>Occasionally notes outside this range also were broken, in the treble<br/>only eb&apos;&apos;/d#&apos;&apos; (more frequent) and g#&apos;&apos;/ab&apos;&apos; (less frequent) and in the<br/>bass G#/Ab and Bb/A# occur, but very seldom (s. chapter &quot;A Very Short History&quot;).<br/>Split keys for any f#/gb, in whatsoever octave, are until now not known.</p><p>Split Key Design</p><p>A keyboard may look like this from above:</p><p>ordinary keyboard         keyboard where eb<br/>without split key             is &quot;split&quot;</p><p>      back                       back</p><p>    |       |                  | |     |<br/>    |       |                  | |     |<br/>    |       |                  | |     |<br/>    |       |                  | |     |<br/>    |       |                  | |     |<br/>    |       |                  | |     |<br/>    |       |                  | |  d# |<br/>|   |       |   |          |   | |_____|   |   ___<br/>|   |       |   |          |   |       |   |    |<br/>|   |       |   |          |   |       |   |    |<br/>|   |   eb  |   |          |   |  eb   |   |    |<br/>|   |_______|   |          |   |_______|   |   _|_<br/>|       |       |          |       |       |<br/>|       |       |          |       |       |<br/>|       |       |          |       |       |<br/>|  d    |   e   |          |   d   |   e   |<br/>|_______|_______|          |_______|_______|</p><p>      front                      front</p><p>In a few preserved keyboards in organ positives by the Manderscheidt<br/>family (s. in chapter &quot;A Very Short History&quot;) the front part of the<br/>*lower  upper key (eb) might be ca. 2 cm long (+/-2-3 mm)<br/>- the distance being indicated by the vertical line to the right in the drawing.</p><p>Viewed from the front a section will look like</p><p>                                  _____<br/>                                 /     \<br/>                                 | d#  |<br/>     _______                    _|_____|<br/>    /       \                  / :     \<br/>    |  eb   |                  | : eb  |<br/> ___|_______|___           ____|_______|____<br/>|   :_ _|_ _:   |         |    :_:_|_ _:    |<br/>|       |       |         |        |        |<br/>|  d    |   e   |         |    d   |    e   |<br/>|_______|_______|         |________|________|</p><p>And in 3-D:<br/>a keyboard seen from the right</p><p>                         /    /<br/>                        /    /<br/>                       /    /<br/>                      /    /     /<br/>                     / d# /     /       /<br/>                    /____/     /       /<br/>     /              |    |    /       /   /      /<br/>    /          /   /|    |   /       /   /      /<br/>   /   /      /   / |____|  /       /   /      /<br/>  /   /      /   /      /| /       /   /      /<br/> /   / c#   /   /  eb  / |/       /   /  f#  /<br/>/   /_____ /   /_____ /  /       /   /_____ /<br/>    |     |    |     |  /       /    |     |  /<br/>    |     | /  |     | /       /     |     | /<br/>    |_____|/   |_____|/       /      |_____|/<br/>       /          /          /          /<br/>      /          /          /          /<br/> c   /    d     /    e     /    f     /    g<br/> ___/__________/__________/__________/__________<br/>    |          |          |          |<br/>    |          |          |          |<br/>    |          |          |          |<br/> ___|__________|__________|__________|____</p><p>Designs for g#/ab etc. would be similar.</p><p>Added Keys or Split Keys in Pythagorean Tuning</p><p>The pythagorean chain of perfect pure fifths</p><p>Gb- Db- Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E - B</p><p>provides us with the four notes Gb- Db- Ab- Eb, which work as major<br/>thirds (F#- C#- G#- D#) to some of the main keys of the modal system.<br/>These major thirds are so close to pure, that they result practically in<br/>a cut-out of Just Intonation where the diatonic notes (or better, the<br/>notes from the old hexachord-system - therefore including both B and Bb)<br/>get major thirds which are only the small amount of 1,9 cents, the so<br/>called schisma (s. below), lower than pure.</p><p>The scheme</p><p>ex. 1                   Gb- Db- Ab- Eb- ...<br/>                       / \ / \ / \/<br/>   ...Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E - B</p><p>     is therefore practically the same as:</p><p>ex. 2                   F#- C#- G#- D#- ...<br/>                       / \ / \ / \/<br/>   ...Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E - B</p><p>as which it might have originated once - adding pure major thirds to the<br/>most used diatonic notes.</p><p>The chain of pure perfect fifths from</p><p>Cb- Gb- Db- Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>   results like the previous ex. 1 in practice in:</p><p> ex. 3                 B - F#- C#- G#-(Eb- Bb- F - C)<br/>                      / \ / \ / \ /<br/> ...

Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A</p><p>The upper rows, for example B - F#- C#- G# in ex. 3. turn out to be<br/>major thirds, which are only a very small amount, the so-called schisma,<br/>lower than pure (s. below for an explanation).</p><p>E - B  in ex. 1 and  A - E  in ex. 2. can not be pure fifths:<br/>The fifth E - B in ex. 3, is in fact not a perfect (impure) fifth, but<br/>a pythagorean diminuished sixth E - Cb, and is a syntonic comma below<br/>the pure fifth, because this E is higher than the pure major third to C.</p><p>In the following ex. 5 the pure E (pure major third to C) indicated by a &apos;<br/>E in this example is generated by four pure perfect fifths - it is<br/>audible higher than pure.</p><p> ex. 5    E&apos;<br/>         /<br/>        C - G - D - A - E</p><p>The difference between those two E-s is called the syntonic comma (s. Appendix)</p><p>Another way to show what happens is to combine the chain of fifths and<br/>the pure major third</p><p> ex. 6                            E&apos;<br/>                                 /<br/>Fb- Cb- Gb- Db- Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>Fb is only slightly below the E&apos; which serves as pure major third to C.<br/>For practical reasons we can say that  Fb = E&apos;</p><p>I call those intervalls, actually  pythagorean diminuished fourths<br/>(C-Fb in our previous example), which are practically pure major thirds<br/>(very close to C-E&apos;) &quot;schismatic thirds&quot;</p><p>Especially in an organ the &quot;pulling-effect&quot; (&quot;drawing together&quot;) might<br/>render these &quot;schismatic thirds&quot; pure to the listener. And it is not<br/>unlikely, that pythagorean tuning might have been derived not from the<br/>chain of fifths, but from the diatonic notes, which got pure major<br/>thirds added ...</p><p>Because of this difference another E , pure to C, might have been<br/>inserted on a keyboard of a pythagorean tuned organ.</p><p>There are hints provided by Christopher Stembridge and L. F. Tagliavini,<br/>that extra keys were actually already used in organs tuned in<br/>pythagorean tuning in the middle of the 15th century, but at the same<br/>time meantone temperament rose and lead to a greater interest in adding<br/>the &quot;tasti spezzati&quot; or &quot;subsemitonia&quot;.</p><p>The pythagorean example given by Stembridge and Tagliavini is from an<br/>intarsia showing an extra key between E and F.</p><p>In ex. 3 there is only the E, therefore an E&apos; might have been inserted<br/>as extra key.</p><p>In ex. 4 there is the E&apos; already there (in the upper row), and E might<br/>have been added to the lower row to make the pure chord e-g#-b available.</p><p>The split key between E and F would add either the E above C (to ex. 3)</p><p>  ex. 7         E - B - F#- C#- G#<br/>               / \ / \ / \ / \ /<br/>  Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>or the pure fifth E to A (ex. 4)</p><p>  ex. 8             E - B - F#- C#<br/>                   / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>  Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>It might be that there have been other keys added in other instruments,<br/>depending on the resp. chain of fifths and the total number of keys. But<br/>this remains speculative until we&apos;ll know of documents...</p><p>Meantone Extension</p><p>In an italian organ around 1500 (4 examples known before 1500), tuned in<br/>a meantone temperament, the first key to be split might be the a-flat,<br/>provided with the g# (as back key) - as can be seen in the<br/>(reconstructed) keyboards of the 2 famous organs in Bologna, Italy, S.<br/>Petronio, the older one from 1475, getting split keys during the rebuilt<br/>by G. B. Facchetti in 1528-1531 and the other organ from 1596 built by<br/>B. Malamini.<br/>Others started with doubling eb/d#.</p><p>Later it became usual to split consequently: eb/d#, g#/ab (g# being in<br/>front), bb/a# then c#/db (seldom). There are only two organs known which<br/>had all these 4 split sharps and in both cases all concentrated in one<br/>octave span:<br/>Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel, Germany, Hauptkirche BMV, 1620-1624 G. Fritzsche,  and<br/>Sciacca, Italy, S. Margherita, 1639 G. Sutera and V. Monteleone</p><p>Not one known organ with less than 19 notes per octave (the &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>instruments) had *all five split keys (or more) as subsemitones.</p><p>The pattern with eb/d# and g#/ab (14 notes/pitches per octave) seems to<br/>have been frequent. It provides the following possibilities,<br/>symmetrically ordered around the fifth of the 1st mode D-A.</p><p>ex. 5     ~~G#~~D#<br/>         \ / \ / \<br/>        ~~E~~~B~~~F#~~C#~~G#~~D#<br/>       \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>      ~~C~~~G~~~D~~~A~~~E~~~B~~<br/>     \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>      Ab~~Eb~~Bb~~F~~~C~~~G~~<br/>                   \ / \ / \<br/>                    Ab~~Eb~~</p><p>    dashes and slashes indicate here<br/>    ~~ meantone fifths<br/>    /  pure major thirds<br/>    \  minor thirds (as defined by the two previous)</p><p>&quot;wavy&quot; lines (~~) and slashes with resp. &quot;open end&quot; indicate<br/>continuation in the next row below or above.

F-keyboards could have been<br/>actually based on D (same pattern, but without the C).</p><p>How important the symmetrical aspect might have been regarded, is<br/>difficult to say. Amazing is in this respect that keyboards until<br/>ca. 1700 were rather equipped with extra notes in the bass for F# and<br/>G#, built as split keys (but which are not &quot;subsemitones&quot;) as well:</p><p>      F#  G#<br/>      D   E   Bb<br/>C   F   G   A   B   c</p><p>There are a few keyboard designs, deviating from the above sketched<br/>patterns, apparently &quot;omitting&quot; certain keys, like doubling<br/>eb/d# and bb/a#, leaving out the frequent g#/ab), or providing<br/>g#/ab and c#/db , but not eb/d#<br/>whichs possible purpose is explained below.</p><p>Terminology</p><p>The &quot;lattice&quot; diagrams above are used as a &quot;informal&quot; way to show the<br/>symmetry of meantone and the central key d, resp. the fifth D - A is<br/>also the fundament of the most &quot;popular&quot; pythagorean tuning &quot;Gb&quot;-H ...<br/>Interesting that the organ builders kept until the 20th century the<br/>nomenclature of the pythagorean tuning, saying &quot;d#&quot; even when a &quot;real&quot;<br/>eb is tuned. This also was the standard in the so-called &quot;new German<br/>organ-tablature&quot; in the 17th century. This was a notation in which notes<br/>were expressed by letters and extra signs for rhythms (s. J. G. Walthers<br/>&quot;Musicalisches Lexicon&quot;, table XXI) also stayed with this standard.<br/>A c-minor-triad would be notated in a keyboard tablature or tablature<br/>score of the 17th century &quot;c  ds  g&quot;, an Eb-major-triad &quot;d# g b&quot;<br/>(&quot;b&quot; indicating here b-flat in the German way - remember B-A-C-H...).</p><p>The added split keys keys were marked in the Fritzsche- and<br/>Manderscheidt-tradition with an &quot;#&quot; on the pipes (and in contracts):</p><p> name   sounding<br/>          note</p><p> ds       eb<br/> ds#      d#<br/> --------------------<br/> gs       g#<br/> gs#      ab</p><p>This can be found for example in the specification-draft from 1612 by<br/>Hans Leo Hassler for the future organ in the castle chapel of the<br/>electoral court in Dresden, completed by Gottfried Fritzsche probably<br/>end of 1612.  A facsimile of this important document is easily<br/>accessible in Gress 1993 (p. 76-77, transcription p. 102-103).</p><p>A report from Breslau/Wroclaw, that the organ in Stiftskirche St.<br/>Vincenz, built in the 1660ies by J.C.B. Waldhauser mentions &quot;dis&quot; (eb)<br/>and &quot;dass&quot; (d#).</p><p>Michael Praetorius (&quot;De organographia&quot;, 1619) wrote however (only here?)<br/>&quot;es&quot; and &quot;ds&quot;, &quot;gs&quot; and &quot;as&quot;.</p><p>A Very Short History</p><p>It seems to have been Italian organ builders of the mid-15th-C. who were<br/>the first to apply split keys in organ building. Not surprising Italy<br/>was the main center of this development for the first 150 years and<br/>nearly half of the instruments we know of today are to be found in this<br/>country. Until 1600 we leran about 19 organs. From Italy the idea might<br/>have spread to Spain (the picture within Spain still remains somewhat unclear).</p><p>In Italy the development seems to faded out after 1660, but shortly<br/>after 1600 however, Germany, which was dominated by musicians under<br/>Italian influence, took a central position. Split keys were promoted by<br/>the leader of the Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel court chapel, Michael Praetorius, and the<br/>Saxon court organ builder Gottfried Fritzsche. Other promoters were f.<br/>example Henrich Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;tz (Dresden) and Jacob Praetorius (Hamburg), both<br/>knowing and cooperating with each other and with Fritzsche. Dresden was<br/>the first organ norther of the alps in which split keys were applied<br/>(Schlick 1511 reports a failed attempt at an unknown place by two<br/>unknown builders). The chapel organ was finished by G. Fritzsche in 1612<br/>after having planned it together with Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;tz&apos; predecessor as chapel<br/>master of the electoral court, Hans Leo Hassler. It is hoped by the way<br/>that in the near future this organ will be reconstructed in the as well<br/>reconstructed Dresden castle.</p><p>The Manderscheidt-family originally working in and around N&iuml;&iquest;&half;rnberg<br/>(Nuremberg) has to be mentioned too, because they produced several<br/>positives, but also bigger church organs like the recently restored<br/>choir organ in Fribourg, Switzerland, St. Nicolas, built 1654-1657 by<br/>Sebald Manderscheidt.</p><p>&gt;From these geographical area the idea spread further to surrounding<br/>regions and countries:</p><p>- Denmark:         only one example known, probably an organ builder<br/>                   of Saxon origin (the courts of Denmark and saxony<br/>                   were dynastically linked)</p><p>- Sweden:          the only country where also local organ builders<br/>                   took the practice over.</p><p>- the Netherlands: the northwest-German organ builder family<br/>                   van Hagerbeer (1630ies/1640ies)</p><p>- Switzerland:     Manderscheidt-family (s. above) ca. 1650</p><p>- England:         2 organs known, by Bernard Smith (Bernhard Schmidt)<br/>                   in the 1680ies</p><p>In France this tradition did not prevail, as far as we know today. There<br/>is no safe evidence for any organ with split keys and the Gamba-player<br/>Jean-Jaques Rousseau confirmed in 1697 that this tradition was not to be<br/>found in France, contrary to Italy. Even the only example in Paris, St.<br/>Nicolas des Champs, 1632-1636, C. Carlier, is not known whether it was<br/>at all realized or only a contract or draft, not carried out later.</p><p>At the end of the 17th century there are still large organs built with 3<br/>manuals and pedal in Sweden and Germany, which contained 3 split<br/>keys/octave, namely eb/d#, g#/ab and bb/a#, sometimes even going down<br/>below c: Bb/A# occurs in a few cases. Split keys below c were otherwise<br/>only to be found in some Italian early compasses, but those where<br/>keyboards extended down to FF - 12-foot-organs thus.</p><p>With the rise of circulating temperaments the practice disappeared in<br/>organ building soon after 1700. The last organ was built by J. and V. F.<br/>Bossart in 1716-1721 in Luzern (Switzerland), St. Urban.</p><p>The history of piano&apos;s with less than 19 keys/octave is not well known.<br/>Broadwood is reported to have built a piano in 1766 which had all upper<br/>keys split.</p><p>About 70 organs with 13-16 keys per octave are known today to have been<br/>built during the time sketched above. This is however very likely only<br/>the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; and a closer look to literare and archives<br/>might reveal many more examples.</p><p>The historical informed performance practice movement lead organ<br/>builders to build organs in meantone tuning again and so the split keys<br/>came back into modern organ building.</p><p>With the return of historical oriented organ building and the rise of<br/>historical temperaments and tunings in the practice of instrument<br/>building and performance practice split keys have become a more and more<br/>frequent feature again since the 1970ies, after an interlude of nearly<br/>300 years. Italy, the USA, Sweden and Switzerland might be today the<br/>countries with the highest concentration of existing organs with split<br/>keys, while the development in other traditional organ countries like<br/>the Netherlands or Germany has not yet led to a more frequent re-use again.</p><p>Use</p><p>Split keys could be used in several ways and circumstances: Continuo<br/>practice, intonation aid, &quot;fancy pieces&quot;, etc.<br/>Transposition could well be the most important reason for their<br/>existence. Transposition to a variety of intervals was frequent and<br/>necessary:  The organist had to provide the proper tones in the liturgy,<br/>to play transcriptions (intabulations) in different applied pitches and<br/>to accompany ensembles.</p><p>Special designs were developed, which made only sense in transposition,<br/>for example by apparently &quot;omitting&quot; certain keys, to enable comfortable<br/>transposition by certain intervals. This might for example reflect the<br/>relative low or high organ pitch in the respective region.</p><p>Another organ (S&iuml;&iquest;&half;nderborg Slotskapel, 1626, rebuilt by B. (Zencker [?])<br/>and restored recently by Mads Kjersgaard) even has two manuals, one of<br/>them with split keys, that shows some similarity to the concept of the<br/>so-called &iuml;&iquest;&half;transposing&quot; instruments by the German/Flemish harpsichord<br/>builders Ruckers.<br/>Designs in other organs lead to the conclusion that their split keys<br/>were used mainly in continuo-playing (Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel, and<br/>maybe, Sciacca).</p><p>Selected literature:</p><p>Burgemeister, Ludwig.

Since<br/>Ibo said he thought there weren&apos;t split keyboards in France until quite a<br/>few years later than that, I thought people might be interested to see<br/>these diagrams. I scanned them and put them in the files area of<br/>yahoogroups, but the feature to create a new folder wasn&apos;t working, so I<br/>put them somewhere kind of random. They are here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/terrain/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/terrain/</a></p><p>called mers16, mers18, mers31 etc. according to the number of keys per<br/>octave in each arrangement. There is some tuning information on the<br/>diagrams; I put a small read-me file there too.</p><p>Ibo, you probably know these diagrams already and have some reason for<br/>thinking they were only theory, and that no organs actually existed in<br/>France like this? Mersenne seems very knowledgable about organ<br/>construction, and that part of the treatise is surely based on experience.</p><p>By the way, did you know the Swedish composer Bengt Hambreus? - he had a<br/>great love and knowledge of historical organ design, and he oversaw the<br/>construction of a beautiful replica baroque organ in Montreal. I studied<br/>composition with him there for a couple of years, and he taught me lots<br/>about the organ.</p><p>Best wishes --Jon</p></div><h3>Joe Monzo, monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2001 1:18:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20144">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20144</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Say what you want about big institutions - they have great<br/>&gt; libraries.</p><p>Amen!
