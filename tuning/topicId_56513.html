I installed a basic component of the Ultra-tonal piano just tonight in my worn-out practice piano in the attic, (although a very primitive arrangement with steel wire, nails and a long stick to gain support from the back wall) I eventually succeeded in bending a string as high as a half-tone with a single movement of my arm in what sounded like a smooth, fast and controlled glissando effect. I found this so exciting I wished to inform you folks straightaway. The possibilities seem endless, it looks like we will be able to manufacture the Ultratonal Piano very soon. Stay on the alert.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman</p><p>P.S. Dear John, thank you for the link and Merry Christmas!</p><p>P.S.2 Dear Werner, I shall respond to your mail when I take care of a few details here. Merry Christmas to you and to your family.</p><p>P.S.3 Dear George, I will prepare my reply soon, Merry Christmas to all!</p></div>
