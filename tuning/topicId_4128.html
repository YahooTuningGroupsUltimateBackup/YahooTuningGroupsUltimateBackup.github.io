I had been working with synths<br/>but still didn&apos;t feel connected with the harmonic<br/>series.</p><p>Recently I purchased a fretless bass so I could<br/>have more control over the tuning. If I can find<br/>a ratio on the fingerboard, I&apos;m making progress.<br/>Generally I try to practice with a sine drone,<br/>better to hear the intervals.</p><p>One of the lower harmonics I have problems<br/>finding is 13. When I was playing slide guitar,<br/>I could never find 13. I&apos;d slide around but I<br/>could never find a spot on the string where it<br/>*felt* right.</p><p>Ah...but a few days ago I was playing bass with an Eb drone<br/>when I found it. I quickly set up a second drone<br/>using the 13th harmonic and was pleased to find<br/>that I could easily find it on the bass. Maybe<br/>there&apos;s something about the construction of the<br/>instrument - resonance? - that makes it easier to find.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
