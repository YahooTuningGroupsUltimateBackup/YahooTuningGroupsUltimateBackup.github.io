I don&apos;t have any books that go over the maqam tradition in much detail -- a brief summary of the Persian _dastgah_ system in William P. Malm&apos;s _Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia_, but there have been some web site links posted recently in this group that may be relevant. <a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/">http://www.maqamworld.com/</a> is the main one that comes to mind, although the maqamat are notated as quarter-tones. Others here may have some better sources. Malm&apos;s book also goes over the basics of the Indian shruti system, but I know I&apos;ve seen more detail in other sources.</p><p>I think the interesting point about the Indonesian scales is not the specific cents values of the intervals (which vary considerably from one place to another), but the practice of detuning two sets of instruments to beat at a specific rate, and the variable detuning of the octaves.</p><p>&gt;&gt; There are mathematical properties relevant to &quot;construction of &gt;&gt; musical scales&quot; that don&apos;t require anything like linear algebra -- &gt;&gt; Myhill&apos;s property for instance is useful to know about (each &gt;&gt; interval class has two different sizes of interval), as is &gt;&gt; Rothenberg&apos;s propriety.
