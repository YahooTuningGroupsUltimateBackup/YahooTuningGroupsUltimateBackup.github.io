It consisted of Robert Schumann Quartet in E flat for<br/>Piano and Strings, Op. 44 and Magnus Lindberg&apos;s &quot;Kraft&quot; for orchestra<br/>and ensemble.</p><p>The program seemed highly unsatisfying to this listener .  From the<br/>opening thin sounding string quartet to the final tutti chords all I<br/>could think about was how much more sound one violin could make playing<br/>blue grass.</p><p>The string quartet amplified the piano&apos;s 12 ET clearly.  I couldn&apos;t<br/>shake the feeling that the 12 ET string intonation was a cop out for<br/>lack of rehersal time.  I didn&apos;t feel any of the passion when a sound<br/>jells.</p><p>There was a lot of gesturing.  Olli Mustonen the pianist  threw his head<br/>and arms at the cadences.  The first violinist also bobbed up and down<br/>which was reassuring from my position on the lawn.  I have a feeling it<br/>might have sounded better from where they were.</p><p>Perhaps I didn&apos;t understand what this piece was doing hogging the first<br/>half of the concert with a whole symphony orchestra sitting in the<br/>wings.  But then, after the orchestra came on stage after intermission,<br/>things didn&apos;t really improve (sonically).</p><p>Kraft occupied the second half of the concert and consisted of a lot of<br/>percussion sounds mixed with electronics and an orchestra imitating<br/>percussion and electronic sounds.  A lot of ponticello, brass<br/>glissandos, bass drum rolls, short tutti bursts, bassoon growling etc.<br/>In other words, very little pitch.  And no pitch for pitch sake.</p><p>The strong point of the piece was its masterful form  The program notes<br/>call Linberg&apos;s compositional technique &quot;cinematic&quot; which was apt.  It&apos;s<br/>use of silence helped because there is always so much ambient noise to<br/>appreciate at an outdoor concert.  Members of the wind and brass<br/>sections of the orchestra and percussionists of the Toimii ensemble<br/>moved into the audience seemed responsive to the environment and the<br/>moment.  The conducting by Esa-Pekka Salonen and playing by both the<br/>Toimii ensemble and the LA Phil were virtuosic.</p><p>The LA Times review by Mark Swed glowed on and on about the concert, the<br/>music and the festival.  I&apos;m glad I went just to see for myself the<br/>straights modern music is in.  Paul Griffith look out.</p><p>RT</p></div>
