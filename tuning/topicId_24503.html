Another<br/>reason why that choice was made is inversions. You can turn a 7 upside down<br/>and it becomes L, which is the inversion of 7. However if you turn 11 upside<br/>down you still have something that looks like 11, or at least very close if<br/>you add little lines on top of your ones and then invert them. So it was<br/>exactly as you said the arrow is well established for 1/4 tones and its also<br/>more clear to invert an arrow and not as clear to invert an 11.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=24572 href="#24572">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/8/2001 2:09:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24503.html#24517">/tuning/topicId_24503.html#24517</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I really think you guys blew it by accepting Sims&apos;s notation<br/>&gt; too readily.

Just the other<br/>day I was going through some of my old music stuff, and noticed that I was<br/>using arrows attached to the standard accidentals for quarter-tones. This<br/>came as a bit of a surprise, since I&apos;ve recently been using them for steps<br/>of 72-equal in conjunction with the Tartini/Fokker accidentals for the<br/>quarter-tones. But since they&apos;re more commonly used for quarter-tones, I&apos;ve<br/>decided that it&apos;s better to avoid them.</p><p>Although I&apos;ve pretty much settled on the Tartini/Fokker accidentals for the<br/>semisharp and semiflat, I&apos;m still experimenting with notations for the<br/>other intervals. One requirement is that whatever symbols I use should be<br/>useful in other tuning systems. I like the + and - for this reason, since<br/>many tuning systems have an interval that can function as a comma. But it<br/>would also be useful to have symbols for 1/6-tone intervals (especially in<br/>Miracle tuning), and the half-arrows seem to be as good as anything else<br/>for representing these intervals. (Single steps of 43- and 50-equal might<br/>also be represented by the same symbols, since three steps add up to a<br/>sharp or flat in those tuning systems.)</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=24602 href="#24602">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/8/2001 8:28:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24503.html#24596">/tuning/topicId_24503.html#24596</a></p><p>&gt; On Fri, 8 Jun 2001 03:22:36 -0700, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Back around May 23, when Dave Keenan started the &quot;ASCII-dental<br/>mess&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;thread, I supported my choice of ^ and v for the 1/4-tones based<br/>&gt; &gt;on the historical precedence of the up- and down-arrows for<br/>&gt; &gt;1/4-tones in musical notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Arrows for quarter-tones seem to be a natural development.</p><p>Oh oh.... thank you very much, Herman, for your &quot;contribution&quot; to<br/>this thread...
