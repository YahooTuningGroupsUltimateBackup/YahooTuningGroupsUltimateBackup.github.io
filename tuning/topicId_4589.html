Will<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s instruments go silent when these musicians grow too<br/>&gt; old to play<br/>&gt; them?</p><p>Drummond&apos;s comment rubbed me the wrong way too, but let me tell you a<br/>story...</p><p>About 3 years ago I contacted Dean Drummond about seeing the Partch<br/>instruments.  I forget why, but I ended up getting 7 people together for a<br/>class in Partch harmony with Mr. Drummond.  We all piled into a minivan and<br/>made the 4 hour trip from Boston to Purchase, NY where the instruments were<br/>then housed for a long Saturday afternoon with the instruments.  He gave<br/>about a very informative hour lecture, then demonstrated each instrument.<br/>After he explained that the instruments were no longer to be &quot;raped&quot; as<br/>Partch had suggested, but must be played lightly and carefully, using the<br/>proper mallets, we were all allowed to go around the room carefully trying<br/>out whatever we liked!  I think we paid $50 each for the afternoon and it<br/>was well worth it!</p><p>He was very open to scheduling time to measure instruments for the purpose<br/>of making copies, and Newband had already commissioned a plastic Boo.<br/>Unfortunately, no recording equipment of any kind was allowed.  Specifically<br/>to avoid sampling of the instruments.  This is a shame as it limits the<br/>performances of Partch&apos;s works.  On the other hand, he is very willing to<br/>allow measurement of Partch&apos;s instruments so that you can make copies of<br/>them for any purpose!</p><p>Over all, I thought he had an excellent attitude for a curator.  Very<br/>careful with the instruments, yet willing to share them with those obviously<br/>interested.  Since no major institution with deep pockets has yet provided<br/>proper housing and funding for this national treasure.  (Even the latest<br/>mentioned having the instruments in 3 separate rooms!)  This task has<br/>required enormous babysitting on Mr. Drummond&apos;s part, including multiple<br/>moves, etc.  If he needs to limit sampling of the instruments so that he<br/>keeps a corner on the market of Partch performances, and that keeps a roof<br/>over his head, so be it.</p><p>If you are unhappy with the job he is doing, try to find a better place for<br/>the instruments.  I did a bit of calling and asking around in an attempt to<br/>help Mr. Drummond and got very discouraged.  Better him than me!</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments">http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments</a></p></div>
