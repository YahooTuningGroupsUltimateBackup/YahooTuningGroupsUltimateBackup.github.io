Also, I&apos;m still not finished with that &quot;fragtime&quot; piano thing in 72-edo I&apos;ve been working on, but I&apos;m about two-thirds done now. It&apos;s actually my first major microtonal composition, so I&apos;m experimenting a lot. I spent hours just trying how to deal with a simple I-vi-ii-V progression and work around the &quot;comma pump&quot; problem.</p><p>I&apos;ve been describing blues minor intervals as &quot;minor-in-major&quot;, since they&apos;re otonal in nature, having a 7 in the numerator when expressed as JI. I describe all augmented intervals beginning with the fourth by that color now:</p><p>1. Blue tritone (aug. fourth) = 7/5<br/>2. Blue semitone/minor second (aug. prime) = 21/20 or 28/27*<br/>3. Blue minor sixth (aug. fifth) = 14/9<br/>4. Blue minor third (aug. second) = 7/6<br/>5. Blue minor seventh (aug. sixth) = 7/4<br/>6. Blue lowered fourth (aug. third) = 21/20<br/>7. Blue lowered octave (aug. seventh) = 63/32 or 35/18<br/>*also, &quot;blue&quot; minor ninth (aug. octave) = 21/10 or 56/27</p><p>This applies not only to JI, but extended meantone, Pythagorean, Miracle and so on.</p><p>So what would you call _utonal_ 7-limit intervals, the &quot;major-in-minor&quot; tonalities? Since the complement of the color blue is yellow (in the scientific red-blue-green primary color system) or orange (in the older red-blue-yellow scheme), it could be called either. I&apos;ll split the difference and call these &quot;amber&quot; notes. I also thought of another name, &quot;Sabawi&quot; (Arabic: &#x64F;&#x61F;&#xFFFD;&#x64F;&#x61F;&#xFFFD;&#x64F;&#x61F;&#xFFFD;&#x64F;&#x61F;&#xFFFD;&#x64F;&#x61F;&#xFFFD;), derived from Saba, the maqam that contains a diminished fourth and diminished octave: D Ed F Gb A Bb C Db E F.</p><p>So here are the &quot;amber&quot; (or &quot;Sabawi&quot;) intervals, the octave-complements of the blue notes above:</p><p>1. Amber tritone (dim. fifth) = 10/7<br/>2. Amber major seventh (dim. octave) = 40/21 or 27/14<br/>3. Amber major third (dim. fourth) = 9/7<br/>4. Amber major sixth (dim. seventh) = 12/7<br/>5. Amber tone/major second (dim. third) = 8/7<br/>6. Amber fifth (dim. sixth) = 32/21<br/>7. Amber raised prime (dim. second) = 64/63 or 36/35*<br/>*also, &quot;amber&quot; raised octave (dim. ninth)</p><p>Actually, I&apos;m using six colors - black, red, yellow, white, green and blue/cyan - to describe six successive divisions of an ET semitone in 72-equal. Most of these &quot;blue&quot; notes would actually be mapped to a &quot;green&quot; note, since they&apos;re two moria flat of an unaltered 12-equal pitch (the &quot;blues&quot; tritone is still &quot;blue&quot;).</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3><a id=78015 href="#78015">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2008 9:11:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[ Attachment content not displayed ]</p></div><h3><a id=78016 href="#78016">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2008 1:09:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; Interesting ideas. I like the &apos;amber&apos; terminology. Why do you refer to &gt; 7-limit utonalities as being &quot;major-in-minor&quot;? Usually the sound that &gt; I hear with a major-in-minor tonality is either a simple major third &gt; over the root of a minor chord, as in the chord D F+ B E A D F#- or an &gt; 81/64 wide third, as in the case of the stacked-third chord D F+ A C+ &gt; E G+ B D+ F#.</p><p>A lot of the weird terminology I use out of habit I came up with before I knew the &quot;proper&quot; terminology, so it&apos;s all _ad hoc_. I came up with the phrase &quot;minor-in-major&quot; to refer to the use of minor-like intervals in an overall major tonality, with the minor subordinate to the major. I tend to follow Partch in thinking of otonal ratios and their equivalents as &quot;major&quot; (and &quot;augmented&quot;) while utonal ratios are &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;dminished&quot;. For 7-limit, I calculate otonality/utonality by this formula: for a ratio 3^a * 5^b * 7^c, n = a + 4b + 10c. Or I could just map everything to 31-equal; it&apos;s a quick-and-dirty method.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, I know everyone thinks of blue notes as being 7-limit intervals, &gt; but those are far from the only blue notes they use when playing the &gt; actual blues. They go up to the 11-limit a lot - 11/8 is used quite a &gt; bit, as is 11/9 as a blue third. Good ol&apos; 6/5 is sometimes used for &gt; that minor third as well. Hell, sometimes they&apos;ll even start on 7/6 on &gt; the beginning of a note and bend up to around 5/4 or even 9/7 by the &gt; end of it - which blue note is that? And while 9 times out of ten that &gt; minor 7 is going to be 7/4, they sometimes go even flatter to around &gt; 950 cents, and sometimes go sharper to around 9/5, although the latter &gt; is more common in later, jazz-inspired forms of the blues.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, 11/8 as a tritone would be a &quot;deeper shade of blue&quot; than 7/5. (The prime 11 could be thought of as either 18 fifths up or 13 fifths down, but I treat it as neutral in the whole major/minor tonality scheme.)</p><p>I also call the septimal subminor ratios &quot;default blues&quot; tuning, but what you&apos;re talking about could also be melisma, moving the pitch around to give the melody some life and passion, since flat, steady pitches aren&apos;t going to sound very exciting. (In Arabic music, it&apos;s one of the parts of _tarab_, the art of achieving musical ecstasy; blues, jazz, rock, soul and country have their own generally-unwritten rules of &quot;tarab&quot;.)</p><p>Of course, singers generally don&apos;t try to sing exact JI ratios and shouldn&apos;t; I&apos;m talking about fixed-pitch instruments here, and I&apos;m only approximating JI with 72-et or whatever I&apos;m using. You&apos;re stuck with the pitch bend wheel if you want melisma. ~D.</p></div><h3><a id=78018 href="#78018">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2008 3:16:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>2008/7/29 Danny Wier &lt;<a href="mailto:dawiertx@sbcglobal.net">dawiertx@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;:</p><p>&gt; So what would you call _utonal_ 7-limit intervals, the &quot;major-in-minor&quot;<br/>&gt; tonalities?
