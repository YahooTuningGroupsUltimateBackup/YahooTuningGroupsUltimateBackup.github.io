I agree with Fred Reinagel that adding notes is not an<br/>inconvenience for playing. I have 12 frets, however, where historical<br/>instruments have 7 even though the alteration is not much of a task nor is it<br/>irreversable.</p><p>There are far more ambiguous choices in designing a keyboard than a fretboard,<br/>and not all of them having to do with navigation (does anyone remember the<br/>multiplexing Timex Sinclair?). There are issues of key-dip, spacing, width at<br/>balance rails, even - or especially - string and action spacing; though these<br/>have been overcome (despite the diificulties) in a number of historical<br/>keyboards, obviously these did not become standardized. It took the Jankko<br/>keyboard to bring about the &quot;generalized keyboard,&quot; by abandoning the straight<br/>7+5 arrangement (which split sharps, up to 17 tones/naturals up to 19, do not).</p><p>The music industry still seems to be faring fairly well with 12 tones (as they<br/>seem to be doing with presets on &quot;synthesizers&quot;). It is a least common<br/>denominator that sounds within reason - both simpler to learn and play (and if<br/>we are discussing historical [ie corporeal] instruments, to tune), and simpler<br/>to manufacture.</p><p>Not that I let this stop me, though.</p><p>Clark Panaccione</p></div>
