I think if one hears what another can do, after getting to know the instrument and finding it&apos;s strengths (and weaknesses) it often times gives one a better impression than going into a store, plugging in some headphones and playing away on the box.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2003 1:43:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46939">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46939</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Even the TX81Z has *much* better sounds:  particularly the FM<br/>bells and such, which are virtually unmatched...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ahem, my Z&apos;s are pretty much boat anchors at this point.

And that is coming from someone who pretty much wrung out the possibilities of the TX bells. I used to use Sound Quest and another old program (on an Amiga!) that would morph entire banks of sounds from two patches, looking for all the possible permutations of bell and mallet instrument sounds (duh).</p><p>&gt; ***And they are about 3 times as expensive, yes??</p><p>Oh, I&apos;m know they&apos;re more expensive. Chinese factory-made violins cost a heck of a lot less than Italian instruments as well.

It&apos;s<br/>a *very* tunable unit, and the bell-like FM sounds are superb.  I&apos;ve<br/>gotten quite a bit of variety out of it, as Aaron Johnson kindly<br/>mentions.
