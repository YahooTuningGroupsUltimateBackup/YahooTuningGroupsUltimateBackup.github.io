One<br/>of the things Partch was trying to do, after having defined Otonal<br/>and Utonal to begin with, was to treat them equally in his music and<br/>right what he considered to be a wrong in this respect. I haven&apos;t<br/>heard enough of his music to know whether Otonal and Utonal are in<br/>fact equally respected in his works.</p><p>Gee... this is an interesting question, but Jon Szanto isn&apos;t on this<br/>list...
