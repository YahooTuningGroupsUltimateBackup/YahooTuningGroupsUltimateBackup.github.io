The principal question is whether<br/>the indicated quartertones are intended to be played as precise<br/>24th-root-of-two intervals or as inflections of 12-tone equal temperament<br/>pitches, without precise intervallic ratios.   Your answer would be much<br/>appreciated.</p><p>DJWolf<br/>********<br/>ear Mr Wolf,</p><p>Thank you for your query. The answer to the question depends on which work<br/>you are discussing. For instance, in &apos;Adagissimo&apos; I specify exactly<br/>tempered pitches for the 2 violins, and inflectional pitches for the viola<br/>and cello. In general, one might say that I regard ALL pitches as<br/>contextually inflectional - in &apos;classical&apos; 12-tone works (Schoenberg et<br/>al.) the performer really has to judge where exact tuning is structurally<br/>necessary and where intervallic qualities need to be &apos;enhanced&apos; by<br/>directional distortion. I regard microtonal harmony somewhat differently<br/>that semitonal, in that, for me, the former is predominantly concerned with<br/>instability, disbalance i.e. microtonal pitch distribution tends, via local<br/>instability, to push vertical alignments towards other states. Voice<br/>leading is thus replaced by a form of dynamic decomposition within the<br/>verticality itself. Although similar effects may be achieved in semitonal<br/>sonorities, the effect is much less pronounced. I always write with a view<br/>to connoting to the performer the degree of meaningful deviation this or<br/>that microtonal formation requires. This is a question of larger<br/>compositional technique considerations, not of abstract generational<br/>theory. Does this answer your question?</p><p>best regards,</p><p>Brian Ferneyhough</p><p>*******</p><p>Dear mr Wolf,</p><p>Further to our exchange on microtones: I should emphasise that, for me, it<br/>is vital to so utilise microtonal elements that NOT their absolute value is<br/>central to the cognitive act, but the listener&apos;s ability to &apos;hear AS&apos; i.e<br/>that the musical context provide the frame within which the hierarchical<br/>locatedness of any given element can be functionally assessed. The tonal<br/>system provides one such powerful system whereby even starkly deviant<br/>intervals can be &apos;heard as&apos; whatever their notional identity happens to be.<br/>This has always been a problem in my mind with special tuning systems which<br/>do not contain this leeway. MY own research in microtonal domains has<br/>always been aimed at establishing analogous referential frames. The<br/>fundamental issue with microtonal composition lies in composition, not the<br/>microtones.</p><p>BF</p><p>*******<br/>Dear Professor Ferneyhough:</p><p>Thank you for your answers. May I forward a copy of your messages to the<br/>Alternative Tuning List? I think that they will be read there with great<br/>interest.</p><p>In your first message, you wrote:</p><p>&quot;I regard microtonal harmony somewhat differently<br/>that semitonal, in that, for me, the former is predominantly concerned with<br/>instability, disbalance i.e. microtonal pitch distribution tends, via local<br/>instability, to push vertical alignments towards other states.&quot;</p><p>This sounds very much like an implicit, empirical &quot;theory&quot; of consonance and<br/>dissonance and voice leading, albeit one where &quot;pushing&quot; instable<br/>verticalties is not equivalent to tonal resolution. Limiting this discussion<br/>to quartertones, it does happen that the 12 intervals added to those in the<br/>12-tone set tend to fall at points of minimum consonance (in any of the<br/>standard models of consonance and dissonance, with those pitches close to the<br/>7th, 11th, 13th partial possibly excepted).  Have you articulated this<br/>&quot;theory&quot; anywhere more explicitly?</p><p>I don&apos;t quite follow your sentence:</p><p>&quot;I should emphasise that, for me, it<br/>is vital to so utilise microtonal elements that NOT their absolute value is<br/>central to the cognitive act, but the listener&apos;s ability to &apos;hear AS&apos; i.e<br/>that the musical context provide the frame within which the hierarchical<br/>locatedness of any given element can be functionally assessed.&quot;</p><p>I understand (and happen to agree with) the emphasis on composition and the<br/>act of cognition, but don&apos;t quite understand where this functional location<br/>might be.  Are some sorts of ideal relationships (rational or not) intended<br/>to be projected by the notation and performance and construed by the<br/>listener, or is the &quot;frame&quot; simply constructed in real time from the actual<br/>performance data?</p><p>I find it striking that your statement</p><p>&quot;The tonal<br/>system provides one such powerful system whereby even starkly deviant<br/>intervals can be &apos;heard as&apos; whatever their notional identity happens to be.<br/>This has always been a problem in my mind with special tuning systems which<br/>do not contain this leeway.&quot;</p><p>describes a distance to both the just intonationalist and the Babbitt-style<br/>twelve-toner, for whom the notated and played pitches are intonationally<br/>umambiguous with regard to location within the given intonational<br/>environment.</p><p>With best regards,</p><p>DJW</p><p>*************<br/>&quot;I should emphasise that, for me, it<br/>is vital to so utilise microtonal elements that NOT their absolute value is<br/>central to the cognitive act, but the listener&apos;s ability to &apos;hear AS&apos; i.e<br/>that the musical context provide the frame within which the hierarchical<br/>locatedness of any given element can be functionally assessed.&quot;</p><p>Put more directly, I believe that absolute cognitive values of musical<br/>statements are not primarily derived from the recognition of unambiguously<br/>quantified variables (pitches), but that pitches must be extrapolated from<br/>context - in other words, hearing something AS a C# rather than a Db<br/>(regardless of its actual objective frequency) is extremely important to<br/>the cognitive assessment of context. The same is true for microtonal<br/>intervals, and it is incumbent on the composer to make clear what a<br/>particular pitch is meant to be identified as, even if the actual realised<br/>pitch deviates to a greater or lesser degree from the absolute. Any viable<br/>microtonal system must provide for this possibility.</p><p>BF</p><p>PS Please feel to pass on these jottings if you feel that they are germane<br/>to your discussions.</p></div>
