One obvious example is the<br/>&gt; recent success of Moby&apos;s album &apos;Play&apos;. Almost all the songs relied heavily<br/>&gt; on samples of field recordings made by  Alan Lomax  of a capella singing by<br/>&gt; blues singers. These recordings unmistakenly contained 7 limit just<br/>&gt; intonation harmonies and melodies. So obviously people respond to music<br/>&gt; with unfamiliar harmonies.</p><p>Justin,</p><p>You make an excellent point here. Because of trends of sampling world music<br/>in pop, and also various albums in jazz and classical that are fusions of<br/>western and eastern musicians, the CD buying public are exposed to, buying<br/>and enjoying recordings using just intonation.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen<br/><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>--------</p><p>&quot;All TRUTH passes through three stages.<br/>First it is ridiculed.<br/>Second it is violently opposed.<br/>Third it is accepted as being self-evident.&quot;<br/>            Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)</p></div><h3>Justin White &#x3C;justin.white@davidjones.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2000 11:38:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Almost all the songs relied heavily<br/>&gt;&gt;on samples of field recordings made by  Alan Lomax  of a capella singing<br/>by<br/>&gt;&gt;blues singers.

I agree that there&apos;s a lot of microtonality there, but &quot;almost all&quot;<br/>&quot;unmistakenly contained&quot; 7-limit just? Care to back that up? &gt;</p><p>Well I can only report what my ears tell me. I dont have any spectrum<br/>analysers. The point is a moot one anyway. My point is that microtonal<br/>music is there in top 40 music.<br/>Anyway have a listen to Moby&apos;s/[Lomax] &apos;Run on&apos; and tell me that there are<br/>no just dominant seventh chords there. Also I didn&apos;t write &quot;almost all<br/>unmistakenly contained 7 limit just...&quot; you correctly quoted it above, read<br/>it again if you like.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Instrumental music of<br/>&gt;&gt;any kind [with one important exception] has not been popular since people<br/>&gt;&gt;stopped dancing to jazz.</p><p>&lt; Around here there&apos;s a very, very popular brand of jazz/funk that young<br/>people are dancing to. Ever heard of Medeski, Martin, and Wood? &gt;</p><p>Doesn&apos;t this just prove my point ! Popular music tends to be danceable<br/>whether it is jazz, classical or whatever influenced.</p><p>&gt;If music does not  make human limbs and torsos<br/>&gt;want move in a rhythmic way it only succeeds in conveying a general<br/>emotion</p><p>&lt; A general emotion? I don&apos;t know what that means, but I&apos;ve seen huge<br/>audiences transfixed during long non-danceable, lyricless segments of many<br/>bands such as Phish. Being in a danceable band myself, I know that our<br/>non-danceable numbers are enjoyed with as much appreciation as the<br/>danceable<br/>ones -- people appreciate the chance to rest their bodies and use their<br/>heads instead. &gt;</p><p>What I mean by a general emotion is the same as emotion.Purely instrumental<br/>music seemes to convey emotion well and Emotion doesn&apos;t convey specific<br/>ideas [it won&apos;t tell you what time it is or the reason for global warming.<br/>It can however frame words conveying these ideas and give a sort of value<br/>judgement on these ideas].</p><p>Your point about Phish is a good one but in reality there has only been a<br/>few superduper popular purely instrumental albums [Pink Floyd&apos;s &apos;Dark side<br/>of the Moon&apos; and Oldfield&apos;s &apos;Tubular Bells&apos; come readily to mind] generally<br/>music hugging the top 40 of charts is either dance based or it is song<br/>based. What I think you are talking about is groups that manage to do<br/>instrumental music professionally, and there are many of them [new age<br/>music, ambient electronic etc], what I would like to see though is someone<br/>on this list get a top ten hit I mean someone who is using non 12-et<br/>tunings deliberately.</p><p>This could be done by educating people in this music to a stage where we<br/>don&apos;t have to change the music we make at all [this is basically what we<br/>are doing here]. It will take some time but we could reach a stage where we<br/>could all be professional in the not too distant future.</p><p>A much easier option is changing ourselves which can happen any time.</p><p>What I think would be good is if we sold out slightly to popular taste,<br/>only to pull the suckers in and get them hooked on this alternate tuning<br/>thing !</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p><p>This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended solely for<br/>the recipient.
