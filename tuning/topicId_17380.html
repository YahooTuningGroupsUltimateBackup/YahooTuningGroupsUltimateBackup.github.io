They&apos;re jazzy standards, and to my ear, great stuff! See if<br/>&gt;&gt;you don&apos;t agree it&apos;s surprising that separate notes in separate voices<br/>&gt;&gt;could all be crammed into 15 available midi channels (plus the drum<br/>&gt;&gt;channel).</p><p>David Finnamore responded, <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16114">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16114</a> :<br/>&gt;I think the horns, winds, and bass sound great retuned. If I were<br/>&gt;you, I&apos;d leave the piano and vibes in 12 EDO. To me, they too often<br/>&gt;sound &quot;funny&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; not being fixed pitch, especially the<br/>&gt;piano. It makes me feel ungrounded to have the piano pitches<br/>&gt;floating around. I&apos;m sure that&apos;s due to expectations of what a piano<br/>&gt;should be after years of playing and listening to them. But I also<br/>&gt;think that the contrast of tunings between fixed and flexible<br/>&gt;intonation instruments is part of the style.</p><p>Though my own ears are largely, though not completely, accepting of<br/>retuning in piano and other keyed voices, I&apos;ve just added an option that<br/>allows complete or partial suppression of retuning of keyed voices.<br/>I&apos;ve uploaded a couple of examples for list members with General MIDI<br/>(GM) capability: go to <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/</a>, change into<br/>the JMids directory, and download <a href="http://KeyedSeqs.zip">KeyedSeqs.zip</a>.  It contains two<br/>multi-voice sequences:</p><p>   A String of Pearls<br/>   I Left My Heart in San Francisco</p><p>Included are the original 12-tET, a 7-limit retuning without<br/>restrictions on keyed instruments, and a 7-limit retuning WITH the new<br/>restriction.  For keyed instruments, I&apos;m using GM voices 0 internal<br/>(Acoustic Grand Piano) thru 21 internal (Reed Organ) - these map to 1<br/>thru 22 when the instrument numbers are displayed in the range 1 .. 128.</p><p>Of the two sequences, sanFran is largely piano, so its tuning is largely<br/>quelled in the restricted version.  Pearls just has occasional piano,<br/>so there is less overall change from the unrestricted version.</p><p>So far, no one has stated that they prefer 5-limit to 7-limit treatments<br/>of these works.  I could do up 5-limit versions if anyone really wants<br/>to hear them.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
