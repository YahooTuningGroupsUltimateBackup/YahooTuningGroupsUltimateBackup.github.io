This is where I&apos;m at now:</p><p><a href="http://www.ronsword.com/sounds/Ron%20Sword%20-%2016-tone%20acoustic%20improvisation.mp3">http://www.ronsword.com/sounds/Ron%20Sword%20-%2016-tone%20acoustic%20improvisation.mp3</a></p><p>When I hear stuff like this, I feel like that if major 7 chords in<br/>16-equal can sound good, the whole paradigm of what sounds &quot;good&quot;<br/>needs a shift. Furthermore, the whole thing fits together into some<br/>kind of beautifully relaxing 16-tone chromatic superstructure that is<br/>quite foreign and xenharmonic (xentonal, perhaps), that is<br/>comprehensible and makes sense. It&apos;s a success, it&apos;s great, it&apos;s the<br/>first thing I&apos;ve ever heard that just &quot;clicks&quot; like that, it&apos;s what I<br/>wanted when I joined the list.</p><p>&quot;And I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll agree too.&quot;</p><p>.....<br/>.....</p><p>Well, actually, probably not. Some of you will listen to the above<br/>example and just not hear the same thing at all. You&apos;ll say &quot;no part<br/>of my paradigm needs a shift. Major 7 chords don&apos;t sound good in this.<br/>In fact, the whole thing sounds like shit, and I still hate mavila.&quot; I<br/>expect some of us will effectively disagree on whether or not above<br/>example sounds &quot;Good.&quot; But rather than go down that road again, I<br/>wanted to try a different approach and ask &quot;why are we disagreeing at<br/>all?&quot; Well, I can only report my own experience on that.</p><p>When I first started listening to mavila, I thought that the fifths<br/>sounded -awful-. And I also thought that the 375 cent major thirds<br/>were flatter than hell. But something about Ron&apos;s example intrigued<br/>me, particularly the way that the fifths didn&apos;t sound like a Stanley<br/>Kubrick movie score as they did in Scala, so I kept plowing into it. I<br/>bought an iPhone, got the SSquares app, set the shorter axis to 3\16<br/>and the longer axis to 2\16, and played it every time I thought about<br/>it. I used a square wave, so there was no beating. After like two<br/>weeks of that, I didn&apos;t even notice the fifths anymore.</p><p>As for categorical perception, the flat fifths stopped sounding like<br/>they were uncomfortably encroaching slightly onto &quot;tritone&quot; territory.<br/>The 3/2&apos;s started sounding more or less indistinguishable in character<br/>and &quot;quality&quot; from those in 12-equal, except a little narrower if you<br/>think about it and definitely a bit more &quot;relaxed&quot; and less overtly<br/>colorful-sounding. But they don&apos;t sound jarring or dirty or &quot;wrong&quot; or<br/>anything like that. What is really noticeable is that a bunch of<br/>stacked 3/2&apos;s starts to lead you somewhere completely different than<br/>you&apos;d expect, but not in a bad way.</p><p>And as for Harmonic Entropy, VF perception and HE doesn&apos;t seem to<br/>matter at all now that I&apos;ve got the hang of it. What matters seems to<br/>be &quot;functions.&quot; Given the proper musical context, even the 150 cent<br/>&quot;9/8&apos;s&quot; seem to assume their proper and familiar &quot;function,&quot; in that<br/>they &quot;sound like 9/8.&quot; 1050 cents sounds like it could equally be a<br/>major 7th, as in the chord 0-375-675-1050, or it could be the root of<br/>IV/IV, as in Bbmaj -&gt; Fmaj -&gt; Cmaj. And the fact that I know that the<br/>5/4&apos;s are accessible via three 4/3&apos;s up has -REALLY- changed the color<br/>of the major thirds in a really pleasant way. They taste like citrus<br/>now!</p><p>Anyway, the point is, it took me about a month or two of actually<br/>playing mavila on an AXiS and on my iPhone for me to completely throw<br/>away almost everything I had learned about how music works. Learning<br/>seems to be far more important than I had anticipated, and I have to<br/>say that I&apos;m enjoying the benefits of the omnitetrachordal,<br/>Miller-limit compliant, diatonic-sized, 3/2-generated Mavila MOS&apos;s as<br/>a result. Despite that even the most basic components of JI logic<br/>completely fail in 16 (10/9 is larger than 9/8, for example, and 10/9<br/>and 8/7 are equated, and three 10/9&apos;s makes a 3/2), and that the whole<br/>thing just doesn&apos;t make any sense at all at first, at the end of the<br/>day it&apos;s just a new set of rules to learn and a new set of categorical<br/>perceptions to develop. And once you get the gist of it, it&apos;s by far<br/>the most rewarding system that I&apos;ve found yet (with porcupine coming<br/>up close behind). So hey, try it, you might enjoy it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101029 href="#101029">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2011 6:24:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me...the whole Mavilla musical example sounds &quot;stable but stresses/squeezed&quot;...and I can definitely notice the flat fifths, but still feel a very intelligent stability to the entire construct.&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Given the proper musical context, even the 150 cent &quot;9/8&apos;s&quot; seem to assume their proper and familiar &quot;function,&quot; in that they &quot;sound like 9/8.&quot; &quot;</p><p>&nbsp; I agree on this completely.&nbsp; And there are some cases where using HE to define what &quot;sounds alike&quot; simply doesn&apos;t work or even cases where one interval (IE 9/7) will sound much more like a fourth in one scale and much more like a third in another due to context.<br/>&nbsp; This again hints back to my argument &quot;there are three types of chords: those that only function as resolved chords, more flexible ones<br/> that can function as resolved or tense, and those that can only function as tense/&quot;dissonant&quot; chords&quot;.&nbsp; And my hunch is...Mavilla MOS&apos;s tend to have a lot of the &quot;flexible&quot; type of chords..even is some of those are still a bit too dissonant for a non-accustomed listener to think of as true resolve points.</p></div>
