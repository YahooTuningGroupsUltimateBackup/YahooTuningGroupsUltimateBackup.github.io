Since the ancient<br/>Indian sage-musicians did not use any ratios and cents when they<br/>wrote on the topic of shruti, we find their writings ambiguous and<br/>difficult to interpret.</p><p>The following is one more attempt to seek some light, perhaps even<br/>throw some light, on our undertanding of the working of shruti-s.</p><p>Assumptions.  We have reasonably assumed that<br/>              (1) 9  shruti-s = the fourth = 4/3<br/>              (2) 13 shruti-s = the fifth = 3/2<br/>              (3) The shruti scale is octave, 2:1<br/>              (4) The skhima, 32805/32768 (1.95 cents),<br/>is                                                 traditionally<br/>considered &quot;insignificant&quot;.</p><p>Methodology of investigation.  Aesthetics and theory go hand in<br/>hand, though seldom simultaneously and concurrently.  Should a<br/>conflict between them arise, aesthetics would prevail over theory.<br/>In such cases, theory, eventually, finds out a reasonable<br/>interpretation of the conflict, and resolves it.</p><p>Extended Reference.  Whether, and to what extent, the hypothesis of<br/>extended reference is applicable to improvisations of a raga, needs<br/>to be investigated seriously, especially if we feel that, by doing<br/>so, the aesthetic value of shruti applications may be enhanced.<br/>Should the results of the preliminary exploration demand, we should<br/>even consider &quot;inducing&quot; extended reference to the raga-s.</p><p>Shruti System.  Shruti system is not a a system whose time evolution<br/>can be predicted exactly.  So, it has a non-deterministic tone<br/>structure.</p><p>For the sake of observation and investigation, a shruti system may be<br/>construed as discrete, fixed points along a pitch axis.  However, we<br/>agree that shruti system is not a static set of pitches.  So, on the<br/>one hand, which shruti(s) should be used to achieve a certain<br/>aesthetic atmosphere in a raga is fairly predictable by practice, on<br/>the other, it is the range of shruti-s, rather than one specific<br/>shruti, that matters.</p><p>To put it differently, the stage and the laboratory go hand in hand.<br/>The shruti applications during a performance, however ecstatic and<br/>esoteric, can be measured in a sound laboratory.  This helps in<br/>relating, to whatever extent, the use of shruti-s during a<br/>performance, to the aesthetics of the resultant delight.  At least<br/>some generalisations can be proposed for further investigations.</p><p>Shruti -- The Dynamic Micro-intonation.  The shruti is dynamic<br/>intonation, not a mere entity measured in frequency (though<br/>measurABLE in terms of frequency ratios).  Though any number of<br/>shruti-s may fall outside the nominal scale steps, yet the number of<br/>musically useful shruti-s does not exceed 22 in any given scale<br/>octave.</p><p>Designing the methodology.  In a nutshell, the recording of a stage<br/>performance by a well-known singer shold be examined in the<br/>laboratory for shruti applications.  This, then, can be repeated with<br/>different well-known singers, to hopefully arrive at some<br/>generalisations.</p><p>Comments, please.<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
