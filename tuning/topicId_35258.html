Often the musical assumptions are so different that any<br/>&quot;comparison&quot; seems to me a bit strange, although I would grant that<br/>everything is connected to everything, and that unlikely connections<br/>can sometimes be the most interesting.</p><p>Robert, your presentation on different bases and &quot;centlike&quot;<br/>measurements suggests to me a term for a very useful unit you<br/>demonstrated: maybe the &quot;centistep&quot; equal to 1/100n-octave in any<br/>n-tET: thus 1700 centisteps to an octave in 17-EDO, or 3100 in 31-EDO,<br/>etc.</p><p>The iota is simply a special case of this, and the advantages you note<br/>and illustrate can apply not only to a 17-note system (equal or<br/>unequal) where each step is some kind of &quot;semitone&quot; (or &quot;thirdtone&quot;),<br/>but to a 31-note system with &quot;fifthtone&quot; steps, and so on. These units<br/>might be of special interest where steps are slightly unequal, since<br/>they show how intervals vary from the mean or &quot;average&quot; size.</p><p>Thus cents would be 12-centisteps, a special case of your more general<br/>concept, just as iotas are 17-centisteps, and your 31-centisteps<br/>follow the same pattern.</p><p>Incidentally, your heptadecimal or base-17 notation (if the first term<br/>is correct, by analogy with &quot;hexadecimal&quot;) shows a curious property of<br/>17: as you explain, it goes</p><p>        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f  g</p><p>Here we have the same letters as the seven note names of traditional<br/>European notation as described by people like Guido d&apos;Arezzo<br/>(c. 1030). This isn&apos;t the only note-naming system, of course, in the<br/>early European tradition, since some systems continue h i k, etc., in<br/>higher octaves (the distinct letter &quot;j&quot; not yet being standard in<br/>medieval Latin, so that &quot;h i k ...&quot; would continue the series).</p><p>Anyway, centisteps are an interesting way of representing a range of<br/>EDO steps, and in showing how far a given ratio or interval varies<br/>from the average in a not-too-far-from-equal system of a given size.<br/>They should be a very nice feature in FTS.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=35283 href="#35283">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2002 2:14:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

I think at least from what you&apos;ve said before that<br/>Pythagorean tunings are of interest, so let&apos;s compare iotas and shismas in a 17-context in connection to pure fifths.</p><p>To the nearest iota, a fifth is 994 iotas. If we use this in connection with a Pythagorean scale, we get</p><p>0--288--576--706--994--1282--1570--1700</p><p>The correct values to two decimal places are</p><p>0--288.87--577.75--705.56--994.44--1283.31--1572.18--1700</p><p>On the other hand, doing the same thing with 612 gives us</p><p>0--104--208--254--358--462--566-612</p><p>with correct values to two decimal places of</p><p>0--103.99--207.99--254.00--358.00--461.99--565.99--612</p><p>Despite its smaller step size, the 612 is vastly more accurate. If we compare how well they represent 17-et intervals, the answer of course is equally well, so there seems no advantage to using iotas. Further, if we want to relate iotas to 12-et, we find that it has a step size of 141.67 iotas, which is hardly as convenient as saying 51 sk. I guess I am baffled by what possible advantage you (and Robert, it seems) see in iotas.</p><p>&gt; The iota, or 17-centistep as I&apos;ll explain below, is likely to be used<br/>&gt; in a rather different musical setting, where semitones are not too far<br/>&gt; from 1/17 octave, or major thirds from 6/17 octave, and so forth.</p><p>Which shismas can do better than iotas! The iota major third is a not particularly convenient 527.28; shismas are more accurate, as well as simpler, in calling this 197.02, which is easier to take to be 197 than 527 is to be a major third when using iotas. Again, when asking how well each one deals with 1/17 of an octave or 6/17 of an octave, the answer is equally well. Iotas have it as 100 and 600, whereas shismas have it as 36 and 216; both are exact.</p><p>&gt; Thus I would see each standard as potentially &quot;the best&quot; where<br/>&gt; applicable. Often the musical assumptions are so different that any<br/>&gt; &quot;comparison&quot; seems to me a bit strange, although I would grant that<br/>&gt; everything is connected to everything, and that unlikely connections<br/>&gt; can sometimes be the most interesting.</p><p>So far as I can see the two systems are doing the same thing in the same way and are directly comparable. I don&apos;t see what advantage there is to iotas, and so far, you haven&apos;t suggested one. When measuring *relative* error, the idea of relative cents, which would be iotas in the particular case of 17-et, makes sense to me, but that does not seem to be what you are doing.</p></div><h3><a id=35321 href="#35321">ðŸ”—</a>M.

For example, major thirds will average at<br/>600 iotas (~423.53 cents), minor thirds at 400 iotas (~282.35 cents),<br/>and neutral thirds at 500 iotas (~352.94 cents).</p><p>In a typical 17-note system of this type for which iotas were<br/>designed, a lot of usual just ratios (or close tempered<br/>approximations) will tend to be not too far from these average<br/>sizes. Some examples may help to illustrate this point, with interval<br/>sizes given in iotas, cents, and also your 612-EDO units of<br/>approximately 1.96 cents (with 1 cent equal to precisely 0.51 of these<br/>units):</p><p>Major thirds (Average size 600 iotas or 423.53 cents)<br/>------------<br/>   14:11        591.47 iotas      417.51 cents     212.93 612-EDO<br/>   23:18        601.18 iotas      424.36 cents     216.43 612-EDO<br/>    9:7         616.37 iotas      435.08 cents     221.89 612-EDO</p><p>Minor thirds (Average size 400 iotas or 282.35 cents)<br/>------------<br/>    7:6         378.07 iotas      266.87 cents     136.10 612-EDO<br/>   20:17        398.59 iotas      281.36 cents     143.49 612-EDO<br/>   13:11        409.71 iotas      289.21 cents     147.50 612-EDO</p><p>Neutral or semi-neutral thirds (Average size 500 iotas or 352.94 cents)<br/>------------------------------<br/>    17:14       476.18 iotas      336.13 cents     171.42 612-EDO<br/>    11:9        492.16 iotas      347.41 cents     177.18 612-EDO<br/>    27:22       502.28 iotas      354.55 cents     180.82 612-EDO<br/>    16:13       509.25 iotas      359.47 cents     183.33 612-EDO<br/>    21:17       518.25 iotas      365.83 cents     186.57 612-EDO</p><p>A point I might add is that units such as iotas -- or cents, as far as<br/>I can tell -- are intended to measure intervals in terms of some equal<br/>division of the octave, rather than to approximate just ratios as<br/>evenly as possible. Of course, with lots of units per octave, the<br/>maximum deviation of half a unit won&apos;t be too large.</p><p>The advantage of iotas is that they show in what I find an intuitive<br/>way how close a given interval is to the average size: for example, a<br/>major third at 23:18 is very close to the average, while 14:11 is a<br/>bit smaller than average and 9:7 considerably larger.</p><p>That&apos;s the purpose of iotas: to show how just ratios or other interval<br/>sizes compare with the average sizes for a 17-note thirdtone system,<br/>these averages representing the sizes in 17-EDO.</p><p>Of course, we could also keep track of these things with a more<br/>familiar unit such as cents, and the intonational artistry of a master<br/>such as George Secor with his 17-tone well-temperament (17-WT) is<br/>impressive in any unit of measure.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=35335 href="#35335">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2002 11:38:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

If you start to compare 17-notes with some other number of notes, then the rc point of view you might bear in mind. In any case, it might be useful to keep in mind that iotas are relative cents in 17-et, just as cents are in 12-et, so that in 29-et iotas+cents gives the measure in relative cents of 29-et, whereas iotas-cents gives the rc measure of 7-et--and so forth. Likewise, the error of 29 et in 29-et cents is iota error of 17-et + cents error of 12-et.</p></div>
