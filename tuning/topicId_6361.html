Thanks. I love these things!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I can however describe it as a third (and previously unsuspected) member<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt;a class of 12-tone 7-limit tunings for which I don&apos;t have a name. The<br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt;two members are a 12 of 31-tET (or nearby meantone) that I found (I<br/>&gt; really<br/>&gt; &gt;just converted an existing Just scale to 31-tET/meantone) and a tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;where the 225/224 disappears due to Carl Lumma (and we later learned that<br/>&gt; &gt;Fokker had described it earlier in Just terms, rather than tempered).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So in mine we distribute the 81/80 and in Lumma&apos;s we distribute the<br/>&gt; &gt;225/224. Yours is right in between with its distributed 126/125.<br/>&gt; Beautiful!<br/>&gt; &gt;So it is also intermediate in its tradeoff between the number of<br/>&gt; available<br/>&gt; &gt;7-limit harmonies and their accuracy.<br/>&gt; &gt;[...]<br/>&gt; &gt;What this class of tunings (mine, Lumma&apos;s and yours) have in common,<br/>&gt; apart<br/>&gt; &gt;from all being proper 12-tone 7-limit scales, is that if notes are mapped<br/>&gt; &gt;to the nearest 31-tET notes, they all come out as the same mode, which,<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt;a chain of fifths, looks like:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Db Ab .  .  F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# .  .  D# A#<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;So they all have the 3 wolves A#:F, F#:Db and Ab:D#. Lumma&apos;s has an<br/>&gt; &gt;additional wolf D:A as the price of all the remaining 7-limit intervals<br/>&gt; &gt;getting to within 2 cents of Just (which really *is* Just in my book).<br/>&gt; &gt;Yours has two additional (but mild-mannered) wolves, or no wolves but 4<br/>&gt; bad<br/>&gt; &gt;fifths, and can get the remaining 7-limit intervals within 4.6 cents (the<br/>&gt; &gt;tempering you describe has a 5:7 which is 6.5 cents narrow).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Dave, for looking at this! Someone should make a web page<br/>&gt; describing all these varieties, starting with Fokker&apos;s. These are the<br/>&gt; answers to the question &quot;How can we tune a 12-tone scale so as to get a<br/>&gt; significant number of 7-limit harmonies with considerably better tuning<br/>&gt; than 22-tone equal temperament?&quot;.</p></div>
