The &quot;problematic&quot; _Crazy Music_ list (we<br/>know why) and Jon Szanto&apos;s even newer _MakeMicroMusic_ now each have<br/>exactly 38 members.  I would think they are mostly the same people,<br/>with perhaps two or three variants.</p><p>Still, that&apos;s practically 40 active participants.  That would fill a<br/>nice sized room.  Not a bad sign at all.  And, _Tuning Math_ has 34,<br/>so, again, probably *most* of that same audience, with maybe a few<br/>less of the group who are less interested in the &quot;math-intensive&quot;<br/>aspects.</p><p>The other &quot;ancillary lists&quot; have fewer, of course, but most of those<br/>lists were temporary or extremely specialialized:</p><p>Not like the &quot;big 4.&quot;</p><p>So, at around 40 &quot;dedicated&quot; individuals, I think the alternate<br/>Internet tuning community on these lists is a healthy one, indeed!</p><p>________ _______ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
