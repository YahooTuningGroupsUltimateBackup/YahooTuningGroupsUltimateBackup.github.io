It went from 3/2 to 3/2, with 1/1 in<br/>the middle (now it&apos;s part of a larger instrument).  The ratios are:</p><p>3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 16/9, 1/1, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 3/2</p><p>That should form 3 pentatonic scales:</p><p>Olympos:  3/2, 8/5, 1/1, 9/8, 6/5, 3/2</p><p>Partch:  3/2, 5/3, 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 3/2</p><p>Lun:  3/2, 16/9, 1/1, 9/8, 4/3, 3/2</p><p>If you have any more complicated questions, you could try to contact<br/>the company, Woodstock Percussion, in West Hurley, New York.  (I don&apos;t<br/>have their detailed contact information with me right now, but that<br/>should get to them.)</p><p>Although they have become a big company, the people who started it<br/>are still there and they are very nice people.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Lydia Ayers</p><p>Begin forwarded message:</p><p>From: &quot;beckah &quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:beckah@childsgarden.com">beckah@childsgarden.com</a>&gt;</p><p>Does anyone know what the ratios should be on a set of woodstock</p><p>chimes. I just acquired this ten chime set used and the little</p><p>stickers telling what they should be are rubbed off on some. This is</p><p>one of the original sets made.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>bekah</p></div>
