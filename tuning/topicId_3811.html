Choosing each integer as the number of<br/>&gt;steps in the small interval, and calculating the large interval, gives the<br/>&gt;best approximations.  This misses a lot of scales however, so taking the<br/>&gt;large interval and calculating the small is how these lists were produced:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;3/2: 2  5  7 10 12 14 17 19 22 24 27 29 31 34 36 39 41 43 46 48 51 43<br/>&gt;5/4: 3  6  9 12 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 47 50 53<br/>&gt;6/5: 4  8 11 15 19 23 27 30 34 38 42 46 49 53<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By this method, the lowest EDIs with good representations of all 5-limit<br/>&gt;intervals are 19, 34 and 53.  65 is the next.</p><p>This seems a bit restrictive.

Is that what it&apos;s doing?</p><p>[Dave Keenan]<br/>&gt;&gt; I find it interesting that the diatonic scale falls out of<br/>&gt;&gt; this formula for<br/>&gt;&gt; ET&apos;s (EDO&apos;s) with reasonable fifths, N = 5T + 2s where T &gt;= 0<br/>&gt;&gt; and T/9 &lt;= s &lt;= 6T/7.</p><p>[Graham Breed]<br/>&gt;Er, hang on, where do these numbers come from?</p><p>&quot;T&quot; for &quot;tone&quot;, &quot;s&quot; for &quot;semitone&quot;. By restricting &quot;s&quot; in this way I limit<br/>the error in the fifths to something like +-13c (specifically the best and<br/>second best fifths in 47-tET) and eliminate the ETs that are multiples of 5<br/>or 7 as being not good enough. But this was irrelevant to my point, which<br/>was just what I think you said elsewhere, that the diatonic 5T+2s is simply<br/>the smallest fifth-based MOS. In future I&apos;ll use W and h, after Dan<br/>Stearns, instead of T and s.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think these [major-third based] scales would work<br/>&gt;melodically as d is so much smaller than T for good major thirds.</p><p>Agreed. The minor-thirds aren&apos;t so bad at only 4 to 1. But still pretty<br/>bad. As Paul Erlich said, you can just keep going up the sequence (down the<br/>tree as you drew them) adding the appropriate number of the smaller<br/>interval each time, until you get a proper scale. But that&apos;s often too many<br/>notes. And we have seen that the number of consonances can get quite large<br/>enough long before propriety is achieved. We&apos;d need 15 notes for propriety<br/>in the minor-thirds MOS and 16 for major-thirds. But we get sufficient<br/>harmonic resources with 11 and 10 notes respectively. It sure is hard to<br/>beat 6 triads from a proper 7 notes (diatonic).</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;g.breed@xxx.xx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/1999 4:57:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;3/2: 2  5  7 10 12 14 17 19 22 24 27 29 31 34 36 39 41 43 46 48 51 43<br/>&gt; &gt;5/4: 3  6  9 12 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 47 50 53<br/>&gt; &gt;6/5: 4  8 11 15 19 23 27 30 34 38 42 46 49 53<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;By this method, the lowest EDIs with good representations of<br/>&gt; all 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt;intervals are 19, 34 and 53.  65 is the next.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems a bit restrictive.

Taking each<br/>interval alone, it has something to do with economy.  Taking all intervals<br/>together it&apos;s fairly meaningless.  There are better methods for showing<br/>which ETs have good approximations to a range of intervals.  And they show<br/>12 as extremely economical.  The advantage of this method is that it can<br/>help you find a two-step generalisation, and also that all approximations<br/>must be consistent.</p><p>However, I may as well point out that that this method gives no all-round<br/>7-limit ET, but 31= is good for all of what I think Partch called &quot;intervals<br/>of 7&quot; that is 7/4, 7/5, 7/6 and equivalents.</p><p>&gt; the diatonic 5T+2s is simply the smallest fifth-based MOS.</p><p>No, 2V+T is the smallest (V=fourth), then the classic pentatonic scale<br/>2U+3T.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t think these [major-third based] scales would work<br/>&gt; &gt;melodically as d is so much smaller than T for good major thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.

I haven&apos;t tried the 5/4 scales -- I<br/>suppose I should -- but they would logically either sound like a 3-note<br/>scale with inflections, which is boring, or a complete mess of small<br/>intervals with big jumps.</p><p>The 6/5 scales look a bit more promising, and I may well try them out.  The<br/>4+7 scale has the largest atomic intervals as 3 steps from 19, which should<br/>be small enough, and it can fit into one octave of a normal keyboard.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
