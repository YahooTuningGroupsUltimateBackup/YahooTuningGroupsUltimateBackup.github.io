<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Would a 22TET page be wanted?</h1><h3>basila@xxx.xxx</h3><span>8/19/1999 11:48:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Howdy!</p><p>  As y&apos;all know, I&apos;m working on learning about<br/>microtonal music in general, from more of a<br/>practical standpoint as opposed to a hard<br/>theoretical standpoint (although I am learning<br/>quite a bit of theory). I&apos;m also learning<br/>how to work on guitars and using microtonal<br/>music as an inspiration to help me do so.</p><p>  I think I&apos;ve decided to use 22TET as my first<br/>experimental electric guitar neck. I&apos;ve been<br/>researching a few tunings, and playing with<br/>CSound, and have come to that conclusion<br/>(it&apos;s not set in stone yet, but I&apos;m 90% sure).<br/>I&apos;ve collected a lot of articles and links to<br/>pages on the net about 22TET, and I think I&apos;ll<br/>make a page about it, if anyone else is<br/>interested. I&apos;d love to have some of you who<br/>have written to me (i.e. Peter Blasser, Kris<br/>Peck, etc.) concerning 22TET to write articles<br/>or notes or send pics of 22TET instruments to<br/>me for the page.</p><p>  Is this a stupid idea? Is it a great idea?<br/>In the middle? Lemme know.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Darin &quot;Basil&quot; Arrick<br/><a href="mailto:basil@homestead.org">basil@homestead.org</a></p><p>Nonagon<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Diner/2190">http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Diner/2190</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

I hope you include a link to my articles,<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/Erlich.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/Erlich.html</a>. I would be happy to also<br/>send you a picture of my 22-tone, 7-string guitar and scores of some short<br/>pieces I have written (would anyone volunteer to convert these to MIDI<br/>and/or CSound? I tried loading Peter Blasser&apos;s &quot;Rocky&quot; but it didn&apos;t work .<br/>. .)</p><p>You guys should try to get in touch with Morris Moshe Cotel, he&apos;s a prof in<br/>Brooklyn, I believe, and wrote a major two-piano work in 22-tET that got<br/>rave reviews (around 1980, I think).</p></div>
