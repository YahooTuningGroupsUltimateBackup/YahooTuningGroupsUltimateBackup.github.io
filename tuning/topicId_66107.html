I was working on an Excel worksheet<br/>regarding my 79-tone scheme that might facilitate beat-rate calculations if<br/>developed further. I couldn&apos;t manage to complete the ratios section though,<br/>as the program refuses to calculate the cents for the numbers linked to the<br/>fractions in the adjacent cell. (That is to say, e. g. 81/80 resides in cell<br/>number G110, and yet, I cannot obtain the cent values for 81/80 when I use<br/>the cell number instead of typing the ratio directly.) Perhaps someone here<br/>knows a workaround solution?</p><p>Anyway, I wonder if it is possible to make all the tempered 5ths<br/>equal-beating. But I surmise that would require drastic alterations.<br/>Instead, maybe we can focus on integer beat-rates. For starters, we could<br/>consider 1/1 to be 260 Hz. It could be allowed to alter this reference tone<br/>5 cents up or down.</p><p>Do you think we can make progress?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Petr Pa&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;zek&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:p.parizek@chello.cz">p.parizek@chello.cz</a>&gt;<br/>To: &quot;Tuning List&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 21 Nisan 2006 Cuma 17:21<br/>Subject: [tuning] Briefly for Ozan</p><p>&gt; Hi Ozan.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Recently you&apos;ve asked me to think about beat ratios in your 79-tone<br/>tuning.<br/>&gt; For a starting point, let me ask two questions:<br/>&gt; 1. What absolute frequencies would you like to choose as a starting<br/>octave?<br/>&gt; If I want to examine beat rates in your tuning and make an useful whole of<br/>&gt; it, I have to start with two absolute frequencies and the 2/1 ratio is the<br/>&gt; best choice, I think.<br/>&gt; 2. How much do you allow me to alter the starting frequency in case I<br/>needed<br/>&gt; to find meaningful beat rates? For example, if I make a 12-tone keyboard<br/>&gt; tuning which should start with an A4 of 440Hz at best, I know this<br/>starting<br/>&gt; A4 should not be away by more than, let&apos;s say, 10 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;</p><p>------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt; Hi Ozan.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you tell me what you would prefer to choose as a starting octave?

The only thing which complicates the matter a bit<br/>is<br/>&gt; the large number of tones. FYI, the 12-tone system took me almost two days<br/>&gt; to develop into the final form. :-D<br/>&gt; I was very lucky, as I&apos;ve said, as there is another very similar meantone<br/>&gt; which DOES have these properties by itself (you can find more about these<br/>&gt; synchronous types of meantone in message 62320). Another problem is that I<br/>&gt; do these things just by hand and head as I haven&apos;t found an universal<br/>method<br/>&gt; for finding similar beat rates in scales. If I managed to find one, then I<br/>&gt; could try to make a small utility which could do these tasks for me much<br/>&gt; faster. Even more, neither do I have a 79-tone keyboard nor a 79-tone &quot;way<br/>&gt; of keyboard thinking&quot;, which makes it impossible for me to prove if my<br/>&gt; assumptions here or there are right. But if I managed to find something<br/>like<br/>&gt; a common kind of procedure for all of these tunings, maybe things could<br/>&gt; change. Maybe when I finish my second year at school in June, then I can<br/>&gt; think about the question of such a procedure which could be easily<br/>&gt; transcribed into a small piece of code. Sadly, as I&apos;m not a great<br/>&gt; programmer, I always write my software for the old-fashioned QBasic which<br/>&gt; runs under MSDos. So if I wanted to give such a program to you, for<br/>example,<br/>&gt; someone would have to rewrite it into a more usual form beforehand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2006 10:55:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan.</p><p>I&apos;m very sorry for not informing you sooner, or more precisely, not having<br/>an idea of having to inform you sooner, that I have some sort of &quot;reduced&quot;<br/>version of WinXP.

Mayhap you can view the Excel file from<br/>another computer? I think it will be well worth the effort.</p><p>All in all, I have discovered that tempering the second fifth in the cycle<br/>by 19/53 of a syntonic comma (if not 79 MOS 159-tET) is practically<br/>identical to 33 equal divisions of 4/3 carried over to the 79th degree which<br/>then is completed to the octave whereby the &grave;remainder comma&grave; is moved<br/>between steps 45-46....</p><p>I myself consider that the 59th degree (tempered 27/16) best corresponds to<br/>A4=440 hz.
