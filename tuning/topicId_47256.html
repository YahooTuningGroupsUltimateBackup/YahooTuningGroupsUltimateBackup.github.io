Consider the history of musical innovations in<br/>the early 20th century. Around 1910 a crisis occurred which<br/>profoundly affected subsequent events. Tonality, which had been a<br/>primary basis for musical organization for some two hundred years,<br/>was seen by many of the more progressive composers of the time as<br/>having been exhausted. In response, these composer set out to explore<br/>other means of musical organizationÂ—involving other aspects of music,<br/>some of which (like rhythm) had remained nearly static since the very<br/>beginnings of the &quot;common practice&quot; period. Harmony, as such, was<br/>either ignored or maintained at the same level of development it had<br/>reached in 1910. In the absence of some fairly powerful new<br/>organizing principles, post-tonal music might well have become<br/>utterly incoherent. The fact that it did not is evidence that these<br/>composers did indeed discover such organizing principles, and thatÂ—in<br/>a more general senseÂ—it is quite possible to make music without<br/>harmony.</p><p>&apos;Now, however, (1984), we find ourselves at a point where these<br/>various other aspects of music have all been quite thoroughly<br/>explored. Although it would be naive to imagine that nothing new is<br/>likely to emerge in these areas, it can certainly be said that none<br/>of them has remained &quot;static&quot; in our century. Rhythm, timbre,<br/>texture, form, and even the aesthetic premises and social functions<br/>of music have all been reexamined and elaborated to an extent without<br/>precedent in any earlier period of Western (or perhaps any other)<br/>music. What has not changed since that watershed year of 1910Â—at<br/>least in any progressive-evolutionary senseÂ—is harmony, and it seems<br/>time now to confront this issue again, since it can hardly be ignored<br/>indefinitely. It is far too basic (even primitive) an aspect of<br/>auditory perception ever to be suspended entirely.</p><p>&apos;One of the new directions taken by some composers after 1910 did<br/>involve the expansion of the pitch resources beyond the 12-tone<br/>tempered tuning system (or &quot;12-set&quot;), by way of simple subdivisions<br/>of that set (the quarter-tones, sixth-tones, etc. of Busoni, Ives,<br/>Hab&aacute;, Carillo, et al). But where these expansions were not<br/>harmonically based, they did notÂ—and indeed could notÂ—solve the<br/>problem that had arisen with the &quot;exhaustion&quot; of tonality. Thus, the<br/>music that was written in such tuning systems still required<br/>other &quot;organizing principles&quot; in order to maintain coherence. The<br/>failure of this music to solve the specifically harmonic problem was<br/>not due to any lack of skill, talent or vision on the part of these<br/>composers. These qualities most of them had in abundance. Their great<br/>expectations of what might be accomplished by such subdivisions of<br/>the 12-set were, however, the result of a misunderstanding of the<br/>basic nature of the 12-set itself. That is, this pitch set is not<br/>simply a useful or convenient (much less arbitrary_ &quot;division of the<br/>octave.&quot; More essentially, it is a pitch set which approximates<br/>certain just intervals (of the &quot;5-limit&quot;) fairly well (although it<br/>requires a tolerance range of about a seventh of a semitone for the<br/>ear to interpret the tempered major third in a triad as a just<br/>third). And the 12-set evolved historically in precisely that wayÂ—as<br/>a solution to the harmonic problem of tuning keyboard instruments in<br/>such a way that the important harmonic intervals would be available<br/>within a wide range of modulations of the tonic without encountering<br/>an intolerable &quot;wolf&quot; at some point. Thus, the 12-tone, equally-<br/>tempered scale was originally a harmonically based tuning system, and<br/>any extension of this system must also be harmonically based, if it<br/>is to have any effect on further developments of harmony.</p><p>&apos;The real problem with the 12-set, or course, is not the relatively<br/>small number of pitches it makes available, but the fact that a very<br/>large tolerance range has to be assumed even for it to be regarded as<br/>a &quot;fair approximation&quot; of the basic intervals of the 5-limitÂ—and even<br/>greater ranges are involved with those of the 7-and 11-limits.<br/>Although some &quot;progressive evolution&quot; of harmony is often suggested<br/>or implied in works by early 20th-century composers using this tuning<br/>system, it can only remain mere suggestion or implication. It can<br/>neither be made explicit, nor clarified, nor built upon, without<br/>going beyond the confines of the 12-set.</p><p>&apos;Partch&apos;s solution to these problems was to use just intervals only,<br/>and his work will stand for a long time as the most important<br/>pioneering exploration along the edges of this latest frontier. But<br/>other solutions are possible, including other temperaments, if these<br/>are &quot;harmonically based.&quot; In either case, our task now, as I see it ,<br/>is to investigate the unknown regions beyond this &quot;frontier,&quot;<br/>equipped with the resources already developed by Partch (and a few<br/>others: Lou Harrison and Ben Johnston have extended these resources<br/>quite considerably, and explored some of these regions) . . .&apos;</p><p>thanks to the boston microtonal society, and thanks to james tenney!</p></div><h3><a id=47298 href="#47298">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2003 9:59:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p> I tend to see the problem not as &apos;harmony&apos; but of &quot;gestalt&quot;. the problem is how to organize pitch<br/>in a way that we can group elements together as we see fit. Of the single systems, the Eikosany<br/>and the the CPS , that female counterpart to the diamond, is hard to surpass in that you have each<br/>tone capable of being in the full array of your set of different harmonic/subharmonic functions, a<br/>unique relationship to the whole, and a JI base to dispell any ambiguity. Temperments will always<br/>delay the real problem for later to pick up the pieces. It is how we have gotten in the mess we<br/>are in at the moment, by allowing ourselves to be coerced into a &apos;wall&apos; even though it is<br/>presented as a &apos;door&apos;. This isreally what all closed systerms are, walls. Thety solve problems is<br/>a very limited way, kind of the way our government deals with things, with the quick fix.. Closed<br/>systems are to be avoided at all cost, unless we don&apos;t care about what we expect others to deal<br/>with later. and they most surely will have to deal with it. Any closed system is an insult to the<br/>different ways people engage in real musical activity. The problems , And there are more than we<br/>will ever be able to name,  can only be solved with open systems and any system no capable of<br/>being reshaped, expanded, contrsacted, outright fragmented, is limited in any real vision for the<br/>future. Not only that will probably come back and bite it&apos;s creators on the vbehind.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Boston Microtonal Society website update<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i was interested to see james tenney&apos;s page<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://bostonmicrotonalsociety.org/Pages/MusiciansPages/Tenney.html">http://bostonmicrotonalsociety.org/Pages/MusiciansPages/Tenney.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=47320 href="#47320">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2003 3:58:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_47256.html#47270">/tuning/topicId_47256.html#47270</a></p><p>&gt; thanks to the boston microtonal society, and thanks to james tenney!</p><p>***I find this a little humorous, since the statements of Tenney seem<br/>to contradict the basic tenets of the &quot;added-tone non-harmonic-<br/>based&quot; microtonality that seemed to have emanated previously from<br/>these quarters... :)</p><p>J.
