In fact, Ellis published a<br/>quartertone trumpet method book.  By adding a single valve, a brass player<br/>can play much more than quartertones.</p><p>My good friend David Grego has built a quartertone tuba.  Right me privately<br/>and I will give you his phone number in Hoboken, New Jersey.  First he added<br/>a valve to a &quot;poor&quot; tuba and it improved it greatly.  He had been worried<br/>about ruining his instrument so he made a prototype.  Years later he is<br/>fluent on a great quartertone tuba.  As Ellis had found, the extra valve<br/>opens up the instrument.  It has a bigger sound.  And it gives most of the<br/>treasure trove of microtonal intervals.</p><p>Most modern trumpeters effect quartertones by having the right-hand pinkie<br/>remain on the slide, which they move expeditiously.  Louis Babin of Montreal,<br/>Quebec is quite adept at playing quartertone trumpet slide (as he is a<br/>composer of quartertone rooted music).</p><p>For complex varieties of microtones, I have successfully employed trumpeter<br/>John Charles Thomas (upstate, New York, but working in NYC).  While using a<br/>standard trumpet he can lip any microtonal interval or tuning because he has<br/>learned to hear in cents and can make the fine embouchure adjustments.</p><p>The actual placement of the valve is beyond my area of expertise.  Good luck<br/>in your odyssey!</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
