At what temperature does the plastic of a CDR melt or warp?<br/>2.  Can the photochemical reaction used to record a CDR also<br/>    be triggered by the unusually high heat of traditional paper-<br/>    temperature fire safes, during a house fire?  (If I remember<br/>    correctly, paper-temperature fire safes regulate the temperature<br/>    down to about 350F, whereas those for magnetic media hold<br/>    it down to about 150F.)</p></div>
