That&apos;s weird.  I asked Netscape to translate this message from<br/>HTML to raw text, but it came back to me in HTML.</p><p>   Well, anyway, here it is again in raw text (I hope!).</p><p>Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt;     Earlier I posed the question of what percentage of tuning listers can<br/>&gt; read an apparently-standard extended ASCII used by Netscape and<br/>&gt; Microsoft.  Or more specifically, I asked whether this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                   &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; looked like an umlaut-A followed by the Spanish enyeh (?) followed by the<br/>&gt; American cent symbol, all in curly quotes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Here&apos;s what I concluded based upon your replies:<br/>&gt; 9 people saw those characters exactly as my message described them.<br/>&gt; 2 people saw at least one character differently.<br/>&gt; 2 people looked at it using two programs, and read it successfully in one<br/>&gt; but not the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Here are some relevant comments from the folks who did see those<br/>&gt; symbols correctly:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    * &quot;I use CorelCENTRAL as jumpoff for the web and email.  No MAC,<br/>&gt;      &apos;just&apos; a PC.&quot;<br/>&gt;    * &quot;Pentium II, Windows 98, Microsoft Outlook Express&quot;<br/>&gt;    * &quot;Your example  ( &#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;)  came through perfectly to my Mac running<br/>&gt;      Netscape navigator 3.01.&quot;<br/>&gt;    * &quot;I&apos;m using Eudora on a Mac.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    And here are some relevant comments from the folks who did not see<br/>&gt; them as posted:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    * &quot;I get the right characters for all, except the quotes are two tiny<br/>&gt;      rectangles pointing upward.&quot;<br/>&gt;    *  &quot;Pine [didn&apos;t work]. It uses pico as an editor.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    So, my conclusion would be that, although it&apos;s probably preferable not<br/>&gt; to use these characters routinely, when they&apos;re inconvenient avoid, it<br/>&gt; seems likely that most tuning-listers will read them just fine.</p></div>
