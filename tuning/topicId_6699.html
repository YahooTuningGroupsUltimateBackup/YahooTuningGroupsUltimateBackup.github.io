It<br/>&gt; seems to be a contradiction in terms.  They are all part of<br/>&gt; the smorgasbord that Ives flirts with.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, this was just an afterthought I had while I was pondering<br/>Ives&apos;s use of both D# and Eb in that scale diagram.</p><p>It struck me that, except for the top Eb in that 1/8-tone<br/>scale, all the other chromatic semitones were marked as sharps.<br/>(Of course, that&apos;s assuming that was what published is<br/>exactly what Ives wrote.)</p><p>This gave me the thought that perhaps Ives was thinking of<br/>the chromatic scale he outlined as his basis, and called the<br/>&apos;old scale&apos;, in Pythagorean terms rather than in 12-tET.</p><p>So for that particular posting, I calculated all the<br/>micro-intervals as subdivisions of a Pythagorean 12-tone<br/>scale - actually 13-tone including the Eb, because it&apos;s<br/>a Pythagorean comma flatter than D#.</p><p>I have no argument beyond that for this interpretation.<br/>It was just an idea.</p><p>Actually, I probably thought of it because it&apos;s very much<br/>along the lines of my new interpretation of Aristoxenus&apos;s<br/>intervals.</p><p>BTW, in my Tuning Digest this morning, that last diagram<br/>(on Ives) *did* get mangled by extra carriage returns being<br/>inserted, as I had prophesied might happen.  Sorry about that.<br/>The diagram can be seen correctly on my webpage:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ives/48tet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ives/48tet.htm</a></p><p>Can anyone give me the information for the book from which<br/>I copied this diagram?  Is it the _Memos_, or is it some<br/>other book containing Ives&apos;s writings?  I have the _Essays<br/>Before a Sonata_, and I thought those two were the only<br/>ones.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
