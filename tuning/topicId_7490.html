And as I&apos;ve stumbled -- often<br/>painfully and awkwardly -- my way through trying to learn how to both<br/>use the computer (email etc., *etc.*) and best participate in this<br/>(very new to me) sort of a public or group discussion I feel that I<br/>have learnt a lot (even if it doesn&apos;t always show the way I might hope<br/>that it would).</p><p>I had found out about (and joined) the TD on the advice of Neil<br/>Haverstick, and up until that point I had only the slightest smidgen<br/>of a perspective on tuning theory and tuning history, and I personally<br/>think that the daily back and forth of this forum is a wonderful way<br/>to accelerate an understanding of this topic: If you have specific<br/>questions, ask... your bound to get some useful feedback. And if some<br/>(or a lot) of what is discussed here seems difficult to get a handle<br/>on, and you don&apos;t quite know how to best formulate questions about it,<br/>stick around... most topics are repeatedly (and somewhat cyclically)<br/>gone over and over again, and it has been my experience that most all<br/>of them are easy enough for most anyone (who desires to do so) to<br/>eventually get a handle on.</p><p>I had a pretty good heap of tuning ideas and ways of going about<br/>things long before I joined the TD, and though these are still my<br/>primary interest and ways of going about things (rather than a<br/>thoroughgoing understanding of tuning and it&apos;s history), I&apos;m really<br/>very grateful for what I&apos;ve been able to technically pick up and<br/>better understand from the frequent theory oriented postings of folks<br/>such as Erlich, Keenan, Lumma, Monzo, Hahn (and anyone else I&apos;m<br/>forgetting to mention) here at the TD.</p><p>I&apos;ve also (hopefully...) learned a fair bit about better interacting<br/>with such a large group of fairly diversified opinions and interests<br/>in this (sometimes difficult and often curious) interactive<br/>communication medium... and as I&apos;ve always been more than a bit<br/>stubborn and never much of one to shun a good fight, it took me a<br/>couple of regrettable yelling and yapping fits (my belated apologies<br/>to Pat Pagano and Ray Tomes...) to learn that this was not the way I<br/>that I either wanted to interact with people or conduct myself...</p><p>So as I wrap-up a year here at the TD, I&apos;m mostly just thrilled to<br/>know that there is indeed an active place that I can turn to keep my<br/>hand on the microtonal pulse so to speak... a place to satisfy my own<br/>curiosities, get a better generalized picture of what&apos;s going on, and<br/>occasionally roll out my own ideas, music, and whatnot to what is<br/>probably going to be one of their more receptive audiences... It&apos;s<br/>been a joy and a continued learning experience - my thanks to everyone<br/>who&apos;s made it so.</p><p>(looking forward to another productive year at the TD), Dan</p></div>
