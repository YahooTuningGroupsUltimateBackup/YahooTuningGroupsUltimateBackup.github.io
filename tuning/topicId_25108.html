There have been<br/>suggestions posted recently as to how to access .bin files.</p><p>BTW I&apos;ve just wriggled out of my little tartan number having played the<br/>Mary Queen of Scots gig and guess what? - nobody came up to me and said<br/>&quot;you&apos;re playing in 12 tet there - very authentic&quot;. Such a lack of<br/>awareness in the civic dignitaries of Scotland.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2001 1:07:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Treebird is the story of that bird:-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3/treebird.mp3.bin">http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3/treebird.mp3.bin</a></p><p>When I renamed this without the &apos;.bin&apos;, and tried playing it, there<br/>were only a few seconds of music, just a few percussive tones,<br/>descending.
