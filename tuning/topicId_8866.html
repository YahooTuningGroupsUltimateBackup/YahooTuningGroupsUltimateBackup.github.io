I,<br/>for one, enjoy stretching the current limits of jazz by performing it in<br/>19eq...it gives the chord changes a nice twist, familiar but strange,<br/>and is a good challenge for one&apos;s technique as well. Starrett and I have<br/>plans for doing standard style jazz in 31. To me, being able to modulate<br/>is the strong suit of eq temps; that&apos;s what they do best. I like writing<br/>pieces with lots of chord changes, so eq temps are a natural. On another<br/>note, I rehearsed with a Japanese koto/samisen player yesterday for an<br/>upcoming show...she has a good grasp of the differences in pitch between<br/>Japanese music and Western 12 eq. We are going to do a samisen/fretless<br/>guitar improv, and hearing her play a minor scale with slightly flatted<br/>pitches was a hoot...I plan on learning a lot...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=55684 href="#55684">ðŸ”—</a>traktus5 &#x3C;kj4321@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2004 10:11:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hello group.

In<br/>fact its openness (even infiniteness) is considered by many to be one of its<br/>key features (aside from harmony), so that you are free to go into as large<br/>a lattice of pitches as your music requires.  This *is* a potentially<br/>infinite resource, and although finite in any actual use, the finiteness is<br/>sometimes you might say only limited by the length of the piece.  And some<br/>pieces do in fact push this pretty far.  You can find this for example in<br/>Toby Twining&apos;s Crysalid Requiem.  Personally I may have never known this by<br/>listening to it but since I read the article on it in the previous issue of<br/>1/1 I know this piece modulates very far from its original set of pitches.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=55699 href="#55699">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2004 7:44:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>traktus5 wrote:<br/>&gt; hello group.

But you can just as easily do modulation with other kinds of symmetrical temperaments.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid</a></p><p>The difference is that you usually can&apos;t modulate all the way around the circle and come back to where you started, like you can with equal temperaments. (Although some temperaments do allow you to modulate in circles to a limited extent; there are temperaments that repeat at the quarter octave, for instance.)</p><p>Of course, the limits of modulation are only a problem for instruments with a limited number of fixed pitches; you can modulate as far as you like in just intonation with flexible pitch instruments (like fretless strings) or voices. And after a while in a large JI lattice you reach a point where you&apos;re so close to your starting point that you can ignore the small difference and treat it as a &quot;unison vector&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=55700 href="#55700">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2004 12:21:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kelly,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; &lt;kj4321@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 31?
