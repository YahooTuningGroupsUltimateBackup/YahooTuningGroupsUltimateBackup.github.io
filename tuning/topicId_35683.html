Of course it does. That&apos;s the point.

That&apos;s also what makes it so interesting.<br/>&gt;&gt; Apparently, the illusionary high third only appears when the three elements<br/>&gt;&gt; (root, fifth and third) are in perfect JI tuning (2:3:5, 4:5:6 and possibly<br/>&gt;&gt; other arrangements). So, when an actual high third is sung into  a perfectly<br/>&gt;&gt; tuned fifth (2:3) it doesn&apos;t produce a &quot;higher&quot; third. It simply &quot;sounds<br/>&gt;&gt; good.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; i can&apos;t think of any known or postulated psychoacoustic effect that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; would explain an observation like this.</p><p>Did you remember what I said earlier?

So let&apos;s postulate one. I&apos;m just telling you what I have  experienced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not exactly -- you&apos;re talking about singing &apos;into&apos; a heard pitch as<br/>&gt; if it takes place without hearing, via the same hearing mechanism,<br/>&gt; the sung pitch. this sounds like a logical fallacy. and it&apos;s in your<br/>&gt; *interpretation* of what you experienced -- the experience itself had<br/>&gt; to involve a single, coherent hearing mechanism.</p><p>Are you saying that one can&apos;t hear two things at the same time? The phrase<br/>&quot;singing in tune&quot; implies adjusting one&apos;s voice to &quot;fit&quot; with another sound<br/>source. That&apos;s what I did in this case. I repeat: when I sang &quot;my version&quot;<br/>of the JI third with jerry00 there was no pitch difference in our thirds<br/>when the root and fifth dropped out; but when I sang the high third (which<br/>*also* tuned with the apparent high third being produced by the JI triad)<br/>there was a strong dissonance when the root and third dropped out.

Do you remember the sources of your info about &quot;categorical<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; perception&quot;? Who knows? I might even understand some of it.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; back at college, i used to sit in the library all day, every day,<br/>&gt;&gt; reading this stuff -- psychology journals, acoustics journals,<br/>&gt;&gt; as well as everything in the music library -- unfortunately, this<br/>&gt;&gt; particular area was not one in which i retained many names and dates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; let me give you an example of &apos;categorical perception&apos; at work in a<br/>&gt; different context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the japanese language has no &apos;l&apos; sound or &apos;r&apos; sound, but rather a<br/>&gt; single sound in-between the two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; people who grow up speaking japanese can&apos;t hear the difference<br/>&gt; between the english &apos;l&apos; and &apos;r&apos; -- they simply hear both as the<br/>&gt; single sound they&apos;re familiar with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s extremely difficult to train native japanese speakers to hear<br/>&gt; the difference between what, to us, are completely different sounds.</p><p>Thanks, Paul. This helps me to know what you mean by the phrase. I wonder if<br/>a speaker of Japanese would hear a difference (contrast, dissonance,<br/>whatever) if he/she sustained the sound of the Japanese vowel while hearing<br/>an American R or L. In our experiment, the focus is largely on simultaneous<br/>sounds rather then simply recognizing different ones in isolation.</p><p>It&apos;s fairly obvious to me that we tend to &quot;force&quot; perceptions to fit into<br/>whatever &quot;concepts&quot; we have collected over a lifetime. You know...the old<br/>&quot;all (pick an ethnic group) look alike&quot; nonsense. That&apos;s likely what makes<br/>it possible for many &quot;musicians&quot; to reduce everything they hear to 12t-ET.<br/>That&apos;s also why many readers of my books have no frigging idea what I&apos;m<br/>talking about.</p><p>The &quot;cure&quot; then would be a matter of assimilating more and better &quot;concepts&quot;<br/>with which to perceive the differences we&apos;re talking about. I think there<br/>are a great many pitch-sensitive people out there who know they are hearing<br/>something other than 12t-ET. Many of these send me emails telling me how<br/>welcome my writing is to them. Very gratifying. What&apos;s more, I haven&apos;t found<br/>the student yet who can&apos;t learn to hear good JI tuning. It&apos;s the<br/>stuck-in-the-mud teachers who are frightened to death that they will have to<br/>abandon their precious and well-worn course outlines and favorite textbooks<br/>if they allow themselves to take me seriously.</p><p>But I digress. Are you suggesting that I (and evidently scores of others)<br/>may have developed a categorical perception when it comes to hearing the<br/>high third? If so, the &quot;concept&quot; by which I perceive it is a rather specific<br/>one since the jerries vary in their closeness to it. I&apos;ll be interesting to<br/>see if one of your next series of jerries &quot;nails&quot; it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; here&apos;s a paper that mentions categorical perception and a bit about<br/>&gt; its musical implications for musicians vs. nonmusicians:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/rgoldsto/pdfs/perlearn.pdf">http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/rgoldsto/pdfs/perlearn.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; here&apos;s an interesting paper that relates the possible effect of<br/>&gt; categorical perception in a different culture, one where musicians<br/>&gt; recognize five, rather than twelve, distinct categories within an<br/>&gt; octave:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/ReadingRoom/Newsletters/EthnoMusicolo">http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/ReadingRoom/Newsletters/EthnoMusicolo</a><br/>&gt; gy/Archive/cooke-paper</p><p>I have downloaded these, Paul, and will get to them right away.
