 so *thats* what harmony<br/>is about!&quot; :)</p><p>the problem i had with this list -- and why i stopped reading<br/>it for a while -- is that the discussions here are *so* arcane!<br/>i always thought i *liked* music theory, and i liked technical<br/>arcana, but you all are in a whole different league.  at first,<br/>a few years ago, it was all very intriguing, and i tried learning<br/>to follow the discussions here.  but i had a very hard time<br/>getting a bead on most of it, so i ended up discouraged to<br/>the point of not reading the list anymore.</p><p>but before i stopped reading completely, i asked for advice<br/>on basic level books from which i might get a groundwork.<br/>i ended up getting two books.  &quot;genesis of a music&quot;, of course...<br/>which i found a fun read, and interesting.  i learned stuff,<br/>but i still didn&apos;t really *get* a lot of the fundamental<br/>concepts.  the other book i got was &quot;the harmonic experience&quot;.<br/>now that is a long and weighty book.  it&apos;s taken me well over<br/>a year of digging through it to reach what seems like a deep<br/>sense of the basis of harmony -- but it&apos;s happened!  and that&apos;s<br/>what&apos;s drawn me back to this list.  i have a new respect and<br/>understanding of both just intonation and equal temperment<br/>and am eager to explore them more.</p><p>i still won&apos;t be able to follow *most* of the technical discussions<br/>here, and i&apos;m not sure i want to anyway.  but i do have a lot of<br/>ideas and questions, and hope to learn more.  seems that i am<br/>not especially interested in theory unless i see a way that<br/>i could apply it to making music.  sometimes i get a kick out<br/>of the arcane jargon just for its own sake.  the language<br/>and terminology that gets flung around this list is kinda<br/>fun to see sometimes.  like a little window on an alien science.<br/>but mostly i&apos;m really only interested in what has direct<br/>application to my own music making.</p><p>my mind tends to blank out when i see long strings of numbers.<br/>in fact, one of the epiphanies i recently had regarding just<br/>intonation is that i can *hear* math.  written math has always<br/>seemed somehow unreal to me.  geometry made sense because i<br/>could see it.  and now i&apos;m finding i can understand math<br/>through hearing it!  it&apos;s a stunning realization.</p><p>one thing i&apos;m wondering about is -- how do people create music in<br/>just intonation?  i have synthesizers that offer &apos;pythagorean&apos;<br/>or &apos;just C&apos; tunings.  they are, i assume, a way to explore (correct<br/>my terminology if i am wrong) a 12-note 5-limit lattice.<br/>people here talk about using just tuned guitars.  do those<br/>also tend to a 12-note 5-limit space?  this seems an interesting<br/>harmonic space to explore -- and certainly useful for learning<br/>to hear &apos;in tune&apos;, but the space of just intonation seems so<br/>potentially large, and 12 notes seems rather small.<br/>how do people explore the larger lattices?  have people<br/>created instruments (acoustic, computer or otherwise) that<br/>allow them to improvise in a large just lattice?  or do you<br/>tend to work out the music mathematically on paper and then<br/>enter the data into a program like csound?</p><p>not being much of a programmer (the same problem as with math --<br/>strings of ascii code = blank mind), csound was always daunting to me.<br/>but i have gotten the hang of using max/msp to do sound programming.<br/>recently inspired by just intonation, i wrote a program.  i just<br/>wanted to hear what various low prime ratios sounded like.<br/>i didn&apos;t care too much to systemtically identify them one by one --<br/>&quot;now let&apos;s hear a 7/5...&quot;  i just wanted to get my ear used to<br/>hearing *any* low prime ratios, without necessarily knowing<br/>intellectually which one was currently sounding.  the program i<br/>wrote has 8 voice-modules, each of which can play a single note.<br/>the notes play with a long slow envelope.  the program is seeded<br/>with a reference tonic pitch.  each module uses the tonic pitch<br/>to randomly calculate a new note in the range [1-13] / [1-13].<br/>then each voices plays its note at random time intervals.<br/>they also occassionally recalculate a new pitch.  all voices<br/>are sine waves.</p><p>the result is a slowly-changing, dreamy music that drifts from<br/>quite attractive consonances to rather sharp dissonances.<br/>sometimes it sounds &apos;tonal&apos;, other times &apos;atonal&apos;.  the<br/>voices repeat themselves just enough to make stable harmonic<br/>spaces that slowly transform into new ones.  i just made it<br/>as a kind of &apos;test&apos;, but was surprised by how much i enjoyed<br/>listening to it, i&apos;ve even slept with it on -- the slow dreamy<br/>qualities seem ideal for sleeping.  now, having made it, i&apos;ve<br/>gotten many ideas for how to modify and expand on it, but,<br/>unfortunately, it already taxes my cpu to its very limit. :/<br/>someday i would like to get a kyma synthesizer...</p><p>i&apos;m curious if other people have done things like this.<br/>seems like a potentially good way to explore a just lattice<br/>that extends far behind 12-notes and 5-limit.</p><p>well, that&apos;s all i have time for right now.  i&apos;m curious<br/>how people create music with just intonation.  do you<br/>compose on paper?  improvise on a just tuned instrument?<br/>i&apos;m especially interested in how people use computers<br/>to work in just intonation.  do you come up with a concept<br/>and then systematically program it?  or do you make<br/>interactive programs/instruments?</p><p>thanks, and hello!  paul</p></div>
