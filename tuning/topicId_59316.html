This gives you a prime-mapping to try. You then apply that<br/>prime-mapping to every ratio of the scale (relative to 1/1) and see<br/>that you get consective numbers of steps.</p><p>Here&apos;s some more tutorial for those unfamiliar with what it means to<br/>&quot;apply a prime mapping&quot;.</p><p>To apply a prime mapping to a ratio you first find the ratio&apos;s prime<br/>factors and list the exponent of each prime (the number of times the<br/>prime occurs in the prime factorisation, with those on the bottom of<br/>the ratio shown as negative). This is the prime-exponent-vector for<br/>the ratio. Then multiply each prime-exponent by the corresponding<br/>number of steps in the prime-mapping and add up all those products to<br/>get the number of steps for the ratio.</p><p>For example consider the prime-mapping</p><p>&lt;12 19, 28]        (Notice the angle-bracket points to the left)</p><p>This happens to be the standard 5-limit prime-mapping for 12-ET)<br/>It means that the octave 1:2 is approximated by 12 generators (in this<br/>case steps of the ET), and 1:3 (an octave and fifth) is approximated<br/>by 19 steps (12 + 7), and 1:5 (two octaves and a major third) by 28<br/>steps (12+12+4).</p><p>Now consider the ratio 25/24. Its prime factorisation is</p><p>5 * 5<br/>-------------<br/>2 * 2 * 2 * 3</p><p>So can be written as 2^-3 * 3^-1 * 5^2 or more simply as the<br/>prime-exponent-vector</p><p>[-3 -1, 2&gt;        (Notice the angle-bracket points to the right)</p><p>One way of remembering that angle-brackets are &quot;mappings left,<br/>exponents right&quot;, is to note that when we write say 5 to the power of<br/>2, we put the exponent on the right, 5^2. Another way is to notice<br/>that applying a mapping is like applying a function (such as sine,<br/>cosine or square-root) and when we write those we usually write the<br/>function to the left.</p><p>Now to apply the above mapping to this ratio we can use the &quot;dot<br/>product&quot; notation and write:</p><p>&lt;12 19, 28].[-3 -1, 2&gt;</p><p>which is just the sum of the products of the corresponding entries</p><p>12*-3 + 19*-1 + 28*2</p><p>= 1</p><p>I note that since we&apos;re usually dealing with octave-equivalent scales<br/>we often ignore the exponents of 2 and just perform our arithmetic<br/>modulo the number of steps per octave. In which case the above mapping<br/>can be written in octave-equivalent form as</p><p>&lt;7, 4]</p><p>i.e. 7 steps per 2:3 fifth and 4 steps per 4:5 major third</p><p>And in octave-equivalent form the ratio 25/24 is</p><p>[-1, 2&gt;</p><p>Note that the comma is always after the 3 exponent (and then every<br/>third place after that) so we know whether we are looking at a full<br/>exponent vector or an octave-equivalent one.</p><p>Then we have &lt;7, 4].[-1, 2&gt; = 7*-1 + 4*2 = 1</p><p>This is the same answer as before. If the answer had been outside the<br/>range 0 to 11 we would have added or subtracted octaves (12&apos;s in this<br/>case) to bring it back to that range.</p><p>Further discussion</p><p>The definition of &quot;constant structure&quot; in Monz&apos;s encyclopedia is that<br/>a scale or tuning has (or is a) constant structure if every instance<br/>of the same size interval (in cents or as a ratio) spans the same<br/>number of scale steps. e.g. all 2:3 fifths might span 7 steps etc.</p><p>It seems to me that this might well be equivalent to &quot;epimorphic&quot;, in<br/>the case of rational tunings. Is that right Gene? Maybe I missed the<br/>counterexample.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2005 9:28:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dave,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Gene<br/>&gt; &gt;  I have no means in which to decipher this<br/>&gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then it is epimorphic with val<br/>&gt; &gt; h if h(s[i]) = i, where s[i] is the ith scale element.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What a sense of humour.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it is in English. ;-)</p><p>Thanks *SO MUCH* for this nice tutorial!<br/>It certainly helps me a lot.</p><p>With your permission, i&apos;d like to add it to<br/>the Encyclopedia in some form.</p><p>&gt; I note that since we&apos;re usually dealing with<br/>&gt; octave-equivalent scales we often ignore the exponents<br/>&gt; of 2 and just perform our arithmetic modulo the number<br/>&gt; of steps per octave.

So algebra was out of the question. But sure, if<br/>you&apos;re doing it automatically you&apos;d keep the 2&apos;s.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s clear epimorphic ==&gt; constant structure. For the reverse<br/>&gt; implication, we need that CS is a strong enough condition to force<br/>&gt; a solution to {h(s[i])-i} for some h, not necessarily uniquely. For a<br/>&gt; counterexample, consider the &quot;scale&quot; [1,4375/4374,2401/2400].<br/>...</p><p>It would be good if you could give a counterexample with much smaller<br/>numbers and more realistic intervals so it&apos;s easy for the algebraicly<br/>challenged to see _why_ it is a constant structure but not epimorphic.</p><p>-- Dave</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2005 3:05:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;Prime exponent vector&quot; suggests that the notes of JI constitute a<br/>&gt; vector space, not an abelian group, so I think the phrase is both<br/>&gt; clumbersome and not altogether accurate. &quot;Prime mapping&quot; is not<br/>&gt; usable, since we use that phrase for mappings which map to things<br/>&gt; other than the integers, consisting of more than one val; the obvious<br/>&gt; example being the map to period and generator. Moreover, to say that<br/>&gt; it is obfuscation overlooks the fact that it is a fundamental<br/>&gt; theoretical concept, which having a specialist term helps to drive<br/>&gt; home. If you are going to interest yourself in tuning theory you need<br/>&gt; the concept in some form, and neither &quot;homomorphism from a free<br/>&gt; subgroup of finite rank of the positive rational numbers under<br/>&gt; multiplication to the integers&quot; nor &quot;finite Z-linear combination of<br/>&gt; additive padic valuations&quot; strike me as likely to elicit either<br/>&gt; understanding or enthusiasm. Recall, this was the sort of language I<br/>&gt; used when I first arrived on these lists, to bad reviews. Using &quot;val&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;monzo&quot; and the bra-ket notation seems to have resulted in far<br/>&gt; greater understanding that what we started out with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The bottom line is, it works.</p><p>All of this may be valid if you&apos;re talking to other mathematicians,<br/>for example on the tuning-math list, but on this list it&apos;s all<br/>irrelevant. Most readers of this list will not be confused by the<br/>difference between a vector space and an abelian group since they have<br/>no idea what either of them is, and don&apos;t need to. And I think it has<br/>been explained to you before now that it is the engineering or<br/>geometric meaning of &quot;vector&quot; that is alluded to here, not the algebraic.</p><p>And I didn&apos;t claim that &quot;prime mapping&quot; was a synonym for your &quot;val&quot;<br/>in any case other than the one under discussion. Surely, even in your<br/>terms, a prime mapping _can_ consist of a single &quot;val&quot;, i.e. in the<br/>case of ETs, which is what was under discussion.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2005 6:46:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
