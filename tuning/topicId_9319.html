Hence, I<br/>was<br/>&gt;looking to you for ideas.</p><p>I guess I would start by learning the triads that are consonant in the<br/>15-limit; these would simply be the 3-member subsets of the 8 otonal octads<br/>and the 8 utonal octads. Then the tetrads; there you would have the 4-member<br/>subsets of the octads, as well as the &quot;anomalous&quot; ones: 12:14:18:21,<br/>22:24:33:36, 24:26:36:39, 12:14:15:21, and 20:28:30:35. Do all of those<br/>occur in the diamond? Find them.</p></div>
