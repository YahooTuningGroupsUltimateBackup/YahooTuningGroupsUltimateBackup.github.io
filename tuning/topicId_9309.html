But as that was about six months ago -- and as the CD has just<br/>now come out -- I&apos;ve decided to posted it again for anyone who might<br/>be interested.</p><p>Neil Haverstick -- &quot;OTHER WORLDS&quot;</p><p>If your familiar with the electric 19-tone blues rock of Neil&apos;s first<br/>CD &quot;THE GATE&quot;, or the wonderful 19 &amp; 34-tone acoustic jazz fusion of<br/>&quot;ACOUSTIC STICK,&quot; this new CD may come as a bit of a surprise.</p><p>&quot;OTHER WORLDS&quot; has of four longish cuts that consist primarily of<br/>layered guitar synths in a sound that I would describe as being<br/>something like a cross between the early space music of say Klause<br/>Schultz, and the wonderfully icy sound of some of the early ECM<br/>records/artists - say Terje Rypdal&apos;s &quot;AFTER THE RAIN&quot; for example.</p><p>The general tone of these pieces, while often somewhat somber, is also<br/>pretty severe... and in this sense &quot;OTHER WORLDS&quot; could also be said<br/>to have a lot in common with the otherworldly electronic sounds and<br/>imagery of the classic Sci-Fi flick.</p><p>As far as specific tunings are concerned, tracks 1, 2 and 4 feature<br/>34, 19 and 12-tone equal temperament respectively, and track 3<br/>features an overdubbed duet with Neil on fretless guitar synth and<br/>John Starrett on the StarrBoard. But with all the various phasing and<br/>echo (etc.) effects going on, the music&apos;s emphasis is not really<br/>contingent on any specific tuning per say, but rather on the overall<br/>sense of otherworldliness... and to that end, the alternate tunings<br/>certainly do contribute heartily.</p><p>One of the most impressive aspects of this CD for me was that these<br/>longish and largely texture based pieces succeed in accomplishing a<br/>continued sense of direction and organic development - they have real<br/>compositional arches so to speak... and with running times of 17:02,<br/>10:55, 10:37 and 17:57, I personally found this to be most appealing.<br/>Check it out!</p><p>Dan Stearns</p></div>
