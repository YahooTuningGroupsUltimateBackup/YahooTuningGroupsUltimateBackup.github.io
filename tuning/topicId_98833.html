Rather than me laying the whole thing out,<br/>I&apos;ll just leave it at that the C goes to F for a little while, and<br/>then eventually goes back to the Bb. So the Cmaj at the end is<br/>supposed to land you the equivalent of 9/8 up where you started.</p><p>If each of those whole step motions is 9/8, and each of the minor<br/>third motions is 6/5, am I correct in stating that this would be a<br/>3486784401/3355443200 comma pump?</p><p>Of course, if you make the whole steps so that one of them is 9/8 and<br/>the other is 10/9, so that two adjacent whole step motions spans 5/4<br/>total, and also make the minor third motions 6/5, then the whole thing<br/>works out to be a 2025/2048 pump instead, which makes more sense. But<br/>I like the sound of them both moving by 9/8, because the melody makes<br/>each of those maj7 chords effectively into maj9 chords, so it&apos;s<br/>smoother. The above ridiculous comma is, I think, 2025/2048 *<br/>(81/80)^4 or something like that.</p><p>Lastly, in this video, after going to F, instead of going back to the<br/>Bb, they go back to the Bmaj7 instead, over which they play Lydian. So<br/>the F turns into the E# from B lydian. This is also a diaschismatic<br/>comma pump, I think. Maybe the takehome point is that the whole thing<br/>works best if both 2025/2048 and 81/80 vanish, so you end up with a<br/>comma pump that&apos;s based in a rank 1 temperament, not a rank 2<br/>temperament.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
