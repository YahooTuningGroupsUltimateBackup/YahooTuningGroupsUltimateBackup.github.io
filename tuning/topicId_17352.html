I also haven&apos;t heard Ed Foote&apos;s CD, and I&apos;d be curious to<br/>know what works appear on it, but short of that, I&apos;d have to agree more with<br/>Monz on the subject of Beethoven and ET.<br/>Two characterstic Beethoven figures lend themselves to ET, in my opinion:<br/>The first would be long, fast chromatic runs, almost like slow glisses. As<br/>Paul pointed out, these would sound smoother on an ET keyboard. A good<br/>example of a long, fast, descending chromatic run in Beethoven would be near<br/>the end of his very famous, untitled sonatina commonly referred to as &quot;Fur<br/>Elise.&quot;<br/>The second characteristic figure that would lend itself to equal temperment<br/>in my mind would be Beethoven&apos;s use of parallel thirds, as in his &quot;Turkish<br/>March.&quot; I can&apos;t really see (or hear) parallel thirds in a subject working<br/>well when restated after a modulation on a non-ET keyboard.<br/>I would also bet that any relationship between Beethoven and ET would show<br/>up much more in his piano works than in his symphonic pieces, simply because<br/>intonation is completely fixed on the piano, and much more fluid in an<br/>orchestra. I also know that Beethoven was one of the first to exploit the<br/>capabilities of a new breed of piano that became available in his lifetime.<br/>These newer pianos were the first to have cast-iron frames, making higher<br/>string tension and greater dynamic range possible. It would be interesting<br/>to research whether these newer pianos were primarily tuned ET or not.</p><p>Todd</p></div><h3>Paul H.

The well-temperaments in use in Beethoven&apos;s day (equal<br/>temperament was not tuned on a piano with any accuracy until after his<br/>death) would support the effects you mention quite well -- chromaticism<br/>within a harmonic context, and motivic parallel thirds in all keys. Foote&apos;s<br/>CD uses some extreme well-temperaments whose pairings with the pieces seem<br/>almost arbitrary, yet the music doesn&apos;t suffer at all -- it merely gains a<br/>little color.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2001 6:04:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17410">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17410</a></p><p>&gt; As a rule of thumb during most of the 20th century, the<br/>&gt; less trained the musician, the more microtonal the performance.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ha ha.
