I bought this ten pipe set used, and<br/>all the labels were worn off.</p><p>I used info from this list, plus what labels remained, and a little guess work to arrive at the<br/>following.</p><p>From largest to smallest size:<br/>3/2  8/5  5/3  16/9  1/1  9/8   6/5  5/4  4/3  3/2</p><p>Would someone, who has experience with these chimes, like to verify the accuracy of these<br/>numbers?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Bekah<br/><a href="http://www.childsgarden.com">http://www.childsgarden.com</a></p></div>
