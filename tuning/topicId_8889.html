I&apos;ll be making a detailed webpage<br/>explaining its tuning when I&apos;m resettled.  It has 3 different<br/>sizes of frets which go straight across the neck: 70 cents,<br/>85 cents, and 115 cents, in this repeating pattern:</p><p>||    |     |    |     |     |    |     |<br/>|| 70 | 115 | 85 | 115 | 115 | 85 | 115 |<br/>||    |     |    |     |     |    |     |</p><p>Most of you should be able to see right away some<br/>of the just ratios that it approximates well.  The tuning of the<br/>open strings is completely &apos;user-definable&apos;, but Robin generally<br/>uses tunings which produce a nice rich JI chord on the open strings.<br/>Robin&apos;s approach is to use temperaments which closely approach JI<br/>but are easy to fret on the guitar, and he calls it &apos;just-about<br/>intonation&apos;.</p><p>Robin showed me another refretted guitar that was even more<br/>interesting, in which the 12-EDO &apos;5th&apos; was divided into 6 equal<br/>parts, giving each fret a step-size of (2^(7/12))^(1/6), or<br/>exactly 116&amp;2/3 cents.  The frets on this guitar thus do not<br/>give &apos;octaves&apos;, the closest intervals to an &apos;octave&apos; being<br/>1166&amp;2/3 cents and 1283&amp;1/3 cents.</p><p>Friday night I visited Jacky Ligon in North Carolina.  Jacky has<br/>not yet subscribed to the Tuning List, but most likely will be<br/>signing on very soon as a result of my encouragement.  He&apos;s a<br/>big fan of my work (both the theory and the compositions), and<br/>has recorded some excellent stuff himself.  He uses either sampled<br/>sounds or patches he programs himself, and always in JI.  He&apos;s<br/>very much into Indian music, and a lot of his own pieces reflect<br/>that interest.</p><p>Right now I&apos;m visiting Ken Fasano in Georgia, and making huge<br/>strides on improving the functionality of my JustMusic software.</p><p>I&apos;ll be at SEJIC (to see Darren Burgess, Pat Pagano and the rest<br/>of the gang) Monday night and Tuesday, and then again over the<br/>next weekend, then on to Mobile (Can Akkoc), New Orleans (Derle<br/>Long), and Austin (Gary Morrison, John Loffink, Chris Chapman),<br/>which will be another rather long stop-over.</p><p>Are there any microtonalists between Austin and Phoenix???<br/>El Paso would make a great place to stop and &apos;talk shop&apos;.<br/>Also, I&apos;d love to hear from any microtonalists in southern<br/>New Mexico and Arizona - email me privately at this address<br/><a href="mailto:joemonz@yahoo.com">joemonz@yahoo.com</a><br/>if interested in a visit.  I&apos;ll be spending at least one night<br/>in Phoenix, and also hope to see where Harry Partch lived in<br/>New Orleans, Benson AZ, and Phoenix.</p><p>-monz (on road trip 2000)</p><p>______________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=8890 href="#8890">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2000 2:09:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe Monzo wrote:</p><p>&gt; -monz (on road trip 2000)</p><p>Is there a possibility you&apos;ll be seling t-shirts<br/>and ball caps that say:</p><p>    MONZ<br/>ROAD TRIP 2000</p><p>?</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
