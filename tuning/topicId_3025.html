I&apos;ve been trying to get this for ages!!<br/>My project involving brain-waves to music has never been put into practice,<br/>it is theory only. But it has been done: I have a videoclip of Cathy Lee<br/>Crosby being wired up to a machine that used her EEG output to trigger rows<br/>of analogue synths. The result was not the sort of thing one easily<br/>describes as music, unless you&apos;re into extreme avant-garde, but it was<br/>delightfully unpedictable, and, as Cathy Lee pointed out afterwards, it was<br/>all her own composition.<br/>    My idea was to take it the logical step further and hook the output of a<br/>biofeedback machine, which detects waves emanating from the superficial<br/>neocortex, through a bank of 16 CV-to-MIDI converters (one for each MIDI<br/>channel), and plug &apos;em into multitimbral synths, samplers, whathaveyou. It<br/>would be like using a guitar or drum controller to play a MIDI appliance,<br/>except the controller would be one&apos;s own cerebral electrical potentials -<br/>brain waves. Again, I do not think anything musically useful would result.<br/>The neocortex puts out regular 2 - 5 Hz alpha waves as electricity sweeps<br/>across it while in a relaxed but awake mode; faster 10 Hz waves in the<br/>excited &quot;beta&quot; state. and slow, high-voltage waves in the &quot;theta&quot; stage of<br/>sleep. Deeper in the brain, areas like the hippocampus, thalamic nuclei,<br/>medulla, reticular formation, etc., have their own rhythms controlled by<br/>clusters of cells arranged in ganglia. None of these rhythms conform in any<br/>sense with the laws of music; it would be like tapping into the ignition<br/>system of your car with a MIDI device. Also, there is no way - yet - of<br/>tapping the &quot;music in your head&quot; phenomenon: that is a result of memory<br/>engrams triggering parts of the auditory cortex, making it release sound<br/>data into the conscious mind in a complex, and indeciphered, code. Rather<br/>like a digital sampler encoding sound into a binary format. Only if<br/>scientists could unlock the brain&apos;s incredibly complex codes could we plug<br/>our minds into a loudspeaker and hear someone&apos;s mental music.<br/>    What on Earth is a &quot;hyper-computer&quot;? Please elucidate. Cheers, Keith.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/14/1999 7:38:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sarn Richard Ursell &lt;<a href="mailto:thcdelta@pop.ihug.co.nz">thcdelta@pop.ihug.co.nz</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;... intending to be doing some experimenting with brainwaves and music.<br/>&gt;...</p><p>If the operation is not done in real time then I would simply record it<br/>as a waveform and then speed it up by a factor of about 50 to 100 to<br/>move the 0.5-40 Hz frequencies into the 25-2000 or 50-4000 Hz range that<br/>humans can hear well.  This would pretty interesting I think, and I<br/>would love to receive any WAV files of brain recordings.</p><p>If it is to be done in real time then I would still try to go for a 50<br/>to 100 speed up by simply moving all the frequencies up by that factor<br/>but in this case the piece would last 50 to 100 times longer.  There are<br/>several ways to do this, but using FFT to make a spectrum and then<br/>generating a waveform to play from the adjusted frequencies is the most<br/>accurate.</p><p>I have been doing vipassana meditation for about a year and I think that<br/>I could now have some measure of control over what frequencies I make<br/>and maybe make single tones with a little bit of practice and would love<br/>to get involved in such a project.
