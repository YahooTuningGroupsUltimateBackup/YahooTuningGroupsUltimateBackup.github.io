The FIRST SENTENCE of the article on the kleisma now goes &quot;In music theory, the kleisma is an interval important to temperaments of the Bohlen-Pierce scale.&quot; Excuse me, but didn&apos;t I see a 2 in the factorization of the kleisma? Why yes--in fact, more than one 2! WHY is this the first sentence, or even any sentence in the entire article? Unless I hear an objection and until some BP fanboy reverts, which seems all too likely, I propose removing it.</p><p>I also object to 27/25 being referred to as a Bohlen-Pierce interval simply because it is the ratio of two odd numbers. BP already has dibs on 245/243 and 3125/3087, how much more does it need? The problem is, the interval already has at least three other more traditional names: the large limma, the semitone maximus and the just minor second. Stop the BP madness before it engulfs us all!</p></div><h3><a id=89262 href="#89262">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2010 9:11:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;I also object to 27/25 being referred to as a Bohlen-Pierce interval simply because it is the ratio of two odd numbers.&quot;</p><p>And if you look at...<br/>   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohlen%E2%80%93Pierce_scale">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohlen%E2%80%93Pierce_scale</a><br/>...that 27/25 ratio is not even a direct part of the BP diatonic scale, only a difference between two of the dyads in it.  And, it&apos;s certainly not a direct factors of 3,5,7...the so-called main factors in BP...it seems to me an unintended side-effect ratio of BP rather than a direct part of its construction.</p><p>  Furthermore I&apos;ve tried BP myself and don&apos;t consider it an ideal scale for odd-harmonic focused timbres.  Really!<br/>   BP is described on Wikipedia as a product of 3:5:7 and 5:7:9 chords...but a whole bunch of about minor third or larger ratios formed from different dyads within the BP diatonic scale such as 7/5 over 25/21 = about 20/17 (where 17 is not 3,5,7, or 9!)<br/>  I don&apos;t know if anyone has tried this, but making a scale based on the factors of 3, 5, 7, 9, AND 11 seems like a much more realistic idea so most dyads have odd-numbered relationships.  Trying to make all relationships in a  scale fit 3,5,7 or 5:7:9 to me seems a recipe to make virtually everything that doesn&apos;t fit into triads sound very un-confident.   That&apos;s also the same impression I got when composing (or trying to compose?!) with BP.<br/>  The world shalt not only revolve around purifying odd-harmonic-based triads?!...it would really be nice if we had a BP-like scale that focused on other types of chords as well rather than purifying triads and then saying &quot;whatever else happens...happens&quot;.</p></div>
