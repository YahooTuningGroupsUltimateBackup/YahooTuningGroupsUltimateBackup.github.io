The first one is 5:7:9, the<br/>second one is a 5:7:9 stretched so that the frequency difference<br/>between the two is even, and the last is 1/1 17/12 20/11, which is<br/>actually periodic but produces buzz that&apos;s less clear. Also check the<br/>examples here</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95699">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95699</a></p><p>All of the &quot;mystery&quot; examples, as well as the &quot;alt&quot; examples, are<br/>linearly stretched and not actually periodic. If you alter the linear<br/>spacing as Michael tried to do by actually rationalizing it, but in<br/>such a way that for a:b:c b-a != k*(c-b), you&apos;ll get this warbly buzz.<br/>The buzz is also phase-sensitive and for any chord, the buzz can be<br/>attenuated by screwing with the phase of the notes. Examples are<br/>provided of this as well. Gammatone filter plots are also provided and<br/>predict this behavior, which means there&apos;s a good bet that it&apos;s<br/>happening in the cochlea.</p><p>Assuming the hypothesis of cochlear origin is correct, then the reason<br/>impulse trains sound different is that they contain partials of equal<br/>volume up till infinity. So while periodicity buzz in this model is<br/>the sound of AM between the constituent tones, for an impulse train<br/>you reach the point where the higher partials get so close together<br/>that they just sound completely unpitched, and you get a periodic,<br/>recurring, high-passed &quot;thwack&quot; sound on top of the buzz. So if the<br/>perceptual quality of buzz is that the notes have some AM on them (or<br/>the timbral quality of the fused tone fluctuates a bit, which would be<br/>the same thing), then an impulse train will contain this plus an<br/>unpitched recurring thwack sound on top of it, which is not what you&apos;d<br/>normally call buzz.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, May 5, 2011 at 9:27 AM, Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t really followed closely the discussion about periodicity<br/>&gt; buzz, sorry about that.

If in the past I&apos;ve ever<br/>simplified the true nature of what&apos;s going on in the brain, as with my<br/>&quot;filterbank of comb filters&quot; idea, it&apos;s only because I&apos;m trying to see<br/>if the simplified model might work well enough to be usable in<br/>practice, because the kind of nonlinear dynamics that are involved in<br/>the real brain use math that&apos;s extraordinarily complicated. This isn&apos;t<br/>a claim that there really is a true, perfectly linear signal chain all<br/>along the length of the auditory system, but just that the results<br/>from simplifications like that might be good enough for government<br/>work anyway. I&apos;m not sure when I&apos;ve ever proposed such a<br/>simplification outside of the filterbank idea so you&apos;ll have to remind<br/>me if I have.</p><p>But what you have said above is the argument that I&apos;m using against<br/>your suggestion that periodicity buzz is caused by an algorithm in the<br/>brain, and one that would require the perfect reconstruction of the<br/>time-domain waveform. I see no evidence for that, and lots of evidence<br/>that the opposite is instead true. The fact that the original time<br/>domain waveform is spiky could very well have profound impacts all<br/>across the length of the signal chain, but to state that the brain<br/>puts it all back together and then has a second algorithm to<br/>re-process it, and that this second algorithm leads to buzz, seems<br/>rather unlikely. While I won&apos;t say it&apos;s impossible, as biological<br/>feats of nature are quite common, I will say it&apos;s not worth assuming<br/>unless there&apos;s some reason to assume it.</p><p>Actually, this discussion might not be necessary, as the example below<br/>demonstrates very clearly an example of where more spikiness != more<br/>buzz.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Right, and I&apos;m saying I agree.

It means generally decreasing buzz loudness<br/>with interval width. As you&apos;ve stated, the cochlea is a compressor,<br/>the full details of which are continually emerging, so we have no idea<br/>how rapid the effective perceptual decline should be. The cochlear<br/>amplifier is certainly going to be interacting with things in ways<br/>that I have no idea how to predict. However, the gammatone toolbox has<br/>predicted that even the 7/5 you first requested at 750 Hz will have<br/>weak buzz between the two tones, so it&apos;s decent enough for now.</p><p>Either way, the important thing is that this model does predict that<br/>there will be a decline with increasing distance, which the<br/>&quot;spikiness&quot; model doesn&apos;t predict.

What exactly do you mean by &quot;traditional,&quot;<br/>and what are the usual frequency-domain methods that you think are<br/>falling short? I also don&apos;t know if I&apos;d treat human hearing as a<br/>filter, I&apos;d treat it as a feature space with some feature extraction<br/>stuff going on, most of which does not involve the exact preservation<br/>of the original time domain waveform in any sense. I guess the two are<br/>equivalent if you really want to nitpick.</p><p>&gt; &gt; to state that the brain puts it all back together and then<br/>&gt; &gt; has a second algorithm to re-process it ... seems rather<br/>&gt; &gt; unlikely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not unlikely because it&apos;s a known fact. It&apos;s how pitch<br/>&gt; works of course, and almost all the types of scene analysis<br/>&gt; that make up hearing.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it is a known fact that the brain takes the ridiculously<br/>processed input that&apos;s coming out of the cochlea and brain stem and so<br/>on, and then reconstructs the time-domain signal exactly.

If you have evidence that the brain actually reconstructs the<br/>waveform, then I&apos;ll gladly change my tune.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Either way, the important thing is that this model does predict<br/>&gt; &gt; that there will be a decline with increasing distance, which<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;spikiness&quot; model doesn&apos;t predict. For example:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzrolloffcomparison.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzrolloffcomparison.png</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzrollofftest.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzrollofftest.wav</a><br/>&gt; &gt; These are all with cosines, which should lead to optimal<br/>&gt; &gt; spikiness. Note that 2/1 is the spikiest, but it is in no way<br/>&gt; &gt; buzzier than 7/6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is 2/1 spikiest? Of course I haven&apos;t supplied a definition<br/>&gt; of spiky, so that&apos;s on me. I hear buzz only on 7/6 and 7/5,<br/>&gt; and on 7/5 only weakly (or maybe rapidly).<br/>//snip<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or is it that the buzz is too rapid for 1:2:3?</p><p>I was going by, I guess, some intuitive combination of the standard<br/>deviation and mean of amplitude with respect to time.

Think about the<br/>&gt; time-domain response of the hairs in the ear to the incoming<br/>&gt; waveforms, and how the spikes might cause synchronized AM vs<br/>&gt; asynchronous AM if the spikes weren&apos;t periodic.</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The first two to me sound like they have even buzz, and the last one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sounds like it has chorusy, warbly buzz. The first one is 5:7:9, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; second one is a 5:7:9 stretched so that the frequency difference<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; between the two is even, and the last is 1/1 17/12 20/11, which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; actually periodic but produces buzz that&apos;s less clear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These don&apos;t sound at all like periodicity buzz to me. Listen to this:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/haircut/haircutlattices.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/haircut/haircutlattices.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The high-limit otonalities have that sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, so far, everyone has said they&apos;ve heard buzz on the example I<br/>&gt; provided. Carl made the additional note that although there was some<br/>&gt; kind of chorus in the last example, it didn&apos;t destroy the buzz. So<br/>&gt; perhaps what you&apos;re calling periodicity buzz is a different phenomenon<br/>&gt; than we&apos;ve been hearing.</p><p>Or it could just be that I personally hear it only at lower<br/>frequencies (meaning the frequency of the buzz/envelope spikes).</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure exactly what phenomenon you&apos;re describing as buzz, but<br/>&gt; these chords are ridiculously awesome! Joe Monz wrote this? Is he a<br/>&gt; jazz musician? How the hell did I miss this guy being around?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But yeah, over the otonalities I hear some kind of rhythmic amplitude<br/>&gt; fluctuation, same as I do over the examples I posted, just more<br/>&gt; intense, since there are more notes and harmonic timbres involved.</p><p>Paul described it as periodicity buzz at the time:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/1788">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/1788</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also check the examples here<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95699">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/95699</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These have that sound, even the 5:6:7 has some of it because it is<br/>&gt; &gt; lower now. I also hear a strong infrapitch sensation with the<br/>&gt; &gt; mystery phi example. Periodicity seems to be a good description<br/>&gt; &gt; what it phenomenally sounds like, as if something is repeating.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t care if the waveform is really periodic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;infrapitch?&quot; But maybe it just has to do with the<br/>&gt; varying individual response of the auditory filter that you didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; hear it with the 5:7:9 above. Either way, you didn&apos;t seem to even hear<br/>&gt; it with the truly periodic 5:7:9, but note that we all hear it more as<br/>&gt; the signal gets closer.</p><p>Infrapitch is &quot;the perception of acoustic iterance&quot;, I read that<br/>somewhere. :)<br/>Not quite rhythm and not quite pitch but something between.

Needless to say, I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; endorsing their algorithm.</p><p>It worked for this particular case, e.g. where they gradually increase<br/>the inharmonicity of the waveform and average the two waveforms<br/>together. If I understand it correctly, the model would break down in<br/>the case I presented above. The reason is that they did to the<br/>waveform what you accused me of doing, which is performing an<br/>oversimplified frequency domain analysis on the filtered signal. It<br/>looks like the cochlea generates a transient spike at either every<br/>zero-crossing or every instance in which the vibrating hair turns<br/>around (same difference), and that this spike&apos;s amplitude is in some<br/>sense proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation. Thus, if the<br/>hair&apos;s oscillation is undergoing some kind of amplitude modulation,<br/>the spikes will have AM in the same shape as the envelope itself. For<br/>them to just take the entire signal and put it in the frequency domain<br/>will definitely stick the envelope frequency in there as a component<br/>tone, where normally it doesn&apos;t for just a sine with AM on it, because<br/>this whole &quot;spikes&quot; concept is a ridiculously severe nonlinearity<br/>that&apos;s going to make stuff like that happen. So that&apos;s expected.</p><p>But what they did is just take the Fourier transform of the whole<br/>thing and then do some sketchy math to estimate the resultant virtual<br/>pitch. Their model wasn&apos;t an attempt to be an accurate neurological<br/>model, but rather a simple metric for pitch estimation that,<br/>unfortunately, looks like it&apos;ll break down for cases like the one I<br/>mentioned (unless I am really misunderstanding something). Their<br/>oversimplified pure-frequency domain analysis doesn&apos;t comment on the<br/>time-frequency spread of the resulting waveform, hence it doesn&apos;t say<br/>anything at all about how or where buzz could occur, which requires a<br/>frequency to fluctuate in volume over time.</p><p>If they instead use a short-time Fourier transform with a windowing<br/>function, then that gives us a second filterbank-like structure where<br/>buzz could occur, and it would also suggest a second place for another<br/>critical band to exist. I&apos;ve seen a double critical band hypothesis<br/>proposed in the literature, but I honestly don&apos;t know much about it. I<br/>am willing to accept that buzz could be generated at a second spectral<br/>filtering stage like that, but I didn&apos;t want to buy into this double<br/>critical band theory without seeing some proof of it, so I said it was<br/>cochlear in origin. Maybe an exploration of the cochlear model of buzz<br/>will lead to a prediction that experiment violates, and then ends up<br/>providing more proof of the double critical band hypothesis that way.<br/>Or maybe people already believe it, I dunno, like I said, I&apos;m not up<br/>to date on this concept. All I know is that it would entail that all<br/>of our roughness experiments have been measuring the effects of two<br/>critical bands and attributing their combined interaction solely to<br/>the cochlea, so I&apos;m not sure what kind of radical reinterpretation<br/>that would require of the existing literature.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why the 100 Hz limit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 10ms is really short to hear any kind of envelope changes, no?</p><p>I guess so, but the reason that I believe is the case is because once<br/>the spikes get close enough together, they also start to signal tones<br/>that are far enough apart to be well-resolved by the cochlea. If we&apos;re<br/>taking the cochlea out of this process, where does the limitation come<br/>from?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2011 3:06:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;Difference tones&quot; usually means tones are heard,<br/>&gt; &gt; not envelope.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re saying that the envelope is in some sense &quot;heard&quot;<br/>&gt; as a pitch,</p><p>I&apos;m saying it&apos;s heard as an envelope.
