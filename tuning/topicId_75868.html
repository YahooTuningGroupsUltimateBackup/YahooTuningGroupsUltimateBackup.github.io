(Which is how the temperament system got its name.) It was someone on the tuning list (I believe it was Paul Erlich) who observed that the porcupine chord progression also works in 22-ET.</p><p>However, I do have MIDI files of the final chord progression in various porcupine ET&apos;s including 22 on my web page.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a></p><p>There&apos;s also a continually rising 12-ET version which demonstrates that 12-ET is not a porcupine temperament.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2008 8:52:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>//<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I do have MIDI files of the final chord progression in<br/>&gt; various porcupine ET&apos;s including 22 on my web page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s also a continually rising 12-ET version which<br/>&gt; demonstrates that 12-ET is not a porcupine temperament.</p><p>I took the opportunity to revisit this page.
