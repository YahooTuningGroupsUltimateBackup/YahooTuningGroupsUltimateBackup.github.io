When the ship&apos;s<br/>sonar detects an incoming torpedo, the transducers simultaneously<br/>fire an acoustic shock wave of such intensity that the torpedo either<br/>detonates early or is disabled by the pulse&apos;s crushing force,<br/>according to the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),<br/>which is funding the project.</p><p>But these are no ordinary loudspeakers: instead of having a<br/>membranous diaphragm that can vibrate in response to a range of audio<br/>frequencies, each of the devices has a ram-like cylindrical metal<br/>armature at its centre. This is projected outwards by electromagnets<br/>at very high speed, producing a shock wave. The array can be fired as<br/>many times as needed.</p><p>When the six rows of 60 transducers on each side of the ship fire at<br/>once, the cumulative action should generate a &quot;destructive pressure<br/>pulse capable of disabling an enemy&apos;s torpedo&quot;, according to DARPA.</p><p>Exactly how the system works is shrouded in military secrecy. But by<br/>making a speaker several times larger than the wavelength of the<br/>sound wave required, a tightly focused beam can be produced in frontof the speaker. This is because beam width is partly determined by<br/>the aperture of the source - a bigger loudspeaker focuses sound in a<br/>smaller area. (New Scientist, 9 September 2000, p 38). And the<br/>combined size of the array makes for a very large speaker indeed.<br/>This focusing would allow the array to precisely target incoming<br/>torpedoes. In addition, the beam can be steered in different<br/>directions - probably by slightly altering the phase of the applied<br/>signals - a technique that is widely used to steer radio waves using<br/>side-by-side antennas. So torpedoes homing in on the ship&apos;s wake from<br/>many directions can be targeted (see Diagram).</p><p>So far, the system&apos;s developers, Anteon Technologies of Fairfax,<br/>Virginia, and BAE Systems of Farnborough, UK, have only built one<br/>transducer. But encouraged by software simulations that show the<br/>array should work, they plan to press ahead with a one-quarter-scale<br/>test rig.</p><p>If it reaches the stage of testing in the open ocean, however, the<br/>developers are likely to come into conflict with marine biologists.<br/>They have evidence that whales blasted by frequent acoustic signals<br/>from submarine or ship sonar appear to develop symptoms of<br/>decompression sickness, and die. (New Scientist, 11 October 2003, p 10).<br/>&ldquo;The torpedo detonates early or is disabled by the pulse&apos;s crushing<br/>force&rdquo;</p><p>But neither DARPA, Anteon, nor BAE Systems was willing to respond to<br/>questions about the array&apos;s proposed energy levels and any threat to<br/>marine mammals they might pose.<br/>From issue 2520 of New Scientist magazine, 06 October 2005, page 32<br/>Printable version Email to a friend RSS Feed</p></div>
