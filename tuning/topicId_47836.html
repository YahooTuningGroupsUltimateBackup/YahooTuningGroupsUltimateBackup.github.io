Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 ,<br/>USA<br/>(Dated: Submitted to Phys. Rev. D. July 15 2003, revised Oct. 9 2003 - still no<br/>referee report.)<br/>We investigate anomalies reported in the Cosmic Microwave Background maps from<br/>the Wilkinson<br/>Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite on very large angular scales and<br/>discuss possible<br/>interpretations. Three independent anomalies involve the quadrupole and<br/>octopole: 1) The cosmic<br/>quadrupole on its own is anomalous at the 1-in-20 level by being low (the<br/>cut-sky quadrupole measured<br/>by the WMAP team is more strikingly low, apparently due to a coincidence in the<br/>orientation<br/>of our Galaxy of no cosmological significance); 2) The cosmic octopole on its<br/>own is anomalous at<br/>the 1-in-20 level by being very planar; 3) The alignment between the quadrupole<br/>and octopole is<br/>anomalous at the 1-in-60 level. Although the a priori chance of all three<br/>occurring is 1 in 24000, the<br/>multitude of alternative anomalies one could have looked for dilutes the<br/>significance of such a pos-<br/>teriori statistics. The simplest small universe model where the universe has<br/>toroidal topology with<br/>one small dimension of order half the horizon scale, in the direction towards<br/>Virgo, could explain<br/>the three items above. However, we rule this model out using two topological<br/>tests: the S-statistic<br/>and the matched circle test. In particular, our results rule out the recently<br/>proposed dodecahedron<br/>model of Luminet, Weeks, Riazuelo, Lehoucq &amp; Uzan</p></div>
