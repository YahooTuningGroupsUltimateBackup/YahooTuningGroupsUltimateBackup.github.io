But it&apos;s pretty much ignored; if we could pin down better why some scales are ignored like this it might be illuminating. One thing to note right off the bat is that it isn&apos;t proper. Another is that the gap between the widest step size of 5/4 and the smallest of 16/15 is pretty wide. Still another is that all the step sizes are different--five notes, five different sizes of steps between those notes; moreover mean variety is high. Does anyone think the scale, even so, could be used to make decent music in? Has anyone ever tried, I wonder?</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2011 2:36:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1-9/8-5/4-3/2-15/8-2</p><p>What about this?<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n_ZayUW5cc">www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n_ZayUW5cc</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2011 7:50:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1-9/8-5/4-3/2-15/8-2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about this?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n_ZayUW5cc">www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n_ZayUW5cc</a></p><p>Hmmm...Hamsadhvani is the word, I guess.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2011 8:56:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;1-9/8-5/4-3/2-15/8-2&quot;</p><p>   My biggest gripe about that scale is not actually the lack of being &quot;strictly proper&quot;, though, of course, that matters so far as easy composition...but the lack of tonal color.</p><p>   That scale is really just&nbsp; 8/8 9/8 10/8 12/8 15/8 16/8...8:9:10:12:15:16.&nbsp; There is a huge lack of expressiveness, IMVHO, when you can&apos;t switch to the feeling of different root tones.&nbsp; Everything is just x/8, x/4, and x/2...where x/4 and x/2 are just subsets of x/8.</p><p>   Something like the following scale, giving the following harmonic series segments, would give a good deal more tonal color...</p><p>1, 9/8, 6/5, 3/2, 5/3  (x/15, x/10, x/8, x/24, x/3, x/6)<br/>1, 9/8, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3  (x/8, x/24, x/3, x/6)<br/>1, 9/8, 4/3, 3/2, 9/5  (x/15, x/10, x/24, x/3, x/6)<br/>1, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 9/5  (x/15, x/10, x/6, x/3)</p><p>  This also explains why I, in general, gravitate heavily against composing with straight harmonic series scales with very low numbered fractions...they look great on paper, but feel very emotionally flat to me when actually composed with.  I actually made an x/16 scale (16th harmonic) as one of my first scales, which Carl complained was &quot;just the 16th harmonic&quot; and Kraig replied &quot;it&apos;s still original...because it&apos;s only a subset&quot;.  I loved the way the numbers worked...but it feel apart when I tried composing with it.  Anything that fits higher up in the series... particularly x/18 and x/24 (18th and 24 harmonic) seem to do much better as they have many more factors (including 2,3,6,and 9 for 18 and 2,3,4,6,8,and 12 for 24).</p><p>  Also, to note, JI Diatonic is essentially a 24th harmonic based scale...which, IMVHO, is no coincidence.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2011 10:49:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;1-9/8-5/4-3/2-15/8-2&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    My biggest gripe about that scale is not actually the lack of being &quot;strictly proper&quot;, though, of course, that matters so far as easy composition...but the lack of tonal color.</p><p>Here&apos;s a similar scale.
