As many of<br/>you are aware, my earlier efforts were done by plotting the lattice<br/>rather slavishly through common-tone harmonies.</p><p>Now, however, I&apos;m trying to do this procedure more by ear, which is<br/>how it should have been done in the first place!  I notice, though,<br/>that after my exposure to Blackjack harmonies I actually am using<br/>common tone progressions, but the common tones are sometimes implied<br/>and I use a greater variety of dissonant chords to contrast the<br/>consonances.</p><p>I made a scan of the opening chords to my new woodwind quintet as an<br/>illustration.  I hope this comes up as nicely in your browser as it<br/>does in mine.  It works perfectly.  Good luck!</p><p>It&apos;s here in the &quot;files&quot; section and is called chordsdemo.jpg:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Pehrson/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Pehrson/</a></p><p>Anyway, as you will see, the very first chord (from the bass) C&lt;:F&lt;:A<br/>is an interesting dissonance with a 4:3 between the bottom notes and<br/>an A which appears to be connected by a 7:6 (Paul or somebody, please<br/>correct me if I&apos;m wrong here)</p><p>So, this is a chord that is part of a &quot;parallelogram&quot;  (thank you,<br/>Paul) that consists of F&lt;:C&lt;:D:A.  This is a &quot;seventhy&quot; kind of<br/>parallelogram that, essentially connects two of the basic &quot;just&quot;<br/>tetrads.</p><p>Now, notice that the next chord substitutes a D for the F&lt; in the<br/>first chord making the &quot;regular&quot; triad:  A:D:F#v.  That becomes<br/>a &quot;resolution&quot; of sorts.</p><p>Continuing on, rather than slavishly following the lattice, similar<br/>substitutions take place as the D again RETURNS to an F&lt;.</p><p>This F&lt; becomes the 5:4 pitch of a triad C#v:F&lt;:G#v.  So, essentially<br/>that alternation of  pitches becomes a kind of &quot;unifying factor&quot;<br/>without any slavish plotting.</p><p>And to continue to the fourth chord, note that the F&lt; is maintained.<br/>It becomes the root of a chord F&lt;:Bb^:D.  This is an interesting<br/>chord because we have used the F&lt; and the D so much before.  The F&lt;<br/>and the Bb^ of this chord, if I am correct, are the far borders of<br/>the hexany F&lt;:C#v:G:Bb^:D:G#v yes?  And, I believe F&lt;:Bb^ outline a<br/>ratio of 11 here.  (Please correct me here if I am wrong).</p><p>Anyway, this chord is a quasi-dissonance on the utonal side, yes?  It<br/>resolves to E&gt;:A&gt;:Db^.   Now, what makes this such a finalized<br/>resolution to the ear?  Quite frankly, I don&apos;t know:</p><p>This &quot;resolution&quot; is a little more tenacious, theoretically. From the<br/>Bb^ to the E&gt; is a 7:5, yes?  (one of the cyan lines) and I&apos;m<br/>figuring there is an implied G making the transition between the<br/>hexany and the tetrad that is part of the triad A&gt;:E&gt;: Db^.</p><p>Now maybe that theoretical logic is specious.  However, the aural<br/>result is clear, and there is definitely a strong resolution on the<br/>final triad of this sequence.</p><p>I put an mp3 up of this sequence in the Tuning List Files forum.  The<br/>file is called, obviously, chordprogression.mp3:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/Pehrson/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files/files/Pehrson/</a></p><p>If anybody has any other ideas as to why this resolution works so<br/>well (if in fact somebody feels it does, I am more than open to<br/>suggestion)</p><p>I think it has something to do with an implied G and a motion down to<br/>a tetrad a fifth below the prominent D (It&apos;s been prominent<br/>throughout this progression).</p><p>Possibly??</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2003 1:07:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; illustration.

Did you know that, if<br/>one writes out the Blackjack notes, it really is possible to do<br/>pretty &quot;accurate&quot; analysis in 12-equal??  This sounds like sacrilege,<br/>but it really is possible.  The deviations from 12-equal are really<br/>small enough so that one still gets an overall aural picture related<br/>to our &quot;old&quot; system.</p><p>Anyway, what we&apos;re hearing here in the last two chords is a<br/>progression using the NEAPOLITAN... or a lowered ii chord.
