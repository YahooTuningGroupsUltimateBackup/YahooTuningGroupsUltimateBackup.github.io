It&apos;s not a meantone temperament, even in the most<br/>inclusive sense of that word.</p><p>&gt;At 22-tet, the<br/>&gt;whole-tone has grown to ~218.18 cents and the diatonic semitone has<br/>&gt;contracted to ~54.54 cents, with R at 4. While this semitone --<br/>&gt;literally a &quot;diatonic quartertone&quot; -- may look very small on paper, I<br/>&gt;find that my ears can routinely accept it as a regular semitone.</p><p>One of the pieces I performed at the Microthon was a modal improv, where one<br/>of the modes used was the neo-gothic aeolian mode of 22-tET. Characterized<br/>by tonic, subdominant, and dominant triads all tuned approximately 6:7:9,<br/>whole tones of 218.18 cents, and diatonic semitones of 54.54 cents, this<br/>mode doesn&apos;t sound &quot;microtonal&quot; to most people -- it sounds comfortable and<br/>familiar. Only in attempting to use one of the major triads of the mode do<br/>we elicit reactions of unfamiliarity from most people.</p><p>&gt;to tune 22-tet for Neo-Gothic music is likely more an<br/>&gt;expression of calculated xenharmonic zest.</p><p>Or perhaps someone might have a desire to use acoustically recognizable<br/>intervals (6:7, 9:7, etc.) as the functional discords -- one could imagine<br/>an &quot;adaptive JI&quot; version of a neo-gothic piece where subtle deviations from<br/>22-tET allow all vertical intervals to be in JI, and 7-based ratios instead<br/>of 5-based ratios become the target tunings for thirds and sixths.</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We have moved!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
