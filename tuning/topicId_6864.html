It<br/>is a crucial musical issue and almost deserves it&apos;s own Internet list!!<br/>I&apos;ve been amazed at some of the posts going back to the Margo Schulter<br/>comments on the Renaissance.</p><p>However, perhaps I have been missing something.  Has there been any comment<br/>of late on the Johnny Reinhard/Dean Drummond, Danlee Mitchell controversy<br/>concerning Partch performances??</p><p>As I&apos;m certain many of you are aware, there is this extreme example of<br/>Partch and his &quot;designated curators&quot; not wanting his music performed on<br/>instruments other than the originals, and Johnny Reinhard&apos;s performances<br/>using synthesizer to replace certain instruments (was it the chromelodeon<br/>-- I can&apos;t remember?...)</p><p>In any case, in one instance you have the &quot;practicality&quot; of getting the<br/>music out to a wider public,  (I guess the Kronos quartet Partch is another<br/>example that got excoriated) as opposed to the true &quot;intent&quot; of the<br/>composer -- which in Partch&apos;s case was certainly very clear... (and<br/>extreme)</p><p>My question is how this fits into &quot;contemporary&quot; performance practice.<br/>What IS our performance practice today?  If we look back into history, as<br/>Schulter has, and we find particular tunings for any given time, what is<br/>our practice today??  Are we basically 12-tET, meaning that ANYTHING<br/>including Partch can be slammed into that framework (as one listee recently<br/>suggested)... or does our modern period really have MANY different<br/>concurrent tunings.  [Or are we dreaming, and alternate tunings are really<br/>only that -- experimental and &quot;alternate??&quot;]</p><p>And what do we do about Bach, Machaut and others?...  If we are to proceed<br/>according to M. Schulter we will be taking the Harry Partch approach.  If<br/>we don&apos;t use the original instruments and tunings we shouldn&apos;t be<br/>performing the music at all...  There certainly would be a lot fewer<br/>performances of these composers this way....</p><p>It is imazing to me how these practices cut across all time and space --<br/>Partch, Machaut and Bach all in the same bed, so to speak.  (Ahem...)</p><p>Please illuminate...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
