I want to raise it.<br/>&gt;&gt;(Call it &quot;cultural conditioning&quot; if you want to, but it certainly is not<br/>&gt;&gt;conditioning for the novice singers in my college choir who have heard<br/>&gt;&gt;tempered thirds all their lives.)</p><p>To which Paul Erlich inquired:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How does that argument run?</p><p>Simply that I know of no reason why novice singers should &quot;prefer&quot; anything<br/>other than what they have heard all of their lives--namely tempered thirds.<br/>Nevertheless, after learning how to tune (in the general sense of seeking<br/>peaceful intervals), they appear to prefer a tuning lower than the tempered<br/>third when singing a simple interval and then move to a tuning higher than<br/>the tempered third when the fifth is sounding. As far as I can see, there<br/>has been no conditioning toward either of these &quot;preferences&quot; other than a<br/>recently learned sensitivity to aural tuning.</p><p>As you know, I am not &quot;arguing&quot; for any preconceived conclusion.
