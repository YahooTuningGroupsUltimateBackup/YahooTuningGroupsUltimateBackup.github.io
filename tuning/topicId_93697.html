Here, positive and negative peaks are marked with a point along a display period of 0.1 seconds. The peak wave shape and any  section of the plot presents a cyclical and aesthetic distribution along the time; these features make possible the recognition of  JI -Cmaj as an optimal triad. Please note that for reaching to this conclusion I only needed to work with pure sinusoids, that is, free of overtones and the absence of timbre since a chord still is a chord with or without the timbre.</p><p>- Plot B:  Cmaj chord wave peaks. Each point mark  of plot A  is transferred to plot  B and the display period is increased to 2 seconds to enable the visualization of  the triad sound. In the plot we only see the point marks of plot  A shown in twelve rows. The plot appearance is extremely simple and the symmetry of rows is evident. This was all I needed to conclude that JI - Cmaj  triad is an optimal chord; the same for JI - Fmaj  and JI - Bmaj.</p><p>About JI - Dmaj, the plot method of evaluation will detect that it is an out of tune triad since (1.66666./1.125) = 1.48148148. instead of 1.5.</p><p>I know that you are acquainted with all these details, I would like to plot this out of tune triad to see how it looks and send it to you.</p><p>3) Despite the timbre gives color to the chord, in my opinion we should separate its applications: music and chord measurements.</p><p>You wrote &quot;To establish validity, one would have to plot a variety of chords, each in a variety of timbres.&quot;</p><p>4) Since the evaluation rely on the combined wave shape to be examined along seconds, pure sine waves had to be used.</p><p>Should you want to evaluate a triad by this method, just send it to me to process it  and see how it looks as well as to get your final opinion on this matter which will be respected.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario</p><p>__________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 5536 (20101016) __________</p><p>ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p><a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=93701 href="#93701">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2010 1:39:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mario,</p><p>&gt; Please note that for reaching to this conclusion I only needed<br/>&gt; to work with pure sinusoids, that is, free of overtones and the<br/>&gt; absence of timbre since a chord still is a chord with or without<br/>&gt; the timbre.</p><p>If the things you observe on the plots go away or change when<br/>a different timbre is used, I would say that invalidates the<br/>analysis.</p><p>&gt; This was all I needed to conclude that JI - Cmaj  triad is<br/>&gt; an optimal chord; the same for JI - Fmaj  and JI - Bmaj.</p><p>If you used the usual JI diatonic scale,</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1</p><p>with 1/1 = C, then Cmaj and Fmaj are the same chord.

Our viewpoints entered to the area of pure reasoning I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the things you observe on the plots go away or change when<br/>&gt; a different timbre is used, I would say that invalidates the<br/>&gt; analysis.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt; If it is introduced any intensity of &quot;oversounds&quot;on a sinusoidal sound &gt;&gt; wave we get &gt;&gt; a slightly irregular mixed tone wave (not necessarily a &gt;&gt; musical tone or a chord) &gt;&gt; A tone with timbre would have been made and a &gt;&gt; distorted sound wave too. The &gt;&gt; soundwave analyzer duty is to plot the &gt;&gt; sound wave current to evaluate how pure &gt;&gt; is the sound. The oversounds &gt;&gt; used to get the timbre caused abnormal plots. &gt;&gt;Since the purpose is the &gt;&gt; production of normal combined sound waves, &gt;&gt;oversounds shouldn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t be &gt;&gt; used. (Sorry for the imagination)</p><p>&gt;&gt;When a student is using the Fourier analysis, the job is going well &gt;&gt;provided the &gt;&gt;input function is not a very complex expression like the &gt;&gt;branches of a tree. &gt;&gt;Similarly, if a triad is going to be analyzed, the &gt;&gt;analyzer input must only contain &gt;&gt;figures that represent the pure tone &gt;&gt;frequencies without the timbre.</p><p>Carl,<br/>Tomorrow I will continue with your last three paragraphs</p><p>Regards</p><p>Mario<br/>October 17</p><p>----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, October 17, 2010 3:39 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Complementary information</p><p>&gt; Hi Mario,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Please note that for reaching to this conclusion I only needed<br/>&gt;&gt; to work with pure sinusoids, that is, free of overtones and the<br/>&gt;&gt; absence of timbre since a chord still is a chord with or without<br/>&gt;&gt; the timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the things you observe on the plots go away or change when<br/>&gt; a different timbre is used, I would say that invalidates the<br/>&gt; analysis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This was all I needed to conclude that JI - Cmaj  triad is<br/>&gt;&gt; an optimal chord; the same for JI - Fmaj  and JI - Bmaj.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you used the usual JI diatonic scale,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with 1/1 = C, then Cmaj and Fmaj are the same chord.

The triad tones and the &gt;&gt;timbre print on the chord wave plot &gt;&gt; their combined sinusoidal waves. &gt;&gt;The plot shows the result of the combined sinusoidal &gt;&gt; triad tones mixed &gt;&gt;with variables that nothing have to do with music; however they         &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;improve the musical expression.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You have the plot Cmaj - JI - 0.1 sec of display that I sent you &gt;&gt; yesterday; this            &gt;&gt; response does not include timbre, &gt;&gt; nevertheless the plot appearance asserts that the &gt;&gt; triad is a tuned &gt;&gt; one. If the timbre would have been included , some degree of &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; distortion would have appeared. If you agree, I can make a plot with &gt;&gt; the same triad plus &gt;&gt; the timbre represented by 3% amplitude, 2nd and 3d &gt;&gt; harmonics to reach a conclusion.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Since Cmaj - JI - 0.1 sec plot shows a periodic [(0.045 - 0.03) = 0.015 &gt;&gt; sec]  and      &gt;&gt; aesthetic display, so the triad is a tuned triad; in &gt;&gt; this case it is not  necessary to transfer &gt;&gt; the peak marks to a second &gt;&gt; plot called  &quot;chord wave peaks&quot;. However I made this plot &gt;&gt; and sent it &gt;&gt; to you, its display period is 2 seconds, and contains 12 rows of peak &gt;&gt; marks.</p><p>&gt;&gt; When the triad comes from a 12 tone scale the number of peak marks &gt;&gt; increases       &gt;&gt; considerably and the plotted wave shape may be &gt;&gt; periodic and aesthetic, somewhat   &gt;&gt; aesthetic, or chaotic.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Should the triad tones carry overtones the timbre is part of the process, &gt;&gt; each overtone &gt;&gt; origins its peak marks, introducing some amount of &gt;&gt; distortion on the plot.</p><p>&gt; Also important is the plotting method used -- for instance,<br/>&gt; the sample rate.  It&apos;s a lot of work to show something about<br/>&gt; chord quality visually and in fact of the many attempts I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; seen over the years, none were successful.

The result coincided with your &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; opinion: A group of small and thin peaks appeared in the plot. The &gt;&gt; remaining plots      &gt;&gt; looked free of peaks. The D triad sound when put &gt;&gt; on the oscilloscope looked normal.</p><p>&gt; 4) Since the evaluation rely on the combined wave shape to<br/>&gt; be examined along seconds, pure sine waves had to be used.<br/>&gt;&gt; Sorry, I forgot to complete the idea.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand this, but at any rate, it is essential<br/>&gt; to show your method is relevant to timbres typically used<br/>&gt; in music-making (sine tones are not!).
