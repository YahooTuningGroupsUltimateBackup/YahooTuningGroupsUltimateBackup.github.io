All the composers you quote are American microtonalists<br/>who use JI.  But there are plenty of microtonalists as famous or more famous<br/>in the world that use temperament, or even noise.

However, since I ALSO use a myriad of<br/>other tunings, JI composers do not recognize this fact.

The same is not true of subharmonics (Partch&apos;s<br/>&quot;utonal&quot; chords), which rapidly become dissonant as you go<br/>up the series.  However, the ratios required to spell extended<br/>utonal chords also become more complex very quickly, and<br/>usually &quot;JI&quot; entails something about ratios being simple.<br/>Complex ratios are also needed to make small intervals that<br/>would have strong critical band interactions.  So JI does<br/>indeed seem to guarantee sensory consonance for chords.<br/>And by using Tenney Height (numerator * denominator of a<br/>ratio in lowest terms, or, by extension, a * b * c... of the<br/>notes in a chord, where a, b, and c are coprime integers over<br/>a common fundamental), one can rank the consonance of<br/>different JI chords.</p><p>The only problem is an inability to measure the consonance<br/>of irrational intervals -- that&apos;s where harmonic entropy<br/>comes in.</p><p>&gt;&gt; ----The &quot;roughness&quot; models of consonance, central to the<br/>&gt;&gt; approach of Plomp &amp; Levelt, depend on critical-band effects<br/>&gt;&gt; and therefore on absolute frequencies.

Using pure sines to make music in 10-ET does NOT guarantee an<br/>&gt; absence of beating or other critical band effects, if that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what you meant by &quot;harmonic conflicts&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Back to &quot;sensory dissonance&quot; vs. &quot;musical dissonance&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know the formal definition of which is which...but from<br/>&gt; &gt; what I have read from you I believe my point could be stated as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;a 5 note widely spaced scale played with sine waves under<br/>&gt; &gt; 10-TET, although having more sensory consonance than a 7-note<br/>&gt; &gt; scale under 12-TET, fails to have the musical consonance of<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-TET&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hm. Sensory consonance refers to the part of consonance that<br/>&gt; exists solely in individual (isolated) sounds. Musical<br/>&gt; consonance refers to the function of sounds within musical<br/>&gt; compositions (it&apos;s more to do with grammar than just hearing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scales generally don&apos;t say much about either kind of consonance.<br/>&gt; In most scales, you can easily create sounds that have high<br/>&gt; sensory dissonance (just by mashing the keyboard). Some<br/>&gt; theorists believe certain scale properties are required to<br/>&gt; create musical consonance distinctions (e.g. must have a circle<br/>&gt; of approximate 3/2 &quot;fifths&quot;, etc.). But anyway, one doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; usually think of something like 12-ET as having consonance or<br/>&gt; dissonance in and of itself. One might reference something<br/>&gt; like &apos;common-practice music rendered in 12-ET&apos;...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ----How do you get that? Play all 7 tones of the 5-limit JI<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; diatonic scale at once, and then play the first 7 harmonics<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; at once -- which is more consonant?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I believe I mis-stated my point, I never meant &quot;harmonics<br/>&gt; &gt; vs. scales&quot;...I meant to say that, say, a JI scale in a higher<br/>&gt; &gt;limit can become quite dissonant: JI does not instantly equal<br/>&gt; &gt;consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One could argue that the sensory consonance of otonal chords<br/>&gt; in JI actually increases as you add higher and higher<br/>&gt; harmonics -- if the amplitude of each successive note<br/>&gt; decreases. The same is not true of subharmonics (Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;utonal&quot; chords), which rapidly become dissonant as you go<br/>&gt; up the series. However, the ratios required to spell extended<br/>&gt; utonal chords also become more complex very quickly, and<br/>&gt; usually &quot;JI&quot; entails something about ratios being simple.<br/>&gt; Complex ratios are also needed to make small intervals that<br/>&gt; would have strong critical band interactions. So JI does<br/>&gt; indeed seem to guarantee sensory consonance for chords.<br/>&gt; And by using Tenney Height (numerator * denominator of a<br/>&gt; ratio in lowest terms, or, by extension, a * b * c... of the<br/>&gt; notes in a chord, where a, b, and c are coprime integers over<br/>&gt; a common fundamental), one can rank the consonance of<br/>&gt; different JI chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only problem is an inability to measure the consonance<br/>&gt; of irrational intervals -- that&apos;s where harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; comes in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ----The &quot;roughness&quot; models of consonance, central to the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; approach of Plomp &amp; Levelt, depend on critical-band effects<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and therefore on absolute frequencies. JI-based models<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; depend only on the _relationships_ between frequencies.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     The thing that gets me.....is that Plomp &amp; Levelt&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; roughness model was used to form Sethares&apos;s consonance formula.<br/>&gt; &gt; And, assuming harmonics of more-or-less equal volume and whole-<br/>&gt; &gt; number-ratio harmonics, the dissonance curve has troughs (IE<br/>&gt; &gt; minimization points) at the 7-tone JI scale.

Since there seems to be no agreed-upon definition for some of<br/>these words, then in order to provide some kind of uniform naming<br/>convention, I propose the following definitions:</p><p>     Musical consonance is something that is relative to each person<br/>and has to do with how much &quot;sense&quot; you can make out of a chord. A<br/>bunch of random notes in 24-tet might not sound like it makes any<br/>sense to some observer, and so that&apos;d be heard as dissonant for that<br/>observer at this point in time. Maybe another observer hears it as<br/>being perfectly coherent -- the &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; effect, if you will.<br/>The Rite of Spring was heard as being completely disordered and<br/>chaotic back when it first premiered, but to my modern ears I hear<br/>consonances in that piece I had not known existed previously.<br/>     Besides the timbre that a chord is played on, what chords are<br/>played before and after a certain chord can guide a listener to hear a<br/>chord they would otherwise hear as &quot;dissonant&quot; as being &quot;consonant&quot; --<br/>this is another way of saying that the ear can be &quot;guided&quot; to make<br/>sense out of a chord that might be harder to digest immediately. I<br/>don&apos;t know how or if this relates to Harmonic Entropy, but it is an<br/>observation of mine nonetheless.</p><p>     Then we have the &quot;mood&quot; of a scale or chord. I often hear people<br/>saying things like that Ionian mode is &quot;consonant&quot; and that Phrygian<br/>mode is &quot;dissonant.&quot; Under the above definition, Phrygian mode can be<br/>heard as being consonant, but it sounds rather &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;,<br/>whatever. I propose that the &quot;mood&quot; of a scale, mode, or chord not be<br/>tied in with evaluations of its sonance. If a listener is unable to<br/>make any sense out of Phrygian mode and hears it as being completely<br/>noisy and clangy, then that scale would sound &quot;dissonant&quot; to them.</p><p>     Then we have what Carl termed &quot;musical consonance&quot;, which is<br/>whether or not a certain sound is &quot;appropriate&quot; in a certain gound of<br/>music. As musical genres have the envelope pushed constantly, these<br/>&quot;rules&quot; tend to be short-lived and broken rather quickly, so this I<br/>think is a different thing than the phenomenon I called &quot;sonance&quot;<br/>above.</p><p>     And it seems like concordance is related, as you put it, to the<br/>&quot;strength of the virtual pitch&quot; produced by a sound, so most chords<br/>will not be perfectly concordant -- an augmented chord, for example,<br/>will not. A sawtooth wave will sound more concordant than a sine wave<br/>played at the same pitch, and I&apos;d also say that a sine wave played in<br/>the mid register will be more concordant than a sine wave played in<br/>the bass register or extreme treble register (around 10,000 Hz or so),<br/>as most people have an extremely hard time placing those as &quot;pitches&quot;<br/>in a musical context.</p><p>     The names we use for these things I don&apos;t really care about -- I<br/>just want to point out that there are at least 4 distinct phenomena<br/>that we&apos;ve been lumping into two different words. The question: Are<br/>the phenomena that I have labeled &quot;accordance&quot; and &quot;sonance&quot; above<br/>really two sides of the same thing? Because if so, then the sounds<br/>played before and after any one sound would affect its perception of<br/>accordance, and repeated listenings would push a listener to hear a<br/>discordant sound as being more concordant over time, perhaps<br/>reflecting a gradual increase in the free variable in the HE equation<br/>(or perhaps not, but the observation stands nonetheless). As it stands<br/>now, I have never seen any parameter in HE that reflects how familiar<br/>the listener is with a certain dyad (or chord), or how the accordance<br/>of a dyad changes when surrounded with other dyads. If we really want<br/>to lump what I have termed sonance in as being a certain type of<br/>accordance, then those things should be taken into account, as they<br/>certainly exist.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=79008 href="#79008">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2008 5:31:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel like we are all using the same words to refer to different<br/>&gt; things, and it is extremely confusing to carry on a conversation<br/>&gt; this way.

They aren&apos;t that hard and I think you must<br/>&gt; be grokking them by now.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear to me what term you are using to denote which concept.<br/>There are four distinct phenomena that we&apos;ve mentioned:</p><p>1) the ability of an observer to make sense of a chord<br/>2) the mood of a chord or scale<br/>3) the strength of a pitch produced in the brain when a sound is heard, and<br/>4) the appropriateness of a chord or scale to a certain type of music.</p><p>So far, the term &quot;consonance&quot; has been thrown around at different<br/>times to mean all of these.</p><p>I proposed above that the &quot;sonance&quot; terms refer to the first<br/>phenomenon and to keep discussions of &quot;mood&quot; separate. It seems like<br/>you were saying that the strength of a pitch produced in the brain is<br/>what &quot;concordance&quot; is. You also referred to &quot;musical consonance&quot; as<br/>the appropriateness of a scale or chord in a certain genre of music,<br/>such as how one interval might be consonant in the blues but dissonant<br/>in Classical-era music, but I think that&apos;s a different phenomenon from<br/>the first thing, which is how I hear consonance being discussed from a<br/>musical standpoint.</p><p>What names would you propose for each of these four things? So far,<br/>we&apos;ve called them all &quot;consonance&quot; with the term &quot;concordance&quot; being<br/>thrown around to sometimes mean the strength of a pitch and sometimes<br/>to mean the coherence of a chord (with the implicit assumption that<br/>all observers are equal).</p><p>&gt; What do you want me to say? The xxxcordance words were brought<br/>&gt; in precisely to take priming out of the picture. If you want<br/>&gt; to maximize confusion, go ahead and use them the exact opposite<br/>&gt; purpose.</p><p>Well, it seemed like you were saying that phenomenon 1) and phenomenon<br/>4) were really two sides of the same coin. After all, if we had<br/>triadic harmonic entropy, wouldn&apos;t we be using it to model both 1) and<br/>4)? But if they really ARE two sides of the same coin, then priming<br/>effects and all of the things that apply to chords that are placed in<br/>time would therefore carry over into the other domain as well.</p><p>But who cares about priming? What I&apos;m really after is the effect<br/>whereby someone listening to a chord might hear it as being a bunch of<br/>clangy noise the first time, but after repeated listens starts to get<br/>the &quot;feeling&quot; of the chord. It is reasonable to think that it might<br/>correspond to some kind of &quot;strengthening&quot; of the way the brain<br/>processes periodicity - but who knows? Either way, it exists. So let&apos;s<br/>sum up from a to b:</p><p>1) Harmonies that sound &quot;incoherent&quot; under phenomenon 1) above will<br/>eventually start to sound &quot;coherent, yet complex&quot; under repeated<br/>listens.<br/>2) Thus, the perception of harmony is not equal for every observer. A<br/>chord might be perfectly coherent to one observer and incomprehensible<br/>mush to another.<br/>3) If what I&apos;ve called the &quot;coherence&quot; of a chord is actually the<br/>&quot;con/discordance&quot; of a chord, and that the &quot;con/discordance&quot; of a<br/>chord is represented mainly by the amount of entropy in the<br/>information going to the periodicity mechanism in the brain,<br/>   then:<br/>4) &quot;Discordant&quot; chords will sound more &quot;concordant&quot; over time to some observer.<br/>5) If real-life &quot;discordance&quot; or &quot;concordance&quot; truly is the output of<br/>the harmonic entropy function, then the real-life harmonic entropy<br/>function - how well the brain can &quot;place&quot; an interval - takes somehow<br/>as input how &quot;familiar&quot; it is with an interval. The brain will less<br/>confused by intervals that it has heard before, etc.</p><p>Is there any problem with that reasoning? If harmonic entropy solely<br/>describes the information content of a signal, and if accordance<br/>solely describes a perceptual attribute, then the theory around here<br/>is that harmonic entropy causes accordance with no other variables<br/>involved, correct? But observationally this doesn&apos;t apply to harmony -<br/>that familiarity variable is in there, and I don&apos;t see how the two can<br/>be rigorously and reasonably separated.</p><p>The information content of the input signal does not alone determine<br/>the observer&apos;s ability to process it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=79019 href="#79019">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2008 7:30:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consonance, concordance, sonance, musical vs sensory consonance, what JI is really made for or good for....&nbsp; We could pointlessly fight over these terms and what they mean and things like &quot;is JI the ultimate mathematics for tuning&quot; for ages.</p><p>&nbsp; But, was not the point in the first place to produce scales, be it from chords or otherwise, that are useful to musicians and listeners alike rather than prove each other right or wrong?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl is an expert musical historian, that seems obvious and just about everything I&apos;ve WIKI&apos;d against his word has turned out to match his word.&nbsp; But the title of this group appears to be &quot;tuning&quot; not &quot;the history of tuning&quot;, so would not it be more useful if we all stuck to ideas which actually help create and/or use good scales?</p><p>&nbsp; Also, granted, Carl knows a lot about this latter topic but, for sure, someone in this group likely has or will discover something is possible that Carl thought was not at some point in time.&nbsp; So why the bitterness?<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, back to a comment from a previous post (paraphrased) if 19 of 20 people think a various scale sounds better, regardless of history, we are likely onto something.&nbsp; And, even if it takes several tries to accomplish such a feat, aren&apos;t these the kind of discoveries a group like this is hoping for?</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Tue, 11/4/08, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Where&apos;s all that hostility coming from?: what&apos;s the basic formul<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Tuesday, November 4, 2008, 5:31 PM</p><p>            --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, &quot;Mike Battaglia&quot; &lt;battaglia01@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I feel like we are all using the same words to refer to different</p><p>&gt; things, and it is extremely confusing to carry on a conversation</p><p>&gt; this way.

I&apos;m taking the time to proof-read this<br/>post, since I&apos;ve noticed typos and crappy wording creeping<br/>in lately.  I&apos;ve also read yours entirely before starting<br/>my reply, and I think we&apos;ll be better off if you do the<br/>same (not to say you haven&apos;t been).  Frankly, I don&apos;t think<br/>reading before starting a reply is always necessary, but<br/>when threads go on like this it&apos;s got to be the right way.</p><p>&gt; 1) the ability of an observer to make sense of a chord</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;make sense&quot;.  Determining<br/>the pitch of a sound is one way of making sense of it.<br/>There may be others.</p><p>&gt; 2) the mood of a chord or scale</p><p>&quot;Mood&quot; is an ambiguous term.

It looks more like the four concepts you&apos;re<br/>interested in.</p><p>&gt; So far, the term &quot;consonance&quot; has been thrown around at<br/>&gt; different times to mean all of these.</p><p>Not by me.  I&apos;ve always said either &quot;musical consonance&quot;<br/>and &quot;sensory consonance&quot; OR &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;concordance&quot;,<br/>or replied directly to a block of text that made the context<br/>clear.  You&apos;ll notice in my posts that I take effort to<br/>put my contributions directly below a clearly-quoted block<br/>of text that contains the context for what I&apos;m adding.</p><p>&gt; I proposed above that the &quot;sonance&quot; terms refer to the first<br/>&gt; phenomenon and to keep discussions of &quot;mood&quot; separate.</p><p>You&apos;re a smart guy and obviously a decent musician.  But<br/>do you really think the time is apt for you to be coining<br/>terms?  I mean, you shouldn&apos;t complain that you don&apos;t<br/>understand the existing concepts and coin new ones in the<br/>same breath.  At least, I wouldn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; It seems like<br/>&gt; you were saying that the strength of a pitch produced in the<br/>&gt; brain is what &quot;concordance&quot; is.</p><p>ONE part of it.</p><p>&gt; You also referred to &quot;musical consonance&quot; as<br/>&gt; the appropriateness of a scale or chord in a certain genre<br/>&gt; of music, such as how one interval might be consonant in<br/>&gt; the blues but dissonant in Classical-era music, but I think<br/>&gt; that&apos;s a different phenomenon from the first thing, which is<br/>&gt; how I hear consonance being discussed from a musical standpoint.</p><p>I hardly need to tell you what musical consonance is.  If<br/>you&apos;ve been to conservatory or taken college music theory<br/>or even high school music theory or even worked through a<br/>rudimentary guitar or piano book, you know how musicians<br/>use the term &quot;consonance&quot;.  V7 (which is a chord not an<br/>interval) is not a consonance in classical music, but is a<br/>consonance in the blues.  I have no idea what you mean by<br/>&quot;make sense of a chord&quot; but it&apos;s probably correct.</p><p>What matters here is not defining what musical consonance<br/>is, but simply agreeing what sensory consonance is not.  It&apos;s<br/>not #2 or #4, and until more meat is added, it&apos;s not #1<br/>either.  Does that help?</p><p>&gt; What names would you propose for each of these four things?</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t.  :)</p><p>&gt; the term &quot;concordance&quot; being<br/>&gt; thrown around to sometimes mean the strength of a pitch and<br/>&gt; sometimes to mean the coherence of a chord (with the implicit<br/>&gt; assumption that all observers are equal).</p><p>That assumption has hardly been implicit.  I&apos;ve mentioned<br/>already several times the partially-objective nature of<br/>the phenomenon.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What do you want me to say?

Let&apos;s back up.</p><p>Your original post in this microthread was, as I read it,<br/>a complaint that nobody is addressing what I might call<br/>&apos;music psychology&apos;.  And you&apos;ve basically made that same<br/>complaint several times in the past.</p><p>As before, I can respond by saying that I (for one) am not<br/>interested in psychology.

If you disagree, a sure way to make<br/>progress would be to post a constructive theory relating<br/>psychology and intonation.</p><p>&gt; After all, if we had triadic harmonic entropy, wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; we be using it to model both 1)</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>&gt; and 4)?</p><p>No.  How could we?</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;m really after is the effect whereby someone listening<br/>&gt; to a chord might hear it as being a bunch of clangy noise the<br/>&gt; first time, but after repeated listens starts to get the<br/>&gt; &quot;feeling&quot; of the chord. It is reasonable to think that it<br/>&gt; might correspond to some kind of &quot;strengthening&quot; of the way<br/>&gt; the brain processes periodicity</p><p>I don&apos;t think so, no.  Because a &quot;feeling&quot; is a very high-level<br/>abstraction that comes out of the most complex phenomenon in<br/>the known universe (human intelligence).  It involves many,<br/>many kinds of perceptions and memories and the activity of<br/>some neurons in the inferior colliculus are likely to play a<br/>very small part in it.  Does that make sense?</p><p>&gt; 2) Thus, the perception of harmony is not equal for every<br/>&gt; observer.</p><p>harmony != consonance != concordance</p><p>So, I don&apos;t know what this means.</p><p>&gt; Is there any problem with that reasoning?</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;ve lost you.  Perhaps it would be better to stick<br/>to concrete examples as much as possible.</p><p>&gt; If harmonic entropy solely describes the information<br/>&gt; content of a signal,</p><p>It doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; and if accordance solely describes a perceptual attribute,<br/>&gt; then the theory around here is that harmonic entropy causes<br/>&gt; accordance with no other variables involved, correct?</p><p>I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s claiming harmonic entropy soley<br/>captures anything.  It&apos;s the &quot;simplest possible model&quot; of<br/>concordance, according to Paul.  I don&apos;t even agree with<br/>that but it&apos;s certainly one of the simplest.

You can buy an AXiS honeycomb keyboard for<br/>$2000.  Jon Catler will sell you a ready-made microtonal<br/>guitar.  I have gigabytes of microtonal music on my PC, and<br/>many dozen CDs.

There are four distinct phenomena that we&apos;ve</p><p>&gt; mentioned:</p><p>Sorry.  I&apos;ve tried to explain it every way I can think of.</p><p>I&apos;ll try once more.  I&apos;m taking the time to proof-read this</p><p>post, since I&apos;ve noticed typos and crappy wording creeping</p><p>in lately.  I&apos;ve also read yours entirely before starting</p><p>my reply, and I think we&apos;ll be better off if you do the</p><p>same (not to say you haven&apos;t been).  Frankly, I don&apos;t think</p><p>reading before starting a reply is always necessary, but</p><p>when threads go on like this it&apos;s got to be the right way.</p><p>&gt; 1) the ability of an observer to make sense of a chord</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;make sense&quot;.  Determining</p><p>the pitch of a sound is one way of making sense of it.</p><p>There may be others.</p><p>&gt; 2) the mood of a chord or scale</p><p>&quot;Mood&quot; is an ambiguous term.  I&apos;ve not used it at all in</p><p>this thread.</p><p>&gt; 3) the strength of a pitch produced in the brain when a</p><p>&gt; sound is heard, and</p><p>This is one principle component of concordance.  The other</p><p>principle component being a lack of roughness/beating.</p><p>&gt; 4) the appropriateness of a chord or scale to a certain</p><p>&gt; type of music.</p><p>Completely out of the scope of anything psychoacoustics</p><p>can handle.</p><p>And these four are hardly a complete list of concepts</p><p>mentioned!  It looks more like the four concepts you&apos;re</p><p>interested in.</p><p>&gt; So far, the term &quot;consonance&quot; has been thrown around at</p><p>&gt; different times to mean all of these.</p><p>Not by me.  I&apos;ve always said either &quot;musical consonance&quot;</p><p>and &quot;sensory consonance&quot; OR &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;concordance&quot; ,</p><p>or replied directly to a block of text that made the context</p><p>clear.  You&apos;ll notice in my posts that I take effort to</p><p>put my contributions directly below a clearly-quoted block</p><p>of text that contains the context for what I&apos;m adding.</p><p>&gt; I proposed above that the &quot;sonance&quot; terms refer to the first</p><p>&gt; phenomenon and to keep discussions of &quot;mood&quot; separate.</p><p>You&apos;re a smart guy and obviously a decent musician.  But</p><p>do you really think the time is apt for you to be coining</p><p>terms?  I mean, you shouldn&apos;t complain that you don&apos;t</p><p>understand the existing concepts and coin new ones in the</p><p>same breath.  At least, I wouldn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; It seems like</p><p>&gt; you were saying that the strength of a pitch produced in the</p><p>&gt; brain is what &quot;concordance&quot; is.</p><p>ONE part of it.</p><p>&gt; You also referred to &quot;musical consonance&quot; as</p><p>&gt; the appropriateness of a scale or chord in a certain genre</p><p>&gt; of music, such as how one interval might be consonant in</p><p>&gt; the blues but dissonant in Classical-era music, but I think</p><p>&gt; that&apos;s a different phenomenon from the first thing, which is</p><p>&gt; how I hear consonance being discussed from a musical standpoint.</p><p>I hardly need to tell you what musical consonance is.  If</p><p>you&apos;ve been to conservatory or taken college music theory</p><p>or even high school music theory or even worked through a</p><p>rudimentary guitar or piano book, you know how musicians</p><p>use the term &quot;consonance&quot; .  V7 (which is a chord not an</p><p>interval) is not a consonance in classical music, but is a</p><p>consonance in the blues.  I have no idea what you mean by</p><p>&quot;make sense of a chord&quot; but it&apos;s probably correct.</p><p>What matters here is not defining what musical consonance</p><p>is, but simply agreeing what sensory consonance is not.  It&apos;s</p><p>not #2 or #4, and until more meat is added, it&apos;s not #1</p><p>either.  Does that help?</p><p>&gt; What names would you propose for each of these four things?</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t.  :)</p><p>&gt; the term &quot;concordance&quot; being</p><p>&gt; thrown around to sometimes mean the strength of a pitch and</p><p>&gt; sometimes to mean the coherence of a chord (with the implicit</p><p>&gt; assumption that all observers are equal).</p><p>That assumption has hardly been implicit.  I&apos;ve mentioned</p><p>already several times the partially-objective nature of</p><p>the phenomenon.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What do you want me to say? The xxxcordance words were brought</p><p>&gt; &gt; in precisely to take priming out of the picture. If you want</p><p>&gt; &gt; to maximize confusion, go ahead and use them the exact opposite</p><p>&gt; &gt; purpose.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Well, it seemed like you were saying that phenomenon 1) and</p><p>&gt; phenomenon 4) were really two sides of the same coin.</p><p>To me it seems like you are trying to interpret everything</p><p>I say in terms of what you want to hear.  Let&apos;s back up.</p><p>Your original post in this microthread was, as I read it,</p><p>a complaint that nobody is addressing what I might call</p><p>&apos;music psychology&apos;.  And you&apos;ve basically made that same</p><p>complaint several times in the past.</p><p>As before, I can respond by saying that I (for one) am not</p><p>interested in psychology.  And even if I were, I think it&apos;s</p><p>an inquiry on a fundamentally different level than what</p><p>theories of &apos;music intonation&apos; (the subject of this mailing</p><p>list) can address.  If you disagree, a sure way to make</p><p>progress would be to post a constructive theory relating</p><p>psychology and intonation.</p><p>&gt; After all, if we had triadic harmonic entropy, wouldn&apos;t</p><p>&gt; we be using it to model both 1)</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>&gt; and 4)?</p><p>No.  How could we?</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;m really after is the effect whereby someone listening</p><p>&gt; to a chord might hear it as being a bunch of clangy noise the</p><p>&gt; first time, but after repeated listens starts to get the</p><p>&gt; &quot;feeling&quot; of the chord. It is reasonable to think that it</p><p>&gt; might correspond to some kind of &quot;strengthening&quot; of the way</p><p>&gt; the brain processes periodicity</p><p>I don&apos;t think so, no.  Because a &quot;feeling&quot; is a very high-level</p><p>abstraction that comes out of the most complex phenomenon in</p><p>the known universe (human intelligence) .  It involves many,</p><p>many kinds of perceptions and memories and the activity of</p><p>some neurons in the inferior colliculus are likely to play a</p><p>very small part in it.  Does that make sense?</p><p>&gt; 2) Thus, the perception of harmony is not equal for every</p><p>&gt; observer.</p><p>harmony != consonance != concordance</p><p>So, I don&apos;t know what this means.</p><p>&gt; Is there any problem with that reasoning?</p><p>Sorry, I&apos;ve lost you.  Perhaps it would be better to stick</p><p>to concrete examples as much as possible.</p><p>&gt; If harmonic entropy solely describes the information</p><p>&gt; content of a signal,</p><p>It doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; and if accordance solely describes a perceptual attribute,</p><p>&gt; then the theory around here is that harmonic entropy causes</p><p>&gt; accordance with no other variables involved, correct?</p><p>I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s claiming harmonic entropy soley</p><p>captures anything.  It&apos;s the &quot;simplest possible model&quot; of</p><p>concordance, according to Paul.  I don&apos;t even agree with</p><p>that but it&apos;s certainly one of the simplest.

This goes right into my topic of &quot;why the arguing about terminology&quot; as well.&nbsp; Sethares was largely responsible for my interest in micro-tonal in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Before him I though all micro-tonal was...was either</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Just Intonation, Mean tone, temperaments like 24TET that were basically used like 12TET with the option of using the other 12 notes as &quot;neighboring tones&quot;, and other tunings all with the &quot;mission&quot; of estimating Just Intonation intervals in different ways.&nbsp; IE it didn&apos;t really seem micro-tonal so much as &quot;a different way to do the same thing&quot;<br/>-----------------or------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Many &quot;random&quot; scales that could be played melodically but NEVER consonantly in harmony...even though they are very fresh and interesting for melodies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard his song &quot;Ten Fingers&quot; in 10TET, which has intervals that are nothing like 12TET, I thought &quot;wow...now this sounds completely fresh with completely new feel and moods...and yet is not too far from the usual Just Intonation sense of resolve/&apos;consonance&apos;&quot;.&nbsp; And I read up on him and learned about critical bands, overtone shifting...and how he uses those things to bend timbers and scales to &quot;match&quot; each other.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since then I have been obsessed with the idea of trying to make a scale that&apos;s virtually as chord-capable as Just Intonation, but sounds distinctly very different from 12TET, mean-tone, or any other Just Intonation-like scale.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I am here (in this case) to find &quot;the minimum number of psychoacoustic principles I need to adhere to&quot; and &quot;psychoacoustic principle(s) that have not been fully exploited and can lead to more possibilities&quot;.&nbsp; The principle Sethares found that opened things up was that of using technology to manipulate timbre/overtones to match scale.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize if I adhere to virtually all of history&apos;s psychoacoustic ideas I just get stuck with something like Just Intonation or learn why 12TET is so annoyingly dominant.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why I want to learn more about psychoacoustics, but not to the point all I am doing is learning that what I am trying to do is impossible (LOL). :-D</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put...I am trying to find a gap in psychoacoustics that allows me to take alternative routes to making new scales.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is why, for example, the idea of periodicity being necessary in scales for &quot;concordance&quot; interests me...though, at the same time, I am not interested in saying &quot;oh well, current theories on that say I have to match either JI or the harmonic theories, so I give up&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping to find a clever gap in theories, much like Sethares did, at least in part, when he made 10TET &quot;almost tolerable&quot;.<br/>*****************************************************************************************</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the record, Carl, I well understand you are interested in the future of micro-tonal and not simply regurgitating its history.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, listening to you I often feel like I am getting 10 different sets of directions to go to the same old Just Intonation or Harmonic Series related theories.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you, like myself, are eager to express your knowledge in such a way it becomes obvious were &quot;spots for possible innovation&quot; lie I wish you would make it more obvious.&nbsp; I am learning a lot from you, I just don&apos;t want to get so into history that I learn my way into giving up. :-)</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=79036 href="#79036">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2008 6:50:36 PM</span><button style="float: right;

The other two don&apos;t matter.  7<br/>sine waves per octave will have roughness.

You can do the same with<br/>Mohajira.  There are two sets of notes, each a chain of fifths.  In a<br/>meantone temperament they&apos;re 9-limit intervals with no 7s.  So temper<br/>the scale accordingly, use the right timbre, and but each chain on a<br/>different ear.</p><p>&gt; In fact, I am praying someone can come up with a clever way to do this.<br/>&gt; It would likely lead to a compositional utopia: a scale that&apos;s infinitely<br/>&gt; flexible about itself concerning note combinations that is not limited to 5<br/>&gt; notes.</p><p>If you want infinitely flexible there&apos;s also adaptive tuning.  I&apos;ve<br/>thought about this with miracle temperament.  You can write with 10<br/>notes to the octave and let the computer decide the inequality.  This<br/>is also, of course, related to Sethares&apos; work with 10-equal.</p><p>Another thing I&apos;ve thought about: the miraculous decimal scale<br/>naturally breaks down into two pentatonics.  Each is roughly the<br/>&quot;Pygmy&quot; scale</p><p>1/1 7/8 21/16 3/2 12/7 2/1</p><p>That&apos;s a no 5&apos;s scale with only the 21:16 intervals outside the<br/>9-limit.  I&apos;ve tried retuning the 5th partial to give 21:16 instead of<br/>5:4 but I&apos;m afraid it doesn&apos;t blend very well.  Still, it&apos;s a thought<br/>and it might still be better than a 10-equal timbre.  And then you can<br/>put on of these scales in each ear to get a total of 10 notes (3 more<br/>than you ordered).</p><p>You can also try mixing this with adaptive temperament to get 4:3<br/>instead of 21:16 when you need it.  Or Negri temperament, where the<br/>two pentatonics are naturally 9-limit but further from JI.</p><p>&gt;     Also...maybe there are further (maybe a fourth and fifth) psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; standard we can take advantage of/alleviate to twist our way to a &quot;perfectly<br/>&gt; consonant&quot; seven-plus note scale that could compete with, if not super-cede,<br/>&gt; 12-TET and other scales that simply approximate Just Intonation.</p><p>One thing I think&apos;s missing from this thread is that there seem to be<br/>two different kinds of fusion.  One, octave equivalent, gives us chord<br/>roots and the strike notes of bells.  The perceived pitch corresponds<br/>to a low, strong partial.

For example:</p><p>A) Reducing binaural beating to a reasonable level instead of normal beating becomes an issue.&nbsp; The advantage is the ear seems much less picky about binaural beating thus allowing closer note spacing across channels than in the same channel...but pushing too close can still cause problems.<br/>B) My experiments so far by ear seem to say chords in mean-tone and 12ET have binaural beating problems.&nbsp; That&apos;s why I am trying to create special scales for binaural use rather than just shove sections/chords of 12ET or other just-intonation-like scales in separate channels.<br/>C) Much like with adaptive tuning, I have found random tone separation &quot;on demand&quot; leaves the mind struggling to catch up with the adaptive panning changes, regardless of how consonant they are.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for binaural panning to &quot;work&quot;, I think it helps a lot if each frequency is assigned a permanent panning position.&nbsp; This is done as common knowledge in professional production of instruments like drums anyhow.&nbsp;<br/>D) The other thing is, the notes panned to each side must be aligned to produce consonant chords on each side of the spectrum.&nbsp;<br/>__________________________________________________</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, for sure, you need both C) and D) to be satisfied to improve a piece musically by making it &quot;binaural&quot;: you can&apos;t just snap random panning positions on any notes that clash.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It&apos;s usually<br/>advertised as &apos;transparency&apos; of tone. But the great contrast here is<br/>really around 1800 when the harpsichord-like ringing tone of early<br/>pianos (eg J.A.

It also supported longer string lengths, which again<br/>helps harmonicity.  As for it suppressing higher harmonics,<br/>I&apos;m dubious.

Graf knew all to well that B&apos;s<br/>hearing would prevent him from hearing the fact that the ting couldn&apos;<br/>really be put in proper tune, and in any event, he wasn&apos;t long for<br/>this world. Graf&apos;s further motivation is demonstrated by what he<br/>actually did; on the day after B died, he had the boys from the<br/>factory go round B&apos;s house, returning the Broadwood and collecting his<br/>instrument. He then had the guys down in veneering engrave &quot;L. van<br/>Beethoven&quot; across the front of the damper rail, and he promptly sold<br/>&quot;the Instrument of the Great Master&quot; to some unsuspecting Viennese<br/>doctor, effectively turning a sow&apos;s ear into a silk purse. The<br/>duplicity is further supported by the &quot;certificate of authenticity&quot;<br/>Graf issued, which use some slippery language, can&apos;t remember exactly<br/>what the wording is, but something to the effect of &quot;made by me *a few<br/>years* before the great master&apos;s death&quot;. Graf was a very slick<br/>operator who invested heavily in Viennese real estate, and sold the<br/>piano biz in 1839 just before the bottom fell out of the market for<br/>the Viennese style.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=79282 href="#79282">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2008 12:54:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;In today&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments the &apos;aliquot strings&apos; are tuned in unison with the<br/>&gt; trichords.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>Please attend here, that I introduced my statement with the word:<br/>&gt; &gt; !!!
