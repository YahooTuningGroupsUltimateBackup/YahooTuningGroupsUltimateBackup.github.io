The harmonium follows<br/>&gt; you&quot;.  Now, English is not his native language, so I guess that statement<br/>&gt; could be interpreted various ways.</p><p>He&apos;s telling you to ignore the harmonium while<br/>you&apos;re singing.</p><p>&gt;  Mine is that its ok to use the harmonium<br/>&gt; if you are a beginning vocal student (such as myself) and trying to get a<br/>&gt; rough handle on the raags, but don&apos;t use it as a crutch. He also advised that<br/>&gt; it is preferable to practice with a drone instrument such as a tambura (or an<br/>&gt; &quot;electric tambura&quot; box like the one he brings to class) rather than with a<br/>&gt; harmonium.</p><p>That&apos;s right. When you hear how all the rags<br/>are in the drone of a tabura, what they are really<br/>saying is all the intervals of raga tuning are there<br/>in the overtones of the drone.</p><p>When I first started singing lessons last September,<br/>I tried to practice with a vibrato free reed organ patch<br/>on one of my synths (tuned 1/1. 3/2). No go! I had real<br/>problems singing simple intervals in a diatonic scale.<br/>When I got my paws on a tambura cd, it all became much<br/>easier!</p><p>&gt; When I saw P. Jasraj in concert with Suman and others, there was a harmonium<br/>&gt; player involved.  He did not provide the drone (there were four tambura<br/>&gt; players onstage already), but instead played raags himself on his harmonium,<br/>&gt; thus functioning as just another &quot;voice&quot; on stage.  P. Jasraj occasionally<br/>&gt; also accompanied his vocals with his own harp-like instrument,</p><p>Swarmandal?</p><p>&gt; but he always<br/>&gt; tuned it between raags.  He did not appear to use the harmonium to guide his<br/>&gt; tuning - I think he was using the drone boxes then tuning the other strings to<br/>&gt; the desired raag on that base drone note.</p><p>That&apos;s right.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next time I see Suman-ji, I will ask him if harmonium players &quot;tune&quot; their<br/>&gt; harmoniums for concerts.</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>&gt; If not, I suspect the way the pitch ornamentations<br/>&gt; of the vocalists are reconciled with harmoniums (if a player is present) is<br/>&gt; very similar to the way a blues harmonica player would play with a pianist.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll try to ask him about this too.   But keep him mind that while he is very<br/>&gt; intelligent and his English quite good, he is not likely to understand me if I<br/>&gt; use the words &quot;7-limit just intonation&quot; and the like; I&apos;m trying to learn<br/>&gt; these concepts myself!</p><p>I think the singing would be compromised. Prandit Pran Nath<br/>was against harmoniums. Mashkor Ali Khan, a younger distant<br/>cousin, however uses a Swarmandal and a harmonium. A few<br/>of his American students are trying to talk him out of<br/>the harmonium.</p><p>nada bhrama,<br/>db</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=10674 href="#10674">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2000 10:27:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very strange -- this e-mail was not in my inbox, but today I&apos;m<br/>posting from <a href="http://egroups.com">egroups.com</a>, and this message was here.
