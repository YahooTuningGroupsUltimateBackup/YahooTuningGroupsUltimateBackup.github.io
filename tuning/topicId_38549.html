That&apos;s 7 bits of resolution. Most keyboard and rack<br/>synthesizers support 8 bits of pitch bend, some support 10 bits.  Some<br/>may receive and decode all 14 bits, but that&apos;s almost impossible to<br/>determine since nobody publishes those numbers.  In my case I use a MIDI<br/>to Control Voltage converter with 14 bits of pitch bend resolution.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense to me to do anything less than 14<br/>bits of pitch bend resolution for Windows/Mac/etc. software.  It&apos;s not<br/>as if there&apos;s a hardware or processing limitation for OS based software.<br/>The worst that happens is the receiving device throws away the unused<br/>bits.</p><p>Algorithmic Arts web site is located at <a href="http://algoart.com/">http://algoart.com/</a>. They make a<br/>very interesting Windows based sequencer and algorithmic composition<br/>tool based upon the paradigm of old analog style sequencers.  Check it<br/>out.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:jloffink@austin.rr.com">jloffink@austin.rr.com</a></p></div>
