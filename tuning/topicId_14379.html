For example,<br/>the syntonic comma of 21.5 cents comes from tuning four fifths up and a<br/>major third down, so its prime vector coordinates are (4, -1). The<br/>diaschisma of 19.6 cents comes from tuning four fifths down and two major<br/>thirds down, so its prime vector coordinates are (-4,-2). Now one writes<br/>these vectors in a matrix:</p><p>(-4 -2)<br/>(     )<br/>( 4 -1)</p><p>Then one calculates the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of the<br/>matrix</p><p>( a  b)<br/>(     )<br/>( c  d)</p><p>is written</p><p>| a  b|<br/>|     |<br/>| c  d|</p><p>and equals a*d - b*c.</p><p>So</p><p>|-4 -2|<br/>|     | = (-4)*(-1) - 4*(-2) = 4 - (-8) = 12.<br/>| 4 -1|</p><p>So somehow the syntonic comma and the diaschima give a 12-tone scale. You<br/>can try this for many sets of commas, including ones involving the primes 7<br/>and 11 (for which you need 3-by-3 and 4-by-4 matrices, and somehow the<br/>determinant always gives you the number of notes in some system that has<br/>been used or proposed somewhere in the world at some time.</p><p>This may seem like magic, or more likely, luck, to a skeptical observer. But<br/>it isn&apos;t -- and the explanation is provided in the _Gentle Introduction_.<br/>The determinant counts the number of equivalence classes on the just lattice<br/>that exist when the commas are considered to generate an equivalence<br/>relation. Hence, the determinant counts the number of categorically distinct<br/>pitches one can find by starting at a given pitch in the just lattice and<br/>adding more and more pitches, through consonances with one another,<br/>discarding any new pitch if it is a comma away from a starting pitch.</p><p>What I&apos;m seeing in Pierre&apos;s work is a mysterious mathematical formalism,<br/>which I haven&apos;t seen presented in its entirety, but I must assume is quite<br/>simple and beautiful. What I&apos;m not seeing an inkling of is the &quot;explanation&quot;<br/>-- the demonstration that reduces the mathematical abstraction to a<br/>straightforward set of rules grounded in acoustics, psychology, or a<br/>combination of the two.</p><p>I&apos;ll be very happy if Pierre proceeds without providing any such<br/>&quot;explanation&quot;. What seemed to infuriate him was the idea that I might come<br/>up with such an &quot;explanation&quot; for him. I hope Pierre will forgive me for any<br/>arrogance and/or misinterpretation that this suggestion may have implied,<br/>and proceed as if it had never been brought up.</p><p>Pierre?</p></div>
