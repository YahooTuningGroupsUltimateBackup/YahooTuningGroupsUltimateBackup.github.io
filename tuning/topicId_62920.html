The method I finally chose is something<br/>which I believe people must have noticed many centuries ago as it works<br/>pretty nicely indeed. Applying this to the modern 21st century<br/>possibilities, you may even take an ordinary handworn watch that makes<br/>regular ticks usually at a speed of one per second (some watches tick 5<br/>times per second, which is not very appropriate in these cases) as it is not<br/>always possible to have a metronome with you. Of course, you can freely use<br/>this method with any starting pitch you like. But the very best results come<br/>out if you choose an A4 of 430Hz (i.e. as in the 18th century or so).<br/>OK, now how to do it? As I wish the tuning to be a very good approximation<br/>of quarter-comma meantone indeed, I start by tuning A4 to 430Hz. This is the<br/>only situation when you need something like an external tuner as you<br/>probably won&apos;t find the exact 430Hz just by ear. But from now on, you can<br/>put your tuner away and just listen carefully. Now, I take D4 as a fifth<br/>downwards from A4 and I tune it slightly higher than in the case of a pure<br/>fifth - by &quot;slightly higher&quot; I mean in such a way that I can hear exactly 8<br/>beats per 3 seconds. Then, I take E4 as a fourth downwards from A4 and I<br/>tune it slightly lower than if the fourth was pure - by &quot;slightly lower&quot; I<br/>mean in such a way that I can hear exactly 4 beats per second. Then, I take<br/>B4 as a fifth upwards from E4 and I tune it slightly lower than for a pure<br/>fifth - i.e. in such a way that I can hear exactly 3 beats per second.<br/>Finally, the most time-consuming step takes place as all the other tones of<br/>the meantone chain are tuned as pure major thirds or minor sixths from the<br/>tones which I have already tuned.<br/>Provided that it makes no harm to the instrument in question to have A4 at<br/>430Hz and that the overtones of the instrument deviate from the harmonic<br/>series no more than just very slightly, what comes out as a result is right<br/>what I&apos;m sending in the regular Scala format at the end of this message. If<br/>you look at the chain carefully, you can see the maximum deviation from the<br/>exact quarter-comma temperament is no more than about 1/60 of a cent!<br/>Petr</p><p>! meanqratapprox.scl<br/>!
