Fuze has been playing fretless for a while, and also has been<br/>experimenting with 24 and 36 eq. It doesn&apos;t say what axes are on the CD,<br/>sounds like a lot of fretless to me. Definitely a lot of interesting<br/>tones going down. Also, although this is a few years older, the &quot;Nordic<br/>Four&quot; CD, featuring Terje Rypdal and John Surman, is another very good<br/>session...way out there, in the best ECM tradition. Rypdal has always<br/>been a favorite of mine, and I&apos;ve often thought he didn&apos;t get enough<br/>recognition in the guitar world. He was a trailblazer, and on this CD,<br/>creates some very deep soundscapes...happy holiday listening...Hstick<br/>PS...what new music have y&apos;all been listening to lately?</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2001 12:54:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Neil,</p><p>I had Jazzpunk in my sweaty little hands just this Saturday, but faced<br/>with the choice of getting what I was ostensibly at Borders for (a<br/>gift certificate) and some new guitar music to check out I did the<br/>right thing--no CD for me!</p><p>Have you heard this CD Neil? I know he plays the fretless-12-tet<br/>double neck, and I&apos;ve heard some enticing excerpts, but if I&apos;ve got to<br/>get one, Jazzpunk or Amandala, which one&apos;s the one to get?</p><p>I&apos;ve always loved Rypdal. I love the early Nordic Miles stuff,<br/>especially the first cut off of his self titled CD, &quot;Keep it like<br/>that - tight&quot;. What a great cut, they keep the groove pregnant from<br/>start to finish, and check out Garbarek&apos;s entrance on tenor! After The<br/>Rain is another Rypdal fave, actually that&apos;s my very favorite.</p><p>I just got an advance copy of Absolute Zero&apos;s new CD Crashing Icons<br/>with new drummer Pip Pyle Monday, and while I&apos;m still soaking it up,<br/>there&apos;s no doubt that it&apos;s a mighty earful and then some! Imagine a<br/>rougher more stripped down U Totem, and you&apos;ll have some idea of<br/>what&apos;s going on. They&apos;re steadily moving in the direction of micro<br/>tuning too, and I&apos;m sure that some subsequent project is going to do<br/>so.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:STICK@USWEST.NET">STICK@USWEST.NET</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, December 26, 2001 9:00 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Hot stuff</p><p>&gt;    For all of you geetar fans, check out David Fiuczynski&apos;s latest,<br/>&gt; &quot;Amandala.&quot; Stellar, creative chops, not many cliches, heavy<br/>bass/drum<br/>&gt; grooves, and really interesting compositional ideas...this one&apos;s a<br/>&gt; keeper.

Who are<br/>the other players on this CD? I&apos;ve also been interested in Lunar (Crash,<br/>Crush) whatever... with Medeski, since anything with Medeski on B3 has<br/>potential in my mind.</p><p>For a (somewhat) group relevent recent CD purchase there is Mr Lucky<br/>which is J Granellis band with Dave Tronzo on the bottleneck guitar.<br/>Dave has been playing in the cracks for ages.</p><p>Something I heard on the radio that Santa seems to be bringing me<br/>is The Word, with Robert Randolph (?) a brilliant young slide player<br/>and Medeski doing gospel music.</p><p>Also, not microtonal but another nice spin for fretted instrument<br/>fans is Perpetual Motion, with classical repetoire played by Bela<br/>Fleck on banjo. It actually sounds very appropriate as the banjo<br/>produces a  &apos;plink with fast decay&apos; that is reminiscent of<br/>harpsichord or clavichord. He is joined by same interesting others<br/>in slightly unusual arrangements of classical chestnuts.</p><p>And I&apos;ve been spinning a lot of Bill Frisell lately, an older<br/>CD with Ginger Baker and Charlie Haden and his newest with Dave<br/>Holland and Elvin Jones.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2001 1:55:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;ve been spinning a lot of Bill Frisell lately, an older<br/>&gt; CD with Ginger Baker and Charlie Haden and his newest with Dave<br/>&gt; Holland and Elvin Jones.</p><p>These are among the best CDs I&apos;ve heard of jazz from the past decade.<br/>The new one is just breathtaking.</p></div><h3>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2001 4:20:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I&apos;ve been spinning a lot of Bill Frisell lately, an older<br/>&gt; &gt; CD with Ginger Baker and Charlie Haden and his newest with Dave<br/>&gt; &gt; Holland and Elvin Jones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are among the best CDs I&apos;ve heard of jazz from the past<br/>decade.<br/>&gt; The new one is just breathtaking.</p><p>and samples can be heard here in Real Audio:<br/><a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=75597962420">http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=75597962420</a></p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
