Here&apos;s my gossipy<br/>holliday letter to the alternate tuning family-<br/>&#x9;Haverstick and I are beginning rehearsals today for my CD of<br/>microtonal pop. The tunes cover many styles including ska, reggae, punk,<br/>blues, country and jazz. I know this is a no-no from a marketing<br/>standpoint, but I am on a limited budget and want to showcase only my<br/>best work. We will play in 19, 31 and 34 TET. My stepson Randy is<br/>learning the guitar building trade and I am having him make me a 31TET<br/>bass. The Form CD got a pretty decent review in the local weekly<br/>Westword, and the local jazz station has been playing Haverstick&apos;s Jazz<br/>19 with a poetry overlay regularly, although they never mention that it<br/>is out of tune. Maybe that is a good thing. I came across a Greek<br/>internet radio station, and much of the music they played was with a<br/>combination of 12TET backgrounds and obviously non 12 melodies. It works<br/>pretty well, and I&apos;ll post the URL when I get back to work. Thanks, Mark<br/>and whoever else started this forum.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</a></p></div>
