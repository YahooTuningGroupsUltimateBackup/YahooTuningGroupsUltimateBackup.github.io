While Webern studiously avoided<br/>these, Schoenberg knew they could happen and didn&apos;t try overly<br/>hard to prevent it, and Berg positively made use of the idea.</p><p>Berg&apos;s _Violin Concerto_, in particular, has a row which is structured<br/>so as to stack &quot;3rds&quot;, so that he is able to create consonant<br/>triads and &quot;7th&quot;-chords and thus emulate tonal harmony in a<br/>fleeting manner.</p><p>But other than that, I&apos;d say that Bob is right on the money.</p><p>Schoenberg made it clear in his paper _Problems of Harmony_<br/>(as well as in other essays that have been published in<br/>_Style and Idea_) that the original goal of the &quot;atonal&quot; style<br/>was to explore using the higher harmonics (meaning above 5) as<br/>consonant chord-members.  The idea was to avoid all reference<br/>to 3- and 5-limit harmony, and concentrate on tonal relationships<br/>which imply prime-factors 7, 11, and 13.  He states even there<br/>that &quot;a future time&quot; may permit use of 3 and 5 along with the<br/>higher primes, but that during those early days he and his<br/>students wanted to concentrate on using the higher primes.</p><p>(This is *my* version of what I think Schoenberg meant...<br/>he did not speak clearly in terms of prime-limits or ratios,<br/>other than the endorsment of the &quot;possibly incorrect overtone<br/>theory&quot;, the strict application of which does indeed make it<br/>possible to understand his theory in the terms I use.)</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32263 href="#32263">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2002 6:30:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_32256.html#32256">/tuning/topicId_32256.html#32256</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, I didn&apos;t comment on Bob&apos;s post, but it&apos;s interesting that you<br/>&gt; are being &quot;contrary&quot; here, because the first time I read it, I<br/>thought<br/>&gt; it was an excellent summary of Schoenberg&apos;s (and his students&apos;s)<br/>goals<br/>&gt; with the &quot;12-tone method&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Monz...</p><p>My *own* understanding was that Schoenberg was not trying to *avoid*<br/>*anything* at all.

The idea was to avoid all reference<br/>&gt;&gt; to 3- and 5-limit harmony, and concentrate on tonal relationships<br/>&gt;&gt; which imply prime-factors 7, 11, and 13.  He states even there<br/>&gt;&gt; that &quot;a future time&quot; may permit use of 3 and 5 along with the<br/>&gt;&gt; higher primes, but that during those early days he and his<br/>&gt;&gt; students wanted to concentrate on using the higher primes.</p><p>So the goal was *simultaneously* to AVOID 3- and 5-limit harmonic<br/>structures and to EMPHASIZE 7-, 11-, and (later) 13-limit ones.</p><p>In other words, in Schoenberg&apos;s expanded view of tonality (i.e.,<br/>11- or 13-limit, as opposed to the 5-limit view of traditional<br/>harmony textbooks), the already-familiar aspects of tonality<br/>were to be avoided, but the new and as-yet-unexplored ones were<br/>to be employed with abandon.</p><p>I think the misunderstanding of this idea is precisely at the root<br/>of all the misguided attempts to &quot;debunk&quot; Schoenberg&apos;s harmonic<br/>theory, as with William Thomson, Brian McLaren, etc.  Schoenberg<br/>sometimes spoke in terms of a higher-limit tonality in which<br/>the 5 non-diatonic notes of the 12-EDO scale were to be taken<br/>as high-prime tonality identites, and sometimes in terms of<br/>traditional tonality in which the 5 non-diatonic notes were<br/>considered &quot;non-harmonic tones&quot; or &quot;atonal notes&quot;.  Thus, in<br/>the first case these notes were &quot;more remote consonances&quot; and<br/>in the second case they were &quot;dissonances&quot;, but Schoenberg uses<br/>the concepts and the terms interchangeably, whereas in the<br/>standard view of harmony consonances and dissonances are total<br/>opposites.</p><p>From my point of view, Schoenberg&apos;s conception is entirely<br/>comprehensible, because he saw his theory as growing out of<br/>the practice of the German musical masters before him, and<br/>that&apos;s also exactly how he taught it.  So to learn the older<br/>conception -- that is, 5-limit-JI/meantone-based -- it was<br/>necessary to begin by treating the 5 non-diatonic pitches<br/>as &quot;dissonances&quot;, then to evolve toward Schoenberg&apos;s newer<br/>conception of the 12-EDO pitch-universe, a shift had to be<br/>made, and those pitches now viewed as &quot;more remote consonances&quot;,<br/>which in today&apos;s tuning theory we&apos;d call higher-limit identities.</p><p>So the business about &quot;reminiscences of tonality&quot; in Schoenberg,<br/>Berg, and Webern boils down to this:  Berg enthusiastically<br/>embraced the possibilities of weaving 5-limit-based harmony<br/>into his serial (i.e., implied-13-limit) work, Schoenberg enjoyed<br/>having the freedom to &quot;regress&quot; back to 5-limit when he wanted to,<br/>and Webern studiously avoided 5-limit forever after adopting<br/>pantonality (or atonality, if it must be referred to as that),<br/>even before he copped Schoenberg&apos;s serial method in the 1920s.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32343 href="#32343">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2002 7:54:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; How many<br/>&gt; different ways could one imagine &quot;octave equivalence&quot;<br/>&gt; to be interpreted?</p><p>About a hundred.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps - &quot;equivalence of octaves&quot;?</p><p>That suggests a few.</p></div><h3><a id=32345 href="#32345">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2002 8:00:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hmmm ... this is very similar to the way I understand Erv Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt; theories of harmonic structures of Combination Product Sets.<br/>&gt; They are centerless, and thus in a sense could be called atonal,<br/>&gt; but made entirely of the most consonant ratios within whatever<br/>&gt; given prime-limits, thus simultaneously implying ever-shifting<br/>&gt; tonalities all the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (or are they odd-limits?

Take a look in the &quot;13-limit&quot; section, just after<br/>&gt; &gt; Partch and the 11-limit.  Almost that entire section is taken<br/>&gt; &gt; up with a disussion of Schoenberg.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ******I reviewed your comments in this section.  However, you say<br/>&gt; yourself here on page 123:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;.... he [Schoenberg] has reverted to the old-fashioned way of<br/>&gt; thinking of dissonances as being *not* related to the &quot;key,&quot; but as<br/>&gt; being foreign, in the sense that these &quot;dissonant&quot; tones actually<br/>&gt; belong to other fundamentals, because composing in this &quot;atonal&quot; style<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;...renounces a tonal centre... avoiding the establishment of a<br/>&gt; key...&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;If Schoenberg had been willing to LISTEN to his theoretical ideas on<br/>&gt; just-tuned instruments, he may not have made that paradoxical<br/>&gt; statement.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ******So, essentially, Monz, you are saying that the notion<br/>&gt; of &quot;dissonance&quot; or &quot;avoidance&quot; of tonality is an &quot;old fashioned&quot; way<br/>&gt; of looking a things, rather than using your new concept &quot;sonance.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems more to reinforce my *own* argument that &quot;nothing is<br/>&gt; avoided&quot; that I have commented on previously...</p><p>Well, what I wrote there doesn&apos;t come across as well as I could<br/>probably say it now.</p><p>I was trying to show that &quot;my new&quot; concept of &quot;sonance&quot; was<br/>really the same as Schoenberg&apos;s, which was also the same as<br/>Partch&apos;s, but that neither of them ever took the step of simply<br/>chucking the two prefixes which designate the relativity<br/>aspect (the poles of &quot;con-&quot; and &quot;dis-&quot;) and keeping only the<br/>essential root of the term (= &quot;sonance&quot;) to express the totality<br/>of the continuum itself.</p><p>Keeping the polarity in their terminology made it<br/>more difficult for both of them to express the wholistic<br/>sense of a continuum of sonance, and thus of feeling,<br/>divided into infinitely many shades between the poles.<br/>When presented with terminology which emphazises polar<br/>opposites, it&apos;s only natural that a reader would tend to<br/>see it as a dualistic rather than a wholistic issue.</p><p>Partch established specificity by exclusive use of<br/>ratio numbers.  He defined specific shades of consonance<br/>(see &quot;The One-Footed Bride&quot; in _Genesis_) as a function<br/>of the odd-limit of the ratios in an interval.</p><p>But Schoenberg was *much* more vague, and as a result,<br/>his explanation of sonance is much more difficult to follow;<br/>thus the ambiguity and richness of variety with which<br/>posterity has interpreted his theories.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Schoenberg, _Harmonielehre_ p 20, Carter trans. p 21]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Now if I continue to use the expressions &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; and &quot;dissonance&quot;, even though they are unwarranted,<br/>&gt;&gt; I do so because there are signs that the evolution<br/>&gt;&gt; of harmony will, in a short time, prove the inadquacy<br/>&gt;&gt; of this classification.  The introduction of another<br/>&gt;&gt; terminology at this stage would have no purpose and could<br/>&gt;&gt; hope for little success. Since I still have to operate<br/>&gt;&gt; with these notions, I will define consonances as... &lt;etc.&gt;</p><p>I would have strongly argued with Schoenberg about that,<br/>pointing out as I did above that rather than introduce *new*<br/>terminology, all that was necessary was to *simplify* the<br/>existing terminology, but with such a powerful simplification<br/>that it could change the metaphysical basis of the reader&apos;s<br/>entire harmonic conception, so that it would come closer to<br/>matching that of Schoenberg himself.  If there was ever an<br/>example of a missed opportunity in music-history, that was<br/>one of them! (IMO)</p><p>As I&apos;ve been pointing out here, Schoenberg understood<br/>enough about tuning theory to know that previous theorists<br/>(and primarily Schenker, who was his contemporary) had<br/>pretty much assessed 5 as the odd- or prime-limit on<br/>*consonant* harmonic ratios.  And he also knew that in the<br/>expression of harmonic ideas in his own music he was reaching<br/>out to encompass intervals that he considered consonant<br/>which contained prime-factors of 7 and 11 (and by 1934,<br/>also 13).</p><p>In &quot;Twelve Tone Composition&quot;, a previously unpublished paper<br/>from 1923 [_Style and Idea_, p 207], Schoenberg begins:</p><p>&gt;&gt; In twelve-tone composition consonances (major and minor<br/>&gt;&gt; triads) and also the simpler dissonances (diminished<br/>&gt;&gt; triads and seventh chords) -- in fact almost everything<br/>&gt;&gt; that used to make up the ebb and flow of harmony -- are,<br/>&gt;&gt; as far as possible, avoided.</p><p>There&apos;s that magic word, Joe!</p><p>The next sentence is one of those great examples of how<br/>Schoenberg sabotoges the clarity of his own thought by<br/>presenting so many parenthetical commentaries:</p><p>&gt;&gt; But this is not because of any natural law of the new<br/>&gt;&gt; art.  It is, presumably, just one manifestation of a<br/>&gt;&gt; reaction, one that does not have its own special causes<br/>&gt;&gt; but derives from another manifestation -- which it tries<br/>&gt;&gt; to contradict, and whose laws are therefore the same,<br/>&gt;&gt; basically, as its own.</p><p>This does, however, set up his next point:</p><p>&gt;&gt; At the root of all this is the unconscious urge to try<br/>&gt;&gt; out the new resources independently, to wrest from them<br/>&gt;&gt; possibilities of constructing forms, to produce with them<br/>&gt;&gt; *alone* [emphasis Monzo&apos;s] all the effects of a clear style,<br/>&gt;&gt; of a compact, lucid and comprehensive presentation of the<br/>&gt;&gt; musical idea.  To use here the old resources in the old<br/>&gt;&gt; sense saves trouble -- the trouble of cultivating the new<br/>&gt;&gt; -- but also means passing up the chance of enjoying whatever<br/>&gt;&gt; can *only* [emphasis Schoenberg&apos;s] be attained by new<br/>&gt;&gt; resources when the old ones are excluded!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A later time will perhaps be allowed to use both kinds of<br/>&gt;&gt; resources in the same way, one alongside the other, ...</p><p>So here Schoenberg clearly states that the &quot;old-fashioned&quot;<br/>compositional practices are to be avoided, so that the<br/>new ones could be explored *exclusively*.</p><p>My interpretation of this is that Schoenberg sought a type<br/>of 7-/11-/13-limit harmony which excluded the familiar 3-<br/>and 5-limit relationships.</p><p>Schoenberg used the overtone-theory as a way to link between<br/>his own practical experience of hearing overtones in<br/>instrumental sounds, and the little that he understood of the<br/>mathematics of tuning theory.  It is what enabled Gene and<br/>I to construct the periodicity-blocks describing the JI-based<br/>aspect of Schoenberg&apos;s theory.</p><p>Schoenberg&apos;s statements can be followed logically to suggest<br/>that he is saying that in the &quot;atonal&quot; music composed by he<br/>and his students during the 1910s-20s, their intention was<br/>to avoid the implication of 3- and 5-limit harmonies and<br/>make full use of the implication of 7-, 11-, and 13-limit<br/>harmonies, which are available within the periodicity-blocks<br/>which may be constructed from Schoenberg&apos;s explanation of<br/>the 12-EDO scale.
