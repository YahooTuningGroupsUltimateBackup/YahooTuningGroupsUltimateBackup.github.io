PATRICK GRANT BACK INTO STUDIO TO RECORD TWO NEW CDS</p><p>I*, and members of the Patrick Grant Group, began tracking sessions on<br/>19 July for what will become two new CDs scheduled for Fall 2000 and<br/>Winter 2001 release.</p><p>Tracks being recorded are:</p><p>&quot;Music for an Imaginary Horror Film&quot;<br/>[17&apos;]<br/>(fl., cl., bsn., tb., e.gtr., 2 perc., theremin, soprano, 3 synth.,<br/>va., vc, &amp; e.bass)<br/>Werkmeister III tuning</p><p>&quot;Influx&quot;<br/>[21&apos;]<br/>(fl., cl., tb., 2 perc., 3 synth.,  va., vc, &amp; e.bass)<br/>just intonation</p><p>&quot;5&Oslash;USA: 10 Marches and 50 Variations&quot;<br/>[25&apos;]<br/>(4 synth. &amp; perc.)<br/>just intonation</p><p>&quot;Keeping Still&quot;<br/>[4&apos;]<br/>(4 perc., &amp; piano)<br/>polymicrotonal</p><p>&quot;StepTime&quot;<br/>[7&apos;]<br/>(2 e.gtr., 4 synth. &amp; perc.)<br/>just intonation</p><p>&quot;tHE wEIGHTS oF nUMBERS - pART 1&quot;<br/>[9&apos;]<br/>(4 synth. &amp; perc.)<br/>just intonation</p><p>&quot;tHE wEIGHTS oF nUMBERS - pART 2&quot;<br/>[6&apos;]<br/>(4 synth. &amp; perc.)<br/>just intonation</p><p>&quot;Marblehead&quot;<br/>[9&apos;]<br/>(gamelan &amp; perc.)<br/>slendro and pelog tuning</p><p>&quot;Puzzle Dust&quot;<br/>[7&apos;]<br/>keyboard solo<br/>multiple just intonation</p><p>... and other titles TBA</p><p>As a preview of the first of these two CDs, and, in time for Halloween<br/>2000, a CD single of &quot;Music for an Imaginary Horror Film&quot; will be<br/>released early October.</p><p>As of this release, the participating artists include, Marija Ilic:<br/>keyboards, John Ferrari: percussion, Darryl Gregory: trombone, Thomas P.<br/>Oberle: clarinet / bass clarinet, Johnny Reinhard: bassoon, Joshua<br/>Pierce: keyboards. Other artists TBA.</p><p>The recording is being done on a combination of interfaced software and<br/>hardware made by DigiDesign, Cubase, Cakewalk, Roland, and E Magic Logic<br/>Audio at sTRANGEmUSIC&apos;s newly constructed project studio at 200 E 65<br/>Street.</p><p>No, I&apos;m not a paid spokesperson for the above companies (in fact many of<br/>you may know of my wont to &quot;blank out&quot; corporate logos) but, I do find<br/>it interesting that, despite the current trend and &quot;holy grail&quot; of the<br/>hard-wired-everything-in-a-box aesthetic, that we&apos;re getting excellent<br/>results just by synching everything up (via SMPTE, MIDI, and MMC) and truly<br/>customizing it to our purposes. Whaddya know ... it works! At this<br/>point, if they made pin-stripes and tail-fins for computers, I&apos;d<br/>probably get them too.</p><p>All tracking and editing will be done in-house. Mixing and<br/>mastering will be done with a producer at a studio TBA. (surprise-surprise).</p><p>Refer to item #3 for updates.</p><p>(* I&apos;m done with referring to this guy&apos;s work in the third person.)</p><p>2. SCOTLAND TRIP IN AUGUST FOR MUSICOLOGICAL RESEARCH</p><p>I&apos;ll will be traveling to Grantown-on-Spey, Inverness, Scotland, from<br/>August 10 through 17. The purpose of this trip is a combination of<br/>participating in the Millennial Gathering of Clan Grant (yeah, I&apos;ll be<br/>doing the kilt-thing) and of doing musicological research of highland<br/>folk music and its tunings (intervals in relation to the drone ... at<br/>least). I&apos;ve never been much into the &quot;identity politick&quot; thing but, I<br/>guess for me, this is Mecca and I should make the<br/>one-trip-in-my-lifetime. Plus, I must say, I do look pretty convincing<br/>in my clan&apos;s tartan.</p><p>Since I&apos;ve always made a lousy tourist, be it Bali or Baltimore, I feel<br/>more credible if I can dig (sic) into whatever indigenous musical scene<br/>is existing. I&apos;ll use this opportunity to rectify whatever ill feelngs<br/>that I may have had towards the bagpipes, bodhrains, etc. and make contact<br/>with the local artists, record stuff on my portable DAT, and ask a lot of<br/>uninteresting questions.</p><p>Hopefully, this work will be fruitful because I&apos;m already scheduled to<br/>have it manifest in the new piece &quot;The Rock of Alarm (Craigellachie!)&quot;<br/>to be premiered at the American Festival of Microtonal Music&apos;s Microthon<br/>2000 at the Quaker Meeting House in NYC on November 11.</p><p>The title refers to my clan&apos;s family motto (&quot;Stand Fast&quot;) and even more<br/>so to the precipice upon which Castle Grant at Loch Ness sits.<br/>Sometimes, I love a good title as a creative port-of-entry, and, I feel<br/>that this one will work for me in that the double entendre of &quot;rock&quot;<br/>says a lot about my generation&apos;s preference of a kick-and-snare backbeat<br/>(although it will probably be deconstructed into a 5- or 7-feel, as I&apos;m<br/>oft to do) over the jazzier ride-cymbal-propulsion of earlier<br/>contemporary musical language. If you know what I mean, then you know<br/>what I mean. Otherwise, please come to the performance.</p><p>This work will be scored for 2 microtunable synthesizers and percussion<br/>will be performed by myself, Marija Ilic, and John Ferrari.</p><p>More info on the AFMM and the Microthon 2000 TBA in the Fall.</p><p>3. <a href="http://sTRANGEmUSIC.cOM">sTRANGEmUSIC.cOM</a> - WEBSITE GOING UP - Fall 2000</p><p>Yep. I&apos;ve succumbed. After two years of unethically keeping a<br/>domain-sans-content (believe-or-don&apos;t, I&apos;ve had numerous requests to<br/>transfer that name), I&apos;ll be going legit and posting pages that will<br/>serve as the future primary info source for my music, recordings, and<br/>performances. You name it, I&apos;ll be posting it. Text, photos, MIDIs,<br/>MP3s, etc. etc. etc.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ll keep it on-topic and promise NOT to include JPEGs of my pets<br/>(AKA the politically-correct &quot;companion animals&quot;), favorite films, et al, and<br/>concentrate<br/>on music: my music, and links to musician/composer colleagues who I find<br/>to be and have been a source of inspiration within our<br/>corner-of-any-said-scene here<br/>in NYC.</p><p>News regarding the upcoming CD releases will be posted here as well.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Need it be said, that, despite any perceived &quot;sense-of-humor&quot; found above<br/>(can&apos;t stomach those pretentious or heavy-heavy-heavy (heavy-heavy)<br/>announcements meself):</p><p>(N)ew (M)usic is a serious business.</p><p>So ... let&apos;s hear it for ephemeral air-sculpture in spacetime ...</p><p>I say yeah,</p><p>PG<br/>NYC<br/>Summer 2000</p><p>+++++++++++++++++</p><p>sTRANGEmUSIC iNC.<br/>200 E 65 Street<br/>Floor 41<br/>New York, NY 10021</p><p>&quot;How&apos;s My Driving?&quot; c/o <a href="mailto:info@sTRANGEmUSIC.cOM">info@sTRANGEmUSIC.cOM</a></p></div>
