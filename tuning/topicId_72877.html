However, I can think of half a dozen other<br/>(non-genetic) reasons why one might find such a distribution with<br/>their survey methods. For example people with mediocre pitch<br/>recognition might be more reluctant to take the survey than either<br/>those with accurate AP or with none at all.

The problem is that they have<br/>no control at all over the consistency of sampling.</p><p>What they wanted to find is the distribution of AP ability. (Over what<br/>population exactly?...) What they have is this distribution, times a<br/>function which encodes the desire, ability and opportunity of people<br/>to take the online test within the survey period. Without knowing<br/>something about this second function, the actual distribution of<br/>ability is, to say the least, uncertain.</p><p>~~~T~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0703868104v3">http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0703868104v3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not the genetic bit, just the survey data.
