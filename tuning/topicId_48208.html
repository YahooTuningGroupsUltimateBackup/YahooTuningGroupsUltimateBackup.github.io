It<br/>is packed with historical scales, and almost every possible tool for studying<br/>them, including beat rates, etc. So you should be able to lay a bearing for<br/>Young from that.....</p><p>briefly, Vallotti/Young is 6 pure fifths and then distributing the remaining<br/>pythagorean comma around the other 6. It&apos;s a common tuning enough, and in the<br/>public eye, but there are better ones from the period...my favorite, after<br/>reading a paper by Paul Poletti regarding it, and tuning it on my keyboard<br/>here, would be Neidhardt I. (try IIand III as well (neidhardt IV is<br/>12-tet!!!!)) They are a welcome change from the &apos;only three anyone knows&apos;<br/>syndrom of Werckmeister, Kirnberger, V/Young......Poletti also makes case for<br/>the Sorge tunings.</p><p>Yes, &apos;romantics&apos; sound great in these tunings, very colorful, as do the<br/>baroque and classical composers...it&apos;s a simple argument really...12-tet was<br/>not really a stong keyboard standard when most of them wrote, so they didn&apos;t<br/>use it themselves...these tunings open up new levels of harmonic meaning when<br/>they are used for the &apos;romantics&apos; (I dislike the label &apos;romanticism&apos;, and<br/>prefer &apos;19th century music&apos;)</p><p>If you&apos;re interested, here&apos;s the Poletti link:</p><p><a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/paulpoletti/T4D.PDF">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/paulpoletti/T4D.PDF</a></p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=48229 href="#48229">ðŸ”—</a>a440a@aol.com</h3><span>10/27/2003 10:02:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Andrew asks:<br/>&lt;&lt;  Hi, I&apos;m a piano tuner interested in historical temperaments (unsatisfied</p><p>&gt; with the equal temperament I was taught).

I have a lot to study.  Temperament history, the why&apos;s and how&apos;s were not taught in my course work.  I&apos;m still working at understanding the lingo utilized here.  I do utilize an ETD (Peterson 490ST) to assist in my work (especially helpful for old spinets and short cheap grands and bad jumps in scaling) and it had several built in &quot;historic&quot; temperaments.  I&apos;ve learned to be doubtful of the tuner and needed somewhere to turn to find aural checks etc.  This I have found and much more.<br/>I did tune the piano (a cheap short grand) to Young and my wife liked it.  &quot;...has some brighter chords.&quot;<br/>Someone suggested Niedhart for Chopin.  Which of his proposed tunings might that be.  I&apos;ve encountered various nomenclature for his work.  He did propose ET for the royal court tunings.  I have been reading Poletti&apos;s work on this and am most familiar with his nomenclature right now.  I&apos;m curious what  tuning methods might have been prevalent, regionally etc., with various composers.</p><p>Thanks again,<br/>Andrew</p></div><h3><a id=48246 href="#48246">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/28/2003 7:01:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Andrew, one interesting things about well-temperaments:  The<br/>well-temperaments sound more alike to each other than they do to equal temperament.  Part of<br/>the reasons is that the most overtone related key is C major.  All the<br/>temperaments start from C.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
