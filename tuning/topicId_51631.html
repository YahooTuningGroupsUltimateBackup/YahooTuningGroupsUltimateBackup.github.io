First, Bill apparently went to Charles<br/>Lucy to explain the connection of his &quot;Law&quot; to harmony. The description<br/>used musical notation, starting with the lowest frequency (C1) to<br/>correspond to the radius of Mercury&apos;s orbit, with higher octaves (C2,<br/>C3, etc.) extending out to Pluto&apos;s orbit, plus two fifths above the<br/>tonic (G) to fit the cases that don&apos;t line up.</p><p>Well, all waves, not just standing waves, obey the relation that<br/>frequency times wavelength equals the speed of propagation. This means<br/>that the longest standing wave node (Pluto) should have the lowest<br/>frequency, not the highest. The shortest standing wave node (Mercury)<br/>should have the highest frequency. Since the pattern described has this<br/>exactly backwards, there is absolutely no way this particular pattern<br/>can have anything to do with reality. The fact that Bill did not notice<br/>this perfect backwardness in Lucy&apos;s explanation is consistent with his<br/>thinking that a trade school text from 1950 on elementary electric<br/>circuits contains fundamental laws of physics.</p><p>So, I think what they should have been trying to say, was that Pluto&apos;s<br/>orbit should be considered as C1 and the two planets (Earth and<br/>Neptune)<br/>that did not fit as doublings were thirds above the tonic, rather than<br/>fifths. A third above is the same interval as a fifth below. Otherwise,<br/>the pattern is completely backward. We still have the problem that the<br/>series for the inner planets does not match that for the outer planets.<br/>They are still very much &quot;out of tune&quot; with each other.</p><p>Although this alternative has the lowest frequency properly associated<br/>with the longest wavelength, and vice versa, it brings us to my second<br/>comment on such patterns, namely that if you consider octaves, thirds,<br/>and fifths on the musical scale, you basically have half the notes of a<br/>major scale available for picking and choosing. That&apos;s 32 possible<br/>parameters for nine planets plus the asteroid belt. In this case they<br/>also used two different tonics, one for the inner planets and one for<br/>the outer, effectively doubling the number of possible parameters to<br/>64.</p><p>Unless there is a planet associated with each and every one of these 64<br/>&quot;notes,&quot; it suggests you simply have too many free parameters (more<br/>than<br/>six to one) for a fair test. As we like to tease the theorists, &quot;Given<br/>enough free parameters you can fit any theory to any data.&quot;</p><p>Bill<br/>Author of Arnold&apos;s Law</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
