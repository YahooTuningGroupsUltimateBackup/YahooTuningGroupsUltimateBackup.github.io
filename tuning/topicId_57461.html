One way<br/>to describe what that means is that you can take the centroid, or<br/>center point, of the eikosany, which is |0 3/2 1/2 1/2 1/2&gt;, and draw<br/>an ellipsoidal region around it which contains all of the notes of the<br/>eikosany and no other notes. This was my project for the day and it<br/>would be interesting to find a less laborious way of determining what<br/>is, and what is not, a scale of ball type.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.2 - Release Date: 11/3/05</p></div>
