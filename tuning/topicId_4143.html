<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>The world according to Rothenberg (re Kraig Grady)</h1><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/1999 9:00:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I appreciate you going through all this as I have never seen Rothenberg<br/>&gt;work. I seem to be missing somerthing as I don&apos;t see where any thing like<br/>&gt;MOS is spelt out. It seems to be barely implied.</p><p>Rothenberg&apos;s theory does not address MOS as such.  However, I do believe<br/>that MOS can be explained with only Rothenberg&apos;s model plus extended<br/>reference.  That is, if we take Rothenberg and extended reference to be our<br/>requirements for human melodic enjoyment, then MOS shouldn&apos;t miss many good<br/>scales.  I doubt tetrachordality produces significantly different results<br/>here, provided we don&apos;t take the &quot;tetra&quot; literally, and that we don&apos;t<br/>insist on 3/2&apos;s or fifths (that is, we consider tetrachordality of the<br/>generator).</p><p>&gt;What are musical application of anything having to do with equivalence<br/>&gt;classes</p><p>This is arguably the most useful part of the model.  It predicts that<br/>different scales can sometimes sound like re-tunings of eachother.<br/>Actually, it predicts when this will be the case.  How well does it work?<br/>This is one of the most important parts of the model to test, and<br/>Rothenberg has designed ingenious experiments to test it.  In the 60&apos;s he<br/>commissioned Moog to built him a microtonal synth for the experiments, but<br/>Moog&apos;s design was a dud, the air-force decided to pull funding, and the<br/>experiments are unperformed to this day.</p><p>However, Rothenberg claims to have achieved good results with<br/>ethno-musicology.  Apparently, many of the instruments in the Indonesian<br/>gamelan change their timbre as they age, and the gamelan is periodically<br/>re-tuned to accommodate this.  Eventually there is a point at which,<br/>suddenly, the basic scale seems to have changed.  Rothenberg claims this is<br/>the point where the equivalence class has changed.</p><p>&gt;or what is gain by the labeling scales proper and improper.</p><p>The difference is in how they tend to be used.  Improper scales are usually<br/>sectioned into principle and ornamental tones, the tonic is often kept by<br/>some device like a drone, or is static, and composition is much less likely<br/>to use modal transposition of themes.  Instead, rhythms trace out the<br/>boundaries of the principle tones, and the principle/ornamental sectioning<br/>can be changed on the fly.</p><p>If a scale is proper, a melody can be played in any mode of the scale and<br/>it will still be recognized as the same melody.  Scale degree fun may or<br/>may not be used, depending on the efficiency (see below).</p><p>&gt;I really don&apos;t know what to do with<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;n!<br/>&gt;&gt;Sigma(S_i) / n!<br/>&gt;&gt;i=1<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;F(P) may be interpreted as the average number of elements in a non-<br/>&gt;&gt;repeating sequence of n elements of P(x) required to determine the<br/>&gt;&gt;key, x.  Efficiency, E, is defined as F(P)/n and Redundancy, R, as<br/>&gt;&gt;1 - F(P)/n.  Both numbers lie between 0 and 1.</p><p>If my language here is accurate, Sigma represents a function which sums the<br/>values of one variable as another is varied over some range, which is given<br/>above and below the Sigma sign (which I couldn&apos;t figure out how to do in<br/>ASCI).</p><p>In this case, we are considering all non-repeating strings of tones<br/>possible (what is called a peal in change ringing, I believe) in a scale<br/>with n tones per octave (there are n! of them).  Imagine I play one for<br/>you, starting on some random frequency.  Your job is to shout &quot;stop!&quot; as<br/>soon as you can name the tonic frequency.  When you yell stop, I stop, and<br/>the number of tones you heard that far is called S_i (the &quot;i&quot; subscript<br/>tells which string the number S_i came from -- since there are n! possible<br/>strings, we vary the &quot;i&quot; from 1 to n!).  Now suppose you want to find the<br/>average number of tones you had to hear for all strings.  You&apos;d sum them<br/>all up (Sigma) and divide by the total number of strings (n!).</p><p>That&apos;s the equation.  Efficiency is actually the answer of that equation<br/>divided by n.  So if you have a scale with 22 tones per octave, and the<br/>average number of tones you need to hear to identify the key is 3, you&apos;ve<br/>got 19 tones that aren&apos;t doing anything to help you identify the key, which<br/>means low efficiency.</p><p>The important thing about efficiency is that it measures the difficulty of<br/>finding the tonic in a segment of music.  For improper scales, where scale<br/>degrees (and therefore the whereabouts of the tonic) is all-important,<br/>efficiency must be low.  For proper scales, efficiency can be high or low,<br/>but it may be better high (Paul, do you think your preference for the<br/>pentachordal decatonics can be explained by the lower efficiency of the<br/>symmetric ones?).</p><p>Does that help?  Comments, corrections (as always, it should go without<br/>saying) wanted.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/1999 12:17:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl!<br/>    Thanks for doing this. comments below if I am correct!</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>So equivalence could be found on the scale tree as the range between<br/>different  factors on the same level .<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/scaletree.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/scaletree.html</a>  example-so a scale that could be<br/>defined as a 3/7 scale would be equivalent. with the limits being those<br/>defined as 3/8 and 4/7.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What are musical application of anything having to do with equivalence<br/>&gt; &gt;classes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is arguably the most useful part of the model.

Examples please.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t completely clear here, sorry. First of all the scale tree is not limited<br/>to log. It can also be used acoustically. But lets look at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/key.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/key.html</a> . the keyboard designs. Those scales that would<br/>fit on the 3/7 keyboard would be equivalent if carried out to the same number of<br/>places. This would include Contant Structures. A simpler example would be<br/>Centaur, which is a 12-tone tuning which fits over a 12 tone keyboard. This<br/>scale, I am asuming would be eqiuvalent to 12et in that one could sound as a<br/>retuning of the other. Anyway those scales that would fall on a 3/8 keyboard<br/>would not be equivalent because of the underlying structure. By limits, I mean<br/>the scales that are contained beneath and included below lets say 3/7 as opposed<br/>to 3/8. Going back to the 5/12 scales (12ET or centuar) and look at the scale<br/>tree section that contains them  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/ST07.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/ST07.html</a> . The scales<br/>below will all contain 12 substets that I believe would fall under Rothenberg<br/>equivalence? Maybe Chamers can help us here</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Are not the improper scales 2nd level MOS and proper 1st level?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Proper scales are not necessarily MOS, and MOS scales are not necessarily<br/>&gt; proper (take the recent 11-tone chain-of-minor-thirds scale, for example).</p><p>I believe it is an MOS!
