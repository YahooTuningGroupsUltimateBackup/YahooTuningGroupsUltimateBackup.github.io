Use the dropbox instead if you want to share your demos. Ask Francois on this list if you need help.<br/>Last sunday I &quot;D-Jayed&quot; 30 of the demos sent in an ambient festival (Ambiosonic 18-20 June Collobrieres France) and they were really well received. People even danced on some of them and it was a pleasure to hear it out in nature on big &quot;boom-boom&quot; speakers.

If I get enough answers to be representative, this would allow us to determine an additional &quot;Alternate Tuning List&quot; prize, which would be valorizing to mention on the MOTU website when we get there, and wherever else.<br/>A quick online low-resolution survey of the demos (for those deposed) can be done from the dropbox.  Some of the candidates did not upload their demos in their folders but I am doing it myself right now.</p><p>I also asked the candidates to tell us the most important of their demos for them (this won&apos;t be published, but it would possibly help us us to cite, in case, the most relevant piece(s) for each composer).</p><p>Cheers,<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>Chris wrote :</p><p>&gt; Jacques,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see on xenharmonic alliance you wrote the entry date ends July &gt; 23rd, yet<br/>&gt; here you say 18th July.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there something I missed?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had half a mind to add another piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris</p><p>(updated copy of my message) :</p><p>This is to let you know my internet line has been repaired a few days ago.<br/>I am able to read the wonderful tuning list messages again -<br/>and hear the last Ethno demos (surprising works !) :<br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9grkajrdg7uo6ds">https://www.dropbox.com/s/9grkajrdg7uo6ds</a></p><p>And to share with you the totality now of my own 3 Ethno demos -<br/>You can hear and read about them at<br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ay9ktuh93lcunxo">https://www.dropbox.com/s/ay9ktuh93lcunxo</a><br/>I am glad, even if an amateur on that type of instrument, that I could finalize this test<br/>and could gain to keep my own software !</p><p>So, Ethno2 microtonal demo competition has arrived at its end yesterday.<br/>Again, my thanks to all the participants !<br/>The AEH Jury will now meet for the deliberation and the award ceremony FRIDAY evening 23nd of July at 18h30, and results should be published on this list this week-end.<br/>Until then and even after the dropbox can receive the last demos and the last versions.<br/>Thanks to precise the tunings and write your presentation if it has not been done.</p><p>In the meantime anyone who wishes can send me - better offlist - a vote for a list of any number of titles presented by preference order (ex. with numbers 1 2 3 4 5...) and we will try to sort out of it an additionnal *Tuning List* prize.</p><p>Candidates themselves can also vote, by two special ways :<br/>- by sending the same kind of list (their own titles won&apos;t be taken in account) ;<br/>- by saying what is their own prefered demo(s) according to them, if they have some.</p><p>Bye for now,<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>jacques.dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2010 6:26:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ethno2 Dropbox folders of Ozan Yarman, Jean-Pierre Poulin, Carlo Serafini completed :</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9grkajrdg7uo6ds">https://www.dropbox.com/s/9grkajrdg7uo6ds</a></p><p>Vote for the Prize of the Tuning List !</p><p>send your list (of any number of demos) at :</p><p>fotosonix@...</p></div>
