Hopefully Joe Monzo will have<br/>the complete archives up soon so anyone can look at how these discussions<br/>evolved. I would like first of all to summarize some important physical and<br/>psychophysical points, since these are not a matter of opinion as are the<br/>points of musical theory (although the latter has a long history with which<br/>I suggest Mr. Tomes begin to acquaint himself!)</p><p>First, subharmonics can be said to exist in natural sounds but the<br/>subharmonic series can&apos;t. When a musical tone is accompanied by a<br/>subharmonic, it is always a case of the subharmonic being the true<br/>fundamental, over which a certain subset of the partials is so prominent<br/>that one of the harmonics sounds like a fundamental. A true subharmonic<br/>series would imply two or more relatively prime undertones of the<br/>fundamental existing at the same time, and this does not occur in acoustic<br/>sounds. Note: one should not draw _any_ conclusions directly from this about<br/>the appropriateness of various chords in music. Music is a human construct,<br/>so it is necessary (but not sufficient) that all known psychoacoustics (how<br/>we perceive sound) _must_ be interposed between an analysis of sounds and<br/>prescriptions for musical theory. There is much of primary importance here<br/>that is being totally ignored in recent discussions (except Dave Keenan who<br/>has kindly repeated some of my points). I refer you to my old postings.</p><p>Second, beating and difference tones (&quot;ghost tones&quot;) are two completely<br/>different phenomena. It is totally incorrect to treat them as one and the<br/>same. (1) One is a rhythm and the other is a pitch. Although there are<br/>certainly circumstances where a physical stimulus with a certain fundamental<br/>frequency evokes both the pitch corresponding to that frequency and a rhythm<br/>at that frequency, there is absolutely no evidence that this is musically<br/>preferable to the hearing of a pitch corresponding to one frequency and a<br/>rhythm at another. Absolutely none. (2) Beating arises in the ear due to<br/>frequencies that are too close to be fully resolved -- so an average<br/>frequency is heard with an amplitude modulation at a rate equal to the<br/>difference between the frequencies (for a derivation of this, see, for<br/>example, the Feynman Lectures on Physics). This modulation rate can be<br/>within the (extreme lower part of the) range of audible frequencies but does<br/>not evoke the slightest hint of the pitch corresponding to that frequency.<br/>Difference tones arise due to non-linearities in the auditory system --<br/>another section of the Feynman lectures shows how, in the case of a<br/>quadratic (simplest possible) nonlinearity, two pitches will create the<br/>impression of six: the two pitches themselves, the difference tone, the sum<br/>tone, and the octave above each of the two original pitches. The human<br/>ear-brain system is more complex so additional combination tones, such as<br/>the difference between one tone and the octave above the other tone, are<br/>important. Note: the existence of such combination tones gives a hint as to<br/>one reason why otonal (harmonic-series based) chords are preferable to<br/>utonal (subharmonic-series based) chords. All the combination tones of one<br/>harmonic series belong to that same harmonic series, while the combination<br/>tones of a subharmonic series will tend to fall outside that series and<br/>densely fill frequency space.</p><p>Third, the relative masses of subatomic particles are neither integer ratios<br/>nor constants. They are functions of energy. The experiments which determine<br/>these ratios are designed, and their result interpreted, according to<br/>quantum theory. It is fallacious to take these results out of that context<br/>and interpret them according to a 19th century, classical mechanistic<br/>mindset. Of course, this mindset continues to be promulgated by virtually<br/>all academia and intelligensia (outside of physicists themselves and those<br/>who would try to draw connections with Eastern philosophies) so it is hardly<br/>surprising that this sort of thing goes on.</p><p>One musical point for Ray Tomes: You are incorrect in your assumptions about<br/>composers&apos; intentions and wandering tonics. Many classical pieces have been<br/>analyzed in just intonation and almost invariably they have a net downward<br/>drift in JI, sometimes by as much as half an octave. It is quite clear,<br/>though, that the musical effect of the pieces depends on them returning to<br/>the same actual pitch when the notation indicates a return to the home key<br/>(which it does in perhaps 99% of Baroque, Classical, and Romantic pieces).<br/>Although a solution involving a constant, upward, compensating drift could<br/>certainly help in many situtations, it is difficult to see any grounds on<br/>which this could be deemed preferable to the adaptive JI schemes that John<br/>A. deLaubenfels (sp?) and I discussed.</p><p>There is so much more to reply to, but I just can&apos;t do the time anymore. One<br/>point to Joe Monzo:</p><p>Your idea of tuning the ii chord in a major key as 27:32:40 is the worst<br/>tuning idea I&apos;ve heard in a long time. I think I speak for every composer<br/>who&apos;s used the ii chord in a major key since the existence of major keys<br/>(~400 years). In particular, composers in Mozart&apos;s time were fond of themes<br/>which were (modally) transposed up a step, in which case the ii chord<br/>functions a bit like the tonic of a temporary relative dorian. Actually, in<br/>classical harmonic theory, it is not the ii chord but the iii chord that is<br/>sometimes considered a non-functional triad in a major key and is often<br/>analysed as an altered chord of some sort. As I am fond of pointing out,<br/>your (and Schoenberg&apos;s) conception of the major scale has virtually no<br/>support in the entire history of music.</p></div><h3><a id=3140 href="#3140">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/1999 9:23:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wish to indicate my general agreement with Paul Erlich&apos;s excellent recent<br/>posting.

If the<br/>large playing ground idea is used (which shows what I called C and C-<br/>etc) then we are in agreement that the piece should end on C and not C--<br/>or some such if it started on C.  This can be achieved by keeping track<br/>of the CoG (centre of gravity) as we go along and not letting it get too<br/>far from the starting place.  This method will ensure that the &quot;breaks&quot;<br/>will happen at the most correct places where there is considerable<br/>ambiguity.  Of course this is easier to do well with the whole piece of<br/>music available than to do in real time where retrospect can play no<br/>part.</p><p>For example, in the big playing field ...</p><p>D--  A-   E-   B-   F#-  C#-  G#-  D#-  A#   E#   B#<br/>   F-   C-   G-   D-   A    E    B    F#   C#   G#   D#<br/>      Ab   Eb   Bb   F    C    G    D    A+   E+   B+<br/>    Fb   Cb   Gb   Db   Ab+  Eb+  Bb+  F+   C+   G+   D+</p><p>... if we have wandered from D to E to D- and E- we would not want to go<br/>to D-- but would have a bias built in to pull back to D- instead.  Maybe<br/>even the first time (E to D-) would have pulled back unless the music<br/>very powerfully made this move.  Paul, I&apos;m not sure that we can fully<br/>resolve this without worked examples.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
