I&apos;ve gone to the trouble of putting a few proportional-beating temperaments on my Scalatron and playing various chord progressions, which is a much better indication of how they&apos;ll work out in practice than listening to chords in isolation.</p><p>I was completely unaware that I was hearing a proportional-beating temperament the first time I played in one, back in the 1970&apos;s.  I had been trying to develop a 19-tone well-temperament over the previous several years, with two objectives: to get 5-limit triads with less error in the fifths, and to get better-sounding (major, minor, &amp; especially harmonic) seventh chords (which I believe are 19&apos;s greatest weakness).  At first I was making the largest 5ths around 5.4 cents (~1/4-comma meantone) on the near side of the 5th-circle, which made me very unhappy with the very narrow 5ths on the far side.  I later tried something closer to 19-equal, with the 5ths on the near side sized (6.341 cents narrow) making several of the diminished 4ths (C#-F, G#-C, D#-G, A#-D, E#-A) an exact 7:9, which results in more convincing harmonic 7th chords.  I was pleasantly surprised that the triads (major, minor, &amp; subminor) sounded much more like those of 31-equal than of 19-equal, besides having a &quot;singing&quot; quality.  It wasn&apos;t until a few years ago that I learned that the chain of 5ths in the near side of this well-temperament is very close to Erv Wilson&apos;s meta-meantone temperament (5ths 6.325 cents narrow), which gives 1:1:1 (5th:M3,m3) synchronous beat rates in root-position major triads, which accounts for the &quot;singing&quot; quality of my well-temperament.  (I have since modified my well-temperament so that the best 5ths are exact meta-meantone, which, for all practical purposes, makes no audible difference.)  Another thing that really sets this temperament apart from both 19-equal &amp; 31-equal is that both the M3 &amp; m3 are slow-beating.  (Another plus: since some of the diminished 4ths are almost exactly 7:9, the 6:7:9 triads that contain these are very close to proportional-beating.)</p><p>Another temperament I tried on my Scalatron, more recently, is my 12-tone temperament (extra)ordinaire (12-TX), which now has the F, C, &amp; G root-position major triads with 1:1:4 (5th:M3,m3) synchronous beat rates.  These triads also seem to &quot;sing&quot;.  Although the minor 3rd is not slow-beating (as in 19-WT), the two slower-beating intervals (5th &amp; M3) tend to mask the faster-beating minor 3rd, so it is not as prominent.  Another thing that needs to be emphasized (again) is that, since both major &amp; minor triads are proportional-beating, the larger chords that combine them (M7, m7, M9, etc.) tend to avoid the &quot;janging&quot; effect of a conglomeration of unsynchronized beat rates.  This is something you can&apos;t fully appreciate until you sit down and play it on a keyboard.</p><p>&gt; One thing that should send up a red flag regarding brats -- and<br/>&gt; don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s an intoxicating pursuit for the scale<br/>&gt; theorist and I&apos;ve spent a pretty hour on it myself -- is their<br/>&gt; sensitivity to mistuning.  Is a brat of 1.4999 any good?  Where<br/>&gt; do you draw the line?  Of course we already encounter this<br/>&gt; problem with the tuning of simple ratios in harmony (harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy addresses it).</p><p>Of course, closely approximated brats (which is what I have on the Scalatron) are okay, just like near-JI is good.  In fact, you might prefer that to exact brats (just as I prefer the near-JI of a microtemperament to exact JI), because it mitigates a kind of &quot;antiseptic&quot; or synthetic quality in the sound.</p><p>&gt; This list has a poor memory, but I&apos;ve posted more than a few<br/>&gt; synthesized examples of chords with simple and not-so-simple<br/>&gt; brats.  Listeners seemed to prefer chords where the plain old<br/>&gt; tuning error was lower.  In fact, at least one person commented<br/>&gt; that the simple brats made beating worse, because its amplitude<br/>&gt; range is greater.

I&apos;ve gone to the trouble of putting a few proportional-beating<br/>&gt; temperaments on my Scalatron and playing various chord progressions,<br/>&gt; which is a much better indication of how they&apos;ll work out in<br/>&gt; practice than listening to chords in isolation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was completely unaware that I was hearing a proportional-beating<br/>&gt; temperament the first time I played in one, back in the 1970&apos;s.  I<br/>&gt; had been trying to develop a 19-tone well-temperament over the<br/>&gt; previous several years, with two objectives: to get 5-limit triads<br/>&gt; with less error in the fifths, and to get better-sounding (major,<br/>&gt; minor, &amp; especially harmonic) seventh chords (which I believe are<br/>&gt; 19&apos;s greatest weakness).  At first I was making the largest 5ths<br/>&gt; around 5.4 cents (~1/4-comma meantone) on the near side of the 5th-<br/>&gt; circle, which made me very unhappy with the very narrow 5ths on the<br/>&gt; far side.  I later tried something closer to 19-equal, with the 5ths<br/>&gt; on the near side sized (6.341 cents narrow) making several of the<br/>&gt; diminished 4ths (C#-F, G#-C, D#-G, A#-D, E#-A) an exact 7:9, which<br/>&gt; results in more convincing harmonic 7th chords.  I was pleasantly<br/>&gt; surprised that the triads (major, minor, &amp; subminor) sounded much<br/>&gt; more like those of 31-equal than of 19-equal, besides having a<br/>&gt; &quot;singing&quot; quality.  It wasn&apos;t until a few years ago that I learned<br/>&gt; that the chain of 5ths in the near side of this well-temperament is<br/>&gt; very close to Erv Wilson&apos;s meta-meantone temperament (5ths 6.325<br/>&gt; cents narrow), which gives 1:1:1 (5th:M3,m3) synchronous beat rates<br/>&gt; in root-position major triads, which accounts for the &quot;singing&quot;<br/>&gt; quality of my well-temperament.  (I have since modified my well-<br/>&gt; temperament so that the best 5ths are exact meta-meantone, which,<br/>&gt; for all practical purposes, makes no audible difference.)  Another<br/>&gt; thing that really sets this temperament apart from both 19-equal &amp;<br/>&gt; 31-equal is that both the M3 &amp; m3 are slow-beating.  (Another plus:<br/>&gt; since some of the diminished 4ths are almost exactly 7:9, the 6:7:9<br/>&gt; triads that contain these are very close to proportional-beating.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another temperament I tried on my Scalatron, more recently, is my 12-<br/>&gt; tone temperament (extra)ordinaire (12-TX), which now has the F, C, &amp;<br/>&gt; G root-position major triads with 1:1:4 (5th:M3,m3) synchronous beat<br/>&gt; rates.  These triads also seem to &quot;sing&quot;.  Although the minor 3rd is<br/>&gt; not slow-beating (as in 19-WT), the two slower-beating intervals<br/>&gt; (5th &amp; M3) tend to mask the faster-beating minor 3rd, so it is not<br/>&gt; as prominent.  Another thing that needs to be emphasized (again) is<br/>&gt; that, since both major &amp; minor triads are proportional-beating, the<br/>&gt; larger chords that combine them (M7, m7, M9, etc.) tend to avoid the<br/>&gt; &quot;janging&quot; effect of a conglomeration of unsynchronized beat rates.<br/>&gt; This is something you can&apos;t fully appreciate until you sit down and<br/>&gt; play it on a keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One thing that should send up a red flag regarding brats -- and<br/>&gt;&gt; don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s an intoxicating pursuit for the scale<br/>&gt;&gt; theorist and I&apos;ve spent a pretty hour on it myself -- is their<br/>&gt;&gt; sensitivity to mistuning.  Is a brat of 1.4999 any good?  Where<br/>&gt;&gt; do you draw the line?  Of course we already encounter this<br/>&gt;&gt; problem with the tuning of simple ratios in harmony (harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt; entropy addresses it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, closely approximated brats (which is what I have on the<br/>&gt; Scalatron) are okay, just like near-JI is good.  In fact, you might<br/>&gt; prefer that to exact brats (just as I prefer the near-JI of a<br/>&gt; microtemperament to exact JI), because it mitigates a kind of&gt; &quot;antiseptic&quot; or synthetic quality in the sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This list has a poor memory, but I&apos;ve posted more than a few<br/>&gt;&gt; synthesized examples of chords with simple and not-so-simple<br/>&gt;&gt; brats.  Listeners seemed to prefer chords where the plain old<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning error was lower.  In fact, at least one person commented<br/>&gt;&gt; that the simple brats made beating worse, because its amplitude<br/>&gt;&gt; range is greater.  Dave Keenan admitted he&apos;d been wrong about<br/>&gt;&gt; brats in one of those threads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I observed, a greater amplitude resulting from a 1:1 5th:M3 beat<br/>&gt; ratio has the advantage of masking the quicker beating of the minor<br/>&gt; 3rd, just as a vibrato masks the rapid beating of 3rds in 12-equal.<br/>&gt; So you can turn a &quot;flaw&quot; into a feature: if the beating is slow<br/>&gt; enough, it&apos;s a kind of vibrato, and if it&apos;s synched, then it&apos;ll sing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for wrong conclusions: in the past I subscribed to the idea that<br/>&gt; a 12-tone circulating temperament (a/k/a well-temperament) should<br/>&gt; have the combined error of the 5-limit consonances equal to the &gt; theoretical minimum -- thus no 5ths wider than just.

I think, for example, that it might sound<br/>amazing if an overdriven guitar were tuned to a scale like this. All<br/>of the nonlinearity going on would probably make a whole hierarchy of<br/>beating, so that a brat of 1.5 becomes brats of 1.5, 3, 4.5, and so<br/>on.

Your<br/>reasoning is fine there. It is identical to my assumption when I first<br/>heard of &quot;proportional beating&quot;.

If you take 440, 441, and 442 Hz, and you mix them all<br/>together, the same &quot;beating&quot; result is going to happen as if you took<br/>a 441 Hz constant sine wave playing through your speakers and turned<br/>the volume knob up and down sinusoidally, at a rate of once per<br/>second.</p><p>It&apos;s a pitch whose amplitude is being modulated... rhythmically. Think<br/>playing 16th notes on a vibraphone, except instead of the envelope<br/>being a bunch of sharp attacks and releases, it&apos;s a nice smooth<br/>sinusoidal pattern. Obviously the 16th notes on the vibraphone have<br/>both a pitched and rhythmic aspect to what&apos;s going on, as does all of<br/>music, and as does &quot;beating.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Just as phase is pretty much irrelevant in terms of pitch, it would clearly have to be pretty much irrelevant in terms of proportional beating were we to find that proportional beating is perceptible in cases with random phase occurrances.&nbsp; So, this rhythmic phenomenon- and&nbsp;beating is clearly rhythmic in the case of a lone dyad- would clearly be sharing a property of PITCH (insensitivity to phase).</p><p>Proportional beating will certainly be perceptible even if random<br/>phase occurances happen.

Whether it comes out to a perfect &quot;hot cup of tea&quot; or<br/>not, you&apos;re still going to, if you listen to the damn thing long<br/>enough, hear some kind of pattern that just keeps repeating.

I had been trying to develop a 19-tone well-temperament over the previous several years, with two objectives: to get 5-limit triads with less error in the fifths, and to get better-sounding (major, minor, &amp; especially harmonic) seventh chords (which I believe are 19&apos;s greatest weakness).  At first I was making the largest 5ths around 5.4 cents (~1/4-comma meantone) on the near side of the 5th-circle, which made me very unhappy with the very narrow 5ths on the far side.  I later tried something closer to 19-equal, with the 5ths on the near side sized (6.341 cents narrow) making several of the diminished 4ths (C#-F, G#-C, D#-G, A#-D, E#-A) an exact 7:9, which results in more convincing harmonic 7th chords.  I was pleasantly surprised that the triads (major, minor, &amp; subminor) sounded much more like those of 31-equal than of 19-equal, besides having a &quot;singing&quot; quality.  It wasn&apos;t until a few years ago that I learned that the chain of 5ths in the near side of this well-temperament is very close to Erv Wilson&apos;s meta-meantone temperament (5ths 6.325 cents narrow), which gives 1:1:1 (5th:M3,m3) synchronous beat rates in root-position major triads, which accounts for the &quot;singing&quot; quality of my well-temperament.  (I have since modified my well-temperament so that the best 5ths are exact meta-meantone, which, for all practical purposes, makes no audible difference.)  Another thing that really sets this temperament apart from both 19-equal &amp; 31-equal is that both the M3 &amp; m3 are slow-beating.  (Another plus: since some of the diminished 4ths are almost exactly 7:9, the 6:7:9 triads that contain these are very close to proportional-beating.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another temperament I tried on my Scalatron, more recently, is my 12-tone temperament (extra)ordinaire (12-TX), which now has the F, C, &amp; G root-position major triads with 1:1:4 (5th:M3,m3) synchronous beat rates.  These triads also seem to &quot;sing&quot;.  Although the minor 3rd is not slow-beating (as in 19-WT), the two slower-beating intervals (5th &amp; M3) tend to mask the faster-beating minor 3rd, so it is not as prominent.  Another thing that needs to be emphasized (again) is that, since both major &amp; minor triads are proportional-beating, the larger chords that combine them (M7, m7, M9, etc.) tend to avoid the &quot;janging&quot; effect of a conglomeration of unsynchronized beat rates.

Is a brat of 1.4999 any good?  Where<br/>&gt; &gt; do you draw the line?

In fact, you might prefer that to exact brats (just as I prefer the near-JI of a microtemperament to exact JI), because it mitigates a kind of &quot;antiseptic&quot; or synthetic quality in the sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This list has a poor memory, but I&apos;ve posted more than a few<br/>&gt; &gt; synthesized examples of chords with simple and not-so-simple<br/>&gt; &gt; brats.  Listeners seemed to prefer chords where the plain old<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning error was lower.  In fact, at least one person commented<br/>&gt; &gt; that the simple brats made beating worse, because its amplitude<br/>&gt; &gt; range is greater.

Now I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that 5ths a few cents wider than just are desirable on the far side of a 12-tone circulating temperament, because they tend to mask the rapidly beating 3rds in triads and thereby make them less objectionable, which gives me the ability to have a greater number of low-error triads on the near side -- extraordinaire, n&apos;est pas?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2010 7:15:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What&apos;s a proportional beating temperament?</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the interest of fairness and multiplicity of viewpoints, I must point out, though the point serves in argument against my stance that proportional beating is indeed a concrete and valid phenomenon, that the Scalatron is very likely devised on a divide-down oscillator scheme as are several of my vintage analog synthesizers, and therefore it is quite likely that proportional beating schemes are more apparent and more effective on this instrument than they would be when implemented within many different instruments and ensembles, just as certain delicacies of phase motion are strong and delightful on such machines but are absent or synthesized with difficulty in instruments of different construction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have time to instruct Mike in basic concepts (understanding, not just knowledge) in this matter, but for those looking on who do actually understand I write this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Cameron Bobro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds like a neat concept, I&apos;m wondering if it actually<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works in practice.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It works very well indeed.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any particular reason you believe this?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes.

Now I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that 5ths a few cents wider than just are desirable on the far side of a 12-tone circulating temperament, because they tend to mask the rapidly beating 3rds in triads and thereby make them less objectionable, which gives me the ability to have a greater number of low-error triads on the near side -- extraordinaire, n&apos;est pas?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --George<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2010 1:50:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, May 14, 2010 at 8:52 AM, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have time to instruct Mike in basic concepts (understanding, not just knowledge) in this matter, but for those looking on who do actually understand I write this.</p><p>lol, yeah, sure, ok.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2010 2:05:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, May 14, 2010 at 8:52 AM, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t have time to instruct Mike in basic concepts<br/>&gt; &gt; (understanding, not just knowledge) in this matter, but for<br/>&gt; &gt; those looking on who do actually understand I write this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; lol, yeah, sure, ok.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p><p>Thank god Mike is here to set the record straight on this stuff.<br/>It saved me a lot of time, and he knows more about it than me<br/>anyway.   -Carl</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2010 5:11:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John wrote :</p><p>What&apos;s a proportional beating temperament?</p><p>Just to be sure the question has at least one attempt of an answer :),</p><p>A proportional beating temperament is a temperament in which you can hear,<br/>at least for some of its dyads (and other than dyads octaves apart...),<br/>harmonic beatings in just intonation.</p><p>It could probably work also more generally for &quot;tunings&quot;, instead of &quot;temperaments&quot;, but these are generally also temperaments.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2010 7:26:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Jacques,</p><p>does &quot;harmonic beatings&quot; mean that the frequencies of the beats correspond to a simple ratio (e.g. 3/2)?</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John wrote :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s a proportional beating temperament?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just to be sure the question has at least one attempt of an answer :),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A proportional beating temperament is a temperament in which you can<br/>&gt; hear,<br/>&gt; at least for some of its dyads (and other than dyads octaves apart...),<br/>&gt; harmonic beatings in just intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It could probably work also more generally for &quot;tunings&quot;, instead of<br/>&gt; &quot;temperaments&quot;, but these are generally also temperaments.<br/>&gt; - - - - - - -<br/>&gt; Jacques<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>jacques.dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2010 2:27:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Jacques,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; does &quot;harmonic beatings&quot; mean that the frequencies of the beats correspond to a simple ratio (e.g. 3/2)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John.</p><p>&quot;Harmonic beatings&quot; (or harmonic beats ?), also called &quot;second order beats&quot;, are beats occuring between different harmonics (overtones) of the two sounds that form a dyad.
