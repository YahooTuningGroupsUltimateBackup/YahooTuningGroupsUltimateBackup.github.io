I&apos;ve almost replied and asked<br/>questions a dozen or so times recently, but ultimately I was too confused to<br/>even come up with a question.  So now I&apos;m betting back to the latent realm<br/>of questioning...</p><p>I took a scan through the tuning dictionary and I really didn&apos;t find what I<br/>was hoping to see, which is kind of a summary of all the different ways that<br/>commas can be used.</p><p>(Gee Monz, its not your fault -- its just that all my desires for knowledge<br/>now get projected onto the tuning dictionary.)</p><p>Commas can be &quot;left in&quot; (not necessarily a piece of terminology), &quot;tempered<br/>out&quot;, &quot;distributed&quot; and perhaps many other possibilities.  It would be nice<br/>to see all these possibilities explained in one place.  This is closely tied<br/>in with unison vector and tempering, but actually *tempering* is not<br/>necessarily necessary, and furthermore temperament sometime happens when it<br/>is not intended, as per a recent conversation with Carl in which he informed<br/>me that even by just playing an approximate 7-limit interval that occurs in<br/>a 5-limit scale I have invoked &quot;temperament&quot;.  Maybe its too much to ask but<br/>I&apos;d love to see this all tied together in one comprehensive tutorial!</p><p>It seemed to me also that in the process of defining an actual tuning that<br/>another concept of comma is perhaps introduced, but according to Carl this<br/>isn&apos;t called a comma.  When distributing a comma, which I think implies a<br/>unison vector and also implies that the comma is rational (whereas the<br/>historical use does not imply that, right?), the mechanics of distributing<br/>it are likely (but not guaranteed I don&apos;t think) to introduce irrational<br/>distributions among the various dimensions of the lattice.  This<br/>distributing reminds me of commas again, smaller commas, and my original<br/>nieve intepretation of commas in temperament involved this perhaps<br/>misfounded concept.  I&apos;m pretty vague on this, and welcome feedback.</p><p>The tonalsoft comma page currently relies heavily on a quote from Dave<br/>Keenan which gives two definitions of comma.  However neither definition<br/>seems to say much about the functions of commas as commonly discussed on<br/>this list, nor is any restriction to rational values mentioned.  It seems to<br/>me these comma functions apply regardless of the size of the comma, even if<br/>they may seem a little absurd in some cases.  So I&apos;d almost wish there was<br/>another word for this use of &quot;comma&quot;, and it doesn&apos;t quite look like<br/>&quot;anomaly&quot; is that word.  But we could also go on with this usage and when<br/>necessary invoke some term like &quot;generalized comma&quot; to indicate that a comma<br/>has gotten outside of its normal size range, and perhaps &quot;functional comma&quot;<br/>to indicate that it is the function and not the size that is at stake.<br/>Around here everyone will usually know this from context.  Nonetheless for<br/>interfacing with a larger world we may need some kind of &quot;qualification&quot;<br/>terms which can be invoked when necessary, probably rarely.</p><p>Has Paul dealt with this in his recent writings?

The quarter-comma of quarter-comma<br/>meantone, is not itself a comma, because it doesn&apos;t arise as the<br/>difference between two different stacks of rational intervals, and<br/>cannot be defined in rational terms.

Yikes!

And the other<br/>seductive fact is that for about the last 400 years in the west, the<br/>most important comma, the syntonic comma, has been something that<br/>vanishes, and for about the last 100 years, the second most<br/>important comma, the Pythagorean comma, has also been something that<br/>vanishes.</p><p>But the fact is that both of these were originally named as commas<br/>at a time when temperament was unknown.</p><p>&gt; Just doing my newbie job.  ;)</p><p>And a great job it is!</p></div><h3><a id=55481 href="#55481">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2004 11:11:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>&gt;Maybe its too much to ask but<br/>&gt;I&apos;d love to see this all tied together in one comprehensive tutorial!</p><p>Have you read Paul&apos;s papers?</p><p>&gt;It seemed to me also that in the process of defining an actual tuning that<br/>&gt;another concept of comma is perhaps introduced, but according to Carl this<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t called a comma.</p><p>As you can see from the recent threads here, there is anything but<br/>agreement on what a &quot;comma&quot; is.

You are talking about the same thing really whether A,<br/>B, and C are restricted to being just integers, or are allowed to be<br/>rational numbers. Traditionally, you let them be rational; it makes<br/>the math a little easier. That would mean your &quot;prime space&quot; in which<br/>a promo is said to be a &quot;line&quot; actually would be a (rational) vector<br/>space, and the line actually would be a line.

I think you mean something like as far as<br/>the comma functions in defining the topology (?) of the resulting scale they<br/>are all the same.  But the topology (or whatever you want to call it) does<br/>not determine the tuning.  Right?</p><p>&gt; By the way &quot;anomaly&quot; doesn&apos;t work for me as a substitute for this<br/>&gt; generic use of &quot;comma&quot; because of its implication of &quot;a failure to<br/>&gt; meet expectations&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a comma (generic sense) is not tempered out (tempered to zero),<br/>&gt; then tempering may make it larger, smaller or even negative,<br/>&gt; relative to its untempered size, or it may remain untempered.</p><p>Making it larger seems an unlikely thing if you are going to collapse the<br/>topology on that comma.  The word tempering always implies a tuning, right?<br/>Whereas a temperament as it is often used here is a class of tunings that<br/>share a topology, right?</p><p>&gt; If it is &quot;left in&quot; then it may be an actual scale step (not likely,<br/>&gt; but more likely for dieses and larger), or it may be a chromatic<br/>&gt; alteration of a scale notes when modulation occurs, or it may be<br/>&gt; symbolised as an accidental and used to notate scale notes even when<br/>&gt; the note without that accidental never occurs. Or it may not<br/>&gt; explicitly appear at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a borderline case where although there is no tempering, a<br/>&gt; comma may already be so small that it can be ignored. So although it<br/>&gt; vanishes it isn&apos;t exactly _made_ to vanish. This is most likely for<br/>&gt; kleismas and schismas and smaller.</p><p>Yet if a piece makes use of this then the piece makes the comma vanish,<br/>structurally speaking?</p><p>&gt;&gt; It seemed to me also that in the process of defining an actual<br/>&gt; tuning that<br/>&gt;&gt; another concept of comma is perhaps introduced, but according to<br/>&gt; Carl this<br/>&gt;&gt; isn&apos;t called a comma.  When distributing a comma, which I think<br/>&gt; implies a<br/>&gt;&gt; unison vector and also implies that the comma is rational (whereas<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; historical use does not imply that, right?),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Commas are always rational, ... until they are tempered. Hmm. That<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t sound too clear. :-) A comma is always _defined_ as a<br/>&gt; rational frequency ratio, or equivalently as a prime-exponent-<br/>&gt; vector. You can&apos;t just pick any random number of cents and call it a<br/>&gt; comma.</p><p>Ok, I&apos;ll be interested to see how you reply to Monz&apos;s issue about this.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This<br/>&gt;&gt; distributing reminds me of commas again, smaller commas, and my<br/>&gt; original<br/>&gt;&gt; nieve intepretation of commas in temperament involved this perhaps<br/>&gt;&gt; misfounded concept.  I&apos;m pretty vague on this, and welcome<br/>&gt; feedback.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re right. It is misfounded. The quarter-comma of quarter-comma<br/>&gt; meantone, is not itself a comma, because it doesn&apos;t arise as the<br/>&gt; difference between two different stacks of rational intervals, and<br/>&gt; cannot be defined in rational terms. The fourth root of 81/80 is<br/>&gt; irrational.</p><p>Ah, is *that* what distributing usually refers to?  I was thinking of<br/>distributing the tempering among multiple dimensions of a lattice, but this<br/>is distributing in a single dimension (though in anotheer sense multiple<br/>dimensions are involved).</p><p>&gt;&gt; It seems to<br/>&gt;&gt; me these comma functions apply regardless of the size of the<br/>&gt; comma, even if<br/>&gt;&gt; they may seem a little absurd in some cases.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed. But I did include the deliberately vague<br/>&gt; proscription &quot;typically smaller than a scale step&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So I&apos;d almost wish there was<br/>&gt;&gt; another word for this use of &quot;comma&quot;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me too. One suggestion I have is &quot;komma&quot;.</p><p>If this functioning is primarily topological, isn&apos;t there already a<br/>mathematical term for collapsing a topology according to a certain pattern,<br/>and for the specification of the pattern over which the collapse is done?<br/>Gene?</p><p>&gt;&gt; But we could also go on with this usage and when<br/>&gt;&gt; necessary invoke some term like &quot;generalized comma&quot; to indicate<br/>&gt; that a comma<br/>&gt;&gt; has gotten outside of its normal size range, and<br/>&gt; perhaps &quot;functional comma&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; to indicate that it is the function and not the size that is at<br/>&gt; stake.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those sound reasonable to me. The biggest disagreement is the one<br/>&gt; about what functions a comma may serve and still be a comma (or<br/>&gt; still be commatic).

But it was certainly my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intention to so restrict it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Monz, if you could change those two ocurrences of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;pitch ratios&quot; to &quot;rational pitches&quot; that should solve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the problem.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; well ... i don&apos;t think that&apos;s a good idea, as per my<br/>&gt; &gt; discussion above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the comma you refer to is tempered. That&apos;s the only reason it&apos;s<br/>&gt; irrational. Untempered, it may be expressed as 3^31 / 2^49 or any<br/>&gt; number of other rationals.

So although it<br/>&gt;&gt; vanishes it isn&apos;t exactly _made_ to vanish. This is most likely for<br/>&gt;&gt; kleismas and schismas and smaller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yet if a piece makes use of this then the piece makes the comma vanish,<br/>&gt;structurally speaking?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Commas are always rational, ... until they are tempered. Hmm. That<br/>&gt;&gt; doesn&apos;t sound too clear. :-) A comma is always _defined_ as a<br/>&gt;&gt; rational frequency ratio, or equivalently as a prime-exponent-<br/>&gt;&gt; vector. You can&apos;t just pick any random number of cents and call it a<br/>&gt;&gt; comma.</p><p>That&apos;s what Dave&apos;s saying.  I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s strictly true in<br/>the literature, though.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You&apos;re right. It is misfounded. The quarter-comma of quarter-comma<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone, is not itself a comma, because it doesn&apos;t arise as the<br/>&gt;&gt; difference between two different stacks of rational intervals, and<br/>&gt;&gt; cannot be defined in rational terms. The fourth root of 81/80 is<br/>&gt;&gt; irrational.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ah, is *that* what distributing usually refers to?  I was thinking of<br/>&gt;distributing the tempering among multiple dimensions of a lattice, but<br/>&gt;this is distributing in a single dimension (though in anotheer sense<br/>&gt;multiple dimensions are involved).</p><p>Distributing is distributing, any way you&apos;d like to do it!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; But we could also go on with this usage and when necessary<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; invoke some term like &quot;generalized comma&quot; to indicate<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; that a comma has gotten outside of its normal size range,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and perhaps &quot;functional comma&quot; to indicate that it is the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; function and not the size that is at stake.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Those sound reasonable to me. The biggest disagreement is the one<br/>&gt;&gt; about what functions a comma may serve and still be a comma (or<br/>&gt;&gt; still be commatic).

Actually I&apos;ve already learned so<br/>much that returning to my original line of questions feels slightly<br/>artificial, but I&apos;ll try to do it anyway since otherwise I&apos;ve kept all the<br/>intervening thoughts to myself.</p><p>Lets look at starting with the 5-limit and tempering out the 225/224 to make<br/>the 225:128 into an exact 7:4.  So my understanding is no matter how you get<br/>rid of the 225/224 comma starting from the 5-limit, you have the same<br/>temperament as a result.</p><p>So let&apos;s look at at making a tuning in this temperament.  One approach that<br/>comes to mind is to alter the 3:2 an the 5:4 by the same factor in order to<br/>make the 7:4 exact.  So this involves applying the ratio (225/224)^(1/4) to<br/>3:2 and to 5:4.  This value (225/224)^(1/4) is something like a comma<br/>itself, though I guess it isn&apos;t standard use of the term.  But this is one<br/>of those irrational comma-like quantities that I had talked about.  It is a<br/>distributed granule of a comma.  Now I understand this is not called a<br/>comma.  Originally I thought of tempering as bending the lattice in various<br/>ways and I thought of the ratios involved in the bending as being some kind<br/>of comma.  And I thought of the different ways of altering the lattice in<br/>order to achieve the different tempered tunings as different temperaments,<br/>which were to me *structurally* different even though the same comma was<br/>being tempered out.  This might be clearer if I give an example of a<br/>different tempered tuning from the same &quot;temperament&quot; that to me is<br/>structurally different.</p><p>So let&apos;s look at another example.  One thought about tempering out 225/224<br/>is that if 4:7 is to be made exact, why not make 5:7 or 6:7 exact too.  One<br/>or the other has to be picked; you can&apos;t have both by tweaking a lattice<br/>interval in all occurrences (which is what I&apos;m looking at for the moment).<br/>So let&apos;s say we want to make 5:7 exact at the expense of 6:7.  This allows<br/>you to have an exact 4:5:7 chord.  Now this means *not* tweaking the 5:4<br/>lattice interval, but instead tweaking only the 3:2, by the square of the<br/>ratio that was used in the previous example.  Now to me this is structurally<br/>different because it involves a different assumption of what the goal of the<br/>tempering process is.  Does that make sense?  Yet the result is considered<br/>the same temperament.  Yet I guess Gene would say this is all working in a<br/>real number space rather than an abelian group, and so it is just a matter<br/>or tuning and not of defining a temperament.</p><p>So this pretty much finishes my original line of thinking (or the part of it<br/>that I remember) which I think reveals most of the confusion I was having<br/>about &quot;what is a temperament&quot;.  At this moment I have no specific questions<br/>but will be interested in any responses to the above lines of thinking.  I<br/>hope I stated it clearly enough.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=55632 href="#55632">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2004 5:48:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kurt (and Gene)!</p><p>Sorry to keep butting in here, just a few points:</p><p>&gt;Yes, basically but you gave more options including an explicit<br/>&gt;mapping, and you used the term &quot;kernel&quot; instead of &quot;comma&quot;.</p><p>A kernel is actually the set of all the commas that vanish<br/>in a temperament -- which I think also includes things like<br/>powers of vanishing commas, and therefore contains an infinite<br/>number of commas.</p><p>&gt;Lets look at starting with the 5-limit and tempering out the<br/>&gt;225/224 to make the 225:128 into an exact 7:4.

But that&apos;s just me, and probably not (for example) Paul, who<br/>I&apos;ll bet likes to apply the most generality possible and then apply<br/>constraints to it.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=55647 href="#55647">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2004 9:54:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think the reference was to the Stern-Brocot tree, which is closely<br/>&gt; related to the Farey sequence.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Stern-BrocotTree.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Stern-BrocotTree.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FareySequence.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FareySequence.html</a></p><p>Specifically, the reference is to Erv Wilson&apos;s application of the Stern-Brocot tree for classifying the structures of what he calls &quot;MOS&quot; scales (which stands for &quot;moments of symmetry&quot;).

Categorizing tunings by their position on the scale tree associates tunings that have the same scale structure (in numbers of small and large steps). Any particular tuning, with a particular pattern of MOS scales that can be displayed on a horagram, is compatible with a number of different temperaments, although usually only a few make sense. Similarly, any particular temperament can be tuned in different ways, producing different scale structures. Both of these categorizations are useful in different ways.</p><p>Take for example Wilson&apos;s golden horagram #9, which is labeled &quot;Hanson&quot;. This has a generator of (4 phi + 1) / (15 phi + 4), or approximately 317.17 cents. One mapping that makes sense for this tuning is [&lt;1, 0, 1, -3|, &lt;0, 6, 5, 22|], which is a temperament for which the name &quot;Hanson&quot; has been suggested (it&apos;s the one that best fits the 14/53 generator implied in Larry Hanson&apos;s paper). But for more accuracy you can use the alternative mapping [&lt;1, 0, 1, 11|, &lt;0, 6, 5, -31|]. Or if you can tolerate a larger error, [&lt;1, 0, 1, 2|, &lt;0, 6, 5, 3|] will do. But however you interpret it, it&apos;s the same tuning, with the same scale structure.</p><p>&gt; One &gt; &gt;&gt;thing this could be useful for is notation: it would make sense to use &gt;&gt;the same notation for all scales with roughly the same g/p ratio (like &gt;&gt;meantone 504.13 / 1201.7 and flattone 507.14 / 1202.54, or dominant &gt;&gt;495.88 / 1195.23 and garibaldi 498.12 / 1200.76).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Where do you switch? Why, for instance, don&apos;t you continue on to<br/>&gt; superpyth?</p><p>Where you switch depends on how many notes you use in the notation. If you&apos;re using 12 notes, the node in the scale tree adjacent to 5/12 is 7/17; the useful range of superpyth is on the other side of 7/17, so it&apos;s on a different branch. If you carry the generators out far enough, you&apos;d use different notations for a version of meantone with a 504.13 / 1201.7 ratio and a version of flattone with a 507.14 / 1202.54 ratio.</p></div><h3><a id=55649 href="#55649">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2004 11:48:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Another way of saying it is that you choose a mapping (temperament)<br/>&gt;&gt; and an error function, calculate a tuning by minimizing the error<br/>&gt;&gt; given by your function and mapping, and finally produce a scale by<br/>&gt;&gt; choosing a reasonable number of pitches from that tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Does this help?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, this brings it into another familiar territory since in fact I have<br/>&gt;thought about and asked questions in the past about optimizing ...umm...<br/>&gt;scales, I think.
