Therefore,<br/>this is an impassioned plea (on behalf of tuning-digest readers) to send<br/>me copies of the digests, so I can complete the archives for all to<br/>access. Even if the full digests are not available, any messages you<br/>still have during those dates are very welcome.<br/>---<br/>Leigh Smith      <a href="mailto:leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au">leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au</a> (NeXTMail/MIME)<br/>                   +61-8-9380-2279 Fax: 9380-1089 Home: 9386-2994<br/>Computer Music Lab, Computer Science Dept,<br/>University of Western Australia<br/>Y2K Problem - The COBOL Programmers Superannuation Fund</p></div>
