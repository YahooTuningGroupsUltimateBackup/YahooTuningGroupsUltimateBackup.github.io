You&apos;re talking about Josef Petzval, and<br/>I *have* been talking about him lately.</p><p>I&apos;ve included Petzval as well as a few others (and some<br/>spelling corrections) submitted by Manuel, and made some<br/>other minor changes.  But apparently our server is down or<br/>something&apos;s wrong with our account, so I can&apos;t upload it yet.<br/>Will do ASAP.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
