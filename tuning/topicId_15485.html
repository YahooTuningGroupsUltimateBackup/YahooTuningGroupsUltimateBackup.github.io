I have a copy of such a translation made in 1960<br/>as an academic thesis by one Charles Samuel Smith.</p><p>1) Does anyone know if Smith is still alive (he&apos;d be 80) and, if so, how<br/>I might contact him to ask for permission?</p><p>2) Would there be interest here in my so doing?  Perhaps the text is<br/>already available somewhere?</p><p>Easiest for me would be linking raw compressed TIFs.  That<br/>runs to several meg, and forces users to download the book one page<br/>at a time.  While I do have OCR, and while my copy is certainly human<br/>readable, the many defective typewriter characters will doubtless make<br/>for many errors.  As one person working alone, I won&apos;t be up<br/>to correcting 350 pages of OCR output, but I would consider<br/>(once I work out the permissions) posting both the TIFs and<br/>the uncorrected text and then I&apos;d gratefully receive corrected HTMLed<br/>versions of the posted pages which I could eventually consolidate<br/>into something easy for everybody to download.  Any interest in<br/>this Stone Soup sort of approach?</p><p>David Feldman</p></div>
