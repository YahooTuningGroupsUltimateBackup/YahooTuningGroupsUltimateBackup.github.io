Are 3/5ths &amp; 4/7ths of an octave really nothing more than<br/>illegitimate 3/2&apos;s? Regardless of whether or not you happen to believe (as<br/>I do) that the equal division of the octave is a legitimate tuning entity<br/>outside of the _one-dimensional_, &apos;historical expenditure&apos; role in which it<br/>is often cast - I really don&apos;t think you would have to look very hard or<br/>far to find many examples along these lines.</p><p>Are JI intervals easier to tune by ear than fractions of an octave? Of<br/>course! Is this desirable and useful? Absolutely. Are these the chief/only<br/>concerns of tuning and intonation......</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/1999 10:43:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;D.

The music of the southern hemisphere proves that simple JI is not<br/>what people hear. In fact the tunings go out of there way to avoid  JI and<br/>even more so ET. Sum and difference tones hold the keys to many of these<br/>tunings. Take Lucy tuning which many reject because of what their pet theories<br/>say. Yet the actual sound is quite good. When I heard Neil Haverstick play on<br/>the 34 there was certain phenomenon that was quite intriguing. I sense that<br/>these ET approximates certain acoustical properties that are fruitful and can<br/>and are tuned by ear. But the ear must remain our guide and not a bunch of<br/>arbitrary numbers(ET). It is technology that has forced ET upon us in the<br/>sense that it is easier done than JI on computer.  The simplest scales are not<br/>possible without beats created by their inaccuracy of the tuning. I &apos;m not a<br/>great as stickler as La Monte about these things either. A few steps and I no<br/>longer can tell what I&apos;m listen to.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
