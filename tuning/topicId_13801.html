I wonder if you care to participate in the<br/>discussion of ranking the discordance of the tetrads that Joseph Pehrson has<br/>put up at <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/140/tuning_lab.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/140/tuning_lab.html</a>. If you&apos;ve<br/>been following the discussion, Joseph has responded to various theoretical<br/>alternatives of ranking the tetrads and I&apos;ve made the claim that a<br/>roughness-based model like yours (or any Helmholtz-type model) accounts for<br/>much less of Joseph&apos;s perceptions than a tonalness-based model like<br/>Parncutt&apos;s (or any Rameau-type model). I wonder if you&apos;d care to contribute<br/>to the discussion by calculating your best estimate of the dissonance values<br/>of these tetrads. Each is expressed in cents above the lowest note, which is<br/>always 301.09 Hz. The timbre used has harmonic partials with the amplitude<br/>of the nth partial proportional to</p><p>3/((2n-1)(2n+1))</p><p>I would have just used your Matlab program but you&apos;ve mentioned some<br/>refinements and I&apos;d like to give you a chance to incorporate them.</p><p>We are really just seeking the &quot;truth&quot; here -- we are not out to criticize<br/>or discredit anyone -- so your participation would be most appreciated.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
