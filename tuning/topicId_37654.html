Have you ever met an actor?  I once saw Ezra<br/>threaten percussionists with coming up on stage and grabbing their sticks<br/>away from them if they weren&apos;t doing their job right!  Ezra has a String<br/>Quartet that contains a clarinet: consider this a clue.  No one cringes from<br/>31ET.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; which guys?<br/>&gt;</p><p>You, Paul.  And anyone that buys into what he is selling.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Listen<br/>&gt; &gt; to the music and tell me you hear an approximating of just as an<br/>&gt; &gt;intent in a<br/>&gt; &gt; particular piece of Sims.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; not just in the way i would have conceived &quot;just&quot; myself, but after<br/>&gt; reading his writings, yes i can hear it.</p><p>This sounds awfully academic to me.  No offense.  Think about it.  The<br/>feelings that one can obtain in Just are not in Ezra&apos;s music.  Are they in La<br/>Monte Young&apos;s music? Yes.  Even inharmonic, Partch is Just.  What I wonder is<br/>whether you would accept that 24ET is really just a great simulation of<br/>important 11 limit JI intervals.  Wyschnegradsky used to claim this.</p><p> when producing two notes in<br/>&gt; a clear ratio, he often introduces the summation tone, which is often<br/>&gt; not typically something i would have thought of as &quot;consonant&quot;. but<br/>&gt; as the difference tones reinforce the original tones, and as this<br/>&gt; whole phenomenon is inextricably tied in with the ratios involved,<br/>&gt; i&apos;d say that yes, the particular just phenomenon that he is<br/>&gt; interested in working with probably comes through in some of the<br/>&gt; recordings and performances i&apos;ve heard -- though we&apos;d have to be<br/>&gt; inside his head to know for sure.</p><p>Paul, you need to be in Ezra&apos;s head to know for sure?  I can only use my head<br/>and when I hear the many efforts that have been made in 72ET I am at a loss<br/>to find some use of chorale writing simulating Just.  Hunting for a<br/>difference tone to defend justness is a little silly.  It should be clear<br/>enough to tell whether there is a just borrowing in 72.  I simply do not hear<br/>it.  And no one has yet named a piece that proves otherwise.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I find he uses 72 very well for many of its<br/>&gt; &gt; properties.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; absolutely. a big modulating 37-limit scale is his stated intent.<br/>&gt; this is even a stricter invocation of ji than what joseph is doing in<br/>&gt; 72 (things that no ji scale could do), and yet joseph himself is<br/>&gt; telling us that ji is his intent. so that leads us into some of the<br/>&gt; far corners of the great &quot;what is ji&quot; debate that i don&apos;t feel<br/>&gt; inclined to revisit now. let alone the philosophical vagaries<br/>&gt; of &quot;hearing intent&quot;</p><p>Paul, this does not have to be about debating.  And it is not about intent.<br/>It is about products.  If a composer hears just in his or her head, and<br/>someone cannot hear the music as just who knows what just sounds like, does<br/>the intent insure the result?</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=37656 href="#37656">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2002 5:57:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; And anyone that buys into what he is selling.</p><p>why don&apos;t i run that buy him next time i see him?</p><p>&gt; This sounds awfully academic to me.

The chord progression that was given as an example is<br/>certainly an experiment.  That can be proved because I didn&apos;t know what it<br/>sounded like until Monz did the audio file.  The decimal counterpoint<br/>examples are also experiments.  Real music&apos;s less likely to demonstrate<br/>the almost-just harmony because it isn&apos;t designed to do so.  Most of my<br/>Miracle pieces have been melodic, because that&apos;s easier.</p><p>The piece I uploaded on Monday, near the top of<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/music/">http://x31eq.com/music/</a>&gt; does use mostly 9-limit intervals<br/>between the bass and melody parts.  Because they&apos;re an octave or two<br/>apart, it isn&apos;t that obvious, but enough that I could spot some wrong<br/>notes.  I don&apos;t know if it counts as &quot;JI-like&quot; or not, and I&apos;m not really<br/>interested.  But it is different to what you&apos;d get by choosing random<br/>intervals from 72-equal.  It might count as atonal as well.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=37710 href="#37710">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2002 12:32:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Real music&apos;s less likely to demonstrate<br/>&gt; the almost-just harmony because it isn&apos;t designed to do so.</p><p>what about james tenney&apos;s music for 6 harps? for 6 guitars? he uses<br/>72-equal as a &apos;proxy&apos; for just intonation -- if sims or pehrson don&apos;t<br/>make the point, maybe tenney does?</p></div><h3><a id=37718 href="#37718">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2002 4:04:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wasn&apos;t the harp piece a lattice of 3&apos;s and 7&apos;s</p><p>emotionaljourney22 wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Real music&apos;s less likely to demonstrate<br/>&gt; &gt; the almost-just harmony because it isn&apos;t designed to do so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; what about james tenney&apos;s music for 6 harps? for 6 guitars? he uses<br/>&gt; 72-equal as a &apos;proxy&apos; for just intonation -- if sims or pehrson don&apos;t<br/>&gt; make the point, maybe tenney does?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=37757 href="#37757">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2002 2:04:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Wasn&apos;t the harp piece a lattice of 3&apos;s and 7&apos;s</p><p>the one i know of used factors of 5 as well but was rendered in 72-<br/>equal -- it&apos;s mentioned in the PNM article on partch, johnston, and<br/>tenney, and notes that tenney exploited 72-equal&apos;s &quot;pun&quot; of 45/32 =<br/>7/5.</p></div>
