It<br/>seems<br/>the accidentals are weird.  So, what was intended, Meantone,<br/>Pythagorean or, as suggested by Sabat, a form of extended Just, which<br/>has the greatest flexibility.</p><p>The article is here:</p><p><a href="http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=4210">http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=4210</a></p><p>Also there is an mp3 of the Feldman piece being discusses, as well as<br/>a<br/>PDF of the score with some of the extended just ratio interpretations<br/>decided upon by Sabat.</p><p>Interesting stuff...</p><p>J.
