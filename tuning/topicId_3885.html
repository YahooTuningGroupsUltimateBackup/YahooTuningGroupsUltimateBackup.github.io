I would imagine this interval could become meaningful if<br/>constructed by stacking two 7/4s. Let&apos;s say each of the 7/4s is about 1 cent<br/>sharp. They will still be recognizable 7/4s for all intents and purposes.<br/>However, the result of stacking them will be closer to 23/15 than to 49/32.<br/>If the 7/4s are 1 cent flat, you get a 26/17. Will that change the musical<br/>function of effect of the interval? No. Whether the resultant interval is<br/>49/32 or 23/15 or 26/17 or anything in-between, its only audible relation to<br/>JI will be through the 7/4s that made it up.</p><p>If not constructed from simpler intervals via an additional note(s), the<br/>interval 49/32 has no audible qualities that could distinguish it from<br/>nearby rational or irrational intervals.</p></div>
