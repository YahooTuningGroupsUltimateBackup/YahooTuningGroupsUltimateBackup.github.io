So I follow the rule -- if in doubt,<br/>leave it out.  What does that prove?</p><p>The argument for it being temperament finding is that only<br/>temperaments can have an error, because error is a function of the<br/>tuning.  So as the search would make no sense without considering<br/>errors it must be searching for tuned temperaments and not temperament<br/>classes.  To avoid duplication, only one tuning for each class is<br/>listed.</p><p>I do also say that in primerr.pdf, I assign errors to temperament<br/>classes.  That&apos;s arguable.  As there are functions that give the error<br/>given a mapping, you could say that, and I did.  It does look<br/>inconsistent though.  so sue me.  Outside the introduction, it&apos;s<br/>always tuned temperaments that have errors, which is correct because<br/>the proof depends on the error being a function of the single tuning<br/>parameter.</p><p>Section 4.4 is correct.  &quot;Say that you&rsquo;re looking for temperaments. .<br/>.&quot;  It&apos;s temperaments that are important, not temperament classes.<br/>You could look for temperament classes instead, but why bother with<br/>the extra word?</p><p>If you want to pick nits, why not find an example that&apos;s clearly<br/>wrong?

But I didn&apos;t add footnotes explaining my reasoning<br/>in each case so, not having thought about it as much as me, you may<br/>not understand why I used a particular term.  I may also have made<br/>mistakes.</p><p>But the basic, obvious fact remains that I have been using the term<br/>&quot;temperament class&quot;.  And I&apos;ve never claimed to use it correctly in<br/>all cases.  What I&apos;ve said is, when there&apos;s a need to make a<br/>distinction between something with a tuning and something without,<br/>temperaments should have tunings.  I seem to be one of the first<br/>people to make this distinction, because I still don&apos;t know of a term<br/>that pre-dated my usage of &quot;temperament family&quot;.  I adopted the term<br/>in good faith and I&apos;ve only changed it once because of a conflict with<br/>a newer coinage.  I don&apos;t plan to change it again on my own website<br/>unless there&apos;s a good reason.
