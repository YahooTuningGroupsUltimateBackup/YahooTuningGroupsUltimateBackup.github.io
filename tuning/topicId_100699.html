Let&apos;s start with harmonics 8-16,<br/>which using the notation you&apos;ve described before, lays out as follows:</p><p>8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15:16 - A:B:C:D:E:F:G:H:A</p><p>You&apos;ve described this scale as a sort of maximally &quot;natural&quot; scale<br/>that basic mathematics reveals. Now, as you&apos;re also aware, the usual<br/>7-note diatonic scale is not justly intoned, and hence diverges from<br/>this in a way that you might perhaps consequently call &quot;less natural.&quot;<br/>However, this scale is musically useful enough that billions of people<br/>have been entranced by it throughout the course of history, despite<br/>its divergence from the harmonic series. So one good approach to<br/>finding new possibilities is to hedonistically say &quot;to hell with<br/>naturalness&quot; and find other scales that likewise warp and diverge from<br/>the harmonic series in a useful and musically entrancing way.</p><p>Let&apos;s start with that A-B-C-D-E pentachord, which is in a perfect JI<br/>8:9:10:11:12 ratio. There&apos;s an awful lot of intervals in this<br/>pentachord that are close in size to one another, so one way to start<br/>is to deliberately detune things so various intervals in this<br/>pentachord end up being the same size. The usual way to do this is to<br/>make the A-B-C equal in size by flattening the B (or sharpening the C)<br/>a bit, until the 9/8 and 10/9 become equal - this is the familiar<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; temperament that we&apos;re all used to. If you do some tricks<br/>and reflect this equal A-B-C pattern along the scale in an interesting<br/>way, you can arrive at a sort of maximally symmetric scale, which ends<br/>up being the diatonic scale that we&apos;re all familiar with. Part of the<br/>point of this list is to get away from that, so a good way to go is to<br/>equate other intervals and reflect them instead.</p><p>Let&apos;s break with tradition and NOT make 9/8 and 10/9 equal. Instead,<br/>we&apos;re going to make 10/9, 11/10, and 12/11 are all equal, so that A-B<br/>is a big interval, and B-C-D-E are all small intervals that are some<br/>kind of average of 10/9, 11/10, and 12/11. We&apos;ll distribute the<br/>tempering error evenly throughout this process, and if you work the<br/>math out that means we sharpen the B a bit, flatten the C slightly,<br/>flatten the D, and sharpen the E slightly as well, until B-C-D-E are<br/>all separated by a constant interval of about 163 cents, and the A-B<br/>is about 224 cents. So the 5-note scale ends up being, in cents - 0.0,<br/>223.51496, 386.26247, 549.00997, 711.75748. If you mash it, it still<br/>sounds like 8:9:10:11:12, but warbles a little bit.</p><p>Note that that B-E is a perfect fourth (which is now slightly flat<br/>because of all the tempering). Well, there&apos;s also a perfect fourth<br/>between that highest note - the E - and the octave, right? So we&apos;re<br/>going to hedonistically throw caution to the wind, run all over the<br/>12:13:14:15:16, and just double the pattern of steps. If we do this,<br/>we arrive at another one of these maximally symmetric scales, which<br/>comprises part of what is called &quot;porcupine&quot; temperament:</p><p>! /Users/mike/Desktop/porcupine.scl<br/>!<br/>POTE porcupine[7] MOS<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 223.51496<br/> 386.26247<br/> 549.00997<br/> 711.75748<br/> 874.50499<br/> 1037.25249<br/> 2/1</p><p>The latter half is completely divergent from 12:13:14:15:16, but this<br/>to my ears adds harmonic variety and sounds awesome anyway.</p><p>If you find that you like this scale, there are two other temperaments<br/>right behind it called &quot;negri&quot; and &quot;mohajira,&quot; both of which are also<br/>awesome.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100700 href="#100700">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2011 10:03:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>That was a helpful description of Procupine.
