That rules out<br/>&gt; all 12-tone JI scales, and all 12-tone scales embedded in odd ETs.</p><p>Doh! You are correct, the only scale I&apos;ve plugged in so far that can<br/>use the trick at D is 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 from 22. And I&apos;m getting<br/>used to a &apos;C&apos; basis for these things, so I made a C version of it<br/>as well.</p><p>One anecdote, most of my music is still strongly coming from a 12-equal<br/>background. Now I&apos;m beginning to Just Intonate those tunes which can<br/>easilly map to a fixed pallette of pitches, and I&apos;m also experimenting<br/>with improvising in the 12-of-N scales we&apos;ve been discussing.</p><p>Yesterday, my wife heard me playing an original composition (I played<br/>guitar, accompaniement was midi) and she asked me to play another. I<br/>started it, then things got a little strange... I<br/>fiddled with the B string, the G. It turned out that the pianist in<br/>the midi orchestra had inherited a piano tuned from 22tet.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
