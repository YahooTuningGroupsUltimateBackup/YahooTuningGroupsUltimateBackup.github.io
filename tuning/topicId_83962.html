I would like to get your viewpoints regarding the topics I wrote there. To work out two equations with four variables I had to use an uncommon procedure to obtain K and P semitone factors which establish the three Piagui scales.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>Lima, June 27, 2009<br/><a href="mailto:piagui@ec-red.com">piagui@ec-red.com</a></p><p>You will get in the file full information on this musical system. Some weeks ago I filed chord wave peak graphs of the e-tempered and the Piagui I scale where you can see  optimal Piagui graph responses of the twenty four major and minor triads.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2009 9:14:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mario Pizarro&quot; &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To tuning yahoogroups,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Today I placed the file</p><p>This file was deleted, as it was not placed in your<br/>personal folder.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
