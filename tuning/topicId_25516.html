NPR&apos;s Sunday Week End Edition actually<br/>announced Partsch&apos;s anniversary and played a sound clip of him. In the same<br/>breath or breaths they mentioned that on this date  in l967 &quot;White Rabbit&quot;<br/>and &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; were released. A day full of auspicion?</p></div><h3><a id=25566 href="#25566">ðŸ”—</a>J P Fitch &#x3C;jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2001 6:10:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The BBC Radio-3 program &quot;Music Matters&quot; had an article about Partch,<br/>with a short clip.

Now it might be true if we could identify who<br/>they are and where there recordings are that these people have produced. I myself have not heard<br/>any.<br/>    It seems this whole line of Jargon is saying that if you follow in his steps in anyway your<br/>music must not be good. Since they know before hearing it. Who are these devotee&apos;s. I can think of<br/>only one who is a composer anyway and he has absolutely no recordings at all. His only other<br/>devotees are performers. So just what are they saying<br/>    This is another part of the newspeak to assimilate Partch on one hand and destroy or<br/>invalidate as many of his ideas as possible. They at least deserve not to be buried because they<br/>threaten the Status Quo.<br/>    What if i said that the trouble was that the music produced by the Webern devotees is just not<br/>very good.  It wouldn&apos;t even be worth discussing</p><p>J P Fitch wrote:</p><p>&gt; The bit you may not like was that he [James<br/>&gt; Wood] said that the trouble was thatho just not very good.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=25953 href="#25953">ðŸ”—</a>J P Fitch &#x3C;jpff@maths.bath.ac.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2001 2:49:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would add that James Wood is a well know and highly respected<br/>composer and percussionist; he described himself as influenced by<br/>Partch.
