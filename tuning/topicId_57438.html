I&apos;m can&apos;t remember if the Microzone<br/>does velocity, but it has a very specialized aftertouch<br/>implementation.</p><p>No matter which one you meant, the corresponding MIDI<br/>messages can be filtered out by a sequencer on their<br/>way to anywhere else.  Have you tried that?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
