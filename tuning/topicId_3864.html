I compose music, mostly electronic, and have made most of my livings<br/>as a piano technician, electronics technician and performer, in that order.<br/>Naturally, I&apos;m fascinated by the sounds of different tunings and have had<br/>the fun of doing some of them. (If anyone needs advice on how to get two<br/>pianos to be a reliable quarter-tone apart and don&apos;t already know a<br/>reference for same, I can tell you how.)<br/>Possibly, the most extravagant temperament accomplishment I witnessed was<br/>when Pietro Grossi, who taught at Indiana in 1966, proudly demonstrated to<br/>us his 118-tone-per-octave  equal temperament. I also had the fun of playing<br/>on a sort of square piano with normally spaced keys, 96 of them covering an<br/>octave. This was designed for Julian Carillo&apos;s music.<br/>I discovered this list via the PTG site.<br/>Cheers</p></div><h3><a id=3865 href="#3865">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>7/3/1999 5:36:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Jay,</p><p>I&apos;m not sure you will recall, but I had a class with you at the North<br/>Carolina School of the Arts where I studied bassoon with Mark Popkin.  You<br/>told the class - you were a guest lecturer - that music needed to be about<br/>50% predictable to be good.  It was an important insight for me.</p><p>I had heard that you composed electronic music.  Have you used microtonal<br/>construction in you compositions?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3872 href="#3872">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The lowest ET that improves on that is<br/>118-tET<br/>&gt;&gt; where the largest error is 3 cents.</p><p>118-tET really shines in the good old 5-limit, where the maximum error in<br/>the consonant intervals is 0.39 cents (while the best smaller ET, 53, it&apos;s<br/>1.41 cents). So if you want an ET, but 53 isn&apos;t Just Intonation enough for<br/>you, 118 is your best bet.</p></div>
