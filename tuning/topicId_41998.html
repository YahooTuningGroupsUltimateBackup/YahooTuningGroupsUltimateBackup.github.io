Many organ recordings<br/>report only thiongs like &quot;modified meantone&quot; or &quot;well-tempered&quot;<br/>without mentioning the name of the tuning.<br/>The only exception I know are 2 CD&apos;s I own from the Buxtehude series<br/>recorded by Harald Vogel for MDG. The booklets of these CD&apos;s contain<br/>a detailed description of the tuning including cent values.&lt;&lt;</p><p>Ayeee, what about our two CD&apos;s ???  I put as much info in the booklets as the<br/>printer said it would hold.  The &apos;Six Degree&quot; recording has full charts of<br/>all tunings used. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>   I also don&apos;t see academic resistance when the tunings come first.  The<br/>ears seem to win over the minds.  NOw, If I tell them that there is something<br/>new to be considered, the intellectually based fear and loathing blocks the<br/>sensual input, but since I can do the tunings with my mouth shut, that is<br/>less of a problem now than ever before.<br/>   Hilltop Recording Studio, here in Nashville, just completed a country<br/>track session with a well-tempered piano and none of the musicians noticed<br/>that there was any difference, just that it sounded good.  A large percentage<br/>of the instructors at the Blair School of Music at Vanderbilt are also now<br/>using well-tempered pianos.<br/>Regards,</p><p>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/>or,<br/> if you want to actually listen to some of these things on a piano:  go to<br/><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=42003 href="#42003">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2003 6:49:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, a440a@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_41998.html#41998">/tuning/topicId_41998.html#41998</a></p><p>&gt; NOw, If I tell them that there is something<br/>&gt; new to be considered, the intellectually based fear and loathing<br/>blocks the sensual input, but since I can do the tunings with my<br/>mouth shut, that is less of a problem now than ever before.</p><p>***Hmmm, this is an interesting point.
