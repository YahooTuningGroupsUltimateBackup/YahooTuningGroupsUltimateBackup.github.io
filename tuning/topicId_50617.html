I know there are other chords here, but this gives you<br/>    a general idea. Sadly, some common 12 EDO chords have been destroyed to create all the<br/>     new stuff. You had to expect that.</p><p>       Regards,</p><p>        Stephen Szpak</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Take advantage of our limited-time introductory offer for dial-up Internet access. <a href="http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup">http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup</a></p></div><h3><a id=50618 href="#50618">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2003 8:38:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Stephen Szpak&quot; &lt;stephen_szpak@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ATTENTION::::: If anyone knows the name of this scale please get<br/>back to<br/>&gt; me.<br/>&gt;                         Comments of any sort are welcome.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing much like it in Scala&apos;s scale listing.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;              0-61-200-261-400-500-561-700-761-900-961-1100-1200</p><p>Here are chords going around the circle of fifths; the first column<br/>are major thirds, the third column fifths, and the fourth column<br/>sevenths.

This is followed by three triads where<br/>the major and minor thirds are of an intermediate size, and then a<br/>wolf flat fifth chord. Following that is another 12-equal triad, with<br/>a sharp seventh, and then a supermajor triad/tetrad, the seventh of<br/>which is sharp if it is supposed to be a 9/5, and is more plausible as<br/>a 20/11. We have two more supermajor triads with 12-et 1000-cent<br/>sevenths to go with them, and the whole thing wraps itself up with<br/>another wolf fifth, the 439-300-739 chord can be taken as a &quot;ratwolf&quot;<br/>351/350-magic triad of sorts. If we knew what intervals you wanted it<br/>would be possible to optimize this.</p></div>
