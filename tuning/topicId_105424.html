This happens to be the difference between five stacked<br/>11/9s and 11/4. (I wouldn&apos;t have expected that relationship; squaring<br/>the comma would make me expect to see a stack of four 11/9s or two<br/>3/2s.

There are some improprieties, but<br/>they&apos;re not outrageous. At 17 notes, some approximations to 7 start<br/>creeping in, so we could define the temperament out to the full<br/>11-limit if we wanted to -- I just haven&apos;t gotten there yet, in part<br/>because I find 17 tones to be unwieldy.</p><p>Here&apos;s the 10-tone MOS in 55 EDO:</p><p>!

I&apos;ve been<br/>stubbornly reading for two years now, and I still frequently don&apos;t<br/>grok why the various commas are valuable musically -- until I want to<br/>do something specific musically, and stumble across the comma (or<br/>comma combination) as I did here.

You&apos;re probably thinking something like &quot;17edo doesn&apos;t temper out 81/80&quot;, but that statement is nonsensical because 17edo is simply a collection of intervals. with no specific relationship to JI. What you should say is that the 17edo *patent val* (which maps both 6/5 and 5/4 to 5 steps) doesn&apos;t temper out 81/80. On the other hand, the 17c val, which maps 6/5 to 4 steps and 5/4 to 6 steps, is almost as good as, if not better than, the patent val (however you care to measure goodness), and that equal temperament *does* temper out 81/80.</p><p>So, for porcupine, it looks like you&apos;re correct that no patent vals do the trick, but the 23bc val (which Mike Battaglia has suggested before as a tool to learn porcupine categories) tempers out 250/243 and is on the &quot;wrong side&quot; of 15. Similarly, for meantone, 17c is one of the equal temperaments you seek; it&apos;s on the opposite side of 12 from the familiar meantone temperaments like 19 and 31.</p><p>Of course, these specific equal temperaments (23bc and 17c) are much higher in error than the rank-2 temperaments porcupine and meantone. We can all feel comfortable saying that meantone[12] is 7L5s rather than 5L7s, even though there are technically meantone tunings (such as 17c) that make it 5L7s. Why? Because the optimal meantone tuning is *unambiguously* on the 7L5s side; there&apos;s no doubt about it.</p><p>But, for any rank-2 temperament, there&apos;s always some number of notes that&apos;s large enough that you might as well call it equal at that point because it&apos;s ambiguous which way the MOS sequence goes.</p><p>For porcupine, 15 should definitely be 7L8s, and 22 should *almost* certainly be 7L15s (although some people may prefer things like 29edo), but by the time you get to porcupine[37], it&apos;s totally unclear whether it should be 22L15s or 15L22s, so you might as well stop there and call it 37edo.</p><p>For meantone, 12 should definitely be 7L5s, and 19 should probably be 12L7s for the usual meanings of &quot;meantone&quot; (although &quot;flattone land&quot; on the other side of 19 is very interesting), but by the time you get to 31edo you might as well call it equal because both 19L12s and 12L19s are perfectly reasonable.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, it actually looks like a possibly interesting property of<br/>&gt; mohaha[31] that it can flip from XL+YS to YL+XS without using crazily<br/>&gt; distorted mappings. Same temperament, similar mappings, flipped MOS<br/>&gt; structure for specific tunings.</p><p>This property is in no way particular to mohaha, as I explained above. It&apos;s bound to happen at some point with every conceivable rank-2 temperament.</p><p>&gt; Is this related to the (e.g.) &quot;7&amp;12&quot; notation for meantone that I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; never properly understood? (I understand that it means that we use the<br/>&gt; vals of 7 EDO and 12 EDO somehow, but I don&apos;t know how those vals<br/>&gt; relate to the generators used.)</p><p>&quot;7&amp;12&quot; indeed refers to the patent vals of 7edo and 12edo. I could explain the rest if you really want, but we might want to take it over to tuning-math because it could get nitty gritty really quick. =) A key concept is the &quot;extended Euclidean algorithm&quot;.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=105458 href="#105458">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2012 7:24:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; It seems like you&apos;re making the mistake...of assuming patent vals.</p><p>No! I win! :)</p><p>Seriously, though, I do understand the difference between patent vals<br/>and others; I&apos;m afraid my language got sloppy. When I was looking at<br/>porcupine and meantone, I went to Graham&apos;s temperament finder, went to<br/>the unison vector search, and entered my comma. Entering 250/243 gives<br/>7, 15, 8, 14c, 22, 1c, 29, 21c, 6bc, and 30 -- no 23bc. The only<br/>non-patent val of those that has more than 15 notes is 21c, which I<br/>checked out, and it&apos;s on the &quot;right side&quot; of 15 EDO. Entering 81/80<br/>gives 12, 7, 19, 5, 24, 31, 14c, 26, 17c, and 2c. And oops, there&apos;s<br/>17c, but apparently I didn&apos;t try it. [Hangs head...]</p><p>My penchant for patent vals comes mostly from a pragmatic issue: I<br/>have a spreadsheet that I do a lot of calculations in (e.g., on the<br/>way to work, when I don&apos;t have an Internet connection), and in Excel<br/>it&apos;s easy to generate the patent vals.</p><p>In one sheet, I plug in up to four commas and see every EDO that<br/>tempers out each of them: and by &quot;every EDO&quot;, I mean that I<br/>automatically see whether the patent val tempers them out. If I want<br/>to look at an alternate val I have to manually enter it.</p><p>In another sheet, I plug in the EDO that I want, and it shows me the<br/>values for all of the intervals contained in Scala (plus a few other<br/>cats and dogs) using the patent val: If I want to use an alternate<br/>val, I have to manually change it. If I have access to Graham&apos;s<br/>temperament finder then I can get the alternate val easily enough --<br/>but only if it&apos;s on the list, like 17c was for 81/80. If it&apos;s not on<br/>the list, like 23bc for 250/243, I&apos;d have to manually mess around<br/>until I can find it. That&apos;s why I said this:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I was trying to work out something similar in other temperaments, but<br/>&gt;&gt; I can&apos;t, or at least not quickly.</p><p>You said:</p><p>&gt; Of course, these specific equal temperaments (23bc and 17c) are much<br/>&gt; higher in error than the rank-2 temperaments porcupine and meantone.</p><p>No doubt. A 730-cent &quot;perfect fifth&quot; (23bc-tuned porcupine) no longer<br/>seems so perfect.</p><p>&gt; Why? Because the optimal meantone tuning is *unambiguously* on the<br/>&gt; 7L5s side; there&apos;s no doubt about it.</p><p>Works for me.</p><p>&gt; But, for any rank-2 temperament, there&apos;s always some number of notes that&apos;s<br/>&gt; large enough that you might as well call it equal at that point because it&apos;s<br/>&gt; ambiguous which way the MOS sequence goes.</p><p>That makes some sense. I was starting to intuit something like that,<br/>which is why I said this:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Maybe I&apos;m not using a large scale, and should look<br/>&gt;&gt; at meantone[19] or [31] instead....</p><p>...and your explanation makes it clear why this is a property of every<br/>rank-2 temperament rather than of mohaha.</p><p>&gt; &quot;7&amp;12&quot; indeed refers to the patent vals of 7edo and 12edo. I could explain<br/>&gt; the rest if you really want, but we might want to take it over to tuning-math<br/>&gt; because it could get nitty gritty really quick. =) A key concept is the<br/>&gt; &quot;extended Euclidean algorithm&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if I want the full explanation or not. :) I just want to<br/>know why it&apos;s important. When someone says &quot;that&apos;s the 7&amp;12<br/>temperament&quot;, I know that means meantone -- but that&apos;s just<br/>memorization. When someone says, &quot;that&apos;s the 12f&amp;29 temperament&quot;, I<br/>have no idea how this identifies the temperament as Cassandra. And<br/>maybe it&apos;s easier not to care, if Graham&apos;s temperament finder will<br/>tell me what commas it tempers out, etc., anyway.</p><p>I&apos;ll look up &quot;extended Euclidean algorithm&quot; and see if I can<br/>understand that, and then, if I don&apos;t go into vapor lock, I may join<br/>the tuning-math list and ask you about it there.</p><p>Thanks as always for your patience,<br/>Jake</p></div>
