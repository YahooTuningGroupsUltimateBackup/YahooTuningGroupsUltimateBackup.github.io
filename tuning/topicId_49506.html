Sonata (b-flat minor, op 35), the last movement &quot;that&apos;s not music anymore&quot;, wishing to say Chopin had reached with that tremendous piece a new realm which will for long not bee understood by mediocre conservative academicians. Yes, it was Schumann who brought Chopin into public interest in the german speaking area. (The other great composer who was grateful for Schumann&apos;s publicistic aid was Brahms...)<br/>Actually, I cannot imagine that Chopins beautyful works are in any tuning outside of 12 tet, take his Pr&iuml;&iquest;&half;lude c# minor op 45<br/>with its fantastic modulations being played with any different tuning - it would sooner or later sound completely mistuned.<br/>Sorry, but I do think so.<br/>At that time the &quot;well tempered piano&quot; was absolutely well established. And since that time no manufacturer of musical instruments would think of applying any other tuning than 12 tet.<br/>This is why we may concentrate on our digital friend to realize independently of all limitating influences (and as precisely as we wish) our tuning ideas.<br/>As I will keep on studying my Septatonic Scale.<br/>So far 4 today.<br/>P. S.: I find that discussion of &quot;antisemitism&quot; absolutely out of place in our forum, although I am active member of the &quot;Rock against Racism&quot; movement...</p><p>Bye</p><p>Werner</p></div><h3><a id=49524 href="#49524">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2003 3:10:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Wernerlinden@a... wrote:</p><p>(The other great composer who was grateful for Schumann&apos;s publicistic<br/>aid was Brahms...)</p><p>Some people claim the hats off remark was about Brahms.
