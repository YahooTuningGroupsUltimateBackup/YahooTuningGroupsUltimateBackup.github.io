This organ was designed by the Dutch physicist Adriaan Dani&#xFFFD;l Fokker.  He based it on the 17th-century tuning theories of Christiaan Huygens, who divided the octave into 31 equal [gelijke] intervals.  Various composers, among them Henk Badings, have written for this instrument.&quot;</p><p>Maybe somebody knows more?</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Dale C. Carr</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/5/1999 4:52:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, the organ will be removed in the beginning of next year. Now there<br/>are negotations with the organ builder to do this and preserve it, so it<br/>can be restored in a new place. Presumably this will be the new music centre<br/>with the new IJsbreker and other music organisations inside.<br/>So the organ will lose its historic location, but we don&apos;t need to be too<br/>sad about it, since this place can only bear a small audience, and the pipes<br/>are also somewhat hidden.<br/>Let me remind about the concert in the Teylers Museum next Sunday, 11 o&apos;clock.<br/>Joop van Goozen will play the organ and this is really the last chance of<br/>hearing the organ there! The next opportunity won&apos;t be before 2002.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
