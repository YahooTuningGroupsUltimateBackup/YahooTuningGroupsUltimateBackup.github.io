However, no one generator will encompass all of the<br/>possibilities of an et, and 46+26, for one, gives<br/>it worthy competition.</p><p>41+31</p><p>There may not seem much left to say about the miracle system, so I&apos;ll<br/>use the occasion to point out that one possible &quot;middle way&quot; is to<br/>employ a temperament of a temperament, or even a temperament of a<br/>temperament of a temperament. The 10-note scale mentioned in<br/>connection with 3/31 is 7777777779 in this tuning, and we also have<br/>Blackjack, Canasta and whatever the 41-note temperament is being<br/>called. I would count Canasta, the 31-from-72 system, as a<br/>temperament of 31 notes, and not a scale; considered from that point<br/>of view one might ask what happens if we use it, rather than 31-et,<br/>for meantone versions of diatonic, 12-notes, etc. In fact what<br/>happens is that we get a lot of different versions of these things as<br/>we modulate from one key to another. For instance, three of the 31<br/>keys give us a diatonic scale which is simply the 72-version of JI<br/>diatonic, and others give a variety of other 7-note scales.</p><p>46+26</p><p>From 26/46 = 13/23 ~ 4/7 we obtain 7/23 &lt; 11/36 &lt; 4/13 as our<br/>generator, with (7+11)/(23+36) = 18/59 = 36/118 belonging to the same<br/>family. For anyone particularly interested in pure triads the 36/118<br/>temperament is highly recommendable. Generator steps are -6, -11, 2,<br/>3, -2, -6 for the odd primes to 17, but of course this is modulo the<br/>half-octave, so it doesn&apos;t beat miracle. Scale possibilities include<br/>(11 11 14)x2, (11 11 11 3)x2, and (8383833)x2; in addition<br/>(2333233323333)x2 is an alternative to Blackjack or Canasta.</p><p>50+22</p><p>From 50/22 = 25/11 ~ 9/4 we get 9/25 &lt; 13/36 &lt; 4/11; we also have<br/>(13+4)/(36+11) = 17/47 = 34/94 as a closely-related generator.<br/>Generator steps are 6, -1, 10, -3, -10 up to 13; and we have a<br/>10-note scale with pattern (3 10 3 10 10)x2, as well as an<br/>alternative to Blackjack with pattern (33343334334)x2, and 22 notes.</p><p>53+19</p><p>Judging by its origins from 53 and 19, we would expect this to be a<br/>triad machine, and in fact it is--the 72-version of kleismic. The<br/>first four odd primes are mapped to 6, 5, 22, and -21, and<br/>5/19 &lt; 19/72 &lt; 14/53 locates the generator. It has scales of form<br/>4 15 4 15 4 15 4 15 15, 4 4 11 4 4 11 4 4 11 4 11 and 444744474447447.</p><p>45+27</p><p>The 27-et is a good scale division, but 45 seems to have little to<br/>recommend it, so one might wonder what it is doing on this list. In<br/>fact, appearances are deceptive, and this is very interesting indeed.</p><p>We have 45/27 = 5/3 ~ 2, and so we locate our generator by 1/3 &lt; 3/8<br/>&lt; 2/5. This gives us -2, -3, -2, 3, -2 for our generator steps to odd<br/>primes; the factor of 9 gives us 18, 27, 27, 36, 63 for complexity up<br/>to 11, which is enough to show that this isn&apos;t what I find<br/>interesting. Between 1/3 and 3/8 we have (1+3)/(3+8) = 4/11 = 36/99,<br/>and between 4/11 and 3/8 we have (4+3)/(11+8) = 7/19 = 63/171,<br/>suggesting a relationship between this generator and the<br/>171-division, and the possibility of getting an excellent temperament<br/>for the 7-limit. Looking in the vicinity of 4/11 at denominators less<br/>than 75, we find</p><p>4/11 &lt;&lt; 11/30 &lt; 18/49 &lt; 25/68 &lt; 7/19 &lt;&lt; 3/8,</p><p>and multiplying numerators and denominators by 9 gives us</p><p>36/99 &lt;&lt; 99/270 &lt; 162/441 &lt; 225/612 &lt; 63/171 &lt;&lt; 27/72;</p><p>this seems to be the miraculous set of generators I thought I had<br/>found before. All of these have -2, -3, -2 for the generators of 3,<br/>5, and 7, 441 and 270 share 14 as a generator for 11, and 171, 612,<br/>441 and 270 all have 9 as a generator for 13. While the full power of<br/>this therefore can&apos;t be used by a 72-temperament, since 72/9 = 8, it<br/>does show us that we can temper the 72-et so as to get very accurate<br/>3, 5, and 7s using this generator--and that we could also temper 99<br/>and 171, so as to get some excellent 13 and 11 harmonies as well.</p></div><h3><a id=29241 href="#29241">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>10/17/2001 4:56:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9qjmvi+11beq@eGroups.com">9qjmvi+11beq@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; I sorted the generators using goodness of the white+black keys in the<br/>&gt; 11-limit, and as might be expected the miracle system of 41+31 came<br/>&gt; out on top.
