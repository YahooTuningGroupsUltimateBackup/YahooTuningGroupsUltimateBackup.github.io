At least, you should<br/>make sure &quot;Arabic&quot; is always placed in scare-quotes.</p><p>Ignoring the 7-approximation, I&apos;ve been calling these &quot;meantone-like<br/>neutral third scales&quot;.  That&apos;s because they combine the syntonic comma<br/>81:80 with the 11-limit neutral third comma 243:242.  This doesn&apos;t cover<br/>the approximation to 7.  But then it doesn&apos;t figure in the neutral-third<br/>diatonics (the mohajira- and rast-like 7 note scales).</p><p>So, my preferences for terminology:</p><p>&quot;Neutral third scales&quot; for neutral third MOS scales, or the 7-note scales<br/>that are subsets of the 10-note neutral third MOS and contain the same<br/>steps as the 7-note neutral third MOS but in a different order.</p><p>&quot;Septimally double-positive scales&quot; as a rough synonym for &quot;neutral third<br/>scales&quot; but without the implication that a neutral third be treated as an<br/>approximation to 11:9.</p><p>&quot;Meantone-like neutral third scales/temperament&quot; for scales with a neutral<br/>third of 11:9 that also temper out 81:80.</p><p>&quot;Septimally double-positive temperament&quot; for the temperament common to 24,<br/>31, 38 and 55-equal, including the approximation to 7.</p><p>&quot;Neutral third diatonics&quot; for the 7-note neutral third scales, implying<br/>the meantone-like approximation.</p><p>&quot;Mohajira-like&quot; and &quot;rast-like&quot; for the 7-note neutral third MOS and the<br/>other 7-note neutral third scale respectively, regardless of the tonic.</p><p>&quot;7++&quot; pronounced &quot;seven plus plus&quot; as a synonym for &quot;septimally<br/>double-positive&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Arabic scales&quot; for scales actually being used in Arabic music.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been playing with the 31-et version of Arabic diatonic and it<br/>&gt; seems pretty good, concordance-wise.</p><p>The 24-equal version may be better, I&apos;ve never really decided.  The fifths<br/>are better, and help reign in everything else.  The neutral thirds are<br/>also good.  The major and minor thirds are no worse than people are used<br/>to.  The 11:8 is better, and the neutral second becomes a clear 12:11<br/>instead of a wishy-washy compromise between 12:11 and 11:10.  As I said<br/>above, you don&apos;t need 7.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3><a id=32892 href="#32892">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/17/2002 5:27:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:memo.18765@cix.compulink.co.uk">memo.18765@cix.compulink.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>Gene:<br/>&gt; &gt; Would you buy the temperament of 81/80, 121/120 and 6144/6125 as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Arabic&quot;?
