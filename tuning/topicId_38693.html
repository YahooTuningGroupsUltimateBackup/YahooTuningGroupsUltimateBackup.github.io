There is a huge list of gigantic posts that I wish to respond to<br/>(Paul, Margo, David Doty, Christopher Bailey, and now Kyle Gann, and others!),<br/>but I have to take time out. I&apos;m back in Boston, but have gone from a situation<br/>where I was very interested in the dialogues here, but also was living with my<br/>mother-in-law in Greece, hadn&apos;t enough &quot;space&quot; to compose, and therefore needed<br/>some kind of digression, to being still very interested in the dialogues here but now<br/>being able to compose and having an end-of-July deadline to finish a piece.</p><p>If any of you are still interested in my thoughts a few weeks from now, then I&apos;ll be<br/>happy to continue the discussion. I don&apos;t want anyone to think I&apos;m avoiding my<br/>responsibilities apropos of my essay...</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>-Julia</p></div>
