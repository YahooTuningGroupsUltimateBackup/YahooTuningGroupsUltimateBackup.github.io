Sorry about this.</p><p>If you remember, I excluded the actual archive itself from<br/>search engines in my robots.txt file, but made the index<br/>page accessible. This is important as the informal<br/>remarks in the archive aren&apos;t meant for &quot;publication&quot;<br/>so not suitable for the first page one gets to in the<br/>search results.</p><p>What I hadn&apos;t realised is that the root directory for<br/>ftp upload isn&apos;t the same as the root directory for<br/>the server, just a sub directory.</p><p>To work in permanent fashion, should be in the server root<br/>directory, which I think wouldn&apos;t have been accessible for<br/>a user, only to nbci themselves.</p><p>I tried the temporary deletion of all the search results, which one<br/>can do even if the robots.txt isn&apos;t in the root directory,<br/>but that didn&apos;t work either.</p><p>This may mean that the robots.txt file should have included<br/>the tunesmithy subdirectory in all the paths.</p><p>At least, I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s what has happened,<br/>though I have just sent an e-mail to Google recently to find out more.</p><p>A possible solution is to add the exclude information individually to each<br/>page in meta tags, which my archive program could easily do.</p><p>However, unfortunately, my nbci account has been closed for<br/>ftp uploads (along with all the nbci accounts), and I can<br/>no longer ftp to it. Presumably they will delete all the files<br/>there eventually, but are taking a while to get round to doing so.</p><p>Once they are deleted, I can remove them immediately from Google<br/>using their immediate removal tool - which one can use to update<br/>the results and cached pages for pages that are no longer there,<br/>if one so wishes.</p><p>Obviously Google have to protect web owners from anyone else<br/>who wants to remove someone&apos;s pages from the web, and they<br/>do this by making it dependent on the robots.txt file that<br/>one uploads by ftp, or the page not being there at all.</p><p>Sorry about all this. I may see if I can get nbci to delete<br/>the pages early, though this will mean the archive won&apos;t be<br/>available on-line for a while as I haven&apos;t yet organised<br/>another site for it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2001 3:00:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert -- I consider that a VERY GOOD thing.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/1/2001 3:43:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Robert -- I consider that a VERY GOOD thing.</p><p>It led me here; if that is a good or a bad thing I leave to<br/>individual taste.</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/1/2001 3:44:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27774">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27774</a></p><p>&gt; Robert -- I consider that a VERY GOOD thing.</p><p>Actually, *I* have not problem with it either...
