Maybe not, but it _is_ possible to generate just pitches by<br/>changing the frequency operators of the FM synthesis. Some interesting<br/>melodies can be played after saving piano/flute sounds with frequency<br/>retuned to 7, 8, 10, 11 and 13 in the five banks of user timbres. This gives<br/>five 12TET scales separated by just intervals. If you consider 12TET to be<br/>3-limit, the resulting 13-limit lattice is fun to explore.</p><p>MOS - Rothenberg - Balzano property:<br/>Has anyone studied this from an information theory perspective? The more<br/>unique intervals there are in a scale, the more &quot;information&quot; in would<br/>contain.</p><p>Microtones on MTV:<br/>The flute obstinato at the end of Eminem&apos;s &quot;The real slim shady&quot; is<br/>microtonal.<br/>9/4 2/1 3/2 4/3 21/16 7/6 9/8 1/1</p><p>Neural networks:<br/>Do you know of any musical uses for Neural Networks? Maybe giving<br/>scales/chords in input to a Kohonen Map would generate some pretty looking<br/>patterns. What classification (of chords or scales) would emerge as the<br/>result of unsupervised learning? Since NN&apos;s are good approximaters, maybe<br/>this classification/property would be a generalisation of the concept of<br/>&quot;pitch class.&quot;</p><p>-Kami</p></div><h3><a id=11257 href="#11257">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2000 7:49:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;MOS - Rothenberg - Balzano property:<br/>&gt;Has anyone studied this from an information theory perspective?</p><p>Rothenberg has; he makes cryptic remarks about it in his papers, including<br/>one spot where he criticizes previous efforts to apply information theory<br/>to music:</p><p>&quot;Much confusion has resulted from the application of standard statistical<br/>&apos;redundancy&apos; measures to musical &apos;messages&apos; without considering the<br/>limitations introduced by the efficiency of the code being used.&quot;</p><p>&gt;The more unique intervals there are in a scale, the more &quot;information&quot; in<br/>&gt;would contain.</p><p>One important feature of the Rothenberg model is that it postulates that<br/>listeners construct reference frames to extract information from music.<br/>So, we have three places to look: the music, the scale, and the reference<br/>frame.  Then, we must ask what we want.  Do we want to maximize the amount<br/>of information in any one of these?  Random tone generation has far more<br/>information than normal music, but most listeners would not prefer it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
