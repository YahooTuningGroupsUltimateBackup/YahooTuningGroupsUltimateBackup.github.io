I&apos;ve been looking up user<br/>reviews at Harmony Central and SonicState and there seem to be a lot<br/>of complaints about bug-ridden ASR-X&apos;s.  To be fair, most of those<br/>reviews seem to have been posted before version 2.67 of its software.</p><p>My main electronic instrument is the Roland Handsonic hand percussion<br/>instrument.  The internal sound engine is basically a ROM sample<br/>player with effects and tuning capability to 1 cent resolution.  Just<br/>intonation is also the way I am going.  There are no global tuning<br/>tables so it would be a real pain to switch between different JI<br/>tunings (Wendy Carlos, Catler, Pagano, etc.), meantone, various ETs,<br/>etc. as I&apos;d have to program an entire pad set for each tuning.  I<br/>figure something like the ASR-X with its one user table and multiple<br/>preset tuning tables (Partch 43 tone JI, 31t-ET, etc.) might be an<br/>inevitable addition to my setup.  If I&apos;m convinced it won&apos;t break<br/>down in a couple of months. :)</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=15039 href="#15039">ðŸ”—</a>Justin White &#x3C;justin.white@davidjones.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2000 12:27:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message: 16<br/>   Date: Tue, 24 Oct 2000 15:25:10 -0700<br/>   From: Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Wilson CPS</p><p>&gt;Justin !<br/>&gt;    Are you treating this set as octave specific or are you &gt;reducing the<br/>into a single octave?</p><p>&gt;This is quite a large set and some of the tones (21, 27) can &gt;be thought<br/>of as 3*7 and 3*9.

I liked the idea of local consonance on specific<br/>&gt;chords rather than a tonality diamond system where everything refers to 1/1<br/>&gt;as the key center.</p><p>Have you looked much at lattices? Almost any random blob of the lattice will<br/>give you lots of locally consonant, specific chords. The hexany is just one<br/>specific chunk that happens to have the symmetrical, octahedral shape. The<br/>entire infinite 7-limit lattice is composed of interlocking hexanies and<br/>tetrads, so a big chunk of the 7-limit lattice will get you lots of both.<br/>Alternately, you can look at the 7-limit lattice as being composed of<br/>interlocking hexanies and diamonds, so a big chunk of the 7-limit lattice<br/>will get you lots of both. Now if you want to use as large a set of pitches<br/>from the lattice as you can, while restricting yourself to pitches that are<br/>not too close to one another, the type of &quot;blob&quot; you end up with is almost<br/>certainly going to be a periodicity block. See<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a>. A great number of<br/>7-limit periodicity blocks have 31 notes, and very few have some other<br/>number of notes between 30 and 40. If you want to reach further into the<br/>lattice, tempering out one or more of the three commas that define the block<br/>can help while necessitating only very tiny departures from JI. If you<br/>temper out all three commas, you get 31-tone equal temperament or a 31-tone<br/>well-temperament.</p><p>&gt;What you are suggesting could well be the answer I am looking for.<br/>&gt;However I don&apos;t know how to stellate.</p><p>We&apos;ve gone over this on the list but I don&apos;t think starting with a CPS is<br/>really going to best address your desires here.</p><p>&gt;( I heard a reference to the<br/>&gt;Mill college site is this where they are located ?)</p><p>All the discussions since late Dec. &apos;98 are archived right here, on the<br/>egroups site.
