It takes<br/>at least three pitches before either otonality or utonality can be said to be predominate<br/>over the other. It is truly a special feature of utonalities, though, that 3 or more notes from<br/>a utonality will tend to have one (1) fairly low overtone (harmonic) in common. Whether<br/>this has any audible bearing on music . . . well, that&apos;s a matter of debate.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2005 1:47:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mohajeri Shahin&quot; &lt;shahinm@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I myself guess that the first is otonal.
