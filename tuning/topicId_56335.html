Here are my requirements:</p><p>- capable of making user-defined tabulature (which I want to use for pieces performed using a MIDI controller)<br/>- capable of handling various microtonal notation schemes (since I don&apos;t know yet which one(s) I&apos;ll use)<br/>- runs on Windows XP (I have both Cygwin and Mingw, so I can still use a halfway sane environment)<br/>- free (preferably) or cheap<br/>- a decent UI is a plus, but editing text is fine too</p><p>Will lilypond do the trick?  Do I have to bite the bullet and consider Finale (not my first choice due to expense and one of the worst UI designs I&apos;ve ever seen)?</p><p>I already have and love Noteworthy (which is great for writing in 12-note schemes and generating MIDI files that I can then retune with Scala) but it doesn&apos;t do tab or non-standard accidentals.</p><p>Thanks all.</p><p>- Dave</p></div>
