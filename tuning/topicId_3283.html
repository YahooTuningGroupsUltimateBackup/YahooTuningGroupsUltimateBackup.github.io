The prevalence of the diatonic scale (or close<br/>approximations to it) in music having its roots in the European Classical<br/>tradition is probably a direct consequence of the evolution of medieval<br/>plainsong chants in structures (monasteries and cathedrals) having long<br/>reverberation times.  These chants only &quot;work&quot; in such an environment if all<br/>of the notes of the scale are consonant with the reverberations of<br/>previously sounded notes.  Simply singing a just diatonic scale in such an<br/>environment creates beautiful harmonies.</p><p>&#x9;I was made aware of this during the pre-concert warmup of<br/>Philomusica Chamber Choir singing in St Ignatius Church in Rome a few years<br/>ago.  As we began to sing our scales, we were pleasantly surprised by the<br/>effect produced when our voices were joined by those of the &quot;virtual&quot; choir<br/>created by the long reverberation time.   In the concert we found that both<br/>the Gregorian Chants and the Palestrina Mass worked extremely well, however,<br/>more modern pieces had to be considerably slowed down to avoid turning into<br/>meaningless noise.</p><p>&#x9;It would probably be a good idea for those planning concerts of<br/>microtonal music to consider the acoustic environment a bit more carefully.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Clif Ashcraft</p></div>
