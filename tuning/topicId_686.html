Polansky as a possible xen<br/>guitarist. Seth Josel cinfirmed this, and then so did Larry.<br/>He plays a fretless electric.</p><p>&gt;I tried to listen to it and it said my player was wrong...i know it&apos;s not,<br/>&gt;so it must be their site.<br/>&gt;<br/>Dang.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And there&apos;s a page for this here (all Turkish)<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://sinema.tr-net.net.tr/movies/eskiya/cast/erkan_ogur.htm">http://sinema.tr-net.net.tr/movies/eskiya/cast/erkan_ogur.htm</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I saw the page and was amazed by the fretless STEINBERGER in the page. It is<br/>&gt;amazing. Wish i had one...or two.<br/>Very nice. Double neck job (one necks seems 12-EDO).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hopefully perhaps we can get some info from the man himself.<br/>&gt;It would be<br/>&gt;good to know what he&apos;s been up too since being in GP in 92.<br/>Which had him holding a very nice looking Gibson SG fretless.</p><p>Oh, and about Hansford Rowe, I found this bit of info :</p><p>&quot;He plays WARWICK bass guitars and has worked<br/>closely with them on the development of the first Just Intonation bass.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve found tons of stuff that I&apos;m itching to get out onto the WWW ASAP.<br/>I&apos;m behind schedule, but should be done anyday now.</p><p>- Drew</p></div>
