Why not<br/>&gt; explain it on the list?</p><p>I will see below:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The first problem I ran into is that you seem to assume<br/>&gt; there are recognizable 5ths and 4ths.</p><p>In meantone, there is usually little dispute about where the fifth (and hence the fourth) is located - (generally the interval nearest to 700 cents).<br/>In many others, it is also usually clear.<br/>For those tunings which are ambiguous or derived from an entirely &quot;alien&quot; mapping; the same principle could be applied by specifying the reference for the chain.<br/>Chains could be shown from any reference interval, it just happens to be convenient to use the fifth for meantones and many others.</p><p>Format of scalecdoing is : x/m1m2..../T<br/>x= The expanse i.e. the number of steps along the chain of fourthsand fifths from the flatmos fourth note to the sharpmost fifth for each scale.<br/>m1m2 etc. = position of missing notes.<br/>T = Tonic.</p><p>This is an example of how it works for a meantone-type tuning; and can be applied to any 5 Large 2 small interval = an octave, and produces a unique and unambiguous result<br/>in both directions - from notenames to coding; and coding to notenames.</p><p>e.g. scale coding is 9/389/7<br/>Notes in ascending pitch order = C-Db-Eb-F-Gb-A-Bb<br/>Arranged in chain of fifths - left to right = Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A<br/>Chain is of ten notes i.e. 9 steps (from Gb to A)<br/>Notes in positions 3 (Ab), 8 (G) and 9 (D) are missing<br/>The Tonic is note in position  7 (C)</p><p>To analyse a collection of notes.</p><p>1. List all the different notes which are used in the piece regardless of octave.</p><p>2. Arrange the note names in order of fourths (flats) in one direction and fifths (sharps) in the other, leaving blank spaces where notes are missing. [Sequence ascending in fifths is: Bbb Fb Cb Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E# B# F## C## etc.] The fifth may be considered as the dominant, and the fourth as the sub-dominant.</p><p>3. Count the total number of steps between the fourthmost (flat) and fifthmost (sharp) note. This is the extent of the string, or chain of fourths/fifths (x).</p><p>4. List the missing notes. Identify them by numbering the flatmost as 1 and the following as ascending numbers moving through fifths. Each of the missing notes may be defined as between 2 and x.</p><p>5. The megamode may now be defined by the number of steps and the position of the missing notes (m1, m2, etc.). Eg. x=12 m1=2; m2=5; m3=9; and m4=11. Therefore there are four notes missing in the sequence. The extent is (x)=12. So there are thirteen notes of which four (m1 to m4) are missing leaving 13-4 = 9 notes. In this case numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12. 6.</p><p>6.The mode is determined by which of the notes is chosen as the start of a sequence of ascending frequencies. This starting note may be identified by stating its position on the chain of fifths. For example, if the notes were six consecutive steps (Eg. F C G D A E B); these pitches could be arranged in seven modes of different ascending pitch orders.</p><p>5. The megamode may now be defined by the number of steps and the position of the missing notes (m1, m2, etc.). Eg. x=12 m1=2; m2=5; m3=9; and m4=11. Therefore there are four notes missing in the sequence. The extent is (x)=12. So there are thirteen notes of which four (m1 to m4) are missing leaving 13-4 = 9 notes. In this case numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12. 6.</p><p>6.The mode is determined by which of the notes is chosen as the start of a sequence of ascending frequencies. This starting note may be identified by stating its position on the chain of fifths. For example, if the notes were six consecutive steps (Eg. F C G D A E B); these pitches could be arranged in seven modes of different ascending pitch orders.</p><p>7. The key of the scale and scale is determined by the tonal center, which may defined as C,D,E,F,G,A, or B with the appropriate sharps or flats. The scale may then be listed in ascending frequency order by note name.</p><p>8. A scale or mode may therefore be defined as: Number of steps in chain (x)/position(s) of missing notes (counted from fourths towards fifths)/Position of tonic (counted from fourths towards fifths). Eg. The scale and mode described as 5/25/3 could give the notes F-G-D-E from the chain F-C-G-D-A-E. Using the third note of the chain (G) as the starting note giving a scale of G-D-E-F or the mode of I-V-VI-bVII.</p><p>N.B. This system is for Octave Ratio = 2.<br/>5 large + 2 small intervals = one octave.</p><p>In the following comments please realise that I am thinking about this from a meantone perspective.</p><p>Nevertheless I believe that developments from this type of system can be applied to JI, equal temperaments, and multi-dimensional patterns.</p><p>Now I need to start thinking/working.<br/>Within the next few days I intend to post my initial proposals for a similar system which can also embrace other types of tuning systems:<br/>to classify them and devise a coding for the scales that they can produce.</p><p>To cover:<br/>Various other quantities of two interval sizes per octave.

I propose a small set of clear and<br/>logical terms that correspond with universal (among EDOs, anyway)<br/>scale shapes.  Scalecoding is a quasi-mathematical formula that gives<br/>you a mode-specific string of numbers that tells you...what?  I cannot<br/>see how this would be useful in composition or in comparing tunings.<br/>All it gives you is a string of numbers to identify a mode of a<br/>particular scale that uses a given interval as a generator, in what I<br/>would call a very non-intuitive way.  What, do you think, the average<br/>musician would find easier: learning the definitions of a few terms<br/>that refer to a scale shape, or learning this very abstract formula of<br/>yours?  Just because your method makes reference to &quot;chains of<br/>fifths/fourths&quot; and works with conventional notation does not<br/>necessarily make it easier.</p><p>&gt; This is an example of how it works for a meantone-type tuning; and<br/>&gt; can be applied to any 5 Large 2 small interval = an octave, and<br/>&gt; produces a unique and unambiguous result<br/>&gt; in both directions - from notenames to coding; and coding to<br/>&gt; notenames.</p><p>Assuming, of course, that you know what notenames to use!  For most of<br/>the tunings I use/am interested in, the note-naming varies depending<br/>on what scale I am using.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; e.g. scale coding is 9/389/7<br/>&gt; Notes in ascending pitch order = C-Db-Eb-F-Gb-A-Bb<br/>&gt; Arranged in chain of fifths - left to right = Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A<br/>&gt; Chain is of ten notes i.e. 9 steps (from Gb to A)<br/>&gt; Notes in positions 3 (Ab), 8 (G) and 9 (D) are missing<br/>&gt; The Tonic is note in position  7 (C)</p><p>So let me get this straight: you list the notes in a piece according<br/>to a given note-naming system.  Then you arrange them into a chain of<br/>generators, fill in the blanks, and assign ordinality to each number.<br/> Then you make the scalecode which is based on how long the chain of<br/>generators is, which notes are missing from it, and which note is the<br/>&quot;tonic&quot; (presumably if you were using an atonal scale you would leave<br/>that one blank)?</p><p>For this to be universal, you would have to also include in the<br/>scalecode: the generating interval, the naming system, and the type of<br/>tuning system (EDO, ED-nonO, circulating, JI etc.).  There is nothing<br/>inherent in the code that tells you the shape of the scale without<br/>first actually writing out the scale, unless you memorize all the codes.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nevertheless I believe that developments from this type of system can<br/>&gt; be applied to JI, equal temperaments, and multi-dimensional patterns.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I need to start thinking/working.</p><p>Good luck!  Considering that most JI scales I have seen on this board<br/>are indeed multidimensional (not using a single generator but rather a<br/>CPS/tonality diamond).  I think that once you have accomplished making<br/>this system universal, it will be so complex that it will defeat your<br/>previous goal of &quot;not wanting to overwhelm the non-microtonalist with<br/>too much math&quot;.  But as I have said, we all must do what works for us.<br/> If scalecoding floats your boat, more power to you!  In the meantime,<br/>I will pursue my (very simple) naming of scale families.</p><p>Best,</p><p>_igs</p></div><h3><a id=60462 href="#60462">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 2:33:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Considering that most JI scales I have seen on this board<br/>&gt; are indeed multidimensional (not using a single generator but rather a<br/>&gt; CPS/tonality diamond).</p><p>I agree that most JI scales posted here don&apos;t use a single generator,<br/>and a few have been CPSs, and a few have been tonality diamonds, but<br/>most have been neither CPSs nor tonality diamonds.</p></div><h3><a id=60465 href="#60465">ðŸ”—</a>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 3:24:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I agree that most JI scales posted here don&apos;t use a single generator,<br/>&gt; and a few have been CPSs, and a few have been tonality diamonds, but<br/>&gt; most have been neither CPSs nor tonality diamonds.</p><p>Okay, gross over generalization on my part, as I left out harmonic<br/>series and means that I am not familiar with.
