By &quot;propriety&quot; we&apos;ve been referring to Rotherberg<br/>propriety, which means that specific interval size is a monotonic increasing<br/>function of generic interval size. For example, the 7-tone Pythagorean scale<br/>is not proper because the diminished fifth is smaller than the augmented<br/>fourth. The reason I brought that up is that Jason Yust was looking for<br/>generators that give Rothenberg-proper scales most often in the process of<br/>stacking them to form larger and larger scales.</p><p>&gt;For the moment, I suggest you look at these<br/>&gt;figures :</p><p>&gt;<a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/majmin1.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/majmin1.gif</a><br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/majmin2.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/majmin2.gif</a></p><p>I&apos;m sure there is much of great interest encapsulated in these diagrams, but<br/>from a musical and historical standpoint, I must note that the &quot;major mode&quot;<br/>of Ptolemy&apos;s Intense Diatonic, or your &quot;gamme de Zarlino&quot;, is essentially a<br/>fiction. At no point in the history of Western music, with the possible<br/>exception of a Pythagorean schismatic approximation (i.e., using Pythagorean<br/>diminished fourths to approximate 5:4s and augmented seconds to approximate<br/>6:5s) used around 1420, did this scale have any importance whatsoever.<br/>Zarlino may have referred to it as a conceptual ideal, but in practice he<br/>proposed using 2/7-comma meantone temperament to overcome its shortcomings<br/>-- most glaringly, its out-of-tune ii chord.</p><p>&gt;With mystical preoccupations of Pythagore, the most<br/>&gt;consonant tones {5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3} were identified to {81/64, 4/3, 3/2,<br/>&gt;27/16} to fit mathematical presupposition on the number 3.</p><p>Ouch -- we may have to rehash some lengthy arguments already in the archives<br/>here, but suffice it to say that by all musicological indications, until<br/>5-limit consonances began to be used in the 15th century and became the norm<br/>in the 16th century, medieval Western music used thirds and sixths as<br/>dissonances and valued their unstable quality in order to power the<br/>resolutions to fifths, fourths, and octaves in which they were involved. For<br/>those purposes, 81:64 and 27:16 are quite appropriate intervals, though one<br/>would not notice if they were out-of-tune (in fact those Medieval theorists<br/>who proposed latering these thirds and sixths suggested sizes that were<br/>_further_ from the simple 5-limit ratios, rather than closer to them).<br/>Morover, the &quot;major&quot; or &quot;Ionian&quot; mode was among the least used of the modes<br/>in Medieval times, so your argument seems to fail on that basis as well.</p><p>&gt;The definition of &quot;proper mode of a set of tones&quot; or &quot;mode in a set of<br/>&gt;tones&quot; distinguish, first, factorizable tones (by inferior tones in the<br/>set)<br/>&gt;and prime tones. All the tones are prime in {9/8, 5/4, 3/2}. Only 5/4 is<br/>&gt;factorizable in {10/9, 9/8, 5/4, 3/2}. If there exist, in a set of tones, a<br/>&gt;chain of prime tones connecting 1 and 2, it&apos;s a proper mode of the set (by<br/>&gt;definition). The tones (1 4/3 3/2 2) are a mode in the set {1, 9/8, 4/3,<br/>3/2}<br/>&gt;corresponding to the chain of prime tones 4/3 9/8 4/3.</p><p>I&apos;m confused by this theory and what justification you could have for it,<br/>but go on. Note, though, that the term &quot;proper&quot; is liable to be confused<br/>with the Rothenberg propriety mentioned above.</p><p>&gt;It seems to me that good scales result of balance between consonance and<br/>&gt;coherence.</p><p>On that we can agree. However, by restricting yourself to JI scales (with<br/>pure, untempered ratios), you&apos;re missing many interesting possibilities<br/>here, including the ones which have been important to Western music since<br/>1500 (even the schismatic Pythagorean tuning of c.1420 mentioned earlier has<br/>its consonant relationship best understood by considering it conceptually as<br/>a schismatic temperament, say one where the fifth is tempered by 1/8 to 1/9<br/>schisma).</p></div>
