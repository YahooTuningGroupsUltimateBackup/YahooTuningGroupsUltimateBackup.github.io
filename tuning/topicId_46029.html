I took this as a portent, and am posting this here so all can<br/>listen in.</p><p>Let us represent 7-limit notes by means of what I&apos;ve taken to<br/>calling &quot;monzos&quot;--row vectors of integers representing the exponents<br/>of 2, 3, 5, and 7 respectively. 1/1, which I take to be middle C, is<br/>represented by the monzo [0, 0, 0, 0], and is given the white space<br/>between the bass and treble clefs. Of notes without accidentals, only<br/>one (middle C) is allowed in this space. The white space above the<br/>treble clef is C an octave up, and below the bass clef C an octave<br/>down, and so forth. It might make more sense to choose A as the place<br/>to center on, and in any case to use ABCDEFGHI as the nine nominals;<br/>I&apos;d like opinions on that.</p><p>Let [a, b, c, d] be a monzo. The number of steps up or down from<br/>middle C--the staff line or space on which the note is located--is<br/>given by 9a + 13b + 19c + 24d. (This is an example of what I call a<br/>val.) The number of sharp symbols (if positive) or flat symbols (if<br/>negative) is given by 2b + 3c + 2d (another val.)  The sharp is a<br/>sharp of reasonable size, being about the size of the 43-et sharp. In<br/>terms of cents, we can take it to be 253/3 cents; together with 400/3<br/>cents for 1/9 of an octave, this gives us in effect a 3600-et version<br/>of ennealimmal, which happens to be a very good one.</p><p>This is the basic system, but I presume in practice it will work<br/>better to use the symbols for two or three flats and sharps, along<br/>with step adjustments. The double sharp symbol could be given the job<br/>of representing two sharps, down a step, or 2*(253/3)-400/3 = 35.33<br/>cents. The triple sharp symbol could be given the job of representing<br/>three flats *down*, and two steps up, of size therefore 2*(400/3)-3*<br/>(253/3) = 13.67 cents.</p><p>If we take the octave starting at middle C to be C, D, E, F, G, H, I,<br/>A, B, C&apos;, then 5/4 is represented as D###, which can be rendered more<br/>perspicuouly as F &quot;triple flat&quot;, or an F of 400 cents, down 13.67<br/>cents to 386.33 cents. 3/2 becomes four steps up plus two sharps, or<br/>G##; which is a G of 533.33 cents plus two sharps totaling 168.67<br/>cents, giving 702 cents; but we can also call it H &quot;double sharp&quot;, or<br/>an H of  666.67 cents up 35.33 cents to 702 cents. 7/4 is represented<br/>by I##, but again we may call that A &quot;double sharp&quot;; an A of 933.33<br/>cents up 35.33 cents to 968.67 cents. The C major tetrad is now<br/>C - F &quot;triple flat&quot; - H &quot;double sharp&quot; - A &quot;double sharp&quot;. If you<br/>compare the figures above to JI values, you will see that we are<br/>very, very close--this is, effectively, 7-limit JI.</p></div>
