And there is nothing grating other than a modern predisposition.<br/>Isacoff clearly has not heard the tuning.</p><p>This variegation a kind of perspective through audible shading was seized<br/>upon as a good thing by opponents of equal temperament, who saw in<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s system the advantage of a built-in musical syntax.<br/>-----This happens after Werckmeister and after Bach, not during the Baroque.</p><p>Changes in a piece s scales and harmonies were now overlaid with an added<br/>expressive element: a dramatic change in the quality of sound, depending on<br/>which tones the music revolved around at a given moment.<br/>-----Baroque composers were careful not to overexpose the foreign keys or<br/>chords. Here Isacoff is at the tip of the iceberg regarding its potential<br/>expressivity.</p><p>(Of course, this change would only occur on keyboard instruments; strings and<br/>woodwinds were left to pursue their own musical grammars.)<br/>-----Poppycock. Woodwinds always played, along with the strings of the<br/>Baroque, with the ever present keyboard. There is no separate grammar.</p><p>Advocates claimed for well temperament the bonus of giving each key its own<br/>character; but for many, subjecting a keyboard to gradations of in-and<br/>out-of-tuneness offered little in the way of musical value.<br/>-----This is ignorance of the value of key character. It shows up the value<br/>for melody ala the Rousseau bit since the ecstatic free nature of melody is<br/>better represented. And more in the way of musical value, not less.</p><p>Indeed, Werckmeister himself eventually became an advocate for equal<br/>temperament.<br/>-----This is a lie. Werckmeister supported his chromatic tuning throughout<br/>his entire life, as I have previously exposed on this list.</p><p>The German critic and composer Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg who, at the request<br/>of the heirs of Bach, wrote a preface for a new edition of the master&apos;s Art<br/>of Fugue offered a terse critique of the well-tempered system in 1776:<br/>Diversity in the character of the keys, he wrote, will serve only to increase<br/>a diversity of bad sounds in the performance.<br/>-----Marpurg was the director of the lottery and a bitter man. He is writing<br/>against Kirnberger (who was supported by CPE Bach and others).</p><p>There is controversy to this day over whether Bach preferred equal or well<br/>temperament. Some theorists contend that there is internal evidence in his<br/>music differences in the way he handled different keys to suggest he had well<br/>temperament in mind.<br/>-----Yet there is little by Isacoff to represent the other side fairly.</p><p>(One modern scholar insists that he has broken the code of Bach&apos;s secret<br/>tuning by unraveling the images in the composer s personal seal, which<br/>contained seven points and five dashes. However, his secret solution<br/>conflicts with statements about temperament made by musicians in Bach&apos;s<br/>circle.)<br/>-----Rather crude not to mention Herbert s name. Why not indicate what<br/>conflicts there were with statements in Bach&apos;s circle?</p><p>There is as much evidence on the other side: Bach&apos;s biographer Johann<br/>Nikolaus Forkel reported, for example, that Bach moved so subtly through the<br/>keys that listeners never noticed the change; this suggests equal<br/>temperament.<br/>-----And yet Forkel is one of the clearest that Bach is not equal<br/>temperament. None of this proves that Bach used anything different than<br/>Werckmeister. Only Isacoff is suggesting ET.</p><p>His obituary made a similar comment about the artful way in which he tuned<br/>his instruments<br/>-----And tuning Werckmeister is MUCH faster than tuning 12-tET</p><p>What s more, Bach used two different spellings of a single key for paired<br/>pieces in his Well-Tempered Clavier, as if to announce that he considered<br/>re-sharp and mi-flat equal.</p><p>Just couldn&apos;t let this pass, best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=35578 href="#35578">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 5:53:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_35563.html#35563">/tuning/topicId_35563.html#35563</a></p><p>&gt; What s more, Bach used two different spellings of a single key for<br/>paired pieces in his Well-Tempered Clavier, as if to announce that he<br/>considered re-sharp and mi-flat equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just couldn&apos;t let this pass, best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>****Hi Johnny!</p><p>You refuted ably all the points except the very last one.
