The _Live at Pompeii_ video comes highly recommended. My<br/>favorite Floyd album might be _Animals_ if I ever got to listen to it<br/>all the way through.</p><p>Here is a brief review of all the Pink Floyd albums from _The<br/>Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock_ (my trusted choice):</p><p>&quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (67), A Saucerful of Secrets (68),<br/>More (69), Ummagumma (69), Atom Heart Mother (70), Relics (71),<br/>Meddle (71), Obscured by Clouds (72), The Dark Side of the Moon (73),<br/>A Nice Pair (73, first two albums repackaged), Wish You Were Here<br/>(75), Animals (77), The Wall (79), A Collection of Great Dance Songs<br/>(81, comp.), The Final Cut (83), Works (83, comp. of early material),<br/>A Momentary Lapse of Reason (87), A Delicate Sound of Thunder (89),<br/>Shine On (92, boxed set), The Division Bell (94), Pulse (96)</p><p>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn - Nice, dreamy, surrealistic,<br/>storybookish, childlike (but not childish) type stuff. Syd Barrett<br/>was the band&apos;s leader for this one, and it has a distinctively<br/>different touch from anything that followed. A Saucerful of Secrets -<br/>Barrett&apos;s gone now. This music continues in sort of the same vein,<br/>but harder-edged. The showcase of the album is the title cut, a sort-<br/>of avant-garde type piece everyone needs to hear. Ummagumma - A two-<br/>record set. The first record consists of live performances, all of<br/>which are, in my opinion, improvements over the studio versions. The<br/>guys stretch out with some psychedelic jams. The second record gives<br/>each member of the band a half-side to do anything he wants, all by<br/>himself. Kind of interesting to see what they did--some of it&apos;s<br/>pretty off-the-wall stuff, especially Waters&apos; &quot;Several Small<br/>Species...&quot; - but the live record is what justifies the album.<br/>Soundtrack to More (not sure of date, but pretty sure it belongs<br/>here). Something a completist would want, but the casual listener<br/>could put it at the bottom of his music-to-buy list. Atom Heart<br/>Mother -- the title track is a side-long suite, complete with<br/>orchestra, a bluesey guitar solo, electronic effects, a section that<br/>could only be described as (and I know how ridiculous this sounds) a<br/>choir scat-singing, and ... well, the kitchen sink. In terms of pure<br/>inventiveness, probably their standout piece. Meddle - Another side-<br/>long epic, &quot;Echoes.&quot; It&apos;s not the large-scale composition the AHM<br/>Suite is; rather, &quot;Echoes&quot; is more like an extended song: intro, two<br/>verses, bridge with solos, third verse, and they&apos;re off to lunch. The<br/>other side is mostly accoustic-type stuff, very nicely done, and also<br/>contains the rather intense &quot;One of these Days.&quot; Obscured by Clouds -<br/>See comments for More; however, this album would be slightly higher<br/>on your list. Dark Side of the Moon - I suppose this is the &quot;turning<br/>point&quot; Floyd album. Waters&apos; domination over the band began to really<br/>kick in here. For the first time, we see a whole albums&apos; worth of<br/>lyrics that show a sad, cynical outlook on the world. Fortunately,<br/>Waters still had some poetry in him at this point, and the music<br/>itself is gorgeous. Wish You Were Here - Their tribute to Syd<br/>Barrett. Poignant, even sad, this album captures in its lyrics and<br/>music the sense of life&apos;s quiet tragedies. The only negative thing is<br/>that there are a couple places where the music seems to ramble on a<br/>bit too long. If not for that, I could almost consider this a perfect<br/>album. Animals - In my opinion, their most &quot;progressive&quot; album. What<br/>I particularly like about this one is that Waters and Co. managed to<br/>get some fascinating, innovative, evocative music recorded without<br/>doing anything that was truly weird. (Oh, yeah, some barking dogs.<br/>Big deal.) Weird is okay, actually, but to get the same effect<br/>without weirdness is a major accomplishment. The poetry I mentioned<br/>that Waters had in him four years earlier is now wearing thin; the<br/>metaphor of people-as-animals isn&apos;t exactly fresh. And he puts the<br/>idea across with &quot;the subtle touch of the sledge hammer,&quot; as some of<br/>my writer friends sometimes say. What saves the album, lyrically, is<br/>that this idea just happens to be one that&apos;s possibly better off<br/>treated this way. The Wall - Overblown, self-pitying &quot;World War II<br/>was a world-wide conspiracy to deprive me of my father&apos; BS. This is<br/>not to belittle the tragedies of war and/or the loss of fathers. It<br/>can make for compelling subject matter. But notice I said &quot;can.&quot; Any<br/>subject matter, no matter how important or compellingly tragic, can<br/>be given a treatment that would make even the most indulgent listener<br/>want to slap the songwriter around and shout, &quot;WHO CARES???&quot; To be<br/>honest, I don&apos;t see much effort on Waters&apos; part to actually write<br/>lyrics; many of the songs seem not to be much more than notes for an<br/>autobiographical story or an essay. To be fair, though, it does have<br/>some nice moments--mostly on the songs Gilmour co-wrote - but I can&apos;t<br/>imagine listening to all four sides at once. The Final Cut - more of<br/>The Wall, only not as interesting. Wake me when it&apos;s over. A<br/>Momentary Lapse of Reason - Waters is gone now, leaving the<br/>leadership role to Gilmour. This album has some nice Pink Floyd style<br/>pop music, which puts it ahead of most of what you hear on the radio.<br/>Unfortunately, many of us who were seriously into the band in the mid-<br/>70&apos;s or earlier have to just shake our heads and mutter, &quot;Surely they<br/>can do better than this..&quot; Delicate Sound of Thunder - The live album<br/>from the Momentary Lapse tour. I didn&apos;t bother with it. The Division<br/>Bell shows little recovery from the Momentary Lapse decline and is of<br/>little interest to those not in the grip of the Floydian dogma.&quot;</p><p>I know that Pulse is a very fine live album with no new compositions,<br/>I think.</p></div><h3><a id=21625 href="#21625">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/25/2001 9:07:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21239.html#21619">/tuning/topicId_21239.html#21619</a></p><p>Thanks, Paul, for your Pink Floyd compendium...
