A real winner.</p><p>Only a couple of questionably tuned notes popped out at me (though<br/>just barely noticeable because they&apos;re moving by pretty fast):</p><p>- Beat 154:4:469, an A-C tuned at 377.5 cents</p><p>- Beat 156:4:357, Eb-G-Bb-C# with the Eb-G at 420.1 cents (the Bb-C#<br/>is a near-just 313.2 cents so perhaps that&apos;s what the program chose to<br/>tune)</p><p>- Also beat 57:4:198, an A-C#-F where A-C# and F-A are just 387.7<br/>cents leaving a wide C#-F at 424.7 cents.  So I guess my ear wants to<br/>hear 12-equal temperament at that point</p><p>The horizontal pitch relationships in the 7-limit version are still<br/>too wild for me, although there are a number of points in the 5-limit<br/>version where I&apos;d love to hear septimal chord tunings.  I may try<br/>just dropping some 7&apos;s judiciously into the already horizontally<br/>well-tuned 5-limit version and see whether that works for me (perhaps<br/>mainly in block chords where the 7&apos;s won&apos;t play a prominent melodic<br/>role).</p><p>Also an aside on the topic of tools for tuning experiments like &quot;high<br/>third&quot;: if you have access to a Mac, don&apos;t forget the Just Intonation<br/>Calculator (4.5b) internal sound routines have 0.007 Hz precision, which<br/>is about 0.03 cents at A440:</p><p>    ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/mac/jicalc45b1.sea.hqx</p><p>--Ken</p></div>
