The ratios of the primary triad are 6:7:9. I call these<br/>notes G, A++ and D+, which are my names for the 6th, 7th, and 9th<br/>overtones of C. Other notes in the six note otonality I call C, E and<br/>F++, for the 8th, 10th, and 11th overtones.</p><p>This 6:7:9 triad has a minor feel to it. The minor third (7th overtone)<br/>is very flat compared to the minor key derived from the utonality (the<br/>triad based on 4:3 8:5 1:1). It gives the triad a sharp edge to it. To<br/>derive additional triads from the six note scale, I walk up the scale<br/>through five other triads: 7:8:10; 8:9:11; 9:10:12; 10:11:14; 11:12:16.<br/>Triads that include the 11 ratio are especially challenging. These six<br/>chords make up the harmonic material of the piece. There is no<br/>modulation to other parts of the tonality diamond.</p><p>The piece was made using a sampling orchestra written using Csound, with<br/>samples taken from the McGill University Master Samples CD-ROM.<br/>Instruments include the vibraphone, guitar, marimba, bassoon, flute,<br/>cello, violin, percussion, contra bassoon and archlute. The feel of the<br/>song is kind of like a medieval dance song, hence the title: Basse<br/>Danze, a 15th century Italian dance form. It literally means low dance,<br/>where the dancers stay low to the ground and do not leap into the air.<br/>It is typically in 6/4 meter. Source code for the piece is at my<br/>personal web page: <a href="http://pws.prserv.net/music1">http://pws.prserv.net/music1</a> .</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p></div><h3><a id=9391 href="#9391">ðŸ”—</a>William S.

The minor third (7th overtone)<br/> &gt;is very flat compared to the minor key derived from the utonality (the<br/> &gt;triad based on 4:3 8:5 1:1). It gives the triad a sharp edge to it.</p><p>        Really?  I find 6:7:9 very attractive and restful.  I&apos;m still<br/>fairly new to JI and I&apos;ve chosen this particular chord to base most of<br/>my initial exploration around.  In fact, one could say I&apos;ve become<br/>obsessed with the possibilities of a particular ratio: 7/6.</p><p> &gt;                                                                   To<br/> &gt;derive additional triads from the six note scale, I walk up the scale<br/> &gt;through five other triads: 7:8:10; 8:9:11; 9:10:12; 10:11:14; 11:12:16.</p><p>        My first attempt was to just take a tetrachord built up from<br/>combining two 6:7:9&apos;s based on 1/1 and 3/2.  Eventually this got a bit<br/>tedious and I was having trouble keeping up with extra-scalar notes<br/>creeping in to allow certain things, so I started playing with a<br/>duodene-like thing using 7/6 as the vertical axis (excuse the slightly<br/>noisy syntax, which is from the Python library I wrote to mess with JI<br/>ratios):</p><p>*** Duodene(vrat=Ratio(7, 6))<br/>    &lt;14:9&gt;     &lt;7:6&gt;     &lt;7:4&gt;   &lt;21:16&gt;<br/>     &lt;4:3&gt;     &lt;1:1&gt;     &lt;3:2&gt;     &lt;9:8&gt;<br/>     &lt;8:7&gt;    &lt;12:7&gt;     &lt;9:7&gt;   &lt;27:14&gt;</p><p>It turns out there are a number of charming and apparently nameless<br/>chords lurking in that simple collection.  There are of course the<br/>septimal minor triads, and the septimal majors which I don&apos;t care for<br/>in root, closed voicing; I&apos;ve found 6:7:8:9 (4/3, 1/1, 7/6, 3/2) to<br/>have a very rich sound that I like quite a lot.  The 1:3:7 (1/1, 3/2,<br/>7/4) combination is very bright.  The 18:21:24:28 (makes a square in<br/>the chart above, say 7/4, 21/16, 3/2, 9/8) acts as a fine dominant if<br/>you need such a thing.  I&apos;ve also found 12:14:21 (1/1, 7/6, 7/4) is<br/>very useful if prepared.  You can even get a useful I-IV-V-I out of<br/>it, though I find the progression V-IV-I more effective if you keep<br/>the relative voicing such that the top voices go 7/4 - 14/9 - 3/2<br/>(intervals: 8/9 * 27/28).  I find the small upper leading tone very<br/>effective, probably because I listen to so much Arabic classical<br/>music.</p><p>        Do other composers take this approach to exploring the<br/>possibilities of some system of ratios?  I now understand how a book<br/>like &quot;Divisions of the Tetrachord&quot; can get written.  There is subtle<br/>seduction lurking for anyone who isn&apos;t completely put off by the math,<br/>to test, to shuffle, make some noises, and do it all again with some<br/>small variation.</p><p> &gt;Triads that include the 11 ratio are especially challenging. These six<br/> &gt;chords make up the harmonic material of the piece.</p><p>        I liked it.  Thanks for sharing it.  At this point, anything I<br/>hear using JI is a help to me.</p><p>--<br/>William S.
