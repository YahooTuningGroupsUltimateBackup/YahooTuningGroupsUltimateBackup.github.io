He performed them on a guitar whose fretboard had six<br/>&gt;          grooves running the length of it, one under each string, with 24<br/>&gt;(at least,<br/>&gt;          possibly more) slideable frets in each groove, each fret long<br/>&gt;enough for<br/>&gt;          just one string. This guitar is capable of retuning to any<br/>&gt;possible scale<br/>&gt;          within the space limitations of the frets and fingers.</p><p>Anyone have pointers to more info about Hoogewerf ?</p><p>2)<br/>Johnny also posted this way back when :<br/>&gt;Then Virgil Moorefield scared everyone by playing ELECTRIC right up in the<br/>&gt;first row.  During dress rehearsal, I did feel there was one spot that<br/>&gt;might be a bit TOO loud to and mentioned it to<br/>&gt;electric guitarist Evans Wohlforth<br/>Any pointers/info for Wohlforth ?</p><p>3)<br/>Has anyone here tried the Lyrrus GVOX Guitar system ? It&apos;s pretty cheap,<br/>so it would be nice if it worked well enough to use in a studio/home<br/>for experimentation.</p><p>4)<br/>&quot;McDougall, Darren Scott - MCDDS001&quot; posted this :</p><p>&gt;Date: Thu, 3 Sep 1998 17:47:36 +0930<br/>&gt;My reasoning for choosing the MIDI note numbers I did, stemmed from having<br/>&gt;had<br/>&gt;built a 19-tone electric guitar</p><p>Darren, I&apos;d e-mail you privately if I knew what the &apos;eck MCDDS001 was.<br/>Could you get back to me with info about the guitar(s) you use,<br/>your work with it, URL for a home page (if you have it ), etc.</p></div>
