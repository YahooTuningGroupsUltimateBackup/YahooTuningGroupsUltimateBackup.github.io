The example appears in Nicola<br/>Vicentino, _Ancient Music Adapted to Modern Practice_, tr. Maria Rika<br/>Maniates, ed. Claude V. Palisca (New Haven: Yale University Press,<br/>1996), ISBN 0-300-06601-5.</p><p>This example, from his treatise of 1555 which Maniates and Rika have<br/>translated into English, is here shown using a notation where C4 is<br/>middle C, higher note numbers show higher octaves, and the symbol &quot;r&quot;<br/>shows a rest. The ASCII asterisk (*) indicates a note raised by a<br/>diesis, roughly 1/5-tone, or about half of a meantone chromatic<br/>semitone. Brackets indicate accidentals not indicated in Vicentino&apos;s<br/>original edition. Note the crossing of the lower two parts:</p><p>1    &amp;    2     &amp;   |  1    &amp;    2     ||<br/>C4      C[*]4         C4<br/>Ab3      G*4          Ab3  Ab*3  A3<br/>F3       C*3          F3<br/>r   F3         E*3    F3</p><p>In this example, the next-to-highest voice moves in the second measure<br/>from the minor third above the bass through Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate<br/>minor third&quot; to a concluding major third.</p><p>Vicentino describes the proximate minor third, at ~11:9, as relatively<br/>concordant, in contrast to the &quot;proximate major third&quot; a diesis larger<br/>than the usual major third, for which he gives an approximate ratio of<br/>&quot;4-1/2:3-1/2&quot; or 9:7; he finds this latter interval to tend toward<br/>dissonance.</p><p>More specifically, the proximate minor third on Vicentino&apos;s _archicembalo_<br/>or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; is defined as an interval of a usual minor third<br/>plus a diesis or fifthtone (e.g. C-Eb*). The size of this interval may<br/>vary slightly depending on exactly how one interprets Vicentino&apos;s<br/>temperament, with a circulating 31-note version of 1/4-comma meantone a<br/>likely choice, but 31-tone equal temperament (31-tet) an interpretation<br/>favored in the 17th century by Lemme Rossi in his treatise of 1666.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone, depending on the order of tuning, Vicentino&apos;s<br/>proximate minor third may be equal to either a regular minor third<br/>(~310.26 cents) plus a 128:125 diesis (~41.06 cents), ~351.32 cents;<br/>or the pure 5:4 major third of this tuning (~386.31 cents) minus the<br/>same diesis, ~345.25 cents. Either tuning is a close approximation of<br/>11:9, ~347.41 cents. Note that the difference between these two<br/>&quot;flavors&quot; of near-11:9 thirds, ~6.07 cents, is equal to the 31-note<br/>meantone &quot;comma&quot; by which 31 meantone fifths fall short of 18 pure<br/>octaves.</p><p>In 31-tet, which would exactly fit Vicentino&apos;s theoretical model of a<br/>whole-tone divided into five &quot;minor dieses,&quot; the proximate minor third<br/>would have a precisely uniform size of 9/31-octave or 9/5-tone -- a<br/>regular minor third of 8/5-tone (~309.67 cents) plus a diesis of<br/>1/5-tone or 1/31-octave (~38.71 cents) -- or ~348.38 cents, within one<br/>cent of 11:9.</p><p>Both Vicentino&apos;s direction that the first 12 notes of his instrument<br/>(Eb-G#) should be tuned as on usual keyboards, and the limitations of<br/>known 16th-century tuning methods, suggest 1/4-comma meantone as a more<br/>likely realization than a precise 31-tet. Very possibly the slight<br/>inaccuracies of an actual tuning around 1555 might be greater than the<br/>small discrepancy between these two mathematical models.</p><p>In the cadence quoted above, the next-to-highest voice or alto<br/>concludes by progressing through two &quot;fifthtones&quot; or minor dieses, in<br/>emulation of the ancient Greek enharmonic genus: Ab-Ab*-A. This is a<br/>kind of ornament which might be improvised to decorate various cadences.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
