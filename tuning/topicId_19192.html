One can get familiar with the various intervals --<br/>there&apos;s a symmetry like that on the standard keyboard arrangement, it&apos;s just<br/>a slightly different one.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 19-tone mapping to a 12, I find very confusing. Try to play a<br/>multi-octave major scale . . . ugh!</p></div>
