So am I missing something?</p><p>yes.  you&apos;re missing the difference between the arithmetic<br/>of musical ratios, and the human perception of pitch --<br/>which is logarithmic.</p><p>it has to do with what we perceive as &quot;octave equivalence&quot;,<br/>which is the &quot;affect&quot; of prime-factor 2, since the most<br/>basic rational interpretation of the &quot;octave&quot; is the ratio<br/>2:1.</p><p>because doubling or halving a frequency results in the<br/>perception of &quot;octave equivalence&quot; -- i.e., all pitches<br/>which are related by a 2:1 ratio are considered in some<br/>sense to be &quot;the same&quot; -- the actual *frequency* measurement<br/>of octaves keeps changing, always becoming double the<br/>one below or half the one above.</p><p>for example, the octave below A-440 Hz is A-220 Hz,<br/>which is 220 Hz less.  but the octave above A-440 is<br/>A-880 Hz, which is 440 Hz more.</p><p>because of this, the &quot;arithmetic mean&quot; between two<br/>frequencies or two ratios is never the *logarithmic* mean.</p><p>thus, while 2:3:4 makes a nice arithmetic proportion<br/>which has a &quot;root&quot; at the bottom, a 3:2 &quot;perfect-5th&quot;<br/>in the middle, and 2:1 (i.e., 4:2) &quot;octave&quot; at the top,<br/>the 3 will be slightly higher than the logarithmic mean.</p><p>as you observed, the logarithmic mean of the octave is<br/>the equal-tempered &quot;tritone&quot; of 600 cents.  the arithmetic<br/>mean is the 3:2 &quot;perfect-5th&quot; of about 702 cents.</p><p>your explanation of &quot;why the 7 chord sounds good&quot; mirrors<br/>Harry Partch&apos;s concept of the &quot;numerary nexus&quot;.  those<br/>four ratios form a nice proportion of 4:5:6:7, which<br/>is the most consonant chord that can be produced with<br/>four different pitches which do not exhibit any octave<br/>equivalence.</p><p>i hope that helps.</p><p>if you&apos;re a newbie to tuning theory, you might want<br/>to take a look at my Encyclopaedia of Tuning.<br/>try these for starters, and follow the links from there:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/affect.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/affect.htm</a><br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/prime.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/prime.htm</a><br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/octave.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/octave.htm</a><br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/nexus.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/nexus.htm</a></p><p>-monz</p></div>
