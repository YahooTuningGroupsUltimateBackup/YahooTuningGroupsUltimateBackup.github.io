Yes, we have a &quot;formula&quot; --<br/>called &quot;octave-equivalent harmonic entropy&quot;. The resulting family of<br/>curves reflect the same relative consonance ratings for the Ratios of<br/>3, of 5, of 7, of 9, and of 11, that Partch shows in the graph. But<br/>the behavior of the curve at other points better reflects Partch&apos;s<br/>own philosophy -- namely, all the ratios in the 11-limit should be at<br/>local minima of dissonance -- and the One-Footed Bride as Partch drew<br/>it would imply otherwise, if taken too &quot;literally&quot; (an odd term to<br/>apply to a curve, but you know what I mean).</p><p>&gt; I have the Sethares formulas for consonance,</p><p>I&apos;ve tried working with Sethares on using these formulas but we ended<br/>up with some unresolved conundrums (I&apos;m still hoping to hear from<br/>Sethares since he told me he would try to look into it further).</p><p>Looking forward to continuing discussions on harmonic_entropy,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=23921 href="#23921">ðŸ”—</a>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@aracnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2001 9:42:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Ed Borasky&quot; &lt;znmeb@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On a lighter note, does anyone have the &quot;formula&quot; for<br/>Partch&apos;s &quot;One-<br/>&gt; &gt; Footed Bride&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Ed, we&apos;ve discussed this quite a bit over on the harmonic<br/>entropy<br/>&gt; list (harmonic_entropy@y...).
