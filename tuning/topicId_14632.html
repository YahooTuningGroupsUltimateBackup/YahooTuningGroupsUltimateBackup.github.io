From here we<br/>can determine the rest of the tuning, with a fifth of ~704.136 cents.</p><p>Does this look at all familiar? Curiously, Keenan Pepper&apos;s &quot;Noble<br/>Fifth&quot; tuning based on the Phi-based mediant between 4/7-octave and<br/>3/5-octave (weighted toward the latter) yields a fifth of ~704.096<br/>cents.</p><p>In discussing the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; temperament, devised as Keenan Pepper<br/>has emphasized from the viewpoint of a theoretical &quot;noble generator&quot;<br/>rather than specifically as a neo-Gothic temperament, I noted the very<br/>close approximation of Phi for the augmented fifth.</p><p>Thus these two tunings, derived from Phi in radically different ways,<br/>curiously are almost identical.</p><p>Again, I&apos;d like to emphasize that these distinct methods of using Phi<br/>should _not_ be confused or equated; here, for whatever reason, they<br/>happen to produce these similar results.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
