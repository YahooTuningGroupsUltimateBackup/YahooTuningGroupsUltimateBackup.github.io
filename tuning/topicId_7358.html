In the process, I dug up a SPEBSQSA<br/>handbook, and found a story that I thought some here might find interesting...</p><p>&quot;_Was barbershop harmony actually sung in barbershops?_</p><p>Certainly -- and on street corners (it was sometimes called &quot;curbstone&quot;<br/>harmony) and at social functions and in parlors.  Its roots are not just<br/>the white, Middle-America of Norman Rockwell&apos;s famous painting.  Rather,<br/>barbershop is a &quot;melting pot&quot; product of African-American musical devices,<br/>European hymn-singing culture, and an American tradition of recreational<br/>music.</p><p>Immigrants to the new world brought with them a musical repertoire that<br/>included hymns, psalms, and folk songs.  These simple songs were often sung<br/>in four parts with the meldoy set in the second-lowest voice.  Minstrel<br/>shows of the mid-1800&apos;s often consisted of white singers in blackface (and<br/>later black singers themselves) performing songs and sketches based on a<br/>romanticized vision of plantation life.  As the minstrel show was<br/>supplanted by the equally popular vaudeville, the tradition of<br/>close-harmony quartets remained, often as a &quot;four act&quot; combining music with<br/>ethnic comedy that would be scandalous by modern standards.</p><p>The &quot;barbershop&quot; style of music is first associated with black southern<br/>quartets of the 1870&apos;s, such as &quot;The American Four&quot; and &quot;The Hamtown<br/>Students&quot;.  The African influence is particularly notable in the<br/>improvisational nature of the harmonization, and the flexing of melody to<br/>produce harmonies in &quot;swipes&quot; and &quot;snakes&quot;.  Black quartets &quot;cracking a<br/>chord&quot; were commonplace at places like Joe Sarpy&apos;s Cut Rate Shaving Parlor<br/>in St. Louis, or in Jacksonville, Florida, where, black historian James<br/>Weldon Johnson writes, &quot;every barbershop seemed to have its own quartet&quot;.</p><p>The first written use of the word &quot;barbershop&quot; when referring to<br/>harmonizing came in 1910, with the publication of the song, &quot;Play That<br/>Barbershop Chord&quot; -- evidence that the term was in common parlance by that<br/>time.</p><p>_O.C. Cash &amp; Rupert Hall_</p><p>While travelling to Kansas City on business, Tulsa tax attorney O.C. Cash<br/>happened to meet fellow Tulsan Rupert Hall in the lobby of the Muehlebach<br/>Hotel.  The men fell to talking and discovered they shared a mutual love of<br/>vocal harmony.  Together they bemoaned the decline of that all-American<br/>institution, the barbershop quartet, and decided to stem that decline.</p><p>Signing their names as &quot;Rupert Hall, Royal Keeper of the Minor Keys, and<br/>O.C. Cash, Third Temporary Assistant Vice Chairman,&quot; of the &quot;Society for<br/>the Preservation and Propagation of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in the<br/>United States [sic], the two invited their friends to a songfest on the<br/>roof garden of the Tulsa Club, on April 11, 1938.</p><p>Twenty-six men attended that first meeting, and returned the following week<br/>with more friends.  About 150 men attended the third meeting, and the grand<br/>sounds from harmony they raised on the rooftop created quite a stir.  A<br/>traffic jam formed outside the hotel.  While police tried to straighten out<br/>the problem, a reporter of the local newspaper heard the singing, sensed a<br/>great story, and joined the meeting.</p><p>O.C. Cash bluffed his way through the interview, saying his organization<br/>was national in scope, with branches in St. Louis, Kansas City, and<br/>elsewhere.  He neglected to mention that these &quot;branches&quot; were just a few<br/>scattered friends who enjoyed harmonizing, but knew nothing of Cash&apos;s new<br/>club.</p><p>Cash&apos;s flair for publicity, combined with the unusual name (the ridiculous<br/>initials poked fun at the alphabet soup of New Deal programs), made an<br/>irresistable story for the news wire services, which spread it coast to<br/>coast.  Cash&apos;s &quot;branches&quot; started receiving puzzling calls from men<br/>interested in joining the barbershop society.  Soon, groups were meeting<br/>throughout North America to sing barbershop harmony.</p><p>_The Early Years_</p><p>Operating out of living rooms and garages, the Society was an informal<br/>affair in its first years.  Memberships could be had by writing to Cash and<br/>Hall and requesting a certificate, which the founders financed out of their<br/>own pockets.  The first formal convention, held in Tulsa in June of 1939,<br/>brought together 150 men from 17 cities for a weekend of harmonizing and a<br/>contest to crown the &quot;World Champion Quartet&quot; -- a distinction won by the<br/>Bartlesville Barflies of Oklahoma.</p><p>The Society grew rapidly in the post-war years, in 1945 doubling in size<br/>from 4,000 to 8,200 members in 200 chapters.  By 1957, the Society had<br/>grown to 26,000 members in 625 chapters, and an aggressive &quot;Expansion<br/>Program&quot; was initiated to provide educational services and purchase a<br/>permanent home for the Society&apos;s administrative staff.  A mansion in<br/>Kenosha, Wisconsin, became the new base of operations.  SPEBSQSA had come<br/>of age.&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&quot;In this age of dictators and government control of everything, about the<br/>only privilege guaranteed by the Bill of Rights not in some way supervised<br/>or directed is the art of barbershop quartet singing.  Without a doubt, we<br/>still have the right of peaceable assembly which, we are advised by<br/>competent legal authority, includes quartet singing.</p><p>The writers have, for a long time, thought that something should be done to<br/>encourage the enjoyment of this last remaining vestige of human liberty.&quot;</p><p>-- O.C. Cash and Rupert Hall</p></div>
