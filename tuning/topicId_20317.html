Yes, we associate<br/>sitar, tabla, etc, with Indian music...but, this sort of thinking, to<br/>me, may get in the way of one&apos;s creativity if we&apos;re not careful. In<br/>fact, it wasn&apos;t long ago that guitar itself was not accepted in Indian<br/>forms by some of the traditional maestros; now, I know there are several<br/>great guitarists in that tradition. Instruments are just tools of<br/>communication...it&apos;s the end result that matters. Of course, I&apos;m sure<br/>this is not news to you...just wanted to mention it...thanks...Hstick</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2001 7:18:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;    Hey Jacky...you know, I wouldn&apos;t worry much about using<br/>instruments<br/>&gt; from any culture in any positive way...<br/>..............</p><p>In a positive response to Neil&apos;s message, I may recapitulate the<br/>requirements for playing raga music (these requirements do not apply<br/>if your are NOT playing a raga, but just enjoying the beauty of a<br/>note, or a scale, or the timbre of any instrument):</p><p>For an instrument to qualify to play Indian classical music,<br/>(i)  it should be capable of playing meend (glissando)<br/>(ii) it should be capable of playing gamaka<br/>(iii)it should be capable of producing 5-limit JI<br/>     This implies that it should be fretless.  Or it may have frets<br/>but must easily take care of shruti-s.</p><p>But note that vina was replaced by Sitar; pakhavaj by tabla; sarangi<br/>by Harmonium (for accompaniement).  Also, Santoor was a folk<br/>instrument adopted to the classical music style, and has to simulate<br/>meend and gamaka.  Violin and guitar have become instruments of<br/>choice. So, the Indian classical music has undergone many changes,<br/>but the requirements enumerated above, remain the same.</p><p>For a musician to qualify to play Indian music:<br/>(i)  He must be proficient in meend, gamaka and shruti-s.<br/>(ii) He must have thorough knowledge of the raga-s.</p><p>But here again, there are levels of proficiency and learning.<br/>Ideally, only after reaching the highest level should a musician<br/>think of performing, especially on the stage.</p><p>These are the guidelines for any instrument, Indian or not, and any<br/>musician, Indian or not.</p><p>Haresh.</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2001 12:19:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Haresh wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;But here again, there are levels of proficiency and learning.<br/>Ideally, only after reaching the highest level should a musician think<br/>of performing, especially on the stage.
