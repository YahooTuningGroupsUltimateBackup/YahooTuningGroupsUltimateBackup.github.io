The basic tetrachord would be:</p><p>   1/1   13/12   81/64   4/3<br/>    0     139     408    498</p><p>Here the middle interval is actually 243/208, or around 269<br/>cents, or greater than 7/6 by 729/728, the same amount by which<br/>243/224 is greater than 13/12. From a musical perspective, we<br/>have something just about identical to what you described trying<br/>with your sons!</p><p>According to Hormoz Farhat, a modern Iranian Chahargah would be<br/>tuned like this on the tar tuning he recommends, based on the<br/>average values for some instruments:</p><p>   0    135     410    500<br/>   G    Ap       B      C</p><p>Obviously we have a very similar concept, although the middle<br/>step is slightly wider than 7/6 at around 275 cents.</p><p>Around 1300, Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi suggests a tuning for Hijaz,<br/>very much the same type of tetrachord, at 1/1-12/11-14/11-4/3 or<br/>12:11-7:6-22:21 (150-267-81 cents). Thus we would have, in<br/>Persian notation:</p><p>    0     151    418  498<br/>    G     Ap      B    C</p><p>Interestingly, in a tempered system like O3, there are rough<br/>analogues of both your &quot;soldierly/desertly&quot; form and the close<br/>equivalents in the Ibn Sina and Farhat tunings, with a middle<br/>second at around 13/12; and the Qutb al-Din tuning, with a middle<br/>second of around 12/11 (or the &quot;150 cents&quot; or so you mentioned).</p><p>Given the Pythagorean framework for the regular major and minor<br/>intervals which you and also Scott Marcus, for example, have<br/>noted in much maqam music, O3 might be described as a subtle and<br/>(hopefully) artful distortion of this basic framework.</p><p>By extending each regular fifth by one or two binary millioctaves<br/>(1.17 or 2.34 cents), the most notable alteration is that<br/>augmented and diminished intervals shift from near-5-based to<br/>near-13-based (e.g. apotome ~14/13; diminished third ~11/10;<br/>augmented second ~40/33; diminished fourth ~26/21).</p><p>Another, more subtle, effect is to stretch the ditone from 81/64<br/>to somewhere between 33/26 and 14/11, the latter used by Qutb<br/>al-Din.</p><p>Let us first consider the nearest approximation of your<br/>&quot;soldierly and desertly&quot; Hijaz or Chahargah. With this tempered<br/>system, as with superparticular JI, a simple chain of 12 fifths<br/>will not supply intervals such as 13/12 or 12/11. In O3, two<br/>12-note chains are spaced so that a regular major sixth plus the<br/>distance between the chains produces a pure 7/4 (or actually one<br/>of the best two 1024-EDO approximations thereof), a procedure<br/>which also produces versions of 13/12 and 12/11 always within a<br/>cent of just.</p><p>Thus for your &quot;soldierly/desertly&quot; version with 13/12, or<br/>Farhat&apos;s Chahargah also available in a rational version on Ibn<br/>Sina&apos;s &grave;oud tuning, we have:</p><p>    Persian notation:   G    Ap      B    C<br/>    O3 keyboard:        E    F*      G#   A<br/>                        0   138     416  497</p><p>This tetrachord of 0-138-416-497 cents or 138-278-81 cents has a<br/>central interval close to Farhat&apos;s 275 cents, although a tad<br/>larger, and a notably narrower limma than Pythagorean at 81 cents,<br/>almost identtcal to Qutb al-Din&apos;s just 22:21 step.</p><p>For Qutb al-Din&apos;s tuning with its 12/11 step, we must shift to a<br/>note in O3 which is part of the upper chain of fifths:</p><p>    Persian notation:   G     Ap     B    C<br/>    O3 keyboard:        G*    A      B*   C*<br/>                        0    151    416  497</p><p>This time we have 151-265-81 cents, very close to Qutb al-Din&apos;s<br/>12:11-7:6-22:21 (151-267-81 cents).</p><p>As Ozan might have me observe, Turkish theory and practice often<br/>favor a middle step around 7:6 or 12 commas of 53 (either in<br/>Pythagorean or 53-EDO, an interval slightly larger than 7:6,<br/>around 271 or 272 cents). However, in Turkish practice, the major<br/>third step of Hijaz is often smaller than 81/64 or 14/11. Amine<br/>Beyhom, a Lebanese composer and theorist, measured one<br/>interpretation at around 0-130-395-485 cents (130-265-90 cents).<br/>While the near-7:6 is in keeping with the soldierly/desertly or<br/>Farhat version also available in Ibn Sina&apos;s &grave;oud tuning, as well<br/>as Qutb al-Din&apos;s tuning, the narrower major third is not too far<br/>from 5/4 -- with the upper step at 90 cents, a usual Pythagorean<br/>limma, here leading to a narrow fourth at around 485 cents.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m one of those people who takes medieval<br/>superparticular ratios for maqam music quite seriously, and seeks<br/>to realize reasonably accurate approximations on a modern<br/>keyboard.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t mean that performances approximating 24-EDO aren&apos;t<br/>also possible; and I have seen at least one Iranian theorist<br/>propose 43-EDO. However, where a superparticular model fits well,<br/>I see no reason not to celebrate this millennium-long tradition<br/>which is, as you say, ultimately a matter of musical feeling<br/>rather than abstract mathematics alone.</p><p>A final note: Hijaz, often (although not always) tending toward<br/>to a middle step close to 7:6, does indeed carry the association<br/>of the Hijaz region of desert for maqam musicians, so that your<br/>&quot;desertly&quot; description of this step seems to fit the Near Eastern<br/>tradition. While I&apos;m not sure if a 3:2 carries a &quot;soldierly&quot; or<br/>martial connotation in the world of maqam, I recall that it does<br/>have this association in William Byrd, for example, around 1600,<br/>who uses lots of fifths in his suite for harpsichord about a<br/>battle. Maybe I might say, speaking only for myself, that it<br/>might more generally carry the character which is in Arabic<br/>called _sumud_ or &quot;steadfastness,&quot; a virtue in many situations.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=93794 href="#93794">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2010 2:30:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo, thanks for yet another detailed and fascinating post!</p><p>The terms &quot;soldierly&quot; and &quot;desert-ly&quot; (&quot;voja&sup1;ko&quot; and &quot;pu&sup1;&egrave;avkso&quot; respectively) are my 6-year old son&apos;s descriptions, of his own device.<br/>Of course these are associative- he recognizes them as characteristic intervals from films, cartoons and documentaries, as my wife immediately recognizes 5-limit (and higher) JI as &quot;church music&quot;.
