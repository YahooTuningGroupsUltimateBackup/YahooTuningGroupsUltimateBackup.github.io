What<br/>&gt; happened to your &quot;high third&quot;?</p><p>Paul, I&apos;m not married to the &quot;high third.&quot; I&apos;m just curious about it.</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, if steps can really be heard as<br/>&gt; ratios in this way,</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure I can. But perhaps I&apos;m thinking 2-3 context instead of<br/>&quot;phantom fundamental.&quot; That&apos;s why I propose a blind experiment to test my<br/>thesis and objectify the matter.</p><p>&gt; wouldn&apos;t it be kind of natural to interpret the &quot;high<br/>&gt; third&quot; as the product of two 8:9 steps, i.e., a Pythagorean major third?</p><p>Intellectually, perhaps. Likely not &quot;naturally&quot; (perceptually). I&apos;m more<br/>concerned about what causes, or contributes to, the &quot;high third&quot; experience<br/>as I have described it here many times--which I suspect has little or<br/>nothing to do with major seconds, neither intellectually nor naturally.</p><p>&gt; That is the usual take on Indian music, where the just (5/4) and Pythagorean<br/>&gt; (81/64) major thirds are sruti #s 7 and 8 out of a 22-sruti octave. Now it<br/>&gt; is true that the Pythagorean major third wouldn&apos;t lock harmonically as part<br/>&gt; of a triad, so for the third time I suggest the possibility of<br/>&gt; 1/24:1/19:1/16 for your locked major triad with high third.</p><p>For now the second time in a post to you (and the third if you count another<br/>to someone else) I am requesting a clarification of what appear to be<br/>fractions separated by colons. Please unlock the code. For example, how does<br/>the expression 4/5 relate to the expression 4:5? Also, what does 1/x<br/>represent? I really would like to know what you are saying here. Can someone<br/>whose math training ended at college algebra have a fighting chance of<br/>understanding? I hope this is simply a matter of form rather than of depth.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
