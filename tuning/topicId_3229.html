For the past fifteen minutes I&apos;ve been explaining to her what<br/>microtonal music is. It&apos;s all new to her and I&apos;m excited in that I know<br/>that her first introduction to it is about to be a revelation. We are not<br/>disappointed. Appel a deux( 1998), an American premiere of a work by Anton<br/>Rovner provides a stunning opener in this masterfully composed, complex yet<br/>moving work. Greg Evans (perhaps the finest French horn player that I&apos;ve<br/>ever heard) was right there with the incomparable Anastasia Solberg on<br/>viola.</p><p>&#x9;The core group of the American Festival of Microtonal Music (AFMM) &#xFFFD;<br/>Andrew Bolotowsky, Michiyo Suzuki, Anastasia Solberg and Johnny Reinhard<br/>assembled to treat us to four short and diverse settings. I&apos;m reminded of<br/>the Columbia Group for New Music days when Wuorinen and Sollberger would<br/>include an adaptation of Medieval music on each program for the purpose of<br/>reminding us that alternative approaches to rhythm, interval and formal<br/>organization have always existed. Here then in St. Paul&apos;s reverberating<br/>acoustics we get to hear Hymnus and Organum (c.1000) in Pythagorean tuning,<br/>another anonymous work composed around 1500 that freely inserts tones<br/>smaller than the half-step and two early moderns (Percy Granger and Ivan<br/>Wyschnegradsky who in 1939 push the concept of micro-embellishing to even<br/>denser degrees of super-chromaticism. Brevity left us wishing to hear more.<br/>These were like gourmet appetizers in short supply. My friend the pianist,<br/>while applauding turns to me and explains how beautiful and expressive<br/>everything is. I meanwhile am enlightening her to the notion that the<br/>31-tone et organ in Haarlem, Netherlands is not a 31 note squeeze box but<br/>rather an instrument that has 31 tones within a single octave. &quot;Oh my&quot; she<br/>replies and I know she in her imagination is already trying to figure out<br/>how to play it.</p><p>&#x9;The next two works, Potion Scene (1931) by Harry Partch and La Rivera de<br/>las Nueve Corriente, V-VIII (1998) by German Romero each featured the<br/>soprano voice. Meredith Borden sang the Partch and Mary Hurlburt the Romero<br/>which was a World Premiere. Both works came across with compelling drama. I<br/>of course had to rush up to the music stands during the intermission<br/>between them to check the Partch score and ask a few questions of the<br/>artists. I am so impressed by the depth of their study. Anastasia Solberg<br/>realized her conventionally notated part herself by constructing it from<br/>Partch&apos;s numerical ratio notation adding numerous indications in cents to<br/>specify the precise tuning. She told me that some day she hopes to be able<br/>to read at sight Partch&apos;s notation. There is no question that Solberg and<br/>Borden hear every nuance of what amounts to over 40 divisions per octave.<br/>My own encounters as a pianist with realizing figured bass from the numbers<br/>without writing out a part for myself seem like baby-steps  by comparison<br/>to their efforts. But the reward is great. These pioneering vocalists are<br/>leading us toward a new approach to the voice. Gone are the tonal clich&#xFFFD;s<br/>but also gone are the awkward and angular leaps of much 20th Century vocal<br/>writing that breaks away from Classical or Romantic roots. Here in the<br/>microtonal domain it&apos;s the world of intervallic subtlety into which we are<br/>transported.</p><p>&#x9;The penultimate work on the program  by Joseph Pehrson, One Small Step for<br/>Man (1999) is a World Premiere written for the grandmaster himself of<br/>microtonality Johnny Reinhard playing solo bassoon. It&apos;s  in 48 tone equal<br/>temperament work (eighthtones). The work was appealing on first hearing and<br/>obviously well-composed and one that I am eager to hear again several more<br/>times. The final work by Skip LaPlante, Camping in the Backyard (1999),  is<br/>also a World Premiere. Bolotowsky played conical Boehm flute, Reinhard<br/>played bassoon and Mathew Fieldes string bass with the composer on an<br/>invented instrument made of tuned aluminum tubes. Each of its five concise<br/>movements came across with taste, sophistication and focus. Without the aid<br/>of program notes there is no way that I could know that he utilizes 17-tone<br/>et but it&apos;s this enticing fact offered by the composer that adds that extra<br/>dimension of adventure to the listening experience.</p><p>&#x9;As I left St. Paul&apos;s Chapel I felt the atmosphere permeated by an evening<br/>of music that comes across as deeply soulful most of the time and yet this<br/>whole genre at this point in its development carries with a strong spirit<br/>of adventure, challenge and fun. I eagerly await the next offering of AFMM<br/>wherever and whenever that may take place.<br/>&#x9;<br/>Howard Rovics<br/><a href="http://w3.nai.net/~rovics">http://w3.nai.net/~rovics</a></p></div>
