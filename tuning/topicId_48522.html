This is one of the reasons I<br/>came to dislike yahoo.  The problem was many months ago now, so I have<br/>forgotten the details somewhat.</p><p>But it had to do with the fact that what yahoo appeared to be asking me to<br/>do was not what I actually needed to do.  It was possibly because there was<br/>more than one email account involved:  I already had an email account<br/>associated with my yahoo account and it was not the one I had used when<br/>subscribing to the tuning list.  I kept doing the wrong thing over and over.<br/>And at least the first couple of times I&apos;m pretty sure it looked different,<br/>like I wasn&apos;t exactly repeating my steps.  Eventually I was obviously<br/>repeating my steps.  At that point maybe I called Carl and he told me what<br/>to do, or else I figured out that I had another choice in some way offered<br/>on the web page.  I had to do something much simpler that did not involve<br/>filling in a text field again, but instead clicking some other button, if I<br/>recall correctly.</p><p>Sorry that&apos;s all I remember.</p><p>Maybe if someone runs into a similar problem again we can figure it out once<br/>and for all.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
