Compared<br/>to Julia Werntz&apos;s position, this is an almost entirely JI-oriented<br/>list! Even those on this list who are into ETs (and what about those<br/>of us in between who are into linear and planar temperaments including<br/>microtemperaments) do so in order to approximate JI intervals. Only<br/>Dan Stearns comes to mind as extolling the virtues of certain ETs as<br/>interesting regardless of JI or approximations, and he is certainly<br/>not hostile to JI.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the occasional hostilities (_very_ occasional compared<br/>to other lists) have ever been a JI vs. ET thing, more usually a maths<br/>and science versus numerology and magic thing. We spawned new lists<br/>for both of these, but this list still exists so I guess it is<br/>supposed to foster dialog between these camps. My guess is that it&apos;s<br/>the nature of the medium. The math/science types are simply more<br/>inclined to _write_.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2002 12:41:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; You dismiss this without having heard it!</p><p> To Argue the JI is not consonant is contrary to my own experience and thousands of others. Even Derreg recognized it was more consonant<br/>and the argument has always been too consonant. If not why would we use it. Because some one told us so? yes every one who hears JI does<br/>so because of some belief in low integer ratios.<br/>    BUT consonance does not mean something is better music otherwise music on a single harmonic series would be the best there was. Just<br/>as the most complex is the not best.<br/>    I find the statements on the other side of the coin just as outrageous, but don&apos;t label them fanatics.<br/>    Also DIVISION is good. Who wants every thing to be one big homogenous whole.<br/> If java and bali got along better we would be poorer in diversity, which homogenousness touches upon by only it little shallow<br/>escapades. NO the greater the division, the more the musics will develop in opposite direction. The great thing about the music on this<br/>globes is that we have a myriad of unreconcilable musical systems.<br/> With all the &quot;infinite possibilities&quot; charted now within western music, it totally amazes me at what does not and possibly never will<br/>happen coming from that tradition, that is already here on the globe. Yes the division might be best served by removing myself which is<br/>once again coming close.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Subject: Re: to Joe Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What patent nonsense. I personally find that Brahm&apos;s lullaby, for<br/>&gt; example, is very soothing in 12-equal. If it is more so in JI, the<br/>&gt; difference is extremely small.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you see what I (and Julia) mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose that some JI proponents feel they need to make such<br/>&gt; outrageous statements against non-JI tunings to try to counteract the<br/>&gt; huge amount of ignorance and inertia working against acceptance of JI.<br/>&gt; But I hope we can all see now that they really don&apos;t help the cause at<br/>&gt; all. They just lead to further reactions in the opposite direction<br/>&gt; like those of Julia&apos;s dissertation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps the time is ripe for a little reconciliation. And a little<br/>&gt; recognition that there is a hell of a lot of middle ground between<br/>&gt; strict JI and 12-equal. We should be building bridges not fortifying<br/>&gt; bunkers. 72-ET is a marvelous bridge.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2002 12:58:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig, I agree that diversity is good, but not division in the sense<br/>of mistrust and feeling the need to exaggerate the flaws in the other<br/>guy&apos;s ideas.

I received my answer on this group. Thanks.</p><p>As a struggling JI enthusiast (still in the JI boot camp)I often ask<br/>myself what drives me to want to stay up late at night reading and<br/>studying tuning theory. I did lousy in math while a young skippy in<br/>school and yet everything with regards to JI theory is starting<br/>to &quot;click&quot;.</p><p>Maybe its a result of when I first heard a pure interval on my<br/>Hammond Organ (sounding a single note and humming and interval until<br/>it sounded perfect). That was the coolest thing I ever heard! I<br/>forget who, but someone on this list told me to try it.</p><p>That&apos;s what makes this group one of the coolest groups in the world!<br/>SUPPORT !!!!</p><p>I too have often thought, what sounds the best 12tET, or JI or 31tET<br/>51, etc. etc. and finally came to the conclusion WHO CARES !! THEY<br/>ALL SOUND GOOD! In the right hands, any of these tuning can sound<br/>awesome! I look at different tunings like a clump of clay, just<br/>waiting to be molded by the right artist.</p><p>I was confused earlier on and at times I still am when I read tuning<br/>professionals trashing 12tET. Its not the perfect tuning but guess<br/>what? Its probably the most widely used successful tuning in the<br/>world. Agree? Does that make it the right tuning?? Of course not!</p><p>I tripped across Kyle Gann&apos;s web page a few years ago and that also<br/>started me on my journey.</p><p>Its the support of all the &quot;expert&quot; members on this page that breed<br/>the study of tuning theory into new ethusiasts like myself.
