Bach is reputed to have<br/>&gt;insisted that all major thirds be tuned sharp.</p><p>Good question! What we really need to know is: did Bach insist that all<br/>major thirds be tuned sharp so that a circulating well-temperament that<br/>sounded nice in all 12 keys would result; or did he really prefer the sound<br/>of sharp major thirds to pure ones. Since (as far as I know) this statement<br/>on Bach&apos;s part was restricted to a discussion of keyboard tuning, I suspect<br/>the former, though we may never know for sure. But in the context of this<br/>thread, namely adaptive JI, where all the major thirds are going to be tuned<br/>pure anyway, you&apos;d end up with smaller melodic shifts if you start in<br/>1/4-comma meantone than 1/6-comma meantone.</p></div>
