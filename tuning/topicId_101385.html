I&apos;d be more than willing to write<br/>&gt; the code for you (is Scala<br/>&gt; open-source?) or to write a pseudocode algorithm or something in C++<br/>&gt; if that&apos;d make it easier.</p><p>Yes, in the sense that anyone may read and compile the source. But not in the GPL sense.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2011 9:06:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;manuphonic&quot; &lt;manuphonic@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Nah, I screwed up the second time when I said I screwed up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then your beautiful diamond9keemictrans.scl really is convex, just as you started off saying.
