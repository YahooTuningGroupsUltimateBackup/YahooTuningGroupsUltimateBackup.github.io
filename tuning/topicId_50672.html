The improvisation of a raga is a process in which every future note to be performed depends not only on the present note being performed, but also on how this present note was arrived at.</p><p>Inferences from the above statements:</p><p>(1) the larger the number of notes in a raga, the greater is its Harmonic Entropy. Obviously, it follows that vivadi (omitted) notes lower the Harmonic Entropy.</p><p>(2) The greater the number of random ways in which we can combine the notes, the greater is the raga&apos;s Harmonic Entropy.</p><p>(3) The greater the distance of the notes from the Sa (tonic), the greater is the raga&apos;s Harmonic Entropy.</p><p>(4) The greater the specificity -- and consquent recognizability -- of a raga, the lower its Harmonic Entropy. This is because, one recognizes a raga from (i) the way and (ii) the order in which its constituent notes are ordered. This reduces randomness. This is where the &quot;jumps&quot; I referred to in a previous email, comes into play. These &quot;jumps&quot; lower the Harmonic Entropy of the raga.</p><p>(5) The longer one stays on a note, the lower the Harmonic Entropy gets. This happens all the time, because the vadi and samvadi notes are stayed on longer -- even some other notes are stayed longer on, too, depending upon the requirements of a raga. Similarly, vivadi (omitted) notes lower the Harmonic Entropy. At the end of every alap (phrase), we come back to Sa (tonic), resulting in minimum entropy.</p><p>(6) The greater the number of times a note is repeated, the lower the Harmonic Entropy gets. As an example, Ga-Ga has a lower Harmonic Entropy than Ga-Pa.</p><p>(7) The greater the use of embellishments [ornaments like gamaka, meend (glissando), murki etc.], the greater the Harmonic Entropy.</p><p>(8) The greater the use of vowels and consonants, the greater the Harmonic Entropy. The vowel normally used is singing is &apos;aa&apos;. Variations are achieved by the use of &apos;ee&apos;, &apos;o&apos;, &apos;e&apos; (as in &quot;sEt&quot;), and sometimes &apos;oo&apos;. The use of consonants implies using the words of the composition used during singing.</p><p>(9) The greater the correctness of the notes (as JI frequencies), the lower the Harmonic Entropy.</p><p>As regards the math of Harmonic Entropy, I am acutely aware of my ignorance.

In any case, the alap is a series of various degrees of dissonances resolved into a series of various degrees of consonances. Perhaps all music is like that, in some way or the other, in the ultimate analysis.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=50739 href="#50739">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2003 2:28:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ***Hello Haresh!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I&apos;m a little confused about this and I&apos;m sure that Paul<br/>Erlich<br/>&gt; will get to it after he&apos;s read 400 more posts :) but Harmonic<br/>Entropy<br/>&gt; implies *harmony*, no?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, I guess with raga this would mean a pitch against a drone??<br/>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure there is such a thing as *horizontal* Harmonic Entropy, or<br/>&gt; Melodic Harmonic Entropy, but Paul can and should correct me if I&apos;m<br/>&gt; wrong...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>You&apos;re right, Joseph.
