I&apos;ll see.  I may have to wait until I&apos;m<br/>more certainly confident with my own quartet and make it myself.<br/>I&apos;ll see if I can talk to Power Play the current gold-medalists<br/>(conicidentally from my district) when I see them at convention<br/>next month.  On a side note, I&apos;ve heard their lead accused of<br/>sometimes singing a tad sharp, indicating that even the best of<br/>the best are not exactly scientifically ideal.  Though they are<br/>amazing, the pickiest barbershoppers still think there&apos;s room for<br/>improvement.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Sethares&quot; &lt;sethares@e...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dave wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t think anyone doubts that barbershop _harmony_ is<br/>justly<br/>&gt; intoned,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have heard many people doubt this.
