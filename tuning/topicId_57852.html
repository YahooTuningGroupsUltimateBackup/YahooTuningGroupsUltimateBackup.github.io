I have a question and I hope somebody can help me.</p><p>I am looking for a reference (article or book) in which I can find something about the (just) tuning of chords. If for example 5-limit just intonation is considered, most people agree (I think) that a major triad should be tuned as 1-5/4-3/2. But if then a dominant seventh chord is considered it is not so obvious if this should be tuned as 1-5/4-3/2-9/5 or as 1-5/4-3/2-16/9 or even something else, right? And in more complicated chords the ambiguity seems even greater.</p><p>My question is now, is there ever written something about his? Can one say that there is no unambiguous theory about the tuning of chords?<br/>Thanks for your help.</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Aline Honingh</p></div><h3><a id=57853 href="#57853">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2005 3:43:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aline Honingh &lt;ahoningh@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am looking for a reference (article or book) in which I can find<br/>&gt; something about the (just) tuning of chords.

And in more<br/>&gt; complicated chords the ambiguity seems even greater.</p><p>One answer is to tune to whatever sounds right. All three seventh<br/>chords are the same in 12-equal, and so the question does not arise.<br/>Since (9/5)/(16/9) = 81/80, we would not worry about the difference<br/>between 9/5 and 16/9 in meantone; in other tuning systems, there is a<br/>difference, and it might depend on whether you want a subdominant note<br/>in the V7 chord, which one could claim is required for a true dominant<br/>seventh. In meantone, of course, you *also* have the choice of<br/>C-E-G-A# as a tuning, the German sixth, which is an approximate<br/>1-4/3-3/2-7/4 and it is a very nice chord indeed. It gets used<br/>relatively rarely in &quot;common practice&quot;, I think, only because in the<br/>meantone era people were usually restricted to twelve notes on fixed<br/>intonation instruments. Needless to say, the question of whether to<br/>use E## or Gbb for an 11/8 doesn&apos;t even arise. In 31-et, they are in<br/>fact the same note.</p><p>My own practice is to use 1-5/4-3/2-7/4 a heck of a lot, but then I&apos;m<br/>not usually messing about with tonic-dominant.</p></div><h3><a id=57854 href="#57854">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2005 3:53:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; One answer is to tune to whatever sounds right.</p><p>Let me expand on that:</p><p>(1) Use 1-5/4-3/2-7/4 if you want the most harmonious, blended chord.</p><p>(2) Use 1-5/4-3/2-9/5 for a fairly harmonious 5-limit chord; it has<br/>a 9/5 from 1, and a 6/5 from 3/2.</p><p>(3) Use 1-5/4-3/2-16/9 if it is a V7 chord and it is important for the<br/>subdominant to be a chord element.</p></div><h3><a id=57856 href="#57856">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2005 5:54:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aline Honingh wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am looking for a reference (article or book) in which I can find<br/>&gt; something about the (just) tuning of chords.</p><p>If there&apos;s not one, there jolly well should be.

And in more<br/>&gt; complicated chords the ambiguity seems even greater.</p><p>As Gene said in another reply, there are three ways to play a seventh chord. This is my own opinion of when to use those three chords:</p><p>1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 (0 17 31 43 in 53-tone): the non-resolving natural seventh, the kind of chord barbershop quartets can end a tune on. An example would be the &quot;and many more&quot; coda on &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, consisting of the pitches 3/2 5/3 3/2 7/4. Very important in jazz and blues, and if you add 7/3 (65), you get that famous chord from Jimi Hendrix&apos;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.</p><p>1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9 (0 17 31 44) will most likely will resolve to a major on the fourth, 4/3 5/3 2/1 (22 39 53), since 16/9 is a perfect fourth higher than 4/3.</p><p>1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5 (0 17 31 45): This one would have to be connected with the minor third, 6/5. This could be the middle chord in the progression I-VI7-ii.</p><p>Ninths, elevenths, thirteenths, sixths, suspended chords... I&apos;m a long way from figuring those out. But hopefully I&apos;ll put up a list of oud/fretless guitar chords in the Files section before too long. I use 53-tone as an easy reference, and go as far as 11-limit right now. One of my favorites is 1/1 11/9 3/2 11/6 (0 15 31 46) typically on E half-flat, a neutral seventh, which can also be found in the Arabic maqams Iraq, Rast, Husayni and Sikah.</p></div><h3><a id=57859 href="#57859">ðŸ”—</a>pgreenhaw@nypl.org</h3><span>4/5/2005 8:53:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>__________________________________________</p><p>-3/2 5/3 3/2 7/4.
