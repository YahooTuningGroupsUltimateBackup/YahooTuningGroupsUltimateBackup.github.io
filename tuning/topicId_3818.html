Try to add a fourth layer, and you will have overlaps. That is<br/>why an oblique view would be necessary.</p><p>&gt;Has any consensus been reached on the relative sizes of these?<br/>&gt;I stated earlier that p*ln(p) was the relative distance for prime p but<br/>&gt;later realised that this ratio refers to something slightly different,<br/>&gt;namely how often each prime should be present (inversely).</p><p>In the case where there is one axis for each _odd_ rather than for each<br/>_prime_ , I have given my reasons for making the length of each connection<br/>proportional to the log of the odd limit of the ratio. Erv Wilson, the<br/>undisputed lattice king, uses one axis for each odd, and the unfortunate<br/>result is that every note is duplicated an infinite number of times in the<br/>lattice. However, using the shortest path in this lattice (with the lengths<br/>I suggest) gives you a good measure of consonance. This was discussed very<br/>extensively before you joined -- check the archives.</p></div>
