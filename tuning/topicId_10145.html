Comments posted and attributed to me in Digest Number 645, were a<br/>copy of my intended &quot;off-list&quot; mail to Mark.<br/>It may have been my fault that they were sent to the list, as I was<br/>replying remotely whilst away in Dublin.<br/>I apologise for the misdirection as it should have gone only to Mark.</p><p>3.
