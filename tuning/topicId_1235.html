The ET that pianos have been suffering for<br/>the last 100 years is a compromise that we didn&apos;t realize was made, since it<br/>was the only thing going.  However, that is changing.  I have a growing number<br/>of customers that prefer the well tempered sound.  With the advent of the<br/>modern tuning computers, putting a piano in a different temperament is just as<br/>easy as 12 ET. (aurally, 12 TET is the most difficult tuning there is, while<br/>1/4 MT is child&apos;s play.)</p><p>&gt;For my ears,<br/>&gt;putting the piano into a harmonious tuning suddenly turns<br/>&gt;the instrument into a HARMONIOUS instrument as well as<br/>&gt;a smooth sounding complex subtly impressionistic almost<br/>&gt;harmonious musical instrument - &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>    Right on, right on, right on.  Dave&apos;s recordings of his piano demonstrates<br/>the harmonious nature he is talking about.  The differences between ET and MT<br/>are profound.</p><p>&gt;a questioning<br/>&gt;of the satisfactoriness of 12 TET - the piano may have more<br/>&gt;life ahead than it has had up to the present time.</p><p>This is the crux of the &quot;Temperament Revival&quot;.( it is more than a fin de<br/>siecle convulsion!)  Talking about tunings only raises some interest, but<br/>hearing the sounds of a Steinway concert piano in earlier tunings really makes<br/>converts out of many.<br/>   The classical piano world is just now waking up to the fact that the piano<br/>was not intonated in the past as it is today.  Inroads are being made, i.e. I<br/>have been asked to give two classes in alternate temperaments for the national<br/>convention of the Piano Technicians Guild this summer, and I intend to present<br/>it as &quot;Temperaments for the 21st Century&quot;.  All of this hypergalactic, prime<br/>wahzoo, nth based tuning is above the average tuners head, (Lattice anyone?),<br/>but it is part of the expanding world of intonation and will also be a growing<br/>field of interest to musicians  (and hopefully composers).<br/>   Our well tempered Beethoven CD is slowing moving into university libraries,<br/>and there are others on the way.  At Vanderbilt, we have several pianos that<br/>are now kept in the Victorian style of tuning, ( which is a slightly &quot;bent&quot;<br/>ET, which gives tonal color to the keys without overtly tossing Schoenberg to<br/>the wolves). I honestly think that 12 ET is going to stay, but it is going to<br/>have to move over and make room for some of its more harmonious brethren.<br/>(Now, if I can just get Garth Brooks to use it on the next CD,  I&apos;ll have a<br/>grappling hook on the freight train!)<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=1268 href="#1268">ðŸ”—</a>hmiller@xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>3/4/1999 6:27:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 3 Mar 1999 19:41:50 EST, <a href="mailto:A440A@aol.com">A440A@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;This is the crux of the &quot;Temperament Revival&quot;.( it is more than a fin de<br/>&gt;siecle convulsion!)

I think that hearing Owen Jorgensen perform classical piano music<br/>in the original tunings back in the early 80&apos;s was one of the events that<br/>led to my interest in alternate tuning. If I had a real piano instead of a<br/>Clavinova (as if I&apos;d have room for one!), I&apos;d have it tuned to a<br/>well-tempered scale of some sort.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
