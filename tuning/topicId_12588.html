I&apos;m more for &quot;plurality&quot; myself, and<br/>&gt; toleration of other peoples&apos; opinions and HEY, even PERSONALITIES!<br/>&gt; There have been onerous (one-groups, get it) postings from various<br/>&gt; people from time-to-time, but &quot;big deal.&quot; Like they say &quot;get over<br/>&gt; it.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe I&apos;ve lived in New York too long, but it doesn&apos;t PHASE :) me at<br/>&gt; all, as long as we&apos;re all learning something and at least trying to<br/>&gt; communicate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do note that &quot;newjustintonation&quot; is a little more &quot;exclusionary&quot;<br/>&gt; than the &quot;Tuning List.&quot;  I was not allowed to immediately join, as in<br/>&gt; this list.  I supposed the idea is to &quot;filter out&quot; certain<br/>&gt; troublesome individuals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, for me, I AM, a bonefide card-carrying just intonationist!<br/>&gt; I have my card right here!  I have several pieces in just intonation!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m hoping my application will be approved, and, certainly, everybody<br/>&gt; is free to start their own groups but, for the sake of diversity of<br/>&gt; viewpoints, I would urge everybody who posts to Kraig&apos;s site (and I<br/>&gt; hope they DO) will make similar postings over here, so that people<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have to constantly go &quot;back and forth&quot; and to enhance the<br/>&gt; plurality of the group.  Well, that&apos;s my admittedly &quot;biased&quot; opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; __________ ____ __ __ __<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
