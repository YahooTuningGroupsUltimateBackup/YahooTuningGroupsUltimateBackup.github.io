The statement may sound slightly facetious, but Mr. Hartke<br/>means it.</p><p>  Typically, fledgling composers are taught harmony and counterpoint<br/>according to more or less rigid, traditional rules, with dissonances<br/>carefully chosen and studiously resolved. But when they write in<br/>contemporary harmonic idioms and a nifty dissonance is called for,<br/>young composers are too quick to think that any old combination of<br/>pitches that produce some abrasive snarl of a chord will do. Not so,<br/>says Mr. Hartke, and it&apos;s a point he impresses on composition majors at<br/>the University of Southern California.</p><p>  &quot;I spend a lot of time with students on clarifying harmony,&quot; he said.<br/>&quot;I try to make them understand that even if you are writing post-tonal<br/>music you have to think about voice-leading issues.&quot; Write nasty music,<br/>Mr. Hartke would say. Go haywire if you choose, but make the pitches<br/>matter.</p><p>  His own works provide arresting examples of what he teaches. However<br/>raucous, impish, jerky, fanciful or finespun a passage in a Hartke<br/>composition, notes combine in dynamic ways, textures are lucid, details<br/>are telling and colors are vividly applied. That is why Mr. Hartke,<br/>whose Third Symphony will be given its premiere run by Lorin Maazel and<br/>the New York Philharmonic beginning on Sept. 18 at Avery Fisher Hall,<br/>has been widely praised for his excellent craftsmanship. Almost every<br/>time I hear a Hartke piece on a contemporary-music program, it&apos;s the<br/>one that startles, engages and stays with me the most.</p><p>  Intrigued? Try Mr. Hartke&apos;s Violin Concerto, performed by the<br/>Riverside Symphony with Michelle Makarski as soloist on a 1998 New<br/>World CD, which also includes Mr. Hartke&apos;s Second Symphony.</p><p>  The concerto begins with the crackling, almost unnerving sounds of<br/>four percussionists banging drumsticks in unison patterns. The<br/>violinist soon enters, doodling around like some country fiddler,<br/>except that the skittish solo line is so rhythmically charged and<br/>audaciously all over the place that the music sounds utterly serious as<br/>well.</p><p>  That the concerto is not going to be merely some postmodern romp<br/>becomes clear when, out of nowhere, the orchestral strings play eerily<br/>dissonant stirrings (yes, those nifty Hartke dissonances) in high<br/>harmonics. Ominous stuttering brass chords emerge in the background,<br/>sounding as if they had wandered in from a middle-period Stravinsky<br/>piece, until the restless violin section begins a full-frontal<br/>encounter with the suspiciously breezy soloist.</p><p>  In this concerto, as in most of his works (the bracing piano quartet<br/>&quot;The King of the Sun&quot;; the modern-day biblical &quot;Sons of Noah,&quot; scored<br/>with wondrous eclecticism for soprano and quartets of flutes, guitars<br/>and bassoons), Mr. Hartke seems intent on surprising and amusing us<br/>simultaneously. Bernard Holland aptly described this effect in a New<br/>York Times review of &quot;The Horse With the Lavender Eye,&quot; for violin,<br/>clarinet and piano: &quot;Mr. Hartke works hard to impress us, to make us<br/>think, &grave;There&apos;s a clever fellow.&apos; He does and he is.&quot;</p><p>  Over the years Mr. Hartke, 51, has had major works performed by the<br/>Los Angeles Philharmonic, the London Symphony, the Moscow State<br/>Philharmonic and other leading ensembles. But for whatever reason<br/>(lingering antipathy between the music scenes on the East and West<br/>Coasts?), New Yorkers have not had as many chances to hear his music.<br/>That will change next month.</p><p>  The major event will be the new symphony, which was commissioned by<br/>the Philharmonic and features the four vocalists of the Hilliard<br/>Ensemble. On Sept. 21, the Hilliard singers will perform two major<br/>Hartke works written for them, &quot;Tituli&quot; and &quot;Cathedral in the Thrashing<br/>Rain,&quot; at Merkin Concert Hall. Around then ECM will release the<br/>Hilliard&apos;s new recording of those works, and the same week, Naxos will<br/>issue a Hartke CD featuring the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman and the<br/>Iris Chamber Orchestra in &quot;Landscape With Blues,&quot; a concerto for<br/>clarinet and orchestra.</p><p>  Mr. Hartke received the Philharmonic commission just 18 months ago.<br/>The orchestra suggested, but did not insist, that since the performance<br/>would fall close to the second anniversary of Sept. 11, Mr. Hartke<br/>might want to touch on the occasion in some way, as John Adams did last<br/>September in &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls.&quot; Coincidentally, Mr.<br/>Hartke was a member of the jury that awarded Mr. Adams&apos;s work the 2003<br/>Pulitzer Prize for music.</p><p>  Mr. Hartke wanted to write a symphony that dealt with Sept. 11 in some<br/>manner, but he was not happy with the initial results.</p><p>  &quot;It was coming out like a big overblown statement,&quot; he said, &quot;a New<br/>York Philharmonic piece instead of a Stephen Hartke piece.&quot;</p><p>His composer colleague Joan Tower cautioned him about succumbing to the<br/>grandeur of a major commission. &quot;I thought incorporating a text into<br/>the work would help,&quot; he said. &quot;I found out that the Hilliard Ensemble<br/>was available. Then I remembered this text I had long wanted to set.&quot;</p><p>  The text was &quot;The Ruin,&quot; an Old English elegy from the eighth or ninth<br/>century, which Mr. Hartke first encountered in an undergraduate<br/>literature class at Yale. The poet describes the ruins of a Roman city,<br/>possibly Bath, and contrasts the observed decay with the imagined<br/>splendor of what must have been. The poem &quot;does not moralize,&quot; Mr.<br/>Hartke said, but rather &quot;celebrates the creative spirit of the city&apos;s<br/>vanished residents.&quot;</p><p>  Mr. Hartke has always seemed constitutionally incapable of writing<br/>overblown or grandiose music. His language is far too tart, incisive<br/>and economical for that. His harmonic thinking was strongly influenced<br/>by his graduate studies with George Rochberg at the University of<br/>Pennsylvania. At the time, postwar serialist composers claimed the<br/>intellectual high ground and dominated many influential university<br/>music departments. Mr. Rochberg had broken away and begun to write<br/>works in a neo-Romantic vein.</p><p>  During his university years, Mr. Hartke said, there seemed to be &quot;a<br/>mad rush to turn music into an academic discipline along the lines of<br/>the sciences.&quot;</p><p>  &quot;I like to say they were being scientistic, since what they did<br/>mimicked science but wasn&apos;t science,&quot; he added. &quot;Our generation was<br/>made to feel we had to come to grips with 12-tone music. We had a<br/>psychic investment in it. I have to say my students today don&apos;t feel<br/>any such obligation. Back then we would have considered them yahoos.<br/>But my students have a lot of honesty.&quot;</p><p>  Still, Mr. Hartke&apos;s musical language is spiked with astringent<br/>harmony, and his impetuous thematic lines often zigzag in ways that<br/>echo the 12-tone idiom. Does he consider himself a tonal composer?</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered without hesitation. &quot;Music that makes sense to me<br/>has a tonal glue. You need to feel that the pitches have working<br/>relationships to other pitches hierarchically. I have a sense that all<br/>my pieces have a key, which doesn&apos;t mean I can identify it.&quot;</p><p>  Mr. Hartke freely admits that he does not like 12-tone music, even<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s works in that style. Yet while he sticks it to the<br/>serialists in his dynamic harmonic language, you may also sense a<br/>composer working out the impact of their challenging aesthetic on his<br/>own hearing.</p><p>  The myriad styles Mr. Hartke heard as a Manhattan-raised baby boomer<br/>strongly imprinted his ear, he says. Critics have pointed to the<br/>influence of Stravinsky, bebop, rock, Balinese gamelan music and the<br/>lush-textured Minimalism of the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen. Maybe<br/>so.</p><p>  &quot;But I&apos;m not a jazzer,&quot; Mr. Hartke said. &quot;And I don&apos;t really like rock<br/>music very much, though it was all around when I grew up and my music<br/>totally reflects my experience as a listener. I just happen to write<br/>music about my listening experience.&quot;</p><p>  With notable exceptions, like the clarinet concerto, which has clearly<br/>jazzy elements, Mr. Hartke&apos;s work rarely replicates any specific<br/>musical style. &quot;A composer&apos;s job is to transcend the models,&quot; he said.<br/>&quot;There is nothing Anglo-Saxon about my new symphony.&quot;</p><p>  As an example of a composer who ingeniously absorbed yet transcended<br/>diverse musical influences, Mr. Hartke picks, of all people, Haydn.<br/>Haydn inherited &quot;a rich variety of different affects, of expressive<br/>musical characters,&quot; Mr. Hartke said. Think about it: Germanic<br/>counterpoint, Italian opera, the bygone but still popular Rococo style,<br/>Austro-German folk music, the sacred-music tradition of the Roman<br/>Catholic Church, even the Viennese craze for Turkish music. But Haydn<br/>juggled these elements into a new form of expression.</p><p>  &quot;Composers are at the same moment today, trying to juggle the rich<br/>inheritance of modernism, world music and pop,&quot; Mr. Hartke said.<br/>&quot;Except it&apos;s no longer taboo to cross boundaries. We can sit back,<br/>enjoy it all and let it come out through our personal filters.&quot;</p><p>  Mr. Hartke&apos;s increasing East Coast presence was to have included the<br/>premiere next summer of &quot;Boule de Suif, or The Good Whore,&quot; a<br/>full-length opera with a libretto by Philip Littell, adapted from the<br/>short story by Guy de Maupassant. This production has already been<br/>advertised by the Glimmerglass opera in Cooperstown, N.Y. But because<br/>of a health concern within his family, Mr. Hartke cannot complete the<br/>opera on schedule, he said. Since Glimmerglass&apos;s 2005 season is already<br/>set, the premiere has been put off until 2006.</p><p>  Mr. Hartke is so far pleased with his progress on the opera, a tale of<br/>10 travelers fleeing the Prussian advance at the end of the<br/>Franco-Prussian War. &quot;Trying to get out of town with their wealth,&quot; Mr.<br/>Hartke said, &quot;they find themselves in the company of a famous<br/>prostitute and wind up using her to secure their release.&quot;</p><p>  Thinking back to our discussion of transcending musical influences,<br/>Mr. Hartke reports that there is &quot;nothing remotely 19th-century French&quot;<br/>about the work&apos;s harmonic language. Instead, listeners can expect lots<br/>of those good Hartke dissonances.</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist</p><p> &quot;Welcome and explore and inquire into everything, new or old, that comes<br/>your way, and then build your own music on whatever your inner life has been able<br/>to take in and offer you back again.&quot; - Henry Cowell</p><p>&quot;Music is by no means like the other arts, namely a copy of the Ideas, but a<br/>copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas. For this<br/>reason, the effect of music is so very much more powerful and penetrating than is<br/>that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow, but music<br/>of the essence.&quot; - Schopenhauer, _The World as Will and Representation_</p><p>&quot;His music, far from being in the background of my life, was in the<br/>foreground.  It was he as a musician who accomplished what I dreamed of, and<br/>I followed as well as I could with the inferior power of words.  The ear is<br/>purer than the eye, which reads only relative meaning into words. Whereas<br/>the distillation of experience into pure sound, a state of music, is<br/>timeless and absolute.&quot; -Anais Nin on her brother Joaquin Nin-Culmell</p><p>&quot;...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than stasis. ...<br/>improvisation is about a constant change.&quot; - Steve Beresford</p><p>improvisation: &quot;a process of liberation, a working around the assumptions<br/>that define our civilization, and the results are open-ended.&quot; - John Berndt</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Any sufficiently advanced music is indistinguishable from noise&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;(after Arthur C. Clarke&apos;s aphorism that any sufficiently advanced</p><p>&gt; &gt;technology is indistinguisable from magic.) - John Chalmers, in response<br/>to the quote &quot;the difference between music and noise is all in your head&quot;</p><p> &quot;We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dream. Wandering by<br/>lone sea breakers, and sitting by desolate streams. World losers and world<br/>forsakers, for whom the pale moon gleams. Yet we are movers and the shakers of<br/>the world forever it seems.&quot;<br/>-&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.quoteland.com/author.asp?AUTHOR_ID=708">http://www.quoteland.com/author.asp?AUTHOR_ID=708</a>&quot;&gt;Arthur<br/>O&apos;Shaunessey&lt;/A&gt;</p></div>
