The New Grove&apos;s Dictionary<br/>of Music and Musicians mentions the use of a stretched octave and gives<br/>measurements of the scale steps:</p><p>0 cents<br/>257 cents<br/>494 cents<br/>725 cents<br/>969 cents<br/>1217 cents</p><p>William Sethares, in &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot; states,</p><p>&quot;Each Gamelan is tuned differently.  Hence the pelog of one Gamelan may<br/>differ substantially from the pelog of another.  Tunings tend not to have<br/>exact 2:1 octaves; rather, the octaves can be either stretched or<br/>compressed.  Each &apos;octave&apos; of a Gamelan may differ from other &apos;octaves&apos; of<br/>the same Gamelan.&quot;</p><p>He sites a book which studies more than 30 complete Gamelans,</p><p>&quot;W.

I find things like his point about the bronze rising in<br/>pitch over time: &quot;Another factor that should be considered is that<br/>bronze rise in pitch over time, and the smaller keys rise faster than<br/>the larger ones -- so the stretching may not be a part of the initial<br/>tuning design,&quot; fascinating.</p><p>Awhile back Joe Monzo wrote &quot;what tuning sounds best in any particular<br/>instant is highly dependent on many contextual factors.&quot; Not only do I<br/>happen to wholeheartedly agree with this, but I also think it&apos;s fair<br/>to say that some of those &quot;contextual factors&quot; can be disconcertingly<br/>circuitous twists of happenstance.</p><p>To the same post of Joe&apos;s that I mention above, John Link responded:<br/>&quot;I have found with my vocal quintet that there is hardly ever any<br/>disagreement about whether we&apos;re really in tune. So I don&apos;t think that<br/>it is very much a matter of taste. I believe that there actually is<br/>such a thing as good intonation, and that it is not such a subjective<br/>notion as one might think.&quot;</p><p>While I find it easy enough to see (and agree) with the tenants that<br/>make such a point of view fly, I also almost completely disagree with<br/>it... It seems to me that what is easily in agreement in one<br/>particular musical context, or one particular tuning paradigm, may be<br/>anything but in another. I think that music -- and all the structural<br/>articulations contained therein -- are as flexible as we are talented<br/>driven and inspired... that talented, driven, and inspired people<br/>always seem to find their way through  the maze and tangle of what<br/>will work and what won&apos;t work... of what&apos;s musically right and what&apos;s<br/>musically wrong.</p><p>Do music&apos;s (often quirky) tools -- i.e., instruments and those who use<br/>them -- shape music&apos;s structures to a greater degree than a<br/>fundamental (Yasser-esque) art of space (I believe &quot;raumkunst&quot; was the<br/>word he used), or are they more of an interleaved affair - does the<br/>latter even exist for that matter...</p><p>While I personally see little hope (or need) of dragging anything<br/>definitive out of a sociological mire of righteousness and<br/>subjectiveness, these are questions that I do find fascinating, and<br/>especially with regards to how they sit in the subject of intonation<br/>and tuning.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=6382 href="#6382">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/1999 4:51:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt;While I find it easy enough to see (and agree) with the tenants that<br/>make such a point of view fly,</p><p>&quot;tenants&quot; should have (obviously) read tenets - &quot;the tenets that make<br/>such a point of view fly,&quot;</p><p>sorry,<br/>Dan</p><p>...awhile back I typed boarders for borders... must have some sort of<br/>a suppressed landlord fixation or something...</p></div>
