This reminds<br/>me of calculations by me and my father showing how electronic<br/>energy levels produce the syntonic comma among other things. Here is how:</p><p>Delta E is the difference between two electronic energy levels of the<br/>hydrogen atom. This is proportional to</p><p>Delta E (hi level minus low level) ~ (1 / low^2)-(1 / hi^2)</p><p>If hi is 2 and low is 1, the interval is 1- 1/4 = 3/4<br/>If hi is 3 and low is 2, the interval is 1/4- 1/9 = 5/36<br/>If hi is 3 and low is 1, the interval is 1- 1/9 = 8/9<br/>If hi is 4 and low is 1, the interval is 1- 1/16= 15/16<br/>...<br/>If hi is 9 and low is 1, the interval is 1- 1/81 = 80/81</p><p>Interesting, no?<br/>Oz.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@tonalsoft.com">monz@tonalsoft.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 19 Aral&iuml;&iquest;&half;k 2005 Pazartesi 10:35<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Aristoxenos and 144-EDO (was: Arabian comma dispute)</p><p>&gt; Hi Yahya,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I trust your good intentions, and I think you have<br/>&gt; &gt; an unsurpassed reputation on this list for musically<br/>&gt; &gt; relevant accuracy.

However, absent the time to learn and<br/>&gt; &gt; master the Greek of his day, the next-best thing<br/>&gt; &gt; must always be a good translation by a subject-<br/>&gt; &gt; matter expert who has those language skills I lack,<br/>&gt; &gt; and I&apos;m guessing that expert would be yourself.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So I will certainly write a proper study of that page<br/>&gt; &gt; on my to-do list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course i&apos;m going to tell you that my Aristoxenos<br/>&gt; webpage is worth the effort of &quot;a proper study&quot;. :)<br/>&gt; I just have to apologize again that it *will* take<br/>&gt; so much effort, because i really need to do a lot of<br/>&gt; serious editing of that page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, besides the bits and pieces on my webpage,<br/>&gt; there are two full English translations of Aristoxenos<br/>&gt; available:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Barker, Andrew.  1989.<br/>&gt;  _Greek Musical Writings_,<br/>&gt;  volume 2: &apos;Harmonic and Acoustic Theory&apos;.<br/>&gt;  Translated and edited.<br/>&gt;  Cambridge University Press, New York.<br/>&gt;  [Contains complete English translation of Aristoxenus<br/>&gt;  _Elementa harmonica_ in vol 2, p 126-184.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Macran, Henry Stewart.  1902.<br/>&gt;  _The Harmonics of Aristonexus_.<br/>&gt;  Edited with translation, notes, introduction, and index of words.<br/>&gt;  Clarendon Press, Oxford.<br/>&gt;  Reprinted 1974, Hildesheim; New York: G. Olms Verlag.<br/>&gt;  [Contains complete English translation.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Barker is the newer, more modern translation, and<br/>&gt; has the added benefit that along with Aristoxenos you<br/>&gt; also get *all* of the other ancient Greek musical writings.<br/>&gt; The drawback is that you won&apos;t buy it, because it&apos;s $180.<br/>&gt; Try a good university library.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Macran is the &quot;classic&quot; English edition, and also<br/>&gt; includes the complete Greek text. This should be quite<br/>&gt; easy to find in a library ... i&apos;ve even seen it in a<br/>&gt; few public libraries, and certainly every university<br/>&gt; will have it. I was going to say that you might even<br/>&gt; find a used copy online, but i see from Amazon that<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a new reprint of it, so now it goes for $65.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To the extent that pythagorean mathematics and the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;tuning by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the end of the procedure, that&apos;s true. But it also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; needs to be pointed out that the 144-edo tempered 4th<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is the familiar 12-edo one of 500 cents, which is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; largely inaudible discrepancy from the ~498 cents of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the pythagorean 4/3 ratio 4th.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The difference, 2 cents, is about the agreed<br/>&gt; &gt; limit of our ability to perceive.  However, I think<br/>&gt; &gt; your previous paragraph confuses the issue.  Let&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; disentangle the threads:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1.  You agreed that the pythagorean maths produces<br/>&gt; &gt; a wolf-4th, which I was guessing Aristoxenos was<br/>&gt; &gt; objecting to.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2.  You state, as justification for your theory that<br/>&gt; &gt; Aristoxenos meant 144-EDO, that its 4th is almost<br/>&gt; &gt; just, as far as our ears can tell.<br/>&gt; &gt; 3.  But you also state that Aristoxenos&apos; &quot;tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Points 2. and 3. are not compatible; either the last<br/>&gt; &gt; 4th is a wolf, or it isn&apos;t; if it&apos;s (almost) just, it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; a wolf.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m really going to have to read your page on<br/>&gt; &gt; Aristoxenos, aren&apos;t I?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You got point 3 wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Aristoxenos&apos;s* &quot;tuning by concords&quot; produces a series<br/>&gt; of 11 4ths and 5ths which are all considered to be concords.<br/>&gt; That can only be accomplished with a slight tempering of<br/>&gt; each 4th and 5th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As i stated, if the &quot;tuning by concords&quot; is done with<br/>&gt; *pythagorean* 4ths and 5ths (exact 4/3 and 3/2 ratios,<br/>&gt; respectively), then the 11th interval in the series is<br/>&gt; a wolf ... and it&apos;s a wolf-5th, not 4th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;Amendment from 2003.07.20&quot; section of my webpage<br/>&gt; opens with diagrams which show graphically the &quot;tuning<br/>&gt; by concords&quot; process. This link takes you right to it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm#144edo">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm#144edo</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The brilliant insight in Aristoxenos&apos;s &quot;tuning by concords&quot;<br/>&gt; -- if you accept the 144-edo interpretation or something<br/>&gt; close to it -- is that by tempering each 4th and 5th by<br/>&gt; only 2 cents, they still sound essentially the same as<br/>&gt; the pythagorean concords, but do not produce the wolf<br/>&gt; at the end, instead producing a final concord just like<br/>&gt; all the rest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As i&apos;ve said, i hesitate to give Aristoxenos the credit<br/>&gt; for this, because i am convinced that the Sumerians<br/>&gt; discovered it 2000 years before him, and that it filtered<br/>&gt; into Greek culture via Babylon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aristoxenos was certainly dealing in approximations,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as Partch so indignantly accused him of doing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Good on him!  ... if that served his musical purposes<br/>&gt; &gt; well enough.  But then how would he be thinking of<br/>&gt; &gt; an unprecedentedly fine division of the fourth?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A large part of Aristoxenos&apos;s program was to refute<br/>&gt; the traditional, well-established music-theory of the<br/>&gt; pythagoreans, in part because their mathematics were<br/>&gt; unable to describe the more subtle divisions of<br/>&gt; generic shades which Aristoxenos perceived to be in<br/>&gt; use among musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Archytas had been the first music-theorist to write<br/>&gt; about the 3 different genera (diatonic, chromatic,<br/>&gt; and enharmonic). But Archytas made only the second<br/>&gt; note from the top of the tetrachord a moveable one<br/>&gt; -- i.e., all 3 of his genera have same pitch at the<br/>&gt; top, bottom, and the note above the bottom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos criticized this and said that the<br/>&gt; enharmonic genus has its own small interval at the<br/>&gt; bottom of the tetrachord. He gives a nod of recognition<br/>&gt; to the harmonists, a school of non-pythagorean<br/>&gt; music-theorists who used _katapyknosis_ to divide<br/>&gt; larger intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But apparently what&apos;s going on here is that Aristoxenos<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to employ concepts derived from the then-new<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; geometry expounded by Euclid. He saw Euclidean geometry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as a way to measure divisions of irrational musical intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which the pythagorean mathematics before him were unable<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to deal with.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now that is interesting!  And those geometric<br/>&gt; &gt; methods permit, in principle, of arbitrary accuracy<br/>&gt; &gt; of measurement - simply draw your diagrams large<br/>&gt; &gt; enough, and you get the number of decimal places<br/>&gt; &gt; you want.  Of course, there ARE practical limits.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But given that Aristoxenos was impressed by the<br/>&gt; &gt; mensurational powers of the new geometry, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; surprised you say he was dealing in approximations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, he had to be, if he intended his musical system<br/>&gt; to be tempered, because the mathematics of his time<br/>&gt; was not able to deal with the irrational intervals<br/>&gt; of temperament in any way other than the use of geometry.<br/>&gt; Tempered intervals can only be represented exactly in<br/>&gt; numbers with the use of base-plus-exponent notation,<br/>&gt; which didn&apos;t come along until the 1600s (and was refined<br/>&gt; only a few years ago by yours truly and Gene Ward Smith<br/>&gt; into the &quot;monzo&quot; notation).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AFAIK, the scholar who first pointed out the geometrical<br/>&gt; aspect of Aristoxenos&apos;s theories is Malcolm Litchfield:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Litchfield, Malcolm.  1988.<br/>&gt;  &apos;Aristoxenus and Empiricism:<br/>&gt;  A Reevalutation Based on his Theories&apos;.<br/>&gt;  _Journal of Music Theory_, v 32 # 1, p 51-73.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (BTW, the character of Aristoxenos&apos;s two suriviving books<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to indicate that they were not written down by him,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but that they are notes written down by students attending<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; his lectures.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ouch!  But better than nothing.  I wonder if they<br/>&gt; &gt; were GOOD students?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently so ... the surviving texts are very detailed.<br/>&gt; And for the parts that are missing, we have Cleonides to<br/>&gt; fill in the gaps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The existing texts of Aristoxenos appear to be from<br/>&gt; two different periods in his career, one early and one<br/>&gt; late. They cover much of the same material, but the<br/>&gt; second book (the presumed later text) is a good deal<br/>&gt; more sophisticated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should also point out here that Aristoxenos&apos;s theories<br/>&gt; carried a great deal of weight in the ancient world:<br/>&gt; *every* subsequent Greek and Roman music-theorist whose<br/>&gt; work survives speaks of musical material in the Aristoxenean<br/>&gt; terms of the Lesser Perfect System, Greater Perfect System,<br/>&gt; Perfect Immutable System, and tetrachords with two fixed<br/>&gt; bounding notes and two moveable inner notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is true all the way up to Boethius, who lived more<br/>&gt; than 800 years after Aristoxenos -- and of course,<br/>&gt; Boethius&apos;s theories were perpetuated first by the<br/>&gt; Carolingian Franks c.800-1100, and then again by the<br/>&gt; Renaissance Italians in the 1500s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So by stripping away the Akkadian syllables, as i have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; done on my webpage, one can see the underlying Sumerian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; basis of all of the Babylonian mathematical texts.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And the essence of the math problems is already there<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the Sumerian.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A very nice deduction!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the link you have is for my webpage about the<br/>&gt; *simplified* Sumerian version of 12-edo. The older<br/>&gt; webpage i made about this has a 3-sexagesimal-place<br/>&gt; approximation, which obviously is more accurate still,<br/>&gt; and that page is the one where i have translations of<br/>&gt; an actual Babylonian mathematical tablet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/sumerian-tuning.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/sumerian-tuning.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should also mention that someone, quite a while back,<br/>&gt; sent me an email about this page explaining that these<br/>&gt; math problems were not about tuning, but were about<br/>&gt; farming acreage or something like that. I&apos;ve been really<br/>&gt; busy and just filed that away for later perusal, but<br/>&gt; thought that it should be mentioned here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robson, whose book has the translations of these and<br/>&gt; hundreds of other Babylonian math texts, surmises that<br/>&gt; they deal with the measurement of bricks. I&apos;m inclined<br/>&gt; to agree with that, as the Sumerian and Babylonian<br/>&gt; civilizations were entirely based on their ability<br/>&gt; to use the clay-mud at their disposal to make bricks,<br/>&gt; which they then used to build dams, canals, roads,<br/>&gt; temples, and cities. There were no other natural<br/>&gt; resources available to them -- neither stone nor wood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find it *very* interesting that all of the common<br/>&gt; small musical intervals (&quot;commas&quot;) are also found in<br/>&gt; Babylonian texts concerning weights and measures.<br/>&gt; Ratios such as 81/80 (the syntonic-comma) and 128/125<br/>&gt; (the diesis) pop up as discrepancies between different<br/>&gt; systems of measurement for such things as silver, barley,<br/>&gt; or standard brick sizes for different city-states.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
