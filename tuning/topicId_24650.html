I was responding to Joe&apos;s implication<br/>that I would freak at HP being considered Western. I know full well<br/>the influences on Partch, and they weren&apos;t just eastern, but also<br/>african and native American and a host of others. He not only heard<br/>Chinese lullabies from his mother&apos;s singing, but continued listening<br/>when, as a single young man living in the Bay area, frequently<br/>attended Chinese opera.</p><p>One of the other fascinating presentations in LA was Philip<br/>Blackburn&apos;s. In addition to tracing HPs life, he did something quite<br/>unique: he took all of the &apos;influences&apos; (or most of them) that HP had<br/>cited over his lifetime, made audio selections of parts of them, and<br/>then juxtaposed them (by cross-fading) with examples of the<br/>influences in Partch&apos;s own compositions. Indian vina playing, with<br/>glides and glissandos, sequeing to adapted viola in &quot;Li Po&quot; settings;<br/>chinese lullabies and folk melodies sequeing into the &quot;Hong Kong<br/>Music Hall&quot; section from &quot;The Bewitched&quot;. It was really a great<br/>illumination! I was happy to contribute a couple of examples to him<br/>from Partch&apos;s own record collection, including blues/folk singer<br/>Odetta, who came *this close* to being cast as the original Witch<br/>in &quot;The Bewitched&quot;.</p><p>Harry, if anything, was in his own universe.

No, Western music is<br/>pretty average on the Just -- Non-Just continuum, except for the fact that Western music is big<br/>on _harmony_ -- and harmony developed, at every stage, by musicians _breaking_ the rules<br/>that had been laid down based on music created in a previous era. When organum developed,<br/>no one sat down and said, &quot;well, which notes of the diatonic scale will go well together? Let&apos;s<br/>figure this out scientifically&quot;. No, even the ancient knowledge of ratios had never been applied to<br/>this problem, and that knowledge was lost for the time being anyway. But today, we clearly see<br/>that organum was 3-limit harmony. Similarly, in the 15th century when triadic/tertian harmony<br/>began to &quot;infiltrate&quot; &quot;serious&quot; Western music (probably an importation from Celtic folk styles),<br/>the paragons of scientific paradigms of music said &quot;no&quot; -- it broke all the &quot;laws&quot; that they had set<br/>forth -- but musical practice held sway over musical theory. It was only later, in the 16th century,<br/>that the first glimmers of understanding into the nature of sound, pitch, and what ratios had to do<br/>with tuning and harmony, as well as other basic principles of physics, began to dawn on Galileo<br/>and his contemporaries. And the fact that the already-standard triadic/tertian harmony was 5-limit<br/>harmony began to be discovered. And even then, no mathematician or scientist could predict<br/>what the future of Western music had in store -- the development of tonality in the 17th century,<br/>of homophony in the 18th, of chromatic harmony and enharmonic modulation (largely) in the<br/>19th, and of 12-tone atonality in the 20th. At every point in history, musicians led the way, and<br/>the ratio-wielding scientists and mathematicians could only follow. Music is too strong a cultural<br/>force to let scientific paradigms influence it to any significant extent . . . science was only useful in<br/>solving _practical_ problems, such as figuring out ways of building instruments . . . and<br/>mathematics was useful in developing tuning systems that would allow composers to do what<br/>they were trying to do without making unreasonable demands on performers.</p><p>Now, people who _did_ have a strong bias toward certain scientific paradigms included<br/>Helmholtz and Partch. If you want to weigh their contributions to music against, say, Schoenberg<br/>and Boulez, that&apos;s fair. But in your statement above, you&apos;re implying that Western music uses<br/>Just Intonation (which it doesn&apos;t) as a result of a cultural bias toward scientific systematization<br/>(which, as I see it, has influenced music about as much as nail polish).</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>6/9/2001 4:49:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Paul,</p><p>What are you using to post to the list: the web site or your own mail<br/>program?

Thanks, Paul, for stating this once again.<br/>It&apos;s a very important aspect of the development of<br/>Eurocentric music.</p><p>While there will always be an individual visionary<br/>voice (or several) among composers of any era, any<br/>historical period chosen at random up to about 1990<br/>or so exhibits, within circumscribed geographical or<br/>cultural boundaries, various categories of style into<br/>which the vast majority of composers fit their work.</p><p>(The situation is a bit different now, because we have<br/>pretty much the entire history and geography of recorded<br/>music available to us for not only listening but also<br/>reuse.)</p><p>Those stylistic considerations ensured that there would<br/>be some form of &quot;common vocabulary&quot; in harmonic practice<br/>from its inception, around 800 AD, until the 20th century.</p><p>The visionary composers were the ones who &quot;broke the rules&quot;<br/>in order to achieve a heretofore unknown expressive effect.<br/>(I give Beethoven, Wagner, and Schoenberg the highest marks<br/>here, but there were *lots* of others, beginning perhaps with<br/>Guillaume de Machaut - or even Perotin? -, Marchetto, etc.)</p><p>&gt; When organum developed, no one sat down and said, &quot;well,<br/>&gt; which notes of the diatonic scale will go well together?<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s figure this out scientifically&quot;. No, even the<br/>&gt; ancient knowledge of ratios had never been applied to<br/>&gt; this problem, and that knowledge was lost for the time<br/>&gt; being anyway.</p><p>Well... that&apos;s not entirely true.  As early as the<br/>_musica enchiriadis_<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/9th-11th/MUSENCH_TEXT.html">http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/9th-11th/MUSENCH_TEXT.html</a>&gt;,<br/>which I, going against the consensus (c. 900), date<br/>from the late 700s, there is a detailed theoretical<br/>consideration of how the notes of the available 18-tone<br/>gamut are to be put together into organum.</p><p>&gt; But today, we clearly see that organum was<br/>&gt; 3-limit harmony.</p><p>In general, yes... but I would debate the universal<br/>applicability of that, since I interpret what&apos;s in<br/>the _musica enchiriadis_ to hint at 5-limit usage.</p><p>And Boethius, c. 505 AD, clearly described with<br/>Greek-letter notation what were pseudo-5-limit scales,<br/>which differentiated the syntonic comma (~22 cents)<br/>but not the skhisma (~2 cents)... so they were actually<br/>in a form of skhismic temperament!  Around the time<br/>the _enchiriadis_ treatises were written, Boethius&apos;s<br/>book was elevated to the lofty status which it held<br/>in Eurocentric theory for a good 600 years, until the<br/>blatant recognition of 5-limit harmony by Odington,<br/>Ramos, et al.</p><p>(Sheesh... I really need to get on the ball and turn<br/>my papers on both of these into webpages.)</p><p>&gt; Similarly, in the 15th century when triadic/tertian<br/>&gt; harmony began to &quot;infiltrate&quot; &quot;serious&quot; Western music<br/>&gt; (probably an importation from Celtic folk styles),<br/>&gt; the paragons of scientific paradigms of music said<br/>&gt; &quot;no&quot; -- it broke all the &quot;laws&quot; that they had set<br/>&gt; forth -- but musical practice held sway over musical<br/>&gt; theory.

And<br/>&gt; the fact that the already-standard triadic/tertian<br/>&gt; harmony was 5-limit harmony began to be discovered.</p><p>Paul, this is a useful simplification, but it leaves out<br/>such lumanaries as Theinred of Dover (1200s), Walter<br/>Odington (c. 1316), Marchetto (1318) and a host of other<br/>predecessors.  They all spoke about tunings which did<br/>*not* follow the 3-limit paradigm, Odington specifically<br/>comparing the use of a &quot;major 3rd&quot; of 5/4 ratio (as 80/64)<br/>to one of 81/64.</p><p>(I also began working on an Odinton webpage back in Philly<br/>a few months ago... eventually it will turn up on my site.)</p><p>&gt; ... in your statement above, you&apos;re implying that Western<br/>&gt; music uses Just Intonation (which it doesn&apos;t) as a result<br/>&gt; of a cultural bias toward scientific systematization<br/>&gt; (which, as I see it, has influenced music about as<br/>&gt; much as nail polish).</p><p>Paul, your outlook on this really is very close to McLaren&apos;s,<br/>which surprised me.

How that exactly relates to his earlier<br/>&gt; &gt; music I dont know, maybe none, but the seed was planted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, this is absolutely true. I was responding to Joe&apos;s implication<br/>&gt; that I would freak at HP being considered Western. I know full well<br/>&gt; the influences on Partch, and they weren&apos;t just eastern, but also<br/>&gt; african and native American and a host of others. He not only heard<br/>&gt; Chinese lullabies from his mother&apos;s singing, but continued listening<br/>&gt; when, as a single young man living in the Bay area, frequently<br/>&gt; attended Chinese opera.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of the other fascinating presentations in LA was Philip<br/>&gt; Blackburn&apos;s. In addition to tracing HPs life, he did something quite<br/>&gt; unique: he took all of the &apos;influences&apos; (or most of them) that HP had<br/>&gt; cited over his lifetime, made audio selections of parts of them, and<br/>&gt; then juxtaposed them (by cross-fading) with examples of the<br/>&gt; influences in Partch&apos;s own compositions. Indian vina playing, with<br/>&gt; glides and glissandos, sequeing to adapted viola in &quot;Li Po&quot; settings;<br/>&gt; chinese lullabies and folk melodies sequeing into the &quot;Hong Kong<br/>&gt; Music Hall&quot; section from &quot;The Bewitched&quot;. It was really a great<br/>&gt; illumination! I was happy to contribute a couple of examples to him<br/>&gt; from Partch&apos;s own record collection, including blues/folk singer<br/>&gt; Odetta, who came *this close* to being cast as the original Witch<br/>&gt; in &quot;The Bewitched&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harry, if anything, was in his own universe.

I&apos;d signed off the list for a bit, but have<br/>come back. I guess I must be addicted to the tuning list, which is pretty<br/>funny considering how my brain glazes over when served with too much math.<br/>I&apos;d also been on the other list before it went up in flames, and found some<br/>of McLarens&apos; writings extremely thought provoking as to how much time and<br/>energy I ought to be spending with the numbers, so to speak.</p><p>I&apos;ve spent the bulk of my professional music making life in various folk<br/>music forms, Appalachian, Celtic and New England based fiddle music, French<br/>hurdy-gurdy music, klezmer, acoustic and bottleneck acoustic blues styles,<br/>to name a few of my passions/obsessions. All of these musics use<br/>microtonality, although many traditional players don&apos;t think or talk about<br/>it. But some do, although it&apos;s often to talk about &quot;playing the notes in<br/>between the cracks&quot; as opposed to expressing these ideas in ratios. When I<br/>came to study JI and microtonality, I joined this tuning list and microtonal<br/>world from that perspective. I&apos;d already spent much time training myself (or<br/>untraining as it were) to play those in between notes, and so it has been a<br/>helpful background with which to approach learning JI.</p><p>I would agree wholeheartedly with McLaren that we must not lose sight of the<br/>music, when we&apos;re getting wrapped up in the purely theoretical. There is<br/>much great music out there that is not 12 ET, but that is not thought about<br/>in scientific terms by its practitioners. On the other hand, I would like to<br/>believe that my current studies of learning to accurately produce 3,5,7,11<br/>etc limit intervals with my voice, fiddle, slide and fretless guitar are not<br/>for nought. To me, the particular usefulness of my current studies is that<br/>it is giving me a way to express microtonal ideas in a more concrete manner<br/>in notation of my own compositions or when communicating with other<br/>musicians.</p><p>Without wishing at all to lose sight of the music, I also have come to<br/>appreciate the inherent beauty in the numbers and lattice systems. Yow, did<br/>I really just say/write that? I guess I did, I think it&apos;s the fact that I<br/>just had a huge revelation this weekend, with the help of WA Mathieus&apos;<br/>Harmonic Experience, regarding all those damn numbers in the fractions, and<br/>why and how they came about to be those particular numbers. Hmmm. Perhaps<br/>the usefulness in the numbers is the doors to other possibilities that they<br/>might open up. Then, play the sounds and let the ears decide!</p><p>&gt; Just a thought, and I have to admit that McLaren makes me THINK in<br/>&gt; ways I hadn&apos;t before...</p><p>Me too, and I think we can all grow by opening ourselves up to think about<br/>things in ways that we haven&apos;t thought about them in the past.

No, even the<br/>&gt; &gt; ancient knowledge of ratios had never been applied to<br/>&gt; &gt; this problem, and that knowledge was lost for the time<br/>&gt; &gt; being anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well... that&apos;s not entirely true.  As early as the<br/>&gt; _musica enchiriadis_<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/9th-11th/MUSENCH_TEXT.html">http://www.music.indiana.edu/tml/9th-11th/MUSENCH_TEXT.html</a>&gt;,<br/>&gt; which I, going against the consensus (c. 900), date<br/>&gt; from the late 700s, there is a detailed theoretical<br/>&gt; consideration of how the notes of the available 18-tone<br/>&gt; gamut are to be put together into organum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But today, we clearly see that organum was<br/>&gt; &gt; 3-limit harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In general, yes... but I would debate the universal<br/>&gt; applicability of that, since I interpret what&apos;s in<br/>&gt; the _musica enchiriadis_ to hint at 5-limit usage.</p><p>Huh? I&apos;ll have to look at what you have there, but it was my understanding that organum<br/>harmony consisted exclusively of parallel fifths, fourths, and octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And Boethius, c. 505 AD, clearly described with<br/>&gt; Greek-letter notation what were pseudo-5-limit scales,<br/>&gt; which differentiated the syntonic comma (~22 cents)<br/>&gt; but not the skhisma (~2 cents)... so they were actually<br/>&gt; in a form of skhismic temperament!</p><p>But what does this have to do with the musical _practice_ of organum?</p><p>&gt; Paul, this is a useful simplification, but it leaves out<br/>&gt; such lumanaries as Theinred of Dover (1200s), Walter<br/>&gt; Odington (c. 1316), Marchetto (1318) and a host of other<br/>&gt; predecessors.  They all spoke about tunings which did<br/>&gt; *not* follow the 3-limit paradigm, Odington specifically<br/>&gt; comparing the use of a &quot;major 3rd&quot; of 5/4 ratio (as 80/64)<br/>&gt; to one of 81/64.</p><p>Sure, there are always lots of theorists contemplating all sorts of systems . . . but the<br/>relevant point is, what impact did they have on musical _practice_? Perhaps we are<br/>simply more inclined to remember those theorists who made a &quot;lucky guess&quot; and forget<br/>many others?</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... in your statement above, you&apos;re implying that Western<br/>&gt; &gt; music uses Just Intonation (which it doesn&apos;t) as a result<br/>&gt; &gt; of a cultural bias toward scientific systematization<br/>&gt; &gt; (which, as I see it, has influenced music about as<br/>&gt; &gt; much as nail polish).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul, your outlook on this really is very close to McLaren&apos;s,<br/>&gt; which surprised me.</p><p>If that&apos;s true, then Joseph must have seriously misunderstood McLaren, and McLaren of<br/>course has seriously misunderstood me.</p></div>
