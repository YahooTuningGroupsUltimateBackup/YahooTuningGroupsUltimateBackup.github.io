Two other such commas are 625/624 and 325/324. 325/324 can be added to the 11-limit version of marvel, tempering out 225/224 and 385/384 to get 13-limit marvel. But it&apos;s also interesting to leave 11 out of it. From 225/224 we get that a 5-limit approximation for 7 is 225/224 * 7 = 225/32. Similarly from 325/324 we get a 5-limit approximation of 13 from  324/325 * 13 = 324/25. If we define the major/minor transformation of the 5-limit as the result of fixing 2 and 3 and replacing 5 by 24/5, then major/minor applied to 225/32 is 162/25, which is (324/25)/2. Similarly, major/minor applied to 324/25 is 225/16 = 2 * (225/32). 225/224 tells us that two 16/15 in a row are an approximate 8/7, and 325/324 tells us two 10/9 in a row are an approximate 16/13. Needless to say, major/minor applied to 16/15 is 10/9, and applied to 10/9 is 16/15.</p></div><h3><a id=100265 href="#100265">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2011 11:56:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>325/324 seems like a great comma. If you take 10/9 as the generator,<br/>and two of them gets you to 16/3, then three of them gets you to a<br/>flat 11/8, and four gets you to something looking like 32/21. If<br/>you&apos;re mixing it with 225/224, then 105/104 also ends up being a good<br/>fit, which Graham&apos;s temperament finder calls &quot;Supernatural&quot;. It&apos;s also<br/>got (16/13)^(1/2) as a generator, which suggests continuing the<br/>pattern to see what we might find. There were some really interesting<br/>higher-accuracy results, and some interesting lower-accuracy results.</p><p>(16/13)^(1/3) is kind of between negri and miracle and may imply 65/64<br/>being tempered out; not so great for you high accuracy people, can be<br/>interesting for the pun-happy folks out there. I didn&apos;t bother past<br/>having an exponent of 1/3 for (16/13), as I don&apos;t care much for scales<br/>with generators that are that small. Repeating the process for 13/8<br/>gives some interesting results:</p><p>(13/8)^(1/2) gives you an interesting sensi-ish sort of scale, which<br/>isn&apos;t really too good for sensi at all - the generator can be mapped<br/>to either 9/7 or 14/11 (or both to get you to rank 4), two of which<br/>get you to 13/8.</p><p>(13/8)^(1/3) could be taken to give you a sharp 7/6, at which point<br/>you get a strange orwell variant (becomes a 13-limit extension of<br/>orwell if 65/64 vanishes), or it could also be 13/11, which is a bit<br/>higher in accuracy. Five of these generators gets you to an almost<br/>perfect 9/4, and six gets you to a pretty good 5/2, and seven gets you<br/>to an almost perfect 28/9. It&apos;s 2 AM and I&apos;m way too tired to work out<br/>the commas for now, but that looks like a good temperament.</p><p>(13/8)^(1/4) gets you a slightly sharp major 2nd, which suggests<br/>subdividing the generator further into a slightly sharp fifth; this<br/>means that the pythagorean augmented fifth now becomes 13/8. This<br/>looks like it&apos;d be a pleasant tuning and seems to be supported by<br/>17-equal.</p><p>(13/8)^(1/5) gives you a really interesting choice with a generator<br/>somewhere between porcupine and tetracot; its generator is about 3<br/>cents off from 11/10, which makes for a really neat tuning! 1<br/>generator is an almost perfect 11/10, two generators is about 336<br/>cents, which is 0.08 cents off from 17/14 should you want to get the<br/>17-limit involved, 3 generators is 504 cents, which suggests 81/80<br/>might go well with this; 5 generators is 13/8, and 6 generators is a<br/>decent 9/5, further suggesting that 81/80 vanish. Not bad at all. 5<br/>generators gives you a 672 cent mavila sized fifth, which makes for a<br/>good reason to start exploring there being two different mappings for<br/>3, and having 135b/128 vanish.</p><p>As a random thing I tried to try, (32/13)^(1/4) gives you a 389 cent<br/>major third, which gives a perfect 32/13 after 4 generators, thus<br/>tempering out 8192/8125. It then goes on to give an almost perfect<br/>20/13 after 5 generators, as you&apos;d expect. Might be worth something.</p><p>Thus ends my report, for now.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Mon, Jun 20, 2011 at 9:47 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ve talked a lot about 676/675 lately, which is a <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a> comma.
