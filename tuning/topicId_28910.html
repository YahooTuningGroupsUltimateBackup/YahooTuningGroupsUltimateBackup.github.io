Sometimes they will identify an<br/>equal-tempered chord as &quot;happy, upbeat,&quot; and the same chord in just<br/>intonation as &quot;sad, gloomy.&quot;  Of course, this is the first time they&apos;ve<br/>ever heard anything but equal temperament, and they&apos;re far more<br/>familiar with the first sound than the second.  But I think they<br/>correctly hit on the point that equal temperament chords do have a kind<br/>of active buzz to them, a level of harmonic excitement and intensity.<br/>By contrast, just-intonation chords are much calmer, more passive; you<br/>literally have to slow down to listen to them.  (As Terry Riley says,<br/>Western music is fast because it&apos;s not in tune.)  It makes sense that<br/>American teenagers would identify tranquil, purely consonant harmony as<br/>moody and depressing.  Listening from the other side, I&apos;ve learned to<br/>hear equal temperament music as a kind of aural caffeine, overly busy<br/>and nervous-making.  If you&apos;re used to getting that kind of buzz from<br/>music, you feel the lack of it as a deprivation when it&apos;s not there.<br/>But do we need it?  Most cultures use music for meditation, and ours may<br/>be the only culture that doesn&apos;t.  With our tuning, we can&apos;t.</p><p>My teacher, Ben Johnston, was convinced that our tuning is responsible<br/>for much of our cultural psychology, the fact that we are so geared<br/>toward progress and action and violence and so little attuned to<br/>introspection, contentment, and acquiesence.  Equal temperament could be<br/>described as the musical equivalent to eating a lot of red meat and<br/>processed sugars and watching violent action films.  The music doesn&apos;t<br/>turn your attention inward, it makes you want to go out and work off<br/>your nervous energy on something.</p><p>On a more subtle level, after I&apos;ve been immersed in just intonation for<br/>a couple of weeks, equal temperament music begins to sound insipid,<br/>bland, colorless.  There are only eleven types of intervals available<br/>instead of the potential several dozen that exist in even the simplest<br/>just system, and you don&apos;t get gradations of different sizes of major<br/>third or major sixths the way you do in just tuning.  On a piano in just<br/>intonation, moving from one tonic to another changes the whole interval<br/>makeup of the key, and you get a really specific, visceral feel for<br/>where you are on the pitch map.  That feeling disappears in bland,<br/>all-keys-the-same equal temperament.  As a composer, I enjoy having the<br/>option, if I&apos;m going to use a minor third interval, of being able to<br/>choose among the 7/6, 6/5, 19/16, and 11/9 varieties, each with its own<br/>individual feeling.</p><p>Far beyond the mere theoretical purity, playing in just intonation for<br/>long periods sensitizes me to a myriad colors, and coming back to the<br/>equal tempered world is like seeing everything click back into black<br/>and white.  It&apos;s a disappointing readjustment.  Come to think of it,<br/>maybe you shouldn&apos;t try just intonation - you&apos;ll become unfit to live<br/>in the West, and have to move to India or Bali.</p><p>Does this sound like I have a problem with European music? I don&apos;t at<br/>all.  My beef is with the bland way in which European and American<br/>musics are currently tuned.  In fact, before the 20th century, European<br/>music had its own wonderful non-equal-tempered tunings, which<br/>unfortunately we&apos;ve abandoned.  To read about them, go to my<br/>Introduction to Historical Tunings page.</p><p>&lt;end quote&gt;</p><p>Great words, Kyle!  I&apos;ve got some tongue-in-cheek warnings on my web<br/>page about the dangers of listening to adaptively tuned music.  Where<br/>you speak of colors vs. black and white, the analogy that I use most is<br/>stereo vs. mono.  Either way, there is a depressing compressing of the<br/>sound when returning to 12-tET.</p><p>This seemed like a good time to share these words with the list.

Are<br/>you screaming back in 12-tET? It&apos;s not evil, but I think one of the<br/>great values of music is it&apos;s potential and often realized<br/>contribution (with some musics) to coherence in human mental,<br/>behavorial and even phsyiological functioning.</p><p>The coherence and ordering power of JI is clear to anyone who has<br/>really become involved with practical JI performance on any<br/>significant scale. One is led to realize just how much more music is<br/>than mere entertainment. To view it as little more than entertainment<br/>is to sell a diamond for the price of spinach. Music has a profound<br/>power to mend the spirit and not simply invigorate us with a kind of<br/>go-go-go energy and enthusiasm, or make us empathetically sad or<br/>happy or even to say &quot;oh, how beautiful&quot;. It is much more powerful<br/>than that by far!</p><p>It is almost unthinkable, for example,  to take the JI Indian ragas<br/>on the sitar or sarod and play them in 12-tET. The music would lose a<br/>tremendous amount of its charm, much of which derives from its<br/>tremendous intonational accuracy and coherence and it&apos;s subtle<br/>microtonal flavors. (I don&apos;t like the use of the harmonium in Indian<br/>music for this very reason, unless it is justly retuned to the raga,<br/>which I don&apos;t think is very common.)</p><p>But why arbitrarily assign some kind of JI monopoly to Indian music?<br/>Everything that makes it good for Indian music can also lead us to<br/>myriad polyphonic wonders, and I personally feel this is the future<br/>direction of music in the west. Multi-melodic beauty weaving through<br/>polyphonic structures based on pure, coherent vertical harmonies is<br/>an ideal that is for me well worth aiming for and is the principle<br/>motivation underlying my interest in tuning. It could be a higher,<br/>subtler, more colorful realization of what manifested at an earlier<br/>stage of polyphonic development in the renaissance.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;tuning@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, October 06, 2001 3:21 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] From Kyle Gann&apos;s web page<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The following is from Kyle Gann&apos;s page, at<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/tuning.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/tuning.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;begin quote&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve had interesting experiences playing just-intonation music for<br/>&gt; &gt; non-music-major students.

In fact, before the 20th century,<br/>&gt; European<br/>&gt; &gt; music had its own wonderful non-equal-tempered tunings, which<br/>&gt; &gt; unfortunately we&apos;ve abandoned.  To read about them, go to my<br/>&gt; &gt; Introduction to Historical Tunings page.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;end quote&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Great words, Kyle!  I&apos;ve got some tongue-in-cheek warnings on my<br/>web<br/>&gt; &gt; page about the dangers of listening to adaptively tuned music.<br/>&gt; Where<br/>&gt; &gt; you speak of colors vs. black and white, the analogy that I use<br/>most<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; stereo vs. mono.  Either way, there is a depressing compressing of<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; sound when returning to 12-tET.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This seemed like a good time to share these words with the list.<br/>&gt; Thanks<br/>&gt; &gt; for granting permission!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Kyle also has some interesting clips of his own music on his<br/>&gt; page(s)).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JdL<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

(I answer Dan also below.) No one could<br/>agree more than I. Much as I admire the guts and tenacity and hard<br/>work of pioneers like Partch, I have heard personally little so far<br/>that I consider terribly pleasing aesthetically  or artistically. (Is<br/>there a difference, he asked himself?) For example, Samuel Barber I<br/>consider a towering genius among American composers. I find no one<br/>anywhere near that category in the modern dabblings with JI.</p><p>Although as I&apos;ve just stated in the previous post, I have a strong<br/>personal commitment to JI or JI-approximate tunings such as 72-tET, I<br/>don&apos;t (yet) get my musical kicks there except with the performance of<br/>my own choir when they&apos;re in top form (Cantus Angelicus at<br/><a href="http://www.cangelic.org">http://www.cangelic.org</a>) and a few isolated performances, generally<br/>of early music either in meantone or adaptive JI (e.g., the Hilliard<br/>Ensemble in their album &quot;Lassus&quot; featuring the highly chromatic works<br/>of the young and daring Orlando in deliciously well-tuned a cappella<br/>renditions in adaptive JI).</p><p>To address Dan&apos;s response as well, I do think we&apos;re still missing<br/>each other in that, as you responded, a tuning system is not the<br/>whole story and I&apos;m NOT proposing that it is. But neither should it<br/>be it a damper on creativity. Even if everyone were confined by some<br/>strange and inexplicably immutable cosmic laws of nature to JI<br/>composition, I don&apos;t think that would represent some horrible<br/>travesty for human musical creativity.</p><p>On the other hand, 12-tET has literally confined everyone in almost<br/>just this way over a large chunk of the western world. In spite of<br/>its many wonderful and obvious advantages, I do think that 12-tET and<br/>the almost universal relegation of tuning expertise to professionals<br/>other than the performers themselves, has eliminated for most of<br/>today&apos;s musicians the need to ever confront or even become aware of<br/>the small, microtonal tuning anomalies that were a daily experience<br/>of musicians in earlier times. As a result, the common practice<br/>musical culture in which we musicians find ourselves enveloped<br/>generally has very poorly developed pitch discrimination.</p><p>In amateur circles, especially choirs, the standard piano, often not<br/>even in decent tune in terms 12-tET, is the standard pounded out for<br/>singers learning their parts. Consequently, typical American<br/>choirs, even semi-professional and professional ones, approach 12-tET<br/>tuning from the outside in, meaning they are generally LESS well in<br/>tune than 12-tET. On the contrary, a choir trained in terms of the<br/>first principles of pure harmony that 12-tET compromises (i.e., able<br/>to intuitively recognize pure JI intervals), when constrained to sing<br/>in 12-tET by a piano or organ accompaniment approaches 12-tET from<br/>the inside out, meaning they intuitively compromise a MORE perfect<br/>tuning to optimize consonance with the accompanying instruments.</p><p>I personally find nothing in the potentials intrinsic to JI or its<br/>close approximations that hobbles artistic musical expression unless<br/>you insist that the simple restriction to JI is in itself a block to<br/>it. But if that is our argument, then Shakespeare&apos;s creativity was<br/>hampered because he wrote his works only in English and Goethe&apos;s<br/>because he wrote his only in German.</p><p>If we accept such arguments, then musical creativity becomes too<br/>strictly a function of our freedom to choose a tuning system (our<br/>basic tonal/linguistic vocabulary and even delimiting to a<br/>significant degree the possible melodic/harmonic grammars), and I<br/>personally feel that contradicts our mutually-held thesis (or perhaps<br/>truism) as I understand our positions: namely that artistic merit and<br/>creavity DO NOT reside in the simple choice of a tuning system.</p><p>However, and here we may differ (?), I do feel some systems (JI and<br/>its close approximations) are inherently superior to others for the<br/>reasons already outlined. (After all, there are definitely some<br/>spoken languages that would have substantially restricted either<br/>Shakespeare&apos;s or Goethe&apos;s creativity.)</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Bob and Dan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Tuning and music are not interchangeable terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Son-of-a-bitch, you&apos;ve done it again: distilled it down to what<br/>would<br/>&gt; have been paragraphs of my own babbling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I heartily endorse the possibilities (or fact) that a tuning or<br/>&gt; tunings can be more beneficial, natural, holistic, or ?? than<br/>others,<br/>&gt; and I hold 12tET in fairly low terms on a _tuning_ level.

I&apos;m<br/>personally kind of sick of the old 20th-century aesthetic that seems<br/>to demand revolutionary change and heavy iconoclastic tendencies in<br/>order for anyone to qualify as a major contributor to the arts. It<br/>kind of reaches a point where being revolutionary is all it takes<br/>(e.g., human excrement on toilet paper photographically reversed with<br/>a black white negative).</p><p>I reiterate that there is indeed something deep and beautiful about<br/>justly tuned harmonies that, when applied to great art, such as<br/>DiLasso, Victoria, or Byrd sung a cappella in adaptive JI, elevates<br/>the soul to heights that &quot;experimental&quot; music generally doesn&apos;t even<br/>begin to touch. I like &quot;interesting&quot; in terms of garnering materials<br/>for their compositional possibilities. In terms of final product,<br/>&quot;interesting&quot; is rather sterile, though. I prefer &quot;beautiful&quot;.</p><p>Mozart and Bach were indisputably great composers, but neither<br/>revolutionized basic style. Beethoven was different, but both the<br/>others were content to write conservatively, taking the established<br/>stylistic norms to their highest and most refined expressive values.<br/>Evolution requires overall balance between these apparently opposing<br/>elements to work, otherwise you get degeneration.</p><p>The balance between change versus consolidation and refinement is<br/>cyclical and longer-term, but it must ultimately balance out. I<br/>personally hope what I consider to be the overweening revolutionary<br/>&quot;aesthetic&quot; of the 20th century is balanced in this new century by<br/>some consolidation and refinement.</p><p>I have never read this myself in an authoritative source, but someone<br/>told me Mozart once said, &quot;Music should be beautiful. Otherwise what<br/>good is it?&quot; Whether he said it or not, I wholeheartedly agree with<br/>the idea. In the arts I prefer beautiful things, things that charm<br/>the human psyche, to merely intellectually interesting, challenging,<br/>radical, or &quot;difficult&quot; things. To me, the latter smack of a kind of<br/>academic, sterile elitism that belongs more to a small circle of<br/>mutual back-slappers who deservedly live isolated in their own smug<br/>little world than to the arts.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;You&apos;re so glad . . . because of the irony of it?&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sarcasm, mild petulance?

Jacky Ligon, Mike Leahy, Caetano Veloso, Amy Knoles, Gabriel<br/>Faure, tin hat trio, William Walton, Toru Takemitsu, Antonin Dvorak,<br/>Robert Walker, Moby, Mary Ackerly, Alessandra Beloni, Peter Erskine,<br/>Marc Anthony Turnage.</p><p>Those are the CDs and mp3s that I can see right next to my desk (or<br/>on the play list of Winamp) while I did &apos;catch-up&apos; work in the home<br/>office today. Haven&apos;t listened to Harry in a few days. And not many<br/>microtonalists, until there is better music out there...</p><p>Good to see you back online. I&apos;m still thinking fondly about all my<br/>New York friends, and the Faure I listened to is because my wife is<br/>putting on a concert in two weeks (I&apos;m playing and helping with<br/>logistics) centered around the Faure &quot;Requiem&quot; that will raise money<br/>for the American Red Cross.
