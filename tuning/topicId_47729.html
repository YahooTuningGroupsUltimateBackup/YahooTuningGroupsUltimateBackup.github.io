Guitars and basses usuly can<br/>not play triad chords only the progressions. While a piano can do<br/>triad chords all day long. Currently I am trying out A C E G B D and<br/>D drone A C E G B on my guitars and I love the crushing sound of bar<br/>chords and the harmonies I can estract frome the closer proximity of<br/>semi tones</p></div>
