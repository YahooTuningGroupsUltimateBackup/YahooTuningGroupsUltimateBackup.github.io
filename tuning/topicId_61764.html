The use of &iuml;&iquest;&half;just intonation&iuml;&iquest;&half; or &iuml;&iquest;&half;pure tuning&iuml;&iquest;&half; was paramount to the success of this project.  The magnitude of the overtones and resonance in abundance in this tuning allow the musicians to produce sounds simply not possible with instruments in the 12-tone idiom from the last few centuries.  Both Poole and Bogdanowitsch are long-time practitioners of just intoned music and Mind&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Island is an advanced example of the melodic and harmonic possibilities that can be created using alternative tuning systems.</p><p>All of the recordings on Mind&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Island were created with virtually no prior discussion before the actual taping.  Scale(s) were chosen as a basis for improvisation.  Melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, and duration were spontaneous.  Songs were selected democratically by both parties desiring the inclusion of a particular piece.  Any feeling or uncertainty by either party would lead to the removal of a piece from the CD&iuml;&iquest;&half;s inclusion.</p><p>Justguitar Records was created in the Fall of 2005 as a vehicle for the Los Angeles-based acoustic guitarist Rod Poole to make available new and archival recordings from his sound library.  Mind&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Island is the first release for Justguitar Records.</p><p>Rod Poole began playing the guitar in 1972.  He experimented with various musical idioms and by the mid-80s, his primary interests were acoustic-based free improvisation and finger-picked solo acoustic guitar.  A founding member of the Oxford Improvisors&iuml;&iquest;&half; Cooperative, Poole&iuml;&iquest;&half;s association was between the years 1983-1986.  After moving to the United States in 1989, his studies in just intonation began with the world&iuml;&iquest;&half;s foremost theorist on the subject, Ervin Wilson.  Poole spent the next several years developing his approach to playing the guitar using just intonation theory.   Poole has released a handful of unique and highly praised CDs on the W.I.N., Transparency, and Incus labels &iuml;&iquest;&half; The Dead Adder, December 96, Iasis,and The Acoustic Guitar Trio.  He contributed &iuml;&iquest;&half;Kalaidoscopic Sunday&iuml;&iquest;&half; to the Henry Kaiser-curated guitar compilation, 156 Strings, and &iuml;&iquest;&half;The Fire Left to Come&iuml;&iquest;&half; to the SASSAS two-CD set, Sound, a compilation of Los Angeles-based performances curated by Cindy Bernard.  Poole was also responsible for engineering the recording of all but three of the performances on Sound.  He has performed with Derek Bailey, Mia Masaoka, Joseph Hammer, Kraig Grady, Nels Cline, Donald Miller, Pat Thomas, Tony Bevan, Eugene Chadbourne, and others.</p><p>- more -</p><p>&gt; From reviews of previous Rod Poole releases:</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;...this is spellbinding minimalism, a testament to the acoustic guitar&iuml;&iquest;&half;s vitality and volatility.
