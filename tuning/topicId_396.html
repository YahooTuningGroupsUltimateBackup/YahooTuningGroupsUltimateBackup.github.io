In<br/>12-tet, three of the (unmarked) thirds are major and four are minor, but<br/>all of the thirds in 7-tet are the same. So I briefly experimented with<br/>16-tet notations to find one that represents major thirds as uniformly as<br/>possible, since the major third is the best consonance in 16-tet. This is<br/>what I came up with:</p><p>C Fb Eb C# D E F Gb Ab F# G A Bb Cb A# B C</p><p>Although it&apos;s not a very good notation scheme, all but one of the thirds<br/>are major (which is as good as you can get with anything other than 7-tet<br/>thirds). A better notation system for my needs is this:</p><p>C C# D D# Eb E E# F F# G G# Ab A A# B B# C</p><p>Three of the major thirds are written with sharps; in fact, all of the ones<br/>that are written with sharps in 12-tet except for D-F. And just as in<br/>12-tet, all but one of the fifths (D-Ab) are written without accidentals.<br/>So it&apos;s at least as good for 16-tet as traditional notation is for 12-tet,<br/>in comparison to the 7-tet &quot;ideal&quot;.</p><p>Daniel Wolf&apos;s &quot;neo-pelog&quot; scale is just as good, and it has the interesting<br/>property that the major and minor thirds are the exact opposite of the<br/>traditional major scale.</p><p>I went back to 20-tet to see what I could come up with. This is a scale<br/>that has similar properties to the first 16-tet scale above; all but one of<br/>the thirds without accidentals are &quot;major&quot; (actually closer to 11/9).</p><p>C Cz C# Dh D Eh E Ez F Fz F# Gh G Ah A Az A# Bh B Ch C</p><p>(It also makes a good notation for 10-tet.)</p></div>
