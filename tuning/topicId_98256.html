After<br/>getting some unsatisfactory answers from musicians, he took it upon<br/>himself to research music and tonality. It was finally the<br/>understanding of combination tones that lead him to believe he could<br/>use the same method that lead to the 12 tone equal temperament, to<br/>devise another tuning from a different framework. He understood that<br/>the 12 tone scale was based around the a major triad, the inversion,<br/>and then filling in the gaps. So, he started with a new triad that was<br/>very harmonically pure, but not contained within the normal 12 tone<br/>framework. He made the stunning discovery that a scale of thirteen<br/>almost equal steps within the framework of an octave and a fifth<br/>(which John Pierce later dubbed as a tritave) contained this very pure<br/>triad. He recognized that this tuning shared a duality with the<br/>traditional Western 12 tone tuning, it had harmonic value, and that it<br/>would be a valid compositional tool.<br/>-----</p><p>If I read that correctly, the &quot;very harmonically pure&quot; triad (I<br/>presume that&apos;s the 3:5:7?) came first, and the BP scale came out of<br/>it. But</p><p>(a) was it even the goal of the scale inventors to create a non-octave<br/>scale? and</p><p>(b) was the goal of the scale to create something in which the first<br/>and last notes *sound the same* the way an octave sounds the same?</p><p>If the answer to (a) is &quot;yes&quot;, then how would it be different from,<br/>say, Carlos Beta? If I hear Beta, I don&apos;t expect to hear a perfect<br/>fourth as &quot;equivalent&quot; to some other non-octave pitch. If I play 0<br/>cents, then 498 cents, and then either 996 or 1698 cents, the 1698<br/>will sound equivalent to the 498, and the 996 won&apos;t -- regardless of<br/>how Carlos designed the scale. If we know our ears hear equivalence<br/>between multiples of 1200 cents, but not for multiples of 498 cents or<br/>100 cents or other arbitrary numbers, why would it work for 1902<br/>cents? Why would I even want it to?</p><p>If the answer to (b) is &quot;yes&quot;, that seems pretty nutty to me. It would<br/>be like training people to see blue as green -- even if it&apos;s possible,<br/>what&apos;s the point?</p><p>As Gene said, the BP scale forces you to be xenharmonic, but I don&apos;t<br/>see how making a non-octave scale suddenly makes non-octave intervals<br/>&quot;equivalent&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=98305 href="#98305">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2011 2:45:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From what (little) I know of it, the motivation was more to extend the root<br/>triad beyond the 5-limit - and thus to delete even factors from its ratios -<br/>and expanding the period was a ready way to do this.

Elaine&apos;s also saying that the timbre doesn&apos;t matter<br/>so much, so I guess it&apos;s more a matter of just cognitively adapting to<br/>organize things differently.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98314 href="#98314">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2011 4:37:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As a long-time friend and correspondent of XJ Scott, proprietor of the site <a href="http://nonoctave.com">nonoctave.com</a> and author of the best microtuning software for the Mac OS (&quot;Lil&apos; Miss Scale Oven&quot;), perhaps I can shed some light on non-octave scales and interval equivalence.</p><p>Okay, so we think we hear octaves as &quot;equivalent&quot;, because we&apos;re used to thinking in note-names that treat them as such.  Really, we hear octaves as &quot;distinct but similar&quot;--&quot;that&apos;s the same note, but higher (or lower)&quot;.  One of the important features of the octave in music is that we can use octave-doubling in arrangement to produce timbral/textural &quot;thickening&quot; of parts, because the octave is such a simple interval that, when tuned pure, it allows two notes to fuse very strongly.  This high degree of fusion--a pure octave is almost seamless, really--is what allows us to treat it as &quot;equivalent&quot;.</p><p>The next-simplest ratio after 2/1 is 3/1, and sure enough you can usually harmonize in parallel 3/1&apos;s to achieve a very similar effect as parallel 2/1&apos;s--textural thickening but no sensation of &quot;added information&quot; because the blend is so strong.  With odd-harmonic-only timbres, this works especially well: if the partials of the tonic are 1:3:5:7:9:11:13:15:17:19 (etc.), the partials of a note 3/1 above it will be 3:9:15:21:27:33:39:45:51:57, which is really just like a stretched-out version of the octave relationship for full-harmonic timbres: 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10 and 2:4:6:8:10:12:14:16:18:20.  So while we may not (because of our conditioning) be able to here the tritave equivalence in BP, it should theoretically be possible to hear, because the tritave does retain *most* of the properties that make octave-equivalence work.</p><p>Now, I like BP for xenharmonic purposes, but I think its progenitors actually thought that it should work &quot;just as naturally&quot; as 12-TET (or at least meantone)--i.e., it wasn&apos;t *supposed* to sound xenharmonic and alien and freaky and weird, it was just supposed to sound a bit &quot;different&quot;.  This is emphatically *not* the case, and I&apos;ve got many ideas as to why.</p><p>For starters, if you compare the Just BP &quot;major scale&quot; (&quot;Lambda&quot;) with a Just major scale, something is pretty obvious:</p><p>BP:<br/>1/1 0 cents<br/>25/21 301 cents<br/>9/7 435 cents<br/>7/5 583 cents<br/>5/3 884 cents<br/>9/5  1017 cents<br/>15/7 1319 cents<br/>7/3 1467 cents<br/>25/9 1768 cents<br/>3/1 1902 cents</p><p>Diatonic Major:<br/>1/1 0 cents<br/>9/8 204 cents<br/>5/4 386 cents<br/>4/3 498 cents<br/>3/2 702 cents<br/>5/3 884 cents<br/>15/8 1088 cents<br/>2/1 1200 cents</p><p>In the BP scale, most of the dyadic consonances are much less concordant than the dyadic consonances in the major scale, and the dissonances are more numerous and more discordant.  There are also a lot of consonances to be found in the major scale besides the usual 4:5:6 and 10:12:15, because there is a greater number of consonant triads you can construct with a 2, 3, 5 basis than a 3, 5, 7 basis; that&apos;s basic math, really.  So right off the bat, there&apos;s going to be less consonance in BP than in meantone.</p><p>Scale-wise, there are more &quot;semitones&quot; in BP (Lambda is TssTsTsTs, the major scale is TTsTTTs), and this makes writing melodies more challenging, since there is a greater likelihood of two adjacent notes in the scale being discordant with one another.</p><p>Also, in the diatonic major scale, the two intervals that compose the major triad (5/4 and 6/5) are in the same interval-class, and the major and minor triads are an otonal-utonal pair.  In BP Lambda, the two intervals that form the main 3:5:7 triad are not in the same interval-class: 5/3 is a BP &quot;major fifth&quot; and 7/5 is a BP 4th.  In other words, parallel tonal harmony doesn&apos;t work the way we&apos;d expect it in BP.  Also, this makes it possible to form either an otonal 3:5:7 triad (1/1-5/3-7/3) OR an utonal 1/(3:5:7) (1/1-7/5-7/3) triad on many of the same roots; if you look at the Lambda mode in terms of which degree forms an otonal (o), utonal (u), both (o/u), or neither (n) triad, it looks like this:</p><p>I: o/u<br/>II: u<br/>III: o/u<br/>IV: n<br/>V: o/u<br/>VI: o<br/>VII: o/u<br/>VIII: o<br/>IX: u</p><p>That&apos;s four roots that are tonally ambiguous.  Also note that the utonal BP triad, when examined as consecutive harmonics, is 15:21:35, which is significantly more complex than the otonal triad of 3:5:7 (vs. 4:5:6 and 10:12:15 in &quot;regular&quot; meantone harmony).  So in the harmonic entropy component of discordance, the BP utonal triad is probably going to sound quite a bit more discordant (it would be interesting to see 3HE values for the two pairs of triads for comparison).</p><p>On the other hand, if we don&apos;t treat the utonal triad as the &quot;minor&quot; triad, but rather the one with the &quot;minor&quot; 5th of 75/49, the our minor chord now approximates harmonics 15:23:35, which isn&apos;t much worse than the utonal triad in complexity but is worse in terms of roughness, the ambiguity is gone and we now have minor triads on the II and IX degrees and unambiguous major triads on the others (except the IV), so that might be functionally a bit better...but it will be psychoacoustically worse, I suspect.</p><p>On the third hand, we can look at 5:7:9 as a harmonic basis instead of 3:5:7; it&apos;s less concordant, but perhaps more familiar sounding (since it&apos;s not so wide).  However, it doesn&apos;t improve tonal ambiguity (5 triads are still ambiguous) at all or lead to the two component intervals sharing a class, so again, it&apos;s not going function like meantone here either.</p><p>In summary, while tritave equivalence and a 3:5:7 basic harmonic unit might be viable alternatives to the octave and a 4:5:6 harmonic unit in and of themselves, the diatonic scale and tonal structure that Bohlen and Pierce came up with to support these harmonic bases fails to be analogous to meantone harmony in many important ways, and that&apos;s probably why most music in BP sounds like something that came from deep space.  That&apos;s also why I don&apos;t think it&apos;s &quot;just&quot; our conditioning that keeps us from being able to intelligize BP in ways analogous to meantone music.</p><p>As an aside, I&apos;ve noticed that the few pieces of music that *do* sound fairly intelligible in BP actually seem to ignore the basis of BP and run in other directions with the scale.  For instance, I&apos;ve noticed that Elaine Walker has a tendency to &quot;meantone-ize&quot; BP in her playing, treating 25/21 as 6/5, and making BP &quot;minor&quot; triads that are basically 5:6:15&apos;s, and occasionally using 75/49 as a pseudo-3/2 for root-movement in chord progressions.</p><p>And this concludes my analysis of the Bohlen-Pierce scale.</p><p>-Igliashon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This conversation confuses me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; But what would count in your terms as hearing tritaves as equivalent?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why would one even want to hear tritaves as equivalent?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From Elaine&apos;s site:<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt; It all started in the early 1970s when Heinz Bohlen became curious as<br/>&gt; to why musicians always use the same 12 note per octave tuning. After<br/>&gt; getting some unsatisfactory answers from musicians, he took it upon<br/>&gt; himself to research music and tonality. It was finally the<br/>&gt; understanding of combination tones that lead him to believe he could<br/>&gt; use the same method that lead to the 12 tone equal temperament, to<br/>&gt; devise another tuning from a different framework. He understood that<br/>&gt; the 12 tone scale was based around the a major triad, the inversion,<br/>&gt; and then filling in the gaps. So, he started with a new triad that was<br/>&gt; very harmonically pure, but not contained within the normal 12 tone<br/>&gt; framework. He made the stunning discovery that a scale of thirteen<br/>&gt; almost equal steps within the framework of an octave and a fifth<br/>&gt; (which John Pierce later dubbed as a tritave) contained this very pure<br/>&gt; triad. He recognized that this tuning shared a duality with the<br/>&gt; traditional Western 12 tone tuning, it had harmonic value, and that it<br/>&gt; would be a valid compositional tool.<br/>&gt; -----<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I read that correctly, the &quot;very harmonically pure&quot; triad (I<br/>&gt; presume that&apos;s the 3:5:7?) came first, and the BP scale came out of<br/>&gt; it. But<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (a) was it even the goal of the scale inventors to create a non-octave<br/>&gt; scale? and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (b) was the goal of the scale to create something in which the first<br/>&gt; and last notes *sound the same* the way an octave sounds the same?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the answer to (a) is &quot;yes&quot;, then how would it be different from,<br/>&gt; say, Carlos Beta? If I hear Beta, I don&apos;t expect to hear a perfect<br/>&gt; fourth as &quot;equivalent&quot; to some other non-octave pitch. If I play 0<br/>&gt; cents, then 498 cents, and then either 996 or 1698 cents, the 1698<br/>&gt; will sound equivalent to the 498, and the 996 won&apos;t -- regardless of<br/>&gt; how Carlos designed the scale. If we know our ears hear equivalence<br/>&gt; between multiples of 1200 cents, but not for multiples of 498 cents or<br/>&gt; 100 cents or other arbitrary numbers, why would it work for 1902<br/>&gt; cents? Why would I even want it to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the answer to (b) is &quot;yes&quot;, that seems pretty nutty to me. It would<br/>&gt; be like training people to see blue as green -- even if it&apos;s possible,<br/>&gt; what&apos;s the point?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Gene said, the BP scale forces you to be xenharmonic, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; see how making a non-octave scale suddenly makes non-octave intervals<br/>&gt; &quot;equivalent&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Jake<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=98315 href="#98315">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2011 4:57:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Apr 21, 2011 at 5:00 PM, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (a) was it even the goal of the scale inventors to create a non-octave<br/>&gt; &gt; scale? and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Definitely yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (b) was the goal of the scale to create something in which the first<br/>&gt; &gt; and last notes *sound the same* the way an octave sounds the same?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right - tritave equivalence in place of octave equivalence.</p><p>Back in my salad days I experimented with scales repeating at 3, with the idea that maybe it wouldn&apos;t sound so much like a key change if you repeated a theme 3 higher in such a scale.

All you have to do is treat 3/1 as the<br/>period, have something else as the generator, and pick a temperament<br/>in which 2/1 has really high Graham complexity.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98325 href="#98325">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2011 6:17:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Apr 21, 2011 at 8:40 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course it has been.

Really, we hear octaves as &quot;distinct but similar&quot;--&quot;that&apos;s the same note, but higher (or lower)&quot;.  One of the important features of the octave in music is that we can use octave-doubling in arrangement to produce timbral/textural &quot;thickening&quot; of parts, because the octave is such a simple interval that, when tuned pure, it allows two notes to fuse very strongly.  This high degree of fusion--a pure octave is almost seamless, really--is what allows us to treat it as &quot;equivalent&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The next-simplest ratio after 2/1 is 3/1, and sure enough you can usually harmonize in parallel 3/1&apos;s to achieve a very similar effect as parallel 2/1&apos;s--textural thickening but no sensation of &quot;added information&quot; because the blend is so strong.  With odd-harmonic-only timbres, this works especially well: if the partials of the tonic are 1:3:5:7:9:11:13:15:17:19 (etc.), the partials of a note 3/1 above it will be 3:9:15:21:27:33:39:45:51:57, which is really just like a stretched-out version of the octave relationship for full-harmonic timbres: 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10 and 2:4:6:8:10:12:14:16:18:20.  So while we may not (because of our conditioning) be able to here the tritave equivalence in BP, it should theoretically be possible to hear, because the tritave does retain *most* of the properties that make octave-equivalence work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, I like BP for xenharmonic purposes, but I think its progenitors actually thought that it should work &quot;just as naturally&quot; as 12-TET (or at least meantone)--i.e., it wasn&apos;t *supposed* to sound xenharmonic and alien and freaky and weird, it was just supposed to sound a bit &quot;different&quot;.  This is emphatically *not* the case, and I&apos;ve got many ideas as to why.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For starters, if you compare the Just BP &quot;major scale&quot; (&quot;Lambda&quot;) with a Just major scale, something is pretty obvious:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BP:<br/>&gt; 1/1 0 cents<br/>&gt; 25/21 301 cents<br/>&gt; 9/7 435 cents<br/>&gt; 7/5 583 cents<br/>&gt; 5/3 884 cents<br/>&gt; 9/5  1017 cents<br/>&gt; 15/7 1319 cents<br/>&gt; 7/3 1467 cents<br/>&gt; 25/9 1768 cents<br/>&gt; 3/1 1902 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Diatonic Major:<br/>&gt; 1/1 0 cents<br/>&gt; 9/8 204 cents<br/>&gt; 5/4 386 cents<br/>&gt; 4/3 498 cents<br/>&gt; 3/2 702 cents<br/>&gt; 5/3 884 cents<br/>&gt; 15/8 1088 cents<br/>&gt; 2/1 1200 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the BP scale, most of the dyadic consonances are much less concordant than the dyadic consonances in the major scale, and the dissonances are more numerous and more discordant.  There are also a lot of consonances to be found in the major scale besides the usual 4:5:6 and 10:12:15, because there is a greater number of consonant triads you can construct with a 2, 3, 5 basis than a 3, 5, 7 basis; that&apos;s basic math, really.  So right off the bat, there&apos;s going to be less consonance in BP than in meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scale-wise, there are more &quot;semitones&quot; in BP (Lambda is TssTsTsTs, the major scale is TTsTTTs), and this makes writing melodies more challenging, since there is a greater likelihood of two adjacent notes in the scale being discordant with one another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, in the diatonic major scale, the two intervals that compose the major triad (5/4 and 6/5) are in the same interval-class, and the major and minor triads are an otonal-utonal pair.  In BP Lambda, the two intervals that form the main 3:5:7 triad are not in the same interval-class: 5/3 is a BP &quot;major fifth&quot; and 7/5 is a BP 4th.  In other words, parallel tonal harmony doesn&apos;t work the way we&apos;d expect it in BP.  Also, this makes it possible to form either an otonal 3:5:7 triad (1/1-5/3-7/3) OR an utonal 1/(3:5:7) (1/1-7/5-7/3) triad on many of the same roots; if you look at the Lambda mode in terms of which degree forms an otonal (o), utonal (u), both (o/u), or neither (n) triad, it looks like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I: o/u<br/>&gt; II: u<br/>&gt; III: o/u<br/>&gt; IV: n<br/>&gt; V: o/u<br/>&gt; VI: o<br/>&gt; VII: o/u<br/>&gt; VIII: o<br/>&gt; IX: u<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s four roots that are tonally ambiguous.  Also note that the utonal BP triad, when examined as consecutive harmonics, is 15:21:35, which is significantly more complex than the otonal triad of 3:5:7 (vs. 4:5:6 and 10:12:15 in &quot;regular&quot; meantone harmony).  So in the harmonic entropy component of discordance, the BP utonal triad is probably going to sound quite a bit more discordant (it would be interesting to see 3HE values for the two pairs of triads for comparison).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the other hand, if we don&apos;t treat the utonal triad as the &quot;minor&quot; triad, but rather the one with the &quot;minor&quot; 5th of 75/49, the our minor chord now approximates harmonics 15:23:35, which isn&apos;t much worse than the utonal triad in complexity but is worse in terms of roughness, the ambiguity is gone and we now have minor triads on the II and IX degrees and unambiguous major triads on the others (except the IV), so that might be functionally a bit better...but it will be psychoacoustically worse, I suspect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the third hand, we can look at 5:7:9 as a harmonic basis instead of 3:5:7; it&apos;s less concordant, but perhaps more familiar sounding (since it&apos;s not so wide).  However, it doesn&apos;t improve tonal ambiguity (5 triads are still ambiguous) at all or lead to the two component intervals sharing a class, so again, it&apos;s not going function like meantone here either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In summary, while tritave equivalence and a 3:5:7 basic harmonic unit might be viable alternatives to the octave and a 4:5:6 harmonic unit in and of themselves, the diatonic scale and tonal structure that Bohlen and Pierce came up with to support these harmonic bases fails to be analogous to meantone harmony in many important ways, and that&apos;s probably why most music in BP sounds like something that came from deep space.  That&apos;s also why I don&apos;t think it&apos;s &quot;just&quot; our conditioning that keeps us from being able to intelligize BP in ways analogous to meantone music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As an aside, I&apos;ve noticed that the few pieces of music that *do* sound fairly intelligible in BP actually seem to ignore the basis of BP and run in other directions with the scale.  For instance, I&apos;ve noticed that Elaine Walker has a tendency to &quot;meantone-ize&quot; BP in her playing, treating 25/21 as 6/5, and making BP &quot;minor&quot; triads that are basically 5:6:15&apos;s, and occasionally using 75/49 as a pseudo-3/2 for root-movement in chord progressions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this concludes my analysis of the Bohlen-Pierce scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igliashon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This conversation confuses me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; But what would count in your terms as hearing tritaves as equivalent?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why would one even want to hear tritaves as equivalent?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From Elaine&apos;s site:<br/>&gt; &gt; -----<br/>&gt; &gt; It all started in the early 1970s when Heinz Bohlen became curious as<br/>&gt; &gt; to why musicians always use the same 12 note per octave tuning. After<br/>&gt; &gt; getting some unsatisfactory answers from musicians, he took it upon<br/>&gt; &gt; himself to research music and tonality. It was finally the<br/>&gt; &gt; understanding of combination tones that lead him to believe he could<br/>&gt; &gt; use the same method that lead to the 12 tone equal temperament, to<br/>&gt; &gt; devise another tuning from a different framework. He understood that<br/>&gt; &gt; the 12 tone scale was based around the a major triad, the inversion,<br/>&gt; &gt; and then filling in the gaps. So, he started with a new triad that was<br/>&gt; &gt; very harmonically pure, but not contained within the normal 12 tone<br/>&gt; &gt; framework. He made the stunning discovery that a scale of thirteen<br/>&gt; &gt; almost equal steps within the framework of an octave and a fifth<br/>&gt; &gt; (which John Pierce later dubbed as a tritave) contained this very pure<br/>&gt; &gt; triad. He recognized that this tuning shared a duality with the<br/>&gt; &gt; traditional Western 12 tone tuning, it had harmonic value, and that it<br/>&gt; &gt; would be a valid compositional tool.<br/>&gt; &gt; -----<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I read that correctly, the &quot;very harmonically pure&quot; triad (I<br/>&gt; &gt; presume that&apos;s the 3:5:7?) came first, and the BP scale came out of<br/>&gt; &gt; it. But<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (a) was it even the goal of the scale inventors to create a non-octave<br/>&gt; &gt; scale? and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (b) was the goal of the scale to create something in which the first<br/>&gt; &gt; and last notes *sound the same* the way an octave sounds the same?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If the answer to (a) is &quot;yes&quot;, then how would it be different from,<br/>&gt; &gt; say, Carlos Beta? If I hear Beta, I don&apos;t expect to hear a perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; fourth as &quot;equivalent&quot; to some other non-octave pitch. If I play 0<br/>&gt; &gt; cents, then 498 cents, and then either 996 or 1698 cents, the 1698<br/>&gt; &gt; will sound equivalent to the 498, and the 996 won&apos;t -- regardless of<br/>&gt; &gt; how Carlos designed the scale. If we know our ears hear equivalence<br/>&gt; &gt; between multiples of 1200 cents, but not for multiples of 498 cents or<br/>&gt; &gt; 100 cents or other arbitrary numbers, why would it work for 1902<br/>&gt; &gt; cents? Why would I even want it to?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If the answer to (b) is &quot;yes&quot;, that seems pretty nutty to me.

It sounds like music written entirely<br/>&gt; in the diminished scale, but somewhat more xenharmonic.

Since running across some nice, shiny<br/>piping at the used hardware store, I&apos;m wanting to make something in phi. It<br/>just doesn&apos;t seem right to use one of the &quot;alloyed&quot; rings of the golden<br/>horogram, so I&apos;m thinking it best to use a scale in ring 13, probably made<br/>of 6 or 7 notes (also, there is no ring 6 or 7 in the horogram). Is there a<br/>sort of &quot;standard&quot; scale that might be suggested?</p></div>
