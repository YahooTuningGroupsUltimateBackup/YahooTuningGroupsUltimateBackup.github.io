I read a little ahead on the posts, for once, and I can see<br/>that I need to learn more about this system.  Could someone PLEASE<br/>send me some samples of it??  I will pay BIG money.  Even over $30...</p><p>Also, PLEASE include the &quot;key&quot; to the notation.  If I&apos;m understanding<br/>this all correctly, the 72-tET system includes 12-tET in it!  And it<br/>seems that the &quot;alterations&quot; are really quite a bit more managable<br/>than thinking of 50 cents alterations from a quarter tone.</p><p>I can surely see that you guys have spent some time thinking about<br/>this in detail.  You must forgive me as still a relative &quot;novice.&quot;</p><p>However, until I get the information on the system and learn to<br/>&quot;internalize&quot; it, I will continue to use quartertones with an<br/>&quot;adjustment&quot; of up to 50 cents, like Johnny Reinhard taught me!</p><p>I should also mention, as an explanation of my current, hopefully,<br/>&quot;practical&quot; method... I also use a &quot;dummy track.&quot;  No, don&apos;t laugh. I<br/>mean, I am using a synthesizer track for the performer to &quot;practice&quot;<br/>with.  Then, of course, in performance, that track is subtracted, a<br/>la &quot;music minus one...&quot;</p><p>Hopefully, with that along with the quartertone/plus minus 50, they<br/>will be able to do it.</p><p>HOWEVER, after reading the explanations of the 72-tET, I am beginning<br/>to wonder if perhaps it isn&apos;t even SIMPLER than that, and easier to<br/>do... particularly with the 12-tET subset.</p><p>I think I should learn about this immediately.  I will check out the<br/>72-tET website that Paul Erlich recently posted.</p><p>The important thing will be to get scores and recordings of this<br/>music so I can judge in a practical way for myself.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking, though, that I may want to try it.  Any suggestions<br/>about how I can get the music would be greatly appreciate.</p><p>Could we start with somebody OTHER than Ezra Sims, though. :)</p><p>Nothing personal, just a bias...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well no, it&apos;s consistency is obviously not improved... this however,<br/>&gt; is (in my opinion) to give consistency a potentially misleading,<br/>&gt; overbearing, bogeyman-like status!

However, 12-tET is<br/>&gt; consistent through the 9 odd-limit while 24-tET is consistent<br/>through only the 5 odd-limit!</p><p>OK.  So this is an excellent argument, which Paul Erlich also makes<br/>further along the post line...</p><p>So actually, Dan, perhaps it really is true that &quot;consistency&quot; really<br/>doesn&apos;t mean all that much...</p><p>This is truly, not to pun, &quot;consistent&quot; with your other arguments<br/>about equal scales in general as compared to uneven just scales....<br/>in the overview perhaps the &quot;purity&quot; of the paradigm is not the only<br/>consideration...</p><p>Of course, as is patently obviously, my contention is that virtually<br/>every living &quot;classical&quot; musician can play quarter tones... or, at<br/>least, won&apos;t &quot;go crazy&quot; upon encountering such music (except in a few<br/>extremely conservative quarters... quarter-tones) and this is, of<br/>course,  a powerful positive for this system.</p><p>Besides, I&apos;ve been using quarter-tones in my music for a long time...<br/>and have never even THOUGHT of them as being &quot;xenharmonic,&quot; they are<br/>so tied to the 12-tET &quot;common practice.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Actually, I disagree with you on this point.
