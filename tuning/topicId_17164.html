And you&apos;ve made the case for FM with such<br/>eloquence, that there is little I feel that I can add.  It is obvious<br/>to me that you have gotten into programming FM, as these are indeed<br/>the most interesting attributes of FM synthesis. I feel that because<br/>the factory sets of most FM synths were optimized for use in pop<br/>music, they create a bad impression for those not brave enough to<br/>tackle the FM paradigm.</p><p>I will back you up here. FM is a totally rich sound design palette<br/>for the synthesis/microtonalist. The fact (as you ably mention) is<br/>that one can make timbres that behave in a much more &quot;instrument-<br/>like&quot; manner than subtractive methods.</p><p>One thing that I find of huge importance for good electronic sound,<br/>is to not be totally reliant upon just one synthesis method for the<br/>sounds in your electronic pieces. Using many different kinds of<br/>synths adds variety to compositions, where if you do it all in one<br/>box, then the music tends to have a subtle &quot;sameness&quot; about it.</p><p>FM has always got a bad wrap for being difficult to program - and it<br/>is not for the faint of heart. But the rewarding part of it, is that<br/>you can get sounds that you could never program with a<br/>oscillator/filter synthesis paradigm. In my younger days, I used to<br/>ponder why Yamaha didn&apos;t put resonant filters on FM synths, but after<br/>I learned how to program FM, I see that you really don&apos;t need them,<br/>as you can still create filter-like effects by other means than<br/>subtractive methods.</p><p>Thanks for this insightful and informative post!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that real analog is adventurous -- I have an Oberheim<br/>Xpander that is<br/>&gt; almost as flexible as a modular, sounds fantastic, and is also<br/>retunable to<br/>&gt; almost any equal temperament -- but I can also answer you question<br/>about FM<br/>&gt; synthesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I like about FM synthesis is that you can program patches that<br/>_feel_<br/>&gt; authentic to play.
