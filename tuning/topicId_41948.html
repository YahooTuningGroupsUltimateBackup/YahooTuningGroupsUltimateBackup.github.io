Ever read the book &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;? It claims that Christ survived the cross and had children, and that the lineage of his descendants forms a tremendous threat to the Catholic Church, which keeps their existence well hidden at tremendous cost. Whatever you think of that conspiracy theory, I believe we microtonalists represent the same kind of threat to the academic music etablishment. 1. We&apos;ve got the numbers on our side, plus hundreds of years of history in which 12tet was unused, compared to their two little centuries or less. 2. We can hear intervals and distinctions and beats that they can&apos;t, and it bugs the hell out of them. Of course they swear that no such intervals meaningfully exist. They mistakenly (I believe) fear that, if we&apos;re proved correct, then centuries of great music by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms et al will be invalidated - a fear that I consider completely groundless, but one that they will fight for to the death. Perhaps they only pretend to fear that because it helps their cause - no one wants Beethoven&apos;s music rendered invalid. You&apos;ve watched the Bush Republicans - any truth that threatens them, they &quot;sweep under the rug and lock down there by powerful-sounding theoretical principles.&quot; Thus act all members of privileged elites.</p><p>But I&apos;ve had the interesting experience of lecturing to non-musician academics about tuning. They immediately see the truth of what I&apos;m saying about JI and well temperament, and don&apos;t even see why it should be controversial. They assume that, as soon as this stuff gets out, the walls of prejudice will come tumbling down. It&apos;s a naive assumption, admittedly. But the very force of the resistance we meet suggests that the academic elites KNOW what a threat we represent; otherwise there&apos;d be no reason not to humor us.

As someone who like others started as a vioLa player, i might be quite capable 9well i haven&apos;t played it in a while) to play any tuning i wish. The problem is honestly is<br/>that i really don&apos;t like hearing certain interval on such instruments and i believe this is due to the timbre of the instrument which evolved out of the tuning. i have found other string instruments work best with the tuning i use.<br/> Possibly this relates to phenomenon hinted at by Sethares. The point if i may be extreme to make the case is that these instruments were not designed to play these intervals (except for your more historic ones of course) and to force them to speck in ways forign to them is productive only up to a point.<br/>What makes the great music possible is the instruments to play them on. there would be no beethoveen without the piano to bang out loud on. the task is as alison says and jon &quot;seconds&quot;. BUILD AND OR MODIFY. This is BTW what ALL other cultures have done. It is fine to use electronics but if we really want<br/>to look at the psychology of the situation. people respond way more to permanent objects that machines that can be retuned right or left to anything or nothing. Even playing such objects when you have an instrument in front of you that plays a new tuning and nothing else it has a power beyond what any one<br/>person can bring to it. It is an unyielding force if not a true personality. yes i can play my slendro on my marion but when a percussionist comes over and starts to play my retuned deagan vibraharp, few expression of HORROR have i ever witness. the tuning is there ant it MEANS it and some just can&apos;t<br/>believe oi can do such a thing.
