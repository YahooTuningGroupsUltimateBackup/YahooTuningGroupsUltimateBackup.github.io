I am still trying to get into the spirit of it, and to figure out the<br/>threads of conversation. I do remember that there was someone here, a few<br/>days ago, who asked me what kinds of tunings I like (presumably in my own<br/>music). I should point out that as for microtonal writing, I am still a<br/>&quot;beginner&quot;, having written only three pieces, which included microtones, and<br/>these are quarter tones. One of my pieces, which is for solo bassoon,<br/>written for Johnny Reinhard, one of the participants on this list, does<br/>include sixth-tones. I have yet to discover the experience of writing for<br/>new and complrex tunings. As far as which tunings do I like to listen to - I<br/>should say: all of them, especially if the music results in being good. I am<br/>very interested in the whole idea of just intonation music, as well as some<br/>of the more remote equal temperament tunings - like 19-equal, 31-equal, etc.<br/>I hope that answers the question.</p><p>One observation that I wanted to point out, which I thought was<br/>&quot;interesting&quot;, was that when Joseph Pehrson put my interview with Stanislav<br/>Kreichi and the ANS synthesizer, most of you were more struck with the<br/>historical situation of persecution of electronic music in the Soviet times<br/>(which doesn&apos;t surprise anyone here in Russia, except that we&apos;re glad that<br/>it&apos;s over), and not too many of you paid to much attention to the extremely<br/>interesting idea behind the creation of the ANS synthesizer (microtonal<br/>writing was a strong factor behind its creation), nor the very interesting<br/>way that it&apos;s constructed. I would suggest, for those that are interested,<br/>to read the interview again, paying attention to that, and I am sure that it<br/>would arouse a lot of questions and discusions. In fact, I even suggesed to<br/>Joseph Pehrson to post just the answer to the second question, which has all<br/>of this information (thinking that the whole interview would be too long),<br/>but he was very interested in the whole material, so that&apos;s why he posted<br/>the whole thing. I am sure that some of the means of construction for the<br/>ANS synthesizer could still be used for constructing some present-day<br/>&quot;advanced technique&quot; electronic and computer instruments, despite the fact<br/>that it&apos;s over forty years old.</p><p>Anton Rovner</p></div><h3><a id=20592 href="#20592">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/31/2001 8:41:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Ant&quot; &lt;ant@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20571.html#20571">/tuning/topicId_20571.html#20571</a></p><p>&gt; One observation that I wanted to point out, which I thought was<br/>&gt; &quot;interesting&quot;, was that when Joseph Pehrson put my interview with<br/>Stanislav Kreichi and the ANS synthesizer, most of you were more<br/>struck with the historical situation of persecution of electronic<br/>music in the Soviet times<br/>&gt; (which doesn&apos;t surprise anyone here in Russia, except that we&apos;re<br/>glad that it&apos;s over), and not too many of you paid to much attention<br/>to the extremely interesting idea behind the creation of the ANS<br/>synthesizer (microtonal writing was a strong factor behind its<br/>creation), nor the very interesting way that it&apos;s constructed.

It&apos;s just that personally, I find the theoretical, musical and<br/>technological aspects of the ANS much more interesting - and in fact, the<br/>topic most relevant to this forum - which was why I was surprised that none<br/>really paid attention to it.</p><p>&lt;&lt; Regarding the ANS, from the article I was a bit unclear as to the actual<br/>nature of the physical interface.  Is it several plates of glass, or one<br/>continuing plate, and how long a period of time does the glass plate<br/>encompass?  Additionally, how does one know what pitch one is on.... are<br/>there 72 divisions indicated on the glass before one starts drawing??  What<br/>does one use to draw, a special pen or some such??&gt;&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s all in the interview! It is one plate of glass (actually, it is several<br/>additional plates of glass, which you can change, but only one is put up on<br/>the synthesizer at a time, on which you could draw. The period of time<br/>depends on how fast you turn the wheel - it could be one minute, or it could<br/>be as long as eight or even ten minutes. My two pieces for the ANS<br/>synthesizer take about five minutes, which is the &quot;average&quot; length of most<br/>such pieces. One can identify the pitches by a chart, which is part of the<br/>instrument (representing a &quot;depiction&quot; of a piano keyboard, which identifies<br/>each exact note, which in turn is divided into six segments, similar to the<br/>millimeter indications on a ruler. So it&apos;s all there - except that achieving<br/>exact pitches of more advanced tunings calls for very careful and meticulous<br/>drawing - if you draw a line a millimeter off, then you have swayed away<br/>from the tuning. You draw with a wooden &quot;pencil&quot; (or an object in the shape<br/>of it, without the lead), which scrapes off the mastic. It&apos;s just a real<br/>pity that as of now almost nobody took advantage of the microtonal aspect of<br/>the instrument - most composers were more interested in the sound color. If<br/>any of you, members of the Tuning List, would find your way into Moscow, you<br/>should visit the old building of Moscow University, where the instrument is<br/>located and have a try at it. Of course, someone can always build a replica<br/>of the instrument in another country - possibly a more modernized one.</p><p>&lt;&lt; Also, I wish somebody on the list would refresh my memory as to all  the<br/>advantages of 72-tET.  I know that our traditional 12-tET scale is included<br/>in it, but what are the other advantages in terms of sonorities again??  I<br/>know it is a very flexible scale and very popular in Boston at the moment.&gt;&gt;</p><p>I personally don&apos;t know all of the advantages of the 72-t ET scale. The<br/>instrument&apos;s inventor, Evgeny Murzin, thought that this would be an adequate<br/>scale to fit many different microtonal temperaments, which the composer<br/>would be at liberty to choose from - including just intonation, the<br/>availability of which was one of Murzin&apos;s aims of achieving. Personally, I<br/>think that 72t ET is rather limiting compared to all the microtonal<br/>possibilities, of which we know today - however, presumably, it was quite<br/>advanced for its time.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Anyway, it does seem that the ANS was a VERY EARLY foray into<br/>microtonality even if the interface methods may seem somewhat antiquated<br/>today by todays computer and MIDI standards...&gt;&gt;</p><p>Well, the initial conception of the ANS does go back to 1938 - which is<br/>quite early for electronic - it was only realized in 1958, already after all<br/>the famous pieces by Stockhausen, Pierre Schaeffer et al. Murzin was, in<br/>fact, inspired by Scriabin&apos;s ideas about microtonality. I don&apos;t know how<br/>many people know that Scriabin actually advocated microtonality (as<br/>witnessed by his biographer, Leonid Sabaneyev, who was soon to become a<br/>major music critic and even stronger advocate of microtonality, later on),<br/>since &quot;he felt constrained within the 12 tone equal temperament scale&quot;. It&apos;s<br/>a pity that he (Scriabin) didn&apos;t live long enough to carry out his ideas in<br/>practice - I am sure that he would have done a great job with it, like he<br/>did with his other achievements in the sphere of new harmony.</p></div><h3><a id=20621 href="#20621">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2001 3:08:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20571.html#20594">/tuning/topicId_20571.html#20594</a></p><p>&gt; Joseph!<br/>&gt;     It is quite good in using harmonics up to he 16th<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, I wish somebody on the list would refresh my memory<br/>&gt; &gt; as to all the advantages of 72-tET.</p><p>I was looking for the Consistency Table (by Paul Erlich or Hahn,<br/>I forget which) that was stored at the Mills College FTP site,<br/>and it doesn&apos;t seem to exist any more.

I am getting MOST of the ideas, but some of the<br/>specifics are still a little vague, even though they are mostly in<br/>the article.  This is the reason for the further questioning.</p><p>For example, it seems from the interview that the plate of glass is<br/>in front of one, or several &quot;wheels&quot; that create frequencies when<br/>light is shone upon them through the mastic.

I realize the ideas WERE expressed in the<br/>article, but only in a way that I could get them in a GENERAL sense.<br/>Thanks for the subsequent clear explanation.  Also, although it is<br/>clear in the interview that one scrapes off the mastic to produce a<br/>pitch, it wasn&apos;t clear to me that one uses a wooden pencil, or<br/>something in that shape to do this.</p><p>This may be all my fault in not being able to grasp these ideas from<br/>the writing, but I would rather blame the *translation* for any such<br/>inabilities on my part!</p><p>In any case, regardless of the &quot;blame,&quot; thank you so much again for<br/>the further elaboration!</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s just a real pity that as of now almost nobody took advantage of<br/>&gt;the microtonal aspect of the instrument - most composers were more<br/>&gt;interested in the sound color.
