This site is the first on the web devoted exclusively to this giant of modern music.</p><p>A wealth of facts and resources, the site includes a biography of Joe&apos;s musical career, a detailed discography, a complete list of his composed works, scanned pages from scores, sound samples, and rare photos from many phases of Joe&apos;s career. Also, for the first time, all of Joe&apos;s works are being made available for sale or for rental through the site.</p><p>In addition, &quot;Preliminary Studies in The Virtual Pitch Continuum&quot;, written by Joe Maneri and Scott A. Van Duyne in 1990, is available for purchase from the Boston Microtonal Society. Modeled after some of Arnold Schoenberg&apos;s rigorous modes of study in his &quot;Preliminary Exercises in Counterpoint&quot;, the book leads students in the creation of 12 separate 4-note ascending microtonal melodies. Then, through subsequent lessons, students rearrange that material: adding voices to create harmonies, putting them to rhythm and by the end of the book, writing in 6-part microtonal counterpoint. You can view pages and hear examples from the book at <a href="http://www.joemaneri.com/publ.html">www.joemaneri.com/publ.html</a></p><p>The site will be updated continuously in the months ahead. Check back for new information.<br/>Questions or comments are encouraged.</p><p>Enjoy!<br/>Jacob Garchik<br/>webmaster and creator, <a href="http://www.joemaneri.com">www.joemaneri.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:jacob@joemaneri.com">jacob@joemaneri.com</a></p></div>
