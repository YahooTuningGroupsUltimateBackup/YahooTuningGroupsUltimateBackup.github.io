I&apos;d like to know if<br/>&gt; anyone<br/>&gt; &gt; finds this useful, as i have similar info on other ETs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is very close to the stuff we&apos;re discussing at tuning-math.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Paul, that may be what you&apos;re discussing there, but it is very<br/>cryptic and difficult to understand for a less mathematically<br/>oriented person.i What Mats presented was very clear and to the<br/>point musically rather than theoretically and I hope he doesn&apos;t<br/>run anywhere else with it!</p><p>That said, I couldn&apos;t do the download, so I haven&apos;t given it a<br/>listen.</p><p>I have certainly been exploring MOS and MOS offspring so I&apos;m<br/>interested in this topic.

I&apos;m<br/>concentrating on 31 and 41 because although they have much<br/>of the same resources (perhaps too much) 31 approaches it<br/>them as a meantone and 41 as a quasi-pythagorean tuning.</p><p>In Saturday improvisations I preferred 31, in part because<br/>the 5-(odd)-limit intervals are more palatable to me than the<br/>3-(prime)-limit (more than compensating for the slightly<br/>bruised 3/2 and 4/3). I also preferred the more exagerated<br/>difference in step sizes (higher value of R).</p><p>So, yes Mats I&apos;d be interested in any discoveries you&apos;ve made.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 1:05:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have certainly been exploring MOS and MOS offspring so I&apos;m<br/>&gt; interested in this topic.
