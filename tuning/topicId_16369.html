McLaren, I&apos;ve heard them all<br/>scoffed at for their need to &quot;get a clue&quot; theory wise when it came to<br/>some aspect or the other of tuning issues.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to be an apologist for slovenly theory and whatnot, and<br/>if something &quot;ain&apos;t right&quot; I do like to know, but for me what&apos;s also<br/>important is weather there&apos;s something useful there, some ideas...<br/>some sparks... Some thing that I can use as a springboard for some<br/>ideas of my own. Something that gets the imagination going in a<br/>positive direction.</p><p>I&apos;ve had some personal correspondence with Ubieta, and he operates<br/>completely within the usual twelve-tone equal tempered way of<br/>thinking, and when he brings up the harmonic series (etc.) and any<br/>sort of teleology he must mean it in a purely conjectural manner: &quot;the<br/>truth from the facts inclines us to think so&quot; is what he once wrote<br/>me...</p><p>Anyway, he&apos;s a nice fellow and an accomplished guy (see his bio), and<br/>it&apos;s my opinion that some things inevitably get lost in the language<br/>differences as well as the mindset differences  -- hardcore tuning<br/>enthusiasts v. the usual twelve-tone equal tempered way of looking at<br/>these things. No, there&apos;s not much excuse for errant misinformation.<br/>But I wouldn&apos;t be too quick to give it all the back of my hand<br/>either...</p><p>Besides, that&apos;s a pretty mean &quot;crunchy&quot; chord he&apos;s got there!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
