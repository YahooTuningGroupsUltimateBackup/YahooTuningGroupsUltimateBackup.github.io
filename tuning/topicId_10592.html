There is a big lag time between what he is doing and that which he wants to make<br/>public in the archives. It is his desire to follow some of the implications what he is working<br/>on to present a complete picture. More often than not, he will give the newer things to those<br/>who works he likes in order to get some response on the material. There is much older material<br/>that also needs to go up, some which interest him so little at the moment it is hard to get<br/>him to concede to put it up.<br/>    He grew up in that adobe house in Pacheco, Chihuahua,<br/>Went to BYU and studied music. Worked as a Draftsman for Lear until his retirement about 10<br/>years ago.<br/>But the gov&apos;t and intelligent (?) agencies keep list on all of us, we probably don&apos;t need to<br/>keep list on each other.  I will dispel with those type of &quot;facts&quot; per se.</p><p>   As much as he still goes to Pacheco twice a year, he prefers to live in a city because he<br/>believes that is where the exchange of ideas take place. Yet no TV. Prefers the radio which he<br/>listens to. He finally &quot;accepted&quot; an answering machine. He didn&apos;t have a refrigerator for<br/>months.  He has an ear that is phenomenal. He hears absolutely everything he puts down on<br/>paper. I have watched him meet people for the first time who knew so much less than himself,<br/>and he might ask question after question to find out not so much what they know as much as a<br/>desire to want to find out what musical problem are they seeking to answer.  Much of his work<br/>has been the result of such conversation. He is more inclined to give his material related to<br/>what the other person is interested in than his own recent innovations. His concise logic is<br/>beyond anyone I have ever met. Not inclined to anything &quot;supernatural&quot; or occult, or overly<br/>speculative.</p><p>As his Father had a seed company , it is of no surprise that his other field of interest is<br/>in  cross-breeding of plants for adaptation to better climates, etc. Believes such things are<br/>done in the old fashion way of planting related plants close by, at times to cause<br/>synchronized flowering, all basic native american methods (is opposed to genetic engineering).<br/>Some of the plants he has done extensive work with include<br/>Corn (was spearhead in causing the first marketing of Blue Corn), Quinoa,  &amp; Monarda (mint<br/>family).<br/>I mention this because IMHO his attitudes towards scales and his structures i believe is<br/>analogous to his plants. If one saw a tuning structure as a &quot;species&quot;, the variations by<br/>individuals would be like the variation in a species. It is &quot;species&quot; that he enjoys making.<br/>He has chosen more the line of work of providing the type of musical material he saw lacking<br/>in order to fertilize the musical arts than in creating &quot;compositions.&quot; He felt he could say<br/>more in the long term by &quot;feeding&quot; his fellow artist the type of musical material grounded in<br/>an acoustical basis and/or in &quot;musical archetypes&quot;. He would probably consider the Moments of<br/>Symmetry as an Archetype, a &quot;spontaneous&quot; human artifact not limited cultural borders. Much of<br/>his work he does in Dreams</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; I would like a little more information regarding Erv Wilson&apos;s background<br/>&gt; and life.  He was obviously a person who didn&apos;t like a lot of<br/>&gt; distracting influences -- maybe a kind of modern Thoreau??  I was<br/>&gt; particularly fascinated by the following quote, which accompanies the<br/>&gt; Combination Product Set document we have recently been studying on the<br/>&gt; list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal01.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal01.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Erv Wilson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;A keyboard program that embodies all of the Combination Product Sets on<br/>&gt; the bottom row of figures 3 &amp; 19 was accomplished by September 1974,<br/>&gt; from my adobe house in Pacheco, Chihuahua, and mailed by pony to John<br/>&gt; Chalmers for Xenharmonicon II...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now there&apos;s a man who doesn&apos;t want excessive external influences!<br/>&gt; Forget e-mail...
