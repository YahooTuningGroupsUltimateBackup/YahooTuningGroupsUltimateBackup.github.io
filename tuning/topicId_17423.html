The term is usually simply called the &quot;Mediant&quot;, and comes from<br/>number theory. It importance is that if you have two adjacent fractions in a<br/>&quot;reasonable&quot; series, by which I mean fractions p/q and t/u such that</p><p>        q*t - p*u = 1</p><p>then the mediant, defined as r/s where</p><p>        r/s = (p+t)/(q+u)</p><p>is the simplest fraction between p/q and t/u. Also, the mediant fits right<br/>into the &quot;reasonable&quot; series, since</p><p>        q*r - p*s = (q*(p+t)) - (p*(q+u))<br/>                  = p*q + q*t - p*u - p*q<br/>                  = p*q + 1 - p*q<br/>                  = 1.</p></div>
