There is something typical about this scale because it<br/>uses in the same time the low version of the Ga of 316 cents (ratio 6:5). In<br/>all the other scales, regrouping an almost infinite number of Ragas, the Ga<br/>is defined either as a 5:4 (386 cents) or a 6:5 or a 32:27, but never two of<br/>them appear in the same scale.</p><p>I don&#xFFFD;t have any recording of a Raga using this high third, but here&#xFFFD;s the<br/>list of all 18 in case someone  might want to look for an example.</p><p>1.

The Raga combines a low minor third (lower as 6:5) resolving to Sa<br/>most of the time and another one which sounds very *actif*, full of energy<br/>and therefore should be higher as the 5:4. Raga Jog doesn&apos;t appear on the<br/>list of Ragas provided by Mr. Framjee.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
