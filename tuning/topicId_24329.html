The equivalent spot in<br/>the 15-equal version didn&apos;t have the same problem, so I got the idea that<br/>it must have something to do with the cycle of major thirds, taking<br/>advantage of the vanishing 128/125 of 12-equal and 15-equal. It turns out<br/>that there aren&apos;t any of the usual comma pumps that rely on the 81/80<br/>anywhere, which is why the rest of the 22-equal version seems to work fine.</p><p>The problem, it turns out, is that there&apos;s a chord in the sequence that I<br/>was interpreting as an Eb major in the treble and a G major in the bass.<br/>The sequence is G# minor / &quot;Eb major + G major&quot; / E minor. The G# minor<br/>chord shares a B with the G major chord and a D# with the Eb major chord.<br/>Both the Eb major and G major chords also have a G in common. This only<br/>works because of the equivalence between D# and Eb.</p><p>So I had to reinterpret the harmony to get it to fit 22-equal more<br/>naturally. It turns out that the main seven-note scale used in Galticeran,<br/>B D Eb F Gb A Bb (with various transpositions), only has this one<br/>enharmonic equivalent!</p><p>     D#  A#=Bb   (Is there a name for this scale as a subset of 12-TET?)<br/>   B   F#<br/>     D   A<br/>A#=Bb  F</p><p>This suggested the possibility of trying other tunings that divide the<br/>octave into three equal parts. I tried 21- and 27-equal, and they fit like<br/>a glove. So now I&apos;ve got two new versions (and one slightly altered old<br/>one) on my web page as MIDI files.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2001 5:16:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>stuff about what happens when the music wants 5/4=cuberoot(2) and<br/>the best 5/4 doesn&apos;t do it in the tuning snipped.
