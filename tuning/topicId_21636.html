I&apos;m using a DX7II; 2<br/>DX7wE!; 1 DX7 and 2 Proteus 1 with Dummy keyboards as has been suggested.  It&apos;s working out for<br/>pitch reference.  All of the pitches is a bit daunting.  I&apos;ve just spent the last couple of days<br/>working out usable notes for each of the 72 pitches.</p><p>My latest email to Dave Canright goes as follows:</p><p>Subject:<br/>         pitch mapping<br/>    Date:<br/>         Sun, 22 Apr 2001 10:13:00 -0700<br/>   From:<br/>         Rick Tagawa &lt;<a href="mailto:ricktagawa@earthlink.net">ricktagawa@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>     To:<br/>         Dave &lt;<a href="mailto:dcanright@nps.navy.mil">dcanright@nps.navy.mil</a>&gt;</p><p>Dear Dave,<br/>This pitch mapping of &quot;usable notes in 72&quot; is really the ticket.  As I<br/>study each one of the 72 as I do them I realize a major hurdle is<br/>overcome by figuring out how each transposition affects which notes.<br/>For instance bringing the 1/1 pitch down 1/3 of a semi tone means that<br/>all 67&iuml;&iquest;&half; notes have new names.  So it&apos;s a transposition down to a new<br/>note name and then shifting that note over one column (say from Db to<br/>the C column.)</p><p>Finale is excellent for this exact task.</p><p>Composing at the 72 keyboard can a little daunting trying to keep track<br/>of these transpositions but with these little pitch maps things should<br/>go more smoothly.</p><p>The only other chords I can think of are the equal temperaments.</p><p>In C, as a model, I have the following pitch map of notes derived from<br/>overtones and undertones.</p><p>+17&iuml;&iquest;&half; = C#(15u); F(43o); f#(45u); Ab(5u);B(61o) (small case = error &gt;5&iuml;&iquest;&half;)</p><p>CP = C(1/1); C#(34o);D(9o); D#(38o); e(51u); F(3u); G(3o); ab(51o);<br/>a(54o); Bb(9u); B(34u)</p><p>-17&iuml;&iquest;&half; = D(61u); E(5o); f#(45o); G(43u); B(15o)</p><p>-33&iuml;&iquest;&half; = c(63o); C#(58u); D(29u); d#(52u); e(13u); F(21o); F#(23u);<br/>G(47o); Ab(25o); a(53o); Bb(7o); b(59o)</p><p>-50&iuml;&iquest;&half; = C(31o); C#(33o); D(35o); D#(37o); e(39o); F#(11o); G(11u);<br/>a(39u); Bb(37u); B(35u)</p><p>-67&iuml;&iquest;&half; = C#(63u); d(59u); D#(7u); e(53u); F(41o); F#(47u); G(23o);<br/>Ab(49o); a(13o); Bb(55o); B(29o)</p><p>The way I&apos;ve spelled it, chords like the minor and dominant seventh are<br/>clear.

Ben Johnston did<br/>write a sonata for microtonal piano . . . most of the &quot;octaves&quot; were<br/>not 2/1 . . . so creative subsetting of 72-tET would be one approach<br/>to your keyboard &quot;problem&quot; . . . for example, we could explore 19-<br/>tone subsets of 72-tET, making use of the fact that the 225:224<br/>disappears in 72-tET . . .</p></div><h3><a id=21649 href="#21649">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>4/26/2001 10:32:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 26 April 2001, Rick Tagawa wrote:<br/>&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dear Dave,<br/>&gt; &lt;br&gt;This pitch mapping of &quot;usable notes in 72&quot; is really the ticket.&nbsp;</p><p>I&apos;m having trouble understanding what you mean by usable notes in 72.</p><p>&gt; &lt;p&gt;In C, as a model, I have the following pitch map of notes derived from<br/>&gt; &lt;br&gt;overtones and undertones.<br/>&gt; &lt;p&gt;+17&cent; = C#(15u); F(43o); f#(45u); Ab(5u);B(61o) (small case = error<br/>&gt; &gt;5&cent;)</p><p>Again, I&apos;m not quite seeing what you&apos;re trying to do hear, but I really doubt that appealing to the 43rd overtone is really going to be useful.</p><p>You can map all of 72-tET to a 5-prime-limit lattice;<br/>72-tET uniquely articulates all the 11-limit consonances (11-limit Tonality Diamond);<br/>72-tET is only consistent through the 17-limit (ratios of odd numbers 17 or less).</p><p>So, even though I&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re trying to do, I&apos;m skeptical that 43-limit ratios are going to help you.

It never occured to me to think of a NOTATION SEPARATE<br/>from composing...or one tuning system functioning ONLY AS A NOTATION<br/>for another different one... I just never thought about it.  But,<br/>clearly, a person can set out to compose in a certain way, and<br/>then use a convenient notation to convey it...</p><p>When we started with the Ben Johnston notation there was no question<br/>that the COMPOSING in Just Intonation and the NOTATION were identical<br/>(if, however, flawed.)</p><p>The same for &quot;Monzowolfellholtz.&quot;</p><p>HOWEVER, it is only when we get into 72-tET that there is a<br/>possibility of a notation...

I was ALWAYS AT<br/>FIRST thinking about using 72-tET as a way to approximate JUST<br/>Intonation... even if I had all the pitches available on keyboards, I<br/>was still BASICALLY thinking about using the just intervals that you<br/>outline on the Tagawa webpage chart.</p><p>HOWEVER, would I *really* compose that way with it??  Answer:<br/>probably not... Once I got all the pitches and started &quot;hearing<br/>things&quot; I would probably forget all about the just systems and start<br/>just USING 71-tET in one way or another.</p><p>So, from that standpoint you&apos;re right... I would have &quot;evolved&quot; more<br/>into the system than I had intended originally.

I always tried to grow the<br/>blue patch in the optimum directions (1,3) and (2,2), until I had 19<br/>notes.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=21801 href="#21801">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2001 4:05:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21636.html#21795">/tuning/topicId_21636.html#21795</a></p><p>&gt; I assume the 1/6-tone line was a typo and should be<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sharpen  flatten<br/>&gt;       +  -   1/12-tone (1 step of 72-EDO)<br/>&gt;       &gt;  &lt;   1/6-tone  (2 steps of 72-EDO)<br/>&gt;       ^  v   1/4-tone  (3 steps of 72-EDO)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least that&apos;s how you&apos;ve used them on the lattice, and it<br/>&gt; makes more sense to me that a &quot;greater than&quot; symbol should<br/>&gt; result in sharpening.</p><p>Yup, I reversed the &lt; &gt; signs.

It seems it would have<br/>&gt; been much more applicable in the &quot;computer age...&quot; and now<br/>&gt; it&apos;s kind of late, since you have all these instrumentalists<br/>&gt; in Boston knowing the other symbols... (??)</p><p>This issue hasn&apos;t really been discussed before.  I simply<br/>took the initiative to change the Sims/Maneri notation when<br/>discussing 72-EDO in previous Tuning List posts.</p><p>Actually, I never liked the &quot;square root&quot; sign Sims/Maneri<br/>use for 1/4-tones, or the fact that Sims/Maneri uses arrows<br/>for 1/12-tones, because I had already been using the up<br/>and down arrows to represent 1/4-tones for a few years<br/>and thought that was a great quarter-tone accidental.</p><p>Franz Richter Herf was an Austrian 72-tETer who similarly<br/>used arrows for 1/4-tones, and the same &quot;half arrow&quot; for<br/>1/6-tones that Sims/Maneri use, and Herf used a simple<br/>upward or downward slash for 1/12-tones.</p><p>I thought Herf&apos;s notation was &quot;cleaner&quot;, and it already used<br/>the 1/4-tone notation I liked.  So it was easy for me to adapt<br/>ASCII to that, using the caret and lower-case &quot;v&quot; for the arrows,<br/>&lt; &gt; for the &quot;half arrows&quot;, and + - instead of the slashes.</p><p>(It was interesting to me that &lt; &gt; were the symbols chosen<br/>by Schoenberg to represent quarter-tones, as discussed in<br/>my Microfest presentation.  I&apos;d never seen them used in music<br/>before I put them to use in 72-EDO, and wondered why, because<br/>their use seems so logical.)</p><p>The use of + - actually grew out of my recognition that the<br/>72-EDO 1/12-tone functioned like a syntonic comma in the<br/>lattice, and I was already using + - in ASCII in discussing<br/>Ben Johnston&apos;s notation.</p><p>I agree with you, Joe, that it&apos;s too bad so many Boston<br/>microtonalists are adopting the Sims/Maneri notation instead<br/>of this one.  Same situation as with Johnston/HEWM for JI.<br/>An influential teacher has a school of students who adopt<br/>his notation, and people on this list adopt mine if they<br/>prefer it.  It&apos;s too bad that there&apos;s a divergence.</p><p>Hey, since Maneri is putting out a new version of his book,<br/>maybe he can be convinced to change the notation to this<br/>version before publishing it?  Someone care to pass it along<br/>to him?

(??)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This issue hasn&apos;t really been discussed before.

In general, adaptive JI<br/>will give you more opportunity for consonance than strict JI.</p></div><h3><a id=21840 href="#21840">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/29/2001 4:07:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21636.html#21817">/tuning/topicId_21636.html#21817</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As to your question about propriety, Joseph, I actually think it&apos;s<br/>not too important if a scale is proper or not . . . but a related<br/>property, CS or &quot;constant structures&quot;, may be important.
