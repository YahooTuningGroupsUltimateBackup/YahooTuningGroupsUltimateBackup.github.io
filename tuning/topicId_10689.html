I for one think that the<br/>editing of this list by another or anyone else would be arbitrary. First, there is no one on<br/>this list that is a master of all the material discussed by a long shot. Unless they have used<br/>all this material ( o.k. like material) in musical context, these comments cannot be taken as<br/>anything but speculation.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; I had a looney idea that I bet many of you have thought of, if not<br/>&gt; discussed.

This HAS to have been discussed before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems there are books and books here... there just needs to be some<br/>&gt; &quot;expert&quot; correlation....Erlich, Doty, whomever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this crazy, or been discussed and dismissed?
