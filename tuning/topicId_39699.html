Your experiences with your own players? I just don&apos;t get that sense of &quot;gosh, I&apos;m not going to tackle *that* intonation!&quot; in the people I&apos;ve met at concerts, festivals, etc.</p><p>&gt; Each tuning is a different playing language.</p><p>I thought if one simply read cents, as your groups work, that it wouldn&apos;t be that different. On the other hand, the affect that different tunings has on me, as a listener, would suggest that merely reading cents notation is not the entire story.</p><p>&gt; I could not imagine a SINGLE players of those instruments playing<br/>&gt; more than one tuning on a single concert (unless they can respond<br/>&gt; to cents).</p><p>So if you can read cents, you can play as many intonations as you want, but if you read differing notations (which are simply symbols for cents equivalencies), you can&apos;t. That doesn&apos;t add up, or at the very least underestimates the capabilities of good players.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not trying to stir anything up</p><p>Hey, same here! :) I just don&apos;t want others that might be &apos;listening in&apos; to this thread to get overly pessimistic about what people can and can&apos;t do. And I think there is a big world out there beyond the Big Apple.</p><p>&gt; Do you think I am just a Svengali that can seduce players to play<br/>&gt; for me?</p><p>No, I think you are a very lucky person to be in the situation you are in. Lucky *and* hard-working.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
