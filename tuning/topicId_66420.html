A step by step demonstration would be most helpful.</p><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt; A long time ago I proposed, either here or on tuning-math, a couple of<br/>&gt; temperaments using sine and cosine functions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of them is a classic 12-tone WT centered on re/D using the formula T<br/>&gt; = -sin (pi * n / 12) / 2 * (531441 / 524288), where n is the number of<br/>&gt; fifths away from the central note, integer range -6 to +6, and T is the<br/>&gt; frequency ratio which is multiplied into the note to be tempered (so find<br/>&gt; the base-2 logarithm and multiply by 1200 for pitch value in cents). Also,<br/>&gt; I&apos;m using radians for angles; replace pi with 180&deg; if you&apos;d rather think<br/>&gt; in terms of degrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other is 41-tone, and the formula is T = (1 - cos (pi * n /<br/>&gt; 41)) / 2 * (2^65 / 3^41). This time, the range of n can either<br/>&gt; be 0 to +41, -20 to +20 or even -41 to 0 if you prefer.</p><p>SNIP</p></div>
