(cf. Gardner Read&apos;s<br/>_20th Century Microtonal Notation_...)</p><p>J. Pehrson</p><p>           J. Pehrson</p><p>       Thanks for the book suggestion.  As for the no standards matter... This is why I suggested<br/>   that each note have a octave and cent designation next to it, like 2-0100 for: octave 2<br/>   100 cents up from the &apos;C&apos; note. (As you might realize this HAS to be printed on the page itself<br/>   so someone who has a physical page of sheet music could scan it into a computer.)  If<br/>   something is NOT done these days microtonal musicians 20,40,60 years from now will be<br/>   faced with the same problems that exist today. I hope someone does something sometime.</p><p>   Stephen Szpak</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Tired of slow downloads?
