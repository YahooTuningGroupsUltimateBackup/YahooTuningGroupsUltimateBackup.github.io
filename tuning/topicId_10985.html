Given the distances involved, inviting you<br/>and others over to hear a bit of improvisation might not be so<br/>practical, although this setting might best reflect where I am at the<br/>moment.</p><p>It&apos;s curious: over the last 30 years or so, I&apos;ve developed a fairly<br/>standard stock of improvisational figures or &quot;riffs&quot; in a more or less<br/>14th-century European style, maybe better heard than described in<br/>words. Trying them out, along with some medieval compositions, is one<br/>way I &quot;get acquainted&quot; with a new tuning.</p><p>Sometimes I may find it easy to write about theory or mathematics,<br/>harder to communicate _enthusiasm_ for the music itself which provides<br/>an occasion for the diversions of theory and mathematics. You remarks<br/>lend me encouragement in focusing on the musical experience itself.</p><p>Before replying to an interesting question you raise about 17-tone<br/>equal temperament (17-tet) and Pythagorean, please let also express my<br/>warm regards to Paul Erlich and Graham, who have shared their own<br/>musical experiences and viewpoints here. Thus Paul&apos;s enthusiastic<br/>advocacy of 22-tet, and Graham&apos;s of schismic temperaments, have set an<br/>example for me, and their sometimes divergent views serve as a very<br/>creative irritant to spur me on.</p><p>&gt; One thing that might be interesting to note here is that if 17 is<br/>&gt; set so that the fifth is just -- i.e., ~17.095-tET -- the max error<br/>&gt; at the octave is only ~6.7&#xFFFD;, and if you were to call this margin of<br/>&gt; error something close to naturally occurring tuning errors, it<br/>&gt; should follow that you could also conceivably see 17 as consistent<br/>&gt; all the way through the 15-odd limit (though according to the<br/>&gt; integer consistency measure as I understand it, an actual<br/>&gt; ~17.095-tET would be consistent through seven).</p><p>Here your &quot;17.095-tet&quot; is a neat description of Pythagorean tuning<br/>with pure fifths, and 17-note tunings (Gb-A#) are described and<br/>advocated by the early 15th-century theorists Prosdocimus of<br/>Beldemandis (1413) and Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1430-1440). I use this<br/>tuning, or typically a 15 or 16 note subset, for some keyboard and<br/>other compositions of the era, and such tunings occur in various other<br/>world musics, including the Arabic and Persian traditions.</p><p>However, it is Pythagorean 53 rather than 17 which permits a<br/>&quot;virtually closed&quot; system, with a differenece of only ~3.6 cents<br/>between 53 pure fifths and 18 pure octaves.</p><p>Indeed 17 (16 pure fifths) is what Ervin Wilson calls a &quot;Moment of<br/>Symmetry&quot; (MOS), but adding a 17th fifth breaks the symmetry by giving<br/>rise to a new interval of around 66.76 cents, a Pythagorean comma<br/>smaller than the usual diatonic semitone or limma generated from five<br/>fifths down or fourths up, which I affectionately call the &quot;sublimma.&quot;</p><p>This interval of about 1/3-tone occurs in a Xeno-Gothic tuning<br/>(Pythagorean 24) at a number of places, along with &quot;near-7-limit&quot;<br/>intervals whose resolutions to stable 3-limit concords feature this<br/>&quot;sublimma-nal&quot; melodic semitone.</p><p>In Pythagorean 17, we have a few near-7-limit intervals involving<br/>notes near the ends of the tuning chain: 14 fifths or fourths produce<br/>a ~8:7 or ~7:4; 15 fifths or fourths, a ~12:7 or ~7:6; and 16 fifths<br/>or fourths, as between Gb-A#, a ~9:7 or ~14:9. The reason in<br/>Xeno-Gothic for going to 24 notes (the maximum number on two 12-note<br/>keyboards with usual octaves) is to make these intervals available in<br/>more places, and also to make available some sublimmas for their<br/>optimally efficient resolution.</p><p>Having made these somewhat mathematical points, I would add that<br/>hearing some musical examples would explain what I am talking about<br/>much more effectively than words and numbers alone. If only you were<br/>here, I would play some of these resolutions first and _then_ try to<br/>&quot;explain&quot; them.</p><p>While I&apos;m not sure how one goes about systematically testing or<br/>confirming the &quot;consistency&quot; of a scale, my first blush guess might be<br/>to agree with you that Pythagorean 24 could be consistent to the<br/>7-limit at least. With only 17 notes, the main limitation might be<br/>that only a few near-7-limit intervals are available, and no<br/>sublimma-nal semitones for the ideally efficient resolutions of these<br/>intervals.</p><p>Your mention of Pythagorean 17 or &quot;17.095-tet&quot; and 17-tet leads nicely<br/>into the question of how these tunings might be placed in a larger<br/>context. In another article I hope to post very soon, I would like to<br/>address this issue, proposing a &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; or &quot;reverse meantone&quot;<br/>spectrum in some ways a mirror image of the more familiar historical<br/>European spectrum from Pythagorean to around 1/3-comma meantone. The<br/>neo-Gothic spectrum may be said to range from Pythagorean to about<br/>&quot;-1/3-comma meantone&quot; (22-tet) with fifths increasingly tempered in<br/>the _wide_ direction.</p><p>For now, however, I want mainly to offer my thanks for your post,<br/>which moves me to new efforts in practice as well as theory.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=11009 href="#11009">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2000 7:04:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
