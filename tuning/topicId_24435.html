So long as it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to work as meantone as well.</p><p>No. Not meantone as well. It&apos;s interesting to consider a keyboard tuning<br/>that would be a kind of 31 tone well temperament; miracle in one region,<br/>varying smoothly to meantone in another.</p><p>&gt; Oh, this is still theoretical, then?  72-equal definitely sounds like the<br/>&gt; optimum to me.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m trying to find some good ones by ear.</p><p>But some will be unavailable to you _because_ of your intial choice of open<br/>string tuning.</p><p>&gt; Guitars being guitars, this<br/>&gt; often means some added notes creep in to the 11-limit chord.</p><p>Please explain. You mean because they have 6 strings and you only have 4<br/>fingers. This of course is the design challenge.</p><p>&gt;  But different things are likely to sound good with a more accurate<br/>fretting,</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>&gt; so perhaps you should get one of those together.  Perhaps we&apos;ll need to<br/>&gt; optimise for particular inversions.</p><p>Yeah like we&apos;re not very interested in chords containing 10:11, 11:12,<br/>11:14, 11:16, 11:18, but rather 4:11, 5:11, 6:11, 7:11, 8:11, 9:11</p><p>&gt; Another aim is to keep the strings roughly evenly spread in pitch.  No<br/>&gt; pairs in my tuning should be closer than a neutral third, or further &gt; &gt;<br/>apart than a tritone.</p><p>Do you mean no further apart than a diminished fifth (approx 7:10) 633 cents?</p><p>&gt; I thought of putting it around the major third from the nut.  Exactly<br/>&gt; where depends on whether you prefer 5:4 to 9:7.</p><p>Please explain.</p><p>&gt; This should work with<br/>&gt; different open-string tunings, including some that aren&apos;t miracle based.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The optimum choice for this depends _totally_ on what the open string<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning is. If a bunch of likely-looking open string tunings all had<br/>&gt;&gt; the same optimum rotation, that would be good enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How would you define this optimum rotation?  Surely it&apos;d depend on how you<br/>&gt; wanted the &quot;home key&quot; to relate to the open strings.</p><p>Yes, but I figure the scale on the top string must be considered as the<br/>home key (whatever the rotation), because you can&apos;t choose to play these<br/>notes on another string. All other strings only need to give you the home<br/>key as far down the neck as the pitch of the next string (but it&apos;s better<br/>if they go further).</p><p>By way of example, I understand your current tuning to have intervals<br/>between strings of:</p><p>9:11 3:4  9:11 7:10 9:11<br/> +3   -6   +3   -5   +3   in generators</p><p>Taking the high string to contain the complete home key (&quot;r&quot; for<br/>reference), the strings are:</p><p>r+2  r+5  r-1  r+2  r-3  r</p><p>I think we only need to consider the string with the minimum value, r-3.<br/>The fretting should be such that the point of symmetry on the reference<br/>string is the same pitch class as this open string. i.e. POS is (72 -<br/>3*7)/72 oct = 51/72 oct = 750 cents from the nut.</p><p>If the POS is note 4 (decimal) the 21 notes available on the strings would<br/>be: (Missing home-key notes are shown with &quot;*&quot;)</p><p>r+2 r+5 r-1 r+2 r-3 r</p><p>9   2&lt;  6   9   4   7    nut<br/>9&gt;  2   6&gt;  9&gt;  4&gt;  7&gt;</p><p>0&lt;  3&lt;  7   0&lt;  5   8<br/>0   3   7&gt;  0   5&gt;  8&gt;</p><p>1&lt;  4&lt;  8   1&lt;  6   9<br/>1   4   8&gt;  1   6&gt;  9&gt;<br/>    *<br/>2&lt;  5&lt;  9   2&lt;  7   0&lt;<br/>2   5   9&gt;  2   7&gt;  0<br/>    *<br/>3&lt;  6&lt;  0&lt;  3&lt;  8   1&lt;<br/>3   6   0   3   8&gt;  1<br/>    *<br/>4&lt;  7&lt;  1&lt;  4&lt;  9   2&lt;<br/>4   7   1   4   9&gt;  2<br/>*   *       *<br/>5&lt;  8&lt;  2&lt;  5&lt;  0&lt;  3&lt;<br/>5   8   2   5   0   3<br/>*   *       *<br/>6&lt;  9&lt;  3&lt;  6&lt;  1&lt;  4&lt;<br/>6   9   3   6   1   4   POS<br/>6&gt;  9&gt;  3&gt;  6&gt;  1&gt;  4&gt;<br/>        *       *<br/>7   0&lt;  4   7   2   5<br/>7&gt;  0   4&gt;  7&gt;  2&gt;  5&gt;<br/>                *<br/>8   1&lt;  5   8   3   6<br/>8&gt;  1   5&gt;  8&gt;  3&gt;  6&gt;<br/>                *<br/>9   2&lt;  6   9   4   7   octave<br/>9&gt;  2   6&gt;  9&gt;  4&gt;  7&gt;</p><p>When I set it out like this I see it&apos;s tougher than I thought.</p><p>Notice that we have a &quot;hole&quot; between the 2nd and 3rd strings where we can&apos;t<br/>play 4&gt; or 5&gt; at all.</p><p>&gt; I think all these scales would sound better with 31 equal frets to the<br/>&gt; octave.  A blackjack fretting would work specifically for 11-limit<br/>&gt; miracle-based music, and will also have frets in common with meantone.  If<br/>&gt; you have more than 21 frets, they&apos;ll get in the way, so you may as well<br/>&gt; round up to 31, and then make them equal.</p><p>I think I&apos;ll leave it at 21 then (with approx 7/72 gens).</p><p>&gt; Supplying an external drone would be easier than building it into the<br/>guitar.</p><p>Good point.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
