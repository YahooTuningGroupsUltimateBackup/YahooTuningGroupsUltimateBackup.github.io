(and others which I&apos;ve deleted) and posed the question<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;Which would singers/strings/winds &quot;naturally&quot; tend to,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;and which as a composer or director would you coerce<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;them to tennd to?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;to which John Link replied...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My conjecture is number 2), to which could be added a D at 9/8 to make it<br/>&gt;&gt; even more stable:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;and Paul Ehrlich answered...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I would use (3) if I wanted to be conventional though (1) would have a nice<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; reinforcing the tonic. I think it is helpful (as I was<br/>&gt;&gt; just explaining to Jim Savage) to look at all the intervals within the chord<br/>&gt;&gt; -- looking at just the ratios relative to the root obscures what is<br/>&gt;&gt; happening wih all the other intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Bingo. I plugged them in last night and played with them and the issue<br/>&gt;was that ALL the fifths and major thirds were important, and other things<br/>&gt;(like &quot;Cminor&quot;) less so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The crux of the problem is that there is an augmented triad. B D# G and<br/>&gt;D# is punning Eb. The tuning I ended up preferring was<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1/1  3/2   [*]   15/8   45/32<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;where [*] is 15/16*sqrt(8/5) (which is pretty close to 19/16 and closer<br/>&gt;to 32/27).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I believe that singers would somehow &apos;minimize&apos; the errors across all the<br/>&gt;notes, which starts suggesting a temperment. In fact 12tet has a great<br/>&gt;solution to both &quot;fifths&quot; and &quot;augmented triads&quot;.</p><p>Robert,</p><p>Good work. As a former econometrician, I think that your idea of minimizing<br/>errors is on the right track. I suspect that such an approach could yield<br/>good solutions (i.e., solutions that sound in tune) to a number of tuning<br/>puzzles (e.g., C6,9 as tonic). It does suggest that good tuning is<br/>sometimes tempered, and that the tempering depends upon harmonic context.</p><p>How did you come up with 15/16*sqrt(8/5)? Is that the solution to an<br/>optimization problem that you posed?</p><p>How do you think the chord would tune if a D were added at 9/8, as I<br/>suggested in order to increase stability?</p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p></div><h3><a id=6224 href="#6224">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I think this approach is highly promising.<br/>William Sethares has been kind enough to provide Matlab code to calculate<br/>his roughness function, and I use Matlab for harmonic entropy. I also have<br/>the Matlab optimization toolbox. Someday, I&apos;d like to put all this to work<br/>for some real musical examples. Of course, my ear will always be the final<br/>arbiter and shaper of the procedures I use (as it has been so far).</p></div>
