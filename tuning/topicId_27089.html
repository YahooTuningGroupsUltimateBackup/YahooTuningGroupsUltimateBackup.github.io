I am not<br/>concerned here with how any temperament actually arose historically.<br/>For example, 31-tET is a close xenharmonic approximation of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone. 31-tET clearly has an evolutionary history, but can be<br/>derived mathematically from a periodicity block involving a cycle of<br/>31 pure M3s.</p><p>This comma is greater by far than the syntonic comma, but gets<br/>divided by 31 in equally tempering the error rather than only four,<br/>so the 3rds come out much purer than the fifths. So in this case we<br/>choose the 3rds not simply because of the size of the unison vector,<br/>but by this together with how many 3rds are in the cycle that will<br/>divide it.</p><p>It seems that research could be done (if it hasn&apos;t been already)<br/>using some such approach to investigate various temperaments, both<br/>open (meantone) and closed (31-tET).</p><p>Any comments? Thank you in advance, all contributors!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=27104 href="#27104">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2001 3:29:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Question: SINCE -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) to define a periodicity block in an n-dimensional JI lattice you<br/>&gt; need n unison vectors,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AND IF<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) having defined a periodicity block you wish to close the gap and<br/>&gt; construct a closed cycle temperament based on that block (as the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean comma, a unison vector in one-dimensional JI, is closed<br/>&gt; to construct 12-tET),</p><p>So by &quot;close the gap&quot; you mean to temper out a particular unison<br/>vector, or all of them . . . ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; THEN<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t the unison vectors in each dimension different from each<br/>other?</p><p>I&apos;m confused by this question. Different unison vectors are different<br/>from one another, obviously . . . so what are you asking?</p><p>&gt; THEREFORE<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; how can we close more than one of them, simply letting the others<br/>&gt; fall where they will as a consequence?</p><p>Well, closing all of them leads to an ET, as you seem to understand.<br/>Closing not all of them leads to some other scale . . . For example,<br/>let&apos;s say we&apos;re dealing with the diatonic scale, which is the<br/>periodicity block defined by the two unison vectors 25:24 (the<br/>chromatic semitone) and 81:80 (the syntonic comma). Shrinking 81:80<br/>to nothing, while preserving the size of 25:24, leads to a diatonic<br/>scale in 2/7-comma meantone temperament.</p><p>In fact, a few months ago I posted my Hypothesis, which states that<br/>if you temper out all but one of the unison vectors of a Fokker<br/>periodicity block, you end up with an MOS scale. We&apos;re discussing<br/>this Hypothesis on <a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OR<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is it possible to find common unison vector sizes in the lattice<br/>that<br/>&gt; represent vertices of all n dimensions of the lattice with respect<br/>to<br/>&gt; the origin at 1/1 and use that vector size as the &quot;fulcrum&quot; from<br/>&gt; which to construct a temperament?</p><p>Any unison vector will represent a vertex in the lattice when<br/>reckoned with respect to the origin at 1/1. I don&apos;t know what you<br/>mean by &quot;of all n dimesions&quot; or by &quot;fulcrum&quot;. A temperament can be<br/>constructed by tempering out anywhere from 1 to n unison vectors. If<br/>you temper out n (and do it uniformly), you have an ET. If you temper<br/>out n-1, you have a linear temperament. If you temper out n-2, you<br/>have a planar temperament (Dave Keenan has created some examples of<br/>those).</p><p>I direct any future correspondence on this topic (which I warmly<br/>encourage) to</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>. . . the mathematical nature of this topic is uncomfortable for some<br/>people on this list, and the tuning-math group was created explicitly<br/>to alleviate this discomfort.</p><p>Sounds like you may be inventing some interesting new temperaments in<br/>the future, Bob!</p></div>
