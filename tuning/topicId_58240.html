The program includes works by Just Intonation pioneer Harry Partch (1901-1974), including Barstow (1941) and seven of his Li Po Settings (1933), which feature a replica of Partch&apos;s &quot;Adapted Viola&quot; (a viola with a lengthened neck, played cello fashion) and intoning voice. Also featured are several works by Lou Harrison (1917-2003), including Scenes from Nek Chand (2002) for Just National Steel Guitar, one of Harrison&apos;s last completed works; Quando Cosas Malas caen del Cielo (2002) by minimalist and world music pioneer Terry Riley (b. 1935); the premier of a new work by Just Intonation Network cofounder David Doty (b. 1950), and Schneider&apos;s own Lament (1981) for Pythagorean classical guitar.<br/>--<br/>==========================================================================<br/>David B.
