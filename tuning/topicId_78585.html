For another thing, I&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ve never heard Carrillo, but I HAVE heard H&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ba --  particularly some excerpts from &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;Matka&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; and then some short instrumental pieces whose names I don&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;t know. All of them were written in quartertones. My impression is that making totally new harmonic systems is pretty difficult if the used tuning doesn&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;t reflect the basic acoustical properties of intervals and tones. If 24-EDO is used for something else than approximating tetrachords with neutral thirds or seconds, then I find it quite &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;tough&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; to make the music interesting -- I personally don&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;t like the way H&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ba used 24-EDO at all. Moreover, it makes a bad representation to &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;microtonal music&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; in the Czech regions because, after you say &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;microtonal music&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;, many people answer: &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;Ahhh, that&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;s that H&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ba, oh yeah, but that&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;s just out of tune.&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; I can&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;t pretend I disagree because for me H&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ba&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;s music sounds both out of tune and often terribly dissonant. . This makes it even more difficult to defend other non-12-EDO tunings like different EDOs or other non-equal tunings like just intonation or various linear temperaments (and I have already experienced this while speaking both to my schoolmates and to teachers). Luckily, even in the Czech republic, there are a few musicians interested in playing Baroque music, which makes it a bit easier for them to appreciate the value of historical tunings. I&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ve never stayed in Prague for a long time but I think it&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;s even more difficult to present alternative tunings to people in Prague than to, say, people in Brno (about 200 km away), which is where I live. Anyway, I haven&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;t heard any of H&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ba&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;s &dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;twelfth-tone&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac; pieces. In theory, twelfth-tones (72-EDO) should provide excellent intervallic material but I&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;m not sure if H&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;ba could have realized this and used it accordingly.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=78587 href="#78587">üîó</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2008 6:56:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello there petr, I just tried the yousendit link and everything<br/>appears to be okay there, so I&apos;m not sure what happened...
