Rather than make a<br/>different post for each subject, I will list them below.  Hopefully, we can<br/>all work together to find the truth wherever we may.</p><p>1.  Handel had 14 keys per octave as specified by Bosanquet.  Paul, you have<br/>ascertained that he had 16 keys as referenced by Helmholtz.  Well, after<br/>finally unearthing my copy of &quot;On the Sensations of Tone,&quot; I found no<br/>reference at all to Handel and the number of keys he may or may not have<br/>utilized.  Paul, unless I missed something, please reconsider your position<br/>here.</p><p>2.  Did Julian Carrillo _really_ coin the term &quot;microtonal&quot; or even<br/>&quot;microtones&quot;?  Though we&apos;ve taken it upon tradition that he did, now I am not<br/>so sure.  Besides the different language (Spanish), I am unaware of any<br/>particular reference to these terms.  Does anyone have an exact reference of<br/>Carrillo using these terms (not merely the concepts)?  I have copies of all<br/>of his publications as translated and I don&apos;t recall ever noticing this<br/>before.</p><p>3.  Ives&apos;s take on an extended Pythagorean scale as I have previously<br/>outlined is completely outlined by Helmholtz on page 438.  Helmholtz states<br/>on page 312 that &quot;Hence the tone B# is higher than the Octave of C by the<br/>small interval of 74/73&quot; which is equivalent to 24 cents, essnetially an<br/>eighthtone (as specified by Ives).  Helmholtz is quite clear on page 322 that<br/>&quot;According to our system of notation we may identify C# with Db, but we must<br/>distinguish the C# found from the relation of Fifths, from the C# found from<br/>the relation of Thirds.&quot;  On page 438 Helmholtz writes &quot;The notation of music<br/>was adapted to either Pythagorean or Meantone intonation, in which there was<br/>a Diesis or inteval between a sharp and a flat, not to the equal where the<br/>Diesis disappears and sharp coalesces with flat.&quot;  Ives was on firm ground in<br/>interpreting notation in the way I have suggested, as extended Pythagorean<br/>tuning, since Helmoltz was introduced to Ives by his father early on.</p><p>4.  It appears that Helmholtz never read Kirnberger, a true explainer of just<br/>intonation being the basis of music (1776), especially for J.S. Bach.<br/>Helmholtz missed out on a great resource as have most all scholars, as it now<br/>appears.  Kirnberger was an outstanding microtonalist in theory and practice,<br/>a violinist and keyboardist in Berlin.  An antherm of Kirnberger&apos;s opens<br/>Bosanquet&apos;s book on temperament.  &quot;Greater certainly would be the gain of<br/>song if we really had the enharmonic intervals in our system.  For then<br/>singers would accustom themselves, throm their youth up, to sing correcty the<br/>smallest enharmonic intervals, and the ear of the listener to appreciate<br/>them; and thereby would it be possible, in many cases, to make the expression<br/>of the passions very much stronger.&quot;  Kirnberger&apos;s work is published by Yale<br/>University Press and I hope to report on it further.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=7529 href="#7529">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I spoke with Joel Mandelbaum and we were wondering about<br/>&gt;whether he had seen Ellis when he wrote that Handel had 16 tones, and he said<br/>&gt;yes.  (Mandelbaum attributed Bosanquet only).</p><p>&gt;Interesting that Joel thinks that 1/4 comma was superceded by 1/6th comma by<br/>&gt;the time of Handel and that Handel probably used 1/6th comma or more.</p><p>By &quot;more,&quot; Joel undoubtedly means &quot;more than 1/6th comma,&quot; i.e., as much as 1/4-<br/>comma. Although 1/6-comma was by then superceding 1/4-comma on the Continent,<br/>in England 1/4-comma would remain the norm for some time to come.</p></div><h3><a id=7618 href="#7618">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>1/6/2000 7:34:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Frankly, it has been a long time since the dissertation was written and Joel<br/>couldn&apos;t be sure why he had said 1/6th comma.  Then I looked a bit more and<br/>saw that he had written, &quot;Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the fifths<br/>and thirds grew generally larger as meantone temperament of 1/4-comma was<br/>superseded by 1/6-comma temperament and finally by equal temperament.&quot;</p><p>To me it looks like Joel is saying that the third is getting larger,<br/>chronologically, and that is why Handel might be a likely candidate for 1/6th<br/>comma.  I mentioned that maybe since Handel was from Germany where Telemann<br/>and Silbermann were tied to 1/6th comma.  He was a bit fuzzy on it and<br/>suggested that it might be in Bosanquet that he wrote this, feeling there<br/>must be a reason.  I gave him the page that Paul indicated (et al.)  Joel<br/>feels that Handel could have demanded 1/6th comma for his extended organ,<br/>even if it was personal to him and not au courant.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=7747 href="#7747">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Again,<br/>there is a hard-cover, hefty text on the St. Jacobi church organs, and I do<br/>believe there is involvement of a regular kind with Bux.  Clearly, that text<br/>must be uncovered and explored.</p><p>To questions about whether to trust Handel&apos;s accidentals in modern editions,<br/>well, Barbour misrepresented Kirnberger in his book:  Barbour thought nothing<br/>of changing a C#  to a Db when describing K.&apos;s tuning in his now-unavailable<br/>book.</p><p>According to some internet searches, Thuringians are now considered to be<br/>southern Angles, Angle Germans that went south.  This would make Buxtehude<br/>and Werckmeister closer ethnically.  More important is that they were early<br/>buddies, and both died in 1707.</p><p>Kirnberger, also a Thuringian, studied with JS Bach when the master was 55.<br/>Kirnberger would have had to have been on a different planet to think that<br/>Bach was so staunchly unequal.  It seems that the Thuringians were the<br/>staunchest believers in irregular circular tunings and that outside Germans<br/>either bought in to what they were hearing, or dismissed it as Marpurg did.</p><p>After Werckmeister&apos;s death, there is almost no mention of W., and he is<br/>regularly misrepresented.  (Slonimsky claimed the 1691 &quot;Musical Temperament&quot;<br/>work endorsed ET, the editor of the Telemann documents inserted a foot-note<br/>explaining erroneously that Werckmeister was a promoter of ET, Rasch mis-read<br/>into what Werckmeister said-as earlier mentioned, Helmholtz went by hearsay,<br/>etc.).</p><p>Kirnberger does not mention Werckmeister at all, with only a slight against<br/>Telemann for poor understanding of the harmonc rules.  Interesting that<br/>Reinhard Kaiser was self-taught.</p><p>Even Rita Steblin (&quot;A History of Key Characteristics in the Eighteenth and<br/>Early Nineteenth Centures&quot;) in her seemingly exhaustive work, never mentions<br/>Werckmeister.  She does outline a virtual war between Marpurg and Kirnberger<br/>(&quot;Marpurg versus Kirnberger:  The Tuning Controversy in Germany&quot;).  The &quot;war&quot;<br/>was fought in the French world between Rameau and Rousseau and her chapter<br/>hear reads &quot;Equal Temperament versus Unequal Temperament.&quot;</p><p>There seems to have been some serious fall-out from the Kirnberger/Marpurg<br/>war, involving a supression of information, especially published information<br/>from the area of focus.  It seems to me that Rameau&apos;s reversal to support ET<br/>is the strategy employed to say that Werckmeister likewise reversed himself<br/>to ET.  This would indicated that the master J.S. Bach would have also chosen<br/>ET when all was offered.  The Werckmeister material would challenge these<br/>assumptions and have significantly remained untranslated, unmentioned unless<br/>mispreresented,</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=7823 href="#7823">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>1/15/2000 6:46:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Apparently, Werckmeister was hired at the same time as Buxtehude to a post of<br/>administrative assistant.
