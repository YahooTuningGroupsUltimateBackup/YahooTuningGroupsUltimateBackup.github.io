Only the closest three?  Is their volume<br/>&gt;&gt;determined by their distance?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If they are behind the screen they don&apos;t sound at all. Otherwise<br/>&gt;volume is proportional to distance in front of the screen, and of<br/>&gt;course pan is left/right position. You often get tetrads and<br/>&gt;occasionally get to hear a complete hexany.</p><p>Groovy!  I&apos;ll need to bust out headphones and listen for the pan!</p><p>&gt;The 3D image eventually passes thru every possible 3D projection of<br/>&gt;the 4D object (and of course each eye&apos;s image eventually passes thru<br/>&gt;every possible 2D projection of the 4D object). This is unlike Paul<br/>&gt;Erlich or Robert Walkers models, which choose a single 3D projection<br/>&gt;and rotate that.</p><p>Understood.</p><p>&gt;There are 6 planes of rotation in 4D. There is no point in rotating in<br/>&gt;the viewing plane, but the other 5 rotations are &quot;geared together&quot; in<br/>&gt;a chain, with a reduction ratio of phi (or rather the best IEEE<br/>&gt;floating point approximation of it) at each stage. So it &quot;never<br/>&gt;repeats&quot; and takes as long as possible to &quot;almost repeat&quot;.</p><p>As you did with your earlier, 2-D projection (and as I suspected).</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
