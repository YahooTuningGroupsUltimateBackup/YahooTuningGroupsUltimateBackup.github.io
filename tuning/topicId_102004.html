This is what I had in mind. My aim was to possibly find new temperaments with a little help of the knowledge about these phenomena. For example, if we treat a concord like 1:2:3:4 or 2:3:4:5 as if it were 2:4:6:8 or 4:6:8:10, then we can make a concord which is acoustically &quot;symmetric&quot; by turning it into 3:5:7:9. And if 2:4:6:8 is the origin of Pythagorean intonation and 4:6:8:10 is the origin of 5-limit (or Didymean) intonation, then 3:5:7:9 (or 1:3:5:7) suggests a couple of nice non-octave temperaments, one of them being the equal-tempered version of BP. Similarly, something like 3:6:9:12:15 can be turned into 2:5:8:11:14 or 4:7:10:13:16, the latter of which includes the 4/1 and therefore also makes it possible to play 1:4:7:10:13:16. This &quot;triharmonic&quot; series of tones also suggests a few possible temperaments and the one I like the most of all can be found as &quot;parizek_triharmonic.scl&quot; in Manuel&apos;s archive. As to the 2:5:8:11:14 thing, I haven&apos;t explored it a lot yet.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been considering chords for a while now which don&apos;t have to be JI, &gt; and<br/>&gt; also which don&apos;t have to be separated by a constant frequency difference -<br/>&gt; so something like 1:phi:3phi-2 would be an example - it&apos;s a subset of the<br/>&gt; chain 1:phi:2phi-1:3phi-2. I&apos;ve since termed these chords &quot;metaharmonic,&quot;<br/>&gt; to avoid conflict with the &quot;isoharmonic&quot; term.</p><p>I see.</p><p>&gt; They&apos;re fairly useful for periodicity buzz and proportional beating &gt; chords,</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; although I find the effect is stronger for chords that have smaller dyads<br/>&gt; in general - 8:9:10 generates the effect more than 1:3:5, in other words.</p><p>And in the situations when the periodicity may be better perceivable, the actual frequencies are below our hearing range; try comparing 105:115:125 to 5:15:25.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
