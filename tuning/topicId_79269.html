The basic idea is that<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7-tone diatonic scale can be somewhat rudimentally generalized as<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; maximally even, 7-out-of-12. If you&apos;re not familiar with this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; concept, try checking the work of Clough where the mathematical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; conception is given a very useful music theory application:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximally_even">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximally_even</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Understanding the ideas of Myhill--the so-called Myhill&apos;s<br/>&gt; property--<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; really helps to make the musical application of maximal evenness<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; clear:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myhill%27s_property">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myhill%27s_property</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Going one step further, or rather simplifying and generalizing, i<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would say that both Clough&apos;s conception of maximal evenness and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Myhill&apos;s &quot;Myhill property&quot; reflect something that i&apos;d call<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; palindromic symmetry. And that this property is an extremely<br/>&gt; useful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way to begin traversing non-standard equal temperaments.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Applying these ideas to the ukulele, i took the 13-tone equal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperament as a way to test the idea; especially because this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperament was so often referred to in the music theory<br/>&gt; literature<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as something of an apex of discordance (it&apos;s often been written<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had Schoenberg really wanted to liberate dissonance and manifestly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; bypass tonality, he should have discarded 12-tone equal<br/>&gt; temperament<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and applied his organizational schemes in the direction of 13-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; equal temperament). While this view is obviously seductive on a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; number of levels, i also found it incompatible with my own<br/>&gt; empirical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To try to prove this point, i decided that i would apply all these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas on a simple ,acoustic folk instrument which turned out to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this tenor ukulele. The choice of an 8-tone &quot;pandiatonic&quot; subset<br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not entirely arbitrary. Basically I took the basic idea that the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; standard diatonic scale was built from a circle of 12-TET&apos;s<br/>&gt; nearest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximation to a harmonic fifth, and extrapolated that to 13-TET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; where :<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (LOG(3/2))*(13/LOG(2)) = ~8<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The resulting scale would be represented in scale-steps as a<br/>&gt; 21221212<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; maximally even 8-out-of-13 where 2 is a pandiatonic whole-step at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ~185 cents and 1 is a pandiatonic half-step at ~92 cents. As<br/>&gt; Regards<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Myhill&apos;s property, it gives the following arrangement (in cents):<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 185, 277, 462, 646, 738, 923, 1015, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 92, 277, 462, 554, 738, 831, 1015, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 185, 369, 462, 646, 738, 923, 1108, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 185, 277, 462, 554, 738, 923, 1015, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 92, 277, 369, 554, 738, 831, 1015, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 185, 277, 462, 646, 738, 923, 1108, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 92, 277, 462, 554, 738, 923, 1015, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0, 185, 369, 462, 646, 831, 923, 1108, 1200<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This type of palindromic symmetry necessitates an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; deviation/extrapolation of Myhill&apos;s property where you&apos;d have<br/>&gt; shared<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals of an augmented 3rds and a diminished 4th as well as an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; augmented 6ths and a diminished 7ths.
