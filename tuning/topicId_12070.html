JI systems are infinitely<br/>expandable. The implication of this works in reverse in that one is always aware of the limit<br/>one is using and how we are only able to view one part of the forest at a time. I also find<br/>the idea of Equality as offensive. One has only go into large suburban areas to view housing<br/>projects where all the houses are the equal in size and color. Or view one of the box<br/>skyscrapers where from the outside all the floors are equal. Musically  look what happened<br/>when electronics gave us instruments that produced equal timbres throughout a given range. We<br/>hate it. Now we have to program in what acoustic instruments do naturally. Give me hands that<br/>are hands and feet that are feet. something in the middle will not do. With JI it is always<br/>clear where you are . All ETs run into the problem of being ambiguous, where the same size<br/>interval will end up standing for two different intervals and confusion arises. I am confused<br/>enough. There has got to be better things to base ones art upon that ambiguousness</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; ---<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12064">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12064</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not really hoping, necessarily, that everyone will agree, but<br/>&gt; different people&apos;s experiences will help me find the &quot;compass&quot; that I<br/>&gt; feel I could need...</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2000 12:59:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12070">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12070</a></p><p> I also find<br/>&gt; the idea of Equality as offensive.</p><p>You know, Kraig, I truly believe I am reacting to that on a<br/>subconscious level.
