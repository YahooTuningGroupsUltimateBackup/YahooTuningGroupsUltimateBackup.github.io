Better??</p><p>&gt;Essentially all the perfect fifths (and therefore fourths) of the<br/>tuning are &quot;just&quot; (meaning no beats), with significant tempering of<br/>only one note, the final &quot;A&quot; at the end of the tuning cycle.  This<br/>tuning has some extraordinary features:  just intonation major triads<br/>on C and G and just intonation minor triads on E and B.  It is no<br/>wonder that Lou Harrison is so enamored of this tuning with its<br/>&gt;affinity to just intonation.</p><p>So, if I&apos;m understanding the Kirnberger tuning properly, all the<br/>&quot;pain&quot; of  fitting just fifths within the octave is concentrated in<br/>only one place, with a rather significant tempering of A natural at<br/>the end of the tuning cycle.</p><p>So, in other words, rather than being distributed, the tempering<br/>adjustment is big (1/2 Pythagorean comma), and only in one place...<br/>(??)</p></div><h3><a id=14470 href="#14470">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

And, by putting these fifths on the &quot;near end&quot; of the<br/>circle rather than the far end, one can take advantage of some lovely<br/>schismatic thirds: C-E, G-B, D-F#, E-G, and B-D.</p></div><h3><a id=14487 href="#14487">ðŸ”—</a>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>10/16/2000 3:06:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What is the difference between this and Kirnberger I tuning?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=14489 href="#14489">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The most common Kirnberger tuning by far is<br/>Kirnberger III, which is what you can assume if someone just says<br/>&quot;Kirnberger&quot;.</p><p>In Kirnberger III, each of the fifths C-G, G-D, D-A, and A-E is reduced by<br/>1/4 syntonic comma, making C-E a just major third; E-B is just; the tuning<br/>proceeds flatwards from C in just fourths until Gb is reached. B-Gb is then<br/>only a schisma flat of a just fifth.</p><p>-Pablo</p></div>
