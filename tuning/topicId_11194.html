For me, however, I must type the numbers of the station<br/>directly into the RealPlayer... rather than &quot;clicking on&quot; the link.<br/>THEN, that address can be saved in RealPlayer &quot;favorites...&quot;</p><p>HOWEVER, I was wondering if there was any way that John could indicate<br/>or announce the composers of the pieces... that would add to the<br/>experience, at least for me...</p><p>_________ _____ ___ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
