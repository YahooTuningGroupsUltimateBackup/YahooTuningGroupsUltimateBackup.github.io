But when a list of increasing quantities forms part<br/>of a _text_, mathematicians list an increase _down_ the page because that<br/>is the direction in which text is read. I don&apos;t think that most musicians<br/>have a problem with this either.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=22624 href="#22624">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2001 11:10:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22623.html#22623">/tuning/topicId_22623.html#22623</a></p><p>&gt; Monz and Paul and others,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think this business of listing pitches in decreasing order<br/>&gt; is a pain in the Anomalous Saturated Suspension.</p><p>:)  Good one.</p><p>&gt; This is the opposite of how Scala does it, and makes it<br/>&gt; impossible to copy and paste it to become a Scala file.<br/>&gt; One must tediously edit it to reverse the order.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve known this all along.  I suppose that maybe because<br/>I use Excel a lot more than Scala to do my tuning calculations<br/>I still prefer the pitches listed top-down.</p><p>Maybe Manuel can make an easy adjustment to Scala so that<br/>it can read the list either way?</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
