Like many others in the tuning community, my debt to Erv is real and large.  The lessons at his kitchen table -- given entirely gratis -- were the foundation for explorations in tunings, keyboards, notations, and opened up broad questions about tonal musics that remain the substance of my musical work.  My first lesson with Erv was when I was still in High School; I brought a few scores and several pitch lattices in which I had triangulated the 1-3-5 triads, with majors pointing upwards and minors pointing down. Of course, I considered myself especially clever for doing so, but that did not last long when Erv started drawing _his_ lattices.  Wilson&apos;s house, one of the oldest in LA, filled with paper bags filled with corn and chenopod samples alongside metallophones and refretted guitars was a place in which important work took place in a modest way.</p><p>I consider Erv to be the most productive contributor to tuning theory and practice -- the subject in the quadrivium known as Harmonics -- in the 20th century even though he has never been a member of the music theory establishment and has disseminated his work chiefly through direct instruction rather than conventional publication.  His &quot;writings&quot; are mostly in the form of elegant drawings and diagrams.  Professionally, Wilson is from the last generation of industrial draughtsmen -- pre-CAD -- for whom handwork was so well trained that almost anything imaginable could be drawn by hand with a ruler, compass, and pencil, and Wilson&apos;s graphic imagination comes through in each of his tuning documents.</p><p>Many thanks to Erv!</p><p>Dr. Daniel Wolf<br/>Composer, Frnakfurt</p></div><h3><a id=77989 href="#77989">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2008 10:38:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the words, Daniel.  I would have first met Erv,<br/>in that case, about a month after his 70th.  His house at<br/>that time was just as you describe it.  He must be in close<br/>running with Partch and Fokker for the title of most<br/>influential 20th-century microtonalist.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=77990 href="#77990">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/22/2008 10:55:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just wanted to take a moment to note that Erv Wilson had his<br/>eightieth<br/>&gt; birthday last month, an event that seems to have passed without other<br/>&gt; notice here.</p><p>I&apos;m sure, like many or most others, I had no idea when Erv was born,<br/>or what his current age was/is. But he is one of the rare ones, and a<br/>great source of inspiration to many people. We ought to also thank<br/>Kraig Grady, who - with the cooperation of the good people and offices<br/>of Anaphoria - has managed to archive and publish a lot of Erv&apos;s<br/>writings (and drawings). In a way, it is a shame he isn&apos;t more known.<br/>In another way, I think that is pretty special.</p><p>HB, EW!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=77991 href="#77991">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2008 2:21:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>When i last saw that table it was overflowing with one small little writing area in the middle.
