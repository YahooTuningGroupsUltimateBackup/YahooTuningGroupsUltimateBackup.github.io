Casablanca temperament.</p><p>Fine, if you are sure you really want to promote the 42 tuning.<br/>This is actually not a bad temperament, and if you stick to the 7-limit, far more accurate than using 42 would suggest it is. Check out the 7-limit tunings of this: &lt;135 214 314 379 466|. Everything&apos;s cooking but the 11, which makes &lt;135 214 314 379 467| seem like the right choice. That leads to more complexity though, with wedgie<br/>&lt;&lt;19 14 4 32 -22 -47 -15 -30 26 76||. In 31et, these are still the same, but this one would offically have a generator of 15/11~48/35.</p><p>Anyway, this one is 31&amp;73, not 31&amp;42, so it isn&apos;t casablanca. As a non-fives system, it&apos;s a microtemperament, which might interest somebody. It also supports zeus, the planar temperament tempering out 126/125 and 176/175 (and 441/440), and zeus is pretty cool.</p></div>
