I would do it in about<br/>      three trys, (a) bass and snare, (b) ride cymbal, (c) hihat<br/>      and fills)</p><p>   2) quantize all parts in time by about 50% (the quantize<br/>      function in power tracks pro will randomly quantize to<br/>      within some limit of &apos;dead on&apos;. this eliminates the real<br/>      stinkers without making the whole thing metronomic).</p><p>   3) slide individual parts forward or backwards to &apos;push&apos; or<br/>      &apos;play behind&apos; the beat.</p><p>Making a fairly lousy sounding drum track for a tune took less than<br/>the better part of a day!
