To me they sound better<br/>then the skins I have been using for the last 9 years I have been<br/>drumming.  Some say they are louder and some say they are sharper but<br/>I cant decide. I am wondering if you can listen to a recording of my<br/>band and tell me if the drums sound any different to you.  I am<br/>referring rto the snare and the toms not the bass drum.<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com/onegoodword">http://www.mp3.com/onegoodword</a> is the mp3 site that he 4 songs are<br/>available at but only one was recorded with the new skins and that<br/>was the Song at teh bottom called Walk Away.  Tell me what you think<br/>and if you have any tips or experience adjusting home meade skins<br/>then tell me.</p><p>Jax</p></div><h3><a id=18621 href="#18621">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/12/2001 9:16:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jesus,</p><p>Greetings!</p><p>I want to extend an especially warm welcome to you on your arrival on<br/>the tuning list!</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting for your arrival for quite a while now - I think<br/>round about 2000 years!</p><p>And what a relief to learn that Jesus Jams! Great sounding skins dude!</p><p>I really enjoy Goatskin myself, like that found on my fine 22&quot; and<br/>18&quot; Cooperman Bodhrans. It is especially sweet sounding when I play<br/>along the back line of the skin. Blessings to the fine Goats who now<br/>give me wonderful musical pleasures.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; &lt;chokechain@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey all<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i have made myself some home meade drumskins.
