First, let&apos;s consider music which is meant to be<br/>performed by the composer, or is entirely pre-recorded in some fashion, so<br/>there is no performer as such. In that case, whatever works for the<br/>composer/performer and for the computer or synthesizer is fine with me. Most<br/>of my computer music, when I was writing it, fell into this category, and I<br/>suspect most of what I produce for the next year or so will as well.<br/>Whatever makes it faster and easier for me to go from inspiration to a<br/>finished piece is fair game. Being a mathematician, I tend to prefer<br/>traditional mathematical notation and I use the symbolic math engine Derive<br/>rather heavily for such purposes. BTW, as I&apos;ve noted to one list member, at<br/>$250 for ordinary folk and $89 for students and faculty, Derive is a major<br/>bargain and those of you who do a lot of math in your composition should<br/>look into it, if you haven&apos;t already.</p><p>I should note that my past music was mostly &quot;found music&quot;, specifically the<br/>sounds produced by computers when they were performing real calculations,<br/>modified using audio tape techniques borrowed from musique concrete. This<br/>was in the early 1970s. My current plans are much more ambitious, given that<br/>I have much more powerful tools to work with than a reel-to-reel<br/>quarter-inch tape recorder and a discarded military missile tracking<br/>computer of mainframe proportions. :-)</p><p>However, when you&apos;re writing ensemble music, or music for a performer other<br/>than yourself, I think you owe it to the musicians to at least meet them<br/>half way in their own land. That means *readable* conventional musical<br/>notation wherever possible, and *explicit* and *accurate* instructions for<br/>how to produce the sounds you want in cases where conventional notation<br/>fails. So many pieces are performed exactly once and disappear forever<br/>simply because, however great they may sound, they are difficult or<br/>impossible to play without the composer present.</p><p>In the case of just intonation, at least for scales involving the<br/>conventional note names A - G plus arbitrary flats and sharps, we already<br/>have the conventional notation to describe what notes are to be played at<br/>what time, for what duration and at what volume. The only parameter we wish<br/>to change is the *frequency* associated with these notes. The task of making<br/>this notation work thus falls to the musical instrument maker in the case of<br/>new instruments and to the performer in the case of the human voice and<br/>conventional instruments.</p><p>Once we move into the territory of 19-tone, 43-tone or other scales, though,<br/>there is no common notation, and here, in my opinion, the composer and<br/>musical instrument maker have the obligation to put as much effort into<br/>playability as they put into getting the desired sounds. We are fortunate<br/>indeed to have modern GUI technology, fast computers capable of rendering<br/>arbitrary sounds reproducibly to the nearest 96,000th of a second, signal<br/>processing algorithms of great power and other nifty tools at our disposal.<br/>There really isn&apos;t an excuse for a composer to ignore playability any more,<br/>since there is no need to sacrifice anywhere else to achieve it.<br/>--<br/>M.

The piece in question was actually<br/>composed of more than just &quot;found music&quot;, in that some of the sounds were<br/>captured during the idle loops while tapes were rewinding, and these were<br/>actually deliberately coded to make the musical sounds that they did. Other<br/>sounds in the piece were captured with an AM radio in the vicinity of a card<br/>reader.</p><p>For those of you who are interested in this type of music, it&apos;s a little<br/>more difficult to do these days than it was for a number of reasons. First,<br/>they don&apos;t tie speakers to the high-order bits of registers any more.<br/>Second, computers are so fast these days and emit so little RF compared to<br/>their dinosaur ancestors that it is difficult to get audio frequency signals<br/>from them. The most interesting sound I&apos;ve heard recently from a working<br/>computer was the sounds made by an extremely slow off-board floppy disk<br/>drive attached to an HP-100LX palmtop PC. Sadly, those two machines are no<br/>longer among the living. Perhaps my new Sony Spressa CD-RW is slow enough to<br/>make some interesting music on its own, in addition to capturing the output<br/>of my synthesis efforts. :-)</p><p>--<br/>M.

Wouldn&apos;t they look at you<br/>&gt; &quot;cross-eyed&quot; or at least &quot;cross...??&quot;</p><p>Probably.  As I said yesterday, I&apos;ve been creating my music<br/>entirely on the computer since I developed this notation, so<br/>I really can&apos;t offer any &apos;practical&apos; data myself.</p><p>The entire reason I decided to go with prime-factor is that<br/>it correlates regular staff-notation, with which I would assume<br/>any decent performer is already familiar, with a familiarity<br/>of the lattice relationships of the pitches.</p><p>And - the main impetus for inventing it in the first place - it<br/>specifies the same relationships as ratios, without all the big<br/>numbers that you get when you expand from a simple JI set of<br/>pitches into the complex kinds of rational tunings I like to study<br/>and use.</p><p>So understanding the lattice is almost definitely a prerequisite<br/>for being able to use prime-factor notation with ease; I say<br/>&apos;almost&apos;, because there *are* some folks out there who are<br/>comfortable just reading numbers... not me - I always prefer to<br/>graph the data.</p><p>&gt; Has this all been discussed on the list before??  What are the<br/>&gt; other reactions, and, if it HAS been discussed, what are the<br/>&gt; message post numbers??</p><p>AFAIK, there hasn&apos;t really been any thorough discussion of this<br/>on the List.  Graham Breed stands out in my mind as someone who<br/>uses prime-factor notation all the time; he simply presents<br/>the numbers as they would appear in matrix tables, without the<br/>musical staff-notation.  See his website for numerous examples.</p><p>I certainly didn&apos;t originate the idea - altho I *thought* I did<br/>at the time (around 1993).  From what I can tell, Fokker was the<br/>first music-theorist to really make use of prime-factor notation,<br/>and the idea stems back to Euler.  See my Euler webpage:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a></p><p>To tie together all my ideas about this notation, take a look<br/>at the following definitions from my Dictionary</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/prime.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/prime.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/factor.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/factor.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/finity.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/lattice.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/lattice.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/affect.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/affect.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/period.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/period.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/sonance.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/sonance.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/euler.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/euler.htm</a></p><p>Incidentally, you[ve mentioned Mandelbaum several times the last<br/>few days.
