I mean, sure it is, for<br/>&gt;copyright protection and other legalities in a modern society. And yes,<br/>&gt;the music does get played/composed by &quot;me&quot;; but, I truly feel like ideas<br/>&gt;are given to artists from &quot;somewhere else,&quot; so to speak...I know mine<br/>&gt;are.</p><p>Whether I&apos;m composing, arranging, or performing I like to take the attitude<br/>that the works already exist and are waiting for me to discover them. I<br/>don&apos;t hold that as a belief, but I like to adopt an attitude that would be<br/>appropriate if it were true. Why? Because that way I *listen* in such a way<br/>that the integrity of the piece, not my will, is honored. By adopting such<br/>an approach I believe I do a better job of having my work (composition,<br/>arrangement, and performance) come from what Leonard Berstein called an<br/>&quot;inner place&quot; than I would if I acted as if my will was the important thing<br/>(see my post of 12/7/99 9:44 p.m. for the Berstein quotation).</p><p>&gt;I think of art as a gift, and such a gift should always be shared.<br/>&gt;Once a composition goes out into the physical world, I don&apos;t feel like I<br/>&gt;&quot;own&quot; it. I really don&apos;t know why I feel like this, it seems like a part<br/>&gt;of what I am as a musician.( Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;ve played so much<br/>&gt;blues and jazz, where the emphasis is always on individual<br/>&gt;interpretation of certain basic materials. In fact, you try and AVOID<br/>&gt;sounding like someone else, if possible...to have individual style is<br/>&gt;the thing.)</p><p>At least one other person who has expressed views similar to yours about<br/>interpretation has identified himself as a jazz musician, and I can add<br/>myself to that list. I think that the experience of playing jazz, where<br/>improvisation is so crucial, makes easier the acceptance of the idea of<br/>various interpretations. In this debate I&apos;m curious how correlated are the<br/>views about interpretation and experience playing jazz. I think ALL<br/>musicians woud benefit from playing some jazz or other music that employed<br/>improvisation. Bobby McFerrin says that when everybody in the bass section<br/>can play a Bb blues, then Beethoven will swing. And I don&apos;t think he meant<br/>in a corny, artificial way. On the other hand, I&apos;ve run into a number of<br/>jazz musicians that I thought lacked sufficient discipline to play my<br/>arrangements. For example, instead of just playing his one note in the<br/>final chord, a player might compulsively ornament the note, while each of<br/>the others was playing just the note indicated. I believe that such a<br/>player would benefit from playing in an orchestra or big band that required<br/>playing just what was written.</p><p>(snip)<br/>&gt;Kazuhito Yamashita does solo guitar transcriptions of symphonic works,<br/>&gt;to make them accessible for everybody to experience...</p><p>His solo guitar version of Mussorgsky&apos;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; is amazing!</p><p>John Link</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal quintet,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill Evans, Ennio and<br/>Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl Zindars.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=6792 href="#6792">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/9/1999 9:18:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Robert C Valentine &lt;<a href="mailto:bval@iil.intel.com">bval@iil.intel.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I guess I see &quot;my music&quot; like my children, beyond a certain point<br/>&gt;they are their own thing and will go off and be whatever they&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;whether I like it or not.</p><p>Great analogy.
