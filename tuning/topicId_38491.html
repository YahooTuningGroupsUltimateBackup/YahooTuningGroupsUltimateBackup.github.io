Despite the occasional hostilities and personal<br/>attacks, I am still extremely grateful for the thought that some of you are giving to<br/>the ideas my essay. It is important to me to respond to some of you, but it will<br/>take me a few days to get it all out, because of limited time and internet access, so<br/>I hope you&apos;ll bear with me.</p><p>In response to your message number 38366, here goes:</p><p>&gt;By the way, I always hate it when people portentously (and rather<br/>&gt;pompously) insist on labeling music the true this and that. How is<br/>&gt;that, indeed, any different from the True Believer&apos;s assertionsof Just Intonation??</p><p>&gt;In this carnage, Julia manages to claim that Penderecki, Xenakis,<br/>&gt;Ligeti and Bartok are not using &quot;real, true&quot; microtonality.<br/>&gt;Penderecki, Xenakis and Ligeti because the usage is part of some<br/>&gt;larger structure that does not feature specific intervals, and Bartok<br/>&gt;because the usage is &quot;elaborative.&quot; Now, please, who is the<br/>&gt;judge of all this?? Julia Werntz, I guess. Come on. Penderecki and<br/>&gt;Xenakis use wild non-twelvulated microtonality (who&apos;s ever heard<br/>&gt;of &quot;microtonalism&quot;) and, in particular, Xenakis created this<br/>&gt;music from GLISSANDI, the ULTIMATE microtonal sound!!!! What BS.</p><p>&gt;And, on the other hand, who is really to say that Bartok, who<br/>&gt;emulates FOLK MUSIC in his work is not using microtonality? Come<br/>&gt;on. Folk music is microtonal! It&apos;s not 12-equal, what is it??</p><p>When I used phrases such as &quot;true microtonality&quot; or &quot;genuine microtonality&quot; in<br/>this part of the essay I was not using them to mean &quot;virtuous&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, but to<br/>mean &quot;actual,&quot; and I described why I was making such a distinction. There was no<br/>*value* judgement about the music, or its use of microtones, no carnage, only an<br/>attempt to clarify what a composer is really, &quot;truly&quot; going after. I felt this was<br/>clear, though I admit there isn&apos;t too much soft padding in the language of the essay.</p><p>List members certainly must have their own disagreements over this and other<br/>terms. In the essay I exclude certain music which uses &quot;other&quot; pitches from the<br/>term &quot;microtonality&quot; for reasons which seem semantic, but which do enable a<br/>clearer vision of the underlying premise of the type of microtonality I go on to<br/>describe in detail in Part 2. We who have been raised with 12-note ET have as our<br/>point of reference the ET semitone - &quot;half&quot; of an ET &quot;tone.&quot; &quot;Microtones&quot; (or<br/>&quot;microintervals&quot;) in this context, then, would be intervals smaller than a semitone,<br/>and for clarity&apos;s sake I point out that if a composer is not using these<br/>microintervals in such a way that they can be distintcly heard, and be functional in<br/>the voice-leading, as in some works by Xenakis, then it is something other than<br/>microtonality. (But I never say they shouldn&apos;t be doing it!) I might call the field in<br/>which many of you specialize &quot;tuning.&quot; Which is what many of you call it, and is the<br/>name of your list.</p><p>As for Bartok and folk music: I frequently want to correct people when they say<br/>certain folk music is microtonal. (Though I don&apos;t ususally bother.) Some folk music<br/>uses different pitches, and this is often extremely exciting and inspiring to hear, at<br/>least for me, and some types of folk music also involve a lot of pitch bending,<br/>which is also magical. I just don&apos;t think &quot;microtones&quot; is exactly the right word for it.<br/>(Though I admit sometimes when listening to Greek folk or liturgical music, or<br/>classical Turkish music, with my Greek husband I &apos;ll say &quot;Mmm...Listen to those<br/>micro&apos;s!&quot;)</p><p>That said, independently of the purpose of this particular part of my essay, I&apos;m<br/>really not attatched to this, or any, term, and feel no need to own it. (In fact,<br/>socially, sometimes it&apos;s a drag. How many times have I felt a sense of absurdity<br/>when answering the question, esp. from non-musicians, &quot;And what kind of music do<br/>you write?&quot; with &quot;Um... microtonal...&quot;)</p><p>For the record, I think some of the music of Xenakis, Penderecki and Ligeti is<br/>extremely powerful. I just don&apos;t consider the examples I cite to be microtonality in<br/>the sense I described above. (Nor would they, I think...) And I enjoy a lot of<br/>Bartok&apos;s music as well.</p><p>&gt;The assumption is that any composer trying for just intonation<br/>&gt;effects in his/her music is going to write, by necessity, a kind of<br/>&gt;puerile triadic pabulum. Now, what is that assumption based upon?<br/>&gt;According to Julia, it&apos;s due to the fact that just intonation<br/>&gt;composers would only use a very limited palette, since any larger-<br/>&gt;integer ratios would not be acceptably free from beating for use by<br/>&gt;the initiated. So, in this scenario, where do we place a composer<br/>&gt;like La Monte Young, who uses upper-limit JI? Where do we really<br/>&gt;place Lou Harrison, one of the greatest composers of our time (value<br/>&gt;judgment) with all the multiplicity of approaches he&apos;s shown over<br/>&gt;the years. Where do we place Ben Johnston, with the intricate<br/>&gt;complexity and upper-relations of his splendid and AUDIBLE, AUDIBLE,<br/>&gt;AUDIBLE music with higher-limit partials?? No, this makes absolutely<br/>&gt;no sense whatsoever.</p><p>But I never, ever, wrote or implied that &quot;any composer trying for just intonation<br/>effects in his/her music is going to write, by necessity, a kind of<br/>puerile triadic pabulum.&quot; I wrote &quot;...just intontion, if truly adhered to in order to<br/>maintain the indisputably simple consonant language harmonic language that is the<br/>credo (i.e. using the ratios 2/1, 3/2 and 5/4, and maybe 7/4), also limits the<br/>composer stylistically to a sparse, triadic idiom.&quot; And I outline why I believe why<br/>the practice of &quot;upper limit JI,&quot; as you call it, seems to run against the fundamental<br/>premise which is the raison d&apos;etre of JI, at least as it is most often and most<br/>publicly stated. And I did mention Lou Harrison and Ben Johnston...</p><p>&gt;All these artificial divisions and determinations are really what I<br/>&gt;feel is absolutely the worst part of Julia&apos;s essay. I feel there<br/>&gt;is a need to &quot;create copy&quot; by setting up various &quot;straw<br/>&gt;people&quot; and dumping on them.</p><p>&gt;Why is all this necessary?</p><p>There were two reasons why I wrote Part 1. One practical reason was a perceived<br/>necessity to distinguish between the vastly different types of music which,<br/>confusingly, fall under the same name - microtonality - in order to pave the way<br/>for comprehension of Part 2. Many people have told me this was informative, so I<br/>feel satistfied that I was somewhat successful on this count.</p><p>The other, more personal, reason was a need to defend &quot;all non-just musicians of<br/>the world&quot; (and of course, more relevently, practitioners of non-just microtonality,<br/>as well as 12-note ET) against the arguments which are so publicly and convincingly<br/>made, and which are so popular these days. I consider the &quot;rest of us&quot; to be using<br/>what Margo called &quot;found objects&quot; for our art - objects that have been passed on<br/>to us by our respective traditions,  regardless of whether one has a highly<br/>developed intellectual understanding of these objects (e.g. someone like Milton<br/>Babbitt) or is a musically illiterate but gifted musician. I felt I needed to defend this<br/>practice in general, and to bring to light the broader implications of statements<br/>made by many prominent JI advocates. The fact that not all of you buy these<br/>arguments (e.g. equal temperament being the musical equivalent to consuming<br/>large amounts of red meat and processed foods and watching violent action films,<br/>to paraphrase the published statement of a very well known practitioner), does not<br/>mean that these arguments do not need to be publicly, prominently challenged.<br/>That &quot;straw man&quot; is not of my creation!</p><p>&gt;Regardless, curiously enough, the most interesting thing about<br/>&gt;Julia&apos;s article is her musical examples! Her music really<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t look as &quot;academic&quot; as one might surmise by her<br/>&gt;repeated insistence of the avoidance of any low-integer ratio<br/>&gt;harmonic relationships, by serialism or whatever. Actually, the<br/>&gt;short examples of her work seem rather tonal but in the sense of a<br/>l&gt;inear deviation from a tone. This process is also seen in the work<br/>&gt;of her teacher Joe Maneri and in his music, also illustrated, it also<br/>&gt;seems somewhat &quot;anti academic.&quot; Why is this?? Because to my<br/>&gt;mind, even though Julia is constantly changing 72-tET pitches in this<br/>&gt;music, she still keeps pretty much linearly to her starting place!<br/>&gt;That establishes a tonal center, in the sense of the presence of a<br/>&gt;frequency range of tones, and it&apos;s something for the ear to grasp<br/>&gt;onto!</p><p>These last few sentences are extremely interesting for me to read, though I feel<br/>suddenly self-indulgent engaging with such fascination in your remarks on my own<br/>(and Maneri&apos;s) music... There would be so much to say about this last point. I had<br/>written an entire extra section about this, about &quot;pitch regions&quot; (as opposed to<br/>single pitches) being established by spanning in localized sections a range of, say, a<br/>quarter-tone or third-tone (in a way that somehow vaguely parallels root<br/>movement in diatonic music). But it was too new to me in my own music to write<br/>conherently about it, so I omitted it. Besides, sometimes I do lean on certain<br/>individual pitches, as well.</p><p>I am curious, though: what do you mean by academic? Why do you equate<br/>&quot;anti-academic&quot; with &quot;establishes a tonal center&quot; and &quot;something for the ear to<br/>grasp onto&quot;?</p><p>Of course I&apos;m glad not to have my music called &quot;academic,&quot; since &quot;academic music&quot;<br/>to *me* means music that has been written to prove something, ususally how<br/>smart the composer is. (And, to be unexpectedly candid for a moment, it is most<br/>often *love* that motivates me when I compose. Not to mention that &quot;smart&quot; is<br/>often far from what I feel when I&apos;m composing.) Music written with that kind of<br/>academic intent is easily identifiable and is tedious. But my antennae do go up when<br/>I hear that word, since it is frequently used also to &quot;throw the baby out with the<br/>bath water,&quot; by people who cannot accept the music of, say a Babbitt, or a<br/>Ferneyhough, etc. (As some of you fear I am throwing the more innovative JI<br/>composers out with the bathwater.) I believe that some very beautiful and/or<br/>exciting music has been written in a complex way by very smart people. I like to<br/>feel the gut of the composer in the music, and there are a few musicians whose<br/>guts, whose souls, manifest themselves to a heightened degree via their very busy<br/>minds. (Furthermore, I&apos;ve heard plenty of academic tonal music. I even wrote<br/>some, in my &quot;tonal writing&quot; course at Brandeis.)</p><p>&gt;music that has at least some<br/>&gt;elements of lower-integer ratios is audible resounding music, that<br/>&gt;has a corporal aspect that actually rings in the body and emotions.<br/>&gt;This is the element that is lacking in extended academic serial<br/>&gt;composition, the music that hoards of listeners have rejected time<br/>&gt;and again, and has almost caused if not already caused the death of<br/>&gt;contemporary music among audiences, certainly in this country and to<br/>&gt;a large degree in Europe as well</p><p>Could you be more specific? Actually I&apos;ve heard this type of argument so many<br/>times I don&apos;t usually bother, but here we are, discussing things... Is what&apos;s wrong<br/>with, say, Babbitt (to use agian a familiar example), that you think he doesn&apos;t tune<br/>his thirds and sevenths properly, or that he doesn&apos;t have enough (even 12-note ET)<br/>thirds and fifths in his music? Or if it&apos;s not Babbitt, could you give some examples<br/>of composers (they ought to be quite numerous, for you to feel so strongly about<br/>it), who, through their negligence of (in your ownwords) &quot;lower-integer ratios&quot;<br/>have&quot;almost caused if not already caused the death of contemporary music among<br/>audiences, certainly in this country and to a large degree in Europe as well&quot;? I<br/>know I sound sarcastic, but really, I&apos;m asking this question in all sincerity. (Besides,<br/>you used the word &quot;B.S.&quot; !)</p><p>By the way, do you really think: &quot;she has not been gracious *at all* on this forum.<br/>At the very *beginning* she was dismissive. It was a *preemptive* strike by<br/>somebody who obviously doesn&apos;t want any criticism.&quot;? Do I have to pretend to<br/>back down on certain points here and there in order to prove I can accept<br/>criticism?</p><p>-Julia</p></div><h3><a id=38494 href="#38494">ðŸ”—</a>jdstarrett &#x3C;jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2002 12:01:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Joe and list members.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Julia</p><p>Hi Julia.

As it stands, it *includes*<br/>the usage of Bartok and Xenakis and many others.  Maybe you need<br/>another term:  &quot;Werntz-fully-implemented&quot; microtonality or some<br/>such.  I&apos;m not entirely joking!</p><p>&gt; We who have been raised with 12-note ET have as our<br/>&gt; point of reference the ET semitone - &quot;half&quot; of an<br/>ET &quot;tone.&quot; &quot;Microtones&quot; (or &quot;microintervals&quot;) in this context, then,<br/>would be intervals smaller than a semitone,</p><p>***Well, Julia, this list has a *big* history of discussing this<br/>*little* point about the *little.*  I don&apos;t want to get into it right<br/>now (whew!) but there is no unanimous consensus about this point...</p><p>&gt; and for clarity&apos;s sake I point out that if a composer is not using<br/>these microintervals in such a way that they can be distintcly heard,<br/>and be functional in the voice-leading, as in some works by Xenakis,<br/>then it is something other than microtonality.

As I wrote<br/>earlier, I don&apos;t usually bother correcting people when, say, they mention the<br/>&quot;microtones&quot; in certain non-Western and folk music. I *myself* most often use the<br/>term in its general, broad and inclusive sense. As I wrote, I was only trying to get<br/>very specific in that essay about the practice of composing with distinct<br/>microintervals, as microintervals, and to point out the enormous artistic potential<br/>of this simple act. (Which, by the way, is far from being a &quot;Werntz&quot; specialty. I&apos;d<br/>have to be insane to use a term like &quot;Werntz-implemented.&quot; What about Carrillo,<br/>Haba, Wyshnegradsky, Maneri, Eaton, Alain Bancquart, and others? )</p><p> I<br/>&gt; think you will &quot;get more flies with sugar&quot; as they say.  More people<br/>&gt; would be &quot;won over&quot; to your viewpoint if you simply present it rather<br/>&gt; than *contrasting* it with the JI practicioners...  I really believe<br/>&gt; this.  It&apos;s part of what Paul E. calls &quot;accentuating the positive&quot;<br/>&gt; and I believe he&apos;s right there...</p><p>In my mind, my arguments regarding JI are a defensive, rather than offensive,<br/>strike. Although many pure tuning practitioners are simply minding their own<br/>busisness, others are quite polemical and quite influential with their polemics, and it<br/>is the proclammations of such people, not even their music so much, that I was<br/>responding to. (As you may have noticed, I didn&apos;t get into criticisms of specific JI<br/>music itself in the paper. Like you, I have no interest in &quot;naming names,&quot; when it<br/>comes to the music. That really is &quot;bad karma,&quot; as far as I&apos;m concerned, and in<br/>retrospect I&apos;m glad you didn&apos;t answer that other question of mine about specific<br/>composers, especially publicly.)</p><p>Certainly my paper would have been more popular if I had stuck to the points in<br/>Part 2. And as I&apos;ve said before, I never expected Part 1 to be popular *at all* with<br/>musicians who believe strongly in just intonation and similar theories. Well, now<br/>I&apos;ve said what I had to say apropos of the pure tuning movement. If I ever get into<br/>more scholarly papers in the future I will stick to what is really the most interesting<br/>part: how a composer puts together his/her music.</p><p>&gt; I think, as you define it below, we mean more &quot;theoretical&quot;<br/>&gt; music designed more to demonstrate a point than for *listening...*<br/>&gt;</p><p>Do you think that maybe the music of *some* practitioners of just intonation and<br/>other pure tuning methods also falls within this definition of academic music, then?</p><p>-Julia</p></div><h3><a id=38524 href="#38524">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2002 5:29:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38491.html#38522">/tuning/topicId_38491.html#38522</a></p><p>Hi Julia!</p><p>If I ever get into<br/>&gt; more scholarly papers in the future I will stick to what is really<br/>the most interesting<br/>&gt; part: how a composer puts together his/her music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****ALLLLLRIGGGHHHTTTTT!</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think, as you define it below, we mean more &quot;theoretical&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; music designed more to demonstrate a point than for *listening...*<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you think that maybe the music of *some* practitioners of just<br/>intonation and<br/>&gt; other pure tuning methods also falls within this definition of<br/>academic music, then?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Yes, I think it&apos;s possible.

It&apos;s me. :-)</p><p>Julia, you might like to see (and hear)<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/StereoDekany.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/StereoDekany.htm</a></p><p>This was originally _intended_ only as a &quot;scientific demonstration&quot;<br/>but others (including several with no JI agenda to push) then told me<br/>it was in fact music. Actually one person said it was definitely &quot;dope<br/>smoking&quot; music, but of course I have no idea what that means. ;-) It<br/>has no melody (except ocassionally accidentally) and no rhythm. It<br/>uses a strictly justly-intoned scale but is &quot;atonal&quot;, thanks to the<br/>genius of Erv Wilson (and the computer programming expertise of Andy<br/>Fillebrown). It has been &quot;performed&quot; publically three times now.</p><p>Hey guys, I finally got to go to a public &quot;performance&quot; of it (since<br/>it was in my home town this time)! It was used to introduce a concert<br/>by the ensemble Topology &lt;<a href="http://www.topology.org.au/">http://www.topology.org.au/</a>&gt; with the theme<br/>&quot;Rational Melodies&quot;. Another piece in the concert was a marvelous<br/>viola solo that consisted almost entirely of harmonics on the C<br/>string, up to the 11th.</p><p>I totally agree with Julia that there is a lot more to music than JI.<br/>By why go so far in the other direction as to imply that JI harmonic<br/>resources are not even worth considering when deciding on the raw<br/>pitch materials from which to derive one&apos;s compositions.</p><p>Down with outrageous JI fundamentalist claims!<br/>But long live JI harmony (among other kinds).</p><p>It feels quite strange to be championing JI here. For most of my years<br/>on this list I have been cast as one of those nasty tET-ists, because<br/>(apart from my above &quot;composition&quot;) I generally insist on tempering<br/>scales (no matter how slightly).</p><p>Of course what I&apos;m really for is for more inclusiveness. Transcend,<br/>but include (at least the useful and fun stuff).</p><p>We should be presenting new would-be composers with a complete<br/>pallette of resources and telling (and showing) them what each has<br/>been found to be good for, at least in the past. We certainly<br/>shouldn&apos;t be talking utter nonsense such as 12-ET being like eating<br/>lots of red meat etc, but there&apos;s also no way we should be telling<br/>them, in effect, &quot;Don&apos;t even bother looking at (or listening to) that<br/>JI stuff, it&apos;s irrelevant&quot;.</p><p>There is no denying, if one holds the pitch of one note constant and<br/>moves another simultaneous one slowly up and down, that _very_special_<br/>sounds_ are heard at certain _very_sharply_defined_ intervals (whether<br/>you _like_ the sound of them or not). The same goes for three<br/>simultaneous notes and four notes etc. There are only a few JI dyads<br/>but even at four notes the number of possible JI chords is huge. Why<br/>would anyone want to deny the usefulness of those special sounds as a<br/>compositional resource? One doesn&apos;t need to know anything about<br/>arithmetic or partials to appreciate the specialness of those sounds.</p><p>Actually, Julia has explained why someone might want to deny their<br/>usefulness. It&apos;s because certain JI people and organisations (you&apos;re<br/>right, it wasn&apos;t a straw person, it was several real ones, my mistake)<br/>have been (and still are) going too far in the other direction,<br/>essentially claiming that JI is everything.</p><p>In many cases, I totally reject claims that certain scales or<br/>harmonies based on ratios are important simply _because_ they are<br/>based on ratios, and that the numbers are supposed to _explain_<br/>something. But I reject them in only those cases where quite large<br/>mistunings away from the stated ratios would go completely unnoticed<br/>by actual _listeners_.</p><p>Subliminal psychological and even physical healing effects (as has<br/>been claimed by some), for inaudible changes to tuning, cannot be<br/>rejected out of hand. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary<br/>evidence, and so far this evidence has not been forthcoming.</p><p>One also cannot deny JI fundamentalists the specialness of the numbers<br/>per se, on the mythic or magical level. Although we may not be able to<br/>_hear_ any difference in some cases, and indeed there may be no<br/>measurable effect, the knowledge on the part of the composer,<br/>performer and listener that the numbers are somehow &quot;in there&quot; can,<br/>for some people, form part of the enjoyment of the music. It is only<br/>when people operating on this mythic-magic level start making claims<br/>that can actually be tested on the rational level, that they go<br/>astray.</p><p>This is similar to the situation with astrology providing comfort to<br/>millions, despite having no basis in scientific fact. One needn&apos;t try<br/>to deny this comfort. On the other hand, if you knew someone had a<br/>disease that is treatable only by modern medicine but they insist on<br/>sticking to their astrologers or tarot card readers, you would try to<br/>convince them to do otherwise.</p><p>If I thought I was capable, I&apos;d be looking at ways to make<br/>voice-leading work _with_ the justly intoned sonorities (among<br/>others), not rejecting their importance.</p><p>The good thing is that 72-ET is close enough to 11-limit JI that new<br/>composers should eventually discover these special sonorities for<br/>themselves, and can then decide whether to use them: almost all the<br/>time, some of the time, or to try as they might to avoid them.</p><p>I think the distinction between JI and non-JI music is very<br/>unimportant. But composers and performers should definitely be taught<br/>that there are justly intoned harmonies and non just harmonies (and a<br/>grey area between them), not because of any numbers, but because they<br/>_sound_ different.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=38529 href="#38529">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2002 8:49:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave,</p><p>I&apos;ll keep it short, to conserve our precious bytes: that was one very<br/>fine post.

About 2 weeks ago I read the first 24 pages at<br/><a href="http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/preview/9967617">http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/preview/9967617</a><br/>which I understand contains all the sections relating to JI. Apparently, at that distance in time I was left with only the general flavour of your rejectyion of JI. I have just reread it now and will address specific points.</p><p>You are welcome to send a copy of the complete dissertation to<br/>Dave Keenan<br/>116 Bowman Parade<br/>Bardon QLD 4065<br/>AUSTRALIA<br/>in which case I will definitely read the whole thing.</p><p>I apologise that I have not read all your posts to the list. Recent ones have thankfully led me to understand that it is not that you do not think that just or near just intervals are worth having in a tuning system (for their special sounds) but that you reject the JI fundamentalist dogma that just (or near just) intervals are the fundamental consituents of melody and harmony.</p><p>But this distinction between the dogma and the intervals is far from clear in your paper. This is apparently because what you reject as JI theory in your paper is pretty much only the dogma, and when you do describe some psychoacoustic theory you misrepresent it. Such as that relating to sensory-dissonance. Incidentally it is called sensory-dissonance to distinguish it from contextual-dissonance, among other kinds. You see, we scientific JI theorists are quite aware that there are other influences on our perception of consonance, apart from the coincidence of partials.</p><p>It can easily be demonstrated that the perceived consonance of a sustained chord, in a harmonic or near-harmonic timbre, in the absence of any other musical context, is dependent to a _very_ large degree on the proximity of its component intervals to justly intoned intervals. You probably agree that this is not dogma. Now while I acknowledge that shorter sustain and musical context and lots of vibrato and different timbres etc etc, can alter this perception of consonance, I don&apos;t believe it can make a silk purse out of a sow&apos;s ear. I would be pleased to hear a demonstration that shows otherwise.</p><p>Of course if you were to reject science as _any_ kind of method of obtaining useful knowledge, as was at first suggested by your remark:</p><p>&quot;[Just intonation, as an idea] accomodates those who seek to apply a scientific model to music - perhaps a vestigial product of the Age of Reason.&quot;</p><p>then we wouldn&apos;t have much left to talk about. I would suspect you had caught a mild case of &quot;boomeritis&quot; (postmodern extreme relativism combined with narcissism) as it is very prevalent in the humanities departments of universities at the moment. See Ken Wilber&apos;s book of that name. In Wilber&apos;s view we should transcend but include science. It isn&apos;t everything, but it is not merely a &quot;social construction&quot; either.</p><p>Just to elaborate on something I wrote earlier:<br/>I should perhaps distinguish (at least) two kinds of nonscientific JI which I have been blurring together somewhat. There is JI fundamentalism (as mentioned above) and then there is JI numerology (which I earlier likened to astrology). There is no shame in being a JI numerologist (particularly if you admit that&apos;s what you are doing). We all enjoyed Jacky Ligon&apos;s &quot;I&apos;m a numerologist&quot; ditty. But there ought to be some shame in continuing to make fundamentalist claims which are testable on the rational level and are demonstrably false (such as those on Kyle Gann&apos;s and David Doty&apos;s web pages).</p><p>Now to some specifics of your paper.</p><p>You have misunderstood Partch&apos;s terms &quot;otonality&quot; and &quot;utonality&quot;. A single interval or dyad cannot be utonal or otonal, only assemblies of 3 or more notes can be one or the other. Also, we have since discovered some other kinds of maximally consonant JI chords that don&apos;t fit into Partch&apos;s otonal or utonal categories. We call one kind ASS&apos;s for (Anomalous Saturated Suspensions) and another kind we call &quot;magic&quot; which are necessarily tempered but still rely on proximity to JI for their relative consonance. I did suggest the acronym TITS for this second category (Theoretically Indispensably-Tempered Saturations) but perhaps to our credit, it never caught on. :=)</p><p>You wrote, in the last footnote on page 7,<br/>&quot;However, time has shown - as will this study - that these speculations were myopic: that the urge to &quot;fill the gaps&quot; between the 12 equal tempered intervals in order to /expand/ the vocabulary and the desire to respect the overtone series are in fact very different, even mutually exclusive, and therefore incompatible.&quot;</p><p>If I take a very literal interpretation of that sentence then I suppose it is true. But it assumes that we want to leave the 12 equal notes where they are and merely add more. This is not usually the case. It also assumes we want to have most of the notes being multiples of a common &quot;fundamental&quot; or a very few common &quot;fundamentals&quot; (maybe a tonic, dominant and subdominant). This is not necessarily so either.</p><p>You should learn about Erv Wilson&apos;s family of atonal justly intoned scales called CPS&apos;s (combination product sets) which are in one sense the complete opposite of Partch&apos;s monophony.</p><p>That footnote certainly invites interpretation as saying that the desire to have justly intoned intervals is incompatible with the urge to expand the musical vocabulary. Which is of course nonsense.</p><p>p 8<br/>You say:<br/>&quot;Just intonation is specifically a vertical view of music ..&quot;.<br/>I say:<br/>&quot;Just intonation is an important property of the vertical aspect of music.&quot;</p><p>Further on page 8 you actually say that just intonation requires all pitches to have a strict relationship to a fundamental. This seems to imply that all pitches must have a _just_ relationship to the fundamental. This would be an incredibly narrow version of JI, and is just not so.</p><p>You also imply (on p8) that JI composers do not regard consonance and dissonance as relative. This is not so. In fact one popular rule of thumb says that the sensory-dissonance of a just interval is roughly proportional to the product of the two sides of the ratio when in lowest terms. e.g. A just minor sixth of 5:8 is considerably more consonant than a just neutral sixth of 8:13. And when this product gets up around 120 then it&apos;s pretty much not Just any more (at least not on its own).</p><p>You say that:<br/>&quot;Acoustics obviously do play a /partial/ role ...&quot; and you admit it might explain the consonance of octaves and fifths.</p><p>But then you apparently think you are going on to refute some psychoacoustic results, or at least their relevance to music, when in fact you are refuting only your own (or possibly others) misrepresentations of them.</p><p>In a footnote that spans pages 9 and 10 you write (and by the way it&apos;s annoying not to be able to just copy and paste quotes from your paper, like I can with anyone&apos;s posts to this list):</p><p>&quot;But even here there is ambiguity: is the next most consonant interval [after octave and fifth] determined by the next new /pitch class/ to appear, measured against the /fundamental/ i.e. the major third (followed in rank by the minor seventh), or by the /interval/ created by the /adjacency/ between the third and the very next (fourth) partial - i.e. the perfect fourth.&quot;</p><p>Well I thing it&apos;s the fourth (3:4). What theory says that it would be the major third (4:5) or the (sub)minor seventh (4:7)? However we do recognise that we seem to find frequency ratios where the smallest number is a power of two (the &quot;fundamental&quot; in your terminology) to be more consonant than would be suggested by the simple rule of thumb given above. But so what if there is some ambiguity about which has the greater sensory-consonance, 3:4 or 4:5? I don&apos;t think anyone would suggest that 4:7 is more consonant than 3:4.</p><p>By the way, when &quot;beats&quot; are too fast to be perceived as variations of timbre over time, or as countable events, then we call it &quot;roughness&quot;.</p><p>You claim on page 10 that psychoacoustical theory predicts that an equal tempered minor sixth must be dissonant and you say you experience it as such out of musical context, but as consonant in a diatonic context.</p><p>In fact current theory, as I understand it, predicts that the 12-ET m6 should have some intermediate kind of consonance/dissonance which musical context could easily turn to relative consonance. But really, how often do you find a verticality consisting of a _bare_ minor sixth functioning as a consonance? And of course timbre, register and the sheer span of an interval are important determinants. You seem to imply on page 11 that JI types or psychoacousticians deny these influences. In fact we&apos;ve discussed them many times at length on this list.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that the &quot;jarring&quot; ocurrence of a perfect fifth in a certain context can be considered an example of it being perceived as dissonant.</p><p>I&apos;ve run out of time today, but let me say that nothing you describe on page 11 goes in any way against any of the JI or psychoacoustic theory that I currently use. Maybe they do go against something Helmhotz said, but the field hasn&apos;t been standing still since Helmholtz. And page 12 is infuriating for its obvious lack of understanding of the scientific method. It&apos;s _supposed_ to change with time. It&apos;s supposed to become a more accurate description of reality. Of course it&apos;s very difficult to get at what that reality is when it resides in the heads of many different people and is influenced by culture (which itself changes).</p><p>On another tack, I understand that you personally wish to avoid associations with diatonic or common-practice music (or 12-equal in general) so as to attempt to define a new musical dialect. Many of us on this list could apply JI theory (of the scientific non-dogmatic kind) to help you in this goal, by finding or designing scales and tuning systems that avoid intervals close to ratios of 3 or 5 but still providing for extremes of consonance and dissonance by using ratios of 7, 9 and 11 to provide the extreme consonance, and without everything referring to a single fundamental. Disssonance is easy but consonance is hard to put into a tuning system that also has desirable melodic properties, particularly if you want to avoid diatonic implications. But scientific JI theory can help us to do it. We might even find for you, subsets of 72-equal that are more manageable than the full 72 but are still likely to satisfy your requirements.</p><p>I&apos;m looking forward to hearing you make a bare 833 cent interval sound like a consonance (using a harmonic timbre). :-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=38571 href="#38571">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2002 12:18:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;(you&apos;re<br/>&gt; right, it wasn&apos;t a straw person, it was several real ones, my<br/>&gt;mistake)</p><p>dave, i must disagree. david doty, in the just intonation primer,<br/>delves enthusiastically into quite discordant just intonation chords<br/>such as the &quot;supermajor seventh chord&quot; (14:18:21:27). kyle gann,<br/>meanwhile, has no particular attachment to the first six partials,<br/>something one can find ample evidence for in both his websites and<br/>his music (which i&apos;ve seen him perform to much delight).</p><p>the &quot;just intonation&quot; entity/credo that julia defines in her paper,<br/>the one she says &quot;limits the composer stylistically to a sparse,<br/>simple triadic idiom&quot;, *is* a straw man. she hasn&apos;t named, even in<br/>the footnotes, a single composer or theorist who could serve as a<br/>consistent example of such a view. meanwhile, she would have us<br/>believe that it is the just intonationists who are being<br/>inconsistent, who are violating their own dogma, any time they write<br/>interesting music or posit interesting sonorities. the nerve!</p><p>my sense is that only in current academia, where interest and study<br/>in just intonation and the history of tuning and acoustics have been<br/>swept aside (under the rug, in fact) in favor of &quot;set theory&quot; (which<br/>sprung from atonal quandaries and has come to take over even<br/>discussions of the diatonic scale in tonal music) and related<br/>abstractions, could the argument in the first part of werntz&apos;s paper<br/>or dissertation fly among serious musical thinkers. all too happy to<br/>dismiss and ignore just intonation, not only its merits but also its<br/>difficult problems, no one in the academe even raises an eyebrow over<br/>such a narrowly-founded and poorly-researched premise and argument.</p><p>oh well, i can get over it. we all agree that the new intervals need<br/>a chance to speak for themselves. and in the end, i guess that&apos;s what<br/>really counts . . .</p></div><h3><a id=38572 href="#38572">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2002 12:21:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote [#38532]:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But 72-equal is still a strange scale to use if you want to avoid<br/>&gt; 12-equal.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote [#38559]:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Julia,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please don&apos;t give up on us yet. ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

If I were going to avoid diatonic and 12-ET intervals, I would<br/>pick a division of the octave that would be as far removed from both<br/>of those as possible, e.g., 11, 13, or 23-ET.</p><p>In fact I did just that around 30 years ago, when I retuned an<br/>electronic organ to 11-ET and improvised a fugue, one part at a time,<br/>on tape.  It was quick and easy and quite a lot of fun in that I had<br/>the freedom to do whatever I felt without worrying about how the<br/>vertical harmony was going to come out (and without any concern about<br/>adhering to a tone row).  By selecting a suitable tonal system, I<br/>found that I had no problem achieving the &quot;atonal&quot; (pardon the term)<br/>effect that I was after.</p><p>Some others on the Tuning List have since done quite a bit more with<br/>ET&apos;s of this sort, as I found out recently.</p><p>I&apos;m not about to recommend that you abandon 72-ET for something else,<br/>however.  There is so much available in 72 that, as Dave Keenan<br/>suggested above, I think it would be possible to find subsets with<br/>properties similar to the ET&apos;s that I mentioned above.  These would<br/>give you the option of using the tones either serially or freely, as<br/>you wish.</p><p>One subset of 72 that might be employed successfully in this manner<br/>is 8-ET.  Although it contains the diminished seventh chords of 12-<br/>ET, it is very un-diatonic and might be used to good effect in a<br/>portion of a composition.</p><p>I believe that you could simulate 11-ET in 72-ET by using a series of<br/>tones generated by an interval of 13 degrees:</p><p>deg72  nearest ratio<br/> 0      1:1<br/>13     15:17<br/>26      7:9<br/>39     11:16<br/>52     17:28<br/>65     15:28<br/> 6     17:18<br/>19      5:6<br/>32     11:15<br/>45     11:17 or 13:20<br/>58      4:7</p><p>This would give the following scale (in degrees of 72):</p><p>  0  6  13  19  26  32  39  45  52  58  65  72</p><p>This results in the almost complete avoidance of 12-ET intervals<br/>(exception: the 12-ET semitone &amp; major 7th), as well as excluding<br/>most of the intervals that approximate low-number JI ratios.  (I have<br/>included the nearest ratio suggested by each tone in the table above;<br/>observe that most of them are double-digits.)</p><p>These are just a couple of possibilities that I came up with off the<br/>top of my head.

And thanks for your<br/>well-considered remarks. Just a couple of little points, to add to my statements in<br/>my other post of today. I&apos;d be happy to meet after I get back next week.</p><p>&gt; the &quot;just intonation&quot; entity/credo that julia defines in her paper,<br/>&gt; the one she says &quot;limits the composer stylistically to a sparse,<br/>&gt; simple triadic idiom&quot;, *is* a straw man. she hasn&apos;t named, even in<br/>&gt; the footnotes, a single composer or theorist who could serve as a<br/>&gt; consistent example of such a view.</p><p>No, I didn&apos;t, though I must say I&apos;ve heard a good deal of such music. I was not at all<br/>interested in publicly attacking anyone&apos;s music (and I still am not interested), so I<br/>presented it in a hypothetical way, the main point there anyway being that a<br/>harmonic vocabulary of 2/1, 3/2 5/4 and 7/4 *would be* quite limiting, after having<br/>made my other point about overtones, beats, etc. (See my other post from today<br/>about that latter point.)</p><p>&gt; my sense is that only in current academia, where interest and study<br/>&gt; in just intonation and the history of tuning and acoustics have been<br/>&gt; swept aside (under the rug, in fact) in favor of &quot;set theory&quot; (which<br/>&gt; sprung from atonal quandaries and has come to take over even<br/>&gt; discussions of the diatonic scale in tonal music) and related<br/>&gt; abstractions, could the argument in the first part of werntz&apos;s paper<br/>&gt; or dissertation fly among serious musical thinkers. all too happy to<br/>&gt; dismiss and ignore just intonation, not only its merits but also its<br/>&gt; difficult problems, no one in the academe even raises an eyebrow over<br/>&gt; such a narrowly-founded and poorly-researched premise and argument.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It may be that certain corners of the American academe refuse to accept just<br/>intonation. But you may be interested to know that it could hardly have been<br/>worse for Joe Maneri at the New England Conservatory (microtonal course<br/>notwithstanding) in terms of acceptance and recognition, and that for most of my<br/>time at Brandeis, up until hip David Rakowski arrived on the faculty and agreed to<br/>advise me on my thesis, it is no exaggeration to say that I was laughed at and<br/>publicly humiliated for composing with microtones and presenting microtonal<br/>works in analysis class, and was even told not to compose with microtones as long<br/>as I was there! (By the time I left, I think I may have softened some of them, but<br/>not without much bitter heartache.) In addition, I have been rejected repeatedly<br/>from certain &quot;establishment&quot; conferences and competitions, specifically for<br/>submitting microtonal works. In fact, I have sometimes felt that Joe Maneri and I<br/>and his other students who study microtones don&apos;t fit in anywhere as<br/>microtonalists, other than in our own &quot;scene&quot; here in Boston. All of this is not<br/>intended to make anyone feel sorry for us (we&apos;re fine), but to respond to the<br/>absurd notion that we somehow represent &quot;current academia.&quot; (!)</p><p>Although I believed that my PNM essay was well written and well thought-out, I<br/>was almost surprised that they accepted my paper. No one recommended me or<br/>pulled strings for me there, nor had anyone there presumably ever heard of me.<br/>And call me naive (again), but considering that the PNM editorial board includes<br/>some &quot;friends of just intonation&quot; such as Larry Polansky and Pauline Oliveros, and<br/>that their 1991 Forum On Microtonality featured mostly JI and pure-tuning<br/>microtonalists, I have no reason to believe that I was playing into someone&apos;s<br/>agenda with the views in my paper.

This is apparently because what you &gt; reject as JI theory in your paper is pretty much only the &gt; dogma, and when you do describe some psychoacoustic theory you &gt; misrepresent it. Such as that relating to sensory-dissonance. &gt; Incidentally it is called sensory-dissonance to distinguish it &gt; from contextual-dissonance, among other kinds. You see, we &gt; scientific JI theorists are quite aware that there are other &gt; influences on our perception of consonance, apart from the &gt; coincidence of partials.</p><p>&gt; It can easily be demonstrated that the perceived consonance of &gt; a sustained chord, in a harmonic or near-harmonic timbre, in &gt; the absence of any other musical context, is dependent to a &gt; _very_ large degree on the proximity of its component intervals &gt; to justly intoned intervals.</p><p>Brown can be demonstrated to be in close proximity to red. So what ? Is brown any less valid in it&apos;s existence ? What b.s.</p><p>&gt;  You probably agree that this is not dogma. Now while I &gt; acknowledge that shorter sustain and musical context and lots &gt; of vibrato and different timbres etc etc, can alter this &gt; perception of consonance, I don&apos;t believe it can make a silk &gt; purse out of a sow&apos;s ear. I would be pleased to hear a &gt; demonstration that shows otherwise.</p><p>And how does the JI proponent know she/he is not making a sow&apos;s ear out of a silk purse ?</p><p>&gt; Of course if you were to reject science as _any_ kind of method &gt; of obtaining useful knowledge, as was at first suggested by &gt; your remark:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;[Just intonation, as an idea] accomodates those who seek to &gt; apply a scientific model to music - perhaps a vestigial product &gt; of the Age of Reason.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; then we wouldn&apos;t have much left to talk about. I would suspect &gt; you had caught a mild case of &quot;boomeritis&quot; (postmodern extreme &gt; relativism combined with narcissism) as it is very prevalent in &gt; the humanities departments of universities at the moment. See &gt; Ken Wilber&apos;s book of that name. In Wilber&apos;s view we should &gt; transcend but include science. It isn&apos;t everything, but it is &gt; not merely a &quot;social construction&quot; either.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s not how I interpret the above quote. I don&apos;t think this is Pythagorean v/s Aristoxenian situation you make it out to be. Think Ptolemy, Nicomachus, maybe.</p><p>From &lt;<a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week3sum.html">http://humanities.uchicago.edu/classes/zbikowski/week3sum.html</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;the entire judgment is not to be granted to the sense of hearing; rather, reason must also play a role. Reason should guide and moderate the erring sense, inasmuch as the sense-tottering and failing-should be supported, as it were, by a walking stick.&apos;</p><p>&apos;According to Ptolemy the harmonic scholar directs his activity in such a way that what the sense estimates, reason weighs; accordingly, reason searches out ratios to which the sense expresses no objection.&apos;</p><p>&gt; Now to some specifics of your paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You have misunderstood Partch&apos;s terms &quot;otonality&quot; and &gt; &quot;utonality&quot;. A single interval or dyad cannot be utonal or &gt; otonal, only assemblies of 3 or more notes can be one or the &gt; other. Also, we have since discovered some other kinds of &gt; maximally consonant JI chords that don&apos;t fit into Partch&apos;s &gt; otonal or utonal categories. We call one kind ASS&apos;s for &gt; (Anomalous Saturated Suspensions) and another kind we call &gt; &quot;magic&quot; which are necessarily tempered but still rely on &gt; proximity to JI for their relative consonance. I did suggest &gt; the acronym TITS for this second category (Theoretically &gt; Indispensably-Tempered Saturations) but perhaps to our credit, &gt; it never caught on. :=)</p><p>So, will JI dogma be twisted to include and explain all this, like holy astronomers ? I&apos;m just kidding, I don&apos;t need or use JI to validate my musical thought. Between HI, RI, CI, &amp; various generators yielding fractional and other generated intonations, there&apos;s a much bigger and more inclusive playground. And who are these keepers of the holy writ you keep referring to as &apos;we&apos; ?</p><p>&gt; You wrote, in the last footnote on page 7,<br/>&gt; &quot;However, time has shown - as will this study - that these &gt; speculations were myopic: that the urge to &quot;fill the gaps&quot; &gt; between the 12 equal tempered intervals in order to /expand/ &gt; the vocabulary and the desire to respect the overtone series &gt; are in fact very different, even mutually exclusive, and &gt; therefore incompatible.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I take a very literal interpretation of that sentence then I &gt; suppose it is true. But it assumes that we want to leave the 12 &gt; equal notes where they are and merely add more. This is not &gt; usually the case. It also assumes we want to have most of the &gt; notes being multiples of a common &quot;fundamental&quot; or a very few &gt; common &quot;fundamentals&quot; (maybe a tonic, dominant and &gt; subdominant). This is not necessarily so either.</p><p>Perhaps she&apos;s referring to a specific case and specific aspect, not making a generalisation ? Rhetorical.</p><p>&gt; That footnote certainly invites interpretation as saying that &gt; the desire to have justly intoned intervals is incompatible &gt; with the urge to expand the musical vocabulary. Which is of &gt; course nonsense.</p><p>As would be such an interpretation itself. It does not invite such an interpretation. If you look at it through tainted lenses, you may perceive it to be tainted.</p><p>&gt; p 8<br/>&gt; You say:<br/>&gt; &quot;Just intonation is specifically a vertical view of music ..&quot;.<br/>&gt; I say:<br/>&gt; &quot;Just intonation is an important property of the vertical &gt; aspect of music.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further on page 8 you actually say that just intonation &gt; requires all pitches to have a strict relationship to a &gt; fundamental.</p><p>This is more or less true, in context.</p><p>&gt; This seems to imply that all pitches must have a _just_ &gt; relationship to the fundamental.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t interpret it as implying this, unless I *wanted* to see it that way...</p><p>&gt; You also imply (on p8) that JI composers do not regard &gt; consonance and dissonance as relative.</p><p>I would be inclined to think many JI proponents invoke this perception.</p><p>&gt; This is not so. In fact one popular rule of thumb says that the &gt; sensory-dissonance of a just interval is roughly proportional &gt; to the product of the two sides of the ratio when in lowest &gt; terms. e.g. A just minor sixth of 5:8 is considerably more &gt; consonant than a just neutral sixth of 8:13. And when this &gt; product gets up around 120 then it&apos;s pretty much not Just any &gt; more (at least not on its own).</p><p>Why do you JI types insist on proving everything and anything by reducing it to &apos;lowest terms&apos; ? It&apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>&gt; On another tack, I understand that you personally wish to avoid &gt; associations with diatonic or common-practice music (or &gt; 12-equal in general) so as to attempt to define a new musical &gt; dialect. Many of us on this list could apply JI theory (of the &gt; scientific non-dogmatic kind) to help you in this goal, by &gt; finding or designing scales and tuning systems that avoid &gt; intervals close to ratios of 3 or 5 but still providing for &gt; extremes of consonance and dissonance by using ratios of 7, 9 &gt; and 11 to provide the extreme consonance, and without &gt; everything referring to a single fundamental. Disssonance is &gt; easy but consonance is hard to put into a tuning system that &gt; also has desirable melodic properties, particularly if you want &gt; to avoid diatonic implications. But scientific JI theory can &gt; help us to do it. We might even find for you, subsets of &gt; 72-equal that are more manageable than the full 72 but are &gt; still likely to satisfy your requirements.</p><p>Oh so patronising ! And imagine what I&apos;d think if this were directed at me.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m looking forward to hearing you make a bare 833 cent &gt; interval sound like a consonance (using a harmonic timbre). :-)</p><p>What sort of consonance ? Just curious. And I&apos;m pretty certain it can be done. But the question is will someone like find it consonant or admit it if they do ?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=38600 href="#38600">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2002 12:37:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wednesday, July 10, 2002, at 02:31 , <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt; Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hello Joe!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     My objection to the use of the tern is that it implies that &gt; practitioners of JI try to impose it on others.</p><p>The &apos;true path&apos; ideology of JI is implied often enough, perhaps sometimes unwittingly.</p><p>&gt; In Case of Fact I have<br/>&gt; seen more insistence of the contrary on this list.

In fact one popular rule of thumb says that the<br/>&gt; &gt; sensory-dissonance of a just interval is roughly proportional<br/>&gt; &gt; to the product of the two sides of the ratio when in lowest<br/>&gt; &gt; terms. e.g. A just minor sixth of 5:8 is considerably more<br/>&gt; &gt; consonant than a just neutral sixth of 8:13. And when this<br/>&gt; &gt; product gets up around 120 then it&apos;s pretty much not Just any<br/>&gt; &gt; more (at least not on its own).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why do you JI types insist on proving everything and anything by<br/>&gt; reducing it to &apos;lowest terms&apos; ?

Disssonance is<br/>&gt; &gt; easy but consonance is hard to put into a tuning system that<br/>&gt; &gt; also has desirable melodic properties, particularly if you want<br/>&gt; &gt; to avoid diatonic implications.

That last paragraph of yours to Julia did come across as patronising. I&apos;m sorry I had to say it. And were you referring to all 500+ members of this forum ? It most definitely does not include me.</p><p>&gt; I particularly loved this one:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Why do you JI types insist on proving everything and anything by<br/>&gt;&gt; reducing it to &apos;lowest terms&apos; ?

I thought there<br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; no super<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; book and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     you have confirmed that. Looking at what you call &quot;advanced<br/>&gt; &gt; work&quot; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what I call<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     gibberish.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***Well, Stephen, maybe it *won&apos;t* be though after you&apos;ve read<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; *other* books.. :)  That&apos;s the point... :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It will still be gibberish. You may take your courage and a few<br/>math<br/>&gt; textbooks in hand, and plunge in, if you wish.</p><p>***That&apos;s *Tuning Math,* Gene!  For *this* list one only needs a<br/>general knowledge of tuning concepts, terms (which are not that<br/>difficult to pick up if one hangs around) and high school algebra,<br/>for the most part...  :)</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
