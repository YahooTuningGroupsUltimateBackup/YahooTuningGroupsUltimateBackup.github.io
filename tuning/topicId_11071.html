That&apos;s why I asked.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Incidentally, I&apos;ve never caught Partch contradicting himself<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then you have lots of reading to do, because I don&apos;t have the time to<br/>&gt;point out even the beginnings of his inherent contradictions. Hell, his<br/>&gt;life was a contradiction, but I have to go to work this morning...</p><p>I&apos;ve read every word published on Partch, by Partch, that I&apos;m aware<br/>of, at least once.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Gilmore states this too, but every one of his examples reveal a<br/>&gt;&gt;gross misunderstanding of the man and his work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Wow. Bob and I have totally missed the boat on Harry. Amazing...</p><p>Gilmore&apos;s biography is excellent, priceless.  But his POV is, IMO,<br/>that of an outsider -- a stranger -- to Partch&apos;s work and ideals.<br/>I&apos;ve outlined some of the reasons I think this here before.  You<br/>know I don&apos;t think the same of you, and I hope you don&apos;t consider<br/>my post -- which I thought a natural reaction to the tone of your<br/>posts -- at all violent.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=11087 href="#11087">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2000 7:22:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Incidentally, I&apos;ve never caught Partch contradicting himself<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Then you have lots of reading to do, because I don&apos;t have the time to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;point out even the beginnings of his inherent contradictions.

Partch&apos;s output is<br/>every bit as consistent, or moreso, than any output of a man&apos;s life<br/>I&apos;m familiar with.</p><p>&gt;I could probably write a paper on the contradictions in _Genesis_,<br/>&gt;alone.</p><p>If you&apos;ve got him in conflict of purpose or intent, I&apos;d like to hear<br/>it.  I&apos;m not particularly interested in wether he likes his peas.  I<br/>know of nothing in _Genesis_, or anywhere else, that could possibly<br/>justify Szanto&apos;s statement that Partch was a man of contradictions, or<br/>that dealing with contradictions is crucial to understanding Partch<br/>or his work.  Reminds me of the cheap stuff historians have used to<br/>describe the early presidents.  &quot;There were two Thomas Jeffersons...&quot;<br/>There&apos;s a difference between waffling and balancing a tricky situation<br/>towards a single goal.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
