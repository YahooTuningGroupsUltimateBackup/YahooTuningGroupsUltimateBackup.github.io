In other<br/>&gt; words, REGARDLESS of the tuning materials, a talented and perceptive<br/>&gt; individual is going to come up with some good music (??)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, absolutely. But I&apos;m really, however ineptly, trying to get at<br/>&gt; something much more specific here. I can see it, and I can hear it,<br/>&gt; but I&apos;m no doubt having a difficult time explaining it very well...<br/>&gt; and unfortunately I can&apos;t really say much more than what I&apos;ve already<br/>&gt; said. Sorry. Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to articulate this better at some<br/>&gt; point.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Couldn&apos;t have said it better myself. Seriously, I followed the<br/>temperment vs non-temperment discussion and my (unwritten)<br/>additions would have been along the lines that there is a<br/>&quot;an ineffable magic to approximating a system with distinguishable<br/>and regular quanta that is different from, but no less and<br/>possibly more profound, than the original system itself.&quot; In<br/>the limited tuning table experiments I did, I found that<br/>12-of-N ets which approximated a certain just set STILL had a<br/>regularity that the just counterparts didn&apos;t have, which I found<br/>preferable.</p><p>The &apos;cracks&apos; you mentioned Tatum finding made me think of different<br/>kinds of games one can play in tunings, like converting a mathematical<br/>series into intervals and playing it either melodically or as a chord.<br/>(1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 =&gt; C Db Eb E G Ab C Db Gb). Not a good musical<br/>example, but when you play lines like this where the mind can solve<br/>the pattern AND the musical resolution of that pattern is a &apos;crack&apos;<br/>(perhaps and unexpected concord or discord)... Part of that magic<br/>in an et is that that crack is an unexpected part of the sytem,<br/>like seeing a never before seen crystal. In an irregular system,<br/>I feel like &quot;the crack is HERE, I can&apos;t find it anywhere else,<br/>and I can&apos;t make it go away&quot;, (which may lend itself wonderfully<br/>to exploring in a more modal/drone oriented music).</p><p>Its a different tastes thing, but there IS something there.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 10:46:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert C Valentine wrote,</p><p>&gt; but when you play lines like this where the mind can solve the<br/>pattern AND the musical resolution of that pattern is a &apos;crack&apos;<br/>(perhaps and unexpected concord or discord)...</p><p>Hi Robert, thanks for weighing in. JdL once used the term &quot;creatures<br/>of equal temperament&quot; in the context of stacked chords, as in stacks<br/>of fifths or the augmented triad&apos;s stack of thirds... and there are of<br/>course all sorts of other &quot;creatures,&quot; like the upper extensions of<br/>jazz chords, symmetrical scales and the like as well... and in a<br/>certain sense it&apos;s fairly easy to theoretically project certain<br/>proportional characteristics of 12-tET into other tunings; I do it<br/>quite a bit, and all the Balzano generalized diatonics and other<br/>likeminded systems are loaded with symmetries of the sort that are<br/>indigenous to 12-tET. However, I&apos;m much more interested in what sorts<br/>of like &quot;creatures&quot; might arise out of some of the more fairly common<br/>and widely used alternate ETs (and especially a music first theory<br/>later type situation). 19 is especially interesting in this regard as<br/>it has a history, a la Yasser, that speaks of emerging potentials, of<br/>a present adumbrating a future... yet, much like the Balzano types of<br/>generalized diatonic scales, it would seem to require a nearly<br/>complete break with tonality as know it, and I&apos;m not aware of any real<br/>&quot;school&quot; of folks who are seriously digging in and making a lot of<br/>music in either the Balzano like generalized diatonics (despite their<br/>wealth of convenient or familiar symmetries and proportions) or the<br/>Yasser/Fibonacci like 12-out-of-19, 19-out-of-31, etc. types of<br/>systems. 19-tET however has been and is being used quite a bit, and<br/>right here on this list we have the Colorado crew (in the persons of<br/>by Neil Haverstick and John Starrett) digging right in and making<br/>music that recasts a lot of familiar structural and tonal ways of<br/>going about things into the fresh palette of 19-tET... so how bout it<br/>guys; any 21st century &quot;creatures of equal temperament&quot; making<br/>themselves known in 19 yet? While 19 shares 12&apos;s status as an<br/>excellent low order approximator of a good fifth and a good third, it<br/>certainly doesn&apos;t share 12&apos;s often exploited divisibility, so it<br/>should be very interesting to see what sorts of 19-tET &quot;creatures&quot;<br/>might avail themselves musically when a lot of the lingo is a sort of<br/>12-tET transfer to 19! We&apos;ll see.</p><p>&gt; Part of that magic in an et is that that crack is an unexpected part<br/>of the sytem, like seeing a never before seen crystal.
