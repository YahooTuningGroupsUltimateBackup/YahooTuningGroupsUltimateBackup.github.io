TBX1 can hold 512 full range<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; MIDI tunings at once. Scala files are easily imported and converted to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; .tbx format. Tbx files can be uploaded to TBX1 in a batch. Once<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; uploaded, they are all accessible at the push of a button. The process<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of deciding on preset tunings included an analysis of the Scala<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; archive. The chosen files were renamed according to the TBX1 tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; naming convention, which is as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) The most important thing a newcomer needs to know about a tuning is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how many notes it contains, so begin the name of the file with the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; number of notes in the scale, followed by a dash; e.g. 12-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Filenames should be concise and should not include spaces or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; underscores or other characters which simply take up space, so use<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; uppercase and lowercase letters, putting words together as is often<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; done in computer programming; e.g. ThisTuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) Limit the name to 16 characters (this is a current limitation of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the TBX1 LCD display, which is a 16x2 character display. The 16<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; character limitation does not include the 3 letter file extension).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Convey the most important information about the tuning in the name<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; itself, with priorities in this order:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; structure<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; geography<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Proper Name (e.g. of the scale&apos;s attributed inventor)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; history<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; An example file name using these conventions is 12-5LimitJI, or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7-Boethius<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; These are the conventions used for .tbx files. I propose that these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; conventions, or something very close to them, should be adopted for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; naming of Scala files. If the Scala archive were to have all of its<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; files renamed according to this convention, it would be much, much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; easier to navigate. Over 3000 files is a lot to deal with, but the task<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of converting names could be accomplished by dividing the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; responsibility amongst tuning list member volunteers. A person works<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on, say 100 files and submit the results, some alternatives may be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; suggested, alterations may be made, and final names are decided upon.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yours,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aaron Hunt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; H-Pi Instruments<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.h-pi.com">http://www.h-pi.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=70707 href="#70707">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2007 3:27:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I went through the Scala file list here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/scalesdir.txt">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/scalesdir.txt</a><br/>&gt; and made my own spreadsheet from it<br/>&gt; which I then sorted according to numbers<br/>&gt; of tones.</p><p>A txt file of the scales sorted by number of tones would be nice.</p></div><h3><a id=70708 href="#70708">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2007 3:27:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I went through the Scala file list here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/scalesdir.txt">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/scalesdir.txt</a><br/>&gt; and made my own spreadsheet from it<br/>&gt; which I then sorted according to numbers<br/>&gt; of tones.</p><p>A txt file of the scales sorted by number of tones would be nice.</p></div><h3><a id=70711 href="#70711">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2007 3:50:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One or another aspect will at one or another<br/>&gt; time be useful for categorization, and scale<br/>&gt; source is certainly a useful thing to know,<br/>&gt; but the first most basic consideration from<br/>&gt; a practical standpoint of music-making is<br/>&gt; the number of pitches in a scale.</p><p>In order to sort scales for a listing, I would suggest the following:</p><p>(1) Separate out the nonoctave scales</p><p>(2) Sort the nonoctave scales in terms first of period, and then number<br/>of scale steps in a period</p><p>(3) Sort the octave scales by number of steps, and then within that by<br/>decreasing Lumma stability</p></div><h3><a id=70712 href="#70712">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2007 4:08:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It should be made possible to sort scales by any criterion.
