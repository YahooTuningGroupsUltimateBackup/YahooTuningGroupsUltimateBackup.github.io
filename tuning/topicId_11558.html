Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2000 6:42:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Pierre Lamothe and everyone.</p><p>Please let me begin by thanking you for directing me to your<br/>fascinating Web site and graphical diagram of &quot;constitutive&quot;<br/>sonorities.</p><p>May I warmly assure you also that your English is much better than my<br/>French, for which your Web page provides a welcome exercise.<br/>Incidentally, I much admire the French musical tradition for keeping<br/>Guido&apos;s solmization syllable _ut_.</p><p>Possibly the question of language is an especially apt metaphor here,<br/>for we may be speaking different musical languages, and different<br/>theoretical languages to explain this music. Communnication can be a<br/>delicate process -- and a precious one, which I wish to treat with a<br/>care to match your courtesy and hospitality.</p><p>Before deciding whether &quot;constitutive&quot; sonorities or &quot;extensions&quot; are<br/>concepts which might apply to medieval and Renaissance European music,<br/>I need better to understand these concepts.</p><p>Your Web site provides illustrations tied to a key system like that of<br/>Rameau, by which I mean, for example:</p><p>(1) Sonorities are built are mainly in thirds, and are organized into<br/>major and minor keys (your examples being in C major and A minor);</p><p>(2) The text of your Web page focuses specifically on Rameau&apos;s<br/>dominant seventh and its resolution; and</p><p>(3) Notes of vertical sonorities are derived as overtones of a tonic.</p><p>Are these assumptions inherent in the &quot;constitutive&quot; and &quot;extension&quot;<br/>concepts, or is 18th-century tonality here used as one possible<br/>illustration of what may be wider concepts applying to other musics<br/>also?</p><p>Possibly we may need to engage in a bit of dialogue in order to answer<br/>these questions, and I feel that the best first step is for me seek a<br/>further explanation of &quot;constitutive&quot; and &quot;extension,&quot; and to listen<br/>very carefully to what you say.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that I practice and analyze mainly European<br/>styles from around 1200 to 1600 or a bit later, or roughly from<br/>Perotin to Monteverdi, and may not be the best person to evaluate your<br/>proposals regarding key-based music of the 18th century and later.</p><p>Where I might be able best to help, for example, is on such points as<br/>distinguishing Zarlino&apos;s approach from the very different approach of<br/>Rameau. While Zarlino&apos;s gamut was regarded by an 18th-century theorist<br/>such as Kirnberger (1771) as the usual &quot;modern&quot; gamut, and so is very<br/>rightly mentioned on your Web page, Zarlino&apos;s 16th-century musical<br/>world was often greatly misunderstood.</p><p>Above all, I am moved by your interest in historical questions very<br/>important to me, and hope to speak always in a spirit of friendship.</p><p>Concerning your Web page, I find that you raise one question about<br/>18th-century music which may be of special interest from the viewpoint<br/>of tuning and the theory of consonance/dissonance. Given the<br/>18th-century setting, I shall feel free to use 18th-century terms.</p><p>This question is which &quot;chord of four tones&quot; (not including octaves)<br/>is &quot;the most consonant&quot; in a style like that of Rameau.</p><p>If asked this question, I might propose Rameau&apos;s &quot;added sixth,&quot; for<br/>example F3-A3-C4-D4 (or f-a-c&apos;-d&apos;), which might be tuned 12:15:18:20.<br/>The only dissonant interval in this chord is the major second between<br/>the highest two voices, here tuned at 20:18 or 10:9. The other five<br/>intervals are all consonances: (M6 + 5 + 4 + M3 + m3 + M2).</p><p>Rameau interestingly comments that most musicians go wrong, because<br/>they regard the added sixth chord as a consonance, not taking account<br/>of the major second between two of the upper voices. Possibly the fact<br/>that all of the upper voices form consonances with the bass may help<br/>to explain the rather gentle effect of this sonority.</p><p>In contrast, Rameau&apos;s dominant seventh chord has two dissonances: the<br/>minor seventh above the bass, and the tritone between the voices at the<br/>major third and minor seventh above the bass. Here the six intervals<br/>are: (m7 + 5 + d5 + M3 + m3 + m3).</p><p>There are various just tunings for this latter sonority: 20:25:30:36;<br/>or 36:45:54:64; or 4:5:6:7. In a meantone or well-temperament of<br/>Rameau&apos;s era, something between the first and second tunings seems to<br/>me much more likely than the third.</p><p>Whatever the tunings, I suspect that the added sixth chord would be<br/>judged milder or &quot;more consonant&quot; than the dominant seventh chord in<br/>an 18th-century setting.</p><p>I would be curious to see how people more familiar with 18th-century<br/>style might approach this question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=11612 href="#11612">ðŸ”—</a>George Kahrimanis &#x3C;anakreon@hol.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2000 2:11:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;There are various just tunings for this latter sonority: 20:25:30:36;<br/>&gt;or 36:45:54:64; or 4:5:6:7.

Just a short remark, only to show<br/>everybody that I am a true defender of utonality. The utonal fine<br/>tuning of the above sonority is 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5. I would call<br/>that tuning &quot;just&quot;, though not in the sense of the 5-limit JI.</p><p>In an earlier message I replied to Joseph&apos;s comments but I forgot to<br/>ask him about Wolf&apos;es experiments -- any URL, files, ...? Please!</p><p>Best Regards,<br/>- George K.</p></div>
