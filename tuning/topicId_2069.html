A short attack-decay time gives enough<br/>ambiguity in &gt;the frequency (the uncertainty principle).</p><p>I don&apos;t think the continuous envelope is a problem (&quot;percussive organ&quot; has<br/>one).  But Erlich may be right in that fewer harmonics are better.  Try<br/>something more clarinet-like than a sawtooth.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Hmmm.  Try a 16:20:24:30:36, and then try 16:20:24:30:35.  Does the second<br/>&gt;&gt;chord sound like a mistuning of the first?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sort of. But shouldn&apos;t the second chord sound just as much like a mistuning<br/>&gt;of 16:20:24:30:34 (8:10:12:15:17)?</p><p>Well, :35 is less than 40 cents away from :36, and about 50 cents away from<br/>:34.  Also, the 17 adds more higher-limit intervals to the chord than the<br/>9, so the 9 should have a greater field of attraction.  But listening to<br/>chords, I&apos;d answer yes to your question.</p><p>Therefore, maybe I need something else to explain the sharpening I still<br/>hear when going from 20:25:35 to 20:24:35.</p><p>&gt;In this case the high note is flatter. I tried that too (with a piano<br/>tone), &gt;and I&apos;m willing to grant that maybe the :35 sounds more like the<br/>:36 than<br/>&gt;the :34. But it&apos;s subtle. They mostly just sound like 3 different chords<br/>to &gt;me, all fairly dissonant.</p><p>The 16:20:24:30:36 sounds dissonant?  Can you find a timbre where it doesn&apos;t?</p><p>&gt;[A long time ago Paul Erlich wrote:]<br/>&gt;The diminished seventh chord is tuned 10:12:14:17, and the dominant<br/>&gt;flat-9 is tuned 8:10:12:14:17, when performed by a barbershop quartet or<br/>&gt;other free-pitched ensemble.</p><p>In fact I sent Erlich a glaring example of the former chord &quot;my baby has<br/>gone away... so far awAY-AY-AY-AY&quot;.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=2076 href="#2076">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/1999 8:04:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What&apos;s an mp3?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The typical file extension for the third layer of the MPEG audio spec.<br/>&gt; Uses psychoacoustic masking to compress wav files as much as 1/10th their<br/>&gt; normal size without much loss in quality.
