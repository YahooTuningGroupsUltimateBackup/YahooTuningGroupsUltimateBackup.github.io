Strangely, this &quot;eighth&quot;,<br/>despite being tuned just like a 1/3-comma meantone fifth, was supposed to be<br/>a dissonance in his system, as his &quot;consonant&quot; hexad consisted of the<br/>&quot;root&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, &quot;fifth&quot;, &quot;seventh&quot;, &quot;ninth&quot;, and &quot;eleventh&quot; in his 12-note<br/>scale (a 2:1 would be a &quot;thirteenth&quot;).</p><p>In my 22-TET, it is the &quot;seventh&quot;, since my system is based on a decatonic<br/>scale. In my paper, I call the approximation of 3:2 in any tuning system a Q<br/>(for quint), and the term &quot;chain of Qs&quot; covers all these cases.</p><p>If you are familiar with Yasser but not me, I suggest you read my paper,<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>. Like Yasser, I look for<br/>the next scale after pentatonic and diatonic, but I am guided by a Partchian<br/>conception of harmony, though I maintain the concept that the basic<br/>consonant chords should be formed by a fixed pattern of degrees in the<br/>scale. 22-tET is not derived from numerology (as in Yasser&apos;s 7+12=19) but<br/>happens to be the tuning in which such a scale can be found.</p><p>Dave Keenan wrote,</p><p>&gt;Could be called the 22-tET region or the decatonic region or<br/>&gt;the Erlich region. Who was the earliest known proponent of 22-tET or<br/>&gt;tunings in general where 9 fifths is a major third?</p><p>Actually, if you want to call it the Erlich region, the major third is not<br/>defined as 9 fifths but as a half-octave minus two fifths. Graham Breed<br/>classifies 22 as diaschismic because 4 fourths is 2 major thirds (plus an<br/>octave). Bosanquet may have been the first to discuss (in a not unfavorable<br/>way) the relationship between Qs and Ts in 22-tET, but as far as I know, I<br/>was the first to notice how economically the approximations to complete<br/>7-limit harmonies come out in this system. I have searched the microtonal<br/>literature for any mention of my decatonic scales but they seem to have been<br/>missed. In fact, it is precisely as a result of that search that I became<br/>acquainted with the literature. Erv Wilson favorably considered all kinds of<br/>tunings, including some in the category in which 9 fifths is a major third.<br/>It is interesting how on page 5 of <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3.html</a>, he<br/>considers scales with 9, 11, 12, and 13 nominal symbols. 10 is left out.<br/>This is because it results not from a single chain of Qs, like the others,<br/>but from two interleaved ones.</p><p>&gt;If I were asked to determine the other limit of the Pythagorean region I&apos;d<br/>&gt;put it at 17-tET, 705.8c (also 34-tET). This is where the optimum 4:5 flips<br/>&gt;from -8 to +9 fifths.</p><p>Of course, 34-tET has a much better 4:5 than those constructed by fifths. So<br/>it doesn&apos;t really belong in this region, which I (and Graham Breed) would<br/>call &quot;schismic&quot; rather than Pythagorean. 34-tET is diaschismic.</p><p>&gt;So the known-world of chain-of-fifths tunings can be usefully divided into<br/>&gt;3 kingdoms:<br/>&gt;                   Chain-of-fifths<br/>&gt;                 /        |        \<br/>&gt;       | Meantone | Pythagorean | Erlichean? |<br/>&gt;     691.5c     700.0c        705.8c       711.8c   Borderline fifth size<br/>&gt;    59-tET*    12-tET        17-tET       59-tET    Borderline ETs<br/>&gt;11          4           -8            9          14 Fifths in a maj third</p><p>17-tET and 59-tET are not even borderline in the Erlichean kingdom since<br/>without the half-octave, you can&apos;t get the economical approximations I was<br/>talking about. Perhaps it would be better off without my name.</p></div><h3><a id=2528 href="#2528">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/1999 10:44:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If my understanding is correct, Erv Wilson used the term &quot;linear<br/>&gt;temperament&quot; for the &quot;chain-of-identical-fifths&quot; idea.

He says that in order to show the full implications of what the<br/>Bosanquet keyboard it would have required volumes that never would be<br/>published. He sees these keyboard as a palette in which the composer is free to<br/>fill in his own way. <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal21.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal21.html</a>  on the bottom of fig<br/>24 shows the template where the 3 is +1,9 +2, the 7 +10 and the 11 +18 in a<br/>linear temperament of fifths.  Since a &quot;linear<br/>temperament&quot; of a &quot;chain-of-identical-fifths&quot; is included in his use of the<br/>term you are using the term correctly and can still say what you want to say. I<br/>expect that this might cause more questions that answers and will do my best to<br/>answer, but please realize that Erv at this time cannot answer question through<br/>me.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
