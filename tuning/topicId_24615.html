The<br/>presi...i mean the vice-president has informed me that many of you today, are here from other<br/>countries. More and more of America&apos;s immigrant&apos;s and foriegn tourists, are coming from other<br/>countries. I understand that some of you are from Canadia. Canadia is one of our biggest neighbors<br/>to the north, and we welcome you with the kind of circumspect you deserve. We have a lot of<br/>circumspect for people of this fine state, i mean country. As a child, my daddy once told me,<br/>&quot;Dub-ya, your making such a racket with your singing, you best shut that hole fore&apos;s i come over<br/>and uh bu-rake it&quot;. So i don&apos;t know, maybe i could be a good microtonanal singer&quot;.</p><p>(a burst of laughter from both listeners as the President left the podium)</p></div>
