She can tolerate most of the rest of<br/>our taste, but is decidedly uncertain about Xenakis and some of the<br/>other electoacoustics.  She likes one of my pieces which had a lot of<br/>high freqiency sounds -- unfortunately I did not and junked it.</p><p>On the other hand I have not noticed any consonance/dissonance<br/>preferences; perhaps I will watch more carefully.</p><p>==John ff&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Sarn says:</p><p>We must make ABSOLUTELY SURE that it isn&apos;t the absolute pitch of the<br/>music, and rather the MUSICAL INTERVALS.</p><p>Try this:</p><p>1.Take a selection of music.<br/>2.Up sample it.<br/>3.Time stretch it.<br/><a href="http://4.Play">4.Play</a> the cat a selection.</p><p>--Cats have a higher hearing range, thus the need for sampleing,<br/>but since this shortens the music,<br/>we&apos;d need to time stretch.</p><p>Do let me know how you get on!!</p><p>Sarn.</p></div>
