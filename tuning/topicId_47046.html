Idiophones almost the same, minus a consistent spectrum and the much less direct physical experience and therefore probably with much effects. Plucked string instruments can produce harmonics; here there&apos;s something to count and the obvious tuning is pythagorean. A monochord collection like the piano needs to be economical with regard to number of tones/time used for retunings (and cost, and playability) and leans toward temperaments.</p><p>The physical aspect affects things like ease of production and sustain, but there is music to be made with any pitch collection. I believe that music is tuned up mainly for consistency&apos;s sake, but there are still different ways to tune that are more or less natural for a particular instrument.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=47293 href="#47293">ðŸ”—</a>Martin Braun &#x3C;nombraun@telia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2003 9:09:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; the horizontal thirds found in world musics show no<br/>&gt; attraction to ratios of 5. we have seconds in horizontal music and<br/>&gt; thirds can be built up from seconds. do the seconds have a<br/>derivation<br/>&gt; in ratios? no, and neither do the horizonatal thirds.</p><p>Paul, do you have evidence for this?
