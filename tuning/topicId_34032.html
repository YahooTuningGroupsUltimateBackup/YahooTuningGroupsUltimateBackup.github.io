(I chuckled out loud on this one.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; After noting the discussion on the list regarding notation to<br/>&gt; reflect tuning practice, a few questions come to mind. Is the idea<br/>&gt; here to suggest to the performer to lower or raise certain<br/>&gt; pitches &quot;on the fly&quot;? Okay, so far. But then lower or raise *how*<br/>&gt; far? Would that be a matter of education? Or is the idea to move the<br/>&gt; pitch toward &quot;best&quot; tuning--i.e., small-number ratio--which likely<br/>&gt; can be &apos;heard&apos; acoustically?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****Hi Jerry!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for your post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All my pieces nowadays come with an *audio CD.*  On this CD is *Ear<br/>&gt; Training.*</p><p>Got to hear it! Where do I buy?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Basically, I have the performer compare 12-tET pitches with &quot;altered&quot;<br/>&gt; Blackjack pitches with only *three* alterations available using 72-<br/>&gt; tET notation, which is what I now use:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/12 whole tone deviation up and down<br/>&gt; 1/6 whole tone deviation up and down<br/>&gt; 1/4 whole tone deviation up and down<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12-tET players are pretty much used to 1/4-tone playing these days,<br/>&gt; as Johnny Reinhard mentioned, so this is not so much of a problem.</p><p>Really? By this, do you (and Johnny) mean that players *consciously* adjust<br/>exactly to 1/4-tones? Or to something in the vicinity? As you know, I<br/>realize that pitch-sensitive players adjust pitches to suit their<br/>&quot;instincts&quot; but I&apos;m not sure they are shooting for a specific mark other<br/>than &quot;best&quot; tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For learning the other &quot;alterations&quot; I use the method advocated by<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 1/12 whole tone alteration (16 cents) is practiced by playing a<br/>&gt; drone unison note and starting with a tempered 12-tET major third and<br/>&gt; then lowering it until it stops beating (syntonic comma).</p><p>Love it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 1/6 whole tone alteration (33 cents) is practiced by playing a<br/>&gt; minor 7th against a drone pitch and then lowering it until it stops<br/>&gt; beating (septimal comma).</p><p>Ditto.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, in addition to matching the &quot;ear training&quot; alterations on the CD,<br/>&gt; the players can practice by stopping the beating of these 12-tET<br/>&gt; tempered intervals *acoustically* in the way that you mention.</p><p>Very interesting. I can&apos;t wait to hear the CDs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In addition, I *then* have yet *another* track that plays the entire<br/>&gt; Blackjack scale through the audible range of the instrument ascending<br/>&gt; and descending for practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FINALLY, I have a track that is, essentially, a *music minus one*<br/>&gt; track, that has the electronic piece *PLUS* the instrumental part in<br/>&gt; the correct tuning in MIDI for the player to play along with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The *last* track on the &quot;trainer&quot; CD is the actual piece to be played<br/>&gt; in concert *WITHOUT* the solo instrumental part which will,<br/>&gt; hopefully... :) be performed by the player.</p><p>Shall I get out my old clarinet, or maybe I&apos;ll just try to vocalize it. I<br/>still have a pretty good falsetto.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe I&apos;m pretty much going to stick with this format for all the<br/>&gt; instruments I work with, except for the fact that I will have to have<br/>&gt; extensive and *accurate* fingering charts when I get to woodwinds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Guess which woodwind I will do first??  (Well, Johnny Reinhard *has*<br/>&gt; promised me the fingerings!)</p><p>Well, don&apos;t count on me for the clarinet fingerings. I quit playing long<br/>before I realized there were more than 12 pitches per octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the time being, I am concentrating on *solo* instrumental pieces<br/>&gt; with electronics.  I have *plenty* of larger pieces in my oeuvre, and<br/>&gt; it seems that this is the most *practical* and best way,<br/>&gt; educationally, to get new players to understand and want to play<br/>&gt; these new tunings.  And I can also work with the player *directly* as<br/>&gt; necessary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s whatssup...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>Thanks for the very clear overview, Joseph. Good luck with this. I think it<br/>will make a fine contribution toward opening eyes (and ears) among musicians<br/>and music educators.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3><a id=34043 href="#34043">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2002 6:32:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/10/02 6:13 AM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 9<br/>&gt;  Date: Sat, 09 Feb 2002 22:15:52 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: consensus in notation<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even though I didn&apos;t *want* to, I changed ALL my charts, graphs,<br/>&gt; lattices, information, etc., etc., etc. to the new Blackjack key of G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe</p><p>Perhaps you can clarify something for me that has been bothering me since<br/>reading about Blackjack.

Note that his book takes a much more JI approach to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; what music and musicians do, even implying the use of 11 and 13<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; limit entities in the performance of &quot;in tune&quot; Western music. Since<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; this doesn&apos;t match at all what I hear, I have some scepticism about<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; theorizing he may make, regardless of the quality of his choral<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; directing.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Me:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I join you in that skepticism, Bob. I learned a lot during my months on the<br/>&gt;&gt; list. Too bad I can&apos;t go back and modify all the copies of my books. At<br/>&gt;&gt; least I&apos;ll be a bit more cautious in any future writing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Jerry,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You left for a round of golf about a year and half ago and here you<br/>&gt; are. Sounds about like my game...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding whatever skepticism we may have now, I probably would have said the<br/>&gt; same things (or attempted to say something like it) as in your book, regarding<br/>&gt; tuning. A lot of my thoughts have been challenged and changed since joining<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; list and to your credit, you did get a lot of &quot;message&quot; out there to the<br/>&gt; musical<br/>&gt; masses who think that the number 12 is the basis for all of music past,<br/>&gt; present<br/>&gt; and future.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meanwhile, regarding the high third, it may well be that there is no pure<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic-physiological basis for a specific frequency or ratio. If we<br/>&gt; accept that, then one could start to conject the same for the variety of<br/>&gt; neutral intervals in Arabic/Turkish/Persian musics (despite their theorists)<br/>&gt; as well as &quot;blue notes&quot;. Maybe people just choose the note that sounds good,<br/>&gt; given SOME amount of psychoacoustic-physiological and many helpings of<br/>&gt; cultural<br/>&gt; &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice to read your voice again,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine</p><p>Thanks, Bob. Nice to be back.</p><p>I&apos;m quite convinced that the ethnic characteristics you mention should in<br/>fact be considered deviations from acoustic &quot;standards.&quot; The same could be<br/>said of Pablo Casals&apos; &quot;urgent&quot; leading tones (which I believe approximate<br/>&quot;my&quot; high third.</p><p>That thought reminds me of the discussion here of the G-Bv-D triad. While<br/>there is no doubt that the JI third is acoustically consonant, I find that<br/>even novice group singers, once made sensitive to flexible tuning, go for<br/>the &quot;deviation.&quot; Oh, well!</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3><a id=34058 href="#34058">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2002 8:24:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_34032.html#34032">/tuning/topicId_34032.html#34032</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; ****Hi Jerry!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your post.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All my pieces nowadays come with an *audio CD.*  On this CD is<br/>*Ear<br/>&gt; &gt; Training.*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Got to hear it!
