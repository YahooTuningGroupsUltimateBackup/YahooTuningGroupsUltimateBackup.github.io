LISP had stopped working on our system, but I<br/>fixed that.  And, most importantly, I put in a random-seeder,<br/>(previously, every melody it generated was exactly the same in terms of<br/>contour and rhythm(!)).  So it should be working fine now.</p><p>Also, as per Paul Erlich&apos;s request, there are now 9 entry spots for scale<br/>tones.  (for 10 note scales).  Though, personally, I think it&apos;s more<br/>interesting with smaller scales  (because the thing generates trees of<br/>neighbor notes, using random fragments of the original scale; with<br/>smaller scales, the deriviation of the neighbors from the original is more<br/>audible. Unless of course you&apos;re using something symmetrical like an<br/>octatonic or hyperMOS etc.)</p><p>I&apos;m still planning an update:  I&apos;d like to get some more interesting<br/>timbre than that dinky guitar physical model;  and I&apos;ll probably let the<br/>trees of neighbor-tones get even deeper.</p><p>Also, someone suggested that I have the thing noodle around in the<br/>original scale for awhile before jumping into the trees.  An excellent<br/>idea.  I got it to sort of do that now, but I&apos;d like to have it play an<br/>actual intro in the given scale before moving on.</p><p>So . . . .if anyone&apos;s bored,</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/lsys.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/lsys.html</a></p><p>If it @#$%@#$ up, tell me.</p><p>Thanks,  CB</p></div>
