It is presumed that the &quot;posting&quot; of such ideas<br/>(as opposed to the private communication of such ideas) would be<br/>intended to serve a purpose beyond the private gratification that a<br/>large majority of the audience will (by design) remain &quot;befuddled&quot;.</p><p>Please note that, while I am &quot;befuddled&quot; (though impressed) with a<br/>great majority of your own posts, I have never gotten the impression<br/>from your statements that any such obscurifications have/are intended.</p><p>Best Regards,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=30301 href="#30301">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2001 5:31:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;J Gill&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; While my own intellectual capacities are limited, I have<br/>&gt; sincerely attempted to communicate in a manner which attempts to<br/>&gt; elucidate, rather than obscure, the definitions of what it is that<br/>I<br/>&gt; have spoken of in my posts.</p><p>And you&apos;re saying that I try to obscure the definitions.</p><p>&gt; This seems essential for substantive<br/>&gt; communications to take place, and seems to be a reasonable<br/>&gt; expectation in the course of spending one&apos;s time and energy<br/>&gt; interacting with others concerning subjects (established or new).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is not the inevitable give-and-take of such intellectual<br/>discourse<br/>&gt; which concerns me, but the sincerity with which those engaged in<br/>such<br/>&gt; discourse (yourself not included) proceed, where it comes to<br/>&gt; specifying (rather than evading) the specific details and<br/>definitions<br/>&gt; involved which would serve to allow other persons viewing such<br/>public<br/>&gt; posts to, with such knowledge in hand, actually attempt to<br/>contribute<br/>&gt; to the discussion(s).</p><p>And you&apos;re implying that I&apos;m insincere and evasive.</p><p>&gt; It is presumed that the &quot;posting&quot; of such ideas<br/>&gt; (as opposed to the private communication of such ideas) would be<br/>&gt; intended to serve a purpose beyond the private gratification that a<br/>&gt; large majority of the audience will (by design) remain &quot;befuddled&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t even want to think about what you&apos;re implying here.</p><p>&gt; Please note that, while I am &quot;befuddled&quot; (though impressed) with a<br/>&gt; great majority of your own posts, I have never gotten the<br/>impression<br/>&gt; from your statements that any such obscurifications have/are<br/>intended.</p><p>But from me you do.</p><p>Look, J, I&apos;m sorry that I tend to try to compress a lot of<br/>information into very short posts.

And I will do this for _anyone_ on this<br/>list. That&apos;s a promise. The things you&apos;re implying about me are<br/>simply untrue, and you&apos;re certainly the cause of &quot;de-obfuscation&quot; by<br/>casting these aspersions my way (I wouldn&apos;t want to ask this &quot;paul&quot;<br/>guy any questions after reading what you wrote).
