The only thing I would<br/>like to draw attention to is the first couple of pictures,  which detail the<br/>system.</p><p>There is an age old problem between relative and fixed Solfa.</p><p> I have created a system of 12  consonant phonemes  to represent the 12<br/>physical pitch classes present on a piano keyboard,  and 12 vowel phonemes<br/>to represent position relative to root.</p><p>this creates a grid of 144 possible &apos;tonemes&apos;</p><p> if I just dump an example from the wiki</p><p>*Examples*<br/>SuperTonic in the key of G major (actual note: A)<br/>The physical note is A, so the consonant Toneme is &apos;L&apos;<br/>as it is the super tonic, the vowel Toneme is &apos;E&apos; As in &apos;bear&apos;<br/>so &apos;LE&apos; as in &apos;lair&apos;</p><p>A generic major scale:<br/>sA fE si fO su f3 sI fA</p><p>a generic minor scale:<br/>sA fE sEi fO su f3i sI fA</p><p>a generic scale I just made up:<br/>sA fAi si fO su f3i sI fA</p><p>a C Major Scale:<br/>dA rE mi vO zu l3 tI dA</p><p>C# Minor Scale:<br/>bA ngE vEi shO hu l3i dI bA</p><p> intuitively I feel that such a system could be very helpful for<br/>conceptualising musical theory  without making it too &apos; theoretical &apos;.<br/> seeing as 12 tone equal temperament does a pretty good job of representing<br/>all of the music I like,  my intuition is that a system such as this could<br/>be used,  and  pitch adjustments be made on the fly.</p><p> so for example each of the above scales could be sung in just intonation</p><p> I think this is much more appealing than using terms such as F#, Gb</p><p> also it&apos;s worth noting that the same toneme would represent both F# and Gb.<br/>  however, since you would be aware of which direction around the wheel you<br/>are modulating, you would know the difference.</p><p> I have also matched a colour scheme.   I think colour is very useful,<br/>especially for the simple reason that it connects to our brains biggest IO<br/>port; a 2D matrix of receptors connecting into neural circuitry that can<br/>instantaneously process patterns. I think this should really be taken<br/>advantage of.</p><p>  I am currently porting it to the iPhone/iPad.   I enclose a screenshot of<br/>the current state of the work.   As you rotate the disc,  the labels change<br/>to reflect the new key.   also they dynamically resize to illustrate the<br/>position within the key. The model I am working on allows you to sing a<br/>tone,  and spins the needle to point to its toneme.   also pressing the<br/>buttons will sound the relevant toneme, although I haven&apos;t  wired that in<br/>yet.   I was considering using Shepard Tones,  which would get rid of the<br/>difficulty of voicing chords,  so I could just sound three simultaneously<br/>and get a tonic Triad. But now I&apos;m a little unsure of how to proceed in<br/>light of the huge amount of new information I have expose myself to over the<br/>last week.</p><p> I have to say that when I started out I thought I knew everything, and now<br/>I don&apos;t feel like I know anything. However, my musical ability does seem to<br/>be picking up, I am becoming able to figure out the chords for songs on<br/>guitar,   I am developing some basic ability to intuit bass notes in<br/>response to a melody.</p><p> any guidance from the elders of the group would be very welcome!</p><p> please, if you can see I am going up a dead end, save my fingers and point<br/>it out to me.    also if I am ( literally )  reinventing the wheel, please<br/>tell me!</p><p> and thirdly, if you can point out any intelligent direction for me to work<br/>in, I would be super grateful.   This line of work isn&apos;t going to make me<br/>rich I don&apos;t think, but there are probably enough iPhone users who are keen<br/>musicians to keep me alive.   I would love to serve the musical community,<br/>as I am a member of this community.  I have invested several months getting<br/>down and dirty with the iPhone audio and graphics frameworks,  so please<br/>feel free to consider me as a resource :)</p><p> so, overall, does this system hold water?</p><p>Pi</p></div>
