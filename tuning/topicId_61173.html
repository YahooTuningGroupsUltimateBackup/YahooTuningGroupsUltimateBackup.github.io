I do find &quot;mode&quot; useful as a<br/>general term to talk about specific modal traditions like Gregorian<br/>chant, ragas, of maqams. When you happen to walk by a New Grove, try<br/>looking at the mode article there. You&apos;ll be surprised how many<br/>traditions, possibilities of rules, ... and pages there are.</p><p>[oz]<br/>I have given the definition from the Harvard&apos;s some months ago, did I not?<br/>The definition for the mode extends well beyond the conventional usage these<br/>days, because you and others want to infer things from it that is not<br/>necessarily contained within it. Specifically, you assume mode can be<br/>converted to any &quot;tonality&quot;.</p><p>  Mode is only the<br/>&gt; changing of the tonic in a given economical scale,</p><p>[ks]<br/>No, it&apos;s not. The popular terms for the rotations of the white note<br/>scale are derived from Henricus Glarean&apos;s Dodekachordon, which treated<br/>12 modes, two each on C, D, E, F, G, and A. The two kinds were<br/>authentic and plagal, with their finals at the bottom of the compass<br/>or in the middle. The modes on C and A were Glarean&apos;s invention,<br/>acknowledging what would become the Major and Minor modes of Western<br/>music (he included the B modes for completeness&apos; sake, but called them<br/>unusable for their lacking fifth/fourth). The modes on D, E, F, and G<br/>had their own traditional melodic turns, finals and recitation tones<br/>(sometimes called &quot;dominants&quot;).</p><p>[oz]<br/>And just because the tonic was given a singular variance with plagal modes<br/>invented a thousand years after Greeks, you expect me to agree that the<br/>Maqamat are the same as the modes which do not even alterate?</p><p>[ks]<br/>The current popular use of Glarean&apos;s mode names is probably due to<br/>Joseph Schillinger, who suggested &quot;transposition by modes&quot; to<br/>introduce variation or to arrive at new ideas.</p><p>[oz]<br/>So you said previously some months ago.</p><p>[ks]<br/>Note that he would use the interval structure of one mode with melodies that<br/>owed their existence to the melodic rules of a different one. Schillinger&apos;s<br/>teachings are the grounds on which the BerkLee College was built, and<br/>from there it obviously spread throughout the world.</p><p>[oz]<br/>Excuse me, maybe I&apos;m out of this world, but I do not agree with Mr.<br/>Schillinger&apos;s expanded conceptions on mode. Maqams are not modes, period. It<br/>is an ugly prejudice, an amateurish misconception to assume that the term<br/>mode can be stretched so far as to embrace the highly complicated tonal<br/>structure of Maqams, which can modulate, transpose, alterate, pitch-bend at<br/>whim.</p><p>[ks]<br/>The popular notion of Dorian, Myxolydian, Ionian derives from playing around<br/>with, perverting, if you want, modes on a superficial level, but modes are a<br/>far richer concept.</p><p>[oz]<br/>So you want to make us believe. Fortunately, I am very sceptical concerning<br/>your claims. Are there any solid examples that demonstrate Maqam-like<br/>behaviour in modal compositions?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Key, on the other hand, is not bound up exclusively in Western<br/>&gt; practive as you assume, because there is an inherent harmony as<br/>&gt; implied by the usage of a particular Maqam. This clandestine<br/>&gt; harmony exists in the Ney, Kemencha, Tanbur, Oud, and even the<br/>&gt; Qudum (bowl sized timpani made from animal skin). For sure, tonics<br/>&gt; and dominants exist in the Maqamat. It&apos;s just that they are not<br/>&gt; always a pure fifth apart!</p><p>[ks]<br/>Then they are modal recitation tones, not the dominants of functional<br/>harmony.</p><p>[oz]<br/>There are indeed dominants of functional harmony, but not the functional<br/>harmony you imply which seems to be monopolized by the West!</p><p>&gt; You assume that a key with many accidentals should modulate to keys<br/>&gt; with more accidentals in Classical sonatas?</p><p>[ks]<br/>I said the opposite, that a piece in a key with many sharps may have a<br/>tendency to modulate into keys with less sharps rather than advancing<br/>towards the double sharps. This was my attempt to make a key determine<br/>the fate of the music; it has nothing to do with what I think.</p><p>[oz]<br/>Exactly. the key determines the fate, or the SEYIR of the music. The mode<br/>does not. It is simply the changing of the tonic, or the final note with the<br/>Plagals. This by itself is not enough to define the Maqamat.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is equally easy to modulate in both directions, and I see this<br/>&gt; done in many pieces from the Classical and Baroque eras. So, a key<br/>&gt; does not specify an exact direction, it merely includes the element<br/>&gt; of direction, modulation, transposition, alteration, etc... Also,<br/>&gt; you neglect the role of tonics an octave apart since your ear is<br/>&gt; conditioned by &grave;octave equivalance&grave;. In the world of Maqamat, the<br/>&gt; pitches of the fundamental gamut are classified all the way up<br/>&gt; three octaves from Kaba Rast to Tiz Gerdaniye, and these are all<br/>&gt; relative frequencies with Rast at 1/1 and they are all produced<br/>&gt; from the Ney! It does matter at which relative frequency one comes<br/>&gt; to rest in Maqam Music, even when (tempered) octaves of a piano<br/>&gt; register the same to Western ears. You overlook the fact that a<br/>&gt; Maqam cannot be called a scale or mode for that very reason.</p><p>[ks]<br/>No, it can&apos;t be called a key, because the key of C ends on a C - any<br/>C. Call it a mode, and the necessary question about what defines this<br/>mode will have to follow.</p><p>[oz]<br/>Exactly. the Key of Segah must end on perde Segah, not elsewhere. It is not<br/>a mode, especially a Plagal one!</p><p>  Notice<br/>&gt; the concept &grave;Key of C Major&grave;. Likewise take note of the concept<br/>&gt; &grave;Key of Huzzam&grave;.</p><p>[ks]<br/>But with a grain of salt: the Major mode and the Huzzam mode.</p><p>[oz]<br/>Then, pray tell me how this Huzzam mode of yours will progress in a piece.<br/>Better yet, why don&apos;t you try to compose a piece in your Huzzam mode and let<br/>me judge if it sounds like Maqam Music?</p><p>Their tonal resources are entirely different and<br/>&gt; there is no implication of octave equivalance with Huzzam, while<br/>&gt; there indeed IS with C Major.</p><p>[ks]<br/>Because their modal systems are concerned with different things.</p><p>[oz]<br/>George Secor at least shows the decency to admit that his experiments with a<br/>17-note temperament, although evidently containing pitches from Maqam<br/>Huseini, do not necessarily imply Maqam Music at all. And you claim that you<br/>can compose a Huzzam peshrev with the limited information contained in a<br/>measly mode? Go ahead then, let us see what you can produce.</p><p>  C Major must end with C no matter<br/>&gt; where it may be, a composition in Huzzam must end with perde Segah<br/>&gt; (hence, 3rd place/diatonical degree in Persian), and it is only to<br/>&gt; be found at 27/22 to 5/4 from Rast, whose absolute frequency<br/>&gt; changes with the Ahenk (diapason).</p><p>[ks]<br/>But the rules for the Major mode are the same from the key of Dbb to<br/>B#, just as you can adjust the pitch of a makam to the range of the<br/>singer and the music.</p><p>[oz]<br/>Exactly. Rast is a Rast even when sung in Sipurde, Mustahsen, Kiz, Mansur or<br/>Shah. The rules of key (hence, tonality) do not change, because only the<br/>diapason changes.</p><p>  As for mode, a scale starting on<br/>&gt; the 8th degree is not different from a scale starting on the 1st<br/>&gt; degree of a diatonical scale, hence the term &grave;mode&grave; makes no<br/>&gt; distinction between these.<br/>&gt;</p><p>[ks]<br/>I noticed that my dictionary gives &quot;makam&quot; as the only translation of<br/>Tonart (key), whereas Tongeschlecht (the major-minor distinction)<br/>doesn&apos;t even appear.</p><p>[oz]<br/>For once, a German source speaks the truth. And that without any references<br/>to Western tonality!</p><p>[ks]<br/>My immediate reaction is to blame the translation<br/>on someone like Hindemith or rather Donizetti who appropriated the<br/>next available Turkish term to teach them Turks some real music - it<br/>certainly doesn&apos;t fit the matter.</p><p>[oz]<br/>I almost detect the supremasist racism of Nazi Germany by some<br/>Aryan-minded protagonist.

However, the Easterners possess only the Ut of<br/>this octave and their instruments do not contain any lower pitch other than<br/>Re. The only exception to this is the violin. In this instrument, which is<br/>the same as ours, the Ut of the lowest string is named Chargah just like the<br/>one an octave above it. All the other perde names change according to the<br/>octave. Hence, the first Re (Yegah) is named Neva in the second octave, and<br/>Ashiran, Huseyni. Thus the pitches are these:</p><p>Yegah, Re-D<br/>Ashiran, Mi-E<br/>Araq, Fa-F (should have been F#)<br/>Rast, Sol-G<br/>Dugah, La-A<br/>Segah, Si-B<br/>Chargah, Ut-C<br/>Neva, Re-D<br/>Huseyni, Mi-E<br/>Evdj, Fa-F (should have been F#)<br/>Gerdaniye, Sol-G<br/>Muhayyer, La-A<br/>Tiz Segah, Si-B<br/>Tiz Chargah, Ut-C<br/>Tiz Neva, Re-D<br/>Tiz Huseyni, Mi-E<br/>Tiz Evdj, Fa-F (should have been F#)</p><p>Besides these whole (natural) tones, there are semitones which Easterners<br/>call &quot;nim&quot;. Nim means half in Persian. This word is used in a general way<br/>for both the sharps and flats. However, these too acquire special names<br/>depending on which register they may be found. Their convention is like the<br/>convention of pitches which acquire new names according to their octave<br/>level. It is highly strange that Eastern Music has more pitches than ours.<br/>In order to ascertain the reality of this incredible situation, it is<br/>sufficient to analyze the instrument which they call the Tanbur....</p><p>There are 2 nim perdes between Ashiran and Araq, and again 2 between Araq<br/>and Rast. This goes on like this up to Huseyni. Above Huseyni, there are<br/>only a single nim between...</p><p>Yet those more refined in Oriental Music will say that there is an equal<br/>amount of nim tones in each octave, but that some of these are not used in<br/>any of the aires and thus are not placed on the tanbur.</p><p>Aside from these irregularities, the Easterners, as we said previously,<br/>possess more half-tones than us.

However, the Easterners possess only the Ut<br/>of<br/>&gt; this octave and their instruments do not contain any lower pitch other<br/>than<br/>&gt; Re. The only exception to this is the violin. In this instrument, which is<br/>&gt; the same as ours, the Ut of the lowest string is named Chargah just like<br/>the<br/>&gt; one an octave above it. All the other perde names change according to the<br/>&gt; octave. Hence, the first Re (Yegah) is named Neva in the second octave,<br/>and<br/>&gt; Ashiran, Huseyni. Thus the pitches are these:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yegah, Re-D<br/>&gt; Ashiran, Mi-E<br/>&gt; Araq, Fa-F (should have been F#)<br/>&gt; Rast, Sol-G<br/>&gt; Dugah, La-A<br/>&gt; Segah, Si-B<br/>&gt; Chargah, Ut-C<br/>&gt; Neva, Re-D<br/>&gt; Huseyni, Mi-E<br/>&gt; Evdj, Fa-F (should have been F#)<br/>&gt; Gerdaniye, Sol-G<br/>&gt; Muhayyer, La-A<br/>&gt; Tiz Segah, Si-B<br/>&gt; Tiz Chargah, Ut-C<br/>&gt; Tiz Neva, Re-D<br/>&gt; Tiz Huseyni, Mi-E<br/>&gt; Tiz Evdj, Fa-F (should have been F#)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Besides these whole (natural) tones, there are semitones which Easterners<br/>&gt; call &quot;nim&quot;. Nim means half in Persian. This word is used in a general way<br/>&gt; for both the sharps and flats. However, these too acquire special names<br/>&gt; depending on which register they may be found. Their convention is like<br/>the<br/>&gt; convention of pitches which acquire new names according to their octave<br/>&gt; level. It is highly strange that Eastern Music has more pitches than ours.<br/>&gt; In order to ascertain the reality of this incredible situation, it is<br/>&gt; sufficient to analyze the instrument which they call the Tanbur....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are 2 nim perdes between Ashiran and Araq, and again 2 between Araq<br/>&gt; and Rast. This goes on like this up to Huseyni. Above Huseyni, there are<br/>&gt; only a single nim between...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet those more refined in Oriental Music will say that there is an equal<br/>&gt; amount of nim tones in each octave, but that some of these are not used in<br/>&gt; any of the aires and thus are not placed on the tanbur.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aside from these irregularities, the Easterners, as we said previously,<br/>&gt; possess more half-tones than us.

A mode has never been a skeletal framework (except perhaps<br/>for theorists).  To any musician, a mode would have a scale and certain prominent notes as its skeleton, but would also encompass much more - particular feelings and moods, specific rhythmic and melodic patterns, ornaments, occasions for use and so on.  I doubt that &quot;mode&quot; was ever a truly analytic concept, even in Europe, until  after the decline of Romanticism ...</p><p>-------------</p><p>Obviously, we think different things on mode.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... a Maqam,<br/>&gt; &gt; since at least five-to-six centuries, cannot be conceived seperately<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; its respective Seyir, by which highly tonal melodies are constructed.</p><p>Ozan, could you please enlighten us a little on Seyir, perhaps by use of an example?</p><p>----------------</p><p>The Seyir, or the flow of the melody is dependant on the scale(s) a Maqam uses. For example, the Rast Maqam whose scale proper is Harmonic Major can sometimes travel to Usshaq, Huseini, Segah and even more remote keys such as Saba, Nihawend, Kurdi, etc... This phenomenon is not researched very well I&apos;m afraid. You should listen to the examples here:</p><p><a href="http://www.zeryab.com/Updates.htm">http://www.zeryab.com/Updates.htm</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; Thusly, a Maqam is synonymous with Key, or Tonality.</p><p>I would hope that a Turkish maqam was more than this.

Indeed, in such condescending terms, a Turkish Maqam is &quot;just a European key with a funny tuning&quot;.</p><p>----------------</p><p>And of course, an Arabic maqam is not at all synonymous with either Key or Tonality; it still retains much more of its ancient modal spirit.  (Even when it is accompanied by the most dreadfully syrupy western string ensemble to make music for soap-operas in Cairo.)</p><p>--------------</p><p>Talk about musical supremacism!

There is nothing inherently bad, by the way, about transposing modes as far as voice and instruments allow. Naming a key, however, consists of a pitch designation in addition to the mode name.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I only know that functional harmony developed in the West, and it<br/>&gt; developed out of polyphonic music. Many melodies can take a<br/>&gt; harmonization built on cadences later, but this is not the way they<br/>&gt; were composed.<br/>&gt; &gt; -------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps Margo Schulter&apos;s &grave;focality&grave; deserves more mention.</p><p>I found one usenet post where she uses that term, and there she describes the usual cadences in 3-part music. The octaves or unisons derive from the stepwise approach to &quot;structure notes&quot; in a given melody. They come from the mode.</p><p>OK, now I see it. Above, I used &quot;cadence&quot; in the functional harmonic sense, as in V-I. This is about melodic cadences that early polyphony took over from the modes. You approach a (e.g. Dorian) finalis by steps; if the tenor goes E-D, the cantus goes C(#)-D. A third part has to end in A. Counterpoint allows A or G as the note before (depending on context, since A is dissonace when E is in the bass and has to be introduced properly). But with A, the third part would also not partake in the cadence, so it&apos;s G. And if the C is sharp, so is the G. In melodic terms, this is a double approach to D. In harmonic terms, it would be C# minor-D without a third, but implied minor. So in modern, functional terms, this is no cadence at all. Functional harmony would have opted for the A and solved the dissonant fourth problem by putting the A in the bass. This solution was only possible when a fourth, bass, part was introduced in the 15th century.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So did Carl Lumma, and you agreed wholeheartedly about the last<br/>&gt; sentence from his pos that sai that maqams and rags belong to one<br/>&gt; modal system.<br/>&gt; &gt; ------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; Where?

Actually, this makes it something of a challenge and even more intriguing to me.</p><p>Firstly it is not sure whether an ordinary listener was able to experience the ethos of a plainsong - people possible took their mood cues mostly from the rhythm (as they probably do today) - the notational system was ready for it. (Caveat: lugubrious, &quot;dark&quot; music was music that used many &quot;black&quot; notes, so was lively according to our understanding).</p><p>Granted this, it may not be possible to tell when some voices in a four part texture leave their ordinary compass and switch from plagal to authentic for half a phrase. Other things like a cadence on an unusual tone are easier to hear.</p><p>It also implies that diatonic music could be highly expressive (the opposite of what is generally said about Palestrina). So why did monody appear in the opera from 1600 on? And where do we put Gesualdo and others, who used chromaticism (microtonality! back on topic!) for expressive purposes?</p><p>klaus</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of my professors was of the minority opinion that the full modal &gt; system (the octoechos) was still in use during the high renaissance &gt; whereas even contemporary sources were speaking of modi commixti &gt; (fusions of the authentic and plagal modes) in polyphony. If tenor and &gt; cantus were authentic, said he, altus and bassus were plagal and vice &gt; versa. The finales could not be relied on, of course, since this music &gt; uses triads. Any other deviations from the modes as they should be &gt; were ascribed to modulations; there was usually some reason in the &gt; text to adapt the ethos and thus the mode of the music, and the &gt; so-called mixture of modes was really an intentional expressive &gt; device. I find this intriguing, but I don&apos;t know the music well enough &gt; to have my own opinion about its truth. Anyway, he stood more or less &gt; alone against the scientific community claiming that melodies built &gt; from modal principles could and have been used in polyphonic music.<br/>&gt; &gt; You can write a canon and only think about harmony. But the result &gt; will most likely be arpeggiatied triads that outline a cadence and not &gt; a melody with its own strong sense of direction.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; klaus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;</p></div><h3><a id=61472 href="#61472">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2005 8:24:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan,</p><p>On Fri, 14 Oct 2005, you wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear brother Yahya,<br/>&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt;   From: Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>&gt;   To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;   Sent: 12 Ekim 2005 &iuml;&iquest;&half;ar&iuml;&iquest;&half;amba 4:48<br/>&gt;   Subject: [tuning] Re: Keys and modes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Well, I&apos;m impressed!

The repertory was<br/>  there before they applied Greek theory to it.</p><p>I shall take a look at this Grove definition on mode at my earliest leisure.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; How about tonal center, or tone-of-origin then?</p><p>  &quot;Lower end of the range&quot; seems to be what they mean.</p><p>It certainly won&apos;t hold then, as the register of a mode is well beyond what is conceived in theory.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; And I said they are akin to keys more than they can be defined as modes,<br/>  &gt; simply because all the modes utilize just one diatonical scale, while the<br/>  &gt; Maqamat utilize many scales.</p><p>  This is the very reason why I would call them modes. There is nothing<br/>  inherently bad, by the way, about transposing modes as far as voice<br/>  and instruments allow. Naming a key, however, consists of a pitch<br/>  designation in addition to the mode name.</p><p>Exactly. You need a pitch designation so that you can safely modulate to Segah from Huzzam without a change in key. Besides, mode is a fundamental ingredient of key, not vice versa.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Perhaps Margo Schulter&apos;s &grave;focality&grave; deserves more mention.</p><p>  I found one usenet post where she uses that term, and there she<br/>  describes the usual cadences in 3-part music. The octaves or unisons<br/>  derive from the stepwise approach to &quot;structure notes&quot; in a given<br/>  melody. They come from the mode.</p><p>  OK, now I see it. Above, I used &quot;cadence&quot; in the functional harmonic<br/>  sense, as in V-I. This is about melodic cadences that early polyphony<br/>  took over from the modes. You approach a (e.g. Dorian) finalis by<br/>  steps; if the tenor goes E-D, the cantus goes C(#)-D. A third part has<br/>  to end in A. Counterpoint allows A or G as the note before (depending<br/>  on context, since A is dissonace when E is in the bass and has to be<br/>  introduced properly). But with A, the third part would also not<br/>  partake in the cadence, so it&apos;s G. And if the C is sharp, so is the G.<br/>  In melodic terms, this is a double approach to D. In harmonic terms,<br/>  it would be C# minor-D without a third, but implied minor. So in<br/>  modern, functional terms, this is no cadence at all. Functional<br/>  harmony would have opted for the A and solved the dissonant fourth<br/>  problem by putting the A in the bass. This solution was only possible<br/>  when a fourth, bass, part was introduced in the 15th century.</p><p>So thou sayest!</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Where? I do not recall having done so.

Granted, since keys comprise modes, and not vice versa.</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; The concept of key does this pretty well.</p><p>  But a piece in D doesn&apos;t use jumps and scalewise progressions<br/>  differently from a piece in F, as long as they are in the same mode?</p><p>Right.

The finales could not be relied on, of course, since this<br/>music<br/>&gt; uses triads. Any other deviations from the modes as they should be<br/>&gt; were ascribed to modulations; there was usually some reason in the<br/>&gt; text to adapt the ethos and thus the mode of the music, and the<br/>&gt; so-called mixture of modes was really an intentional expressive<br/>&gt; device. I find this intriguing, but I don&apos;t know the music well<br/>enough<br/>&gt; to have my own opinion about its truth.

All instances of perde Rast in all my posts on this matter should actually be taken as Kaba Rast, which is an octave below Rast. Kaba Rast is the first harmonic, Rast is the second. I conferred with a Neyzen today, and he informed me that they did not any longer think of the first partial pitches as &quot;dem&quot;, or &quot;breathy (pedal) tones&quot;. Now, either my hearing is fundamentally flawed, or I was actually listening to the first partial and paid no attention whatsoever to the second while I was sounding Rast. Accordinly:</p><p>the rast of Kiz Ahenk is 440 Hz.<br/>of Mansur Ahenk, it is 9/8 lower.<br/>of Shah Ahenk, it is 81/64 lower.<br/>of Davud Ahenk, it is 4/3 lower.<br/>of Bolanehk it is 3/2 lower.</p><p>Mustahsen Ahenk&apos;s rast is 9/8 above Kiz.<br/>Sipurde Ahenk&apos;s rast is 81/64 above Kiz.<br/>Yildiz Ahenk&apos;s rast is 4/3 above Kiz.</p><p>I hope this clears up the matter.

Sure, the idea of inversions being functionally the<br/>&gt; same chords has likely existed before Rameau published it (in the<br/>&gt; 1720s?). But during much of that period, thinking was contrapuntal.<br/>&gt; You could add thirds and either a fifth or a sixth to note, and<br/>&gt; resulting fourths had to be treated as a dissonance when involving the<br/>&gt; bass note. The idea of triads might prevent a careless composer from<br/>&gt; writing both a fifth and a sixth against a given note, but apart from<br/>&gt; tha I see no use in reducing the possible chords to one form built<br/>&gt; from thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; klaus</p><p>While claiming no expert knowledge of music of the period,<br/>I largely agree with the thrust of Klaus&apos; comments.  To me,<br/>there&apos;s a fairly clear distinction between contrapuntal and<br/>homophonic styles of music, quite apart from whether the<br/>music is chordal or has parts moving at different speeds.</p><p>In my own music, I often write music that is completely<br/>contrapuntal in its impulse, taking care of questions of<br/>harmony only in a very local manner.  This will on occasion<br/>give rise to using -<br/>&apos;harmonies built in thirds (and what we call their &quot;inversions&quot;<br/>today) as stable consonances and as a textural mainstay&apos;.</p><p>But I occasionally write simple tunes with a clear and simple<br/>harmonic framework in mind, and I set them accordingly,<br/>often with broken chords or with melodic patterns derived<br/>largely from such arpeggios.  And then  I sometimes write<br/>Haydnesque or Mozartesque stuff for small chamber groups<br/>which subordinates my often contrapuntal means to a larger<br/>and perhaps more complex harmonic framework.  Finally,<br/>many of my simple tunes will only admit of a modal treatment,<br/>in which it would be a gross distortion to try to harmonise<br/>them simply with tonal progressions of chords.  The kind of<br/>accompaniment that they demand is more spare, more open<br/>in texture, and more likely to seem antiphonal.  In this,<br/>they are similar to many of the modal folk tunes I learnt<br/>in Malaysia, and also to much of classical Indian music.</p><p>The above illustrate the broad categories I use for<br/>classifying the feel and the means of music.  I offer this<br/>description to avoid being misunderstood :-) by writing, as<br/>I did &quot;modal, as opposed to homophonic or harmonic.&quot;<br/>Perhaps my usage of these terms is not quite standard.</p><p>But I agree also with Paul&apos;s point that these categories do<br/>not set up some kind of Berlin Wall dividing &quot;modal&quot; from<br/>&quot;tonal&quot; or &quot;built on tertian harmony&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.12.2/139 - Release Date: 17/10/05</p></div><h3><a id=61706 href="#61706">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2005 2:23:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>You wrote:<br/>At the risk of being misundestood again, I just want to point out that<br/>Western music continued being &apos;modal&apos; (according to the English-<br/>language literature on the subject) for some 200 years after it adopted<br/>harmonies built in thirds (and what we call their &quot;inversions&quot; today)<br/>as stable consonances and as a textural mainstay. c. 1450-1670.</p><p>I replied:<br/>You won&apos;t get any argument from me.<br/>Yet some of my English-language sources also apply the<br/>term &quot;tonal&quot; in a broad sense to aspects of mediaeval<br/>church modal music ...</p><p>You asked:<br/>At your leisure, would you mind providing a few quotes from these<br/>sources (with date and author, of course)?

Let me see now ... here it is:</p><p>Dictionary of Music, by Theodore Karp, Dell (1973). 448pp.<br/>[Juillard; PhD (Mus) NYU; Chairman of Dept of Music at UCD<br/>in 1973.]</p><p>Obviously not a patch on Groves or Harvard, but an occasionally<br/>useful quick reference. As you&apos;re unlikely to find this around now,<br/>let me quote the entire article; it&apos;s not overly long:</p><p>&quot;Tonality:<br/>(1) in the most comprehensive meaning, a sense of tonal gravity.<br/>The musical styles denoted are such that the listener consciously<br/>or subconsciously perceives that:<br/>(a) the main musical impulses arise from and flow toward one or<br/>a limited number of tone centers, these tones thus acquiring<br/>greater importance than the remainder;<br/>(b) these tone centers themselves vary in importance and<br/>function, the main center serving as the point of ultimate repose<br/>(see FORM). In this sense, tonality may be observed in music<br/>based on the CHURCH MODES, in music based on the major and<br/>minor modes, and in much MODERN MUSIC that has broken<br/>away from the conventions of major and minor. (Much of the<br/>latter music is often -- though incorrectly -- referred to as<br/>_atonal_.) To a large extent, tonality is an objective quality<br/>dependent merely upon musical construction. However, there is<br/>also a limited area in which tonality is a subjective quality,<br/>dependent upon the listener&apos;s perceptivity and familiarity with<br/>a given idiom. Those who regularly listen to and perform music<br/>in contemporary idioms acquire the ability to perceive tone<br/>centers whose existence passes unnoticed by those who do not<br/>have a thorough familiarity with those idioms.</p><p>(2) In a more restricted meaning, the melodic, harmonic, and<br/>rhythmic vocabulary or the major-minor system. The basic<br/>PITCH materials of major and minor are discussed under<br/>SCALE. Some ofthe conventions of this system are as follows.<br/>MELODY normally unfolds against a harmonic background,<br/>whether reall or imaginary. (The frequency of broken chords<br/>in melodic writing -- e.g., in _The Star Spangled Banner_ and in<br/>BEETHOVEN&apos;s _Erocia Symphony_ -- is one illustration of this<br/>trait.) The most important tonal center is established by the<br/>tonic chord. Ths is contrasted with a second important center<br/>established by the DOMINANT chord (based on the fifth<br/>degree), the sub-dominant chord constituting a possible third<br/>center. Each chord has but a few functions, these serving<br/>ultimately to circumscribe the TONIC. There is a powerful<br/>drive toward the tonic from the half-step below, the leading<br/>tone (seventh dgree). The basic harmonic drives are<br/>reinforced by symmetrical rhythms, which help the informed<br/>listener to anticipate many progressions toward the tonal<br/>center. The compoer may introduce tones foreign to the key<br/>for ornamental puposes, or, in an extended movement or work,<br/>he may introduce such notes in order to establish new keys --<br/>momentarily cancelling the sense of tonal gravity that accrues<br/>to the main tone center. The various keys are related to each<br/>other in a fixed hierarchy.

Hence,<br/>&gt;   maqams are keys, where the scales they utilize comprise certain degrees<br/>&gt;   emphasized as tonal centers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   This definition does not use the word &quot;key&quot;.  But insofar as it<br/>&gt;   describes maqam music, that music shows evidence of tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How can tonal gravity (musical flow through closely related tone centers)<br/>be achieved without &grave;key&grave; might I ask?</p><p>You&apos;re asking me?  In my view, we have many techniques available<br/>for creating tone centres; among them are: meter, rhythm, stress,<br/>duration, and ornament. oh yes; and leading tones.  In order to<br/>achieve musical flow through closely related tone centres, we have<br/>only to shift the emphasis from one of those tone centre to another<br/>in a musical (usually a measured or metrical) way.</p><p>I can give you an example, a traditional English song called &quot;Who<br/>will buy (my beautiful ribbons)&quot;.  At least as I hear it and play it,<br/>this is in the minor pentatonic mode of E, and modulates momentarily<br/>(for the second phrase of four) to the minor pentatonic mode of A.<br/>These two tone centres are established purely by melodic and<br/>rhythmic means; there is no need of any second part or harmony.<br/>Nor is there any leading tone available to use.  I could send you a<br/>NoteWorthy Composer score file if you wish.  There are many more<br/>modal folk tunes from the same mould.  While you can set these<br/>tunes in tertian harmonies from a heptatonic key (and many have),<br/>this does much violence to their essentially pentatonic and modal<br/>nature.  It actually sounds much better harmonised mostly with<br/>fourths.</p><p>&gt;   &gt; Such is also my observation concerning some, who, while not very much<br/>&gt;   acquainted with Maqam Music, erroneously conclude after their first<br/>&gt;   impression that this genre is modal rather than tonal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Guilty!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as charged!</p><p>Oho!  I *thought* you were having a go at me!  :-)</p><p>Still,  I wonder whether you will hear &quot;Who will buy&quot; as being in<br/>the key of E minor, rather than being modal - just *because* it<br/>modulates?</p><p>&gt;   &gt; Oddly enough, the majority wishes to percieve just this, and nothing<br/>more<br/>&gt;   about tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   That&apos;s just the limits of their knowledge, I guess.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or cultural conditioning? Branding Maqamat as modes does not show the lack<br/>of a better substitute term, it just shows how easily biased people tend to<br/>categorize non-Western melodic scales as &grave;contra-tonal&grave;, and how eventually<br/>Easterners incline to accept such terminological norms in order to<br/>facilitate communications with the aforementioned party.</p><p>I defer to your experience of this situation.</p><p>&gt;   &gt;   There is a powerful<br/>&gt;   &gt;   drive toward the tonic from the half-step below, the leading<br/>&gt;   &gt;   tone (seventh degree).<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; The leading tone is a most important diatonical feature for the<br/>majority<br/>&gt;   of Maqams.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Yes, and in much modal music, too.  Though such music may have<br/>&gt;   leading tones on other degrees a well, eg the minor second.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In tonal music, the leading tone is always the 7th from the tonic, unless<br/>I am unaware of something here? You will find this feature to be a dominant<br/>trait of the Maqamat.</p><p>Perhaps you might say instead, &quot;in tonal music of a given key, the<br/>leading tone ...&quot;.  The example I gave of the minor second occurs<br/>in some Japanese modes and Indian ragas, most particularly and<br/>obviously in those whose scales have a flat seventh or no seventh<br/>at all.  There&apos;s a rag - I forget the name - with a scale like this:<br/>take the notes of F harmonic minor, but C is the tonic.  You may<br/>try improvising in it on a keyboard if you like, like this: with the<br/>right hand, play a melody with lots of stepwise movements and<br/>sequences, predominantly falling rather than rising; do not dwell<br/>especially in the region of the notes F or E, but rather more so<br/>on Db and C.  To reinforce the feeling that C is the tonic note,<br/>use the left hand to simulate a Dotara accompaniment, softly<br/>cycling through the notes C3, G3 and C4.  If you introduce any<br/>chromatic notes in your improvised melody, avoid using B natural<br/>over much, except as a melodic anticipation of a move to Bb and<br/>beyond.  If you undertake this experiment, you will probably begin<br/>to feel the pull of the Db toward the C.  You may notice, as a<br/>secondary effect of similar kind, that the other two semitones<br/>also have a strong pull: Ab to G and E to F.  In this rag, it is not<br/>usually proper to emphasise the subdominant degree on F, but it<br/>is normal to emphasise the dominant degree on G.</p><p>Try it: it&apos;s fun!</p><p>&gt;   &gt;   The basic harmonic drives are<br/>&gt;   &gt;   reinforced by symmetrical rhythms, which help the informed<br/>&gt;   &gt;   listener to anticipate many progressions toward the tonal<br/>&gt;   &gt;   center.<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; Maqam Music rhythms, otherwise known as Usuls, also serve to reinforce<br/>&gt;   this tonal response.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Lovely!  Where can I learn more about these &quot;Usuls&quot; (&grave;Usulun,<br/>&gt;   meaning bases?) ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you tried Walter Feldman&apos;s &grave;Music of the Ottoman Court&grave;?</p><p>Haven&apos;t even heard of it before now!  Would you recommend it<br/>as an accurate account?</p><p>&gt;   &gt;   The compo[s]er may introduce tones foreign to the key<br/>&gt;   &gt;   for ornamental puposes, or, in an extended movement or work,<br/>&gt;   &gt;   he may introduce such notes in order to establish new keys --<br/>&gt;   &gt;   momentarily cancelling the sense of tonal gravity that accrues<br/>&gt;   &gt;   to the main tone center.<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; Wonderfully accurate in the case of Maqam Music, which is largely<br/>&gt;   diatonical - and thus, tonal - in nature as far as I know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I still haven&apos;t heard an example of this, but would like to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shortage of readily available streaming audio content in this genre is a<br/>major bummer. But surely I am not to blame. For more examples, you may want<br/>to go to the local CD store and take a look at the world music shelves.<br/>There are recordings of improvisations on the traditional tanbur and ney<br/>that you may chance upon.</p><p>Streaming audio is of little use on slow dial-up, anyway :-(<br/>So it seems that you will leave me to flounder, rather than<br/>lighting the way?  If I went to the local CD store I would<br/>find mostly rubbish on the world music shelves, as I have<br/>before.  And if I made my way to the specialist music<br/>stores in the city, I could spend much more than I could<br/>afford in buying up everything that looked likely, and still<br/>have no guarantee of hearing the phenomenon that you<br/>describe!</p><p>As you yourself said, you could show me these things<br/>best directly, if we could meet face to face.  But failing<br/>that, the next most useful thing, surely, would be for you<br/>to recommend a particular piece by a particular artist,<br/>and tell me what to listen for and when.  If you could do<br/>that, I would be very grateful - and perhaps a little more<br/>enlightened.</p><p>&gt;   &gt; Such is also the case when establishing consonance-dissonance<br/>&gt;   relationships in Maqam Music. Some Maqams are indeed quite distant to<br/>&gt;   others, and a straightforward modulation to and fro would seem awkward<br/>at<br/>&gt;   best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Presumably distance is along the circle of fifths?<br/>&gt;   Or would modulation by a third also be common?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes fourths and even major sixths as well.</p><p>Excellent!  And how would you prepare for a modulation to<br/>the major sixth - or could you step there directly?</p><p>&gt;   &gt;   The composer normally is expected<br/>&gt;   &gt;   to evolve a course between closely related keys, though he<br/>&gt;   &gt;   may often surprise the listener by an imaginative excursion to<br/>&gt;   &gt;   distant keys.<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; A splendid yet simple illustration as to the melodic genius of many<br/>&gt;   historic Maqam Music composers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Again, I&apos;d love to hear this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, I wish I could illustrate to you right hand on my Qanun, or my<br/>bowed Tanbur!</p><p>And so do I! :-)</p><p>&gt;   &gt;   Regardless of the freedom that may be<br/>&gt;   &gt;   employed in modulating from one key to another, a return to<br/>&gt;   &gt;   the original tonic is an inevitable expectation of the major-<br/>&gt;   &gt;   minor system.<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; Likewise with Maqams, where an eventual return to the tonic is<br/>customary.<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt;   (3) In the most limited sense, a synonym for KEY.&quot;<br/>&gt;   &gt;<br/>&gt;   &gt; Bingo! Yet, I wouldn not have over-stressed the limited part.<br/>Certainly,<br/>&gt;   tonality is key-orientation in relation to form.

That is, it uses the notes F G Ab C Db.  Is this just<br/>an impoverished F minor key?  I think not, for if you<br/>harmonise it using Fm, Bb and C7, you&apos;ve introduced two<br/>foreign notes and given them more weight than the melody<br/>can support.  As in much Japanese art, it&apos;s the _spaces<br/>between_ that really count.  It&apos;s possible to harmonise the<br/>melody using only scale tones, but it needs a light touch -<br/>and definitely has no leading tone on the seventh!</p><p>&gt; And why should we refrain from calling a Japanese pentatonic a key, but<br/>not a mode?</p><p>Because it&apos;s not a key, and it is a mode. :-)</p><p>I&apos;ve just shown how one pentatonic scale, with tonic F,<br/>has no leading tone.  Is it still a key despite that?<br/>I don&apos;t think so - not unless &quot;key&quot; suddenly has much<br/>wider connotations than usual.</p><p>By choosing the note C as tonic, yet using the same<br/>scale, we clearly have another mode.  Again, try it<br/>for yourself; use all your wiles and musical prowess<br/>to emphasise the note C rather than any other -<br/>particularly Db.  Here is another mode of the same<br/>scale as before; it, too, lacks a leading tone.</p><p>Ozan, I would like to be able to hear what you hear<br/>in maqam music.  I would also like you to be able to<br/>hear what I hear in modal music.  Perhaps we can<br/>achieve these aims if we continue to share<br/>information to the best of our ability, while avoiding<br/>the temptation to score points off each other. :-)<br/>(I know I find that hard.)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.361 / Virus Database: 267.12.4/146 - Release Date: 21/10/05</p></div><h3><a id=61950 href="#61950">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2005 2:54:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Yahya,<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 26 Ekim 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 16:08<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Keys and modes</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; How can tonal gravity (musical flow through closely related tone centers)<br/>  be achieved without &grave;key&grave; might I ask?</p><p>  You&apos;re asking me?</p><p>Indeed, you along with any who might be interested to respond.</p><p>  In my view, we have many techniques available<br/>  for creating tone centres; among them are: meter, rhythm, stress,<br/>  duration, and ornament. oh yes; and leading tones.

There&apos;s a rag - I forget the name - with a scale like this:<br/>&gt; &gt;   take the notes of F harmonic minor, but C is the tonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A plagal mode obviously.

That is, it uses the notes F G Ab C Db.  Is this just<br/>&gt; &gt;   an impoverished F minor key?</p><p>&gt; Nope, it is a composition in the Key of F pentatonic (of whatever category<br/>this may fall into), which happens to be the SCALA 1-4-2-1-4 mode, dubbed<br/>the Han-kumoi-joshi.</p><p>F is the tonic; the mode is 2-1-4-1-4.  Please tell me why it is a key?</p><p>&gt; &gt;   I think not, for if you<br/>&gt; &gt;   harmonise it using Fm, Bb and C7, you&apos;ve introduced two<br/>&gt; &gt;   foreign notes and given them more weight than the melody<br/>&gt; &gt;   can support.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would do no such thing of course. You do not need those notes in the<br/>polyphony.</p><p>I&apos;m glad to hear it.  But am fascinated to know how<br/>harmonising this tune with only notes from this mode<br/>can turn it into a key.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   As in much Japanese art, it&apos;s the _spaces<br/>&gt; &gt;   between_ that really count.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it is the case for Maqam Music.</p><p>Wonderful!  I&apos;ll be listening for them.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   It&apos;s possible to harmonise the<br/>&gt; &gt;   melody using only scale tones, but it needs a light touch -<br/>&gt; &gt;   and definitely has no leading tone on the seventh!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Granted. But it still is a key if it modulates or tranposes with gusto.</p><p>Diatonic transpositions within the notes of the mode?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; And why should we refrain from calling a Japanese pentatonic a key,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not a mode?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because it&apos;s not a key, and it is a mode. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And a minor is not a mode???? Come on now, all keys are based on modes.</p><p>What is the extra something that says: with this,<br/>we have a key, without it, we have [only] a mode?</p><p>&gt; &gt;   I&apos;ve just shown how one pentatonic scale, with tonic F,<br/>&gt; &gt;   has no leading tone.  Is it still a key despite that?<br/>&gt; &gt;   I don&apos;t think so - not unless &quot;key&quot; suddenly has much<br/>&gt; &gt;   wider connotations than usual.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What deprives us from thinking in that manner while you agree to<br/>over-stretch the historical definition of ecclesiastical modes to comprise<br/>maqams and ragas?</p><p>I thought I was using the term &quot;mode&quot; in the generally<br/>accepted sense of a system of tonality not characterised<br/>by the use of tertian harmonies, and where harmony is<br/>forever the servant of melody.  The term &quot;mode&quot; does not,<br/>for me, first and foremost evoke the Dark Ages of Europe,<br/>but rather the Golden Age of Greece.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   By choosing the note C as tonic, yet using the same<br/>&gt; &gt;   scale, we clearly have another mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Upon which a key is based.</p><p>Again, what&apos;s the difference? Is a key just a mode that<br/>you&apos;re so unsure of you keep changing and jumping from<br/>one to another?</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Again, try it<br/>&gt; &gt;   for yourself; use all your wiles and musical prowess<br/>&gt; &gt;   to emphasise the note C rather than any other -<br/>&gt; &gt;   particularly Db.  Here is another mode of the same<br/>&gt; &gt;   scale as before; it, too, lacks a leading tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One needs no leading tone to modulate, only wit and gusto. Domenico<br/>Scarlatti himself uses to supertonic as a substitute for the leading tone.<br/>Does he not compose in keys then?</p><p>Now there&apos;s an interesting question!  Ralph Kirkpatrick,<br/>I believe, makes the point that more than a few of<br/>Scarlatti&apos;s Sonatas cannot be considered to be in keys.<br/>And that is certainly my experience of some of them.</p><p>&gt; &gt;   Ozan, I would like to be able to hear what you hear<br/>&gt; &gt;   in maqam music.

The reason this can be true is that<br/>the composition creates gravity around the Lydian mode of<br/>the diatonic scale, but the diatonic scale itself, to<br/>Western ears accustomed to Western tonal music, has weaker<br/>modes and stronger modes, and only 2 of its modes are<br/>traditionally considered strong enough to denote key.</p><p>Paul&apos;s explanation for this (IIRC from his paper on the<br/>decatonic scales) is that the diminished fifth (the only<br/>dissonance in a diatonic interval class that contains<br/>consonances) is adjacent to the root perfect fifths of<br/>only the Ionian and Aeolian modes.  And if you play open<br/>fifths on I-II-VII-I in all modes, there does seem to be<br/>subtle pull in those modes: from the VII up in the Ionian<br/>and from the II down in the Aeolian.</p><p>So in Western music, there is the gravity created by<br/>the composition (mode) and the gravity created by the<br/>scale, all else being equal (key).

Musicians of that time<br/>avoided the locrian mode like the plague, primarily because<br/>the 5th above the tonic is a diminished-5th and not a<br/>perfect-5th -- close relative of the &quot;tritone&quot;, the old<br/>_diabolus in musica_,</p><p>The &quot;tritone&quot; is properly the augmented-4th, and in<br/>12-edo the diminished-5th is exactly the same pitch.<br/>But during the medieval/Renaissance, the tuning was<br/>theoretically pythagorean and not 12-edo, so they<br/>actually were different intervals.</p><p>This is a very interesting topic which has a lot to<br/>do with the history of musical notation -- the flat and<br/>sharp symbols have their origins in the desire to<br/>&quot;mutate&quot; from one hexachord to another so as to avoid<br/>the _diabolus in musica_ by altering the diminished-5ths<br/>and augmented-4ths into their respective &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>counterparts.</p><p>Thus, wherever a composition would have putatively made<br/>use of the locrian mode, a mutation was made so that<br/>the F would be made sharp or the B would be made flat,<br/>so as to transform the F:B into F#:B or F:Bb, or the<br/>B:F into B:F# or Bb:F. Whether it was F going sharp or<br/>B going flat depended on the requirements of the particular<br/>chant or tune.</p><p>Originally, the flat and sharp symbols were simply the<br/>&quot;round-B&quot; or &quot;square-B&quot; respectively, and indicated only<br/>that a mutation was to be made into a &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;hard&quot;<br/>hexachord. Over time, the two different B&apos;s evolved<br/>into our modern symbols, and eventually, instead of<br/>signifying a mutation into a certain hexachord, they<br/>came to mean simply a raising or lowering of pitch by<br/>a semitone.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=62007 href="#62007">ðŸ”—</a>Mocfujita@aol.com</h3><span>10/31/2005 2:14:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The Secret of Prelude No.24 B minor<br/>An Addictive Analysis by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach<br/>in 1744 (fiction by imyfujita)</p><p>&gt; My great father Johann Sebastian Bach told me to make some comments about<br/>&gt; this prelude, the Well Tempered Clavier Prelude No. 24 B minor.

There&apos;s a rag - I forget the name - with a scale like this:<br/>  &gt; &gt;   take the notes of F harmonic minor, but C is the tonic.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; A plagal mode obviously. Furthermore, it bears a striking resemblance to<br/>  the principal Devr (mode, or scale/gamut) of Maqam Hijaz.</p><p>  A mode, you say ... not a key?</p><p>Devr is mode, as in octave species of a scale from a global set of pitches. That is why Ilm-i Edvar, or the Science of Cycles/Modes bears a striking resemblance to Medieval music theories of Europe. Maqam is not mode, it is key, as in modal rotations around a tonal center. It is surprising that Maqams came into existence in the Middle East around the same time as keys evolved from modality in the West. The Rast Maqam is the Key of Rast based on the 5-limit tempered Ionian mode as well as other modes around which it modulates.</p><p>  &gt; &gt; &gt;   Lovely!

All will<br/>  be revealed ...&quot;.</p><p>That is what the noble sheik decreed. Behold! It shall all be revealed in due time! :)</p><p>  &gt; &gt;   If you play it with F as the tonic note, the scale is similar<br/>  &gt; &gt;   to the rag  I described before, but without the fourth and<br/>  &gt; &gt;   seventh.  That is, it uses the notes F G Ab C Db.  Is this just<br/>  &gt; &gt;   an impoverished F minor key?</p><p>  &gt; Nope, it is a composition in the Key of F pentatonic (of whatever category<br/>  this may fall into), which happens to be the SCALA 1-4-2-1-4 mode, dubbed<br/>  the Han-kumoi-joshi.</p><p>  F is the tonic; the mode is 2-1-4-1-4.  Please tell me why it is a key?</p><p>It will become a key once a piece is composed with it. One would have to be a pretty dull composer to labor so that a mode does not become a key. All modes eventually become keys once a good piece is composed with it, unless a modulation is specifically avoided throughout, in which case I would consign it the term mode, avoid calling it worthwhile music and be done with it.</p><p>  &gt; &gt;   I think not, for if you<br/>  &gt; &gt;   harmonise it using Fm, Bb and C7, you&apos;ve introduced two<br/>  &gt; &gt;   foreign notes and given them more weight than the melody<br/>  &gt; &gt;   can support.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; I would do no such thing of course. You do not need those notes in the<br/>  polyphony.</p><p>  I&apos;m glad to hear it.  But am fascinated to know how<br/>  harmonising this tune with only notes from this mode<br/>  can turn it into a key.</p><p>First give me a section of the music, then I will try to harmonise it according to its pentatonic key the way I hear it.</p><p>  &gt; &gt;   It&apos;s possible to harmonise the<br/>  &gt; &gt;   melody using only scale tones, but it needs a light touch -<br/>  &gt; &gt;   and definitely has no leading tone on the seventh!<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Granted. But it still is a key if it modulates or tranposes with gusto.</p><p>  Diatonic transpositions within the notes of the mode?</p><p>Modulations as in rotations of the scale, transpositions as in an exact linear pitch-shift while preserving the intervallic structure.</p><p>  &gt; &gt; &gt; And why should we refrain from calling a Japanese pentatonic a key,<br/>  but<br/>  &gt; &gt; &gt; not a mode?<br/>  &gt; &gt;<br/>  &gt; &gt; Because it&apos;s not a key, and it is a mode. :-)<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; And a minor is not a mode???? Come on now, all keys are based on modes.</p><p>  What is the extra something that says: with this,<br/>  we have a key, without it, we have [only] a mode?</p><p>We have a mode when it is explained on paper, just as we have a scale when we look at a scala file. We have a key once we do something with them which we call music.</p><p>  &gt; &gt;   I&apos;ve just shown how one pentatonic scale, with tonic F,<br/>  &gt; &gt;   has no leading tone.  Is it still a key despite that?<br/>  &gt; &gt;   I don&apos;t think so - not unless &quot;key&quot; suddenly has much<br/>  &gt; &gt;   wider connotations than usual.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; What deprives us from thinking in that manner while you agree to<br/>  over-stretch the historical definition of ecclesiastical modes to comprise<br/>  maqams and ragas?</p><p>  I thought I was using the term &quot;mode&quot; in the generally<br/>  accepted sense of a system of tonality not characterised<br/>  by the use of tertian harmonies, and where harmony is<br/>  forever the servant of melody.  The term &quot;mode&quot; does not,<br/>  for me, first and foremost evoke the Dark Ages of Europe,<br/>  but rather the Golden Age of Greece.</p><p>Just because Ancient Greek Music is based on modal heterophony does not mean that mode itself implies any extra information for tonality, be it tertian or otherwise. We say major and minor, but we correlate them in a system of keys, specifically because they acquire the necessary tonal meaning when utilized as keys. And no, a key does not imply tertian harmony, it only relates modes and their transpositions to each other by certain rules which are subject to change depending on culture and tradition. Late 19th Century European Music differs widely from Classical and Baroque, in that Romantic composers utilize another system of keys (still widely unformulated) altogether. That is why Respigni is so much more different from Couperin, although they are both tonal composers who employed keys in their works.</p><p>  &gt; &gt;   By choosing the note C as tonic, yet using the same<br/>  &gt; &gt;   scale, we clearly have another mode.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Upon which a key is based.</p><p>  Again, what&apos;s the difference? Is a key just a mode that<br/>  you&apos;re so unsure of you keep changing and jumping from<br/>  one to another?</p><p>Are you even following what I&apos;ve been trying to say since the beginning?</p><p>  &gt; &gt;   Again, try it<br/>  &gt; &gt;   for yourself; use all your wiles and musical prowess<br/>  &gt; &gt;   to emphasise the note C rather than any other -<br/>  &gt; &gt;   particularly Db.  Here is another mode of the same<br/>  &gt; &gt;   scale as before; it, too, lacks a leading tone.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; One needs no leading tone to modulate, only wit and gusto. Domenico<br/>  Scarlatti himself uses to supertonic as a substitute for the leading tone.<br/>  Does he not compose in keys then?</p><p>  Now there&apos;s an interesting question!  Ralph Kirkpatrick,<br/>  I believe, makes the point that more than a few of<br/>  Scarlatti&apos;s Sonatas cannot be considered to be in keys.<br/>  And that is certainly my experience of some of them.</p><p>Balderdash. Scarlatti was a tonal composer whose works are based on keys entirely, be they conventional or unconventional. Would you be kind enough to show me which Scarlatti sonatas are not in keys? If we were to give in to that logic, we would have to dump thousands of tonal works out the window just because they do not conform to a narrow understanding of key, which is oft imagined to be a synoym for mainstream tertian harmony.</p><p>  &gt; &gt;   Ozan, I would like to be able to hear what you hear<br/>  &gt; &gt;   in maqam music.  I would also like you to be able to<br/>  &gt; &gt;   hear what I hear in modal music.

And if you play open<br/>  fifths on I-II-VII-I in all modes, there does seem to be<br/>  subtle pull in those modes: from the VII up in the Ionian<br/>  and from the II down in the Aeolian.</p><p>Other modes have no less tempting tonal attractions, and I&apos;m not even talking about Church modes.</p><p>  So in Western music, there is the gravity created by<br/>  the composition (mode) and the gravity created by the<br/>  scale, all else being equal (key).  When these are<br/>  the same, we just specify a &quot;key&quot;.  When they differ,<br/>  we specify a mode and/or a key.</p><p>Do you agree that a C Major key and a C Minor key are different tonalities?

Clearly I misunderstood you, but I don&apos;t know<br/>how.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=62130 href="#62130">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2005 2:58:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Maybe we understand different things from modulation?</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: wallyesterpaulrus<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 04 Kas&imath;m 2005 Cuma 0:41<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Keys and modes</p><p>  I would love to see a response from Haresh or another Indian<br/>  musician.

Plenty of music I love<br/>  doesn&apos;t modulate; that&apos;s all.</p></div>
