I had heard an early incarnation of this work in a private<br/>recital a couple of years ago, with the composer at the keyboard. Harrison&apos;s<br/>approach, which grew partly from his work with composer La Monte Young,<br/>exploits the overtones generated naturally by vibrating strings-the series of<br/>pitches that resonates softly above every &quot;fundamental&quot; tone. For acoustical<br/>reasons these are obscured in the modern piano&apos;s usual equal-tempered tuning.<br/>The results here are often surprising and wondrous.</p><p>For example, in the midst of clouds of dense clusters rapidly drummed in the<br/>bass end of the instrument, an astute listener can perceive high ghost<br/>tones-sometimes bell-like, at other times vaporous-as if a choir of angels<br/>were singing along. The piece can run as long as 90 minutes, and its sections<br/>build toward a climax during which I would have sworn that Brazilian singer<br/>Milton Nasciemento had entered the room and begun chanting around a high B<br/>Flat. Joshua Pierce&apos;s rendering of the score was virtuosic in the best sense:<br/>technically accomplished and emotionally committed in every moment. When the<br/>piece was pensive, he was tender and thoughtful; when it wanted to soar, he<br/>unleashed a torrent of energy.</p><p>The intricate textures and remarkable effects of Revelation are the result of<br/>Harrison&apos;s desire to &quot;emancipate the comma.&quot; This re-working of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>famous phrase about the emancipation of dissonance registers the seriousness<br/>of his goal. A &quot;comma&quot; is the difference between two intervals with same<br/>name-a third, for example, or an octave-arrived at through different tunings<br/>systems. For example, a major third produced in Pythagorean tuning (based on<br/>a series of pure fifths) is wider than one produced by a naturally vibrating<br/>string. Play these two versions of the same third together and the result is<br/>a jarring dissonance. For centuries, musicians sought to avoid these clashes;<br/>Harrison incorporates them into the texture of his music.</p><p>In some ways, Harrison&apos;s vision represents the philosophical flip side of<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s. Schoenberg&apos;s revolution in Western music, through which he<br/>broke down conventional harmonic models, was by its nature horizontal:<br/>everything built from rows of tones scrupulously ordered, with no one tone<br/>more important than another. Harrison&apos;s approach is vertical: harmony built<br/>on subtle harmony, overtones wrestling or reinforcing each other-producing a<br/>concoction of sound filled with otherworldly resonances. The difference<br/>between these approaches brings to mind an age-old argument, voiced in the<br/>eighteenth century between Rameau and Rousseau, over whether music attains<br/>expressivity through harmony or melody.</p><p>Schoenberg dissolved the distinction between consonance and dissonance. In<br/>similar fashion, Harrison rehabilitates the comma into a newly welcome<br/>constituent of the harmonic universe. This gives rise to an exciting and<br/>often moving musical dimension-one that may well be the path toward music&apos;s<br/>future.</p><p>Stuart Isacoff, a pianist and composer, is founding editor of the magazine<br/>Piano Today, Executive Editor of Sheet Music Magazine and a recipient of the<br/>ASCAP Deems Taylor Award for excellence in writing about music.</p></div>
