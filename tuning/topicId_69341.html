How would you go<br/>about with deciding which intervals are to be considered &quot;higher&quot; or<br/>&quot;more advanced&quot; than others?</p><p>/&Atilde;Â–</p></div><h3><a id=69342 href="#69342">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2007 2:12:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mats &Ouml;&not;jare &lt;oljare@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if there has ever been an attempt to create a just set<br/>&gt; theory, giving numbers to all intervals, triads etc.</p><p>The first thing to say about musical set theory is that it isn&apos;t set<br/>theory, and the basic structure being analyzed is a group (in the usual<br/>case, the cyclic group with twelve elements, C12.) In the case of p-<br/>limit JI modulo octaves, you get a very different group--the free group<br/>of odd-ratio members of the p-limit, with a unique reduced odd-number<br/>ratio representing each interval class. This, therefore, is what you<br/>would take n-element subsets of, but unlike the case with equal<br/>temperament, you don&apos;t get a finite number of chords. Hence you<br/>probably want to bound the results somehow. One way is to confine<br/>yourself to chords of a scale, another is to bound heights.</p></div><h3><a id=69343 href="#69343">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2007 2:29:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; The first thing to say about musical set theory is that it isn&apos;t<br/>set<br/>&gt; theory, and the basic structure being analyzed is a group (in the<br/>usual<br/>&gt; case, the cyclic group with twelve elements, C12.)</p><p>It seems to me that more fruitful than JI musical set theory might be<br/>mst for rank one temperaments, particularly linear temperaments such<br/>as meantone or miracle.
