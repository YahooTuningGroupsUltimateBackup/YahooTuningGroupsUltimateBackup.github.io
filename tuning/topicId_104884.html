The geometry of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Terpstra keyboard layout is characterized by a vertical shift in position<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between the top surface of a key and the six keys adjacent to it. This results<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in an intuitive feel for changes in pitch as your fingers move across the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each key has a removable magnetic key cap, so different colored or labeled key<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caps can be easily swapped around when you re-map the keys to a different scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The main difference with our keyboard is the expressivity allowed by the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanical action of the keys, which is completely different from other similar<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keyboards that had been produced in the past.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The key sensing for the Terpstra is one of a kind because the electronics<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constantly monitor the position of every key by magnetically sensing for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole key throw (not by triggering switches at the bottom of the key press and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measuring the time differential). When a key is depressed, the entire change in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position is monitored and translated to a very accurate and nuanced velocity by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time the key hits the bottom.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I am a keyboard player and the feel of the Terpstra was really exceptional<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and had very expressive touch that was lighter but much like a real piano, only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faster.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every key is easily re-mappable and if mapped to a continuous controller, then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly depressing any re-mapped key sends out continuous data like a fader in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; real time. It does all of this with no latency.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Upon seeing it, I could immediately appreciate the manufacturing quality of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this prototype &acirc;Â€&quot; well made thick aluminum case with a look and solidity that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is reminiscent of Apple G5 and 8-core towers.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Keyboards take a huge amount of abuse during live performance. This one is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; precision machine built like a tank; it can withstand the constant pounding of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an energetic concert performance.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This innovative and quality controller has a key layout that, unlike the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bosanquet, Jank&Atilde;&sup3; and other generalized/isomorphic keyboards, puts each key at a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly different height &acirc;Â€&quot; which when combined with the irregular shape of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front row of keys, allows you to feel where your hands are on the keys<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without looking. This means that for the first time you can play a matrix<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keyboard without having to constantly look at it to know where you are.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I would LOVE to map some keys to sweep filters, and leave other keys as notes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to trigger the sounds feeding through the filter. This WOULD be the funkiest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; microtonal thing ever!&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The product designers who built the only 2 working prototypes are ready to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a 20-pieces order.

Moreover, the major second should be a &quot;major&quot; wholetone, while the minor second should be a &quot;small&quot; semitone - as a consequence, the wholetone is to be divided into a smaller semitone (limma) and a larger one (apotome). A good key layout for maqam tunings I would define as one where all these 4 types of seconds are &quot;easily available&quot; (whatever that means).</p><p>I had a look at 53edo, which is one of the EDOs that are often recommended for middle-eastern (and also indian) music). Then, the key intervals above are (according to <a href="http://www.alsiadi.com/maqamat.html">http://www.alsiadi.com/maqamat.html</a>) rendered as 4, 6, 7 and 9 steps. (The apotome as 9-4=5 steps). Now I tried to find a layout where these 4 intervals are as close together as possible. Unfortunately, I found that there is no solution where all intervals are not more than 2 steps apart - it always takes 3 steps for at least one interval.</p><p>I just posted one proposal for a 53edo layout for the Terpstra keyboard. It places 4 steps (limma), 5 steps (apotome and its difference 1 step (syntonic comma). The wholoetone and the smaller neutral second are two steps away while the larger neutrla second (for the Rast scale) needs 3 steps. I added some note names according to the pythagorean tuning and colorings for the Rast and the Bayati tetrachord.</p><p>File is here:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/hstraub64/Terpstra%2053edo1.png">/tuning/files/hstraub64/Terpstra%2053edo1.png</a></p><p>I think this is a workable layout for oriental melodic stuff - less so for harmony. And 53edo anyway has already so terrible many notes - the whole large Terpstra keyboard hardly spans 3 octaves here...</p><p>For this reason, I also had a look at 41edo, mentioned by Ozan Yarman as a possible EDO for maqams. Here the limma is rendered as 3 steps, the apotome as 4 steps, the two neutral seconds as 5 and 6 steps and the major wholetone as 7 steps. Applying the analogous layout as sketched above for 53edo gives 3 steps, 4 steps and its difference 1 step as primary axes, and here it comes out that all important intervals can be reached with at most 2 steps.</p><p>Point is here, however, that the larger neutral seconds (6 steps) can also be seen as a minor wholetone, and, playing the Rast maqam with it, the third note is less a neutral third than a 5/4-style major third. I have learned that the turkish variant of Rast indeed has such a third - the arabic variant, however, is lower. So I would conclude that 41edo is a good tuning for turkish music (and so may be the sketched layout for the Terpstra keyboard) but less so for arabic music.</p></div><h3><a id=104978 href="#104978">ðŸ”—</a>kraiggrady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2012 7:55:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There are a variety of layouts of mideast tunings on generalized keyboards in this document.<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF</a></p><p>--<br/>signature file</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div><h3><a id=104979 href="#104979">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2012 4:41:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraiggrady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are a variety of layouts of mideast tunings on generalized<br/>&gt; keyboards in this document.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for that!</p><p>Hmm, yes, as far as I understand, there is just one layout in the document, and basically for 24edo, with 4 steps (major second) in one axis, 3 steps (neutral second) in the second axis and 7 steps (neutral third) in the third axis.

The various divisions of the octave differ only because some methods take into account a greater number of intervals.

Like I could effectively make a patch where the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pitch glides up into being in tune, and it would glide up as I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; press the keys down and then come into pitch at the end when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fully depressed?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Any MIDI continuous controller can do this when attached<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to a synth configured to respond this way. The difference is,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one does not normally have access to an array of 276 tiny<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous controllers.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about vibrato? Would it be easy enough to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; press down and partially release to create a vibrato effect,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like one could do with aftertouch?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t played the keyboard. Whether a convincing vibrato<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (as we normally think of it in music) would be easy/comfortable<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to produce this way depends on the physical and MIDI response<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of its keys. Generally, pressure controllers are easier to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; make vibrato with. But it is possible.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So is it possible to achieve an aftertouch-like effect where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; velocity sensitivity still exists but controller data can be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sent as well?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is it more like any key is either a controller or a velocity-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive key?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or could it at least be set to play pitches and still respond<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in some way after the onset, like back away to fade out or in?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know.

The geometry of<br/>the Terpstra keyboard layout is characterized by a vertical shift in<br/>position between the top surface of a key and the six keys adjacent to<br/>it. This results in an intuitive feel for changes in pitch as your<br/>fingers move across the keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each key has a removable magnetic key cap, so different colored or<br/>labeled key caps can be easily swapped around when you re-map the keys<br/>to a different scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The main difference with our keyboard is the expressivity allowed by<br/>the mechanical action of the keys, which is completely different from<br/>other similar keyboards that had been produced in the past.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The key sensing for the Terpstra is one of a kind because the<br/>electronics constantly monitor the position of every key by magnetically<br/>sensing for the whole key throw (not by triggering switches at the<br/>bottom of the key press and measuring the time differential). When a key<br/>is depressed, the entire change in position is monitored and translated<br/>to a very accurate and nuanced velocity by the time the key hits the<br/>bottom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I am a keyboard player and the feel of the Terpstra was really<br/>exceptional and had very expressive touch that was lighter but much like<br/>a real piano, only faster.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Every key is easily re-mappable and if mapped to a continuous<br/>controller, then slowly depressing any re-mapped key sends out<br/>continuous data like a fader in real time. It does all of this with no<br/>latency.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Upon seeing it, I could immediately appreciate the manufacturing<br/>quality of this prototype &iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot; well made thick aluminum case with a<br/>look and solidity that is reminiscent of Apple G5 and 8-core towers.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keyboards take a huge amount of abuse during live performance. This<br/>one is a precision machine built like a tank; it can withstand the<br/>constant pounding of an energetic concert performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This innovative and quality controller has a key layout that, unlike<br/>the Bosanquet, Jank&Atilde;&sup3; and other generalized/isomorphic keyboards,<br/>puts each key at a slightly different height &iuml;&iquest;&half;&quot; which when combined<br/>with the irregular shape of the front row of keys, allows you to feel<br/>where your hands are on the keys without looking. This means that for<br/>the first time you can play a matrix keyboard without having to<br/>constantly look at it to know where you are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I would LOVE to map some keys to sweep filters, and leave other keys<br/>as notes to trigger the sounds feeding through the filter. This WOULD be<br/>the funkiest microtonal thing ever!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The product designers who built the only 2 working prototypes are<br/>ready to take a 20-pieces order. The first one is mine, so there are 19<br/>&quot;available&quot;. The culprit is, it cannot go into production unless there<br/>are at least 20 buyers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Price: 2189 USD / 1789 EUR<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alternatives:<br/>&gt; C-Thru Music Axis 64 - 2312 USD / 1887 EUR<br/>&gt; Opal Gecko - 3749 USD / 3060 EUR<br/>&gt; StarrLabs MicroZone U-648 - 8995 USD / 7365 EUR<br/>&gt;</p></div>
