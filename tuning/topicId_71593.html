There seems to be a used copy on sale at Amazon<br/>for $859 (!!), but I can&apos;t afford that. Is there any cheaper way for<br/>me to hear this piece of music, even once??</p><p>If anyone has a digital copy they&apos;re willing to share with me, email<br/>me off-list at <a href="mailto:keenanpepper@removethis.gmail.andthis.com">keenanpepper@removethis.gmail.andthis.com</a>. I have some<br/>rare-ish things I&apos;m willing to trade for it.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
