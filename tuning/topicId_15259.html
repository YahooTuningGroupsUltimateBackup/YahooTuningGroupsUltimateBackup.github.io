Margo, can you think<br/>&gt; of a way of incorporating a chord like this into the neo-Gothic<br/>&gt; language?</p><p>Please let me emphasize, Paul, how much I love this kind of creative<br/>question which at once engages the musical imagination and raises<br/>issues about the &quot;stylistic bounds&quot; of a given genre. Maybe if we<br/>compare usual Gothic/neo-Gothic styles to tertian music of the 18th<br/>and 19th centuries, your sonority places us in a situation a bit<br/>analogous to modern jazz with its complex sonorities of the ninth and<br/>eleventh, etc.</p><p>How can a new sonority be integrated into an established musical<br/>vocabulary and cadential &quot;grammar&quot; -- or, at what point does the<br/>process really lead us into a somewhat different langauge?</p><p>An important point: the &quot;neo-Gothic language&quot; as I tend to define it<br/>is only one possible viewpoint on what &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; what be; and the<br/>fact that a given idiom might be outside the usual &quot;neo-Gothic&quot;<br/>category as I or anyone else may define it doesn&apos;t make that idiom<br/>less beautiful. It may or may not be &quot;cricket,&quot; but if not, maybe it&apos;s<br/>championship baseball or soccer.</p><p>Something like A3-E4-G4-B4-Eb5 (using MIDI notation with C4 as middle<br/>C), when I first saw it in your message, looked more complex than what<br/>I would associate with &quot;neo-Gothic,&quot; which usually involves up to four<br/>voices (three or four being standard in the 13th and 14th centuries),<br/>and actually hearing it in 22-tET confirmed that it is more &quot;complex&quot;<br/>or &quot;dissonant&quot; than anything I&apos;m accustomed to. That, of course,<br/>doesn&apos;t make it &quot;wrong,&quot; only &quot;very strange for this idiom as I know<br/>it.&quot;</p><p>Before considering a possible way of handling all five notes, I might<br/>share a very intriguing progression which gets as far as including the<br/>lowest four, A3-E4-G4-B4, and which I find a strikingly &quot;xenharmonic&quot;<br/>and beautiful variation on a usual cadence:</p><p>      B4  Bb4<br/>      G4  F4<br/>      E4  F4<br/>      A3  Bb3</p><p>(m7-5 + m3-1 + M9-8)</p><p>Thank you so much for setting a problem which gave me the opportunity<br/>to discover this progression, beautiful not only in 22-tET but also in<br/>usual Pythagorean, and I suspect likely in just about any neo-Gothic<br/>tuning. Here the parenthetical notation, for people who may be<br/>unfamiliar with it, shows two-voice resolutions by contrary motion<br/>from unstable intervals to stable ones.</p><p>The lower three voices are standard: a minor seventh sonority, or<br/>three voices of a complete contractive quad (A3-C4-E4-G4), resolving<br/>here in an intensive manner (ascending semitonal motion) to the fifth<br/>Bb3-F4. In 22-tET, as you note, this is a nice approximation of 4:6:7,<br/>and I discuss this kind of cadential intonation more in my upcoming<br/>article on &quot;flavors.&quot;</p><p>We might describe the added B4, the major ninth above the lowest<br/>voice, as what some jazz musicians at least call a &quot;tension&quot;: it adds<br/>to the complexity of the seventh sonority without being a &quot;usual&quot; part<br/>of it.</p><p>Note that if we omit the seventh above the lowest voice G3, then we<br/>have A3-E4-B4, a usual and relatively concordant 4:6:9. Thus _either_<br/>4:6:7 or 4:6:9 is routine neo-Gothic; it&apos;s the superimposition of the<br/>two, 4:6:7:9, which is &quot;xeno&quot; for this style.</p><p>However, that ninth A3-B4 _does_ permit a resolution which fits in<br/>with the usual cadence in the lowest three voices: like the minor<br/>seventh (m7-5) and minor third (m3-1), it can also resolve by a kind<br/>of stepwise contrary motion: to the outer octave of the complete trine<br/>Bb3-F4-Bb4, with one of its voices moving by a diatonic semitone or<br/>limma A3-Bb3 and the other by a chromatic semitone or apotome B4-Bb4!</p><p>In 22-tET, where the limma is 1/4-tone and the apotome 3/4-tone, the<br/>contrast of these motions may be especially striking; I like it also<br/>in Pythagorean.</p><p>Note that with A3-E4-B4 alone, we could have a typical resolution by<br/>contrary motion like this, with usual diatonic intervals:</p><p>B4  G4    B4  G4    B4  C4<br/>E4  G4    E4  C4    E4  F4<br/>A3  C4    A3  C4    A3  F3</p><p>(M9-5)    (M9-5)    (M9-12)</p><p>The first two options are identical except for the partwriting in the<br/>middle voice, with the outer ninth contracting to a fifth; in the<br/>third option, this interval expands to a twelfth by &quot;near-conjunct&quot;<br/>contrary motion (stepwise in one voice, thirdwise in the other).</p><p>Another medieval alternative, even more common, is an oblique<br/>resolution in which the ninth simply moves by step to the octave of a<br/>complete trine:</p><p>B4 A4<br/>E3<br/>A3</p><p>M9-8<br/>5</p><p>However, as the resolution of A3-E4-G4-B4 shows, a major ninth _can_<br/>resolve by stepwise contrary motion to an octave as well, and this is<br/>the kind of chromatic progression that Marchettus of Padua might have<br/>come up with (he has a major sixth similarly resolving to a fifth).</p><p>Really, thank you for the gift of such a wonderful four-voice cadence:<br/>all I had to do was resolve the lower three voices as usual, and let<br/>the fourth voice move so as to complete the trine.</p><p>Now for the full five voices. While this goes beyond what I would call<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic,&quot; one solution would be like this, with the same<br/>progression in the lower four voices, with the Eb5 held over and then<br/>resolving from eleventh to twelfth above the lowest part:</p><p>Eb5     F5<br/>B4  Bb4<br/>G4  F4<br/>E4  F4<br/>A3  Bb3</p><p>Of course, if we agree that in a &quot;neo-neo-Gothic&quot; style with<br/>sonorities this complex, something like Bb3-F4-F4-Bb4-Eb5 or 6:9:12:16<br/>might be considered stable, then we could consider this sonority as<br/>the resolution without a need for further movement of the highest<br/>voice.</p><p>Having voices remain stationary at a cadence (other than a sustained<br/>note or &quot;pedal point&quot; in certain styles) is less typical in Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic music than stepwise or thirdwise motion in all voices, but<br/>it does happen in some conventional progressions, so why not here,<br/>too?</p><p>By the way, with unstable sonorities more conventionally neo-Gothic or<br/>less complex than this, I would say that if we want to have stable<br/>sonorities going beyond the complete trine (2:3:4), then after 1:3:9<br/>or 1:6:9, my choice would be 6:8:9, 8:9:12, 4:6:9, or 9:12:16.</p><p>A small aside: it&apos;s interesting that in 22-tET, your 4:6:7:9:11 indeed<br/>has an outer interval very close to 4:11 (~1745 cents, around 6 cents<br/>narrow); the 9:11, in contrast, is somewhat ambiguous at around 327<br/>cents (B4-Eb5), a diminished fourth which I might describe as<br/>somewhere between 6:5 (a kind of &quot;schisma third&quot;) and 17:14. With<br/>something like 29-tET, where an augmented second of 8/29 octave is<br/>around 331 cents, I&apos;d call it a gentle 17:14.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for setting a problem which, in its lower four-voice<br/>subset, practically &quot;solves itself&quot; in a really beautiful way, and<br/>enriches the neo-Gothic vocabulary in a fashion I might not have<br/>considered.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
