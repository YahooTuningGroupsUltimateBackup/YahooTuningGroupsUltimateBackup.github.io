(Scroll down to around the middle of the page to find<br/>it.) This includes 15, 37, 59, 22, 51, and 29-TET (although 51 is<br/>inconsistent in the 5-limit, so its existence on the list is questionable,<br/>but it fills a gap between 29 and 22).</p><p>I noticed that Porcupine temperament has the unusual property that the<br/>canon scale (a warped diatonic scale) has three sizes of steps, with the<br/>middle step halfway between the large and the small step. Other scales<br/>having three step sizes usually have the middle step closer to the large<br/>step: the small step is a semitone and the other two steps are different<br/>sizes of whole tones.</p><p>I also added retuned versions of the progression from the end of the<br/>Mizarian Porcupine Overture in these tunings, to illustrate how the 250:243<br/>vanishes. For fun, try the 12-TET version!</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
