News, there was an article<br/>about a merger involving Clear Channel Communications, and SFX<br/>Concerts...it said SFX is the &quot;nation&apos;s biggest concert promoter,&quot; and<br/>CCC owns &quot;867 radio stations, 19 television stations, and 550,000<br/>billboards...&quot;  Yow...it just got me to thinking about the very poor<br/>state of art in America (and probably lots of other places as well).<br/>From my listening experiences, there&apos;s not much creative, profound, or<br/>innovative happening on the radio these days...it seems like a few very<br/>powerful folks are deciding what gets played on an awful lot of media<br/>outlets. What is (perversely) fascinating about the situation is this:<br/>why do these people seem to like the worst in music and art? Why, for<br/>instance, couldn&apos;t they just as easily like music/art with deep and<br/>valid meaning, art that could easily change the very climate of today&apos;s<br/>world?  I don&apos;t mean to offend anyone here, but in my many years of<br/>playing gigs, I have found that the richest people usually have the<br/>cheapest (maybe narrow is a better word?) taste in music (art in<br/>general?)...I would be happy to be proved wrong, but the upper crust<br/>seems to be a rather shallow place, artistically. Wouldn&apos;t it be neat if<br/>Clear Channel Communication decided to promote microtonal music? Why<br/>not? Think it could happen? For that matter, I&apos;d love it if one could<br/>hear music from all over the world on the radio, instead of the thickly<br/>processed and homogenized American cheese we are constantly exposed<br/>to... I&apos;d love to listen to an Indian raga or Turkish maqam or Norwegian<br/>folk song or African village chant while stuck in rush hour...(and I<br/>know I can on tape). Just why ARE things so whacked out in the arts? It<br/>doesn&apos;t make any sense to me...Hstick</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@apple.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2000 11:25:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah, another icky merger that will further homogenize America... Neil said it...</p><p>&gt; From my listening experiences, there&apos;s not much creative,<br/>&gt; profound, or innovative happening on the radio these days...</p><p>(Yeah, that&apos;s why I gave up on it!)  ... and ...</p><p>&gt; Just why ARE things so whacked out in the arts?</p><p>These are more comments on the state of the country than on art itself.<br/>There&apos;s a great interview article with Frank Zappa from the 80s where he says<br/>essentially the same thing -- the really innovative or profound or<br/>intellecctual stuff just DOES NOT SELL.  It is partly the fault of several<br/>generations of &quot;academic&quot; composers and partly the fault of those who hold<br/>the means of producing &amp; disseminating &quot;art&quot; -- who only have tastes that are<br/>on par with the public anyway.</p><p>In the era of the Internet, I think we have a lot more potential at least<br/>for getting microtonal stuff available -- e.g., being able to put up MP3<br/>files on Tuning Punks, etc.  For the avant gardists and others with &quot;no<br/>commercial potential&quot;, we should be at the beginning of a golden age...</p><p>&gt; it seems like a few very powerful folks are deciding what gets<br/>&gt; played on an awful lot of media outlets.</p><p>That has been the case in all of recorded history, so it&apos;s not new.  What is<br/>new is that producers of art who DON&apos;T have power &amp; money &amp; popular<br/>influence are now more capable than ever of at least PRODUCING their work in<br/>a form that can be made available to the general public more easily than ever<br/>before.</p><p>&gt; the richest people usually have the cheapest (maybe narrow is<br/>&gt; a better word?) taste in music (art in general?)</p><p>This is a comment that I think is much more valid for the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;<br/>than for the old monied rich.  Cheap taste goes with new money; &quot;narrow&quot;<br/>taste goes with money.  The phenomenon I think has to do with a gneral<br/>conservatism in all things, including art.</p><p>For middle America to discover &quot;microtonal&quot;, it will have to be made &quot;cool<br/>and chic&quot; by some charismatic big-star of the stage or screen.  That&apos;s how<br/>things work -- people (in general) are led to new hip phenomena by people who<br/>are already thought to be hip.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2000 10:16:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt; From my listening experiences, there&apos;s not much creative, profound, or<br/>&gt; innovative happening on the radio these days...</p><p>In the New York area we&apos;ve got it good.
