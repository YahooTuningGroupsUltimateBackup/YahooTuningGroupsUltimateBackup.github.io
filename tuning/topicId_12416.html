If you can do<br/>it for less, I&apos;d like to see it!</p><p>&gt;I find Margo&apos;s idea&apos;s about using 2 midi manuals to be much more<br/>&gt;cost efficient</p><p>Not to mention completely limiting.  Organs and harpsichords have<br/>had multiple manuals for hundreds of years, yet I know of no serious<br/>microtonal work ever done in this manner.  Can you play chords<br/>across manuals 1-handed, for instance?  What if I split your favorite<br/>piano keyboard into seperate 7- and 5-tone manuals.  How would you<br/>like that?</p><p>&gt;and besides your not in danger of losing years of acquired keyboard<br/>&gt;skills with this method.</p><p>What kind of skill is it that can you loose by learning a new one?<br/>I&apos;d like to know.  This rampant fear of new keyboards is pure mind<br/>fungus (and not the good kind, either!).</p><p>&gt;Has anyone on this list actually played these Starr Labs boards, or<br/>&gt;better yet do you know of anyone that has composed music on one that<br/>&gt;may be able to tell us what the transition to this Bosanquet keyboard<br/>&gt;was like? Monz? What was it like for you when you played it? I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;seen you play keyboards before, and you&apos;ve got skills - how&apos;d it feel<br/>&gt;to you? Surely there would be a bit of a learning curve - and<br/>&gt;especially when it would come to setting up mappings.</p><p>I&apos;ve had the chance to play only one generalized keyboard, and that<br/>only briefly, and I didn&apos;t like it, because it had Wilson&apos;s hexagonal<br/>keys (as does the Uath), and I prefer rectangular keys.  However, the<br/>harpsichord I played had tiered ranks, which is great for rectangular<br/>but bad for hexagonal.  I have reason to believe the planar layout of<br/>the Uath suits its hexagonal keys far better.</p><p>The other key thing about the Uath is the action.  When I tried the<br/>&quot;mute&quot; prototype in 1998, the action travel was .008&quot;.  Which is a<br/>great idea, with the polyphonic aftertouch Starr has planned.  His<br/>aftertouch mechanism is simply awesome.  But if I understood the web<br/>site, poly touch isn&apos;t available just yet.  I wouldn&apos;t get the<br/>board without it.</p><p>&gt;Got to admit, it does look really cool!! If only money were no<br/>&gt;object.</p><p>Do you play keyboard?  Have you looked at the price of pianos lately?<br/>Yes, it&apos;s expensive.  No, I can&apos;t afford it today either.  But<br/>musical instruments are expensive, and one day, I just may buy it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 7:04:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s all fine and good, but considering what Mr. Starr has done,<br/>&gt; I think $7500 is a fine price, and I can&apos;t understand why everybody<br/>&gt; around here seems to have such a hard time with it.

Hexagons<br/>pack in such a way that there&apos;s no space between adjacent keys on a given<br/>rank, so you can&apos;t do this, and that cuts out a lot of action.  The<br/>problem is exacerbated on multi-tier boards, since the ranks in front of<br/>you trap your fingers, keeping them curled.  That&apos;s damn annoying.  The<br/>flat-plane design of the Uath relieves some of that, but it&apos;s still<br/>important to remember that fingertips do not fall on a line.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The other key thing about the Uath is the action.

I&apos;m told it&apos;s damn hard to build poly touch with so many keys<br/>so close together as on the Uath...  Or did you mean how I would use<br/>the aftertouch?  The obvious thing is a slight pitch bend, for bebung<br/>as on a clavichord.  But I&apos;d map it to something like relative amplitudes<br/>of even/odd partials on my additive synth, or better yet a mistuning<br/>of the higher partials of a patch, like what happens during the attack<br/>on percussion instruments (like the piano).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 6:52:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The<br/>&gt; problem is exacerbated on multi-tier boards, since the ranks in<br/>front of<br/>&gt; you trap your fingers, keeping them curled.
