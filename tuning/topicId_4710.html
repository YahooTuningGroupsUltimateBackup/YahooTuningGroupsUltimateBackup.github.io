At the same time, I would like to suggest<br/>a category which may describe both Renaissance meantone (specifically<br/>the 1/4-comma variety) and my other favorite tuning, medieval<br/>Pythagorean: linear or selective JI.</p><p>Please let me dedicate this article especially to Bill Alves, who has<br/>inspired me both by his fine paper on Nicola Vicentino (with its<br/>discussion of pragmatism in tuning), and by his many contributions to<br/>this list. Of course, the responsibility for the predictable quirks<br/>and possible errors here remain solely mine.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>1. Setting the context: live keyboard playing<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>In defining the question of Renaissance meantone or 5-limit JI under<br/>the rather narrow circumstances under which I am currently addressing<br/>it, I would like not to limit others to the same perspective, but<br/>indeed to invite a discussion of factors (involving both the nature of<br/>the performance and technology, and the orientation of the performer)<br/>which might lead to radically different conclusions.</p><p>The rather specific circumstances which I address are playing music in<br/>16th-century styles (from the routine to the most &quot;experimental&quot;) on a<br/>TX-802 synthesizer supporting two conventional 12-note-per-octave MIDI<br/>keyboards (technically speaking, &quot;MIDI controller keyboards&quot;) with 49<br/>keys (four conventional octaves) each.</p><p>Commonly I use the two keyboards as contrasting manuals, maybe playing<br/>two voices of a four-voice texture on each manual. For example, in an<br/>&quot;organ&quot; style, one manual might have a conventional &quot;organ-like&quot;<br/>sound, and the other a &quot;crumhorn-like&quot; or &quot;regal-like&quot; sound --<br/>crumhorns and regal (reed) organs having a distinctive &quot;buzzy&quot;<br/>sound. In a &quot;harpsichord&quot; style, one manual might have a fuller<br/>harpsichord-like sound, the other an effect more like a lute stop.</p><p>Using the &quot;part-tuning&quot; feature, it is easy to tune each manual (or,<br/>more precisely, the &quot;instrument(s)&quot; mapped to it) to a different<br/>arrangement of the same tuning: for example, 1/4-comma meantone in<br/>Eb-G# for the lower manual, and F-A# for the upper manual. This<br/>example happens to be the actual 14-note tuning I use in practicing<br/>the Prologue of Orlando di Lasso&apos;s _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_.</p><p>Thus options range from a standard 12-note tuning with all notes on<br/>the two manuals in unison, to a 24-note tuning where none of the notes<br/>are in unison -- assuming that each keyboard has repeating 12-note<br/>octaves. The TX-802 synthesizer itself does _not_ impose such an<br/>assumption, which may result more from my &quot;conventionality,&quot; or<br/>limited keyboard skills in coping with even a standard layout &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Since my main practical and theoretical orientation is to medieval and<br/>Renaissance music, notes outside of the typical Eb-G# range seem<br/>&quot;unusual&quot; to me -- so a bit of extra effort to use these &quot;special&quot;<br/>notes on a keyboard is for me rather expected. In contrast, I regard<br/>the notes of the standard medieval/Renaissance gamut, the seven<br/>diatonic notes plus Bb (also an integral part of this gamut, or<br/>_musica recta_), as &quot;home.&quot; The other &quot;routine&quot; accidentals -- Eb, F#,<br/>C#, G# -- are for me somewhere in between.</p><p>As stated at the beginning of this section, my purpose is to suggest<br/>some of the circumstances in either the technological setting of the<br/>performance or the orientational &quot;set&quot; of the performer which might<br/>lead to a different viewpoint on the &quot;Renaissance meantone or JI&quot;<br/>question than that I am about to express.</p><p>For example, how about a performer using software to obtain a just<br/>tuning &quot;on the fly&quot;? How about a performer who routinely plays pieces<br/>using all kinds of signatures with multiple sharps and flats, or who<br/>uses some method other than live performance to realize Renaissance<br/>music in an historical tuning (be it meantone or 5-limit JI)?</p><p>Also, of course, how about a performer using non-standard keyboards<br/>designed to support more than 12 notes per octave, and maybe even with<br/>a layout especially modelled for JI?</p><p>Anyway, having announced some of my circumstances and predilections, I<br/>would like to consider first two factors which might make me lean<br/>toward meantone, and then a curious kinship between 1/4-comma meantone<br/>and Pythagorean tuning in relation to the &quot;JI&quot; phenomenon.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Meantone attractions: WYSIWYG and safety &quot;at home&quot;<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>For an advocate of meantone in a Renaissance context, one line of<br/>argument might be to invoke a principle associated with the UNIX<br/>operating system: &quot;When you get 90% of the benefit for 10% of the<br/>effort, a compromise may be a good thing.&quot;</p><p>However, meantone as well as 5-limit JI can involve nontrivial<br/>complications for Renaissance music, specifically experimental music<br/>such as the extended chromaticism of Lasso or even the enharmonicism<br/>of Vicentino.[2] In either tuning system, for such music we must in one<br/>way or another step beyond the usual 12 notes per octave.</p><p>To explain why the complications of a meantone tuning beyond 12 notes<br/>seem &quot;natural&quot; to me, while 5-limit JI seems &quot;gratuitously difficult,&quot;<br/>I might focus on two personal preferences, the first of which I<br/>humorously call WYSIWYG (&quot;What You Spell Is What You Get&quot;), and the<br/>second, &quot;safety at home among the _musica recta_ notes.&quot;</p><p>By WYSIWYG, in a &quot;meantone vs. 5-limit JI&quot; context, I mean the<br/>principle that intervals normally spelled as concords should actually<br/>sound as concords on the keyboard. That is, for example, D-A should be<br/>a concordant fifth -- but G#-Eb or C#-F, a diminished sixth and<br/>diminished fourth respectively, need not provide an acceptable fifth<br/>or major third respectively, a result hardly advertised by their<br/>spellings.[3]</p><p>Another side of this preference is the principle of &quot;safety at home&quot;<br/>-- that is, among the _musica recta_ notes (diatonic notes plus Bb)<br/>there should not be unpleasant &quot;surprises&quot; such as a D-A Wolf fifth.<br/>Such exciting complications are to be expected as one adventures<br/>beyond Eb or G# -- but hardly when a playing an interval which<br/>continually occurs in almost any mode.[4]</p><p>From a practical view, of course, I might observe that D-A comes up in<br/>Renaissance music far more frequently than an Ab or D#, let alone one<br/>of Vicentino&apos;s intriguing enharmonic steps beyond the first 19 notes<br/>of 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tet.</p><p>The &quot;manual choreography&quot; of playing a 14-note meantone scheme on two<br/>12-note keyboards requires some planning, but the complications<br/>reinforce the sense of playing an audacious piece, sharing in a way in<br/>the composer&apos;s adventure. Negotiating an experimental piece by Lasso,<br/>like climbing a mountain or journeying into space, may require some<br/>&quot;special gear.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, a Wolf fifth at D-A feels like a booby trap in my own<br/>livingroom. Each time the interval comes up -- as the final of Dorian,<br/>and in a cadential role at final or internal cadences in other modes<br/>-- I must be sure in 5-limit JI to play all D&apos;s on the right keyboard.</p><p>One might say that with meantone, the tuning tends for me to reinforce<br/>a certain worldview of musical &quot;distance&quot; and &quot;adventure&quot;: _musica<br/>recta_ is safe home territory, a secure base from which to venture out<br/>into chromatic or even enharmonic spaces. Further, the keyboard<br/>reflects the note spellings on the page: G# and Ab are two notes (as<br/>advertised), while D is a single note which can be trusted to form a<br/>concordant fifth D-A.</p><p>This raises a question, of course, of how musicians from different<br/>backgrounds and tuning perspectives might define an &quot;adventurous&quot;<br/>interval or composition. For someone coming from a background of<br/>playing 18th-19th century music in all 12 keys -- as opposed to<br/>Renaissance music with its 12 modes -- the idea of _musica recta_ and<br/>_musica ficta_ notes might be more of a historical curiosity than an<br/>everyday worldview. A Wolf at G#-Eb might seem just as much an<br/>&quot;unwelcome&quot; complication as one at D-A.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Pythagorean/meantone affinities: linear or selective JI?<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Interestingly, Renaissance meantone in its 1/4-comma version (with<br/>pure major thirds at 5:4) shares the attractions (for me) of WYSIWYG<br/>and safety at home with my other favorite tuning system: medieval<br/>Pythagorean, or 3-limit JI.</p><p>In Pythagorean, as in meantone, What You Spell Is What You Get: D-A is<br/>a concordant (and indeed pure) fifth, while G#-Eb is, as advertised, a<br/>diminished sixth. The _musica recta_ notes are safe, with &quot;adventure&quot;<br/>agreeably reserved for the territory beyond the usual Eb-G# range<br/>which some experimental pieces do explore.</p><p>From a structural or analytical viewpoint, these tunings share a style<br/>which I might call &quot;linear JI&quot;: the choicest concord of the system is<br/>made pure and beatless (a 3:2 fifth in Pythagorean, a 5:4 major third<br/>in 1/4-comma meantone), but other intervals (apart from the 2:1<br/>octave) are tuned &quot;up the line,&quot; as it were, with all regular fifths<br/>having the same size.</p><p>In Pythagorean, of course, these fifths are themselves the prime<br/>concords to be made pure; in 1/4-comma meantone, each fifth is<br/>tempered or narrowed 1/4 syntonic comma so as to achieve pure major<br/>thirds. In each case, the other, &quot;non-choice&quot; intervals fall into<br/>place.</p><p>To describe this approach of tuning &quot;up the line&quot; based on the ratio<br/>of a single pure concord (plus the octave, of course), I suggest the<br/>term &quot;linear JI.&quot; Here I am indebted to Paul Erlich -- if I have the<br/>attribution correct -- who replied to my question on this Tuning<br/>List about a &quot;JI lattice&quot; for Pythagorean by saying that it would be<br/>simply a line.</p><p>In the case of Pythagorean, we have a tuning which is not only<br/>&quot;linear&quot; but also &quot;3-limit JI&quot; in a traditional sense: not only the<br/>choicest concords of medieval polyphony (fifths at 3:2), but all<br/>_simpler_ concords (octaves at 2:1, and unisons at 1:1), are just.<br/>Further, of course, all stable and unstable intervals in Pythagorean<br/>are derived as integer ratios, another hallmark of traditional JI.</p><p>With 1/4-comma meantone, however, we do _not_ have &quot;JI&quot; in this sense,<br/>because while the choice major thirds at 5:4 are pure, the simplier<br/>fifths are not (being 1/4 comma or ~5.38 cents narrower than 3:2) --<br/>and apart from the major thirds and octaves, all intervals are<br/>tempered, having irrational ratios.</p><p>However, the term &quot;selective JI&quot; might communicate this kind of<br/>arrangement, where the _choicest_ concord is indeed pure, but other<br/>concords participating in stable sonorities (here the minor third, as<br/>well as the fifth and fourth) are impure or tempered.</p><p>Following this proposed typology, Pythagorean or 3-limit is the one<br/>traditional JI system which is also linear, being based, aside from<br/>octaves, on a single line of pure 3:2 fifths.</p><p>In contrast, 1/4-comma meantone is not only linear (deriving from a<br/>line of 5:4 major thirds) but &quot;selective,&quot; because the simpler stable<br/>concord of the fifth as well as the complementary concord of the minor<br/>third are neither pure nor based on integer ratios.</p><p>While applying the term &quot;linear and selective JI&quot; to a tuning such as<br/>1/4-comma meantone with mostly tempered intervals may seem a rather<br/>free poetic license, I would urge that this term might be more<br/>descriptive than &quot;non-just, non-equal, tuning.&quot; Above all, the fact<br/>that the beloved 5:4 major thirds _are_ pure seems to me worthy of<br/>notice, as well as the way that this &quot;natural&quot; landmark on the<br/>meantone spectrum serves as an attractant for the tuning.</p><p>---------------------<br/>5. Lines and lattices<br/>---------------------</p><p>Traditionally, &quot;JI&quot; has tended to mean a system where all stable<br/>concords are pure or beatless, and where all intervals are derived<br/>from integer ratios.</p><p>Here I would like to propose as one variant a looser interpretation<br/>holding simply: &quot;The choicest concord in a given system of polyphony<br/>should be pure.&quot; Both Pythagorean and 1/4-comma meantone are tuning<br/>systems based on the &quot;loose JI principle&quot; in this sense, with<br/>Pythagorean (3-limit) additionally meeting the classical test.</p><p>From a theoretical and practical viewpoint, the &quot;linear&quot; quality of<br/>both Pythagorean and 1/4-comma meantone stands in contrast to the<br/>intricate lattices of 5-limit, 7-limit, and higher JI systems. One<br/>might ask what musical or cultural ramifications -- tuning theory<br/>being also a kind of culture -- stem from this choice of line or<br/>lattice as the realization of a quest for pure concords.</p><p>Also, might the recent theoretical viewpoint describing Pythagorean<br/>as &quot;zero-comma meantone&quot; be something more than an ingenious<br/>contradiction of historical common sense, which defines meantone<br/>precisely as the compromising of fifths for the sake of more blending<br/>thirds? Might this terminology point to the simplicity of a tuning &quot;up<br/>the line,&quot; as contrasted to the intricacies and delicacies of a<br/>5-limit or higher lattice for classic JI?</p><p>From this point of view, both 0-comma meantone (classic 3-limit, pure<br/>fifths) and 1/4-comma (selective 5-limit, pure major thirds) mark<br/>points where the meantone spectrum intersects with the world of &quot;JI.&quot;</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>6. Linear JI: beatlessness and beatfulness<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>From a musical point of view, linear JI systems (classic 3-limit, and<br/>1/4-comma meantone or selective 5-limit) involve a mixture of<br/>beatlessness and beatfulness.</p><p>In Pythagorean, the stable medieval concords and the complete<br/>three-voice harmony of the trine (outer octave, lower fifth, upper<br/>fourth, e.g. D3-A3-D4) are of course beatless, while unstable<br/>sonorities involving intervals such as 81:64 major thirds or 32:27<br/>minor thirds are &quot;beatful.&quot; Here I use a MIDI-style notation where<br/>middle C is C4, and higher numbers represent higher octaves.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone, stable Renaissance combinations dividing a<br/>fifth into two adjacent thirds (e.g. F3-A3-C4) mix a beatless major<br/>third with a mildly beatful minor third and a somewhat more<br/>prominently beatful fifth -- the latter two intervals both tempered by<br/>~5.38 cents, but the fifth generally considered to be more sensitive<br/>to such a narrowing.</p><p>A number of 16th-century keyboard pieces end on a sonority with the<br/>major third but without the fifth, e.g. D2-D3-F#3-D4. Might the<br/>omission of the fifth (which Vicentino and Zarlino teach is required<br/>along with the third for complete or perfect harmony) represent a<br/>choice to conclude with a beatless sonority (at least in a 1/4-comma<br/>tuning)?</p><p>In other settings, curiously, I somehow find that meantone fifths seem<br/>to add to the flavor of much Renaissance music, such as Spanish pieces<br/>around 1500 (e.g. Juan del Encinas) where it is still common to begin<br/>and end on a sonority of octave, fifth, and upper fourth -- thirds<br/>being still in the process of getting established as concluding<br/>intervals. For buoyant, dancelike, pieces, the beating of those fifths<br/>seems to add to liveliness of the music, and to introduce a kind of<br/>acoustical paradox: the more perfectly concordant fifths are less pure<br/>than the more imperfect (and now pervasive) major thirds.[5]</p><p>Maybe this kind of contrast around 1500, in the early meantone period,<br/>is a kind of balance or obverse face to medieval Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>In conclusion, I wonder if &quot;partly beatless and partly beatful&quot;<br/>tunings, including Renaissance 1/4-comma meantone and medieval<br/>Pythagorean or 3-limit JI, might be a useful category.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. This question has been debated since Renaissance times, with<br/>Vicentino and Zarlino leaning toward meantone temperament (although<br/>the latter also describes a 5-limit JI keyboard), and Salinas<br/>reportedly favoring a 24-note JI system. Today this debate, as<br/>directed to the playing of Renaissance music on keyboards, might<br/>include the issue of &quot;authenticity&quot;: does the evident prevalence of<br/>meantone in the 16th century make it more &quot;period-appropriate&quot;? Or<br/>might one argue that, at least when realizing vocal music of the<br/>period, keyboards should approach the Renaissance vocal ideal of<br/>5-limit JI as closely as technology permits, an argument advanced by<br/>the presence (however uncommon) of JI keyboards in the 16th century<br/>itself? Are the alternating 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones of 5-limit JI to<br/>be considered a melodic refinement, or a compromise of what some<br/>current theorists call an ideal of &quot;melodic consonance&quot; in which<br/>similar intervals of a scale should preferably have the same tuning?<br/>At least one Renaissance theorist, Giovanni Battista Benedetti, also<br/>raises the question of &quot;pitch drift&quot; because of cumulative comma<br/>adjustments, a topic addressed by Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;adaptive JI.&quot; A<br/>discussion might touch on these and other issues.</p><p>2. Here it may be noted that much audacious chromaticism is quite<br/>possible within a standard 12-note meantone range such as Eb-G#, as<br/>Easley Blackwood points out.</p><p>3. An advocate of 5-limit JI might very fairly observe, of course,<br/>that just as &quot;form follows function,&quot; so should musical spellings. If<br/>one wishes to achieve pure fifths as well as pure major thirds in<br/>Renaissance music, then the distinction between &quot;D0&quot; and &quot;D-1&quot; (using<br/>whatever numbering system is desired to show syntonic commas) might be<br/>considered no more &quot;artificial&quot; than that between Eb and D#.</p><p>4. With either Pythagorean or meantone, I tend to regard the step from<br/>16 notes per octave to 17 as a significant leap, because adding A#<br/>means that one of the keyboards is without a Bb, a _musica recta_<br/>note. Psychologically, however, this complication is compensated for<br/>by a sense of &quot;high adventure&quot; -- after all, A# is an outer limit of<br/>the 17-note Pythagorean schemes proposed in the early 15th century.<br/>As mentioned above, A# can also occur in some Renaissance pieces using<br/>fewer than 17 notes, e.g. Lasso&apos;s Prologue to the _Prophetiae<br/>Sibyllarum_ which uses the standard Eb-G# plus D# and A#.</p><p>5. However, a 5-limit JI advocate might point out that such<br/>four-voice ensemble pieces were likely performed mostly by singers and<br/>players of non-fixed-pitched instruments, where the technical factors<br/>prompting a meantone solution for keyboards would not apply.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

This tuning is not linear but planar, though, since the vanishing of the<br/>225:224 reduces the dimensionality of the 3-5-7 lattice down from three to<br/>two, much like the vanishing of the 81:80 comma in meantone reduces the<br/>dimensionality of the 3-5 lattice from two to one.</p><p>In my decatonic framework, points of intersection with JI occur using fifths<br/>augmented by 1/3 of a septimal comma (711.0430 cents) (three fourths give a<br/>pure 7:6), fifths augmented by 1/4 of a septimal comma (708.7710 cents)<br/>(four fifths give a pure 9:7). These are not linear but &quot;bilinear&quot; tunings<br/>since an additional chain of fifths a half-octave away is required to get<br/>the ratios of 5. More radically, one can use fifths augmented by 1/2 of a<br/>septimal comma (715.5870 cents) (two fourths give a pure 7:4), but even if<br/>one can tolerate such fifths, the decatonic 6:5 comes out a whoipping 31<br/>cents sharp.</p><p>Margo, I view meantone not as a system favoring the major third above all<br/>other intervals but one where all 5-limit consonances are valued and a<br/>compromise is reached considering all of them. Becuase the major third is<br/>pure at an intermediate point in the meantone spectrum relative to the<br/>points where the fifth is pure and where the minor third is pure, the<br/>overall tuning of the three intervals suffers least where the major third is<br/>pure, or closer to that point than to either of the other two points.</p><p>Similarly, in decatonic tuning it is not the 7:4 that should be favored over<br/>all other 7-limit consonances, but the overall result on all of them that<br/>should determine the amount of tempering of the fifth.
