Imagine that<br/>&gt;for every note played in a tune, the harmonic partials are tailored<br/>&gt;for that moment in the instrument. This means the timbre of an<br/>&gt;instrument would evolve throughout the tune according to what chords<br/>&gt;are playing at the time. This would be incredibly unfeasible and<br/>&gt;impractical, but maybe the best music would actually do this - who<br/>&gt;knows!</p><p>I think the &quot;unfeasible and impractical&quot; part of this is premature.<br/>In fact, there&apos;s a pretty easy way to do this electronically.<br/>First, define a set of frequencies from which all the partials<br/>of all the notes will be drawn, and assign them to the various<br/>keys of a keyboard. Make each key sound a sine wave (so that you are<br/>building up a &quot;note&quot; by playing its partials directly).<br/>Then you can easily play &quot;in tune&quot; (in whatever sense you choose)<br/>tailoring the partials from moment to moment.</p><p>This strategy was employed in the &quot;Duet for Morphine and Cymbols&quot;,<br/>which you can hear at:</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/Morphine_and_Crystal.mp3">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/Morphine_and_Crystal.mp3</a></p><p>Of course, I did not use harmonic partials, but chose a set more<br/>to my liking.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
