I just saw Buddy Guy play, and he is living proof that<br/>the &quot;blues scale&quot; is just a convenient starting point for this<br/>incredibly deep and profound style of music...within 2 songs, I had<br/>tears in my eyes because of the passion in his playing. There were times<br/>when his playing was more like Coltrane&apos;s &quot;sheets of sound&quot; concept than<br/>a &quot;blues&quot; guitarist...I&apos;ve been playing blues for 30 years, and I can&apos;t<br/>tell you what Buddy did in terms of scales, because he went totally<br/>outside of those concepts, into an area of pure sound and tone...it was<br/>a very humbling experience...he was &quot;on,&quot; as we say. It would be<br/>impossible to put what he did onto paper.<br/>    BB King was also on the bill, and was also masterful, but his<br/>playing was much easier to describe in terms of scales/pitches....yet,<br/>it was just as profound as Buddy&apos;s playing. In the final analysis, it&apos;s<br/>the level of expression that makes music happen, regardless of<br/>scales/tunings...that&apos;s why the playing of the masters will always be a<br/>source of discussion and wonder...they do whatever it takes to express<br/>what they need to express, regardless of theory...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=11625 href="#11625">ðŸ”—</a>jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com</h3><span>8/19/2000 11:10:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>Hello!</p><p>I completely agree with you. I think it&apos;s also why &quot;Meend&quot; makes East<br/>Indian classical music so beautiful. Because it&apos;s used to mimic the<br/>human singing voice. I&apos;m also a guitarist, and I recognize too that<br/>it&apos;s a huge part of good technique and one&apos;s own unique voice. And I<br/>think rarely is the guitar obeying the precise rules of any<br/>particular tuning - even though it may be kind of hovering around<br/>one. This is really evidenced by when you use a guitar as a midi<br/>controller in a sequencing situation. You can go in and take a look<br/>at the pitch controller information and it&apos;s plain to see that pitch<br/>bends are being generated almost constantly from the idoisyncratic<br/>pressures of the fingers on the strings (even the best players I&apos;ve<br/>seen do this). I believe it&apos;s really important to have some degree of<br/>this happening on the keyboard too (or midi wind instruments) - I<br/>actually like a combination of statically tuned timbres with ones<br/>that use a meend-like technique.</p><p>And Coltrane! He defines the word BEAUTIFUL to me! - his<br/>bending/multi-phonics is just such a &quot;body&quot; thing; I think is so<br/>obviously like a vocal technique. When I saw him playing on the<br/>documentary &quot;The World According to John Coltrane&quot;, it all came<br/>together for me. Just the incredible physicality of his playing in<br/>the last couple of years of his life was incredible.</p><p>Good Day!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:<br/>&gt;    I believe that the approach to notes in blues playing (some<br/>styles,<br/>&gt; anyway, where there&apos;s a lot of bent notes) is very similar to the<br/>&gt; approach taken in raga/maqam style...there are some fundamental<br/>&gt; guidlines, such as the blues scale, but the maestros are putting<br/>their<br/>&gt; notes in all sorts of places that may or may not involve a point on<br/>a<br/>&gt; scale continuum.

On the other hand, imagine setting up a theory and then<br/>testing it on masterpieces, to see what is in there.
