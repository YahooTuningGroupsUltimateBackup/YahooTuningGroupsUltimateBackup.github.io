What Monz meant was that the orbit<br/>&gt; is very elliptical, and so its speed varies quite a bit.</p><p>Yes, it is _very_ eccentric (0.248) compared with the others (except for Mercury<br/>which also has an eccentric orbit, eccentricity 0.206, Earth&apos;s is only<br/>0.07 by comparison).</p><p>Yes, I understand what Monz meant now.</p><p>Fact that it is mode locked with Neptune just means that if the orbital periods<br/>vary, the two planets have to vary their orbits in synchrony. It is perfectly<br/>possible that this happens. Indeed, I&apos;d have thought its likely there is such<br/>an effect, as all the orbital periods vary a bit under the influence of all the<br/>other planets, it&apos;s just a question of how large the variation is.</p><p>As with Jupiter&apos;s satellites, the (mean) 3/2 will be very slightly tempered,<br/>- the effect is that any well defined point in the orbits, such as Pluto&apos;s aphelion,<br/>say, will slowly drift round the sun.</p><p>There is some kind of theorem about this - maybe I can look it up<br/>when next in the maths / science library here.</p><p>All the eccentricities of the planets slowly vary with time too.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Also, that Pluto&apos;s orbit is also not so well known as the others<br/>&gt; &gt;as it hasn&apos;t completed a full cycle yet, and also, no spacecraft<br/>&gt; &gt;has visited it.</p><p>&gt; This is irrelevant because precise astronomical measurements allow us to<br/>&gt; very accurately forecast (and retrodict) Pluto&apos;s motion for thousands of<br/>&gt; years.</p><p>Can be very accurately forecast if you know the numbers. There are<br/>some clever computer programs that get astonishing accuracy that<br/>I remember about.</p><p>Though eventually, on large time scales, they are chaotic<br/>in the sense that it is impossible to predict Pluto&apos;s exact location in<br/>its orbit, even though the general position of the orbit can be<br/>predicted.</p><p>There is something about that, and more about resonances of orbits<br/>in the solar system here:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/Templarser/solarsys.html">http://members.nbci.com/Templarser/solarsys.html</a></p><p>However, astronomers get a much more accurate value for a planet&apos;s<br/>orbit once it completes a full cycle.</p><p>Also when a spacecraft visits a planet, you get much more accurate data<br/>about it&apos;s current position.</p><p>Sorry, don&apos;t know the details about that though.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Suggests the golden ratio doesn&apos;t it, as Mary<br/>&gt; &gt;mentioned in her post.</p><p>&gt; Yes, the golden ratio and other noble numbers are very important in orbital<br/>&gt; dynamics because they are the ratios that minimize the potentially<br/>&gt; destabilizing effects of resonances.</p><p>Interesting idea.</p><p>Would make sense for the asteroid belt, where asteroids are cleared out of<br/>(some) of the resonances - the Kirkwood gaps,</p><p>Now that&apos;s another set of ratios in astronomy, this time, an absence of<br/>orbits at various resonances:<br/><a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/a_histo.html">http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/a_histo.html</a></p><p>I wonder if that could be used for music too.</p><p>The gaps aren&apos;t completely empty, some asteroids actually orbit<br/>in a gap and stay in resonance with Jupiter for a substantial<br/>length of time - see<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/Templarser/solarsys.html">http://members.nbci.com/Templarser/solarsys.html</a><br/>again,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=17723 href="#17723">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
