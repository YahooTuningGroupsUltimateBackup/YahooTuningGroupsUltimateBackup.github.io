Here are a few responses to your thoughts:</p><p>&gt; Well, I don&apos;t have a good enough ear to know a high third when I hear it,<br/>&gt; and don&apos;t have experience of choral singing.  So there&apos;s not really much I<br/>&gt; can say, but it would be interesting if you could put numbers on this.</p><p>That was my original intention, but I&apos;m not sure it can be done. I&apos;m<br/>beginning to think there is another answer.</p><p>-----------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; As the human ear is more sensitive to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; flatness than sharpness,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Really? Tell me more. I don&apos;t know about this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t give a reference off hand, but physics of music books tend to<br/>&gt; cover this sort of thing.  It also agrees with anecdotal evidence: I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard more singers criticised for being flat than sharp.</p><p>Tuning is often more affected by poor singing technique than poor ears.<br/>Badly resonated or unsupported vocal tone tends to succumb to a kind of<br/>&quot;gravity&quot; that pulls is under pitch. The exuberant singer that pushes sharp<br/>is a rarer animal. So, you are correct.</p><p>-------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Consider that the &quot;demo&quot; I described has been tested many dozens of<br/>&gt;&gt; times<br/>&gt;&gt; with groups of singers who never met the others. Are you suggesting that<br/>&gt;&gt; _every group had an overexuberant singer? I doubt that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, but it&apos;s a possibility that the most confident singer will always be<br/>&gt; the one with the best memory of what the &quot;real&quot; chord should sound like.<br/>&gt; This could be tested: take randomly selected newbies, and get them to sing<br/>&gt; individually against a tape playing the root and fifth.</p><p>I&apos;ll add this good idea to my list and see if I can get to it.</p><p>-------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; If the chord &quot;locks&quot; it probably means an interval from this list is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; being<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; chosen.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That was my initial hope--to find such a simple explanation. However,<br/>&gt;&gt; look<br/>&gt;&gt; at the size of those numbers. I don&apos;t _think_ so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean the size of the cent-intervals or the size of the ratios?  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; open to the possibility that 24:19 could be perceived as such.  If you can<br/>&gt; show people consistently hitting this, it would be good proof.</p><p>The size of the ratios. That, I believe, is the basis for &quot;locking.&quot; My<br/>concern about 24:19 and the others is the question of why singers would give<br/>up the comfort of 4:5 for 24:19 or the like. It just doesn&apos;t make much<br/>sense.</p><p>----------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I saw a post on Usenet recently where somebody said that parallel major<br/>&gt; thirds increase the tension.  I presume he meant bare thirds (parallel<br/>&gt; fifths mean something else in voice leading, but again I&apos;m no expert).<br/>&gt; That went against my experience, so I tried it, and it is the case --<br/>&gt; provided they&apos;re tuned to 12-equal.  So it&apos;s the out-of-tuneness that<br/>&gt; gives the tension, not the third-ness.  However, the remark went by<br/>&gt; without comment, so I took it to be generally agreed that bare thirds<br/>&gt; (which most know only in their Equal Tempered form) are essentially<br/>&gt; dissonances.  Maybe he did mean voices moving in parallel thirds, I dunno.</p><p>I suspect that your source was referring to the fact that parallel major<br/>thirds creates a melodic cross relation of a tritone (C-e, d-F#). Most<br/>composers in the common practice period _love thirds, particularly Brahms.<br/>&gt;<br/>---------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, if I were singing a major third, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d get it<br/>&gt; accurately to say if it were a 5:4, 7:9 or even 9:11.  I should really try<br/>&gt; these things.</p><p>Sustain a low pitch on your synth and sing or hum (match timbre) a tenth<br/>above. Move it _very slowly upwards and downwards until it finds a position<br/>of optimum agreement. Now play the synth&apos;s tenth and note the difference.</p><p>(Commercial: get my &quot;Natural Ear Training&quot; for additional suggestions.)  :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>----------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, try for half an hour and see if it makes a difference.  Or even tune<br/>&gt; a keyboard to JI, hit a major chord and say &quot;sing this&quot;.  Or -- now here&apos;s<br/>&gt; an idea -- play a JI chord on a string patch, and get them to sing along.<br/>&gt; Then remove notes one by one, and see if the third changes as the keyboard<br/>&gt; loses it.  Try the same thing with the meantone fifth.</p><p>I really like this one.</p><p>&gt; One other thing I was thinking about.  You were saying<br/>&gt; before about how Sheila Chandra sang a high E with a low F.  It&apos;s also an<br/>&gt; article of faith (with some experimental backing) that minor seconds in<br/>&gt; melody tend to be narrowed, whereas larger intervals tend to be widened.<br/>&gt; The whole subject of melodic intonation tends to be ignored relative to<br/>&gt; vertical harmony.  I think the reason is that harmony can be easily<br/>&gt; explained with reference to the harmonic series, but nobody really<br/>&gt; understands pure melody in terms of anything more fundamental.  So, if you<br/>&gt; think you have something to say about melody, the field&apos;s wide open.</p><p>I plan to do so in my next book--if I ever get off this Tuning List<br/>addiction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But more specifically, the idea (which I agree with) that E# should be<br/>&gt; lower than F is entirely based on tuning to low-integer-ratio intervals.<br/>&gt; It has nothing to do with how scales will most likely be tuned<br/>&gt; melodically.  So you may find a melodic F appearing where a harmonic E#<br/>&gt; should be.  This is why I think it may be better to assume E# and F are<br/>&gt; the same pitch class, outside of an explicit meantone context.  If the<br/>&gt; harmonic and melodic rules lead to a different order of pitches, neither<br/>&gt; can be relied upon as a standard.</p><p>Yes. There is no doubt that any musician will notate Sheila&apos;s F as &quot;F,&quot; a<br/>diatonic member of the prevailing scale. Tuning it is a different matter.<br/>Calling it E# simply complicates understanding, in my opinion. (The key here<br/>is your phrase &quot;outside of meantone.&quot;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another thread: the measured values for C, E and G in &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love&quot;<br/>&gt; (see earlier in the month) are 262, 337 and 405 Hz.  That&apos;s consistent<br/>&gt; with the melodic intervals being stretched.  405/337, the measured minor<br/>&gt; third, is close to just, and so wider than ET.  A just major third would<br/>&gt; be narrower than ET, and so has to be stretched.  I wonder if the<br/>&gt; approximations to 9/7 and 6/5 are a coincidence.</p><p>I wonder. I haven&apos;t been able to find it (with small effort) to listen to.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks for your input, Graham. Every bit is important to me. Never can tell<br/>what thought will break it open.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
