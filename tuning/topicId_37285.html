For years, Steinway had prohibitions<br/>against retuning their pianos, though without explanation.  It seems that as<br/>one loosens the tension to a full quartertone--or greater--the tension<br/>disappears and there is only a flabby string.  Maybe it is less wound excess<br/>string in the design?  This slackening of tuning is not a problem on other<br/>piano makes.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
