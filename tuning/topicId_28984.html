May these words, however trivial they may seem, serve to<br/>encourage understanding among us as a musical community, possibly<br/>providing a model for a larger world community of peace with music as<br/>a force for communication and active reconciliation.</p><p>Mainly I would like to suggest that there are a range of &quot;middle<br/>paths&quot; between classic multiprime just intonation (JI) systems and<br/>equal temperaments or divisions of the octave (n-tET/n-EDO).</p><p>Further, tunings with octaves stretched or narrowed by a considerable<br/>amount from a pure 2:1, or where an &quot;octave&quot; may not be deemed a<br/>relevant concept (e.g. Bohlen-Pierce tuning in JI and tempered<br/>versions based on a pure 3:1 &quot;tritave&quot;), provide other musical paths,<br/>as do &quot;spectrum tunings&quot; based on the timbre of a specific type of<br/>sound generator (e.g. acoustical or electronic).</p><p>Here I would like to present three types of &quot;middle path&quot; tunings, a<br/>list possibly more suggestive than exhaustive.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>1. Pythagorean-based JI systems<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>Pythagorean tunings featuring a chain of pure 3:2 fifths or 4:3<br/>fourths have the property of being at once just and regular.</p><p>By combining two 12-note Pythagorean chains at some convenient<br/>distance, for example a septimal comma of 64:63 (~27.26 cents), we can<br/>achieve a JI system with the usual Pythagorean intervals within each<br/>chain, plus intervals mixing notes from the two chains at pure ratios<br/>of 2-3-7 prime (or 2-3-7-9 odd) such as 9:7, 7:6, 12:7, 7:4, and 8:7.</p><p>We thus get a 24-note system combining elements of regularity and<br/>purity with free transposibility: in effect, we have a regular chain<br/>of 23 fifths, with the one minor compromise that a single fifth is<br/>stretched by about 3.80 cents, the 3-7 schisma, to obtain pure ratios<br/>of 2-3-7-9.</p><p>Of course, like a regular 24-note Pythagorean tuning with 23 pure<br/>fifths, this is an open rather than circulating system; for<br/>circulation, we&apos;d need a cycle of 53 notes in pure fifths. However, a<br/>24-note chain provides lots of transpositions, much like an open<br/>meantone or other eventone tuning (see next section) of this size.</p><p>For the kind of neo-medieval European style that the arrangement of<br/>two 12-note Pythagorean keyboards a 64:63 apart might suggest, both<br/>the traditional Pythagorean intervals and the new 7-based ones are<br/>likely to be highly useful and largely interchangeable.</p><p>While other distances between the two Pythagorean chains can be very<br/>attractive also, free transposibility seems an element of &quot;middle<br/>path&quot; approaches, so it is the 64:63 system that I mention.</p><p>-------------------<br/>2. Eventone tunings<br/>-------------------</p><p>In addition to the meantone tunings discussed in this dialogue on<br/>&quot;middle&quot; paths, I would mention other &quot;eventone&quot; tunings with regular<br/>fifths all of the same size, and usual major thirds formed from four<br/>of these fifths up less two octaves.</p><p>Meantones are eventones where these regular thirds more specifically<br/>are at or near ratios of 5:4 and 6:5, with fifths narrower than the<br/>pure 3:2 of Pythagorean tuning. Other eventones may seek to realize or<br/>approximate ratios such as 9:7 and 7:6, or 14:11 and 13:11, with<br/>fifths tempered in the _wide_ direction.</p><p>Meantones and other eventones can sometimes very closely approach<br/>equal divisions of the octave, with the latter category possibly taken<br/>as a subset of the former. However, identical or near-identical tuning<br/>systems may be viewed from quite different musical perspectives.</p><p>For example, it is well-known that we can derive a circulating tuning<br/>of 31 notes per octave from either 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4<br/>thirds, or from 31-tET. These two tunings can both outstandingly serve<br/>Renaissance and related styles of music, as well as some later styles.</p><p>As it happens, similarly, an eventone tuning with just 14:11 major<br/>thirds is almost identical to 46-tET.</p><p>However, either of these mathematically synonymous tunings may be used<br/>for some quite different musical purposes.</p><p>Someone who speaks of a &quot;14:11 eventone&quot; is likely focusing on the<br/>regular and rather complex major third of this ratio (~417.51 cents)<br/>formed from four fifths up, analogous to the 5:4 major third of<br/>1/4-comma meantone, for example. Such a third nicely can serve a<br/>neo-medieval European kind of style.</p><p>Many advocates of 46-tET, however, regard the &quot;usual&quot; major third as<br/>the best approximation of 5:4, 15/46 octave or ~391.30 cents, an<br/>interval formed from 21 fifths up.</p><p>For a 14:11 eventone enthusiast, this interval in 46-tET or its close<br/>counterpart of ~391.92 cents in a just 14:11 tuning is a rather<br/>&quot;exotic&quot; one, occurring at three positions in a 24-note tuning --<br/>actually an augmented-second-plus-diesis.</p><p>As someone with a penchant for eventone tunings, I would say that the<br/>elements of regularity and transposibility within a given range of<br/>accidentals, and the diverse types of intervals generated as one<br/>carries the system to more notes, are strong attractions.</p><p>----------------------------<br/>3. Unequal well-temperaments<br/>----------------------------</p><p>Both traditional 12-note well-temperaments of the kind often favored<br/>in the era of European music around 1680-1850, and well-temperaments<br/>based on tuning circles of other sizes such as 17 or 19 notes, offer<br/>the advantages of a subtle shading of intervals within a system<br/>featuring transposibility and circulation.</p><p>George Secor has published a superb 17-note well-temperament[1], while<br/>Paul Erlich and others have devised new 12-note systems.</p><p>While eventone tunings may also have the property of circulation<br/>(e.g. 1/4-comma meantone in a 31-note cycle, or a 14:11 tuning in a<br/>46-note cycle), an unequal temperament often achieves such circulation<br/>in fewer notes by varying the size of fifths in the tuning chain.</p><p>This technique, at the same time, causes variation in the sizes of<br/>thirds and other intervals as one moves around the tuning circle. In<br/>either a conventional 12-note scheme of the 17th-19th century type, or<br/>a 17-note system such as Secor&apos;s, this gradation of intervals provides<br/>an impressive musical resource.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1.

You clarify some points, and also remind me of a very<br/>important omission which I may now correct before addressing some of<br/>your distinctions and questions, which maybe suggest a new category of<br/>tuning (or a subcategory of some approach you&apos;ve discussed?).</p><p>Of course I should have mentioned your 22-tone well-temperament for<br/>decatonic music, indeed combining this tonal system (your main theme<br/>in the article) with elements of the sruti system of India.</p><p>Why did I not recognize it as a &quot;well-temperament,&quot; as well as a<br/>&quot;cross-cultural&quot; kind of tuning system? What sticks with me especially<br/>is the use of some fifths tempered just slightly less than in 17-tET,<br/>a topic about which you ask and I&apos;ll reply a bit later in this<br/>article.</p><p>Anyway, from now on, I&apos;ll certainly mention your 22-tET<br/>well-temperament when I discuss this category, along with 17 and 19<br/>and so forth.</p><p>Moving to the MOS concept, I might propose a concept like &quot;dual-MOS<br/>tuning&quot; or maybe &quot;multiple-MOS tuning&quot; to include things like my<br/>24-note Pythagorean schemes where each 12-note keyboard indeed defines<br/>an MOS, but the overall tuning does not fit this category.</p><p>Your interestingly point to two attributes a &quot;microtempered 2-3-7-9<br/>JI&quot; tuning would need to quality as an MOS: first, all fifths of equal<br/>size (e.g. a temperament by 1/15 of a 3-7 schisma); and secondly, the<br/>right number of notes, such as 17 or 29.</p><p>I&apos;m noting that such a microtemperament -- or I&apos;m tempted to say<br/>nanotemperament, although that would be a different use of the term<br/>than the more specific concept of adjusting for synthesizer tuning<br/>units or the like -- in 24 notes would be strictly regular, but not an<br/>MOS.</p><p>What I&apos;m looking for is a term to communicate the idea of two MOS<br/>tunings, with identical 12-note keyboard arrangements, for example,<br/>which do not together form a larger MOS.</p><p>I&apos;m tempted to speak of a &quot;two-dimensional&quot; tuning system, whether<br/>based on Pythagorean (3-prime) JI or some temperament, since the<br/>&quot;rows&quot; are MOS systems of a certain size, and the &quot;columns&quot; are pairs<br/>of notes at a certain interval by which the rows are spaced.</p><p>Here maybe, as with consistency, we have the question: does an overall<br/>MOS organization maybe become less important as the number of steps<br/>and intervals increases?</p><p>In my view, a significant feature of a &quot;two-dimensional&quot; system with<br/>each row a 12-note MOS, for example, is that lots of melodies can be<br/>played and vertical progressions can take place within an MOS row.</p><p>For example, an 11-note Pythagorean tuning of the kind which may have<br/>been common on keyboards around 1300 (Eb-C#) seems to invite expansion<br/>to 12, especially once G# becomes a common accidental in progressions<br/>from E-G# to D-A (major third to fifth in its most decisive form with<br/>an ascending semitone).</p><p>However, does the distinction between 24 and 29, or between 36 and 41,<br/>have a comparable significance? At this point we have what might be<br/>described from a pragmatic viewpoint as &quot;multiple versions of the same<br/>note or interval category,&quot; whether the system is an MOS or otherwise.</p><p>The idea of a &quot;multi-MOS&quot; system may explain some of the appeal of<br/>24-note systems with two 12-note keyboards (Pythagorean, meantone, or<br/>neo-Gothic eventone, etc.)</p><p>Such system may represent a certain kind of compromise because it<br/>permits one either to pursue regularity and symmetry within one of the<br/>keyboards, or to seek new intervals, comma or diesis shifts, and so<br/>forth, by mixing notes from the two MOS &quot;rows.&quot; It is at once, one<br/>might say, both regular and irregular, maybe with some of the appeal<br/>of both alternatives.</p><p>You ask about my favorite equal temperament, and certainly I would say<br/>that 17 expresses a lot of what I&apos;m about for a very large portion of<br/>my musicmaking. It was the first non-12 equal temperament that I<br/>tuned, and I&apos;m very happy to be associated with it.</p><p>Curiously, nowadays, I find myself also a passionate advocate for<br/>13-tET as a neo-Gothic tuning: it seems very &quot;modernistic&quot; and<br/>21st-century, with the implied process of Chowningization or the like<br/>to obtain a 3:2-like effect for the 8/13-octave interval.</p><p>Here&apos;s a question: does being an &quot;advocate&quot; for an n-tET mean using<br/>and favoring it specifically as a complete system, or simply using<br/>some subset, and maybe being drawn to the division of the whole-tone<br/>into equal fractional parts or similar features?</p><p>For example, I&apos;m very enthusiastic about 29-tET, which I might guess<br/>that I&apos;ve used rather more than 17-tET -- but 12-out-of-29, or<br/>24-out-of-29, rather than the full set.</p><p>Am I advocating &quot;29-tET as a system,&quot; or simply &quot;a regular temperament<br/>around 703.45 cents&quot;?</p><p>With 13, 17, 20, 22, and 24, I often do tune the full set, and do<br/>encounter &quot;system properties&quot; such as the availability of any interval<br/>from any note.</p><p>However, with 29, it seems more to me like one pleasant point on the<br/>pleasant portion of the continuum roughly from 703.45 cents to<br/>something like the e-based temperament at 704.61.</p><p>One very humorous side of this question is the kind of system I would<br/>propose to carry 17 further, and get some new interval categories.<br/>Lots of people advocate 34-tET, an excellent solution if one wants a<br/>near-just 5-limit system, but own option is rather different.</p><p>Some months ago, it occurred to me that two 17-tET tunings at an<br/>arbitrary distance of around 55.106 cents would yield some pure and<br/>near-pure ratios of 2-3-7-9 (pure 7:6 and 12:7, with 9:7, 14:9, 7:4,<br/>and 8:7 impure by the same amount as the wide fifth, ~3.93 cents).</p><p>Also, we supplement the fine neutral intervals of 17 with some<br/>supraminor and submajor thirds and sixths, and add some interesting<br/>near-Pythagorean intervals, including a minor third close to 19:16<br/>(available for near-16:19:24 sonorities).</p><p>Maybe my problem is that it&apos;s hard to pick a single &quot;favorite&quot; n-tET<br/>because each has its own attractions -- and this includes 22-tET,<br/>where I find the 55-cent diatonic semitone quite satisfactory,<br/>although not everyone agrees.</p><p>A curious thing is that with 17-tET or 29-tET, I can easily articulate<br/>a defining quality of the &quot;equalness&quot; involved -- equal dieses or<br/>fifthtones fifthtones in 29, and equal thirdtones in 17.</p><p>With 46, I&apos;m more likely to say something like this: &quot;This tuning is<br/>almost identical to a 14:11 eventone, and has the same features:<br/>regular thirds near 14:11 and 13:11, very nice supraminor/submajor<br/>thirds, and some not-so-precise approximations of 2-3-7-9.&quot;</p><p>While I do clearly recognize 17 for its symmetry and &quot;17-ness,&quot; this<br/>might apply even more to 13, &quot;the division of the octave into 13 equal<br/>limmas,&quot; since 1/13 octave is very close to the Pythagorean limma at<br/>256:243 (~90.22 cents).</p><p>With 17, there is for me a kind of meeting of styles, with those<br/>beautiful 70.59-cent semitones and 423.53-cent major thirds for usual<br/>14th-century cadential progressions -- and in the right timbres, those<br/>thirds can be gentle and efficient at the same time -- and all those<br/>neutral intervals to lend a &quot;Romantic&quot; or &quot;Impressionist&quot; air.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like moving between a slightly alternative version of the<br/>Gothic Era itself, say around the time of Guillaume de Machaut<br/>(c. 1300-1377), and some curious conception of the &quot;Gothic&quot; in an<br/>alternative 19th-century Romanticism.</p><p>Also, I should mention something that maybe seems a bit more familiar,<br/>or at least a single keyboard within it -- 24-of-36, one of the best<br/>optimizations I&apos;ve seen for both 12:14:18:21 and 14:17:21.</p><p>Curiously, I haven&apos;t seen a lot of raving about 36-tET, or this<br/>subset; maybe it&apos;s mainly a question of what one seeks to optimize.</p><p>Of course, while we&apos;re at this, I should mention a &quot;near-ET&quot; that I<br/>use an immense amount: 1/4-comma meantone, which in 24 notes has many<br/>diesis steps and progressions available. Here, while I know that this<br/>isn&apos;t precisely 24-of-31-tET, I tend to count fifthtones as if it<br/>were; carrying to a full 31, one could also circulate around the<br/>system as if it were.</p><p>Anyway, for n-tET&apos;s which I tune as n-tET&apos;s (complete sets or<br/>subsets), I would say that 17-tET and 12-or-24-of-29-tET are my<br/>favorites, with 13-tET a favorite &quot;unconventional&quot; choice, and 20-tET<br/>also in this category as slightly less unconventional.</p><p>Thank you for the clarifications, questions, and ideas, as usual.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2001 11:43:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello, there, Paul and everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your explanation of the &quot;middle path&quot; as meaning an<br/>MOS<br/>&gt; system.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t necessarily, Margo.

For a neo-Gothic style<br/>alone, this might be described as a virtue, since these same intervals<br/>can serve as not too far from Pythagorean or 3-limit.</p><p>However, let&apos;s suppose we really want a Renaissance-style 5-limit. An<br/>excellent solution, it turns out, is a Renaissance-style meantone --<br/>in fact, the first regular meantone tuning known to us with a precise<br/>mathematical definition.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s Gioseffo Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone of 1558, carried to 24<br/>notes.</p><p>The regular major and minor thirds, of course, are only 1/7 syntonic<br/>comma from a pure 5:4 and 6:5 -- about 3.07 cents.</p><p>The diminished fourths are very close to 9:7 (~435.08 cents), at about<br/>433.52 cents, or ~1.57 cents narrow; and the augmented seconds quite<br/>close to 7:6 (~266.87 cents), at around 262.29 cents, or ~4.58 cents<br/>narrow.</p><p>Thus Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone yields a very nice approximation for<br/>6:7:9 or 7:9:12, although the near-7:4 is much less accurate than in<br/>1/4-comma meantone. Here 2/7-comma gives us an augmented sixth at<br/>around 958.10 cents, or ~10.72 cents narrow -- a variation on what<br/>might be the more curious side, possibly with a resemblance to the<br/>20-tET interval of 960 cents.</p><p>For a supraminor third at around 17:14 (~336.13 cents), we use an<br/>interval of a major third (~383.24 cents) less the enharmonic diesis<br/>of ~50.28 cents, at about 332.97 cents (~3.16 cents narrow),<br/>e.g. C*3-E3, with the ASCII * showing a note raised by a diesis. The<br/>submajor third near 21:17 (~365.83 cents) is equal to a minor third<br/>(~312.57 cents) plus a diesis, or ~362.84 cents (~2.98 cents narrow).</p><p>Maybe the most dramatic difference between 2/7-comma and 1/4-comma as<br/>24-note or larger tunings is that in 1/4-comma, the chromatic semitone<br/>of ~76.05 cents gets divided into two near-equal dieses of the kind<br/>called for in Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic styles -- a large fifthtone at<br/>around 41.06 cents, and a small fifthtone at around 34.99 cents.</p><p>In 2/7-comma, in contrast, we have a division of the chromatic<br/>semitone at precisely 25:24 (~70.67 cents) into a diesis at around<br/>50.28 cents, plus a kind of comma (the &quot;19-comma,&quot; the difference<br/>between 19 fifths up and 11 pure octaves) at around 20.40 cents.</p><p>Thus 1/4-comma, or 31-tET, is the appropriate choice for Vicentino&apos;s<br/>enharmonic progressions based on a conceptually equal division of the<br/>chromatic semitone into two diesis steps.</p><p>However, 2/7-comma is a fascinating system to carry to 24 notes for a<br/>mixed kind of &quot;neo-Gothic/Xeno-Renaissance&quot; style, and, of course,<br/>each 12-note manual provides a beautiful Renaissance meantone tuning.</p><p>Finally, Paul, you very correctly point out that my tuning with two<br/>17-tET chains (or 12-of-17-tET subsets thereof) at ~55.106 cents apart<br/>is equivalent to a distance of ~15.482 cents apart -- the sum of these<br/>intervals being the step of 1/17 octave, or ~70.588 cents.</p><p>My 55.11-cent arrangement is &quot;metachromatic,&quot; with 7:6 minor thirds<br/>played as major-second-plus-diesis, for example (C3-D*3), with lots of<br/>resolutions involving melodic motion from a key on one manual to the<br/>corresponding key on the other manual:</p><p>                     A*3  A3         F4   F*4<br/>                     G3   A3         D*4  C*4<br/>                     D*3  D3         C4   C*4<br/>                     C3   D3    or   G*3  F*3</p><p>In the first example, a near-12:14:18:21 (with the 7:6 pure and other<br/>intervals impure by ~3.93 cents) contracts to a stable fifth. In the<br/>second, a near-14:18:21:24 (with the 12:7 pure) expands to a<br/>near-2:3:4 trine</p><p>In this arrangement, the supraminor third has a &quot;conventional&quot;<br/>keyboard arrangement as minor-third-plus-diesis (e.g. E3-G*3), and the<br/>submajor third also as major-third-less-diesis (e.g. E*3-G#3).</p><p>In a version of this tuning with two 12-of-17-tET subsets, an<br/>advantage of the metachromatic arrangement is that we get the 2-3-7-9<br/>types of sonorities in more locations.</p><p>For example, we get a near-9:7 as fourth-less-diesis, in 11 locations;<br/>with a spacing of 15.48 cents, we&apos;d get it in 8 locations as a regular<br/>major third plus the &quot;comma&quot; between the keyboards.</p><p>With the 55.11-cent spacing, we get a pure 7:6 as tone-plus-diesis in<br/>10 locations; with the other spacing, we&apos;d get it in 9 locations as<br/>minor-third-less-comma.</p><p>However, the &quot;metachromatic&quot; diesis arrangement gives a near-7:4 as<br/>major-sixth-plus-diesis in 9 locations, while we get 10 with the<br/>15.48-cent spacing, where it is played as minor-seventh-less-comma.</p><p>With a full tuning of two complete 17-tET sets, the difference would<br/>seem purely one of taste, I guess.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2001 11:33:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello, there, Paul, and thank you for another very engaging response.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe we could distinguish between &quot;the middle path,&quot; meaning as you<br/>&gt; explain actually a number of approaches based on MOS or periodicity<br/>&gt; block structures (if I now follow correctly), and &quot;middle paths&quot; more<br/>&gt; generally based on some kind of eventone tuning, for example.</p><p>Hmm . . . the category of eventone tunings seems to be in some respects more restrictive,<br/>rather than more general . . . many linear temperaments are not eventone, and planar and other<br/>&quot;middle path&quot; tunings are generally not eventone either. &quot;Middle path&quot; is a term I introduced to<br/>simply suggest that there is much of interest to be explored in the conceptual area _between_<br/>ETs and JIs (not inclusive).</p><p>On a different issue:</p><p>&gt; With a full tuning of two complete 17-tET sets, the difference would<br/>&gt; seem purely one of taste, I guess.</p><p>And one would then have an MOS scale (of 34 notes), as well.</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2001 12:13:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Paul, and please let me clarify my intent possibly to<br/>expand the scope of &quot;middle paths&quot; a bit, but certainly not to<br/>restrict it or to exclude any of your suggested approaches.</p><p>In suggesting the inclusion of eventones as an overall category, I<br/>mean to suggest that the eventone nature of tuning might be taken as a<br/>sufficient condition, but by no means a necessary condition.</p><p>Specifically, I wish to include eventone tunings which may not,<br/>especially as overall systems, fit the MOS criterion.</p><p>Such systems might range from an &quot;array&quot; of two identical 12-note<br/>eventone tunings at any arbitrary distance apart, to a 15-note<br/>Pythagorean or meantone system with a &quot;split key&quot; arrangement or<br/>equivalent (e.g. Gb-G#).
