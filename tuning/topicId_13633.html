Dante&apos;s allusion to Dunstable is not far from<br/>the origins of the consistent following of this prohibition, maybe in the<br/>decade or two before the advent of meantone temperament (c. 1450?).</p><p>As I&apos;ve noted, one can find restrictions or prohibitions on parallel<br/>fifths, especially in simple two-voice writing, starting around the early<br/>14th century, and this development closely coincides with the use of the<br/>new term _contrapunctus_ or &quot;counterpoint.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, European medieval polyphony from the 9th through the 13th<br/>centuries features parallel fifths as a routine feature, and parallel<br/>fifths and fourths are very common in a wide range of world musics. Since<br/>I love these progressions, a survey of some recordings in the late 1960&apos;s<br/>and early 1970&apos;s underscord this point for me.</p><p>There is a bit of comedy in this, for in the 19th century, one German<br/>theorist argued that medieval sources should not be taken as actually<br/>describing polyphonic practice because &quot;parallel fifths are morally<br/>impossible.&quot;</p><p>Thus the question might be, &quot;Why are parallel fifths favored in many world<br/>musics, but somehow &apos;out of place&apos; in 15th-19th century Western European<br/>music based on a 5-limit concept?&quot;</p><p>With David Keenan, I agree that the common practice of singing in parallel<br/>twelfths, whether inadvertant or as a perfected art (described, for<br/>example, in medieval treatises), _may_ suggest a certain kind of<br/>&quot;affinity,&quot; although less pronounced than that of the octave.</p><p>By the way, I would prefer to speak of octave &quot;affinity&quot; also: the<br/>interval is often _like_ a replication, and yet can add something new,<br/>especially in a 3-limit setting where 2:3:4 has a saturated quality in<br/>comparison to 2:3 or 3:4 alone.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
