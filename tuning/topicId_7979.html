A historically<br/>&gt;&gt;unique form of &quot;dominant&quot;/tonic progression, to be sure.</p><p>And Paul Erlich responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo is talking about Gothic music, which predates &quot;dominant/tonic&quot;,<br/>&gt; &quot;major/minor&quot;, or many other concepts which seem to come from Mother Nature,<br/>&gt; but are in fact unique to our little (imperialistic) corner of space-time.</p><p>Of course. That&apos;s why my &quot;dominant&quot; is in quotes. I simply meant the the<br/>dissonace of the &quot;major third&quot; resolved to the consonant open fifth.</p><p>&gt; In Gothic times, the major third was an unstable sonority, and would<br/>&gt; typically resolve outward (i.e., in contrary motion) to a perfect fifth.<br/>&gt; Following the mathematically ambiguous suggestions of Marchetto and other<br/>&gt; authors, this third may have often been tuned even wider than its nominal<br/>&gt; Pythagorean value, 64:81 = 407.8&#xFFFD;. An _extremely_ wide value (even wider<br/>&gt; than the ones which evoked a perfect fourth in your ears when part of a<br/>&gt; triad) would be 7:9 = 435.4&#xFFFD;.</p><p>Possibly so.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
