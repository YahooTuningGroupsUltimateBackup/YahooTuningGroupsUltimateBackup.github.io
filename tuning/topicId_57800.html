It certainly wouldn&apos;t be easy to play, once<br/>you started using the remote keys in the circle of 19 fifths.</p><p>Perhaps it would be an easy route *into* meantone, but it would be a<br/>much more difficult route after about the first hour or so.  Much<br/>better to go generalized, which *gets easier* after the first hour or<br/>so.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=57802 href="#57802">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2005 1:56:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve gotten some people over at <a href="http://midi-contest.com">midi-contest.com</a> interested in<br/>meantone,<br/>&gt; and I was wondering if anyone sold something which could be used as an<br/>&gt; easy route into extended meantone, such as a 19-note Halberstat<br/>&gt; keyboard with seven splut black keys, etc.</p><p>Another question along the same lines is whether there is a plugin<br/>which will make Sibelius or Finale output pitch bends in some meantone<br/>system from a score in standard notation.</p></div><h3><a id=57803 href="#57803">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2005 4:40:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve gotten some people over at <a href="http://midi-contest.com">midi-contest.com</a> interested in meantone,<br/>&gt; and I was wondering if anyone sold something which could be used as an<br/>&gt; easy route into extended meantone, such as a 19-note Halberstat<br/>&gt; keyboard with seven splut black keys, etc.</p><p>I&apos;ve been privately corresponding with another list member about just that very topic. He sent me a link, and now I can&apos;t find it! It has to do with a 19-note-per-octave harpsichord (not Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo), with two adjacent black keys where one would normally be, and a single narrow black key between E-F and B-C.</p><p>I&apos;ve never played a split-black key keyboard, but I think I&apos;d have problems with one - namely the tendency to hit both black keys at once, since I have large fingers and hands. I&apos;d like to have one of the adjacent black keys shorter and raised higher than the other, like on Nahhas&apos;s 17-per-octave &quot;Oriental Piano&quot; that I posted about a couple weeks ago. There might be a problem with reaching those short black keys (or whatever color they may be), so I also suggested adding a lower and forward row of keys intended to be played with the thumb. I wish I had the means to cut some pieces of wood and build a non-playing test model to see how these two keyboard designs feel in the hand.</p><p>Whatever the case, I do not like Yamaha&apos;s patented 19-tone design. The extra seven keys are WAY too far forward, and square-shaped instead of long, which would cause serious problems for weighted-action keys. I&apos;d like to see that patent again, but the USPTO website isn&apos;t working right because they&apos;re doing a little reorganizing.</p></div><h3><a id=58032 href="#58032">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2005 4:09:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve gotten some people over at <a href="http://midi-contest.com">midi-contest.com</a> interested in<br/>&gt; meantone,<br/>&gt; &gt; and I was wondering if anyone sold something which could be used as<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; easy route into extended meantone, such as a 19-note Halberstat<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard with seven splut black keys, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another question along the same lines is whether there is a plugin<br/>&gt; which will make Sibelius or Finale output pitch bends in some meantone<br/>&gt; system from a score in standard notation.</p><p>***I&apos;ve certainly never seen anything like this for Sibelius, either on<br/>the Sibelius website or anyplace else...</p><p>J.
