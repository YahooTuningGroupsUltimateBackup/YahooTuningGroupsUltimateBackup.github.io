This yields a fifth<br/>of around 704.096 cents, or about 2.141 cents wide.</p><p>As I was soon noting, this temperament offers approximations of 14:11,<br/>13:11, 17:14, and 21:17 all within 1.5 cents of just.</p><p>During this excitement, Kraig Grady duly observed that the generator<br/>for this temperament also appears in Erv Wilson&apos;s Scale Tree, thus<br/>suggesting to me the name &quot;Wilson/Pepper Noble Fifth Tuning.&quot;</p><p>Early in October, I explored some of the possibilities of a 24-note<br/>regular version of this tuning, a process which, at the time, led me<br/>in some other directions.</p><p>A bit less than two weeks ago, however, an idea occurred to me: how<br/>about two 12-note chains of Wilson/Pepper fifths at a distance<br/>producing pure 7:6 thirds? For these fifths at about 704.096 cents,<br/>that distance is around 58.68 cents, the difference between the<br/>regular major second (~208.19 cents) and 7:6 (~266.87 cents).</p><p>To the excellent approximations of 14:11, 13:11, 17:14, and 21:17 in<br/>the original temperament, this 24-note system adds tempered versions<br/>of 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 in nine positions, with 7:6 or 12:7 pure<br/>and the other intervals impure by ~2.141 cents, the amount by which<br/>the fifth is tempered.</p><p>The main compromise is that the fifths are indeed tempered by a full<br/>2.14 cents, and thus 9:8 and 16:9 by twice this amount, 4.28 cents.</p><p>In contrast, a &quot;near-just&quot; system such as George Secor&apos;s original<br/>version of the Miracle tuning with a generator of (18/5)^(1/19) has<br/>approximations of these and all other ratios in the specified set<br/>within about 3.32 cents of pure.</p><p>However, &quot;Peppermint 24,&quot; as I have come to call it, has a special<br/>feature which I might term &quot;near-superparticular,&quot; with some emphasis<br/>on the engaging melodic as well as vertical possibilities. In the<br/>regular Wilson/Pepper temperament, 14:11 and 13:11 are quite close to<br/>pure, and 14:13 virtually just; in Peppermint 24, these ratios are<br/>supplemented by a pure 14:12 or 7:6.</p><p>As a result, all steps and ratios included in 11:12:13:14 are within<br/>1.5 cents of pure. A keyboard layout might make a discussion of<br/>scales easier to follow, with an asterisk (*) showing a note on the<br/>upper keyboard raised by an interval of about 58.68 cents:</p><p>    187.349  346.393              683.253    891.445 1050.488<br/>      C#*      Eb*                   F#*       G#*     Bb*<br/> C*        D*          E*      F*        G*        A*       B*     C*<br/>58.680   266.871    475.062 554.584   762.775   970.967 1179.158 1258.680<br/>           7/6<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    128.669  287.713              624.574    832.765 991.809<br/>       C#      Eb                    F#         G#     Bb<br/> C         D           E       F          G         A        B     C<br/> 0       208.191    416.382 495.904    704.096   912.287 1120.478 1200</p><p>Here the steps and intervals for a just realization of 11:12:13:14 are<br/>shown, along with note spellings and interval sizes for a tempered<br/>Peppermint 24 version:</p><p>   150.637      138.573    128.298<br/>    12:11        13:12      14:13<br/> 0        150.637     289.210   417.508<br/>1/1        12/11      13/11      14/11          Just<br/>............................................................<br/>C*4         D4        Eb*4        E*4       Peppermint 24<br/> 0        149.512    287.713    416.382<br/>          -1.126     -1.497     -1.126<br/>   149.512      138.202    128.669<br/>    -1.126       -0.371     +0.371</p><p>One source for the idea of 11:12:13:14 as a melodic or scale<br/>progression was a tetrachord mentioned in a book on medieval Near<br/>Eastern music, with a notable middle step of 7:6:</p><p>   1/1       12/11         14/11    4/3<br/>    0       150.637       417.508  498.045<br/>       12:11         7:6        22:21<br/>      150.637      266.871     80.537</p><p>This suggested to me a &quot;symmetrical pentachord scale&quot; in Peppermint 24<br/>with approximate ratios and tempered intervals in cents as follows:</p><p>   |------------------------------|       |--------------------------|<br/>  1/1    ~12/11  ~13:11  ~14:11 ~4:3    ~3:2  ~18/11 ~39/22 ~21/11  2/1<br/>   0     149.51  287.71  416.38 495.90 704.10 853.61 991.81 1120.48 1200<br/>  C*4      D4     Eb*4     E*4    F*4    G*4    A4    Bb*4    B*4    C*5<br/>     ~12:11  ~13:12  ~14:13 ~22:21  ~9:8  ~12:11 ~13:12 ~14:13  ~22:21<br/>      149.51 138.20  128.67  79.52 208.19 149.51 138.28 128.67   79.52</p><p>This &quot;nonatonic&quot; scale -- nine notes to the octave -- is very charming<br/>to my ears above a drone. Each &quot;pentachord&quot; divides a tempered fourth<br/>into approximate ratios of 33:36:39:42:44, with the two pentachords<br/>connected by a usual whole-tone near 9:8.</p><p>In conclusion, while Peppermint 24 is notably less accurate for some<br/>vertical ratios (especially 9:8 or 16:9) than a near-just temperament<br/>such as Secor&apos;s original Miracle tuning, its close approximation of<br/>the steps 11:12:13:14 might suggest a &quot;near-superparticular&quot;<br/>category.</p><p>Of course, a near-just temperament may also have near-superparticular<br/>melodic patterns, as with a 43-note version of Miracle with 42 secors<br/>of ~116.71559 cents, offering close approximations of 8:9:10:11:12 in<br/>21 positions. This is a division mentioned by Kraig Grady as advocated<br/>by Douglas Leedy, who finds 10:11:12 characteristic of unaccompanied<br/>music for fiddle or voice.</p><p>My special thanks to Erv Wilson and Keenan Pepper, of course, and also<br/>to such helpful people as George Secor, Alison Monteith, and Kraig<br/>Grady, among others, for enriching my view of vertical and melodic<br/>aspects of music and tunings.</p><p>Here&apos;s an unofficial Scala file for the curious, with the caution that<br/>I use the name &quot;Peppermint 24&quot; subject to correction of the premise<br/>that this name is not already in use for some other tuning:</p><p>! peprmint.scl<br/>!<br/>Peppermint 24: Wilson/Pepper apotome/limma=Phi, 2 chains spaced for pure 7:6<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 58.679693 cents<br/> 128.669246 cents<br/> 187.348938 cents<br/> 208.191213 cents<br/> 7/6<br/> 287.713180 cents<br/> 346.392873 cents<br/> 416.382426 cents<br/> 475.062119 cents<br/> 495.904393 cents<br/> 554.584086 cents<br/> 624.573639 cents<br/> 683.253332 cents<br/> 704.095607 cents<br/> 762.775299 cents<br/> 832.764852 cents<br/> 891.444545 cents<br/> 912.286820 cents<br/> 970.966512 cents<br/> 991.808787 cents<br/> 1050.488479 cents<br/> 1120.478033 cents<br/> 1179.157725 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38474 href="#38474">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2002 9:40:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo!<br/>    First let me congratulate you for having one of the few on this list to ever invoke the sense of smell.

Schlesinger gives ratios<br/>for a Hindustani _Rag Malkos_ reported by A. H. Fox Strangeways,<br/>which I offer with a query as to whether, if these ratios are<br/>accurate, they might reflect the influence of some Near Eastern<br/>tradition:</p><p>       1:1        14:12     14:11        14:9    14:8     14:7<br/>        0          267       418         765     969      1200<br/>            7:6        12:11       11:9      9:8      8:7<br/>            267         151        347       204      231</p><p>In Peppermint 24, using an asterisk (*) to show a note raised by a<br/>&quot;diesis&quot; defined by the distance between the two keyboards, ~58.68<br/>cents, this scale could be mapped (with a rounding discrepancy here<br/>and there):</p><p>       C4           D*4       E4          G*4    A*4       C5<br/>       0            267      416          763    971      1200<br/>             267         150        346      208      229</p><p>As Schlesinger observes, this fits the kind of arithmetic division by<br/>which she defines the _harmoniai_, here 14:12:11:9:8:7.</p><p>Some similar mixtures of intervals occur in a scale from the Scala<br/>archives with the name harmd-conmix.scl including some harmonic<br/>divisions (7:8:9, 11:12:13:14):</p><p>    1/1        8/7      9/7        3/2   11/7     12/7   13/7   2/1<br/>     0         231      435        702   782      933    1072   1200<br/>         8:7       9:8        7:6    22:21   12:11   13:12   14:13<br/>         231       204        267     81      151     139     128</p><p>Here&apos;s one mapping in Peppermint 24 of this 14:16:18:21:22:24:26:28<br/>pattern:</p><p>     F#*4       A4       B4        C#*5   D*5      E5      F5   F#*5<br/>      0         229      437       704    784      933    1071  1200<br/>          229       208       267      80      150     138    129</p><p>Needless to say, I&apos;d be curious about any responses you might have to<br/>these scales, or similar ones you may have sung or played in or<br/>otherwise encountered.</p><p>Thank you again for your encouraging post, and for the opportunity of<br/>sharing these scales (about which I learned in the process of<br/>replying) and celebrating the contributions of Erv Wilson and Keenan<br/>Pepper.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38506 href="#38506">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2002 11:44:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p>Hello Margo!<br/>    I don&apos;t know, but cannot remember if i pointed out the keyboard at</p><p> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/key.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/key.PDF</a><br/>top of Page 8</p><p>shows what i understand to be the two MOS 12 tone scales that involve Phi as a relation between sizes where the generator is a fourth.</p><p>BTW one could place your scale on the Bosanquet by taking this pattern and instead of it being placed on adjacent keys, it could be spaced (each 12 tone scale) on every other key with the other series being placed in between.
