I am appalled that Paul<br/>passed it on to you, even with my name removed. He has already apologised<br/>to me for this. I know he meant well. Nevertheless, I must accept the<br/>responsibility for having written it. I sure as hell don&apos;t want you blaming<br/>someone else.</p><p>To put it in context, it was written to Paul in a knee-jerk response to the<br/>&quot;49/32&quot; thread as it crescendoed in Digest 257 messages 2 (Erlich: &quot;So<br/>what?&quot;), 5 (Pagano: &quot;complete bullcrapo&quot;), and 6 (Beardsley: &quot;What&apos;s the<br/>problem...&quot;).</p><p>It seemed to me at the time that Paul was just making you guys angry or<br/>upset to no purpose. This was my way of encouraging him to either stop it<br/>or get clearer.</p><p>I hope my remark was at least partly responsible for helping Paul see where<br/>the communication failure was occuring, resulting in the later more<br/>satisfactory exchange in Digest 262 messages 5 (Erlich: &quot;_interval_&quot; vs.<br/>&quot;_pitch_&quot;) and 17 (Beardsley: &quot;Got it&quot;).</p><p>Again, my humble apologies. I think I&apos;ll just go crawl under a rock and die<br/>now, a serious lesson learnt. Feel free to have open slather at me. But<br/>after that, please ... put the gloves back on.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>patrick pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/1999 11:00:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David<br/>My main point with Paul was/is that all I was doing was making a comment on the<br/>49/32 (pitch, yes). I frankly don&apos;t mind nor care about peoples personal<br/>opinions<br/>of me but what i was trying to get at and still want to assert is that on an<br/>open forum<br/>list with folks who do TET music,JI etc... (and I think we have all learned a<br/>lesson or two about acceptance -at least i have-) You are going to get people<br/>who are interested in the theory portion of tuning and then of course the prax<br/>of it, so when someone makes an off thread comment chill out a bit and lighten<br/>and brighten instead of frownland. Lets please put this to bed, i am so tired<br/>of this i could begin weeping any moment.<br/>Cheers to all<br/>Resonate and extenuate<br/>Pat Pagano</p><p>&gt; . Feel free to have open slather at me. But<br/>&gt; after that, please ... put the gloves back on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan<br/>&gt; <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
