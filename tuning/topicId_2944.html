It may be portrayed as the simple rational<br/> tonal lattice:</p><p>                         .  9:8<br/>                   .  &apos;     /<br/>              15:8         /<br/>               /  &apos;-._    /<br/>              /       . 3:2<br/>             /  .  &apos;    /<br/>           5:4         /<br/>           /  &apos;-._    /<br/>          /       . 1:1<br/>         /  .  &apos;    /<br/>        5:3        /<br/>           &apos;-._   /<br/>                4:3</p><p> This description of the major scale is quite old, going back<br/> to approximately Rameau [*]</p><p> Webern says:</p><p> [Webern, _The Path to the New Music_, p 12-13]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... the fifth [degree of the scale = the 3rd partial] is the<br/>&gt; first obtrusive note, that is to say it has the strongest<br/>&gt; affinity with the tonic.  This implies that the latter note<br/>&gt; has the same relationship with the one a fifth lower.  So here<br/>&gt; we have a kind of parallelogram of forces, &quot;equilibrium&quot; is<br/>&gt; produced, there is a balance between the forces pulling upwards<br/>&gt; and downwards.</p><p> There is nothing especially new in this, either: it is a part<br/> of Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_ description too [p 23], and also<br/> has precedents, particularly in 19th-century German theory. [**]</p><p> But what struck me was the term Webern actually used to<br/> refer to this tonal structure: a parallelogram.  He&apos;s not<br/> using it in quite the same way Fokker did in describing his<br/> &apos;periodicity blocks&apos;, but it think it&apos;s an interesting<br/> premonitionary &apos;parallel&apos;.</p><p> A couple of pages later:</p><p> [Webern, p 15]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...notes are natural law as related to the sense of hearing.<br/>&gt; ... - So, a note is...complex - a complex of fundamental and<br/>&gt; overtones.  Now, there has been a gradual process in which music<br/>&gt; has gone on to exploit each successive stage of this complex<br/>&gt; material.  This is the one path: the way in which what lay to<br/>&gt; hand [i.e., the paradigm of the ratios of the lowest overtones]<br/>&gt; was first of all drawn upon, then what lay farther off....we<br/>&gt; find an ever growing appropriation of nature&apos;s gifts!  The<br/>&gt; overtone series must be regarded as, practically speaking,<br/>&gt; infinite.  Ever subtler differentiations can be imagined, and<br/>&gt; from this point of view there&apos;s nothing against attempts at<br/>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>&gt; quarter-tone music and the like; the only question is whether<br/>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>&gt; the present time [1933] is yet ripe for them. But the path is<br/>&gt; wholly valid, laid down by the nature of sound.  So we should<br/>&gt; be clear that what is attacked today is just as much a gift of<br/>&gt; nature as what was practised earlier.</p><p> [emphasis added by me]</p><p> So the composer who was held up by later advocates as the paradigm<br/> of 12-tone serialism liked the idea of &apos;quarter-tone&apos; [= 24-tone]<br/> music!</p><p> I&apos;m not very familiar with microtonality in Austria in the 1930s,<br/> but I would think that Webern is referring mainly to Haba and<br/> his followers.[***]</p><p> On the next few pages Webern discusses the quest for the discovery<br/> and expression of &apos;unity&apos; in the presentation of the musical idea,<br/> and I couldn&apos;t stop imagining Partch&apos;s Tonality Diamond in my mind<br/> as I read.</p><p> Upon re-reading this little book now, I see that there&apos;s material<br/> here that provides quite fertile ground for an imaginative<br/> &apos;marriage&apos; of serialism and JI microtonality.</p><p> -monz</p><p> [*]  More specific info would be appreciated, because I know<br/> that Rameau&apos;s major scale had 10:9 instead of 9:8, so this<br/> lattice is not accurate for his theories.</p><p> (see Rameau, 1722, _Traite de l&apos;Harmonie_, English trans. by<br/> Philip Gossett, 1971, _Treatise on Harmony_, Dover, p 28.)</p><p> [**]  Again, more specific info is requested.  (I believe<br/> Daniel Wolf knows more about this than anyone else posting<br/> to this List.) I&apos;m particularly interested in the history<br/> of this &apos;equilibrium of forces&apos; idea.</p><p> This was also an aspect of Rameau&apos;s theory, which I have<br/> seen referred to as the 1:3:9 polarity.  Rameau alludes to<br/> it in the 1722 _Traite_ as a 4:6:9 &apos;9th&apos; chord [p 38 in the<br/> English trans.], but does not seem to discuss it further in<br/> that early book.  Apparently it is explained in more detail<br/> in one of his later treatises.  (so Rameau experts are also<br/> sought).</p><p> I would express it as 3^-1 : 3^0 : 3^1 .</p><p> [***]  I&apos;d definitely appreciate knowing more about this!<br/> (... Daniel? Johnny Reinhard? Manuel?)  I&apos;d like to know just<br/> how familiar Webern was with these &apos;attempts&apos;, since he was<br/> congenial to them.  I have Moldenhaur&apos;s very detailed Webern<br/> biography, but not much about the microtonal goings-on of the<br/> period and place.</p><p> Joseph L.
