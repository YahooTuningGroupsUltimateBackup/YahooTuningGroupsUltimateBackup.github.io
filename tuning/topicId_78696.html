People have tried not tempering any intervals<br/>(just intonation), tempering such that two intervals remain just (e.g.<br/>quarter comma meantone), tempering such that only octaves are just (e.g.<br/>equal temperaments), tempering such that no intervals are just (e.g.<br/>TOP-RMS) and not trying to temper at all (e.g. equal divisions of phi).<br/>There isn&apos;t much room left for innovation at this level.</p><p>&gt; It seems the basic problem is that the ear defines sound by log and<br/>&gt; the harmonic series is linear and all the various scales are trying to<br/>&gt; fit one into the other.</p><p>Er, maybe.  The basic problem is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic:<br/>start with n primes and you need n distinct intervals.</p><p>&gt; I am curious as to what happens if you let the octaves not be exact -<br/>&gt; but let the other intervals be exact.</p><p>As in TOP-max?  It means the scale is slightly stretched or squashed<br/>relative to an equivalently optimal tuning with pure octaves.  It<br/>doesn&apos;t make much difference in practice.  Pianos are already tuned with<br/>stretched octaves.</p><p>&gt; It sounds like, on the surface, one gives up modulation - but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; think that has to be so.</p><p>You can have an equal temperament with some interval other than the<br/>octave just.  It has nothing to do with modulation.</p><p>You can have a lumpy, just intonation scale and still modulate.  All you<br/>give up is the mathematically exact repetition of intervals.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;d give up the circle of fifths returning to the same frequencies.</p><p>If you gave up on 12 note well temperaments, yes.

Fretting a guitar to a<br/>subharmonic series might make more sense because the frets would be<br/>equally spaced.  But if you want to fret to the harmonic series you can<br/>surely do it.
