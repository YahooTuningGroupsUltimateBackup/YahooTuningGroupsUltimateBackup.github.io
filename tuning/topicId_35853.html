Actually, it has<br/>nothing<br/>&gt; to do with the high third we&apos;re talking about here. Here&apos;s the set up:</p><p>&gt; Play a low C and ask the basses to match it. Then ask the women to tune<br/>&gt; a tenth above it. Once tuned, compare it to the piano&apos;s E and notice that<br/>it<br/>&gt; is as one would think--slightly below. No surprise.</p><p>&gt; Then play a low C and ask the basses to match it and ask the tenors to<br/>&gt; tune a perfect fifth above it. When the perfect fifth is in evidence,<br/>again<br/>&gt; ask the women to tune a tenth above the bass. Note that their &quot;third&quot; will<br/>&gt; be higher than the piano&apos;s third. *Big* surprise!</p><p>&gt; It works *every* time. I&apos;ve demonstrated it with my choirs, other people&apos;s<br/>&gt; choirs, and on the road with choral festival choirs I&apos;ve never met.</p><p>&gt; No 7ths, 9ths and 13ths. No 6-9 chords. Just a simple major triad. Just<br/>like<br/>&gt; in Renaissance endings.</p><p>That is extremely interesting and altogether disturbing!! I had not the<br/>chance to propose this experiment to our choir master yet but I can&apos;t wait<br/>to do so!</p><p>I have no explanation but only a few cues from my observation of a cappella<br/>ensemble sonogram. It seems that when a chord take place, the outer voices<br/>(i.e. soprano and bass) settle first while inner voices &quot;fiddle around&quot;<br/>their notes. Then after a very short while (order of tenths of second) inner<br/>voices find their place in the chord. I cannot claim to have a statistically<br/>representative sample but that seems to match subjective experience of<br/>chorus singing. Then intonation of various inversion of the same chord may<br/>be different, and furthermore, the order of entry of the voices may be quite<br/>significant as proved by Gerald experiment.</p><p>I have another remark, If we look at the placement of the partial in the<br/>chord, with emphasis on the common partial (assuming JI) for soprano-bass<br/>and soprano-tenor pair</p><p>soprano...........1..........2.........3.........4<br/>tenor..........1.....2.....3.....4.....5.....6....<br/>bass.........1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...0<br/>S/Bcommon....................X...................X<br/>S/Tcommon..............................X..........</p><p>In the first case (B,S then T entry ) sopranos can rely on the beat of their<br/>F2 with bass F5.<br/>In the second case (B,T, then S) depending of the physical disposal of the<br/>choir, the bass F5 may be more or less masked by tenor F3 which is normally<br/>much louder. Then instead of relying solely on bass F5, soprano may now rely<br/>also on the beat of their F3 with tenor&apos;s F5. Unfortunately, as I stated I a<br/>previous message, human voice is not produce by a string stretched on a<br/>wooden box and higher harmonics are not as sharp (in term of narrowness of<br/>spectral peak) as lowers ones, thus using soprano&apos;s F3 instead of F2 for<br/>beating cues for justness may be less reliable. If it is the case, sopranos<br/>may then rely on more subtle cues than beat adjustment (as well as on their<br/>musical subjective experience), subtle cues that may more subject to<br/>psychoacoustic affect such as octave stretching (but I do not know how).</p><p>Anybody has ideas on the subject?</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div>
