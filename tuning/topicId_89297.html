I tend to frown upon a tuning in which tempered<br/>&gt; fifths &quot;zig-zag&quot; in this manner.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The optimization here was to secure the A4=440 Hz international<br/>diapason (concert pitch) where the reference note A&apos;s relative<br/>frequency (in the Excel worksheet) would yield 220 when multiplied by<br/>either of 131, 131.25, 131.5 or 131 1/3, thus resulting in simple beat<br/>frequencies for fifths when working with a denominator based on them -<br/>which in turn would facilitate setting the temperament on an acoustic<br/>instrument by ear.</p><p>Andreas had chosen 131 as the denominator of his tunable-by-ear simple<br/>and proportional beating Well-Temperament ratios. I discovered a<br/>similar temperament based on the same denominator number by myself<br/>through another route. Then I tried 131.25, leading to UWT nr.2.<br/>Lastly I tried 131.3333, leading to UWT nr 3. This is my best try so<br/>far.</p><p>I also worked a bit on 131.5 as a multiple for reaching 220, but that<br/>yields a 891 cent A, which falls out of the scope of the Well-<br/>Temperament scheme to that of Modified Meantone. Though Temperament<br/>Ordinaires are a blessing and a breath of fresh air compared to 12-<br/>tone Equal Temperament, I wasn&apos;t successful in finding satisfactory<br/>beat ratios using 263 (or its multiples) as the denominator.</p><p>&gt; 2) The G-major brat is 2-4/7, which is not as simple as I would like<br/>&gt; to have for a triad this close in the circle of 5ths to C.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The chord G-B-D has the 5th/Mrd/mrd ratio as 3:7:18. That means the<br/>brat for M3rd/5th is 7:3, m3rd/5th is 18:3 and m3rd/M3rd is 18:7.</p><p>Not the greatest combination perhaps for so close a key as G Major,<br/>but still 7-limit.</p><p>I had to make a little sacrifice here to preserve the brat integrity<br/>of other tonalities. I could have chosen 589/394 as the fifth, but<br/>that would only serve to make things worse.</p><p>In comparison, your latest revision of 5/23 comma TX, whilst flaunting<br/>very good brats for the spectrum of Majors from Eb-G plus E and B -<br/>along with the Minors spectrum C-B (fabulously at that!), still has an<br/>issue with D Major in the 11-limit (8:22:11) and far-off keys going up<br/>as much as 53-limit!</p><p>My temperament&apos;s brats are all in the 13-limit range.</p><p>And let&apos;s do justice to the fact that you are working on a Modified<br/>Meantone, and I at a Well-Temperament scheme. One cannot have the same<br/>type of optimization strategy for both schemes.</p><p>&gt; 3) The 5.9-cent error in G-D is rather excessive for a low-contrast<br/>&gt; temperament.  I would expect all fifths to have &lt;5 cents error.  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; rather puzzled why this was done, considering that it didn&apos;t result<br/>&gt; in a simple brat for the G-major triad.<br/>&gt;</p><p>By having assigned 330/197 to A in order to acquire simple beat<br/>frequencies for fifths, I had to travel to that ratio thru a cycle-of-<br/>fifths using the same denominator or its multiples. Higher multiples<br/>often mean more complex beat rates.

As a practical temperament, ET probably never or rarely happened, due to the difficulty of tuning the successive fifths accurately. As others have no doubt found, ET is difficult to lay without a little machine (which the 18th century didn&apos;t have). I found that the temperament rarely turned out identical, and needed tweaking (these were the days when ET was all I knew about). The result generally slightly favoured one or another key, and not always the same one.  So a) it took much longer to tune and b)  the end-result was not consistent. I think nevertheless that the goal to tune ET was there in the 18th century, but it was considerably easier and quicker to tune an unequal temperament which came close to ET, and was consistent in its end result. I have to say that Kirnberger, in my experience, is the best solution.</p><p>&quot;...wonders whether it is possible to tune nine successive just fifths any more precisely (as in K&apos;s scheme).&quot;</p><p>I wonder which of Kirnberger&apos;s tunings he&apos;s talking about? I now use Kirnberger 2 (not 3) by default. This does not entail tuning 9 consecutive 5ths, where the posibilty for error is indeed quite high. One works from C, not A, and the three arms of the temperament all radiate from C; 1) a chain of fifths, almost pure, to F, Bb etc as far as Db (C#) (5 in all). 2) Returning to C the two fifths to D. 3) Again returning to C a pure major third to E, followed by two fifths to F#, and finally; 4) The placing of A exactly between D and E. If an error occurs during the processs, it is easy and quick to find out where. The fact that C/E is pure ensures that C major and surrounding keys still sound the best. The temperament is easy to tune, consistent, and pleasant in all keys. I can tune a five-octave clavichord or harpsichord in 20 minutes. Tantalising and logical though the theory was (is?), I think ET remained just that until the advent of exactly programmed<br/> electronic tuning machines. It is the only temperament, if it is insisted upon, for which I use my Korg.<br/>I have found that modern orchestras will accept Kirnberger 2 in place of ET - the only slight difficulty is getting the overall pitch right - as A is the last note to be tuned this can effect the overall pitch, but with modern electronics the C can be set to produce he required 440 (or 442) A.<br/>&quot;<br/>[So far about that statement of an highly esteemed expert-tuner.]</p><p>Just remember my own:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76326?var=0&l=1">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/76326?var=0&l=1</a><br/>&quot;<br/>as cycle of a dozen 5ths:</p><p>  110A_2  220A_3       440Hz=A_4<br/>                       329  =E_4      (&lt; 330 := 3*A_2)<br/>                       493.5=B_4      987B_5 := 3*E_4<br/>         185F#_3       370  =F#_4     740F#_5...2960F#_7(&lt;2961:=3*B_5)<br/>                       277.5=C#_4     555C#_5 = 3*F#_3<br/> 104G#_2 208G#_3       416  =G#_4     832G#_5 1664G#_6(&lt;1665:=3*C#_5)<br/>         156Eb_3       312  =Eb_4     := 3*G#_2<br/> 117Bb_2 234Bb_3       468  =Bb_4     := 3*Eb_3<br/>                       351  =F_4      := 3*Bb_2<br/>(65.7 131.4&lt;)131.5C_3  263middleC_4  526C_5 1052C_6 (&lt;1053 := 3*F_4)<br/>  65.7*3 = 197.1G_3    394.2 =G_4<br/>  (441/3=147 294 &lt;)    294.5 =D_4     589D_5 (&lt;591.3 := 3*G_3)<br/>                       440   =A_4     (&lt;441 := 3*147)</p><p>!wohltemperiert.scl<br/>!for J.S.Bach&apos;s WTC invented by Andreas Sparschuh in [2008]<br/>12<br/>!<br/>C-major beats C:E:G = 4: 5*(1316/1315): 6*(1314/1315) synchronously<br/>!<br/>555/526  !

So, in summary: this is a temperament that has four pure 5ths (A-E, and C#-G#-D#-A#), while all eight of the others are tempered differently from one another? And it works only at A=440Hz? And all the tempered 5ths (except maybe the leftover Bb-F) are supposed to beat at some simple multiple of 1 per second, each in some specific octave?</p><p>I&apos;ll try it out, but on paper I don&apos;t see how any of this synchronous-beating business is supposed to do anything perceptibly desirable (or undesirable) in the music. It just looks to me like a mathematical pursuit, for its own ends: to be able to say theoretically that some beats are lining up, and that this matters somehow if we&apos;d ever strike several notes exactly together -- and then hold them for several seconds while nothing else happens.</p><p>I know that when I play and listen to harpsichord music, I don&apos;t listen for beat speeds anywhere, or notice that any triads ever have anything synchronized (or unsynchronized) within them.  Except for final dyads or chords, there&apos;s never any time to perceive clearly what the beats are doing, or compare them with the beats in other dyads or chords. The music invariably has other interesting things happening, anyway, more noticeable than trying to count anything out of the sound during sustained notes.

My turn to be picky. Here are<br/>my reasons for not finding this GS-WT24d likable in terms of<br/>mathematical purity:</p><p>1. 7-limit brats for C Major, D minor, E minor and C minor! And a whopping 17-limit monstrosity right on G minor. You had critized me<br/>earlier for letting a complex brat as 3:7:18 take hold on G Major, and<br/>here you have similar or more complex brats for the starting tonality<br/>and four proximous minors to boot!</p><p>2. The triad error spread is not uniform in both directions from<br/>either the focality of C Major or A minor. UWT nr.3 spreads uniformly<br/>in fifths cycle in both the Major (&lt; F &gt;) and minor (&lt; A &gt;) keys.</p><p>3. Your focal points with least triad error are at G major and B<br/>minor! At least I did not skew the minor focality sharp-wise in my UWT<br/>nr.3.</p><p>4. All my brats are 13-limit, yours go up to 17-limit.</p><p>5. Surely, no one can tune this temperament by listening to as complex<br/>a beat frequency as 1.76 beats per sec, unless you want us to count 9<br/>beats every 5 seconds at 450 Hz for A!</p><p>6. As you mentioned, the zigzag there between C#-G# in the midst of F#-<br/>C# and G#-Eb. I don&apos;t know which one is worse?

Then you can set<br/>the temperament exactly using the same recipe at A=429 Hz. Modify your<br/>time increment to find the diapason you need.</p><p>If you have diapasons to suggest in order to historically realize a<br/>proportional beeating Well-Temperament all the while preserving the<br/>second as the unit of time, by all means, I shall labour to find ear-<br/>tunable UWTs based on them.</p><p>_________________</p><p>The beating frequencies will occur exactly as prescribed no matter<br/>when you strike the notes in a chord, and the brats will take hold<br/>instantly whether you strike them at the same time or arpeggiate. It&apos;s<br/>the same with 4:5:6. All the waves will phase-lock independent of<br/>their entry to the scene. This says something musical to us,especially since the relationships between the musical tones depend on<br/>the beating or the lack of beating of their partials!</p><p>True, one does not ordinarily or necessarily focus on the beats<br/>between frequencies, one is perhaps not even aware of their presence<br/>under regular circumstances. But they surely register in the brain,<br/>perhaps subconsciously, as we listen to and &quot;calculate&quot; intervals.<br/>What makes a fifth a wolf and what makes it pure is all dependent on<br/>the beating of its harmonics unless you are working with sine waves.</p><p>Frankly, I&apos;m surprised that you of all people disregard the role of<br/>beats in the tuning of musical intervals Brad! Especially since you<br/>have procured recipes to tune your Bach Temperament by ear based on<br/>them! Maybe an organ or harpsichord tuner is not searching for exact<br/>beat counts, but there are surely acceptable ranges for which beats<br/>are permissible, and key zones where they are more desirable than<br/>others. A 692 cent fifth would surely sound awful in Classical Western<br/>music simply because it would create awful beats that fall out of the<br/>range of permissability in the proper context. Ditto for the wolf<br/>fifth at G#-Eb for Meantone Temperaments, unless used for effect in<br/>the right setting. How about a 440 cent Major third? Or a 330 cent<br/>minor third? What do you presume is the reason they would resonate<br/>monstrously in a Bach Toccata or a Haydn Sonata? One need not listen<br/>to their beat speeds in order to deprecate them there. They register<br/>in the brain and signal a response. Please correct me if I<br/>misunderstood you here.</p><p>In sooth, having tried all the UWTs on my electronic piano using Logic<br/>Pro 8 sampled Steinway piano sounds, I definitely like the moments<br/>when I notice some regularity to the beat patterns in the flow of<br/>music. I appreciate it immensely when the air is filled with beat<br/>rates that resonate to the clock. I am cognizant of the beats more<br/>than the untrained layman here perhaps, but I have an inkling that<br/>commoners are more receptive to slight intervallic modifications than<br/>oft surmised. All mammalian brains will most likely be attuned to<br/>these special beat rates whether or not they are directly cognizant of<br/>them.</p><p>____________________</p><p>UWT nr.3 is the Layer I of my projected Yarman-36d, unless I discard<br/>the previous c, in which case the 36-tone tuning based on UWT nr.3<br/>will be Yarman-36c. I also want it to work as a replacement for 12-ET.<br/>The rationale is, of course, to faciliate access to beautiful music-<br/>making.

And it works only at A=440Hz?<br/>&gt; And all the tempered 5ths (except maybe the leftover Bb-F) are<br/>&gt; supposed to beat at some simple multiple of 1 per second, each in<br/>&gt; some specific octave?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll try it out, but on paper I don&apos;t see how any of this<br/>&gt; synchronous-beating business is supposed to do anything perceptibly<br/>&gt; desirable (or undesirable) in the music.

Except for<br/>&gt; final dyads or chords, there&apos;s never any time to perceive clearly<br/>&gt; what the beats are doing, or compare them with the beats in other<br/>&gt; dyads or chords. The music invariably has other interesting things<br/>&gt; happening, anyway, more noticeable than trying to count anything out<br/>&gt; of the sound during sustained notes. The beats are just too subtle<br/>&gt; to matter, IMO, next to the higher priorities of hearing harmonic<br/>&gt; quality of an interval, the tension/resolution, any melodic<br/>&gt; movement, and the broader Affekt of the music as it moves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Overall, please help me understand: is this some attempt to get<br/>&gt; keyboard instruments to project a consistent vibrato when playing at<br/>&gt; various places in the compass?

(And, all these &quot;procured&quot; recipes on my <a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a> site are *by* me, describing the way I set all those various temperaments by ear.)</p><p>The crucial thing here is: after setting one or two intervals at the beginning of a temperament bearing (such as the tenor F-A major 3rd of 3 beats/sec in 1/6 comma systems, from a diapason at or near A=440) -- all the other use of beats throughout the temperament *is not* by comparing them against any external standard: as &quot;per second&quot;, or in any other fixed tempo, where we know ahead of time what it ought to be.  It is all done by comparing the beats of intervals only with *one another*.</p><p>How do I know that a note such as G is similarly tempered from both the C and the D below it, in a temperament where both C-G and G-D are supposed to have the same fraction of some comma?  I move the G until I find the spot where the speed of the beat in the C-G 5th is 2/3 the speed of the beat in the D-G 4th: duplets against triplets (playing the two intervals separately, of course, not all three notes at once).  That is the only thing I need to know, in placing that note.  Numeric beat rates are irrelevant.</p><p>I have explained all of that here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tetrasect.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tetrasect.html</a></p><p>The quality of the interval (perceived directly) is of course defined by the presence or absence of beats in it -- the more beats, the more &quot;sour&quot; it is, along with the understanding that everything doubles at each octave -- , but again, I&apos;m *not* listening for beat-counting against any external standard of time or rate.  I compare the beat speeds of neighboring intervals: &quot;that one is twice as fast as this one&quot;, or &quot;that one makes triplets against this one&apos;s duplets&quot;, or &quot;that one is slightly faster than this&quot;, but only to evaluate and finely adjust the intervals that I have already set by perceived quality alone.  90% of the work is done without the beats; they are used only to confirm the results, or make tiny tweaks.</p><p>All of that stuff with numerically-measured speeds is *digital*.  I work in analog.  The harpsichord has to sound &quot;in tune&quot; to a brain that processes analog input (intervals sounding the same as or different from one another, by quality), not a digital brain that sits there counting everything that it encounters and assigning numbers to make value judgments.  I can get the quality of C-G and D-G to be the same, or very nearly so, without consciously listening for (or counting, or comparing) any beats.  If one of them is too good while the other is too sour, my wrist automatically moves in the right direction to rotate the pin and even these out.

Maybe an organ or<br/>&gt;&gt; harpsichord tuner is not searching for exact beat counts,<br/>&gt;&gt; but there are surely acceptable ranges for which beats<br/>&gt;&gt; are permissible, and key zones where they are more<br/>&gt;&gt; desirable than others. (...)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Disregard the role of beats&quot;?  Nay.  In tuning my harpsichords, and<br/>&gt; other people&apos;s harpsichords, I use the beats all the time.  (And,<br/>&gt; all these &quot;procured&quot; recipes on my <a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a> site are<br/>&gt; *by* me, describing the way I set all those various temperaments by<br/>&gt; ear.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>I know that the recipes there are formulated by you. Remember that<br/>English is my second tongue, so I may not always use the right word<br/>for the job. By &quot;procure&quot;, I meant in the figurative context: &quot;arrive<br/>at&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The crucial thing here is: after setting one or two intervals at the<br/>&gt; beginning of a temperament bearing (such as the tenor F-A major 3rd<br/>&gt; of 3 beats/sec in 1/6 comma systems, from a diapason at or near<br/>&gt; A=440) -- all the other use of beats throughout the temperament *is<br/>&gt; not* by comparing them against any external standard: as &quot;per<br/>&gt; second&quot;, or in any other fixed tempo, where we know ahead of time<br/>&gt; what it ought to be.  It is all done by comparing the beats of<br/>&gt; intervals only with *one another*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How do I know that a note such as G is similarly tempered from both<br/>&gt; the C and the D below it, in a temperament where both C-G and G-D<br/>&gt; are supposed to have the same fraction of some comma?  I move the G<br/>&gt; until I find the spot where the speed of the beat in the C-G 5th is<br/>&gt; 2/3 the speed of the beat in the D-G 4th: duplets against triplets<br/>&gt; (playing the two intervals separately, of course, not all three<br/>&gt; notes at once).  That is the only thing I need to know, in placing<br/>&gt; that note.  Numeric beat rates are irrelevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have explained all of that here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tetrasect.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tetrasect.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The quality of the interval (perceived directly) is of course<br/>&gt; defined by the presence or absence of beats in it -- the more beats,<br/>&gt; the more &quot;sour&quot; it is, along with the understanding that everything<br/>&gt; doubles at each octave -- , but again, I&apos;m *not* listening for beat-<br/>&gt; counting against any external standard of time or rate.  I compare<br/>&gt; the beat speeds of neighboring intervals: &quot;that one is twice as fast<br/>&gt; as this one&quot;, or &quot;that one makes triplets against this one&apos;s<br/>&gt; duplets&quot;, or &quot;that one is slightly faster than this&quot;, but only to<br/>&gt; evaluate and finely adjust the intervals that I have already set by<br/>&gt; perceived quality alone.  90% of the work is done without the beats;<br/>&gt; they are used only to confirm the results, or make tiny tweaks.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you conceive from &quot;counting the beats&quot;, but what you<br/>describe above is exactly &quot;counting the beats&quot;. You merely substitute<br/>the time increment. Above, you apparently use, instead of the second,<br/>the increment which is the least common multiple of the beat speed you<br/>take as reference. So, you count one fifth&apos;s beat as 1 unit per<br/>second, and calibrate the other so that it is 3/2 compared to the<br/>previous, etc...</p><p>Wallahi! Your recipe for the Bach Temperament depends 100 percent on<br/>listening to and counting the beats. How can you say you do 90 percent<br/>of the work without the beats? How do you tune the pure fifths if not<br/>by eliminating the beats? And how do you compare one fifth&apos;s beat to a<br/>third&apos;s if not by the beat count in the time increment you have chosen<br/>that yields simple beat frequency fractions for the whole operation?</p><p>I&apos;m amazed.</p><p>Moreover you have written:</p><p>Middle E from tenor A slightly flat, same quality as these other<br/>fifths. It should beat as a major third from middle C at 4.5 times per<br/>second. (4.2 if you started from an A=415.) Also check it as a 10th<br/>from tenor C, the same 4.5 times per second. An excellent test for<br/>this particular F-A and C-E is found at bar 21 of the WTC book 1 C<br/>major prelude. These two major thirds should have exactly the same<br/>character as one another, although the beat rate is different (since<br/>the pitch is different).Coincidentally (?) this is at the golden mean<br/>of this piece.... The A-E fifth should beat exactly half as fast as<br/>our original F-A major 3rd, sharing the same A.</p><p>Clearly, you have overlooked the fact that the tenor C cannot beat<br/>against the E an octave above 4.5 times per second while the middle C<br/>beats the same against it. Was this a typographical error? The beat<br/>frequencies are halved octaves down, and doubled octaves up. Moreover,<br/>the first approach yields a 694.5 cent fifth between A and E while<br/>your &quot;golden mean&quot; approach yields 698 cents. I presume the latter is<br/>correct.</p><p>There are even more wrongs here:</p><p>Copy middle E down to tenor E. For especially careful accuracy, fuss<br/>with both these E&apos;s until all four of the following points are true:<br/>(1) Whatever speed the tenor D-A 5th is, the fifth A-E across middle C<br/>should beat in 3/2 ratio from that speed (i.e. triplets vs duplets).</p><p>where the beat speed of D-A is clearly not 1.5 times the beat speed of<br/>A-E according to your recipe (1.694702091 Hz at 440 Hz diapason in the<br/>former versus 1.5 Hz in the latter). Forcing it reduces the A-E fifth<br/>size from 698 cents down to 693 cents.</p><p>And here:</p><p>(2) Likewise, whatever speed the tenor F-A major 3rd is, the middle C-<br/>E major 3rd is triplets against its duplets. [We are up a fifth on the<br/>keyboard, and all frequencies are 3/2 as much.]</p><p>Where the beat speed of F-A is clearly not 1.5 times the beat speed of<br/>C-E according to your recipe (6 Hz at 440 Hz diapason in the former<br/>versus 7.153846154 Hz in the latter). That would make the A-E fifth<br/>701 cents.</p><p>And here:</p><p>(3) Playing the tenor E as a 4th against tenor A, it should beat exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd. Likewise, the A-E<br/>5th we are testing across middle C should be exactly half as fast as<br/>our original F-A major 3rd.</p><p>Where the beat speed of E-A is clearly not 1/2 of the beat speed of F-<br/>A according to your recipe (1.5 Hz at 440 Hz diapason in the former<br/>versus 6 Hz in the latter). That would mean a 694 cent fifth across<br/>middle C.</p><p>Unless I have done any miscalculations or misunderstood you, it<br/>appears there is something horribly wrong with this recipe Brad.<br/>Please check your instructions above and consider the math.</p><p>&gt; All of that stuff with numerically-measured speeds is *digital*.  I<br/>&gt; work in analog.</p><p>Nothing is stopping you from working analog with UWT nr.3 if you set<br/>your metronome to 60 beats per minute. Or else, you can set the<br/>metronome to beat anywhere around 60 ticks per minute, take the new<br/>increments as the unit instead of the second, and still set the<br/>temperament by ear using exactly the same recipe I provided. The brats<br/>are always the same if you do it right no matter what the diapason<br/>(determined beforehand from the metronome ticks).</p><p>And there is nothing &quot;digital&quot; about the synchronous proportional beat-<br/>rates when you hear them filling the air around you.</p><p>&gt;  The harpsichord has to sound &quot;in tune&quot; to a brain that processes<br/>&gt; analog input (intervals sounding the same as or different from one<br/>&gt; another, by quality), not a digital brain that sits there counting<br/>&gt; everything that it encounters and assigning numbers to make value<br/>&gt; judgments.</p><p>Come on! I have demonstrated that you have made value judgments<br/>instructing the human ear and brain when you proportionalized the beat<br/>of one fifth to another. Howcome this approach is analog, and a<br/>similar approach involving the second (or some other unit) as the time<br/>increment &quot;digital&quot;? There is no conceptual or pragmatical difference<br/>in your approach versus mine, save that, my recipe is simpler and<br/>yields very well calculated beat rates that are in sync.</p><p>Not to mention... Having followed your recipe in an Excel worksheet to<br/>the letter, I have ascertained that, between the end result and the<br/>Scala file under your name, there are 3 to 3.6 cent errors on every<br/>tone except G and Bb, and a whopping 7 cents error on Bb! A gross<br/>694.5 cent fifth haunts F-C in the cycle also.</p><p>I can send you the Excel file I have worked with, so that you can<br/>cross check the results if you like.</p><p>Yet one thing is for sure, you can&apos;t go wrong with the recipe of UWT<br/>nr.3.</p><p>&gt; I can get the quality of C-G and D-G to be the same, or very nearly<br/>&gt; so, without consciously listening for (or counting, or comparing)<br/>&gt; any beats.  If one of them is too good while the other is too sour,<br/>&gt; my wrist automatically moves in the right direction to rotate the<br/>&gt; pin and even these out.  I can tune the harpsichord while thinking<br/>&gt; about other things!<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is a simple example of comparing the beat frequency of one<br/>interval with that of the other and equalizing them. Once again, it is<br/>a process that requires listening and judging the beat frequencies. In<br/>effect, you are making sure that the former interval&apos;s &quot;count&quot; is the<br/>same as the latter&apos;s.</p><p>The fact that you can do this while &quot;thinking other things&quot; shows<br/>somewhat that the process is geared in the subconscious in your case.</p><p>&gt; As a listener, I almost never listen for any beats.  Music is<br/>&gt; invariably doing other things more interesting than that.<br/>&gt;</p><p>As I had said, you don&apos;t need to &quot;concentrate&quot; on the beats during<br/>music. You don&apos;t even need to &quot;figure out&quot; the beat rates while<br/>playing or hearing. But if there is some sense to seconds as the unit<br/>time and some sense to obtaining a beautifully resonating temperament<br/>by ear using simple beats, then what argument can you have against it?<br/>Synchronous beat-rates are there not to be &quot;counted&quot;, but &quot;enjoyed&quot;.<br/>There are strong indications that there exists parallels between<br/>simple integer low-prime beat rates and nicely resonating chords or<br/>polyphonic passages.</p><p>&gt; This is why I don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; what people here write about, regarding<br/>&gt; brats and other synchronous stuff.  I fail to see or hear how it is<br/>&gt; musically important.</p><p>That&apos;s because you didn&apos;t try UWT nr. 3 on your harpsichord using the<br/>instructions you requested and which I provided. Try it first, and<br/>then let&apos;s hear your input.</p><p>&gt;  It looks to me like just a bunch of mathematical overkill, playing<br/>&gt; with numbers for the amusement of playing with numbers.</p><p>I already stated that I enjoyed the proportional-beating temperaments<br/>with my sampled piano sounds. The pursuit was not simply mathematical,<br/>but also musical.</p><p>So, instead of being so prejudiced and pessimistic about it, why not<br/>give it a try? Let&apos;s see how quickly you can set up UWT nr.3, and how<br/>it resonates with you.</p><p>&gt; The beats in intervals are useful to me only to get my tuning task<br/>&gt; (the physical process) done well and quickly, so I can get on to the<br/>&gt; more interesting task of practicing or performing the music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Unless you are doing your music in JI, beats will run the scene,<br/>whether you are cognizant of them or not. Still, it is evident that<br/>good music requires at least the subconsious to be satiated with<br/>reasonable beating in every interval under the proper historical-<br/>cultural-social context.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Brad Lehman<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Dr. Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=89422 href="#89422">ðŸ”—</a>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2010 1:13:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Wallahi!

I&apos;m an old-fashioned musician with a doctorate in harpsichord performance.  I do all my tuning from either a C or an A tuning fork, with no electronics.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet one thing is for sure, you can&apos;t go wrong with the recipe of UWT<br/>&gt; nr.3.</p><p>Not sure what you mean by &quot;can&apos;t go wrong&quot;, here.  I set it up here on my best harpsichord.  It took more than twice as long as tuning by more familiar methods that have consistent-sized 5ths; and I couldn&apos;t use my normal checks that go all the way up the treble, proving octaves by testing the intervening 4ths and 5ths for proper consistency (because you have half a dozen differently-sized 5ths....).  I gave it my best attempt, and it worked out reasonably well, going over everything twice to be sure it was accurate enough to your specs...which (frankly) seemed like an almost-futile pursuit, to me.  Harpsichords don&apos;t stay that tightly in tune for more than a couple of hours, even under best conditions, and some octaves and 5ths always have to be corrected every half day or so.  But, with it freshly tuned to your method, I tried it out in some of the WTC, especially in the B minor fugue.</p><p>My first impressions:</p><p>- The E-B and F-C 5ths above middle C are much rougher than I like them to be. 4 per second! Those scream at me, on harpsichord.</p><p>- The C#-E# and F#-A# major 3rds are spicier than I like them, but plausible, given some other temps where they are worse than that.</p><p>- F-A and C-E are both more active than I like them to be. If we&apos;re going to make these downtown major 3rds so unimpressive, why can&apos;t we at least pick up some more benefit in C#-E# and F#-A# while we&apos;re at it? All of this might be a non-problem on electronic pianos and such, but on a real harpsichord with steel strings, these jump out at me.</p><p>- Overall, the temperament sounds basically inoffensive, because it&apos;s close enough to 12-equal and doesn&apos;t have any glaringly bad spots, beyond the things I mentioned here.</p><p>- The putative synchronous beating does absolutely nothing for me as a player and listener. As I said yesterday, the music is always doing more interesting things on its own, without any of this allegedly synchronous beating to matter. Dyads and chords usually don&apos;t get held that long for it to be perceptible; and the music itself doesn&apos;t stick to simple major and minor triads very much!  Linear motion, suspensions, dissonances, modulations, etc are all much more important than sitting on elementary triads, trying to groove into any materially (or spiritually?) perceptible beating tricks. In other words, as I said yesterday, I Just Don&apos;t Get Why This Is Important.</p><p>(...)<br/>&gt; As I had said, you don&apos;t need to &quot;concentrate&quot; on the beats during<br/>&gt; music. You don&apos;t even need to &quot;figure out&quot; the beat rates while<br/>&gt; playing or hearing. But if there is some sense to seconds as the unit<br/>&gt; time and some sense to obtaining a beautifully resonating temperament<br/>&gt; by ear using simple beats, then what argument can you have against it?<br/>&gt; Synchronous beat-rates are there not to be &quot;counted&quot;, but &quot;enjoyed&quot;.<br/>&gt; There are strong indications that there exists parallels between<br/>&gt; simple integer low-prime beat rates and nicely resonating chords or<br/>&gt; polyphonic passages.</p><p>&quot;Nicely resonating chords&quot; come from having decently-clean 5ths, and from non-horrible major 3rds or minor 3rds where the note has the enharmonically correct spelling.  If we&apos;re trying to get some synchronized vibrato into things, like garnishing a sundae with whipped cream, that seems like a mildly interesting intellectual pursuit; but I don&apos;t get any of that from listening to ordinary music that I&apos;m playing.  I focus on the composition, not the consistency (or not) of any vibrato speeds anywhere.  If anything draws my attention to the temperament, it&apos;s 5ths, 4ths, and 3rds that suddenly sound rough or dissonant within their musical contexts, or it&apos;s any especially small or large semitones (which you don&apos;t have here).  Your Mileage May Vary.</p><p>If I want to play some music that sticks to the classic need for Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#, and no other notes, I pick whichever regular meantone system sounds most overall pleasing for the instrument I&apos;m on (it differs from harpsichord to harpsichord...), and I&apos;m done.  If some music requires alteration of a few notes at one end or the other, I retune them to the correct enharmonic spelling.  I only need circulating temperaments if I&apos;m going to play music that uses more than 12 notes at once.  Then, I know which compromises I&apos;ll have to live with, and my expectation of &quot;nicely resonating chords&quot; changes, accordingly.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a lot of interest in playing and holding elementary major or minor triads, for their own sake.  The music I care about has counterpoint, ornamentation, prepared dissonances, and more interesting chords that provide various tensions.</p><p>A &quot;beautifully resonating temperament&quot; to me is one that gives me all the enharmonic notes I need to play the given composition, and have all those notes sound reasonable within ALL the context where they appear.  Nothing startlingly far off the chromatic scale that is generated by some series of REGULARLY-sized 5ths.  Regular, geometrically.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is why I don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; what people here write about, regarding<br/>&gt; &gt; brats and other synchronous stuff.  I fail to see or hear how it is<br/>&gt; &gt; musically important.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s because you didn&apos;t try UWT nr. 3 on your harpsichord using the<br/>&gt; instructions you requested and which I provided. Try it first, and<br/>&gt; then let&apos;s hear your input.</p><p>I did.  See my input, above.</p><p>&gt; (...)<br/>&gt; Unless you are doing your music in JI, beats will run the scene,<br/>&gt; whether you are cognizant of them or not. Still, it is evident that<br/>&gt; good music requires at least the subconsious to be satiated with<br/>&gt; reasonable beating in every interval under the proper historical-<br/>&gt; cultural-social context.</p><p>I&apos;ll agree with that.  I&apos;d agree with it even more if it said &quot;satiated with reasonable intervallic quality&quot; rather than &quot;reasonable beating&quot;.  When the notes are too far out of tune vis-a-vis the way they&apos;re spelled, within scales and the harmonies derived from those scales, they stick out individually or collectively as sounding wrong.  The &quot;proper historical-cultural-social context&quot; is certainly key, in that regard.  If we&apos;re talking about the context of 17th and 18th century music, which I care about most, the notion of equal-beating temperaments is (I believe) moot and pointless.  If we&apos;re talking about the context of experimental or electronic music for 21st century listeners, grooving to synchronous beating that is supposedly important, that&apos;s an entirely different h-c-s context.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=89426 href="#89426">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2010 8:45:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Brad, in between the lines:</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On May 21, 2010, at 4:04 PM, bplehman27 wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dr Oz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have double-checked and triple-checked all the math.

It should beat as a major third from middle C at 4.5 times<br/>&gt;&gt; per<br/>&gt;&gt; second. (4.2 if you started from an A=415.) Also check it as a 10th<br/>&gt;&gt; from tenor C, the same 4.5 times per second. An excellent test for<br/>&gt;&gt; this particular F-A and C-E is found at bar 21 of the WTC book 1 C<br/>&gt;&gt; major prelude. These two major thirds should have exactly the same<br/>&gt;&gt; character as one another, although the beat rate is different (since<br/>&gt;&gt; the pitch is different).Coincidentally (?) this is at the golden mean<br/>&gt;&gt; of this piece.... The A-E fifth should beat exactly half as fast as<br/>&gt;&gt; our original F-A major 3rd, sharing the same A.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Clearly, you have overlooked the fact that the tenor C cannot beat<br/>&gt;&gt; against the E an octave above 4.5 times per second while the middle C<br/>&gt;&gt; beats the same against it.

For especially careful accuracy, fuss<br/>&gt;&gt; with both these E&apos;s until all four of the following points are true:<br/>&gt;&gt; (1) Whatever speed the tenor D-A 5th is, the fifth A-E across<br/>&gt;&gt; middle C<br/>&gt;&gt; should beat in 3/2 ratio from that speed (i.e. triplets vs duplets).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; where the beat speed of D-A is clearly not 1.5 times the beat speed<br/>&gt;&gt; of<br/>&gt;&gt; A-E according to your recipe (1.694702091 Hz at 440 Hz diapason in<br/>&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; former versus 1.5 Hz in the latter). Forcing it reduces the A-E fifth<br/>&gt;&gt; size from 698 cents down to 693 cents.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And here:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (2) Likewise, whatever speed the tenor F-A major 3rd is, the middle<br/>&gt;&gt; C-<br/>&gt;&gt; E major 3rd is triplets against its duplets. [We are up a fifth on<br/>&gt;&gt; the<br/>&gt;&gt; keyboard, and all frequencies are 3/2 as much.]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Where the beat speed of F-A is clearly not 1.5 times the beat speed<br/>&gt;&gt; of<br/>&gt;&gt; C-E according to your recipe (6 Hz at 440 Hz diapason in the former<br/>&gt;&gt; versus 7.153846154 Hz in the latter). That would make the A-E fifth<br/>&gt;&gt; 701 cents.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And here:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (3) Playing the tenor E as a 4th against tenor A, it should beat<br/>&gt;&gt; exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd. Likewise, the A-E<br/>&gt;&gt; 5th we are testing across middle C should be exactly half as fast as<br/>&gt;&gt; our original F-A major 3rd.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Where the beat speed of E-A is clearly not 1/2 of the beat speed of<br/>&gt;&gt; F-<br/>&gt;&gt; A according to your recipe (1.5 Hz at 440 Hz diapason in the former<br/>&gt;&gt; versus 6 Hz in the latter).

From middle C to the E above it, the beating is happening 2 octaves above the E.

In meantone and well-temperaments, this applies to seconds, minor thirds, major thirds, tritones, minor sixths and major sixths.<br/>In other terms, this (and other multiple approaches) is not only using beats because they&apos;re here or because they can help interval corrections or compromises, it is also harmonising the whole sound spectrum through open relations between tempo, beats, virtual fondamentals, difference tones, fondamentals, harmonics - and perhaps even colors, at least in the listener&apos;s poetical imagination !</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques Dudon</p><p>Brad Lehman wrote :</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; (...)<br/>&gt; Frankly, I&apos;m surprised that you of all people disregard<br/>&gt; the role of beats in the tuning of musical intervals Brad!<br/>&gt; Especially since you have procured recipes to tune your<br/>&gt; Bach Temperament by ear based on them! Maybe an organ or<br/>&gt; harpsichord tuner is not searching for exact beat counts,<br/>&gt; but there are surely acceptable ranges for which beats<br/>&gt; are permissible, and key zones where they are more<br/>&gt; desirable than others. (...)</p><p>&quot;Disregard the role of beats&quot;? Nay. In tuning my harpsichords, and other<br/>people&apos;s harpsichords, I use the beats all the time. (And, all these &quot;procured&quot;<br/>recipes on my <a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a> site are *by* me, describing the way I set<br/>all those various temperaments by ear.)</p><p>The crucial thing here is: after setting one or two intervals at the beginning<br/>of a temperament bearing (such as the tenor F-A major 3rd of 3 beats/sec in 1/6<br/>comma systems, from a diapason at or near A=440) -- all the other use of beats<br/>throughout the temperament *is not* by comparing them against any external<br/>standard: as &quot;per second&quot;, or in any other fixed tempo, where we know ahead of<br/>time what it ought to be. It is all done by comparing the beats of intervals<br/>only with *one another*.</p><p>How do I know that a note such as G is similarly tempered from both the C and<br/>the D below it, in a temperament where both C-G and G-D are supposed to have the<br/>same fraction of some comma? I move the G until I find the spot where the speed<br/>of the beat in the C-G 5th is 2/3 the speed of the beat in the D-G 4th: duplets<br/>against triplets (playing the two intervals separately, of course, not all three<br/>notes at once). That is the only thing I need to know, in placing that note.<br/>Numeric beat rates are irrelevant.</p><p>I have explained all of that here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tetrasect.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tetrasect.html</a></p><p>The quality of the interval (perceived directly) is of course defined by the<br/>presence or absence of beats in it -- the more beats, the more &quot;sour&quot; it is,<br/>along with the understanding that everything doubles at each octave -- , but<br/>again, I&apos;m *not* listening for beat-counting against any external standard of<br/>time or rate. I compare the beat speeds of neighboring intervals: &quot;that one is<br/>twice as fast as this one&quot;, or &quot;that one makes triplets against this one&apos;s<br/>duplets&quot;, or &quot;that one is slightly faster than this&quot;, but only to evaluate and<br/>finely adjust the intervals that I have already set by perceived quality alone.<br/>90% of the work is done without the beats; they are used only to confirm the<br/>results, or make tiny tweaks.</p><p>All of that stuff with numerically-measured speeds is *digital*. I work in<br/>analog. The harpsichord has to sound &quot;in tune&quot; to a brain that processes analog<br/>input (intervals sounding the same as or different from one another, by<br/>quality), not a digital brain that sits there counting everything that it<br/>encounters and assigning numbers to make value judgments. I can get the quality<br/>of C-G and D-G to be the same, or very nearly so, without consciously listening<br/>for (or counting, or comparing) any beats. If one of them is too good while the<br/>other is too sour, my wrist automatically moves in the right direction to rotate<br/>the pin and even these out. I can tune the harpsichord while thinking about<br/>other things!</p><p>As a listener, I almost never listen for any beats. Music is invariably doing<br/>other things more interesting than that.</p><p>This is why I don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; what people here write about, regarding brats and<br/>other synchronous stuff. I fail to see or hear how it is musically important.<br/>It looks to me like just a bunch of mathematical overkill, playing with numbers<br/>for the amusement of playing with numbers. The beats in intervals are useful to<br/>me only to get my tuning task (the physical process) done well and quickly, so I<br/>can get on to the more interesting task of practicing or performing the music.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=89432 href="#89432">ðŸ”—</a>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2010 10:31:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Re: 11/7,</p><p>my calculator gives 11/7 a value of 1.2044 (anything above zero should be good).

Are we to<br/>take them at face value?</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yet one thing is for sure, you can&apos;t go wrong with the recipe of UWT<br/>&gt;&gt; nr.3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not sure what you mean by &quot;can&apos;t go wrong&quot;, here.</p><p>I mean obviously: Although my tuning scheme was digitally calculated<br/>on paper, just as your 1/6 comma distributions on an Excel worksheet,<br/>my recipe provides exactly the tuning desired, unless, by some far-off<br/>chance, I made a mistake somewhere. I don&apos;t claim to be above<br/>mistakes... But really! I am not the one whose claims are hanging by<br/>the hook right now.</p><p>&gt; I set it up here on my best harpsichord.</p><p>I trust that you did it according to your perception and understanding<br/>of beats.</p><p>&gt;  It took more than twice as long as tuning by more familiar methods<br/>&gt; that have consistent-sized 5ths;</p><p>My dear colleague, by all that is good and holy, there is a glaring<br/>700.5 cent fifth right there between G-D among the more or less equal<br/>sized 1/6 comma tempered fifths (if you aren&apos;t picky about 0.6 cents<br/>deviations) when you set up your Bach tuning per your instructions.<br/>There is also a terrible 694.5 cent fifth between F-C. Please<br/>scrutinize the Excel worksheet to follow.</p><p>&gt; and I couldn&apos;t use my normal checks that go all the way up the<br/>&gt; treble, proving octaves by testing the intervening 4ths and 5ths for<br/>&gt; proper consistency (because you have half a dozen differently-sized<br/>&gt; 5ths....)</p><p>You need to test the purity of octaves via the addition of a fourth to<br/>a fifth or vice versa? Your complaint is strange, since the octaves<br/>are not to beat, but to be tuned purely. Why would there be a need to<br/>involve fifths and fourths when the octaves are not to be meddled with?</p><p>&gt; .  I gave it my best attempt, and it worked out reasonably well,<br/>&gt; going over everything twice to be sure it was accurate enough to<br/>&gt; your specs...which (frankly) seemed like an almost-futile pursuit,<br/>&gt; to me.</p><p>How unfortunate. Still, I thank you for finding the time to evaluate<br/>UWT nr.3.</p><p>&gt;  Harpsichords don&apos;t stay that tightly in tune for more than a couple<br/>&gt; of hours, even under best conditions, and some octaves and 5ths<br/>&gt; always have to be corrected every half day or so.</p><p>And you say this because it helps you promote the notion of equal<br/>sized fifths in a 1/6 comma Well-Temperament setting above other<br/>tunings?</p><p>Now I wonder, what is the margin of error for your Bach tuning? would<br/>you accept its validity even though it is distorted out of proportion<br/>to the berth of a Modified Meantone after a week of playing?</p><p>&gt;  But, with it freshly tuned to your method, I tried it out in some<br/>&gt; of the WTC, especially in the B minor fugue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My first impressions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - The E-B and F-C 5ths above middle C are much rougher than I like<br/>&gt; them to be. 4 per second! Those scream at me, on harpsichord.<br/>&gt;</p><p>My dear colleague, I&apos;m almost certain that you have set it up wrong.<br/>My E-B is 698.454 cents, my F-C is 699.759 cents. The former is<br/>supposed to beat 2 times per second, the latter (from tenor F), 3<br/>times every 2 seconds. Mayhap you are confused about the counts?</p><p>&gt; - The C#-E# and F#-A# major 3rds are spicier than I like them, but<br/>&gt; plausible, given some other temps where they are worse than that.<br/>&gt;</p><p>My C#-E# beat 16 times per second, and F#-A# 22 times per second. The<br/>former is 406 cents, the latter is 407 cents. Versus your 404 and 402.<br/>If you can differentiate 2-3 cents spiciness, then bravo!</p><p>&gt; - F-A and C-E are both more active than I like them to be. If we&apos;re<br/>&gt; going to make these downtown major 3rds so unimpressive, why can&apos;t<br/>&gt; we at least pick up some more benefit in C#-E# and F#-A# while we&apos;re<br/>&gt; at it? All of this might be a non-problem on electronic pianos and<br/>&gt; such, but on a real harpsichord with steel strings, these jump out<br/>&gt; at me.<br/>&gt;</p><p>My dear colleague, you must have really done something wrong, for see,<br/>my F-A is 393 cents, only 1 cent larger than yours, and C-E is 395<br/>cents versus your 392 cents. Are you certain that 1-3 cents difference<br/>&quot;jump out at you&quot;?</p><p>&gt; - Overall, the temperament sounds basically inoffensive, because<br/>&gt; it&apos;s close enough to 12-equal and doesn&apos;t have any glaringly bad<br/>&gt; spots, beyond the things I mentioned here.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you would humour me and labour the cross-check with a tuning device<br/>after you set it up one more time, and give a scholarly evaluation<br/>that corresponds to my tuning, and not some fancy set up, I would be<br/>glad.</p><p>&gt; - The putative synchronous beating does absolutely nothing for me as<br/>&gt; a player and listener.</p><p>Figures, since you must not have set it up right from the recipe I<br/>provided. Or else, there is the remote chance that I made an error<br/>somewhere, which I don&apos;t think I did!</p><p>&gt; As I said yesterday, the music is always doing more interesting<br/>&gt; things on its own, without any of this allegedly synchronous beating<br/>&gt; to matter. Dyads and chords usually don&apos;t get held that long for it&gt; to be perceptible; and the music itself doesn&apos;t stick to simple<br/>&gt; major and minor triads very much!  Linear motion, suspensions,<br/>&gt; dissonances, modulations, etc are all much more important than<br/>&gt; sitting on elementary triads, trying to groove into any materially<br/>&gt; (or spiritually?) perceptible beating tricks. In other words, as I<br/>&gt; said yesterday, I Just Don&apos;t Get Why This Is Important.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You just still might my dear fellow, if what you claim to do actually<br/>matches what the data is telling us.</p><p>&gt; (...)<br/>&gt;&gt; As I had said, you don&apos;t need to &quot;concentrate&quot; on the beats during<br/>&gt;&gt; music. You don&apos;t even need to &quot;figure out&quot; the beat rates while<br/>&gt;&gt; playing or hearing. But if there is some sense to seconds as the unit<br/>&gt;&gt; time and some sense to obtaining a beautifully resonating temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; by ear using simple beats, then what argument can you have against<br/>&gt;&gt; it?<br/>&gt;&gt; Synchronous beat-rates are there not to be &quot;counted&quot;, but &quot;enjoyed&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt; There are strong indications that there exists parallels between<br/>&gt;&gt; simple integer low-prime beat rates and nicely resonating chords or<br/>&gt;&gt; polyphonic passages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Nicely resonating chords&quot; come from having decently-clean 5ths, and<br/>&gt; from non-horrible major 3rds or minor 3rds where the note has the<br/>&gt; enharmonically correct spelling.</p><p>All of which have to do with beating.</p><p>&gt;  If we&apos;re trying to get some synchronized vibrato into things, like<br/>&gt; garnishing a sundae with whipped cream, that seems like a mildly<br/>&gt; interesting intellectual pursuit;</p><p>It&apos;s not just an intellectual pursuit as I told you before. It has<br/>musical significance, which awaits your evaluation once you set the<br/>tuning right.</p><p>&gt; but I don&apos;t get any of that from listening to ordinary music that<br/>&gt; I&apos;m playing.  I focus on the composition, not the consistency (or<br/>&gt; not) of any vibrato speeds anywhere.  If anything draws my attention<br/>&gt; to the temperament, it&apos;s 5ths, 4ths, and 3rds that suddenly sound<br/>&gt; rough or dissonant within their musical contexts, or it&apos;s any<br/>&gt; especially small or large semitones (which you don&apos;t have here).<br/>&gt; Your Mileage May Vary.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok. This point has been emphasized by me also, save the notion that<br/>beats are registered in the subconsious and constitute one pillar upon<br/>which harmonious music rests.</p><p>&gt; If I want to play some music that sticks to the classic need for Eb-<br/>&gt; Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#, and no other notes, I pick whichever<br/>&gt; regular meantone system sounds most overall pleasing for the<br/>&gt; instrument I&apos;m on (it differs from harpsichord to harpsichord...),<br/>&gt; and I&apos;m done.  If some music requires alteration of a few notes at<br/>&gt; one end or the other, I retune them to the correct enharmonic<br/>&gt; spelling.  I only need circulating temperaments if I&apos;m going to play<br/>&gt; music that uses more than 12 notes at once.  Then, I know which<br/>&gt; compromises I&apos;ll have to live with, and my expectation of &quot;nicely&gt; resonating chords&quot; changes, accordingly.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t have a lot of interest in playing and holding elementary<br/>&gt; major or minor triads, for their own sake.  The music I care about<br/>&gt; has counterpoint, ornamentation, prepared dissonances, and more<br/>&gt; interesting chords that provide various tensions.<br/>&gt;</p><p>All of which exhibit beats, or in my UWT case, proportional beat rates<br/>whether you hold any chords for a prolonged period or not.</p><p>&gt; A &quot;beautifully resonating temperament&quot; to me is one that gives me<br/>&gt; all the enharmonic notes I need to play the given composition, and<br/>&gt; have all those notes sound reasonable within ALL the context where<br/>&gt; they appear.</p><p>Agreed, if you do not underestimate the role of beats in the<br/>formulation of your &quot;reasonable sounding notes&quot;.</p><p>&gt;  Nothing startlingly far off the chromatic scale that is generated<br/>&gt; by some series of REGULARLY-sized 5ths.  Regular, geometrically.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So you claim on paper, so it remains to be seen in practice!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why I don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; what people here write about, regarding<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; brats and other synchronous stuff.  I fail to see or hear how it is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; musically important.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s because you didn&apos;t try UWT nr. 3 on your harpsichord using the<br/>&gt;&gt; instructions you requested and which I provided. Try it first, and<br/>&gt;&gt; then let&apos;s hear your input.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did.  See my input, above.<br/>&gt;</p><p>And I refuted that you apparently did some things wrong. See also above.</p><p>&gt;&gt; (...)<br/>&gt;&gt; Unless you are doing your music in JI, beats will run the scene,<br/>&gt;&gt; whether you are cognizant of them or not. Still, it is evident that<br/>&gt;&gt; good music requires at least the subconsious to be satiated with<br/>&gt;&gt; reasonable beating in every interval under the proper historical-<br/>&gt;&gt; cultural-social context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll agree with that.  I&apos;d agree with it even more if it said<br/>&gt; &quot;satiated with reasonable intervallic quality&quot; rather than<br/>&gt; &quot;reasonable beating&quot;.</p><p>But they surely are the same. You say it like a gem-stone dealer, I<br/>say it like a researcher.</p><p>&gt;  When the notes are too far out of tune vis-a-vis the way they&apos;re<br/>&gt; spelled, within scales and the harmonies derived from those scales,<br/>&gt; they stick out individually or collectively as sounding wrong.  The<br/>&gt; &quot;proper historical-cultural-social context&quot; is certainly key, in<br/>&gt; that regard.  If we&apos;re talking about the context of 17th and 18th<br/>&gt; century music, which I care about most, the notion of equal-beating<br/>&gt; temperaments is (I believe) moot and pointless.</p><p>Ok, I understand you think that way.</p><p>&gt;  If we&apos;re talking about the context of experimental or electronic<br/>&gt; music for 21st century listeners, grooving to synchronous beating<br/>&gt; that is supposedly important, that&apos;s an entirely different h-c-s<br/>&gt; context.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Brad Lehman<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=89434 href="#89434">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2010 1:16:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>O Bradley,</p><p>I sent you the Excel worksheet that involves the calculations I<br/>acquired from your recipe.
