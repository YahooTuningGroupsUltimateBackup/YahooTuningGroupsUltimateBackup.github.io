Do you mean language imposes constraints on<br/>&gt;perceptual cognition, or on other types of cognition?</p><p>Either way, sounds like Sapir-Whorf to me.  I just don&apos;t buy it.  I will<br/>allow that one language may excercise something more than another.  I&apos;ve<br/>heard that Arabic is supposed to be good for math.  I once met a guy<br/>claimed Russian was good for chess.  I disagreed, but he always beat me at<br/>chess.  I met another guy claimed English was the first of a new generation<br/>of languages that was &quot;competitive&quot; -- that would destroy or absorb other<br/>languages.  I disagreed, but only in English.</p><p>I agree with Daniel that the stuff of real interest happens inside a given<br/>language.  On the level of the individual user (as Daniel says), on the<br/>level of the dialect, and even with weird stuff like jive.  The kind of<br/>fine-tuning done by a good prose stylist (i.e. Bellow).  In the fall of<br/>1995, a group of friends and I managed to communicate almost entirely with<br/>a small set (less than 50) of phrases, most of them taken from the movie<br/>Braveheart.  Counting available nouns means nothing.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
