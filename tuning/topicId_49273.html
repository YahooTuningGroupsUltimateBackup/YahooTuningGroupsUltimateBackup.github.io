The<br/>professional Heckel, Puchner, or Fox is more stable than you have described.  Besides<br/>a professional AND tuned bassoon, the reed must match the instrument, and the<br/>player must match both.  My hunch is you are playing on student instruments<br/>that by their very nature are not very in tune.  If you don&apos;t have at least<br/>$5,000 to plunk down (and that&apos;s for the better, used instrument), you can&apos;t<br/>prognosticate about the weirdness of bassoons.</p><p>My microtonal fingerings hold up for all professional-level bassoons.  There<br/>are usually a couple of notes only that don&apos;t immediately comply.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; i.e., there might be six or seven different fingerings for<br/>&gt; the same high note, and on any given bassoon some will work<br/>&gt; better than others.</p><p>It is true that it will seem tougher to switch between bassoons than, say,<br/>saxophones or flutes.  Part of that is the difference in simplicity between the<br/>instruments.</p><p>&gt; i think a lot of it has to do with the narrow bore of the<br/>&gt; bassoon.  with the other wind instruments, which have a<br/>&gt; wider bore and larger tone-holes, the air pretty much escapes<br/>&gt; from the first open hole nearest the mouthpiece/reed.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t want to focus too much on the &quot;boring&quot; issues, but I do not<br/>think the bore has much to do with the pitch.  It is more pertinent to the<br/>volume, or lack there of.</p><p>&gt; but because the bassoon&apos;s bore is so narrow considering its<br/>&gt; length of ~7.5 feet,</p><p>8 feet, contras at 16 feet.</p><p>and also the small diameter of the &gt; tone-holes *and* the length of wood thru<br/>&gt; which they are drilled, much of the air on any given bassoon note continues<br/>&gt; to travel down the tube past the first open hole.  hence<br/>&gt; the need for all kinds of &quot;vent&quot; keys and all those weird<br/>&gt; fingerings.</p><p>The venting is the bassoon&apos;s way of substituting for an octave key.  Ventings<br/>are ways to ease large skips between notes.  But I&apos;m sure you mean we all<br/>vent, to let off some steam. :)</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=49435 href="#49435">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 1:45:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Peter Wakefield Sault&quot; &lt;sault@c...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It was Schumann who brought Chopin into public recognition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; really?  please, give more details.  i know that when<br/>&gt; Chopin moved to Paris in 1831 he befriended Liszt, Berlioz,<br/>&gt; and Mendelssohn.  how does Schumann fit in?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Let me quote from the &apos;Oxford Companion to Music&apos;, 10th Ed.</p><p>&quot;[Schumann] also engaged in journalism, founding and editing a<br/>musical paper which fought powerfully against the weaknesses and<br/>follies of the musical life of the day, and did enormous service by<br/>leading into the lighted circle of public recognition Chopin and some<br/>lesser yet worthy composers who might, without such help, have<br/>lingered much longer in outer darkness.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=49460 href="#49460">ðŸ”—</a>Maximiliano G.
