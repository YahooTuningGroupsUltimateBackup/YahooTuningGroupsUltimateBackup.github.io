Has anyone used these effects in recorder music, anyone know?</p><p>Also I wonder if you&apos;ve noticed the fingering for E in the third register<br/>(beyond the &quot;usual range&quot;) is always rather flat, and needs to be made<br/>sharper in the usual context in which it is played? A bit of a problem note<br/>in fact as it is very hard to bend its pitch by standard shading / leaking<br/>finger techniques.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; - 2</p><p>(a very useful note to have for trying out flute music just beyond the recorder<br/>era, and so it is awkward that it should be so flat).</p><p>I&apos;ve found out why - it is a perfect 5/2 above the 0 - 2! Blow a bit harder<br/>and you get the 3/1, again, perfectly in tune. Both notes are hard to<br/>bend the pitch of at all, so they give great reference points to hear<br/>what a perfect major third sounds like on the recorder.</p><p>I wonder if the changes in volume independent of pitch could be heard<br/>clearly on the recording? It has made such an amazing difference in the<br/>last week or so, hardly sounds like a recorder any more in some ways as<br/>one is so used to the recorder having a pretty uniform volume and only<br/>varying the attack and duration for the notes.</p><p>Imagine what a consort of recorders would sound like with all the parts<br/>varying in volume all the time - wouldn&apos;t sound the same at all would it!</p><p>However, I&apos;ve found out that this is a known thing but highly controversial<br/>as to whether it occurs at all, and not considered to be a siginficant effect.</p><p>But, I know it does from my own playing, and hearing it. No doubt whatsoever,<br/>not talking about a small barely hearable effect here, but a really big<br/>effect.</p><p>Can now bend the pitch of most of the notes (even recalcitrant<br/>ones like the &iuml;&iquest;&half; - 2) to pretty much wherever I want it in the general<br/>vicinity of the note, and play _really_ quiet or loud, or play a tune that<br/>gracefully trails away into quiet notes, and could never do that before.</p><p>Though, is easier if the fingering gives a note in the middle of the pitch area<br/>one wants as one has more flexibility to play about with</p><p>Here is an alternative fingering for the just major third E of the C major<br/>chord for the low and middle register on the recorder:<br/>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 - 7<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half; 1 2 3 4 5 6 - &iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>to match the beautifully in tune</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; - 2</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half; - 2 has a reasonably nice sustained tone for the high register, but is<br/>a little slow sounding for a fast tune. Then, &iuml;&iquest;&half; - 2  for the G in the third<br/>register is also slow sounding, but reasonably nice sounding too.</p><p>I&apos;ve devised a little exercise for learning to use turbulence to vary pitch and<br/>volume.</p><p>First, try blowing into the mouthpiece in a normal fashion with the breath very<br/>steady - gentle and steady - one wants a perfectly smooth airstream with<br/>no turbulence.</p><p>Now, blow ACROSS the mouthpiece with a very narrow airstream - will need<br/>to blow a little harder to get the same volume. Do it with extremely narrow<br/>airstream like whistling, and you will get a whuttering kind of sound<br/>like an owl hoot, so go to just short of that point.</p><p>You should notice the pitch of the note is a fair bit sharper.</p><p>Then having noticed the effect, one will eventually be able to make it<br/>also by just varying the way you breath into the recorder while playing<br/>normally, and without having to play across the top any more - I found<br/>it the other way round of course, by playing normally first, but this<br/>way is easier I expect.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>David J.
