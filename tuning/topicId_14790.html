So if I don&apos;t put _all_ the lines in, will it only look like the donut<br/>&gt;(10-star-in-10-gon) in one position, not 12?</p><p>I believe you&apos;re right, though it still might be more than 1 out of 12, I<br/>don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m on top of that. Notice how the hexany rotates about two axes at once.<br/>&gt;It rotates about the second one more slowly than the first. For each full<br/>&gt;circle about the first, it rotates about the second by the same amount that<br/>&gt;it turns about the first in one frame.</p><p>Oh -- I didn&apos;t notice that! If I made my hexany movie do that, it would be a<br/>very big .mpg file.</p><p>&gt;So what can you do with whatever tool you used to make that mpg. Can you do<br/>&gt;pseudo-3D projections of higher-D objects doing multiple rotations?</p><p>Obviously, if someone figures out the math to project it into 3-d, sure.</p><p>Oh, in trying to understand my own &quot;die&quot; program, I accidentally produced a<br/>version of my movie that reflects how I once proposed, on this list, that<br/>the 3-d triagular 7-limit lattice should look. In this version, the otonal<br/>triads are filled-in triangles, while the utonal triads are left open. This<br/>represents the idea that in the utonal triads, the consonance is due only to<br/>the consonance of the three intervals (represented by the three line<br/>segments surrounding the triangle), but the otonal triads, otonal &quot;synergy&quot;<br/>makes the triads extra consonant (thus the area of the triangle is<br/>filled-in): go to <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/</a> and download<br/>hexany.mpg.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
