It is simultaneously a<br/>schismatic system and a semisixths (78732/78125 comma) system.</p><p>87</p><p>Mentioned by Barbour as a 5-limit system; it supports kleismic tempering.</p><p>99</p><p>The first really important division left off the list, which I think<br/>should be on it. It is significant as a 7-limit system, having commas<br/>of 2401/2400, 3136/3125 and 4375/4374. Its errors, well under two<br/>cents, are by some people&apos;s ears just enough to be pleasing. If music<br/>needs to be written in something to make it worth talking about, I&apos;ve<br/>done that.</p><p>130</p><p>Twice 65, and important in the 7, 13 (and 15) limits in particular.</p><p>140</p><p>Mentioned in a manner of speaking by Edward Charles Titchmarsh in his<br/>book &quot;The Theory of the Riemann Zeta Function&quot;, where he discusses a<br/>high value of the Riemann zeta function which corresponds to the 140<br/>division. It is an important 7-limit division.</p><p>224</p><p>Important in the 13-limit in particular.</p><p>311</p><p>This remarkable division is important in the 13 through 41 limits, in<br/>every one of those odd limits. As a generic way of representing what<br/>some might maintain is anything anyone could reasonably want to<br/>represent it is of interest.</p><p>441</p><p>A very strong 5 or 7 limit system, along with 612 a good way to tune<br/>ennealimmal.</p><p>494</p><p>Strong 11-15 limit system, and still good as a 17-limit system.</p><p>559</p><p>A 5-limit system mentioned by Barbour.</p></div><h3><a id=57606 href="#57606">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2005 12:55:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>More possibilities:</p><p>80</p><p>A strong 19-limit system.

I was maintaining last year that 99, 130<br/>and 140 were in a good range so far as a balance between deviation<br/>from JI and usefulness of commas goes, which should count as advocacy,<br/>I suppose.
