This is true for scales such as the major scale 2 2 1<br/>2 2 2 1, but not for the type consisting of N large intervals and 1<br/>small. For example, the scale 9 9 9 1 is (strictly) proper even though<br/>the step interval size ratio is 9:1. Mea culpa. The inverse type such as<br/> 1 1 1 9  is improper, but 1 1 1 2 is proper, though very ambiguous.</p><p>--John</p></div>
