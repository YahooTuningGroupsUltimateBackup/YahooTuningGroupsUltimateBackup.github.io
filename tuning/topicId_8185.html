Most optimum fixed tunings are calculated. The main thing is that it is optimised for a particular piece. How about &quot;piece-optimised fixed tuning&quot; or something that means the same.</p><p>&gt;So I&apos;m sitting in the, uhhh, meditation room this morning, and suddenly<br/>&gt;think, &quot;Hey!  The calculated optimum fixed tuning values could be used<br/>&gt;as grounding points for adaptive tuning!&quot;  Then, about .1 second later,<br/>&gt;I thought, &quot;I&apos;ll bet Paul E has already posted that recommendation, and<br/>&gt;it&apos;s waiting in this morning&apos;s digest.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sure enough!</p><p>You&apos;re not the only two. I thought it was kind of obvious. ... And wrong!</p><p>The whole idea that there are only 12 notes is wrong (in general). So how could it make sense to spring them to _any_ fixed set of 12. JdL&apos;s algorithm is generally far superior to mine. But mine didn&apos;t have this failing. It was based on sliding the 12 available notes up and down an extended-meantone chain of fifths. It was real-time, not leisure. It would begin with a standard Eb to G# tuning of the available 12-notes and if certain things happened it would revise the G# to become an Ab, or the Eb to become a D# etc.</p><p>It would shift like crazy with diesis pumps, but at least it wouldn&apos;t make the mistake of trying to get D# and Eb to agree with each other when they didn&apos;t need to (because they were widely separated in time and modulation). A spring grounding them both to any single fixed pitch will also act as an unwanted spring between them.</p><p>John, you&apos;ve gotta figure out how to minimise the grounding.</p><p>What went wrong with the idea of grounding only one note (e.g. the tonic)? Or a few notes. Seemed very sensible to me. If a piece ends up having several unconnected (by springs) parts, surely you still only need one grounding spring per unconnected part. But I can&apos;t believe many pieces would be unconnected.</p><p>In fact, strictly speaking, all you need to fix is the pitch of one _occurrence_ of one note in each unconnected part (say the first note). Drift would be controlled only by the &quot;horizontal&quot; springs between occurrences of the same note (same MIDI note number modulo 12). The strength of these horizontal springs would be inversely proportional to the difference in time between the two notes.</p><p>Thus we would hope to control drift of the tonic but allow Eb to &quot;drift&quot; to become D#.</p><p>Incidentally is there some accepted shorter terminology to distinguish between a C (for example) in any octave at any time, a C in a particular octave at any time and a C in a particular octave at a particular time (in a piece).</p><p>I guess &quot;pitch class&quot; and &quot;pitch&quot; are precise for the first two. But &quot;note&quot; and &quot;tone&quot; seem to be used interchangeably and to be used for all three categories. Hence my use of &quot;note occurrence&quot; for the third category.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@io.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2000 9:38:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 03 Feb 2000 14:38:40 -0700, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Really nice sequences!!

You can hear me<br/>&gt;&gt;playing it (very badly) on the Tuning Punks site.</p><p>&gt;Oh, is that the piece?  It&apos;s kyool!  Not badly played, either, to my<br/>&gt;recollection.</p><p>Thanks. Hearing it now, I cringe. My sense of rhythm has improved greatly in<br/>the last 2+ years, and reaching those chords on the 22-tET-mapped keyboard<br/>was really tough. I even mapped some bass notes to the top of the keyboard,<br/>which results in an odd timbre since the keyboard&apos;s (Ensoniq VFX-SD)<br/>internal timbral parameters follow keyboard position, not actual pitch . . .<br/>Since then I&apos;ve gotten an 88-key control and figure out how to cut the<br/>timbre/keyboard sensitivity in half, yielding a much more realistic timbre .<br/>. .</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@io.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2000 8:09:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 04 Feb 2000 16:19:30 -0700, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Kyool!
