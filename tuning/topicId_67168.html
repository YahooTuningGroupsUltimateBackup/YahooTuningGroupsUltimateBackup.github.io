But I wanted to contribute a few words about the<br/>relation between my orbifolds and traditional tuning lattices.</p><p>1) Take a very simple log-frequency tuning lattice, with<br/>acoustically pure fifths on the X axis and octaves on the Y axis:<br/>moving one unit to the right raises the pitch by perfect fifth,<br/>while moving one unit upward raises the pitch by one octave.<br/>Now let&apos;s imagine that the axes are continuous -- if we move<br/>fractionally along the positive X axis, we glide slowly upward.  In<br/>this continuous version of our tuning lattice, every pitch will now<br/>represented by a line: for any distance that we move along the X<br/>axis, we can compensate with a move along the Y axis.  Thus points<br/>arbitrarily far away in the XY plane can represent the same pitch.<br/>Consequently, distance in this space isn&apos;t going to tell you about<br/>voice leading.<br/>This generalizes to higher dimensions.  It&apos;s typically impossible to<br/>embed familiar tuning lattices in continuous spaces where every<br/>point represents a *distinct* pitch.  Moreover, &quot;distance&quot; in the<br/>resulting spaces measures something other than the distance relevant<br/>for thinking about voice leading.<br/>(Note, by the way, that if you &quot;glue together&quot; all points<br/>representing the same pitch class, you end up with a log-frequency<br/>line corresponding to one of the axes.)</p><p>2) However, as someone on this list pointed out, it is possible to<br/>represent alternative tunings in my orbifolds.  Basically, any<br/>octave repeating scale (including an octave-repeating chromatic or<br/>diatonic scale representing a tuning system) gives you a way to<br/>measure distance in circular pitch class space.  Musicians typically<br/>refer to this unit of distance as a &quot;scale step.&quot;  Only in an equal<br/>temperament will all (chromatic) scale steps have the same log-<br/>frequency size.</p><p>As this happens, my &quot;ChordGeometries&quot; program depicts this nicely.<br/>Start the program, then do the following:<br/>a) Select &quot;Master Parameters&quot; from the &quot;Commands&quot; menu.<br/>b) Type in some (equal tempered) [sorry!] pitch classes into<br/>the &quot;Display These PCs&quot; menu.<br/>c) Press &quot;return&quot;<br/>d) Select &quot;Dyadic Space&quot; from the &quot;Geometries&quot; menu<br/>e) Select &quot;Parameters&quot; from the &quot;Commands&quot; menu<br/>f) Use the pop up menu that says &quot;No Lines&quot; to check &quot;Oblique<br/>Steps,&quot; &quot;Parallel Steps,&quot; and &quot;Contrary Steps&quot;<br/>g) Look at the resulting figure</p><p>What you see represents the metrical grid that a tuning system<br/>imposes on the continuous orbifolds.  It sort of looks like the<br/>terrain of a hilly city, viewed from above.  It&apos;s worth looking at a<br/>bunch of scales (using the &quot;Master Parameters&quot; window) to see how<br/>they generate different metrics.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br/>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.  If you need<br/>to reach me quickly, you should call me.</p><p>Dmitri Tymoczko<br/>Assistant Professor of Music, Princeton University<br/>Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study<br/>34 Concord Ave.<br/>Cambridge, MA 02138<br/>FAX: (617) 495 8136<br/><a href="http://music.princeton.edu/~dmitri">http://music.princeton.edu/~dmitri</a></p></div>
