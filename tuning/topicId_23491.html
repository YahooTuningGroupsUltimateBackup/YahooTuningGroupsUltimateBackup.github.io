Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; Really, I feel that all the &quot;splitting up&quot; that has been going on<br/>&gt; weakens all the lists.</p><p>Yeah, I have to agree.  I joined the &quot;practical&quot; list early, mainly<br/>because the long math stuff and lattice diagrams on this list just bore me<br/>stiff.  Fine, I can live with hitting delete until something interesting<br/>(to me) comes up.  What I can&apos;t abide is all the cat fights!!!  This list<br/>has recently experienced the stupidest bunch of long-running fights.<br/>Sheesh.  I guess it&apos;s because us microtonalists are so passionate that we<br/>get worked up into rabid frenzies and have to vent at each other!?<br/>Whatsamatter??  No wonder the world thinks we&apos;re a fanatic _cult_!</p><p>Anyway, I think the microtonal community is just too small to split off<br/>into little corners of 10 or 15, and I hope that people just get on with<br/>tuning and stick to this list.  Maybe people could learn to put hints in<br/>the subject line, like &quot;MATH&quot; or &quot;PERF&quot; (for performance) or something... I<br/>don&apos;t want to subscribe to 3 or 4 lists just to get a broad overview of<br/>what&apos;s current in the &quot;microtonal&quot; or &quot;tuning&quot; community.  And I don&apos;t want<br/>to subscribe to _one_ list that&apos;s all fighting and meta-posts.</p><p>Having said that... Here&apos;s my a &quot;practical&quot; tidbit of the day... The show<br/>I wrote some music for opened successfully here last Friday<br/>(<a href="http://www.cltc.org">http://www.cltc.org</a>, Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream).  I paced nervously for<br/>hours beforehand, but I don&apos;t think anyone noticed having all that<br/>12-out-of-17 tET poured into their ears.

I was especially<br/>disappointed to have to wade through unnecessary venom when I so love the<br/>sense of community that these lists have created. Therefore, I feel that,<br/>to get anything done here, I&apos;m going to have to switch my membership to<br/>&quot;no-email&quot; -- that is, I&apos;ll try to check in on the yahoo website from time<br/>to time, but in the unlikely event anyone wants a timely response from me<br/>personally, a direct email CC would probably be best. This switch is not<br/>out of protest but practicality.</p><p>Even so, I think that both the periodic complaints about &quot;too much math&quot; as<br/>well as the dismissive replies they sometimes get miss the point.<br/>Inasmuchas math is a method for manipulating symbols according to fixed<br/>rules and it is often useful to describe aspects of music symbolically,<br/>*all* music can be said to be &quot;mathematical,&quot; but that doesn&apos;t really say<br/>anything. What I see instead is a different model for making music.</p><p>A recent post in the &quot;miracle&quot; thread seemed to imply that the &quot;theorists&quot;<br/>on the list were a kind of research and development division that create<br/>constructs that composers can then put to creative use. Certainly that&apos;s<br/>one approach, one that has been used to great success by theorists and<br/>composers that I greatly admire, including Partch, Wilson, Schulter and<br/>many others. However, a great deal depends on the desiderata that these<br/>theorists are aiming for. Often their goals -- sometimes taken so<br/>frustratingly for granted as to be left unspoken -- don&apos;t really interest<br/>me at all.</p><p>But if it was just a difference of goals -- aiming for optimizing certain<br/>tetrads instead of smoothness or some such thing -- I would probably just<br/>be piping in with my own &quot;math.&quot; Instead, I think it&apos;s more of a difference<br/>of approach.</p><p>When I write a piece of music, it usually doesn&apos;t occur to me to first have<br/>a useful, overarching scale system and then see what can be done with it.<br/>Instead, I tend to try to create a scale (or series of scales or pitch sets<br/>or what have you) that fit the idea for the individual piece -- especially<br/>when I&apos;m working with computers. In the same way, I usually create the<br/>rhythmic patterns, the tonal structure, the timbres and so on at the same<br/>time. Proportionally, there seem to be few posts to consider the role of a<br/>tuning in the overall context of a particular piece -- how it best fits<br/>what the composer is trying to express.</p><p>I know there are other perspectives. Kraig Grady recently reminded us on<br/>the list that one can only really begin to know the potential of a tuning<br/>system after years of working with it, as he has with the eikosony. Though<br/>I respect that approach (and recently defended it in the face of Brian<br/>McLaren&apos;s snarling attacks), I guess I lack Kraig&apos;s perseverance.</p><p>This is not to say that I haven&apos;t gotten great ideas and deep insights from<br/>learning about things like CPSs, MOSs, lattices, and the like, but,<br/>frankly, reading much of the minutiae of scale construction on this list<br/>(and the metaposts like this it generates) leaves me feeling that I&apos;m<br/>wasting time that I should be spending composing (and the many other things<br/>that I should be doing). So for the time being, goodbye and happy tuning!</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

I also worry about how new<br/>comers may perceive this list if they come in during the in-fighting.  All<br/>of these new lists are confusing... especially since I do not see any reason<br/>for having a practical microtonal list.  Whatever is posted here ot there is<br/>microtonal oriented.  Why can&apos;t they coexist here.  If you don&apos;t want math,<br/>don&apos;t read it.  If you don&apos;t want &apos;practical&apos; tuning information don&apos;t read<br/>it.  I&apos;m on both lists currently and nothing astoundingly different has come<br/>out of the new list.  What is the difference?  What is the purpose?  Heck, I<br/>use the delete key for 50% of all listserv messages that I get, no offense<br/>to anybody, but I often have no understanding of what is being talked about.<br/>What is the point if many of us will subscribed to both lists.
