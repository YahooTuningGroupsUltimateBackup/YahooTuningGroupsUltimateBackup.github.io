Galliard studied composition under Farinelli, the director of<br/>music at the Court of Hanover, and Abbate Steffani. In addition to his<br/>composition ability, he was also a capable oboe and recorder player.<br/>Galliard made a step forward in his musical career when he performed<br/>one of his original compositions. This Sonata for oboe and two<br/>bassoons debuted at one Farinelli&apos;s concerts. Galliard earned an<br/>esteemed seat in the chamber music of George, Prince of Denmark.</p><p>&apos;Later, he moved to England where he would become the next<br/>chapel-master of the Somerset-House. Galliard became a familiar face<br/>in high society due to his proximity to and frequenting of the royal<br/>residence. In response to war victories, Galliard composed Te Deum,<br/>Jubilate, and three additional anthems.</p><p>&apos;Bigger and better things seemed promising following his participation<br/>in the founding of the Academy of Ancient Music. However, in the scrap<br/>for kingdom wide directorial status, Galliard fell short to greats<br/>such as Handel and Bononcini. He wrote the music to Calypso and<br/>Telemachus upon the request of a friend, the poet John Hughes. Despite<br/>approval from his peers, the show was a failure. As a result, he was<br/>refocused on his oboe performance.</p><p>&apos;He joined Handel&apos;s Italian Opera in 1713 as an oboe soloist. Galliard<br/>composed several more cantatas to texts by Hughes and Congreve. He<br/>published an opera, music to the Morning Hymn of Adam and Eve taken<br/>form Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost, and a large number of pantomimes (...)&apos;</p><p>He doesn&apos;t *sound* like a bumbling idiot who would write down a<br/>completely wrong theory of the diatonic scale. Good enough for Handel<br/>and the royal house of Hanover - but apparently not good enough for Brad.</p><p>Galliard is, actually, only one of many sources in the Baroque and<br/>Classical eras which describe the diatonic scale in terms of major and<br/>minor tones, which usually implies an untempered or Just form. See the<br/>Barbieri article in Early Music.</p><p> &apos;... Francesco Galeazzi 혰 who spent many<br/>years in Rome as a violinist at the Teatro Valle 혰 stated in<br/>1791 that the best performers changed the position of the<br/>major and minor tones according to the key of the composition.<br/>He included a fingering chart containing such<br/>alterations, by commas (illus.2). Furthermore, he suggests<br/>that his chart would make<br/>&quot;the less precise players laugh heartily, especially the ordinary<br/>ones who play merely for the practice&quot; ...&apos;</p><p> &apos;... Towards the end of the 18th century, the French experimental<br/>physicist Jacques-Alexandre Charles demonstrated 혰<br/>even at the Paris Conservatory of Music 혰 that<br/>Giambattista Viotti and Pierre Baillot employed a kind<br/>of just intonation in which G-A was made equal to a<br/>major tone (the narrowed 5th in the key of C major was<br/>thus A-E).&apos;</p><p>Strangely enough, such JI-based sources were ignored by Barbour and<br/>the stable of temperament fanatics, who followed him in seeing<br/>everything in terms of a set of 12 fixed pitches.</p><p>It is very easy to &apos;prove&apos; something if you focus on the sources that<br/>say what you want to hear and ignore the others, or label them as<br/>&apos;screw-ups&apos;.</p><p>By what standards should we consider Galliard a less trustworthy or<br/>significant source than Tosi? (Or Barbour? Or Haynes? Or Lehman?)</p><p>Isn&apos;t it conceivable or even quite likely that a large fraction of<br/>18th century musicians actually took a JI diatonic scale as their<br/>model, seeing the tempered intervals of the keyboard (if they thought<br/>about them at all) as a peculiar compromise only necessary for that<br/>type of instrument?<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div>
