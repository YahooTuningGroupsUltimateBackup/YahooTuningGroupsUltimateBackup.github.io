And his formula fails pretty badly for chords of<br/>three or more notes, where it fails to reproduce our observations<br/>that otonal chords are more consonant than utonal chords.</p><p>&gt; GB: I worked this stuff out a while back. I couldn&apos;t reproduce K&amp;K&apos;s<br/>&gt; quantitative results. I got good curves from Sethares&apos; formula,<br/>&gt; but this<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t with real-world timbres.</p><p>PE: The problem Sethares and I were finding was that, depending on the<br/>decibel level you assumed (yes, by &quot;amplitude&quot; Sethares really<br/>means &quot;decibel level&quot;), you can get a wildly different dissonance<br/>curve.</p><p>&gt; GB: All these measures will break down if you throw too many partials<br/>&gt; at them.<br/>&gt; One of the important parts of Sethares&apos; method is to simplify the<br/>&gt; spectrum to only the most important partials.</p><p>PE: Yes -- he justifies this in terms of masking.</p><p>&gt; GB: This is a subjective<br/>&gt; process, and so may be a problem with these automatic adaptive<br/>&gt; tuners<br/>&gt; people have in mind.</p><p>PE: Factors like vibrato, room acoustics, equipment fidelity, and of<br/>course volume will often be more important variables than timbre for<br/>the perception of consonance and dissonance.</p><p>&gt; GB: Partch didn&apos;t have a formula that I&apos;m aware of, other than the odd-<br/>&gt; limit.<br/>&gt; He drew what he thought made sense.

In this case, you pretty clearly want to<br/>use a harmonic spectrum, but you are left with a number of degrees<br/>of freedom as regards the amplitudes of the partials, and the<br/>pitch of the fundamental.&gt;&gt;</p><p>___________________________________________________</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26941">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26941</a><br/>[<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26941">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26941</a>]</p><p>Margot Schulter wrote:</p><p>&lt;Setharean tuning/timbre systems alike leads me to favor a subtle and<br/>complex approach to questions of consonance/dissonance.

That is - the (steady<br/>&gt; state, as well as the transient) frequency spectrums of the (complex)<br/>&gt; tones number 1 and number 2 from which the dyad is constructed must<br/>&gt; be identical (or nearly identical) in order for your assumption (b)<br/>&gt; directly above to be valid?</p><p>JG: Additionally, due to the nonlinear amplitude transfer function of<br/>perceived loudness levels [shown as approximately equal to a value of<br/>( (SPL)b/(SPL)a )^(2/3) at SPL levels greater than 20 PHONS (in SPL),<br/>which is equal to 0.1 SONE (in LOUDNESS UNITS, being 20 dB above the<br/>threshold of human hearing)] [from &quot;Music, Physics, and Engineering&quot;,<br/>Olson, 1967, page 252], is it not also true that, in order that &quot;the<br/>spectral amplitudes of each of the overtones of the individual<br/>fundamental frequencies of such individual complex tones&quot; remain<br/>identical (or nearly identical) relative to the amplitudes of those<br/>fundamental frequencies - that the two identical (steady-state as<br/>well as transient) frequency spectrums of the (complex) tones number<br/>1 and number 2 from which the dyad is constructed ALSO be of equal<br/>(or near equal) scalar amplitude throughout the time period during<br/>which each of the individual complex tones are sounded (steady-state<br/>as well as transient)?<br/>NOTE: The phrases &quot;steady-state&quot; as well as &quot;transient&quot; are utilized<br/>above in an inclusive manner to describe all phases of the process of<br/>time-varying amplitude envelopes multiplying each of the values of<br/>the individual complex tones (existing for some given time duration)<br/>from which the dyad is constructed.</p><p>In harmonic_entropy mesage 531, Paul Erlich (responding to J Gill&apos;s questions<br/>regarding the conditions under which the &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; model is applicable<br/>for &quot;harmonic dyads&quot;) wrote:</p><p>&gt;JG: That is - the (steady<br/>&gt; state, as well as the transient) frequency spectrums of the (complex)<br/>&gt; tones number 1 and number 2 from which the dyad is constructed must<br/>&gt;

*as<br/>perceptually experienced*.</p><p>Returning again to Paul Erlich&apos;s comments (excerpted from quoted statements<br/>above):</p><p>PE: The problem Sethares and I were finding was that, depending on the<br/>decibel level you assumed (yes, by &quot;amplitude&quot; Sethares really<br/>means &quot;decibel level&quot;), you can get a wildly different dissonance<br/>curve.</p><p>Returning again to Paul Erlich&apos;s statements regarding the &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot;<br/>concept:</p><p>PE: For the assumption to be valid, both tones would have to have a fairly<br/>complete complement of overtones, present with decent amplitude, in the<br/>frequency range in question.</p><p>J Gill: For reasons other than amplitude nonlinearities, as well as for reason<br/>of amplitude nonlinearities, it appears (to me) that the application of<br/>&quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; to a (&quot;complex&quot; or &quot;harmonic&quot;) dyad (where both tones of the<br/>dyad contain harmonics of the individual fundamental frequencies of the<br/>individual notes&apos; pitch) is premised (in the ideal sense of the model) upon the<br/>two &quot;complex&quot; notes to be considered having:</p><p>(1) Identical measured *loudness* levels for each of the fundamental frequency<br/>components; and</p><p>(2) Identical relative amplitudes for each member of the set of the &quot;harmonics&quot;<br/>existing at integer multiples of the individual fundamental frequency<br/>components.</p><p>The sinusoidal case of applying the &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; concept removes<br/>consideration &apos;(2)&apos; directly above, but appears to, as well, be subject to<br/>consideration &apos;(1)&apos; directly above.</p><p>It appear that all such systems attempting to map our (nonlinear) &quot;aural minds&quot;,<br/>and particularly the more descriptive approaches (which attempt to account for<br/>timbre over and above the sinusoid) are inherently subject to such<br/>nonlinearities in the case of *differing* amplitudes between two (or more)<br/>simultaneously sounded tones (whether sinusoidal or complex) to be.</p><p>As a result, not only will results be &quot;amplitude dependent&quot; (requiring<br/>evaluation at numerous loudness levels in order to &quot;complete the picture&quot;), but<br/>any distinct amplitude level &quot;mixes&quot; between the (sinusoidal or complex) tones<br/>to be analyzed must also be evaluated (individually, as well).</p><p>Such requirements, then, appear to require the necessary addition of human ears<br/>&quot;in the test loop&quot; for representative and accurate results to be determined in<br/>the course of testing any &quot;conceptual model&quot; (whether it involve sin/cos signals<br/>or complex signals with harmonic energies).</p><p>Humbled every day, J Gill :)</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2001 1:22:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
