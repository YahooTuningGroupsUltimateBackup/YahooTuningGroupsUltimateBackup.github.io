Wilson also explain very basic bedrock<br/>scales that are omitted in Rothenbergs case such as the pentatonics formed out of the<br/>diatonics. That it includes such scales as f a b c e.  That these exist historically cannot be<br/>overlooked. Another problem with the Rothenberg (out of just being not understandable to the<br/>average musician) is those scales which he thinks are of importance like the whole tone (and<br/>the other symmetrical scales shows) have had limited historical use. His aim is close but<br/>misses.<br/>    Along side MOS is the concept of Constant Structures defined as a tuning system where each<br/>interval occurs always subtended by the same number of steps. This in turn explains many just<br/>scales and even such things as to why and how Partch filled in the large areas of his tunings<br/>with smaller intervals.</p><p>Jason_Yust wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kraig,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Wilson&apos;s diagrams of scales generated by series of equal intervals<br/>&gt; elegantly show, I think, that the series of fifths (approximate 3/2&apos;s) are<br/>&gt; special in generating the most stable (in Rothenberg&apos;s sense) scales.

These properties are pretty<br/>similar to what Erv Wilson was getting at with his MOS idea, and as you can<br/>see in the Wilson archives and more recent explorations by Carl Lumma, Dave<br/>Keenan, and others, many acoustically unfavorable intervals, and/or<br/>intervals very far from a fifth or fourth, can be used as generators for<br/>scales which look favorable from an MOS/Balzano/Rothenberg point of view.</p></div>
