This sample is on a temporary link :</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/rs.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/rs.htm</a></p><p>Questions are :</p><p>(1) Paul, is it what you meant by the &quot;right stuff&quot; in a precedent message ?</p><p>(2) Jon, would you point the most repetitive word and expression errors ?</p><p>(3) How could I write (easily) mathematical symbols accepted by all<br/>platforms without I have to buy software or book ?</p><p>-Pierre</p></div><h3>Paul H.
