I just really like the low harpsichord-like buzz of bass strings on a Classical-era fortepiano:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMUb9nqnk8o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMUb9nqnk8o</a> (Mozart&apos;s Phantasy in C minor)</p><p>But since string tension, while much less than that of a modern piano, still has to be greater than in a harpsichord, the tuning sliders might have to apply the level principle... tuning machines of some sort, for instance. That would require more time and effort to retune a string, among other inconveniences.

They never sounded anything like a concert grand, of course, but they did have a fortepiano-like sound, so having pickups under strings would work well for this instrument, I&apos;d imagine.</p><p>And I hope there are eventual plans for an upright version of this thing. I&apos;d like one with the middle pedal lowering a felt shield for a muffled sound, like the Yamaha uprights have had...</p><p>~D.</p></div>
