It&apos;s great, thanks a lot! I&apos;m going to modify it a little and post again.</p><p>To anyone else who had trouble running Graham&apos;s file: I installed Csound on Windows to the default location (C:\Program Files\Csound), then moved Graham&apos;s file to Csound\bin (naming it with a .csd extension, e.g. &quot;breed.csd&quot;). Then at the command prompt I navigated to the correct folder (cd C:\progra~1\csound\bin) and typed the command &quot;csound breed.csd&quot;. The default operation writes the output to the soundcard rather than to a file. Sound doesn&apos;t start until you grab one of the sliders and move it.</p><p>Best --Jon Wild</p></div>
