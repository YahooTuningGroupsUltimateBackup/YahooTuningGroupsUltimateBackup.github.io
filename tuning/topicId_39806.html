You know Guy Murchie wrote a book called MUSIC OF THE<br/>SPHERES.  And I am sure you know the CONTENT of that book, in which he showed<br/>relationships, from his point of view, between the solar-planetary system and musical<br/>numbers.  Now: I have stated, and will repeat: I have friends who are musicians,<br/>and will never understand music like you musicologists.  But, you can understand<br/>something I cannot, and both of us can arrive on the same &quot;common ground&quot; and<br/>communicate.  We cannot dispute that Pythagoras already knew that six-sided stones,<br/>green, were emeralds, and eight-sided stones, clear, were diamonds.  First the MATH,<br/>and then the PHYSICS, or shall we say, physical explanation, taking Aristotle&apos;s<br/>definition in mind, came after the MATH was percieved.</p><p>Joe Monzo has a Pythagoras page.  Pythagoras, supposedly, created the Pythagorean<br/>Theory of the 2,3,5 triangle and all kinds of other theories about numbers.  Joe&apos;s<br/>page of Pythagoras speaks to you musicologists in ways it does not speak to me.<br/>It is about musical strings that sing!  Can you relate to that?  Because that<br/>is HOW Pythagoras explained it, seeing the distances in a series of numbers,<br/>whether planets or notes, they FELL at nautral numbers as Margo recently wrote.<br/>Now: I admit there are variant tunings, but we also know there ARE some tunings<br/>which are CLOSE to NAUTRAL WHOLE NUMBERS.  You all know this much better than I.<br/>But Pythagoras supposedly SAW in the spacing of the planets, which I believe he<br/>saw as &quot;octaval&quot; distances, remembering, only the visible planets were visible<br/>to him, the same spacing in certain scales in music called octaves.  Now, if you<br/>look at the MEAN data of the planets, and pick their closest IDEAL oribtal &quot;natural&quot;<br/>numbers, Sun 0, Mercury 1, Venus 2, Earth 3, Mars 4, etc., well, lo! and behold!<br/>Pythagoras APPEARS to be correct, and as Plato wrote, the REALITY does shadow<br/>the IDEAL.  Now: it was Pythagoras who expressed it METAPHORICALLY as the planets<br/>sing [shall we say they were &quot;knotted&quot; like a quipu at certain junctures in a string?]!<br/>I say quipu advisedly.  A &quot;quipu&quot; is a knotted string which based on the arrangement<br/>of the knots, their distances from each other, etc., actually communicated a message.<br/>Thus, a knotted string or a series of notes or a series of planets can be seen as<br/>a message.  In other words, I agree with Pythagoras that a knotted string can sing!<br/>Think of it as DNA or RNA--or note that if I write: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, someone will say,<br/>hey, that is BLANK in numbering system BLANK, etc.  And if I write: 2:3:4, musicologist<br/>have heart spasms, Margo thinking of the 1300s, and Joe Monzo thinking of Pythagoras,<br/>whereas a couch potato might go, &quot;Huh?&quot;  The quipu sings to those who see the MATH!</p><p>If Pythagoras were here, I think he would say, knowing of the newly discovered planets,<br/>and projecting the IDEAL based on their MEANS, that to PLAY the CHORD one must hit<br/>all the O, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. notes, which I GUESSED were C notes and 2 Fs.  I still<br/>cannot get an answer or a better guess.  For all I know they may be natural F# and<br/>Fb or Gb.  But then I do not know if they are natural anymore than I know that C is<br/>a natural note.  But really, Jon, it is the MATH underlying this all that fascinates<br/>me.  And I guess, if it fascinates Margo, and Joe Monzo, then it ought to fascinate<br/>ALL musicologists, particularly those who are TUNING and doing ADVANCED TUNING.<br/>Now, does that help?  I am trying as hard as I can to be clear and precise with<br/>words I could not master in musicology with twenty more years studying, and I am<br/>too old to give it that time as the good Lord probably will not grand me that many.<br/>So: can we get THERE [to an understanding] from HERE?</p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Y!

A static arrangement such as this is far from my view of music, unless I narrow down to what would actually be considered conceptual performance. If one wants to call this music, they may. I happen to still consider it relationships, or a tuning, or maybe a harmonization. And only if I were to feel poetic (with a license in my wallet) would I consider the orbits of the planets &apos;music&apos;.</p><p>The entire gang at celetial-tuning would probably disagree, apoplectically.</p><p>&gt; But really, Jon, it is the MATH underlying this all that<br/>&gt; fascinates me.

Not all tuning people are mathematicians, not all musicological tuning people are mathematicians, etc. I happen to be severely stunted in that area, but I thank good people on the list like Paul and Gene and Dave K. for giving me a greater understanding of how one can feel *exactly* as you do.</p><p>&gt; Now, does that help?

I have a better understanding of your position, and also it makes clear that I may not have much more in the way of helping you. But stick with the list, focus your questions (probably one or two per message would yield greater reponses), and just don&apos;t get discouraged if everyone doesn&apos;t see it the same way.
