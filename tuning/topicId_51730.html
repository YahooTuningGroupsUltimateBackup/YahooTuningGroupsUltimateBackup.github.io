Those whose interest<br/>lies mostly in tuning experiments rather than music may favor the<br/>third movement. I&apos;d forgotten this was rendered in all strings until<br/>I put it up. The second violin is taken by a fiddle font, but in most<br/>actual string quartets the two violins play separate instruments<br/>rather than trying to share one.</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/meantop.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/meantop.htm</a></p><p>I also have a version in Alaska 4 of Hindemith/Wagner, &quot;Overture to<br/>the &apos;Flying Dutchman&apos; as played at sight by a second-rate Concert<br/>Orchestra at the Village Well at 7 o&apos;clock in the morning&quot;. Anyone<br/>who objects to transcription should steer clear. Hindemith first<br/>transcribes Wagner for string quartet, an obvious amateur blunder I<br/>then attempt to correct.</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/alaska.htm">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/alaska.htm</a></p></div>
