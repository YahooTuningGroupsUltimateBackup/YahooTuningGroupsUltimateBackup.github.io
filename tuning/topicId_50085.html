Time and<br/>&gt; time again you refuse to provide any sound recordings at all to<br/>&gt; illustrate any of your esoteric ideas.</p><p>Since you know nothing really about what I and my musicians do in New York,<br/>you speak of a flat world in the guise of a scientist.  That&apos;s really<br/>scientific, Carl.  I have refused nothing.  The only issue is making these same<br/>recordings available to the greater public.  Take note:  there are no complaints I<br/>have heard from those familiar with what we do.</p><p>       I&apos;ve seen you perform live &gt; on several occasions and I have your<br/>&gt; album Raven and I claim the advertised accuracy of 1 cent everywhere is not even<br/>&gt; remotely<br/>&gt; demonstrated.</p><p>And here is an important distinction.  As a composer I care not a whit to<br/>create anything but a good work, not to demonstrate theoretical models.  As a<br/>performer I play all and any tunings, as a bassoonist, recorder player, and<br/>vocalist.  It doesn&apos;t phase me that some of that music (like much of Raven) is in a<br/>soup of tunings.  I do not play or compose so that Carl Lumma can examine the<br/>product in a laboratory to declare his judgments.  It is now 8 a.m. and I can<br/>still recall your ET brass quintet under the guise of JI on the first<br/>Microthon.)</p><p> Now you have another chance to provide an mp3 or &gt;<br/>&gt; something to back up your ego-crazed claims.</p><p>Carl, I don&apos;t have mp3 so I must be a charlatan, no?

Carl, feel free to<br/>theorize just as all are free to compose.  Performance is, however, more<br/>strictly received as people will howl at poor performances.</p><p>The reasons this surfaces again is because we are in a public forum.  You<br/>continue to deny the realities that you do not share and promulgate them.  That I<br/>hear a cent is as clear as day to me.  Read Seashore to find that hearing a<br/>single cent could be expected by a musician.  It&apos;s in the literature for almost<br/>a century.  And I can vocalize them, and play a line of them on a recorder.<br/>This is no more an ego-driven statement than devoting one&apos;s life to microtonal<br/>music performance.</p><p>You should shut up about what you know nothing about and avoid calling people<br/>names, as we all should.

It seems I am the only<br/>person on this list that performs microtonal music with flexible pitch.<br/>Rather than focusing on my history or accomplishments, let us focus on this alone.</p><p>As the single person that performs in all tunings and directs others to do so<br/>as well, I have a different take on the List&apos;s subjects.  It is not theory<br/>for someone in practice.</p><p>Now as for interrogation, testing, and Gabor&apos;s rite of punishment, I have<br/>this to say:</p><p>All my life people questioned what I could do in music:  no one believed I<br/>could play quartertones on a bassoon, for example.  When I played in Jon<br/>Catler&apos;s Microtones band in 31-tone ET a room of ethnomusicologists in the audience<br/>argued with me that there were no microtones to be heard (and that with a<br/>31-tone per octave fretted fingerboard).</p><p>New York has its own music world: here it is against union rules even to<br/>audition someone for a gig...less testing.  I hate tests, period.</p><p>However, I have demonstrated this issue of distinguising a single cent<br/>vocally (and instrumentally) to many microtonal luminaries.   Some people cannot<br/>hear these difference.  Last March I did a performance piece called &quot;Hearing a<br/>Cent&quot; and learned as a result that only a few people could distinguish a cent,<br/>let alone produce it.  This is similar to perfect pitch, as well as<br/>synaesthesia.</p><p>It does not anger me that people doubt me or complain about my releasing<br/>music to them.  What does anger me is when the amateur in music, or anywhere else<br/>(like government), audatiously expound upon these matter to others, even more<br/>naive than they are.</p><p>Cut the crap, already.  Of course some musicians hear better than<br/>non-professional music lovers.  Of course I hear better than most because of my work in<br/>directing microtonal music of all styles in different tunings.  Of course the<br/>work must stand up to analysis.  And when the 20 PITCH CDs do come out, there<br/>will plenty of analysis potential to go around.</p><p>But right now, I say Crap to taking tests, or to giving them.  All one needs<br/>to do is hold a single, unwavering pitch as the pure fifth above a tonic, and<br/>then to hold the 12-tET perfect fifth above the same tonic.  Then isolate the<br/>2 distinct pitches that are 2 cents apart (and mathematically smaller).<br/>Finally, place a pitch in between those 2 pitches, and one has single cent<br/>distinguishment.  Try it with your friends.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=50148 href="#50148">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2003 7:58:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_50085.html#50105">/tuning/topicId_50085.html#50105</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   A<br/>&gt; &gt; sine wave, or close to a sine wave, would be easiest to<br/>distinguish<br/>&gt; a specific<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch.

It seems I am the<br/>&gt; only person on this list that performs microtonal music with flexible<br/>&gt; pitch. Rather than focusing on my history or accomplishments, let us focus<br/>&gt; on this alone.</p><p>Can you be clear what you mean by &apos;flexible pitch&apos;? Anyone who sings or plays<br/>a violin uses &apos;flexible pitch&apos;. Early music players who lock onto a continuo<br/>part tuned to an 18th century tuning are by definition &apos;microtonalists&apos;.</p><p>&gt; As the single person that performs in all tunings and directs others to do<br/>&gt; so as well, I have a different take on the List&apos;s subjects.  It is not<br/>&gt; theory for someone in practice.</p><p>You seem to be taking a very defensive, ego-based approach to all of this.<br/>Lighten up, no one here is attacking your status; we are interested in<br/>evidence. You argument wouldn&apos;t stand up in a court right now. It&apos;s the<br/>fallacy of &apos;the argument from authority&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Now as for interrogation, testing, and Gabor&apos;s rite of punishment, I have<br/>&gt; this to say:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All my life people questioned what I could do in music:  no one believed I<br/>&gt; could play quartertones on a bassoon, for example.  When I played in Jon<br/>&gt; Catler&apos;s Microtones band in 31-tone ET a room of ethnomusicologists in the<br/>&gt; audience argued with me that there were no microtones to be heard (and that<br/>&gt; with a 31-tone per octave fretted fingerboard).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; New York has its own music world: here it is against union rules even to<br/>&gt; audition someone for a gig...less testing.  I hate tests, period.</p><p>Unfortunately for you, &apos;tests&apos; are routine in the world of science, and yours<br/>is a somewhat scientific claim with a somewhat simple demonstration. If you<br/>can do this, let&apos;s see. Until then, I take no one&apos;s word for it because they<br/>are in some sort of &apos;position of authority&apos;. In fact, it&apos;s less than<br/>professional to expect your fellow professionals to cave to your insulting<br/>insinuations that you are the only a) professional musician here, or b) the<br/>only qualified person who thinks and does these matters.</p><p>Or, that living in New York or not is at all relevant.</p><p>&gt; However, I have demonstrated this issue of distinguising a single cent<br/>&gt; vocally (and instrumentally) to many microtonal luminaries.   Some people<br/>&gt; cannot hear these difference.  Last March I did a performance piece called<br/>&gt; &quot;Hearing a Cent&quot; and learned as a result that only a few people could<br/>&gt; distinguish a cent, let alone produce it.  This is similar to perfect<br/>&gt; pitch, as well as synaesthesia.</p><p>Again, how do you *know* you were producing a cent diffrence? Subjective<br/>feelings do not count. Objective measures are important in this instance-I<br/>think that that was Carl&apos;s point.</p><p>&gt; It does not anger me that people doubt me or complain about my releasing<br/>&gt; music to them.  What does anger me is when the amateur in music, or<br/>&gt; anywhere else (like government), audatiously expound upon these matter to<br/>&gt; others, even more naive than they are.</p><p>This egoism of yours is getting off-putting. I&apos;m afraid the more defensive you<br/>get on this, the less I believe you-not that that&apos;s right, but it&apos;s my<br/>instinct. You assume you are corresponding with &apos;amateurs&apos;? Is anyone who<br/>would question your ability to hear a cent an amateur *by definition*?</p><p>&gt; Cut the crap, already.  Of course some musicians hear better than<br/>&gt; non-professional music lovers.  Of course I hear better than most because<br/>&gt; of my work in directing microtonal music of all styles in different<br/>&gt; tunings.  Of course the work must stand up to analysis.  And when the 20<br/>&gt; PITCH CDs do come out, there will plenty of analysis potential to go<br/>&gt; around.</p><p>So in summary: your argument is based solely on our being willing to take your<br/>word as an &apos;authority&apos;. You are as cynical and insulting as a John Ashcroft<br/>if that is what you believe. I&apos;m glad your not a politician if this is your<br/>response to being accountable to extraordinary claims (and you agree that the<br/>ability to hear and sing/play single cent gradations is extraordinary, else<br/>you wouldn&apos;t have put yourself in the elite category that you do.)</p><p>&gt; But right now, I say Crap to taking tests, or to giving them.</p><p>....and thus screw objective standards....<br/>A true fundamentalist. We just trust you, Jim Jones, that we should drink the<br/>poison!</p><p>&gt;  All one<br/>&gt; needs to do is hold a single, unwavering pitch as the pure fifth above a<br/>&gt; tonic, and then to hold the 12-tET perfect fifth above the same tonic.<br/>&gt; Then isolate the 2 distinct pitches that are 2 cents apart (and<br/>&gt; mathematically smaller). Finally, place a pitch in between those 2 pitches,<br/>&gt; and one has single cent distinguishment.  Try it with your friends.</p><p>Well, it&apos;s worth a shot. You may be right.</p><p>I tend to doubt it&apos;s even meaningful to say there exists such an animal as a<br/>&apos;single unwavering pitch&apos; in the vocal mechanism. I say that as a trained<br/>professional who has worked with professional singers for 12 years. Not that<br/>I would lower myself to arguments from authority....</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=50197 href="#50197">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>12/20/2003 1:50:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/20/03 3:07:29 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:akjmicro@comcast.net">akjmicro@comcast.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Can you be clear what you mean by &apos;flexible pitch&apos;?

There is no court<br/>outside of the music for me.  Hmm, &quot;argument from authority&quot; would seem to<br/>signify that someone placed me at a level that gave me a bully pulpit.  To me, I<br/>am only describing what I hear, which is somewhat more detailed than most<br/>people in my experience have had the occasion to accomplish.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now as for interrogation, testing, and Gabor&apos;s rite of punishment, I have<br/>&gt; &gt; this to say:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All my life people questioned what I could do in music:  no one believed I<br/>&gt; &gt; could play quartertones on a bassoon, for example.

None<br/>of us has any special authority other than that earned over the many years of<br/>posting.  The only exception to this is the set of individual accomplishments<br/>of each respondent with a myriad of areas of music interest.  Mine is in<br/>microtonal performance for the greatest variety of situations.  May I suggest to you<br/>that any &quot;position of authority&quot; is really a fabrication on your part?</p><p>In fact, it&apos;s less than &gt; professional to expect your fellow professionals to<br/>&gt; cave to your insulting<br/>&gt; insinuations that you are the only a) professional musician here, or b) the<br/>&gt;    only qualified person who thinks and does these matters.</p><p>Please, offer suggestions...who?  I am not insinuating anything.  It&apos;s like<br/>the difference between a surgeon and a chiropractor.</p><p>&gt; Again, how do you *know* you were producing a cent difference? Subjective<br/>&gt; feelings do not count. Objective measures are important in this instance-I<br/>&gt; think that that was Carl&apos;s point.</p><p>Aaron, there is no again, and it is no subjective as it is to doubt any of<br/>the intonation that I and my colleagues have made over the years.  Please don&apos;t<br/>penalize me for have put in years.</p><p>It&apos;s just that there is assurance by me that I can mete out an exact 3/2<br/>perfect fifth vocally.  I can limit the vibrato and tone so that I can give clean<br/>pitch signals.</p><p>I can also spout a masters degree in singing a perfect fifth  of 700 cents<br/>along with my peers at the Manhattan School of Music.  This is not too impress<br/>but to signify why my fairly useless diploma exists.  It was a requirement.  We<br/>had to sing an 12-tET Perfect fifth, mostly falling.</p><p>So, by isolating these two specific pitches, holding them so as to be<br/>measurable as a cent (and not a bandwidth of approximation), one has set up the<br/>melodic interval of 2 cents: a schisma.  By placing a single pitch between said<br/>schisma produces an adjacent cents scale, which can be continued sequentially,<br/>accordingly.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It does not anger me that people doubt me or complain about my releasing<br/>&gt; &gt; music to them.  What does anger me is when the amateur in music, or<br/>&gt; &gt; anywhere else (like government), audatiously expound upon these matter to<br/>&gt; &gt; others, even more naive than they are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This egoism of yours is getting off-putting. I&apos;m afraid the more defensive<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; get on this, the less I believe you-not that that&apos;s right, but it&apos;s my</p><p>&gt; instinct. You assume you are corresponding with &apos;amateurs&apos;? Is anyone who<br/>&gt; would question your ability to hear a cent an amateur *by definition*?</p><p>As a matter of fact, I have found people who can hear a cent that are not<br/>musicians, though also not on the List.  Talk about &quot;locking in,&quot; this is most<br/>pleasurable.  Its the kind of human cement that allows the unbelievably<br/>improvisations of more than 50 people as in my piece &quot;Odysseus.&quot;</p><p>About my egoism, again?  Well, I guess anything I say would be suspect at<br/>this point.  Hmmn, virtuoso player = egoistic?  Makes some sense... ( but is it<br/>measurable sense, or only some approximate bandwidth).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Cut the crap, already.  Of course some musicians hear better than<br/>&gt; &gt; non-professional music lovers.

Straight out of left field for me!</p><p>Actually it is a bit funny that you don&apos;t really understand, as it is for<br/>each of us on different issues.  It&apos;s so Socratic, &quot;No one knows what they don&apos;t<br/>know&quot; enough.  Better consider that it is more important to impress upon this<br/>List that the ear does here cents specific intonation.  Otherwise someone will<br/>eventually reduce its fine detail into some kind of Pentatonic version, and a<br/>huge loss for music expression.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But right now, I say Crap to taking tests, or to giving them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ....and thus screw objective standards....<br/>&gt; A true fundamentalist.

There is no court<br/>&gt; outside of the music for me.  Hmm, &quot;argument from authority&quot; would seem to<br/>&gt; signify that someone placed me at a level that gave me a bully pulpit.  To me, I<br/>&gt; am only describing what I hear, which is somewhat more detailed than most<br/>&gt; people in my experience have had the occasion to accomplish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We are all participants on an Internet List, some for many years now.  None<br/>&gt; of us has any special authority other than that earned over the many years of<br/>&gt; posting.  The only exception to this is the set of individual accomplishments<br/>&gt; of each respondent with a myriad of areas of music interest.  Mine is in<br/>&gt; microtonal performance for the greatest variety of situations.  May I suggest to you<br/>&gt; that any &quot;position of authority&quot; is really a fabrication on your part?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, it&apos;s less than &gt; professional to expect your fellow professionals to<br/>&gt; &gt; cave to your insulting<br/>&gt; &gt; insinuations that you are the only a) professional musician here, or b) the<br/>&gt; &gt;    only qualified person who thinks and does these matters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please, offer suggestions...who?  I am not insinuating anything.  It&apos;s like<br/>&gt; the difference between a surgeon and a chiropractor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again, how do you *know* you were producing a cent difference? Subjective<br/>&gt; &gt; feelings do not count. Objective measures are important in this instance-I<br/>&gt; &gt; think that that was Carl&apos;s point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron, there is no again, and it is no subjective as it is to doubt any of<br/>&gt; the intonation that I and my colleagues have made over the years.  Please don&apos;t<br/>&gt; penalize me for have put in years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s just that there is assurance by me that I can mete out an exact 3/2<br/>&gt; perfect fifth vocally.  I can limit the vibrato and tone so that I can give clean<br/>&gt; pitch signals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can also spout a masters degree in singing a perfect fifth  of 700 cents<br/>&gt; along with my peers at the Manhattan School of Music.  This is not too impress<br/>&gt; but to signify why my fairly useless diploma exists.  It was a requirement.  We<br/>&gt; had to sing an 12-tET Perfect fifth, mostly falling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, by isolating these two specific pitches, holding them so as to be<br/>&gt; measurable as a cent (and not a bandwidth of approximation), one has set up the<br/>&gt; melodic interval of 2 cents: a schisma.  By placing a single pitch between said<br/>&gt; schisma produces an adjacent cents scale, which can be continued sequentially,<br/>&gt; accordingly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It does not anger me that people doubt me or complain about my releasing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music to them.  What does anger me is when the amateur in music, or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anywhere else (like government), audatiously expound upon these matter to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; others, even more naive than they are.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This egoism of yours is getting off-putting. I&apos;m afraid the more defensive<br/>&gt; &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; get on this, the less I believe you-not that that&apos;s right, but it&apos;s my<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; instinct. You assume you are corresponding with &apos;amateurs&apos;? Is anyone who<br/>&gt; &gt; would question your ability to hear a cent an amateur *by definition*?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a matter of fact, I have found people who can hear a cent that are not<br/>&gt; musicians, though also not on the List.  Talk about &quot;locking in,&quot; this is most<br/>&gt; pleasurable.  Its the kind of human cement that allows the unbelievably<br/>&gt; improvisations of more than 50 people as in my piece &quot;Odysseus.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; About my egoism, again?  Well, I guess anything I say would be suspect at<br/>&gt; this point.  Hmmn, virtuoso player = egoistic?  Makes some sense... ( but is it<br/>&gt; measurable sense, or only some approximate bandwidth).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Cut the crap, already.  Of course some musicians hear better than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; non-professional music lovers.  Of course I hear better than most because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of my work in directing microtonal music of all styles in different<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tunings.  Of course the work must stand up to analysis.  And when the 20<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; PITCH CDs do come out, there will plenty of analysis potential to go<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; around.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So in summary: your argument is based solely on our being willing to take<br/>&gt; &gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; word as an &apos;authority&apos;. You are as cynical and insulting as a John Ashcroft<br/>&gt; &gt; if that is what you believe. I&apos;m glad your not a politician if this is your<br/>&gt; &gt; response to being accountable to extraordinary claims (and you agree that<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; ability to hear and sing/play single cent gradations is extraordinary, else<br/>&gt; &gt; you wouldn&apos;t have put yourself in the elite category that you do.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow, what a comparison.  Straight out of left field for me!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually it is a bit funny that you don&apos;t really understand, as it is for<br/>&gt; each of us on different issues.  It&apos;s so Socratic, &quot;No one knows what they don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know&quot; enough.  Better consider that it is more important to impress upon this<br/>&gt; List that the ear does here cents specific intonation.  Otherwise someone will<br/>&gt; eventually reduce its fine detail into some kind of Pentatonic version, and a<br/>&gt; huge loss for music expression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But right now, I say Crap to taking tests, or to giving them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ....and thus screw objective standards....<br/>&gt; &gt; A true fundamentalist. We just trust you, Jim Jones, that we should drink<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; poison!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow! Now its about religion!  And wow again, that you should equate drinking<br/>&gt; poison with what a leading exponent of microtonal performance is capable of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  All one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; needs to do is hold a single, unwavering pitch as the pure fifth above a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tonic, and then to hold the 12-tET perfect fifth above the same tonic.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then isolate the 2 distinct pitches that are 2 cents apart (and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematically smaller). Finally, place a pitch in between those 2<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and one has single cent distinguishment.
