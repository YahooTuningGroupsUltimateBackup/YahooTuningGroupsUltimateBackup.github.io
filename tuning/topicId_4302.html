What I see in my histograms are<br/>notes clustered around certain &apos;anchor&apos; sounds. The speculation in<br/>my previous post was based primarily on my observations when I was<br/>permitted to sit in masters classes in Turkey. I will know the answer<br/>to these very pertinent questions you have raised in due time. Thank<br/>for your interest in such musical structures.<br/>*****************************************************************</p><p>&gt;My recollection of R&apos;s book suggested that some tones are relative fixed<br/>&gt;and others quite flexible in their intonation (like the Greek fixed and<br/>&gt;moveable tones of the tetrachordal structure).

There are vast intervals<br/>between clusters with no musical &apos;action&apos;. I will definitely look at<br/>Rothenberg&apos;s theory for clues.
