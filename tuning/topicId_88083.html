When I tested narrower intervals on my keyboard in the past I always heard an annoying &apos;trill&apos; and so I ruled them out. I was using the wrong &apos;voice&apos;. Today I played a 9/8 interval but this time using a Church Organ &apos;voice&apos; on my keyboard and it not only sounded tolerable, but very sweet with no annoying trill. So 9/8 is in. I&apos;m not to hot about 10/9 though so at the moment, for me, 9/8 is the narrowest legal interval.</p><p>I&apos;ve gone a bit stricter on the tolerance for deviation from a &quot;perfect&quot; interval: 256/255 or 6.789 cents. As I said before, the next step is to temper my NPT scale to get the maximum number of good dyads.</p><p>My calculator should still work, just add &apos;x&apos; to the result. &apos;x&apos; will give the 9/8 a positive result and the 10/9 a negative result. In other words the hierarchy of intervals is still the same.</p><p>John.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 11:58:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Today I played a 9/8 interval but this time using a Church Organ &apos;voice&apos; on my keyboard and it not only sounded tolerable, but very sweet with no annoying trill.

At least this way you would cover most of the intervals used in chords for &quot;common practice music&quot;.<br/>  Admittedly, the use of ratios such as 11/10 and 12/11 are partly my own &quot;thing&quot;...as in I well realize that they are not part of common practice music which, ironically, makes them all that more intriguing to me to find ways to &quot;extend&quot; common practice music to include them.  Then again, as I, Chris, and several others have debated and agreed upon, even 15/14 (which has far more &quot;trill&quot; than something like 12/11) is used in &quot;common practice&quot; chords like inverted 7th but (at least so far as I&apos;ve seen) it&apos;s not used nearly as much as intervals like 9/8.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve gone a bit stricter on the tolerance for deviation from a<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; interval: 256/255 or 6.789 cents. As I said before, the next<br/>step is to temper my NPT scale to get the maximum number of good dyads.&quot;<br/>   That goes from virtually in-detectable to the untrained ear to virtually in-detectable to the trained ear.  To me the real challenge looks like how to make such a tempered system without running into standard 12-tone JI as your answer (since, to the best of my knowledge, 12-tone JI meets those conditions).  Not that it&apos;s impossible but it&apos;s a very hard thing to do...so many experts before you have had exactly the same goal so you have some pretty stiff competition.  As a side note, if you&apos;re looking toward maximizing the consonance of historical intervals (and only such intervals), it might be useful to look at and compare your work to things like 1/4 comma mean-tone, which do a very good job at said above tasks.  I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s impossible to compete with such tunings but that it&apos;s a realistic way to benchmark your system.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 3:12:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Something about this seems backwards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s being kind.</p><p>If you get rid of the goofy correction term, and simply sort rational numbers q in lowest terms according to the size of 1/numer(q)+1/denom(q), the practical result doesn&apos;t seem to be too greatly different from Tenney height, though I like Tenney (which for example rates 7/6 better than 9/5) better.
