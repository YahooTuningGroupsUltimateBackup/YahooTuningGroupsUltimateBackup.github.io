This so-called dominant 11th chord appears to be a polychord,<br/>mixing the important elements of both dominant and subdominant harmonies.<br/>The difference, of course, is the absence of the powerful tritone--the<br/>feature that makes this cadence sound so &quot;cool.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My own feeling is that the tritone is so unique in the diatonic scale, and<br/>&gt; resolves in such a convincing, poweful manner, that any diatonic-conditioned<br/>&gt; ears will &quot;get the idea&quot; regardless of the diminished fifth being 5:7, 7:10,<br/>&gt; or anywhere in-between (45:32 and 64:45 are fine too, though you could never<br/>&gt; tune them exactly by ear without tuning a few intermediary notes).</p><p>I won&apos;t argue with that.

Granted, it<br/>is easier when other pitches are included, but then one is likely tuning<br/>each tritone member to those other, more consonant, pitches.</p><p>Also, note that the keyboard&apos;s tritone is ambiguous until a context is<br/>provided.

The countless numbers of choirs singing<br/>12-tET tuning is testimony enough. My own missionary zeal is to awaken the<br/>choral community to the thrills of singing acoustically tuned music. I<br/>really found a time-removed soul mate in Herr Helmholtz when I read his<br/>similar feelings on the matter. In turn, it is gratifying to get feedback<br/>from my own readers who relate their similar kinship to this experience.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Very likely.

It contains both a major third and a higher<br/>minor third (and occasionally a &quot;blue&quot; flat 7). I think that&apos;s the one we&apos;re<br/>talking about. Right? He didn&apos;t say so, but I would imagine he would tune<br/>his strings to accommodate that configuration, since the chord doesn&apos;t<br/>change throughout the song.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve come to think that the traditional &quot;guitar chord&quot; representation of<br/>&gt;&gt;that chord has little to do with a raised ninth--rather contains both a<br/>&gt;&gt;major and minor third as well as a minor seventh (C-E-Bb-Eb). That view<br/>&gt;&gt;would support the notion that the upper third (b3) is a &quot;blue&quot; third<br/>&gt;&gt;(roughly a 6:7 interval to tonic) that tunes to the blue seventh (4:7 to<br/>&gt;&gt;tonic) as a perfect 3:4 fourth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s how I prefer to tune that chord when it&apos;s the tonic, as I discussed<br/>&gt; here before in response to Joe Monzo&apos;s 8:10:12:14:19 interpretation.</p><p>Yes!
