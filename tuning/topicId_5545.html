Bill Alves also made an excellent point:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;First, we certainly do not have to make a binary choice between free market<br/>&gt;&gt;and totalitarianism!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In a very important way, it&apos;s always a free market.  If there is an<br/>&gt;opressive &quot;Ministry of Culture&quot;, it has done something to survive -- large<br/>&gt;publishing companies such as Columbia/Sony (or whoever sat on Delusion for<br/>&gt;so many years) are acting as &quot;Ministries of Culture&quot; here.  Digital storage<br/>&gt;will soon take away their bread and butter, and we will see if they come up<br/>&gt;with something else to survive on.  As for the Ministries of Culture in<br/>&gt;Europe, more power to them -- I understand they&apos;ve done great things to<br/>&gt;earn their keep!</p><p>Frederick Hayek would insist that there is no stable middle ground between<br/>the free market and totalitarianism. He said that controls beget more<br/>controls. I think the relevant reference is &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;.</p><p>So, it&apos;s always a free market? Did Nazi Germany have a free market? Did the<br/>Soviet Union? If an oppressive institution has survived, obviously it has<br/>done something to survive. Namely, oppressing the people it should have<br/>been serving. What, for example, did Hitler&apos;s government do to survive for<br/>as long as it did? It certainly wasn&apos;t protecting the rights of its<br/>citizens.</p><p>John Link</p><p>John Link</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/1999 8:33:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Frederick Hayek would insist that there is no stable middle ground between<br/>&gt;the free market and totalitarianism.
