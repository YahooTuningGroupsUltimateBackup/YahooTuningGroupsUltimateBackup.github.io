There is no reason to not map it out in an way one can think of. If<br/>&gt; fact the more approaches beside stand ET and JI i think the better.</p><p>Yes, and the idea was to come up with another approach, and to make it so that it can<br/>stand on its own so that you don&apos;t need to keep translating everything into the<br/>standard approach and back again all the time (which is the way the<br/>infinitesimals are dealt with at present), but deal with them on their own terms.</p><p>As Gene said, it prob. won&apos;t have much influence on actual tuning theory.</p><p>1.0371550444461919<br/>itself is a ratio, if you write it as<br/>10371550444461919/1000000000000000</p><p>and the standard approach would be to treat it as an<br/>infinite expansion<br/>1.0371550444461919.......</p><p>I&apos;d treat it as<br/>1.0371550444461919.........12341378/1000000000000....000000<br/>where I&apos;ve added a tail to each one to make it into a ratio.<br/>In this ratio, only the head matters, and you can have<br/>anything in the tail - all of them will be treated as<br/>identical. So the practical implications are the same,<br/>the difference is in how one thinks about things,<br/>so philosophical, and also a certain elegance you get in the<br/>proofs of mathematical theorems using infinitesimals<br/>instead of limits.</p><p>The classical approach to infinitesimals<br/>gives exactly the same results as you get without them,<br/>so you just set up the maths, and you have all the<br/>classical results automatically.</p><p>With this approach you have to prove everything from<br/>scratch as you can&apos;t transfer results back and forth<br/>which is kind of interesting as one could get new<br/>results though in practice you seem to get all the<br/>same theorems as before. The idea originates in<br/>the work of a Czech mathematician Vopenka.</p><p>I still hope to go back to it some day and finish it for publication.</p><p>&gt; if you are asking how i would see this , I would say (being of a gestalt leaning psychology) I<br/>&gt; would say you have a 19 ET scale if you were superimposing this interval. My understanding is the<br/>&gt; mind will attempt to place any perception into its simplest form or combinations there of</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; One interesting feature i have found going the other direction with an ET being associated with an<br/>&gt; irrational (phi). If one forms an 13 MOS of this interval you end up with a close interval with<br/>&gt; the 12 ET semitone. Iy has made me wonder if all that circus music might be drawing upon this<br/>&gt; interpretation of this interval. What could be more turning our world upside down that giving a<br/>&gt; different meaning to what is already here.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting. I&apos;ve just had a go at making this MOS and the semitone is very close to 100 cents.</p><p>&gt; I think this type of difference might be of interest to Mayan Astronomers. In fact isn&apos;t this<br/>&gt; close to one revolution of the Milky way? or am i about 400 million short?</p><p>Sounds about right. I&apos;ll check it up.</p><p><a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/more/mw.html">http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/more/mw.html</a><br/>Yes, 220 million years for the rotation period.</p><p>&gt; One thing that has not been mentioned in there are assumption to JI that have not been touched<br/>&gt; upon and that is that the ratios will be used in certain ways and that lattices and this has been<br/>&gt; the practice so far. So while it is possible for some JI user to use 419914/404871 such an<br/>&gt; interval would be reached by the simpler intervals in between.<br/>&gt;     Lou Harrison mentioned that JI has only examined half of it universe in that it has been scale<br/>&gt; oriented as opposed to interval oriented. In the latter we would have a scale of intervals at hand<br/>&gt; regardless of weather it forms a cohesive whole or not. This for me is out of my interest in that<br/>&gt; i find expression in such structures that the intervals outline out.<br/>&gt; It seems possible to have an array of different ET scales or intervals or a matrix of any<br/>&gt; Irrationals from which to proceed through the continuum</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve come across quite a few ideas that can&apos;t be expressed in terms of a scale.<br/>In FTS, the fibonacci tonescapes are like that - they use pure ratios at present<br/>but one could develop the same idea using irrationals too. Anyway the music<br/>you make in the tonescapes couldn&apos;t be notated in any single scale with a small fintie<br/>number of intervals.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=38135 href="#38135">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2002 9:47:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>Yes it was slightly dead pan humour.
