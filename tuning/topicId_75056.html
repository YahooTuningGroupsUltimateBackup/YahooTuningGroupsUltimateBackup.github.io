Isn&apos;t it for whatever keyboard one happens to have handy?  It&apos;s always seemed quite a bit too big a piece to assign to the clavichord, IMO, although I practice it on clavichord sometimes anyway.  More often I play it on the more obvious choices of harpsichord and organ so it can be more extroverted and have some registration changes.</p><p>Here&apos;s a streamed video of me playing it on organ at St Olaf College, Sept 26th 2007:<br/><a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/multimedia/streams/archives/concertarchives/2007fall/index.html">http://www.stolaf.edu/multimedia/streams/archives/concertarchives/2007fall/index.html</a></p><p>...and when I get around to it I&apos;ll put up a competing performance from earlier that week, played on the Goshen College organ with the better tuning.  A nice thing about playing it on organ is that the pedal points really can be played by the pedal, for added power (and to facilitate some page turns in the fugue!).  It&apos;s such a big public piece of music.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
