I was delighted to find much microtonality<br/>in both the lectures and the musical examples.</p><p>The three presentations most relevant to this list were:</p><p>&quot;Poetics of Intercultural Synthesis: Gagaku in Postwar Art Music&quot;<br/>Yayoi Uno Everett, Emory University (Atlanta)</p><p>&quot;Shakuhachi and the American Composer&quot;<br/>Ralph Samuelson, Asian Cultural Council (New York)</p><p>&quot;Living Tones: Realization of Korean Musical Concept<br/>   for Western Instruments&quot;<br/>Jin Hi Kim (New York composer)</p><p>Yayoi presented a chart of the development of &quot;new music&quot; in<br/>Japan since 1900, and I was very interested to find that at<br/>the beginning of the last century, the most prominent influences<br/>on Japanese music (deliberately, by government decree) were<br/>from France and Germany.  This helped to explain my curiosity<br/>as to why Tanaka was studying with Helmholtz in Germany during<br/>the 1880s.  Yayoi was fascinated with this info when I mentioned<br/>it to her, and I&apos;m sure she will be doing research on it.  I&apos;ll<br/>post a follow up next time I hear from her.</p><p>Ralph gave a demonstration of meditative zen shakuhachi music<br/>(the first prominent use of shakuhachi, c. 900 AD) that was<br/>simply amazing.  I&apos;ve never heard a recording of shakuhachi<br/>playing that had anywhere near the impact of Ralph&apos;s live<br/>performance.  A real mind-blower.</p><p>(More on Jin below.)</p><p>There will be a half-hour concert tomorrow (Saturday, April 21)<br/>at Studio A in Warren Hall, UCSD:</p><p>Henry Cowell, _The Universal Flute_<br/>  Ralph Samuelson, shakuhachi</p><p>Chinary Ung, _Khse Buon_ (short version)<br/>  Hugh Livingston, cello</p><p>Jin Hi Kim, _Portrait_<br/>  Jin Hi Kim, komungo</p><p>Christopher Adler, _Three Body Problem_<br/>  Christopher Adler, khaen; Hugh Livingston, cello</p><p>Edgard Var&egrave;se, _Density 21.5_<br/>  John Fonville, flute</p><p>I know for sure that the first three will be microtonal.<br/>I&apos;m especially looking forward to Jin&apos;s piece - she played<br/>excerpts of it at her presentation today.  The komungo is<br/>a Korean instrument vaguely similar to the koto.</p><p>The concert will be followed by a nearly two-hour talk by<br/>Chou Wen-chung, a terrific composer (as well as extraordinarily<br/>interesting personality) whom I&apos;ve only just discovered at<br/>these events, and who is apparently the keynote speaker of<br/>this conference.</p><p>AFAIK, this is the last day of events.<br/>(I could be wrong: contact UCSD to be sure.)</p><p>I encourage everyone within reasonable distance to attend!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com">http://www.ixpres.com</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21380 href="#21380">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2001 7:08:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21361.html#21361">/tuning/topicId_21361.html#21361</a></p><p>&gt; &quot;Living Tones: Realization of Korean Musical Concept<br/>&gt;    for Western Instruments&quot;<br/>&gt; Jin Hi Kim (New York composer)</p><p>Oops... my bad.
