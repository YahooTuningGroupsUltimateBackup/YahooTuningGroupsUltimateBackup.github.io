Here&apos;s a fairly<br/>typical, and provocative, excerpt for anyone who might be interested:</p><p>&quot;...we must recall that:</p><p>    four centuries ago, Luca Marenzio (1553-1599) wrote     madrigals<br/>that could have been written by a Richard     Strauss; Hans Neusiedler<br/>(1508-1563) in The Jew&apos;s         Dance and Mozart in A Musical Joke-as<br/>both composers     wrote with satirical purpose in mind-gave two clear<br/>signals in their respective centuries so as to be         literally<br/>considered the forerunners of bitonality;     both Chopin and Lizst,<br/>each intending to expand         tonality, wrote ostensible passages<br/>in a frank             atonality; Giovanni Battista Vitali (1644-1692)<br/>fully     constructed the cyclical form of the sonata, two<br/>centuries before C&iuml;&iquest;&half;sar Franck accomplished it in his     Sonata in A<br/>for piano and violin; it is Ernest Fanelli     (1860-1919), not<br/>Debussy, who some acknowledged as the     father of musical<br/>Impressionism; the unfairly             forgotten Pietro Raimondi<br/>(1786-1853) deliberately and     systematically wrote an ingenious<br/>collection of fugues     in four and six simultaneous tonalities,<br/>apart from     his Three Oratorios In One, juxtaposing contrary<br/>tempos and meters, long before Milhaud (or even Bart&iuml;&iquest;&half;k     or Ives)<br/>began to experiment with polytonality and         Stravinsky, Carter,<br/>and Blacher, with polymeter,         metric modulation and variable<br/>meters, respectively;     the virtuoso pianist Charles Kunkel<br/>(1840-1923) used a     tone cluster effect in his work, Alpine Storm<br/>(1888),     before Charles Ives used this effect in 1911 in the<br/>second movement of his Concord Sonata, and before         Henry<br/>Cowell-its principal user-coined the term in         1915; a Clavecin<br/>Oculaire, invented in 1734 by Louis-    Bertrand Castell (1688-1757),<br/>preceded by almost two     centuries the synaesthetic inventions of<br/>sound and         color that Scriabin exhibited in his Prometheus<br/>(1910); microtonality, since its extinction in Greek     antiquity,<br/>reemerged systematized by the astronomer     Christiaan Huygens<br/>(1629-1695) in his Tricesimorprimal     Temperament, many times before<br/>Jacques Hal&iuml;&iquest;&half;vy             practiced microtonality in his cantata,<br/>Prom&iuml;&iquest;&half;thee         Encha&iuml;&iquest;&half;n&iuml;&iquest;&half; (1847), and before Richard Stein<br/>(1882-1942),     Alois H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ba (1893-1973), and Juli&iuml;&iquest;&half;n Carrillo (1875-<br/>1965) with his Sonido 13, made their first experiments<br/>fractionalizing the octave into several microtones of     different<br/>values; as trustworthy sources indicate, it     was Charles Ives who<br/>originally conceived of the         twelve-tone technique before<br/>Schoenberg (or even Josef     Matthias Hauer); in 1914, Erik Satie<br/>instructed that     sheets of paper be inserted between piano strings<br/>in     Le pi&iuml;&iquest;&half;ge de M&iuml;&iquest;&half;duse, and Rued Langgaard (1893-1952)<br/>instructed that a glissando be played on the piano         strings in<br/>Sfaerernes musik (1918), before John Cage     (following Cowell&apos;s<br/>experiments, respectively) could     have embodied all these ideas in<br/>his Prepared Piano or     Klaviergamelan (1940), whose<br/>industrialization and         universality were owing to the<br/>inventions by its         performer and promoter, Richard Burger<br/>(q.v.:             Burgerack, Pianotation, and so forth); Ravel&apos;s<br/>Bol&iuml;&iquest;&half;ro     should be considered the true forerunner of<br/>minimalism, a work that features all the components of     this style;<br/>and that Mozart, again, amusing himself,     threw the dice to vary<br/>the order of a group of             numbered measures, long before<br/>John Cage, Karlheinz     Stockhausen, and many other composers were to<br/>write     aleatoric music in our day.</p><p>The challenging character of these historic events, however, should<br/>not alter our wise evaluation of the matter at hand: In art, the<br/>paternity of an aesthetic idea is not consequently attributed to who,<br/>by hazard or intent, originates the essence of the idea, but to<br/>who-regardless of claims to origination-develops the idea to its<br/>consecration.&quot;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.ubieta.com/bio.htm">http://www.ubieta.com/bio.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2000 1:46:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
