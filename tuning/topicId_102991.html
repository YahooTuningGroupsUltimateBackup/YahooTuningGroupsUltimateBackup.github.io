In fact, that&apos;s basically what<br/>I&apos;ve been trying to get at: that dissonance is an extremely complex,<br/>multidimensional phenomenon, and that it&apos;s better to separate the<br/>constituent components and describe them directly when possible,<br/>rather than referring to overall &quot;dissonance.&quot; Of course, dissonance<br/>isn&apos;t the word you use - it&apos;s discordance. And sometimes I feel like<br/>when you and Igs are talking about &quot;discordance,&quot; you guys are lumping<br/>a number of dimensions together, and a number of others you&apos;re<br/>excluding, and it&apos;s not at all clear to me which ones you&apos;re throwing<br/>in there or if you guys are even using the same ones. For instance,<br/>David Huron has 14 theories of dissonance listed here, as well as 2<br/>conjectures</p><p><a href="http://musicog.ohio-state.edu/Music829B/main.theories.html">http://musicog.ohio-state.edu/Music829B/main.theories.html</a></p><p>and I doubt this is anywhere near a complete list. You&apos;ll note that<br/>two of them are &quot;interval category dissonance&quot; and, apparently,<br/>&quot;absolute pitch category dissonance.&quot; In this case, we&apos;re talking<br/>about some kind of AP category dissonance paired with a different kind<br/>of intonational consonance. Does the AP category dissonance count<br/>towards &quot;discordance?&quot; Does it count when you talk about fields of<br/>attraction? If your operational definition is what Keenan said, then I<br/>don&apos;t see why not, but then that limits the extent to which you can<br/>say that fields of attraction can&apos;t be conditioned.</p><p>But at this point, it just seems like we&apos;re discussing how to define<br/>&quot;fields of attraction&quot; in a sensible way. This is why I tried,<br/>unsuccessfully, to introduce the notion of us talking about very<br/>specific psychoacoustic things that aren&apos;t ambiguous. Maybe it really<br/>is that everyone&apos;s in on some commonly accepted viewpoint about what<br/>these concepts mean, but I don&apos;t get it. What I do have is an internal<br/>understanding of at least a few things that are unambiguous to me, and<br/>which Paul and I have discussed thoroughly at length in person and on<br/>the phone, and which he seems to agree with, for the most part - so if<br/>I&apos;m a nihilist, he&apos;s evil like me too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I get that your &quot;fields of attraction&quot; have to do with people<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning things by ear until they subjectively say that they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; maximally &quot;in tune.&quot; And I also get that you claim that they<br/>&gt; &gt; can&apos;t be changed via any training that anyone can engage in<br/>&gt; &gt; while living a normal life.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The edges might move around, but 21:16 is not going to be<br/>&gt; rated more &quot;in tune&quot; than 3:2. Green will not turn to red.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how to evaluate this sentence in any other way than<br/>psychoacoustically. But, if we continue with the notion that<br/>categorical ambiguity can it be its own type of dissonance, this is<br/>probably not true. For example, consider someone who had a categorical<br/>perception built around 13-EDO: 3/2 would be pretty far off what<br/>anyone was used to, whereas 21/16 would be pretty close to it. How do<br/>you know that someone used to 13-EDO might think the sound of 3/2 is<br/>interesting, but that extremely trained 13-EDO musicians would just<br/>say it &quot;blends too much&quot; or otherwise express displeasure that it&apos;s<br/>not the thing they know? At least until they&apos;ve untrained and<br/>retrained themselves, anyway.</p><p>And that&apos;s just one shoot from the hip example off the top of my head.<br/>Here&apos;s a different example maybe even Gene will appreciate: something<br/>like 11/8 is a local maximum of Harmonic Entropy, is it not? How about<br/>13/10? And yet people who play a lot of 13-limit harmony often some to<br/>enjoy these intervals quite a bit, sometimes even preferring them to<br/>ratios nearby (as in Gene&apos;s case, who rated the difference between<br/>13/10 and 22/17 as being a &quot;3&quot; out of 5, where 5 is the most different<br/>and 1 is almost imperceptibly different). People who haven&apos;t played<br/>around as much with JI sometimes don&apos;t respond the same way. Why is<br/>this?</p><p>I can spit out arbitrarily many theories for why it is, ranging from<br/>changing the HE &quot;s&quot; value to categorizing new intervals to whatever<br/>half-assed hypotheses you want me to concoct, but who cares why it is?<br/>I have no answer to any of these questions, but I do know that the<br/>effect happens, full stop. And I&apos;ve observed in myself and a number of<br/>musicians that the subjective quality of &quot;out of tuneness&quot; can be<br/>conditioned to correspond to psychoacoustic &quot;discordance,&quot; or<br/>categorical ambiguity, or the presence of beating where you don&apos;t<br/>expect it, or any number of things, which you can prioritize as<br/>important in any arbitrary way that you want - or you might not even<br/>be sure how to prioritize them at all, if different factors which<br/>you&apos;re used to being correlated suddenly decorrelate in a novel<br/>tuning.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103009 href="#103009">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2012 10:27:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It sounds like Keenan&apos;s definition could include categorical...</p><p>It&apos;s hardly my definition.
