June 11th, 2011<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;I used to be active posting to the Tuning List about 10 years ago &gt; but have since then gotten to being much less active, and have &gt; contributed posts much less frequently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;However I&apos;ve been developing a fairly specific system for &gt; organizing the pitch/harmonic side of music one is studying or &gt; composing which I believe has value and deserves the attention of &gt; musicians (composers, teachers, music lovers).......     &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>**********************************</p><p>&gt; &#x9;I hope some will give me the benefit of their thoughts as to the &gt; suitability of my getting a draft of my thoughts on an organized way &gt; of thinking about musical pitch/harmony which could form a &gt; replacement (or core of a replacement) for the current compound of &gt; common practice quarter comma mean tone systematization confusingly &gt; subposed beneath the 12 equal pitch step per octave 20th century &gt; piano tuning system which makes no distinction (the latter) between &gt; the 24/25 frequency ratio chromatic semitone (eg E-flat to E) and &gt; the 15/16 frequency ratio diatonic semitone found in the step E to &gt; F.  THINK OF THE MELODY STARTING ON C FOR &quot;I&apos;M DREAMING OF A WHITE &gt; CHRISTMAS&quot;</p><p>&gt;   Melody starts on E, not C.  C is tonic.</p><p>&gt; - the upward step between the 1st and 2nd note of the melody &gt; (diatonic semitone) and the downward step between the 3rd and 4th &gt; notes of the melody (chromatic semitone)  (or upward again between &gt; the 4th and 5th notes of the melody (again chromatic semitone)).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;Best wishes, Ralph David Hill</p></div>
