I&apos;m lazy; keeping track of that extra info is a pain.  I play in<br/>     real-time and measure in thousanths of a second.</p><p>   . I don&apos;t usually need a score, so who cares?</p><p>   . Using the midi scheme can distort the timing of the piece.</p><p>This last point is the one that most concerns me.  Rubato can be<br/>achieved using tempo meta-events, true, but what about the slight<br/>rolling of a chord, or other not-quite-simultaneous striking of keys<br/>which (as long as it&apos;s not excessive) adds to the performance?<br/>Squeezing many notes into the same time does make the sound more<br/>precise, but music isn&apos;t always about precision.</p><p>One can of course subdivide the midi beat and achieve the same thing,<br/>but doesn&apos;t that defeat the point of using midi timing?  Or are<br/>score-making programs clever about interpreting such tricks without<br/>adding 1/128th notes, etc.?</p><p>Now a confession: those retunings of your midi sequences that I e-mailed<br/>you today, heh heh, have LOST the midi timing information; SORRY!  I<br/>like your Springtime Rag, by the way...</p><p>JdL</p></div>
