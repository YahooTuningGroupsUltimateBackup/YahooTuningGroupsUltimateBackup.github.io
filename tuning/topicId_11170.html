Briefly, Carl Sauter<br/>&gt; Pianos is the oldest continuous production piano company in the world,<br/>&gt; located in Germany in the same town since 1819.  It is a small but very<br/>&gt; high<br/>&gt; quality, innovative company which builds the most beautiful hand-crafted<br/>&gt; pianos I personally have ever seen or played, and we import their<br/>&gt; traditional<br/>&gt; as well as a line of designer pianos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Early this week, at the Piano Technicians Guild convention in Washington<br/>&gt; D.C.<br/>&gt; I was introduced for the first time to an acoustic piano which we<br/>&gt; persuaded<br/>&gt; Ulrich Sauter (the sixth generation Sauter to run the company) to bring<br/>&gt; from<br/>&gt; Germany to the show mainly as a &quot;novelty&quot; to get the piano technicians<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt; the booth to see the other pianos in our line, and to generate<br/>&gt; conversation<br/>&gt; Germany to the show mainly as a &quot;novelty&quot; to get the piano technicians<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt; the booth to see the other pianos in our line, and to generate<br/>&gt; conversation<br/>&gt; about Sauter.  Little did I know what we had on our hands.  It turns out<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; Ulrich&apos;s father was contacted in the 1950s by a microtonal composer named<br/>&gt; Julian Carillo (&lt;A<br/>&gt; HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.tol.itesm.mx/~esolisw/julian.html">http://www.tol.itesm.mx/~esolisw/julian.html</a>&quot;&gt;Julian<br/>&gt; Carrillo and the Thirteenth Sound&lt;/A&gt;) to build a 96 key acoustic piano<br/>&gt; built<br/>&gt; around the 16 tone system.  Carrillo had been looking for a piano<br/>&gt; manufacturer who would build him one of these pianos and after being<br/>&gt; &quot;politely&quot; turned down by every company (Steinway, Baldwin , etc.) he<br/>&gt; found<br/>&gt; Sauter enthusiastic to build it.  About 15 of the &quot;metamorphser&quot; pianos<br/>&gt; were<br/>&gt; built and made their way to Mexico and to various conservatories around<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; world.  They fell into obscurity until recently when Sauter was contacted<br/>&gt; by<br/>&gt; the Paris Conservatory to build two of these pianos for them.  After quite<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; bit of research, Sauter was able to find in their archives the original<br/>&gt; plans, sketches, etc., and therefore took on the commission.  Since then,<br/>&gt; orders have been coming out of the &quot;woodwork&quot; from different parts of the<br/>&gt; world, mostly Europe, and Sauter has filled another 7 orders.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason that I am writing to you is to convey the unanticipated<br/>&gt; enthusiasm<br/>&gt; I encountered from Piano Technicians at this convention towards this<br/>&gt; &quot;micortone&quot; piano which has 96 keys but only covers a one octave range of<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; conventional piano, especially those tech&apos;s associated with Universities<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; Conservatories.  We will most likely come away with several serious<br/>&gt; commissions to build more which will be ending up in the United States.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I really don&apos;t know where this will lead to; I&apos;m still trying to sort it<br/>&gt; out<br/>&gt; myself, and I found your website while trying to find out more about<br/>&gt; microtonal music which I&apos;ve had no experience with until seeing this<br/>&gt; piano.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know if any of this interests you, but I want to make myself<br/>&gt; available for any information that you may wish to know and which I can<br/>&gt; supply you.  I will have the piano in the U.S. for a while.  It is<br/>&gt; currently<br/>&gt; still in Washington D.C. for the convention and we will be bringing it to<br/>&gt; our<br/>&gt; distribution headquarters in Melbourne, Florida this coming Monday.<br/>&gt; Sauter<br/>&gt; is here from Germany and will be in Florida next week from Monday -<br/>&gt; Wednesday.  In the meantime, I&apos;m going to find out more about this<br/>&gt; microtonal<br/>&gt; music because I am fascinated by it, and it seems to me that Sauter and we<br/>&gt; have something really special, not just a novelty after all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt; John Ryan<br/>&gt; Europianos (a division of Unique Pianos)<br/>&gt; Import and Distribution of Fine Quality Hand Crafted Pianos</p><p>John Ryan might be interested to know that a 96-tet Sauter piano from the<br/>heritage of Jean-Etienne Marie is now in the possesion of the Mus&eacute;e de la<br/>Musique in Paris. The instrument has been bought at a public sale for the<br/>museum by Jean-Claude Battault, e-mail: <a href="mailto:jcbattault@gwmail.cite-musique.fr">jcbattault@gwmail.cite-musique.fr</a></p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
