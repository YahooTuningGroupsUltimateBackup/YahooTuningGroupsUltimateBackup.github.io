It disagreed on the filenames so I renamed the files. 1 and 3<br/>&gt;swapped numbers and unnumbered became 4. This is a more logical order.<br/>It<br/>&gt;corresponds to the order in which you described them to the list. I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt;suppose it matters since each chart is well labelled internally.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, you can now just go to <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich</a></p><p>That should answer John Starrett&apos;s question, except that for some reason<br/>one of the four graphs disappeared. Perhaps Joe or Dave thought it<br/>wasn&apos;t too important? I&apos;m OK with that. There are many more graphs to<br/>come.</p><p>Anyhow, the second to last line of the page, and the third to last line<br/>of the last indented segment, should say numerator + denominator &lt; N,<br/>instead of numerator + denominator &lt; 2N, since the graph that says &quot;Mann<br/>series N=112&quot; was defined that way.</p><p>I notice that my page still links to the old tuning digest posts,<br/>without Joe&apos;s commentary and without the graphs. I like that, but maybe<br/>the two versions of the page should be linked to one another?</p></div>
