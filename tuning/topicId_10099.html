Werckmeister is one man who decided to try to find a better way<br/>to tune.  I think that it gets into, again, we are back to science when we<br/>start to talk about which is the best tuning and what&apos;s the difference<br/>between them.  For me it&apos;s the experience of the sound.<br/>I have a student who is always experimenting with tuning.  One day I talked<br/>to him and I told him, &quot;Okay, that&apos;s enough games, now someone gives you an<br/>instrument and it&apos;s tuned by Sears and you can&apos;t tune it again, and you have<br/>to make music on it.&quot;  So I think I would like to say.....there&apos;s even a<br/>club, a society for non-tempered tuning.  You can get something in the mail<br/>and it tells you where all the concerts are for things that have non-tempered<br/>tunings.  Well, these people are as crazy as the ignorant people who don&apos;t<br/>know about different tunings.<br/>So, for me, this is what happens.  I&apos;m in the room and there&apos;s something that<br/>makes a sound, I will deal with that.  I will not say ...unless it&apos;s really<br/>out of tune, I won&apos;t say &quot;Bad!!&quot; &quot;No, that&apos;s not right.&quot;  I will have to use<br/>it.<br/>The Pygmies don&apos;t ask if their drums are tuned in equal-tempered or<br/>Werckmeister.....<br/>I&apos;m very aware of these tunings, I mean I know about them.  We could talk<br/>about them but I have nothing really to say about them.<br/>But I can tell you a funny story about Lou Harrison&apos;s Piano Concerto.  I<br/>played at Carnegie Hall, so Steinway had to give us a piano to use.  There<br/>was another piano but since they tune it differently, they had to keep both.<br/>They had one tuned to the piece and one tuned for regular pianists.  Steinway<br/>knew about this and when I went to see the piano, they said something about<br/>&quot;We are worried about the bad reviews.&quot;  And I said, &quot;What?  What do you<br/>mean?&quot;  They said, &quot;Well, people are gonna say that the piano didn&apos;t sound<br/>good.  And they will know this is a Steinway.....Because it&apos;s tuned<br/>differently it won&apos;t sound good.&quot;<br/>I said, &quot;That&apos;s not your problem, that&apos;s the composer&apos;s.....&quot;(laughs)  But<br/>they were worried because of this different tuning, people are gonna say,<br/>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t think that piano is very good.&quot; (laughs) I had to keep saying,<br/>&quot;It&apos;s okay, it&apos;s okay, don&apos;t worry.&quot; (laughs)<br/>There are only a few men still alive who compose in a way that I feel close<br/>to.  Lou is one of them.  Alan Hovhaness is another one.  And then Samuel<br/>Barber is dead, but, I like some of his things.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=10122 href="#10122">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@con2.com</h3><span>5/21/2000 7:58:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;From an autobiography of Keith Jarrett published only in Japanese and Italian:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(You&apos;ve used Werckmeister tuning?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Keith Jarrett:  ...So, for me, this is what happens.

Certainly<br/>melodic tuning, is not super important. As long as an expected<br/>system is sufficiently approximated, a listener will fill in the gaps.<br/>Harmonic tuning is the more interesting question and a music<br/>which sufficiently distinguishes between 81:80 and 5:4 to be<br/>a meaningful musical event may have to sacrifice other things,<br/>like complex melodies, forms or rhythms, to make that<br/>subtlety stand out.</p><p>Believe me, I don&apos;t know the answer to this question.
