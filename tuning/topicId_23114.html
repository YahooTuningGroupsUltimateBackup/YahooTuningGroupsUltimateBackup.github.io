But<br/>following my explanation should shed some light on how<br/>MIDI tuning and pitch-bend works.</p><p>I&apos;m going to explain four numbering systems that all<br/>have a bearing on learning how to use the MIDI tuning<br/>specification:</p><p>1. decimal       base_10<br/>2. binary        base_2<br/>3. hexadecimal   base_16<br/>4. octal         base_8</p><p>Think in terms of a prime-factor vector, which you&apos;ve<br/>seen me (and Graham Breed) use here many times before.<br/>This use of a prime-factor vector was the confusing<br/>aspect of my HEWM notation which you cited from my<br/>paper a couple of months back, where I omit the primes<br/>themselves and just string the exponents out in a series.</p><p>Understanding bits and bytes is similar to this.</p><p>The difference is that instead of representing exponents<br/>of prime-factors, the numbers represent values of the<br/>base-number raised to successive exponents.</p><p>Different numbering systems<br/>---------------------------</p><p>For example, let&apos;s start with the system you&apos;re most<br/>familiar with: decimal, also called base_10.<br/>Of course I realize everyone understands this, but<br/>it&apos;s necessary to spell out the procedure.</p><p>There are 10 decimal digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.<br/>These can be thought of as indicating the value of a<br/>number of individual &quot;units&quot;.</p><p>When we&apos;ve used up all 10 digits and must continue<br/>counting, how do we do it?</p><p>We imagine that these numbers may appear in a &quot;place&quot;<br/>which has a specific meaning: that each place refers<br/>to an exponent of the base number, and any digit in that<br/>place indicates the value of that exponent.</p><p>So to get to the number &quot;ten&quot;, simply form a new place<br/>to the left of the original one and make that place<br/>represent not units but &quot;tens&quot;.  In math, the difference<br/>is indicated by:  unit = 10^0, ten = 10^1.  So placing<br/>a &quot;1&quot; in the &quot;tens&quot; place indicates 1 &quot;ten&quot;, or simply 10.<br/>The zero in the units place shows that the total value<br/>is only 10 and not more than 10.</p><p>Then we cycle thru the units place again until we reach<br/>19, and then go back to zero in the units and bump the<br/>tens up to 2, with the result of 20.  Etc., etc.<br/>The next place to the left is 100s (= 10^2), the next<br/>to the left of that 1000s (= 10^3), etc.</p><p>So in other words the number 111, for example, really means:</p><p>  (10^2)+(10^1)+(10^0)</p><p>=  100  +  10  +  1</p><p>=  111.</p><p>Now on to binary, also called base_2.</p><p>There are only 2 binary digits: 0 and 1.  The reason<br/>why this is so effective for use in computers is because<br/>electronic switches can relay data by means of being in<br/>one of either of two states: on or off.</p><p>The word &quot;bit&quot; is a contraction of the two words<br/>&quot;b-inary dig-it&quot;.  A &quot;byte&quot; is an 8-digit binary string.</p><p>So how do we get any bigger numbers than 2 in binary?<br/>Easy... the same way as in the decimal system.</p><p>Each place to the left will be a higher exponent of 2.</p><p>So the right-most place is 2^0 = 1, then next to the left<br/>is 2^1 = 2, the next is 2^2 = 4, the next is 2^3 = 8, etc.</p><p>So we cycle thru the whole set by placing first a zero,<br/>then a one, in each successive place:</p><p>binary  decimal</p><p>   0  = 0<br/>   1  = 1<br/>  10  = 2<br/>  11  = 3<br/> 100  = 4<br/> 101  = 5<br/> 110  = 6<br/> 111  = 7<br/>1000  = 8</p><p>etc.</p><p>So, for example, the number 7 [decimal] is represented<br/>in binary as with &quot;1&quot;s filling the first three places:</p><p>  (2^2)+(2^1)+(2^0)</p><p>=   4  +  2  +  1</p><p>=   7</p><p>The next number, 8 [decimal], divides evenly into<br/>the third power of 2, so it has a &quot;1&quot; filling the<br/>2^3 place and zeros in all the others.</p><p>The next number system I&apos;ll discuss is hexadecimal,<br/>or hex for short, also called base_16.</p><p>Long strings of 1s and 0s are difficult to comprehend<br/>visually, so hex is used by programmers as a convenient<br/>shorthand for binary.  Its combination of numbers and<br/>letters is much easier for humans to parse.</p><p>In this system, each place can hold numbers which<br/>represent 0 thru 15.  But we need to keep our &quot;digits&quot;<br/>to, obviously, a single digit, so we invoke the first<br/>few letters of the alphabet after we pass 9.</p><p>Let&apos;s continue counting from the table above, this<br/>time with the results in hex rather than decimal (you<br/>only see a difference after 9).  I&apos;ll give the decimal<br/>value at the end, just so you can see what it is:</p><p>binary  hex   decimal</p><p>1001  =  9<br/>1010  =  A  =  10<br/>1011  =  B  =  11<br/>1100  =  C  =  12<br/>1101  =  D  =  13<br/>1110  =  E  =  14<br/>1111  =  F  =  15</p><p>Because 1 hex digit can represent exactly 4 binary digits,<br/>this is sometimes found to be a useful grouping, and is<br/>called a &quot;nibble&quot; (I&apos;ve also seen it spelled &quot;nybble&quot;).<br/>A nibble is exactly half a byte... get it?</p><p>I&apos;m mentioning nibbles here because they play a role<br/>in understanding how the MIDI tuning spec uses the data<br/>contained in each byte of a signal.  I&apos;ll use nibble-size<br/>binary groupings below to illustrate the hex numbers that<br/>we&apos;ll come across.</p><p>Also note that it&apos;s easy to specify binary strings<br/>of 1s in decimal format by bumping up to the next<br/>higher power of 2 and using &quot;-1&quot;.  For example,<br/>our last number in the above table, 1111 [binary]<br/>= 10000 [binary] minus 1, or in decimal, (2^4)-1<br/>= 16 - 1 = 15, which = F in hex.</p><p>After F [hex], which = 15 [decimal], we get to<br/>16 [decimal] by using the same procedure as before:<br/>bump up to the next higher exponent of 16 and start<br/>over again.  So a &quot;1&quot; in the next higher place means<br/>16^1, and in the next higher place after that, 16^2, etc.</p><p>So the highest 2-digit number in hex is FF [hex],<br/>which equals</p><p>  (15 * (16^1)) + (15 * (16^0))</p><p>= (15 *   16)   + (15 *  1)</p><p>=     240       +    15</p><p>=  255</p><p>The next higher number would be 256 [decimal],<br/>which divides evenly as the second power of 16,<br/>so we put a &quot;1&quot; in the third place followed by<br/>two zeros: 100 [hex] = 256 [decimal].   So,<br/>in hex, FF + 1 = 100.</p><p>There&apos;s an intermediate numbering system called octal,<br/>which is (you guessed it) base_8.  This system is a<br/>bit easier to understand because it works just like<br/>decimal but only has digits 0 thru 7.  After 7 comes<br/>10 [octal] = 8 [decimal].</p><p>In fact it&apos;s somewhat akin to our usual diatonic<br/>musical numbering system which uses A B C D E F G,<br/>then starts again at A when we reach the next &quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>Octal is not much used these days, hex being preferred.<br/>But because of the structure of the MIDI tuning data<br/>protocol, octal plays an important role in MIDI tuning<br/>calculations.</p><p>Now, with that out of the way, on to the specifics<br/>of the MIDI tuning data format.</p><p>From the official MIDI website<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.midi.org/about-midi/tuning.htm">http://www.midi.org/about-midi/tuning.htm</a>&gt;:</p><p>&gt; Frequency data shall be sent via system exclusive<br/>&gt; messages. Because system exclusive data bytes have<br/>&gt; their high bit set low, containing 7 bits of data,<br/>&gt; a 3-byte (21-bit) frequency data word is used for<br/>&gt; specifying a frequency with the suggested resolution.</p><p>In other words, the left-most bit or place, in each of<br/>the three 8-digit binary strings called a &quot;byte&quot; which<br/>belong to a tuning command, is set to 0, which in this<br/>case is simply a flag to let the hardware know that<br/>these 3 bytes of data are a SysEx type of message.</p><p>This is extremely important, because it means that the<br/>rules of enumeration which I elaborated above are not<br/>quite followed.  There&apos;s a different system in use here<br/>that&apos;s called an &quot;offset&quot;.</p><p>More from the midi website:</p><p>&gt; Frequency data shall be defined in units which are<br/>&gt; fractions of a semitone. The frequency range starts<br/>&gt; at MIDI note 0, C = 8.1758 Hz, and extends above<br/>&gt; MIDI note 127, G = 12543.875 Hz. The first byte of<br/>&gt; the frequency data word specifies the nearest<br/>&gt; equal-tempered semitone below the frequency. The next<br/>&gt; two bytes (14 bits) specify the fraction of 100 cents<br/>&gt; above the semitone at which the frequency lies.<br/>&gt; Effective resolution = 100 cents / 214 = .0061 cents.</p><p>There&apos;s a serious typo error on the webpage here, in the<br/>denominator of that fraction.  That effective resolution<br/>should be 100 cents / 2^14 = ~0.006103516 cent.</p><p>Thus, the greatest possible MIDI tuning resolution<br/>is equivalent to 1200 / (0.006103516) = 196608-EDO,<br/>or 2^14 = 16384 midipus per Semitone.</p><p>Let&apos;s begin by illustrating the nature of the MIDI data.<br/>I&apos;ll use variables s and m, to stand for Semitone bit<br/>and midipu bit, respectively:</p><p>0sssssss 0mmmmmmm 0mmmmmmm</p><p>So in other words, the highest value that any of these<br/>bytes can have is 1111111 [binary] = (2^8)-1 [decimal],<br/>which equals 127.  This is the same as saying:</p><p> (2^6)+(2^5)+(2^4)+(2^3)+(2^2)+(2^1)+(2^0)</p><p>= 64  + 32  + 16  +  8  +  4  +  2  +  1</p><p>= 127.</p><p>127 [decimal] = 7F [hex], because the first &quot;nibble&quot;<br/>is 0100 [binary] = 7 [hex], and the second &quot;nibble&quot;<br/>is 1111 [binary] = F [hex].  So all the values in<br/>the three MIDI data bytes must be between 0 and 127<br/>[decimal], which is the same as between 0 and 7F [hex].</p><p>The Semitone component<br/>------------------------</p><p>This is why there are 128 possible different MIDI notes,<br/>numbered from C0 to G10; or, to put it another way<br/>which relates to the illustration above, 128 different<br/>semitone divisions of the total pitch-space.<br/>In Semitones, this is:</p><p>  10 &quot;octaves&quot; + the highest &quot;octave&quot; of C + a &quot;5th&quot;</p><p>=  (12 * 10)   +           1               +    7</p><p>= 128 total MIDI-notes.</p><p>Let&apos;s examine some specific MIDI-note numbers to<br/>see how it works.</p><p>First let&apos;s try the familiar &quot;octave&quot;.  This is<br/>the 12th note above the starting note.

So if<br/>our first data byte (the one to the right) has a<br/>value of 7F [hex] = 127 [decimal], we can&apos;t simply use<br/>the regular 8F [hex] to reach 128 [decimal] .</p><p>We have to skip over the predetermined zero in the<br/>most significant bit of this byte, and put a &quot;1&quot;<br/>into the next available place, which would be the<br/>least significant bit of the next higher byte.</p><p>In binary notation, we may designate the mandatory<br/>zero in the highest bit with an &quot;x&quot;, to illustrate<br/>that it cannot be used in our calculation.</p><p>This ends up giving us a rather bizarre combination of<br/>octal and hex in our calculations, and has made MIDI<br/>tuning math more complicated than it probably needed to<br/>be.  I will refer to this as &quot;octal-hex&quot; in my labels.</p><p>We will also find that it is easier to understand the<br/>octal-hex combination if we divide the bytes into<br/>two nibbles for the purposes of binary notation, and<br/>if we use zeros as place-holders in the unused places<br/>of the octal-hex numbers and divide them into bytes.</p><p>Thus, in effect, the two pitch-bend data bytes are<br/>divided into 4 nibbles which are counted in the pattern:<br/>octal - hex - octal - hex (from left to right).</p><p>So if we start now at:</p><p>  127 [decimal]</p><p>= 00 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= x000 0000 x111 1111 [binary],</p><p>this gives a tuning inflection of ~0.775146484 cent.</p><p>The next number is:</p><p>128 [decimal]</p><p>= 01 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= x000 0001 x000 0000 [binary].</p><p>This gives a tuning inflection of 0.78125 cent.</p><p>So we can see that instead of representing 256 [decimal]<br/>as in a regular hex calculation, 01 00 [octal-hex] will now<br/>represent 128 instead.</p><p>So now we may cycle thru all the possible combinations<br/>of digits in the lower (right-most) byte until we<br/>fill all the places with their highest digit (which<br/>is &quot;1&quot; in binary), which would give us:</p><p>  x000 0001 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 01 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 128 + 127 [decimal]</p><p>= 255 [decimal].</p><p>This gives a tuning inflection of ~1.556396484 cents.</p><p>The next number is:</p><p>  256 [decimal]</p><p>= 02 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= x000 0010 x000 0000 [binary]</p><p>This gives a tuning inflection of 1.5625 cents.</p><p>So this rather complicated calculation is achieved<br/>by treating the left byte the same way as the right<br/>one, then multiplying it by 128, then adding both<br/>bytes together.</p><p>Alternatively, perhaps it is easier to think of<br/>each hex digit as a certain exponent of 2 which<br/>follows an alternating irregular pattern:</p><p>      4    3    4     ... pattern of exponent increase<br/>     / \  / \  / \<br/>= 2^11  2^7  2^4  2^0 ... exponent of 2</p><p>= 2048  128  16    1  ... decimal value</p><p>Since this interrupted pattern (i.e., the mandatory<br/>zero byte that doesn&apos;t count in the calculation) is a<br/>non-standard kind of math, let&apos;s cycle thru all the<br/>remaining pairs of numbers where the next &quot;place&quot;<br/>changes, to be absolutely clear on how it works.</p><p>= x000 0010 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 02 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 383 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: ~2.337646484 cents.</p><p>= x000 0011 x000 0000 [binary]</p><p>= 03 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= 384 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: 2.34375 cents.</p><p>= x000 0011 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 03 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 511 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: ~3.118896484 cents.</p><p>= x000 0100 x000 0000 [binary]</p><p>= 04 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= 512 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: 3.125 cents.</p><p>= x000 0111 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 07 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 1023 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: ~6.243896484 cents.</p><p>= x000 1000 x000 0000 [binary]</p><p>= 08 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= 1024 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: 6.25 cents.</p><p>= x000 1111 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 0F 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 2047 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: ~12.49389648 cents.</p><p>= x001 0100 x000 0000 [binary]</p><p>= 10 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= 2048 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: 12.5 cents.</p><p>= x001 1111 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 1F 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 4095 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: ~24.99389648 cents.</p><p>= x010 0000 x000 0000 [binary]</p><p>= 20 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= 4096 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: 25 cents.</p><p>= x011 1111 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 3F 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 8191 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: ~49.99389648 cents.</p><p>= x100 0000 x000 0000 [binary]</p><p>= 40 00 [octal-hex]</p><p>= 8192 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: 50 cents.</p><p>= x111 1111 x111 1111 [binary]</p><p>= 7F 7F [octal-hex]</p><p>= 16383 [decimal]</p><p>Tuning inflection: ~99.99389648 cents.</p><p>Whew!

That is, -720 TU must be distributed<br/>&gt; among the twelve fifths in a &quot;circle of fifths&quot; to remove<br/>&gt; the excess over seven octaves. (The ditonic comma is<br/>&gt; (3/2)^12 / 2^7; the logarithm of that amount is then for<br/>&gt; convenience called 720 Tuning Units.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this system, the other important comma (syntonic comma)<br/>&gt; works out to be almost exactly 660 TU, and the difference<br/>&gt; between the two commas (the &quot;schisma&quot;) is therefore 60.<br/>&gt; All three of the numbers 720, 660, and 60 are easily divisible<br/>&gt; by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12, the divisors used in describing<br/>&gt; most temperaments. Therefore, most temperaments can be<br/>&gt; described in TU&apos;s using only integer values, without use<br/>&gt; of a calculator.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=23535 href="#23535">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>5/22/2001 4:25:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the TU link, the page is improved now:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/measures.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/measures.html</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=23540 href="#23540">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>5/22/2001 7:32:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t understand the differences here between pitch-bend<br/>&gt;and MTS.  The MIDI Spec website simply shows the data<br/>&gt;format for specifying a pitch, and it looked to me like<br/>&gt;it could be referring to either method.  Please clarify.</p><p>No no, the MTS is an annex to the MIDI spec and has nothing<br/>to do with pitch bend messages. The message code and format<br/>is different. You should remove &quot;bend&quot; from your explanation<br/>of MTS. Take &quot;miditu&quot; instead of &quot;midipu&quot; if you really must<br/>use an acronym.<br/>The most important distinction between the messages is that<br/>the MTS uses absolute pitch values and pitch bend relative ones.<br/>Pitch bend specifies an increment or decrement from the key&apos;s<br/>tuning table pitch and is also relative to the range set with<br/>the RPN earlier mentioned.<br/>You have some more digging to do, but all can be found on the<br/>Internet. Study the pitch bend MIDI codes. Then if you<br/>understand everything, you could add explanation of the Yamaha XG<br/>and Roland GS tuning codes too, and make a nicely comprehensive<br/>webpage that will be useful to programmers.
