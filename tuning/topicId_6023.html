One issue I have<br/>with your results is the fact that you&apos;re associating some very complex<br/>ratios with intervals that are too far away to be heard as such. For<br/>example, the major sixth in 12-tET you call an 11-cent out-of-tune 22:13.<br/>But in most consonant contexts it will be heard as a 16-cent out-of-tune<br/>5:3. A general rule of thumb (Harry Partch&apos;s Observation One) is that the<br/>&quot;field of attraction&quot; (in cents) of a ratio is inversely proportional to the<br/>size of the numbers involved in the ratio. In this case, that would mean<br/>that if 16 cents mistuning renders a 5:3 unrecognizable, then 3.7 cents<br/>mistuning will render a 22:13 unrecognizable. I have studied the mathematics<br/>of ratio-series and find that Observation One comes out as a good<br/>approximation due to the greater density of competing ratios near, say,<br/>22:13, compared with those near 5:3. My work on harmonic entropy has allowed<br/>me to make these judgments more precise and determine, under a given<br/>assumption on the ear&apos;s tuning resolution (I usually use 1% based on various<br/>research), the probability of associating a particular ratio with a given<br/>interval.</p><p>So you might think you should just assign each interval its most likely<br/>ratio-interpretation by this measure, but there are pitfalls to doing that<br/>too. One of them is the &quot;consistency&quot; issue that I keep bringing up. Since<br/>you will most likely want to approximate not only JI dyads but chords as<br/>well, you must be sure that your approximations are consistent with one<br/>another. Although there aren&apos;t any examples of that with the ratios you&apos;ve<br/>suggested, try using similar methods to give JI approximations for ET triads<br/>and you&apos;ll start running into problems. The solution is to find the odd<br/>limit that each ET is consistent through (see my paper, Patrick Ozzard Low&apos;s<br/>paper, or Paul Hahn&apos;s web pages) and ignore ratios using odd numbers higher<br/>than the limit.</p><p>&gt;I know there is a<br/>&gt;128 cent gap each side of the unison.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p><p>I think it&apos;s most definitely a good thing. In this context, the only<br/>relevance of approximating JI is consonance, and only the simplest JI ratios<br/>are consonant. More complex ratios, though they may be built out of simple<br/>ratios, cannot be heard as such without the simple ratios actually present<br/>in the music, and in the ET context they won&apos;t be. So right on!</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I&apos;ve been seduced by Joe Monzo&apos;s incorrect definition of my own<br/>concept in his dictionary! In fact, the probabilities come from a simple<br/>model, essentially proposed by Van Eck. What harmonic entropy does is to<br/>take those probabilities and compute a dissonance measure from them.</p></div>
