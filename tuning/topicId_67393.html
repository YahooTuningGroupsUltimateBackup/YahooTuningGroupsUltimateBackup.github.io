We have<br/>to emphasize that the use of harmony as we know it was and is not<br/>musically practiced.<br/>Here is a crucial point. The Indian music is modal. There is a<br/>strong relationship to the tonic. When a third is played it always<br/>relate to the third degree as in Western harmonious tradition the<br/>third has a relative position, because it can be the root, the fifth<br/>or third of a chord.<br/>Eastern listeners often make remarks such as &quot;Beethoven symphonies<br/>are interesting, but why have all those chords been introduced,<br/>spoiling the charm of the melodies&quot;.<br/>The modal music of India is &apos;horizontal&apos; as the Western<br/>is &apos;vertical&apos;. The vertical, harmonious system, in which the group<br/>of related sounds is given at once, might be more direct though also<br/>less clear. The accurate discrimination of the different elements<br/>that constitute a chord is not usually possible.<br/>The modal, horizontal system, on the other hand, allows the exact<br/>perception and immediate classification of every note, and therefore<br/>permits a much more accurate, powerful and detailed outlining of<br/>what the music express.<br/>The 22 Shrutis (degrees)<br/>The modal music of India is &apos;horizontal&apos; as the Western<br/>is &apos;vertical&apos;. The vertical, harmonious system, in which the group<br/>of related sounds is given at once, might be more direct though also<br/>less clear. The accurate discrimination of the different elements<br/>that constitute a chord is not usually possible.<br/>The modal, horizontal system, on the other hand, allows the exact<br/>perception and immediate classification of every note, and therefore<br/>permits a much more accurate, powerful and detailed outlining of<br/>what the music express.<br/>Musical intervals can be defined in two ways, either by numbers<br/>(string lengths, frequencies) or by their psychological<br/>correspondences, such as feelings and images they necessarily evokes<br/>in our minds. There is no sound without a meaning, so the Indians<br/>consider the emotions that different intervals evoke as exact as<br/>sound ratios. The feeling of the shrutis depends exclusively on<br/>their position in relation to the tonic and indicate the key for the<br/>ragas.<br/>The 22 different keys or degrees encompass what the Indians consider<br/>the most common feelings and reflection of the human mind. They was<br/>aware of the division of the octave into 53 equal parts, the<br/>Pythagorean Comma, and its harmonic equivalent, the comma diesis,<br/>(the syntonic comma, the difference between the major and the minor<br/>tones).<br/>However, they choose the 22nd division of the octave based on the<br/>limit to differentiate the keys as well as psychological and meta<br/>physical reason. The symbolic correspondences of the number 22 and<br/>7, (7 strings and main notes), could also play a part since the<br/>relationship between the circle and the diameter is expressed as the<br/>approximate value of Pi, 22/7.<br/>The modal or Harmonic division of the octave<br/>Indian music is essentially modal, which means that the intervals on<br/>which the musical structure is built are calculated in relation to a<br/>permanent tonic. That does not mean that the relations between other<br/>than the tonic are not considered, but that each note will be<br/>established first according to its relation to the fixed tonic and<br/>not, as in the case of cycle of fifths by any permutations of the<br/>basic note.<br/>The modal structure can therefore be compare to the proportional<br/>division of the string (straight line) rather than to the periodic<br/>movement of the spiral of fifths.<br/>All the notes obtained in the harmonic system are distinct from<br/>those of the cyclic system, which is based on different data.

This cycle is very near to<br/>that of precession of the equinoxes, or the Pythagorean great year,<br/>which is of 25,920 solar years. Why the Chinese continued so many<br/>octaves in the cycle of fifths, could have something to do with<br/>their reference tone, Kung.<br/>In practice, for reasons that are symbolic as well as musical, after<br/>the 52nd fifth (53rd note) the Chinese follow the series only for<br/>the next seven degrees, which place themselves above those of the<br/>initial seven-note scale, and they stop the series at the 60th note.<br/>The reason given is that 12 (the number of each cycle) * 5 (the<br/>number of the elements) = 60.<br/>The scale of 60 L&uuml;<br/>The Chinese scale being invariable, constitute in effect a single<br/>mode. Every change in _expression will therefore depend upon<br/>modulation, a change of tonic.<br/>Firstly the choice of gender: fifths whose numbers in the series are<br/>even, are feminine. The odd numbered fifths are masculine.<br/>The choice of tonic are depended of complicated rules and rituals,<br/>which main purpose is to be in accordance with celestial as well as<br/>earthly influx or circumstances. Accordingly, the Chinese has to<br/>choose the right key for the hour of the day and the month. Even<br/>during a performance.<br/>It is a extensive scheme but to get an idea we can say that they<br/>corresponds to political matters, seasons, hour of the day,<br/>elements, color, geographic direction, planets and moon.<br/>This scale of fifths, perfect for transposition because of its<br/>extreme accuracy, also allows the study of astrological<br/>correspondences and of terrestrial influx in their Tone Zodiac.<br/>==========<br/>Thanks for any replies you are comfortable making!<br/>D</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2006 4:28:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello D,</p><p>&gt; An writer of alternative music related ideas recently expressed<br/>&gt; that  a 60 note scale could be both exponential and lograithmic<br/>&gt; in its structure and that it would have interesting properties.</p><p>Who was that?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve come across a lot of comments / info on microtuned scales.<br/>&gt; Many people discuss the 22, 60, 72 note scale (and higher), but I<br/>&gt; have yet to find ANY meaningful details on the 60, 72 note scale.<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich does a good job on the 22 note scale, Ive seen an<br/>&gt; interesting one based on pi and 22, and the Hindus have their<br/>&gt; version of this.
