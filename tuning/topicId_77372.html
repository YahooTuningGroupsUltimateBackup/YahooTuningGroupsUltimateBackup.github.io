Well, I just had to tell of it you guys.</p><p>I played bassoon in Bach&apos;s Magnificat in D major with an organ in a Long<br/>Island church, Oyster Bay.  Everything was a bit displaced.  The 3  trumpets in<br/>back were told by the conductor that they had to play ahead of the  beat, that<br/>the audience would hear them as late otherwise.  There was  plenty of sea<br/>sickness, moments of uncertainty in the time?, to go around.   But the conductor<br/>was good and sounded good.</p><p>The organ was in Kellner temperament.  Many remember Herr Kellner on  the<br/>list, and quite fondly.  Since we only had a single rehearsal on the  same day as<br/>the late afternoon concert, it was all I could do to get that out of  him.<br/>No numbers for anyone.  I knew it as quite close to Werckmeister  III.  Thing<br/>is, it was only when the organ played, that there would be a  move away from<br/>equal temperament.  The tuning swayed.  Must say, the 2  oboists were adroit at<br/>the flow, and we spoke about it.  I&apos;d hire  them.</p><p>Neil, you&apos;d have loved it!  Johnny</p><p>**************Gas prices getting you down?

The only diff is that he split the comma<br/>into five bits and put the extra tempered fifth on A-E.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div>
