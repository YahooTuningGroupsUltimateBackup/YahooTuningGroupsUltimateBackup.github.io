Am I missing anybody?</p><p>Oh, indeed, the history of microtonal music is fascinating,<br/>and *very* long. I have published webpages speculating that<br/>the Sumerians invented both &quot;pythagorean&quot; tuning and<br/>12-edo about 5000 years ago.</p><p>In more modern times in the West, 12-edo (in the form of 12-et)<br/>did become basically a universal standard for approximately<br/>the 2 centuries 1800-2000. The oldest Western score i know<br/>of which uses quarter-tones by Halevy in 1849 -- following<br/>is a quote from my very long webpages &quot;A Century of New Music<br/>in Vienna&quot;, which details a lot of the microtonal history in<br/>Europe during the time before 1920:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/v/vienna.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/v/vienna.aspx</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Also in Paris, 50-year-old Jacques Halevy becomes one<br/>&gt;&gt; of the earliest &quot;modern&quot; composers to use quarter-tones,<br/>&gt;&gt; in his incidental music to Prom&eacute;thee Enchain&eacute;<br/>&gt;&gt; [&apos;Prometheus bound&apos;]. Halevy&apos;s intention is to revive<br/>&gt;&gt; the ancient Greek &quot;enharmonic genus&quot;, using quarter-tones<br/>&gt;&gt; between B:C and E:F, following the Romanization of the<br/>&gt;&gt; note-names in the enharmonic version of the Greek<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Greater Perfect System&quot;.</p><p>There was much discussion in England during the mid-to-late<br/>1800s about various other tuning systems, particularly by<br/>Woolhouse:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/woolhouse/essay.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/woolhouse/essay.aspx</a></p><p>who recommended 50-edo as an ideal meantone temperament,<br/>and 19-edo as a more practical (but not as good otherwise)<br/>solution; and numerous essays by Bosanquet, who invented<br/>the generalized keyboard.</p><p>In America at this time, Henry Ward Poole patented a<br/>7-limit JI organ:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/poole/poole.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/poole/poole.aspx</a></p><p>Around this same time (late 1800s), the young Charles Ives<br/>was exposed to various experimental instruments designed<br/>by his father to make non-12-edo pitches. Ives had some<br/>ideas about &quot;stretched&quot; scales, which i wrote about here:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ives/ives-stretch.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ives/ives-stretch.aspx</a></p><p>You seem to know more about the microtonal movement in<br/>continental Europe during the early 1900s. I&apos;ve done a<br/>huge amount of research on this, and gave a presentation<br/>on it at Microfest 2001, &quot;Microtonality in Berlin and<br/>Vienna in the early 1900s&quot; -- the abstract which i quote<br/>below is here:</p><p><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/microfestabstracts.html#monzo">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/microfestabstracts.html#monzo</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Around the turn of the last century, there was a fair<br/>&gt;&gt; amount of experimentation and composition using microtonality,<br/>&gt;&gt; especially &quot;quarter-tones&quot;, in the Austrian and German<br/>&gt;&gt; capitals, Vienna and Berlin respectively, which were then<br/>&gt;&gt; (and still are) the largest musical centers in the<br/>&gt;&gt; German-speaking world. Examples from the latter half of<br/>&gt;&gt; the 1800s are Josef Petzval and Shohe Tanaka, and after<br/>&gt;&gt; 1900 Busoni, Schoenberg, and Webern all flirted with the<br/>&gt;&gt; idea of using microtones, and while none of them made<br/>&gt;&gt; real use of non-12-tET tunings, all three had significant<br/>&gt;&gt; influence on other composers. Richard H. Stein published<br/>&gt;&gt; a quarter-tone piece in 1906, and during the next decade<br/>&gt;&gt; Willi M&ouml;llendorf patented a quarter-tone keyboard which<br/>&gt;&gt; made a great impact on both Alois Haba and Ivan Wyschnegradsky,<br/>&gt;&gt; the two most significant European microtonalists of the<br/>&gt;&gt; earlier 20th century. There has been little written about<br/>&gt;&gt; this activity even in German, and almost nothing at all<br/>&gt;&gt; so far in English. There was much contact between many<br/>&gt;&gt; of these composers, and this lecture attempts to trace<br/>&gt;&gt; the lines of influence. I also speculate on the significance<br/>&gt;&gt; non-12-tET may have had for Mahler, since he was a strong<br/>&gt;&gt; supporter of Schoenberg and all of his larger works were<br/>&gt;&gt; written for the flexibly-tunable orchestra, and also on<br/>&gt;&gt; the relevance of microtonality to the development of both<br/>&gt;&gt; atonality and sprechstimme in Vienna at this time.</p><p>The early influences of Petzval and Tanaka should not be<br/>slighted: Petzval taught for decades at the University of<br/>Vienna and demonstrated 31-edo on his &quot;guitharp&quot;, and i<br/>suspect that Mahler witnessed this; and Bruckner got the<br/>opportunity to play Tanaka&apos;s 53-edo &quot;enharmonium&quot;, and<br/>he also taught at U of V. More of this is documented under<br/>the appropriate years in my &quot;Vienna&quot; page (under &quot;1877&quot; for<br/>Petzval, and &quot;1889&quot; and &quot;1891&quot; for Tanaka).</p><p>It is clear that Schoenberg grappled with the idea of<br/>microtonality for at least a few years. The opening<br/>page of his &quot;Sketchbook III&quot; contains, among sketches<br/>for the _Kammersymphonie_, an attempt at quarter-tone<br/>notation -- you can see the graphics under &quot;1906&quot; on my<br/>&quot;Vienna&quot; page.</p><p>A very important push in the direction of microtonality<br/>came from the publication in 1906 of Busoni&apos;s little<br/>book _Sketch of a new aesthetic of music_.  3 years later<br/>after Schoenberg met him, Busoni sent Schoenberg a copy<br/>of the book and they engaged in spirited correspondence<br/>for a few months. Schoenberg wrote a long letter to Busoni<br/>just before composing his amazing monodrama _Erwartung_,<br/>which contains this excerpt discussing his ultimate<br/>rejection of quarter-tones:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/schoenberg/to-busoni-1909-8-24.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/schoenberg/to-busoni-1909-8-24.htm</a></p><p>It&apos;s well-known that Berg and Webern (and particularly<br/>Webern) followed closely what their master Schoenberg<br/>taught them. There are sketches by Webern of two songs<br/>which contain microtones in the vocal part, dating<br/>probably from the first half of 1909 -- i made a<br/>webpage in English out of Domenic Schweiger&apos;s article<br/>on this:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/webern/micro/webern-micro.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/webern/micro/webern-micro.htm</a></p><p>I find it very interesting that Webern&apos;s use of a little<br/>cross for the microtonal notehead is exactly what Schoenberg<br/>used when he &quot;invented&quot; _sprechstimme_ two years later<br/>in his resumption of work on the _Gurrelieder_, and<br/>thereafter for the rest of his life.</p><p>In 1911, both Moellendorf and Jorg Mager built quarter-tone<br/>harmoniums. I have made a web version in German and English<br/>of Moellendorf&apos;s entire book from 1917:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/moellendorf/book/contents.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/moellendorf/book/contents.htm</a></p><p>(i also made a styrofoam model of one octave of Moellendorf&apos;s<br/>keyboard for my Microfest presentation.)</p><p>Finally, it was indeed Haba who was probably the most<br/>influential and significant of all the microtonal composers<br/>of this era. I have a webpage of his list of works, which<br/>uses different colors for his microtonal scores:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/haba/haba-worklist.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/haba/haba-worklist.aspx</a></p><p>(Note that not all of my Tonalsoft webpages have been<br/>converted to the Tonalsoft format yet, so some of these<br/>links will not have links back into the Encyclopedia.)</p><p>Partch developed his ideas on tuning in the 1920s, and<br/>they continued to evolve until publication of his book<br/>in 1947. Brian McLaren&apos;s version of that story can be<br/>found here:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/mclaren/partch/evolution.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/mclaren/partch/evolution.htm</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>M.

Hopefully folks will slog thru &quot;A Century<br/>&gt; of New Music in Vienna&quot;, where they can read about<br/>&gt; Helmholtz&apos;s book under &quot;1863&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Also, didn&apos;t Satie experiment with quarter tones?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He may have put some in his ballet scores, i don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m familiar with all of his piano music, of which<br/>&gt; there is a lot, and naturally that&apos;s all nominally 12-edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Upon Googling &quot;satie quartertones&quot;, i was led to this<br/>&gt; book, which turns out to have a lot of info pertinent<br/>&gt; to this thread, and a whole section on the Telharmonium:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://books.google.com/books">http://books.google.com/books</a>?<br/>&gt; id=RsvdGY9VFLUC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=satie+quartertones&amp;source=web&amp;ots<br/>&gt; =L8TXGO2bNh&amp;sig=cFJv_-sywZkhgoVXE0X17epQx8M<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>One of these days when I run out of other projects (I&apos;m now a Ruby<br/>language freak) I&apos;m going to try to put together a Telharmonium<br/>emulator. It actually looks like it could be done easily in CSound --<br/>they have the Hammond tone wheels in their libraries, so all that would<br/>be required is to generate the pitches. My recollection is that the<br/>Telharmonium did not have vibrato, which makes it even easier. I should<br/>dig up my book on the Telharmonium.</p><p>What&apos;s even more curious, though, is the fact that the Telharmonium<br/>existed at the same time as the beginnings of recording, yet apparently<br/>there were none made of it. Perhaps it had something to do with two<br/>irascible geniuses -- Cahill and Edison -- and their strong personalities.<br/>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br/>Version: GnuPG v1.4.7 (GNU/Linux)<br/>Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org">http://enigmail.mozdev.org</a></p><p>iD8DBQFG4mWD8fKMegVjSM8RAq+8AJ0bsE/YTVNFap++tIbQlV9ewaHN2gCgy9P7<br/>IF5JTBMmat/oYmkzC/yO2aY=<br/>=EAAU<br/>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</p></div><h3>Aaron K.
