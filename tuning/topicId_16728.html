And they needn&apos;t be that<br/>&gt;acurate regarding tuning etc [I&apos;ll work that out] what I&apos;m after is just<br/>&gt;plain old sheet music.</p><p>If you mean standard sheet music, you can get it from the Society.  Try<br/><a href="http://www.SPEBSQSA.org">www.SPEBSQSA.org</a>.  The best way to deal with them is to become a member,<br/>and if you like the music and want to play it on guitar, there&apos;s no<br/>better way than to turn out for your local chorus.  Singing is good for<br/>you, too!</p><p>BTW, don&apos;t feel you need to buy arrangements.  B-shop is very easy to<br/>arrange from a melody.  Anyone familar with the basics of voice leading<br/>can do it... just remember that the basic chords are tetrads instead<br/>of triads.  There are a couple of extra rules that you should be able<br/>to pick up, or I can send you a sheet on them (mail me off-list).</p><p>&gt;Why am I interested in this ? I plan to tune one of my interchangeable<br/>&gt;fretboards to some tuning based on babershop music [the other three are<br/>&gt;going to be fretted to a tuning Paul Erlich worked out for me and two<br/>&gt;others are to tunings by Erv Wilson + I will have a fretless board].</p><p>Hope you caught Paul&apos;s post on this...</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
