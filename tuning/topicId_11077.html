Since my lattice formula can already optionally<br/>&gt; include &apos;2&apos; as a factor, I am now able to lattice JI, meantones,</p><p>&gt; and ETs all on the same graph, which I think is a good thing.  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My ultimate objective is to be able to plot *any* and all types<br/>&gt; of tunings on the same lattice, so that any tuning may be seen<br/>&gt; as a subset of the total infinite set of pitches in a way which<br/>&gt; makes clear the rational underpinnings of the harmonic<br/>&gt; relationships.

The<br/>&gt; lattices that Paul Erlich was showing me had intervals of the<br/>&gt; same kind all going in the same direction as a straight line<br/>&gt; on the lattices -- the fifths of the limit 3 horizontally,<br/>&gt; the thirds of the limit 5 vertically, and the 7th limit going<br/>&gt; out from the page as the 3rd dimension, correct??  This<br/>&gt; pertained for BOTH the rectangualar AND triangular lattices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I notice that the Monzo lattices do not do this, but<br/>&gt; the 3 limit and 5 limit lines CROSS, and the 7 limit lines<br/>&gt; are tilted at only a slight angle from the 5 limit lines...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there some advantage to this type of plotting??  I certainly<br/>&gt; can see that some very beautiful lattices are made, but are the<br/>&gt; relationships as clear as in the &quot;traditional&quot; lattices??</p><p>None of the prime-axes in my lattices ever cross *in theory*.<br/>What you&apos;re probably seeing is the result of looking at the<br/>2-dimensional output of my n-dimensional lattices.</p><p>You can find the principles upon which I base my lattice formula<br/>in my article on lattices:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/lattices.htm</a></p><p>In brief: from a central reference point, which represents 1/1,<br/>each prime-axis radiates outward at an angle determined by the<br/>&apos;octave&apos;-reduced cents-value of the initial prime harmonic.</p><p>For example, the cents value of the 3rd harmonic is:</p><p>log(3) * (1200/log(2)) = ~1901.955 cents</p><p>To &apos;8ve&apos;-reduce it, we get:</p><p>~1901.955 mod 1200 = 701.955 cents</p><p>That figure should be readily recognized as the cents-value<br/>of the 3/2 &apos;perfect 5th&apos;.</p><p>Next we have to find the degree-value of the angle.  Since<br/>there are 360 degrees in a circle, and 1200 cents in the<br/>&apos;octave&apos; (which we can also think of as a circle), we multiply<br/>our cents-value by 360/1200 [= 3/10] to obtain the degrees.<br/>Thus, the angle for the 3-axis is:</p><p>~701.955 cents * (3/10) = ~210.6 degrees</p><p>So if we imagine a circle (which represents the &apos;8ve&apos;)<br/>around each lattice-point, with all prime-axes radiating<br/>outward from each lattice-point at a predetermined angle,<br/>and with some arbitrary point along those circles chosen<br/>to represent 0 = 1200 cents (I used to use 6 o&apos;clock, as in<br/>my Lattice article - now I use 12 o&apos;clock), the 3-axis will<br/>always extend at an angle of ~211 degrees from any lattice-point.</p><p>Similarly, the 5-axis will always extend at an angle of</p><p>  ( ( log(5) * (1200/log(2)) ) MOD 1200 ) * (3/10) degrees<br/>= (~2786.314 cents MOD 1200) * (3/10) degrees<br/>= (~386.314 cents) * (3/10) degrees<br/>= ~115.9 degrees</p><p>And so on.</p><p>The big advantage to using this formula is that one can<br/>represent *any* prime-factor with a *unique* angle, thus<br/>(in theory) plotting any ratio precisely onto a unique<br/>point according to its prime-factorization.  This (for me)<br/>is the whole point of using lattices: to illustrate the<br/>unique numerical qualities of each ratio and its unique<br/>relation to the rest of the pitches in the scale/lattice.</p><p>I say &apos;in theory&apos; because in practice, representing lattices<br/>of &gt;3 dimensions on a 2-dimensional surface, there will always<br/>be some type of overlapping.  But by using software to draw<br/>the lattices on a computer screen (which I&apos;m in the process<br/>of developing) one can zoom in to a magnification and/or<br/>rotate the diagram in 3-d space so that overlapping points<br/>or lines can be clearly separated.</p><p>Because we are limited to 3 dimensions (or 4, if we include<br/>time by the use of animation) in perceiving spatial relationships,<br/>there is no single way to represent &gt;3-D structures that is<br/>better than any other.</p><p>The method used by Paul and others (including me) to draw<br/>lattices here on this List is simply a bow to the limitations<br/>of ASCII representation.  The conventions used here, which<br/>you describe in the quote above, are the clearest way to<br/>represent a 2- or 3-D lattice in email.  For most *musical*<br/>purposes, this is sufficient, as the vast majority of rational-<br/>based music and music-theory is 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional<br/>(the best examples being Pythagorean, JI, and 7-limit,<br/>respectively).</p><p>But since I&apos;m interested in the history of tuning theory,<br/>I wanted to be able to view *any* rational tuning as a<br/>subset of the &apos;total lattice&apos;, thus the need for unique angles.<br/>If an ancient or Renaissance theorist used ratios with such<br/>factors as 19, 31, or 499, I need to be able to represent<br/>those uniquely.</p><p>For some criticism levelled against my lattice formula,<br/>primarly by Paul, see the List archives from about a year ago.<br/>His main complaint is that my lattice formula plots ratios<br/>in a way that seems to indicate a level of &apos;complexity&apos;<br/>that is the opposite of what is numerically and empirically<br/>true, so that, for instance, 15/8 and 6/5 are exactly the<br/>same distance from 1/1, when it seems that 6/5 should be<br/>much closer.</p><p>But for my purposes (so far), the advantages of my formula<br/>far outweigh these kinds of disadvantages.</p><p>--------</p><p>An extremely interesting footnote:</p><p>I&apos;ve been ransacking the libraries on information about the<br/>Sumerians lately, because I think I&apos;ve &apos;cracked the code&apos; for<br/>some Babylonian mathematical problems that mathematicians and<br/>Assyriologists have so far been unable to decipher, and which<br/>seem to me to be information handed down from the days of<br/>the Sumerian hegemony.</p><p>The problems make use of a &apos;coefficient&apos; called 18 <a href="http://IM.LA">IM.LA</a>.<br/>No one has been able to figure out what the Sumerian logogram<br/>&apos;<a href="http://IM.LA">IM.LA</a>&apos; refers to.</p><p>But the formulas always produce 2/3 (of a string-length, is my<br/>guess).  So the problems in question appear to me to be a formula<br/>for calculating the (so-called) Pythagorean scale, at *least*<br/>1000 years before Pythagoras, and perhaps another millenium<br/>or two before that, if the Sumerians had figured out the formula<br/>(as seems to be indicated by the Babylonian use of the Sumerian<br/>symbols in the formulae).</p><p>What I haven&apos;t been able to figure out is the role that the<br/>&apos;coefficient&apos; plays in the formula.</p><p>The Babylonians used a sexagesimal (= base-60) numbering<br/>system, so &apos;18&apos; really means 18/60 = 3/10.  AHA!</p><p>As one can see from my answer to Joseph above, the ratio of<br/>degrees to cents happens to provide exactly the same coefficient<br/>of 3/10.</p><p>So perhaps this formula actually concerns not a Pythagorean<br/>scale, but rather some type of cents-calculation?</p><p>Hmmmm..............<br/>Could temperament actually be a Babylonian (or Sumerian) invention,<br/>from c. 4000 years ago?....</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

To partially remedy these sorts of problems, I suggested to Monz<br/>that he map all the positive powers of primes to angles between 0<br/>degrees and 180 degrees, instead of between 0 degrees and 360<br/>degrees.<br/>This would also remedy another problem that Monz has previously<br/>acknowledged with his lattices, that there is no immediate way to<br/>distinguish whether a line at angle of x degrees is meant to<br/>represent<br/>a prime interval of about 10x/3 cents, or the inverse of a prime<br/>interval of about 10x/3 plus or minus 600 cents.</p><p>When I suggested this multi-purpose remedy to Monz, he said that<br/>someone else had suggested it to him right before me.
