It would not be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;difficult for me to include recognition within the program of special<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;sysex&apos;s (and/or meta-events in a .mid file) which instruct the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;program, on the fly, to behave in different ways.  Other commands<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;would release it to make decisions on its own, as it now does, again<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;on the fly.  In the short-term, existing sequencing programs could be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;used to apply these sysex&apos;s (and/or...); in the long term, a nicer<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;integration with other programs would be a lot more fun to use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Herman:]<br/>&gt; &gt;Another thing that might be helpful would be to use the key signature<br/>&gt; &gt;in the MIDI file to distinguish between sharps and flats. You could<br/>&gt; &gt;also use some of the unused MIDI controllers to set options. Either of<br/>&gt; &gt;these would be a lot easier than adding sysex messages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Funny, I&apos;d almost forgotten that the midi file has a place where the key<br/>&gt; signature can be specified.  Lessee, is that once at the beginning of<br/>&gt; the file, or any time via meta-events... [cue sound of books being<br/>&gt; opened]... AHA, it&apos;s a meta-event that can be inserted at any time!  And<br/>&gt; for pieces with more than 12 pitch classes, changing the key signature<br/>&gt; could clue the program which enharmonic was wanted.  Good idea!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unused controllers, huh...  Are you referring to the RPN and NRPN guys,<br/>&gt; or to plain ol&apos; Bx xx xx messages?  Are holes in the latter guaranteed<br/>&gt; to remain throughout time, I wonder?  Are they often overloaded by<br/>&gt; others?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t use commercial sequencing programs, so it&apos;s good to know what&apos;s<br/>&gt; easy and what&apos;s not.  Is it _quite_ hard to insert a sysex?  Or<br/>&gt; meta-event?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Bob Valentine responded:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [JdL:]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The thing I&apos;m right on the verge of doing is allowing more than 12<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;internal pitch classes (closely connected, of course, with recognition<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;of enharmonic spellings).  But I&apos;d like to introduce a set of commands<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;which composers could use to communicate to me: picking the tuning<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;file (5-lim, 7-lim, 11-lim, ...) and the key on the fly is my first<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;priority there.  In fact, that could probably be moved ahead of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;pitch class enhancement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I think the thing to come up with is how you want to communicate. I<br/>&gt; &gt;suggested a text file that could be synced internally with the midi<br/>&gt; &gt;file. You just need a way of specifying the parameter and specifying<br/>&gt; &gt;time. As has been pointed out, key signatures (to a certain extent)<br/>&gt; &gt;are communicable through midi. You&apos;ve suggested using sysex messages<br/>&gt; &gt;which your code would snarf. The problem I see with that is a friendly<br/>&gt; &gt;way to insert the sysex messages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Parallel text file - wow, my first reaction is that getting it in sync<br/>&gt; and keeping it that way might be difficult.  But then again, sequencing<br/>&gt; programs work with measure counts, right?  So maybe that&apos;d work well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You both hint that it&apos;s hard to insert sysex&apos;s via a sequencing program.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s too bad; don&apos;t really understand why, unless it&apos;s rarely done by<br/>&gt; most sequencers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [JdL:]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Before too long, I need to address the question of trying to attach to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;other programs.  The Monz&apos;s own JustMusic, under development, is tops<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;on my list, except that it&apos;s still in a highly unfinished state.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether I&apos;d have any leverage with, say, the Cakewalk people is an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;open question, but the request might best come from users of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;program who would like to attach to my program.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Bob:]<br/>&gt; &gt;Power Tracks Pro, a sequencer from the same people who do Band in a Box<br/>&gt; &gt;is not only dirt cheap but it has the capability to pass its data<br/>&gt; &gt;structures to external programs (either a dll or an exe). I did some<br/>&gt; &gt;experiments with this a few years ago and it worked fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kyool!!  Thanks for the tip!  Might go check&apos;m out.  I actually really<br/>&gt; _need_ a real sequencing program; my tools are primitive in the extreme<br/>&gt; (you might call them assembly language sequencing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;If you are interested in plugging in, then I&apos;m interested in knowing<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;what features are most important to you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m really not sure. Maybe I&apos;ll have a better idea if I get some 12tet<br/>&gt; &gt;retuned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meaning some of your own works, I hope!
