This is an incredible<br/>book -- it&apos;s new, original, rigourous and readable.  I found it similar to<br/>Formalized Music and Genesis of a Music (which are both in Bristol<br/>library) in that rather than being dull theory, it connects directly with<br/>the creative process.  But especially in this case, the great music it&apos;s<br/>describing hasn&apos;t been written yet -- the examples are alluring, but<br/>there&apos;s a lot more work to be done in the field.  A field which barely<br/>existed before.</p><p>As if that wasn&apos;t enough:</p><p>  The author is on the List -- Hi Bill!</p><p>  The List gets plugged in the book!!!</p><p>Is this the Central Library in Edinburgh you&apos;re talking about?  You should<br/>already have it, but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if you didn&apos;t.  It was<br/>declared unobtainable on an interlibrary loan from Keynsham, which<br/>probably means there isn&apos;t a copy in the whole of South-West England.<br/>Ironically, the copy I bought from <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> was printed in Britain, but<br/>I&apos;ve never seen it in a library or bookshop over here.</p><p>Published by Springer, you can get the details easily enough, but if not I<br/>can supply them.</p><p>Check that you have Partch&apos;s Genesis.., and Helmholtz&apos;s Sensations... .<br/>You probably do.</p><p>Matthieu&apos;s &quot;Harmonic Experience&quot; is also good, even though it ends up as<br/>12-equal propoganda.  It should be more useful for the general reader than<br/>Sethares, but also less respectable to academics of whatever kind.  You&apos;re<br/>supposed to do the exercises as you go along, so I haven&apos;t got very far.<br/>This book was declared unobtainable by both Keynsham and Clevedon.</p><p>John Chalmers has a book out, but we&apos;ve e-mailed each other far too often<br/>for me to offer an unbiased opinion of it.  One thing I will say, however,<br/>is that the quality if the glue holding it together is very poor, so it<br/>could fall apart quickly in a library.</p><p>&gt; Thank you in advance for any efforts you might make to assist me.</p><p>People have been saying such nice things about my software, I thought I&apos;d<br/>pass the favour along.</p></div><h3><a id=13786 href="#13786">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2000 8:01:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I would be extremely grateful if any of you can take the time to post<br/>&gt;your top ten (or thereabouts) CDs and top ten books and/or scores with<br/>&gt;references if possible.

It lives at <a href="http://www.lumma.org/">http://www.lumma.org/</a>, and gets updated every<br/>time I get a new recording.  Right now, both Blackwood and Haverstick are<br/>represented. I&apos;m always open to suggestions; if you know of any good<br/>recordings I missed, I&apos;d be happy to review them.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
