Also, are there books that you would recommend reading<br/>before diving into Partch&apos;s?</p><p>A little personal background follows:</p><p>&#x9;Nearly four years ago, I had my first exposure to Just Intonation when I<br/>attended the SCI National conference held at the University of Iowa.  Ben<br/>Johnston was the guest composer and his _Sleep and Waking_ (for american<br/>gamelan) was performed on one of the concerts.  Johnston also gave a very<br/>interesting master class on the american gamelan with its (co?)creator Ron<br/>George.  Tuning was discussed only very briefly and only with regard to<br/>that composition.  He did use the Partch terms U-tonality and O-tonality,<br/>whose meanings I surmised as Undertone-derived and Overtone-derived<br/>(through my reading of Hindemith&apos;s _Craft of Music Composition_, in which<br/>he mentions the theoretical existence of an &quot;undertone series&quot;).  While I<br/>haven&apos;t read enough of _Genesis_ yet, I&apos;m sure that they were very<br/>inaccurate definitions.<br/>&#x9;Later, as a graduate student in composition at the University of Iowa, I<br/>did research on Johnston, his music, and his theories for a composition<br/>seminar--my head was spinning from the theory, and spinning even faster<br/>(maybe at a 9/7 rate) at the music.  At this point I began my own<br/>experiments with different tuning systems in the electronic studios,<br/>utilizing a Kyma system mostly for building various ETs and imposing<br/>pre-built tunings like Werkmeister3 on MIDI files of Bach&apos;s WTC to see the<br/>effects of the tuning on the modulatory sections--in particular to<br/>highlight the less-stable sound of the dominant in tunings other than<br/>12tET.<br/>&#x9;I have created only one composition that utilizes a tuning other than<br/>12tET.  It is a stochastic piece realized with a combination of Cmask,<br/>Csound, and Cool Edit Pro, where a varying vertical distance is divided<br/>into 13tET (the space could be 100-1000Hz, or 580-900Hz, etc.).  The sound<br/>source is a simple sine-wave.  A number of &quot;panels&quot; and &quot;panelettes&quot; were<br/>generated in Csound and then chorussed and reverberated in Cool Edit Pro,<br/>where they were also mixed down to the final piece.  The effect is that of<br/>Ligeti&apos;s _Volumina_, but for a fairly mellow, spacey,<br/>conceived-of-yet-not-built organ.</p><p>Whew! If you made it this far, I appreciate your interest in my background<br/>and I look forward to being able to contribute to this list after I get a<br/>better grasp on the theory.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jon Southwood<br/><a href="mailto:noj@cedar-rapids.net">noj@cedar-rapids.net</a></p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/1999 4:33:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Southwood wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Jon Southwood&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:noj@cedar-rapids.net">noj@cedar-rapids.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, are there books that you would recommend reading<br/>&gt; before diving into Partch&apos;s?</p><p>David Doty&apos;s Just Intonation Primer.</p><p>&gt; (maybe at a 9/7 rate) at the music.
