There are attractors<br/>that are &quot;close to&quot; their embedded period one orbits in the sense that the<br/>chaos is a chaotic variation around the period one. The usual method of<br/>chaos control requires only small perturbations of some parameter (chord<br/>tightness?) to switch between the embedded periodic orbits. Of course this<br/>is just speculation, but the fact that at least one study has found<br/>a strange attractor in a human vowel vocalization, and the fact that<br/>controlling chaos is quite easy leads me to wonder about the possibility.</p><p>As to Neil&apos;s post about snotty microtonaliusts, perhaps the fellow he<br/>talked to is just a very sensitive person and was unduly bummed.</p></div>
