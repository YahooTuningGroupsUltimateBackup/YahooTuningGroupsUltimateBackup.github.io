That makes this a rational scale, and its<br/>notes are said to be in Just (ie exact) Intonation.</p><p>That&apos;s all there is to being JI.</p><p>And that&apos;s the easy question answered .... !</p><p>Here&apos;s the easiest part of the other answers: this scale also<br/>&quot;exhibits tetrachordal similarity&quot;.  That means it consists of<br/>two tetrachords - sequences of four notes - joined together,<br/>and that the upper tetrachord and the lower one both have<br/>the same interval structure (ratios between notes) internally.</p><p>In my example scale of A major, the lower tetrachord is<br/>A B C# D, with interval ratios 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3.  The upper is<br/>E F# G# A&apos;, with interval ratios 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1.  If you<br/>divide the ratios for the upper tetrachord by that for its<br/>lowest note E, you get: 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 --- exactly the same as<br/>for the lower tetrachord.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----</p><p>Dear all,</p><p>I was wondering what makes a sequence of notes a (just intonation)<br/>scale.

That is, scales built up<br/>from two distinct intervals.  Just intonation scales usually contain<br/>more than two dimensions.  The simplest example of two-dimensional JI<br/>is Pythagorean intonation, but this is rarely described as &quot;JI&quot;.

A less rigorous method would be to look<br/>for step sizes in the JI scale that are almost the same, and consider<br/>them to be equivalent.  Continue until you have two step sizes and<br/>then see if the result is MOS/DE.

It&apos;s usually taught that the scale has two<br/>distinct forms, one ascending and the other descending.  For<br/>example, the C minor scale runs thus -</p><p>Ascending: C D Eb F G A B C&apos;<br/>Descending: C&apos; Bb Ab G F Eb D C</p><p>- and it&apos;s in _both_ those forms that countless music students<br/>for centuries have practiced it.</p><p>But of course, you knew that!  Just thought I&apos;d remind you :-)</p><p>.....</p><p>From the point of view of _tuning_ the scale, what matters are<br/>the pitches of the notes that comprise it, and their (intervallic)<br/>relationship.  The order is a secondary consideration.  The set<br/>of notes in any scale, I prefer to call the gamut.  In the case of<br/>C minor, we have more than the usual 7 pitches per octave; 9 in<br/>fact.  It is an abstraction from the scale.  Until historically recent<br/>advances in technology (logarithms, calculators and computers)<br/>simplified calculation, scales have usually arisen from _melodic<br/>practice_, rather than from theoretical harmonic ideas.</p><p>Which is not to say that building scales based purely on theoretical<br/>reasons is wrong!; merely that you won&apos;t know what kind of music<br/>you can make with them until you hear them in practice.  But no<br/>matter what its genesis, any scale is just another musical resource.<br/>Human hearing is the essential medium through which those<br/>resources must pass, and individual taste is the final arbiter of<br/>which resources are useful.</p><p>To me, a scale is at least two sequences of notes - one ascending,<br/>another descending - drawn from a gamut, which is a set of notes.</p><p>(I say &quot;at least&quot;, since in my experience, some Indian singers use<br/>more than one alteration (like that of A Ab in C minor) of a single<br/>scale degree, depending on the particular ornament they&apos;re using<br/>at the time.  I believe that classically-trained Western violinists<br/>do something similar; whether deliberately or not, I couldn&apos;t say.)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 266.11.13 - Release Date: 19/5/05</p></div><h3><a id=58642 href="#58642">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/21/2005 6:55:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/21/2005 8:32:06 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:yahya@melbpc.org.au">yahya@melbpc.org.au</a> writes:<br/>don&apos;t think Kraig said, or even implied, that a JI scale is &quot;anathema to<br/>melody&quot;.<br/>He may think so, so I&apos;ll let him speak for himself.

I can&apos;t think of anything that I regard as more<br/>quintessentially melodic than the movement from one note to another a<br/>pure JI interval, a simple ratio, away.<br/>Before we rest the matter as pure opinion, please allow me to elaboraate.  In<br/>my experience as a composer using many different systems of and approaches to<br/>tuning, certain intervals demonstrate greater melodic pull than others.  For<br/>example, quartertones make for great melodic tension, as does the leading tone<br/>of Romantic style music.</p><p>In contradistinction, just intervals -- as beautiful as you may describe<br/>their ascent or descent to another -- by their very nature melt away immediately<br/>into harmony.  This is especially so through the 7th limit.  The mere movement<br/>of a melodic JI interval to another is overshadowed by their role in a<br/>harmonic connection.  As a matter of priority of function, JI is weak in melodic<br/>tension.  13 and 11 limit interval make a huge difference.</p><p>I guess it comes down to a matter of musical style and taste.

Partch is a good example who used the diamond as a harmonic structure but filled it out to make a 43 tone scale<br/>Erv Wilson who discovered the hexany would likewise not see the hexany as a scale, but would add tones to make who would be some type of melodic integrity<br/>And there are plenty of scales that are not limited to limits, some very ancient like some of Ptolemy, or any of the scales i use, which are just intonation by definition but have nothing to do with limits.<br/>Moments of symmetries only exist in the case of the pythagorean. while there are many constant structures, and these contain many subsets that most would hear as a scale , but do not satisfy being distributed evenly.<br/>There are scales that don&apos;t fit into constant structures either such as the enharmonic scales like many tetrachordal scales.<br/>Compositionally i have used what to my ear sounds like a scale by might only span a fifth or a tritone. such compressed scales are common in north africa.<br/>So the more we tried and pin it down, the more it evades us. i am sure that others will come up with other ways of generating scales or might find a property that includes all the above<br/>If we play aa series of ratios and we have no desire to add any pitches to the spectrum, or feel a gap we would like to fill then this is probably a scale.<br/>There is also the case of where we use not all the notes of a scale per se, and here i guess the guide would be that if we added particular notes and we felt it did not change the spectrum or melodic field then we might consider these a part of the scale.<br/>One cannot define scale without a certain amount of subjectivity.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=58645 href="#58645">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2005 8:56:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; I tried to fix that once by defining &quot;scale&quot; so that the notes were<br/>logarithmically discrete, but people were not happy. I suspect most<br/>people would prefer that it not be given a strict mathematical<br/>definition, which of course would also require stating whether it was<br/>a set, and if so, a set of what.</p><p>Well I&apos;m game to suggest a definition of scale, as a point<br/>for discussion, mainly to show up the difficulties.</p><p>How about - a scale is an infinite countable unordered<br/>subset of the positive reals which must have 1 as a member.</p><p>Then if someone says that scales are usually finite<br/>- well that is because you usually give them an<br/>interval of repetition. So what you have there<br/>isn&apos;t a scale as such, but a scale generator.</p><p>A bit like saying<br/>Here are the natural numbers:</p><p>1, 2, 3, 4, ...</p><p>But you  haven&apos;t written them all down of course.</p><p>Here is a scale</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 ...</p><p>It&apos;s just that normally we leave out the<br/>... as &quot;understood&quot;. There the method we<br/>are using to generate the scale uses<br/>a particular ordering, and of course<br/>has to because that&apos;s how it works.</p><p>However, the scale we<br/>are using it to generate doesn&apos;t have<br/>to be thought of as ordered in that<br/>way - the same scale can be<br/>ordered in whatever way we please.</p><p>So</p><p>1/1 4/3 3/2 9/8 5/4 5/3 15/8 2/1 ...<br/>would also generate the same scale<br/>and if anyone wants to use that ordering<br/>or whatever ordering they please, then fine.</p><p>That then avoids the problem of getting into such<br/>things as intervals of equivalence and the question<br/>of how to treat non octave scales, or all<br/>the different types of scales there could be<br/>- any kind of scale is allowed by this definition<br/>and you don&apos;t need to enumerate them in advance.<br/>It means someone can come up with some completely<br/>new kind of scale construction idea and so long as<br/>it generates countably many positive numbers<br/>then it is included in our mathematical definition<br/>so we won&apos;t need to keep updating our definition<br/>to take account of new scale construction ideas.</p><p>It does have a bit of a drawback though because<br/>you might want to allow a range of values<br/>for an element in a scale.</p><p>More generally, maybe a scale should be<br/>regarded as a set of line segments rather<br/>than a set of points. Normally each line<br/>segment is of zero length so you lose nothing<br/>by treating them as points. But they can<br/>be of non zero length corresponding to a range of values. Someone might want to go<br/>further and say that each line segment<br/>should also have a weighting attached to<br/>it so that e.g. the line segment around<br/>3/2 might have 3/2 itself as the most<br/>3/2 like interval, and then tail off<br/>quite rapidly to either side so that<br/>say 50 cents flat or sharp is very low<br/>probability or zero probability 3/2<br/>(in some particular context).</p><p>But the one around 5/4 might have<br/>a more slowly tapered weighting so that<br/>even an 11/9 or 14/11 is within the range of possible 5/4s.</p><p>What is your idea about defining a scale<br/>so that its notes are logarithmically<br/>discrete?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=58646 href="#58646">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2005 8:57:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Yahya</p><p>&gt; Could you please give an example of the sort of<br/>doubly infinite scale you had in mind?

He may think so, so I&apos;ll let him speak for himself.  But it&apos;s<br/>fairly clear that you think it is.</p><p>[JR]  Hi Yahya,</p><p>Kraig said: &quot;Scales are concerned with melodic qualites of a series of notes<br/>( as opposed to harmonic ).:</p><p>I read into this that if &quot;scales are concerned with melodic qualities&quot;<br/>basically, then just intonation is a poor representative as a scale in this<br/>regard.</p><p>[YA]  Yes, I thought this was your interpretation, but didn&apos;t interpret<br/>Kraig&apos;s words that way myself.</p><p>[YA, earlier]  Respectfully, I disagree.  I can&apos;t think of anything that<br/>I regard as more quintessentially melodic than the movement from one<br/>note to another a pure JI interval, a simple ratio, away.</p><p>[JR]  Before we rest the matter as pure opinion, please allow me to<br/>elaborate.  In my experience as a composer using many different<br/>systems of and approaches to tuning, certain intervals demonstrate<br/>greater melodic pull than others.</p><p>[YA]  Yes, I did think this might have been your meaning.  Thank you for<br/>clarifying that.  I agree with you, based on my own experience as a<br/>vocalist, player, listener and composer.  Also, I think that the force<br/>tending to move a particular note to another one (melodic pull) is<br/>greater when the gamut in use provides notes closer to the first.<br/>This is something you can see quite clearly by choosing simpler or<br/>more complex scales, even in 12-EDO or JI.</p><p>[JR]  For example, quartertones make for great melodic tension, as does<br/>the leading tone of Romantic style music.</p><p>In contradistinction, just intervals -- as beautiful as you may describe<br/>their ascent or descent to another -- by their very nature melt away<br/>immediately into harmony.  This is especially so through the 7th limit.<br/>The mere movement of a melodic JI interval to another is overshadowed<br/>by their role in a harmonic connection.  As a matter of priority of<br/>function, JI is weak in melodic tension.  13 and 11 limit interval make a<br/>huge difference.</p><p>[YA]  I see what you&apos;re saying, but for me  - most particularly in<br/>the music I write - the harmonic context is usually the result of<br/>melodic movements, rarely the reverse.  The &quot;mere movement&quot;<br/>between JI notes melodically is my primary resource; from it I<br/>build figures (motives, themes) and it&apos;s the interplay of these<br/>figures that creates the music.  So - in the context of my own<br/>music at least - I can&apos;t agree that &quot;just intervals ... by their very<br/>nature melt away immediately into harmony.&quot; I suggest that when<br/>they do, it&apos;s a result of musical style, rather than of harmonic<br/>nature.</p><p>[YA, earlier]  I guess it comes down to a matter of musical style<br/>and taste.  In a contest of taste, there are no winners! :-)</p><p>[JR]  Or it may be based on a wider sampling of what kinds of<br/>intervals are available for musical use.  Melodic tunings of a<br/>menagerie of variations exist around the world, some making<br/>no JI sense.  And yet they work fantastically for their musical<br/>purpose.</p><p>[YA]  Very true.</p><p>[JR]  Of course there is not contest.

One could take that as ones<br/>&quot;scale&quot; at least, as a gamut if one needs one that can<br/>be ordered one dimensionally (or as mathematicians say,<br/>&quot;linearly ordered&quot;).</p><p>Robert<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 266.11.15 - Release Date: 22/5/05</p></div><h3><a id=58675 href="#58675">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2005 8:57:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>More cultures use just intonation melodically than harmonically. , India and the mid east.

If I may be allowed to rephrase, a gamut is an ascending-descending order of dynamic notes, each sounded one after the other, as compared to a scale which is merely a static set of tones (confined in a period) from low to high. So, the &grave;melodic minor&grave; is a gamut made up of 9 distinct pitches, whose scale has the 6th and 7th degrees alterated by a half-tone upon descent.</p><p>And a minor key would have all instances of harmonic, melodic and natural minors within it. I am hereby inclined to say that maqams (and maybe rags and destgahs too) are actually keys per se.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  From: Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 23 May&imath;s 2005 Pazartesi 7:37<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: question about just intonation scales</p><p>  Johnny,</p><p>  I agree that the melodic minor scale uses a 9-note gamut.  Its<br/>  ascending and descending forms draw different notes from<br/>  this gamut.  The harmonic minor scale, however, uses only a<br/>  7-note gamut.  Its ascending and descending forms use the<br/>  exact same notes.</p><p>  Another way of looking at these scales is to say that each<br/>  contains 7 scale degrees, some of which - the sixth and<br/>  seventh - have alternate forms which we need to use to suit<br/>  a particular melodic (or harmonic?) context.</p><p>  I guess that one reason I think of scales as being ordered<br/>  is from long-term interest in classical Indian music, in which<br/>  the raga is more than a scale, it is a pattern of melodic<br/>  movement, more closely allied to Western ideas of theme<br/>  or motif.</p><p>  I think it perfectly natural that you do remember and &quot;file<br/>  away&quot; the rising and falling intervals as different, since the<br/>  two directions of motion can have vastly different emotional<br/>  effects.  For example, the rising fifth that opens &quot;The Star<br/>  Wars Theme&quot; is very different in effect from the falling fifth<br/>  that begins &quot;The Wild Colonial Boy&quot;.</p><p>  Regards,<br/>  Yahya</p><p>  -----Original Message-----<br/>  [YA]<br/>  To me, a scale is at least two sequences of notes - one ascending,<br/>  another descending - drawn from a gamut, which is a set of notes.</p><p>  [JR]<br/>  I have always taught haromnic minor as a 9 note scale, rather than<br/>  two different scales based on direction.  When analyzing Bach for<br/>  chord content, it seemed the more coherent manner.  On the other<br/>  hand, I find it amazing that I name and file away musical intervals<br/>  differently when they are ascending than when they are descending.</p><p>  For example, an ascending perfect fourth is &quot;Here Comes the Bride,&quot;<br/>  while a descending perfect fourth is reached directly by the opening<br/>  interval of Schubert&apos;s &quot;Unfinished Symphony.&quot;</p><p>  all best, Johnny</p><p>  --<br/>  No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>  Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>  Version: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 266.11.15 - Release Date: 22/5/05</p><p>  You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>  of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  Yahoo!
