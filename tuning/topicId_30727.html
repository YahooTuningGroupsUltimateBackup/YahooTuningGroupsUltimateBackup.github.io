Do wide<br/>range of file types.</p><p>For mid, html, images, text straightforward, for .exe, and .mp3s<br/>(which they do) their redirection download doesn&apos;t work<br/>for everyone.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/birdsong.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/birdsong.htm</a></p><p>Very fast connection to the internet. Do images, html, txt<br/>midi. Don&apos;t do zips or .exe, also don&apos;t do some less well<br/>known file types - they didn&apos;t do nwc files which is why<br/>I stopped using them (but come to think of it now, I didn&apos;t think<br/>to ask if they could add them to their list of supported<br/>files).</p><p>Great site if the file types one wants are supported. Has<br/>flashing ads sometimes, but can scroll them out of view.</p><p>I&apos;ve also got a number of sites with no ads at all,<br/>but can no longer upload files to them or change<br/>the content, though they continue to host my sites.</p><p>There used to be many ad free sites, just a couple of<br/>years ago.</p><p>Amount advertisers pay for a site to host their ads has<br/>recently gone down suddenly by a factor of ten or so,<br/>which is prob. why a lot of sites now have more obtrusive<br/>ads.</p><p>For mp3s, I&apos;ve been trying out <a href="http://mp3.com.au">mp3.com.au</a> as an alternative<br/>to <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a><br/><a href="http://mp3.com.au/RobertWalker">http://mp3.com.au/RobertWalker</a><br/>They add your file to the site within 72 hours, in practice usually<br/>by the next day, so faster than <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>, and your listeners<br/>don&apos;t have to join to listen, also have 28k streaming which<br/>is useful if one has a slow connection.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
