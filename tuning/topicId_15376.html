In the M6-8 expansion, one voice would move<br/>by the usual 9:8 whole-tone which Marchettus describes in accord with<br/>standard Pythagorean tuning, the other by a semitone or &quot;diesis&quot; of<br/>28:27.</p><p>Anyway, whether or not it has any relevance to Marchettus, the idea of<br/>12:7 as the arithematic mean of 3:2 and 2:1 is a neat relationship I<br/>hadn&apos;t considered.</p><p>Again, please let me wish you the best during your time away from the<br/>list.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2000 10:30:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
