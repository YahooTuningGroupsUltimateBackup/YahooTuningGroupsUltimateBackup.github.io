All of the messages were repeated on Feb. 1.  I wonder how many of you have had the problems and have not mentioned it on the list?   Also I wonder is a problem more on PC computers or on Macs?  My computer is a PC.  I subscribe to other egroups (yahoogroups) and one of them as had the same problems as the the tuning, one seems OK and the others have been silent for several days.

Alita Morrison</p><p>I think the blank messages are from one that I sent through the<br/>website.  I sent other ones the same way, but only this one screwed<br/>up.  It did eventually got through to my e-mail account, but with the<br/>wrong subject line.  It may be something to do with the move from<br/>eGroups to Yahoo, I expect they&apos;ll sort it out.</p><p>Occasionally repeated messages do come through.  Although I didn&apos;t<br/>notice any yesterday, perhaps it happened after I went to bed.</p><p>It shouldn&apos;t depend on PC/Mac/whatever.  The way that garbled message<br/>of mine came through may depend on your e-mail software.</p><p>A more worrying aspect of the change is that, according to the<br/>agreement I saw yesterday, Yahoo claim to own rights to all the<br/>content that we post.  It looks like the same as the Geocities<br/>license.</p><p>Here&apos;s a quote:</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>(c) With respect to all other Content you elect to post to other<br/>publicly accessible areas of the Service, you grant Yahoo! the<br/>royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully<br/>sub-licensable right and licence to use, reproduce, modify, adapt,<br/>publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform<br/>and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to<br/>incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now<br/>known or later developed.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>It may be the list itself is the &quot;other Content&quot; they can&apos;t do this<br/>with.  It&apos;s not actually clear.  But you should at least be careful of<br/>placing original music in the &quot;Files&quot; area.</p><p>          Graham</p></div>
