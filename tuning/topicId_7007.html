I&apos;m going to<br/> have to add something at the beginning laying that all out.</p><p> Here&apos;s a brief tutorial (perhaps when I&apos;ll just paste this<br/> into my paper):</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p> First of all, the basis for Greek scale construction was<br/> the _tetrachord_ (= &apos;4 strings&apos;).  Their theory (at<br/> least Aristoxenus and after) was based on the lyre, and<br/> not on any wind instruments.</p><p> (Aristoxenus criticizes those who base their theory on the<br/> _aulos_, which was a sort of oboe.  Kathleen Schlesinger wrote<br/> a book, _The Greek Aulos_, which Partch admired, but which has<br/> since been discredited, where she reconstructs ancient scales<br/> based on measurements of holes in surviving ancient auloi.)</p><p> (Note: Kraig Grady has already registered dissent against<br/> the arguments discrediting Schlesinger; the fact is that<br/> *much* more research needs to be done on the question of<br/> what scales the ancient _auloi_ actually produced.)</p><p> So the tetrachord designates 4 notes, two of which are fixed<br/> and two are moveable.</p><p> The fixed notes are those bounding the tetrachord, which<br/> are always assumed to be a 3:4 interval.  It&apos;s the position<br/> of the two moveable notes that was argued about so much,<br/> and which makes this stuff so interesting to tuning theorists.</p><p> (BTW, John Chalmers&apos;s book _Divisions of the Tetrachord_ is<br/> entirely about specifically this.)</p><p> Those various divisions are what determine the different<br/> _genera_ (plural of _genus_ - the actual Greek word<br/> is _genos_, but commentators writing in English generally<br/> use the Latin form).  There were 3 basic genera:<br/> Diatonic (= &apos;thru tones&apos;), Chromatic (= &apos;colored&apos; or<br/> &apos;thru the shades&apos;), and Enharmonic (= &apos;properly attuned&apos;).</p><p> Apparently the Enharmonic derived from the ancient scales<br/> which were called _harmonia_, thus its name.  That was<br/> the one with &apos;quarter-tones&apos;.  The chromatic had a pattern<br/> that more-or-less involved a succession of 2 semitones,<br/> and the Diatonic is the one we&apos;re most familiar with,<br/> using mainly &apos;whole tones&apos; with a few semitones.</p><p> Aristoxenus said that there were also many different &apos;shades&apos;<br/> or &apos;colors&apos; of all three genera, using different interval<br/> sizes, but that the genus was specified according to some<br/> vague overall &apos;feeling&apos; about how it sounded.  He specified<br/> the measurements for 2 shades of Diatonic and 3 shades of<br/> Chromatic, but while he described other shades of Enharmonic,<br/> he gave measurements for only one.</p><p> The main thing to remember is that the names of the Greek<br/> notes are based on their position within the tetrachord,<br/> and that since two of the notes are moveable, it&apos;s really<br/> better to *THINK* in the Greek way rather than try to<br/> represent this stuff in our modern scale/note terms.</p><p> But that said, the easiest way for you to begin understanding<br/> it is to outline the Diatonic using our letter-name notes.</p><p> The reference pitch in Greek theory was called _mese_<br/> (= &apos;middle&apos;), which we can call &apos;A&apos;.  The names of the<br/> strings (= notes) came from their position on the lyre.</p><p> A confusing point: the names designated the string&apos;s<br/> distance from the player, NOT its pitch; similar to<br/> a guitar, where the string lowest in pitch (low E) is<br/> the one at the top of the set of six strings, and also<br/> the nearest to the player.</p><p> The Diatonic genus &apos;octave&apos; scale would be:</p><p>    E   nete        Furthest/Lowest<br/>    D   paranete    Next to &apos;nete&apos;<br/>    C   trite       Third<br/>    B   paramese    Next to &apos;mese&apos;<br/>    A   mese        Middle<br/>    G   lichanos    Forefinger<br/>    F   parhypate   Next to &apos;hypate&apos;<br/>    E   hypate      Nearest/Highest</p><p> (Note that I use the &apos;octave&apos; pitch-space here only to<br/> illustrate the whole &apos;octave&apos; scale and to help modern readers<br/> understand.  Aristoxenus spoke almost entirely in terms of<br/> divisions of a tetrachord spanning a 3:4 &apos;perfect 4th&apos;.)</p><p> The distance from _nete_ to _paramese_ is a 3:4, and the<br/> distance from _mese_ to _hypate_ is a 3:4, with an 8:9 &apos;tone of<br/> disjunction&apos; between _paramese_ and _mese_.</p><p> There were other tetrachords in the complete systems,<br/> and  some were conjunct (the lowest note of the upper<br/> tetrachord is the same as the highest note of the lower<br/> tetrachord) while others were disjunct (with a tone between),<br/> and some of them used the _nete/paranete/trite_ names,<br/> while others used the _lichanos/parhypate/hypate_ names.</p><p> I&apos;m not going to go into all that, as its irrelevant<br/> to the specific thing I discuss in my paper, where Aristoxenus<br/> uses one tetrachord to describe the divisions, and says that<br/> the same divisions would occur in all other tetrachords of<br/> the complete systems.</p><p> So we&apos;ll stick with the tetrachord _mese-lichanos-parhypate-<br/> hypate_.  The Greeks thought of their scales downward, the<br/> opposite from us.</p><p> The tricky part is that the same names are used for the<br/> Chromatic and Enharmonic genera, where we would have different<br/> letter-names because of the varying interval sizes.</p><p> Aristoxenus specifically argues against this type of conception,<br/> saying that the notes in the various genera should be named<br/> according to their *function* in the scale.  This is really<br/> a lot like using Roman numerals (sometimes with accidentals)<br/> to designate scale-degrees and chords, instead of letters or<br/> Arabic pitch-class numbers.</p><p> So the fixed boundary-notes, _mese_ and _hypate_,<br/> would be analagous to our &apos;A&apos; and the &apos;E&apos; below it.<br/> _lichanos_ and _parhypate_ are the two moveable notes:</p><p>          A  mese<br/>       /<br/>      /      lichanos<br/>     3:4<br/>      \      parhypate<br/>       \<br/>        \ E  hypate</p><p> The Diatonic genus is illustrated by this tetrachord:</p><p>          A  mese<br/>       /                 &gt; tone = &apos;major 2nd&apos;<br/>      /   G  lichanos<br/>     3:4                 &gt; tone = &apos;major 2nd&apos;<br/>      \   F  parhypate<br/>       \                 &gt; semitone = &apos;minor 2nd&apos;<br/>        \ E  hypate</p><p> The distinctive thing about this genus is the interval of<br/> a tone between _mese_ and _lichanos_.  This top interval is<br/> nowadays known as the &apos;Characteristic Interval&apos; of a genus.<br/> Then the other intervals of the Diatonic (going downward)<br/> are a tone between _lichanos_ and _parhypate_, and a semitone<br/> between _parhypate_ and _hypate_.</p><p> Still with me?...</p><p> Here&apos;s the basic Chromatic genus:</p><p>          A  mese<br/>       /                 &gt; trihemitone = &apos;minor 3rd&apos;<br/>      /   F# lichanos<br/>     3:4                 &gt; semitone = &apos;minor 2nd&apos;<br/>      \   F  parhypate<br/>       \                 &gt; semitone = &apos;minor 2nd&apos;<br/>        \ E  hypate</p><p> Here, the Characteristic Interval between _mese_ and _lichanos_<br/> is one of 3 semitones, a  &apos;trihemitone&apos; (what we would call<br/> a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;).  The other two intervals are both semitones.</p><p> This is where the _pyknon_ (= &apos;compressed&apos;) comes in.  There<br/> is no pyknon in the Diatonic, because a pyknon indicates<br/> a group of two intervals that is smaller than half of the<br/> total tetrachord-space, that is, &lt; sqrt(4/3).</p><p> Aristoxenus&apos;s &apos;Relaxed Diatonic&apos; had a _lichanos_ that we<br/> could call &apos;Gv&apos;, that is, a &apos;quarter-tone&apos; between &apos;G&apos; and &apos;F#&apos;.<br/> This is the exact mid-point of the 3:4, and thus marks the<br/> lowest shade of Diatonic, as well as the lowest genus without<br/> a pyknon.  All genera with a lower _lichanos_ were Chromatic<br/> or Enharmonic, and had a pyknon.</p><p> Aristoxenus calls this particular shade of Chromatic the<br/> &apos;Tonic&apos;, because the pyknon from _lichanos_ to _hypate_ (F# to E)<br/> is a &apos;whole tone&apos;.</p><p> Here&apos;s the Enharmonic:</p><p>          A  mese<br/>       /                 &gt; ditone = &apos;major 3rd&apos;<br/>      /   F  lichanos<br/>     3:4                 &gt; enharmonic diesis = quarter-tone<br/>      \   Fv parhypate<br/>       \                 &gt; enharmonic diesis = quarter-tone<br/>        \ E  hypate</p><p> Here, the Characteristic Interval between _mese_ and _lichanos_<br/> is a &apos;ditone&apos; (what we would call a &apos;major 3rd&apos;), and the two<br/> remaining intervals are &apos;enharmonic dieses&apos;, or &apos;quarter-tones&apos;.</p><p> I said earlier that Aristoxenus describes other shades of<br/> Enharmonic which he does not measure.  He argues (without<br/> saying anything about ratios) that the one with the true<br/> ditone was used in the ancient style, which he is known to<br/> have preferred, and that modern musicians use a higher<br/> _lichanos_ to &apos;sweeten&apos; it.  This can only mean that he<br/> preferred the 64:81 Pythagorean ditone, and criticized the<br/> 4:5 used by the &apos;moderns&apos;, as measured by Didymus.  To tuning<br/> theorists, it&apos;s one of the most interesting things in his book.</p><p> But by far what I&apos;ve found to be most interesting over the<br/> years is his descriptions of the two other shades of Chromatic,<br/> the &apos;relaxed&apos; and the &apos;hemiolic&apos;.</p><p> There has been much confusion simply because Aristoxenus<br/> never says anything about ratios, but his method of tuning<br/> is patently Pythagorean (see my diagrams of &apos;Tuning by<br/> Concords&apos;).</p><p> He calls the enharmonic diesis a &apos;1/4-tone&apos;, and the smallest<br/> chromatic diesis a &apos;1/3-tone&apos;, and mentions &apos;1/6-tones&apos; and<br/> &apos;1/12&apos;-tones in his comparisions of the various genera,<br/> but as you can see from my mathematical speculations, the<br/> numbers don&apos;t jive unless you assume that he was using<br/> very loose terminology, where &apos;1/4&apos;, &apos;1/3&apos;, &apos;1/6&apos;, and &apos;1/12&apos; are<br/> only *approximations*.</p><p> Anyway, that should be enough for you to understand my paper.<br/> Hope it helps.</p><p> I&apos;ll have to give Aristoxenus a break for a while to give<br/> you any further ideas about L&amp;s.</p><p> -monz</p><p> Joseph L.
