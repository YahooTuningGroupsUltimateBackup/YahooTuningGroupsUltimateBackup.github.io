The 81/64 third is obviously<br/>further &apos;up the series&apos; than 5/4 but in some ways it&apos;s closer than at first<br/>thought possible, via the pentatonic scale:</p><p>The corresponding minor third: small by one comma:</p><p>6/5 * 80/81 = 2/1 * 16/27 = 32/27 (ol 294cents). This sounds quite<br/>interesting in a pentatonic. (Try the classic oscillating minor third, like<br/>a child&apos;s &apos;see saw dickory daw&apos;, &apos;I&apos;m the king of the castle&apos;, or many<br/>other playground chants. (The minor third is the first interval a child can<br/>recognise and sing). The 294cent third is quite tense. See Bartok articles<br/>on folk music for discussion of this property. (Oh and Lendvai - whose<br/>theories I am sure are not a function of the twelve-tone scale, but rather<br/>the mean-tone one).</p><p>&gt;You know, it almost seems as though this phenomenon should be called<br/>&gt;the &quot;high triad&quot; rather than the &quot;high third&quot; since, apparently, it<br/>&gt;only occurs in the context of a full triad.  I think I might remember<br/>&gt;this better that way.... ??<br/>&gt;(And yes, your explanation was, as usual, *very* helpful!)</p></div>
