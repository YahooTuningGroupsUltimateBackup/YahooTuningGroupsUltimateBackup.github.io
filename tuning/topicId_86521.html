The 4:5:6 in the&nbsp;C6 register sounded free and light filled, perhaps because the E was now resonanting&nbsp;with the 5th partial of&nbsp;C4.</p><p>It seemed that the&nbsp;4:5:6 chord&nbsp;altered slighlty from a minor to a major feel as I went from octave to octave.</p><p>Is the&nbsp;&apos;mood&apos; of a chord in different registers about caused by inversions&nbsp;in relation to the home register of the tonic. Being new to all this, I imagine this is obvious to many. If so could someone suggest how I learn more about the musical possibilities of this.</p><p>Steve</p></div><h3><a id=86525 href="#86525">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2010 6:43:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>16:15,9/8, 6/5,5/4,4/3, 3/2,8/5,5/3,9/5,15/8...these are all (if I have it right) considered the major and minor intervals from which 7-tone scales under 12TET temper from or &quot;approximate&quot;.</p><p>    I realize I&apos;m a bit obsessed with the alternative tone 12/11, which is right smack between the minor second at 16/15 and major second of 9/8.</p><p>     However I&apos;m interested to know what other intervals you all enjoy working with which are 12+ cents or so away from the above interval, why you like them, and in which scales they occur.
