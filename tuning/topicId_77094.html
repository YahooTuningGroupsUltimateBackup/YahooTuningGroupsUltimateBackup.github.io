First, the key is that Alpha has a very good 3/2 approximation. So, the scale can be considered as an equal division of 3/2, and you only need to notate 9 pitches. Everything else is a transposition by fifths, which is easy in a notation system based on a chain of fifths.</p><p>The next intervals to notate are the major and minor thirds, which can be notated in the usual way. I&apos;ll use D - A as a reference interval for the fifth. A minor third above D (or a major third below A is notated as F/| in Sagittal notation, and a major third above D (or a minor third below A) is notated as F||\ .</p><p>So there are 3 gaps between D and F/| to fill, and 3 gaps between F||\ and A. It will be convenient to fill these in a symmetrical way. 3 steps of Alpha approximates 8/7, and an 8/7 above D is E|) . The same interval below A (21/16 above D) is then notated as G!) . A 7-step interval is close to 11/8, which is notated as G/|\ above D, so 2 steps above D can be notated as 12/11 or E\!/ for symmetry.</p><p>Now the question is what to do about the 1 step above D or below A. Two possibilities are: notate 1 step as 21/20 (which results in 8 steps being notated as 10/7), or notate 1 step as 22/21 (or 63/44 for 8 steps). Although 21/20 uses an accented symbol .||) , there&apos;s an alternative )/|| (which actually stands for 5103/4864, if you go all the way to the 19-limit, but there&apos;s no danger of confusion in the 11-limit).</p><p>The pattern can be extended in both directions.</p><p>F     F)/|| G\!/  G|)   A!!/  A\!

With the mapping of 5/4 as 5 steps and 3/2 as 9 steps, the comma tempered out by Alpha is [13, 5, -9&gt; (1990656/1953125). In any case, I guess it&apos;s safe to ignore schisma accents in any scale with steps this large (78 cents).</p></div>
