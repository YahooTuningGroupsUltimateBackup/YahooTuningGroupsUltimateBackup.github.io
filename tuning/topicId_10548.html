Would like to figure this one out! Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;So, Daniel, stellation is only defined for an m-out-of-n CPS if n = m*2,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;right?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;No -- sorry, I&apos;m wrong about this.  On page 3 of the &quot;Letter to John<br/>&gt; &gt;Chalmers&quot;, Wilson indicates five possible solutions for a &quot;stellated<br/>&gt; &gt;dekateserany&quot;.  (All five are present in the stellated Eikosany.)  It<br/>&gt; &gt;appears that the n=2m CPSs will each have single stellations while the<br/>&gt; &gt;non-2=2m CPSs  will have m possible stellations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow- I&apos;d like to see that.  There should be exactly one complete<br/>&gt; stellation for every CPS, regardless the proportion of m and n.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How many tones would they have?  That&apos;s an interesting question.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t suspect the answer would be in Pascal&apos;s triangle.  For<br/>&gt; CPS&apos;s with 2:1 m:n, I think the answer is as simple as t + s(c),<br/>&gt; where t is the number of tones in the un-stellated structure, c<br/>&gt; is the number of un-saturated chords in the CPS, and s is the<br/>&gt; number of identities needed to saturate the CPS&apos;s basic chord.<br/>&gt; The 14 tones of the stellated hexany make sense here; each of the<br/>&gt; hexany&apos;s 8 triads needs 1 extra note.  The something is different<br/>&gt; with the 70 tones of the stellated eikosany, tho; each of its 30<br/>&gt; tetrads needs 2 extra notes, giving 80, but according to Chalmers<br/>&gt; the stellated 1*3*5*7*9*11 eik. has 70 notes.  So either 10 notes<br/>&gt; are redundant due to the composite 9-factor, or 10 points are<br/>&gt; getting re-used somewhere and my formula is incorrect (which is<br/>&gt; unlikely, since the chords of the CPS will already exploit the<br/>&gt; maximum number of common-tone relations in prime-factor JI: 2).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For non-2:1-m:n CPS&apos;s, the answer is more difficult, since s is<br/>&gt; not a constant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Was the salesman clueless?
