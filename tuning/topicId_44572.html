Hogwood and J.Schroder the<br/>&gt; early symphonies where played with harpsichord continuo but not the<br/>&gt; later ones. As far as I remember, in the notes, it is stated that this<br/>&gt; choice corresponds to and historical change in practices. It was also<br/>&gt; alleged that that the later symphonies where sufficiently &quot;fleshed<br/>&gt; out&quot; to not necessitate keyboard continuo. But from from Monz&apos;s<br/>&gt; comment<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the choice of pitches/tuning was already made by Mozart<br/>&gt; &gt; in his choice of notation. 55edo has an established<br/>&gt; &gt; (i.e., &quot;premeditated calculation&quot;) tuning and he chose<br/>&gt; &gt; particular notes from it in writing his pieces. in<br/>&gt; &gt; the first movement of his 40th Symphony, he uses 19<br/>&gt; &gt; different pitches (based on the assumption that sharps<br/>&gt; &gt; are different from their &quot;enharmonically-equivalent&quot; flats).<br/>&gt; &gt; and it&apos;s fascinating to see how he limits his set of<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches for certain sections of the music, then expands<br/>&gt; &gt; the set at other places by adding new flats, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it seems that there is more than that. The use of fixed tuned continuo<br/>&gt; instrument in early symphonies precludes the enharmonic distinction (I<br/>&gt; think that splitted black keys where beginning to be uncommon by<br/>&gt; Mozart time??). So it seems that removing the harpsichord was<br/>&gt; necessary to give room to extra intonation sophistication of later<br/>&gt; symphonies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we may suppose that the symphonic genre moved from a keyboard<br/>&gt; driven intonation to string driven intonation by the time of mozart:<br/>&gt; the just tuning of string quartet instrument become the most important<br/>&gt; intonation constraint (if the idea that sympathetic vibration of open<br/>&gt; strings is correct). I do not remember at which time/symphony number<br/>&gt; the harpsichord continuo has ceased to be used, but Monz&apos;s comment<br/>&gt; suggest that it was a great paradigm shift in orchestra intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am wondering if at the time Haydn composed his &quot;sturm und drang&quot;<br/>&gt; symphonies (experimental music for the time) he intended performance<br/>&gt; with keyboard continuo. In those symphonies, Haydn experiment unusual<br/>&gt; key signatures.</p><p>hmmm ... i find this *very* interesting!  i think you&apos;re<br/>onto something here.  i had never thought about the fact<br/>that symphonic music used to require a harpsichord in the<br/>ensemble.</p><p>it makes sense to me that the _sturm und drang_ style<br/>might have provided an impetus for the expulsion of the<br/>harpsichord from the symphony orchestra.</p><p>i&apos;m well aware of the harpsichord/non-harpsichord<br/>situation in Haydn&apos;s body of work, but it&apos;s been so<br/>long since i&apos;ve listened to early Mozart symphonies<br/>that i&apos;d forgotten that they used harpsichord as well.</p><p>when was Mozart&apos;s _sturm und drang_ period?  the period<br/>is generally considered in German literature to have<br/>extended from about 1770-1784.  Haydn&apos;s _sturm und drang_<br/>symphonies were written in the late 1760s and early 1770s.</p><p>Mozart was a teenager during these years, and he was<br/>composing a lot.  but had he already reached the maturity<br/>one would expect him to need to compose in _sturm und drang_<br/>style?  or was his _sturm und drang_ period later than Haydn&apos;s?</p><p>-monz</p></div>
