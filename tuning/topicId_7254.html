A diminished triad most<br/>&gt; commonly contains a functional tritone (presumably<br/>&gt; the same one that drove Medieval theorists nuts) that<br/>&gt; acoustically must make up its mind regarding its allegiance.<br/>&gt; It is only the tempered keyboard tritone that is immune.<br/>&gt; An acoustic tritone (5:7 or 7:10) appears to lean one way<br/>&gt; or the other and tunes accordingly. For example, a B-F<br/>&gt; tritone (diminished fifth) relates to a C tonic while a<br/>&gt; B-E# tritone (augmented fourth) relates to an F# tonic.</p><p>Gerald: I agree with your description here as it pertains<br/>to JI dyads [= &apos;intervals&apos;] and triads, at least as far as<br/>Renaissance-to-&apos;common practice&apos; and perhaps much of the JI<br/>or quasi-JI pop and folk music of every era.</p><p>But note that Daniel Wolf did not say that &apos;diminished triads<br/>... conform to a tempered configuration&apos;.  He simply noted<br/>that &apos;some schemes [of adaptive JI] make augmented and diminished<br/>chords equal tempered&apos;.</p><p>I think what Mr. Wolf really meant was &apos;diminished *7th*&apos;<br/>chords.  His point was (one made in this List over and over<br/>again) that chords which divide the &apos;octave&apos; into a certain<br/>number of identical intervals, for example, an &apos;augmented<br/>triad&apos; with 3 &apos;major 3rds&apos; or a &apos;diminished 7th&apos; with 4<br/>&apos;minor 3rds&apos;, generally only &apos;work&apos; when tuned in an appropriate<br/>ET; 12-tET in the case of the two examples given.</p><p>Some have argued that composers would not have used these<br/>two particular chords in the particular ways they did (and do),<br/>especially around 100 years ago (say from around Wagner to<br/>Schoenberg and Debussy), if 12-tET had not become the accepted<br/>norm and thus influenced these composers&apos;s thinking.</p><p>I think it&apos;s significant that Schoenberg in particular found<br/>so much to explore among the &apos;augmented triads&apos;, &apos;diminished 7th<br/>chords&apos;, and &apos;4th-chords&apos;, all of which pretty much require<br/>12-tET, since it is the smallest ET which can produce them all<br/>within a closed system.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

On the other hand, a &quot;chord&quot; that divides the octave<br/>into 2 equal parts is clearly improved by making one of the parts 7:5 and<br/>the other 10:7, rather than ET.</p><p>&gt;I think it&apos;s significant that Schoenberg in particular found<br/>&gt;so much to explore among the &apos;augmented triads&apos;, &apos;diminished 7th<br/>&gt;chords&apos;, and &apos;4th-chords&apos;, all of which pretty much require<br/>&gt;12-tET, since it is the smallest ET which can produce them all<br/>&gt;within a closed system.</p><p>Don&apos;t see that for &apos;4th-chords&apos; unless they include 12 different notes.<br/>&apos;4th-chords&apos; of 3-5 notes are especially cool in 22-tET or any tuning with<br/>~709-cent fifths, since the intevals produced approximate 7:4, 7:3, and 7:9.<br/>&apos;5th-chords&apos; of 4-5 notes are especially nice in meantones, where you get<br/>approximations to 5:3 and 5:2.</p><p>Merry Christmas to all!!!!!!!</p></div>
