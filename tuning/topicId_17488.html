Of course, the format is a<br/>&gt; bit young to know how long its shelf life REALLY is, but I have printed CDs<br/>&gt; from about 15 years ago that are still fine, whereas I haven&apos;t seen a floppy<br/>&gt; disk more than about six years old that still works.</p><p>These days, I&apos;ve started to archive my DATs onto CD, one of the many reasons<br/>I bought the CD burner. Conversely, I&apos;ve also thought of making DAT copies<br/>of important things that I&apos;ve recorded onto the CD burner. Regardless of<br/>what anyone says about life span of formats, I don&apos;t trust any of them<br/>further than I can throw them, as the saying goes.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>&quot;The secret to staying calm in a crisis is in not knowing all the facts.&quot;<br/>                                            Lefty, &quot;Lives of the Cowboys&quot;</p></div>
