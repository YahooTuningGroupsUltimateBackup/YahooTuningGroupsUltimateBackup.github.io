It looks pretty cool.  Good<br/>for those who can afford it and not Kyma.  I&apos;m not sure I need and can<br/>afford both, as there&apos;s a big overlap.  But the writeup is very inspiring.</p><p>Yes, I know, +/- 100 cents isn&apos;t perfect, but it&apos;s a lot better than<br/>nothing.  And, given it&apos;s all software, they might improve it if<br/>registered users ask them.</p><p>Does anybody else have news on tunable soft synths?  The latest VAZ+ demo<br/>I have says it supports tuning tables, but the example wasn&apos;t where it<br/>should be.  So has anybody got it working?

Barry Vercoe (CSound&apos;s originator) has worked with ANalog<br/>Devices for a number of years on porting to their DSP chips, but I don&apos;t<br/>know if anything commercial exists or if you have to buy the chips and do<br/>your own hardware integration. THis setup is covered on one of the CD-ROMS<br/>in &quot;The CSound Book&quot;. WIndows is not and never will be a real-time OS. My<br/>friends at Forth, Inc. make a very nice Windows FOrth that can do some<br/>impressive things, but there are still mysterious pauses while Windows<br/>does its thing. I haven&apos;t played with NT or Win2K at all to see if it&apos;s<br/>any better.</p><p>&gt; I wasn&apos;t aware the VL series supported tuning tables.  But sure enough,<br/>&gt; they&apos;re on John Loffink&apos;s list.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember whether I checked this or not; the WX5 has a manual pitch<br/>bend control on it and my plan was to re-tune on the fly by passing MIDI<br/>through a computer on its way from the WX5 to the VL70-m. Tuning tables<br/>would be a big plus. The VL70-m looks quite programmable; they have<br/>something called an &quot;Expert Editor&quot; that lets you get down and personal<br/>with the hardware, although the typical musician probably won&apos;t be able to<br/>do anything useful with it. What wasn&apos;t clear to me from the manual was<br/>how monophonic the VL70-m is. There are some hooks for polyphony, although<br/>it is clearly sold as a monophonic device. I am a flute player, and I am<br/>pretty much useless on a standard keyboard.  As I said before, I have<br/>wanted a synthesizer that I could play like a flute; indeed some 27 years<br/>or so ago I sketched an analog device that could in fact do that, although<br/>I never built it.</p><p>--<br/><a href="mailto:znmeb@teleport.com">znmeb@teleport.com</a> (M.
