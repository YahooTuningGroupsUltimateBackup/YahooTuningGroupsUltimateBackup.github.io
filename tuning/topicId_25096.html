In other words, Hanon studies on<br/>piano should not, but might influence the rhythms of a composition if a<br/>pianist is composing on a piano.  Many other composition teachers share in<br/>this view.

It<br/>was a fudge-type math.  Accuracy was exchanged for &quot;concept&quot; understanding.<br/>After a few years of teaching this way, the graduates could not keep up in<br/>later grades.  The approach was scrapped and the students were furious.  This<br/>stuff happens in Long Island.</p><p>If as a bassoonist, I gave the easier fingering for a musical sound, the<br/>listener would be short changed in pitch, timbre, character, emotion,<br/>dynamic, and articulation.
