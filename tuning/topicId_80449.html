Sheiman procedure he shortly referred to me but I was wrong due to the great number of posts discussing this matter. Since a time ago I see that relations N/17, N/19 are beeing studied; it is a mystery for me how and why this numerical tools started to be taken into account.</p><p>The aim of this message is to inform you that in about two more days I will send a proposal of a scale that works with eight schismas (M = 32805/32768) combined with four J Piagui commas; the twelve parameters work in connection with six scale narrow fifths. I will post it mainly because the total product of these musical parameters gives the Pythagorean comma: (M^8)(J^4). Its numeric proximity to the ET sounds normal since the ETS is not a badly scale. I suggest you to study my proposal that will probably be the last one.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Mario</p><p>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, February 01</p></div>
