A part of or different parts of a movement may be based<br/>entirely on the major or minor tonal scales as we know [them] in our<br/>usual tonality system--then just as naturally, as soon as the ear has<br/>had some acquisition and use, this and other tonal groups may be used<br/>together in other passages, and find their natural part in the general<br/>expression--then the other tonal groups may be used only--the ear,<br/>with practice in listening and hearing, making reasonable and natural<br/>chordal and melodic ways of expressing what is underneath the music.</p><p>As to the matter of implied changes in the tone of a note (usually<br/>only one or two in a chord say of from six to eight notes) which when<br/>played on a piano does not change, but which the player can think of<br/>aurally as going higher or lower, as the case may be (see typewritten<br/>chart of measured or tonal-difference beats, etc.)--in many cases (as<br/>in the example above, p. 1){15} the accidental mark (call [it] key<br/>index--though really not an accidental, [but] a sign for a different<br/>ratio of overtonal vibrations) is made to suggest and conform to the<br/>above theory--in other places so as not to bring to mind a tonality<br/>which does not exist, and so not [to] feel or think about not having a<br/>key. This is so it won&apos;t mislead the eye first, then as a result also<br/>the ear and the mind et al.</p><p>Of course all this leads back to whether a man&apos;s ear, mind, etc. is<br/>naturally willing or not naturally willing--rather whether he feels<br/>that the system as we know it, that of tonality, is a field too<br/>closely fenced in to be all it might be (that is, not entirely<br/>natural)--whether the laws we all learned, to the point almost of<br/>saturation, from Jadassohn, Goodrich, Richter &amp; Co. didn&apos;t gradually<br/>cave in and seem to grow into nice apron-strings--as a kind of feeling<br/>that the field is getting smaller and smaller and with more and more<br/>fences. As a specimen of just one fence, the picket--of the leading<br/>tone, so called--instead of a leading tone, often more of a<br/>withdrawing tone--its importance in the treatises was not (though<br/>called so) because it was a natural process of tonal science, but<br/>because it was easy for the ear to be led thusly. How thoroughly we<br/>learned the nice rules and obeyed them (but sometimes didn&apos;t and<br/>played hooky) or was it submitted to them, until one day, when a man<br/>becomes of age, the ear begins to sit up and think some for<br/>itself--and somehow that imperfect triad seems to grow less imperfect,<br/>and those two leading tones (or rather being led by tonic supremacy)<br/>get tiered of that, some of that, semitone groove back home, etc.--and<br/>the melodic tendency scolds, for the smoothness and correctness of the<br/>whole resolution is endangered. But the ear begins to look for more<br/>trails up the mountain. Thus it&apos;s now more than a resolution that&apos;s<br/>endangered--all music is endangered!--Rollo told me so.</p><p>So two notes standing alone a whole tone apart seem (to the nice<br/>classroom) to be a nice sign that they are a part of the dominant<br/>seventh, and must act obediently--but the ear sometimes doesn&apos;t feel<br/>exactly that way--so we must be fair and change that sign. Suppose two<br/>curves, an up and down, start on Eb and Db, and are held down hard<br/>through the arpeggios and back, and we don&apos;t land in Ab major--that<br/>sign isn&apos;t fair, Rollo, it points us the wrong way--so the sign-maker<br/>makes it C# and Eb, and the music via the ear takes its own way up the<br/>mountain better, and feels better about [it]. For instance, just as an<br/>illustration or instance [of] wrong signs made nearer right, or at<br/>least away from a misleading tendency-- see _Thoreau_, page 61, 2nd<br/>brace, chord [at] beginning of 6th quarter-note beat--this is L.H.:<br/>C#-F#-E,{16} R.H.: G#-F-Bb--if the right-hand G# had been put an Ab,<br/>the eye would probably, to most, have suggested a resolution to a nice<br/>Eb major tonic chord, even in spite of the C# in the left hand with F#<br/>and E over [it] which may seem to lead towards a B gate--but it<br/>doesn&apos;t get there, Rollo!</p><p>This is just one technical explanation of why certain notes have been<br/>written as they have, in the Sonata and other music. No more technical<br/>notes and explanations today, Rollo, for Edith and Susanna have their<br/>own and better notes in the back yard!</p><p>Then, to my way of hearing and thinking, a sharp is a kind of<br/>underlying sign of, or senses and reflects or encourages, an upward<br/>movement, tonal and more perhaps spiritual, at a thing somewhat more<br/>of courage and aspiration-towards than the flat carries or seems<br/>to--the flat is more relaxing, subservient, looking more for rest<br/>[and] submission, etc.--often used as symbols as such, when they&apos;re<br/>not needed as the signs of tonality in the usual way. (Charles E.<br/>Ives, _Memos_, pp. 193-95)</p><p>________________<br/>{15} That is, on p. 1 of the manuscript--see note 4 above.</p><p>{16} Ives absent-mindedly wrote D instead of E, but he refers to it<br/>correctly further on. In the new editions, this chord is on p. 59, in<br/>the middle of the second brace.</p><p>PS - This is the text excerpt (p. 188) and footnote that Kirkpatrick<br/>references (&quot;see note 4 above&quot;) in note 15 (note 7, and the text it<br/>refers to were contained in the post &quot;missed by the unimaginative,&quot; TD<br/>359.23):</p><p>And Ethelboy says--&quot;Why that fellow doesn&apos;t understand music at<br/>all--he writes B#,{4} then he doesn&apos;t know he must go nice to C#<br/>minor--...&quot;</p><p>{4} This &quot;B#&quot; is probably the same one as at note 7 below, or possibly<br/>the one ending line 4 of p. 34 of the revised edition.</p></div>
