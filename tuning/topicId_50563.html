Gene gave you a couple of<br/>great examples. Another important one, at least for 5-limit, would be<br/>Kleismic-15:</p><p>            0<br/>       68.319<br/>       180.44<br/>       248.76<br/>       317.08<br/>        385.4<br/>       497.52<br/>       565.84<br/>       634.16<br/>       702.48<br/>        814.6<br/>       882.92<br/>       951.24<br/>       1019.6<br/>       1131.7</p><p>Lots of quite pure major and minor triads here.</p><p>&gt;    are these 2 things related?  What are &quot;vanishing commas&quot;? Does<br/>&gt;12 EDO<br/>&gt; have them<br/>&gt;    and why? Does 15 EDO have them and why?</p><p>I&apos;m glad you finally (and pretty quickly) understood Gene&apos;s comment<br/>on this. More could be said. See my reply to Mark, which I hope<br/>you&apos;ll read and try to follow. In that post I brought up the &apos;maximal<br/>diesis&apos;, which can be expressed as 250;243 -- it vanishes in 15-equal<br/>but not in 12-equal. This implies certain &apos;porcupine&apos; scale<br/>formations and chord progressions which work in 15-equal but not in<br/>12-equal -- Herman Miller has explored these in his music. Meanwhile,<br/>perhaps the most important comma of all, the &apos;syntonic comma&apos; or<br/>simply &apos;the comma&apos; or 81;80, vanishes in 12-equal but not in 15-<br/>equal; thus most conventional common-practice triadic diatonic music<br/>will work in 12-equal but not in 15-equal.</p></div>
