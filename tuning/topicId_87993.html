The foundations of it can be found in chapters 4, 6 and 10 of my book (in the &quot;Files&quot; section, JohnOSullivan folder). I treat the harmonic series of a note as a chord with an infinite number of elements but I just use the first 1024 harmonics/partials to get a &apos;feel&apos; for things. Then I pair each of the first 1024 &apos;elements&apos; of both notes in an interval using my formula:<br/>(1/x + 1/y - diss(x,y)) to get the consonance value of the interval.</p><p>Try the calculator. I&apos;ve tested it and found it accurate using a Church Organ &quot;voice&quot; on my keyboard but not so accurate with other instruments with different timbres. It is aimed at instruments whose timbres are close to the ideal (i.e. the harmonics have frequencies of exactly x, 2x, 3x, 4x etc. and the amplitudes of the harmonics are exactly y, y/2, y/3, y/4 etc.)</p><p>John.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2010 4:24:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene,</p><p>&gt; Try the calculator.
