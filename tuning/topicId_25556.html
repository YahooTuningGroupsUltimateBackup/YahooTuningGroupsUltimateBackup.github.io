I was fascinated with<br/>the music, and what stuck with me at the time was no so much any focus<br/>on &quot;microtonality&quot; or &quot;just intonation,&quot; but the idea of someone<br/>actually designing all of these new and original instruments and<br/>bringing together an assortment of world musical traditions to create<br/>a very distinctive art.</p><p>Curiously, in some ways, my approach may be quite different than<br/>Partch&apos;s, so that this auspicious day is also an opportunity to<br/>celebrate diversity. At the same time, I recognize that Partch has<br/>played an instrumental role -- pun intended -- in getting &quot;on the<br/>radar screen&quot; some of the ratios which I favor in my own music, even<br/>in a &quot;neo-Pythagorean&quot; fashion which might or might not fit Partch&apos;s<br/>own outlook and high art of &quot;Monophony.&quot;</p><p>Of course, that art isn&apos;t _only_ the music -- any more than the opera<br/>or oratorio of the era around 1600, or the kind of theatrical<br/>performance which at least I enjoy envisioning for the _Roman de<br/>Fauvel_ around 1316, can be represented by the notes alone.</p><p>When I heard some of Partch&apos;s music some 25 years ago at that friend&apos;s<br/>house, among the pieces were his settings of hobo-related texts.<br/>Looking back, I reflect on what might have been a fateful encounter in<br/>his life between Walt Whitman&apos;s joyous tradition of &quot;The Open Road&quot;<br/>and the brutal reality of the Depression in the U.S.A., when poverty<br/>could be literally a crime.</p><p>To honor Harry Partch, in however modest a way, I would like to share<br/>a MIDI file of a just intonation progression which I hope may bring<br/>some enjoyment to people on this List upon this auspicious occasion:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/xgji001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/xgji001.mid</a></p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=25558 href="#25558">ðŸ”—</a>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2001 11:40:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MARGO!</p><p>Enough with the samples, i want a CD!</p><p>Beautiful progression, just awesome.</p><p>Do you have anything available?
