Everything is possible if one finds a<br/>good way of mapping. I tried many things like this, so I couldn&apos;t<br/>omit games. I have converted Rubik Cube solving to music, and have<br/>some plans to use Japanese chess shogi game for music generating.<br/>They are more complex than standard chess, more characters, more<br/>movements and some other interesting aspects. For sure I will use<br/>different approach, for me is more interesting to convert moves of<br/>characters. Position conversion is rather simple.</p><p>Few years ago I wa also thinking about some kind of 3D chess where<br/>characters could move in 3D space, for example matrix of 10x10x10<br/>cubes, and map movements to pitch, timbre and volume.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 8 Feb 2010, at 5:02 PM, Sarn Ursell wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of the original microtonal music pieces which I did, was,<br/>&gt; actually a game of chess which I played against the computer mapped<br/>&gt; to 64ET, one degree of the chromatic scale for each square on the<br/>&gt; chess board!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first row is notes one to eight (of 64ET), the second row notes<br/>&gt; 9 to 16 (of 64ET), the third row notes 17 to 24 (of 64ET)etc&mldr;..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each move then plays a chord of 32 notes which gradually get less<br/>&gt; and less 31, 30, 29, 28...etc...as each peice is captured.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have actually emailed the moderators of this website:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.chessvariants.org/">http://www.chessvariants.org/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To suggest to them the possibilities of mapping chess variants to<br/>&gt; microtonal music, after, of course, explaining WHAT microtonal<br/>&gt; music is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They seemed mildly interested, but couldn&apos;t really understand the<br/>&gt; point of this exercise, but again, it is all about EXPERIMENTATION,<br/>&gt; and hearing what it would sound like....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please tell me if anyone on the alternative tuning list had ever<br/>&gt; heard about any composer mapping a game of chess to a musical<br/>&gt; composition, microtonal or otherwise?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought it fitting to mention chess variants specifically because<br/>&gt; this is another interest of mine, and it just seemed fitting that<br/>&gt; chess variants and music variants should go hand-in-hand, so to<br/>&gt; speak...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I then do suppose that other variants, like a 10 by 10 board with<br/>&gt; the zebra piece (please see the website....), could be mapped to<br/>&gt; 100ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What needs to be done by me now is to go through all of my<br/>&gt; compositions and make a judgment as to their originality, but I<br/>&gt; will still seek free legal advice from a lawyer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, please do checkout the Odd Music Gallery.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----Sarn.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86080 href="#86080">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2010 2:58:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Is your chess music piece available somewhere?
