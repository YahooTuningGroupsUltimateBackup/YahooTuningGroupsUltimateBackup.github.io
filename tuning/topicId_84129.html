Comments welcome.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> Q: What is &quot;just intonation&quot;?</p><p> A: Generally, it means tuning instruments so that pitches are<br/>related to one another by simple ratios.  For example, A = 440 Hz<br/>and E = 660 Hz are related by the ratio 3/2.  In equal<br/>temperament, this A-E &quot;perfect fifth&quot; is very close to 3/2, but<br/>differs by a precise amount so that the circle of fifths returns<br/>us to the pitch we started on.</p><p>There are three sources of disagreement over the precise meaning<br/>of the term, however.  First, What qualifies as a simple ratio?<br/>Is 19/16 simple?  Historically, only ratios that can be factored<br/>with primes no greater than 5 were considered simple.<br/>Contemporary authors tend to be more inclusive, but the phrase<br/>&quot;extended just intonation&quot; is sometimes used to indicate that<br/>primes greater than 5 are being allowed.</p><p>Second, What tuning accuracy is required?  If we have 440 Hz and<br/>660.2 Hz, does it count as 3/2?  One answer is that if the tuning<br/>error is being applied intentionally (in a systematic way), then<br/>it should not be considered just intonation.  If instead the<br/>error is a result of the limited accuracy of an instrument (and<br/>is therefore somewhat random over the range of the instrument),<br/>we can still consider the result to be just intonation.</p><p>Finally, Which intervals should be considered when more than two<br/>pitches are involved?  The classical &quot;just intonation&quot; scale has<br/>the pitches: 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1.  It contains<br/>chords like 4/3 5/3 2/1, which simplify to 4:5:6 and which are<br/>certainly just intonation chords.  But it also contains the chord<br/>9/8 4/3 5/3, which simplifies to 27:32:40 and sounds quite harsh<br/>if a consonant minor triad is expected.  Nevertheless, it is<br/>often implied that whatever combination of pitches we pluck from<br/>a scale like the one above, we are still in just intonation.</p><p>An alternative is to consider just intonation to be a property of<br/>chords (simultaneous pitches) only.  Scales can then be discussed<br/>in terms of how many justly intoned chords they contain, what<br/>portion of their triads are justly intoned, etc.  Except for the<br/>harmonic series itself (and only the first few octaves thereof),<br/>all rational scales with more than a handful of pitches/octave<br/>contain chords that fail classical tests of just intonation, such<br/>as being easy to tune by ear.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
