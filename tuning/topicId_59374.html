They are the tension-creators. Without their<br/>presence in a raga, the vadi-samvadi cannot achieve resolution.</p><p>Cay we say, therefore, that these passing  and neighboring notes, in a<br/>way, act as leading notes?</p><p>Lastly, are they responsible for the &quot;rule&quot; that a raga must have at<br/>least five notes? [The raga-s with less than five notes are very few,<br/>and considered exceptions.]</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
