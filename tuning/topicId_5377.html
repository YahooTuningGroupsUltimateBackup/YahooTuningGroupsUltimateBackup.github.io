Such an adaptive tuning is analogous to the kind<br/>of retuning done on piano strings - though the deviations of<br/>the partials in many inharmonic instruments may be many<br/>orders of magnitude greater than the kinds of deviations present<br/>in strings.</p><p>In fact, I wrote an article describing this technique in detail in the<br/>J. Acoustical Society called &quot;Adaptive tunings for musical<br/>scales&quot; and I am nearing completion of a version<br/>written in MAX (a MIDI programming<br/>language) that I will put on my web site as soon as I can.<br/>Of course, it will be limited to MIDI instruments,<br/>and I have had to make several concessions to make<br/>it work fast enough for &quot;real time&quot; retuning.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
