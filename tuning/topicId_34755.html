There was a letter to the editor published in the New<br/>York Times Book review that mentioned our temperament recordings by name,  as<br/>a rebuttal to the Jamie James reviewer.  The writer of the letter didn&apos;t rant<br/>an rage enough, of course, but it certainly started some interest in what has<br/>happened to the scale over the last 300 years.<br/>   Many reviewers got heat for their &quot;glowing&quot; reviews of &quot;Temperament&quot;, so I<br/>think that there is possibly some fear on many reviewers&apos; part to even<br/>approach the subject.  We could possibly do more to educate them, but there<br/>is resistance, even to that.<br/>      I&apos;m still working on the piano tuning community, but have begun to<br/>enlighten the students that I get around.  So far,  two universities here are<br/>now  &quot;temperament friendly&quot;, and a another is interested.  This is all local,<br/>of course, but eventually the format will present itself for Isacoff to find<br/>himself engaged in debate over just what &quot;equal&quot; means.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2002 6:46:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/34765">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/34765</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, frankly, if it is so loaded with errors, I wish that people<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; this list, including myself... although I don&apos;t know if I have<br/>enough<br/>&gt; &gt; background to contribute much, would write a *COUNTER* Isakoff<br/>&gt; &gt; article or book, written in *layman&apos;s* terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could always write a review for Amazon, I suppose.

Spells &quot;Partch&quot; as if he were<br/>German.</p><p>&gt; But the Point is that whatever his credentials are (and you, as well<br/>&gt; as any smart person on this list, certainly knows how puffed up a<br/>&gt; resume can be), they are good enough to snare a publisher and to get<br/>&gt; press for himself. My guess: he is a very self-promotional person,<br/>&gt; and *wanted* to get this book published.</p><p>Getting a publisher is one thing.  Getting press takes more than a resume.<br/> Either it&apos;s an unusually good book or he got lucky.</p><p>&gt; This parallels a topic that comes up from time to time on this list:<br/>&gt; why things don&apos;t happen. I mean Absolutely No Disrespect to my<br/>&gt; colleagues on the list(s), but putting a paper up on a website, or<br/>&gt; posting an mp3, is NOT going to make you either a household word, or<br/>&gt; attract the attention of Big Media or Big Concert Promoters.</p><p>Putting up a website can get your message across to thousands of people.<br/>That&apos;s very good if you aren&apos;t a household word, and don&apos;t have the<br/>attention of Big Media or Big Concert Promoters (TM).  As I think the<br/>examples above show, the web&apos;s doing a good job of presenting the<br/>objections to Isacoff&apos;s (alleged -- I haven&apos;t read it) simplistic thesis.<br/>It&apos;s also going to reach more people than one popular-academic book.</p><p>If somebody here actually spent the time to list the factual errors in the<br/>book, and put them on a web page, it might well be picked up by the search<br/>engines.  That could make a difference, but somebody has to do some work<br/>first.</p><p>&gt; Answer this: which will be noticed more - Isakoff&apos;s book, flawed as<br/>&gt; it might be, or an article in a journal such as Perspectives of New<br/>&gt; Music? I know which one I might give more credence to, but you can&apos;t<br/>&gt; fault someone for their ability to have written what should have been<br/>&gt; a musicological text in a way that someone, somewhere, thought they<br/>&gt; could market to a larger, more generalized audience.</p><p>If Isacoff (note the speling) had written an unsuccessful book, very few<br/>people would have got to see it.  An unsuccessful article in PNM will<br/>equally have little impact.  A successful article in PNM could get onto<br/>the curriculum in music colleges around the world, and be a direct<br/>influence on leading composers.  A successful web page can be read by<br/>millions of people.
