Personally If you are going to try to tell me that I do not write music in<br/>Just Intonation, I can only assume, you are nuts and place you in that Category of a Stalinist<br/>such as  Breton who thinks he can decides who is a a surrealist or not.<br/>2) The  purpose of separating Medieval 5 limit Just Intonation from the traditions of Greece<br/>and Persia  functions only to satisfy a revisionist historical perspective where Just<br/>intonation could be labeled a parthenogenic product of Europe. A rather isolationist view. I<br/>hope this is not what you want otherwise i am out of here.<br/>3) It has been pointed out that at a certain point JI and not be distinguished for ET. True<br/>to the extent at looking at single intervals. This is true only if we look at the noun and not<br/>the verb as The approach is different and we shouldn&apos;t lose sight of this. That Kirnberger<br/>uses high ratios to determined the size of his intervals should not make us lose sight of what<br/>he was trying to do.

It is not<br/>uncommon for me to tune a number of instruments to different<br/>simultaneous scales (4-8), so that when you play across a chromatic<br/>scale, a cluster chord (but not the Henry Cowell variety!) of near<br/>unison pitches is played containing separate ratios on each scale<br/>degree. It is possible to create some very lovely beating when you<br/>perform a thematic line, and with JI, each note of the chromatic<br/>scale can yeild a completely unique cluster chord. This is one of the<br/>JI phenomenon I mentioned, that might not fall to gracefully on all<br/>ears.

Personally If you are going to try to tell me<br/>that I do not write music in<br/>&gt; Just Intonation, I can only assume, you are nuts and place you in<br/>that Category of a Stalinist<br/>&gt; such as  Breton who thinks he can decides who is a a surrealist or<br/>not.</p><p>&gt; 2) The  purpose of separating Medieval 5 limit Just Intonation from<br/>the traditions of Greece and Persia  functions only to satisfy a<br/>revisionist historical perspective where Just intonation could be<br/>labeled a parthenogenic product of Europe. A rather isolationist<br/>view.<br/>I hope this is not what you want otherwise i am out of here.</p><p>&gt; 3) It has been pointed out that at a certain point JI and not be<br/>distinguished for ET. True<br/>&gt; to the extent at looking at single intervals. This is true only if<br/>we look at the noun and not<br/>&gt; the verb as The approach is different and we shouldn&apos;t lose sight<br/>of<br/>this. That Kirnberger<br/>&gt; uses high ratios to determined the size of his intervals should not<br/>make us lose sight of what<br/>&gt; he was trying to do. That is tempering and i think his tunings<br/>should be called &quot;temperments&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hello Kraig!</p><p>I am very sorry if you found some of my posts offensive.  I think<br/>there must be a misunderstanding!  In the first place, I have no &quot;ax&quot;<br/>to grind, instrumental or otherwise.  I really don&apos;t really care<br/>_what is_ or _what is not_ called just intonation!</p><p>I was just trying to figure out for myself if people called high<br/>integer music just intonation...  I didn&apos;t know.  Obviously you do.</p><p>Like I said, I don&apos;t care one way or the other... I was just trying<br/>to understand the concept, since I had never thought too much about<br/>high integer rational music before, and you OBVIOUSLY have!!!</p><p>I was more trying to contrast &quot;integer&quot; and &quot;high integer&quot; music with<br/>&quot;irrational&quot; values... i.e. &quot;tempered&quot; values that were &quot;irrational&quot;<br/>numbers.</p><p>I frankly had forgotten my math... and I was a little naively<br/>thrilled with the difference between the &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;irrational.&quot;</p><p>If all &quot;rational&quot; music is just... perhaps there is true justice in<br/>the world!</p><p>I was only exploring the math ideas and the music ideas...
