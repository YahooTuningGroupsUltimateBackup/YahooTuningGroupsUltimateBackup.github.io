I&apos;ll have to take a look.<br/>&gt; [CL:}<br/>&gt; Promising technology for microtonalists, to be sure.  For<br/>&gt; infinite flexibility we loose velocity and aftertouch, so<br/>&gt; we&apos;d be stuck to organ-type patches if we wanted them to<br/>&gt; sound good.</p><p>It wouldn&apos;t be that bad.  An expression pedal would give you dynamics<br/>for piano, guitar, or other percussive sounds -- you just wouldn&apos;t<br/>have it on independently on each note.</p><p>&gt; We also loose tactile feedback, which would probably make<br/>&gt; sight reading impossible.</p><p>In my opinion this is the most serious shortcoming, and it would also<br/>make real-time performance involving more than one note at a time<br/>(especially for two hands) rather difficult -- better to have a real<br/>keyboard for performance.</p><p>But it would be a very valuable tool for the composer, both for<br/>exploring tunings and for inputting data into a MIDI file (in<br/>conjunction with software that would insert pitch-bends<br/>automatically).</p><p>&gt; Notation could be replaced on<br/>&gt; these instruments by a &apos;follow the lights&apos; approach, in<br/>&gt; which the whole key can light up, if you like!  Graham,<br/>&gt; are you listening?</p><p>Or keys might be in different colors, though that might be more<br/>expensive than the examples in monochrome (red) that I saw in the<br/>links you gave.  An alternative would be different fill patterns<br/>(solid, hollow, lines, crosshatch, etc.) for the key surfaces that<br/>would guide the experienced user (to replace note labeling in the<br/>notation of one&apos;s choice, which would be of more use to the novice);<br/>two colors used in conjunction with fill patterns might be ideal.</p><p>&gt; Certainly exciting that technology exists to bring the holy<br/>&gt; grail of an infinitely configurable, extremely portable<br/>&gt; keyboard within reach of the consumer (indeed: cheap!).</p><p>Indeed!  And it would be a wonderful way to test out keyboard designs<br/>before building them as hardware.</p><p>&gt; In the year between msg. 35809 and 41680, it went from<br/>&gt; trade-show demo to at least two companies providing OEM<br/>&gt; kits.  Assuming there&apos;s a flexible inferface in there<br/>&gt; somewhere, a microtonal keyboard software project (perhaps<br/>&gt; two projectors would be needed for a full keyboard) might<br/>&gt; not be too difficult...</p><p>So who&apos;s going to start the ball rolling?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=41825 href="#41825">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2003 12:58:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; In the year between msg. 35809 and 41680, it went from<br/>&gt; &gt; trade-show demo to at least two companies providing OEM<br/>&gt; &gt; kits.
