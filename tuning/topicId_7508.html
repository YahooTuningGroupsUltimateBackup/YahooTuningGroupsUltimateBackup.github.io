Werckmeister meant<br/>&gt; the Pythagorean and not syntonic comma. So his fifth is tempered<br/>&gt; 1/4 Pyth. comma which is 5.865 cents, or 3.91 cents below ET fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>(Christopher Chapman:)<br/>&gt;Wim Hoogewerf wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;Korg gives:<br/>&gt;...<br/>&gt;&gt;C    .

Of course I thought about the Pythagorean<br/>comma. However, the book which provided my information should be<br/>trustworthy: Fundamentals of musical acoustics by Arthur H. Benade. In<br/>Chapter 16.3 he describes the actual tuning procedure for Werckmeister III,<br/>transmitted to him by Herman Greunke, an associate of the tracker-organ<br/>builder John Brombaugh. I quote: &#xFFFD;One begins the Werckmeister III tuning by<br/>setting the C4 reference note (...) and tuning E4 a perfect (zero-beat)<br/>major third above it. This E will serve as a temporary (later on the E will<br/>be tuned a perfect 5th on A, WH) check-point in setting the next part of the<br/>scale. Following this a series of four contracted 5ths are tuned (C to G, G<br/>to D, D to A, A to E), very much as in setting up an equally tempered scale,<br/>except that here one must shrink the tuning of each of the four intervals<br/>enough for the resulting E to be identical with the checkpoint E we have<br/>already set. Each member of this set has a frequency ratio of 1,4952 (5.5<br/>cents short),...&#xFFFD; (Unquote) That&#xFFFD;s definitely a syntonic comma and not a<br/>Pythagorean. I don&#xFFFD;t want to contest the *official* values of Werckmeister<br/>III. Korg gives them, Jean Lattard (Musique: Gammes et temp&#xFFFD;raments) and the<br/>New Groves as well (chapter on *Well-tempered clavier*) even if the<br/>description of the tuning is erroneous. &#xFFFD;For the first four perfect 5ths<br/>(C-G, G-D, D-A, B-F#) he used a tuning slightly tempered by a third of a<br/>comma, while the eight other  5ths remained pure&#xFFFD; (chapter on Andreas<br/>Werckmeister). At least Benade tells us how to tune to this temperament by<br/>ear. He doesn&apos;t mention that this is the equal-beating version.</p><p>(Christpher:)</p><p>&gt;BTW, Wim, what kind of fret tuning mechanism are you using?</p><p>The Vogt system with six moveable frets for each position.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div><h3><a id=7569 href="#7569">ðŸ”—</a>Wim Hoogewerf &#x3C;wim.hoogewerf@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2000 1:32:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Manuel, could you quote some german phrases from Werckmeister concerning his<br/>most famous temperament?</p><p>&gt; But because he prescribed 8 pure and 4 equally tempered fifths<br/>&gt; it&apos;s clearly the Pyth. comma.</p><p>Does he clearly say that all four fifths should be tempered in the same way<br/>or does he speak about beats (Schwebungen).
