The album&apos;s theme is microtonal with a beat.. Submission is open to all composers. I&apos;m interested in having a nice variety of different styles of music on the album, because that will be entertaining for us microheads and all the other listeners. If you&apos;d like to contribute to a project like this, please consider submitting some music. :)</p><p>You can find the vital info at: <a href="http://split-notes.com/compilation2010.php">http://split-notes.com/compilation2010.php</a></p><p>Thank you for reading!</p><p>Sean</p></div>
