But I agree that one needs many different angles, so one should<br/>&gt; be aware of some of the difficulties that come up when using Just Intonation<br/>&gt; for certain styles of music -- Blackwood&apos;s _Structure of Recognizable<br/>&gt; Diatonic Tunings_ nicely lays some of those out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>It rather looks to me like Paolo was giving up on the Doty as a<br/>&quot;starting place..&quot;  However, it seems you agree, Paul, that the Doty is<br/>INDEED a good place to start... of course reading the Helmholtz and<br/>Partch, too!  The Blackwood treatise might be a bit much for the<br/>absolute beginner, don&apos;t you think?  I found the mathematics rather<br/>arcane... although I realize with your own math background it probably<br/>isn&apos;t much of a problem...</p><p>_________ _____ __ __ _</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>pvallad1@tampabay.rr.com</h3><span>4/17/2000 8:24:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;It rather looks to me like Paolo was giving up on the Doty as a<br/>&gt;&quot;starting place..&quot;  However, it seems you agree, Paul, that the Doty is<br/>&gt;INDEED a good place to start... of course reading the Helmholtz and</p><p>A clarification here.
