Longer version:</p><p>Rothenberg assumes a process whereby a listener hears<br/>melodic intervals between sounds and sorts them by size.<br/>This produces an &quot;interval matrix&quot; (IM) in the listener&apos;s<br/>mind.  The listener continually refines this IM as stimuli<br/>arrive, and if a source is consistent for long enough he<br/>may remember its IM for later use.</p><p>The IM for a scale is simply a list of all its intervals<br/>(dyads) grouped by the modes in which they appear.  Scala<br/>will display it with &quot;show/line intervals&quot;.  Every fixed<br/>scale corresponds to one and only one IM.  So if we assume<br/>that listeners will eventually perfect their picture of<br/>a scale&apos;s IM, we can infer things about the scale from<br/>its IM.</p><p>Imagine a log-frequency ruler whose total length is the<br/>interval of equivalence of our periodic scale (e.g. 1200<br/>cents).  Mark off each interval in the IM on this ruler.<br/>Now we&apos;ll draw line segments on the ruler with colored<br/>pencil, using the marks as endpoints.  We&apos;ll connect all<br/>marks belonging to the same interval class with a single<br/>line, using a different color for each interval class.<br/>Lumma stability is the portion of the ruler that has no<br/>pencil on it.  The impropriety factor is the portion<br/>that&apos;s more than singly covered -- where different colors<br/>overlap.  The idea being that when two interval classes<br/>overlap, listeners will not be able to distinguish them<br/>in all cases.  Lumma stability measures how easily<br/>distinguishable the non-overlapping classes will be.</p><p>Rothenberg stability is very similar, except it counts<br/>the number of overlaps, so it can&apos;t distinguish a gross<br/>overlap (in cents) from a small one, or detect when two<br/>interval classes are arbitrarily close to overlapping.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2011 5:29:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In one sentence, Lumma stability is the portion of a<br/>&gt; scale&apos;s period which is not covered by its interval classes,<br/>&gt; and the &quot;Lumma impropriety factor&quot; is the portion which is<br/>&gt; more than singly-covered.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking of editing this article and sticking it on the Xenwiki, but I wonder if there might be a better starting point around.</p><p>By the way, someone needs to write an article on harmonic entropy.</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2011 9:11:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>Thanks for your response. This is great.</p><p>&gt; Did you see them in Scala&apos;s &quot;show data&quot; output?</p><p>Yes. As part of my slow-and-stubborn education, I&apos;m trying to learn what many of those things mean. I found some discussion on tuning-math from 5 years ago, but didn&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;. Your explanation here was much easier for me to digest.</p><p>Since recently I&apos;ve been focused on proper and strictly proper scales, I hadn&apos;t seen the Lumma impropriety factor, but I&apos;ve looked for it in improper scales, I see it now, too.</p><p>&gt; In one sentence, Lumma stability is the portion of a scale&apos;s period<br/>&gt; which is not covered by its interval classes</p><p>If I understand what follows, you mean that, say, the collection of one-step intervals in a scale (i.e., step 1 to 2, 18 to 19, and generally n to n-1) will have a certain variation, from (say) 60 cents to 70 cents, covering 10 cents. All of the two-step intervals will have a range as well, (say) 130 to 135 cents, covering 5 cents. And so on. If I add up to total of these distances and divide it by the period, I get the Lumma stability.</p><p>So, for instance, all EDOs will have a Lumma stability of 1, because the interval classes have no variation and are thus represented by points, which have size zero. Now that I think of it, all, and only, equal divisions of any period will have a Lumma stability of 1.</p><p>I would expect most regular- and well-temperaments to have a Lumma stability relatively close to 1. What does &quot;relatively close&quot; mean? In practice:<br/>* Werckmeister III = 0.86<br/>* Prinz = 0.84<br/>* pajara_mm.scl (Pajara minimax 22-tone scale from the Scala list) = 0.95<br/>* Meantone[12] = 0.70</p><p>The traditional 12-tET modes have a Lumma Stability of 0.5, and it looks like traditional diatonic modes of well-temperaments are around that, too.</p><p>12-tET harmonic minor, by gaining that 3-half-step interval, earns a Lumma Stability of 0.167. (It&apos;s still proper, though, so the Impropriety Factor is zero.) That appears to be pretty low. By comparison, Blackjack[21], which is not proper, has a Lumma Stability of 0.31 (and a Lumma Impropriety Factor of 0.14).</p><p>Generally speaking, improper scales seem to have relatively low Stability Factors, in the 0.3 range, sometimes going to 0.1 or lower.</p><p>&gt; and the &quot;Lumma impropriety factor&quot; is the portion which is<br/>&gt; more than singly-covered.</p><p>Only improper scales will have an impropriety factor (big surprise). It&apos;s not the inverse of the Lumma Stability Factor, though -- many improper scales (which will have a positive impropriety factor) will have a low but non-zero Stability Factor. You can have a low stability and a low impropriety, or a low stability and a high impropriety, but not a high stability and a high impropriety.</p><p>These seem like pretty useful measures. Melodically, I don&apos;t know that I want to have a stability too close to 1, but a scale with a stability of close to 1 might be good raw material from which I could make a mode, analogous to a major or minor mode, that gets me to a lower stability factor, closer to 0.5. Or not. Something to keep an eye on, anyway.</p><p>Thanks for the explanation.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2011 12:12:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m thinking of editing this article and sticking it on the<br/>&gt; Xenwiki,</p><p>Please do.</p><p>&gt; but I wonder if there might be a better starting point<br/>&gt; around.</p><p>I took this as a nudge to convert my FAQ draft to html with<br/>anchor links.

If 4 or 8 win, the brain is interpreting 10:12:15 literally, as a segment of harmonics relatively high in the series.  It is somewhat more likely that 5 or 10 will win; the brain hears 10:15 = 3:2 and dismisses 12 as an artifact.<br/>The above appears to concern how louder partials in timbre can make certain notes in a chord loud enough to &quot;mask&quot; other tones in the chord and shift the sense of the root tone, correct?</p><p>&gt;&quot;The same tradeoff exists in the case of 16:19:24, but here the literal interpretation is less likely because it relies on even higher harmonics.
