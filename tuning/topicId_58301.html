It includes 22 Bach<br/>selections.  Most of them are paired with the same sequence in another<br/>temperament, for direct comparison.<br/><a href="http://www.frogmusic.com/temperamentalcds.html">http://www.frogmusic.com/temperamentalcds.html</a></p><p>Recordings of additional repertoire are available at James Pressler&apos;s web<br/>site, &quot;Virtually Baroque&quot;. These other examples emphasize the Bach<br/>temperament&apos;s general utility as an all-purpose tuning.<br/><a href="http://www.virtuallybaroque.com/list5gac.htm">http://www.virtuallybaroque.com/list5gac.htm</a></p><p>=====</p><p>*** LaripS 1002 and 1003, performances by Bradley Lehman.

It demonstrates the<br/>new two-manual Taylor &amp; Boody Opus 41 at Goshen College, with representative music in all keys.<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tb41.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/tb41.html</a></p><p>The harpsichord set 1003 includes Bach sinfonias, preludes and fugues, and<br/>selections by other members of the Bach family.</p><p>=====</p><p>Information about this temperament:<br/><a href="http://www.larips.com/">http://www.larips.com/</a><br/>and in the February and May 2005 issues of _Early Music_, Oxford University<br/>Press.</p><p>Bradley Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=58305 href="#58305">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2005 2:31:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am pleased to announce several new recordings employing Bach&apos;s<br/>keyboard<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>Here&apos;s his article on the temperament:</p><p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/59spx">http://tinyurl.com/59spx</a></p><p>The gist of it is in the first sentence: that Bach actually wrote down<br/>a temperament with a circle of fifths consisting of five 1/6 comma<br/>fifths, three pure fifths, and three 1/12 comma fifths. However, Bach<br/>didn&apos;t actually write this down, but drew a diagram which needs<br/>interpreting. In any case, the given amount of tempering doesn&apos;t add<br/>up. However, Lehman gives an analysis in terms of tuning units, from<br/>which the temperament in his understanding of it can be reconstructed.<br/>In this, the fifths above F-A are lowered 120 tuning units, or 1/6<br/>Pythagoren comma, above C#, G# and Eb are lowered 60 tuning units, or<br/>1/12 comma, and above Bb is *raised* 60 tuning units, or 1/12 comma.<br/>This is now 5*(1/6)+2*(1/12)-1/12 = 11/12 Pythagorean commas of total<br/>tempering, or one syntonic comma. We still actually need a Pythagorean<br/>comma, not a syntonic comma, so it seems 60 TU really needs to be a<br/>little larger. If we take instead of 60 TU a value X=65 5/11 TU, then<br/>5*(2X) + 2*X - X = 11*X = 720 TU, or one Pythagorean comma.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s going on here, but I&apos;ll repeat my recommendation<br/>that the tuning unit be replaced with a system which divides the<br/>octave into 46032 equal parts, with the Pythagorean comma having 900<br/>parts and the syntonic comma 825 parts; the advantage of this is that<br/>we can represent all 5-limit intervals and are not stumbing about in<br/>the murk as to what, precisely, we are doing when it comes to the<br/>larger intervals. They are closely related to TUs, being 4/5 as large.</p></div><h3><a id=58310 href="#58310">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2005 3:06:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In this, the fifths above F-A are lowered 120 tuning units, or 1/6<br/>&gt; Pythagoren comma, above C#, G# and Eb are lowered 60 tuning units, or<br/>&gt; 1/12 comma, and above Bb is *raised* 60 tuning units, or 1/12 comma.<br/>&gt; This is now 5*(1/6)+2*(1/12)-1/12 = 11/12 Pythagorean commas of total<br/>&gt; tempering, or one syntonic comma.</p><p>Whups; I was staring at a table cross-eyed again. This should be<br/>*three* fifths flat by 1/12 Pythagorean comma, for a total of<br/>5*(1/6)+3*(1/12)-1/12 = 1 Pythagorean comma. Who cares what<br/>mathematicians think if they look at a table cross-eyed?</p></div>
