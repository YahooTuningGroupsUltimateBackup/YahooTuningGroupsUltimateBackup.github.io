But<br/>a simple modification would readily fix that without, I<br/>think, confusing it with any other symbol common in music:<br/>just stand it upright - the vertical bar or pipe symbol |<br/>has been standard on computer keyboards for decades<br/>now.</p><p>(I actually dislike using the dot, as it is so very small and<br/>easily lost, or read where one doesn&apos;t exist, particularly<br/>on old manuscripts.  That&apos;s why I prefer a dot somewhat<br/>larger than the full stop (period) we use in punctuation.<br/>Depending on the music font used, a small diamond dot is<br/>clearer and looks elegant.)</p><p>I think we need to be careful in choosing any new music<br/>notational symbol to avoid ones that are easily confused<br/>with existing musical symbols and signs.  For that reason<br/>alone, I don&apos;t think 0, &quot; or : are suitable for our zero.</p><p>We also want a mark that is quick to make - about as<br/>quick as the dot itself.  That&apos;s why a single stroke is<br/>probably better than a more complex shape like $.  The<br/>mark should also be small relative to the note head, and<br/>certainly no bigger than about half the space between<br/>lines of the staff - otherwise notating tone clusters<br/>would be too ambiguous.  There are four single strokes<br/>we can reliably produce and differentiate on a small<br/>scale - namely / \ | and -.  Of these, the dash - is too<br/>easily lost to view near a staff line, and more particularly<br/>near a leger line.  That leaves / \ and |.  I&apos;d settle for |<br/>as representing a clear &quot;break&quot; in a sequence of dots.</p><p>(Then we could reserve / and \ for other interesting<br/>possibilities - say for adding one or two thirds in a 3/3<br/>metre?  :-)  Just kidding (I think)! 0</p><p>Using o to stand for the crotchet (quarter-note)<br/>notehead, we&apos;d have:</p><p>1/4      = o<br/>17/64  = o|||.<br/>9/32    = o||.<br/>19/64  = o||..<br/>5/16     = o|.<br/>21/64   = o|.|.<br/>11/32   = o|..<br/>23/64   = o|...<br/>3/8       = o.<br/>25/64  = o.||.<br/>etc<br/> - - -<br/>31/64   = o....</p><p> - and not a tie in sight!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.12/77 - Release Date: 18/8/05</p></div>
