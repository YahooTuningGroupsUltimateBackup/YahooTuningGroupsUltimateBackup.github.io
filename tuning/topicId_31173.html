I will pass on the info to Mr. Gannon at Justonic.</p><p>The Justonic system was originally designed for musicians who wanted to<br/>adapt harmonic scales to a keyboard, so the algorithms are mapped to<br/>a twelve-tone keyboard, which has obvious practical value... BUT: because<br/>you can change scales instantly at any time... the choices of tones<br/>are unrestricted.</p><p>&gt;From any harmonic scale, the Justonic system creates a 3-dimensional<br/>array of tones based on an original tonic, a current tonal center,<br/>and the selected intervals. Therefore, any &quot;12-tone&quot; scale is actually<br/>made up of several hundred distinct tones in the full array (of 1728<br/>tones, including duplicates).</p><p>The software algorithm reads the chord structure at any given point<br/>in a live (or sequenced) performance, and retunes accordingly to keep<br/>everything harmonic. This may seem somewhat fixed, but you can<br/>override this choice manually. Furthermore, the actual choice of<br/>WHICH harmonic tone to use depends on how you define the scales.<br/>You may want a 5/3 sixth for one passage, and a flatter 25/16 sixth<br/>later, and a 1/4-tone flat 13/8 &quot;sixth&quot; etc. We&apos;ve used this<br/>successfully for playing Arabic pieces which may have 3 different<br/>&quot;sixths&quot; and three different &quot;thirds&quot; in one piece of music.</p><p>The system is based entirely on whole-number ratios, not cents, but<br/>there is a ratio-to-cents-to ratio calculator included.</p><p>The algorithm knows when you&apos;ve shifted harmonic centre, so it is<br/>fairly adaptive, but there may be scale choice decisions based on<br/>musical context that the Justonic system does not yet make. I&apos;d be<br/>interested in knowing of any such limitations in the system.</p><p>The algorithm will root a chord on its perceived tonic, but the player<br/>or composer can manually root a chord anywhere, on its third for example...<br/>or on any tone whether played or not played.</p><p>There are an infinite number of scale choices.</p><p>2. ... how did Jerry Eskelin get involved with this?</p><p>Gerald Eskelin contacted Bill Gannon several years ago, and they<br/>have been in some discussions about the Justonic system as<br/>it might apply to teaching a cappella singers.</p><p>Rex Weyler<br/><a href="mailto:rex@shared-vision.com">rex@shared-vision.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=31304 href="#31304">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 8:16:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Rex Weyler&quot; &lt;rex@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_31173.html#31273">/tuning/topicId_31173.html#31273</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: Rex Weyler<br/>&gt; RE: Questions about Justonic software<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you so much, Rex, for your response, and I should also add that<br/>the Justonic software is really pretty reasonably priced.</p><p>However, the person that you need to discuss this with is John<br/>deLaubenfels.

Always look forward to hear what you are doing. Despite the poetic gifts of<br/>those who have described it , it was a surprise and not quite what i had surmised .<br/>    It seems to me that a form of adaptive tuning is only feasible by electronics and therein<br/>lies  something for it to explore that acoustic instruments can do only by intuition and without<br/>the control one can do here. Systems with large number of tones  is another area feasible for<br/>those non acoustic instruments and always enjoy when people do the things i cannot do at all. In<br/>fact, it is what i wait for.<br/>    Sorry for the delay on feedback on this. downloading usually waits till late evening when such<br/>things are easier</p><p><a href="mailto:SETHARES@ECESERV0.ECE.WISC.EDU">SETHARES@ECESERV0.ECE.WISC.EDU</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/Local_Anomaly.mp3">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/Local_Anomaly.mp3</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=31314 href="#31314">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 10:42:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Rex Weyler&quot; &lt;rex@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: Rex Weyler<br/>&gt; RE: Questions about Justonic software</p><p>Hi Rex,</p><p>I&apos;ve asked these questions about Justonic before, and I&apos;ve gotten<br/>answers, but I&apos;d be curious to hear yours.</p><p>You&apos;re no doubt familiar with the problems of commatic pitch drift<br/>and commatic pitch shifts.</p><p>I wonder how you, as a musician using the Justonic software, if you<br/>were seeking to impart a feeling of contrapuntal melodic integrity<br/>while maintaining just harmony, would handle progressions like<br/>Benedetti&apos;s famous two?
