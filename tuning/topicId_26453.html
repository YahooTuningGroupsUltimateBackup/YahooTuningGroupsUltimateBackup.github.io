(I&apos;m in San Diego.)</p><p>&gt; Anyway what compiler are you using. Have you considered using<br/>&gt; codewarrior? I am more familiar with MSVC++ myself, but I hear<br/>&gt; many tout codewarrior as the way to go for cross platform<br/>&gt; applications. Might not be practical for you, of course,<br/>&gt; learning a different IDE, but I&apos;m just curious.</p><p>JustMusic already exists in MSVC++ (the oldest but most functional<br/>version), Visual Basic, and a very rudimentary new version in<br/>Borland C++ 4.02, which is the C++ compiler I have.  We&apos;ve tossed<br/>around quite a bit the idea of using Java.  I&apos;ll have to look<br/>into codewarrior... got any links?</p><p>BTW, the Visual Basic version was done soley for my benefit.<br/>I am less than a beginner at C++, but many of the other programmers<br/>in the JustMusic group are proficient C++&apos;ers.</p><p>I suggest that if you want to post more about JustMusic, you<br/>join that group now and post it there.</p><p>Good luck with your move, and enjoy the trip!  (My move west<br/>last year was a fantastic 3-week road trip in which I got to<br/>meet several list members and their families.)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
