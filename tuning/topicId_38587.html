I am willing to<br/>continue to discuss other aspects of the paper, but in the confusion over certain<br/>details I also feel that the central idea  in this section has been lost.</p><p>For this reason I will restate, in one sentence, the central point of that section<br/>(pages 161-171). And further, for Paul and others, I will add that I  believe that the<br/>simple, fundamental premise I challenge in this central point represents the most<br/>prominent and influential view, i.e. that it is the one expressed by some of the most<br/>well-known and influential practitioners and proponents of just intonation and<br/>other pure tuning methods. I ask that you read my words carefully, simply to avoid<br/>further uneccesary misunderstandings, and I will again do my best to ensure that<br/>my words are clear in their meaning!</p><p>First, a disclaimer: my paper and this discussion regard the contemporary JI<br/>movement, as it concerns the music of our time, and *not* theories of consonance<br/>and dissonance from 16th century Europe or ancient Greece, which apply to the<br/>music of another, specific time and context. (I have no problem with historical<br/>tunings, though they are not my area of interest.)</p><p>And now for the central point:<br/>The central point in pages 161-171 of my paper is that, according to the<br/>fundamental premise of contemporary just intonation, justly tuned intervals are<br/>more correct than non-just intervals, are what humans are meant to be hearing in<br/>their music, and that I believe this premise is false.</p><p>Please indulge me and reread that sentence.</p><p>If any of you feel motivated to respond to this simple, central point, please also<br/>consider a few other things before replying, as I have seen that it is necessary to<br/>make known the spirit in which I wrote the essay:</p><p>In the section of my essay in question I made criticisms of: first, the<br/>beating/overtones issue; second, the practical limitations composers would face *if<br/>they adhered strictly to the beating/overtones argument*; third, the very intense,<br/>polemical tone used by many prominent proponents, in which they attack Western<br/>music and pantonal music.</p><p>With regard to this first criticism of mine: I realize that I have cited only the most<br/>commonly and prominently stated arguments in support of pure tuning, regarding<br/>beating and the overtone series, and not other arguments which perhaps would<br/>make my presentation of just intonation logic more well-rounded, and which Paul<br/>would like very much for me to consider. (I intend to, at the soonest opportunity.)<br/>It is presumably for this reason that I have been called naive, profoundly lacking<br/>understanding, and so on, and for those of you who do cite other scientific<br/>arguments in support of this  fundamental premise of interval correctness, pages<br/>165 and most of page 166, in which I discuss only the overtones and beating issues,<br/>may seem frustrating. However I remain confident that I have thoroughly<br/>understood the basic premise (as I&apos;ve just stated it), and I believe that the<br/>paragraphs which follow (bottom page 166 and most of page 167), concerning<br/>musical context, cultural background and imagination not only are still pertinent,<br/>but in fact are the more important arguments. (I even wrote in the essay &quot;More<br/>importantly...&quot;)</p><p>If you do not adhere to the basic premise of just intonation I described above, that<br/>just intervals are &quot;what humans are meant to be hearing in their music,&quot; etc., but<br/>use JI for other reasons, then this part of my essay wasn&apos;t about you. I personally<br/>may not undestand why one would use JI if one doesn&apos;t believe in its basic premise,<br/>but that&apos;s none of my business. Composers, including myself, use all sorts of<br/>stimuli which may seem quirky to others, and it&apos;s a very personal issue - it&apos;s the<br/>final product of the music that most of us are waiting for.</p><p>And if you *do* adhere to that basic premise as far as it concerns your own music,<br/>but are not in the business of pushing these beliefs (which must apply to many of<br/>you), then it can get hairy (as it has), since you will probably wonder why I had to<br/>come out with these statement. Most likely if arguments hadn&apos;t been so frequently<br/>and forcefully made from JI proponents so prominent and influential that they<br/>could be considered spokespeople of the movement (I don&apos;t wish to name names<br/>here, but I have cited some of them in the essay, and there are others), I probably<br/>wouldn&apos;t have felt the need to expend so much effort criticizing even the theoretical<br/>premise, let alone the political arguments, and would have written more of a<br/>simple, opinionless introduction to Part 2, as Joe Pehrson and others wish I had. In<br/>other words, I generally don&apos;t care if people privately believe this or anything else<br/>I consider false, as long as they aren&apos;t making damaging and influential claims.</p><p>Why do I consider such claims damaging? As I indicated in the essay, I feel that<br/>attempting to devalue the music of several generations of composers and<br/>improvisors based on ostensible (or, for that matter, real) scientific evidence is a<br/>hateful act, one with a sizeable and willing audience today. Further, I believe that<br/>musicians ought to be left to find the appropriate materials for their art on their<br/>own, based on their cultural background, their chosen musical influences, and their<br/>imagination. (The last two especially could include the use of just intonation, of<br/>course.) And further, I believe that the basic premise of JI, stated above, when<br/>applied inappropriately beyond one&apos;s own private compositional method, is at odds<br/>with and implicity devalues most jazz, popular, non-Western and folk music which<br/>is *not* purely tuned, while at the same time many of its proponents claim to ally<br/>themselves with these types of music.</p><p>-Julia</p></div><h3><a id=38590 href="#38590">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2002 6:50:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The central point in pages 161-171 of my paper is that, according to the<br/>&gt; fundamental premise of contemporary just intonation, justly tuned intervals are<br/>&gt; more correct than non-just intervals, are what humans are meant to be hearing in<br/>&gt; their music, and that I believe this premise is false.</p><p>This says that the &quot;fundamental principle&quot; of contemporary just intonation is a judgment of value.

But you may be interested to know that it could hardly<br/>have been<br/>&gt; worse for Joe Maneri at the New England Conservatory (microtonal<br/>course<br/>&gt; notwithstanding) in terms of acceptance and recognition, and that<br/>for most of my<br/>&gt; time at Brandeis, up until hip David Rakowski arrived on the<br/>faculty and agreed to<br/>&gt; advise me on my thesis, it is no exaggeration to say that I was<br/>laughed at and<br/>&gt; publicly humiliated for composing with microtones and presenting<br/>microtonal<br/>&gt; works in analysis class, and was even told not to compose with<br/>microtones as long<br/>&gt; as I was there! (By the time I left, I think I may have softened<br/>some of them, but<br/>&gt; not without much bitter heartache.) In addition, I have been<br/>rejected repeatedly<br/>&gt; from certain &quot;establishment&quot; conferences and competitions,<br/>specifically for<br/>&gt; submitting microtonal works. In fact, I have sometimes felt that<br/>Joe Maneri and I<br/>&gt; and his other students who study microtones don&apos;t fit in anywhere<br/>as<br/>&gt; microtonalists, other than in our own &quot;scene&quot; here in Boston. ...</p><p>From this I can safely conclude that Julia&apos;s experience on the Tuning<br/>List is not the worst thing that she has had to endure in her pursuit<br/>of microtonality.

(I even wrote in the<br/>essay &quot;More<br/>&gt; importantly...&quot;)</p><p>well, i myself have been critical of some just intonation theory on<br/>some similar grounds (i&apos;ve brought up the Ab to B example more than<br/>my share of times). but i do believe that psychoacoustics and human<br/>neurology will always play a *partial* role in how music is heard,<br/>particularly in establishing the &quot;patterns&quot; (if not always<br/>the &quot;exceptions&quot;) of which sonorities (even if concentrating solely<br/>on extremely unfamiliar ones) possess more latent discordance and<br/>which possess less -- and thus, when these are taken in combination<br/>with *other* human perceptual/psychological considerations such as<br/>categorical perception, what types of consonance/dissonance grammars<br/>may be feasibly communicated to listeners. whether or not this is<br/>actually true, the issue of &quot;correctness&quot; is quite another one<br/>entirely . . .</p><p>the &quot;imagination&quot; argument doesn&apos;t fly as far as i&apos;m concerned.<br/>unless one is living in a solipsistic musical world, one has to get<br/>one&apos;s musical ideas across to a listener. in order to do so, one can<br/>either rely on extra-musical communication, or else one *has* to<br/>appeal to either culturally or biologically common features in the<br/>listening minds of the composer and the listener. if not,<br/>then &quot;imagined&quot; meanings such as those of &quot;solidity&quot; will have no<br/>meaning outside the imagination of the composer.</p><p>the middle paragraph on page 167 again invokes the &quot;straw man&quot;:</p><p>&quot;. . . it would obviously be futile, even absurd, to try to avoid the<br/>feared &apos;incorrectness&apos; of this majority of relationships by<br/>restricting oneself to simple pure triads or seventh chords in one&apos;s<br/>music&quot;</p><p>which is not an argument against any contemporary just intonationist<br/>i can think of; and moreover, even restricting oneself in such a<br/>manner does not imply any restrictions whatsoever on the melodic<br/>intervals that may occur (q.v. the blackjack example again). since<br/>melodic intervals are the primary focus of the second part of your<br/>paper, there really seems to be a huge gap between the first part and<br/>the second part, such that one wonders what they&apos;re doing in the same<br/>paper.</p><p>&gt; If you do not adhere to the basic premise of just intonation I<br/>described above, that<br/>&gt; just intervals are &quot;what humans are meant to be hearing in their<br/>music,&quot; etc., but<br/>&gt; use JI for other reasons, then this part of my essay wasn&apos;t about<br/>you.</p><p>well, ok, but i might say some similar things -- for example, any<br/>vertical interval (except perhaps the perfect consonances) will be,<br/>in some respects, processed by the human perceptual apparatus with a<br/>degree of uncertainty, with simultaneous conflicting interpretations<br/>in terms of several *just intervals*. my own model of a component of<br/>latent discordance (which is not a yes/no proposition but rather a<br/>continuous quantity), that i call harmonic entropy, is simply a<br/>measure of this uncertainty. whether this model is well-founded or<br/>not (i of course believe it is), it certainly agrees with perceptual<br/>qualities i am aware of when listening to various intervals out of<br/>musical context. now of course musical context has a huge effect on<br/>how they&apos;re perceived, but it can never, say, turn these qualities<br/>upside-down, such that all of the concordances sound dissonant and<br/>all of the discordances sound consonant. sure, one can make<br/>concordances sound &quot;jarring&quot; and out-of-place in a context where<br/>dissonance is expected, but this only serves to demonstrate that<br/>there&apos;s a universally perceived difference in quality between the<br/>extremes of these categories. open fifths and octaves can<br/>sound &quot;incorrect&quot; when approched in parallel motion in some styles;<br/>this in no way negates the fact that the perception of these<br/>intervals involves less neurological uncertainty than the perception<br/>of the &quot;richer&quot; intervals of tonal music -- it&apos;s just that the sudden<br/>reduction of uncertainty is damaging to the musical texture. so here,<br/>i find myself in agreement with you that it&apos;s absurd to<br/>associate &quot;correctness&quot; with a maximization of the prevalence of the<br/>simplest possible ratios in music. but who does? name one person<br/>whose statements solidly match such a point of view.</p><p>if taken to its extreme, this &quot;just intonation&quot; view would allow only<br/>the very simplest and least ambiguous interval, the 1/1, to ever<br/>occur as a verticality in music (while of course saying nothing about<br/>disallowing any conceivable melodic/horizontal intervals). and where<br/>can one find examples of such an aesthetic? ironically enough, in the<br/>second part of your paper!</p><p>&gt; I personally<br/>&gt; may not undestand why one would use JI if one doesn&apos;t believe in<br/>its basic premise,<br/>&gt; but that&apos;s none of my business.</p><p>then why claim that some just intonation composers, any in fact that<br/>use &quot;interesting&quot; (for you) sonorities or intervals, are violating<br/>the basic premise of just intonation? without providing a single<br/>example of a composer who writes music consistent with the basic<br/>premise of just intonation as you see it? if you truly felt that it&apos;s<br/>none of your business, you wouldn&apos;t have made this claim. since<br/>you&apos;ve made it your business, you&apos;d be well served to better<br/>understand what premises these (in fact virtually all contemporary<br/>just intonation) composers in fact rely on. did you run your &quot;taken<br/>fundamental liberties with the just intonation model&quot; claim by any of<br/>the composers you accuse of doing so, to see how they would respond,<br/>before putting such a statement in print? i doubt it -- either way,<br/>it&apos;s now irrevocably &quot;your business&quot;!</p><p>&gt; Most likely if arguments hadn&apos;t been so frequently<br/>&gt; and forcefully made from JI proponents so prominent and influential<br/>that they<br/>&gt; could be considered spokespeople of the movement (I don&apos;t wish to<br/>name names<br/>&gt; here, but I have cited some of them in the essay, and there are<br/>others),</p><p>i&apos;ve already dealt with the cases of david doty and kyle gann (in my<br/>post entitled &quot;straw man&quot;, and david spoke for himself as well (in<br/>his post he pleasantly suprised me by not even advocating just<br/>intonation for the tuning of dissonances, and of course was as<br/>accepting of the *presence* of dissonances as i had said he was in<br/>the _primer_). i await your reply. so far, i fail to see any evidence<br/>that your &quot;straw man&quot; exists.</p></div><h3><a id=38632 href="#38632">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2002 12:36:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>gdsecor wrote:</p><p>I use the term &quot;friends&quot; because I believe that we all need to<br/>remember that we share a common bond in our desire that microtonality<br/>may one day be appreciated by a larger audience and that we all need<br/>to help one another in our efforts to make that a reality.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>I&apos;ll second that.</p><p>Best wishes</p></div><h3><a id=39721 href="#39721">ðŸ”—</a>jwerntz2002 &#x3C;juliawerntz@attbi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2002 8:32:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>the *only* issue should be the *absurdity* of such an<br/>&gt; objective measure of &quot;correctness&quot; in art. this could be demonstrated<br/>&gt; with one or a few examples from established musical styles from<br/>&gt; around the world where musical &quot;correctness&quot; is well-defined and<br/>&gt; agreed upon by a body of musicians and listeners. that&apos;s it, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; all you need to discuss. the rest is superfluous.</p><p>It&apos;s all Paul Erlich would need to discuss.

Of course, if it was the only factor there could<br/>hardly be any musical communication, ever. But I never implied this.</p><p>&gt; the middle paragraph on page 167 again invokes the &quot;straw man&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;. . . it would obviously be futile, even absurd, to try to avoid the<br/>&gt; feared &apos;incorrectness&apos; of this majority of relationships by<br/>&gt; restricting oneself to simple pure triads or seventh chords in one&apos;s<br/>&gt; music&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which is not an argument against any contemporary just intonationist<br/>&gt; i can think of; and moreover, even restricting oneself in such a<br/>&gt; manner does not imply any restrictions whatsoever on the melodic<br/>&gt; intervals that may occur (q.v. the blackjack example again). since<br/>&gt; melodic intervals are the primary focus of the second part of your<br/>&gt; paper, there really seems to be a huge gap between the first part and<br/>&gt; the second part, such that one wonders what they&apos;re doing in the same<br/>&gt; paper.</p><p>I see no connection (nor lack of connectedness) between these two things. It seems<br/>like a big leap you are making. The second part of my paper is about composing<br/>with microtones entirely independently of just intonation concerns, so why would JI<br/>restrictions or lack-of-them-in-melodic-intervals  be relevent there?</p><p> sure, one can make<br/>&gt; concordances sound &quot;jarring&quot; and out-of-place in a context where<br/>&gt; dissonance is expected, but this only serves to demonstrate that<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a universally perceived difference in quality between the<br/>&gt; extremes of these categories.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe any dissonance is expected in the Bartok example I gave. (But try<br/>Mikrokosmos no. 65 from the same book, Vol. II, for another, maybe even better<br/>example of this, with harsh, rough, jarring open fifths and no harmonic<br/>expectations of any kind.) And fifths or octaves can sound &quot;jarring&quot; if you just sit<br/>and pound a bunch of them out violently on the piano, for that matter. So musical<br/>context can include, aside from voice-leading and harmonic &quot;expectations,&quot;<br/>something as simple as dynamics and articulation. If there is something that is pure<br/>and perfect about the octave, well this is easily achievable, but it does depend on<br/>how this octave is treated by the composer. If someone hammers it away<br/>ruthlessly at a fortississimo dynamic, then that all of that purity or stability is going<br/>to go out the window.</p><p>Maybe it seems like I am confusing issues now, confusing functional harmonic<br/>stability with the effects of dynamics and articulation. But this is exactly my point,<br/>that  psychoacoustic arguments about harmony that are *qualitative* (simple<br/>ratios=correct, irrational intervals=mistake) cannot lead us into the music itself<br/>when they ignore the immeasurable influence of so many other factors. And<br/>because of this I remain highly sceptical of the value - beyond its idiosyncratic<br/>application to the work of any one individual and his/her art - of any tuning dogma,<br/>*in our day and age*.</p><p>Gann writes that a 680-cent fifth sounds &quot;scary.&quot; *Any* fifth can sound scary, or it<br/>can sound ethereal, depending on what you do with it. Give me any interval and I&apos;ll<br/>make it pretty, or I&apos;ll make it scary (of course, these characterizations are matters<br/>of opinion...). This is not the same thing as saying that all intervals are the same,<br/>it&apos;s just pointing out that all intervals are potential materials with which to create a<br/>huge variety of kinds of great music. This seems so painfully obvious, in fact.</p><p>open fifths and octaves can<br/>&gt; sound &quot;incorrect&quot; when approched in parallel motion in some styles;<br/>&gt; this in no way negates the fact that the perception of these<br/>&gt; intervals involves less neurological uncertainty than the perception<br/>&gt; of the &quot;richer&quot; intervals of tonal music -- it&apos;s just that the sudden<br/>&gt; reduction of uncertainty is damaging to the musical texture.</p><p>I&apos;d be curious to get a reading of someone&apos;s &quot;neurological uncertainty&quot; with my<br/>pounding octaves out on the piano at triple forte example. But I&apos;m sure I sound<br/>very crude.</p><p>so here,<br/>&gt; i find myself in agreement with you that it&apos;s absurd to<br/>&gt; associate &quot;correctness&quot; with a maximization of the prevalence of the<br/>&gt; simplest possible ratios in music. but who does? name one person<br/>&gt; whose statements solidly match such a point of view.</p><p>We&apos;re just talking about octaves (I used octaves and fifths in the paper as an<br/>example) because the octave would represent the most perfect harmonic structure<br/>according to the premise and the underlying logic of just intonation. (Actually,<br/>according to Partch, maybe it would be the unison?) Anyway, I never claimed that<br/>the JI composers I cited in the essay maximize the octave in their music. Though I<br/>have heard plenty of JI music that seems to be &quot;maximizing&quot; partials 1-7 or 1-9. I<br/>don&apos;t want to get into that, though.</p><p>(BTW, Here&apos;s your one person: David Doty, again, since I have his website handy.<br/>&quot;Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the intervals can be<br/>represented by ratios of whole numbers, with a strongly-implied preference for the<br/>smallest numbers compatible with a given musical purpose.&quot; This is the first<br/>statement in his definition of JI from his primer. And, further down: &quot;The<br/>simple-ratio intervals upon which Just Intonation is based ...are what the human<br/>auditory system recognizes as consonance, if it ever has the opportunity to hear<br/>them in a musical context.&quot; I&apos;m just sitting at my computer right at this moment; it<br/>probably wouldn&apos;t be too hard to find more.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; if taken to its extreme, this &quot;just intonation&quot; view would allow only<br/>&gt; the very simplest and least ambiguous interval, the 1/1, to ever<br/>&gt; occur as a verticality in music (while of course saying nothing about<br/>&gt; disallowing any conceivable melodic/horizontal intervals). and where<br/>&gt; can one find examples of such an aesthetic? ironically enough, in the<br/>&gt; second part of your paper!<br/>&gt;</p><p>You&apos;re definitely going to need to explain that one.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I personally<br/>&gt; &gt; may not undestand why one would use JI if one doesn&apos;t believe in<br/>&gt; its basic premise,<br/>&gt; &gt; but that&apos;s none of my business.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; then why claim that some just intonation composers, any in fact that<br/>&gt; use &quot;interesting&quot; (for you) sonorities or intervals, are violating<br/>&gt; the basic premise of just intonation? without providing a single<br/>&gt; example of a composer who writes music consistent with the basic<br/>&gt; premise of just intonation as you see it? if you truly felt that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; none of your business, you wouldn&apos;t have made this claim.</p><p>You&apos;re mixing up issues. I didn&apos;t claim in my paper that Sims, Stahnke, Johnston<br/>and Harrison don&apos;t *believe* in the basic premise of JI. I *did* claim that these<br/>four composers seem, in certain pieces, to be &quot;taking fundamental liberties with<br/>the just intonation model, admittedly or not,&quot; and that is a different thing. I<br/>suppose one could say that if a composer *intentionally* takes liberties with the JI<br/>model, as Stahnke has done in pieces like &quot;Partch Harp,&quot; in which he juxtaposes<br/>two conflicting just tunings, that this seems to imply he/she must not believe in its<br/>basic premise. But that would be jumping to conclusions.</p><p>Notice, too, the difference between my &quot;taking liberties&quot; language and your<br/>&quot;violating&quot; memory of what I wrote. Taking liberties is what real artists often need<br/>to do, in my opinion.</p><p> did you run your &quot;taken<br/>&gt; fundamental liberties with the just intonation model&quot; claim by any of<br/>&gt; the composers you accuse of doing so, to see how they would respond,<br/>&gt; before putting such a statement in print? i doubt it -- either way,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s now irrevocably &quot;your business&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>I accused no one. I would never &quot;accuse&quot; a composer of something he/she had<br/>composed. I do make the claim you&apos;ve quoted, but there was no  accusatory tone.<br/>In fact, the main purpose of the section you are referring to (p170-171) was to<br/>praise the some of the music of these four people and to admit that some good<br/>music has come out if it, despite the theory (as well as to conclude by stating once<br/>again my belief that one could just as well get the funky intervals directly, without<br/>all the theory). I don&apos;t believe I needed their permission to write this, as it is<br/>understood clearly to be *my* view of things.</p><p>But for that matter, since you ask, I *have* consulted with Stahnke personally<br/>about this very issue. And I knew that Ezra (a friend) would hate what I wrote<br/>there. On the other hand, he already knows my views; he knows that I don&apos;t share<br/>his theory but do admire his music.</p></div><h3><a id=39726 href="#39726">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2002 11:05:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  No, you just need to tell me *what* false conclusions from<br/>Helmholtz I am<br/>&gt; drawing in my essay.

I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want to get into that, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (BTW, Here&apos;s your one person: David Doty, again, since I have his website handy.<br/>&gt; &quot;Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the intervals can be<br/>&gt; represented by ratios of whole numbers, with a strongly-implied preference for the<br/>&gt; smallest numbers compatible with a given musical purpose.&quot; This is the first<br/>&gt; statement in his definition of JI from his primer. And, further down: &quot;The<br/>&gt; simple-ratio intervals upon which Just Intonation is based ...are what the human<br/>&gt; auditory system recognizes as consonance, if it ever has the opportunity to hear<br/>&gt; them in a musical context.&quot; I&apos;m just sitting at my computer right at this moment; it<br/>&gt; probably wouldn&apos;t be too hard to find more.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Thank you for your lucid remarks.</p><p>What is the URL for David Doty&apos;s website?</p><p>Also, if you play a C octave as &quot;the most perfect harmonic structure&quot; as you say<br/>&quot;of just intonation,&quot; at least in that scale, would adding an F note in that octave,<br/>as you play it, form for you, a consonant or dissonant chord?  And what do you call the F<br/>note relative to the C octave, as described?  Would you call it a harmonic chord?</p><p>Thank you for your lucid remarks.</p><p>And thanks, in advance,</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Faith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos &amp; More<br/><a href="http://faith.yahoo.com">http://faith.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39733 href="#39733">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2002 7:07:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Bill Arnold&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; What is the URL for David Doty&apos;s website?</p><p><a href="http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/">http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/</a></p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div><h3><a id=39815 href="#39815">ðŸ”—</a>jwerntz2002 &#x3C;juliawerntz@attbi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2002 11:21:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; (BTW, Here&apos;s your one person: David Doty, again, since I have his<br/>&gt; website handy.<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the<br/>&gt; intervals can be<br/>&gt; &gt; represented by ratios of whole numbers, with a strongly-implied<br/>&gt; preference for the<br/>&gt; &gt; smallest numbers compatible with a given musical purpose.&quot; This is<br/>&gt; the first<br/>&gt; &gt; statement in his definition of JI from his primer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yup, it&apos;s the *definition* for this particular system of *tuning*.<br/>&gt; you can approximate any conceivable interval, i.e. fulfill any &quot;given<br/>&gt; musical purpose&quot;, from the most consonant to the most dissonant, with<br/>&gt; an infinitude of different ratios. if you&apos;re a &quot;just intonationist&quot;<br/>&gt; in doty&apos;s sense, you&apos;ll choose with a strong preference for the<br/>&gt; simpler of those ratios. so for a sharp dissonance of 63 cents, you&apos;d<br/>&gt; often choose to use 27:28 in this circumstance. it might fit better<br/>&gt; with some other beatless intervals hanging about in the music, or it<br/>&gt; might just be a matter of occult tradition -- either way, it would<br/>&gt; accord with &quot;just intonation&quot; tuning principles.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok, so this statement of doty&apos;s, is it problematical in some way?<br/>&gt; sorry, i&apos;ve again lost the train . . .</p><p>It&apos;s just that you had asked me to &quot;name one person whose statements solidly<br/>match such a point of view&quot; (a view in which &quot;correctness&quot; was associated with<br/>maximazation of the simplest ratios in music).

Here some of the intervals differ by about<br/>a quartertone from those of a conventional Western European tuning<br/>during the medieval-Romantic eras.</p><p>Here I&apos;ve picked relatively small ratios, since there&apos;s a standing<br/>debate on the question of whether more complex ratios, in many<br/>settings, have a distinctively &quot;just&quot; quality -- although I use them<br/>with great relish.</p><p>Recently I posted an article about the &quot;ratio space&quot; of the Peppermint<br/>24 tuning system for two 12-note keyboards -- not JI, but with lots of<br/>intervals within about 2-3 cents of just -- to suggest the novelty and<br/>variety available.</p><p>The system is based on ratios of 2-3-7-9-11-13, with 14:17:21 also<br/>closely approximated -- in contrast to the conventional 5-limit or<br/>7-limit harmony that often tends to get assumed in &quot;JI&quot; discussions.</p><p>Julia, I agree with you that lots of the creative possibilities of<br/>this kind of just or &quot;close to just&quot; intonation are also present in<br/>other kinds of systems.</p><p>Thus I would see just or close to just intonation as one strategy for<br/>getting &quot;novelty and diversity&quot; -- with the choice of general<br/>categories of intervals often as important as the exact tuning.</p><p>From one perspective, I might consider integer ratios as &quot;found<br/>numbers&quot; than can be used in a musical composition -- not _the_<br/>approach to beautiful music, but simply one alternative, itself with<br/>many branches.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=40153 href="#40153">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2002 6:36:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hello Paul/Julia</p><p>&gt; I am not sure where the idea of &quot;culture &quot; got into this but i can&apos;t at the moment figure out what it is in relation to the activity of making music. Surely the old structures have all but crumbled and we all and we are each left whistling our tunes which comes out of us from who knows where. I think this discussion also touches upon the person who states that 12 ET<br/>&gt; is the best tuning.</p><p>Any argument as to what is the more correct scale or method must first prove that such a thing or idea can be possible, FIRST<br/> before the music exist.</p><p>Much too much time is wasted on the assumption that this argument is valid. If valid it needs to be proved.<br/>Our species progresses by tool malking for a large part and yet no one would argue that one paticular tool is the best.<br/> Or imagine someone picking 12 or 72 colors and saying everything can be done with this.<br/>Whty shall we assume it is possible with music making music alone as being different from all other arts.</p><p>Since we are each dealing with &quot;ideals&quot; according to our own muse. Reason is useful in solving our special callings but not equipped to solve universalites among the myriad of these subjective experiences.</p><p>The highly developed different music (  very little of it primitive being the result of sometimes thousand of years) that occurs on our planet is quite different and shows little that is universal. Possibly melody and rhythm are the most common (I CAN think of possible exceptions to both) . please correct me if you can think of more.<br/>Being the case, if we except these different musics as not &quot;mistakes&quot; we must conclude that there is no musical scale universally correct a priori to the the act of music making.</p><p>    Actually the one category i can add to the above but of a different case is that music is based on acoustical phenomenon. Just intonation being just one type, highly perceptable in its learning curve, yet not the only one. More investigation is necessary into looking at just what is is that people are hearing and listening to when they make their music. These foci<br/>of attention, as far as i can tell is responsible for the resultant structures we call scales.

The reason for this is<br/>that different music often requires a different Foci of attention as to what the listener is to listen to. There is not a<br/>tuning method to come up with the solutions to ALL problems. 72 ET would be absurd to the Tibetan Monks just as there low<br/>cluster would be useless for your own musical course. I wdo believe that music is based on varied acoustical phenomenon and<br/>to venture outside of them runs the risk of unperceptability.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:juliawerntz@attbi.com">juliawerntz@attbi.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Kraig.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s hard for me to follow much of what you&apos;re saying here, but it seems you think I<br/>&gt; (or Paul?) was saying that there is one kind of correct or best tuning? Speaking for<br/>&gt; myself, I can just say this never happened.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to know more about the &quot;culture&quot; discussion we were having, just<br/>&gt; follow the thread backwards, I guess.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Julia<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Paul/Julia<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure where the idea of &quot;culture &quot; got into this but i can&apos;t at the<br/>&gt; moment figure out what it is in relation to the activity of making music. Surely the<br/>&gt; old structures have all but crumbled and we all and we are each left whistling our<br/>&gt; tunes which comes out of us from who knows where. I think this discussion also<br/>&gt; touches upon the person who states that 12 ET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is the best tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Any argument as to what is the more correct scale or method must first prove<br/>&gt; that such a thing or idea can be possible, FIRST<br/>&gt; &gt;  before the music exist.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Much too much time is wasted on the assumption that this argument is valid. If<br/>&gt; valid it needs to be proved.<br/>&gt; &gt; Our species progresses by tool malking for a large part and yet no one would<br/>&gt; argue that one paticular tool is the best.<br/>&gt; &gt;  Or imagine someone picking 12 or 72 colors and saying everything can be done<br/>&gt; with this.<br/>&gt; &gt; Whty shall we assume it is possible with music making music alone as being<br/>&gt; different from all other arts.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since we are each dealing with &quot;ideals&quot; according to our own muse. Reason is<br/>&gt; useful in solving our special callings but not equipped to solve universalites among<br/>&gt; the myriad of these subjective experiences.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The highly developed different music (  very little of it primitive being the result<br/>&gt; of sometimes thousand of years) that occurs on our planet is quite different and<br/>&gt; shows little that is universal. Possibly melody and rhythm are the most common (I<br/>&gt; CAN think of possible exceptions to both) . please correct me if you can think of<br/>&gt; more.<br/>&gt; &gt; Being the case, if we except these different musics as not &quot;mistakes&quot; we must<br/>&gt; conclude that there is no musical scale universally correct a priori to the the act of<br/>&gt; music making.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     Actually the one category i can add to the above but of a different case is that<br/>&gt; music is based on acoustical phenomenon. Just intonation being just one type,<br/>&gt; highly perceptable in its learning curve, yet not the only one. More investigation is<br/>&gt; necessary into looking at just what is is that people are hearing and listening to<br/>&gt; when they make their music. These foci<br/>&gt; &gt; of attention, as far as i can tell is responsible for the resultant structures we call<br/>&gt; scales. Each perfect for the phenomenon they address.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We need to move from right or wrong to possibly a state of a mutual helping<br/>&gt; solve each others musical visions.
