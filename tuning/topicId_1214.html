Bela Fleck and the Flecktones<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In what sense is this a rock group? Top-of-the-line, yes; popular, very;<br/>&gt;rock, I think not.</p><p>Bass, drums, and they play at rock-type shows, opening for the likes of<br/>Dave Matthews.  Enough for me.  Graham Breed and I recently had a bout<br/>about music classification, and instead of going thru it again, I&apos;ll say<br/>that I may have a broader definition of rock than most.</p><p>&gt;&gt;2. Ozric Tentacles<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They don&apos;t _suck_, but I sure get tired of them very quickly.</p><p>I&apos;m new on them (Pungent Effulgent and Erpland), but there is some rhythmic<br/>innovation going on.  And, at the very least, they prove stunning<br/>virtuosity, with their instruments, and with their sound.</p><p>&gt;Do you think Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood is a rock group? They&apos;re really good<br/>&gt;too (my friend Bob Moses was their teacher!)</p><p>It&apos;s funny, they were the only other group I almost added.  I haven&apos;t done<br/>a lot of listening to them, but my initial reaction is to put them on just<br/>the next level down from these three.  Yes, I consider them a rock group.<br/>Most of the people I know that listen to them listen to rock and rap.  Bob<br/>Moses- Cool!</p><p>&gt;&gt;3. Phish<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They push the envelope _and_ bring it home! Probably more people have<br/>&gt;heard 20th-century techniques because of Phish than through the efforts<br/>&gt;of any other musician or group (including Boulez). Don&apos;t buy a CD -- see<br/>&gt;them live.</p><p>I&apos;ve never been to a show, but I certainly have made a study of their<br/>albums.  I also followed that chess game they played with the audience.  I<br/>was telling Graham Breed, who had never heard of them, that as far as I<br/>know they are the most popular band since 1980 never to appear on MTV.</p><p>&gt;Any of these three groups would no doubt make marvelous use of<br/>&gt;microtonal scales.</p><p>Ozric, in particular, is just begging for them.  I read an interview with<br/>Ed Wynne, and he discussed his use of using strange (12tET) scales and<br/>bending notes.  He actually mentioned Steve Vai&apos;s use of microtones, but<br/>said that he wouldn&apos;t go that far because it seemed to him that it would be<br/>out of tune with regular music.  How&apos;s that for justice?</p><p>Phish has some of the most brilliant vocals around (I submit that JI is the<br/>best model for them).  They&apos;ve also done interesting things like purposely<br/>singing flat (Hoist).</p><p>Carl</p></div>
