This is a very valuable tool for the study of scales, and<br/>there is also a scale *archive.*</p><p>The new version of SCALA also has MIDI capabilities with your sound<br/>card, so you can hear the sounds right away.</p><p>It&apos;s also possible, using SCALA, to make MIDI files that can retune<br/>synths, such as the inexpensive ($150) TX81Z which is a wonderful, if<br/>a little dated, utility for tuning.  They can be found used all over<br/>the place.</p><p>Some of the work that *I* personally did using this instrument, and<br/>wonderful pieces by many people who frequent this forum, can be found<br/>on the Tuning Punks:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html</a></p><p>Another great tool, is the *Fractal Tune Smithy* which is a utility<br/>developed by *another* one of our great list frequenters, Robert<br/>Walker.  (We have a bunch of mighty talented people around here!)</p><p>Robert&apos;s utility is not freeware, but it&apos;s *almost* free... I think<br/>around $25 or such.  It plays a myriad of scales, can play and<br/>manipulate SCALA files, and can also be directed to drive other<br/>synths, as I understand it.  (I haven&apos;t worked with it yet in this<br/>way...)</p><p>It&apos;s another great, cheap tool you should have:</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/">http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/</a></p><p>Soon you will meet all kinds of amazing people here, and there are<br/>too many to mention by name... but they will surface, as soon as they<br/>get finished sunbathing.</p><p>best to you and good luck!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=38839 href="#38839">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2002 8:12:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Marc!</p><p>You&apos;ve already had some good suggestions on the list, especially some of the advice from Joe P.

There are many &quot;rediscoveries,&quot; sometimes taking<br/>on different colors and flavors because approach the same sonorities<br/>from a range of stylistic viewpoints.</p><p>One nice starting point for someone just coming into this xenharmonic<br/>area might be to try your just intonation sampler and to tune a<br/>synthesizer or sound card with a MIDI keyboard using a program like<br/>Scala, which can support a vast range of just and tempered tunings<br/>alike, including the archive of scales available to go with it.</p><p>My own approach is to use a Yamaha TX-802 synthesizer with two regular<br/>MIDI keyboards of four octaves each. This makes possible tunings of up<br/>to 24 notes per octave with a usual arrangement of octaves on each<br/>keyboard. Often 24-note tunings are my favorite, with identical<br/>patterns of steps and intervals on each of the two keyboards, with a<br/>certain convenient distance between the keyboards.</p><p>For the styles of music I often practice, having regular fifths and<br/>fourths on each keyboard in the usual places can make things simpler;<br/>mixing notes and intervals from the two keyboards brings about new<br/>sonorities.</p><p>While going beyond 12 notes per octave opens extra possibilities, I&apos;d<br/>want to stress that basic 12-note tunings have an immense variety to<br/>offer in themselves: the Scala archive has lots of examples.</p><p>Interestingly, there are at least a couple of different ways to start<br/>out in exploring these tunings.</p><p>One approach, if you have a favorite stylistic tradition, is to see<br/>which tunings seem to fit your tradition, or give it a different color<br/>that you like. Thus I started with Pythagorean tuning for 13th-14th<br/>century medieval European music, and meantone for 16th-century<br/>Renaissance music.</p><p>At this point I was simply playing familiar music in the standard<br/>historical tunings, a new experience for me but also a restoration of<br/>the period practice rather than some radically innovative<br/>interpretation. Of course, when unfamiliar, the traditional can be<br/>quite refreshingly new.</p><p>Gradually, I found myself involved in a &quot;branching out&quot; process --<br/>trying &quot;new things&quot; in traditional tunings, or new tunings in which I<br/>seem to have a certain tendency often to try traditional things.</p><p>One of the steps, for example, was setting up a 24-note meantone<br/>tuning basically a subset of the 31-note system of Nicola Vicentino<br/>(1555), one of the great European xenharmonicists. It was very<br/>exciting to hear some of the cadences he wrote and described almost<br/>450 years ago, and to experiment with some progressions.</p><p>Also, I had started out with an interest in a 24-note Pythagorean<br/>tuning to approximate some ratios of 7 -- and found that one branch of<br/>my tunings involves two 12-note Pythagorean tunings at various<br/>distances between the keyboards. These systems combine the old and the<br/>new. Each keyboard in itself might be identical to an early 12-note<br/>instrument from the 14th century; but mixing notes from the two<br/>keyboards is something else again.</p><p>While I experimented with a &quot;new&quot; system, 17-tone equal temperament,<br/>very early on, it took a couple of years before I became more<br/>generally focused on what has become one of my main interests: tunings<br/>with fifths tempered wider than pure, going a bit outside of<br/>historical European practice (although some of the resulting types of<br/>intervals might have occurred in the free vocal intonation of some<br/>medieval European ensembles).</p><p>Since then, I&apos;ve also become fascinated with various ancient Greek<br/>tunings based on integer ratios, and also medieval Near Eastern<br/>tunings and scales which I sometimes mix with medieval European types<br/>of styles in a kind of &quot;fusion.&quot;</p><p>While my approach tends to start from certain stylistic or historical<br/>premises, that isn&apos;t the only way people might go about this: someone<br/>might simply hear something on Dave Hill&apos;s recording, for example,<br/>which sounds really beautiful or impressive, and decide to explore<br/>some of the intervals or scales involved.</p><p>The most important processes seem to be listening, and maybe singing<br/>or playing, and seeing how something sounds, whether it attracts a<br/>given person&apos;s tastes at a given point, and if so, how it might be<br/>used or creatively varied.</p><p>Theory is helpful, but practice and experience are where lots of the<br/>learning happens, with theory as a tool for summing up some of one&apos;s<br/>experience, and considering what else one might like to experience, or<br/>why two styles of music vary and what some of the qualities of each<br/>might be -- and maybe how the two might be combined, or lead to a<br/>third kind of alternative.</p><p>These are just a few impressions, and to I&apos;d like to say to Marc, &quot;Welcome<br/>to the world of alternative tunings.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38859 href="#38859">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/27/2002 10:45:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, hello again Margo!</p><p>I guess it&apos;s no surprise to see you back in action, now that your major article has appeared in the recent issue of &quot;1/1&quot;!</p><p>Good to have you back, and nice article too - what I could understand of it... :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=38861 href="#38861">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2002 3:19:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Marc Macauley&quot; &lt;op132@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Suggestions?</p><p>Scala can take a file and sequence it into a microtonal midi file.

The only thing possibly keeping it from complete generality is getting octave<br/>stretching to work, but it&apos;s likely Manuel knows how to do that.</p></div><h3><a id=38867 href="#38867">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>8/30/2002 5:43:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The only thing possibly keeping it from complete generality is getting<br/>octave<br/>&gt;stretching to work, but it&apos;s likely Manuel knows how to do that.</p><p>The &quot;equal&quot; statement in a .seq file can take an optional second<br/>parameter for the size of the octave.<br/>Or it uses the current scale, in absence of a scale defining statement<br/>in the file.</p><p>I&apos;ve made another addition, you can click on John Chalmers&apos; triangular<br/>tetrachord diagram to select and play a tetrachord, go to<br/>Analyse-&gt;Tetrachord player.</p><p>The entry of irregular temperaments (or modified meantones) also has<br/>been made easier, go to File-&gt;New-&gt;Temperament.</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=38870 href="#38870">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2002 5:59:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38833.html#38866">/tuning/topicId_38833.html#38866</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joe, I think Gene was a little (uncharacteristically) loose with<br/>the description.
