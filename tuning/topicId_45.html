This<br/>also works for the 70-any and 8-factor diamond.  Presumably (although I do<br/>not know) it works at any limit with an even number of factors because<br/>CPS&apos;s with the &quot;at a time&quot; value equal to 1/2 the number of possible<br/>factors can exist (these are special CPS&apos;s with the same number of harmonic<br/>and subharmonic elements).  I do not know how diamonds and CPS&apos;s interact<br/>on the lattice in an odd number of dimensions.</p><p>Anyhow, the point is, there&apos;s a good picture of the 4-factor diamond and<br/>hexany &quot;doing it&quot; at...</p><p><a href="http://www.servtech.com/~rwgray/synergetics/s10/figs/f3230.html">http://www.servtech.com/~rwgray/synergetics/s10/figs/f3230.html</a></p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=50 href="#50">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1998 3:47:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In response to Carl Lumma&apos;s essay on the interaction between the diamond<br/>and the CPS composed of similar factors let me point out one interesting<br/>one. If one places two diamonds on complementary functions a CPS will be<br/>formed. This reminds me of the old picture where first you see a vase.<br/>Then two faces facing each other. This Analogy is not quite accurate.<br/>Wilson (myself and others) have seen the relationship as a Male/Female<br/>relationship in the Jungian sense of the terms. An interesting property<br/>of the Lamdoma is that one need not reduce all the pitches to one<br/>octave. In such cases of some of the straight forward spacing, the<br/>adjacent intervals will all be super particular.<br/>    I know I promised XenXll a while ago and am sorry I haven&apos;t put it<br/>up but I hope to do it soon!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=110 href="#110">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
