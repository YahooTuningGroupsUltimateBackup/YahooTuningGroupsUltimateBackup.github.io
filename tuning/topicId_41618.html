That your subjective response is objective. or to be more<br/>generous that<br/>&gt;even a group subjective response can be objective<br/>&gt;wheather a minority or not.</p><p>If you&apos;re referring to the response of a tuning, then it is very<br/>difficult (but perhaps not impossible) to justify scientifically. If<br/>you&apos;re referring to music in general, then if one piece of music can<br/>be better than another (see my other post for why I believe this),<br/>then it is safe to assume that people who prefer that better music<br/>will have better taste in music - whether they are in the minority or<br/>majority.</p><p>&gt;2. That an objective evaluation of a tuning can be made. This<br/>assumes that all<br/>&gt;people hear exactly the same. WHat can you present to prove this or<br/>that all<br/>&gt;people want exactly the same thing from music and the way they tune.</p><p>(If I may change the word &apos;want&apos; in your last sentence to &apos;should<br/>want&apos; to clarify the question). I have no actual proof again as such.<br/>I won&apos;t attempt an answer because this question leads off into too<br/>many sub-questions, and requires me to pinpoint the<br/>(speculative) &apos;evidence&apos; for/against each tuning or music &apos;style&apos;<br/>(which would take more than a few paragraphs! :). It is something I<br/>fundamentally believe though - but I could be wrong... :)</p><p>About your point about whether people hear the same; maybe some might<br/>hear one note as a slightly different pitch instead. What do others<br/>think? Could people hear one pitch as really another slightly<br/>different pitch?</p><p>&gt;3. That only one tuning system can be the best.</p><p>Another question is whether any measure would be at a point<br/>from &apos;worst&apos; to &apos;best&apos;.... or more like: &apos;right&apos;/&apos;degree of wrong&apos; or<br/>even a mix. (Personally, I believe it is the &apos;right/wrong&apos; approach).<br/>As for proof (or rather lack of it), see my answer to Q2.</p><p>Well, I managed to get through that lot without mentioning &quot;12-teT&quot; -<br/>wow ;)</p><p>&gt;you have to justify these assunmptions as being possible before we<br/>can even<br/>&gt;discuss what the possible answer would be.<br/>&gt;In iy placew here is at least one question i can ask<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Why did other cultures not use 12 ET from the beginning</p><p>Many answers, but here are a few possibilities:<br/>a: They didn&apos;t have the means to easily produce a 12-eT instrument<br/>(or did, but by habit - produced only non 12-eT instruments).<br/>b: You&apos;ll often find new systems take a while to catch on because of<br/>tradition, especially if the aforementioned instruments are<br/>arbitrarily tailored to non-12eT temperaments in the initial stage.<br/>c: Music isn&apos;t just melody and harmony. It can still sound quite good<br/>relying just on texture, rhythm and sound. (All of the attributes<br/>though, are best for any given tune IMHO ;)</p><p>&gt;why don&apos;t all cultures use chords.</p><p>See my previous answer (C).</p><p>&gt;Are there certain instruments that are objective better than others?</p><p>My personal answer would be indeed - yes :) Even the qualities of<br/>orchestral instruments could be improved (or &apos;tweaked&apos;)<br/>mathematically - if those qualities were determined accurately. It<br/>goes without saying that a particular timbre should be tailored<br/>according to the other timbres present in the tune (and the content<br/>of the tune generally).<br/>For proof of why certain timbres/sounds are better than others, I<br/>would need to explain why certain fundamental patterns are better<br/>than others - not exactly an easy task! ;)</p><p>&gt;Is there one style of singing that is objectively better.</p><p>The voice is a mathematically elaborated and &apos;evolving&apos; variation of<br/>a multi-spectral sine wave (wow, did I ever make /that/ sound dull! ;)<br/>And yes, of course there is IMHO - but this will change according to<br/>the general content of the tune :)<br/>Given the same tune, I would say that there is one best singing<br/>style, but that other &apos;styles&apos; could be better in different ways<br/>(but &apos;worse&apos; on the /average/ maybe). Same goes for different singers<br/>too.</p><p>&gt;Is there also a best tempo, meter, compositional form, duration,<br/>time of day<br/>&gt;of performance, extramusical intent, etc?</p><p>Very good questions! I&apos;ll answer a couple of those...</p><p>Tempo: To truly rate the quality of a tempo, one would first need to<br/>take all of the other attributes of the tune into account.<br/>I don&apos;t like to seperate the attribute of &apos;tempo&apos; from the rest of<br/>the tune, but if forced, I would say that on &apos;average&apos;,<br/>all &apos;reasonable&apos; &apos;tempos&apos; are close to each other in objective<br/>quality. To answer any further would need a more thorough definition<br/>of &apos;tempo&apos; :)</p><p>Duration: Perfect length for a tune? Yes, the longer it is, the more<br/>you can pack into it :) (...not many good tunes can be made lasting<br/>only a few seconds - or with only a few notes ;)<br/>Using this logic, the longer a tune is, the better it will be. The<br/>question would then be; would it improve at a linear (logarithmic<br/>even?) rate forever, or would there be a curve/vanishing point to a<br/>tune&apos;s quality according to its length? Your guess is as good as mine<br/>here ;)</p><p>As to your other points (compositional form etc.), they need to be<br/>split up into more fundamental attributes before they can easily be<br/>answered, but ultimately, yes - I believe they all have objective<br/>degrees of quality. Obviously, they all depend on each other too (for<br/>example, one tempo might be best with a certain compositional form,<br/>while another tempo might be best with another form etc. etc. - all<br/>very, very complex).</p><p>&gt; and if not why would there be a best tuning?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Daniel (<a href="mailto:soundburst@lycos.com">soundburst@lycos.com</a>)</p></div><h3><a id=41647 href="#41647">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2002 6:50:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel White &lt;soundburst@l...&gt;&quot;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_41618.html#41645">/tuning/topicId_41618.html#41645</a></p><p>&gt; Duration: Perfect length for a tune?

A piece can<br/>*easily* be ruined if it&apos;s too long... or at least in the kind of<br/>style *I&apos;m* writing in and thinking about at the moment.</p><p>The best timing, I personally feel, is to go a little on the<br/>*shorter* side, rather than the over long... leaving the audience<br/>still wishing to hear a little bit more...</p><p>J.
