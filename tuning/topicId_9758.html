Not only is the<br/>&gt; technique staggering, but the feeling, the emotional depth, is amazing.<br/>&gt; He&apos;s really playing on a deep level.</p><p>Is this a recent recording? I do have his recording of Mussorgsky&apos;s Pictures<br/>at an Exhibition. I was sceptical before I heard it (that was in 1981) but<br/>already after a few notes I was listening very concentrated. Today I think<br/>that was still the best thing  Yamashita ever did. During the years musical<br/>&apos;athletism&apos; always seemed to generate his artistic output: complete Sor,<br/>transcriptions of Dvorak 9th Symphonie, Stravinsky&apos;s Firebird (two guitars),<br/>Beethoven&apos;s Violin Concert... His CD with Villa-Lobos&apos; Studies and Preludes<br/>is inaudible, way to fast and -sorry to say- really out of tune! I feel<br/>sorry for this, because his potential is enormous. Is there new hope with<br/>this Bach recording?</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
