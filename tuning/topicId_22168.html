Finnamore&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:daeron@bellsouth.net">daeron@bellsouth.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s another monkey that could be thrown into that wrench.  What happens<br/>&gt; when you have two scale degrees within one of those ranges, one toward the<br/>&gt; middle and one toward the outside?  Say you have a scale with degrees at both<br/>&gt; 694_  and 736_.  Or you stretch your octave to 1242_ and end up with a<br/>&gt; &quot;leading tone&quot; of 1195_.  [In the voice of the Godfather:] What then?  Huh?</p><p>This scale tool I&apos;ve been playing with about ran into exactly the this<br/>problem. Although one of the charming things about microtonality is the<br/>ability to have &apos;bruised unisons&apos; and the like, I see them as fundamentally<br/>different than a useful melodic interval.</p><p>I see the problem as very similar to consistency, and am working<br/>on a classification system for the diatonic systems I&apos;ve been looking<br/>at. [I&apos;m looking for systems which hopefully will have 1) useful<br/>melodic properties and 2) many consonances 3) be transposable as<br/>means of exploring new sounds through counterpoint].</p><p>Here &apos;scale&apos; refers to the set of all rotations of an ordered set<br/>of pitches and &apos;mode&apos; refers to a specific rotation.</p><p>C0 : No tones in a mode are different approximations for the same<br/>     rational interval. This eliminates exactly the case you refer<br/>     to above.</p><p>C1 : No tones in a scale use different approximations for the same<br/>     rational interval. In this case, if two modes have a 9/5, then<br/>     they also use the same approximation, even if the scale is<br/>     improper to the point that the 9/5 is on different degrees. This<br/>     may not be so meaningful since historically, composers have<br/>     sometimes seemed to prefer this attribute. As one used to the<br/>     surety of an EDO, I at least want to identify when this occurs.</p><p>C2 : Composite scale with one cycle of &apos;sharps&apos; added has no tones<br/>     using different approximations to the same rational interval.</p><p>C3 : Composite scale with two cycles of &apos;sharps&apos; has...etc.</p><p>Of course, if adding a cycle of sharps got you back to where you<br/>started then its a closed system. If it is unclosed, then eventually<br/>you will crash at one of these &quot;C&quot; dimensions.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sticky hypothetical situations aside, I would prefer to define the octave<br/>&gt; in terms of Western music theory.  I would use a different term for<br/>&gt; approximations of the 2:1 in other musics.</p><p>In the recent thread about this, I was looking for ways of approaching<br/>the 2/1 with the same approach towards consistency as any other interval.<br/>If across the range of the tuning, going up N steps is always going up<br/>by the best 2/1, then that is &quot;2-limit consistent&quot; and whatever the<br/>actual ratio, that is the functional &quot;octave&quot; in the tuning,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
