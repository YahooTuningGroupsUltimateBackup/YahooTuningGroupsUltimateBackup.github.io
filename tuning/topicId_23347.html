There is a crowd of<br/>people who are fascinated with Wyscvhegradsky&apos;s music and with Arseny<br/>Avraamov&apos;s theoretical writings - I even had the chance to meet the son of<br/>the latter. Present-day electronic composers are trying their hand at some<br/>microtonal electronic music. I am now reading a book by the theorist, Alexei<br/>Ogolevets, called &quot;Introduction to Contemporary Musical Thinking&quot;, which was<br/>published in 1946, during the height of the Stalin years. Now, as it<br/>happens, regarding his behavior Ogolevets was a really odious character, who<br/>played an unfavorable role during the purge on artists in 1948. At the same<br/>time, strange at may seem, he was a brilliant musical mind, who developed an<br/>original theory of tunings amnd temperaments, very much along the line of<br/>what you, folks, are doing. Sometimes it happens in life that villainy can<br/>combine with genius. I have just started reading the book, so I can&apos;t<br/>summarize the whole thing (it&apos;s long!).</p><p>When one starts to read the book, one can see that he&apos;s a real intellectual<br/>mind, but one can also see a plenty of ideological infiltrations from his<br/>time, which at this late date sound quite comical. He starts by examining<br/>the Pythagorean perfect fifths tuning, why C# is higher that Db, why are<br/>most accidentals spelled as sharps in ascending scalar motion and as flats<br/>in descending motion and how the cycle of fifths determines the higher<br/>sharps and lower flats. Then he examines the Just Intonation temperament,<br/>which he starts to condemn as a &quot;false&quot; system used by &quot;reactionary,<br/>clerical forces&quot; (while, presumably the &quot;progressive, revolutionary&quot; forces<br/>all used the Pythagarean system) He denounces Zarlino, Rameau and Riemann as<br/>false prophets for basing their theories on the &quot;mystical&quot; overtone scale<br/>(as opposed to the &quot;realist&quot; circle of fifths), stating that &quot;C sharp is<br/>never lower than D flat, it is always higher&quot;, and, lastly, criticizes<br/>Riemann for accepting both systems - the Pythagorean and the Just<br/>Intonation. While all this ideaolgical hogwash sounds very comical when we<br/>read it nowadays, the question still persists: whether this kind of attitude<br/>(extreme hostility towards Just Intonation temperament as an &quot;unnatural&quot;<br/>one, and favoring the Pythagorean system as the &quot;natural&quot; one) has ever been<br/>found in the last few centuries - the 18th, the 19th, the 20th, and<br/>particularly around the 1940&apos;s, when the book was written. Is this some kind<br/>of pronounced position of a large quantity of theorists, based on objective<br/>assumptions (and, respectively, countered by other theorists)? Or is this<br/>the drivel of a Soviet idealogue of the 1940&apos;s who is on the lookout for<br/>enemies, wherever he could find them in his imagination?</p><p>I won&apos;t bore you with chapter-by-chapter summaries of this book, but I will<br/>try to share my experiences of it with you after I will finish reading it -<br/>or if I find some really interesting, mind-boggling ideas on the way. This<br/>Pro-Pythagorean and Anti-Just Intonation really puzzled me on the way, so<br/>that&apos;s why I decided to check with you whether there have been any other<br/>cases of this kind, or is this just drivel to be overlooked.</p></div><h3><a id=23348 href="#23348">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 2:45:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Ant&quot; &lt;ant@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23347.html#23347">/tuning/topicId_23347.html#23347</a></p><p>I am now reading a book by the theorist, Alexei<br/>&gt; Ogolevets, called &quot;Introduction to Contemporary Musical Thinking&quot;,<br/>which was published in 1946, during the height of the Stalin years.</p><p>Hello Anton!</p><p>Thanks so much for your interesting post.

Well, we recently had a<br/>debate on the list contrasting the NOTATION of Just Intonation using<br/>Pythagorean tuning rather than 5-limit Just as a basis, but that is a<br/>different matter, so it will be up to some of our more &quot;historically<br/>minded&quot; posters to answer if this conflict has had historical<br/>precedent...</p><p>_________ _______ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=23349 href="#23349">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 2:56:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, Anton, the most obvious one to me is Charles Ives.

Pythagorean tuning was most<br/>appropriate for Medieval music, but since the Renaissance, at least a 5-limit of consonance has<br/>been the norm in the West. From before 1500 to 1800, meantone tuning was used, so G# was<br/>usually lower than, and never higher than, Ab. Around 1800 there was an aesthetic shift (similar<br/>to one that has occured about 80 years earlier) from meantone toward equal temperament<br/>(even on string instruments) and somtimes all the way to Pythagorean intonation. I hope to write<br/>more about this in the future. But it&apos;s not uncommon to see theorists proclaim the perfect fifth as<br/>supreme and discount all other intervals (other than octaves, fourths, etc.)</p><p>&gt; Or is this<br/>&gt; the drivel of a Soviet idealogue of the 1940&apos;s who is on the lookout for<br/>&gt; enemies, wherever he could find them in his imagination?</p><p>Always a possibility.</p></div><h3><a id=23397 href="#23397">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 9:25:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23347.html#23349">/tuning/topicId_23347.html#23349</a></p><p>&gt; Well, Anton, the most obvious one to me is Charles Ives.

As I read further into the book last night, I did arrive to the<br/>conclusion that Ogolevets was basically advocating a return to Pythagorean<br/>tuning for tonal music of a Classical-Romantical trend (which for him is the<br/>only acceptible kind of music), which in this case would become the harmonic<br/>foundationof tonal music - here, the distinction between the respective<br/>flats and sharps would become decisively more important, since they would<br/>&quot;gravitate&quot; towards their respective tonic. Also the phenomenon of the<br/>syntonic comma would be something not to be overlooked. (He writes:<br/>&quot;quarter-tone theorists and composers are all wrong, since they split the<br/>equal-tempered half-tone in half, while overlooking the comma.&quot;) My friend,<br/>Mark Belodubrovsky, a composer from Bryansk, who suggested the book to me,<br/>claims that this theory and this kind of thinking could very well be<br/>extended and applied to atonal music as well (despite Ogolevets&apos; harsh<br/>anti-atonal stance), so the theory is more advanced than its author even<br/>perceives it to be. It&apos;s just that I have never heard of anyone talk about<br/>Just Intonation tuning being &quot;wrong&quot;. Have any of you ever heard of such a<br/>thing? The overtone series, after all, is a product of nature. Does he<br/>actually think that it was imagined by &quot;metaphysically inclined theorists&quot;?</p><p>The book is written in a very systematic, scholarly way, and you end up<br/>learning a lot from it. It does mention the attempts at 17-equal and<br/>31-equal scales of the 16th century. It does have a lot of prescriptions of<br/>&quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, but we can just laugh at most of those. Still, the book<br/>is rather dated - being from the 1940&apos;s - and, moreover, it is Soviet, so I<br/>realize that all of this material is rather elementary, compared to what<br/>you, folks, are doing. So I should probably run through the book quickly and<br/>go on to reading more advanced theory books. This book should be probably<br/>best viewed from a historical perspective - though Harry Partch&apos;s &quot;Genesis<br/>of a Music&quot; and Joseph Yasser&apos;s book about his 19-tone scale are probably<br/>still more advanced.</p></div><h3><a id=23424 href="#23424">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/21/2001 6:55:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/21/01 12:30:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; But Johnny, Ives never had any obvious antipathy to Just Intonation<br/>&gt; as did Ogolevets, did he?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>No antipathy, but &quot;hearing&quot; JI intervals was not something mastered by Ives.<br/>So, a machine was needed (as opposed to quartertones, and an eventual<br/>Pythagorean in performance).
