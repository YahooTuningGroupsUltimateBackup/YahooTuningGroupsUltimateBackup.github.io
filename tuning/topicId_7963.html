I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;arbitrarily use the same starting pitches:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   C major:<br/>&gt;      C  +5.68<br/>&gt;      E  -8.01<br/>&gt;      G  +7.49  (change: +5.94 cents)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   A minor:<br/>&gt;      C  +8.67 (change: +2.99 cents)<br/>&gt;      E  -5.02  (change: +2.99 cents)<br/>&gt;      A  -6.84<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   D minor:<br/>&gt;      D  -2.66<br/>&gt;      F +12.86<br/>&gt;      A  -0.90  (change: +5.94 cents)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   G major:<br/>&gt;      B -12.24<br/>&gt;      D  +3.28  (change: +5.94 cents)<br/>&gt;      G  +1.53<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Here the total squared shift is 3*(5.94)^2+2*(2.99)^2 = 123.7310</p><p>Well, Paul, you had me going for awhile trying to match or beat that<br/>number!  But it turns out it&apos;s a phantom value; the ideal comma pump<br/>with truly exact vertical intervals would have a total squared shift of<br/>132.15 (based upon theoretical best distribution: 2/7 comma, or 6.1447<br/>cents, at the three points where only one note shifts, and 1/7 comma, or<br/>3.0723 cents, where two notes shift).  I see now that you began by<br/>&quot;taking&quot; the slight variation from exact JI that I had produced.  All<br/>well and good, but we&apos;re splitting unimportant hairs here!  And you<br/>already agree that slight reduction from exact JI is desirable, so<br/>what&apos;s the point?</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul H.

We need two words for &quot;small&quot; or<br/>&quot;slight&quot;.  The comma pump I originally put forth, TD 492.2, allows<br/>enough relaxation from exact vertical JI to make a significant<br/>improvement in horizontal motion: a mere 70.27 sum of squares.  I&apos;m<br/>saying that we both think this type of motion recovery is worthwhile,<br/>so it&apos;s splitting hairs to refine to the nth degree what would happen if<br/>we DIDN&apos;T take some relaxation of this sort.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
