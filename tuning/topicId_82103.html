No click in there, but obviously Vincent worked for little cells that repeat and are extrapolated upon. While this is the standard MO of a zillion loopers in the modern sense, he is completely without any clich&eacute; aside from his ownÂ….a trait show in negative squared most music I hear. And while all his music exploits this very same formula, it&apos;s the results and their decided independence from others that lights me up. Because Vincent is his own man in exactly the way that makes me excited about art---by not taking the easy way out or the predictable route to repetition or even satisfying common and uncommon  expectations, he makes HIS music.A great artist in my mind, and one of the few rare originals in this or any other field IMO.<br/>daniel</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like that a lot!<br/>&gt; A nice hybrid of composition, performance, and something like audio<br/>&gt; editing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, I&apos;m going to have to<br/>&gt; try something like that<br/>&gt; myself one of these days--maybe with my piano pieces.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It held my interest for the whole time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I liked how it started to ebb a little around 7:30, and I liked the<br/>&gt; very end--<br/>&gt; though there was a click in my version--maybe you need some silence, a<br/>&gt; little bit of<br/>&gt; a fade at very, very end. ...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; caleb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mar 7, 2009, at 11:31 AM, daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; for anyone who might be interested, i&apos;ve been working on some<br/>&gt; &gt; collaborations with Vincent Bergeron, whose music, artistic<br/>&gt; &gt; commitment, and integrity i&apos;ve long admired:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.yousendit.com/download/U0d3SU5BMm1ENlJjR0E9PQ">http://www.yousendit.com/download/U0d3SU5BMm1ENlJjR0E9PQ</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i just love the Copland-like hoedown/Irish dance interludes, and<br/>&gt; &gt; Viveka Eriksson (female vocals) and Jorg Fischer(traps) really shine<br/>&gt; &gt; here as well IMO-----&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; check it!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=82118 href="#82118">ðŸ”—</a>Carlo Serafini &#x3C;carlo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2009 2:30:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I already told Vincent I love it<br/>:-)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot; &lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for anyone who might be interested, i&apos;ve been working on some collaborations with Vincent Bergeron, whose music, artistic commitment, and integrity i&apos;ve long admired:</p></div>
