The decatonic<br/>scales in 22-tone temperament.  Harmonic entropy.  Among the<br/>coolest microtonal ideas I know of, for five continuous years.<br/>The synthesis of an enormous range of psychoacoustic and musical<br/>literature that was never even attempted before Paul did it.  The<br/>gentle explanation of periodicity blocks as a unifying concept,<br/>which no one else quite saw like Paul did.</p><p>Perhaps most significant is the social role Paul has played,<br/>bringing a huge number and wide range of folks together in<br/>countless discussions they might never have had otherwise.  All<br/>thanks to Paul -- he&apos;s really an amazing guy.  Thanks, Paul!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=32901 href="#32901">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2002 1:19:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;clumma&quot; &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Among the<br/>&gt; coolest microtonal ideas I know of, for five continuous years.</p><p>Thanks, Carl! I know you also really liked my &quot;Hypothesis&quot;, almost a<br/>year old now . . . and I&apos;m pretty psyched about my &quot;Heuristic&quot; these<br/>days, though no one seems to want to touch it with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>Rock on, Carl!</p></div>
