On initial hearing, both of the sine-wave<br/>thirds struck me as &quot;good&quot; (although I hear the difference clearly) and both<br/>of the triangle thirds struck me as &quot;flat.&quot; So, does timbre influence the<br/>perception of pitch and consonance? Evidently, it _does.</p><p>As I replayed the examples, I thought the high third (before the fifth came<br/>in) was a bit _too high, but very close to &quot;my&quot; high third. However, when<br/>the fifth entered it seemed to &quot;justify&quot; the high tuning of the third.</p><p>I then played and compared short snippets of each of the thirds before the<br/>fifth entered, then short snippets of the whole triads. To some extent the<br/>differences faded as my ears accommodated the sounds and (perhaps) morphed<br/>them to fit my &quot;acceptable&quot; range.</p><p>A most intriguing experience occurred while listening to the sine wave<br/>example containing the 5:4 third. Upon repeated playings, I had the<br/>impression that when the fifth entered the third raised slightly to sound<br/>more like the &quot;high third.&quot; Clearly, Dan did not change the actual physical<br/>pitch of the third, yet my perception could easily &quot;hear&quot; it as having moved<br/>higher. The impression was not as vivid in the triangle wave example, but it<br/>was still there. As each of these sounds drifted to silence, the &quot;echo&quot;<br/>tuned to my concept of the high third.</p><p>Then I went back to the 24/19 examples and experienced the same thing. While<br/>the third before the fifth came in was &quot;in the ballpark,&quot; when the fifth<br/>came in it seemed to move slightly higher. Again, more clearly in the sine<br/>wave example and to a lesser extent in the triangle wave example.</p><p>Apparently, at least two things are happening here. (1) There appears to be<br/>more than one &quot;acceptable&quot; version of a well-tuned third (no surprise), and<br/>(2) no matter which third is &quot;preferred,&quot; the presence of the fifth seems to<br/>modify (raise) the perception of the relative pitch of that third.</p><p>I hope many of you will listen to these sound examples and post your<br/>impressions. I think I&apos;ll stick around a bit longer and see where this one<br/>lands. :-)))))</p><p>Good one, Dan!</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8937 href="#8937">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2000 5:28:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan Wolf said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry Eskelin&apos;s reactions to the wav files suggest that his impression of a<br/>&gt; raised third has little to do with the actual size of the intervals<br/>&gt; involved.</p><p>At least in this case. I mentioned in that post that there may be two<br/>different things involved in understanding the &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon.<br/>(More to come when I have time to frame my thoughts on this carefully.)</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t doubt that Jerry is hearing the interval move, but I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t hear it myself.  Perhaps this phenomena is more in the realm of<br/>&gt; individual psychology -- each one of us has a lifetime of experience with<br/>&gt; musical materials, and the ways in which we experience and identify these<br/>&gt; materials can be highly individualized.</p><p>I think you are right. But before we accept that you can&apos;t hear this pitch<br/>change, try tuning a keyboard note to her first G and then see if you hear<br/>it move off that tuning when you compare her G to that same keyboard note<br/>after the final chord arrives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If your main performing situation is with choral voices, where even a unison<br/>&gt; is more a matter of faith than fact,  the amount of wavering is probably<br/>&gt; going to be well within the whole range of intervals we&apos;ve been discussing.</p><p>Perhaps. Of course there are vocal unisons and then there are vocal unisons.<br/>I&apos;m not saying LA Jazz Choir unisons are perfect, but they&apos;re damned close.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;ve added two more downloadable WAV files with the<br/>&gt; same chord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/9.7.WAV">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/9.7.WAV</a><br/>&gt; has the tenth tuned to 18:7 (the septimal 9:7 plus an octave)<br/>&gt;<br/>This is &quot;way sharp&quot; both before and after the fifth enters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/81.64.WAV">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/81.64.WAV</a><br/>&gt; has the tenth tuned to 81:32 (the pythagorean 81:64 plus an octave)</p><p>This is still a bit sharp, but I wouldn&apos;t kick it out of bed.</p><p>Thanks for your interest in this topic, Dan</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8965 href="#8965">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

In any case, please note that Daniel Wolf&apos;s<br/>examples were highly artificial in that the timbres were a sine wave, which<br/>contains no harmonics, and a triangle wave, which contains no even harmonics<br/>and is sort of an idealized clarinet. The &quot;shifting&quot; Jerry heard with the<br/>sine waves is consistent with the effect I mentioned earlier (I cited some<br/>German papers) where sine-wave pitches tend to push one another apart.</p></div>
