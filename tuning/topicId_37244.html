So there<br/>&gt; really isn&apos;t much microtonality in them.  But I feel that what<br/>&gt; little *is* there, is extremely significant for any student of tuning<br/>&gt; history, as they are the only surviving examples of microtonal<br/>&gt; music from the founding members of the so-called &quot;Second Viennese<br/>&gt; School&quot; (Schoenberg and his two most famous students, Berg and<br/>&gt; Webern).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is important primarily because it was mainly<br/>&gt; due to Schoenberg&apos;s influence (especially via his &quot;Method of<br/>&gt; Composition with 12 Tones related only to one another&quot;, known<br/>&gt; popularly as the &quot;12-tone method&quot;, &quot;dodecaphony&quot;, or &quot;serialism&quot;,<br/>&gt; which was developed around 1920) that 12-tone equal-temperament<br/>&gt; became the *de facto* standard tuning for most of the musical<br/>&gt; world during the 20th Century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But evidence from Schoenberg himself, in a letter to Busoni<br/>&gt; dated 24 August 1909, proves that shortly before that date<br/>&gt; he had experimented with quarter-tones himself, and ultimately<br/>&gt; decided not to use them.  And then the following summer, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; wrote his famous _Harmonielehre_ (&quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot;), in<br/>&gt; which he discusses tuning and temperament and gives favorable<br/>&gt; mention to microtonality several times.  He does give several<br/>&gt; justifications there for &quot;the time not being yet right&quot; for<br/>&gt; their use, citing chiefly the lack of properly-tuned instruments,<br/>&gt; but he also states confidently that at some point in the future<br/>&gt; their employment would be inevitable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My speculation is that Schoenberg&apos;s primary reason for rejecting<br/>&gt; microtones was that he had already entered his period of<br/>&gt; &quot;atonal&quot; composition in 1908 (he always preferred to call it<br/>&gt; &quot;pantonal&quot;), his recent premieres had caused the biggest scandals<br/>&gt; in Viennese concert history, and he probably didn&apos;t think it<br/>&gt; prudent to add any other aspects to his music that would render<br/>&gt; it even *less* performable or less likely to be performed, thus<br/>&gt; the resolution to stick to the 12-tone equal-temperament already<br/>&gt; in general use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first completely &quot;atonal&quot; opus by Schoenberg was his<br/>&gt; song-cycle on poems of Stefan George, _Das Buch der<br/>&gt; h&iuml;&iquest;&half;ngenden G&iuml;&iquest;&half;rten_ (&quot;The Book of the Hanging Gardens&quot;),<br/>&gt; composed in two separate periods, the first group of songs<br/>&gt; in March and April 1908, and the second group from September 1908<br/>&gt; to February 1909.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both of these periods of compositional activity were precipitated<br/>&gt; by calamitous events in Schoenberg&apos;s life.  He had become very<br/>&gt; close to Mahler from 1904 on, and often became involved in heated<br/>&gt; arguments weith Mahler over his innovative musical ideas, while<br/>&gt; Mahler nonetheless felt a strong conviction towards Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; actual compositions.  Mahler had ostentatiously applauded<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s _1st Quartet_ (from 1904/05) at the premiere on<br/>&gt; February 1907 (amid much booing and hissing from the majority<br/>&gt; of the audience) and wrote to Richard Strauss that he found it<br/>&gt; &quot;profound and impressive&quot;, but a few weeks later, after the<br/>&gt; premiere of Schoenberg&apos;s _Kammersymphonie_ (&quot;Chamber Symphony&quot;,<br/>&gt; from 1906), Mahler lamented to his wife that he &quot;can no longer<br/>&gt; follow Schoenberg&apos;s thought&quot;, adding, however, &quot;but he&apos;s young<br/>&gt; and perhaps he&apos;s right&quot;.  Mahler continued his strong support<br/>&gt; of Schoenberg, both artistically and financially, to the very<br/>&gt; end of his life, whispering on his deathbed (in 1911), &quot;What&apos;s<br/>&gt; going to happen to poor Schoenberg now that I&apos;m gone?&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg felt deeply indebted to this support from Mahler,<br/>&gt; and when Mahler left Vienna for his new job as conductor<br/>&gt; of the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 9 December 1907,<br/>&gt; it caused a bit of an emotional crisis for Schoenberg.  But<br/>&gt; at the same time, it seems to me that without the master&apos;s<br/>&gt; strong criticism, Schoenberg suddenly felt free to indulge<br/>&gt; in his most experimental ideas.  Just a week after Mahler&apos;s<br/>&gt; departure, Schoenberg composed his first setting of a text<br/>&gt; by Stefan George -- and after a period of setting texts<br/>&gt; of many different poets, Schoenberg now felt a real inspiration<br/>&gt; from George&apos;s work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; During most of 1907, Schoenberg had begun drafting his<br/>&gt; _2nd Quartet_, and he and his wife Mathilde (the sister of<br/>&gt; Zemlinsky, his friend and teacher) had also begun taking<br/>&gt; painting lessons from a young and talented artist named<br/>&gt; Richard Gerstl.  Schoenberg had interrupted work on the<br/>&gt; Quartet to compose the first group of George songs in the<br/>&gt; Spring of 1908 -- songs which describe the awakening of a<br/>&gt; new love.  But by the summer, Mathilde&apos;s relationship<br/>&gt; with Gerstl had deepened into a love affair, and Schoenberg<br/>&gt; apparently had at least an inkling of what was going on,<br/>&gt; because he then returned to work on the 2nd Quartet,<br/>&gt; introducing a soprano singing despairing words by George<br/>&gt; in the last two movements.  The last movement is also the<br/>&gt; first piece Schoenberg wrote in which he completely<br/>&gt; relinquished the the usual functions of tonality, although<br/>&gt; he still touches on the tonic F#-minor at key points in the<br/>&gt; structure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the end of August 1908, Mathilde left Schoenberg and their<br/>&gt; two children at their summer house and went back to Vienna with<br/>&gt; Gerstl.  This love triangle caused a great deal of anguish for<br/>&gt; all three of the protagonists, and Schoenberg and Mathilde both<br/>&gt; contemplated suicide.  At this point, Schoenberg decided to<br/>&gt; return to the set of George songs and create an entire cycle<br/>&gt; from the middle set of poems in George&apos;s book, thus now including<br/>&gt; the tragic denoument of the love described in the earlier set<br/>&gt; of songs.  On September 27, he composed _Du lehnest wider eine<br/>&gt; silberweide_ (&quot;You lean against a silver-willow&quot;), the first<br/>&gt; piece without any reference at all to a key.  The vocal part<br/>&gt; of this song also marks a sharp change in style, being very<br/>&gt; dispassionate and declamatory, without a trace of the lyricism<br/>&gt; apparent in all of Schoenberg&apos;s many previous songs.  This is<br/>&gt; important, because I believe that it indicates the beginning of<br/>&gt; his interest in mirroring the pitches used in *speech*, which<br/>&gt; would indicate an interest in microtonality, and which a couple<br/>&gt; of years later would result in his presentation of _sprechstimme_<br/>&gt; (&quot;speech-vocalizing&quot;), used most famously in _Pierrot Lunaire_<br/>&gt; in 1912.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Schoenberg/Gerstl affair ended happily for Schoenberg,<br/>&gt; but not for Gerstl.  In October 1908, mainly at the instigation<br/>&gt; of Webern, Mathilde was persuaded to return to her husband<br/>&gt; and children.  But early in November, at the age of 25, Gerstl<br/>&gt; burned most of his paintings in a bonfile, and then stabbed<br/>&gt; and hung himself.  As evidenced by the changes in his music,<br/>&gt; this whole sequence of events had a profound effect on Schoenberg.<br/>&gt; During the next year, he composed in rapid succession a series of<br/>&gt; the most innovative pieces that had been yet written in the European<br/>&gt; tradition, including his _3 Piano Pieces, op. 11_, _5 Pieces<br/>&gt; for Orchestra, op. 15_, and (immediately after writing the<br/>&gt; above-mentioned letter to Busoni) the amazing monodrama _Erwartung_<br/>&gt; (&quot;Expectation&quot;), op. 17_, and he also began the first work on<br/>&gt; his opera _Die Gl&iuml;&iquest;&half;ckliche Hand_ (&quot;The Lucky Hand&quot;), which<br/>&gt; is based closely on the events of the Gerstl affair.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have searched diligently for examples of microtonal notations<br/>&gt; in Schoenberg&apos;s manuscripts and sketchs, but apparently none<br/>&gt; have survived, the only reference from his own hand being the<br/>&gt; letter to Busoni.  But I think the &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;,<br/>&gt; concerning both he and his student Webern (as discussed below),<br/>&gt; strongly confirms that his microtonal experiments would have<br/>&gt; concerned the vocal parts of his later set of George songs,<br/>&gt; from fall-winter 1908/09.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now to return to Webern...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a famous statement by Schoenberg, he once said, &quot;I have to<br/>&gt; keep all of my new ideas secret from Webern, because he uses<br/>&gt; them before I do, and I thus find myself in the embarassing<br/>&gt; position of seeming to imitate my students&quot;.  The truth of this<br/>&gt; accusation is documented admirably by, among many other things,<br/>&gt; the fact that Webern also began composing songs on texts by George<br/>&gt; at the same time as Schoenberg, and he also apparently composed<br/>&gt; them in two sets, totaling nearly the same number (15 in<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s cycle, and 14 for Webern).  Webern only wrote<br/>&gt; &quot;composed 1908/09&quot; on the whole set of George songs, so it<br/>&gt; is not possible to prove the date of their composition more<br/>&gt; accurately, but only to gain clues from an examination of the<br/>&gt; music-paper and the various plans Webern drew up for the grouping<br/>&gt; of the songs, and from the letters Webern wrote to Schoenberg in<br/>&gt; 1909.  Both of these investigations lead to the conclusion that<br/>&gt; Webern composed a set of about 5 to 7 George songs around the<br/>&gt; winter of 1908/09, and then another set later in 1909.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even more strikingly, the manuscript of &quot;An Baches Ranft&quot;<br/>&gt; (&quot;At the brook&apos;s edge&quot;) has crossed-out sketches at<br/>&gt; the end which use the mathematical symbols &lt; (&quot;less-than&quot;)<br/>&gt; and &gt; (&quot;greater-than&quot;) as accidentals in front of the notes.<br/>&gt; These are *exactly* the same symbols Schoenberg illustrated<br/>&gt; for the indication of quarter-tones in his letter to Busoni.<br/>&gt; This mention in the letter was prompted by the fact that Busoni<br/>&gt; had just sent Schoenberg a copy of his little book<br/>&gt; _Entwurf einer neuen &iuml;&iquest;&half;sthetik der Tonkunst_ (&quot;Outline for a<br/>&gt; new aesthetic of music&quot;), in which he suggests using 36-tone<br/>&gt; equal temperament, conceived as two third-tone scales a<br/>&gt; semitone apart, as an expansion of pitch resources.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me, however, the biggest surprise is that, along with<br/>&gt; verbal comments specifying what he wanted, Webern used<br/>&gt; little crosses instead of note-heads to indicate the microtonal<br/>&gt; pitches.  This is *exactly* the notation Schoenberg later<br/>&gt; used for his _sprechstimme_!  So to supplement Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; accusation about Webern, it must be noted that the stealing<br/>&gt; of ideas between teacher and student apparently flowed both ways.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I find highly significant, and indicative of<br/>&gt; Webern&apos;s slavish relationship to Schoenberg, is that the<br/>&gt; microtones in these two songs appear only in the vocal part,<br/>&gt; and that Webern eliminated them even though they could easily<br/>&gt; have been performed by the singer, as we will hear today.<br/>&gt; The only explanation I can find for this is that once<br/>&gt; Schoenberg (in _Harmonielehre_) decided definitively to<br/>&gt; stick to 12-tone equal-temperament, Webern felt obliged<br/>&gt; to do so as well.  &quot;An Baches Ranft&quot; was the only song of<br/>&gt; the two which Webern actually published during his lifetime,<br/>&gt; and the published version is entirely in 12-tone tuning.<br/>&gt; Interestingly, when Peter Westergaard published &quot;Das Lockere...&quot;<br/>&gt; in 1968, he added natural signs to all of the notes which<br/>&gt; appear in Webern&apos;s manuscript without accidentals, but<br/>&gt; the only note in the entire song which does not have an<br/>&gt; accidental in the published version is the microtonal one<br/>&gt; in Webern&apos;s manuscript.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, as to the significance of the placement of these<br/>&gt; sparsely-used microtones in Webern&apos;s songs:  All of the<br/>&gt; George poems set by Schoenberg and Webern exude a<br/>&gt; highly-charged eroticism.  Interestingly, both of the<br/>&gt; Webern songs which contain microtones use the metaphor<br/>&gt; of the vagina as a freshly-plowed but still unplanted field.<br/>&gt; In &quot;An Baches Ranft&quot;, a pretty Spring image is set up in the<br/>&gt; first three-quarters of the poem, but then at the mention<br/>&gt; of &quot;the tree still grey&quot; the mood changes, and that is<br/>&gt; where Webern used the two microtones, on the words &quot;noch grau&quot;.<br/>&gt; &quot;Das Lockere...&quot; sets up a very similar scenario, and the single<br/>&gt; microtone indicated by Webern is on the last syllable of<br/>&gt; the word &quot;Z&iuml;&iquest;&half;hne&quot;, referring to the teeth of the plow.<br/>&gt; As the vocal part here and in the next line softly dies<br/>&gt; away, the piano part becomes violent.  In the second half<br/>&gt; of the poem the mood becomes more tender, and the music<br/>&gt; softly reflects this change.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Webern&apos;s verbal explanations are along the lines of:<br/>&gt; &quot;voiced softly between E and Eb&quot;, etc.  The appearance of<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s &quot;less-than&quot; and &quot;greater-than&quot; signs at the<br/>&gt; end of the &quot;An Baches Ranft&quot; manuscript imply that he<br/>&gt; wanted quarter-tones, but he never specified *exactly*<br/>&gt; what tuning he wanted for the microtonal pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Much more historical background on these songs can be found<br/>&gt; on my webpage &quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/vienna1905.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I became aware of Webern&apos;s microtonal experiments through<br/>&gt; the article &quot;Weberns verworfene Mikrot&iuml;&iquest;&half;ne&quot; (&quot;Webern&apos;s rejected<br/>&gt; microtones&quot;) by Dominik Schweiger, appearing in _Mitteilungen<br/>&gt; der Paul Sacher Stiftung_, no. 11 (April 1998).
