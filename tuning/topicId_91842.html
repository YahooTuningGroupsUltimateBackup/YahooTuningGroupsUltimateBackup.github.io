The most obvious example being a major triad sounding more sweet than a minor one to many if not most people...but I think the logic can extend to more complex chords.</p><p>Maybe &quot;feel&quot; is a loaded term. The point I was making here though, is<br/>that 33-et&apos;s super-flat meantone diatonic scale is still recognizable<br/>as a diatonic scale. And the I, IV, and V chords still sound like I,<br/>IV, and V - even though they&apos;re neutral. They still, to me, &quot;sound&quot;<br/>like they retain the gestalt sound or &quot;function&quot; of the major chord,<br/>despite not being tuned to 4:5:6. And this is even more notable with<br/>superpyth tunings where the major thirds are closer to 7:9 and the<br/>minor thirds are closer to 6:7, because the fifths don&apos;t have to be so<br/>far out.</p><p>Therefore, part of the overall &quot;schema&quot; that we have for a &quot;major&quot;<br/>chord is how it can be placed within some diatonic scale (pick a mode,<br/>any mode), and thus relate to other nearby chords. And also, this part<br/>of the schema can be activated even if the chords aren&apos;t tuned to<br/>4:5:6. And, thusly therefore and thus, when we talk about &quot;mood,&quot; we<br/>might sometimes be talking about this way of hearing as we are about<br/>harmonic stability.</p><p>One half-assed theory that I have is that the real defining<br/>characteristic of &quot;diatonic&quot; hearing, as far as cognitive processing<br/>is concerned, is that everything is accessible by a few fifths. Note<br/>that with superpyth, meantone, and this ultra-flat meantone, every<br/>note retains its same 3-limit relationship to the root, but that its<br/>direct harmonic relationship to the root changes. If you mess around<br/>with superpyth minor triads, you will clearly hear that they have a<br/>very different subtle &quot;flavor&quot; than 1/3-comma meantone minor triads -<br/>but are still recognizable as diatonic &quot;minor triads&quot; of some kind. I<br/>think that the former has to do with the absolute harmonic<br/>relationship involved, and that the latter has to do with this<br/>fifths-based hearing.</p><p>Whether the fifths-based hearing has to do with some kind of inborn<br/>3-limit JI map, or a learned 3-limit JI map, or has nothing to do with<br/>JI and more to do with the fact that a detuned fifth is a sort of<br/>consonant sounding generator, is beyond me.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2010 12:02:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;The point I was making here though, is that 33-et&apos;s super-flat meantone<br/>diatonic scale is still recognizable<br/>as a diatonic scale.&quot;<br/>  Super-flat?

For a meantone, those fifths are really flat.

Thus the tuning of<br/>the fifth seems to be more important to the recognizability of the<br/>scale than the tuning of the major thirds.</p><p>And if you really want to test this hypothesis, mess around with<br/>mavila[5]. You&apos;ll hear that even though 5/4 and 6/5 switch places, the<br/>whole thing still resembles the normal pentatonic scale. This doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to work as well with mavila-7 though.</p><p>&gt; However you&apos;re right...if I<br/>&gt; get your drift...the way a &quot;compressed&quot; major triad third from that scale<br/>&gt; (IE<br/>&gt; one obviously with 20+ cent difference from pure) sounds like a regular one<br/>&gt; does<br/>&gt; seem to suggest the brain does some heavy-duty rounding that makes it &quot;feel<br/>&gt; normal&quot;.</p><p>But what about superpythagorean minor triads? Those are 6:7:9. Is it<br/>really that the brain is rounding them to 10:12:15, or is something<br/>else going on?</p><p>&gt;    Meaning within a certain number of fifths on a circle of fifths?<br/>&gt; If so...then what on earth happens when you get Mohajira or something where<br/>&gt; one<br/>&gt; of the &quot;fifths&quot; is distinctively not in the circle (IE near 13/9)?</p><p>I&apos;m just talking about diatonic hearing. I am not fluent enough with<br/>mohajira to know how it works yet. I&apos;m just saying that &quot;diatonic<br/>hearing&quot; is often defined as anything matching some kind of LLsLLLs<br/>template, but perhaps the real important characteristic is that it&apos;s<br/>an octave-equivalent set of 7 fifths. For example, mavila-5 and<br/>meantone-5 can sound very equivalent.</p><p>&gt; Also, I notice that 12TET&apos;s &quot;awful&quot; (to me) sounding 6th is generated by<br/>&gt; just<br/>&gt; three chained fifths and then dividing by the octave AND 9/8 is generated by<br/>&gt; just two chained fifths.

That<br/>&gt; is...even<br/>&gt; though a chain of about four fifths produces 5/4.</p><p>I agree and never meat to imply that it does. Just that with diatonic<br/>hearing, the only JI ratio that seems to matter is 3/2. Whether this<br/>is because it&apos;s the generator, or there are no other nearby JI ratios<br/>that conflict with it, or because of some inborn or learned or<br/>conditioned 3-limit JI hearing, is beyond me.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2010 4:50:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>And, if you really want to see an example that will put this to rest,<br/>then go to 22-et and play the C harmonic minor scale.
