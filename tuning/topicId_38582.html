Transformed - yes.</p><p>There seem to be a variety of taste here. Some like the intervals<br/>to be very regular in size, maybe two sizes at most, or three<br/>sizes if the scale is small. Others like scales with many<br/>step sizes, and others don&apos;t particularly notice the step size<br/>unless it is quite a large variation in size. So I wonder<br/>if that might be part of it, as the just scales often have<br/>many different step sizes (not always of course, as the<br/>just intonation MOS scales have only two step sizes<br/>for instance).</p><p>Also they often have many different interval<br/>sizes for the two step intervals, three step intervals<br/>and so on (i.e. many intervals in each interval class).</p><p>I think that the equal tempered scales often have a kind<br/>of floating quality. So do the hexany and dekany etc,<br/>- not at all the same kind of feeling, but I wonder if<br/>liking of the harmonic symmetry of those is related to<br/>a liking of the feeling of no preferred home key that you<br/>often have in equal tempered scales? That&apos;s very<br/>speculative of course.</p><p>Anyway I wonder if we can accept this as a matter of taste?<br/>Some like porridge with salt, and some like it with sugar, and<br/>neither is right or wrong. Some may like it both ways.</p><p>Also, if one is enjoying a tuning oneself then that&apos;s likely<br/>to communicate itself to ones listeners, and it&apos;s quite possible<br/>that they may like it even if it is one they wouldn&apos;t normally<br/>use themselves. Anyway they are surely unlikely to enjoy it if you<br/>don&apos;t like that particular tuning and feel miserable and<br/>at a loss when trying to play in it.</p><p>So I think the most important thing is to find tunings that one<br/>likes and enjoyes oneself, no matter what opinions or theories<br/>there may be about it. For practical composing and music making<br/>anyway.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=38584 href="#38584">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/11/2002 6:49:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_38582.html#38582">/tuning/topicId_38582.html#38582</a></p><p>&gt; Anyway I wonder if we can accept this as a matter of taste?<br/>&gt; Some like porridge with salt, and some like it with sugar, and<br/>&gt; neither is right or wrong.
