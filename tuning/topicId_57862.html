Far from what i did in 31 being atonal, nor were there parties in the Dutch school leaning this way  had trouble with such a notation. Also Jonathan Glasier used this same notation in San diego. One gets used to + and - very very quickly as those who used Fokkers notation did likewise. There is nothing that prevents one from using a double sharp, and in certain cases i would use them. In fact when i used a 22 tone vibraphone tuned to the eikosany, since i also had a 31 tone marimba that overlapped in tones i used the 31 tone notation which appeared a bit akward at first but served my use over 15 years.<br/>   I can&apos;t imagine a 31 tone composer being tied to the diatonic , and the music that has been writtenin 31 bares this out.</p><p>&gt;   From: Rich Holmes&lt;<a href="mailto:rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu">rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Gene&apos;s Bonehead 31-et notation<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt; writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; When i worked with 31 . using + and - were no problem at all .

Emil richards also used it and you can ask Glasier , who exposed it to a myriad of<br/>non tuning specialist if there was a problem.<br/>Nothing is more confusing to me is when you have letter names crossing if we are going to talk about the layman, to have c higher than Ds especially in a meantone system just makes it hard to find where your notes are. Also put it on a keyboard and see where it lies. Double flats are a mess and + and - couldn&apos;t be simpler that saying between a natural and a sharp you have a plus and between a natural and a flat  you have a minus.<br/>No one who i ever showed this to had a problem and this often was to people who were against the idea of microtones at the time.

Which means that each tetrachord will need<br/>to ascend by two &quot;major&quot; steps of a tone, and one &quot;minor&quot; step of<br/>a semitone to reach the perfect fourth from the root.  Any diatonic<br/>scale balanced between utonal and otonal will have two tetrachords,<br/>one with the root as its starting point and the other with the root<br/>as the end point.</p><p>So calling a note Fx or G- doesn&apos;t change the intervals that the<br/>scale comprises.  I think it&apos;s merely a practical consequence of a<br/>scale&apos;s being a balanced diatonic scale that we _can_ notate it with<br/>seven distinct letter names (four in each of two tetrachords, with<br/>only one common letter name between them) - if we choose to do so.</p><p>Eg, a balanced diatonic scale might consist of the upper tetrachord<br/>CDEF, and the lower tetrachord GABC, giving the scale GABCDEF.<br/>(Note I don&apos;t consider it as CDEF + GABC, which gives eight notes<br/>and makes assumptions about octave equivalence.)  Starting a<br/>semitone higher, we have the scale G#A#B#C#D#E#F#.  Starting<br/>a fifth higher still, we have D#E#FxG#A#B#C# - your scale, but<br/>with the tonic in a different position than usual.

Eg: tone C-D diatonic<br/>semitone E-F.</p><p>So, take diesis defined as one step in 31-edo. A tone is then 5<br/>diesis long, and a [diatonic] semitone is 3 diesis long. That is,<br/>you get 5 steps between A and B (steps 23-28) and three diesis<br/>between E and F (10-13). In other words, diesis is a 31-edo<br/>equivalence for &quot;semitone&quot; used in the 12-edo scheme.</p><p>So, the five steps (dieses) between C and D, for instance, get named<br/>as C| C# Db D; (| and ; are ASCII equivalences for the more<br/>beautiful graphical semisharp and semiflat symbols).<br/>Sesquisharps and sesquiflats [sesqui=prefix for &quot;one and a half&quot;]<br/>can be written as #| and b; respectively. So, flat means &quot;two dieses<br/>lower in pitch&quot;, sharp &quot;two dieses higher&quot;, semiflat &quot;one diesis<br/>lower&quot;, sesquisharp &quot;three dieses higher&quot;, etc.</p><p>Then, C| is equivalent to Dbb, C# is equivalent to Db;, and so on.<br/>The diatonic semitone (E-F) is divided as E E| F; F, or if you wish,<br/>E Fb E# F.</p><p>[YA]  Thank you for an explanation of crystal clarity!</p><p>If my explanation is not enough, the guys at the Huygens-Fokker<br/>foundation have done a beautiful job at</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/index.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/index.html</a><br/>(under &quot;Theory&quot;)</p><p>There you can have a glimpse at the beautiful graphical symbols for<br/>|, ;, etc.</p><p>[YA]  I&apos;ll look for them.</p><p>As you may have noticed, Kraig has stated his preference for +/-<br/>instead of |/;. Greg asked our opinion about the simplified scheme C<br/>Dbb C# Db C## D.</p><p>&gt; BTW, I&apos;m perfectly happy to apply 31-tET to any style of music,<br/>&gt; whether diatonic, atonal (if such a thing truly exists; I agree with<br/>&gt; Monz that no music is devoid of harmonic, hence tonal, implications;<br/>&gt; perhaps we&apos;re better off sticking to the term &quot;serial&quot;?) or microtonal.<br/>&gt; I think that Kraig may have misunderstood me, and got the idea that<br/>&gt; I wanted everyone to use 31-et for diatonic music to the exclusion of<br/>&gt; microtonal music ...  That was never my intention.  If I could have<br/>&gt; expressed myself more clearly, I would have.  I would never knowingly<br/>&gt; slight another&apos;s chosen mode of self-expression; even when it&apos;s not<br/>&gt; my cup of tea, it may well be theirs ... and why should I start a storm<br/>&gt; in their tea-cup?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;<br/>Hum...
