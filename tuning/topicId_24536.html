It is what it<br/>is.  The errors only come in when you compare it to something else.  So<br/>it&apos;s up to *you* how many intervals you take.</p><p>For the case of tonality diamonds, though, you only need to take the<br/>ratios with a power of two on the bottom, so long as you do the<br/>calculation the right way.  Let&apos;s take the 7-limit, because that&apos;s nice<br/>and easy:</p><p>Ratio              JI            72-tET     error</p><p>1/1                 0.0            0.0       0.0<br/>3/2               702.0          700.0      -2.0<br/>5/4               386.3          383.3      -3.0<br/>7/4               968.8          966.7      -2.1</p><p>The worst 7-limit interval can be found by subtracting the lowest error<br/>from the highest.  So 0.0--3.0 = 3.0 cents.  So 72-tET is accurate to<br/>within 3 cents in the 7-limit.  Remember to preserve the signs of the<br/>errors for this calculation.</p><p>&gt; Am I to assume, also, that with &quot;blackjack,&quot; &quot;canasta&quot; or any of<br/>&gt; the &quot;subsets&quot; of the overall 72-tET the SAME error pertains??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or is that wrong, since there are a different total number of<br/>&gt; intervals in each of these scales?  It probably is wrong.</p><p>A 7:4 is always 58 steps of 72 whether it&apos;s used in blackjack, canasta or<br/>any other subset.  So the error will always be the same.  This happens to<br/>be true for any particular Miracle temperament.</p><p>&gt; If so, then what is the average error in cents of 72-tET, and the<br/>&gt; various &quot;Miracle&quot; families, &quot;blackjack&quot; and &quot;canasta&quot; in particular,<br/>&gt; and how would that be calculated again??</p><p>Averages are trickier, you do need to consider all intervals then.  The<br/>most popular is the root mean squared (RMS).  So you take the errors in<br/>all intervals, square them all, add them together and return the square<br/>root.  But I stay with the worst error, which tells me what I need to<br/>know.  The best Miracle temperament (near enough 72-tET) is accurate to<br/>3.3 cents of 11-limit JI.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=24543 href="#24543">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/8/2001 9:45:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24536.html#24540">/tuning/topicId_24536.html#24540</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; But still, to find an &quot;overall&quot; error estimation for 72-tET, how<br/>many<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals would we have to take??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You should read this article:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/realm.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/realm.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fokker went to the 13th harmonic in his comparison of ETs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was just wondering exactly how far off 72-tET actually *is* from<br/>&gt; &gt; just intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are different ways to evaluate this.

This is of course<br/>because the diatonic scale, as you and I understand it, &apos;hides&apos; the<br/>81:80. That&apos;s OK, John . . . Joseph is currently writing music using<br/>a scale (the blackjack scale) where the 81:80 never even occurs. All<br/>the chains of fifths are either two or three fifths long -- never<br/>longer -- and the 300-cent &apos;minor third&apos; resulting from three fifth<br/>is treated as dissonant, unlike the consonant 316-cent minor third<br/>you find more often in this scale . . . the blackjack scale &apos;hides&apos;<br/>the 224:225 and the 2400:2401 . . .

On the way to infinity, we simply think 72-tET is a<br/>particularly nice stopping point, with great 21- and 31-tone subsets<br/>that can be mapped to a composer&apos;s keyboard, and notational<br/>inflections that can be mastered by a good conservatory-trained<br/>performer in a reasonable amount of time.

As you may have seen, I got very upset when Monz tried to<br/>quantize Mozart&apos;s tuning to 72-tET -- the E-B fifth was 19 cents flat!</p></div><h3><a id=24574 href="#24574">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/8/2001 2:29:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24536.html#24564">/tuning/topicId_24536.html#24564</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s &quot;mean&quot; stuff....
