At a connection<br/>&gt;rate of 33.6Kbps (I average closer to 42Kbps) that would probably take<br/>&gt;somewhere around three seconds to download, including a lot of overhead.</p><p>Gary, you may be connected to your ISP at 42K/s, but when&apos;s the last time<br/>you got anything across the net faster than 3K/s?  I get 56.6 but seldom do<br/>better than 2K/s.</p><p>Telephone quality is not good enough for subtle differences in intonation.<br/>Barely making it is 22K/s with 16 bit samples, at which a 2 second sound<br/>byte would take almost 6 minutes to download at 2K/s.</p><p>Real audio is definitely not mp3.  Players for both formats are free, but<br/>encoders cost for both, unless you&apos;re willing to infringe on the mp3<br/>encoder patent.  Both do streaming, of course, but this isn&apos;t a concern on<br/>a list.</p><p>I have to agree with John ff, HTML is not acceptable for email.  Only MS<br/>mail, Netscape mail, and late-model versions of Eudora will even display<br/>it, to my knowledge.  If you&apos;re using &quot;wysiwyg&quot; editors to make the<br/>message, you can almost guarantee it will look like total crap, maybe even<br/>to somebody else on the same platform running the same software.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=205 href="#205">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@texas.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/1999 5:24:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Gary, you may be connected to your ISP at 42K/s, but when&apos;s the last time<br/>&gt; you got anything across the net faster than 3K/s?</p><p>   By the way, I just did some surfing around, and Netscape reported around<br/>1.8K per second.
