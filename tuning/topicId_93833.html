Call it a vague assumption...but it seems<br/>obvious to me the mind looks for overlapping patterns on a greater scale...and<br/>conforming to the harmonic series or a scale is only one such pattern.  Experts<br/>please correct me if you have a counter-example, but from what I hear jazz uses<br/>a whole lot of common themes/motifs, chord types, and parts of chords which stay<br/>constant whenever modulation of any sort is introduced to &quot;balance out the<br/>confusion&quot;.<br/>    For the same reason scales based on taking standard diatonic modes in 12TET<br/>and repeating on the 5th rather than the octave often seem to work well: you end<br/>up simply &quot;rotating the harmonic series along another axis&quot; and often end up<br/>revealing stronger tonalities toward certain root tones from the original scale<br/>in the process.  Then you can create &quot;major&quot; chords related to strength new<br/>tones in those chords and so on.  In the end of the day all the diatonic scale<br/>seems to be...is a scale that favors a few major chords as resting<br/>points...rotate those resting points (and do so gradually and not<br/>suddenly/wrecklessly) and you get loads of new possibilities that are<br/>surprisingly easy to listen to.   My guess is this doesn&apos;t apply just to 12TET<br/>either...but any tuning system which intentionally uses certain types of chords<br/>as musical resting points.</p></div><h3><a id=93839 href="#93839">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2010 4:18:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Any thoughts on how heavily-chromatic music manages to maintain a sense of tonal center?</p><p>Chord relationships is a good deal of it.</p></div><h3><a id=93843 href="#93843">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2010 5:10:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Igs</p><p>&gt; why is it that lots of jazz music, despite being chromatic<br/>&gt; as heck, does not sound atonal?</p><p>Because it uses consonant chords, in progressions connected<br/>by 5ths, or one or more common tones?</p><p>&gt; Even a minor-key authentic cadence of V-i temporarily shakes<br/>&gt; off the TsTTsTT structure of the Aeolian mode, a brief<br/>&gt; flirtation with a more chromatic (and decidedly non-MOS)<br/>&gt; structure.</p><p>Isn&apos;t it a brief flirtation with the aeolian mode of the<br/>same scale?</p><p>&gt; It appears to me that the presence of a tonal center does<br/>&gt; not depend on simple 7-10-note scales, generator chains,<br/>&gt; propriety, or any suchlike properties, but something all<br/>&gt; together more sophisticated</p><p>I&apos;d say the core of it is much less sophisticated -- the<br/>central role of consonant chord progressions.

There&apos;s plenty of<br/>popular music that uses dissonant chords.</p><p>(2) is primarily a melodic rule, and a lot of people won&apos;t like it.<br/>But then, you can get away with highly chromatic music, so simple<br/>scales aren&apos;t everything.</p><p>We get to real problems with (3).  People like repetition.  Take it<br/>away, and they&apos;ll find the melodies difficult to grasp.  But this gets<br/>missed when our hypothetical theorists talk about consonance and keys.<br/> The twelve tone method is supposed to bring back repetition, but it<br/>isn&apos;t in a form the overwhelming majority of listeners can grasp.</p><p>And then rule (4) is obviously melodic poison, especially when you<br/>apply it to short motifs.  It makes the tunes sound very strange to<br/>pretty much everybody.  I also don&apos;t see why you have to do this when<br/>you avoid tonality, but it&apos;s something the atonalists did.  It&apos;s<br/>something you can get used to but it presents a surface very different<br/>from the tonal one.</p><p>Now, I&apos;m not more an expert on tonality than atonality, but since you<br/>call me on it I&apos;ll explain.  If we&apos;re talking about the very complex<br/>system that arose in the late 18th century, then yes, chords are<br/>important to that.  But the average listener doesn&apos;t understand a lot<br/>of these rules.  And the average listener won&apos;t be aware of them in<br/>the way an experienced musician in the field will.  Also the concept<br/>of &quot;chords&quot; is itself a fluid one.  You can define them as notes being<br/>played at the same time, but then theorists will take a naked melody<br/>and analyze it in terms of the implied chords.  Then they&apos;ll simplify<br/>the notes that are actually being played at the same time to allow for<br/>some notes being outside the chord.  So chords become, to a large<br/>extent, a tool for theorists to encode the rules of tonality, and<br/>label them &quot;harmony&quot;.</p><p>The concept of chords is one of the great inventions of European<br/>theory.  It&apos;s also a concept that doesn&apos;t arise in, or apply to,<br/>musics from other cultures.  In many cases, tunes are written in such<br/>a way that they can easily be harmonized, and even make sense in terms<br/>of chord progressions.  This can be explained by the use of diatonic<br/>scales and tonics and so on.  But it isn&apos;t always like that.  The<br/>rules that seem to apply across cultures are: repeat notes, use small<br/>(but not too small) melodic steps, and establish conventions that<br/>listeners can follow.  There are researchers looking at how this last<br/>rule applies to tonality, which isn&apos;t simple, and Krumhansl summarizes<br/>their work.</p><p>When you have chords, there is a general preference for consonance.<br/>There&apos;s a tendency for international folk music to be harmonized in a<br/>very sugary way.  People must like it.  I think it does go across<br/>cultures.  But it isn&apos;t an important part of music for many people.<br/>I&apos;ll even say that the more important harmony is, the more tendency<br/>there is to move away from simple consonance and towards something<br/>more interesting.  You can see this in the great 19th Century<br/>romantics, and also in jazz.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=93938 href="#93938">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2010 1:48:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote;</p><p>&gt;&gt; 3) Avoid repetition of notes, or octave equivalents, within a<br/>&gt;&gt; short time scale.<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; We get to real problems with (3).

Like, synonymous<br/>with &quot;functional harmony&quot; (though I don&apos;t think the &quot;functions&quot;<br/>are quite so dependent on the diatonic scale as usually implied<br/>in the lit, and view that as a convenience / failure to<br/>generalize owing to the monopoly status of the diatonic scale).</p><p>Oh, here&apos;s something I wrote to a friend last year:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Here&apos;s my piano reduction:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/temp/ComeSirrahJack.pdf">http://lumma.org/temp/ComeSirrahJack.pdf</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s kind of right on the border between modal and tonal music.<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s mostly tonal, but the use of both DM and Dmin, and<br/>&gt;&gt; AM and Amin here sounds a bit odd to our ears.  Also the<br/>&gt;&gt; downward fifths in the bass at the top is a bit weird.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s interesting to me whether they were doing it &apos;on purpose&apos;,<br/>&gt;&gt; or whether they just hadn&apos;t quite figured it out yet.  IOW,<br/>&gt;&gt; whether they would have used a more tonal style had they known<br/>&gt;&gt; about it, or whether this constituted a style of its own, and<br/>&gt;&gt; the more modern way of doing things would have been heard as<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;wrong&apos; to them.  I tend to suspect the former.  I suppose<br/>&gt;&gt; a third option is that they already had the more tonal style<br/>&gt;&gt; and the higher-end madrigal composers like Weelkes were doing<br/>&gt;&gt; it intentionally to be clever.
