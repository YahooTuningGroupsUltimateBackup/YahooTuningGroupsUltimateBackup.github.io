This will comprise concerts of microtonal<br/>music together with lectures and presentations and it is hoped that it will<br/>become an annual event.  Performers will include duo Contour (trumpet and<br/>percussion, Germany), Rare Bird (Rachel Barnes and Natasha Powell<br/>recorders, UK), Robin Michael (&apos;cello, UK) and Elisabeth Smalt (viola and<br/>adapted viola, the Netherlands).  Speakers will include Dr Bob Gilmore<br/>(author of Harry Partch&apos;s biography and Reader in Musicology at Dartington<br/>College of Arts, UK), Dr Christopher Fox (composer, academic and author),<br/>Dr Miekko Kanno (violinist and lecturer at the University of Durham) and<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low (composer and Director of the Centre for New Musical<br/>Instruments, UK).  In addition Microtonal Projects Ltd would like to<br/>propose a call for &apos;window&apos; sessions which are devised to demonstrate the<br/>range and depth of microtonal interest in the UK.</p><p>UK MicroFest 1, &apos;Window&apos; Sessions<br/>Window sessions can last for between 5 and 15 minutes and could present any<br/>of the following, although other ideas are welcome:<br/>1) a microtonal work or group of works given by the composer (using live,<br/>or CD examples)<br/>2) research into microtonality (intonation, tuning systems etc.)<br/>3) microtonal performance possibilities (research-based or demonstration)<br/>4) new instruments (ideas for ..., prototypes, performances on ... )<br/>5) microtonal electro-acoustic works (extracts or whole pieces)</p><p>There will be 2 sessions of up to an hour and a half devoted to the window<br/>sessions depending on response.  These will be introduced by Patrick<br/>Ozzard-Low.  The purpose of the window sessions will be to offer an<br/>opportunity to present work and ideas which are fresh and relevant to<br/>microtonality.  They are intended to be snapshots only: there will be other<br/>opportunities to present more extended work on the Microtonal Projects<br/>website or at future Microtonal Projects events.  Proposals (stating a<br/>suggested, accurate time allocation), biographies, CDs (if relevant) should<br/>be sent to Microtonal Projects Ltd, 75 Canbury Avenue, Kingston upon<br/>Thames, Surrey KT2 6JR or emailed to:<br/><a href="mailto:microfest@microtonalprojects.co.uk">microfest@microtonalprojects.co.uk</a><br/>Deadline for submissions: Friday 3 December, 2004</p><p><a href="http://www.donaldbousted.co.uk">http://www.donaldbousted.co.uk</a><br/><a href="http://www.microtonalprojects.co.uk">http://www.microtonalprojects.co.uk</a></p></div>
