Currently it seems to take 3 to four days<br/>for new items to appear. I have received several good comments on the<br/>new Kraig Grady pieces there.<br/>    I will ask again, since I didn&apos;t get any responses to the last<br/>query. Does anyone have the program notes for the Denis Atadan tape<br/>swap? I cannot find mine, and I am trying to straighten out who is who<br/>on that music.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>9/14/2000 2:15:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Starrett wrote:</p><p>&gt;     I will ask again, since I didn&apos;t get any responses to the last<br/>&gt; query.
