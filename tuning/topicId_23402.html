<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Thanks to the list</h1><h3><a id=23402 href="#23402">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 9:59:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Tuning List,</p><p>I just received a package in the post from Dave Cope which reminded me that<br/>I haven&apos;t thanked the tuning list following the successful showing of Andy<br/>FilleBrown&apos;s and my tumbling dekany (entitled &quot;Polyhedron&quot;) to an audience<br/>of about 100, at Cope&apos;s &apos;April in Santa Cruz&apos; Festival of Contemporary Music.</p><p>See the new page I made for it<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/StereoDekany.htm">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/StereoDekany.htm</a></p><p>Since I couldn&apos;t be there (owing to a lot of intervening ocean). Dave Cope<br/>was kind enough to mail me a copy of the printed program for the<br/>&apos;Algorithmic Shorts&apos; concert and a pair of the 3D glases that were handed<br/>out. Our piece was run at both the opening and the closing of the concert.<br/>My good friend Dick Von Herzen was the &quot;performer&quot;, connecting his notebook<br/>computer to the UCSC Recital Hall sound system and video projector.</p><p>If you&apos;d asked me two years ago if I&apos;d ever achieve something like this, I<br/>would have said never in a million years. Me, the mathematician, the only<br/>non-musician on the tuning list. :-)</p><p>It only came about as a direct result of the kinds of discussions on the<br/>list that involve mathematics and/or lattices. And in particular Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s explanation of Wilson&apos;s combination Product Sets. Without that, I<br/>could have looked at Wilson&apos;s diagrams on Kraig Grady&apos;s website for a<br/>million years and had nothing to show for it but a headache. (Valuable<br/>service though it is, Kraig).</p><p>And of course if I hadn&apos;t been on the list I would never have met Andy to<br/>help me turn my ideas into reality.</p><p>So I&apos;d like to thank everyone who contributed, even if it was just to<br/>comment on an early version.</p><p>And I&apos;d like to encourage folks: If you don&apos;t understand how some math<br/>someone posts relates to making music, then please ask for further<br/>explanation. Keep us honest. Don&apos;t let us drift off into our own world of<br/>jargon. And if you&apos;re not interested in the math at all, then please accept<br/>that there are many who are. And it does lead to music, eventually.</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
