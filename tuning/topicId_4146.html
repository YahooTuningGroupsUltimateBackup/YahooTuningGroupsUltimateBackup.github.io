The short answer is that<br/>Javanese metallophones are tempered so that each _pathet_ (more or less<br/>equivalent to the well-tempered idea of _key_) is recognizeable and playable<br/>with voices and instruments without fixed pitch. Further, there are auxillary<br/>pitches (&quot;miring&quot; or &quot;minir&quot;) used in slendro which are variously represented<br/>as either like western chromatic alterations or borrowings from a parallel<br/>pelog scale.</p><p>How many pitches does that add up to? It depends upon how you count them. Do<br/>you count beating unisons or stretched or shrunken octaves as separate<br/>pitches? What about the differences between fixed and variable pitched<br/>intervals, or from one gamelan to another?  Most Javanese musicians will<br/>probably think in terms of 11 abstract pitches total (5 slendro + 6<br/>additional pelog pitches), while smaller differences between pitches probably<br/>fall into the category of _embat_, or individual style.</p><p>At this point in time, it is safe to disregard Mantle Hood&apos;s writings<br/>altogether.  For a general introduction to pitch vocabularies, nothing is<br/>better than Martopangrawit&apos;s articles in volume 1 of _Karawitan_. The best<br/>contemporary account of Javanese tuning practice, and a critique of American<br/>just intonation gamelan, is by Marc Perlman.  Larry Polansky has written some<br/>valuable articles on slendro, and my own article on Pelog in XH is<br/>speculative music theory, not ethnomusicology, as are Erv Wilson&apos;s<br/>meta-slendro and meta-pelog proposals.</p><p>The 19 tones Hood mentioned to J. Reinhard sound more like Sundanese theory<br/>to me. Rothenberg was similarly confused in his use of data from his main<br/>informant Bernhard Ijzendraat Suryabrata.  A good summary of the Sundanese<br/>theoretical tradition -- which has gone through a long series of attempts,<br/>both theoretical and practical, to integrate all of the sundanese scales into<br/>a single tuning -- is in Andrew Weintraub&apos;s UCB dissertation.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div>
