But every vibrating string or<br/>struck bar has a fundamental and I&apos;m happy that my strobe tuner is finding it and tuning it<br/>perfectly ( to 0.1 cent) on a zither or steel tube marimba. The inharmonic partials with the<br/>zither at least are so weak that they don&apos;t matter in pitch recognition though to my ears they<br/>enhance or indeed define the timbre. At some point we must surely have to get down and work with<br/>an instrument, inharmonic partials or not.</p><p>&gt; (2) an inevitable tradeoff between getting the fundamentals in tune<br/>&gt; and getting the overtones in tune (due to the inharmonicity of the<br/>&gt; strings)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (b) if you know what imprecision you&apos;re willing to tolerate (even if<br/>&gt; it&apos;s as small as 0.1 cent), you can &quot;target&quot; certain<br/>&gt; microtemperaments (not necessarily equal), and you will be more<br/>&gt; likely to end up with a larger number of intervals and chords that<br/>&gt; pass your criterion for &quot;justness&quot;, than if you simply &quot;targeted&quot; a<br/>&gt; just scale.</p><p>But I can&apos;t get a better 1/1 - 7/6 - 4/3 - 3/2 - 7/4 - 2/1 other than by using those tones. An ET<br/>would be pointless. I&apos;d end up with more tones than I need and less precision.</p><p>&gt; dave keenan has discussed the latter quite a bit, so you might want<br/>&gt; to contact him (i think he&apos;s still following the tuning-math list)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; anyway, alison, did i miss something? did you end up doing some<br/>&gt; direct comparisons and deciding that the intervals and chords in 72-<br/>&gt; equal were too far from just for you? if so, i&apos;d like to know that,<br/>&gt; and you can rest assured that i&apos;ll never mention 72-equal to you<br/>&gt; again!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Not at all. I love working with the subsets of 72 that you and others have so skilfully explored.<br/>I love the whole and the parts, the precisions and the imprecisions. At the moment I simply happen<br/>to be up to the eyes in JI slendros and pelogs and hearing things I&apos;ve never heard before. When I<br/>get round to finishing what I started in 72 I&apos;ll be listening with fresh ears, for modulation,<br/>voice leading and the like but also for &quot;suggestive&quot; tones and I&apos;ll report what I hear.</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 11:38:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; An ET would be pointless.

You are not<br/>interested in high number ET&apos;s<br/>&gt; then what is 612?</p><p>i never proposed 612, in fact i tried to explain what i saw in gene&apos;s<br/>proposal that had nothing to do with any equal temperament or with<br/>612 notes per se. didn&apos;t you get it? from your response, it seemed<br/>that you had . . .</p><p>&gt; I continue you find Yours, Genes, and Grahams relentless in push<br/>&gt;612 down Alison&apos;s JI scale.</p><p>what on earth are you talking about? did i even mention 612 to<br/>alison??</p><p>&gt; what<br/>&gt; could possibly be gained by proposing 612 temperment on a 10 tone<br/>&gt;scale. Am i really missing<br/>&gt; something?.</p><p>as i explained before, the 10 tone scale in question gains more<br/>almost-pure consonances when certain commas are tempered out. 612-<br/>equal is only one example of such a tuning, just as 31-equal is only<br/>one example of a meantone tuning. in general, though, such tunings<br/>are not closed/finite -- nor are they just.</p><p>we&apos;ve been down this road before, also to the point of mutual<br/>understanding -- i thought. remember those color blackjust lattices<br/>which showed the 21-tone ji scale and the &quot;wolves&quot; they contain? you<br/>remarked that you liked how the lattice showed the mistuned<br/>consonances and that you&apos;d like to retain those &quot;wolves&quot; to use them<br/>for position-finding and for their own unique characteristics. i<br/>appreciated that, meanwhile others would prefer to &quot;tame the wolves&quot;<br/>and use a miracle temperament. 72-equal is an *example* of a tuning<br/>supporting miracle temperament. but it&apos;s still only a 21-tone scale.<br/>joseph is now working on his third (?) composition in this scale. so<br/>if he says he&apos;s using 72-equal, are you going to castigate him for it?</p><p>maintaining hope,<br/>paul</p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2002 6:35:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; But I can&apos;t get a better 1/1 - 7/6 - 4/3 - 3/2 - 7/4 - 2/1 other<br/>than by using those tones.
