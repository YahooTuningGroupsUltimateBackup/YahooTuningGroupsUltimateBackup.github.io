Thanks for spelling it<br/>out so neatly. Retaining the &quot;conventional open string configuration<br/>of +4th +4th+ 4th+3rd+4th in 17 EDO&quot; means being able to work from<br/>conventional chord fingerings, working in the &apos;extra&apos; five notes.</p><p>I like how 17-TET/EDO fits so neatly, essentially retaining the diatonic<br/>scale and offering two alternatives for each accidental. Like<br/>one set of white keys, and two choices of black keys.</p><p>I think someone mentioned something about Bosanquet having thought<br/>of 17-TET rather favourably.</p><p>&gt;*As far as acronyms go, {E}quidistant {D}ivision of the {O}ctave&#xFFFD;s&#xFFFD; EDO,<br/>&gt;certainly seems (to me) a rather colorless creation (immanently indisposed<br/>&gt;as it is to the oddly resonant charm of {T}one {E}qual {T}emperament&#xFFFD;s&#xFFFD;TET),<br/>&gt;but I do believe it &apos;better says&apos; what (I believe) &apos;needs saying&apos;&#xFFFD;</p><p>Oh yeah, I like this EDO thing. It is more to the point. ET = equal<br/>temperament, and n-cet, EDO, etc. would be the different varieties.</p><p>&gt;and as such I feel somewhat obligated to continue to pretend I like it<br/>&gt;(and apologize for saying so).<br/>No way. Like it. This is the first I&apos;ve heard of &quot;EDO&quot;, and I&apos;m sold.</p><p>BTW #1 : Debra,something (maybe the font/character set you&apos;re using)<br/>         is causing some characters (quotation marks &amp; apostrophes<br/>         for example) to show up rather strangely.</p><p>BTW #2 : It&apos;s great that the list is back and all, and I don&apos;t mean to<br/>         gripe,  but I just switched to digest mode, and it arrives as<br/>         a text attachment. Rats ! But it&apos;s o.k.</p><p>BTW #3 : I found this site featuring koto &amp; shakuhachi compositions<br/>         by Inada-no-Umahijiri. It&apos;s not microtonal, but certainly feels<br/>         like it could use some xen (get it...? :-()<br/>         &lt;<a href="http://www2a.biglobe.ne.jp/~village/zca.htm">http://www2a.biglobe.ne.jp/~village/zca.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>Ole !</p><p>- Drew</p></div>
