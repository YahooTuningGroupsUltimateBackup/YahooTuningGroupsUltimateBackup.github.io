Although my personal feeling is that this method is<br/>more of a salve to the lazy and guilty conscience, I nevertheless feel that<br/>our government&apos;s present punk stances toward Iraq and world cooperation in<br/>general is so outrageous that _anything we can do to raise awareness of the<br/>need to do something of a more concreet nature is probably a good thing.<br/>&gt;Delivered-To: <a href="mailto:jaywill@tscnet.com">jaywill@tscnet.com</a><br/>&gt;To: Other Minds List &lt;<a href="mailto:othermindslist@otherminds.org">othermindslist@otherminds.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;From: Charles Amirkhanian &lt;<a href="mailto:charles@artsplural.com">charles@artsplural.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: [Othermindslist] TERRY RILEY EVENT LIVE ON INTERNET OCT 2<br/>&gt;Date: Fri, 6 Sep 2002 00:07:16 -0700<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;From: Terry Riley &lt;<a href="mailto:tmril@earthlink.net">tmril@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;DEAR FRIENDS,<br/>&gt;In my growing concern over the current administration&apos;s threats to invade<br/>&gt;Iraq I found myself having to do something as a daily practice to, in a<br/>&gt;small way, contribute to world peace.  I began doing late night piano and<br/>&gt;vocal meditations which I projected as Protection Vigils.  My first<br/>&gt;intention was to protect innocent peoples in Iraq from the savage bombing<br/>&gt;and attacks that NOW SEEM eminent from the US forces.  Later I used them in<br/>&gt;the service of friends who were very ill or who had recently died. Then came<br/>&gt;vigils which were extended to protect the whole planet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I mentioned THESE VIGILS to Mikail Graham who got excited by the idea and we<br/>&gt;discussed the possibility of turning it into a community ritual led by local<br/>&gt;artists, dancers, musicians and masters of the spoken word. Mikail Graham<br/>&gt;then contacted Utah Phillips who also got behind the idea adding his own<br/>&gt;inimitable energies and now it has sprung into being with a plan to host the<br/>&gt;all night event at the Miners foundry IN NEVEDA CITY CALIFORNIA on Oct. 2<br/>&gt;with a live broadcast of the entire event on KVMR. (Also hear it on the<br/>&gt;World Wide Web at <a href="http://kvmr.org">kvmr.org</a>) The event will take place from 7PM to 7AM and<br/>&gt;will be called A.W.A.K.E.<br/>&gt;We invite friends everywhere to join with us in this peace effort on this<br/>&gt;special night or at any time.<br/>&gt;                                  A.W.A.K.E.<br/>&gt;Please come and give up a nights sleep to be AWAKE with us and join in a<br/>&gt;rapturous community ritual to participate in A NIGHT OF PEACEFUL VIGILANCE<br/>&gt;IN MUSIC AND DANCE, VISUALIZATIONS AND THE SPOKEN WORD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;AS THE NIGHT unfolds WE INTEND TO WEAVE THE BEGININNGS STRANDS OF PROTECTION<br/>&gt;TO BENEFIT ALL THE EARTH AND HER LIVING CREATURES.  TO BRING TO OUR<br/>&gt;GATHERING A CONSCIOUS INTENTION TO MERGE WITH THE UNIVERSAL WILL TOWARDS<br/>&gt;BEAUTY WITH HUMILITY AND ARTISTRY.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;IN PEACE,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Terry Riley<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;_______________________________________________<br/>&gt;Othermindslist mailing list<br/>&gt;<a href="mailto:Othermindslist@otherminds.org">Othermindslist@otherminds.org</a><br/>&gt;<a href="http://otherminds.org/mailman/listinfo/othermindslist_otherminds.org">http://otherminds.org/mailman/listinfo/othermindslist_otherminds.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
