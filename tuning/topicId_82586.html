My first inspiration were the Master Musicians of Tanzania with the lead singer Hukwe Zawose. Almost all of their music was played in harmonic 5-tone scales like 6:7:8:9:10:12. So this was the first idea for retuning my kalimba - I used two copies of this scale an octave apart. Later? I used 5-limit JI sets of triadic combinations like, for instance, E-G-A-B-D-E-F#-G-B-D-E. Even later, I invited other TL members to join in. Graham suggested a harmonic scale of 6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15:16. I made a small piece of music with that and then I made another one with another harmonic &quot;extract&quot;, ranging from 5 to 15. Then, Herman suggested to try mavila so I took the 5-tone mavila scale and used two, one octave apart. If you want to know more, I can find the recordings and tell you what you ask.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=82588 href="#82588">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2009 1:39:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>PS: BTW, Daniel Forr&oacute; was the one who bought the kalimba for me ...

I haven&apos;t any suggestion concerning<br/>tuning. Just do whatever you like and what&apos;s possible, you did well.<br/>You know my experimental nature, so I don&apos;t think ethnic instruments<br/>must be tuned the same way like it&apos;s usual in the country of their<br/>origin. But certainly there are some physical limitations done by the<br/>construction.</p><p>Some time ago I have started to experiment with tunings on my two<br/>kotos and culturally shock my Japanese friends, koto players with<br/>microtones :-) They all are so deeply obedient to their gurus and<br/>closed in their tradition that such sins are unimaginable to them.<br/>They use only Japanese scales, or diatonic, rarely some other modes<br/>in contemporary works, and tune with the help of digital tuner so<br/>result is approximately 12 ET (we perform often together, I play<br/>piano or synthesizer, so it&apos;s in tune, so-so). Never mind, anytime I<br/>can pretend just to be only stupid gaijin :-) Probably I will come to<br/>the buddhistic hell jigoku one day. But it&apos;s pretty interesting evenon the standard 13 string koto. Japanese don&apos;t take care about the<br/>left part of the string, and when used in some modern compositions,<br/>only for detuned sound effect, tuning is random and on every koto<br/>different. It would be great to try to change the total tension of<br/>the string that the relation in tuning L:R would be part of the<br/>tuning system. That way 26 tones would be usable! Hopefully I find a<br/>way to explain it to the koto technician. But it would be not so easy<br/>because of construction and binding the strings (there are no tuning<br/>pegs on standard koto). Therefore I&apos;m trying to get 17 or more string<br/>instrument, they have pegs additionally to shifting bridges.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 4 Apr 2009, at 5:39 AM, Petr Par&iacute;zek wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS: BTW, Daniel Forr&oacute; was the one who bought the kalimba for me ...<br/>&gt; Daniel, any suggestions on your side?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr</p></div><h3><a id=82597 href="#82597">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2009 8:19:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Johnson wrote:<br/>&gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt; &gt; My wife and I picked up a pair (alto and soprano) Hugh Tracey kalimbas &gt; on Sunday.<br/>&gt; &gt; I tuned them briefly to a quasi 7-equal, and was sick of that pretty &gt; quickly.

I like to use mavila tunings, which have the opposite pattern of major and minor thirds compared with the diatonic scale. Porcupine would also be an interesting alternative. But neither of those temperaments have a half-step-sized interval in their 7-note scales...</p><p>Diatonic:        Mavila:          Porcupine:</p><p>C D E F G A B    C D E F G A B    C D E F G A B<br/>E F G A B C D    E F G A B C D    E F G A B C D<br/>M m m M M m m    m M M m m M M    m m m M M m m</p><p>Or you could look for scales with different patterns of large and small steps. Wilson&apos;s golden horogram no. 11, labeled &quot;Lucas&quot;, looks interesting, with its 3 small steps of 126.69 cents and 4 large steps of 204.98 cents.</p></div><h3><a id=82598 href="#82598">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2009 12:48:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote:</p><p>&gt; Porcupine would also be an interesting alternative.</p><p>I never thought of that.
