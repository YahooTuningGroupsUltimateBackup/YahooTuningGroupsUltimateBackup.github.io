As a kid, I would always stop to listen keenly when I heard a<br/>choir, especially a barbershop one.  I remember asking why they sounded<br/>different.  When I first started listening to YES, I thought the vocals<br/>were really something to hear (I must have been factoring out Steve Howe :)</p><p>When I first heard 11-limit hexads (on an Ivor/Genovese slide guitar), I<br/>was blown away by the subtlety and power of the sensations I was getting.<br/>When I got Dave Hill&apos;s The Sounds of Just Intonation, I was happy to hear<br/>somebody else talk about this, and to relate the experience of the higher<br/>limits to what it must have been like for Europeans hearing the first<br/>5-limit choirs.</p><p>At the keyboard I&apos;ve had plenty of exposure to 12, and comparing to 5-limit<br/>just, it&apos;s like the difference between a hostess cupcake and a mango.<br/>Eating the cupcake, you think it&apos;s delicious.  But try the mango, and the<br/>flat, one-track flavor of the cupcake is unthinkable.  Man, I love mangos.</p><p>Getting back on track, these are just words I use to describe how it sounds<br/>to me.  I think Mark Nowitsky once agreed that the 7/4 sounded like a<br/>flourescent light.  The 11 seems to add a lush, tropical sound to the pentad.</p><p>[Morrison]<br/>&gt;That very closely coincides with my impressions of those prime factors.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty impressed by the ability of language to communicate these<br/>things.  That is, if forced to answer the &quot;do other people see red&quot;<br/>question, I&apos;d say yes.  I think this stuff sounds the same, more or less,<br/>to most of us.</p><p>I remember in &quot;theory&quot; class, our AI described the augmented triad as<br/>spacey and the perfect fourth/fifth as square.  I thought this was right on.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=1356 href="#1356">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/1999 4:59:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;That very closely coincides with my impressions of those prime factors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m pretty impressed by the ability of language to communicate these<br/>&gt; things.</p><p>   By the way, another word I use to describe 7s (Carl said &quot;flourescent<br/>lightingness&quot;) is that 7-based intervals have a certain &quot;zap&quot; to them.</p></div>
