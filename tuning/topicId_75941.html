Octave shift is one of the<br/>strongest symmetries in music, and just randomly shifting<br/>each pitch in a famous melody by -1, 0, +1 octaves will<br/>quickly demonstrate its limitations.  Alongside transposition<br/>is modal transposition (in the diatonic scale, for example),<br/>which is a much more common and arguably much more fundamental<br/>symmetry in Western music.</p><p>On page 3 it is suggested that chords can be explained in<br/>terms of octave, permutation, and cardinality invariance.<br/>No mention of psychoacoustic consonance, as is typical of<br/>the kinds of academic music theory papers that normally do<br/>not appear in Science.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2008 2:53:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Tymoczko is really quite a brilliant guy and I think his work is important (some of his small items on the SMT list are really interesting, particularly in voice leading) but I agree here with Carl that it&apos;s very strange for this to appear in Science instead of a music theory platform.</p><p>&quot;Western musicians traditionally classify pitch sequences by<br/>disregarding the effects of five musical transformations:<br/>octave shift, permutation, transposition, inversion, and<br/>cardinality change.&quot;</p><p>Some of these are true if we step back to the most trivial cases: musicians (and most lay listeners) will recognize a melody as the same if it is played in different octaves, but dropping or lifting isolated tones out of the melody will likely render a melody unrecognizeable;  permutation of the tones in an arpeggiated chord usually preserves chordal identity; transposition, like octave shift, will preserve the identity if the transposition is applied to the entire sequence.

I could understand him getting one paper published on the geometry, because it&apos;s a fairly simple concept that&apos;s original and may be of interest to scientists.  I&apos;m not sure what this new paper adds that isn&apos;t obvious.  They barely talk about music.  I don&apos;t think anything&apos;s of mathematical interest.  And it isn&apos;t science.   All they do is, as they say, define the language.  It&apos;s a good work-horse type paper that should be published somewhere, but not as the second ever piece of music theory in a prestigious science journal.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Western musicians traditionally classify pitch sequences by<br/>&gt; disregarding the effects of five musical transformations:<br/>&gt; octave shift, permutation, transposition, inversion, and<br/>&gt; cardinality change.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some of these are true if we step back to the most trivial cases:  &gt; musicians (and most lay listeners) will recognize a melody as the same if  &gt; it is played in different octaves, but dropping or lifting isolated tones  &gt; out of the melody will likely render a melody unrecognizeable;   &gt; permutation of the tones in an arpeggiated chord usually preserves chordal  &gt; identity; transposition, like octave shift, will preserve the identity if  &gt; the transposition is applied to the entire sequence.

There&apos;s a table on page 57 of the free PDF that says what means what.  They don&apos;t say all the transformations have to be equivalent all the time.  The trouble is they don&apos;t say very much at all...</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2008 4:48:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>He is a music theorist though.<br/>I sense he is attempting to lay the groundwork of some type of unified field theory of harmony and melody.
