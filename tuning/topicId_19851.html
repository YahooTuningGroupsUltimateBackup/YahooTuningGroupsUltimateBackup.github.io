I think probably so...</p><p>Q. Why does the 12 tone scale have 12 notes, and why are there &quot;black<br/>and white&quot; keys on the piano?</p><p>A. Our &quot;common&quot; 12 note system, such as one would see on a modern<br/>piano,  stems from a &quot;Pythagorean&quot; system which uses a string of<br/>&quot;pure,&quot; (unbeating) fifths.  This system was developed in the Middle<br/>Ages, in response to the use of pure fifths as a basic consonance.</p><p>A cycle of fifths will go &quot;once around&quot; 11 times before, eventually,<br/>approximating an octave at the 12th fifth.  (It doesn&apos;t quiteÂ…<br/>see &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot;)</p><p>If one were to transpose the pitches of this chain to within one<br/>octave, one gets the 12 notes we presently use.  The &quot;closest&quot; fifths<br/>to the starting point were given &quot;white&quot; keys and those further away<br/>and generally less used, were given &quot;black keys.&quot;</p></div>
