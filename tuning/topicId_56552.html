Maybe this is because 3:2 is such a<br/>simple interval, and modulating by it can easily be done without throwing<br/>fixed scale notes from low-numbered to high-numbered ratios, i.e. without<br/>requiring a larger fixed scale.  All the usual comments about how 5-limit<br/>and 12-tone go well together.  And 3:2 is even less demanding than 5:4 in<br/>terms of stressing modulation to the point of breaking a simple scale (or<br/>maybe I should say tuning), making it require more notes to be useful.</p><p>So, if you take this as a given, then the original observation falls out of<br/>the tonal facts of modulation by fifths.  A semitone down from the tonic is<br/>very likely the 15/8 which is just the 3rd above the 5th above the tonic.  A<br/>semitone up from the tonic is nothing special, nothing close in the cycle of<br/>5ths, unless you get into 11-limit.  So with more use of 11-limit you might<br/>find downward resolution to the tonic to be more common.  Lacking 11-limit<br/>you&apos;re either dealing with a modulation that is somewhat less common in<br/>order to support that melodic movement (e.g. a modulation from A major to C<br/>major, supporting the C# to C melodic transition while remaining in 5-limit<br/>harmony), or you are dealing with the semitone above the tonic playing a<br/>more dissonant role.  Even in 11-limit you might consider it more dissonant,<br/>e.g. modulating from G major to C major to support the C# to C movement with<br/>the C# being the 11/8 in G.</p><p>&gt; 2) Can we extend this rule to the others intervals? For example it<br/>&gt; is possible to say that a tone tends to resolve downwards?</p><p>I think what you were getting at above is that a given melodic interval from<br/>a given *destination* (resolved) tone may tend to come from a particular<br/>direction, which is a little different from saying that a given tone tends<br/>to *go* in a particular direction.  This is just to be clear.  I think both<br/>are valid questions, but they are two separate questions, at least for<br/>starters.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2005 6:15:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 1/3/05 11:23 AM, wallyesterpaulrus &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; on 1/1/05 4:18 PM, lorenzofrizzera &lt;lorenzo.frizzera@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve read this in a post regarding bach and ragas:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While there can be a chromatic leading tone downward towards a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tonic, it is more usual to have one pointing up to the tonic.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) why?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So, if you take this as a given, then the original observation<br/>&gt; falls out of<br/>&gt;&gt; the tonal facts of modulation by fifths.
