The taxicab metric can be likened to a<br/>different &quot;route&quot; in which planes of the lattice representing the<br/>combinations of (in the rectangular lattice) any two prime-factors or<br/>(in the triangular lattice) any two basic-intervals, are divided up<br/>into rectangular or triangular &quot;blocks&quot; like those of a typical city<br/>street pattern. The taxicab can&apos;t travel along the straight Euclidean<br/>line, but instead must travel along the individual &quot;streets&quot; of the<br/>prime or basic-interval axes. &quot;</p><p>except that in the triangular lattice, each plane has three basic<br/>intervals, not two.</p><p>the other stuff doesn&apos;t look correct to me. the taxicab metric<br/>provides, like the euclidean metric, a *single number* for the<br/>distance between any two pitches. not a list of exponents or anything<br/>like that. the &quot;kernel&quot; simply refers to any complete basis for the<br/>temperament or finity. you may be thinking of the TM-reduced basis,<br/>which simply means that choice of kernel in which the basis vectors<br/>are the shortest possible taxicab length in the Tenney rectangular<br/>lattice. it&apos;s called &quot;TM&quot; after Tenney and Minkowski -- the latter<br/>came up with the procedure for basis reduction.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2002 5:11:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; the &quot;kernel&quot; simply refers to any complete basis for the<br/>&gt; temperament or finity.</p><p>sorry -- that would simply be a &quot;basis&quot; -- the &quot;kernel&quot; actually<br/>refers to the entire, infinite set of unison vectors for the<br/>temperament</p><p>&gt; you may be thinking of the TM-reduced basis,<br/>&gt; which simply means that choice of kernel in which the basis<br/>vectors<br/>&gt; are the shortest possible taxicab length in the Tenney<br/>rectangular<br/>&gt; lattice.</p><p>that should be the choice of basis, not the choice of kernel!</p></div>
