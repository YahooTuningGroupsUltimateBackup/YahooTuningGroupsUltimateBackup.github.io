A scale, to me, is a set of tones that are interrelated not only to one another in some way, but to other sets as well. The scale sets here are slices of the infinity of tonal possiblities. In my view, harmonics and subharmonics are both integral to the tonal fabric and the scales here reflect that view.</p><p>  I like this first one because it incorporates lots of sevens and can be full of dissonance or quite sweet, depending on the desired result. It is also, I think, a possible 7-limit interpretation/extrapolation of the melodic minor. I am showing the relative just ratios in a row of triads to highlight that interpretation.</p><p>  The ascending 6th and 7th are shown in brackets (as is the ascending octave triad.) The descending octave triad is a harmonic 5-6-7.</p><p>  5/4   4/3      3/2   5/3   7/4   2/1 (2/1)   21/10 (20/9)     7/3 (5/2)<br/>  1/1   10/9    5/4   4/3   3/2   5/3 (5/3)   7/4     (40/21)   2/1 (2/1)<br/>  5/6    20/21 1/1 10/9   5/4   4/3 (10/7) 3/2     100/63)  5/3 (5/3)<br/>  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>  The next 12 tone mappable scale is one I originally submitted to this list as the &apos;intersection of sets&apos; scale a few years back. It is the intersection of the 7-limit n:n+1 harmonic/subharmonic relationships of 1/1 and 3/2. There are two conjoined 8-tone scales sharing the bold faced intervals.
