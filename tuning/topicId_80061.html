While these effects are not present in an inital signal, non-linearities in the systems through which we receive sounds (resonators, loudspeakers, ears, etc.) will inevitably create them.  (For example, create a sound file with two sines in a 3:2 relationship; compare FFTs run on the sound file alone and on a recording of the sound played through loudspeakers in a real room.)

This is, ultimately, a missing fundamental model, in that, simple interval-by-simple interval it seeks to resolve a tone complex as a particular harmonic series fragment.  Given a 10:12:15 triad, the mechanism would recognize the fifth first, which leads to an expectation of a 4:5:6 as the simplest harmonic series configuration of three tones bounded by a fifth. This expectation is not satisfied.  Whether 10:12:15 is eventually recognized as a harmonic series segment or remains a collection of dyads is an open question.

It seems entirely plausible to me that a wider variety of intervals can come into play, particularly when register is considered.  e.g. tune up a pair of sine waves in 9:7s.  You will find that the quality is highly depended upon register.  With the lower tone above 660 Hz or so, thus entering in the typical range for 7th and 9th partials produced by male voices, it clearly becomes a consonance.  But it is entirely possible that, with such intervals, other mechanisms are at exclusively work, especially combination tones.  (The large sine-wave chords used by La Monte Young, for example, most plausibly depend on common difference tones.)</p></div><h3><a id=80211 href="#80211">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2009 10:58:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Jan 22, 2009 at 6:29 AM, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;Marcel de Velde&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;That the minor 3rd is heard as a clouded major third sounds false to me.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not the minor third, but the entire triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;And I&apos;m not quite sure what you mean by that 10:12:15 takes more time to<br/>&gt; resolve<br/>&gt; than 4:5:6.

That&apos;s kind of the same thing as a Gmaj<br/>triad over a Cmaj triad (with an E minor in there somewhere) and I<br/>somehow feel that I&apos;m perceiving it as having fundamentals a fifth<br/>apart or something. So in that context, a C minor would have a C<br/>fundamental from the C and G, and then an Eb fundamental from the Eb<br/>and the G. I think the two fundamentals interact and somehow give rise<br/>to the full &quot;character&quot; of the chord. I could be wrong - from<br/>rereading what I wrote, the idea has some holes in it, but I don&apos;t<br/>think the Eb in a C minor chord is just discarded as &quot;useless&quot; - I<br/>feel like the 5/4 between Eb and G is pretty strong and does something<br/>to it. For a neutral triad in a low register, I could hear how the<br/>third would completely jam up the works, but I feel like a minor triad<br/>it runs a bit more smoothly.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=80213 href="#80213">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2009 4:10:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, if it&apos;s true that a minor chord sounds the way it does because<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a &quot;bastardized&quot; major chord, then why don&apos;t sus4 chords sound<br/>&gt; dissonant?

You know that chord<br/>- it&apos;s the &quot;sun comes out and all of the birdies sing&quot; chord. Far from<br/>dissonant. That chord is often also used as a substitute for a V7 as<br/>well, often sounding less dissonant than V7 in that context.</p><p>As caleb stated, modern modal theory, which is still developing but<br/>uses nonetheless in a good amount of modern musical contexts,<br/>generally acknowledges sus chords as having more functions than just a<br/>delayed resolution to a major triad. The idea is that music can have<br/>more than just 2 types of tonality to operate on: in addition to major<br/>and minor, all of the modes in between and beyond can be used as<br/>stable tonal centers that have their own functional harmonies and<br/>expectations of how things will resolve. Rather than describing major<br/>as &quot;happy&quot; and minor as &quot;sad&quot;, or major as &quot;consonant&quot; and minor as<br/>&quot;dissonant&quot;, the modes are often treated in a spectrum ranging from<br/>&quot;brightest&quot; to &quot;darkest&quot;, or &quot;most major&quot; to &quot;most minor&quot;, or<br/>something like that. Lydian is the &quot;brightest&quot; diatonic mode, and<br/>Locrian is the &quot;darkest&quot; (in basic modal theory, anyway).</p><p>In mixolydian mode, for example, a common chord progression would be<br/>something like I / bVII IV / I. You can hear it as the bVII as a<br/>IV/IV, and so it&apos;s sort of like a double plagal cadence if you want to<br/>think of it that way. Functional harmonies like that exist in all 7 of<br/>the diatonic modes (even Locrian, which is a bit harder to work with),<br/>as well as all 7 of the modes of the melodic minor, harmonic minor,<br/>and harmonic major scales. Often chords are &quot;borrowed&quot; from other<br/>modes (just like borrowed chords work in the common practice system)<br/>to create a more heightened emotional response. A sus13 chord, such as<br/>Bbmaj7 over C, is often used to flesh out the Mixolydian mode in such<br/>a fashion, and doesn&apos;t sound dissonant to my ears, but rather<br/>&quot;colorful&quot;.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=80221 href="#80221">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2009 10:21:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Even more so, sus chords can sound extremely consonant and in most<br/>&gt; musical contexts outside of common practice harmony are treated that<br/>&gt; way.

About what you&apos;d expect for a 9-limit otonality in fact.  What paradox were you seeing in that original paragraph?</p><p>In what context is a second not considered a dissonance in common practice harmony?  The dissonance resolving down to the 3 is pretty much the definition of &quot;suspension&quot;.  But we know that the &quot;sus&quot; prefix is used outside of that context these days.  The sus4 chord is one of the archetypal dissonances, and probably the reason fourths in general (in the bass) got classed as dissonant.</p><p>But yes, getting to the point, a minor chord isn&apos;t treated as a dissonance.  It fails to be a major triad, and isn&apos;t an otonality, and so it wasn&apos;t used to end a piece in some styles.  You could call this a weak requirement of resolution.  But still, basically it&apos;s a consonance.  So if a minor triad counts as a consonance why shouldn&apos;t the slightly more dissonant sus4 also be a consonance by analogy?  Failing to be major obviously isn&apos;t enough to make something dissonant.</p><p>Here&apos;s a point that doesn&apos;t fit in anywhere so I&apos;ll mention it here: quartal harmony works well in (12 note) equal temperament.  The fourths are much better tuned than the thirds.  So for 20th Century music, with an equally tempered standard, it isn&apos;t so surprising to see the fourths asserting themselves.

Rather than describing major<br/>&gt; as &quot;happy&quot; and minor as &quot;sad&quot;, or major as &quot;consonant&quot; and minor as<br/>&gt; &quot;dissonant&quot;, the modes are often treated in a spectrum ranging from<br/>&gt; &quot;brightest&quot; to &quot;darkest&quot;, or &quot;most major&quot; to &quot;most minor&quot;, or<br/>&gt; something like that.

You can interpret this as saying jazz doesn&apos;t like otonalities.

You can hear it as the bVII as a<br/>&gt; IV/IV, and so it&apos;s sort of like a double plagal cadence if you want to<br/>&gt; think of it that way. Functional harmonies like that exist in all 7 of<br/>&gt; the diatonic modes (even Locrian, which is a bit harder to work with),<br/>&gt; as well as all 7 of the modes of the melodic minor, harmonic minor,<br/>&gt; and harmonic major scales. Often chords are &quot;borrowed&quot; from other<br/>&gt; modes (just like borrowed chords work in the common practice system)<br/>&gt; to create a more heightened emotional response. A sus13 chord, such as<br/>&gt; Bbmaj7 over C, is often used to flesh out the Mixolydian mode in such<br/>&gt; a fashion, and doesn&apos;t sound dissonant to my ears, but rather<br/>&gt; &quot;colorful&quot;.</p><p>Isn&apos;t &quot;colorful&quot; the new word for &quot;dissonant&quot;?</p><p>                        Graham</p></div><h3><a id=80245 href="#80245">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2009 8:18:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>for what it is worth I use and hear sus chords as inversions of quintal<br/>harmony.</p><p>I find that stacked 4ths and 5ths are &quot;mood neutral&quot; - they deny either<br/>major or minor.<br/>As an extension then - you have this beginning of a cluster of major 2nds -<br/>and quite frankly I find stacked major 2nds acceptable in some contexts as<br/>well.

They have a major second in them, which is probably more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; dissonant than a major third, and the expectation of the third isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fulfilled in that chord either.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; What theory are you working on where a sus4 isn&apos;t a dissonance?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t sound all that dissonant. In certain common-practice<br/>&gt; &gt; contexts, it is traditionally treated as a &apos;dissonance&apos; in which the 4<br/>&gt; &gt; resolves downward to the 3. However, even in those contexts, a minor<br/>&gt; &gt; chord isn&apos;t treated as a &apos;dissonance&apos; in which the minor 3 moves up to<br/>&gt; &gt; a major 3 or something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, not &quot;all that&quot; dissonant, but ... dissonant. About<br/>&gt; what you&apos;d expect for a 9-limit otonality in fact. What<br/>&gt; paradox were you seeing in that original paragraph?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In what context is a second not considered a dissonance in<br/>&gt; common practice harmony? The dissonance resolving down to<br/>&gt; the 3 is pretty much the definition of &quot;suspension&quot;. But we<br/>&gt; know that the &quot;sus&quot; prefix is used outside of that context<br/>&gt; these days. The sus4 chord is one of the archetypal<br/>&gt; dissonances, and probably the reason fourths in general (in<br/>&gt; the bass) got classed as dissonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But yes, getting to the point, a minor chord isn&apos;t treated<br/>&gt; as a dissonance. It fails to be a major triad, and isn&apos;t an<br/>&gt; otonality, and so it wasn&apos;t used to end a piece in some<br/>&gt; styles. You could call this a weak requirement of<br/>&gt; resolution. But still, basically it&apos;s a consonance. So if<br/>&gt; a minor triad counts as a consonance why shouldn&apos;t the<br/>&gt; slightly more dissonant sus4 also be a consonance by<br/>&gt; analogy? Failing to be major obviously isn&apos;t enough to make<br/>&gt; something dissonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a point that doesn&apos;t fit in anywhere so I&apos;ll mention<br/>&gt; it here: quartal harmony works well in (12 note) equal<br/>&gt; temperament. The fourths are much better tuned than the<br/>&gt; thirds. So for 20th Century music, with an equally tempered<br/>&gt; standard, it isn&apos;t so surprising to see the fourths<br/>&gt; asserting themselves. Do you have a near-JI context to<br/>&gt; compare 10:12:15 with 6:8:9?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Even more so, sus chords can sound extremely consonant and in most<br/>&gt; &gt; musical contexts outside of common practice harmony are treated that<br/>&gt; &gt; way.
