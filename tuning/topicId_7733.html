My impression is<br/>&gt; that in an 8/7 second the upper pitch seems to be the &quot;root&quot; and in the 9/8<br/>&gt; second the lower pitch seems to be the root.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In regard to singing a major second over a pedal, it would seem a given that<br/>&gt; the ear would like to hear 9/8--the drone being heard as &quot;root.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>This was the answer I expected. There is an ongoing sort of &quot;philosophical<br/>debate&quot; regarding characters of intervals in a tuning system. [This should<br/>be understood to be referring to fixed-pitch instruments/ensembles].</p><p>An &quot;odd limit&quot; system is one that expresses rational ratios up to a<br/>certain &quot;odd limit&quot; in either the numerator or denominator. A differrent<br/>viewpoint, held by some, is that prime numbers are the ones that add<br/>&quot;new information&quot;, and thus would think more in lines of a &quot;prime limit&quot;<br/>system.</p><p>To someone who believed that &apos;locking in&apos; would have something to do with<br/>the lowest &quot;odd limit&quot;, then 8/7 should have more &apos;gravity&apos; than 9/8. For<br/>someone believing in &apos;prime limit&apos;, then 9/8 would have more gravity than<br/>10/9 (highest prime factor of 3 vs 5) and both more than 8/7 (prime limit<br/>of 7).</p><p>However, for dyads, this small selection seem to be pointing to fitting<br/>with the overtone series, where 9/8 expresses the lower note as the root.</p><p>Is feeling of locking stronger on 8/7 than 10/9? In 8/7, part of the<br/>dyad will be an &apos;octave&apos; of the difference tone, whereas neither the<br/>10/9 has that strong of a relation...</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...the most natural &apos;tritone&apos; (for want of a less<br/>&gt; &gt; weighted term), is it 7/5, 11/8, 10/7 or something<br/>&gt; &gt; else?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The term &quot;natural&quot; may be a bit ambiguous here (see, Paul, I am listening),<br/>&gt; but it is quite easy to hear the difference between the 7/5 diminished fifth<br/>&gt; and the 10/7 augmented fourth. Today in my musicianship class I was tuning<br/>&gt; (locking) these randomly and asking my third semester students to identify<br/>&gt; them. They could readily do so by sensing whether the top pitch wanted to<br/>&gt; resolve upward (leading tone to tonic) or downward (chord seventh to third).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 11/8 &quot;tritone&quot; is not related to the other two, I feel. Its most</p><p>This is really interesting to me. I had a good instructor in my &apos;listenning<br/>analysis&apos; class at Berklee (Tom Plsek(sp), who also did a lot of &apos;modern<br/>classical&apos; trombone performances). One excercise was him playing a C on the<br/>piano and having us sing an F#. We were all guitar &apos;flat&apos; relative to the<br/>piano, though our F# was much more pleasing.</p><p>I also wrote a song with the same trick. The song was in C major, triadic,<br/>and the bridge ended on an F# major chord with a C in the melody which was<br/>to be held over into the verse, which started again with a C major.<br/>There was a compromise I had to reach in singing the C, wanting to flatten<br/>it to sound good on the F#, but not wanting to have audible retuning when<br/>the C chord sounded.</p><p>In both cases, I THOUGHT I was &apos;locking&apos; on the 11/8 (not the term I used<br/>but thats the feeling). Now I realize that I was probably NOT that far<br/>South! I&apos;ll have to go back and see just what that tritone I was singing...</p><p>Others mentioned the 45/32, and I think that is probably a strong<br/>candidate.</p><p>Ooops, snipped your comments about 11/8. I do believe that this is used<br/>melodically. Before you joined the list we had some discussions with John<br/>Link regarding altered dominant chords or thier logical inverse,<br/>the &quot;lydian dominant&quot; sound 7 9 #11 13. In my experiments I was not<br/>convinced that this was properly tuned in the &quot;lower overtone&quot;<br/>manner, (7:9:11:13) but felt that the &quot;upper structure triad&quot; needed to<br/>be expressed, which would make it more</p><p>             7/4 9/8 45/32 27/16.</p><p>I was somewhat convinced in these discussions that some of the big<br/>jazz chords I like are really coming more from the tempered world than<br/>some other.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The idea here is that people who believe in greater<br/>&gt; &gt; importance for &quot;prime limits&quot;, &quot;odd limits&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;overtone series significance&quot; would probably see some<br/>&gt; &gt; different sorting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You left me here, Bob. I&apos;d love to know what these phrases mean in layman&apos;s<br/>&gt; English, particularly the first two. Also, how are you using the word<br/>&gt; &quot;sorting.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I hope I made it a little more clear what I was looking for. I&apos;m wondering<br/>how deep the pockets are and sorting the intervals according to the depth<br/>of the pocket they fall into when they lock. I&apos;m trying to take that idea<br/>and relate it (somehow) to some of the other discussions we&apos;ve had regarding<br/>tuning systems. Probably in a very confused manner, luckilly, I&apos;ll be<br/>straightened out in no time.</p><p>thanks for answerring.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p><p>&gt; Jerry<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Probably in a very confused manner, luckilly, I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt;straightened out in no time.</p><p>I think the &quot;depth of the pockets&quot; is related to three factors: virtual<br/>fundamental finding (which is a combination of both rootedness and harmonic<br/>entropy); beating/roughness minimization (see Sethares); and combination<br/>tones. These factors interact with one another and are highly dependent on<br/>timbre and amplitude and I don&apos;t think a full mathematical model is in our<br/>grasp at the moment. Best to look at the pieces individually for now.</p></div>
