In the light of a sunny day, Monz, I do know that you are one of the<br/>&quot;good guys&quot; and would not post anything intentionally to offend. Let&apos;s<br/>consider it _my problem and forget it, please.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul and I had both already explained that your understanding<br/>&gt; of the use of the term &apos;tritone&apos; was not the full story,<br/>&gt; and yet you continued to express that particular definition<br/>&gt; of &apos;tritone&apos; as the only one.  You know we can&apos;t let you<br/>&gt; get away with that  :) ....</p><p>I probably should know that by now, but you know what they say about &quot;old<br/>dogs.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>Monz, later:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I noted in the original reply that you seem to have missed,<br/>&gt; there are several definitions for &apos;tritone&apos; (and many other<br/>&gt; terms) that are all acceptable.  Certain definitions may be<br/>&gt; current only at certain times or places or only with certain<br/>&gt; authors, or many of them may have varying degrees of currency<br/>&gt; all at the same time.  I was simply trying to clear up what<br/>&gt; looked to me like mis-information being passed along; or at<br/>&gt; any rate, as I said above, you were limiting yourself to one<br/>&gt; particular definition but passing it along as the *only* one.<br/>&gt;<br/>For well over half a century, I have understood the term &quot;tritone&quot; to refer<br/>to the unique symmetrically-invertible interval of the modern keyboard.<br/>That&apos;s how I use the term. If it has previously been used in other ways<br/>centuries ago (and now by folks who know about such things), it does not<br/>immediately affect my habitual use of the term (to my own detriment, in this<br/>case, in that it detracted from the point I was attempting to make).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In response to the rest of your post, all I can say is that<br/>&gt; (as I repeat yet again) &apos;context is everything&apos;,<br/>&gt; and in today&apos;s<br/>&gt; multi-cultural global communication network, I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; anyone should try to explain anything without making the<br/>&gt; context clear.</p><p>Now that I know another meaning for the word in _this community, I will be<br/>sure to be specific (as you do here when referring 12-tET, for example,<br/>instead of just &quot;tempered tuning.&quot; It is clear to me now what Paul&apos;s use was<br/>in _his context and my abrupt &quot;No&quot; was in _my context. Clearly we were both<br/>&quot;right&quot;; however,  communication suffered because of our different contexts.<br/>In that regard, do any of you mind terribly if I continue to use the word in<br/>&quot;my&quot; context in the future. Perhaps I&apos;ll add a footnote about yours. :-)</p><p>&gt; At least now, we&apos;ve accomplished that for<br/>&gt; your posts, and we can all understand more clearly what<br/>&gt; you&apos;re saying.</p><p>Groovy! (Whoops! I guess I just showed my generation.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose the whole &apos;conflict&apos; would have been avoided if<br/>&gt; I had already provided a good entry for &apos;tritone&apos; in my<br/>&gt; Dictionary, with *all* of its many meanings.<br/>&gt; (and no, it&apos;s still not in there... too busy right now...)</p><p>No need for you to carry any of the burden for this miscommunication.<br/>However, since the current general meaning of &quot;tritone&quot; is pretty much the<br/>way I used it, you might try to find the time _soon. LOL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for taking the trouble to dig out my post and to respond.</p><p>Thanks for understanding and excusing my uptight state of mind at the time.<br/>Also, and very importantly, all of us might note that because of this little<br/>&quot;conflict&quot; a good deal of positive &quot;light&quot; was provided in both directions.<br/>God bless the Tuning List! :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
