I have read<br/>that there are many 12 pitch Zalzal scales with quarter tones - there<br/>are a couple of them in Scala, and one in a basic JI book I&apos;ve got,<br/>but I would be very interested to study the construction of all of<br/>the known scales. Searching the internet has not turned up much of<br/>use to me (although I did find a list of Maqam that seems to have<br/>came from Paul Erlich - which I have converted to cents values - from<br/>53 Tet). If any of the other listers may know how I can obtain this<br/>information (if it is in fact all known), then I would be eternally<br/>grateful. I&apos;m seeking this information because I&apos;m now working on a<br/>CD with a musician who plays a number of Arabic drums, and I would<br/>like to use some appropriate scales for our collaboration.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Jacky</p></div><h3><a id=11453 href="#11453">ðŸ”—</a>George Kahrimanis &#x3C;anakreon@hol.gr&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2000 1:54:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;     we were recently talking to an oud player about the intonation<br/>&gt;throughout the mid east and in particular, the interval of<br/>&gt; Zalzal. He commented how the intonation varied from region to region,<br/>&gt;stating for instance that the intonation in Egypt was<br/>&gt; drastically different from that found in Iran. It was by the<br/>&gt;intonation differences in fact enabled him to tell him where the<br/>&gt; player was from.</p><p>Hello. Thank you for the interesting report. I am puzzled, though,<br/>because the neutral third does not seem to have a wide range.<br/>A little smaller and it will be like a 6/5 minor third; a little wider<br/>and it sounds like a 5/4 major third. Might it be something else<br/>in the playing, like in the articulation of the tones, that<br/>provided clues to that oud player? What do y&apos; all think?</p><p>- George Kahrimanis    <a href="mailto:anakreon@hol.gr">anakreon@hol.gr</a></p></div>
