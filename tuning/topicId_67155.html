After reading Mr. Sethares&apos; book TTSS and<br/>playing around with Scala and softsynths for a while I&apos;ve bought a<br/>DX7II FD to go all the way with FM, inharmonic ratio&apos;s and related<br/>tunings. I also want to explore the 5-tet and 7-tet, spectral<br/>tunings, and combinations of fm, additive synthesis and analog<br/>filtering.</p><p>But I have not yet managed to import scales from Scala into the user<br/>definable tuning memory (or on the cartridge or the floppy) of the<br/>DX7II.</p><p>Is this at all possible? When I checked the archive of this list I<br/>read about someone playing the xxx.mid file via Cakewalk, but I would<br/>like to get the tunings into the memory of the DX7II itself.</p><p>Is this done by sending the xxx.mid file to the DX7II as sysex data?</p><p>If yes: in the Scala user options (midi tab) I&apos;ve set the synth model<br/>to model 2: Yamaha DX7II/TX802, but I think I need to edit the<br/>send.cmd file. The MIDI player-field says &quot;no player found&quot; (I<br/>checked for the megamid.exe file: it&apos;s there) but the Scala help says<br/>that the file should be adapted. Unfortunately I don&apos;t know how to do<br/>this. Could anybody tell me what the send.cmd file should look like?</p><p>Furthermore I&apos;m not sure about how to set up the DX7II because I&apos;ve<br/>just bought it, and in the manual there&apos;s only information about<br/>exporting micro-tunings, not about importing them, so I might be<br/>missing something on that side as well.. Like how to send a tuning to<br/>the first user definable memory or to send it to the second one.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated a lot.</p><p>Greetings,</p><p>Anton</p></div><h3>Daniel &#x3C;danielioniusguitars@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2011 2:03:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You can possibly edit out the relevant tuning dump information from the xxx.mid file in a hex editor and just create an new hex file (I use WinHex) and then just save it with the .syx extension.</p><p>The TX-802 can store the microtuning table in the synth with the appropriate .syx file (sysex).</p><p>Alternatively, join this group and download a template tuning bank sysex here: <a href="http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/YamahaDX/message/12174">http://launch.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/YamahaDX/message/12174</a></p><p>The TX802 does note tune in equal steps of cents. It tunes progressively in intervals of 1.171875 cents, for the whole midi range. Each note on the keyboard can be changed. Please keep this in mind when creating scales.</p><p>Daniel.</p></div>
