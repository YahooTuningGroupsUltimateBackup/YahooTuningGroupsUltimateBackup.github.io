Sorry this took me so long.</p><p>That&apos;s all right,</p><p>&gt; &gt;It turned out to be 7 limit. (I expect that will please you :-)).</p><p>&gt; Interesting!  I&apos;ll try attacking it both in 5-lim and 7-lim, &amp; see<br/>&gt; what happens.</p><p>I&apos;ll be interested to hear.</p><p>Yes, I intended to do a 5-lim one, but on setting to, got interested in<br/>idea of doing it 7-lim. Could be interesting to see what happens to it<br/>in 5-lim. I might also try it again, as a 5-lim one also short like this.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Has an Ab and a G#, but both turn out to be 49/32!</p><p>&gt; Now I&apos;m confused!  There&apos;s only one Ab/G# in the piece, at 18.002<br/>&gt; seconds, and it&apos;s tuned +27.88 cents relative to 12-tET.  Lessee: 49/32<br/>&gt; would be 737.65 cents from root.  I&apos;ll bet you&apos;re using a G note for<br/>&gt; this, are you not?  That&apos;s a serious problem for my program, because I<br/>&gt; begin by stripping out your bends, then evaluate the scale degrees.<br/>&gt; (I don&apos;t yet have code to recognize input bends as _tuning_.  But in<br/>&gt; any case, for purposes of this &quot;puzzle&quot;, that would be cheating, yes?)</p><p>Should say before going any further, I did this all by ear,<br/>and some looking at the ratios that I play, and the analysis is<br/>after the event.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a G, - I choose midi notes to minimise the pitch bend, so<br/>that if a note needs to be bent while playing, one&apos;s got maximum range free<br/>for the pitch glissando.</p><p>The score showed the G# as an Ab in Ab minor but I think it is really a G# in<br/>G# minor, and I&apos;ve corrected the scorre.</p><p>At end of bar 6, the 49/64  ~64/21~  7/3 sounded nice for the fifth,<br/>even though it is a wolf fifth at 32/21 = 729.2 cents; and I liked it.<br/>Wouldn&apos;t work as a final chord of course.</p><p>Could easily be made pure by putting in a root control at G# at that point,<br/>which leaves the C# at the same pitch as for the C# root.</p><p>The Ab you found is in fact the A natural in the scale of E major at the<br/>start of bar 7, which is shifted down in pitch so much at this point that<br/>it is a lot closer to an Ab.</p><p>Root at this point is the C# which is 28/27</p><p>The sequence of chords in bars 7 to 8 is rather complex with some impure intervals,<br/>and will be interesting to see what happens to it when adaptively tuned.</p><p>For example, has an 11/9 A major resolving to an A minor (as shown<br/>on the score) which is really an A major at that point with a<br/>third of 243/196 = 372.1 cents.</p><p>I&apos;ve added a text file with an analysis of the progression to the html page,<br/>with all the j.i. intervals and the note names, and comments.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Uses David Canright&apos;s 7-limit j.i. scale.</p><p>&gt; Which I&apos;m sure I ought to be familiar with, but I&apos;m not.  However, I<br/>&gt; can guess that Bb is 7/4, if Ab is 49/32.  Wow, then I&apos;d expect D to<br/>&gt; be 35/32, and F to be 21/16; can _that_ be right???</p><p>The scale is:</p><p>1/1 28/27 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 14/9 5/3 7/4 15/8 2/1</p><p>You can read about it here:<br/><a href="http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/piano/index.htm">http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/piano/index.htm</a></p><p>&quot;This offers the chance to contrast, for example, a standard minor scale<br/>(on 5/4) with a septimal minor on 1/1: 1:1 9:8 7:6 4:3 3:2 14:9 7:4.&quot;</p><p>The septimal minor also gives a nice septimal pentatonic scale, which I use in this piece<br/>C Eb F Ab Bb C<br/>=<br/>1/1 7/6 4/3 14/9 7/4 2/1</p><p>steps<br/>7/6 8/7 7/6 9/8 8/7</p><p>SCALA info:</p><p>Interval class, Number of incidences, Size:<br/>  1:  1  9/8               203.910 cents  major whole tone<br/>  1:  2  8/7               231.174 cents  septimal whole tone<br/>  1:  2  7/6               266.871 cents  septimal minor third<br/>  2:  1  9/7               435.084 cents  septimal major third, BP third<br/>  2:  1  21/16             470.781 cents  narrow fourth<br/>  2:  3  4/3               498.045 cents  perfect fourth<br/>  3:  3  3/2               701.955 cents  perfect fifth<br/>  3:  1  32/21             729.219 cents  wide fifth<br/>  3:  1  14/9              764.916 cents  septimal minor sixth<br/>  4:  2  12/7              933.129 cents  septimal major sixth<br/>  4:  2  7/4               968.826 cents  harmonic seventh<br/>  4:  1  16/9              996.090 cents  Pythagorean minor seventh</p><p>At the end of bar 11, all the notes of this pentatonic are sounding.</p><p>I use it with Bb as the root instead of C. I.e. successive semitones<br/>from Bb upwards are identical to those of the original scale<br/>from C upwards.</p><p>I&apos;m using cross set root control, which keeps the note chosen for the root<br/>fixed, so Bb is 7/4 at this point, as in the original scale.</p><p>The C becomes a 9/8 above 7/4, (the 9/8 of the septimal minor scale)<br/>at 63/64.</p><p>The Ab then becomes an 8/7 below the Bb, so is at 49/32.</p><p>At this point the D is indeed the 35/32, and the F the 21/16,<br/>(or would be if they were played) because of the root control<br/>change to Bb at 7/4.</p><p>The key it is playing in at that point is Db, and the 63/64 C is<br/>the leading tone, and I&apos;m using the septimal pentatonic as the minor<br/>pentatonic in Db.</p><p>However, this is all with the C at 63/64.

Could you<br/>&gt; possibly redo it using scale degree 8 for Ab/G#?
