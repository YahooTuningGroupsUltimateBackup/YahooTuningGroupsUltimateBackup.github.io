I really like it.</p><p>&gt; The only other thing I can think of is to do it so that you<br/>&gt; open the documents in new windows from a window consisting<br/>&gt; of just the tree.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, that will &quot;force&quot; people to do it the new way, and, perhaps,<br/>there WILL be some people who want the tree to remain on the page...</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t mind it, either, but the text and information to the right<br/>does not always &quot;fit&quot; so it involves &quot;scrolling,&quot; making it difficult<br/>to read...  Also for, &quot;in depth&quot; study, it seems much better to see a<br/>full uninterrupted page, I think...</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s not so elegant, but does do the job - see latest version of<br/>&gt; the tree.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/tree/tree.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert</p><p>It&apos;s looking good.</p><p>I believe the only FAQ that has already been written that has NOT<br/>been included is Daniel Wolf&apos;s fine FAQ on meantone.</p><p>Daniel, is that FAQ ready for posting??  If so, Robert Walker or I<br/>can add it to the FAQ tree...??</p><p>I don&apos;t have the archive number right here, but if Daniel feels the<br/>FAQ is ready for posting a quick search, I am sure, will find it...</p><p>Were there any other &quot;completed&quot; ones that people recall??</p><p>And ROBERT, for now couldn&apos;t we just keep the tree on YOUR site??  I<br/>have no idea how large it&apos;s going to be, but right now it consists of<br/>mostly text.  It can&apos;t even be 1 meg yet.  Can&apos;t we keep it there<br/>until it gets to large for you to host it??</p><p>Just wondering...</p><p>Even already, it&apos;s a great tool to refer new people to.  We can just<br/>give them the link as their first &quot;welcome&quot; post!  Well, maybe it<br/>needs just a bit more &quot;filling in&quot; before it&apos;s ready for that...</p><p>Best</p><p>_______ ______ _____ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
