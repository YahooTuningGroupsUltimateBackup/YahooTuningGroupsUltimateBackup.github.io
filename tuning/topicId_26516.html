Then you pick up<br/>&gt; a guitar and play a C13 chord, and compare it to 4-5-6-7-9-11-13 and<br/>&gt; say, &quot;well geee, thats not really it at all&quot;. I was dissappointed to<br/>&gt; see the book &apos;Lies my music teacher taught me&apos; making these sorts of<br/>&gt; claims.</p><p>This points out the wonderful variety of perspectives in the different<br/>kinds of analyses of tuning and other aspects of music.  Everyone<br/>hears differently, and so while there may be large areas of agreement<br/>among many people about the validity of certain theoretical ideas<br/>about tuning and music, ultimately everyone&apos;s perspective on this<br/>is uniquely his/her own.</p><p>Please indulge me, and allow me to recount a pleasant experience<br/>I had today ...</p><p>I had a rather light schedule today, and while I tuned a small<br/>Wurlitzer upright piano this morning in 12-EDO, and searched<br/>(by ear) for just the right amount of stretch, to even out the<br/>overtone-beating on the low strings, I spent a little while<br/>meditating on the sound of the harmonics of the &quot;C&quot; 2 8ves<br/>below middle-C.</p><p>This piano is in pretty good condition (altho I hadn&apos;t been<br/>tuned in many years), and as the sound of that string lingered<br/>on and on, it changed slightly, the lower harmonics softening<br/>as the higher harmonics gradually came into better focus.</p><p>[refer to mclaren&apos;s crazy_music post of a couple of days ago<br/>&lt; note the sloppy scholarship  :)  &gt;<br/>comparing perception of harmonic ideas while composing,<br/>to looking thru a telescope]</p><p>I could clearly hear a beautiful chord... reminiscent of<br/>some of La Monte Young&apos;s mellower pieces.  I&apos;d describe<br/>the chord like this:</p><p>~harmonic  72edo   8ve + cents</p><p>   14       Bb&lt;     3    967&amp;2/3<br/>   11       F^      3    550<br/>    7       Bb&lt;     2    967&amp;2/3<br/>    5       E-      2    383&amp;1/3<br/>    3       G       1    700<br/>    1       C       0      0</p><p>[Here&apos;s the Monzo 72-EDO notation legend:</p><p>symbol  72edo  cents</p><p>  ^      +3   50              A<br/>  &gt;      +2   33&amp;1/3          |<br/>  +      +1   16&amp;2/3   plus cents from 12-EDO<br/>          0    0<br/>  -      -1   16&amp;2/3   minus cents from 12-EDO<br/>  &lt;      -2   33&amp;1/3          |<br/>  v      -3   50              V                ]</p><p>Note that I&apos;m thinking (in my mind) in terms<br/>of two different theories, and also with a<br/>variation of the latter one:</p><p>1)<br/>the theory of prime-affect, in which the<br/>chord-identites each display a &quot;ness&quot; (in this<br/>case, &quot;2-ness, 3-ness, 5-ness, 7-ness, 11-ness&quot;),<br/>which is primarily a harmonic sensibility.</p><p>This is represented by the low-integer proportion.</p><p>2)<br/>the equally-divided-pitch-continuum theory, (which<br/>in this case is 72-EDO [= 12 x 6 equal divisions of<br/>the 8ve], or in another description, 72-ED2 [= 12 x 6<br/>equal divisions of the proportion &quot;2&quot;]), which is<br/>primarily a melodic sensibility.</p><p>This is represented by the 72-EDO adaptation of<br/>regular meantone-based 12-EDO notation, which<br/>in turn represents specific cents values [12 x 100 =<br/>1200-EDO, which is a finer division in the same genre<br/>of tuning].</p><p>All these ideas were turning around in my mind,<br/>as I listened to the 1-string chord resonate,<br/>and I tried to formulate a systematic way of<br/>comprehending in my mind what I was hearing.</p><p>It got me to thinking about Schoenberg&apos;s compostions<br/>and theories, for reasons which will unfold as I<br/>go along...</p><p>A big part of the reason why I value Schoenberg&apos;s theories<br/>so much, regardless of scientific experiments which invalidate<br/>them, is because his many of his descriptions resonate so<br/>strongly with my own perceptions.</p><p>I&apos;m speculating, but I really strongly suspect that<br/>Schoenberg got many of his harmonic ideas c. 1907-10<br/>from listening to low piano strings as I was doing<br/>today.  His _Harmonielehre_ makes references to the<br/>kinds of ideas I presented above, and...</p><p>On the Wurlitzer, the &quot;C&quot; another 8ve below that one<br/>bloomed an even richer sonic palette, which reminded<br/>me of Schoenberg&apos;s description (in _Harmonielehre_)<br/>of a sustained chord he used in _Erwartung_ which<br/>contains many &quot;dissonant&quot; notes, and, in part, compares<br/>it to the type of &quot;natural&quot; sound like the one I heard.</p><p>(Schoenberg also gives another type of analysis which<br/>resembles the theory of &quot;non-harmonic tones&quot; and their<br/>resolution.  Martin Vogel has done a JI-based analysis of<br/>this chord, which appeared in abbreviated form in English<br/>in _On the Relations of Tone_, and more fully in German<br/>in _Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;nberg und die Folgen_, and I have done a more<br/>detailed and extensive one in my book _JustMusic_.)</p><p>Anyway, on this lower &quot;C&quot; I could eventually (actually<br/>after quite a long time) hear the 13th harmonic very<br/>clearly, while the 11th died away much faster.</p><p>Indeed, as I listened to this lower note I could not<br/>escape the memory of all manner of harmonic snippets<br/>from Schoenberg&apos;s compositions of this period, and<br/>especially that big chord from _Erwartung_, which<br/>Schoenberg notes is to be played softly, which really<br/>causes it to resemble the kinds of sounds with which<br/>the Wurlitzer massaged my ears this morning.</p><p>So in many ways I was thinking of a very wide variety<br/>of perspectives on tuning theory as I meditated on those<br/>gorgeous 1-note chords.  Brian has described Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>music as &quot;brutal&quot; and other such ugly epithets, and he&apos;s<br/>certainly not alone in that.  But Schoenberg&apos;s compositions<br/>do have sensously beautiful moments like this one in<br/>_Erwartung_ that are probably the ultimate in abstract<br/>music-making: simply playing around with sounds.</p><p>I view Schoenberg&apos;s theoretical work as a necessarily vague<br/>exploration of the approximations 12-EDO may make to a vast<br/>multitude of different systematic ways of comprehending<br/>a partitioning of the pitch-continuum.  I say necessarily,<br/>because Schoenberg realized that the breadth of these ideas<br/>exceeded not only his own limited mathematical understanding,<br/>but ultimately that of anyone&apos;s.</p><p>Which leads me back to my opening statement... and which<br/>hopefully will help to explain some of my admiration for<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s work.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=26519 href="#26519">ðŸ”—</a>J Gill &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2001 8:40:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Note that I&apos;m thinking (in my mind) in terms<br/>&gt; of two different theories, and also with a<br/>&gt; variation of the latter one:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1)<br/>&gt; the theory of prime-affect, in which the<br/>&gt; chord-identites each display a &quot;ness&quot; (in this<br/>&gt; case, &quot;2-ness, 3-ness, 5-ness, 7-ness, 11-ness&quot;),<br/>&gt; which is primarily a harmonic sensibility.<br/>&gt; This is represented by the low-integer proportion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2)<br/>&gt; the equally-divided-pitch-continuum theory, (which<br/>&gt; in this case is 72-EDO [= 12 x 6 equal divisions of<br/>&gt; the 8ve], or in another description, 72-ED2 [= 12 x 6<br/>&gt; equal divisions of the proportion &quot;2&quot;]), which is<br/>&gt; primarily a melodic sensibility.<br/>&gt; This is represented by the 72-EDO adaptation of<br/>&gt; regular meantone-based 12-EDO notation, which<br/>&gt; in turn represents specific cents values [12 x 100 =<br/>&gt; 1200-EDO, which is a finer division in the same genre<br/>&gt; of tuning].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All these ideas were turning around in my mind,<br/>&gt; as I listened to the 1-string chord resonate,<br/>&gt; and I tried to formulate a systematic way of<br/>&gt; comprehending in my mind what I was hearing.</p><p>Monz,</p><p>Without attempting to take your thoughts quoted here<br/>(which only represent a excerpt from your interesting post),<br/>I had a thought about your dichotomy of &quot;harmonic/melodic&quot;<br/>sensibility, as you put it.</p><p>While the dichotomy itself is (I think) a worthwhile one,<br/>perhaps Nature slyly inverts these two aspects. Consider<br/>a keyboard (for computational convenience) with a bass-note<br/>fundamental pitch of 1 Hz (cycle per second), 72 keys per<br/>octave, and plenty of keys to span higher octaves, as well:</p><p>(1) Here I see that the trend of greater and greater sub-<br/>    divisions of the octave ultimately tends toward a limit<br/>    where, for instance, on the keyboard described above,<br/>    there exists an individual key for *each and every*<br/>    possible harmonic, or &quot;partial&quot;, of the 1 Hz bass-note.<br/>    Thus, the sound spectrum approaches one that could *also*<br/>    be characterized as exclusively &quot;harmonic&quot;, where,<br/>    relative to the 1 Hz &quot;tonic&quot;, ALL of its natural harmonics are<br/>    represented, and ALL of the harmonics of any of the keys<br/>    also represent integer multiples of that 1 Hz fundamental.</p><p>(2) In my &quot;harmonic dual&quot; theory, where, in the case of the<br/>     Ellis&apos; 12-tone &quot;Duodene&quot; JI scale, the overlapping of the<br/>     harmonics of simultaneously sounded dyadic tone pairs<br/>     of the low numbered 5-limit prime interval ratios which<br/>     are contained within the &quot;Duodene&quot; result in patterns<br/>     of &quot;movement&quot; (counted by the movement in *keys*)<br/>     which result in distinct and symmetrical locations on<br/>     the keyboard where the *harmonics* which are<br/>     generated by any two tones within the (in this case,<br/>     12-tone scale) will overlap, and in that manner<br/>     likely (in some way) affect the sense of &quot;cordance&quot;.<br/>     Here, the specific values of the exponents of the prime<br/>     factors of the scale intervals, in a systematic form<br/>     (as you and I have discussed in our recent private<br/>     communications) clearly influence the form of the<br/>     pattern of *keys* between which &quot;consonant&quot; dyads<br/>     may be formed on the (12-tone, in this case) keyboard,<br/>     which, in turn, reflects a characteristic of interacting<br/>     *harmonics* (between the various 12 interval ratios of<br/>     Ellis&apos; &quot;Harmonic Duodene&quot; scale, and, perhaps also,<br/>     for certain other similarly structured N-tone scales).<br/>     Here, then is a case where the &quot;2-ness, 3-ness,<br/>     5-ness, and perhaps, also, the 7-ness, 11-ness, etc.<br/>     clearly comes into play, not necessarily in the sense<br/>     of separable &quot;prime-voices&quot;, but, instead in the sense<br/>     of demonstrable &quot;intertwining&quot; (for lack of a better term)<br/>     in the course of the occurance of often perceived<br/>     &quot;harmony&quot; between the two tones of a dyad, these<br/>     patterns (or &quot;structures&quot;) of movement in *keys* to<br/>     realize &quot;harmonious&quot; combinations existing in what<br/>     are symmetrical patterns around the &quot;harmonic duals&quot;<br/>     (1/1 and 3/2, 9/8 and 4/3, 6/5 and 5/4, 8/5 and 15/8,<br/>     16/15 and 45/32).</p><p>To summarize my thoughts here, perhaps a continuum<br/>exists between a &quot;small numbered&quot; scale (such as the<br/>12-note &quot;Harmonic Duodene&quot;), where the primes, which<br/>predominately exist in what are &quot;low-numbered&quot; interval<br/>ratios, govern - at what particular *keys* - the *harmonics*<br/>will (in coinciding, or overlapping) interact to generate a<br/>&quot;consonance&quot; (due to low numbered &quot;inter-tone&quot; ratios),<br/>while a &quot;large numbered&quot; scale (such as 72-note EDO)<br/>is, itself, virtually a keyboard of individually selectable<br/>*harmonics* (of the 1 Hz bass-tone fundamental, and<br/>to an increasing extent as the number of scale intervals<br/>per octave is increased, of the various integer multiples<br/>of the 1 Hz fundamental, as well), which are selected by<br/>striking various *keys* located on the keyboard.</p><p>Once again, in scales with a small number of interval<br/>ratios (such as the 12-tone Duodene), the *harmonic*<br/>structure dictates which *keys* may be successfully<br/>played simultaneously (without suffering ear-pains)<br/>in specific patterns above/below the *keys* which<br/>represent the &quot;harmonic duals&quot; described above,</p><p>while in scales with a large number of intervals within<br/>the octave (such as 72-note EDO), the *key* structure<br/>dictates which *harmonics* may be played simultan-<br/>eously in specific patterns above/below whatever may<br/>be the chosen *key* representing a reference &quot;tonic&quot;.</p><p>Thus, duality upon duality exists in this world within a world...</p><p>Respectfully,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=26525 href="#26525">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/29/2001 2:57:22 PM</span><button style="float: right;
