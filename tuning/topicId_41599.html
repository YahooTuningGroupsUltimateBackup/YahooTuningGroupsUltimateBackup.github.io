I have even recorded some of my own<br/>&gt;music (12-ET pop) in response to its inspiration. It saddens me that you<br/>&gt;feel it necessary to employ such derisive tactics in discussion and debate.</p><p>Anaphoria is Kraig Grady&apos;s site. We have the same initials, but are different people. I didn&apos;t call anyone specific an asshole, I merely made a general statement. But I wouldn&apos;t want Kraig Grady blamed for my personality flaws.</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div>
