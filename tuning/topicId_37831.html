By<br/>extension, a recording without just but only 72 division intervals does not<br/>bend..how could a trombonist go against the recording?</p><p>&gt; Although, other people at the concert seemed to be hearing Just...at<br/>&gt; least *sometimes!*<br/>&gt;</p><p>What does this mean, hearing just?  As someone that sings just intonation all<br/>the time, this makes little sense.  I guess I&apos;ll ask each individual person<br/>what they mean by hearing &quot;just sometimes.&quot;</p><p>&gt; I guess the only way we&apos;ll find out is for me to write lots of pieces<br/>&gt; in 72-tET and try to arrange lots of performances!!!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Maybe it is a good idea to write a true experimental piece, meaning a piece<br/>where an experiment is tried and the result is actually in question.

Tristan approximates his<br/>just intervals to quartertones, yes.  Does that mean he is getting the best<br/>resolutions of his ideas?  I don&apos;t think so.  He has given up on players.<br/>Too bad considering I have all the players than could do his music justice.</p><p>As for John Eaton, did you hear his opera &quot;Danton and Robespierre&quot; which is<br/>polymicrotonal (Danton is just and Robespierre is in eighthtones).  Actually,<br/>John has used just on and off.  But never anything for bassoon.  He said<br/>bassoonists always complained and c(w)ouldn&apos;t play his microtones.  When I<br/>say John&apos;s opera &quot;Cry of Clytemnestra&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in<br/>the &apos;80s, a prominent bassoonist would spin his bocal up and down to &quot;effect&quot;<br/>quartertones.  Real low tech.  I heard his Mass which we are planning to<br/>produce next years with quartertones and sixthtones.  Beautiful.  But not<br/>everyone liked just, like Xenakis.  But John Eaton does.</p><p>&gt; Surely, 72-tET is going to do a better job of Just emulation than<br/>&gt; *quartertones!*  So it seems...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Not for the 11th limit it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph</p><p>best, Johnny</p></div><h3><a id=37854 href="#37854">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2002 7:37:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_37831.html#37853">/tuning/topicId_37831.html#37853</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; Surely, 72-tET is going to do a better job of Just emulation than<br/>&gt; &gt; *quartertones!*  So it seems...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not for the 11th limit it doesn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Johnny!</p><p>Well, the bottom line is that I&apos;m not going to quibble about a 2 or 3<br/>cent discrepancy.

I would<br/>like to run into a collection of such musicians in one place<br/>sometime. The number of commercially available recordings of<br/>musicians (other than fixed tuned instrumentalists) who play or sing<br/>with this kind of precision is vanishingly small in my experience. I<br/>have a few such recordings, but they are exceptional and I wish I had<br/>more.</p><p>On the other hand, or rather, for the same reason, the statement<br/>that &quot;no conductor would allow&quot; a just third at the end of a symphony<br/>movement I find to be a bit hard to swallow. I have heard string<br/>quartets, for example, play just triads fairly consistently in the<br/>performance of compositions even from the romantic period, not to<br/>mention classical.</p><p>A conductor &quot;not allowing&quot; a just third in the final triad of a<br/>symphony implies that he/she cares about the difference enough to<br/>disallow such a thing. I find this VERY hard to swallow, since I<br/>detect a HUGE body of symphony conductors who let pitch errors on the<br/>order of 10-14 cents go all the time, and not in the service of JI,<br/>but simply random mistunings. (I would not complain if they were<br/>just.) Where does this kind of assessment come from, Johnny?

I would<br/>&gt; like to run into a collection of such musicians in one place<br/>&gt; sometime.</p><p>Please come visit us in New York.  Here you can meet someone for each and<br/>every instrument who can play with the precision I demand.</p><p>The number of commercially available recordings of<br/>musicians (other than fixed tuned instrumentalists) who play or sing<br/>&gt; with this kind of precision is vanishingly small in my experience. I<br/>&gt; have a few such recordings, but they are exceptional and I wish I had<br/>&gt; more.</p><p>Actually, I do have many, many such recordings in the AFMM archive.  The<br/>business of releasing CDs is a terrible lot and I have been working to have<br/>greater repertoire so that when they do come out there will be the right<br/>apparatus and the necessary demand.  Frankly, demand is still low.  The world<br/>is a bit distracted right now.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, or rather, for the same reason, the statement<br/>&gt; that &quot;no conductor would allow&quot; a just third at the end of a symphony<br/>&gt; movement I find to be a bit hard to swallow.</p><p>As a bassoonist in many orchestras, I know what I can get away with.  This<br/>playing of a Picardy third in a final cadence would never balance the rest of<br/>the piece correctly for a conductor for the Romantic period for certain.  Now<br/>playing bassoon to the piano in Otto Luening&apos;s Sonata for Bassoon was to be<br/>planting just relationships around piano anchors.  This is what Otto wanted.<br/>A bassoonist could never supplant the harmony of an entire piece of music by<br/>injecting a just interval.  An exception I recently heard was a bassist<br/>singing an ascending 7/4 in a Henze opera.</p><p>I have heard string &gt; quartets, for example, play just triads fairly<br/>&gt; consistently in the<br/>&gt; performance of compositions even from the romantic period, not to<br/>&gt; mention classical.<br/>&gt;</p><p>String Quartets are a different matter.  Old studies have demonstrated that<br/>they are more likely to play sharper thirds than flat (e.g., famous Boston<br/>study).  Sure, they can do anything and any leader can ask any which way.<br/>And any composer can have a different preference (e.g., Ives preferred sharp<br/>thirds as a norm, Luening wanted flat thirds).</p><p>&gt; A conductor &quot;not allowing&quot; a just third in the final triad of a<br/>&gt; symphony implies that he/she cares about the difference enough to<br/>&gt; disallow such a thing. I find this VERY hard to swallow, since I<br/>&gt; detect a HUGE body of symphony conductors who let pitch errors on the<br/>&gt; order of 10-14 cents go all the time, and not in the service of JI,<br/>&gt; but simply random mistunings. (I would not complain if they were<br/>&gt; just.)</p><p>Conductors that employ huge vibrato will always camouflage intent.  But do<br/>you think a conductor can have no exact crystal clear concept of where the<br/>intonation should be?  Doesn&apos;t Boulez know?  Simply because it is<br/>expressionistly employed, without apparent rhyme or reason to you and others,<br/>it means there isn&apos;t any?  Nope.  I don&apos;t buy that.  I&apos;m finding connections<br/>between Bach&apos;s choice of keys in Werckmeister and the way Casals plays the<br/>cello suites, even though Casals never consulting the Werckmeister tunings<br/>(to my knowledge).</p><p>Where does this kind of assessment come from, Johnny? Do you<br/>&gt; live on a different planet?<br/>&gt; Respectfully puzzled,<br/>&gt; Bob</p><p>My assessment comes from a singular career in performing microtonal music of<br/>all styles in New York.</p><p>best, Johnny</p></div><h3><a id=37863 href="#37863">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2002 11:17:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Rick Tagawa &lt;ricktagawa@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  13/8    +7.2c   50  2:8</p><p>&gt;  19/13   +7.0c   39  3:6</p><p>&gt;  19/16   -2.5c   18  0:3</p><p>i wouldn&apos;t put too much importance on this table, since, as you can<br/>see from the values above, the numbers don&apos;t even agree with one<br/>another for a simple harmonic series chord like 8:13:19 --</p><p>13/8 is 50 steps;</p><p>19/13 is 39 steps;</p><p>so 19/8 should be 89 steps;</p><p>19/16 should be 89 - 72 = 17 steps;</p><p>but the table says 19/16 is 18 steps!</p><p>so the quality of approximation that the table suggests in the 19-<br/>limit and above is often not acheivable in practice, where chords<br/>(rather than mere dyads) are typically used.</p></div><h3><a id=37864 href="#37864">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/17/2002 11:18:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/17/02 11:26:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; In a message dated 6/16/02 10:04:42 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>&gt; &gt; jpehrson@r... writes:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, my guess *off the top* is that it would be possible in<br/>&gt; slower<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; passages but not necessarily in faster....<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My question is simple to you: what is just sounding, other than<br/>&gt; lack of<br/>&gt; &gt; beats?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if that&apos;s your criterion, then if you play in 72-equal, with<br/>&gt; harmonies going by 4 or 5 per second, there&apos;s no time for beats to<br/>&gt; occur, so then by your own definition it&apos;s just sounding, right?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I never said that is my criterion: I posed a question.

I&apos;m personally<br/>angling (slowly) toward the following 13-limit just blues scale<br/>(using C as an example to make it more concrete) that I have<br/>tentatively defined, where the second number in the ratios refers to<br/>the tonic at 1/1 as is conventional in JI:</p><p>C=1, Eb=7/6, neutral 3rd=11/9, E nat=5/4, F=4/3, F#- = 11/8, F#+ =<br/>13/9, G=3/2, Bb=7/4</p><p>In case the F#+ at 13/9 raises eyebrows, I find the typical F#<br/>leading up to a G in C blues a much higher value than the more<br/>familiar F#- leading down to the F natural. 13/9 puts the perfect<br/>fifth on G in a 27/26 relationship with this F#+, even skinnier than<br/>the &quot;normal&quot; 5-limit chromatic half-step. It also puts the F#+ in a<br/>clean 13/11 relationship with the neutral third.</p><p>In this scale, the famous &quot;flat third&quot; chord spelled in common<br/>practice as C-E-G-Bb-Eb would put the lower E natural and the higher<br/>(2*7)/6 Eb in a 28/15 (4*7/3*5) relationship aligned right along the<br/>harmonic series. I&apos;m interested in playing with polyphonic<br/>counterpoint &quot;a la renaissance&quot; in the context of a generally more<br/>contemporary rhythmic style in this kind of bluesy harmonic context<br/>with all its interesting potential for unique modulation schemes,<br/>etc. and see what falls out, where it leads me esthetically.</p><p>Why use a temperament instead of straight 13-limit JI? ...to liberate<br/>my creative attention, pure and simple.

My conclusion was reached many years ago<br/>using a completely electronic instrument, the Motorola Scalatron.</p><p>It just occurred to me that you and others might be interested in an<br/>experience I had with that instrument some years ago.  The following<br/>text (slightly edited) is from a book I am writing.</p><p>&lt;&lt; In the spring of 1975, when the instrument with the Bosanquet<br/>generalized keyboard was under development, Erv Wilson made a trip to<br/>the factory in Arlington Heights, Illinois to see it.</p><p>While he was there we tried out a tuning in just intonation that he<br/>had just developed (a 20-tone Eikosany, I believe).  The digitally<br/>tuned Scalatron had available 1024 different pitches in the octave in<br/>a subharmonic series, and the actual pitches employed for any tonal<br/>system, whether tempered or just, would usually be an approximation<br/>of the theoretical pitches, with a maximum error ranging from 0.4 to<br/>0.8 cents, depending on which part of the series was required for<br/>each particular tone.  The exception to this is that just intervals<br/>can be made exact if each tone in the system can be matched to one of<br/>the subharmonics in a series from 1025 to 2048, which turned out to<br/>be the case with Erv&apos;s tuning.  The entire tuning could even be put<br/>in the proper &quot;key&quot; by adjusting the frequency of the master<br/>oscillator, the &quot;fundamental&quot; of the series.  Once all of this was<br/>done, all of the pitches were phase-locked into exact ratios.</p><p>When Erv played his phase-locked tuning, it was just intonation such<br/>as I had never heard before, and I would have to describe its effect<br/>as nothing short of amazing.  While his 13-limit tuning in itself was<br/>remarkable, some of the chords had a resonance that surpassed<br/>anything I had ever heard before (or since).  I did not even find any<br/>problem with any stagnant effect.  In one respect the experience<br/>could be compared to viewing an immense crystal from various<br/>directions, with the direction of view changing with each chord.  (It<br/>was not until I subsequently saw Erv&apos;s diagram of this tuning that I<br/>realized how appropriate this description is.)  Each chord seemed to<br/>be a facet and each tone of a chord the corner of a facet, with each<br/>facet having the appearance of the surface of a still pond.  The<br/>slightest movement in the air between the sound source and my ears<br/>had the effect of temporarily disturbing the pond, and even turning<br/>my head produced the slight ripple of a momentary phase shift.  When<br/>one of the workers in the facility walked through the room while Erv<br/>was playing, the effect of the disturbance of the air on the sound<br/>was evident to everyone in the room.</p><p>With the possible exception of the experience produced by the phase-<br/>locked sine waves of the Scalatron synthesizer built for La Monte<br/>Young, just intonation under laboratory conditions such as these is<br/>virtually unattainable in an actual musical performance in what is<br/>ordinarily thought to be just intonation.  The latter is only an<br/>approximation of rational intervals, a _de facto_ temperament, with<br/>the accuracy dependent upon the pitch stability of the instrument<br/>(for instruments of fixed pitch) or the ability of the performer (for<br/>voices, unfretted strings, winds, etc.). &gt;&gt;</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38017 href="#38017">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2002 10:23:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>George,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It just occurred to me that you and others might be interested in<br/>&gt; an experience I had with that instrument some years ago.</p><p>[snip]</p><p>That was a vivid and fascinating anecdote.

Since the crystal was quite stable, the result was very precise tuning, quite precise even for high notes. It sounds as if this idea can be adapted to something other than square waves, and it seems to me this is an idea which still might be worth adopting.</p></div><h3><a id=38066 href="#38066">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2002 9:56:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; George,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; It just occurred to me that you and others might be interested in<br/>&gt; &gt; an experience I had with that instrument some years ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [snip]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That was a vivid and fascinating anecdote.

If starting from the get-go with a compromised<br/>tuning - even if the compromise fits in with what we think/know is<br/>an &apos;accepted&apos; error value - we are crippling at least one kind of<br/>vision.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, whatever. I just really like your experiential exposition,<br/>for a *lot* of reasons!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Try as you wish and try all you want, but I don&apos;t it&apos;s possible to<br/>achieve the phenomenon I described with acoustical (i.e., non-<br/>electronic) instruments.  There are too many variables (or transient<br/>elements) in a performance besides pitch that must also be kept under<br/>control so as not to disturb the effect, and these involve the<br/>audience as well as the performers.  You might be able to come close<br/>for a few fleeting moments here and there, but they would pass by so<br/>quickly that I doubt anyone would notice.</p><p>Perhaps this would be best left to the realm of electronic music, and<br/>let live musicians do what they do best -- playing with expressive<br/>spontaneity.</p><p>But if my experience encourages others to strive to improve their<br/>intonation, then by all means, go for it!  There is at least as much<br/>to be appreciated in the striving for perfection as in perfection<br/>itself.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38108 href="#38108">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2002 11:46:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While he was there we tried out a tuning in just intonation that<br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; had just developed (a 20-tone Eikosany, I believe).  The<br/>digitally<br/>&gt; &gt; tuned Scalatron had available 1024 different pitches in the<br/>octave in<br/>&gt; &gt; a subharmonic series, and the actual pitches employed for any<br/>tonal<br/>&gt; &gt; system, whether tempered or just, would usually be an<br/>approximation<br/>&gt; &gt; of the theoretical pitches, with a maximum error ranging from 0.4<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; 0.8 cents, depending on which part of the series was required for<br/>&gt; &gt; each particular tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I first had a chance to play with electronic microtonality, it<br/>was with a box my brother built which also used undertone tuning; a<br/>frequency counter would count the vibrations of a crystal in the<br/>megahertz range, and then play a square wave in at an undertone of<br/>this ultrahigh frequency. Since the crystal was quite stable, the<br/>result was very precise tuning, quite precise even for high notes. It<br/>sounds as if this idea can be adapted to something other than square<br/>waves, and it seems to me this is an idea which still might be worth<br/>adopting.</p><p>That&apos;s exactly the way it was done on the Motorola Scalatron to<br/>achieve the pitches in the top octave; these were subsequently<br/>divided repeatedly by 2 to get the rest of the octaves.</p><p>Some even-numbered partials were introduced by adding in some square<br/>wave input 1, 2, and 3 octaves higher at lower amplitudes.  In this<br/>way a stairstep waveshape was successfully used to simulate a<br/>sawtooth wave.  The output was then filtered in various ways.</p><p>--George</p></div>
