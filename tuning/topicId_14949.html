So it&apos;s just using the pitch bend for one of the notes for the entire chord!</p><p>Reason it&apos;s happening is that it works out all the channels and pitch bends first,<br/>pitch bends the channels, then plays all the notes at once right at the end, to make<br/>the start of the chord nice and crisp.</p><p>When it works out the channels to use, it&apos;s finding suitable ones for the pitch bends<br/>okay, but then when making a record of the numbers for later use, is recording them<br/>as all the same channel. Some kind of lack of communication between various parts<br/>of the program which I haven&apos;t completely figured out yet.</p><p>I&apos;m just fixing it now - a bit fiddly actually, and I&apos;ll do new versions of all the clips.</p><p>Same applies to the Wave.</p><p>It&apos;s really obvious now you mention it, e.g. 5/4 + 7/4 is way out from what it should be<br/>- matter of hearing what you want to hear I think. Applies to both Wav and Midi versions.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure about that other .Wav bug, but since I&apos;ll be doing all the clips anyway,<br/>it will fix that too.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
