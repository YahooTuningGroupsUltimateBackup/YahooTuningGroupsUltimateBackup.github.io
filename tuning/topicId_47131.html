I wrote a longer e-mail, and my computer<br/>crashed.  I apologize for the cut down explanations, I<br/>can explain more later.</p><p>Here&apos;s the deal:</p><p>Been singing Barbershop for a while, talked this<br/>summer with Dr. Jim Richards, physicist, and author of<br/>&quot;The Physics of Barbershop Sound.&quot;</p><p>My conclusion: idea about Barbershoppers using<br/>adaptive tuning that resembles temperament is crap.<br/>Barbershoppers sing nearly always exact JI ratios.<br/>Here&apos;s how they solve the comma problem:</p><p>When going away from tonic to a chord which will<br/>proceed around the circle of fifths, they raise the<br/>root to a pythagorean note.  the progression<br/>III7-VI7-II7-V7-I has the roots 81/64, 27/16, 9/8, 3/2<br/>and 1/1.  Above these roots are perfect JI chords<br/>7:6:5:4.  This is made easier to sing by the voicing,<br/>example: Bass rarely on the third of the chord, so<br/>almost never sings 5/4, much more often sings 81/64.<br/>When the voicing is unusual is where most quartets<br/>have problems.  But the quartet DOES NOT adjust to<br/>whatever the lead sings.  They adjust to the ROOTS of<br/>the chords, which function generally in a Pythagorean<br/>fashion.</p><p>Additionally, my ear tells me that a ii7 minor seven<br/>chord should actually be made up of 9/8, 21/16, 27/16,<br/>63/32.  This chord provides complete smooth voice<br/>leading and held notes to a barbershop 7th chord on V<br/>(3/2).  Thus the issue of what is the ii chord is<br/>solved.</p><p>My sense tells me that nearly everything musically can<br/>be done with exact JI ratios.  I think the unsolved<br/>delimma of comma problems is people looking in the<br/>wrong places.  I think that good voice leading avoids<br/>the weirdest of problems and that if it can&apos;t be<br/>solved by voice leading and further out adjustments<br/>WITHIN strict ratios, it probably doesn&apos;t sound good<br/>period.  I think the use of temperament is only good<br/>for two things: practical use of instruments, and<br/>ambiguity (a valid artistic goal).</p><p>Feel free to challenge my ideas or ask further<br/>questions.

Additionally, what is apparently unclear is how<br/>adjustments by comma take place.</p><p>Granted there may be exceptions, the essential functioning of a<br/>barbershop arrangement avoids most comma shifts by putting<br/>the new note in a different part, usually in a different octave.<br/>Simply because the parts tend to stay on similar parts of the<br/>chord, when E changes from being a third of a chord to a root, it<br/>usually is not held over, but rather appears in a different part.<br/>Certainly many notes are held over through chords, but once the<br/>SINGLE jump in root has been made after leaving tonic, the<br/>circle of fifths progression back no longer needs any shifts.</p><p>As for the accuracy, certainly we are dealing with real world, but I<br/>am pretty confident that I can accurately sing 81/64 instead of 5/4<br/>when appropriate.  For the most part, the bass often has the root<br/>and generally sings 81/64 because 5/4 would only occur with a<br/>tonic chord (because barbershop harmony uses relative minor<br/>and mediant chords far less often than dominant circle of fifths<br/>chords).  The other parts do not actually need to hear the root to<br/>sing correctly, they only need to sense that the harmony needs to<br/>be based on 81/64, and they will sing JI intervals for that chord.</p><p>I believe that every successful barbershop arrangement<br/>(meaning that excellent barbershoppers could comfortably sing<br/>it) could be spelled out in strict JI.</p><p>And the most controversial statement I&apos;m making is this:  If it<br/>cannot be spelled in strict JI, then I believe it is either completely<br/>innaccessible music that does not have real musical function, or<br/>(more likely) its musical function relies on ambiguity and<br/>vagueness.  Put another way, if a piece is not intended to be<br/>vague (for various musical reasons) then it can be spelled in<br/>STRICT JI.</p><p>I&apos;ll form this as a question/challenge:  can you find a musical<br/>phrase that could be both impossible to have in strict JI, and<br/>also completely clear and precise as far as pitch intention as<br/>percieved by the intended audience?  (surely you as a composer<br/>could truly intend that exact 11EDO note, but could a listener<br/>understand it that way?)</p><p>Oh and to answer your question, I did not take Dr. Richards&apos;<br/>class.  I hope to at some point, but I did have a lengthy<br/>discussion with him about my perceptions and questions, and<br/>I&apos;ve read his book.</p><p>Thanks for the excellent thoughts everyone, keep &apos;em coming.</p><p>Aaron<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The official definition of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; may be found at...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/adaptiveji.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/adaptiveji.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=47145 href="#47145">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2003 6:55:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>...<br/>&gt; And the most controversial statement I&apos;m making is this:  If it<br/>&gt; cannot be spelled in strict JI, then I believe it is either completely<br/>&gt; innaccessible music that does not have real musical function, or<br/>&gt; (more likely) its musical function relies on ambiguity and<br/>&gt; vagueness.

I will keep studying and come back at some future<br/>time with any new thoughts.</p><p>I can quickly respond to a couple things though:</p><p>By vague affect I mean that the chord itself has a clear musical<br/>affect without considering the broad context.  That a typical<br/>trained listener would know exactly what the chord&apos;s expression<br/>is without any context.</p><p>I think that the chords in jazz or Bach, or other examples which<br/>do not translate to strict JI, function by being vague.  In other<br/>words, when a tempered note is not clearly implying one JI note<br/>over another that allows the music to proceed in either/any<br/>direction.  It is this ability that creates the affect.  Because the<br/>&quot;vague&quot; note or chord only completes its clarity of affect after the<br/>context is established.</p><p>I believe this to be a completely useful musical tool.  But I also<br/>believe that composers and musicians should be careful only to<br/>use temperament when this is the goal.  The only other musical<br/>value of temperament that I&apos;m aware of (besides the practicality<br/>for instrument design and playability) is the out-of-tune feel when<br/>a note is intentionally not JI in order to have the buzz/ring/beating<br/>etc. that out of tune notes produce.  This is also a valid musical<br/>use of temperament.</p><p>I&apos;m very curious if people have more to add to this list of uses of<br/>temperament.  But what seems wrong to me is this idea:  &quot;but<br/>temperament is necessary because how else could you have<br/>this chord: (x-x-x-whatever)&quot;  My feeling is still that what you need<br/>beyond JI is vagueness, or chorus effects, or practicality, but I<br/>don&apos;t believe you actually want/need that specific chord that<br/>somehow can&apos;t work in JI.  A question:  out of context, how can<br/>anyone actually KNOW they want this or that chord if it isn&apos;t clear<br/>in JI??</p><p>I simply can&apos;t imagine someone sitting down to write a piece and<br/>deciding to want any non-JI chord without it being defined by<br/>either context or technical/theoretical concept.</p><p>Furthermore, I believe that if a chord that results from context /<br/>voice-leading cannot be done well in JI that either the composer<br/>should desire vagueness or should admit that it is bad<br/>voice-leading and produces an unclear chord.</p><p>My main hypothesis goes both directions:  I propose first that<br/>many seemingly unclear chords in JI can be made to work<br/>convincingly with beyond the most obvious of ratio choices.<br/>Secondly, I hypothesize that (as an example) the theoretical<br/>problems with the progression IV-II-V-I in JI result from EITHER<br/>an unwillingness to define the IV or II chords as quite different<br/>from the strict scale tones, OR a problem with the progression<br/>altogether.  Perhaps that is a lousy progression that only works<br/>in temperament because of the vagueness and really actually<br/>needs an additional passing chord in there to function well.</p><p>I will have to experiment to see if I can make that progression<br/>convincing to myself in strict JI.  What I have trouble accepting is<br/>this:  That the progression is somehow logical and clear even if<br/>it can&apos;t be done in JI.  It is definitely musical, sure.</p><p>Ok, the final wording:  I have trouble believing that anyone would<br/>ever come up with, and desire to use, progressions that fail in JI<br/>unless the origin of the progression is in a technical idea that<br/>was then forced into the music.  I will grant that musical value<br/>can be found from incorporating the technical ideas, but I still<br/>insist that it is the musical value of vagueness itself rather than<br/>some other new musical expression.  I&apos;m not making a claim as<br/>to how much of the or which examples are vague, technically<br/>derived ones vs. ones that have less obvious JI realizations.</p><p>Sorry I don&apos;t have the time to work this through more right away.<br/>If anything I&apos;ve said could be clarified though, please let me know<br/>and I&apos;ll attempt it.

Sometime an innervoice seems totally at<br/>lost, even though it is not auditorily obvious at all (for me, but I<br/>am not an example of good ear).</p><p>I think that in any ensemble, the most likely &quot;natural leader&quot; is the<br/>most self assured voice (the one with absolute or nearest to absolute<br/>pitch?). In some (extreme) case it may be an inner voice if this inner<br/>voice is song by someone more experienced than the rest of the group.</p><p>&gt; Aaron :<br/>&gt; They adjust to the ROOTS of the chords, which function generally in<br/>a Pythagorean<br/>&gt; fashion.</p><p>I do not buy the Pythagorean scale for singers. For violin family<br/>perhaps, due to the tuning in fifth, but not for singer. Anyway, at<br/>reachable pitch measurement accuracy, and with the great interval<br/>variability of any given signer, it is difficult to distinguish<br/>Pythagorean from ET interval. I think (without any proof) that the<br/>pervasiveness of ET induces mental representation of melodic interval<br/>as ET.</p><p>Anyways, I totally agree that whatever is the actual intonation, any a<br/>capella ensemble are strongly attracted to simple ratios, so if there<br/>is no fix pitch instrument around, there is no real tendency to settle<br/>around a given &quot;temperament&quot;. There is a lot of fiddling around to the<br/>point that a given note in the same piece may be song at many very<br/>different pitches.</p><p>Singing just (simple) harmonic intervals is, in my mind and<br/>experience, a natural tendency. Signing just melodic interval is<br/>completely another game. For reasons I do not know, on the average,<br/>there is a tendency to sing larger interval downward than upward<br/>(&quot;going south&quot;). Staying in pitch is more a fight against this<br/>tendency to drift (melodicaly) downward that to compensate a<br/>theoritical comma drift to &quot;adapt&quot; JI to some chord progression.</p><p>The actual intonation of 7th chord depends on a lot of factors. One of<br/>the most important is the ensemble spacial setting and room accoustic.<br/>It is probably &quot;relatively&quot; easy to get to 4:5:6:7 when singer are on<br/>a circle, facing each other. But on usual, in line stage setting, of<br/>let say TTBB, the upper voice T1 shall be physicaly near T2, so that<br/>the B2 is not clearly perceived. In this case the 6:5 may be a much<br/>stronger &quot;attractor&quot; than 7:6 for T1:T2. That may be explained because<br/>6:5 has a lower &quot;local harmonic entropy&quot; even though it raises the<br/>&quot;global entropy&quot;. It can be explain more simply by just saying that<br/>6:5 is more common to western music than 7:6...</p><p>Things get even harder when there is more than a singer per part,<br/>because disagreement may appear within each part. Singer on the border<br/>of a section may have an auditory landscape quite diffrent from one<br/>within the section.</p><p>As an amateur choir singer I had extremely bad experiences of some<br/>inverted dom7th chord in &quot;acousticaly challenging environment&quot; (nearly<br/>impossible to hear upper voices) on the chord inversion where T:B are<br/>just a tone appart, but which tone? 6:7? 9:10? 8:9? 15:18? plain ET? A<br/>lot of work needed to get to an agreement an produce just a &quot;decent<br/>chord&quot; whatever that mean.</p><p>For sure, training and rehearsal can enhance a lot this tendency in<br/>&quot;acousticaly challenging environment&quot;. The &quot;real nature of JI harmony&quot;<br/>is a question on the borderline of the nature/culture debate. I my<br/>opinion, (without any proof) I think that triadic JI is mostly<br/>&quot;nature&quot;, but whenever we go beyond triadic harmony, we enter the<br/>&quot;culture&quot; area. In other words, actual realizatioons of 7th chord may<br/>differ largely, depending on training, genre, stage setting etc.</p><p>Yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3><a id=47221 href="#47221">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

I&apos;ll<br/>try to do this short and simple:</p><p>First, that other theory is a complete myth.  The lead is followed<br/>for other things, interpretation, etc. but the tuning is more often<br/>set by the bass, but it is really set only by the various parts<br/>understanding their part of the chord and the chord relative to<br/>tonic.  This myth of lead/melody set tuning is mostly spread by<br/>tuning people or inexperienced singers.  Please everyone stop<br/>spreading it.  ANY top-notch (really top-notch) barbershopper will<br/>tell you the same thing I am saying.  I&apos;ve talked to many myself.</p><p>Barbershop cannot be directly compared to other choral singing.<br/>Barbershop is all about perfect harmonic tuning above nearly<br/>any other aspect of the music.  And no vibrato.  And 35% plus of<br/>a good barbershop piece is 7:6:5:4 chords, which any good<br/>barbershopper could tune without carefully standing in a square.</p><p>Also to clarify the pythagorean issue, the circle of fifths style<br/>III-VI-II-V-I progression is common in barbershop, where the<br/>roots of such a progression must be pythagorean to not go flat.  I<br/>have even tested singing 81/64 vs. 5/4 to unknowing<br/>barbershoppers who have repeatedly successfully identified<br/>whether I jumped to a III chord or stayed on tonic just from the<br/>one bass note.  Other progressions and other parts are<br/>decidedly not pythagorean.</p><p>I further assert (my ideas now) that choral music that does not<br/>do as much to have careful tuning is lousy or intentionally vague.<br/>Many choirs go flat, have too much vibrato, etc. etc. and this in my<br/>view should not be studied to understand the tuning affect of the<br/>music.  Only the top choirs that represent the intended ideal of<br/>the music should be studied.  What THEY do is more likely worth<br/>understanding from a tuning perspective and other choirs<br/>thought of as not quite acheiving the correct tuning.  Obviously<br/>there&apos;s still questionable, complex elements, but I believe that if<br/>the choir can&apos;t sing it just then the only musical function is<br/>vagueness (my case all along).</p><p>Anyway, what I do know is barbershop, and I hope it&apos;s been clear<br/>when I postulating my own hypotheses and when I&apos;m trying to<br/>impart factual information so people on the tuning list can be<br/>more clear when referencing barbershop.</p></div><h3><a id=47224 href="#47224">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

I&apos;m suggesting<br/>that maybe all progressions outside of JI function based on their<br/>level of ambiguity but do not in any other way impart a particular<br/>musical affect!  This mixed with progressions close enough to JI<br/>to truly imply JI can produce excellent music.  This music in my<br/>view functions on the various affects of the different JI<br/>relationships plus ambiguity of the other parts.  What I don&apos;t<br/>believe is that the non-JI parts can have the variety of musical<br/>affect that differing JI relationships produce.  I think that<br/>vagueness overshadows any other feeling a listener might have.<br/>But I also think that the tension and release of the vague<br/>progression into a JI-implied one is a valid and excellent<br/>musical goal.</p><p>Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

The lead is followed<br/>&gt;for other things, interpretation, etc. but the tuning is more often<br/>&gt;set by the bass, but it is really set only by the various parts<br/>&gt;understanding their part of the chord and the chord relative to<br/>&gt;tonic.  This myth of lead/melody set tuning is mostly spread by<br/>&gt;tuning people or inexperienced singers.  Please everyone stop<br/>&gt;spreading it.</p><p>I must be mixing my Aarons.  Didn&apos;t you start this thread by<br/>claiming that the roots of JI chords were rooted on pythagorean<br/>Lead tones in Barbershop?</p><p>&gt;ANY top-notch (really top-notch) barbershopper will<br/>&gt;tell you the same thing I am saying.

I would have to say that I think what Mathieu<br/>says makes sense to me.  That temperament allows for a<br/>&quot;strange, magical (whatever)&quot; jump between otherwise distant<br/>harmonic relationships.  But I believe there is some sort of<br/>sleight of ear that allows this, that the listener is missing the<br/>whole picture of what is happening.  The listener is not as<br/>confident in being really inside the music as in JI.  But that in no<br/>way degrades the usefulness of such an effect.  My feeling is that<br/>even a tempered major chord has a degree of &quot;vagueness&quot; that<br/>JI does not have, and this will be there whether we discuss a<br/>single somewhat vague chord or a progression of them.</p><p>I also find it interesting that barbershop harmony (one of the<br/>most tuning conscious styles I know of) is absent of many of the<br/>seemingly simple temperament-needing progressions that<br/>you&apos;re talking about.

On your end do you<br/>think you could send a recording in which one of these<br/>progressions you&apos;re mentioning is done with each chord having<br/>clarity and resonance even similar to that of barbershop?

I&apos;ve sung in many<br/>groups over the years with this feeling too.  However, I would<br/>also agree my barbershop description is different.  Barbershop<br/>is extremely unique and I have trouble comparing it to any other<br/>style of western choral music.  The clarity and resonance of<br/>Barbershop is beyond what I&apos;ve experienced in nearly any other<br/>context.</p><p>As far as using specific notes etc.  my barbershop ear tells me<br/>that 81/64 and 5/4 are two different notes, and it&apos;d rankle my ear<br/>to hear one of them slide or be off.  They do not function in the<br/>same section of the music and they each have a unique feel and<br/>musical pull.  In barbershop Basses are used to singing 81/64<br/>because arrangers almost never give them 5/4.  Thus a typical<br/>barbershop problem is that when a bass has to be on the third<br/>of a chord (5/4) there is often difficulty.  But the best singer will<br/>remember that the note in that place is a different note.  They do<br/>not think only &quot;I have to sing flatter&quot; they lower their pitch until they<br/>get the feeling and sense of this new note and remember its<br/>feeling.  I believe (I&apos;ll do tests when I get the tools) that an<br/>excellent bass will clearly sing a different pitch depending on<br/>whether they are on the third of the chord or not if they know the<br/>song well even when singing alone.  I think barbershoppers<br/>learn not just to adapt pitches, but to identify by feeling far more<br/>than 12 discreet pitches which are needed both for context and<br/>could alone imply the surrounding context when sing alone.</p></div><h3><a id=47292 href="#47292">ðŸ”—</a>backfromthesilo &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2003 8:35:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Francois,  I wish it weren&apos;t so but I doubt they are available in<br/>most CD stores.

They do not function in the<br/>&gt; same section of the music and they each have a unique feel and<br/>&gt; musical pull.  In barbershop Basses are used to singing 81/64<br/>&gt; because arrangers almost never give them 5/4.  Thus a typical<br/>&gt; barbershop problem is that when a bass has to be on the third<br/>&gt; of a chord (5/4) there is often difficulty.  But the best singer<br/>will<br/>&gt; remember that the note in that place is a different note.  They do<br/>&gt; not think only &quot;I have to sing flatter&quot; they lower their pitch<br/>until they<br/>&gt; get the feeling and sense of this new note and remember its<br/>&gt; feeling.  I believe (I&apos;ll do tests when I get the tools) that an<br/>&gt; excellent bass will clearly sing a different pitch depending on<br/>&gt; whether they are on the third of the chord or not if they know the<br/>&gt; song well even when singing alone.  I think barbershoppers<br/>&gt; learn not just to adapt pitches, but to identify by feeling far<br/>more<br/>&gt; than 12 discreet pitches which are needed both for context and<br/>&gt; could alone imply the surrounding context when sing alone.</p><p>***To Paul and others:  When Jerry Eskelin was doing his testing on<br/>the &quot;high third&quot; did we determine that the &quot;high third&quot; was closer to<br/>81/64 than to 5/4, or was is someplace inbetween.

I had my roommates listen<br/>without telling them anything about what this was and the<br/>response was that if anything, the adaptive one was weird and<br/>wrong while most of the others (besides the STUPID ones like<br/>4/3 going to 27/20) sounded just different but all ok.  Maybe that&apos;s<br/>just a bad example of adaptive tuning.</p><p>Anyway, my second point is that, as logical and simple and<br/>common as this progression seems, and while it certainly<br/>doesn&apos;t brake any arranging rules, this exact arrangement of<br/>notes is not something I think I recall ever hearing in<br/>barbershop.  I think this progression would simply sound better<br/>with some revoicing between chords.  I think the result would be<br/>a better sound, with the same harmonic feeling and less<br/>weirdness.  And I don&apos;t see why revoicing would be considered<br/>any more radical a solution than applying some form of adaptive<br/>tuning!</p><p>Anyway, I really tried to be objective and I think that if I HAD to<br/>have these notes in this exact sequence, I&apos;d choose the JI<br/>version where 4/3 dips to 21/16.

I had my roommates listen<br/>&gt; without telling them anything about what this was and the<br/>&gt; response was that if anything, the adaptive one was weird and<br/>&gt; wrong while most of the others (besides the STUPID ones like<br/>&gt; 4/3 going to 27/20) sounded just different but all ok.  Maybe<br/>that&apos;s<br/>&gt; just a bad example of adaptive tuning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***That&apos;s funny, since, as I recall, the adaptive one that Dave<br/>Keenan dreamed up seemed the smoothest of all.  I guess I&apos;ll listen<br/>to all of them again...</p><p>J.
