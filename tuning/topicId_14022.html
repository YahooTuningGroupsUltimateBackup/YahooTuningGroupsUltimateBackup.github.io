Andrew Barker used epimoric in Greek Musical Writings        -</p><p>&gt; I should have said that I could not find a logarithmic interpretation of it<br/>&gt; either. I simply cannot figure out what it is trying to show. What is the<br/>&gt; significance of not reducing the 4/4 and so ending up with a tree that does<br/>&gt; not seem to be a section of the Stern-Brocot tree as it claims, since<br/>&gt; fractions connected by lines are not adjacent.</p><p>He wanted to use the scale tree to examine the tetrachord. 4/4 being in the same octave,<br/>producing notes whose reduction of terms creates intervals separated by epimores. I need to<br/>look at it more. I am sure that in turn he is aware of the noble numbers that would be created<br/>by such a sequence.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My question is not so much _whether_ Wilson has applied the Stern-Brocot<br/>&gt; tree to both fractions of an octave and frequency ratios, but what musical<br/>&gt; or psycho-acoustic significance he gives to the noble numbers in each case.</p><p>This is what I remember of his history with this which I would take with a grain of salt but<br/>at least includes these details . I am sure there is more that i don&apos;t know or have forgotten.<br/>Originally I know he was taken by Yasser&apos;s sequence and Kornerup&apos;s extension. Noticing how the<br/>Indians used a 22 tone scale, he added this part of the tree on to the Yasser zig-zag and saw<br/>how it was related.. After examining different parts of the tree involving other generators<br/>besides the fifth, he finally reconstructed the whole tree, knowing that he could not had been<br/>the first one to create such an object, he first found it described by Pierce.<br/>    I will have to ask him about an application of acoustic besides of it just being a good<br/>reference to ratios. It seems that an approach to adding intervals can be done by layers as<br/>opposed to limits. A practice not out of the spirit of some greek and especially Persian<br/>musical thought. I assume your own thoughts might pass along this territory. If the noble<br/>numbers are maximum dissonance then dissonance can be measured by the degree or number of<br/>layers a particular ratio is found as opposed to limit. If nothing else it shows what<br/>intervals offer a good choice if one is inserting a ratio between the two. These are my<br/>thoughts.<br/>    Erv as long as I have known him has never really taken any stand as far as consonance and<br/>dissonance. For him ( this is only my experience) the influences of other parameters are so<br/>high that nothing comes as being strong enough in enough cases to warrant him coming up with a<br/>theory. I think Erv is far more concerned with melody than harmony.<br/>    Sorry if I digressed, it is not something i can totally answered. When he gave the tree to<br/>me he told me it can be used in both ways. Over the years he has always pointed out when i<br/>failed to see it both sides, reminding me not to be close minded.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
