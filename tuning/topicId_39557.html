If you<br/>were to use one on an electronic keyboard instrument, it wouldn&apos;t<br/>have to be as long and bulky as one with a conventional keyboard.  So<br/>it does have a distinct advantage.</p><p>&gt; The whole tone system was considered by several accordion<br/>&gt; manufacturers when chromatic accordions first came out, (as well as<br/>&gt; the piano keyboard which is still made today) but the minor third<br/>&gt; system ruled it out completely. In fact a whole tone keyboard for<br/>&gt; accordions was resurrected in the 50&apos;s or 60&apos;s but even though<br/>plenty<br/>&gt; of players tried, nobody fell for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you ever talked to an accordion player about this? Most button<br/>&gt; players would be able to show you in a minute many things that<br/>cannot<br/>&gt; be played on the piano keyboard, and even many piano accordion<br/>players<br/>&gt; admit that the minor third button system is better.</p><p>But that&apos;s not true if you make a mirror image of it and put it on<br/>the left side of the instrument, in which configuration it becomes<br/>the &quot;bassetti&quot; free bass system.  Without the use of the thumb, the<br/>fingering patterns are very clumsy, and it takes a lot of practice to<br/>play smoothly.  It found a market because it enabled a player to do<br/>things that couldn&apos;t be done on a conventional bass-and-chord<br/>(Stradella) button system.</p><p>A much better left-hand accordion layout is the Moschino free bass<br/>system, in which the rows have buttons a *major third* apart, and<br/>which has an even closer octave distance than the bassetti system.  I<br/>have a diagram my modified Bosanquet accordion button proposal with<br/>it:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/BassComp.gif</p><p>In the Moschino system (lower half of diagram), the low notes are at<br/>the left (whereas on a diagram of the bassetti system they would be<br/>at the *right*, since it is a *mirror image* of the chromatic<br/>keyboard).  It should be noted that, in my generalized modified<br/>Bosanquet proposal in the upper half of the diagram, the octaves are<br/>approximately the same distance apart as they are on the bassetti<br/>system.  Further information for both of these was given in an<br/>earlier message:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38287">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38287</a></p><p>It is important to note that the arrangements of buttons in these two<br/>systems work well *only* for the left hand, and they are intended to<br/>simplify the fingering in a situation in which the thumb cannot be<br/>used.</p><p>&gt; I do not think there is such a critical difference between the<br/>&gt; accordion and horizontally placed keyboards, touch sensitive or not.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; It is a mere mechanical reason pianos were not built that way, which<br/>&gt; technology has long since gone bye.</p><p>The piano inherited its keyboard from the harpsichord, clavichord,<br/>and organ, and by the time it appeared the keyboard was too well<br/>established for a new proposal to be considered practical.  (After<br/>all, how many people would be willing to carry their own special<br/>piano around with them?)  So even if the mechanism for a chromatic<br/>layout were not a problem, it still wouldn&apos;t have happened.</p><p>It is the accordion&apos;s portability that makes innovations in that<br/>instrument much more practical.</p><p>&gt; Players can only benefit from<br/>&gt; having the same system and the minor third system is one that<br/>already<br/>&gt; is in use-on accordions.</p><p>But what we need now is a *keyboard* (singular) that will benefit<br/>players who wish to use alternative tuning *systems* (plural), not<br/>another *keyboard* (singlar) for *12-ET* (singular).  I think it<br/>would be more in our interest to advocate a Bosanquet keyboard on the<br/>accordion and elsewhere.  A chromatic keyboard is not going to make<br/>alternative tuning systems more practical, nor will the experience of<br/>learning 12-ET on a chromatic keyboard enable anyone to play any<br/>alternative tuning systems that have other than 12 tones in the<br/>octave.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/14/2002 2:19:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/14/02 2:43:21 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; what we need now is a *keyboard* (singular) that will benefit<br/>&gt; players who wish to use alternative tuning *systems* (plural), not<br/>&gt; another *keyboard* (singlar) for *12-ET* (singular).</p><p>George,</p><p>The Phillips JI and JT scales I posted here will play on a regualr keyboard,<br/>providing 12 small split digitals--5 black keys above and 7 white keys<br/>below--are added.
