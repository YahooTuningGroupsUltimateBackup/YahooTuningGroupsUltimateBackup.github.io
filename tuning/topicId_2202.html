It will pick<br/>D1 or D2 (along with the tuning of all other notes) as needed for the<br/>particular chord(s) being played.</p><p>This first version expects to find a General MIDI (GM) capable device<br/>on output, either a sound card or an external GM MIDI synth.  Tuning is<br/>effected with pitch-bend messages, so only one voice (patch, program)<br/>can be sounding at one time.  One can, of course, change from voice to<br/>voice while running the program.</p><p>Retuning is done in a presettable space of time; I typically use about<br/>250 msec, so that when a continuously sounding note must change<br/>frequency, it&apos;s not done all at once.</p><p>I&apos;ll be glad to make this program available to anyone who wants to<br/>experience JI on the fly.  Distribution is a bit of a problem, however,<br/>since I don&apos;t have a fully functioning web site.  For now, anyone may<br/>e-mail me at <a href="mailto:102074.2214@compuserve.com">102074.2214@compuserve.com</a> and I&apos;ll be glad to forward a<br/>copy.  If you have a PGP public key, please send it to me; otherwise,<br/>I&apos;ll include the program, zipped, as a binary attachment.</p><p>Of course, I haven&apos;t finished many things that I hope to complete over<br/>time, including after-the-fact retuning of a sequence with knowledge<br/>both forward and backward in time.  Standard MIDI file I/O is also not<br/>yet supported.  Nor are ET inputs other than 12-tET.  Still, I think<br/>that the program provides something of interest for tuning enthusiasts!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/1999 6:44:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To:      <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>From:    John deLaubenfels<br/>Subject: Adaptive<br/>JI<br/>Date:    04-07-99</p><p>Yesterday I announced that JI Relay is available.<br/>Thanks to hints from<br/>Manuel Op de Coul, I have succeeded in uploading it to<br/>the file area<br/>of the tuning list.

Then the maximum<br/>&gt; amount of slide needed would be reduced by a factor of 4,<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t it?</p><p>The thing that&apos;s so beautiful about JI is that you can<br/>play around with the subtle differences between notes<br/>that are this close together.</p><p>Try listening the the example of modulation that<br/>Fox-Strangways sent Partch, and that Partch quoted<br/>in _Genesis_.</p><p>Partch says that he played this example for a roomful<br/>of people, with 3 different tunings for the &apos;second&apos;<br/>of the new key (the 3:2 of the old key) -</p><p>1) as a 10:9 all the way thru the modulation,<br/>2) as a  9:8 all the way thru, and<br/>3) as a 10:9 in the ii chord and a 9:8 in<br/>the V chord,</p><p>and no one in the audience failed to notice that<br/>a modulation had taken place.  Partch even remarks<br/>gleefully that one man recognized the 3 different<br/>qualities in the examples.</p><p>To give it my subjective opinion:</p><p>1) the first method, sustaining the 10:9, sustains<br/>a &apos;flatness&apos; into the V chord that gives a sort of<br/>lingering memory of the old key.  The V chord is<br/>noticeably out of tune but it resolves into the<br/>new key before one can really know what happened.</p><p>2) the second method, sustaining the 9:8, makes the<br/>&apos;ii&apos; consonant in the V chord, but brings it in as<br/>a sharp (meaning higher in pitch) dissonance first<br/>on the ii chord.  This gives some sense of surprise<br/>and anticipation at hearing the ii chord, then a<br/>quick resolution when the V comes next as a consonance.<br/>The new key does not come as much as a surprise as<br/>in method 1, because the it was anticipated.</p><p>In a sense both methods give an anticipation of the<br/>new key, but in the first method it&apos;s with *all but one*<br/>of the notes in the chord, so that it&apos;s the one note<br/>left over from the old key that sticks out like a<br/>sore thumb; in the second method it&apos;s with *only one*<br/>note.  So there is a qualitative difference between<br/>the two approaches that can certainly serve musically<br/>expressive purposes.</p><p>3) the third method tunes the &apos;ii&apos; as a 10:9 in the<br/>ii chord and as a 9:8 in the V chord, so there is<br/>no *harmonic* dissonance.  This time the dissonance<br/>is melodic, as a perceptive listener can hear the<br/>comma difference between the &apos;ii&apos; note in the two chords.</p><p>So the point is, in 5-limit JI there are (at least)<br/>these 3 different ways to effect a modulation, and<br/>each one has what I would say is a different *affect*.</p><p>And of course, by going a little further along the<br/>lattice-vectors and including higher exponents even<br/>in 5-limit JI, you can use other &apos;synonomous&apos; notes<br/>in your modulations.  And increasing the odd-/prime-limit<br/>gives multitudes of more different possibilties.</p><p>Of course, using adaptive-JI harmonies over meantone<br/>roots is also a viable idea - sounds like an interesting<br/>tuning.  But with so many possibilities available,<br/>why stick limits on yourself without giving them a<br/>musical purpose?</p><p>That&apos;s why it always bugs me when I read &apos;optimal tuning&apos;.</p><p>As Parch said, and as I used to quote in my signature,</p><p>&gt; The ability of the human ear is vastly underestimated.</p><p>I would emphasize the *vastly*.</p><p>Many scientists say that graphing experimental data<br/>to pitched sound rather than lines or points on paper<br/>gives one an ability to perceive differences that is<br/>far more sensitive than what the eyes can see.</p><p>At any rate, it certainly allows us to perceive<br/>*different* patterns in the data than what the eyes know.</p><p>-Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/10/1999 5:59:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[In td 137, Brett Barbaro wrote:]<br/>&gt; John A. deLaubenfels described how he would &quot;slide&quot; the D from 10/9 to<br/>&gt; 9/8 if the harmony changed from ii to V.

For<br/>example, a simple I-iii-V-I progression doesn&apos;t require any &quot;retune motion&quot; to be rendered<br/>in JI, (the old-fashioned way -- just use the ratios 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8) while<br/>you would render it thus:</p><p>                     Absolute       Centered        Retune<br/>                       tuning         tuning        motion<br/>                      (cents)        (cents)        (cents)<br/>                     --------       --------       --------<br/>   C major (I)<br/>     C                000.00         003.91           n/a<br/>     E                386.31         390.22           n/a<br/>     G                701.96         705.87           n/a<br/>   E minor (iii)<br/>     B               1101.96        1096.09           n/a<br/>     E                400.00         394.13          +3.91<br/>     G                715.65         709.78          +3.91<br/>   G major (V)<br/>     D                201.96         205.87           n/a<br/>     G                700.00         703.91          -5.87<br/>     B               1086.31        1090.22          -5.87<br/>   C major (I)<br/>     C                000.00         003.91           n/a<br/>     E                386.31         390.22           n/a<br/>     G                701.96         705.87          +1.96</p><p>Now I don&apos;t consider any of those retune motions audibly significant, but the 11.74-cent<br/>one in the first progression above might be significant under super-sensitive listening<br/>conditions. Now let&apos;s see what happens when instead of basing everything on 12-tET, we use<br/>1/4-comma meantone. The C-major scale, instead of 0 200 400 500 700 900 1100, is 0 193.16<br/>386.31 503.42 696.58 889.74 1082.89.</p><p>The idea I&apos;ve been trying to explain to you, tuning the roots in meantone, is equivalent<br/>to your &quot;absolute tuning&quot; column, except using meantone in place of 12-tET. As shown in<br/>the second column below, the &quot;retune motion&quot; involved in making each chord JI<br/>(harmonically) is never more than 5.38 cents, or 1/4 of a comma, less than half the<br/>maximum &quot;retune motion&quot; in your method. I also tried applying your centering idea with<br/>respect to meantone, but that increases the maximum &quot;retune motion,&quot; as shown in the<br/>fourth column below:</p><p>                     Absolute        Retune         Centered       Retune<br/>                       tuning        motion         tuning         motion<br/>                      (cents)        (cents)        (cents)        (cents)<br/>                     --------       --------       --------       --------<br/>   C major (I)<br/>     C                000.00           n/a         -001.79           n/a<br/>     E                386.31           n/a          384.52           n/a<br/>     G                701.96           n/a          700.16           n/a<br/>   A minor (vi)<br/>     C                005.38          +5.38         005.38          +7.17<br/>     E                391.69          +5.38         391.69          +7.17<br/>     A                889.74           n/a          889.74           n/a<br/>   D minor (ii)<br/>     D                193.16           n/a          193.16           n/a<br/>     F                508.80           n/a          508.80           n/a<br/>     A                895.11          +5.37         895.11          +5.38<br/>   G major (V)<br/>     D                198.53          +5.37         196.74          +3.58<br/>     G                696.58           n/a          694.79           n/a<br/>     B               1082.89           n/a         1081.10           n/a<br/>   C major (I)<br/>     C                000.00           n/a         -001.79           n/a<br/>     E                386.31           n/a          384.52           n/a<br/>     G                701.96          +5.38         700.16          +5.38</p><p>Now for the progression where straight JI would have had no &quot;retune motion&quot;, my way still<br/>has a lower maximum &quot;retune motion&quot; than your way.

Nevertheless, this method is extremely convenient<br/>and close enough to suit my ear.</p><p>In my (as yet unwritten) leisure retuning software I intend to pay more<br/>strict attention to retune motion, and to &quot;drift&quot; the average tuning<br/>center as best suits the piece on the fly, attempting to balance the<br/>pain of drift vs. the pain of retune motion (also vs. pain of chords<br/>that for one reason or another can&apos;t be fully JI tuned).</p><p>The software I&apos;ve been describing in these posts is real-time, with<br/>no knowledge of how long the current set of notes will sound (nor, of<br/>course, what will follow!).  It decides what to do as if the notes now<br/>sounding will go on for a long time, and therefore acts not to minimize<br/>one-time transition, but rather to center and tune this chord as best<br/>possible.  I do not claim that minimum motion results, only that<br/>less-than-comma motion results most of the time.</p><p>I do see that your approach does a good job of cutting down on retune<br/>motion.  I am curious: how do you handle rampant modulations?  A circle<br/>of fifths, for example; or a progression from C major to E major to G#<br/>major?</p><p>&gt; So, are we starting to make sense to each other?</p><p>Yes, I think so.  By the way, do you have a web site?

I advocate meantone, not ET, to best handle wandering tonics<br/>and 6/9 chords. The second example is an augmented triad, which is more<br/>controversial but is a stack of two major thirds (5:4) and in 12-ET the<br/>outer notes form a tolerable minor sixth (8:5). I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too<br/>horrible in LucyTuning, though, where one of the major thirds must be 436<br/>cents, very nearly a 9:7 (435 cents).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;and to balance the conflicting demands of harmonic and melodic<br/>&gt;&gt;perfection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Again an example of some actual music (preferable the actual notes in here<br/>&gt;rather than a reference to a piece of music).

Also, I<br/>find identical tetrachords melodically &quot;perfect&quot; as opposed to ones in which<br/>one note is displaced by a comma. Again, see the archives for extensive<br/>discussions on these issues.</p></div><h3>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/13/1999 6:49:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Brett Barbaro&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:barbaro@noiselabs.com">barbaro@noiselabs.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;The problem arises in just one key, as in the I-IV-ii-V-I and I-vi-ii-V-I<br/>&gt;progressions (observe all common tones and for added fun, try adding a 6th<br/>&gt;to the IV chord and/or a 7th to the ii chord).</p><p>Thanks Brett, I understand the problem now.  IMO the correct frequencies<br/>are as follows (I will use 240 as the tonic for ease of calculation):<br/>240-300-360, 320-400-480, 266.7-320-400, 360-450-540, 240-300-360<br/>which of course has no wandering.  However the problem is obviously that<br/>one is inclined to double the 266.7 to get 533.3 rather than 540.<br/>IMO that is a mistake because even though that is the only common note<br/>between the two chords, the other two are quite clearly much better<br/>aligned with the earlier notes in the way that I did it and so they<br/>should carry the weight of argument.</p><p>Of course the question remains whether an automatic system can achieve<br/>this result, and I think that it can.  For the purposes of this<br/>discussion I am not sure whether the argument is about the doability of<br/>it or about the correct result.</p><p>&gt;This is, for example, what John A. deLaubenfels refers to as balancing the<br/>&gt;pain of retuning held notes against the pain of mistuned harmonies.</p><p>This is equivalent to the above case if the ii note in the third chord<br/>is held over to the fourth chord.  It makes no difference.  If the music<br/>does a curly thing like change the meaning of a note then the frequency<br/>has to change on the fly.</p><p>The best example of this is The Well-Tempered Clavichord where each<br/>arpeggio has at least two meanings and sometimes three.  In each case<br/>the first arpeggio of each repeated set echoes the note meanings of the<br/>last repeat of the set before so the whole thing is wonderously funny as<br/>a musical pun.  Of course this was designed for ET or something like it,<br/>as a sort of show piece for it in fact.  All the same, it could be<br/>played in an adaptive JI.  In that case the tuning for the last repeat<br/>of one arpeggio would match the first repeat of the next one and then<br/>the exact same notes would be played with a different tuning in order to<br/>fully demonstrate the nature of the pun by actually &quot;saying&quot; it both<br/>ways.</p><p>If the composer does things that require this then generally they have<br/>created a tension somewhere through punniness.  The tension can either<br/>be resolved by a small break at the weakest point (as I did above) or it<br/>can be evenly distributed throughout the passage for maximum disguise.<br/>If this is required, then there is another way of preventing too much<br/>tonic wandering and that is simply to keep pulling the error back by say<br/>10% per chord played.  That would be almost imperceptible and prevent<br/>the tonic getting very far from where it started.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>5/13/1999 5:08:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[as always with my posts, use a fixed-width font, such as<br/> Courier New, to view the diagrams and tables correctly]</p><p>[Ray Tomes, TD 179.1]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my scheme the method of adjusting notes is to take all the<br/>&gt; scales off of C in each direction as follows.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C has ratios 24 27 30 32 36 40 45 for the white notes and<br/>&gt; whatever seems reasonable for the black (separate issue to this<br/>&gt; one).</p><p>On a Monzo lattice:</p><p>                       27 D<br/>                        /<br/>            45 B       /<br/>             / &apos;-._   /<br/>            /      36 G<br/>           /        /<br/>        30 E       /<br/>         /  &apos;-._  /<br/>        /       24 C<br/>       /        /<br/>    40 A       /<br/>        &apos;-._  /<br/>             32 F</p><p>[Tomes]<br/>&gt; To determine the frequencies for G multiply all the above<br/>&gt; by 3/2 and the only note that actually shifts is A which shifts<br/>&gt; by 81/80 ratio which I assume is the 9/8 vs 10/9 discussion.<br/>&gt; I say that this note should shift by that ratio.</p><p>Following your math to the letter:</p><p>                          40.5 A<br/>                            /<br/>               67.5 F#     /<br/>                 / &apos;-._   /<br/>                /      54 D<br/>               /        /<br/>            45 B       /<br/>             / &apos;-._   /<br/>            /      36 G<br/>           /        /<br/>        60 E       /<br/>            &apos;-._  /<br/>                48 C</p><p>First of all, you surely don&apos;t mean to have decimal points<br/>in your *ratios* (not that it&apos;s going to affect the final<br/>result, but still...).

If you do that,<br/>you&apos;ve got to shift all the numbers of your scale, so that the<br/>16:9 Bb would become 32, and according to your theory, what&apos;s<br/>happened then is you&apos;ve &apos;modulated&apos; into &apos;F&apos;!</p><p>Or do you keep the &apos;D 27&apos;, and shift the &apos;A&apos; to 81?  Then<br/>you have to move along the 5-axis, and make either the<br/>16:15 Db or the 8:5 Ab your 32, in order to accomodate the &apos;F&apos;,<br/>so you&apos;re &apos;modulating&apos; even further into the &apos;flat&apos; keys.</p><p>I&apos;m not at all convinced that there&apos;s anything wrong with<br/>that 27:32:40 chord.</p><p>Sure, it&apos;s very dissonant, the 40:27 between &apos;A&apos; and &apos;D&apos;<br/>being very disagreeable in itself, and taken out of any<br/>real musical context.  BUT THAT&apos;S EXACTLY MY POINT.</p><p>My feeling is that if you used this tuning of this chord in<br/>&apos;C major&apos; *music*, it would only help to reinforce the virtual<br/>fundamental of &apos;C&apos;, because all the notes in the entire<br/>progression ultimately come from the &apos;C major&apos; scale.</p><p>An important thing that&apos;s often been overlooked by theorists<br/>of harmony is that music requires the temporal dimension.</p><p>Sure, if you&apos;re making an &apos;objective&apos; consideration of<br/>chords as static entities, then you&apos;ll probably want to<br/>use the smallest-integer ratios that will describe the notes.</p><p>But in real music, which unfolds over time, there are melodic<br/>considerations that play an important part in deciding what<br/>the &apos;correct&apos; ratios should be.  And I&apos;m not just talking<br/>about the &apos;melody&apos; itself - I&apos;m talking about the movement<br/>of the bass &apos;roots&apos; and the inner voices as well.</p><p>I&apos;ve frequently created JI chord progressions that looked<br/>good on paper, and I thought would sound great, and the<br/>individual chords *did* sound great.  But put them all together,<br/>and... yuk!</p><p>It was because of &apos;melodic dissonances&apos; in the notes of the<br/>inner voices.</p><p>So it&apos;s not so simple.</p><p>Those are just a few of the problems Paul Erlich was addressing.</p><p>And I promised I&apos;d look at your work before writing anymore,<br/>and I went back on that promise, so now I&apos;ll give it a look.<br/>My initial glance at it shows that you do consider prime<br/>factoring, so I&apos;m interested (that&apos;s *my* pet theory).  :)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
