Of course, I could try to explain a bit about<br/>some of the subsets, and so forth.</p><p>Also, I now find that the &quot;Wonder Tuning&quot; included by Manuel Op de<br/>Coul in the Scala archive based on (3:2)^(1/3), or ~233.985 cents,<br/>uses a generator equal to approximately 2.00474497 secors. Maybe I<br/>should mention this to George Secor.</p><p>&gt; This is good -- Dave Keenan had calculated the the generator meeting<br/>&gt; Secor&apos;s specifications would in fact be 116.72 cents, not 116.69<br/>&gt; cents -- so it&apos;s good to know that George had already made this<br/>&gt; correction.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s nice that the results agree, showing that the true value of<br/>a secor is a bit further from 7/72 octave than the initial<br/>approximation in his first article on the temperament, or maybe<br/>microtemperament.</p><p>&gt; Note that, with this definition, the Secorian temperaments can be<br/>&gt; safely said to consitute a &quot;Middle Path&quot;, and not an ET.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a &quot;middle path&quot; temperament which can be approximated by<br/>certain ET&apos;s as discussed in some of these threads, just as JI systems<br/>can be approximated by certain ET&apos;s also.</p><p>Of course, since George Secor&apos;s temperament is presented as an<br/>approximation of Partch&apos;s &quot;monophonic fabric,&quot; we might say that a<br/>similar scheme using something like 7/72 octave as a generator is an<br/>ET (or subset) approximating a &quot;middle path&quot; temperament approximating<br/>a JI system.</p><p>By the way, while a Secorian temperament isn&apos;t an eventone, maybe it<br/>represents a broader category of &quot;evenstep&quot; tunings where we have<br/>relationships analogous to &quot;four equal fifths make a major third.&quot;<br/>Here, for example, we have &quot;three near-7:8&apos;s of two secors each make a<br/>near-2:3 of six secors,&quot; or &quot;three near-5:7&apos;s of five secors each make<br/>a near-4:11 of 15 secors.&quot;</p><p>The term &quot;evenstep,&quot; by the way, came up in a dialogue where someone<br/>(or maybe more than one person) pointed out that there are tunings<br/>with these kind of relationships that don&apos;t fit a usual eventone<br/>pattern; so eventone tunings might be considered that subset of<br/>evenstep tunings where the generator is more specifically a fifth of<br/>which two form a regular whole-tone and four a regular major third.</p><p>A final point occurs to me: might the largest variation in George&apos;s<br/>temperament from just, approximately 3.323 cents (with GNU Emacs Calc,<br/>I get ~3.3228725522864030398 cents), be considered as a definition for<br/>one kind of &quot;near-just&quot; standard? As he notes, this is the variation<br/>for either the 4:5 or the 8:9.</p><p>By the way, Paul, as someone who has done such an immense amount along<br/>with Dave Keenan and Graham Breed and Joe Pehrson and others to<br/>&quot;rediscover&quot; and promote the Secorian temperaments, you&apos;re helping to<br/>build a bridge between the exciting era that produced the Scalatron<br/>and today&apos;s era of global tuning technologies and dialogue via the<br/>Internet. Now, as then, the challenge is to see if we can get the<br/>options -- acoustical or electronic -- more widely appreciated,<br/>especially in cultures where mass standardization has replaced variety<br/>and choice.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
