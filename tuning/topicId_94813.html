Particularly when you start from a decent p-limit equal temperament val, you are likely to get scales with desirable qualities such as constant structure and proper.</p><p>If the scale is of composite number size and there is an Euler genus of the right properties, the dwarf construction tends to find it. For instance, the 5-limit scales for the stardard vals for 9, 10, 12 (the Duodene), 15, 18, 21 etc, including 72. If not a genus, you often get a genus with a corner nibbled off such as 7 (Zarleno/Ptolemy diatonic), 13, 17, 19 etc including 31. Another common type is more peculiar: merged Euler genuses. This can be as small as a single note sticking out, but it can be much more dramatic (34, 46, 53, 58.)</p><p>I&apos;m concentrating on the 5-limit because Scala will draw the corresponding lattices for you.</p></div>
