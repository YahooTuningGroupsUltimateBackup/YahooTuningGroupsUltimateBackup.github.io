I must be slow, but<br/>I never had paid any significant attention to postings on golden<br/>meantone. Now, upon investigating mathematically what happens when<br/>you temper meantone to yield a perfect 1.618034 ratio (in terms of<br/>pitch size, not frequency), I see that amazing things happen (amazing<br/>to me, anyway).</p><p>First this meantone is fairly close to the Woolhouse 7/26-comma<br/>meantone. The fifths are 5.741 cents flat, major thirds, 1.456, and<br/>minor thirds 4.285 cents flat. I take the decimals out so far just to<br/>prevent rounding errors that otherwise obscure the exactness of the<br/>golden mean properties of this tuning system.</p><p>What I never before realized is that having tempered in this manner,<br/>not only the major and minor seconds are in the ratio of the golden<br/>mean, but also the diatonic and chromatic half-steps, the minor third<br/>to major second, the perfect fourth to minor third, the minor sixth<br/>to perfect fourth, and the minor ninth to minor sixth.</p><p>So here we have an admittedly open temperament (closely approximated<br/>by 81-EDO, however) that has the recursively self-referent properties<br/>of the golden mean accessible to the human ear on the level of<br/>ubiquitous golden proportions among PITCH DISTANCES. We hear pitch<br/>logarithmically and golden meantone BOTH respects that and yields<br/>highly consonant harmonic relationships in addition to the<br/>pervasiveness of the golden proportion melodically.</p><p>Further, if we substitute 81-tET, we get the Fibonacci sequence<br/>starting from chromatic semitones, then diatonic semitones, whole<br/>steps, minor thirds, perfect fourths, minor sixths and minor ninths<br/>as 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and 55 steps respectively. Also 81-tET is in the<br/>Fibonacci sequence seeded by the numbers 7 and 12 (i.e., 7, 12, 19,<br/>31, 50, 81, all of which are well-known meantone approximations<br/>excepting the 7 which can be taken as the steps of a perfect fifth<br/>from within 12-tET.</p><p>No such magical effects appear either aurally or analytically when<br/>the golden mean is applied directly to frequency, which is not how we<br/>perceive anyway. Considering the recursive, fractal nature of so many<br/>other elements of musical structure, I find all this highly<br/>intriguing.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawier@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I came up with these two scales today and both are based on the<br/>classic 1.618:1.000 ratio also known as the Golden Mean.
