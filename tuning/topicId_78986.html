It looks like NEO style, a composer with some knowledge of general<br/>Baroque idioms (4th harmonic progressions up and down, hemiola...),<br/>but imitation is not so perfect, more superficial... Or some naive<br/>amateur but very creative and original composer who even could live<br/>in 18th century, but this is rather unlikely. Like Scarlatti, but I<br/>know his works well so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s him. I don&apos;t think it could<br/>be somebody in 19th century, such fresh sounding music seems to me<br/>more contemporary, like intentional retro. But it I don&apos;t count<br/>polyphonic lithurgical music, Baroque retro started with Debussy and<br/>Ravel... Of course Reicha could do such music, but for sure he didn&apos;t<br/>do this. Also triplets against tuplets, quarter triplets against<br/>four, or four against sextuplets from the second movement don&apos;t<br/>appear in this form in Baroque. In formal aspects it differs from<br/>original music as well. Such periods and melodic motifs were not used<br/>in those times. This sound more like a work of some neoclassically<br/>oriented minimalist. Too mechanic progressions...<br/>In tuning - some kind of just temperament? Black keys are rather low<br/>which has in result</p><p>2. Noise looks like a very artificial noise, which differs a lot from<br/>natural vinyl noise, besides clicks are missing. Imitation is not<br/>perfect because frequency curve is different from old records, too<br/>much bass and highs. It sounds more just like a combination of<br/>background noise with MIDI record (rhythm are too perfect to be<br/>played in real time by human performer, except the second movement<br/>with not well synchronized tracks, probably intentionally). Record<br/>has some small distortion and reverb, which were probably added<br/>artificially from DSP, not from low quality recording machine and<br/>natural space in the room.</p><p>3. It sound like a piano combined with hammer piano. Some notes sound<br/>doubled.</p><p>And now I wonder what it is. Can be your composition :-) or some of<br/>colleague from your generation. To me it looks like he/she should<br/>study more hard about Baroque music to obtain better results in style<br/>imitation.  But this is not so bad in my opinion. Of course I can be<br/>totally wrong in everything.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 4 Nov 2008, at 5:59 PM, Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi tuners,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you&apos;ll very quickly hear what this has to do with tunings.

F. again, you were right - it&apos;s mine. :-D You see, this is how we got to know each other after I was your student for a few years. :-) - I hope you don&apos;t mind if I tell you about the interesting story that is linked to this music.</p><p>I recorded the piece at the end of March 2004, which was about three months before I finished my conservatory studies. Before it all began, I made a CD full of clean sawtooth tones tuned to something like 7/25-comma meantone (from Eb to G#) and asked one piano tuning teacher if he could retune one of the upride pianos to this for me. He was so kind that he did it and then I recorded two audio tracks with this retuned instrument on an good-old-fashioned 4-track tape recorder -- one was played normaly, the other was played twice as fast (that&apos;s exactly why it sounds like an old pianoforte). Later, I added the distortion to the sound and removed the higher frequencies. Then, on April the 1st, I decided to do a joke. I met our music history teacher and said to her that I had heard some music on the radio and that I would be interested if she knew who might be its author. When I played the first movement from the tape, she started singing along and after a while she said: &quot;Well, Petr, you know what that is? These are Dowland&apos;s variations.&quot; I was out of words. :-D But I said that there was a slow movement as well and so she asked me to keep it playing. When she heard the slow part, whe said with a very surprised voice: &quot;It&apos;s strange, now it&apos;s suddenly sounding like something from Germany! But I doubt that a German would have written variations on Dowland.&quot; When the last movement ended, she just said: &quot;Well, I&apos;m not sure who it was. But I think it must have been someone of the French clavecinists living even before Couperin; you know, there is just very little ornamentation there&quot; I thanked her, smiled, and didn&apos;t let her know the truth until the end of April. When I finally told her that it was mine, she said: &quot;Nice, I&apos;m curious when you&apos;ll come to me with another Baroque-like piece -- but you won&apos;t fool me next time, right?&quot; -- But anyway, later, when some of my school mates heard about the story, many said to me: &quot;Before you, noone has ever made such a constructive April joke at this school.&quot;</p><p>Okay, that&apos;s it ... Now back to scales again. :-D</p><p>Petr</p><p>PS: D. F., I&apos;m listening to your variations on the Czech anthem -- I&apos;ll write offlist later.</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2008 1:05:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello to all of you, and thanks especially to D.
