A generalized keyboard is one where intervals are<br/>&gt; &gt; covered by the same key distance, no matter what the absolute<br/>pitch is.</p><p>As Carl Lumma stated, Bosanquet, coined the term &quot;generalized<br/>keyboard&quot; for a keyboard that is able to accommodate tunings defined<br/>by a &quot;generating&quot; interval (note the same word root), in this<br/>particular case a fifth (either just or tempered).</p><p>&gt; Does this mean that only Equal tempered scale work on Generalized<br/>Keyboards?</p><p>No.  The only requirement is that the tones of the scale or tonal<br/>system all be members of a single series in which consecutive members<br/>differ in pitch by the generating interval.  So on Bosanquet&apos;s<br/>keyboard you could use a temperament consisting of a series of fifths<br/>of practically any size, even if two tones at opposite directions in<br/>the series never matched (with octave reduction) to make a closed<br/>circle.</p><p>However, this doesn&apos;t mean that a generalized keyboard won&apos;t work for<br/>a system having mixed sizes of fifths (i.e., an unequal temperament)<br/>or even just intonation.  If you can find a logical way to map a set<br/>of tones into some division of the octave (provided that the keyboard<br/>will work for that division), then you could assign those tones to<br/>the keyboard as if they were members of that division.</p><p>&gt; Is there a Generalized Keyboard for 19 tone, and one for 31 tone,<br/>etc...?</p><p>No.  The whole point of a generalized keyboard is to be able to use<br/>it for many different systems (as well as the uniform fingering<br/>patterns).  For example, Bosanquet&apos;s keyboard will handle 12, 17, 19,<br/>22, 26, 27, 29, 31, 41, 46, and 53, just to name a bunch.  It won&apos;t<br/>handle 24, because its fifths are in two separate circles.</p><p>However, on my Scalatron I do have 24-ET as two sets of 12 -- the<br/>standard 12-ET on the white, black, and red keys, and the<br/>quartertones on the blue and green keys, so I can play quartertones<br/>if I read them as if they were 31-ET.  But this is at best a<br/>makeshift arrangement.  A different generalized setup (using ~9:11 as<br/>a generating interval) would be able to handle 24 very nicely, as<br/>well as some others such as 17, 31, and 41.  But some very good<br/>divisions such as 22 and 46 would be excluded.  (Of course you would<br/>have 12 as a subset of 24.)</p><p>&gt; If you are refering to my posts on this, might you offer a<br/>&gt; recommendation of a keyboard layout for the 43 tone scale of Partch?</p><p>Graham Breed referred to a keyboard mapping that I proposed in<br/>Xenharmonikon 3.  I don&apos;t think the link was right; try this one:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/secor.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/secor.PDF</a></p><p>Here&apos;s the latest version of that (in a zipped file), complete with<br/>key dimensions and colors.  The order of the rows is now reversed and<br/>then slanted to lateralize the octaves:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.zip">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.zip</a></p><p>Details are in my posting #37151.  I was illustrating how 19-limit<br/>ratios can be mapped onto 72, so some of these are different from<br/>those in Partch&apos;s 43-tone set.  You would need to look at Partch&apos;s<br/>ratios in the Xenharmonikon article diagram to identify their<br/>locations on this latest graphic.</p><p>This &quot;decimal keyboard&quot; will nicely accommodate a couple of the<br/>larger divisions, 41 and 72, in addition to 31.  It can also be used<br/>for 53 (with a 5-degree generator; I don&apos;t think anybody has ever<br/>suggested this before, so this might be news to a more than a few<br/>people), but many of the intervals will occur in places different<br/>from 31, 41, and 72.  So fingerings in 53 will be different from the<br/>others, just as 22 is different from 19 and 31 on the Bosanquet<br/>keyboard.</p><p>I imagine that this is more information than you ever wanted or<br/>needed, but once I get going it&apos;s sometimes hard to stop!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39495 href="#39495">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2002 11:24:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, October 11, 2002 11:14 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Generalized?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Michael J McGonagle &lt;fndsnd@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there a Generalized Keyboard for 19 tone,<br/>&gt; &gt; and one for 31 tone, etc...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No.  The whole point of a generalized keyboard is to be able to use<br/>&gt; it for many different systems (as well as the uniform fingering<br/>&gt; patterns).

First, here&apos;s the same diagram labeled for 31-ET, which will<br/>work just fine for this explanation:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KbScal31.zip</p><p>This differs from Bosanquet&apos;s original &quot;generalised keyboard&quot; of 1875<br/>only in the size and shape of the keys (and in the Americanized, or<br/>Americanised, spelling of the name, if you want to get picky).  The<br/>keyboard geometry is such that only tones in a single *chain* or<br/>*series* of fifths can be put onto the keyboard.  If are in 24-ET or<br/>72-ET (for example) and you start on C and play tones along the<br/>series of fifths in the sharp direction, i.e., C G D A E B F# and<br/>then do the same thing in the flat direction, i.e., C F Bb Eb Ab Db<br/>Gb, you will find that the F# and Gb are the same pitch -- a circle<br/>of 12-ET, so the ends of the chain are now joined into a *bicycle<br/>chain*.  Observe that the vertical position of each key in the series<br/>is slightly higher (in the sharp direction) or lower (in the flat<br/>direction) as you go through the series of fifths.</p><p>Continuing the series in either direction will only repeat pitches<br/>you already have.  This is fine if you want duplicate keys for<br/>alternate fingerings for 12-ET, but you&apos;ll never get any of the other<br/>pitches of 24-ET or 72-ET by going through a series of fifths,<br/>because you have no way of jumping out of the &quot;bicycle chain&quot; of<br/>fifths into another one unless you introduce some other interval (one<br/>not found in 12-ET) into the series.  And if you do that, then you no<br/>longer have a &quot;generalized&quot; arrangement of tones.</p><p>So there&apos;s no such thing as a &quot;universal generalized keyboard&quot; that<br/>will handle everything, but I believe that the Bosanquet geometry<br/>comes closest to that ideal.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39594 href="#39594">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2002 8:52:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39468.html#39577">/tuning/topicId_39468.html#39577</a></p><p>&gt; Continuing the series in either direction will only repeat pitches<br/>&gt; you already have.
