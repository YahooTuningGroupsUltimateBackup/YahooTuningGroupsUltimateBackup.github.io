This way, the octave becomes<br/>our natural period, and when pitches are viewed as on a circle, we are<br/>seeing a literal analog to the way leaves on many plants grow to maximize<br/>their exposure to sunlight...via the Fibonacci sequence. IOW, many plant<br/>leaves grow at angles which relate to each other by 2*3.1415/phi radians,<br/>maximizing their potential NOT to be blocked by higher layers as the plant<br/>grows. It&apos;s called the &apos;golden angle&apos; relationship.</p><p><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/27890/applications5.html">http://library.thinkquest.org/27890/applications5.html</a></p><p>One can derive scales from &apos;Fibonacci EDOs&apos; : 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55...<br/>I like 34. Interestingly, MOS scales occur when the subset is also a<br/>fibonacci number.</p><p>My current favorite is &apos;8of34 MOS&apos;:<br/>5 5 3 5 5 3 5 3 or L L s L L s L s</p><p>You can of course play around with the various rotations (modes) and get<br/>different moods and effects.</p><p>Having 8 notes in the scale is nice: more possibilities than 5, but less<br/>tension and information than 13 and up....it seems to be a sweet spot, just<br/>slightly more information than a typical diatonic scale.

Although MOS theory is new,&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;thanks<br/>to Wilson, it can be shown that most historically used&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot; scales are MOS<br/>scales.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, but Moment of Symmetry involves symmetry to the octave, not the PHI-tave...which pretty much sums up the issue I have with it.&nbsp; And, of course, MOS scales work well...but PHI is a different animal and, IMVHO, it at least begs the challenge &quot;is achieving symmetry at the octave really the best way to push consonance out of scales based on PHI?&quot;.&nbsp; And, in my tests (believe me, I&apos;ve done hundreds in the 4-5 months I&apos;ve been somewhat obsessed with fractal-number-generate scales)...the octave does not work so well as the PHI-tave for PHI.&nbsp; However, as a side note and nod to JI and the use of &quot;odd limits&quot;, I did notice that rounding 1.618 to 1.61 so the ear thinks it is 1.6 IE 8/5 does an some additional consonance while mostly preserving the symmetry: so that makes a very good &quot;compromise&quot; version of the period.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What&apos;s up with the way you&apos;ve wrapped the lines with returns in&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot; your response? Sure is hard to read!&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, what the hell... CARL ARE YOU READING THIS?!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically Carl and I had a long debate about how supposedly bad my quoting habits are and he pretty much demanded IE both use quote marks for every line I quote and use carriage returns for every line..or face having many of my messages removed from discussion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m sorry Carl but, from here on in (IE starting after this message), I&apos;m quoting without your carriage return advice.&nbsp; I can&apos;t satisfy everyone and, for those who think I&apos;m &quot;not listening&quot; simply because I can&apos;t take 2+ people&apos;s conflicting advice on how I quote, well, tough...I can&apos;t part the Red Sea and take two conflicting pieces of advice.&nbsp; And in this case, Aaron, I agree with your advice.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=83274 href="#83274">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>4/28/2009 2:41:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron&gt; &quot;phi_7be.scl: 36-tET approximation of phi_7b&quot;<br/>...Sounds like it might be Rick&apos;s scale, which is also based on 36-TET, or something a good deal like it...I&apos;ll defintely have to check on that one.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sure there&apos;s lots for you to discover and learn from your predecessors!
