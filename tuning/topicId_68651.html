Likewise, 9/7 is<br/>&gt;a 9-limit (rather than a 7-limit) consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This relationship between consonance and harmonic limit, first<br/>&gt;proposed by Harry Partch, is backward-compatible with common-practice<br/>&gt;(5-limit) usage and is widely accepted in this group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--George</p><p>I understand that the fact that in all the ratios (n/d) we normally consider<br/>n and d are coprimes can generate some confusion with primes (especially because 80% of odds in the first 20 harmonics are primes).</p><p>Anyway the odd limit is defined on the basis of a prime number which is 2. I think this comes from octave equivalence but it also gives another kind of equivalence which is that of intervals inversions: 4/3 and 3/2, 16/15 and 15/8 have the same odd limit. Why is this done only for number 2? Why we don&apos;t consider also that 6/5 is the inversion of 9/5 respect 3/2?</p><p>If we say that odd limit has to be joined with other parameters as n*d or n+d to have a good ranking for consonance we have to consider that for odd/even ratios the consonance is in inverse relation to n*d or n+d while for even/odd ratios is the opposite: try comparing 12/7 with 8/7, 12/5 with 8/5, 16/9 with 14/9 and this with 10/9.</p><p>In any case is really hard to my ears to accept that 8/7 sounds smoother than 9/4 or 16/9. This could be because prime limit works better or maybe because each odd limit has a threshold of n*d where it begins to be worst than the successive limit.</p><p>A reason why primes could be important in ranking consonance is maybe related to perception. If a ratio should be dismantled in *phisical* units, using primes we would spare room. I don&apos;t know if there is some relation between primes and perception (any papers?) but I suspect that, if intellectually we can compress data in this way, also our brain could work in the same manner.</p><p>I try to represent this (O = unit on the origin, U=other units):</p><p>x-axis: addition</p><p>_OUU_ this is 3 or 3^1 or 1+1+1.</p><p>y-axis: exponents</p><p>_UUU_<br/>_O____ this is 9 or 3^2 or (1+1+1)^2</p><p>As you can see 4 units are enough to compress the number 9.</p><p>9/8 could be builded of 8 units:</p><p>_UUU_<br/>_O____<br/>_U____<br/>_U____<br/>_UU___</p><p>z-axis: multiplication (primes)</p><p>15 should be represented in this way:</p><p>_OUU__ (for z=0)</p><p>_UUUUU_ (for z=1)</p><p>The volume of each ratio in this tridimensional space gives the quantity of information necessary to store it.<br/>This is the ranking for the most common ratios:</p><p>3/2 (5)<br/>4/3 (6)<br/>9/8 (8)<br/>5/4 (8)<br/>5/3 (8)<br/>16/9 (9)<br/>9/5 (9)<br/>7/4 (10)<br/>6/5 (11)<br/>10/9 (11)<br/>7/5 (12)<br/>15/8 (12)<br/>16/15 (13)</p><p>If I would be a brain I would store ratios in this way....</p><p>lorenzo</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2007 2:53:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Lorenzo,</p><p>&gt; Anyway the odd limit is defined on the basis of a prime number<br/>&gt; which is 2.

If<br/>you have a harmonic interval larger than an octave, you can make it<br/>smaller by octaves until it&apos;s within an octave.  Then you apply the<br/>harmonic rules to it.

So for a C-F fourth you aren&apos;t allowed to<br/>lower the F another octave and make it an F-C fifth.  An<br/>octave-equivalent group of intervals can distinguish directions but<br/>not inversions as such.  Another way of looking at it is you can<br/>enforce an octave equivalence of intervals but not of pitches.</p><p>                                     Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/2/2007 11:27:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hiya Graham - good to hear from you.</p><p>&gt; You can have octave equivalence without inversional equivalence.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s how harmony was explained in the counterpoint books I read.

Until you get above the range of the piano (where notes start sounding flatter than they actually are before they lose all sense of pitch entirely), an F in one octave sounds pretty much like the F in the next higher or lower octave, with a difference that&apos;s only a little bit more than a difference in timbre.</p><p>When you get two notes together, of course, it&apos;s easier to notice the difference between a fifth and a fourth, or a third and a sixth, but there&apos;s still something very similar in the &quot;flavor&quot; of fourths and fifths, or a third compared with its inversion. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d call it &quot;equivalence&quot;, but the octave is pretty much unique in that respect. You can take the highest note in a 3-note chord and transpose it down an octave without much change in the sound of the chord. I don&apos;t hear this kind of similarity in tunings that repeat at the 3:1 or any other interval.</p><p>But once you get more than two or three notes in a chord, the spacing makes a difference. You might end up with lots of discordant intervals (like minor seconds) if you transpose all the notes into a single octave, while if they&apos;re spaced widely enough apart, the chord as a whole is more consonant. So there&apos;s a limit to this whole &quot;octave equivalence&quot; idea, but it&apos;s more than just an arbitrary mathematical idea.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2007 11:31:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;Incidentally, Paul Erlich showed that if you start with n*d<br/>&gt; &gt;and add only octave equivalence, you get odd limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand this.

Ranking all these ratios there should be a constant<br/>&gt;increasing<br/>&gt; of dissonance for example with 19/1 19/2 19/3 19/4 ... 19/18.<br/>&gt; This does&apos;nt happen with any timbre I&apos;ve tried. For each timbre<br/>&gt;there is a<br/>&gt; sort of ondulation in ranking smoothness.</p><p>I agree completely and this is the point of the Csound interval<br/>testing code I posted here- in that example there is, to my ears,<br/>and undulation of consonance and a strong example of a dip, or jump,<br/>in consonance in the intervals as they move away from 3/2.</p><p>&gt;And for each timbre this<br/>&gt; ondulation is different (for some timbre 19/11 sounds better than<br/>&gt;19/10, for<br/>&gt; others 19/10 is better than 19/9, ...). Do exists any timbre which<br/>&gt;perfectly<br/>&gt; agree with odd limit in this context?

Helmholtz, Partch, etc.), the &quot;special&quot; similitude<br/>&gt; &gt; exhibited by the &quot;octave&quot; is simply the affect of<br/>&gt; &gt; prime-factor 2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In what way did Partch or Helmholtz say... what exactly?</p><p>I did a search on google in Helmholtz&apos;s &quot;sensation of tone&quot;: prime numbers are not named (just a footnote of Ellis about Eulero&apos;s theory).</p><p>I transcribe from Partch&apos;s book &quot;genesis of a music&quot; (page 114):</p><p>&quot;The question as to whether the ear prefers a ratio composed of multiples of small prime numbers to a ratio of approximately the same width which involves smaller numbers but a larger prime number is one that cannot be answered categorically; each instance is a different problem. The fairly dose intervals 9/8 (203.9 cents) and 8/7 (231.2 cents) are an example. Considered only as melodic relationships to 1/1, the ear might generally prefer 9/8, in which both numbers are multiples of 3 or less, to 8/7, a ratio with smaller numbers but involving a prime number higher than 3. There are, however, many instances in which a composer will prefer 8/7 for melodic or tonality considerations; the ear by no means always prefers the multiple-number ratio (see below).&quot;</p><p>[...]</p><p>&quot;To put it in another way, each of these multiple-number ratios is the result of two ratios within the 5 limit:<br/>8/5 X 4/3 = 32/15, which, reduced within a 2/1, is 16/15;<br/>5/3 X 4/3 = 20/9, which, reduced, is 10/9;<br/>3/2 X 3/2 = 9/4, reduced, 9/8;<br/>4/3 X 4/3 = 16/9;<br/>3/2 X 6/5 = 18/10, in reduced terms, 9/5;<br/>and 3/2 X 5/4 = 15/8.&quot;</p><p>[...]</p><p>&quot;In the Pythagorean ratio 81/64 both numbers are multiples of 3 or under, yet because of their excessive largeness the ear certainly prefers 5/4 for this approximate degree, even though it involves a prime number higher than 3.</p><p>In the case of the 45/32 &quot;tritone&quot; our theorists have gone around their elbows to reach their thumbs, which could have been reached simply and directly and non-&quot;diabolically&quot; via the number 7. However, since 7 is outside the province of this phase of the discussion, the lacuna 4/3-3/2 will be abeyed, temporarily.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that this is written in the chapter &quot;analysis of 5-limit&quot;. It seems to me that Partch&apos;s thought was more prime-limit directed. The 5 limit includes 15/8, 9/8, 10/9, 16/9, 9/5: it seems a 5-prime limit. Maybe I&apos;m wrong but I think there is nothing in this book about a 9-limit.</p><p>For this reason I think Partch was contradicting himself in defining odd-limit ratios families in chapter three:<br/>since Partch&apos;s limit goes from 3 to 11, the 9-ratios was the only possibility we have to understand his opinion about it. And it seems to me that in this book prime limit concept prevails in a quite explicit way. Read this (page 150):</p><p>&quot;Enigma of the Multiple-Number Ratio</p><p>One perplexing problem remains to be touched upon, namely the strength of a multiple-number ratio as compared with a ratio of approximately the same width involving prime numbers or a prime number, the foremost example of which is 9/8 as compared with 8/7. Just why the ear hears 9/8 with speedier conviction than it hears 8/7, either consecutively or simultaneously sounded, can only be conjectured at present. To be sure, 9/8 is the difference between two of the strongest consonances, 3/2 and 4/3, but further, the wave period, from maximum to maximum, has an added regularity in 9/8 - three 3&apos;s of the 9 and four 2&apos;s of  the 8-a frequency of period in air-particle displacement much greater in each of the tones of 9/8. The explanation that suggests itself is that some of this strength is carried over into the simultaneous sounding. With 8/7, it is a  clear case of eight waves against seven waves; because of the involvement of the prime number 7, there is no added regularity.&quot;</p><p>*****</p><p>So here is my personal synthesis about odd and prime limit:</p><p>Odd-limit</p><p>1) it considers only octave similitude instead of other similitudes<br/>2) it fails even with low odd numbers in describing concordance: 8/7 is less concordant than 16/9 (see Partch above)<br/>3) it fails in defining &quot;affects&quot; of ratios: to me 16/9 has a clear &quot;square&quot; flavour as 3/2.<br/>4) as a measure of concordance n*d has to be considered in a different way for odd/even-odd (9/4 - 9/7) or even/odd (16/9 - 10/9)</p><p>a) it is not a dense set so it is easier to  handle</p><p>Prime-limit</p><p>1) it&apos;s a dense set so it&apos;s not easy to handle.<br/>2) it&apos;s not clear when p*q is unsustainable and it is necessary to go to the next prime</p><p>a) it considers any kind of similitude, not only octaves<br/>b) concordance is well defined within each limit by primes exponents (or n*d)<br/>c) it well defines ratios &quot;affects&quot;</p><p>Both</p><p>1) both limits are subjected to harmonic entropy: 32/27, 13/11, 19/16 are perceived as a rough 6/5</p><p>Just to let you know...I&apos;m a prime-limit fan!</p><p>lorenzo</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2007 5:24:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t read more than a few words of Partch, but when his<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments are strummed slowly, it sure sounds like a concrete<br/>&gt; &gt; demonstration of that very statement to me.

Clearly here he sees these<br/>&gt; &gt;ratios as extensions of the 11-odd-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In which way 160/81 is an extension of  11-odd limit?</p><p>Lorenzo, if Partch had meant 11-prime-limit, why would he<br/>say &apos;11-limit plus some other multiple-number ratios&apos;?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;He&apos;s speculating that there&apos;s factoring going on, but reaches<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;no conclusions. On pg 155 he shows the &quot;One Footed Bride&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;with 8/7 and 7/4 being stronger consonances than 9/8 and 16/9.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; On what is based the measure of the length of each ratio?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The graph of the sum of sine waves with frequencies lying in<br/>&gt; &gt;the various proportions<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand. Can you do an example?</p><p>See the photographs in Partch&apos;s book near pg. 155.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Partch says 8/7 is less concordant than 9/8 above. He doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;mention 16/9.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I was wrong. Anyway he would agree with me that odd limit is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; not a measure of concordance.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;You seem pretty sure you know the mind of Partch...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not a medium :-) I have just read this (page 114):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The fairly dose intervals 9/8 (203.9 cents) and 8/7<br/>&gt; (231.2 cents) are an example. Considered only as melodic<br/>&gt; relationships to 1/1, the ear might<br/>&gt; generally prefer 9/8...&quot;</p><p>You said &quot;concordance&quot;, but Partch is talking about melodic<br/>intervals here.  And further, Partch does not state that odd<br/>limit is not a measure of something.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I encourage you to come up with a rigorous exposition of your<br/>&gt; &gt;ideas, including the ranking of intervals it predicts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the moment I really can&apos;t. Infact n*d, in odd or prime limit,<br/>&gt; has no significance in itself because it works only with small<br/>&gt; numbers. 307/306 is an odd and prime limit. The density of<br/>&gt; partials (which considering time is the vertical density of<br/>&gt; sound) and the neural firing (horizontal density), which can<br/>&gt; be both measured by n*d, is high. But it sounds quite good. Why?<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t answer. Without this answer it will not be possible to<br/>&gt; use n*d as a concordance measure. Do you have some ideas?</p><p>It&apos;s my belief that n*d ranks ratios between 1/1 and 4/1<br/>by increasing discordance better than any other simple<br/>method, when the product n*d &lt; 60.  But I&apos;m willing to<br/>change that belief in light of evidence to the contrary.</p><p>To evaluate ratios with n*d &gt; 60, I use harmonic entropy, and<br/>I think it&apos;s the simplest method that ranks intervals regardless<br/>of the size of numbers in the ratios.  Again, I&apos;m willing<br/>to change that belief.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2007 7:36:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I sent this yesterday but Yahoo bounced it.

The<br/>&gt; two intervals in this example are a tiny bit less than 2 cents<br/>&gt; apart, but sound different. ...</p><p>I understand this point, but if you can discriminate between<br/>intervals less than 2 cents apart, your tolerance for error in tuning<br/>is clearly less than 2 cents.  Should I define what I mean by<br/>tolerance?  (It doesn&apos;t invalidate near intervals having different<br/>characters.)</p><p>Definition 1: _A listener&apos;s tolerance for error in tuning a<br/>particular interval_ is the largest amount that interval can be<br/>changed by, yet still seem to that listener to be the same interval.</p><p>Definition 2: _A listener&apos;s tolerance for error in tuning_ is the<br/>smallest value of that listener&apos;s tolerance for error in tuning an<br/>interval, taken over all intervals that listener can hear.</p><p>Assumption: All intervals are played in a standard natural tuned<br/>acoustic timbre with which the listener is familiar.</p><p>&gt; ... For all I know, there&apos;s an interval 10<br/>&gt; cents away that shares the same character as the second interval<br/>&gt; here, for example. And character is shared amongst completely<br/>&gt; different intervals- you can have a fifth with a somehow &quot;thirds&quot;<br/>&gt; character, for example.</p><p>Yep, I&apos;m content that that (&quot;character&quot;) describes something that<br/>some listeners hear.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then, within the range of each of these intervals plus or minus<br/>your tolerance, do you find simpler ratios that you might be<br/>assimilating them to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I assimilate to character families.</p><p>I guess I should have written:<br/>&quot;Within the range of each of these intervals plus or minus that<br/>listener&apos;s tolerance for error, are there objectively simpler<br/>ratios?

Tell me, does<br/>the &quot;fifthness&quot; of intervals very near to 3/2 not tend to swamp any<br/>other character they may express?  For example, when you hear a 73/49<br/>or a 74/49, does it sound like a fifth, or does it sound distinctly<br/>septimal?  You know, I think it might be a valuable experiment for<br/>you to generate a large random set of JI intervals in, say, the 99-<br/>odd-limit; then listen to them presented randomly (not more than<br/>about 20 at a sitting, to avoid fatigue effects) and assign each to<br/>one of a predefined list of characters, eg,<br/> unison-like,<br/> octave-like,<br/> fifth-like,<br/> fourth-like,<br/> major-third-like,<br/> minor-sixth-like,<br/> minor-third-like,<br/> major-sixth-like,<br/> ...<br/> major-semitone-like,<br/> minor-semitone-like,<br/> ...<br/> Pyth.-comma-like,<br/> ...<br/> NONE.</p><p>(Your list of characters might be quite different; this is just a<br/>suggested starting point.)</p><p>Then analyse the results to see whether the experiment supports your<br/>feeling that you are hearing these kinds of character; in particular,<br/>which characters you strongly (95% of the time or better) associate<br/>to ratios involving a particular prime in the numerator; and<br/>separately, which you strongly associate to ratios involving a<br/>particular prime in the denominator.</p><p>There&apos;d be no point me doing such an experiment, I think, because I&apos;m<br/>not at all sure I hear such character families.

For a<br/>specific boundry line we might use the mediant.</p><p>Indeed, we might, but why should we?  Will doing so bring us closer<br/>to understanding what actually happens in human perception of<br/>consonance?  Or is this only a heuristic approach that paints us a<br/>broad-brush picture, emphasising only that &quot;smaller-numbered ratios<br/>have more &apos;pull&apos;&quot;?  As a starting point, I suppose it&apos;s OK, but it<br/>doesn&apos;t really seem to advance our understanding greatly beyond<br/>scholastic theories that classify all intervals simply into<br/>consonances and dissonances.</p><p>Using the mediant (of two intervals) to define the boundary between<br/>their respective ranges of &quot;pull&quot; is an interesting notion.  How<br/>might this work?  For example:<br/> between 4/3 and 3/2, the mediant is (4+3)/(3+2) = 7/5;<br/> between 4/3 and 7/5, the mediant is (4+7)/(3+5) = 11/8;<br/> between 4/3 and 11/8, the mediant is 15/11;<br/> between 4/3 and 15/11, the mediant is 19/14;<br/> between 11/8 and 15/11, the mediant is 26/19;<br/> between 7/5 and 19/14, the mediant is 26/19;<br/> between 11/8 and 19/14, the mediant is 15/11;<br/> between 7/5 and 15/11, the mediant is 11/8;<br/>and so on.  We see that the mediant of any two of these terms is very<br/>often (but not always) identical with another mediant we calculated<br/>earlier;  For example, the mediants of 11/8 with 9/7, 5/4 and 1/1 are<br/>all equal to 4/3; however, the mediant of 11/8 with (the mediant of<br/>5/4 and 1/1) is the mediant of 11/8 with 6/5, which is 17/13, not 4/3.</p><p>Inserting successive mediants between a note and its octave, we get:<br/>a) 1/1---------------------------------------------------------2/1<br/>b) 1/1-------------------------------------3/2-----------------2/1<br/>c) 1/1-----------------4/3-----------------3/2-------5/3-------2/1<br/>d) 1/1-------5/4-------4/3-------7/5-------3/2--8/5--5/3--7/4--2/1<br/>e) 1/1--6/5--5/4--9/7--4/3-11/8--7/5-10/7--3/2- etc.</p><p>The maximum numerator N = max(n) and denominator D = max(d) in each<br/>row both follow the Fibonnaci sequence: (1) 2 3 5 8 13 21 ..., as<br/>does the maximum difference X = max(n-d).</p><p>To first approximation (case b), the intervals 1/1 and 2/1 have bands<br/>that meet at 3/2; if correct, this means that any interval less than<br/>a perfect fifth is &quot;pulled&quot; more strongly downwards - toward the<br/>unison, rather than up toward the octave; whilst any interval greater<br/>than a perfect fifth is &quot;pulled&quot; more strongly upwards - toward the<br/>octave, rather than down toward the unison.</p><p>Similarly for each succeeding case.  When we interpolate the fifth<br/>3/2, it has a band which steals a portion from each of the two<br/>previous bands - the lower part, from 4/3 to 3/2, from the unison<br/>band; and the upper part, from 3/2 to 5/3, from the octave band.  Any<br/>interval that falls within the 3/2 band will be &quot;pulled&quot; more<br/>strongly toward it than to either the unison or octave.</p><p>The insertion of the new interval, 3/2, into the previous set of<br/>intervals {1/1, 2/1} *changes* their bands of attraction, reducing<br/>them both to end at the new mediants 4/3 and 5/3.  There is thus a<br/>natural sequence of scales S1, S2, S3, ... Sn, ... formed by the<br/>operation of taking mediants, each such scale being embedded in its<br/>extension by its own mediants.  The first four and a half such scales<br/>are shown above at a) to e).</p><p>These considerations show us that the width of the band of attraction<br/>of any interval is not fixed, but varies depending on what other<br/>intervals we include in the analysis.  Only in the context of a fixed<br/>scale of just notes can we regard the attraction band&apos;s width as<br/>effectively fixed.</p><p>(Also, a band of attraction is not necessarily a band of tuning error<br/>tolerance, which is what I started talking about earlier in<br/>the &quot;exponent-limit and prime-affect&quot; thread.)</p><p>For the sake of argument, let us say that a just note is _stronger<br/>[weaker]_ than another if its interval ratio is, in some computable<br/>sense, simpler [more complex] than that of the other.  We might use<br/>denominator, or n*d, or any of several other possible measures of<br/>simplicity of ratios.  (Aside: May I just note here that the n*d<br/>measure handicaps higher intervals somewhat compared with lower<br/>ones.  Eg, 4/3 would be judged simpler than 5/3 on this measure, even<br/>though both arrived in the same scale S3.  Or is numerator more<br/>important than denominator?  If we feel that thirds and sixths are<br/>about equally complex, is that a judgment that 5/4 and 5/3 are both<br/>simpler than 7/5, and both less simple than 4/3?)</p><p>Also for the sake of argument, let us suppose that in every tempered<br/>scale, each note is a tempered approximation to a just note, which is<br/>a just interval above the unison; and just which just note that is,<br/>is quite clear from the musical context.  (The most telling clue<br/>would be the density of notes in the octave, or equivalently, the<br/>average step size.)  On this basis - which probably holds true for a<br/>lot of music, though not all - for each note n in the scale, we could<br/>write just(n) for the corresponding just ratio.</p><p>We could then say, in any tempered scale, that one note n is<br/>_stronger [weaker]_ than another note m if just(n) is _stronger<br/>[weaker]_ than just(m).</p><p>Note that I wrote &quot;if correct&quot; above.  Do the bands of attraction of<br/>a pair of just intervals always meet in their mediant?  On the face<br/>of it, this does seem plausible.  Surely we should be able to find<br/>statistical evidence for or against this idea in a large corpus of<br/>music, given some reasonable assumptions as to the nature of that<br/>music?  For example, the kind of thing played on your local &quot;easy<br/>listening&quot; radio station would, we might guess, not fight too<br/>greatly, on average, against the &quot;pull&quot; of the intervals of the scale<br/>used.</p><p>Specifically, one would predict that:<br/>(1) the number of weak notes that move _to_ a stronger note is<br/>greater than the number of weak notes that move _to_ a weaker note<br/>(other than itself (*));<br/>(2) the number of weak notes that move _toward_ a stronger note is<br/>greater than the number of weak notes that move _toward_ a weaker<br/>note (other than itself (*));<br/>(3) If a weak note n lies below [above] its corresponding just ratio;<br/>that is, if n &lt; just(n); and if just(n) is the mediant of the just<br/>notes for two other stronger notes p and q in the scale, with p lower<br/>than q; that is, if just(n) = mediant(just(p),just(q)) where p and q<br/>are scale notes stronger than n, with p &lt; q; then the number of<br/>occurrences of n that move toward p will be greater [less] than the<br/>number that move toward q.</p><p>In terms of the &quot;dynamical model&quot; approach, of interpreting<br/>consonance as a sort of gravitational attraction, or &quot;pull&quot;, and even<br/>possibly of &quot;repulsion&quot;, I must say that the predictions of this<br/>sketch do not include any of the effects of _momentum_.  Thus it is a<br/>static, rather than a dynamic model.  We observe all kinds of<br/>analogues to momentum in music, from the simple run, ascending or<br/>descending; to motivic repetition and sequence; to cadential motion<br/>resolving discords into concords; to completely non-tonal phenomena<br/>such as metre and rhythm.</p><p>(*) There may also be a &quot;local tonic&quot; or &quot;tonic shift&quot; effect, where<br/>even a weak note may simply be repeated more often than it moves to a<br/>stronger note.  This might also be treated as a &quot;momentum&quot; effect.</p><p>However, with the above cautions, we should still find something like<br/>the tendencies noted in points (1) to (3) above - at least in<br/>the &quot;easy listening&quot;, &quot;light classic&quot; and &quot;elevator music&quot; categories.</p><p>If there really is a &quot;mediant effect&quot; in the perception of consonance<br/>or at work in music, it would be interesting to speculate why this<br/>might be so.  Is there perhaps something in the mammalian, or more<br/>specifically, human perceptual system that generates mediants as<br/>artefacts of perception?</p><p>Still, until we can actually demonstrate a &quot;mediant effect&quot;, it would<br/>be premature to try to explain it ...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3>yahya_melb &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2007 9:23:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This might go some way to answering the question you asked:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How big can the numbers be?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer I&apos;m proposing is &quot;no bigger than your *personal*<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; error tolerance in tuning allows&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Harmonic entropy actually has a parameter similar to tolerance,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; called &quot;s&quot;. ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, I noticed that, and you may recall, asked how to determine a<br/>&gt; &gt; partcular listener&apos;s value of s - without any really satisfactory<br/>&gt; &gt; answer that I remember.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t remember that, but basically s is the only free variable<br/>&gt; in the model.

I reckon much the same happens for me, if not as<br/>widely (probably from half a cent to around 6 cents); but I&apos;m at a<br/>loss to explain that &quot;character&quot;, except as something timbral.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then, within the range of each of these intervals plus or minus<br/>your tolerance, do you find simpler ratios that you might be<br/>assimilating them to?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I can say, definitely not, at least in tuning with musical<br/>goals in mind, which is the only kind of tuning I have time to bother<br/>with.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; Assimilating to simpler intervals simply doesn&apos;t explain why I<br/>sometimes choose a very complex ratio over a far simpler ratio two<br/>cents away.</p><p>Do you know what *does* explain it?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2007 2:02:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yahya_melb&quot; &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I take your point.

I could say, dishonestly, that<br/>my tolerance is zero, and &quot;prove&quot; that with the tone matching test<br/>(different tones in both ears, then you turn a big knob to make them<br/>match), but that would be misleading (although I bet people use such<br/>results to sport their prowess). That is a highly artificial test- I<br/>highly doubt I can do this with a stringed instrument, even if I<br/>wanted to. The slow &quot;creamy&quot; sound of almost-exact sounds better<br/>when matching pitches, to me; I had to go beyond what sounded best<br/>to make the &quot;disappear&quot; effect of an exact match).</p><p>&gt; Do you know what *does* explain it?</p><p>Now that I&apos;ve been digging around a bit trying to find an<br/>explanation, it might be something like Partch&apos;s &quot;numerary nexus&quot;.<br/>Something along those lines- I&apos;m calling it character families<br/>because that&apos;s what it sounds like to me, and I want to stay away<br/>from magic numbers.</p><p>I had overlooked Gene&apos;s post to the effect that we must try with<br/>irrational numbers and of course he&apos;s right about that. However, as<br/>I&apos;ve said before, there must be a &quot;don&apos;t be silly&quot; proximity- how do<br/>I know that the irrational interval doesn&apos;t lie within .2 cents of a<br/>distinct rational interval of the right character family? This is<br/>one reason I&apos;m keen on the idea of character families, because they<br/>would reduce into what seems to me reasonable regions, not magic<br/>numbers.</p><p>Perhaps it is timbre related, as you say. The answer may lie within<br/>say the first dozen partials or so, and once the fundamentals are no<br/>longer at a simple ratio we may seek simple ratios for, say, the<br/>third or seventh partials?  That seems to fit in with one of my<br/>first posts here, where I noted that sometimes I have to open the<br/>filter on a synth sound to make it sound more consonant.</p><p>If the answer lies above the fundamental, it would be VERY timbre<br/>dependent, of course. So I must now test with different timbres- a<br/>square and a saw are the obvious starting places because if the<br/>effect simply disappears, or is obviously stronger, with the square,<br/>it&apos;s all clearly related to partials above the fundamental.</p><p>To find the time...</p><p> -Cameron Bobro</p></div>
