After April 9, I&apos;ll hunt for them and send them to<br/>&gt; you, Robert, if you want to archive them publicly.</p><p>Yes, I can use as much space as I like on the NCBI site. Only proviso<br/>is that it has to be public, I can&apos;t use it for storing private<br/>documents.</p><p>The digests would have e-mail addresses in them I expect, so wouldn&apos;t<br/>be suitable for a public site in that form.</p><p>However, I could easily do a little program of a few lines to go<br/>through them all and remove the e-mail addresses, and split them<br/>into individual numbered messages. Then the other program could<br/>read those and use them to make an archive.</p><p>Eventually, if I put it on the NBCI site, and leave it there,<br/>I should also link to it from one of the web pages on the site.</p><p>I suppose one could link to it from the FAQ tree, making it clear<br/>that it is for use of those who want to look for FAQ questions,<br/>or research for answers (including things they posted themselves)<br/>which is indeed the main reason I had originally for doing it.</p><p>Actually I&apos;m a bit unsure about whether it is okay to have the<br/>FAQ tree as it is, because of the way one gets rid of the<br/>banners by clicking on some of the links, and maybe they&apos;d<br/>want me to find another way to do it that doesn&apos;t have that<br/>effect.</p><p>I&apos;ll need to ask them about that if it stays there for any<br/>length of time.</p><p>That also answers a question Joseph asked earlier - there are<br/>no bandwidth or space restrictions on the FAQ tree, so from<br/>that point of view, could stay here indefinitely, but not<br/>so sure what I&apos;ll do about the banners at present, and may<br/>need to contact them to clarify what their policies are.</p><p>I have downloaded all the posts from the Yahoo archive, and<br/>at present am working on the final details of how to organise<br/>them all, and the indexes, for the zip, which involves some<br/>extra programming.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/2/2001 8:38:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20665">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20665</a></p><p>Hi Robert!</p><p>Actually, what REALLY should happen, in my opinion, is that the MILLS<br/>Digest and the YAHOOGROUPS Digests should be somehow COMBINED!</p><p>Essentially YAHOOGROUPS is a CONTINUATION of the Mills list!  The<br/>list had to move after Mills would no longer host it!</p><p>Maybe there would be some way to do the numbering so that the first<br/>post of YAHOOGROUPS would still be 0.  Maybe a &quot;negative&quot; numbering<br/>of the Mills posts up to &quot;0&quot; or some such (like B.C and A.D, only in<br/>this case it&apos;s, of course, &quot;before Yahoo&quot;)... I dunno...</p><p>But I think the two lists should be together and perhaps, at some<br/>point, released on CD-ROM for people to have for safekeeping, unless<br/>it is quite easy to download all of them...</p><p>Just some thoughts!

Please do not, however, forget<br/>that this subject has come up before, and that there are certain<br/>matters to take into account before anyone, willy-nilly, posts or<br/>sells these archives publically:</p><p>1. There may well be people who posted to the Mills list that never<br/>intended the posts to become part of a large public database. It was<br/>on university servers, accessed through the net, and not<br/>_necessarily_ intended as an archived body of work. Since much of the<br/>information would be considered the opinions of the individual<br/>authors, what would you do if any of those authors had an objection<br/>to the project?</p><p>2. If, for any reason(s) someone decides to go forward, the very<br/>*least* that should be done (and from what I&apos;ve seen, Robert Walker<br/>is **more** than up to the task!) the files should be scanned and<br/>email addresses should be masked (i.e. joe_p@******.*** or something<br/>similar). The last thing I want is *more* spam, thankyouverymuch.</p><p>There /must/ be a way to do this fairly and respectfully, I just know<br/>it. I guess I would just like some careful consideration put into it<br/>instead of the jumpingupanddown hyteria and elation at the thought of<br/>all that good info, ready to eat...</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2001 10:31:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>End part of the last post is really reply to yours,<br/>sorry, got a bit muddled.</p><p>Yes, I agree it makes sense to combine the two lists,<br/>and in fact one of the early posts in the archive<br/>is a digest from the Mills list echoed to<br/>Yahoo.</p><p>The Car horn organ looks fun!
