The product I&apos;m<br/>referring to is the SC-8850 but one could reasonably expect modules<br/>from 1999 on to conform. It allows one to adjust a table of 12 notes C<br/>to B each by -63, through zero, to +64 cents and to define which of<br/>the 16 MIDI channels will be affected by such retunings by setting a<br/>bit for any channel. It appears that there is just one such table<br/>within the unit.</p><p>In this it is very similar to some Yamaha XG instruments that give the<br/>same control but do it via an XG SysEx message.</p><p>JohnG.</p></div><h3><a id=75537 href="#75537">ðŸ”—</a>John Garside &#x3C;garsidejl@yahoo.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2008 1:46:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; By &quot;current&quot;, do you mean &quot;7 years since&quot;?</p><p>Yes.

Hardware samplers are more of a<br/>&gt; rarity at the high end because it is even harder to compete<br/>&gt; with personal computer hardware in this domain.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I said that samplers are conventional. No, I&apos;m not<br/>talking samplers nor how Waldorf or Access started, merely what one<br/>reads in their current product line up on their web pages. What I am<br/>referring to is the sort of instrument, usually ROM sample based like<br/>the Yamaha MU128 or the Roland SC-8850, that might allow one to create<br/>&quot;conventional&quot; orchestral sounds (albeit based, in the late 90s, on<br/>small samples) but allow one to experiment with micro tunings or<br/>temperaments.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there perhaps some software that allows VST<br/>&gt; &gt; samples to be micro tuned via MIDI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what a VST sample is, but there are software<br/>&gt; samplers that support microtuning (Kontakt and Wusikstation<br/>&gt; come to mind).</p><p>Thank you for those too. Maybe I&apos;m using the wrong term here or my<br/>usage of the acronym is incorrect or shortened beyond recognition. VST<br/>(as I see it) is a technology that allows one to use add on or, more<br/>correctly &quot;plug in&quot; software modules to a program such as a sequencer,<br/>originally Cubase from Steinberg. Frequently, it seems, that these<br/>allow one, via such a plug in, to add libraries of samples of<br/>orchestral instruments as well as others. The Garritan and EastWest<br/>libraries come to mind as examples and I believe EW uses the Native<br/>Instruments software plug in. Whilst these are, to my mind, excellent<br/>and, to me at least, amazing sample libraries, they lack the degree of<br/>spontaneity that can be achieved whilst accompanying live performers<br/>using what I refer to as a conventional &quot;sound module&quot;. MIDI was, at<br/>least as I see it, primarily designed to allow the control of<br/>electronic instruments in &quot;real time&quot;. I do accept that it is now used<br/>for things as mundane as ring tones on mobile phones with downloadable<br/>sounds today!</p><p>It seems to me that the current trend towards creating music using<br/>sample based RAM or HDD based samples is more focussed towards a<br/>finished product such as a CD or film. The latest trend is to a multi<br/>computer LAN based studio with terabytes(?) of samples spread across<br/>many hard drives.

It is itself a pitchbend retuner<br/>&gt; (both in realtime on MIDI streams and as a post-processor<br/>&gt; on MIDI files).  It can also send MIDI sysex retuning messages<br/>&gt; to a number of supported synths (see the Scala documentation).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But it&apos;s a major<br/>&gt; &gt; pain having to move all the notes of the octave into different<br/>&gt; &gt; tracks/channels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scala does that automatically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Besides which, one has then used 12 of the 16<br/>&gt; &gt; available MIDI channels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course I am talking about full scale tunings too but being<br/>&gt; &gt; able to set them on a note by note basis and, most importantly,<br/>&gt; &gt; by using a TWO byte field.  This would allow a degree of<br/>&gt; &gt; accuracy considerably greater than the rather meagre 1 cent<br/>&gt; &gt; of standard MIDI tuning and better than pitch bending<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The MIDI Tuning Standard has a 3-byte frequency data word,<br/>&gt; which gives better than .01 cents resolution according to the<br/>&gt; spec.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just because you have a message, though, doesn&apos;t mean the<br/>&gt; synthesis algorithm can give you that kind of resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As has been pointed out by many, more erudite and<br/>&gt; &gt; professional than I, for accuracy when playing chords, two<br/>&gt; &gt; decimal places of cents is really needed even to these<br/>&gt; &gt; amateur ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t agree with that, but MTS does provide it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Most manufacturers don&apos;t even bother answer the queries when<br/>&gt; &gt; asked<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is a pain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but I&apos;ll try Waldorf and Access. Thank you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The claim is that they support<br/>&gt; SINGLE NOTE TUNING CHANGE (REAL-TIME)<br/>&gt; described here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.midi.org/about-midi/tuning_extens.shtml">http://www.midi.org/about-midi/tuning_extens.shtml</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps I&apos;ll ask the MMA to ask the manufacturers.

Perhaps<br/>&gt; we could petition them to do so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>Thank you for your response, yes actually I am reasonably familiar<br/>with Scala and for use in experimentation it is a fine tool.

I suspect<br/>that I need to do some more investigation with the package and<br/>Kontakt. My problem has been, so far, that 16 channels of MIDI is<br/>generally insufficient to reproduce accurately a good quality<br/>orchestral sound without mixing some of it down to an audio track. One<br/>often doesn&apos;t know until the event exactly who is going to turn up on<br/>the day (we&apos;re talking mostly amateur productions here mostly outside<br/>of the confines of an academic influence) so pre-mixing may result in<br/>the inclusion of instruments present or not on the day. The beauty of<br/>having it all MIDI is that one can just mute the channels of the<br/>musicians present. The last (current) major project was &quot;Si. Mi<br/>chiamano Mimi&quot;.

But it&apos;s the sampler synth that gets plugged in,<br/>&gt; &gt; not the samples themselves.  The samples are sold in different<br/>&gt; &gt; file formats which can be opened by the sampler synths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed. I have EastWest symphonic orchestra silver pro edition,<br/>&gt; with thoughts, if not current budget, to upgrade to the Gold pro.<br/>&gt; I suspect that I need to do some more investigation with the<br/>&gt; package and Kontakt. My problem has been, so far, that 16 channels<br/>&gt; of MIDI is generally insufficient to reproduce accurately a good<br/>&gt; quality orchestral sound without mixing some of it down to an<br/>&gt; audio track. One often doesn&apos;t know until the event exactly who<br/>&gt; is going to turn up on the day (we&apos;re talking mostly amateur<br/>&gt; productions here mostly outside of the confines of an academic<br/>&gt; influence) so pre-mixing may result in the inclusion of<br/>&gt; instruments present or not on the day. The beauty of having it<br/>&gt; all MIDI is that one can just mute the channels of the musicians<br/>&gt; present. The last (current) major project was &quot;Si. Mi<br/>&gt; chiamano Mimi&quot;. But I&apos;ve also worked on other arias and cantatas<br/>&gt; as well as Lieder and operetta.</p><p>Er, any modern sequencer will let you have a unlimited<br/>number of tracks, each containing at least one MIDI port<br/>with its 16 channels.
