As Paul Erlich<br/>might have me add, it&apos;s noteworthy that both Marchettus of Padua in<br/>1318 and Nicola Vicentino in 1555 were champions of the direct<br/>fifthtone or diesis in radically different musical contexts.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s _archicembalo_ dividing the octave into 31 near-equal<br/>parts (1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 major thirds would be very<br/>close to 31-tET) fits a Renaissance style, just as Marchettus&apos;s<br/>fivefold division of the tone (whether we take it as a vocal tuning<br/>system roughly modelled by 29-tET, or something different) and once<br/>fits and amplifies a Gothic setting in ways still open to exploration<br/>in the 21st century.</p><p>What I want to say above all, though, is that I love 29 in ways not<br/>always so easy to put into words. I hope to make available some<br/>improvisations in this beautiful tuning soon, maybe the best<br/>commentary of all.</p><p>Thank you for your philosophical and artistically engaging articles,<br/>which add to this enthusiasm. Maybe I could add a bit of philosophy,<br/>following your very readable example, which might suggest another<br/>angle of what neo-Gothic style is about.</p><p>From one view, neo-Gothic is simply a 3-limit system: the basic ratios<br/>are 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8, plus octave complements (e.g. 16:9) or<br/>extensions (e.g. 3:1, 9:4).</p><p>At the same time however, it is a &quot;continuum-oriented system,&quot; because<br/>all of the other intervals are free to follow just about any pattern<br/>which art or fancy may suggest. Generally Pythagorean diatonicism and<br/>modality (often taken quite flexibly) do favor certain patterns, but<br/>Bob Valentine&apos;s 9-note or &quot;nonatonic&quot; scale as I call it shows how it<br/>is possible to do quite radically new things on what I might consider<br/>a &quot;neo-Pythagorean&quot; basis.</p><p>While &quot;n-limits&quot; are the basis for much discussion on this List,<br/>neo-Gothic intervals are often described in terms of &quot;flavors,&quot; with a<br/>&quot;major third&quot; -- or maybe &quot;submajor-major-supramajor third&quot; taking on<br/>any size from a bit smaller than 21:17 to around 13:10, say somewhere<br/>from 363 to 455 cents or so. This isn&apos;t to discriminate against more<br/>neutralish thirds or small fourths either.</p><p>There are 13th-14th century roots for a continuum of concord/discord,<br/>and an intonational continuum seems to give this richness a new<br/>musical dimension.</p><p>Of course, if you&apos;re curious about neo-Gothic, I&apos;d be delighted to<br/>answer questions on or off the list, and it&apos;s mainly questions which<br/>teach me how to explain things more clearly, and sometimes to how<br/>understand them more clearly myself also.</p><p>You bring an enthusiasm which is precious, a gift which deserves a<br/>response as generous as yours to my article.</p><p>                  29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29<br/>                       29    29    29    29    29<br/>                  29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
