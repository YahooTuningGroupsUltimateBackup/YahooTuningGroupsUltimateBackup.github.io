His Pythagorean version of &apos;Unanswered Question&apos; had<br/>the most awesomely beautiful sound in the string section that<br/>I&apos;ve ever heard in any performance of that piece.  At the same<br/>time, I agree with Dan Stearns that Ives&apos;s conception of tuning<br/>was far more complex than simply having one personal favorite<br/>tuning.</p><p>I looked up some stuff on Ives at the library back when<br/>this thread first started (wasn&apos;t that a couple of months<br/>ago?), thinking I might find some evidence for Pythagorean.<br/>I copied one double-page from something called &apos;Scrapbook&apos;<br/>(I think it was part of the &apos;Memos&apos; but at this point<br/>I don&apos;t remember), without having read it, because it had<br/>a scale diagram that caught my eye.</p><p>I thought at first that it was some kind of overtone graph,<br/>but upon finally reading it the other day, found that it was<br/>an interesting scale Ives had come up with, based on two pianos<br/>in his church that were about 1/4-tone out of tune and<br/>some &apos;glasses&apos; his father had made that played 1/8-tones.</p><p>Here&apos;s the quote - if someone could provide details for<br/>the citation, I&apos;d appreciate it.

I&apos;ve done<br/>my best to make an ASCII rendering of the musical example.<br/>I&apos;m not sure what the numbers I put in brackets mean - they<br/>appear in the margins of the book, and apparently refer to<br/>the cataloging of the original Ives manuscripts.</p><p>&gt; -------Charles Ives, from &apos;Scrapbook&apos;, p 108-110 --------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [51m]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... as a boy I had heard some quarter-tone experiments of<br/>&gt; Father, and this division or other divisions of the tone were<br/>&gt; not entirely unfamiliar to me.  In the Sunday-School room of<br/>&gt; the Central Presbyterian Chruch [*5], New York, there were,<br/>&gt; for a while, two pianos which happened to be just about a<br/>&gt; quarter tone apart, and I tried out a few chords then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [m51v]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this connection, and also referring to Father&apos;s glasses<br/>&gt; tuned in different intervals larger and less than quarter tones,<br/>&gt; after hearing the two pianos out of tune in Central Church (but<br/>&gt; asnear as I could tell by listening and with tuning forks, [they]<br/>&gt; were about a quarter tone apart) - a scale (to knock the octaves<br/>&gt; and fifths out by wider intervals, stretching [the] whole and<br/>&gt; half tones a little, but keeping the proportions of the scale)<br/>&gt; - it was started or suggested by these two pianos, and glasses<br/>&gt; between [the quarter tones].  But one piano was moved before I<br/>&gt; could get it well grasped [*6] in my ears.  It was mostly worked<br/>&gt; out on paper, which I have in part (see back of _The Indians_<br/>&gt; score)[*7] - taking C as basis, 5 quarter tones up = whole<br/>&gt; interval, and divided in [the] middle by [a] glass = 2&amp;1/2<br/>&gt; [quarter] tones - that is:</p><p>[monz note:  The diagram was presented horizontally by Ives;<br/>I present it vertically, and add mathematical notation from<br/>two different perspectives to specify the tuning.]</p><p>                             48-tET   Ives larger scale  Semitones<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notes in<br/>&gt; old scale<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Eb 31 -+---- 8  Doh    2^(60/48) = 2^(5/4)            15.00<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       30 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;    D  29 -+<br/>&gt;           |---- 7  Te     2^(55/48) = (2^(5/4))^(11/12)  13.75<br/>&gt;       28 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;    C# 27 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       26 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt; 8  C  25 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       24 -+<br/>&gt;           |---- 6  Lah    2^(45/48) = (2^(5/4))^(9/12)   11.25<br/>&gt; 7  B  23 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       22 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;    A# 21 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       20 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt; 6  A  19 -+<br/>&gt;           |---- 5  Soh    2^(35/48) = (2^(5/4))^(7/12)    8.75<br/>&gt;       18 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;    G# 17 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       16 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt; 5  G  15 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       14 -+<br/>&gt;           |---- 4  Fah    2^(25/48) = (2^(5/4))^(5/12)    6.25<br/>&gt;    F# 13 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       12 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt; 4  F  11 -+---- 3  Me     2^(20/48) = (2^(5/4))^(4/12)    5.00<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;       10 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt; 3  E   9 -+<br/>&gt;           |-- Re<br/>&gt;        8 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;    D#  7 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;        6 -+---- 2  Ray    2^(10/48) = (2^(5/4))^(2/12)    2.50<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt; 2  D   5 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;        4 -+<br/>&gt;           |-- De<br/>&gt;    C#  3 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt;        2 -+<br/>&gt;           |<br/>&gt; 1  C   1 -+---- 1  Doh    2^(0/48)  = (2^(5/4))^(0/12)    0.00<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [m52v]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - (playing larger scale and then regular one alternately several<br/>&gt; times - and it is quite an interesting sound difference and makes<br/>&gt; a kind of musical sense).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; New octaves, that is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                   _________<br/>&gt;                  /         |<br/>&gt;                 /<br/>&gt;                /          O<br/>&gt;               /          ---<br/>&gt;              / cycle<br/>&gt;             /            ---<br/>&gt;            /<br/>&gt;           /              ---<br/>&gt;          /<br/>&gt;         /                ---                  -O-<br/>&gt;        |<br/>&gt;    /\               -O-  ---           \      ---<br/>&gt;   | |                                   \<br/>&gt; --|-|------------------------------------\--------------------<br/>&gt;   |/                                      \<br/>&gt; --|----------------------------------------\------------------<br/>&gt;  /|                                         \<br/>&gt; |- \-----------------------------------------\----------------<br/>&gt; | / | \                                       \<br/>&gt; |-|-|-|-----------------------------------#O---\--------------<br/>&gt; \___|/          #O                     \        \<br/>&gt; ----|-----------------------------------\--------\------------<br/>&gt;  \__/                                    \         4<br/>&gt;                                           \<br/>&gt;                                            \<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------\-----------------<br/>&gt;                                              \<br/>&gt; -_____----------------------------------------\---------------<br/>&gt; /     \ .

But [the] trouble is: - [the]<br/>&gt; augmented 9th, taken as a scale length, may be confused with<br/>&gt; [the] minor 3rd.  I had some other division, where the scale<br/>&gt; ended on a quarter-tone - can&apos;t find it.  In this larger scale<br/>&gt; [monz: that is, the one presented here], there are but three<br/>&gt; intervals of even-ratio (so called): {1} the 4th [of the old<br/>&gt; scale] = [the] 3rd [of the larger scale]; or (2) from [the old]<br/>&gt; 4th to the top [of the larger scale] = minor 7th [monz: of<br/>&gt; the old scale] = [augmented]*  6th [monz: of the new scale];<br/>&gt; and [3] the sum of (1) + (2) = from C to Eb top = minor 10th<br/>&gt; [monz: of the old scale = &apos;octave&apos; of the larger scale].<br/>&gt;</p><p>*[monz note: The editor is wrong here; &apos;6th&apos; refers not to<br/>  the equivalence of the 12-tET or meantone &apos;augmented 6th&apos;<br/>  = &apos;minor 7th&apos;, but rather indicates that this is the large<br/>  scale&apos;s analog of the &apos;major 6th&apos;.]</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other intervals are uneven - some way out from a simple<br/>&gt; ratio [as] 2/1 - for instance 261/712 etc.  This, at first,<br/>&gt; seemed very disturbing, - but when the ears have heard more and<br/>&gt; more (and year after year) of uneven ratios, one begins to feel<br/>&gt; that the use, recognition, and meaning (as musical expression)<br/>&gt; of intervals have just begun to be heard and understood.  The<br/>&gt; even ratios have been pronounced the true basis of music,<br/>&gt; because man limits his ear, and not because nature does.  The<br/>&gt; even ratios have one thing that got them and has kept them in<br/>&gt; the limelight of humanity - and one thing that has kept the<br/>&gt; progress to wider and more uneven ratios very slow - (it is said<br/>&gt; [that] for the power of man&apos;s ear to stand up against the<br/>&gt; comparatively uneven 3rds, [when used] to the very even octaves<br/>&gt; and 5ths, was a matter of centuries) - in other words, consonance<br/>&gt; has had a monopolistic tyranny, for this one principal reason:<br/>&gt; - it is *easy* for the ear and mind to use and know them - and<br/>&gt; the more uneven the ratio, the harder it is.
