Anyway,<br/>&gt; my attempt to achieve pitch bend with it was completely unsuccessful<br/>&gt; (returning to the pitch-bend menu showed that my input hadn&apos;t even<br/>&gt; been accepted), and I wonder what I&apos;m doing wrong.  Since you guys<br/>&gt; are old hands at this, I would appreciate your directing me to<br/>&gt; whatever places I need to go to get some help with this.</p><p>While it&apos;s quite limited, you&apos;ll still probably find this useful:</p><p>A couple of years ago I wrote a tiny program to run in Cakewalk&apos;s<br/>CAL language, which I call &quot;<a href="http://micro.cal">micro.cal</a>&quot; :<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/micro/micro.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/micro/micro.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://Micro.cal">Micro.cal</a> allows you to step-input each note as a ratio,<br/>and it automatically inserts the pitch-bend event, with<br/>the proper pitch-bend value accurate to within 2 cents,<br/>to that note.  Then you have to go back and adjust &quot;8ves&quot;<br/>afterwards, but it&apos;s a lot easier than adding pitch-bend<br/>by hand, which is how I normally do it.</p><p>If you want to do it by hand, I find this to be the easiest way:</p><p>1: Enter the nearest 12-EDO pitches into your track.</p><p>2: Clone that track to an empty track, then look at the note-list<br/>    in Event List view, and you can quickly scroll thru each<br/>    event and change it from a note-on to a pitch-bend.</p><p>3: Still in Event List view, type in all the new pitch-bend<br/>    values.</p><p>By cloning the original track first, you save yourself from<br/>having to actually enter all the pitch-bend data from scratch,<br/>and all the timings are already correct.</p><p>If you&apos;re going to immerse yourself in this world, you&apos;ll<br/>probably also find yourself wanting to use this a lot:</p><p>&quot;7-limit pitch-bend lattice&quot; :<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/pitch-bend-lattice.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/lattices/pitch-bend-lattice.htm</a></p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=32984 href="#32984">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2002 4:35:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you want to do it by hand, I find this to be the easiest way:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1: Enter the nearest 12-EDO pitches into your track.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2: Clone that track to an empty track, then look at the note-list<br/>&gt;     in Event List view, and you can quickly scroll thru each<br/>&gt;     event and change it from a note-on to a pitch-bend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3: Still in Event List view, type in all the new pitch-bend<br/>&gt;     values.</p><p>Here&apos;s another way: take a midi file and convert it to a Csound score file.
