I want to thank Paul Erlich for placing files in<br/>the<br/>&quot;files&quot; section of this website, since it &quot;inspired&quot; (rather &quot;forced&quot;<br/>in a way) me to investigate it.</p><p>In fact, I have decided to TOTALLY go Web with egroups, NO DIGESTS or<br/>e-mail... strictly Web-based posting.</p><p>There are some nice features that people have already put up on the<br/>egroups site, in addition to Paul&apos;s beautiful graphic files of which<br/>I<br/>was TOTALLY unaware:</p><p>Manuel op de Coul has the FULL TUNING BIBLIOGRAPHY IN HTML up there!!<br/>and also, he placed a COMPREHENSIVE list of alternate tuning CDs<br/>there.  They are in his folder, named rather inconspicuously &quot;docs.&quot;</p><p>There are some other nice features, like a DATABASE...  I&apos;ve started<br/>a<br/>FAQ there, since some of us have been talking about starting a FAQ<br/>somewhere.  The first question I asked concerned the acoustic basis<br/>for utonal chords.  I didn&apos;t answer the question, since I would not<br/>be<br/>the person to do it (!!)  However, I did make the settings &quot;anyone<br/>can<br/>update it&quot; which I think would be wise for such a FAQ.  Might<br/>development of this FAQ right on the egroups website be a good idea??</p><p>As you can also see, I started a &quot;poll,&quot; another nice feature that we<br/>might consider using in the future.  The &quot;poll&quot; I started had to do<br/>with multilingual posts... the question that Joe Monzo recently<br/>asked.<br/>Personally, I feel the idea is a good one.  With an English &quot;hack&quot;<br/>translation and the original French or German text, or whatever... we<br/>might more easily be able to understand some of our international<br/>posters...</p><p>Explore the web-based options to the left of the screen on<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com">www.egroups.com</a>.

On a check of the files section, I do have one suggestion: if  anyone is really hot to trot and post things to share, could you *please* take the time to make a folder (directory) to store those items. This isn&apos;t a snipe at Paul, but if everyone just starts posting single files it will quickly become a scroll-and-&apos;next page&apos; nightmare through lots and lots of disconnected material.</p><p>_Surely_ all of the people that value neatness of calculations can understand this kind of very, very minor housekeeping?</p><p>And I agree: this is *just* (no pun...) the kind of holding area the list has needed. Now everyone can have a tuning-list-centric site of their own stuff right online in one place. Fire up those free web tools, kids...</p><p>Best all,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=11690 href="#11690">ðŸ”—</a>J.P.FFITCH@MATHS.BATH.AC.UK</h3><span>8/22/2000 4:24:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Using the web is not always a helpful facility.  It requires continual<br/>access to the telephone system while reading, unlike e-mail which is a<br/>bulk process.  I read mail at home and not with the net attached.  It<br/>may not be as bad as in Hungary but I see web access as expensive and<br/>so would not contribute to the web poll.  This could of course bias<br/>the poll in favour of those in countries with free local phone calls.<br/>==John ffitch</p></div>
