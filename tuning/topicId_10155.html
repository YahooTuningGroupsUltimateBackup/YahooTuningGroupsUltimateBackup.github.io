It&apos;s at least a good thing to know<br/>&gt; that if you are giving a mixed program and don&apos;t have time to retune in<br/>&gt; the middle you can play 16th and 17th century music PLUS Mozart on the<br/>&gt; same keyboard, with maybe readjusting the g#&apos;s, but if you want to play<br/>&gt; the same early stuff with Bach or Telemann or Haydn you might be in<br/>&gt; trouble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Judy</p><p>It&apos;s neither underground nor heretical. Some form of meantone was standard<br/>in Vienna throughout Mozart&apos;s career, with Kirnberger&apos;s writings introducing<br/>alternatives only in the late 1770&apos;s, possibly through the coincidence that<br/>Baron von Swieten, a patron of Mozart and both patron and collaborator of<br/>Haydn, served as Austrian embassador in Berlin, where von Swieten became<br/>familiar with Kirnberger.  T&iuml;&iquest;&half;rk (1787) writes from Saxony of Kirnberger&apos;s<br/>tuning that it was &quot;not yet generally used&quot; but was indeed &quot;the contemporary<br/>tuning&quot; -- it was, so to speak, the coming thing from Northern Germany, but<br/>probably too late for Mozart.</p><p>For just one example of how deeply meantone habits are mapped into Mozart&apos;s<br/>tonal practice, consider that he used only one minor key as tonic in his<br/>symphonies: meantone&apos;s optimal g minor.  He was, of course, court organist<br/>in Salzburg, where he probably worked in sixth-comma meantone.  On the other<br/>hand, late Haydn definitely takes advantage of the newly available key<br/>ranges in the circular temperaments (and Haydn&apos;s practice in this regard<br/>certainly influenced Beethoven).

Wiener Klassik_.</p></div><h3>MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL</h3><span>5/24/2000 9:28:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf:<br/>&gt; Baron von Swieten, a patron of Mozart and both patron and collaborator of</p><p>Baron van Swieten, he was Dutch.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2000 1:07:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL">MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf:<br/>&gt; &gt; Baron von Swieten, a patron of Mozart and both patron and collaborator<br/>of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Baron van Swieten, he was Dutch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sorry -- my new email program thought it was correcting a mistake in German!</p><p>Van Swieten was indeed born in Leiden, but came to Vienna at the age of 12.<br/>It was as a citizen of Austria that he served as both a diplomat to Berlin<br/>(where he _probably_ studied with Kirnberger and Marpurg) and laster as<br/>director of the court library.
