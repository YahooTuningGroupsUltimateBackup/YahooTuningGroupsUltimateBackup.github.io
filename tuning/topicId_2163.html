I pumped him for info about the<br/>scale and its precise tuning. Alas, he *only* knew how to play the thing,<br/>:-) and knew very little theory. But of course I did learn that the drones<br/>were one and two octaves below the low A of the chanter, and that the<br/>chanter plays only 9 notes which are called by pipers (and notated on the<br/>staff as): low G, low A, B, C, D, E, F, high G, high A, but in fact sharps<br/>are assumed on the C and F. It would be a D major scale if it weren&apos;t for<br/>the fact that the drones are A&apos;s. So it&apos;s approximately a Myxolidian mode,<br/>but it actually evolved to allow playing in 3 different pentatonic scales<br/>against the drones. G A B D E, D E F# A B and A B C# E F#.</p><p>Also, the low so-called A is no longer 440Hz (if it ever was) but is today<br/>typically 466Hz (which makes it a Bb). We won&apos;t worry about that.</p><p>This piper was kind enough to offer to obtain the tuning information and<br/>mail it to me. In the meantime, I looked up Manuel&apos;s archive and found the<br/>following:</p><p>! bagpipe2.scl<br/>!<br/>Highland Bagpipe, from Acustica4: 231 (1954) J.M.A Lenihan and S. McNeill</p><p> 7<br/>!<br/> 9/8   !B     [I&apos;ve added these note-name comments.

And why not 7/4 for the G&apos;s. It&apos;s even<br/>conceivable that the F# might be 13/8 (44c flatter).</p><p>If you plot the above as a 5-limit lattice it *is* nice and symmetrical</p><p>F#  C#<br/>  (A)  E   B<br/>         G   D</p><p>I went searching on the web for more information and found plenty about<br/>bagpipes but not the precise tuning. I learnt of the existence of the<br/>newsgroup rec.music.makers.bagpipe and, after scouring their FAQ to no<br/>avail, posted the question there.</p><p>I received an excellent well-researched reply, that raised alomost as many<br/>questions as it answered. It seems GHB tuning has changed since 1954. But<br/>I&apos;ll leave that for another day, so you can think about it for a while.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2171 href="#2171">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/1999 6:04:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dave Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;]<br/>Dear Ewan, I just received in the mail, from the piper friend who got me<br/>started on this, the official tuning of the Australian Pipe Band College<br/>(below).  This was specified by Allan Chatto in 1991. They give only the<br/>frequencies in Hz, I added the ratios:</p><p>   Hz   Ratio to low A<br/>A&apos; 932  2<br/>G&apos; 839  1.800<br/>F  777  1.667 (F#)<br/>E  699  1.5<br/>D  622  1.335<br/>C  583  1.251 (C#)<br/>B  525  1.127<br/>A  466  1<br/>G  420  0.901</p><p>[Ewan A. Macpherson &lt;<a href="mailto:emacpher@umich.edu">emacpher@umich.edu</a>&gt;, Kresge Hearing Research<br/>Institute, <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/</a>]<br/>&apos;Official tuning&apos;, eh?  I&apos;ve never seen something like this before!<br/>There&apos;s definitely no standard pitch these days.  For solo playing it<br/>really doesn&apos;t matter (except timbrally), but of course bands have to<br/>agree within themselves.  It depends what make of chanter you&apos;re<br/>playing, what make of reed, the ambient temperature etc!  466 Hz is a<br/>bit low these days.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>I probably overstated its officialness and standardisation. It does allow a<br/>range of frequencies for the low A reference. You can see the whole thing<br/>as a GIF at<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/AFPBAtuning.gif">http://dkeenan.com/Music/AFPBAtuning.gif</a></p><p>Those G&apos;s are clearly 9/5&apos;s and no hint of a flattened high A. Behind the<br/>times eh?</p><p>[Macpherson]<br/>Well, I wouldn&apos;t cry if the flat A were abolished!  People may not be<br/>aware exactly what they&apos;re doing to get &apos;that sound&apos;.</p><p>Of course just because this is the official tuning, doesn&apos;t mean people<br/>are actually using it.  For instance I just measured high and low Gs<br/>from the Victoria Police Pipe Band (winners of the World Championship<br/>last year) from a 1993 recording. [Victoria is a state of Australia. DK]<br/>The low Gs were actually a hair flat of 7/8 and the high Gs were bang on<br/>7/4.  Their high A was about 10 cents flat which is normal.  Bands don&apos;t go<br/>tend for the extreme flattening.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to find you a quote from a book by Royce Lerwick (a<br/>rec.music.makers.bagpipe regular) explaining the flat A rationale in a<br/>band context.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>At least the D is 4/3 and not that whacky 27/20.</p><p>[Macpherson]<br/>Just as evidence that the sharp D has not vanished from the face of the<br/>earth, I measured the D from a recording of Dugald MacNeill, who is the<br/>director of the College of Piping in Glasgow and the author of the<br/>Piping Times article from which I got the pentatonic info.  It came out<br/>at a ratio of 1.344, which is 8 cents flat of 27/20, but 12 cents sharp<br/>of 4/3.  Since there&apos;s apparently no strong dissonance minimum there, I<br/>expect it would be hard to &apos;find&apos; 27/20 exactly.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>Those modern 7/4 G&apos;s are a big problem if pipers want to play with 12-tET<br/>instruments. When the pipes&apos; low A is tuned to the 12-tET Bb (466.16Hz) the<br/>errors of 12-tET range from -4 cents (B) to +31c (7/4 G).</p><p>Aha! We can minimise the absolute errors by making the pipes&apos; low A 13.5c<br/>sharper than the 12-tET Bb so the errors range from -17.5c to +17.5c<br/>(better but hardly tolerable). I get 469.85Hz as the optimum low A for this<br/>purpose. 470Hz in round figures. It could also be acheived (within 0.2c) by<br/>tuning the pipe C# to the 12-tET D.</p><p>Could it be that pipers are tuning the high A to the 12-tET Bb under this<br/>condition thereby making it approx 13.5c flat? But if so, the question of<br/>why still remains.</p><p>[Macpherson]<br/>An interesting direction of inquiry!  However, piping is, in general, a<br/>pretty closed world.  Some of the top soloists probably wouldn&apos;t be<br/>caught dead playing with other instruments. I&apos;d guess the pressure for<br/>ET-compliance is close to zero. I&apos;d like to measure the tuning of<br/>pipers who play in folk groups or folk rock bands.  From listening, I<br/>suspect they just barge ahead without worrying about the tuning<br/>nicities too much. Some pipemakers do make A-440 chanters for pipers<br/>who have to play with orchestras, or who just prefer the lower pitch.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>I realise now, that even if it were a consideration, the (optimised) error<br/>range has hardly changed.<br/>When the G&apos;s were 9/5 the optimum low A was 465.90Hz, giving 12-tET errors<br/>of +-16.6c.<br/>When the D&apos;s were also 27/20 the optimum low A was 465.64Hz, giving 12-tET<br/>errors of +-17.6c).</p><p>But why go higher than 470Hz, as some do?</p><p>[Macpherson]<br/>The rise in pitch has been attributed to the belief that a brighter<br/>sound will give an advantage in pipe band competitions.  There seems to<br/>be a growing feeling that this has gone far enough.  Again, the pipes<br/>are generally tuned to whatever pitch they happen to be working best at<br/>on a given day - not to any fixed standard.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>I&apos;m sure I speak for many when I say: Thanks Ewan, for your excellent<br/>article and for taking the time to discuss these things for the benefit of<br/>myself and the alternative tuning list.</p><p>[Macpherson]<br/>You are most welcome.  It&apos;s nice to have some interest from outside of piping.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>Manuel, how about some more bagpipe entries in the scale archive, based on<br/>Dr Macpherson&apos;s research? We should also make it clear that the 12-tone<br/>scale given in &apos;bagpipe.scl&apos; is (I assume) for the Uilleann (pron. ILL-en)<br/>pipes.</p><p>The Ewan&apos;s index to piping sites is at<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/pipes.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/pipes.html</a></p><p>But of particular interest to this list are Ewan&apos;s own bagpipe research<br/>reports via<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/pipes/ewanstuff.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emacpher/pipes/ewanstuff.html</a><br/>only some of which have been mentioned in this thread.</p><p>On this page Ewan writes:<br/>&quot;If I had a wealthy patron (hint, hint) I&apos;d spend a lot of time studying<br/>the acoustics of the bagpipes and the use of expressive timing in GHB music.&quot;</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2173 href="#2173">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/1999 7:52:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dave Keenan]<br/>Any luck with finding that quote from Royce Lerwick&apos;s book, explaining the<br/>flat A rationale in a band context.</p><p>[Ewan Mcpherson]<br/>Yeah, here goes:</p><p>&quot;... The trick, however, is to set the high A a bit flat from a true<br/>octave - about 10 cents flat.  This allows room for overblowing, as you<br/>will not be blowing steady even after years of mastery.</p><p>Setting up exactly an octave apart means you will vary sharp with every<br/>step and pothole.  The most annoying sound in the world is a sharp high<br/>A.  It is better to be ranging a bit flat - even in many minds better<br/>than a true octave if you could blow absolutely steady, because of the<br/>weird harmonics up there - than to ever come close to crossing the line<br/>into the sharp zone.  10 cents is not all that much, and actually, many<br/>big name pipers and big bands made their fame set up as much as 25<br/>cents flat.&quot;</p><p>- Royce Lerwick, The Pipe Major&apos;s Handbook, 2nd ed. p 63.</p><p>This all seems pretty reasonable except for the mysterious comment<br/>about &quot;weird harmonics&quot;.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div>
