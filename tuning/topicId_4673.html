Now onelist has fixed the troubles and I can post myself, so if<br/>the message also appears sent from Paul then it is my fault, sorry]</p><p>I have been investigateing into scales, that have exactly 3 different step<br/>sizes (between successive scale members), in different equal divisions, and<br/>also from ratio-based (n-limit) systems. Would anyone let me know what of<br/>these scales people are using, and what properties of structure are enjoyed<br/>about them? I would appreciate a post to the list or private email if you<br/>prefer, or references. Such scales I find to be interesting compromise<br/>betwen simple two-step-size and many-different-step-size from perceptual<br/>point of view, and they can have some nice maths properties.</p><p>Also, there are scales like the ordinary (syntonic) diatonic most people use<br/>for diatonic just intonation, who has scale steps of 9:8, 10:9 and 16:15.<br/>This does have 3 step sizes, but because the two tone sizes are easy<br/>equivalenced one can also say, that it is an &quot;approximation&quot; of a scale with<br/>*two* step sizes (by which I mean not to say that a two-step-size version<br/>(e.g. Pythagorean 9:8 and 256:243) is better, and the J.I. &quot;merely&quot;<br/>approximates it, of cours, but hopfully you see what I mean).</p><p>So my other questions are: what J.I. scales (any cardinality) of greater<br/>complexity might be used (or &quot;do you use&quot;) to &quot;approximate&quot;, in that meaning<br/>I just explained, a scale of three-step-sizes? So I look for J.I. scales<br/>whose step-sizes {s_1, s_2, ... s_i} can be collapsed into three equivalence<br/>classes {S_1, S_2, S_3} such that all the s_i in S_1 are &quot;much&quot; closer to<br/>each other than they are to the s_i in S_2 or S_3, if that makes sense.</p><p>And lastlly, a general question: have models been proposd, who describe, and<br/>explain a rationale for, this kind of equivalenceing of different J.I.<br/>intervals into classes?</p><p>Thank you very much for any answers you have for me. I was reading this list<br/>for some time now, and I&apos;m sorry to first post only with all this questions.<br/>I will let you know of the result of my investigateions.</p><p>Luzius    p.s. I will try to explain better if anything is not clear, sorry.</p></div><h3><a id=4714 href="#4714">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/1999 2:31:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Luzius Lanrai:]<br/>&gt; Also, there are scales like the ordinary (syntonic) diatonic most<br/>people use for diatonic just intonation, who has scale steps of 9:8,<br/>10:9 and 16:15.

Erlich:]<br/>&gt;Another one is my 22-tET blues scale, which is JI is: 1/1 6/5 4/3<br/>27/20 3/2 9/5 (2/1), where the three step sizes are 81:80 (really<br/>small in JI), 10:9, and 6:5.</p><p>I think that this is an interesting example, because in a scale like<br/>this I really think there is a big difference between the 1/22 and the<br/>81/80 - as the 1/22 sounds like a scale step, or perhaps to put it<br/>another way, the 27/20 can rather politely disappear<br/>(phantasmagorically so to speak...) into the 4/3, whereas the 10/22<br/>most certainly (to my ears anyway) will not.</p><p>&gt;I think Luzius may have been more interested in scales with more than<br/>three steps sizes that fall into three general size-categories.</p><p>Using the same (two tetrad) method you can also generate these types<br/>of scales, say a 1/1, 19/15, 19/12, 19/10 + 20/19, 4/3, 5/3, 2/1,<br/>which could easily be seen as a +1 +3 +1 +3 +1 +2 +1 in 12e where the<br/>four step sizes fall into three general size-categories. Incidentally,<br/>you could also create seven note scales with four distinct step sizes<br/>using the same process, say the 10/9, 27/25, 21/20 &amp; 81/70 of a<br/>5:6:7:9, or a (rather unusual) 1/1, 17/13, 17/11, 17/9 + 18/17, 18/13,<br/>18/11, 2/1 which could then be recast (at least as far as recognizing<br/>four distinct step sizes is concerned) into 13, 17, 21, 23, 24, 25,<br/>26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, (etc.) equal divisions of the octave.</p><p>&gt;One example is the JI harmonic minor, 1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 15/8<br/>2/1. There are steps of 16:15, 10:9, 9:8, and 75:64, but 10:9 and 9:8<br/>tend to merge into a single category.</p><p>What about something like a 12:14:18:21 (@: 1/1, 8/7, 7/6, 4/3, 3/2,<br/>12/7, 7/4, 2/1), where in say 22e the 8/7 &amp; the 9/8 would both be<br/>taken, or &quot;merge into a single category,&quot; at 4/22, whereas 26e would<br/>differentiate, or recognize (@: 5/26 &amp; 4/26) the two... where does one<br/>draw the lines with these types of general size-categories? The points<br/>that John Chalmers made (in TD 306.9) about contextual sensitivity to<br/>commas (&quot;Scales in the same equivalence class, defined as having the<br/>same rank-order matrix, tend to be heard as retuning of each other.<br/>However, this perception depends upon one&apos;s sensitivity to small pitch<br/>deviations in context. Some listeners in some contexts might hear the<br/>Pythagorean, 12-tet, meantone, and 5-limit JI versions of the major<br/>scale as the same scale.&quot;) seems to me to indicate that the &apos;answer&apos;<br/>would have to take into account both the specifics of musical<br/>contexts, and the individual abilities and limitations of a potential<br/>listeners... I would think that with these two examples, 1/1, 8/7,<br/>7/6, 4/3, 3/2, 12/7, 7/4, 2/1 in 22 &amp; 26e, that it would primarily be<br/>a choice between &apos;cleaning up&apos; commas (22e), or fully recognizing them<br/>within the scope of an equal division (26e).</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=4737 href="#4737">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/1999 6:01:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Luzius Lanrai:]<br/>&gt;I am most interested in J.I. scales (and n-tet &gt; 12) that are not of<br/>same cardinality as diatonic scale i.e. 7, and are difficultly<br/>approximate by 12-tone equal.</p><p>One thing that quickly jumps to mind, and makes use of the same<br/>scales-from-chords method, would be to take an overtone sequence up to<br/>a &lt;600&#xFFFD; (or not, as you could also sequentially straighten everything<br/>out after the fact, so to speak) point, and then finish the octave<br/>starting on the overtones of the inversion of the last note... say<br/>12:13:14:15:16 for example, this would give a nine note scale @: 1/1,<br/>13/12, 7/6, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 13/8, 7/4, 15/8, 2/1, with five step sizes<br/>falling into three general size-categories... or an eleven note scale<br/>at 15:16:17:18:19:20 (1/1, 17/15, 6/5, 19/15, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 17/10,<br/>9/5, 19/10, 2/1) with six step sizes falling into the same type of<br/>three general size-categories...
