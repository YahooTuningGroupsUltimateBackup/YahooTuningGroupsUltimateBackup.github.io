He acknowledges Ptolemy, and sets it out<br/>like this:</p><p>C    D   E     F   G    A   B<br/> 10:9 9:8 16:15 9:8 10:9 9:8 16:15</p><p>         |_____|___|____|<br/>      (Ptolemy&apos;s diaton syntonon)</p><p>[Interestingly, this tuning can be found even earlier, in _Musica<br/>practica_ by Ramos de Pareja of Bologna, in 1482!  He lays it out from A-a<br/>though, as was standard in texts of the time. His student Spataro reported<br/>that he arrived at this division independently from Ptolemy. It&apos;s indeed<br/>unlikely Ramos would have had access to the Greek sources.]</p><p>So Zarlino, who acknowledges Fogliano as an excellent writer on music,<br/>certainly knew Fogliano sets the octave division out from C to c. He gives<br/>his division, which permutes the 9:8 and 10:9 from the beginning of<br/>Fogliano&apos;s, and lists no less than 6 reasons why C-c should be considered<br/>first, some better than others... Paraphrasing:</p><p>1) C-c is the model for pure tuning. (This he explains at length - all<br/>the things about harmonic division, and ratios from the senario)</p><p>2) The second reason is a little unclear to me. It has to do with the<br/>solmization syllables, and I think it&apos;s that if you start on &quot;ut&quot; you<br/>don&apos;t have to mutate (i.e. if you had to sing A-c you can&apos;t call that<br/>la-ut, you have to have switched to another hexachord by then).</p><p>3) A was probably only selected to be the first octave species<br/>because it&apos;s the first letter of the alphabet [!] Thus we can discard the<br/>ordering starting on A.</p><p>4) If you list the modes by their finals starting on C, you never jump<br/>over a note: C-D-E-F-G-A is an unbroken chain, whereas D-E-F-G-A-C has a<br/>skip.</p><p>5) Since the syllables for hexachordal solmization go &quot;ut, re, mi, fa,<br/>sol&quot;, then the modes should be arranged to reflect the same ordering.</p><p>6) This is a cool one: Zarlino tried to reconstruct the ordering of the<br/>ancient Greek modes from Ptolemy. He misunderstood, and believed that<br/>since Dorian and Phrygian, and Phrygian and Lydian, were a whole-tone<br/>apart, they must be C-D-E. Since he wanted to call Dorian mode 1,<br/>reflecting its importance in Greek theory, this means making C-c mode 1.<br/>He gets the following names (this is from the Dimostrationi harmoniche,<br/>1571):<br/>C-c Dorian<br/>D-d Phrygian<br/>E-e Lydian<br/>F-f Mixolydian<br/>G-g Ionian<br/>A-a Aeolian<br/>which he thought reflected ancient Greek usage. (In reality the Greek<br/>modes were like this: Dorian e-E, Phrygian d-D etc.)</p><p>He abandoned these names for the 2nd edition of the _Istitutioni<br/>harmoniche_ in 1573 - I guess because he knew it was confusing when<br/>everyone already knew a different set of names.</p><p>See you --Jon</p></div><h3><a id=15483 href="#15483">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

(I take<br/>it the minor seventh resolving into the perfect fifth and the major second<br/>resolving into the perfect fourth had largely disappeared?) So it seems that<br/>one could use these to &quot;tonicize&quot; the following modes:</p><p>C mode:<br/>  B-c<br/>  D-C</p><p>E mode:<br/>  d-e<br/>  F-E<br/>or<br/>  A-B<br/>  F-E</p><p>F mode:<br/>  e-f<br/>  G-F<br/>or<br/>  B-c<br/>  G-F</p><p>A mode:<br/>  F-E<br/>  G-A</p><p>while the D and G modes would require chromatic alterations? (Actually, even<br/>if the m7-5 and M2-4 resolutions were still allowed, how would one<br/>&quot;tonicize&quot; the D and G modes without any alterations? How was it done in<br/>Medieval times (if such a concept of tonicization is at all applicable)?)</p><p>In any case, it is my belief that once thirds functioned as fully recognized<br/>consonances for long enough, and bare 3-limit sonorities had been excluded<br/>from the musical texture for long enough, these old directed resolutions<br/>would have been overshadowed by the greater (in fact, maximal, among<br/>diatonic possibilities,) incisiveness of the resolution from the diminished<br/>fifth into the major third (or the augmented fourth into the minor sixth).<br/>Thus the dominant directed progression became, sometime in the early or<br/>middle Baroque,</p><p>F-e<br/>B-c,</p><p>and this would clearly tonicize only the C mode. The notes C and E also<br/>belong to the tonic triad of the A mode, though since the tonic A is not<br/>part of the &quot;goal&quot; interval, a chromatic alteration is needed to fully<br/>tonicize it. Thus the modern major and minor modes rose to prevalence.</p><p>The point to emphasize is that I think it is pure coincidence that Zarlino<br/>and others focused on the C mode when they did, since they had no way of<br/>knowing of its future ascendancy.

It&apos;s a worthy project, maybe when I&apos;m a bit<br/>further along with the neo-Gothic series.</p><p>For now, I would emphasize that the total musical effect is quite<br/>different than either 14th-century or 18th-century verticality. As a<br/>medievalist, I may focus on the medieval elements, while people<br/>oriented to major/minor tonality often read 18th-century<br/>interpretations into 16th-century progressions later incorporated into<br/>the key system.</p><p>For example, Vicentino and Zarlino discuss the resolution of tritone<br/>tension (e.g. d5-M3) as a pleasing feature of style, but this is just<br/>one cadential possibility, as opposed to _the_ defining element of<br/>cadentiality or modality.</p><p>Note generally that in standard 16th-century styles (as contrasted to<br/>avant-garde compositions near the end of the century), seconds and<br/>sevenths are more restricted than in either 13th-14th century or<br/>17th-century and later practice. It&apos;s interesting that a bold<br/>progression such as m7-5 occurs boldly both in Machaut and in the late<br/>Manneristic modality of the early 17th century, but is foreign to<br/>orthodox 16th-century style, where prominent sevenths occur mainly as<br/>more restrained suspensions.</p><p>Glareanus and Zarlino recognize 12 modes: the usual eight medieval<br/>ones, plus authentic and plagal versions of Aeolian (A-A) and Ionian<br/>(C-C). Zarlino specifically states that Ionian is the most popular<br/>mode in Italy for dances. Both also note that the Aeolian and Ionian<br/>modes are older in practice than in theory, a point on which I could<br/>enlarge. An important point is that these modes -- unlike major and<br/>minor keys which appear to be based on similar octave-species -- are<br/>open to the usual fluid accidental inflections, e.g. B/Bb or F/F#.</p><p>An important point about Zarlino&apos;s harmonic aesthetic: he generally<br/>urges that composers alternate the harmonic division of the fifth<br/>(string-ratio 15:12:10, major third below minor third) with the<br/>arithmetic division (6:5:4, minor third below major third). This<br/>fluidity is one of the most pleasing features, at least to me, of<br/>16th-century verticality.</p><p>Also, for Zarlino, the principal degrees of a mode on which to place<br/>cadences are the first, third, and fifth -- e.g. C, E, and G in<br/>Ionian or D, F, and A in Dorian. This invites a discussion of<br/>traditional schemes of finals and confinals, another topic; but I did<br/>want to clarify which degrees Zarlino generally considers primary.</p><p>To conclude for now, I would emphasize the importance of viewing the<br/>whole picture: the variety of basic two-voice progressions, old and<br/>new; the plurality of modes; the balance of conjunct and disjunct bass<br/>motions; the fluidity of accidental inflections both in orthodox and<br/>not-so-orthodox styles.</p><p>Since 16th-century music grows out of medieval traditions and provides<br/>the basis for 17th-century developments leading to the key system of<br/>Corelli (c. 1680), it has resemblances to both systems, but its own<br/>special qualities (e.g. the rather homogenous 5-odd-limit textures, as<br/>opposed to the bolder contrasts of concord/discord or &quot;harmonic<br/>entropy&quot; in earlier as well as later styles).</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s modal ethos focuses both on the division of the fifth<br/>(harmonic or arithmetic) above the final, and on the structure of<br/>pentachords and tetrachords making up an octave species. Thus<br/>Mixolydian (G-G) shares with Ionian (C-C) and Lydian (F-F) the more<br/>&quot;natural&quot; and &quot;joyful&quot; harmonic division above the final; and it<br/>shares with Dorian (D-D) the upper tetrachordal structure T-S-T<br/>(Mixolydian D-E-F-G; Dorian A-B-C-D).</p><p>This is an attempt to be quick, fragmentary, but maybe responsive to<br/>some of the immediate questions raised.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=15537 href="#15537">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
