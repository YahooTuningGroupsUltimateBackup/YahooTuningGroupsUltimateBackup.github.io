Draw a polygon that joins up the<br/>outermost notes of the scale so there are no notes of the scale<br/>_outside_ that polygon. Check that the polygon is convex, i.e. if it<br/>has any indentations (concavities) then bridge across them until there<br/>are no more. (e.g. a pentagram is not convex while a regular pentagon<br/>is.) This is called the convex-hull of the set of points.</p><p>Now if there are any points _inside_ the convex-hull that do not<br/>represent notes of the scale, then we say the scale is not convex.</p><p>In the 3-dimensional case you will be joining up planar faces between<br/>triangles of points until you have a convex polyhedron. If there are<br/>points inside that that are not in the scale then the scale is not<br/>convex.</p><p>There are analogous conditions for more than 3 dimensions but of<br/>course these are not directly visualisable.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2005 6:24:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Could someone explain to me what &apos;convex&apos; means in relationship to<br/>&gt; scales or as a property.</p><p>Suppose you took a 5-limit JI scale with octave periodicity, so that the<br/>notes of the scale are equivalent to a finite set of lattice points on<br/>the 5-limit lattice of pitch classes.

The hexany is<br/>in a lattice with generators {3,5,7}; however, we can take a lattice<br/>with generators of (close approximations to) 49/49 and 10/7, and then<br/>some scale which is audibly very close to the hexany, and identical to<br/>it if we decide to tune both to 441 equal, will no longer be convex.<br/>Considered as a set of notes in the circle of major thirds for 441,<br/>the notes clearly are not contiguous and thus in that picture not convex.</p><p>We can take the same 441 notes to the octave and arrange them so that<br/>they are in a Fokker-block like structure in three dimensions, and<br/>look at everything in terms of {3,5,7}. Or we can arrange the notes<br/>in two dimensions, with neutral thirds and 10/7 generators. Or we can<br/>use neutral thirds and 27/25 (1/9 octave) generators, and wrap it<br/>around. We can, in other words, impose a multitude of different<br/>structures on the *same* 441 notes of the octave, and what structure<br/>we choose will determine what we think is convex or not convex.</p><p>&gt; Convexity (or near-convexity) is simply a consequence of wanting to<br/>&gt; maximise connectivity, i.e. wanting to get as many consonant intervals<br/>&gt; as possible with our few notes.</p><p>Exactly, and this remains true even in the very simple case of a MOS.<br/>But we should not fail to note that there may be many different ways<br/>to organize the same notes, leading to different theories about what<br/>is convex, and hence different choices as to what seems optimal.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2005 5:03:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hanson, who is the one who took the chain of 6/5s thought of 19 as a temperment as far as i know.
