Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2002 11:18:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Julia Werntz and everyone.</p><p>Thank you for most courteous reply to my previous &quot;sisterly response,&quot;<br/>and I am happily able now to participate in a more informed dialogue,<br/>having found and read your PNM article. I&apos;m pleased to say that your<br/>discussion of small melodic steps gave me the idea for a delightful<br/>exercise for exploring step sizes that I tried today and love -- what<br/>a gift!</p><p>That in itself was more than enough reason to read your article; I<br/>realize that also I was discovering something about how another<br/>musician and theorist views the universe of sound and composition,<br/>always an enriching process that also may help me view my own<br/>experience in better perspective.</p><p>There is a humorous story to tell which may demonstrate my<br/>fallibilities, but first I would like to affirm a most important<br/>point.</p><p>In the circumstances of last week, as I now realize, I could have and<br/>should have indeed posted an article affirming friendship and<br/>hospitality, and maybe sharing some of _my_ views, but carefully<br/>avoiding and indeed renouncing any attempt to address _your_ views,<br/>even by possible inference, until I had had a chance to read your<br/>article.</p><p>Expressing my appreciation for your understanding of my good intent, I<br/>must nevertheless say that if I had followed this wise counsel -- as<br/>someone who should appreciate the value of going to primary sources --<br/>I could have communicated my message of friendship while also offering<br/>an example of better judgement.</p><p>Evidently you sensed my own mixed feelings on this in my earlier<br/>article, and I&apos;m pleased to say that we&apos;re in total agreement. Reading<br/>my first post over again, I realize that I could have said everything<br/>that I wanted to while affirming the importance of not judging a book<br/>or journal article by its cover -- or by secondhand reviews, whatever<br/>their merits.</p><p>Now for the humorous story. Last week, I went to the library and less<br/>than flawlessly did a search for &quot;Perspectives _in_ New Music,&quot;<br/>concluding that they didn&apos;t subscribe, and so it might be awhile<br/>before I could get and read your article.</p><p>This week, however, I tried again with the correct &quot;Perspectives _of_<br/>New Music_ -- and yesterday found the issue with your article right<br/>there on the shelf, waiting to be read.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ll address three quick points, warmly inviting further<br/>dialogue on or off the list.</p><p>First, I consider the article an eloquent statement of your approach<br/>to composition, and of the process of reasoning and selection of<br/>materials which has brought you to where you are, with some<br/>fascinating analysis of the music of Joe Manieri -- I loved that story<br/>of the piece inspired by a medieval author also named Manieri from a<br/>different part of the world!</p><p>Secondly, I realized something which neatly fits in with an<br/>observation you make in one of your responses I saw today: your<br/>remarks aren&apos;t intended to apply to &quot;pre-equal-temperament&quot; musics of<br/>Western Europe, or to other world musics based on a range of tuning<br/>systems.</p><p>This may explain why, as someone who follows traditions of early<br/>European music, I find that the kinds of categories that you discuss<br/>might not really map my conceptual world of musicmaking and tunings<br/>very closely.</p><p>We can discuss this more, and I hope that such a dialogue might at<br/>once promote friendship and understanding, and promote a richer<br/>appreciation of the kind of pluralism to which we can all contribute<br/>in our own special ways.</p><p>Finally, both your article and that by Bill Alves in the same issue<br/>reminded me that my approach to counterpoint and consonance/dissonance<br/>could give me a very different outlook on categorizing tunings than<br/>someone coming from another kind of outlook might have.</p><p>There is much more to say about your article, but first I should get<br/>some rest and take a bit of time to consider how best to communicate<br/>my excitement.</p><p>Thank you for staying with this dialogue, for so graciously responding<br/>to my earlier post, and for understanding my friendly intentions.</p><p>Simply by writing your article, you have already given me a precious<br/>gift to enrich my musicmaking. Any opportunity to &quot;compare notes&quot; with<br/>you, in this forum or elsewhere, would be an extra delight -- not a<br/>&quot;debate,&quot; but a kind of celebration of parallels and divergences, in<br/>which some surprising common ground might emerge.</p><p>Thank you again for your patience, understanding, and generosity in<br/>adding some important conceptual pitches to the gamut of our list.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=37369 href="#37369">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2002 12:53:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

I feel almost spoiled by your letter.</p><p>I am happy if my essay can be this thought-provoking, whether it prompts readers<br/>to consider this very different side of microtonality or to reaffirm their belief in<br/>their chosen path (e.g. just intonation and other pure tuning methods).</p><p>Here&apos;s to more &quot;comparing of notes.&quot;</p><p>-Julie</p></div>
