I do have a<br/>&gt; different view, in  some regards.</p><p>Hi</p><p>thanks for the reply.</p><p>Unfortunately I can&apos;t help disagreeing  in several of your points,<br/>because the source situation is different but clear, or the<br/>evidence points into other direction.</p><p>I hope you don&apos;t mind my correcting you. I would however like to<br/>know, where your data come from.</p><p>&gt; Arp Schnitger built organs in Hamburg, Magdeburg, and<br/>&gt; throughout Friesland...</p><p>(And other regions,<br/>see <a href="http://www.arpschnitger.nl/schnit.html">http://www.arpschnitger.nl/schnit.html</a> )</p><p>your later statement that AS did not built in the Netherlands,<br/>would point to  that you couldn&apos;t mean the Dutch province Friesland?<br/>AS however built there organs in Leeuwaarden, Ferwerd and Sneek.</p><p>If you mean my home region Ostfriesland, which often falsely is<br/>called Friesland (s. below), it is Germany, neighbouring the<br/>related Dutch province of Groningen, where AS built ca. 30 organs.</p><p>However, in Ostfriesland AS built only four organs incl. the<br/>famous still existing (restored) in my hometown Norden.</p><p>&gt; but not in Dutch-speaking Nederland.</p><p>Additional to the organs he built in the Netherlands we can count<br/>one (at least) house organ: that went to the core of the<br/>Netherlands: Den Haag.</p><p>So including house organs and minor repair work we deal with bunch<br/>of 30 AS-organs in the Netherlands, of which about ten are<br/>preserved in different state of preservation.</p><p>&gt; Dutch-speaking Nederland is clear to me as a bastion of<br/>&gt; quarter-comma meantone,</p><p>in organs yes, until ca. 1760 - ca. 1850, and the same is true<br/>basically for Northern Germany (defined here very much as the<br/>German speaking region which AS worked in or at least delivered<br/>instruments, to - marked by the line from Flensburg, (Dargun),<br/>Stettin, Berlin, (Hagelberg, Magdeburg), Clausthal-Zellerfeld,<br/>Leer, Norden, Pellworm and back Flensburg).</p><p>Sideremark: Since we talk about Northern Germany, we skip here<br/>AS&apos;s deliveries to Moscow, Spain, Portugal and England,  and<br/>offers he was asked for, but did not get the job, like Sweden,<br/>Uppsala, Cathedral)</p><p>&gt; which would be fine for</p><p>Frans ...<br/>&gt; Caspar Schnitger.</p><p>Yes,<br/>I think too, it would be FCS&apos;s way to work meantone and now I can<br/>prove it, after organology had rejected this idea for  FCS and the<br/>Alkmaar organ. Actually this organ was one of the keystones in the<br/>long and wrongly prevailing assumtion that AS and FCs might have<br/>used well-temperaments or even ET.</p><p>&gt; Split-keyed quarter-comma meantone is &quot;Werckmeister II,&quot;<br/>&gt; described by Werckmeister as an incorrect approach.<br/>&gt; The Hamburg St. Jacobi Church was reputed to be built by Arp</p><p>yes<br/>the large rebuilt, in which AS took over lots of older pipe work,<br/>was finished in 1693</p><p>&gt; and it was tuned to equal temperament (read<br/>&gt; well-temperament, and likely Werckmeister III).</p><p>No,<br/>not by AS, who tuned it to meantone.  This was found in preserved<br/>original pipe lengths during the last restoration.<br/>Then we have two different descriptions of the temperaments in<br/>Hamburg organs from 1729 and 1731. As the later publication shows<br/>both the authors were not respectfully to each othe. But their<br/>statement on the Hamburg organ&apos;s temperaments is unanimous.</p><p>Btw, watch out:  the authors in the regions concerned, from<br/>Werckmeister onwards (may be before already?) do not mix up<br/>well-temperaments and ET! The are clear and well aware about this<br/>point!</p><p>&gt;  Remember Bach auditioned for Reinkein here.</p><p>No,<br/>that was not an audition, but Bach&apos;s improvisation(!) during a<br/>meeting with Reincken at St. Katharinen, the old organ, rebuild by<br/>Besser in the 1670ies.  Reincken however, never let AS touch his<br/>Besser-organ. From the large Hamburg organs in the four main<br/>churches, it was the only one not worked on by AS!</p><p>However Bach played an audition in St. Jakobi to apply for the<br/>organist position. And that organ was meantone, too, as said<br/>before and also in 1729 and 1731.<br/>Schnitger&apos;s meantone masterpiece was certainly not retuned extra<br/>for Bach - and then to be tuned back, so that the later reports<br/>and findings in the organ itself could fit. that would have easily<br/> meant more than 1 1/2 years work:  As account books from<br/>Northern Germany show, actual tuning was a heck of a job, in<br/>organs that large (50-65 stops) it could easily take 100-180<br/>working days - an that by famous and professional builders!</p><p>&gt; As there was no &quot;equal temperament&quot; in the day, that church</p><p>organ</p><p>&gt; is today in Werckmeister III.</p><p>No, it is in a &quot;modified&quot; meantone temperament based on 1/5-pyth.<br/>comma-fifths.</p><p>&gt; Yes, as to friends, I agree that we hold different standards,<br/>&gt; as people are wont to do. Writing a poem to Werckmeister<br/>&gt; takes a bit of a focus on a person that would lead me to<br/>&gt; suspect a &quot;friendship.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Your article</p><p>My abstract? Yes, you&apos;re right - for the purpose of that Artikel,<br/>which did not have to struggle with Werckmeister I could leave him<br/>out.<br/>However, as soon as Schnitger and Werckmeister are mentioned<br/>together the link to Buxtehude will be drawn. All three had some<br/>contacts - the strongest link can be established between Buxtehude<br/>and Schnitger. But, as I showed or will show here - and later in<br/>my diss. these links are all very shiny, one ore two bits of<br/>information unrelated to temperament issues, but all have been<br/>used in the past to propose Werckmeister (especially W. III) as<br/>&quot;the&quot; best choice for Buxtehude. That Werckmeister differntiated<br/>his temperaments according to the modes - recommending a<br/>third-comma temperament for the ordinary ones, the W III<br/>(quarter-comma based) for the remote modes, has been elegantly<br/>overlooked in the Buxtehude-discussion. Not to speak how this W.&apos;s<br/>splits (spagat) could be carried out in an organ: Werckmeister<br/>doesn&apos;t solve that riddle!</p><p>&gt; does not mention Buxtehude, really.  And yet,<br/>&gt; his music in Werckmeister III tuning fits like a glove.</p><p>I really appreciate your personal preference for Werckmeister and<br/>I think at least sometimes it might be a good choice for modern<br/>performance of Buxtehude&apos;s &quot;organ works&quot;.</p><p>But Werckmeister himself admitted that he was unsuccesful in transmitting his ideas to the organ builders practice!<br/>He complains about the stubborn organ builders and does not<br/>mention anyone of his famous colleagues (friends or not) who<br/>supports his temperament-ideas.<br/>No substantiated claim of a &quot;temperament link&quot; between those<br/>persons can be made, except of the poor chronological overlap,<br/>that they lived at the same time, and might have exchanged some<br/>letters of unknown content.</p><p>Our personal preference for the one or other temperament neither<br/>proves nor disproves anything about the actual status of the organ.</p><p>We should try to avoid judging the organs from music which can&apos;t<br/>be even shown that it was performed (see. my poll from last week<br/>and try to find an answer for that).<br/>Of none single of Buxtehude&apos;s or one of the other North German<br/>organ composer&apos;s &quot;organ music&quot; any exact performance data are<br/>known (place, time, instrument) are known, from which a careful<br/>and very cautious clue might be drawn, pointing to the status of<br/>an organ - and in terms of temperaments always our personal<br/>preferences might be in the way.</p><p>&gt;  And history does consider his W&apos;s friend.</p><p>No,<br/>only modern conclusions from this poem, and a third-hand report<br/>that they exchanged letters (how many, over what period?). Not<br/>very much, that confirms that they shared much more than a few<br/>common opinions, and not necessarily about temperament.</p><p>On the contrary I think that Buxtehude was well aware of the needs<br/>and function of an organ. An organ was no private experimental<br/>site for a theorist, who admittedly was unsuccesful in promoting<br/>his ideas,  and a composer inspired by new ideas. The organ was<br/>instead a tool used in a public situation and its status and<br/>enormous costs (building and(or maintenance) paid and supervised<br/>by the churchly structures. It playyed its role within in a rather<br/>strictly ruled liturgical and social function, in the service,<br/>with congregation, and in the interplay with ensemble music.</p><p>Even if Buxtehude would have subscribed to Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>temperament ideas, and finally would have convinced his parish<br/>council of the urgent need to complete retune two  40+ and 50+<br/>instruments (together ca. 100 stops, including the old facade<br/>32-pipes from 1516-18) and found an organ builder, who would and<br/>could do that kind of unprecedented experiment? And why did that<br/>escape Mattheson and (H&auml;ndel) who visited Buxtehude (Mattheson<br/>wrote countless pages, incl. loads about temperament etc.)?</p><p>Why does  neither Werckmeister himself point to this in his<br/>several publications, in which he defends his ideas  - nor one of<br/>the many people in Northern Germany (Hamburg) which asked until<br/>much later (after B.s death in 1707) for the invention of<br/>well-temperaments or equal temperament, with frequent general<br/>statements that &quot;organs don&apos;t have&quot; such &quot;nw&quot; temperaments.  And<br/>Werckmeister himself calls the meantone temperament the &apos;common<br/>temperament&apos; also the &apos;old temperament&apos; (the latter of course to<br/>market his ideas as new).<br/>And finally, such substantial retuning-work is not documented?<br/>Only touch-ups of maximum ca. 4-5 weeks (in both organs together)<br/>at several times (and already in unsuspicious clear menatone time).<br/>No, nothing indicates, that Buxtehude was in favor of other than<br/>meantone temperament *in organs*.  And when he visited Schnitger&apos;s<br/>brandnew meantone organ in Nikolai Hamburg, 1687, he obviously<br/>didn&apos;t object. On the contrary years later he asked Schnitger to<br/>come and work on an offer for an &apos;update&apos; of &apos;B.&apos;s&apos; large organ in<br/>St. Marien in L&uuml;beck. That didn&apos;t happen for unclear reasons and<br/>O. D. Richborn, Schnitger&apos;s concurrent in Hamburg did the job.</p><p>&gt; W had spent some time in Lubeck.</p><p>No!<br/>There is neither one single source for a visit of Werckmeister in<br/>L&uuml;beck,  nor a direct source nor second-hand (or may be you can<br/>provide an until now unknown source?). And the (unknown and<br/>unsupported) visit, of whichs possible content we could speculate<br/>ad infinitum  would not mean that the organs in L&uuml;beck St. Marien<br/>would have been retuned afterwards.  And finally the organs were<br/>usually played together with instruments in the sunday services<br/>and the Abendmusiken: The accompanied instruments include<br/>woodwinds (for example 16&apos;-bombard) which could not be easily<br/>adapted to a new temperament (and if the tuning work was not<br/>extremely exact, to a newer pitch, mostly raised), because the<br/>holes are exactly drilled, according to pitch and temperament.<br/>The account books, thousands of pages, which I have gone through,<br/>do not support substantial purchases of new instruments or<br/>changes.  A few expenses every  now and then on repairing a<br/>*damage of an instrument. 2-3 times a new  instrument including<br/>strung instruments. That&apos;s about the amount: nothing indicating a<br/>change.</p><p>&gt; And then there is Groningen</p><p>Do you mean St. Martini (finished 1692)?  Schnitger re/built some<br/>larger organs in this town - btw, in the Netherlands - which still<br/>today has a bunch of his output (Martini, Aa-kerk,<br/>Pelstergasthuiskerk)!</p><p>&gt; which was tuned to WIII in 1705.</p><p>Neither Groningen-Martini,<br/>as the pre-restoration report from Cor Edskes 1972 stated that<br/>the research on Schnitgers (and the older) pipework in St, Martini<br/> lead to the conclusion, that the organ was meantone in 1692,<br/>when Schnitger finished the rebuilt. This agrees to all other<br/>reports about Arp Schnitger&apos;s tuning/temperament practice.<br/>Edskes also states firmly, that nothing points to any temperament<br/>change in Groningen Martini until 1854.</p><p>This would not be a very seldom case. Schnitger&apos;s largest organ in<br/>Hamburg St. Nikolai, finished 1687, was according to Fock&apos;s<br/>research never worked on again (minor touch ups), until it burnt<br/>in the fire, which destroyed greater parts of the old city in 1842<br/>- it probably burnt down unchanged in meantone!</p><p>Nor Groningen Pelstergasthuiskerk,<br/>which today has a &quot;transition&quot;-temperament between a modified<br/>meantoe and a well-temperament.</p><p>About the temperament of the other organs in the twon of<br/>Groningen, indications are lacking.</p><p>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Best</p><p>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>A sideremark to &quot;Friesland&quot;, for those who have good maps.</p><p>Friesland is best understood as the Dutch Province of Friesland.<br/>As &quot;Ostfriese&quot;, not &quot;Friese&quot;, I&apos;d like to confuse everyone even<br/>more with some facts.</p><p>From West to east the most important &quot;Frieslands&quot; are:</p><p>1) (Dutch) West-Friesland (a small area on the peninsula north<br/>   of Amsterdam)</p><p>It is geographical disconnect by the former North Sea bay (once<br/>Zuiderzee), now a sort of salt water lake Ijsselmeer<br/>from</p><p>2) (Dutch) FRIESLAND or Provinsje Frysl&acirc;n - Dutch province<br/>    <a href="http://www.fryslan.nl/">http://www.fryslan.nl/</a><br/>   (in German we call it not quite correct West-Friesland)<br/>   capital: Leeuwaarden/Ljouwert.<br/>   Bilingual:  official documents are written in Dutch<br/>               and Frisian (many relations to [old] English)</p><p>It is geographical disconnect by the whole Dutch Province of<br/>Groningen from</p><p>3) (German) Ostfriesland<br/>    main cities: Aurich, Emden, Leer, Norden, Wittmund<br/>    local language: local dialect of Low German (with very<br/>                    few rests of the old Frisian)<br/>    At home we used to say that south of Leer and east of<br/>    Wittmund, &quot;Germany&quot; begins.<br/>    Southeast of Leer, already surrounded by &quot;German&quot; ground<br/>    is a small enclave of 1500 people still speaking a Frisian<br/>    dialect (while<br/>It is adjacing the<br/>4) (German District) of &quot;Friesland&quot; - which is just a political<br/>    name<br/>    main city: Jever (yes, the famous beer! pronunciation like<br/>    &quot;yafer&quot; not &quot;yaver&quot; as even some south Germans do ...)<br/>    language: local dialect of Low German<br/>    They belonged once to Russia (under Katarina &apos;the great&apos;), but<br/>    you know, as long as their beer is so good ...</p><p>It is geographical disconnect by the North Sea (German bay) by<br/>road ca. 400-500 km North east (across the North sea just 150 km) from</p><p>5) (German)Nord-Friesland,.<br/>    Cities: Husum, Westerland<br/>    Language: Local variant of Frisian (partly mixed with<br/>              local dialects of Low<br/>    German)</p><p>These are the socio-lingual-cultural-political regions.<br/>And the geographical ...</p><p>For example:<br/>The socio-cultural entity Ostfriesland (&quot;Eastern Friesland&quot;) is<br/>the (larger) western part of the whole peninsula whichs<br/>geographical name is also &quot;Ostfriesland&quot;.
