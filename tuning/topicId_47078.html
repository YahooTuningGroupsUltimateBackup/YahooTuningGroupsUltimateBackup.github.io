Like for instance, I believe the beautiful and hypnotic sounds of Indian ragas use Just intonation and minor keys too, and also lots of overtones. I wish someone would tell me how to compose Just intonation midis which could be converted to mp3s. I&apos;d need to do this at the public library because I have even less money than you!! I really hope to enter this community because I have some very important information and composing techniques.<br/>    Of course I respect everyone&apos;s views here in tuning. And I hope your music sounds like you dream, and we get to hear it too!!!!!!    ,,,,later</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
