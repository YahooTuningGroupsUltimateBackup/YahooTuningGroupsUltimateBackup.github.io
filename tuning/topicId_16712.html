If you play clearly, the tracking is not that bad.<br/>Sometimes it can be kind<br/>of funky, when you set it to play any microtonal note, but it&apos;s minimal<br/>as long as you adjust<br/>to it&apos;s feel.</p><p>It should play your micro fretted notes fine because it&apos;s tracking any<br/>note within a 100<br/>cents. There should be no slide from note to note. When I play within a<br/>half step or a non et<br/>interval, there&apos;s no sliding unless I purposely slide. This is with a<br/>fretless and I assume it<br/>should treat your guitar the same, since it treats bends on ET guitars<br/>to non bended notes<br/>without a slide. You could always double check by playing it at a store.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>Al</p><p><a href="mailto:ligonj@northstate.net">ligonj@northstate.net</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Al,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wanted to thank you for opening my eyes to this information about<br/>&gt; the pitch bend working with the GK-2 and synthesizer. I would like to<br/>&gt; ask how quickly it will track to the correct pitch across the neck,<br/>&gt; and especially on low notes, where I heard is where the GK-2 works a<br/>&gt; little more slowly. I&apos;ve kept up with the development of guitar<br/>&gt; synths and the GK-2 is supposed to track after sensing 1/2 of a cycle<br/>&gt; from the string.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there any sliding/glissing/portamento of the notes as the synth<br/>&gt; trys to track the results of playing on a microtonally fretted neck?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is looking more and more feasible for me, and I appreciate you<br/>&gt; giving me yet another part of the puzzle!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best Regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, alfredo giusto &lt;agiusto@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Jacky,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The GK2 pickup will work with microtonal tunings if your synth. has<br/>&gt; the capability. For ex, I<br/>&gt; &gt; have a Roland JV-1080 and I put a fretless guitar though it with<br/>&gt; the GK pickup and I can play<br/>&gt; &gt; any microtonal interval. You have to set the bend range from -12 to<br/>&gt; +12. That even ables you<br/>&gt; &gt; to play bends on normal 12 et guitars. You also have to set the<br/>&gt; interface (Roland GI-10) to<br/>&gt; &gt; the same bend range. The equipment might have changed a bit since I<br/>&gt; got mine, but the concept<br/>&gt; &gt; is the same.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, I have a Chapman Stick. I&apos;ve been thinking about refretting<br/>&gt; it. Let me know what you<br/>&gt; &gt; find out.
