Would you stuff it in a box or wear<br/>it on your head?</p><p>&gt; [from the ages of 15 (when i started guitar) to 21 i was particularly<br/>&gt; concerned with playing fast, and sat there practicing (a rather<br/>&gt; limited set of techniques) with a metronome until i could match steve<br/>&gt; vai (i even had the same model guitar, which as you know is now<br/>&gt; refretted for 22-equal). since then, i haven&apos;t been particularly<br/>&gt; concerned with playing fast,</p><p>Can you ripp around in 22tet? I still can&apos;t get around real quick<br/>on the 63-tone JI guitar,  but this was never my goal, I tend to be much<br/>more flexable on the fretless. I can try out other tunings too. A big plus.</p><p>&gt;though when i&apos;m in a certain mood and<br/>&gt; nice and warmed up, that&apos;s often how i do play. if you want to hear<br/>&gt; some sickly fast guitar though, listen to buckethead!]</p><p>As a big Bill Laswell fan, I&apos;m somewhat familiar with Buckethead.<br/>As I recall, he&apos;s very linear.</p><p>I never really had speed. When I was 21 or 22 I had a cyst<br/>removed from the top of my left hand and I&apos;ve never been<br/>the same. By 30-32, I was again having problems with the<br/>same hand, so I had to stop for a few years. (Sorry to be a downer<br/>folks, I&apos;m leading up to a point) But that isn&apos;t the real reason I got<br/>into minimalism. Even when I was learning Jazz and checking out<br/>Post-Classical/Classical, I was still listening to all that classic Fripp,<br/>Eno,<br/>Budd, Hassell, Terry Riley and La Monte Young. At the time, I didn&apos;t<br/>realise all this would be such a big influence.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been wowing &apos;em from coast to coast this Spring by playing<br/>&gt; &gt;really slow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that&apos;s excellent, and leads me into something i was planning to ask<br/>&gt; julia, which was whether minimalism could be considered western<br/>&gt; music. instead, i&apos;ll wait until i read her pnm article . . .</p><p>I had a flip comment here, but it&apos;s such a good title I have to keep it to<br/>myself.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div><h3><a id=37707 href="#37707">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2002 12:28:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David Beardsley &lt;davidbeardsley@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is it bigger than a bread box?
