That&apos;s it!!! I grew up in Detroit. No wonder my ear is fixated<br/>&gt;&gt;on the 7:9 third. Evidently, I was startled at a young age hearing a Chevy<br/>&gt;&gt;horn in one ear and a large truck blasting a 2:3 in the other. It really had<br/>&gt;&gt;nothing to do with my high school choral teacher warming up the group<br/>&gt;&gt;building major triads a cappella. Besides, all those other kids in the choir<br/>&gt;&gt;grew up in the Detroit area and were likely similarly infected. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Jerry,</p><p>To which John LInk commented:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re joking or serious or both (probably both).</p><p>Good conclusion, John, but mostly not. The question is: which came<br/>first--the car horn or the high school warmups?  ;-)  (It&apos;s difficult to<br/>communicate the &quot;tone of voice&quot; in writing, but the little icons developed<br/>for internet conversation do a pretty good job.)</p><p>I&apos;ve done<br/>&gt;some more experimenting with my guitar and found that although 9/7 makes an<br/>&gt;interesting major third in a triad, it doesn&apos;t do the job in a major 7th<br/>&gt;chord. If the 7th is 3/2 relative to the major third, then the 7th is 27/14<br/>&gt;relative to the root, implying the small interval of 28/27 between the<br/>&gt;upper octave of the root and the 7th. The chord 14:18:21:27 sounds<br/>&gt;terrible, with none of the beauty of 8:10:12:15.</p><p>I&apos;ve downloaded a sound analyser that I didn&apos;t have time to get into before<br/>leaving for this little out of town getaway. When I get home next week I&apos;ll<br/>break it open and perhaps I will be better able to respond meaningfully to<br/>your (and other&apos;s) mathematical descriptions of &quot;what works.&quot;</p><p>&gt;By any chance does the CD that comes with your book &quot;The Sounds of Music:<br/>&gt;Perception and Notation&quot; have any major thirds on it?</p><p>Yes it does, however some of the critical illustrations originally recorded<br/>in analogue were not to my liking and I redid them hurriedly (to make<br/>deadline) using a keyboard limited to 100 cents per semitone. There are some<br/>vocal examples that were recorded &quot;live,&quot; but I don&apos;t have a copy here on<br/>the road so I can&apos;t be specific.</p><p>I have found cents inadequate to express accurate tuning as experienced by<br/>sensitive singers. Apparently, the precise adjustments we hear<br/>&quot;acoustically&quot; fall in &quot;the cracks&quot; between the &quot;clicks&quot; from one cent to<br/>the next (contrary to articles in the Harvard Dictionary of Music). Needless<br/>to say, I am anxious to redo the CD with well tuned live recordings. I&apos;m<br/>also anxious to redo many of the tuning sections to reflect the valuable<br/>info I have received thus far from the Tuning List.</p><p>Got to run now. It&apos;s almost time for my Palm Springs tee off. (New Yorkers,<br/>eat your heart out.)</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
