And to illustrate the problem in<br/>front of us all in pursuance of this topic, when a singer deviates &quot;+-<br/>5 cents&quot; whilst singing a 3/2 or 2/1 in a harmony, what do you get?<br/>Beats showering down like raindrops in a hurricane! Although with<br/>thirds (or other intervals, according to the chord voicing) this<br/>might be less perceptible.</p><p>This prompts the further question of; To what subjective (audible<br/>quality) or mathematical degree will we allow the rapidity of beats<br/>to determine or disqualify the &quot;justness&quot; of a chord&apos;s intoning?<br/>Obviously there is a point at which an interval would be distuned<br/>sharp or flat, when it would begin to slowly beat, and as it&apos;s tuned<br/>further away, more defined and rapid beating is perceived. To<br/>clarify: If certain chord tones are slightly distuned to where there<br/>is only very slow beating, would we not generally tend to perceive<br/>this as also being justly intoned? Especially if one were to hear it<br/>without having first tuned the interval themselves. Would this slight<br/>phasing make any difference in qualifying a chord as being justly<br/>intoned? Perhaps there is a larger average tolerance of deviation for<br/>the perception of justness, than the stated &quot;&quot;within +-0.5 cents&quot; of<br/>Just Intonation&quot;&quot;, dependent upon the timbres under consideration. My<br/>experience is that the human voice has the wonderful quality of<br/>somewhat masking these kinds of deviations, likely because it&apos;s such<br/>a &quot;continuously variable&quot; sort of sound and its harmonic structure.</p><p>I&apos;m sure these are constant considerations in your adaptive work<br/>(btw, I really enjoyed your recent midi files, which played<br/>wonderfully on my system - preferring the 7 limit versions.).</p><p>To answer your question, in light of the Keenanian/OED definition,<br/>being an audible quality, likely it would be construed as &quot;true<br/>JI&quot;.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=16549 href="#16549">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2000 5:58:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Jacky, I think you misinterpreted what was being said.
