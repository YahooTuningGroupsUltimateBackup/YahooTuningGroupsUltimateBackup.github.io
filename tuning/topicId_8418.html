I&apos;ve been working to smooth my adaptive<br/>(and now, fixed-tuning) techniques for the benefit of ears easily<br/>irritated by motion (and, as I hope I&apos;ve made clear, I&apos;m VERY grateful<br/>for the feedback that is so vital in helping me refine my methods!).</p><p>This week the other side speaks.  John Starrett, Joseph Pehrson, Jay<br/>Williams, Kami Rousseau, Carl Lumma, and others are saying you prefer<br/>the &quot;jumpier&quot; tunings from the work I did in the last century :-).</p><p>For the most part, I&apos;m right there with the jumpy set.  I do find that<br/>my ear needs relief, though, as may be had by a restful run-through of a<br/>suitable piece in fixed tuning, such as the Bach/Busoni we&apos;ve discussed<br/>lately.</p><p>The new &quot;spring&quot; model is built overtop the old methods, and the program<br/>still has an option to bypass springs altogether.  I think, however,<br/>that some touch of spring work is helpful, for example in dealing with<br/>drift in a more consistent manner, looking forward and backward in time.</p><p>What I need to do is take Paul E&apos;s suggestion and hurry up making<br/>changes that will allow essentially infinitely stiff vertical springs,<br/>preserving exact vertical JI, while using the springs for optimum drift<br/>response.  That&apos;ll help flesh out a more complete range of tuning<br/>possibilities.  I don&apos;t think jumpiness will &quot;suffer&quot; much because of<br/>that bit of horizontal spring relaxation: it&apos;s guaranteed in the tuning<br/>shifts made necessary by the sequence.  Of course, 7-limit will always<br/>be jumpier than 5-limit, other things being equal.</p><p>As always, thanks SO much to every one, smooth and jumpy, for your<br/>feedback.  Because of it, I&apos;ve made more progress in the last year than<br/>I did in seven years&apos; solo work before finding kindred souls on the<br/>tuning list.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=8453 href="#8453">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
