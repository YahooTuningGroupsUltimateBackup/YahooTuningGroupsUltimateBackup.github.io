The first function would create bridges<br/>between different musical sources. The second would start<br/>emphasising the statistically unusual aspects rather than usual.<br/>This type of tool is easy to build and generated some interesting<br/>mslodies.</p><p>The problem with that tool is that a query has to find an exact match<br/>to get a result. For instance, a Bach database, faced with 12 notes<br/>from Webern would not generate an &apos;answer statement&apos; along the lines of<br/>how Back woudl finish those notes.</p><p>Neural Networks have no such limitations. Unfortunately, the ones<br/>I worked with got into loops too easilly.</p><p>Just some thoughts and no, I lost the source code.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
