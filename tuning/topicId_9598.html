Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2000 3:56:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Keenan Pepper,</p><p>The main reason your metric doesn&apos;t &quot;work&quot; for me is that it assigns the<br/>same distance for 15/8 as for 5/3. 5/3 is much more consonant than 15/8 and<br/>thus should receive a shorter distance. The triangular lattice you see a lot<br/>of on this list is more appropriate than the rectangular lattice you suggest<br/>for this reason.</p><p>Partch diamonds and Wilson CPS scales are the most &quot;compact&quot; structures on<br/>this triangular lattice and its higher-dimensional analogues.</p><p>Alternatively, if you are willing to allow octave specificity, you could<br/>stick to the rectangular lattice but be sure to retain all powers of two,<br/>not excluding them the way you did. Then 15/8 would come out as longer than<br/>5/3 since the former involves a move of 3 steps along the 2-axis while the<br/>latter involves a move of no steps along the 2-axis.</p><p>I&apos;d also ask you to consider carefully whether a city-block metric (one is<br/>restriced to move along the lines of the lattice, no &quot;shortcuts&quot; allowed) is<br/>not in fact a more appropriate measure than the Euclidean metric you&apos;re<br/>using.</p><p>Finally, I&apos;d suggest that the log of n, rather than n, should be the length<br/>of each rung along the n-axis. As evidence, I believe that ratios of 9 are<br/>more dissonant than ratios of 7, etc.</p><p>If you agree with my suggestions and go the rectangular, octave-specific<br/>route, you&apos;ll be using Tenney&apos;s Harmonic Distance function. If you prefer<br/>octave-specificity, you&apos;ll want to look in the archives at the discussions<br/>between Paul Hahn, Carl Lumma, and myself on triangular lattice metrics.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
