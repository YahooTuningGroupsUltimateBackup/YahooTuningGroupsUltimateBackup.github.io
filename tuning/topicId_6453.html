I&apos;ve heard the<br/>&gt;&quot;ideal slendro&quot; argument put forward since I started playing the music, but<br/>&gt;I have to confess that I&apos;ve never been aware of its source.  I&apos;d be<br/>&gt;grateful for any clues as to the origin of this.  As for the systems<br/>&gt;proposed/described by Andrew Timar and others, they sound interesting and<br/>&gt;possibly revealing as avenues of after-the-fact investigation (i.e., to see<br/>&gt;how they _differ_ from gamelan tuning in practice).  But given the rarity<br/>&gt;and artificiality of equal-tempered systems in the world (even in western<br/>&gt;classical music!!), I don&apos;t understand why one would expect them to reveal<br/>&gt;anything about the history or practice of gamelan tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To evoke Lou Harrison yet again, his Music Primer has a nice section in<br/>&gt;which he talks about first attempts to build a just intonation slendro.  I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t have the book in front of me, but if I recall the upshot was a<br/>&gt;nice-sounding scale that didn&apos;t really &quot;fool the experts,&quot; as it were, but<br/>&gt;which he still found useful in his own work.  This of course brings up the<br/>&gt;complex and problematic relationship between gamelan and the overtone<br/>&gt;series, something addressed in these discussions in numerous interesting<br/>&gt;ways.  I would seem natural for western ethnomusicologists to do this,<br/>&gt;given that pretty much all Eurasian tuning systems, from Tuva to western<br/>&gt;harmony, are based on lower partials.  So I&apos;m wondering - probably naively<br/>&gt;-  if anyone else has seriously considered the possibility that slendro<br/>&gt;and/or pelog might have some connection to lower partials, and, if so, what<br/>&gt;it might be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I ask because there is a pretty obvious albeit somewhat tangential<br/>&gt;relationship between Balinese slendro and the overtone series in gamelan<br/>&gt;genggong.  Here 4-note &quot;angklung&quot; melodies (this scale being a partial<br/>&gt;slendro) are played on suling and doubled by the genggong jaw-harps, which<br/>&gt;of course can only generate overtones from a single fundamental.  The match<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t exact but it&apos;s as close as it ever is with Balinese suling.  A<br/>&gt;reasonable &apos;saih gender wayang&apos; can be made using partials 5-6-7-8-9 with<br/>&gt;the fundamental (that is, partial 8) corresponding to &quot;deng&quot; (second lowest<br/>&gt;pitch) on a Balinese gender wayang.  Obviously, no set of genders I&apos;ve ever<br/>&gt;heard has actually matches this, nor do those measured by McPhee, but it<br/>&gt;does generate something close to many genders I&apos;ve heard, as well as<br/>&gt;representing some kind of intervallic &quot;limit&quot; for Balinese slendro (i.e.,<br/>&gt;it&apos;s hard to find intervals larger than 6:5 or smaller than 10:9).  It also<br/>&gt;represents a model within the culture (in the sense that the genggongs are<br/>&gt;a part of Balinese music) for a 5-tone anhemitonic scale that&apos;s neither<br/>&gt;equidistant nor based on overblown fifths.  I&apos;m not suggesting any strong<br/>&gt;or necessary link, but the fact is that, in practice, suling melodies are<br/>&gt;played in &quot;functional unison&quot; with these kind of just intervals.  And it<br/>&gt;seems to me that that does tell us _something_ about Balinese tuning<br/>&gt;systems, even if that&apos;s only to say that Balinese tuning is so flexible<br/>&gt;that it can accomodate a just-intonation slendro, along with many other<br/>&gt;possibilities.  Which would, ironically, then rule out both equal-tempered<br/>&gt;_and_ overtone-based models.  Which we sort of already knew...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m kind of a novice on these matters, so forgive any glaring errors or<br/>&gt;irrelevancies - just thought I&apos;d throw my two cents in...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Evan Ziporyn</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
