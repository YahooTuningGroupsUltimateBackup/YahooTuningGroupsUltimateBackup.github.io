Earlier Greek scales also had 3/4 tones -- the hemiolic<br/>chromatic of Aristoxenos where it was split (75 + 75 +350 cents) and the<br/>Spondeion, where it was not originally, according to Winnington-Ingram.</p><p>As for tuning variations in performance, David Rothenberg deals with<br/>these points under the names &quot;range&quot; and &quot;blur,&quot; as well as &quot;proper<br/>modification.&quot; The range is the extent to which any one tone can vary<br/>without destroying the propriety of the scale, the blur to which they<br/>all can. Rothenberg also deals with the range of variation that<br/>preserves &quot;equivalence&quot; class and with those that are perceptible to to<br/>a given listener (for example, one who can ignore comma sized<br/>deviations). However the math is somewhat difficult. See the microtonal<br/>bibliography for references.</p><p>I think it is clear that Chinese theorists had workable approximations<br/>to 12-tet before Europe. The earliest is about the 4th centure CE.<br/>Prince Tsai Yu computed the 12th roots of 2 accurately a few years<br/>before Simon Stevin and the other Europeans. So, 12-tet is not exactly<br/>the evil invention of dead white guys.</p><p>Whether Chinese music ever made much use of it and whether Japan got it<br/>from China or from Europe is unknown to me.</p><p>--John</p></div>
