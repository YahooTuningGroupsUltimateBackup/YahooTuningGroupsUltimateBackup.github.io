Equal tempered fifth<br/>are 700 cents (100 cents = 1 semitone in 12-tone equal).  The pure<br/>fifth in just intonation (also the basis for Pythagorean tuning), the<br/>third overtone in the overtone series which registerally transposes<br/>into an octave with the ratio 3:2, is 701.9 cents.  In most cases,<br/>the ear cannot distinguish anything smaller than 5 cents.</p><p>In Medieval times when Pythagorean tuning reigned supreme,<br/>parallel fifths were the rage.  They sound great!  After 12-tone equal-<br/>temperament became the de-facto keyboard tuning throughout<br/>Europe (circa 1850), parallel fifths were suddenly O.K. again.  (e.g.<br/>they sound great when Debussy uses them!)  Parallel mean-tone<br/>fifths sound awful because they call attention to the fact that the<br/>interval is out-of-tune by a teeny bit over 5 cents. (701.9 - 696 = 5.9<br/>cents)</p><p>Similarly, major thirds were considered dissonant intervals because<br/>they were based on cumulative perfect fifths (3:2) rather than the<br/>fifth partial of the overtone series.</p><p>(That is to say C to E was based on C-G-D-A-E, which registerally<br/>transposes into the octave as 81:64, rather than the registerally<br/>transposed fifth overtone which is 5:4.  The difference between<br/>these two &quot;major thirds&quot;, the syntonic comma (81:80) is almost an<br/>eighth of a tone and is very audible.</p><p>81:64 equals 407 cents</p><p>5:4 equals 386 cents</p><p>the major third in 12ET is somewhere in between at 400 cents)</p><p>Thirds didn&apos;t become O.K. until Pythagorean tuning was<br/>supplanted.  However, the just intonation of vocal music in the<br/>Renaissance didn&apos;t work for instrumental music (esp. keyboard<br/>music) which requires a limited set of pitches to draw from in order<br/>to be practical, hence the compromise of 1/4 comma mean-tone<br/>which preserved the pure major third (5:4) at the expense of the<br/>pure perfect fifth (3:2) by subtracting each perfect fifth (3:2) by 1/4<br/>of the syntonic comma (81:80) such that with</p><p>C-G-D-A-E</p><p>C-E equals 5:4 therefore each fifth (C-G, G-D, D-A and A-E) are<br/>downsized equally.</p><p>In the Baroque, parallel thirds are everythere and they sound great.<br/>But, no parallel fifths.</p><p>The evolution of temperament is the real reason for these<br/>counterpoint rules.</p><p>Hope this makes sense. . .</p><p>Frank J.

Keyboard tunings were not determining preferred harmony in the 14th<br/>through 17th centuries. Keyboard tunings were devised to match as closely<br/>as possible the ideals of harmony prevalent. Pythagorean -- perfect<br/>fifths. Meantone -- the tyranny of the perfect third. Much keyboard<br/>music exploited the excitements and tensions in meantone, but<br/>keyboard music was not the center of the musical world. I doubt that<br/>anybody much before the seventeenth century composed vocal music &apos;at<br/>the keyboard&apos;. Maybe with the discovery of circulating temperaments<br/>composers started looking for harmonic inspiration from what their<br/>harpsichord sounded like. By the nineteenth century, keyboards were so<br/>important that large numbers of people lost the ability to hear perfect<br/>intervals at all. But don&apos;t try to extrapolate that back too far.
