Actually I<br/>  &gt; don&apos;t really know what harmony means! (I&apos;d be so glad<br/>  &gt; if someone could explain but understand that might be<br/>  &gt; far too tedious for many of you.) With your analogy of<br/>  &gt; space moving, it feels to me like chord changes? When<br/>  &gt; you say &quot;there is a primary movement (the harmonic<br/>  &gt; context) and a secondary  one of the melody relative<br/>  &gt; to that context.&quot; is it that the primary one is a<br/>  &gt; chord which changes, or a drone perhaps or whatever.<br/>  &gt; Like a basic mood-space. Then the melody is a dynamic<br/>  &gt; &quot;dancer&quot;, a sequence of changing pitches enertaining<br/>  &gt; and ornamenting that space?<br/>  &gt; What about if 2 instruments play together, but with<br/>  &gt; equal dynamic character. Like, two oboes for example,<br/>  &gt; playing away. If they are not playing the same<br/>  &gt; sequence of notes, is that 2 melodies or a harmony? I<br/>  &gt; mean, if they are making sense with each other. At<br/>  &gt; what point is it called a harmony?</p><p>  Ah, well, things are indeed a little more complicated than they look<br/>  at first sight! The word &quot;harmony&quot; as such has a rather broad meaning<br/>  - the examples you give above can all fall into that - so, in this<br/>  sense, &quot;harmony&quot; is present in nearly all music...</p><p>  But to elaborate a little more on Ansermet&apos;s idea - drones are a good<br/>  keyword. Imagine a melody played over a drone - and then the same<br/>  melody played over a different drone. The perceptions will be quite<br/>  different, since the effect of a drone is to emphasize a kind of base<br/>  or reference tone - it is often the tone the melody starts or stops<br/>  on, so the melody will be heard relative to that base tone.<br/>  A single drone, however, is rather a non-moving space, so music with<br/>  just one drone would still be called, so to say, &quot;pre-copernican&quot;.<br/>  But imagine a piece where the drone changes in the middle - then the<br/>  reference tone changes: moving ground! Maybe the word &quot;modulation&quot; is<br/>  a good keyword that describes what I mean.<br/>  Which brings me to another point. On the website about maqam music you<br/>  posted here a whlie ago, I read that in maqam music there are<br/>  modulations, too - just not &quot;harmony&quot;, but, as far as I understand it,<br/>  between different kinds of melody. So far for the question about maqam<br/>  music and &quot;Dark Ages&quot;!<br/>  I am sorry I do not know much about maqams (nor did Ansermet, I<br/>  suppose) - but I am just imagining that the concept of modulation may<br/>  not always have been present in maqam music and entered at a certain<br/>  period of time - maybe Ozan can tell something here?<br/>  --<br/>  Hans Straub</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2005 4:57:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Justin, Ozan and all,</p><p>Some of the definitions I collected on Google searching on &quot;Harmony&quot;,<br/>are given below.

The fluent passages of J.S. Bach&apos;s music can hardly be thought of as &grave;vertical blocks&grave;. Even Handel, who is considered homophonic, was not this BLOKE-ish.</p><p>  *Harmony is the chordal or vertical structure of a piece of music, as opposed to melody (and polyphony, or multiple melodies) which<br/>  represents the horizontal structure.

I like the addition of the concept of &grave;compatibility&grave;. It implies that not all simultaenously sounding pitches can be thought of as harmonious. Yet the definition is lacking, since harmony is not just chord progressions in my view, but the aural phenomenon resulting from the perception of soothing or perplexing chord-like units during the flow of music.</p><p>  *In the most general sense, harmony refers to the types of chords used predominantly in a work, or the harmonic system (ie tonal or<br/>  otherwise) that is used in a composition. Harmony is also used to<br/>  refer to a specific chord or series of chords.</p><p>There is no mention of how these should be used, and when.</p><p>  *The way in which chords are arranged in a musical composition.</p><p>But how? &grave;compatibly arranged&grave; would have been a better term. And I would have preferred the concept &grave;chunks of simultaneously sounded rich, vibrant tones that resonate with their individual harmonic partials, pertaining to established rules of music theory, which are perceived as static chords within a favorable acoustic space&grave;.</p><p>  *The simultaneous combination of notes and the ensuing relationships of intervals and chords.

I would love to hear the possibilities!</p><p>That&apos;s the spirit! Harmoniousness of a music depends on the concordant fusion of timbre, scale, variations in pitch, dynamics, instrumental parts, beat and tempo. The possibilities are truly limitless. As for the character change... that&apos;s a tricky one! I have been working on Maqam Music polyphony without destroying its subtle character since two years now, but it requires great skill in maintaining a most sensitive pitch-timbre equilibrium. It&apos;s like a fragile antique china vase from the Ming dynasty! My knowledge of instrumentation is insufficient to produce a satisfactory result as yet. I don&apos;t believe many people have succeeded in this direction either. That is one reason why I am reluctant to compose anything for some time now. Lots of experimentation has to be done before I can even consider returning to composing.</p><p>  Is THAT what is missing from eastern music?

I don&apos;t think its missing, its just absent, awaiting to be unearthed in skillful hands.</p><p>  Sorry to ask, but what is microtonal music? Is it just<br/>  music which uses intervals smaller than 100cents?</p><p>Simply put, music that uses intervals smaller or larger than 100 cents or its multiples. Some also include 100 cents into the microtonal category. But generally, it is thought that microtonality is just any tuning that exists &grave;between the cracks of the piano keys&grave;.</p><p>  Would there be any reason why one would expect<br/>  microtonal music to NOT work with all those harmony<br/>  things?</p><p>Some here in Turkey say, that the elegant nuances of pitch dissapear with added parts for harmony, but I think its just a load of hogwash.

Polyphonic thinking preceded harmonic thinking and was only concerned with interval relationships between melodies: consonances are allowed anytime, but dissonances have to introduced and resolved in specific ways. The consonances are the thirds and sixths, the unison and the fifth plus their octave replacements. The fourth is accepted between inner parts, but is a dissonance above the bass. Since the fifth and sixth are a second apart forming a dissonance, at most three different notes can sound together and still be consonant: bass, third and fifth or bass, third and sixth. They are equally valid. The progression from consonance to consonance is determined by the melodies.</p><p>Harmonic thinking only has one consonance, the triad: root, third and fifth. Octave displacement of the root results in the same consonances as polyphonic thinking, but they are &quot;inversions&quot; of a &quot;chord&quot; and not equal in their own right anymore. There are rules for stringing together chords, and a melody has to fit the chords. There are also rules about voice leading that more or less strive to make the inner voices as inconspicuous as possible, since there is supposed to be only one melody - the other parts are accompaniment.</p><p>This describes &quot;common practice&quot;, &quot;western&quot; music until atonality came along, and most musicians will know about sides of the musical coin.</p><p>&gt;&gt;perceive a screaming convoy of fanatical<br/>&gt;&gt;ultra-nationalist hooligans blasting their car&amp;truck<br/>&gt;&gt;horns that resonate with such intervals as 4/3, 9/8,<br/>&gt;&gt;27/22 (with a myriad of melodies of their own at<br/>&gt;&gt;that!)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is free improvisation generally understood as harmony<br/>&gt; or mere polyphony?</p><p>Or noise? :O)</p><p>&gt; I find free inprovisation very interesting.
