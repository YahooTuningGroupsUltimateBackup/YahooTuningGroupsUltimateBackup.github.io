Any feelings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jason yust<br/>&gt;<br/>We&apos;re halfway on the path back to &quot;Mark C.&quot; with this one... wouldn&apos;t<br/>you say??  BTW, I personally found those days, including the discussion<br/>of the implications of transferring esthetic vibrations ACROSS media...<br/>i.e. from sound to light or whatever, fascinating.  It seems most of it<br/>really is hogwash, though, but fun to think about.  Doesn&apos;t it seem like<br/>other psychological considerations in this are paramount... our<br/>associations of color with keys or sounds.  I believe this kind of<br/>approach is what Scriabin used... But are there not people who actually<br/>SEE frequencies as specific colors, through their specific mental<br/>wiring??  I thought I read something of this nature.  Wow, this is<br/>really a technical post...</p><p>_____________ _____ ___ _ _</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
