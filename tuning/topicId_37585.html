Would this new technique be playing real fast?</p><p>not necessarily.</p><p>[from the ages of 15 (when i started guitar) to 21 i was particularly<br/>concerned with playing fast, and sat there practicing (a rather<br/>limited set of techniques) with a metronome until i could match steve<br/>vai (i even had the same model guitar, which as you know is now<br/>refretted for 22-equal). since then, i haven&apos;t been particularly<br/>concerned with playing fast, though when i&apos;m in a certain mood and<br/>nice and warmed up, that&apos;s often how i do play. if you want to hear<br/>some sickly fast guitar though, listen to buckethead!]</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been wowing &apos;em from coast to coast this Spring by playing<br/>&gt;really slow.</p><p>that&apos;s excellent, and leads me into something i was planning to ask<br/>julia, which was whether minimalism could be considered western<br/>music. instead, i&apos;ll wait until i read her pnm article . . .</p></div>
