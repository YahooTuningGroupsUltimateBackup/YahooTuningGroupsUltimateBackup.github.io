Without<br/>spoiling the surprise, I&apos;ll just say that the upcoming CD is shaping<br/>up to be a cross between the best of Neil&apos;s 1st and 3rd CDs--in other<br/>words, cool microtonal rock riffage and wet, otherworldly atmospherics<br/>(plus a few new tricks I won&apos;t divulge).</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
