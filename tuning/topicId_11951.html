In<br/>fact if you took random numbers the results would be the same. As &gt;I stated<br/>before, the relationships between the planets are not simple ratios. If they<br/>were, a resonance &gt;would build up and destroy the orbit.  golden/noble<br/>relationships seem to be a necessity.</p><p>I think I slipped up and it may be simply the revolutionary, not rotational,<br/>periods of adjacent moons that tend lock into simple ratios. I think you&apos;re<br/>right about the noble relationships. Let me get back to you.</p></div>
