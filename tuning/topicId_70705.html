If you don&apos;t, messages in long threads get unweildy.<br/>It is appropriate to trim items that have been settled.</p><p>2.  But usually I trim before this point due to e-mail<br/>wrapping problems.  I refuse to post quoted text that&apos;s<br/>badly wrapped.  It&apos;s illegible crap and it shouldn&apos;t be<br/>posted.  I know several people who stopped reading the<br/>list because of it.  Blame the e-mail RFC for requiring<br/>hard wraps every 76 chars.<br/>To combat the problem, I reformat more text (by hand)<br/>than anyone I&apos;ve ever seen post to this list.  But I<br/>have limits to what I&apos;ll do.<br/>Insert returns manually at around 45 chars to allow<br/>ample room for replies, or set your client to hard wrap<br/>narrow, and watch me trim less of your context.<br/>Bravo to monz for pioneering this.  Narrow text is<br/>easier to read, too.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2007 12:12:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 2.

If i intend to reply to something<br/>that requires a quote, i quote as much of it as i have<br/>to and only snip what really isn&apos;t absolutely necessary,<br/>and then i spend ridiculous amounts of time manually<br/>inserting line-breaks and reformatting the text so<br/>that it doesn&apos;t look like crap.</p><p>But i sure do wish everyone else would just type<br/>short lines like i do, so that i (and you) wouldn&apos;t<br/>have to do this, and so that posts from all of those<br/>who don&apos;t do it wouldn&apos;t be filled with so much<br/>illegible crap.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
