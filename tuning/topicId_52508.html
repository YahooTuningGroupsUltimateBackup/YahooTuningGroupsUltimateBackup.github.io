Written by partners<br/>in life and song Karen Linsley and Lloyd Landa, &quot;The Pioneers of<br/>Mars&quot; was honored with the Mars Society&apos;s first Rouget de Lisle award<br/>in 2000.</p><p>Co-author Landa died unexpected of a heart attack days before the<br/>song&apos;s debut at the Mars Society&apos;s August 2000 Toronto conference,<br/>after which Karen exclaimed in tears, &quot;Get to Mars. And when the<br/>notes of this song are heard on Martian soil, he will live again.&quot;</p><p>You may hear &quot;The Pioneers of Mars&quot; and other songs from the Mars<br/>Society&apos;s recent collaboration album with Prometheus Music, &quot;To Touch<br/>the Stars&quot;, at <a href="http://www.prometheus-music.com/buy/thestars-ms.html">http://www.prometheus-music.com/buy/thestars-ms.html</a> .</p><p>In view of the success of the Prometheus Music &quot;To Touch the Stars&quot;<br/>CD,<br/>the Mars Society is proud to announce that it will hold its Second<br/>Rouget de Lisle Award contest for songs celebrating the cause of the<br/>human exploration and settlement of space.</p><p>We are asking for a tape or CD of songs, to be submitted together<br/>with a hardcopy of the lyrics by no later than April 30, 2004 to Mars<br/>Society, Box 273, Indian Hills, CO 80454. Songs can be any style;<br/>classical, folk, country, pop, jazz, rock and roll, etc. A committee<br/>of judges will then down select to ten finalists, who will be invited<br/>to play at the 7th International Mars Society Convention, Palmer<br/>House Hilton, Chicago, IL, Aug 19-22 2004. The audience will then<br/>vote for the winning songs. All finalists, however, will submitted to<br/>Prometheus Records for consideration for its next CD, and will also<br/>be forwarded to NASA for possible use as wakeup songs for crews of<br/>the International Space Station, the Mars Rovers, and the Cassini<br/>spacecraft which is now approaching Saturn!</p><p>So tune up your harps, space bards, turn in your songs and prepare to<br/>turn out for Chicago. Let your voices ring out into the solar system.<br/>Mars needs music, and the Chicago conference is going to be the<br/>Woodstock of Mars!</p><p>For further information about the Mars Society, visit our website at<br/><a href="http://www.marssociety.org">www.marssociety.org</a>.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>czhang23@aol.com</h3><span>2/18/2004 12:40:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Subject: Arturo Salinas, Martian Anthem<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does anyone have a current email address for Arturo Salinas. The one I<br/>&gt;have seems to be obsolete.</p><p>    John, I tried looking high and low just 3-4 wks ago for any Salinas&apos;<br/>music or email. Found the Deep Listening site, but that&apos;s not what I needed. Seems<br/>- ever since IIRC leaving Mills - he&apos;s incommunicado. In fact it _seems_ the<br/>Mills website and the linked faculty/alumni webpages no longer have even a<br/>trace of him. What&apos;s with that? Another Mills &quot;purge&quot;? Or Salinas just choosing<br/>to be incommunicative?</p><p>&gt;Now is your chance to write a xenharmonic anthem for Mars [...]</p><p>    Neat-o. ::already imaging something along some kind of de-constructed<br/>dominant-9th chordal lines . . . in some type of microtonal wolf&amp;tritone-rich<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; scale of course::</p><p>---|-----|--------|-------------|---------------------|<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist: &quot;Nah, I don&apos;t wanna take over the<br/>world, just the sound spectrum to make it my home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Then out to the flaming stars...<br/>From then, eventually unshackle time,<br/>and traverse galaxies...&quot; - Lou Harrison</p></div>
