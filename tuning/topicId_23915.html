You can change this at Sheet1!E53. I think if you set it to 1<br/>it will be instant.</p><p>If you set your screen resolution to 640x480 and choose Excel&apos;s<br/>View/Full-Screen you can have it fill most of the screen without any<br/>speed degradation. Ctrl-S and Ctrl-G work for Stop and Go.</p><p>There&apos;s another problem when running under Windows NT. It seems to<br/>lose most of the keypresses or button-clicks when it is running. So<br/>just keep bouncing up and down on that control-S (or &quot;Stop&quot; button)<br/>until one gets thru and it stops (after the fade-out).</p><p>Not getting all the voices is a new one. Can you please give more<br/>details. Is anyone else experiencing this.</p><p>For other folks that may be trying to run this thing for the first<br/>time: You will need to enable macros. You may need to click the MIDI<br/>out button and choose your MIDI device and close and save it, before<br/>you can hear anything.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=23947 href="#23947">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 1:24:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Not getting all the voices is a new one.

He said the older version worked just fine.</p><p>&gt;Is anyone else experiencing this.</p><p>On my machine, the new version seems not to respond right away when<br/>you change the factors. You have to reverse it and then play it<br/>forwards again before the changes take effect. The old version was<br/>much better in this respect, and in others, including the ability to<br/>respond to the &quot;stop&quot; button.</p></div>
