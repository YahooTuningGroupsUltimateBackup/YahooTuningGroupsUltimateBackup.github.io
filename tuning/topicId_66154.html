This must be muqadderat<br/>&gt; (predestination) as I&apos;m used to say, although I&apos;m a Mutazilite now, that<br/>&gt; your re-appearance coincides with my mention of you.</p><p>I was just reading about Mu&apos;taziliya the other day, and I have been having a lot of cases of synchronicity lately, like this one. (I&apos;m getting caught up on philosophy in general, particularly ancient Greek and Chinese.)</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think I want to use your 8:10:14:19:23 chord in something now, and<br/>&gt;&gt; 12:15:21:28:35 can be a 7-limit alternative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you also try 12:15:21:28:35:36(:38) ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also check out 8:10:14:19:23:27.</p><p>The chord 12:15:21:28:35 in the key of E would be notated E-G#-Dd-Gd-Bd using Turkish accidentals; in 41-tone*, the pitches are 0-13-33-50(9)-63(22). Despite having that semi-diminished twelfth (which I normally equate to 32/11 rather than 35/12), the chord isn&apos;t that dissonant compared to any other complex jazz chord. The secondary major third on the septimal minor seventh helps a lot. But I wouldn&apos;t recommend adding the perfect twelfth; the chord gets a little painful. A perfect fifth would work better since it wouldn&apos;t create that 35:36 quartertone cluster, and it would give more emphasis to the root, making the chord sound less like a major third with utonally-related notes attached beneath. (That would create a 12:15:18:21:28:35 chord.)</p><p>I&apos;m listening to the chord with the &quot;tense&quot; major eleventh (27/8, the note C#|) now, and that adds to the subminor seventh something similar to a semi-diminished octave. I&apos;m using the basic piano sound on my computer&apos;s MIDI output, and I don&apos;t hear the note very well, so we might be going over the note limit now.</p><p>*41-tone meaning 41-EDO or something close to it; I use my own &quot;well-tempered&quot; Pythagorean tuning with that many notes per octave.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div>
