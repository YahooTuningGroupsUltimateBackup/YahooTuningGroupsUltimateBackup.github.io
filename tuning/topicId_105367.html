Rather, I stated that the scale you came up with, completely independently of Helmholtz or anyone else, just *happened* to be related to a kind of tempering named in honor of Helmholtz.</p><p>Mathematically, this isn&apos;t as unlikely as it might seem, because the schisma (the comma of helmholtz temperament) is such an unusually good comma - being quite small, yet simple enough to appear by accident in a 12-note JI scale.</p><p>&gt; I apologize for the unfair words I used in the first paragraphs of my latest message.</p><p>No worries.</p><p>Now, one big question I want to ask you is this: What do you like about the PIAJI II scale? What are its attractive properties? And specifically, what properties are useful for ACTUAL MUSIC using this scale? That&apos;s what I want to know.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
