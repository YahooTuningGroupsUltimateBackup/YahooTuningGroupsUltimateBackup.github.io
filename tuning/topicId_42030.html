MIDI is the worst culprit, and everything<br/>&gt; stems from there.</p><p>Well, really.  MIDI gets far to much blame for this.  If 12 were &quot;the only means of music presentation&quot; why would they have added a tuning standard?  The original specification may have mentioned half-steps -- I don&apos;t have a copy -- but the implementation was left pretty much open. Hence instruments like the DX7II that allowed for tuning tables.</p><p>Also, not all keyboards are seven-white-five-black, and not all sequencers and notation packages are commercial.  There are packages that do work with different tunings -- Finale has support for general octave sizes that nobody seems to be using.  Lime does something or other, and could probably be enhanced if anybody expressed sufficient interest.  And there&apos;s a quartertone plugin for Sibelius.  Cubase has some kind of tuning support that got mentioned recently.  Even sequencers with no explicit microtonal support have a piano roll view, so you can avoid the tyrrany of 12.</p><p>Starr Labs make a number of MIDI input devices that don&apos;t guide you into 12 note octaves.  And I&apos;ve been pointed to this site that tells you how to rebuild keyboards so they aren&apos;t 7+5 any more:</p><p><a href="http://www.balanced-keyboard.com">http://www.balanced-keyboard.com</a></p><p>&gt; The vast majority of music today is not &apos;acoustic&apos; but &apos;electronic&apos;.<br/>&gt; Software and Hardware manufacturers push electronics as *the* way of music,<br/>&gt; from the mp3 player to the midi sequenced synthesiser rendition burned to<br/>&gt; CD, or posted to the net.

But that is a strange definition.  The bit about pushing MP3 players is pure fantasy.  When MP3 caught on, the big manufacturers didn&apos;t push standalone players at all -- they tried to ban them.</p><p>Software manufacturers are going to push electronics because software won&apos;t work otherwise.

I seriously doubt, though, that<br/>MIDI can be blamed for all this.  It&apos;s seems its development is more<br/>reflective of our overall culture.</p><p>A few years ago I went into the Metropolitan Museum and enjoyed<br/>looking at a keyboard from 500 years ago.  Yes, it looked just like<br/>our keyboard today, typical Halberstadt layout with 12 pitches. I&apos;m<br/>not sure what the specific tuning would have been, but probably not<br/>too far from our *present* 12.</p><p>So, it only stands to reason that MIDI would reflect this cultural<br/>situation.  Mind you, I also wish the spec. were more flexible and<br/>not so 12-based, but I can certainly see why it might turn out that<br/>way...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=42041 href="#42041">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2003 7:40:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Mark,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Mark Gould&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mark.gould@argonet.co.uk">mark.gould@argonet.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, January 31, 2003 12:20 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] The Tyranny of Twelve<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not academia we have to worry about, but<br/>&gt; rather the nature of the medium in which music<br/>&gt; is written today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take MIDI, take the Seven-white-five-black<br/>&gt; keyboards, take modern sequencer programs, take<br/>&gt; music notation packages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The commercial nature of these products, and<br/>&gt; their rigidity of presentation of twelve as *the*<br/>&gt; means of music creation, as *the only* means of<br/>&gt; music presentation is what irks me.
