When I wanted some people to<br/>&gt; set up some kind of meantone tempering on a regular piano at my<br/>&gt; former school a number of years ago, I made a CD full of sawtooth<br/>&gt; waves of the single tone periods, then the beat rates, and<br/>&gt; finally the major chords.</p><p>I agree with Petr -- the harpsichord&apos;s attacks help in moving<br/>passages, but can even become a bit deafening in listening<br/>tests with isolated chords.<br/>And the last chord seems to start fading out before sounding as<br/>long as the first two.  Plus, this *is* a harder test, with<br/>two variables and only one trial per.
