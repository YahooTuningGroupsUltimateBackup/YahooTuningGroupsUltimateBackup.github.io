If you were to encode it at, say, 16k or 20k (24k at most) &gt;instead of<br/>&gt; 128k, then those of us with modem connections (probably 95% or more) would be able &gt;to listen to<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>I encoded this for my own server when I was experimenting with a<br/>utility that was supposed to allow various bitrate reencoding on the<br/>fly. There must be a way to get this streaming at a lower bitrate<br/>without reencoding everything.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Paul H.

Who are Mark Mariano and John Simons?</p><p>Mark Mariano and John Simons are Neil&apos;s old drummer and bass player. I<br/>may have the info wrong on that cut. I think Neil actually played bass on<br/>that. As for the playlist, I don&apos;t have time to get it together for<br/>you before I leave on vacation. Remind me in a couple of weeks and I<br/>will see what I can do.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;</p></div>
