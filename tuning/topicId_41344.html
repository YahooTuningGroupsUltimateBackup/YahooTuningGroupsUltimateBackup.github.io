So the producers of the best Dutch new music program phoned me in<br/>&gt;California and asked me to help them fill in some gaps in their broadcast<br/>&gt;and luckily Terry was available to do the interview.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For your information, the program is called &quot;Supplement.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The broadcast takes place at 10pm-1am Holland time and can be heard on the<br/>&gt;internet over your computer.  For information, see<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.omroep.nl/nps/supplement/">http://www.omroep.nl/nps/supplement/</a> and click on December 8: Terry Riley.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then scroll down past the photo of Terry to the one of him being<br/>&gt;interviewed by me and click on Charles Amirkhanian to see updated info on<br/>&gt;Other Minds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If you want to listen in to the broadcast on your computer, log on during<br/>&gt;the broadcast time (10pm-1am Holland which equals 1pm-4pm Pacific Time,<br/>&gt;December 8, Sunday.  If you&apos;re in New York, listen between 4pm and 7pm<br/>&gt;Eastern Standard Time.)  This program is on most every week at the same<br/>&gt;time and truly is interesting.  Lots of it is in English.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Charles Amirkhanian</p></div><h3><a id=41385 href="#41385">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>12/6/2002 9:38:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Charles Amirkhanian wrote:<br/>&gt;The broadcast takes place at 10pm-1am Holland time and can be heard on<br/>the<br/>&gt;internet over your computer.
