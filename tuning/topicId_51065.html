The idea, if you&apos;re sticking to the same number of notes<br/>per octave that are in the MIDI file you&apos;re starting with (12), is to<br/>align the wolves of the tuning with harmonies that do not occur in<br/>the piece in question.

In which case he has to be doing something<br/>a lot more sophisticated than just mapping from each MIDI pitch to<br/>the corresponding pitch in the new tuning. Which means that other<br/>issues could and should be involved in the &apos;recasting&apos; decision --<br/>for example, a chord progression like Cmaj-Fmaj-Dmin-Gmaj-Cmaj would<br/>drift by about a quartertone in Pajara, and that would probably not<br/>be something agreeable to the composer . . .</p><p>Sorry to bust in, but I have a feeling I may be able to aid<br/>communication in this particular exchange (even if I know little, as<br/>yet, of the precise details).</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=51069 href="#51069">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2004 5:33:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, Gene just answered Carl that he&apos;s *not* using 12-note<br/>&gt; tunings for these pieces.</p><p>Pajara[12] and Wreckpop are of course 12-note scales.

And<br/>&gt; you go so far as to give non-systematic non-descriptive names to<br/>these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I figure that if people have specific unusual requirements for<br/>&gt; temperaments such as these, they can just go and find them with<br/>&gt; Graham&apos;s wonderful online temperament finder. There&apos;s no need to<br/>&gt; catalog them as if they were just as lilely to find actual musical<br/>use<br/>&gt; as say porcupine or orwell. I feel a catalog or article should<br/>include<br/>&gt; only those temperaments that are likely to be of _general_ musical<br/>&gt; interest (albeit to microtonalists only), not only of interest for a<br/>&gt; specific purpose such as notation or computation or synthetic<br/>&gt; inharmonic timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no idea how Graham feels about this issue [of how we should<br/>&gt; decide what to leave out], but I certainly don&apos;t find any dross in<br/>his<br/>&gt; existing (although somewhat random) catalog.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan</p><p>***Personally, I *love* these kinds of *musical* Dave Keenan posts!<br/>You go Dave!

And also includes 130-equal.  31&amp;41&amp;58 also tempers out 144:143, taking the nearest approximation to 31-equal.</p><p>It&apos;s likely to be in the higher limits that planar temperaments come into their own, and this is the most efficient way of specifying one.

It&apos;s a little<br/>less clear how this relates to meantone (5&amp;7), but then only some meantones<br/>are compatible with 225;224 (specifically, the 12&amp;19 subset of meantone).<br/>As long as the ET is consistent with whatever subset of the primes you&apos;re<br/>interested in, it uniquely identifies a point in this space, so you should<br/>be able to use three consistent ET&apos;s to uniquely identify a plane (as long<br/>as the three ET&apos;s aren&apos;t on the same line). So you do need to specify which<br/>primes you&apos;re interested in; &quot;5&amp;7&quot; is the same as &quot;12&amp;19&quot; on the 5-limit<br/>chart, but they&apos;re distinct in the 7-limit.

The deviations from JI are -0.26, +0.10, and<br/>-0.27 of a step (for 3:1, 5:1, and 7:1); none of the differences between<br/>these add up to more than 0.5 (unless you&apos;re using some other definition of<br/>consistency).</p><p>I can see the problem if you don&apos;t always use the lowest numbered<br/>consistent ET&apos;s; it wouldn&apos;t be obvious whether &quot;12&amp;19&amp;22&quot; or &quot;29&amp;31&amp;41&quot; is<br/>the same as something already on your list. For marvel, 9-ET happens to be<br/>the smallest ET, but I neglected to consider 4-ET for starling (who&apos;d have<br/>thought that 4-ET would be consistent with _anything_?), so starling should<br/>properly be &quot;4&amp;12&amp;15&quot;.</p><p>It might be better to set an arbitrary lower limit (nothing less than<br/>12-ET?) on the ET&apos;s that define the points through which the linear<br/>temperament runs.

So 41&amp;58&amp;72 defines a 13-limit<br/>&gt;temperament that fits my 7-limit neutral-third lattice!  And also<br/>&gt;includes 130-equal.  31&amp;41&amp;58 also tempers out 144:143, taking the<br/>&gt;nearest approximation to 31-equal.</p><p>I have a tendency to overlook commas like 243;242, since I tend to find<br/>these unsystematically, usually looking for some lower limit approximation<br/>of 11/8 (so the 11 exponent always ends up as 1 or -1).

For marvel, 9-ET happens to be<br/>&gt; the smallest ET, but I neglected to consider 4-ET for starling (who&apos;d have<br/>&gt; thought that 4-ET would be consistent with _anything_?), so starling should<br/>&gt; properly be &quot;4&amp;12&amp;15&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; It might be better to set an arbitrary lower limit (nothing less than<br/>&gt; 12-ET?) on the ET&apos;s that define the points through which the linear<br/>&gt; temperament runs. But then you&apos;d leave out a few odd temperaments like beep<br/>&gt; [0 3 -2], which isn&apos;t consistent with anything above 9-ET (although from<br/>&gt; looking at Paul Erlich&apos;s enormously useful horagram charts, it has some<br/>&gt; potentially interesting-looking larger scales, as I noted in the &quot;beep-9<br/>&gt; pelog&quot; thread).</p><p>7-limit planar and 5-limit linear temperaments can happily be defined using their commas.
