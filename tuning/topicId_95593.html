The interval from 7/5 to 18/11 is 90/77, which is 540/539 sharper than 7/6. Tempering by 540/539 leads to a chord which is a sort of unidecimal diminished seventh of sorts: 7/6-6/5-7/6-11/9, closing out at an octave. If you add 225/224 to the comma mix, you get unidecimal marvel temperament, with 1-5/4-14/9 tempering to a 5/4-5/4-9/7 triad. If you have 7/6-7/5-7/6-18/11 chords in the octave classes equal to some value mod four, and 5/4-5/4-9/7 equal to some value mod three, you get various twelve note scales, which might be interesting. I plan to find the twelve-note hobbit for unidecimal marvel and see if that has any of these chords.</p><p>This 7/6-6/5-7/5-11/9 chord has, of course each interval one apart as an 11-limit consonance. Two apart gives 7/5, 7/5, 10/7, 10/7, and three apart of course inverts one apart. So it&apos;s all consonances, and ones pretty close to just, since tempering out 540/539 leads to a very accurate tuning.</p></div><h3><a id=95594 href="#95594">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2011 11:59:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;I plan to find the twelve-note hobbit for unidecimal marvel and see if that has any of these chords.</p><p>It turns out that if you tune both to 72et, a very reasonable choice, unidecimal marvel12 and prodigy12 become the same scale. This scale has three 7/6-6/5-7/6-11/9 quasi-diminished chords and two 5/4-5/4-9/7 augemented chords among its other talents.</p></div>
