A rose by any other name......etc. :-) But seriously,<br/>the best argument for a &quot;raised&quot; pitch being higher than a &quot;lowered&quot; one is<br/>the very chromatic music of the mid-seventeenth century. In most of these<br/>slow kaleidoscopic passages, the continuo would likely have been silent.<br/>There would be no way for it to play those passages in any kind of<br/>reasonable tuning, even considering the added digitals used on some<br/>keyboards.</p><p>My concern for calling &quot;a spade a spade&quot; is that it contributes to _musical_<br/>performance tuning. For example, performing the melody of &quot;St. Louis Blues,<br/>a singer who puts a stylistic #2 appoggiatura before the first note (E in C)<br/>in the phrase &quot;_I_ hate to see...&quot; will likely put a very low b3 (Eb) on<br/>&quot;...the evening _sun_ go down. Granted this is not a Baroque example, but I<br/>believe that any chromatic music in a &quot;functional harmony&quot; style will make<br/>more harmonic sense when accidentals are performed this way. Call me boorish<br/>and unstylish if you must. That&apos;s just the way I see (hear) it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m just suggesting that keyboard tuning was and is irrelevant to the<br/>&gt;&gt;way ears tend to tune music if left to their own devices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you have to look beyond your concept of a universal &quot;music&quot; to<br/>&gt; specific styles and compositions and the type of tuning issues involved in<br/>&gt; each of them, both in their creation and their subsequent realization. Also<br/>&gt; you should be more cognizant of the degree to which music is a cultural<br/>&gt; &quot;game&quot;, and the how meaning of music for us is so strongly dependent on our<br/>&gt; previous experiences with it and the associations it carries.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you are right, to some extent. My concern has to do with how that<br/>relates to basic perception of pitch relations regardless of period styles.<br/>Are you still telling me that there is no such thing? My experience prevents<br/>me (so far) from believing that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Very likely,<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;mistuned&quot; keyboards in Handel&apos;s day were a bane to vocal tuning, just as<br/>&gt;&gt;they are today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As far as we know, the pure thirds and low leading tones of meantone tuning<br/>&gt; were most comfortable for the singers of the time.</p><p>The key words here are &quot;as far as we know.&quot; In fact, we _don&apos;t know for<br/>sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More on nature vs. nurture:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Arabic music, the minor third is divided melodically into two nearly<br/>&gt; equal neutral seconds (go listen to some Arabic music and you&apos;ll hear this).<br/>&gt; This is a most natural thing for Arabic musicians to sing and they sing it<br/>&gt; without thought. Now you try it. Unless you&apos;ve listened to a lot of Arabic<br/>&gt; music, you&apos;ll probably find this impossible to do. Why? Are our brains,<br/>&gt; ears, or throats structured differently from those of Arabic musicians? Of<br/>&gt; course not. It&apos;s just that we&apos;ve never _experienced_ this, having listened<br/>&gt; to lullabies, symphonies, and other musical events _with cultural meaning_<br/>&gt; in diatonic scales all our lives. What is this new experience? It&apos;s got to<br/>&gt; be a mistake, an unskilled amateur trying to sing, right? At first, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what it sounds like. But once we&apos;ve heard this phenomenon enough times, our<br/>&gt; brain begins to characterize it as something distinct, something meaningful,<br/>&gt; with its own quality, until it finally sounds like a real musical phrase.<br/>&gt; Once one hears it this way, it immediately becomes _far_ easier to sing<br/>&gt; (this happened to me). In the context of Arabic music, which has no triadic<br/>&gt; or functional harmony, this is undoubtedly the _right_ thing to sing,<br/>&gt; whether there is instrumental backing or not. The musical motifs of the<br/>&gt; maqamat have their own structural logic that _coevolved_ with the tuning<br/>&gt; they use. Tuning and style are intimately intertwined and one cannot make<br/>&gt; judgments of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in one independently of the other.</p><p>No problem here. I&apos;m quite sure I understand your point, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily relate to my concern regarding the tuning of Western music,<br/>which appears to have some basis in acoustical relationships. Note that I<br/>have not claimed that a &quot;high third&quot; is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot; It simply &quot;is.&quot;<br/>The discussion of historical practice is rather beside the point. Whether or<br/>not you are &quot;right&quot; in that regard, my observations are my observations. I<br/>have to deal with that. My hope is that you understand what I have<br/>described. I&apos;m not sure you do.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=8782 href="#8782">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Why would I believe<br/>anything else? There&apos;s no evidence, and Occam&apos;s razor (combined with my<br/>knowledge of psychoacoustics) speaks against introducing other intervals<br/>(like the high third) into the palette of universally perceived pitch<br/>relations.</p><p>&gt;My hope is that you understand what I have<br/>&gt;described.
