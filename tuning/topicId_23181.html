I personally use terms like &quot;minor/major seconds&quot; etc. for<br/>describing tunings just like anyone else.  I just think it&apos;s absurd when you<br/>really think about it, and a conceptual liberation from these out-dated ideas<br/>would be a positive change for &quot;traditional&quot; musicians, allowing many more<br/>minds to be open to more flexible ways of thinking.</p><p>Aaron</p></div>
