Some virtual instruments I know of that actually support<br/>this are FM7 and the TimeWARP 2600.</p><p>Decent:<br/>-  if the instrument DOES NOT respond to the MIDI Tuning Spec,<br/>then the app generating the notes must:<br/> - generate each note w/ necessary pitch bend to tune the note<br/> - generate each note on a separate MIDI channel<br/>This usually works if:<br/>  - the target synth doesn&apos;t try to re-order MIDI messages<br/>     (I hear that Logic sometimes does this), which would screw up the<br/>pitch bend messages<br/>  - the target synth can run in multi-timbral mode w/ the necessary<br/>number of parts,<br/>    one part per voice.</p><p>FYI:<br/>The AU spec has direct support for per-note alternate tunings<br/>via an &apos;extended Note API&apos;.  All synths are supposed to support<br/>this, but I assume that most of them throw away any fractional<br/>pitch information.</p><p>Alternate tuning support in Numerology would definitely support<br/>the latter, and probably also the first two, though I don&apos;t know what<br/>the implementation priority would be.</p><p>In Num 2.0, *all* pitch values are 32-bit float, and are only converted<br/>to 7-bit MIDI values at the last minute.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jim&quot;</p><p>I learn something new every day.  What I just learned:</p><p>- Audio Unit specificiation (Mac OSX) supports per-note alternate tunigns<br/>- Logic already implements Hermode tuning (yes, I really didn&apos;t know)<br/>- Jim hung out with Robert Rich (champion of JI in synth music world))<br/>at NAMM</p></div>
