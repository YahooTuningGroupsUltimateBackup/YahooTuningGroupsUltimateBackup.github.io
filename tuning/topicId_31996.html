The tuning-math people periodically report in<br/>here on developments, and metatuning is a great place to &apos;step<br/>outside&apos; and take threads that have drifted away from tuning but are<br/>still of interest to a small group (rather than just personal 1-to-1<br/>email).</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon (who is going to have to work harder to wrest the #1 Upsetter<br/>Crown from Paul...)</p></div>
