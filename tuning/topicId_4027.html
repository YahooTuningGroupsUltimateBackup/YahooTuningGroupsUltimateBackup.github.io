How, or in what sense, am I using degree numbers?</p><p>By calling chords &quot;subminor 6th&quot;, &quot;diminished 7th&quot;, etc.</p><p>&gt;Thanks for the Miller URL. Of course this talks about 7 +- 2 notes _total_<br/>&gt;in short term memory at any given time, not 7 +- 2 notes _per_octave_ in a<br/>&gt;scale.</p><p>Indeed.  This was discussed on the list around Thanksgiving (can&apos;t remember<br/>if we were on onelist yet).  I don&apos;t think any conclusion was reached.</p><p>&gt;But I guess it _is_ desirable for a whole octave to fit in STM.</p><p>I think there may be a feeling associated with keeping all the<br/>octave-equivalent tones of a scale in STM, but I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s always<br/>desirable, and I think the limit is probably more on the -2 side of 7 for<br/>most people.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Rothenberg was able to explain the selection of 5 and 7 using only two<br/>&gt;&gt;measures: stability and efficiency.  Stability is essentially the<br/>&gt;&gt;percentage of the scale&apos;s intervals which are &quot;ambiguous&quot;, that is, which<br/>&gt;&gt;appear in more than one interval class.  For a definition of efficiency,<br/>&gt;&gt;see TD #52 and 55.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks for this explanation and pointer too. But I&apos;m not sure I understand<br/>&gt;them well enough to apply them to 4, 7, 8 and 11 of m3rds. Could you,<br/>&gt;please?</p><p>Stability is easy.  Just count the intervals that are not involved in any<br/>ambiguity and divide by the total number of intervals in the scale.  So the<br/>4-tone scale, like all strictly proper scales, has stability of 1.  The<br/>8-tone scale has stability of 0.35714, which is quite low.  The 7 and 11<br/>tone scales are improper, so stability is not defined.</p><p>Along with stability, I suggest two measures I call instability and<br/>impropriety.  The former is the portion of (octave-equivalent)<br/>log-frequency space which is covered by intervals of the scale (using the<br/>smallest and largest members of each scale degree as endpoints of a segment<br/>on the line for that degree).  The latter is the portion of the covered<br/>area which is more than singly covered.  When I&apos;ve figured out how to get<br/>Excel to draw these, I&apos;ll let you know.</p><p>The upshot here is that scales with low stability may tend to be used like<br/>improper scales in music.  So the Rothenberg portion of my argument<br/>favoring the 8-tone scale over the 11-tone one is weak, pending further<br/>listening and line graphs for each... the 11-tone version does have the<br/>considerable advantage that the minor thirds are all confined to one<br/>interval class...</p><p>Efficiency is the average number of tones you need to hear before you know<br/>which key the scale is being played in, divided by the number of tones in<br/>the scale.  If n is the number of scale tones and S_i the length of a<br/>key-minimal string, then efficiency is given by...</p><p>  n!<br/>(Sigma) S_i / n(n!)<br/>  i=1</p><p>...which is a bit of a pain.  Rothenberg mentions in a footnote that<br/>methods exist for calculating efficiency without having to find key-minimal<br/>strings at all.  Naturally, he refers to a paper that was never published.</p><p>&gt;&gt;What I like about Rothenberg&apos;s stuff is that he came up with it first,<br/>&gt;&gt;actually for a speech recognition model, and then applied it to music and<br/>&gt;&gt;got results that jived.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sounds great. I really want to learn this stuff, but I don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;make time to go and find the papers.</p><p>I should point out that to a large extent I am taking on faith his jiving<br/>results.  For convenience, he only considered scales as subsets of ETs.<br/>The original papers give results for subsets of 12tET only, and say write<br/>for further info.  I met with Rothenberg in May.  He said he had once made<br/>a printout for every equivalence class in 31tET (!), and had made<br/>comparisons with scales used around the world.  He hasn&apos;t touched this<br/>stuff in 30 years, however, and had trouble finding these supplementary<br/>materials (and even the papers which I had brought).</p><p>&gt;See what you think of it now.</p><p>Super!  The 4-naturals notation looks to be my fav, except I would have<br/>probably just used A-D.  It was clever how you got the 8-naturals notation<br/>to be alphabetical.  Of course, you still have to live with accidentals<br/>hopping scale degrees.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
