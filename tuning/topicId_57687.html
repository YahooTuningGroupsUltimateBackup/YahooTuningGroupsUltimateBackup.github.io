He merely states that this is the case. Any of his experimental or theoretical data to substantiate his claim has yet to be found or understood, which is why I am continuing to research his recently discovered last &quot;missing&quot; manuscript.</p><p>Harrison was a particularly original (and eccentric) character and thinker, as anyone who has read the book or seen the film of &quot;Longitude&quot; will appreciate; yet he did successfully devise at least three fundamentally important inventions, one of which changed the course of world history in the years following his discoveries.</p><p>(So John Harrison does fairly deserve a due level of respect.)</p><p>Now to the nitty-gritty of the significance of Harrison&apos;s writings and thoughts about musical tuning ......</p><p>1. The only integer ratio which Harrison used in his system is 2:1 for the octave ratio.</p><p>2. He refused to accept the traditional thinking which states that &quot;Perfect&quot; intervals should only be at small integer frequency ratios.</p><p>3. Harrison&apos;s system can generate any number of intervals in an octave. i.e. pi is an irrational, transcendental number, (as far as we know at present).</p><p>4. The beat rates seem to be important in biological and perceptive ways which we have yet to fully understand.</p><p>Now for the problems with the systems which it is compared to by Monz, Smith and others.</p><p>88 Equal</p><p> Although it approximates Harrison&apos;s results, 88 tET (edo) is derived by splitting the octave (ratio 2:1) into 88 equal intervals. Eighty eight equal intervals provides a lower limit of tuning granularity (1200/88)/2 =  13.63636/2 = 6.818182 cents.<br/>So any 88 edo interval is + or - 6.818182 cents from any chosen interval.<br/>I suppose this may seem satisfactory for the late 20th century microtonalists, who are still using pitchbend with a resolution of (1200/12)/64 = 1.5625 cents or YAMS at (1200/1024) at  1.171875 cents.</p><p>3/10 comma meantone</p><p>see:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/mean_tone.html">http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/mean_tone.html</a> for details.</p><p>3/10 comma meantone avoids the same resolution limitation of 88edo as it has the same a &quot;limited spiral&quot; mapping system as do all meantones, which are derived from integer ratios.<br/>The values for 1/3 comma meantone are:<br/>derived from 6/5<br/>Fifth is at: 694.77 cents<br/>Large interval is at: 189.58 cents<br/>small interval is at: 126.15 cents<br/>It uses a generator which is derived 6/5 and will eventually become an equal temperament if you extend the steps for enough intervals.<br/>I am sure someone on the list can run a program to tell us the granularity limit.</p><p>Harrison used 695.49 for his fifth;</p><p>So each step of fourths or fifth from the starting point will produce an extra error of 695.49 - 694.77 = .72 cents per step.</p><p>So after 12 steps we have an error of 12 * .72 = 8.64 cents.<br/>As you continue the error increases.</p><p>If anyone tells you that LucyTuning (derived from Harrison&apos;s writings) is for all practical purposes the same as 88edo and 1/3 comma meantone, examine their hidden aganda.<br/>Scratch a little deeper and I suspect that you will find that these same individuals are still advocating only tunings derived from integer frequency ratios. i.e. the same misguided logic that antagonised Harrison against Dr. Robert Smith 250-odd years ago.</p><p>Some people still argue against the whole principle of Charles Darwin&apos;s theory of evolution, and get labelled &quot;creationists&quot; or worse.<br/>Maybe someone on the tuning lsit can come up with a suitable name for those who insist that all musical intervals and harmonics should only be at integer frequency ratios.</p><p>Please post suggestions!!!!</p><p>I have put a transcription of the musical parts of &quot;Concerning Such Mechanism .......&quot; at:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/academic/csm_transcription.html">http://www.lucytune.com/academic/csm_transcription.html</a></p><p>Information about the &quot;missing&quot; last manuscript is at:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/academic/manuscript_search.html">http://www.lucytune.com/academic/manuscript_search.html</a></p><p>I have made digital images of all the photocopies of the 180-odd pages of the &quot;missing&quot; manuscript from the Library of Congress, so if anyone wants to plough through them please email me for instructions and I&apos;ll get them to you somehow.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2005 1:46:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Charles,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Harrison developed an entirely novel basis for his<br/>&gt; calculations of music intervals.<br/>&gt; He calculated them from pi.<br/>&gt; As far as I am aware we have yet to discover the<br/>&gt; underlying reason or logic which he used to come to<br/>&gt; this extraordinary conclusion.

If a rational approximation to pi is chosen, the<br/>corresponding fifth defined in the manner of Harrison will close; 88<br/>equal is what you get if you use the well-known approximation<br/>pi ~ 22/7. Pi ~ 3 would give you 12-equal.</p><p>&gt;   Although it approximates Harrison&apos;s results, 88 tET (edo) is derived<br/>&gt; by splitting the octave (ratio 2:1) into 88 equal intervals. Eighty<br/>&gt; eight equal intervals provides a lower limit of tuning granularity<br/>&gt; (1200/88)/2 =  13.63636/2 = 6.818182 cents.<br/>&gt; So any 88 edo interval is + or - 6.818182 cents from any chosen<br/>&gt; interval.<br/>&gt; I suppose this may seem satisfactory for the late 20th century<br/>&gt; microtonalists, who are still using pitchbend with a resolution of<br/>&gt; (1200/12)/64 = 1.5625 cents or YAMS at (1200/1024) at  1.171875 cents.</p><p>Since Harrison was not proposing to extend the circle of fifths even<br/>as far as 88 fifths, this isn&apos;t relevant.</p><p>&gt; 3/10 comma meantone</p><p>&gt; It uses a generator which is derived 6/5 and will eventually become an<br/>&gt; equal temperament if you extend the steps for enough intervals.</p><p>This is true to exactly the same extent, and in the same way, as it is<br/>also true of Harrison&apos;s fifth. If you extend either of them to 88<br/>notes to an octave it is already getting pretty regular. If you were<br/>to extend the Harrison fifth to 1420 notes to the octave, it would be<br/>extremely regular, since it would have one fifth which was a mere<br/>0.0115 cents flatter than all the rest. If you want to avoid, as far<br/>as possible, this sort of thing using pi is not a good plan; you<br/>should use phi and consider the golden meantone. However, there is no<br/>reason to think this had anything to do with Harrison&apos;s tuning ideas.</p><p>&gt; I am sure someone on the list can run a program to tell us the<br/>&gt; granularity limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harrison used 695.49 for his fifth;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So each step of fourths or fifth from the starting point will produce<br/>&gt; an extra error of 695.49 - 694.77 = .72 cents per step.</p><p>No, because the 3/10-comma fifth is 695.50, only 0.01 cents sharper.</p><p>&gt; If anyone tells you that LucyTuning (derived from Harrison&apos;s writings)<br/>&gt; is for all practical purposes the same as 88edo and 1/3 comma meantone,<br/>&gt; examine their hidden aganda.</p><p>You might also examine their math. If it is good, then they are<br/>correct. Moreover, even if 0.01 cent is not close enough for your<br/>superhuman ears, there will always be some approximation which will be<br/>The 1420-equal system, which gets within .0000081 cent, should suffice.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2005 11:37:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You remind me very much of Rauf Yekta, Charles.
