I can only imagine that partly explains why when many people<br/>think &quot;micro-tonal&quot; they think 24TET and not, say, 22TET.</p><p>Hence (as I see it):<br/>1)   Base-2 is biased to octaves (not a huge bias as many scales include<br/>octaves)<br/>2)   Base-x is biased to TET-type scales and encourages the scale designer to<br/>not use uneven interval sizes to make the scale look numerically tidy.  A fairly<br/>significant bias IMVHO, but still fine for many types of scales/tunings using<br/>tones not-so-far from TET tunings.<br/>3)   The cent has the two biases above plus the IMVHO much greater bias of<br/>marking everything relative to compliance with the 12TET semi-tone, a special<br/>case of &quot;base-X&quot; compliance which may well encourages scale creators to make and<br/>use scales (as much like 12TET IE &quot;what they know first&quot;) as possible.<br/>4)  Decimals have essentially no bias, but not optimization for anything<br/>either.  It&apos;s like building with custom bricks instead of pre-made/pre-shaped<br/>walls.<br/>5)  Fractions have a bias toward ratios that summarize to low-limit ratios,<br/>which may create a bias against use of ratios not summarize-able into<br/>low-numbered fractions.

So logarithmic has some psycho-acoustic analysis<br/>advantages while linear-decimal has others.  Not to mention that someone you<br/>easily use a combination of both IE 1.0245^x.

For one, you<br/>can easily categorize classes of intervals which don&apos;t fit together evenly.  IE,<br/>to me it seems clear 8/5 and 16/11, though very near on a cent scale, are two<br/>totally different interval classes with two very different<br/>feelings/aesthetic-values useful in music in very different ways.  If you<br/>visualize it in cents or even decimal you may well think &quot;oh, they look about<br/>the same in value and probably sound about the same&quot;...but that seems utterly<br/>incorrect when you actually hear the mood of those dyads.  Meanwhile take 22/15<br/>(which looks much more complex due to larger numbers) vs. 3/2.  Numerically very<br/>different, but in many ways they have a similar feel...certainly a lot more so<br/>than the rather close (in cents) 16/11 does to 3/2.</p><p>   Erm...what can I say...fractions have class! :-)</p><p>Me&gt;&gt; ........the tough part becomes figuring out and, in general, agreeing on<br/>what</p><p>&gt;&gt; fractions count as boundaries to all potential tonal classes.....</p><p>&gt;&quot;There IS no one size fits all answer like the above to this sort of thing.&quot;<br/>   That&apos;s why I say &quot;in general&quot;.

What you&apos;ve just said sounds akin to saying if 3 + 3 = 6<br/>then 6 can&apos;t also be the square root of 36.  You could even go the level of<br/>saying each &quot;class&quot; has multiple derivations...but the point is to still<br/>say/agree it belongs to a single class so it can be both agreed upon and favored<br/>among a large percent of the musical community.</p></div><h3>Tony &#x3C;leopold_plumtree@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2010 10:45:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Often the difference you deal with are more like 10-20<br/>cents where how many cents difference there are between two &quot;similar&quot; dyads can<br/>change the mood dramatically.<br/>  Even something like 12 cents can make a huge difference in feel for certain<br/>dyads IE (again) the 1.636363 DYAD vs. the 1.625 one yet sound like just a minor<br/>de-tuning for others (IE 50/33 vs. 16/11).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Beyond that, I can&apos;t see how such units encourage anyone to go one way  or<br/>&gt;another in characterizing and using intervals.&quot;<br/>  I figure it&apos;s easier to define memorize-able tone classes in fractional form<br/>(11/9 being a lot easier to memorize than &quot;about 347 cents&quot;.  And when you can&apos;t<br/>remember something, it makes sense to remember it as &quot;between two points you can<br/>memorize&quot;.  And how do you usually guess how much it will sound like one of<br/>those two points vs. the other?  Distance...</p><p>&gt;&quot;You just as easily  say people would be tempted to round integer ratios to ones<br/>&gt;of similar  value with simpler numbers.&quot;<br/>  True...neither system is perfect.<br/>  But cents seem to imply a straight line rising scale that invites you to<br/>compare things in &quot;distance&quot;.  Unless you sit down and calculate them, it&apos;s hard<br/>to know 50/33 is larger than 3/2, for example, while the fact say 104 cents is<br/>greater than 90 cents is blatantly obvious.  And if that user &quot;knows&quot; what 110<br/>cents and 100 cents sound like, that person is likely to just guess &quot;well it<br/>sounds a bit more like 100 cents because it&apos;s a bit closer&quot;.  And, back to my<br/>point, that kind of guess quite often is simply not true and gives a false sense<br/>of security about what something &quot;should sound like&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;In either case, I don&apos;t see it as a major  issue.  Both logarithmic and linear<br/>&gt;comparisons can be instructive.&quot;<br/>   True, but I&apos;m not talking about logarithmic vs. linear here.  I&apos;m talking<br/>about fractions lending themselves more to thinking about tunings and scales as<br/>tonal classes than logarithmic systems do.</p><p>-------------------------------------------</p><p>&gt;&gt;It&apos;s a lot easier to memorize<br/>&gt;&gt; 50/33 than 719.181 (cents)<br/>&gt;That&apos;s pretty questionable.  I get 719.354 cents for 50:33, BTW.<br/>  That was just a quick estimate and it doesn&apos;t change to point: I&apos;m not trying<br/>to prove how accurately I can convert from fractions to cents.  If you still<br/>want to be anal about it however...your more accurate answer 719.354 is no<br/>easier to memorize than 719.181...and both are much trickier to memorize than<br/>50/33.</p></div>
