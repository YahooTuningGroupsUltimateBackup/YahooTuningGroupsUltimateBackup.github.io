In traditional<br/>counterpoint both kinds of thirds are heard in close proximity, so<br/>even ordinary diatonic music is full of strongly contrasted intervals.<br/>When the practically-pure septimal tritones also come into play the<br/>mixture of intervals is fascinating. And all without leaving the tonal<br/>range of the usual, everyday chain of fifths.</p><p>Equal temperament, it is true, has a contrast of practically pure<br/>fifths with strongly tempered thirds: but in this case the thirds are<br/>basically so far from 5:4 or 6:5 that one is unable to appreciate them<br/>as slight mistunings of pure intervals. Their beating in most musical<br/>contexts is too rapid to produce any clear effect - and keyboard<br/>instruments of the ET era tend to suppress the relevant partials anyway.</p><p>One resulting point is that 2/7 comma and 1/5 comma meantone, although<br/>mathematically not very far from quarter comma, have actually quite<br/>different musical effects. In the first, all thirds are practically<br/>pure so there is less contrast between them, but fifths are strongly<br/>mistuned, to the verge of dissonance. In the second, the diatonic<br/>consonances are more or less equally mistuned, the tuning gives more a<br/>general effect of pretty good intonation without any great contrast<br/>between different chords.</p><p>Music conceived in one of these unequal meantones may be relatively<br/>boring (if strong diatonic contrasts are expected), or awkward (if<br/>such contrasts are not expected), in another.
