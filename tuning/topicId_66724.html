Comments??<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Carl,</p><p>First comment - I don&apos;t know what definition of<br/>pelog you&apos;re using; presumably something that&apos;s<br/>in Scala, and possibly something with a known<br/>rationale (if not known ratios)?</p><p>All I have used for Pelog in the past is the<br/>measurements in Ellis&apos; translation of Helmholtz,<br/>App. XX., II. Table of non-harmonic scales, Nos.<br/>96 to 102.  I&apos;m happy to use any better defintion;<br/>however, the remainder of my comments are based on<br/>those measurements, which give the pelog gamut in<br/>No. 96. as<br/>0 137 446 575 687 820 1098 (1200)<br/>cents,<br/>from which the various pentatonic scales are drawn,<br/>the one named Pelog being No. 97.,<br/>0 - 446 575 687 - 1098 (1200)</p><p>My main comment on this gamut is that the table of<br/>intervals between its notes contains very few exact<br/>repetitions, but when sorted and graphed, these<br/>show distinct clustering at two or three levels of<br/>detail.  (I have a spreadsheet showing this if you<br/>want to see it.)</p><p>However, there&apos;s distinct &quot;progression&quot; within each<br/>cluster of intervals, so it&apos;s hard to be sure exactly<br/>what few intervals were intended by its inventors<br/>(assuming they had something so simple in mind).</p><p>I did find that 67-EDO gives a reasonable approxima-<br/>tion to all the scale degrees and the intervals be-<br/>tween them, with only a few cents error at most.<br/>Still, I can&apos;t see any reasonable way to analyse<br/>this as a scale of only one, two or even three step<br/>sizes.  In 67-EDO, the degrees of the gamut are<br/>separated by<br/>8 17 7 6 8 15 6<br/>steps (each of 1200/67 = 17.91045 cents).  I suppose<br/>one could make these instead<br/>7 16 7 7 7 16 7<br/>steps, but only if one is willing to introduce errors<br/>of up to 2 steps, around 36 cents.</p><p>The nearest fourths are 446 and 513 cents.<br/>The nearest fifths are 687 and 754 cents.<br/>On this basis, I don&apos;t see any worthwhile 3/2 or 4/3<br/>- 702 or 498 cents - do you?  Is a 15 cent error<br/>&quot;near enough&quot;?</p><p>Now, as to whether I&apos;ve heard the impropriety of<br/>Pelog - No, I haven&apos;t played with these scales<br/>enough recently, and I&apos;ve never been aware of trans-<br/>posing a motif in one (tho I&apos;ve probably done it).<br/>That&apos;s an experiment I ought to make!</p><p>However, I doubt it would worry me greatly either<br/>way, since I&apos;m perfectly happy to have both &quot;real&quot;<br/>and &quot;tonal&quot; answers in contrapuntal music generally,<br/>and have no trouble recognising that a motif has<br/>been so transposed.  I guess the only time I&apos;d find<br/>it weird would be if a transposition carried a<br/>an interval &quot;across&quot; a perceived fourth or fifth,<br/>eg if an original fifth became a third, or sixth<br/>became a fourth.  Does that make sense?</p><p>But to answer your question properly, I&apos;d have to<br/>tune up a pelog and play for a while.  Maybe this<br/>weekend.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2006 9:28:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/8/06, yahya_melb &lt;<a href="mailto:yahya@melbpc.org.au">yahya@melbpc.org.au</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; All I have used for Pelog in the past is the<br/>&gt; measurements in Ellis&apos; translation of Helmholtz,<br/>&gt; App. XX., II.

From<br/>laras pelog, he derived the jawar, liwung, and sorog scales; from<br/>laras salendro, he derived the madenda, degung, and degung mataram<br/>scales. Koesoemadinata&apos;s theoretical experiments were motivated by<br/>two overriding concerns.</p><p>First, he wished to construct a model for each tuning system (pelog<br/>and salendro) which would allow for the transposition of any scale<br/>within the respective tuning system, and for which each tone of the<br/>scale could theoretically function as the main tone of the scale<br/>(similar to a tonic function, which he called tonica) ...&quot;</p><p>Sounds a lot like a full-blown model of modes, doesn&apos;t it?  However,<br/>that doesn&apos;t mean that the different modes would necessarily be used<br/>in the same composition, which is perhaps contrary to the idea of<br/>maintaining a consistent &apos;pathet&apos; or ethos.  Also, Weintraub points<br/>out that Kusumadinata&apos;s theoretical descriptions could not apply to<br/>physical instruments - he describes scales (&apos;raras&apos; or &apos;laras&apos;)<br/>drawn from the 9 tones as if they actually existed on an single<br/>instrument, whereas the fixed-pitch instruments have at most seven<br/>pitches.</p><p>Outside the gamelan tradition, and considering a particular pelog<br/>scale simply as a tone resource, we have of course no such<br/>limitations, and may cheerfully move thru modes if we so desire.  We<br/>may also transpose motifs up and down at will on a (piano or<br/>electronic) keyboard, making the most baroque sequences, without the<br/>limitations of each player having only two notes (as in some gong<br/>arrays) so that even a motif of three or four notes must be divided<br/>between two musicians.</p><p>If instead of tuning my pelog selisir in exact 9-EDO, thus:<br/>...bem 0 0<br/>..gulu 1 133<br/>..dada 2 267<br/>[..... 3 400 skipped]<br/>.pelog 4 533<br/>..lima 5 667<br/>...nem 6 800<br/>barang 7 933<br/>[..... 8 1067 skipped]<br/>..bem2 9 1200</p><p>I were to tune the small intervals slightly narrower and the other<br/>two slightly wider, with maybe a few extra cents in the octave, thus:<br/>...bem 0 0<br/>..gulu 1 130<br/>..dada 2 260<br/>[..... 3 400 skipped]<br/>.pelog 4 540<br/>..lima 5 670<br/>...nem 6 800<br/>barang 7 930<br/>[..... 8 1070 skipped]<br/>..bem2 9 1210</p><p>I&apos;d have a classic pelog (much more conservative in its small<br/>variations from 9-EDO than those graphed in the article Keenan<br/>linked to), in which the wide steps dada:pelog and barang:bem2<br/>are 280 cents, while all the remaining, narrow steps are 130 cents.<br/>Thus two narrow steps always span a smaller interval than one wide<br/>step, so the scale is strictly improper.</p><p>I set this up on the keyboard as follows:<br/>...bem 0 0 .......... C .... + 0<br/>..gulu 1 130 ........ Db ... +30<br/>..dada 2 260 ........ Eb ... -40<br/>[..... 3 400 ........ E .... + 0 skipped]<br/>.pelog 4 540 ........ F .... +40<br/>..lima 5 670 ........

C .... + 0</p><p>(I couldn&apos;t manage the 1210 cent bem2, since my keyboard only allows<br/>octave-equivalent retunings within +-63 cents of the 12-EDO notes.)</p><p>Thus, if I skip every fourth key in the twelve (nominally, the notes<br/>of the augmented chord D F# A#) and play the remaining 9, I have the<br/>9-EDO gamut, slightly tempered; if I also skip nominal E and B, I<br/>have the laras Pelog selisir, on the nominals C Db Eb F G Ab Bbb<br/>(say).</p><p>Well, it&apos;s playable! I&apos;ve fiddled around with it for a few minutes,<br/>using typical Balinese alternating male-and-female rhythmic patterns<br/>(*), and my immediate impression is that the character of these<br/>changes so radically when I transpose the motif, that it&apos;s almost<br/>unrecognisable.  It&apos;s certainly nothing like a common-practice<br/>sequence.</p><p>(*) &apos;kot&egrave;kan&apos;; eg, a &apos;chandetan&apos;, in which the &apos;nyangsih&apos; (male,<br/>strong-beat) part has one note different and lower than, and<br/>the &apos;polos&apos; (female, weak-beat) part has one note different and<br/>higher than, two common notes - say the nyangsih plays nominals<br/>|: .A.G.E.E :| while polos plays |: G.C.A.G. :| - where the dots are<br/>rests (and ignoring accidentals).  With my current tuning, I&apos;d have<br/>to write the resulting melody as:<br/>|: G Ab C G Ab Eb G Eb :|<br/>to be able to sight-read it.  But in terms of 9-EDO, it&apos;s just the<br/>following series of notes:<br/>|: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|  (I use 9 instead of 0 for the octave.)<br/>This is easy to &quot;modalate&quot; by adding or subtracting an integer to<br/>each note.  Thus, (motif on 5) (motif on 4) (motif on 5) (motif on<br/>6) (motif on 5) (motif on 5) becomes:<br/>|: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|  |: 4 5 8 4 5 1 4 1 :|<br/>|: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|  |: 6 7 10 6 7 3 6 3 :|<br/>|: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|  |: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|<br/>The only problem with doing this is that notes 3 (nominal E) and 8<br/>(nominal B) don&apos;t appear in the scale.  So to maintain the pattern<br/>of intervals (as counts of steps), I need to replace each derived 8<br/>with 7 and each derived 3 with 4 - in *this* case:<br/>|: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|  |: 4 5 7 4 5 1 4 1 :|<br/>|: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|  |: 6 7 10 6 7 4 6 4 :|<br/>|: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|  |: 5 6 9 5 6 2 5 2 :|</p><p>Played slowly, the example above has enough evidence of the pattern<br/>that you can sort of recognise the fact of &quot;modalation&quot; - but it&apos;s<br/>weird.

As far as the gongsmith was concerned it was just a consumer option. (Some people like corinthian leather seats, others like their tuning copied from the Paku Buwano X gamelan from the Pura Paku Alam).<br/>And yes, I&apos;ve seem gamelan made and tuned. The bars and gongs come out of the forging process with high pitches. It is very difficult to raise the pitch of a Javanese gong, lowering is by removing metal from the face of the gong.  And you don&apos;t want to muck about much with the ends of keys, as the gender style (&quot;Blimbing&quot;) keys are already thin on the ends, and the ends have to be smooth underneath for damping.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2006 1:11:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Overkill?

Here, I mean maqam<br/>in the context of a key system of course.</p><p>Cheshni, in retrospect, is synonymous with tonicization.</p><p>For example... consider a Fasil ensemble tuned to the Mansur Ahenk where<br/>perde rast corresponds to G3 of roughly 195hz. Imagine that they started<br/>playing the famous Sharki in Hisar-Buselik by Tanburi Mustafa Chavush (the<br/>composite maqam being his invention), where the principal scales are:</p><p>F E D C B A (G#) - Buselik (Pythagorean minor)<br/>a g# F E D# C B A (G#)</p><p><a href="http://www.turkmusiki.com/arsiv/2022.jpg">http://www.turkmusiki.com/arsiv/2022.jpg</a></p><p>The Penchgah opening is unusual indeed. Let&apos;s play polyphony:</p><p>1. Play a C major chord until the last note of the first measure.<br/>2. Press a G major chord with this last note.<br/>3. Now a G minor second inversion in the second measure and quickly modulate<br/>to C major dominant seventh on Bb, and to F major on F.<br/>4. F major 2nd inv. on measure three&apos;s first beat.<br/>5. Modulate to D minor on the second beat.<br/>6. D minor 2nd inv. on the third beat.<br/>7. G major dominant seventh chord on the fourth measure.<br/>8. Modulate to C major on the last note of this measure.</p><p>The first measure was... CM &gt; GM<br/>second measure was...
