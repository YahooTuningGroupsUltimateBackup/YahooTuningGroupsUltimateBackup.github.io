According to Mahnkopf, the pitch content of the piece is derived<br/>from a fixed-register set as follows:</p><p>(d = 1/4tone flat, + = 1/4tone sharp, middle C = C4)</p><p>C# 7<br/>Bd 6<br/>E+6<br/>E6<br/>Ad5<br/>G5<br/>Gd5<br/>F+5<br/>F5<br/>Ed5<br/>Dd5<br/>B+4<br/>B4<br/>G#4<br/>D#4<br/>C4<br/>G4</p><p>An inversion of the same set, beginning on C+2 also figure in the composition.</p><p>I&apos;ve spent some time trying to parse these pitches for any underlying<br/>patterns with little success. Mahnkopf stresses the abundance of 1/4 tones,<br/>tritones, Major sevenths and minor ninths, but their distribution might as<br/>well be random to my ears. Am I missing something? Or, is this just a set of<br/>pitches whose complexity is directly proportional to the size of the set<br/>itself?</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
