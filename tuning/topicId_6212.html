The<br/>&gt; A-sharp would be a little higher than a B-flat would be, and the F<br/>&gt; natural would be a little lower than an E-sharp would be.  So it was<br/>&gt; really slightly more than a perfect fourth, and for the words &quot;The<br/>&gt; most are gone now,&quot; &quot;gone&quot; would be a little under what you&apos;d expect<br/>&gt; as the interval of a fourth, and would be correspondingly expressive<br/>&gt; in that way.&quot; (Charles Ives Remembered: An Oral History, Da Capo<br/>&gt; Press, p.221)</p><p>Indeed, F-A# seems almost like an old friend to me: it defines a<br/>Pythagorean &quot;Wolf fourth&quot; or augmented third formed by 11 fifths up,<br/>177147:131072 or ~522 cents (a Pythagorean comma wider than 4:3).</p><p>This rings a bell because F-A# defines the chain of fifths for a<br/>12-note tuning discussing by some early 15th-century theorists, and<br/>possibly used according to Mark Lindley for the music in one organ<br/>tablature of the epoch, with all accidentals tuned as Pythagorean<br/>sharps. Of course, the absence of Bb, an integral note of the normal<br/>gamut of system of _musica recta_, would be a serious drawback, and<br/>Lindley notes that the examples of the tablature in question might be<br/>taken to finesse this point by using the third Bb-D (realized on this<br/>hypothesis as A#-D, a diminished fourth or schisma third at ~384.36<br/>cents, only ~1.95 cents from 5:4) and avoiding the fifth Bb-F (which<br/>would sound as A#-F, a Wolf fifth a Pythagorean comma narrower than<br/>just).</p><p>Anyway, the Ives example suggests an interesting historical free<br/>association: and I certainly agree that a Pythagorean interval of F-A#<br/>would be quite different from a perfect fourth (at any rate in the<br/>usual kinds of timbres we&apos;re considering).</p><p>In a weird &quot;sort-of-neo-medieval/20th-century&quot; mood, I&apos;ve played<br/>around with a resolution like</p><p>A#-B<br/>F -E</p><p>where the interval expands to a pure fifth, each voice moving by a<br/>usual Pythagorean diatonic semitone of 256:243 (~90 cents) -- ~180<br/>cents of expansion in all. Somehow it seems almost &quot;expressionist&quot; or<br/>something.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
