Its<br/>importance in<br/>the Hellenic, ancient Hindu, and medieval Arabic worlds seems to have been<br/>great.<br/>Wasn&apos;t Pythagorean tuning the standard tuning for Western music from before<br/>900<br/>through about 1450 A.D., giving it a longer reign here than any other tuning<br/>system?<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>If you&apos;ll notice, I said &quot;practical use.&quot;  I am aware that Pythagorean tuning<br/>has been the &quot;official&quot; standard in much of the world for a great length of<br/>time, but I feel that that convention was honored greatly in the breach, much<br/>like the 12et convention of modern times.  For the 5-tone scales of<br/>Pythagorean times, it is indeed possible to apply the Pythagorean 3-limit<br/>idea, but when you start trying to crowd in more tones per octave, you run<br/>into problems.

I<br/>think Joe Monzo is making that mistake as well. In Chinese music (according to Yasser) and<br/>in Western music from 900-1200 AD, the harmony consists of fifths and fourths. So the 81/64<br/>would not be heard against the 1/1, it would be heard against the 27/16, for example. And<br/>the 27/16 would not be tuned 5/3 because it would be heard against the 9/8, which would not<br/>be tuned 10/9 because it would be heard against the 3/2. A chain of fifths, i.e.,<br/>Pythagorean tuning, is clearly the best way to tune such music. Sure, vocalists could use<br/>both 5/4 and 81/64 in the course of a piece of music, depending on immediate harmonic<br/>context, but if we had to choose one for these musics, it would certainly be 81/64.<br/>Melodically, also, the Pythagorean versions of the pentatonic and heptatonic scale are very<br/>smooth and easily learned.</p><p>You can&apos;t take the major third (5/4 or 81/64) and analyze it out of the context of the rest<br/>of the scale and the type of harmony it is to be used for!</p><p>&gt; Discussions of tuning theory are quite interesting, but it is also important<br/>&gt; to realize that the theory must be put into practice to have any real meaning</p><p>And it is also important to realize that this practice will occur in a musical context<br/>governed by particular stylistic constraints. That&apos;s where you failed in your attempted<br/>connection of theory and practice. When you wrote:</p><p>&gt;For the 5-tone scales of<br/>&gt;Pythagorean times, it is indeed possible to apply the Pythagorean 3-limit<br/>&gt;idea, but when you start trying to crowd in more tones per octave, you run<br/>&gt;into problems.</p><p>you were quite guilty of divorcing theory from practice. For you were applying a<br/>simple-ratio principle to scales apart from any consideration of how these scales are to be<br/>used, particularly what harmonic simultaneities will appear and what functions they will<br/>have (and to what extent the 7-tone idea is relevant when chromatic alterations appear).<br/>These factors are quite different for heptatonic music of different times and places, and<br/>to assume a single abstract mathematical rule will be relevant to all these musical<br/>situations is to be really adrift in theory-land. Also, the scales of Pythagorean times had<br/>7, not 5, tones!</p></div><h3>Paul H.

The single<br/>repetition period that fits mathematically is far too long to have any<br/>musical or perceptual relevance.</p><p>But in most styles, the chords will not consist of the entire scale but of<br/>very specific subsets.

If it were true that the entire scale was heard in terms of a single<br/>repetition period, then you could never have a scale with a perfect fourth<br/>above the tonic, since then the tonic would be analyzed as a &quot;partial&quot;, not<br/>as a &quot;fundamental&quot;. But clearly the presence of a perfect fourth above the<br/>tonic in the scale does not impede the tonic&apos;s function; most &quot;tonal&quot; scales<br/>do have a perfect fourth above the tonic.

Perceptive listeners,<br/>hearing the 5th partial emerging from the whole complex of<br/>sound in the cathedral space, would have noticed that the<br/>64:81 Pythagorean ditone (&apos;major 3rd&apos;) did not &apos;fit&apos; the<br/>overall sound.</p><p>The first mention in European theory treatises of singers<br/>altering the pitch of Pythagorean &apos;3rds&apos; and &apos;6ths&apos;, so<br/>that they more closely approximate 5-limit JI, is in<br/>the late 1200s/early 1300s (Marchetto was one of them).</p><p>This was about 100 years after the invention of the<br/>architectural techniques which enabled the construction of<br/>the &apos;Gothic&apos;-style cathedrals (such as Notre Dame in Paris).</p><p>This was also during the time of the Crusades, when<br/>soldiers returning to Italy and France brought back<br/>with them from &apos;the Holy Land&apos; the ancient Greek theory<br/>texts (such as Ptolemy&apos;s) which described all sorts of<br/>non-Pythagorean ratios.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
