If one uses 1/6 SC for the small ones, then the larger ones cannot all be pure.<br/>* I think that Young&apos;s original definition for his first temperament used 1/6 SC for the smallest 5ths and pure 3/2 for the largest; this leaves the remaining 5ths with a difficult to describe intermediate value.  It is now usually re-defined with 1/6 PC for the smallest, pure for the largest and then the intermediates are exactly 700c.<br/>* Apparently, Bradley Lehman first intended to use 1/6 SC for the smallest 5ths in his Bach temperament, but then decided that 1/6 PC was more historically likely ... but I don&apos;t know enough about that.</p><p>Steve M.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;straub@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just saw the following entry in Wikipedia - it exists only in the german (and the esperanto) version, which probably explains why I never saw it mentioned here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbermann-Sorge-Temperatur">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbermann-Sorge-Temperatur</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a kind of meantone - actually nearly identical to 1/6 comma meantone, except that a fifth is not tempered down 1/6 of a syntonic comma but a pythagorean comma.

So, a confirmation on the Pythagorean part at least.</p><p>I&apos;d guess the difference from 1/6-comma meantone isn&apos;t enough to be significant. With fifths tempered by 1/6 of a syntonic comma, 45/32 is just, but that&apos;s a dissonance in traditional music theory, so it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s near just.</p></div><h3><a id=106133 href="#106133">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2013 11:27:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hans,<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have any in-depth knowledge, but from my reading on the internet over a few years it seems as though this type of temperament is often defined in terms of PC not SC.<br/>&gt; * It does not seem to make much difference in the case of Silbermann-Sorge with 11 small and one (very) large 5th.<br/>&gt; * In the case of Vallotti, with 6 small and 6 larger, it makes sense to use 1/6 PC for the small ones, then the larger ones are pure 3/2.

It won&apos;t make much of a difference to listen - just for &quot;circularity&quot;, if you have 12 pitches and want to close the circle of fifths. For that, pythagorean comma is apparently better suited. Thanks for the answers!<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
