The first experiment that comes to my mind (and<br/>certainly is one of the important experiments I performed on myself when<br/>trying to understand ratio-interpretations) goes like this: Take the<br/>tempered chord, and alter the tuning of the pitches until maximum<br/>consonance is reached, without ever allowing the quality of the chord to<br/>change (that is, does it sound like a different chord?). Now this<br/>probably still sounds dubious to you, but as another example, take the<br/>minor triad. When I was doing these experiments, I definitely sensed a<br/>change in quality (besides consonance) when it is changed from 12-equal<br/>to 10:12:15, at least for a certain timbre and register. So I would<br/>probably say that under those conditions, the 12-equal minor triad is<br/>&quot;heard&quot; as 16:19:24. However, doing the experiment with the individual<br/>intervals of the chord led unquestionably to 10:12:15 (i.e.,<br/>1/6:1/5:1/4). (BTW, for two-note chords, the most complex ratio I could<br/>tune by ear was 17:13.)</p><p>The thinking behind this statement in my paper is a model like<br/>Parncutt&apos;s. See his book _Harmony: A Psychoacoustical Approach_ and<br/>you&apos;ll get a much better sense of why I think these statements are<br/>meaningful.</p></div>
