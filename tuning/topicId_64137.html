So either you progress very slowly or you jump out a head and hope you haven&apos;t trapped yourself<br/> I thought this post was goin to be about Brink McBride who has his own anarchistic tunings going on that really do get you in the here and now.<br/> and never knew Herman Miller had a chain company either.<br/>otherwise i would be trying to figure out how to make and instrument out of chain!</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 1         &gt;    Date: Sat, 11 Feb 2006 22:10:56 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@coolgoose.com">genewardsmith@coolgoose.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Blink and microtonality<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Malcolm Galdwell&apos;s recent book &quot;Blink&quot; discusses snap judgements, and<br/>&gt; how powerful they can be.
