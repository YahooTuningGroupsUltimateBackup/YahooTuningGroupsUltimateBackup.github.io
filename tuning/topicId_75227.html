It&apos;s a linear temperament with a period of 1200 cents and a generator of about ~357.076 cents. The point here is that this generator is fairly close to 16/13, which makes it possible to approximate 13-limit intervals nicely. What&apos;s more, three of these neutral thirds are close to 13/7 and therefore 7-limit intervals can be mapped here as well. And even better (the most interesting thing of all), this particular generator is actually the 9th root of 32/5, which means that also 5-limit intervals can be played there. So in this scale, I can, in fact, easily play chords very close to 4:5:7:13 or something like this. The one that I used so often at the beginning of the celesta part was an approximation to 1:4:7:10:13:16 which sounds particularly attractive to me because of the difference tones all of them being three times the common fundamental. That&apos;s why I finally called the piece &quot;13-limit Spectrum&quot; as it reminds me of the old strange synthetic timbre whose harmonics go 1:4:7:10:13:16:19:22 ...</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=75229 href="#75229">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2008 2:03:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>PS: As you can hear from the music, although I also tried to play something like fifths, it was not one of the best choices -- they are about 12 cents away from pure.</p><p>PP</p></div><h3><a id=75255 href="#75255">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
