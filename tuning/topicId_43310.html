Thanks for all that data.  We do have some different sources.<br/> As you said, you don&apos;t need to bring Werckmeister into your dissertation.  I<br/>would hate to upset your track to graduation. ;)</p><p>However, there are other sources.  Have you checked Werckmeister&apos;s own report<br/>of 1705 about the Groningen temperament change?  It has just been published<br/>in English.</p><p>Werckmeister doesn&apos;t mention other people enough (everyone he does mention is<br/>listed in Walther&apos;s Lexicon).  The organ builder Wender of Muhlhausen<br/>preferred to use Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.  Ahle, Bach&apos;s predecessor in<br/>Muhlhausen, was indeed freinds with W. (including things about W. in his<br/>prose and voluminous writings).  It would appear that Bach walked into an<br/>already tuned Werckmeister organ in both Arnstadt and Muhlhausen.  No less<br/>than Kuhnau spoke of Wender&apos;s insistence on Werckmeister tuning.</p><p>About winds and strings, we have just completed performances of Bach&apos;s<br/>Brandenburg Concerto #2 in Werckmeister III in a beautiful intonation.  There<br/>is no difficulty retuning -- at least to us moderns.  The string merely<br/>follow the harpsichord.  The winds today use scotch tape to alter the<br/>positioning of the keys and the shape of the tone holes.</p><p>You work in abstract confirms the use of quarter-comma meantone in Holland.<br/>But it does not mitigate against the influence Werckmeister had on other<br/>creative types in an earlier generation.  Take a close look at Walther&apos;s<br/>Lexicon for all the usage of Werckmeister.  He&apos;s all over the place.  And<br/>take a listen to Armin Shoof&apos;s performances of Buxtehude on Lubeck&apos;s St.<br/>Jacobi Kirche.</p><p>I will look into the St. Jacobi/Hamburg info again...it was something in<br/>Walther, but I don&apos;t remember where.</p><p>Ibo: Btw, watch out:  the authors in the regions concerned, from<br/>Werckmeister onwards (may be before already?) do not mix up<br/>well-temperaments and ET! The are clear and well aware about this<br/>point!</p><p>I do agree with this.  If fact, this is the root of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>Paradoxical Discourse: scales equally useable, but not identical.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
