However, today I<br/>saw a post here from Paul Erlich indicating some kind of problem in<br/>nondigest mode which caused my posts (or at least one of them) to be<br/>treated as attachments or the like, and I may have at least a guess as to<br/>the nature of the problem.</p><p>Both to clarify my unsuspecting intentions in posting what I thought were<br/>three innocent text messages composed as usual in GNU Emacs for DOS and<br/>uploaded to my Internet shell account for posting through the Pine mail<br/>program, _without attachments_ of course, and possibly to solve a mystery<br/>which could possibly help avoid future problems, I would like to share my<br/>guess as to what may have happened.</p><p>The one possible clue I noticed is that for some reason Pine&apos;s &quot;sent-mail&quot;<br/>archive says that my first message appearing in TD 723 (723:6) is in an<br/>&quot;X-UNKNOWN&quot; character set, although I composed it as plain ASCII in GNU<br/>Emacs 19.31 for DOS and it appears as normal text both in Pine and in my<br/>copy of TD 723, as far as I can tell.</p><p>My first reaction was to wonder: could special characters have infiltrated<br/>the text during Z-modem transfer from DOS to my UNIX account, or in Pine<br/>itself? If so, why now rather than before?</p><p>Then I remembered that I have quoted some of Paul Erlich&apos;s text from a<br/>post in TD 719 in which he used a character outside of the standard ASCII<br/>set which looked like an &quot;o-acute&quot; (used, e.g., in Spanish) on my display,<br/>but which I guessed must be a &quot;cents&quot; sign in some non-MS-DOS 6.22<br/>character set. At the time, I preferred not to change anything in quoted<br/>text -- but I now wonder whether, if I had taken the liberty of changing<br/>that o-acute to the word &quot;cents,&quot; I might have averted the problem</p><p>As one test of this hypothesis, I will try posting the same message, but<br/>with the &quot;o-acute&quot; character (as it appears on my display) in the quote<br/>from Paul Erlich changed to the word &quot;cents.&quot; If this revised post<br/>succeeds without any complications in nondigest mode, then maybe we have<br/>found the relevant variable.</p><p>Hopefully having made my intentions in TD 723 to post plain text messages<br/>clear at least, and emphasizing that at this point I am only offering a<br/>guess as to what may have happened, I express my regrets for the glitch,<br/>whatever it was.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
