My angle is from a performance perspective, from a<br/>player&apos;s point of view.</p><p>What would Miles Davis sound like in true 12-tET, or Louis Armstrong?  Would<br/>it even represent the music the composers imagined?  It&apos;s hard enough to pop<br/>musicians to write their music down on paper, what if one played ONLY what<br/>was on the page...in strict ET?  It would be some ratio this side of crap,<br/>most likely.  We&apos;ve been spoiled by what the music actually sounds like when<br/>authentically performed, that the reversion from paper back to sound would be<br/>seriously impacted.  And we would be justifiably upset.</p><p>On the basis of research leading me to believe that J.S. Bach tuned his<br/>corpus of works to Werckmeister&apos;s Chromatic Temperament, I believe I have a<br/>trust in understanding profound gestures by the composer, never before<br/>present (n ET performances).  Contrasts between Werckmeister&apos;s tuning and ET<br/>performances always favor Werckmeister based on heaps of anecdotal evidence<br/>(including a NYC annual radio broadcast).</p><p>My angle is that J.S. Bach speaks in a different dimension that is otherwise<br/>perceived thanks to its specific microtonal measurement.</p><p>Now, would Beethoven be revealed in a manner similar to the way J.S. Bach is<br/>revealed in Werckmesiter well-temperament?  The precision of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>monochord&apos;s would inevitably break down after Bach&apos;s death into a practical<br/>continuum of possibilities.  It&apos;s the &quot;way&quot; of music.  Other directions,<br/>including subsemitonium were long underway as well.</p><p>Johann Mattheson is another interesting music personality.  He went deaf and<br/>wrote 88 books, many dealing with well-temperament, offering an early list of<br/>all keys and sentiment descriptions.  Even in his deafness, he would argue<br/>for a variety of keys.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=17508 href="#17508">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2001 12:12:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; On the basis of research leading me to believe that J.S.
