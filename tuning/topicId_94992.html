To imagine anything different would be to invite the (im)possible tasks of designing new instruments, new orchestras, new human capacities, new concert formats. Microtonal design is a seminar for unsticking the ear and everything attached to it.&quot;</p><p>We&apos;re assembling a crew of dreamer-doers to design together, with meetings running February 7 to May 2 in Urbana.</p><p>News! We have scholarships available. We want to work with people who are very excited about microtonal collaborations and social change. It needs you to happen, so get in touch today!</p><p>Andrew = gtrpkt@...<br/>Jacob = <a href="mailto:udderbot@gmail.com">udderbot@gmail.com</a></p><p><a href="http://designingasociety.org/">http://designingasociety.org/</a></p><p>We want to hear from you!</p></div>
