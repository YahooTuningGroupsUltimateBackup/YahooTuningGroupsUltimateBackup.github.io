(Found you can re-install Quicktiem<br/>with just the midi file associations if you use the installer, so<br/>I now have it here like that to test how it works).</p><p>Also Netscape here didn&apos;t work at all, except for oen thing<br/>- I foudn I could do an echo of the midi clip window with<br/>a url of the midi clip to click on- and it only made the one window<br/>and all the clips could be shown there - but that only worked<br/>in Netscape without Quicktime, and you still had to click on the<br/>clip to hear it after that.</p><p>In IE it came up as a blank window, and if you did view source<br/>it just showed up as &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;.</p><p>Then tried adding background sound to that new<br/>window and neither of them did anything with it,<br/>though Netscape showed it correctly in the html.</p><p>Crazy things :-).</p><p>If anyone knows how to do this it would be a help.<br/>Found some examples on the web but none of them really<br/>worked with Quicktime or with Netscape.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
