My theory for the sound of this chord is<br/>that rather than the notes than fusing into a single virtual pitch,<br/>the chord sort of semi-fuses into a series of virtual pitches that are<br/>all harmonically related to one another in a 4:5:6 ratio, giving you a<br/>kaleidoscope effect. Or, more precisely, the 4:5:6 in the chord fuses,<br/>and the other pitches are sort of there in a background sense sort of<br/>popping in and out of existence slightly and subconsciously<br/>harmonizing with the fundamental, thus mysteriously enabling direct<br/>transmission of the feeling of &quot;bliss&quot; from one human being to another<br/>when the chord is played. That&apos;s a nice thing to be able to do<br/>whenever you want. 8:10:12:15:18 is even better.</p><p>Some variants -<br/>- 8:12:14:21 or 8:12:14:18:21 is sort of the 7-limit version of this,<br/>with perhaps 8:12:14:18:21 strengthening the effect a bit, but that<br/>21/8 on the end sort of sounds like a &quot;fourth&quot; and messes with my<br/>concept of the root a bit.<br/>- 20:26:30:39 or 20:26:30:39:45 is the obvious 10:13:15 version that<br/>sounds &quot;sadder&quot; than a major 7 chord to my ears.<br/>- 18:33:27:22 is the delightfully cloudy neutral 7 version.<br/>- 16:18:22:24:27:33:36 is the version of this chord applied to<br/>8:9:11:12, which is a chord everyone should play as much of as<br/>possible. It&apos;s kaleidoscopic and intense at the same time.<br/>- 16:20:24:22:30:36:33 is a bit more bittersweet and consists of two<br/>similarly interlocking 8:10:11:12 tetrads, and 16:20:24:26:30:36:39 is<br/>pretty trippy and consists of two similarly interlocking 8:10:12:13<br/>tetrads.</p><p>So in light of that, I hope you aren&apos;t going to tell me that you think<br/>that major 7 chords are dissonant because the 7th needs to resolve<br/>upward, because the strain may simply cause my feeble psyche to just<br/>snap.

Therefore, we&apos;ll go for 8:10:12:15 as our<br/>&gt; tetradic model. A possible maximal tetradic comma pump in meantone may<br/>&gt; consist the following tones:<br/>&gt; C, E, F, A, Bb, D, F#, G, C<br/>&gt; Which of the tones we finally use in our first chord or second chord or<br/>&gt; whatever, is then upon our personal decision.<br/>&gt; One possible rendition is:<br/>&gt; C-E-F-A, F-A-Bb-D, D-F#-G-B, G-B-C-E, C-E-F-A<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can apply this concept to other temperaments like this:</p><p>Petr, these sound great, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m managing to play them<br/>all right.
