But this is a<br/>&gt; good place to begin an exploration of exactly what types of<br/>&gt; harmonic relationships may have been intended or implied in<br/>&gt; the music of composers who have utilized meantone tunings.</p><p>Sorry, I have to believe, instead, that the harmonic ratios intended<br/>or implied were the ones that could be directly _perceived_, error or<br/>no, and that the more complex ratios are mere mathematical<br/>curiosities. The reasons for using meantone tunings have been laid<br/>down by various musicians for almost 500 years now, and I have to<br/>believe what _they_ have said, rather than your far-fetched<br/>mathematical theory (you know I love you anyway, Monz).</p><p>&gt; Given the fact that a particular form of meantone, even if it<br/>&gt; only has 12 different pitch-classes, will imply a particular<br/>&gt; set of JI ratios, I no longer believe that one should simply<br/>&gt; assume that a composer intended a &quot;typical&quot; JI harmonic template,<br/>&gt; such as a diatonic major scale of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            4:3 ._<br/>&gt;            /     &apos;-._<br/>&gt;           /          &apos;- 5:3<br/>&gt;         1:1 ._          /<br/>&gt;         /     &apos;-._     /<br/>&gt;        /          &apos;- 5:4<br/>&gt;      3:2 ._          /<br/>&gt;      /     &apos;-._     /<br/>&gt;     /          &apos;- 15:8<br/>&gt;   9:8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to be the basis of his harmonic practice.</p><p>I see that fact that the second scale degree is consonant with the<br/>sixth scale degree as an important feature of meantone, not shown in<br/>this template. A good meantone lattice would either roll up this<br/>template, or repeat it infinitely, so that this feature is shown.</p><p>&gt; So, for an example, my position is that analysis of work by a<br/>&gt; composer who utilized 2/7-comma (Zarlino was the first prominent<br/>&gt; advocate of that tuning, even tho he stipulated the major scale<br/>&gt; given in the above lattice) should begin with the assumption that<br/>&gt; the diatonic major scale is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                           10:9<br/>&gt;            4:3 ._          /<br/>&gt;            /     &apos;-._     /<br/>&gt;           /          &apos;- 5:3<br/>&gt;         1:1 ._          /<br/>&gt;         /     &apos;-._     /<br/>&gt;        /          &apos;- 5:4<br/>&gt;      3:2 ._          /<br/>&gt;            &apos;-._     /<br/>&gt;                &apos;- 15:8</p><p>This is an exact mirror-image of your diagram above and so should fit<br/>any lattice or tuning exactly as well as that one does. If you don&apos;t<br/>agree, then I have an additional criticism of your theory, which is<br/>that you&apos;re focusing too narrowly on _pitches_ at the expense of<br/>_intervals_. If Zarlino plays you just one pitch, are you going to<br/>place it on your lattice according to its fractional prime powers? I<br/>would argue that no ratio-implications take place at all until the<br/>first _interval_ (harmonic or melodic) is sounded.</p></div><h3><a id=31292 href="#31292">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 7:05:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_30953.html#31235">/tuning/topicId_30953.html#31235</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I&apos;m missing something crucial, or misunderstanding<br/>something<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; crucial, but wouldn&apos;t the compositional significance of going<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;smaller&quot; meantones, all the way to 1/11th comma simply<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;encourage&quot; a composer to do more modulation and use more keys<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that &quot;approximate&quot; overtone series intervals, even though the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximations get worse as the comma gets cut up into smaller<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; segments and distributed more widely??  ??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think you&apos;re exactly right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t follow Joe&apos;s logic, and therefore don&apos;t understand<br/>&gt; why Paul agrees.
