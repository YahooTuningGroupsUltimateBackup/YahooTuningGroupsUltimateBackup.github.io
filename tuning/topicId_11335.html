Would this modification<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;have any bearing on your definition of the &quot;best&quot; generator?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I think you may be right. . . the first<br/>&gt;&gt;question to ask would not be &quot;is this scale proper&quot; but &quot;is this scale<br/>&gt;&gt;proper in a system of n pitches per 8ve.&quot;  The same goes for a set of<br/>&gt;&gt;pitches described in a different mathematical system, such as the<br/>&gt;&gt;pythagorean diatonic.  This scale would be proper in a 12 tone system but<br/>&gt;&gt;improper in a 17 note system.  I&apos;m taking for granted a method of<br/>&gt;&gt;translation which I need to define more precisely.  The criteria for a good<br/>&gt;&gt;translation from, say, a set of heard pitches to a scale of n tones would<br/>&gt;&gt;be that intervals between pitches which are heard as the same get the same<br/>&gt;&gt;measurement on the scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think that criterion could help you decide whether n for a<br/>&gt;Pythagorean diatonic scale should be 12 or 17 (or 29, . . .)</p><p>&#x9;That&apos;s not what the criterion is for.  It&apos;s a criterion for determining<br/>what are good fits, of which there are always more than one.  The decision<br/>of how to represent the Pythagorean diatonic could simply be, take the<br/>lowest n which gives a good fit (since this is a translation between one<br/>mathematical description and another, we have to give a tolerance in this<br/>case.  For translations from heard music to a representation, other factors<br/>such as cultural indoctrination may also play a role, but I presume that we<br/>will be able to specify by some other criteria which intervals must be the<br/>same, and which different).</p><p>&gt;&gt;&#x9;I would propose a different way of looking at this problem.  I must<br/>&gt;say<br/>&gt;&gt;that continued fractions don&apos;t strike me as the most useful way to<br/>&gt;&gt;represent it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;hm -- see below<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;They&apos;re useful for finding a noble number which the<br/>&gt;&gt;successive generators approach, but for looking at proper scales which are<br/>&gt;&gt;members of the sequence, I find the following representation simpler and<br/>&gt;&gt;more descriptive.  We&apos;re considering sequences of numbers which follow the<br/>&gt;&gt;rule: the last member of the series at any point is the sum of the previous<br/>&gt;&gt;number and some earlier number in the series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK, why is that property important?</p><p>&#x9;The weak criterion gives the set of all possible MOS&apos;s.  The scales can be<br/>represented by a sequence of larger and smaller steps, ie llsllls.  If we<br/>define l and s as any integers such that l &gt; s, then the scale will fall<br/>into some sequence satisfying the weak criteria.  One value of this<br/>representation is that it shows the russian-doll-like levels of structure<br/>in the scales obtained.  Its also more coherent with the approach to tuning<br/>which I outlined in my last post.  The continued fractions method supposes<br/>a sequence of scales to be completed before any consideration of it, like a<br/>Platonic mathematical entity.  It starts with a generator with an exact<br/>value and enumerates the sequence.  But given my way of thinking about the<br/>scales, it&apos;s meaningless to say without qualification that the generator<br/>has an exact value.  The pitch continuum is a distinct representational<br/>frame: we can make translations from it into the discreet systems by the<br/>best fit method, but they remain distinct.  My representation of the<br/>sequences is a process where a unique choice is made at each next step of<br/>the sequence, and the last scale in the sequence demonstrates an embedded<br/>pattern which is the sum total of each previous choice upstream.  If the<br/>choice is: how many places back do I go for a number to add to the last<br/>one? then each choice (1, 2, 3, or . . . ) has a unique result in the ratio<br/>of l:s in the next scale.  The value of the generator is a result of the<br/>process.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Then we consider sequences<br/>&gt;&gt;where the latter number must be the number only two places previous in the<br/>&gt;&gt;series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Have you been brainwashed by Yasser? :) :) :)</p><p>&#x9;I suppose I should have addressed this when I started using Yasser&apos;s name.<br/> Since he was, as far as I knew, the earliest person to propose the<br/>sequence (of course, this is actually not entirely true), I put his name on<br/>it.  I certainly don&apos;t subscribe to his theories of harmony or evolution.<br/>His ascription of ratios to the 13 limit excluding 3 to the degrees of<br/>19-tET is absurd considering the fact that pure 3&apos;s come much closer to the<br/>19-t degrees, aside from being more salient in general, than the 7&apos;s, 11&apos;s,<br/>or 13&apos;s.  There are many more absurdities there to talk about, but I don&apos;t<br/>think it&apos;s worth going into.<br/>&#x9;Also, it&apos;s not out of the question that I may find it useful to diverge<br/>from the strong criterion somewhat in taking the sequence beyond 31, so 2,<br/>5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 43 is a possibility.  You could also say 2, 3, 5, 7, . . .</p><p>&gt;&gt;  The sequence with the least numbers per place satifying<br/>&gt;&gt;the weaker criteria is the natural numbers.  An interesting sequence<br/>&gt;&gt;failing the stronger but satisfying the weaker criteria is the sequence of<br/>&gt;&gt;MOS&apos;s of the pure 5th generator which Pierre mentioned, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 17,<br/>&gt;&gt;29, 41 . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The fact that it satisfies the weaker property is intimately intwined with<br/>&gt;the continued fractions I used to derive the sequence, in response to<br/>&gt;Pierre&apos;s challenge. Think about it! It should work for _any_ generator.</p><p>&#x9;Of course.  I didn&apos;t say that the continued fraction idea is useless.<br/>That&apos;s one reason why I left the weaker criteria open, to show that all the<br/>scales obtainable by the continued fraction method can also be described in<br/>this fashion.</p><p>&gt;Though, once again, I wonder why you&apos;re attracted to the strong criteria,<br/>&gt;I&apos;m happy to note that all sequences that satisfy them will turn out to be<br/>&gt;the denominantors of the continued fraction convergents of noble numbers,<br/>&gt;and conversely.</p><p>&#x9;Yes, and this fact gives us a useful method of finding the generator of<br/>the scale at any step of the process.  But here&apos;s where I cash in on the<br/>observation above that each choice of a previous number of places to go<br/>back to find the number to add to the last, given the weak criterion, gives<br/>a unique l:s in the following scale: to explain the value of the strong<br/>criteria.  If the choice is always 1, then l:s is always 2:1.  This gives<br/>the scales of the highest stability relative to the same patterns where l:s<br/>= 3:1 or higher, and I believe it also insures the propriety of the scales.<br/> Also, if given a certain scalar pattern where the only obvious fact is<br/>that there are larger and smaller steps, the simplest (system of least<br/>resolution) way to represent that pattern is l = 2, s = 1.  This minimizes<br/>the information content of a pitch structure.</p><p>jason</p></div>
