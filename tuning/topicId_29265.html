I.e. 1.0001 or a bit over 0.1 cents.</p><p>Most wave samples fluctuate over that range of pitch.<br/>I have just retested this by measuring a reasonably steady wave &amp;<br/>I get it steady to within +- 0.025 cents with wave counts of trains<br/>of 0.1 seconds.</p><p>Freq. could be confirmed by wave count of 30 secs, with an FFT<br/>of 30 secs also falling within that range.</p><p>As you see, one can improve the accuracy of FFT too.<br/>FTS does this with with peak interpolation,<br/>and one can certainly do better than 4 cents for 6 second<br/>clip in that way. I wonder if that figure is quite correct,<br/>as it doesn&apos;t seem to fit in with actual experiments.</p><p>Here are some results of my FFT experiments in FFT which I posted to<br/>crazy_music a while back:</p><p>&quot;<br/>When you use the standard FFT algorithm, it produces frequency<br/>bins, and for short sound clips the bins are so far apart as to give<br/>very low frequency resolution. For instance, an 0.1 second clip at 440 Hz<br/>gives a freq resolution of +- 10 cents - not very good!</p><p>However, one can improve the accuracy considerably, maybe achieve a<br/>tenfold improvement of accuracy, by using peak interpolation. The method is<br/>to look not just at the highest amplitude of the frequency bins, but also<br/>the two bins to either side. Then by fitting a curve to it, you can estimate<br/>where the real peak should be, on assumption that it is a response to a<br/>single frequency partial.</p><p>I find it gives quite reasonable accuracy even for fairly short notes, say,<br/>a tenth of a second. One can test it by making a waveform with some random frequencies<br/>accurately pitched (and between FFT frequeny bins), and then see<br/>if the FFT with the peak interpolation recovers them, and FTS has this<br/>programmed in as a test to try out to see how well the FFT works.</p><p>To give a rough idea - of the five interpolation methods I&apos;ve tried, I find<br/>Jain&apos;s method is the one that seems to work best for the frequencies one is<br/>interested in.</p><p>For tenth second random frequencies at around 440 Hz, it often gets the<br/>pitch accurate to within 0.1 cents, but occasionally goes wild by about<br/>1 to 2 cents. So ten times better accuaracy consistently, and most of the time<br/>it has a hundred fold improvement in the accuracy. Pretty good!</p><p>For a 1 second clip, one can get better results, typically reliable to within<br/>0.1 cents nearly all the time with Jain&apos;s method.<br/>&quot;</p><p>As you see, I tested this peak interpolation using a random superposition of<br/>sine waves, with the wave to be tested actually constructed within FTS.<br/>One can try out this experiment for oneself in current FTS beta preview<br/>(though this section is still rather rough in the layout and user interface).</p><p>I haven&apos;t yet done the wave count tests in the same way - they were done<br/>with an external &quot;sine wave&quot; generator, played through the soundcard and<br/>then recorded in FTS.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>J Gill &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2001 8:55:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m posting this more as a springboard for debate than as an actual<br/>&gt; belief on my part.

Harry F Olson&apos;s &quot;Music, Physics, and<br/>Engineering&quot;, Dover, 1967, page 250, figure 7.6 depicts some data<br/>regarding the &quot;duration of a tone in cycles required to ascribe a<br/>certain pitch (After Burck, Kotowski, and Lichte; von Bekesy and<br/>Turnbull)&quot;. From the text which describes figure 7.6:</p><p>&quot;The number of cycles required to ascribe a definite pitch to a tone<br/>depends on the frequency, as shown in Fig. 7.6. It will be seen that<br/>the number of cycles required to establish the pitch of a tone<br/>increases with the frequency. At 50 cycles it is 3 cycles,..&quot;[LESS<br/>THAN 2*PI CYCLES] &quot;at 400 cycles it is 7 cycles,..&quot; [APPROX 2*PI<br/>CYCLES] &quot;at 1,000 cycles it is 12 cycles, and at 8,000 cycles it is<br/>145 cycles. It may be noted that the time required to ascribe a<br/>definite pitch does not vary a great deal from low to high<br/>frequencies. The average time is about 13 milliseconds.&quot;</p><p>Figure 7.6 shows a roughly monotonic slope (in the_logarithm_of<br/>duration in cycles) between 50 CPS and 400 CPS. It is interesting<br/>that these findings imply that more may be going on in &quot;organic&quot;<br/>pitch perception processes than our best machinery may be able to, in<br/>this respect,(reliably) resolve...</p><p>Regarding (1) above:</p><p>Can it really be said that a listener does not perceive the pitch of<br/>a 440 CPS tone in, if you would, (2*PI)/440 seconds, or 14.3 mSEC,<br/>while perceiving the pitch of a second (simultaneously sounded)441<br/>CPS tone in, if you would, (2*PI)/441 seconds, or 14.25 mSEC?</p><p>Can it really be said that any effects of the amplitude envelope (in<br/>sound pressure level) varying at 1 CPS (due to any non-linear<br/>phenomena involved in the process which may generate difference<br/>frequencies) would not present themselves fully within 1/2 of one<br/>cycle of the 1 CPS difference frequency, or within 500 mSEC?</p><p>It seems to me that the time required for a listener to<br/>resolve_differences_between frequencies may well be a different<br/>matter than the time required to resolve the individual frequencies<br/>(without broaching the potentially more complicated effects of such<br/>tones having harmonic as well as inharmonic spectral content).<br/>An &quot;inorganic&quot; example of this might be the small (but measurable)<br/>differential signal which exists between the amplitude envelopes<br/>(measured by instantaneous peak detection) of the outputs of two<br/>identical 2nd order bandpass filter networks both tuned to 440 CPS,<br/>where one filter is excited by a gated 440 CPS sinusoidal waveform,<br/>and the second filter is excited by a gated 441 CPS sinusoidal<br/>waveform. Such a differential signal would appear within one half-<br/>cycle of these_excitation_frequencies (1.135 mSEC), as opposed to<br/>having to wait 2*PI cycles (6.283 SEC) of the_difference_frequency,<br/>(which is a factor of 5535 times faster than the proposed delay).</p><p>Regards,  J Gill</p><p>PS - Your &quot;Forms of Tonality&quot; paper is a thing of beauty.

In a manner similar to a Phase Locked<br/>Loop (PLL) servo system, phase difference information from a phase<br/>detector tending to indicate a difference in the two signal<br/>frequencies compared becomes available with a time delay much shorter<br/>than the significantly longer time within which such a PLL, acting as<br/>kind of nonlinear tracking bandpass filter (with a bandwidth which is<br/>determined by the loop parameters) processes a sufficient number of<br/>cycles of the signal frequencies compared to reliably accomplish a<br/>(virtual) &quot;locked&quot; state, thus providing an output similar to a<br/>narrow-band band pass filter.</p><p>Disclaimers:</p><p>I am not attempting here to advance a theory of hearing, or claim to<br/>know much about what happens in our &quot;heads&quot; when we compare pitches.<br/>I would be very interested in any research findings supporting the<br/>hypothesis which Paul has presented, relating to an inverse<br/>relationship measured between difference frequency and time of<br/>recognition of such differences by research subjects.</p><p>This idea does_not_relate to binaural situations (where below about<br/>800 CPS, I think, human ears are able to process left/right phase<br/>differences, thus placing the source).</p><p>The PLL phase detector model described above is presented only as an<br/>instance of a (inorganic)process where a comparison of the difference<br/>in frequency of signals _isolatable_to parallel pathways can and does<br/>output potentially useful (albeit noisy) information regarding the<br/>existence of such differences at a time well before such a system can<br/>be said to indicate with &quot;certainty&quot; that spectral energy exists<br/>precisely within its (usually relatively) narrow bandwidth, in its<br/>function as frequency detector. It may well be arguable whether<br/>simultaneously sounded frequencies (in one ear only) actually are, in<br/>fact, &quot;isolatable&quot; in a model of perception.

I&apos;m known locally as something of an intonational<br/>perfectionist to a fault, yet I have a lot of trouble absorbing the<br/>idea that 4 and 5 cent pitch errors on eighth or sixteenth notes at<br/>moderate tempos are detectable by mortal ears, Johnny Reinhard<br/>notwithstanding.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to be dogmatic and deny out of hand any possibility that<br/>Johnny may be accurate in his assessments, but I do have trouble<br/>absorbing them, frankly, since they fly in the face of my personal<br/>experience and that of the finest ears whose functioning I have ever<br/>had the privilege of witnessing, including my father&apos;s, whose hears<br/>could set the temperament and tune a piano in an hour to a standard<br/>equaled by few professional ET tuners and have it hold for amazingly<br/>long times.</p><p>I do not advance my opionion on the basis of any mathematical<br/>principles, although I welcome their rigor in substantiating<br/>practical experience. My opinion here is strictly based on my own<br/>practical experience, having spent hours over many years tweeking<br/>just intervals to the nth degree for my own aural enlightenment and<br/>education, and having started with what could only be assessed as an<br/>already unusually accurate set of ears even among professionals.</p><p>I, like most, I believe, can more easily detect an error of 5 cents<br/>when demonstrated as a harmonic interval, than as a melodic one in<br/>which the two tones are sounded sequentially. Nonetheless, a meantone<br/>perfect fifth, for example (5.38 cents flat), does sound flat to me<br/>even MELODICALLY as long as the two tones are sounded in a context<br/>that introduces a low level of cognitive interference with the<br/>perception.</p><p>This means that if both tones are sounded, one immediately following<br/>the other and there is, say, a half note on the second tone or maybe<br/>slightly less at an andante tempo before a third tone is sounded, I<br/>hear the flatness. In  a rapid scale or arpeggio do I hear it? If the<br/>arpeggio is sustained, yes; otherwise, frankly no, I don&apos;t.

Close spectral analysis reveals that drawing a bow<br/>across a string in these instruments produces a plethora of<br/>continuous, random frequencies in short, repetitive bursts around the<br/>cneter frequency to which the string is tuned. This is responsible in<br/>large part for the &quot;thick&quot;, rich quality of the sound of strings,<br/>quite in addition to the harmonicity of the string.</p><p>On reflection, this phenomenon is a natural consequence of the bow&apos;s<br/>sticking to and pulling the string to increase its tension slightly<br/>before it is released.

But it seems like something someone could<br/>&gt; &gt; successfully argue, so I wonder what counterarguments there might<br/>&gt; be.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The classical uncertainty principle is a mathematical fact<br/>(unlike<br/>&gt; &gt; the quantum-mechanical Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is<br/>&gt; an<br/>&gt; &gt; unexpected feature of nature). It derives from Fourier theory,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; basically says that a musical note, played for time t, can have<br/>its<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency determined to no better than 2*pi/t (see<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/prof/fgdp/c4/paper_html/node2.html">http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/prof/fgdp/c4/paper_html/node2.html</a><br/>--<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; equation 1).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Much has been made of the 3- and 4- cent deviations from JI in 72-<br/>&gt; tET<br/>&gt; &gt; chords. At a typical musical frequency of 440Hz, 4 cents is a 1Hz<br/>&gt; &gt; deviation. So the classical uncertainty principle would seem to<br/>say<br/>&gt; &gt; that, for frequency to be determined to better than this<br/>accuracy,<br/>&gt; &gt; the note would have to be played for 2*pi, or over 6 seconds!<br/>&gt; Clearly<br/>&gt; &gt; most music has melodies and even chord changes that are much<br/>faster<br/>&gt; &gt; than this. Thus any attempt to say whether the chords were in JI<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; in 72-tET would be meaningless.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rebuttals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The gist of your proposed hypothesis above appears (to me) to imply<br/>&gt; that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) A listener&apos;s perception of the_difference_in the pitch of two<br/>(or<br/>&gt; possibly more) simultaneously sounded sinusoidal (or possibly more<br/>&gt; spectrally complicated) tones is analogous to the process whereby a<br/>&gt; listener perceives the individual pitches of each of such<br/>&gt; (simultaneously sounded) individual tones; and, further that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) The process of a listener&apos;s perception is limited by the same<br/>&gt; 2*PI cycle length sampling window length which a 2nd order bandpass<br/>&gt; filter network (and more sophisticated approaches utilizing Fourier<br/>&gt; Integrals, FFTs, and Z Transforms) require in order to provide<br/>&gt; results which can be considered reasonably valid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding (2) above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert Walkers reply appears to explore some potentially<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; possibilities for increasing the efficiency of certain &quot;inorganic&quot;<br/>&gt; processes in assessing pitch (or perhaps pitches) more rapidly than<br/>&gt; that of a time period of 2*PI cycles of the frequency.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some information which may be relevant to &quot;organic&quot; pitch<br/>perception<br/>&gt; mechanisms follows. Harry F Olson&apos;s &quot;Music, Physics, and<br/>&gt; Engineering&quot;, Dover, 1967, page 250, figure 7.6 depicts some data<br/>&gt; regarding the &quot;duration of a tone in cycles required to ascribe a<br/>&gt; certain pitch (After Burck, Kotowski, and Lichte; von Bekesy and<br/>&gt; Turnbull)&quot;. From the text which describes figure 7.6:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The number of cycles required to ascribe a definite pitch to a<br/>tone<br/>&gt; depends on the frequency, as shown in Fig. 7.6. It will be seen<br/>that<br/>&gt; the number of cycles required to establish the pitch of a tone<br/>&gt; increases with the frequency. At 50 cycles it is 3 cycles,..&quot;[LESS<br/>&gt; THAN 2*PI CYCLES] &quot;at 400 cycles it is 7 cycles,..&quot; [APPROX 2*PI<br/>&gt; CYCLES] &quot;at 1,000 cycles it is 12 cycles, and at 8,000 cycles it is<br/>&gt; 145 cycles. It may be noted that the time required to ascribe a<br/>&gt; definite pitch does not vary a great deal from low to high<br/>&gt; frequencies. The average time is about 13 milliseconds.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Figure 7.6 shows a roughly monotonic slope (in the_logarithm_of<br/>&gt; duration in cycles) between 50 CPS and 400 CPS. It is interesting<br/>&gt; that these findings imply that more may be going on in &quot;organic&quot;<br/>&gt; pitch perception processes than our best machinery may be able to,<br/>in<br/>&gt; this respect,(reliably) resolve...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding (1) above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can it really be said that a listener does not perceive the pitch<br/>of<br/>&gt; a 440 CPS tone in, if you would, (2*PI)/440 seconds, or 14.3 mSEC,<br/>&gt; while perceiving the pitch of a second (simultaneously sounded)441<br/>&gt; CPS tone in, if you would, (2*PI)/441 seconds, or 14.25 mSEC?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can it really be said that any effects of the amplitude envelope<br/>(in<br/>&gt; sound pressure level) varying at 1 CPS (due to any non-linear<br/>&gt; phenomena involved in the process which may generate difference<br/>&gt; frequencies) would not present themselves fully within 1/2 of one<br/>&gt; cycle of the 1 CPS difference frequency, or within 500 mSEC?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to me that the time required for a listener to<br/>&gt; resolve_differences_between frequencies may well be a different<br/>&gt; matter than the time required to resolve the individual frequencies<br/>&gt; (without broaching the potentially more complicated effects of such<br/>&gt; tones having harmonic as well as inharmonic spectral content).<br/>&gt; An &quot;inorganic&quot; example of this might be the small (but measurable)<br/>&gt; differential signal which exists between the amplitude envelopes<br/>&gt; (measured by instantaneous peak detection) of the outputs of two<br/>&gt; identical 2nd order bandpass filter networks both tuned to 440 CPS,<br/>&gt; where one filter is excited by a gated 440 CPS sinusoidal waveform,<br/>&gt; and the second filter is excited by a gated 441 CPS sinusoidal<br/>&gt; waveform. Such a differential signal would appear within one half-<br/>&gt; cycle of these_excitation_frequencies (1.135 mSEC), as opposed to<br/>&gt; having to wait 2*PI cycles (6.283 SEC) of the_difference_frequency,<br/>&gt; (which is a factor of 5535 times faster than the proposed delay).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,  J Gill<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS - Your &quot;Forms of Tonality&quot; paper is a thing of beauty.

The bandwidth introduced<br/>&gt; by such amplitude modulations is INHERENTLY SYMMETRICAL around the<br/>&gt; base frequency. Psychoacoustically the center frequency is still<br/>&gt; quite perceptibly the same as it is in a sustained form with no<br/>such<br/>&gt; modulation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; String instruments in fact have a fairly broad bandwidth even on<br/>&gt; sustained tones. Close spectral analysis reveals that drawing a bow<br/>&gt; across a string in these instruments produces a plethora of<br/>&gt; continuous, random frequencies in short, repetitive bursts around<br/>the<br/>&gt; cneter frequency to which the string is tuned. This is responsible<br/>in<br/>&gt; large part for the &quot;thick&quot;, rich quality of the sound of strings,<br/>&gt; quite in addition to the harmonicity of the string.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On reflection, this phenomenon is a natural consequence of the<br/>bow&apos;s<br/>&gt; sticking to and pulling the string to increase its tension slightly<br/>&gt; before it is released. Any experienced string player knows that one<br/>&gt; can bow two adjacent strings tuned a perfect fifth apart and change<br/>&gt; relative bow technique and pressure to detune the interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;side&quot; frequencies present in bowed string timbres are present<br/>at all the harmonics above the fundamental as well, since these<br/>latter are simply the harmonic partials of the thick, broad spectra<br/>of the fundamental(s). We string players find that we can judge pitch<br/>quite accurately in spite of this relatively broad frequency<br/>bandwidth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2001 12:23:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; In this context, though, I must say I have heard music samples<br/>&gt; referred to here and there in this list claiming to use tuning<br/>&gt; systems the intonational accuracies of which were grossly violated<br/>by<br/>&gt; singers and/or instrumentalists involved in the performance.</p><p>Go, Bob!

You know, I really like that kind of thing, even if I don&apos;t<br/>always understand it...  :)</p><p>In any case, *then* I heard the music and I was *totally bowled<br/>over...*  I just *loved* the various &quot;warped&quot; classics which John was<br/>claiming were superior and other &quot;history minded&quot; musicians and music<br/>aficionados thought were the most deplorable things on the planet.</p><p>I was all for them, though.  In fact, I am, generally speaking,<br/>rather tired of *much* of the standard repertoire, particularly the<br/>*Romantic* period, and any way these pieces can be &quot;twisted&quot;<br/>or &quot;distorted&quot; really picks up my interest in them!</p><p>Actually, I lie.  That Schubert Sonata that John chose to retune<br/>[ummm, G major Op. 78... I just checked my score] meant as much to me<br/>as anybody.  It was thrilling... and I&apos;m serious about that.  I guess<br/>I just have to be in the right mood for the Romantics... and John<br/>really put me there with his various retunings.</p><p>I *loved* to compare his version with the 12-tET versions and<br/>consider my preference...</p><p>By the way, what *were* the results of John&apos;s various listening<br/>experiments where listeners were asked their preferences??  Were<br/>there not enough listeners to conclude that study??</p><p>My own personal preferance has almost *always* been for John&apos;s just<br/>tunings... But mostly due to the fact that I really am truly tired<br/>and sick of 12-tET, wonderful as it is and has been (forever...)</p><p>On the other hand, for *me* anyway, don&apos;t mess with the Medieval and<br/>Renaissance repertoire.  There I want as &quot;authentic&quot; an experience as<br/>historians can give us... and of course with Margo Schulter right<br/>here, we have an incredible &quot;in house&quot; expert...</p><p>However, Medieval and Renaissance music doesn&apos;t seem &quot;hackneyed&quot; like<br/>the Romantics.

One that starts and<br/>&gt; &gt; stops has an uncertainty in the frequency inversely proportional<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; the duration. (The constant of proportionality depends on the<br/>&gt; envelope<br/>&gt; &gt; and the statistical measure of deviation being used).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you see Bob Wendell&apos;s rebuttal to this assertion (which I made<br/>&gt; myself at the start of this thread)? He said, that in the classical<br/>&gt; case, what you are calling &quot;uncertainty&quot; is not really uncertainty<br/>at<br/>&gt; all but merely bandwidth. He made the point that, if the tone<br/>starts<br/>&gt; and stops, the _center_ of this bandwidth will give you a precise<br/>&gt; measure of the frequency. This is in contrast with the quantum<br/>case,<br/>&gt; where one cannot scan the bandwidth to find the center, since a<br/>&gt; single measurement immediately &quot;collapses&quot; the distribution, and<br/>the<br/>&gt; bandwidth is indeed interpretable as an uncertainty. Anyway, when I<br/>&gt; asked him, what if rather than being preceded and followed by<br/>&gt; silence, it&apos;s preceded and followed by another tone, Bob became<br/>&gt; evasive, claiming this was not in the scope of the original<br/>&gt; discussion. I disagree.</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>Sorry, Paul! I actually had not understood your elaboration of this<br/>question until your last previous post, I believe it was, in this<br/>thread.</p><p>In this spin-off question the issue becomes: &quot;What happens if we do<br/>not interrupt the frequency, but change it suddenly to another<br/>frequency and then to a third (perhaps the original frequency<br/>again)?&quot;<br/>This is an FM or frequency modulation where the modulating signal is<br/>a radically low-frequency step-wave (in a scale, or square wave in<br/>the case of a return to the original pitch).</p><p>In music the stepped rate of change in frequency is of an extremely<br/>low frequency (a few cycles per second at most), yet the magnitude of<br/>the frequency change represents a very large percentage of the<br/>original frequency. This is quite the opposite from the kind of<br/>modulation used in FM radio, where the frequency variations of the<br/>carrier are vanishingly small compared to the absolute frequency<br/>being modulated and the modulating frequencies are very high compared<br/>to the very low rate of stepped changes under consideration here.</p><p>Although I&apos;m not at all familiar with the mathematical rigors of this<br/>kind of unusual &quot;FM&quot;, in such an extreme case it should be very safe<br/>to say that with a step frequency that is extremely low even at fast<br/>tempos and short note values (say 32nd or 64th notes at a vivace<br/>tempo) vis-a-vis the frequency corresponding to pitch perception, the<br/>bandwidth introduced by these sudden stepped frequency changes would<br/>have next to zero effect on the pitch perceived. What would become<br/>significant much earlier as we increase tempo would be the<br/>limitations of the human perceptual apparatus in detecting pitches of<br/>extremely short duration.</p><p>In short, in my carefully considered opionion, this whole question of<br/>classical uncertainty with regard to pitch of finite duration is more<br/>academic than practical. The indeterminacy it might theoretically<br/>impose in principle on the accuracy of pitch perception is<br/>vanishingly small as compared to the limitations, neurological and<br/>otherwise, of the mechanics of human aural perception.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2001 6:52:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) I think it very unlikely that the average performer will<br/>find<br/>&gt; &gt; 72<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; easier to perform than 19 or 31.

The indeterminacy it might theoretically<br/>&gt; &gt; impose in principle on the accuracy of pitch perception is<br/>&gt; &gt; vanishingly small as compared to the limitations, neurological<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; otherwise, of the mechanics of human aural perception.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Vanishingly small? I thought you had been saying the theoretical<br/>&gt; indeterminacy implied by the Classical UP was, at least in some<br/>&gt; cases, _larger_ than the actual uncertainty involved in human aural<br/>&gt; perception.</p><p>Bob:<br/>In the first, fixed frequency case I was saying that the theoretical<br/>uncertainty is not really uncertainty at all. Then it doesn&apos;t matter<br/>how large it is compared to the uncertainty intrinsic to the<br/>mechanics of the perceptual apparatus, does it? I meant theoretical<br/>in its final, adjusted sense after taking this into account. Theories<br/>are only as valid as the appropriateness of their application allows<br/>them to be. As I&apos;m sure you&apos;re aware, theories are neither true nor<br/>false, but simply represent modeling tools. They are only as good as<br/>the practical value of their explanatory/predictive power.</p><p>But you&apos;re right. As applied to the second stepped frequency case,<br/>the statement above was not clear. I intended to communicate that<br/>similarly, whatever APPARENT uncertainties might be introduced by<br/>bandwidth considerations would not be confusing to the ear in<br/>determining pitch any more than the other. FM after all, although<br/>more complex, still has symmetrical bandwidth products around the<br/>modulated frequency (or frequencies), regardless of the symmetry or<br/>asymmetry of the modulating signal.</p><p>This following argument is admittedly more intuitive than rigorous,<br/>but may be more telling for some readers. I can&apos;t see how switching<br/>frequency in what is musically equivalent to a legato style of<br/>articulation would introduce a more confusing bandwidth scenario than<br/>would articulating each frequency separately with a start and stop<br/>for each note.

If the modulating signal is assymmetrical,<br/>such<br/>&gt; that pitch A, say, the minimum, while another pitch (B) is the<br/>&gt; maximum, how can the bandwidth products be symmetrical around<br/>_both_<br/>&gt; A and B?</p><p>Bob now:<br/>It seems that maybe you&apos;re confusing the frequency of the successive<br/>tones with the modulating signal. They are in fact the *modulated*<br/>signal. If I alternate the pitch of a continuous tone every half<br/>second between two frequencies, the continuous tone is being<br/>*modulated* by a *modulating* signal that is a square wave at a<br/>frequency of two cycles per second. Even if we increase that<br/>*modulating* frequency to 30 Hz it is still a very low frequency even<br/>though much higher than most musicians would ever be called upon to<br/>finger. (Can you trill at 30 Hz?)</p><p>In traditional FM radio technology you would never see a signal (our<br/>continuous tone of alternating pitch) modulated with a signal that<br/>varied it by such a huge percentage of itself. If we nonetheless view<br/>our alternating musical tone as a conventional FM signal with a<br/>radically huge modulation from a center carrier, it would have a<br/>center frequency at the arithmetic mean of the two pitches.</p><p>I don&apos;t see this as a very intuitively valuable way to analyze this<br/>situation, however, since our ears absolutely DO NOT perceive these<br/>low-frequency moulations as deviations from a center frequency but as<br/>discrete, consecutive pithes. Indulging ourselves in spite of all,<br/>conventional FM radio sidebands are generated by a modulating signal<br/>that is low in frequency compared to the amount of frequency<br/>deviation from a center carrier frequency in contrast to our trill<br/>model. The square wave harmonics of the modulating signal would need<br/>to be about 11 times the fundamental (odd harmonics) to produce a<br/>good square wave approximation, so the maximum modulating frequency<br/>might be around 110 Hz or more at an amplitude of 1/11 times the<br/>fundamental for a trill at 10 Hz (much more realistic than 30 Hz).</p><p>Again, I&apos;m not familiar with the mathematics involving Bessel<br/>functions that are used to predict the sidebands, but I know the<br/>sidebands depend on something called the modulation index, which is<br/>the ratio of the frequency deviation from center to the bandwidth of<br/>the modulating signal. (Boy, I&apos;m really starting to stretch my memory<br/>here. I haven&apos;t been an FM radio engineer since 1981.)</p><p>In our extreme situation I believe I recall that the modulation index<br/>would be low, since the frequency deviation from center, although<br/>unusually large as a percentage of the modulated frequency, would be<br/>small for stepwise intervals compared to the highest modulating<br/>frequency (110 Hz for a fairly fast trill).</p><p>It would become larger for large intervals, but still low and who<br/>trills through fifths? Arpeggios would involve a stepped waveform<br/>rather than a square wave, but that would not effect the frequency<br/>analysis signficantly and would up the ante a bit on the modulation<br/>index. However, when we move away from our trill model, the analysis<br/>becomes tremendously complicated and way outside the bounds of FM<br/>theory I&apos;m familiar with, since even defining a center frequency and<br/>therefore frequency deviation from it becomes impossible.</p><p>When the modulation index is low, the ultimate bandwidth of the<br/>modulated signal itself remains within the bounds of the bandwidth of<br/>the modulating signal. This is the case in our trill model. This<br/>analysis has been on the fundamental of the modulated signal, but<br/>would apply equally to its partials. The partials would multiply the<br/>modulation index by a factor equal to its harmonic order.<br/>Nonetheless, these are low indices for FM.</p><p>Bear in mind, however, that this ultimate bandwidth of the modulated<br/>signal amounts to nothing more than a description of the frequency<br/>components that switch the frequency of the tones, and they are still<br/>symmetrical about the center frequency and should not obscure pitch<br/>perception at any frequency low enough to be executable by mortal<br/>human musicians.</p><p>At much higher frequencies of the trill, I would expect the ear to<br/>start hearing the wave complex generated as a modulation of a center<br/>frequency and start getting confused, but this would have to be at<br/>quite a high rate and would not be preceived as a mere shift in the<br/>two pitches, but a whole different kind of sound with competely new<br/>and alien pitch components. The mere fact that we&apos;re not hearing that<br/>indicates to me that this is not introducing pitch indeterminacy.</p><p>Finally, intuitively I can&apos;t see how alternating tones by sweeping<br/>the frequency quickly between two straight pitches of relatively long<br/>duration vis-a-vis that of the quick sweep from one to the other and<br/>at such a low frequency could introduce any significant indeterminacy<br/>in pitch perception. This is the best i can do. Sorry if it is not<br/>satisfactory.

What if locating the center of the<br/>bandwidth<br/>&gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed related to how we perceive a well-defined pitch in short-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; duration tones?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; &gt; I believe it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then we should be able to apply it to the case where the short<br/>pitch<br/>&gt; is preceded and followed by different frequencies, rather than by<br/>&gt; silence.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FM after all, although<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more complex, still has symmetrical bandwidth products around<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modulated frequency (or frequencies), regardless of the<br/>&gt; symmetry<br/>&gt; &gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asymmetry of the modulating signal.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How is that possible? If the modulating signal is<br/>assymmetrical,<br/>&gt; &gt; such<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that pitch A, say, the minimum, while another pitch (B) is the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; maximum, how can the bandwidth products be symmetrical around<br/>&gt; &gt; _both_<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; A and B?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems that maybe you&apos;re confusing the frequency of the<br/>&gt; successive<br/>&gt; &gt; tones with the modulating signal. They are in fact the<br/>*modulated*<br/>&gt; &gt; signal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that, and don&apos;t think I was confused about anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>Well, neither would be a center frequency in the case I analyzed<br/>(square wave modulation of a center frequency at the arithmetic mean.)</p><p>Bob before:<br/>&gt; &gt; If I alternate the pitch of a continuous tone every half<br/>&gt; &gt; second between two frequencies, the continuous tone is being<br/>&gt; &gt; *modulated* by a *modulating* signal that is a square wave at a<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency of two cycles per second. Even if we increase that<br/>&gt; &gt; *modulating* frequency to 30 Hz it is still a very low frequency<br/>&gt; even<br/>&gt; &gt; though much higher than most musicians would ever be called upon<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; finger. (Can you trill at 30 Hz?)<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I can trill at 25Hz on the guitar, by tapping the upper note<br/>&gt; alternately with my right hand index finger and my left hand ring<br/>&gt; finger -- each must tap a little more than 6 times per second. But<br/>I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think trills are too relevant here.</p><p>Bob now:<br/>Well, that&apos;s 12 Hz since each note is only half the cycle.</p><p>The trill is the only case I can reduce to a square wave modulation<br/>of a center frequency at the arithmetic mean. I&apos;m trying to posit the<br/>simplest case that would demonstrate principle accurately, since I&apos;m<br/>not mathematically competent to analyze the more complex case of<br/>stepped modulation that would have no definable center frequency.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>Bob before:<br/>&gt; &gt; In traditional FM radio technology you would never see a signal<br/>&gt; (our<br/>&gt; &gt; continuous tone of alternating pitch) modulated with a signal<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; varied it by such a huge percentage of itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well then forget about traditional FM radio technology! Clearly<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; not relevant here.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Bob now:<br/>It seems to be relevant in the simple case of the trill. Again,<br/>that&apos;s why I reduced the problem to this simple case. The fundamental<br/>principle affecting determinacy should not change.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If we nonetheless view<br/>&gt; &gt; our alternating musical tone as a conventional FM signal with a<br/>&gt; &gt; radically huge modulation from a center carrier, it would have a<br/>&gt; &gt; center frequency at the arithmetic mean of the two pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right -- but what&apos;s the _perceptual uncertainty_ of _each_ of these<br/>&gt; pitches???<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t see this as a very intuitively valuable way to analyze<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; situation, however, since our ears absolutely DO NOT perceive<br/>these<br/>&gt; &gt; low-frequency moulations as deviations from a center frequency<br/>but<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; discrete, consecutive pithes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would become larger for large intervals, but still low and who<br/>&gt; &gt; trills through fifths?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What if we&apos;re talking about a 1 Hz &quot;trill&quot;? Or just a simple I-V-I<br/>&gt; progression?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>The modulating freuqncy at 1 Hz is so low, it more than compensates<br/>for the increase in frequency deviation.</p><p>Bob before:<br/>&gt; &gt; Bear in mind, however, that this ultimate bandwidth of the<br/>&gt; modulated<br/>&gt; &gt; signal amounts to nothing more than a description of the<br/>frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; components that switch the frequency of the tones, and they are<br/>&gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; symmetrical about the center frequency<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this case, a quarter-tone away from the third!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and should not obscure pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; perception at any frequency low enough to be executable by mortal<br/>&gt; &gt; human musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have to say you completely missed the point. Oh well, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; patient . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>Why? I think this simple case is perfectly extensible to the stepped<br/>modulation representing a scale or arpeggio. What difference could it<br/>make in principle that we went back to the starting pitch instead of<br/>to a third pitch? The point is that nothing audibly different is<br/>introduced by this modulation scheme until we reach a modulating<br/>frequency high enough to start generating musically spurious<br/>frequencies that have nothing to do with the two original tones<br/>between which we were switching, so if we don&apos;t hear that, we&apos;re<br/>doing ok on our determinacy.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; At much higher frequencies of the trill, I would expect the ear<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; start hearing the wave complex generated as a modulation of a<br/>&gt; center<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency and start getting confused, but this would have to be<br/>at<br/>&gt; &gt; quite a high rate and would not be preceived as a mere shift in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; two pitches, but a whole different kind of sound with competely<br/>new<br/>&gt; &gt; and alien pitch components.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This was demonstrated in Harold Fortuin&apos;s first piece that he<br/>&gt; presented at NEC on Friday, where notes succeeded one another at<br/>&gt; accelerating and decelarating rates, often as fast as 50 per second<br/>&gt; or faster.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>Precisely, but this is never a practical problem in normal<br/>performance, is it? If you deliberately introduce it in an electric<br/>composition, then you wanted it, right? so where&apos; the problem?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Finally, intuitively I can&apos;t see how alternating tones by<br/>sweeping<br/>&gt; &gt; the frequency quickly between two straight pitches of relatively<br/>&gt; long<br/>&gt; &gt; duration vis-a-vis that of the quick sweep from one to the other<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; at such a low frequency could introduce any significant<br/>&gt; indeterminacy<br/>&gt; &gt; in pitch perception.<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul:<br/>&gt; My point is that the bandwidth relative to _each_ of the pitches is<br/>&gt; assymmetrical, hence the argument you used to argue the irrelevance<br/>&gt; of the classical uncertainty principle above (and that I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; following you on all along) wouldn&apos;t be able to apply to this<br/>&gt; situation as well.</p><p>Bob now:<br/>Yes, and my point is that this *a*symmetry with respect to each tone<br/>is in contrast *symmetrical* about their arithmetic mean and hence<br/>not directly related musically to the tones themselves. These<br/>sidebands are only perceptiple in terms of their switching effect<br/>until the modulating frequency increases to such a point that<br/>musically spurious tones become manifest to the human ear. You may<br/>view this as a crude argument for backing up my intuitive response to<br/>your question, but it&apos;s the best I can do.</p><p>Empirally speaking, we can perceive extremely high rates of<br/>arpeggiation of just chords and recognize their purity or lack of it<br/>without a problem. If this &quot;classical indeterminacy&quot; issue were a<br/>real problem, how could that be possible?</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>10/26/2001 9:55:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul:<br/>&gt; Anything with Jimmy Smith on it (including two fine albums with Wes<br/>&gt; Montgomery), or Joey deFrancesco (a great Jimmy Bruno album and a<br/>&gt; great John McLaughlin album come to mind), or the many other<br/>Hammond<br/>&gt; virtuosos out there (as you can see I&apos;m more focused on guitarists).</p><p>Bob:<br/>Yeah, the old Hammond/Leslies are a great sound for jazz and<br/>especially bluesy funk of the Jimmy Smith genre.

There are the ETs where the Pythagorean comma<br/>vanishes. They all have fifths of 700 cents: thus they are equally<br/>distant from the just perfect fifth line.</p><p>Locating 22 in the upper-left &quot;sextant&quot;, and connecting it to 12 with<br/>a straight line, one passes through all the diaschismic ETs: 22, 78,<br/>56, 90, 34, 80, 46, 58, 70, 12. There are the ETs where the<br/>diaschisma (2048:2025) vanishes. This implies that the 45:32 is<br/>represented by exactly 1/2 octave, or 600 cents.</p><p>Connecting 25 at the top, to 16 at the bottom, one passes through 25,<br/>22, 63, 41, 60, 79, 19, 35, and 16. These are the ETs where 3125:3072<br/>vanishes. This is related to Graham&apos;s MAGIC set of temperaments --<br/>I&apos;ll let him explain.</p><p>Coneecting 29 (towards the upper left) to 12, one passes through 29,<br/>41, 94, 53, 65, 77, 89, and 12. There are the schismic ETs, where the<br/>schisma (32805:32768) vanishes.
