Some Hungarian composers have used the instrument as an<br/>orchestral one. Gustav Mahler required the Tarogato for the<br/>performances at Vienna and Budapest of the Shepherd Boy&apos;s tune in the<br/>third act of Wagner&apos;s Tristan and Isolde.</p><p>The T&aacute;rogat&oacute; is a single reed instrument with a conical bore, (the<br/>shape of today&apos;s soprano saxophone) rather than the cylindrical bore<br/>of the clarinet family.  It uses fingerings which are similar to the<br/>oboe&apos;s and has a SCALE WHICH IS NON-TEMPERED.  Since it was primarily<br/>a rustic instrument and taken up by folk or Gypsy musicians whose<br/>music in handed down aurally, there are few if any known works<br/>specifically for the instrument from its past. S&aacute;ndor Burka, the<br/>Hungarian master of the T&aacute;rogat&oacute;, left us with a few tapes and<br/>recordings of his interpretations of Hungarian folk and art<br/>songs.  They demonstrate the depth of his improvisational skills in a<br/>style of playing which has been somewhat neglected in the present<br/>time. In the study of folk music of Hungary and Eastern Europe, I<br/>have found a rich source of material from which I have developed a<br/>repertoire for the T&aacute;rogat&oacute;.</p><p>_________ ______ ______ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
