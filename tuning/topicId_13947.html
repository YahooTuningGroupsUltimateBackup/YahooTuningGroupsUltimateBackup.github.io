In a<br/>recent paper posted to the Tuning List, Dave Keenan and I discussed<br/>this application and some possible connections with the interval<br/>aesthetics of medieval European and neo-Gothic styles.[2]</p><p>Drawing these two threads together, I would like to show how Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s &quot;noble&quot; counterpart to Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone itself<br/>exemplifies the theme of beautiful complexity, providing a tuning<br/>exquisitely suited to neo-Gothic music.</p><p>With fifths and fourths gently tempered by only about 2.14 cents, this<br/>tuning offers approximations to within 1.5 cents of four favorite<br/>neo-Gothic ratios: 14:11 and 13:11 for regular major and minor thirds;<br/>and 21:17 and 17:14 for diminished fourths and augmented seconds, used<br/>as alternative &quot;submajor&quot; and &quot;superminor&quot; thirds.</p><p>A pleasing musical feature as well as defining property of this tuning<br/>is the contrast between the compact diatonic semitone at ~79.52 cents<br/>and the large chromatic semitone at ~128.67 cents, the larger semitone<br/>having to the smaller a ratio of Phi. This contrast invites various<br/>experiments in medieval or neo-medieval chromaticism after the example<br/>of Marchettus of Padua (1318).</p><p>Additionally, the tuning includes an augmented fifth within 1/3-cent<br/>of Phi itself.</p><p>In exploring how Keenan Pepper&apos;s Phi-based neo-Gothic temperament so<br/>nicely embodies Dave Keenan&apos;s theme of complexity, one diverting<br/>complication is the similarity of these two names. Following the<br/>rather informal style common on the Tuning List, I have decided to<br/>refer to Keenan Pepper as &quot;Keenan,&quot; and to Dave Keenan as &quot;Dave.&quot;</p><p>Section 1 presents Keenan&apos;s Golden Mediant or Noble Mediant[3] as used to<br/>calculate both Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone and its super-Pythagorean or<br/>neo-Gothic counterpart.</p><p>Section 2 introduces the practical and contemplative art of &quot;walking<br/>the gentle plateau&quot; in order to explore the region of complexity<br/>between two simpler intervals or &quot;valleys&quot; such as 5:4 and 9:7, with<br/>the classic mediant and Dave&apos;s application of the Golden Mediant<br/>serving as helpful cardinal points of reference.[4]</p><p>Section 3 applies the method of &quot;walking the plateau&quot; to Keenan&apos;s<br/>tuning, with a special focus on this tuning&apos;s close approximations of<br/>four favorite neo-Gothic ratios already mentioned: 14:11, 13:11,<br/>21:17, and 17:14.</p><p>Section 4 briefly considers some issues regarding the use of<br/>mathematical quantities such as Phi, pi, or Euler&apos;s _e_ to define<br/>musical tuning schemes, suggesting that such tunings can serve as<br/>beautiful but not _exclusively_ meritorious choices on the open<br/>xenharmonic continuum.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. The Kornerup and Pepper tunings: Two &quot;Noble Mediants&quot;<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We might describe the &quot;noble&quot; tunings of both Thorwald Kornerup and<br/>Keenan Pepper as &quot;Noble Mediants&quot; between 7-tone equal temperament<br/>(7-tET) and 5-tET. These two tunings mark boundary conditions for the<br/>spectrum of regular diatonic tunings generating all intervals, or all<br/>intervals other than octaves, from chains of fifths having identical<br/>sizes.</p><p>Of course, both 7-tET and 5-tET are noble tunings in their own right<br/>featured or approximated (more or less closely) by various world<br/>musics, e.g. 7-tET in Thai and Cambodian music[5], and 5-tET as a very<br/>rough model for the customized _slendro_ tunings of Balinese and<br/>Javanese gamelan ensembles.</p><p>In 7-tET, the fifth is equal to 4/7 octave (~685.714 cents), while in<br/>5-tET it is equal to 3/5 octave (720 cents).</p><p>One approach for arriving at an intermediate tuning would be to find<br/>the traditional mediant or Classic Mediant between these two ratios of<br/>the fifth to the octave. For the ratios i:j and m:n, this Classic<br/>Mediant is defined by taking the sum of the two numerators and<br/>dividing by the sum of the two denominators:</p><p>                                 i + m<br/>               ClassicMediant =  -----<br/>                                 j + n</p><p>Thus for the 7-tET and 5-tET fifths, we have:</p><p>                     4  +  3     7<br/>                     -------- = -- = 700 cents<br/>                     7  +  5    12</p><p>Interestingly, the Classic Mediant of 7-tET and 5-tET is 12-tET,<br/>another equal temperament having a size equal to the sum of their<br/>sizes (5 + 7 = 12).</p><p>Additionally, following Keenan, we can use a different variety of<br/>mediant to find both Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone and its ideal<br/>neo-Gothic counterpart: the Phi-based Golden Mediant or Noble Mediant.</p><p>For two ratios i:j and m:n, this Noble Mediant is defined as follows:</p><p>                              i + m Phi<br/>              NobleMediant =  ---------<br/>                              j + n Phi</p><p>As Keenan demonstrated in presenting his new scale, we can treat<br/>either the 7-tET fifth (4/7 octave) or the 5-tET fifth (3/5 octave) as<br/>the Phi-weighted m:n ratio. The first choice produces Kornerup&apos;s<br/>Golden Meantone, with a fifth somewhat closer to 7-tET and smaller<br/>than the Classic Mediant fifth at 700 cents. The second choice<br/>produces Keenan&apos;s new neo-Gothic tuning, with a fifth somewhat closer<br/>to 5-tET and larger than in 12-tET.</p><p>To find Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone, we have:</p><p>                       3 + 4 Phi<br/>        NobleMediant = --------- = ~0.5801787 = ~696.214 cents<br/>                       5 + 7 Phi</p><p>This tuning has the striking mathematical property that the ratio<br/>between the sizes of the diatonic semitone at ~118.928 cents and the<br/>chromatic semitone at ~73.501 cents is precisely equal to Phi itself,<br/>a relationship which carries over to other ratios in the tuning<br/>structure such as whole-tone to diatonic semitone, minor third to<br/>whole-tone, and fourth to minor third.</p><p>While these intricate symmetries are charming to the intellect<br/>regardless of their possible aural effect, the tuning is very<br/>attractive for Renaissance music in any case simply because it is<br/>located in a choice portion of the historical meantone spectrum.</p><p>With the fifth tempered at ~696.214 cents, or ~5.741 cents narrower<br/>than pure, Golden Meantone is located about midway between 1/4-comma<br/>meantone with pure 5:4 major thirds (fifths ~5.377 cents narrow), and<br/>Gioseffo Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone of 1558 (fifths ~6.145 cents<br/>narrow) with major and minor thirds tempered equally by 1/7 syntonic<br/>comma (~3.072 cents).</p><p>The result in Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone is a fine shading slightly<br/>toward the minor third, although more subtly than in Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma temperament. This mathematically intricate tuning adds its<br/>own beauty to the meantone spectrum, and at the same time takes on a<br/>richer musical meaning if we are familiar with its charming situation<br/>on this spectrum.[6]</p><p>As Keenan demonstrates in his article, to find &quot;The Other Noble Fifth&quot;<br/>defining the neo-Gothic counterpart to Kornerup&apos;s tuning, we need only<br/>apply the same Noble Mediant function, this time weighting our Phi<br/>factor in the direction of 5-tET:</p><p>                        4 + 3 Phi<br/>        NobleMediant =  --------- = ~0.5867746 = ~704.096 cents<br/>                        7 + 5 Phi</p><p>This tuning has a defining property exactly the converse of Kornerup&apos;s<br/>tuning: the ratio of the chromatic semitone at ~128.669 cents to the<br/>diatonic semitone at ~79.522 cents is precisely equal to Phi. This<br/>relationship likewise holds for others ratios such as whole-tone to<br/>chromatic semitone, augmented second to whole-tone, and doubly<br/>augmented whole-tone or major second to minor third.[7]</p><p>Just as Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone is situated in a choice portion of<br/>the meantone spectrum between 1/4-comma and 2/7-comma (and I would say<br/>that _all_ portions of the spectrum are &quot;choice&quot; if appreciated for<br/>their own unique qualities), Keenan&apos;s tuning is poised within a very<br/>pleasant portion of the neo-Gothic spectrum where major thirds are at<br/>or very close to the intriguing ratio of 14:11, of which more in the<br/>next sections.</p><p>The fifths of this neo-Gothic tuning at ~704.096 cents are tempered in<br/>the wide direction by about 2.141 cents, placing it between 29-tET<br/>(~703.448 cents, ~1.493 cents wider than pure) and 46-tET (~704.348<br/>cents, ~2.393 cents wider than pure), in the close vicinity of the<br/>latter temperament.</p><p>Here is a keyboard diagram for a 17-note tuning, with the octave C-C<br/>taken as an arbitrary reference for intervals:</p><p>    128.669    287.713           624.574    832.765   991.809<br/>      c#&apos;        eb&apos;               f#&apos;        g#&apos;       bb&apos;<br/> _128.2|79.5_79.5|128.2_      _128.2|79.5_128.2|79.5_79.5|128.2_<br/> c&apos;         d&apos;         e&apos;     f&apos;         g&apos;         a&apos;         b&apos;    c&apos;&apos;<br/> 0       208.191    416.382 495.904    704.096   912.287  1120.478 1200<br/>   208.191    208.191   79.522   208.191   208.191   208.191    79.522<br/>     db&apos;          d#&apos;             gb&apos;        ab&apos;         a#&apos;<br/> _79.5|128.2_128.2|79.5_     _79.5|128.2_79.5|128.2_128.2|79.5_<br/>   79.522      336.861         575.426    783.618    1040.956</p><p>As we saw with Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone, intricate mathematical<br/>tunings can take on a richer musical meaning as we become more<br/>familiar with the surrounding territory along the intonational<br/>spectrum.</p><p>While the region of Kornerup&apos;s tuning near 1/4-comma may be familiar,<br/>at least to lovers of Renaissance music, the wonderful musical<br/>properties of the region near 46-tET may be less familiar.[8] Thus a<br/>friendly &quot;walk&quot; around this general region may provide a context for<br/>exploring Keenan&apos;s neo-Gothic tuning in depth.</p><p>---------------<br/>Notes to Part 1<br/>---------------</p><p>1. Tuning Digest [TD] 794:8, 10 September 2000.</p><p>2. &quot;The Golden Mediant: Complex ratios and metastable musical<br/>intervals,&quot; TD 810:3, 18 September 2000.</p><p>3. Dave Keenan, TD 823:2, 21 September 2000, proposes that the term<br/>&quot;Noble Mediant&quot; might best fit this function, and in what follows I<br/>use this term extensively.</p><p>4. Here I am utterly indebted to Dave both for the phrase &quot;gentle<br/>plateau&quot; to describe a region of maximal &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; or<br/>complexity, and for an introduction to mediants which suggested to me<br/>the approach for &quot;walking&quot; such a plateau presented in Section 2.<br/>However, this technique may reflect my own roots in medieval theory<br/>with its large Pythagorean integer ratios and tradition of _musica<br/>speculativa_, rather than Dave&apos;s somewhat &quot;different emphases,&quot; to<br/>quote his own most gracious words in TD 813:25. Dan Stearns has set<br/>his own seal on a related kind of &quot;hiking&quot; to explore various scales;<br/>see, e.g., &quot;Re: The Golden Mediant: Complex Ratios and Metastable<br/>Intervals,&quot; TD 827:13 (22 September 2000); and &quot;takin&apos; in the 3/5 &apos;Phi<br/>trail&apos;,&quot; TD 829:6 (23 September 2000).</p><p>5. See, e.g., Paul Erlich, &quot;Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two Tone<br/>Temperament,&quot; _Xenharmonikon_ 17:12-40 (Spring 1998), at 21 n. 27,<br/>quoting Daniel Wolf on the use of 7-tET in Thai and Cambodian music.</p><p>6. While Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone should have a pleasing effect for<br/>just about any 16th-century or early 17th-century European composition<br/>fitting within the size of a given tuning set (a 12-note set of Eb-G#<br/>sufficing for most compositions of the era), works written in modes<br/>emphasizing the minor third (e.g. Aeolian, Phrygian) might be<br/>especially interesting to compare in this tuning and Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma. Mark Lindley has found the latter tuning especially<br/>felicitous for some organ compositions of Andrea Gabrieli in these<br/>modes</p><p>7. The doubly augmented major second, equal to a whole-tone of<br/>~208.191 cents plus two chromatic semitones of ~128.669 cents each, or<br/>~465.530 cents (16 fifths up, e.g. Gb-A#), is appropriately quite<br/>close to 21:16 (~470.781 cents), an interval which Keenan has praised<br/>for its &quot;crunchiness.&quot;</p><p>8. Neo-Gothic temperaments may be unfamiliar in part because as this<br/>name suggests they may indeed be &quot;new,&quot; at least in relation to<br/>medieval European music traditionally based on Pythagorean just<br/>intonation. Additionally, the style of historical Gothic music may<br/>itself be unfamiliar, so that tunings such as 29-tET or 46-tET may not<br/>often have been approached even in the xenharmonic literature from the<br/>perspective of this music.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>10/3/2000 3:04:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:Pine.BSF.4.20.0010022345410.77853-100000@value.net">Pine.BSF.4.20.0010022345410.77853-100000@value.net</a>&gt;<br/>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; The fifths of this neo-Gothic tuning at ~704.096 cents are tempered in<br/>&gt; the wide direction by about 2.141 cents, placing it between 29-tET<br/>&gt; (~703.448 cents, ~1.493 cents wider than pure) and 46-tET (~704.348<br/>&gt; cents, ~2.393 cents wider than pure), in the close vicinity of the<br/>&gt; latter temperament.</p><p>Oh yes, it&apos;s near 46-equal, isn&apos;t it!
