Intelligent adults<br/>shouldn&apos;t have to make such a list, and I in no way intended that any<br/>one (or many) individuals are off limits for discussion, derision,<br/>laudation, or guilt by association. Any comments I made were directed<br/>at only one particular set of instances, and reflected only my<br/>opinions.</p><p>At this point, as always, all cows are fair game!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
