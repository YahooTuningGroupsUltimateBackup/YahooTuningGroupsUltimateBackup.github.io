While microtonal<br/>music is, more often than not, an acquired taste, the superb<br/>performances bring these notable works to life with engaging<br/>intensity. Including cornerstone works by the notable Julian Carrillo,<br/>Lou Harrison, Iannis Xenakis and Charles Ives, the album pays<br/>honorable tribute to the pioneering talent and bravery of such bold<br/>composers. CD Baby is proud and honored to house and provide an album<br/>of such merit.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2005 5:52:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Congrats!!!!<br/>&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;He&apos;s right about the nice review, and there is an extremely generous<br/>&gt;sampling of the music available to listen to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;ARRILLO IVES PARTCH HARRISON XENAKIS SCELSI: chamber &quot;Chamber&quot;<br/>&gt;features some of the most distinctive gems in the repertoire of<br/>&gt;contemporary classical music of the 20th century. ...</p><p>The Flux Quartet stuff to me makes this album a must-have.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
