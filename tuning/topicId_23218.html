The scale gurus on the list should<br/>find ample material here, as historically, the term _scale had more to do<br/>with a _ladder of variable intervals, etc.  and 12 wasn&apos;t a literal construct<br/>until much much later by which time original terminology had become pretty<br/>meaningless, etc.</p><p>I understand that you want to use the vernacular to communicate broadly, but<br/>my question is just what is a _better conveyance of _meaning?  I know there<br/>are many many folks who would see me arguing about this and think its a<br/>complete waste of time, because everybody knows you can&apos;t interpret the word<br/>_octave literally, and everyone is going to keep saying _octave no matter how<br/>much anybody babbles on about how archaic it is, and we should all just<br/>accept that and move on.</p><p>But should we consciously perpetuate this misnomer in our discussions which<br/>run completely counter to its literal meaning?  Should we if involved in high<br/>level discussions about historical chronology maintain that the month of<br/>October is the 10th month?  Point being: we may have to use the word _octave<br/>in most situations, and if it applies, that&apos;s fine, but isn&apos;t it absurd to<br/>use it anywhere that it&apos;s etymological meaning makes no sense - and<br/>especially where we have a clearly superior alternative???</p><p>&lt;&lt;The octave may be the one of or &quot;the&quot; only universal in music. &nbsp;I find that<br/>even the purposeful lengthening or shortening of the octave in Indonesia or<br/>elsewhere, is done with full awareness of the interval itself. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I certainly won&apos;t dispute the perceptual durability of 2.  If I read<br/>correctly, full awareness of 2 and the peak surrounding it is obvious.  But<br/>this doesn&apos;t address the point that the specific syntax _octave has nothing<br/>to do with this.  It&apos;s because of 2, not because of an 8th tone.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Shouldn&apos;t 12<br/>have become a &quot;thirtave?&quot; &gt;&gt;</p><p>If it became the _thirtive then _major and _minor seconds would have to be<br/>called _firsts and _seconds, _minor thirds would be _thirds and _major thirds<br/>would have to be _fourths.  Who was going to go for that?  In fact your point<br/>proves that scale naming logic like this for intervals just doesn&apos;t hold up.</p><p>best,<br/>Aaron</p></div>
