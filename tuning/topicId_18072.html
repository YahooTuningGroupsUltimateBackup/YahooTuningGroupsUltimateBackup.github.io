I believe I remember that an<br/>actual &quot;bell&quot;&apos;s spectrum included, amongst other #$%^@$%, a 4-7-9 snippet<br/>of a harmonic series  (probbly with other inharmonics in between these.)<br/>The ear is so desparate for harmonicity, it finds those babies!!<br/>Anyway, here are some experiements I did:</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/courses/g6610/fall1999/week3/metals.html">http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/courses/g6610/fall1999/week3/metals.html</a></p><p>&gt;Anyway, I did a timbre in FTS using the partials in the<br/>&gt;Data was:<br/>&gt;176.6 hz 390.2 hz 640.9 hz 949.0 hz 1302.4 hz 1690.9 hz  2110.2 hz<br/>&gt;2604.6  3380.0 hz<br/>&gt;which I converted to cents:<br/>&gt;1/1 1372.47 cents 2231.54 cents 2911.11 cents 3459.14 cents 3911.08 cents<br/>&gt;4294.59 cents 4659.01 cents 5110.16 cents<br/>&gt;Played on nine flutes, this gives:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/9_flutes_bell_h.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/9_flutes_bell_h.mid</a><br/>&gt;Then the subharmonic series, again on nine flutes:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/9_flutes_bell_subh.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/agogo/9_flutes_bell_subh.mid</a><br/>&gt;The flutes all play identical volumes - to be more realistic one would<br/>&gt;need the actual volumes measured, which I found on another web page:<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/pandc.htm">http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/pandc.htm</a><br/>&gt;Not sure what this all means exactly, but it sure is interesting!<br/>&gt;I&apos;m surprised that only 9 notes were enough to make a recognisable<br/>&gt;bell sound. Could actually do it in a performance if one had good<br/>&gt;performers! Now that would surprise everyone!</p><p>Not in France.   A number of French composers formed the so-called<br/>&quot;Spectral School&quot;  in the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s.  These included Tristan Murail,<br/>Gerard Grisey, JC Risset, Phillipe Manoury, and a host of others.<br/>Their idea was precisely what you&apos;ve suggested above---synthesizing<br/>analyzed sounds with orchestral instruments.   They do get some pretty<br/>amazing sounds/harmonies out of the orchestra.  (Incidentally,<br/>notationally, they resort to 1/4  (or 1/8 with chamber music)-tone<br/>approximation, which has proven fairly practical (i.e.---they&apos;ve gotten a<br/>lot of performances (at least in Europe), and with big orchestras).<br/>Actually I&apos;m over-simplifying, there are a lot of other aspects to their<br/>work, including rhythms derived from this or that data from analyses of<br/>this or that, but this re-synthesis of spectra by instruments is a basic<br/>tenet, anyway.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried out their techniques myself in my piece &quot;Ooogaaah: Dungeony<br/>Specimen Spaceship&quot; ----towards the end, the &quot;generative spectrum&quot;<br/>(analyzed from an instant of a Police song) is  &quot;re-synthesized&quot; by a<br/>choir of 12 voices (all mine(:)) , and  a twinkling set of bells.</p><p>If you&apos;d care to hear that:  <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/tunes.html">music.columbia.edu/~chris/tunes.html</a></p><p>Sorry for the shameless self-advertisment, but hey what are lists for.</p><p>g&apos;day</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=18082 href="#18082">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2001 3:22:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Christopher Bailey wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;I&apos;ve tried out their techniques myself in my piece &quot;Ooogaaah:<br/>Dungeony Specimen Spaceship&quot; ----towards the end, the &quot;generative<br/>spectrum&quot; (analyzed from an instant of a Police song) is<br/>&quot;re-synthesized&quot; by a choir of 12 voices (all mine(:)) , and  a<br/>twinkling set of bells.&gt;&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve said it before, but what the heck I&apos;ll say it again: This is a<br/>really fun and exciting piece...
