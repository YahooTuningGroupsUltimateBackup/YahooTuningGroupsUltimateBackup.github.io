Since Fokker<br/>comments on a feature of this system which he seems to find unfamiliar<br/>but I may be able to explain more clearly, I thought that I might<br/>attempt such an explanation even though the topic is a bit tangential<br/>to tuning proper.</p><p>Fokker raises a question about examples from Stevin of this kind:</p><p>G      A      B   C      D     E   F      G<br/>ut     re     mi  fa    sol    la  sa     ut</p><p>Here Fokker remarks that if the solmization syllable ut were<br/>associated with C, as is common in many more recent systems, then the<br/>syllable sa (a minor seventh above ut, and a fourth above fa) would be<br/>associated with Bb instead of F. Here I would like to explain how<br/>Stevin&apos;s syllables seem quite natural to me as an extension of the<br/>usual medieval and Renaissance hexachord system.</p><p>In the 16th century, the usual system of solmization was based on<br/>hexachords, with the characteristic scheme described by Guido d&apos;Arezzo<br/>around 1025 or 1030. Here (T) shows a whole-tone, and (S) a semitone:</p><p>ut      re      mi   fa     sol     la<br/>    T       T      S     T       T</p><p>In the classic hexachord system developed by Guido and his successors,<br/>the standard system for Gothic and Renaissance musicians, the regular<br/>gamut is made up of a series of three types of interlocking<br/>hexachords: natural (C-A); hard, using B-natural (G-E); and soft,<br/>using Bb (F-D). As one sings beyond the range of a single hexachord,<br/>it is necessary to make a &quot;mutation&quot; from one hexachord to another:</p><p>    G-E   C-A     F-D<br/>    hard  natural soft         note name</p><p>E5  E la     --    --          Ela<br/>D5  D sol    --    la          Dlasol<br/>C5  C fa     --    sol         Csolfa<br/>B4  B mi     --    --          Bmi<br/>Bb4 B --     --    fa          Bfa<br/>A4  A re     la    mi          Alamire<br/>G4  G ut     sol   re          Gsolreut<br/>F4  F --     fa    ut          Ffaut<br/>E4  E la     mi    --          Elami<br/>D4  D sol    re    la          Dlasolre<br/>C4  C fa     ut    sol         Csolfaut<br/>B3  B mi     --    --          Bmi<br/>Bb3 B --     --    fa          Bfa<br/>A3  A re     la    mi          Alamire<br/>G3  G ut     sol   re          Gsolreut<br/>F3  F --     fa    ut          Ffaut<br/>E3  E la     mi                Elami<br/>D3  D sol    re                Dsolre<br/>C3  C fa     ut                Cfaut<br/>B2  B mi                       Bmi<br/>A2  A re                       Are<br/>G2  Gammaut                    Gammaut</p><p>Certain theorists of the Renaissance such as Bartoleme Ramos (1482),<br/>however, proposed that a solmization system based on octaves rather<br/>than hexachords would make many mutations unnecessary, thus<br/>simplifying the singer&apos;s task and also making the system more<br/>user-friendly, as one might now say, for beginners.</p><p>Note that the regular hexachord gamut, as shown above, includes not<br/>only the seven diatonic notes but also Bb, the step B/Bb (or in German<br/>conventions H/B) being a fluid or flexible one. Thus one way to expand<br/>the hexachord system to an octave-based system is to add a seventh<br/>flexible degree to each of the three usual hexachords.</p><p>Let us follow Stevin&apos;s convention, also followed for example by the<br/>Italian composer and theorist Adriano Banchieri (1614), of naming this<br/>fluid seventh degree si/sa, with si a semitone below ut, and sa a<br/>semitone above la. We then derive a heptachord gamut -- or possibly an<br/>&quot;octachord&quot; gamut -- of three heptachords or octachords, each<br/>repeating itself through as many octaves as desired:</p><p>     durum    naturale   molle     note name<br/>     hard     natural    soft<br/>     G-E,      C-A,      F-D,<br/>     F/F#      Bb/B      Eb/E<br/>..<br/>E5   la        mi        si        Esilami<br/>Eb5  --        --        sa        Esa<br/>D5   sol       re        la        Dlasolre<br/>C5   fa        ut        sol       Csolfaut<br/>B4   mi        si        --        Bsimi<br/>Bb4  --        sa        fa        Bsafa<br/>A4   re        la        mi        Alamire<br/>G4   ut        sol       re        Gsolreut<br/>F#4  si        --        --        Fsi<br/>F4   sa        fa        ut        Fsafaut<br/>E4   la        mi        si        Esilami<br/>Eb4  --        --        sa        Esa<br/>D4   sol       re        la        Dlasolre<br/>C4   fa        ut        sol       Csolfaut<br/>B3   mi        si        --        Bsimi<br/>Bb3  --        sa        fa        Bsafa<br/>A3   re        la        mi        Alamire<br/>G3   ut        sol       re        Gsolreut<br/>F#3  si        --        --        Fsi<br/>F3   sa        fa        ut        Fsafaut<br/>E3   la        mi                  Elami<br/>D3   sol       re                  Dsolre<br/>C3   fa        ut                  Cfaut<br/>B2   mi                            Bmi<br/>A2   re                            Are<br/>G2   gammaut                       Gammaut</p><p>Here I have followed the usual convention by which the lowest note the<br/>standard gamut is taken as G2, known as Gammaut (Gamma-ut), from which<br/>the name &quot;gamut&quot; derives. However, any of the heptachords may be<br/>continued into upper or lower octaves as desired.</p><p>In such a system, if we wish to sing an octave-species or mode of G-G,<br/>the Seventh Mode of usual medieval and Renaissance numbering systems<br/>or Mixolydian in the usual nomenclature, we may interestingly begin<br/>either on ut, as in Stevin&apos;s example, or on sol. Here I show the<br/>syllables and corresponding notes in each of the basic three<br/>heptachords or octachords for each of these choices:</p><p>Mixolydian, ut-ut</p><p>              T      T     S     T       T     S     T<br/>          ut     re     mi   fa     sol     la   sa     ut<br/>G-F/F#:   G      A      B    C      D       E    F      G<br/>C-Bb/B:   C      D      E    F      G       A    Bb     C<br/>F-Eb/E:   F      G      A    Bb     C       D    Eb     F</p><p>Mixolydian, sol-sol</p><p>              T      T     S     T      T      S     T<br/>          sol    la     si   fa     re      mi   fa     sol<br/>G-F/F#:   D      E      F#   G      A       B    C      D<br/>C-Bb/B:   G      A      B    C      D       E    F      G<br/>F-Eb/E:   C      D      E    F      G       A    Bb     C</p><p>It will be seen that the ut-ut form of Mixolydian has for its seventh<br/>degree the sa flavor of the fluid degree sa/si; while the sol-sol form<br/>has for its third degree the si flavor of this fluid octachord degree.</p><p>If a given melody in this mode requires no inflections at all, then<br/>either solmization should be equally satisfactory. However, one might<br/>prefer ut-ut for a melodic line calling for a flexible degree F/F# (as<br/>happens, for example, in some pieces centering on G around 1200); or<br/>sol-sol for a melodic line calling for a flexible degree B/Bb, as<br/>happens in some liturgical chants.</p><p>If such cases, if F# or Bb respectively is the only inflection<br/>required, then a solmization in ut-ut or sol-sol will permit singing<br/>the melody within a single octachord without a need for mutations.</p><p>(Although Stevin may not address this point, for other inflections one<br/>can follow the usual hexachord convention that one sings an accidental<br/>sharp as mi and a flat as fa, thus momentarily shifting to some other<br/>octachord. Typically sharps apply only to the note immediately<br/>inflected, or to repeated notes or notes in the same cadential<br/>figure. Flats may sometimes imply a more prolonged mutation to a new<br/>hexachord -- or here octachord. Thus an indicated Bb or B-fa may<br/>effectively &quot;naturalize&quot; Eb-sa as a possible inflection, for example<br/>to avoid a following direct tritone leap of Bb-E.)</p><p>To conclude, Stevin&apos;s G-G octave-species with an ut-ut solmization<br/>results quite naturally when we derive an octave-based solmization<br/>system from the conventional hexachord system, where the syllable ut<br/>may regularly represent the note C (natural hexachord C-A), F (soft<br/>hexachord F-D) or G (hard hexachord G-E).</p><p>Here it may be added that a hexachord or octachord system of this kind<br/>shows only whole-tones and diatonic semitones, and thus may adopted to<br/>Pythagorean tuning, as assumed by Guido (T=9:8, S=256:243); or to<br/>Zarlino&apos;s syntonic diatonic (T=9:8 or 10:9, S=16:15), or to some form of<br/>meantone or to Stevin&apos;s system of 12-tet.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
