The problem is, I&apos;m still fairly ignorant when it comes to MIDI.  Also, I don&apos;t have a manual for the M1R (I&apos;ve purchased one online in PDF form, but haven&apos;t received the download link yet).</p><p>I&apos;ve got the M1R connected to my laptop with an M-Audio USB Midi 1x1, and have been trying to talk to it with Scala, but with unsatisfactory results.  When I try Scala&apos;s Chromatic Clavier, I can get a note, but it takes several more attempts to get another note to sound.  The Chords dialog isn&apos;t working either -- the most I get from any chord is a single note.  And I don&apos;t understand how to produce a sysex tuning dump and send it to the M1R.  (BTW, Scala works very nicely with my USB Sound Blaster Audigy 2NX.)</p><p>So I guess I have a few specific questions:</p><p>- Does anyone have any experience using Scala with a Korg M1R?<br/>- Does anyone have any experience in general with the M1R?<br/>- Can someone point me at a good general MIDI resource that includes an explanation of sysex messages?</p><p>I&apos;ve been working as a programmer for about 20 years, so I&apos;m up for any good technical resource.  I also have at my disposal a Roland EP-7 II keyboard, an Evolution UC-16 controller (which I&apos;m learning to use with Csound), and I just installed MIDI-OX.  But I&apos;m somewhat at sea trying to figure out how all this stuff works together.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>[1] <a href="http://home.austin.rr.com/ginasbaskets/microtonal-synthesis/micro_gm.html">http://home.austin.rr.com/ginasbaskets/microtonal-synthesis/micro_gm.html</a></p></div>
