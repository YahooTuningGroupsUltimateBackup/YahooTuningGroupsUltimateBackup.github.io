Or I could be wrong.)</p><p>It&apos;s a question of marketing. There are *really* great GUI soft synths out<br/>there but they ain&apos;t free or for that matter even inexpensive. And some of<br/>them only run on Macintosh, which eliminates them for me. The jSYN<br/>developers&apos; licence is $90US; that is within my budget. And, as I&apos;ve<br/>repeatedly noted on this and other lists, it is best to think of even<br/>today&apos;s high-speed PCs when running something like Windows as a control-rate<br/>device, and do one&apos;s actual DSP operations in off-board dedicated gear,<br/>which ain&apos;t cheap either.</p><p>Actually, your comparison with word processors isn&apos;t that far-fetched at<br/>all. I work a lot with a GPL statistics package called R. When one writes<br/>documentation for R, one does not open up Microsoft Nerd and get what one<br/>sees. Oh, no ... that would be too easy. One in fact uses Tex, complete with<br/>macros, and edits a text file with whatever one chooses (this one chooses<br/>&quot;Vim&quot; :-), using a markup language to specify things like indentation and<br/>such.</p><p>Jon, there&apos;s two kinds of folks in this world, programmers and the rest of<br/>us :-). Programmers write stuff like UNIX and R and Tex and CSound and even<br/>&quot;sfront&quot; for themselves and for other programmers. They (&quot;we&quot; is more<br/>correct :-) get stuff done on computers, whether it&apos;s statistics,<br/>microtonality, analytical chemistry or accounting, getting the most out of<br/>available hardware in the process.</p><p>Come August, if all goes well, I will have a two-processor server with a<br/>state-of-the-art sound card, with one processor dedicated to DSP operations<br/>and the other running Linux and handling such GUIs as I care to build --<br/>even though &quot;we programmers&quot; don&apos;t need them :-). I think I can do this for<br/>around $1600 US, and the challenge is to do this with minimum hardware cost,<br/>i.e., very little RAM and disk and the cheapest processors I can get.<br/>Low-end single-processor servers can be had for about $900, pre-loaded with<br/>Linux. Throw in $300 - 400 for a decent sound card and $200 - 300 for the<br/>second processor and you get my $1600 figure. The point is that I will need<br/>something like CSound or sfront on the DSP end -- something I can tune to be<br/>as efficient as possible in memory and processor usage -- if I&apos;m going to<br/>pull this off. And I&apos;m going to need a programmer-customizable OS like Linux<br/>to tune the priorities so the GUI and DSP activities both run in real time.</p><p>The big question is: what will I do with the software? Will I package it and<br/>attempt to sell it to a very limited market with some *huge* competitors?<br/>Will I post it for free on my web site? Or something in between? I&apos;m 99<br/>44/100 percent certain at present I will be using sfront as the synthesis<br/>engine and Red Hat Linux as my OS; both are GPL. And I&apos;m 100 percent certain<br/>I will not be selling hardware :-).</p></div>
