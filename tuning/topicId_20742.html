Would it sound like something new?<br/>Or would it just sound as if they were all accelerating<br/>round a corner?</p><p>Has anyone done the experiment in a musical piece<br/>I wonder?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=20743 href="#20743">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/4/2001 7:18:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20742.html#20742">/tuning/topicId_20742.html#20742</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I wondered, what would happen if one played traffic<br/>&gt; noise backwards?
