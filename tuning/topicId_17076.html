I think it&apos;s<br/>also relevant to note that composites of the type that I&apos;m generally<br/>interested in don&apos;t really behave much like ETs or JI, and they<br/>usually tend to stand most related theory on its head. All of this is<br/>no doubt a good part of why I tend to be drawn or partial to more<br/>generalized, or non-rigid paradigms when it comes to tuning theory.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>Justin White &#x3C;justin.white@davidjones.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2001 10:29:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt; Well the LCM of any coupling or grouping of ETs would be the easiest<br/>way to have the entire ETs available as subsets.
