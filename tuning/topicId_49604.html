The IV has a pythagorean major<br/>third, which might be just the buzz you were looking for.</p><p>But maybe not. Making the IV into a 4:5:6 and trying to preserve the<br/>omniterachodal nature leads to</p><p>dorian : MsL L MsL</p><p>1/1 10/9 32/27 4/3 3/2 5/3 16/9</p><p>and now the II- I- cadence is a little flavorful.</p><p>Note that this isn&apos;t the standard JI &quot;major&quot; from the second degree.</p><p>mixolydian : LLs L LsL</p><p>problem 1, if we want a JI major triad and a diatonic scale, we;re<br/>heading towards meantone (and 1/4 comma may not be a bad choice for<br/>mixolydian. The harmonic cadences are bVII I or V- I and they&apos;d sound<br/>great). Of course, if a more active major third is desired, with better<br/>fifths, then the comma can be dialed till you reach 12-tet, or pythagorean,<br/>or you can go out the other side, but thats getting a little strange.</p><p>so now for a more JI approach.</p><p>mixolydian : LMs L MsL</p><p>This is the same pattern as above, again, not hte trad JI pattern in<br/>its mixo rotation.</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 16/9</p><p>This might work out, nice V- and a pythagorean bVII cadenceing to I<br/>may really work.</p><p>So, these two approaches certainly aren&apos;t mathematically optimal<br/>for generating consonances (some sort of meantone probably is<br/>though), but if I were approaching tuning a piece in these modes,<br/>these are the games I might play.</p><p>I dunno, poked my head out after a year or so and found things very<br/>busy, in a somewhat disturbed way.
