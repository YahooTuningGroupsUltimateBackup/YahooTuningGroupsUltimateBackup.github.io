The<br/>&gt; nearest comparison in 12et c-d-e-f or c-d-e-f# ones ear is<br/>&gt; completely confused as to what is meant.</p><p>Kraig:</p><p>I can&apos;t argue with what you say here, but by ET I didn&apos;t mean<br/>solely 12-ET.  Other ETs (say, a high number like 72-ET) can<br/>provide pitches which fall quite close to the tetrads you present.</p><p>I specifically had in mind, when I said what you quoted from me,<br/>Paul Erlich&apos;s observations about arbitrarily-complex-ET vs.<br/>arbitrarily-complex-JI scales approximating each other.</p><p>My point was that no matter what system of tuning is under<br/>consideration, the idea, that increasingly greater numerical<br/>complexity equates to increasingly greater ambiguity which equates<br/>to increasingly lesser consonance, seems to hold true.</p><p>In a sense, what I&apos;m saying is that sonance is a result or<br/>measure of the numerical complexity of a given interval or set of<br/>intervals, regardless of which type of numerical tuning method<br/>is being used.  Each tuning system has inherent within it the<br/>idea that some intervallic relations are more consonant than others.</p><p>This is a necessary prerequisite for the interplay of harmonic<br/>and melodic relationships that imbues music with its ambiguous<br/>levels of &apos;meaning&apos;.  We feel certain kinds of emotional sensations<br/>when we hear a particular harmonic or melodic combination of<br/>pitches, and with our typically human desire to process, classify,<br/>and categorize both the feelings and the intervals, and various<br/>patterns which we perceive in their combinations, various &apos;rules&apos;<br/>are generated.  Characterizing this in terms of physics, one might<br/>say that the tones themselves are the matter and the manipulation<br/>of sonance is the energy, of the harmonic/melodic equations.</p><p>This is exactly what any music theory is about.  It&apos;s what<br/>Schoenberg referred to as &apos;compositional problems&apos;.</p><p>Your comment &apos;The wider the range of poetic expression, the<br/>better the theory.&apos; deeply impressed me.  A compositional problem<br/>for Schoenberg was simply: &apos;how can I express this poetic idea<br/>in musical sounds?&apos;.  His _Harmonielehre_, and probably most other<br/>books in music theory, or at least harmony, is the search for what<br/>&apos;rules&apos; may be applicable to untried tonal combinations.</p><p>Musical examples in harmony textbooks are generally fragments<br/>from great pieces where a wonderful new poetic idea is expressed<br/>in a way which most listeners would agree is quite exquisite.<br/>The task of the theorist becomes then to tear apart the various<br/>different rhythmic, harmonic, melodic, intonational, metrical, etc.,<br/>aspects of the example, to determine what in the music is causing<br/>the agreement among listeners as to the achievement of the poetic<br/>expression.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

Perhaps harmonic entropy is the best attempt yet to equate<br/>sonance purely with numerical complexity. Anyone care to differ?</p></div>
