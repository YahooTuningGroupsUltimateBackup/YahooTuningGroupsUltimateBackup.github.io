This is very clear<br/>now... and it certainly is sensible.  It would be great if we could<br/>somehow hear .mp3s of some of her &quot;xeno&quot; Medieval experiments.  In the<br/>meantime I guess we&apos;ll just have to imagine the various &quot;hypers&quot; and<br/>&quot;hypos.&quot;</p><p>Thanks again!!<br/>__________ _____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
