An obvious method would be to use letters of the Latin alphabet sequentially for the twelve chromatics. I prefer to leave out J, so the letters A through M would be used in that system.</p><p>I also thought about using Greek letters; I used Greek letters LONG ago to notate 24-tone. What I didn&apos;t know then that the original Greek alphabet had 27 letters, not 24, adding three archaic letters that were only used as numerals.</p><p>The twelve letters I use now are the letters from alpha to lambda, with digamma (or waw) inserted between epsilon and zeta. When converted to Latin, the letters become: A B G D E F Z H Q I K L. (The use of Q for theta is a common practice in &quot;Greeklish&quot;.)</p><p>I have a special application for this in 53-tone. The note A (alpha) is equivalent to the note G in common notation. The pitches of the 12 nominals in 53-tone:</p><p>A - 0 (G)<br/>B - 4 (G#/Ab)<br/>G - 9 (A)<br/>D - 13 (A#/Bb)<br/>E - 17 (B)<br/>F - 22 (C)<br/>Z - 26 (C#/Db)<br/>H - 31 (D)<br/>Q - 35 (D#/Eb)<br/>I - 39 (E)<br/>K - 44 (F)<br/>L - 48 (F#/Gb)</p><p>Note the equivalents of common B and E are a comma flat, so that they&apos;re closer to JI.</p><p>To raise a note a comma, use the Greek numeral marker, which resembles an apostrophe after the letter: E = 17, E&apos; = 18. For lowering a note, the lower numeral symbol is placed before the letter, or an ASCII comma before the letter: ,E = 16.</p><p>This is useful for 41-tone and 72-tone as well, but I haven&apos;t worked out this notation for meantones yet. I&apos;d also like to come up with a staff notation for this. Because I&apos;d like music in this notation to be easily read by people who speak and read languages written both from left to right (anything using Latin or Cyrillic; also Greek, Armenian, Thai, Georgian, the languages of India, and modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean) and from right to left (anything using Arabic; also Hebrew and Syriac), I have a vertical staff in mind. Like guitar chord tablature.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div>
