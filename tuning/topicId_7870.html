Over the weekend I spotted two<br/>Yamaha TX81Zs for sale.  I believe they are $75 each.  They&apos;re at the Guitar<br/>Showcase consignment shop, 3090 S Bascom Ave, San Jose (California).</p><p>As you might recall from previous discussions here, the TX81Z is a nice<br/>little 8-voice polyphonic FM box, really super for anyone doing anything with<br/>tunings.  If you have a PC and download Scala free from the web they&apos;re<br/>incredibly easy to tune, full keyboard.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
