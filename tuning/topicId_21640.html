Many of these are composers who have since<br/>&lt;contributed to its development in order to develop their own<br/>&lt;creative work.<br/>&lt;<br/>&lt;It&apos;s a bit like Harry Partch (or Kraig Grady or Ron George<br/>&lt;or Bill Wesley) building their instruments and then giving<br/>&lt;them away so everyone can benefit from their ideas. Imagine<br/>&lt;if one of these guys gave you one of their instruments as a<br/>&lt;gift -- a gift that represented their own unique commitment<br/>&lt;to composing music -- and your only response was &quot;it&apos;s too<br/>&lt;complicated. I can&apos;t use it. But please fix it for me so I<br/>&lt;too can use it&quot;. I sure know how I&apos;d feel! (Boulez meets<br/>&lt;Harry !#@#!) ouch!</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;This is the best option if you don&apos;t want to, as Jon Szanto so aptly<br/>&gt;puts it, &quot;fart around with batch files, path environments,<br/>&gt;and all that&quot;. A musician needs to spend time doing<br/>&gt;something productive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Curiously enough the use of a generic text-editor doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;seem to stop users on this list from spending hours upon<br/>&gt;hours producing email. Yet the time spent doing that might<br/>&gt;otherwise be spent learning from the dozens upon dozens of<br/>&gt;text examples supplied by Richard Boulanger in the Csound<br/>&gt;book. You&apos;ll be amazed how playing with these using only<br/>&gt;cut-and-paste in a generic text editor can be quite<br/>&gt;satisfying. Not quite as seductive as doing email, but<br/>&gt;satisfying nonetheless and a far more useful investment of a<br/>&gt;musician&apos;s time. Only by doing this will Csound users<br/>&gt;develop a basic understanding of these tools in the same way<br/>&gt;that the skills of violin playing are learned. User<br/>&gt;friendliness has more to do with the way McDonald&apos;s treats<br/>&gt;its customers than the way the violin has served the world&apos;s<br/>&gt;music.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>You said a mouthful Greg. I have played with Csound on and off, and<br/>while I have not produced any real music with it, I have learned to make<br/>it do simple things I want. It takes no more time to learn to make<br/>Csound make a good clean simple sound than it does to learn to make a<br/>physical instrument make a good clean simple sound. It takes far less<br/>time to learn to make Csound make astonishing sounds than to learn to<br/>make an instrument do the same.</p><p>I started by taking orc and sco files one by one, seeing which ones<br/>worked to make simple tones, and then modifying these little by little<br/>to see what the changes did. I then started modifying more complex orc<br/>and sco files, using first changes that I knew, then unfamiliar ones. If<br/>this type of learning works for you, I guarantee you can learn Csound.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
