The RIAA wants to put <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> out of business,<br/>and makes no secret of this desire.</p><p>The RIAA is, so far, succeeding, and they are going for restitution<br/>that, if successful, would put <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> out of business through huge<br/>fines. (They are asking, now, for $6 billion in damages)</p><p>There goes the &quot;Tuning Punks&quot; and all the other &quot;alternative&quot; .mp3&apos;s we<br/>have had the pleasure to listen to of late...</p><p>Frankly, I believe <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> idiotically got into this mess by involvement<br/>with the &quot;commercial labels&quot; in the first place...  Originally, it was a<br/>service for the &quot;under-exposed&quot; artists.. AND IT WAS MAKING GOOD MONEY!<br/>They made money through advertising and through the sales of what they<br/>term &quot;DAM-CDs&quot; -- CDs assembled by the artists and sold by <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>.</p><p>They had to RUIN it all by starting a new service called &quot;<a href="http://My.mp3.com">My.mp3.com</a>&quot;<br/>where COMMERICAL recordings could be accessed by users.  To do this,<br/>they &quot;illegally&quot; copied THOUSANDS (more than 80,000!) copyrighted CDs to<br/>their computer servers with no permission or license.  I&apos;m not certain<br/>whose bright idea this one was... but he or they certainly have a<br/>limited experience with the recording industry or copyright law.</p><p>So now, ALL is in jeopardy.  Will <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> survive??  It is now very<br/>questionable.  I&apos;m not certain that anything can be done by anyone not<br/>involved in the lawsuit... (??)</p><p>Perhaps EVENTUALLY someone will &quot;take up this slack&quot; if <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> goes<br/>&quot;belly up,&quot; but it just shows one more instance of great ideas that are<br/>RUINED by misplaced hubris and commercialism...</p><p>This post is about TUNING, since there is LOTS of alternate tuning on<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>... on John Starrett&apos;s great Tuning Punks site, on Dan Stern&apos;s<br/>fine microtonal guitar site, and on many others...</p><p>____________ _____ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=9848 href="#9848">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

In fact, the suit is against the <a href="http://my.mp3.com">my.mp3.com</a> setup.</p><p>Hell, it&apos;s a dot-com company -- it will go under on it&apos;s own! :)</p><p>&gt;The RIAA is, so far, succeeding, and they are going for restitution<br/>&gt;that, if successful, would put <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> out of business through huge<br/>&gt;fines.

Sometimes we have to take other issues into account. I&apos;m not saying which way I fall on this issue with regard to <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>, but I do not side with the &quot;all music/art/photos/etc should be free&quot; -- unless the original artist wants it that way.</p><p>&gt;Frankly, I believe <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> idiotically got into this mess by involvement<br/>&gt;with the &quot;commercial labels&quot; in the first place...

Nothing wrong with that at all. The convenience and central locale of a place like <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> will be missed, but should be able to be duplicated somewhere.
