Let us reflect, in proper<br/>perspective, on any note as a part of improvisation of a raga:</p><p>The situation here is quite unlike that in tuning/temperament. Here,<br/>any particular note of a raga is in close relationship with</p><p>(i) the note from which it is reached.<br/>    In our example, Ni, in the phrase like Dha-Ni-Dha, may not have<br/>the same pitch, as it would have in Sa&apos;-Ni-Sa&apos;. I suspect that the<br/>pitch of Ni in the former case could be a &apos;trifle&apos; lower than that in<br/>the second case. Even if the phrase is Ni --&gt; Dha, I guess Ni would<br/>tend to lower itself, because Dha is ati-komal, and so the Dha-Ni<br/>distance is much larger than usual.</p><p>(ii) Whether the note is a leading note. In our example, Ni is. When<br/>we glide from Ni to Sa&apos; (higher octave), we may be stretching Ni<br/>beyond its normal location. Not only that, we may even be raising the<br/>Sa&apos; beyond its &quot;octave doubling&quot; value, perhaps to fall, for a<br/>moment, into the 3:2 cycle value [higher by 81/80?]</p><p>Going back to Todi, the most common pattern is ati-komal Dha, to Ni,<br/>back to ati-komal Dha. This could lower the Ni. The raga Multani has<br/>the same notes as those of Todi, but Multani, when ascending, goes Pa<br/>to Ni to Sa&apos;. In Multani, Dha (komal, not ati-komal) is taken only<br/>descsnding and very sparingly used. This is one way how the two raga-<br/>s with the same notes, differ widely in their aesthetics.</p><p>To conclude, for tuning/temperament, we can assign 15/8 to Ni,<br/>without taking into account the shifts which may be taking place, as<br/>speculated above. Please let me have your input.</p><p>Thanking you for your time, and with regards<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
