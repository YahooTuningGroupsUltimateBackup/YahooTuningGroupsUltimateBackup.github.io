I work 50 hrs/wk<br/>at Apple, my wife works 50 hrs/wk at 23andme, we have a<br/>2-year-old, and no friends or family in the area.  We live<br/>in a 900-sq.-ft home with no sound insulation at all.  My<br/>MIDI setup is in the bedroom where my wife sleeps, starting<br/>at 9pm every night.  I&apos;m not sure when I&apos;m supposed to be<br/>making music, or doing theory.  Actually I&apos;ve spent more<br/>time working on music than theory in the last 2 months.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=73224 href="#73224">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Thompson &#x3C;microtonaldan@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2007 7:55:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t have a problem with the existing lists, provided everyone<br/>makes a reasonable effort to be polite. They do a good job of filling<br/>certain needs. I think it&apos;s great that we have so many theorists.<br/>It&apos;s just easy for other interests and needs to get overwhelmed by<br/>long theoretical discussions. If any one wants to start a small,<br/>private, group for discussing making music and maybe posting things<br/>you don&apos;t want to share with the general public, then I would be<br/>interested. A more open group may also be a good idea, but it might<br/>be better to see if we can improve the MMM list first.</p><p>We should probably give more thought to how we present our music and<br/>ourselves to the general public. It&apos;s easy to see how people could be<br/>turned off by the lists, especially if they only have a casual<br/>interest. I have often considered the possibilities of having a<br/>community microtonal blog that is primarily for the general public.<br/>The posts could be limited to descriptions and links to music. This<br/>would make it easy for the public to access new microtonal music<br/>without wading through long theoretical debates.</p><p>I would be willing to start such a blog if there is enough interest<br/>from other composers. I&apos;m also happy to support that kind of effort<br/>if someone else wants to take control of the project.</p></div><h3><a id=73225 href="#73225">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2007 10:06:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I would be willing to start such a blog if there is enough interest<br/>&gt; from other composers.

If you fail to post a new piece within a month of<br/>&gt; your warning, you will be barred the ability to post UNTIL you have<br/>&gt; new music.<br/>&gt; 3) You cannot post unless it is to link to a piece of your music,<br/>&gt; explain or otherwise discuss a piece of your music that you have<br/>&gt; already linked to, or discuss specifically a piece of music that<br/>&gt; someone else has posted.<br/>&gt; 4) All mention of theory and/or instrument design MUST be directly<br/>&gt; related to a specific piece of music under discussion--no talk of<br/>&gt; tunings in general, there are already at least three other forums<br/>&gt; where you can indulge in that.<br/>&gt; 5) Moderators must rule with an iron fist!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But alas, I think you are right, Aaron: it would be horribly<br/>&gt; unpopular.  I&apos;ve seen no evidence that there are more than a handful<br/>&gt; of microtonalists in these online communities interested in *gasp*<br/>&gt; focusing their energies on MAKING MUSIC.

I think most of us are here because of an interest in music. We might not all be super-prolific writers; some of us may only be listeners, but the subject interests us. Some of us even try to contribute some bits of music from time to time. But you can&apos;t expect everyone to have the amount of time it takes to contribute new music frequently.

It may not always get as many comments as pointless arguments about which temperament a particular composer really had in mind, but in the end, the music is what all these ideas are trying to support.
