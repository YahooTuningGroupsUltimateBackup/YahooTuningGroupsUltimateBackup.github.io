This is<br/>the case with Young.</p><p>Anton Kellner&apos;s proposed &apos;JS Bach&apos; temperament has two kinds of<br/>fifth (seven pure and five 1/5th P. flat), but the tempered fifths<br/>do not all occur together on the chain.  C-G-D-A-E are tempered,<br/>E-B is pure, B-F# is tempered, and then F#--C are pure.  This<br/>pattern is found on Bach&apos;s seal, according to Kellner&apos;s web site.</p><p>More than you asked, I realize,</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
