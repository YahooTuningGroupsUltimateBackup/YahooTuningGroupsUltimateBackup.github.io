This question of microtonal support came up in the<br/>microtonal composer community.</p><p>Unfortunately I (and probably everyone on the microtonal lists I&apos;ve copied<br/>) will not be purchasing the upgrade because this feature has been removed.<br/>If I am forced to up grade to Z3ta+ 2 w/o microtonal support in a future<br/>Sonar upgrade I&apos;d have to seriously consider if I would want to &quot;upgrade&quot;<br/>Sonar as well.</p><p>Z3TA+ has for a long time been a favorite of microtonal composers because it<br/>had native microtonal retuning support. It is unfortunate (and perplexing)<br/>that it has been removed.<br/> Perhaps everyone I have copied will join the forum and request it.</p><p>Removal of microtonal capabilities is kind of odd because, with the<br/>exception of East-West, microtonal capabilities have been being added to an<br/>increasing number of software (and hardware) synthesizers and samplers.<br/>Logic and I believe Melodyne actually have microtonal capability built in to<br/>the DAW.</p><p>I hope, also, that Cakewalk is not considering removing the ability to score<br/>music in Sonar via music staffs as well. That would also be tragic. I seem<br/>to remember the question in the survey I took a few weeks ago.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Jul 11, 2011 at 5:56 PM, Cakewalk Customer Service &lt;<br/>CakewalkCustomerService@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello Chris, ****<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ** **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for contacting Cakewalk.****<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ** **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, this feature has been eliminated because of the new<br/>&gt; architecture.
