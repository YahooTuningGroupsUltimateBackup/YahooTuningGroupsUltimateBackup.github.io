I&apos;ll give more lead time next time.  [I think it still can be<br/>corrected...]</p><p>Also, Paul, thanks for your INCREDIBLY THOROUGH analysis of practically<br/>every single topic to appear on this list (!!)  It&apos;s amazing.  Some of<br/>these posts were from a few weeks ago (!)  I also appreciate the response<br/>concerning the tuning websites...</p><p>In any case, here is the rewrite...  I&apos;m hoping this is more accurate (??!)</p><p>Any closed space, in this case the throat cavity, contains certain defined<br/>acoustical properties.  If set to vibrate or make a sound, there are<br/>certain tones that are naturally produced, depending on shape and size of<br/>the space.  In addition to the &quot;fundamental&quot; note, there are &quot;overtones,&quot;<br/>multiples of the basic frequency that &quot;go along for the ride.&quot;  These<br/>&quot;little sounds&quot; of higher frequency are at multiples of the fundamental<br/>frequency.  They are always there in any vibrating space or produced sound,<br/>unless it is the rare vibration that is so precise and pure that no<br/>overtones come along with it.  Such sounds are generally pretty dull.</p><p>It so happens that pitches made by the vocal cords also set up their OWN<br/>series of overtones, at simple, integer relations to the basic vocal pitch.<br/> These are in addition to the set of resonating overtones in the throat<br/>cavity.  It is the tradition of the Tuvan throat singers, mostly through<br/>changing the size of the vocal cavity with the tongue, to adjust the throat<br/>so that the overtones from the resonating vocal cavity ALIGN in simple<br/>harmonic ratios with the overtones of the vocal cords.  When this happens<br/>there is magic -- the simple-ratio harmonics of the voice are strongly<br/>enforced, resulting in a disembodied &quot;whistling&quot; effect that sounds quite a<br/>bit different from anything we would expect to hear coming from a human<br/>mouth.</p><p>Thanks!  and any further comments are greatly appreciated!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Bach owned a large collection of instruments, some<br/>obviously for personal or family use, but many for rental, from which<br/>he added to his income.  A keyboard virtuoso and competent violist<br/>and violinist, there is, however, no evidence that he actually played<br/>lute.</p><p>The use of the lute (or viola da gamba), with tied frets, does not<br/>necessarily imply equal temperament.  Mark Lindley&apos;s Lutes, Viols, &amp;<br/>Temeraments is certainly a place to begin investigating this topic,<br/>and the earlier history of the lute, fretted or unfretted, and with<br/>its deep connections to the ud is fascinating.</p><p>djw</p></div><h3>djwolf_frankfurt &#x3C;djwolf@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2008 11:35:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As food for thought, here&apos;s a modern lute builder/player who says he<br/>&gt; prefers putting his into 1/6th comma:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.wadsworth-lutes.co.uk/frets.htm">http://www.wadsworth-lutes.co.uk/frets.htm</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>Any of the meantone-like temperaments frets beautifully with straight<br/>frets, but the viol consort presents some problems in accomodating<br/>both the bass/treble and the tenor.
