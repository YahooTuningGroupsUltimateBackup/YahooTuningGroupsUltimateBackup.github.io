The methods Plomp&amp;Levelt, Kameoka&amp;Kuriyagawa(sp?) and<br/>Sethares use are all dualistic, so there&apos;s no distinction between otonal<br/>and utonal.  That&apos;s mathematically provable: they&apos;re all a sum over all<br/>pairs of partials.  It follows from the original experiments using pairs<br/>of sine waves.  So if you don&apos;t believe in dualism, they can&apos;t be a<br/>complete description of consonance (but hey, what&apos;s new?)</p><p>                                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=23945 href="#23945">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 1:20:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;The problem Sethares and I were finding was that, depending on the<br/>decibel<br/>&gt; &gt;level you assumed (yes, by &quot;amplitude&quot; Sethares really<br/>means &quot;decibel<br/>&gt; &gt;level&quot;), you can get a wildly different dissonance curve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is not too surprising, since non-linear effects in the ear<br/>would<br/>&gt; create more complex (percieved) spectra---of course, so does playing<br/>&gt; acoustic instruments loudly.</p><p>Ironically, though, Sethares&apos;s formula does _not_ take these non-<br/>linear effects into account -- and the non-linear effects in question<br/>are completely at odds with Sethares&apos;s results when comparing otonal<br/>and utonal chords.</p></div>
