It originally appeared in _Revolt In the Arts_ (ed. by Oliver<br/>M. Saylor, Coward-McCann, 1933).  When I began to read this passage, given<br/>who had written it, it didn&apos;t make any sense -- until I got to the end.<br/>Then all of a sudden it hit me, and a whole nest of possible contemporary<br/>relationships came to mind.</p><p>&quot;As for further esthetic developments in musical composition, American<br/>composers may in time use quarter notes, but then so will Europe use<br/>quarter notes.  Eventually our ears will become sensitive to  a much finer<br/>degree than they were a hundred, fifty or twenty-five years ago.  Music<br/>deemed ugly then is accepted without question today.  It stands to reason,<br/>therefore, that composers will continue to alter their language.  That<br/>might lead to anything.  They have been writing already in two<br/>keys.  There is no reason why they will not go further and ask us to<br/>recognize quarter or sixteenth notes.  Such notes, whether written or not,<br/>are used all the time, only we are not conscious of them.  In India they<br/>use quarter tones and, I believe, consciously.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;From &quot;The Composer In the Machine Age&quot;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;by George Gershwin</p><p>Beyond this squinting into a microtonal future, some on this list may also<br/>be interested to know that, not only were GG and Schoenberg tennis buddies<br/>in Hollywood who gossiped about Edward G. Robinson between sets, GG<br/>actually *liked* Schoenberg&apos;s music -- *including* the serial works --<br/>though the serialist who probably influenced him most was Berg.  Every<br/>time I look at Gershwin&apos;s oil portrait of Schoenberg I start fantasizing<br/>the most deliciously bizarre shop talk between them.</p><p>History isn&apos;t as tidy as we&apos;d like it to be.</p><p>Steve Soderberg</p></div>
