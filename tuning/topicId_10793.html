I<br/>feel like that frequently myself... I wish it only applied to TUNING!</p><p>Adam Bushell wrote in TD. 682:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ver been lurking for a week or two, scouring the many messages for<br/>&gt; things I understand and occasionally they come up. Sadly I simply don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have the knowledge and background to really gain from this list yet.</p><p>I seriously doubt this is the case.  Maybe it&apos;s just some of the<br/>messages you have been reading.  I have been diligently attempting to<br/>&quot;dumb down&quot; the list, but apparently have not been doing a good enough<br/>job of it...</p><p>I would say you should try to read even the messages you consider<br/>&quot;opaque.&quot;  You will be surprised at what you will find.  Eventually some<br/>of it... terms, etc. will seep in almost by osmosis!  Then, parts of it<br/>will fall into place.</p><p>In fact, I believe that is part of the &quot;seduction&quot; of this list --<br/>things start coming together for people and there is a great personal<br/>satisfaction when that happens!</p><p>Certainly do not unsubscribe.  There are many helpful people here who<br/>will come to the fore to assist... I see they already have.</p><p>Paul Erlich is certainly right about my own case.  Although I know it<br/>has seemed like years to some, I actually have been on this list for<br/>little more than 6 months!!  It&apos;s amazing the amount I have learned in<br/>that period of time... some of it TOTALLY transforming my music!  You<br/>will regret leaving!</p><p>And Paul Erlich wrote in TD 683:</p><p>&gt; Judith, I&apos;m glad you spoke up, I too am a musician and I believe<br/>&gt; music should be the true focus of this list, and have offered more<br/>&gt; than once to take the math-oriented discussions onto a separate list<br/>&gt; to avoid scaring away musicians who are less math oriented.</p><p>Oh... this is a terrible idea.  Just horrible.  Awful.  And did I<br/>mention that it really is a bad idea??</p><p>I would hate that.  Part of the &quot;fun&quot; is reading through articles I<br/>can&apos;t understand... NB ADAM BUSHELL... sometimes I FINALLY DO understand<br/>them!!  The stuff &quot;seeps in&quot; eventually... or some of it does.</p><p>If I understand everything on the list and know totally what&apos;s going<br/>on... what&apos;s the point in reading it??</p><p>I admit there should be a RANGE of articles... but I think many of us<br/>have been presenting those of late.</p><p>And if people think the HEXANYS are just arcane math, get ye to<br/>Anaphoria and waft the airwaves there!  These patterns are beautiful,<br/>visually and in sound.  There is nothing &quot;arcane&quot; about any of this from<br/>an artistic standpoint, and one doesn&apos;t have to understand all the<br/>arithmetic behind it in order to enjoy the beauties!</p><p>&gt; So even if the math-oriented material were on a separate list, we&apos;d<br/>&gt; probably come back to this list often to report our findings,</p><p>Did I ever say that this would be a terrible idea???</p><p>______________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
