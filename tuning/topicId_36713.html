Nobody expects much of a &quot;critical&quot; report from me, being a<br/>board member in, hopefully, good standing, but I do have a couple of<br/>observations.</p><p>1. Tristan Murail&apos;s _Winter Fragments_ was excellent, and I found<br/>Murail to be a very affable and interesting individual.  More on that<br/>piece follows.</p><p>2. Johnny&apos;s &quot;intoning&quot; of the Harry Partch _Seventeen Lyrics by Li Po_<br/>has, to my ear, taken a different twist from his earlier Partch<br/>presentations.  It seems he is emphasizing less the &quot;eccentric&quot;<br/>aspects of Partch and going right for the *musical* value which is<br/>considerable in these songs.  In fact, there were some purely musical<br/>moments that were truly transcendent.  I wish we could get a .mp3 of<br/>some of these sections up on the Web.  Johnny&apos;s always an excellent<br/>performer, and this, without a doubt is the best and most serious<br/>Partch presentation I have seen by him.  Not that one always has to<br/>be serious, but so many people associate Partch = kook, that it&apos;s<br/>refreshing to take a bit more &quot;musical&quot; view.</p><p>3. The Brandenburg #4 in Werckmeister III was SUPERB.  It was really<br/>well played by the ensemble.  This wonderful work belies all those<br/>doubters running around who say &quot;these modern music xenharmonicists<br/>just play *anything...*&quot; etc.  This was precision work with some of<br/>the best performers in the city, and it shows that these performers,<br/>although many of them specialize in contemporary music, have their<br/>traditional &quot;chops&quot; together as well.  Johnny should get a special<br/>commendation for the recorder part in the Brandenburg.  Very well<br/>done; a truly professional job!</p><p>Doubters:  beware of the AFMM!!!</p><p>4. Well, this was a point that came in a discussion with Tristan<br/>Murail after the performance.  It seems that he really uses only<br/>QUARTERTONES to emulate spectral work in his electronic part.<br/>Actually, I *had* heard that the so-called &quot;spectral&quot; composers did<br/>this, but I rather forgot about it.</p><p>It seems really not so *precise* to me.  I mentioned the Ezra Sims 72-<br/>tET system to Murail, and he had never heard of the notation.  Of<br/>course, he really isn&apos;t a native to this country, but I was a little<br/>surprised.</p><p>It seems quartertones are maybe a little &quot;gross&quot; (in every sense) for<br/>this kind of work, but Murail was saying that it was even difficult<br/>to get some of his players to do THAT MUCH.  This rather concurs with<br/>some of my *own* statements about performers, so I am happy to see my<br/>own estimations reinforced by others&apos; perceptions.</p><p>That&apos;s no reason to despair... just a realization that more work<br/>needs to be done in training performers.</p><p>Personally, though, I think the addition of the two additional<br/>microtones: the 12th of a whole tone and the 6th of a whole tone,<br/>would lend a *far* greater precision to these spectral efforts...<br/>without an *extreme* difficulty on the part of the performer.</p><p>Anyway, Murail was a pleasant person to converse with, and it was<br/>nice to know that he had a really great piece too, with some nice<br/>sounds that he had sampled and spectrally modified and integrated<br/>with &quot;tuning&quot; in the orchestra.</p><p>He pointed out to me, though, that &quot;tuning&quot; really isn&apos;t a correct<br/>term for &quot;spectral&quot; music.  Since there is really no *fixed* gamut,<br/>and things are changing all the time, according to Murail there<br/>really is no &quot;tuning...&quot;; it&apos;s strictly a *continuum...*</p><p>Maybe instead of the &quot;Tuning List&quot; we should call this the &quot;Frequency<br/>continuum&quot; list... :)  dunno.</p><p>Great concert, Johnny!  One of the best I have yet heard in the 21<br/>years of attending them!!!!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
