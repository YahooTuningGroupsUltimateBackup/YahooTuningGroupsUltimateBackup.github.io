So let me guess:</p><p>First part: Sensi[11]<br/>Second part: you used the MOS of the doubled generator - meaning the<br/>MOS generated by the (9/7)^2 &ap; 5/3 instead of 9/7<br/>Third part: 9-limit chords (but no comma pump?)</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>petrparizek2000 &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2012 1:42:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike,<br/>to make a long story short, if you take a 12-tone chain of semisixth generators and sort the pitches in monotonic order (despite the fact that it doesn&apos;t make a MOS), you can get the whole thing on a conventional 12-tone keyboard. :-D<br/>The first part is based on the wide minor seconds made by stacking 3 generators, three of which add up to a major third.<br/>The second part uses a mode whose steps alternate between +3 and -5 generators.<br/>And the third part is something like imitating BP except the fact that the 3/1s, rather than working as the period, span 7 generators here, which means that the 3:5:7:9 chord is now something like 0_2_6_7 in terms of generator numbers.<br/>---<br/>Okay, that&apos;s just about it.<br/>Petr<br/>PS: A huge 5-limit pun coming soon. :-D</p></div>
