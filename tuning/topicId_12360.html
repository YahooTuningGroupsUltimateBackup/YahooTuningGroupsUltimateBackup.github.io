I&apos;m a musician first, and all this math probably comes out<br/>&quot;tainted&quot; by a bias toward _my_ musical needs.</p><p>&gt;Bottom line: I don&apos;t believe the 39-point<br/>&gt;scale is any lower in harmonic entropy than the 40-point one, until we<br/>&gt;assume mutiple fundamentals, chord changes, yada.  I don&apos;t think the duet<br/>&gt;restriction will do it (cough).</p><p>Well, if you&apos;re strict about _not_ allowing &quot;reverb&quot;, the duet restriction<br/>does do it . . . unless we assume a common fundamental for all diads . . .</p><p>&gt;By &quot;your examples&quot;,<br/>&gt;I meant theory-ones about approximations and such -- one involving the<br/>&gt;8/5 comes to mind.</p><p>??</p></div>
