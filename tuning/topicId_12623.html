Pat Metheny has said<br/>that he&apos;d rather use it for solos instead of his Synclavier...Bill<br/>Frisell, Fripp, Adrian Belew, and Andy Summers were (are?) users of the<br/>GR 300 in the past. I think it&apos;s a landmark invention in the guitar<br/>arsenal...yes, it&apos;s somewhat limited, and I think of it as sort of a hot<br/>rod fuzztone, but it has many valuable uses, especially for &quot;outside&quot;<br/>types of music. I have used it extensively for 20 years, and actually<br/>have 2 of them. It can be used by any guitar, in any tuning...all you<br/>need is the pickup, which is easily available. It tracks almost<br/>perfectly, and when you learn how to use the various filters and octave<br/>settings, you can get some real interesting things happening. I am quite<br/>surprised that it didn&apos;t catch on more than it did...I used it on 2<br/>tunes on my &quot;Other Worlds&quot; CD, &quot;The Spider&quot; and &quot;Diggeridon&apos;t.&quot; I would<br/>like to have all of my guitars fixed with it...Hstick</p></div>
