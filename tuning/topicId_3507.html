James Murray Barbour himself<br/>&gt;suggested a Temperament by &quot;Regularly Varied Fifths&quot; which is similar in<br/>&gt;concept to Paul&apos;s save that Barbour used a linear increment and Paul a<br/>&gt;trigonometric formula. Barbour&apos;s tuning is given on pages 181-183 of<br/>&gt;&quot;Tuning and Temperament.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Barbour started with the fift D-A and added an increment to each fifth<br/>&gt;around the circle in both directions. The increments are 1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +<br/>&gt;6 + 5 +4 +3 +2 +1 = 36 parts (from 700 cents). D-A is 3 parts flatter<br/>&gt;than 700; B-F# and F-C will have 700 cents and Ab-Eb will be 3 parts<br/>&gt;sharper than equal. Barbour recommends the part be 1 cent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Barbour&apos;s tuning is tempered to a greater extent than Erlich&apos;s as [Barbour&apos;s]<br/>&gt;flattest fifth (D-A) has 697 cents and his sharpest, (Ab-Eb, has 703.<br/>&gt;The best thirds (C-E, G-B) have 392 cents and the worst ( Gb-Bb, Db-F)<br/>&gt;408. A part of 1.75 cents makes the best thirds just, but the worst<br/>&gt;about 414 cents.</p><p>For the clock-based temperaments I reported, I chose the amount of variation in<br/>fifth size that made the largest fifths Pythagorean in order to avoid &quot;harmonic<br/>waste&quot;. Since Barbour didn&apos;t avoid harmonic waste, I&apos;ll go ahead propose a variant<br/>that matches Barbour&apos;s worst and best major thirds:</p><p>FIFTHS</p><p>     Barbour Erlich<br/>f-c   700    700<br/>c-g   699    698.76<br/>g-d   698    697.86<br/>d-a   697    697.52<br/>a-e   698    697.86<br/>e-b   699    698.76<br/>b-f#  700    700<br/>f#-c# 701    701.24<br/>c#-g# 702    702.14<br/>g#-eb 703    702.48<br/>eb-bb 702    702.14<br/>bb-f  701    701.24</p><p>MAJOR THIRDS</p><p>     Barbour Erlich<br/>f-a   394    394.14<br/>c-e   392    392<br/>g-b   392    392<br/>d-f#  394    394.14<br/>a-c#  398    397.86<br/>e-g#  402    402.14<br/>b-eb  406    405.86<br/>f#-bb 408    408<br/>c#-f  408    408<br/>g#-c  406    405.86<br/>eb-g  402    402.14<br/>bb-f  398    397.86</p><p>I get essentially the same major thirds as Barbour but my fifths are &quot;rounder&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Barbour doesn&apos;t describe the fifths and thirds of his tuning in as much<br/>&gt;detail as Paul did (and I don&apos;t have time today to do so myself, alas),<br/>&gt;but the chromatic octave is 0 92 197 297 392 500 591 699 794 894 999<br/>&gt;1091 and 1200 cents.</p><p>Mine is 0 92 196.62 296.62 392 500 590.76 698.76 794.14 894.14 998.76 1090.76 1200.</p></div>
