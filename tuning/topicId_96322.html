If this still sounds like it refers to 1, then keep<br/>doubling the 6 down a few octaves until it doesn&apos;t. Now, if you take<br/>that 9:10:11:12 to be a tetrachord and just double it down so that<br/>another copy of it starts where the &quot;6&quot; is, you arrive at<br/>18:20:22:24:27:30:33:36, or in Scala format:</p><p>!<br/>Tetrachordal semitonal scale<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 10/9<br/> 11/9<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 5/3<br/> 11/6<br/> 2/1</p><p>So the first obvious thing to do is start tempering away. It seems<br/>pretty obvious to get rid of 121/120 and 81/80 here, and once you go<br/>that far, 176/175 is sure to follow.

There are no<br/>doubt a lot more beautiful scales like these that make sense when<br/>analyzed as near-MOS&apos;s of some temperament we know (Paul&apos;s<br/>pentachordal scales are among them). I also had like a 3-hour jam<br/>session on my 31-tet guitar today and realized that, while the Graham<br/>complexity of 11 in meantone is pretty high, this isn&apos;t as relevant if<br/>you just keep modulating between meantone near-MOS&apos;s that have 11/8 in<br/>them. AND, in fact, this is what we do in jazz all the time - switch<br/>between lydian dominant here, to the altered scale there, to ionian<br/>here, to lydian aug #2 there, etc. These are all modes of varioua<br/>meantone near-MOS&apos;s.</p><p>In fact, I use near-MOS&apos;s more than I use MOS&apos;s.

As for how they&apos;re related, mohajira and meantone<br/>are already related in that they both temper out 81/80, and mohajira<br/>is just one possible 11-limit extension of meantone. Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon<br/>scale system is related to this because it seems natural to eliminate<br/>81/80, and I&apos;m sure you can see why that is, and 243/242, which is the<br/>difference between two 11/9 neutral thirds and 3/2. This also means<br/>that 121/120 vanishes, since 243/242 / 81/80 = 121/120, which means<br/>that 11/10 and 12/11 are equated.</p><p>There are no doubt tons of other ways to temper this scale as well,<br/>but the &quot;overarching system&quot; that you describe is mohajira, which<br/>appears to be the structure that you&apos;ve conceptually latched onto,<br/>which is itself a part of the &quot;overarching system&quot; of meantone.</p><p>Read the xenharmonic wiki more :)</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;but looks more like a jigsaw puzzle piece than a parallelogram.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; Sound to me like you are optimizing away from a pure MOS in order to make certain dyads more accurate via irregular temperament drawing on a combination between Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales, Mohajira, and Meantone scales...IE the same thing I&apos;ve been working on for ages.</p><p>No, it has nothing to do with dyadic accuracy or irregular<br/>temperaments. &quot;Near-MOS&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s an MOS that&apos;s<br/>irregularly tempered, it means that it&apos;s a scale that is not an MOS.<br/>However, it&apos;s almost an MOS, and has some of the properties that MOS<br/>scales do, but specifically it doesn&apos;t have the one in which all of<br/>the interval classes work out to have two specific interval sizes.</p><p>An example of a near-MOS scale is the 12-tet ascending melodic minor<br/>scale. Some of the intervals here have two step sizes (like the<br/>seconds), but some have three (like the fifths). Take a look at it:<br/>- 81/80 still vanishes, since 9/8 and 10/9 are equated<br/>- 128/125 still vanishes, since the diminished fourth that now exists<br/>in this scale is the same as the major third, as popularly exploited<br/>on the 7th mode of this scale<br/>- 25/24 still serves as a chromatic vector</p><p>So far as the 5-limit is concerned, the only tuning that eliminates<br/>both 81/80 and 128/125 is 12-tet (if you do the tempering evenly). If<br/>you&apos;re going to make 25/24 the chromatic vector, then you will end up<br/>splitting the lattice into 7-note blocks. The thing about the melodic<br/>minor scale is that these blocks, while still remaining 7 notes long,<br/>will be uneven - they&apos;ll look more like a block with a chunk of the<br/>corner ripped off and pasted onto the other side, like a jigsaw puzzle<br/>piece or something.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp; On the bright side maybe (finally) I have someone somewhat on board with my ideas... :-D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can put this all into more convincing terms than I have.</p><p>Post your dimension scale up and we&apos;ll see how close to mohajira it<br/>is. But like I said, this doesn&apos;t really have anything to do with<br/>well-temperaments.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2011 4:46:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Tetrachordal Mohajira Near-MOS in 31-tet</p><p>This is listed here</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Strictly+proper+7-note+31edo+scales">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Strictly+proper+7-note+31edo+scales</a></p><p>as &quot;Sikah; Neutral Diatonic Hypolydian&quot; under &quot;Mohajira type&quot;.</p><p>&gt; There are more temperaments than I can keep track of these days, and I<br/>&gt; have so far not delved into their near-MOS&apos;s at all.

I think Carl has<br/>&gt; nominated other things as more important, so let&apos;s see if he<br/>&gt; chips in.</p><p>In the 5-10 note range, scale evenness is definitely audible.<br/>If it&apos;s audible it can be important.  Rothenberg propriety is<br/>one of many ways to measure it.  Whether it&apos;s really better<br/>than any other way is a question for experiment.  But it&apos;s at<br/>least plausible that it&apos;s among the better ways, and it&apos;s<br/>fairly admissive as these things go, so it&apos;s probably the best<br/>starting point.  Lumma impropriety is a related concept I&apos;ve<br/>been known to advance.</p><p>Mean variety is also going to be correlated to evenness, but<br/>I suspect it has some importance of its own, strictly from a<br/>melodic standpoint.  From a harmonic standpoint, we know scales<br/>with at most 2 kinds of generic interval contain tunings of<br/>rank 2 temperaments.</p><p>Scale size is important within the 5-10 note range, but maybe<br/>more important for scales that are pretty even.  That&apos;s an<br/>interesting prediction that can be tested: do melodies in 5-ET<br/>and 6-ET sound more different than in a pair of 5- and 6-tone<br/>improper scales?</p><p>Finally, there are octave equivalence and omnitetrachordality.<br/>I think they&apos;re audible melodically.  Harmonic subdivision may<br/>be too - we&apos;ve talked about that recently.</p><p>Harmonically, you get into things like, Is there a generic<br/>interval that maps to the same concordance in most modes?<br/>This makes it possible to quickly set up a fundamental in every<br/>mode, and quickly identify its corresponding generic interval<br/>(e.g. fifth).  Paul talks about this in his first paper I think.<br/>Omnitetrachordality will tend to give it to you.  So will MOS<br/>where the generator is a concordance.  A lot of these things<br/>overlap.</p><p>One thing I think is original to me - or at least I came up<br/>with it independently - is my &quot;diatonic property&quot;.  This is<br/>where a given generic interval is concordant in most modes,<br/>but via more than one concordance.

In fact, the whole concept of there being some<br/>kind of &quot;diatonic hearing&quot; I have always viewed as completely<br/>antithetical to the way that I perceive music, and I&apos;m always very<br/>vocal about that. This is because I&apos;m not used to centering music, or<br/>centering chord progressions, or centering melodies, around some kind<br/>of central diatonic scale to begin with. Often I&apos;ll jump from scale to<br/>scale throughout a piece of music, springboarding from one to the<br/>other as much as possible. Usually it&apos;s like, every chord will have<br/>its own scale, and often they&apos;ll be very different from one another. I<br/>guess you could say that there&apos;s some kind of separate &quot;diatonic<br/>hearing&quot; going on for every single chord, but the way that I&apos;ve heard<br/>the concept used just doesn&apos;t sync up for me.</p><p>But I just realized - I haven&apos;t defeated Rothenberg at all. I&apos;ve just<br/>moved the prediction away from &quot;diatonic&quot; hearing to &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>hearing. Every prediction I&apos;ve ever heard about &quot;diatonic&quot; hearing,<br/>which I&apos;ve always hated, actually sums me up pretty much in a nutshell<br/>if you just replace it with &quot;chromatic&quot; hearing. Once I realized this,<br/>the world cycled promptly through a series of colors and I heard a<br/>gong go off somewhere in the distance.</p><p>The concept of using the chromatic scale as a &quot;measuring stick,&quot; and<br/>the prediction that my categorical perception is almost completely<br/>defined by this, are all true. In fact, this concept almost completely<br/>dominates my entire perception of music. My AP is even somehow<br/>partially based off of this.</p><p>The reason is probably that I&apos;ve trained myself to internalize how all<br/>of these scales in 12-tet relate to one another, and how they relate<br/>to different transpositions of one another, and how they relate to the<br/>octatonic scale, and etc. Like I&apos;m aware of how to turn melodic minor,<br/>by a few alterations, into the octatonic scale, and then I&apos;m also<br/>aware of how those alterations fit into meantone harmony, so I can<br/>springboard off of the octatonic scale as though it were a dom7 chord<br/>with some extensions. I have a little whole cognitive world based<br/>around this concept, but the &quot;way&quot; I actually do this is by using<br/>12-tet as a measuring stick, just like Rothenberg predicts.</p><p>Maybe people who tend to play more common practice music think more<br/>often in terms of the diatonic scale and slight alterations to it, and<br/>I&apos;ve just lost the ability to hear things that way now. I definitely<br/>can&apos;t hear the pentatonic scale that way anymore.</p><p>So I think that propriety may actually be of paramount importance when<br/>setting up a &quot;base&quot; chromatic structure to perform mental<br/>manipulations on. I don&apos;t have much of a problem moving to the<br/>meantone[12] MOS, although it usually takes a second for me to map out<br/>where the diatonic vs chromatic half steps are. I might have a problem<br/>moving to a 12-note MOS if it&apos;s ridiculously improper, in terms of<br/>using this scale as a mental measuring stick. In fact, I think that<br/>even MOS matters here, because if I had four or five different<br/>&quot;fundamental&quot; interval sizes that I thought in instead of just one<br/>12-tet half step, or 2 meantone half steps - that would be complete<br/>insanity.</p><p>So maybe the way to go is to find proper &quot;chromatic&quot;-sized MOS&apos;s, and<br/>then look at &quot;diatonic&quot;-sized subsets of those scales. If one can<br/>learn to &quot;think&quot; in the proper chromatic structure, then I feel like<br/>you have a winner.</p><p>This is an experiment that I would like to see done, and seems very<br/>related to my fundamental perception of music, probably more so than<br/>HE or anything like that.

The scale he&apos;s<br/>playing completely changes like every 2 seconds on average.<br/>Furthermore a lot of the chords he&apos;s using take advantage of the<br/>128/125 unison vector - if you&apos;re playing the octatonic scale or the<br/>7th mode of melodic minor over a dom7 chord, we&apos;ve left the realm of<br/>just simply altering the diatonic scale fashion in such a way that you<br/>get a proper scale.</p><p>Or if you want to really get out there, then all of the stuff that<br/>Jaco does in his string arrangement of Herbie&apos;s &quot;Speak Like a Child&quot; -<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3dKJATAJmA&t=2m17s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3dKJATAJmA&t=2m17s</a>.

I am however, at all times using the 12-tet<br/>chromatic scale as the measuring stick, which is something I didn&apos;t<br/>realize before.

I don&apos;t get<br/>confused when I hear something like C Eb F F# G Bb C, because I always<br/>know that C-Eb is 3\12 and the F-G is 2\12, whether or not one of them<br/>is &quot;a second&quot; or &quot;a third&quot; in that scale. And I&apos;m also always aware<br/>that C-Eb is 6/5 and F-G is 9/8. That sort of thing. Point is, if I<br/>didn&apos;t have 12-tet as a reference, I might be up against some shaky<br/>waters there.

There is no impetus to<br/>invent a new system of notation for the octatonic scale, when that<br/>scale is generally being used most often over diminished and dominant<br/>7 chords. There may be mass confusion, however.</p><p>So to avoid mass confusion, the &quot;standard&quot; way to spell out extended<br/>harmonies in jazz is to refer to the b9, #9, #11, b7, and b13.<br/>Sometimes you&apos;ll see b5 and #5 too, in certain cases. But nobody will<br/>ever spell the major third in an altered chord out as a diminished<br/>fourth, ever. The altered scale consists of a root, a b9, a #9, a<br/>major third, a b5 or a #11 depending on which makes for an easier to<br/>read score in context, a b13, and a b7.

I think that the discordance of that structure is what<br/>leads to different modes, chord progressions, or countermelodies as in<br/>George&apos;s example sounding consonant or dissonant in different cases.</p><p>It&apos;s all very predictable: chord progressions from phrygian tend to sound<br/>darker than chord progressions from aeolian, which tend to sound darker than<br/>chord progressions from mixolydian. Chord progressions from mixolydian b6<br/>(Radiohead) tend to sound darker than chord progression from mixolydian.<br/>Critical band effects wouldn&apos;t matter here unless you&apos;re playing all of the<br/>notes at the same time.</p><p>To pick some nits, I think all of this is being performed on a virtual<br/>harmonic structure in which the volume of each note is a function of the<br/>last time you heard it. This assumes that HE can be extended in a<br/>well-behaved way to chords in which the volume of each note varies. I hope<br/>so, because if you&apos;re playing 20:24:25:30, and as you lower the volume of<br/>24, the discordance of this chord for all intents and purposes will start to<br/>approach that of 4:5:6.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Try this: hold a C down in the bass. Then, an octave up,<br/>&gt; &gt; arpeggiate a JI 8-&gt;9-&gt;10-&gt;9-&gt;8, so that the 8 is an octave<br/>&gt; &gt; above the C and the whole thing fleshes out an arpeggiated<br/>&gt; &gt; 4:8:9:10 chord. Then, to compare,<br/>&gt; &gt; try 16-&gt;17-&gt;19-&gt;20-&gt;19-&gt;17-&gt;16, so that what we were<br/>&gt; &gt; calling &quot;8&quot; before we now call 16, so that the whole thing<br/>&gt; &gt; fleshes out an arpeggiated 8:16:17:19:20 chord. Then, to<br/>&gt; &gt; compare with something more xenharmonic, try<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-&gt;13-&gt;14-&gt;15-&gt;14-&gt;13-&gt;12, so that the whole thing fleshes<br/>&gt; &gt; out an arpeggiated 6:12:13:14:15 chord. The latter two make<br/>&gt; &gt; the 5/4 sound more dissonant than the first one. Is this close<br/>&gt; &gt; to what you are talking about?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not at all. There&apos;s no particular scale referenced here.<br/>&gt; And I the 5:2 sounds the same to me in the first two<br/>&gt; examples. And it&apos;s a 5:3 in the last example, which yeah,<br/>&gt; is more discordant than 5:2.</p><p>In the last example, it&apos;s a 12:15 on top, which is a 5:4, and the outer dyad<br/>is 6:15, is a 5:2...</p><p>&gt; &gt; because the following chord progression:<br/>&gt; &gt; 10/4 ||: Cmaj Dbmaj7 Ebmaj6 (C Bb C C,) :||<br/>&gt; &gt; Contains mostly major chords, but the Dbmaj sounds much more<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant than the other major chords as well, again due to a<br/>&gt; &gt; mixture of harmonic entropy and priming.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see how either harmonic entropy or priming come<br/>&gt; into play. Nor do I hear the Dbmaj7 as more dissonant (only<br/>&gt; very slightly due to, I think, absolute pitch effects).</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by absolute pitch effects here. I hear the Dbmaj7<br/>as much darker than the other chords.</p><p>In general, I think you&apos;ll agree that that chord progression is darker than,<br/>say, ||: Cmaj | Fmaj | Gm | Fmaj :||, despite that the Gm is a minor chord.<br/>Compare &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; and &quot;Louie Louie&quot; - which one is<br/>darker?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2011 8:02:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think it&apos;s due to the fact that it reminds us that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; part of the dim7 in the scale - same as George&apos;s example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I agree, but that&apos;s what I meant by priming.

I&apos;ve heard &quot;priming&quot; used to describe that effect. So for<br/>this to happen, and assuming that we&apos;re still in agreement that all of<br/>this &quot;sadness&quot; stuff has something to do with chords being lower in<br/>tonalness, that means periodicity processing must even be active on<br/>&quot;memories&quot; of notes that aren&apos;t even being played right now.</p><p>So I think that this doesn&apos;t just apply to obvious cases like hitting<br/>an Eb and then a C-G later, but also more subtly to scales. If I play<br/>D minor, and then Cmaj7, the whole thing will imply a 7-note structure<br/>which has its own entropy and hence feeling. In this case it&apos;s the<br/>ionian mode. And as far as modal harmony is concerned, there is a<br/>reason that Phrygian sounds darker than Aeolian, and that&apos;s probably<br/>it.</p><p>So if, when you say that scalar intervals can &quot;remind&quot; you of things,<br/>you mean specifically that memories of scale-appropriate notes are<br/>pulled up from long-term memory due to a lifetime of conditioning, and<br/>those virtual notes are then processed with the VF mechanism due to<br/>some kind of abstract LTP/classical conditioning version of &quot;priming,&quot;<br/>then yes, I agree. Otherwise I&apos;m not sure I understand.</p><p>&gt; &gt; here&apos;s one more chord example which is related to that:<br/>&gt; &gt; ||: Cmaj | Gm | Cmaj | Dm :||<br/>&gt; &gt; vs<br/>&gt; &gt; ||: Cmaj | Gm | Cmaj | Fm :||<br/>&gt; &gt; vs<br/>&gt; &gt; ||: Cmaj | Gm | Cmaj | Abm :||<br/>&gt; &gt; I think the Fm is more dissonant than the Dm.

It&apos;s a constructive proof that scalar intervals are important.</p><p>You posted an example in which a ~5/4 sounds consonant in one context<br/>and dissonant in another. You postulated that the dissonance in the<br/>second context stems from it being a diminished fourth, whereas in the<br/>first it&apos;s a major third. I came up with a counterexample in which a<br/>diminished fourth sounds consonant, which to me proves that all of<br/>this has nothing at all to do whether the ~5/4 subtends three vs four<br/>scale steps. I also posted the 4:8:9:10 vs 8:16:17:19:20 vs<br/>6:12:13:14:15 example, which is what I think that it does have to do<br/>with. Now you say that none of that matters because in one example, a<br/>major third sounded consonant and a diminished fourth sounded<br/>dissonant, therefore correlation equals causation. Now I feel like I&apos;m<br/>the one taking crazy pills.</p><p>And I still don&apos;t understand why exactly a diminished fourth is<br/>supposed to be dissonant, or how dissonance could possibly emerge from<br/>anything except for periodicity processing.

If you play C-G and you<br/>imagine an Eb, it sounds less tonal than if you imagine an E. You<br/>don&apos;t need priming to trigger the effect. We spoke about this offlist<br/>and you said you had no problem believing any of this because memories<br/>can weakly reactivate relevant neural pathways or something like that.<br/>Likewise, I believe that remembering, or even just imagining these<br/>notes can influence the way that periodicity processing works. Play a<br/>bare E-Bb dyad, and then imagine that as part of different chords, and<br/>the tonalness of the E-Bb will subtly change.</p><p>In fact, let&apos;s get even simpler with it: a long time, when we were<br/>talking about periodicity buzz, you posted an example where 1/1 was in<br/>the left ear and 7/4 was in the right ear, and showed us that although<br/>this gets rid of buzz, the general &quot;quality&quot; of the interval is the<br/>same as ever. You used this to &quot;prove&quot; that the periodicity mechanism<br/>was still at work. I&apos;m now doing the same thing with priming, but if<br/>you think that perceptually just checking the quality of the sounds<br/>you hear is a bad way to test these things, then it also invalidates<br/>examples like the one you posted.</p><p>&gt; &gt; is coming from you simply imagining that chord,<br/>&gt; &gt; how it fits into the current notes that are being played,<br/>&gt; &gt; coming to an awareness of the entire harmonic structure as some<br/>&gt; &gt; kind of &quot;virtual chord&quot; that you&apos;re just imagining, and then<br/>&gt; &gt; assessing how discordant it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. I said it possibly comes from remembering music previously<br/>&gt; heard.</p><p>What does remembering music previously heard mean if not remembering<br/>individual chords and such?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is this what you&apos;re saying?
