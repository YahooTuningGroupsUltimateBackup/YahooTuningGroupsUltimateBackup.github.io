I am<br/>trying to design a harmonium keyboard, primarily for the 22-shruti<br/>Indian scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p><p>Hello, Haresh.</p><p>Please refer to the (zipped) file which I have put here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KbScal5c.zip</p><p>This contains a diagram of the generalized keyboard that was used on<br/>two Scalatrons that were built in the 1970s, with 31 separate tones<br/>per octave and 5 key colors.  (A third instrument was given a<br/>keyboard with 9 colors and 55 or 56 tones per octave -- I don&apos;t know<br/>which.)  This adaptation of the Bosanquet generalized keyboard was a<br/>collaboration between Richard Harasek (of Motorola), Erv Wilson, and<br/>myself.  The elliptical keys were made of molded plastic, but for a<br/>harmonium you would probably find it easier to use elongated<br/>hexagons, which is Erv Wilson&apos;s preference (see the links I have<br/>given below).</p><p>The keyboard geometry is such that any tonal system consisting of a<br/>single series or circle of fifths can be mapped so that any interval,<br/>scale, or chord may be easily transposed by starting at a different<br/>position and using exactly the same fingering pattern.  You will find<br/>C as the white key farthest to the left, and the C major scale is<br/>played on the white keys.  Five sharp keys (in each octave) are in<br/>black, and five flat keys are in red.  Immediately beyond the black<br/>keys are blue keys, and in front of the red keys are green keys;<br/>these are mostly double sharps and double flats, but they can also<br/>function in other roles, depending on the tuning.  (The remaining<br/>near blue and far green and red keys were hard-wired duplicates that<br/>were used specifically for the 31-division of the octave; in most<br/>instances these are not used for tunings having fewer tones.  It<br/>would be best for you to ignore these.)</p><p>There are two important things to observe:</p><p>1) The key colors occur as alternating sets of 7 light-colored and 5<br/>dark-colored keys.  You do not have to use the colors that we used<br/>for the Scalatron, but I would strongly advise you to retain the<br/>alternating 7-light 5-dark pattern.</p><p>2) There is a vertical scale at the left side (with numbered G&apos;s,<br/>multiples of the generating interval of a fifth) that enables you to<br/>determine how many fifths in the series each key is located with<br/>respect to C.</p><p>Now to address your question more specifically, I will assume that<br/>the 22 shrutis can be assigned the following ratios (and would 1/1 be<br/>Sa?):</p><p> 0  1/1<br/> 1  256/243<br/> 2  16/15<br/> 3  10/9<br/> 4  9/8<br/> 5  32/27<br/> 6  6/5<br/> 7  5/4<br/> 8  81/64<br/> 9  4/3<br/>10  27/20<br/>11  45/32<br/>12  729/256<br/>13  3/2<br/>14  128/81<br/>15  8/5<br/>16  5/3<br/>17  27/16<br/>18  16/9<br/>19  9/5<br/>20  15/8<br/>21  243/128<br/>22  2/1</p><p>There are two possible ways to map these onto the Bosanquet<br/>keyboard.  If the srutis are treated as a 22-division of the octave,<br/>then they could be mapped the same way as 22-ET, in which the fifth<br/>is 13 degrees.  An octave of keys would then consist of the following<br/>degrees:</p><p>blue keys:   2, 6, 10, 11, 15, 19, 1<br/>black keys:  3, 7, 12, 16, 20<br/>white keys:  0, 4,  8,  9, 13, 17, 21, 22<br/>red keys:  1, 5, 10, 14, 18<br/>green keys:  20, 2, 6, 7, 11, 15, 19</p><p>This is also the 22-ET mapping by Erv Wilson to which Kraig Grady<br/>referred you here on page 13:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3a.PDF</a></p><p>Notice that some of the blue and black keys are duplicate pitches of<br/>the green and red ones.  Also, any two adjacent keys along any row or<br/>column in any direction will be separated by the same number of<br/>degrees.  Thus, like intervals in the system of shrutis will be<br/>played with like patterns.  However, like patterns will not always<br/>give you like intervals, since shrutis of the same number of degrees<br/>vary considerably in size.</p><p>For this reason I would recommend mapping these onto the keyboard in<br/>a different way:</p><p>blue keys:  -, -, -, 10, -, -, -<br/>black keys:  2, 6, 12, 15, 19<br/>white keys:  0, 4, 8, 9, 13, 17, 21, 22<br/>red keys:  1, 5, 11, 14, 18<br/>green keys:  -, 3, 7, -, -, 16, 20</p><p>This is also the way Erv Wilson mapped it.  If you go here, you will<br/>see how he employed the hexagonal key shape (page 5):</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen2.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen2.PDF</a></p><p>Here the shrutis are treated as a series of fifths (rather than a<br/>circle), so that there are no duplicate keys.  As before, like<br/>intervals will be played with like patterns, but like patterns will<br/>also give you like intervals (or very nearly so, since two of the<br/>fifths in the series are false by a schisma).</p><p>Since this is the same pattern in which 41-ET and 53-ET would be<br/>mapped, any two keys with the same lateral placement will differ in<br/>pitch by a comma (80:81), with the key farther from the player having<br/>the higher pitch.</p><p>All of this has assumed that C would be 1/1, but you could just as<br/>easily choose another key, as long as you moved everything else so<br/>that the relative positions were maintained.  Or you could tune the<br/>shrutis as a schismic temperament, which would give you the option of<br/>adding as many more tones to the series as you wish.  This would<br/>allow you to have a &quot;movable&quot; 1/1 (or movable Sa) so that the<br/>instrument could accompany singers with different vocal ranges (or is<br/>there now a pitch standard of some sort?).  (Or would this be of any<br/>use?)</p><p>I hope that this information will be helpful to you.  Also, please<br/>look for a response that I will be making to Carl Lumma to learn more<br/>about how this keyboard was used on the Scalatron.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39407 href="#39407">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2002 10:41:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Any retrospective comments on the Generalized-keyboard Scalatron?<br/>&gt; Still playing her?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Yes, but time has taken its toll.  The instrument is now 27 years old<br/>and there are a few things here and there that don&apos;t work anymore --<br/>probably due to solder joints that have crystallized.  One of these<br/>days I&apos;m going to have to open the thing up and remelt some of them.</p><p>As for retrospective comments, I have quite a few.</p><p>I am often given most of the credit for the application of the<br/>generalized keyboard to the Scalatron, but the truth is that Erv<br/>Wilson and Dick Harasek (president of Motorola Scalatron) had as much<br/>to do with it as I did (not to mention our dependence on the prior<br/>work of Bosanquet and Fokker).  In collaboration, we carefully<br/>considered all of the details and got everything right: the size and<br/>shape of the keys, the use of slightly convex key surfaces and<br/>placement of all the keys in a single plane (which together make it<br/>very easy to play a glissando anywhere in any direction), the proper<br/>front-to-back slant (17 degrees) of the keyboard (to minimize arm<br/>fatigue), employment of touch coding on the sharp and flat keys, and<br/>effective use of color (on which I received quite a bit of positive<br/>feedback).  To this day, I can&apos;t think of a single thing that we<br/>should have done differently.</p><p>I found that anyone sufficiently familiar with the conventional<br/>keyboard could perceive diatonic patterns on the new keyboard within<br/>a matter of seconds, so that it was possible to play simple<br/>conventional pieces with the tuning in either 12, 19, or 31-ET in<br/>almost no time at all.  And having the same fingering patterns in<br/>every key made learning the new microtonal intervals simple and<br/>straightforward.</p><p>Here&apos;s an interesting anecdote.  I have always kept the instrument<br/>covered with a bedsheet when it&apos;s not being used.  After I had it for<br/>several months, I thought it would be fun trying to play it with the<br/>sheet on it.  To my surprise (and great delight), it was almost as<br/>easy as playing it without the sheet.  Sometimes when I had a guest<br/>at the house who had not seen the instrument before, I would first<br/>play it with the sheet on it without revealing what was underneath,<br/>which made for a rather surrealistic experience to say the least.</p><p>I would also like to make a few comments about the keyboard layout<br/>and dimensions, for which you should also refer to this (zipped) file:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KbScal5c.zip</p><p>The lateral keys are spaced 7/8 inch (center to center) as on the<br/>piano keyboard, but since there are only 6 lateral keys to an octave,<br/>the octave distance is one key closer (good news for all you Scriabin<br/>fans).  After using it for a short time I realized that the keys<br/>would not even have to be that large.  On the piano keyboard one must<br/>be able to fit a finger between two black keys to depress the narrow<br/>part of a white key, but on the generalized Scalatron keyboard that<br/>problem does not occur.</p><p>The duplicate keys are important, not only to permit uniform<br/>fingering patterns in all keys, but to provide an option so that the<br/>thumb does not have to reach for the more distant keys, which would<br/>produce a strain on the hand (which is the reason why piano keys are<br/>so long).  As the number of tones in the octave is increased, the<br/>duplicate keys get farther apart and become less useful.  In my<br/>judgment, anything above 31 tones/octave is too far to reach (both<br/>for duplicate keys and for harmonically extended chords) with keys of<br/>this size, so unless the keys were made smaller, I would not<br/>recommend this keyboard for larger divisions of the octave.

That C triad<br/>using the F-flat key would now be a major triad, the green keys being<br/>a comma lower than the white keys (so that this is now E\).  The<br/>major triad is not too difficult to play in its inversions, but in<br/>root position bending the middle finger downward is not the best way<br/>to do it.  Instead, play the C with your index finger (observing that<br/>C and G aren&apos;t as far apart as they are on the Halberstadt) and cross<br/>your thumb under to get the E\.</p><p>This is the exact same technique that I would use on my decimal<br/>keyboard layout for both the major and subminor triads:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.zip">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.zip</a></p><p>Notice that my decimal keyboard design is right-rising.  This puts<br/>both the major and subminor thirds, 5/4 and 7/6, (vertically) below<br/>the root and fifth, 1/1 and 3/2, of their triads.  If the keyboard<br/>were left-rising, they would be (vertically) above the root and<br/>fifth, so that this technique could not be employed.  One unintuitive<br/>consequence of this is that the tones in vertical columns *drop* in<br/>pitch as you go *up* the column, but on the other hand, the generator<br/>scale at the left (the generating interval being a ^secor^) *does* go<br/>up the way you would expect, and the 3/2 is in the *positive*<br/>direction, so it^s not completely unintuitive to do it this way.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The duplicate keys are important, not only to permit uniform<br/>&gt; &gt;fingering patterns in all keys, but to provide an option so that<br/>&gt; &gt;the thumb does not have to reach for the more distant keys, which<br/>&gt; &gt;would produce a strain on the hand (which is the reason why piano<br/>&gt; &gt;keys are so long).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah.  The keys aren&apos;t marked on KbScal5C.bmp, so I can&apos;t see the<br/>&gt; dupes.</p><p>The extreme top and bottom red, green, and blue keys are the hard-<br/>wired duplicates for 31-ET, so you can easily match these with their<br/>duplicates, because they have the same colors.</p><p>For most divisions less then 31 (one exception is 29, and another is<br/>my 19+3 temperament described in message #38287), I stay within the<br/>green-blue color boundaries, so that only 31 keys per octave are<br/>used.  For 19 tones there are thus 12 duplicates, for 17 there are 14<br/>duplicates, and for 22 there are 9 duplicates.  Of course, the more<br/>duplicates the better (up to a point), but this amount of duplication<br/>works reasonably well, even for 22.</p><p>Like the Microzone keyboard, the colored key tops of the generalized<br/>Scalatron keyboard can be easily switched around to form different<br/>patterns, but I&apos;ve never found it necessary to do that, because all<br/>of the intervals, scales, and chords are played according to fixed<br/>patterns, including the keyboard vector for a (unison) duplicate<br/>key.  Once the patterns are learned, you do quite a lot by touch, so<br/>you don&apos;t have to look at the keyboard that often, which doesn&apos;t make<br/>it all that necessary to have something like lights in the keys that<br/>would change color with the tuning (as Mats suggested; by the way<br/>Mats, the key switches that were used for the Scalatron actually did<br/>have a provision for lighted keys, and we did briefly discuss the<br/>possibility of doing something like this with an on/off lighted<br/>pattern that would change with the tuning).  Of course, in a single-<br/>tuning acoustic instrument (such as the 19+3 accordion that I<br/>proposed in the message referenced above), it would make sense to<br/>have all duplicate pairs of keys the same color.</p><p>Getting back to your question about seeing the duplicates, if you<br/>again look at the diagram in the (zipped) file:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KbScal5c.zip</p><p>Go to the leftmost white key, which is C, and observe that the small<br/>cross in its center is in vertical alignment with the zero G mark in<br/>the scale just to the left.  If you want to find its duplicate in 19-<br/>ET, just go up to the +19 marker in that scale and find the key<br/>center that is at the same height.  In this case it&apos;s a green key<br/>that&apos;s beyond the blue-green color boundary, so it&apos;s not valid on<br/>this 31-tone hard-wired keyboard.  But at least you&apos;ve found the<br/>keyboard vector for duplicates in 19, so if you start at the red D-<br/>flat adjacent to C (at -5G) and go up 19 marks, you&apos;ll come to its<br/>duplicate at +14G, the blue key vertically aligned with D.  In<br/>essence, what we&apos;re doing is going through a series of fifths 19<br/>places, which brings us around a circle of 19 back to our starting<br/>tone.</p><p>You can do the same thing with any other division of the octave that<br/>will map onto this keyboard.  The point here is that, the larger the<br/>division, the farther apart (vertically) will be the duplicates.</p><p>&gt; &gt;In my judgment, anything above 31 tones/octave is too far to<br/>&gt; &gt;reach (both for duplicate keys and for harmonically extended<br/>&gt; &gt;chords) with keys of this size, so unless the keys were made<br/>&gt; &gt;smaller, I would not recommend this keyboard for larger divisions<br/>&gt; &gt;of the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s ok, up to 31 tones should keep us busy for quite a while!</p><p>If you want JI that includes pairs of tones separated by a comma, I<br/>find that a 29-tone mapping is particularly useful.

My vote for putting a gif version on the main<br/>&gt; page.  :)</p><p>Thank you for your kind words of appreciation (and you too, Joseph).<br/>This is a diagram that I did last year for my book-in-progress, and I<br/>tried to give the keys a 3-D appearance with subtle changes in color<br/>to illustrate the slightly convex key surfaces.  When I tried saving<br/>this as a gif file, not only did the subtleties disappear, but the<br/>blue and green keys came out looking very different (too garish), and<br/>I wasn&apos;t able to fix them to my satisfaction, hence the zipped file.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;Couldn&apos;t the ovals be straight, long axis perpendicular to the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;player?  Not sure how that would waste space or threaten vert.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;alignment...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There&apos;s no way to do it without making the keys much smaller and<br/>&gt; &gt;wasting a lot of space between them.  Just try mentally rotating<br/>&gt; &gt;the D and E-flat keys counter-clockwise slightly, and you&apos;ll see<br/>&gt; &gt;that the bottom of one will bump into the top of the other.  You&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt;have to make all of the keys shorter, which would leave a lot of<br/>&gt; &gt;space between D and D-flat, E and E-flat, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you turn your head you&apos;ll see that it&apos;s possible.  The octaves<br/>&gt; will no longer be equidistant from the player, which must be what<br/>&gt; you meant by vert. alignment...</p><p>No, that&apos;s horizontal (or lateral) alignment.  By vertical alignment<br/>I mean that lines connecting the centers of corresponding black and<br/>red keys (sharps and flats) are exactly vertical.  So we&apos;re keeping<br/>keys aligned in both directions.  This was Erv Wilson&apos;s idea, and I<br/>am in complete agreement.</p><p>In my right-hand accordion keyboard diagram (with circular buttons) I<br/>eliminated the vertical alignment, which shifted the sharps leftward,<br/>relative to the flats.  For the tuning used in this particular<br/>instance (19-tone well temperament) the sharps are lower in pitch<br/>than the flats, so it&apos;s not inappropriate to do this.  On the<br/>Scalatron they could be either lower or higher (depending on the<br/>tuning), so it is best to have the vertical alignment.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m guessing this can be solved<br/>&gt; in the mapping, but I&apos;ll spare you the claim until I can<br/>&gt; demonstrate it.</p><p>Now that I think about it, Erv Wilson also dispensed with the<br/>vertical alignment in his 19-tone clavichord design (beginning on<br/>page 6):</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen456.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen456.PDF</a></p><p>There he retained his elongated hexagons but gave them a vertical<br/>axis.  As I recall he was rather delighted at how well the Bosanquet<br/>geometry worked for a 19-tone octave.</p><p>&gt; I guess my question is, isn&apos;t the space wasted<br/>&gt; somewhat anyway, since unless one turns the hand his fingers do<br/>&gt; not move along the long axis of the keys?</p><p>You can depress a key near either end of its surface (handy if you<br/>have to stretch) without turning the hand, so I wouldn&apos;t consider it<br/>wasted space.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39640 href="#39640">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2002 10:06:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Thank you for your kind words of appreciation (and you too,<br/>&gt;Joseph).

Yes, you could spend a lot of time tweaking the palette of the .gif and then optimizing, but anything that you want to appear photo-realistic and have subtleties (especially for those convex/cave surfaces) really cries out for a much larger palette.
