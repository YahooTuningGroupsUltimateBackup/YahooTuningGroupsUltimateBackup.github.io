Edit the New name field to give the name you want to show for<br/>the test.</p><p>Now a new button will appear in the config window called &quot;Randomise for<br/>quiz&quot;</p><p>Click this and it will play one of the arpeggio intervals at random,<br/>and it plays it transposed to any of the scale degrees, so if you<br/>have chosen 72-tet as the scale, will transpose by any of the 72-tet<br/>scale degrees.</p><p>Idea is you then look away from the screen and listen and say which<br/>one you think it is.</p><p>Look back, after it has been played, and you will see a yes / no /<br/>cancel message.</p><p>Click Yes to hear next chord, No to play the same one again, and Cancel<br/>to end the test.</p><p>That should suffice I imagine. If it proves useful, could add<br/>a special window with boxes and check boxes to customise it - it is just<br/>something I added for fun pretty much, so very basic at present.<br/>You are the first to ask for this specifically.</p><p>Works for any scale / arpeggio. I have just described the test with two<br/>arpeggios, but you can show any number of arpeggio windows, and it will choose<br/>one of them at random each time.</p><p>Help for the Arp / Scale playback config window explains more (click on<br/>the blue &quot;?&quot; icon in top right corner). The drop lists can<br/>be used to choose method to play arpeggio - as chord, broken chord,<br/>sequence. Also figuration for the sequence option. Again, help goes<br/>into more detail.</p><p>However, I imagine a proper ear training program might do it somewhat<br/>differently? This is just presenting the intervals with no context.<br/>Perhaps recoginising chord progressions is more appropriate?</p><p>Something on chord progressions could be added a fair bit later<br/>when I add a chords section of some type to FTS.</p><p>One shouldn&apos;t be disappointed if one finds the test harder than<br/>one expects, as it can be harder to hear intervals when out<br/>of any musical context, depending on how one hears music.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/28/2001 7:03:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23911">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/23911</a></p><p>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FTS already has this.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks so much, Robert, for this post on ear training with the<br/>Fractal Tune Smithy.
