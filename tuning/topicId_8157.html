I was wondering if I could enroll as a student using microtonal<br/>resources.   He declined, since his training is entirely 12 TET, however he<br/>provided the following response.  I would be interested in your reactions<br/>and comments.  Are we/you collectors of meaningless treasures?</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>SEJIS Gainesville FL</p><p>&gt; I am interested in your question, because I am curious about your<br/>intention.<br/>&gt; I wonder sometimes if the modern sensibility is a little too devoted to<br/>the<br/>&gt; surface in art. It is not that I would want to disparage the surface. The<br/>&gt; greatest accomplishment of the 20th-century in music may prove in a larger<br/>&gt; perspective to be precisely its exploration of new kinds of musical<br/>surface.<br/>&gt; Beginning with Debussy, but also Strauss and Schoenberg, the orchestra and<br/>&gt; the instruments in general became very malleable for the creation of<br/>&gt; previously unimagined worlds of sound. Electronic music has furthered this<br/>&gt; development admirably. However, our experience of this may be too much the<br/>&gt; result of, or at least conditioned by, the crisis of meaning or value or<br/>&gt; significance to which we are subject in our time. When art ceases to be<br/>&gt; ABOUT something, the art-lover becomes a kind of collector of little<br/>&gt; meaningless treasures. I call this &quot;preciosity,&quot; as a description of the<br/>&gt; precious as an obsession.
