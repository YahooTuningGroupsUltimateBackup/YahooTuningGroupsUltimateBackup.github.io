I<br/>&gt;think D.C.Carr&apos;s description is actually closer to Schenker&apos;s in that<br/>&gt;for Schenker, much harmony is simply a way of structuralizing and<br/>&gt;embellishing what is ultimately scalar melodic motion, in conjuction<br/>&gt;with elaborations of I-V-I bass movements .</p><p> Yes, but a melodic descent of 3-2-1 or 5-4-3-2-1,  is an elaboration of<br/> 3-1 or 5-3-1. . . ie the triad.  I.e. a harmonic entity, elaborated by<br/> arpeggiation + passing tones.  As is a I-V-I bass line.  Thus in the<br/> farthest background is an harmonic entity.   Well, I don&apos;t<br/> know if Schenker himself went that far in reduction,  but Salzer&apos;s<br/> &quot;Structural Hearing&quot;, if I remember correctly, does go that far.<br/> Anyway, I know that book annoys diehard Schenkerites, etc. etc., but<br/> I was just trying to say that from a certain point of view, one<br/> can see line as ultimately deriving from harmonic concepts.</p><p>  Also, that when composing, and learning to compose, a &quot;good tune&quot;, I<br/> think one *has to* keep harmonic concepts of some sort in mind.</p><p> ***From:  Christopher Bailey******************<br/> <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a><br/> **********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=18630 href="#18630">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
