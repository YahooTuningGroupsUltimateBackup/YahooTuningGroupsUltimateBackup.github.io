I found that article at The Atlantic Monthly online<br/>archive. And yeah I agree that he&apos;s definitely got a gift for offering<br/>(often very insightful) commentary on these subjects in a way that is<br/>also engaging and kind of, oh, I don&apos;t know... chatty I guess. Here&apos;s<br/>another example:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/95sep/boulez.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/95sep/boulez.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I guess the point was whether anybody in the 21st century could<br/>really make that kind of statement and be taken seriously as an<br/>&quot;evaluator&quot; of Ives.</p><p>We might just have to agree to disagree here, because I have no<br/>problem whatsoever -- none -- imagining William Austin&apos;s &quot;without the<br/>prose, unfortunately, much of the music fails to make any clear<br/>effect...&quot; falling out of the mouth of someone who knows (or is<br/>supposed to know, etc., whatever) what they&apos;re talking about tomorrow.</p><p>&gt; To me, anyway, it seems Ives insurance &quot;stock&quot; has gone way up...</p><p>I agree. And I guess that can only be a good thing... but I also have<br/>a nagging feeling that when Schiff says, &quot;Ives has been used to<br/>authenticate everything from cowboy tunes to conceptualism,&quot; he&apos;s also<br/>offering a glimpse into why this is... in other words, are a lot more<br/>composers and critics (etc.) more willing to line up behind some<br/>permutation of the Ives complex -- or quoting Schiff again, &quot;a<br/>bottomless grab bag of contradictory achievements and promises&quot; --<br/>than they are behind his actual music? Perhaps these really are just<br/>one in the same? Who really seems like an extension of Ives, where<br/>both the actual sound or shape of his music and some particular<br/>visionary idea (or peculiarity) got a fair shake... Brant comes to<br/>mind... ?</p><p>Dan</p></div>
