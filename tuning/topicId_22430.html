From that point, the notation<br/>&gt; &gt; is based on the melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; consistency (or linear series) of the tuning as opposed to the<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic, not that this necessarily<br/>&gt; &gt; an opposition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think they are.  What do you intend by drawing the distinction?</p><p>The distinction is nothing more than approach to notation. One can base it on harmonic relations<br/>over melodic or visa versa. Both have there advantages. You are correct to imply that the<br/>bosanquet keyboard will steer one toward a good balance between the two.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Bosanquet layout ensures the two are not in opposition.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The further advantage of his notation is that the logic<br/>&gt; &gt; holds true from tuning to<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning and is consistent with a Bosanquet keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it&apos;s consistent with a Bosanquet keyboard, it&apos;s designed for a<br/>&gt; Bosanquet keyboard.  It certainly is not consistent from tuning to tuning.<br/>&gt;  In positive notation, a 4:5:6 triad is C E- G.  In negative notation it&apos;s<br/>&gt; C E G.  That&apos;s an inconsistency and it&apos;s a problem.</p><p>They also differ in terms of melodic/linear sequence so they should not be called the same thing.<br/>Your point is taken and this shows the advantage of a harmonically based notation, 5/4 will always<br/>be notated the same.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean the only construction.  You said before:  &quot;One of the<br/>&gt; things that really got Erv excited about Hanson&apos; s keyboard is that it<br/>&gt; handles 72 where as the Bosanquet does not.&quot;</p><p>Yes i was not clear here. There is the difference between the keyboard logic design and<br/>physicality of the keyboard. If one has a Bosanquet Keyboard you can put Hansons logic on it</p><p>&gt; So Bosanquet can&apos;t handle 72.  Whereas a keyboard constructed around a<br/>&gt; 10+1 &quot;Miracle&quot; scale could, along with 31 and 41.  Why does that not offer<br/>&gt; any promise for moving forward?</p><p>where is this keyboard and can&apos;t this scale be mapped to one of Hanson&apos;s already. Is it not a<br/>generalized?</p><p>&gt; If you haven&apos;t been following the Miracle discussion, I urge you to look<br/>&gt; back though it.  If there&apos;s something you don&apos;t understand, please ask.</p><p>I have no problem following the idea of a 7/72 generator. I have a 72 tone set of tubes tuned to a<br/>Just 72 that contains the Hebdomekontany. With 22 tone you can have an eikosany too. In fact the<br/>22 i have is found within this 72. It has 30 hexanies and 30 tetrads</p><p>&gt; &gt; Also a a learning tool it far surpasses in<br/>&gt; &gt; simplicity the use of<br/>&gt; &gt; matrixes to see the unison vectors in any tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I assume that&apos;s a swipe at me, as I&apos;m the one who uses matrixes.</p><p>not you personally at all. I hadn&apos;t followed who used them or didn&apos;t. I just find it hard to see<br/>what the scale is without having to map it all out.</p><p>&gt; So how<br/>&gt; does this negative notation help me to see the unison vector (4 -1)h?</p><p>who uses this notation?. If i look at the keyboard I can see that so many 3/2 will coincide with a<br/>5/4 keyboard rank. Etc. with the other intervals</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look, mathematicians tend to fall into one of two groups.  Those who think<br/>&gt; in terms of pictures, and those who think in numbers or symbols.  Erv<br/>&gt; looks like he&apos;s in the former group, and so are you.  I&apos;m in the latter.<br/>&gt; That doesn&apos;t stop me drawing diagrams, or Erv using numbers.  We can have<br/>&gt; a discussion without either of us having to be wrong.</p><p>Perhaps I assume that pictorial is better or more universal. It seems that with a picture it is<br/>easier to decipher. Matrixes require a certain background in math that not all have. I am glad<br/>they work for you . Maybe you look at them and the whole lattice pops out for you. For me and i<br/>imagine others this is not the case and one has to spend quite a time just mapping them out on<br/>paper.

Is it not a<br/>&gt; generalized?</p><p>No, it isn&apos;t generalized enough.  A simple keyboard for Miracle would<br/>look something like this:</p><p>                                        0^<br/>0^  1^  2^  3^  4^  5^  6^  7^  8^  9^  0<br/>0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0v<br/>0v  1v  2v  3v  4v  5v  6v  7v  8v  9v  0w<br/>0w</p><p>with the harmonic template</p><p>            5                   7<br/>1                       3<br/>        9           11</p><p>To fit that to a hexagonal keyboard, you need a run of 10 notes all<br/>going in one direction for an octave.  With a<br/>U648&lt;<a href="http://catalog.com/starrlab/keyboards.html">http://catalog.com/starrlab/keyboards.html</a>&gt;<br/>, this means you can get about two and a half octaves going diagonally<br/>across the keyboard.  So it can be done, but it&apos;s a real waste of<br/>resources.  I can get the same range with my X5D and a sustain pad.</p><p>You can also fit the scale to Modulus 31 or Modulus 41 or Hanson, but<br/>it&apos;ll look different each time.  So it isn&apos;t generalized.</p><p>There&apos;s a deeper problem with Wilson/Bosanquet in that it&apos;s based<br/>around hexagons.  When you have neutral thirds or two chains of<br/>generators, a square array becomes more convenient.  I&apos;ve thought<br/>about this before, even mentioned it in a letter to Erv, and<br/>considered it an unfortunate limitation to the Bosanquet concept.<br/>Until the Erlich-Keenan temperament came along, I didn&apos;t have a<br/>solution that covered both standard and neutral thirds.  I still don&apos;t<br/>have it all worked out, that&apos;s why I&apos;d prefer you to help us on this<br/>instead of questioning why we&apos;re doing it.  Of course no physical<br/>keyboard exists specifically for the Erlich-Keenan temperament.  Even<br/>the theory didn&apos;t exist a fortnight ago.</p><p>The best existing keyboard looks like the Z-board<br/>&lt;<a href="http://catalog.com/starrlab/keyboards2.html">http://catalog.com/starrlab/keyboards2.html</a>&gt;.  They way it&apos;s shaped<br/>it&apos;d be better to follow the lattice than the layout I gave above, but<br/>either would work better than on a hexagonal array.  In fact, my<br/>preferred &quot;keyboard&quot; now is definitely a Ztar, partly for economic<br/>reasons.  I might be able to afford one in the next year or so.</p><p>The site&apos;s all frames now, and my old MicroZone link&apos;s broken &lt;sob&gt;.<br/>So go to &lt;<a href="http://catalog.com/starrlab/">http://catalog.com/starrlab/</a>&gt;.  The other links I gave above<br/>do work, but don&apos;t give you the navigation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you haven&apos;t been following the Miracle discussion, I urge you<br/>to look<br/>&gt; &gt; back though it.  If there&apos;s something you don&apos;t understand, please<br/>ask.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no problem following the idea of a 7/72 generator.

For me and i<br/>&gt; imagine others this is not the case and one has to spend quite a<br/>time just mapping them out on<br/>&gt; paper. If one knows how.</p><p>I think the subject line is wrong.  It should be &quot;geometrical or<br/>arithmetical&quot;.  Geometry *is* mathematics.  Erv&apos;s ideas seem mostly<br/>aimed at reconciling the arithmetical and geometrical.</p><p>Yes, matrixes require a certain background, I find they are useful to<br/>me.  I&apos;ve used Excel&apos;s matrix functionality heavily for the Miracle<br/>background and also in looking at some other generators.  The<br/>important stuff for the Erlich-Keenan temperament I did on paper<br/>before I got the PC booted, but still using matrixes.</p><p>Most of the matrix work does on before the generalized keyboard layout<br/>becomes apparent.  So comparing the two isn&apos;t really appropriate.  By<br/>the time you get a keyboard mapping and template, you dont need the<br/>matrixes.</p><p>You can place notes on the lattice from their matrix representation,<br/>but it&apos;s still easier to see them on the lattice which is why I use a<br/>lattice.  You can also use matrixes to convert between specifications<br/>for a lattice and a generalized keyboard.  I find that useful, but<br/>mostly in theory because it isn&apos;t something I have to do very often.</p><p>            Graham</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>5/11/2001 1:32:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt; It has 30 hexanies and 30 tetrads</p><p>Graham wrote,</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s not Blackjack, then, but interesting.</p><p>Kraig (if I may be so bold as to step in and comment) is referring to<br/>the Eikosany with the 30 hexanies and 30 tetrads falling equally into<br/>the 15 categories</p><p>1-3-5-7<br/>1-3-5-9<br/>1-3-5-11<br/>1-3-7-9<br/>1-3-7-11<br/>1-3-9-11<br/>1-5-7-9<br/>1-5-7-11<br/>1-5-9-11<br/>1-7-9-11<br/>3-5-7-9<br/>3-5-7-11<br/>3-5-9-11<br/>3-7-9-11<br/>5-7-9-11</p><p>For each of the above, the Eikosany has 1 otonal tetrad, 1 utonal<br/>tetrad, and 2 hexanies.</p><p>The blackjack scale is very different in that it has far more<br/>hexanies and tetrads in the 1-3-5-7 category.

This is where the Art comes in.<br/>One other comment to others (including yourself of course too)<br/> While we can say that there are no bad scales, I do believe that there are inappropriate scales.<br/>Each scale has its plus and minuses and it is up to the artist sensitivity to take them by the<br/>rein. Not picking on anyone in particular, but when i hear a set of pieces running through all the<br/>ET&apos;s for instance and they basically sound the same, I feel that something about the scales are<br/>being overlooked. To give credit where credit is due, sometimes what is necessary is to jump in<br/>unprepared and have the courage to misunderstand and reflect on the outcome later. Often in<br/>retrospect enough is done to give one and others an idea just what a scale can do. It all boils<br/>down to what one wants to do and Dave&apos;s find offers allot to explore without a doubt. The eikosany<br/>is ideal for exploring a non tonal area with the use of acoustically relevant consonances. Dave<br/>scales will also do this in a more limited way but one will be able to do exact transpositions of<br/>much of the material to other pitch levels. Depending on what one wants to do, each scale is more<br/>appropriate than the other to do its each unique thing.</p><p><a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kraig wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; It has 30 hexanies and 30 tetrads<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s not Blackjack, then, but interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig (if I may be so bold as to step in and comment) is referring to<br/>&gt; the Eikosany with the 30 hexanies and 30 tetrads falling equally into<br/>&gt; the 15 categories<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1-3-5-7<br/>&gt; 1-3-5-9<br/>&gt; 1-3-5-11<br/>&gt; 1-3-7-9<br/>&gt; 1-3-7-11<br/>&gt; 1-3-9-11<br/>&gt; 1-5-7-9<br/>&gt; 1-5-7-11<br/>&gt; 1-5-9-11<br/>&gt; 1-7-9-11<br/>&gt; 3-5-7-9<br/>&gt; 3-5-7-11<br/>&gt; 3-5-9-11<br/>&gt; 3-7-9-11<br/>&gt; 5-7-9-11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For each of the above, the Eikosany has 1 otonal tetrad, 1 utonal<br/>&gt; tetrad, and 2 hexanies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The blackjack scale is very different in that it has far more<br/>&gt; hexanies and tetrads in the 1-3-5-7 category.

I still don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have it all worked out, that&apos;s why I&apos;d prefer you to help<br/>&gt; us on this instead of questioning why we&apos;re doing it.  Of<br/>&gt; course no physical keyboard exists specifically for the<br/>&gt; Erlich-Keenan temperament.  Even the theory didn&apos;t exist<br/>&gt; a fortnight ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The best existing keyboard looks like the Z-board<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://catalog.com/starrlab/keyboards2.html">http://catalog.com/starrlab/keyboards2.html</a>&gt;.  The way<br/>&gt; it&apos;s shaped it&apos;d be better to follow the lattice than<br/>&gt; the layout I gave above, but either would work better<br/>&gt; than on a hexagonal array.  In fact, my preferred<br/>&gt; &quot;keyboard&quot; now is definitely a Ztar, partly for economic<br/>&gt; reasons.  I might be able to afford one in the next year<br/>&gt; or so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The site&apos;s all frames now, and my old MicroZone link&apos;s<br/>&gt; broken &lt;sob&gt;.  So go to <a href="http://catalog.com/starrlab/">http://catalog.com/starrlab/</a>&gt;.<br/>&gt; The other links I gave above do work, but don&apos;t give you<br/>&gt; the navigation.</p><p>(I&apos;m glad Graham posted the link to the Zboard page,<br/>because the Starr Labs site no longer has a link to it.<br/>I&apos;m sure that&apos;s just a glitch... I&apos;ll mention it<br/>Monday and see if we can put it back in.  The Zboard<br/>is definitely still in production.)</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22476">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22476</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [David J. Finnamore]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... I&apos;m just going to have to rig up a way to play this<br/>&gt; tuning, that&apos;s all there is to it.</p><p>David, I felt exactly the same way.</p><p>Graham, I was so excited by this that I printed your<br/>post this morning and took it with me to work.  Harvey<br/>Starr and I had a good discussion about making available<br/>a controller that would easily map the blackjack/miracle<br/>scales.  Harvey knows a lot about his instruments but not<br/>a lot about tuning, and for me it&apos;s vice versa.</p><p>After thinking about it all day as I worked on the<br/>MicroZone, and some experimenting with Zboard and Ztar<br/>layouts after work, I decided to settle on mapping the<br/>entire 72-EDO superset to the Ztar keyboard.  This<br/>obviates the need to accomodate the odd periodicities of<br/>the  10+1, 21-, 31-, and 41-tone mappings, and in addition<br/>allows full modulation across the entire spectrum of pitches<br/>in this amazing family of tunings.</p><p>At first I tried mapping 72-EDO to the Zboard, which<br/>is a matrix of 12 x 23 = 276 keys.  Right away the<br/>fact that each column of keys is 12 deep suggested to<br/>me that a 12-EDO whole tone, divided into 12 1/12-tones,<br/>be mapped across the entire column.  This resulted in<br/>a 72-EDO adaptation of the van Janko keyboard layout,<br/>with a total range of just under 4 &quot;octaves&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to get around to making an illustration of<br/>what I did here.  Here&apos;s a quote describing a regular<br/>Janko keyboard, from<br/><a href="http://afs.wu-wien.ac.at/earlym-l/other.lists/piporg-l/PIPORG-">http://afs.wu-wien.ac.at/earlym-l/other.lists/piporg-l/PIPORG-</a><br/>L.LOG9602E</p><p>(use copy and paste to remove the line break)</p><p>&gt; Date:         Wed, 28 Feb 1996 15:29:17 -0500<br/>&gt; Sender:       Pipe Organs and Related Topics<br/>&gt;                  &lt;<a href="mailto:PIPORG-L@CNSIBM.ALBANY.EDU">PIPORG-L@CNSIBM.ALBANY.EDU</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; From:         Paul Opel &lt;<a href="mailto:POpel@sover.net">POpel@sover.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject:      Re: Janko keyboards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul von Janko&apos;, Hungarian pianist and inventor (1856-1919),<br/>&gt; invented the eponymous keyboard layout.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; from an Baker&apos;s, 5th ed.:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; His keyboard, invented in 1882, is really a new departure<br/>&gt;&gt; in piano-mechanics, though standing in distant relationship<br/>&gt;&gt; the older &apos;chromatic&apos; keyboard advocated by the society<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;Chroma&apos;.  It has six rows of keys in steplike succession;<br/>&gt;&gt; the arrangement of the two lowest rows (typical of the<br/>&gt;&gt; other two pairs) is as follows:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;        Second row:   c#   d#   F    G    A    B<br/>&gt;&gt;        Lowest row: C    D    E   f#   g#   a#    C<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; the capitals representing white keys, and the small letters<br/>&gt;&gt; black ones.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The 3rd and 4th rows, and the 5th and 6th rows, are mere<br/>&gt;&gt; duplications of the 1st and 2nd; and corresponding keys<br/>&gt;&gt; in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th rows, and in the 2nd, 4th, and<br/>&gt;&gt; 6th rows, are on one and the same key-lever, so that<br/>&gt;&gt; any note can be struck in three different places.  The<br/>&gt;&gt; fingering of all diatonic scales is alike; chromatic<br/>&gt;&gt; scales are played by striking alternative keys in any<br/>&gt;&gt; two adjoining rows.  A full description of the keyboard<br/>&gt;&gt; was published in pamphlet form by its inventor (1886)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [then follows a bibliography of articles up to 1905]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I remember, the keys are the same width as standard<br/>&gt; white keys, making the octave span smaller- so much the<br/>&gt; worse for keyspan chests!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do not find any listing for the &apos;Chroma&apos; society- but<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have ready access to the New Grove.  Anyone have<br/>&gt; anything further?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Opel<br/>&gt;</p><p>The major drawback to the Zboard mapping was that it<br/>was quite a stretch of the hand to play some chords<br/>that had notes in both the front and back rows.  Also,<br/>the Janko layout is not as familiar, and seemed downright<br/>odd with the microtonal adaptation.</p><p>So I decided to try mapping 72-EDO to the Ztar, which<br/>has 6 x 24 = 144 keys.  This to me worked much better,<br/>because each column represented a semitone and the<br/>alternation of black and white keys could be made to<br/>more closely resemble the familiar Halberstadt layout.<br/>Here&apos;s the beginning of the mapping:</p><p>I&apos;ve made a very realistic JPEG of this mapping<br/>and included it at the end of my Dictionary entry<br/>for 72-EDO:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/72edo.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/72edo.htm</a></p><p>The total range is 2 audio &quot;octaves&quot;.</p><p>One of the drawbacks to all these instruments is that<br/>they are expensive.  Since I&apos;m not much of a guitarist<br/>and frankly don&apos;t need the guitar-like aspects of the<br/>Ztar, I asked Harvey about the possibility of making<br/>an instrument that consisted pretty much of just the<br/>Ztar fingerboard.  He said that he gets quite a number<br/>of requests for this, so I&apos;m pretty sure that he&apos;s going<br/>to start manufacturing them like that.  This should<br/>bring the price down a bit, hopefully around the $1000<br/>range - a great deal more affordable than the $8800<br/>MicroZone.</p><p>Go to the Starr Labs site and click on &quot;Custom Designs&quot;,<br/>then scroll down to where it says &quot;Y10 Standalone MIDI controller<br/>module shown with a plug-in Ztar fingerboard<br/>attached.&quot;  The accompanying picture shows a stand-alone<br/>Ztar fingerboard.  This is very much along the lines of<br/>what Harvey and I discussed.</p><p>I think it would be a great improvement to extend the<br/>Ztar mapping so that more audio &quot;octaves&quot; could be<br/>accomodated.  The Zboard would actually work fine in<br/>this regard, as it&apos;s columns can simply be divided in<br/>half, with the same patterns of black and white keys<br/>in both halves, and one sounding an &quot;octave&quot; above/below<br/>the other.  If Harvey carries out his intention to expand<br/>the Zboard to 12 x 24 = 288 keys, this would give a total<br/>range of 4 &quot;octaves&quot;.</p><p>Graham&apos;s right: between the Ztar and the Zboard, we&apos;ve<br/>already got a couple of great instruments crying out to<br/>be tuned to these &quot;miracle&quot; scales.</p><p>(I&apos;ve also wondered about mapping 144-EDO to the Ztar,<br/>since the keys are already set up for it.)</p><p>Lastly, I tried mapping 72-EDO to the MicroZone, but<br/>alas, it didn&apos;t work very well.  I&apos;ve seen commentary<br/>here by Kraig, Paul, and Graham about this, but would<br/>really love to see it explained comprehensively.  I could<br/>see in the mapping attempt I made that the problem was<br/>that because of the hexagonal key shape, the same interval<br/>relationships did not hold when traveling from key to<br/>key in a particular direction.</p><p>All of the Starr Labs instruments allow comprehensive<br/>MIDI capabilites, including the ability to map any<br/>MIDI note number to any key.  All the instruments also<br/>make use of &quot;zones&quot;, which can be anywhere from a single<br/>key to the entire keyboard, and can overlap if desired.</p><p>With me working together with Harvey on instruments that<br/>serve the needs of the microtonal community, we may end up<br/>with some really useable and affordable instruments.  It&apos;s<br/>up to us now to make the financial investment so that he<br/>can afford to produce these things.</p><p>I&apos;ve had the idea that maybe we could have some sort of<br/>fundraiser to accumulate enough money to get prototypes<br/>up and running.

(??)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Weeeell, I&apos;m not sure that a 72-EDO instrument really deserves<br/>&gt; to be classified as &quot;MIRACLE&quot;. 72 notes per octave is just way<br/>&gt; too many.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most folks want more than one and a bit octaves on their<br/>&gt; instrument and to fit their fingers between frets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point of the MIRACLE generator is that you need less than<br/>&gt; a third of that, with double the minimum stepsize, to get a<br/>&gt; really big chunk of the 11-limit, and an even bigger chunk of<br/>&gt; the 9-limit and a bigger chunk again of the 7-limit. (But you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t get any more 5-limit or 3-limit than the subsets available<br/>&gt; at the 7-limit).</p><p>Good points, Dave.  But keep in mind that the Starr Labs<br/>instruments are only MIDI controllers, with no sound source,<br/>so it&apos;s trivial to program the keys to any pitches desired.</p><p>The Miracle-31 or Blackjack scales could both be mapped to<br/>the Ztar and have plenty of keys left over for greater range.</p><p>And on the subject of range, the Ztars that are already in<br/>production have a 6 x 24 layout, so even in 72-EDO they<br/>produce a full 2 &quot;octaves&quot;, and the Zboard is 12 x 23, which<br/>will probably become 12 x 24, giving a 4-&quot;octave&quot; range<br/>in 72-EDO.  That&apos;s not shabby at all, only one &quot;octave&quot; less<br/>than most regular Halberstadt-layout electronic keyboards.<br/>(Does &quot;61-key keyboard&quot; ring a bell to anyone?)</p><p>I haven&apos;t given it much thought, but a quick first attempt<br/>at mapping Blackjack-21 to the Ztar with no wasted keys<br/>might work like this (giving 72-EDO degrees and notation):</p><p> 7 C#+   28 F&lt;    49 G#+   70 C&lt;<br/> 2 C&gt;    23 E-    44 G&gt;    65 B-    etc.<br/> 0 C     21 Eb^   42 G     63 Bb^    .<br/>70 C&lt;    16 Eb&lt;   37 F#+   58 Bb&lt;    .<br/>65 B-    14 D&gt;    35 F#-   56 A&gt;     .<br/>63 Bb^    9 C#^   30 F     51 G#^   0 C</p><p>I could actually see this as being a *very* playable arrangement.<br/>For example, look how comfortably the fingers would lie over<br/>a ~4:5:6:7 tetrad on C:</p><p>         23 E-<br/> 0 C              42 G<br/>                           58 Bb&lt;</p><p>or conversely, a ~1/(4:5:6:7) tetrad with a &quot;root&quot; of C#+<br/>or &quot;guide tone&quot; of B-:</p><p> 7 C#+<br/>         23 E-             65 B-<br/>                  42 G</p><p>The only disadvantage I can see in this mapping is that the<br/>pattern shifts down by 3 keys at the first repetition then<br/>back up to the origin point at the next repetition, so it<br/>gives the appearance of having two chains.  But I think one<br/>could easily get used to that, because it&apos;s still a quite<br/>regular pattern.</p><p>And this mapping gives a range that is only 3 notes shy of<br/>7 &quot;octaves&quot; on the Ztar - quite enough for real musical use,<br/>and just a tiny bit less than the 7&amp;1/3 &quot;octaves&quot; of a full<br/>piano, but in format that is a *LOT* more portable!</p><p>Alternatively, since Blackjack can also be viewed as 3<br/>7-tone MOSs, it might be mapped with one &quot;octave&quot; above<br/>and the other below, like this:</p><p> 7 C#+   16 Eb&lt;   28 F&lt;    37 F#+   49 G#+   58 Bb&lt;   70 C&lt;<br/> 2 C&gt;    14 D&gt;    23 E-    35 F#-   44 G&gt;    56 A&gt;    65 B-<br/> 0 C      9 C#^   21 Eb^   30 F     42 G     51 G#^   63 Bb^<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/> 7 C#+   16 Eb&lt;   28 F&lt;    37 F#+   49 G#+   58 Bb&lt;   70 C&lt;<br/> 2 C&gt;    14 D&gt;    23 E-    35 F#-   44 G&gt;    56 A&gt;    65 B-<br/> 0 C      9 C#^   21 Eb^   30 F     42 G     51 G#^   63 Bb^  etc.</p><p>This gives a strictly regular key pattern, altho at first<br/>glance I don&apos;t like it as much as the one above.</p><p>Hmmm... I should give some thought to how the Miracle-31<br/>might be mapped onto a Ztar.  Now *that* would be a fantastic<br/>instrument.

Well, I&apos;ve found a way of tuning the strings on my meantone guitar<br/>to suit Miracle temperament.

After<br/>playing it melodically for a while, I quite like it.  I&apos;ve even found some<br/>good chords, although not with all strings.  One thing you have to watch<br/>out for is that G-B becomes a tritone, so melodic steps between them<br/>become expanded.</p><p>I also find that playing the open strings through some warm distortion<br/>sounds quite good.

For the Ztar, try<br/>emulating a Blackjack fretting with the &quot;wolf&quot; placed to give both a minor<br/>third and perfect fourth, as I showed before.</p><p>&gt; So now my question is: what extra 5 notes would be the<br/>&gt; best ones to add to the Miracle scale to fill in the blank<br/>&gt; spots on my Ztar layout?</p><p>It partly depends on what 31 note scale you&apos;re working with.
