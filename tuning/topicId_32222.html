Call me<br/>old fashioned, but the part with the parallel fifths in the<br/>middle of the piece realy stood out (in a positive way). I<br/>really like the sound of familiar harmonic material moving in<br/>new melodic manners.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Fafner&quot; is based on the 17TET version of an augmented scale. The<br/>&gt; major third is generator, stepsizes are 1 and 4 in the structure<br/>&gt; sLsLssLs. Some parts contain other pitches.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve explored the scale (with less success than you) in its 31et<br/>version (stepsizes 2 and 7). I think I got too hung up on the<br/>neutral thirds, which don&apos;t seem super pervasive in your piece.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to give it some more listens, thanks a lot.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
