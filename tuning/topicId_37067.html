Except they seem to be protecting their investment in the material. Whatever.</p><p>And, especially since I may have time over the next few weeks to catch up on some reading, maybe this would have been good, and I&apos;d try to be objective. What hurtz is that the objectivity is hard to maintain when the first paragraph of the abstract is so pointedly (and erroneously) slanted that I wonder how any faculty committee would approve the paper. First two sentences:</p><p>&quot;In Part 1 the author compares the three primary rationales behind modern microtonalism, in an attempt to assess their artistic and theoretical integrity. These rationales are: a belief in just intonation, an interest in exotic tunings, and an urge simply to add pitches.&quot;</p><p>So she is going to &quot;compare&quot; a belief, an interest, and an urge. Hard to do when you&apos;ve already laid down a pejorative gauntlet. And then the sentence comes that stops me in my particular tracks:</p><p>&quot;The author concludes that just intonation and exotic tunings do not provide convincing rationales for microtonal composition, while a simple creative impulse to add pitches does, and that only a fully functional microtonal equal temperament (the third of the three methods) enables a composer to develop a genuinely microtonal music.&quot;</p><p>Therefore, Harry Partch has failed to develop a &quot;genuinely microtonal music&quot;. Ditto Lou Harrison. And many others.</p><p>Simply adding pitches in between the 12tET yard markers is the only way to go. And, from Joe P.&apos;s comments, not just any usage, but some pre/pro-scribed method, which only reading the rest of the paper will illuminate.</p><p>That kind of illumination I can pass on for the moment. In the meantime, I&apos;m going to look for that article in PNM that Bill Sethares pointed out (if it is simple a printing of the doctoral paper I&apos;ll take a pass).</p><p>Some doctors are quacks.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; <a href="mailto:jonszanto@yahoo.com">jonszanto@yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2002 6:27:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
