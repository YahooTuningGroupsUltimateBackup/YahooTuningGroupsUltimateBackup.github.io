For instance, if we<br/>say something like &quot;there are two generators, and one of them is 2/1<br/>and the other is 3/2, and four of the 3/2&apos;s map to 5/1,&quot; that uniquely<br/>specifies 5-limit meantone temperament. This is the same thing as<br/>stating &quot;81/80 vanishes&quot;, due to some mathematical identities that are<br/>very deep. Any set of vanishing commas can automagically be turned<br/>into a mapping and vice versa.</p><p>Some people use the word &quot;temperament&quot; to mean something else, so to<br/>clarify these are the things I called &quot;temperament families.&quot; But for<br/>now I&apos;m going to call them &quot;temperament classes&quot; instead. This is<br/>because Gene has another object called a &quot;temperament family&quot; which is<br/>really like a &quot;temperament family family&quot; under the old notation; it<br/>tells how different temperament classes interrelate and evolve into<br/>one another. So the thing I called &quot;temperament family&quot; and also<br/>&quot;abstract temperament,&quot; which we just call &quot;temperament&quot; sometimes, I<br/>will call &quot;temperament class&quot; from now on to make it clear. Again,<br/>note that it&apos;s not the same thing you called a temperament.</p><p>That being said, the really important point is that our &quot;temperament<br/>classes&quot; don&apos;t have a defined range of &quot;valid tunings.&quot; For instance,<br/>the meantone temperament class isn&apos;t only valid for octaves around<br/>1200 cents and generators around 696 cents. You can tune the octaves<br/>to 1 cent and the fifths to 120837102873 cents if you want, so long as<br/>you make sure that one of these &quot;octaves&quot; is still being called 2/1,<br/>that one of these &quot;fifths&quot; is still being mapped as 3/2, and that four<br/>&quot;fifths&quot; is still being mapped to 5/1. So different temperament<br/>classes can be assigned different &quot;tuning maps,&quot; and there is no limit<br/>on which tuning maps are mathematically acceptable. However, different<br/>tuning maps can be -rated- by how much &quot;error&quot; they have. So for<br/>instance, the tuning map corresponding to 1 cent octaves and<br/>120837102873 cent fifths would have an absurdly high error - so high<br/>that nobody would ever use it. You&apos;d be better off setting the octaves<br/>to 1200 cents and the fifths to 696 cents, which has much lower error.</p><p>You may ask, why the heck would we want to do it this way? That&apos;s<br/>musically useless, isn&apos;t it? Don&apos;t we want to assign temperament<br/>classes some kind of &quot;valid tuning range?&quot; And the answer is yes -<br/>mapping 120837102873 cents as 3/2 is almost certainly musically<br/>useless. But, if you think about it, it makes more sense to do it this<br/>way, because nobody can agree on what the valid tuning range is - so<br/>we&apos;ll just let anyone tune things how they like, see what the error is<br/>for each tuning, and make their own judgments.</p><p>For instance, there&apos;s mavila temperament, for instance, which says<br/>that four fifths minus two octaves maps to 6/5, not to 5/4 - a similar<br/>tuning as to what gamelan and balafon ensembles use. This leads to<br/>very flat fifths, around 675 cents. Some people have no problem saying<br/>that those 675 cent fifths are 3/2, others insist that it&apos;s actually<br/>more like 28/19 or what have you. Who&apos;s right and who&apos;s wrong? The<br/>answer is, nobody&apos;s right and nobody&apos;s wrong. We trust that people can<br/>make their own decisions. You can map it as 3/2, and just note that<br/>that 3/2 is going to have really high error. Or, you can map it as<br/>28/19, and it&apos;ll be lower error. It&apos;s up to you.</p><p>The take home point is that we&apos;re not naming tunings, just mappings.<br/>So Margo, what are you naming, specifically? Specific scales of<br/>specific tunings of mappings, or something more abstract?</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105216 href="#105216">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2012 4:29:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You may ask, why the heck would we want to do it this<br/>&gt; way?

For instance, if<br/>&gt;  we say something like &quot;there are two generators, and one of them is<br/>&gt;  2/1 and the other is 3/2, and four of the 3/2&apos;s map to 5/1,&quot; that<br/>&gt;  uniquely specifies 5-limit meantone temperament. This is the same<br/>&gt;  thing as stating &quot;81/80 vanishes&quot;, due to some mathematical<br/>&gt;  identities that are very deep. Any set of vanishing commas can<br/>&gt;  automagically be turned into a mapping and vice versa.</p><p>This is a good example. And there are the kinds of strange mappings,<br/>or implementations, that Graham gets into also</p><p>For example, when I was getting started, people would sometimes talk<br/>about &quot;positive meantones&quot; with the tempering of the fifth given as a<br/>_negative_ syntonic comma value. For a totally hypothetical example,<br/>suppose that the nearer fifths of George Secor&apos;s 17-tone<br/>well-temperament at 707.220 cents were somehow described as &quot;close to<br/>-1/4-comma meantone&quot;!</p><p>The obvious reply: &quot;That&apos;s the wrong comma -- it&apos;s actually close to<br/>1/5-Archyan comma, as shown by the small semitones or thirdtones<br/>around 64 cents, very close to 28/27.&quot;</p><p>But I get the point that in theory, one _could_ call this -1/4-comma<br/>meantone or whatever: the mapping defines the temperament, however<br/>curious the implementation.</p><p>Are we on the same wavelength, here?</p><p>&gt;  Some people use the word &quot;temperament&quot; to mean something else, so<br/>&gt;  to clarify these are the things I called &quot;temperament families.&quot;<br/>&gt;  But for now I&apos;m going to call them &quot;temperament classes&quot;<br/>&gt;  instead. This is because Gene has another object called a<br/>&gt;  &quot;temperament family&quot; which is really like a &quot;temperament family<br/>&gt;  family&quot; under the old notation; it tells how different temperament<br/>&gt;  classes interrelate and evolve into one another. So the thing I<br/>&gt;  called &quot;temperament family&quot; and also &quot;abstract temperament,&quot; which<br/>&gt;  we just call &quot;temperament&quot; sometimes, I will call &quot;temperament<br/>&gt;  class&quot; from now on to make it clear. Again, note that it&apos;s not the<br/>&gt;  same thing you called a temperament.</p><p>Actually, there&apos;s a possible example of what _might_ be a &quot;temperament<br/>family&quot; (or maybe &quot;temperament clan,&quot; recalling a term someone used<br/>for a superfamily of galaxies in a novel called _Tau Zero_) that I&apos;ve<br/>been advocating for some years. Let&apos;s see if this is an example of<br/>what Gene has in mind.</p><p>As I learned around the year 2000, the term &quot;meantone&quot; tends to<br/>suggest specifically tempering out the 81:80, as opposed to the 64:63<br/>or 896:891 whatever, as a way to map four 5ths up to 5/4 specifically,<br/>rather than 9/7 or 14/11 or whatever.</p><p>Suppose we chose the term &quot;eventone&quot; as a more general temperament<br/>family name for a set of classes where 4 fifths up represents some<br/>kind of regular major third: 5/4, 9/7, 14/11, you name it. The classes<br/>within that family could meantone for 5/4; superpyth (if I&apos;m right)<br/>for 9/7; parapyth for 14/11; and so forth.</p><p>In fact, this precisely ties in with Jake&apos;s original post about &quot;Three<br/>similar temperaments&quot; for 5/4, 9/7, or 14/11 major thirds -- a similar<br/>structure, but with different thirds and, more specifically, commas!<br/>So my proposal would be to call that structure or mapping &quot;eventone,&quot;<br/>and the GWS &quot;temperament family&quot; or group of classes the eventone<br/>family.</p><p>&gt;  That being said, the really important point is that our<br/>&gt;  &quot;temperament classes&quot; don&apos;t have a defined range of &quot;valid<br/>&gt;  tunings.&quot; For instance, the meantone temperament class isn&apos;t only<br/>&gt;  valid for octaves around 1200 cents and generators around 696<br/>&gt;  cents. You can tune the octaves to 1 cent and the fifths to<br/>&gt;  120837102873 cents if you want, so long as you make sure that one<br/>&gt;  of these &quot;octaves&quot; is still being called 2/1, that one of these<br/>&gt;  &quot;fifths&quot; is still being mapped as 3/2, and that four &quot;fifths&quot; is<br/>&gt;  still being mapped to 5/1. So different temperament classes can be<br/>&gt;  assigned different &quot;tuning maps,&quot; and there is no limit on which<br/>&gt;  tuning maps are mathematically acceptable. However, different<br/>&gt;  tuning maps can be -rated- by how much &quot;error&quot; they have. So for<br/>&gt;  instance, the tuning map corresponding to 1 cent octaves and<br/>&gt;  120837102873 cent fifths would have an absurdly high error - so<br/>&gt;  high that nobody would ever use it.</p><p>Well, among other things, anyone who used it must have a taste for<br/>really wide voice spacing, a bit beyond the usual 16th-century<br/>part-writing conventions of Zarlino or Morley &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>But I get the point of an abstract template or mapping where we can<br/>pour in any values we want.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like Gene&apos;s great example of pouring the POTE Parapyth<br/>generators into the mapping of my MET-24 -- it could have been O3, or<br/>Peppermint for that matter, and the result would have been the same.<br/>This may be a bit different, though, because what MET-24 gave was the<br/>2x12-MOS form -- we agree that a lattice is potentially infinite in<br/>all of the relevant dimensions, e.g. 2x17-MOS, or 2x29-MOS, etc.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;d be better off setting the octaves to 1200 cents and the fifths<br/>&gt; to 696 cents, which has much lower error.  You may ask, why the heck<br/>&gt; would we want to do it this way? That&apos;s musically useless, isn&apos;t it?<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t we want to assign temperament classes some kind of &quot;valid<br/>&gt; tuning range?&quot; And the answer is yes - mapping 120837102873 cents as<br/>&gt; 3/2 is almost certainly musically useless. But, if you think about<br/>&gt; it, it makes more sense to do it this way, because nobody can agree<br/>&gt; on what the valid tuning range is - so we&apos;ll just let anyone tune<br/>&gt; things how they like, see what the error is for each tuning, and<br/>&gt; make their own judgments.</p><p>We&apos;re much in agreement -- and Graham nicely addresses this too --<br/>that it&apos;s good to separate defining a structure from debating what are<br/>good, bad, marginal, or optimal parameters. Better a descriptive than<br/>a prescriptive approach!</p><p>If we agree that descriptive rather than prescriptive is a good thing,<br/>the one argument that occurs to me from another perspective is that<br/>sometimes a bit of optional and friendly taxonomy might not hurt,<br/>although there&apos;s the counterargument that taxonomy can quickly become<br/>controversial at best and prescriptive in a very unpleasant way at<br/>worst.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that someone tunes a rank-2 temperament at 707.8<br/>cents and calls it &quot;a syntonic comma temperament.&quot; Believe it or not,<br/>some people came up with a theoretical system which did just about<br/>exactly this, classifying any mapping from 7-EDO to 5-EDO with four<br/>5ths up representing a major third as &quot;syntonic.&quot;</p><p>Now a prescriptive approach would say, &quot;That&apos;s a horrible attempt at a<br/>meantone; you&apos;re totally outside the valid range, which surely ends<br/>by the time we reach a just 3/2!&quot;</p><p>I understand the RMP approach might say, &quot;You&apos;ve chosen values with a<br/>very high error for a meantone or syntonic comma temperament, but yes,<br/>you _can_ call it that as long as the mapping is there.&quot;</p><p>And a &quot;gentle taxonomy&quot; appraach might say, &quot;You&apos;ve chosen a fine<br/>temperament where, like a meantone or syntonic temperament, we map a<br/>major third to four 5ths up. But generally we call that a superpyth or<br/>Archytan comma temperament, because here you seem to be tempering out<br/>64/63 rather than 81/80. Note, for example, that your major second<br/>from 2 fifths up is 215.6 cents, somewhere between 9/8 and 8/7.<br/>In a meantone, we&apos;d expect it to be between 10/9 and 9/8. So I wonder<br/>if this is meant to be an unusual meantone, or a very fine superpyth.&quot;</p><p>In other words, if someone thinks they are speaking standard French<br/>but what we hear is an excellent standard Spanish, a bit of friendly<br/>taxonomy might be helpful, &quot;That would be a rather curious French, but<br/>sounds like the Spanish of a native of Ecuador!&quot;</p><p>A compromise between these two descriptive viewpoints: how about a set<br/>of sample tunings for each temperament class, including the POTE and<br/>TOP, and also some others showing a variety of &quot;styles&apos; -- not to stop<br/>people from doing something a bit different, but to give an idea of<br/>the usual ranges of variation even while leaving the class itself<br/>abstract, and not subject to any limits.</p><p>&gt; For instance, there&apos;s mavila temperament,</p><p>&gt; for instance, which says that four fifths minus two octaves maps to<br/>&gt; 6/5, not to 5/4 - a similar tuning as to what gamelan and balafon<br/>&gt; ensembles use. This leads to very flat fifths, around 675 cents.</p><p>Yes, a bit like pelog fifths. My experience is that a bit of<br/>timbre manipulation can make these sound quite &quot;3/2-ish&quot; --<br/>I haven&apos;t tried this with Mavila, but with 23-EDO, for example.<br/>And 11-EDO seems to be right on the edge of possibility, at least<br/>with my crude timbral techniques.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/RhapsodyForDanStearns1.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/RhapsodyForDanStearns1.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Some people have no problem saying that those 675 cent fifths are<br/>&gt; 3/2, others insist that it&apos;s actually more like 28/19 or what have<br/>&gt; you. Who&apos;s right and who&apos;s wrong? The answer is, nobody&apos;s right and<br/>&gt; nobody&apos;s wrong. We trust that people can make their own decisions.</p><p>The best policy! I&apos;m familiar with this debate about fifths around 675<br/>cents, for example in relation to 16-EDO, where claims were sometimes<br/>heard that Easley Blackwood was &quot;wrong&quot; about 675 cents being a<br/>recognizable fifth. My own experience with 23-EDO tells me he was<br/>right -- but a theory of temperament might want wisely to let people<br/>agree on a framework and carry on the debates from there.</p><p>&gt; You can map it as 3/2, and just note that that 3/2 is going to have<br/>&gt; really high error. Or, you can map it as 28/19, and it&apos;ll be lower<br/>&gt; error. It&apos;s up to you.  The take home point is that we&apos;re not naming<br/>&gt; tunings, just mappings.  So Margo, what are you naming,<br/>&gt; specifically? Specific scales of specific tunings of mappings, or<br/>&gt; something more abstract?  Thanks, Mike</p><p>The answer is that most of the time, I&apos;m simply naming a specific<br/>scale, or maybe better gamut, the kind that a Scala file defines:<br/>Peppermint (2/1 and 704.096-cent fifth courtesy of Kennan Pepper), O3,<br/>MET-24, etc.</p><p>And understand, under the old paradigm that I grew up with, so to<br/>speak, we wouldn&apos;t even ask the question, &quot;What are you describing, a<br/>tuning or a mapping or an abstract temperament.&quot; Back then, a tuning<br/>was pretty much a tuning, and the presumption was that you were<br/>describing something definable in a Scala file.</p><p>But, in retrospect, _mappings_ were often the essence of what was<br/>going on.</p><p>For example, my e-based temperament in 2000 -- &quot;temperament&quot; meaning<br/>at that time simply a tuning system (2/1, 704.607 cents) -- had<br/>mappings which included four 5ths up as a regular major third at 14/11<br/>(896/891); and 15 fifths up as a 7/4 minor seventh (14680064/14348907).<br/>The last mapping didn&apos;t seem much on the radar screens at the time:<br/>people might recommend 1/4-comma or Kornerup or whatever for 7, or<br/>else 22-EDO or the like. &quot;Temper the fifths at around 704.5-705.0<br/>cents, and use 15 fifths up as 7/4,&quot; wasn&apos;t such a familiar idea, as<br/>far as I could see at the time.</p><p>But&apos;s let&apos;s consider that 14/11 mapping.</p><p>Now the textbooks and articles on &quot;multiple divisions&quot; (EDO&apos;s in<br/>today&apos;s parlsance) would address 46-EDO from a 2-3-5 perspective, but<br/>just try to find even a brief mention in that literature, &quot;One notable<br/>property of the 46-tone division is that 14/11 is virtually just.&quot;</p><p>So, in retrospect, it&apos;s a new mapping. And this can make a difference<br/>for newbies and others.</p><p>If a &quot;major third&quot; always means the best approximation of 5/4 in a<br/>given system, then 46-EDO is &quot;hard&quot; for a newbie because of the<br/>complex mapping; but, assuming the newbie is used to a major third at<br/>around the range of 5/4-400 cents, say, finding a congenial style is<br/>&quot;easy&quot; once the mapping becomes familiar (and maybe some comma pumps<br/>are finessed or deliberately exploited).</p><p>If a &quot;major third&quot; in 46-EDO Gentle maps to 14/11, then the &quot;newbie&quot;<br/>will find it easy to navigate the system -- no different than in<br/>meantone, just a different major third and comma. However, to use RMP<br/>terminology -- and this is my turn to practice being descriptive<br/>rather than prescriptive -- someone wanting to play meantone-like<br/>music premised on a major third of 5/4-400 cents may find this mapping<br/>rather high in its level of error, let us say.</p><p>And then the question might be one of either manipulating timbre to<br/>&quot;tame&quot; those wide major thirds (as Ivor Darreg did with an instrument<br/>for 17-EDO), or looking into a different musical style where active<br/>thirds will fit just fine -- e.g. Machaut rather than Palestrina or<br/>even Bach.</p><p>But from an RMP perspective, I guess, we just name the possible<br/>mappings and commas, and let people decide what fits.

It&apos;s probably better described as 1/5-comma superpyth<br/>or something, but you could call it -1/4-comma meantone if you want.</p><p>&gt; As I learned around the year 2000, the term &quot;meantone&quot; tends to<br/>&gt; suggest specifically tempering out the 81:80, as opposed to the 64:63<br/>&gt; or 896:891 whatever, as a way to map four 5ths up to 5/4 specifically,<br/>&gt; rather than 9/7 or 14/11 or whatever.</p><p>Right, exactly.</p><p>&gt; Suppose we chose the term &quot;eventone&quot; as a more general temperament<br/>&gt; family name for a set of classes where 4 fifths up represents some<br/>&gt; kind of regular major third: 5/4, 9/7, 14/11, you name it. The classes<br/>&gt; within that family could meantone for 5/4; superpyth (if I&apos;m right)<br/>&gt; for 9/7; parapyth for 14/11; and so forth.</p><p>So one thing is that RMP is agnostic on interval categories like<br/>&quot;major third&quot;; the only thing it&apos;s mapping is ratios. What counts as a<br/>major third, for instance? Is 13/10 a major third or a perfect fourth?<br/>Is 16/13 a major third? Is major thirdness an inherently perceptual<br/>thing or a culturally learned thing? From RMP&apos;s perspective, there&apos;s<br/>nothing special that inherently groups 5/4, 9/7, and 14/11 together<br/>(or 7/6 and 6/5 together, or 8/7 and 9/8 and 10/9 together, etc). In<br/>fact, there are temperaments that perceptually group 7/6 and 8/7<br/>together, and ones which distinguish abruptly between 7/6 and 6/5 .</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t mind calling temperaments where the optimal tuning yields<br/>an LLsLLLs MOS &quot;eventone.&quot; But my question is, how does this sort of<br/>classification/family scheme tie over to other temperaments where the<br/>generator might not even be 3/2, for instance? Many of the more<br/>interesting temperaments aren&apos;t generated by 3/2, such as porcupine,<br/>for instance. Others, such as hedgehog in 22-EDO (the scale is 3 3 2 3<br/>3 3 2 3) so abruptly distinguish 7/6 and 6/5 that they don&apos;t<br/>perceptually seem to aggregate into the same interval class at all,<br/>and yet 11/9 and 6/5 now sound like intonational variants of the same<br/>thing. How do we organize these types of temperaments into families?</p><p>&gt; In fact, this precisely ties in with Jake&apos;s original post about &quot;Three<br/>&gt; similar temperaments&quot; for 5/4, 9/7, or 14/11 major thirds -- a similar<br/>&gt; structure, but with different thirds and, more specifically, commas!<br/>&gt; So my proposal would be to call that structure or mapping &quot;eventone,&quot;<br/>&gt; and the GWS &quot;temperament family&quot; or group of classes the eventone<br/>&gt; family.</p><p>So in this case, Gene&apos;s temperament families deal with higher-limit<br/>extensions of temperament classes into new ones. For instance, there&apos;s<br/>2.3.5 meantone, which eliminates 81/80. There are then a number of<br/>7-limit &quot;extensions&quot;: one which eliminates 126/125, so that C-A# is<br/>now 7/4; one which eliminates 36/35, so that C-Bb is now 7/4; one<br/>which eliminates 525/512 so that C-Bbb is 7/4, etc. Then for each of<br/>those there are further 11-limit extensions and so on. All of these<br/>are different nodes in the meantone family. I&apos;m currently trying to<br/>extend this so that instead of always going from 5-limit to 7-limit to<br/>11-limit and so on, we can also go from the 2.3.7 subgroup to the full<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> limit as an extension, or from 2.3.11 to <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> to<br/>2.3.5.7.11, or something like that.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a bit like Gene&apos;s great example of pouring the POTE Parapyth<br/>&gt; generators into the mapping of my MET-24 -- it could have been O3, or<br/>&gt; Peppermint for that matter, and the result would have been the same.<br/>&gt; This may be a bit different, though, because what MET-24 gave was the<br/>&gt; 2x12-MOS form -- we agree that a lattice is potentially infinite in<br/>&gt; all of the relevant dimensions, e.g. 2x17-MOS, or 2x29-MOS, etc.</p><p>Right so, are MET-24, O3, and Peppermint the names of specific scales?<br/>Or specific mappings? Also, is a tuning specified?</p><p>&gt; If we agree that descriptive rather than prescriptive is a good thing,<br/>&gt; the one argument that occurs to me from another perspective is that<br/>&gt; sometimes a bit of optional and friendly taxonomy might not hurt,<br/>&gt; although there&apos;s the counterargument that taxonomy can quickly become<br/>&gt; controversial at best and prescriptive in a very unpleasant way at<br/>&gt; worst.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t mind a taxonomy of the different tunings that a temperament<br/>offers, though I&apos;m not sure how to classify them in a way that applies<br/>to all of the strange and exotic temperament classes that are out<br/>there.</p><p>&gt; Suppose, for example, that someone tunes a rank-2 temperament at 707.8<br/>&gt; cents and calls it &quot;a syntonic comma temperament.&quot; Believe it or not,<br/>&gt; some people came up with a theoretical system which did just about<br/>&gt; exactly this, classifying any mapping from 7-EDO to 5-EDO with four<br/>&gt; 5ths up representing a major third as &quot;syntonic.&quot;</p><p>Right, I&apos;m familiar with this &quot;syntonic temperament&quot; name. That&apos;s a<br/>good example of why I think it makes more sense to keep the naming of<br/>mappings and tunings separate. And if you&apos;re going to name tunings,<br/>don&apos;t name them after vanishing commas which imply mappings!</p><p>&gt; And a &quot;gentle taxonomy&quot; appraach might say, &quot;You&apos;ve chosen a fine<br/>&gt; temperament where, like a meantone or syntonic temperament, we map a<br/>&gt; major third to four 5ths up. But generally we call that a superpyth or<br/>&gt; Archytan comma temperament, because here you seem to be tempering out<br/>&gt; 64/63 rather than 81/80. Note, for example, that your major second<br/>&gt; from 2 fifths up is 215.6 cents, somewhere between 9/8 and 8/7.<br/>&gt; In a meantone, we&apos;d expect it to be between 10/9 and 9/8. So I wonder<br/>&gt; if this is meant to be an unusual meantone, or a very fine superpyth.&quot;</p><p>Right; I think that most people do this intuitively. In my head, for<br/>instance, if the fifth gets sharp of 12-EDO it&apos;s superpyth, and if<br/>it&apos;s flat of 12-EDO it&apos;s meantone. Once it&apos;s flat of 19-EDO it becomes<br/>flattone, and once it gets flat of 7-EDO it&apos;s mavila. Once it goes<br/>south of 16-EDO we&apos;re firmly into pelogic territory. But this is just<br/>my intuition built up from years of studying these maps of optimal<br/>tuning ranges; is there a systematic way of working this out for<br/>arbitrary temperaments?</p><p>&gt; A compromise between these two descriptive viewpoints: how about a set<br/>&gt; of sample tunings for each temperament class, including the POTE and<br/>&gt; TOP, and also some others showing a variety of &quot;styles&apos; -- not to stop<br/>&gt; people from doing something a bit different, but to give an idea of<br/>&gt; the usual ranges of variation even while leaving the class itself<br/>&gt; abstract, and not subject to any limits.</p><p>I agree that this is a good idea and any in-depth discussion of a<br/>temperament should definitely do this. I do have a bit to say on the<br/>different tunings for mavila and porcupine, two temperaments which I&apos;m<br/>fairly familiar with, just like we all have a bit to say on the<br/>different tunings for meantone. The only reason that POTE is what&apos;s<br/>listed on the wiki is that it can be easily computed and printed out<br/>for any arbitrary temperament, whereas it probably takes some<br/>experimentation from a real live human being to be able to write a bit<br/>about the musical possibilities afforded by variations in tuning. The<br/>Facebook Xenharmonic Alliance group has seen a good amount of in-depth<br/>discussion like this, with a good amount of conversation about<br/>different mavila tunings and such. I even did these retunings of<br/>pieces of common music to different parts of the mavila spectrum:</p><p>9-EDO <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-9-edo/">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-9-edo/</a><br/>25-EDO <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-25-edo/">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-25-edo/</a><br/>16-EDO <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-16-edo/">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-16-edo/</a><br/>23-EDO <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-23-edo/">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/sets/the-mavila-experiments-23-edo/</a></p><p>My impression is that 25-EDO version was melodically &quot;clearer&quot; in a<br/>way in terms of establishing new perceptual interval categories that<br/>are &quot;stable&quot; and don&apos;t run over and interfere with one another - but<br/>the tradeoff is that the intonation for 25-EDO is really bad. In<br/>contrast, 23-EDO has better intonation, but it&apos;s sometimes hard for me<br/>to tell between the interval of a ~522 cent fourth and that of three<br/>stacked ~158 cent whole steps. 16-EDO is a nice tradeoff between the<br/>two. I note the &quot;clearness&quot; of 25-EDO comes out most when I play it a<br/>certain way myself though; in these particular examples I think I<br/>found 16-EDO clearest.</p><p>&gt; Yes, a bit like pelog fifths. My experience is that a bit of<br/>&gt; timbre manipulation can make these sound quite &quot;3/2-ish&quot; --<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t tried this with Mavila, but with 23-EDO, for example.<br/>&gt; And 11-EDO seems to be right on the edge of possibility, at least<br/>&gt; with my crude timbral techniques.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/RhapsodyForDanStearns1.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/RhapsodyForDanStearns1.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Right, exactly! There&apos;s a whole Hornbostel/armodue/mavila/pelog<br/>spectrum just like there&apos;s a flattone/meantone/superpyth/etc spectrum.</p><p>&gt; The best policy! I&apos;m familiar with this debate about fifths around 675<br/>&gt; cents, for example in relation to 16-EDO, where claims were sometimes<br/>&gt; heard that Easley Blackwood was &quot;wrong&quot; about 675 cents being a<br/>&gt; recognizable fifth. My own experience with 23-EDO tells me he was<br/>&gt; right -- but a theory of temperament might want wisely to let people<br/>&gt; agree on a framework and carry on the debates from there.</p><p>If there&apos;s one thing that I hope to convey in this conversation, it&apos;s<br/>that I think the question of what&apos;s a &quot;recognizable fifth&quot; is a really<br/>deep, meaningful question that touches on some of the farthest and<br/>most complex areas of music cognition yet imagined. What it is that<br/>constitutes an interval&apos;s recognizable &quot;identity,&quot; and does so in a<br/>way that multiple ratios can fit into it, is a pretty deep and<br/>possibly subjective question. My goal is to develop an approach for<br/>establishing new &quot;stable&quot; sets of interval identities, whatever they<br/>might be, because I have a hunch that this is where the real jackpot<br/>is to be found in the &quot;xenharmonic&quot; ideal - though I&apos;m still not sure<br/>what the rules of such perceptual stability are.</p><p>So this is why I&apos;m sometimes hesitant to further enshrine 12-EDO based<br/>categories into any theory and why I&apos;m so much more enamored with<br/>scale structure than ratios for the moment; I need to find a nice<br/>informational framework to establish a raw structure for music so that<br/>my puny human brain can figure out what&apos;s going on when I hear things.<br/>Or well, I need to find one other than 12-EDO, anyway.</p><p>&gt; The answer is that most of the time, I&apos;m simply naming a specific<br/>&gt; scale, or maybe better gamut, the kind that a Scala file defines:<br/>&gt; Peppermint (2/1 and 704.096-cent fifth courtesy of Kennan Pepper), O3,<br/>&gt; MET-24, etc.</p><p>OK, I see. So if MET-24 is a scale, is MET itself a temperament (with<br/>a specific tuning)?</p><p>Do these three scales correspond to the same mapping, or do they have<br/>different mappings? Maybe we could abstract them to Peppermint, O3,<br/>and MET temperament classes.</p><p>&gt; And understand, under the old paradigm that I grew up with, so to<br/>&gt; speak, we wouldn&apos;t even ask the question, &quot;What are you describing, a<br/>&gt; tuning or a mapping or an abstract temperament.&quot; Back then, a tuning<br/>&gt; was pretty much a tuning, and the presumption was that you were<br/>&gt; describing something definable in a Scala file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, in retrospect, _mappings_ were often the essence of what was<br/>&gt; going on.</p><p>Right, so I&apos;m coming into this much later; I&apos;m just happy to see if I<br/>can connect the dots between various preexisting ideas a little bit. I<br/>think we&apos;re converging now.</p><p>&gt; For example, my e-based temperament in 2000 -- &quot;temperament&quot; meaning<br/>&gt; at that time simply a tuning system (2/1, 704.607 cents) -- had<br/>&gt; mappings which included four 5ths up as a regular major third at 14/11<br/>&gt; (896/891); and 15 fifths up as a 7/4 minor seventh (14680064/14348907).<br/>&gt; The last mapping didn&apos;t seem much on the radar screens at the time:<br/>&gt; people might recommend 1/4-comma or Kornerup or whatever for 7, or<br/>&gt; else 22-EDO or the like. &quot;Temper the fifths at around 704.5-705.0<br/>&gt; cents, and use 15 fifths up as 7/4,&quot; wasn&apos;t such a familiar idea, as<br/>&gt; far as I could see at the time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But&apos;s let&apos;s consider that 14/11 mapping.</p><p>OK, so for <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a>, this works out to be this as of yet unnamed temperament:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=2.3.7.11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=2.3.7.11</a></p><p>What should this be named, E-base temperament? Euler temperament?<br/>(Looks like below you call it &quot;gentle&quot; temperament?)</p><p>So then we can organize this into a temperament family by seeing what<br/>extensions there are on larger subgroups, in this case 2.3.5.7.11. You<br/>can also say, if you want, that 5/1 is 21 fifths, giving you Leapday<br/>temperament as an extension:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=11</a>. Or, you can say<br/>that 5/1 is 8 fourths, making this an extension of schismatic<br/>temperament, which also has no name (what should it be named?):<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46c&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46c&limit=11</a>. So these are both<br/>extensions of the E-base temperament family.</p><p>&gt; Now the textbooks and articles on &quot;multiple divisions&quot; (EDO&apos;s in<br/>&gt; today&apos;s parlsance) would address 46-EDO from a 2-3-5 perspective, but<br/>&gt; just try to find even a brief mention in that literature, &quot;One notable<br/>&gt; property of the 46-tone division is that 14/11 is virtually just.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, in retrospect, it&apos;s a new mapping. And this can make a difference<br/>&gt; for newbies and others.</p><p>Do you mean that the literature at the time never thought to venture<br/>beyond the 5-limit for something like 46-EDO?</p><p>&gt; If a &quot;major third&quot; always means the best approximation of 5/4 in a<br/>&gt; given system, then 46-EDO is &quot;hard&quot; for a newbie because of the<br/>&gt; complex mapping; but, assuming the newbie is used to a major third at<br/>&gt; around the range of 5/4-400 cents, say, finding a congenial style is<br/>&gt; &quot;easy&quot; once the mapping becomes familiar (and maybe some comma pumps<br/>&gt; are finessed or deliberately exploited).</p><p>Do you mean the mapping of 14/11 to four fifths?</p><p>&gt; If a &quot;major third&quot; in 46-EDO Gentle maps to 14/11, then the &quot;newbie&quot;<br/>&gt; will find it easy to navigate the system -- no different than in<br/>&gt; meantone, just a different major third and comma. However, to use RMP<br/>&gt; terminology -- and this is my turn to practice being descriptive<br/>&gt; rather than prescriptive -- someone wanting to play meantone-like<br/>&gt; music premised on a major third of 5/4-400 cents may find this mapping<br/>&gt; rather high in its level of error, let us say.</p><p>Sure, or they could alter their concept of major third to not always<br/>be 5/4, the same as in 22-EDO. For instance, in 22-EDO, I don&apos;t expect<br/>the sorts of major chords that are easily reachable by the circle of<br/>fifths to be really concordant (because they&apos;re supermajor chords).<br/>But I do expect that 22-EDO circle of fifth &quot;major thirds&quot; fit nicely<br/>into 4:7:9 chords.</p><p>&gt; And then the question might be one of either manipulating timbre to<br/>&gt; &quot;tame&quot; those wide major thirds (as Ivor Darreg did with an instrument<br/>&gt; for 17-EDO), or looking into a different musical style where active<br/>&gt; thirds will fit just fine -- e.g. Machaut rather than Palestrina or<br/>&gt; even Bach.</p><p>There&apos;s also something like 32-EDO, where the &quot;major chords&quot; become<br/>10:13:15. 10:13:15 isn&apos;t much more complex than 10:12:15, and I<br/>actually find it to be a bit relaxing - in a certain way they&apos;re less<br/>harsh than 17-EDO or 22-EDO&apos;s &quot;major&quot; chords.</p><p>&gt; But from an RMP perspective, I guess, we just name the possible<br/>&gt; mappings and commas, and let people decide what fits. And, of course,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s possible to have guides that give the abstract temperament and<br/>&gt; then comments about experiences that different people have had.</p><p>Well, in all fairness, people don&apos;t usually say that 46-EDO supports<br/>meantone temperament, so it&apos;s all worked out so far :)</p><p>&gt; Here I&apos;m addressing your question of what I&apos;ve generally meant by<br/>&gt; these terms, not what the usage could or should be. And traditionally,<br/>&gt; we might speak of &quot;meantone temperament&quot; generally -- but maybe most<br/>&gt; naturally as referring to the process of designing or tuning a<br/>&gt; meantone, with &quot;meantone temperaments&quot; as the actual tunings.<br/>&gt; At least, that&apos;s my first impression of the old-style usage.</p><p>Well, as long as we&apos;re all on the same page now about temperaments,<br/>temperament classes, families, etc., I&apos;m happy :)</p><p>But when people talk about &quot;meantone temperament&quot; in the literature,<br/>they do mean the more abstract temperament class, right? Not just<br/>specifically 1/4-comma meantone or something?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105278 href="#105278">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2012 8:35:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Do these three scales correspond to the same mapping, or do they have<br/>&gt; different mappings?

By the way, one issue with a truly &quot;culturally impartial&quot;<br/>mapping system is either flexibly categorizing intervals based on<br/>ratios or cents (as I often tend to do) or by primes -- even &quot;abstract<br/>primes&quot; -- can be difficult to avoid. And you are right to make it an<br/>explicit concern!</p><p>&gt; OK, so for <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a>, this works out to be this as of yet unnamed<br/>&gt; temperament:<br/>&gt; [50]<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=2.3.7.11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=2.3.7.11</a> What<br/>&gt; should this be named, E-base temperament? Euler temperament?  (Looks<br/>&gt; like below you call it &quot;gentle&quot; temperament?)</p><p>Please let me go through this, if I can, both concisely and step by<br/>step. First, here&apos;s a bit of documentation of what I think could very<br/>appropriately be called Euler -- the abstract temperament or class, of<br/>which the e-based tuning (2000) is one example, 63-EDO another, your<br/>nearby POTE yet another, and 80-EDO still another at about the top of<br/>the range.</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/14361">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/14361</a>&gt;<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/20573">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/20573</a>&gt;<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/23881">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/23881</a>&gt;<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/24488">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/24488</a>&gt;<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/18098">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/18098</a>&gt;</p><p>The key here is a rank-2 path to 7 through 13-14-15 generators.<br/>Taking what I understand to be an RMP worldview, I&apos;d say that Gentle<br/>is a temperament class or possibly superclass or whatever with two<br/>main members: Parapyth using a rank-3 mapping for 2.3.7.11.13; and<br/>Euler using a rank-2 mapping.</p><p>Gentle class tempers out 896:891, 352:351, 364:363, and 10648:10647.<br/>In either Parapyth or Euler, the two subclasses or whatever, taking<br/>3/2 as the linear generator, 4 generators map to 14/11, and -3<br/>generators to 13/11. Gentle class also tempers out 28672/28431,<br/>so that 7-8-9-10 generators produce intervals at or near ratios<br/>such as 14/13-21/13-63/52-189/104. This makes it possible to obtain<br/>some neutral intervals within a single 12-note chain which are<br/>supplemented by others from the spacing generator in Parapyth rank-3,<br/>but serves as the main pathway in rank-2 Euler. Thus we have at<br/>least as many neutral intervals in Gentle (Parapyth or Euler) as<br/>we have schismatic intervals in a Pythagorean tuning of the same<br/>size, or 7-based intervals in a meantone tuning around 1/4-comma<br/>or 31-EDO.</p><p>Parapyth rank-3 typically ranges from around 29-EDO to 702.2 cents<br/>say. By a pure 14/11 tuning (704.377 cents) or the almost identical<br/>46-EDO, the rank-2 Euler strategy starts to get us close to 7/6 and<br/>7/4, while we get a third from -13 generators at 443 cents or around<br/>128/99, a really intriguing ratio.</p><p>In Parapyth, the spacing generator acts as the 28/27 step, among other<br/>things. In Euler, the 12-note diesis is large enough to serve this<br/>purpose -- as a quite narrow step around 33/32 around 46-EDO or a pure<br/>14/11 tuning, but as a &quot;natural spacing&quot; very similar to Parapyth in<br/>the main Euler range of around 704.6-705.0 cents.</p><p>Gentle class refers to an undecimal/tredecimal eventone with 14/11 and<br/>13/11 as the common theme.</p><p>The term &quot;ChristmasEve&quot; might be used, not so much as the name of a<br/>class, as an informal term for the area around 704.377 cents (or<br/>46-EDO) used in a generally 2.3.7.11.13 manner, in contrast to the<br/>13-limit Leapday.</p><p>So we have, in outline form:</p><p>  I. Gentle class: 14/11, 13/11 from 4 and -3 generators<br/>     Commas tempered out: 896/891, 352/351, 364/363, 10648/10647,<br/>     28672/28431 (the last is important!)<br/>     Primes 2.3.7.11.13</p><p>     A. Parapyth, mostly rank-3 (say 29-EDO to 704.2 cents)<br/>        These observe 169/168<br/>        (14/13, 7 generators; 13/12, -5 generators + spacing)<br/>        1. Peppermint (2/1, 704.096, 58.680)<br/>        2. O3 (2/1, 703.893, 57.148)<br/>        3. MET-24 (2/1, 703.711, 57.422)<br/>        4. POTE (2/1, 703.856, 58.339)</p><p>     B. Euler, rank-2 (optimal range at 704.5-705.0 cents)<br/>        These temper out 169/168 (7 generators best 14/13, 13/12)<br/>        1. e-based tuning (2/1, 704.607)<br/>        2. POTE (2/1, 704.753)<br/>        3. Minimax with 7/6 eigenmonzo (2/1, 704.776)<br/>        4. 9/7 eigenmonzo (2/1, 704.994)</p><p>Tempering out the 28672/28431 to get neutral rather than 5-limit<br/>schismatic thirds is rather like tempering out the 81/80 in<br/>meantone to get 5/4 rather than 81/64: the idea of tempering is<br/>to get something a bit different than we would with pure fifths.</p><p>In fact, meantone and what is now called Gentle have curious<br/>parallels. With meantone, the idea was to take Pythagorean<br/>schismatic thirds and make them the regular thirds from 4 or -3<br/>generators, so that as many thirds as possible would be smooth.</p><p>With Gentle, the idea is to have -8 and +9 generators produce<br/>intriguing and rather complex thirds, different from 14/11 and<br/>13/11 at +4 and -3 generators, but congenial in having an active<br/>and forward-going quality, for example in medieval European<br/>cadences. Here are two posts, the second addressing this point,<br/>from the year 2000, with the curious terminology showing how this<br/>part of the spectrum was sort of up for grabs. The discussion of<br/>&quot;alternative thirds&quot; is in the second part:</p><p> &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11096">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11096</a>&gt;<br/> &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11108">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11108</a>&gt;</p><p>And I&apos;d just add for now that while the literature on 46-EDO did<br/>sometimes discuss higher primes, the regular and near-pure 14/11<br/>was rarely mentioned as any kind of asset: the idea that someone<br/>might use a 4-generator mapping for the major third wasn&apos;t<br/>considered. George Secor, in tuning the 8 more remote fifths<br/>of his 17-WT (1978) at 704.377 cents for some pure 14/11 thirds,<br/>was really setting a landmark -- and with a wonderful and peerless<br/>example of this form of well-temperament.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105285 href="#105285">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2012 2:50:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>  &gt;&gt; O3 and MET are apparently both scales/tunings of<br/>  &gt;&gt; parapyth.

The<br/>nice thing about this particular region is that it&apos;s possible to do<br/>minimax on 2-3-7-9 (7/6 pure), and at the same time get really nice<br/>results on 13/8, for example.</p><p>However, the POTE seems to be right around the middle of the range, or<br/>1/5-kleisma (i.e. 896/891), or just 22/21. And MET-24 seems to go a<br/>bit easier on the fifths, which is why it&apos;s called &quot;Milder Extended<br/>Temperament&quot; -- milder than Peppermint or O3, that is.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105290 href="#105290">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2012 6:20:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI, Mike.</p><p>&gt;&gt; First, thank you so much for your comments here -- and I hope that you<br/>&gt;&gt; and your family are OK!</p><p>&gt; Yep, much better than expected! Philly was mostly spared the wrath<br/>&gt; of Sandy.</p><p>This is good news to hear!</p><p>&gt;  Right, exactly. It&apos;s probably better described as 1/5-comma<br/>&gt;  superpyth or something, but you could call it -1/4-comma meantone<br/>&gt;  if you want.</p><p>Agreed. By the way, one issue with a truly &quot;culturally impartial&quot;<br/>mapping system is that either flexibly categorizing intervals based on<br/>ratios or cents (as I often tend to do) or by primes -- even &quot;abstract<br/>primes&quot; -- can be difficult to do without some viewpoint, with one<br/>person&apos;s viewpoint often being another&apos;s &quot;detected bias.&quot; And you are<br/>right to make it an explicit concern!</p><p>&gt;  So one thing is that RMP is agnostic on interval categories like<br/>&gt;  &quot;major third&quot;; the only thing it&apos;s mapping is ratios.</p><p>Here we may be running into a paradox: for the RMP or my &quot;Neoclassical<br/>Mapping Paradigm&quot; as I might call it, not to mention lots of other<br/>approaches, biases may not be so easy to avoid.</p><p>For example, 29-EDO has something very close to 10:13:15 (as you<br/>mention below for 32-EDO also). Viewing 248 cents as a quite<br/>inaccurate 8/7 or 7/6 might be less conducive to the spirit of the<br/>tuning than viewing it as 15/13, or maybe just 248 cents, or as a<br/>&quot;hemifourth&quot; (which it is, literally, in this system).  And &quot;I want an<br/>appropriate or exact hemifourth&quot; is a lot more congenial mapping<br/>concept here than &quot;I want an inaccurate representation of prime 7.&quot;</p><p>So the Neoclassical approach, if that&apos;s the term, has the strength<br/>that it&apos;s as easy to talk about seeking 15/13 or more generally a<br/>hemifourth as it is to talk about seeking 7, but the disadvantage that<br/>it does involve some interval category concepts, even if open to<br/>revision to fit this or that cultural scheme.</p><p>The RMP, in contrast, by using primes, may imply certain expectations<br/>simply by the choice of primes. And I suspect that there may be a<br/>certain Partchian worldview involved at some level, Partch being a<br/>great musician and theorist, but definitely one not afraid to make<br/>value judgments about what was or was not an apt tuning!</p><p>For example, consider what I might term a Partchian Anomalous<br/>Saturated Suspension (PASS), more specifically 12:14:18:21.<br/>Evidently Paul Erlich and Graham and whoever else developed this PASS<br/>concept noted the interesting fact that this routine <a href="http://2.3.7.9">2.3.7.9</a> sonority<br/>doesn&apos;t contain 5, and yet can&apos;t have 5 added while having each<br/>interval stay within the 9-odd limit (7:4, 3:2, 3:2, 7:6, 9:7, 7:6).</p><p>Mathematically interesting, but not so &quot;anomalous&quot; if one takes<br/><a href="http://2.3.7.9">2.3.7.9</a> or 2.3.7.9.11.13 for granted, where it could be a close<br/>analogous of a dominant seventh chord in major/minor harmony.  So PASS<br/>could simply be a recognition of a curious quirk of 12:14:18:21 from a<br/>certain Partchian perspective, or in Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic harmony;<br/>but the &quot;anomalous&quot; part can sound a bit curious when used frequently<br/>as a term for something which is totally an everyday reality from a<br/><a href="http://2.3.7.9">2.3.7.9</a> perspective -- maybe a &quot;subgroup subculture&quot; like mine &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>The PASS name makes it clear that the &quot;anomaly&quot; is in the eyes of a<br/>Partchian perspective, making the term both amusing and edifying from<br/>anyone&apos;s viewpoint, I think.</p><p>And some of the RMP and xenwiki terminology, I should emphasize, is<br/>wonderful, like &quot;Swiss tetrad&quot; for 12:14:18:21. This is one of my<br/>favorite sonorities for a cadence, which I now call a Bernese cadence,<br/>where the outer 7/4 contracts by stepwise contrary motion to a 3/2,<br/>and the 7/6 thirds to unisons, while the middle 9/7 third expands to a<br/>fifth. Bernese cadences are tricolor: they may be intensive (ascending<br/>28/27 semitones or thirdtones), remissive (descending 28/27 steps), or<br/>equable (steps close to 14/13 and 13/12 in Parapyth, or equal and<br/>around 132-135 cents in Euler, where 169:168 is tempered out).</p><p>But &quot;Swiss tetrad&quot; and &quot;Bernese cadence&quot; have now become part of my<br/>standard vocabulary. Although it might have been intoned closer to<br/>Pythagorean than to septimal, there&apos;s actually an example of the<br/>progression I&apos;m describing near the end of the first section of<br/>Perotin&apos;s _Sederunt Principes_. A melodic phrase gets repeated twice,<br/>the second time with strong cadence where the sonority E-G-B-D<br/>resolves to the fifth F-C: that&apos;s the Bernese cadence, apart from the<br/>question of septimal intonation. The melodic phrase in the audible<br/>upper melodic line is C-D-E-F D-E-C-B D-D C. (Some performers might<br/>have used a Bb inflection giving us the more tense tritonic sonority<br/>E-G-Bb-D resolving to F-C, as distinct from the Bernese form.)</p><p>That maybe illustrates another possible difference in viewpoints when<br/>people discuss tunings. The RMP is often out to do really<br/>groundbreaking things: every other new tuning might be a new &quot;abstract<br/>temperament&quot; or whatever. In contrast, I&apos;m exploring intonational<br/>nuances and variations for a cadence 800 years old. In fact, a 12-MOS<br/>of MET-24 is meant to temper as little as possible while meeting other<br/>goals of the system (e.g. 14/13 within three cents of just), so that<br/>the fifths and fourths aren&apos;t too far from the ideal of medieval<br/>Pythagorean tuning. From that perspective, it&apos;s more Neoclassical than<br/>radical.</p><p>&gt; What counts as a major third, for instance? Is 13/10 a major third<br/>&gt; or a perfect fourth?  Is 16/13 a major third? Is major thirdness an<br/>&gt; inherently perceptual thing or a culturally learned thing? From<br/>&gt; RMP&apos;s perspective, there&apos;s nothing special that inherently groups<br/>&gt; 5/4, 9/7, and 14/11 together (or 7/6 and 6/5 together, or 8/7 and<br/>&gt; 9/8 and 10/9 together, etc). In fact, there are temperaments that<br/>&gt; perceptually group 7/6 and 8/7 together, and ones which distinguish<br/>&gt; abruptly between 7/6 and 6/5 .</p><p>The question about 16/13 is an excellent one; my own perception is<br/>that 16/13 defines about the top of the &quot;central neutral range,&quot; with<br/>21/17 or 26/21 as a large neutral or &quot;submajor&quot; third, which could be<br/>described as a special kind of &quot;majorness&quot; different from that of 5/4,<br/>14/11, or 9/7. Even around 16/13, the fact that some Arab theorists<br/>have spoken of Rast as &quot;the Arab major scale&quot; suggests that you have a<br/>point! But I wouldn&apos;t put it under the heading of prime 5, any more<br/>than I would call it 14/11 or 9/7, for example. And that&apos;s where<br/>mapping notation can make a difference.</p><p>The grouping together of 7/6 and 8/7 is very important in<br/>understanding a Near Eastern modality such as Hijaz as practiced by<br/>some Turkish musicians, or likewise Persian Esfahan: there&apos;s a large<br/>middle step in the tetrachord, 8/7-ish for some and 7/6-ish for<br/>others, with myriad gradations and hemifourth interpretations right<br/>around 250 cents or so as well. The Arab symbol of 5 quartertones, if<br/>taken as Amine Beyhom does to mean 230-270 cents or so, really does<br/>express the category quite well.</p><p>A humorous story is that one excellent writer on 13th-century Near<br/>Eastern theory noted that some sources said a mode called Buzurg<br/>(somewhat analogous in its lower tetrachord to modern Persian Esfahan)<br/>was in this tetrachord 14:13-8:7-13:12, while another gave<br/>12:11-7:6-22:21. This author thought that the first version might be<br/>just a different notation for the second tuning, used by a theorist<br/>who didn&apos;t favor a 7:6 chromatic step as part of his modal theory!</p><p>But measurements of modern Turkish Hijaz or Persian Esfahan suggest<br/>that both theorists may have been right: &quot;somewhere between around 225<br/>and 275 cents&quot; or whatever may have been the practice then, as now.</p><p>Your point about 6/5 and 7/6 as not necessarily equivalent is also a<br/>good one! Some books on historical European temperaments assert that<br/>it is impossible for a minor third to become a &quot;wolf&quot; -- in a meantone<br/>system or well-temperament, it will always be acceptably close to<br/>either 6/5 or 7/6.</p><p>But in the 16th century, even someone as radical as Vicentino with his<br/>taste for neutral thirds around 11/9 (his estimate of the approximate<br/>size of this irrational meantone interval) found &quot;minimal thirds,&quot;<br/>probably close to 7/6, rather leaning to dissonance, and to be used<br/>sparingly. Praetorius called them &quot;wolves.&quot; As a lover of 7/6, I need<br/>to keep in mind that the enthusiasm of Huygens was not a universal<br/>view in the 16th-17th centuries!</p><p>&gt;  I wouldn&apos;t mind calling temperaments where the optimal tuning<br/>&gt;  yields an LLsLLLs MOS &quot;eventone.&quot; But my question is, how does this<br/>&gt;  sort of classification/family scheme tie over to other temperaments<br/>&gt;  where the generator might not even be 3/2, for instance?</p><p>Good question, and that&apos;s an area where Graham&apos;s ideas and those  of<br/>others involved in the RMP could be really helpful.</p><p>&gt; Many of the more interesting temperaments aren&apos;t generated by 3/2,<br/>&gt; such as porcupine, for instance. Others, such as hedgehog in 22-EDO<br/>&gt; (the scale is 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3) so abruptly distinguish 7/6 and 6/5<br/>&gt; that they don&apos;t perceptually seem to aggregate into the same<br/>&gt; interval class at all, and yet 11/9 and 6/5 now sound like<br/>&gt; intonational variants of the same thing. How do we organize these<br/>&gt; types of temperaments into families?</p><p>It might be difficult.</p><p>&gt;  Right so, are MET-24, O3, and Peppermint the names of specific<br/>&gt;  scales?  Or specific mappings? Also, is a tuning specified?</p><p>Since this was the main question I addressed in my first reply last<br/>night, which in a nutshell confirms that these are all simply tunings,<br/>what I&apos;d like to do here is look at why this kind of question would be<br/>very natural to ask from an RMP perspective, and rather surprising<br/>from a Neoclassical perspective like mine where it would go without<br/>saying that they are tunings unless I call them &quot;tuning families&quot; or<br/>&quot;tuning styles&quot; or the like.</p><p>From Graham&apos;s writings and the RMP literature generally, I sense you<br/>are in what Thomas Kuhn might call the musical equivalent of a<br/>scientific revolution, as the term &quot;paradigm&quot; implies. In such a<br/>revolutionary situation, any new tuning (or &quot;temperament,&quot; as we would<br/>often call it, e.g. 2/7-comma meantone, or Kornerup, etc.) might also<br/>represent a &quot;new temperament&quot; in your sense of a new mapping scheme.<br/>Your literature lists scores or even hundreds of these, and you aspire<br/>to find many more.</p><p>For me, it&apos;s mostly Kuhn&apos;s normal science in &quot;the 704-cent<br/>neighborhood,&quot; now known as Gentle (i.e. Parapyth and Euler). The<br/>territory is familiar, indeed my everyday habitation as it has been<br/>for over a decade (apart from some diversions with modified meantone<br/>circles, another story), so it&apos;s mostly fine-tuning and exploring<br/>variations on medieval European polyphony or maqam music, etc.</p><p>True, I did have a mildly revolutionary period, around 2000-2002. That<br/>was like a brief Kuhnian revolution -- and then back to normal<br/>science! The revolution basically had two parts.</p><p>The first part, with medieval European Pythagorean intonation as my<br/>starting point as an ardent medievalist, happened in 2000: the e-based<br/>tuning (2/1, 704.607), with regular thirds near 14/11 and 13/11 (not<br/>so radically different from 81/64 and 32/27), and 15 fifths up as 7/4.</p><p>Actually, the most &quot;revolutionary&quot; part of the e-based tuning (and<br/>various others in that region) wasn&apos;t so much the relatively subtle<br/>shift in the color of regular thirds to 2.3.7.11.13 rather than<br/>Pythagorean ratios, but what happens at -8 and 9 generators! Rather<br/>than schismatic 5-limit thirds, we have neutral ones, or more<br/>specifically large and small neutral or submajor/supraminor, &quot;reverse<br/>Pythagorean thirds&quot; as I termed them, because like 14/11 and 13/11<br/>they are rather complex and active. The system thus had a kind of<br/>consistent ethos, with both the regular and &quot;alternative&quot; thirds<br/>nicely supporting medieval European cadences from _imperfectly_<br/>concordant and somewhat tense sonorities involving thirds and/or<br/>sixths to stable intervals like fifths or ideally a complete 2:3:4.</p><p>Now from my perspective, the idea of announcing an &quot;abstract<br/>temperament&quot; and then deciding on one more tunings for it seems very<br/>curious: for me, the tuning, e.g. e-based, comes first, and then maybe<br/>at some point a realization that this might be different enough that<br/>it could define a new genre or family. I tend often to proceed by<br/>pragmatic induction, starting with tunings and looking for larger<br/>patterns from there.</p><p>Getting back to the &quot;velvet revolution&quot; I experienced in 2000-2002,<br/>the e-based tuning in 24 notes (with 13-14-15 generators for<br/>9/7-7/6-7/4) had a feature that, in a sense, led naturally to the<br/>second phase of the revolution.</p><p>Mapped to my 24-note arrangement with two 12-note MIDI keyboards,<br/>e-based had the feel of (2/1, 704.607, 55.283). Only the first two<br/>generators are independent, the third being defined as the 12-note<br/>diesis, but it looked and felt and sounded like a spacing parameter.<br/>And the &quot;natural&quot; spacing served as 28/27, among other things.</p><p>In an article in the early 2001 on the e-based tuning, I noted that it<br/>was possible, for example, to place two 12-note chains of 17-EDO at<br/>the arbitrary distance of 55.106 cents to obtain pure 7/6 thirds.  In<br/>fact, it&apos;s in the last footnote to the first post (March 30, 2001) in<br/>this series on the e-based tuning:</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/20573">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/20573</a>&gt;<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/23881">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/23881</a>&gt;<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/24488">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/24488</a>&gt;</p><p>But my learning of George Secor&apos;s 17-tone well-temperament during the<br/>summer of 2001, and our actual contact near the end of that summer,<br/>was the catalytic ingredient for the second step, with George&apos;s 29-HTT<br/>as a model and &quot;how-to.&quot; More specifically, the 2.3.7.11.13 subset of<br/>his tuning had a rank-3 structure of (2/1, 703.579, 58.090).</p><p>In addition to learning of that model for what I would soon do, I also<br/>learned with his mentoring and through our collaboration about things<br/>like the equable divisions, we called them, of 12:13:14 or 11:12:13<br/>(harmonic, as here, or arithmetic) -- as well as the wonderful world<br/>of Near Eastern music.</p><p>So it was a revolution, but not a disorienting one: a rich neomedieval<br/>outlook became yet richer by taking into account Near Eastern as well<br/>as medieval European musics! No paradigm was broken: but my universe<br/>indeed expanded.</p><p>And this led by June of 2002 to Peppermint: simply taking a 12-note<br/>chain of Pepper/Wilson (2/1, 704.096), and tuning a second identical<br/>chain at what we now call a spacing parameter of 58.680 cents for a<br/>pure 7/6 and a virtually just 12:13:14 division.</p><p>At that point, the deed had been done. I thought of Peppermint, a very<br/>specific tuning (to me, temperament usually means the same thing), as<br/>maybe representing a new genre of neomedieval tuning because of the<br/>high accuracy for 2.3.7.11.13 -- with George Secor&apos;s influence leading<br/>me often to think in terms of these ratios.</p><p>So Peppermint, the second stage and completion of the &quot;revolution,&quot;<br/>involved the elements of the 704-cent neighborhood, ratios of<br/>2.3.7.11.13 with my own idiomatic focus on superparticular neutral<br/>seconds used in divisions of a 7/6 or 13/11 minor third (e.g. 14:13:12<br/>or 13:12:11); and a focus on Near Eastern as well as medieval European<br/>music.</p><p>In fact, the division of the fourth 33:36:39:42:44 expresses to me<br/>much of the essence of Peppermint and later related tunings like O3<br/>and MET-24; and in Secorian style, one could also look at the hexad<br/>4:6:7:9:11:13.</p><p>Here&apos;s a post reporting this &quot;mini-revolution&quot; marked by Peppermint --<br/>again simply the name of the tuning.</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/38440">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning/message/38440</a>&gt;</p><p>From there on, it&apos;s mostly Kuhn&apos;s normal science, with O3 and MET-24<br/>simply as refinements, like yet another new and &quot;optimal&quot; shade of<br/>meantone!</p><p>A strange analogy: but our dialogue seems a bit like that between a<br/>group of researchers on the cutting edge of supercollider research in<br/>particle physics, and an 18th-century architect. The first is a<br/>pursuit leading to radical new discoveries, while the second involves<br/>applying and fine-tuning mostly familiar principles.</p><p>In fact, as far as I know, the term meantone emerged sometime around<br/>the 17th or 18th century: but in the late 15th and 16th centuries, it<br/>might be called simply _participatio_ or _systema participata_ (the<br/>latter term occurring in the 17th century, at any rate): basically, a<br/>system for &quot;sharing out&quot; commas, or more specifically the 81/80.</p><p>Likewise, with the e-based tuning or Peppermint and the like, I look<br/>at it as a style or ethos of temperament: &quot;the 704-cent neighborhood,&quot;<br/>or neomedieval tuning, or two 12-note chains at a tempered 28/27<br/>apart, etc. Left to myself, I probably wouldn&apos;t think of giving the<br/>genre a proper name.</p><p>However, since learning of what we now call the RMP project, I have<br/>wanted the e-based and Peppermint tunings, or more generally the<br/>styles of neomedieval tuning they represent, to be a part of the RMP<br/>catalogue. That it&apos;s happening now is very exciting, because it means<br/>a broader scope for your paradigm, and also an opportunity for people<br/>to learn about a fuller range of options.</p><p>&gt;  I wouldn&apos;t mind a taxonomy of the different tunings that a<br/>&gt;  temperament offers, though I&apos;m not sure how to classify them in a<br/>&gt;  way that applies to all of the strange and exotic temperament<br/>&gt;  classes that are out there.</p><p>Maybe these are two distinct but complementary projects, like theories<br/>of generative or universal grammar and descriptive studies of the<br/>details of a specific language. At this point Parapyth is close to<br/>being my mothertongue, as it were -- or more precisely, a tuning in<br/>which I can speak my compositional mothertongue, 13th-14th century<br/>European polyphony, easily and fluently (by my standards, not<br/>necessarily that high as musicianship goes!).</p><p>But it&apos;s like my settled literary language, with modified meantone<br/>(Zest-24) as a second language, while RMP people often seem to delight<br/>in writing each new novel or even short story in a different language!</p><p>&gt;  Right, I&apos;m familiar with this &quot;syntonic temperament&quot; name. That&apos;s a<br/>&gt;  good example of why I think it makes more sense to keep the naming<br/>&gt;  of mappings and tunings separate. And if you&apos;re going to name<br/>&gt;  tunings, don&apos;t name them after vanishing commas which imply<br/>&gt;  mappings!</p><p>We&apos;re agreed there!</p><p>&gt;  Right; I think that most people do this intuitively. In my head,<br/>&gt;  for instance, if the fifth gets sharp of 12-EDO it&apos;s superpyth, and<br/>&gt;  if it&apos;s flat of 12-EDO it&apos;s meantone. Once it&apos;s flat of 19-EDO it<br/>&gt;  becomes flattone, and once it gets flat of 7-EDO it&apos;s mavila. Once<br/>&gt;  it goes south of 16-EDO we&apos;re firmly into pelogic territory. But<br/>&gt;  this is just my intuition built up from years of studying these<br/>&gt;  maps of optimal tuning ranges; is there a systematic way of working<br/>&gt;  this out for arbitrary temperaments?</p><p>This kind of map of the spectrum -- not to be confused with an RMP<br/>mapping -- is something I can relate to! I love timelines and the<br/>like, sometimes associating street numbers with years or historical<br/>events.</p><p>&gt; I agree that this is a good idea and any in-depth discussion of a<br/>&gt; temperament should definitely do this. I do have a bit to say on the<br/>&gt; different tunings for mavila and porcupine, two temperaments which<br/>&gt; I&apos;m fairly familiar with, just like we all have a bit to say on the<br/>&gt; different tunings for meantone. The only reason that POTE is what&apos;s<br/>&gt; listed on the wiki is that it can be easily computed and printed out<br/>&gt; for any arbitrary temperament, whereas it probably takes some<br/>&gt; experimentation from a real live human being to be able to write a<br/>&gt; bit about the musical possibilities afforded by variations in<br/>&gt; tuning.</p><p>Certainly the POTE is useful as one example, and the Parapyth one is<br/>very helpful, a fine tuning of this class. In fact, the POTE adds to<br/>something like O3 (with an almost identical generator), because it<br/>shows how spacing can be done in different ways, with different<br/>intervals favored (e.g. 9/7 in the POTE, a really fine choice for<br/>2-3-7-9 generally).</p><p>With Mavila, by the way, your TOP or POTE at rank-2 is an interesting<br/>variation on the Wilson-Grady approach of using a regular temperament<br/>to approximate a much freer form of tuning -- much as Parapyth might<br/>very imperfectly approximate the irregular tunings favored for Persian<br/>tar or santur. It might be good to give Chopi tunings also that people<br/>have emulated.</p><p>&gt;  Right, exactly! There&apos;s a whole Hornbostel/armodue/mavila/pelog<br/>&gt;  spectrum just like there&apos;s a flattone/meantone/superpyth/etc<br/>&gt;  spectrum.</p><p>True! Hornbostel wrote some fascinating things about interval<br/>perception, and there&apos;s the playful quip about how people are still<br/>debating whether his hypothesis about the possible acoustical origins<br/>of these small fifths might be a bit overblown :). But he certainly<br/>focused on a vital facet of many musical traditions.</p><p>&gt;  OK, I see. So if MET-24 is a scale, is MET itself a temperament (with<br/>&gt;  a specific tuning)?</p><p>&gt;  Do these three scales correspond to the same mapping, or do they<br/>&gt;  have different mappings? Maybe we could abstract them to<br/>&gt;  Peppermint, O3, and MET temperament classes.</p><p>As has by now likely become clear, that would be a bit like different<br/>temperament classes for 1/4-comma meantone, Kornerup&apos;s Golden<br/>Meantone or the POTE, and 2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>A humorous way to put this is that you seem to be crediting me with a<br/>lot more originality than I deserve!</p><p>It&apos;s sort of like a biologist discovering three new species -- or<br/>possibly rediscovering them, since George Secor&apos;s 2.3.7.11.13 portion<br/>of 29-HTT pretty much provided a model for Peppermint -- and then<br/>being asked, &quot;Are those three new species or three new phyla?&quot;</p><p>&gt;  Right, so I&apos;m coming into this much later; I&apos;m just happy to see if<br/>&gt;  I can connect the dots between various preexisting ideas a little<br/>&gt;  bit. I think we&apos;re converging now.</p><p>Yes. And part of that convergence may be a realization that different<br/>terminologies may reflect different experiences and research programs,<br/>so to speak.</p><p>With RMP, a new tuning might well be a new abstract temperament as<br/>well. With a more traditional agenda -- and mine likely is -- a new<br/>tuning is likely to be mostly normal science, with the temperament of<br/>the fifth rising or falling like hemlines in fashion.</p><p>&gt; OK, so for <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a>, this works out to be this as of yet unnamed<br/>&gt; temperament:<br/>&gt; [50]<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=2.3.7.11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=2.3.7.11</a> What<br/>&gt; should this be named, E-base temperament? Euler temperament?  (Looks<br/>&gt; like below you call it &quot;gentle&quot; temperament?)</p><p>A quick recap of my first response last night would be that Euler<br/>class or subclass -- with Gentle as a larger class including both<br/>rank-2 Euler and rank-3 Parapyth -- is a very appropriate name.<br/>And e-based temperament is simply an Euler class tuning.</p><p>What I might just add here is that from a keyboardist&apos;s point of view<br/>-- or at least mine, with two 12-note MIDI keyboards rather than a<br/>generalized keyboard -- Euler and Parapyth have the same key<br/>mappings, with the e-based tuning, for example, the equivalent of<br/>(2/1, 704.607, 55.283). The difference is only that the spacing isn&apos;t<br/>an independent generator in Euler, but is defined by the 12-tone<br/>diesis.</p><p>So the keyboard map in Euler (e.g. e-based tuning, 2000) is the same<br/>as in Parapyth (e.g. Peppermint, 2002).</p><p>For 7/6, it&apos;s tone plus spacing (e.g. D-E*). For 11/8, it&apos;s fourth<br/>plus spacing (e.g. C-F*). And in either Euler or Parapyth, we can get<br/>a nice Rast with either B-C#-Eb-E on either keyboard, or C*-D*-E-F*.<br/>The difference is that in Euler, a rank-2 system with full<br/>transposibility within the range of the 24-note chain of fifths, these<br/>two forms of Rast are identical (e.g. 0-209-363-495 cents in e-based);<br/>in Parapyth, the first has a brighter neutral third than the second<br/>(e.g. 0-207-370-496 or 0-207-357-497 in MET-24).</p><p>So with Parapyth rank-3, we save almost a cent of tempering, and get<br/>more shadings of neutral intervals. But Euler has its own advantages,<br/>and not just for newbies or oldsters who might prefer a somewhat<br/>simpler and more fully transposible system, itself, of course, a<br/>legitimate consideration.</p><p>For example, Parapyth has more neutral shadings but also, in its<br/>24-note version, fewer locations for each shading. We don&apos;t quite have<br/>enough generators in a single chain for something as simple as a<br/>submajor flavor of Rast with standard steps for inflections: large<br/>neutral sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, and large neutral seventh,<br/>say 104/63, 22/13, 39/22, and 13/7 in MET-24. The problem is that to<br/>get both 22/13 and 104/63, we need mappings of 3 and -9 generators,<br/>but we only have 11 in a chain! So there are creative kludges like<br/>using 12/7 in place of 22/13, or a lower 13/8 in place of 104/63.</p><p>But in Euler, such kludges are unnecessary: a single 24-note chain is<br/>long enough to get a bright Rast without cutting corners.</p><p>&gt;  [51]<a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=29_46&limit=11</a>. Or, you can<br/>&gt;  say that 5/1 is 8 fourths, making this an extension of schismatic<br/>&gt;  temperament, which also has no name (what should it be named?):</p><p>Whatever I might say about this, odds are that someone will do it,<br/>because it&apos;s been done for the 353-cent third in 17-EDO, and that&apos;s 33<br/>cents from 5/4, or almost as far as you can get from either 5/4 or 6/5<br/>within the 25/24 region that separates them!</p><p>This isn&apos;t a new phenomenon, either: in 1555, Vicentino wrote about<br/>how people often confused a &quot;proximate minor third,&quot; his term for a<br/>third a meantone diesis larger than minor and associated with an<br/>approximate ratio of 11/9, with a major third, meaning the usual<br/>meantone version at 5/4. It&apos;s a point of view, and whoever wants to<br/>take it could design and name a system based on this view of Euler.</p><p>To share my own perspective, I&apos;ll repeat this link, pointing people to<br/>the discussion of &quot;alternative thirds&quot;:</p><p> &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_11108.html#11108">/tuning/topicId_11108.html#11108</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  So then we can organize this into a temperament family by seeing<br/>&gt;  what extensions there are on larger subgroups, in this case<br/>&gt;  2.3.5.7.11. You can also say, if you want, that 5/1 is 21 fifths,<br/>&gt;  giving you Leapday temperament as an extension:</p><p>Actually, in Euler, Leapday gives major thirds ranging from around<br/>1/8-comma meantone quality in e-based (396.745 cents) to an even 400<br/>cents in 63-EDO, very close to the <a href="http://2.3.7.9">2.3.7.9</a> minimax with a 7/6<br/>eigenmonzo or the slightly lower POTE; and 405 cents at 80-EDO or the<br/>top of the region (just 9/7). Just find thrice the size of the<br/>apotome, and you have the size of this third. The 5/4 eigenmonzo is at<br/>704.110 cents, so we&apos;re far beyond this point by the time we reach the<br/>Euler POTE.</p><p>But the really accurate strategy is -25 generators, with the &quot;double<br/>diesis&quot; for the e-based tuning (twice 55.283 cents, or 110.566 cents)<br/>serving as 16/15, and a third at 384.825 cents. In a 46-MOS, say, this<br/>could be a very effective strategy, and as a curiosity I should add<br/>that the e-based tuning will circulate in 109 notes. At the POTE, or<br/>(2/1, 704.753 cents) we have 381.175 cents, if I&apos;m correct, just a bit<br/>smaller than 7/22 octave.</p><p>&gt;  Do you mean that the literature at the time never thought to<br/>&gt;  venture beyond the 5-limit for something like 46-EDO?</p><p>What I mean, referring both to the traditional literature oriented<br/>around 2-3-5 and some discussions focusing on higher primes also, it<br/>seemed generally assumed that &quot;a major third&quot; would generally mean 5/4<br/>rather than 14/11, even in a system like 46-EDO where it was the<br/>virtually just regular third. And whether the ratio of 14/11 was an<br/>acoustically recognizable dyad, a wonderful emblematic ratio<br/>regardless of the answer to the first question, or whatever, was a<br/>question that did get some attention for time to time.</p><p>People can be enthusiastic about 4:5:6:7 or even 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 and<br/>not necessarily be attuned to medievalish polyphony, say, with 14/11<br/>and 13/11 as the regular, everyday thirds.</p><p>I may be overgeneralizing: but this was the way it seemed around the<br/>year 2000 -- before I knew of George Secor&apos;s 17-WT and 29-HTT which he<br/>had designed in 1978! And in a different direction, of course, the<br/>Miracle Tuning was also a rediscovery of the Secor tuning of 1975.</p><p>&gt;  Do you mean the mapping of 14/11 to four fifths?</p><p>What I meant is that if the mapping is to the approximate 5/4, then<br/>that couid be a bit complicated for a newbie, but would fit styles<br/>familiar to lots of people with a classical European background, say.<br/>The comma pumps are another issue, of course.</p><p>&gt;  Sure, or they could alter their concept of major third to not<br/>&gt;  always be 5/4, the same as in 22-EDO. For instance, in 22-EDO, I<br/>&gt;  don&apos;t expect the sorts of major chords that are easily reachable by<br/>&gt;  the circle of fifths to be really concordant (because they&apos;re<br/>&gt;  supermajor chords).  But I do expect that 22-EDO circle of fifth<br/>&gt;  &quot;major thirds&quot; fit nicely into 4:7:9 chords.</p><p>In a medieval setting, of course, this is easier, because anything<br/>more complex than 3/2 or 4/3 is unstable, and expected to have some<br/>degree of tension and striving to resolve. But I much agree that in<br/>22-EDO, 6:7:9, 4:6:7:9, 12:14:18:21, etc., are all options, for use in<br/>a medieval kind of polyphony or otherwise. And in 22-EDO, since the<br/>64/63 is tempered out, you get lots and lots of them!</p><p>In Euler and even more so in Parapyth, we observe the 64/63 and get<br/>higher accuracy -- but with the need for larger tuning sets to get a<br/>reasonable number. That&apos;s why a tuning size of 24 is so attractive, or<br/>2x12-MOS, even though 24 itself isn&apos;t a MOS like 17.</p><p>For 9/7-7/6-7/4-21/16 we need 13-14-15-16 generators, so 24 notes<br/>means we get eight locations for a tempered version of the 1-3-7-9<br/>hexany (1/1-9/8-7/6-21/16-7/4-2/1), and nine locations for the Swiss<br/>tetrad or 12:14:18:21. This is just about right, although 34 notes<br/>(2x17-MOS) would be yet richer with these septimal sonorities.</p><p>With 17, we&apos;ve just begun to get these wonderful intervals: so 24 is a<br/>good size.</p><p>&gt;  There&apos;s also something like 32-EDO, where the &quot;major chords&quot; become<br/>&gt;  10:13:15. 10:13:15 isn&apos;t much more complex than 10:12:15, and I<br/>&gt;  actually find it to be a bit relaxing - in a certain way they&apos;re<br/>&gt;  less harsh than 17-EDO or 22-EDO&apos;s &quot;major&quot; chords.</p><p>My experience with these is in 24-EDO and 29-EDO, for example, and I<br/>agree, with something like 26:30:39 quite suave and unique. Of course,<br/>I wouldn&apos;t really look for a &quot;major chord&quot; in the sense of a stable<br/>triad except in something like meantone context: I tend to avoid these<br/>terms in a medieval context, because they can suggest an expectation<br/>of restfulness and conclusiveness that just isn&apos;t there. But whatever<br/>one&apos;s point of view, the different alternatives and shadings are<br/>interesting.</p><p>&gt;  Well, in all fairness, people don&apos;t usually say that 46-EDO<br/>&gt;  supports meantone temperament, so it&apos;s all worked out so far :)</p><p>True enough :). I don&apos;t recall that ever being a controversy here, and<br/>there have been a fair number over the years.</p><p>&gt;  Well, as long as we&apos;re all on the same page now about temperaments,<br/>&gt;  temperament classes, families, etc., I&apos;m happy :)</p><p>Yes, I&apos;d say &quot;temperament class&quot; or &quot;abstract temperament&quot;<br/>disambiguates nicely on all sides. I guess my own approach might be to<br/>find a concrete temperament in the old sense, and let analysis or<br/>experience suggest where that specific tuning should fit in the larger<br/>scheme of things. But the very nature of the RMP project may lead you<br/>to more frequent instances of really new abstract temperaments -- not<br/>just new tunings and tweakings of established mappings.</p><p>&gt;  But when people talk about &quot;meantone temperament&quot; in the<br/>&gt;  literature, they do mean the more abstract temperament class,<br/>&gt;  right? Not just specifically 1/4-comma meantone or something?</p><p>Yes, except for some purists who will say: &quot;There&apos;s really only one<br/>meantone, and that&apos;s 1/4-comma, where the mean-tone is precisely the<br/>mean of 9/8 and 10/9.&quot; In my usage, we could speak of either &quot;meantone<br/>temperament&quot; as a general category, or &quot;meantone temperaments&quot; as<br/>specific instances of this category. So &quot;meantone temperament class&quot;<br/>fits nicely.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105294 href="#105294">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2012 12:37:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Gene.</p><p>&gt;  There&apos;s nothing in parapyth which requires you to use<br/>&gt;  period-generator-spacing, but you can certainly do it that way.</p><p>This raises a logical newbie question: what might be some of the<br/>alternatives, and what might their advantages or disadvantages be?<br/>The &quot;gencom&quot; looks rather like period-generator-spacing vals, but<br/>there may be distinctions here.</p><p>&gt;  There&apos;s another of my goofy ideas called a &quot;gencom&quot;, for list of generators<br/>&gt;  followed by list of commas.

As soon I saw your results, it<br/>became very clear.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105302 href="#105302">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2012 1:18:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Nov 2, 2012 at 9:20 PM, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HI, Mike.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; First, thank you so much for your comments here -- and I hope that you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and your family are OK!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yep, much better than expected!

But the reason I favor the Parapyth mapping with<br/>period-generator-spacing is not only that it&apos;s mathematically<br/>canonical, but that in theory and practice it&apos;s also intuitive,<br/>accurate, and productive of a high number of septimal and central<br/>neutral intervals with only 24 notes.</p><p>The &quot;intuitive&quot; part has to do with the fact that we&apos;re effectively<br/>stretching one fifth in a single 24-note chain by 13.968 cents in the<br/>POTE, for example, rather than using two clearly disconnected chains.<br/>In other words, the spacing is the 12-note diesis plus a bit of an<br/>artificial boost (46.272 cents + 12.067 cents).
