It DOES start up that midi playing program, and the screen<br/>comes on (although not when I set the synthesizer for &quot;full keyboard<br/>mode..&quot; only on &quot;octave&quot;..??) and SAYS it&apos;s sending sysex data someplace...</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ve checked to see that the TX81Z is set to &quot;write protect off&quot;<br/>and on midi receive channel 1.</p><p>However, nothing changes with the TX81Z tunings...</p><p>I am using a Soundblaster Awe 64 as my midi interface.  Perhaps that is the<br/>problem (??)  Basically, I went into the configuration file &quot;gsplay.cfg&quot;<br/>and changed the parameter of &quot;Midi Interface&quot; to SB.  Still nothing.</p><p>I decided that maybe I should install an old MPU401 card that I&apos;ve had<br/>sitting around to try that.  However, a friend, my &quot;computer guru&quot; was so<br/>aghast at that, he ripped it out again... so I guess I&apos;ll have to try to<br/>continue working with the Soundblaster interface or find a more &quot;modern&quot;<br/>version of the MPU401, which probably exists.</p><p>I should mention that I have to have a sequencer program &quot;up and running&quot;<br/>in order to hear sounds from my midi keyboard (midi out only) going THRU<br/>the Soundblaster (not playing it) to the TX81Z, so I was assuming that<br/>maybe all the different &quot;levels&quot; of hardware and software involved with<br/>this could create the impass...(??)</p><p>Is there some way to try to set the Soundblaster to receive data from<br/>&quot;gsplay&quot; that I am not trying??  I&apos;m not certain how to set it at all,<br/>although probably I should print out a Soundblaster on-line manual...</p><p>This may take some &quot;tweaking,&quot; but, naturally, I&apos;m anxious to hear all the<br/>different scales and possibilities of Scala...  Thanks for any possible<br/>help...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=28131 href="#28131">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/13/2001 12:19:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have not been sucessful in getting Scala to retune a midi file to<br/>the 3 or 4 et; since doing so requires no pitch bends that seems<br/>peculiar.

There is no musical intelligence behind it, that needs to<br/>come from you. It&apos;s completely static and makes no assumption<br/>about the tuning of the input file. You may hear it as 12-note<br/>music but the program doesn&apos;t know that. It just maps note number<br/>60 to scale degree 0, note number 61 to scale degree 1, etc.<br/>So if you naively use a 22-tET, or 53-tET scale of course it will<br/>sound horrible. Likewise if you want 4-tET you need to decide first<br/>which pitch classes to map to C, which to Eb, etc. This doesn&apos;t<br/>happen automatically.</p><p>&gt;1.995945186/1</p><p>&gt;I presume the last line is the problem, but how could this be done?</p><p>Input the first 14 notes and then do APPEND/FACTOR 1.995945186 and<br/>then SAVE the scale.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=28184 href="#28184">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2001 1:34:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; my paper<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I couldn&apos;t get this to download just now;</p><p>What was the problem?</p><p> is there somewhere I can<br/>&gt; access it by ftp?</p><p>Not really . . .
