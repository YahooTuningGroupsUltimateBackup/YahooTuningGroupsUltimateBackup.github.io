A capella, the jury is still out, let me study the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;literature&quot; you are referring to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it depends what you&apos;re singing.  What kind of music<br/>&gt; does your choir sing?  In what way are you trained to sing in<br/>&gt; 12-tET?  Do you rehearse with a piano?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, we rehearse with a piano, and do more difficult British<br/>music for the most part, mostly 1800-2000. (Howells, Stanford,<br/>Ireland, etc.) But I don&apos;t think people just switch into &quot;JI&quot;<br/>or &quot;Adaptive JI&quot;. I think pretty much everyone in the USA does music<br/>that is essentially 12t-ET. Think of a symphony orchestra. Sure,<br/>the strings have the flexibility of tuning intervals pure. But then<br/>it would just clash with the winds, the brass, etc. (Okay, not<br/>trombones!) I just don&apos;t think it is that cerebral. I am almost<br/>inclined to believe that if anything, choral singing is close to<br/>Pythagorean tuning, where whole steps are essentially 9/8 and half<br/>steps their square root.</p><p>Otherwise, music with augmented chords and arpeggios (Howells comes<br/>to mind here) would have the diesis all over the place and that just<br/>doesn&apos;t happen, C&apos;mon, octaves off by 42 cents? That&apos;s ridiculous!</p><p>Tribal music of Africa probably is just. But those major (natural)<br/>thirds sound strange to our ears. I am not saying the artificiality<br/>of temperament/the modern world is always an improvement, it&apos;s just<br/>a fact. We adjust to our environment. I have chemicals in my system<br/>(due to pollution, HGH, etc) that people didn&apos;t have 500 years ago.<br/>Things change.</p><p>Anyway, in summary, sure comma pumps happen in a capella singing.<br/>(I don&apos;t think the perfect fifth is an issue, 2 cents is really<br/>really close, so whole steps are essentially perfect, and 81/64<br/>major thirds reasonable.) But I am open to changing my mind. I know<br/>how hard it is the sing &quot;O sacrum convivium&quot;, (Messaien) so I am<br/>willing to admit I may be wrong. I just cannot imagine an orchestra<br/>playing &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; in anything but 12t-ET. So the same would<br/>apply for choirs singing choral music of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p><p>Having AP, I think I would know if I was singing 14 cents flat. So<br/>maybe they should get rid of singers with AP, but I&apos;ve never been<br/>accused of singing sharp. Or singing minor thirds flat. I think<br/>Occam&apos;s razor applies: It&apos;s just plain 12t-ET.

First of all, the theory we&apos;ve been<br/>discussing is very keyboard-centric.  Discrete notes don&apos;t<br/>exist in reality, they are an abstraction.  If you look at<br/>a pitch-tracker, you&apos;ll see that the majority of the time<br/>a violin is playing, it&apos;s playing &quot;connective tissue&quot; (to<br/>quote Eric Lindemann) between notes -- slides, glisses,<br/>legato goo, etc. etc.  So is this stuff in the realm of<br/>intonation theory or not?  Clearly, in an all-string<br/>ensemble, players have more in common, so there&apos;s more<br/>chance for them to sync up their intonation, and the stuff<br/>listeners do when they extract &quot;notes&quot; from string playing<br/>will all line up across instruments.  The same kind of<br/>thing holds true for winds and brass.  In a big orchestra,<br/>players intonate first with their section, and second<br/>with the entire ensemble both for this reason, and also<br/>because other instrument types are located far away and<br/>can be hard to hear.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And that&apos;s a very good comparison.

Otherwise it would not be possible, as you point<br/>out, to hear as many measurably pure (using FFT) chords in<br/>some choral performances and still finish pieces (measurably)<br/>on-pitch.  Now, I don&apos;t think they do precise adaptive JI,<br/>where the commas are spread out evenly over all melodic<br/>intervals.  But whenever full harmony drops away, people&apos;s<br/>sense of pitch causes them to right the comma drift.  The<br/>basses take a big leap, and they may insert a comma.  Also,<br/>I think people are generally glued to something closer to<br/>12-tET intonation for the diatonic scale than JI, so that does<br/>have an adaptive-JI effect.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Melody is harmony unfured, harmony is<br/>&gt; melody furled&quot; (A Scriabin).

What about the tritone? I was taught 102 102 102<br/>102<br/>&gt; &gt; 90 102 102 102 102 102 102 90 for Pythagorean. Am I misinformed?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cents are inherently irrational.  Pythagorean intonation is<br/>&gt; a form of JI, which under one definition of JI at least, means<br/>&gt; everything is a rational.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Otherwise, music with augmented chords and arpeggios (Howells<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes to mind here) would have the diesis all over the place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and that just doesn&apos;t happen, C&apos;mon, octaves off by 42 cents?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s ridiculous!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Melodic intonation can be different from harmonic intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well I goofed a little anyway cuz the last interval is a<br/>&gt; &gt; diminished fourth not a major third. But you&apos;d still be off<br/>&gt; &gt; 28 cents. I don&apos;t think choral singers differentiate between<br/>&gt; &gt; melodic and harmonic intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They do.  Otherwise it would not be possible, as you point<br/>&gt; out, to hear as many measurably pure (using FFT) chords in<br/>&gt; some choral performances and still finish pieces (measurably)<br/>&gt; on-pitch.  Now, I don&apos;t think they do precise adaptive JI,<br/>&gt; where the commas are spread out evenly over all melodic<br/>&gt; intervals.  But whenever full harmony drops away, people&apos;s<br/>&gt; sense of pitch causes them to right the comma drift.  The<br/>&gt; basses take a big leap, and they may insert a comma.  Also,<br/>&gt; I think people are generally glued to something closer to<br/>&gt; 12-tET intonation for the diatonic scale than JI, so that does<br/>&gt; have an adaptive-JI effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Melody is harmony unfured, harmony is<br/>&gt; &gt; melody furled&quot; (A Scriabin). (Is &quot;furled&quot; a word?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a lot of truth to this. . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tribal music of Africa probably is just.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you say that?  Have you listened to much tribal music<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; from Africa?  I have.  It&apos;s mostly percussion and chanting.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps you&apos;re thinking of Mbube singing?  That&apos;s not tribal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not an expert. I am thinking of the kind of African singing,<br/>&gt; &gt; usually three parts, with triads. That sounds just.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Africa is a big place.  That sort of singing is, as far as<br/>&gt; I know, a post-colonial phenomenon.  I agree it tends toward<br/>&gt; 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just cannot imagine an orchestra<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; in anything but 12-tET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The UC Berkeley orchestra did it in 2003 with no 12-tET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals audible.  The Firebird I mention above is Boulez,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Chicago &apos;93, Deutsche Grammophon 437-850-2.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the same would apply for choirs singing choral music of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 19th and 20th centuries.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would the same thing be true of choirs as is of orchestras??<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They&apos;re completely different domains.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just another comparison. Maybe not a good one. We do a lot of<br/>&gt; &gt; big works with full orchestra. It all has to be in tune. I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it&apos;s 12t-ET. Maybe it&apos;s not, convince me otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First let&apos;s talk about how closely you line up with the guy<br/>&gt; (or gal) standing next to you.  How close, in cents, do you<br/>&gt; think, as a function of time a note is sutained?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So maybe they should get rid of singers with AP, but I&apos;ve<br/>never<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been accused of singing sharp. Or singing minor thirds flat. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think Occam&apos;s razor applies: It&apos;s just plain 12t-ET. Sorry to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rain on anyone&apos;s parade.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately intonation is not something that is understood<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by musicians.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh really now. That&apos;s like saying kinesthetic awareness isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; something understood by athletes. Now you are making<br/>&gt; &gt; generalizations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hardly.  How many musicians know what meantone is, or that<br/>&gt; it was part of Western music for 300 years?  How many know<br/>&gt; the commas of the 12-tET kernel?  How many know what<br/>&gt; extended JI is, or have any practice singing or hearing<br/>&gt; 7- or 11-limit intervals?  Heck, pianists don&apos;t even know<br/>&gt; how to tune their own instruments in this culture.  Can you<br/>&gt; set equal temperament by ear on your piano?  Have you ever<br/>&gt; tried?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All this stuff is what I would consider basic, fundamental<br/>&gt; stuff about intonation that every musician should know.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve hung around some of the best conservatories, and their<br/>&gt; students don&apos;t have this knowledge.  Then consider that the<br/>&gt; vast majority of musicians work in the rock and hip-hop<br/>&gt; world...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>I need to finish some work so I will touch on all your points later.<br/>But as for this last part, all I can say is remember about<br/>&quot;intuition&quot; and &quot;talent&quot;, and that Beethoven couldn&apos;t even make<br/>change, or translate currencies (he hated math). Sure, most<br/>professional singers aren&apos;t math-brains, but they can still sing<br/>beautifully and in tune.</p><p>My friend is a vocal coach so I should ask him some of these<br/>questions. He might not know kernel-commas, but do you know about<br/>vowel-coloring, etc? It&apos;s like you said about &quot;goo&quot;, it&apos;s hard<br/>to pin anything down anyway. I read one article that even brings<br/>in quantum mechanics to indicate you can&apos;t know the frequency<br/>and position of a wave (Good grief) at any moment.

I agree it tends toward<br/>&gt; 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just cannot imagine an orchestra<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; in anything but 12-tET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The UC Berkeley orchestra did it in 2003 with no 12-tET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals audible.

Maybe not a good one. We do a lot of<br/>&gt; &gt; big works with full orchestra. It all has to be in tune. I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it&apos;s 12t-ET. Maybe it&apos;s not, convince me otherwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First let&apos;s talk about how closely you line up with the guy<br/>&gt; (or gal) standing next to you.  How close, in cents, do you<br/>&gt; think, as a function of time a note is sutained?</p><p>Do you mean, close to each other, over time, as a note is sustained?<br/>Hopefully not off by more than a few cents, especially if sustained<br/>for more than a quarter note!

However, 10 years ago, under another director,<br/>we say mixed, I never understood that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So maybe they should get rid of singers with AP, but I&apos;ve<br/>never<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been accused of singing sharp. Or singing minor thirds flat. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think Occam&apos;s razor applies: It&apos;s just plain 12t-ET. Sorry to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rain on anyone&apos;s parade.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately intonation is not something that is understood<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by musicians.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh really now. That&apos;s like saying kinesthetic awareness isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; something understood by athletes. Now you are making<br/>&gt; &gt; generalizations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hardly.  How many musicians know what meantone is, or that<br/>&gt; it was part of Western music for 300 years?  How many know<br/>&gt; the commas of the 12-tET kernel?  How many know what<br/>&gt; extended JI is, or have any practice singing or hearing<br/>&gt; 7- or 11-limit intervals?  Heck, pianists don&apos;t even know<br/>&gt; how to tune their own instruments in this culture.  Can you<br/>&gt; set equal temperament by ear on your piano?  Have you ever<br/>&gt; tried?</p><p>Yes, I learned about temperament bars real early. I worked as a piano<br/>technician (even though I didn&apos;t tune, I knew the theory.) However,<br/>I did retune my Conover grand to the celebrated &quot;5 and 7&apos;s&quot;<br/>temperament: Black keys: 5t-ET Whites: 7-tET Offset so they balance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All this stuff is what I would consider basic, fundamental<br/>&gt; stuff about intonation that every musician should know.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve hung around some of the best conservatories, and their<br/>&gt; students don&apos;t have this knowledge.  Then consider that the<br/>&gt; vast majority of musicians work in the rock and hip-hop<br/>&gt; world...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>I do get frustrated with other musicians and don&apos;t agree with the way<br/>things are. But I think that is changing. With all the technology<br/>now, and it&apos;s importance, people are owning up to science. Music<br/>used to be a science (back in the day of Mozart and Haydn) and it<br/>is high time it become one again. I say: Open up the conservatories<br/>to jazz, rock, hip hop whatever! But also teach a little science.<br/>Musicians who balance heat (emotion) with light (intellect) do the<br/>best.

Not to mention<br/>&gt; &gt; all modern brass instruments have slides, not just the<br/>&gt; &gt; trombone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But trombone is the only one where you can adjust on the fly of<br/>&gt; course. Not just a main tuning slide (you know)</p><p>Typical trumpets have two realtime slides.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instrument intonation can be viewed as sectional intonation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with small, random perturbations.  And not so small if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most violin sections.  :)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ??? So you mean string ensembles tune closer to just?</p><p>Here I meant that many (even pro) orchestral violin sections<br/>are not able to play in unison without an audible &quot;chorusing&quot;<br/>effect.  String players in early music ensembles don&apos;t tend<br/>to have this problem, and are usually trained to pay much<br/>closer attention to intonation than a classical violinist.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Generally different instrument types have different<br/>&gt; &gt; intonation tendencies.  First of all, the theory we&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; &gt; discussing is very keyboard-centric.  Discrete notes don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; exist in reality, they are an abstraction.  If you look at<br/>&gt; &gt; a pitch-tracker, you&apos;ll see that the majority of the time<br/>&gt; &gt; a violin is playing, it&apos;s playing &quot;connective tissue&quot; (to<br/>&gt; &gt; quote Eric Lindemann) between notes -- slides, glisses,<br/>&gt; &gt; legato goo, etc. etc.  So is this stuff in the realm of<br/>&gt; &gt; intonation theory or not?  Clearly, in an all-string<br/>&gt; &gt; ensemble, players have more in common, so there&apos;s more<br/>&gt; &gt; chance for them to sync up their intonation, and the stuff<br/>&gt; &gt; listeners do when they extract &quot;notes&quot; from string playing<br/>&gt; &gt; will all line up across instruments.  The same kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; thing holds true for winds and brass.  In a big orchestra,<br/>&gt; &gt; players intonate first with their section, and second<br/>&gt; &gt; with the entire ensemble both for this reason, and also<br/>&gt; &gt; because other instrument types are located far away and<br/>&gt; &gt; can be hard to hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it&apos;s not all quantifiable? A lot of people don&apos;t believe<br/>&gt; music (or art) is quantifiable AT ALL. Most people, when<br/>&gt; I talk about math and music either say &quot;Well it&apos;s the same<br/>&gt; thing&quot; (Not true) Or --- Wow, those things don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; anything in common! (Also, Not true)</p><p>It&apos;s not that it isn&apos;t quantifiable, it&apos;s just that the<br/>keyboard-centric view is a simplification that leaves<br/>some bits out.  Those bits are needed if you want to make<br/>a synthesizer sound like a violin.  Are they needed in<br/>music theory?  I guess that depends what you&apos;re trying<br/>to do.  I&apos;m suggestion they come up in a discussion of<br/>ensemble intonation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Melodic intonation can be different from harmonic intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well I goofed a little anyway cuz the last interval is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; diminished fourth not a major third. But you&apos;d still be off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 28 cents. I don&apos;t think choral singers differentiate between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; melodic and harmonic intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; They do.  Otherwise it would not be possible, as you point<br/>&gt; &gt; out, to hear as many measurably pure (using FFT) chords in<br/>&gt; &gt; some choral performances and still finish pieces (measurably)<br/>&gt; &gt; on-pitch.  Now, I don&apos;t think they do precise adaptive JI,<br/>&gt; &gt; where the commas are spread out evenly over all melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals.  But whenever full harmony drops away, people&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; sense of pitch causes them to right the comma drift.  The<br/>&gt; &gt; basses take a big leap, and they may insert a comma.  Also,<br/>&gt; &gt; I think people are generally glued to something closer to<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tET intonation for the diatonic scale than JI, so that does<br/>&gt; &gt; have an adaptive-JI effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe. So you are saying, insert a comma to fix commatic drift?<br/>&gt; Would that be an anti-comma?</p><p>It&apos;s the same comma, just inserted all at once instead of<br/>spread out like in mathematically-perfect adaptive JI.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just cannot imagine an orchestra<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; in anything but 12-tET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The UC Berkeley orchestra did it in 2003 with no 12-tET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intervals audible.

In order to &apos;sing<br/>12-ET&apos; (or play it) in any meaningful sense, you need to make both<br/>melodic and harmonic intervals<br/>1) impure, i.e. &apos;out of tune&apos; and (if harmonic) beating<br/>2) impure / beating by a particular, rather exact amount</p><p>and I contend that this is impossible for singers with or without<br/>piano accompaniment.</p><p>Sure, you can try to sing fifths a tiny bit flat and thirds rather<br/>sharp; but the result will NOT be ET in any meaningful sense, unless<br/>yon can learn to sing melodic intervals to an accuracy of 2 cents. It<br/>is more likely to be a chaotic mess that only sounds acceptable (if at<br/>all) by chance, or because some singers naturally try to approach pure<br/>intervals.</p><p>Or you can try to take your pitches from a piano; in which case the<br/>result may sometimes sound similar to ET, but is likely to deviate<br/>significantly from it in many cases, because one can&apos;t vocally<br/>reproduce or remember a pitch from the piano with all that much<br/>accuracy. Not that one would want to, since the piano doesn&apos;t even<br/>have 2:1 octaves.</p><p>Due to the piano&apos;s inharmonicity it is really impossible to take a<br/>pitch from it to any accuracy: if your fundamental is right, your<br/>second harmonic will be wrong.</p><p>Actually, Occam&apos;s razor does come in. Unless we see some definite<br/>evidence to the contrary, I think it is simplest to assume that<br/>*no-one* can sing a melodic interval, or take a pitch from a piano,<br/>with 2c accuracy. *Pure* harmonic intervals might be achieved with<br/>this accuracy by using &apos;locking&apos; between voices - i.e. beats - but it<br/>takes a tiny fraction of a second for this to be achieved.</p><p>Piano tuners manage to achieve ET by very careful attention to the<br/>beats in certain intervals, which they listen to in isolation, after<br/>checking that they are on the right side of the pure interval. (NB: a<br/>fifth that is 2c sharp sounds identical to one that is 2c flat, unless<br/>you do a direct comparison one after the other!)<br/>Choral singing is a totally different situation with, usually, much<br/>wider tolerances. In rapidly changing or dissonant harmonies, large<br/>deviations from any theoretical scheme are both possible and probable<br/>without causing noticeable artistic problems.</p><p>In practice, one starts with bad choral intonation, then works to<br/>improve it. I propose that this work is mostly and best done by<br/>singers *listening to each other* and, by using their ears, being able<br/>to approach purity both within a voice and between voices. Pure<br/>intervals are the only ones one can reliably hear and try to approach<br/>in harmony.</p><p>Not that pure intervals may ever really be reached: but that intervals<br/>become *sufficiently* pure for their musical context.</p><p>How do several basses singing the same line manage to be in tune with<br/>each other? Absolutely NOT by all listening to the piano and then<br/>independently trying to reproduce its pitches. The beating of a<br/>mistuned unison between similar timbres is strong enough that (if they<br/>listen at all!) they are practically forced into an almost-pure unison<br/>within a fraction of a second. This unison will be, of course, not so<br/>far away from the piano&apos;s, but need not and cannot be identical to it.</p><p>In the same Max Planck article, we read that &apos;some choir directors<br/>already know that in a quiet, long-held final major chord the third is<br/>to be taken somewhat flatter.&apos; What can this mean apart from that<br/>purity of intonation is desirable in some circumstances and can be<br/>achieved if a chord is to be sustained for some time?</p><p>At the same time, choirs that sing with piano cannot get too far away<br/>from its broad intonational framework. Again, due to inharmonicity<br/>and/or in rapid passages, it is really impossible to sing in tune with<br/>a piano very accurately. But it is not necessary either. It is only<br/>possible and necessary to be *sufficiently* in tune with it, given the<br/>very different timbres and envelopes of the piano and the voice.</p><p>What deviations are allowed while one remains *sufficiently* pure or<br/>in tune is an experimental question - which hasn&apos;t received that much<br/>attention, probably because of its difficulty.</p><p>Another experimental question is how well someone can detect<br/>deviations from ET in single pitches, if they have &apos;absolute pitch&apos;.<br/>Why not try tuning a piano note by note, without ever playing an<br/>interval or chord; then get out the electronic gadget and see how far<br/>off you are.</p><p>To say &apos;I could easily notice 14 cents deviation&apos; without ever having<br/>tested yourself is absurd.</p><p>I think choirs, even excellent ones with spotless intonation, probably:<br/>Sing differently in chromatic or diatonic passages<br/>Sing differently in religious or secular music<br/>Sing differently in slow or fast passages<br/>Sing differently in Renaissance or 20th century music<br/>Since each of these factors is likely to affect intonation, to try and<br/>describe real choral tuning by any fixed system of twelve (or more!)<br/>pitches is futile.</p><p>What can realistically be done? One can listen to actual pieces being<br/>performed by actual choirs and try to pick out significant features of<br/>their tuning and see if any of these theoretical prejudices can<br/>possibly be correct. Hence my link to the page with the Hilliard<br/>Ensemble sample. No, their thirds are not absolutely pure: but they<br/>are much nearer than ET is.</p><p>And yes, sometimes I hear choirs who sing thirds mighty sharp, but<br/>that doesn&apos;t make them ET; it just makes them sharp. If one absolutely<br/>wants the chord to sound shrill and aggressive then it is<br/>indispensable (and one had also better sing a slightly sharp fifth!!).</p><p>If you forced me at gunpoint to say what most choirs mostly sing I<br/>would have to say something like &apos;approximate 12-ET-based adaptive<br/>JI&apos;. Which means that the roots of chords progress approximately by ET<br/>intervals, while the other voices make approximately pure intervals<br/>with the roots.

In order<br/>to &apos;sing<br/>&gt; 12-ET&apos; (or play it) in any meaningful sense, you need to make both<br/>&gt; melodic and harmonic intervals<br/>&gt; 1) impure, i.e. &apos;out of tune&apos; and (if harmonic) beating<br/>&gt; 2) impure / beating by a particular, rather exact amount<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and I contend that this is impossible for singers with or without<br/>&gt; piano accompaniment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, you can try to sing fifths a tiny bit flat and thirds rather<br/>&gt; sharp; but the result will NOT be ET in any meaningful sense, unless<br/>&gt; yon can learn to sing melodic intervals to an accuracy of 2 cents.<br/>It<br/>&gt; is more likely to be a chaotic mess that only sounds acceptable (if<br/>at<br/>&gt; all) by chance, or because some singers naturally try to approach<br/>pure<br/>&gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or you can try to take your pitches from a piano; in which case the<br/>&gt; result may sometimes sound similar to ET, but is likely to deviate<br/>&gt; significantly from it in many cases, because one can&apos;t vocally<br/>&gt; reproduce or remember a pitch from the piano with all that much<br/>&gt; accuracy. Not that one would want to, since the piano doesn&apos;t even<br/>&gt; have 2:1 octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Due to the piano&apos;s inharmonicity it is really impossible to take a<br/>&gt; pitch from it to any accuracy: if your fundamental is right, your<br/>&gt; second harmonic will be wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, Occam&apos;s razor does come in. Unless we see some definite<br/>&gt; evidence to the contrary, I think it is simplest to assume that<br/>&gt; *no-one* can sing a melodic interval, or take a pitch from a piano,<br/>&gt; with 2c accuracy. *Pure* harmonic intervals might be achieved with<br/>&gt; this accuracy by using &apos;locking&apos; between voices - i.e. beats - but<br/>it<br/>&gt; takes a tiny fraction of a second for this to be achieved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Piano tuners manage to achieve ET by very careful attention to the<br/>&gt; beats in certain intervals, which they listen to in isolation, after<br/>&gt; checking that they are on the right side of the pure interval. (NB:<br/>a<br/>&gt; fifth that is 2c sharp sounds identical to one that is 2c flat,<br/>unless<br/>&gt; you do a direct comparison one after the other!)<br/>&gt; Choral singing is a totally different situation with, usually, much<br/>&gt; wider tolerances. In rapidly changing or dissonant harmonies, large<br/>&gt; deviations from any theoretical scheme are both possible and<br/>probable<br/>&gt; without causing noticeable artistic problems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In practice, one starts with bad choral intonation, then works to<br/>&gt; improve it. I propose that this work is mostly and best done by<br/>&gt; singers *listening to each other* and, by using their ears, being<br/>able<br/>&gt; to approach purity both within a voice and between voices. Pure<br/>&gt; intervals are the only ones one can reliably hear and try to<br/>approach<br/>&gt; in harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not that pure intervals may ever really be reached: but that<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; become *sufficiently* pure for their musical context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How do several basses singing the same line manage to be in tune<br/>with<br/>&gt; each other? Absolutely NOT by all listening to the piano and then<br/>&gt; independently trying to reproduce its pitches. The beating of a<br/>&gt; mistuned unison between similar timbres is strong enough that (if<br/>they<br/>&gt; listen at all!) they are practically forced into an almost-pure<br/>unison<br/>&gt; within a fraction of a second. This unison will be, of course, not<br/>so<br/>&gt; far away from the piano&apos;s, but need not and cannot be identical to<br/>it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the same Max Planck article, we read that &apos;some choir directors<br/>&gt; already know that in a quiet, long-held final major chord the third<br/>is<br/>&gt; to be taken somewhat flatter.&apos; What can this mean apart from that<br/>&gt; purity of intonation is desirable in some circumstances and can be<br/>&gt; achieved if a chord is to be sustained for some time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the same time, choirs that sing with piano cannot get too far<br/>away<br/>&gt; from its broad intonational framework. Again, due to inharmonicity<br/>&gt; and/or in rapid passages, it is really impossible to sing in tune<br/>with<br/>&gt; a piano very accurately. But it is not necessary either. It is only<br/>&gt; possible and necessary to be *sufficiently* in tune with it, given<br/>the<br/>&gt; very different timbres and envelopes of the piano and the voice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What deviations are allowed while one remains *sufficiently* pure or<br/>&gt; in tune is an experimental question - which hasn&apos;t received that<br/>much<br/>&gt; attention, probably because of its difficulty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another experimental question is how well someone can detect<br/>&gt; deviations from ET in single pitches, if they have &apos;absolute pitch&apos;.<br/>&gt; Why not try tuning a piano note by note, without ever playing an<br/>&gt; interval or chord; then get out the electronic gadget and see how<br/>far<br/>&gt; off you are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To say &apos;I could easily notice 14 cents deviation&apos; without ever<br/>having<br/>&gt; tested yourself is absurd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think choirs, even excellent ones with spotless intonation,<br/>probably:<br/>&gt; Sing differently in chromatic or diatonic passages<br/>&gt; Sing differently in religious or secular music<br/>&gt; Sing differently in slow or fast passages<br/>&gt; Sing differently in Renaissance or 20th century music<br/>&gt; Since each of these factors is likely to affect intonation, to try<br/>and<br/>&gt; describe real choral tuning by any fixed system of twelve (or more!)<br/>&gt; pitches is futile.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What can realistically be done? One can listen to actual pieces<br/>being<br/>&gt; performed by actual choirs and try to pick out significant features<br/>of<br/>&gt; their tuning and see if any of these theoretical prejudices can<br/>&gt; possibly be correct. Hence my link to the page with the Hilliard<br/>&gt; Ensemble sample. No, their thirds are not absolutely pure: but they<br/>&gt; are much nearer than ET is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And yes, sometimes I hear choirs who sing thirds mighty sharp, but<br/>&gt; that doesn&apos;t make them ET; it just makes them sharp. If one<br/>absolutely<br/>&gt; wants the chord to sound shrill and aggressive then it is<br/>&gt; indispensable (and one had also better sing a slightly sharp<br/>fifth!!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you forced me at gunpoint to say what most choirs mostly sing I<br/>&gt; would have to say something like &apos;approximate 12-ET-based adaptive<br/>&gt; JI&apos;. Which means that the roots of chords progress approximately by<br/>ET<br/>&gt; intervals, while the other voices make approximately pure intervals<br/>&gt; with the roots. The degree of approximation depends, as I said, very<br/>&gt; heavily on the context, and may (by absolute standards) be very good<br/>&gt; one minute but lousy the next.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~</p><p>Some good thoughts.</p><p>I have tested my pitch by retuning my own keyboard (easy to do)<br/>14 cents is almost 1/7 of a half step, very easy to distinguish.<br/>So I don&apos;t agree with you on that.</p><p>I don&apos;t agree that inharmonicity is a problem. Choirs only have<br/>(about) a four octave range, and most of the music is in two<br/>octaves.</p><p>I don&apos;t agree that switching from secular to sacred music (an<br/>artificial division anyway) or classical to popular (another<br/>artificial division) is going to affect how I tune or harmonize.<br/>An exception would be barbershop quartet singing. I agree with you<br/>there.</p><p>I got a little lost in your discussion of pure intervals. Do you<br/>mean pure tempered or just ones? Obviously there is no beating<br/>in just intervals.</p><p>Wow being a second bass, guess (according to you) I am setting<br/>the pitch, since I always sing the lowest line. I&apos;m afraid I<br/>don&apos;t think it is that simple. Even though it is funny that you<br/>are saying the bassline is essentially 12-tET.</p><p>Slow or fast is a relative term. How slow is slow? It&apos;s true that<br/>in fast singing, you just do your best and come close.</p><p>Diatonic / chromatic is a relative term. It&apos;s true, some music<br/>has almost no accidentals, some is cluttered with them. So is<br/>F-F# chromatic, while F-Gb diatonic? Do I sing them differently?<br/>I know that I don&apos;t.</p><p>You have some good points, but I&apos;ve been singing (almost unbroken)<br/>in some kind of choir or another since I was 5. It&apos;s fun to<br/>try to reconcile what I have learned about tuning with what I<br/>experience. (Also sang in St. Olaf Choir 3 years, mostly all<br/>a capella singing, always from memory, if you don&apos;t know, that this<br/>choir traditionally set the standard for this kind of singing<br/>in the midwest for most of the 20th century). I am just saying<br/>I have a little experience. Doesn&apos;t mean I think I&apos;m right about<br/>everything. I just don&apos;t think it&apos;s that cerebral, and I don&apos;t think<br/>tuning varies as much as you are saying it does.</p><p>2 cents accuracy? No of course not. The tempered fifth is so<br/>close that it is essentially a non-issue.</p><p>I agree with you about approximate 12-ET based adaptive JI&quot; and<br/>although few would agree with me, I would almost say &quot;approximate<br/>12-ET based adaptive Pythagorean tuning&quot; even though I am sure<br/>most of you would jump on me for indicating major thirds as big<br/>as 81/64.</p><p>Would like to see some experimental data. Otherwise we might<br/>as well be arguing about string theory.</p><p>PGH</p></div><h3><a id=71856 href="#71856">ðŸ”—</a>Paul G Hjelmstad &#x3C;paul.hjelmstad@us.ing.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2007 11:25:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please take this back, or rephrase, or something.

Groups that specialize in early music<br/>tend to sing in a different style than groups coming from<br/>a common-practice angle (like yours), and that includes<br/>intonation.  As for your group, I&apos;m sure intonation depends<br/>on the sustain of consonances in the score.  For something<br/>like a chorale (which both the Missa Solemnis and the 9th<br/>Symphony contain), where every beat is a quarter-note triad,<br/>you will be pulled to JI vertically.  You may not succeed,<br/>but if you can hear the other parts at all (admitedly this<br/>depends on the size of your sections and the room you<br/>rehearse in), you can scarcely be pulled any other way.  In<br/>faster-moving passages, or when singing more complex chords,<br/>the story may be different.  If a piano is playing the parts<br/>(not a separate keyboard part), that will also have an effect.</p><p>In the broader picture, the primary type of chord used to<br/>make harmony (i.e. triads or tetrads) in music is also an<br/>intonation issue (something we study on these lists), on top<br/>of the issue of how close to JI they are typically performed.</p><p>On another note: have you ever heard a harpsichord in<br/>equal temperament?  This is not something that&apos;s easy to<br/>find.  You have to go back to recordings from the &apos;50s and<br/>&apos;60s.  If you have heard one, did you find it objectionable?<br/>Most early music buffs do -- one friend of mine rebuffed me<br/>for it immediately upon entering my car, where I was<br/>playing a Scarlatti recording by Valenti.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=71862 href="#71862">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2007 10:55:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; Melodic discrimination isn&apos;t much worse than harmonic,<br/>&gt; actually.
