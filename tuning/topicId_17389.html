Alternative melodic nuances<br/>--------------------------------</p><p>Although these &quot;necessary&quot; comma shifts are often desirable and indeed<br/>delectable, we often have available alternative forms of progressions<br/>featuring the same vertical sonorities but altered melodic cadential<br/>steps not calling for such shifts. The result is a yet expanded<br/>universe of choices.</p><p>To illustrate these alternative forms, let us consider the three comma<br/>shift sequences we have just explored, beginning with our first<br/>sequence with a chain of expansive resolutions from sixth sonorities<br/>to trines:</p><p>1    2   | 1     2   &amp;    | 1          1    2   | 1    2  &amp;    | 1<br/>F4   G^4   A^4   G^4 F#^4   G4        F4   G^4    A4   G4 F#^4   G4<br/>F4   D^4   E^4   D^4 C#^4   D4        F4   D^4    E4   D4 C#^4   D4<br/>Bb3        A^3       A3     G3        Bb3         A3             G3</p><p>(standard steps, comma shift)             (alternative steps)</p><p>Both our original version with standard melodic steps and our new<br/>alternative version share identical tunings for vertical sonorities:<br/>trines are at 2:3:4, cadential sixth sonorities at 7:9:12, and the<br/>mildly unstable quintal/quartal sonority in the second measure<br/>(A^3-D^4-G^4 or A3-D4-G4) at 9:12:16.</p><p>The subtle difference, which makes a comma shift unnecessary in our<br/>new version, occurs in the first remissive resolution involving the<br/>sixth sonority Bb3-D^4-G^4, which progresses in the standard manner to<br/>A^3-E^4-A^4 at the beginning of the second measure in our original<br/>example, but to A3-E4-A4 on the lower keyboard in this variant.</p><p>With the lowest voice now poised on A3, we can move through the<br/>connecting sonority A3-D4-G4 (a septimal comma lower than in the<br/>original verson) to the sixth sonority A3-C#^4-F#^4, available at the<br/>desired 7:9:12 without the need for any comma shift, and followed by a<br/>standard intensive resolution to G3-D4-G4 as in the first version.</p><p>Looking more closely at the two versions of the remissive resolution<br/>of Bb3-D^4-G^4, we can see the altered melodic steps in the second<br/>version which have made it possible to maintain vertical sonorities at<br/>the simplest ratios while avoiding any comma shifts:</p><p>    G^4  A^3              G^4  A4<br/>    D^4  E^3              D^4  E4<br/>    Bb3  A^3              Bb3  A3</p><p>(standard steps)    (alternative steps)</p><p>In the standard 7-flavor version, we have the descending semitone<br/>Bb3-A^3 in the lowest voice at 28:27, and ascending whole-tones<br/>D^4-E^4 and G^4-A^4 in the two upper voices at 9:8.</p><p>In our alternative version, however, we have a descending semitone<br/>Bb3-A3 at the usual Pythagorean 256:243 or a rounded 90 cents, a<br/>septimal comma larger than 28:27 at 63 cents; and whole-tone steps of<br/>D^4-E4 and G^4-A4, a septimal comma narrower than the standard 9:8, or<br/>about 177 cents rather than the usual 204 cents. More precisely, this<br/>small whole-tone has a ratio equal to 9:8 divided by the 64:63 comma,<br/>or 567:512 (~176.65 cents).</p><p>A yet closer look at fine intonational structure reveals how both<br/>versions involve identical vertical intervals, but with differently<br/>allocated melodic motions. Numbers in parentheses show vertical<br/>intervals between each voice and any higher voices, while signed<br/>numbers show ascending or descending melodic steps in each voice:</p><p>         standard 7-flavor                     alternative 7-flavor</p><p>     G^4 ------ +204 ----- A^4                G^4 ----- +177 ----- A4<br/>    (498)                 (498)              (498)               (498)<br/>     D^4 ------ +204 ----- E^4                D^4 ----- +177 ----- E4<br/>  (933,435)            (1200,702)          (933,435)           (1200,702)<br/>     Bb3 ------  -63 ----- A^3                Bb3 -----  -90 ----- A3</p><p>            (M6-8 + M3-5)                           (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>Both versions feature two-voice resolutions expanding from a 9:7 major<br/>third at a rounded 435 cents to a fifth, and from a 12:7 major sixth<br/>at 933 cents to an octave, in either case involving expansion over a<br/>total distance of 267 cents (the size of the 7:6 minor third, ~266.87<br/>cents).</p><p>In the standard version, this distance is allocated between a<br/>supercompact descending semitone of 28:27 or 63 cents, and a usual<br/>Pythagorean whole-tone of 9:8 or 204 cents. In the alternative<br/>version, we have a usual Pythagorean semitone of 256:243 or 90 cents,<br/>and small or compressed whole-tones at 567:512 or 177 cents.</p><p>By using these alternative melodic steps for remissive cadences, we<br/>can extend our &quot;septimal comma pump&quot; sequence of sixth sonorities<br/>while avoiding comma shifts -- or, for a hypothetical ensemble of<br/>variable-pitch performers, comma drift:</p><p>1   2  | 1   2  &amp;   | 1   2   | 1   2   | 1     2    | 1<br/>F4  G^4  A4  G4 F#^4  G4  E^4   F4  D^4   E4  C#^4   D4<br/>F4  D^4  E4  D4 C#^4  D4  B^3   C4  A^3   B3  G#^3   A3<br/>Bb3      A3           G3        F3        E3         D3</p><p>Interestingly, this style of adaptive JI involves regular Pythagorean<br/>steps (9:8, 256:243) in the lowest voice, with three varieties of<br/>whole-tone steps in the upper voices: the usual 9:8 at 204 cents; the<br/>large 8:7 at 231 cents, a septimal comma wider (F4-G^4 in the highest<br/>voice, measure 1); and the small 567:512 at 177 cents, a septimal<br/>comma narrower (e.g. D^4-E4 and G^4-A4, measures 1-2). Intensive<br/>resolutions retain standard supercompact 28:27 semitones at 63 cents<br/>in the upper voices (e.g. C#^4-D4, F#^4-G4, measures 2-3).</p><p>Here is the same alternative approach applied to our second sequence:</p><p>1    2   3  | 1   2    3 | 1        1    2   3  | 1   2    3 | 1<br/>G^4  F4       E^4 F#^4     G4       G^4  F4       E4  F#^4     G4<br/>D^4  Bb3      A^3 C#^4     D4       D^4  Bb3      A3  C#^4     D4<br/>G^3           A^3 A3       G3       G^3           A3           G3</p><p>      (standard version)                (alternative version)</p><p>The first remissive cadence in the sequence involving the contractive<br/>minor seventh sonority G^3-Bb3-F4 now resolves to the fifth A3-E4,<br/>instead of the standard A^3-E^4 on the upper keyboard, again making<br/>possible a move to the next cadential sonority A3-C#^4-F#^4 without a<br/>comma shift, resolving in either version to G3-D4-G4. Here is an<br/>intonational diagram of the remissive seventh sonority cadence in its<br/>two versions:</p><p>         standard 7-flavor                     alternative 7-flavor</p><p>     F4  ------  -63 ----- E^4                F4  -----  -90 ----- E4<br/>    (702)                 (702)              (702)               (702)<br/>     Bb4 ------  -63 ----- A^3                Bb4 -----  -90 ----- A3<br/>  (969,267)              (702,0)           (969,267)            (702,0)<br/>     G^3 ------ +204 ----- A^3                G^3 ----- +177 ----- A3</p><p>            (m7-5 + m3-1)                           (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>In either version, the two-voice resolutions from a 7:6 minor third to<br/>a unison, and from a 7:4 minor seventh to a fifth, involve a total<br/>contraction of 267 cents -- allocated between motions of a 63-cent<br/>descending semitone and a 204-cent ascending whole-tone in the<br/>standard version, and a 90-cent semitone and a 177-cent whole-tone in<br/>the alternative version.</p><p>The same altered steps also give us the option of avoiding comma<br/>shifts in our third sequence:</p><p>1    2   3  | 1   2    3 | 1        1    2   3  | 1   2    3 | 1<br/>G^4  F4       E^4 F#^4     G4       G^4  F4       E4  F#^4     G4<br/>D^4           A^3 E3       D4       D^4           A3           D4<br/>G^3           A^3 A3       G3       G^3           A3           G3</p><p>      (standard version)                (alternative version)</p><p>The contrast between these versions may facilitate meaningful musical<br/>statements and structures. For example, one might use the alternative<br/>version without comma shifts for the first statement of a passage, and<br/>the standard version with its striking double comma shift for a<br/>repetition with a new and distinctive element.</p><p>Certain progressions permit three alternative melodic interpretations<br/>all sharing the same vertical intervals, as with the following<br/>neo-Gothic resolution from a quintal/quartal sonority of 8:9:12 to a<br/>complete trine featuring a directed resolution between the lower<br/>voices from a vertical major second to a fifth:</p><p>  (standard 3-flavor)           (variant 1)              (variant 2)</p><p>   C4 -- +408 -- E4           C4 -- +435 -- E^4       C^4 -- +381 -- E4<br/>  (498)         (498)       (498)          (498)     (498)         (498)<br/>   G3 -- +408 -- B3           G3 -- +435 -- B^3       G^3 -- +381 -- B3<br/>(702,204)     (1200,702)  (702,204)     (1200,702)  (702,204)    (1200,702)<br/>   F3 --  -90 -- E3           F3 --  -63 -- E^3       F^3 -- -117 -- E3</p><p>        (M2-5)                      (M2-5)                  (M2-5)</p><p>The melodic semitones and major thirds, suggesting a certain<br/>&quot;pelog-like&quot; affinity, are open to three nuances. In a standard<br/>Pythagorean or 3-flavor version, they have sizes of 256:243 and 81:64,<br/>or 90/408 cents. In a version with 7-flavor steps, moving from the<br/>lower to the upper manual, they have an accentuated polarity at sizes<br/>of 28:27 and 9:7, or 63/435 cents. In a version where they are altered<br/>by a septimal comma in the opposite direction, moving from the upper<br/>to the lower manual, they have sizes of 16384:15309 and 5103:4096, or<br/>117/381 cents (more precisely 117.49 cents and 380.56 cents).[21]</p><p>Comma shifts and nuances, in addition to providing what can be<br/>beautiful &quot;special effect&quot; progressions, add another dimension of<br/>musical choice and contrast, along with such dimensions of choice as<br/>3-flavor/7-flavor, expansive/contractive, or intensive/remissive.<br/>&quot;Intonational necessity,&quot; in the 21st century as at other points in<br/>history, can often be synonymous with artistic opportunity.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>4.3. Special sonorities: the Erlichan ninth and near-11:8<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Along with cadential changes of flavor, comma shifts, and related<br/>melodic nuances, our neo-Gothic JI system features some special<br/>vertical sonorities. Here we consider two: a major ninth sonority of<br/>the kind described by Paul Erlich, having in this tuning pure ratios<br/>of 4:6:7:9 (e.g. A^3-E^4-G4-B^4); and a cadential major sixth sonority<br/>featuring a near-11:8 superfourth, to use Dave Keenan&apos;s fitting term,<br/>between the two upper voices (e.g. B3-Eb4-G#^4).</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>4.3.1. The Erlichan ninth (4:6:7:9)<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>Growing out of a suggestion by Paul Erlich[22], the neo-Gothic<br/>&quot;Erlichan ninth&quot; sonority consists of a fifth, minor seventh, and<br/>major ninth above the lowest voice. In a pure 7-flavor tuning of the<br/>kind available in our 24-note system, this sonority features just<br/>ratios of 4:6:7:9 (a rounded 0-702-969-1404 cents), for example<br/>A^3-E^4-G4-B^4.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic point of view, this sonority has a complex and<br/>&quot;different&quot; sound, one might say &quot;xenharmonic&quot; in a very enchanting<br/>sense. Its beguiling complexity is coupled with the property that all<br/>six intervals have some degree of &quot;compatibility&quot; by 13th-century<br/>standards: two ideally blending fifths; a relatively blending major<br/>third and minor third; and a relatively tense minor seventh and major<br/>ninth. There are no acutely tense intervals (m2, M7, A4, d5).</p><p>Although various resolutions are possible, the following directed<br/>progression is especially favored and characteristic:</p><p>              B^4  C5<br/>              G4   F4<br/>              E^4  F4<br/>              A^3  F3</p><p>       (M9-12 + m3-1 + M3-5)</p><p>In this resolution, the outer 9:4 major ninth expands to a twelfth,<br/>while the upper 7:6 minor third E^4-G3 and 9:7 major third G4-B^4<br/>respectively contract to a unison and expand to a fifth.</p><p>While the pure 7-flavor tuning of 4:6:7:9 may be of special interest<br/>here, this sonority and its majestic resolution are very beautiful<br/>also in regular Pythagorean intonation, where the Erlichan ninth has a<br/>more complex ratio of 36:54:64:81 (0-702-996-1404 cents), and in a<br/>variety of neo-Gothic temperaments.</p><p>To understand the musical logic of this characteristic resolution, we<br/>may approach it as superimposing or uniting two three-voice<br/>progrssions of the Gothic era, here shown in their traditional<br/>Pythagorean tuning:</p><p>B4  C5      B4 C5<br/>E4  F4      G4 F4<br/>A3  F3      E4 F4</p><p>(M9-12)  (m3-1 + M3-5)</p><p>The first progression involves a sonority favored by Jacobus of Liege<br/>(c. 1325) featuring an outer major ninth &quot;split&quot; into two fifths. In<br/>this resolution, the outer ninth expands to a twelfth by near-conjunct<br/>contrary motion, the upper voice ascending by a semitone and the lower<br/>voice descending by a major third.</p><p>The second progression is a very common resolution of the _quinta<br/>fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; of Jacobus (a fifth &quot;split&quot; into a major and<br/>minor third), with the minor third contracting to a unison and the<br/>major third expanding to a fifth.</p><p>Since the &quot;Erlichan ninth&quot; (4:6:7:9 in its simplest tuning) can be<br/>seen as a variant on the _nona fissa_ or &quot;split ninth&quot; of Jacobus with<br/>its two ideally concordant fifths (4:6:9), it has the fuller name in<br/>neo-Gothic theory of _nona fissa Erlichana_ or &quot;Erlichan split ninth.&quot;</p><p>The Erlichan ninth is an example of a neo-Gothic sonority I might<br/>never have conceived on my own, but which adorns the style in a very<br/>special way, a xenharmonic &quot;stranger&quot; very happily adopted.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>4.3.2. A hybrid sixth sonority: the near-11:8 superfourth<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In addition to the usual complement of 3-flavor and 7-flavor cadential<br/>resolutions, our adaptive rational tuning includes a special form of<br/>expansive sixth sonority combining a Pythagorean diminished fourth or<br/>schisma major third very close to 5:4 with a pure 12:7 major sixth,<br/>e.g. B3-Eb4-G#^4 (a rounded 0-384-933 cents). This arrangement results<br/>in an interval of about 549 cents between the two upper voices, a<br/>near-pure 11:8 &quot;super fourth&quot; as Dave Keenan[23] aptly describes it.</p><p>The standard resolution of this hybrid sixth sonority follows a<br/>familiar pattern, with the major third expanding to a fifth and the<br/>major sixth to an octave:</p><p>            G#^4  A4<br/>            Eb4  E4<br/>            B3   A3</p><p>         (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>Here the diminished fourth B3-Eb4 (8192:6561, ~384.36 cents) is a<br/>Pythagorean comma narrower (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents) than a<br/>regular major third at 81:64, while the 7-flavor major sixth B3-G#^4<br/>at 12:7 (~933.13 cents) is a septimal comma or 64:63 (~27.26 cents)<br/>wider than a regular Pythagorean major sixth at 27:16.</p><p>The fourth between the two upper voices is enlarged beyond a pure 4:3<br/>by the sum of these two commas, 59049:57344 or ~50.72 cents, yielding<br/>an interval of 19683:14336 or ~548.77 cents, happily close to a pure<br/>a pure 11:8 at ~551.32 cents, falling short by about 2.55 cents.[24]</p><p>This superfourth can have a quality at once tart, lending impetus to<br/>cadential action, and yet engagingly smooth and tranquil. Together<br/>with the other intervals of this combination, it offers a variation on<br/>the theme of expansive sixth sonorities at once recognizable and<br/>quite unique in flavor.</p><p>A closer intonational look shows how the contrast between the narrow<br/>major third and wide major sixth is reflected in the disparity of<br/>melodic semitonal motions in this cadence:</p><p>                   G#^4 ------  +63 ----- A4<br/>                  (549)                  (498)<br/>                   Eb4  ------ +114 ----- E4<br/>                (933,384)             (1200,702)<br/>                   B3   ------ -204 ----- A3</p><p>The diminished fourth B3-Eb4 is a Pythagorean comma narrower than a<br/>regular major third, and must expand by this extra distance to reach<br/>the resolving fifth A3-E4 -- a total expansion of about 318 cents.[25]<br/>Its upper voice ascends by a 114-cent chromatic semitone or apotome<br/>Eb4-E4 (2187:2048, ~113.69 cents) rather than the regular 90-cent<br/>diatonic semitone at an incisive 256:243, while the lowest voice<br/>descends by a usual 204-cent whole-tone at 9:8 (B3-A3).</p><p>The major sixth B3-G#^4 at a pure 12:7 expands in standard 7-flavor<br/>fashion to the outer octave of the resolving trine A3-E4-A4, its upper<br/>voice ascending by a supercompact 63-cent semitone at 28:27 (G#^4-A4).<br/>Here a total expansion of only about 267 cents is required.</p><p>An idiom highlighting the unique color of this progression is to<br/>combine it with a variant on the &quot;commatic genus&quot; of melody described<br/>by Johannes Boen in 1357 and used by Guillaume le Grant in the early<br/>15th century (Section 4.1.2) featuring two consecutive semitones:</p><p>Bb4  A4  G#^4 A4<br/>F4   E4  Eb4  E4<br/>D4   C4  B3   A3</p><p>The disparate chains of melodic semitones in the two upper voices<br/>(Bb4-A4-G#^4, 90-63 cents; F4-E4-Eb4, 90-114 cents) add to the drama<br/>of the cadential sonority B3-Eb4-G#^4, with its superfourth mirroring<br/>this disparity.</p><p>Idioms of this kind grow out of an intonational serendipity common to<br/>various musical styles and tuning systems. Although our neo-Gothic JI<br/>system is based on ratios of 2, 3, and 7, approximations of other<br/>ratios such as 5:4 or 11:8 do arise in the &quot;cracks&quot; of the system.<br/>These &quot;unusual&quot; intervals, like the augmented and diminished intervals<br/>of meantone during the Manneristic Era around 1600, can serve as the<br/>figures of a musical rhetoric opening new vistas of expression.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>4.4. Oblique resolutions: 27:14 and 14:9<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>In this survey, we have focused mainly on cadences involving directed<br/>progressions by contrary motion, but 7-flavor intervals such as the<br/>major seventh at 27:14 (~1137.04 cents) and minor sixth at 14:9<br/>(~764.92 cents) can have an especially evocative effect in certain<br/>resolutions by oblique motion. Here we consider two such resolutions<br/>favored by composers such as Perotin and some of his 13th-century<br/>successors, and available either in traditional 3-flavor versions or<br/>new 7-flavor versions.</p><p>A most ear-catching opening in Perotin commences on a sonority with<br/>fifth and major seventh above the lowest voice (128:192:243, a rounded<br/>0-702-1110 cents), the major seventh obliquely resolving to the octave<br/>of a complete trine:</p><p>E4  F4<br/>C4<br/>F3</p><p>This compelling flourish, with the acute Pythagorean major seventh and<br/>the bright major third between the upper voices at 81:64 incisively<br/>resolved to outer octave and upper fourth by the 90-cent semitone<br/>motion of the highest voice, sets the stage for a composition in<br/>Perotin&apos;s architectonic style.</p><p>Jacobus of Liege may be alluding to this kind of figure when he<br/>follows 13th-century tradition in placing the major seventh among the<br/>unequivocal or &quot;incompatible&quot; discords (along with m2, A4 or d5, and<br/>also m6), but adds the qualification, &quot;unless it proceeds to the<br/>octave.&quot;[26)</p><p>The 7-flavor variation on this classic figure seems yet more intense<br/>and with its &quot;superacute&quot; 27:14 major seventh and 9:7 major<br/>third (14:21:27, 0-702-1137 cents):</p><p>E^4 F4<br/>C4<br/>F3</p><p>These unstable intervals get a &quot;superincisive&quot; resolution by way of<br/>the 28:27 semitone E^4-F4 at 63 cents, a septimal comma narrower than<br/>in the classic Pythagorean version.</p><p>A different kind of oblique resolution, this time with a descending<br/>rather than ascending melodic semitone, proceeds from the minor sixth<br/>to the fifth. Often ranked together with the major seventh in<br/>13th-century theory as acutely tense, the minor sixth at its usual<br/>Pythagorean size of 128:81 (~792.18 cents) can have a quality at once<br/>edgy and languid[27], as in this final cadence:</p><p>F4  E4<br/>A3</p><p>The 7-flavor variation with a 14:9 minor sixth seems to me more gentle<br/>and mellow in its languidity, this interval resolving by the 63-cent<br/>semitone step F4-E^4:</p><p>F4  E^4<br/>A^3</p><p>The tension of this resolution in either flavor can be enhanced by<br/>adding the fifth above the lowest voice, with a 90-cent (3-flavor) or<br/>63-cent (7-flavor) vertical semitone between the upper parts resolved<br/>to a unison as the outer minor sixth resolves to a fifth:</p><p>(3-flavor)     (7-flavor)</p><p> F4  E4         F4  E^4<br/> E4             E^4<br/> A3             A^3</p><p>These idioms are meant only as a sampler: 13th-century sonorities with<br/>intervals such as minor seconds, minor sixths, and major sevenths<br/>participate in a variety of resolutions by directed contrary motion as<br/>well as oblique motion[28], and invite enthusiastic interpretations in<br/>a range of flavors.</p><p>----------------<br/>Notes to Part IV<br/>----------------</p><p>21. In each instance the sum of these two melodic steps is a pure 4:3<br/>fourth at a rounded 498 cents, the distance by which the unstable<br/>major second of the first sonority expands to reach a pure fifth, and<br/>the outer fifth of the first sonority expands to reach the octave of<br/>the resolving trine.</p><p>22. Paul Erlich&apos;s original query concerned a possible neo-Gothic use<br/>for the more complex 11-limit sonority 4:6:7:9:11 found in 22-tone<br/>equal temperament (22-tET). Experimentation suggested to me that this<br/>sonority seemed a bit too complex or &quot;dissonant&quot; for a usual<br/>neo-Gothic setting, but that the subset 4:6:7:9 had just the right<br/>blend of complexity and &quot;compatibility&quot; to fit this musical language<br/>in a way at once strange and beautiful.</p><p>23.

From another viewpoint, this superfourth Eb4-G#^4 is a septimal<br/>comma wider than the Pythagorean augmented third or &quot;Wolf fourth&quot;<br/>Eb4-G#4 at 177147:131072 (~521.51 cents), itself a Pythagorean comma<br/>larger than a pure 4:3 fourth. Although the Wolf fourth is much less<br/>smooth than the superfourth as a bare interval, proverbially being<br/>named for the resemblance of its beating to the howling of wolves, it<br/>can also have a pleasant effect in a sixth sonority such as B3-Eb4-G#4<br/>(0-384-906 cents) resolving to A3-E4-A4. In the early 15th century,<br/>when the 12-note Pythagorean tuning Gb-B was popular, this sonority<br/>may often have occurred at written cadences of D3-F#3-B3 (realized as<br/>D3-Gb3-B3) to C3-G3-C4. Mark Lindley suggests that the cadential<br/>context and the tuning of D-Gb3 very close to a pure 5:4 serve to<br/>&quot;alleviate&quot; the musical effect of the Wolf fourth, see &quot;Pythagorean<br/>Intonation and the Rise of the Triad,&quot; _Royal Musical Association<br/>Research Chronicle_ 16:4-61 at 43 (1980), ISSN 0080-4460.</p><p>25. This total distance of expansion is equal to the size of the<br/>Pythagorean augmented second or wide minor third, more precisely<br/>19683:16384 (~317.60 cents).</p><p>26. Johannes de Garlandia (c. 1240?) states that any discord becomes<br/>&quot;equivalent to concord&quot; when duly resolved to a stable interval. The<br/>view of the major seventh as a strong dissonance may be common to many<br/>eras of European composed music, and Bartok&apos;s famous piece &quot;Major<br/>Sevenths, Minor Seconds&quot; presents an alternative to this tradition,<br/>just as new or unfamiliar tunings may challenge conventions as to what<br/>is &quot;out of tune.&quot;</p><p>27. While any interval in the general &quot;minor sixth&quot; region may have a<br/>rather high level of acoustical complexity, tension, or &quot;entropy,&quot; the<br/>Pythagorean 792.18 cents interestingly coincides almost exactly with<br/>the area of maximal complexity as predicted by the &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; of<br/>the simplest neighboring ratios 3:2 and 8:5, a mediant weighted by the<br/>Golden Ratio or Phi at ~1.61803398874989484820459, i.e.</p><p>           3 + 8 Phi   15.9442719<br/>           --------- = ---------- = 1.5801787 = ~792.105 cents<br/>           2 + 5 Phi   10.0901699</p><p>See, e.g., Margo Schulter and David Keenan, &quot;The Golden Mediant:<br/>Complex ratios and metastable musical intervals,&quot; TD 810:3, 18<br/>September 2000; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915;">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915;</a> the term<br/>&quot;Noble Mediant&quot; is now preferred, as suggested by Dave Keenan.</p><p>28.
