Dave Keenan (in a TD post way back<br/>last winter) took a look at this algorithm and empirically determined<br/>~2.90708338 (or 125/43) to be the best magic number due to its maximum<br/>underlying error of only +/- ~1.5 cents. When Dave says &quot;underlying<br/>error&quot; he means an error apart from those due to rounding the<br/>numerator and denominator to the nearest integers. So in other words,<br/>in 15e if we let x = 125/43, then we have underlying errors of +/- .6,<br/>1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 1.2, .5, and .7 cents:</p><p> 1.014 /  1.014<br/>22.302 / 21.302<br/>45.605 / 41.605<br/>23.302 / 20.302<br/>47.605 / 39.605<br/>24.302 / 19.302<br/>49.605 / 37.605<br/>25.302 / 18.302</p><p>and rounded errors of +/- 0.54, 2.51, 1.96, 4.36, 4.44, 4.89, and 8.72<br/>cents:</p><p>25/36, 25/38, 12/19, 3/5, 23/40, 23/42, 11/21, 1/1, 22/21, 23/21,<br/>23/20, 6/5, 24/19, 25/19, 25/18</p><p>Or if we let x = 2.9 and use 12e as the example, then there would be<br/>underlining errors of +/- .5, .8, .8, .2, .9, and 3 cents:</p><p> 1.024 /  1.024<br/>35.800 / 33.800<br/> 9.200 /  8.200<br/>37.800 / 31.800<br/>19.400 / 15.400<br/>39.800 / 29.800<br/>10.200 /  7.200</p><p>and rounded errors of +/- 1.05, 3.91, 2.49, 9.24, 1.96, and 17.49<br/>cents:</p><p>5/7, 2/3, 19/30, 19/32, 9/16, 9/17, 1/1, 18/17, 9/8, 19/16, 19/15,<br/>4/3, 10/7</p><p>I&apos;ve also used (LOG(4)-LOG(3))*((7/1)/LOG(2)), or ~2.905 for &quot;x&quot; to<br/>make the minimum deviation from n/e the nearest approximation to 4/3,<br/>i.e., round (LOG(4)-LOG(3))*(e/LOG(2)). Letting x = ~2.905, 13e would<br/>have underlining errors of +/- .6, 1.1, 1.3, 1.1, .5, and .9 cents:</p><p> 1.021 /  1.021<br/>19.384 / 18.384<br/>39.768 / 35.768<br/>20.384 / 17.384<br/>41.768 / 33.768<br/>21.384 / 16.384<br/>43.768 / 31.768<br/>22.384 / 15.384</p><p>and rounded errors of +/- 1.30, 2.21, 4.44, 3.41, 9.24, and 2.53<br/>cents:</p><p>11/16, 21/32, 21/34, 10/17, 5/9, 19/36, 1/1, 19/18, 10/9, 20/17,<br/>21/17, 21/16, 11/8</p><p>INVERSIONAL SYMMETRY...<br/>As the algorithm I&apos;m using here sets &quot;n&quot; as any number =/&gt; 0 and =/&lt;<br/>e/2 there is always inversional symmetry, and all equal numbered EDOs<br/>will always have two ratios representing the half octave (when x =2.9<br/>these are always separated by an underlying 289/288). And in the<br/>rounded examples above you can see that I&apos;ve written them in a fashion<br/>that is analogous to reading this from left to right on a tonality<br/>diamond.</p><p>MUSICAL USEFULNESS...<br/>In looking at this algorithm Dave Keenan also commented that he<br/>thought it was &quot;too accurate,&quot; in other words it gives ratios which<br/>are too complex to be musically significant, and that the whole point<br/>of using ET instead of JI is to make commas disappear and allow the<br/>same equal tempered fraction of an octave to serve more than one<br/>purpose, to function as more than one ratio. And he is of course quite<br/>correct, and I really have nothing to offer in the way of a counter<br/>argument (especially if punning and eradicating commas are your<br/>primary concerns!). But I will say that I personally prefer to let<br/>effective music make its structural components musically useful above<br/>and beyond whatever obvious utility those components are said to<br/>serve. That said, I really do think that most EDOs and their ratio<br/>conversions here would just disappear into each other in a blur of<br/>naturally occurring errors.</p><p>X = 3 AND MUSICAL USEFULNESS REVISITED...<br/>Letting x = 3 and n be any number =/&gt; 0 and =/&lt; e allows one to work<br/>EDOs into a manner of just intonation - a sort of reverse tempering if<br/>you will. Earlier I wrote the rounded examples in a fashion that is<br/>analogous to reading inversional symmetry from left to right on a<br/>tonality diamond, here this would be analogous to reading the diamond<br/>center to right, i.e., the 6/6, 7/5, 8/4, 2e in the following:</p><p>                          1/1<br/>                       1/2   2/1<br/>                    1/3   2/2   3/1<br/>                 1/4   2/3   3/2   4/1<br/>              1/5   2/4   3/3   4/2   5/1<br/>           1/6   2/5   3/4   4/3   5/2   6/1<br/>        1/7   2/6   3/5   4/4   5/3   6/2   7/1<br/>     1/8   2/7   3/6   4/5   5/4   6/3   7/2   8/1<br/>        2/8   3/7   4/6   5/5   6/4   7/3   8/2<br/>           3/8   4/7   5/6   6/5   7/4   8/3<br/>              4/8   5/7   6/6   7/5   8/4<br/>                 5/8   6/7   7/6   8/5<br/>                    6/8   7/7   8/6<br/>                       7/8   8/7<br/>                          8/8</p><p>Changing the EDOs to non-whole number values -- i.e., the stretched<br/>and compressed extremes of what the algorithm will still round to<br/>2/1 -- offers a wealth of possibilities that often times radically<br/>differ from the original EDOs (despite the fact that the amount of<br/>stretching or compressing required is often trivial) or a &quot;classic&quot; JI<br/>to ET (or ET to JI) interpretation.</p><p>For example if e = 12, we get 1/1, 37/35, 19/17, 13/11, 5/4, 41/31,<br/>7/5, 43/29, 11/7, 5/3, 23/13, 47/25, and 2/1, or as it would read<br/>center to right on a (&quot;48-limit&quot;) diamond: 36/36 37/35 38/34 39/33<br/>40/32 41/31 42/30 43/29 44/28 45/27 46/26 47/25 48/24. But say we<br/>stretch the octave by ~1&#xFFFD; by letting e = 11.99, we then get a rounded<br/>ratio conversion of 1/1, 18/17, 19/17, 19/16, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2,<br/>11/7, 22/13, 9/5, 23/12, 2/1. Or using the same ~1&#xFFFD; stretching of 11e,<br/>let e = 10.99 and you then get a rounded conversion of 1/1, 17/16,<br/>17/15, 6/5, 9/7, 19/14, 19/13, 20/13, 5/3, 7/4, 21/11, 2/1.</p><p>Etc., etc.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
