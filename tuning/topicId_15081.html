Not sure how that happened<br/>as I thought I recorded them for Contrabass.)</p><p>N.B. I find one gets a somewhat different perception of pitch for the double base voice on my soundcard.<br/>It&apos;s because of the way the sound fades out, and the effect that one perceives a note as very slightly higher<br/>in pitch if louder for high notes (the other way round for low notes like about A3 or less).</p><p>Somehow one notices this particularly for the Contrabass as it is such a &quot;plain&quot; voice. To my ear, the<br/>sound seems to go noticeably flat towards the end of each note as it fades. The same effect occurs<br/>with violin, but is not so noticeable as the quality of the sound itself grabs ones attention more.</p><p>I wonder if musicians automatically play a bit sharper in actual pitch, in order to preserve the<br/>percieved pitch, as the note fades away? Might be something to suggest to soundcard /<br/>synth manufacturers (or maybe they already do it?)</p><p>That was an easy one to fix - just did a search of the hex dumps for &quot;violin&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s all the vertices + the 35/32 5/4 and 35/32 21/16.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Updated zip.<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/hexany.zip">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/hexany.zip</a> [69 KB]</p><p>On-line .wrl files that use the same midi clips:<br/><a href="http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/hexany.wrl">http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/hexany.wrl</a><br/><a href="http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/hexany_shows_factors.wrl">http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/hexany_shows_factors.wrl</a></p><p>---------------To anyone who is going to look at the on-line files:---------------</p><p>If you have already looked at the earlier version, make sure you exit from all copies of your<br/>browser window, then start it up again, otherwise it may well continue to use the cached<br/>midi clips.</p><p>That mightn&apos;t be enough, you might still get the old versions.</p><p>In fact I actually had to go to<br/>C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files<br/>and do a search for midi clips, order them according to last modified date, and delete all the<br/>ones from the .wrl file, before I could hear the new versions.</p><p>They are pretty obvious - a whole list of things like 5_4_7_4.mid.</p><p>Easy to delete them because they will all be together<br/>in a block of files as they are all downloaded at almost the same time.</p><p>This was for the combination of IE5 + WorldView - maybe it varies, whether you have to do this.</p><p>You may get message to check if you really want to look at your<br/>Temporary Internet Files folder which you need to say Yes to first.</p><p>(I&apos;m not sure, as I have switched off those warnings, as I often need to<br/>look at the system folders etc.)</p><p>Certainly, if you double click on a midi clip in the folder to listen to it, you will get a warning<br/>&quot;Running a system command on this item might be unsafe - do you want to continue - it&apos;s<br/>obviously okay for midi clips, but they seem to make no distinction of file types for the warnings for the<br/>temporary internet files folder.!</p><p>(N.B. you know that thing that sometimes happens, that one sees something really interesting,<br/>and then forget where you saw it? Well you can often find it in this folder. Search for files of type<br/>*.htm, Sort by date, look back a bit, and there it will be, like as not. Now go to the folder itself<br/>and find it there, e.g. using alph. sort, and you will see the url next to it, and can go back to<br/>it by double clicking on the name)</p><p>-----------------end of bit about the on-line files ------------------------</p><p>I&apos;m planning to add an option to FTS to make midi clips for all the notes in a scale, and all its<br/>consonant diads and triads all with a single click (then you just sit back while it plays all the<br/>notes and chords and saves the files). Same for .wav clips.</p><p>It can detect consonant diads by checking if there are any beats less than, say, 20 Hz.</p><p>Will save a great deal of typing and button clicking.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
