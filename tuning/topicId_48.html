I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure it sounds any better than it &quot;should&quot;, however.</p><p>   That was pretty much my impression in my very short investigation of it:<br/>It&apos;s a decent-sounding tuning, but it&apos;s nothing particularly amazing.  That<br/>and the fact that all of Lucy&apos;s pi-related claims - or at least the ones I&apos;ve<br/>heard - strike me as little more than touchie-feelie, &quot;cosmic&quot;,<br/>Chariots-of-the-Gods numerology.</p><p>   For example, the fact that a stack of LucyTuned fifths spirals on forever,<br/>a property he claims is unique to LucyTuning&apos;s pi-based derivation, is<br/>obviously shared by any fifth other than those of equal temperaments.  Now<br/>it&apos;s true that a LucyTuned fifths stack up 88 times before the circle nearly<br/>closes, whereas QC meantone nearly closes after 31, and third-comma nearly<br/>closes at 19 fifths.  But, to give a hypothetical example, a circle of<br/>695.454545-cent fifths (as opposed to his ~695.492966-cent fifth), closes<br/>after 8800 fifths.  Apparently Lucy should regard that fifth as two orders of<br/>magnitude better, and, as far as I can tell, that fifth has nothing<br/>particularly obvious to do with pi.</p><p>   But more importantly, I personally see only so much value in having<br/>unbroken circle of identical-sized fifths.  I see value in it, for example, if<br/>it defines separate Ebs and D#s usable in their appropriate contexts.  But<br/>after you run the circle upward past somewhere around E#, or downward past Bbb<br/>or so, it starts losing meaning.  It&apos;s hard for me to envision any<br/>intuitively-meaningful harmonic relationship between an F### and Gbb.  The<br/>fact that those two pitches are 34 fifths apart is not nearly as intuitively<br/>or audibly meaningful to me as the fact that (in LucyTuning) they are fairly<br/>close to a 13:8 ratio.</p></div>
