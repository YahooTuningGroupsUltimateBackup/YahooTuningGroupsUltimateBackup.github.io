We serve free food afterward.</p><p>Contact: Linda Past<br/>212-564-4899<br/>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>The Composers Concordance will &quot;kick off&quot; it&apos;s new<br/>2002-2003 concert season with a collage of modern composers featuring<br/>many different styles on Wednesday, November 13, 2002, 8PM at the<br/>Washington Square United Methodist Church, 135 W. 4th Street (right<br/>off of 6th Ave.).  Jennifer DeVore and Robert Ekselman will &quot;dig<br/>into&quot; the challenging two cello duo Itinerares written by the well<br/>recognized and very active Swiss composer, Jean Luc Darbellay.<br/>Percussionist Ingrid Gordon will join violinist Anthea Kreston in<br/>David Macbride&apos;s In Common for violin and temple bowls.  This unusual<br/>piece sets off contrasting sonorities between the resonance of bowed<br/>temple bowls (&quot;Eastern&quot; music) and the violin (&quot;Western&quot; music),<br/>setting the stage for meditative, explorations of the commonality of<br/>the two traditions.  It&apos;s definitely an &quot;otherworldly&quot; experience.</p><p>American-Armenian composer Hayg Boyadjian pits the big against the<br/>tiny with his Lumiere Noir for flute and doublebass, played here by<br/>Thea Reynolds, flute and Troy Rinker, doublebass.  Using the<br/>contrasting characters and ranges of the instruments, Boyadjian hurls<br/>material back and forth between these very different instruments.</p><p>The Hunting of the Snark for solo trombone by the internationally<br/>celebrated Norwegian composer Arne Nordheim will use extended<br/>techniques for the instrument combined at times with an etude-like<br/>brilliance for virtuoso trombonist Chris Washburne.</p><p>Violinist Asya Meshberg conjures up the image of a meditative and<br/>explosive wiseman in Dinu Ghezzo&apos;s Il Saggio.  This piece, a tour<br/>de force for the violinist, combines complex, virtuosic abstract<br/>writing with rhythmic materials from folk sources.</p><p>The resonant open strings of the cello will be featured in the<br/>rhapsodic and chromatic Eolica for solo cello by the distinguished<br/>Chilean composer Juan Lemann as performed by cellist Jennifer DeVore.</p><p>Bassist Troy Rinker and flutist Thea Reynolds will essay an early<br/>work by microtonal pioneer Ben Johnston.  In this piece, using a<br/>graphic notation, Johnston indicates microtonal inflections from<br/>standard pitches and consonant intervals, unveiling a far different<br/>compositional esthetic than the serial one prevalent at the time<br/>(1960&apos;s).  In addition, it shows an antecedent for his later<br/>microtonal discoveries and achievements.</p><p>Tickets are $12, $7 students and seniors.  TDF accepted.
