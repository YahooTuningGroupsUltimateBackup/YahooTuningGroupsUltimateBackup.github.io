I am planning on going.  It&apos;s<br/>the debut of the necks I just finished for Catler.  I have a car, and am<br/>willing to carpool or be carpooled.  I am not sure yet where I will be<br/>staying.  Maybe if you have lodging in NYC we could trade for the car ride?<br/>I plan to leave between Noon and 2:PM on Monday, and start the return trip<br/>Tuesday morning.  I can be flexible about this, so long as there is time to<br/>talk before and after the show.</p><p>Any takers?  Anyone else going who would drive me if I pay for gas, tolls,<br/>and overnight parking?</p><p>Please respond off-list so we don&apos;t annoy all the non-New Englanders.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div>
