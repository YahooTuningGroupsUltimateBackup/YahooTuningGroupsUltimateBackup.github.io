I think this has something to do with articulation. While 12-<br/>equal is consistent up to 9-limit, major tetrads don&apos;t quite have<br/>that 7-limit sound. You kind of can&apos;t escape the 5-limit sound in 12-<br/>tet. In 22-equal every interval inside a 7-limit tetrad is<br/>approximated by a different number of 22-equal steps, am I right?

How does this technique relate to<br/>consistency? We know that waveforms are most periodic and have the<br/>clearest pitch when their partials are as close as possible to the<br/>integer multiples of the fundamental but spectral mapping doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily preserve the intervals between partials in consistent<br/>manner.

We know that waveforms are most periodic and have the<br/>&gt; clearest pitch when their partials are as close as possible to the<br/>&gt; integer multiples of the fundamental but spectral mapping doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; necessarily preserve the intervals between partials in consistent<br/>&gt; manner.
