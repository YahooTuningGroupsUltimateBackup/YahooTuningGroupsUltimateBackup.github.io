I&apos;m no expert in this area (far from<br/>it), but I would point out one other interesting article on this<br/>topic:</p><p>&quot;Early Indian Heptatonic Scales and Recent Diatonic Theory&quot; by John<br/>Clough, Jack Douthett, N. Ramanathan, and Lewis Rowell (In Music<br/>Theory Spectrum 15:1, spring 1993, pp.36-58)</p><p>As pointed out by Clough et al, one fascinating aspect of the two<br/>early scales, sa-grama and ma-grama, is that both may be viewed as<br/>second-order maximally even structures.  If we forget about the tuning<br/>argument surrounding Indian scales for the moment and view the sruti<br/>as &quot;abstract chromatic steps,&quot;  we get a rather startling relationship<br/>to diatonic systems.</p><p>The usual major and minor triads are second-order maximally even in<br/>the following sense.  First, as is well known, the white-note scale<br/>C-D-E-F-G-A-B is first-order maximally even with respect to the<br/>12-note abstract chromatic, i.e., the seven notes are &quot;stretched&quot;<br/>(Gk=&quot;diateinein&quot;)<br/>as evenly as possible over the 12, yielding the interval pattern 7\12<br/>= 2212221.  If we then apply the same principle to the diatonic for<br/>selecting three notes in seven, we get 3\7 = 223 (in some rotation).<br/>Combining the two, you get 3\7\12 = 435, a major triad.  Rotate the<br/>original diatonic interval string and you get the other two possible<br/>white note chords, 345 and 336 in the usual places.</p><p>(2)   (2)    (3)          (2)    (2)    (3)          (2)   (2)   (3)<br/>                     (3\7)<br/>22   12   221         21    22   212         12   21   222<br/>         (7\12)<br/>4      3     5             3      4      5            3     3      6<br/>                     (3\7\12)</p><p>White-note seventh chords are likewise second order maximally even<br/>(4\7\12)</p><p>Now look at the maximally even 12\22 = any rotation of the basic<br/>pattern 222221222221.  Apply the same principle as above and you get a<br/>variety of second-order maximally even scales, two of which are:</p><p>sa grama,</p><p>     2     1     2       2        2     1      2<br/>      (7\12)</p><p>    2 1   2    2 2    2 2    1 2    2    2 2<br/> (12\22)</p><p>     3     2     4        4       3     2     4<br/>      (7\12\22)</p><p>and ma grama</p><p>     2     1     2       2        2     1      2<br/>      (7\12)</p><p>    1 2   2    2 2    2 1     2 2   2     2 2<br/> (12\22)</p><p>      3    2     4       3        4     2      4<br/>      (7\12\22)</p><p>There is much more in the article I cited, and any misleading<br/>statements anyone feels I am making here regarding this phenomenon<br/>should be placed at my feet, not those of the authors of the Spectrum<br/>article.</p><p>Steve Soderberg</p></div><h3><a id=16912 href="#16912">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

There are at least two<br/>problems with this interpretation as far as I can see. First, the genesis of<br/>the numbers 7, 12, and 22 is left totally unexplained. Second, the Modern<br/>Indian Gamut, a set of 12 from 22 which supports the ma- and sa- gramas and<br/>their standard alterations, is not a rotation of the pattern 222221222221<br/>but instead 222212222221 (as usual, tetrachordality appears more important<br/>than maximal evenness). On the other hand, I was able to come up with a<br/>different definition of second-order maximal evenness, which results _only_<br/>in the ma- and sa- gramas and their standard alterations, while Clough and<br/>Douthett need to supplement their definition of second-order maximal<br/>evenness with a requirement that there be only one tritone (interval of 11<br/>srutis) in order to get only the ma- and sa- gramas and their standard<br/>alterations.</p></div>
