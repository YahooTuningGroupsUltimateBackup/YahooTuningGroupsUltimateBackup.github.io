I forgot about this site, although I had been there before.  I had no<br/>idea that all the old tuning list posts about the Partch &quot;controversy&quot; were<br/>up there.  I can understand why the list doesn&apos;t want to &quot;rehash&quot;...  I was<br/>especially taken by the fact that arguments both pro and CON regarding the<br/>Partch performance options were on the site.  Most impressive for<br/>background.  Thank you.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
