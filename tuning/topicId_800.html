Octave invariance is never complete no<br/>&gt;matter how low the limit...</p><p>I agree.  I do think there may be some uneveness in the curve when you<br/>cross over to 9, since for the first time the basic chords insist on spanning<br/>more than an octave in every voicing...</p><p>&gt;At the 7-limit, it is certainly true that 7:5 is more consonant than<br/>&gt;10:7 and chords that include the former are perceived as more stable<br/>&gt;than those that include the latter. Even in 22-tET where these intervals<br/>&gt;are both represented by a half-octave, chords where the half-octave<br/>&gt;represents a 7:5 tend to sound a good deal more stable than those where the<br/>half-octave represents a 10:7.</p><p>Could you give an example or two?</p><p>&gt;In most contexts, 7:6 is quite a bit more consonant than 12:7.</p><p>I think I can agree with that.</p><p>&gt;Even in 12-tET, a minor sixth alone can be heard as a dissonance,<br/>&gt;in sharp contrast to a major third. Triadic harmony will tend to<br/>&gt;clarify the meaning of the minor sixth to the point where it can<br/>&gt;no longer be considered dissonant.</p><p>Gee, I don&apos;t know about this one...  Harmonizing a melody with sixths, for<br/>example?</p><p>Carl</p></div>
