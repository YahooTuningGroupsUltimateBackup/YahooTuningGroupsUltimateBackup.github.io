I could recognise them easily at, say,<br/>concert pitch A, but transpose up say 20 cents, and I could no longer<br/>distinguish them at all.</p><p>FTS does random transpositions, and I find at some transpositions I know<br/>instantly which it is, and at others, I have no idea at all!</p><p>After a while, one learns them in a new transposition, and though one<br/>can&apos;t remember them as such, yet later in the day it is still possible<br/>to distinguish them in the new transposition.</p><p>Add a few more notes to make them into a major or minor melody and once<br/>more I could distinguish one from the other at any transposition.</p><p>But for single interval, had to go to even wider intervals. Testing melodic<br/>sequences, I ended up trying 16/15 and 3/2. Even then, got them confused in<br/>a few rare transpositions first time I tried it!</p><p>Obviously the times before when I was distinguishing really close<br/>intervals, it was on the basis of absolute rather than relative pitch.</p><p>So, I&apos;ve been practising it, and gradually getting better. I&apos;ve been doing<br/>it by working inwards from the most closely separated interval I can<br/>reliably distinguish. Yesterday, for the first time, could distinguish 9/8<br/>and 4/3 as melodic sequences at any transposition! Today I seem to<br/>be  well on the way to distinguish 6/5 and 3/2 at any transposition, but<br/>haven&apos;t yet got it quite.</p><p>It is rather exciting! Probably won&apos;t be that long to reach 6/5 and 5/4, I hope!<br/>(Funny thing is, would never sing a 4/3 for a 9/8, at least, I think not!)</p><p>Remember, I&apos;m an amateur, and haven&apos;t had anyone getting at me to use<br/>relative rather than absolute pitch.</p><p>Also tried singing a familiar tune on my own, then immediately transposing<br/>it up by a fraction of a semitone - it was really hard, needing a _lot_ of<br/>concentration. I don&apos;t notice that when singing with others as I seem to be<br/>able to follow at octave interval, presumably using interval sense there.</p><p>I don&apos;t have colour synthesia - absolute pitch sounds more like an<br/>instrument timbre to me. Also it is rather jumbled up with some close<br/>together notes sounding far apart in pitch timbre, and some far apart notes<br/>sounding similar. Also not able to name notes that I hear - it is somewhat<br/>untrained.</p><p>To explain it a bit to those who rely mainly on relative pitch, I tend to<br/>hear an isolated chord as two pitch timbres sounding together. A bit like<br/>hearing a flute and a violin playing in unison - is that closer or further<br/>apart than a tuba playing with a bassoon? The pitch timbre almost<br/>completely overwhelms the much weaker sense of relative pitch in an<br/>isolated interval.</p><p>Yet the interval sense is clearly there in larger passages, just that it is<br/>hard to pinpoint it in a single interval taken in isolation. I appreciate<br/>the wide variety of scales, and love JdLs adaptive re-tunings of music,<br/>which makes a tremendous difference to my ear.</p><p>I wonder if anyone else on the list has had similar experiences. I&apos;m also<br/>interested to hear how musicians get on who become involved in microtonal<br/>music and who have a strong sense of absolute pitch beforehand. Do they<br/>learn to make the tiny distinctions between sizes of intervals at arbitrary<br/>transpositions, and is it just a matter of time and application to learn to<br/>do so?</p><p>I&apos;d sometimes wondered before if I had absolute pitch, but since I couldn&apos;t<br/>name notes I hear, or sing a named note, thought perhaps not (except that<br/>when learning the cello there were times when I used to be able to sing the<br/>tuning fork A when I wished, remembering it at least from one day to the<br/>next, so that prob. is an absolute pitch thing).</p><p>Here is a page about difficulties some people have because of absolute<br/>pitch, including, inability to hear intervals easily at first.<br/><a href="http://shrike.depaul.edu/~abreeden/prime.htm">http://shrike.depaul.edu/~abreeden/prime.htm</a></p><p>There is some evidence that absolute pitch can be learnt, and is a<br/>disposition we all have to some extent. It is rare for many language users,<br/>but may be common for language users who rely on pitch to convey meaning<br/>(e.g., Chinese or Vietmanese).<br/>See Speaking in Tones (Scientific American 1999)<br/><a href="http://www.sciam.com/exhibit/1999/110199pitch/">http://www.sciam.com/exhibit/1999/110199pitch/</a></p><p>They measured the pitch used for a word on subsequent days, and found the<br/>pitch accurate to within a few cents, close enough to suggest absolute<br/>pitch.</p><p>I wonder if this is related to earlier remarks on the TL about Chinese<br/>music, and their tendency not to use intervals language to describe it?</p><p>I&apos;ve also been reading Shepard&apos;s original article on Shepard tones (j. of<br/>Acoustical soc. of Am, v38 number 12 1964). He wanted to check out how his<br/>new endlessly ascending scales were heard. So he tested 50 employees of<br/>Bell laboratories, where he worked. As a preliminary test, since his<br/>example scale consisted ascending semitiones, he needed to know which of<br/>the group could distinguish a step of a semitone in pitch, knowing in<br/>advance that some listeners to music can&apos;t.</p><p>He was astonished to find only 62 percent could always tell which way is up<br/>of two notes a semitone apart selected from<br/>the octave starting at E4 flat (311 Hz). For quiet notes played two octaves<br/>lower, only 30 percent got all the pairs of notes right.</p><p>However their description of what was happening varied. Some couldn&apos;t hear<br/>any difference in pitch at all, or with great difficulty. Others could hear<br/>a difference, but didn&apos;t always know which way was up of the two notes.<br/>Some, given more time to sing the notes to compare them, were then able to<br/>tell the direction of the difference. He suggested this may be similar to<br/>the confusion some have of left with right, or with the confusion that (he<br/>says) unpracticed subjects have with the order of the dots and dashes<br/>heard when transcribing fast Morse code.</p><p>I remember well that when learning the &apos;cello, at the beginning it took a<br/>fair while to learn which way to turn the tuning knob for the A string to<br/>get to the pitch of the tuning fork. It was exactly the experienced<br/>described. I could hear the notes were different, but couldn&apos;t tell which<br/>way was up.</p><p>I also had lots of problems trying to sing the same note as someone else as<br/>a child, and was regarded as someone who couldn&apos;t sing in tune (and took<br/>art instead of music at school - maybe it wouldn&apos;t be the same today when<br/>there is more emphasis on teaching everyone to sing I believe).</p><p>Combining Shepard&apos;s observations with the numbers of Chinese and Vietnamese<br/>who seemed to have a sense of absolute pitch in their ordinary speaking<br/>voice, I wonder (purely as speculation of course) if a strong sense of<br/>absolute pitch, in an unanalysed form, may be present in more people than<br/>one realises, and that it may get trained out of us because of the strong<br/>emphasis on interval relationships in our &quot;Western&quot; (anyone know a better<br/>term) music?</p><p>Nowadays, I do at least always know which way is up of any two notes that I<br/>can distinguish in pitch, no matter how close, so one can learn that with<br/>time. And hopefully, now that my attention has been drawn to it should be<br/>able to gradually develop a better sense of relative pitch for intervals<br/>heard in isolation, since there is strong evidence that the interval sense<br/>is there somewhere, and quite finely tuned too probably.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=16770 href="#16770">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2000 6:19:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16758">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16758</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve added a Random chord quiz button to FTS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is about the new release that unfortunately I&apos;ve had to<br/>withdraw because of the bug - if curious to see it anyway (Joseph&apos;s<br/>crash reports are the only ones I&apos;ve ever had since release of<br/>Fractal<br/>Melody in 1999, so you may find it works fine, as it does here)</p><p>I&apos;m really VERY sorry about this, and I&apos;m willing to concede that<br/>maybe my computer system is a little strange... but, regardless, the<br/>bug prevents me from using the Smithy and I am under the assumption<br/>that, if it happens to me  (there is nothing very outre about my<br/>setup) it could well happen to others!</p><p>I will send a &quot;bug&quot; report this evening, and hopefully we can<br/>exterminate the bug...</p><p>_________ ______ ___ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=16772 href="#16772">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2000 7:05:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16758">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16758</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried 5/4 and 6/5 to start with, thinking that would be easy and<br/>I&apos;d go to something trickier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, was astonished to find that I couldn&apos;t do it, not for an<br/>isolated interval completely out of context.

It&apos;s particularly<br/>interesting in a Setherian sense since, apparently, you are fixating<br/>on harmonics to the detriment of intervallic assessment. It would be<br/>interesting to know how you perceive a music where the<br/>intervallic construction IS parallel to the timbral fabric... some of<br/>the stuff Setheres is working with...</p><p>By the way, there are computer programs out there that can improve<br/>relative pitch recognition.  I even had one years ago with a<br/>Commodore 64, back when the IBM computers cost $3,000...  Sometimes,<br/>for me, I had trouble distinguishing intervals accurately without<br/>transposing octaves...  to determine accurately, for instance, that<br/>what I was hearing was a major sixth, and not a minor one,<br/>(totally out of any context) sometimes I had to sing them and<br/>determine the MINOR THIRD relationship BELOW... and then correctly<br/>determine the interval as a MAJOR sixth!</p><p>The program not only gave random intervals, but it assessed the<br/>&quot;progress&quot; or grade of the listener.  It really was fun, and improved<br/>&quot;ear training&quot; greatly.</p><p>The &quot;pre-eminent&quot; computer ear-training system I have encountered was<br/>MAINFRAME-based at the University of Delaware.
