Carbon fiber<br/>soundboard instead of wood, tuning machine instead of pins/pinblock, 5 or 6<br/>octaves instead of 8, single and double stringing instead of triple,<br/>generalized keyboard instead of halberstadt, 19 and 31 tones per octave<br/>instead of 12...</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=1151 href="#1151">ðŸ”—</a>bram &#x3C;bram@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/1999 6:36:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 2 Mar 1999, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; Why not improve the piano rather than sending it to the farm?</p><p>Because a good synth is a lot cheaper than a cheap piano.</p><p>-Bram</p></div><h3><a id=1173 href="#1173">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Bela Fleck and the Flecktones</p><p>In what sense is this a rock group? Top-of-the-line, yes; popular, very;<br/>rock, I think not.<br/>Do you think Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood is a rock group? They&apos;re really good<br/>too (my friend Bob Moses was their teacher!)<br/>Fans of these two bands are very numerous and tend to listen to very<br/>little rock music.</p><p>&gt;2. Ozric Tentacles</p><p>They don&apos;t _suck_, but I sure get tired of them very quickly.</p><p>&gt;3. Phish</p><p>They push the envelope _and_ bring it home! Probably more people have<br/>heard 20th-century techniques because of Phish than through the efforts<br/>of any other musician or group (including Boulez). Don&apos;t buy a CD -- see<br/>them live.</p><p>Any of these three groups would no doubt make marvelous use of<br/>microtonal scales.</p></div>
