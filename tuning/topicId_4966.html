Given the right<br/>register, one can hear several orders of difference tones and the chords lock<br/>quickly into place, with an accuracy of much greater than one percent.</p><p>-----As Sethares makes clear, the optimal timbre for both harmonic and<br/>subharmonic chords is a harmonic one.  (Labeling something &apos;harmonic&apos; or<br/>&apos;subharmonic&apos; is essentially a matter of convention, since all just chords<br/>can be notated either way; a convention that makes sense is to label a given<br/>chord &apos;harmonic&apos; when the numerators are smaller than the denominators when<br/>notated subharmonically. Ambiguous chords can be labeled according to their<br/>funtional context.)<br/>One point of view, and probably a controversial one at that, holds sine waves<br/>to be what I&apos;ll call a &quot;minimal harmonic timbre&quot;, and as such will be the<br/>minimal optimal timbre for both harmonic and subharmonic chords.</p><p>-----I find sine waves to be especially useful in that the masking of<br/>individual voices by partial tones is eliminated, although difference tones<br/>may create masking of their own.  (Lou Harrison has had considerable problems<br/>with false gong tones created by difference tones between his just<br/>metallophones).  This is a real problem in both orchestration and synthesis.</p><p>-----In einer Nachricht vom 9/20/99 10:02:53 PM (MEZ) - Mitteleurop.<br/>Sommerzeschreibt <a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>:</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> &gt;I would guess that the bodies of the horns will<br/> &gt;resonate with their own harmonics, at least.</p><p> Remember, the resonant frequencies of the horn can only determine selective<br/> amplification characteristics -- they won&apos;t add new harmonic content to the<br/> signal (except in transients). &gt;&gt;</p><p>If there is enough noise in the signal, the speaker&apos;s own resonances can be<br/>activated.  This is similar to the situation with resonated idiophones. I&apos;ve<br/>found most commercial synthesizers to be practically unusable due to the<br/>combination of high noise content with the low tuning accuracy. The<br/>double-precision Rayna synth I use for installations is customized -- as are<br/>La Monte Young&apos;s -- with a good low pass filter to cut out most of the<br/>unwanted noise.  A major limitation with the Rayna is that it only has four<br/>channels of output, although I may use up to 59 voices. The distributions of<br/>the individual voices over the four channels is sensitive, as is the size and<br/>placement of the louspeakers in the room.  With some thick chords, lacking<br/>the ability to send each oscillator out on its own channel, the optimal<br/>solution may sometimes be to send it all out, mono, over a single<br/>loudspeaker.  (Is it any wonder that La Monte Young spends all his spare<br/>change on good loudspeakers?).</p><p>----- Finally, regarding Darren Burgess&apos;s carillon project.  I understand<br/>that you have decided, for practical reasons, not to fine tune the 2nd and<br/>3rd modes.  But I don&apos;t understand how you will eliminate the (untuned) modes<br/>without use of a filter or mute of some sort.  above and beyond the issue of<br/>loudspeakers, the idea of getting a sine wave out of a struck rod sounds a<br/>bit strange, perhaps you meant only to say that the just intervals would be<br/>between the fundamentals?  Even if you do filter out the upper partials,<br/>wouldn&apos;t you end up with something that sounds not at all like a carillon?</p></div>
