Numbers are definitely a force in the<br/>&gt; &quot;unconscious&quot;.  I think this is so deep that I never even considered trying<br/>&gt; to approach this consciously as it might relate to pitch and interval<br/>&gt; sensibilities, and I don&apos;t know how it relates to the &quot;forces&quot; that I feel.<br/>&gt; I think the forces that I feel are somehow very related to the body, to what<br/>&gt; I experience as the space inside the body and how it by being present here<br/>&gt; the space inside me is resonating with the things I am considering in a<br/>&gt; &quot;bodily&quot; way (not just in a cognitive way), which is how music has to be for<br/>&gt; me, though I usually don&apos;t talk too much about this.  Its not that I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; _extremely_ cognitive, but by and large the cognitive in spite of its<br/>&gt; complexity and vastness, is just a reflection of something even more vast<br/>&gt; and beyond understanding.  Even the body itself which is very &quot;finite&quot; is<br/>&gt; also rather infinite if looked at from the inside.  The capacities for<br/>&gt; assimilation of forms, &quot;resonances&quot;, bodily &quot;reflection&quot;, and various things<br/>&gt; which we consider &quot;cognitive&quot; have a lot of depth that goes beyond what we<br/>&gt; can understand consciously.  Little do we know what we are doing when we say<br/>&gt; we are &quot;thinking&quot; and many people mean something very different by the same<br/>&gt; word.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So as regards primes, I think the aspect of existence we call &quot;number&quot; goes<br/>&gt; very deep in experience.  I started to write a little about this, but it got<br/>&gt; way too long, and I&apos;m not sure of its relevance.  I feel like I&apos;ve already<br/>&gt; written enough longish things that tend to be off-topic-ish lately.  So I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; send it too you (monz) directly, off-list, and if anybody else wants an<br/>&gt; experiential reflection on &quot;number&quot; that is sort of half-baked, let me know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But tell me:  what is the particular connection you are seeing that led you<br/>&gt; to respond?  I had mentioned &quot;forces&quot; and so forth, but I&apos;m not sure which<br/>&gt; thing you were picking up on.  I think maybe you are talking about the<br/>&gt; possible connection between the experience of reconciling different forces<br/>&gt; musically and some numerical linguistic level which somehow may underlying<br/>&gt; the experience of pitch relationships, that the &quot;forces&quot; are the force of an<br/>&gt; underlying language, perhaps an experirence of bumping into the &quot;structures&quot;<br/>&gt; inherent in that space of relationships.  Is that something like what you<br/>&gt; are saying?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Kurt</p><p>You are wrong Kurt ! This is not interestingÂŠ but much, much interesting. In<br/>my way of thinking, that is fundamental ! Consciousness is not enough to<br/>define an human being (living beingÂŠ). Just like ratios are not enough to<br/>define musicÂŠ<br/>I had a good experiment with a group about ten years ago during a little<br/>more than 3 years. The experiment was based on &quot;resonance corporeal&quot; and it<br/>was postulate that the harmonic scale is integrated in us.</p><p>I win a lot in this experience, in music practice but not only, like<br/>something close to eloquence, but not exactly. Anyway very useful for<br/>teachingÂŠ<br/>With my so poor english, I will no try to said much about this, only few<br/>things :<br/>One point I clearly experiment was that the body resound mostly to any<br/>sound. And this is quite more important, EVEN FOR THE UNDERSTANDING, than<br/>the meaning of the sound (for example the meaning of the words) !<br/>There is a way to speak, in front of people, to be understand, like way to<br/>be not. And the choice of the words doesn&apos;t matter so much in this.<br/>A second point was that every one is particular. For me one point was that<br/>some place in my body didn&apos;t resound at all. Just like died place.<br/>A third point was that you can, with practice, really and with much<br/>accuracy, feel if the people in front of you resound or not and work on it.<br/>Even unconsciously that work with more and more practice, you don&apos;t have to<br/>manage, it just happen.<br/>And with much more practice, some one can tell you where you don&apos;t resound<br/>when he is speaking (it looks to be close that you call reflection). I had<br/>experiment of this in front the teacher. Quite incredible that he can tell<br/>me, better than I could, where it looks died !<br/>People there was musicians, teachers, &quot;therapeuthes&quot;.</p><p>Can you send me off list, if you please Kurt, that you already wrote. My<br/>intuition tell me that you point something of great interest for me.<br/>Also, is it really funny, that you are the one of only two who took a time<br/>to respond to me when I asked for people experienceÂŠ But, true, we spoke,<br/>not about scientist music but about human artÂŠ</p><p>Thanks Kurt,</p><p>Gilles Patrat</p></div>
