So you can import one tuning, load an instrument in one channel, import a different tuning, load an instrument in another channel, and switch tunings that way.

For example, if I want to<br/>&gt; play middle C raised by 30 cent, then I send a CC event for tuning<br/>&gt; the pitch class C up by 30 cent and then, at the same time, the<br/>&gt; middle C note. I use 12 different CC events (CC 100-111) and<br/>&gt; interpret the CC value as transposition in cent (e.g., CC 101 with<br/>&gt; value 64+30 tunes all C# up by 30 cent, value 64 means 0 cent<br/>&gt; detuning).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only limitation of this approach is that I cannot play chords<br/>&gt; with more than 12 individually tuned pitches on a single MIDI<br/>&gt; channel (there could of course by octave transpositions). My actual<br/>&gt; implementation additionally has the restriction that there can be<br/>&gt; only 2 pitches at maximum within a range of 100 cent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This retuning is defined by a Kontakt script that is controlled by<br/>&gt; MIDI messages. Because you can pretty freely program how certain<br/>&gt; MIDI events affect the tuning, you could also realise your example<br/>&gt; scenario. I based my approach on an existing script that also&gt; supports changing the tuning by selecting some existing or user<br/>&gt; defined tuning from a menu. I did not try this, but I am pretty sure<br/>&gt; you could control this selection by MIDI events.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are interested, I can send you my Kontakt script (no idea<br/>&gt; whether Kontakt player supports scripts as well or whether that is<br/>&gt; only support by the full version of Kontakt). I would have attached<br/>&gt; it already, only I don&apos;t have Kontakt with me in the office..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best<br/>&gt; Torsten<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 24 Aug 2009, at 14:05, Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Dear Torsten,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Am I correct in assuming that you can switch from, say, Pietro Aron&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; 1/4 comma meantone temperament to 12-tone Pythagorean tuning during<br/>&gt;&gt; playback of a, say, Sibelius score via a very high or low midi note<br/>&gt;&gt; (which can be hidden in the score later) within an instrument<br/>&gt;&gt; channel?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I have at hand Sibelius 5 with Kontakt Player 2 installed.

E.g., I am doing music in 31 ET<br/>&gt;&gt; or adaptive JI. Therefore I am using a different approach: I fine-<br/>&gt;&gt; tune individual notes. More specifically, for each note I am<br/>&gt;&gt; retuning the playback of its pitch class by CC events. For<br/>&gt;&gt; example, if I want to play middle C raised by 30 cent, then I send<br/>&gt;&gt; a CC event for tuning the pitch class C up by 30 cent and then, at<br/>&gt;&gt; the same time, the middle C note.
