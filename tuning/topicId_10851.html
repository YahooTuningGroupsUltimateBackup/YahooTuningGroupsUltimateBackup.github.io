I believe this is because the hellacious checksum bit that needs to<br/>be calculated and added to the data of sysex files.  Once you send a tuning<br/>to the &apos;z you should be able to upload it to cakewalk or a simple sysex dump<br/>program.  This way, you could create a library of sysex tuning files.  The<br/>&apos;z should accept sysex tuning dumps in this way.</p><p>Good luck and please let me know if it works.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>Gainesville FL<br/><a href="mailto:dburgess@acceleration.net">dburgess@acceleration.net</a></p><p>&gt; I have a question about Scala. I&apos;ve recently downloaded the most current<br/>version - 1.6. I am able to use it for analysis, but have been unable to get<br/>it to recognize my USB midi port, so that I can transmit the midi to my<br/>keyboard - which is supported - the venerable TX81Z. Looks like the 2 midi<br/>programs included, do not recognize this kind of port. I also tried to get<br/>it to create a .MID file to send with my sequencer - Cake Walk 9.0. Couldn&apos;t<br/>get it to work either. Do you know if Scala can &quot;Send/File&quot; as a Sysx<br/>format? Perhaps this is what the synth would like to have.</p></div>
