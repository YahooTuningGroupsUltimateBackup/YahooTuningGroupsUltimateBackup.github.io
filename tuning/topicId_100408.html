The average string player doesn&apos;t play a 400 cent major third, and you experience no difficulty getting them to play what you&apos;d like them to play, and yet you are upset over what they<br/>&quot;know&quot;, which is apparently merely definitional. &quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that argument is rather straw-man-like as compared to what Steve appears to be saying.&nbsp; Of course a good string player can FIND the major third by ear.&nbsp; That is not a show/proof of strength of the Cent measurement...it&apos;s a show/proof that string instrument players have good tuning ears. :-D</p><p>&nbsp; However, the question is can a musician, after being told what a cent is, quickly figure out the major third JUST by looking at the cent value IE without hearing it?</p><p>&nbsp; The most natural thing to do first is try simple multiples of cents IE 400 cents and then subtract a bit from it...since they know a Just major third is flat of a 12TET major third.&nbsp; But how much to subtract?&nbsp; There is virtually no numerical pattern that says 386 cents is more likely to be selected in such a process than, say, 395 cents or 370 cents.</p><p>&nbsp; Now let&apos;s say that same person guessed using 31TET value and found 1000 31TET &quot;cents&quot; (the 10th step of 31TET) as the answer.&nbsp; That&apos;s within about a 12TET<br/> cent of the perfect answer...and finding it takes about as long as it takes to count to 10 (100,200,300,400,500....1000).<br/>&nbsp; Not to mention 1000 for a major third and 800 for a minor third...is much easier to memorize than 386 for a major third and 315 for a minor third (where&apos;s the easily memorizable numeric pattern there...it seems obvious to me there IS none!)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you could do the same with 72TET, but then you get something like 2300 72TET &quot;cents&quot; (counting to 23) before you hit the major third.&nbsp; And, to note, 2300 can not be divided by 6 to get the 12EDO equivalent...only 2400 can...and with 2400 you get, guess what...the same problem of the 14 cent off just error you get with 12TET.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But you know what?&nbsp; Cents are so highly used within instruments and software...there are sadly probably very few people willing to make the jump to get a system that&apos;s easier to see patterns in and to<br/> memorize steps with minimal errors to Just intervals (again...how many people who know cents can correctly guess/figure-out how many cents flat of a 400 12TET cent major third and Just major third is given only the information that 100 cents = 1 semitone?...I dare anyone to try that question on a non-microtonal musician off-list).</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
