I have therefore deleted the graphic and have replaced it<br/>with an updated version, in which:</p><p>1) The symbols shown on the keytops are now the latest version (sized<br/>for staff lines 6 pixels apart, identical to the sagittal graphics in<br/>Scala 2.2);<br/>2) There is a full sequence of sagittal symbols for 72-ET at the<br/>bottom (in a larger size, for staff lines 8 pixels apart);<br/>3) The key colors can be more easily identified if the figure is<br/>printed in black and white.</p><p>As Dave Keenan also explained in msg. #47451, these symbols are for<br/>the &quot;pure&quot; version of the sagittal notation, which eliminates<br/>conventional sharp and flat (single and double) symbols, thus<br/>requiring only a single symbol for each notehead.  This results in a<br/>relatively uncluttered appearance for notating chords on a<br/>manuscript, something that can be a problem with a notation that<br/>requires multiple symbols for each notehead.</p><p>Since Sibelius will not presently handle the number of new symbols<br/>for 72-ET required with the pure version of sagittal, Joseph will<br/>have to use the &quot;mixed&quot; version of the notation, which uses single-<br/>shaft sagittal symbols in combination with conventional sharp and<br/>flat symbols.  Since the mixed version uses fewer new symbols, it has<br/>a gentler learning curve, and clutter is not an issue for parts<br/>written for instruments that play only one note at a time.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=47467 href="#47467">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

The article that contains this figure will have a blow-by-<br/>blow explanation of what the symbols mean, but you should be able to<br/>figure out a lot of this (i.e., the symbols for 80:81, 63:64, 32:33,<br/>and 26:27) from the ratios.  Here&apos;s a tip:  For symbols containing<br/>straight-line half-arrowheads (or &quot;barbs&quot;, which appear in the 1st,<br/>2nd, and 4th chords), pay particular attention to the *slope* of the<br/>barbs, which is an indication of the direction of the 5-comma (80:81)<br/>alteration to that note (in both the pure and mixed-symbol<br/>versions).

In fact, you could also have a 224-<br/>ET variant based on a 224-ET mapping (which is closer to the athenian<br/>version, since the fifth of 224 has less error than in 217).  While<br/>all 3 of these divide the apotome into 21 parts and the 5-comma into<br/>4 parts, the two ETs differ in the number of degrees in a limma<br/>(diatonic semitone) and pythagorean whole tone, and all 3 use a<br/>slightly different sequence of symbols:</p><p>JI:  |(  )|(  ~|(  /|  |)  (|  (|(  //|  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\<br/>  )||(  ~||(  )||~  ||)  ||\  (||(  //||  /||)  /||\<br/>224:  |(  )|(  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|(  //|  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\<br/>  )||(  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\  (||(  //||  /||)  /||\<br/>217:  |(  ~|  ~|(  /|  |)  |\  (|(  //|  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\<br/>  )||(  ~||(  /||  ||)  ||\  (||(  ||~)  /||)  /||\</p><p>The single-shaft symbols differ only in the symbols for 2 and 6<br/>degrees (and therefore also for their double-shaft apotome<br/>complements, 15 and 19deg).  These symbols have the following primary<br/>comma meanings:</p><p>~|   17 kleisma, 2176:2187, ~8.730c<br/>)|(  7:11 kleisma, 891:896, ~9.688c<br/> |\  55 comma, 54:55, ~31.767c<br/>(|   7:11 comma, 45056:45927, ~33.148c</p><p>The reason for the variation in symbols between 217 and 224 is due to<br/>the fact that ~| is valid as 2deg217 but as 1deg224, while )|( is<br/>1deg217 but 2deg224.  The athenian JI symbol set could theoretically<br/>use either symbol in either pair, but )|( and (| were chosen because<br/>they are more useful for JI in that they both exactly notate 11-limit<br/>consonances (11/7 and 14/11, in alternate spellings), so that 14/11<br/>may be spelled as either E)|( --  a pythagorean E raised by 891:896,<br/>or Fb(|  --   a pythagorean F-flat raised by 45056:45927.</p><p>Athenian is our name for the sagittal symbol set that notates medium-<br/>precision JI.  We call our &quot;bare-bones&quot; or &quot;starter&quot; symbol<br/>set &quot;spartan&quot;; it&apos;s capable of notating 7-limit consonances and 16<br/>harmonics in JI, plus most of the more popular ETs under 100, and a<br/>lot of folks might not need anything more than that.  We thought<br/>that, since we were naming one symbol set after Sparta, we should<br/>also honor the other pre-eminent ancient Greek city-state with a<br/>symbol set name.</p><p>We have 2 or 3 other JI symbols sets still to be finalized (all<br/>higher-precision than athenian) that, since they contain both pairs<br/>of symbols, are able to distinguish between the above pairs of<br/>commas.  Athenian JI does not make the distinction of the 5-schisma<br/>(~1.954c), but the higher-precision symbol sets do.  The choice of<br/>which particular set to use will come down to a trade-off between<br/>simplicity and precision.</p><p>&gt; it seems to me that my &quot;Adaptive-JI&quot; Dictionary page<br/>&gt; could illustrate both approaches to adaptive-JI, no?</p><p>Yes, it could, and the 224 approach could also be included.  The 224<br/>symbol set is easier to remember in the pure sagittal version,<br/>because the entire sequence of double-shaft symbols has flags that<br/>match a portion of the single-shaft symbol sequence.  Athenian JI<br/>notation in the pure sagittal version would also be simpler if the<br/>224 symbol set were used, but this would be at the expense of<br/>substituting an inexact symbol |\ for an exact one (| for the 7:11<br/>comma, and in deciding that (| should be in the athenian set we chose<br/>precision over simplicity.</p><p>&gt; ... and if i *can* keep the 217edo example, how does<br/>&gt; sagittal notation now fit into that?</p><p>The figure that you have is still valid, since the 217-ET notation<br/>depicted therein has not changed, but as a 217 mapping it must be<br/>identified as based on a specific ET.  It&apos;s a couple of steps removed<br/>from athenian adaptive JI (with a 224 mapping being one step<br/>removed).  You could note, however, that the 217 approach might be a<br/>bit more practical with acoustic instruments, since flexible-pitch<br/>instruments specially built for 31-ET could be employed to bend tones<br/>by +-3 degrees of 217 (in steps of ~5.5c with a max. alteration &lt;17<br/>cents) to produce any pitch of 217-ET.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=47481 href="#47481">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2003 2:27:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; hi George,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
