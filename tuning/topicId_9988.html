What is the<br/>&gt; &gt;history of this concept?? Paul?? Anybody??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My understanding was that the idea dated back 200 years but was still<br/>&gt; controversial. I could be totally mistaken.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;In any case, the theory seems new and Helmholtz is looking for examples<br/>&gt; &gt;to back it up.  He unfortunately wanders into the realm of taste... or<br/>&gt; &gt;is it tastelessness (??)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;[snip]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;(Some of this makes our short-lived &quot;Mark C.&quot; interchanges maybe not<br/>&gt; &gt;quite so weird after all!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph...you must be joking.</p><p>Yes Paul, exaggerating, of course.</p><p>But you have to admit that Helmholtz&apos;s attempt to tie the Fourier<br/>analysis in with compound sense of taste is a pretty specious<br/>argument!... (Not complaining about Helmholtz, of course, just<br/>observing)</p><p>I think this has all led to some very interesting conversation.  Dante<br/>Rosati made some interesting observations regarding the perception of<br/>the overtone series in a vibrating string (stopped partial by partial!)<br/>which, of course, goes back a long way.</p><p>It is, however Paul, your own FUSION comments that interest me.  Was it<br/>Mersenne who first considered the notion of timbre as, basically, a<br/>&quot;piling up&quot; of partials?</p><p>And one final question... how is Fourier analysis actually<br/>accomplished?? Can computer programs separate out the partials??  It&apos;s<br/>easy to understand how to BUILD UP timbre in a synthesizer patch<br/>editor... keep adding the partials, and it&apos;s all there.  We can,<br/>nowadays, do that easily right &quot;at home.&quot;</p><p>But how about in a &quot;natural&quot; sound.  How do people find the partials<br/>then??  Can computer programs easily do this now??  How does the EAR do<br/>it??</p><p>And, finally, how did Fourier HIMSELF do it??... if he was back at the<br/>beginning of the 19th century.  Questions, questions.</p><p>Any help on any of this from sysop Paul or any other cats would be<br/>greatly appreciated... It will make my Helmholtz reading more<br/>enjoyable.
