Given 5L2s, you know the period is an octave, since 2 and 5 are relatively prime. Then its parent is 2L3s, and its children are 7L5s and 5L7s. Now we can go on to grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The children of 7L5s, the 12-note meantone MOS, are 12L7s, the septimal meantone range, and 7L12s, the flattone range. The children of 5L7s are 12L5s and 5L12s. And so forth.</p></div>
