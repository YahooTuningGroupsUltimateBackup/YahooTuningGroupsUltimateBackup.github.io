My musical life<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; flourishes with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; improvisation and composition, with performance and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; production.  It is a rich<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and fascinating world we share and there are a myriad of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; perspectives.  How<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; can one rule one superior to another?

But what I wanted to get across is<br/>that<br/>Julia is not IN JI: she is outside it looking at it.  I was comparing style<br/>music to my credo of interstylisticism.  A theory of a style of music is<br/>often naive.</p><p>&gt; On Tuesday, July 9, 2002, at 02:24 , <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Re: More Understanding-to Julia.2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I think the usage by PNM is paramount to what is gained by you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You should clarify what you mean by this statement that can be<br/>&gt; interpreted to be ungracious, to put it lightly.</p><p>PNM has political reasons for what it does.  I have a personal history with<br/>them over many years.  It crossed my mind that Julia&apos;s article might reflect<br/>their own philosophy.  Sorry if my philosophy evades you.  It is neither out<br/>of malice or of the right/wrong context.  I have a different perspective on<br/>things.  This should be understandable for I have just barely gotten a handle<br/>on yours.  :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Clearly, we are<br/>&gt; &gt; bewildered about what you are in fact are saying.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm, I&apos;ve understood her quite well.

But if an idiot savant like me can adjust my<br/>&gt; thinking cap enough to grasp her ideas very clearly as is, I<br/>&gt; have my doubts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  In fact, I am hurt that you think I am<br/>&gt; &gt; engaging in sport that is hurtful.  Aren&apos;t you wildly<br/>&gt; &gt; exaggerating here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think she&apos;s exaggerating. Personally, if I were in her<br/>&gt; shoes, with her credentials, I&apos;d be a lot more forthright in my<br/>&gt; response to you.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joel, please, a short lesson in being forthright?  It would be most<br/>appreciated.  Frankly, I believe I deserve the right to disagree with<br/>published writings.  Academic learn how to handle this.  In Julia&apos;s work I<br/>found things I read about JI that spelled unfamiliarity with the material.<br/>I&apos;m sorry if I did not pray that the alter of current theoretical trend, but<br/>I dissent.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What I am saying (in this imperfect medium) is that unless you<br/>&gt; &gt; are drawing<br/>&gt; &gt; distinctions between things, I am not sure why or what you are saying<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re not criticising what you don&apos;t even understand, are you ?</p><p>Joel, thanks for corroborating my intuition not to get involved with this<br/>thread.  Sorry, Julia, it could not be pristine.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sure (I hope !) you didn&apos;t mean it to come out that way, but<br/>&gt; I found most of your responses to Julia hovering between pompous<br/>&gt; and patronising.

I&apos;ve tried to explain in a couple of posts<br/>&gt; (at least), so has Paul E., and so has Julia herself.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joel, I am trying not to portray too much sarcasm.  If you want to write me<br/>further privately or on metatuning, that&apos;ll be fine.

The negativity in the criticisms of Julia Werntz have past the point of no return. I also never intended any insult or hurtfulness toward you. I sincerely feel I made a fair comment on your posts about Julia.</p><p>As far as lessons in graciousness, read Julia&apos;s responses to this forum. Read Margo&apos;s posts referring to Julia. That is graciousness. Then look at the nature of the posts from other quarters. If one were to simply list the names she&apos;s been called, it is disgraceful.</p><p>One.

She interpreted something I said as a claim she didn&apos;t understand her subject matter and went ballistic. I&apos;ll admit (now) I suspect that to be so, but it isn&apos;t what I said. Going personal is not a way to discuss the matter in question, so I suppose I err here also, but I think canonizing Julia makes about as much sense as canonizing me. We&apos;re both prickly--and so are you, Joel, come to that.</p></div>
