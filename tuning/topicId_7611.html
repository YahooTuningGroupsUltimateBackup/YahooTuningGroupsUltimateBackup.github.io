It doesn&apos;t matter to me if people want to make up new<br/>terms, words, or acronyms for that which they do, or to describe that which<br/>exists. In ignoring common linguistic derivations, however, and redefining<br/>for one&apos;s own purposes (noble as they might be) the most expected result<br/>will be confusion.</p><p>I doubt there is more of a center of the universe for the bagel than NYC.<br/>Imagine if I, on the other hand, started trying to convince people that<br/>bagels not only referred to those delicious boiled-then-baked breads, but<br/>also to what they think of as doughnuts, and pretzels, and scones. It<br/>doesn&apos;t make the world a better place, it just devalues the meaning of the<br/>word &quot;bagel&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not making any threats, and only use passionate language to show the<br/>depth of frustration at the lack of progress; &quot;Shooting from the hip&quot;,<br/>Johnny calls it. And no, to answer the question, I am not a<br/>&quot;microtonalist&quot;. I am, and have always been, a musician; no other term<br/>better suits what I do or who I am. And as for taking risks for art, I have<br/>no problem with that and do it all the time myself; OTOH, jumping out of a<br/>plane with no parachute is taking a risk as well, a very stupid risk.

Though my own music is<br/>self-described as &quot;polymicrotonal,&quot; it began years after the AFMM began.  It<br/>was the interstylistic weave for a concert that would give the program a<br/>proposed festival air.</p><p>The American part of the name was the result of a meeting between Jon Catler,<br/>Dean Drummond, and myself in 1980.  My plan was to have a New York Festival<br/>of Microtonal Music.  Since Dean had already planned on a similar title, and<br/>had seniority in our view, I spoke up and said we would use American<br/>(probably thinking of a National and an American league as in baseball).  It<br/>was out of respect, and yet a refusal to capitulate, that the Introductory<br/>concert took place on May 7, 1981.  The program sported pieces by Ockegam and<br/>Gesualdo in non-12, as well as quartertones, &amp; 31-tone music.</p><p>If the program was to take off, we would hold a Premiere concert in the<br/>coming Fall, and did.  I still truly do not believe that limiting the term<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; to only intervals smaller than a semitone when there is no solid<br/>term for the important larger intervals is &quot;common sense&quot; but I will make<br/>this the Last word on the term &apos;microtone&apos; (from me)-at least for awhile.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
