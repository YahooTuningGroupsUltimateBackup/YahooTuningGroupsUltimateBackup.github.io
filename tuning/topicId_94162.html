Here&apos;s why:</p><p>1. Too many conflicting theories about estimating the concordance of ratios.  Consider the difference between a 12-tET major 3rd and a 17-tET major third.  If we allow a plus/minus 8 cent margin of error around a ratio, the lowest-limit ratio we can give 400 cents is 24/19, and the lowest for 17-tET is 14/11.  From a periodicity stand-point, the 17-tET 3rd is more concordant.  Also, if we look at the interval between the 5th partial of a root tone and the 4th partial of the note a 3rd above it, the 12-tET 3rd is higher in critical-band roughness than the 17-tET 3rd (it has a more audible beating to it).  Yet from a harmonic entropy perspective, 400 cents is judged as more concordant because it is &quot;closer&quot; to 5/4.  So in some regards the 12-tET third is more concordant, and in some regards it isn&apos;t...and this definitely reflects my experience with 17-tET.  So it&apos;s really impossible say which one is absolutely more concordant.</p><p>2. Too many ways to interpret many tempered intervals as ratios.  Do we go for the lowest-limit ratio within 8 cents?  Do we treat them according to some regular mapping, and allow for errors larger than the 8-cent threshold of indistinguishability?   Do we simply ignore ratios above a certain Tenney Height?  Do we look at harmonic series chords that are high up in the series?  I just don&apos;t know.</p><p>To do justice to all possible interpretations would be vastly too time-consuming (for me, and for the reader), and to single out any one interpretation is too biased for my liking.  To switch interpretations depending on temperament (i.e. look at 19-EDO in terms of JI approximations, 14-EDO in terms of critical band roughness between partials, etc.) would make it too hard to compare between them in musically-meaningful ways.</p><p>Basically, I&apos;m torn by this dilemma: on the one hand, it does seem important when some EDO well-approximates some simple-integer ratio (or ratios), but on the other hand, if an EDO *doesn&apos;t* well-approximate any simple-integer ratios, that doesn&apos;t mean it sounds like shite.  8-EDO, for instance--about the simplest thing it approximates well is 11/6, but I swear it sounds more relaxed than 11 or even 14 if you use it right.  And furthermore, I firmly believe intervals high in harmonic entropy--i.e. describable in terms of multiple ratios of similar complexity--are tunable by ear and musically-useful, and possibly even stable or pleasant in the right context, but they make messes out of any attempt at definition in terms of ratios.</p><p>So I&apos;m giving up, I&apos;m leaving psychoacoustics out of it and taking the Blackwood approach of &quot;these are some nice-sounding chords I&apos;ve found, and this is how &quot;smooth&quot; typical major/minor triads sound&quot;.  Most musicians probably wouldn&apos;t want to be bothered with the psychoacoustics anyway, I&apos;m sure.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=94168 href="#94168">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 4:08:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Nov 3, 2010 at 6:20 PM, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet from a harmonic entropy perspective, 400 cents is judged as more concordant because it is &quot;closer&quot; to 5/4.

It&apos;s just a really simple but powerful consonance<br/>model. I don&apos;t think that it&apos;s worth getting into the absolute<br/>specifics.

And double ha.</p><p>One thing I&apos;m learning as I develop this &quot;harmonic laplace transform&quot;<br/>function is that the resultant entropy calculation will yield a<br/>slightly different curve from HE -- less consonant dyads will have<br/>&quot;narrower&quot; fields of attraction than more consonant ones. This means<br/>that there will be more minima than with HE, but that the &quot;valleys&quot;<br/>around the minima will be much narrower, indicating that these<br/>intervals are extremely sensitive to mistuning.

I keep<br/>throwing this 0-350-702 example around. Play that chord and it&apos;s<br/>pretty dissonant. Then add a just 7/4, 9/4, 11/4, etc on top of it and<br/>it becomes a very palatable mix of consonance and dissonance. The same<br/>applies to really sharp 5ths a la 13-tet or whatever - go with<br/>0-384-738, then add 7/4, 8/4, 9/4, whatever, on top of it. Suddenly<br/>the 1/3-tone sharp fifth becomes much more musically useful.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=94170 href="#94170">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2010 4:16:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sounds good to me!<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gang,<br/>&gt; I think that I am going to have to give up on describing EDOs in terms of ratios and harmonics they approximate in the primer at which I&apos;m slowly chipping away.
