I&apos;d typically do some combination of the following:<br/>practice for 1-2 hours a day, have a 1 hour jazz lesson, have a 1 hour<br/>classical lesson, have one of three 1-hour small group ensembles, jam<br/>for an hour or two, go to a mandatory performance of some other<br/>ensemble, play a gig. In general, aside from my other engineering<br/>classes, and homework, and sometimes this list, my free time was spent<br/>jamming with friends. That&apos;s a little under 1/2 of my waking hours<br/>being spent doing nothing but bombarding my ears with auditory stimuli<br/>far outside the norm, consistently, over the course of many years.<br/>This is pretty typical for a music student, and in my case even less<br/>than the actual majors because I had engineering stuff to take care of<br/>too.</p><p>In short, musicians don&apos;t lead normal lives. As a result of this<br/>lifestyle, their auditory systems adapt.

In fact, I&apos;d expect that to be<br/>the case. What I know is that after a year of being similarly fanatic<br/>about 15, 16, and 22-EDO, I&apos;ve noticed perceptual changes which come<br/>and go depending on how much time I spend immersed in a certain<br/>tuning, and this would be consistent with that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=102886 href="#102886">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2012 5:44:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I concur with Mike&apos;s experiences as a music major and as a xenharmonist<br/>composer / performer.<br/>I don&apos;t hear things nearly the same way I did in 2008 which is when I<br/>started to heavily become xen.</p><p>And the same thing happened when I transitioned from listening to only rock<br/>music to encompassing all music, especially classical, as a music major.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Jan 16, 2012 at 4:19 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And for the record, I don&apos;t even know if I agree with this logic in a<br/>&gt; limited psychoacoustic sense<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Mon, Jan 16, 2012 at 2:16 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually it&apos;s not.
