Even if I found some good ones and could play them perfectly at a moderate tempo, they&apos;re necessarily sort of long and listeners might not realize anything weird is going on unless they pay close attention.</p><p>But if you think about it, a comma pump is something designed to prove to you that you&apos;re not listening to JI, because it&apos;s something that can&apos;t happen in JI. But the thing everybody&apos;s used to already isn&apos;t JI, it&apos;s 12edo. Can we define an equivalent thing that proves to you that you&apos;re not listening to 12edo?</p><p>Given a 1-to-1 correspondence between some intervals of one scale and some intervals of a different scale, define a &quot;category breaker&quot; as a linear relationship between the intervals of one that doesn&apos;t hold in the other.</p><p>I wrote a (very short) program that will spit out the simplest possible category breakers if you supply the interval correspondence. This correspondence is the only arbitrary, hand-picked thing about it. For 19 I chose this:</p><p>19 ... 12</p><p> 3 &lt;-&gt; 2<br/> 5 &lt;-&gt; 3<br/> 6 &lt;-&gt; 4<br/> 8 &lt;-&gt; 5<br/>11 &lt;-&gt; 7<br/>13 &lt;-&gt; 8<br/>14 &lt;-&gt; 9<br/>16 &lt;-&gt; 10</p><p>And the shortest results are:</p><p>(6, 6, 6, 6, 14)</p><p>(3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 14), (3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 11), (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 13), (5, 5, 5, 13, 13, 16), (6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8), (6, 6, 6, 11, 14, 14)</p><p>These are collections of intervals in 19edo that add up to some number of octaves, but whose corresponding intervals in 12edo do not.</p><p>So the simplest result is... a magic comma pump. You can reformulate it as many different equations, for example &quot;M3 + M3 + M3 + M3 = m3 + octave&quot; or &quot;M3 + M3 + M3 = m6 + m3&quot;, but they all represent the same linear relationship between the intervals. In this case it&apos;s a familiar relationship because it&apos;s the same one between 6/5, 5/4, and 2/1 that&apos;s caused by 3125/3072 vanishing.</p><p>That&apos;s the only 5-interval relationship. The 6-interval relationships are:</p><p>(3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 14) - &quot;magic comma pump with one M3 split&quot;<br/>(3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 11) - shows 2048/1875 is a M2 (either magic or negri)<br/>(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 13) - &quot;hanson comma pump&quot;<br/>(5, 5, 5, 13, 13, 16) - shows 3456/3125 is a M2 (either magic or hanson)<br/>(6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8) - &quot;magic comma pump&quot;<br/>(6, 6, 6, 11, 14, 14) - &quot;magic comma pump&quot;</p><p>Hmm, that&apos;s sort of disappointing. But we can add more correspondences and see what we get. If we add in 2 &lt;-&gt; 1 and 17 &lt;-&gt; 11, we get</p><p>(2, 2, 2, 13)</p><p>which is related to negri and indeed sounds quite unlike 12edo. If instead we add the alternative correspondences 1 &lt;-&gt; 1 and 18 &lt;-&gt; 11, we get</p><p>(1, 1, 1, 16), (1, 1, 3, 14), (1, 1, 6, 11), (1, 6, 6, 6)</p><p>which are also fruitful avenues to explore. The first three involve ultra-chromatically interpolating between familiar intervals (the second two very much reminiscent of the enharmonic genus), and the last expresses the fact that the 128/125 diesis does not vanish.</p><p>Here&apos;s the python program if anyone&apos;s interested:</p><p>from itertools import *<br/>def category_breakers(d, m1, m2, n):<br/>  &apos;&apos;&apos;d - dict of (real EDO, category EDO) pairs<br/>     m1 - real modulus, i.e. EDO number<br/>     m2 - category modulus (often 12)<br/>     n - number of intervals to use at once&apos;&apos;&apos;<br/>  for x in combinations_with_replacement(d.keys(), n):<br/>    if sum(x) % m1 == 0 and sum(d[i] for i in x) % m2 != 0:<br/>      yield x</p><p>and you use it like this:</p><p>list(category_breakers({3:2,5:3,6:4,8:5,11:7,13:8,14:9,16:10}, 19, 12, 5))</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2012 3:25:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>LOL, I was just gonna ask how you&apos;re liking the guitar!

This seems to be what your program works out.  Negri&apos;s great for this.  But again, I didn&apos;t have much luck.  Which is why I gave you the guitar.  I expect you&apos;ll fare better, as you have more patience than I!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2012 3:32:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; LOL, I was just gonna ask how you&apos;re liking the guitar!
