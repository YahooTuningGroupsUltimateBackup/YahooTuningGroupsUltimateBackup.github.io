On p. 55, he accurately gives ratio 273/256, [111.3<br/>cents], for the mujannab fret, and inaccurately gives the value 112<br/>cents.  The latter inaccurate cent value also appears in: _The Music<br/>of Islam_, p. 461.</p><p>From my: _Musical Mathematics: A Practice in the Mathematics of<br/>Tuning Instruments and Analyzing Scales_:</p><p>******************************</p><p>&quot;The illustrious successor to Al-Farabi was Ibn Sina (9801037).<br/>The next discussion will focus on Ibn Sina&apos;s musical treatises in<br/>the Kitab al-shifa (Book of the cure) and in the Kitab al-najat<br/>(Book of the delivery).  A French translation of the former exists<br/>in D&apos;Erlanger&apos;s _La Musique Arabe_, Volume 2, and a German<br/>translation of the latter is contained in Mahmoud el-Hefny&apos;s<br/>dissertation _Ibn Sina&apos;s Musiklehre_ (Ibn Sina&apos;s teaching on<br/>music).  Although these two texts give slightly different procedures<br/>for the division of lute strings, in the final analysis both tunings<br/>are identical.&quot;</p><p>******************************</p><p>Hefny also accurately gives ratio 273/256 on p. 49.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Cris Forster, Music Director<br/><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael Zapf &lt;zapfzapfzapf@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; On the Oud, the mujannab is the first semitone fret<br/>&gt; above the open string.

It seems you may<br/>agree with Dave Keenan&apos;s definition of the term JI, which I invite<br/>him to elaborate on in this context. I believe that these differences<br/>in intontation of less than a comma are indeed powerful and<br/>expressive as you say, and that they have absolutely nothing to do<br/>with JI or particular exact whole-number ratios. But this is a very<br/>unpopular view on this list, where a deep preoccupation with and<br/>belief in exact ratios predominates.</p><p>On the other hand, 16/15 meaningfully occurs in a JI tuning system as<br/>a result of (at least) three notes tuned in sequential JI; for<br/>example, a 4:3 followed by a 4:5 (since 1/1 * 4:3 * 4:5 = 16/15).</p><p>Take care,<br/>Paul</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael Zapf &lt;zapfzapfzapf@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On the Oud, the mujannab is the first semitone fret<br/>&gt; above the open string.
