It is this flawed<br/>epistemology and its expression in the form of a &quot;musical Darwinism&quot;<br/>that has engendered a sort of revolt by the protagonists of historically<br/>informed performance led by Mark Lindley. Lindley points out that for<br/>every music, there is a temperament and that equal temperament is<br/>just as appropriate for, say, the virginalists as meantone is to<br/>Schoenberg.  He goes a bit too far, however, by implying that equal<br/>temperament is an un-historical temperament and shouldn&apos;t be used in the<br/>performance of early music (s.v., Bach and the Das wohltemperirte<br/>Clavier).  The result of this revisionist approach was to galvanize<br/>performers into two camps: the 19th-century crowd (which thinks anything<br/>other than ET sounds out of tune) and the early music crowd<br/>(which thinks that ET sounds out of tune and refuses to use it, even<br/>where it could or *should* be used).</p><p>Enter Owen Jorgensen.  Prof. Jorgensen noticed that there where a great<br/>many performers of early music that had no idea of how to tune their<br/>keyboard instruments so he gather a collection of supposedly historical<br/>temperaments, invented tuning methods for them and published them in his<br/>_Tuning the Historical Temperaments by Ear_ (1977).  This monograph,<br/>just as  _Tuning, Containing the Perfection... (1993) is based on<br/>methods and, yea, temperaments that didn&apos;t exist!  For example, he gives<br/>instructions for tuning the &quot;equal-beating well tempered version of the<br/>Francisco Salinas 1/3 comma temperament in the acoustic tonality of c<br/>major.&quot;  Salinas never described this temperament!  Jorgensen goes on to<br/>describe the &quot;Aron-Neidhardt well temperament&quot; - only that neither Aaron<br/>nor Neidhardt ever wrote about it!  (Jorgensen&apos;s instructions actually<br/>produce a variation of what is normally called Kirnberger III, only that<br/>Jorgensen places the schisma in E-B instead of F# -C# where it belongs).</p><p>The whole premise of Prof. Jorgensen&apos;s works, that these temperaments<br/>where tuned solely by ear, is wrong: There where two ways to tune in the<br/>18th century, (1) by ear; (2) with a monochord.  The primary sources<br/>make this clear. Although the theory of beats (destructive interference)<br/>was talked about by various 17th and 18th-century writers (chiefly<br/>Sauveur and Robert Smith), it wasn&apos;t codified until Helmholtz.  Thus, to<br/>give instructions for &quot;equal beating&quot; 18th-century temperaments is<br/>un-historical at best and deceptive at worst.  Jorgensen doesn&apos;t convey<br/>history, he invents it!</p><p>Anyone who has read either _Tuning, containing the Perfection_ or<br/>_Tuning the Historical_ knows that they contain other flaws (what is<br/>&quot;well temperament&quot;? ), some just as grave as the above.  (Where in God&apos;s<br/>Holy Name is the scientific apparatus commonly called documentation in<br/>Jorgensen&apos;s work???  Why can&apos;t we be given quotes, source names and page<br/>numbers?!?).  We &quot;Specialists in Historic Tuning&quot; have even speculated<br/>the un-wisperable: that Jorgensen can&apos;t even read the primary sources.<br/>(To my knowledge, there is not *one* quote in any language other<br/>than English in any of his works...)  How can you study this field if<br/>you can&apos;t read German, French or Italian (minimally)?  The whole thesis<br/>of _Tuning, contain the Perfection_, that true ET didn&apos;t exist<br/>before the 20th century, is also specious.  True ET doesn&apos;t exist today!<br/> Any professional piano tuner will tell you that he/she<br/>stretches octaves on the piano and any harpsichord tuner will tell you<br/>that no matter *what* temperament is set, it&apos;s all out of tune 5 minutes<br/>after you&apos;re done tuning (sometimes *while* you&apos;re tuning!).  Of all<br/>the harpsichord concerts that I&apos;ve been to, only 3 have had really<br/>in-tune harpsichords.  Jorgensen rejects ET in the performance<br/>of period music on the basis that it was impossible to tune perfectly<br/>before 1917.  My point: no temperament is perfectly in tune<br/>(acoustically) &quot;in the field,&quot; especially on the harpsichord, so the<br/>&quot;acoustically correct&quot; thesis should be put on the Misthaufen.</p><p>&quot;Who can I trust?&quot; you might be asking.  Other than the primary sources,<br/>read anything by Mark Lindley, Rudolf Rasch and Dominique Devie.  For<br/>instructions on how to tune *real* historical temperaments, see:<br/>Claudio di Veroli. _Unequal Temperaments and their Role in the<br/>Performance of Early Music_.  Buenos Aires (?), Argentina, 1978.</p><p>The whole point of my ramblings is that in recreating music of the past<br/>we should must not forget the sonorities of the past created by tuning.<br/> Just as we wouldn&apos;t use incorrect strings on a violin to play 17th-<br/>century music, we should not use incorrect tunings.</p><p>To those reading Jorgensen and Barbour as the Word of God:</p><p>It&apos;s not.</p></div><h3><a id=45050 href="#45050">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2003 3:02:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; by Aleksander Frosztega</p><p>&gt;  Just as we wouldn&apos;t use incorrect strings on a violin to play 17th-<br/>&gt; century music, we should not use incorrect tunings.</p><p>What&apos;s an incorrect tuning?</p></div><h3><a id=45051 href="#45051">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2003 3:19:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Tuesday, June 24, 2003 3:02 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: a negative review of Jorgensen&apos;s work</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; by Aleksander Frosztega<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Just as we wouldn&apos;t use incorrect strings on a violin to play 17th-<br/>&gt; &gt; century music, we should not use incorrect tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s an incorrect tuning?</p><p>in the context of the diaglog from which i<br/>extracted the quote i posted, Frosztega is<br/>arguing that Jorgensen simply invented many<br/>of the tunings which his books seem to present<br/>as &quot;historical&quot;.</p><p>i&apos;m pretty sure that what he meant by &quot;incorrect<br/>tunings&quot; is tunings which are offered as being<br/>historical but which in fact are not.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=45052 href="#45052">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/24/2003 7:38:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>One possible example of an incorrect tuning would be Aaron-Neidhardt II, used<br/>by Anthony Newman for his recording of the Well-Tempered Clavier as played on<br/>harpsichord.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>p.s.
