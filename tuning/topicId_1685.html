I hope you don&apos;t mind me forwarding your reply to<br/>the tuning list.  I hoping that some helpful threads would be generated on<br/>the subject of the carillon and all its related issues.  I need help, as I<br/>am still a beginner!</p><p>Replys below</p><p>Peace,<br/>Darren</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This post and the html file contain my latest thoughts on the tuning for<br/>&gt; the &gt;microtonal carillon I am building.  The carillon will use steel bars<br/>&gt; driven &gt;by solenoids and amplified through large outdoor PA speakers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I remember this boy when he was in Denny&apos;s carport filled with cobwebs!</p><p>Yes, I encounter a few cobwebs.  I restored the 5/7 keyboard to working<br/>order.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The second table in the file illustrates the keyboard layout.  It<br/>features<br/>&gt; &gt;128 keys in an 8 by 16 format.  The keyboard can be either a matrix midi<br/>&gt; &gt;controller or use simple analog swiches to drive the solenoids directly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Analog switches, all the way.  Just be sure they feel good!</p><p>I will use analog switches no matter what -- the question yet to be<br/>answered would be whether it would be a keyboard that generates midi<br/>messages that activate the solenoids, or if the switches would connect<br/>directly to the solenoids.  Direct connection has the advantage of being<br/>cheaper and not requiring the intervention of our very busy and somewhat<br/>unavailable techno wiz, Bob Benchic.</p><p>I was planning to use old computer keyboard switches.  Any thoughts on this<br/>type of switch?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I believe this arrangement gives the best of both worlds.  It allows for</p><p>&gt; &gt;playing of the 8x8 matrix in its pure form, and at the same time uses<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;matrix resources as a scale allowing for voice leading, chord inversions<br/>&gt; &gt;and melodic lines not possible with a strict matrix.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could you illustrate?  I can&apos;t see what your changes amount to.</p><p>If you looked at the keyboard arrangement at<br/><a href="http://www.acceleration.net/dburgess/matrix.html">www.acceleration.net/dburgess/matrix.html</a>, the changes should be apparent.<br/>What I don&apos;t like about the pure matrix is that it limits the chord<br/>voicing.  Taking the matrix as a scale eliminates this problem.  I worked<br/>out some examples a while back and will try to dig them up.  I am not much<br/>of a composer/theorist yet, so my ability to articulate what I am<br/>describing is limited for now.  My main focus has always been on flesh and<br/>bones instruments.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who will be playing it?  You?</p><p>I will be playing it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There are of course large gaps  (esp. between 1/1 and 16/15, 15/8 and<br/>2/1)<br/>&gt; &gt;which could be filled in Partch-style with secondary intervals to yeild<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;continuous 15 limit scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t worry about the gaps too much.  You&apos;re not going to be playing<br/>&gt; the whole thing as a melody, are you?  I think the melodic resources of<br/>&gt; this scale are its harmonic and subharmonic series segments.  There are<br/>&gt; plenty of very small intervals near the center of the diamond for<br/>effects,<br/>&gt; if you want them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other question is, how many tones do you have to work with?</p><p>I have about 120 solenoids that I will be stealing from the original<br/>instument</p><p> I&apos;d rather<br/>&gt; have a three octaves of straight diamond than two of enriched diamond.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Why?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wilson has shown that Partch (unconsciously) selected his secondary<br/>ratios<br/>&gt; based on a linear series (chain of fifths).  Are you familiar with<br/>Wilson&apos;s<br/>&gt; work ala Xenharmonikon 3?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Please tell me where I could get more information this.  Particularily, I<br/>would like to determine the best secondary intervals to add to a 15limit<br/>diamond.</p><p>Darren</p></div><h3><a id=1697 href="#1697">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/1999 6:00:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I hoping that some helpful threads would be generated on the subject of<br/>the &gt;carillon and all its related issues.</p><p>Cool!</p><p>&gt;I will use analog switches no matter what -- the question yet to be<br/>&gt;answered would be whether it would be a keyboard that generates midi<br/>&gt;messages that activate the solenoids, or if the switches would connect<br/>&gt;directly to the solenoids.

If the instrument is<br/>for you, then you don&apos;t need anybody&apos;s opinion but your own.
