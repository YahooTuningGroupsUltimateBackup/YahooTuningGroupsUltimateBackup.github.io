All the measurements (I<br/>&gt;believe Gary Morrison did quite a few) confirmed the theory on this,<br/>&gt;which is quite clear. The mechanisms producing the vibrations in these<br/>&gt;instruments (lips, reed, bow sticking and slipping, vocal cords) are<br/>&gt;single-element oscillators whose nonlinearities can only produce<br/>&gt;phase-locked harmonic partials. Go back to those old messages (I<br/>&gt;believe they&apos;re pre-onelist). We went into great detail.</p><p>Very interesting...  this is closely related to a discussion on<br/>resonators in September of this year.

This is very tricky --<br/>it involves segregating the noise and the amplitude fluctuations of the<br/>partials from the signal to be Fourier transformed -- a process which<br/>involves some subjective judgment (remember, a Fourier transform will give<br/>you a set of pure tones that reproduce any original signal, but these pure<br/>tones always have constant amplitude).</p></div>
