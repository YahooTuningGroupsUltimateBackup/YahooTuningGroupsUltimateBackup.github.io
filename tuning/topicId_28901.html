Virus warnings aren&apos;t<br/>distributed like this.</p><p>Good anti virus programs are McAfee, Norton,<br/>and Dr Solomon.</p><p>If one wants a free one, AVG is also very good,<br/>and remarkable as it is free for private users.</p><p><a href="http://www.grisoft.com/html/us_index.cfm">http://www.grisoft.com/html/us_index.cfm</a></p><p>I use Norton myself and am very impressed with<br/>it. Runs in the background with very little<br/>impact on resources, and if you so much as<br/>highlight a file in a file open dialog, it<br/>checks it for viruses automatically, as<br/>I know as I have a few Word docs containing<br/>macro viruses that I have to check how a virus<br/>program is working.</p><p>Also pops up whenever I get sent the Sir Cam<br/>virus file attachment, which I get sent most days<br/>nowadays, (from people I&apos;ve never heard from, so not<br/>sure why they have my address in their address<br/>books, except that it is on several web pages<br/>and program download sites).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
