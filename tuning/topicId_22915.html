(Not that your<br/>work is off-topic here, its just that that is where some of the<br/>information has been collected).</p><p>I&apos;ve been recently working with the concept of dropping scales onto<br/>such a curve and seeing how they &apos;want&apos; to tune. Currently my program<br/>only does diatonic scales (though not just &apos;the&apos; diatonic). The curve<br/>generation has a big influence on the results, and I haven&apos;t aurally<br/>correllated some of the results which is necessary to see if I&apos;m<br/>on the right track.</p><p>I&apos;ll search for the URL to your paper.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
