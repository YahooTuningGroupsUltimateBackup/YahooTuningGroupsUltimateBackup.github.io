For justly<br/>tuned fifths, as you discovered, A# is sharper than Bb, hence for<br/>fifths flatter than the 1/11-comma meantone of 12-equal, A# will be<br/>flatter than Bb. It all can be derived therefore from what you<br/>already knew, with no math.</p></div><h3><a id=52506 href="#52506">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2004 2:57:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;hstraub64@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; An old question - and I thought I had answered it long ago...<br/>&gt; Calculating the ratios based on pure fifth and pure major third<br/>&gt; (5-limit) I got that Bb is higher -</p><p>Sorry, I am waiting for my new glasses to arrive and I see now you<br/>were in the 5-limit, which really confuses things since now you&apos;ve<br/>got two sizes of whole tones, 9/8 and 10/9, plus 16/15 and 25/24<br/>semitones. You have a Bb which is a minor third above G, and another<br/>which is a fourth above F; and lots of ways of defining A#, etc etc.<br/>It&apos;s confusing enough for your web page just with fifths, and I&apos;d<br/>stick to that. However if you absolutely must you can claim that C#<br/>is a 25/24 above C, which it is if it is the major third above an A<br/>of 5/6, and Db is a major third below an F of 4/3, and hence is (4/3)<br/>(4/5) = 16/15; and 16/15 &gt; 25/24.</p><p>&gt; But now I read a newsgroup posting stating the opposite: that A# is<br/>&gt; higher than Bb, at least if it appears as a leading tone - because a<br/>&gt; leading tone works the better the smaller the interval is.</p><p>That just says some people play that way; it&apos;s confusing enough<br/>without that issue added as well.</p></div><h3><a id=52513 href="#52513">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2004 12:52:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;hstraub64@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; An old question - and I thought I had answered it long ago...<br/>&gt; Calculating the ratios based on pure fifth and pure major third<br/>&gt; (5-limit) I got that Bb is higher - I even wrote an entry into my<br/>&gt; Music and mathematics FAQ<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://home.datacomm.ch/straub/mamuth/mamufaq.html#Q_A#_Bb">http://home.datacomm.ch/straub/mamuth/mamufaq.html#Q_A#_Bb</a>).</p><p>In 5-limit JI, every note name occurs at an infinite number of<br/>different acoustical pitches, separated by 81:80 from one another.
