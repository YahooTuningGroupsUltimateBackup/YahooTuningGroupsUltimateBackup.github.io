I&apos;m a<br/>&gt;little confused by the sets that Herman indicates next to the<br/>&gt;blackjack tunings...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And what exactly are the tunings &quot;otonal&quot; &quot;utonal&quot; &quot;beating&quot;<br/>&gt;and &quot;microstep&quot; ?? and what do the sets of numbers mean again??</p><p>I intend to put more information about the various tunings on the page<br/>eventually. The numbers next to the blackjack tunings are decimal notation<br/>(see <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/decimal_lattice.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/decimal_lattice.htm</a>).</p><p>Each Blackjack tuning uses a different equivalent for the major triad:</p><p>otonal 4:5:7<br/>utonal 1/(7:5:4)<br/>beating 1/1 : 11/9 : 32/21<br/>microstep 7:8:10</p><p>(actually, the 72-TET approximations of these intervals.)</p><p>For instance, the otonal version works out like this:</p><p>   decimal       degrees of 72-TET      original</p><p>  5^  3^  1^        37  23   9         B   F#  C#<br/>2   0   8^  6^    14   0  58  44     G   D   A   E</p><p>(that&apos;s the basic scale; there&apos;s also an extra note, 28 of 72, or &quot;4&quot; in<br/>decimal notation, corresponding to the C natural of the original.)</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
