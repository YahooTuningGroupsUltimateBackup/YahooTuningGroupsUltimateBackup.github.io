Standing before it,<br/>the acoustical guide (headphone with infrared system), made me listen to<br/>three metallic strings, sounding as 1/1, 3/2 and 2/1. So I really thought<br/>that came from the instrument I saw. Today, I checked the information on the<br/>CD from the Museum and saw that I was supposed to hear a &apos;monochord&apos;. Still:<br/>three strings...</p><p>Paul, I understand now that there&apos;s no linear,<br/>mathematical relation between weight/ string tension and pitch.<br/>So, the Museum gives definitely a false impression! They should at least<br/>explain<br/>why this is a myth.</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
