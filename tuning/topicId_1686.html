The carillon will use steel bars<br/>&gt; driven &gt;by solenoids and amplified through large outdoor PA speakers.<br/>&gt;</p><p> I remember this boy when he was in Denny&apos;s carport filled with cobwebs!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The first table in the file is the 15 limit tonality diamond, nothing<br/>new...</p><p> No, but one helluva good scale!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I have successfully developed a method for achieving this relationship<br/>&gt; &gt;of partials to a great level of accuracy.</p><p> Rock!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The second table in the file illustrates the keyboard layout.  It<br/>features<br/>&gt; &gt;128 keys in an 8 by 16 format.  The keyboard can be either a matrix midi<br/>&gt; &gt;controller or use simple analog swiches to drive the solenoids directly.</p><p>Analog switches, all the way.  Just be sure they feel good!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I believe this arrangement gives the best of both worlds.  It allows for</p><p>&gt; &gt;playing of the 8x8 matrix in its pure form, and at the same time uses<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;matrix resources as a scale allowing for voice leading, chord inversions<br/>&gt; &gt;and melodic lines not possible with a strict matrix.<br/>&gt;</p><p> Could you illustrate?  I can&apos;t see what your changes amount to.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>Who will be playing it?  You?  Then what really counts is do you like it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There are of course large gaps  (esp. between 1/1 and 16/15, 15/8 and<br/>2/1)<br/>&gt; &gt;which could be filled in Partch-style with secondary intervals to yeild<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;continuous 15 limit scale.<br/>&gt;</p><p> I wouldn&apos;t worry about the gaps too much.  You&apos;re not going to be playing<br/> the whole thing as a melody, are you?  I think the melodic resources of<br/> this scale are its harmonic and subharmonic series segments.  There are<br/> plenty of very small intervals near the center of the diamond for effects,<br/> if you want them.</p><p> The other question is, how many tones do you have to work with?  I&apos;d<br/>rather<br/> have a three octaves of straight diamond than two of enriched diamond.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I have played around with substituting some of the duplicated intervals<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;the keyboard  (ie 1/1, 2/1, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3 and 6/5) and including<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;resourses that Partch added to his scale.  I was actually able to<br/>include<br/>&gt; &gt;all of his secondary intervals, although substituting these intervals in<br/>&gt; for &gt;the repeated ones creates alot of inconsistancy in the keyboard<br/>&gt; fingerings &gt;for some of the basic scales.<br/>&gt;</p><p> Wilson has shown that Partch (unconsciously) selected his secondary ratios<br/> based on a linear series (chain of fifths).  Are you familiar with<br/>Wilson&apos;s<br/> work ala Xenharmonikon 3?</p><p> Adding secondary ratios to a diamond keyboard layout is asking for<br/>trouble.<br/>  Partch&apos;s keyboard designs always had the complete scale arranged<br/> chromatically, with seperate diamonds.</p><p> But it can be done without loss of fingering consistency, on the linear<br/> series.  Erv has a (unpublished) keyboard program for the 15-limit diamond<br/> called Quert.  These keyboards have their own drawbacks, but you may like<br/> to be aware of them before you proceed.</p><p> Carl</p></div>
