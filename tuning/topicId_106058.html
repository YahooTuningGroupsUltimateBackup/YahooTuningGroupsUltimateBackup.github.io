And as far as I know, there was a mailing list going on well before that time, too. It is quite interesting to see that some of the guys that were there in the very beginning (which I missed, too) are still here nowadays.</p><p>I have started to write things into the Xenharmonie-Wiki, at the moment mainly links to german-speaking resources. See you there, then!</p><p>Hans</p></div>
