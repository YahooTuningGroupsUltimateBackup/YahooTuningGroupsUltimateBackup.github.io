This<br/>neanderthal flute is a broken segment of a larger bone.  It has four holes<br/>remaining in it.  They make a number of claims based on the various<br/>measurements, and even attempted to reproduce it, which supposedly confirmed<br/>their theories.</p><p>Darren<br/>&gt; About two years ago I found a web page which discusses a Neanderthal flute<br/>&gt; made 43,000 to 82,000 year old of cave bear femur bone.  It was a segment<br/>&gt; with 4 holes, the two end holes being broken.  The article speculates on<br/>&gt; the sound of the flute before it was broken so long ago.
