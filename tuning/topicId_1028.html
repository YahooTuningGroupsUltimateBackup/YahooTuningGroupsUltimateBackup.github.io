I guess I&apos;m going with Lycos unless<br/>&gt; somebody has a better idea...</p><p>&gt; Any better, or different ideas to try?</p><p>I know that I am famous for bad file storage advice but<br/>let me try again.</p><p>The geocites account I have seems to be working well.<br/>No one has had any problems downloading music from it<br/>AT ALL. I think you get 10MB or so max, but that still<br/>enables you to put up pieces long enough for people to<br/>get them AND the cool thing is the geocities servers<br/>don&apos;t have that weird file time limit problem/feature<br/>that the yahoogroups servers do.</p><p>The only thing you need to remember is that your music<br/>files MUST be linked to from your index page ON<br/>geocities and that if people try to bypass that and<br/>just dirictly download the file without first visiting<br/>geocities (and looking at the popup ad), you&apos;ll get<br/>your account suspended for violating the &apos;no off-site<br/>storage&apos; rules. And it takes lots of mailing yahoo to<br/>get the account turned back on. I know this from<br/>experience.</p><p>If you need help with the html or whatever, just ask me<br/>and I&apos;ll throw together a lame and primitive front end<br/>for you, or show you how to do it.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what the deal is with lycos. I spent an<br/>entire day a few weekends back and could not get your<br/>music but I have no problem downloading my own from<br/>that site. I wonder if there is any pattern to it --<br/>people with this or that browser, or whatever.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
