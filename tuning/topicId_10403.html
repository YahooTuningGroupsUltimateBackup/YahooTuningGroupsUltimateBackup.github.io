However, that&apos;s just my view,<br/>&gt;and I wouldn&apos;t expect everyone to agree with it!</p><p>Could you clarify what you&apos;re opposed to?  Is it a new option applied<br/>across a wide band of music you oppose?  Or is it the idea that a<br/>&quot;revisionist&quot; movement might arise and trample everything historic,<br/>&quot;authentic&quot; in its sight?  The latter idea I would consider an<br/>unnecessary fear; nothing is going to kill 12-tET (and other tunings) in<br/>the near future!  The former idea I would heartily endorse; can<br/>additional choices ever be bad?</p><p>Again, I do not dispute that dissonance is an integral part of some<br/>music.  Sometimes it should not be diminished at all.  (Interestingly,<br/>the application of adaptive techniques to very dissonant music such<br/>as Stravinski&apos;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; can substantially SHARPEN the<br/>dissonance at certain points, though not, one could argue, at the points<br/>necessarily chosen by the composer!)</p><p>But there&apos;s a LOT of music that is, IMHO, made more sweet and more<br/>powerful by the application of dynamic tuning.  To some ears, at least,<br/>certainly including mine!  Anyone who prefers Mozart (say) in 12-tET<br/>or in some other tuning has my blessing.  We were not born the same.</p><p>[Kraig Grady wrote:]<br/>&gt;D.Stearns and co.!<br/>&gt;    Yes as Carl Jung pointed out, there is no life without tension.<br/>&gt;without it in music the experience of cadence would not be possible or<br/>&gt;necessary!<br/>&gt;    It seems the greek notion of Orpheus was to get us into the<br/>&gt;underworld and get us out, even if he didn&apos;t necessarily make it<br/>&gt;himself. On the otherhand the notion and possibility of music acting<br/>&gt;upon the individual in a &quot;healing &quot; fashion is not new and one would<br/>&gt;expect to continue to function in this way in our society. The release<br/>&gt;of stress may not be the best way, in my own case I find that happy<br/>&gt;music makes me depressed and sad minor upon minor has an uncanny<br/>&gt;effect of lifting my spirits. I am not sure if the latter is just a<br/>&gt;release of the stress of sadness that its expression alleviates or not!</p><p>Do you prefer the Bach in 12-tET than in 5-limit adaptive grounded to<br/>COFT?  How about the Mozart?  Certainly in the music itself the process<br/>of stress and resolution from stress is played out many times; it is in<br/>the bones of the notes themselves.  Are you saying that a more<br/>dissonant tuning helps you enjoy the music?</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=10425 href="#10425">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2000 8:12:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I have no real interest in 5 limit tunings under 17 tones</p><p>Kraig!</p><p>You should try John&apos;s midi files out...</p><p><a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p><p>...he&apos;s rendering Mozart, Brahms, Bach, Schubert, etc, in 5- and 7-limit<br/>tunings with literally hundreds of notes each.
