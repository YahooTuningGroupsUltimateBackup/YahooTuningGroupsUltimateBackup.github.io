In the course of our discussion, I made a<br/>suggestion concerning the nomenclature of commas that we adopted.<br/>This will be included in the 17-tone article that will be appearing<br/>in the next issue of Xenharmonikon (#18), and is as follows:</p><p>&lt;&lt; The two different sizes of whole tone [9:8 and 8:7 in Archytas&apos;<br/>diatonic scale] differ in size by 63:64 (27 cents), which Alexander<br/>Ellis referred to as the septimal comma.  Ptolemy listed Archytas&apos;<br/>diatonic tuning as the diatonic toniaion, from which we might be a<br/>little hesitant to coin the term toniaic comma.  Instead, I believe<br/>it would be fitting to honor the originator of this scale by calling<br/>this Archytas&apos; comma.  (For many years I have felt that the use of<br/>the names Pythagoras and Didymus in association with their respective<br/>commas is a clearer and more memorable way of identifying them than<br/>the adjectives ditonic and syntonic, which only a scholar could<br/>love.  Confusion between these two terms can happen to the best of<br/>us:  Even as knowledgeable an authority as J. Murray Barbour slipped<br/>up in this regard in the beginning of the first chapter of his book,<br/>Tuning and Temperament. &gt;&gt;</p><p>With our discussion of commas fresh in my mind, I happened to come<br/>across a couple of papers on which I had sketched out the expanded<br/>saggital symbols, and I began to see a connection between the two<br/>that led to the idea of using the saggital symbols, not only for<br/>systems other than 72-EDO, but also as a transcendental notation.</p><p>*Didymus and Archytas*</p><p>In the first part of the presentation I mentioned a distinction<br/>between *native* (or EDO-specific) and *transcendental* (or EDO-trans-<br/>generic) applications of the saggital notation.  As a general<br/>principle, a composition of even moderate complexity written for a<br/>specific EDO could not be expected to be directly transferable into<br/>another EDO, and it would be appropriate to employ a native (or<br/>system-specific) notation for this purpose.  However, it would be<br/>highly desirable for the symbols used in a system-specific notation<br/>to be selected from a master superset of symbols.  An analogy from<br/>written language would help to illustrate this point.</p><p>It is more difficult for those whose native language is English to<br/>learn to read a language that uses a different alphabet or set of<br/>symbols different from the Roman alphabet (e.g., Hebrew, Arabic,<br/>Chinese, or Japanese) than one that uses essentially the same<br/>alphabet (e.g., Spanish, French, or German).  For the same reason it<br/>is better, if at all possible, to use a single unified set of symbols<br/>for many EDO&apos;s, rather than different symbols for different EDO&apos;s Â–<br/>provided that each symbol were to have the same meaning across all<br/>(or at least most) of those EDO&apos;s, just as specific vowels and<br/>consonants in the Roman alphabet represent similar (but not<br/>identical) sounds in the various European languages that employ them.</p><p>The fundamental principle that sets the saggital notation apart from<br/>other systems is as follows:</p><p>&#x9;Whereas other systems of notation use symbols to represent<br/>alteration in pitch in terms of specific numbers of system degrees or<br/>specific fractions of a sharp or flat, the saggital symbols<br/>represents alterations in pitch by using symbols to represent<br/>alterations *by approximations of certain superparticular ratios*,<br/>namely Didymus&apos; comma (81:80), Archytas&apos; comma (64:63), and the<br/>unidecimal diesis (33:32).</p><p>As before, the figures for this presentation are in:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/figures.bmp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/figures.bmp</a></p><p>Reference to the expanded saggital symbols in the third row of Figure<br/>3 will serve to illustrate this fundamental principle.  Immediately<br/>to the left of the natural sign is a symbol with a stem with a left<br/>flag, \|.  In 72-EDO this would represent one degree down, but in the<br/>saggital notation this actually represents a Didymus-comma-down<br/>(80:81), which just happens to be one degree of 72-EDO.  The next<br/>symbol to the left is a stem with a right flag, |/.  Specific to 72-<br/>EDO this would represent two degrees down, but in the saggital<br/>notation this represents an Archytus-comma-down (63:64).  The next<br/>symbol to the left combines these in a single-headed arrow with both<br/>left and right flags, \|/, symbolizing a unidecimal-diesis-down<br/>(32:33).  For those interested in the numbers, observe the following<br/>interval arithmetic (in which it should be understood that plus and<br/>minus symbols actually indicate multiplication and division of the<br/>numerical ratios):</p><p> Unidecimal diesis Â– (Archytus&apos; comma + Didymus&apos; comma) = 4.503 cents</p><p> 33/32 Â– (64/63 + 81/80) = 385/384, or 4.503 cents</p><p>Those in the tuning-math group will immediately recognize this as a<br/>zero vector encountered in their exploration of the Miracle tuning,<br/>perhaps more recognizable as the difference between just intervals<br/>represented by certain basic intervals in that tuning:</p><p> (3 secors) Â– (2 secors + 1 secor) = a zero vector</p><p> 11/9 Â– {8/7 + 16/15) = 385/384, or 4.503 cents</p><p>This serves to demonstrate not only the close relationship of the<br/>saggital notation to the Miracle tuning geometry, but also to point<br/>out that the power and versatility of the saggital symbols is drawn<br/>from the very same geometry that gives the Miracle tuning its<br/>versatility and efficiency, so it would not be inappropriate to call<br/>this a Miracle notation.  But first let&apos;s see if it accomplishes any<br/>miracles.</p><p>As we noted, in 72-EDO Didymus&apos; comma is 1 degree and Archytus&apos; comma<br/>is two degrees.  In 41-EDO, these are each one degree, while in 31-<br/>EDO they are zero degrees and one degree, respectively.  Now look at<br/>any saggital symbol in the third of figure 3; the number of degrees<br/>of alteration accomplished by that symbol in a given EDO is found by<br/>totaling the number of degrees represented by Didymus (left) and<br/>Archytas (right) flags in the symbol for that EDO.  That&apos;s how it&apos;s<br/>done, plain and simple!  And this principle can also be used to<br/>notate many other EDO&apos;s as well.</p><p>Just as a certain vowel symbolized by a letter of the alphabet is<br/>pronounced somewhat differently from one spoken language to another,<br/>so does a Didymus-comma-down symbol, for example, lower the pitch by<br/>different amounts in different EDO&apos;s.  In the case of systems that<br/>disperse Didymus&apos; comma, such as 24 or 31-EDO, the Didymus-comma-down<br/>symbol will indicate an alteration of zero degrees, so that the left<br/>flags in the expanded saggital symbols are disregarded in these<br/>systems.</p><p>It is obvious that nobody is going to take the time or trouble to<br/>count flags, which is why the compact saggital symbols were<br/>developed.  These contain all of the information conveyed by the<br/>expanded symbols in a simpler form.  Each of the compact symbols can<br/>be readily identified as having a Didymus (left-handed), Archytas<br/>(right-handed), or diesis (laterally symmetrical) appearance and<br/>function.</p><p>*Native vs. Transcendental*</p><p>It was noted above that compositions written for one EDO are not<br/>generally transferable into another EDO.  However, there are<br/>circumstances under which such transference is not only possible, but<br/>highly desirable and practical.  For example, music written in the<br/>Blackjack or Canasta scales (~72-EDO) could easily be played on wind<br/>instruments (with relatively small amounts of pitch-bending)<br/>specifically built for 31 or 41-EDO, and the result would be far<br/>better than using 12-EDO instruments with extended (or extraordinary)<br/>techniques.  (I believe that 72-EDO wind instruments are a bit out of<br/>the question for the foreseeable future, if ever.)  Another example<br/>would be just intonation (e.g., the 43-tone Partch set) mapped onto<br/>72 and played on 31 or (for Partch, preferably) 41-EDO instruments.<br/>(I have to assume that, should microtonality go mainstream, we would<br/>no longer want to suffer the limitations of 12-EDO instruments, and<br/>whatever notation we might use should take this into account.  It<br/>never hurts to plan ahead!)  In these instances the 72-tone notation<br/>could be employed as a transcendental notation that could be read<br/>directly into 31 or 41, making it unnecessary to have separate parts<br/>for instruments in each of those systems.  This would remove a<br/>considerable burden from the composer, who might not know in advance<br/>what instruments would eventually be used to perform a given<br/>composition.</p><p>The saggital notation accomplishes this by a principle similar to the<br/>way decimal numbers are rounded off to whole numbers, as illustrated<br/>in Figure 4.  In native 31-EDO notation, all symbols are multiples of<br/>a single diesis.  (As it happens, in all three EDO&apos;s Â– 31, 41, and<br/>72 Â– three 5:4&apos;s fall short of an octave by the number of degrees<br/>representing 33:32 in each of those systems, so the term &quot;diesis&quot; can<br/>be used here in a broader sense to refer to either the unidecimal or<br/>meantone diesis.)  Each left or right-handed symbol in the<br/>transcendental notation may be regarded as an alteration of the<br/>neighboring symmetical symbol by a Didymus flag that represents<br/>81:80, which is a zero vector in 31-EDO.  (The left-handed symbols<br/>are thus interpreted as a symmetrical symbol plus Didymus flag, while<br/>right-handed symbols are interpreted as a symmetrical symbol minus a<br/>Didymus flag.)  The small arrows in the figure show how<br/>mental &quot;rounding&quot; to the nearest diesis can be accomplished.</p><p>In the 41-EDO native notation some new symbols are required to<br/>indicate odd-number multiples of a half-diesis (i.e., quarter-sharp<br/>and quarter-flat) alteration.  It should be evident that<br/>mental &quot;rounding&quot; (to the nearest half-diesis) is even simpler than<br/>what is required in 31-EDO.</p><p>This process of mental rounding works in this fashion with almost all<br/>simple 11-limit ratios, and the exceptions are easy to remember: the<br/>few ratios having a 7 factor in the numerator and a 5 factor in the<br/>denominator (or vice versa) Â– 7/5, 10/7, 21/20, 40/21 Â– must be duly<br/>noted and memorized.  As far as I have been able to tell, most<br/>everything else works like a charm!</p><p>For your reference, there is a one-octave diagram of 72-EDO (with<br/>numbered system degrees and saggital symbols) compared with 19-limit<br/>just intonation at:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/72vsJI.bmp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/72vsJI.bmp</a></p><p>The next part of this presentation will continue with application of<br/>the saggital notation to some other EDO&apos;s.</p><p>And your questions and comments will be appreciated.</p><p>Until next time, please stay tuned!</p><p>--George</p><p>Love / joy / peace / patience Â…</p></div><h3><a id=33307 href="#33307">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2002 1:13:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Over on tuning-math, Paul has told us that my curious and technical definition of what I call a &quot;notation&quot; is unlike any notation anyone has ever actually seen or spoken of, and since it is abstract there&apos;s some truth in that. However, I see that saggital notation is also a &quot;notation&quot; in my sense--specifically, it seems to be a notation for the 11-limit temperament with the single comma 225/224, and hence can be used, if not for absolutely everthing, then certainly for any system in which 225/224 is a unison and no primes higher than 11 are represented, and that covers a lot of ground.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &#x9;Whereas other systems of notation use symbols to represent<br/>&gt; alteration in pitch in terms of specific numbers of system degrees or<br/>&gt; specific fractions of a sharp or flat, the saggital symbols<br/>&gt; represents alterations in pitch by using symbols to represent<br/>&gt; alterations *by approximations of certain superparticular ratios*,<br/>&gt; namely Didymus&apos; comma (81:80), Archytas&apos; comma (64:63), and the<br/>&gt; unidecimal diesis (33:32).</p><p>Implicit in all of this, if I understand correctly, is also a count of semitones. Hence I presume 16/15 and 15/14 should be added to the mix, and the two equated. We could then expand saggital by adding a symbol for 225/224, making it into a complete 11-limit notation. We then have:</p><p>&lt;81/80, 64/63, 33/32, 16/15, 15/14&gt;^(-1) =</p><p>[-h2, -g5, v11, h7, h5]</p><p>Here h2, h5 and h7 are the standard 2, 5, and 7-et maps, g5 is a nonstandard 5-et map [5,8,12,15,17], and v11 is the 11-adic valuation,<br/>meaning the map which sends 11 to 1 and everything else to 0. This amounts to a proof saggital notation works under the conditions I stated, and a recipe for calculating how any particular 11-limit<br/>interval should be notated. Note that if 225/224~1 we can conflate<br/>h5 and h7 into h5+h7=g12. I also would like to draw Joe Monzo&apos;s attention to the similarity between saggital and his analysis of Schoenberg.</p></div><h3><a id=33310 href="#33310">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2002 1:51:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Over on tuning-math, Paul has told us that my curious and technical<br/>&gt;definition of what I call a &quot;notation&quot; is unlike any notation anyone<br/>&gt;has ever actually seen or spoken of, and since it is abstract<br/>&gt;there&apos;s some truth in that.</p><p>Probably my understanding was limited to the case of Monz&apos;s<br/>Schoenberg-PB query.</p><p>&gt;However, I see that saggital notation is &gt;also a &quot;notation&quot; in my<br/>&gt;sense--specifically, it seems to be a &gt;notation for the 11-limit<br/>&gt;temperament with the single comma 225/224, &gt;and hence can be used,<br/>&gt;if not for absolutely everthing, then &gt;certainly for any system in<br/>&gt;which 225/224 is a unison and no primes &gt;higher than 11 are<br/>&gt;represented, and that covers a lot of ground.</p><p>Rami Vitale was very unhappy with the idea of 225:224 vanishing, for<br/>his JI presentation of Byzantine scales.

In 41-EDO, these are each one degree, while in 31-<br/>&gt; EDO they are zero degrees and one degree, respectively.  Now look at<br/>&gt; any saggital symbol in the third of figure 3; the number of degrees<br/>&gt; of alteration accomplished by that symbol in a given EDO is found by<br/>&gt; totaling the number of degrees represented by Didymus (left) and<br/>&gt; Archytas (right) flags in the symbol for that EDO.  That&apos;s how it&apos;s<br/>&gt; done, plain and simple!  And this principle can also be used to<br/>&gt; notate many other EDO&apos;s as well.</p><p>That means Archytas&apos; comma is a miracle &quot;quomma&quot; or the difference between<br/>10 secors and an octave.  Didymus&apos; comma is the difference between 3<br/>quommas and a secor.  I think George is suggesting that these be<br/>differentiated in a 72-equal notation, to make it miracle-unique.</p><p>That&apos;s like adding &quot;diesis&quot; symbols to meantone, and then differentiating<br/>31-equal equivalences.  So C-Bbv is 7:4 but not A#.  Hence the one-to-one<br/>mapping between saggital and Couper/Tartini notation with added commas.<br/>Or something like that.</p><p>&gt; For example, music written in the<br/>&gt; Blackjack or Canasta scales (~72-EDO) could easily be played on wind<br/>&gt; instruments (with relatively small amounts of pitch-bending)<br/>&gt; specifically built for 31 or 41-EDO, and the result would be far<br/>&gt; better than using 12-EDO instruments with extended (or extraordinary)<br/>&gt; techniques.</p><p>Note the bit about pitch bending there.  Some commentators seem to have<br/>missed it.</p><p>&gt; In the 41-EDO native notation some new symbols are required to<br/>&gt; indicate odd-number multiples of a half-diesis (i.e., quarter-sharp<br/>&gt; and quarter-flat) alteration.  It should be evident that<br/>&gt; mental &quot;rounding&quot; (to the nearest half-diesis) is even simpler than<br/>&gt; what is required in 31-EDO.</p><p>Oh.

Although I have good reason to believe from my<br/>private communication with John Chalmers that I would have no problem<br/>getting my article into XH 18, he hasn&apos;t accepted it yet because I<br/>haven&apos;t sent it yet, since I will be sending another article along<br/>with it that hasn&apos;t yet been completed.  So I should change &quot;will be<br/>appearing&quot; to &quot;will probably be appearing&quot;.  (My apologies, John, if<br/>you happen to see this.)</p><p>&gt; [GS:]<br/>&gt; &#x9;Whereas other systems of notation use symbols to represent<br/>&gt; alteration in pitch in terms of specific numbers of system degrees<br/>or<br/>&gt; specific fractions of a sharp or flat, the saggital symbols<br/>&gt; represents alterations in pitch by using symbols to represent<br/>&gt; alterations *by approximations of certain superparticular ratios*,<br/>&gt; namely Didymus&apos; comma (81:80), Archytas&apos; comma (64:63), and the<br/>&gt; unidecimal diesis (33:32).</p><p>[PE:]<br/>&lt;&lt; And the naturals represent Pythagorean? Please remind me. &gt;&gt;</p><p>The naturals represent tones in a series of fifths of indefinite<br/>size, which means that they can be used to represent whatever you<br/>want them to (within reason), just as our conventional notation can<br/>represent Pythagorean, meantone, or 12-EDO.  (But the tuning-math<br/>group, having a different purpose in mind, may be looking for a<br/>different answer to this question, which I will address later in this<br/>message.)</p><p>There also seems to have been some confusion regarding how many<br/>nominals are in this notation: 7 or 12 (there are 7), and whether a<br/>chain of fifths forms a 12-tone circle or a series.  Again, as with<br/>conventional notation, you can have it as either a circle (of 12 or<br/>some other number) or a series, just as conventional notation can be<br/>used for a circle of 12 (equal or unequal), a circle of 19 (equal or<br/>unequal), or a meantone or Pythagorean series.

The symbols have a lot of<br/>information packed into them that can be interpreted in several<br/>different ways, and they can be used for a lot of different tunings,<br/>so it will take some time to get comfortable with them.  Remember<br/>that I said that there are some things about this notation that took<br/>me months to see, even though I&apos;m the one who came up with it.<br/>That&apos;s why I&apos;m more inclined to use the word &quot;discovered&quot;<br/>than &quot;devised&quot; for what I did.  And I expect that I will be learning<br/>even more about it in the next several months, inasmuch as Margo and<br/>I have recently been giving it a test-drive over some less-frequented<br/>EDO&apos;s to see how well it handles off the beaten path.  (So far I<br/>haven&apos;t been disappointed.)</p><p>As you noted, there are more symbols to learn than with the Sims<br/>notation, so there is no question in my mind that you are going to<br/>get quicker results with that than with the saggital notation.  On<br/>the other hand, since a multi-system notation is capable of so much<br/>more than one for a single system, the saggital notation would, in<br/>the long run, provide a greater return on investment of one&apos;s time<br/>and effort.</p><p>By the way, in case you want to print out that full-octave diagram of<br/>72-EDO on a single 8.5 x 11 page, go to the following and print it.<br/>(It looked awful on my screen but printed very nicely when I tried<br/>it.)</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/72vsJI.doc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/72vsJI.doc</a></p><p>[Re:  Saggital notation as a &quot;notation&quot;  (several postings by Gene<br/>Ward Smith beginning with #33307, including replies by Paul Erlich)]</p><p>Just one comment: I did notice a 22-tone system mentioned (#33320).<br/>This is one octave division with which I am very familiar<br/>(particularly the EDO), and I intend to cover the application of the<br/>saggital notation to 22 in some detail in the next part of the<br/>presentation.</p><p>[Re:  13-limit Saggital?  (several postings by Gene Ward Smith<br/>beginning with #33330, including replies by Paul Erlich)]</p><p>Up to this point I have been too busy with other things to be seduced<br/>into a love affair with the math, but it looks as if you&apos;re doing<br/>your best to lead me into temptation, so let me throw my two cents in<br/>here, for what it&apos;s worth.</p><p>For the purpose of notating rational intervals, the saggital notation<br/>begins with 7 nominals in a Pythagorean (or 3-limit) series, i.e.,<br/>the naturals from F to B.  (This excludes 12-tone enharmonic<br/>equivalence.)  Introduction of symbols for 81/80, 64/63, and 33/32<br/>gives you additional tones related by primes 5, 7, and 11,<br/>respectively.  (I have not delved deeply enough into all of this to<br/>see why you need both 25/24 and 16/15 as defining intervals, but I<br/>assume you know what you&apos;re doing and will just have to do more<br/>reading to see why.)</p><p>In going to the 13 limit you have added 39/40 (40/39?).  Considering<br/>that each of the primes (5, 7, and 11) were introduced with ratios<br/>containing no other primes above 3, would it not be more advisable<br/>(or &quot;cleaner&quot;) to use 27/26 or 13/12 instead?</p><p>Personally, I consider ratios of 13 indispensable and would be very<br/>interested to see where this leads.  My method for successfully<br/>incorporating 13 into a tonal system is probably a little different<br/>from what most others have tried, but I have found that the saggital<br/>notation (as I have presented it) works extremely well for my<br/>purposes.  (My approach to 13 will need to be presented in a couple<br/>of *Buried Treasure* articles.)</p><p>[Dave Keenan (#33346):]</p><p>&lt;&lt; There are really two different aspects to this system that one can<br/>take or leave independently. I&apos;ll call them semantic and syntactic<br/>(or symbolic).</p><p>I haven&apos;t fully understood the semantics of it since so far I&apos;ve only<br/>read the messages thru once quickly, but I&apos;ve failed to understand<br/>how one decides which notes in any given system get to be the 7<br/>naturals. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Unless I don&apos;t understand the question, or there is something here<br/>that I&apos;m missing, I thought that it would be obvious that they were<br/>the tones in a series of fifths from F to B, just as we presently<br/>have.  If you have a tonal system in which reasonable approximations<br/>of perfect fifths don&apos;t exist, e.g., 8, 11, 13, or 23-EDO, then you<br/>can notate them as subsets of 72, 22, 26, and 46-EDO, respectively.</p><p>&lt;&lt; WRT the symbolic level, it is indeed ingenious and logical but I<br/>suspect it is doomed because it is bad for rapid sight reading<br/>without error. The ability to recognise the difference between left<br/>and right reflections of the same symbol, and the ability to tell a<br/>triple something from a double at a glance, are late developing in<br/>childhood relative to other symbol recognition tasks. Some Australian<br/>aboriginal languages have no separate word for three or any exact<br/>larger numbers. There just hasn&apos;t been the need for these sorts of<br/>recognition abilities except in relatively recent human cultures. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Would rapid reading of something that&apos;s dackwarbs in this sentence<br/>cause you to miss it?  I realize that mirrored notation is not<br/>exactly the same thing as mirrored letters in the alphabet, but my<br/>point is that every symbol has a context, and just as it is fairly<br/>easy for most of us to spot a wrong note in tonal music, I don&apos;t<br/>think that it&apos;s going to be as difficult as you suggest.  (I&apos;m sure<br/>that many of us have heard music that is so unintelligible that it<br/>wouldn&apos;t have mattered much whether anyone played any &quot;wrong&quot; notes<br/>or not, but that&apos;s another issue entirely.)</p><p>As for exposing children to microtonal notation, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re<br/>going to expect children to handle more than 31 tones per octave (if<br/>even that many).  That being the case, I can&apos;t think of a single<br/>example of an EDO of less than 32 tones per octave that uses any<br/>saggital symbols that are mirrors of each other.  While a couple of<br/>them do use some left-handed and right-handed symbols (22 and 29-<br/>EDO), none of those in the applicable subset mirror each other, so I<br/>think this is not really an issue.</p><p>Likewise, I think that three of something is pretty easy to<br/>distinguish from two, but when it comes to four vs. three, I found<br/>that the difference is not perceived as easily, which is why I chose<br/>an X for the double sharp and double flat symbols.  So I am in<br/>partial agreement with you on this point.</p><p>&lt;&lt; I suggest that this means that such recognition tasks are of a<br/>higher order than others and will always take more time to be<br/>processed. This of course argues against the Tartini/Couper<br/>accidentals too. But in favour of the Sims, and against the ASCII-<br/>fied Sims.</p><p>So dare I suggest these rules for optimal accidental symbols for<br/>sight reading:</p><p>One shouldn&apos;t need to be able to tell left from right.<br/>One shouldn&apos;t need to &quot;count&quot; past two.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>All seriousness aside, you&apos;re free to suggest whatever you want, but<br/>then dare I suggest that we ban triple meter and get rid of all the<br/>instruments that would require music students to move both hands (or<br/>fingers thereof) at once in different ways?

A very simple solution with the saggital symbols is<br/>to make them larger in the individual parts so that they can be<br/>easily read from a distance.  (On the score or for keyboard music<br/>they can be the ordinary size.)  This may look a little ugly, but the<br/>Sims notation isn&apos;t about to win any beauty contests either, and the<br/>one-note-at-a-time (or at most two) nature of an orchestral part<br/>isn&apos;t going to create any real clutter or confusion.</p><p>Now if the goal is to get results from the players as quickly and<br/>easily as possible, then an approach that minimizes the learning<br/>curve (with the fewest new symbols) is to be preferred, and the Sims<br/>notation wins, hands down.  I would consider this an example of<br/>a &quot;quick and dirty fix,&quot; or something that requires the least amount<br/>of effort to do the job.  In connection with this, also see Joseph<br/>Pehrson&apos;s posting (#27626) regarding an article on the Sims notation<br/>from Xenharmonikon XI, particularly the two paragraphs near the end<br/>which quote Sims directly:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_27626.html#27626">/tuning/topicId_27626.html#27626</a></p><p>If, on the other hand, we want the notation to be useful for as many<br/>tonal systems as possible (and also allow for the possibility that<br/>new instruments may be used), then we are talking about an entirely<br/>different philosophy of microtonality, one which is going to take<br/>more effort to learn, but which will pay more dividends in the end.<br/>To get the right answers, you need to ask the right questions;<br/>likewise, to select the proper notation, you need to identify your<br/>objective.  This, I think, is the real issue, and I believe that many<br/>of us who are dedicated to the approach to microtonality that finds<br/>new consonant harmonies by using higher prime numbers will affirm<br/>that one of the great strengths of our movement has been our<br/>inclusiveness and diversity.</p><p>Am I making any sense?</p><p>[Dave Keenan (#33362):]</p><p>&lt;&lt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>George,</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I have so little time to spend understanding your notation<br/>at this time.

I&apos;m sure you&apos;d agree that, similarly, a Decimal-based<br/>interval naming scheme would come out more elegant for MIRACLE, and<br/>perhaps you&apos;d agree that it could lead a composer to more<br/>indigenously MIRACLEian ways of thinking and composing, since all but<br/>one of the unison vectors are already dealt with in the notation<br/>(yes, I&apos;m arguing for Decimal notation here, and of course Decimal-<br/>based interval naming to go along with it).</p><p>Unfortunately, we have the consideration that most _performers_ will<br/>have no idea what such notation systems represent.

Lately I&apos;ve been re-examining Paul Erlich&apos;s pajara<br/>scale system, and I&apos;ve become curious about the origin of the<br/>name &quot;pajara&quot;.  A search turned up the following message:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_33306.html#33368">/tuning/topicId_33306.html#33368</a><br/>to which I&apos;m replying now, because there&apos;s something in it that I<br/>don&apos;t follow:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 225:224 vanishes in paultone.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s gone back to being paultone?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK, twintone<br/>&gt; &gt; (but what do we call double-diatonic, as in 26-tET,<br/>&gt; &gt; where 50:49 and 81:80 are tempered out, but 64:63 isn&apos;t?
