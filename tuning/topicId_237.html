For those of you who don&apos;t<br/>know, Ralph Jarzombek has six pieces of 14tet here:<br/><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/53/ralph_jarzombek.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/53/ralph_jarzombek.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=272 href="#272">ðŸ”—</a>rick@...</h3><span>7/10/2001 11:13:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>XED wrote:</p><p>&gt; Everyone owes a debt of gratitude to George Zelenz and Rick<br/>&gt; (last name?) and Margo Schulter and Mary Ackeley for their continuing<br/>&gt; posts of splendid music.</p><p>Thanks... I hope you&apos;re talking about me, Rick.  The last name is McGowan.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I made an MP3 of an old 14-tET piece.  This is<br/>a 1989 recording of a waltz scene, track 16, from one of my ballets.  (This<br/>morning I noticed that this ballet actually contains two pieces in 14-tET;<br/>this is one of them.)  The recording isn&apos;t great -- was taken from a<br/>ten-year-old cassette master tape through a not-so-hi-fi connection.  You can<br/>audition this 2.8MB file for a limited time only at:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/CSPB-16.mp3">http://rm-and-jo.laughingsquid.org/CSPB-16.mp3</a></p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
