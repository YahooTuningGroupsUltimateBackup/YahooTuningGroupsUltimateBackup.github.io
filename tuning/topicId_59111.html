I don&apos;t understand your requirements well<br/>  enough<br/>  &gt; &gt; to see why 79 appeals to you.  While it is a sort of meantone<br/>  tuning,<br/>  &gt; &gt; its best 4:5 is not arrived at by a chain of 4 fifths.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; It&apos;s not 79, it&apos;s 159. 79 is a MOS.</p><p>  If the generator is 92deg159, then your best 4:5 is -15 generators<br/>  along the chain, not +4.  However, if you wanted to consider the<br/>  tones separated by 19 generators as simply subtle variations of the<br/>  same notated pitch, then a 19-ET notation (with no new microtonal<br/>  symbols) would suffice.  (But I think Ozan needs more than 19<br/>  pitches/octave.)</p><p>  &gt; &gt; You expressed an interest in 31-ET, and also in flexible<br/>  intonation<br/>  &gt; &gt; and ratios of 7 (as I infer from your &quot;superpythagorean&quot;<br/>  comment.<br/>  &gt; &gt; Since 31 represents both 4:5 and 4:7 extremely well, is 11-limit<br/>  &gt; &gt; consistent, and is also one of the very best meantones available,<br/>  &gt; &gt; would you be interested in some sort of adaptive JI based on 217-<br/>  ET,<br/>  &gt; &gt; a multiple of 31?<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; That would work, but it&apos;s got more notes in it that 159.</p><p>  It depends on how you look at it.  I was thinking that this is really<br/>  only 31 pitches/octave, with subtle variations in intonation that<br/>  could be indicated with little arrows that would guide students to<br/>  the desired pitch, but which Maqam masters would be free to<br/>  disregard, at their own discretion.  You would never even come close<br/>  to using all 217 pitches, because you would only be modulating around<br/>  a circle of 31 (meantone) fifths.</p><p>  &gt; If you are<br/>  &gt; going to take a multiple of a meantone system, the claims of 152 and<br/>  &gt; 171 should be considered,</p><p>  Yes, and as I pointed out, I don&apos;t expect that 19 pitches +<br/>  flexibility will be enough.  Hmmm, now that I&apos;ve said that, what<br/>  about two circles of 19?  38-ET would use the same Tartini<br/>  accidentals as 31-ET.  All of the pitches of 152-ET can be arrived at<br/>  by increments up to +-2deg152, and there would be only 5 different<br/>  choices of pitch adjustment: down-large, down-small, none, up-small,<br/>  and up-large.  Sagittal also has two small arrows for those, the<br/>  first two in the 152 row of Figure 9 of the Sagittal paper: the<br/>  smaller )|( is symmetrical, the larger )|~ assymetrical.  The<br/>  Sagittal paper:<br/>  <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>  also contains a footnote (#16 on page 20) suggesting that instruments<br/>  in 19, 31, or 38-ET could easily be used for JI, so this idea has<br/>  been around for at least a few years.</p><p>  &gt; but Ozan seems to find more interest in<br/>  &gt; multiples of 53.</p><p>  Okay, hold on a minute -- there&apos;s a connection to be made.</p><p>  I believe you asked how Dave and I would notate 159.  Scala will show<br/>  you if you enter &quot;set nota sa159&quot;.</p><p>  The first 7 symbols in the set:<br/>  159:  |(  ~|(  /|  |)  (|(  //|  /|\  (|)  )||(  ~||(  ||)  ||\  (||<br/>  (  /||)  /||\<br/>  represent the best approximations of 5:7k (5103:5120), 17C<br/>  (4096:4131), 5C (80:81), 7C (63:64), 5:11S (44:45), 25C (6400:6561),<br/>  and 11M (32:33), respectively.  The remaining symbols are their<br/>  apotome-complements.</p><p>  But those are alterations to a chain of nominals generated by the<br/>  best fifth of 159.  I think Ozan may want a notation that uses<br/>  nominals generated by a 159-meantone fifth (one degree smaller),<br/>  which would be something quite different.  Gene, have you considered<br/>  looking at this as a chain of semi-159-meantone-fifths (46deg159)?<br/>  That&apos;s similar enough to 38-as-subset-of-152-ET that a chain of 38<br/>  tones could be notated with the Tartini symbols and fine-tuned as<br/>  increments +-2deg159.</p><p>  --George</p><p>  You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>  of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  Yahoo!

You won&apos;t be able to go beyond 57, because &quot;set nota<br/>sa76&quot; will notate the pitches as a subset of 152 (using its best<br/>fifth); &quot;set nota sa76n&quot;, although technically possible, isn&apos;t<br/>implemented, because we judged a native-fifth 76-ET notation so<br/>contorted as to be almost worthless.</p><p>Anyway, you should be able to see from the above that the meantone-<br/>159 apotome is 8 degrees and that you&apos;ll need 7 symbols between the<br/>natural and sharp to notate all of those (although your MOS may<br/>require less).  (This is not a lot, considering that 159-ET notation<br/>based on its best fifth requires 14 symbols between the natural and<br/>sharp.)</p><p>--George</p></div>
