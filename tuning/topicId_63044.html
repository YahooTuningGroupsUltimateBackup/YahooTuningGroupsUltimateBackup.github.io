The tritone is THE<br/>&gt; MOST SPECIFIC PROPERTY OF 12EDO (because it&apos;s an<br/>&gt; EVEN-NUMBERED EDO), and I haven&apos;t heard<br/>&gt; any alternative tuning system that can match it!</p><p>None of this argues that it is either especially pleasing or found in<br/>nature, except for the claim that you haven&apos;t found a tuning system to<br/>match 12-edo. But I suspect you&apos;ve not had enough experience with<br/>various systems of tuning to compare.</p><p>I also think the tritone is not the most specific property of 12-edo;<br/>22-edo, for instance, makes more of it, really. 12-edo has both a<br/>diminished seventh chord consisting of four stacked minor thirds, and<br/>an augmented triad consisting of three stacked major thirds. It has<br/>poor thirds because of these facts, however; but its fifths are good.<br/>I could go on about it but I don&apos;t see the tritone as very specfic to it.</p></div><h3><a id=63117 href="#63117">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2005 6:42:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Flavell&quot; &lt;bill_flavell@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; TO YOU, maybe! :) I&apos;ll take a 12EDO tritone<br/>&gt; and minor 3rd over any other alternative<br/>&gt; tuning&apos;scale I&apos;ve heard sio far! :)</p><p>But you don&apos;t seem to have heard any.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and by insisting on them you<br/>&gt; &gt; simply miss half the systems.

You yourself<br/>&gt; &gt; write jazz-influenced music in 22,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; True.</p><p>I wrote something here a few months back explaining my<br/>take on this: i think, despite the fact that &quot;blue notes&quot;<br/>are almost always considered to be intonationally closer<br/>to &quot;neutral&quot; undecimal (ratios-of-11) ratios than to<br/>septimal (ratios-of-7) ratios, the fact that *all* chords<br/>in blues are dominant-7th chords tends to make them seem<br/>like concordant 4:5:6:7 proportions, as opposed to the<br/>discordant sonorities which &quot;common-practice&quot; harmony<br/>expects dominant-7th chords to be.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and I think the sound of septimal harmony in general,<br/>&gt; &gt; including in 22, tends to sounds jazzy<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;in a more general sense than you seem to<br/>&gt; &gt; want to consider.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still, you can&apos;t open up the real book and expect a<br/>&gt; random jazz tune to work at all in 22. I guess that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what I meant, and I overstated the case.</p><p>I just wanted to point out for those who might not<br/>get it, that &quot;the real book&quot; refers to the _Real Book_,<br/>a &quot;fake book&quot; of all the greatest jazz standards which<br/>is used by every jazz musician i know.</p><p>(so my point is that, properly, the title should have<br/>been capitalized and underlined/italicized)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=63184 href="#63184">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2005 10:33:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul and Gene,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s certainly true that you won&apos;t find a neutral third<br/>&gt; &gt; in 22, and you *will* find it in 34, which in general is<br/>&gt; &gt; not notable for septimal harmony. Of course, it&apos;s also<br/>&gt; &gt; there in 31, which might be a good choice if we wanted<br/>&gt; &gt; to adapt something out of a book.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, as John Starrett found, 31 works much better for most<br/>&gt; jazz tunes than 34. It&apos;s that meantone-born, common-practice<br/>&gt; diatonic underpinning showing its head again.</p><p>Oh, i think it&apos;s more than that.</p><p>31-edo, besides being a meantone, and besides having<br/>&quot;neutral&quot; versions of all the &quot;imperfect&quot; intervals,<br/>also has good approximations of all the septimal<br/>intervals too.

Mainly because i like the simplicity of HEWM<br/>notation so much, i&apos;ve been using 72-edo in Tonescape<br/>to render versions of bluesy/jazzy music with what i<br/>think is pretty good success.</p><p>I&apos;ve recently been working on a Tonescape version of<br/>Bruce Springsteen&apos;s &quot;Jungleland&quot; in 72-edo. In this tune,<br/>Springsteen strikes the pose of the Jack-Kerouac-type<br/>hipster street-poet, and does a lot of what sounds like<br/>half-spoken/half-sung vocals, and i think i&apos;ve been quite<br/>successful in capturing that style in 72-edo.</p><p>One side note that&apos;s particularly interesting to my<br/>opening comments in this post: there are several places<br/>where Springsteen is singing in intervals very close<br/>to 31-edo!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
