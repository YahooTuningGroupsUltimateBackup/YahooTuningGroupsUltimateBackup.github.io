(Perhaps I will be able to check that myself<br/>&gt;&gt; when I get my Spectrogram up and running.)</p><p>Graham answered:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I said in the original message, there&apos;s a wide variation in pitch<br/>&gt; over small periods of time.  I think this is from 6:5 (definitely this<br/>&gt; time) to 9:7.  But, if you do the Fourier transform over a longer<br/>&gt; period of time, you see a constant but blurred trace.  The most<br/>&gt; intense frequencies in that blur are colored differently, and fairly<br/>&gt; consistently correspond to a 5:4.  Which is what we would have<br/>&gt; expected.  Looks like the ear does a similar thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;blurring&quot; would presumably be interpreted by the ear similarly to<br/>&gt; vibrato.  However, it is qualitatively different.  It looks like a<br/>&gt; fractal trace, rather than a sine wave.  I&apos;d like to hotwire a synth<br/>&gt; to emulate this.  Maybe over the weekend.  It must come from some<br/>&gt; feature of the vocal chords, and is present, to greater or lesser<br/>&gt; extent, in all the samples I&apos;ve analysed that don&apos;t replace it with<br/>&gt; gratuitous vibrato or portamento.  Not that I have any kind of<br/>&gt; statistically significant sample yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think this is an artifact of the measuring process, as it<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t present for synth generated sounds.</p><p>This sounds interesting, Graham. Hopefully, you will be able to explore<br/>further.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>Graham further noted that:</p><p>&gt; What happens is that the trace is relatively<br/>&gt; steady for a while, then wanders around a bit, and becomes steady<br/>&gt; again.  With the low third, it keeps hitting the same point when it&apos;s<br/>&gt; steady.  With the high third, I think there are three different steady<br/>&gt; regions.</p><p>This is interesting from the standpoint that the vocalization of the low 4:5<br/>third is clearly a &quot;representation&quot; of nature while the high third is not<br/>(as far as we know). Perhaps it suggests that I (like the choirs I heard<br/>during the last two days) have a a variety of &quot;preferred&quot; high thirds<br/>according to context.</p><p>&gt; Each is consistent, in that the average pitch is the same at<br/>&gt; the beginning and end of the region, but the regions are not<br/>&gt; consistent with each other.</p><p>Which example are you referring to here? The adjusting one? The point of<br/>that one, of course, is to show a difference at the beginning and the ending<br/>&quot;regions.&quot;</p><p>&gt; I think this is audible: I heard the<br/>&gt; pitch rising,</p><p>Okay, I guess you are talking about the &quot;adjusting&quot; third extracted from the<br/>example into which the fifth was introduced.</p><p>&gt; and the chord becoming more dissonant.  I think the<br/>&gt; computer showed the first region being 5:4,</p><p>Before the fifth entered, I presume.</p><p>&gt; the middle around the 400<br/>&gt; cents,</p><p>In tempered &quot;never-never land.&quot;</p><p>&gt; and I forget for the last one.  I don&apos;t have the trace open<br/>&gt; here to check.</p><p>Oh, no! This is the vital one. The Tuning LIst (at least me) awaits the<br/>revelation of the &quot;magic&quot; number.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One interesting thing is that the blurring is actually greater for the<br/>&gt; low third, only the peak is well defined.  With the high third, the<br/>&gt; pitch fluctuates over a smaller range, but without a clear center.</p><p>Sure sounds like I had something in mind. The question is: what??????</p><p>&gt;  At<br/>&gt; least that&apos;s how I saw it.  You can all check for yourselves.</p><p>I certainly hope I will be able to when I get my new software loaded.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>&gt;&gt; Divisions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each time slice in the readout is a discrete Fourier transform at that<br/>&gt; point.  This is equivalent to a Fourier series about some low<br/>&gt; fundamental.  So you get equal divisions of frequency space.  Each<br/>&gt; point is colored to show the intensities of that range of frequencies.<br/>&gt;  Now, as I was measuring the fundamentals, the width of those<br/>&gt; frequency ranges amounts to a few cents.  So I can tell the difference<br/>&gt; between a just and equal tempered major third, but can&apos;t tell whether<br/>&gt; the high third is really 24:19.</p><p>But......but.......but.......I can&apos;t wait to find out what I sang!!!!!!!!</p><p>I guess I&apos;ll just have to tune in for the next exciting episode of &quot;The High<br/>Third Performance.&quot; Don&apos;t you just love suspense????</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
