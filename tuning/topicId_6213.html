Unfortunately, I am not able to keep up the correspondance at the<br/>rate I had been. Furthermore, given my lack of software for creating<br/>sequences according to specific tunings, I have no convincing way to<br/>resolve our differences, or, putting it more scientifically, to test my<br/>hypotheses or perform experiments. I intend to carefully study your<br/>responses, and at some time in the future put my ideas forward in a more<br/>comprehensive way. Given some of the experiments I&apos;ve performed tonight<br/>with various tunings of chords on my guitar, I&apos;m beginning to suspect that<br/>correct (or natural, or best) intonation is much more flexible than I had<br/>previously thought, in that it seems to be even more dependent on harmonic<br/>context, including voicing, than I had considered.</p><p>On October 13th, I wrote:</p><p>&gt;I am looking for a notation program that uses standard notation but<br/>&gt;would let me specify the pitch of each note. I would like to specify<br/>&gt;pitches in cycles per second, and not just globally but also dynamically<br/>&gt;(so that sometimes within a score F might be one pitch and at other<br/>&gt;times some other pitch). I would also like to be able to specify pitches<br/>&gt;by &gt;means of a formula. For example, once the pitch of the root of a chord<br/>&gt;was &gt;specified, I woud like to be able to specify the pitches of the other<br/>&gt;notes &gt;relative to that of the root.</p><p>I had only a response or two to that post, back in the days before I set a<br/>fire by conjecturing that the altered scale is tuned with the prime numbers<br/>through 19. I still need some sort of software to do experiments and test<br/>my theories against others that are proposed. I don&apos;t own a synthesizer and<br/>the computer I have is (please don&apos;t laugh!) an ancient Mac IIci with 100<br/>MB of RAM and a 100-MB hard drive. Any suggestions? I know that many of you<br/>have created sequences that you have tuned and I&apos;m eager to do the same.<br/>Any suggestions?</p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p></div>
