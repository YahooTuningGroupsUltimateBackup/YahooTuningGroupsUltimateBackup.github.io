Just tuning programs, and applets. Also I&apos;ve not included ones that consist of applying pitch bends in a<br/>sequencer that isn&apos;t mainly designed for such work - list would get too long as nearly any sequencer has some kind of pitch bending<br/>capabilities, even if often it may involve tuning every single note. I&apos;ve listed all the ones that I know current members of these<br/>lists use - and only ones that are currently available.</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>Look under tuning programs</p><p>Been working hard on my Virtual Flower program recently. Soon to be released, maybe tomorrow - just taking a short break before the<br/>final stretch :-).</p><p>It will have a virtual flower screen saver with FTS midi clips - and you can use any other clips you like with it. Nothing else<br/>particularly microtonal about it, but in future I will probably be adding things of interest to members here. For instance it can<br/>currently be used to make 3D objects and view them from various angles - it mightn&apos;t take that much in the way of extra programming<br/>to extend this to four and five space dimensions so that one could look at the dekany and Eikosany in the same way.</p><p>3D lattices might also be possible with notes to click at the lattice points - it already can make a two dimensional hexagonal<br/>lattice of trees, flowers or objects. There&apos;s an option to sense which point in the VRML model has been clicked, which could perhaps<br/>be used to make sure one plays the correct note for each point in the lattice.</p><p>Other ideas too. VRML would probably be the best way of doing the solar system chord - it is pretty easy to do a 3D solar system in<br/>VRML and if nothing else, one could just play the solar system chord as a background clip and synchronise it with the motion of the<br/>planets just by starting it at the right place...</p><p>Hope you are all well, and more presently,</p><p>:-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=38862 href="#38862">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2002 3:29:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 3D lattices might also be possible with notes to click at the lattice points - it already can make a two dimensional hexagonal<br/>&gt; lattice of trees, flowers or objects.</p><p>A 2D hexagonal array of chords with a 3-et keyboard can do the<br/>5-limit, and a 3D cubic lattice with a 4-et keyboard the 7-limit; this could be very powerful and interesting in practice.</p></div>
