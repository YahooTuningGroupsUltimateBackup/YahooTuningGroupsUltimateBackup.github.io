Aristoxenos mentions that Eratocles had<br/>discussed the octave species (modes), without analysing them into<br/>tetrachords and pentachords. A late writer, Aristides Quintilianus,<br/>lists the harmonia he claimed Plato was referring to in The Republic and<br/>four of these, including the preferred Dorian and Phrygian, span the<br/>octave (the Dorian has a range of a major 9th) and the whole set spans<br/>an 11th (Winnington-Ingram, Mode in Ancient Greek Music).</p><p>Pythagoras is credited with bringing the tetrachordal framework 6:8:9:12<br/>from Babylon, where &quot;Pythagorean&quot; octave scales had been known since at<br/>least the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE.</p><p>The diatonic genus was considered the oldest genus in Greece and was<br/>assuredly borrowed from Babylon. The full chromatic scale was known in<br/>Babylon and the coastal Near East by 1800 BCE and the Greeks were in<br/>close cultural contact withe these civilizations (and with the<br/>Egyptians, though little is known of Egyptian music).</p><p>(Interestingly, I saw a program on PBS in San Diego last night on the<br/>discovery of mummies with European features (blond and red hair, etc.)<br/>in Turkestan, Western China. These date from the 2nd millennium BCE and<br/>are likely to be ancestral to the later Tochars, who mediated trade<br/>between China and the Near East along the Silk Road. (The Tochars spoke<br/>a language related to Celtic in the Indo-European family.) Thus it is<br/>even more likely that Babylonian tuning lore reached Western China,<br/>where the Ling Lun (Master of Music) claimed that he obtained the tuning<br/>of the Lu&quot; (bamboo tubes tuned to a chromatic cycle by fifths/fourths)<br/>from the voice of a Phoenix.)</p><p>As for scales with dissimilar tetrachords, Kraig is correct; the mixed<br/>modes reported by Ptolemy consisted of a diatonic upper tetrachord and a<br/>soft diatonic or chromatic one below. However, they are usually used in<br/>different modes than the standard Dorian which has the disjunctive tone<br/>between the two tetrachords.</p><p>--John</p></div>
