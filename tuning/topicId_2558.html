We were discussing the 11-limit &apos;neutral&apos; intervals,<br/>but the point here is about the &apos;5th&apos; that is &apos;off by a comma&apos;.<br/>I&apos;ve underlined the beginning of the releveant section<br/>(altho we&apos;ve also been talking about 11:9 here recently too):</p><p>[me, monz:]<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been playing around a lot with the 11/6 &apos;7th&apos;<br/>&gt; for about a year now.  When I use it, it functions<br/>&gt; to me like a &apos;major 7th&apos;, but it really is neutral.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And then, since my posting to TD 132 about that<br/>&gt; Etta James MIDI file, I&apos;ve realized that there are<br/>&gt; some really interesting 11-limit &apos;3rds&apos; and &apos;6ths&apos;,<br/>&gt; and that they quite typical of intervals in blues vocals.<br/>&gt; A prominent example from that &apos;article&apos; is 99/80.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously this is pretty close to a 5/4 [= 100/80].<br/>&gt; ~17.4 cents flatter, to be (almost) exact.<br/>&gt; Also, not quite as &apos;neutral&apos; as the typical 11-limit<br/>&gt; intervals which are very close to 1/4-tones, like<br/>&gt; 11/8 and 11/6, and your &apos;neutral 3rd&apos; of 11/9.<br/>&gt; It leans a tiny bit toward the &apos;major&apos; side of &apos;3rd&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the other day, I combined the two into a &apos;major 7th&apos;<br/>&gt; chord to hear what it would sound like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not very good.<br/>&gt; Reminded me of a car horn more than anything.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m talking old-fashioned gas-guzzling American<br/>&gt; car horn, not the little Jap honk.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the chord:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 : 99/80 : 3/2 : 11/6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, imagine my suprise when I investigated the<br/>&gt; individual dyad subsets to find exactly where the<br/>&gt; unpleasantness was coming from.  I expected it<br/>&gt; to be manifested somewhere in those 11-limit<br/>&gt; connections, but that wasn&apos;t it at all!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The strong dissonance came from the 40/27 (a 5-limit<br/>&gt; interval) between the two 11-limit notes.<br/>&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I made two other versions of the chord that changed<br/>&gt; that 40/27 into a nice smooth 3/2:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 : 99/80 : 3/2 : 297/160, and<br/>&gt; 1/1 : 11/9  : 3/2 : 11/6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They both sound lovely.<br/>&gt; The top one definitely has a &apos;major&apos; flavor,<br/>&gt; even tho it&apos;s very different from 8:10:12:15.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The bottom one, which uses the 11/9 you mentioned,<br/>&gt; definitely has a &apos;neutral&apos; flavor, neither major nor<br/>&gt; minor, although it can function as either, depending<br/>&gt; on context.</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
