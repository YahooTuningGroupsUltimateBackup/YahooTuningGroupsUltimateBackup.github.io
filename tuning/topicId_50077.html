With this<br/>data format it is possible to control every MIDI Note to &quot;every frequency&quot;<br/>by a fineness of about 1/164 Cents &quot;in abstract&quot;. There exists also a second<br/>instrument at Native Instruments which supports this data format, but I<br/>forgot the name. You can ask Michael Kurz at Native Instruments:<br/><a href="mailto:michael@native-instruments.de">michael@native-instruments.de</a><br/> &quot;In abstract&quot; means: I don&apos;t know whether the internal system of this<br/>instrument supports such a high fineness. Ask Michael Kurz.<br/>&quot;Every frequency&quot; means every frequency between the deepest and the highest<br/>tone of the referred instrument</p><p>There exist, too, physical electronic instruments which support this data<br/>format: All actual VIRUS syntesizers of ACCESS:<br/><a href="http://www.kemper-digital.com">www.kemper-digital.com</a><br/>These instruments support this tuning fineness not only &quot;in abstract&quot; but,<br/>too, in reality.</p><p>Informations in the MIDI data format &quot;Scale Octave Tuning Real Time&quot; you<br/>will find at<br/><a href="http://www.midi.org">www.midi.org</a></p><p>If you will not find them I can send you these informations directly.

I have been experimenting with the demo version of the FM7, and<br/>have found it to work quite well.  I don&apos;t know exactly what direction I<br/>want to go in acquiring a synth, but I will probably opt for software.  I<br/>understand that the program &quot;Li&apos;l Miss Scale Oven,&quot; retunes synths that are<br/>theoretically not retunable, and so finding a retunable synth might not be a<br/>concern for me.  I appreciate your information.</p><p>=</p><p>Bill Sethares wrote:</p><p>Andrew, I have a Ztar and have been using it for a number of<br/>years. It&apos;s a fine instrument, it plays well, and is nice for<br/>microtonal work because its not a one dimensional array.<br/>Of course, it still isnt perfect...</p><p>I use a lot of different software - Max is great for customizing<br/>the interface and for doing the kinds of adaptive tuning things.<br/>I also use Bitheadz Unity as a software sampler<br/>(reasonable tuning table support).

I find the user interface somewhat<br/>cumbersome, and have taken to doing most of the string-retuning in<br/>software (Max) rather than using the built-in methods. Finally, I &quot;paid<br/>extra&quot; to have a breath controller input - though it functions, it does<br/>not do so smoothly or consistently.</p><p>Let me add, however, that I have played extensively on Roland<br/>pitch-coversion guitars and on the &quot;beetle quantar&quot; which used the<br/>infrared technology. The Ztar is far better than either of these<br/>alternatives, which is why I hesitate to voice my complaints too<br/>strongly.
