Not going to happen.</p><p>I think it very well may happen in a &quot;watered down version&quot; of what&apos;s<br/>going on at this list. I don&apos;t know if we&apos;ll see mavila catching on<br/>anytime soon, but keep in mind that the 20th century was all about<br/>finding different harmonic things to do in 12-tet besides using it as<br/>a meantone temperament. And I don&apos;t just mean in the atonal sense, but<br/>in a harmonic sense as well. Would that be xenharmonic music in<br/>12-tet?</p><p>Or for it to be xenharmonic, would the tuning have to change? So what<br/>if someone did a 5-limit adaptive JI piece then? I just did a 5-limit<br/>adaptive piece for my dad&apos;s doo wop album (I recorded it one chord at<br/>a time and retuned the guitar each time). Most people won&apos;t never<br/>notice, but to me the harmony sounds exceptionally &quot;clean.&quot; Is that<br/>microtonal?</p><p>Anyway, without playing word games, I suppose the general consensus<br/>would be that no, neither of those are really what anyone&apos;s getting at<br/>when they&apos;re talking about &quot;microtonal pop music.&quot; But I think before<br/>we get crazy BP scale stuff in pop music, we&apos;ll see stuff like that<br/>happening first... a subtle retuning of 12-tet to adaptive-JI for<br/>electronic stuff (as an &quot;aural effect&quot;), or the use of more clever<br/>temperaments existing within 12-tet that haven&apos;t been really explored<br/>(like the 17- and 19- limit temperaments I posted last week).</p><p>I could see that eventually evolving into either meantone+7 or<br/>meantone +11 as a &quot;bridge&quot; to more crazy stuff too. If classical guys<br/>are messing around with crazy tuning, then there&apos;s always that sect of<br/>&quot;artsy&quot; bands like Bjork and Radiohead that like to imitate stuff like<br/>that (Radiohead has used string arrangements with quarter tones and<br/>such).</p><p>But I doubt we&apos;ll see popular musicians delving into regular mapping<br/>and treating each temperament as a different possible armonic language<br/>to explore as is being done on this list before the end of the world<br/>in 2012.</p><p>I also have a prediction that whatever band first does get into<br/>microtonal stuff is going to have all kinds of stupid numerological<br/>ideas about it. I have hence given this the term &quot;bro-theory.&quot; As in,<br/>&quot;hey bro, didn&apos;t you know that 12 equal is out of tune? yeah, because<br/>the fifths aren&apos;t actually pure, 12 of them aren&apos;t supposed to match<br/>up like that.&quot;</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 11:06:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Get off it!
