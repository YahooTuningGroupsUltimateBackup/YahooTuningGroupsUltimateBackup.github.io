I represented the attractor X values as time<br/>and the Y values as pitch scaled to an octave.  Time has been normalized to<br/>10 measures of 4/4 between bifurcations and continues until the period<br/>exceeds 16.  Each value in a period is assigned to a MIDI track, and then to<br/>a channel with note values and pitch bends assigned to produce the<br/>appropriate pitch.  The result is not a tuning, per se, but a series of<br/>tunings gradually changing from 1 to 16 tones. This is microtonal but not<br/>just intonation.  The result is available on my website at<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/bmames.geo/">http://www.geocities.com/bmames.geo/</a></p><p>The function used is: y -&gt; x(1-y)y</p><p>Verhulst dynamics are fairly simple to use for the purpose of creating<br/>musical interpretations of fractals. Since Sarkovskii&apos;s theorem assures us<br/>that periods of all whole numbers exist in this function, one only need to<br/>find the appropriate value of X to produce the number of tones desired, then<br/>provide an interpretation of the Y values.</p><p>Of the items you mentioned, studies of the Lorenz attractor, Mandelbrot set,<br/>and bifurcations should be productive, but graphs of the Lyapunov exponent<br/>would not be since it is a measure of the stability of an attractor, not an<br/>attractor itself. Other possibilities include Newton&apos;s method for real<br/>equations and Volterra-Lotka systems.</p><p>References:</p><p>The Beauty of Fractals, H.-O. Peitgen and P.H.
