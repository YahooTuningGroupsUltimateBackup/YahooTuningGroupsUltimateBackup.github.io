Passages in the diminished scale are extremely<br/>common in 20th century movie scores, non-serial classical, jazz, and even<br/>progressive rock; the augmented scale is much less common (Blackwood<br/>suggests that it&apos;s because it&apos;s very hard to write a good melody without<br/>major seconds -- hmmm . . .)</p></div><h3>D.

I was sure that you were using<br/>Balzano&apos;s theories, because Balzano rejects the frequency ratios inherent in<br/>the _natural_ harmonic series. Apparently, I was wrong!</p><p>Balzano depicts the diatonic scale using a triagular lattice, as I do in<br/>figure 3 of my paper. The difference is that he views the intervals not as<br/>approximations to frequency ratios, but as operations on the group C-12 (a<br/>circular group of 12 elements). He thinks that the fact that the operations<br/>of moving by zero to three minor thirds and moving by zero to two major<br/>thirds together generate an unambiguous representation of C-12 (which<br/>obviously relies on the fact that the size of the minor third times the size<br/>of the major third equals 12) is somehow significant. His paper is so<br/>beautifully presented that you can easily forget to question that point, but<br/>it&apos;s really just a numerological game like Yasser&apos;s.</p><p>Anyway, 7-out-of-12 is related to the the fact that 3 (size of minor third)<br/>plus 4 (size of major third) equals 7 (another numerological game, despite<br/>all the fancy group-theoretic footwork which I won&apos;t go into here but is<br/>quite beautiful for its own sake). So 20, which is generated by the 4- and<br/>5- step intervals (since 4*5=20), has a 9-tone diatonic, since 4+5=9.<br/>Further Balzano microtonal systems would be 11-out-of-30, 13-out-of-42,<br/>15-out-of-56, and 17-out-of-72. The basic &quot;consonant intervals&quot; in<br/>17-out-of-72 would be 133 cents and 150 cents. Clearly Balzano&apos;s theory,<br/>like Yasser&apos;s, runs aground when these implications are fleshed out.</p><p>Balzano later proposed that tetrads be used instead of triads in<br/>9-out-of-20, to fill in that big empty 13-step hole left by his original<br/>triads. But that ruins the beauty of his original theory. Zweifel has taken<br/>Balzano very seriously and has published papers about 11-out-of-20, etc. in<br/>Perspectives of New Music.</p><p>Although Balzano&apos;s paper explicitly mentions frequency ratios as the basis<br/>of previous studies and then presumes to ignore them, there&apos;s a big lie<br/>involved. He assumes total octave equivalence, but the octave of course is<br/>2:1, the simplest frequency ratio after 1:1. This he never mentions.</p><p>To me the clincher is that, although his theory claims to cover the whole<br/>system of tonality and key-relations of common-practice music, is that that<br/>system arose in conjunction with meantone temperament (as well as fuzzier<br/>tunings for non-fixed-pitch instruments) and that 19- or 31-tone equal<br/>temperaments were deemed superior than 12 but rejected for considerations of<br/>convenience. His whole theory  hinges on the number 12 in such a strong way<br/>that it completely crumbles if you use 19 or 31 instead.</p><p>Sure, Balzano&apos;s scales have important properties in common with the diatonic<br/>scale, such as the fact that modulation by the generating interval produces<br/>one chromatic shift. But any MOS scale has these properties, so there&apos;s no<br/>reason to single out 9-out-of-20.</p><p>&gt;Yes, but how about any non-12, 6 or 8 note &quot;generalized diatonic scale&quot;<br/>&gt;proposals along the lines of the others you cited?</p><p>I can&apos;t think of any.</p></div><h3>D.
