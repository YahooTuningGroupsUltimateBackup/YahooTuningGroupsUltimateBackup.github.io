Gene, you may be interested to know that Ezra was not<br/>aware of the inconsistencies of 72-equal beyond the 17-limit until I<br/>pointed them out to him. In 72-equal, the best approximation of 8:13<br/>plus the best approximation of 13:17 does not equal the best<br/>approximation of 8:17. Many intervals in a 31-limit scale would<br/>therefore have to be represented by something other than their best<br/>approximations in 72-equal. Maybe this is why you (or Scala?) didn&apos;t<br/>find 72-equal among the candidates for an approximation to this<br/>scale . . .</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2005 12:10:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the Wikipedia article on Ezra Sims there is the following<br/>&gt; quote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I seem finally to have identified and made transcribable<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what my ear was after all along: a set of pitches ordered<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in an asymmetrical scale of 18 (or 19) notes, some of them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; acoustically more important than others, transposable<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; through a chromatic of 72 pitches in the octave.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (1978).&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, the only Sims-labeled scales in the Scala archive<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to have little to do with 72-et.
