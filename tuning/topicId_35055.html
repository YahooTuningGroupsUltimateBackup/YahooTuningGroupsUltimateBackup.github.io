There&apos;s not enough rehearsal time for it.  Same<br/>with brass, for the most part.</p><p>So, what I&apos;m saying is that I will have a, basically, 72-tET<br/>framework, but will keep several instruments more playing the 12-tET<br/>part of it.</p><p>Of course, *EVERYBODY* will also be playing quarter-tones so,<br/>essentially I guess I&apos;m saying I will be composing in a 72-tET frame<br/>work using a *24-tET* notational base.</p><p>Sibelius can handle the quarter tones *very* easily...</p><p>Just some thoughts for the future, as I am thinking of *larger* works<br/>again at the moment.</p><p>jp</p></div><h3><a id=35096 href="#35096">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2002 8:31:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; it seems like all you need is a<br/>&gt; &gt; *line*, not a *matrix* . . . and this already exists in many<br/>forms,<br/>&gt; &gt; such as my &apos;intervallic continuum&apos; chart . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Could you please show me, Paul, what I could use for this, then?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You obviously know what I mean:  it&apos;s just a quick reference so<br/>that<br/>&gt; I could take *any* 72-tET pitch and then know the approximate ratio<br/>&gt; relationship (hopefully in colors like the Blackjack chart) with<br/>&gt; *any* other 72-tET pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess you&apos;re saying it&apos;s different as a *full ET* to the<br/>Blackjack<br/>&gt; matrix, that we had to have fully *spelled out* on the Excel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That really worked wonders for me, and, obviously, I want something<br/>&gt; like that for the full 72-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I obviously need to have this clarified in my mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Help!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jp</p><p>joseph, it shouln&apos;t be too hard to mentally grasp the interval<br/>between any two 72-equal pitches.</p><p>for example, from C&gt; to F#v is a tritone, minus a sixth-tone, minus a<br/>twelfth tone.</p><p>so it&apos;s a tritone minus a quarter-tone.</p><p>look this up on the &apos;intervallic continuum&apos; chart and you&apos;ll<br/>immediately see that it corresponds to the ratio 11:8.</p><p>see how simple it is?</p></div><h3><a id=35097 href="#35097">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2002 8:42:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ***So then, what you&apos;re saying is I need a kind of &quot;sliderule&quot; that<br/>I<br/>&gt; can &quot;slide around&quot; to find out what the intervals are?</p><p>you should be able to grasp the intervals immediately from their<br/>notation. a sixth-tone is two twelfth-tones, a quarter-tone is three<br/>twelfth-tones, and that&apos;s all you need to know to figure out the<br/>interval size. then look it up in the intervallic continuum chart,</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/secor.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/secor.gif</a></p><p>to see if it corresponds with a &apos;consonant ratio&apos;.</p></div><h3><a id=35113 href="#35113">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2002 12:48:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_35055.html#35097">/tuning/topicId_35055.html#35097</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***So then, what you&apos;re saying is I need a kind of &quot;sliderule&quot;<br/>that<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; can &quot;slide around&quot; to find out what the intervals are?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you should be able to grasp the intervals immediately from their<br/>&gt; notation. a sixth-tone is two twelfth-tones, a quarter-tone is<br/>three<br/>&gt; twelfth-tones, and that&apos;s all you need to know to figure out the<br/>&gt; interval size. then look it up in the intervallic continuum chart,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/perlich/secor.gif">/tuning/files/perlich/secor.gif</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to see if it corresponds with a &apos;consonant ratio&apos;.</p><p>***I think you&apos;re right, Paul.
