And A was indeed the beginning the musical gamut when these names were first devised: In gregorian chant, you had four possible setups for the location of the smaller diatonic steps (and not seven as a renaissance &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the greek modes - ionian, dorian, ... (a far too popular system: why?) - postulated). For each of the four &quot;tonics&quot; (&quot;finals&quot; they called them, and thus they were defined) there were two possible tessituras: an octave above (&quot;authentic&quot;), or a fifth above and a fourth below (&quot;plagal&quot;). The overall sequence of whole and semitones was given by the pythagorean chain of fifths, and it just so happened that the four finals used in gregorian chant were adjacent. For the authentic modes (numbered as they actually were) the half steps were between steps</p><p>i: 2-3, 6-7<br/>iii: 1-2, 5-6<br/>v:       4-5, 7-8<br/>vii:       3-4, 6-7</p><p>So of the four finals it was numero uno that lay lowest in the diatonic sequence.</p><p>The plagal modes had the upper authentic tetrachord below the final (&quot;started on the fifth degree&quot;) and were given the even number following the authentic mode of the same final. So the lowest note in use was the fifth degree of the second mode, and this was named A.</p><p>Different octaves were differentiated by greek and latin, lower and upper case letters, and for the top range the were doubled. But of course all the octaves ran from A to G. I have no idea when that changed, but in place of blaming everything on the keyboard i have a hunch that the use of the right hand pinkie on woodwind instruments could have something to do with it.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=38501 href="#38501">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2002 12:00:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 16:08 2/07/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Hi David</p><p>Hi Wally.</p><p>&gt; I posted this message on the tuning group as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A question that I can&apos;t seem to find an answer to is why the diatonic<br/>&gt;major scale in 12tET starts with or defaults to the letter &quot;C&quot; verses<br/>&gt;the letter &quot;A&quot; which would seem to make more sense since &quot;A&quot; is the<br/>&gt;beginning of the alphabet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve searched in vain for this answer and understand that other<br/>&gt;topics are probably needed to be understood prior to this question<br/>&gt;being answered.</p><p>Not really.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m aware that the layout of the keyboard may have something to do<br/>&gt;with my answer but feel that there may be other reasons.</p><p>No. Nothing to do with it. The keyboard came much later.</p><p>&gt;The diatonic major scale in 12tET with no accidentals obviously is C,<br/>&gt;D,E,F,G,A,B,C but why could it not be A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B ?? And also<br/>&gt;why can&apos;t middle &quot;C&quot; on the piano be called middle &quot;A&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The closest I&apos;ve ever come to getting an answer was in a book which<br/>&gt;simply stated, &quot;there are historical reasons why the musical alphabet<br/>&gt;starts with &quot;C&quot;.</p><p>That is a good short answer. Here&apos;s my attempt to flesh it out a little. I wrote this before learning that Paul Erlich had kindly replied in a similar vein.</p><p>The scale we call the major diatonic scale, the white keys from C to C, has been the single most popular scale in the western world for some hundreds of years now. But this wasn&apos;t always so, and is still not so in some parts of the world, and on some instruments such as bagpipes.</p><p>At the time that letters were first used to refer to notes in the west, the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans, the major diatonic scale was just one undistinguished scale among many recognised possibilities. Some notes were considered fixed and others were considered movable within limits. Also, octave equivalence was not taken so much for granted as it is today, since the recognised span of pitches was only two octaves.</p><p>So it was natural to name the lowest note A and then just keep on going up the alphabet, never mind where the octaves occur. It is simply a historical accident that, at the time of the Roman writer Boethius who turned out to be most influential in the west in later centuries, the lowest recognised note happened to be at the beginning of a series of steps in pitch that went (in the first octave) LsLLsLL (where L stands for large and s for small).</p><p>A-BC-D-EF-G-A</p><p>The only way that the major diatonic (whose steps go LLsLLLs) can be made to agree with that sequence (when it is repeated at octaves) is to start on the third letter, C.</p><p>That note that got named &quot;A&quot; (simply because it was the lowest in use at the time) happened to be the most recent note to be added, and it was soon superceded by an even lower note a large step below it. So you see that the assigning of letter names in that specific way made sense only for a very short time in history, but once it was done we were stuck with them.</p><p>Incidentally that next even lower note was then named using the letter gamma from the Greek alphabet since the Roman alphabet was all used up. Around the same time, the practice of repeating the letters A to G in each octave, took hold.</p><p>Boethius and the Greeks before him had no way of knowing that the major diatonic scale was going to become so popular in the future. But why _did_ it become so popular? That, as they say, is a whole &apos;nother story.</p><p>&gt;I found some links that are interesting with respect as to when<br/>&gt;letters started to be used to identify frequencies.

The next note<br/>&gt;(third space) is C5. The fifth octave continues in similar fashion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;C&quot; seems to be the starting point for many theory topics.
