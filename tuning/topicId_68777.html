The JI end of the matter consists in stacking up 19/16s and 5/4, maybe until a decent fifth turns up. Is there no alternative? The obvious way of equating the minor third results in the ridiculously small comma of 513:512, and I guess one might as well stick to Pythagorean there.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2007 6:28:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No one has given names, or as far as I know even any thought, to 19-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit codimension one temperaments.

I need a relatively small number of uniform steps between intervals of the harmonic series for a start and have to extrapolate to the rest of the octave from there. 67 is already large enough to make it likely that I count wrong, in addition to playing wrong. But since nobody needs me to play in 67 by a deadline, I can spend the rest of my live learning it. (If I should ever be able and allowed to use it in an ensemble situation, I can probably rely on physics and the weakness of my embouchure to pull the thirds down.)</p><p>klaus</p></div>
