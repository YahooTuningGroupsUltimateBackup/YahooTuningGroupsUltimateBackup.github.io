Note that by the very definition of the term &quot;limit&quot;, the<br/>&gt;&gt; 7-limit includes the 5-limit within it, and the 5-limit includes the<br/>&gt;&gt; 3-limit within it, etc.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Kraig Grady wrote,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;ONE!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In a sense, this is correct, although the language here is tricky so<br/>it<br/>&gt;&gt; is very important to be careful. For a scale or chord to be called<br/>&gt;&gt; n-limit, there must be at least one interval that is outside all<br/>limits<br/>&gt;&gt; smaller than n, and I suspect that is what Kraig meant.</p><p>&gt;Paul, I would have thought the answer would be that some scales and<br/>chords are more n-limit &gt;than others ranging from as few as one n-limit<br/>interval and as many as all n-limit intervals. &gt;Would it always have to<br/>include lower limits ?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I understand your question. But in the odd-limit<br/>definition, I can&apos;t think of any set of three or more notes where all<br/>intervals are at the same limit. In the prime-limit definition, though,<br/>you can endlessly stack one interval of a given prime limit and all<br/>resulting intervals will be of the same prime limit.</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;                                                       . . . there can<br/>be<br/>&gt;&gt; no interval in the scale or chord that is outside the n-limit, if we<br/>&gt;&gt; want to call the scale or chord &apos;n-limit&apos;.</p><p>Paul Hahn wrote:</p><p>&gt;Buh?  For chords I agree, but for scales I strongly disagree.  Consider<br/>&gt;the standard JI version of the major scale:</p><p>&gt;1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1</p><p>&gt;Most would consider this a 5-limit scale.  But it contains intervals up<br/>&gt;to the odd limit of 45 (the 45/32 between the 4/3 and the 15/8).<br/>Surely<br/>&gt;no one would call this a 45-limit scale.</p><p>Most would consider it a 5-limit scale, but would either be referring to<br/>the prime limit, or to the odd limit of the harmonies they intend to use<br/>as consonances. If one did use the entire scale as a chord, you would<br/>agree that the odd limit would be 45. So I guess a scale&apos;s odd limit can<br/>only be defined when a description of how the composer intends to<br/>construct consonant harmonies is provided.</p><p>&gt;&apos;Course, it&apos;s only &apos;cos I (and Paul E.) advocate the odd-limit<br/>&gt;interpretation over the prime-limit that this is a problem.</p><p>It was Partch who coined the term &quot;limit&quot;, and though his usage was not<br/>entirely consistent, it was far closer to the odd-limit definition than<br/>to the prime one now in common currency.</p><p>Gary Morrison wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt; How many n-limit intervals must there be in a scale/chord for it to<br/>be called<br/>&gt;&gt; n-limit ?</p><p>&gt;   My impression of the term is that there needs to only be one.</p><p>OK, let&apos;s get this one straight. Harry Partch defined a &quot;ratio of N&quot; as<br/>an interval where the largest odd factor of the numerator and<br/>denominator is N. The &quot;N-limit&quot; is defined as all ratios of N, ratios of<br/>N-2, . . . ratios of 1. (The N-limit tonality diamond is the set of all<br/>pitches that make N-limit ratios with a fixed pitch, usually denoted<br/>1/1).</p><p>So, an N-limit chord only needs to have one ratio of N, but may not have<br/>any ratios of odd numbers higher than N.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s probably<br/>&gt;safe to say that in any scale or chord with more than two pitches, if<br/>you have<br/>&gt;one N-limit interval you pretty much have to have more than one.  If<br/>for<br/>&gt;example, you have pitches X, Y, and Z in a chord, and the interval from<br/>X to Y<br/>&gt;is N-limit, and the interval from X to Z is not, then the interval from<br/>Y to Z<br/>&gt;is.</p><p>&gt;   Actually, that&apos;s true as long as X to Z has a lower limit than N.<br/>If it has<br/>&gt;a higher limit, then that is the chord&apos;s limit.</p><p>This is all right if you replace &quot;N-limit&quot; with &quot;ratio of N&quot; and<br/>rephrase the first two instances of &quot;limit&quot; in the last sentence so that<br/>&quot;ratio&quot; is used instead.</p></div>
