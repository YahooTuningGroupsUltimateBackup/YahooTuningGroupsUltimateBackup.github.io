Instead, the distributions or smears<br/>or sound clusters along the pitch axis serve as &apos;warehouses&apos; for the<br/>collection of pitches the musician is using to construct &apos;local&apos;<br/>scales at the micro level within the framework of a macro scale whose<br/>elements (notes) are the smears themselves. During the course of an<br/>improvisation (taksim~taqsiim) the musician visits the underlying smears,<br/>drawing a certain pitch (only one) from each cluster at any point in<br/>time. Such collection of pitches form the notes of a micro scale created<br/>at that moment during the evolution of the improvisation. When the taksim<br/>re-visits a given cluster at a different point in time, a different pitch<br/>is selected from the cluster to contribute to a different local scale<br/>pertinent to the evolution of the taksim at that time.</p><p>Based on these speculations on my part, the phenomenon does not appear<br/>to be a &apos;blur&apos; as suggested in Rothenberg&apos;s model. I might be looking<br/>at a similar phenomenon from a totally different angle though. In fact<br/>the two models may turn out to be complementary!<br/>Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>1255 Dauphin Street<br/>Mobile, AL 36604<br/>USA</p><p>Phone:  (334) 441-2126<br/>  Fax:  (334) 441-3290<br/>  Web:  <a href="http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/">http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/</a></p></div>
