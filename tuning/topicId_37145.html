In such dialogue,<br/>each idea can be a springboard to another, and one felicitous<br/>observation may call forth the next, in a delightful kind of<br/>conceptual antiphony recalling the splendor of the Venetian school<br/>from Willaert and Zarlino to the Gabrielis and Aleoti.</p><p>Having so far had an opportunity to meet your published statements<br/>only at second hand, it is with a certain cautious temerity that I<br/>address a few ideas which I have seen quoted or paraphrased from your<br/>writings, often ideas that prompt me to reflection regarding some of<br/>my own musical goals and their possible antecedents in this most rich<br/>art of ours.</p><p>To the following remarks I attach the qualification, always prudent<br/>but here especially imperative, that I warmly invite correction of any<br/>errors I make regarding your writings and views, be they matters of<br/>fact, interpretation, or more subtle distortions of emphasis and<br/>context.</p><p>In this endeavor, however tentative, I would follow the good counsel<br/>of approaching aesthetic issues hypothetically or suppositionally, as<br/>it were, rather than absolutely. That is, one may take a certain<br/>aesthetic or stylistic postulate as the basis for a given manner of<br/>music -- or to explain the beauty of that manner -- while leaving open<br/>the merits of very different or even apparently contradictory<br/>hypotheses which might lead to equally beautiful musics.</p><p>For example, while much of my music and intonational practice is based<br/>on the postulate that &quot;a ratio of 14:11 or 9:7 is an excellent size<br/>for a major third,&quot; this postulate supposes a certain manner of<br/>treating these major thirds, one in which they tend to be relatively<br/>concordant but active intervals which often expand to stable fifths at<br/>or near 3:2.</p><p>To do intonational justice to the exquisite music of the 16th century<br/>in Western Europe, indeed a tradition marked by the masterly<br/>chromaticism of a Lasso, Vicentino, Marenzio, or Gesualdo, we must<br/>entertain the different hypothesis that a major third is ideally tuned<br/>at or quite near to the ratio of 5:4.</p><p>Here there is no absolute contradiction, but rather a contrast between<br/>different styles, each with its own assumptions, which on a grander<br/>scale may be taken alike as joined in a common concentus of reason and<br/>beauty.</p><p>Similarly, Harry Partch favors a &quot;monophonic&quot; system of intonation,<br/>here referring not to the performance of a single melody (as opposed<br/>to polyphony), but to a scheme where all pitches are seen, if I<br/>understand correctly, as related to a single central note.</p><p>Yet in what I shall term focal pluriphonic harmony, we typically have<br/>tuning systems based on a set of notes forming intervals and vertical<br/>combinations &quot;pleasantly related to each other,&quot; but not necessarily<br/>to a single central pitch. I shall discuss this kind of style in what<br/>follows, since it may illustrate a most engaging theme of your<br/>writing: the attractions of a contrast between concord/discord or<br/>stability/instability which may be achieved in a range of tuning<br/>systems.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>1. Just intonation and its rationales<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>As a just intonation advocate who often favors a diverting mixture of<br/>simple and complex ratios, and the most attractive contrasts in the<br/>concentus which such mixtures offer, I would like to clarify two<br/>distinct aspects of a &quot;just&quot; worldview -- a worldview which may also<br/>find expression, to a considerable extent, in many irrational<br/>temperaments also.</p><p>Although the _purity_ of intervals is a frequently emphasized theme of<br/>a &quot;just&quot; viewpoint, I would like to focus at least equally on the<br/>often complex _rationality_ of intervals as an element, both musical<br/>and extramusical, in the lure of a just intonation system.</p><p>Of course, purity is a part of the picture, both historical and<br/>current: I would find it a usual assumption that a &quot;just&quot; tuning<br/>should include many instances of pure fifths and fourths at 3:2 and<br/>4:3, as is true both in the Pythagorean tunings of Gothic Europe, the<br/>font of focal harmony, and in some modern systems mixing these ratios<br/>with pure ratios of 7, 11, 13, or 17, etc.</p><p>However, as the writings and instruments of such an illustrious<br/>musician as Kathleen Schlesinger amply demonstrate, a delight in a<br/>complex rational structure, for example an arithmetic division of the<br/>monochord, can play an equally vital role in shaping a just system.</p><p>There is a special pleasure, at once musical and intellectual, in<br/>including in a single tuning, along with stable ratios of 3:2 and 4:3,<br/>diverse unstable concords such as major thirds at 81:64, 33:26, 14:11,<br/>23:18, and 9:7. Musically, of course, all of these sizes can fit the<br/>same basic musical &quot;grammar&quot; of a major third striving to expand to a<br/>fifth as its perfect goal, yet there is an elegant diversity of<br/>ratios.</p><p>Moreover, a complex ratio such as 33:26 may have the special charm of<br/>at once drawing in the intellect with its rational proportion, and yet<br/>presenting to the ear a kind of intriguing complexity grasped only in<br/>part. Thus the beauty perceived and enjoyed by the senses, albeit<br/>imperfectly, may serve as a worthy ladder of contemplation.</p><p>Thus just intonation may fulfill two aesthetic criteria which, if I<br/>understand correctly, your own writings look on as causes of delight:<br/>a mixture of familiar and less familiar intervals; and a contrast<br/>between &quot;concordance/discordance&quot; or &quot;simplicity/complexity,&quot; however<br/>these concepts or categories might be defined in a given style.</p><p>For those of us following an approach of focal harmony, drawing its<br/>roots from the compositions of such artists as Machaut and Landini,<br/>and enriched by the resources of the Arabic, Persian, Kurdish, and<br/>Turkish traditions, the contrast is often one between the stable 3:2<br/>or 4:3 and the many kaleidoscopic shades of relative concord,<br/>assonance, or discord provided by a congenial tuning system, and<br/>especially a larger one of 17 or 24 notes, for example.[1]</p><p>Two aspects of many of these just systems should be frankly<br/>acknowledged. First, for example in systems based on a diverse set of<br/>superparticular ratios, not all regular fifths are pure: some may be<br/>&quot;tempered by ratio&quot; a few cents wide, rather like those in meantone<br/>(albeit there in the opposite direction), while others may have ratios<br/>removed from 3:2 by as much as a full 64:63 or so, that is, at or<br/>around 32:21.</p><p>Secondly, a just and fully circulating system would seem to require at<br/>least 53 notes, since this is the size of the cycle of pure fifths<br/>which &quot;virtually closes&quot; when one tunes a chain of 52 such fifths or<br/>fourths and adds the octave of the starting note. If one requires<br/>musical circularity as well as purity of fifths and fourths -- apart<br/>from the last &quot;odd fifth&quot; about 3.62 cents narrow -- then such a cycle<br/>might provide one ideal just solution.</p><p>Of course, one might argue that this just and pure tuning is, in<br/>effect, a &quot;quasi-equal&quot; division of the octave; I mention it because<br/>its copious resources may serve, as it were, as a bridge between the<br/>&quot;just&quot; and &quot;equal&quot; schools of intonation.</p><p>This leads me to another type of tuning which is neither just nor<br/>equal, but either strictly regular, or else irregularly well-tempered,<br/>and may also admirably serve the needs of focal harmony as an<br/>alternative to either conventional tonality or atonality.</p><p>-----------------------<br/>2. Open regular tunings<br/>-----------------------</p><p>Although just tunings provide one ready approach to a mixture of<br/>simplicity, complexity, and contrast, another approach is an<br/>irrational temperament based on a regular chain of fifths somewhat<br/>larger than pure.</p><p>For example, I have found a regular tuning with fifths at about 704.61<br/>cents as a very pleasant scheme in 24 notes. Here we have regular<br/>major and minor thirds close to 14:11 and 33:28, plus middle thirds<br/>not too far from 17:14 and 21:17, and large major and small minor<br/>thirds close to 9:7 and 7:6.</p><p>From a melodic viewpoint, we have regular diatonic semitones at about<br/>77 cents; some pleasant chromatic semitones at around 132 cents; and<br/>small semitones or dieses at about 55 cents. There are also some<br/>distinctively &quot;microtonal&quot; steps of around 22 cents for subtle shifts<br/>and nuances.</p><p>Such a system, although open, is freely transposible within the range<br/>of the gamut, and permits a diversity at once vertical and melodic. It<br/>fits especially what I might term a _combination-based_ technique, in<br/>which assorted intervals unit in a pluralistic set of multi-voice<br/>combinations or sonority. One can observe this kind of technique in<br/>the music of a Perotin or Machaut, and it takes on new possibilities<br/>in the intonational atmosphere of the 21st century.</p><p>------------------------<br/>3. New well-temperaments<br/>------------------------</p><p>In addition to regular temperaments with fifths gently larger than<br/>pure, we have such a compendious system as George Secor&apos;s 17-note<br/>well-temperament of 1978, which almost 25 years later has a wealth of<br/>beckoning options to offer a creative composer or improviser.</p><p>The scheme of this microtonal master combines tempered ratios of 3 and<br/>7 with some near-just ratios of 11 and 13 in a most ingenious and<br/>musically fertile manner, one admirably seeming as if custom-designed<br/>for a focal style of harmony with stable fifths and fourths and active<br/>regular thirds and sixths, but in fact supporting a wealth of styles<br/>drawing inspiration from many world musics.</p><p>Here I should also mention that Paul Erlich has applied the device of<br/>unequal and irregular temperament to a 22-note cycle, and that the<br/>possibilities here for a variety of cycle sizes are still largely<br/>unexplored. As is sometimes said in the natural sciences: &quot;In this<br/>area, almost everything remains to be done.&quot;</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>4. &quot;Unusual&quot; tunings and new concords<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>Given the reality of stylistic relativity in a world filled with<br/>diversified musics and tuning systems, I would like to emphasize that<br/>an &quot;exotic&quot; tuning means one unfamiliar to a specific artist -- and<br/>possibly the classical and canonic norm for another.</p><p>Thus while an equal or near-equal fivefold division of the octave<br/>seems common in a range of world musics, the tuning of 20 equal steps<br/>to the octave might be &quot;exotic,&quot; with its 720-cent fifths, to a<br/>musician accustomed to Western European systems where fifths are<br/>customarily for the most part within about 7 cents of 3:2.</p><p>The purpose, at least from my point of view, in using such a &quot;novel&quot;<br/>system is not to seek out sheer discord, but rather to explore<br/>tuning/timbre combinations yielding new patterns of concord, tension,<br/>and subtle contrast.</p><p>For example, 20-equal has a major third of 420 cents, close to 14:11<br/>or 23:18 and thus a commonplace in focal harmony; but the 720-cent<br/>fifths and 480-cent fourths, quite concordant in timbres chosen to<br/>this view, result in a different kind of harmonic geometry, and the<br/>interval of 240 cents may delightfully serve as either a large major<br/>second (quite close to 8:7) or kind of &quot;quasi-minor-third&quot; contracting<br/>to a unison by stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>As Dan Stearns, a distinguished composer in this temperament, has<br/>observed, it has some of the attributes of 5-equal -- which, I might<br/>add, is a rough approximation of the slendro scale of gamelan.</p><p>The search for new consonance, achieved through the kind of timbral<br/>adjustment discussed by such musicians and theorists as Pierce,<br/>Darreg, Chowning, Carlos, and Sethares, has a particular allure when<br/>applied to tunings such as the division of the octave into 13 equal<br/>limmas, or yet more radically into 11 equal apotomes.[2]</p><p>In a more &quot;usual&quot; kind of tuning for focal harmony, the presence of<br/>fifths and fourths at or rather close to 3:2 and 4:3 provides a kind<br/>of &quot;natural gravitation,&quot; as it were, toward these intervals as stable<br/>concords of resolution.</p><p>In 13-equal, however, the equivalent of the fifth is at around 738<br/>cents; and in 11-equal, at around 655 cents. The sense of stability<br/>and resolution provided by such intervals seems an &quot;artificial<br/>gravity&quot; of timbre, artistic convention, and sheer historical<br/>association. Here, at least in my kind of focal or &quot;quasi-focal&quot;<br/>approach to these tunings, the goal is not maximal discord but rather<br/>enchanting ambiguity: a 462-cent interval in 13-equal might be taken<br/>as either a stable &quot;quasi-3:2&quot; or an active cadential &quot;quasi-9:7&quot; or<br/>&quot;quasi-13:10.&quot; In 11-equal, timbred to maximize the concord of the<br/>6-step or 655-cent interval, this interval might represent either a<br/>&quot;quasi-3:2&quot; or a kind of tritone -- which it literally is.</p><p>Such &quot;new consonance&quot; is only one approach to such tunings, and I<br/>would emphasize that some other styles seem an attractive counterpart<br/>to 12-tone serialism or pantonalism. While some critics might describe<br/>this kind of music as pursuit of arbitrary dissonance for its own sake<br/>-- consider Schoenberg&apos;s alleged &quot;indifference to beauty&quot; in<br/>dodecaphony -- musicians knowing and practicing such an art may have a<br/>very different view.</p><p>One might argue, of course, that any &quot;novel&quot; tuning or music will<br/>eventually become familiar; but in the process, the range of the<br/>familiar and the scope for further innovation have been alike<br/>enlarged.</p><p>Thus music has its multitude of reasons, each enriching and<br/>ornamenting the overall art.</p><p>In conclusion, please let me emphasize that I have not sought here to<br/>address your presentation on the specific attractions which have led<br/>you and other most artful colleagues to a 72-note equal temperament,<br/>but rather to present a kind of counterpoint, possibly combining<br/>elements of similar and contrary motion, which may find its<br/>realization in an agreeable texture of dialogue and friendship.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Focal harmony combines standard 14th-century European progressions<br/>with &quot;less conventional&quot; European elements such as the direct<br/>chromaticism and intriguing if often problematic intonational nuances<br/>advocated by Marchettus of Padua (1318), and also resources such as<br/>neutral steps and intervals documented, for example, in medieval Near<br/>Eastern practice and theory as well as other world traditions.</p><p>2. These descriptions somewhat playfully suggest that the 13-equal<br/>step of 1/13 octave or ~92.31 cents is quite close to the Pythagorean<br/>limma or diatonic semitone at 256:243 (~90.22 cents); while the<br/>11-equal step of 1/11 octave or ~109.09 cents is not too far from the<br/>Pythagorean apotome or chromatic semitone at 2187:2048 (~113.69<br/>cents).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=37146 href="#37146">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2002 9:10:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
