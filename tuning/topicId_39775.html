Are they going to be made<br/>&gt; on a &quot;Production Line&quot; or are they custom built?<br/>&gt;</p><p>There will be a prototype and several others made for the full grant.  Orders<br/>for the next 10 will be filled by the builders.  After that, they will be<br/>made to order (or stock) by a third party.  I wanted it well underway before<br/>announcing it.  It should be available by summertime.</p><p>&gt; Could your give a link to a reference for the keyboard layout (I am not<br/>&gt; familiar with Sieman Terpstra)?</p><p>Siem does not have a web site and lives in Amsterdam in Nederland.  He has<br/>written for 1/1 and other tuning oriented periodicals.</p><p>I would be interested in knowing if this &gt;<br/>&gt; is a &quot;generalized&quot; keyboard?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Is there a plan to release a version with &gt; more than 5 octaves?<br/>&gt;</p><p>It would be diminishing returns: it would be physically too large, harder to<br/>transport, harder to move around, and even with an arc, it would destroy the<br/>symmetry offered by Siem&apos;s design.  Besides, you could use a macro (even a<br/>pedal) to switch everything an octave lower or higher.</p><p>&gt; Do you know what the starting price is going to be?</p><p>I hope the starting price will be under $2,000 US.</p><p>Also, is it &gt;<br/>&gt; something that will just be a MIDI controller, or will it have its own<br/>&gt; synth?</p><p>It will not have its own synth.  Any synth compatible with SCALA will work.<br/>Also, you won&apos;t need a synth because it can be plugged directly into the<br/>computer and work with SCALA in that manner (though the choice of timbres is<br/>more limited).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike</p><p>You most welcome.
