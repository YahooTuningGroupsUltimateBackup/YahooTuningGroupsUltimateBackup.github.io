(Now juggling with<br/>&gt;   my two available MIDI-claviers) All the best</p><p>Here I should clarify that the MIDI file wasn&apos;t recorded on any<br/>musical keyboard instrument, but rather programmed with a computer<br/>keyboard using Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s fine Scala program available free<br/>on the Internet.</p><p>Having defined a 38-note tuning corresponding to Vicentino&apos;s adaptive<br/>JI scheme taken as based in 1/4-comma meantone, I then typed a text<br/>file coding the notes of Lasso&apos;s Prologue, which Scala translated into<br/>a MIDI file using the EXAMPLE command.</p><p>To map this ideal 38-note scheme onto a musical keyboard, one approach<br/>might be the one that Vicentino followed for the most part on his<br/>archicembalo, and presumably also his arciorgano: two 19-note manuals<br/>(Gb-B#) with split keys for the five usual accidentals, plus levers<br/>for E# and B#. The notes on the upper manual are tuned in &quot;just<br/>fifths&quot; to those on the lower manual.</p><p>In practice, Vicentino couldn&apos;t fit the E# and B# levers into the<br/>upper manual, so he wound up with 36 notes per octave. This wouldn&apos;t<br/>be a problem for the Lasso piece, which has a basic range of Eb-A#, or<br/>14 notes. The sharpmost fifth is D#-A#&apos;, with the apostrophe (&apos;)<br/>representing Vicentino&apos;s &quot;comma sign&quot; here likely showing a note<br/>raised by a quartercomma or so to form a pure fifth. (The amount by<br/>which a meantone fifth is tempered is one of Vicentino&apos;s definitions<br/>of a &quot;comma.&quot;)</p><p>Thus the rendition in my computer-generated MIDI file _could_ in<br/>theory have been performed on Vicentino&apos;s instrument in its adaptive<br/>JI tuning.</p><p>Your request for a clarification not only gives me a chance to explain<br/>that this MIDI file was indeed generated using a computer keyboard<br/>rather than a musical one -- historically authentic or otherwise --<br/>but to invite some discussion about issues that often come up when<br/>early music meets modern technologies.</p><p>Also, as I discuss below, it is quite possible to have a useful<br/>24-note set on a musical keyboard for Lasso&apos;s Prologue with just<br/>fifths in lots of positions; the main issue might be how well a human<br/>player can navigate such a scheme in real time.</p><p>First of all, to address your immediate query, I do indeed use a<br/>24-note arrangement on synthesizer with two 12-note meantone manuals<br/>(Eb-G#) a diesis apart for &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; music -- a very useful<br/>subset of Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic 31-note cycle, but different from his<br/>adaptive JI scheme.</p><p>As it happens, Vicentino&apos;s own enharmonic pieces using dieses or<br/>fifthtones can each fit within such a 24-note gamut with two manuals a<br/>diesis apart. While I use Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab as &quot;standard&quot; (the * showing a<br/>note raised by a 128:125 diesis, about 41.06 cents), Vicentino often<br/>uses a range of Bb-D#/Bb*-Eb, as in his complete motet _Musica prisca<br/>caput_. One madrigal section uses Ab-C#/Ab*-Db.</p><p>While I&apos;m not aware of any historical precedent for a 24-note<br/>archicembalo in this arrangement, I find it very attractive for<br/>enharmonic music; but the fifths are tempered at a usual 1/4-comma.</p><p>Please let me add with due modesty that I use this arrangement mostly<br/>for &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; improvisations, and for playing brief and<br/>simple examples from Vicentino and Colonna. What an accomplished<br/>keyboardist could do with it is something else again.</p><p>Likewise, for Lasso&apos;s Prologue, I simply arrange two manuals in Eb-G#<br/>and F-A#, the equivalent of split keys for Eb/D# and Bb/A# -- usual<br/>meantone, as opposed to adaptive JI. Again, trying to play through it<br/>and enjoying the process is one thing, and playing fluently something<br/>else again.</p><p>Now let&apos;s consider an adaptive JI solution for Lasso&apos;s Prologue on a<br/>24-note keyboard with two 12-note manuals. This calls for a bit of<br/>&quot;untidiness,&quot; since we don&apos;t have quite enough notes for a complete<br/>system over the range of this piece, but let&apos;s try for a reasonable<br/>compromise solution.</p><p>If we wanted a symmetrical 24-note system, we could tune the lower<br/>manual Eb-G# in 1/4-comma, and then tune each note of the upper manual<br/>to a &quot;just fifth&quot; above a note on the lower manual, as in Vicentino&apos;s<br/>38-note scheme, giving us Eb-G#/Bb&apos;-D#&apos; (the &apos;again showing a note<br/>raised by a quartercomma to produce a pure fifth with the lower<br/>keyboard).</p><p>Here our basic gamut is Eb-A#, so the above scheme would leave us with<br/>an A# problem. A rough and ready solution is to settle for a usual<br/>tempered meantone fifth Eb-Bb on the lower manual, and tune the upper<br/>manual F&apos;-A#&apos;. This gives us only tempered forms for the two fifths at<br/>the extremes of our gamut, Eb-Bb and D#&apos;-A#&apos;, but just alternatives<br/>for all the others, from Bb-F&apos; to G#-D#&apos;.</p><p>As someone whose main idea of &quot;tuning&quot; is entering numbers for a<br/>microtuning table, I give advice on how this might be done on a<br/>harpsichord or the like with due caution. However, a basic approach<br/>might be to tune the lower manual in 1/4-comma meantone at Eb-G#, and<br/>then tune the notes F&apos;-D#&apos; on the upper manual in pure fifths with the<br/>notes Bb-G# on the lower manual. Then A#&apos; could be tuned a pure major<br/>third above F#&apos;.</p><p>Here&apos;s a general map of this adaptive JI gamut:</p><p>               75:64<br/>       81       275              585      778      971<br/>       C#&apos;      D#&apos;              F#&apos;      G#&apos;      A#&apos;<br/>   C&apos;        D&apos;        E&apos;     F&apos;       G&apos;       A&apos;      B&apos;    C&apos;<br/>   5        198       391    508      702      895     1088  1205<br/>                                      3:2              15:8<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                                        25:16<br/>       76        310            579      773       1007<br/>       C#         Eb             F#       G#        Bb<br/>   C         D         E      F        G        A       B     C<br/>   0        193       386    503      697      890     1083  1200<br/>                      5:4</p><p>I&apos;ll also add a Scala file for this 24-note set at the end of this<br/>message, in case it might be useful.</p><p>In practice, I suspect that the main issues might concern not so much<br/>the merely tempered rather than just fifths Eb-Bb and D#&apos;-A#&apos;, but the<br/>practical complications of negotiating the intricacies of adaptive JI<br/>in real time.</p><p>(For example, there are some 5-cent quartercomma shifts between notes<br/>in certain sonorities easy to program in Scala, but maybe &quot;nontrivial&quot;<br/>to handle fluently on a musical keyboard.)</p><p>Certainly a skilled performer can get striking just sonorities a good<br/>part of the time; the question might be how often, how reliably, and<br/>with what effort. Since the distinction between JI and meantone might<br/>be most telling with prominent and sustained sonorities, where finding<br/>the right notes might be easiest, we need not assume flawless and<br/>relentless JI to appreciate such pure fifths and thirds could have a<br/>captivating quality -- in 1555, or 2002.</p><p>Whatever conclusions one might draw from the experiences of performers<br/>who try this -- a skill worthy of cultivation for period performers --<br/>I am impressed by how Vicentino&apos;s 16th-century system for adaptive JI<br/>seems to fit so smoothly with 21st-century MIDI technology which can<br/>manage the intricacies of sounding the right note at the right time.</p><p>This is just a quick answer which I hope addresses some of your<br/>immediate questions, and invites much more dialogue. I&apos;d be fascinated<br/>to learn about your meantone keyboard playing, and any 24-note tunings<br/>you might try.</p><p>Again, to sum up, I&apos;ve found a 24-note &quot;enharmonic archicembalo&quot;<br/>tuning with two manuals a diesis apart to be delightful: you get lots<br/>of fifthtone steps a la Vicentino, plus the various kinds of<br/>&quot;proximate&quot; intervals he described a diesis larger or smaller than<br/>usual -- although not in every position, unlike his 31-note circle or<br/>that of Fabio Colonna (1618).</p><p>With Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI, my approach has been using computer<br/>coding to generate MIDI files. However, with a 24-note instrument and<br/>a tuning like Eb-G#/F&apos;-A#&apos;, it should be possible to get just fifths<br/>and minor thirds, as well as the pure major thirds of 1/4-comma, for<br/>most of Lasso&apos;s Prologue. How well a player could do this in real<br/>time, or how helpful a reference it might be for a flexible-pitch<br/>ensemble (e.g. for certain prominent sonorities), I&apos;d leave to<br/>experienced keyboardists to test by experiment and experience.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>P.S.
