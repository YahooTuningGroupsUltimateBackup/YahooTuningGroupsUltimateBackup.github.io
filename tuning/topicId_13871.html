<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Keyboard magazine</h1><h3>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>9/30/2000 10:26:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There is a brief mention of microtonality in the &quot;Reader Letters&quot;<br/>section of this month&apos;s Keyboard magazine.  Basically a reader wrote<br/>asking about microtonal synths and the like.  The Keyboard writer who<br/>responded mentioned there were synths with tuning tables (but didn&apos;t<br/>say which ones) and that samplers can also be used... if the reader<br/>is willing to tune and map the samples himself.</p><p>In the same issue there is an interview with keyboardist Lyle Mays (a<br/>personal favorite of mine) concerning his new &quot;solo piano&quot; album.<br/>The album is marketed as a solo piano project but the interview<br/>reveals that he used a lot of piano samples.  He mentioned a desire<br/>to &quot;further stretch diatonicity&quot;.  I would imagine, based on my<br/>limited education in tuning and time on this list, that based on<br/>these comments maybe he would want to give just intonation or perhaps<br/>one of the historical tunings a try.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
