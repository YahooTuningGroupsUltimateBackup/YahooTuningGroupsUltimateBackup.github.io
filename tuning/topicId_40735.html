Must have been quite a thing :-).</p><p>If one approaches it algebraicly I expect it would be quite complex, however<br/>the musical lattices are quite simple mathematical structurs if you look at them number theoretically<br/>and geometrically.</p><p>Start with the five limit lattice. You can think of that just as the numbers<br/>3^a*5^b. Then a triad is 3^a5^b, 3^(a+1)*5^b, 3^a*5^(b+1), or<br/>3^a*5^b, 3^(a-1)5^b, 3^a*5^(b-1),</p><p>Then, once you&apos;ve got the idea of representing this geometrically, maybe<br/>ones first thought is to use a square lattice with 3 horizontally and 5<br/>vertically. But then you draw it and see that you have got 45 degree<br/>icoseles triangles for the triads. Nicer to use a sixty degree rhombus<br/>for the unit cell instead of a square, and then you have a tiling<br/>by regular triangles instead.</p><p>Now to go into three dimensions, just add an extra term to the number<br/>theoretic expression:<br/>3^a*5^b*7^c</p><p>Triads obtained by taking numbers in pairs and incrementing one of them<br/>at a time:<br/>3^a5^b*7^c, 3^(a+1)*5^b*7^c, 3^a*5^(b+1)*7^c,<br/>3^a5^b*7^c, 3^(a+1)*5^b*7^c, 3^a*5^b*7^(c+1),<br/>3^a5^b*7^c, 3a*5^(b+1)*7^c, 3^a*5^b*7^(c+1),</p><p>or the same with -1 instead of +1.</p><p>Then again one might think of drawing the three axis at right angles,<br/>and that is perfectly valid of course, but it looks nicer if you<br/>make the tetrads into tetrahedra.</p><p>Then to go into four dimensions, do the same procedure, but usse<br/>simplexes for the pentads.</p><p>Since the simplex generalises to all higher dimensions, then<br/>that immediately gives you the n-dimensional generalisation.</p><p>So geometrically, that is all there is to it.</p><p>One can then study the algebraic properties of it as an<br/>emergent structure.</p><p>Of course algebraic studies would be expected to give new insights<br/>into it, but I think this already defines the lattice geometrically<br/>as a mathematical object for study.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2002 3:12:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If one approaches it algebraicly I expect it would be quite complex...</p><p>Actually, I think that is the easiest approach.

Nothing more needs to be done, and the generalization to higher dimensions is immediate.</p></div>
