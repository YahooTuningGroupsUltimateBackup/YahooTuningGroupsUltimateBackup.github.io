Whoa! It&apos;s hard to believe we&apos;re talking about the same thing.<br/>(Do we have to go back there? Clearly I wasn&apos;t convinced then. On the other<br/>hand, that might be a good place to start our &apos;experiments.&apos;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The diminished fifth<br/>&gt;&gt; sucks like a vacuum toward a major or minor third resolution and an<br/>&gt;&gt; augmented fourth pushes like an explosion toward a major or minor<br/>&gt; sixth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i agree that this is a defining feature of tonal music as it<br/>&gt; developed in the western world. i disagree that the augmented fourth<br/>&gt; has to be larger than the diminished fifth for it to work. that<br/>&gt; tendency is only about half as old as tonality.</p><p>Yes. And what a discovery. While the clerics of the middle ages forbade the<br/>tritone, and the devil-may-care Renaissance composers bent the rules, it was<br/>the early Baroque that discovered the full value of the &quot;tritone.&quot; Some of<br/>those slow introductions to their concertos were mind blowing. No wonder the<br/>harpsichordist tried to add extra digitals on his &apos;axe.&apos;</p><p>&gt; perhaps it became<br/>&gt; important once (a) the system was fully &apos;closed&apos; at 12 pitches; and<br/>&gt; (b) modulations were so common and so great in span (on the chain of<br/>&gt; fifths) that a given tritone could easily resolve to two different<br/>&gt; tonal centers.</p><p>That&apos;s my point, dear heart. It&apos;s the ambiguous *keyboard* &quot;tritone&quot; that<br/>prompted its &quot;three whole steps&quot; nickname. It&apos;s not that it &quot;has to,&quot; but<br/>that it *can*. A well-tuned diminished fifth (by my definition) is easy to<br/>distinguish from a well-tuned augmented fourth. Clearly, the keyboard<br/>tritone &quot;works.&quot; Not only that, but jazzers (including me) get off on the<br/>&quot;substitute chords&quot; of a Db chord for a G7 (in C). However, the resolving<br/>&quot;tritone&quot; can be appropriately squeezed or stretched in either case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Call it &quot;style&quot; it you like. I call it &quot;tonal gravity.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My response here is say that, in my opinion, the major/minor system<br/>&gt; works<br/>&gt;&gt; best when considered in terms of flexible tuning--not 12tET tuning.<br/>&gt; If only<br/>&gt;&gt; choral groups and orchestras were fully aware of the power of the<br/>&gt; flexible<br/>&gt;&gt; tritone in &quot;flinging&quot; tonality into myriad tonal directions simply<br/>&gt; by<br/>&gt;&gt; modifying its tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this seems to support my statement above. before modulations became<br/>&gt; as &apos;flingy&apos; as they have been since beethoven, there was really no<br/>&gt; desire to make the augmented fourth larger than the diminshed fifth.</p><p>Surely, you don&apos;t swallow everything the historians say? Perhaps if they<br/>heard my group sing, they might have relaxed their &quot;theories.&quot; I know my own<br/>sources regarding music theory didn&apos;t always describe what they were<br/>hearing--rather what they expected to hear.
