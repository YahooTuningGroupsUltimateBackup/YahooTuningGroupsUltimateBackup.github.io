I recorded much of a<br/>stockcar race once. With the sounds at that volume, there weren&apos;t any<br/>echoes to tell my brain that the space got reversed, and it really did seem<br/>a bit odd to hear the traffic constantly rising in pitch as it went by. I<br/>suppose if you record from the middle of a highway with few trees around<br/>you could produce some pretty interesting illusions. It&apos;s just thatcha<br/>don&apos;t want any sounds that ring or produce echoes.</p></div>
