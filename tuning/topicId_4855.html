(tonic dominant dominant tonic subdominant tonic<br/>&gt; dominant tonic).</p><p>Hello, there, and thank you for a very interesting post. Above all,<br/>expressing my gratitude for your kind words, I would like to applaud<br/>your concept of systems of counterpoint for 7-limit or higher<br/>tunings. In a sense, Nicola Vicentino took this step in 1555 when he<br/>recognized the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; (which he defined as around<br/>11:9) as a practical consonance. However, it is a road largely still<br/>untaken.</p><p>Further, I would agree that if we define &quot;harmony&quot; in terms of a<br/>system of chords with key functions, then this development falls<br/>somewhere in the Baroque era, maybe roughly around 1660-1680, the<br/>epoch of Stradella and Corelli. This is also, interestingly, around<br/>the time that Werckmeister (1681 and later) marks the beginning of<br/>documented unequal well-temperaments, associated with major/minor<br/>tonality, in contrast to the meantone temperaments associated with<br/>5-limit modal polyphony.</p><p>One point about medieval through early 17th-century European polyphony:<br/>I would describe it as an art of simultaneous melodies and<br/>consonances. While it is often said that vertical sonorities are<br/>&quot;incidental&quot; to the melodies, what I perceive is an exquisite balance.<br/>The central difference between modal and tonal polyphony, as I see it,<br/>is not that the vertical sonorities and progressions are &quot;incidental&quot;<br/>in the first, but that they follow patterns and &quot;rules&quot; different than<br/>those of the major/minor key system.</p><p>Such compositions have regular vertical sonorities, progressions, and<br/>cadences -- but different, and I might argue in some ways more diverse<br/>and fluid, than those of 18th-19th century tonality. One might say<br/>either than the diversity of these vertical progressions permits the<br/>free development of melody, or that these progressions serve as a<br/>splendid amplification of melody.</p><p>&gt; In investigating melody and simultaneous melody, it is sufficient<br/>&gt; (and proper) to do it in the subset of a temperment that may be<br/>&gt; described as &quot;modal&quot;, which again, makes sense since it can evolve<br/>&gt; the rules of tonality in the new tuning. 12 tones should be able to<br/>&gt; contain a particular &apos;scale&apos; and its &apos;rotations&apos; that may be used in<br/>&gt; a new tuning.</p><p>Maybe one way of putting this is to say that where tonal music often<br/>focuses on transposing the same scale patterns (major or minor) to<br/>various pitches, modal music often shifts among different centers or<br/>scales using the same pitch materials, with appropriate cadential<br/>accidentals, chromatic touches, etc. For example, a piece in D Dorian<br/>may often have internal cadences on F and/or A. Also, a piece may mix<br/>various modes, a technique discussed by Vicentino in 1555 and the<br/>Monteverdi brothers in 1607, for example.</p><p>The availability of 12 modes provides resources for variety and<br/>contrast analogous to circular modulation in tonal music. Each system<br/>has its own charms, so that, as Ed Foote has pointed out, 1/4-comma<br/>meantone may be ideal for Cabezon but a bit &quot;bland&quot; for Mozart.</p><p>For the most part, a conventional 12-note meantone tuning (Eb-G#)<br/>nicely covers the range of standard accidentals in the 14th-16th<br/>centuries. I should add that experimental pieces generally extend this<br/>range without requiring a closed system. Thus if we take 1/4-comma<br/>meantone as roughly equivalent to 31-tet, then avant garde<br/>16th-century pieces often call for 14 out of 31, or 17 out of 31, or<br/>(in the case of Vicentino and Bertrand) up to 24 out of 31 -- but not,<br/>to my best knowledge, all 31 out of 31 for a single piece.</p><p>The typical Renaissance solution for such pieces is to use &quot;split<br/>keys&quot; on a meantone keyboard for G#/Ab and Eb/D#, etc. Vicentino<br/>describes his two-manual keyboard with split keys providing 36 notes<br/>per octave in all (a quasi-31-tet plus a few extra notes, likely for<br/>some pure fifths). One modern solution is to use two standard 12-note<br/>keyboards which can be tuned independently, permitting anything from<br/>12 to 24 notes per octave.</p><p>Thank you again for a post which I hope may lead to much future<br/>dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
