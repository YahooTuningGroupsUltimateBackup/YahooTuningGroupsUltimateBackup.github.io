Beats are periodic reinforcement and cancellation of<br/>a two-tone waveform in a *linear* medium (electronic or acoustical).<br/>There is *no* physical energy created at the beat note frequency. One<br/>can prove this with two oscillators and a spectrum analyzer.  A<br/>difference tone (a.k.a. a Tartini tone) is produced by mixing two tones<br/>in a *non-linear* medium, such as the human ear (or electronically in a<br/>fuzz-box), also called heterodyning.  This process *does* create<br/>physical energy at the difference frequency (and sum frequency, and many<br/>other higher order products).  It is this *real* tone that the human<br/>subject hears, eg, the &quot;ghost flute&quot;.</p></div>
