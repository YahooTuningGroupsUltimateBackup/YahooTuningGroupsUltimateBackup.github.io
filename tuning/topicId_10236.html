But Partch implies that we should build chords by<br/>increasing their limit rather than their frequency.</p><p>&gt;I think that Paul meant that a 2:3, or a 4:6:9 are the same as a<br/>&gt;1/(3:2) and a 1/(9:6:4),</p><p>Those would be 9-limit chords.</p><p>&gt;Major and minor? Well, if you&apos;re talking about otonal and utonal, 3:2 and<br/>&gt;1/2:1/3 are both perfect fifths, and 4:3 and 1/3:1/4 are both perfect<br/>&gt;fourths.  It is certainly not the case that the perfect fifth is otonal<br/>&gt;and the perfect fourth is utonal.</p><p>Sorry, I did mean otonal/utonal.  Yes, otonal and utonal 2:3 create<br/>dyads of the same size, but, like Margo, I consider the &apos;power chord&apos;<br/>the basic sonority of the 3-limit, since it is saturated.  2:3:4<br/>otonal, 1/(2:3:4) utonal.  Using scale degree numbers here was also<br/>a bad choice on my part.  Anyway, I do find the difference between<br/>these two &quot;trines&quot; similar to the difference between other saturated<br/>otonal/utonal pairs through the 9-limit.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Another thing -- by my proposed definition of minor, all ASS&apos;s would be<br/>&gt;&gt;minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK -- what&apos;s your proposed definition of minor again?</p><p>Any consonance of odd-limit x with significantly less tonalness than the<br/>saturated x-limit otonal sonority.</p><p>It&apos;s really no big deal, and perhaps we should leave the definition of<br/>minor alone.  I simply suggest that the property above can be heard, in<br/>a variety of different consonances, as a _quality_, and that this quality<br/>has something to do with how we percieve music written in the major and<br/>minor modes of the diatonic scale.</p><p>I seem to remember reading somebody suggesting that this quality had<br/>to do with the way combination tones work in utonal v. otonal chords.<br/>Same idea.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
