He blames<br/>it on his &apos;old age&apos;: 46 years. Mahler<br/>had gotten into an argument with Sch&ouml;nberg at one point over<br/>whether or not it waspossible to create a Klangfarbenmelodie [&apos;melody<br/>of tone colors (timbres)&apos;] by constantlyshifting the orchestration of<br/>asingle note; Sch&ouml;nberg was to carry out this idea in 1909 in<br/>the third of his Funf Orchesterst&uuml;cke. With this dispute in mind,<br/>Mahler&apos;s remark aboutbeing too old to have an ear for Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s<br/>music was perhaps referring directly to his loss of the ability to<br/>hear high frequencies, due to aging and daily exposure to the volume<br/>of 100-piece orchestras. In any case, the logic in Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s<br/>thought and music are convincing, and Mahler continues to support him<br/>all the same.</p><p>The above quotation comes from Joe Monzo&apos;s terrific history of music<br/>in &quot;turn of the century&quot; Vienna.  Clearly, there is a &quot;different kind<br/>of listening&quot; going on... that possibly presages our present-day<br/>fascination with the overtone series and &quot;timbral listening....&quot;</p><p>From webern to Sethares (??)  Perhaps not such a great leap after<br/>all...</p><p>Monz&apos; article:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a></p><p>________ ___ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
