Szanto&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jszanto@adnc.com">jszanto@adnc.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Hubris, Inc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I respond mainly because points were brought up directly regarding my last<br/>&gt; posting on the subject of &apos;interpretation&apos;. As a short preface, I hope that<br/>&gt; everyone on the list can grasp the *extremely* wide variety of performing<br/>&gt; scenarios involved in the word &quot;music&quot;! What is appropriate to jazz may not<br/>&gt; be to classical, Sousa marches vs. Javanese gamelan. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING<br/>&gt; (though I have to say it) that I *expect* a rendition of Mingus&apos; &quot;Goodbye,<br/>&gt; Pork Pie Hat&quot; to include improvisation and arrangement;</p><p>And yet Chopin and Liszt piano works (excuse the repetition, it is to me<br/>the most glaring example) are performed by orchestra all the time. Is this<br/>not a radical reworking? Yet this is common practice. I don&apos;t like it, but<br/>this is the way things *really are* in western classical music. People<br/>reorchestrate, change tempo, add ornamentation, change keys, move<br/>orchestral works to solo instruments, move solo works to orchestras, lose<br/>entire sections, play the overture only, drop the last movement, and on<br/>and on.</p><p>&gt;I *don&apos;t* expect<br/>&gt; extended solos in a middle-period Beethoven quartet.</p><p>And you have never heard them. No one here is doing anything nearly that<br/>radical. DeLaubenfel&apos;s 5 limit retuning is closer to 12tet than most of<br/>Pablo Cassals&apos; work. The evolution of musical instruments and their<br/>tuning is, to a large degree, driven by the desire of the composer to have<br/>a vehicle with which to accurately execute his compositional requirements.<br/>Certainly the historical evolution of western tuning from Pythagorean and<br/>just to equal temperament bears witness to this, and I daresay the tunings<br/>lagged behind the composition. It seems quite reasonable that Bach would<br/>have invited John in and played with his programs for a long time had he<br/>the opportunity.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/> &gt; If the effort is made for the purpose<br/>&gt; of examining the composer&apos;s thrust of the piece, in a sincere and<br/>&gt; intelligent (and heartfelt) way, there can be great value. If pieces are<br/>&gt; operated on for ear candy, for raw material in service of some historically<br/>&gt; unsupportable hypothesis, I find that not of value and disrespectful. It<br/>&gt; may be impossible to know, but there are *lots* of evidential parameters<br/>&gt; that can be examined - if one cares to.</p><p>It seems to me that DeLaubenfels *is* making careful and informed choices,<br/>constantly refining his algorithms to find the most pleasing and logical<br/>choices. This is exactly what Bach would have done if the instrument of<br/>his day had been a computer, assuming that tuning was important to him.<br/>And all historical evidence suggests that it was.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not saying that arrangements are invalid, but that they must be<br/>&gt; examined in a larger context, as well as stating that there are pieces that<br/>&gt; don&apos;t need your help. And having done a lot of composition AND<br/>&gt; arrangements, it is my feeling that pulling an entirely new musical life<br/>&gt; out of the aether is tougher than tweaking someone else&apos;s notes. Your<br/>&gt; mileage may vary.</p><p>It is indeed tougher, but that is not what John is trying to do. He is<br/>building musical tools to overcome some inadequacies of the current ones.<br/>He is using these tools to retune public domain music under the perfectly<br/>reasonable assumption that these great composers might have liked his new<br/>tool, and might have used them like this, had they the opportunity.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/1999 1:14:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Jon Szanto:]<br/>&gt; it is my feeling that pulling an entirely new musical life out of<br/>the aether is tougher than tweaking someone else&apos;s notes.

But beyond that, &quot;the perfectly reasonable<br/>assumption that these great composers might have liked his new tool,&quot;<br/>seems to me no different than saying that it&apos;s a perfectly reasonable<br/>assumption that they may not have...</p><p>And my own opinion is that if these are supposed to be taken as<br/>striking &quot;art&quot; on it&apos;s own, then there is something distressingly akin<br/>to &quot;colorization&quot; about the whole process... I mean these are not<br/>rearrangements (or even arrangements outside of whatever&apos;s been done<br/>before they got to JdL&apos;s program for that matter), they&apos;re just<br/>retunings - one size fits all... and it just seems (to me anyway) that<br/>it would be a much better (or prudent) idea to present the retunings<br/>of the existing material as experiments in seeing what seems to work<br/>and what could use some tweaking, rather than an impossible to say<br/>(and obviously disagreeable to many) assumption that these great<br/>composers might have liked this.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>Paul H.

They usually mention these<br/>three tuning systems and compare them with one another, showing that equal<br/>temperament approximates the other two and explaining how &quot;convenient&quot; equal<br/>temperament is. The major omission here is of course meantone temperament.<br/>Western composers of the &quot;early&quot; (c.900-1680) and &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>(c.1680-1900) eras did not write music in just intonation, with the possible<br/>exception of a brief &quot;schismatic&quot; period in the 1400s. There were three<br/>major tuning paradigms for Western music: Pythagorean, meantone, and 12-tone<br/>circulating (ultimately ET), in that order. If one wishes to view this as an<br/>&quot;evolution&quot;, equal temperament should really be compared with meantone,<br/>which is what it &quot;evolved&quot; from (although 12-equal had been present on lutes<br/>since the Pythagorean era, so that&apos;s another somewhat relevant comparison).<br/>One should, of course, compare each _consonant interval_ in ET with the JI<br/>version of that interval, but to me what is usually done, comparing an<br/>entire _scale_ of 7 or 12 tones in ET with one in JI, is musically<br/>irrelevant and misleading.</p><p>See Margo&apos;s recent posts on _Modality, Tonality, Transpositions, and<br/>Tunings_ for more info on historical tuning, and see Dan Stearns&apos; recent<br/>posts for an example of approximating JI _scales_ with ETs without regard of<br/>what happens to the _consonant intervals_ (sorry if this seems underhanded<br/>Dan, I mean no disrespect; I&apos;ve made clear my objections to your approach<br/>before).</p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/10/1999 12:46:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    From: &quot;Jonathan M.
