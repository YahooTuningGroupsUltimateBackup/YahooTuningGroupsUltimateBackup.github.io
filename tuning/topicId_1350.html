In Partch&apos;s terminology:</p><p>You shouldn&apos;t find it surprising, since Erlich&apos;s scheme cuts up ratio space<br/>using the Farey series, which is embedded in the diamond.  Also, I don&apos;t<br/>believe it measures consonance, it measures the &apos;field of attraction&apos; of an<br/>interval...  It does happen that the most consonant ratios tend to have the<br/>biggest field of attraction, so what you&apos;re saying is true, but not valid;<br/>the consonance of the &apos;magnets&apos; decreases at least as rapidly with<br/>mistuning as the consoncance of the &apos;satellites&apos;.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
