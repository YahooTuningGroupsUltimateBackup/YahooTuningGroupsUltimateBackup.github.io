I hope everyone here listens to this<br/>and learns, because (stylisms aside) you&apos;ve got a whole lot of<br/>wonderful sound crafting, intonational stuff, rhythmic interest and<br/>especially the final presentation: great mixing, with lots of<br/>attention to placement of instruments, etc.</p><p>And that from an .mp3 file. Any interest in explaining, in a brief<br/>manner, the tools you used for this example?</p><p>Feh to the people with stock patches.
