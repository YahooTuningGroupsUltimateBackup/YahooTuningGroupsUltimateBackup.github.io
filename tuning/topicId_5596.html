But it will ultimately respond, and usually seems to<br/> &gt;work just fine.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt;I will have it all up on the web soon anyhow.</p><p>It is one thing that we are able to access the old Mills College tuning<br/>list archives. It is quite another to post them publicly on the web. I have<br/>talked with Joe Monzo about this once before. Mailing lists such as the old<br/>Mills list, while not entirely anonymous, are semi-private ways of having a<br/>community. By taking items that were written with that intent and posting<br/>them publicly, a number of serious issues are raised.</p><p>Some lists either don&apos;t want the archives made public at all, or want them<br/>made available to the list members only. Other lists have raised the topic<br/>before and for various reasons have asked that the archives never be made<br/>public, and so nobody has. If there are *no* objections to making the<br/>archives available on a web site somewhere, then I suppose it&apos;s OK.<br/>However, it would seem that any one objection should be considered reason<br/>enough to NOT publish them publicly.</p><p>There are also questions of spam harvesters, etc. that you need to be quite<br/>concerned about. If you found unanimous support for publishing, the very<br/>least one would expect is that the addresses, etc. have been scrubbed and<br/>replaced with generic information, such as &quot;Jonathan M. Szanto &quot;<br/>&lt;*******@****.***&gt; or something similar. I have no problems with someone<br/>posting information on how to access the archives (maybe more detailed info<br/>on Mark Nowitzky&apos;s page?) and even highlights of some of the digests.</p><p>Personally, I don&apos;t have a big problem with the *content* of those postings<br/>ending up somewhere, but there are issues to ponder before you simply plop<br/>them on a web site somewhere. It isn&apos;t too much to ask, I think, to<br/>consider and respect the wishes of the people that contributed to the Mills<br/>tuning list in these matters.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.
