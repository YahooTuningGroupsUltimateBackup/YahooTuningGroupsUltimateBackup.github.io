It&apos;s not simply a scale with 9 pitch classes on an equal footing though; far from it.

One maqam in particular, maqam Nahawand (<a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/nahawand.html">http://www.maqamworld.com/maqamat/nahawand.html</a>) is remarkably similar to classical minor tonality, but there are plenty of others that have a similar system of alternates although they bear little resemblance to major or minor scales. I understand that a similar situation exists for Indian ragas. Introductory texts on both maqamat and ragas often emphasize how they are &quot;more than simply scales&quot; because of such related idioms... but classical minor tonality is also more than simply a scale of 7 or 9 notes.</p><p>Note that if you modulate from one minor key to another minor key a fifth away (one of the simplest and most common modulations), that&apos;s already 11 out of the 12 pitch classes of 12edo.

As it happens, this<br/>12-note set is strictly proper -- but the main point is to<br/>illustrate a few of the modal inflections relevant to your post.</p><p>First, the tuning:</p><p>! met24c-cs12-archytan-maqam_cup.scl<br/>!<br/>Constant Structure, tempered subdivision of Archytas Chromatic<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 68.55468<br/> 207.42187<br/> 288.86719<br/> 357.42187<br/> 496.28906<br/> 564.84375<br/> 703.71093<br/> 772.26562<br/> 911.13281<br/> 992.57812<br/> 1061.13281<br/> 2/1</p><p>Taking the 1/1 as C, we have this 12-note keyboard mapping.<br/>Note that an ASCII &quot;d&quot; shows an Arab half-flat, while a &quot;+&quot; shows<br/>an Arab half-sharp. In this tuning, these signs generally lower<br/>or raise a note by around 1/3 tone, while a flat lowers by around<br/>2/3 tone. Certain notes might function as either a flat or a<br/>half-sharp, as we&apos;ll see.</p><p>    69    289          565     772     992<br/>   C+/Db   Eb          Gb/F+   Ab/G+    Bb<br/> C       D     Ed    F       G       A      Bd     C<br/> 0      207   357   496     704     911    1061  1200</p><p>As it happens, Maqam Nahawand -- somewhat analogous to a Western<br/>minor tonality -- is intimately related to Maqam Rast. So let&apos;s<br/>first look at Rast, often called the &quot;fundamental scale&quot; of Arab<br/>music, and then Nahawand, both of which typically occur on C, so<br/>that modulating between them is very common. More generally,<br/>maqamat (the Arabic plural form of maqam) sharing the same usual<br/>final or resting note, here C, have a certain &quot;family affinity&quot;<br/>which permits freely modulating from one to another.</p><p>In this keyboard mapping, we find a &quot;textbook&quot; form of modern<br/>Rast on the seven diatonic keys:</p><p>   207     150   139    207     207    150     139<br/> C       D     Ed    F       G       A      Bd     C<br/> 0      207   357   496     704     911    1061  1200<br/> |------- Rast ------|       |-------- Rast -------|</p><p>Generally Rast has two tetrachords -- here disjunct, with a step<br/>of around 9:8 in the middle of the octave -- each with a lower<br/>tone around 9:8, and a larger neutral second followed by a<br/>smaller one. Exact tunings vary a great deal in the Near East,<br/>with this one perhaps best expressed in JI terms as 39:44:48:52<br/>or 1/1-44/39-16/13-4/3 (0-209-359-498 cents).</p><p>More precisely, this is the usual modern form of the _ascending_<br/>Maqam Rast. In descending, the seventh step is often lowered from<br/>a largish neutral seventh to a minor seventh, which gives us this<br/>form:</p><p>   207     150   139    207     207    81     207<br/> C       D     Ed    F       G       A     Bb      C<br/> 0      207   357   496     704     911   993    1200<br/> |------- Rast ------|       |------ Nahawand -----|</p><p>Lowering the seventh step not only underscores the descending<br/>motion back toward C, the final or resting note (sometimes also<br/>known as the tonic by analogy to 17th-19th century Western<br/>tonality), but introduces the new element of a melodic semitone,<br/>contrasting with the usual tones and neutral second steps of<br/>Rast. The upper tetrachord on G, tone-semitone-tone, is called<br/>Nahawand, also the name of Maqam Nahawand which features this as<br/>its &quot;root&quot; tetrachord above the final.</p><p>Here is one possible form of ascending Nahawand on C, with Arab<br/>understandings varying a great deal:</p><p>   207     81    207    207    69     289      139<br/> C       D    Eb     F       G    Ab        Bd     C<br/> 0      207  289    496     704  772       1061  1200<br/> |----- Nahawand ----|       |------- Hijaz -------|</p><p>This interpretation of ascending Nahawand has a lower Nahawand<br/>tetrachord, a middle tone, and for its upper tetrachord one of<br/>the many forms of Hijaz. The safest general description of Hijaz<br/>focuses on its large middle step appreciably larger than a 9:8<br/>tone, and often somewhere between 8:7 and 32:27 or so. Here the<br/>middle step is identical to a regular minor at around 13:11,<br/>although a smaller size around 7:6, for example, might be<br/>considered more stylish.</p><p>In this interpretation of Nahawand, the Hijaz tetrachord has a<br/>small semitone, a large step around 13:11, and an upper neutral<br/>second step around 13:12 (69-289-139 cents). Note that the<br/>neutral seventh step is identical to that of ascending Rast.<br/>Many current versions of Nahawand prefer a higher minor or<br/>neutral sixth step and a major rather than neutral seventh; but<br/>the interpretation above has an interesting affinity with Rast.</p><p>Looking at the lower Nahawand tetrachord, we see that only one of<br/>the four notes is changed from Rast: a third step at 289 rather<br/>than 357 cents. In the upper Hijaz tetrachord, similarly, only<br/>the second step, lowered from a major to a minor sixth, differs<br/>from the Rast tetrachord on G in the ascending form of that<br/>maqam.</p><p>A common descending form of Nahawand has minor sixth and seventh<br/>steps, comparable to a Western natural minor. The upper or Kurdi<br/>tetrachord, semitone-tone-tone, is like the European Phrygian<br/>mode:</p><p>   207     81    207    207    69    220     207<br/> C       D    Eb     F       G    Ab      Bb     C<br/> 0      207  289    496     704  772     993   1200<br/> |----- Nahawand ----|       |------- Kurdi -----|</p><p>Still another possibility, however, occurs in ascending to the<br/>final or its octave, especially when making a cadence. Here we<br/>can use both the major sixth and neutral seventh steps of Rast<br/>for a kind of &quot;melodic Nahawand,&quot; as it were. For example, when<br/>cadencing on the final, I might descend from F to C, and then<br/>play a kind of coda, A-Bd-C:</p><p>       207   150    139    207    81    207<br/>   [G]     A     Bd     C       D    Eb      F<br/>   704    911   1061    0      207  289     496<br/>    |...................|--------------------|<br/>            &quot;Rast&quot;             Nahawand</p><p>Many contemporary performers might prefer for this idiom A-B-C<br/>with a major rather than neutral seventh, which would make the<br/>usage closer to that of a Western melodic minor. However, I find<br/>a special charm in the major sixth and neutral seventh as a<br/>common element shared between this form of Nahawand and Rast.</p><p>I might also mention another maqam typically played on C which in<br/>this 12-note tuning exhibits a stylized intonation of a Hijaz or<br/>related genus with a smaller interval than the usual minor<br/>third. This is Maqam Nakriz, which seems to combine some aspects<br/>of Maqam Rast and Maqam Nahawand, and can serve as a nice<br/>variation on either or both:</p><p>   207     81     276     139    207    81    207<br/> C       D    Eb        F+    G       A   Bb      C<br/> 0      207  289       565   704    911  993    1200<br/> |---------- Nakriz ----------|--- Nahawand ------|</p><p>Nakriz (or Nikriz) in this interpretation has a tone and semitone<br/>(like Nahawand), and then a large interval like that of Hijaz,<br/>here 276 cents or somewhat larger than 7/6, followed by a smaller<br/>neutral second to complete the fifth (207-81-276-139 cents). To<br/>this lower pentachord is added an upper Nahawand tetrachord,<br/>which provides a pleasant contrast.</p><p>Like Nahawand, Nikriz in my practice may have a neutral seventh<br/>step below the final, and possibly a major sixth step below that<br/>(A-Bd-C). Current Arab practice often favors a major rather<br/>neutral seventh step as a raised leading tone for both maqamat.</p><p>As I&apos;ve cautioned, not only the fine points of intonation, but<br/>the more general nature of certain inflections -- whether<br/>ascending Nahawand has a neutral or major seventh, or whether the<br/>lower pentachord of Nakriz has a minor third and low tritone or a<br/>neutral third and higher tritone -- can vary, in theory and<br/>practice!</p><p>My purpose here, however, is to show how different maqamat can<br/>interact, with the case of Rast and Nahawand being an especially<br/>interesting one.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
