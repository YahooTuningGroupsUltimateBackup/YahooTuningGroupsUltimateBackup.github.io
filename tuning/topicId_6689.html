Therefore I<br/>very warmly dedicate what follows to this scholar and composer.</p><p>The question is basically this: why is it that while Bach writes<br/>keyboard pieces in C# major in his _Well-Tempered Clavier_ of 1722<br/>(WTC for short), no one was writing such pieces a century earlier?</p><p>The obvious answer, as Bill Alves notes, is that while one certainly<br/>could have played such pieces on an appropriately retuned meantone<br/>keyboard in 1622, no one kept keyboards in such a tuning.</p><p>Interestingly, however, the composer and organist Giovanni Paolo Cima<br/>(c. 1570-?, fl. 1622) in his _Partitio de Ricercari &amp; Canzoni Alla<br/>Francese_ (1606), does include a brief keyboard piece given first in a<br/>usual D Dorian, and then with the final transposed to each of the<br/>other 11 steps of an ascending scale, with instructions before each<br/>example for retuning the necessary notes.[1]</p><p>Thus in the early 17th century, at least one keyboard composer did<br/>write in C# Dorian. However, such pieces involving the transposition<br/>of usual progressions to remote steps of a 12-note chromatic scale<br/>seem the exception rather than the rule in 1606 or 1622, as opposed to<br/>Bach&apos;s epoch a century later.</p><p>Here I would suggest that in approaching the musical question raised<br/>by Bill Alves about pieces written in &quot;C# major,&quot; we focus not only on<br/>the matter of a transposition to C#, but on the _major_ part of the<br/>question: the distinction between the fluid and flexible modality of<br/>the late 16th and early 17th centuries and the major/minor tonality of<br/>Bach&apos;s era.</p><p>For convenience, borrowing a useful term proposed by recent authors, I<br/>use the term Manneristic Era for the period of around 1540-1640, or<br/>roughly Rore-Monteverdi.[2] This era, in my view, is synonymous with<br/>the practice of late tertian modality, with many chromatic and<br/>sometimes enharmonic adornments.</p><p>From an intonational viewpoint, this period includes the 19-note and<br/>31-note circulating keyboards of Vicentino (1555), Costeley (1570),<br/>and Colonna (1618), as well as the 19-note _Cembali chromatici_ or<br/>chromatic harpsichords popular in Neapolitan circles around 1600.[3]</p><p>Given this wealth of adventurous intonations and compositions, one<br/>might ask: &quot;Why is there no modal equivalent of Bach&apos;s WTC from the<br/>Manneristic Era?&quot;</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. The Equally-Tempered Lute: The &quot;48&quot; of Gorzanis (1567)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Interestingly, there _is_ such an equivalent -- but for lute rather<br/>than keyboard. By 1567, Giacomo Gorzanis (c. 1530-c.1575-1579) had<br/>composed a collection of 48 lute dances: each step of the 12-note<br/>chromatic scale serves as a final for four dances. Among each of these<br/>sets of four dances, there is an interesting contrast: two are in<br/>modes belonging to Zarlino&apos;s family with a major third above the final<br/>(Lydian, Mixolydian, Ionian), and two in modes belonging to his family<br/>with a minor third above the final (Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian).[4]</p><p>For this lute collection, unlike Cima&apos;s demonstration of keyboard<br/>transposition about 40 years later, no retuning is required -- because<br/>by around 1545, the standard lute tuning had evidently become 12-tone<br/>equal temperament (12-tet), in which all semitones are equal. Unlike<br/>Bach&apos;s WTC, very likely to have been played in 1722 on a clavier in<br/>some unequal well-temperament, the 48-piece cycle of Gorzanis in 1567<br/>is indeed a very practical celebration of 12-tet.</p><p>The adoption of 12-tet for the lute by the mid-16th century can be<br/>seen as a union of fretting symmetry and Sethareanism.[5] From the<br/>viewpoint of a player realizing a polyphonic composition or<br/>improvisation, having equal semitones much simplified the problems of<br/>fretting across strings. From a Setharean perspective, the timbre of<br/>the lute strings (as opposed to those of the harpsichord) &quot;softened&quot;<br/>the wide major thirds which resulted from the metrics of a tuning<br/>dividing the octave into 12 equal semitones.</p><p>While the theories of William Sethares concerning timbre and<br/>consonance were still some four centuries in the future, Vincenzo<br/>Galilei in his _Dialogue on Ancient and Modern Music_ (1581) and<br/>_Fronimo_ (1584) articulated both factors favoring 12-tet: equal<br/>semitones are extremely convenient for the lutenist, while the strings<br/>soften the effect of the resulting thirds.[6]</p><p>Given a closed and freely transposible system of 12 notes, the<br/>Gorzanis collection of 1567 was one logical development -- just as<br/>Bach&apos;s collection was a celebration of the transpositions made<br/>possible by the well-temperaments of Werckmeister and his colleagues.</p><p>Thus a lutenist of the Manneristic Era enjoyed the flexibility of a<br/>system of 12 modes each freely transposible to 12 steps.</p><p>For a 12-note keyboard, however, as Cima&apos;s examples demonstrate, such<br/>free transpositions would require extensive retuning -- a situation<br/>unlike that of the world of Werckmeister and Bach. What might be the<br/>reasons behind this difference?</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>2. The domesticated Wolves that didn&apos;t bark<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>In surveying the keyboard tunings of the Manneristic Era, we note that<br/>there seemed little interest in circulating tunings with _12_ notes<br/>per octave.</p><p>Circulating tunings indeed there were, but in 19 notes (Costeley) or<br/>in 31 (Vicentino, Colonna). These tunings attained closure (or virtual<br/>closure, if the 31-note schemes are realized in 1/4-comma meantone) by<br/>expansion of the musical universe beyond the usual 12 notes. In<br/>addition to making possible transpositions of the 12 modes to any of<br/>the 19 or 31 steps, these schemes open new universes of expressive<br/>resources: the enharmonic fifthtones of Vicentino and Colonna, or the<br/>thirdtones of Costeley.</p><p>Other and more common arrangements, while leaving the tuning open,<br/>permitted many extraordinary chromatic effects and transpositions of<br/>the kind practiced in the madrigals of Gesualdo. The chromatic<br/>harpsichords popular in Naples around 1600 offered a 19-note range of<br/>Gb-B#, accommodating all of this Prince&apos;s madrigals, with the<br/>exception of one occurrence of Cb. Less ambitious instruments with a<br/>few split keys or _subsemitonia_ -- e.g. G#/Ab, Eb/D#, and Bb/A# --<br/>would permit the performance of such experimental music as Lasso&apos;s<br/>_Prophetiae Sibyllarum_.</p><p>What these different keyboard instruments and tuning systems share is<br/>the use of more than 12 notes in meantone, a temperament optimizing<br/>the vertical thirds and sixths which serve as the prime concords in<br/>this music.</p><p>The approach of expanding a usual 12-note meantone tuning opens the<br/>way to new transpositions and expressive possibilities while retaining<br/>the uniformly smooth and blending qualities of thirds and sixths<br/>across (or around) the gamut. True, Costeley&apos;s 19-tet tuning (almost<br/>identical to 1/3-comma with pure minor thirds) makes some notable<br/>compromises in order to achieve closure in only 19 notes; but still,<br/>it keeps a rather high level of tertian euphony.</p><p>By comparison, the development of a circulating keyboard tuning with<br/>only 12 notes involves, in a tertian style like that of the<br/>Manneristic period, serious compromises in the intonation of thirds<br/>and sixths. The laws of mathematics demand that the average size of<br/>major thirds (and diminished fourths) in such a scheme must be 400<br/>cents, or about 13.69 cents larger than a pure 5:4 (~386.31 cents).</p><p>To have adopted such a scheme for the harpsichord, in contrast to the<br/>lute with its softening Setharean qualities, would have been to<br/>entertain a barking of domesticated Wolves -- intervals which,<br/>although not as dramatically far from 5:4 as a meantone diminished<br/>fourth (32:25 or ~427.37 cents in 1/4-comma), would have very tangibly<br/>deviated from the sonorous meantone ideal.</p><p>We might therefore say that a 12-note well-temperament for keyboard<br/>represents, to borrow a phrase of Sherlock Holmes, &quot;the domesticated<br/>Wolves that didn&apos;t bark.&quot;</p><p>In noting this intonational clue, we should not neglect the various<br/>approaches to remote transpositions which were practiced by composers<br/>and discussed by theorists. These approaches illustrate different<br/>solutions either repositioning or expanding the chain of optimized<br/>meantone sonority rather than compromising it.</p><p>-----------------------------<br/>2.1. Cima&apos;s 12 transpositions<br/>-----------------------------</p><p>In showing how a 12-note meantone keyboard can be retuned to transpose<br/>a piece in the Dorian mode on D to each of the other 11 steps of a<br/>chromatic scale, Cima has in mind &quot;the convenience of singers in their<br/>_concerti_.&quot;[7] While earlier authors such as Zarlino and Morley had<br/>mentioned an organist&apos;s need at times to transpose in order to<br/>accommodate singers, Cima seeks to generalize the practice to &quot;any<br/>tone and interval of our Instrument.&quot;[8]</p><p>Interestingly, in notating the transposed versions, Cima does not<br/>follow the usual accidental spellings, but uses unchanged the<br/>spellings of the black keys in the standard Eb-G# tuning. Thus his<br/>spelling for the notes of the Dorian mode with a final of C# is as<br/>follows (here I use C4 for middle C, with higher numbers showing<br/>higher octaves)[9]:</p><p>C#4 Eb4 E4 F#4 G#4 B[b]4 B4 C#5</p><p>This notation identifies the 12 keys of the instrument by fixed names,<br/>however they are retuned for a given transposition. In the case of<br/>this C# transposition, the retuning instructions are as follows, a<br/>&quot;diesis&quot; here meaning simply a sharp:</p><p>           &quot;Tune f fa ut a major third higher than the diesis of<br/>            c sol fa ut [C# -- i.e., C#-E#]. b fa b mi b molle<br/>            [Bb] at a major third with the diesis of f fa ut<br/>            [F# -- i.e. F#-A#]. c sol fa ut at a major third<br/>            with the diesis of g sol re ut [G# -- i.e. G#-B#].<br/>            e la mi b molle [Eb] at a major third with b fa b mi<br/>            quadro [B -- i.e. B-D#].&quot;[10]</p><p>In other words, to provide the regular notes of C# Dorian plus some<br/>routine accidental inflections, the three standard sharps of the Eb-G#<br/>tuning must be supplemented by four others supplied by this retuning.<br/>Using conventional notation, the basic scale is thus:</p><p>C#4 D#4 E4 F#4 G#4 A#4 B4 C#5</p><p>In addition to these regular notes of the mode, we also need B# for<br/>subsemitonal approaches at cadences to the final C#, and E# for a<br/>concordant and conclusive major third (or tenth) above the final in<br/>the closing sonority C#4-G#4-C#5-E#5. Here Cima notates the highest<br/>note as F5, and indeed it is played by pressing a retuned F key.</p><p>Cima remarks that such retunings map the instrument so that &quot;no one<br/>but you will know how to play it,&quot; and his notation based on fixed<br/>names for the instrument&apos;s keys regardless of the relocation of major<br/>and minor semitones may reinforce this impression.[11]</p><p>As the composer notes, his method is designed to solve the problem of<br/>transposing for singers on a 12-note instrument, rather than possibly<br/>combining arbitrary transpositions in a single piece. In 1606,<br/>however, there were instruments available which could play Cima&apos;s<br/>complete set of transpositions without any need for retuning.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>2.2. Gesualdo, Doni, and the chromatic harpsichord<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>While Gesualdo&apos;s madrigals are of course intended primarily for<br/>voices freed from the constraints of any fixed intonation, one<br/>fascinating passage analyzed by the early 17th-century theorist<br/>Giovanni Battista Doni as an instance of modal transposition<br/>illustrates the kind of music which the Neapolitan chromatic<br/>harpsichord could negotiate with its Gb-B# compass.</p><p>In his landmark study of Gesualdo, Glenn Watkins notes this passage<br/>from the madrigal _Merce&grave; grido piangendo_ (Book V, 1611). At the<br/>words _Morro&grave;, morro&grave; dunque tacendo_, the voices move through a<br/>series of sonorities beginning with</p><p>A#4 C#4<br/>F#4 G#4<br/>C#4 E#4<br/>F#3 C#4</p><p>Doni analyzes this passage as representing, in Watkins&apos;s words, &quot;a<br/>transposition from C Lydian to C# Lydian&quot; -- the Lydian mode, in<br/>Doni&apos;s neo-Classic naming scheme, meaning the C mode, or Ionian in the<br/>usual system.[12]</p><p>Such a passage could be played without problem on a Neapolitan<br/>chromatic harpsichord with its 19-note compass in 1/4-comma meantone,<br/>as well as on the circulating 31-note keyboards of Vicentino and<br/>Colonna, or the 19-tet keyboard of Costeley.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>2.3. Colonna&apos;s 31-note circumnavigation<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>While I am not aware of any cycle of pieces from the Manneristic Era<br/>with finals on all 31 steps of Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo or Colonna&apos;s<br/>Sambuca Lincea, the latter composer did include in his treatise of<br/>1618 an &quot;example of circulation&quot; demonstrating the free transpositions<br/>available on such an instrument.</p><p>Starting and concluding with a sonority on C -- thus making the mode<br/>in effect Ionian -- Colonna&apos;s piece moves through cadences in a chain<br/>of fifths down or fourths up visiting each of the 31 steps.[13]</p><p>For Colonna, such &quot;circulation&quot; was only one aspect of the instrument<br/>and its tuning system, with counterpoint after the ancient Greek<br/>genera and expressive fifthtone passages as other main attractions.</p><p>However, it is interesting that the first known European keyboard<br/>piece to illustrate a circulating temperament should (to my best<br/>knowledge) be based on a circumnavigation not in 12 fifths, but in 31.</p><p>(To be continued)</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/7/1999 12:14:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;M.
