The great thing about sharps and flats is that<br/>&gt; don&apos;t look anything like each other<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I totally agree. We have tried to maintain that principle as much<br/>&gt; as possible with sagittal. But you would appreciate that when we come<br/>&gt; to notating something as extreme as degrees of 612 or 665-tET where<br/>&gt; there are up to 126 divisions _between_ a sharp and a flat it starts<br/>&gt; to get a little difficult to find symbols which look sufficiently<br/>&gt; different from one another (and from all the other myriad symbols one<br/>&gt; may find on a music staff) and yet which form some kind of orderly<br/>&gt; progression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We figure that if two symbols are likely to be confused with each<br/>&gt; other they had better be close together in pitch so the result isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; too disastrous. e.g. missing an accent mark that represents a schisma<br/>&gt; (about 2 cents) isn&apos;t going to bother too many listeners in most contexts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We are definitely still open to suggestions for improving sagittal. We<br/>&gt; think we&apos;ve done a reasonable job, although you can&apos;t tell this from<br/>&gt; the attempted ASCII representation of the symbols. Looking at the<br/>&gt; actual graphical symbols on Scala&apos;s Chromatic Clavier or Staff window<br/>&gt; will give a better idea. Unfortunately Scala doesn&apos;t yet have all the<br/>&gt; symbols required to do 612 or 665. Also you&apos;ll probably get an error<br/>&gt; message if you try to generate the full 612 or 665-tET in Scala,<br/>&gt; although you can set up a scale with the pitches from from say C to C#<br/>&gt; without any problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d also like to point out that, although someone may be able to come<br/>&gt; up with a set of symbols that are more differentiated than the<br/>&gt; sagittal ones for any _particular_ tuning, they are unlikely to form<br/>&gt; part of a _universal_ notation system where they have uniform meanings<br/>&gt; across all tunings. We believe we have come up with a system that has<br/>&gt; maximum differentiation for the simpler tunings, with differentiation<br/>&gt; degrading gracefully as tuning complexity increases.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The sagittal system of symbols has something in common with chinese<br/>&gt; characters. Each sagittal symbol is a different combination of a few<br/>&gt; common strokes, where the strokes themselves look as different as<br/>&gt; possible from one another.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
