The cool thing is, they&apos;re starting to do more<br/>original music to accompany the poetry, and they&apos;re using a program<br/>called Acid to construct some interesting tunes of their own. The<br/>microtonal slant? I am starting to record on some of their tunes, and I<br/>just did a session last night where I used the 34 tone electric to lay<br/>down a long track...it came out rather well. Also, they&apos;ve used my piece<br/>&quot;Swing 19&quot; a couple of times, and I foresee more involvement on my part<br/>in the future. It&apos;s on KUVO, and go to <a href="http://KUVO.org">KUVO.org</a> to pick up their<br/>streaming signal...you might like it...Hstick</p></div>
