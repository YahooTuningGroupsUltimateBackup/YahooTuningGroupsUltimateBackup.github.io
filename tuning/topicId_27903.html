A beatless<br/>octave is impossible, so the decision involves the tuners judgement.  The<br/>middle of the piano is usually able to be tuned with nearly a 2:1 octave, but<br/>as you progress upwards, keeping this width will cause the double and then<br/>the triple octaves to sound flat.<br/>   Our teaching at the North Bennet School had us tuning the octave, then<br/>checking it against the fifth and fourth that the new note formed, and then<br/>checking to see that the new note continued the even progression of thirds,<br/>tenths, seventeenths.  It is not usually possible to satisfy all these checks<br/>with one pitch, so compromises are made.  Sometimes the fifths would need to<br/>be slightly out of line to keep the thirds even enough, sometimes the octave<br/>will need to be slightly wider to keep the fifths clear.<br/>    I am usually tuning 6:3 octaves by the time I reach the top of the piano.<br/> Making a smooth transition from the 2:1 in the middle to the 6:3 at the top<br/>is where experience comes in.  Done properly, all the octaves sound alike,<br/>though a careful ear will hear the beating in the single octaves above the<br/>fifth octave of the piano.<br/>  In the bass, the amount of stretch depends on the usage. Recording studios<br/>require less stretch down there to keep the bass guitars happy,  but on the<br/>concert stage, I prefer to do the same thing as I did in the treble, just in<br/>reverse!.  You can&apos;t hear a fifth&apos;s tempering in the bottom two octaves, and<br/>the thirds are just a mish-mash of critical band noise. However, those  6ths<br/>and 17ths can be heard to beat easily and that is how one may line the<br/>octaves up as the pitch goes low.<br/>   Melodically,  the excessive stretch works, but the price is paid in<br/>harmony.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=27905 href="#27905">ðŸ”—</a>Latchezar Dimitrov &#x3C;latchezar_d@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2001 2:55:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- <a href="mailto:a440a@aol.com">a440a@aol.com</a> a &iuml;&iquest;&half;crit&iuml;&iquest;&half;: &gt; Greetings,<br/>&gt;     There are many different octave widths used in<br/>&gt; a piano.
