For example his<br/>identification of Douglas Leedy, one of our finest composers, as &quot;a<br/>microtonal bibliographer&quot;. If we want our interests taken seriously<br/>outside of our small circle, we have to demonstrate our seriousness<br/>and respect by at least trying to keep things accurate.</p><p>For a long period McLaren managed to foist things onto this list<br/>without ever lowering himself to actually becoming a member. In this<br/>way, he could spout out all he wanted without ever having to take<br/>responsibilty for his writings, that is, by answering criticism in a<br/>civil dialogue.  Instead, when he happened to hear of criticism, he<br/>would reply with invective. In my case, by making exactly this<br/>complaint about McLaren, the list received a public attack about<br/>myself and my music -- of which he had probably never heard one note -<br/>- that had no factual basis and, in its www immortality, has caused a<br/>demonstrable injury.</p><p>I would be delighted if McLaren would condescend to join the group<br/>and actually discuss matters. If he&apos;s capable of it, his own work<br/>might be even improved by some dialogue.  For example, I&apos;d like to<br/>suggest some improvements to his German translations in his extensive<br/>bibilography, some of which are misleading if not plain wrong. For<br/>example, he translates the _Tonbeziehungen_ (Tone Relations or<br/>Relationships)as Tone Manifestation.</p><p>In addition, you have to wonder why someone would cultivate a writing<br/>style imitating that of Ivor Darreg, especially when one has not had<br/>to suffer the indignities of Darreg&apos;s life?</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;     My biggest gripe with McLaren Article is its complete bias to<br/>ET.<br/>&gt; After all being the first to build an instrument in the the<br/>complete CPS<br/>&gt; is just as important as any ET.

Somehow, I never yet to hear any of Leedy&apos;s music and<br/>only think I saw a score or two (which I no longer remember).  So it does not<br/>seem to me that Brian McLaren is &quot;plain wrong&quot; in describing Leedy as &quot;a<br/>microtonal bibliographer.&quot;  Indeed we all have different taste.  I am also &quot;a<br/>microtonal bibliographer,&quot; even if this does not present the full picture of<br/>my person, or even a primary one.</p><p>McLaren actually encouraged me to belong to the list.  He sent me a floppy<br/>disc with a year&apos;s worth of list discussion.  After that, I was egged on to<br/>get my fledgling internet skills in tow.  He is one of the pioneers of this<br/>list, no?</p><p>Re McLaren&apos;s &quot;Darreg-esque&quot; writing style, I&apos;m not sure Darreg himself needed<br/>to be in any particular style because of life experience.  Simply put,<br/>McLaren is acerbic if not acidic, provocative if not incendiary, and<br/>accomplishing if not exhaustive.</p><p>Most recently, McLaren released a CD with representation of many others, some<br/>from this list, and sent it out gratis.  It is this selflessness of spirit<br/>that makes him a valuable force in our sphere.  Regarding Daniel Wolf&apos;s<br/>concern that McLaren doesn&apos;t take his criticism fairly, I can only report<br/>anecdotally that I have certainly had opportunity to rip into his more<br/>audacious comments both in person and by telephone, and by letter.  He has<br/>always reconsidered his positions, often changing them, as a result.</p><p>Re music composition...hmn....how do you tell someone you don&apos;t care for<br/>their music when you really like the person.  (very difficult, but it has to<br/>happen if you really like the person)  When you are not honest over a long<br/>period of time, it seems akin to a disorder that develops and gets worse.<br/>It&apos;s not much easier to tell total strangers, let alone people you don&apos;t get<br/>on with, that you don&apos;t care for their music.</p><p>Remember all those doctoral candidates who claimed they will wait until after<br/>they get their PhDs before they write articles about what they &quot;really&quot; mean.<br/> (well, I do)<br/>It never happens, if rarely.  McLaren, however, gives us polemics like a true<br/>Clinton.</p><p>Unfortunately, McLaren does get mean and he won&apos;t be the first or last to<br/>upset.  However, I think genuine inaccuracies in McLaren&apos;s compilations<br/>should be put onto the list and rigorously evaluated.  McLaren will surely<br/>recalculate.  I am also disturbed by McLaren&apos;s false assertion which are on<br/>the web.  Daniel also puts his opinions on his web site and I do not approve<br/>of his assertions, yet am helpless to do anything about it.</p><p>IMHO, there are many different personalities abounding, and we need to keep<br/>the big tent and not allow visceral difficulties to turn into unprofessional<br/>animosities.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=18819 href="#18819">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/16/2001 7:04:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; IMHO, there are many different personalities abounding, and we need<br/>to keep<br/>&gt; the big tent and not allow visceral difficulties to turn into<br/>unprofessional<br/>&gt; animosities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Johnny,</p><p>I want to warmly thank you for the openness and depth of good spirit<br/>you display in this message. It is indeed challenging to overcome<br/>these shadows of the past. And my feeling is that we need each other<br/>more than we don&apos;t.

I believe our cause must<br/>outweigh any bad feeling left over from all this, although I&apos;m not<br/>sure what the complete answer is, if indeed there is one.</p><p>What I do recognize as a relatively newcomer to this virtual internet<br/>world, is that generosity of spirit, and mutual patient<br/>understanding, is what will create an environment that is positive<br/>and inclusive to all, and will cause more people to look toward what<br/>we do, where factionalism or continued stirring of the sediments of<br/>the past will perpetuate the opposite.</p><p>I must openly admit to a bit of deep sadness in coming into this<br/>world I had not known before Joe Monzo made me aware of it, to find<br/>the divisions I see.

I&apos;ll repeat it: McLaren never<br/>condescended to actually join the list. He would send his missives to<br/>the list via friends. If you found something you liked or disliked in<br/>what he wrote, found something to be corrected, explained or expanded<br/>upon, he left no means of responding directly, and no assurance that<br/>he would condescend to read any responding post. This is the<br/>intellectual equivalent of hit and run driving.</p><p>When I make a statement on the list or on my web site, it&apos;s under my<br/>name and email address and I&apos;m ready, available, and pleased to<br/>correct it. For example, earlier this week Graham corrected some cent<br/>values in a table I posted, and I&apos;m grateful for the correction.  I<br/>indicated that I thought Krenek&apos;s 13tet experiment was in a<br/>particular work, but Dan Stearns had another idea. I&apos;m eager to learn<br/>which was correct. (Okay, I&apos;ll admit it: with Krenek&apos;s music, &quot;eager&quot;<br/>is, for me, a relative term).</p><p>When I post an opinion to this list or on my web site, I hope that I<br/>have adequately qualified it as an opinion rather than a factual<br/>statement.  If my statements of opinion are based on errors of fact,<br/>I beg to be corrected. Otherwise, I stand by them and my email<br/>address is there if you disagree.  Maybe you can persuade me<br/>otherwise.</p><p>If you will read any of our discussions in the past, Johnny Reinhard,<br/>you will see again and again that I have criticized your scholarship<br/>for turning opinions, however reasonable they may be, into factual<br/>statements.  Such a critique does not in any means lower my<br/>estimation of the substance of your work, it just begs for some more<br/>honesty with regard to the nature of the conclusions.</p><p>With the case of McLaren&apos;s downgrading of Leedy to &quot;microtonal<br/>bibliographer&quot;, given the fact that both are Oregonians, McLaren knew<br/>exactly what he was doing when he made the slight.  It&apos;s your own<br/>loss that you have corresponded with Leedy and NOT asked more about<br/>his music.  The JI string quartet (in XH IX) is a minimal landmark,<br/>the harpsichord books in JI and meantone (both Fallen Leaf press) are<br/>fine works, as is the Symphoniae Sacrae (also Fallen Leaf).<br/>Pastorale, after Horace for choir and JI piano, four hands, is<br/>extraordinary.  (Kraig Grady - can you back me up on this?)</p><p>As to Darreg&apos;s writing style.  Darreg was an extremely bitter man who<br/>felt tremendous neglect and injustice.  He lived for decades in<br/>poverty and in ill health, without a car in an LA where the red cars<br/>had long vanished.  He admitted that his writing style emulated the<br/>journalism of the Hearst papers from his childhood and Hayakawa-style<br/>semantics.

The whole package, the life and the writings, was of a<br/>piece with the original content, so the reader is content to puts up<br/>with it. With McLaren&apos;s printed screams, on the other hand, I am much<br/>less generous.</p><p>Finally, one of McLaren&apos;s missives identified me as a &quot;serialist&quot;.<br/>For the record, although I have a scholarly interest in 12-tone<br/>serial techniques and admire much music using such techniques, the<br/>closest I&apos;ve ever come to writing in this tradition is to be found in<br/>the following 45-second bagatelle:</p><p><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/In%20Bregaglia.pdf">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/In%20Bregaglia.pdf</a></p><p>Was it for this bit of sentimentality that I was branded<br/>a &quot;serialist&quot;?</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=18857 href="#18857">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2001 6:49:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>List!<br/>    I know of Doug Leedy First through &quot;Entropical Paradise&quot; which was a<br/>widely distributed Box set of electronic music he did at UCLA.

I&apos;ll repeat it: McLaren never<br/>&gt;  condescended to actually join the list.</p><p>Perhaps you do not see the irony in the above statement.</p><p>Moving on...Ivor Darreg was a friend of mine.  He was not bitter, so much as<br/>fragile.  He had a keen paranoid sense that kept him alert and safe.  His<br/>condition seemed to be one of arrested development, a kid in an adult body.<br/>When I sent him a child prodigy student of mine, he could not relate<br/>directly, which I thought curious.  When I asked him where he wanted to go<br/>while on a visit to San Diego, he said &quot;the Aquarium.&quot;  Without a car, Ivor<br/>had never had the opportunity to make it to the Aquarium in San Diego.  Too<br/>bad it was closed that day.  Ivor was visually shaken by its closure.</p><p>On a web site, I suspect put up by McLaren, an article by Darreg speaks of my<br/>invitation for him to come to New York to be part of the an AFMM Microfest<br/>Symposium, featuring many luminaries.  The article (which I prefer not to<br/>point to) gives a false rationalization by Darreg for why he could never fit<br/>into the tight strictures of my New York concerts.  Basically, he was afraid<br/>to fly in an airplane.  I knew this early on and tried every which way to<br/>evade and circumvent his fear.  When Ivor backed out he was relieved and I<br/>understood.  But the web site doesn&apos;t reflect the above perspective.  Add to<br/>the list of perceived misrepresentations.</p><p>McLaren did produce Ivor&apos;s compositions in the best form they have ever<br/>received.  Thanks to McLaren&apos;s efforts, enthusiastically supported by Ivor,<br/>he is a recorded composer, in the popular sense.  Frankly, I had difficulty<br/>taking Ivor seriously as a composer until I could find and perform a select<br/>number of pieces that showed acumen and had an even consistency.  He was many<br/>things, including theorist, linguist, mathematician, etc.), but it is<br/>composer that most excited him, and which he most identified.  His production<br/>of his own stuff was often out of tune and poorly constructed, partly out of<br/>economics and partly out of chic, but mostly because he was a pioneer.</p><p>But he was not bitter, just whiny, mostly because that&apos;s the way his voice<br/>sounded.  His audio cassette openings beginning...&quot;This is Ivor Darreg....&quot;<br/>is still ringing in  my ear.</p><p>So....we see people differently.  One man&apos;s condescension is another man&apos;s<br/>criticism, or is it the other way around?  We can project onto others things<br/>for which they are innocent.  It makes it more difficult to condemn in them<br/>what is indefensible, more so than the physical lack of representation on a<br/>tuning list.  McLaren didn&apos;t have a telephone for years: as a recluse, he is<br/>surely not the only one.</p><p>Daniel Wolf, I thank you for your criticism on my work as well.  To disprove<br/>your acceptance of received German wisdom, I researched for a week in<br/>Germany.  Thank you for the push.  However, sometimes criticism can be badly<br/>delivered.  I recognize that the academic world can be chillingly surgical in<br/>its biting criticism, and I understand the abhorrence of speculation as fact<br/>is potentially risky to the naive, but this list is a place to dream, as well<br/>as a forum to inform, and (perhaps inadvertently) to incite.</p><p>&quot;...begs for some more honesty with regard to the nature of the conclusions.&quot;<br/>  ?</p><p>Let us not forget that some of us are the Partches and Darregs of latter-day<br/>generations, while some of us will leap frog beyond what the pioneers<br/>imagined.

That he mentioned Partch along with the feast of ET<br/>people still seems &quot;biased&quot;:). He did include a lot that I had not seen<br/>other places. That he has turned out some interesting music is his main<br/>contribution.<br/>    I met Ivor A few years before i met Erv. He loved Puns to the point<br/>you couldn&apos;t stand it and I played on a couple of his shows when I was<br/>first starting out. As much as McLaren did with Ivor s music that had to<br/>be done and he did it, is the fact that a large part of Ivors artistic<br/>statements was the crudeness of his materials. It was almost a Punk Rock<br/>aesthetic. He calls something a lullaby and make it the harshest thing<br/>he could. Then he would laugh when he would see you twitch. He liked the<br/>distortion on his tapes and amplifiers as far as i could tell. He<br/>enjoyed and was quite aware of when he was being annoying.</p><p>&quot;D.Stearns&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If there was a slant I think it was in the direction of the audibly<br/>&gt; *xenharmonic*; hence the more glowing praise of say Partch and the<br/>&gt; practitioners of decidedly non-12 equal temperaments, etc.</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;My biggest gripe with McLaren Article is its complete bias to ET.&gt;&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
