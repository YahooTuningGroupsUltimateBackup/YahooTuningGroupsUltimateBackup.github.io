The best example was the late Suhardi, who, in advance of any concert, would retune his own gamelan (the one rehearsed on, in his home) to the laras of the gamelan to be used in the concert.  He could recall the tunings of each of the important gamelans in town (he demonstrated this on a siter, to me) and had different strategies for playing or singing in tune with each of them, all of which he insisted on rehearsing.  Of course, retuning your gamelan for every concert is a big deal -- all of his iron instruments were quite dented from being hammered into tune, and his bronze gender had holes like swiss cheese on the ends and in the middle of each bar from the constant re-tuning.  (Needless to say, the constant changes in shape of bars or gongs constantly changed the timbres as well, one reason for which I am very cautious about over-specific claims of the effects of timbre on gamelan tuning). One of the most amazing things I&apos;ve ever experienced.</p><p>The lessons I drew from Suhardi were these -- not all Javanese were sensitive to tunings, most, especially singers, were sensitive to general tessitura (is the tuning especially high or low?) and tones in particular gamelan that were too high or low, but a few were very sensitive, indeed obsessive;  differences in melodic interval sizes were remarked up more than the qualities of intervals played simultaneously except for the gender seleh and the open strings of the rebab, in which cases, beatless intervals were preferred; and the main effect of the metallic timbres and near-unisons was not to push the tuning in any way in particular (i.e stretching or shrinking) but rather to allow the tuner to cover-up whatever compromises were needed in order to temper the scale to accommodate playing in all three pathet.</p><p>djw</p></div><h3><a id=72560 href="#72560">ðŸ”—</a>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2007 1:31:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Herman,</p><p>Interesting. I expect that is true of most musicians who<br/>learnt at an early age, whether they are stronger in AP or RP.</p><p>Perhaps more evidence that it is actually learnt<br/>can come from untrained adults singing monophonic<br/>chants - often a few men if they can&apos;t sing an<br/>octave below may sing a 3/2 below, not intentionally<br/>for effect - they believe that they are singing the<br/>&quot;same notes&quot; as the women voices.</p><p>Perhaps it is learnt at an even younger age than AP<br/>for children who are very musical from a very early age,<br/>so early that one can&apos;t remember acquiring it.</p><p>For me the similarity is mainly due to the shared partials,<br/>to the extent that on the recorder, I listen out for the 2/1<br/>partial to help pitch the octave exactly. Though in my<br/>training in mental play that I&apos;m doing right now -<br/>when playing back music in my mind I can easily play<br/>a tune on parallel octaves, e.g. on recorder + harp<br/>say, indeed, on instruments two or more octaves<br/>apart such as recorder + double bass,<br/>so obviously I have some idea of what they are<br/>somewhere independent of the shared partials. I can&apos;t<br/>play it back in parallel multiples of 3/1s easily. Perhaps<br/>because you seldom hear tunes  played in parallel<br/>3/1s.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if that is evidence that it is somehow<br/>built in, as it may just because one so rarely hears<br/>tunes played in parallel 3/1s.</p><p>Robert</p><p>&gt; The way I perceive things, the 3/1 similarity is of an entirely<br/>different kind from the 2/1 similarity. Notes a 3/1 interval apart share<br/>many of the same partials, if they are harmonic sounds, so if the 3rd<br/>harmonic is prominent in the lower note, it&apos;s possible that some general<br/>similarity may be perceived. But the difference between notes an octave<br/>apart is almost more a difference of timbre than pitch. Except in the<br/>extreme ranges (where pitch sensation starts getting &quot;muddy&quot; in the<br/>lower octaves and vague or indistinct in the higher octaves), an A<br/>sounds like an A, a C# sounds like a C#, and the notes don&apos;t even need<br/>to share partials to sound similar in that way. I&apos;ve just always assumed<br/>that everyone perceived sounds this way (even if they couldn&apos;t identify<br/>a pitch by name).</p></div><h3><a id=72561 href="#72561">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2007 4:43:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s Lou Harrison on AP: <a href="http://renewablemusic.blogspot.com/2007/07/neural-exhaustion-industrial-orchestras.html">http://renewablemusic.blogspot.com/2007/07/neural-exhaustion-industrial-orchestras.html</a></p></div>
