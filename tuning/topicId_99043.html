Those of you that have, have you noticed any trends in the responses?</p><p>What&apos;s been nagging me for a while is that for all the theories that get discussed here, there seems to be very little consensus both on list and off over &quot;what sounds good&quot;--even when &quot;stylistic&quot; considerations are accounted for.  On this list alone, there is a huge diversity of tuning preferences and one person&apos;s &quot;out of tune&quot; is another person&apos;s &quot;perfect harmony&quot;.</p><p>In the &quot;real world&quot;, one thing I notice with overwhelming frequency: if I sit someone down (usually a non-musician) and play them some chord that differs blatantly from a familiar 12-TET chord--even if it&apos;s a 5-limit JI major triad--my listener thinks it sounds &quot;out of tune&quot;.  Yet if I play them a complete piece of microtonal music, they *don&apos;t* think it sounds out-of-tune, even if it really is (i.e. something in Mavila).  They think it sounds &quot;weird&quot; or maybe &quot;ethnic&quot;, but not &quot;out-of-tune&quot;.</p><p>Another thing I notice, specifically with guitarists, is that they don&apos;t give a damn how allegedly &quot;in-tune&quot; a system is, they really only care how many frets there are, because to them anything non-12 is all lumped together and all they care about is how scary the guitar looks.  Of the five or six guitarists to pick up and play my microtonal guitars, even after I&apos;ve demonstrated the properties of each, not a single person has preferred 19 to 16.  I have good reason to suspect that 15 would go over even better, and 13 or 14 maybe better still.</p><p>I know Mike has mentioned that his music friends usually seem less than turned on by microtonal music, even really in-tune stuff like 22-EDO.   This is the real crux for me: if psychoacoustics is really important, shouldn&apos;t there be almost universal preference for more in-tune systems and almost universal aversion to not-so-in-tune systems?  In reality it seems like psychoacoustic considerations rarely do better than random chance at predicting alternate tuning system preferences, though they do corroborate the overwhelming preference for 12-TET and/or meantone.</p><p>Over the years, theorists have claimed varieties of different tuning systems as the &quot;natural&quot; evolution from 12-TET; we&apos;ve got the Inteas/Pentadecaphonic people claiming it&apos;s 15, Armodue claiming it&apos;s 16, the whole 19-TET cult of Yasser et al., Huygens-Fokker et al. with 31-TET, and maybe we can even count Paul Erlich with 22-EDO (there may be others I&apos;m missing).  Oh, let&apos;s not forget the quarter-tone people (Carrillo, Haba, etc.), or BP, or John O&apos;Sullivan.  Looked at together, these tunings all have very little in common--so why the diversity?  12-TET took the world by storm with very little resistance, suggesting it dovetailed snugly with the preferences of a vast majority, so why is consensus on non-12-TET tunings so rare?

They didn&apos;t have<br/>helicopters flying overhead diffracting all of the harmonics as they<br/>passed by. I&apos;m pretty sure they didn&apos;t have Scala. They could maybe<br/>hear glimmers of 3 and 5 in ordinary sounds if they concentrated, but<br/>they barely had exposure to 11 and 13 at all.

Until we can figure<br/>out how to establish a &quot;key&quot; in novel tuning systems, and even better,<br/>until we can figure out how to establish a concrete sense of &quot;mode,&quot;<br/>we&apos;ll be forever running up against a wall in our exploration of novel<br/>temperaments.

That what we call 5/4 is actually<br/>&gt; 81/64 or something?</p><p>What I&apos;m getting at is Ancient Greece was sort of the &quot;primordial soup&quot; of tuning, out of which came the precursors to meantone and 12-TET in the form of Pythagorean tuning.  There were many possible roads that the multitudes of scales (such as those of Ptolemy and Archytas) Western civilization could have gone down.  Hell, several could have been pursued at once...but they weren&apos;t.  Despite the fact that there was ample knowledge of Just intonation, all tunings eventually fell before the juggernaut of the Pythagorean diatonic scale.</p><p>I guess what I&apos;m really getting at is, if psychoacoustics (as we understand it) is really so fundamental, what kept people from basing scales on other simple ratios--or rather, what kept those scales from catching on?  Nowadays we can point to the various 12-TET-based infrastructures and bemoan the cultural inertia that makes them so stuck, but back in the ancient times, there were no infrastructures.  There were just peoples&apos; preferences.</p><p>If you look around the world at all the various indigenous musical tunings, pretty much the only tunings that are supported by psychoacoustic principles are 12-TET/meantone/Pythagorean.  Maybe some middle-eastern scales too, but not so much the scales of the South-East (Thailand especially), or South America, or Africa (the Chopi come to mind), or the South Pacific (the Sundanese/Balinese/Javanese gamelan traditions).  Doesn&apos;t it seem odd, if you believe that the &quot;naturalness&quot; of simple ratios explains the evolution of meantone, that no one ever discovered Porcupine or Magic or Srutal (*especially* Srutal)?  Sure, meantone is psychoacoustically &quot;better&quot; than all of those, but all of them seem more psychoacoustically &quot;valid&quot; than the various scales of the non-Western world.  I mean, if the things we claim to understand about the psychoacoustic basis of Western scales really hold true across humanity, why don&apos;t any of the traditional non-Pythagorean systems fit similar patterns?  Why should an exo-temperament like Mavila be more-or-less &quot;found in the wild&quot; while Porcupine isn&apos;t?  Why is Thai traditional music in 7-EDO?  Why are there neutral intervals in middle-eastern music?</p><p>If psychoacoustics cannot help us answer these questions, I don&apos;t think it will be very useful as a guide to finding new tunings that people will like.</p><p>&gt; I put plenty of stock into psychoacoustics, but I am well aware of<br/>&gt; HE&apos;s flaws and wouldn&apos;t use it as a measure to actually predict how<br/>&gt; good or bad things will sound. It&apos;s an ultra-simple proof of concept<br/>&gt; model that aims to test the hypothesis that 5/4 colors the sound of<br/>&gt; 81/64 and similar stuff like that. That&apos;s about it. It doesn&apos;t take<br/>&gt; into account learning, and Paul has never claimed that it did.</p><p>So...what pyschoacoustic theories do you put more stock in, as far as explaining peoples&apos; musical preferences?</p><p>&gt; The subject of learning is right now dealt with, in my opinion, a<br/>&gt; handful of wildly inaccurate ideas that I am unsatisfied with but<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know how to improve on.

So I guess the tuning list is in the<br/>Pythagoras stage now, and we need to get into the Ptolemy stage. I<br/>don&apos;t know if tetrachordal structure is really what it&apos;s all about,<br/>however.</p><p>&gt; Doesn&apos;t it seem odd, if you believe that the &quot;naturalness&quot; of simple ratios explains the evolution of meantone, that no one ever discovered Porcupine or Magic or Srutal (*especially* Srutal)?</p><p>When you say &quot;Srutal,&quot; are you talking about the 10-note MOS of<br/>Srutal, or just the diaschismatic tempering in general?

They liked Mavila, and didn&apos;t mind the<br/>blown fifths, so they worked around them. I think that JI is just one<br/>sound that people can learn to like, as can they learn to like Mavila.<br/>So I think when people claim that Mavila is a &quot;bad tuning&quot; because of<br/>the flat fifths, I think they&apos;re basically just saying they don&apos;t want<br/>to learn to get used to it.

I think everyone on this list has</p><p>come up to the same question, and that&apos;s why in addition to all of the</p><p>stuff about psychoacoustics, Rothenberg keeps getting thrown around.</p><p>Rothenberg, the tritone hypothesis, etc are all basically initial,</p><p>preliminary attempts to answer that question. They do not address</p><p>psychoacoustics at all, but attempt to address the complex underlying</p><p>system of pattern recognition that belies the very cognitive structure</p><p>of music that you keep referencing.</p><p>I tend to treat Rothenberg as a fascinating misfire. I can never quite</p><p>put my finger on what it is that I don&apos;t like about it. The tritone</p><p>hypothesis, I think is far too simplistic. But these are all an</p><p>attempt to address exactly what you&apos;re talking about. I think that</p><p>where they all fail is that they overemphasize &quot;scale structure,&quot;</p><p>while not providing enough insight into the underlying mechanisms of</p><p>pattern recognition that scale structures can encapsulate.</p><p>The even bigger masturbatory theoretical question that I have is</p><p>whether or not this itself is built on something more fundamental, or</p><p>if it&apos;s all arbitrary. Since we seem to keep &quot;discovering new order&quot;</p><p>in music (like the blues), and certain things really do just &quot;work,&quot; I</p><p>think there is something more fundamental at work, and it may not be</p><p>psychoacoustics. I note that lots of my friends jumped onto Blackwood</p><p>really easily (assuming a suitable timbre), for instance, but they</p><p>hate porcupine.</p><p>&gt; I guess what I&apos;m really getting at is, if psychoacoustics (as we understand it) is really so fundamental, what kept people from basing scales on other simple ratios--or rather, what kept those scales from catching on? Nowadays we can point to the various 12-TET-based infrastructures and bemoan the cultural inertia that makes them so stuck, but back in the ancient times, there were no infrastructures. There were just peoples&apos; preferences.</p><p>Pythagoras based everything around the 3/2, and then Archytas added</p><p>5-limit stuff to it, and then it was Ptolemy centuries later that</p><p>decided music was more about tetrachordal structure and less about JI,</p><p>if I read everything correctly. So I guess the tuning list is in the</p><p>Pythagoras stage now, and we need to get into the Ptolemy stage. I</p><p>don&apos;t know if tetrachordal structure is really what it&apos;s all about,</p><p>however.</p><p>&gt; Doesn&apos;t it seem odd, if you believe that the &quot;naturalness&quot; of simple ratios explains the evolution of meantone, that no one ever discovered Porcupine or Magic or Srutal (*especially* Srutal)?</p><p>When you say &quot;Srutal,&quot; are you talking about the 10-note MOS of</p><p>Srutal, or just the diaschismatic tempering in general? Because if</p><p>it&apos;s the latter, then they definitely did discover it, that&apos;s what</p><p>tritone substitutions are all about.</p><p>&gt; Sure, meantone is psychoacoustically &quot;better&quot; than all of those, but all of them seem more psychoacoustically &quot;valid&quot; than the various scales of the non-Western world. I mean, if the things we claim to understand about the psychoacoustic basis of Western scales really hold true across humanity, why don&apos;t any of the traditional non-Pythagorean systems fit similar patterns? Why should an exo-temperament like Mavila be more-or-less &quot;found in the wild&quot; while Porcupine isn&apos;t? Why is Thai traditional music in 7-EDO? Why are there neutral intervals in middle-eastern music?</p><p>I think someone&apos;s tolerance to mistuning can vary, and hence so can</p><p>that of an entire culture. They liked Mavila, and didn&apos;t mind the</p><p>blown fifths, so they worked around them. I think that JI is just one</p><p>sound that people can learn to like, as can they learn to like Mavila.</p><p>So I think when people claim that Mavila is a &quot;bad tuning&quot; because of</p><p>the flat fifths, I think they&apos;re basically just saying they don&apos;t want</p><p>to learn to get used to it. But this doesn&apos;t mean that the concept of</p><p>harmonic series detection doesn&apos;t apply at all to the Mavila folks.</p><p>&gt; So...what pyschoacoustic theories do you put more stock in, as far as explaining peoples&apos; musical preferences?</p><p>I put stock in basic psychoacoustic ideas and concepts in general,</p><p>which means I prefer to critically analyze HE for its strengths and</p><p>weaknesses, use it for its strengths, and not think too much about its</p><p>weaknesses. I think you tend to apply a more rigid interpretation of</p><p>the HE data than many on the list. But then, after applying this more</p><p>rigid interpretation, you criticize it. I treat HE as an interesting</p><p>model that was a step in the right direction, not the end-all be-all</p><p>of music cognition.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I&apos;m just being</p><p>&gt; &gt; silly, really, because I already have the concept in my head, I just</p><p>&gt; &gt; need to get my computer set up and keep cranking examples out and stop</p><p>&gt; &gt; arguing about psychoacoustics.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Yeah, I agree. It&apos;s probably detrimental to both of our actual contributions to the field for us to keep having discussions like this.</p><p>I do think it&apos;s good to discuss theory, but I want to make sure it&apos;s</p><p>balanced with actual music at this point, or at least musical</p><p>examples. It would be really great if, in arguments about music</p><p>theory, people tried to win by constantly outdoing one another with</p><p>better musical examples to demonstrate their points. Then everyone</p><p>wins. I bet discussions here would get less heated, too.</p><p>&gt; I think the take-away point of my above ramble is that input from non-microtonalists and non-musicians is probably a better guide than input from other microtonalists, even though I think a lot of us tend to ignore or discount the opinions of our friends and family because they don&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;. In reality, their opinions are probably more illuminating that all the psychoacoustic theories you can shake a stick at.</p><p>Sure, although I think what you&apos;re really reacting against is</p><p>extremism, not psychoacoustics, and I think this attitude will also</p><p>lead to some extremist outcomes. But I do note that people seemed to</p><p>like my porcupine comma pump, and to not like my 17-tet etude.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=99064 href="#99064">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2011 11:59:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The &quot;problem&quot; is that about the only tuning system everyone on<br/>&gt; this list (and in the general public) can agree &quot;sounds good&quot;<br/>&gt; is Meantone (and to a very slightly lesser extent, 12-TET).</p><p>They do?

I<br/>&gt; &gt; think 24-tet needs some kind of do-over in terms of how the community<br/>&gt; &gt; sees it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree. I&apos;ll get right on it.</p><p>As a second note, 48-equal might be even sicker than 24. Once people<br/>get used to 24, it&apos;s only a matter of time before they start thinking<br/>about 48-equal. Not only does 48 contain 12 and 24, but it also<br/>contains 16, but in a way that relates to 12. This assumes we find<br/>ways to actually play instruments like that.</p><p>So you can merge the two systems - there are just two major thirds,<br/>and two fifths (actually three, one of them is a good father fifth),<br/>just one of them fits into the mavila/magic structure, whereas the<br/>other fits into the meantone/augmented structure. You also get negri<br/>and tetracot, which use the 16-equal major third and the 12-equal<br/>fifth. There&apos;s some other stuff too.</p><p>I can easily see everyone going the 12-&gt;24-&gt;48 route, and then the<br/>48-&gt;16-&gt;everything route. But let&apos;s hope we can get a more direct<br/>route then that out there.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=99080 href="#99080">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2011 7:52:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Re Chris:<br/>Since several flutes were apparently found at the site, I wonder if their<br/>tunings correlate much.

So for a<br/>dominant 7 chord, the prominent 3rd partial will experience almost no<br/>beating, the 5th will beat but be much softer, the 7th will beat but<br/>be even softer, etc. This pattern continues for the 11th and 13th<br/>harmonics as well.</p><p>A decently similar result applies to meantone tunings, except for some<br/>of those 5/1 is more accurate than 3/1.

It doesn&apos;t apply to tunings  where there&apos;s serious spectral<br/>dissonance in the third (or maybe fifth) harmonic(s), which is when<br/>the consideration of timbre starts to play a larger role. What will<br/>happen is that one of us on the list will screw around with 15-equal<br/>long enough to figure out how to satisfactorily &quot;hide&quot; the error of<br/>the 3/2, with vibrato or clever choice of timbre or perhaps voicing<br/>the chords a certain way, or maybe by using chorusy gamelan-esque<br/>timbres, and subsequent generations will figure out whatever we did<br/>and just teach that. If we were all playing in 15-equal or 16-equal,<br/>orchestrators might teach that you don&apos;t want to give fifths to brass<br/>instruments, or to always play them with vibrato, etc. Piano-makers<br/>might adjust the timbres of their pianos to hide the 3rd partial.</p><p>&gt; This is a non-starter if you think about it.

One idea I&apos;d<br/>suggested in the past is to design timbres in which the partials that<br/>are most likely to beat have their amplitudes lowered to be just under<br/>the masking curve of the nearest match in the tuning. So in 15-equal,<br/>we&apos;d use timbres where the 3/1 gets attenuated to fit under the<br/>masking curve at 1920 cents. If you&apos;re willing to do this<br/>electronically, you could make this attenuation only happen when the<br/>relevant notes are played, and at full volume otherwise.</p><p>&gt; In Indonesia, there&apos;s said to be considerable variation in<br/>&gt; tuning between ensembles or villages.

I&apos;ve heard this hypothesis before and I think it&apos;s hilarious.  If you&apos;re talking about the sort of &quot;motion&quot; elements of a lot of synth patches (vibratos, LFOs, filter sweeps, etc.), they&apos;re there to make up for the fact that the basic synth timbres are static and people hate static sounds.  Acoustic instruments produce sounds that morph and evolve in organic ways that synthesizers are only just now beginning to decently replicate.  And in any case, if it&apos;s the beating that people hate, well, fast LFO pitch modulation basically IS beating, even more strongly than one gets when hearing 12-TET with static synth timbres.  So you&apos;re saying that synth programming makes up for the &quot;shortcomings&quot; of 12-TET by making them worse.  That&apos;s ridiculous.  Most people I&apos;ve talked to IRL seem to hate the sound of JI with a static synth timbre much more than they hate the same sound playing 12-TET; I get comments like &quot;it sounds cold&quot; or &quot;grating&quot; or &quot;like an emergency broadcast system&quot;--some couldn&apos;t even tell a chord was being played!--and that the 12-TET sounds &quot;warmer&quot; and &quot;more organic&quot;.  People like organic complex lively evolving sounds.  That&apos;s all there is to it.  Accurate temperaments like 19 and 22 might sound even better than 12 with these timbres, but mostly because they introduce slower beating patterns that actually add to the complexity of the sound, rather than eliminating it.

You&apos;d generally have<br/>two reactions to a concept like that</p><p>1) the reaction where people think that that&apos;s heretical because it&apos;s<br/>a smearing out of the beautiful order they&apos;ve learned to perceive in<br/>music<br/>2) the reaction where people think that such smearing out can be used<br/>for novel and mindblowing artistic effect</p><p>Historically, #2 seems to have won out. I say this because #2 is<br/>comprised of two historical stages - the development of 12-tet, and<br/>the development of the regular mapping paradigm. So that&apos;s kind of<br/>cheating.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s not the beating that is unpleasant, but roughness!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/roughness.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/roughness.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...which is also explained herein as a modulatory effect.</p><p>Which it is. You have absorbed much of psychoacoustics, young<br/>grasshopper. Now if I could only get my head wrapped around<br/>philosophy...</p><p>However, two things are worthy of note:</p><p>1) I do think that Kalle might be onto something when he says that the<br/>use of synth effects might have been a lot different if we used JI.<br/>For starters, all of the old analog synths that have really &quot;fat&quot; and<br/>&quot;warm&quot; filters and all of that, and generally had some<br/>nonlinearity/saturation (read: distortion) built in, would have<br/>sounded epically insane with JI. And whenever I listen to deadmau5<br/>play major chords with unfiltered sawtooths, I know, deep down, that<br/>it would sound even more awesome if he&apos;d just throw on Hermode tuning<br/>in Logic. That is, the sterility of unfiltered timbres would be<br/>attenuated somewhat because you&apos;d also have the novel concept of being<br/>able to explore trippy buzzing/fusing/timbre-meets-chord JI whenever<br/>you want. That isn&apos;t to say that effects wouldn&apos;t still have found<br/>use, but to suggest that a purer tuning might have made a lack of<br/>effects a bit less annoying, because there&apos;d be a new &quot;effect&quot; that JI<br/>produces.</p><p>2) The difference between LFO and detuned notes is that LFO makes the<br/>entire signal beat evenly, whereas plain old detuning causes all of<br/>the partials to beat in a wildly irrational and chaotic pattern with<br/>one another. A more adept analogy might be that a chorus pedal is like<br/>timbral detuning, or some kind of mixture of AM and FM and/or chorus,<br/>etc.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t matter too much for major thirds in practice, because<br/>we&apos;re used to it, and because the major third just isn&apos;t that bright.<br/>The difference is much more noticeable with detuned fifths.</p><p>All in all, I guess what I&apos;m saying is that using JI would provide a<br/>new &quot;effect&quot; for raw synth timbres with no effects on them, which is<br/>that of perfect periodicity buzz and more apparent VF fusion and so<br/>on. Throwing on some phatty filters would make said effect amazing.<br/>Not that that wouldn&apos;t stop people from using phaser and such anyway,<br/>but it&apos;s still something we can&apos;t really do now. It might take 7-limit<br/>harmony to really make it work, fwiw.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Well, didn&apos;t you say that your friends prefer 12-equal to JI with<br/>&gt; &gt; static timbres because the result sounds more organic? If the sound<br/>&gt; &gt; is already organic, then it&apos;s a completely different test, isn&apos;t it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Organic&quot; was just one adjective thrown out.

I disliked that strongly. In general, I couldn&apos;t run the same<br/>mental circuit around it as the minor 7th in 12-equal - a circuit<br/>which involved all kinds of similarly tempered relationships. My<br/>awareness of how this interval could potentially fit with other notes<br/>in such a way as to make music wasn&apos;t just off enough from what I was<br/>expecting that it sounded &quot;wrong&quot; instead of &quot;new.&quot; The uncanny<br/>metaphor applies quite a bit here. Take that how you will.</p><p>Then I heard Ron Sword&apos;s 7-limit shrutar example on the old<br/>xenharmonic alliance ning and was converted instantly.

A better question would be,<br/>&gt; would 12-TET have been adopted if keyboard instruments<br/>&gt; had never found favor?</p><p>I&apos;d like to quote from one of the oldest recorded tuning<br/>discussions.  This is from a PDF of Bosanquet&apos;s<br/>&quot;Temperament or the Division of the Octave Part 2&quot; dated<br/>May 3, 1875.  Nothing about harpsichords, unfortunately.</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>Mr. Cummings though the harmonium (which Mr. Bosanquet had<br/>referred to as the instrument by which he had made some of<br/>his experiments) was not to be depended on for anything<br/>whatever.  It seemed never to give a chord fit to listen<br/>to, and therefore he did not think any test of that kind<br/>could be relied upon.  It gave out so many harmonics that<br/>you could not judge of any music fairly by its means.</p><p>Mr. Bosanquet said his harmonium had stood perfectly in<br/>tune for two years.  The reeds were at least twenty times<br/>as sensitive as an organ-pipe, and had remained perfectly<br/>in tune.</p><p>Mr. Cummings remarked that all the harmoniums he had ever<br/>tried seemed to give out harmonics more freely than any<br/>other instrument.  If Mr. Bosanquet&apos;s was different in that<br/>respect, he should be glad to her it.</p><p>The Chairman observed that the resultant sounds of an<br/>harmonium were generally detestable.</p><p>Mr Bosanquet said the great defect in the harmonium was<br/>that it was so sensitive to tuning, and that very fact made<br/>it so valuable to him in his experiments, because<br/>differences which the ear would not detect in another<br/>instrument became evident at once on the harmonium.  The<br/>tuning of an harmonium was far more accurate than that of<br/>organ-pipes; you could tune any quantity of the latter from<br/>an harmonium, but you could not reverse the process.  This<br/>fact made it so valuable as a means of research.</p><p>The Chairman said he had had the advantage of hearing Mr.<br/>Bosanquet&apos;s harmonium, and certainly some of the effects<br/>were exceedingly beautiful: for instance, its powers were<br/>singularly illustrated in a passage commencing the &grave;Stabat<br/>Mater&apos; of Palestrina, which was frequently quoted as an<br/>instance of the harshness of the old masters.  As Mr.<br/>Bosanquet played it, the effect was certainly altogether<br/>different---much more delicate, a&euml;rial, /spirituelle/ than<br/>he had ever heard it played.  Of course four good singers<br/>would unconsciously give the right intonation to it, as was<br/>remarked by Burney in his account of the Pope&apos;s Chapel,<br/>that the singers there unconsciously sing in what is no<br/>doubt perfect tune.  The point that remained, and the<br/>question upon which musicians seemed never to have been<br/>satisfied, was whether the mechanical difficulties of<br/>obtaining these effects were not so great as to render them<br/>useless for practical purposes.  As he understood Mr.<br/>Bosanquet, this organ required about six times the number<br/>of keys and pipes of an ordinary instrument.  Now, if the<br/>organ of St. Paul&apos;s were multiplied by six of seven, it<br/>would hardly go under the dome.  Besides that, he thought<br/>some of the combinations which had been put before them as<br/>beautiful were hideous; some of the harmonic sevenths, for<br/>instance, were extremely disagreeable.</p><p>Mr. Bosanquet said he had always found those notes<br/>disagreeable to such persons as had a strong sense of<br/>absolute pitch.  The only way to like them was to listen to<br/>the chords.  He never knew anybody who had a good ear who<br/>liked them at first.</p><p>The Chairman: Then comes the question, what is a good ear,<br/>and who has it?</p><p>Mr. Bosanquet said he had frequent experience of all sorts<br/>of people coming to hear his harmonium, and the result was,<br/>that persons with acute ears, but not much musical<br/>education, liked the chords, and always picked out the<br/>effects which he liked best himself, as the result of long<br/>custom; but persons who had the scale firmly in their<br/>heads, as no doubt the Chairman had, did not like the<br/>departure from the usual value of the notes.  They did not<br/>think of the consonance at all; the question with them<br/>being, not whether it was smooth, but whether it was what<br/>they were accustomed to.

It is interesting that the Chairman who so hated harmoniums did find some passages more agreeable on Bosanquet&apos;s, whereas others sounded &quot;off&quot; to him (like the minor 3rd and harmonic 7th, two intervals which I recall being somewhat contentious in a few discussions with Marcel &quot;Mr. JI&quot; DeVelde).</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=99518 href="#99518">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2011 1:31:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What a perfectly clear record of this ancient discussion,<br/>which has been so often repeated here.

This is from a PDF of Bosanquet&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Temperament or the Division of the Octave Part 2&quot; dated<br/>&gt; May 3, 1875.  Nothing about harpsichords, unfortunately.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt; Mr. Cummings though the harmonium (which Mr. Bosanquet had<br/>&gt; referred to as the instrument by which he had made some of<br/>&gt; his experiments) was not to be depended on for anything<br/>&gt; whatever.  It seemed never to give a chord fit to listen<br/>&gt; to, and therefore he did not think any test of that kind<br/>&gt; could be relied upon.  It gave out so many harmonics that<br/>&gt; you could not judge of any music fairly by its means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr. Bosanquet said his harmonium had stood perfectly in<br/>&gt; tune for two years.  The reeds were at least twenty times<br/>&gt; as sensitive as an organ-pipe, and had remained perfectly<br/>&gt; in tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr. Cummings remarked that all the harmoniums he had ever<br/>&gt; tried seemed to give out harmonics more freely than any<br/>&gt; other instrument.  If Mr. Bosanquet&apos;s was different in that<br/>&gt; respect, he should be glad to her it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Chairman observed that the resultant sounds of an<br/>&gt; harmonium were generally detestable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr Bosanquet said the great defect in the harmonium was<br/>&gt; that it was so sensitive to tuning, and that very fact made<br/>&gt; it so valuable to him in his experiments, because<br/>&gt; differences which the ear would not detect in another<br/>&gt; instrument became evident at once on the harmonium.  The<br/>&gt; tuning of an harmonium was far more accurate than that of<br/>&gt; organ-pipes; you could tune any quantity of the latter from<br/>&gt; an harmonium, but you could not reverse the process.  This<br/>&gt; fact made it so valuable as a means of research.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Chairman said he had had the advantage of hearing Mr.<br/>&gt; Bosanquet&apos;s harmonium, and certainly some of the effects<br/>&gt; were exceedingly beautiful: for instance, its powers were<br/>&gt; singularly illustrated in a passage commencing the &grave;Stabat<br/>&gt; Mater&apos; of Palestrina, which was frequently quoted as an<br/>&gt; instance of the harshness of the old masters.  As Mr.<br/>&gt; Bosanquet played it, the effect was certainly altogether<br/>&gt; different---much more delicate, a&Atilde;&laquo;rial, /spirituelle/ than<br/>&gt; he had ever heard it played.  Of course four good singers<br/>&gt; would unconsciously give the right intonation to it, as was<br/>&gt; remarked by Burney in his account of the Pope&apos;s Chapel,<br/>&gt; that the singers there unconsciously sing in what is no<br/>&gt; doubt perfect tune.  The point that remained, and the<br/>&gt; question upon which musicians seemed never to have been<br/>&gt; satisfied, was whether the mechanical difficulties of<br/>&gt; obtaining these effects were not so great as to render them<br/>&gt; useless for practical purposes.  As he understood Mr.<br/>&gt; Bosanquet, this organ required about six times the number<br/>&gt; of keys and pipes of an ordinary instrument.  Now, if the<br/>&gt; organ of St. Paul&apos;s were multiplied by six of seven, it<br/>&gt; would hardly go under the dome.  Besides that, he thought<br/>&gt; some of the combinations which had been put before them as<br/>&gt; beautiful were hideous; some of the harmonic sevenths, for<br/>&gt; instance, were extremely disagreeable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr. Bosanquet said he had always found those notes<br/>&gt; disagreeable to such persons as had a strong sense of<br/>&gt; absolute pitch.  The only way to like them was to listen to<br/>&gt; the chords.  He never knew anybody who had a good ear who<br/>&gt; liked them at first.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Chairman: Then comes the question, what is a good ear,<br/>&gt; and who has it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr. Bosanquet said he had frequent experience of all sorts<br/>&gt; of people coming to hear his harmonium, and the result was,<br/>&gt; that persons with acute ears, but not much musical<br/>&gt; education, liked the chords, and always picked out the<br/>&gt; effects which he liked best himself, as the result of long<br/>&gt; custom; but persons who had the scale firmly in their<br/>&gt; heads, as no doubt the Chairman had, did not like the<br/>&gt; departure from the usual value of the notes.  They did not<br/>&gt; think of the consonance at all; the question with them<br/>&gt; being, not whether it was smooth, but whether it was what<br/>&gt; they were accustomed to.  The question with him was simply<br/>&gt; one of smoothness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr. Cummings said that the chord of the sixth on Ab, at the<br/>&gt; beginning of the second page of the example which Mr.<br/>&gt; Bosanquet played, sounded to him very flat indeed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr. Bosanquet said that was Ab /raised/.  It was a curious<br/>&gt; fact, that people with highly-educated ears almost always<br/>&gt; singled out the true minor third of the chord as<br/>&gt; disagreeable.  The true minor third was always raised.<br/>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=99524 href="#99524">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2011 10:02:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, May 24, 2011 at 4:31 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What a perfectly clear record of this ancient discussion,<br/>&gt; which has been so often repeated here.
