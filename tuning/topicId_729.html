Southwest also<br/>tried to substitute any other work of his choice on the program, but again<br/>got no response. So, we are instead doing an Ives group: several of the<br/>songs, plus the 4th violin sonata (no alternate tunings there; no<br/>lawyers...!)</p><p>[U&#xFFFD;tu guno&#xFFFD;men] . . . would I were<br/>In Grantchester, in Grantchester! -- -<br/>Some, it may be, can get in touch<br/>With Nature there, or Earth, or such.<br/>And clever modern men have seen<br/>A Faun a-peeping through the green,<br/>And felt the Classics were not dead,<br/>To glimpse a Naiad&apos;s reedy head,<br/>Or hear the Goat-foot piping low: . . .<br/>But these are things I do not know.<br/>I only know that you may lie<br/>Day long and watch the Cambridge sky,<br/>And, flower-lulled in sleepy grass,<br/>Hear the cool lapse of hours pass,<br/>Until the centuries blend and blur<br/>In Grantchester, in Grantchester. . . .</p><p>When I first heard Ives recasting of these words so many years ago, I felt a<br/>familiar wrench at the pit of my stomach&#xFFFD; And though I had little doubt then<br/>(nor do I now) that arts often non-linear &#xFFFD;detachments from the physically<br/>exact&#xFFFD; hinge on a threadbare kinship of conjunct interpretation (subject to<br/>all the myriad anthropocentric contrarieties and vagaries of the general<br/>matter-of-course&#xFFFD;), that Ives could so clearly _hear_ HIS music in this very<br/>particular excerpt from Rupert Brooke&#xFFFD;s (curious) poem* spoke volumes to me<br/>as a young man about the confident navigation of certain fundamental<br/>antilogies of intellect and creativity; of understanding and attentive<br/>misunderstand&#xFFFD; For the most part I stopped listening to much music (apart<br/>from that which I am personally in the process of working on) some time<br/>ago - and yet I often find myself returning to Ives&#xFFFD; For his music has<br/>remained with me as a consistent _and remarkably flexible_ source of<br/>inspiration.** The great SOBERING jolts I&apos;d known since I was a very young<br/>boy sitting on the fence in his backyard under nothing more than the<br/>palliating athwart of an altostratus sky hung over Proctor School early one<br/>summer Sunday evening after dinner have seldom found a more confident<br/>reinforcement than the type I would glean from the &apos;Grantchester coda.&#xFFFD;***</p><p>THE PEACE OF GOD IN FIVE FLATS<br/>In the original context of Rupert Brooke&apos;s curious poem,</p><p>&quot;hear the cool lapse of hours pass,<br/>until the centuries blend and blur&#xFFFD;&quot;</p><p>unquestionably &apos;jumps of the page&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; Yet it is through the unique prism of<br/>Ives genius, that the equilibrium is altogether recast. And like another of<br/>Ives songs, Autumn (while plenty inspiriting enough in its straightforward<br/>interwoven historical testimony of two persons love and indelible<br/>understanding&#xFFFD;), the great sobering close brings more than the linear sum of<br/>its quantifiable components [i.e., more than &quot;the peace of God&#xFFFD;&quot; in five<br/>flats!]&#xFFFD; Charlie and Harmony&apos;s Autumn---Gods Autumn---Natures<br/>Autumn------TIMES Autumn.</p><p>IN SOME DEEP CURRENT OF THE SUNLIT BROWN<br/>When I look into the darkness of the dense trees I may only see the shadows<br/>and de-articulating blur of trunks and branches... But I feel something<br/>else. Focus and openness are in often antagonistic denial of each other. (To<br/>the extent that taking a forceful position for one so often seems to obviate<br/>the salient attributes of the other, and more often than not leads to some<br/>oddly inattentive extremity of strident pedantic arrogance or numinous<br/>_dogmatic_ unbosoming&#xFFFD;). Confident reinforcement of the sort I would glean<br/>from the music of Charles Ives certainly helped me... And the more I look<br/>back on it -- the more grateful I am.</p><p>&quot;Contented river!<br/>And yet over-shy<br/>To mask thy beauty from the eager eye;<br/>Hast thou a thought to hide from field and town?<br/>In some deep current of the sunlit brown&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&quot; [Robert Underwood Johnson]</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Dan</p><p>*The Old Vicarage, Grantchester</p><p>**Pieces such as The (orchestral) Housatonic and the fourth symphony finale<br/>unquestionably lead me directly towards a more decisive and thoroughgoing<br/>commitment to &#xFFFD;microtonality.&#xFFFD;</p><p>***From &quot;I only know that&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=738 href="#738">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/1999 10:38:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>THANKS DAN!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=752 href="#752">ðŸ”—</a>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>2/10/1999 11:32:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you, Dan, for a beautiful and informative homage to Ives. I would<br/>like to say that, in expressing my disappointment that the Young piece was<br/>replaced with Ives pieces, I meant no disrespect to Ives, whom I admire and<br/>whose music I love. Fortunately, I am able to hear Ives&apos;s work in live<br/>performance (and recording, for that matter), well, if not frequently,<br/>certainly not rarely. The same is unfortunately not true of music in<br/>alternate tunings, which is why I was disappointed.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
