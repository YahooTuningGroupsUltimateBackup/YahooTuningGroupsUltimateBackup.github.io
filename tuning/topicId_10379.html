I just note that in my view, what is truly<br/>&gt; special about the hexany is the number of 7-limit consonant intervals it<br/>&gt; contains (12) for the number of notes it contains (6). This feature comes<br/>&gt; out most clearly on the 3-d triangular lattice, otherwise known as the<br/>&gt; octahedral-tetrahedral (or oct-tet) lattice, which shows each consonance as<br/>&gt; a connecting line.</p><p>This stuff is really interesting, but where is the best place to go to<br/>SEE some of these lattices??  Monzo? Archive??</p><p>Help.<br/>Bozo again<br/>________________ _________ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
