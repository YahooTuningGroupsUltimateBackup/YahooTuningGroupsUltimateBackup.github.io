The math works out more easily<br/>if we use the units of a skhisma, 1/612 of an octave, so that 1 cent<br/>= 0.51 sk, so these are what I use below.</p><p>In these units, the syntonic comma (81/80) is 11 sk, the Pythagorean<br/>comma is 12 sk, and the skhisma is therefore the difference. We also<br/>therefore have that 1/4 comma meantone temperament has a fifth which<br/>is 11/4 = 2.75 sk flat. The major third is 197 sk, and so the<br/>meantone is half of this, or 98.5 sk; it is the first miracle<br/>generator.</p><p>The next miracle, with miracle generator, 2^(7/72), also works out<br/>nicely in these units, being exactly 59.5 sk. Since 5/3 is 451 sk, if<br/>we add this to 59.5 sk we get 510.5; half of this is the miracle<br/>fourth of 255.25, 1.25 sk sharp from the just fourth at 254 sk. These<br/>relationships, which are very nearly exact, illustrate why I like<br/>skhismas better than cents as units; but it is even nicer for the<br/>next miracle.</p><p>If we take as our miracle generator 2^(1/34)--one scale step of the<br/>34-et--we have exactly 18 sk. In skhismas 3 is 970 sk; (970+18)/2 =<br/>494 sk is therefore the miracle 7/4; it is 0.1 sk flat. If we<br/>interate our miracle generator within 3 we have an analogue of<br/>Blackjack; cutting the pattern off at an octave and taking a scale of<br/>68 steps gives us a Blackjack-like scale consisting of two 34-ets 2<br/>skhismas apart. If we iterate instead the miracle 7/4 within 3, we<br/>can get, for instance, a scale with steps L of 10 sk and s of 8 sk,<br/>which is 26 Ls followed by Lss, then 25 Ls followed by Lss for a<br/>total of 108 divisions of 3; if we cut this off at an octave we have<br/>26 Ls followed by Lss, then 6 Ls followed by L. It has many intervals<br/>which are justly tuned for all practical purposes, but at 68 steps to<br/>an octave its pretty well in tune anyway, of course.</p><p>I was tempted to call this &quot;moron miracles&quot; but I don&apos;t think it is<br/>quite that useless; however we are definately pushing the envelope<br/>here.</p></div>
