Ellis indicates that pianos continued to be tuned in meantone until the middle of the century, probably a geographical fringe phenomena, but one, nevertheless in which a choice had to be made between sharps and flats for each black key on the piano.

I would be<br/>hard pressed to make any sort of concrete summary of all these<br/>discussions, but I can tell you the idea that meantone is the norm<br/>just ain&apos;t so. I&apos;m saying this not to win points, just to let you know<br/>that there is a huge world out there beyond the rather narrow<br/>intellectual straight jacket of so much of what appears on this list<br/>that doesn&apos;t jive with the conclusions reached here in the hopes that<br/>it will help you to open your mind to other possibilities.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Good ensembles perform in adaptive<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5-limit JI,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Exactly.

I think the early music movement has<br/>largely failed in this respect. Part of the problem is the lack of<br/>good singers, I fear. Too much modern technique, no ears for pure<br/>tuning, no interest. Only the wind players seem good at it.</p><p>But yeah, it&apos;s a very thorny issue indeed. Yet there persists<br/>historical commentary, not only Rameau, but things like Burney<br/>describing the Italian oboist who subtly changed the intonation of a<br/>single sustained note according to the harmonic function. While I<br/>don&apos;t have time to dig through all my notes and post all the quotes, I<br/>think the sum total represent more of an indication of performance<br/>practice that is worthy of a dismissal as &quot;vague comments&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s more to JI than vertical intonation.  The diatonic<br/>&gt; scale doesn&apos;t even exist in JI.</p><p>That&apos;s putting the cart before the horse. tur enough, but it doesn&apos;t<br/>mean that a series of notes which we would identify as a diatonic<br/>scale cannot be intoned by a series of relationships governed by JI,<br/>flexible or fixed. Let&apos;s face it, intonation at this fine a level<br/>really only becomes important in a harmonic context. Except maybe for<br/>those working in the maqam traditions, whose hearing is far superior<br/>to most western musicians, but we are not talking about that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  5-limit JI is a 2-dimensional affair.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Only if you insist on restricting it to the straight jacket of<br/>&gt; &gt; fixed-pitch dodecatonic instruments,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No.  5-limit JI is a rank 2 tuning system.</p><p>Maybe we are talking about two different things. I am not talking<br/>about any tuning SYSTEM, just how to make harmony in a free<br/>environment. Just pick up the axes and play them in tune. Not always<br/>easy, but if EVERYBODY in the ensemble has the same goal, and if they<br/>have been practicing pure intonation their whole life long<br/>(practicing, as Leopold and Tartinni and Bremner tell the student to<br/>do - not necessarily always &quot;putting into practice&quot;),once you get used<br/>to it, it&apos;s not as hard at the lattice weavers would have one believe.<br/>Part of the problem is that our sense of intonation has been so<br/>polluted by ET that it is hard for us to imagine how music sounded to<br/>those who largely had never heard it. If purity is your point of<br/>departure, you push and bend to get around without tain wrecks, but<br/>you always tend back toward purity. I honestly don&apos;t know if we ever<br/>can reconstruct that. One must experience it to believe it is<br/>possible. Again, the best I can say is go to Corsica. Or go study<br/>singing in the Byzantine tradition.

What&apos;s called<br/>&quot;solmization&quot; and &quot;hexachord theory&quot; is essentially &quot;xenharmonic<br/>moving windows&quot; or a fixed JI scale that you can move to different<br/>scale degrees.  This article rejects that interpretation although I&apos;m<br/>sure I saw one that explained the same piece in terms of hexachords.</p><p>&quot;Willaert has therefore devised a means of notating comma inflection.<br/>While it is true that the exact notation of Syntonic comma inflection<br/>cannot be attained graphically, Willaert has realized that the<br/>notation of Pythagorean comma inflection certainly can.  . . . What<br/>Willaert has done is to use a traditional singer&apos;s Pythagoreanism<br/>against him by constructing a melodic matrix in such a way that its<br/>purely Pythagorean execution will actually cause the resulting harmony<br/>to be Ptolemaic.&quot;</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2008 9:49:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2008/12/19 Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;:<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  5-limit JI is a 2-dimensional affair.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Only if you insist on restricting it to the straight jacket of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fixed-pitch dodecatonic instruments,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No.  5-limit JI is a rank 2 tuning system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rank 3, unless &quot;tuning system&quot; has some special meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                Graham</p><p>Rank 3 if you count octaves as I mentioned elsewhere. -Carl</p></div><h3>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2008 2:05:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Carl,<br/>On Dec 19, 2008, at 2:22 AM, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There&apos;s more to JI than vertical intonation.

(As in the<br/>closing section of Tallis Lamentations part 1, discussed by Duffin...)<br/>In those parts, JI is a perfectly good standard, although as always at<br/>the mercy of singers and instrumentalists.</p><p>I will give a passage from Smith (1749) with my emphasis...</p><p>p.225 Section X</p><p>Of occasional temperaments used in concerts well performed upon<br/>perfect instruments.</p><p>  By a perfect instrument I mean a voice, violin<br/>or violoncello, &amp;c, with which a good musician<br/>can perfectly express any sound which his<br/>ear requires.</p><p>PROPOSITION XXII.</p><p>The several Parts of a concert well performed upon perfect<br/>instruments, do not move exactly by the given intervals of any one<br/>system whatever, but only pretty nearly, and so as to make perfect<br/>harmony as near as possible.</p><p>  For instance, If the base be supposed to move<br/>by the best system of perfect intervals (d), the<br/>other part or parts cannot constantly move by it<br/>too, without making some of the concords imperfect<br/>by a comma (e), which would grievously<br/>offend the musicians (f). Consequently if they<br/>are pleased, those intervals are occasionally tem-</p><p>p.226<br/>-pered by the upper part or parts, which therefore<br/>do not move by the same intervals which<br/>the base is supposed to move by.<br/>  Likewise if the base be supposed to move by<br/>the system of mean tones and limmas (g), the<br/>other part or parts cannot constantly do so too,<br/>without making about two thirds of all the concords<br/>imperfect by a quarter of a comma (h).</p><p>---&gt;<br/>But whenever concords are held out by good &lt;---<br/>musicians, they seem to me to be always perfect. &lt;---<br/>---&gt;</p><p>And if so, the upper part or parts cannot<br/>move by the system of mean tones, which the<br/>base is supposed to move by.  (...)</p><p>  Coroll. 2. The proposition holds true though<br/>one of the instruments be imperfect, as when<br/>the thorough base is played upon an organ or<br/>harpsichord : because the performers of the upper<br/>parts are more attentive to make perfect harmony<br/>with the base notes, than with the chords<br/>to them. Consequently those parts do not move<br/>by the tempered system of the thorough base.</p><p>  Coroll. 3. Coeteris paribus the same piece of<br/>music well performed upon perfect instruments,<br/>is more agreeable than it would be if it were as<br/>well performed upon imperfect ones, as an organ,<br/>&amp;c.<br/>  For nothing gives greater offence to the hearer,<br/>though ignorant of the cause of it, than those rapid<br/>rattling beats of high and loud sounds, which<br/>make imperfect consonances with one another.<br/>And yet a few slow beats, like the slow undulations<br/>of a close shake now and then introduced,<br/>are far from being disagreeable.</p><p>... End of excerpt.</p><p>It seems to me that &apos;Western&apos; teachings, as recorded in most textbooks<br/>for non-keyboard musicians, have remained hopelessly schizophrenic and<br/>sloppy ever since the Renaissance started to put a premium on 5-limit<br/>intervals. There was no very good and widely-known theory of tuning,<br/>nevertheless musicians got through anyway, by sensitive adjustments,<br/>to the point of producing &apos;good&apos; tuning in places where the difference<br/>is audible.</p><p>The notation is based on a diatonic scale and its transpositions,<br/>which is fine if all you&apos;re doing is melody or Medieval harmonies with<br/>a chain of pure fifths. But Renaissance theorists and many following<br/>them were kind enough to tell their readers that there was a major<br/>tone and a minor one, although notation doesn&apos;t give even an inkling<br/>of the difference. Even in the English translation of Tosi (mid<br/>18th-century) there is a nice little diagram of two diatonic scales,<br/>with their different placements of &apos;tone major&apos; and &apos;tone minor&apos;<br/>indicated. (All useless of course, as you can&apos;t learn to sing in tune<br/>with anything else just by learning major and minor tones.)</p><p>And a lot of the monochords, diatonic or chromatic, described for (one<br/>assumes) the benefit of singers and instrumentalists were laid out<br/>precisely with 5-limit intervals, apparently without the least thought<br/>of commas or temperament.</p><p>So, as a matter of historical record, for some hundreds of years, the<br/>diatonic scale *was* modelled via a small collection or selection of<br/>JI intervals. In this sense JI was a theoretical reality. You may<br/>object that it was not a very good or satisfactory theory, but it is<br/>the theory that was taught.<br/>Except for the occasional comma-pump-free passages, it cannot have<br/>been a practical reality. But JI, though a bad theory in theory,<br/>turned out to be a good theory in practice, from the point of view of<br/>musicians who used aural knowledge of just intervals to adjust their<br/>tuning without much caring if the result made any exact ratio to the<br/>previous note. Whether this adjustment which tempered the theory&apos;s<br/>just sets of pitches to the reality of musical performance was<br/>something like a linear temperament, or rather less orderly and<br/>controlled, is not something we can know.</p><p>From the modern point of view, of course this is &apos;adaptive JI&apos; with<br/>the caveat that the &apos;adaptation&apos; may be a lot more variable than we<br/>think.

They try to analyze incoming pitch roughly in attack phase, generate the nearest MIDI notes and then after few cycles when pitch can be exactly determined glide very quickly to the right frequency by Pitch Bend. This is possible thanks to hexaphonic divided pickup and sending MIDI data on six adjacent channels. Using this small trick a delay between start of incoming note to generating MIDI note can be less then 30 msec even on low strings. Despite my using of Yamaha G10 guitar controller plus G10C converter (which was quite special revolutionary concept, unfortunately not successful on the market), and G50 converter with pickup on one of my six string custom made bassguitars I&apos;m not specialist in this, I just have written some reviews for music magazines years ago.

If the<br/>portamenti are too wide as a result, yes, one can allow<br/>the attacks to wander from the source scale, and then one<br/>simply tries to minimize the wandering.</p><p>That&apos;s, as you say, assuming the source scale perfectly<br/>captures the melodic ideal.  But just as our scores do not<br/>fully capture the harmonic ideal, they may not capture the<br/>melodic.  Suppose there is a fundamental desire for two<br/>different major 7ths, depending on context.  Then it would<br/>be a mistake to try to minimize the range of pitches<br/>assigned to &quot;B&quot;.  That&apos;s just an example (though many have<br/>argued its truth), but if what I say about physiology-<br/>derived melodic factors is true, there may be a way to<br/>improve upon both harmony and melody in an adaptive tuning.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Because they have the melody in their mind.

I know of a few general principles<br/>I believe are true, but at the moment I have no suggestions<br/>for how to add them to an adaptive tuning algorithm that<br/>would be a significant improvement over &apos;narrow pitch classes&apos;<br/>for Western music.  But if you have a musician perform a<br/>lone melody and measure it, you&apos;ll get more than the notated<br/>number of pitches, that&apos;s for sure.  That&apos;s true for voice or<br/>any orchestral instrument, and it&apos;s true for maqam music as<br/>well (they do not stick to the notation).

I think<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that&apos;s false.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That depends what is included in the cultural preferences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think there are distinctly non-cultural factors at work.<br/>&gt; Limitations of short-term memory, for example, which come<br/>&gt; from our physiology.</p><p>I understand that these psychological and physiological limitations<br/>constrain for example the number of distinct notes in a comprehensible<br/>scale and so on but these are considerations that are important when<br/>we construct musical scales. Again, what I&apos;m talking about is the<br/>exact *tuning* of these scales when actual music is played. Once the<br/>musical scale is already in existence, what determines its exact<br/>preferred melodic tuning in actual performance other than the already<br/>mentioned factors of cultural preferences and narrow pitch ranges for<br/>distinct notes?</p><p>&gt; As pertains the attack/sustain suggestion, the extreme<br/>&gt; example is to put all attacks completely within the source<br/>&gt; scale (say 12-ET) and then bend sustains to JI.  If the<br/>&gt; portamenti are too wide as a result, yes, one can allow<br/>&gt; the attacks to wander from the source scale, and then one<br/>&gt; simply tries to minimize the wandering.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s, as you say, assuming the source scale perfectly<br/>&gt; captures the melodic ideal.  But just as our scores do not<br/>&gt; fully capture the harmonic ideal, they may not capture the<br/>&gt; melodic.  Suppose there is a fundamental desire for two<br/>&gt; different major 7ths, depending on context.  Then it would<br/>&gt; be a mistake to try to minimize the range of pitches<br/>&gt; assigned to &quot;B&quot;.  That&apos;s just an example (though many have<br/>&gt; argued its truth), but if what I say about physiology-<br/>&gt; derived melodic factors is true, there may be a way to<br/>&gt; improve upon both harmony and melody in an adaptive tuning.</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t it be better then to treat them as different notes at least<br/>when entering them into the adaptive tuning program?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Of course you hear the melody of your part in your mind, but<br/>&gt; &gt; is it in some exact tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely.  Human melodic pitch discrimination is almost as<br/>&gt; good as harmonic.  Actually I would guess it&apos;s better if you<br/>&gt; give normal timbres melodically and sine waves harmonically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If it is, why is it in this tuning rather than another?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the hard question.  I know of a few general principles<br/>&gt; I believe are true, but at the moment I have no suggestions<br/>&gt; for how to add them to an adaptive tuning algorithm that<br/>&gt; would be a significant improvement over &apos;narrow pitch classes&apos;<br/>&gt; for Western music.</p><p>Bear in mind that pitch classes are octave-equivalent. I prefer narrow<br/>pitch ranges for notes understood as octave-specific.</p><p>&gt;  But if you have a musician perform a<br/>&gt; lone melody and measure it, you&apos;ll get more than the notated<br/>&gt; number of pitches, that&apos;s for sure.</p><p>Pitches yes but the question is the number of distinct notes<br/>perceived. Notes allow a lot of pitch variation without becoming<br/>different notes perceptually.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s true for voice or<br/>&gt; any orchestral instrument, and it&apos;s true for maqam music as<br/>&gt; well (they do not stick to the notation).  In fact you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; find it&apos;s nontrivial even to assign discrete pitches to<br/>&gt; violin and voice performances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If the piece doesn&apos;t require any commas vanish, then John&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; COFT (calculated optimum fixed temperament) will be JI, or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; very close to it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But you said his system calculates an optimum well temperament<br/>&gt; &gt; for a piece. How could any result then be in horizontal JI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;optimum well temperament&quot; will be JI if there&apos;s no<br/>&gt; modulation.</p><p>But isn&apos;t it limited to only 12 notes then?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, does JdL:s COFT assume (melodic) octave<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; equivalence?

And not specific intervals (5:4 9:8 etc)<br/>but rather scalar intervals (3rd, 2nd etc).  The scale is the<br/>language of the melody, in other words.  Evidence for this<br/>notion includes the fact that diatonically transposing a<br/>melody to, say, the relative minor, preserves a great deal<br/>of its essence.</p><p>He further assumes that listeners do not carry out something<br/>like: &quot;I&apos;m hearing a 5:4. I know all 5:4s are 3rds, therefore<br/>I am hearing a 3rd.&quot;  Instead, it is assumed that they do<br/>something like: &quot;This one is smaller than the previous one.<br/>Therefore if the previous one was a 3rd, this one must be<br/>and 2nd&quot;. **</p><p>Now, for any scale, we can show all its intervals via a<br/>tonality-diamond-like matrix with modes on the y axis and<br/>scale degrees on the x axis.  Here we can indeed see that<br/>for the diatonic scale, all 5:4s are in the 3rds column.<br/>But since only relative sizes matter in the above, we can<br/>replace each interval listed with its size rank among all<br/>intervals in the matrix.  You can do this in Scala by<br/>choosing View &gt; Interval Ranking Matrix.</p><p>These &quot;rank-order matrices&quot; as Rothenberg calls them are<br/>thus like scale classes.  His claim is that if two scales<br/>have the same rank-order matrix, they are in a sense<br/>different tunings of the same scale.</p><p>Very clever and I think there&apos;s a lot of truth to it.  But<br/>the problem of small deviations needs to be addressed<br/>before it can be practically applied to arbitrary scales.<br/>Rothenberg used it for ET subsets (e.g. all 5-tone subsets<br/>of 31-ET).  There it works, because the 31-ET step is still<br/>fairly large.</p><p>** R. claims that in order for this to work, the scale has<br/>to have the property that no 2nd is larger than any 3rd, and<br/>so on.  Such scales are called &quot;proper&quot;.  Improper scales are<br/>predicted to be unsuitable for diatonic-like music, and<br/>instead must be used against a drone.  Again I think he&apos;s<br/>onto something, but there is likewise the problem with tiny<br/>deviations.  I believe the problem can be solved in this case<br/>by measuring, in fractions of an octave, the amount of overlap<br/>between scale degrees.  This is implemented in Scala under<br/>show data &gt; Lumma impropriety factor.</p><p>&gt; But for a  typical piece of even moderate length the matrix<br/>&gt; would be enormous.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>&gt; Some kind of iterative Monte Carlo-method might be more practical<br/>&gt; (from your description it seems JdL might use something like this).</p><p>Yup.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not much of a programmer but I have a short Pajara<br/>&gt; progression in mind which I intend to use as an example.
