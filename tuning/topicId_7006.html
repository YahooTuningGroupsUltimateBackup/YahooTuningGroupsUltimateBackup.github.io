There is a musicological point here I am not too qualified to<br/>address, but Schubert&apos;s piano music doesn&apos;t often sound like guitar music to<br/>me.  &quot;Wandering around all the keys&quot;  was a way for any early 19th century<br/>composer to create musical tension and resolution.   This was easy to do with<br/>some consistancy, since the circle of fifths based tuning was well known at<br/>the time.  I would even call it a standard arrangement that any composer of<br/>the age would have been familiar with .</p><p>   In a Young temperament,  the F#_A# third is Pythagorean, but everything<br/>else is tempered less.  It is equally important to note that there are only<br/>five keys in this tuning that have thirds that are tempered more than ET, two<br/>that are the same (14 cents wide) and the rest are tempered less than ET. A<br/>well recognized palette.<br/>   There is also the small problem of how to tune an ET on a keyboard.  We<br/>know what tuning techniques were being discussed at the time, and a clean ET<br/>would have been virtually impossible to produce with them. This weighs in on<br/>the side on non-ET pretty heavily.  Montal&apos;s instructions(1832) were in a<br/>book &quot;How to tune your own Piano&quot;, which would be of virtually no use to<br/>anyone but a professional, full time tuner, few and far between in 1820..<br/>Ellis states that in 1845,  none of the Broadwood tuners were tuning anything<br/>at all like ET.  Is it logical that Schubert had grown up around it 50 years<br/>before?<br/>        By the time Schubert was composing, keyboard temperament had settled<br/>into a well recognized form, and I think is shows in his music.  Playing his<br/>music back to back on an ET piano and a well tempered piano, pianists I have<br/>sought opinions from have immediately been attracted to the latter.  The<br/>modulations make sense in their movement into and out of differing levels of<br/>dissonance/consonance.  After a short time listening to a well-tempered<br/>version of this music,  ET sounds harsh and tedious to them.<br/>    We are going to try to include some Schubert on our next CD,  &quot;The<br/>Well-Tempered Piano&quot;.  Recording begins in June, hoping to have it in the<br/>package by next November.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div><h3><a id=7038 href="#7038">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/1999 6:50:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;WARNING: see disclaimers in TD 440.6.

The Schubert two celli Quintet would be much more more<br/>&gt;interesting -- not to mention plausible -- in adaptive JI than any of<br/>&gt;the keyboard works.</p><p>I&apos;d be glad to.  Do you happen to know of any MIDI sequences of the<br/>above works?  I&apos;ll check on <a href="http://prs.net">prs.net</a>.</p><p>Plausibility is in the ear of the beholder.  When it comes to piano,<br/>it&apos;s a shock to hear ANY movement in pitch, at first.  With strings,<br/>we have past experience with motion, vibrato and otherwise.  With piano,<br/>it takes time to get used to the possibility; once it is &quot;possible&quot;, it<br/>becomes a lot more &quot;plausible&quot; at any given moment in time.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
