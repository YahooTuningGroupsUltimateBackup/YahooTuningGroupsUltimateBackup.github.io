Feynman<br/>was one of those who, though he may not have said so<br/>himself, came at science with an artist&apos;s temperament. His<br/>way of thinking, and of attacking problems was seen by other<br/>scientists as magical and non-rational. He once said &lt;light<br/>paraphrase&gt; &quot;If mathematics had never been invented, it<br/>would have set physics back... maybe a week.&quot; &lt;/light<br/>paraphrase&gt; Yet he pooh-poohed the artist&apos;s approach to art<br/>and the world.<br/>&#x9;In my view, there is much to be gained by approaching music<br/>as you do sex. It is sometimes better not to think at all<br/>and just do it. From my own personal experience, I play and<br/>write better music when I do not have a scaffolding of<br/>theory or other distractions around it. Of course, adequate<br/>preparation is a necessity. No amount of raw emotion is<br/>going to overcome the inability to actually play an<br/>instrument or put sounds together.<br/>&#x9;Although I am perfectly capable of doing and understanding<br/>music theory, I do not. It just does not interest me much. I<br/>prefer playing, as do many others on the list. It makes us<br/>neither more or less members of the microtonal community.<br/>The ability to think in theoretical terms is useful for<br/>gaining a fuller understanding of music, but it is not at<br/>all necessary for the production of good music. What is<br/>important is that the music that is in a person comes out so<br/>that it can be experienced outside the mind of the composer.<br/>In my opinion, that is the great good this community is<br/>working.
