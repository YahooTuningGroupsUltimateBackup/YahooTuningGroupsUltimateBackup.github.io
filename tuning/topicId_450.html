Around 1300, &quot;modern&quot; theorists start to espouse the view that<br/>the fourth should be regarded as concordant when supported by the<br/>fifth below, not in itself -- but that&apos;s another discussion.</p><p>However, a wide variety of intervals with odd-limits far beyond 3 are<br/>regarded as &quot;imperfect&quot; or &quot;medial&quot; concords. The major and minor<br/>thirds (81:64, 32:27) have this status in 13th-14th century practice<br/>and theory, and combinations involving fifths and/or fourths plus<br/>major seconds or ninths, or minor sevenths, also get a somewhat<br/>analogous recognition in certain &quot;dialects&quot; of practice as well as in<br/>two treatises, one of them the monumental _Speculum musicae_ of<br/>Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325). In &quot;modern&quot; 14th-century practice and<br/>theory, the major sixth (27:16) is also regarded as relatively<br/>concordant.</p><p>Indeed Jacobus finds that even a bare major second (9:8) has some<br/>degree of &quot;imperfect concord,&quot; while 9:4 or 9:2 is a &quot;medial concord&quot;<br/>(comparable to M3 or m3), and 9:1 is actually a _perfect_<br/>concord. Like Jacobus (and evidently some composers of the 13th and<br/>14th centuries), I find 4:6:9 as quite &quot;concordant&quot; and pleasing,<br/>although unstable, at least in this medieval setting; and I find a<br/>1:3:9 as a remarkably stable concord, as Jacobus suggests by calling<br/>9:1 a &quot;perfect&quot; concord. Although a 9:1 (M23) is too wide for<br/>practical Gothic use, as Jacobus himself recognizes in remarking that<br/>a twelfth is about the limit of such practice, we might nevertheless<br/>say that his system has a 3-prime-limit, an 81-odd-limit on _relative_<br/>concord (the &quot;medially concordant&quot; ditone or M3 at 81:64), and a<br/>9-odd-limit on &quot;perfect concord&quot; (maybe roughly synonymous with<br/>stability).</p><p>At this juncture, two points may be notable from the perspective of JI<br/>theory.</p><p>First, &quot;concord&quot; can be a rather fluid and inexact concept, and<br/>medieval theorists recognize this quite explicitly by speaking of it<br/>in degrees: perfect, medial, imperfect, and the like. The modern<br/>theorist Ludmila Ulehla makes much the same point when she speaks of a<br/>trichotomy between concords, &quot;dual-purpose&quot; sonorities which can be<br/>heard as relatively blending but also to some degree points of<br/>tension, and discords. It seems to me that such a graduated approach<br/>could be valuable for various flavors of JI theory.</p><p>Secondly, at least in a Pythagorean setting, &quot;odd-limit&quot; is not<br/>necessarily a good index of concord/discord. Most notably, just about<br/>every 13th-14th century theorist agrees that a bare major or minor<br/>third (81:64, 32:27) is _more_ concordant than a major second (9:8).<br/>If we consider early 15th-century keyboard practice, where major<br/>thirds involving sharps (e.g. e-g#) are frequently realized as<br/>diminished fourths at 8192:6561, this point becomes even clearer. Of<br/>course, one could argue that 8192:6561 is only a schisma (~1.95 cents)<br/>from a simple 5:4, but within a 3-prime-limit system, it is<br/>fascinating how large integers can produce some interesting results.</p><p>(In one piece from the Buxheimer Organ Book, if one assumes this<br/>tuning, then we actually have a final sonority of a-db&apos;-e&apos;, or<br/>13122:16384:19683. Considering this, I&apos;m tempted to introduce this<br/>keyboard Kyrie setting: &quot;Here&apos;s a piece, likely from around the middle<br/>of the 15th century, in 19683-odd-stability-limit JI.&quot;)</p><p>Now for the medieval 54:64:81, one version of the _quinta fissa_<br/>described by Jacobus of Liege where a fifth is &quot;split&quot; into two<br/>relatively concordant thirds by a middle voice. At 0-294-702 cents,<br/>this 3-limit JI sonority is only about 3 cents from a 16:19:24 at<br/>0-297-702 cents.</p><p>Interestingly, while Jacobus himself prefers the major third below and<br/>minor third above, he notes that the converse is also permissible,<br/>citing the opening sonority (a-c&apos;-e&apos;) of a motet which has happily<br/>come down to us in the Montpellier and Bamberg codices. Anyone who<br/>looks through music of the period from Perotin to the early Dufay, say<br/>1180-1450, will find that this sonority is treated in practice as well<br/>as theory as unstable but relatively concordant.</p><p>What is especially interesting for me is that in early 15th-century<br/>music, where thirds are not only used in a coloristic role (a feature<br/>of 13th-14th century music also), but are becoming more and more<br/>pervasive in the texture, this 54:64:81 (minor third below major<br/>third) can sound quite smooth, I might guess somewhat smoother to my<br/>ears than 64:81:96 (major third below minor).</p><p>One contributor has suggested that 16:19:24 or 0-297-702 cents might<br/>be seen as the center of a certain narrow region of the tuning<br/>spectrum, 3 cents or so wide on either side -- which would in effect<br/>place 0-300-700 cents (12-tet) near one boundary and 54:64:81 or<br/>0-294-702 cents near the other.</p><p>To sum up, it may be a curious feature of JI systems that<br/>low-prime-limit systems (specifically Pythagorean or &quot;3-limit&quot;) may<br/>favor very high odd-limits for some _relatively_ concordant<br/>sonorities, while some relatively high-prime-limit systems may favor<br/>comparatively low &quot;odd-limits,&quot; at least in comparison to the prime<br/>limit (or &quot;cap&quot; if one prefers).</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s also the important lesson emphasized here by Paul<br/>Erlich: a &quot;spiral&quot; system such as Pythagorean tuning, if extended far<br/>enough, can produce a close approximation of just about any ratio or<br/>interval size in cents. Maybe this dialogue also invites discussion of<br/>the &quot;Just Noticeable Difference&quot; (JND), especially for vertical<br/>intervals.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=459 href="#459">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The accuracy of the ear is such<br/>that these numbers will never come up in the ratios that are important<br/>in describing how we perceive a given interval, unless additonal notes<br/>are involved with the interval in a chord of more than two notes.</p><p>The best way to approach the issue of the consonance of intervals is to<br/>imagine a dissonance as a continuous function of the size of the<br/>interval, such as the &quot;one-footed bride&quot; or any of many curves derived<br/>by Hemholtz, Plomp, Kameoka &amp; Kuriyagawa, or Sethares. Some ratios<br/>within the 11-limit might correspond to local minima in the dissonance<br/>curve, but that&apos;s all. Odd limits above 19 are certainly irrelevant in<br/>quantifying a bare interval&apos;s dissonance or consonance.</p><p>&gt;One contributor has suggested that 16:19:24 or 0-297-702 cents might<br/>&gt;be seen as the center of a certain narrow region of the tuning<br/>&gt;spectrum, 3 cents or so wide on either side -- which would in effect<br/>&gt;place 0-300-700 cents (12-tet) near one boundary and 54:64:81 or<br/>&gt;0-294-702 cents near the other.</p><p>I would agree that 16:19:24 has a special attraction within the space of<br/>possible minor chords, and attribute that more to difference tones (as<br/>Helmholtz did) and to virtual pitch psychology than to any special<br/>&quot;consonant&quot; character of the intervals 19:16 or 24:19. In fact, 19:16<br/>falls within the local dissonance minimum due to 6:5, and likewise for<br/>24:19 and 5:4, so the chord 16:19:24 is really just a detuned<br/>1/6:1/5:1/4 triad as far as beating and critical band dissonance are<br/>concerned. I know that Daniel Wolf had a problem with this the last time<br/>I said it, but as I see it, if different psychoacoustical phenomena are<br/>responsible for the relevance of small integers, then different sets of<br/>small integers can be relevant in describing the psychoacoustical<br/>properties of a chord.</p><p>&gt;To sum up, it may be a curious feature of JI systems that<br/>&gt;low-prime-limit systems (specifically Pythagorean or &quot;3-limit&quot;) may<br/>&gt;favor very high odd-limits for some _relatively_ concordant<br/>&gt;sonorities, while some relatively high-prime-limit systems may favor<br/>&gt;comparatively low &quot;odd-limits,&quot; at least in comparison to the prime<br/>&gt;limit (or &quot;cap&quot; if one prefers).</p><p>I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s really much to this observation --<br/>high-prime-limit JI systems will be at least as rich as Pythagorean<br/>tuning in intervals that happen to fall near local minima of the<br/>dissonance function despite their high odd-limit. These high odd-limit<br/>intervals are JI by construction only -- they do not have any audible<br/>properties that distinguish them from nearby tempered intervals.</p></div>
