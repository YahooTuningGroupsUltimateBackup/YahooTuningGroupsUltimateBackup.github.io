The Arabic<br/>&gt; theorists simply lengthened this chain, perhaps to justify scales<br/>&gt; already in use that didn&apos;t fit the Greek mold. There is<br/>&gt; circumstantial evidence that they stumbled upon the schisma (much as<br/>&gt; the West did later, around 1420), since they used it to construct,<br/>&gt; essentially, 5-limit just scales.</p><p>(Those who have trouble following the Greek terminology here<br/>my get some help from my &quot;Tutorial on ancient Greek Tetrachord-theory&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm</a>&gt;).</p><p>In my unpublished paper &quot;An Examination of a Possible 5-Limit System<br/>of Boethius&quot; (1997), the conclusion of which appears in my book<br/>_JustMusic: A New Harmony_, I examine the Greek-letter notation<br/>used by Boethius to describe the modes.</p><p>There, I assume that the ratios described by Didymus are used for<br/>the diatonic genus, and construct a lattice incorporating all of<br/>the pitches which occur in the complete set of all the modes.</p><p>I note how pitches which are separated by a syntonic comma always<br/>have different symbols, but those separated by a skhisma always<br/>have the same symbols.</p><p>Boethius&apos;s actual theoretical tuning of the diatonic genus supposedly<br/>would have been entirely Pythagorean (3-limit), but as Nicomachus<br/>wrote, c. 100 AD:</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Barker 1989, p. 265]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ... [the _synemmenon_ tetrachord] begins with its own _trite_<br/>&gt;&gt; a semitone away from _mese_, then, after a tone, has a _paranete_<br/>&gt;&gt; peculiar to itself, then, after another tone, has the _nete<br/>&gt;&gt; synemmene_, which is in all respects of the same tension and sound<br/>&gt;&gt; as _paranete diezeugmenon_.</p><p>And this distinction is indicated in Boethius&apos;s Greek-letter notation.</p><p>Much later (c. 900 AD), Hucbald directly contradicted this:</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Babb 1978, p 33]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ... the _paranete synemmenon_ is the same in sound as _trite<br/>diezeugmenon_.</p><p>which shows that the basic diatonic tuning had changed by his time.</p><p>The only tuning system which would have been a good candidate for<br/>Boethius&apos;s time which gives pitches matching his descriptions and<br/>notations, is that of Didymus (c. 50 BC - 100 AD), where the<br/>protypical tetrachord is [descending]:</p><p>           mese   A  n^0    1:1<br/>                                 &gt; -9:8<br/> lichanos meson   G  3^-2  16:9<br/>                                 &gt; -10:9<br/>parhypate meson   F  5^-1   8:5<br/>                                 &gt; -16:15<br/>   hypate meson   E  3^1    3:2</p><p>Boethius&apos;s description and diagrams of the modal system are<br/>in his Book 4, chapters 16 and 17 [Bower 1989, p 154-160].<br/>A link to the Latin text is given below.</p><p>Constructing lattices for each mode notated by Boethius results<br/>in a general lattice for the whole system results in pairs<br/>of pitches which are separated by a skhisma (~2 cents) but notated<br/>with the same letter, one of them occuring with the pair 3^3<br/>(= 27:16 = ~906 cents) and 3^-5 * 5^-1 (= ~904 cents), and another<br/>with the pair 3^2 (= 9:8 = ~204 cents) and 3^-6 * 5^-1 (= ~202 cents).</p><p>There are several pairs of pitches separated by a syntonic comma<br/>(= ~21.5 cents), and in every case the two notes have different<br/>symbols representing them.</p><p>Taken together, I believe the evidence of the Greek-letter notation<br/>indicates that musicians of the late classical and early post-classical<br/>period (c. 100 BC - 500 AD):</p><p>   1) utilized a system of pitches related as 5-limit ratios, or<br/>      at least tuned closely enough to them to imply them,</p><p>   2) recognized the &quot;enharmonic equivalence&quot; (in the modern sense)<br/>      of pitches separated by a skhisma,</p><p>   3) recognized a distinction between pitches separated by a<br/>      syntonic comma.</p><p>If I&apos;m correct that ancient Greek musicians *in practice* (i.e.,<br/>in their actual musical notation) recognized the skhisma, then<br/>it&apos;s no surprise at all that later Arab music-theorists picked<br/>it up, as they did so many other ancient Greek concepts.</p><p>REFERENCES<br/>----------</p><p>Barker, Andrew (ed.). 1989.<br/>  _Greek Musical Writings.<br/>   Vol. 2: Harmonic and Acoustic Theory._<br/>  Cambridge Readings in the Literature of Music,<br/>  Cambridge Univ.
