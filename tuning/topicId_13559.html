You know instruments.....synths,<br/>&gt; Guitars, tubular bells whatever and everyone be able to at least know<br/>&gt; what is going on ??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl Lumma,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s go for it!  There are all sorts of things to discuss.  How to<br/>&gt; build a Carillon (Darren, we haven&apos;t had an update in a while!), how<br/>&gt; the new tunings function musically (looking forward to the new Denver<br/>&gt; album, and kudos to Mats, Keenan and Kees for posting and discussing<br/>&gt; musical examples!), how to make xenharmonic wind chimes for your ma<br/>&gt; and pa, cool recordings that have interesting tuning stuff going on...<br/>&gt; the sky&apos;s the limit...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the sky&apos;s the limit already, isn&apos;t it? What&apos;s the restriction on<br/>&gt; this type of content as things stand? Post away. I mean it&apos;s<br/>&gt; definitely nice to see all the suggestions Pat and Carl are making;<br/>&gt; they all sound good, and hopefully they *will* inspire some to go<br/>&gt; ahead and write about them... but if the tuning list adopts a menu<br/>&gt; styled format, I&apos;m a pretty damn finicky eater, and I&apos;m pretty sure<br/>&gt; that it won&apos;t agree with my digestion!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, the sky is the limit, and these are all fine suggestions -<br/>&gt; post away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --dan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

Several key pieces<br/>are complete:</p><p>1.  8 by 16 Matrix keyboard.  (purely analog - just simple tactile swiches<br/>mounted on a board with the required wiring.)<br/>2.  Junction box for routing of above wiring and supply of 15 volt power to<br/>the solenoids.<br/>3.  Five 20 coil pickup assemblys, all hand wound with the aid of my<br/>turntable(reved up to 600 rpm with a dremel tool). (yes those old turntables<br/>still have a use!)<br/>4.  Junction box to route pickup output.<br/>5.  99 course tuned 1/4&quot; by 3/8&quot; steel bars (within 1-2 hertz)  Scale is 15<br/>limit tonality diamond, normalized in a two octave repeating scale.</p><p>The following is what remains.</p><p>1.  construction of boards to mount everything on.<br/>2.  Fine tuning (goal is within .2 hertz)<br/>3.  Assembly<br/>4.  Midification</p><p>Progress is slow mainly due to the addition of my son Ellery to the family<br/>(<a href="http://www.acceleration.net/dburgess/index.htm">www.acceleration.net/dburgess/index.htm</a> for pics of him)</p><p>Progress is also slowed by my purchase of various synthesizers and software<br/>tools, so I am partly seduced by the ease and convenience of the<br/>microtunable synth, making a very time intensive flesh and bones instrument<br/>harder to stay focused on.</p><p>Encouragement is gratefully solicited and appreciated.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>Gainesville FL</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2000 11:28:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Darren Burgess wrote,</p><p>&gt; Progress is also slowed by my purchase of various synthesizers and<br/>software tools, so I am partly seduced by the ease and convenience of<br/>the microtunable synth, making a very time intensive flesh and bones<br/>instrument harder to stay focused on.</p><p>Yes sir, I hear you. These are amazingly candid comments, and I think<br/>they really touch on some developing dilemmas of the cyber age... The<br/>carillon sounds like it&apos;s going to be awesome though, and I for one<br/>can&apos;t wait to hear it in all its flesh and ringing bones glory!</p><p>keep up the good work,<br/>--dan</p></div>
