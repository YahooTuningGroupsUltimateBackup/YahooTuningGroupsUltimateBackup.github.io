If you know for sure you are going to refret a<br/>12tet instrument, you can remove the frets and make a fretless to start<br/>with. Unless you plan to completely replace the fingerboard, this is a<br/>step you will have to take anyway. Then, you can get some thick nylon<br/>fishing line and tie it where the frets will be for your proposed scale.<br/>If the line on the back of the neck bothers you, another alternative is<br/>to give the fingerboard several really good waxings (polishing the last<br/>one well), and glue, with very little super glue, thin brass rod that<br/>can be found at hobby stores where you propose the frets will be. If<br/>done just right, the &quot;frets&quot; will stay down, can be leveled with a file<br/>if done very gently, but can be removed with a little force and very<br/>little damage to the fingerboard.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
