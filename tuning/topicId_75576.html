The source code has become too large for<br/>him to continue coding by himself, and with an infusion<br/>of investment money, we would hire a team of programmers<br/>to work under him.</p><p>But anyway, making the current version of Tonescape<br/>available for free has not resulted in the amount of<br/>use we had hoped for, because too many potential users<br/>have had problems installing it or getting it running.<br/>So we would like to migrate the graphics engine from<br/>Windows DirectX to OpenGL, but again, that requires<br/>time and programming work which we cannot do now.</p><p>&gt; As I think you already know, I do not believe your style of<br/>&gt; &quot;lattice&quot; has any theoretical merit whatsoever.  In a decade<br/>&gt; on these lists, I&apos;ve never seen anyone present a cogent<br/>&gt; argument why they do.  The best argument for them that I know<br/>&gt; of is that you think they&apos;re &apos;a great way to display the<br/>&gt; information&apos;.  But feel free to enlighten us.</p><p>Yes, well, obviously Chris felt the same way, because<br/>he didn&apos;t implement my lattice formula in Tonescape either.<br/>Instead, he used a formula which makes all axis angles<br/>as orthogonal as possible. It&apos;s obvious that for 2-d<br/>this creates a plane divided into squares, and for 3-d<br/>it creates a space divided into cubes. For higher dimensions,<br/>i can&apos;t explain what&apos;s going on, because they are ultimately<br/>still projections of &gt;3-d space down into 3-d. But Tonescape<br/>will allow the user to create Tonespaces with up to<br/>7 dimensions. For example, with a 2:1 equivalence-interval<br/>using one dimension, you could let the other six dimensions<br/>represent prime-factors 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17, giving<br/>you the full 17-limit JI with octave-equivalence.</p><p>But you aren&apos;t required to use tunings with an equivalence<br/>interval. I&apos;ve created Tonescape Tuning files for ancient<br/>Greek genera which illustrate this: they occupy the 2-octave<br/>pitch-space described by all ancient Greek theorists, without<br/>an equivalence interval.</p><p>And of course, the axes of a Tonespace don&apos;t have to<br/>represent prime-factors -- they can be anything. For<br/>example, i have Tonescape Tuning files of Brink&apos;s<br/>&quot;Pyramid of Mars&quot; tuning, which uses phi as a generator:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/m/mars-pyramid.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/m/mars-pyramid.aspx</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
