And, as &quot;Igs&quot; has shown...make too many impure intervals in a scale and you&apos;re likely to indirectly create some very near pure ones.</p><p>    .</p></div><h3><a id=88382 href="#88382">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2010 12:39:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Your JI version sounds better than the 12-tET to me.

See Tartini, early 18th century for crying out loud, for historical references to allowing the syntonic comma to shift in certain places. IIRC, his fundamental principle was maintaining pure intervals in the upper voices and the bass would do the syntonic adapting (syntonic shifting being what Marcel is actually doing whether he wants to admit it or not). Marcel should take a look at Tartini&apos;s 7th-partial proposals, too.

If string players use a wide vibrato, as long as they&apos;re in the ballpark, it really doesn&apos;t really matter what tuning system they are using. &nbsp;This was discovered by the Guarnari Quartet back in the 60&apos;s and has been imitated by chamber groups since then. &nbsp;In general, only the historically-informed groups such as &nbsp;the Quartet Mos&auml;iques and Eroica Quartet attempt to play without the soupy vibrato. And the danger you run here is that you can actually hear the tunings, and they sound unusual, so some idiot will always come along and claim that the players are out of tune. Harnoncourt had a brutal putdown of this sort of idiocy in one of his books.<br/>If Marcel were to use relatively pure sounds, I&apos;m sure the wolfs will be more apparent--if, that is, his tunings are actually accurate. &nbsp;There is a certain tolerance for wolfs in pre-dominant-type chords, so not every chord actually has to be pure. &nbsp;But some of this was taken care of by the &nbsp;inversion--a ii chord, which is hopelessly out of tune in the syntonic scale, sounds tolerable as a 6 (1st inversion chord). &nbsp;And lo and behold, ii chords in root position were relatively rare before the latter part of the Baroque period, whereas IV chords in root position were common. &nbsp;One still finds this distinction in Sechter&apos;s harmony method, one of the most influential manuals of the 19th century (Sechter was the most powerful teacher in Austria-Hungary and was the teacher of Bruckner).<br/>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p><a href="mailto:franklincox@yahoo.com">franklincox@yahoo.com</a></p><p>--- On Wed, 4/28/10, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Most common Major scale in JI<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, April 28, 2010, 7:55 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      &gt; Your JI version sounds better than the 12-tET to me.

I&apos;ve been playing the first few Bach suites this way for years, using Johnston&apos;s notation to keep track of the shifts, but I had considered it more of an experiment than a historically authentic approach. &nbsp;But evidently this was a real possibility in Bach&apos;s day, although I doubt that one of these virtuosi ever played his works. These players would even&nbsp;do things such as flattening the E and/or A strings by a comma, and Barbieri gives very precise diagrams for placing the fingers for the 10/9 or 9/8 seconds.&nbsp;<br/>When playing with harpsichords, these players would use the same approach, hanging the fairly pure M or m 3rds on to whatever roots were given by the keyboard; players would &nbsp; tune their strings to the 5ths of the keyboard.<br/>Barbieri believes a flip back to Pythagorean tuning (with the two 9/8&apos;s stacked above the dominant tone, resulting in a higher leading tone) was in the works in the latter part of the 18th century, which would explain why some manuals &nbsp;from ca. the 1790s show a C# above a Db. &nbsp; However, many manuals from the early years of the 19th century still distinguish the two tones, often with different fingerings given for &quot;enharmonically equivalent&quot; tones. &nbsp;By mid-century, most of the manuals I&apos;ve seen no longer distinguish the tones. &nbsp;However, both the syntonic/meantone and &quot;Pythagorean&quot; (which I believe was less a precisely measured tuning approach than a matter of pushing sharps up and flats down) approaches were still alive, as evidenced by Joachim&apos;s testimony and recordings (for the former) and early recording stars such as Casals (for the latter).<br/>There have been studies of violin intonation; an influential one claiming that violinists played with Pythagorean tuning was published in the 1940&apos;s, I believe. &nbsp;Most of the evidence I&apos;ve seen shows a wide variety of tuning approaches early in the century, becoming more and more standardized (rough ET) toward the 1960&apos;s. &nbsp;Luckily, around that time historically informed performance practice started to really take off and saved us from uncritical acceptance of a single standard. &nbsp;<br/>I have nothing against ET for modern music; I compose primarily post-tonal music involving ET microtones (24 edo, etc.), which requires learning ET intervals precisely. &nbsp;The tuning often sounds lovely, and has allowed orchestral players from different families to match up to an astonishing degree. My primary arguments with ET are primarily with it&apos;s being used for traditional (i.e., pre-20th century) music. First, no matter how wonderful it is to hear all members of an orchestra playing &nbsp;&quot;in tune,&quot; the tuning system used to enable and enforce this has probably ended up sapping much (not all, of course) of the expressive substance out of the music. Every chord sounds fine now, whereas I don&apos;t think that all chords and keys in a tonal piece should be treated as equal. For example, one of the prime imperatives for a string player now is to play every A# and Bb with identical intonation; if you can&apos;t achieve this, you probably won&apos;t win any auditions.<br/> &nbsp;For a fine Italian violinist of the Baroque period, this indifference to these distinctions would have marked the player as one of those &quot;lousy tavern fiddlers playing in equal temperament&quot; (i.e., unable to make the distinctions the elegant players knew how to produce; this is a rough quote from a discussion of tuning at the Royal Society in London in the late 17th century). Now the intonation of the &quot;lousy tavern fiddlers&quot; is being enforced as the norm. &nbsp;<br/>Second, one of the primary means of achieving this lovely tonal blend has been the spread of vibrato to most instruments of the orchestra. &nbsp;This creates a chorus effect that blurs the pitch and makes everything sound lovely and sort of in tune. &nbsp;Again, I think this saps a lot of expressive weight out of the music, imposing a patina of cheesy beauty over every type of expression in every type of music. For some music, it is lovely, but I object to this vibrato being applied all the time. This is why for traditional music I often prefer older recordings by groups such as the Busch Quartet or artists such as Casals to more modern interpretations.&nbsp;<br/>However, one has to survive as a professional, so I usually use the standard vibrato now when performing with other musicians; other musicians and the audience prefer it. &nbsp;I haven&apos;t met many players willing to do without it an tune very precisely. &nbsp;The Kepler Quartet is very unusual this way, and I admire their recording of Johnston&apos;s quartets tremendously.

First, no matter how<br/>wonderful it is to hear all members of an orchestra playing  &quot;in tune,&quot;<br/>the tuning system used to enable and enforce this has probably ended up<br/>sapping much (not all, of course) of the expressive substance out of the music. Every chord sounds fine now, whereas I don&apos;t think that all<br/>chords and keys in a tonal piece should be treated as equal.&quot;<br/>    I would consider that a very strong argument against playing original works in &quot;new&quot; scales.  In other words, the fact when the intentional &quot;disproportionately sour and sweet&quot; parts in the originals are eliminated the piece of music in question loses a lot of it&apos;s genuine nature in using such &quot;undesirable artifacts&quot; the build and wind down tension.  I figure in new songs in TET tunings and other &quot;averaged feel&quot; tunings, the composer can find other ways to build tension than, say, using wolf notes or other ways to build consonance than things like virtually perfect intervals...but in old songs it&apos;s doing a dis-service to how the original composer used &quot;weird artifacts&quot; of the scale to his/her advantage.</p><p>&gt;&quot;This creates a chorus effect that blurs the pitch and makes everything<br/>sound lovely and sort of in tune.  &quot;<br/>  Putting vibrato over sounds indeed has this advantage.   Come to think of it...&quot;even&quot; if you make a straight harmonic series scale I&apos;ve heard slightly de-tuning some partials actually makes things sound less tense and more &quot;rainbow-ish&quot;.  Such partial &quot;wavering&quot; is, of course, a huge part of programming realistic string sounds and does give more slack far as giving a feeling of &quot;perfect pitch&quot; even if the pitches are not dead-on.<br/>  It can get a bit muddy and out-of-tune if the strings have to much de-tuning to the point you can&apos;t tell where the root tone is easily and it seems to, say, bounce between a 6/5 and a 13/8...but a bit of controlled partial de-tuning like that in many stringed instruments appears to unlock all sorts of flexibility.</p></div><h3><a id=88538 href="#88538">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2010 2:46:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A bit late (sore throat and fever means not so much behind computer)<br/>but here are the examples of childrens and holliday songs in major in<br/>JI.</p><p>In JI in classic major scale.
