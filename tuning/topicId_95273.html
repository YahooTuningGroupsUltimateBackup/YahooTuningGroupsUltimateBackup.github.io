For example, putting 176/175 with 3136/3125, we either get a rank three temperament or a (very closely related) no-threes temperament. For some optimized tunings the tuning will be the same for the no-threes part. In this example, the generator is ~28/25 and 31 or 37 can be used as tunings; it could be called the no-threes 31&amp;37 tuning, but another way to describe it is as the no-threes reduction of hemiwuerschmidt. 37edo is an excellent tuning both for the 11-limit and the extension of this temperament to the 13 limit, and MOS of size 7, 13, 19, 25, 31 and 37 are available.

Guess I&apos;m getting better with the math here.<br/>So this is a rank-2, 13 limit temperament that eliminates the<br/>following commas:</p><p>50/49<br/>121/120<br/>144/143<br/>169/168</p><p>This yields an apparently unnamed &quot;8 &amp; 16&quot; temperament in Graham&apos;s<br/>temperament finder. This temperament has a period of 1/8 of octave,<br/>and has an MOS at 16 notes. The generator is 50 cents (or 100 cents if<br/>you want 3/2) and the period is 150 cents.</p><p>So you end up with the following symmetrical scale, which is something<br/>that I had stumbled upon about a long time ago but never thought to<br/>analyze via regular mapping:</p><p>2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 out of 24</p><p>This is, in a sense, diminished[8] (superdiminished[16]?) smushed into<br/>half the space. It is extremely rich in 13-limit harmony, and is an<br/>intuitive higher-limit extension of the diminished[8] octatonic scale.<br/>Just like diminished[8] has 4:5:6 and 10:12:15 chords over the same<br/>root, this scale has 8:10:11:12:13 and 10:11:12:13:15 chords over the<br/>same root. So this works really well as a 2.3.5.11.13 subgroup<br/>temperament. It doesn&apos;t fare as well with 7, but if you want to map<br/>7/5 to 600 cents and 7/4 to 1000 cents then you can. Keep in mind that<br/>with 24-equal, the 17&apos;s and 19&apos;s are near-just and you have yourself a<br/>2.3.5.11.13.17.19 subgroup temperament, although you&apos;d probably have<br/>to be really clever to get the 17 and 19 to &quot;ring out&quot; so to speak.</p><p>This 16-note MOS might work really well if treated like we treat<br/>miracle[21], in the sense that it&apos;s a &quot;chromatic&quot; scale with 8-equal<br/>function as the &quot;base&quot; MOS to build melodies around and/or alter. I<br/>think there will be lots of really useful subscales that come out of<br/>this scale as well.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/2010 4:57:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; One problem with subgroup temperaments is that there are<br/>&gt; so many of them.

This temperament has a period of 1/8 of octave,<br/>&gt; and has an MOS at 16 notes.

It looks as if you could arrive at something much more accurate by deep sixing the 50/49, but that won&apos;t work, as another basis for the commas is 36/35, 50/49, 66/65, 143/140.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2010 7:23:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/subgroup/">http://lumma.org/music/theory/subgroup/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; where results and code can be downloaded in plain text or<br/>&gt; &gt; Excel format.
