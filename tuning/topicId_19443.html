Seems there&apos;s a LOT<br/>of that going on on the list!  ;-&gt;</p><p>&gt;I feel that what needs mentioning is that this information resource<br/>&gt;would have to be sequentialized, and stratified, and use in depth<br/>&gt;articulate, and intricate descriptions.</p><p>Your suggestion for a hierarchical organization for FAQ&apos;s, though of<br/>clear utility if feasible, might be difficult to achieve effectively,<br/>I believe.</p><p>&gt;I mean, its all very well having a zillion cross links,  and<br/>&gt;definitions within definitions, but this often produces a maze of<br/>&gt;information which is very exhausting to read, and its easy to get lost.</p><p>I understand how you feel, but at least there&apos;s a &quot;home&quot;, i.e., the<br/>top of the FAQ list itself.  The zillion cross links, overwhelming as<br/>they may sometimes seem to be, accurately reflect how things relate to<br/>each other in myriad ways.  I am still a huge fan of the printed word; I<br/>love the feel of a book, the smell of a book, etc., etc., but the<br/>advantages of hyper-links are gigantic, IMHO, in spite of the frightenly<br/>infinite feel of them.</p><p>&gt;Working examples, and pop tests would be an advantage.</p><p>Yes, though having lots of volunteers would certainly help achieve this!<br/>Will you consider writing &quot;tests&quot; for things you&apos;ve struggled to learn?</p><p>&gt;Start simple, and build up.</p><p>Agreed; the first questions on the list should be the most simple,<br/>providing, if possible, a foundation for the ones to follow.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
