The 53-tone scale is, for all<br/>intents and purposes, identical to a chain of pure fifths, and has<br/>essentially pure thirds and sixths as well. So if one has a very good ear,<br/>one can begin to teach oneself the 53-tone system just by tuning the violin<br/>in pure fifths and making pure major and minor thirds and  major and minor<br/>sixths with the open strings, then finding pure intervals from the resulting<br/>notes, and so on. The comma, which is essentially 1 step out of the 53, can<br/>be found as follows: Tune your violin in pure fifths G-d-a-e&apos;. Play the e on<br/>the d string which is exactly one octave below the e&apos; string (try making the<br/>chord e-a-e&apos; as consonant as possible). Now continue playing just the low e<br/>and add the open G string. To make this major sixth G-e as consonant as<br/>possible, you will have to slide the e down by one comma. This is the<br/>smallest unit of tuning in the Turkish system, and 53 of them make up one<br/>octave (I&apos;m ignoring the tiny difference between the syntonic and<br/>Pythagorean commas here). However, many Turkish maqamat will be difficult to<br/>construct directly from consonant intervals (in fact the whole 53-tone<br/>theory is kind of artifical since Turkish music is melodic and not<br/>harmonic), plus the expressive deviations are just as important, so there is<br/>no substitute for a deep familarity with hearing the music and experience<br/>playing along with it.</p></div><h3><a id=11511 href="#11511">ðŸ”—</a>moti &#x3C;motoco@netvision.net.il&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2000 7:16:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;[aside: this is pretty close to a 12-tET mode like C C# Eb E G Ab Bb C,<br/>&gt;which, when I constructed an exercise to practice 18 modes in 12-tET, was<br/>&gt;the only one of them without an accepted name.
