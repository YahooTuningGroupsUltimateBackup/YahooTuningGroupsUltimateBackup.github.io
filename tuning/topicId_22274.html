I gather that doesn&apos;t happen on high end<br/>devices, and I wonder if there are any that take account of<br/>the patch number when deciding which to switch off, but if<br/>there are, naturally one can&apos;t tailor ones midi to them.</p><p>Best solution I&apos;ve found so far is, if both have same note number,<br/>then play them in different channels, even if of the<br/>same pitch. That is what FTS does. I&apos;ll be very<br/>interested if there is any way of doing it in a single<br/>track</p><p>However, even with this, it is a very useful thing, and makes<br/>many things possible that would be quite impossible in MIDI<br/>otherwise.</p><p>It isn&apos;t part of the Midi standard at all. The standard would only<br/>allow one voice patch at a time in a channel.</p><p>However modern implementations of Midi usually use the idea of a<br/>track, and the devices are referred to as &quot;multi-timbral&quot;.</p><p>From help for FTS:<br/>&quot;<br/>However I&apos;ve checked up on this, and in practice, modern devices<br/>and sound cards use a concept of a track independent from channels.<br/>Lower end of the range devices have 16 tracks . Then you can play<br/>up to this number of voices in any channel (possibly less as it<br/>may implement some voices using two simultaneous tracks - for<br/>instance, for the honky tonk piano). If the total number of voices<br/>in play exceeds the number of tracks, it uses some kind of<br/>algorithm to decide which to leave out, as being the &quot;least<br/>important&quot; one sounding at the time.</p><p>See for instance, Phil Rees&apos;s article MIDI channels, voices, timbres and<br/>Modes (look under Multi-Mode)<br/>&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.philrees.co.uk/articles/midimode.htm">http://www.philrees.co.uk/articles/midimode.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
