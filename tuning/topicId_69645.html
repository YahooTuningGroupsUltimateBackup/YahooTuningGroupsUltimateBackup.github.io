The simple ratios theory is wrong, I didn&apos;t speak<br/>so in my book, I was very polite. The simple ratio theory is the result<br/>of a huge confusion between :<br/>* ratios with small numbers : 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/5, 7/3, 7/4,<br/>7/5, 8/3, 7/6<br/>* and harmonics (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7Â….) brought into the span of an octave<br/>by dividing several times by 2 :  2/1 (octave), 3/2 (dominant or<br/>fifth), 5/4 (natural third), 7/4 (harmonic seventh), 9/8 (tone or major<br/>second), 11/4 or 11/8 (middle of F and F*).<br/>Some of these both series are identical, others are not used in Music<br/>Theory, the only one which has paused a real problem for 15 centuries<br/>is the fourth 4/3.

All simple ratios have been used in music<br/>theory, and in musical practice, come to that. The fourth has<br/>sometimes, in some times and places and in cultural contexts where<br/>there is a well-defined notion of consonace, to be a consonant interval<br/>and sometimes not.</p><p>&gt;Ithas been considered as consonant by several<br/>&gt; ancient theorists, I have called this the &quot;fourth paradox&quot;.</p><p>It&apos;s been considered to be a consonace by many theorists since then<br/>also.</p></div>
