His writings are presently unpublished.  Several chapters are rather complete, each on a different figure in pre-Socratic philsophy, using the tools of musical intelligence to understand their meanings.</p><p>Pythagorus may have met Anaximander and would have known of the &quot;Ionian Enchantment&quot; (phrase for first chapter of &quot;Consilience&quot; by Wilson, relating to the mix of fields in a Unity of Knowledge).  At this dawning of Western philosophy, musical intelligence was at its zenith.  While Pythagoras was very musically connected in the following centuries, almost a Christ-like figure before there was Christ, there is more myth than Pyth.</p><p>Other than asking Siem for a copy of his work, the world must wait until he is finished with his undertaking.
