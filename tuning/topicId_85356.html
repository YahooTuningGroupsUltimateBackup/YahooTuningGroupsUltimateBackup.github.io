Also the tempo was increased by two. One of the interesting aspects of this piece is that the voice leading is starting to work and I stumbled upon a real progression with resolution that occurs about 1:42. When playing this configuration the main challenge was remembering the relationships of 17 ET mapped to a 12 ET keyboard Â– for instance a minor 7th becomes a 5th. Many of the chord changes are abrupt since I was moving a pattern of notes in a parallel motion up and down the keyboard as a main generator of the piece. The piece has some decidedly xenharmonic passages. The compositional choices lean towards a balance of consonance and dissonance analogous to 12 ET common practice.</p><p>The MP3 is here :  <a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/daily20091203-piano-17et.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/daily20091203-piano-17et.mp3</a></p><p>The OGG is here : <a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/daily20091203-piano-17et.ogg">http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/daily20091203-piano-17et.ogg</a></p><p>The score (at 8th note resolution) is here : <a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/daily20091203-piano-study-17et.pdf">http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/daily20091203-piano-study-17et.pdf</a></p><p>As a request - it would be great to have a tool that could take a piece like this in standard midi notation and translate to the tuning actually used in some xenharmonic notation with the input of the scala file.
