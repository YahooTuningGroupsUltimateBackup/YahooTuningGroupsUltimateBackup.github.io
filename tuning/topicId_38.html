<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Janko and Vandervoort</h1><h3><a id=38 href="#38">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1998 8:56:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I believe I mentioned Paul Vandervoort on this list a _long_ time<br/>&gt;ago--possibly within the first year or so of its existence.  Vandervoort<br/>&gt;has made some refinements to the Janko keyboard, one of which is a<br/>&gt;parallelogram linkage to equalize the leverage.  I have a citation<br/>&gt;somewhere of an article from the &apos;70s about his ideas, but I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;found anything since then (though I haven&apos;t looked real recently), so I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t know if he&apos;s still active.</p><p>This was the break I&apos;ve been looking for.  I found a bunch of stuff on the<br/>IBM Patent Server.  Your cite may still be helpful, do you have it?  Also,<br/>where would you check if you wanted to &quot;look recently&quot;?</p><p>Carl</p></div>
