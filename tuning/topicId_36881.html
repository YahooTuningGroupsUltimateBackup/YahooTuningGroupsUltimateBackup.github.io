If you want to do it in real<br/>time in software, you&apos;ll need to budget for multiple processors, which<br/>will probably work out cheaper, but more than the $200 extra for a<br/>different soundcard.  You&apos;ll need at least double the processor power and<br/>double the RAM if you double the sampling rate.  The cost and<br/>specifications of the Kyma hardware haven&apos;t changed for a couple of years,<br/>so they are behind PCs.  But I don&apos;t know of any other system that can do<br/>what Kyma does.  You could probably do it in CSound but not in real time.</p><p>You said above you don&apos;t know what &quot;PCM&quot; means, so how do you know you<br/>need 196 kHz of it?  I can&apos;t hear any improvement over 64 kHz even with<br/>distortion, where subharmonics might be important.  Until you definitely<br/>know you need these astronomical bitrates, assume you&apos;ll be processing in<br/>48kHz and interpolating if you need to deliver in 96kHz equivalent.  You<br/>won&apos;t be able to hear the difference.  To be able to recognize enough<br/>partials to do spectral processing that does 48kHz justice, you already<br/>need a huge amount of processor power.</p><p>Your requirements before were</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>3)Is there a software that allows you to apply the the<br/>pitch dynamic (in any format) of a prerecorded sound<br/>to a sustained pitch prerecorded sound? Can you draw<br/>the graph yourself?</p><p>4)Is there a software that allowas you to apply the<br/>volume dynamic (in any format) of a prerecorded to a<br/>constant volume prerecorded sound? Can you draw the<br/>graph yourself?<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>You can do this reasonably well in a base Kyma system at 44 or 48 kHz.<br/>I&apos;m not sure how you do the graphs, but it must be possible.  If the files<br/>already have a constant pitch, and the pitch dynamic you want to apply has<br/>already been calculated, you might be able to do the pitch shifting in<br/>real time at 96kHz on a base system.  But if real time isn&apos;t a problem<br/>neither is the sample rate.  You can label the 196 kHz files as 32kHz and<br/>run them through Kyma.  Then label the output as 196 kHz.</p><p>A 196 kHz soundcard might be useful if you&apos;re recording acoustic sources<br/>and you want them in 96kHz quality.  You can record them at 196 kHz, apply<br/>a digital filter and downsample.  But I&apos;ve never seen any evidence that<br/>you get audibly better results than recording at 96kHz with an analog<br/>filter.  You&apos;ll probably need specialist microphones as well.  If you&apos;re<br/>expected to preserve that level of quality, you should expect to spend a<br/>huge amount of money, so don&apos;t worry about the $3000 for Kyma.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=36896 href="#36896">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2002 11:17:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jose,</p><p> &gt;There are actually soundboards and equipment that<br/> &gt;samples in 196MHz from 16 to 32 bits (I do not<br/> &gt;understand the term PCM but I guess that also applies<br/> &gt;to this equipment)</p><p>PCM stands for Pulse Code Modulation.
