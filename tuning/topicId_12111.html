If so... who on<br/>&gt;this list has had experience with non-12-tempered ET&apos;s within the<br/>&gt;realm of transposition and modulation??</p><p>    My piece Limp Off to School modulates several times using what<br/>one could call, I suppose, &quot;deceptive diatonic cadences&quot;. 19tet has<br/>a large and small minor third, and you can use their &quot;interchangeably&quot;<br/>to modulate to uniquely 19tet key centers through what sounds like<br/>an ordinary diatonic cadence. LOtS uses the 1-6-5-1 cadence a lot,<br/>but the 6 is the small minor third down from the 1, so you end up a<br/>small half step sharp of the original key afterward. Also, the section<br/>whose words begin &quot;no gym class...&quot; moves up two frets, down<br/>three frets, up two frets, but this sounds almost like movement up<br/>and down a whole step.<br/>    Citified Notions has sections that sound like motion up and down<br/>a fourth, but they are really up and down a large major third. Yeah,<br/>I am intentionally using these &quot;deceptive&quot; cadences knowing their effect<br/>is in part based on 12tet expectations, but that&apos;s part of the fun, and<br/>they really do have their own logic and beauty, aside from their<br/>&quot;deceptive diatonicity&quot;.<br/>    There.
