However, I&apos;m also working in the just intonation subgroup generated by 2, 3, 11/7 and 13/7, and I want to temper those ratios specifically. If for some integer N I round off to the nearest integer the quantities N*log2(3), N*log2(11/7) and N*log2(13/7) I get a mapping, and if I require 351/350 and 364/363 to be tempered out, I get a finite number of possible mappings. Choosing the best one by the &quot;Tenney-Euclidean&quot; error measure picks out 271 as the optimal choice. It may not make much difference, but it gives me a quick way of finding a good equal temperament tuning. I like those because they are in some circumstances convenient--say, for instance, I wanted to reconstruct an exact specification for the scale, or I want to find related temperaments, or I am working on a score in this temperament, etc.</p></div><h3><a id=96601 href="#96601">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2011 4:20:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, having just looked at the wiki you have loads of great information up<br/>there.

I&apos;m trying to understand your it. If these questions get to be too much, please don&apos;t feel pressured to answer them.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt;&gt; What is 271 ET tempering, and why choose that temperament instead of<br/>&gt;&gt; the almost-equivalent-sounding 272 ET, say? Or the more precise 542<br/>&gt;&gt; ET?</p><p>Gene:<br/>&gt; First off, I want to temper out the commas 351/350 and 364/383, and<br/>&gt; 271 does this.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>As I understand it, when people temper commas, it&apos;s to eliminate the difference between two notes. For instance, tempering 81/80 removes the difference between a major and a minor whole tone; similarly, it removes the difference between (4 perfect 5ths) and (2 octaves + 1 Major 3rd).</p><p>Why do you want to temper out 351/350 or 364/383? What groups of intervals are you making equivalent, and why (if there&apos;s a reason)?</p><p>&gt; But it&apos;s not the only choice; I could have used, say, 208 instead.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how you know this, but I understand how it&apos;s possible and I&apos;m willing to push the &quot;I believe&quot; button on this point. :)</p><p>&gt; However, I&apos;m also working in the just intonation subgroup generated by<br/>&gt; 2, 3, 11/7 and 13/7, and I want to temper those ratios specifically.</p><p>If I understand this correctly, it means you&apos;re trying to work with a group of intervals that can be reached by arbitrary multiplication and division of these four numbers.</p><p>It seems to me that by using 11/7 and 13/7, you are enforcing the fact that you will always have two larger primes if you have any at all (i.e., if you have 7 you have 13 or 11; if you have 13 you have 7 or 11; if you have 11 you have 7 or 13). I&apos;m not sure why that&apos;s useful or harmonically / melodically interesting, but you wouldn&apos;t have that constraint if you had 2, 3, 7, 11, 13 as your generators. Is that your goal, or just an artifact of some other goal? If an artifact, I suspect it&apos;s related to the mapping (below): Am I right? If a goal, why have that goal?</p><p>Although, given that you aren&apos;t using all possible intervals generated by the generators, why do you need to specifically force this limitation? In other words, it seems that you could have other intervals in here that you haven&apos;t included; for instance, between the 13/11 and the 14/11, you could have 33/26, but you don&apos;t. Is this interval eliminated by some other constraint? And if you don&apos;t have to have a constraint that prevents 33/26, why have a constraint that prevents, say, 7/6? Why not just arbitrarily select intervals?</p><p>&gt; If for some integer N I round off to the nearest integer the quantities<br/>&gt; N*log2(3), N*log2(11/7) and N*log2(13/7) I get a mapping,</p><p>This makes sense to me, I think; you&apos;re rounding off to the nearest integer to determine the corresponding step number in the ET you&apos;re using, yes?</p><p>&gt; and if I require 351/350 and 364/363 to be tempered out, I get a finite number of<br/>&gt; possible mappings.</p><p>...because not all ETs temper those commas. That makes sense, except I still don&apos;t know why you don&apos;t want to temper 351/350 and 364/363.</p><p>&gt; Choosing the best one by the &quot;Tenney-Euclidean&quot; error measure picks out 271 as<br/>&gt; the optimal choice.</p><p>I had to look this up, and it involves a lot of math I don&apos;t understand yet. But it sounds like you&apos;re using some formula to determine which of the &quot;finite number of possible mappings&quot; has the smallest error for some given level of complexity. And, to answer my own question, you could have gone with 542 ET, but that would have added to the complexity without signficantly reducing the error. (I think.)</p><p>&gt; It may not make much difference, but it gives me a quick way of finding a good<br/>&gt; equal temperament tuning. I like those because they are in some circumstances<br/>&gt; convenient--say, for instance, I wanted to reconstruct an exact specification<br/>&gt; for the scale, or I want to find related temperaments, or I am working on a<br/>&gt; score in this temperament, etc.</p><p>Okay. My actual ability to make microtonal music is pretty limited at the moment, so I&apos;ll take this on faith as well.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=96603 href="#96603">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2011 9:42:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By the way, it&apos;s a really cool scale.

The rest of the notes are just spread out enough over the octave to make them useful.

Maybe more on that in another post.</p><p>Thanks very much again for your patience and explanations.

There are various possibilities for tempering it,<br/>&gt; such as putting it all in 31 equal.</p><p>I guess I have to decide what I want out of it before I do that, though. I ultimately figured out that I think I need to reduce the prime limit and possibly temper it in 41 equal, which provides very close approximations to this scale -- though I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s the &quot;mathematically correct&quot; thing to do.</p><p>Fair warning: I&apos;m writing the rest of this because writing it all down helps me figure things out. Maybe someone will find it interesting, but nobody needs to pay attention; I won&apos;t get offended. :) I&apos;ve actually started writing this three times with different approaches, and each time I&apos;ve realized that my approach had a problem -- but I didn&apos;t notice the new problem until I started writing down the &quot;solution&quot;.</p><p>This septimal scale is one of the first scales I put together to play around with, and I wasn&apos;t paying attention to primes, only ratios. So it has 8/7, 9/7, 10/7, 11/7, 12/7, and 13/7 in it.  But my real intent was to get the 0-267-498 and 0-267-702 chords (6:7:8 and 6:7:9) that I like so much. I also want the harmonic 7, which sounds beautiful over those triads (12:14:16:21 and 12:14:18:21). So the base of the scale is 0-267-498-702-969-1200 cents. The rest is filling in the gaps in a quasi-diatonic way, and filling in more gaps in a quasi-chromatic way (apropos of the &quot;chromatic pairs&quot; discussion going on in another thread).</p><p>Now that I&apos;m considering prime limits, I&apos;m approaching this in a different way.</p><p>The original scale is heinously complicated (10 step sizes ranging from 49/48 (36 cents) to 54/49 (168 cents), which -- I think -- is at the root of it sounding &quot;sloppy&quot; in the little song I made with it. Based on what Igs told me about &quot;tuning spaces&quot;, that&apos;s in part because it&apos;s a selection from subgroup 2,3,5,7,11,13; too many primes lining up in too many ways will make for too many incommensurable ratios. So now I&apos;m thinking that if I&apos;m looking for good septimal minor seconds, fourths, fifths, and harmonic 7ths, I should eliminate the 11 and 13 and focus on 7-limit ratios that give me that instead.</p><p>That leads me to looking at the 4/3 step of the scale as a root of a chord. The 11/7 gave me a 284-cent minor third over the 4/3. If I change that to 14/9, I get a &quot;proper&quot; (i.e., one that was like other modes of the scale) 267-cent septimal minor third. Now I could play traditional i-iv-v chords if I wanted to.</p><p>Oh, except the 5th up from the 3/2 step (the V mode of the scale) is way out of whack: The 8/7 septimal whole tone drives that way up to 729 cents. I kinda like the 8/7, though, so I&apos;m not sure I want to get rid of it. Maybe I just won&apos;t rely on the fifth for the V chord.</p><p>Finally, eliminating the 13/7 still requires some kind of major-seventh-ish tone. Options include 50/27 (1067 cents), 28/15 (1081 cents), or 15/8 (1088 cents). Since I&apos;m trying to use septimal tones, 28/15 seems like a better option here than the others.</p><p>So this looks like what I&apos;m dealing with now.</p><p> 15/14            119.443  major diatonic semitone<br/>  8/7             231.174  septimal whole tone<br/>  7/6             266.871  septimal minor third<br/>  9/7             435.084  septimal major third, BP third<br/>  4/3             498.045  perfect fourth<br/> 10/7             617.488  Euler&apos;s tritone<br/>  3/2             701.955  perfect fifth<br/> 14/9             764.916<br/> 12/7             933.129  septimal major sixth<br/>  7/4             968.826  harmonic seventh<br/> 28/15           1080.557<br/>  2/1            1200.000  octave</p><p>Things are still a little strange. There are these little 49/48 steps (36 cents) between the 8/7 &amp; 7/6 and the 12/7 &amp; 7/4, but that&apos;s the price you pay for having both the 8/7 and the 7/6.</p><p>Here&apos;s something new I learned: If you tell Scala Analyze / Show Interval Differences, you get lists of commas and their prime factors. So, for Canton (before tempering), you get:<br/> 10648/10647,     0.1626 cents    11.11.11/3.3.7.13.13<br/>   364/363,       4.7627 cents    7.13/3.11.11<br/>   352/351,       4.9253 cents    11/3.3.3.13<br/>  1701/1664,      38.0732 cents   3.3.3.3.3.7/13<br/>  3969/3872,      42.8359 cents   3.3.3.3.7.7/11.11<br/>   693/676,       42.9985 cents   <a href="http://3.3.7.11/13.13">3.3.7.11/13.13</a><br/>   147/143,       47.7612 cents   3.7.7/11.13</p><p>(Unfortunately, there&apos;s a bug or something that&apos;s preventing prime 2 from showing up.)</p><p>The 364/363, 352/351, and 147/143 are all commas that Gene told me about in his discussion of tempering Canton. He also noted that there were approximations in the scale that were 364/363 or 352/351, as well as others that were off by the product of those two commas.</p><p>So I tried the same thing with this new septimal scale I got:</p><p>225/224,      7.7115 cents   <a href="http://3.3.5.5/2.2.2.2.7">3.3.5.5/2.2.2.2.7</a><br/> 81/80,      21.5063 cents   <a href="http://3.3.3.3/2.2.2.2.5">3.3.3.3/2.2.2.2.5</a><br/> 64/63,      27.2641 cents   2.2.2.2.2.2/3.3.7<br/> 50/49,      34.9756 cents   2.5.5/7.7<br/> 36/35,      48.7704 cents   <a href="http://2.2.3.3/5.7">2.2.3.3/5.7</a><br/>405/392,     56.4819 cents   3.3.3.3.5/2.2.2.7.7</p><p>(I added in the 2s that Scala left out.)</p><p>I started playing around with factorizations of these, but quickly realized why that wouldn&apos;t help.</p><p>So it looks like I could temper 225/224.

One of those is in the V mode, which is nice: I can now get an almost perfectly just M3 if I want to do a i-iv-V progression.</p><p>My number of one-step intervals sizes is, unsurprisingly, now 5 instead of 6.</p><p>I played with a variety of other commas, too, without knowing whether they were relevant, and didn&apos;t see much that was interesting. I did notice that when I tempered out 32805/32768, 1029/1024, and 225/224, I got a mode of 41 equal that&apos;s less than 5 cents off of all of my notes. Since I&apos;m limiting myself to 12 notes because that&apos;s a limitation of my music-making abilities, I don&apos;t know that I&apos;ll take advantage of other aspects of 41 equal, but at least for those 12 notes I&apos;m getting what I want.</p><p>I&apos;ve talked too much and done too little, so I&apos;m leaving it there for right now. :)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=97199 href="#97199">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2011 9:25:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jake Freivald &lt;jdfreivald@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So this looks like what I&apos;m dealing with now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   15/14            119.443  major diatonic semitone<br/>&gt;    8/7             231.174  septimal whole tone<br/>&gt;    7/6             266.871  septimal minor third<br/>&gt;    9/7             435.084  septimal major third, BP third<br/>&gt;    4/3             498.045  perfect fourth<br/>&gt;   10/7             617.488  Euler&apos;s tritone<br/>&gt;    3/2             701.955  perfect fifth<br/>&gt;   14/9             764.916<br/>&gt;   12/7             933.129  septimal major sixth<br/>&gt;    7/4             968.826  harmonic seventh<br/>&gt;   28/15           1080.557<br/>&gt;    2/1            1200.000  octave</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s something new I learned: If you tell Scala Analyze / Show<br/>&gt; Interval Differences, you get lists of commas and their prime factors.<br/>&gt; So, for Canton (before tempering), you get:<br/>&gt;   10648/10647,     0.1626 cents    11.11.11/3.3.7.13.13<br/>&gt;     364/363,       4.7627 cents    7.13/3.11.11<br/>&gt;     352/351,       4.9253 cents    11/3.3.3.13</p><p>Etc.

Marvel has &quot;less complexity for 5/4&quot; (which I understand as a measure, but not intuitively yet), and that the tuning gives (5/4)*(5/4)*(9/7) = 2/1 vs. (5/4)^3 = 2/1 like in 12tET. That&apos;s interesting, because stacked major thirds tend to annoy me in 12tET. Although there&apos;s no opportunity to play with that in this scale (no stacked major thirds), I&apos;ll have to see if I like the augmented triad more in marvel than in 12tET. But with this scale, at the moment I&apos;m just tempering stuff to see what pops out, e.g., the smoothing out of major thirds among the modes of this scale.</p><p>This is part of the reason that I keep posting stuff that seems so stupid: I just can&apos;t seem to be able to figure out, from the xenharmonic wiki or other reading that I&apos;ve done, why I would temper some commas rather than others. When you showed me that cantonpenta took the canton 13/11 and 14/11 and made them add up to a 3/2, that gave me a functional reason for the temperament. When I tempered 225/224 from this septimal scale, I see the smoothing of the major thirds. But I don&apos;t have any a priori sense of what tonal quality tempering a given comma should impart, or what functional difference they&apos;d make to a scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When I do that, I get this Wedgie: &lt;&lt;1 2 -2 -5|| -- I only sort<br/>&gt; &gt; of know what that is conceptually<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing it is is a unique way of labeling a temperament, but for<br/>&gt; a corank one, ie single comma, temperament, all the same<br/>&gt; information is in the comma itself; this is the monzo written<br/>&gt; backwards with sign changes, which doesn&apos;t help much.</p><p>I think I understand that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I got a mode of 41 equal that&apos;s less than 5 cents off of all of<br/>&gt; &gt; my notes.
