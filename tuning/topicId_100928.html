In the 7-limit, you have the otonal 4:5:6:7 and utonal 1/4:1/5:1/6:1/7, and eight triads obtained by omitting one of the notes of either of these; these are your basic 7-limit chords, but no system seems involved in naming them. Similarly, you can omit one or two notes from 4:5:6:7:9 or 1/4:1/5:1/6:1/7:1/9, and would this be a good starting point, leaving off the masses of asses at first.</p><p>By the way, what does &quot;NM&quot; mean on the Scala list anyway?</p></div>
