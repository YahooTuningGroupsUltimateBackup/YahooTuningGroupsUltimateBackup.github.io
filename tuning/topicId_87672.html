Incidentally, at the school where I study, the Cubase VST microtuner happens to be installed on one of the computers. But I&apos;m now getting stuck. First of all, does anyone here have an idea how I should load the xml file into it? And then, is there (somewhere) some kind of documentation on the format of this xml?</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
