The temperament was described at the very bottom of<br/>page 1 with the correct 11-limit minimax error, but I made a mistake<br/>in giving the value of the generator.

But the MOS concept wasn&apos;t explained very clearly<br/>there, and I don&apos;t think that I understood what Erv was referring to<br/>until John Chalmers later mentioned it in a letter.  By that time I<br/>was busy working on the development of the generalized-keyboard<br/>Scalatron and had put the Miracle temperament in the back of my mind.</p><p>When it came time to put a microtemperament of my own design on my<br/>instrument as a hard-wired tuning (labeled &quot;Secor&quot;), I didn&apos;t even<br/>consider the Miracle temperament, because I wasn&apos;t interested in<br/>anything with a harmonic limit lower than the 13 limit.</p><p>So the Miracle temperament and the moment-of-symmetry scale concept<br/>made their debut in print coincidentally in the same issue -- but it<br/>took another 26 years (and a new century) for anyone to combine the<br/>two ideas to produce the blackjack and canasta scales.
