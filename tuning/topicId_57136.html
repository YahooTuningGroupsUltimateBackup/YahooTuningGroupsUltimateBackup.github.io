I wouldn&apos;t be<br/>surprised if<br/>&gt; speakers do tend to introduce some distortion, but I don&apos;t really<br/>know.<br/>&gt;   In the piece I&apos;m preparing to publish now, I use a few pure<br/>sines, but<br/>&gt; also some additive ones.  It&apos;s very easy in Csound (and I&apos;m sure in<br/>&gt; other systems as well) to build a composite waveform with complete<br/>&gt; control over the choice of partials, and the relative strength and<br/>phase<br/>&gt; of each partial.  So in some cases I&apos;ll use a waveform that only<br/>uses<br/>&gt; multiples of the fundamental (e.g., partials 1, 2, 4, and 8) to get<br/>a<br/>&gt; more full sound  without muddying the tuning.</p><p>1) I think harmonic partials make the tuning more clear, rather than<br/>muddying it. In fact, as Aaron mentioned to me over the phone, almost<br/>any of the 12-note circulating tunings produce pretty much the same<br/>effect when sine-wave timbres are used, while rich harmonic timbres<br/>make the differences between the different tunings crystal clear. And<br/>in the case of JI tunings, harmonic partials are even more<br/>appropriate. The human auditory system is designed to extract the<br/>pitch of notes from the first few partials (often partials #3-6), and<br/>the stronger and more harmonic these partials are, the clearer and<br/>less muddy the perception of the tuning of the pitch.</p><p>2) As I wrote to Alison, you might want to try using only odd<br/>partials, if your intention is to get the same strong bands of<br/>constructive and destructive interference in the room (as a result of<br/>different relative distances from your head to each of the two<br/>speakers depending on where you are in the room) that you would get<br/>with sine waves.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2005 11:22:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;mopani@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Another interesting phenomenon is that pure (or as near as) sine<br/>waves sound<br/>&gt; strangely out of tune, especially in the low register and in<br/>combination<br/>&gt; with more complex timbres.</p><p>What do you mean by out of tune?

The<br/>  evangelical CSN International has over 200 applications filed with<br/>the<br/>FCC  for FM radio, not to mention their TV and AM holdings. Their<br/>would-be<br/>90.5  FM WSMA with 20,000 Watts would spread its signal across<br/>Boston,<br/>Quincy,  Hingham, Weymouth, Taunton and to the northwest. They plan<br/>to<br/>locate the  transmitter in Scituate, MA. Normally, non-commercial<br/>stations<br/>are required  to operate a human-staffed &quot;main studio&quot; in their city<br/>of<br/>license.  Non-commercial stations are supposed to have a local<br/>character<br/>with local  production about local affairs, and not be overrun by a<br/>chain&apos;s canned  programming. But in February CSN International moved<br/>to<br/>eliminate that  requirement for WSMA would-be 90.5 FM in Scituate.<br/>That<br/>is, CSN has asked  the FCC to waive the normal requirement for<br/>a &quot;main<br/>studio.&quot; They will  succeed, unless a concerted opposition is<br/>mounted. As<br/>you probably know, many evangelical Christian broadcast chains<br/>enjoyed a<br/>spree of buying small non-commercial radio stations across the<br/>country in<br/>recent years, often taking community and college frequencies that<br/>weren&apos;t<br/>organized to defend against it. This national issue is featured in<br/>the<br/>Feb.  25 &quot;Media Minutes&quot; update by Free Press.</p><p>Listeners affected include those to:</p><p>WZBC 90.3 FM, Newton MA<br/>Serving the surrounding community with 1,000 Watts live-DJ<br/>programming<br/>(Boston College).</p><p>WMFO 91.5 FM, Medford, MA<br/>Serving the surrounding community with 125 Watts live-DJ programming<br/>(Tufts  University).<br/><a href="http://www.democracies.com/">http://www.democracies.com/</a><br/>*********************************************************************</p><p>N.P.
