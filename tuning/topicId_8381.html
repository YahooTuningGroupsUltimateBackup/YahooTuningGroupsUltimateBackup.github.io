No money of mine is going to these guys until<br/>I&apos;ve seen a lot more.  I&apos;ve been over this ground a few times already -- as<br/>recently as &apos;96, with my professor at the conservatory of music at Indiana<br/>University.  As it&apos;s been presented to me in these previous encounters, I<br/>can only conclude that it&apos;s a lot of B.S.  Perhaps I&apos;ll state, at some<br/>point, how I&apos;ve come to this conclusion.</p><p>&gt;Secondly, terminolgy may be stinging us again -- the term &quot;dominant 7th&quot;<br/>is &gt;commonly used merely to distinguish the M3, m3, m3 chord from &quot;major<br/>7th&quot;, &gt;&quot;minor 7th&quot;, and other seventh chords.</p><p>Ouch.  Yes, indeed.  I usually use the term, &quot;maj/min 7th&quot; to speak of<br/>4:5:6:7 chords in 12-tet.  In this thread, I was using dominant chords to<br/>mean 1-3-5-7 chords.  It sounded like you were too, since the context was<br/>functional harmony, etc.</p><p>&gt;The term &quot;dominant&quot; is meaningless here, except to remind us where, in the<br/>&gt;diatonic scale, this chord normally appears.</p><p>The original statement was &quot;diatonic in function and origin&quot;.
