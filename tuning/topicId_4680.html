I checked the intonation at<br/>the octave, and found it to be reasonably close.  Then I counted the number<br/>of frets to the octave.  11 - WOW!  He is probably the proud owner of the<br/>worlds only 11 tone equal tempered Quattro!  He seemed confused by my<br/>congratulations.</p><p>This unique Quattro neck was probably the result of building two instruments<br/>of slightly different scale lengths, drinking too much, and mixing up the<br/>fretboards.  I wonder if there&apos;s a sibling 13tet Quattro lurking around<br/>somewhere?</p><p>THE IDEA:<br/>---------</p><p>On acoustic guitars or mandolins with moveable bridges (usually guitars with<br/>tailpieces and a wooden bridge):</p><p>* Slide the bridge toward the nut until the octave harmonic and the 11th<br/>fret play in tune with one another on the first string.</p><p>* Keeping that end of the bridge in place, adjust the 6th string side so<br/>that it&apos;s octave plays in tune with it&apos;s 11th fret.</p><p>Presto!  11tet.  You can tune the octave harmonic to any fret from about the<br/>9th, to the 15th without running into the soundhole or getting too close to<br/>the tailpiece.  Even on a regular acoustic guitar, you can make a surrogate<br/>bridge to sit in front of the real one.  Careful not to scratch the finish<br/>though!</p><p>It&apos;s free, requires no permanent modification to your instrument, and no<br/>tools other than your hands and ears.</p><p>Have fun experimenting!</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments">http://www.OrganicDesign.org/Glen/Instruments</a></p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/1999 10:50:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Glen Peterson, TD 305.12]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On acoustic guitars or mandolins with moveable bridges (usually<br/>&gt; guitars with tailpieces and a wooden bridge):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Slide the bridge toward the nut until the octave harmonic<br/>&gt; and the 11th fret play in tune with one another on the first<br/>&gt; string.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Keeping that end of the bridge in place, adjust the 6th string<br/>&gt; side so that it&apos;s octave plays in tune with it&apos;s 11th fret.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Presto!  11tet.
