I started out by uploading a few things I wrote<br/>years ago for the DX7II. It&apos;s all originally in 12-TET, but I couldn&apos;t<br/>resist changing a couple of them to use meantone tunings.</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/Herman_Miller/">http://www.mp3.com/Herman_Miller/</a></p><p>&quot;Kro&ccedil;nardsklestj&quot; is tuned to a version of the 1/7-comma meantone scale<br/>with 1/7-comma widened octaves with the black notes tuned as sharps --<br/>which produces an interesting result when the notes actually written in the<br/>score are flats.</p><p>&quot;Thers&eacute;nia&quot; is in the version of quarter-comma meantone that&apos;s built in to<br/>the DX7II. Again, the sharps and flats don&apos;t match exactly what&apos;s in the<br/>score, but it almost sounds like it was meant that way.</p></div>
