We currently have naming<br/>confusion surrounding those just like we did with semaphore. I think<br/>we should do again what we did with semaphore and try to organize<br/>things in a nice clean way.</p><p>These are things which should define their own familes just like<br/>meantone 2.3.5 81/80 does, or semaphore 2.3.7 49/48 does, and which<br/>ought to have extensions in extension groups of the subgroup just like<br/>any other good rank-2 temperament does.</p><p>As you know, these temperaments already have a plethora of possible<br/>names due to Keenan&apos;s naming scheme. 2.3.7 12&amp;17 is 2.3.7 superpyth,<br/>2.3.7 dominant, and so on. Likewise, 2.3.5 meantone is also 2.3.5<br/>dominant, 2.3.5 meanenneadecal, etc. However, 2.3.5 meantone also has<br/>one main name, which is &quot;meantone.&quot; Below I propose what the main name<br/>for each temperament should be to make everything as clear as<br/>possible.</p><p>=2.3.7 12&amp;17 64/63 - SUPERPYTH=<br/>Sometimes I think that this is the most conceptually important rank-2<br/>temperament after meantone, if not the most exotic. It&apos;s gone through<br/>a few different names. At one point I think &quot;septipyth&quot; was being<br/>floated around, and now it&apos;s called &quot;archy&quot; on the wiki. Almost<br/>everyone calls this &quot;superpyth,&quot; and it is indeed 2.3.7 superpyth.<br/>Much like how we swapped &quot;semiphore&quot; with &quot;semaphore,&quot; I think it<br/>would be nice to call this &quot;superpyth&quot; and leave the &quot;archy&quot; to the<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 64/63 rank-3 temperament. Then the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> temperament is just<br/>an extension of superpyth, which it is, and then superpyth and<br/>suprapyth are two 11-limit extensions, etc.</p><p>A wrinkle arises in this case that didn&apos;t with semaphore. In this<br/>case, Graham&apos;s temperament finder also calls this &quot;superpyth&quot;:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22_5&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22_5&limit=5</a></p><p>This name is not on the wiki, so I&apos;m not sure if there&apos;s a conflict or<br/>if it&apos;s supposed to be that way. However, note that this superpyth is<br/>indeed 2.3.5 superpyth using Keenan&apos;s naming scheme, so it&apos;s not a<br/>false name. However, note that 2.3.5 superpyth is not in the 2.3.7<br/>superpyth family, so it might be wise to call this something else.</p><p>One solution presents itself from that I note Erv Wilson and John<br/>Chalmers are both talking about it in Xenharmonikon 1 (!!), which<br/>means they might have precedence anyway. Maybe John Chalmers can weigh<br/>in on who first worked it out. This could be Chalmers or Wilson<br/>temperament. I dunno. Point is, 2.3.7 64/63 should definitely be<br/>superpyth too.</p><p>=2.3.11 7&amp;17 1029/1024 - MOHAJIRA=<br/>This temperament is so damn important it needs to have its own page<br/>and family and everything. This temperament is one of the most damn<br/>important things in the entire regular temperament paradigm. In fact,<br/>2.3.5.7.11 mohajira should be a proper extension of THIS guy, and get<br/>off the page which has it as some weird secondary 11-limit extension<br/>of meantone.</p><p>The two most popular unofficial names for this are &quot;mohajira&quot; and<br/>&quot;maqamic,&quot; both higher-limit temperaments that this is a valid<br/>restriction of. This is important enough that it needs a single valid<br/>name. It&apos;s unfortunately going by the name of<br/>&quot;mohajira/maqamic/beatles/hemififths/neutralthirds/oh to hell with it&quot;<br/>temperament though, because nobody knows what to call it. I&apos;ve<br/>proposed &quot;mohajira&quot; above because it&apos;s the oldest as per Graham&apos;s<br/>request, and it also makes sense.</p><p>This one lends itself immediately to a great family structure that<br/>should be taken advantage of. For instance, it branches off right away<br/>to <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a>, adding 81/80, and <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a>, adding 64/63. This is<br/>obviously the &quot;mohajira&quot; branch of the family. The <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a><br/>temperament as it stands is currently called &quot;mohajira,&quot; but there&apos;s<br/>really no reason it shouldn&apos;t just be the <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> extension of<br/>&quot;mohajira&quot;, especially since its best 2.3.5.7.11-limit extension is<br/>also called &quot;mohajira&quot;!</p><p>The other main branch is the <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a> extension adding 64/63. Since<br/>the other common name for this neutral thirds temperament is maqamic,<br/>and since 2.3.5.7.11 maqamic is an extension of this adding 36/35,<br/>then this might as well be maqamic.</p><p>There are other extensions as well, like the <a href="http://2.3.11.13">2.3.11.13</a> branch adding<br/>144/143, and maybe other <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a> branches. They should all be in this<br/>family!</p><p>Any objections? I think that this would be pretty huge to clear up.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104690 href="#104690">ðŸ”—</a>keenan_pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2012 9:30:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; These are things which should define their own familes just like<br/>&gt; meantone 2.3.5 81/80 does, or semaphore 2.3.7 49/48 does, and which<br/>&gt; ought to have extensions in extension groups of the subgroup just like<br/>&gt; any other good rank-2 temperament does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you know, these temperaments already have a plethora of possible<br/>&gt; names due to Keenan&apos;s naming scheme. 2.3.7 12&amp;17 is 2.3.7 superpyth,<br/>&gt; 2.3.7 dominant, and so on.

Did you mean<br/>something else?</p><p>As for why people call it superpyth - if you play around with<br/>superpyth in 22-EDO or 27-EDO, the mapping for 5, or 5/3, or 7/5, or<br/>any simple ratio involving 5 doesn&apos;t appear in the diatonic scale at<br/>all, so it&apos;s quite natural to think of it as a 2.3.7 temperament &quot;with<br/>some other mapping for 5 that doesn&apos;t turn up much.&quot; So it&apos;s common to<br/>hear people talk about superpyth in 17-EDO and such too, despite that<br/>superpyth is only in 17p and not 17c, because people aren&apos;t thinking<br/>of the mapping for 5 at all. On the other hand, dominant[7] does have<br/>both 5 and 7 turn up, so there&apos;s no reason to think of it as a<br/>subgroup temperament and that name didn&apos;t catch on.</p><p>&quot;They&quot; are the usual group of newer theorists/composers who also like<br/>regular mapping theory. I&apos;ll list Keenan, Ryan, John M, Andrew<br/>Heathwaite, Jacob Barton, Igs, and myself as people I can remember<br/>calling it &quot;superpyth&quot; off the top of my head. &quot;Meantone&quot; usually<br/>means the temperament mapping the thirds to 5/4 and 6/5, &quot;superpyth&quot;<br/>is the one mapping them to 9/7 and 7/6, and &quot;dominant&quot; is the one that<br/>mixes the two.

Unfortunately, without the above<br/>tool in place, it&apos;s not clear which subgroup temperaments even need<br/>naming at all, or which is the &quot;best subgroup restriction&quot; of some<br/>full-limit temperament which the temperament should be an extension of<br/>(or how to break ties if there&apos;s more than one contender).</p><p>Even more importantly, though, it still wouldn&apos;t be clear when to use<br/>the systematic names given by an algorithm, vs when you should pick a<br/>name for the family directly as a &quot;seed&quot; to use in future names. We<br/>probably don&apos;t want any more names if we can avoid them, but there are<br/>probably times when the &quot;obvious name&quot; for a temperament will conflict<br/>with the results of the algorithm, and in that case the obvious name<br/>should be grandfathered in. My criteria for when to grandfather a name<br/>in would be one of more of the following</p><p>1) There&apos;s already another name which is in common use, and which<br/>doesn&apos;t conflict with the temperament structure or the basics of RMP<br/>in general<br/>2) There&apos;s some reasonable consensus that another name would be better<br/>3) The &quot;correct&quot; name to use is more or less obvious</p><p>There are probably only four or five names I&apos;d propose as meeting this<br/>criterion, most of which were already handled - obvious things like<br/>&quot;semaphore&quot; and &quot;superpyth.&quot; There might be one or two left I think<br/>should be assigned official names that correspond to their existing<br/>unofficial names. Other than that, the rest should be done<br/>algorithmically, and I think the first step to solving that problem<br/>the right way is to come up with the proper superbadness measure<br/>first.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104706 href="#104706">ðŸ”—</a>Dong Bin Choi &#x3C;dtothefourthchoi@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2012 4:23:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I prefer &quot;maqamic&quot; for 2.3.11 243/242 because that name makes an obvious<br/>connection to maqam music. &quot;Mohajira&quot; would be too esoteric for such a<br/>basic temperament family and no one would immediately recognize the<br/>rationale for the name.</p><p>In what source did Jacque Dudon call  2.3.11 243/242 &quot;mohajira&quot;?</p><p>On Mon, Jun 4, 2012 at 7:12 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt; We&apos;ve sorted out 2.3.7 49/48, which is now &quot;semaphore.&quot; Two others<br/>&gt; which really badly need sorting out are 2.3.7 12&amp;17 and 2.3.11 7&amp;17,<br/>&gt; which are arguably even more important. We currently have naming<br/>&gt; confusion surrounding those just like we did with semaphore. I think<br/>&gt; we should do again what we did with semaphore and try to organize<br/>&gt; things in a nice clean way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These are things which should define their own familes just like<br/>&gt; meantone 2.3.5 81/80 does, or semaphore 2.3.7 49/48 does, and which<br/>&gt; ought to have extensions in extension groups of the subgroup just like<br/>&gt; any other good rank-2 temperament does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you know, these temperaments already have a plethora of possible<br/>&gt; names due to Keenan&apos;s naming scheme. 2.3.7 12&amp;17 is 2.3.7 superpyth,<br/>&gt; 2.3.7 dominant, and so on. Likewise, 2.3.5 meantone is also 2.3.5<br/>&gt; dominant, 2.3.5 meanenneadecal, etc. However, 2.3.5 meantone also has<br/>&gt; one main name, which is &quot;meantone.&quot; Below I propose what the main name<br/>&gt; for each temperament should be to make everything as clear as<br/>&gt; possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; =2.3.7 12&amp;17 64/63 - SUPERPYTH=<br/>&gt; Sometimes I think that this is the most conceptually important rank-2<br/>&gt; temperament after meantone, if not the most exotic. It&apos;s gone through<br/>&gt; a few different names. At one point I think &quot;septipyth&quot; was being<br/>&gt; floated around, and now it&apos;s called &quot;archy&quot; on the wiki. Almost<br/>&gt; everyone calls this &quot;superpyth,&quot; and it is indeed 2.3.7 superpyth.<br/>&gt; Much like how we swapped &quot;semiphore&quot; with &quot;semaphore,&quot; I think it<br/>&gt; would be nice to call this &quot;superpyth&quot; and leave the &quot;archy&quot; to the<br/>&gt; <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 64/63 rank-3 temperament. Then the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> temperament is just<br/>&gt; an extension of superpyth, which it is, and then superpyth and<br/>&gt; suprapyth are two 11-limit extensions, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A wrinkle arises in this case that didn&apos;t with semaphore. In this<br/>&gt; case, Graham&apos;s temperament finder also calls this &quot;superpyth&quot;:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22_5&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=22_5&limit=5</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This name is not on the wiki, so I&apos;m not sure if there&apos;s a conflict or<br/>&gt; if it&apos;s supposed to be that way. However, note that this superpyth is<br/>&gt; indeed 2.3.5 superpyth using Keenan&apos;s naming scheme, so it&apos;s not a<br/>&gt; false name. However, note that 2.3.5 superpyth is not in the 2.3.7<br/>&gt; superpyth family, so it might be wise to call this something else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One solution presents itself from that I note Erv Wilson and John<br/>&gt; Chalmers are both talking about it in Xenharmonikon 1 (!!), which<br/>&gt; means they might have precedence anyway. Maybe John Chalmers can weigh<br/>&gt; in on who first worked it out. This could be Chalmers or Wilson<br/>&gt; temperament. I dunno. Point is, 2.3.7 64/63 should definitely be<br/>&gt; superpyth too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; =2.3.11 7&amp;17 1029/1024 - MOHAJIRA=<br/>&gt; This temperament is so damn important it needs to have its own page<br/>&gt; and family and everything. This temperament is one of the most damn<br/>&gt; important things in the entire regular temperament paradigm. In fact,<br/>&gt; 2.3.5.7.11 mohajira should be a proper extension of THIS guy, and get<br/>&gt; off the page which has it as some weird secondary 11-limit extension<br/>&gt; of meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The two most popular unofficial names for this are &quot;mohajira&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;maqamic,&quot; both higher-limit temperaments that this is a valid<br/>&gt; restriction of. This is important enough that it needs a single valid<br/>&gt; name. It&apos;s unfortunately going by the name of<br/>&gt; &quot;mohajira/maqamic/beatles/hemififths/neutralthirds/oh to hell with it&quot;<br/>&gt; temperament though, because nobody knows what to call it. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; proposed &quot;mohajira&quot; above because it&apos;s the oldest as per Graham&apos;s<br/>&gt; request, and it also makes sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This one lends itself immediately to a great family structure that<br/>&gt; should be taken advantage of. For instance, it branches off right away<br/>&gt; to <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a>, adding 81/80, and <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a>, adding 64/63. This is<br/>&gt; obviously the &quot;mohajira&quot; branch of the family. The <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a><br/>&gt; temperament as it stands is currently called &quot;mohajira,&quot; but there&apos;s<br/>&gt; really no reason it shouldn&apos;t just be the <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> extension of<br/>&gt; &quot;mohajira&quot;, especially since its best 2.3.5.7.11-limit extension is<br/>&gt; also called &quot;mohajira&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other main branch is the <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a> extension adding 64/63. Since<br/>&gt; the other common name for this neutral thirds temperament is maqamic,<br/>&gt; and since 2.3.5.7.11 maqamic is an extension of this adding 36/35,<br/>&gt; then this might as well be maqamic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are other extensions as well, like the <a href="http://2.3.11.13">2.3.11.13</a> branch adding<br/>&gt; 144/143, and maybe other <a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a> branches. They should all be in this<br/>&gt; family!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any objections?
