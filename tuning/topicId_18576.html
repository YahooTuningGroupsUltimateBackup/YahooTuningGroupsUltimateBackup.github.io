I<br/>have converted the file to MONO .mp3 and the illusion seems very<br/>effective...  I guess the entrance of the shakuhachi partials may be<br/>a little &quot;interruptive&quot; because of the &quot;overblowing&quot; timbre, but<br/>otherwise the &quot;Escher&quot; effect seems quite smooth...</p><p>________ _____ __ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
