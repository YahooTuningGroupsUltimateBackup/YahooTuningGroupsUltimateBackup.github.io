I began on 7th, and then found the midi<br/>&gt; files were for 5th.  Back to the library for more<br/>&gt; Mahler scores ;-)</p><p>the one i&apos;d really like to hear is the 7th.<br/>you can find my MIDI version of the 1st movement<br/>of the 7th here:</p><p><a href="http://www.classicalarchives.com/main/m.html">http://www.classicalarchives.com/main/m.html</a></p><p>(if that link doesn&apos;t work, just use<br/><a href="http://classicalarchives.com">classicalarchives.com</a> and click on &quot;M&quot;)</p><p>BTW, the copyrights on Mahler&apos;s work have<br/>just run out over the past few years, and<br/>so they&apos;re now public domain.  the scores<br/>are being reprinted by discount houses such<br/>as Dover, and they&apos;re much cheaper than they<br/>used to be.  (i spent a fortune on them when<br/>i was young.)</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=44663 href="#44663">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2003 1:24:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; the one i&apos;d really like to hear is the 7th.</p><p>In lieu of an actual meantone version, I&apos;m working on getting a grail<br/>version.
