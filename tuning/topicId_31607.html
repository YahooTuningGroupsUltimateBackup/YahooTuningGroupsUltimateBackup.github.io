If so you would have seen the ^ and v notated with<br/>up and down slashes through ordinary noteheads. A useful feature of Sibelius.

In all cases?</p><p>Tablature I like, and it makes life easy for the guitarist. Now that I have a new instrument<br/>chamber ensemble on the way I intend after the Blackjack project(s) to arrange some existing 22<br/>tet pieces and write some new ones for the instruments (I&apos;ve added 5 strings to the 17 string<br/>psalteries). I&apos;ll also be able to incorporate 22 tet guitar into the ensemble. That&apos;s why I&apos;m<br/>looking for a reliable and efficient system of notation across the board. I agree entirely that<br/>&quot;consonant dominant seventh chords&quot; benefit from familiar notation as you point out.</p><p>I am also fascinated by Partch&apos;s many and various systems of notation. But I&apos;d like to keep things<br/>as familiar as possible for the conventionally trained musicians &apos;round here. At least in the<br/>beginning.</p><p>Through lack of time I haven&apos;t had a good look at your notation system. I&apos;ll put some time aside<br/>over the next week or so and no doubt will have some questions to ask.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &quot;key&quot; for the Dynamic Symmetrical Minor that would leave open<br/>&gt; &gt; strings in the key would be : -<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; G, Ab ^, A , Bb^ , B, Db^, D, Eb^, E, F^ .  Four flats and five ^<br/>&gt; symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly seems preferable, don&apos;t you think? There&apos;s one other<br/>&gt; possibility also that uses all the open strings.</p><p>Can&apos;t find any other &apos;Symmetricals&apos; unless it&apos;s the mode of the above starting on Db^.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I&apos;m very excited to see this stuff, and I will be following<br/>&gt; your webpage closely as it develops, at some point actually going<br/>&gt; home and trying everyting on my 22-tET guitar. I&apos;m also excited to<br/>&gt; see someone actually following through with my ideas in real music-<br/>&gt; making -- I think you&apos;re only the fourth person to do that.</p><p>Well, at some point I felt that if I was going to understand the harmonic resources of this<br/>temperament I&apos;d have to do do some digging. The lattices have been most helpful and once I&apos;ve<br/>figured out the useful structures I&apos;ll chart them out and notate. As things go along I&apos;ll get<br/>round to looking at the &apos;Pentachordals&apos;. I need to add a note to the effect that all the<br/>&apos;Symmetricals&apos; are modes of each other and likewise the &apos;Pentachordals&apos;.</p><p>&gt; P.S. How did you come to choose Dynamic Symmetrical Minor? Do you<br/>&gt; dislike the &quot;perfect fourth&quot; scale degree?</p><p>No, I started there because I knew little about its properties and because there were a couple of<br/>useful lattices, one in each of your papers.</p><p>Best wishes.</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 12:01:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m sure that a solution has been found for this but my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestion would be to rename<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some notes, eg, G# instead of Ab,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You mean G#v instead of Ab^?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and also along the lines of  your examples below.
