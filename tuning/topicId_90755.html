Yasser used centitones (600 to the octave) in A Theory of Evolving Tonality, but I&apos;ve not seen them used elsewhere. A.G. Piklers article Logarithmic Frequency Systems, Journal of the Acoustic Society of America 39(6): 1102-1120, 1966 is the most comprehensive I know of, but it&apos;s limited to the literature pre-1965.</p><p>The late composer Paul Beaver suggested &quot;Harmos,&quot; the cycle of 1728 to the octave (12 cubed) in duodecimal notation to me. This system divides the semitone into 144 parts. For Bohlen-Pierce fans, 1300 to the 3/1 might be useful.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>Tony &#x3C;leopold_plumtree@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2010 11:00:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I also like a system that divides the octave purely dozenally/duodecimally.  The (minor) problem I have with cents is that it&apos;s a multiple-radix system (dozenal and decimal hybrid), not the fact it has anything to do with twelve.  A single base unit and single number base, be it ten or twelve, is all that&apos;s needed.</p><p>Beyond intervals, binary logs in dozenal or decimal notation can be used for specifying pitch.  Something of an absolute interval compared against the second.</p><p>&gt; The late composer Paul Beaver suggested &quot;Harmos,&quot; the cycle of 1728 to<br/>&gt; the octave (12 cubed) in duodecimal notation to me.

Plus, everything gets adjusted from your 1/1 symmetrically, the way we&apos;d like it to be.</p></div>
