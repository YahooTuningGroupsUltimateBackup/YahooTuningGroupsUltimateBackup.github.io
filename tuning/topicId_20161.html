I use it too, and I find more and more that it<br/>just won&apos;t accommodate my tunings.  Really sad too.</p><p>&gt; If I understand the Antares propaganda, along with some<br/>clarification by<br/>&gt; a tech-support person, correctly, the new version of Auto-Tune lets<br/>you<br/>&gt; send it MIDI note and pitch-bend messages whereby you can tell it<br/>what<br/>&gt; pitch to retune digital audio to.  In concept then, there should be<br/>&gt; nothing stopping you from retuning &quot;real&quot; instruments to arbitrary<br/>&gt; tunings.</p><p>I still think this is an unforTUNEate solution!  Why couldn&apos;t they<br/>just simply make it where you could type in cents values? With this<br/>you&apos;ve got to get your external gear involved.  The big problem with<br/>this for me, is I don&apos;t usually work with &quot;pitch bend&quot; retunings with<br/>synths and such. They still don&apos;t have this where it needs to be for<br/>total flexibility.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve used Auto-Tune a bit, and so far I&apos;ve been impressed with its<br/>&gt; ability to change tuning of monophonic digital audio with<br/>surprisingly<br/>&gt; little effect upon other aspects of that audio.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s great for ironing out wavering pitch samples, but when I<br/>look at the list of scales it will tune to, I feel left out in the<br/>cold by Antares.</p><p>Gary - if you get this and try it out with the pitch bend midi, will<br/>you please let me know how it worked out for you? This is important<br/>to me as well.</p><p>Thanks for this update,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MR88CET@TEXAS.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2001 5:53:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I still think this is an unforTUNEate solution!  Why couldn&apos;t they<br/>&gt; just simply make it where you could type in cents values?</p><p>Yes, I&apos;d prefer to have user-definable tunings, but I&apos;ll be happy with this as a first step.  It<br/>is, at least, a nearly general solution, it can realize a wide variety of tunings.</p><p>I told them that if they&apos;d just provide an option to read a raw ASCII text file newline-separated<br/>of frequencies to quantize pitch to (with no implied repetition in octaves), that would be<br/>minimally sufficient, and a major step forward.  Scala, JICalc, and such could take over from<br/>there.  I then supplied some successively more elegant alternatives.</p></div>
