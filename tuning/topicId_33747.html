Tunings in and of themselves never do this for<br/>me. Tuning music never doers this for me. I&apos;ll take new instruments<br/>and new sounds with their often randomly tuned approach over<br/>theoretically righteous new tunings all day.

I was going to wait until I had *completely* studied the<br/>&gt; Ozzard-Low the *second* time, but I&apos;ve *almost* done that, so it&apos;s<br/>&gt; time to comment!  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Over the holidays, I visited a friend in Michigan who sells pianos.<br/>&gt; He&apos;s *always* handled *acoustic* pianos, mostly uprights, but tried<br/>a<br/>&gt; beautiful store with magnificent concert grands.  That enterprise<br/>&gt; failed miserably...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In any case, he was asking me about MIDI keyboards and so forth a<br/>few<br/>&gt; years ago.  Apparently he didn&apos;t know much about them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, *this* year I asked him about his business and I asked him<br/>&gt; what percentage of *electronic* pianos he was selling *this* year.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His answer?  That&apos;s all I&apos;m selling now...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There has been a seismic shift toward electronic instruments in the<br/>&gt; last few years and, of course, this trend has been coupled with the<br/>&gt; microprocessing of computers.  This is one reason, I believe, that<br/>&gt; microtonality is going more and more into the mainstream.  *More*<br/>&gt; people own equipment that can play microtonality... mostly MIDI<br/>&gt; keyboards, than ever before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There have also been other important aesthetic changes.  A few years<br/>&gt; ago electronic composers weren&apos;t taken seriously unless they worked<br/>&gt; in music schools that had a *lot* of equipment.  I *know* because I<br/>&gt; was trying to do &quot;independent&quot; work in those days and was<br/>&gt; solidly &quot;dissed...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, this aesthetic has changed.  I&apos;ve seen &quot;calls for scores&quot;<br/>&gt; for electronic instruments of late where the only criterion is that<br/>&gt; the sound source is something that one &quot;plugs in!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, many groups, such as _Bang on a Can_ in New York, and<br/>&gt; other &quot;prestigious&quot; groups have a *wide* variety of electrically-<br/>&gt; produced pieces.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So my point?  Simply that our current &quot;modern&quot; sound is more<br/>&gt; electronic than ever before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Ok... I&apos;m waiting for a barrage of disagreement from our &quot;acoustic<br/>&gt; set&quot; here... probably Kraig Grady and several others, but I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; say *everybody* should do this, only that it&apos;s an overall trend...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is true, and of course these are sentiments expressed by<br/>Ivor<br/>&gt; Darreg before just about anybody, then it means that, quite<br/>possibly,<br/>&gt; the sound of acoustic instruments is *antiquated.*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now don&apos;t get me wrong.  I&apos;m not totally dissing &quot;antiquated...&quot;<br/>I&apos;m<br/>&gt; just saying that it may turn out that our present orchestral<br/>&gt; instruments will be considered species of an &quot;early music&quot;<br/>&gt; only &quot;early music&quot; will *eventually* mean the music of the 19th<br/>&gt; Century and, possibly, the 20th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is true, (My acoustic &quot;enemies&quot; are now waiting for me in a<br/>&gt; dark alley by this time in this short post) then it means the<br/>&gt; addition of an electronic component to &quot;traditional&quot; instruments is<br/>&gt; not only inevitable, but it will &quot;redefine&quot; the sounds of so-<br/>&gt; called &quot;art music.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In other words, we won&apos;t *expect* the acoustic sound so much any<br/>&gt; more... particularly since sampling is getting so good and an<br/>&gt; instrument like, for example, the electronic piano, is sounding<br/>&quot;good<br/>&gt; enough&quot; to satisfy many people.  Sure, the enharmonicity is missing,<br/>&gt; and the instrument might not do so well in playing Beethoven or<br/>&gt; Chopin, but the point is, nobody is going to *use* that instrument<br/>&gt; for &quot;authentic&quot; performances of Beethoven or Chopin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beethoven and Chopin will be &quot;early music...&quot; and these pieces will<br/>&gt; be performed on &quot;period&quot; instruments, i.e. *ACOUSTIC* pianos, and<br/>&gt; hopefully, as Ed Foote does and others, in the *correct* tunings of<br/>&gt; the day as well...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what does this mean for our discussion?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, it means that the addition of an *electronic* component to<br/>&gt; instruments, such as woodwinds, is not such a &quot;big deal.&quot;  Quite<br/>&gt; possibly we will &quot;get used&quot; to the electronically-modified sounds<br/>and<br/>&gt; the &quot;real&quot; sounds of acoustic instruments will sound and<br/>&gt; seem &quot;antiquated&quot; or &quot;period&quot; pieces.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If that be the case, which is the *premise* of this post (please<br/>save<br/>&gt; the eggs and tomatoes until *after* the post has concluded) then it<br/>&gt; means that having some kind of &quot;translation&quot; of the *performed*<br/>pitch<br/>&gt; of a woodwind, let&apos;s say, is &quot;no big deal&quot;...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The performer will just play *normally* and with a *foot pedal* or<br/>&gt; some such, could play the *alterations* for 72-tET, for instance...<br/>&gt; with only *three* necessary, of course, the 1/12 of a whole tone,<br/>the<br/>&gt; 1/6th of a whole tone and the quarter tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would all be done by *alteration* of the existing tone by some<br/>&gt; kind of adaptive mechanism, more akin to the present &quot;MIDI<br/>&gt; controllers&quot; for woodwinds today.  Of course, those are not really<br/>&gt; *excellent* instruments yet.  *That* development will have to take<br/>&gt; place... but I mean a *fine* instrument that has the capability to<br/>&gt; electronically alter the sound as post-processing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems this is a *much* more logical and inevitable development<br/>&gt; than the so-called &quot;logical&quot; instruments which demand electronic<br/>&gt; alteration of the *acoustic* mechanical mechanisms of traditional<br/>&gt; instruments.  Not only is it *much* more difficult to make such<br/>&gt; instruments but the point is, *nobody will appreciate them* since<br/>&gt; the &quot;contemporary&quot; sound that people will expect will be an<br/>&gt; *electronic* one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok.. now is the time for the tomatoes...  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And, by the way, if anyone wants to place a *bet* about all this, I<br/>&gt; know I will collect, and will expect to in 100 years!   :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
