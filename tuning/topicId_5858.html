In contrast, he excludes the minor second<br/>&gt;(256:243) and tritone (729:512).</p><p>As we&apos;ve discussed before, the &quot;odd-limit&quot; concept for ranking consonance<br/>only makes sense when the intervals involved in the comparison are<br/>unambiguosly heard as the ratios which they are representing. Ratios of 729,<br/>of 243, of 81, and even of 27 cannot realistically be placed in this<br/>category. It&apos;s that &quot;tolerance&quot; thing we keep mentioning. Guido could be<br/>said to be advocating, within the Pythagorean universe, a 9-limit standard<br/>for polyphonic acceptability, with a tolerance of at least a syntonic comma.<br/>Certainly vocal music of 1030, the combination of performance and auditory<br/>uncertainties could easily add up to a tolerance for error greater than a<br/>syntonic comma.</p><p>Same goes for Garlandia, de Liege, and Jacobus.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s judgments are likely guided by an overarching heptatonic<br/>(diatonic) melodic sense. Where intervals (such as 11:9 and 18:11) fall<br/>between two diatonic intervals subtended by the same number of scale steps,<br/>the categorical classification imprinted by a lifetime of musical experience<br/>is clear and the perception less confused than that of intervals (such as<br/>9:7, 12:7, and 7:6) which fall between intervals subtended by different<br/>numbers of steps.</p></div>
