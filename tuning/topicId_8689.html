That is how I teach them to seek<br/>the &quot;most agreeable&quot; tunings. I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;m on firm ground when I<br/>suggest that the tendency to move the third higher when the fifth is<br/>introduced has nothing to do with &quot;standing out.&quot; To the contrary, the<br/>singers are asked _not to stand out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was going to say, &quot;Anyhow, hopefully someone can analyze Jerry&apos;s mp3 and<br/>&gt; determine exactly what intervals are in this chord.&quot;</p><p>Since the audio level is so low (not of my choosing but of circumstantial<br/>limitations), it may be possible to extract two slices of sound--one from<br/>the pre-fifth tuning and one from the post-fifth tuning--and loop each of<br/>them to create flows of consistent pitches and then match these by ear to<br/>newly created ones for ballpark (at least) analysis.</p><p>&gt; But then I listened to<br/>&gt; it. It&apos;s a mess.</p><p>Glad you liked it, Paul.</p><p>&gt; Each singer is wavering within a large band, and the fact<br/>&gt; that multiple singers are singing the &quot;same&quot; pitch, creating erratic beats<br/>&gt; with one another (in addition to the technical problem of distinguishing<br/>&gt; overtones of low notes from fundamentals of high notes, and dealing with the<br/>&gt; beats between the two), is going to make a precise analysis of the intervals<br/>&gt; impossible (please don&apos;t let that stop anyone from trying to get some<br/>&gt; approximate cent numbers, though!). If this is what Jerry considers<br/>&gt; &quot;locking&quot;, I suggest he re-evaluate his position on the ~1&#xFFFD; accuracy of some<br/>&gt; synthesizers being insufficient to find the true &quot;locking&quot; intervals. Or is<br/>&gt; this just a &quot;student&quot; choir?</p><p>Perhaps you missed it, Paul. The whole idea here was to use inexperienced<br/>students for this experiment in order to minimize cultural conditioning, a<br/>factor that has appeared important to you (and to me as well). The first<br/>phase was to teach them to seek &quot;best&quot; tuning by ear, trying not to<br/>influence their &quot;up and down&quot; choices other than verifying when they arrive<br/>at a &quot;lock.&quot; They were not told to expect the third to rise when the fifth<br/>was introduced.</p><p>My initial intent was to do this with the college choir, but the EKG<br/>condensor mic I brought had a burned out battery in its power pac. The<br/>dynamic mic at my disposal (an SM 58--great up close but not for groups)<br/>didn&apos;t pick up much sound. So, rather than postpone five days until I met<br/>the choir again, I opted for doing the demo with another class that I would<br/>meet that day. There are seven men and three women participating.</p><p>One girl, an outstanding student with great ears (a cello player), had been<br/>blown away in an earlier class when I played the the piano&apos;s third under the<br/>two circumstances in question. This reaction by pitch sensitive people is<br/>fairly predictable to me after performing this demonstration many dozens of<br/>times with singers of varying skill levels. It _always works.</p><p>Interestingly, when repeating the demonstration in dry runs in preparation<br/>for recording it, the sopranos occasionally sang the &quot;high third&quot; (likely<br/>from pitch memory rather than from seeking locked tuning) even before the<br/>fifth was sounding. I know that experienced singers/players sometimes favor<br/>the &quot;high third&quot; even when the fifth is not sounding (me, for example) and<br/>apparently these students were accepting it as the optimum lock. A student<br/>suggested changing the key from one practice to the next, and that solved<br/>the problem. They consistently began with the &quot;low&quot; third thereafter.</p><p>On the day of the recording, a new student joined the group who had not yet<br/>developed basic &quot;locking&quot; skills. Since I do not (on principle) exclude<br/>students from any class activity that might injure their self confidence, it<br/>meant quickly training the newbie and trying to get a reasonable<br/>demonstration. I replayed the last &quot;take&quot; in my earphones and thought it<br/>demonstrated the point, so I settled for it. After all, making recordings<br/>for the Tuning List is not the purpose of the class, and I had already taken<br/>up a good portion of the class time in providing the basic training.</p><p>When I got it home, I noticed the flaws that I described on my post.<br/>Nevertheless, it clearly demonstrated the phenomenon, so I went with<br/>it--mess and all.</p><p>By the way, I don&apos;t need to reconsidering my &quot;stand&quot; on a synth&apos;s inability<br/>to provide locking intervals. I simply reported my perceptual frustration<br/>while attempting to find a locking interval.  I can hear it in voices with<br/>no problem, but not in synthesizers. My &quot;mind&quot; is not closed on the subject,<br/>it is just waiting to be convinced one way or the other.</p><p>Onward!</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
