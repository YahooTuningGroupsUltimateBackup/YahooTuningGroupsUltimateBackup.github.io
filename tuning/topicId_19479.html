Split keys offered a rather convenient way to exceed the<br/>limitations of restricted temperaments and tunings in keyboard<br/>instruments, since the essential features of these temperaments were<br/>kept, like for example the pure major thirds of meantone temperament.<br/>Usaully the split keys in the small and one-stroke octave were &quot;broken&quot;<br/>to provide additional keys. Occasionally notes in the two-stroke octave<br/>also were broken, but only eb&apos;&apos;/d#&apos;&apos; (more frequent) and g#&apos;&apos;/ab&apos;&apos; (less frequent).</p><p>Split keys in pythagorean tuning</p><p>There are hints provided by Christopher Stembridge and L. F. Tagliavini,<br/>that split keys were already used in organs tuned in pythagorean tuning<br/>in the middle of the 15th century, but at the same time meantone<br/>temperament rose and lead to a greater interest in adding the &quot;tasti<br/>spezzati&quot; or &quot;subsemitonia&quot;.<br/>The pythagorean example given by Stembridge and Tagliavini is from an<br/>intarsia showing an extra key between E and F. This may be interpreted as</p><p>ex. 1             B - F#- C#- G#<br/>                 / \ / \ / \ /<br/>Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>or</p><p>ex. 2             E - B - F#- C#<br/>                 / \ / \ / \ /<br/>Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A</p><p>I write the pythagorean tuning with it&apos;s &quot;schismatic&quot; major thirds (very<br/>close to pure) as a cut-out of the fifth-third-net of just intonation.<br/>Example Nr. 1 could be written as a straiught chain as well:  Cb- Gb-<br/>Db- Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E,<br/>but Cb- Gb- Db- Ab- serve as very good major thirds B - F#- C#- G#.<br/>Especially in an organ the &quot;drawing together effect&quot; might render these<br/>pure to the listener.</p><p>The split key between E and F would add either the E above C (to ex. 1)</p><p>ex. 3         E - B - F#- C#- G#<br/>             / \ / \ / \ / \ /<br/>Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>or the pure fifth E to A</p><p>ex. 4             E - B - F#- C#<br/>                 / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E</p><p>Meantone extension</p><p>In an italian organ around 1500 (four such organs are known before),<br/>tuned in (some) meantone temperament, the first key to be split might be<br/>the a-flat, provided with the g# (as back key) - as can be seen in the<br/>(reconstructed) keyboards of the 2 famous organs in Bologna, Italy, S.<br/>Petronio, the older one from 1475, getting split keys during the rebuilt<br/>by G. B. Facchetti in 1528-1531 and the other organ from 1596 built by<br/>B. Malamini.<br/>Others started with doubling eb/d#.</p><p>Later it became usual to split consequently: eb/d#, g#/ab (g# being in<br/>front), bb/a# then c#/db (seldom). There are only two organs known which<br/>had all these 4 split sharps and in both cases all concentrated in one<br/>octave span:<br/>Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel, Germany, Hauptkirche BMV, 1620-1624 G. Fritzsche,  and<br/>Sciacca, Italy, S. Margherita, 1639 G. Sutera and V. Monteleone</p><p>Not one known organ with less than 19 notes per octave had *all split<br/>keys (or more) as subsemitones, like the &quot;enharmonic&quot; instruments.</p><p>The pattern with eb/d# and g#/ab (14 notes/pitches per octave) seems to<br/>have been frequent. It provides the following possibilities,<br/>symmetrically ordered around the fifth of the 1st mode D-A.</p><p>ex. 5    - D#<br/>        \ / \<br/>       - B - F#- C#- G# -<br/>      \ / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>     - G - D - A - E -<br/>    \ / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>   - Eb- Bb- F - C -<br/>              \ / \<br/>               Ab-</p><p>   Here the dashes indicate<br/>   -  meantone fifths<br/>   /  pure major thirds<br/>   \  minor thirds (as defined by the two previous)<br/>   lines with &quot;open end&quot; find their continuation in the next row below<br/>or above</p><p>d&apos; was also the middle, symmetrical key on the keyboards with short<br/>octave CDEFGA-c&apos;&apos;&apos;.</p><p>The keyboard in the bass would look like</p><p>      D   E   Bb<br/>C   F   G   A   B   c</p><p>The short octave might have originated from the previous<br/>FGAB-g&apos;&apos;,a&apos;&apos;-compass by adding the C to the left of the keyboard and the<br/>D and E at the indicated places. Some F-keyboards seem to have been<br/>actually based on D (same pattern, but without the C).</p><p>How important the symmetrical aspect might have been regarded is<br/>difficult to say. Amazing is in this respect that the keyboards until<br/>ca. 1700 were rather equipped with extra notes in the bass for F# and<br/>G#, built as split keys (but which are not &quot;subsemitones&quot;) as well:</p><p>      F#  G#<br/>      D   E   Bb<br/>C   F   G   A   B   c</p><p>There are a few keyboard designs, deviating from the above sketched<br/>patterns, apparently &quot;omitting&quot; certain keys, like doubling<br/>eb/d# and bb/a#, leaving out the frequent g#/ab), or providing<br/>g#/ab and c#/db , but not eb/d#<br/>whichs possible purpose is explained below.</p><p>A Very Short History</p><p>It seems to have been Italian organ builders of the mid-15th-C. who were<br/>the first to apply split keys in organ building. Not surprising Italy<br/>was the main center of this development for the first 150 years and<br/>nearly half of the instruments we know of today are to be found in this<br/>country. Until 1600 we leran about 19 organs. From Italy the idea might<br/>have spread to Spain (the picture within Spain still remains somewhat unclear).</p><p>In Italy the development seems to faded out after 1660, but shortly<br/>after 1600 however, Germany, which was dominated by musicians under<br/>Italian influence, took a central position. Split keys were promoted by<br/>the leader of the Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel court chapel, Michael Praetorius, and the<br/>Saxon court organ builder Gottfried Fritzsche. Other promoters were f.<br/>example Henrich Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;tz (Dresden) and Jacob Praetorius (Hamburg), both<br/>knowing and cooperating with each other and with Fritzsche. Dresden was<br/>the first organ norther of the alps in which split keys were applied<br/>(Schlick 1511 reports a failed attempt at an unknown place by two<br/>unknown builders). The chapel organ was built by G. Fritzsche in<br/>1612-1614 after having planned it together with Sch&iuml;&iquest;&half;tz&apos; predecessor as<br/>chapel master of the electoral court, Hans Leo Hassler. It is hoped by<br/>the way that in the near future this organ will be reconstructed in the<br/>as well reconstructed Dresden castle.</p><p>The Manderscheidt-family originally working in and around N&iuml;&iquest;&half;rnberg<br/>(Nuremberg) has to be mentioned too, because they produced several<br/>positives, but also bigger church organs like the recently restored<br/>choir organ in Fribourg, Switzerland, St. Nicolas, built 1654-1657 by<br/>Sebald Manderscheidt.</p><p>From these geographical area the idea spread further to surrounding<br/>regions and countries:<br/>- Denmark:         only one example known, probably an organ builder<br/>                   of Saxon origin (the courts of Denmark and saxony<br/>                   were dynastically linked)<br/>- Sweden:          the only country were also local organ builders<br/>                   took the practice over.<br/>- the Netherlands: the northwest-German organ builder family<br/>                   van Hagerbeer (1630ies/1640ies)<br/>- Switzerland:     Manderscheidt-family (s. above) ca. 1650<br/>- England:         2 organs known, by Bernard Smith (Bernhard Schmidt)<br/>                   in the 1680ies</p><p>In France this tradition did not prevail, there is no safe evidence for<br/>organs with split keys (even not the one example in Paris, St. Nicolas<br/>des Champs, 1632-1636, C. Carlier, is known whether it was realized) and<br/>the Gamba-player Jean-Jaques Rousseau confirmed in 1697 that this<br/>tradition was not to be found in France, contrary to Italy.</p><p>At the end of the 17th century there are still large organs built with 3<br/>manuals and pedal in Sweden and Germany, whcih contained 3 split<br/>keys/octave, namely eb/d#, g#/ab and bb/a#, sometimes even going down to<br/>the great octave (Bb/A# occurs), which usually did not happen (Italian<br/>early compasses down to FF, 12-foot, excluded).</p><p>With the rise of circulating temperaments the practice disappeared soon<br/>after 1700. The last organ was built by J. and V. F. Bossart in<br/>1716-1721 in Luzern (Switzerland), St. Urban.<br/>About 70 Instruments with 13-16 keys per octave are known today to have<br/>been built during the time sketched above.</p><p>The historical informed performance practice movemend lead organ<br/>builders to build organs in meantone tuning again and so the split keys<br/>came back into modern organ building.<br/>With the return of historical oriented organ building and the rise of<br/>historical temperaments and tunings in the practice of instrument<br/>building and performance practice split keys have become a more and more<br/>frequent feature again since the 1970ies, after an interlude of nearly<br/>300 years. Italy, the USA, Sweden and Switzerland might be today the<br/>countries with the highest concentration of existing organs with split<br/>keys, while the development in other traditional organ countries like<br/>the Netherlands or Germany has not yet led to a more frequent re-use<br/>again.</p><p>Use</p><p>Though split keys could be used in several ways, transposition seems to<br/>be the most important reason for their existence. Transposition to a<br/>variety of intervals was frequent and necessary:  The organist had to<br/>provide the proper tones in the liturgy, to play transcriptions<br/>(intabulations) in different applied pitches and to accompany ensembles.</p><p>Special designs were developped, for example by apparently &quot;omitting&quot;<br/>certain keys, to enable comfortable transposition by certain intervals<br/>(reflecting probably the relative low or high organ pitch in the<br/>respective region). Designs in other organs lead to the conclusion that<br/>their split keys were used mainly in continuo-playing (Wolfenb&iuml;&iquest;&half;ttel, and<br/>maybe, Sciacca). Another organ (S&iuml;&iquest;&half;nderborg Slotskapel, 1626, rebuilt by<br/>B. (Zencker [?]) and restored recently by Mads Kjersgaard) even has two<br/>manuals, one of them with split keys, that shows some similarity to the<br/>concept of the so-called &iuml;&iquest;&half;transposing&quot; instruments by the German/Flemish<br/>harpsichord builders Ruckers.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/homepage.htm">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/homepage.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/public.html">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/ortgies/public.html</a></p><p>GOArt (G&iuml;&iquest;&half;teborg Organ Art center) G&iuml;&iquest;&half;teborgs universitet<br/><a href="http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/w-1.htm">http://www.hum.gu.se/goart/w-1.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=19482 href="#19482">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/27/2001 6:32:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Ibo Ortgies &lt;ibo.ortgies@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19479.html#19479">/tuning/topicId_19479.html#19479</a></p><p>Thank you, Mr. Ortgies for your interesting post...</p><p>&gt; Split keys in pythagorean tuning<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are hints provided by Christopher Stembridge and L.

Are you saying<br/>&gt; that the second chain of fifths above the first starts with an &quot;E&quot;<br/>&gt; that is a schisma away from a &quot;normal&quot; Pythagorean &quot;E?&quot;</p><p>Thanks, sorry. That needs clarification in my text:</p><p>The upper row are major thirds (384,4 cents) which are a schisma (1,9<br/>ct) lower than pure major thirds (386,3 ct).</p><p>&gt; I guess that must be, since,</p><p>&gt; otherwise the &quot;pure&quot; chain of<br/>&gt; Pythagorean fifth would create major thirds that are quite large,<br/>&gt; yes??  Quite a bit larger than just.</p><p>&gt; Is this correct??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________ ______ ______ ___<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>-------------</p><p>&gt;    Date: Tue, 27 Feb 2001 15:17:32 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:djwolf1@matavnet.hu">djwolf1@matavnet.hu</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Draft 1 FAQ:  Organs with split keys fewer than 19 per octave</p><p>&gt; Joseph Pehrson:</p><p>&gt; If you have a string of pythagorean fifths, reduced into a single<br/>&gt; octave, going four fifths upward, i.e. C-G-D-A-E will overshoot a 5:4<br/>&gt; pure major third by the syntonic comma (81/80, 21.5 cents; this is<br/>&gt; the interval that is distributed in MT). If, however, you go _down_ 8<br/>&gt; fifths C-F-Bb-Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-Cb-Fb, that diminished fourth will only<br/>&gt; differ from a pure 5:4 major third by the interval of the Skhisma<br/>&gt; (32805:32768, 1.954 cents). This is, for most (not all) musical<br/>&gt; purposes, negligible,</p><p>especially when we think of the possible &quot;pulling effects&quot; between organ<br/>pipes standing rathe close to each other (via air or/and via wind<br/>chest). this might lead to that an interval tuned close to pure will<br/>sound pure. Research on that is ongoing here in the Chalmers Technical<br/>University at the dept. of Technical acoustics (Prof. Mendel Kleiner).<br/>This &quot;pulling&quot; also seems to be relevant in practice, when talking about<br/>the &quot;bad&quot; 1/4-fifths in standard meantone, an impurity which diminuishes<br/>often when chords are heard.  Another aspect is that we find pipe flats<br/>where the pipes are ordered in major thirds, which stabilizes the tuning greatly.</p><p>&gt; and appears to have been widely used as a major<br/>&gt; third throughout Islamicate and medieval european music cultures.<br/>&gt; However, the convention that Fb:C approximates 5:4 was not accepted<br/>&gt; in European common practice music, rather the convention that E:C<br/>&gt; approximates 5:4, that is to say, the assumption underlying MT.</p><p>Maybe in my draft, there should be a link to this explanation on the<br/>pythagorean tuning-FAQ?<br/>Or rather a footnote (which I prefer to the benefit of the reader)</p><p>&gt; Daniel Wolf</p><p>&gt;    Date: Tue, 27 Feb 2001 15:47:11 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Draft 1 FAQ:  Organs with split keys fewer than 19 per octave</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., djwolf1@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_19479.html#19483">/tuning/topicId_19479.html#19483</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; Joseph Pehrson:</p><p>...<br/>&gt; Hello Daniel Wolf!</p><p>&gt; Thank you so VERY much for answering this &quot;riddle...&quot;  I guess, then,<br/>&gt; I was somewhat right when I asked whether the chain of fifths ABOVE<br/>&gt; the initial chain in Mr. Ortgies example started with an &quot;E&quot; that<br/>&gt; differed by a skhisma from the &quot;normal&quot; upward chain Pythagorean &quot;E.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Since it wasn&apos;t spelled Fb it was confusing to me.
