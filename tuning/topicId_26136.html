She was principal of a girls school in<br/>Bombay.  She studied vocal music there.  She described the difficulty of<br/>a woman studying music in India, sitting in front of gurus house waiting<br/>to be accepted etc.  She was a fabulous singer.  She taught a<br/>rudimentary class on Indian vocal music which I took.  We were also both<br/>enrolled in a graduate seminar together and it was in one of these where<br/>she talked about western tonal music in terms of its raga and tala.</p><p>As a member of an ethnomusicology seminar the information relayed is<br/>accepted at face value because everyone present is coming from a totally<br/>different culture.  We accepted what she was saying as one musical<br/>culture viewing another.</p><p>My head, at the time was into McCoy Tyner and George Adams and for some<br/>reason the music of McCoy Tyner and her views on western music went<br/>together.  I thought she would have loved this music except for the<br/>decibels.</p><p>Since I was a liaison and chauffeur at times I pondered what she might<br/>like in case the opportunity arose where I might take her to a concert<br/>etc.  But time was brief and I was getting out of ethnomusicology so a<br/>lot of things got left undone.  L.A. at the time (1972) had zero Indian<br/>culture so she was about as far away as you get from Indian culture.<br/>She was staying with a family in Westwood.</p><p>I&apos;m glad you&apos;re saying what you are saying because had she had the<br/>terminology she might have described western music differently.  The<br/>western music in question was a university choral concert she had just<br/>attended.  Could raga and tala describe this music?</p><p>Yours,<br/>Rick</p><p>Haresh BAKSHI wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Rick, Did the instructress of Indian music describe Western music<br/>&gt; in terms of raga?  I would like to know more about how she did it.  I<br/>&gt; believe that that is neither possible nor desirable.  And I do not<br/>&gt; think that it is possible  to analyze a Beethoven Symphony in terms<br/>&gt; of a raga.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; However, on reading your message, I thought it fit  to describe some<br/>&gt; rudiments of Western music in terms of Indian music. -- especially,<br/>&gt; raga-s.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p></div>
