When I first learned of the situation years ago I was bummed out about it, but now I&apos;m not because I think of the whole MIDI thing a different way. MIDI note numbers are just these 128 different kinds of events that can happen. They don&apos;t have to be different pitches or even musical notes at all, so they certainly don&apos;t have to be the standard 12edo pitches. Whatever&apos;s making the actual sound has to know the tuning information, but MIDI and MTS don&apos;t have to be involved at all.</p><p>The only downside of viewing it this way is that you can&apos;t have a standard MIDI file (SMF) with embedded tuning information. It&apos;s just a record of abstract events in time, rather than a self-contained description of music.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
