The numbers above the notes in this three voice<br/>setting show beats in a 3/4 or 3/8 measure. As in the medieval<br/>conductus, the melody is in the lowest part, with a bit of voice<br/>crossing. Note that the choice of notes &quot;D5/B4&quot; in the middle voice at<br/>the next to last measure means that D5 and/or B4 may be sung or<br/>played, with an option to &quot;divide&quot; the part and sing or play both<br/>notes if there are two or more people on this part, or on a keyboard.</p><p> 3  &amp;  | 1    2    3  | 1   2   3   &amp;  | 1    2  &amp;  3  | 1   2<br/>C5  C5   B4   C5   D5   E5      C5  C5   B4   C5 D5 E5   F5<br/>G4  G4   A4   G4   A4   B4      G4  G4   A4   G4    B4   C5<br/>C4  C4   D4   C4   F4   E4      C4  C4   D4   C4    G4   F4<br/>Hap-py Birth-day   to   you___, Hap-py  Birth-day   to   you___,</p><p> 3  &amp;  | 1    2    3  | 1   2    3   &amp;  | 1    2    3  | 1   2   3 ||<br/>C5  C5   G5   E5   C5   C5  D5   G5  G5   A5   F5   E5   F5<br/>G4  G4   F4   A4   G4   B4  A4   D5  D5   E5   C5  D5/B4 C5<br/>C4  C4   C5   A4   F4   E4  D4   Bb4 Bb4  A4   F4   G4   F4<br/>Hap-py  Birth-day, dear Kee-nan, Hap-py  Birth-day  to   you.</p><p>For the setting of your name, Keenan, a &quot;crunchy&quot; sonority seemed in<br/>order, thus E4-B4-C5 resolving to D4-A4-D5. While in the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot;<br/>tuning the outer minor sixth might be a bit less crunchy at ~11:7, the<br/>upper minor second should supply some strong &quot;crunchiness,&quot; maybe even<br/>more so at ~80 cents than in medieval Pythagorean (~90 cents).</p><p>As for that final cadence, in a three-part version I especially like<br/>G4-D5-E5 with its outgoing major second before F4-C5-F5, but also like<br/>G4-B4-E5 with the nice contrast to Bb in the previous measure. In<br/>medieval terms, maybe I picture two different manuscripts, one with<br/>each version. Additionally, as already mentioned, performers might<br/>&quot;have it both ways&quot; by the option of a four-voice texture for this<br/>cadence combining both alternatives, and featuring four directed<br/>resolutions of unstable intervals by stepwise contrary motion:</p><p>           E5 F5<br/>           D5 C5<br/>           B4 C5<br/>           G4 F4</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5 + m3-1 + M2-4)</p><p>Jon&apos;s original request was for a &quot;.MID file,&quot; which I guess might mean<br/>a MIDI file in some computer format. For anyone who might want to try<br/>such a project, here is a very unofficial SCALA file for a 12-note<br/>version of the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning.</p><p>----------------- Scala file begins next line of text ----------------</p><p>! kpnobl12.scl<br/>!<br/>Keenan Pepper&apos;s &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; with chromatic/diatonic semitone = Phi (12)<br/>12<br/>!<br/> 128.669246 cents<br/> 208.191213 cents<br/> 287.713180 cents<br/> 416.382426 cents<br/> 495.904393 cents<br/> 624.573639 cents<br/> 704.095607 cents<br/> 832.764852 cents<br/> 912.286820 cents<br/> 991.808787 cents<br/> 1120.478033 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>----------------- Scala file ends on previous line of text ------------</p><p>Anyway, Keenan, while this is a very quick arrangement, maybe it can<br/>give some idea of what neo-Gothic music is like, when performed in<br/>tunings ranging from Pythagorean to around 22-tET, including your<br/>Noble Fifth tuning as one prime candidate.</p><p>Again, Happy Birthday, with much joy (musical and otherwise) in the<br/>coming year.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=14927 href="#14927">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;mtpepper@prodigy.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2000 3:50:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think this is probably the best birthday present I am going to get. It<br/>really ties together the random stuff I&apos;ve learned about (neo-)gothic<br/>polyphony. The melody being on the bottom is really wierd, though I suppose<br/>there&apos;s really no reason for it to be on the top. It sounds wicked in a<br/>chorus voice on my synth. In Robert Walker&apos;s midi, why is one note of the<br/>penultimate chord in a different timbre?</p><p>Thanks sincerely,<br/>Keenan P.</p></div>
