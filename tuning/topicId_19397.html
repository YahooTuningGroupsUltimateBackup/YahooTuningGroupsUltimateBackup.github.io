I apologize for the delay, but hope that my early meantone<br/>FAQ draft may address some of the issues raised in recent posts as well as<br/>meet some general needs of newcomers.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m planning submissions on &quot;What is JI?&quot; and &quot;What is<br/>microtonality?&quot; -- which I maybe I can write better when I know that the<br/>paper is completed. Again, posts on these topics have given me some ideas.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
