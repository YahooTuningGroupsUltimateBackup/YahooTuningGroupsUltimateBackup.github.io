When<br/>you think about it, banning music is absolutely insane, as sound and<br/>vibration is the very frabric of the Universe. If the Taliban&apos;s<br/>treatment of women wasn&apos;t a bad enough horor, their hatred of music<br/>should be enough to convince anyone of the lunacy of the Taliban&apos;s<br/>interpretation of Islam...Hstick</p></div>
