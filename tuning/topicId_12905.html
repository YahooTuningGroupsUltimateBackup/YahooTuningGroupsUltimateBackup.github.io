(and Erlich ??) produce harmonic-subharmonic symmetrical results<br/>with harmonic-only hypothesis. Beating of harmonics in Helmholtz don&apos;t give<br/>asymmetric &quot;consonance basin&quot; nor really better &quot;computed consonance&quot; for<br/>given ratio compared to its inversion (difference between 4/3 and 3/2 is<br/>due, by example, to choice of reference octave : above unison).</p><p>At acoustical level, I don&apos;t deny that harmonic asymmetry is a necessity.<br/>Without that, there would be no periodicity and then no perceptible pitch<br/>with which are constructed intervals. At macrotonal level, however, it is<br/>clear that harmonic-subharmonic symmetry is perfect. Between them, at<br/>microtonal level, we have to be very critical vis-&agrave;-vis melting aspects of<br/>sonance question. Progress are&apos;nt easy with present degree of confusion.</p><p>I don&apos;t have time to deepen now. The following is only a remark. Although<br/>starting point seems harmonic series, according to your comments, I<br/>could&apos;nt find better example of dualism than your list of 34 tetrads ranked<br/>by harmonic entropy sum on six dyadic components. (Obviously, reason is in<br/>dyadic approach, but other ways are yet speculation).</p><p>Here, (a b c d) or (a b c d)* are chords. Sign _*_ indicate that values are<br/>subharmonics rather than harmonics. Chords (a b c d) and (d c b a)* are<br/>dual chords. Sign _SYM_ indicate that chord is identical with its dual.<br/>This symmetrical type of chord is clearly favoured here. Sign _ROT_<br/>indicate that tied tetrads are not only dual chords, but they have also<br/>symmetry by rotation.</p><p>I made correction at number 10 and added just ratios where missing except<br/>at number 19 which is irrelevant.</p><p>  1)  0-498-886-1384      9:12:15:20      (9 3 15 5) == (5 15 3 9)*   SYM</p><p>  2)  0-492-980-1472     12:16:21:28      (3 1 21 7) == (7 21 1 3)*   SYM</p><p>  3)  0-386-702-1088      8:10:12:15      (1 5 3 15) == (15 3 5 1)*   SYM</p><p>  4)  0-502-1002-1390     9:12:16:20       (9 3 1 5) == (5 15 45 9)*<br/>      0-388-888-1390     36:45:60:80     (9 45 15 5) == (5 1 3 9)*</p><p>  5)  0-306-702-1008     10:12:15:18      (5 3 15 9) == (9 15 3 5)*   SYM</p><p>  6)  0-204-702-1088       8:9:12:15      (1 9 3 15) == (45 5 15 3)*<br/>      0-386-884-1088     24:30:40:45     (3 15 5 45) == (15 3 9 1)*</p><p>  7)  0-388-886-1274     12:15:20:25     (3 15 5 25) == (25 5 15 3)*  SYM</p><p>  8)  0-268-702-970      12:14:18:21      (3 7 9 21) == (21 9 7 3)*   SYM</p><p>  9)  0-318-818-1320     15:18:24:32      (15 9 3 1) == (3 5 15 45)*<br/>      0-502-1002-1320    45:60:80:96     (45 15 5 3) == (1 3 9 15)*</p><p> 10)  0-388-702-886      12:15:18:20      (3 15 9 5) == (15 3 5 9)*   ROT<br/>      0-184-498-886       9:10:12:15      (9 5 3 15) == (5 9 15 3)*   ROT</p><p> 11)  0-434-820-1320     25:32:40:60     (25 1 15 5) == (1 25 5 15)*  ROT<br/>      0-500-886-1320     15:20:25:32     (15 5 25 1) == (5 15 1 25)*  ROT</p><p> 12)  0-302-502-1004     27:32:36:48      (27 1 9 3) == (1 27 3 9)*   ROT<br/>      0-502-702-1004     18:24:27:32      (9 3 27 1) == (3 9 1 27)*   ROT</p><p> 13)  0-318-816-1020         5:6:8:9       (5 3 1 9) == (9 15 45 5)*<br/>      0-204-702-1020     40:45:60:72     (5 45 15 9) == (9 1 5 3)*</p><p> 14)  0-498-888-1282     12:16:20:25      (3 1 5 25) == (25 75 15 3)*<br/>      0-394-784-1282    48:60:75:100    (3 15 75 25) == (25 5 1 3)*</p><p> 15)  0-384-588-1086    56:70:80:105    (7 35 5 105) == (15 3 21 1)*<br/>      0-498-702-1086     16:21:24:30     (1 21 3 15) == (105 5 35 7)*</p><p> 16)  0-500-816-1316     15:20:24:32      (15 5 3 1) == (1 5 3 15)*   SYM</p><p> 17)  0-388-776-1090     16:20:25:30     (1 5 25 15) == (75 15 3 5)*<br/>      0-314-702-1090     40:48:60:75     (5 3 15 75) == (15 25 5 1)*</p><p> 18)  0-498-702-886         6:8:9:10       (3 1 9 5) == (15 45 5 9)*<br/>      0-184-388-886      36:40:45:60     (9 5 45 15) == (5 9 1 3)*</p><p> 19)  0-442-884-1326                           (Cf. 442 stack)</p><p> 20)  0-186-576-888      18:20:25:30     (9 5 25 15) == (25 45 9 15)*<br/>      0-312-702-888      30:36:45:50    (15 9 45 25) == (15 25 5 9)*</p><p> 21)  0-388-702-970          4:5:6:7       (1 5 3 7) == (15 35 21 105)*<br/>      0-268-582-970     60:70:84:105  (15 35 21 105) == (7 3 5 1)*</p><p>These 34 tetrads are ranked now in accordance with internal structure<br/>rather than possible perceptibility.</p><p>  111-1   (1 3 5 7)      21a - 21b<br/>  121-1   (1 3 5 9)      4a - 4b - 13a - 13b - 18a - 18b<br/>  223-1   (1 3 5 15)     3 - 16<br/>  133-1   (1 3 9 15)     6a - 6b - 9a - 9b<br/>  123-3   (3 5 9 15)     1 - 5 - 10a - 10b<br/>  225-3   (1 3 7 21)     2<br/>  243-3   (3 7 9 21)     8<br/>  315-3   (1 3 15 21)    15a - 15b<br/>  145-5   (1 5 15 25)    11a - 11b - 17a - 17b<br/>  541-5   (3 5 15 25)    7<br/>  325-5   (5 9 15 25)    20a - 20b<br/>  441-7   (1 3 5 25)     14a - 14b<br/>  263-5   (1 3 9 27)     12a -12b<br/>  425-9   (3 5 13 31)    19 (nearest)</p><p>I use incremental generator value abc-d in first column for chords<br/>comparaison.

In the triangular case, this projection would essentially<br/>make the angles and lengths arbitary (well, one would determine the other)<br/>and so you can use whatever you like, so long as the basic structure of the<br/>lattices is preserved. For example, you could use your half-circle idea as a<br/>beginning for the triangular lattice, adding extra connections where<br/>necessary. For Tenney&apos;s idea, if you represented the octave as the interval<br/>at 0 degrees, with length proportional to log(2), and all the other primes<br/>with lengths proportional to log(p), the city-block distance metric Tenney<br/>proposed would come out right no matter what angles you chose in the<br/>&quot;projection&quot; down to 2-d -- so you could even use your half-circle idea.</p></div><h3><a id=13030 href="#13030">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I never<br/>hesitated in the past to write to scientists or mathematicians<br/>or their internet lists for help about lattices, prime numbers,<br/>spiders, etc., which all went into pre-compositional work for<br/>pieces, webpages, or commentary to this list.</p><p>My opinion is that it&apos;s not a good thing to break up this list<br/>by creating new ones UNLESS there is really a significantly big<br/>population with strong similar interests.  - I leave it to the<br/>reader to decide what scale to use to determine &apos;significance&apos; ;-)</p><p>I&apos;ve written here in the past celebrating the disparity of<br/>approach and vision exhibited by the subscribers on this list<br/>who post.  It may be impossible to resolve any clear superiority<br/>between a variety of perspective and a widespread narrow focus<br/>(which I see as opposite poles); in *both cases* the contributions<br/>posted create an exciting synergy between corresponents which<br/>results in a plethora of discovery, invention and creativity,<br/>and perhaps most importantly of all (as we&apos;ve just seen with the<br/>Schulter/Keenan paper), cooperation.</p><p>I say BRAVO! to the whole list!  A terrific example of a cyber-<br/>*community*!  (now if only we never had those lapses into<br/>flame-wars....)</p><p>But still the feeling nags away at me that variety of perspective<br/>should be encouraged at all costs.  The disparity of different<br/>opinions often creates factionism, with people siding with all<br/>different kinds of camps on various topics.  As long as the<br/>societal pressure to be civilized remains strong on the list,<br/>this is all good.  Woe to the day if the majority ever prefers<br/>to fan the flames - I&apos;ll be leaving then for sure.</p><p>I&apos;ve often been inspired to some of my best work, in compositions<br/>and webpages, by ideas catalyzed thru interaction on this list.</p><p>(Boy, I&apos;m really rambling tonight...)</p><p>On another subject:  I totally agree with Jon Szanto and Paul<br/>Erlich that really great compositions and composers can sound<br/>great in various diverse tunings.</p><p>(OK, back to the original thread...)</p><p>&gt; ... I think ultimately, though, a simple Voronoi cell approach,<br/>&gt; or some clever modification of it, will be good enough . . .</p><p>Yes, Paul, my intution tells me that you&apos;re definitely on the<br/>right track with this.  I&apos;ve examined your Voronoi diagram and<br/>like it a lot.  I&apos;d be happy to help you scheme up some<br/>&apos;clever modification of it&apos;...  (my guess is that consultations<br/>with Herbert would be especially beneficial here!)</p><p>I have some programming skills in VB if that can help your<br/>harmonic entropy research, and am willing to make MIDI-files<br/>of audio examples that John Starrett or Joe Pehrson would<br/>probably be happy to turn into mp3.</p><p>I get more and more excited about the sense of collaborative<br/>research and creativity evolving here!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
