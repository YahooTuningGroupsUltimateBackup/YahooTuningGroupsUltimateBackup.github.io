I think in a LOT of cases, the use of two or more<br/>&quot;manuals&quot; is too big an advantage to ignore.</p><p>&gt; An obvious advantage of two keyboards with a polyphonic and<br/>&gt; polytimbral synthesizer such as the TX802 -- one that can produce not<br/>&gt; only many voices but multiple timbres or &quot;instruments&quot; at the same<br/>&gt; time -- is that one can map different &quot;instruments&quot; to each keyboard,<br/>&gt; getting the same kind of effect as a two-manual organ.

Assuming you can keep the channel assignments<br/>separate, nothing stopping you from running one TX802 (or any MIDI<br/>synthesizer) per keyboard to keep the polyphony limits &quot;isolated&quot;. If one<br/>part were to exceed the limit, it would not affect the other playing parts.<br/>A more expensive solution, but in my opinion, the most desireable.</p><p>&gt; What is an occasional complication for early European music (where<br/>&gt; &quot;one instrument per part&quot; is often the most attractive solution) might<br/>&gt; be a major disappointment for someone seeking in live performance to<br/>&gt; emulate Romantic organ registrations or orchestral sonorities, for<br/>&gt; example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The second advantage of two keyboards for the TX802 may be of special<br/>&gt; interest to some alternative tuning people: the possibility of using<br/>&gt; the &quot;part-tuning&quot; feature to map a tuning such as 17-note equal<br/>&gt; temperament (17-tet) into two 12-note repeating patterns, e.g.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Db  D#     Gb  Ab   A#<br/>&gt; Keyboard 2: C   D   E  F   G   A   B  C<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------<br/>&gt; C#  Eb     F#  G# Bb<br/>&gt; Keyboard 1: C   D   E  F   G   A   B  C<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes! I was thinking of something very much on this note the other day<br/>myself. See the &quot;Monolith&quot; link below, this is yet another reason I think<br/>this may be a solution if it ever comes of &quot;fruitation&quot; so to speak.</p><p>&gt; This is only one possible solution: for 17-tet, one could also map the<br/>&gt; five flats to one keyboard and the five sharps to the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, the TX802 also permits one to map 17-tet to a single<br/>&gt; keyboard in linear fashion, with octaves repeating every 17 notes<br/>&gt; instead of 12.

A lot of what<br/>would have been really wicked microtonal machines ended up being impeded by<br/>the octave-scaling limitation (e.g. Kurzweil K150), but with your idea, this<br/>obviously wouldn&apos;t really pose a big problem as you said.</p><p>&gt;&gt; From one perspective, this kind of &quot;part-tuning&quot; solution is itself a<br/>&gt; kind of kludge: wouldn&apos;t keyboards with more than 12 notes per octave,<br/>&gt; for example with split accidentals in the Renaissance fashion, be a<br/>&gt; more efficient solution?

In short, I think that perhaps the Monolith would make<br/>&gt; an excellent &quot;bridge&quot; product, that perhaps would ultimately lead up to more<br/>&gt; extravagant and tonally interesting instruments such as the MicroZone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you think?</p><p>Unfortunately, as we all know the Monolith is not available now and who knows<br/>how long you will have to wait?

Yes, it looks pretty good, although there<br/>are things the DSPs can&apos;t cope with.  I&apos;m still working through the<br/>tutorial, so I don&apos;t know how this affects high-level synthesis.  That&apos;s<br/>the only thing relevant for comparison to the Kurzweil, isn&apos;t it, how well<br/>it works as a synth?</p><p>For live work, you can probably get it so the sound quality&apos;s as good as<br/>the PA, assuming you&apos;ve got the same budget for both.  And maybe some<br/>external effects as well.  For studio work, you don&apos;t have to do<br/>everything in real time.  4 channel sound is good enough for a<br/>synthesizer, but not a mixing desk.</p><p>Probably, the difference is that a &quot;normal&quot; synthesizer will have a load<br/>of presets, to give you the popular instruments.  Whereas with Kyma,<br/>everything has to be programmed at low-level.  The average musician would<br/>probably prefer a plug-and-pray type solution, and not appreciate being<br/>told to get a complex system like Kyma.</p><p>But I&apos;m sure most retunable synths could be coerced to work with these<br/>multi-channel keyboards, provided you only want to play each synth<br/>single-timbrally (so you don&apos;t run out of channels).  If the automatic<br/>channel allocation isn&apos;t convenient, it should be easy to get a Windows PC<br/>to convert it all.  Unfortunately, in reality, Windows programs tend to<br/>crash if you do anything unusual with them, and sometimes if you don&apos;t, so<br/>they aren&apos;t so easy to write.  You also tend to get locked into libraries<br/>that don&apos;t work with newer compilers.  But such a program is certainly<br/>possible.</p><p>Where was I?</p><p>Oh yes, I expect the idea is that if you&apos;re spending a small fortune on a<br/>keyboard you may as well spend a slightly larger one on a good synthesizer<br/>as well.  Not that a cheaper synth won&apos;t work at all.</p><p>I thought those ZTars looked good.  They solve the poseability problem of<br/>keyboards.
