I notice<br/>&gt; from these Euler translations that have appeared on the web<br/>&gt; (sorry, don&apos;t have the URLs, look back a few digests) that he<br/>&gt; seemed to have the same idea.</p><p>My English translation of Patrice Bailhache&apos;s<br/>_Music as Mathematics: Leonhard Euler_ is at:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a></p><p>Glad you mentioned it, because I&apos;ve just added Professor Bailhache&apos;s<br/>final corrections.</p><p>(except for one misplaced email... that&apos;s why I haven&apos;t said<br/>anything about it yet...)</p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>[David Beardsley, TD 182.6]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe there should be a Rite of Spring for one hand piano?<br/>&gt; Wagner for rubber band?</p><p>I really need to dig out that _Plunderphonic_ URL.<br/>Do a search on Altavista if you&apos;re really interested in<br/>hearing wild stuff like this.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Ray Tomes, TD 182.12]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The interesting thing about 4D space (or 6D with 11 and 13) is<br/>&gt; that there is a lot of it.  Although most music drifts around<br/>&gt; quite a lot on the 2 and 3 axes it doesn&apos;t seem to on the<br/>&gt; 5 and 7 axes and these axes seem to have just a couple of<br/>&gt; notches rather than the full range getting used.  That is why I<br/>&gt; think there is some room for inventiveness.  However this is<br/>&gt; actually in the composing side rather than the tuning side.</p><p>I submitted a posting about this interesting idea a couple of<br/>months ago, calling modulation along the 3 and 5 axes (the<br/>kind we&apos;re used to hearing or implying) &apos;lateral modulation&apos;<br/>and modulation along the 7 and 11 (and higher?) axes &apos;vertical<br/>modulation&apos;.</p><p>The terminology is loosely based on tonal lattice diagrams,<br/>since the 3 x 5 axes form a grid.</p><p>I&apos;ve noted also in my book that older concepts of tonal<br/>expansion were based on a lateral or horizontal expansion<br/>of pitch resources, while La Monte Young is perhaps the<br/>foremost explorer of the vertical expansion (using whole<br/>groups of primes into the 200s).</p><p>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Alex van Wey, TD 182.14]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The silly thing about email is that a sly and funny remark<br/>&gt; looks identical to a snide and sarcastic one.</p><p>Once again I&apos;d like to invoke Carl Lumma&apos;s great term for that:</p><p>[Carl Lumma]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the lack-of-tone-in-speech email bug</p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>[Kraig Grady, TD 182.17, re: Kronos _Barstow_ transcription]</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Briefly we&apos;re here, then we&apos;re gone!-Partch</p><p>Touche&apos;!</p><p>Awesome rebuttal Kraig - what else can I say?</p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p>[Dave Beardsley, TD 182.23]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; one thing that has always bugged me about classical practice is<br/>&gt; that wide vibrato.<br/>&gt; Particularly vocalists.</p><p>I&apos;ve always hated the extremely wide operatic vibrato.</p><p>I&apos;ve also found out from listening to some ancient recordings<br/>of opera singers that the application of this style and the<br/>range of vibrato has increased dramatically during the 20th<br/>century.</p><p>Mary Garden was praised by just about everyone around the<br/>turn of the last century as the greatest opera vocalist around,<br/>and I was stunned when I first heard her on a radio program.<br/>There was hardly any vibrato in her style at all.<br/>And I liked it too, especially for drama.</p><p>Same goes for Caruso, but the difference is remarkably noticeable<br/>with Mary Garden.</p><p>-------------------------------</p><p>[Ray Tomes, TD 182.25]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; how do I get individual messages and still know the references?</p><p>The easiest way would be to subscribe again, this time<br/>in Digest format, and just receive both versions each day.</p><p>Perhaps this would have to be on another account?</p><p>Mark Nowitzky would have to tell you if you can have two<br/>subscriptions on the same account, or just try it and see what<br/>happens.</p><p>[Ray]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am quite delighted by how many people are thinking along<br/>&gt; lines that are similar to mine.  Over the previous decade I<br/>&gt; have found few people that understood what I was saying let<br/>&gt; alone other people thinking some similar thoughts.</p><p>I know exactly what you mean.</p><p>Many times here I&apos;ve talked about how for so many years as<br/>I worked in isolation, I thought I&apos;d &apos;invented&apos; lattice diagrams<br/>and lots of other aspects of my theory.</p><p>Getting on the Tuning List has shown me that work like this<br/>has been done before, and it&apos;s a delight to be able to argue<br/>aspects of it with others who know all about it.</p><p>[Ray]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I want to know whether this is considered a public forum<br/>&gt; (I would think so) and I can therefore quote material in this<br/>&gt; manner, or whether it is necessary to ask first.</p><p>I don&apos;t recall this specific question being asked before,<br/>but I&apos;ve asked publicly like this about quoting email addresses<br/>on my website, and assumed the postings as public, considering<br/>them to be published material once it&apos;s been sent out.</p><p>But it&apos;s always a nice courtesy to ask first  :)</p><p>Joseph L.
