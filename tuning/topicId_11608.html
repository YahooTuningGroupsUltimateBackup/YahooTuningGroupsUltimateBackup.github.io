If I correctly understand the distinctions you were making in<br/>&gt;our recent exchanges, the word &quot;discordance&quot; would be more appropriate<br/>&gt;here.  Or am I missing something?</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely right, John. I&apos;d like to try to correct my usage, so<br/>please alert me if I slip up again. More specifically, though, I pointed the<br/>distinction out to you because it is one used by Easley Blackwood, who, like<br/>you, operates from withing the constructs of Western tonality, and to whom<br/>the dominant seventh chord is always dissonant, though when tuned 4:5:6:7,<br/>is not discordant. I like a more fluid definition of dissonance in which the<br/>odd limit is not necessarily fixed at 5 but is determined by the particular<br/>style/composer/piece in question. Still, you are right.</p></div>
