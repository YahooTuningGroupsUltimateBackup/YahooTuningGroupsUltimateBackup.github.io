The first notation might suggest his concept that this<br/>intermediate third tends toward the major third at 5:4, something<br/>which he sees as giving it a relatively concordant quality.</p><p>Similarly, while his description of the &quot;proximate major third&quot; as<br/>having a ratio of approximately 4-1/2:3-1/2 could have written this<br/>ratio as 9:7, the fractional form might express his viewpoint that it<br/>tends toward the fourth (4:3), in this case, for him, taking on a<br/>quality tending somewhat toward dissonance. While regarding the fourth<br/>as a perfect concord (as does Zarlino in his treatise of three years<br/>later), he evidently sees it as having some &quot;mixed&quot; qualities, in<br/>contrast to the concord of the major third toward which the<br/>5-1/2:4-1/2 tends.</p><p>In fairness to Barbour and Isacoff, I would add that interpreting<br/>Vicentino is indeed a process of _interpretation_: while I like the<br/>idea of the &quot;comma keys&quot; in Vicentino&apos;s first tuning providing a few<br/>JI fifths and sonorities of the kind generally available in his second<br/>tuning, that is indeed an educated (I hope) interpretation rather than<br/>_the_ obvious and correct reading.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
