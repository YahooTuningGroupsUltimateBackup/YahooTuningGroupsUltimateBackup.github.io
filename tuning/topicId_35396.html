Erv is sending it in the mail tomorrow<br/>morning (Even though we live 2 miles apart, sometimes this is really the fastest way:-)) I will put up the corrected version as soon as i get it. This will take care<br/>of the 7/6 and 19/16 being on the same place also as the latter was penciled in as he was working on the scale . I was correct in seeing them as alternates of each<br/>other.<br/> As to the 4/3 having two different sized , Erv has stated this is a result of neglecting the Skisma and such things can also be seen in Basic Patterns underling 12<br/>and 17<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/genus.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/genus.PDF</a> .<br/>The difference between the pythagorean aug. 4 and the JI dim. fifth thought of as the same interval<br/>he also stated that this scale has evolved over quite a period of time and illustrates that he does not always follow hard and fast rules and allows his own musical<br/>inclination dictate what and when he uses what he does use.</p><p>paulerlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 4<br/>&gt;    Date: Fri, 08 Mar 2002 22:53:12 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: warning on evangelina<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; just thought i&apos;d forward this comment from gene:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning-math@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; how about an evangelina example: 19-limit, 22-tone where 1216:1215<br/>&gt; &gt; and 57:56 are unison vectors?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a bizarre request--1216/1215 comes out a comma if you map<br/>&gt; 19 to 94, and 57/56 if you map 19 to 93. To get them both to be<br/>&gt; commas, you need to screw the mapping of 7.<br/>&gt; --- End forwarded message ---<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the shocking implication is that, unlike the vast majority of<br/>&gt; wilson&apos;s scales, evangelina is not a constant structure scale. this<br/>&gt; is seen immediately in that the interval from 135/128 to 45/32, which<br/>&gt; is 4:3, is 10 steps in the tuning, while the interval from 1/1 to<br/>&gt; 4/3, also 4:3, is 9 steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; does kraig have any comment?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
