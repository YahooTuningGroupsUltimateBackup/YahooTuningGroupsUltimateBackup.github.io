It is said that the organ was a marvel of<br/>technology with figurines dancing at certain hours of the day. Dallam was<br/>expected to perform on the instrument, thus he practiced day and night with<br/>a clavichord while on board the ship en-route to Istanbul. On arrival, he<br/>noticed, much to his dismay, that the pipes were crushed and malformed<br/>during the voyage. For months, he labored to repair them, and finally<br/>managed to install the machine in a kiosk by the Topkapi palace.</p><p>I have read that he was admitted to a hidden portion of the Sultan&apos;s harem<br/>while working on the organ, was dazed by the splendour and riches, and was<br/>scared like hell when it was told him that the Sultan and the royal cortege<br/>was visiting and that he should run for his life. Eventually, he was caught<br/>while trying to escape, begged for his life, and was spared, by luck more<br/>than his wits I might add.</p><p>He did perform for the sultan on this instrument it seems, and in cold sweat<br/>as muscular black servants with scimitars in their hands clustered around<br/>his &grave;royal highness&grave; who sat inches away from him. He tells us that he could<br/>not remember how he finished the piece, but that it was liked by his<br/>&grave;excellency&grave;.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was instructed to remove the instrument to some other<br/>place. The fate of the machine is saddening. It was burned and destroyed<br/>during the reign of Murad IV on grounds that music (especially by the<br/>Western infidel) was forbidden.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 20 Aral&iuml;&iquest;&half;k 2005 Sal&iuml;&iquest;&half; 2:58<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: enharmonics of different pitches (MMM: people&apos;s<br/>perception of &quot;microtonality&quot;)</p><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think England was the leading producer of keyboard instruments<br/>&gt; for a<br/>&gt; &gt; lot of this time.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Clark<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most keyboard instruments would either be tuned in the destination<br/>&gt; country (pianos, harpsichords) or would be too big and heavy to ever<br/>&gt; leave the origin country in the first place (pipe organs).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
