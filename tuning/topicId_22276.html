I do appreciate being<br/>asked.</p><p>To date I haven&apos;t been involved in the coding for it at all. If there<br/>is something that you would like the code for, say, conversion of<br/>cents to ratios or whatever, then I am happy to share some of the<br/>c-code from FTS (indeed, you could use the source code from my<br/>javascript pages for that particular one).</p><p>But, not at all interested in debugging someone elses code, at least, not for<br/>a large complex application, which is what would inevitably be involved if<br/>I were to take on the completion of the project from the present source code. I&apos;m<br/>happy to help beginner programmers find bugs in their programs, but that<br/>is quite another matter. Just from trying out the program, I see it is<br/>well designed, by expert programmers who know what they are about, and they should<br/>be able to fix their own bugs!</p><p>For many projects, debugging is about half of the work; maybe less if one<br/>uses really good programming practices (I&apos;d say less than half would be<br/>rather rare), maybe much more, especially if it isn&apos;t so well written,<br/>or the bugs are particularly elusive.</p><p>It is hard enough to find bugs in ones own program<br/>that one practically knows some of the sections by heart line by line from debugging it.</p><p>This program isn&apos;t even in the language I normally use as it is in C++ rather<br/>than C.</p><p>I expect you aren&apos;t that aware of those points as you are not so involved<br/>in programming large programs.</p><p>See if you can get the original programmers enthusiastic about it again.<br/>It is a nice program with a lot of potential, so I think there is a<br/>lot to be enthusiastic about in it, if you don&apos;t try to do too much<br/>at once.</p><p>Also, releasing the program and getting nice feedback from users is a way<br/>to encourage the programmers to continue. But, you do have to fix bugs<br/>first. Better to have a simple program that works than one with lots of<br/>great features that doesn&apos;t.</p><p>Especially, it _must_ work for any input for the basic task the program<br/>is designed to do - if a user happens to open a scale that doesn&apos;t show<br/>up a lattice at all first time they use the program, unless very determined,<br/>they will just give up at that point.</p><p>I wish I could debug all the buggy nice programs in the world. But, not<br/>practical,...</p><p>I believe it is fairly common for a program to get very close to completion<br/>and never be completed because of bugs that are never fixed.</p><p>I make a policy of fixing all the bugs I find. However, if that isn&apos;t<br/>practical, one can prioritise them.</p><p>For example, a bug that means a user can&apos;t open a scale and show a lattice<br/>is top priority as the program can&apos;t be used at all until it is fixed.</p><p>An example of a low priority bug might be - you write a word processing<br/>program, and very occasionally the printer will print out an extra blank<br/>page at the end of a document. Okay, should be fixed, but it isn&apos;t that<br/>much trouble for the user to put the blank page back into the feeder<br/>tray, so it is a low priority bug (I got this example from a book on<br/>coding practice and debugging, but I think it is a good one).</p><p>I don&apos;t think it would take that long for the original programmers to<br/>fix the top priority bugs. Also it is perfectly normal for a program<br/>to have such things at the beta stage, and doesn&apos;t reflect badly on<br/>the programmers at all. What does reflect badly is if it is released<br/>when it is still at that early beta stage, so they do have to be fixed!</p><p>I&apos;d say go for an early release, let some of the others on the<br/>TL use it, and see what they say, and go from there.</p><p>But that is only a suggestion, I hasten to add!</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Monday, May 07, 2001 10:03 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 1289</p><p>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

In Xenharmonikon 17, John Chalmers published a list of all<br/>&gt; superparticular ratios for each prime limit through (I think) 23, using a maximum of something<br/>like<br/>&gt; 10 digit numbers.

I also<br/>&gt; spent some time implementing the upsampling and downsampling options.<br/>&gt; These allow me to make miniature pianos and giant piccolos.

Might save people like Paul some time, too!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it would save Paul time, because even tho the version<br/>&gt; that currently works only uses the Monzo lattice formula,<br/>&gt; eventually the plan is to have the user specify any lattice<br/>&gt; formula he wishes, including all of Erv Wilson&apos;s lattice<br/>&gt; and Bosanquet-derived keyboard designs.  So Paul could<br/>&gt; simply pop in the numbers, or better yet, formulae, and<br/>&gt; JustMusic does all the latticing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And of course, the ultimate goal of JustMusic is to produce<br/>&gt; audible music.  The version I have that will actually create<br/>&gt; music for me does it with MIDI, but we&apos;ve put that on the<br/>&gt; back burner and have decided to create CSound output.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But anyway, the project has been stalled for a while as<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t had time to devote to its leadership.

Its easy to<br/>&gt; create a little function that puts whatever ratios, or temperaments desired<br/>&gt; into patterns. you could for example set a ton of material into a variable<br/>&gt; and then later manipulate that pattern, meaning pattern of ratios to a<br/>&gt; fundamental or frequencies in general, and modulate it or whatever you want<br/>&gt; by whatever ratio or number you want with very little code. Of course this<br/>&gt; all depends on how specific you want to be with everything<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or you can work in scale degrees or other ways I havent messed with much. It<br/>&gt; does have a feature that can do lists of notes which I&apos;ve used briefly but I<br/>&gt; always tend to make a mistake here or there (wrong duration for a note or<br/>&gt; what not which screws everything up). Everything you specify, unless you are<br/>&gt; specifically using lists of notes, can of course be specified of course but<br/>&gt; you definately dont have to specify it for every note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wish it was supported on PC. I am more of a PC guy myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for the info on how you work with the microtones, interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andy<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [This message contained attachments]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 19<br/>&gt;    Date: Sun, 6 May 2001 22:56:33 -0700 (PDT)<br/>&gt;    From: mschulter &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Pythagorean 3-speed bikes -- Monz&apos;s welcome emendation<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, Monz, and thank you very much both for a most due<br/>&gt; Aristoxenian &quot;friendly amendment&quot; to my post on 3-speed Pythagorean<br/>&gt; bikes, and a fascinating discussion on &quot;least intervals.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I would very much like to emphasize the importance of your<br/>&gt; point about choosing an interval varying somewhat from 7:6 _by ear_<br/>&gt; for your composition _3+4_, and then, having settled on something<br/>&gt; around 279 cents, selecting 75:64 as a convenient ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, although I had read your account, my language neglects<br/>&gt; this very characteristic Aristoxenian touch -- finding what sounds<br/>&gt; right, and then integrating it into the intonational structure. My<br/>&gt; emphasis was on &quot;How neat that this fits a 5-limit RI model!&quot; as if<br/>&gt; the model were the basis for the choice, rather than the ratio a<br/>&gt; convenient realization of an _aural_ judgment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In contrast, my tricomma tuning was a theoretical construct designed<br/>&gt; to solve a musical problem on a mathematical basis: &quot;Come up with a<br/>&gt; 24-note Pythagorean tuning with both a 7-flavor and a 17-flavor.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your experimental, directly interactive, &quot;intracompositional&quot; process<br/>&gt; of trying 7:6, adjusting by ear to 279 cents, and then fine-tuning to<br/>&gt; a 75:64 as a ratio at once satisfying to the ear and conceptually<br/>&gt; elegant, is something left out of my narrative -- which could easily<br/>&gt; be read to suggest that you set out in advance to emulate a 7-based<br/>&gt; ratio with a complex 5-limit approximation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In any future reference to the 75:64 saga, I&apos;ll be careful to tell the<br/>&gt; full story, with much emphasis on the very audible process of<br/>&gt; &quot;fine-tuning&quot; in the best Aristoxenian manner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for small intervals, or more specifically those with not-so-small<br/>&gt; integer ratios, the monzisma at ~0.29 cents is larger than the kalisma,<br/>&gt; the difference between 32:25 and the 12544:9801 interval equal to a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean major third at 81:64 plus two 896:891 commas (the<br/>&gt; difference between this third and 14:11). The kalisma has a ratio of<br/>&gt; 9801:9800, or ~0.1766 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, I wonder what might have happened had you chosen a<br/>&gt; different rational expression for your &quot;right-sounding&quot; 279 cents, for<br/>&gt; example 27:23 (~277.59 cents)? That ratio occurred to me by a certain<br/>&gt; free association as the fifth complement of the 23:18 which I enjoy<br/>&gt; quoting as an RI approximation for the regular major third of 17-tET<br/>&gt; -- that is, the size that the minor third _would_ have in 17-tET if<br/>&gt; the fifths were a pure 3:2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The jots are interesting -- according to Scala, a kalisma at 9801:9800<br/>&gt; is about 4.431350 jots; although the monzisma apparently involves a<br/>&gt; rational ratio too large for my version of Scala for MS-DOS to report<br/>&gt; in integer form, it returns a size of about 7.334990 jots.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 20<br/>&gt;    Date: Sun, 6 May 2001 22:59:14 -0700 (PDT)<br/>&gt;    From: mschulter &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Ben Johnston notation - a centered universe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            ------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;              Ben Johnston notation and historical context:<br/>&gt;            A response to the Paul Erlich-Kyle Gann dialogue<br/>&gt;            ------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, and having become something of a topic as well as a not<br/>&gt; disinterested reader of the fascinating dialogue regarding matters of<br/>&gt; broad music history and notational utility involving Paul Erlich and<br/>&gt; Kyle Gann, I would like to respond especially on two questions of<br/>&gt; historical style and intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me begin by thanking Paul Erlich warmly for quoting my<br/>&gt; views pertinently and accurately, and also Kyle Gann for raising some<br/>&gt; very reasonable questions and differences of view with a widespread<br/>&gt; currency among musicologists and others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 1. General concerns: 5-limit notations and historical transitions<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before getting into the deeper historical intricacies of 14th-century<br/>&gt; style and Pythagorean intonation (e.g. Machaut), or the fluid and<br/>&gt; often ambiguous modality of the late 16th and early 17th centuries<br/>&gt; based in my view mainly on a meantone model, I&apos;d like briefly to<br/>&gt; address the primary matter at issue in this dialogue, and also to echo<br/>&gt; your caution, Kyle Gann, about taking _any_ convenient date as a<br/>&gt; precise and absolute line or demarcation between two eras or<br/>&gt; approaches such as modality and major/minor tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 1.1. Notational projects and historical precedent<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, regarding notations for a system such as 5-limit just<br/>&gt; intonation (JI) where any solution will involve some compromises and<br/>&gt; arguable &quot;anomalies,&quot; I would say pragmatically that whatever people<br/>&gt; find most comfortable and convenient is best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since different people evidently find different notations most<br/>&gt; &quot;natural,&quot; some diversity may be the most reasonable or, I might say,<br/>&gt; &quot;ecologically&quot; appropriate solution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we are to take 16th-century musical notation as a precedent or<br/>&gt; model, however, then we encounter a complication: this notation, as<br/>&gt; used by composers and theorists including Zarlino (champion of the<br/>&gt; syntonic diatonic as a model of _vocal_ intonation), does not attempt<br/>&gt; explicitly to show syntonic comma adjustments or to distinguish 9:8<br/>&gt; and 10:9 whole-tones. Rather such adjustments -- however negotiated --<br/>&gt; are left implicitly to the performers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing a 16th-century piece on a keyboard with a 15-note octave<br/>&gt; modelled after Zarlino&apos;s scheme, I must realize the notation by<br/>&gt; playing the right notes to make either G-D or D-A a pure fifth rather<br/>&gt; than one a syntonic comma narrow. Here there is _not_ a one-to-one<br/>&gt; correspondence between notation or spelling and the tuning system<br/>&gt; itself. Karol Berger&apos;s dissertation on chromatic and enharmonic<br/>&gt; theories in late 16th-century Italy nicely addresses this point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus the project of developing a 5-limit notation which _expressly_<br/>&gt; indicates syntonic comma distinctions is something outside of usual<br/>&gt; 16th-century practice, which seems to me most closely to reflect<br/>&gt; either meantone or some &quot;unwritten&quot; form of adaptive tuning<br/>&gt; adjustments for purer consonances. On this point, Paul, we seem much<br/>&gt; in agreement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As to what system is best for such a project, I may not be the best or<br/>&gt; most informed judge, since I&apos;m accustomed mostly to what I term<br/>&gt; &quot;equitonal&quot; systems such as Pythagorean intonation, meantone, and<br/>&gt; neo-Gothic temperaments where all regular major seconds have the same<br/>&gt; size and a major third is equal to four fifths up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one is seeking a literal notation for classic 5-limit JI which<br/>&gt; keeps count of all the syntonic commas, then I might personally go<br/>&gt; with the Helmholz-Ellis-Wolf-Monzo system (HEWM), also used by Easley<br/>&gt; Blackwood (albeit as a critic rather than an exponent of this form of<br/>&gt; intonation).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, if the Ben Johnston notation is comfortable for performers<br/>&gt; and helps them find the right notes, then that&apos;s fine, also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I would emphasize that neither Johnston nor HEWM notation needs<br/>&gt; the ratification of any historical precedent: if the notational shoe<br/>&gt; fits the musical foot, then why not wear it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 1.2. Transitions and conventional dates<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In response to Paul&apos;s accurate quote of my view that the transition<br/>&gt; from modality to major/minor tonality had become an established<br/>&gt; feature of &quot;modern&quot; practice by around 1680 (the era of Corelli and<br/>&gt; Werckmeister), Kyle questions the validity of giving _any_ precise<br/>&gt; date for such a transition, as well as proposing the late 16th-century<br/>&gt; era of Palestrina, say a century earlier, as a better estimate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While saving the issue of modality in the late 16th and early 17th<br/>&gt; centuries for discussion below (Section 3), I would like very much to<br/>&gt; agree that any date such as 1680 is merely an arbitrary reference<br/>&gt; point for a process of transition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What we have during the Manneristic era of around 1540-1640 or<br/>&gt; Rore-Monteverdi, in my viewpoint, is a fluid and very creative<br/>&gt; practice based on a 12-mode system both enriched and sometimes blurred<br/>&gt; by liberties including direct chromaticism and sometimes also<br/>&gt; diesisism (Vicentino). An important point is that the new inflections<br/>&gt; often fit _neither_ the &quot;classical&quot; Renaissance practice of a composer<br/>&gt; such as Josquin, nor the constraints of major/minor tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the third quarter of the 17th century, composers such as Stradella<br/>&gt; are moving in a tonal direction, so that one might place the<br/>&gt; transition somewhere around 1660-1680, with Corelli&apos;s music taken as a<br/>&gt; confirmation and consolidation of this trend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One advantage of the approximate date 1680 is that it closely<br/>&gt; coincides with Werckmeister&apos;s publication of his well-temperaments<br/>&gt; (1681 and later), as well his views that only two basic modes (major<br/>&gt; and minor) were needed to describe modern practice. At the same time,<br/>&gt; this date also agrees with one 20th-century view of the major/minor<br/>&gt; period as ranging roughly from 1680 to 1900 (say Corelli-Puccini).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my opinion, a balanced view of the problem should recognize not<br/>&gt; only that some elements introduced in the late modal practice of<br/>&gt; around 1600-1640 become usual elements of major/minor tonality, but<br/>&gt; also that some modal concepts remain important in the theory of around<br/>&gt; 1700, when we would agree that tonality has clearly become the norm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, to propose (as Mark Lindley does, very reasonably in my<br/>&gt; view) that the transition from Pythagorean to meantone on keyboards<br/>&gt; may have occurred sometime around 1450 is not to say that it happened<br/>&gt; suddenly in that precise year or even decade, but that clues such as<br/>&gt; the style of a keyboard composer such as Conrad Paumann suggest this<br/>&gt; epoch as a likely one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Traditional &quot;great dates&quot; of historiography may be placed in fuller<br/>&gt; perspective without losing their significance. The year 1600 (or its<br/>&gt; surrounding decade or so), for example, continues to symbolize the<br/>&gt; import of such events as the new dissonance treatment of Monteverdi<br/>&gt; and his colleagues, or the advent of continuo-based forms, even if we<br/>&gt; choose to describe this transition as &quot;Early/Late Manneristic&quot; rather<br/>&gt; than &quot;Renaissance/Baroque.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To sum up, Kyle, I&apos;m much in agreement with you that any quoted date<br/>&gt; for a transition between two musical eras, styles, or tuning systems<br/>&gt; is at best a convention and convenience -- although a galvanizing<br/>&gt; composition or treatise may often provide a ready date _symbolizing_<br/>&gt; such a transition and making its flavor more tangible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 2. Pythagorean intonation and the 14th century<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this dialogue, Machaut&apos;s prominent use of major thirds was briefly<br/>&gt; mentioned, and I&apos;d like to comment in my view that this practice is<br/>&gt; quite consistent with the Pythagorean intonation described by<br/>&gt; musicians of the Ars Nova era such as his contemporary Johannes Boen<br/>&gt; (1357).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As long as thirds and sixths are treated as decidedly _unstable_<br/>&gt; intervals, often inviting standard cadential resolutions although<br/>&gt; often also used in a freer or more &quot;coloristic&quot; fashion, Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning fits such a role of &quot;imperfect concord&quot; or _relative_ blend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An interesting passage in Boen explains the role of parallel thirds<br/>&gt; and sixths in approaching a cadence: these intervals serve as<br/>&gt; &quot;forerunners and handmaidens&quot; of the stable or &quot;perfect&quot; concords of<br/>&gt; the fifth and octave. Thus I find that a late Gothic idiom of this<br/>&gt; kind can be very pleasing in Pythagorean tuning, with C4 here showing<br/>&gt; middle C in a &quot;MIDI-like&quot; fashion:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A4 G4  F4 E4 F4<br/>&gt; E4 D4  C4 B3 C4<br/>&gt; C4 Bb3 A3 G3 F3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Mark Lindley writes, the complex thirds and sixths give this kind<br/>&gt; of texture a &quot;sinuous&quot; quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, I often enjoy passages of this kind in 29-tone equal<br/>&gt; temperament (29-tET) with major thirds and sixths somewhat wider than<br/>&gt; Pythagorean. Going much beyond this, however, some Setharean timbre<br/>&gt; adjustments may be in order to keep these unstable intervals<br/>&gt; _relatively_ blending; with such adjustments, 17-tET can also be<br/>&gt; delightful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Carl Dahlhaus has written, there is a neat correspondence between<br/>&gt; the &quot;acoustical surface&quot; of Pythagorean tuning and the musical<br/>&gt; style of the 13th and 14th centuries, with octaves, fifths, and<br/>&gt; fourths serving as the primary concords but various unstable intervals<br/>&gt; also playing a very prominent role.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the later 15th century, however, there is a gap between Pythagorean<br/>&gt; theory and current practice -- although some students of this era have<br/>&gt; recently suggested that singers may have often leaned toward<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intonation in performances of composers such as Ockeghem,<br/>&gt; even as meantone keyboards were becoming the norm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notationally speaking, musicians finessed the transition by sticking<br/>&gt; with what one might call an intonationally generic and &quot;equitonal&quot;<br/>&gt; notation corresponding closely to either the old Pythagorean or the<br/>&gt; new meantone system, but not explicitly recognizing the complication<br/>&gt; of the syntonic comma for flexible-pitch performers negotiating the<br/>&gt; tertian styles now in vogue with thirds at or close to 5:4 or 6:5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 3. Modality, centers, and intonation: Vicentino-Monteverdi<br/>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; During the era of 1540-1640, music is based on a very flexible system<br/>&gt; of 12 modes, sometimes freely ornamented and mixed together in manners<br/>&gt; advocated in the earlier part of this period by the composer and<br/>&gt; theorist Nicola Vicentino (1555), and in the latter part by such<br/>&gt; musicians as Claudio Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare<br/>&gt; Monteverdi (1607).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I would like to focus on the general question of accidentalism,<br/>&gt; the matter of Zarlino&apos;s experimental JI keyboard, and my views of the<br/>&gt; modes in practice around 1600.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 3.1. Accidentalism in Manneristic modality (1540-1640)<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In viewing the accidentalism of the 16th and early 17th centuries,<br/>&gt; including the direct chromaticism of a Vicentino or Gesualdo as well<br/>&gt; as the routine inflections taken for granted by Zarlino, it is very<br/>&gt; important to place this question in the perspective of earlier Gothic<br/>&gt; practice and theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the accidentals Eb, F#, and C# -- in addition to the fluid step<br/>&gt; B/Bb (German H/B) of the regular gamut -- are in use by the era of<br/>&gt; Perotin around 1200, these inflections plus G# become a routine<br/>&gt; feature of the early Ars Nova in the era around 1300.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such accidentals are frequently mandated by the pattern of &quot;closest<br/>&gt; approach&quot; -- the norm that unstable intervals should resolve to &quot;the<br/>&gt; nearest consonance.&quot; Thus a third expanding to a fifth or sixth<br/>&gt; expanding to an octave by contrary motion should be major, while a<br/>&gt; third contracting to a unison should be minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This convention calls for a regular use of _musica ficta_, &quot;invented<br/>&gt; notes&quot; outside the regular gamut of diatonic notes plus Bb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 16th-century modality, such inflections are one side of a modal<br/>&gt; system also routinely using accidentals by the 1520&apos;s to obtain major<br/>&gt; thirds above the lowest voice in closing sonorities -- the use of<br/>&gt; thirds in such sonorities becoming increasingly the norm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From my perspective, at least, a balanced view of our Manneristic<br/>&gt; period from Rore and Vicentino to Monteverdi and Frescobaldi should<br/>&gt; take account of at least three factors:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) The modal system, including its creative ambiguities and<br/>&gt; affinities between related modes with similar species of fifths and<br/>&gt; fourths (or pentachords and tetrachords);<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) The element of vertical sonority, now clearly shifted in practice<br/>&gt; and theory from the Gothic trine (2:3:4) to the _harmonia perfetta_ of<br/>&gt; Zarlino&apos;s &quot;third plus fifth or sixth&quot; (e.g. 4:5:6); and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) The often guiding role of &quot;closest approach&quot; and related<br/>&gt; progressions, some borrowed from the Gothic era, in directing the flow<br/>&gt; of saturated tertian sonorities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously a 16th-century system of meantone, or of adaptive JI with<br/>&gt; minute adjustments to finesse the syntonic comma while maintaining<br/>&gt; pure vertical concords, neatly fits item (2). However, musicians such<br/>&gt; as Netherlands just intonation advocate Peter van Marissing have<br/>&gt; suggested a more subtle connection between intonation and vertical<br/>&gt; organization.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In meantone, major and minor thirds are pure or nearly pure, and the<br/>&gt; late modal style of organization often features relationships between<br/>&gt; sonorities with lowest notes a third apart. Such relations are common<br/>&gt; in medieval chant and polyphony, but take on new aspects in a tertian<br/>&gt; environment, some of them involving striking forms of accidentalism<br/>&gt; including direct chromaticism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the same time, the late Gothic principle of &quot;closest approach&quot; also<br/>&gt; takes on new forms, as such a scholar as Carl Dahlhaus has found in<br/>&gt; his study of compositions around 1600.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider a progression in a setting in E Phrygian like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E4   F#4  G4<br/>&gt; B3   D4   E4<br/>&gt; G#3  A3   C4<br/>&gt; E3   D3   C3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8 -  10 - 12<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here there is no direct chromaticism -- the use of chromatic semitone<br/>&gt; steps -- but a use of accidentals producing three consecutive<br/>&gt; sonorities with what Zarlino terms harmonic divisions of the fifth<br/>&gt; (fifth plus major third above the bass).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From one viewpoint, we might focus on the stepwise contrary motion of<br/>&gt; the outer parts from octave to major tenth to twelfh. The smoothly<br/>&gt; conjunct motion prevailing has a &quot;late tertian/modal flavor&quot; of its<br/>&gt; own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Taking the perspective of closest approach, we note that the first<br/>&gt; sonority is connected to the second by a major third expanding to a<br/>&gt; fifth between the lower pair of voices (E3-G#3 to D3-A3), and the<br/>&gt; second sonority to the third by a similar expansion of major tenth to<br/>&gt; twelfth between the outer voices (D3-F#3 to C3-G3).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus does a familiar 14th-century cadential progression take on new<br/>&gt; sonorous shape, Pythagorean intonation compellingly reflecting the<br/>&gt; original context, and meantone or adaptive just intonation the<br/>&gt; 16th-century adaptation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the beauty of this progression speaks for itself, we might add<br/>&gt; from a free modal perspective that the motion of the bass E3-D3-C3<br/>&gt; connects the Phyrgian final E, the note of repose, with the common<br/>&gt; confinal or &quot;co-final&quot; C, often favored for intermediate cadences.<br/>&gt; This &quot;third-related&quot; connection is a delightful aspect of Manneristic<br/>&gt; practice sometimes inspiring boldly direct chromaticism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, consider a progression like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A4 A4<br/>&gt; F4 E4<br/>&gt; C4 C#4<br/>&gt; F3 A3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such idioms have a logic of their own, constrained neither by the<br/>&gt; earlier modal practice of a composer such as Josquin, nor by the<br/>&gt; major/minor key system established in the later 17th century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In his analysis of Monteverdi, Carl Dahlhaus concludes that many of<br/>&gt; his progressions fit the &quot;closest approach&quot; paradigm mentioned as a<br/>&gt; basic element of counterpoint by such an early 17th-century &quot;modern&quot;<br/>&gt; as Agazzari in his presentation on continuo (1607), but not the<br/>&gt; expectations of key tonality, citing especially examples like the<br/>&gt; following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E4  F#3          G4  A4<br/>&gt; B3  D4           D4  F4<br/>&gt; G#3 A3           B3  C4<br/>&gt; E3  D3     or    G3  F3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These progressions again involve the common expansion of major third<br/>&gt; to fifth in contexts where Dahlhaus remarks that major/minor tonality<br/>&gt; would suggest a different treatment. He comments that while<br/>&gt; conventional histories often look for instances where inflections<br/>&gt; seem to fit a &quot;major/minor&quot; pattern, they may disregard choices which<br/>&gt; seem to have the opposite effect, but fit the concept of &quot;closest<br/>&gt; approach&quot; as applied in a tertian setting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the same time, Dahlhaus emphasizes that such compositions do not<br/>&gt; conveniently fit either classic 16th-century modal theory or<br/>&gt; 18th-century tonal theory. In their manifesto of 1607, the Monteverdi<br/>&gt; brothers themselves declare that this music belongs to a tradition of<br/>&gt; freely mixing modes in order to express the words and affections<br/>&gt; (i.e. emotions) of a text, an ethos for which we have an eloquent<br/>&gt; statement in Vicentino.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A &quot;polymodal&quot; approach to composers such as Monteverdi and Gesualdo,<br/>&gt; like any theoretical approach, must fall short of a full appreciation<br/>&gt; of the music, but seems to me both enticing and evocative, with<br/>&gt; &quot;closest approach&quot; as discussed by Dahlhaus providing one historical<br/>&gt; foundation for what in the 21st century remains justly famed as a<br/>&gt; radically innovative style.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 3.2. Zarlino&apos;s JI keyboard and the modal system<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Paul Erlich has remarked, Zarlino&apos;s JI keyboard with its 16 notes<br/>&gt; per octave (including two versions of D, Bb, F#, and Eb) is presented<br/>&gt; by Zarlino himself as an experimental instrument, difficult to play<br/>&gt; and much less practical than a temperament such as his own 2/7-comma<br/>&gt; meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The main conclusion I draw from playing a 15-note variation on<br/>&gt; Zarlino&apos;s instrument mapped to two keyboard manuals is that managing<br/>&gt; any piece in any mode that frequently calls for fifths at both D-A and<br/>&gt; G-D is likely indeed to be &quot;difficult,&quot; just as Zarlino observes.<br/>&gt; These fifths are likely to occur in any of the modes, not only in the<br/>&gt; obvious D Dorian or G Mixolydian.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a few pieces calling for only one of these fifths (interestingly<br/>&gt; including a favorite D Dorian piece where G-D happens not to occur),<br/>&gt; or where in my two-manual arrangement the fifths or fourths in<br/>&gt; question happen fortuitously to call for the right hand at the most<br/>&gt; convenient time, this kind of JI can be as easy as meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Otherwise, as Zarlino says, temperament is more practical; and he also<br/>&gt; observes that singers, unlike such special keyboards in the syntonic<br/>&gt; diatonic, can strive for pure consonances without the complication of<br/>&gt; &quot;small intervals&quot; such as the syntonic comma. Could this be a hint<br/>&gt; that adaptive JI was at least sometimes practiced?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like his predecessor Glareanus, Zarlino favors a system of 12 modes,<br/>&gt; with an authentic and plagal form for each of six basic octave-species<br/>&gt; (D, E, F, G, A, and C).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From the perspective of either middle to late 16th-century practice,<br/>&gt; or of later developments, we may duly note that while in 1558 he<br/>&gt; follows the traditional numbering of the modes starting with authentic<br/>&gt; and plagal Dorian (Modes I and II), by the early 1570&apos;s he proposes<br/>&gt; giving the Ionian or C modes pride of place. This renumbering would<br/>&gt; follow the order of the natural hexachord C-A (C ut, D re, E mi, F fa,<br/>&gt; G sol, A la).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, Zarlino is _not_ proposing a reduction of the 12 modes to<br/>&gt; two, or the abolition of the Dorian mode because the fifth D-A<br/>&gt; presents complications in a realization of his syntonic diatonic model<br/>&gt; on a fixed-pitch instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, Zarlino groups the modes (1558) into two families based on<br/>&gt; the natural vertical division of the fifth above the final: in Dorian,<br/>&gt; Aeolian, and Phrygian (D-D, A-A, E-E), the arithmetic division<br/>&gt; prevails with minor third below and major third above (string ratio<br/>&gt; 6:5:4); while in Lydian, Ionian, and Mixolydian (F-F, C-C, G-G) the<br/>&gt; harmonic division obtains with major third below and minor third above<br/>&gt; (string ratio 15:12:10).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He describes the harmonic division with the major third above the<br/>&gt; final as more &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;joyful,&quot; and the arithmetic division with<br/>&gt; the minor third as more &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;gentle.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This harmonic/arithmetic distinction is also expressed in the later<br/>&gt; contrast between major and minor keys, but under different musical<br/>&gt; conditions and with often different organizational structures and<br/>&gt; patterns.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While Zarlino proposes a renumbering of the 12 modes, incidentally,<br/>&gt; musicians of this and the immediately succeeding generation prefer to<br/>&gt; retain the customary numbering as expounded and expanded by<br/>&gt; Glareanus (1547).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The question, &quot;What is the center of the system?&quot; may be based on the<br/>&gt; premise that there is necessarily a specific &quot;center.&quot;  One might<br/>&gt; argue that there are multiple centers, depending on how one chooses to<br/>&gt; view the system at a given moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, the Dorian and Mixolydian modes might represent one kind<br/>&gt; of center, located midway between Lydian and Phyrgian in the set of<br/>&gt; modes (a distinct Lydian being least common in the 16th century):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    F     C        G          D        A       E<br/>&gt; Lydian Ionian Mixolydian | Dorian  Aeolian Phyrgian<br/>&gt; ------------------------   ------------------------<br/>&gt;     harmonic division        arithmetic division<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we take account of Zarlino&apos;s harmonic/arithmetic groupings, then<br/>&gt; Mixolydian and Dorian are the adjacent members of the two groupings,<br/>&gt; sharing the affinity of an upper tetrachord T-S-T (T for whole-tone, S<br/>&gt; for semitone), D-E-F-G or A-B-C-D.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, Zarlino&apos;s theoretical model of the syntonic diatonic and<br/>&gt; his renumbering of the modes suggest C as a center of interest, while<br/>&gt; going back to earlier medieval practice, one could argue on the<br/>&gt; concrete evidence of usual musical clefs that F and C, the diatonic<br/>&gt; notes located immediately above mi-fa semitones (C-fa or F-fa), are<br/>&gt; both salient points of orientation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Applying solmization in a different way, we could point to the<br/>&gt; symmetry of Dorian as a special attraction, with two T-S-T tetrachords<br/>&gt; (re-mi-fa-sol):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D    E   F   G    A   B  C     D<br/>&gt; re   mi  fa  sol  re  mi fa   sol<br/>&gt;   T    S   T    T   T   S   T<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The attraction of multiple centers both in theory and in practice<br/>&gt; lends much charm to the music of this era, along with the element of<br/>&gt; fluid degree inflection inspired by both melodic and vertical<br/>&gt; considerations often differing from those of later tonal styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The typical 12-note meantone compass Eb-G# nicely accommodates the<br/>&gt; usual accidental inflections of the 12 modes, with modal variety<br/>&gt; providing a rich system within a relatively modest range of<br/>&gt; transpositions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is in the late 17th century, when major/minor tonality becomes the<br/>&gt; established paradigm, that Werckmeister&apos;s well-temperaments serve to<br/>&gt; accommodate the greater range of routine transpositions compensating<br/>&gt; for the &quot;bipolar&quot; rather than &quot;multipolar&quot; world of the new system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 3.3. Fluid modality in practice around 1600<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a very perceptive historian, Julius Lester if I recall correctly,<br/>&gt; has observed, debates about the &quot;modal&quot; or &quot;tonal&quot; nature of early<br/>&gt; 17th-century music are inevitably colored by the viewpoints of the<br/>&gt; participants.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have experienced this at first hand, when playing a piece from a<br/>&gt; German keyboard manuscript of this era identified as in the &quot;First<br/>&gt; Tone&quot; (Mode I, D Dorian) for a friend more accustomed to later Baroque<br/>&gt; music, and a far more skilled keyboardist by the way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I experienced as routine cadences or momentary focuses on various<br/>&gt; degrees of the mode, she noted as &quot;modulations.&quot; In other music from<br/>&gt; this period, she expressed surprise at events which for me seemed less<br/>&gt; remarkable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reading efforts of 20th-century theorists to &quot;explain&quot; progressions<br/>&gt; which seem to me a part of the usual late modal vocabulary also<br/>&gt; suggests that one&apos;s musical background and preferences may shape much<br/>&gt; of the analysis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Recognizing these inevitable and stimulating differences, I would myself<br/>&gt; join with such authors as Arthur Merritt (_Sixteenth Century Polyphony: A<br/>&gt; Basis for the Study of Counterpoint_) and Knud Jeppesen (often cited by<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson in counterpoint-related threads) in viewing the music of<br/>&gt; Palestrina, Lasso, and Victoria as indeed modal, with an interplay of<br/>&gt; multiple centers which Merritt considers a special attraction of this<br/>&gt; period.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In composers of the early 17th-century era such as Giovanni Gabrieli<br/>&gt; and Frescobaldi, I can recognize, for example, &quot;Dorian&quot; idioms; while<br/>&gt; the Phrygian mode has its charms not only in vocal liturgical settings<br/>&gt; such as those of Victoria, but in keyboard music with a distinctly<br/>&gt; &quot;modern&quot; flavor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, a radical musician such as Fabio Colonna (1618) demonstrates the<br/>&gt; transpositions of various modes, including Dorian with its symmetrical<br/>&gt; solmization, on his 31-note _Sambuca Lincea_ or harpsichord dividing<br/>&gt; each tone into five equal parts (a model suggesting a circulating<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma temperament or the later 31-tET).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In proposing an often free intermixture of the 12 modes, or<br/>&gt; &quot;polymodality,&quot; as one standpoint from which to approach this era --<br/>&gt; and in 1655, Christoph Bernhard presents a 12-mode system while<br/>&gt; discussing many of the new idioms of Monteverdi and his age -- I would<br/>&gt; not wish to suggest that &quot;modality&quot; is the only or most important<br/>&gt; factor in this music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Vertical euphony, closest approach, chromatic idioms, and sheer<br/>&gt; inspiration all play a role in giving this music its character. As one<br/>&gt; historian wrote of a different question, the &quot;medieval/Renaissance&quot;<br/>&gt; distinction, there is enough material here for advocates or &quot;modal&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;tonal&quot; analyses alike to keep busy for some time, and possibly to<br/>&gt; find inspiration for the creation of much new music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most respectfully,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 21<br/>&gt;    Date: Mon, 7 May 2001 10:07:28 +0300 (IDT)<br/>&gt;    From: Robert C Valentine &lt;<a href="mailto:BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM">BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: buckets...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    From: <a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: mistuning of octave considered good<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;   &lt; summarizing the differences between Pauls Harmonic Entropy<br/>&gt;     and my &apos;hacked psuedo harmonic entropy calculation&apos; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                 HE            HPHEC<br/>&gt; 2/1          1200+-42       1200+-30<br/>&gt; 3/2           702+-35        702+-18<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, I gave my tool sharper ears than &apos;typical resolution&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not necessarily!

Perhaps.</p><p>But. if C++ code is so easy to debug that you can get rid of<br/>_all_ the bugs in the same length of time that it takes to<br/>write the code, or less, why are any C++ programs ever released<br/>with bugs in them?

There&apos;s a famous theorem that<br/>if your programming language is sufficiently powerful to<br/>let you write an interpreter of the language in itself Interpr (say),<br/>(which is quite a complex type of program, but not _that_ complex<br/>- the core of c can be interpreted in a dozen or so pages of c-code)<br/>then there is no way to write a program T (say) that can check<br/>whether any program in the language will go into an endless loop or not</p><p>- any such program checking program, if sufficiently powerful to check all<br/>programs, is guaranteed to either give the wrong answer for at least<br/>one input, or to have at least one input that will send it into<br/>an endless loop.</p><p>An endless loop that can&apos;t be avoided would always<br/>be counted as a bug I think = the &quot;This program has stopped<br/>responding to the system&quot; type of bug.</p><p>So one is saying that any program that can check for all possible<br/>bugs in all possible programs in a sufficiently versatile<br/>computing language is guaranteed to have a bug in itself.</p><p>Why? write a program P that reads the testing program T as data,<br/>runs T as interpreted code, with P as the data for T, and then,<br/>by design, goes into an endless loop if T terminates normally<br/>with the answer that P never goes into an endless loop.</p><p>Such a program will just consist of the interpreter Interpr, plus<br/>P and T as data, plus a few extra lines of code to set T<br/>as the program for the interpreter to run, and P itself as the<br/>data for T, plus an extra couple of lines to go into an endless loop<br/>depending on the output from T when run in the interpreter.</p><p>One could write this a little more formally as something like:</p><p>Define A(x) = return value for A with x as data</p><p>Suppose we have a program T that satisfies<br/>T (x) = TRUE if x terminates normally.<br/>T (x) = FALSE if x goes into an endless loop.</p><p>and an intepreter<br/>Interpr(x,y) = interpreter with x as program, y as data<br/>               and output of x(y) as return value</p><p>I.e. Interpr is a program that can be given any other<br/>program x as one input file, and the data y for x as a second<br/>input file, and will then interpret x, and return with<br/>the return value for x(y)</p><p>Now make<br/>P(x,y) =<br/>&quot;<br/>if(Interpr(x,y)== TRUE)<br/>  go into endless loop<br/>else<br/> exit<br/>&quot;</p><p>Then run P(T,P)</p><p>Now the question is, does T (when interpreted in this way)<br/>say that P goes into an endless loop?</p><p>If T answers Yes, then P by design doesn&apos;t go into one. If<br/>T answers No, then P by design does.</p><p>Either way, T gives the wrong answer.</p><p>If T goes into an endless loop itself, which is a third way out,<br/>then it has a bug in it too, as we agree (I hope) that an unintended<br/>endless loop is a bug.</p><p>There is a way out of all that, but not a very desirable one.</p><p>Idea is, T is okay (doesn&apos;t have a bug in it) but P now has a bug,<br/>and since P is a pretty simple program apart from the interpreter,<br/>then the most likely conclusion is that Interpr has one now, and<br/>doesn&apos;t do what it is designed to do; doesn&apos;t run T correctly.</p><p>But the argument will work if there is any bug free interpreter<br/>that can be written in the language. So this way out isn&apos;t<br/>that desirable either - means it is completely impossible to<br/>write any bug free interpreter of the language in itself,<br/>though perhaps plenty of buggy ones. I think one would be a bit<br/>wary of using such a language!</p><p>So looks as though a provably correct programming language has<br/>to step very warily when it gets to the stage where one<br/>is making a program as complex as an interpreter, and<br/>must somehow prevent you from writing a complete interpreter<br/>of itself in itself (Interpr). I.e lets you write T perhaps,<br/>but not Interpr, and so not P.</p><p>Or alternatively, it lets you write Interpr, but<br/>not T.</p><p>I.e. alternatively, you can&apos;t write the program that can be used to prove<br/>correctness of other programs in the language.</p><p>Perhaps this seems a more promising approach to<br/>use. But then this means that the program for proving<br/>correctness can&apos;t itself be proved to be correct using<br/>its own methods.</p><p>I suppose that isn&apos;t so bad - T would be quite a complex program,<br/>but you only have one program to write, and you do it very<br/>carefully, then after that, all the other ones will be<br/>provably correct - always assuming you never introduced any<br/>bugs in T. But you will never know for sure that T has no<br/>bugs in, or at least, even if completely convinced,<br/>won&apos;t be able to use T to check itself.</p><p>Your programs will also be limited to some extent in what<br/>they can do, but if T is well designed, mightn&apos;t be much<br/>of a drawback at all, might only apply to _really_ esoteric<br/>mathematical things that no-one is likely to ever want to be<br/>able to do, not even mathematicians (hopefully! There&apos;s always<br/>a possibility, maybe a strong one, that when excluding these<br/>really esoteric things, one might also exclude some as yet<br/>unforseen mainstream things as well).</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what the theorists do at this point. I expect<br/>they then resort to a powerful but reasonably straightforward<br/>mathematical theory that is believed to be correct, though<br/>it can&apos;t be proved to be so, such as the axiomatisation of<br/>arithmetic + universal and existential quantification.<br/>But that is a pretty simple theory, so they will have<br/>to make severe restrictions on the programming language<br/>to make it impossible to code a theorem tester for the<br/>meta theory (once you&apos;ve got one of those, you&apos;ve almost<br/>got the program T).</p><p>Have to say here, I&apos;ve no idea how they actually design<br/>these provably correct programming languages, just know<br/>about them in theory. Might be interesting to learn more.</p><p>In practice, T would be more complex than just saying whether<br/>P goes into an endless loop or not. But one of the bugs<br/>it would be expected to detect would certainly be the endless loops,<br/>and if ti can catch those at all, then that is enough for<br/>the conclusions to hold.</p><p>Anyway, the conclusion is clear, making provably correct<br/>code is possible, but must be at least slightly limited in scope.</p><p>Maybe someone will design a reasonably versatile language in which<br/>only provably correct programs can be written, and which<br/>is reasonably easy to use. That would be a great boon.<br/>It mightn&apos;t completely eliminate bugs as there are two things,<br/>whether the program does what it is supposed to do, and<br/>whether what it was supposed to do was a sensible thing<br/>to do in the first place.</p><p>It can&apos;t eliminate the bugs that are there because the program<br/>is designed to do something that isn&apos;t particularly sensible.<br/>But would eliminate a great many.</p><p>However, looks as though we will still be chasing bugs for some time<br/>to come. Also, looks as if any programs that really push the boundaries<br/>of complexity for a program in innovative ways will - not necessarily<br/>always have bugs in them, but never be conclusively proved by anyone to<br/>be totally bug free.</p><p>N.B. Godel&apos;s incompleteness theorem that Jacky quoted uses<br/>essentially the same type of idea, but in the context<br/>of any provable correct formal system instead of any<br/>provably correct programming language.</p><p>Changing from programming language to formal system<br/>changes the way that one has to set about proving it,<br/>and the proof gets a fair bit longer. Both results, by<br/>Turing, and Godel (plus a third theorem of similar<br/>nature by Tarski) were published in the same year<br/>I believe, some time around 1939.</p><p>Proving Godel&apos;s theorem is the kind of thing that requires<br/>quite a lot of lines. But proving Turings theorem is easy<br/>especially if one can assume knowledge of the basic ideas<br/>of a computing language, which of course wasn&apos;t the case<br/>in 1939 - basically I&apos;ve done it here (using some ideas<br/>from my phd supervisor&apos;s way of presenting it).</p><p>The results can also be interpreted positively, as saying<br/>that there is no limit that can be set to innovation<br/>in programming, or in mathematics.</p><p>There is no way to churn out a list of all possible<br/>good programs, no matter how long you have for the task,<br/>or how versatile your language, as any such enumeration<br/>will be guaranteed to have gaps in it.</p><p>Similarly, no way to enumerate all possible true theorems<br/>of mathematics, no matter how rich your mathematical methods.</p><p>Just to make this on topic (slightly):</p><p>There&apos;s no way to enumerate all possible tunings and their properties,<br/>no matter how versatile your methods.</p><p>Always, there will be new scales, and new properties of scales,<br/>to surprise us, into the endless future.</p><p>This isn&apos;t usually added, but I think perhaps it also means that<br/>there will also always be some potential for mistakes when doing really<br/>innovative mathematics, thinking one has proved something, then on reflection<br/>and finding out more in the field, finding that one hasn&apos;t after all.</p><p>I suppose this is rather OT, but does relate to a few recent things posted<br/>to TL, and it is easy to press the delete key.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=22440 href="#22440">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2001 10:19:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Should be:</p><p>Suppose we have a program T with two input files as data that satisfies<br/>T (x,y) = TRUE if x terminates normally with y as data.<br/>T (x,y) = FALSE if x goes into an endless loop with y as data.</p><p>Define<br/>T&apos;(x) = T(x,x)</p><p>and an intepreter<br/>Interpr(x,y) = interpreter with x as program, y as data<br/>               and output of x(y) as return value</p><p>I.e.
