Now write a program to do this automatically. :)</p><p>Your description of your procedure sounds to me as if you are using 72 in support of compton temperament, the 12&amp;72 temperament tempering out both the Pythagorean comma and 225/224. One possible generator is the tempered version of 81/80, a single step of 72 if you are using 72 for a tuning, an idea which makes a lot of sense. A program to automatically retune 12edo to compton seems to me to be something which might be possible to do.</p></div><h3><a id=90586 href="#90586">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2010 4:57:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Beautiful!</p><p>Really not much else to add but that!</p><p>On Thu, Jun 24, 2010 at 1:55 PM, Danny Wier &lt;dawiertx@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I forgot to mention in my return to the list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dannywier.ucoz.com/clair_de_lune.mp3">http://dannywier.ucoz.com/clair_de_lune.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the most famous part of Debussy&apos;s Bergamasque, retuned to a 72edo<br/>&gt; approximation of JI.
