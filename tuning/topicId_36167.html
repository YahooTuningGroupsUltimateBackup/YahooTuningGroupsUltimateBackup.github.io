The previous organist Ahle was a friend of Werckmeister and Kuhnau actually declared that the organ builder Wender, who also built the organ in Arnstadt, insisted on Werckmeister tuning.</p><p>This now means that all the cities Bach worked in were ALREADY in Wercmeister tuning.  Check out the article in the Bach Jahrbook upcoming edition (which was given to me at the Bach Archiv in Leipzig). My hunch about Muhlhause has paid off big time.  The city now is weird.  An Auschwitz memorial greets one at the train station.  There are almost no people.  The church where Bach worked is huge...but was closed.</p><p>More later, after Berlin.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
