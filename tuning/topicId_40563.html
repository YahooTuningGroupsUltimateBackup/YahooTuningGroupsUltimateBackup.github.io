There is no stock at this time, although they are being<br/>mastered this month.  At present, I have been asking permissions and<br/>corresponding with publishers so that I can meet every responsibility.  The<br/>plan is to have 50 copies of each CD program.  Selling enough of these at $17<br/>per CD will allow for the making of 1,000 more.</p><p>For the sake of working in the traditional manner of the List, I thought less<br/>is more for the moment.  However, I think I can introduce each CD in a<br/>different post.  Maybe there will be some discussion about the choices.  As<br/>soon as the List has explored the contents of a CD, I will move on, and<br/>report on its status.</p><p>P-200201    AVANTE<br/>1       Hugh Davies         Differentials [WW trio emphasizing difference<br/>tones]</p><p>2   I   Philip Corner       (two) Microtonal Melodies [Peter Zummo, tbn/<br/>3   II                                         Johnny Reinhard, theremin<br/>[suggestive intonation]</p><p>4       Ulrich Krieger      Rote Erde [UK on tenor sax/Joshua Pierce, piano]<br/>                                                 [clearly microtonal as a red<br/>sanded desert]</p><p>5       Johnny Reinhard     9/11 was written in Toronto and performed in<br/>Winnipeg<br/>                                     and Vancouver.
