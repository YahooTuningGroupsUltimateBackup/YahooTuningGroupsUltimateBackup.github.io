Sometime we<br/>are permitted copies, the Barbican not.  The &quot;U.S. Highball&quot; recording is<br/>owned by Swiss Radio.  Roger Merrick is endeavoring to have them released.</p><p>An upcoming issue of Avant Magazine is considering a release of an earlier<br/>&quot;Dark Brother&quot; performance.  I have given the okay, but the performance we<br/>did at the Barbican was more advanced in several ways.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
