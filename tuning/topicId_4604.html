I see you are right about consonance. But please wait.<br/>&gt;In fact I was just talking about complexity. Not consonance.<br/>&gt;I thought complexity and consonance were two different things.<br/>&gt;Complexity is just a matter of how complex a range of numbers<br/>&gt;behave to each other, a matter of Maths (and maybe Physics).<br/>&gt;And consonance as a matter of how we hear and feel all this,<br/>&gt;a matter of Human Perception and anatomy of the human ear.<br/>&gt;No ?</p><p>The reason we are looking at numerical complexity in the first place is<br/>because we believe it is related to consonance. The three factors we&apos;ve<br/>identified as important to consonance are complexity, tolerance, and span<br/>(thanks Dave Keenan). For small enough numbers, tolerance is not too<br/>important, and if we compare intervals of similar sizes, span is not<br/>important. So the examples above are fairly valid in equating complexity<br/>with dissonance. If we divorce complexity from the perception of dissonance,<br/>how could we possibly decide on one complexity measure over another? Without<br/>human perception, the numbers representing the musical tones have no<br/>meaning. Physics is relevant but only to the extent that we are dealing with<br/>the physics of the human hearing apparatus.</p><p>The three major phenomena which explain the consonance of simple ratios --<br/>roughness, tonalness, and nonlinear combination tones -- may each have a<br/>different complexity formulation that best models their effects. For<br/>example, the roughness of otonal chords (harmonic series chords) and utonal<br/>chords (their mirror reflections) tend to be similar, while tonalness and<br/>combination tones clearly favor otonal over utonal chords. A simple formula<br/>like LCM or what have you is not going to get at the effects of all three.</p><p>Glen wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Glen Peterson:]<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;I have also been wondering if I even consider &quot;fourths and fifths&quot; to<br/>&gt;&gt; be consonant or dissonant.  They are almost neither.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; If a fifth is not consonant, what is?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [Dan Stearns]<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;fourths and fifths&quot;  occupy some<br/>&gt;&gt; indeterminate zone between (overtly) &apos;sweet&apos; and &apos;sour.&apos;</p><p>&gt;Well put.  They somehow sound too plain to my ears to get that feeling of<br/>&gt;consonance.  Maybe consonance is the wrong word?</p><p>Here&apos;s where the cultural/historical aspect of my theory comes in. In<br/>medieval music, only fourths and fifths were consonances. Ever since thirds<br/>and sixths took over that role in the Renaissance, and triadic texture<br/>became the norm for stability, a bare fourth or fifth would be an<br/>interruption that texture, a sonority with lower tension than that<br/>associated with the point of repose. &quot;Too plain&quot; is an apt description. In<br/>jazz, triads are &quot;too plain.&quot; In my decatonic system, 7-limit tetrads become<br/>the norm, the point of lowest tension. But I don&apos;t think &quot;plainness&quot; takes<br/>away from &quot;consonance&quot;. What could be more consonant that plain old octaves<br/>and unisons?</p><p>&gt;Have I got this right?</p><p>&gt;Roughness = Proximity to a small whole number ratio creates a tension<br/>called<br/>&gt;roughness.  i.e., 301/200 will be heard as a mistuned 3/2.</p><p>No. Roughness is the sensation created when partial tones interfere with one<br/>another. This happens if they are too close to be separately resolved by the<br/>cochlea (i.e., less than a minor third), but too far to blend into a single,<br/>slowly beating tone.</p><p>For timbres with harmonic partials, roughness is minimized at simple-integer<br/>ratios, because then pairs of partials coincide and do not interfere with<br/>one another.</p><p>&gt;Tonalness = How closely the interval fulfils the ear&apos;s desire for<br/>completion<br/>&gt;of a harmonic series of tones.</p><p>Yes. Or partial completion -- at least enough to determine the fundamental.</p><p>&gt;Difference tones = The difference between two pitches creates another<br/>pitch.<br/>&gt;Most noticeable in with high frequency pitches played closely together.</p><p>Yes. There are also other combination tones, such a 2*a-b, etc.</p><p>&gt;If I&apos;m on the right track, then what does this mean, &quot;For sine waves,<br/>simple<br/>&gt;integer ratios no longer minimize roughness, but they still maximize<br/>&gt;tonalness?&quot;  I would think that, &quot;For sine waves, Tonalness is less of a<br/>&gt;factor, because there is no harmonic series in the actual tones.  Roughness<br/>&gt;and difference tones still have an effect.&quot;</p><p>A harmonic series is made up of sine waves, not the other way around.<br/>Therefore putting sine waves in simple-integer ratios fulfills the ear&apos;s<br/>desire for completion of a harmonic series of tones. However, since sine<br/>waves don&apos;t have upper partials, simple-integer ratios won&apos;t minimize<br/>roughness.</p><p>&gt;What about, &quot;Simple-integer ratios come into the picture because if the<br/>&gt;heard tones are to be understood as harmonic overtones of some missing<br/>&gt;fundamental or root, they must form a simple-integer ratio with one<br/>&gt;another.&quot;  If this is true, why are simple integer ratios so powerful with<br/>&gt;sine waves?</p><p>Simple-integer ratios can matter for sine waves (a) because overtones _are_<br/>sine waves by definition, and (b) because difference tones are most clearly<br/>defined for sine waves, and of the three phenomena, difference tones impose<br/>the tighest tolerance on the simple-integer ratios. However, I would say<br/>that simple-integer ratios are not very powerful with sine waves because<br/>there is no roughness-minimization at work (except at 1:1).</p><p>&gt;Why does Utonality make any sense at all?</p><p>It makes sense for tones with harmonic partials. In a Utonality<br/>1/a:1/b:1/c,..., there is a common overtone, which is the a_th harmonic of<br/>the first note, the b_th harmonic of the second note, the c_th harmonic of<br/>the third note, etc.</p><p>&gt;I had a 23 note JI glass organ for a while,</p><p>&gt;<a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/Glen/Instruments/Glass_Organ/glass_organ.html">http://www.organicdesign.org/Glen/Instruments/Glass_Organ/glass_organ.html</a></p><p>&gt;the tone of which had a very profound fundamental, and weak partials in<br/>&gt;various patterns.  My experience in playing it was that Otonalities and<br/>&gt;Utonalities were equally consonant,</p><p>Were you only playing triads or did you try tetrads, pentads, hexads as<br/>well? Did you try chords that were neither otonal or utonal (like<br/>10:12:15:18 or 12:14:18:21)? By the way, your layout has some severe<br/>departures from the Incipient Tonality Diamond -- what were the exact<br/>Otonalities and Utonalities you were trying to use? Also, perhaps the<br/>voicings (i.e., inversions) you used in the utonalities were more favorable<br/>than the ones in the otonalities, counteracting the expected tonalness<br/>effects.</p><p>What about intervals -- were the simple ratios clearly different from the<br/>complex ones? It is possible that whatever weak partials you may have had<br/>were not harmonic ones, so there would be no particular preference for<br/>small-integer ratios except:</p><p>&gt;except with high notes close together<br/>&gt;where difference tones were audibly harmonizing with the Otonalities, and<br/>&gt;not with the Utonalities.</p><p>Right -- difference tones favor otonal chords.</p></div><h3><a id=4613 href="#4613">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/1999 8:16:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt;But I don&apos;t think &quot;plainness&quot; takes away from &quot;consonance&quot;.</p><p>Nor do I...
