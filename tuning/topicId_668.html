Fenech KO&apos;s Callejas in 10</p><p>Fenech breaks his (chronically brittle) hand months before the fight... yet<br/>fearing the fight might not come off he opts not to tell anybody... Come<br/>fight night he attacks with a fearsome virtuostic abandon (and at a<br/>positively inhuman, has-to- be-seen-to-be-believed tempo)... Indomitable<br/>will and an astonishing physicality.</p><p>2. Hagler KO&apos;s Hearns in 3</p><p>Hearns - coming off a devastating second round knockout of Roberto Duran<br/>(who had taken Hagler the distance in his previous bout), catches a charging<br/>Hagler flush (and early) with his best shot(s)&#xFFFD; Hagler freezes for about a<br/>second, then proceeds to assay the definitive testament to a career<br/>characterized by personal determination... Electrifying.</p><p>3. Holyfield  KO&#xFFFD;s Tyson in 11</p><p>When this fight was announced many sports writers were publicly fearing for<br/>(the well worn) Holyfield&#xFFFD;s life&#xFFFD; I remember reading an interview with<br/>Evander the Sunday before the fight in which he said &quot;&#xFFFD;facts can allow you<br/>to quit before you get to truth&#xFFFD;&quot; Tough guy Tyson (looking profoundly<br/>bewildered under the strain of true adversity) crumbles&#xFFFD;  Holyfield&#xFFFD;s post<br/>fight speech is a model of grace, will, and decorum.</p><p>Dan</p><p>NOTE: The above opinions and commentaries reflect beliefs and convictions of<br/>the author...
