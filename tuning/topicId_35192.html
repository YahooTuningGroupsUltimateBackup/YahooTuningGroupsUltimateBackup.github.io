Carl&apos;s piece was supposed to be<br/>&gt; &gt;in JI but it wasn&apos;t, it was played in 12-tET, maybe expressively<br/>&gt; &gt;moving toward Just on occasion,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It wasn&apos;t played in 12, Jonny.  Nor was it played in 5-limit JI, or<br/>&gt; the 7-limit JI it was written in.  I explained this publicly on this<br/>&gt; list, and to you afterwards.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Carl, the point here is that you presented a work that completely<br/>misrepresented itself.  It was supposed to be in JI.  But, hey things happen.<br/> That is what the Microthon was all about.  It was my attempt to give amateur<br/>musicians more opportunity.  It was also a time to have more fun.  I don&apos;t do<br/>them anymore because they are not on the same professional level as AFMM<br/>concerts, which you have apparently never attended.</p><p>&gt; Your bassoon piece, which consisted of you disassembling your bassoon<br/>&gt; on stage and clicking the keys -- this was microtonal?<br/>&gt;</p><p>As I have announced since 1981, I consider all music microtonal.  Zanzibar<br/>used multiphonics, 7-tone equal temperament, morphings of the instrument,<br/>sound effects include muting, a ping pong ball vibrating and bouncing, a<br/>quartertone jazz riff, a modal theme using the 7/6 prominently, and much more<br/>difficult to describe.  When you compose more you will come to realize that<br/>one does not repeat in composition, and there a multiplicity of styles with<br/>which one can compose.  And I did it as a duet for 2 bassoons!  It is<br/>academic in the negative sense to have music &quot;sound&quot; microtonal.  The music<br/>says more than the actual microtones (or more accurately, the microtonal<br/>intervals) deliver.</p><p>&gt; &gt;but obviously to me that it was played wrong.  Kyle Gann heard it,<br/>&gt; &gt;too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also explained the failure of the performance to Kyle, when I<br/>&gt; spoke to him afterwards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s funny you bring this up, because I was earlier going to mention<br/>&gt; Kyle&apos;s comments here, but decided not to.  Kyle asked me how the<br/>&gt; piece was notated.  I told him in meantone.  His asked me how this<br/>&gt; was possible.  I told him it was possible to notate 7-limit JI to a<br/>&gt; good approximation using standard meantone notation.  His eyes glazed<br/>&gt; over and after a pause, he walked away.</p><p>I bet Kyle already knew that about the notation and was fishing for why the<br/>performance turned out the way it did.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Carl&apos;s response to the Flux quartet is ignorant since these players<br/>&gt; &gt;have worked with me on microtonal music for years<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I said they were an exception!</p><p>You&apos;ll have to explain better what you mean by &quot;exception.&quot;  I trained Tom<br/>Chiu microtonally and he trained the Flux Quartet.  In fact, the original<br/>cellist of the group was trained by me and he trained the other players as<br/>well.  Before you announce to the world on the internet that it is just as<br/>easy for regulars to play accurate microtones as specialists (which is a<br/>backhanded compliment to musicians at large, and which graciously includes<br/>most microtonal specialists (Greg Evans-horn, Michiyo Suzuki-clarinet, Dave<br/>Eggar-cello, Tom Chiu-violin, Andrew Bolotowsky-flute, etc.), get a hold of<br/>yourself.  Really, I am a bit surprised by your responses, naive by most any<br/>measurement.</p><p>   &gt; There&apos;s no line in the sand, Jonny.  I&apos;ve always supported your<br/>&gt; efforts in what little ways I could.  It is you who have taken<br/>&gt; my answer to Paul as an insult, which it was not.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am not insulted, I don&apos;t think.</p><p>&gt; You rehearse my brass quartet.  That I find insulting, now as the<br/>&gt; first time you offered.</p><p>This was your greatest error.  This is what I do best.  That you don&apos;t<br/>appreciate my involvement in positively shaping music in live performance is<br/>clear.  I have been embarrassed by a few things on my concerts, but I have<br/>learned not to repeat mistakes.  Most people appreciate it when the director<br/>offers to take a listen a make a comment towards the concert&apos;s success.</p><p>   In fact my brass quartet played at AFMM<br/>   cold, and made many mistakes, besides not rendering the intonation<br/>&gt; correctly.  I wish I could have rehearsed them, but it wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; possible.  They were scattered around the globe until the night<br/>&gt; before.  As I told you when you offered me the gig, I wasn&apos;t looking<br/>&gt; to perform anything, and took the gig only reluctantly (for personal<br/>&gt; reasons).</p><p>I don&apos;t know your personal reasons, and I was not aware of this situation.<br/>Because it was the Microthon I let it go.  In fact, the mistakes were not<br/>glaring at all.  Under the circumstances, however, you should have canceled.</p><p>   Still, I would have liked to put on a better show, and<br/>&gt; apologize for not doing so.  Still, there was more content in my<br/>&gt; presentation than in many there that day, in my opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>In your mind, that may well be so.  But I bet there were a lot of composers<br/>there that night who felt the same way about their own particular pieces.<br/>Maybe you don&apos;t feel improv can be microtonal because it swoops around.  The<br/>musician can have points of reference that are microtonal while playing<br/>glissandi in all directions.  How could you, as a listener tell?  I don&apos;t<br/>think that you, Carl, could.  Nor could most anyone, even LOOKING at the<br/>score.  But it doesn&apos;t make it any less microtonal.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=35331 href="#35331">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2002 10:49:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve spent my entire life making music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You&apos;re still young: I have empirical evidence of this! :)</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>&gt;&gt;What kind of groups do you play with?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;San Diego Symphony, Pacific Symphony Orchestra, San Diego Opera,<br/>&gt;La Jolla Chamber Music Society, etc. Boring, but I have a long<br/>&gt;track record and resume in groups that regularly perform on a<br/>&gt;professional level, and I clock probably 120+ concerts a year.</p><p>Cool!

I&apos;ve got 10 years between 4 amateur choirs,<br/>starting at the age of 5.  7 years of piano, starting at age 17,<br/>including two paying solo gigs in 2000 and two non-paying band<br/>gigs in 1997.  I took a year of classical lessons at Moravian<br/>college in Bethlehem and one year of jazz at Indiana University, Bloomington.  6 months in a 1-once-a-week Barbershop quartet<br/>rehearsals in 1997.  4 years playing the trumet, in three different<br/>school ensembles concurrently.  I&apos;ve written roughly 30 short<br/>works for chamber ensemble, three of which have been performed<br/>publicly.  I was a member for 3 months in the Exotic Music<br/>ensemble (about once a week) in Gainesville, Florida.  I&apos;ve played<br/>in countless fireside drum circles, and attended many, many<br/>concerts all around the world.  And I&apos;ve got a recording<br/>collection to rival that of the Almighty Himself.</p><p>In short, I&apos;m an amateur.  I futz with computers for a living.  I&apos;ve<br/>also worked retail at a hiking shop, and in a grocery store.  And<br/>I&apos;ve temped in several offices.  And I ghost wrote dummies books for<br/>a guy for 6 months in 1998.</p><p>Now you know.  Feel better?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Okay- let&apos;s try it with Brahms.

It is not JI, or Jon Catler would never have changed his guitars<br/>to JI from 31.  If you heard the 2 side by side, you could tell the<br/>difference.  There is a different feel, a different gestalt, a different<br/>texture, character...31-tET is spicy 1/4 comma meantone that modulates<br/>forever.</p><p>72 is, likewise, not JI.  Yes, the closeness of some intervals to JI nooks<br/>improves its use as a tuning, but it is not JI.  And if there is a keyboard<br/>playing, 72-notes will not move towards just.  And if there is any complexity<br/>of the 72-note piece then there will not be to much movement toward JI.<br/>Likewise, in 12-tET musicians do not play just thirds, even without<br/>keyboards.  String players usually sharpen their thirds when given a chance,<br/>contrary to JI&apos;s 5/4.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=35343 href="#35343">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2002 12:07:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>The problem, at least as I see it, isn&apos;t saying &apos;suppose this&apos; or<br/>&apos;suppose that&apos;, but rather how what you say actually reads... what you<br/>initially wrote that got me going was:</p><p>&quot;If these 72-toners can actually play, well, let&apos;s face it: they<br/>can&apos;t.
