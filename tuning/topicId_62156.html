And I&apos;m sincerely very happy having found you discussing beat rates<br/>more closely now. Gene can confirm that last year I was experimenting with<br/>them a lot. And it&apos;s still one of my favorite subjects in the huge amount of<br/>possible interval and tuning properties today.</p><p>In December last year, I made two scales, both of which were tuned as<br/>12-tone quasi-meantone chains of fifths from F to A# (i.e. sharps only).<br/>Unlike my previous quasi-meantone scales, these two were made using a<br/>completely different method. And you&apos;ll see very soon what I mean if you<br/>pick up either &quot;parizek_qmeb1&quot; or &quot;parizek_qmeb2&quot; from Manuel&apos;s archive,<br/>execute &quot;Set frequency&quot; followed by the number given in the description, and<br/>then &quot;Show/test beat 3/2 5/3 5/4 7/4 7/6&quot;. I think this will make it clear<br/>to you where I got all those strange ratios.</p><p>Gene, having known how much you had helped me last year, I wished you could<br/>also have seen my new discovery. Sadly, I didn&apos;t have your e-address at that<br/>time; so now you can see them together with others.</p><p>A few words to Carl now. I don&apos;t know what was the timbre of the sounds you<br/>used in your &quot;.wav&quot; files but I&apos;m unable to hear the minor third beats in<br/>these. I would prefer a standard sawtooth much more; and maybe even an<br/>octave lower in order the overtone frequencies wouldn&apos;t get so high. And as<br/>far as your question of making nice beats in triads is concerned, I think it<br/>strongly depends if you play the chord in its root position or not. If you<br/>play a triad of C-E-G, then the minor third beats will appear in the highest<br/>frequency bands. If you play it as G-C-E, this will be true for the major<br/>third. In my oppinion the beating of the fifth should be surely taken into<br/>account because the &quot;almost common&quot; overtone which has these beats is the<br/>lowest of all beating overtones. I personally prefer, when examining a major<br/>triad, to use 3:4:5 as a starting point instead of 4:5:6. For example, when<br/>you use a triad of G3-C4-E4, the lowest beating overtones then are G5 for<br/>the fourth, B5 for the major sixth, and E6 for the major third. Even more,<br/>using 3:4:5 guarantees the same &quot;almost common&quot; fundamental for all<br/>intervals. -- Oh, one more thing. I&apos;m definitely satisfied with your idea of<br/>using &quot;.wav&quot; files. Particularly in my case, if I used pure sawtooth waves,<br/>I doubt a compression like MP3 could leave the important beating<br/>characteristics undamaged.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=62166 href="#62166">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2005 11:17:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gene, having known how much you had helped me last year, I wished<br/>you could<br/>&gt; also have seen my new discovery.
