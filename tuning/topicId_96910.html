A maqam is much more than just a scale/mode...it&apos;s also connected to the language of the culture, the songs they sing, the melodies of those songs, and using a particular maqam scale/mode with the right turn of phrasing, and development of the melodies. To try and isolate the scale notes/pitches doesn&apos;t work, cause that&apos;s NOT the way it was transmitted/learned...it&apos;s part of the culture, overall. Same with blues...when I teach blues, I usually start with the so called &quot;blues scale,&quot; but jeez, it&apos;s way way more than that. Again, it&apos;s about the songs, the rhythms of the lyrics, the phrasing, and much more. When the oud maestros are improvising in a particular maqam form, they have thousands of years of history they are drawing on...and the placement of the pitches is a part of that, for sure...as I mentioned earlier, Rahim Alhaj has told me the pitches of a particular maqam are learned as PART of that particular piece...and a note can be in different pitch areas from maqam to maqam...again, exactly like blues phrasing. I don&apos;t believe the pitches are taught separately from the maqam they are part of...and sure, there have been Arabic theorists who write about the theory of the tunings/pitches, but tuning theory doesn&apos;t seem to be taught as a separate subject, as it&apos;s treated on the tuning lists.</p><p>   Can Akkoc wrote a marvelous paper about pitches in Turkish music (I think &quot;Non Deterministic Pitches in Turkish Music&quot;)...he found that the Turkish maestros were not necessarily singing notes that the theorists said they were...the notes were often not where they were thought to be. Not a big surprise. And this is at the core of maqam pitch concepts...it isn&apos;t about theory, it&apos;s about the maqam, and what that maqam is trying to express. I am very careful about folks who are not a part of a culture trying to analyze what people who ARE a part of that culture are doing. Hanging with the maestros is always a real good idea, as they are the ones doing it. Also listening a great deal, and trying to absorb the SOUND of a music. Arabic/Indian/Turkish traditional musics were long taught in a one on one apprenticeship, where the student imitates the maestro, then goes his/her own way. And since it&apos;s all about individual expression, there are many many ways to interpret a maqam/raga. And the pitches are, again, taught as part of a particular form. Cool stuff...best...Stickman<br/><a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a></p></div>
