It well may be Edouard Lucas<br/>who discovered those, but they are enough universal, I think, to not<br/>be attached to one person.<br/>However I still keep the letter F generally speaking, for what I<br/>found to be the best precise series in any recurrent system. Usually<br/>it is evident, but sometimes it is impossible to say what series it is .</p><p>That YOU only know this one and the F series to have a name only<br/>comforts my thoughts : these are mostly documented by individual<br/>searchers.<br/>Actually a third one, very famous and musical, that you know of<br/>course is<br/>(3) 2  5  7  12 19  31  50...<br/>and I have a tendancy to call it &quot;G&quot; ... like &quot;Golden meantone&quot; or in<br/>french, &quot;Gamme dor&eacute;e&quot;...</p><p>I have been working, years ago, on some classification of the Phi<br/>series and I think I found at least a correct way to specify any of<br/>these series with an exclusive quality, simply from &quot;the first whole<br/>number non-previously covered by more pertinent series...&quot;<br/>Our mathematicians I am sure will find more correct ways to express<br/>that, but here is how it goes :<br/>Just take the whole numbers one by one :<br/>1, 2, 3 (then 5, 8, etc.) are already covered by the F series.<br/>This leaves then 4, whose series has to be defined, and is disputed<br/>by 4&gt;6 and 4&gt;7  :<br/>simply multiply 4 by Phi =  6.472...:  4&gt;6 wins : that should be<br/>rounded to 6, which starts the &quot;2F&quot; series<br/>2 2 4 6 10 16 ...<br/>Next to be defined then is 7, that multiplied by Phi =  11.3256...,<br/>that should be rounded to 11, which starts the &quot;P&quot; series (2) 1 3 4 7<br/>11 18 ...<br/>and so on.<br/>Thus any new series, wether multiples of previous series or &quot;prime&quot;series, can be specified by only one &quot;pertinent&quot; whole number, and<br/>with a basic calculator you may be able then to recover the whole<br/>series.<br/>Therefore any series can be named Phi(n) and this shows a simple<br/>hierarchy between Phi-series :</p><p>Phi(1) = F<br/>Phi(4) = 2F<br/>Phi(7) = P<br/>Phi(9) = 3F<br/>Phi(12) = or the Golden meantone series (2 5 7 12 19 31 50 ...)<br/>Phi(14) = new prime series &gt; 23 37 60 ... (which I provisionally<br/>called &quot;J&quot;)<br/>Phi(17) = another new prime&gt; 28 45 73 ...<br/>Phi(20) = 4F<br/>Phi(22) = 2P<br/>Phi(25) = 5F<br/>Phi(27) = new prime &gt; 44<br/>Phi(30) = new prime &gt; 49<br/>Phi(33) = new prime &gt; 53<br/>Phi(35) = new prime &gt; 57<br/>Phi(38) = new prime &gt; 61<br/>Phi(41) = new prime &gt; 66<br/>Phi(43) = new prime &gt; 70<br/>Phi(46) = 2J, etc.</p><p>Now take the difference between successive (N) and look what hides<br/>behind :<br/>(3 3 2),  3 2 3,  3 2,  3 2 3,  3 2 3 3 2...<br/>... PHI infinite word... but surprisingly not starting from 1, but<br/>from 9 !!!,<br/>which makes it easy anyway to predict at once all these series, that<br/>present here a simple hierarchy.<br/>They can be given letters according to the alphabet some way, but<br/>this matter will certainly be debated, when will be held the next<br/>international convention on recurrent sequences.</p><p>I totally feel like you about numerical series, by force this is only<br/>what I deal with when making and playing photosonic disks, which are<br/>just palettes of frequencies : not knowing what will be the perceived<br/>1/1, and that, in best cases, can well stay as much undefined as we can.<br/>Same thing with &quot;becoming series&quot; too - as I was recently<br/>mentionning, I found one of my favorite scales by taking one every<br/>two degrees in the F series :<br/>3  8  21  55  144 and octaves (a Fibonacci version of Lou Harrison<br/>Aptos School Gamelan slendro) -<br/>Had I choosen instead<br/>5  13  34  89 233 (one step further towards closer approximations of<br/>Phi^2), its music would have been completely different.<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>Jacques~ the series where you start<br/>1 1 3 4 7 11 18......... is called the Lucas series. This is the only<br/>other one i know that has a name. That recurrent sequences have no 1/1<br/>is an important point and also one can seed these formulas with any<br/>ratios one wants ( actually one could feed them with anything and they<br/>will converge.<br/>I have always found the numerical series more to my liking because on<br/>limited acoustic instruments it give subtle but meaningful differences<br/>between the same scale over different tones. What and where one chooses<br/>becomes an &apos;artistic choice&apos;. I tend to like to have the high end of my<br/>scale very converged with working back down into the range in which it<br/>is still &apos;becoming&apos;. With Wilson&apos;s Mt. Meru scales i never start with<br/>the seeds of 1&apos;s and go up to where one is at least in &apos;a ballpark&apos; of<br/>where the interval is heading.<br/>--<br/>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_</p></div>
