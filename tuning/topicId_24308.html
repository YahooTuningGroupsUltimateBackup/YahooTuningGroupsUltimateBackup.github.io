I learned a few things while helping Paul<br/>design his Shrutar.</p><p>Here are what I think are reasonable design constraints.</p><p>All frets must be continuous across the whole width of the neck.<br/>There should only be 21 frets in the octave.<br/>Intervals between adjacent strings should be no smaller than 7:8 and no<br/>larger than 2:3. Maybe 7:8 is too small? Maybe 2:3 is too big?</p><p>Call the particular set of 21 pitches that we are aiming for &quot;the reference<br/>key&quot; (or home key?). Because of the requirement to have all frets<br/>continuous there will be some notes available (on some strings) that are<br/>outside the reference key. We want to minimise the number of such notes and<br/>we want them to occur as far from the nut as possible. So the reference key<br/>should be playable down at least one string (called a reference string) and<br/>also playable across all strings using the frets closest to the nut.<br/>Ideally the highest string should be a reference string to give maximum<br/>range for the reference key.</p><p>What this means is that the &quot;chord&quot; formed by all the open strings must be<br/>as compact as possible on the chain of generators, provided this does not<br/>have other bad consequences like making too many real chords unplayable.</p><p>Here&apos;s what an otonal hexad looks like on a chain of Miracle (7/72 oct)<br/>generators. i.e. octaves are ignored here.</p><p>5 . . . . 7 . 1 . . . . . 3 . . . . . 9 . .11</p><p>That really only gives us two options for sets of string spacings (plus<br/>their rotations and repetitions).</p><p>7:10 7:8  9:11  (spans five generators)<br/>3:4  9:11 9:11  (spans six generators)</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2001 7:32:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s what an otonal hexad looks like on a chain of Miracle (7/72<br/>oct)<br/>&gt; generators. i.e. octaves are ignored here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5 . . . . 7 . 1 . . . . . 3 . . . . . 9 . .11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That really only gives us two options for sets of string spacings<br/>(plus<br/>&gt; their rotations and repetitions).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7:10 7:8  9:11  (spans five generators)<br/>&gt; 3:4  9:11 9:11  (spans six generators)</p><p>That&apos;s not true. There are many more options. The two above do not even<br/>exhaust the possibilities for dividing an octave into 3 parts without<br/>spanning more than 6 generators.</p><p>Although each successive interval between open strings always moves us up<br/>in pitch, it will move either up or down the (octave-equivalent) chain of<br/>Miracle generators.</p><p>Here&apos;s how each interval (with size between 7:8 and 2:3) moves us on the<br/>chain of generators.</p><p>apprx<br/>ratio cents abbr gens<br/>---------------------<br/>7:8   233c  SM2  +2<br/>9:11  350c  n3   +3<br/>diss  467c  s4   +4<br/>5:7   583c  sd5  +5<br/>2:3   700c  P5   +6</p><p>7:10  633c  d5   -5<br/>3:4   500c  P4   -6<br/>4:5   383c  M3   -7<br/>6:7   267c  sm3  -8</p><p>It seems we should exclude 4:5 and 6:7 for now, because we want to minimise<br/>the span in generators and there are so many possibilities to explore<br/>within a span of 6 generators.</p><p>Notice a couple of things from that list. We cannot move by only one<br/>generator, and the only negatives are 7:10 and 3:4 which step by large<br/>numbers of generators.</p><p>The other way of dividing an octave into 3 parts is</p><p>3:4 7:8 467c</p><p>There are also the cases where the octave is split into only 2 parts</p><p>2:3 3:4<br/>5:7 7:10</p><p>And it is possible to avoid octaves altogether and still have 6 open<br/>strings that don&apos;t span more than 6 generators. e.g.</p><p>7:10 9:11 9:11 7:10 9:11</p><p>If I&apos;ve understood Graham Breed&apos;s current suggestion, it goes</p><p>9:11 3:4  9:11 7:10 9:11</p><p>in generators that&apos;s<br/> +3   -6   +3   -5   +3</p><p>Taking the high string as the reference (&quot;r&quot;) string and working from right<br/>to left, we get the keys playable on each string as</p><p>r+2  r+5  r-1  r+2  r-3  r</p><p>So it ranges from r-3 ro r+5, a span of eight generators. I&apos;m hoping we can<br/>do better than that, and stay within r-3 to r+3.</p><p>Remember, the reason we want to do that is to minimise the number of notes<br/>of the reference key that are unavailable on the non-reference strings, and<br/>to maximise the distance from the nut before you lose such a note. A string<br/>which is tuned to r+5 will be missing 5 notes from the reference key. It<br/>will have an additional 5 notes which are not in the reference key.</p><p>Of course we may be able to make use of these extra notes, for example to<br/>let us play some complete hexads. But a Blackjack chain (21 notes in a<br/>chain of 7/72 oct generators) only needs to be extended by 2 notes to get<br/>an otonal hexad (say r-1 to r+1) and you get another otonal hexad for every<br/>note beyond that.</p><p>We can now enumerate all the open string spacings that remain within keys<br/>from r-3 to r+3 when the high string is r, and have no step of less than<br/>233c or more than 700c.</p><p>Would you believe there are 65 of them. Email me if you want them.</p><p>Some can be eliminated because the overall range of the guitar would be too<br/>small. But that still leaves an awful lot. Can anyone suggest how could<br/>prune the list further?</p><p>Actually, everything we&apos;ve discussed so far relates equally to designing a<br/>Canasta (Miracle-31) guitar.</p><p>Eventually we have to decide what Blackjack chords (in what inversions) it<br/>is most important to be able to play, see what patterns they make on the<br/>fretboard with each open-string tuning, and decide whether we have enough<br/>fingers and can reach far enough.</p><p>If we can find a suitable open-string tuning that only ranges from r-3 to<br/>r+3, then here is the optimum arrangement of the frets. Spacings are given<br/>in 1/72nds of an octave. One octave is shown. The asterisk indicates the<br/>point of symmetry of the scale.</p><p>nut 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2*2 5 2 5 2 5</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2001 4:10:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So it ranges from r-3 ro r+5, a span of eight generators.

And I goofed there. A 7:10 is only 617 cents (not 633).</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; I thought of putting it around the major third from the nut.  Exactly<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; where depends on whether you prefer 5:4 to 9:7.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Please explain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s partly to match my meantone fretting, as explained in my reply to<br/>&gt; Paul.</p><p>Ok. I&apos;m not interested in meantone compatibility for a Blackjack guitar.</p><p>If your POS is that close to the nut, your current open string tuning must<br/>have an even bigger hole (or more holes) than the one I showed. i.e. notes<br/>missing between strings in the blackjack home key (if it were not the full<br/>31-EDO).</p><p>&gt; It wouldn&apos;t seem right to me for a<br/>&gt; guitar not to have a perfect fourth from the nut.</p><p>That&apos;s no problem.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think we only need to consider the string with the minimum value, r-3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t think this is correct.  You need to consider the strings with the<br/>&gt;maximum and minimum values, and make sure they can see each other.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by &quot;see each other&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Looks like your POS is a lot further down than mine.  But it should be<br/>&gt; possible to place that symmetrically about the tritone.  The closer it<br/>&gt; gets to the tritone, the more tunings should work by your criterion.<br/>&gt; It&apos;ll be something to do with the number of generators covered by the open<br/>&gt; strings, and the number you can move in either direction from the nut.</p><p>I disagree. This seems to be still ignoring gaps in the scale between strings.</p><p>Playing notes above the nut would be a neat trick! I know you didn&apos;t really<br/>mean that, but it&apos;s the fact that you can&apos;t do this that means the optimal<br/>POS will be as far down the neck as possible, with the constraint that for<br/>any string which is tuned a number of generators _less_ than the top<br/>string), all its missing notes must occur between the POS and the octave.</p><p>Any strings tuned a number of generators _more_ than the top string will<br/>have all their missing notes immediately above the POS (&quot;above&quot; here means<br/>towards the nut, not higher in pitch).</p><p>For example, if the minimum-generator string is an r-3 (as it is in your<br/>current tuning as well as the one I propose below) then there are 3 missing<br/>notes on this string and the POS should be 3 generators back towards the<br/>nut from the octave fret (which is &quot;above the nut&quot; in an octave-equivalent<br/>sense).</p><p>Then if the difference between max-gen string and min-gen string is only 5<br/>generators (as in the tuning below) the missing notes on the max gen string<br/>only come back 5 gens minus a sixth-tone, toward the nut from the octave<br/>fret. And since this max-gen string has an interval of 7:10 (an octave less<br/>5 gens) to the next string, then there is no gap in the home key. There is<br/>in fact a one note overlap, i.e. the pitch of the next open string can be<br/>duplicated on the previous string.</p><p>It might help to scroll down to the fingerboard diagram and look as where<br/>the &quot;*&quot;s are.</p><p>Note that this theory of optimum POS placement also implies that the first<br/>fret must be a small step (33c) away from the nut.</p><p>-------<br/>Theorem<br/>-------</p><p>If you want a 21-continuous-fret gap-free Blackjack guitar where the<br/>intervals between strings are never smaller than a neutral third (350 c)<br/>and never greater than a diminished fifth (617 c) then the open-string<br/>&quot;chord&quot; cannot span more than 7 generators.</p><p>-----------------------<br/>Partial Attempted Proof<br/>-----------------------</p><p>As described above, the critical factors for being gap-free are<br/>1. R, the range (in generators) of the open tuning, and<br/>2. M, the largest interval (in generators) between any max-gen string and<br/>the next string.</p><p>The first represents a problem that grows back from the octave fret and the<br/>second a problem that grows down from the nut. When these two problems<br/>overlap we get gaps in the scale.</p><p>With optimal POS placement, as per the above theory, the first missing note<br/>on the max-gen string is R generators minus a sixth-tone back from the<br/>octave fret.</p><p>An octave is 10 miracle generators plus a sixth-tone so the first missing<br/>note is 10-R generators plus 2 sixth-tones down from the nut. e.g. if R is<br/>5, 6 or 7 the first missing note is 5g+2s, 4g+2s or 3g+2s respectively from<br/>the nut.</p><p>Notice that M must be negative since it is only possible to go _down_ in<br/>generators from a max-gen string.</p><p>Given the size constraints, the available intervals between strings are:</p><p>Ratio Cents Abbr Gens<br/>---------------------<br/>9:11  350c  n3   +3g<br/>diss  467c  s4   +4g<br/>5:7   583c  sd5  +5g</p><p>7:10  617c  d5   -5g<br/>3:4   500c  P4   -6g<br/>4:5   383c  M3   -7g</p><p>So M must be -5g, -6g, or -7g.</p><p>So the note on the max-gen string that corresponds to the next open string,<br/>will be a distance of 10+M generators plus a sixth-tone down from the nut.<br/>i.e. it must be either 5g+s, 4g+s or 3g+s from the nut.</p><p>Notice that R must be greater than or equal to Abs(M) so we can see that<br/>the best cases are when M = -5 and R = 5, or M = -6 and R = 6, or M = -7<br/>and R = 7. In all of these cases you get to play the note of the next open<br/>string.</p><p>But it&apos;s not actually _that_ note we&apos;re worried about. We only want to be<br/>sure that we&apos;re not missing any notes _before_ that. Can we have for<br/>example M = -5 and R = 6. The answer appears to be &quot;Yes&quot; in this case.</p><p>I succumbed to brain-strain here, but thought I&apos;d post it anyway. Maybe<br/>someone else can help. If there&apos;s anything you don&apos;t follow, please ask.</p><p>----------------------<br/>A possible open tuning<br/>----------------------</p><p>The following combination of open string tuning and POS looks good to me on<br/>paper.
