If you look at the scale carefully, you&rsquo;ll realize that L+2S sounds like a very good minor third and that L+3S sounds like a very good major third, which means that 2L+5S sounds like a very good fifth. And because this scale tempers out (or turns into unison) the &bdquo;kleisma&ldquo; (i.e. the distance of a perfect twelfth minus 6 just minor thirds), then adding an octave (4L+7S) to this 2L+5S makes exactly 6 times the interval that I say sounds like a good minor third. Of course, this could never be done in temperaments like meantone or 12-equal, because they don&rsquo;t temper out the kleisma.

But don&apos;t forget that you can get hanson not only in<br/>&gt; 19-equal but also in 34-equal or 53-equal or whatever you want, similarly as<br/>&gt; you can get meantone in 19-equal and 31-equal and 50-equal and others. The<br/>&gt; general rule is that meantone tempers out the syntonic comma (i.e. the<br/>&gt; distance of four perfect fifths minus a just 5/1) while hanson tempers out<br/>&gt; the kleisma (i.e. the distance of a perfect twelfth minus six just minor<br/>&gt; thirds). -- Clear?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2009 11:55:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris wrote:</p><p>&gt; So what I think you are saying is that 19, 34, 53 equal can be used<br/>&gt; to approximately temper the kleisma by note/pitch selection?</p><p>Yes, see the second table on this webpage: <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2009 2:16:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yes, see the second table on this webpage: <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/e/equal-temperament.aspx</a></p><p>Oops, I meant the first table, of course.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2009 4:07:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To be honest - the information is not presented in a way the non-initiated<br/>can understand.</p><p>I sort of get the idea with the first graphic - but the table is... really<br/>hard to make any sense of.</p><p>I think I need to learn more by lurking some more.

The small steps happen to be around 68 or 69 cents. The major and minor thirds are within 4 cents of LucyTuning, although a couple notes in the 11-note scale may be around 10.5 - 11 cents away from the nearest LT note depending on the tuning of the generator.</p></div>
