I&apos;ve just been reading recently how the ancient<br/>&gt;&gt; Greeks (Pythagorists?) considered ratios (proportions) part<br/>&gt;&gt; of the order of the universe. Sounds good to me.</p><p>&gt; [zHANg, TD 690.18]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, the Hindus also believe this. As do Taoists as well.</p><p>As a complement to Dan Stearns&apos;s lengthy response to this,<br/>I&apos;d like to add that the earliest recorded music-theories<br/>that still exist all posit a deep connection between numbers,<br/>music, and cosmology.</p><p>It&apos;s evident that the Greeks got a lot of their musical,<br/>mathematical, mythological, and cosmological ideas from<br/>other great civilizations that preceeded them and with which<br/>they had some contact, most notably the Egyptians, but there<br/>is some evidence that some of their ideas came from Babylonia.</p><p>There&apos;s a great article by Ernest McClain, &apos;Musical Theory<br/>and Ancient Cosmology&apos;, which is on the web at:<br/><a href="http://members.aol.com/markalex9/Reviews/mcclain.html">http://members.aol.com/markalex9/Reviews/mcclain.html</a><br/>and which outlines  Babylonian music-theory, mathematics, and<br/>cosmology.</p><p>Another recent article which cites this one is Siemen Terpstra&apos;s<br/>&apos;A Short History of Just Intonation Tuning Culture&apos;, appearing<br/>in _1/1_ (the Journal of the Just Intonation Network),<br/>vol 10 no 1, Winter 1998.  I believe it is available online<br/>- check the JIN website.</p><p>McClain states that the Babylonians (who were presumably Semitic)<br/>took over almost all of the knowledge and beliefs of the Sumerians,<br/>who had been conquered centuries earlier by the Akkadians (also<br/>Semitic) and whose language had died out by that time.</p><p>The Sumerians were non-Semitic, and in fact their language<br/>has no known relatives anywhere on earth.  They are justly<br/>famous as the originators of the earliest surviving examples<br/>of writing.  I&apos;ve been stimulated by McClain&apos;s article, and by<br/>the fact that no one knows exactly who the Sumerians were,<br/>into doing more research on Sumerian math/music/religion, and<br/>have just gotten a copy of a book on &apos;Mespotamian Mathematics&apos;,<br/>in which I hope to find out more info on Sumerian music.<br/>I&apos;m also giving more credence to von Danakin&apos;s (_Chariots<br/>of the Gods_) theories these days.</p><p>Anyway, according to McClain, each Babylonian god was associated<br/>with a number in their base-60 numbering system.  The Babylonians<br/>used a base-60 system because 60 can be divided evenly so<br/>many different ways that they were thus able to deal with<br/>fractions to a fair degree of accuracy, including such<br/>quantities as:</p><p>50/60 = 5/6<br/>48/60 = 4/5<br/>45/60 = 3/4<br/>40/60 = 2/3<br/>36/60 = 3/5<br/>30/60 = 1/2<br/>24/60 = 2/5<br/>20/60 = 1/3<br/>15/60 = 1/4<br/>12/60 = 1/5<br/>10/60 = 1/6<br/>6/60 = 1/10<br/>5/60 = 1/12<br/>4/60 = 1/15<br/>3/60 = 1/20<br/>2/60 = 1/30</p><p>and of course other multiples of 10ths, 12ths, 15ths, 20ths, and<br/>30ths.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I agree with all of McClain&apos;s methods in reconstructing<br/>the Babylonian scales, but there is absolutely no doubt that<br/>if each god was associated with both a number and a musical<br/>proportion, then their music-theory was 5-limit, because 60<br/>factors into (2^2)*3*5.</p><p>The way I&apos;ve calculated the musical proportions, which I&apos;m<br/>assuming were being measured on a monochord, if the basic<br/>reference pitch of the entire string represents the whole<br/>unit of 60 parts (I&apos;ll call it &apos;A&apos; 1/1), then the whole pantheon<br/>of gods translated into musical ratios gives the following:<br/>(tick-marks and capital/lower-case indicate &apos;octaves&apos;)</p><p>  god     string-length = fraction  frequency-ratio  letter-name<br/>Bal/Marduk    10             1/6        6:1             e&apos;<br/>Nergal        12             1/5        5:1             c#&apos;<br/>Ishtar        15             1/4        4:1             a<br/>Shamash (sun) 20             1/3        3:1             e<br/>Sin (moon)    30             1/2        2:1             a<br/>Ea/Enki       40             2/3        3:2             E<br/>Enlil         50             5/6        6:5             C<br/>Anu/An        60             1          1:1             A&apos;</p><p>This gives a nice symmetrical set of pitches with a 3/2<br/>in the middle (representing the sun and moon), and with a<br/>5-limit &apos;major&apos; triad on top and 5-limit &apos;minor&apos; triad on<br/>the bottom.</p><p>McClain explains that as various rival cities assumed<br/>the position of supremacy in Mespotamian politics, the<br/>hierarchy in the pantheon of gods was altered so that<br/>those cities&apos;s local gods got their turn as supreme god.</p><p>Bal/Marduk, whose cult was centered in Babylon and who is<br/>associated with the number 10, became the &apos;chief god&apos; when<br/>Babylon became the greatest power in Mespotamia.  I find this<br/>especially interesting, because it seems (as suggested by McClain)<br/>that this happened at just the time that Mespotamian mathematics<br/>shifted away from a base-60 number system and to a base-10<br/>system, and it led to the Pythagorean theory of the (base-10)<br/>tetractys as the basis of all musical numbers:</p><p>       o<br/>      o o<br/>     o o o<br/>    o o o o</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
