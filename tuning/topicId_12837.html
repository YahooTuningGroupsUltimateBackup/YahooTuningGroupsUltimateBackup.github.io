Anthropologists in England (Cambridge<br/>University) are looking into the very real possibility that &quot;cavemen&quot;, as the radio programme<br/>reported, used pitches and rhythm to communicate , vocally and instrumentally,  before the<br/>constructs of human speech had been established. I&apos;m sorry that I don&apos;t have any references to<br/>the researchers as I gleaned this from a half -listened -to breakfast radio report by the<br/>BBC.  Some sort of early instruments with definite piches had been discovered and this led to<br/>the research.<br/>I just thought that this might provide some  relief for the list regulars in speculating what<br/>kind of scales early humanoids might haveused. Now wouldn&apos;t it screw things up for all of us<br/>if they found evidence of the use of 12-tet?</p></div><h3><a id=12851 href="#12851">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 1:08:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Alison Monteith wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12837">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12837</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anthropologists in England (Cambridge University) are looking<br/>&gt; into the very real possibility that &quot;cavemen&quot;, as the radio<br/>&gt; programme reported, used pitches and rhythm to communicate,<br/>&gt; vocally and instrumentally,  before the constructs of human<br/>&gt; speech had been established.</p><p>Hi Alison.  It&apos;s very interesting that you should post this<br/>today...  Jonathan Szanto was visiting with me today, and we<br/>were talking about the long period during which archaeologists<br/>say people were physically modern (i.e., able to speak) but<br/>unable to write anything down.  I&apos;ve posted on this recently;<br/>it was the period approximately 45,000 to 5,000 years ago.</p><p>I had the thought that perhaps the reason no-one thought<br/>of inventing writing was that maybe music played such an<br/>effective role in aiding memory (history would be formulated<br/>into long poetic epics, etc.) that that was sufficient.</p><p>Just another topic that merits further research... and an<br/>interesting coincidence, considering your post.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
