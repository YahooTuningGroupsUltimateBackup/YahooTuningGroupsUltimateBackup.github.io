Even when the other chord members are not<br/>present this combination of major thirds not only creates harmonic tension<br/>but actually _defines_ the tonality. (This characteristic only happens<br/>diatonically in that location in a major key.) That is why the functional<br/>tritone (whether sounded harmonically or, in this case, melodically) is so<br/>important to creating the musical energy in the major/minor system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In normal music, thirds are hidden away inside chords.  For virtually all<br/>&gt;&gt;music written since the demise of meantone, this is true.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uh?  What about melodies harmonized in thirds?  6ths are maybe more common,<br/>&gt; but....</p><p>Thirds and sixths are equally common. Note that one is the inversion of the<br/>other. It&apos;s the &quot;same thing&quot; upside down. Usually, however, melodies<br/>&quot;harmonized in thirds&quot; mix major and minor intervals that normally reinforce<br/>the tonality.</p><p>Supplied only for &quot;what it&apos;s worth.&quot; :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
