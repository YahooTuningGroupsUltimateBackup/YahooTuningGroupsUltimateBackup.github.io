Since<br/>&gt; Ibo said he thought there weren&apos;t split keyboards in France until quite a<br/>&gt; few years later than that, I thought people might be interested to see<br/>&gt; these diagrams. I scanned them and put them in the files area of<br/>&gt; yahoogroups, but the feature to create a new folder wasn&apos;t working, so I<br/>&gt; put them somewhere kind of random. They are here:</p><p>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/terrain/">/tuning/files/terrain/</a><br/>...</p><p>&gt; Ibo, you probably know these diagrams already and have some reason for<br/>&gt; thinking they were only theory, and that no organs actually existed in<br/>&gt; France like this? Mersenne seems very knowledgable about organ<br/>&gt; construction, and that part of the treatise is surely based on experience.</p><p>Thanks, for the pictures.<br/>(The 18-24-26 is mirrored vertically - already originally?)</p><p>Regarding that specific topic which I&apos;m writing about<br/>&quot;Organs with split keys fewer than 17 tones per octave&quot;<br/>the Mersenne-keyboard would fit into the range, even leading to enlarge<br/>the possible number again.<br/>One thing is that I&apos;m dealing with the development of this feature in<br/>the frame of pythagorean tuning and meantone temperament organs - in<br/>view of instruments, which really existed, which makes it somewhat<br/>difficult to include JI-keyboards, especially if we don&apos;t know, whether<br/>there were organs which had this kind of design (not only talking of the<br/>situation in France).</p><p>But do we know of any organ which had a keyboard like that?</p><p>The Mersenne-keyboards are JI-keyboards: the numbers on them indicate<br/>the ratios and two keys provide the numbers by which you can figure out<br/>the respective ratio.</p><p>Might be different in stringed keyboard-instruments, which were easier<br/>and much less costly to build and to (re-)tune for experiments.</p><p>I&apos;d be happy to recieve reports about France</p><p>&gt; By the way, did you know the Swedish composer Bengt Hambreus? - he had a<br/>&gt; great love and knowledge of historical organ design, and he oversaw the<br/>&gt; construction of a beautiful replica baroque organ in Montreal. I studied<br/>&gt; composition with him there for a couple of years, and he taught me lots<br/>&gt; about the organ.</p><p>I&apos;m not very much into this branch of contemporary music and I didn&apos;t<br/>know him personally, only heard a couple of pieces by him: I heard his<br/>composition for the inauguration of the Arp-Schnitger-organ in Hamburg,<br/>St.Jakobi, at that event Easter 1993, and a later composition for organ<br/>&quot;riflessioni&quot;. - but I know that he took great interest in our<br/>activities here. He was here at the Organ academy in 1998 (which I had<br/>to miss) and presented a lecture.</p><p>---------</p><p>&gt;    Date: Mon, 12 Mar 2001 21:18:36 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Joe Monzo, &quot;monz&quot;&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MONZ@JUNO.COM">MONZ@JUNO.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Draft 3 FAQ:  Organs with split keys fewer than 17 tones per octave</p><p>Interesting info, I didn&apos;t know about this - such a &quot;modern&quot; era for me :-)<br/>thanks!</p><p>...<br/>&gt; In July 1915, Willi Mo:llendorff</p><p>[was the spelling &quot;M&iuml;&iquest;&half;llendorf&quot;? as I find it in 3 different websites including<br/> <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a>]</p><p>&gt;  secured a patent for a unique<br/>&gt; quarter-tone keyboard which used the &quot;split-key&quot; idea.</p><p>&gt; He had a harmonium constructed with a keyboard which bore a<br/>&gt; great resemblance to the usual Halberstadt 7-white 5-black<br/>&gt; design, but with a row of brown keys which were placed in<br/>&gt; between each of the regular ones.</p><p>&gt; These brown keys were also &quot;split&quot;, in that they protruded<br/>&gt; from the surface of the white keys at the front and the back,<br/>&gt; but not in the middle.</p><p>I need to see a graphic or photo to understand how that works...</p><p>regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p></div><h3><a id=20162 href="#20162">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo, monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2001 1:11:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Ibo Ortgies &lt;ibo.ortgies@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20152.html#20152">/tuning/topicId_20152.html#20152</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;    Date: Mon, 12 Mar 2001 21:18:36 -0000<br/>&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Joe Monzo, &quot;monz&quot;&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Draft 3 FAQ:  Organs with split keys fewer<br/>&gt; &gt; than 17 tones per octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting info, I didn&apos;t know about this - such a &quot;modern&quot;<br/>&gt; era for me :-)<br/>&gt; thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; In July 1915, Willi Mo:llendorff<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [was the spelling &quot;M&ouml;llendorf&quot;? as I find it in 3 different<br/>&gt; websites including<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a>]</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s an umlaut on the &quot;u&quot;.
