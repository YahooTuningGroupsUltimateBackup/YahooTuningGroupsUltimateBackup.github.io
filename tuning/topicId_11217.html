However, I<br/>think the findings with regard to babies&apos; preferences for consonant<br/>frequency ratios can be explained quite readily in the framework of<br/>established psychoacoustical theory. First you have sensory roughness, the<br/>main factor considered in Sethares&apos; book, and the fact that with musical<br/>tones having ordinary, periodic waveforms (and hence harmonic overtones),<br/>simple frequency ratios will be the intervals of least sensory roughness.<br/>One could come up with many possible evolutionary reasons why sensory<br/>roughness could be linked with feelings of discomfort. Secondly, you have<br/>harmonic entropy, the degree of difficulty of fitting a stimulus into a<br/>harmonic series framework. Parncutt has postulated that familiarity with the<br/>harmonic series framework is acquired prenatally, through the mother&apos;s<br/>voice; other proposed mechanisms in which harmonic entropy would operate,<br/>including periodicity detection, could again have evolutionary origins.<br/>While music is of course a cultural construct and creates no evolutionary<br/>stresses on its own, the basic aesthetic characteristics of musical sounds<br/>could have some degree of universality. As another example, clothing is a<br/>cultural construct and yet the perception of certain fabrics being more<br/>comfortable than others is relatively universal . . .</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2000 3:39:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul!<br/>    Yes it would be nice if there was such a universality, but we are not so fortunate.<br/>Pleasing and unpleasant sounds are a result to a very large degree, cultural constructs.<br/>Otherwise i can only pity those that are subjected to the intervals of Pelog at an early age.<br/>I doubt this is the case and the same test done in Jakarta might result in the fifth as being<br/>perceived as unpleasant due to its lifelessness The only universality seems to be melody, that<br/>different tones are strung together as heard belonging together.
