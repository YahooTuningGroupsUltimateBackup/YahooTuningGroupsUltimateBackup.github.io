He said Partch never really explained this, but he theorized that<br/>&gt; it might have been because there would&apos;ve been available a G<br/>&gt; 392 Tuning Fork as a pre electronic tuning standard, also that he was<br/>&gt; a baritone, and the G at the bottom of the bass clef was probably a<br/>&gt; strong note at the bottom of his range. The latter intrigues me, in<br/>&gt; that this would almost imply that Partch was using this strong vocal G<br/>&gt; pitch, as a sort of &quot;1/1 Body Pitch&quot; (or the 1/1 of his singing voice)<br/>&gt; to which he made all of his instruments conform. Are there any other<br/>&gt; composers that post here, or that any of you know about that use such<br/>&gt; a &quot;Corporeal&quot; reason for choosing the 1/1 in a just intonation<br/>&gt; composition?</p><p>I think I remember reading somewhere that he chose G<br/>because it fit the range of his voice.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most of the time, out of convenience, I&apos;ll use concert &quot;C&quot; as the 1/1<br/>&gt; for pieces. There are also some benefits related to mapping tunings to<br/>&gt; a &quot;7 white - 5 black&quot; synthesizer keyboard, that make &quot;C&quot; a convenient<br/>&gt; choice. But when I did some tests of my voice in order to identify<br/>&gt; what my vocal 1/1 would be (singing with droning sine waves), I found<br/>&gt; that it was &quot;E&quot; (an interesting thing to find out after playing the<br/>&gt; guitar for over 20 years, since the 12 TET guitar&apos;s low string is E).<br/>&gt; Another interesting note about this too, is that &quot;C&quot; seems to be a<br/>&gt; difficult key for me to sing in, and feel natural doing it. But<br/>&gt; practicing along with a drone on E feels very natural. Any comments<br/>&gt; about the reasons why you might choose a particular 1/1 for your<br/>&gt; compositions?</p><p>I picked up on La Monte Youngs use of B=60 cycles, so A=426.7.<br/>All my 1/1s tend to be either E or A. All my raga lessons<br/>have been in B which just doesn&apos;t lay well on the guitar,<br/>although I&apos;m working on a 6 string slide tuning in B (sort<br/>of, I haven&apos;t thought about it in a while).</p><p>&gt; Another thing about Harry that I read somewhere, is that he would<br/>&gt; rarely combine more than 4 of his orchestral instruments together at<br/>&gt; once in a composition. I&apos;ve wondered if there could&apos;ve been some<br/>&gt; physical or aesthetic reason for this (or both). Perhaps it could&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been related to the overtone structures of the percussion instruments<br/>&gt; would not allow too much layering, or else the combined timbres might<br/>&gt; have clashed with one another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any thoughts?</p><p>Maybe he was only comfortable writing for a few instruments<br/>at a time? Makes good arranging sense to me.</p><p>Experts?</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
