Please let me emphasize that I<br/>comment on this article from my own medievalist point of view, and<br/>that someone looking at Salzer from a perspective of Schenkerian<br/>analysis might have other kinds of insights to contribute.</p><p>From my own viewpoint, I would say that Salzer&apos;s article is indeed<br/>open to some serious criticisms, but that many of these criticisms<br/>would apply also to more recent publications written after decades of<br/>further scholarship have revealed more about the practice and theory<br/>of Gothic music.</p><p>First, please let me give credit to Salzer on one very important<br/>point, despite his sometimes rather negative way of recognizing it: he<br/>regards Gothic polyphony as a &quot;modal-contrapuntal&quot; style quite<br/>independent of 18th-19th century &quot;harmony&quot; based on key progressions<br/>such as I-IV-V-I. He further recognizes what I term the complete trine<br/>(from Johannes de Grocheio&apos;s _trina harmoniae perfection_), in his<br/>term a sonority with fifth and octave or fourth and octave above the<br/>lowest part -- as the unit of stable sonority in this era.</p><p>Thus Salzer should not be numbered as among those theorists who regard<br/>13th-century verticality as a &quot;primitive&quot; or imperfect version of<br/>18th-century harmony. He specifically disclaims this view, and further<br/>emphasizes that although the three voices of a composition around 1200<br/>do not form key progressions, they do make up what he terms &quot;tonal<br/>organisms&quot; with idiomatic patterns of &quot;consonant and dissonant&quot;<br/>sonorities combining the separate voices.</p><p>When I read this article for the first time in 1968, it captured my<br/>attention as a lover of medieval polyphony, challenging me as it were<br/>to proceed further in exploring and appreciating the special patterns<br/>of this music.</p><p>In comparison, one can find what I consider much less comprehending<br/>approaches, Schenkerian and otherwise. The basic problem may be that<br/>analysts and historians often tend to approach this music from an<br/>explicit or implicit norm of 18th-century tonality, and to make<br/>judgments on that basis.</p><p>For example, one recent history of European music tells us that<br/>13th-century polyphony has a stable verticality based mainly on<br/>&quot;hollow&quot; sonorities -- that is, complete trines, the epitome of rich<br/>saturation in this era. It is added that &quot;full triads&quot; sometimes<br/>occur -- that is, relatively blending but unstable sonorities with<br/>outer fifth, major third, and minor third, the medieval _quinta fissa_<br/>or &quot;split fifth.&quot;</p><p>One might just as well write that Bach&apos;s stable harmony is defined by<br/>&quot;bare and simple triads,&quot; but that &quot;rich and sonorous seventh chords<br/>and added-sixth chords sometimes occur, inevitably leading however to<br/>a bare triad or the like.&quot; Imposing the aesthetics of 20th-century<br/>jazz, say, on 18th-century technique, seems to me no more or less<br/>arbitrary than imposing 18th-century aesthetics on 13th-century<br/>music.</p><p>When taken against this kind of background, much of Salzer&apos;s<br/>presentation can seem positively liberating. His project of seeking<br/>some form of &quot;tonal coherence&quot; in the most generic sense, based on<br/>principles other than the triads and key progressions of the 18th<br/>century, is itself most laudible.</p><p>Unfortunately, as Ervin Wilson might say, Salzer focuses on the<br/>&quot;non-18th-century&quot; character of the progressions -- but not very much<br/>on other possible patterns of vertical tension and relaxation between<br/>stable and unstable sonorities, for example at directed cadences. This<br/>omission is a real shortcoming of the analysis, although one might add<br/>that such critical sources as the complete Latin edition of the<br/>_Speculum musicae_ of Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325) were just becoming<br/>available when Salzer wrote.</p><p>Similarly, one finds a statement that 18th-century techniques such as<br/>&quot;deceptive cadences&quot; are unknown in this &quot;modal-contrapuntal&quot; style.<br/>Certainly, one might reply, _18th-century_ deceptive cadences are<br/>based on musical expectations which do not apply in this music. To<br/>approach the problem of whether some 13th-century equivalent of a<br/>&quot;deceptive cadence&quot; might occur -- a progression leading one to<br/>anticipate a decisive resolution where an inconclusive event in fact<br/>ensues -- we would want first to define a usual &quot;cadence.&quot;</p><p>Some of the pieces of Perotin dating around or slightly before 1200 which<br/>Salzer analyzes would indeed provide superb examples of such standard<br/>cadences, but unfortunately he notes the absence of 18th-century<br/>progressions without seeking out 13th-century progressions which might<br/>similarly lend a sense of drama and directed tension to the music.</p><p>(For a theoretical reference to what might be called a &quot;deceptive<br/>cadence,&quot; we have go just a bit beyond the 13th century, to Marchettus of<br/>Padua and his &quot;feigned color&quot; or deceptive cadential inflections described<br/>in 1318. This concept seems to me quite analogous to later ones, here<br/>with a basis in 14th-century rather than 18th-century vertical and melodic<br/>expectations.)</p><p>However, one effect of my exposure to Salzer&apos;s analysis, as I now look<br/>back on this encounter from a distance of 33 years, has been to whet<br/>my appetite for the recognition of such alternative patterns and<br/>paradigms.</p><p>Here I might add that Joseph Yasser&apos;s &quot;Medieval Quartal Harmony&quot; would<br/>during my following university years have much the same impact.<br/>Whatever my differences with Yasser&apos;s analysis -- and I have<br/>some strong ones -- his bold presentation of medieval European<br/>verticality as an integral system in its own right, and his drawing of<br/>connections with other world polyphonies based on stable fifths and<br/>fourths, would be germinal for me.</p><p>Of course, from the perspective of this Tuning List, the matter of<br/>intonation can make some of the qualities of Gothic polyphony more<br/>distinctive, and Vincent Corrigan&apos;s dissertation of 1980 on the Notre<br/>Dame conductus repertory includes a discussion of Pythagorean tuning<br/>which would help to prompt my eventual focus on this area.</p><p>In the field of musicology and analysis, one decade&apos;s omission is<br/>another decade&apos;s self-evident verity -- possibly regarded by a yet<br/>later decade as a questionable overgeneralization or theoretical<br/>overreaching. In art, as in science, paradigms change, but Salzer&apos;s<br/>article still evokes for me the excitement of the new even while<br/>reminding me that over the intervening 30 years and more, much water<br/>has flowed under the bridge.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
