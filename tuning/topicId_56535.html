While there can be a chromatic leading tone downward<br/>towards a tonic, it is more usual to have one pointing up to the tonic.<br/>Harmonically, this is done by the famed authentic cadence of a V chord resolving to a<br/>I chord.  The V chord&apos;s major third resolves upwards to the root of the I<br/>chord.</p><p>In the Romantic period and since the leading tone is sharpened melodically<br/>for the greatest possible tension.  In the Baroque period the leading tone<br/>travelled a greater distance before resolution.</p><p>Hope this helps.
