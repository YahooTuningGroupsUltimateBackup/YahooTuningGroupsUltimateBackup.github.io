For example, the arithmetic mean of length<br/>ratio 8/7 requires a bridge at 937.5 mm, and the geometric mean,<br/>a bridge at 935.4 mm;  here the difference is 2.1 mm.  Next, the<br/>arithmetic mean of length ratio 16/15 requires a bridge at 968.8<br/>mm, and the geometric mean, a bridge at 968.2 mm;  here the<br/>difference is only .6 mm.  However, because the arithmetic means<br/>represent rational numbers, and the geometric means represent<br/>irrational numbers, these two sets of numbers can never be<br/>identical.  Mathematicians refer to values or lines that converge<br/>but never meet or intersect as asymptotes.</p><p>******************************</p><p>Just/Rational Intonation, Tempered/Irrational Intonation, I don&apos;t<br/>think it really matters what you call it.
