Thats the whole point is that your guess<br/>&gt; is made before or without examination; not supported by factual study. Yes<br/>&gt;</p><p>Andy, I&apos;m sure you mean well, but what I am saying is not a hypothesis.  It<br/>is tested everything I have to sing a 5/4 in a Harry Partch Li Po.  The<br/>&quot;fact&quot; of the interval&apos;s accuracy is in the voice itself.  By studying<br/>overtone singing with David Hykes year&apos;s ago, I learned to produce the fifth<br/>harmonic by chanting on a tone and altering the harmonic emphasis.  The 5/4<br/>interval of 386 cents is IN the vocal tone.  There is no theory here, only<br/>practice.  Please feel free to check whatever you will like, but don&apos;t deny<br/>people their experiences due to incredulousness.  Hearing a 5/4 in advance<br/>and then accurately singing it is quite basic to singing microtonally.  It<br/>gets a lot harder after that.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
