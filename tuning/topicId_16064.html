There is discussion<br/>of that nature on this list, although several posters are intent on<br/>stressing the APPLICATION of the ideas to audible sound, which I<br/>appreciate.</p><p>However, perhaps one should not dismiss purely theoretical<br/>speculations &quot;out of hand...&quot;  Although they may not immediately make<br/>music, they may influence the creators who ultimately do...</p><p>As an important part of art in it&apos;s own right.... as Ms. Margo<br/>Schulter points out in her comments.

Subscribers to this List will probably &apos;get it&apos;<br/>better because they&apos;ll be familiar with what you&apos;re saying<br/>about these two particular composers (Partch and Grady).</p><p>As anyone who&apos;s ever looked at my webpages knows, visual art<br/>is an extremely important part of my tuning-theory work, and<br/>as anyone who&apos;s witnessed my performances of _A Noiseless<br/>Patient Spider_ will recognize, this visual art is most<br/>definitely finding its way into my recent compositions as well.</p><p>After reading John deLaubenfels&apos;s put-down:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16036">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16036</a></p><p>of Paul Erlich&apos;s put-down:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16033">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16033</a></p><p>of my ideas on this:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16028">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16028</a></p><p>I realized that maybe I backed down from Paul&apos;s contestation<br/>too easily in this post:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16039">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16039</a></p><p>Even tho, as I said, I agree with pretty much everything Paul<br/>said here, my more catholic attitude is well represented by John.</p><p>I think, Joe, that your invocation of Crumb&apos;s scores really<br/>drives the point home... I became fascinated with Crumb scores<br/>when I found them in the library at Manhattan School of Music,<br/>and it just so happened that there was a great interest in<br/>his music and many performances at that time (1979-81) at<br/>that school.</p><p>... And note that in _Spider_ I&apos;ve taken it one step further<br/>and actually let the audience in on the visual aspect.</p><p>For those who missed my presentation of this piece, the<br/>program notes are reproduced here:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/spider/spider.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/spider/spider.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;d also like to add that the pieces by Bill Alves which<br/>were given at this year&apos;s &apos;Microfest&apos; are a very interesting<br/>synthesis of computer audio and video.  Among them, IIRC,<br/>was _Static Cling_:</p><p><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/static.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/static.html</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div>
