You said:</p><p>&gt;The reason all that is ascribed to the brain&apos;s central pitch processor<br/>is that these &quot;harmonics&quot; can be presented some to one ear, some to the<br/>other, without ever changing the virtual-pitch effect. Roughness<br/>(&quot;sensory dissonance&quot; as discussed by Sethares), on the other hand,<br/>occurs only between tones presented to the same ear. This sensory<br/>dissonance accounts for a good deal of the consonance of otonal and<br/>utonal chords formed from complex harmonic tones.</p><p>Actually, sensory dissonance (roughness) can be heard when<br/>presented binaurally (one sine at each ear), but the perceived<br/>amplitude of the beating is considerably reduced from when it is<br/>presented monaurally. You can hear this effect on tracks 9 and 10 of<br/>the CD accompanying TTSS. In 9 the two sines are mixed dead center<br/>while in track 10 one is panned to the left and the other to the right.<br/>You can hear the roughness in both cases, but with noticeably<br/>different strengths.</p><p>This may be at the heart of why sensory dissonance is so hard to pin<br/>down - its not one phenomenon, but two separate phenomena<br/>entangled with each other. There is the part that occurs in the &quot;ear&quot;<br/>(this is probably due to a nonlinear rectification by the hair cells on<br/>the basilar memnbrane) and there is the part that occurs in the<br/>&quot;higher centers&quot;. The former is likely the primary constituent of the<br/>monaural perception, while the latter (very analogous to combination<br/>or difference tones) is the root of the binaural sensation.</p><p>There was an excellent paper a while ago (July 1981) in the Am J of<br/>Physics by Don Hall called &quot;The difference between difference tones<br/>and rapid beats&quot; that talked about this at length.</p></div><h3><a id=930 href="#930">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/1999 5:19:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Actually, sensory dissonance (roughness) can be heard when<br/>&gt; presented binaurally (one sine at each ear), but the perceived<br/>&gt; amplitude of the beating is considerably reduced from when it is<br/>&gt; presented monaurally.

Slow beating, for example, is<br/>normally associated with very little roughness; maximum roughness occurs<br/>at about 25% of the critical bandwidth regardless of the rate of beating<br/>(which will depend on register), and for high-frequency tones separated<br/>by, say, two-thirds of a critical bandwidth, all you have is roughness<br/>-- the beating is just too fast to perceive. I&apos;ve played with binaural<br/>beats but would you say they are associated with roughness?</p><p>&gt;There was an excellent paper a while ago (July 1981) in the Am J of<br/>&gt;Physics by Don Hall called &quot;The difference between difference tones<br/>&gt;and rapid beats&quot; that talked about this at length.</p><p>The title of this article is a different confusion that people often<br/>have. People often assume that that any sonic phenomenon with a<br/>frequency in the audible range will produce the tone normally associated<br/>with that frequency. This is not the case, as even a naive mathematical<br/>understanding of wave phenomena will make clear.</p></div>
