Because of the size of<br/>this issue and the fact that my time is rather limited these days, I<br/>printed only enough copies for the contributors and myself. However,<br/>copies will be available from Frog Peak Music, P.O. Box 1052, Lebanon,<br/>NH 03766,<br/>and on the WEB at <a href="http://www.frogpeak.org/">http://www.frogpeak.org/</a> .</p><p>Frog Peak Music, &quot;A Composers&apos; Collective,&quot; was founded as by Larry<br/>Polansky and Jody Diamond when they were at Mills College in the 1980s<br/>and subsequently accompanied them when they moved to Dartmouth. Among<br/>its first publications were James Tenney&apos;s &quot;Meta-Hodos&quot; and my<br/>&quot;Divisions of the Tetrachord.&quot; Frog Peak also sells an extensive set of<br/>CD&apos;s of experimental music, including microtonal and xenharmonic, in<br/>addition to books and scores. Check them out..</p><p>--John</p></div>
