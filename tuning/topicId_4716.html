Would anyone let me know what of<br/>&gt; these scales people are using, and what properties of structure are enjoyed<br/>&gt; about them?</p><p>Not quite understanding the question, I&apos;ll first throw out some well<br/>known scales which have three step sizes (major, minor and augmented<br/>seconds)</p><p>1  2 b3 4 5 b6 7 8        harmonic minor<br/>1 b2 3  4 5 b6 7 8         etc<br/>1 b2 3 #4 5 b6 7 8         etc</p><p>and there are other variations on this idea.</p><p>A potential tuning for the first that keeps things to 3 step sizes<br/>(without going into your equivalence classes) is</p><p> 9/8   28/27  9/8   9/8   28/27   243/196     28/27<br/>1   9/8    7/6   4/3   3/2    14/9       27/14     2/1</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So my other questions are: what J.I. scales (any cardinality) of greater<br/>&gt; complexity might be used (or &quot;do you use&quot;) to &quot;approximate&quot;, in that meaning<br/>&gt; I just explained, a scale of three-step-sizes? So I look for J.I. scales</p><p>but a more traditional treatment would be</p><p> 9/8   16/15   9/8   10/9   16/15   75/64    16/15<br/>1   9/8     6/5   4/3    3/2     8/5     15/8     2/1</p><p>where the 9/8 and 10/9 fall into an equivalence class. Does the augmented<br/>second fall into a compound equivalence class like in 12tet?</p><p>&gt; And lastlly, a general question: have models been proposd, who describe, and<br/>&gt; explain a rationale for, this kind of equivalenceing of different J.I.<br/>&gt; intervals into classes?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I should think this is similar if not identical to some of the stuff<br/>that gets talked about here all the time.</p><p>Where is it that you are going here, and do you have any suggested<br/>scales that have interesting properties that you are dealing with?</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Paul H.
