It seemed a good<br/>starting point.<br/>    I was hoping to put up a composition Lullaby   that goes from the most<br/>consonance inversions to the most dissonant over a 30min. time. (This piece will<br/>be up as soon as break the code of a few problems, a few days). I wrote for my<br/>daughter to play to her when she was first born to expose her these sounds before<br/>the 12et matrix got a hold of her.More on this later. Having tried a few formulas<br/>over the preceeding 3 years, the best one seem to be   adding up the harmonic<br/>analysis of each chord, plus the first order differance tones, omitting any<br/>duplications of unisons. Each chord is then given a number. At the time, I could<br/>guess exactly what number would make my girl friend really tense. It became a<br/>game and was pretty consistent no matter how i snuck up on it. We would laugh.<br/>Anyway when this gets put up people could try as see if they agree or not or if<br/>those around them have the same threshold!</p><p>Here is what I don&apos;t like or question about this system though.<br/>1) Are the numbers abitrary? for instance is 7 , 2 and a 1/3 more dissonant than<br/>3,  or is 4 four times more dissonant than 1? I thought of the square root of<br/>each, but in the end, the order would remain the same.Try it<br/>2) As you would say, the number of the subharmonic versions seems to be higher<br/>than the percieved dissonance. Possibly  including the first 12 partials of each<br/>tone of a chord (or determined by actual timbre) might be added which might<br/>balance this out with the subharmonic chords having a high coincidence of higher<br/>harmonics (coinciding with combination tones). Ideally the the difference tones<br/>could be determined by their presence in volume. Maybe with louder sounds the<br/>secound order differance tones would have to be included.etc.<br/>3. Range and timbre are not included.<br/>4. as Ernst Toch pointed out, disonance is often determined by context. with an<br/>f# Major chord sounding pretty dissonant in a C pan-diatonic piece.</p><p>    Put side by side, otonalities seem more consonant than their subharmonic<br/>counterparts. Regardless, much is lost in treating all inversions as equally<br/>con/dis. Helmholz steered us away from this i thought.<br/>Musically though the U&apos;s, have a depth and completeness,while the O&apos;s maybe more<br/>simple and perfect. With 12et I always preferred the minor chord so it is no<br/>suprise my preference for subharmonics.</p><p>&gt; With metallophone timbres such as the ones Kraig uses, utonal<br/>&gt; chords don&apos;t have any consonance-maximizing properties, while otonal chords<br/>&gt; have plenty (due to difference tones, other combination tones, virtual<br/>&gt; pitches, and the interactions between all these). Wilson&apos;s CPS scales tend<br/>&gt; to favor otonal and utonal chords equally; of course, one can use these<br/>&gt; scales and treat the utonal chords as dissonances; but then why not use more<br/>&gt; otonally-based scales, which are bound to contain plenty of resources for<br/>&gt; dissonance anyway? (I think Kraig is about to describe such scales for us,<br/>&gt; as well as their utonal versions.)</p><p>I hope to put i up my Xenharmonikon  article on the CPS&apos;s. A small point though,<br/>Wilson does not concider the CPS&apos;s as scales but as harmonic constructs. He uses<br/>the term scale only in reference to a melodic construct as outlined in his Moment<br/>of Symetries.</p><p>As the CPS&apos;s shine best when used in a non tonic  context, the arrangment of<br/>harmonies based on tension and release is less advantagious. It seems that a<br/>certain contrast of con/dis  is necessary for it to be percieved in a meaningful<br/>way. It is no wonder that the seventh was added to the dominant to heighten this<br/>contrast.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/1999 8:12:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Wilson&apos;s CPS scales tend to favor otonal and utonal chords equally;</p><p>Only for CPS&apos;s where k:n is 1:2 are otonal and utonal resources equal.
