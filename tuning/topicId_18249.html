I proved non periodicity<br/>for a set of four tiles -  two colourings of the oblate and two of the prolate<br/>golden rhombohedron (this result is not published, and seemed to be unproved<br/>when I started on it, but I imagine someone else will surely have proved it by now<br/>- the set of four tiles was well known at the time I was doing the main research).</p><p>For the 2D work, I started by cutting out tiles + drawing coloured lines<br/>on them, and eventually wrote a program to generate the tilings.</p><p>Perhaps my best (unpublished) result is the proof of non periodicity of<br/>a set of tiles that makes tilings with seven fold symmetry, including this tiling:<br/><a href="http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/robert/7g2o7detail.htm">http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/robert/7g2o7detail.htm</a></p><p>- they were also discovered previously by Soccolar, but he didn&apos;t<br/>prove non periodicity - as a crystallogropher, he would be more interested in proving<br/>crystallographic results. I don&apos;t know whether or not anyone else has proved<br/>non periodicity for them yet.</p><p>Some day, would be nice to set some time aside and complete a few<br/>of those papers. But I seem to be getting more and more interested<br/>and involved in musical activities nowadays!</p><p>Maybe one day will go back to it again, who knows,...</p><p>However there is so much of mathematical interest in scales and tunings too.<br/>So not really in any hurry to do so (unless perhaps someone else is _very_<br/>keen to see the results).</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
