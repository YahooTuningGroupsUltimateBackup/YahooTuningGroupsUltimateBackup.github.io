Since there&apos;s a class for representing intervals<br/>in general, of course, meantone intervals can be represented;  I just<br/>hadn&apos;t worked out how to make a class to generate them by parameter.</p><p>&gt;&gt;My list of intervallic tuning paradigms was never meant to be exhaustive.<br/>&gt;&gt;I represent intervals in a very general way, as fuzzy quantities of pitch<br/>&gt;&gt;distance.  The classes in the section you&apos;re looking at are just examples<br/>&gt;&gt;of handy ways to produce interval objects by parameter.</p><p>&gt;So perhaps meantone would fall under the Pythagorean umbrella?</p><p>Maybe, let me see, maybe the parameters would look like this:<br/>n=number of &quot;fifths&quot; to transpose upward,<br/>f=the interval we call a &quot;fifth&quot; (it could be anything),<br/>t=the target interval we&apos;re trying to approximate.<br/>Then the interval generated would be f+(t-f*n)/n?<br/>Optionally it could return the temper itself, (t-f*n)/n?</p><p>&gt;&gt;a formula for generating?</p><p>&gt;Sure -- there are a number of possibilities. For example, one can run<br/>&gt;a least-squares optimization on the three errors: the deviation of<br/>&gt;the fifth itself from 3:2, the deviation of the major sixth generated<br/>&gt;by three such fifths (minus an octave) from 5:3, and the deviation of<br/>&gt;the major third generated by four such fifths (minus two octaves)<br/>&gt;from 5:4. The result is 7/26-comma meantone temperament (Woolhouse<br/>&gt;1835), i.e. (3/2)*(80/81)^(7/26).</p><p>So, the parameters might be:<br/>f=the &quot;fifth&quot;<br/>c=the &quot;comma&quot;<br/>x=the amount of comma to temper.<br/>So the generated interval would be f*c^x?<br/>That seems less natural and interesting than the above.</p><p>What would you suggest?</p><p>-m<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/17/2001 4:07:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Maybe, let me see, maybe the parameters would look like this:<br/>&gt; n=number of &quot;fifths&quot; to transpose upward,<br/>&gt; f=the interval we call a &quot;fifth&quot; (it could be anything),<br/>&gt; t=the target interval we&apos;re trying to approximate.</p><p>t is redundant, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>As I see it, meantone is nothing more than a variation of<br/>Pythagorean, where the fifths are uniformly flattened by a fraction<br/>(typically 1/3 to 1/6) of a comma, in order to get much-improved<br/>thirds and sixths.
