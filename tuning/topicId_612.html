In addition, you can get your local Tower to carry your CD, but<br/>they won&apos;t carry it at all the other stores.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=635 href="#635">ðŸ”—</a>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;skyfyre@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/1999 11:12:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jeff,</p><p>I&apos;ve got a line on Ogur. Found someone on the net who knows him<br/>and got an e-mail for someone who should be able to tell me how<br/>to get in touch with him.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to buy any of his CDs, you can find them<br/>on the web. Just do a search for him. Almost everything that<br/>turns up is in Turkish (which I don&apos;t understand), though,<br/>so maybe you can e-mail and ask for info.</p><p>I found a listing (with a real audio sample, which I haven&apos;t heard)<br/>for &quot;Erkan Ogur - Eskiya&quot; at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.turknet.com/music/cdguide/index.html">http://www.turknet.com/music/cdguide/index.html</a>&gt;</p><p>And there&apos;s a page for this here (all Turkish)<br/><a href="http://sinema.tr-net.net.tr/movies/eskiya/cast/erkan_ogur.htm">http://sinema.tr-net.net.tr/movies/eskiya/cast/erkan_ogur.htm</a></p><p>&gt; I too have heard of Erkan.
