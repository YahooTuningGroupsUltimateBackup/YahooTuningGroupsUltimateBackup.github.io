And I have absolutely no idea where I could have downloaded it back in 2008 if it appears to be actually newer than the copy on Graham&apos;s website. :-) And if there really IS a newer version of Primerr, Graham, are there some &quot;quotable&quot; differences as compared to the one from March 14th?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=83563 href="#83563">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2009 4:40:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Graham or anyone who think might have something to say here,<br/>&gt; &gt; recently, I was walking through various documents on Graham&apos;s website.

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve even compiled it again since then.  If you have one that looks newer, it must mean I had the date set wrong on my computer, or you&apos;re mis-reading it.</p><p>All the &quot;finished&quot; ones have a change log at the back saying how they differ from the last version of the year of the rat.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
