I believe Lydia Ayers was one of the first to<br/>compose on this scale. Anyway having my first pump organ and a beginner in the<br/>70&apos;s, I needed  a scale for ear training. This scale had more properties than<br/>most. Remember that lattices are bias to the harmonic properties at the expense<br/>of the melodic.Scale construction seems best when both are taken into<br/>concideration!
