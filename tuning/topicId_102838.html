The scale is stretched octave, 1207.815 cents; open string length: 650 mm. The first fret is positioned at 613.3 mm, measured from the lower bridge, the twelft fret, at 323.5 mm, equal tempered.</p><p>Three good performers of the guitar played this instrument, they also played other two standard concert guitars. Before the evaluations, the performers were not informed about the stretched octave scale used in one guitar which was constructed with common wood. At the end, both performers remarked the bright sound of the stretched guitar after playing many classical pieces.</p><p>Saying my truth, this interesting experience, based on a subject that didn&acute;t progress in tuning, differs from the disconcerting harmony I listen on microtonal pieces. It seems that the subject of musical octave keeps some definitions to be known. In parallel, the intense analyses that a group of members do to perfect a very complex set of subjects is remarkable.</p><p>Mario</p><p>January, 14</p></div>
