Erlich derived it<br/>from the work of van Eck.</p><p>Minima refer to areas along the &quot;octave&quot;<br/>pitch-space where harmonic entropy is at a low<br/>point, meaning that there is one interval most<br/>likely to be perceived as the heard interval.<br/>The area around 3:2 is a good example.</p><p>The maxima, conversely, refer to areas along<br/>the &quot;octave&quot; pitch-space where many ratios of<br/>roughly the same numerical complexity all have<br/>about the same probability of being perceived<br/>as the heard interval.  The area around 16:15<br/>is a good example, because all the superparticular<br/>ratios between approximately 21:10 and 15:14<br/>(I&apos;m totally guestimating here, but you get the idea)<br/>sound roughly the same and could be mistaken for<br/>one another (disregarding any other cues given<br/>by any musical context).</p><p>These high and low points occur because the complexity<br/>of the numbers in ratios varies within the &quot;octave&quot;<br/>in an uneven way, with smallest numbers having the<br/>largest Field of Attraction or probability.  Because<br/>larger numbers both have smaller fields and are closer<br/>together, we are less able to pinpoint one ratio from<br/>among several of them.</p><p>Carl Lumma, John Chalmers, and myself all think<br/>that Erlich has formulated an important aspect of<br/>musical harmony and tuning here.</p><p>[Mulkers:]<br/>&gt; I have a strange feeling you&apos;re<br/>&gt; touching here some ideas that are mine as well.</p><p>If you&apos;re right - sorry,<br/>didn&apos;t mean to touch without asking permission first  8-)</p><p>[Mulkers:]<br/>&gt; Actually, two tones don&apos;t fit because they &quot;behave&quot; like<br/>&gt; overtones, It&apos;s because of the fitting overtones themselves.</p><p>It&apos;s both, and more.  Helmholtz&apos;s beating, which<br/>is what the &quot;fitting overtones&quot; avoid doing, is one<br/>part of the sonance model, but it may not be as<br/>important as either harmonic entropy, tonalness,<br/>or integer/odd/prime-complexity. They all play a part.<br/>The one thing that seems to tie them all together<br/>is the *model* of the overtone series.</p><p>In the post you quoted, I said:</p><p>[Monzo:]<br/>&gt; Would the minima describe a subset of the<br/>&gt; harmonic series that is the determinant of<br/>&gt; the most likely implied fundamental of<br/>&gt; &quot;tonalness&quot;?</p><p>The fact I am assuming is that the harmonic series<br/>is a kind of psycho-acoustical template that we<br/>use to understand musical harmony, and that we<br/>try to fit what we hear to it, even if the match<br/>is not perfect [= just].</p><p>I purposely worded it the way I did to remain non-specific,<br/>so that my proposition could also be expanded to include<br/>notes that are possibly acting as xenharmonic bridges<br/>among the prime-factors.</p><p>Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy works for dyadic intervals,<br/>but no one has yet figured out how to apply the idea to<br/>chords, to describe the consonance/dissonance of<br/>triads, tetrads, and higher-ads.</p><p>I believe that finding some mathematical way of<br/>combining dyadic harmonic entropy with the ideas of:</p><p>1) &quot;tonalness&quot; (where simultaneous notes tend to<br/>imply some harmonic series, and thus some fundamental)</p><p>and</p><p>2) the integer/odd/prime-complexity idea</p><p>is the solution to calculating both the sonance<br/>of chords, and the finity/periodicity of harmonic<br/>systems.  Lattice diagrams are a tremendous aid<br/>in visualizing these processes.</p><p>I also believe that xenharmonic bridging is going<br/>on all the time while we listen to music - that<br/>intervals and pitches of one prime-factorization<br/>are able to substitute, and in varying degrees<br/>(depending on composer, performer, listener, etc.)<br/>*are* substituting for those of other prime-factors.<br/>(lattices model this well too)</p><p>But this is a very complex, fluid, and subjective<br/>process.  I think it possibly involves the way<br/>different areas of the brain process different<br/>information.</p><p>-Monzo</p><p>** I have a new version of the harmonic entropy<br/>webpage ready to go on the web, complete with<br/>graphs and a commentary thru-out, based on an<br/>explanation Erlich gave me in person.

It disagreed on the filenames so I renamed the files. 1 and 3<br/>swapped numbers and unnumbered became 4. This is a more logical order. It<br/>corresponds to the order in which you described them to the list. I don&apos;t<br/>suppose it matters since each chart is well labelled internally.</p><p>Anyway, you can now just go to <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>P.S.
