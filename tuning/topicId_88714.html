Sure it can do UN-clustered minor seconds in inversions of the 7th and such and make them sound relatively consonant...but that&apos;s not the point, the point is with clustered minor seconds.</p><p>   Hence why I am discussing other ways to tune that make something nearly as clustered as three consecutive minor seconds IE &quot;C C# D&quot; sound about as consonant as a series of chained major seconds in 12TET (such as the chain of major seconds used in the Cadd2 chord).<br/>   IMVHO if 12TET could do that...there would be no point in exploring other scales to make a chord fairly like that possible...especially since 12TET does a fine job with most common-practice intervals.</p><p>   Same goes with my other example of using 11/6 instead of the 15/8 estimate in 12TET...you can&apos;t do an 11/6 interval in 12TET and yet the consonance obtained by 11/6 is similar or better than that obtained by 15/8.  So you get a new type of &quot;7th&quot; sound with virtually no loss in consonance compared to the &quot;common practice theory standard&quot; 7th of 15/8.</p><p>     Again let me revert to this: I believe 12TET sounds FINE with common practice theory intervals for the most part.  It&apos;s a great option for people who want to use those intervals and related chords...and only those intervals and related chords.</p><p>     Why I&apos;m looking into alternative scales has to do with handling of intervals like 12/11 (which sounds about as consonant as a 12TET major second) and 11/6 (which sounds about as consonant or a bit better than a 12TET major 7th) has to do with unlocking fresh new chords without losing 12TET-like consonance.   And yet Chris seems to be pushing the idea of &quot;there&apos;s nothing to be fixed...12TET covers all combinations of consonant intervals, including &apos;consonant tone clusters with all intervals involved closer than the major 2nd&apos;.</p></div><h3><a id=88728 href="#88728">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 1:08:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just a general comment so far as &quot;how clustered a chord can you get in 12TET without sounding uncommonly dissonant&quot;...<br/>   What do you think of the &quot;chords&quot; of BCF, BCDF, and BCDE?<br/>    My hunch is that those, even when they don&apos;t contain consecutive minor 2nds, are still far too dissonant to be heard as &quot;normal&quot; chords...to me they represent another gray area of chords too clustered to be made possible as consonant in 12TET...that poses an opportunity so far as something that can be made possible with alternative tunings.</p><p>  Note I think &quot;BCE&quot; is perhaps the one exception far in 12TET as a clustered chord (and or part of a larger chord) that actually sounds relatively OK in 12TET...but that&apos;s really just part of an inversion on the major 7th chord of CEGB.

My point is that while you can&apos;t just improve music by randomly tell composers &quot;get better at composing, practice more!!&quot; and magically get fresh music (especially if they are already practicing and reading a ton), you do have a fair chance of actually improving a musician&apos;s ability by giving them easier to handle tunings.  You seem to be indirectly trying to say &quot;we need to demand that composers get better rather than improve tunings&quot;.  You&apos;re trying to optimize a somewhat non-modifiable variable in creating &quot;good&quot; music.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What I would like is:<br/>1) the ability to transpose<br/>2) the ability to<br/>modulate<br/>3) variety in chord quality (like major vs minor vs maj 7th ver min 7th vs 9th etc. etc.)<br/>4) be capable of melodies.&quot;</p><p>1) Transposition is an admitted weakness of any scale that does not fit well into or closely match a TET tuning, and not just my scales.  I&apos;m not going to argue, 12TET, 17TET and a whole bunch of other tunings have scales under them which automatically have a significant advantage in that vs. my scales, for example.  Then again, you might as well argue many of Erv Wilson&apos;s well established MOS scales and other scales that don&apos;t fit well into TETs are bad on those grounds.  The other thing is...you can &quot;transpose&quot; electronically by pitch-shifting so long as you plan on using a soft-synth or fully electronic instrument or even on acoustic instruments using fret-less instruments like violins.</p><p>2) Modulation is possible under my scales and many other non-TET.  Sure you may get an 11/8 instead of a 7/5 using the same chord in different keys with a different root tone, for example...but most of the intervals are still fairly uniform across the board.<br/>3) Far as variety in chord quality, virtually all scales I&apos;ve proposed have more variety than 12TET.  You get substitutes for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th...but you also get slight variants of the substitutes as described in #2.<br/>4) What on earth does &quot;be capable of melodies&quot; mean?  Perhaps it means that 12TET-style melodies or melodies along 12TET-style intervals within other tunings are somehow the only ones truly valid as melodic or expressive?<br/>    This seems to be a completely subjective measure.  Considering you have 7 unique and well spaced tones in my latest scale and many other systems quite different from 12TET you have as much melodic flexibility as you do in diatonic scales under 12TET.  So it&apos;s at least as flexibility, if not also capable of your seemingly arbitrary measure of what makes a scale melodic.</p></div><h3><a id=88738 href="#88738">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 4:27:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, May 5, 2010 at 5:11 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&quot;What is &quot;uncommonly&quot; dissonant?&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; Something you can give a listener<br/>not on this list or with previous micro-tonal experience and have them<br/>take it seriously.&nbsp;&quot;</p><p>&quot;&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; &quot;My point is that while you can&apos;t just improve<br/>music by randomly tell composers &quot;get better at composing, practice<br/>more!!&quot; and magically get fresh music (especially if they are already<br/>practicing and reading a ton), you do have a fair chance of actually<br/>improving a musician&apos;s ability by giving them easier to handle<br/>tunings.&nbsp; You seem to be indirectly trying to say &quot;we need to demand<br/>that composers get better rather than improve tunings&quot;.&nbsp; You&apos;re trying<br/>to optimize a somewhat non-modifiable variable in creating &quot;good&quot;<br/>music.&quot;</p><p>=&gt; Have you not pondered why people hold Beethoven or Mozart or Bach<br/>or Debussy or Copland in such high esteem as composers?

Go to xenharmonic and read what Igs wrote.</p><p>Here about 15 edo</p><p>&quot;Of course, the guitar solo at the end is the most f&apos;d-up sounding<br/>solo I&apos;ve ever played...15 is kind of tough to solo in because it<br/>lacks a true major second (the whole-tone at 160&cent;, a near 11/10, just<br/>doesn&apos;t cut it!), but the chords sound so nice and normal that the<br/>weird melodic structure clashes really hard. But just think of what<br/>Sonic Youth could do with 15-EDO guitars....&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t find it - perhaps it was a post to tuning - Igs says he found<br/>16 edo to be the opposite - bad for chords but good for melodies.</p><p>BUT these are not absolutes and the opinion of one composer.

Composers will always have the challenges of good arrangements, catchy themes...ahead of them they will need to practice regardless of what tuning/scale-system they use. And  I figure why not at least level down the challenge of things like finding good chords (via making new scales optimized for this) so they can concentrate and practicing other aspects of music and make more progress.  Doing otherwise it a bit like architects&apos; trying to build houses with termites hidden in certain pieces of wood....even without the termites only some will become great builders...but what&apos;s the use of testing their ability to &quot;get rid of the termites&quot; along with all their other challenges (it certainly won&apos;t help make the best few houses of all the ones the architects build any better artistically).</p></div><h3><a id=88745 href="#88745">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 7:08:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael, quite frankly.</p><p>You seem to be bent on creating a &quot;song smith &quot; tuning because that<br/>will somehow solve all problems.</p><p>The problem a composer faces with composition is NOT selecting chords<br/>or even creating a melody.

However, I know the major point where *I* disagree with Michael is in the idea that an all-consonant scale will be ideal for composition.  I think the best music I&apos;ve heard is great because of the interplay of consonance and dissonance, and that just as &quot;good&quot; is often said to need &quot;evil&quot; in order to exist, consonance needs dissonance in order to be effective musically.</p><p>I turned to microtonality in part because I found 12-tET to be too lacking in interesting dissonances, and I think one has to work mighty HARD in 12-tET to make dissonant music...look at all the trouble the serialists went through!  In 12-tET, there are really only two dissonances: the tritone and the minor second, and even those can sound perfectly consonant in many different contexts.  As Michael says, clusters of multiple consecutive minor seconds are dissonant in 12-tET, and they&apos;re really about the ONLY way to achieve dissonance in that tuning...IMHO, that&apos;s not a very interesting way to go about making dissonance.</p><p>What I like about my favorite scales (though I don&apos;t expect anyone else to like them as much as I do) is that they locate dissonance in unusual but interesting places, so that familiar intervals get recontextualized.  For me, the &quot;perfect scale&quot; would absolutely NOT be one devoid of dissonance, but one wherein the dissonances are placed exactly where I want them (wherever that might be), and wherein the consonances take a little bit more work to really bring out.  It would be a scale that FORCES me to think, not one that quantizes even the most banal compositions into a pristine and polished jewel.  For of course such a dissonance-free scale would be an unavoidable equalizer among composers.  There has to be some measure of challenge to music, or else what is to distinguish the masters from the amateurs?  When any note can be combined just as well with any other, how is one to choose notes effectively?</p><p>Though of course whether Michael has actually produced the scale he is seeking is another matter entirely, but I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not too interested in that (given my staunch disagreement with the philosophical underpinnings of his quest).</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris&gt;&quot;You seem to be bent on creating a &quot;song smith &quot; tuning because that will somehow solve all problems.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Quite the opposite.

To see music only this way is rather limited. Music can exist<br/>even without a melody, without chords, or both, and still it will be  called music.&quot;<br/>    True, but how common is it for people worldwide to like said kind of music?   Another way to say it...If it were so popular why are we stuck with 12TET as king other than it&apos;s supposed harmonic and melody capabilities?   Personally I&apos;ve seen things like a group called Juju Nation (an African Orchestra...literally) and often they&apos;ll go songs focusing on nothing but phrasing of sounds and drums (albeit with some amazing poly-rhythms)...and to me they&apos;re great but in reality they can barely make a living off music nor have I in any other case heard of a local group playing rhythm-only music.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Random process and chance can be used as a  part of compositional language, but on higher level it&apos;s only logical  part of composition, not the main principle.&quot;<br/>  Right...and that&apos;s exactly what the program did.   Kept to the main theory for the most part and added just enough randomness on the side to make it human.  And when I say randomness I don&apos;t mean just throwing in random notes, but throwing in anything, even with a very logical path, which in some way deviates from the composers usual style.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Scale system or tuning itself will not improve the composer, just  widen his material and inspire. &quot;<br/>   If I get it right though...what you&apos;re saying isn&apos;t much different from what I was implying.  That is...the idea the scales and tuning gives more options for chords and melody...two of the key things that inspire many if not most musician...and such options are likely to entice/inspire the composer to do something both great and completely fresh/new.  The odd thing about the program above (not Song Smith obviously...but the one that composed in emulated styles of Bach, Beethoven, etc.) was that it was able to make great compositions, but only ones that, for the most part, were not fresh or new and generally stuck to the styles that said-above artists used most often.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The way how to work with this  material is again upon him, and hardly can be directly derived from  the scale or tuning itself. There are exceptions.&quot;<br/>Right...but (as I understand it) the material is not derived from but rather expressed through the tunings.  In the &quot;odd&quot; (I&apos;m being sarcastic, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s that odd at all) case that the mood a composer wants to hit isn&apos;t able to be expressed anywhere more than &quot;half-fully&quot; in 12TET having other scales available seems to be an obvious advantage.  In a way, I figure having only 12TET and slight variants of it available is like having Tiger Woods head out on the golf course with only one type of club (that is really only made for a few types of shots) for the entire game.</p></div><h3><a id=88755 href="#88755">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 4:46:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I think to a degree all of us here agree with him on one point: a<br/>composer&apos;s interaction with a scale/tuning has a definite effect on the<br/>compositions said composer can produce--much like the way a poet&apos;s<br/>native language will affect the poems said poet can produce.&quot;<br/>   Right...it provides a quick path to expressiveness and often allows more ways for expression (IE a poet in his native tongue has more word choices and can, say, choose the &quot;synonym&quot; that suits what he/she wants to express exactly rather than use a word that by and large just estimates it).</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think the best music I&apos;ve heard is great because of the interplay of<br/>consonance and dissonance, and that just as &quot;good&quot; is often said to<br/>need &quot;evil&quot; in order to exist, consonance needs dissonance in order to<br/>be effective musically.&quot;<br/>   Right...but then the question becomes how consonant or dissonant do you need to get to capture this contrast.  And my point there becomes...it&apos;s generally better, far as listeners are concerned, to have the interplay between these two be between mildly dissonant and very consonant. (as, admittedly, 12TET does this to an extent) than between mildly dissonant and very dissonant.  One need not get knee deep in dissonance in order to promote this consonance/dissonance contrast.</p><p>&gt;&quot;For me, the &quot;perfect scale&quot; would absolutely NOT be one devoid of<br/>dissonance, but one wherein the dissonances are placed exactly where I<br/>want them (wherever that might be), and wherein the consonances take a<br/>little bit more work to really bring out.&quot;<br/>   Well...no scale is ever going to be devoid of dissonance, just as no scale is ever going to be completely devoid of consonance.  I&apos;m still trying to figure out why you appear to think high dissonance is the best way to get contrast for musicians on the average (if that&apos;s what you&apos;re implying).  Sure, there will always be composers &quot;on the edge&quot; who revel in balancing high dissonances and a few consonances in such a clever way it still manages to feel balanced...but I doubt it is a path that will be taken seriously by a majority of non-academic composers.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It would be a scale that FORCES me to think, not one that quantizes<br/>even the most banal compositions into a pristine and polished jewel.&quot;<br/>  Fair enough...my ideals are based on the assumption that the average composer wants more &quot;jewels&quot; and more variety in harmony available for less work.  But that&apos;s just a basic product concept...one virtually all businesses use: more for less and/or ease of use.  I doubt many people want their scales to feel like Rubix Cubes.  If I purposefully made computer programs for my job to be as hard to use as Rubix Cubes are to solve and then said something like &quot;well, I did it partly to help weed out incompetent users/&apos;composers&apos; &quot;...I wouldn&apos;t have a job...</p><p>&gt;&quot;For of course such a dissonance-free scale would be an unavoidable<br/>equalizer among composers. There has to be some measure of challenge to<br/>music, or else what is to distinguish the masters from the amateurs?<br/>When any note can be combined just as well with any other, how is one<br/>to choose notes effectively?&quot;<br/>   They don&apos;t fit equally well...anyhow such a structure is not mathematically possible even if one wanted it.<br/>&gt;&quot;There has to be some measure of challenge to<br/>music, or else what is to distinguish the masters from the amateurs?&quot;<br/>  Well let&apos;s see....the actual mood/emotion in the song, the phrasing of the song, the instrumental arrangements used, effects used, timbre of the vocals, timing and choice of drums, tempo.  The difference I see in having a scale that keeps dissonance from becoming annoyingly high (to most people) regardless of chords chosen is it forces musicians to compete on the level of actual feeling/soul/imagination in their piece rather than how well they know the scale (as it becomes very easy to know a scale).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Though of course whether Michael has actually produced the scale he is<br/>seeking is another matter entirely, but I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not too<br/>interested in that (given my staunch disagreement with the<br/>philosophical underpinnings of his quest).&quot;<br/>   Hmm...well let me get this right.  I greatly support what you are doing...proven that &quot;wheat&quot; can be extracted from the &quot;chaff&quot; of even the &quot;worst&quot; scales and fooling people &quot;myself included&quot; into thinking any scale can be easy to use judging from the quality of much of your music.  And I also support your making music the way you make it and think a lot of people WILL want to listen.</p><p>  But the other side of me is thinking in terms of realistic marketing and the quest to get the average musician interested in micro-tonal music...and, feel free to argue against this, but I doubt the &quot;lure of solving the scale/tonality equivalent of a Rubix Cube&quot; for as finding and balancing the good points of generally dissonant scales is going to make many people want to hop on board.  At best a figure a musician will hear a piece you make, think it&apos;s pretty cool, try the scale you use themselves, become frustrated rather quickly, and give up (minus a few people with very good &quot;ears&quot; for playing by ear).  So while I think your idealisms are definitely interesting, I don&apos;t see how they&apos;d make major impact in the musical world far as an alternative composition standard in the near future.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=88760 href="#88760">ðŸ”—</a>Cox Franklin &#x3C;franklincox@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 10:37:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael,</p><p>you keep imposing your private templates on other composers and musicians, and it is getting irritating.&nbsp; Your criterion of &quot;making a living off one&apos;s music&quot; seems to be the primary test of how much &quot;people&quot; (which people?) like the music, which seems to be the primary measure of the music&apos;s value. Probably no major European composer before the Baroque period made a living off his music; they were usually working for the church or for a patron (or in Gesualdo&apos;s case, a nobleman). There was more of a free market in the Baroque period, but most&nbsp; composers still worked for church institutions or were patronized by the nobility. Bach didn&apos;t make a living off his music; he was hired to supervise sacred music and teach Latin, and the church authorities were irritated he wrote as much as he did.&nbsp; He wouldn&apos;t have survived as a free-lancer, *and* people in Leipzig didn&apos;t seem to especially like his music.&nbsp; Beethoven wouldn&apos;t have made a living off his music<br/> if his primary patron hadn&apos;t been the brother of the emperor. Schubert didn&apos;t make a living off his music; he had a strong following among his friends, but he didn&apos;t make money from his compositions. Schumann didn&apos;t really make a living off his music&nbsp; In contrast, nor did Wagner until toward the end of his life, nor did Bruckner, nor did Mahler, and so on. On the other hand Clementi made a lot of money off his music, each piece worked out by assistants according to formula he provided, each new work as banal as the previous one (this is surely an early case of algorithmic composition!).&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, very few of what most of us view as the most significant European composers made a living off their music, whereas in general a few of the less interesting ones did.&nbsp; There is not much historical support for your thesis, at least if you have any interest in originality and high quality.</p><p>As for other kinds of music than melodies supported by chords, you ask, &quot;[H]ow common is it for people worldwide to like said kind of music?&quot;&nbsp; My answer is &quot;Very common for almost all cultures for almost the entire history of mankind.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps you should take a serious course in Music Anthropology so that you might understand how broad the range of humankind&apos;s musical creativity is and has been.&nbsp; Pop-influenced groups are not the measure of all things.</p><p>David Cope&apos;s algorithmic compositions (which is the ones I believe you are talking about) are not &quot;great&quot; compositions, they are generic compositions; the genre is &quot;Bach style&quot; or &quot;Mozart style.&quot; I find almost no personality in them; it&apos;s a bit like seeing a hologram of a real person.&nbsp;</p><p>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Thu, 5/6/10, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Sleep (SATB) example of using minor 2nds<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Thursday, May 6, 2010, 10:35 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      Daniel&gt;&quot;But music is not only melody accompanied by chords, there&apos;s much more...

Although I will again add that bringing the style a classical composer had and making a fresh new style are two completely different things.  Hence my stress on the alternative of having a scale which &quot;solves it&apos;s own music theory so the musician playing it will have more energy left to focus on emotion without worrying about complying with music theory&quot;.</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=88765 href="#88765">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 11:56:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;If you are talking about the work of Copes you are overselling it.&quot;<br/>Yes I was talking about David Cope...only the name escaped me when I wrote the original message.<br/>But how do you feel I&apos;m &quot;overselling it&quot; so far as his AI-produced music?</p></div><h3><a id=88768 href="#88768">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 12:39:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;David Cope&apos;s algorithmic compositions (which is the ones I believe you<br/>&gt; are talking about) are not &quot;great&quot; compositions, they are generic<br/>&gt; compositions; the genre is &quot;Bach style&quot; or &quot;Mozart style.&quot; I find almost no personality in them; it&apos;s a bit like seeing a hologram of a real<br/>&gt; person. &quot;<br/>&gt;    Who knows...I might think that same thing after hearing his &quot;artificial-intelligence-composed&quot; music....by any chance do you know where I can find mp3&apos;s or MIDIs of his (AKA his computer&apos;s) work?</p><p><a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/mp3page.htm">http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/mp3page.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=88769 href="#88769">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 12:51:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;If you are talking about the work of Copes you are overselling it.&quot;<br/>&gt; Yes I was talking about David Cope...only the name escaped me when I wrote the original message.<br/>&gt; But how do you feel I&apos;m &quot;overselling it&quot; so far as his AI-produced music?</p><p>It&apos;s not great music even after he&apos;s finished cherry-picking for the best examples.

My original point was admittedly that &quot;few minor seconds and used in chords&quot;...thus indicating what I believed to be a problem with 12TET&apos;s ability to accommodate for many chords using minor seconds.  You in part disproved this by giving tons of examples of chords, but a huge majority of which had B C E type of interval structure (such as the common inverted major 7th chord). So the counter-examples you gave were almost all completely based on only one permutation (and, to some extent, were really just variations on that single interval structure).  Which again...I&apos;m arguing...is proof that 12TET can only use semi-tones in chords in fairly limited ways.</p><p>So when I said<br/>      &quot;Show me a piece written in 12TET which uses consecutive minor 2nds such as C C# D or D D# E which doesn&apos;t sound terribly tense and I&apos;ll believe 12TET encompasses the limits of narrow-spaced- interval harmony. :-D &quot;</p><p>   ....I did so as I wanted to give a much more obvious challenge than spending a whole lot of time trying to make a challenge with, for example, making chords containing the interval structure in chords like B C F or B C D consonant.   Bottom line again: to make consonant chords in 12TET you are limited in the types of intervals you can place around that minor second without causing dissonance.  And the most obvious example of an interval that would not sound consonant next to a minor second is (of course) another minor-second.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So... you use intervals &gt; minor 2nds and would dare me to not sound more dissonant with actually using minor 2nds?  This is a fool&apos;s errand.&quot;<br/>   Indeed, because obviously a minor second is an incredibly dissonant interval and the closer to 1.05 the worse according to the theory of critical band dissonance.  What I&apos;m again saying here is...12TET does a lousy job at following that theory and obviously almost anything further away from the 12TET semitone of 1.05 will sound not just less dissonant but significantly so.  I you really realize the minor 2nd has consonance problems, why are you going out on a limb to promote how supposedly flexible it is in consonant chords?</p><p>&gt;&quot;And.... out of tune is something different than clusters. I&apos;ve used clusters. A lot. I&apos;ve never heard &quot;out of tune&quot;. Ever.&quot;<br/>    Well what diatonic scale used in modern popular music contains all of the following notes: C C# D?   At least one tone has to be out of key...and therefore obviously also &quot;out of tune&quot;.  And since when are tonal clusters held in sustain as chords in popular music...I&apos;d be interested to hear proof of that as well.</p></div><h3><a id=88774 href="#88774">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 1:40:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not great music even after he&apos;s finished cherry-picking for the best examples.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard more recent works with his newer AI engine, and some of it sounds very natural and somewhat substantial.

When I speak about music in terms of<br/>composers and compositions, I am speaking about the art of music, not music as<br/>a commercial enterprise.&quot;<br/>  Actually, so ultimately do I.  The problems I see are that<br/>A) You obviously need composers to make music.  The more people competing as composers and attracted to composing music...the better chance more of them in total will create great music.<br/>B) Far as micro-tonal music...we lack that sort of competition.   There are tons of could-be-great-microtonal musicians running around composing 12TET and ignoring micro-tonal music.   To bring the composers to micro-tonal music...we must first convince them the switch to micro-tonal is worth it...and showing them a song with modern techniques and values yet micro-tonal under-lyings is IMVHO a great way to attract them into micro-tonal composition.  In other words, only a limited number of musicians in academia are likely to take note of, say, someone translating Bach into micro-tonal...but if someone were to write more popular-style music the chance of modern musicians taking it seriously as valid to their every-day compositional style is likely higher.</p><p>&gt;&quot;When you use the word &quot;composer,&quot; you<br/>are using a term that bears some honor thanks to the outstanding composers of<br/>the past whose works  came to be viewed as core expressions of our<br/>culture (most of whom never wrote a piece that was a &quot;hit&quot; in their<br/>own day).&quot;<br/>    It seems you can&apos;t get past the idea that I&apos;m trying to introduce people to micro-tonality on their level rather than force them to directly refer to the greats of the past...and yet that I also greatly respect past composers.  I also greatly respect the inventors of the first computers and early video gaming and realize the rest of what happend was directly influenced by them.  But I also realize almost no one would take me seriously if I used a Commodore 64 from 1980 as an example of &quot;why you should love computers&quot;....many people would likely get so impatient and annoyed with me for &quot;bragging about inferior technology&quot; they wouldn&apos;t want to stick around to learn the history.</p><p>    On the other hand, if a composer&apos;s attention to micro-tonality is grabbed by a pop-piece and then expands into its deeper roots like Bohlen-Pierce, mean-tone, and other constructs...more power to them!  But I don&apos;t believe in suddenly forcing education or doctrines on people but rather, reeling them in with marketable material first and then letting the more advanced of them discover the roots. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;You speak about how new tuning systems<br/>might allow composers to write great pieces, etc. but it seems as though what<br/>you are really talking about is songwriters writing hits.&quot;<br/>    I am actually speaking about both a system that, on one hand, makes composing easier for the average musician and, on another hand, has the flexibility needed to create the sort of more complex great songs that we regard in history as &quot;classics&quot;.

According to your theory, we should have at least several times as much great music now than a hundred years ago. &nbsp;This has not proven to be the case; it is unlikely that your theory is correct.<br/>You write, &quot;In other words, only a limited number of musicians in academia are likely to take note of, say, someone translating Bach into micro-tonal. ..but if someone were to write more popular-style music the chance of modern musicians taking it seriously as valid to their every-day compositional style is likely higher.&quot; &nbsp;I&apos;ve seen this pop up elsewhere in your posts: you distinguish &quot;musicians in academia&quot; from &quot;modern musicians.&quot; &nbsp;Musicians in academia are modern musicians, aren&apos;t they? &nbsp;Or are you claiming that some people who are living now are more modern than others? On what basis? &nbsp;If I may be so bold, it seems &nbsp; that your criteria for being a &quot;modern musician,&quot; include 1)&nbsp;being an average musician and&nbsp;&nbsp;2) not knowing or caring very much about the theory or history of music. Thus, it appears that superb musicians and those who care deeply about the theory and history of music are&nbsp;old-fashioned musicians. &nbsp; So if, for example, &nbsp;someone<br/> spends years learning to play and perceive complicated rhythms and microtonal systems, he or she is no longer a modern musician. An interesting theory.<br/>If you want to compose music that attracts a large following, then more power to you. &nbsp;In a sense, it really doesn&apos;t matter what&nbsp;your theories about what people will love really matter at all, because in your value system the acid test is sales. What you need to do now is write the music that millions of people will love...don&apos;t talk about it, do it.

Of course there was a past...but only for a select few does the past generate quick and direct interest in composing music.&nbsp;<br/>I am trying to figure out a way to advertise micro-tonal music to the current public and get them to take it seriously.&nbsp; An obvious way to do that seems to be to look at what has advertised well to the public in recent history.&nbsp; Doing otherwise would be like using trends in computing in the 1960&apos;s to design systems for today&apos;s market demands.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I am not involved in popular music, and I don&apos;t<br/>really care what the latest hit is. &nbsp; When I speak about music in terms of<br/>composers and compositions, I am speaking about the art of music, not music as<br/>a commercial enterprise.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Actually, so ultimately do I.&nbsp; The problems I see are that<br/>A) You obviously need composers to make music.&nbsp; The more people competing as composers and attracted to composing music...the better chance more of them in total will create great music.<br/>B) Far as micro-tonal music...we lack that sort of competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are tons of could-be-great- microtonal musicians running around composing 12TET and ignoring micro-tonal music.&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring the composers to micro-tonal music...we must first convince them the switch to micro-tonal is worth it...and showing them a song with modern techniques and values yet micro-tonal under-lyings is IMVHO a great way to attract them into micro-tonal composition.&nbsp; In other words, only a limited number of musicians in academia are likely to take note of, say, someone translating Bach into micro-tonal. ..but if someone were to write more popular-style<br/> music the chance of modern musicians taking it seriously as valid to their every-day compositional style is likely higher.</p><p>&gt;&quot;When you use the word &quot;composer,&quot; you<br/>are using a term that bears some honor thanks to the outstanding composers of<br/>the past whose works&nbsp; came to be viewed as core expressions of our<br/>culture (most of whom never wrote a piece that was a &quot;hit&quot; in their<br/>own day).&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems you can&apos;t get past the idea that I&apos;m trying to introduce people to micro-tonality on their level rather than force them to directly refer to the greats of the past...and yet that I also greatly respect past composers.&nbsp; I also greatly respect the inventors of the first computers and early video gaming and realize the rest of what happend was directly influenced by them.&nbsp; But I also realize almost no one would take me seriously if I used a Commodore 64 from 1980 as an example of &quot;why you should love computers&quot;.. ..many people would likely get so impatient and annoyed with me for &quot;bragging about inferior technology&quot; they wouldn&apos;t want to stick around to learn the history. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if a composer&apos;s attention to micro-tonality is grabbed by a pop-piece and then expands into its deeper roots like Bohlen-Pierce, mean-tone, and other constructs.. .more power to<br/> them!&nbsp; But I don&apos;t believe in suddenly forcing education or doctrines on people but rather, reeling them in with marketable material first and then letting the more advanced of them discover the roots. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;You speak about how new tuning systems<br/>might allow composers to write great pieces, etc. but it seems as though what<br/>you are really talking about is songwriters writing hits.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I guarantee you I have the most &quot;average&quot; ability of any musician likely to take the plunge into microtonality.  My work is not an example of how some expert composer can bend even the most difficult scale to his or her whim, it&apos;s an example of how an average musician with access to common mainstream equipment can easily get good results from theoretically-terrible scales.  If there&apos;s any message my music should be sending, it&apos;s not &quot;it CAN be done if you work hard enough&quot;, but rather &quot;it&apos;s EASY TO DO if you just try it&quot;.</p><p>If your goal for the &quot;Infinity Scale&quot; is to use it to &quot;market&quot; microtonality to the public, you&apos;re wasting your time.  The &quot;barrier&quot; to keeping microtonality out of the hands and minds of the public is NOT a lack of the right scale--there are hundreds, maybe even THOUSANDS, of scales that can more or less satisfy your criteria, many of which have already been explored (or at least proposed).  The fact that even *I*, with my dim knowledge of microtonal history, am aware of this, means that you really haven&apos;t done your homework.  One more great scale is a drop in an ocean of great scales, truly.</p><p>No, the barrier is the average person&apos;s attachment to institutions and conventions.  Most musicians don&apos;t CARE how cool microtonality can get, or how much easier it can make music.  Why?  There are many reasons: because it&apos;s unfamiliar; because microtonality requires investments in (usually expensive) retuned (or retunable) instruments; because microtonal instruments and scales are typically not &quot;backwards-compatible&quot; with what they already know about music; and because converting to microtonality might reduce their ability to jam with other musicians.  You&apos;ve got to face the fact that 12-tET is STIFF competition, because it&apos;s already pretty easy to play and learn, and it&apos;s really pretty nice-sounding...and there is a vast &quot;support network&quot; for it!  Even if it&apos;s a little difficult to self-teach 12-tET music skills, there is a vast array of books, classes, and teachers out there to help any student along.  It is ubiquitous in our culture, and that is what makes it so attractive.  Even the most amazing perfect scale will lack this support group.</p><p>What would be required to see your scale find its way into the pop mainstream?  Armies of singers will have to be retrained, warehouses of guitars refretted, keyboards re-designed (or at least reprogrammed), brass and woodwinds re-configured or the players taught complex new fingerings...only the drummers will be spared!  With so much great music already existing in 12-tET, how can you EVER expect your one perfect scale to justify such a vast commercial undertaking?</p><p>Then consider how difficult it has been for you to even get the support of your fellow microtonalists.  If you can&apos;t win US over, how can you expect to win over THE GENERAL PUBLIC?  You&apos;d need to have the support of a movement behind you, but whatever microtonal movement there might be is decidedly too PANTHEISTIC to support your approach.  All the microtonalists that I see actively advancing microtonal music into the public sphere (Jacob Barton, Andrew Heathwaite, Aaron Krister Johnson, XJ Scott, Ron Sword, Elaine Walker, Paul Rubenstein, just to name a few) are polymicrotonalists, true believers that a diversity of tunings is the key, not just a &quot;one true tuning&quot;.  What most of us want is to teach people that tuning is a choice and that alternatives exist, not just to give them *one* alternative and expect them to be satisfied.  We&apos;d all happily embrace your scale and your approach if it wasn&apos;t so...monotheistic.  So really, mate, you&apos;re fighting both the conformists AND the non-conformists here if you insist that your scale will be ANYONE&apos;S ideal scale but your own.</p><p>End rant.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=88807 href="#88807">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 9:22:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dr. Cox&gt;&quot;Again you speak about what &quot;people love,&quot; but I have no idea which people you are talking about, and I&apos;m not sure that I care.&quot;<br/>   Look at what people download far as music.  What do they have on their I-Pods.  Which musicians will they actually pay to hear live.  The types of people on the average who engaged in such activities in order to hear musicians are the kinds of people I am aiming at pitching micro-tonality to.  And to note, on the average I&apos;m pretty sure out of all such people only a tiny fraction are, for example, teachers and/or masters of traditional music theory or history.<br/>   Saying something like &quot;any decent way to improve music must make it past academia and be proven in a huge book proving it&apos;s relation to all predecessors before it is pitched to the public&quot; would likely be not only elitist, but ultimately not helpful or even harmful toward getting average listeners and composers interested in micro-tonal music.  What it would likely do is get the remaining, say, 0.01% of the population who are masters in academia involved...and would almost have to assume those very few people could produce more quality music than hundreds of thousands of bands in the &quot;general public&quot;.  Again I have a tough time believing the &quot;historical approach&quot; is going to result in better music considering just how many could-be-great musicians and listeners it &quot;singles out&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve<br/>seen this pop up elsewhere in your posts: you distinguish &quot;musicians in<br/>academia&quot; from &quot;modern musicians.&quot;  Musicians in academia are modern<br/>musicians, aren&apos;t they?&quot;<br/>   Not in the way I&apos;m focusing on.  How many musicians do you know deep into observing historical musical tradition have taken the same styles and made music popular enough to become a house-hold name with such styles IE be &quot;modernly popular&quot;?<br/>   It&apos;s true there are cases of, say, BT (Brain Transeau) being a heavily historically-trained musician and turning into a house-hold name...but even in such cases he reserved his traditional styles for things like movie soundtracks and held back or at least &quot;tamed&quot; them when he made &quot;pop&quot; music.  Same goes for Metallica and their classical music training roots   So an academic musician can of course be a modern musician in the pop sense...but many if not most academic musicians are not &quot;modern popular&quot;...otherwise they, like BT, would likely be able to do things like make a living purely off gigs and selling albums...without teaching.  Again, not relating to making money = being a good musician...but their having enough fans to &quot;get away&quot; with that.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If<br/>you want to compose music that attracts a large following, then more<br/>power to you.  In a sense, it really doesn&apos;t matter what your theories<br/>about what people will love really matter at all, because in your value<br/>system the acid test is sales.&quot;<br/>    No it&apos;s not...the &quot;acid/PH test&quot; is how many fans like the music enough to make sacrifices to hear it...and I just figured money is the most obvious sacrifice.  Someone begging their piano teacher to learn how to play your song is yet another such sacrifice...as is a fan&apos;s learning micro-tonal or buying musical equipment similar to yours to &quot;sound more like you&quot;.  It&apos;s not really about money, but about loyalty.  If people are loyal to a musician...they will likely be more willing to follow that musician into theories, like micro-tonality, that they wouldn&apos;t normally consider.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I<br/>would just request that you not try to impose your value system on<br/>others who don&apos;t share it.&quot;<br/>   Well ok...my goal is to find out ways to make micro-tonal music attractive to the public in such a way more composers want to learn to compose using micro-tonal scales and such.  If I were &gt;forcing&lt; the idea onto others, I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d also have to say &quot;all other theories toward accomplishing this goal of publicizing are wrong&quot;...which is something I have not done.<br/>   I&apos;m NOT saying my way is the only way to do this...but rather that it can be A right way.  Perhaps there are more and, if there are, I&apos;d love to hear other ideas how to accomplish the goal of spreading micro-tonal music and getting more people interested in composing it.</p><p>    So far, sadly, I&apos;ve hear a lot of whining about faults in my methods and virtually no alternatives to how to make micro-tonal music popular, minus a couple of ideas from Sean and Marcel.  I just want to lean the discussion toward bringing up good ideas, rather than shooting down virtually every idea in sight (no wonder with such a low &quot;Puritan&quot; attitude micro-tonal music hasn&apos;t made it into the public eye much at all).</p></div><h3><a id=88808 href="#88808">ðŸ”—</a>Cox Franklin &#x3C;franklincox@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 9:28:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael,&nbsp;<br/>When you write something like, &quot;it might take, say, 20 different pop songs to cover all the techniques or chords in one classical song,&quot; you are making a statement that appears to have some empirical content.

People would cease to value music as much; you&apos;d have lots more people dropping in for a lesson or two, but far fewer people studying seriously for 10 or 15 years. &nbsp;In my experience, (all things being equal)&nbsp;when you set high standards that are also fair, &nbsp; you will in fact attract more people and more people who are likely to succeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>This has nothing to do with the issue of elitism, which is usually thrown out in a gesture of fake populism. &nbsp;If a group of people is born rich and powerful and nobody from outside the group has any chance of entering, &nbsp;then you&apos;ve got a poisonous elitism. &nbsp;But if a discipline achieves high standards, allows new people into the discipline but requires every member to meet those standards, that is not elitism in the same sense at all. &nbsp;Do you scream &quot;elitism&quot; when doctors are required to pass rigorous examinations allowing them to practice medicine? &nbsp;</p><p>--- On Fri, 5/7/10, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Sleep (SATB) example of using minor 2nds--Typos fixed<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Friday, May 7, 2010, 3:52 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      Me&gt;&quot;But in general so far as I&apos;ve seen the scales and even chords<br/>used in pop are not far behind...just used in a less complex manner IE<br/>it might take, say, 20 different pop songs to cover all the techniques<br/>or chords in one classical song.&quot;<br/>Chris&gt;&quot;With all due respect Michael how can you make this statement if you haven&apos;t seriously studied classical music, let alone modern classical music?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m not saying anything as a historical fact...but rather what I hear...and although I haven&apos;t studied classical music formally I certainly have listened to a good deal of it.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is this about to become an &quot;elite argument&quot; about who has the most advanced techniques regardless of what percentage of it people actually can digest or hear as unique?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, I swear, that&apos;s one of the sad reasons so many people are turned away from the arts of classical and jazz music...the elitist attitude of &quot;you are too dumb/un-studied to hear the &apos;factual&apos; brilliance of this type of music...it can&apos;t possibly have anything to do with the composers&apos; inability to connect with you emotionally&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=88809 href="#88809">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 9:34:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dr Cox,</p><p>    Yes I&apos;ve heard of Duke Ellington, but yes I doubt mentioning his name or playing his music to my friends would suddenly send them in a frenzy to learn things like Debussy&apos;s composition style.

If you want to &quot;improve&quot; that, fine..do it. But first you have to succeed in the business, sell a millions of copies of your pieces, and become a force in the business.

but I have no idea which people you are talking about, and I&apos;m not sure that I care.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at what people download far as music.&nbsp; What do they have on their I-Pods.&nbsp; Which musicians will they actually pay to hear live.&nbsp; The types of people on the average who engaged in such activities in order to hear musicians are the kinds of people I am aiming at pitching micro-tonality to.&nbsp; And to note, on the average I&apos;m pretty sure out of all such people only a tiny fraction are, for example, teachers and/or masters of traditional music theory or history.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying<br/> something like &quot;any decent way to improve music must make it past academia and be proven in a huge book proving it&apos;s relation to all predecessors before it is pitched to the public&quot; would likely be not only elitist, but ultimately not helpful or even harmful toward getting average listeners and composers interested in micro-tonal music.&nbsp; What it would likely do is get the remaining, say, 0.01% of the population who are masters in academia involved...and would almost have to assume those very few people could produce more quality music than hundreds of thousands of bands in the &quot;general public&quot;.&nbsp; Again I have a tough time believing the &quot;historical approach&quot; is going to result in better music considering just how many could-be-great musicians and listeners it &quot;singles out&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve<br/>seen this pop up elsewhere in your posts: you distinguish &quot;musicians in<br/>academia&quot; from &quot;modern musicians.&quot; &nbsp;Musicians in academia are modern<br/>musicians, aren&apos;t they?&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not in the way I&apos;m focusing on.&nbsp; How many musicians do you know deep into observing historical musical tradition have taken the same styles and made music popular enough to become a house-hold name with such styles IE be &quot;modernly popular&quot;?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; It&apos;s true there are cases of, say, BT (Brain Transeau) being a heavily historically- trained musician and turning into a house-hold name...but even in such cases he reserved his traditional styles for things like movie soundtracks and held back or at least &quot;tamed&quot; them when he made &quot;pop&quot; music.&nbsp; Same goes for Metallica and their classical music training roots&nbsp;&nbsp; So an academic musician can of course be a modern musician in the pop sense...but many if not most academic musicians are not &quot;modern<br/> popular&quot;...otherwis e they, like BT, would likely be able to do things like make a living purely off gigs and selling albums...without teaching.&nbsp; Again, not relating to making money = being a good musician...but their having enough fans to &quot;get away&quot; with that.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If<br/>you want to compose music that attracts a large following, then more<br/>power to you. &nbsp;In a sense, it really doesn&apos;t matter what&nbsp;your theories<br/>about what people will love really matter at all, because in your value<br/>system the acid test is sales.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No it&apos;s not...the &quot;acid/PH test&quot; is how many fans like the music enough to make sacrifices to hear it...and I just figured money is the most obvious sacrifice.&nbsp; Someone begging their piano teacher to learn how to play your song is yet another such sacrifice... as is a fan&apos;s learning micro-tonal or buying musical equipment similar to yours to &quot;sound more like you&quot;.&nbsp; It&apos;s not really about money, but about loyalty.&nbsp; If people are loyal to a musician...they will likely be more willing to follow that musician into theories, like micro-tonality, that they wouldn&apos;t normally consider.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I<br/>would just request that you not try to impose your value system on<br/>others who don&apos;t share it.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well ok...my goal is to find out ways to make micro-tonal music attractive to the public in such a way more composers want to learn to compose using micro-tonal scales and such.&nbsp; If I were &gt;forcing&lt; the idea onto others, I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d also have to say &quot;all other theories toward accomplishing this goal of publicizing are wrong&quot;...which is something I have not done.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m NOT saying my way is the only way to do this...but rather that it can be A right way.&nbsp; Perhaps there are more and, if there are, I&apos;d love to hear other ideas how to accomplish the goal of spreading micro-tonal music and getting more people interested in composing it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, sadly, I&apos;ve hear a lot of whining about faults in my methods and virtually no alternatives to how to make micro-tonal music popular, minus a couple of ideas from Sean and Marcel.&nbsp; I just want to lean the<br/> discussion toward bringing up good ideas, rather than shooting down virtually every idea in sight (no wonder with such a low &quot;Puritan&quot; attitude micro-tonal music hasn&apos;t made it into the public eye much at all).</p></div><h3><a id=88815 href="#88815">ðŸ”—</a>Cox Franklin &#x3C;franklincox@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 9:47:25 PM</span><button style="float: right;

There are many reasons: because it&apos;s unfamiliar; because<br/>microtonality requires investments in (usually expensive) retuned (or<br/>retunable) instruments; because microtonal instruments and scales are<br/>typically not &quot;backwards-compatib le&quot; with what they already know about<br/>music; and because converting to microtonality might reduce their<br/>ability to jam with other musicians.&quot;<br/>   These are all good points...having to do with issues like compatibility between musicians and lack of easy to obtain, cheap, mass-produced micro-tonal-capable instruments.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You&apos;ve got to face the fact that<br/>12-tET is STIFF competition, because it&apos;s already pretty easy to play<br/>and learn, and it&apos;s really pretty nice-sounding&quot;<br/>   I have my doubts about this though.  There are so many people looking for pretty-sounding chords and such but are doing bizarre things (crazy timbres, Tom-Morello style harmonic effects on guitars, odd de-tuning of strings on purpose...) all in an apparent to jazz up chord progressions where many musicians admit it&apos;s very hard to do something that hasn&apos;t already been done.  It seems obvious to me there is a huge thirst among musicians for new scales that offer ways to jazz up playing styles.</p><p>&gt;&quot;All the microtonalists that I see actively advancing microtonal music<br/>into the public sphere (Jacob Barton, Andrew Heathwaite, Aaron Krister<br/>Johnson, XJ Scott, Ron Sword, Elaine Walker, Paul Rubenstein, just to<br/>name a few) are polymicrotonalists, true believers that a diversity of<br/>tunings is the key, not just a &quot;one true tuning&quot;.&quot;<br/>   Who ever said I believed in &quot;one true tuning?&quot;  Consistently I&apos;ve pledged support for 22TET, Erv Wilson&apos;s Hexanies scales, Sethares 10 and 11TET with spectral remapping, the Ptolemy Homalon scales, and recently 17TET...I&apos;m certainly not for the idea of one scale being ideal for everything.  You also have to remember I have made a Silver Ratio section, PHI ratio section, x/18 harmonic series based division scale, and several other scales in the past...each concentrating on different goals.</p><p>    I do believe, though...that there are scales that are more ideal for most of the sorts of things people turn to 12TET for in the first place.  I&apos;m trying to create ONE of such scales...and certainly not with the idea it&apos;s the only one possible.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What most of us want is to teach people that tuning is a choice and<br/>that alternatives exist, not just to give them *one* alternative and<br/>expect them to be satisfied.&quot;<br/>   However, you have to get someone interested in one thing to get them to look at a second, third, fourth....so having another &quot;very good option&quot; to use as such a first thing to display to &quot;first time viewers&quot; obviously should help.</p></div><h3><a id=88822 href="#88822">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 10:13:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dr. Cox&gt;&quot;The only whining I see in this discussion is coming from you.

It is not the definition one usually associates with microtonal music. &nbsp;It is not the definition one finds in dictionaries. &nbsp;<br/>I consider myself a modern listener--i.e., I try to keep up on the latest developments in my field, I regularly perform works of modern composers, I compose modern music. &nbsp;Yet you insist that &quot;modern&quot; means what you say it means. &nbsp;Does anyone agree with you on this?&nbsp;&nbsp;You&apos;ve ignored the point I made earlier--you keep trying to bracket off your definition of &quot;modern popular&quot; as beginning in 1980, but then you use terms like &quot;composer&quot; and &quot;classics&quot; and &quot;great pieces&quot;, whose origin and meaning won&apos;t fit within your little box. &nbsp;And the discussion did stray--I believe you brought this up--into David Cope and composing algorithms; many of his examples are imitations of classical pieces. &nbsp;<br/>And why 1980? &nbsp;Did anyone agree with this delimitation? Or didn&apos;t you simply decree it?&nbsp;<br/>It&apos;s the same dynamic as what happened with your statements about minor 2nds and popular music. On face value they were wrong, but when other participants provided counter-evidence, you began complaining that you meant different types of music, changed the definition of popular music, changed you criteria concerning dissonance, and so on and so forth. &nbsp;You finally came up with a definition--a chord containing two consecutive half steps--that indeed is not considered a chord in either common practice music (uh-oh, this is &quot;the past,&quot; so we&apos;re forbidden to mention it; you&apos;re allowed to mention it though, because different rules apply for you) or modern popular music. &nbsp;But here&apos;s the problem--nobody ever claimed that such a chord was considered a typical chord (this does occur as a sonority in plenty of common practice music, but is not categorized as a chord), so your definition doesn&apos;t really contribute much to the discussion, and is irrelevant to your<br/> original point. &nbsp;One could just as well say, &quot;interval combinations including all twelve tones are not considered chords in common practice music.&quot; True, but who ever made the claim that they were?<br/>I&apos;m sorry if you resent the historical perspective I&apos;ve provided. &nbsp;I didn&apos;t mean to give you a &quot;history lesson.&quot; &nbsp;I can see that whenever you make a statement about music, you want everyone to agree to it, whether it is correct or not.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Fri, 5/7/10, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Sleep (SATB) example of using minor 2nds--Typos fixed<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Friday, May 7, 2010, 5:13 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      Dr. Cox&gt;&quot;The only whining I see in this discussion is coming from you.

I don&apos;t recall hearing either of these as commonly used in pop music as held-sustained chords and strongly suspect the dissonance is why they don&apos;t &quot;want to risk inflicting such chords upon the public&quot;.</p><p>   Of course you can have chords like B C E G or G B C E IE inverted 7th chords...but beside those chords and chords which add notes beyond the top-bottom edges of those your choices of chords possible with half steps are pretty limited in 12TET.<br/>  The idea is...compare this to the numbers of chords with inverted 7th-like consonance you can get in scales like Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales with it&apos;s 9/8 10/9 11/10 12/10 10/9 11/10 12/11 interval structure (chords such as and/or nearing 9:10:11 and 9:10:12 and 18:20:24:30 and 20:24:33:36)....and you&apos;ll see 12TET is missing a lot of possible clustered chords due to it&apos;s inherent need to space notes away from the half-step to achieve a fair level of consonance and &quot;make up&quot; for the fact the 18/17-ish interval represented by a 12TET half step is so much more dissonant than intervals such as the 11/10 and 12/11 half steps in scales like 7TET and Ptolemic scales.</p><p>   Long story short...I believe this ties into a possible avenue to expand micro-tonallity into popular music as<br/>A) It adds the possibility of new chords and very original chord progressions, something composers often have trouble searching for<br/>B) It does so, in micro-tonal scales, without giving up the kind of balance, consonance, and confidence composers have learned to expect from their experience with 12TET.</p></div><h3><a id=88835 href="#88835">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2010 11:02:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; MikeB&gt;&quot;Then I have no idea what you&apos;re saying.

But I&apos;ve found nothing as good as the originals, which is to be expected. None of the composers you mention was particularly innovative, although all achieved a distinctive style (especially Sibelius, whose music I respect tremendously). &nbsp;All of these composers developed an individual style out of materials that were more or less already prepared by other composers. Someone continuing in this vein would be probably using already well-worn materials, and it would be very hard to squeeze anything distinctive out of them. &nbsp;In addition, most of this syntax passed into composition for movies, where it serves a different function than music in the concert hall.<br/>You could also check out hundreds of pieces by Soviet-era composers. &nbsp;They were straight-jacketed into writing traditional music.&nbsp;<br/>best<br/>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Fri, 5/7/10, genewardsmith &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net">genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Sleep (SATB) example of using minor 2nds--Typos fixed<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Friday, May 7, 2010, 6:11 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Cox Franklin &lt;franklincox@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&quot;We&quot; recognize certain works as classics and use them as models for what we do at present. &Acirc;&nbsp;This is how vital cultural traditions tend to work.</p><p>I think some classic 20th century symphonies are those of Elgar, Sibelius, Vaughan Williams, and Shostakovich.

Just recently in the message I wrote to you I mentioned common usage of minor seconds in 12TET.  However I did present another alternative...the idea of using intervals around 12/11 instead of the 17/16-ish 12TET half step in order to increase the variety of consonant minor second chords possible.  In other words I agree 12TET actually has many more possibilities than I originally thought, but still think micro-tonal alternatives can improve upon 12TETs minor second chord flexibility...if not as much as I originally thought it could.</p><p>   What I haven&apos;t heard is someone, for example, honestly evaluating the reason-ability of use of &quot;semi minor seconds&quot; like 12/11 and/or of a completely different alternative to 17/16...something that could help extend the range of chords possible in pop music using micro-tonality.   Hence we&apos;ve had a lot of hoopla about &quot;why 12TET is valid&quot; and very few attempts at solving the issue of using micro-tonality to extend the bounds of pop music via things like new consonant chords and getting average musicians interested in micro-tonality.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And now it&apos;s &quot;I think if we use scales with neutral seconds we&apos;ll be able to make cool euphonic cluster chords approximating 9:10:11:12 and the like, thus providing a neat way for microtonal music to catch on in popular music.&quot; This is a far cry from your original argument, which had something to do with critical bands and dissonance.&quot;<br/>    No, they are both directly related.  The main reason I&apos;m championing the ideal of &quot;neutral seconds&quot; like 12/11 is that they obviously have so much less critical band dissonance than 17/16 (which can be considered as &quot;emulating&quot; the 15/14 in diatonic JI).  In fact 12/11 is at a &quot;dissonance trough/minimum&quot; on Elrich&apos;s Harmonic Entropy curve while Sethares&apos; dissonance curve as generated for harmonic timbres has a low area near 11/10 to 9/8...and between the two theories, the whole 12/11-10/9 area is a relative dissonance low point.  I figure it&apos;s one thing pop music could take advantage of, though I&apos;m eager to hear other ideas on things like minor second and/or other interval alternatives as well. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;Also, it&apos;s not &quot;micro-tonal, &quot; it&apos;s &quot;microtonal, &quot; and I take offense to the former.&quot;<br/>My spell checker says it&apos;s micro-tonal but fair enough...I&apos;ll use &quot;microtonal&quot; from now on.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=88865 href="#88865">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 7:43:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>=&gt;Michael &quot;we&apos;ve had a lot of hoopla about &quot;why 12TET is valid&quot; &quot;</p><p>Pray tell what does &quot;12 TET is valid&quot; mean?</p><p>Chris</p></div><h3><a id=88866 href="#88866">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 8:22:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris&gt;&quot;Pray tell what does &quot;12 TET is valid&quot; mean?&quot;<br/>The idea that the whole and complete answer to my question of how to introduce micro-tonality to the public is &quot;don&apos;t&quot; or even &quot;what a ridiculous idea&quot;.</p><p>    It&apos;s pretty much been the only thing consistent about this thread...I&apos;ve asked for either ways to use my ideas or alternatives given by list members for helping adopt use of new ways to get micro-tonality into the public eye but by and large the response has been along the lines of...</p><p>A)   You can already do that in 12TET...indirectly implying there&apos;s no reason to seek alternatives (kind of odd considering this a micro-tuning forum and not a 12TET ones)<br/>B1)  You need to learn more of what is possible in 12TET (even though 12TET, for example, does not even include the 12/11 neutral second ratio suggestion I posed...for example)<br/>B2)  The key to figuring out said issue in B1 (which I never asked about in the first place and doesn&apos;t really help improve the accessibility of micro-tonal music) lies in music history (giving examples of many historic composers).  And (perhaps) it follows that even if you&apos;re composing for the present you should aim for the styles of the past (which to me is an incredibly whimsical way to market micro-tonal awareness in many if not most cases).<br/>C)    Making microtonal music accessible to the public is pretty much impossible  -Jon<br/>D)    We supposedly already have tons of networking-connections through the classical scene and such a scene expands more than you/&quot;Mike&quot; give it credit for (even though, if that&apos;s so and there&apos;s little to improve about &quot;getting micro-tonal out of just mostly classical music&quot;...you&apos;d think micro-tonal would be a LOT more popular than it is).</p><p>    So people on this topic have gone on and on and on....about &quot;Why my/Mike&apos;s cause for promoting micro-tonality&apos;s popularity is helpless and pointless&quot; and supposedly why I&apos;m just ignorant for not &quot;accepting that any ideas for using things like new intervals, new chords, and reaching out to the popular music world are invalid...and the only thing valid revolves around 12TET&quot;.

I NEVER EVER said or implied my scale was an all-encompassing theory...I simply posed it as an alternative.  I&apos;m NOT looking to monopolize music theory in any way...and firmly believe things like my theory can peacefully co-exists with 22TET octa-tonic scales, Hexanies scales, 17TET, 1/4 comma mean-tone, diatonic JI, and a whole lot of theories I also believe could be leading forces in popularizing micro-tonal music.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you want to avoid critical band dissonance as an artistic tool, go for it. It&apos;s like impressionistic painters avoiding sharp lines or something like that. But to elevate that as a theory for how all music<br/>must work is a bit of a stretch.&quot;<br/>   I actually wouldn&apos;t say any one theory describes how music must work...including JI (which many people seem to think is the single defining theory of all consonant music).  Rather I think it&apos;s an artistic balance between JI, critical band dissonance, mirroring, proportionate difference tones, variety of tones (more) vs. ease of memory for tones (less) in a scale, tonal color vs. periodicity, potential masking effects between tones, and a whole bunch of other theories we simply haven&apos;t discovered.</p><p>     On top of it I believe we have systems which ultimately simply make compromises between theories such as the above to fit a musician&apos;s taste and try to gain as many benefits as possible without compromises.  Perhaps the example of &quot;perfect adherence to a theory&quot; is making a scale BE the harmonic series for JI, making a scale be only multiples of the octave for &quot;perfect avoidance of critical band dissonance&quot;, or making a scale with unlimited tones for &quot;perfect tonal color&quot;.  Each option that perfectly complies with a theory without balance between theories, for that reason, I believe turns out to be quite lifeless and boring.  The fascination in micro-tonality to a large extent for me comes from finding creative ways to balance between the theories...and the fact there are so many ways to achieve different types of good balance means there can obviously be a good few &quot;leading&quot; scales.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=88876 href="#88876">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 11:27:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; =&gt;Michael &quot;we&apos;ve had a lot of hoopla about &quot;why 12TET is valid&quot; &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pray tell what does &quot;12 TET is valid&quot; mean?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris</p><p>Chris, honestly, do you really want to know?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=88877 href="#88877">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 11:27:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Cox Franklin &lt;franklincox@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Michael,<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no point in continuing this discussion. &nbsp;If you want the<br/>&gt; last word, fine, I can see that you&apos;re going to have it at all<br/>&gt; costs.</p><p>Oh, he will.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=88884 href="#88884">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 12:51:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dr. Cox&gt;<br/>&gt; Michael,<br/>&gt; there&apos;s no point in continuing this discussion.

Prepare yourself!  All of the following scales I have selected according to the following criteria:<br/>1. Logical structure to make learning easy (i.e. nothing &quot;arbitrarily chosen according to one person&apos;s aesthetics).<br/>2. Relatively easy to apply to existing instruments (i.e. nothing with an intimidating number of pitches, nothing too &quot;non-ergonomic&quot;).<br/>3. Has at least some basis in theoretical consonance--i.e. for any interval rendered LESS consonant than its 12-tET counterpart, some other interval must be rendered MORE consonant than its 12-tET counterpart.<br/>4. Has at least SOME aspect that will be familiar to the average musician.<br/>5. Has at least SOME ability to deviate significantly from sounding like 12-tET.</p><p>So, without further ado:</p><p>EDOs:<br/>15- and 16-EDO both improve 5-limit and 7-limit harmony (at the expense of the 3-limit), do not add significantly more pitches than 12-tET, provide some familiar harmonies but deviate extremely from traditional melodic structures, and have simple proposed Halberstadt-esque keyboard designs that would not be too difficult to &quot;hack&quot; onto a mass-produced keyboard if one doesn&apos;t mind taking it apart.  Both are easy to apply on guitar as well.  Google &quot;pentadecaphonic&quot; and &quot;armodue&quot; to see proposed keyboards and theoretical structures for these two.</p><p>17- and 19-EDO both preserve familiar 3-limit harmonies while either adding some 11- and 13-limit intervals (17-EDO) or improving 5-limit harmonies and adding some additional dissonances in the form of some poorly-approximated septimal intervals (19-EDO).  Both are compatible with standard notation and can play 12-tone music just fine, and both are still within a manageable number of pitches for the average musician.</p><p>24-EDO preserves everything people like about 12 while adding a host of 11-limit intervals, and performing only slightly worse than 19-EDO in the 7-limit.  New scales like the &quot;mohajira&quot; neutral-third scale are possible.  Still manageable on a guitar, though just barely, and at least somewhat sensible when applied to a halberstadt keyboard (2 octaves of keyboard becomes one acoustical octave).</p><p>18&apos;s potential I&apos;m still evaluating.  20 is not very ergonomic on guitar, though I like it just fine and it sounds better than 15.  14 is actually pretty tricky to apply on guitar, scale-wise.  13 won&apos;t win any beauty contests, 21, 22 &amp; 23 are probably too unwieldy for the average musician despite sounding really good, and anything above 24 will probably turn off the average musician for being &quot;too many notes&quot;.  10-EDO or 7-EDO might actually turn some people on, though.</p><p>JI:<br/>Any 13-limit (or lower) CPS or tonality diamond with a manageable (i.e. &lt;24) number of pitches, such as Wilson&apos;s Eikosany, will provide plenty of consonant chords arrayed according to a logical (read: easy to learn and understand) mathematical structure.  Any JI scale has the disadvantage of being difficult to apply to a guitar, but for under 24 pitches, a reconfigured halberstadt keyboard is still possible.  Marimbas and tubulongs are easy enough to build, and there is some theoretical support for these tunings/scales.</p><p>A 5-limit 12-tone JI scale, such as that used in Terry Riley&apos;s &quot;The Harp of New Albion&quot; can also sound appreciably different from 12-tET, especially with chords further out on the spiral of fifths.  Just look at what a scale of 1/1-16/15-9/8-6/5-5/4-4/3-45/32-3/2-8/5-5/3-9/5-15/8-2/1 looks like if you take the 45/32 as the tonic!  This allows players the ability to select how &quot;xenharmonic&quot; they wish to sound by changing keys.  Easy on a keyboard, still tough on guitar...but hey, Dante Rosati managed it by himself on the cheap, so it can be done!</p><p>An octave of the harmonic or subharmonic series, probably at least harmonics 12-24 and at most 24-48.  Has the advantage of mathematical consistency (all ratios will share a common numerator or denominator), but has the disadvantage of musical inconsistency (scales are VERY improper, any species of chord occurs only once in the scale, and steps &quot;bunch up&quot; near 1/1 or 2/1)...but hey, the harmonic series &quot;makes sense&quot; in a way MANY JI scales don&apos;t!</p><p>Non-Octaves:<br/>88-cET or any of the Wendy Carlos scales (alpha, beta, gamma) can go from mild to wild, but are still manageable in number of notes and plenty consonant.  There&apos;s even some good music that has been written in them!  Easy to apply on a guitar or a generalized/hex keyboard.  Still a bit difficult for most people to conceptualize, though, as the loss of a real &quot;equivalence&quot; interval means the number of distinct notes goes through the roof, unless one just &quot;decides&quot; to consider some other interval an equivalence.</p><p>Bohlen-Pierce: I&apos;m not really a fan, but it&apos;s the most popular non-Octave tuning in the world and there&apos;s lots of theoretical support for it, as well as an active community of enthusiasts and a few good musical examples (see Elaine Walker/Zia).</p><p>I can&apos;t think of any scales more easily-applicable, commercially-viable, and community-supported than these.</p><p>So maybe, instead of trying to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;, Michael, you could give a try at writing some &quot;hits&quot; in one of these?</p><p>HTH.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=88905 href="#88905">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 6:13:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    Ah ok...now it makes much more sense.

Actually, ever since I found out about Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales I&apos;ve been very interested in neutral seconds...and I may very well write a piece in a &quot;Mohaijira subset&quot; of 24TET.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Just look at what a scale of 1/1-16/15-9/ 8-6/5-5/4- 4/3-45/32-<br/>3/2-8/5-5/ 3-9/5-15/ 8-2/1 looks like if you take the 45/32 as the<br/>tonic! This allows players the ability to select how &quot;xenharmonic&quot; they<br/>wish to sound by changing keys.&quot;<br/>  Very cool...so you can scale your desired level of xenharmonicity.  Agreed that&apos;s a very desirable feature for a tuning to have.  Although I&apos;ve found 5-limit rather narrow so far as tonal color in the past.</p><p>&gt;&quot;but (harmonic series scales) have the disadvantage of musical inconsistency (scales are VERY<br/>improper, any species of chord occurs only once in the scale, and steps<br/>&quot;bunch up&quot; near 1/1 or 2/1)&quot;<br/>    Right...plus you have things like tonal color compromised.  At one point I gave the thought of harmonic series scales serious consideration because of ease of learning and how it&apos;s virtually impossible to make sour chords to an extent, but gave up due to lack of tonal flexibility and single-dimensional feel.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Bohlen-Pierce: I&apos;m not really a fan, but it&apos;s the most popular<br/>non-Octave tuning in the world and there&apos;s lots of theoretical support<br/>for it, as well as an active community of enthusiasts and a few good<br/>musical examples (see Elaine Walker/Zia).&quot;<br/>    Agreed it sounds very pristine and there&apos;s tons of support for it IE to me it seems as easy to learn or easier to learn than 12TET.  It&apos;s one of those odd tunings...great for pop music, yet almost sounding too typical for my ears to want to write a lot of personal pieces for it...kind of like using 12TET as a painting and then taking its negative.</p><p>&gt;&quot;15- and 16-EDO both improve 5-limit and 7-limit harmony (at the expense<br/>of the 3-limit), do not add significantly more pitches than 12-tET,<br/>provide some familiar harmonies but deviate extremely from traditional<br/>melodic structures&quot;<br/>   Cool, I&apos;m a fan of 7-limit and think the added tonal color is more than worth the 3-limit loss.<br/>Plus I loaded up the scale and found a lot of ratios I like, including<br/>1.09683 (decent 12/11 to 11/10 minor second approximation)<br/>1.20303 (excellent 6/5 approximation)<br/>1.38191 (very good 11/8 approximation)<br/>1.515 (one of my favorite &quot;alternative 5ths)<br/>1.66248 (excellent 5/3 approximation)<br/>1.7411 (good 7/4 approximation)<br/>1.82345 (good 11/6 approximation)<br/>   I&apos;m going to have to try composing in this one...looks (and sounds from your description) like a pretty well balanced tuning.</p><p>&gt;&quot;JI: Any 13-limit (or lower) CPS or tonality diamond with a manageable (i.e.<br/>&lt;24) number of pitches, such as Wilson&apos;s Eikosany, will provide<br/>plenty of consonant chords&quot;<br/>  I&apos;ll have to look up Wilson&apos;s Eikosany and try it.  My experience with Wilson&apos;s scales in the past has been quite good...though often I find JI ends up hitting some chords almost too perfectly (read too much periodicity buzz) and comes out more shaky melodically than TET scales.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So maybe, instead of trying to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;, Michael, you could give a try at writing some &quot;hits&quot; in one of these?&quot;<br/>  Indeed I will.  In fact...my first micro-tonal song ever was in 19TET, my second in 24TEt, and my third in 34TET...but even looking back I didn&apos;t particularly like those tunings, though I&apos;m revisiting 24TET after I&apos;ve learned the cool things it can do with neutral seconds on top of its &quot;copy of 12TET&quot; interval abilities.<br/>  However, I&apos;ve heard some great music in 17TET, Wilson&apos;s scales, BP, 7TET, and a good few other tunings...and it&apos;s probably time a gave composing with existing tunings another shot...hopefully with the knowledge and feel of intervals I&apos;ve gained from making my own scales I&apos;ll manage better results this time around.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=88909 href="#88909">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 6:59:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alright, you want accessible microtonal scales that could be used in pop music?  Prepare yourself!  All of the following scales I have selected according to the following criteria:<br/>&gt; 1. Logical structure to make learning easy (i.e. nothing &quot;arbitrarily chosen according to one person&apos;s aesthetics).<br/>&gt; 2. Relatively easy to apply to existing instruments (i.e. nothing with an intimidating number of pitches, nothing too &quot;non-ergonomic&quot;).<br/>&gt; 3. Has at least some basis in theoretical consonance--i.e. for any interval rendered LESS consonant than its 12-tET counterpart, some other interval must be rendered MORE consonant than its 12-tET counterpart.<br/>&gt; 4. Has at least SOME aspect that will be familiar to the average musician.<br/>&gt; 5. Has at least SOME ability to deviate significantly from sounding like 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, without further ado:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; EDOs:<br/>&gt; 15- and 16-EDO both improve 5-limit and 7-limit harmony (at the expense of the 3-limit), do not add significantly more pitches than 12-tET, provide some familiar harmonies but deviate extremely from traditional melodic structures, and have simple proposed Halberstadt-esque keyboard designs that would not be too difficult to &quot;hack&quot; onto a mass-produced keyboard if one doesn&apos;t mind taking it apart.  Both are easy to apply on guitar as well.  Google &quot;pentadecaphonic&quot; and &quot;armodue&quot; to see proposed keyboards and theoretical structures for these two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17- and 19-EDO both preserve familiar 3-limit harmonies while either adding some 11- and 13-limit intervals (17-EDO) or improving 5-limit harmonies and adding some additional dissonances in the form of some poorly-approximated septimal intervals (19-EDO).  Both are compatible with standard notation and can play 12-tone music just fine, and both are still within a manageable number of pitches for the average musician.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 24-EDO preserves everything people like about 12 while adding a host of 11-limit intervals, and performing only slightly worse than 19-EDO in the 7-limit.  New scales like the &quot;mohajira&quot; neutral-third scale are possible.  Still manageable on a guitar, though just barely, and at least somewhat sensible when applied to a halberstadt keyboard (2 octaves of keyboard becomes one acoustical octave).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 18&apos;s potential I&apos;m still evaluating.  20 is not very ergonomic on guitar, though I like it just fine and it sounds better than 15.  14 is actually pretty tricky to apply on guitar, scale-wise.  13 won&apos;t win any beauty contests, 21, 22 &amp; 23 are probably too unwieldy for the average musician despite sounding really good, and anything above 24 will probably turn off the average musician for being &quot;too many notes&quot;.  10-EDO or 7-EDO might actually turn some people on, though.</p><p>&gt; Bohlen-Pierce: I&apos;m not really a fan, but it&apos;s the most popular non-Octave tuning in the world and there&apos;s lots of theoretical support for it, as well as an active community of enthusiasts and a few good musical examples (see Elaine Walker/Zia).</p><p>Not only that, but it can be used as a &quot;modality&quot; of 41 equal, and suddenly you&apos;ve got octaves after all.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t think of any scales more easily-applicable, commercially-viable, and community-supported than these.</p><p>Geez, I can.

I speak from experience, being that I&apos;ve showed off my microtonal guitarsenal to many many guitarists--quite a few who&apos;d describe themselves as &quot;adventurous&quot; and more than a few conservatory-trained--and even the 22-EDO drew more looks of fear and disgust (&quot;how can you PLAY a guitar like that?&quot;) than interest or excitement; by contrast, most people found the 17-tone quite approachable and fascinating.

There seem to be a lot of people obsessed with harmonic purity, who would be willing to deal with the bent/split frets for the sake of having everything &quot;in tune&quot;; the same can&apos;t be said of people who are just looking for freaky new scales, it would seem.</p><p>Yeah, I&apos;ll concede lots of them sound better than 15, 16, 17, or 19-EDO, and if the guitar (i.e. probably the most popular/iconic instrument of American musical pop culture) is taken out of the equation, linear temps definitely outshine any of the EDOs I suggested, and probably even a lot of JI.

The further you ask a guitarist to deviate from what he or she is used to, the better the &quot;payoff&quot; has to be.  Yet I maintain that the issue with linear temperaments on a guitar is that they provide all the &quot;headache&quot; of JI without the reward of purely-tuned intervals.

The appeal seems to be lacking, and I suspect it is for the reasons I&apos;ve stated: all the complications of JI without the harmonic purity.</p><p>I&apos;m also reflecting on my induction to the microtonal world...to answer the question of marketability, perhaps we should be reflecting on what &quot;sold us&quot; in the first place.  I&apos;m willing to bet &quot;linear temperaments&quot; other than meantone are an uncommon gateway drug.</p><p>Not that I am in any way disparaging linear temperaments--I just don&apos;t see their &quot;selling points&quot; as strong enough to compete in the marketplace with equal tunings or JI.</p><p>&gt; The thickest fishing line I could find was still thinner than the<br/>&gt; frets that came off.  I couldn&apos;t get barre chords with the 12+1<br/>&gt; meantone (above).</p><p>Hmm...I used 80-lb test I picked up at a local drug store.  Smaller than the original frets but still works just fine!  I&apos;ll be happy to send you the rest of my roll if you want to give it another go.  I don&apos;t see myself hooking any marlins in the near future.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=88937 href="#88937">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2010 4:55:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, I&apos;m not saying it can&apos;t be done!

That means the 5-limit is still OK, but let&apos;s face it, that&apos;s awfully limiting. The only really all-purpose, utility rank one temperaments in the size range are 12, 19 and 22.

But then, they mostly don&apos;t know how. Rank two temperaments, as we&apos;ve been discussing, do have many systems which work in the 24 notes or less to the octave size range which we seem to want to focus on. And it&apos;s not true that there aren&apos;t any pure sounds in there--orwell is often tuned by 53 or 84, for gosh sake, and it shows up already with nine note MOS. There are plenty more possibilities, and people who like synchronized beating, as you may have noticed with recent discussions, are at their happiest in rank two, where these are easiest to work out.</p></div><h3><a id=88943 href="#88943">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2010 8:25:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Michael, you seem to prefer a gamelan sound (to my ears)&quot;<br/>    Admittedly, that&apos;s me &quot;timbre cheating&quot; a bit (not Setharesian timbre cheating...but something in-between).<br/>    15TET does have some timbre-to-root-tone clashing/&quot;bite&quot; in some places and that lead, I found, counters that better than many other instruments.

Upon blind testing it vs. the nearby 7/4 and 5/3 intervals (even though I admitted myself on your 21 consonant tones post it sounded both good and different from 12TET)...the 12/7 actually doesn&apos;t sound very concordant to me at all (though perhaps that&apos;s partly personal preference)...it sounds to me like a weak tone that can&apos;t decide if it wants to be a 7/4 or 5/3.</p><p>So, far as consonant intervals that are different out of your set vs. 12TET, I&apos;d say<br/>1)  The 8/7-7/6 range<br/>2)  9/7<br/>3) 7/4<br/>...really 3 new/different types/&quot;classes&quot; of sound that are also quite concordant...at least to my ears.

I ran into this in several of my old attempts to boost my 7-tone scales up into 12+-tone ones.  Thus, to achieve such difference without making a lot of sour intervals, I&apos;d highly recommend making a new scale within the 7-9 tone range...rather than a &quot;transpose-able&quot; tuning like the one your NPT scale fits under.

In my system the<br/>&gt; following &quot;good&quot; intervals occur and how they differ from 12TET in<br/>&gt; cents is shown...<br/>&gt; 8/7.....31.2cents<br/>&gt; 7/6.....33.1cents<br/>&gt; 9/7.....35.1cents<br/>&gt; 12/7....33.1cents<br/>&gt; 7/4.....31.2cents&quot;&lt;<br/>&gt;     Well the 7/6 and 8/7 I&apos;d count as not at all far from the same (just I do with the combining 12/11 11/10 and somewhat the 10/9 interval I like so much as a &quot;range&quot; rather than 3 unique tones).<br/>&gt;      The 9/7 is notably different in sound than anything in 12TET.  Upon blind testing it vs. the nearby 7/4 and 5/3 intervals (even though I admitted myself on your 21 consonant tones post it sounded both good and different from 12TET)...the 12/7 actually doesn&apos;t sound very concordant to me at all (though perhaps that&apos;s partly personal preference)...it sounds to me like a weak tone that can&apos;t decide if it wants to be a 7/4 or 5/3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, far as consonant intervals that are different out of your set vs. 12TET, I&apos;d say<br/>&gt; 1)  The 8/7-7/6 range<br/>&gt; 2)  9/7<br/>&gt; 3) 7/4<br/>&gt; ...really 3 new/different types/&quot;classes&quot; of sound that are also quite concordant...at least to my ears.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s not bad (I&apos;ve seen many mean-tone and JI scales with maybe one &quot;significantly different from 12TET but still very concordant&quot; interval...but I am not sure it&apos;s enough variety of new intervals to get people to notice it just upon listening.   I&apos;d say something more like 7 completely unique new corcordant intervals (possible within 2 octaves space) would probably get their attention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I would love to include 11/8, 11/7, 11/6 and 13/7 in my system but<br/>&gt; (because I&apos;m going for 12 keys per octave) if I do substitute them for<br/>&gt; the other &quot;usual&quot; notes, far fewer good intervals (and therefore fewer<br/>&gt; musical possibilities) would occur.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Agreed.  I ran into this in several of my old attempts to boost my 7-tone scales up into 12+-tone ones.  Thus, to achieve such difference without making a lot of sour intervals, I&apos;d highly recommend making a new scale within the 7-9 tone range...rather than a &quot;transpose-able&quot; tuning like the one your NPT scale fits under.

Then you can play Orwell-9 on the open<br/>strings and first three frets.  It does mean a total of 6 generators<br/>between strings, so 13 frets won&apos;t obviously give you the same 9 notes<br/>on each string.  Maybe there&apos;s a workaround but it depends on what you<br/>want the other frets to do.</p><p>The big problem with Orwell generators is that they&apos;re so small.  You<br/>end up with things like 5:6:7:8 being playable but not 3:4:5.</p><p>&gt;&gt; There&apos;s a flexibility to the strings. &nbsp;Maybe you&apos;d need to buy two<br/>&gt;&gt; sets for one guitar. &nbsp;Then you&apos;ll have some spare high-E strings to<br/>&gt;&gt; replace the ones that always break on standard guitars.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I&apos;m not saying it can&apos;t be done! &nbsp;However, this isn&apos;t a thread<br/>&gt; on the feasibility of applying linear temperaments to guitar, it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; thread on the most &quot;marketable&quot; microtonal scales we can<br/>&gt; come up with. &nbsp;The further you ask a guitarist to deviate from<br/>&gt; what he or she is used to, the better the &quot;payoff&quot; has to be. &nbsp;Yet<br/>&gt; I maintain that the issue with linear temperaments on a guitar<br/>&gt; is that they provide all the &quot;headache&quot; of JI without the reward of<br/>&gt; purely-tuned intervals. &nbsp;Sure, linear temperaments are<br/>&gt; theoretically simpler than JI because they lack &quot;comma problems&quot;<br/>&gt; (though those don&apos;t seem to bother some composers); but in<br/>&gt; practical application they really aren&apos;t any simpler.</p><p>The payoff for Orwell is pretty high.  You get reasonable 11-limit<br/>harmony, every 9-limit interval better than 12-equal, few &quot;wolf&quot;<br/>intervals, a proper MOS in the Miller limit (7 +/- 2) and a guitar<br/>fretting that will give barre chords.  The argument is that it was a<br/>nice idea for keyboards but wouldn&apos;t work on guitars.  I say that<br/>doesn&apos;t follow at all.</p><p>Of course it&apos;s different.  If guitarists don&apos;t want to deviate from<br/>what they&apos;re used to, they&apos;d better stick with 12-equal, or a slight<br/>variation.  Any change and there&apos;ll be something they expect to work<br/>that doesn&apos;t.</p><p>The standard open string tuning is a fundamental problem outside of<br/>meantone.  It assumes the syntonic comma is tempered out.  There&apos;s no<br/>way of getting standard chords to work without some kind of meantone<br/>temperament.  And as soon as you lose the standard chords the<br/>guitarists have to relearn.  You may as well be bold and give them<br/>something worth learning.</p><p>Linear temperaments are practically simpler than JI on a guitar.  That<br/>shows itself by giving you more chords on open strings and fewer (if<br/>any) partial or narrowly spaced frets.  They also give more purity<br/>than equal temperaments of equivalent size.  The small intervals of<br/>Orwell-13 are roughly 53-equal (or commas) but the large intervals<br/>make the fretboard much easier to navigate than having 53 frets to the<br/>octave, and the 11-limit tuning&apos;s better than 53-equal.  Magic-19<br/>gives 9-limit harmony about as pure as a guitar can deliver with no<br/>commas.</p><p>&gt; Really, I&apos;m just observing some well-established trends here:<br/>&gt; there&apos;s quite a bunch of JI guitarists out there, and<br/>&gt; comparatively-fewer EDO and EDONOI guitarists, but aside from<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve heard of ANY strict-non-EDO<br/>&gt; linear-temperament guitarists who&apos;ve actually produced music<br/>&gt; with their instruments. &nbsp;The appeal seems to be lacking, and<br/>&gt; I suspect it is for the reasons I&apos;ve stated: all the complications<br/>&gt; of JI without the harmonic purity.</p><p>I think this is still online.  It&apos;s up to you to decide if it<br/>qualifies as music:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/music/noisy.mp3">http://x31eq.com/music/noisy.mp3</a></p><p>Magic and Orwell were completely unknown 10 years ago.  They&apos;re still<br/>very little known to the average guitarist, or even microtonal<br/>guitarist.  The only attempt to get a fretting specific to either was<br/>my fishing line job last year, which I had to put aside to get music<br/>done with Tripod Notation and a keyboard.  Some of you have used<br/>Orwell subsets on equally tempered guitars, which is interesting, but<br/>doesn&apos;t give you the purity.</p><p>Miracle was an obscure, unnamed temperament sitting in Xenharmonikon<br/>10 years ago.  Since then, I think there have been Blackjack<br/>prototypes, but not in America where the trends for both JI and EDO<br/>guitars are established.  I have no knowledge of any guitarists saying<br/>the result isn&apos;t harmonically pure enough.  I do, in fact, have word<br/>of an American building a Miracle-31 (Canasta) guitar, so we&apos;ll see<br/>how that goes.  You can well argue that it&apos;d be too complex, but the<br/>same goes double for JI.  Really.</p><p>Schismatic&apos;s interesting in theory, but it has the same comma problems<br/>as JI.  It&apos;s so close to 5-limit JI that I don&apos;t think it offers any<br/>advantages.</p><p>Pajara&apos;s good, but it works with 22-equal.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m also reflecting on my induction to the microtonal world...to<br/>&gt; answer the question of marketability, perhaps we should be<br/>&gt; reflecting on what &quot;sold us&quot; in the first place. &nbsp;I&apos;m willing to bet<br/>&gt; &quot;linear temperaments&quot; other than meantone are an uncommon<br/>&gt; gateway drug.</p><p>Of course they&apos;re uncommon.  Nobody knows about them.</p><p>&gt; Not that I am in any way disparaging linear temperaments--I just<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see their &quot;selling points&quot; as strong enough to compete in<br/>&gt; the marketplace with equal tunings or JI.</p><p>What sense does it make to categorize tunings like that?  Equal<br/>tunings have their advantages, if you&apos;re going to use all the notes.<br/>But if you take subsets they look exactly like regular temperaments.<br/>JI is a big bag of tunings that have arbitrary rank and good<br/>harmonies.  Regular temperaments are the same.  Almost anything that<br/>works with JI can work with some regular temperament or other.  Some<br/>regular temperaments have a rank of 2, and that makes them easy to<br/>think about, so we concentrate on them.  Some are simple, some are<br/>precise.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The thickest fishing line I could find was still thinner than the<br/>&gt;&gt; frets that came off. &nbsp;I couldn&apos;t get barre chords with the 12+1<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone (above).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm...I used 80-lb test I picked up at a local drug store.<br/>&gt;&nbsp;Smaller than the original frets but still works just fine! &nbsp;I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt; happy to send you the rest of my roll if you want to give it<br/>&gt; another go. &nbsp;I don&apos;t see myself hooking any marlins in the<br/>&gt; near future.</p><p>Thanks, but I&apos;ve got plenty to keep myself busy with for now.
