Perhaps we could do a patent<br/>search and see if some useful part of the algorithm is described<br/>somewhere. My description to you is simply a high-level and slightly<br/>oversimplified mathematical account of what Melodyne is doing. We know<br/>it&apos;s a time-frequency representation because that&apos;s what the concept<br/>of &quot;notes in time&quot; entails. We know that they represent complex tones<br/>rather than sinusoids because it coalesces a harmonic series into a<br/>single note. So that, mathematically, is what Melodyne entails.</p><p>After thinking more about it, it might be possible to work it out with<br/>an orthogonal setup - I thought that the fact that, say, a 400 Hz tone<br/>in isolation could be 400, 200, 133, 100, 80 etc Hz meant that the<br/>basis vectors themselves had to be non-orthogonal, but you might be<br/>able to work it out either way.</p><p>What have you heard about Bessel functions?

Actually that video convinced me that this software is not<br/>worth $350.  Unless you were going to use it as a synthesis tool. I imagine<br/>you can do interesting artificial things with it.
