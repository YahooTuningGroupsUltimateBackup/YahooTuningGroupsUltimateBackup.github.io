I will get my hands on the retuned pianos Friday night to<br/>record some examples - if anyone has a simple example they&apos;d like to hear,<br/>email me and I will try to record it, but no promises.</p><p>the concert is part of a student conference going on this weekend, and so<br/>before the concert, at 7:30, I&apos;ll be giving a little demonstration of the<br/>tuning if anyone would like to hear it. I can give directions to Paine<br/>Hall if anyone needs them.</p><p>best --jon wild</p><p>---------- Forwarded message ----------<br/>Date: Thu, 27 Feb 2003 13:22:10 -0500<br/>From: Lesley Bannatyne &lt;<a href="mailto:bannatyn@fas.harvard.edu">bannatyn@fas.harvard.edu</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Fwd: hgnm concert announcement</p><p>Please come to the HARVARD GROUP FOR NEW MUSIC concert  Saturday,<br/>MARCH 1 at 8:00 pm at Paine Hall, presented in conjunction with the<br/>Graduate Music Forum Inter-School Student Conference.</p><p>PROGRAM:<br/>&gt; Premieres written by Robert Hasegawa and Christopher Honett for<br/>&gt; two pianos tuned to a special 19-tone system; new work by Ken Ueno;<br/>&gt; compositions by students from Brown, Hartt, Boston University, NEC and<br/>&gt; Longy.<br/>&gt; A Caglar Arsu Kucuk Bir Hayal: A Little Dream<br/>&gt; Christopher Honett: The Horrible Quiet<br/>&gt; Robert Hasegawa: Due Corde<br/>&gt; Mark Berger: Trio for Strings<br/>&gt;   --intermission--<br/>&gt; Ken Ueno: Zansetsu (for amplified voice &amp; vln w/electronics)<br/>&gt; Chen Ching-Chang: Paper Duet<br/>&gt; Joshua Walker: Untitled (for guitar and live processing)<br/>&gt; Colin Stack: Perpetual Dejavu<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Free and open to the public.
