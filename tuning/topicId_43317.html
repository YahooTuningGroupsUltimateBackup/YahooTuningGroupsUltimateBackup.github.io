I just<br/>couldn&apos;t get the umlaut to happen in an e-mail. J</p><p>Ibo: Btw, with Gr&Ouml;ningen (GrOEningen) we are sometimes leaving now the North<br/>German area to the &quot;middle-German&quot; Thuringian and Saxon<br/>tradition, which - in a few documented examples - turned earlier<br/>to well-temperaments and equal temperament.</p><p>JR: And of course &quot;equal temperament&quot; is a well-temperament.  The trend of<br/>&quot;unequal temperament&quot; in a circle of keys seems to have skipped Nederland,<br/>but not Thuringia and Anhalt-Sachsen, and parts of Saxony, Hamburg, and<br/>Lubeck.</p><p>Ibo: (After lengthy examples of his own&mldr;) What is your material?</p><p>JR: Beginning with a Columbia University Masters thesis called &quot;Bach&apos;s<br/>Tuning,&quot; I have made 5 visits to Germany, the last 4 to study the world of<br/>Bach and to eventually write a book called Bach&apos;s Tuning.  To that effect, I<br/>have performed or produced numerous Bach works in numerous tunings, always to<br/>prefer Werckmeister III for musical reasons.  As a musician, I believe the<br/>music reveals more than the book readings that musicologists are most<br/>sensitive to.  I don&apos;t mean to offend, but there is seldom a day that goes by<br/>when I am not still shocked that a musicologist has missed the boat on<br/>something that is &quot;obvious&quot; to certain musicians (and, of course, certain<br/>musicologists).<br/>  As you said, you don&apos;t need to bring Werckmeister into your<br/>&gt; dissertation.<br/>&gt; I would hate to upset your track to graduation. ;)</p><p>Ibo: Thanks for the concern - just wonder why I should not know, what<br/>belongs to my diss. topic or not.</p><p>JR: Now, I don&apos;t think you mean to get sarcastic, not with so many nice and<br/>juicy fact morsels below.  If you check above, I have used an ironic icon to<br/>indicate that I am not being &quot;earnestly&quot; serious.</p><p>&Oslash; However, there are other sources. Have you checked<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s own report of 1705 about the Groningen<br/>&gt; temperament change? It has just been published<br/>&gt; in English.</p><p>[Didn&apos;t find it - can you provide us with the bibliographical data)</p><p>I can only hope that the translators didn&apos;t mess it up further<br/>about (wrong) GrOningen, instead of (right) Gr&Ouml;ningen.</p><p>JR: Krieger, Marcos Fernando. Dissertation: An English Translation and<br/>Commentary on Andreas Werckmeister&apos;s Organun Gruningense Redivivum Oder<br/>kurtze Beschribung des in der Gruningischen Scholos-Kirchen beruhmten<br/>Orgel-Wercks Wie dasselbe anfangs erbauet und beschaffen gewesen: Und wie es<br/>antzo auf allergnaligsten Befehl Sr. Kon. Preuss. Majestat ist renovieret und<br/>merklich verbessert worden, University of Nebraska, 1998.</p><p>Ibo: It is however always more than advisable to read the facsimile.<br/>Many Germans nowadays misinterpret old German, because many words or<br/>idiomatic phrases changed meaning, sometimes slightly,<br/>sometimes more. Still some sentences, words might not be<br/>understood at all. I always wonder how much translators are aware<br/>about things like this.  The reprint is: Werckmeister, Andreas. Organum<br/>Gruningense redivivum. Quedlinburg and Aschersleben, 1705. Reprint, ed. Paul<br/>Smets. Mainz 1932.</p><p>JR: Thank you.  I have both, thanks to a recent visit to Indiana University<br/>Library.  You are quite right about reading Werckmeister&apos;s German.  Mizler<br/>and Huygens and Rasch have criticized Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;bad&quot; German.</p><p>However, I had the good fortune to stay with Herr Lichtwitz of the great<br/>library in Wolfenbuttal while making one of my travels.  His wife Vertrude<br/>was native to this area and good easily translate aloud in almost real time.<br/>She found Werckmeister&apos;s writing - and I concurred - funny and erudite.<br/>There were many double entendres and &quot;paradoxes.&quot;</p><p>Ibo: Werckmeister does not specify any precise temperament to which<br/>that organ had been retuned. However he mentions only precisely<br/>that the organ was tuned before in the &quot;old, so called Praetorian&quot;<br/>temperament (i. e. meantone)</p><p>JR: Wasn&apos;t it his pride to write things up because his temperament was<br/>chosen?  Why else?</p><p>&Oslash; Werckmeister doesn&apos;t mention other people enough (everyone<br/>&gt; he does mention is listed in Walther&apos;s Lexicon).</p><p>Ibo: The retuning in Gr&ouml;ningen which Werckmeister<br/>vaguely describes was a single case, not representative at all for<br/>the temperament practice. Not even in W.&apos;s region - as several<br/>known examples up to the late 1730s show.</p><p>JR: So here, you seem to accept the logic of a single case.  We must take one<br/>at a time.  For me, it is with Bach that I can begin to check other cases.<br/>There is a logic in using Werckmeister III in his music that I will attempt<br/>to expose sometime soon.  I am sorry, I must disagree with some of your<br/>assumptions about Central German churches and their temperament.  There are<br/>more churches per square inch in this area than anywhere on earth, and so<br/>many church organs where a chromatacist as Bach could be welcomed.</p><p>Ibo: In the North the same development starts and can be seen between<br/>ca. 1760-1830 (+- 20 years) - since it came so late in the North,<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s ideas came often &quot;too late&quot; for retuning the still<br/>meantone organ - most often we can find indications of retunings<br/>from meantone directly into ET (with all the organ building<br/>problems I sketched above)</p><p>JR: The above is true in Holland, yes: but not Thuringia.  Werckmeister was<br/>not &quot;too late.&quot;  He was early.  His first publication was 1681 (the year<br/>Telemann was born in Magdeburg (which had been completely destroyed in 1631<br/>by the Thirty-years War).  Before he was to publish in Quedlinburg he<br/>travelled&mldr;.even to Amsterdam.  And he likely spoke Dutch!  He was a Johnny<br/>Appleseed of tuning ideas he had called a natural consequence of Praetorian<br/>quarter-comma meantone.  He doesn&apos;t claim to originate the idea, not does he<br/>name it.  In fact we don&apos;t have a face to put on him.</p><p>&gt; The organ builder Wender of Muhlhausen preferred to use<br/>&gt; Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Ibo: Nothing proves that - It is an assumption on shiny chronological<br/>and geographical coincidences</p><p>JR: It is musicology.</p><p>&Oslash; Ahle, Bach&apos;s predecessor in Muhlhausen, was indeed friends<br/>&gt; with W. (including things about W. in his prose and<br/>&gt; voluminous writings). It would appear</p><p>It would, yes, and might appear so to some.<br/>But the historical documents available until now on Wender do not<br/>back up the assumptions enough, to conclude which exact temperament<br/>he might have used.</p><p>JR: As I read it, you are endorsing a very conservative view, one that<br/>misattributes the influence of Andreas Werckmeister on early German music.<br/>There was no one before Werckmeister to present a tuning that would do what<br/>was musically necessary.  In some likelihood, Bach&apos;s uncle Johann Christoph<br/>Bach may have had one of those &quot;bumps&quot; into the 3-year younger Werckmeister.<br/>And Christoph spoke Dutch as well!</p><p>&Oslash; that Bach walked into an already tuned Werckmeister</p><p>Ibo: Nothing is known, which sufficiently would confirm this or support it.<br/>Do you know what the examination reports from these organ specify<br/>about the temperament?</p><p>JR: Have you never heard the difference between equal tempered Buxtehude and<br/>Werckmeister III tuned Buxtehude?  It is night and day.<br/>&Oslash; organ in both Arnstadt and Muhlhausen. No less<br/>&gt; than Kuhnau spoke of Wender&apos;s insistence on Werckmeister<br/>&gt; tuning.</p><p>Ibo: Please provide a reference for this: when did Kuhnau state this,<br/>and which exactly of Werckmeister&apos;s several temperaments does he<br/>refer to?</p><p>JR: It is from the Bach-archiv article you referenced.  And since Sorge and<br/>others have credited Werckmeister&apos;s third listing is his actual favorite,<br/>this is historically the better choice.  Musical Temperament (1691) gives<br/>quite short shrift to Werckmeister IV and V, etc.</p><p>It is important to point out that every single book Werckmeister published<br/>through 1707 refers back to his 1691 publication (which was sold in Leipzig<br/>and Frankfort).  He never failed to favor purer intervals in diatonic keys.</p><p>Incidentally, I just conducted &quot;Where is the newborn king of the Jews&quot; in<br/>Werckmeister III.  I liked his Christmas Cantata, mainly because it was fun<br/>and demonstrated well his skills in composition and form.  Two older women<br/>approached right afterwards asking where the microtones were.  I had to<br/>announce to the audience that it is quite interesting that the identifying<br/>name of Werckmeister with tuning was so conservative in his actual use of<br/>pitch relationships.</p><p>Ibo: Kuhnau worked in Leipzig, - around 1700 this was scarcely related<br/>to the - quite different - organ building practice of Northern<br/>Germany which I&apos;m researching.</p><p>JR: Maybe, but Kuhnau had the same basic interests as Werckmeister&mldr;and they<br/>were likely friends as well.</p><p>Ibo: If you can show the evidence for your statement by any reference,<br/>then it would point to a significant change in Kuhnau&apos;s position<br/>towards temperament: in 1717 he complains to Mattheson in a<br/>letter about the organ builder&apos;s Wender&apos;s and Silbermann&apos;s<br/>temperament practice, that they do not use the &quot;exact temperament&quot;<br/>of Neidhart (i. e. ET, as Neidhart specified it, from his other<br/>suggestions).</p><p>JR:  Thanks.  This is as good as saying: Wender is in Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>chromatic tuning.</p><p>Ibo: And the Silbermann researcher Frank Harald Gress pointed to<br/>Silbermann&apos;s usual application of some form of meantone<br/>temperament (probably 1/4-comma-meantone, or very close) in<br/>Silbermann&apos;s earlier decades (the later statement from Sorge about<br/>a 1/6-komma-temperament, must be seen in the biased light of the<br/>&quot;Temperaturen-Streit&quot; of the later 18th century! Sorge&apos;s<br/>description can&apos;t simply be taken literally for Silbermann&apos;s<br/>practice, as confirmed by other documents).</p><p>JR: Everyone is biased and no one is biased.  How can you disregard whom you<br/>like and whom you do not?  Now we believe Sorge, now we disbelieve<br/>Werckmeister: now, we reverse.  The musicology means little if after reading<br/>a big book one can only say it is all gook.</p><p>Ibo: Whatever temperament Wender actually might have applied, is not<br/>known or documented to my knowledge. The recent Bach-Jahrbuch<br/>article by Marcus Rathey unfortunately creates the impression from<br/>mere chronological and geographical coincidences and reasoning,<br/>without any proof and double checks from the organ&apos;s history.</p><p>JR: I will have to go back to Rathey to quote him, but I remember his having<br/>particular statements by Kuhnau and Ahle, connecting Wender to Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>tuning.</p><p>Ibo: And once same old soup again here, too: How much does an assumed<br/>friendship between Ahle and Werckmeister tell about Wender&apos;s (not documented)<br/>actual organ temperament in M&uuml;hlhausen? Nothing, of<br/>course - it is an interpretation by connecting<br/>non-temperament-related items. May be - may be not.</p><p>JR: From where I sit, mine is the important new research, while you are<br/>sitting on the status quo.</p><p>Ibo: For an free intonating instrument it is no advantage from another<br/>circulating temperament, since they only have to play pure above<br/>the lowest - as pure as possible: in practice that means, +-3 to<br/>5 cents around the pure (!) interval above the lowest note, which<br/>makes for that purpose all well-temperaments marginal in difference!</p><p>JR: We play accurate to the cent whenever possible, at least in the mind.<br/>The way you are discussing tuning, they all sound just about the same.  I do<br/>not hear that way, nor do I suspect Buxtehude did.  Nor did Bach.<br/>Werckmeister is ideal in every way to fit the missing link that is Thuringia.</p><p>Ibo: But an organ, was of course difficult to retune. Only to convince<br/>the church Elders to pay the money, could be the first part of the<br/>work, with which a project might have failed. As I said before:<br/>large, public payed organs, serving a function in a &quot;conservative&quot;<br/>society and liturgy were no lab for unprecedented temperament<br/>experiments, to change a ca. 250 years tradition</p><p>JR: Which is why a theologian like Werckmeister was ideally place to pave the<br/>way for well-temperament (a term that he coined in publication as<br/>&quot;Wohl-temperirt&quot;).  The church was on his side.</p><p>Any examples you have to the contrary will be of great interest to us.</p><p>Ibo:  Today, tape is may be a solution - But, contradicting is, that I<br/>have not seen any good baroque oboe player doing something like<br/>that to his instrument.</p><p>JR: How about Bram Kreeftmeijer of Arnhem.  He was my oboist for Brandenburg<br/>Concerto #2&mldr;and he used scotch tape that I procured.</p><p>Ibo: And what kind of tape would you suggest<br/>for the practice back then? I thought it is an invention of the<br/>20th century?</p><p>JR: Back then they had no keys on oboes.  One would have used beeswax on wind<br/>instruments.  On a modern bassoon playing Johann  Michael Bach&apos;s &quot;Ach bleib,&mldr;<br/>.,&quot; I used tape as well: it works flawlessly.</p><p>Ibo: I certainly can imagine that you were part of a great performance<br/>of concerted ensemble music, which you mention. But again, how<br/>exactly could an argument be drawn from your recent performance for<br/>the historical knowledge or narrowing in to the temperament<br/>practice (not theories, which were published, without that we know<br/>that they were practised) in North German church organs from the<br/>documented evidence, as reported for example in examination and<br/>other status reports etc.</p><p>JR: Your sentence above was too long for me to figure out how to respond to<br/>it.  Certainly, there is plenty of room for argument&mldr;of one type or another.<br/>As time unravels from last weeks concerts, many revelations unwrap, sort of<br/>like an onion peal.</p><p>&gt; for all the usage of Werckmeister.</p><p>of which Walther doesn&apos;t write even a tiny bit!</p><p>&gt; He&apos;s all over the place.</p><p>Ibo: Werckmeister&apos;s name in Walther&apos;s Lexicon? Yes<br/>- but not one hint on any Werckmeister-temperament, no example of<br/>any organ thus tuned is listed by Walther.</p><p>JR: We certainly have different eyes.  I see a whole page on Werckmeister and<br/>much less on most any other personage.  I see Werckmeister&apos;s name listed<br/>first in the article on &quot;Temperament,&quot; and I see Werckmeister&apos;s name listed<br/>to anything that Walther can find that would indeed connect.  But no, not to<br/>a specific organ.</p><p>&Oslash; And take a listen to Armin Shoof&apos;s</p><p>Schoof, the organist of the Jakobi church L&uuml;beck<br/>- he is a friend of mine, and we are here happy in GOArt to bea<br/>able to cooperating with himn and his parisch St. Jakobi, in an<br/>EU-project from our institution to try to save the fabulous small<br/>organ (1467/1637) in L&uuml;beck, St. Jakobi, from lead corrosion which<br/>started to destroy the oldest layer of the pipework (1467)</p><p>&gt; performances of Buxtehude on Lubeck&apos;s St. Jacobi Kirche.</p><p>What is your opinion:<br/>How does a (Schoof&apos;s) performance *today* tell us anything about<br/>the actual temperaments to be found in (North German) organs in<br/>Buxtehude&apos;s and Werckmeister&apos;s time?</p><p>JR: My opinion, and everyone that has heard Shoof&apos;s more recent Buxtehude albu<br/>m, is that it is a different piece than its equal tempered manifestations.<br/>Sequences have a life that are intended for subtle comparison, totally lost<br/>in ET.  People cry at the significant difference.  Please be sure to share<br/>this with Armin Shoof.</p><p>Ibo: And even if the Werckmeister temperament would unexpectedly have<br/>been heard from the organ in St. Jakobi in around 1700 in the<br/>organ(s) in St. Jakobi, it would not mean, that the organ(s) in<br/>the neighbouring church St. Marien, where Buxtehude worked, must<br/>have had a well-temperament.</p><p>JR: When, according to the records, was the St. Jakobi kleine orgel first<br/>tuned into Werckmeister III.  It is a middle ages era instrument so there<br/>must be records.</p><p>Ibo: Since, however, nothing points to a Werckmeister temperament in<br/>L&uuml;beck-Jakobi in Buxtehude&apos;s time, this example goes to the big bulk of<br/>unlikeliness.</p><p>JR: Once again, it appears there is some disconnect here.  One can hear the<br/>difference, though I admit it is difficult to make this clear through the<br/>internet.  But besides the listening, which is understandably suspect to you,<br/>Buxtehude wrote a poem dedicated to Werckmesiter.  It came in 1702, later<br/>than the 1691 Musicalische Temperatur.  He must have been a friend to write a<br/>stanza poem in Werckmeister&apos;s honor.  He must have been satisfied with what<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s tuning had to offer.  And he must have had the time to fully<br/>decide if it was of substantial importance to the creation of his own music.</p><p>Ibo: Yes, thanks - would be nice if we could see evidence from Walther,<br/>which would be really something new!</p><p>JR: When Walther wrote in a letter that &quot;Bach and Buxtehude were the &quot;only<br/>living German organists worthy of mention,&quot; it is significant.  Walther<br/>received his Buxtehude material directly from Werckmeister, personally, in<br/>Halberstadt.  That Bach walked to spend months with Buxtehude&apos;s music is also<br/>significant.  Rather than pine about what we cannot know, why not explore<br/>what we do know.  I hope you agree.</p><p>Ibo: But I can&apos;t find any place in Walther&apos;s lexicon, where he explicitly<br/>describes any temperament, neither theretical, nor that it is to be found<br/>here or there.</p><p>JR: It is traditional in the Thuringian/Harz tradition not to quote the work<br/>of other people when their works are published.  Werckmeister&apos;s writings were<br/>widely disbursed.</p><p>Ibo: And Walther&apos;s quite long entry on Werckmeister doesn&apos;t state<br/>anything of what we have discussed here, either (except of a list<br/>of Werckmeister&apos;s publications).</p><p>JR: Which means he had a huge amount of respect for Andreas Werckmeister, for<br/>all of his writings.  Walther mentions far less about most anyone else.<br/>There has been a veil place over Werckmeister and his importance to the music<br/>that followed.  In the English and Dutch speaking work, little has made a<br/>proper impact.  For reasons of the truth, my advice to you is to remain<br/>flexible.</p><p>Thanks<br/>best regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>my best to you, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
