For instance, in the Scala archive is<br/>something called &quot;smithgw_18.scl&quot;. This has five otonal and five<br/>utonal tetrads, and if you temper it via marvel, that goes up to six<br/>otonal and six utonal tetrads. This is pretty good for 18 notes. Is<br/>this a good scale? It is not epimorphic, and adding notes to it to<br/>make an epimorphic scale requires one to go up to 27 notes, which is a<br/>big difference. However, the ratio of largest to smallest step size<br/>(3.19) is not terribly unreasonable. The scale is clearly more<br/>irregular by various measures than Blackjack, but how regular does a<br/>scale of this size need to be?</p><p>I&apos;d be interested in hearing the viewpoints of scale end users.</p></div>
