You are writing about the basics of musical scales and temperaments. The<br/>matter has been researched ever since the Middle Ages and conspicuously in<br/>modern times, with important publications. It is agreed that a writing like<br/>yours should quote the main sources  (ancient and modern) upon which your<br/>statements are based, yet I cannot find any list of References/Literature in<br/>the webpage you mention in your email. Sorry cannot find it in other we<br/>bgpages of yours, though my search was not exhaustive: could you tell us<br/>where  they are? Thanks!</p><p>B. You write in that webpage:</p><p>&quot;this octave was subdivided in three basic ways;</p><p>1) By a geometric progression, with any number of equal <a href="http://intervals.Eg">intervals.Eg</a>. 12 (as<br/>on conventional guitars) [100 cents per semitone or interval]; 31 as<br/>advocated by Huyghens (1629-1695) [38.71 cents per interval], or 53 by<br/>Mercator and Bosanquet (1876 Treatise) [22.64 cents];</p><p>2) By  &lt;outbind://11/tuning/just_intonation.html&gt; low whole number ratios.<br/>Eg. (Just Intonation) 3:2 for the Vth; 5:4 for the major third etc.</p><p>3) By cumulative fifths. Eg.  &lt;outbind://11/tuning/pythagorean.html&gt;<br/>Pythagorean Tuning 3:2 for the Vth; but 81:64 for the major third.</p><p>There are also hybrids of the other three, Eg.<br/>&lt;outbind://11/tuning/mean_tone.html&gt; Meantone Temperaments.&quot;</p><p>I have to say that your are the first author known to me that finds that ALL<br/>the possible musical subdivisions of the octave (or &quot;temperaments&quot;) are<br/>hybrids of your basic three groups.</p><p>I  fail to see how that could be the case of some specific systems belonging<br/>to the well-known group of Circular temperaments, e.g. those using a few<br/>sharp fifths, such as d&apos;Alembert-Rousseau ordinaire and quite a few<br/>Well/Good temperaments by Werckmeister and Neidhardt. Perhaps you could<br/>explain us how they can be hybrids of your 3 basic types?</p><p>C. You then write &quot;If the only point of agreement is that the octave ratio<br/>should be exactly two; how do we explain the phenomenon of stretched<br/>octaves, used by some piano tuners?&quot;</p><p>Since you do not comment further on the matter, the non-specialist may<br/>believe that the answer is unknown or in doubt, but the matter has been the<br/>object of  well-known and extensive research and is clearly understood.

You<br/>do not  say which success it enjoyed in its time (surely if he had his choir<br/>singing to it only proves his leadership or power, not the goodness of his<br/>scale). You do not state either why should that proposal stand out among the<br/>thousands of useless proposals written down in antiquity and in modern<br/>times.  Guess the use of the Pi ratio has some useful acoustical properties,<br/>but your page does not show which or why. Perhaps you could give a brief<br/>explanation  about the benefits of the PI scale compared with well-known<br/>scales such as your &quot;basic 3&quot;?</p><p>E.

Not an academic thesis.</p><p>I did originally write a bibliography for Pitch, Pi, more than twenty years<br/>ago.</p><p>and since the references were generally well-known writings on microtuning<br/>etc. and things change fast, the only references that made it onto the<br/>website were John Harrison writings.<br/>My initial three categories seemed to me to be a reasonable way to think<br/>about microtuning.</p><p>Maybe using the words &quot; Mixture, combination or extension&quot; would have been<br/>more appropriate to hybrid in this context, yet hybrid does serve its<br/>purpose in this context?</p><p>I did not find written (by him) firm evidence Harrison was leaving it for<br/>future generations to find, yet it seems to me to be a reasonable<br/>supposition.</p><p>(must have imagined) Why else would Harrison have worried to write/publish<br/>all these ideas on tuning at the end of his life? - poetic license?</p><p>I have a number of theories on why some people have stretched octaves, but<br/>they don&apos;t seem to be particularly relevant to the subject of John Harrison<br/>and tuning.</p><p>The pi tuning is yet another &quot;hybrid&quot; as it exhibits some characteristics of<br/>more than one of the categories. e.g. close to 88edo.</p><p>(its Fifths are 695.81 Cents each: it is well known that in meantone spirals<br/>a difference of less than 1/2 Cent is not significant).</p><p>WELL KNOWN by whom???</p><p>I totally disagree with this &quot;well known&quot; --- (fact?)<br/>Think about what you are claiming. You get vast differences in cents between<br/>intervals of different cent values after only a few steps of fourths and<br/>fifths, and you are totally ignoring the beating implications.</p><p>Yes, LucyTuning exhibits the patterns and characteristics that one would<br/>expect from a negative meantone tuning, yet before you dismiss it as<br/>&quot;nothing special&quot;  explore a little further, and LISTEN to the harmonies<br/>that it produces, try it out on some of you own compositions, and then<br/>comment from your own experience and experimentations.</p><p>thanks for your thoughts</p><p>On 17 Mar 2009, at 23:23, Claudio Di Veroli wrote:</p><p>Charles Lucy wrote:</p><p>&quot;There is a quick and dirty, easy to use Javascript which I wrote many years<br/>ago to do this conversion in each direction on this page (about half way<br/>down the page)</p><p> <a href="http://www.lucytune">http://www.lucytune</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.lucytune.com/new_to_lt/pitch_01.html">http://www.lucytune.com/new_to_lt/pitch_01.html</a>&gt;<br/>.com/new_to_lt/pitch_01.html&quot;</p><p> Thanks Charles for sharing your writings with us !</p><p>I have a few questions that I am sure will help to understand your writings<br/>better:</p><p>A. You are writing about the basics of musical scales and temperaments. The<br/>matter has been researched ever since the Middle Ages and conspicuously in<br/>modern times, with important publications. It is agreed that a writing like<br/>yours should quote the main sources  (ancient and modern) upon which your<br/>statements are based, yet I cannot find any list of References/Literature in<br/>the webpage you mention in your email. Sorry cannot find it in other we<br/>bgpages of yours, though my search was not exhaustive: could you tell us<br/>where  they are? Thanks!</p><p>B. You write in that webpage:</p><p>&quot;this octave was subdivided in three basic ways;</p><p>1) By a geometric progression, with any number of equal <a href="http://intervals.Eg">intervals.Eg</a>. 12 (as<br/>on conventional guitars) [100 cents per semitone or interval]; 31 as<br/>advocated by Huyghens (1629-1695) [38.71 cents per interval], or 53 by<br/>Mercator and Bosanquet (1876 Treatise) [22.64 cents];</p><p>2) By  &lt;outbind://11/tuning/just_intonation.html&gt; low whole number ratios.<br/>Eg. (Just Intonation) 3:2 for the Vth; 5:4 for the major third etc.</p><p>3) By cumulative fifths. Eg.  &lt;outbind://11/tuning/pythagorean.html&gt;<br/>Pythagorean Tuning 3:2 for the Vth; but 81:64 for the major third.</p><p>There are also hybrids of the other three, Eg.<br/>&lt;outbind://11/tuning/mean_tone.html&gt; Meantone Temperaments.&quot;</p><p>I have to say that your are the first author known to me that finds that ALL<br/>the possible musical subdivisions of the octave (or &quot;temperaments&quot;) are<br/>hybrids of your basic three groups.</p><p>I  fail to see how that could be the case of some specific systems belonging<br/>to the well-known group of Circular temperaments, e.g. those using a few<br/>sharp fifths, such as d&apos;Alembert-Rousseau ordinaire and quite a few<br/>Well/Good temperaments by Werckmeister and Neidhardt. Perhaps you could<br/>explain us how they can be hybrids of your 3 basic types?</p><p>C. You then write &quot;If the only point of agreement is that the octave ratio<br/>should be exactly two; how do we explain the phenomenon of stretched<br/>octaves, used by some piano tuners?&quot;</p><p>Since you do not comment further on the matter, the non-specialist may<br/>believe that the answer is unknown or in doubt, but the matter has been the<br/>object of  well-known and extensive research and is clearly understood. Is<br/>there any reason why you  wrote that question and left it unanswered in your<br/>webpage?</p><p>D: Later you explain the Pi scale, originating in Harrison&apos;s writings. You<br/>do not  say which success it enjoyed in its time (surely if he had his choir<br/>singing to it only proves his leadership or power, not the goodness of his<br/>scale). You do not state either why should that proposal stand out among the<br/>thousands of useless proposals written down in antiquity and in modern<br/>times.  Guess the use of the Pi ratio has some useful acoustical properties,<br/>but your page does not show which or why. Perhaps you could give a brief<br/>explanation  about the benefits of the PI scale compared with well-known<br/>scales such as your &quot;basic 3&quot;?</p><p>E. You write</p><p>&quot;Harrison must have imagined this moment when he wrote his book for some<br/>future generation to decipher.&quot;</p><p>Did Harrison write that  he had the above intentions?</p><p>If he did, please quote the sentence.</p><p>If he did not, you are surely aware that quite a few modern writers have<br/>assumed that the ancient - typically Bach - have left tuning clues written<br/>as &quot;hieroglyphics to be deciphered&quot;: Kelletat, Kellner, Lehman and many more<br/>. Scholars have put forward strong arguments against all those writings.<br/>What makes you believe that yours is different?</p><p>F. You write</p><p>&quot;As hundreds of people are now using these discoveries,&quot;</p><p>I guess I am myself , like many readers, unaware of Pi tuning and related<br/>matters, because I fail to find which significant discoveries are you<br/>referring to. Whether they are by yourself or by Harrison, it would be<br/>useful to know which are they, which issues they resolve that were not<br/>resolved by already-known scales, and if so, how they do it.</p><p>G. I also gave a look at the following webpage of yours, where you describe<br/>your &quot;Lucy Tuning&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune">http://www.lucytune</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.lucytune.com/new_to_lt/pitch_02.html">http://www.lucytune.com/new_to_lt/pitch_02.html</a>&gt;<br/>.com/new_to_lt/pitch_02.html</p><p>You describe there a tuning based on the well-known Medieval-Renaissance<br/>principle of the &quot;Spiral of Fifths&quot;.</p><p>The peculiarity of Lucy Tuning is using fifths sized 695.49 Cents each.</p><p>Isn&apos;t this identical, to all practical purposes, to the spiral of Fifths of<br/>the well-known 2/7 Syntonic comma tuning described by Zarlino in the 16th<br/>century?</p><p>(its Fifths are 695.81 Cents each: it is well known that in meantone spirals<br/>a difference of less than 1/2 Cent is not significant).</p><p>Which is the advantage of Lucy tuning over Zarlino&apos;s 2/7 S.c. temperament?</p><p>I am sure your explanations will help us to understand your writings better.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Claudio</p><p>Charles Lucy<br/>lucy@lucytune. &lt;mailto:lucy@...&gt; com</p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune">http://www.lucytune</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a>&gt; .com</p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabie">http://www.lullabie</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a>&gt; <a href="http://s.co.uk">s.co.uk</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2009 8:17:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If your interest is limited to 11-limit ratios, i have<br/>computed the cents values for a very large subset of<br/>the theoretically-infinite 11-limit lattice, on this webpage:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/i/interval-list.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/i/interval-list.aspx</a></p><p>Most of this list has a rather messy format ... i was<br/>formatting it by hand and got as far as 150 cents, and<br/>also included the &quot;tina&quot; calculation (my preferred EDO<br/>unit of measurement) for each ratio up to that point.</p><p>I plan to eventually write a python script to finish<br/>the formatting ... but can&apos;t say when ...</p><p>-monz</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John H.
