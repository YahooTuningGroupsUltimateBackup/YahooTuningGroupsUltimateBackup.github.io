Has a lot of energy<br/>&gt;in it - wakes one up!</p><p>    12 ET may wake one up, at first, but there is an inuring effect that<br/>comes with it.  Ultimately, it begins to dull the senses at a particularly<br/>organic level.  Et can desensitize the nervous system in a sadly insidious<br/>way.<br/>    When all like intervals are the same tempered size, the ear begins to<br/>accept the dissonance as the standard harmonic quality, and stops listening<br/>for the textural sensations that comes from juxtaposing tempered vs. Just<br/>intervals.  (We may liken this to weather.  After a few weeks of perfect 70<br/>degree, sunny weather in the South Pacific islands, I began to wish for the<br/>excitement of a passing thunderstorm.  Unchanging qualities dull our senses<br/>in one way or another).<br/>   So it is with 12 ET.  All thirds are the same and they are all busy, but<br/>after a while, that busy-ness becomes less and less stimulative.  We just<br/>stop paying attention to the physical quality of the interval. Compare this<br/>to a Kirnberger III and we find that the busy-ness of the A or Eb triad is<br/>much more noticeable after the near purity of the C, G or F.  Indeed, the<br/>appreciation for either direction is enhanced by there being a contrast with<br/>the other.</p><p>&gt;(Though it may possibly be somewhat of a twentieth century aquired taste,<br/>&gt;otherwise why didn&apos;t the musicians of Bach&apos;s time go for it when they could<br/>have easily retuned<br/>&gt;their harpsichords to match their lutes etc.).</p><p>    (Half full/ half empty glasses sitting on the brow of my nose)  I posit<br/>that ET isn&apos;t an acquired taste so much as it is an entropic result of<br/>convenience ( entrophy in the sense of the degradation of the matter and<br/>energy in the universe to an ultimate state of inert uniformity).  Great<br/>music can be built with it, but it has its costs.<br/>     It is very difficult to get an ET by unison matching a keyboard to a<br/>lute, but I don&apos;t think that is the reason for its rejection in the 18th<br/>century.  The well-tempered tunings are more complex than ET, and they<br/>provide a greater degree of expression than those that were homogenious,(such<br/>as the 1/4C or ET).  The piano music of the Classical era made use of the<br/>greater resources available when the keys had their own characters and the<br/>loss of those characters is, imho, one reason that that music has fallen as<br/>far from favor as it has.<br/>   So,  I submit that the greatest shortcoming of ET is not that the keys are<br/>lacking in consonance, but rather, that there is only one harmonic value for<br/>any given class of intervals, the result of which is that in the listener,<br/>the involuntary psycho-physiological-emotive processes are reduced, and that<br/>much of the music&apos;s effect becomes based on intellectual response, rather<br/>than the emotional/intellectual reaction that can make music such a magical<br/>event.<br/>   I dunno,  using ET to construct music is like using bricks to construct<br/>buildings.  They can create some major structures, but a brick building will<br/>never create the same impression as one built of natural stone.<br/>Playing Bach on ET is similar to building a replica of Notre Dame Cathedral<br/>out of brick. Something is lost in the process, but only those that have seen<br/>the original may notice what is missing.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/24/2002 6:59:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Nice image below, Ed.

Whether that also makes it a poor scale, I&apos;m not<br/>sure. I think it is a fine one if one takes it in its own terms - but if you compare<br/>it with historical temperaemnts, of course you won&apos;t find the variety you like in those,<br/>and ditto, if you compare it with just intonation you won&apos;t find the pure j.i. intervals<br/>either... I just think those who like 12-et are to be respected, and many like it<br/>and don&apos;t like j.i. - well whether you call it habit or aquired taste, it&apos;s the same<br/>thing really. I like 12-et on many occasions, but maybe not so much if I hear it immediately after<br/>some other tuning with pure j.i. intervals. But, I don&apos;t hear these things very analytically<br/>anyway. Maybe that applies to others too...</p><p>&gt; While percussion instruments have a different partial series than other instruments,<br/>&gt; the partials are still in harmony with each other within just temperament limitations.<br/>&gt; For example in the regular harmonic partials the 11th harmonid at 551 cents, while it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t form part of a harmonious chord, is nonetheless beat free when played with a chord.<br/>&gt;  The 13th at 841 cents is the same.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s an interesting point. So the fifth and seventh harmonics are the ones<br/>that will beat.</p><p>However, the eleventh and thirteenth harmonics can also seem &quot;out of tune&quot; to a musician<br/>thoroughly trained to 12-et too I gather. At times I can hear them that way too,<br/>especially if I have been listening to a lot of 12-et music.</p><p>The thought was that if one listened carefully to the timbre of a string<br/>instrument one would hear that all these notes actually get played anyway,<br/>all of them, as the hidden partials within the timbre, so how can one<br/>really say that they are &quot;out of tune&quot; in 12-et?</p><p>Once one has made that step, I think one is perhaps on ones way to understanding<br/>the point of just intonation - well one possible way in anyway.</p><p>I have found out that I can easily make a clip of a &apos;cello voice<br/>using FFT synthesis in FTS, then fade one of the partials in and out.</p><p>So, here it is:<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#Newbie_notes">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#Newbie_notes</a></p><p>I know it doesn&apos;t sound that much like a &apos;cello after you take<br/>the partials apart and put them together like that, but<br/>perhaps it gives an idea.</p><p>My hope of course is that it might help 12-et habituated newbie<br/>microtonalist listeners to hear the 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics<br/>as in tune :-), or potentially so anyway, or at least understand<br/>why some might find them so - rather than to learn to<br/>hear &apos;cello concertos etc. as populated with<br/>annoying out of tune notes :-(.</p><p>But you have to listen quite hard to hear them anyway so don&apos;t suppose that<br/>would happen.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/24/2002 8:25:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/24/02 9:05:07 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:robertwalker@ntlworld.com">robertwalker@ntlworld.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; So the fifth and seventh harmonics are the ones<br/>&gt; that will beat.<br/>&gt;<br/>My point was, when the just 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th harmonics<br/>are played together as a chord, they are beat free with each other.
