Partials 12,<br/>13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 21 give me the following :-</p><p>1/1, 13/12, 7/6, 17/12, 3/2, 19/12, 7/4.</p><p>Another on partials 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 produce :-</p><p>1/1, 11/10, 6/5, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 9/5.</p><p>Apart from correcting any errors here I&apos;d be interested to hear from<br/>anyone who knows which tone is the starting tone for each of these<br/>pelogs.</p><p>I was delighted with the &quot;Kyai Udan Anim&quot; using partials 30, 32, 35, 40,<br/>44, 47, 54 to give : -</p><p>1/1, 16/15, 7/6, 4/3, 22/15, 47/30, 17/10. A quick listen to this<br/>revealed two usable minor triads on i and ii, (that&apos;s if I have the<br/>right starting tone).</p><p>And finally, &quot;Nature&apos;s Own&quot; (presumably referring to the minor third<br/>with 19, though I don&apos;t know the origins of the term) slendro with<br/>partials 12, 14, 16, 19 and 27. I think I tried : -</p><p>1/1, 9/8, 7/6, 4/3, 19/12</p><p>and could only find the &quot;Nature&apos;s Own&quot; minor third on 4/3, 19/12, 2/1<br/>(16,19, 24), ie overlapping into the second 2/1 so I obviously have the<br/>wrong starting tone here. Any help appreciated and if I&apos;m talking total<br/>nonsense don&apos;t hesitate.... etc.</p><p>Kind regards</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2002 1:20:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Folks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks to those who advised me on partials and the like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m looking at some of Lou Harrison&apos;s pelogs and slendros.<br/>Partials 12,<br/>&gt; 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 21 give me the following :-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1, 13/12, 7/6, 17/12, 3/2, 19/12, 7/4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another on partials 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 produce :-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1, 11/10, 6/5, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 9/5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apart from correcting any errors here I&apos;d be interested to hear<br/>from<br/>&gt; anyone who knows which tone is the starting tone for each of<br/>these<br/>&gt; pelogs.</p><p>pelog scales are 5-tone scales taken from a selection of 7<br/>pitches. various pitches from the set of 7 can and do serve as<br/>the tonic. you should do some reading on indonesian music<br/>theory -- some links have been posted recently, i think the<br/>anaphoria website contains a fine example.</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 10:17:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>paulerlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks to those who advised me on partials and the like.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m looking at some of Lou Harrison&apos;s pelogs and slendros.<br/>&gt; Partials 12,<br/>&gt; &gt; 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 21 give me the following :-<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1, 13/12, 7/6, 17/12, 3/2, 19/12, 7/4.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another on partials 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 produce :-<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1, 11/10, 6/5, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 9/5.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Apart from correcting any errors here I&apos;d be interested to hear<br/>&gt; from<br/>&gt; &gt; anyone who knows which tone is the starting tone for each of<br/>&gt; these<br/>&gt; &gt; pelogs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; pelog scales are 5-tone scales taken from a selection of 7<br/>&gt; pitches. various pitches from the set of 7 can and do serve as<br/>&gt; the tonic. you should do some reading on indonesian music<br/>&gt; theory -- some links have been posted recently, i think the<br/>&gt; anaphoria website contains a fine example.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That much I know, but I&apos;m still unsure as to the starting tone which is important if you&apos;re making<br/>an instrument.
