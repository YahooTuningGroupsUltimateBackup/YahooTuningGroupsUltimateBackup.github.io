If Harry<br/>was pictured in front of an Arp setup, I&apos;d be my bottom dollar it was the<br/>one installed in the Electronic Music Lab at San Diego State, where he<br/>would occasionally go to listen to a tape, courtesy of David Dunn.

He had received a<br/>visit from Herman Pedtke, inventor of the Scalatron, an electronic<br/>keyboard designed to accommodate microtonal tunings -- the very<br/>instrument he had dreamed of as long ago as 1945 in Madison. Partch was<br/>fascinated by the instrument, but noted to a friend that his work had<br/>gone  in a very different direction in the years since, and now involved<br/>&quot;far more than a microtonal scale.&quot; To another friend he added mournfully<br/>that the Scalatron was &quot;just what I needed. Thirty years too late.&quot;&apos;</p><p>Gilmore - &quot;Harry Partch: a Biography&quot; (p. 385)</p><p>&lt;/paraindent&gt;</p><p>This sheds light on an important distinction: it is not that Partch was<br/>neither interested in nor aware of electronic instruments, in development<br/>at the time, that could have aided in his composition -- he was. The<br/>point is that by this late date Partch&apos;s compositions had grown to<br/>encompass far more than the accurate reproduction of pitch material, and<br/>the actual means of performing the &apos;music&apos; -- the instruments themselves,<br/>with all of their flaws, inconsistencies, anomalies and performing<br/>gesticulations -- had become as much a part of the work as the<br/>intonation.</p><p>Important to keep in mind, I hazard. Frequently (by virtue of human<br/>nature), people pick the one or two quotes from Harriana that seem to<br/>support the performance of Partch&apos;s work by other instrumental resources,<br/>all the while ignoring the great body of evidence to the contrary. But<br/>more on this later...  :)</p><p>2. HTML list, as proposed by Gary Morrison:</p><p>&gt;   Well, HTML provides a means of embedding attachments of various<br/>sorts,</p><p>&gt;including graphics and sound into a message, and tagging them to<br/>specific</p><p>&gt;places in the text.  That&apos;s a big improvement over to just a<br/>nondescript</p><p>&gt;series of attachments.  And it&apos;s not so much extended ASCII (it looks<br/>like</p><p>&gt;that&apos;s already available for most of us) as much as formatted text -</p><p>&gt;headers, indentation, italicization, lists, colors, etc.</p><p>Gary, having spent a good deal of time hand-coding html over the last few<br/>years, including a *lot* of graphic and audio investigation, I think you<br/>might be over estimating the ease of such a list. While an audio event<br/>*can* be embedded in html, it is the browser that interprets that<br/>embedding and calls the correct plug-in module to play the audio (be it<br/>midi, a sound file [of the *many* different formats] or a streaming audio<br/>file) -- I have serious doubts, though I have never tried it, as to how<br/>an email program (such as Eudora 4.0) would handle audio events. And,<br/>yes, it is possible that graphics might actually show up in the body of<br/>the text, but I fail to see how this is preferred over posting a web page<br/>somewhere; this could be mentioned as a link in a message to this list,<br/>which most modern email programs would launch the browser appropriately<br/>when clicked on, and then everyone would have the opportunity to either<br/>go there or not, depending on their computer resources, how much they pay<br/>to be online, etc.</p><p>(Let&apos;s not forget that this list is fairly international, and as Dan Wolf<br/>points out, some places pay dearly for time online...)</p><p>Another factor regarding the attachments, be they literal &apos;attachments&apos;<br/>or items &apos;embedded&apos; in the html source: the recently past holidays<br/>brought up the problem of many newbies attaching cute &quot;Holiday Greetings&quot;<br/>widgets to emails to their friends (I know, as my wife received a 2 meg<br/>animated Christmas tree). Many ISP&apos;s reported a big drain on resources as<br/>these files, which must reside *somewhere* until the mail is retrieved,<br/>sat hogging space on servers all over.</p><p>All of that as opposed to *one* version of the graphic, sound file,<br/>whatever, sitting on a web page somewhere that all the various members<br/>here could go visit and download at their leisure. Just a thought, albeit<br/>a lengthy one. And, after all that is said, I heartily endorse the use of<br/>*real* music clips, instead of *talk* about music.
