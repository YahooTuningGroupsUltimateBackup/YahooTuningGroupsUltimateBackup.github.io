That&apos;s only 2500 years ago. He was<br/>obviously the younger contemporary of Pythagoras (c. 580-500 BCE).</p><p>Furthermore, according to my understanding, his teachings contradict that of<br/>Daoism to a large extent since the doctrine of Lao Zi stresses harmony with<br/>nature rather than an unquestioning adherence to royal Chinese morals. I<br/>have read not a long time ago the conflict between Confucius and a famous<br/>Daoist philosopher on the very issue of morality.</p><p>As to the matter of music and notation, pentatonic counterpoint should at<br/>least have some written theory behind it from that or a later era, no?</p><p>The assertion about pure harmony leading to a nationalist/fascist school of<br/>music intrigues me. Were it that this was nothing but humor! As a matter of<br/>fact, harmonization of Folk Music melodies was a state-sponsored agenda<br/>during the foundation of the young Turkish Republic to the detriment of<br/>Maqam Music theory and education.</p><p>While I am in full agreement that a particular genre of music should never<br/>claim superiority over any other in the globe, I nevertheless think that the<br/>tools of composition aka counterpoint, polyphony, canon, fugue, etc... are<br/>signs as to how much advanced a musical culture is in its stages of<br/>development.</p><p>I agree with Lou Harrison! The Classical Philarmonic Orchestra does not<br/>provide all the tone colors one could ask for. Yet, although Western<br/>Classical school of music (which may be thought to comprise the Jazz<br/>tradition) does not and cannot represent the peak of musical evolution<br/>(as many conditioned people in Turkey might tend to think), it still is<br/>doing great with the tools at its disposal.</p><p>Why, the Western Classical tradition possesses a superior methodology by<br/>which it educates virtuosos in legions. Maqam Music culture would do well to<br/>benefit from these tools and methods for music production instead of<br/>shunning them on basis of cultural discrimination.</p><p>Of course, this should be realized without any harm to its<br/>historical/traditional context!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gbreed@gmail.com">gbreed@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 19 Eyl&iuml;&iquest;&half;l 2005 Pazartesi 16:05<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Confucius</p><p>&gt; Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Uh, I did not know that counterpoint - without serious expertise in<br/>&gt; &gt; polyphonic notation - was possible to execute!

At<br/>&gt; what point is it called a harmony?</p><p>Ah, well, things are indeed a little more complicated than they look<br/>at first sight! The word &quot;harmony&quot; as such has a rather broad meaning<br/>- the examples you give above can all fall into that - so, in this<br/>sense, &quot;harmony&quot; is present in nearly all music...</p><p>But to elaborate a little more on Ansermet&apos;s idea - drones are a good<br/>keyword. Imagine a melody played over a drone - and then the same<br/>melody played over a different drone. The perceptions will be quite<br/>different, since the effect of a drone is to emphasize a kind of base<br/>or reference tone - it is often the tone the melody starts or stops<br/>on, so the melody will be heard relative to that base tone.<br/>A single drone, however, is rather a non-moving space, so music with<br/>just one drone would still be called, so to say, &quot;pre-copernican&quot;.<br/>But imagine a piece where the drone changes in the middle - then the<br/>reference tone changes: moving ground! Maybe the word &quot;modulation&quot; is<br/>a good keyword that describes what I mean.<br/>Which brings me to another point. On the website about maqam music you<br/>posted here a whlie ago, I read that in maqam music there are<br/>modulations, too - just not &quot;harmony&quot;, but, as far as I understand it,<br/>between different kinds of melody. So far for the question about maqam<br/>music and &quot;Dark Ages&quot;!<br/>I am sorry I do not know much about maqams (nor did Ansermet, I<br/>suppose) - but I am just imagining that the concept of modulation may<br/>not always have been present in maqam music and entered at a certain<br/>period of time - maybe Ozan can tell something here?<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div><h3><a id=60779 href="#60779">ðŸ”—</a>Justin . &#x3C;justinasia@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2005 8:36:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- hstraub64 &lt;<a href="mailto:hstraub64@telesonique.net">hstraub64@telesonique.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But imagine a piece where the drone changes in the<br/>&gt; middle - then the<br/>&gt; reference tone changes: moving ground!</p><p>What about a solo instrument then, playing a melody<br/>which includes a change in key?

Any random tuning will do, but if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; obsessed, as I am, with Western polyphonic goodness, a good<br/>&gt; &gt; linear temperament, as we&apos;ve defined them on the tuning-math<br/>&gt; &gt; list, is indispensable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the sciences, theory may predict reality.<br/>&gt; In the arts, theory more often than not fails to predict reality.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to know what this means, but it reminds me of the<br/>Spock vs. McCoy thing on Star Trek, which even as a kid I<br/>thought was nonsense.  The success of existing theories (or<br/>the ones you happen to choose to test) says nothing about the<br/>utility of theory-building.  In fact, it seems likely that<br/>the arts and sciences and everything else can be generated in<br/>a finite amount of time by simply testing all possible computer<br/>programs in order with a proof-checker.  Clearly, emotions (in<br/>general) have adaptive value for humans -- they are useful --<br/>so they must have internal logic.

The first consciously measured pitches, I guess, occured when players of string instruments discovered the 3:2 relationship and used it consistently. Meantone occured when the harmonic English third entered Continental polyphonie, and people eventually demonstrated fractions of the comma on the monochord. I am kind of waiting for the general acceptance of a system that integrates the 7:4. But in the age of electronic tuners it is just as possible to compose in and communicate a tuning by its cent values note for totally random note.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=60980 href="#60980">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2005 1:18:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Justin .&quot; &lt;justinasia@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I have started my analysis of pitch in shakuhachi<br/>&gt; recoerdings of the honkyoku repetoire (that played by<br/>&gt; wandering buddhist monks).

They are called meri<br/>notes, and as I have just said they are dark. They are<br/>creted by finger shading and lowering your head. Even<br/>if you want to get the western pitch you have to use<br/>those techniques to get it. And then, in this music<br/>you bend it a lot, especially lower. What I have done<br/>is basically taken the HIGHEST values for the notes,<br/>and then averaged them. For example, we make play<br/>tsu-meri, which I have said is Eb-25, but we may<br/>actually start it at the pitch of D! It is still<br/>written tsu-meri (whereas the note which is properly D<br/>is called ro). And so we might start at D, and then<br/>play around between D and Eb-25, cruising around in<br/>between, or alternating from one extreme to the other.<br/>Sometimes we just hang around for a bit in the middle<br/>of them. (Actually technically tsu-meri at D would be<br/>called tsu-dai-meri, dai meaning big or great). But my<br/>point is that even if we play such a variety, it is<br/>based around a particular scale of particular pitch<br/>values. It seems not all western shakuhachi players<br/>appreciate that those values are not the same as 12ET.<br/>Another point is that the pitches may be different in<br/>different lineages. I&apos;m not sure how much of a factor<br/>that is exactly, but certainly I know that some of the<br/>anciant honkyoku pieces are working on a different set<br/>of pitches.<br/>I hope this makes it a bit clearer. I also want to<br/>know what pitches koto players are using as that will<br/>be very informative in an extra way to me. If anyone<br/>knows of studies done please let me know.<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

Humans succeeded in hunting<br/>&gt; all of the large land animals on three continents to<br/>&gt; extinction 60,000 years before you seem to be<br/>&gt; claiming<br/>&gt; the nihilistic view arose.</p><p>I would suggest that that was not due to any<br/>nihilistic view, but parhaps due the foolishness and<br/>imaturity inherent in ethnoi in their early stages of<br/>development (Ethnoi being the plural of ethnos,<br/>basically meaning ethnic group. See a fantastic book<br/>on the subject by Lev Gumilev, available in English<br/>under the title &quot;Ethnogenesis and the Bioshpere&quot;).<br/>When ethnoi mature they develop very fine tuned<br/>balance with their surroundings, such as the various<br/>aboriginal peoples of the world had done before we<br/>wiped most of them out.<br/>I think the main trouble seemed to come with the<br/>advent of agriculture. And that brings a huge<br/>philosophical shift. Hunter gatherers are in an<br/>animate world in which they are not seperate from<br/>nature. Agriculturalists automatically generate a<br/>division between themselves and nature, and that<br/>starts off a division in their mind (or amplifies it).<br/>This is the whole &quot;human&quot; as opposed to &quot;nature&quot;<br/>thing, which leads on to ideas of a paradise seperate<br/>from &quot;here&quot;, eg going to heaven in another place etc.<br/>The idea of here and our experience being not as real<br/>as a heavenly perfection (eg the realm of form and the<br/>realm of ideas, the Greek idea from which leads a<br/>continuous philosophic lineage to present day<br/>science). This connects with the Christian church<br/>believing that the next life is more important than<br/>this one. And with their idea that the world with all<br/>it&apos;s abundant resourses was created by God for us. It<br/>also leads to the idea that our experience is somehow<br/>not valid (we are in the realm of form) in the same<br/>way as the truth which produces it (realm of ideas)<br/>and so qualities become secondary, measurable<br/>quantities primary. With measurements we can then<br/>derive formulae and MATHEMATICS, which is a far<br/>&quot;truer&quot; reality (realm of ideas).<br/>An effect of this is a removal from emotions. This<br/>mindset also implies no ethics. Science is science,<br/>not ethics.<br/>The destruction we are carrying out today is clearly<br/>on a radically different scale to ever before. I think<br/>that can only be carried out when we are disconnected<br/>from nature in this way.</p><p>&gt; Meanwhile, it may be<br/>&gt; surprising that I&apos;m a tribalist of sorts, who<br/>&gt; believes<br/>&gt; odd things like that toilets and routine infant<br/>&gt; circumcision are the greatest evils in the world</p><p>What&apos;s wrong with toilets? You don&apos;t want to shit all<br/>over the place like they do in India do you? That<br/>really does cause a lot of sickness! Or is it flush<br/>toilets that you disapprove of. i could understand<br/>that. Compost toilets are good. Or you can even make<br/>gas for cooking/heating from some toilets!

People don&apos;t remember this because they<br/>thought his science was total nonsence. One place now<br/>taking his science seriously is the Schumacher College<br/>in Dartington, Devon (UK). His was a science of<br/>qualities. It is very very good. Maybe try Henri&apos;s<br/>book. Basically his approach was that he wanted to<br/>understand phenomena &quot;from their own side&quot;. Understand<br/>things &quot;as they are&quot;. He thought the scientific<br/>approach of trying to explain things by explaining<br/>what is &quot;behind&quot; them, eg. in terms of formulae, maths<br/>etc was misguided and perhaps going further from the<br/>truth of the phenomena. Something like that.</p><p>  I disagree with most<br/>&gt; critiques of science I&apos;ve seen, by Nietzsche and<br/>&gt; others.</p><p>I&apos;ve never read them. I get the impression they might<br/>have many many words, which usually puts me off.</p><p>&gt; As for the &quot;determininist scientists&quot;, how many do<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; know?</p><p>I&apos;ve met quite a few. Actually the sciences were alway<br/>smy favourite subjects at school, and i continue to<br/>like science, though my emphasis has shifted since<br/>school as I have been exposed to different methods and<br/>views. And isn&apos;t mainstream science deterministic?<br/>Linear causation and all that?</p><p>&gt; I count among my closest friends and both of<br/>&gt; my<br/>&gt; parents at least a dozen professional scientests<br/>&gt; (and<br/>&gt; many more I&apos;ve partied with).

I can&apos;t say<br/>for sure, but I thin here in the UK most scientists<br/>are atheist. I wonder how they could hold belief in<br/>the Christian doctrines (if they&apos;re Christian) at the<br/>same time as their scientific views.<br/>Anyway, if any of this has much to do with tuning,<br/>perhaps it would be, that to approach tuning from<br/>either a quantitative, or a qualitative perspective,<br/>would probably have very different effects on things.<br/>Then I am assuming that as an art, qualities will<br/>anyway take prescidence.<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

It is not necessary to preserve these traditions by non-Japanese people. There is no obligation to do so, but if it is not done, what a lost opportunity for one&apos;s self and those who hear! It is lost if shakuhachi is studied as another thing to do or play, another thing to show off (ego trip), instead of as &quot;Chikudo&quot; (The Bamboo Way) where it can become a great aid to satisfactory life from a deep innerness of being.</p><p>* This happened at the time of the Meiji Restoration roughly 150 years ago when the shakuhachi began to be cut in the middle for the first time in order to play with other instruments. Before then, it was enough for it to be tuned to itself. By governmental decree in Japan (1868) the shakuhachi and traditional Honkyoku were to be divorced from any religious practice. At this time, the element of &quot;entertainment&quot; became part of shakuhachi music, such as Minyo (folk music), Shinkyoku (modern, new music), and Sankyoku (referring to music played with three instruments: koto, shamisen [sangen], and shakuhachi).<br/><a href="http://www.shakuhachi.org/HONKYOKU.html">http://www.shakuhachi.org/HONKYOKU.html</a></p><p><a href="mailto:chiptruth@excite.com">chiptruth@excite.com</a></p><p> --- On Tue 10/04, Justin . &lt; <a href="mailto:justinasia@yahoo.com">justinasia@yahoo.com</a> &gt; wrote:<br/>From: Justin .

Rudolf<br/>&gt; Steiner and the<br/>&gt; Anthroposophists embraced him, which kept the faith<br/>&gt; alive. Apparently,<br/>&gt; there has been a resurgance of interest.</p><p>I am absolutely not an expert about Goethe. But my<br/>general feeling is that his science is about the<br/>scientist somehow really knowing the phenomena. That<br/>is a very experiencial thing. For example, if you read<br/>a file of information about someone, you have<br/>information about them. But if you live with them,<br/>love them, travel with them, go through extremely<br/>tough times, and wonderful times too, there is a good<br/>chance that you might actually feel that you have in<br/>some way come to &quot;know&quot; them. That is, not know<br/>&quot;about&quot; them, but actually know them. It&apos;s like almost<br/>&quot;being&quot; them. Like you know their &quot;being&quot;.<br/>Perhaps I could put it like this - mainstream science<br/>might gather lots of information about what things<br/>&quot;do&quot;, and his method may be more about how things<br/>&quot;be&quot;. So it&apos;s hard talk about whether science like<br/>that makes big &quot;discoveries&quot;. I guess if you discover<br/>&quot;doings&quot;, then you can public the accumulated<br/>&quot;information&quot;. When you discover &quot;beings&quot; (or<br/>&quot;beingness&quot;) then I think it is an internal experience<br/>(which may well be very profound and is perhaps a<br/>&quot;felt&quot; thing), so you don&apos;t exactly have information<br/>to publish, but you have experience to carry. Well,<br/>actually I think it changes you. As an example, a<br/>physicist may discover with his instruments that<br/>subatomic particles arise and dissapear, and thus<br/>deduce that everthing is impermanent in some way. This<br/>in itself might not have a profound effect on him.<br/>Maybe the then just has that information. But ,for<br/>example, a buddhist meditator make directly experience<br/>with his/her mind that everything arises and passes<br/>away, and experience directly in a very concrete way<br/>that everything is impermanent, and that may utterly<br/>change her life and her way of experiencing the world<br/>for ever.<br/>The methods are interesting, and the results very<br/>interesting. i would love to see more of that style<br/>about.<br/>Best wishes<br/>Justin.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!

For example, most composers who use<br/>&gt;the octatonic (diminished) scale in 12-equal still consider the<br/>&gt;identity interval to be the octave, even though the period of<br/>&gt;the scale is 1/4 octave.</p><p>It seems like more a matter of instrument design than anything<br/>else.  For instance, do I tune my piano in an octave-equivalent<br/>tuning or a 700cents-equivalent one?  I suppose the best answer<br/>is: in the center octaves I tune the latter and at either end<br/>I tune the former.  Kurt Bigler took the radical step of using<br/>different pitch classes at octave-equivalent keys on his<br/>harpsichord, and it&apos;s worked reasonably well for him.  The most<br/>fruitful way to catalog popular scales in 12-equal is probably<br/>with a list of tetrachords rather than a list of octave-spanning<br/>scales.  I do believe we hear octave equivalence unless a context<br/>is carefully constructed to avoid it.  But it isn&apos;t clear how<br/>this could be determined by looking at instruments or music.  If<br/>I write a piece in the diminished scale, themes will probably be<br/>repeated (and played together) at the octave and at the minor<br/>third.  Since temperamets must approximate octaves well to be<br/>rated well under any of the schemes proposed on tuning-math (and<br/>weighting schemes favor 2s over all other identities), I can see<br/>no need of intervals of equivalence in a theory of scales.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=61112 href="#61112">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 3:10:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; wallyesterpaulrus wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@o...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;   The first consciously measured pitches, I guess, occured<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;players of string instruments discovered the 3:2 relationship and<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; used<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;it consistently.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; According to Chinese lore, it was wind instruments (pipes), many<br/>&gt; &gt; millenia ago.

Meantone is<br/>linear, but use 5 for the interval of equivalence, and the period<br/>becomes a fourth of that--the meantone fifth.</p></div><h3><a id=61151 href="#61151">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 4:37:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Hi Justin,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m replying on<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/metatuning">/metatuning</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; if you want to follow this further.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Carl<br/>&gt; I couldn&apos;t find your reply there.<br/>&gt; Justin</p><p><a href="/metatuning/topicId_9310.html#9310">/metatuning/topicId_9310.html#9310</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=61155 href="#61155">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 4:47:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought pajara was the name of a linear temperament with a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5-note DE at the half-octave.

I&apos;ve also been playing around with a new tuning purely for the sake of exploration and in the process discovered a new melody that hadn&apos;t occurred to me before. Sometimes this happens at the keyboard, or occasionally while using the Cakewalk piano roll, but it always involves my ears; I don&apos;t often get results that satisfy me by juggling numbers.

The quote from a web page below,<br/>on the other hand, seems to refer to the same person (the same year,<br/>that&apos;s for sure) and says nothing about pipes. What&apos;s more, the<br/>writer, Tran Van Khe, stresses that no division of the octave was<br/>involved, but a principle of averages; this doesn&apos;t necessarily imply<br/>an absolutely equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; So what was set in stone,</p><p>The standard Chinese pitches, and literally:</p><p>from <a href="http://www.vn-style.com/vim/english/information/bai_Dan%20da.htm">http://www.vn-style.com/vim/english/information/bai_Dan%20da.htm</a></p><p>A thousand years B.C ago, China had precious or marble stones in cubic<br/>meter-shape or fish-shape called Qing (Khanh). An instrument with 16<br/>stones of the same size but different thickness is called Bian Qing<br/>(Bien Khanh). The first stone gives the lowest sound called Hoang<br/>Chung sound. The stones give out different sounds of semitone and in<br/>an 12-tone octave. The last 4 stones make the first 4 sounds of a<br/>higher octave. Bien Khanh is not an instrument to produce melody but<br/>to be used as &quot; standard &quot; for tones played in festival music. A sound<br/>of khanh is used to begin a musical sentence or some musical<br/>sentences. A chime sound is used to end a musical sentence or some<br/>musical sentences.</p><p>The 12 tones are called Luat Lu (6 Luat are Yang and 6 Lu are Yin)<br/>with the</p><p>following names :<br/>Ho&agrave;ng chung is pronounced like Fa<br/>&eacute;?i l? Fa#<br/>Tha;&#xF;i th?c Sol<br/>Gia;&#xF;p chung Sol #<br/>Ca;% t?y La<br/>Tr?ng l? La#<br/>Nhuy t&otilde;n Si<br/>L&otilde;m chung Do<br/>Di t?c Do#<br/>Nam l? Ra;&#x19;<br/>Va;% x? Ra;&#x19;#<br/>?ng chung Mi</p><p>However, in the documents of China about Luat Lu, music researchers<br/>found out that since Minh dynasty, when mentioning about 12 Luat Lu<br/>(circa 1595), Chau Tai Duc talked about average principle. He pointed<br/>out that average princile did not create a scale by dividing an octave<br/>into 12 equal semitone but focused on 12 Luat Lu regulated in Hoang<br/>chung based on the rule &quot;Tam phan ton ich&quot;. These 12 Luat Lu were<br/>arranged from low to high to create a dodecaphonic in an octave.<br/>However, as we mentioned above, they are &quot;standard&quot; tones and Chinese<br/>people never use them. For example when performing Nhac chuong in the<br/>sacrifice ceremony for Duc Khong Tu, Cung must have the pitch as high<br/>as Giap chung in the spring and Nam lu in the fall.</p></div><h3><a id=61223 href="#61223">ðŸ”—</a>Justin . &#x3C;justinasia@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2005 2:20:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all<br/>I will soon have less time and so I will no longer<br/>receive the mails from this group.
