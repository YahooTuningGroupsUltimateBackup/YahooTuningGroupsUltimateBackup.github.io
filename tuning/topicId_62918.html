I doubt you will find references to these type of<br/>&gt; things in the historical performance practice. Like always,<br/>&gt; musicians used their ears in performance to correct wandering<br/>&gt; pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beethoven&apos;s contemporaries (Hummel for one) were advocating<br/>&gt; quasi-equal tunings just after Beethoven&apos;s death. In the<br/>&gt; absence of contrary evidence, like the type of diesis shift<br/>&gt; you claim would have happened in practice, there is no reason<br/>&gt; to suppose that by middle-Beethoven, the trend in tuning was<br/>&gt; towards well-temperaments that approach quasi-equal, so I<br/>&gt; think I&apos;m with Paul here....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OTOH, I think what you&apos;re doing is great with these experiments<br/>&gt; with the standard rep, and we can learn alot about these<br/>&gt; issues and make some very educated guesses, so keep up the<br/>&gt; good work.</p><p>Thanks for the vote of confidence and encouragement.</p><p>Leopold Mozart&apos;s popular violin method of 1756 does<br/>have exercises demonstrating how to make the flats a<br/>comma higher than their &quot;enharmonically equivalent&quot; sharps.</p><p>If Beethoven tied, say, a D# in a B-major chord to a<br/>D# in what otherwise looks like a C-minor chord, in a<br/>string quartet or other piece not involving a keyboard,<br/>then i would say that he intended both D#&apos;s to be the<br/>same pitch. But if he tied the D# to an Eb in the C-minor<br/>chord -- which is exactly the kind of thing i&apos;ve seen in<br/>his scores -- then i would say that he intended a diesis<br/>shift.</p><p>Of course with Beethoven we&apos;re treading on very thin ice<br/>anyway, because for the last 15 years of his life, when<br/>he wrote a lot of his greatest works, he was totally deaf.<br/>So this was all in his mind only, with no possibility to<br/>aurally check the results.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2005 2:19:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Clark,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;threesixesinarow&quot; &lt;CACCOLA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In a case involving enharmonically-equivalent notes which<br/>&gt; &gt; are spelled differently, the two notes would be a diesis apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;[T]he improvements of Sebastien Erard have made [the pedal<br/>&gt; harp] capable of performing any music written for the<br/>&gt; pianoforte.

The closest you can get<br/>&gt; &gt; to a 3 in terms of otaves is two octaves, or 4, and the same is true<br/>&gt; &gt; of 5. This makes 81/80 a 4 also, and the Pythagorean comma a 32, or<br/>&gt; &gt; five octaves. These are both positive numbers of octaves, but<br/>&gt; &gt; distinct; hence the commas are both preserved and distinguished.</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.14.7/214 - Release Date: 23/12/05</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2005 8:20:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 25 Dec 2005, Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What is the smallest EDO that preserves and<br/>&gt; &gt; _distinguishes_ both the syntonic comma and<br/>&gt; &gt; the pythagorean comma?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1-edo.</p><p>Ha!  :-)</p><p>Alright then, rephrasing and redirecting the question:</p><p>Gene,<br/>What is the smallest nontrivial EDO that preserves<br/>and _distinguishes_ both the syntonic comma and<br/>the pythagorean comma?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.14.7/214 - Release Date: 23/12/05</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2005 8:28:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry for barging in like this, but I can&apos;t help myself...</p><p>Al-Javab:</p><p>2-edo</p><p>ROFLWL<br/>Oz.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:yahya@melbpc.org.au">yahya@melbpc.org.au</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 27 Aral&iuml;&iquest;&half;k 2005 Sal&iuml;&iquest;&half; 18:20<br/>Subject: [tuning] RE: avoid &amp; get rid of any Re: enharmonics of slightly<br/>different pitches by 53 Pyth.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, 25 Dec 2005, Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the smallest EDO that preserves and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; _distinguishes_ both the syntonic comma and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the pythagorean comma?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1-edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ha!  :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alright then, rephrasing and redirecting the question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt; What is the smallest nontrivial EDO that preserves<br/>&gt; and _distinguishes_ both the syntonic comma and<br/>&gt; the pythagorean comma?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2005 9:52:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:yahya@melbpc.org.au">yahya@melbpc.org.au</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 27 Aral&iuml;&iquest;&half;k 2005 Sal&iuml;&iquest;&half; 18:20<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: avoid &amp; get rid of any Re: enharmonics of slightly<br/>different pitches by 53 Pyth.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, 25 Dec 2005, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Because, originally:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; prime 2 = 1200.000 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; prime 3 = 1901.955 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; prime 5 = 2786.314 cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Best 2 in 1-edo is: 1200 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; Best approx. of 3 in 1-edo is: 2400 cents (every two octaves/degrees)<br/>&gt; &gt; Best approx. of 5 in 1-edo is again: 2400 cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 80/81 prime factorized is:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 5*2^4 / 3^4<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 531441/524288 prime factorized is:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3^12 / 2^19<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Syntonic comma in 1-edo is:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 deg + (4* 1 deg) - (4* 2 deg)=<br/>&gt; &gt; 2400+(4* 1200) - (4* 2400)=<br/>&gt; &gt; 7200-9600=every 2400 cents (-2 octaves)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagorean comma in 1-edo is:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (12* 2 deg) - (19* 1 deg)=<br/>&gt; &gt; (12*2400) - (19*1200)=<br/>&gt; &gt; 28800-22800=every 6000 cents (+5 octaves)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, Oz, you&apos;re getting quite good at all this mathematical<br/>&gt; stuff ... !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks to my pedant, Paul Erlich.
