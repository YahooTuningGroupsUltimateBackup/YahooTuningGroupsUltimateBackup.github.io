Just thought<br/>I&apos;d pipe up to mention that Ivor Darreg had a remarkable<br/>ability to translate usual 12 per octave keyboards into<br/>non-12 equal temperament keyboards in which, for example,<br/>the note an octave above the note represented by the C4 key<br/>in a 22 per octave tuning would be the Bb5 key.  To play<br/>music in these tunings and quickly shift from one equal<br/>temperament scale to another requires some mental gymnastics<br/>and Ivor Darreg could do them.</p><p>    Speaking of the desert, the San Diego County Pines fire<br/>has been uncomfortably close to the desert community of<br/>Borrego Springs, where I live.  At times there has been a<br/>fairly strong smell of smoke in the air.  At night, ominous<br/>looking pyrotechnics are visible in the mountains and canyons<br/>only a couple miles to the west.  The desert floor here is<br/>dotted with enough shrubs and bushes, as well as cacti, to<br/>make one feel uneasy about a fire&apos;s ability to sustain itself<br/>here.  Thus far, there has been no damage right here, and the<br/>fire seems to be subsiding somewhat.  In the mountain community<br/>of Ranchita, 12 miles to the west, there has been some fire<br/>damage and some homes have been destroyed, although most homes<br/>have been spared.</p><p>Dave Hill, Borrego Springs, CA</p><p>P.S.  I&apos;m thinking of coming out with a revised improved version<br/>of my 1984 Sounds of Just Intonation, which has been sold through<br/>the Just Intonation Network.

The USGS map<br/>has a different name for it.  They call it Earthquake<br/>Valley!  San Andreas fault, if you please.  I was also<br/>in Ranchita looking at properties.  I even drove down<br/>the hill to Borrrego Springs to the supermarket.  I<br/>liked it. The temperature was only 247 degrees<br/>Farenheit!</p><p>If I&apos;d had any idea that you lived there I would have<br/>tried to find you.
