I believe that Patch&apos;s anti -establishment<br/>views would have been sympathetic to the notion that the performing the works of dead<br/>Composers is about as un corporeal as you could get. As a society , it seems much more<br/>productive to water the budding flowers as opposed to collecting the best of Dead Leaves.<br/>After all there are the &quot;dreamers that remain&quot;.<br/>Why is it as soon as Morton Feldman died everyone started recording him? Must our Composers be<br/>Martyrs. If more people are alive today, than have ever lived (in total!) I can assume that<br/>there are more great composers alive now than have ever existed. and i am not getting a chance<br/>to hear them!</p><p>&quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  I do believe, however,<br/>&gt; that it is possible to fall into a trap, out of a sincere desire to<br/>&gt; propagate the authentic essence of a composer, to contribute to the<br/>&gt; death of his/her works by pinching off all innovation.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
