I believe that Patch&apos;s anti -establishment<br/>views would have been sympathetic to the notion that the performing the works of dead<br/>Composers is about as un corporeal as you could get. As a society , it seems much more<br/>productive to water the budding flowers as opposed to collecting the best of Dead Leaves.<br/>After all there are the &quot;dreamers that remain&quot;.<br/>Why is it as soon as Morton Feldman died everyone started recording him? Must our Composers be<br/>Martyrs. If more people are alive today, than have ever lived (in total!)
