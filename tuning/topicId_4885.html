Take note, Darren McDougall (none of the JI interpretations<br/>of Wild&apos;s scale can exploit this property as well as the original 11-of-31<br/>tuning)!</p><p>&gt;Producing a 12-out-of-N scale demonstrating this property can be done,<br/>&gt;but selects a different subset of the vertices than one might<br/>&gt;choose for having nice major triads, or 4:5:67 chords.</p><p>Absolutely. Interestingly, the two approaches are not always unrelated. Your<br/>observation about 31-tET means that in 31-tET, the unison vector 3^8*7^(-7)<br/>(or 839808:823543) vanishes. Meantone temperament has more nice major and<br/>minor triads than JI (in a 7-tone diatonic scale) _because_ in meantone a<br/>chain of four &quot;3/2&quot;&apos;s is equal to &quot;5/4&quot; (after octave reduction). At the end<br/>of this list&apos;s tenure on the Mills server, we (Carl Lumma, Dave Keenan, Paul<br/>Hahn, . . .) began a discussion about the best 12-note scales for 7-limit<br/>tetrads, and even given a tight (&#xFFFD;3 cent) tolerance on the 7-limit<br/>consonances, it seemed clear that the solution would _not_ be in JI but<br/>would exploit a tuning where stacking two &quot;3/2&quot;&apos;s and two &quot;5/4&quot;&apos;s would<br/>equal &quot;7/4&quot; (after octave reduction), and that the result would allow three<br/>&quot;4:5:6:7&quot; chords and three &quot;1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4&quot; chords. Carl Lumma was<br/>responsible for this insight, but his result seemed to be traceable to<br/>Fokker, and Dave Keenan showed how the tight tolerance could be acheived. In<br/>72-tone equal temperament (my suggestion for an ET version of Keenan&apos;s<br/>non-JI non-ET solution), the result (0 5 12 16 23 30 35 42 49 53 58 65) can<br/>be diagrammed as follows:<br/>                                                       /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/<br/>                                                      30-/---\--0--/-<br/>                                                     /|\/     \/| /<br/>                                                    / |/\     /\|/<br/>                                  53--------23--------65--------35<br/>                                 /|\       /|\&grave;.  /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/<br/>                                / | \     / | \  5--/---\--49 /<br/>                               /  16--------58 \ | /     \ | /<br/>                              /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/  &grave;.\|/       \|/<br/>                             30-/---\--0--/------42--------12<br/>                            /|\/     \/| /<br/>                           / |/\     /\|/<br/>         53--------23--------65--------35<br/>        /|\       /|\&grave;.  /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/<br/>       / | \     / | \  5--/---\--49 /<br/>      /  16--------58 \ | /     \ | /<br/>     /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/  &grave;.\|/       \|/<br/>    30-/---\--0--/------42--------12<br/>   /|\/     \ | /<br/>  / |/\     /\|/<br/>----65--------35<br/>/,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/</p><p>Incidentally, the equivalent scale in 31-tone equal temperament appears to<br/>be best 12-tone scale for tetrads in 31-tET as well, still giving six<br/>tetrads, though in 31-tET more of the other intervals are consonant (and so<br/>more connections would appear on this diagram) than in 72-tET, though the<br/>maximum deviation from JI doubles.</p><p>Back in the world of 17-cent tolerances, my decatonic solution for<br/>integrating large numbers of 7-limit tetrads into a pseudo-diatonic scale<br/>exploits the fact that in certain tunings, such as 22-tone equal<br/>temperament, a &quot;7/5&quot; equals a &quot;10/7&quot;, and two &quot;4/3&quot;&apos;s equal a &quot;7/4&quot; (see<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>).</p></div><h3>McDougall, Darren Scott - MCDDS001 &#x3C;MCDDS001@xxxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/1999 9:06:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, it&apos;s me again.</p><p>&gt; Bob Valentine wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;As an example, I was working through some 12-out-of-N tunings in 31tet,<br/>&gt; &gt;trying to maximize the existance of certain intervals in the tuning.
