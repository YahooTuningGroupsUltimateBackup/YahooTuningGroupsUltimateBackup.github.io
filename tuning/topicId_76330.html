The de facto condition is  almost 100% equal<br/>temperament for Bach, which he did not do.  There is  quite a consensus now that<br/>Bach did not do ET.  And yet we are stuck with  only Bach, Beethoven and<br/>Mozart.  This is a sad reality.  Any, I  repeat, any unequal well temperament would<br/>do better than ET.  No?</p><p>Neil:  So, it&apos;s becoming ever more disappointing to watch rather  intelligent<br/>folks on this forum STILL duking it out over this way tired subject.

I spent my lifetime trying  to find out,<br/>and continue to do so.  When my book is released I will give a  full<br/>rationale for conclusions.  Truth is, Neil, you don&apos;t know.   Raising Wendy&apos;s old<br/>views about meantone ignore the material that proves that a  meantone compass<br/>cannot include the majority of Bach&apos;s works.  Sorry, if  strong convictions are<br/>contrary to your modis operandi.  Sorry I can&apos;t  simply just agree with everyone<br/>on the List.  But I am honestly presenting  an informed point of view.</p><p>Neil:  but, I don&apos;t know...neither do you.

For me it is the long trail following a<br/>masters thesis.  It is painful to hear Mozart in ET when it is so  expressive, with<br/>deeper dimensions of meaning provided by ANY unequal  temperament.  Brad has<br/>capitalized on this phenomenon.  Only his is a  modern device.  I have<br/>invented nothing.  Neil, please keep your  students safe.</p><p>**************Wondering what&apos;s for Dinner Tonight?
