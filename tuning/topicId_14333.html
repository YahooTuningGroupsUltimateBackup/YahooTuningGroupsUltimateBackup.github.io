I&apos;ll be able, starting with that, to<br/>clarify my ideas. Before to comment, I&apos;ll take time to analyse your<br/>response and see what are the main points on which I could give better<br/>explanations. For the moment, I&apos;ll note only few details at the beginning<br/>of your response.</p><p>You wrote :</p><p>&gt;Those look correct, but . . .<br/>&gt;&gt; ( 3/2  4/3 20/9) == (108:135:160) == (20,864,1080)<br/>&gt;&gt; ( 3/2  4/3  9/4) == (4:5:6)       == (20,30,6)<br/>&gt;I believe you mean 15/8 instead of 4/3 in the two chords above.</p><p>Oh! yes. It&apos;s (G B D). Thank you for correction.</p><p>Then you wrote :</p><p>&gt;Those would be the four best concordances<br/>&gt;against the 1/1 in the octave above it.<br/>&gt;Or if you also went into the octave below,<br/>&gt;the four best concordances against the 1/1<br/>&gt;would be an octave below 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, and 8/5.<br/>&gt;If you then allowed octave-<br/>&gt;equivalence, you have a total of seven tones<br/>&gt;per octave (this seems to help lead to what<br/>&gt;you do below -- let me know if it is a misinterpretation).</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s not what I wanted to say. It is totally equivalent to start with<br/>the four ratios below unison (3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5), but free use principle<br/>is applied only to 5 tones (unison + the 4 chosen tones, above or below)<br/>and not applied to 7 tones.</p><p>[ For this brief comment, I&apos;ll use the term &quot;tone&quot; as equivalent to French<br/>&quot;ton&quot;. This sense is maybe not valid in English. Let me know if yes or no<br/>and how I could translate if it&apos;s not valid. Tone, in that sense, don&apos;t<br/>correspond to pitch or frequency but only to interval modulo 2.]</p><p>The heuristic process try (arbitrary) to build a coherent set of tones<br/>beginning with unison (1) and 4 other tones chosen here for exceptional<br/>concordance qualities. (I could start with different tones). After that,<br/>there is no subsequent direct choice of tones but only a principle choice :<br/>free use of these 5 tones.</p><p>In N-tET context it&apos;s almost insignificant for there is no possibility to<br/>exceed N tones. In JI context, you have to restrict free use to few tones<br/>only for you go toward infinity using freely intervals of intervals of<br/>intervals...</p><p>What means free use ? Harmonicaly, it means you can use all these tones as<br/>a chord. Melodicaly, it means you can use all possibilities in succession<br/>for these tones. Then the set of all tones (13 dyads including<br/>unison-unison) spanned by all pentads (and subchords) of this chord and the<br/>set of all possible steps (13 steps modulo 2 including repetition) in all<br/>sequences (using frequencies having with a tonic these 5 tones) are<br/>strictly equivalent.</p><p>So the choice to use freely the 5 starting tones (1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3)<br/>implies surging (verticaly and horizontaly) of 8 other tones. These 13<br/>tones are not equivalent. It would be aberrant to use freely (16/15 10/9<br/>9/8). The intervals between these tones, in our chosen context, are not<br/>tones as such but modal sruties with which is excluded building of chord<br/>and making of melodic steps.</p><p>Until now, nothing has been said about particular coherence of these 13<br/>tones (or much other coherent choice). It&apos;s toward what I want to progress<br/>once ambiguities will be eliminated.</p><p>I announce here what is in view. There are two coherence levels. The first<br/>level is strictly mathematical (how algebra is possible without closure<br/>axiom). The second level refer to tonal categorization (how congruence<br/>class of tones may arised and how it is, in same time, similar and<br/>different of linguistic structures).</p><p>I&apos;ll give later more structured comments starting with your questions.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div>
