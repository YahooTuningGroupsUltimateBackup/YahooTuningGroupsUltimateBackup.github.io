I was talking to Mike about a paper I have written in which the principle of wave addition is conserved under a relativistic transformation, and which incidentally the current view of &quot;dispersive&quot; waves does not achieve (e.g. Since quantum light and matter waves  rely on the emission and absorption of frequency-energy, then these are concerned with the difference and sum and are familiar as a type of beat frequencies. In other words, they can still be periodic since this is independent of the question of rationality and so forth).</p><p>But my actual question to the group was whether or not all irrational intervals could in fact be approximations to rational intervals in the higher octaves of the harmonic series. Just as one among many examples, the ratio 181/128 approximates the flat fifth (sq root of 2) to 3 decimal places. If we cannot make a distinction past a certain number of decimal places, then it might be just as valid to argue that the tempered system is an approximation to harmonics after all. Or it might be undecidable and depend upon harmonic context?</p><p>As to your statement that periodic functions and Fourier analysis have been known for centuries, well I&apos;ll admit they have been used uncritically for centuries. For despite widespread &quot;scientific&quot; belief, these are not primordial concepts at all but rely on a number system dating as far back as Pythagoras. If you look at the basic sine wave, then space and time are quantities that are defined in proportion to wavelength and period, the factor of proportionality being the number of cycles. In other words, the very idea of proportion and ratio was written into the sine wave from the very beginning. Mechanics seems to have forgotten that it was in fact Pythagoras (circa 570 B. C.) who invented maths-science when he discovered that the world of harmonia, seen by the Greeks to the very source of natural mystery and wonder, corresponded to the series of natural numbers. Scientists then (albeit unwittingly) rewrote history to make it appear that it was wholly<br/> deducible from mechanics. Therefore, when the matter wave was discovered in 1928, instead of this being hailed as a remarkable and uncanny confirmation of Pythagoras, they continued to reduce it to mechanics, hence, the self-contradictory view of dispersive waves which do not conserve periodicity under transformation and therefore contravene the principle of relativity (i.e. the condition that the math&apos;l form of a law be the same for all observers. Apparently, the laws of musical harmony are not considered worthy. But in fact they apply to all waves and therefore have relevance for all physics).</p><p>So how could scientists miss such a basic oversight for so long? Well you answered this yourself; &quot;I find it unlikely that you have discovered anything new&quot;. Since you are merely making a premature guess, then I would say that this type of attitude is the true source of ill-defined terminology. Mathematics is a big field my friend and wave theory is really in its infancy.</p><p>      Get the name you always wanted with the new y7mail email address.<br/><a href="http://www.yahoo7.com.au/mail">www.yahoo7.com.au/mail</a></p></div><h3><a id=76808 href="#76808">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2008 6:08:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>rick ballan wrote:</p><p>&gt; But my actual question to the group was whether or not all irrational &gt; intervals could in fact be approximations to rational intervals in the &gt; higher octaves of the harmonic series.

Furthermore, just apply this concept to every step in<br/>the scale.</p><p>Rick&apos;s theory, as far as I understand it is actually a restatement of<br/>what you said - that any measurement will break down beyond the Planck<br/>scale. So Rick is saying that when we say that equal temperament is<br/>made up of waves that are in irrational proportions to one another, it<br/>is actually so that they are not, because the measurements that we<br/>have to determine their relationship to one another are of limited<br/>accuracy, not only due to practical reasons, but due to this<br/>theoretical constraint. Furthermore, I think he&apos;s saying that it&apos;s not<br/>the measurements that break down at this level, but that there is<br/>theoretically no smaller unit that can exist than that of the Planck<br/>length. I think he&apos;s taking the Planck length as it applies to<br/>measurements of space and is applying it to the frequency/periodicity<br/>of waveforms.</p><p>So he&apos;s not saying that these irrational numbers are just APPROXIMATED<br/>by a continued fraction sequence, but that there is a point in which<br/>there is NO DIFFERENCE from a certain term arbitrarily far into the<br/>sequence and the irrational number itself as it applies to the<br/>frequency of a given wave, as the difference in the wavelength would<br/>be small enough that it would be undetectable (or not exist). This<br/>obviously doesn&apos;t apply to the abstract concept of numbers themselves,<br/>but when they are instantiated in reality, then these theoretical<br/>limits would apply.</p><p>At least that&apos;s what I think he&apos;s saying. And furthermore, he seems to<br/>have been met with some positive response, as a lot of people have<br/>responded that 19/16 sounds much more like the &quot;minor&quot; chord they are<br/>used to than 6/5.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sun, Jun 1, 2008 at 6:05 PM, Tom Dent &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still have no idea what Rick is talking about.
