The book is &quot;Fractals<br/>in Music, Introductory Mathematics for Musical Analysis.&quot; I don&apos;t know<br/>quite what to make of the ad. Some of the topics seem to be taken from<br/>regular musical acoustics -- feedback, acoustic impedance, throat<br/>singing overtone spectra (!), frequency dependent dispersion,  and some<br/>sound a bit stf&apos;nal-- Fibonacci numbers and form, Fourier analysis of<br/>melodic shape, self-similarity and attractors, etc. The mathematical<br/>level is stated to be only algebra and trigonometry and all computations<br/>are done with spreadsheets.</p><p>Anyway, the book is said to be available for about $US 40 from High Art<br/>Press, P.O. Box 58661, Salt Lake City, UT 84158 USA. (801) 582-5056,<br/>email <a href="mailto:HiArtPress@aol.com">HiArtPress@aol.com</a>.  It may be ordered through the Web from <a href="http://BN.com">BN.com</a><br/>(Barnes &amp;Noble), <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://Borders.com">Borders.com</a>.</p><p>--John</p></div>
