By the time<br/>of Couperin, Lindley suggests, music was being written with this kind<br/>of temperament in mind.</p><p>Whether some versions of the temperament ordinaire qualify as 12-note<br/>&quot;well-temperaments&quot; depends in part on the disposition of the fifths,<br/>and also in part on how one chooses to define the limits of sizes for<br/>&quot;acceptable&quot; thirds in a circulating scheme.</p><p>In the kind of well-temperament documented by Werckmeister and<br/>followed by various 18th-century theorists and practical musicians,<br/>all fifths are either pure or narrow of pure, and thus all major<br/>thirds no larger than Pythagorean (81:64, ~407.82 cents). In other<br/>words, they are all within a syntonic comma (81:80, ~21.51 cents) of a<br/>pure 5:4 (~386.31 cents).</p><p>In a temperament ordinaire with a circle of 12 &quot;playable&quot; fifths,<br/>ranging from around meantone to somewhat larger than pure, certain<br/>remote major thirds will be larger than Pythagorean, for example up to<br/>around 413.197 cents (Ab-C or G#-C) in Bethisy&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Such a major third (or diminished fourth) might be regarded as at<br/>least &quot;semi-interchangeable&quot; with a more usual major third for the<br/>period with a size closer to 5:4. If so, then we might speak in<br/>historical terms of a kind of well-temperament.</p><p>Starting from the idea of a temperament ordinaire as a kind of<br/>&quot;modified meantone,&quot; I considered the problem of how many fifths in a<br/>12-note tuning one can temper at 1/4-comma narrow while still<br/>balancing out the circle to keep all fifths comfortably &quot;playable,&quot;<br/>and preferably no more than 1/4-comma impure.</p><p>The solution to which I was drawn is a chain of 8 fifths (F-C#) in<br/>1/4-comma meantone, with the remaining 4 fifths each tempered wide by<br/>around 4.888 cents, or more precisely (2048/2025)^(1/4), to balance<br/>out the 12-note circle.</p><p>The ratio of 2048:2025, a &quot;diaschisma&quot; in one definition of that term<br/>(another is half of a Pythagorean diatonic semitone or limma at<br/>256:243 or ~90.22 cents, giving an interval of ~45.11 cents), is equal<br/>to the difference between a Pythagorean 81:64 major third and a 32:25<br/>major third at ~427.37 cents, about 19.55 cents.</p><p>Thus we have 8 fifths tempered at 1/4-comma narrow, and the<br/>remaining 4 fifths tempered at 1/4-diaschisma wide.</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala file for this tuning:</p><p>! qcmqd8_4.scl<br/>!<br/>F-C# in 1/4-comma meantone, other 5ths ~4.888 cents wide or (2048/2025)^(1/4)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 76.04900<br/> 193.15686<br/> 289.73529<br/> 5/4<br/> 503.42157<br/> 579.47057<br/> 696.57843<br/> 782.89214<br/> 889.73529<br/> 996.57843<br/> 1082.89214<br/> 2/1</p><p>From a 17th-19th century historical perspective, this circle of 12<br/>fifths is _not_ a &quot;well-temperament,&quot; because the 32:25 major third or<br/>diminished fourth at C#/Db-F is hardly interchangeable with a major<br/>third at or reasonably near 5:4.</p><p>However, from the 21st-century perspective of a &quot;mixed&quot; style<br/>combining Renaissance meantone with neo-Gothic sonorities and<br/>progressions where anything from 81:64 to a bit beyond 9:7 (~435.08<br/>cents) is routinely accepted as a &quot;major third,&quot; this is a kind of<br/>well-temperament with striking contrasts of &quot;modal color.&quot;</p><p>In choosing a chain of 8 meantone fifths from F to C#, the idea is at<br/>once to get an ideally smooth &quot;16th-century&quot; flavor for sonorities<br/>within this range, and also to make the common thirds Bb-D and E-G#<br/>not too far from 5:4, although they are inevitably somewhat<br/>compromised by Renaissance standards.</p><p>The major third E-G# can be an especially delicate point for a 12-note<br/>circle, since this third from around 1520 on is used prominently in<br/>pieces in various modes, and often appears in closing sonorities in<br/>the Phrygian mode (E-E).</p><p>In this scheme, E-G# and Bb-D are tuned at around 396.578 cents, or<br/>about 10.265 cents wide of 5:4 -- a bit less than 1/2 syntonic comma.</p><p>By comparison, in various well-temperaments of the late 17th-19th<br/>centuries, E-G# tends to be somewhat wider, often larger than in<br/>12-EDO at 400 cents.</p><p>Once we move out of the Bb-G# region, of course, things move quickly<br/>toward Pythagorean and beyond. The thirds Eb-G and B-D#/Eb are close<br/>to Pythagorean at ~406.843 cents; Ab/G#-C and F#-Bb/A# are at ~407.108<br/>cents, very close to a just 14:11 (~417.508 cents); and C#/Db-F is at<br/>a just 32:25.</p><p>There are also two minor thirds (C-Eb, Eb/D#-F#) at ~289.735 cents,<br/>very close to 13:11 (~289.210 cents), and two thirds (F-G#/Ab,<br/>Bb-C#/Db) at ~279.471 cents, rather close to 27:23 (~277.591 cents).</p><p>These &quot;Monzian thirds&quot; are a special adornment to a tuning. This term<br/>originated from a famous exploit of Joe Monzo, the &quot;Monz,&quot; in which he<br/>started out with 7:6 (~266.87 cents) as a possible size for an<br/>interval in a composition, but found by ear that around 279 cents<br/>sounded like the right size, eventually deciding on a rational ratio<br/>of 75:64 (~274.58 cents).</p><p>Thus any third from around 274 to 280 cents can attract the pleasant<br/>adjective &quot;Monzian.&quot;</p><p>A curious feature of this &quot;8_4&quot; tuning, in contrast to more<br/>conventional well-temperaments, is that interval sizes within a given<br/>category jump in steps of around 10.265 cents, the difference in size<br/>between the narrow fifths at 1/4 comma (~5.377 cents) smaller than pure<br/>and the wide fifths at 1/4 diaschisma (~4.888 cents) larger than pure.</p><p>Since the tuning uses only these two sizes of fifths, the 10.265-cent<br/>steps result from the replacement of a narrow meantone fifth by a wide<br/>one. With major thirds, for example, we have these possibilities with<br/>&quot;N&quot; showing a narrow fifth and &quot;W&quot; a wide one:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/> Interval       Cents      Ratio         Chain of fifths<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   A-C#       ~386.31      5:4         A   E   B   F#   C#<br/>                           just          N   N   N    N<br/>...............................................................<br/>   E-G#       ~396.58      5:4         E   B   F#   C#   G#<br/>                        +~10.27          N   N    N    W<br/>...............................................................<br/>   B-D#/Eb    ~406.84     81:64        B   F#   C#   G#   D#<br/>                         -~0.98          N    N    W    W<br/>...............................................................<br/>   F#-A#/Bb   ~417.11     14:11        F#   C#   G#   D#   A#<br/>                         -~0.40           N    W    W    W<br/>...............................................................<br/>   C#/Db-F    ~427.37     32:25        Db   Ab   Eb   Bb   F<br/>                          just            W    W    W    W<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This scheme, to conclude, is like some versions of the temperament<br/>ordinaire in combining narrow and wide fifths to form a 12-note circle<br/>where all of these intervals are reasonably close to pure; but it<br/>differs in including a major third or diminished fourth as large as<br/>32:25, identical to the diminished fourths of 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>Since in the kind of neo-medieval style favored for the more remote<br/>transpositions, a 32:25 major third is routine, a special kind of<br/>&quot;well-temperament&quot; results in this musical context.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38930 href="#38930">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2002 7:54:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hello Margo,</p><p>thanks very much for this post!  indeed, Chaumont&apos;s tuning<br/>is a form of &quot;temperament ordinaire&quot; -- and based on the<br/>information you provided here, my opinion is that this<br/>term should be included in the Tuning Dictionary as a<br/>separate family of tunings distinct from &quot;well-temperaments&quot;.</p><p>the interesting feature that relates them both together<br/>is that the 5th which is notated as the &quot;wolf&quot; turns out<br/>to be quite close in size to the &quot;regular&quot; 5ths, which<br/>has the effect of closing the scale at 12 tones.</p><p>in a well-temperament, all 5ths are within a few cents<br/>of being the same size (pretty close to Pythagorean or 12edo),<br/>whereas in a _temperament ordinaire_ most 5ths are derived<br/>from a meantone (quite a bit smaller than Pythagorean) and<br/>a few (usually two) are quite large.</p><p>i agree with Lindley that a misreading may have been the<br/>original stimulus in creating _temperament ordinaire_,<br/>only because it makes a lot of sense and this kind of<br/>thing has happened before -- the association of Greek<br/>names with the modes which are in use today is the result<br/>of a medieval misreading in which Frankish scribes took<br/>the ancient Greek descriptions of tone and semitone patterns<br/>to apply to an ascending scale, whereas the Greeks had<br/>applied them to descending scales.  the result is that<br/>the old Greek names and the old modes are both still used,<br/>but the associations connecting the names and modes is<br/>completely different than that given by the Greeks.</p><p>the fact that this plausible misreading of meantone instructions<br/>results in a tuning which closes at 12 tones -- rather than<br/>being left open as in meantone -- would be enough to ensure<br/>some measure of popularity on keyboard instruments with the<br/>conventional Halberstadt design.</p><p>if i get some time, i hope to explore your new _temperament<br/>ordinaire_ more fully, and perhaps even make a lattice diagram<br/>and webpage about it.  i have been making quite a few lattices<br/>of well-temperaments and meantones, actually cutting and taping<br/>them physically to create cylinders which show the closure of<br/>the system in one dimension.</p><p>and thanks also for naming a family of intervals after me!!</p><p>-monz<br/>&quot;all roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;M.

The thirds Eb-G and B-D#/Eb are close<br/>&gt; to Pythagorean at ~406.843 cents; Ab/G#-C and F#-Bb/A# are at ~407.108<br/>&gt; cents, very close to a just 14:11 (~417.508 cents); and C#/Db-F is at<br/>&gt; a just 32:25.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are also two minor thirds (C-Eb, Eb/D#-F#) at ~289.735 cents,<br/>&gt; very close to 13:11 (~289.210 cents), and two thirds (F-G#/Ab,<br/>&gt; Bb-C#/Db) at ~279.471 cents, rather close to 27:23 (~277.591 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These &quot;Monzian thirds&quot; are a special adornment to a tuning.

With major thirds, for example, we have these possibilities with<br/>&gt; &quot;N&quot; showing a narrow fifth and &quot;W&quot; a wide one:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;  Interval       Cents      Ratio         Chain of fifths<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;    A-C#       ~386.31      5:4         A   E   B   F#   C#<br/>&gt;                            just          N   N   N    N<br/>&gt; ...............................................................<br/>&gt;    E-G#       ~396.58      5:4         E   B   F#   C#   G#<br/>&gt;                         +~10.27          N   N    N    W<br/>&gt; ...............................................................<br/>&gt;    B-D#/Eb    ~406.84     81:64        B   F#   C#   G#   D#<br/>&gt;                          -~0.98          N    N    W    W<br/>&gt; ...............................................................<br/>&gt;    F#-A#/Bb   ~417.11     14:11        F#   C#   G#   D#   A#<br/>&gt;                          -~0.40           N    W    W    W<br/>&gt; ...............................................................<br/>&gt;    C#/Db-F    ~427.37     32:25        Db   Ab   Eb   Bb   F<br/>&gt;                           just            W    W    W    W<br/>&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This scheme, to conclude, is like some versions of the temperament<br/>&gt; ordinaire in combining narrow and wide fifths to form a 12-note circle<br/>&gt; where all of these intervals are reasonably close to pure; but it<br/>&gt; differs in including a major third or diminished fourth as large as<br/>&gt; 32:25, identical to the diminished fourths of 1/4-comma meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since in the kind of neo-medieval style favored for the more remote<br/>&gt; transpositions, a 32:25 major third is routine, a special kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;well-temperament&quot; results in this musical context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38970 href="#38970">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2002 6:40:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote [#38930]:<br/>&gt; hello Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanks very much for this post!  indeed, Chaumont&apos;s tuning<br/>&gt; is a form of &quot;temperament ordinaire&quot; -- and based on the<br/>&gt; information you provided here, my opinion is that this<br/>&gt; term should be included in the Tuning Dictionary as a<br/>&gt; separate family of tunings distinct from &quot;well-temperaments&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the interesting feature that relates them both together<br/>&gt; is that the 5th which is notated as the &quot;wolf&quot; turns out<br/>&gt; to be quite close in size to the &quot;regular&quot; 5ths, which<br/>&gt; has the effect of closing the scale at 12 tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in a well-temperament, all 5ths are within a few cents<br/>&gt; of being the same size (pretty close to Pythagorean or 12edo),<br/>&gt; whereas in a _temperament ordinaire_ most 5ths are derived<br/>&gt; from a meantone (quite a bit smaller than Pythagorean) and<br/>&gt; a few (usually two) are quite large.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i agree with Lindley that a misreading may have been the<br/>&gt; original stimulus in creating _temperament ordinaire_ ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the fact that this plausible misreading of meantone instructions<br/>&gt; results in a tuning which closes at 12 tones -- rather than<br/>&gt; being left open as in meantone -- would be enough to ensure<br/>&gt; some measure of popularity on keyboard instruments with the<br/>&gt; conventional Halberstadt design.</p><p>Monz,</p><p>This sounds very much like a temperament I came up with in the<br/>early &apos;70s (it appeared in _Xenharmonikon_ #5), and it&apos;s nice to see<br/>that there&apos;s a name for this particular class of temperaments, even<br/>if the term &quot;ordinaire&quot; is not really very descriptive.
