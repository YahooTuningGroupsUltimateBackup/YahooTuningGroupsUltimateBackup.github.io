This beam of sound<br/>behaves just like a beam of light - &apos;shining&apos; it at a specific listener allows<br/>only that person to hear it, and projecting it against a surface creates an<br/>acoustic &apos;image&apos; at the point of reflection. It is the first device that<br/>provides total control over both the locationanddistributionof high quality<br/>sound, something impossible to achieve with traditional loudspeakers.<br/>&gt; The circular transducer is very thin, and can be constructed in a variety of<br/>sizes and configurations as needed. A typical Audio Spotlight transducer has an<br/>active area of approximately 1 foot diameter, and, depending on size and<br/>frequency content, projects an approximately three-degree wide beam of sound<br/>audible to well over 100 meters. Harmonic distortion has been reduced to close<br/>to that of a traditional loudspeaker, sound level is quite appreciable (on the<br/>order of 80-90dBA) at several meters, and frequency response, depending on size,<br/>extends down to a few hundred Hertz, and upwards beyond the range of hearing.<br/>Continued research is being conducted on all facets of the technology.While<br/>still under development, we are testing applications of the device in<br/>collaboration with several of our Media Lab Sponsors<br/>[<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/Sponsors">http://www.media.mit.edu/Sponsors</a>]in preparation for eventual commercial<br/>release.<br/>PUT SOUND WHEREVERYOU WANT <a href="http://IT.TM">IT.TM</a></p><p>[joe_array.jpg]<br/>Photo (c) 1998 Web ChappellF. Joseph Pompei<br/><a href="mailto:pompei@media.mit.edu">pompei@media.mit.edu</a> [pompei@media.mit.edu]&gt;</p><p>Usage&gt; The Audio Spotlight can be used in two major ways: As directed audio, sound is<br/>directed at a specific listener or area, to provide a private or area specific<br/>listening space. As projected audio, sound is projected against a distant<br/>object, creating an audio image. This audio image is literally a projected<br/>loudspeaker - sound appears to come directly from the projection, just like<br/>light.</p><p>[uses2.jpg]</p><p>&gt; The Audio Spotlight consists of a thin, circular transducer array and a<br/>specially designed signal processor and amplifier. The transducer is about half<br/>an inch thick, nonmagnetic, and lightweight. The signal processor and amplifier<br/>are integrated into a unit about the same size as a traditional audio amplifier,<br/>and has similar power requirements.<br/>Technology&gt; Because it is impossible to generate extremely narrow beams of audible<br/>sound without extremely large loudspeaker arrays, we instead generate the sound<br/>indirectly, using the nonlinearity of the air to convert a narrow beam of<br/>ultrasound into a highly directive, audible beam of sound.[beam.jpg]<br/>&gt; The device transmits a narrow beam of ultrasound (blue), which, due to the<br/>inherent nonlinearity of the air itself, distorts (changes shape) very slightly<br/>as it travels. This distortion creates, along with new ultrasonic frequencies,<br/>audible artifacts (green) which can be mathematically predicted, and therefore<br/>controlled. By constructing the proper ultrasonic beam, this nonlinearity can be<br/>used to create, within the beam itself, an audible sound beam containing any<br/>sound desired. This is presently done in real-time using low cost circuitry, a<br/>specially designed amplifier, and transducers developed at MIT specifically for<br/>this project.Hyperdirectivity</p><p>The directivity, or narrowness, of an acoustic wave generated by a circular<br/>transducer is proportional to the ratio of the diameter of the transducer to the<br/>wavelength of the sound. So a transducer much larger than the wavelength of the<br/>sound creates a very narrow beam.</p><p>Audible sound contains wavelengths reaching lengths of several feet, so a<br/>reasonably sized loudspeaker will alwaysproduce a very wide, non-directional<br/>source at lower frequencies. The Audio Spotlight, in contrast, outputs short,<br/>millimeter sized ultrasonic waves, which form a very narrow beam even in a small<br/>transducer, which in turn generates audible sound. The nature of the nonlinear<br/>transformation also essentially eliminates sidelobes in the resulting beam, and<br/>maintains relatively uniform directivity across the entire audible frequency<br/>range.</p><p>[directivity.jpg]<br/>The figure to the right compares the directivity of the Audio Spotlight (yellow)<br/>to that of an ordinary loudspeaker (purple).at 400 Hz. Note that the directivity<br/>of the Audio Spotlight is only three degrees, compared to the essentially<br/>omnidirectional directivity of the loudspeaker.</p><p>In order to obtain such narrow directivity from a traditional loudspeaker<br/>system, one would need a loudspeaker arrayfifty meters across!</p><p>A loudspeaker is like a light bulb, but the Audio Spotlight is like a laser.</p><p>History&gt; The use of nonlinear interaction of high frequency sound to generate<br/>directive low frequency sound sources has been a well researched subject in the<br/>field of underwater acoustics since the early 1960&apos;s. Often misattributed to<br/>so-called &quot;Tartini Tones&quot;, the effect is more accurately described as a<br/>parametric array, a term introduced by Westervelt [1]<br/>[<a href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#1">http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#1</a>]. In the past several decades,<br/>many underwater sonar researchers have used the effect to both generate<br/>directive low frequency sonar beams, detect underwater sound (parametric<br/>receiving array), and extend the bandwidth of underwater transducers.The first<br/>published demonstration of an airborne parametric array was in 1975 by Bennett<br/>and Blackstock [2] [<a href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#2">http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#2</a>]. Rather<br/>than using inaudible ultrasound, they instead used very intense, high frequency<br/>audible sound to produce simple difference tones. While their goal was not a<br/>practical audio reproduction device, they nonetheless effectively demonstrated<br/>that the parametric array would work in air in addition to underwater.</p><p>[yone.jpg]In the early 1980&apos;s, several Japanese companies, such as Nippon<br/>Columbia, Ricoh, and Matsushita, attempted to develop the parametric array for<br/>the reproduction of broadband audible sound. They typically deployed large<br/>arrays containing hundreds of piezoelectric transducers, such as the one to the<br/>right [3] [<a href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#3">http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#3</a>], to transmit simple<br/>AM modulated audible signals. While successful in reproducing sound, tremendous<br/>problems with cost, robustness, and extremely poor sound quality (up to 50%<br/>total harmonic distortion) caused them to abandon the technology as unfeasible.</p><p>[piezo.jpg]More recently in mid 1996, an American company produced their own<br/>version of this device and proclaimed it &apos;a revolution&apos; in audio. In fact, this<br/>device, contrary to their claims and unbeknownst to the popular press, was very<br/>similar to those described in audio journals a decade earlier (shown to the<br/>left), and of course suffered from the very same problems of poor sound quality<br/>and lack of robustness that plagued the earlier researchers [4]<br/>[<a href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/AUDITORY/asamtgs/asa97snd/2pEA/2pEA5.html">http://sound.media.mit.edu/AUDITORY/asamtgs/asa97snd/2pEA/2pEA5.html</a>]. Since<br/>then, there has been no published evidence of progress towards a practical<br/>device.</p><p>Background&gt; Since his days as a part-time musician and young acoustics engineer at<br/>Bose in the early 1990&apos;s, Mr. Pompei recognized that a key ingredient missing<br/>from audio reproduction was the ability to reliably spatialize sound.While in a<br/>natural environment, sound occurs all around us, giving us a tremendously strong<br/>impression of our environment, the reproduction of sound over loudspeakers, at<br/>best, provides a very vague and limited spatial impression. Similarly, what was<br/>missing from music, he decided, was the ability to choreograph musical<br/>instruments in space, just as you would dancers.While pursuing as a Master&apos;s<br/>student techniques related to &apos;3D Audio&apos; technologies, he realized that this<br/>method would simply not work in an uncontrolled acoustic environment - if the<br/>listener moved out of the small &apos;sweet spot&apos;, the illusion would vanish, and<br/>there were no practical remedies to this problem, so long as traditional<br/>loudspeakers were used. The solution, then, was to not rely on psychoacoustic<br/>illusions, but instead to create sound independently of the loudspeaker. One of<br/>several ideas he had at the time was the use of interacting ultrasound beams to<br/>produce audible sound.</p><p>&gt; After briefly researching the idea, he discovered the numerous papers describing<br/>the underwater parametric array and the earlier attempts of its application as<br/>an audible sound source. From these papers, he saw that there were two key<br/>concepts which were overlooked in the previous attempts, mitigating their<br/>success: * Preprocessing<br/> * Earlier attempts used simple AM modulation to generate the ultrasound<br/>   signal, which does create audible byproducts, but also substantial<br/>   distortion. The nonlinear transformation from ultrasound to audible sound is<br/>   much more complex than AM demodulation. Therefore, in order to reduce<br/>   distortion, this specific transformation needed to be mathematically modeled,<br/>   inverted, and then applied as a preprocessing algorithm. The lowest-order<br/>   preprocessing method, used in the earliest MIT prototypes, was derived from a<br/>   simple model [5] [<a href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#5">http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#5</a>]proposed in<br/>   1965.<br/>   Transducer Design<br/> * The transducers used in previous attempts were common piezoelectric<br/>   transducers used for ultrasonic ranging. These transducers are highly<br/>   resonant, and do not have sufficient bandwidth to reliably reproduce the<br/>   preprocessed ultrasonic signal. Thus, even with a preprocessing algorithm,<br/>   substantial distortion would continue to result until we developed<br/>   transducers capable of reliably reproducting the broadband preprocessed<br/>   signal.</p><p>As a side project during his Master&apos;s work, he continued his development of<br/>these ideas, studying nonlinear wave interactions and ultrasonic transducer<br/>design, eventually deciding to pursue the area as the focus of a doctoral<br/>dissertation. Of all the universities that he applied to, he decided that the<br/>free-wheeling nature of the MIT Media Lab [<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">http://www.media.mit.edu/</a>] was the<br/>ideal environment for developing the idea.The first full size prototype was<br/>demonstrated in April 1998 to our Media Lab Sponsors, and performed beyond all<br/>expectations. The first demonstration was a John Coltrane solo, whose saxophone<br/>was heard loud and clear, projected like a spotlight all around a movie theater,<br/>and flying right over the audience. Power consumption was nominal (A paper [6] [<a href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#6">http://sound.media.mit.edu/~pompei/spotlight/#6</a>]describing the<br/>results of the first prototype, as well as a live demonstration, were presented<br/>at the 105th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society in September, 1998, and<br/>received a standing ovation. While the parametric array itself is not<br/>patentable, MIT has applied for patents on key aspects of the technology which<br/>make it a practical device.</p><p>[400Hz_small.jpg][distortion.jpg]This directivity plot of a prototype clearly<br/>illustrates the extreme narrowness of the beam. (Published in [6]).During the<br/>summer of 1998, we compared distortion of prior devices with our prototype. Note<br/>that distortion has been reduced nearly to that of a traditional loudspeaker.<br/>(Published in [6]).</p><p>Since then, development has been remarkably productive, with engineering and<br/>mathematical advances resulting in more sound output, better sound quality, and<br/>reliable performance.</p><p>&quot;Everything you do with light, you can now do with sound.&quot;TM</p><p>REFERENCES:<br/>[1] Westervelt, P.
