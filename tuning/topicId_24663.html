Far the most effective<br/>method I have discovered is the use of a color analogy employing<br/>small blocks of colored lacquer under each string for each of the<br/>desired ratios. When such fingerboards have been used, intonation has<br/>generally been excellent; when they have been discarded, intonation<br/>has deteriorated immediatedly. It is rather sad, but I fear that most<br/>cellists would rather commit an indecent act than allow another<br/>cellist to catch them with a colored fingerboard.&quot;</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon</p></div>
