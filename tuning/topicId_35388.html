This is basically the assumption behind my<br/>&gt; recent posts.  I probably should have said this earlier. :)<br/>&gt;</p><p>I really do not want to be insulting, but this is idiocy.  Assumptions are a<br/>poor basis for preaching on the internet.<br/>Feeding a recording proves nothing.  It is a bit shocking that Carl does not<br/>understand this.  For myself, I refuse to be reduced to Carl&apos;s expectations.<br/>He is now doing real harm regarding what people feel they should believe<br/>about microtonal performance and he has practically no experience as a<br/>performing musician.  Maybe he tells his doctors how to diagnose his ailments<br/>rather than accept professional medical advice.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
