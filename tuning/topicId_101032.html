In the first part of the recording, I was playing it like a shakuhachi, then I switched to the way a Bulgarian kaval is played -- i.e. &quot;sideways&quot;. Interestingly, the former method is good for lower tones while the latter is better for higher tones.</p><p>Obviously, if I take off the head joint, then all the effective wavelengths are much shorter than they should be; so two fingerings which would normally play, for example, C4-C5, don&apos;t make octaves at all.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
