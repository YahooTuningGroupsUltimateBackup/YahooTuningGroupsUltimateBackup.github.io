Still, linguistic change is in good measure driven generationally. Maybe the new meaning for &quot;gay&quot; will win, and maybe it won&apos;t. It hasn&apos;t yet; it&apos;s still youth slang, and some people don&apos;t like it. Some people are certainly going to continue to dislike it so long as &quot;gay&quot; also carries the mean of &quot;homosexual&quot;.

So they tried to<br/>get the dictionary changed in accordance with the meaning of the word<br/>as used in common usage. In fact, I think it would be pretty groovy if<br/>we could get that change enacted in real life sometimes.</p><p>It&apos;s like my uncle out in LA, who has a collection of blackface<br/>minstrelsy-inspired stuff around his house, salt and pepper shakers<br/>and all that. I went out there a few summers ago and asked about it,<br/>because I only knew of that stuff as an obvious and overtly racist<br/>characterization of black people that I thought went out of style half<br/>a century ago. He said that it didn&apos;t have anything to do with black<br/>people, that it was just a nice, cartoon-ish character from his youth,<br/>and that &quot;obnoxious liberals&quot; as he put it were basically trying to<br/>encroach on happy memories from his childhood. etc.</p><p>That being said, I still choose to not use that word, unless I&apos;m in a<br/>group of people where I know its meaning is going to be interpreted<br/>like &quot;hey, your choice of slang reminds me of being a harmless and<br/>innocent little kid&quot; and not &quot;hey, your choice of slang unfortunately<br/>reminds me of being a gay kid in a straight world.&quot; Perhaps Carl&apos;s<br/>posting it here was an overassumption on his part that everyone would<br/>interpret the word closer to the former sense, or would forgive any<br/>unfortunate associations arising from the latter sense. But in<br/>reality, there&apos;s no issue, because Carl&apos;s gambit was right - we all<br/>know that Carl doesn&apos;t really hate gay people, so life will go on<br/>without any real grief coming out of it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>domeofatonement &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 9:35:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &nbsp; What&apos;s far worse still...is trying to belittle someone by being passive aggressive IE &quot;I&apos;m sorry you have such a tough time expressing even basic thoughts...perhaps you should read a book on fifth grade English.&quot;&nbsp; It insults them in context plus insults them for hoping they will be too dumb to understand their statement as an insult.</p><p>I too have always found witty insults to be the most degrading.
