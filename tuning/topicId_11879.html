It&apos;s in that vol. 1 of Guy Murchie&apos;s Music<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Spheres though.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll have to keep an eye out for this book. Another<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; semi-related book is Jesus Christ, Sun of God (that&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not a typo), Ancient Cosmology and Early Christian Symbolism<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by David Fideler.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lots of talk about ratios, words that numbers,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s how I got started on this subject.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Was your start specifically that book or someother source?<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you mean my first appearance here on <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, my first post was an article about<br/>the Hurrian tablets with the diatonic harmonies.  Or if you mean how I came about to the<br/>religious side of Pythagorean theory,  it was mostly the Joseph Campbell books, Masks of God,<br/>and Schopenhauer&apos;s &quot;World as Will and Idea&quot; (translation by Payne).  They don&apos;t talk openly<br/>about the subject though (Schopenhauer is the best writer on the subject).  Almost none of the<br/>writers do.  In fact, Joscelyn Godwin is the only one who even mentions Pythagorus openly.<br/>It&apos;s because of the links to geometry mysticism.  All those pentagrams reminding you that God<br/>has feet and hands and a head get pretty scary after a while.</p><p>&gt; --<br/>&gt; * D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>&gt; * 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>&gt; * <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
