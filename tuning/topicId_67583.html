A musician friend of mine told me, that if a band were playing<br/>together and everyones instrument was in tune except for one person,<br/>the one person with the out of tune instrument would really stand out.</p><p>    Normally, the one person would get his out of tune instrument back in<br/>tune.  Alternatively however, a different approach could be used to<br/>normalize the sound within the band, relatively speaking.</p><p>    That is, all the other band members could re-tune their in tune<br/>instruments to be out of tune the in same way the original un-tuned<br/>instrument sounded.  This way they would sound relatively the same,<br/>tuning wise.</p><p>So - this got me thinking....</p><p>In the below table, there are four instruments.  They could be guitars,<br/>or something similiar.</p><p>    Column (A) shows the frequency in hertz of four different notes,<br/>intervals played on the instruments when they are in tune. Notes,<br/>intervals, for example; b, diminished octave, C#, A#, all sound<br/>the same way on each instrument.</p><p>    Column (B) on the other hand, represents a scenario, where each of<br/>the four instruments may be tuned quite differently from each other.</p><p>Here comes the first question...</p><p>We want to match two instruments to each other in accordance with<br/>values listed in column (B)</p><p>    The important instrument is &apos;INSTRUMENT # 1&apos;.</p><p>    Constraints;</p><p>    We only get to play one note on &apos;INSTRUMENT # 1&apos;. That is 496.15104<br/>as shown in the table.</p><p>=====================================================================<br/>                                                                          Freq. in Hertz<br/>                                                               COLUMN (A)   COLUMN (B)<br/>                          NOTE    INTERVAL           IN TUNE         OUT OF TUNE<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>INSTRUMENT # 1    B                Mjr 7th          495.00        496.15104<br/>INSTRUMENT # 2         Dim. Octave.              501.6          504.1152<br/>INSTRUMENT # 3    C#              Enharmonic   270.34        269.15072<br/>INSTRUMENT # 4    A#              Aug. 6th        448.8          452.05248<br/>=====================================================================<br/>    We can only play one note on instruments #2 through #4, likewise<br/>those notes being the ones listed in column (B) for each instrument.</p><p>    What simple rule, principle, formula, will allow us to determine<br/>which instrument from #2 to #4 is tuned most closely to instrument # 1.</p><p>    Further, by knowing ONLY INSTRUMENT #1&apos;s note listed in Column (B),<br/>how can we derive the rest of its entire &apos;out of tune&apos; scale?</p><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

It looks like<br/>the formatting in your table got off somehow.  I will<br/>say this:</p><p>If all instruments in a band were out of tune by the<br/>same amount, it&apos;s true that none would stick out.  But<br/>would the audience know that they were out of tune at<br/>all?  That is, is &apos;in tuneness&apos; relative, or is there<br/>a fixed standard of it somewhere that people can actually<br/>hear?</p><p>Perhaps that&apos;s the question we&apos;ve been trying to answer<br/>on this list for at least the last 10 years......</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>misterbobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2006 2:58:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The only person on earth who really knows if something is in or out<br/>of tune is the performer. Is it what they intended, good or bad, or<br/>a happy accident surpassing expectation? Then it&apos;s in tune. If not,<br/>it&apos;s not.</p><p>In a way, there&apos;s no such thing as &quot;out of tune&quot;. What is- is.</p><p>Other judgements require two or more people agreeing on premises-<br/>this is the correct tuning, in this style thirds are consonant, in<br/>another style they&apos;re not, etc. etc.</p><p>If &quot;standing out&quot;, or sticking out like a sore thumb for that<br/>matter, was the intention of the performer, it&apos;s in tune.</p><p>&quot;Rembrant&apos;s shades of blue suck so hard, they&apos;re a totally different<br/>shade than Da Vinci&apos;s!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, they&apos;re just different.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay... they don&apos;t suck, but they don&apos;t fit in this painting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No- that&apos;s just a different kind of painting now, take it or leave<br/>it.&quot;</p><p>There is a way to state flatly whether something is in tune or not,<br/>and that is based on assumptions of internal integrity, ie.<br/>something must at least be true to itself. In a world flooded with<br/>information and disinformation, it&apos;s probably a wise assumption- a<br/>basic filter.</p><p>Shall we agree on this? Okay. Do you now concede that most of the<br/>music of the Western world for the last couple of generations is at<br/>best out of tune, and at worst deliberately dishonest? It is, if we<br/>assume that something must be true to itself. Most Western music in<br/>wide circulation is based on the idea that the tonic major triad is<br/>a calm, or happy, or sweet, or stable, consonance, and in 12-tone<br/>equal temperament this is audibly a mild dissonance, nervous<br/>cheerfulness at best: it is out of tune with what it claims to be<br/>(and what is taught to countless students, I was one of them).</p><p>Is this a theatrical deception? A resigned grimace masquerading as a<br/>smile? An irony, a post-modern satire, or just a bumbling error?</p><p>Or maybe the difference between what the major tonic triad today<br/>claims to be, and what it is, is an artistically sound mirror of a<br/>culture based on lies? Hmmm..... that would mean that there would<br/>probably be people living in the confines of the world of illusion,<br/>but most hurt by it, who would directly address or attack that<br/>fundamental bogosity. They&apos;d probably do something like, I don&apos;t<br/>know... play the false third, then bend it into an honest one, make<br/>a real point of it...  nah, that couldn&apos;t happen.</p><p>Anyway I think you&apos;re question is actually very good and interesting,<br/>it addresses some eternal practical problems. It seems to me that<br/>the best answer (we&apos;re assuming that the group and the soloist share<br/>the same musical goals) is what&apos;s always been done- an interplay,<br/>give and take. This is the hairy bitch of working with organs,<br/>klaviatura, and most synthesizers- realtime accurate flexibility of<br/>intonation is hard to do.</p><p> -Cameron Bobro</p></div>
