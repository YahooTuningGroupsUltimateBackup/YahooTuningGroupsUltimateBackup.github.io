What do you think of an<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;excursion&quot; on that, Paul?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, that is what the existing &quot;excursion&quot; is about -- in a special case.</p><p>Really?  I had a feeling the two were related (or rather, questions about<br/>what happens when notes are transposed by unison vectors came up when I was<br/>thinking about the doubling phenomenon).  Perhaps you could clarify.</p><p>&gt;So a small interval within the periodicity block is not sufficient (but<br/>&gt;of course it is necessary) to establish a periodicity within the<br/>&gt;periodicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I wonder, is there a necessary condition that we can establish?</p><p>I wish I had better tools to work with blocks, but could the doubling<br/>phenomenon be caused when one unison vector more closely approximates one<br/>of the unit vectors (i.e. 3:2) than it does the unison?  And in general,<br/>what happens when you build blocks by, say, approximating a unison on one<br/>axis, and approximating the unit vector of the first axis on the second?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
