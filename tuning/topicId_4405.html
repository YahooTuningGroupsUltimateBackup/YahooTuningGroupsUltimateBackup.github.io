A system where even the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; pentatonics is out of tune, or the error has passed on to another<br/>&gt; degree, caused all forms of beating problems that I found made it<br/>&gt; impossible to investigate the simplest of tuning structures. When I<br/>&gt; can perform such operations I might join you, until then, I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; going to sit around and wait</p><p>I haven&apos;t experienced problems with tuning accuracy, so I&apos;m curious.<br/>Also, the term &quot;accumulated error&quot; would seem to indicate a different<br/>way of using MIDI to tune.  I&apos;d be glad to address the problems you&apos;ve<br/>had - would you e-mail me (<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>)?  If we figure out what&apos;s<br/>happening, we can let the list know what pitfall(s) to avoid.</p><p>(Although it seems you&apos;re leaving the list for a while...)</p><p>[Jimmy Lewis and/or Olushola, TD 287.7:]<br/>&gt; I&apos;m amazed at this myself, I don&apos;t understand it.</p><p>Which makes me think you might be agreeing with me...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m a firm believer that people should be committed to organic<br/>&gt; processes. Practicing and playing an instrument for years definitely<br/>&gt; has a significant shaping factor that is tied to how we express our<br/>&gt; music; which is why it may not be possible for a musician to use a<br/>&gt; MIDI controller in place of an acoustic instrument.  Comments?</p><p>Which seems clearly NOT to agree.  I think the route of committment to<br/>an organic instrument is great.  I love playing a grand piano, for<br/>example, but, unfortunately, that grand can&apos;t be tuned on the fly, which<br/>is where I&apos;m going in music, so I must use a synth and/or sound card.</p><p>&gt; However I have found that technological tools are indispensible in<br/>&gt; areas related to analysis, prototyping and production.</p><p>No argument there!</p><p>[Daniel Wolf, TD 287.11:]<br/>&gt; I have to disagree with this appeal. Over the years, I&apos;ve encountered<br/>&gt; list members with every sort of Mac, every version of DOS or Windows,<br/>&gt; at least one Amiga and one Atari, quite a few Unixers, and a growing<br/>&gt; number of Linux or BeOS users. Although software is sometimes<br/>&gt; discussed, the concerns of this list are largely platform-independent,<br/>&gt; if not computer-independent; indeed, many of us still work primarily<br/>&gt; with pencil and paper!  In any case, this platform variety is a real<br/>&gt; part of this list&apos;s character.</p><p>I cannot disagree.</p><p>&gt; I agree heartily that computers are wonderful tools . Calculations,<br/>&gt; graphics, and tables are all easy to make, and the ability to<br/>&gt; synthesize .WAV files in my home studio has profoundly changed the way<br/>&gt; in which I work, although my finished scores are still intended to be<br/>&gt; read by instrumentalists and singers.</p><p>No argument again.</p><p>&gt; While I&apos;m not yet satisfied with the Internet as a vehicle for<br/>&gt; transmitting recordings of music, it is an excellent way to transmit<br/>&gt; news, theoretical writings, technical information etc., most of that<br/>&gt; encodable in plain ASCII.  Isn&apos;t that already a large enough task for<br/>&gt; this list?</p><p>.wav and even .mp3 files are large enough to be a problem, but .mid(i)<br/>files are very small.  Perhaps I should have appealed less for PC&apos;s<br/>specifically and more for any platform capable of receiving and playing<br/>.midi files.</p><p>&gt; There is also a political argument to add here.  The pressure to<br/>&gt; constantly upgrade comes at a high real cost to most users.  The newer<br/>&gt; platform or operating system or program may include a lot of<br/>&gt; attractive new features, but they are seldom made with any real sense<br/>&gt; of economy other than the desire to convince consumers that their<br/>&gt; existing system is out of date.  I still drive my Rayna box with an<br/>&gt; Atari ST without a harddrive, getting sophisticated, musical sounds<br/>&gt; with an operating system that fits on a single floppy, while Windows<br/>&gt; 98 is eating up the better part of a gigabyte on my PC.</p><p>By all means, use your existing hardware as long as it does the job!<br/>I&apos;ve got a string of now-obsolete computers, etc., etc. that I&apos;ve used<br/>to make music, and I certainly didn&apos;t let someone else&apos;s judgement that<br/>a box was old make me stop using it!</p><p>On the other hand, the &quot;pressure to constantly upgrade&quot;, real though it<br/>is, is not, of course, a mandate.  When I buy a computer, PC or<br/>otherwise, my usual course is to use it with the capabilities it&apos;s got,<br/>not to spend large amounts of money upgrading it.  If, a couple or three<br/>years later, something is available at 4 times the speed, half the<br/>price, and capable of doing things I&apos;ve always wanted to do but couldn&apos;t<br/>afford till now, I may bite again!</p><p>Yes, Windows may take a gig, but a 10 gig hard-drive is now amazingly<br/>CHEAP.  The cost of storing Windows falls even as it gets fatter.</p><p>&gt; Some of my favorite electronic music was composed with a minimum of<br/>&gt; resources -- Richard Maxfield&apos;s _Night Music_ used only a tape<br/>&gt; recorder and a high frequency oscillator and some Latin American<br/>&gt; composers have used simple bamboo instruments to simulate synthesized<br/>&gt; sounds. The whole Early Music movement has also demonstrated that<br/>&gt; advances in technology do not necessarily bring improvements in music,<br/>&gt; but rather that particular technologies may often be more appropriate<br/>&gt; to a given music.</p><p>Ok, I can&apos;t knock anyone using using simple resources to achieve vital<br/>music.  I&apos;ve used basic stuff, too, but am delighted to be able to<br/>discard the hissy medium of cassette tapes for the clean medium of<br/>CD quality digital sound!</p><p>Nevertheless, your response is well argued and I find little to quarrel<br/>with.</p><p>[Zhang2323, TD 287.15:]<br/>&gt;&gt;... advances in technology do not necessarily bring improvements in<br/>&gt;&gt; music, but rather that particular technologies may often be more<br/>&gt;&gt; appropriate to a given music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     WHOLE-HEARTED AGREEMENT from me...<br/>&gt;     there is such thing as &quot;Appropriate Technologies&quot;<br/>&gt;     ... ties in with the whole &quot;Small is Beautiful&quot;<br/>&gt;     ethics/ aesthetics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     For example, the only reasons why I seek a synthesizer that is<br/>&gt;     capable of non12TET scales:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     1) to be able to play many different sounds that<br/>&gt;         do not exist or are unwieldy to cart around or<br/>&gt;         to expensive for me to make or have made<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     2) to create wide variety of UNEQUAL Just Intonation<br/>&gt;         scales &amp; to be able to experiment with same w/o<br/>&gt;         too much &quot;techno-obsessive compulsiveness&quot; or<br/>&gt;         &quot;techno-consumerism.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, well I certainly HOPE I&apos;m not guilty of &quot;techno-obsessive<br/>compulsiveness&quot;, but each one of us has to decide how much constitutes<br/>too much.  Any tool can swallow creativity if it becomes the focus.<br/>I&apos;ve been there, done that, with other kinds of &quot;toys&quot;.  But my<br/>experience with computers is that having a fast PC enhances rather than<br/>restricts musical expression.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=4424 href="#4424">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/1999 6:09:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[John ff, TD 290.1:]<br/>&gt; Some of use prefer to use other machines than PCs!
