The<br/> &gt; A-sharp would be a little higher than a B-flat would be, and the F<br/> &gt; natural would be a little lower than an E-sharp would be.  So it was<br/> &gt; really slightly more than a perfect fourth, and for the words &quot;The<br/> &gt; most are gone now,&quot; &quot;gone&quot; would be a little under what you&apos;d expect<br/> &gt; as the interval of a fourth, and would be correspondingly expressive<br/> &gt; in that way.&quot; (Charles Ives Remembered: An Oral History, Da Capo<br/> &gt; Press, p.221) &gt;&gt;</p><p>This has to be taken in context.  Mr. Kirkpatrick was a real believer in the<br/>transcendental; so much so that for him, a common physical world did not<br/>really exist. So when he says &quot;a suggestion of an interval&quot;, this is two<br/>steps removed from the interpretation that I suspect Johnny Reinhard would<br/>like to take from this interview.</p><p>Further, and despite his actual contact with Ives, Mr. Kirkpatrick has to be<br/>heard as a fairly radical reinterpreter of Ives&apos; music.  No one captured it<br/>better than David Tudor, who said: &quot;I heard John Kirckpatrick play the<br/>&apos;Concord Sonata&apos;. It was beautiful: not a note over mezzo-forte.&quot;</p></div>
