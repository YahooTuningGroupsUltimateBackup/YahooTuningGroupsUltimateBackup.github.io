It does<br/>the best job of balancing the major thirds with the minor thirds, and<br/>the major sixths with the minor sixths. All these intervals are only<br/>1/7 comma off from JI. Meanwhile, 1/3-comma meantone has pure major<br/>sixths and minor thirds, and closes nicely after 19 notes. If you<br/>minimize the sum of the squared errors of all the 5-limit consonant<br/>intervals, you get 7/26-comma meantone, which was advocated by<br/>Woolhouse.</p></div><h3><a id=29087 href="#29087">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2001 2:32:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; 26-et<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 26-et makes up for its not very inspiring fifths and thirds by<br/>&gt; being an all-around utility division up to the 17-limit,</p><p>It&apos;s the first ET consistent through the 13-limit, but 17-limit?</p><p>&gt; It also has<br/>&gt; 4/26, with a 9-complexity of 8, and scales 222223222223 of 12 notes<br/>&gt; and 22222212222221 of 14 notes;</p><p>The latter also has an &quot;omnitetrachordal&quot; variant: 22222221222221.<br/>I&apos;ve discussed these scales many times here, including detailed<br/>discussions with Dave Keenan; and they&apos;re mentioned in my paper.

The values for 13 and 17, as I<br/>&gt; remarked, are not as flat as 9, so there isn&apos;t much reason to neglect<br/>&gt; them--the 15, at -695, goes over the magic barrier, and we can see<br/>&gt; that 13 and 17 are quite a lot better.

Good to hear from you again! I posted a reply to this<br/>Friday, but it doesn&apos;t seem to have made it into the list. You&apos;re<br/>more than welcome to &quot;jump in&quot; my friend. I appreciate your<br/>confirmation and Paul&apos;s, the latter of which came after my first<br/>attempt to post.</p><p>With regard to this reply, I have seen the whole meantone scenario<br/>more clearly, and now Paul Erlich&apos;s replies have further confirmed my<br/>conclusions that came after your confirmation, John. I had already<br/>run into Woolhouse at Joe Monz&apos;s site. Quite a guy! Impressed that<br/>Paul had concluded the same via another route. Congratulations, Paul!<br/>You&apos;re both very benignly monsturous wizards in your own way. I have<br/>a great deal of respect for Margo&apos;s and Gene&apos;s contibutions, too,<br/>alhtough I&apos;m not so well-acquainted with the algebraic methods Gene<br/>and Paul are perpetually discussing.

It is very pleasingly close to JI, but<br/>just weirdly different enough from either JI or 12-tET in it&apos;s<br/>melodic/harmonic and structural properties to both charm and<br/>fascinate my little musical brain quite a lot.

I feel the future of music is away from such<br/>compromise and toward a powerful harmonic language or languages that<br/>integrate the whole beautiful thing without demanidng such<br/>compromises.

In my<br/>system, to go from relative to absolute cents you divide by n for an<br/>n-et; using your definition we multiply by 12/n rather than by 1/n.<br/>Mine makes relative and absolute cents the same for the 1-et<br/>(octave), and yours makes them the same for the 12-et.</p><p>Does anyone have an objection to defining relative cents (rc) in an<br/>n-et to be cents * n /12 ? If not, the motion carries.</p></div><h3><a id=29228 href="#29228">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/16/2001 7:54:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_29076.html#29188">/tuning/topicId_29076.html#29188</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;m wondering how easy it would be to use SCALA and what is it?<br/>FTS? or something, just to at least get some kind of funky mechanical<br/>&gt; audio sketch of my ideas in 19-tET.<br/>&gt;</p><p>As the &quot;nutty professor&quot; on the other list suggests... buy a used<br/>TX81Z for $200 and a 5-octave MIDI controller for $150.</p><p>$350.</p><p>Scala is free, and the TX81Z can be wonderfully tuned with it:</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/</a></p><p>Or... if you just want to experiment with the sounds of 19-tET and<br/>every other conceivable tuning...with just your sound card and the<br/>keyboard MIDI controller:</p><p>Use the TOTALLY FREE, Graham Breed MIDI relay... one of the greatest<br/>xenharmonic inventions known to our wonderful breed known as mankind,<br/>for which we (and I) now have such great confidence...:</p><p><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/software.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/software.htm</a></p><p>__________ _______ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=29244 href="#29244">ðŸ”—</a>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>10/17/2001 7:50:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Joe.

I&apos;ve updated the help for the window<br/>(which you get if you click on ? icon at top right) - though there<br/>is a little bit of that still to do for the very newest options<br/>in the section.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
