I&apos;m not certain I could work it out all by myself yet, though...<br/>the water is a little deep at this end...</p><p>However, Paul Erlich promises his &quot;Gentle Guide to Combination Product<br/>Sets&quot; and I eagerly await this article... sounds like the &quot;CPS dummies<br/>guide&quot; at last...</p><p>In the meantime, I have enjoyed the fascinating accounts of the hexany<br/>by Keith Grady, Manuel and Paul Erlich.  The triangular lattices are<br/>particularly effective.</p><p>I can see now why the triangular lattices are considered superior by<br/>some... certainly the visual portrayal of the intervals is more<br/>complete.</p><p>As to the hexany 13 itself... well, it does sound great.  Of course,<br/>it&apos;s related to various orientalisms.  My favorite part of it is the<br/>fact that the TRITONE is the OCTAVE!  That&apos;s just great in my book...<br/>turning the &quot;resolving&quot; interval into the ultimate consonant diad!<br/>Whoopee!</p><p>But then the lattices, and the mandala... hmmm.  The scale sounds like,<br/>somehow, it would be the perfect sound accompaniment to its own visual<br/>lattice representation.  How can we account for that one??  It must be<br/>the Heisenberg principle....<br/>_______________ ________ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=10462 href="#10462">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2000 10:19:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; As to the hexany 13 itself...</p><p>13?</p><p>&gt; well, it does sound great.
