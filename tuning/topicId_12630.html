Pat Metheny has said<br/>&gt; that he&apos;d rather use it for solos instead of his Synclavier...Bill<br/>&gt; Frisell, Fripp, Adrian Belew, and Andy Summers were (are?) users of the<br/>&gt; GR 300 in the past. I think it&apos;s a landmark invention in the guitar<br/>&gt; arsenal...yes, it&apos;s somewhat limited, and I think of it as sort of a hot<br/>&gt; rod fuzztone, but it has many valuable uses, especially for &quot;outside&quot;<br/>&gt; types of music. I have used it extensively for 20 years, and actually<br/>&gt; have 2 of them. It can be used by any guitar, in any tuning...all you<br/>&gt; need is the pickup, which is easily available. It tracks almost<br/>&gt; perfectly, and when you learn how to use the various filters and octave<br/>&gt; settings, you can get some real interesting things happening. I am quite<br/>&gt; surprised that it didn&apos;t catch on more than it did...I used it on 2<br/>&gt; tunes on my &quot;Other Worlds&quot; CD, &quot;The Spider&quot; and &quot;Diggeridon&apos;t.&quot; I would<br/>&gt; like to have all of my guitars fixed with it...Hstick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
