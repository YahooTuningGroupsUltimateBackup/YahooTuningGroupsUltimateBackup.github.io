It is their<br/>&gt; use over a period of time that one tires of them<br/>&gt; ( at least me). If you had to make acoustic instruments<br/>&gt; you use of them would probably shrink. 53 for 5 limit<br/>&gt; music or 72 for more I would consider to use if I had<br/>&gt; to use one. I started with 31 and after a few<br/>&gt; years I just couldn&apos;t stand having a good 9/8</p><p>Didn&apos;t you mean &quot;*not* having a good 9/8&quot; there?</p><p>Kraig, you don&apos;t have to argue the merits of JI<br/>with me - that&apos;s my overall orientation too.</p><p>I agree that constructing acoustic instruments for<br/>many-degreed richly-modulating ETs is a daunting<br/>task - that&apos;s why I&apos;ve never done it!.  I&apos;m all for<br/>using digital technology to acheive proper tuning.</p><p>But by proper, I don&apos;t necessarily mean small-integer<br/>JI.  If that&apos;s the kind of music you *want* to make,<br/>hey, go for it.  I like writing small-integer JI stuff<br/>too.  And I liked the five points you made about why<br/>JI composers use JI.</p><p>But my point (and Stearns too, I think - hard to<br/>tell thru all the &quot;baloney&quot;) was that some of<br/>us *dont&apos;t want* to limit ourselves to composing<br/>within that (or any other) particular intonational<br/>limitation.</p><p>As Partch said (I&apos;m paraphrasing): &quot;to be chained by<br/>self-imposed limitations is a legitimate exercise<br/>of one&apos;s personal freedom, but to be chained by<br/>limitations imposed from outside is a horse of another<br/>color&quot;.  Partch was using that as an argument against<br/>the hegemony of 12-Eq, but it certainly applies in<br/>the other direction too.</p><p>I will always prefer to write and think in JI,<br/>because it gives me a richness of numerical<br/>possibility that&apos;s totally lacking from *any*<br/>reasonably-sized ET.  But I still write in ETs<br/>if I&apos;m inspired and that&apos;s the instrument I happen<br/>to have around.</p><p>Equal temperament provides a way of thinking about<br/>pitch-division that&apos;s entirely different from JI.<br/>Then there are other, more unusual tunings too,<br/>like meantone, well-temperament, Carlos scales,<br/>13th root of pi, etc. etc. etc.</p><p>Each one has its own unique contribution to make<br/>to music.</p><p>- Monzo</p><p> |\=/|.-&quot;&quot;&quot;-.
