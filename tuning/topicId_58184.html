It would be a convenience for medieval music or anything which<br/>&gt;&gt;for any reason someone wanted to tune to Pythagorean tuning, which 53<br/>&gt;&gt;comes very close to.<br/>&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I agree. I always wondered there was a 41-Pyth but not a 53-Pyth. (They &gt;should add a 29-Pyth as well.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;~Danny~ &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=58209 href="#58209">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher John Smith &#x3C;christopherjohn_smith@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2005 9:36:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message: 12<br/>   Date: Sat, 23 Apr 2005 23:25:26 -0000<br/>   From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@tonalsoft.com">monz@tonalsoft.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Digest Number 3488</p><p>hi monz, thank you for your reply -</p><p>&gt;&gt; My own trifling bit of<br/>&gt;&gt; information to contribute<br/>&gt;&gt; is: in the 1st ed. of<br/>&gt;&gt; New Grove (1980), in the<br/>&gt;&gt; article on horn there is a<br/>&gt;&gt; page reproduced from the<br/>&gt;&gt; last published manual for<br/>&gt;&gt; natural horn, c. 1850, which<br/>&gt;&gt; is a chart showing which<br/>&gt;&gt; notes are stopped/closed,<br/>&gt;&gt; and it gives different<br/>&gt;&gt; fractional amounts of<br/>&gt;&gt; hand-closing for enharmonic<br/>&gt;&gt; notes.</p><p>&gt;wow, i would like to get my paws on that manual!</p><p>It&apos;s there in Grove if you know any library that has the 1980 ed., I&apos;m sure they give a reference for the manual.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I also once saw a late-19th/early-20th c. trombone method<br/>&gt;&gt; with a chart giving different fractional slide positions<br/>&gt;&gt; for enharmonics.</p><p>&gt;and that one too!</p><p>I just happened to glance at it when I worked in a music store that dealt in antiquarian material, unfortunately I don&apos;t remember the author or any other information :(<br/>I&apos;m pretty sure it was European, it might possibly have been French, if not then English (i.e. I&apos;m pretty sure it wasn&apos;t German, Italian, etc.) That might narrow it down somewhat if you ever want to undertake some bibliographical research :)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Related to this, I was recently listening to the Bruckner 7th,<br/>&gt;&gt; and there are spots, up to a couple bars at a time or so,<br/>&gt;&gt; where different orchestra sections are notated in different<br/>&gt;&gt; keys, e.g. the brass will be doubling the strings, and the<br/>&gt;&gt; strings are notated in a sharp key and the brass in a flat key.<br/>&gt;&gt; ??</p><p>&gt;hmm ... as soon as i read that, i thought i recalled seeing<br/>&gt;it too ... but i&apos;ve just thumbed thru the whole score of<br/>&gt;Bruckner&apos;s 7th, and don&apos;t see it. can you cite movement<br/>&gt;and measure numbers? ... and in the case of Bruckner, we<br/>&gt;probably need to know which version/publisher it is too.</p><p>It&apos;s the Dover reprint of the Haas edition..some spots are: Ist movement, measures 201-203,  brass have B-flat dominant, E-flat dominant, F-flat while the strings have A-sharp, D-sharp, E; Ist mvt. m. 290-301 horn 1 has flats throughout while the rest of the orchestra is in sharps; IInd mvt. m. 23-24 horns are in E-flat (sounding A-flat) while strings are in G-sharp; II m. 184 strings &amp; ww cadence in D-flat and brass enter in C-sharp.</p><p>BTW, when I first started listening to Mahler, I especially liked the major-minor clashes, which my extremely eccentric teenaged mind thought of as a sort of incipient microtonality (something about the same tone having different inflections, don&apos;t ask for a more logical explanation than that). Maybe I intuited more than I realized..</p><p>Also I heard the Jongen Symphonie Concertante for the first time today, also my first exposure to the Disney Hall organ...my head is reeling with the sound of French (well, Belgian) dominant-sharp-fifth chords..</p><p>Chris</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?
