Shostakovich&apos;s 10th, 11th and 13th symphonies, plus quite a few of<br/>his string quartets are the first things that pop into my mind :-). Hell,<br/>how about *everything* he wrote after Stalin died in 1953??</p><p>&gt; Finally, of course, I had to answer something, and said George Crumb&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Ancient Voices of Children.&quot;  He seemed to waver...just a little<br/>&gt; bit, before<br/>&gt; giving that piece lip service and rounding up the wagons of his earlier<br/>&gt; argument.  Gee, why would anyone want to be a composer after that?</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with the piece or the composer, so I won&apos;t comment on its<br/>comparability to Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. There are quite a few great<br/>composers that I don&apos;t listen to very much, and Brahms happens to be one of<br/>them. So in that respect, Crumb and Brahms are comparable :-).</p><p>&gt; In 2000 we now see college and universities canceling their composition<br/>&gt; departments.  Tenure positions have been taken away from composition<br/>&gt; everywhere.  There has been an attach on ALL serious (but not<br/>&gt; entertaining<br/>&gt; enough) new music.  In fact the pop world emphasizes lyrics in<br/>&gt; 99.99 of its<br/>&gt; music, while the video craze of MTV failed to continue any small<br/>&gt; successes<br/>&gt; they previously experienced.</p><p>The situation is quite a bit brighter here in Oregon. One of the local new<br/>music groups, Fear No Music, runs a young composers&apos; project for young<br/>composers in the 6th through 12th grades. At least one graduate of the<br/>program, Ryan Francis, has gone on to study composition (at Michigan, I<br/>think). I&apos;ve heard some of his works for piano, and he reminded me of<br/>Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Gershwin. I wouldn&apos;t predict the extinction of<br/>the classical composer just yet, at least not in *my* neighborhood.</p><p>&gt; My own music cannot be denuded of its microtones.  I understand that not<br/>&gt; everyone has heard it.  It&apos;s also too difficult for theorists to analyze<br/>&gt; easily (as if they were running to do so), and to challenging to review<br/>&gt; (after all, critics are journalists first and want to appear on<br/>&gt; sure ground<br/>&gt; when reviewing).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are other great microtonal works and non-microtonal works.<br/>&gt;  Since all<br/>&gt; music must be seen from the culture that produces it (even if it is the<br/>&gt; lonely culture on an expatriate individual) it is likely that except for<br/>&gt; pabulum designed for money making, our great diversity and<br/>&gt; complexity make<br/>&gt; for a less reliable distribution of important music, the kind<br/>&gt; that Jon Szanto<br/>&gt; would like to hear.  Remember, he can only here tapes, CDs, etc., not the<br/>&gt; corporeal live performances that we have here in New York.</p><p>Yes, there is probably more microtonality in New York than here in PDX.<br/>:-( I can certainly *make* microtonal music; whether it will be any good is<br/>hard to say. We do tend to support our locals here, but if you and some of<br/>your fellow New York microtonalists ever get a hankerin&apos; to mosey out West,<br/>I reckon I can hitch you up with local folk.<br/>--<br/>M.
