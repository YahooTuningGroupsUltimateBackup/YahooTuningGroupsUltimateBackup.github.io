If that&apos;s<br/>where you are going to stay, I hope it gives you utter bliss to chance that<br/>dream to where it takes you! If you are utterly convinced you are right, far<br/>be it for me to take that muse away. I also hope that you would open up and<br/>explore other possibilities and not shut the door and some potent creative<br/>exploration, because your own work shows just how capable you are at<br/>exploring! Absolutism is the death of Art. But I guess sometimes, it gives<br/>birth to art, in terms of an artist chasing a single theme or muse. (Maybe<br/>the statement &apos;Absolutism is the death of Art&apos; is too absolute, and I just<br/>killed Art) ;) Who knows?! I don&apos;t always live comfortable with ambiguity,<br/>but I know that my creative self depends on it, at least somewhat. My wife is<br/>fond of quoting Rilke: &quot;Live the questions&quot;</p><p>....But it&apos;s just your opinion that Neidhardt I, for example, doesn&apos;t work for<br/>Bach. Hogwash. As if Bach&apos;s music were that fragile. I think it&apos;s positively<br/>radiant in it, as it is in most any temperament, because Bach&apos;s music really<br/>is not so dependant on tuning in the same way that say, William Byrd is, as<br/>much as you would like to argue that it is: it might bring out certain<br/>special features, etc., but it&apos;s not going to lose it&apos;s essential beauty.<br/>(Whereas Byrd&apos;s music just might) People have been listening to and loving<br/>Bach for years in 12-equal, after all.</p><p>(BTW, I&apos;m a fan of many, many, many pieces of 12-equal music. I&apos;m here, like<br/>most of you, to explore other possibilities, not to denegrate 12-equal.<br/>Worshipping Werck-III for Bach to the exculsion of others seems as odd to me<br/>as worshipping 12-equal to the exclusion of others)</p><p>But, this is just *my* opinion at the end of the day.

Bach, his oldest son.  Telemann was<br/>the sixth comma meantone balance to the use of 12unET of Bach.</p><p>Telemann was W.F.&apos;s godfather.  And W.F. would work in Halle and Dresden<br/>(Quantz&apos;s origin) were ensconsed in meantone tuning.</p><p>They two tunings sort of mirror each other, fascinating because Werckmeister<br/>spoke only of the quarter comma variant of meantone and never the later<br/>prominent sixth comma.  Below is from a book I am writing:</p><p>    It is to J. Murray Barbour to explain that the falsities of modern<br/>conclusions about which keys sound better or worse cannot be based on sustained<br/>harmonies as pertains to Bach.  For, &ldquo;except at a final cadence, Bach usually<br/>avoids sustained triads.  Even subsidiary cadences are often arpeggiated or<br/>contain suspensions or other dissonances&rdquo; (Barbour, Bach, p. 81).</p><p>Barbour hammers home the conclusion that well temperament is evident for all<br/>organ works using the most conservative of those as prime evidence.  &ldquo;Even in<br/>the Orgelb&uuml;chlein, which contains the highest proportion of Bach organ works<br/>with simple compass, the latter are far outweighed by others which could be<br/>sharply dissonant in meantone tunings.&rdquo;  Barbour measured the compass of Bach&rsquo;s<br/>organ works as a whole to be Ebb-Cx for a total of 25 degrees (Barbour, Bach,<br/>p. 84).</p><p>These organ works are pedagogical, written for his son while living in<br/>Anhalt-Cothen, to develop as a Dresden and Halle organist, likely in meantone.<br/>Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz (1585-1672) referenced Dresden, Merseburg, and Halle as cities<br/>that had adopted his Psalter, wherein listeners like to follow along the texts in<br/>their psalm-books, and even sing along by ear.  This is a meantone-based<br/>population, unworried about lost chromaticism.  Praetorius worked in Dresden and<br/>Madgeburg (the city ravished by the 30 Years War and birthplace of<br/>meantone-based Telemann).  Was not Halle birthplace and home to Handel, possessor of a<br/>subsemitonium organ keyboard?  Wilhelm Friedemann Bach worked almost exclusively<br/>in the meantone cities of Dresden, Merseburg, and Halle.  Friedemann studied<br/>at 15 with Graun in Merseburg.  Perhaps this is why his father utilized so many<br/>organ works in the Orgelb&uuml;chlein reduced to the meantone compass of notes<br/>(e.g., Eb-G#).</p><p>As we turn to the organ literature, we find that of the 148 works examined,<br/>only 15 lie completely within the E flat to G sharp compass, 12 of these being<br/>chorale preludes in the Orgelb&uuml;chlein.  Only one in ten would be playable on<br/>the conventionally tuned organ, or only one in thirty-four if we exclude the<br/>Orgelb&uuml;chlein!  This is an astounding result, not wholly unexpected to an<br/>organist who is familiar with the entire Bach literature, but still remarkable in<br/>the observed ratio (Barbour, Bach, p. 81).</p></div><h3><a id=59712 href="#59712">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2005 11:01:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m now considering on a temperament very close to 12-ET, but using<br/>an equal<br/>&gt; beating augmented triad skeleton, and breaking those into 4 equal<br/>beating<br/>&gt; 5ths....This gets out of &apos;well-temperament&apos; territory, but has<br/>interesting<br/>&gt; shimmer and resonance properties which are subtely more attractive than<br/>&gt; 12-equal, even though the audible result is almost indistinguishable<br/>from<br/>&gt; 12-equal.</p><p>You might be interested in the Wendell well temperaments:</p><p>! wendell1.scl<br/>!<br/>Robert Wendell&apos;s Natural Synchronous well-temperament (2003)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 94.16800<br/> 198.17100<br/> 298.07800<br/> 393.68000<br/> 4/3<br/> 597.59000<br/> 699.49200<br/> 796.12300<br/> 895.75700<br/> 1000.03300<br/> 1095.63500<br/> 2/1</p><p>! wendell2.scl<br/>!<br/>Robert Wendell&apos;s Very Mild Synchronous well-temperament (2003)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 94.93100<br/> 198.79700<br/> 298.84100<br/> 394.11360<br/> 498.44500<br/> 598.02400<br/> 700.05800<br/> 796.88600<br/> 895.75900<br/> 1000.79600<br/> 1096.06900<br/> 2/1</p></div><h3><a id=59714 href="#59714">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2005 11:04:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; ...

This was done for two reasons:</p><p>1) To reduce the error in the dominant triads in the keys of D, A,<br/>and E minor;<br/>2) To avoid intonation significantly worse than 12-ET for any of the<br/>8 usable triads of the Eb-to-G# meantone tuning.</p><p>I spent a lot of time back in &apos;75 testing and fine-tuning my #2 and<br/>#3 temperaments by ear on my Scalatron, making instantaneous back-and-<br/>forth comparisons between slightly different versions of each, so I<br/>went quite bit beyond evaluating the numbers.

Doesn&apos;t work, plain and simple -- and<br/>&gt; &gt; WTC I most definitely has pieces in Db-major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously. Gene has done so much work in this area that,<br/>&gt; if I were Gene, I&apos;d probably find this remark to be an<br/>&gt; insult to my intelligence.</p><p>Sheesh, Paul ... please, lighten up. I&apos;m just putting<br/>in my 2 cents, and not trying to criticize anyone else&apos;s<br/>work or intelligence. Anyway ...</p><p>&gt; But I&apos;d also try to smile about it :)</p><p>OK, that&apos;s better.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now, admittedly, a milder version of meantone wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; be as bad ... but for the stronger versions, forget it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, why did you choose to interpret Gene&apos;s remark as<br/>&gt; implying a 1/4-meantone chain-of-5ths tuned from Eb to G#,<br/>&gt; when you yourself have primarily interpreted and<br/>&gt; implemented meantone in a more general and flexible manner?</p><p>I should have written more in my post. It just so<br/>happens that one of my adult students has had his piano<br/>tuned in 1/4-comma meantone for a few months, and at<br/>his lesson yesterday i was talking about the last<br/>movement of Mahler&apos;s 9th Symphony, which is in Db-major,<br/>and i tried to play the opening of it for him ... but<br/>of course, on his piano, as soon as i play the first<br/>Db chord it sounded horrible.</p><p>:-)</p><p>The moral of the story is: i should just stay out of<br/>discussions on this list if i&apos;m not in a &quot;tuning list<br/>addiction&quot; phase.

Bach&apos;s music, unlike Beethoven&apos;s,<br/>doesn&apos;t appear to make use of the ability to go all the way around<br/>the circle of 12 fifths (or any equivalent enharmonic modulation) in<br/>a single piece, though. While a circulating well-temperament was<br/>certainly essential to render most of Bach&apos;s music on a 12-note<br/>keyboard, I don&apos;t think any of it is impossible in a sufficiently<br/>extended meantone -- while Beethoven&apos;s certainly is (unless you&apos;re<br/>happy with the Appassionata starting in F minor and ending in a key<br/>of Abbbb minor! :))</p><p>&gt; Or if we venture out to the inventions/sinfonias:</p><p>This was *only* intended to apply to WTC I, nothing else.</p><p>&gt; the E major<br/>&gt; invention has 13 notes from D to Cx.

The F minor sinfonia has 15, from<br/>Bbb-<br/>&gt; Fb up to A-E-B.</p><p>I think all of these would be possible in extended meantone, with<br/>enough pitches per octave to distinguish all these notes. The exact<br/>equivalence of what we call &quot;enharmonic equivalents&quot; today would have<br/>been a practical necessity on 12-note keyboards, but wasn&apos;t a<br/>*musical* necessity until abour the time of Beethoven.</p><p>&gt; And the first Duetto (BWV 802) makes a virtue of shifting<br/>enharmonics<br/>&gt; within its main theme, smacking us in the face variously with A#-<br/>Bb,<br/>&gt; E#-F, C#-Db, and G#-Ab as the piece goes along.

One other nifty piece of Bach&apos;s not to neglect: the modulation<br/>canon of the Musical Offering.  Each time it&apos;s played it has the<br/>canonic theme enter in two different minor keys, moving up the spiral<br/>of 5ths.  If we play it merely six times, i.e. using 12 different<br/>minor scales along the way, we&apos;ve already moved from the beginning C<br/>minor all the way up to B# minor; and it can keep going as long as we<br/>like.</p><p>Arguably, there should also be some steady progression of character--<br/>something smooth rather than jumpy, if there&apos;s a change at all--from<br/>each minor scale to the next as its tonic moves up the spiral of 5ths<br/>to the next position.  [If there&apos;s variety, gentle/smooth variety<br/>with some logical flow to it; or if there&apos;s no variety, why bother<br/>modulating at all?]</p><p>Given that each scale shares most of its notes with the next one, the<br/>simplest way to make a gradual and logical change is to have the new<br/>note that&apos;s coming in be slightly more pure or impure than the one<br/>that is dropping out of the set.  Pure/impure in the context of the<br/>remaining six notes, melodically....  It&apos;s all relative proportions<br/>on this rotating thingy where we can lay down a tonic, and then see<br/>where the other six notes of the diatonic scale are vis-a-vis the<br/>slope of their positions in a *regular* (&quot;meantone&quot;) generation of<br/>the notes.
