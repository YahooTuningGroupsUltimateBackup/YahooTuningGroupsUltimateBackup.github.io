I&apos;m way out of my league here -<br/>&gt;how about some of you physics professors<br/>&gt;explaining whether or not I&apos;m on the right<br/>&gt;track?</p><p>I&apos;ll gratefully yield to any real professors out there.  I think, though,<br/>that you are on the right track.  It&apos;s something I have thought about<br/>before.</p><p>The first idea would be to specify a ratio in coordinates or whatever, and<br/>also specify it&apos;s uncertainty in cents or whatever.  So, instead of &quot;play a<br/>3/2&quot; say &quot;play within 3 cents of a 3/2&quot;.  Or even, say &quot;play 3 cents flat of<br/>3/2&quot; but in a way a computer would understand.  Here, the &quot;error&quot; would be<br/>an extra column in the matrix.  See<br/><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/matrices.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/matrices.htm</a> for what a matrix is in this<br/>context.</p><p>The other idea is to express the probability that a given interval will<br/>represent a given ratio.  So, 400 cents could be 60% a 5/4, 30% an 81/64 and<br/>10% a 9/7.  These figures are only examples.  All sorts of algorithms could<br/>be defined to score ratios according to nearness and simplicity.  I think<br/>this could be useful for adaptive tuning as well.  You could take all the<br/>different just interpretations of the new note, and score each according to<br/>how consonant the resulting chords are, by whatever method you use.  Then,<br/>each value will have a probability assigned to it.  The note assigned can be<br/>either the most probable, or a sort of quantum superposition of them all.</p><p>In the example given, the pitch would be 13.7*0.6 - 7.8*0.3 - 35.1*0.1 =<br/>2.37 cents flat of equal temperament.  A more useful algorithm would score<br/>simplicity much higher than nearness, and so give something very close to<br/>5/4.   The idea of averaging rather than taking the highest is so that<br/>&quot;ambiguous&quot; notes like the D in C major can end up being tempered.</p><p>I am interested in getting my MIDI Relay program working with adaptive<br/>tunings.  One reason it doesn&apos;t yet is that I&apos;m finding myself doing things<br/>in fixed tunings that a dynamic algorithm would stomp all over.  I&apos;ll be<br/>glad to assist anyone working on this sort of thing.  I can explain how to<br/>get MIDI working in Windows if nothing else.</p><p>      Graham</p><p>p.s. This weeks New Scientist says that the uncertainty principle in QM may<br/>all have been a big mistake!</p></div>
