The minor seventh at 968 cents, by<br/>comparison, is less than 1 cent narrow of 7:4, so Gary&apos;s own description<br/>of this tuning as close to 7:4^1/11 may be a very apt one.&quot;</p><p>By the way, for people looking for a nonoctave scale with an<br/>&quot;octave-like&quot; interval, 7:4^1/88 is almost identical to 109-tET, or<br/>vice versa.</p><p>As mentioned in this thread, the Bohlen-Pierce &quot;tritave&quot; or 3:1 scale<br/>in either its just or tempered versions is a great scale that might<br/>attract people to a xenharmonic point of view, especially in the kind<br/>of timbres suggested with an emphasis on odd partials. Maybe this<br/>would serve as a fine example not only of new approaches to scale<br/>construction, but also to the Setharian theme of timbre and<br/>consonance.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
