In other words, the<br/>&gt; different harmonics are simply going up and down in amplitude.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Isn&apos;t that some form of &apos;chorusing&apos;?</p><p>A sine wave with periodic amplitude modulation is of course equivalent<br/>to two sine waves with slightly different frequencies. So what we have<br/>is, instead of a harmonic series, a set of partials going two by two<br/>around the frequency where each harmonic &apos;should&apos; be. The exact<br/>frequency content depends on whether all the would-be harmonics are<br/>being &apos;phased&apos; at the same rate or at different rates.</p><p>In any case, the result is not a harmonic tone - it is maybe not even<br/>as good as an approximation to a harmonic tone as (say) middle C on a<br/>grand piano, and certainly not as good as a sustained note sung senza<br/>vibrato.</p><p>&gt; This is on purpose, for several reasons: it&apos;s more &quot;organic&quot;,<br/>&gt; softer, and no particular partial dominates the timbre. Also I would<br/>&gt; like people to concentrate on the overall picture- with dead<br/>&gt; straight rock steady tones I think it tends to become a test for<br/>&gt; listening only to beats, besides being very annoying.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I find this &apos;overall picture&apos; just confusing, myself. If I were tuning<br/>an instrument (say a reed organ) I would think to myself, that first<br/>note is a mistuned unison, and I can&apos;t possibly hear any kind of<br/>tempered fifth above it because it&apos;s not clean enough.</p><p>I grant that in many musical contexts a certain amount of &apos;chorusing&apos;<br/>is inevitable and not in any way detrimental. But it is precisely in<br/>those contexts that a small amount of tempering is undetectable and<br/>irrelevant, because the chorusing obliterates the difference between<br/>pure and tempered intervals.</p><p>Returning to harmonic tones, if you want to make hearing tempered<br/>intervals more than a matter of detecting the textbook lowest beat<br/>frequency, you can use complicated timbres - for example if the<br/>fundamental is weak and certain upper partials dominate; or you can<br/>try to model a real instrument by having an &apos;envelope&apos; which gives<br/>different partial content at different pitches... etc.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=68760 href="#68760">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2007 6:59:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is just very mild PWM of pulses with slow sines (heavy modulation<br/>with a triangle does create a detuned &quot;ghost&quot;), and a LPF.

I said, it&apos;s not a test,<br/>just say which one you prefer. She prefered the first because the<br/>second is &quot;a little nervous&quot;, and immediately added &quot;depends what<br/>you want in the music&quot;. She did not find the test esoteric or<br/>difficult, and made some interesting comments- it&apos;s what we do every<br/>day making music (hearing and using different sound characters), for<br/>example, sometimes she&apos;ll sing false, even quite a bit, and be happy<br/>because it sounds great and makes an energy.</p><p>To be more precise, where I translated &quot;even quite a bit false&quot;, she<br/>actually said &quot;quarter tone false&quot; (&egrave;trt tona favÂš), but I know from<br/>having sung in a Balkan folk music group with her that that&apos;s her<br/>term for a region from a few cents out to an eighth-tone; an<br/>official &quot;quarter tone&quot; is more a kind of concrete half-step in her<br/>book. On a side note, she found my 23-limit 17-tone tuning beautiful<br/>and natural, &quot;that&apos;s how you sing anyway&quot;.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s just a tiny test, but with ten years of plodding along<br/>with different &quot;tests&quot; we&apos;ll surely have something.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
