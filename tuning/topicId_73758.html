I&apos;ve yet to have my own Linux computer, but<br/>as soon as i buy my new laptop, that&apos;s what&apos;s going to<br/>happen to my old one.</p><p>I just wanted to mention this: we originally planned on<br/>making early versions of Tonescape a sort of overlay on<br/>top of Csound.</p><p>The current version of Tonescape, &quot;Den Haag&quot;, does allow<br/>output of Tonescape scores as  Csound .csd (unified .orc<br/>and .sco) files under one limited circumstance: we<br/>created one Csound instrument, the one for Tonescape&apos;s<br/>&quot;Guitar [Classical]&quot;; no further work has been done on<br/>creating our own Csound instruments since early 2006.</p><p>So if you want to compose for synthesized acoustic guitar,<br/>then Tonescape will do it all for you and export the<br/>Tonescape file to Csound.</p><p>If you want to compose in Tonescape for other instruments,<br/>and you have your own Csound instruments in an .orc file,<br/>you can still use Tonescape to easily create the .sco part<br/>in whatever tuning you wish. After you&apos;ve saved the Tonescape<br/>file with the instruments you want, change the instrument<br/>for all parts to &quot;Guitar [Classical]&quot;, and export to .csd.<br/>Then open the .csd file in an editor, delete the part<br/>between the &quot;&lt;CsInstruments&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;&quot; tags,<br/>and insert your own .sco file there.</p><p>We also have a couple of pages on our website explaining<br/>Csound opcodes and gen routines:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/pub/pitch-bend/pitch.2005-10-03.17-00.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/pub/pitch-bend/pitch.2005-10-03.17-00.aspx</a></p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/pub/pitch-bend/pitch.2005-10-03.17-01.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/pub/pitch-bend/pitch.2005-10-03.17-01.aspx</a></p><p>(you can access these from our main page by following<br/>the menus &quot;Info | News Archives | The Pitch Bend&quot;.)</p><p>Nothing earth-shaking there: they&apos;re just a reformatted<br/>version of what&apos;s available on the regular Csound pages.<br/>But i think they look nicer and are easier to read.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2007 4:33:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brian Redfern&quot; &lt;brianwredfern@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey guys, I recently wrote this article on tuning csound, I go<br/>over how<br/>&gt; standard tuning works, and then how to use a csound table to setup<br/>your own<br/>&gt; custom tuning, in this case one of my Kraig Grady favorites, the<br/>14 tone<br/>&gt; tuning that comes with the Scala collection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It also covers how to control csound in realtime with midi, so<br/>here it is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mstation.org/realtime_csound.php">http://mstation.org/realtime_csound.php</a></p><p>Thanks for posting this, very nice!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I actually do acoustic music as well, I&apos;m working on some classical<br/>&gt; compositions for fretless nylon string solo guitar.</p><p>I don&apos;t know anyone who does serious electronic work who is not  an<br/>acoustic musician, though I imagine there must be people<br/>with a special abstract gift for electronic alone.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
