Chris had the machine tuned so that each rank of<br/>buttons was tuned to a diatonic approximation, and the ranks above and beneath were transposed a<br/>2^1/53 (don&apos;t remember exactly, but this seems right) so you could play piano-like chords on any<br/>rank and choose from among the other pitches by grabbing notes from other ranks.
