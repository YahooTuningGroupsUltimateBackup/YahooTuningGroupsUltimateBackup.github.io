I have downloaded SCALA and am suspecting that I can<br/>use it to generate actual scales that I can play with to build midi<br/>files I can hear.

I have myriad microtonal ideas floating around<br/>in my head at this point that I would like to turn into sound for<br/>feedback and further experimentation!</p><p>Can anyone help me?

Although I&apos;m in the rural midwest, this touches<br/>everyone. I have a good friend from my home town who lives in New<br/>York and don&apos;t know how he is yet. It&apos;s unlikely he was there, but<br/>his job could have easily taken him to the WTC at any time. He was<br/>supposed to visit here this weekend, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going<br/>to happen now.</p><p>Many people here have friends and/or relatives in the NY area and<br/>some are naturally quite concerned. So you can feel the weight of<br/>this in the air quite strongly even here. Clearly the previously<br/>pervasive U.S. mindset that such things only happen overseas has been<br/>very effectively erased.</p><p>Thank you also, Manuel, for your quick response on the request for<br/>help with SCALA. Very much appreciated!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still shocked by yesterday&apos;s events, I wish strength to<br/>&gt; everybody involved in the drama.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob, Scala&apos;s main feature it to transfer a scale to the<br/>&gt; tuning table of a synthesizer or sampler.
