Do you really think that their musical uniqueness (assuming they have any, pardon my ignorance) *depends* on these large primes. Or might it be that it was merely convenient to express the scales using these numbers. Maybe logarithms had&apos;t been invented?</p><p>&gt;Another idea I discuss is my<br/>&gt;belief that 13 can be (and has been)<br/>&gt;viewed as a kind of limit in harmonic<br/>&gt;usage, with higher primes generally being<br/>&gt;used as alternate choices for the lower<br/>&gt;primes nearby - for example, 17 and 19<br/>&gt;are both usually used instead of, and<br/>&gt;not together with, 9 or each other; 15 is<br/>&gt;generally used instead of, and not together<br/>&gt;with, 7.</p><p>Ah, yes. This certainly accords with my beliefs. So in a sense, this says to me, for example, that 9/8 can usually be substituted for 17/15 or 19/17 (about 9 cents away). But I am willing to leave the limit at 19 (pending Kraig Grady&apos;s response re 23) and say for example that 11/10 can be substituted for 21/19 or 23/21 (about 8c away). Note that around middle C such a deviation corresponds to about a 1 Hz beat, which one would not expect to notice unless the chord were sustained for more than a second (and there was no deliberate vibrato etc. etc.).</p><p>So I think that it is more meaningful in most contexts to refer to a 21/19 as &quot;11/10 +8c&quot; or &quot;10/9 -9c&quot;.</p><p>In another thread there was discussion of whether something was a 45/32. Now this may be significant in its relationship with other notes of the scale but when played with the 1/1 it is surely more significant that this is 7/5 +7.7c.</p><p>Maybe there&apos;s an ideological/political issue here. If I may be permitted a caricature: &quot;A true JI-ist must never talk in cents or admit that anything is &apos;a usable approximation&apos; of anything else. JI is ratios, zero beats, and that&apos;s that!&quot;</p><p>I believe that such a position would fly in the face of the facts.</p><p>I understand there is a kind of &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; built into Fourier (or Laplace or wavelet) analysis and presumably also into whatever the ear+brain does. You can&apos;t give a definite frequency to any wave that you only sample for a finite duration. The shorter it lasts, the greater the uncertainty in its frequency. delta_f = 1/delta_t. So if a chord only lasts for a second it&apos;s impossible to say whether it had zero beats. It might have had a beat slower than one per second and you wouldn&apos;t (couldn&apos;t?) notice it.</p><p>For example, Jazz appears to me to use 12-tET as if it were approximating ratios of 7 (among others). 12-tET is very poor at this (up to 31 cent errors) but long sustained chords are notably absent from Jazz, so it &quot;works&quot;. I&apos;m sure people can train themselves to recognise more complex ratios, but there will still be some limit on the complexity, and I see no way around requiring a longer time to do the recognition.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=1052 href="#1052">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/1999 12:08:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote [TD 54]:</p><p>&gt; Maybe there&apos;s an ideological/political issue<br/>&gt; here.

That fact is that no matter<br/>how complex and accurate you wish to<br/>make your JI model (i.e., lattice diagram),<br/>there are perceptual and conceptual<br/>limits built into our physiology that make<br/>it necessary to reduce the complexity<br/>of the model in order for it to more accurately<br/>represent what is really going on when<br/>we listen to and anyalyze musical intervals,<br/>scales, harmonies, etc.  This is indeed<br/>an &quot;uncertainty principle&quot;, exactly related<br/>to the one defined in quantum mechanics.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said, I&apos;m not all that familiar with<br/>Fokker&apos;s work, but he apparently formalized<br/>this idea already.  It also plays an important<br/>part in Erv Wilson&apos;s ideas.</p><p>In terms of my concepts of &quot;finity&quot; and<br/>&quot;bridging&quot;, I&apos;d like to recap a discussion I<br/>had with Paul Erlich regarding Fokker<br/>Determinants (Paul can give a better<br/>mathematical description of what these<br/>are - I&apos;ll just give the results of our discussion):</p><p>Given a set of independent xenharmonic<br/>bridges, the Fokker Determinant is the operation<br/>which specifies the number of distinct elements<br/>which constitute the finity of the system.</p><p>Each bridge reduces the dimensions of<br/>the conceptual model (i.e., lattice diagram)<br/>by one, and the final bridge closes the<br/>theoretically infinite system of the model,<br/>to make it finite.</p><p>As examples:</p><p>- to reduce an infinite 3-limit JI system to<br/>  a finite one, you need one bridge.  This<br/>  is most commonly the Pythagorean Comma,<br/>  leaving a closed 12-EQ system.  Another<br/>  commonly used bridge is the Mercator<br/>  Comma, leaving a closed  53-EQ system.</p><p>- to reduce an infinite 5-limit system to a<br/>  finite one, you need 2 bridges.  The first<br/>  one bridges the syntonic comma, reducing<br/>  the 5-limit system to a 3-limit one, and the<br/>  second bridge acts as the ones described<br/>  above</p><p>- similarly, a 7-limit system requires 3 bridges<br/>  to become a closed system, an 11-limit requires<br/> 4, and so on.</p><p>An important point is that the resulting closed<br/>systems do not have to be equal temperaments.<br/>They can also be finite JI systems.</p><p>The determinant of a matrix (or lattice diagram)<br/>is the area of the parallelogram bounded by the<br/>bridging vectors making up the matrix.  Therefore<br/>the determinant is the number of lattice points in<br/>the finite system.</p><p>- Monzo (with help from Erlich)<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=1408 href="#1408">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/1999 2:11:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There was a post that I had wanted to<br/>respond to, but forgotten.

He was just trying to achieve<br/>as closely as possible a geometrically equal<br/>division.</p><p>I&apos;ll explain briefly, using only one<br/>tetrachord, and I&apos;ll just call the notes<br/>1, 2, 3, 4 (and their modifications in<br/>letter-names), from highest to lowest.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit complicated, because some<br/>notes were moveable and some were fixed<br/>(that&apos;s how ancient Greek theory worked).</p><p>Technically, 1 and 4 (the bounding notes<br/>of the tetrachord) were fixed, and the<br/>two inner notes (2 and 3) were moveable,<br/>depending on the genera, which was either<br/>Diatonic, Chromatic, or Enharmonic.</p><p>The difference was based on characteristic<br/>intervals withing the tetrachord,<br/>illustrated below in fractional (i.e.,<br/>logarithmic) parts of a tone.</p><p>Without logarithmic measurement, ancient<br/>rational tunings only approximate these<br/>intervals, but Boethius came remarkably<br/>close to them.  Thus, his Enharmonic<br/>2nd note is exactly the same as his<br/>Diatonic and Chromatic 3rd note (in many<br/>other theorists it was different).</p><p>Here&apos;s a rough diagram of the intervals,<br/>actually quite similar to the one in the<br/>manuscripts of his book, but with the<br/>monochord bridges labelled simply with<br/>numbers and letters (rather than the<br/>long Greek names).</p><p>The numbers are equivalent to the Greek<br/>use of names, and the letters correspond<br/>to our music notes, descending in pitch<br/>from E to B.
