So, I have also done it so that you can choose any of the centisteps<br/>notations, and decide to use it as ones default, or cents notation.</p><p>I have a tick box &quot;Set this notation as cents&quot;. Defaults of course to 1200 cents per octave,<br/>but you can change the notation, and then tick it for one of the other centisteps<br/>notations instead.</p><p>Then, you can enter the values in the ordinary decimal point type fashion as for SCALA<br/>cents, but now it will mean 1700 cents per octave or whatever. Doing it this way<br/>avoids any possibility of confusion about what a value means when you enter it<br/>into the scale definitions.</p><p>It is interesting about the a to g in 17-centisteps notation.<br/>The a00 is the fifth of the scale, so it corresponds to a<br/>seven equal division of the &quot;fourth&quot;.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=35400 href="#35400">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2002 10:49:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>FTS users will be able to use your notation too, or any<br/>number of cents per any interval, - it shows it as<br/>[12] * 100 cents per octave<br/>but you can use a floating point number in place of thw<br/>12</p><p>[6.12]*100</p><p>to give your 612 cents per octave.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in the centisteps notation because it<br/>represents 17-tet well, or the other n-tets dep.</p><p>Then you can see where ratios are relative to it.<br/>Also you can show a ratio scale and vary the n-tet and<br/>see which ones are close to multiples of 100 cents for that<br/>n-tet, e.g. 200 cents of 900 per octave is close<br/>to 11/9.</p><p>It&apos;s purely because we are used to numbers to base 10<br/>and to the second power of 10 in percentage notations<br/>that it is quite intuitive seeming. If we were<br/>used to base 12 we&apos;d use that...</p><p>612 would seem quite natural to base 12 as it is<br/>430 to base 12<br/>and as 43 to base 12 is the same as 51 to base 10<br/>that means it is a good base for 51-tet.</p><p>So far, FTS is limited to 1000 cents per octave in the<br/>alternative bases notation, but it would be pretty<br/>easy to change that; so prob. I will, maybe for this<br/>next upload.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=35401 href="#35401">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2002 11:29:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m interested in the centisteps notation because it<br/>&gt; represents 17-tet well, or the other n-tets dep.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in it from the point of view of relative error, comparing one system to another, which is where Paul and I came at it from; and I must say I like my suggested &quot;rc&quot; for relative cents better than &quot;centisteps&quot;, which sounds like centipedes and has &quot;steps&quot; in it--what steps?
