Or even G(9/5) - B(9/4) - C#(5/4) - E(3/1).<br/>The 6-limit A and even B versions sound more natural and &quot;in the mode&quot;, but<br/>I love the spice the 7th harmonic Bb gives here :)</p><p>This piece of music solves the main 2 remaining questions I still had open<br/>on the implications of my theory (I thought and hoped it was like this<br/>allready but now I have actual music to back it up).</p><p>1: What happends when you play 2 diminished chords after eachother, a<br/>semitone or whole tone appart.<br/>My theory does not allow a diminished chord to go into another diminished<br/>chord in 6-limit, as there is only one diminished chord possible in the<br/>6-limit harmonic model of 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1,<br/>which is 9/8 4/3 8/5 15/8. And all chords must go to another chord in the<br/>same harmonic model with the same root (so only chords that can exist in 2<br/>harmonic model roots at once can change the harmonic model root)<br/>I was wondering wether if you did play 2 diminished chords one after another<br/>if this ment going to 7-limit or 8-limit (8-limit I would have haaated for<br/>several reasons).<br/>The above piece of music makes clear we go to 7-limit and stay in the same<br/>harmonic root :) A lovely solution I&apos;m very happy with. (the 7-limit<br/>diminished chord CAN change root btw, so after the 7-limit diminished we can<br/>have a 6-limit diminished again with a different root)</p><p>2: What happends when the music makes it really really clear we&apos;re playing a<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5 seventh chord, and yet then we raise the 1/1 by a semitone.<br/>This is something that can&apos;t be done in 6-limit.<br/>(The 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9 seventh chord (root 4/3) can do this in 6-limit to<br/>become 16/15 5/4 3/2 16/9 (root 4/3), better seen from the 4/3 root as 8/5<br/>15/8 9/4 8/3, the normal 6-limit diminished chord.)<br/>I allready noticed that even in 12tet when you raise the 1/1 in a clear 1/1<br/>5/4 3/2 9/5 seventh chord, that it sounds different, has a different &quot;feel&quot;<br/>than when raising a normal dominant V7 into a 6-limit diminished.<br/>Now it is clear to me, it rasing the 1/1 in 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5 indeed becomes<br/>21/20 5/4 3/2 9/5 :)<br/>The 7-limit diminished chord. Again by far the nicest solution, following<br/>perfectly the logic of my system, and it sounds great.</p><p>Anyhow, I was so happy to find my first 7th harmonic in common practice<br/>music I had to share :)<br/>Hope someone finds it interesting.</p><p>I&apos;ll finish up the Drei Equale No2 soon and render it with a real trombone<br/>quartet using Melodyne.<br/>I think I&apos;ll have it ready within a week.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 9:07:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
