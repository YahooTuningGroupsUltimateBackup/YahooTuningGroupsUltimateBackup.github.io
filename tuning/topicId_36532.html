Paul<br/>E.&apos;s<br/>&gt; last comments in a post about adaptive JI and Vicento&apos;s approach to<br/>&gt; it made me look at this.</p><p>quite a few months ago, joe monzo realized that 217-equal is<br/>excellent for implementing Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI approach, and was<br/>planning to use it to render some Mahler MIDI files he was working<br/>on. i think he mentioned that on tuning-math.</p><p>&gt; 7 X 31 = 217<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 217-EDO is a large numbered scale, but it is an extremely accurate<br/>&gt; finite or &quot;atomic&quot; model of up to 19-limit JI.</p><p>i agree that it stands out in this regard. i&apos;m pretty disappointed at<br/>myself for not noticing that it excels in both these aspects.</p><p>&gt; Has Gene or anyone<br/>&gt; looked at this.</p><p>217-equal has been getting a huge amount of &apos;airplay&apos; on tuning-math<br/>very recently. george secor and dave keenan seem to be, in different<br/>ways, using 217-equal as some kind of &apos;benchmark&apos; for their JI<br/>notation scheme, with 1600-equal an additional reference ET.</p><p>&gt; It also contains 31-EDO within it, so the options for<br/>&gt; comma drift avoidance are always there. What are its drawback other<br/>&gt; than its enormous size?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using the same approach with 19-EDO, you get:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 9 X 19 = 171<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 171-EDO has somewhat less accuracy,</p><p>or much more, if one only looks up through the 9-limit.</p><p>&gt; but it&apos;s still very accurate.<br/>&gt; Same questions apply.</p><p>171-equal has been discussed quite a lot historically, and on this<br/>list. search this list for &quot;171-tET&quot;, &quot;171-tone&quot;, etc.</p><p>both of these, as you&apos;ve presented them, are great examples of<br/>the &apos;bicycle concept&apos; that comes up from time to time. i brought both<br/>of them up in a brief survey of &apos;bikes&apos; that i posted here some time<br/>ago, in response to joseph pehrson. see if you can find that<br/>post . . .</p><p>personally, as i&apos;ve mentioned before, if i were to choose a large ET<br/>for composing, it would be 152-equal (8*19) . . . in addition to<br/>supporting a 1/3-comma version of adaptive (5-limit) JI, it&apos;s really<br/>good through 11-limit strict JI. combine this with the fact that 76-<br/>equal (152/2) comes up as &apos;universally&apos; important in my paper (near<br/>the end), and that 152 affords the opportunity to &apos;adaptively&apos;<br/>realize the resources of 76-equal but with far better vertical<br/>harmony, and you get an idea of a few of the reasons i like 152.</p></div><h3><a id=36561 href="#36561">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2002 5:17:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; In-Reply-To: &lt;a9vuvu+t2re@e...&gt;<br/>&gt; robert_wendell wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 7 X 31 = 217<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 217-EDO is a large numbered scale, but it is an extremely<br/>accurate<br/>&gt; &gt; finite or &quot;atomic&quot; model of up to 19-limit JI.

Oh<br/>well.  217= is only 21-limit consistent, and the simplest 31-limit<br/>consistent ETs are 311 and 388, neither of them multiples of 31.  217= has<br/>a worst error of 0.58 scale steps in the 31-limit, and is the simplest ET<br/>to nail the 31-limit to within 0.6 scale steps.  Perhaps that&apos;s important.</p><p>                             Graham</p></div>
