For the modes, it could be<br/>happening a lot slower.  Hey, since all CA&apos;s repeat themselves eventually,<br/>or eventually end up in repeating cycles, we&apos;d end up with some kind of<br/>isorhythm, as a set of timbres were &quot;cycled&quot; through, and a set of modes<br/>were &quot;cycled&quot; through, but at different rates.  Could be cool.</p><p>Also, we could make use of the extra dimension in determining timbre.<br/>Timbre is not only determined by partials and their strengths,  there are<br/>also such issues as attack strength, agitation during steady state (i.e,<br/>vibrato or tremolo), release,  amount of change in brightness---plus lots<br/>of other quirky parameters that one can almost invent.</p><p>One could specify &quot;areas&quot; of a 2D CA.  Each area (say, a 4X4 square) could<br/>be converted into a number (via binary arithmetic), which would then<br/>control the value of some timbral parameter.  For each note (i.e. for each<br/>CA generation) then, the parameters would be re-calculated.  Each note<br/>could then be individually sculpted according to its parameters.</p><p>Of course, one would have to find the right kind of CA for this---most 2D<br/>CAs end up very soon with, like, a squiggly monster in the middle and not<br/>much happening anywhere else---which would mean in sound, that those notes<br/>would have most of their parameters remaining constant, with very few<br/>changing.   One would have to find a CA with lots of activity all over the<br/>place for a good long time.</p><p>Anyway, just thinking out loud. . . .</p><p>CB</p></div>
