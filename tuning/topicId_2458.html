I was merely<br/>drawing a parallel between my theories and Fokkers<br/>in wanting to understand his, because up until February<br/>I was largely ignorant of his work.</p><p>Daniel Wolf has suggested that my use of &apos;finity&apos; is<br/>redundant because we have Fokker&apos;s term.  But I like<br/>&apos;finity&apos; precisely because I think it can be used more<br/>inclusively than just meaning the same thing as a<br/>&apos;periodicity block&apos;.  I feel that it can also be used<br/>to describe the kind of arbitrary limitation on expansion<br/>of musical resources that Partch &apos;invented&apos;, too.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;m being inconsistent, I just think<br/>&apos;finity&apos; can mean both types of reduction from infinity,<br/>and probably others too.</p><p>Often, when Partch and other JI composers use<br/>higher-identity triads in their compositions, the<br/>triads function in ways analogous to the way<br/>&apos;major&apos; and &apos;minor&apos; triads function, a good example<br/>being the 6:7:9.  This is an implicit use of &apos;bridging&apos;,<br/>even if the &apos;bridge&apos; interval or &apos;unison vector&apos; is<br/>not as small as the ones I normally refer to in my<br/>discussions.</p><p>I&apos;ve also discussed Schoenberg in connection with<br/>finity, in that he renounced microtonality and stuck<br/>with 12-eq, even tho he wanted to be able to &apos;expand<br/>tonality&apos;, because he also recognized &apos;bridges&apos; (the<br/>ones roundly criticized by Partch).  They&apos;re *far*<br/>larger than any intervals I would grace with the term,<br/>but in his mind and his theories, that&apos;s how it worked.</p><p>I don&apos;t see any inconsistency in using &apos;finity&apos; to<br/>describe all three theories - Partch, Fokker, or<br/>Schoenberg.</p><p>My conception of finity embraces the large idea that<br/>there&apos;s an infinity of pitch-resources available to<br/>musicians and no way that we can include infinity in<br/>our actual working set, so we have to find ways to<br/>make a finite set do the job.</p><p>And once you learn that there&apos;s more to music than<br/>12-eq, you&apos;ve got some work ahead of you to figure out<br/>how you&apos;re going to impose finity, because the possiblities<br/>are literally endless.  Partch&apos;s method was just one good way.</p><p>-monzo</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
