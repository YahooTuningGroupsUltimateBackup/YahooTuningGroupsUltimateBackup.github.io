What a<br/>privilege it is to partake of such a dialogue, enriched by some very<br/>practical musical experience as well as theoretical prowess and a due<br/>infusion of humor from various quarters.</p><p>Here I would like especially to thank Jacky Ligon for exploring an<br/>area which may lie on the interstices or border regions between what<br/>some of us have been describing as &quot;[small-integer] JI&quot; and RI<br/>involving large integer ratios not conceived in terms of partials.</p><p>What I might read some of your articles to describe is an approach<br/>where some large ratios (e.g. 29:23) might be conceived as harmonic or<br/>subharmonic constructs, although this derivation might in many timbres<br/>or contexts be beyond the discrete perception of the listener. In<br/>other words, am I right to understand that the complex as well as<br/>simple intervals -- the former often favored in your music mainly from<br/>a melodic point of view -- have a common harmonic/subharmonic design,<br/>although not all facets of that design may be explicitly heard in<br/>specifically &quot;harmonic/locking-in-partials&quot; terms?</p><p>How moving it has been, Jacky, to share with you the exciting and<br/>sometimes arduous adventure of confronting at least one widespread<br/>definition of &quot;JI,&quot; understanding its very significant and ably argued<br/>appeal, and asking what alternative categories and paradigms might<br/>bring out the distinctive musical qualities of other approaches to<br/>integer-based music.</p><p>From the viewpoint of typology, your articles in combination with<br/>those of Bill Alves and Dave Keenan, among others, suggest to me that<br/>&quot;JI&quot; in a generic or wide sense may have at least subgenera, so to<br/>speak, either of which might invite a comparably concise acronym:</p><p>        Harmonic Intonation (HI): JI where harmonicity and the<br/>        purest or most beatless tuning of sonorities possible<br/>        is the ideal -- or, from another view, the Partch/Doty<br/>        ideal that ratios should be kept as small as is fitting<br/>        for the musical context</p><p>        Rational Intonation (RI): JI where integer-based ratios,<br/>        simple or complex, are the distinguishing feature, many<br/>        of these ratios possibly having little if any obvious<br/>        connection with relations between partials, and with<br/>        beatlessness not necessarily a pervasive ideal,<br/>        especially for complex or unstable sonorities (e.g.<br/>        Gothic/neo-Gothic), or in primarily melodic rather than<br/>        polyphonic textures (e.g. ancient Greece a la Bill Alves).</p><p>It is easy to recognize Dave Keenan&apos;s JI as synonymous with HI, and<br/>indeed the two concepts are mostly synonymous in the late 15th-19th<br/>century era where &quot;Just&quot; seems a recognized category of tunings (your<br/>very important point of historical usage, Monz).</p><p>It also seems easy to recognize the JI of Bill Alves (who nicely expresses<br/>my accustomed concept also) as synonymous with RI, as you, Bill, yourself<br/>suggest. Themes such as superparticular ratios for tetrachord divisions,<br/>applying for example to melodic whole-tones and sometimes also to<br/>semitones (Archytus, Ptolemy), do seem to me a vital part of what I am<br/>used to calling &quot;the JI approach&quot; in ancient Greece.</p><p>The obvious bridge between the HI and RI facets of JI is that certain<br/>basic rational ratios prevalent in various world musics (2:1, 3:2,<br/>4:3) do produce pure vertical intervals -- or _consonantiae_ in the<br/>theory of Boethius (who takes _simultaneous_ intervals as the focus of<br/>the consonance concept).</p><p>Jacky, your approach maybe suggests how a musical style or<br/>intonational system can straddle these HI and RI approaches, for<br/>example by taking an HI outlook on some sonorities with small integer<br/>ratios, and an RI approach on melodic intervals or other vertical<br/>sonorities (possibly conceived in terms of some harmonic/subharmonic<br/>series).</p><p>An advantage to the &quot;JI as HI or RI&quot; approach is that it lets us -- to<br/>allude to some of your very moving words, Jacky -- joyously wear our<br/>chosen flags over our hearts, affirming that the same concept can mean<br/>different things to different people.</p><p>For Dave Keenan, barbershop is JI because, as we might say, it has an<br/>&quot;HI sound,&quot; however its intonational fine structure might be analyzed<br/>mathematically.</p><p>For some of us, large integer ratios are also JI because they have an<br/>artful &quot;RI design,&quot; manifesting itself in complexity as well as<br/>simplicity, although the effect may often be quite different than HI.</p><p>Taking this outlook, we might discuss a given piece of music as either<br/>HI or RI -- or possibly some creative fusion of the two constructs --<br/>while recognizing that either concept may reflect part of the semantic<br/>territory often associated with the JI category.</p><p>Again, Jacky, thank you alike for some great ratios and creative<br/>musical ideas seasoned with passion, humor, and friendly wisdom.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16497 href="#16497">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/12/2000 4:44:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

And by viewing and dividing up<br/>the pitch continuum in this manner, the composer is able to harness a<br/>spectrum of simple to complex &quot;flavors&quot;, which have at their &quot;root<br/>system&quot; the primary simple ratios of JI. Usually, when I&apos;m<br/>considering the division of a given pitch class into a number of<br/>harmonically related ratio, I&apos;m seeking to divide the range from<br/>roughly 1/4 tone, or neutral interval, below and above the primary<br/>ratio (currently I&apos;m dividing each pitch class into 12 parts with<br/>ratios). Working in this manner also has practical implications,<br/>related to mapping the tunings onto the instruments for which I am<br/>fated to make music with (I believe these scales would sit well on a<br/>MicroZone!).</p><p>As a result, my interest in this area has led me to explore, as one<br/>kind of rational construction; scales which have inversional<br/>symmetry. This scale type has always had a special allure in its<br/>sound for me, as I enjoy the evenness of the scale step sizes<br/>ascending from 1/1 and descending from 2/1. Beatlessness of intervals<br/>is but one feature of the kinds of scales assembled in such a manner.</p><p>The idea that I need the ability to freely call upon the most simple<br/>ratios for this beatless quality, and at the same time, strategically<br/>choose to use more complex intervals which lie above or below a<br/>simple ratio, has much to do with my compositional need to control<br/>the musical energies of tension and relaxation that is created by<br/>changing the tunings of instruments over the course of a composition.<br/>I need many varieties of seconds, thirds fourths, etc., to fulfill<br/>the requirements of a given composition, and enjoy the complete<br/>freedom to choose from the infinite spectrum of integer ratios for<br/>this purpose (although I rarely wander beyond the boundaries of 37<br/>prime with these RI tunings.). I believe that once a composer has<br/>command over the vocabulary of a broad range of ratios, by repeatedly<br/>experiencing them in a musical context, both the music and the<br/>experience of creating it, becomes significantly more meaningful.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky, your approach maybe suggests how a musical style or<br/>&gt; intonational system can straddle these HI and RI approaches, for<br/>&gt; example by taking an HI outlook on some sonorities with small<br/>integer<br/>&gt; ratios, and an RI approach on melodic intervals or other vertical<br/>&gt; sonorities (possibly conceived in terms of some harmonic/subharmonic<br/>&gt; series).</p><p>As above, the need to harness the music power from the extreme poles<br/>of simplicity and complexity in compositional settings, leads me<br/>toward rational tuning systems which would encompass both an HI and<br/>RI aesthetic. This is such a rich land of possibilities that even if<br/>I never went outside of this to explore things like the spectrum<br/>tunings, my musical diet of RI flavors, would be sufficient to<br/>sustain me for a very long time. Sometimes I seek to justly intone<br/>chords, other times to tune a single flute voice to a highly complex<br/>scale, which would not likely be harmonically functional (in the<br/>chordal sense). Even in the area neighboring around 4/3 and 3/2,<br/>there are many wonderful melodic, and or harmonic possibilities for<br/>either flattening or sharpening of these primary intervals. In my<br/>mind and experience, all of these represent valid choices depending<br/>on the musical context.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; An advantage to the &quot;JI as HI or RI&quot; approach is that it lets us --<br/>to<br/>&gt; allude to some of your very moving words, Jacky -- joyously wear our<br/>&gt; chosen flags over our hearts, affirming that the same concept can<br/>mean<br/>&gt; different things to different people.</p><p>Inspired by the above, and Bill Alves&apos; post:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16477">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16477</a></p><p>I would like to inject the following analogy:</p><p>Suppose that the Oxford Dictionary contained a frozen entry<br/>for &quot;Jazz&quot; that was based on what this term meant during the 1930s.<br/>Would any of us accept that this definition would have any meaning<br/>for what Jazz became in the decades following? I really think not.<br/>Words, meanings and definitions do undergo subtle, or not so subtle<br/>transformations over time. I realize there will be some out there who<br/>will find difference with this analogy, but it is a point about the<br/>evolution of the meanings of terms and language, not definitions. I<br/>personally am able to withstand this reality, and openly embrace the<br/>evolution of the term JI. I won&apos;t take it upon myself to correct<br/>those that use this to describe their rational tuning systems when<br/>they don&apos;t conform to the accepted definition, as my humble feeling<br/>is that our dialog about all this, is happening in a sort of<br/>isolated &quot;test-tube&quot; amidst a real-world musical reality, in which<br/>there are many worthy composers who do happen to see this in a<br/>different light (whether naive about the Oxford definition or not is<br/>irrelevant).</p><p>In light of the above, some part of me is troubled by a feeling that<br/>I &quot;caved&quot; to quickly on this, but since I have now eaten from &quot;The<br/>Tree of The Knowledge of Justness&quot;, I cannot return to my prior state<br/>of innocence. Ah, booted out of the JI Garden - but that fruit sure<br/>was tasty! Also, highly ironic to me is that I&apos;ve ended up in this<br/>discussion at all, since these things always disappear into their<br/>proper background when I set down to compose with - well - whatever<br/>you like to call it! All the same, I&apos;ve found it highly instructive<br/>and enriching to become involved (however unwittingly). To see this<br/>amazing discussion take place; with all of those that I deepest<br/>revere; has been worth all the effort to follow along (I sense it&apos;s<br/>not over yet either!).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For some of us, large integer ratios are also JI because they have<br/>an<br/>&gt; artful &quot;RI design,&quot; manifesting itself in complexity as well as<br/>&gt; simplicity, although the effect may often be quite different than<br/>HI.</p><p>Certainly speaks to my direction with the above analogy.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Taking this outlook, we might discuss a given piece of music as<br/>either<br/>&gt; HI or RI -- or possibly some creative fusion of the two constructs -<br/>-<br/>&gt; while recognizing that either concept may reflect part of the<br/>semantic<br/>&gt; territory often associated with the JI category.</p><p>Yes, in my mind, the concept of RI, with its range of simple to<br/>complex structures is a direct extension of the constructs of JI<br/>tuning systems (in the classic &quot;Oxford&quot; definition sense). I would<br/>personally be unable to conceive of the extended complexity of an &quot;RI-<br/>type&quot; of system without the foundation provided by the aesthetic of<br/>beatlessness offered by a HI/JI conception. It would be like trying<br/>to walk without gravity!</p><p>Kind Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
