One of its dialects has been<br/>&gt; &gt; implemented as computer software and is availlable at<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~mutabor/">http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~mutabor/</a>.<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/%7Emutabor/.>">http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/%7Emutabor/.></a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for mentioning MUTABOR. I didn&apos;t know development<br/>&gt; was still going on. Just now I tried the 4.0 beta on Windows.<br/>&gt; I tried to use it to play a MIDI file but got stuck.<br/>&gt; I created a new input device (the file), box (with route),<br/>&gt; and output device. But once this was done, the play button<br/>&gt; was not enabled and I didn&apos;t see how to proceed.<br/>&gt;<br/>You probably did not activate the logic. You must open a logic file and<br/>activate it (e.g. pressing the green traffic light). Unfortunately, I<br/>must confess, that from 3.1 the file playing is broken on windows. It<br/>might work but it might be about 7.5 times as slow as intended.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When I started considering music this was one of the topic I wanted<br/>&gt; &gt; to research. But somehow I ended up discussing partial order in tone<br/>&gt; &gt; systems. Nevertheless, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too strange that a good<br/>&gt; &gt; choir can deal with syntonic commas. One of the reason is: You don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; have to care about them unless the composer produced a collision.<br/>&gt; &gt; And that needs a strong melodic preparation or an unusual harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; progression. Harmonic resolution of the auditory system (including<br/>&gt; &gt; consonance/dissonance or timbre) is much stronger than melodic.<br/>&gt; &gt; A singer who is not keen on being a voice leader, can concentrate<br/>&gt; &gt; mainly on something like resonance and fit his/her voice before the<br/>&gt; &gt; standing wave has been established.<br/>&gt; &gt; Another problem: Every singer in a well-trained choir has started some<br/>&gt; &gt; time ago being a poorly trained one. During their education some of<br/>&gt; &gt; them have developed their absolute hearing to a certain extent (not<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily reliable), which helps them to detune melodic intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; in the &iuml;&iquest;&half;EURoeright way&iuml;&iquest;&half;EUR?. But this is more concerned with<br/>&gt; compensating the<br/>&gt; &gt; pythagorean comma or one of its equivalents for major (3T-1O), minor<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds (4t-1O), which are the building blocks of the syntonic comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Harmonic hearing resolution is only superior to melodic when<br/>&gt; beats can be heard, or at least, long steady tones in controlled<br/>&gt; circumstances. In musical settings like singing in a choir,<br/>&gt; melodic perception is at least as accurate. Even casual listeners<br/>&gt; often have a good sense of when a melody sounds &apos;wrong&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>Well, I&apos;m not totally convinced without further references. In some<br/>situations you are right, but casual listeners have also a good feeling<br/>whether something is in tune or somehow detuned. If you were right most<br/>people would find our JI demo piece detuned which is usually not the case.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unlike the Pythagorean comma, the syntonic comma exists in an<br/>&gt; unaltered diatonic scale. Rendering diatonic music in just<br/>&gt; intonation results in melodic distortions that many listeners<br/>&gt; find objectionable.<br/>&gt;<br/>How many from which cultural background? I know that certain people with<br/>musical background find everything strange that is slightly different<br/>from their usual standard. This is a question that is located somewhere<br/>in the grey zone between right and wrong, and  a matter of taste. Maybe<br/>I spent too much time on Mutabor development and other mathematical<br/>stuff to provide well-founded knowledge. But the most important problems<br/>I realized with JI are figures that are not modelled in our logic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you just want to simulate a choir, maybe one of the numeric models<br/>&gt; &gt; (Hermode, sensory dissonance) might be sufficient. If you are interested<br/>&gt; &gt; in musical consequences, an algebraic model can give you additional<br/>&gt; &gt; insights. So far I don&apos;t know any higher language but Mutabor that has<br/>&gt; &gt; existing Software that can perform such a model.
