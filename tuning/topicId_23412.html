These are interesting<br/>problems, and suggest good illustrations of Rusty.  I think there are<br/>two main ways of setting up the problem:</p><p>A. Specifying the criteria first and letting Rusty do the math.<br/>B. Specifying only the generators and letting Rusty handle the tempers.</p><p>The second automates the traditional methods (faithfully, I hope)<br/>while the first provides a more natural solution (to my way of thinking).<br/>I&apos;ll outline them below using Paul&apos;s decatonic as an example:</p><p>A. Specifying the criteria first and letting Rusty do the math.</p><p>(from my thesis, section 5.5 &quot;Pitch and Pitch Organization&quot; p 70.)</p><p>1. Define your intervals fuzzily.  E.g.,</p><p>&gt;One generator approximates a 4/3.<br/>&gt;Two generators approximate a 7/4.<br/>&gt;Three generators approximate a 7/3.<br/>&gt;A half-octave approximates a 7/5.<br/>&gt;Two generators minus a half-octave approximate a 5/4.<br/>&gt;Three generators minus a half-octave approximate a 5/3.</p><p>for each named interval, create an interval object---a representation<br/>of suitability vs. pitch distance.  The problem here is to describe<br/>how e.g., intervals other than 4/3 are suitable as 4/3. One could do<br/>this objectively, using a dissonance curve generated by an algorithm<br/>(like that of Plomp and Levelt or Kameoka and Kuriyakawa).  It&apos;s<br/>easier to visualize, however, if we imagine defining our personal<br/>opinion of an interval simply as a Gaussian bell-shaped curve peaking<br/>(=1) at 4/3, having a width (full width at half maximum) corresponing<br/>to how much deviation from a pure interval is acceptable, and approaching<br/>zero for intervals far from 4/3. I expect we would agree that more<br/>complex intervals can bear less tempering than simpler ones, so that<br/>4/3 would be a bit wider than 5/4, and so on.</p><p>2. Define a network of these intervals between the scalar degrees.<br/>(Assuming you&apos;ve defined the structure of the scale, its spelling,<br/>that is, to suit yourself.)<br/>c -4/3- f -4/3- b -4/3- e...<br/>c -7/4- b...<br/>c -7/5- gb...<br/>c -5/4- e, etc., for every interval that&apos;s important to you.</p><p>3. Define how important each of these relationships is within<br/>the context of the scale.  E.g., the curve with which you represent<br/>a 4/3 defines what you think about the nature of 4/3s in general,<br/>but within the context of this tuning, the purity of the 4/3s<br/>may be more or less important to you.  This can be done based on<br/>scale structure (i.e., spelling relationships), interval relationships<br/>(e.g., all 4/3s), or between specific degrees (e.g., c-f is more<br/>important than c#-f#).  Note that this could be used to design<br/>well temperaments.  Internally, the Rusty algorithm sharpens or<br/>softens the peaks according to their importance---there are also<br/>other, global parameters which affect this, exaggerating or reversing<br/>the effect.</p><p>4. Let the algorithm run.  For each degree, it:</p><p>a. finds all pathways to any absolute pitch definitions.<br/>b. adds up (by convolution) the fuzzy intervals along each pathway of<br/>  defined intervals.  This yeilds a fuzzy interval for each pathway.<br/>c. combines (by multiplication) the intervals of the pathways,<br/>  producing one fuzzy pitch (the fuzzy interval plus the absolute<br/>  pitch definition).<br/>d. defuzzifies (by finding the median maximum) the fuzzy pitch,<br/>  yeilding a single, crisp pitch (but the fuzzy curve could<br/>  be very intersting to see---or to use compositionally).</p><p>I think that this way of defining the problem is the way we actually<br/>think of it---by stating the criteria first and then trying to<br/>achieve them in practice.  The second way, of dictating the tempers<br/>beforehand, is still interesting and useful.  I&apos;ve provided for it<br/>in Rusty, and the description is in my thesis, at the end of the<br/>long tuning section, in the subsection titled &quot;Temperaments&quot; on p 144.</p><p>B. Specifying only the generators and letting Rusty handle the tempers.</p><p>After performing steps 1--3 above, perhaps defining only the two<br/>cycles of fourths and the half-octave relationship, it&apos;s possible to<br/>apply tempers to the intervals in various ways, and of calculating<br/>the values of the tempers in various ways. For example, I have<br/>algorithms for finding all sequences and cycles involving a range<br/>of intervals (e.g., anything close to a fourth) which would find the<br/>two cycles of fourths in the definition (and deal with branching,<br/>if there were any), find the discrepency (the &quot;comma&quot;) and assign<br/>tempers in whatever units (e.g., in terms of the comma) according<br/>to pattern, accumulating errors into a wolf if necessary.  There are<br/>other, more exotic options than this, but that&apos;s a brief overview.<br/>Having done this, one may run the optimization of the tuning as<br/>usual, or simply take the assigned tempers (by setting all the<br/>importances to zero with a global parameter), having used to facility<br/>to find the cycles, commas, etc.</p><p>Margo also brings up the problem of optimally tuning a 14:18:21:24<br/>chord.  Rusty allows a number of methods for defining chords (section<br/>6.4, p 184), including defining them as miniature tunings.  So, one<br/>could define this chord as above or use the pattern to define a<br/>suitable tuning.</p><p>Margo, thank you for your kind regard; I&apos;ve been admiring your posts<br/>for a long time and hope to hear your music someday.
