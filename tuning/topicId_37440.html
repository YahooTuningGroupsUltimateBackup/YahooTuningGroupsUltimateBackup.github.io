You can<br/>download a demo.  Somebody with advanced desires in notation may like to<br/>see how far it fulfils them -- it covers everything I know except the<br/>microtonality.</p><p>The idea would be that you can use the new accidentals as accidentals<br/>(rather than arbitrary symbols) with keyboard shortcuts.  In addition,<br/>playback will be in either 72- or 24-equal using pitchbends, single<br/>timbrally, through a sound card.</p><p>I&apos;m intending the simplest implementation that&apos;ll work.  So it will be<br/>only these two systems and not a configurable microtonal support.<br/>Playback will only be in 24 or 72 so the MIDI implementation will only<br/>need 2 or 6 channels with a simple algorithm.</p><p>I want to know if anybody is interested.  The package is 115 pounds I<br/>think (say $170, check the website) and the microtonal add-on would cost<br/>about 20 pounds.  That should make it accessible to a wide range of people<br/>who are interested in microtonality with conventional notation.  Bernard<br/>did point out that a large proportion of his users don&apos;t have MIDI<br/>keyboards, so this would be a way of experimenting with microtonality.</p><p>I&apos;ve been given a quote of 2000 pounds (about $3000) for doing the work.<br/>For that I&apos;d get one free copy of the full package, and any money raised<br/>by selling the addon would be refunded until we&apos;re quits.  I do have the<br/>money in the bank, but can think of other things I&apos;d like to spend it on.<br/> So would anybody be prepared to share the cost with me?  It&apos;d mean<br/>sending me the money which will get into complications of trust and<br/>international money transfers.  You&apos;ll also have to pay for your own copy.<br/> But what do people think?  If anybody wants to take over from me, that&apos;d<br/>be fine.</p><p>This is an opportunity to get microtonal support in an affordable package.<br/> You know exactly how much it&apos;ll cost, so see if you think it&apos;s<br/>worthwhile.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=37479 href="#37479">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2002 5:24:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_37440.html#37440">/tuning/topicId_37440.html#37440</a></p><p>&gt; Hello all!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been discussing with Bernard Hill about getting this Music<br/>Publisher<br/>&gt; software to support Tartini quartertone and Sims/Maneri 72-equal<br/>notation.<br/>&gt;  See &lt;<a href="http://www.braeburn.co.uk">http://www.braeburn.co.uk</a>&gt; for what it currently does.

I&apos;m not going round all the<br/>companies making proposals, although if people are prepared to pledge the<br/>money you could always try that.  Bernard made an offer, and we can take<br/>or leave it.  He isn&apos;t a fan of alternative tunings, and won&apos;t do the work<br/>for his own pleasure, at least not beyond quartertones.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3><a id=37545 href="#37545">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 7:47:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_37440.html#37544">/tuning/topicId_37440.html#37544</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Pet Walton&apos;s &quot;temperaments plug in&quot; is quite interesting, and<br/>Graham<br/>&gt; &gt; should see it, but it still involves using the STANDARD Sibelius<br/>&gt; &gt; accidental set.

I<br/>believe there were 9 in all, if I remember correctly, for each letter<br/>name.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But Sibelius has a *huge* platform and is a fully professional<br/>&gt; &gt; product.

It also converts all my older scores<br/>from IBM SCORE format...
