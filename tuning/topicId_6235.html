(Well, okay, I freely admit that when music of the<br/>late Romantic era waxes contrapuntal, I get claustrophobic.)<br/>Jay</p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/1999 9:59:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Jay Williams, TD 397.21]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks much, Joe, for that very revealing MIDI file.</p><p>You&apos;re quite welcome.  I&apos;ve come to realize that getting<br/>Haba&apos;s work before the public is important.</p><p>&gt; I confess to a gross unfamiliarity with Haba&apos;s music,</p><p>Well, that was the case for me too, until just a couple of<br/>weeks ago.  I decided to sequence Haba&apos;s work because he&apos;s<br/>often referred to as an important microtonalist, but very<br/>little of his work is available in any format (recording<br/>or score).  Based on what I hear in my MIDI files, I&apos;m<br/>beginning to think that a major microtonal composer has<br/>been sadly neglected lately.</p><p>&gt; but considering his place in time, I&apos;m not surprised by what<br/>&gt; I hear.</p><p>Interesting that you should say that, because I had made<br/>MIDI files of the little snippets of Haba&apos;s _2nd Quartet_<br/>I&apos;d seen used as musical examples of microtonality in books<br/>and was definitely not impressed.  When I finally got<br/>a look at the whole score, and had a large enough musical<br/>statement to work with so that it made some sense, my sequence<br/>of *that* still didn&apos;t impress me, at first.  It was only<br/>after really examining the melodic pitch- and phrase-structure,<br/>and shaping the tempos accordingly, that it finally started<br/>sounding like an interesting piece.  And I *was* surprised<br/>by what I heard, because...</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t remember whose post it was that mentioned the<br/>&gt; various resolutions in the various parts, but it illuminated<br/>&gt; my ambivalence toward this music.  I certainly found it<br/>&gt; evocative. But to my ears he&apos;s clearly a Zemlinsky-style<br/>&gt; late romantic and in that idiom the relationships between<br/>&gt; tonalities and melodic motions are already so complex and<br/>&gt; time-dependent, that the addition of 12 more tones to the<br/>&gt; mix makes these relationships even more fluid. So, the first<br/>&gt; thing I notice is that a resolution can have one of two degrees<br/>&gt; of consonance.</p><p>I too hear the &apos;late-romanticism&apos; in Haba&apos;s style, and I<br/>was *not* expecting that!  Altho, as I have said, it sounds<br/>to me like Haba clearly learned a lot from Schoenberg, and<br/>Haba&apos;s quartet sounds to me more like a microtonal version<br/>of Schoenberg&apos;s early chamber music than anything else.<br/>Of course, Zemlinsky was a huge influence on Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>early work.</p><p>Another thing worth examining is the fact that Zemlinsky was<br/>working as a conductor in Prague during Haba&apos;s earliest<br/>years there.  The available English biographical sources<br/>don&apos;t say that they ever met or corresponded, but I wouldn&apos;t<br/>rule it out until I&apos;ve consulted the Czech bios of Haba.</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;d like to hear is more quarter-tone music in an idiom<br/>&gt; with a much simpler hierarchy of tonality. Is there, for<br/>&gt; example, any serial compositions using a 24-tone row? Or,<br/>&gt; is there a Verese-type person using 31-tet?</p><p>Henri Pousseur wrote some microtonal compositions: I know<br/>of one in 19-ET, and most likely they&apos;re serial.  I discussed<br/>some of this on the List earlier this year - check the<br/>Archives.</p><p>And whenever the words &apos;microtonal&apos; and &apos;serial&apos; come<br/>together, I always bring up Ben Johnston&apos;s outstanding<br/>_6th Quartet_.  You&apos;ll probably find stuff I&apos;ve written<br/>about this in the Tuning List Archives too.  An excellent<br/>analysis of the piece is Steven Elster, &apos;A Harmonic and<br/>Serial Analysis of Ben Johnston&apos;s String Quartet No. 6&apos;,<br/>in _Perspectives of New Music_, v 29 # 2 [summer 1991],<br/>p 138-165.  There was a recording available on LP, which<br/>may still be found in libraries.</p><p>Note that Johnston does *not* use quarter-tones, etc.,<br/>but composes in JI as did Partch, using a notation of<br/>his own invention which precisely stipulates the ratios<br/>he wants.  I consider it a tremendous intellectual feat<br/>that he was able to combine typical JI harmonic movement<br/>with serial procedure, in a piece that also *sounds*<br/>terrific.</p><p>You might also be interested in my _24-Equal Tune_ if you&apos;ve<br/>never heard it.  The MIDI file and program notes are at:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/24-eq/24-eq.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/24-eq/24-eq.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;m not sure what a harmonic analysis of this tune would<br/>make of it - I simply tuned my keyboard in 24-ET and put<br/>the piece together out of what I heard, without really<br/>thinking &apos;this quarter-tone implies that ratio&apos;, etc.<br/>It is most definitely tonal, and probably quite simply<br/>harmonically, but I haven&apos;t really probed into it.</p><p>It is what its title calls it: a tune, and no more.<br/>So don&apos;t expect a substantial piece like Haba&apos;s.<br/>(my MIDI of Haba&apos;s quartet is just a fragment right now)</p><p>&gt; I have a tape of Vyshnegrodsky&apos;s &quot;Zarathustra&quot; (or is there<br/>&gt; an &quot;also Sprach&quot; in the title)</p><p>Yes indeed.  The title is _Ainsi Parlait Zarathoustra_,<br/>which is French for _Also Sprach Zarathustra_.</p><p>Vyschnegradsky (spelled Wyschnegradsky on the score) apparently<br/>also wrote a symphonic poem after Nietzsche&apos;s book, just like<br/>Strauss.</p><p>&gt; for four pianos, a pair at standard pitch and a pair a<br/>&gt; quarter-tone flat.</p><p>Vyschnegradsky calls it a &apos;symphony in the quarter-tone<br/>system for orchestra of four pianos&apos;.</p><p>The pianos are divided into 2 groups, each one comprised<br/>of one piano tuned regularly, and one tuned a quarter-tone<br/>*higher*, not lower.  (Not that it really makes a difference<br/>- he could have tuned them that way and notated it differently,<br/>with virtually the same result, except for slight differences<br/>in timbre and note-range.)</p><p>The score to this piece is yet another treasure that I&apos;ve<br/>discovered lying in obscurity at the Van Pelt Library at<br/>University of Pennsylvania.  I hope to make a MIDI file<br/>of this too.</p><p>&gt; His style features more clusters and other textures that<br/>&gt; make the tuning seem a more integral feature. To me, that<br/>&gt; piece simply has no 12-tet equivalent.</p><p>Well, coming after your comments about Haba&apos;s quartet,<br/>this statement makes it sound like you mean to imply<br/>that Haba&apos;s music *does* have a 12-tET equivalent, and<br/>I&apos;m not so sure about that...</p><p>Unfortunately, the PhD dissertation about Haba&apos;s _Neue<br/>Harmonielehre_, by Suzette Mary Battan, has a &apos;part 2&apos;<br/>which is a complete English translation of Haba&apos;s book,<br/>but which is not included on the microfilm which has<br/>part 1.  So I was able to read Battan&apos;s analysis of<br/>Haba&apos;s theories, but not a translation of the theories<br/>themselves.  The book itself is available (in German),<br/>and I&apos;ll have to consult that to learn more.</p><p>From what I&apos;ve learned of Haba&apos;s theories and compositions<br/>so far, I&apos;d say that he was generally *not* thinking of<br/>the rational implications of his quarter-tone music.<br/>He seems to be more interested in setting up various<br/>types of quarter-tone scales and using the pitches both<br/>melodically and harmonically.  A lot of his theoretical<br/>ideas are very closely related to Schoenberg&apos;s (as<br/>presented in *his* _Harmonielehre_ of 1911).</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
