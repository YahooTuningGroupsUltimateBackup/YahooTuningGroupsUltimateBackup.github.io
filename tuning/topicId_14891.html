They are<br/>shown in the Images section of my home page. You&apos;ll see the construction of the<br/>triacontrahedron from them there too.</p><p>The 3d Penrose tilings had lots of these triacontrahedra in them. So you can get<br/>thee triacontrahedra in projections into 3D of silces through a regular tiling by six<br/>dimensional hyper-cubes.</p><p>In fact there is a way of recombining the cells of this golden rhombohedron tiling to<br/>make a tiling of 3D space by triacontrahedra (the Eikosany), rhombic icosahedra,<br/>rhombic dodecahedra, and the prolate golden rhombohedron, with none of the<br/>oblate golden rhombohedra. (discovered by Soccolar). This (non periodic) tiling<br/>has _lots_ of the triacontrahedra.</p><p>I have a feeling they also come up in Coxeter&apos;s Regular Polytopes in connection<br/>with higher dimensional hyper-cubes, but can&apos;t remember the connection now,<br/>could look it up.</p><p>Is there a particular well established set of ratios to use for the rhombic<br/>triacontrahedron? I think this is the one you call an Eikosany?</p><p>I could easily do that, and could also do some extra lines inside the triacontrahedron<br/>corresponding the the construction from golden rhombohedra. (Lots more hidden<br/>faces where the tiles meet)</p><p>This is the page that introduces the golden rhombohedra, and construction of<br/>triacontrahedron from them, with ray traced images:<br/><a href="http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/cubeetc/rhombic.htm">http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/cubeetc/rhombic.htm</a></p><p>and this is the VRML model of it, which I could add ratios to:<br/><a href="http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/gr_triacontrahedron.wrl">http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/gr_triacontrahedron.wrl</a></p><p>There&apos;s also a rotatable anaglyph on the anaglyphs page.</p><p>Rather than type everything in individually, probably I&apos;d do a little program to<br/>make the more complex vrml models - the model of the triacontrahedron made<br/>out of golden rhombohedra was made using a little prog I did especially for it<br/>(and the other two golden rhombohedra models), so could prob. adapt that<br/>for the Eikosany,</p><p>And prob. could do some update of the VRML Trees prog. to handle CPS sets<br/>in a more general way, looking a bit further into the future.</p><p>(Will be nice to do some more on that - it got within a few weeks of release, then<br/>I got so involved and fasinated by all the tuning related things that I never finished<br/>it, but now they seem to be coming together!)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=14902 href="#14902">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
