Bruce teaches at McGill in<br/>Montreal, and I studied there with him a few years ago. He has been a<br/>champion of Wyschnegradsky&apos;s music for a long time, and premiered many of<br/>his quarter- and 6th-tone pieces. My favourite microtonal piece by Mather<br/>himself is for four pianos (8 hands) in quarter-tones plus four<br/>ondes-martenot. sorry, can&apos;t remember what it&apos;s called.  There are a<br/>couple of recordings put out by McGill Records of his 1/4-tone stuff,<br/>played by him and his wife Pierrette, and his 1/6th-tone stuff on 3<br/>pianos. You can probably find out through the McGill music website,<br/><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca">http://www.music.mcgill.ca</a>.  Mather also uses a lot of quarter-tones in<br/>his recent chamber opera, &quot;La Princesse Blanche&quot;. By the way, there are<br/>some other fine composers who teach at McGill, notably Brian Cherney. It&apos;s<br/>a great school, and a wonderful city, to be a musician in.</p><p>cheers - Jon</p></div>
