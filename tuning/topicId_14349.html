However, as in<br/>Newtonian or Einsteinian relativity, we can associate the change or<br/>&quot;motion&quot; with either the choice of mode or transposition in the music,<br/>or with the choice of tuning set or &quot;modal/key color.&quot;</p><p>For example, in an early 15th-century Pythagorean tuning of Gb-B,<br/>cadences on F will have regular Pythagorean major thirds and sixths<br/>expanding to fifths and octaves, while cadences on D or G will have<br/>&quot;smoothed&quot; diminished fourths and sevenths. The former cadences will<br/>have the usual compact diatonic semitones or limmas, the latter the<br/>large chromatic semitones or apotomes.</p><p>SImilarly, in an 18th-century well-temperament, the key of C major<br/>will have meantone-like thirds not too far from pure, somewhat narrow<br/>fifths, and large diatonic semitones; something like G# minor will<br/>have Pythagorean or near-Pythagorean thirds, pure or near-pure fifths,<br/>and narrow diatonic semitones.</p><p>However, rather than changing the location of a cadence or key, we can<br/>also change the tuning &quot;color&quot; itself. Thus in the early 15th century<br/>Pythagorean setting, we might take a piece in D Dorian -- or maybe<br/>just a cadence on D (which can happen in various modes) -- and change<br/>from a Gb-B color to an Eb-G# color. This makes the cadential major<br/>thirds and sixths the usual Pythagorean flavor rather than the<br/>smoother (and less dynamic) diminished fourths and sevenths.</p><p>Likewise, in an 18th-century setting, we could take the same piece in<br/>C major and change the permutations of the pure and tempered fifths in<br/>the well-temperament to get different &quot;colors.&quot;</p><p>Here there&apos;s one possible complication: we have been assuming that<br/>changing the &quot;color&quot; will produce different but musically &quot;acceptable&quot;<br/>results in a given style. For example, either a regular Pythagorean<br/>major third or a diminished fourth seems &quot;acceptable&quot; for early<br/>15th-century music; and likewise the various flavors of intervals in<br/>an 18th-century well-temperament.</p><p>One distinction between these two examples is that with 15th-century<br/>Pythagorean tuning, we have the matter of the Wolf fifth or fourth<br/>(actually diminished sixth or augmented third, e.g. Eb-G# or Gb-B) to<br/>consider. If a piece calls for a prominent fifth B-F#, and our &quot;change<br/>of color&quot; substitutes B-Gb, this may not be good news. However,<br/>15th-century theorists themselves provide a solution: we don&apos;t have to<br/>limit ourselves to the 12 notes of a single &quot;color.&quot; A 13-note set<br/>with both Gb and F# solves this kind of problem.</p><p>In this early 15th-century setting, _many_ changes of &quot;color&quot; remain<br/>musically acceptable, just as in your example of changing the mode of a<br/>piece, where substituting a tritone or diminished fifth for a regular<br/>fourth or fifth can likewise be a complication -- solvable by the use<br/>of an accidental alteration (e.g. Bb-F, B-F#).</p><p>With Renaissance mantone, however, there is an important caution:<br/>substituting a diminished fourth like E-Ab for a major third like E-G#<br/>is rarely likely to be musically &quot;acceptable&quot; in this kind of style.<br/>It&apos;s less of a &quot;nuance of color&quot; -- the early 15th-century situation<br/>-- than a &quot;wrong note.&quot;</p><p>Note that this is a matter of style: changes of color are much more<br/>restricted in a 16th-century meantone context than in an early<br/>15th-century Pythagorean or 18th-century well-tempered one. We might<br/>say that most changes of color which alter intervals alter them into<br/>&quot;Wolves&quot; -- as defined by conventional 16th-century standards.</p><p>However, if we came up with a timbre and style where either meantone<br/>major thirds or diminished fourths could be freely interchanged while<br/>remaining &quot;stylistically apt,&quot; then we could have free changes of<br/>&quot;modal/key color&quot; just as in the historical 15th-century and<br/>18th-century styles I&apos;ve discussed.</p><p>One such style might be a kind of far-out neo-early-15th-century<br/>neo-Gothic based on 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET, for example, where<br/>diminished fourths (32:25, ~427 cents) are the favored major thirds<br/>for cadences involving sharps, while the 5:4 major thirds can be used<br/>in certain cadential and noncadential settings also (like Pythagorean<br/>diminished fourths).</p><p>A 12-note color of Gb-B in 1/4-comma meantone provides the basis for<br/>this &quot;far-out&quot; style.</p><p>Anyway, getting back to 15th-century or 18th-century practice, I<br/>wonder whether you might find &quot;modal/key color&quot; a useful term for a<br/>&quot;chromatic mode&quot; -- or maybe an encouragement to come up with<br/>something better? As to the names of these colors or whatever, I guess<br/>Paul Erlich has provided a solution there.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
