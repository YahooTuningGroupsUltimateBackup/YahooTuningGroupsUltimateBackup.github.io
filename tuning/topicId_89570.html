If you start by labeling the ratio 7/4 a septimal minor 7th, then starting from C, for example, that interval would by definition terminate in a Bb.  The septimal comma 64/63 is the difference between a Pythagorean minor 7th (16/9) and the septimal minor 7th.  The ratio of 21/20 would be a minor second/diatonic semitone (C-Db) while 15/14 would correspond to an augmented unison/chromatic semitone (C-C#).  For some reason, the ratio 15/14 I think has been incorrectly called a diatonic vice chromatic semitone.  (Perhaps it is because the 15/14 value is close the 1/4-comma meantone diatonic semitone.)  If 15/14 were diatonic it would correspond to C-Db in a just tuning.  This would make sense only if we start with the 7/4 ratio as an augmented 6th (C-A#) rather than a minor 7th.  OTOH, you could construct a just C diatonic scale, for example, with the intervals E-F and B-C having a ratio of 15/14 but then you can end up with strange (non-customary ratios) for major 3rds, etc.  Sincerely,</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2010 5:57:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ham_45242&quot; &lt;arl_123@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello, and &quot;chromatic&quot; and &quot;diatonic&quot; seem to have gotten interchanged.

Your idea leads to &quot;dominant temperament&quot;, and the only tuning which makes much sense for dominant is 12-equal. You&apos;ve been weened on 12, and to you it makes sense to think in terms of dominant. But it doesn&apos;t really make much sense outside of a 12 context, and 12 is not the basis for the traditional Western names for intervals. Another possibility for extending to the 7-limit is flattone, by the way, which has it that 7/4 is a diminished minor seventh.

In the case of meantone temperament, the 7-comma (7C, 63:64) and the 125 small diesis (125S, 125:128) are represented by a single interval (an augmented 7th), which may function either as a (septimal) comma or (125) diesis.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>ham_45242 &#x3C;arl_123@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2010 11:04:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ham_45242&quot; &lt;arl_123@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello, and &quot;chromatic&quot; and &quot;diatonic&quot; seem to have gotten interchanged.

A naming system which starts off assuming JI really works better on the whole. 7/6 could be &quot;subminor third&quot;, 9/7 &quot;supermajor third&quot;, 7/4 &quot;harmonic seventh&quot; and Scala could correct its list of names, which not only calls 9/7 a septimal major third, a bad idea, it calls it a BP third, a true naming atrocity because it drags in BP, not an important tuning system in the first place, and one that has no fifth.</p></div>
