The latter temperaments<br/>share a sequence of 1/4-comma fifths with meantone and the remaining fifths<br/>could be tuned with some sensitivity according to the needs of the repertoire<br/>at hand.</p><p>I recall an interview with Gustav Leonhardt where he was very coy about his<br/>present tuning practices. It seems that, once having absorbed the process of<br/>tuning meantone and a handfull of well temperaments, the player becomes free<br/>to customize his/her temperament to the repertoire at hand and that<br/>customization will seldom follow any of the prescriptions for named<br/>temperaments exactly.</p><p>Is it an unreasonable proposition that such customized tunings are likely to<br/>better represent the historical performance practice?</p></div>
