I tend to find that he really cornered himself and find much of his work all basically the same in content. For Phillip Guston i think is far more succesful than the 2nd quartet. His larger works don&apos;t at all for me. Even with the score and multiple recordings For Samuel Becket is alway 12 min too long, and if i sit there<br/>and listen (which i do with music) i end up taking it off. Same with Coptic Night. yes he has the detail down , but misses any over all sense. But his appraoch would result in this, would it not. it is really hard to beat his last piece Piano, Violin, Viola, Cello. His music is universally creepy which can possibly be a good thing, but given the freedom to do what<br/>you want, i would hope to be able to do more than that.<br/> Late mozart is the most polite horror stories ever written. possibly one of the most dissonant composers of all time. Like Prokofiev, who he shares a childhood aptitude with , the piano concertos might be the most revealing.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Compare this with the music of Morton Feldman.

Give me a<br/>six-hour-string-quartet sized break...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Interesting that a few negative words about Mozart (a dead guy)<br/>prompt such indignation while almost nobody speaks up on<br/>behalf of (living) Milton Babbitt when he was verbally slighted on<br/>this list. Mozart is _dead and his music continues to flood<br/>American &quot;classical music&quot; radio waves and concert halls<br/>_ad_nauseum, like a vast cloud of cheese-wiz (the mild variety).<br/>Turn on your radio to the local &quot;classical&quot; station and what do you<br/>probably hear? Mozart. His music is beaten to death over radio<br/>waves and in the concert halls, over and over and over. If I hear<br/>&quot;Eine Kleine Nichtmusik&quot; one more time, bastardized in pop<br/>culture, as the ringer on your cell phone, or packaged into<br/>ridiculous &apos;baby music&apos; CDs ...  Really, it is nauseating. On the<br/>other hand, a serious composer of new music, like Milton Babbitt<br/>(who is very much alive right now, by the way) - composers who<br/>are writing exciting and provocative NEW music - get almost no<br/>air play and very few concerts in large part because Mozart is<br/>hogging the space, time and resources that should be given to<br/>new music. This could be the most screwed up musicological<br/>phenomenon in history. It doesn&apos;t matter what you think about<br/>Babbitt&apos;s music aesthetically. Concerts used to be held so that<br/>new works could be heard, and audiences gathered specifically<br/>to hear new works - new spectacles, kind of like the movie<br/>theatres of today. But now they all flock to hear Mozart over and<br/>over, and they don&apos;t even know why. If you are a composer this<br/>really should bother you. Why would any composer _want to<br/>write &quot;symphony&quot; today? It won&apos;t get performed, or it will get one<br/>performance followed by a lifetime on a shelf, because the<br/>orchestras are like museums, displaying the &grave;old masters&apos; only,<br/>token commissions and Pierre Boulez notwithstanding. Of<br/>course, among composers of new music there is even a smaller<br/>niche of composers - the so-called &quot;microtonal&quot; composers -<br/>who get these ghettoized festivals and curiosity recordings,<br/>interviews and concerts here and there because they are being<br/>even more squeezed out than everyone else by Herr Mozart and<br/>his tired old Symphonies and Sonatas which dominate the<br/>mainstream canned-spam &quot;classical&quot; music air waves and<br/>concert halls. Living composers are writing serious new art<br/>music and they deserve to have radio play and concerts of their<br/>work. Living composers deserve more respect, support, and<br/>opportunities to share their work. And if all I were concerned<br/>about was trashing Mozart, then I would need only mention the<br/>name of Bach - there is no argument against the bold, assertive,<br/>rhetorical high contrapuntal technique of Bach versus the<br/>specific lack of these things in Mozart, who was comparatively a<br/>_genuine_hack in these areas - a really obvious observation - an<br/>admission of inferiority said to be given by Mozart himself. I<br/>mentioned Morton Feldman because Feldman&apos;s music, like<br/>Mozart&apos;s, is comparatively unassertive, and even more severely<br/>antithetical to Bach.
