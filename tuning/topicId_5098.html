If we view MOS&apos;s as 1D periodicity blocks<br/>[only those unison vectors which allow the generator to subtend a fixed<br/>number of scale degrees count, but these are going to occur at small<br/>intervals, relative to the number of generators in the chain, and so will<br/>be intuitive unison vectors most of the time], then it is no more<br/>surprising than the fact that ET&apos;s with good x&apos;s have the same number of<br/>notes per y as MOS&apos;s of generator x and interval of equivalence y.</p><p>[Paul Hahn]<br/>&gt;For example, the simplest set of unison vectors for 12TET at the 5-limit<br/>&gt;form the matrix:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&#x9;| 4 -1 | = 12<br/>&gt;&#x9;| 0  3 |<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By substituting (-1 2) for (0 3) (implying that the 25/24, chromatic<br/>&gt;semitone, &quot;vanishes&quot;--IOW, the 6/5 and the 5/4 are the same generic<br/>&gt;interval) you get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&#x9;| 4 -1 | = 7<br/>&gt;&#x9;|-1  2 |<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;implying heptatonic scales, the simplest of which is the diatonic set.<br/>&gt;But you can embed the diatonic set in other scales which use (4 -1) as a<br/>&gt;unison vector such as 19TET [(4 -1), (-1 5)] or 31TET [(4 -1), (-1 8)].</p><p>What determines if you can embed one scale in another like this?

The<br/>&gt;usual approach is to use the &quot;unit square&quot; from the origin to (1,1), but of<br/>&gt;course we are free to translate this square wherever we want since the<br/>&gt;result will still tile the plane with the unison vectors as generators.</p><p>I can&apos;t say I have a clue about this transformation.
