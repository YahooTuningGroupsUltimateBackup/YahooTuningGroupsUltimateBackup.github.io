The reasons are no doubt very complex and we can only offer<br/>    here a simplistic explanation.  With the exception of a few<br/>    scholars, most theoreticians, cognoscenti and even many music lovers<br/>    have tended to believe that the reason underlying the fact that<br/>    contemporary performance practice does not conform to the theories<br/>    espoused in the historical Sanskrit treatises is because performers<br/>    have neglected the sources (or been unable to consult them) and thus<br/>    the music has degenerated.  As a result, they have not only been<br/>    critical of performance but on occasion, have attempted to impose<br/>    their notions on performers.  The most obvious instance of this has<br/>    been the case of the harmonium which has been criticised by numerous<br/>    scholars [4] and was banned from All India Radio for perhaps twenty<br/>    years because its basically tempered set of twelve semitones were<br/>    thought to dull the acute sense of perception implicit in the 22<br/>    /shruti/ (microtone) octave described by the most revered Sanskrit<br/>    musical treatises (e.g., /Naatyashaastra/ and /Sa.ngiita<br/>    Ratnaakara/).  The harmonium has been used as an accompaniment by<br/>    some of the leading singers of this century and still continues to<br/>    be used in this capacity.  The issue that emerges from this is<br/>    whether or not those who presume to know what Indian classical music<br/>    ought to be have the right to censor musical practice.<br/>        It is not at all surprising that attitudes of this kind caused a<br/>    rift between theorists and practising musicians.  If the breach is<br/>    to be repaired, theory must follow practice -- not attempt to<br/>    dictate the course of practice;  if, however, theoreticians can<br/>    create one or more theories which are meaningful to the performers,<br/>    they will undoubtably feed back into practice, but this must be left<br/>    to the discretion of the performer/composers, and not dictated by<br/>    the theoreticians.</p><p>    --------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    [4] e.g., Fox Strangeways, A.H., /Music of Hindostan/, p.16.</p><p>    ====================================================================</p><p>    (pp. 34-35)</p><p>        While the present-day North Indian gamut is comparable to the<br/>    twelve-semitone octave of the West, some discussion on the subject<br/>    of intonation is necessary.  In the classical music of North India<br/>    there is no need for equal temperament, since the factors which lead<br/>    to this -- changing harmonies and the system of keys -- do not<br/>    apply.  Moreover, the technique of tempering notes by the use of<br/>    beats is generally unknown, and since it is uncommon to find a<br/>    number of melody instruments playing together, no objective standard<br/>    of tuning is in general use.  The only Indian instrument with fixed<br/>    intonation is the harmonium which is often used for accompanying<br/>    singers, but even here the precise tuning varies with each<br/>    instrument.  In general, intonation is governed by the individual<br/>    musician&apos;s feeling for intervals.  Except for the simple consonances<br/>    of the ground-note, octave, fifth and fourth, these only approximate<br/>    to a twelve semitone standard.  Electronic analysis has confirmed<br/>    that there is variation in intonation from one musician to another,<br/>    as well as for a single musician during the course of a performance.<br/>    [1]<br/>        Apart from this unconscious variation in intonation, there are<br/>    musical traditions in North India which consciously recognise that<br/>    in a few particular /raags/ one or two notes are flatter or sharper<br/>    than that which they conceive of as the standard in the /raags/ as a<br/>    whole.  <a href="http://Bhaatkha.n.de">Bhaatkha.n.de</a> refers to these traditions on a number of<br/>    occasions; for instance, when discussing the /raag Aasaavrii/ he<br/>    says, &apos;Some say that the Dha (VI) of /Aasaavrii/ is flatter than<br/>    that of the /raag Bhairavii/&apos;.  However, he does not appear to give<br/>    much credence to this and prefers not to go further into the matter.</p><p>    [CJC: There follows an interesting, amusing, and lengthy footnote on<br/>          what more <a href="http://Bhaatkha.n.de">Bhaatkha.n.de</a> actually did write about varying<br/>          intervals in Hindustani classical music, but I am leaving that<br/>          out in the hopes of tempting you to go buy Jairazbhoy&apos;s book.<br/>          Besides, I am tired. :-) ]</p><p>    --------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    [1] For further discussion on intonation, see N. A. Jairazbhoy and<br/>        A. W. Stone, &apos;Intonation in present-day North Indian classical<br/>        music&apos;, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies,<br/>        Vol. XXVI, Part 1, 1963, pp. 119-32.</p><p>    ====================================================================</p><p>    (p. 35)</p><p>        In the introductory chapter we have already suggested that the<br/>    /shruti/, which was the basis of distinction between two parent<br/>    scales in ancient India, had certainly lost its original<br/>    significance by the 17th century.  In modern times certian<br/>    musicologists and musicians still attempt to apply the old<br/>    twenty-two /shruti/ system to present-day music, while others go so<br/>    far as to assert that the present-day gamut can only be explained in<br/>    terms of forty-nine or even sixty-six different intervals.  The fact<br/>    remains that /shrutis/ are no longer functional, that is they are<br/>    not a primary basis of distinction between /raags/.</p><p>    ====================================================================</p><p>    (pp. 70-71)</p><p>        A fundamental question arises out of the foregoing discussion.<br/>    How can we recognise and appreciate a /raag/ when the dynamic<br/>    function of its notes is variable?  The only explanation which<br/>    appears to fit this condition is that the mind has considerable<br/>    latitude in the comprehension of musical intervals.  This is borne<br/>    out by the fact that in Indian music the precise intonation of notes<br/>    also varies from performer to performer, from recital to recital and<br/>    even within the same recital, [1] and yet the /raag/ being performed<br/>    is clearly recognized by the audience.  Perhaps the best way to<br/>    understand this is in terms of an analogy.  Let us imagine that the<br/>    consonance-dissonance graphs represent the terrain on which we are<br/>    walking.  As we walk down from a peak into a valley, at a certain<br/>    point we suddenly recognise the valley and can say this is Dha [CJC:<br/>    sixth] or this is Ga [CJC: third].  The point of lowest potential<br/>    energy of this valley is at its bottom, but recognition dawns<br/>    somewhere on the slopes.  The analogy must now be carried into three<br/>    dimensions if we are to convey the dynamic function of the notes, as<br/>    the particular valley we are concerned with may be located in the<br/>    mountains, and a river in this valley will run into a lower valley<br/>    and continue downwards until it finally reaches the ocean.  In two<br/>    dimensions the bottom of the valley appears to be a state of minimum<br/>    potential energy; in three dimensions, however, it is seen that the<br/>    bottom of the valley is itself sloping towards a lower valley.  The<br/>    incline is less steep in the valley than on the slopes, thus the<br/>    kinetic energy, which can be correlated with the dynamic function of<br/>    the notes, is lower in the valley than on the slopes.  Would a<br/>    musician necessarily choose the point of lowest kinetic energy when<br/>    he wishes to convey suspense, anticipation or tension?  It has been<br/>    noted that the leading note (Ni) is often sharper in ascent than in<br/>    descent.  Is not this sharpening of the Ni a subconscious device to<br/>    increase its dynamic value so that it more urgently demands<br/>    resolution on the tonic (Sa)?<br/>        To summarise, music is concerned, from one viewpoint, with<br/>    states of tension and release, with contrasts of energy levels.<br/>    Where the musician wishes to convey the feeling of relief from<br/>    tension, he must seek the bottom of the valley, and particularly<br/>    those valleys which have a low potential energy level, in other<br/>    words the more consonant notes.  When he aims to convey tension,<br/>    however, he would not necessarily seek the /bottom/ of the valley of<br/>    the less consonant notes.  Yet he cannot stray too far up the slope,<br/>    else the note would sound disturbingly out of tune.</p><p>    --------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    [1] Jairazbhoy here again cites the following work (specifically pp.<br/>        130-131):</p><p>            Jairazbhoy, N.
