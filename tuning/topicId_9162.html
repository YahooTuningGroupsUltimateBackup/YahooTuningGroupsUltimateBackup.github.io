The marks are<br/>placed at integer multiples of some fixed spacing. (Thus mark<br/>positions are usually referred to by integer values with 0 being the<br/>leftmost.) The objective is to achieve as many distinct measurement<br/>distances between marks as is possible with the given number of marks.<br/>Thus these marks must be located very efficiently, so that we avoid<br/>redundant distances between marks - ie., the distance from any mark to<br/>any other mark must be a unique distance for the ruler. Sample: marks<br/>at 0-1-2-3 would not be very efficient, since three pairs are<br/>separated by the distance 1. You could only measure the distances of<br/>1,2, and 3 with this ruler. This is not a Golomb Ruler.<br/>A sample Golomb Ruler with 4 marks is 0-1-3-7. It can measure six<br/>different lengths: 1,2,3,4,6, and 7. See how no distance is measured<br/>twice? Now, what we really want are Optimal Golomb Rulers (OGR&apos;s).<br/>These are the shortest golomb rulers for a given number of marks. For<br/>instance, for 4 marks, the OGR is 0-1-4-6, which measures six<br/>distances (1,2,3,4,5,6) but is as short as possible (6 &quot;units&quot; in<br/>length).&quot;</p><p>Here are some OGR&apos;s based on the octave (or choose any other interval<br/>or mode):<br/>5:<br/> 70.5882 282.3529 705.8823 847.0588 2/1<br/>6:<br/> 48.0000 192.0000 480.0000 864.0000 1104.0000 2/1<br/>7:<br/> 35.2941 141.1765 317.6471 529.4118 776.4706 1129.4118 2/1<br/>8:<br/> 27.2727 136.3636 327.2727 681.8182 736.3636 954.5455 1118.1818 2/1<br/>9:<br/> 21.818 130.901 218.182 501.818 567.273 741.818 894.545 1156.364 2/1<br/>10:<br/> 16.667 66.667 216.667 466.667 550.0 783.333 900.0 1066.667 1166.667 2/1</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2004 4:32:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Jon,</p><p>&gt; Just be sure to stick a &quot;my preciousssss&quot; in there somewhere. :)</p><p>:)</p><p>Here are a few more sound clips from recent debugging btw,<br/>all in harmonic timbres made using various functions,<br/>and using the Karplus Strong decay:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/brassy_5o4_11o8_7o4_2o1.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/brassy_5o4_11o8_7o4_2o1.mp3</a></p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11_plucked.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11_plucked.mp3</a></p><p>(xu11 there means x^11 because that is what I used as<br/>half wave shape to make a rounded saw tooth).</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11.mp3</a></p><p>Same notes, but each partial swells and fades and they all<br/>melt into each other - at the mid point it consists of superimposed<br/>rounded saw tooth curves for all the 1st 16 harmonics simultaneously.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2004 4:44:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Here are a few more sound clips from recent debugging btw,<br/>&gt;all in harmonic timbres made using various functions,<br/>&gt;and using the Karplus Strong decay:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/brassy_5o4_11o8_7o4_2o1.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/brassy_5o4_11o8_7o4_2o1.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11_plucked.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11_plucked.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(xu11 there means x^11 because that is what I used as<br/>&gt;half wave shape to make a rounded saw tooth).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/harmonics_to_16_xu11.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Same notes, but each partial swells and fades and they all<br/>&gt;melt into each other - at the mid point it consists of superimposed<br/>&gt;rounded saw tooth curves for all the 1st 16 harmonics simultaneously.</p><p>Hey, these sound really cool!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
