The problem is with the Steinway&apos;s<br/>rental policy in the New York area.  I&apos;ve heard Steinways retuned<br/>beautifully: in fact, at Pomona College a pair of pre-war instruments were<br/>used for the Ives quartertone pieces, and later, a single instrument was<br/>tuned to the 11-limit just tuning (or, as close as you can come to Just with<br/>a piano) for Leedy&apos;s extraordinary _Pastorale_ for chorus and piano four<br/>hands.  However, the most beautiful quartertone pair I&apos;ve encountered was in<br/>Krems, Austria with a pair of B&#xFFFD;sendorfers. Adam Silverman probably remembers<br/>those two as well...</p></div><h3><a id=6286 href="#6286">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/17/1999 4:02:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Of course, I for one, am now curious about Krems.  Have you considered Daniel<br/>that the Pomona tunings were based on a &quot;pure&quot; quartertone tone between them,<br/>but with an A higher than 440?  It would seem quite possible.  Holding pitch<br/>otherwise on a Steinway is not in question.</p><p>An interesting historic note about an AFMM concert performance of the Ives &quot;3<br/>Quarter-Tone Pieces&quot; is that we had a piano tuner who was convinced that a<br/>particular piano would rise up about 10 cents from 2 P.M. until 9 P.M. which<br/>is when it was to be heard.</p><p>It never rose.  Dorothy Jonas&apos; perfect pitch was enraged and she fought to go<br/>on with the concert...she had reconciled herself to exact quartertones, but<br/>this was somehing else.  Instead of an 11-relationship we had, effectively, a<br/>13-relationship.  There was 60 cent difference between the two pianos, and<br/>the effect...once liberated by previous expectations was tremendous.</p><p>There was a greater definition in the valley between the two pianos.  The<br/>harmonies between them were certainly as interesting, and upon reflection,<br/>more interesting.  More harmonious with the 13 implications.</p><p>There is an interesting story in the Memos about Ives coming upon an<br/>out-of-tune piano that charmed so much he returned to it on another day to<br/>recapure its intervallic pedigree, but alas, it was lost to him.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
