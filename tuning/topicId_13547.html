The major 3rd in 19 is about 379 cents, putting it<br/>about 7cents lower than the 5/4 (and closer then the 12eq 3rd)...the<br/>minor 3rd is almost perfect at 316 cents (rounded off). The 5th is 695<br/>cents, and it definitely sound a bit flatter than I like it in chords.<br/>The good thing about notes flatter than the pure harmonic is that you<br/>can bend into them if you want (on a guitar, anyway) . In 31, I believe<br/>the 3rd is at 387 cents, making it, for all practical purposes, perfect<br/>with the 5/4...the minor 3rd is about 310 cents, making it 10 cents<br/>closer to the 5/6 than 12 eq...the 5th is about 396 cents, again making<br/>for a somewhat off sounding 5th. I have found, as my ear has gotten<br/>better over the years, that the flat 5th of 19 and 31 (more in 19) does<br/>bug me...the trade off is the better 3rds/6ths, which overall is worth<br/>it. Of course, all eqs are &quot;out of tune&quot; somewhere, so it&apos;s part of the<br/>deal...the increased number of keys for modulation, and the fascinating<br/>new chordal/melodic possibilities are what I like about these tunings.<br/>   Just for the heck of it, 34 eq is a marvelous eq...both 3rds are only<br/>2 cents sharp to pure, and the 5th is 4 cents sharp. There&apos;s also a<br/>bunch of other interesting features, such as 2 cycles of 5ths, a cycle<br/>of 34 major or minor 3rds, and the dreaded comma, which can be put to<br/>very good use with a bit of patience. I have a composition which uses<br/>the comma as a basic structural feature...it&apos;ll be on my 4th CD (which<br/>is in the works). I don&apos;t know if this helps the stretch thread, but<br/>there it is...Hstick</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I really liked the 34-tET pieces on your last CD, and<br/>have always thought that triadic music would not work in 34 (or 22) unless<br/>you used the comma as a structural feature . . . glad you&apos;ve come to agree!<br/>Before the CD comes out, care to elaborate on ways you used the comma as a<br/>structural feature? I&apos;ve used it in 22-tET (implying 7-limit harmony) within<br/>a form of micro-chromaticism, where a line moving by the 54.5-cents<br/>intervals of 22-tET can be harmonized in such a way that when analyzed in<br/>JI, it&apos;s moving by various intervals like 48:49, 64:63, 256:243, and of<br/>course 80:81 -- but unlike JI, you get a smoother line, since all the steps<br/>are in JI . . . have you used a similar approach in 34, something different,<br/>all of the above . . . ? Or shall it remain a secret until the CD comes out?</p></div><h3>Paul H.

It helps to get your perspective on<br/>these alternate ETs, especially since you&apos;re coming from more of a<br/>jazz background.  So I take it that on your 31t-ET guitar you tune<br/>your open strings to straight 31t-ET, rather than tuning your highest<br/>strings slightly sharp and your lowest slightly flat?</p><p>&gt;    Just for the heck of it, 34 eq is a marvelous eq...both 3rds are<br/>only<br/>&gt; 2 cents sharp to pure, and the 5th is 4 cents sharp.
