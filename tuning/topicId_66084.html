I have more than once used them as a starting point of looking how to condense the most material with the most limited resources. usually with good results ( and interesting and musically valuable) but not the optimal.</p><p>One of the features of the Eikosany is the structure itself which when used allows all forms of cross relations and a consistent set of relationships. One example is how the opposite tones will function harmonically in the inverted functions<br/>Once you change some of the dissonances to consonances, these become less important, or not exsistent relationships.<br/>the Eikosany already has inherent in it at this factor level such problems.</p><p>Take the 1-3-5-9 hexanies .<br/>taken solely by themselves,  the cross relations  are so consonant that it is impossible to hear it as a hexany unless one uses other means, that one does not usually bother.<br/>It requires a certain dissonance between the farthest points otherwise one has problems hearing it.</p><p>It seems once you have nullified the structure, you want to just go forward with changing intervals how you want as i can no longer see why one would be obliged to concern oneself with the eikosany. Since it is not concerned in concept with to have the most consonances with the least amount of tones, possibly tinkering with the intervals might come up with a better result in what you are actually interested in.<br/>The inaccuracy of the basic guitar is such that one can easily entertain such small tolerances</p><p> &gt; Message: 18        &gt;    Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2006 05:02:41 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@bigpond.net.au">d.keenan@bigpond.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: A combination-product-set guitar (part 1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those of you who don&apos;t read MakeMicroMusic, I&apos;ve posted there an &gt; edited version of an email conversation that Pete McRae and I had a &gt; year ago.
