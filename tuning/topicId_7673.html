There ~is~ the idea of a play-by-wire piano, where scaling isn&apos;t<br/>necessary.  Imagine calling a normal piano a &quot;tracker&quot; piano. :)</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d love to know more about Norman Henry&apos;s instruments: a 33-tone keyboard<br/>&gt;is 3/2 larger than anything I&apos;ve attempted!</p><p>It&apos;s a double-strung fortepiano with three 2:1&apos;s of range.  The scale is a<br/>Partchian tonality diamond on the set [1 3 5 7 9 11 15], which is just the<br/>15-limit diamond with ratios of 13 removed.  The keyboard is a graphic<br/>representation of the diamond -- just like the recent thread on the diamond<br/>marimba.  It goes sort of like this...</p><p>             / \               /\<br/>           / n   \           /  /<br/>         / o  /    \       /    \<br/>       / t    \      \   /      /<br/>      \o      /        /        \<br/>      /       \        /        /<br/>      \       \        \        \<br/>      /u      /        /        /<br/>      \  t    \        \        \<br/>      /    o  /        /        /<br/>      \      n  \      \      /<br/>      /     /     \    /    /   ^<br/>      \   /   ^     \  \  /     |<br/>       \/     |       \ /      8/1<br/>             2/1<br/>      1/1             4/1</p><p>The vertical zig-zag lines are columns of 1/1&apos;s.  Otonalities go up and to<br/>the right; utonalities down to the left.  Please excuse this asci diagram,<br/>which is severely compressed along the x-axis.  The real keyboard is spread<br/>out quite a bit.  The keys themselves are round, topped with opaque colored<br/>plexiglass.  Each key is two-toned, and each identity has a color<br/>associated with it.  So if you want to play a 5 utonality, you&apos;d stick to<br/>keys that were green (say) on the top half.  Some keys, such as those<br/>within a column of 1/1&apos;s, share strings (are mounted on the same lever).<br/>The variation in force and travel distance amongst such keys is yet to be<br/>tested.  Henry&apos;s 1974 harpsichord (based on the 29-note 11-limit diamond)<br/>is of very similar design, and the lever-sharing turned out not to be much<br/>of a problem.  But the greater mass of a piano action may change things. . . .</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7737 href="#7737">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;caccola@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2000 7:30:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(Carl:)</p><p>&gt; Haven&apos;t the costs of such a project gone down, like the cost of<br/>&gt; everything else?<br/>&gt;<br/>If anything, I think they&apos;ve risen.
