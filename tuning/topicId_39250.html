I&apos;d be grateful if you could post any<br/>&gt; that you think might be of interest and I&apos;ll try to include them.<br/>&gt; Thanks.</p><p>Well, my main sites are:</p><p><a href="http://musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk">http://musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk</a> (fractal and microtonal things)</p><p>Download page for my programs (windows only)<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a><br/>Also<br/><a href="http://robertinventor.com">http://robertinventor.com</a> (personal home page)<br/>but not particularly microtonal apart from a<br/>few clips of the fractal tunes.</p><p>My list of links to other tuning programs is at</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk/fts_download.htm">http://tunesmithy.co.uk/fts_download.htm</a><br/>and then go to Tuning Programs Links.</p><p>Our Tuning FAQ, such as it is so far, is at<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/on_site_tree/tree.html">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/on_site_tree/tree.html</a><br/>- very incomplete but some good material there!</p><p>My microtonal tunes midi clips are at:<br/><a href="http://musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk/tunes/tunes.htm">http://musicandvirtualflowers.co.uk/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>and the yahoo groups lists of lists is at<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning2">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning2</a></p><p>The tuning list archive listed there isn&apos;t up and running yet really,<br/>just an old version at:<br/><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~tuning_archive/tuning/html/index.html">http://members.tripod.com/~tuning_archive/tuning/html/index.html</a><br/>and the url will certainly change as they don&apos;t have much space there<br/>and they reduced the allocation, - think it might even exceed it now,<br/>so if I remove stuff, can&apos;t put it back again.</p><p>Depends on which of those you feel your visitors are going to be most interested in.</p><p>Some also link to my page about the fractal tunes which is currently<br/>at:</p><p><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/index.htm">http://www.tunesmithy.connectfree.co.uk/index.htm</a></p><p>It will prob. get moved at some point as that is an old<br/>site. Though they still host it, I can&apos;t any more<br/>access it to maintain it. But at present that&apos;s<br/>the only place where I have that material about<br/>the fractal tunes, and the real audio and midi clips<br/>on-line.</p><p>Plus for mp3s, my .au and <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> sites:</p><p><a href="http://www.mp3.com/robert_inventor.html">http://www.mp3.com/robert_inventor.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy">http://www.mp3.com.au/fractaltunesmithy</a><br/>and<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/robertwalker">http://www.mp3.com.au/robertwalker</a></p><p>Anyway this gathers together links<br/>to all of my sites in one post if anyone<br/>is interested to... I think it is<br/>complete more or less (old mirror<br/>of the tunes page is also still up<br/>at tripod, but has adverts, and<br/>anything new will go on the new site).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
