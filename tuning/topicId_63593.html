Ati ati komal re<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given the way that most of the names group together<br/>&gt; in this tuning, i submit that this is probably the<br/>&gt; origin of the system you describe.</p><p>From a strictly theoretical point of view, what you<br/>say has some theoretical appeal, but I don&apos;t think<br/>it passes &quot;Occam&apos;s Razor&quot;.  Why force the system into<br/>a 3-limit paradigm when there is no such bias among<br/>Indian musicians, either historically or in the present,<br/>and when the 5th harmonic is so clearly audible?<br/>Acknowledging the role of the 5th harmonic makes<br/>the whole system readily perceivable, simple and<br/>straightforward, and also just happens to correspond<br/>to what can be observed and measured in actual use,<br/>as well is what is actively taught by masters of<br/>raga to their students.</p><p>There is another point that should be mentioned which<br/>is probably stronger than either your argument or the<br/>caveat to it I have mentioned above.  The tamboura is<br/>the principal drone instrument in Indian music and most<br/>tambouras have a VERY pronounced 5th harmonic.  I have<br/>heard super-expensive concert tambouras in which the<br/>5th harmonic is so strong that it almost overwhelms the<br/>tonic!  I have sometimes found it difficult to sing a<br/>6/5 komal ga in the presence of such a strong 5/4!</p><p>With such a strong 5th harmonic audibly present in<br/>the fundamental drone from which the shrutis naturally<br/>arise, it just doesn&apos;t make sense to impose a 3-limit<br/>Pythagorean paradigm on Indian music.  In fact, the<br/>many masters of Indian music that I have had the good<br/>fortune to associate with seem to have a love affair<br/>with the 5th harmonic.  In some forty years of investigation<br/>I have yet to see the slightest empirical evidence that<br/>the Indian system is based on a 3-limit paradigm.  It just<br/>doesn&apos;t fit the observable facts.</p><p>I have seen some theoreticians to who, like you, seem<br/>to think that the Indian system is based on the 3-limit,<br/>such as Alain Danielou.  Mr. Danielou bases his conclusions on<br/>extremely limited exposure, however.  Though I&apos;m sure<br/>he was well meaning, he just didn&apos;t hear enough<br/>of the music to draw any decisive conclusions.  (He<br/>worked with a few musicians in Varanasi in the 30&apos;s and<br/>had almost no exposure to other musicians or to recordings.<br/>It&apos;s also questionable how he decided which intervals he<br/>was hearing.  As an example, Danielou claims that the<br/>third (shuddha ga) of Raga Yaman is 81/64.  In my extensive<br/>study of this raga I have yet to find a single musician who uses<br/>81/64.  They use 5/4 in all cases that I have studied.)</p><p>And, for example, why posit a 384 cent<br/>shuddha ga based on a theoretical pythagorean sequence,<br/>when the 386 cent 5/4 shuddha ga is blasting in your ear<br/>from the tamboura and forms such a prominent part of the<br/>soundscape in which Indian music is created?  Again, the<br/>Indian musicians have not the slightest bias against<br/>the 5th harmonic nor do they make any effort to avoid it.<br/>Rather, it is fully embraced.</p><p>Further, the Indian scale and indeed all of<br/>Indian music, has its root in vocal music.  It<br/>would require a rather sophisticed musical<br/>instrument to accurately generate a long chain<br/>of pythagorean intervals based on perfect fifths<br/>(or fourths).  Instead, Indian music is based<br/>on the simple relationship of each tone to the<br/>tonic (sa).</p><p>Of course tonal relationships within the scale are<br/>also significant, but secondary to the fundamental<br/>relationship with the tonic.  Again using the example<br/>of Raga Yaman.  This raga has no natural fourth<br/>(ma) but rather uses the raised fourth (tivra ma).<br/>Because of this, the 5/4 relationship usually<br/>favored in Indian music between the natural fourth<br/>(4/3) and the major sixth (shuddha dha = 5/3) is<br/>not present.  This &quot;frees up&quot; shuddha dha and in<br/>most cases musicians prefer the 27/16 shuddha dha in<br/>Yaman.  But even so, they still use the 5/4 shuddha ga<br/>even though it does not make a nice 3/2 with 27/16<br/>as it does with 5/3.  Thus, musicians place the inner<br/>relationship between shuddha ga and shuddha dha second<br/>to their sense of which tones are most desirable<br/>melodically in relation to the tonic, which is always<br/>heard in the constantly sounding drone.  In ragas that<br/>use the natural fourth (4/3) and the major sixth<br/>(shuddha dha), the preferred pitch for shuddha dha<br/>is generally 5/3.</p><p>Even such a &quot;5th harmonic phobic&quot; composer<br/>as La Monte Young embraces the 5th harmonic<br/>fully in his very advanced practice of Indian<br/>vocal music.</p><p>I am not interested in proving anything here, nor of<br/>convincing those who wish to apply a different<br/>theoretical paradigm.  I just know from<br/>experience, first hand and without any doubt,<br/>of the role of the 5th harmonic in Indian raga.<br/>Just listen to singers such as Pandit Pran<br/>Nath blend his voice seamlessly with the 5th harmonic<br/>of the tamboura drone and I think you won&apos;t have<br/>any doubts either.</p></div><h3>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2007 8:08:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear All,</p><p>It&apos;s really a shame and a pity.</p><p>Not because &quot;you were raised up in the city&quot;, if you<br/>even were, but because our sweetly detested Portal<br/>Tenders, <a href="http://Yahoo.com">Yahoo.com</a>, think that they know better than<br/>their users what their users want and need.</p><p>To wit (and please listen up Yahoo Board of<br/>Directors):</p><p>A picture is worth every iota of those well known<br/>&quot;thousand words&quot;.</p><p>I am a musical tuning theorist.

Pythagorean tuning is as old as<br/>dirt, and my hunch is that Indian tuning has precursors<br/>in the music of the Sumerians and Babylonians, whose<br/>music-theory descriptions are almost certainly &quot;pythagorean&quot;<br/>(centuries before Pythagoras, of course).</p><p>As i wrote briefly in my first post in this thread,<br/>i&apos;ve recently been working again on my hypothesis that<br/>the Greek-letter notation used by Boethius in his<br/>description of the Graeco-Roman modal system fits<br/>an extended pythagorean tuning which recognizes<br/>schismic equivalence but has pairs of pitches separated<br/>by the syntonic/pythagorean comma. The Indian system<br/>works exactly this same way.

Certainly there is a distinction between intervals<br/>derived solely from the 3rd harmonic and those derived from both the<br/>3rd and 5th harmonics.  That&apos;s the distinction we&apos;ve been discussing.</p><p>&gt; India got their tuning from !4th century Persian theory. From the<br/>mouth of a master BTW, Amiya Dusgupta.</p><p>Even if this is true it does not apply to the tunings used in Indian<br/>music today, which are derived from the drone.  Have you studied with<br/>a master of Indian vocal music?  They will invariably teach you to<br/>find the notes in the drone -- to tune your voice to the harmonics<br/>you hear in the drone -- to actually merge your voice in the drone.<br/>In real practice, this is where the notes come from.</p><p>&gt; The first shows Indian tuning in terms of the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; series. The second with it schismatic equivalents. Not all of India<br/>&gt; does things the same way. They call it a subcontinent for a reason.</p><p>These two approaches to identifying intervals are different, and<br/>thus they&apos;re not talking about the same tunings.  I have previously<br/>stated my arguments for &quot;the second&quot; being the more accurate<br/>representation of the intevals used in North Indian music today.</p><p>Perhaps I should have made it clearer that I have been talking about<br/>North Indian classical music all along.  The South Indian Carnatic<br/>melakarta system is different.  Though the book by P. SAMBMOORTHY<br/>is ostensibly about South Indian Music, he also discusses the tunings<br/>used in North Indian &quot;Hindustani&quot; music.</p><p>I admit I was too hasty in making a slight criticism of Sambmoorthy&apos;s<br/>work.  Looking at it further I think it is quite good.  Kolinski&apos;s<br/>work is indeed trash however.</p><p>&gt; The drone came later in Indian music.</p><p>All my comments have been about the system of tuning used in North<br/>Indian classical music.  I don&apos;t have too many recordings in my<br/>collection made a couple thousand years ago, nor even a couple<br/>hundred!  (Recording technology seems to have been somewhat lacking<br/>in those days!)  And the ancient Indian texts are, generously<br/>speaking, less than precise on the tuning issue.</p><p>If it is the case that &quot;the drone came later&quot; than the tuning theory<br/>you wish to discuss, then it is also probably fair to say that none<br/>of the speculated derivations of ancient tunings have even the<br/>slightest relevance to the tunings used today.  If it is true that<br/>some contrived pythagorean tunings system was used in India PRE-<br/>DRONE, then the advent of the drone would have overthrown the old<br/>tuning system completely and supplanted it with a tuning system based<br/>on the audible harmonics within the drone, which is what is used<br/>today.</p><p>So in talking about tunings used in North Indian classical music<br/>today (the topic of my disccusion) and tunings that MAY (or may not,<br/>no recordings to check!) have once anciently been used, we&apos;re talking<br/>about &quot;apples and oranges&quot;.</p><p>&gt; But there is a big variety about the theoretical tunings and the<br/>practice.</p><p>This is true, and is an area I&apos;ve avoided getting into in my<br/>discussion.  Even today the actual practice may vary significantly<br/>from any coherent theory.  One huge limitation in our discussion (and<br/>in the theory) is that the essential technique of evoking and<br/>sustaining the &quot;rasa&quot; of a given raga involves the use of all the<br/>pitches &quot;between the notes&quot;.  The pitch areas between the notes<br/>comprise much of the actual Indian music heard in performance.  The<br/>svaras (notes) are the nodal points -- the points of maximum<br/>resonance -- that demarcate the broader pitch areas.  In a full<br/>performance of any raga it is almost certain that all points on the<br/>entire pitch spectrum within an octave are sounded at some point or<br/>other in the performance.</p><p>&gt; erotic ragas where you find the 7th harmonic<br/>&gt; used for instance.</p><p>The 7th harmonic doesn&apos;t figure in theory, nor in common practice,<br/>but certainly may appear in the performances of some artists who<br/>probably have no idea they they&apos;re singing notes derived from the<br/>seventh harmonic.  I don&apos;t know of any raga that uses these tones as<br/>principal notes consistently however.  The singer is permitted a<br/>great deal of freedom to use whatever tones they feel invoke the<br/>spirit of the raga, though if they get too idiosyncratic with this,<br/>other artists may feel that they have moved outside the scope of the<br/>raga.</p><p>&gt; Much of India has been only using 17 of the 22 for a<br/>&gt; while, according to this one master.</p><p>I think this is true, though I haven&apos;t pinned it down to precisely<br/>17.  It does seem like the full range of shrutis is rarely used, but<br/>of course no one is suggesting that all the shrutis are used in any<br/>one performance in any case.  The notion is that the full array of<br/>shrutis constitute the fundamental pitch palette of the entire art<br/>form, not a single performance.</p><p>If those of you interested in discussing this topic are primarily<br/>interested in what you believe might be the ancient origins of scales<br/>once used in India but which are no longer in use (perhaps since the<br/>advent of the drone?), then the discussion has moved outside the area<br/>of my knowledge and interest.  I joined the discussion to provide<br/>some information and insights about the shrutis as used in North<br/>Indian classical music today, and at least since the age of<br/>recording, and probably for at least some time before.</p><p>Because there are no recordings of the ancient music, you can<br/>speculate to your heart&apos;s content about what pitches they may have<br/>been using in actual practice, but you can never prove your points<br/>nor can anyone disprove them.  At best you can argue about what you<br/>think the ancient (rather enigmatic) texts are saying.</p><p>But if you want to understand the practice of Indian music today, I<br/>think you will have to confine yourself to considering the singable<br/>tones.  Pitches derived theoretically from long strings of compounded<br/>ratios are neither audible nor singable within the soundscape of the<br/>sa-pa drone of the tamboura and are thus outside the scope of Indian<br/>music in practice.</p><p>I think this discussion has had some value up to this point, but if<br/>it is going to degenerate into unprovable speculations about what<br/>tunings were used by ancient Indian musicians in their practice, I am<br/>no longer interested.</p><p>However, if anyone has anything of substance to add<br/>about the use of tunings in North Indian raga today, that would be<br/>interesting.  For example, can you give me an example of any<br/>recordings by any acknowledged master who uses pitches derived from<br/>the seventh harmonic as a regular part of his or her musical<br/>vocabulary?  Now that would be interesting!</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2007 11:45:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Marc,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ma1973&quot; &lt;marcsavage73@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The conclusion are the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think so.

But for me, it is exactly that, a very big deal.</p><p>Of course, JI theory states that the ratios with the<br/>smallest integers in their numerator and denominator are<br/>going to equate to the most consonant for that intervallic<br/>_gestalt_ -- thus, 2/1 = &quot;octave&quot;, 3/2 = &quot;5th&quot;, 4/3 = fourth,<br/>5/4 = &quot;major-3rd&quot;, etc.</p><p>But almost every sophisticated ancient tuning scheme i&apos;ve<br/>studied began its life as a pythagorean system, and it was<br/>only when the chain-of-5ths was extended far enough that<br/>intervals which are similar to higher-prime-limit (but<br/>lower-integer numerator and denominator) ratios were found<br/>that the theorists were willing to include those higher-prime<br/>ratios in their theoretical tuning systems.</p><p>The discovery of the pythagorean-comma, which takes notice<br/>of the near-equivalence of 3^12 and 2/1, is what led to<br/>12-edo tuning. Similarly, the discovery of the mercator-comma,<br/>where 3^53 == 2/1, led to 53-edo.</p><p>The schismatic equivalence of 3^-8 with 5/4 was made a<br/>basis of tuning and compositional practice in the 1400s,<br/>where the pythagorean Gb, Db, Ab, Eb were used as<br/>close substitutes for the 5-limit F#, C#, G#, D#; see:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/s/schismic-tuning.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/s/schismic-tuning.aspx</a></p><p>But obviously this schismatic equivalence was noticed<br/>far earlier, and this is just another case of medieval<br/>Europe emerging from the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; with knowledge that<br/>had already been in use centuries earlier but was<br/>forgotten in Europe after the Germanic migrations.</p><p>My point is that in cultures outside Europe this<br/>knowledge may not have been forgotten: India is one<br/>such place, and the &quot;Arab world&quot; via the Greek<br/>Byzantine Empire is another.</p><p>I&apos;m absolutely certain that the ancient Greek musical<br/>notation, as described by Boethius and Alypius, was<br/>based on an extended pythagorean system with schismatic<br/>equivalences. In fact, 53-edo is an excellent tuning<br/>to use for this notation; but the pythagorean tuning<br/>with the actual 3-limit ratios would work just as well<br/>in terms of what is actually audible.</p><p>And i&apos;m also certain that the Greeks did not invent this,<br/>but that they got it from either the Persians who got it<br/>from the Babylonians, or directly from the Babylonians,<br/>and that the Babylonians got it from the Sumerians.<br/>This would make it a music-theoretical idea which goes<br/>all the way back to the beginning of recorded history.<br/>And to me, that&apos;s very significant.</p><p>I&apos;ve read various accounts that state that the most<br/>ancient Indian tuning was done as an extended pythagorean<br/>system, and i see no reason to doubt it.</p><p>&gt; Your system still flunks Occam&apos;s Razor, and you also<br/>&gt; have not answered my earlier question about why you<br/>&gt; would prefer to guess that the svaras derive from<br/>&gt; highly extended compounded sequences of ratios which<br/>&gt; can neither be heard nor sung when the actual notes<br/>&gt; are right in front of you, clearly audible and singable?</p><p>I provided the answer to that question before you asked<br/>it, right in the first post i sent which had the<br/>pythagorean tuning:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/72706">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/72706</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Ignoring the skhisma (~2 cents), the set of ratios<br/>&gt;&gt; you give can mostly be tuned as a pythagorean chain<br/>&gt;&gt; by the method of &quot;tuning-by-concords&quot; (i.e., all 4ths<br/>&gt;&gt; and 5ths, easily tuned by ear), with one other interval<br/>&gt;&gt; needed to reach the three &quot;ati ati&quot; srutis, which can<br/>&gt;&gt; then also be tuning &quot;by concords&quot;.&quot;</p><p>The method of &quot;tuning-by-concords&quot; was first described<br/>explicitly by Aristoxenos (c. 350 BC), in a situation<br/>very much like this one here, where i would be<br/>&quot;the pythagoreans&quot; and you would be Aristoxenos,<br/>decrying the attempts by the pythagoreans to use their<br/>ratios to describe what every musician knows how to do<br/>by ear.</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/t/tuning-by-concords.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/t/tuning-by-concords.aspx</a></p><p>In fact, this method is essentially the one described<br/>in the Babylonian tablet &quot;UET VII 74&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://kingmixers.com/Franklin%20PDF%20files%20copy/Franklin%20Dissertation.%20PDF/UET%20774.pdf">http://kingmixers.com/Franklin%20PDF%20files%20copy/Franklin%20Dissertation.%20PDF/UET%20774.pdf</a></p><p><a href="http://members.aol.com/ricdum/morphology.htm">http://members.aol.com/ricdum/morphology.htm</a></p><p>Now i&apos;ve gone and written most of what i was going<br/>to put into my post about the Boethius Greek notation,<br/>and i haven&apos;t finished that yet.

In Bharata&apos;s text, they are the unit of measurement, and Bharata describes the two genera of Shadja Grama and Madhyama Grama in terms of sruti. Measuring units should have some objective foundation, for which the chain of fifths is a good candidate, and Kolinski gives reasons why other measurements (monochord) are unlikely. Nothing wrong with that. And no claim that rounding is forbidden, either.</p><p>As to the spirit vs. letter of old texts, do you really think the rules of Sanskrit don&apos;t follow Panini&apos;s letter?</p><p>There are good sources that the practice of Indian court music changed drastically under Persian rule, and the system you use (with names for the inflected svara) is newer still. It might be advisable to forget about the notion of sruti, or its association with the number 22, in these cases. Of course, that is not what a society proud of its cultural history does.</p><p>klaus</p><p>ma1973 schrieb:<br/>&gt;&gt; The conclusion are the same. &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think so.  Certainly there is a distinction between intervals &gt; derived solely from the 3rd harmonic and those derived from both the &gt; 3rd and 5th harmonics.  That&apos;s the distinction we&apos;ve been discussing.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; India got their tuning from !4th century Persian theory. From the &gt; mouth of a master BTW, Amiya Dusgupta. &gt; &gt; Even if this is true it does not apply to the tunings used in Indian &gt; music today, which are derived from the drone.  Have you studied with &gt; a master of Indian vocal music?  They will invariably teach you to &gt; find the notes in the drone -- to tune your voice to the harmonics &gt; you hear in the drone -- to actually merge your voice in the drone.  &gt; In real practice, this is where the notes come from.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The first shows Indian tuning in terms of the Pythagorean &gt;&gt; series. The second with it schismatic equivalents. Not all of India &gt;&gt; does things the same way. They call it a subcontinent for a reason. &gt; &gt; These two approaches to identifying intervals are different, and &gt; thus they&apos;re not talking about the same tunings.  I have previously &gt; stated my arguments for &quot;the second&quot; being the more accurate &gt; representation of the intevals used in North Indian music today.<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps I should have made it clearer that I have been talking about &gt; North Indian classical music all along.  The South Indian Carnatic &gt; melakarta system is different.  Though the book by P. SAMBMOORTHY<br/>&gt; is ostensibly about South Indian Music, he also discusses the tunings &gt; used in North Indian &quot;Hindustani&quot; music. &gt; &gt; I admit I was too hasty in making a slight criticism of Sambmoorthy&apos;s &gt; work.  Looking at it further I think it is quite good.  Kolinski&apos;s &gt; work is indeed trash however.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The drone came later in Indian music. &gt; &gt; All my comments have been about the system of tuning used in North &gt; Indian classical music.  I don&apos;t have too many recordings in my &gt; collection made a couple thousand years ago, nor even a couple &gt; hundred!  (Recording technology seems to have been somewhat lacking &gt; in those days!)  And the ancient Indian texts are, generously &gt; speaking, less than precise on the tuning issue.  &gt; &gt; If it is the case that &quot;the drone came later&quot; than the tuning theory &gt; you wish to discuss, then it is also probably fair to say that none &gt; of the speculated derivations of ancient tunings have even the &gt; slightest relevance to the tunings used today.  If it is true that &gt; some contrived pythagorean tunings system was used in India PRE-<br/>&gt; DRONE, then the advent of the drone would have overthrown the old &gt; tuning system completely and supplanted it with a tuning system based &gt; on the audible harmonics within the drone, which is what is used &gt; today.<br/>&gt; &gt; So in talking about tunings used in North Indian classical music &gt; today (the topic of my disccusion) and tunings that MAY (or may not, &gt; no recordings to check!) have once anciently been used, we&apos;re talking &gt; about &quot;apples and oranges&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; But there is a big variety about the theoretical tunings and the &gt; practice. &gt; &gt; This is true, and is an area I&apos;ve avoided getting into in my &gt; discussion.  Even today the actual practice may vary significantly &gt; from any coherent theory.  One huge limitation in our discussion (and &gt; in the theory) is that the essential technique of evoking and &gt; sustaining the &quot;rasa&quot; of a given raga involves the use of all the &gt; pitches &quot;between the notes&quot;.  The pitch areas between the notes &gt; comprise much of the actual Indian music heard in performance.  The &gt; svaras (notes) are the nodal points -- the points of maximum &gt; resonance -- that demarcate the broader pitch areas.  In a full &gt; performance of any raga it is almost certain that all points on the &gt; entire pitch spectrum within an octave are sounded at some point or &gt; other in the performance.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; erotic ragas where you find the 7th harmonic &gt;&gt; used for instance. &gt; &gt; The 7th harmonic doesn&apos;t figure in theory, nor in common practice, &gt; but certainly may appear in the performances of some artists who &gt; probably have no idea they they&apos;re singing notes derived from the &gt; seventh harmonic.  I don&apos;t know of any raga that uses these tones as &gt; principal notes consistently however.  The singer is permitted a &gt; great deal of freedom to use whatever tones they feel invoke the &gt; spirit of the raga, though if they get too idiosyncratic with this, &gt; other artists may feel that they have moved outside the scope of the &gt; raga.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Much of India has been only using 17 of the 22 for a &gt;&gt; while, according to this one master.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think this is true, though I haven&apos;t pinned it down to precisely &gt; 17.  It does seem like the full range of shrutis is rarely used, but &gt; of course no one is suggesting that all the shrutis are used in any &gt; one performance in any case.  The notion is that the full array of &gt; shrutis constitute the fundamental pitch palette of the entire art &gt; form, not a single performance.<br/>&gt; &gt; If those of you interested in discussing this topic are primarily &gt; interested in what you believe might be the ancient origins of scales &gt; once used in India but which are no longer in use (perhaps since the &gt; advent of the drone?), then the discussion has moved outside the area &gt; of my knowledge and interest.  I joined the discussion to provide &gt; some information and insights about the shrutis as used in North &gt; Indian classical music today, and at least since the age of &gt; recording, and probably for at least some time before.<br/>&gt; &gt; Because there are no recordings of the ancient music, you can &gt; speculate to your heart&apos;s content about what pitches they may have &gt; been using in actual practice, but you can never prove your points &gt; nor can anyone disprove them.  At best you can argue about what you &gt; think the ancient (rather enigmatic) texts are saying.<br/>&gt; &gt; But if you want to understand the practice of Indian music today, I &gt; think you will have to confine yourself to considering the singable &gt; tones.  Pitches derived theoretically from long strings of compounded &gt; ratios are neither audible nor singable within the soundscape of the &gt; sa-pa drone of the tamboura and are thus outside the scope of Indian &gt; music in practice.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think this discussion has had some value up to this point, but if &gt; it is going to degenerate into unprovable speculations about what &gt; tunings were used by ancient Indian musicians in their practice, I am &gt; no longer interested.  &gt; &gt; However, if anyone has anything of substance to add &gt; about the use of tunings in North Indian raga today, that would be &gt; interesting.  For example, can you give me an example of any &gt; recordings by any acknowledged master who uses pitches derived from &gt; the seventh harmonic as a regular part of his or her musical &gt; vocabulary?

I&apos;m still not sure about this,<br/>because of a discrepancy i see in two of the tetrachords,<br/>and i&apos;ve had to go back and study other descriptions of<br/>the Greek notation; right now i&apos;m working on that of<br/>Aristides Quintilianus.</p><p>Anyway, Aristoxenus recognized pretty early on that<br/>musicians were actually using all sorts of tunings for<br/>those two moveable inner notes, and he decided to chuck<br/>the whole idea of using ratios, and instead based his<br/>measurements on logarithmic divisions of a tone, and he<br/>defined &quot;tone&quot; as the difference between a &quot;4th&quot; and &quot;5th&quot;,<br/>which he said any musician could clearly hear. His method<br/>was patently empirical, attempting to provide a clear<br/>examination of pitches that were actually used by musicians.</p><p>Then many other writers followed Aristoxenus, who still<br/>wanted to use ratios, to reconcile their belief in<br/>pythagoreanism with the incontrovertible evidence which<br/>Aristoxenus provided. There is so much about this that<br/>John Chalmers was able to write an entire book on the subject:<br/>_Divisions of the Tetrachord_, now available complete here:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/chalmers/DivisionsOfTheTetrachord.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/chalmers/DivisionsOfTheTetrachord.pdf</a></p><p>The only thing i was really emphasizing to Marc was my<br/>surprising find that so many ancient musical cultures<br/>all described the oldest versions of their tunings in<br/>pythagorean terms. The fact that other links exist,<br/>such as shared versions of many various myths, shows<br/>that the Sumerian, Indus, Egyptian, and ancient Greek<br/>cultures did not develop in isolation. I find it interesting<br/>to see these connections in music also.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2007 5:08:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hstraub64@telesonique.net">hstraub64@telesonique.net</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 15 A&iuml;&iquest;&half;ustos 2007 &iuml;&iquest;&half;ar&iuml;&iquest;&half;amba 17:56<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Magic[22] as srutis</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;hstraub64@...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The paragraph above does, to me, not appear to describe a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; difference between the western and indian paradigm but rather the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; notorious &quot;theory lover&quot; vs. &quot;theory hater&quot; debate, which I keep<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; coming across again and again, inside western music as well.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Believe it or not, that is exactly what transpired in a huge Turkish<br/>&gt; &gt; Music discussion platform I took part in these recent days.

&gt; the spacing of holes on bone-flutes etc. But from the<br/>&gt; &gt; earliest written music-theory, we can see that pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning was developed as a standard means of scale-building.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s important to remember that the first steps,<br/>&gt; of tuning up an instrument don&apos;t necessarily dictate the<br/>&gt; final scale, and I see no reason why a character/mood-based<br/>&gt; tetrachordal approach, like what Ozan calls &quot;maqam&quot; music,<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t downright antedeluvian. Pure fifths do the blocking,<br/>&gt; the specific flavors are learned by ear, that kind of thing.</p><p>Yes, again i think you&apos;re right on the mark here.</p><p>The ancient Greek tetrachord theory had the _hestotes_<br/>(fixed notes) bounding the tetrachords, and these<br/>were all 4/3 and 9/8 ratios, and there was never any<br/>question about that. These equate to our modern notes<br/>A B E a b e in the GPS and A B E a d in the LPS.</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/g/gps.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/g/gps.aspx</a> &lt;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/g/gps.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/g/gps.aspx</a>&gt;</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/l/lps.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/l/lps.aspx</a> &lt;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/l/lps.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/l/lps.aspx</a>&gt;</p><p>Then the two inner notes of the tetrachords were moveable,<br/>and that&apos;s what all of the Greek tuning literature is about.</p><p>Originally, the moveable notes were certainly found by<br/>means of pythagorean tuning, and thus the diatonic genus,<br/>which later became known as the A-natural-minor scale,<br/>was tuned in pythagorean form and lasted all the way<br/>to the 1400s. The original full mathematical description<br/>of this is in Plato&apos;s _Timaeus_, but the ratios can be<br/>calculated from Philolaus&apos;s description c.450 BC, and<br/>that is the earliest description of tuning from any<br/>world culture which has clearly determined mathematics:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx</a> &lt;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/p/philolaus.aspx</a>&gt;</p><p>According to Thrasyllus, the chromatic genus could also<br/>be calculated by pythagorean means.</p><p>It&apos;s only the enharmonic genus which AFAIK was never given<br/>with pythagorean ratios, and the obvious reason for that is<br/>that you&apos;d have to extend the pythagorean system all the<br/>way to 3^24 to find an interval resembling a quarter-tone.</p><p>Then again, according to what i seem to be finding with<br/>my examination of Boethius&apos;s description of Greek notation,<br/>it&apos;s possible that the &quot;diesis&quot; (i.e., &quot;quarter-tone&quot;) of<br/>the enharmonic genus might actually have been a type of<br/>comma, either pythagorean or syntonic, and thus really<br/>more like an eighth-tone. I&apos;m still not sure about this,<br/>because of a discrepancy i see in two of the tetrachords,<br/>and i&apos;ve had to go back and study other descriptions of<br/>the Greek notation; right now i&apos;m working on that of<br/>Aristides Quintilianus.</p><p>Anyway, Aristoxenus recognized pretty early on that<br/>musicians were actually using all sorts of tunings for<br/>those two moveable inner notes, and he decided to chuck<br/>the whole idea of using ratios, and instead based his<br/>measurements on logarithmic divisions of a tone, and he<br/>defined &quot;tone&quot; as the difference between a &quot;4th&quot; and &quot;5th&quot;,<br/>which he said any musician could clearly hear. His method<br/>was patently empirical, attempting to provide a clear<br/>examination of pitches that were actually used by musicians.</p><p>Then many other writers followed Aristoxenus, who still<br/>wanted to use ratios, to reconcile their belief in<br/>pythagoreanism with the incontrovertible evidence which<br/>Aristoxenus provided. There is so much about this that<br/>John Chalmers was able to write an entire book on the subject:<br/>_Divisions of the Tetrachord_, now available complete here:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/chalmers/DivisionsOfTheTetrachord.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/chalmers/DivisionsOfTheTetrachord.pdf</a> &lt;<a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/chalmers/DivisionsOfTheTetrachord.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/chalmers/DivisionsOfTheTetrachord.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>The only thing i was really emphasizing to Marc was my<br/>surprising find that so many ancient musical cultures<br/>all described the oldest versions of their tunings in<br/>pythagorean terms. The fact that other links exist,<br/>such as shared versions of many various myths, shows<br/>that the Sumerian, Indus, Egyptian, and ancient Greek<br/>cultures did not develop in isolation. I find it interesting<br/>to see these connections in music also.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a> &lt;<a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a>&gt;<br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2007 11:37:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mohajeri Shahin&quot; &lt;shahinm@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and you will see this cultural overlap by musical instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://acousticsoftombak.googlepages.com/gobletdrumsthroughhistory">http://acousticsoftombak.googlepages.com/gobletdrumsthroughhistory</a></p><p>That&apos;s a good point.
