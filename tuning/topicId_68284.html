It is not simply 12ET and<br/>microtonal; there are myriads of tuning possibilities.</p><p>Each tuning does reveal more of itself upon repetition of the tuning in<br/>different musical contexts.  That&apos;s why I write passionately about  Bach now,<br/>after more than 25 years of personal involvement in performing and  directing Bach<br/>in with Werckmeister II tuning.  Another tuning offers  nothing new to the<br/>music, only a modern aesthetic for just intervals.  All  the evidence fits this<br/>so well, that one should be shaken at how exotic a  position this still sounds<br/>to those that have not heard it before.</p><p>And Tom is correct about what he says about getting Werckmeister from the<br/>source and what he presented.  (no reason to misrepresent Werckmeister to<br/>further modern aims.)</p><p>We might all put on extra-analyzing glasses of a sort to magnify the<br/>inconsistencies, foremost by misrepresentations of historical sources.</p><p>So, PLEASE let us resolve individually to continue to re-examine our  own<br/>biases and prejudices, and not only by accusing others of same.   ;)  Johnny</p></div>
