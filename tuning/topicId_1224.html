But they quote it as<br/>&apos;19 out of 27 where a trend could be identified&apos;. Nope! No media bias here!<br/>Nothing to see keep moving along folks!]</p><p>&gt; The dislike was especially striking in Muslim countries.</p><p>Ya think?</p><p>&gt; Large percentages of Muslim respondents in several countries said they believe<br/>  ================= ---------------------                      -------------<br/>&gt; suicide bomb attacks are a justifiable defense of Islam. This was especially<br/>  -------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; so in Lebanon, where 73 percent supported this belief.</p><p>Who prints these lies? It is obvious that they only polled the most exrteme<br/>radicals. It is simply false that the majority of muslims are crazy lunatics<br/>simply because they admitn to it during reputable surveys done by long<br/>established and credible surveyers using scientific methods. Don&apos;t confuse<br/>us with facts. A small minority of muslims are not radical and deranged<br/>psychopaths, therefore all muslims are peaceful flower children and to say<br/>otherwise such as by quoting established measured facts such as asking them<br/>directyl what they really thing and writing down the answers they give is<br/>not only unfair and racist but an insane act of bigotry! Why did not they<br/>ask them if they liked puppy dogs or kittens instead? That they asked if<br/>they lupported suicide bombings that kill thousands of innocent people shows<br/>how truly biased and unfair the media really is!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
