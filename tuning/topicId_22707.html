I have placed this new group under the<br/>category &quot;For Musicians&quot;, for obvious reasons.</p><p>Practical Microtonality:</p><p>The theme of this group is about making Microtonal Music. Microtonal<br/>Music, being that which is concerned with issues of pitch in music<br/>making, outside of the constraints epitomized by the standardized<br/>western 12 tone equal temperament tuning, pervading the world of<br/>music today. Every possible kind of Microtonal Tuning is welcome:<br/>Just Intonation, Non-Just Non-Equal, Non-12 Equal Temperaments,<br/>Xenharmonics, Xentonality, Non-Octave Tunings, Ethnic, Found and<br/>Invented scales - anything that leads toward the active creation of<br/>new works of Microtonal Music. Participants of  the &quot;Practical<br/>Microtonality&quot; group, work together here based on the powerful<br/>philosophy of the late Ivor Darreg, that: &quot;There are no bad scales&quot;.<br/>We gather here to share ideas about the *creation* of Microtonal<br/>Music, where all persons, employing all means of Microtonal Music<br/>production, both Acoustic and Electronic, are on an equal level.</p><p>The criteria for joining is that you are either actively making<br/>Microtonal Music, or else you have some serious future interest in<br/>this activity. There are no leaders here, only people who are<br/>interested in sharing their personal experience in the joyous and<br/>beautiful act of Microtonal Music creation. Compositional techniques,<br/>theoretical ideas which lead to the realization of living, breathing<br/>Microtonal Music and open sharing of actual music are the further<br/>themes of our group. People that are involved in this group are here<br/>to help, and share in our common ground, to achieve the ultimate ends<br/>of getting Microtonal Music recorded, and made available to both<br/>Microtonalists and interested listeners alike, and come together in<br/>an open spirit of sharing for all who are interested in this<br/>wonderful pursuit.</p><p>Our Motto is &quot;Keeping it Real&quot;.</p><p>You may join the Practical Microtonality group here:</p><p><a href="/practicalmicrotonality">/practicalmicrotonality</a></p><p>Very Best, and I hope to see all who are interested in this theme<br/>over there!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=22773 href="#22773">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>5/14/2001 2:49:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello friends!</p><p>I want to post a short message to say kind thanks to those that have<br/>shown depth and understanding about the formation of the Practical<br/>Microtonality group, and to those who may have feelings and opinions<br/>that are at odds with it, I offer these words of explanation, comfort<br/>and encouragement:</p><p>We didn&apos;t start the Practical Microtonality group to cause a rift<br/>here, or any kind of separation from this list. In fact, as you can<br/>see, I have remained subscribed. I still get my digests, and I still<br/>read them, and I will likely still post with about the same frequency<br/>that I have in the past. And another fact is that, all but a few<br/>(except for some who have never subscribed to this list) *still<br/>remain members here*.</p><p>This is to be seen as nothing more than and *extension* of this<br/>tuning theory list - nothing more - nothing less. We are just around<br/>the corner - and *all of us* are on Yahoo. As one wise member has<br/>pointed out today, others have did similar things in order to focus<br/>in on more specialized facets of tuning theory, and development.</p><p>The last thing I ever wanted or intended, was to cause any kind of<br/>bad feelings between anyone here. Only to do what others have done,<br/>and create and environment in which we may focus on our specialized<br/>area of microtonal music. Anyone is free to come and go as they<br/>please, and I have opted to do both. And I would like to gently say<br/>that this does not represent separation - absolutely not - by any<br/>stretch of the imagination, other than what may be manufactured in<br/>one&apos;s own mind. I have learned greatly from many here, and I&apos;m<br/>honored, blessed and deeply appreciative from the sharing that many<br/>have shown to me.</p><p>One thing I would greatly like to clarify, is that this Practical<br/>Microtonality group, is not *my* group. This is something that many<br/>have long had a desire to have, and again is to be seen as nothing<br/>more than an extension of this list, where we may focus on our<br/>specialized area of microtonality, without having to break to flow of<br/>important activity here. It is the group for *all* who join it, who<br/>enjoy the focus on the theme of its specialized topic, and it will be<br/>made what it will be from the content that all of them provide there.<br/>So *my* list, it is not.</p><p>If I have in any way whatsoever offended or confused persons as to my<br/>intent, I wish to openly and public offer you my humblest apologies,<br/>and offer to you, that you may write to me privately about your<br/>concerns and I&apos;ll be happy to clarify - but truth is, I&apos;m saying it<br/>here - there is no ambiguity in my words. There was a specialized<br/>need to be filled, and I&apos;m not the only one with this special need.</p><p>Eternal friend of the Tuning List,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; Dearest friends on the Alternative Tuning Theory List,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Today, I have started a new Yahoo group called Practical<br/>&gt; Microtonality, and any and all who are interested in the below<br/>&gt; description are welcome to join this open forum which promises to<br/>be<br/>&gt; quite allot of fun!

But, hope<br/>we continue to make sure there is _a_ list where everyone can<br/>meet and share things and work on things together.</p><p>Some of us will be travelling over mountain ranges and visiting<br/>strange and unusual countries there. But there will be traders<br/>and caravan routes, and people coming back as well who<br/>would never have visited the tuning list as their first<br/>microtonal stopping point.</p><p>Could be mathematicians from a mathematical list who would have<br/>found the TL to have not quite enough mathematical content to<br/>their tastes - may seem mathematical to us, but there is not so<br/>much in the way of theorems and proofs - a mathematical list<br/>might have many more in the way of Pierre Lamonthe&apos;s posts,<br/>and others on the list able to read and understand them<br/>readily.</p><p>Could be composers from the practicalmicrotonality list<br/>we have already, who find their creativity needs a<br/>forum in which they can say things that are more poetic<br/>and in the realm of imagination and so forth - such<br/>things can be said on the TL of course, and are, but it<br/>is nice to have a list where that can go on in an<br/>unrestrained fashion.</p><p>Could be programmers from programming lists for that matter,<br/>trying to figure out best ways of programming for microtonal<br/>music.</p><p>Or theorists working on the theory of the theory of the theory<br/>of microtonal music, to as many realms of abstraction as they<br/>like.</p><p>Or a lattice group maybe, devoted entirely to musical geometry.</p><p>I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll all be the richer for this when it happens, in<br/>it&apos;s own time.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=23216 href="#23216">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/19/2001 10:12:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22707.html#22936">/tuning/topicId_22707.html#22936</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It saddens me to become a source of strife for some, and it is not<br/>my intention to cause divisions amongst our ranks.

The group was<br/>off-line for a while because of something at Yahoo&apos;s end,<br/>and couldn&apos;t be accessed by anyone.
