Ta-da, a ratio gives you quantity and position of the first coincident harmonic partials as well, and tells you all the rest to infinity if you&apos;re up to reckoning them. Irrationals? No problem, you can write them out to whatever, say 4 decimal places, and compare them with the harmonic series, tells you all kinds of things too, like where the beats are going to be most audible.</p><p>Continuing with this example it is clear that without other information, for all you know these two lists of number could actually just be decribing higher harmonics of a tone at 25 Hz, or 5Hz, or 1Hz (and right there you have the clue to the scale you just posted and what you were saying about it).</p><p>Does this seem too elementary? I don&apos;t think so at all. It&apos;s more like the truly advanced approach. And a monochord- just rip the frets out of a cheap acoustic guitar like I did and you&apos;ve got a fine monochord. The back edge of a heavy butter-knife makes a good and surprisingly precise slide.</p><p>Well that&apos;s my opinion.</p></div><h3><a id=83638 href="#83638">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2009 4:12:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW, to correct myself my example is simply a higher part harmonic series with certain tones removed.<br/>&nbsp; It&apos;s obviously nothing advanced...and a side point would be that you can add irrational numbers to each other IE 1.05946 and keep adding the decimal part it to itself to get 1.11892,&nbsp; 1.17838, etc. ....and it will still sound good.&nbsp; 1.1111 was a lousy number to pick for my example as it simply equals 10/9...the 10th harmonic of the harmonic series.&nbsp; That really would be a stretched harmonic series, gets close to the point I am aiming for about the possibility of ear viewing tones as additive.&nbsp; Or, to make it more obvious, try something like the scale 1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0 where there exists 3/2 proportions between the differences between consecutive tones instead of 1/1 proportions.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And a monochord- just rip the frets out of a cheap acoustic guitar like I did and you&apos;ve got a fine monochord.&quot;<br/>???<br/>Huh?&nbsp; Here I have no clue what you are talking about....unless it&apos;s just intentional sarcasm.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
