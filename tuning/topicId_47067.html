Partch actually uses JI to<br/>approximate spoken language.  In the Li Po song, &quot;In the springtime on the<br/>southside of the Yangzee Kiang, Partch employs plus and minus signs next to the<br/>ratios.  The ratios are the closest set for capturing to spoken vernacular<br/>that Partch wants to express authoratively ( or at least as accurately as he<br/>can).</p><p>&gt; For future reference, if you are going to rain contempt on someone for<br/>&gt; saying something you don&apos;t agree with, you should wait until you know<br/>&gt; what it is they said. It also helps to give a direct answer to a<br/>&gt; direct question, and here is the answer to yours:</p><p>Actually, this issue was a sidebar concern.  I have been corrected in that I<br/>thought you were using a fancy name for Ted Mook&apos;s practice.  You were<br/>speaking of a theoretical possibility and I was anchored in practice.  There is no<br/>contempt intended here, certainly not on the personal level.</p><p> &gt; How well are you going to be able to use beats, during a performance<br/>&gt; of Partch&apos;s music, to determine that something is off from 11/9 by a<br/>&gt; third of a cent?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Frankly, I never use beats to tune Partch.  I measure melodically.  And I<br/>doubt if a third of a cent...so I concur.</p><p>&gt; I will ask that you treat me with more respect that you did.</p><p>I&apos;m sure we should all be more respectful to each other.  What&apos;s more we<br/>should all recognize the special abilities and interests of each of the List&apos;s<br/>correspondents.  Somehow, there needs to be a stronger place here for musicians<br/>to &quot;try&quot; to explain what they are doing, even if the scientist&apos;s on the list<br/>want &quot;proof.&quot;</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=47080 href="#47080">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2003 5:38:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sure we should all be more respectful to each other.
