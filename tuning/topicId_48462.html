Of course I&apos;m aware that one of the chief<br/>advantages of Just Intonation is its relationship to the human<br/>auditory system. But music is not tuning, and it&apos;s my belief that<br/>other contextually relevant factors shouldn&apos;t be ignored. For<br/>example, is it not true that our ancient ancestors cut holes in<br/>flutes based not only on how they sounded but also on how well they<br/>fit the hole-cutter&apos;s hands? If so, then one only need extrapolate a<br/>bit to realize that it&apos;s probably misleading to assume that tuning is<br/>simply a byproduct of human physiology... perhaps blind obedience<br/>intermeshes with context-specific circumstances to produce a multi-<br/>tiered model too nebulous to properly consider? The only sure bet is<br/>that no one can say for sure (even those who do).</p><p>It&apos;s my personal opinion that the tuning community&apos;s use of the term<br/>equal temperament is, generally speaking, an outmoded one. It&apos;s the<br/>21st century, and when it comes to tuning systems the only limits are<br/>our technology, our tastes, and our imaginations. But for the moment,<br/>I&apos;ll attempt to put aesthetics and ideologies to the side and I&apos;ll do<br/>my best to sheath my opinions.</p><p>One of the recurrent debates regarding the term equal temperament is<br/>how does one align it with obstinate tunings such as 11, 13 and 20;<br/>equal tunings that are generally used with little regard for whatever<br/>rational tuning they might be said to approximate. In the past I used<br/>the acronym E.D.O. in an attempt to philosophically<br/>differentiate &quot;equidistant divisions of the octave&quot; from the T in ET<br/>temperament. Unfortunately, as I became interested in more and more<br/>exotic tunings (specifically equal tunings that forego the octave as<br/>their means of periodicity), EDO was not quite generalized enough,<br/>and the augmented alternatives seemed too cumbersome for my tastes...<br/>if nothing else, an acronym should be sexy and somewhat self-<br/>perpetuating!</p><p>The solution I&apos;m presently considering came about as a result of<br/>realizing that if one were to bend n-overtone series and n-undertone<br/>series towards each other, then one could arrive at a rational series<br/>that closely approximates the corresponding n-equal temperament:</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/japplets/uo_non_oct_scale_tree.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/japplets/uo_non_oct_scale_tree.htm</a></p><p>So my proposal would simply be to allow the term equal temperament to<br/>encompass the idea that n-equal temperaments are at their most basic<br/>assumption a sort of generalized meani.e., temperamentof their<br/>corresponding n-overtone series and n-undertone series.</p><p>Hopefully this sort of a paradigm shift could help dislodge ET from<br/>the superannuated confines of 12-tone equal temperament as well as<br/>generalize periodicity as it relates to ETs. And if I could be so<br/>bold as to intentionally reintroduce my personal ideology and<br/>aesthetics into the argument, then it would be my sincere hope that<br/>this process might also place generalized ETs firmly in the<br/>over/under context of series thereby liberating them of years of Just-<br/>centric suspicion.</p><p>Tvoj oddany rojko</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2003 2:26:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s my personal opinion that the tuning community&apos;s use of the<br/>term<br/>&gt; equal temperament is, generally speaking, an outmoded one.</p><p>Some of us use et to mean something which has an enforced<br/>consistency, becuase it uses a single &quot;val&quot;, or mapping of primes to<br/>steps of the et.</p><p>&gt; The solution I&apos;m presently considering came about as a result of<br/>&gt; realizing that if one were to bend n-overtone series and n-<br/>undertone<br/>&gt; series towards each other, then one could arrive at a rational<br/>series<br/>&gt; that closely approximates the corresponding n-equal temperament:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/japplets/uo_non_oct_scale_tree.htm">http://tunesmithy.netfirms.com/japplets/uo_non_oct_scale_tree.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So my proposal would simply be to allow the term equal temperament<br/>to<br/>&gt; encompass the idea that n-equal temperaments are at their most<br/>basic<br/>&gt; assumption a sort of generalized meani.e., temperamentof their<br/>&gt; corresponding n-overtone series and n-undertone series.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what this means or how to use the web page, but it<br/>sounds interesting.
