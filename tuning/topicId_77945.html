In fact, one<br/>&gt; of the works is scored for 16 sound icons!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have been hesitant to include this installment in the AGP<br/>&gt; because the LP is nominally in print on Edition RZ. However,<br/>&gt; Forced Exposure no longer includes it in their catalog, and the<br/>&gt; vast majority of people wouldn&apos;t be able to use an LP copy anyway.<br/>&gt; If anyone at Edition RZ comes across this and objects to a transcription<br/>&gt; being included in the AGP, I do hope they will contact me through the<br/>&gt; AGP website and let me know so I can remove it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you have a decent analog rig and you like this installment, I strongly<br/>&gt; encourage you to seek out a copy of the LP, as the complex percussive<br/>&gt; sounds of the sound icons lose their edge in being digitized at &gt; 16-bit/44-kHz.<br/>&gt; Also, I encourage everyone to check out the other excellent music &gt; published<br/>&gt; by Edition RZ and distributed through Forced Exposure. There are both &gt; LPs and CDs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Check it out at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4288462">http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4288462</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Enjoy!</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a></p></div>
