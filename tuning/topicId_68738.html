Unfortunately, it is still<br/>an AutoCAD based plugin, but down the road I&apos;m planning on rebuilding<br/>it for Blender which is open-source and free!</p><p>I&apos;m still spending the lion&apos;s share of my time writing code but did<br/>manage to get some experimental sounds out over the summer, which can<br/>be heard at <a href="http://www.audiosculptures.com">http://www.audiosculptures.com</a>.  They&apos;re not &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>per-se but I find them interesting none-the-less.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping to have MusiCAD buttoned up, documented, and uploaded to<br/>Sourceforge by the first of the year.  I&apos;ll keep you posted.</p><p>&apos;Til then,<br/>Regards,<br/>Andy Fillebrown</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey Andy!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I only just learnt of your post earlier this year.
