The Platonic answer<br/>is given first. This, however, leads to &quot;experiential&quot; or<br/>&quot;phenomenological&quot; reasoning (following Boethius) about the correspondence<br/>of specific ratios with specific intervals. The master argues that &quot;...<br/>given number or line, nothing is easier to recognize with the eye or reason<br/>than its double, as, for example, 12 to 6 ... And because the recognition<br/>of the duple is easier, it is justly assigned to that consonance which is<br/>easier and which our critical faculty perceives more clearly ... the<br/>diapason.&quot; (p. 82) Following this the &quot;practical&quot; argument of tones<br/>produced by different string lengths is presented.</p></div>
