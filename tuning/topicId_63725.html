While there has indeed been a massive admixture of islamicate traditions into Hindustani music, and that admixture is an important factor in distinguishing it from parallel traditions sharing a common Indic ancestry (Karnatic, Sri Lankan among them), it is a bit like calling English a Romance language because of the massive French lexicon in English.  My hesitancy becomes a real caution when I note that such a lumping can go the other way as well: one might as well include all of the &quot;Maqam Music&quot; repertoires listed above (with North African, Andalusian/Iberian, Greek, Armenian, Coptic, Arab-Orthodox and Arab-Catholic Christian, Sinti/Rom etc. thrown in for good measure) into an even broader category of &quot;Rag Music&quot;, but by a certain point one strains to hear a meaningful common denominator and the distinctions definitely become more interesting than the commonalities.</p><p>Seeking commonalities can often be diplomatically useful, but when pressed too far, one can fall into meaninglessness, or worse, banal imperialism. (On that topic, which is OT here, I&apos;ve found <a href="http://anthropik.com/">http://anthropik.com/</a> to be very interesting).</p><p>DJW</p></div>
