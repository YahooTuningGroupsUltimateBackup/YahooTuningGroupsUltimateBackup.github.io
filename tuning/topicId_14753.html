When recordingwas invented composers<br/>were given a &quot;canvas&quot; to work with a kind of stone tobe carved.  The computer will let us do<br/>that with ease. If you&apos;re going to achieve higher art, you&apos;re going to have tosculpt it just<br/>like you heard it.  People are going to want to hear it exactly like you did in your head.</p><p>&gt; I think Andrew needs to relax himself and sit down next to, say, a quartet of Renaissance<br/>&gt; singers, a cellist playing Bach or a Malian kora player, or even learn to play an instrument<br/>&gt; himself if he doesn&apos;t already. Then he needs to ask about the role of the computer in this.<br/>&gt; Limiting factor - electricity. I&apos;ve got a fully kitted out computerised midi system with a<br/>&gt; rack of analogue and digital synths and samplers but if I want to share my music with<br/>&gt; someone, I play guitar or lute or sing or bash my djembe. Late breaking news - you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to be a professional virtuoso to make good entertaining instrumental music.</p><p>And for those of you who prefer live performance over &quot;dead&quot; - you should wake up, too.</p><p>&gt; Performance is by definition live. I don&apos;t know what a dead performance is. And when I wake<br/>&gt; up I will still prefer live performance. Maybe it would be beneficial to look at the act of<br/>&gt; listening itself and to ask just what you want from music. A cheap thrill in the onanistic<br/>&gt; sense perhaps or a chance to participate in a profoundly social and spiritual human<br/>&gt; experience.</p><p>Andrew F.</p><p>note:  this was intended to incite backlash - steel sharpening steel!</p><p>No offence intended in any of my opinions.</p></div>
