In the Midwest, where I am from, a friend of<br/>mine who owns a music store used to sell acoustic pianos, some<br/>grands.  He no longer does.  All people want now is &quot;keyboards...&quot;<br/>and that pertains to 12-tET, so the idea of creating acoustic pianos<br/>to play microtonality seems currently a little off the mark...</p><p>J.

There will<br/>probably be piano makers for some time to come.  Less people wanting them is<br/>at least for a while more of a concern for sellers than it is for someone<br/>who *does* want one, though of course this will drive the price up.</p><p>Norman Henry, a guy in Oakland, has a Patchian harpsichord with 29 notes per<br/>octave - based on an 11-limit diamond.  I believe he built it himself.  He<br/>is a harpsichord tuner/technician/etc.</p><p>So the thing about harpsichords in this regard is that the required width<br/>per note for the action and strings is less than it is for the piano, so it<br/>is quite a bit easier in general to pack more notes into an octave.<br/>Bosanquet layouts with much front/back depth might pose more challenges, but<br/>if 29/octave is possible then 31/octave should be possible with the standard<br/>octave width.  I&apos;m not sure how the standard octave width fits with the<br/>expectations of Bosanquet users.</p><p>I don&apos;t know whether pianos with &gt;12 notes per octave exist, but I would<br/>certainly be interested in hearing about it.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=53054 href="#53054">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;jdrodrigues@Phreaker.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2004 1:59:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Please excuse the somewhat late response.</p><p>On Saturday, March 20, 2004, at 06:38 , <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;    Date: Fri, 19 Mar 2004 23:55:14 +0200<br/>&gt;    From: Alexandros Papadopoulos &lt;<a href="mailto:Alexmoog@otenet.gr">Alexmoog@otenet.gr</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: microtonal piano(don&apos;t be excited!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello all<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lets say that in the future people finally accept that 12ET is not the<br/>&gt; best system .<br/>&gt; Do you think that it is possible for a microtonal piano to be build<br/>&gt; (maybe with a Bosanquet keyboard) considering the number of strings ,<br/>&gt; tension and size implicated ?<br/>&gt; I am asking for your insight because I don&apos;t know much about piano<br/>&gt; technical matters .<br/>&gt; I see that many people use piano samples and MIDI controllers to do<br/>&gt; that , but I think all pianists working with microtonality have dreams<br/>&gt; of playing an acoustic one!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks</p><p>2 things I happened upon after reading your post :<br/>---</p><p>De: American Music Center [<a href="mailto:center@amc.net">mailto:center@amc.net</a>]<br/>Enviada em: quarta-feira, 1 de outubro de 2003 17:17<br/>Para: <a href="mailto:cdmusica@unicamp.br">cdmusica@unicamp.br</a><br/>Assunto: October NewMusicBox Online Now!</p><p>There are over 10 million pianos in the United States.
