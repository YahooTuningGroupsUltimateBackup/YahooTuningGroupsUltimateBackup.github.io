However my program can&apos;t download them automatically<br/>any more since the yahoogroups changes, so I would need to download each<br/>one by hand. The posts in the digests don&apos;t have message numbers so they<br/>can take a while to locate on-line and then there would be maybe forty or fifty or so<br/>messages to download individually (depending how many are in each one).</p><p>It would save me a fair amount of work if perchance someone has the digests<br/>and can send them to me, then all I do is to save them into the source folder<br/>that my program uses to make the archive and it&apos;s done.</p><p>If not, I&apos;ll probably just leave them out for now, and possibly add them in<br/>at some later date by looking them up and downloading them by hand.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
