There are of course contexts where just intonations end up as special cases of things that loosely get called temperaments.<br/>Note that you might tune a just intonation in a capricious way so that it stops being just and it still belongs to the loose category of temperaments. Note also that Vicentino&apos;s second tuning is sometimes called o temperament. Not only does it have all five limit intervals just but it is also contorted so it fails certain definitions of regular temperament two ways.<br/>In general it&apos;s best to avoid calling just intonations temperaments. It&apos;s also dull to correct somebody who does otherwise and clearly knows what they&apos;re doing</p><p>Graham</p><p>------Original message------<br/>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Date: Saturday, February 11, 2012 1:18:14 PM GMT-0500<br/>Subject: [tuning] What&apos;s the best way to describe JI&apos;s relation to temperaments?</p><p>I was giving a high-level overview of regular temperaments on XA,<br/>where I described all temperaments as deriving from JI, which I said<br/>was like &quot;the almighty super-temperament that all mere mortal<br/>temperaments are derived from.&quot; I should have thought this was clear<br/>enough, but as you might expect, someone messaged me offlist telling<br/>me that JI isn&apos;t a temperament.</p><p>Our definitions have typically treated temperaments as abstract<br/>mathematical objects of which JI is itself included.

The verb &quot;to temper&quot;, used in the musical sense, means to mistune a pure interval by some amount, usually a fraction of some comma.  Historically, temperaments tended to refer to specific variants of meantone, designated either with a fraction of the syntonic comma, or with some proper name in the case of well-temperaments or other circulating temperaments.  A &quot;circular mapping between groups&quot; does not sound like it is the same thing as a circular temperament.</p><p>There is often much confusion among new-comers about the difference between tunings and temperaments.  Knowing what it means &quot;to temper&quot;, it seems that &quot;a temperament&quot; should be a specific tuning arrived at by mistuning some Just scale by a particular amount.  The conception of temperaments as these abstract mappings of rationals to irrationals, which can be instantiated as a boundless variety of tunings represents an advancement that occurred in our group and hasn&apos;t yet reached widespread use.

And why does it matter whether it is?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the Baroque era tempered scales were described by<br/>&gt; fractions of the Pythagorean comma.  In the previous era,<br/>&gt; bearing plans had to do with eliminating the syntonic comma.<br/>&gt; Authors of both eras sometimes confused the two, as they<br/>&gt; are near in size.</p><p>Well, in your FAQ you say:</p><p>&quot;In traditional Western keyboard practice, a &quot;temperament&quot; is usually what defines how the keys are tuned,&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;m talking about.  You are already aware that the use of the term &quot;temperament&quot; in microtonal theory is a deviation from (or an advancement of) the traditional Western usage of the term, which specifically eliminates any reference to actually tuning anything in a specific way.  In other words, a &quot;temperament&quot; in microtonal theory is definitvely *not* &quot;how the keys are tuned&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is often much confusion among new-comers about the<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between tunings and temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the situation will be improved by conflating them?</p><p>They&apos;re already conflated in the mind of the newcomer, because of the reasons given above.  We use &quot;temperament&quot; to refer to something abstract and not related to specific tunings; most non-microtonalists who are familiar with the term &quot;temperament&quot; are familiar with it as designating specific tunings.  Or at the very least are familiar with it designating (12-tone) equal temperament.</p><p>A temperament, in our sense, is at least another level of abstraction above the traditional sense.  What we&apos;d call a tuning, a new-comer might call a temperament.  What we&apos;d call a temperament is something most new-comers don&apos;t even have a word for.  And what they&apos;d call a tuning, we might even call a scale--from your FAQ, a scale is &quot;An ordered list of intervals, which may be applied to a given concert pitch to generate an ordered list of pitches that can be used to tune an instrument&quot;--it sounds like the open strings of a guitar could fit this definition of &quot;scale&quot;, so what people call different &quot;tunings&quot; of the open strings of a guitar are different &quot;scales&quot; in our lingo.</p><p>I am *not* suggesting that we change anything.  I&apos;m simply suggesting that we all remember that we are using words that non-microtonal musicians use, except that we have given them new meanings that need to be explained to anyone before they&apos;ll understand.  I vaguely recall that I had a bunch of heated discussions with Paul in the early days that only occurred because he was using terms like &quot;tuning&quot;, &quot;temperament&quot;, and &quot;scale&quot; in a way I wasn&apos;t familiar with, without me realizing that he was doing so.  Had I known from the get-go what meanings he was operating with, I would have understood him better and not thought he was talking nonsense at times.  It took me a long time to get that temperaments have literally *nothing* to do with tunings and only vaguely anything to do with scales, and it was a major epiphany when I finally got it.  It should have been &quot;lesson 1&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How does the mapping define JI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It means there will be no comma pumps, for one.  Other<br/>&gt; definitions (such as saying that anything you play in a &quot;just&quot;<br/>&gt; scale will be JI) do not mean this, and in fact JI purists<br/>&gt; unknowingly play comma pumps in JI scales all the time.<br/>&gt; In one apocryphal story (by way of Daniel Wolf), Erv Wilson<br/>&gt; pointed out to Partch that he was trying to transpose the<br/>&gt; tonality diamond, and just using the nearest available<br/>&gt; chromelodeon pitches as proxies.  In another, I found myself<br/>&gt; playing marvel-tempered 7th chords on my piano, and when I<br/>&gt; realized it I became enlightened and forever gave up the<br/>&gt; strict JI dogma I had (to some extent) previously espoused.</p><p>These stories are interesting but don&apos;t answer my question.  In what way does the mapping define JI?</p><p>&gt; On the other side of the coin, doodling in a rank-2 MOS is<br/>&gt; not any more likely to generate good music than doodling at<br/>&gt; a piano without knowing any scales or chords.  In fact it&apos;s<br/>&gt; less likely if the MOS in question has fewer consonances per<br/>&gt; note than 12.</p><p>Why do you mention this?  What does this have to do with anything?</p><p>&gt; In both cases, you have to use the mapping.

Error relative to what, and why should<br/>we care? Without surveying the relevant literature (which is far from<br/>conclusive anyway) I hope we can agree on<br/>the following qualitative properties.</p><p>1. Simple ratios have a desirable affect.<br/>2. The closer to a ratio the stronger the affect.<br/>3. Moderate errors stand out more than small ones.<br/>4. Large errors are irrelevant.&quot;</p><p>Those are the only things you need to assume for every single part of<br/>regular mapping theory to work. That&apos;s it. Graham notes that the<br/>literature is far from conclusive, so instead comes up with a basic,<br/>bare minimum set of assumptions which almost everyone would have to<br/>agree on in some fashion, and then goes on to show how we can even use<br/>those simple ideas to create enormously useful models and do cool<br/>stuff. That is the right way to handle this situation.</p><p>Sometimes, when you ask these questions to Carl or to the group, it<br/>seems like what you want is a tightening of the bounds made by the<br/>above assumptions. When does &quot;simple&quot; stop being simple? How &quot;close&quot;<br/>do you have to be to a ratio for the affect to be noticeable? How<br/>large does an error have to be before it&apos;s &quot;irrelevant?&quot; etc. What,<br/>specifically is the most important &quot;affect&quot; in this set of<br/>assumptions?</p><p>And, as Graham said, many of these tough questions don&apos;t have<br/>conclusive existing answers. That&apos;s my conclusion from debating with<br/>Carl about this for years, talking to Paul about it for years,<br/>watching Carl and Paul sometimes disagree, watching Gene sometimes<br/>disagree with both, reading Parncutt, Cariani, Terhardt, Huron,<br/>Krumhansl, now Benade, Jordan, Shepard, Trehub, Oxenham, and a million<br/>papers from the psychoacoustics literature from people whose names I<br/>forget, etc. I don&apos;t see any clear answer to these questions at all,<br/>nor any consensus on anything, nor any big secret &quot;scientific&quot; answer<br/>that I&apos;m aware of which is custom-tailored to the specific needs of<br/>our community. If what you want is some tuning &quot;authority&quot; to<br/>reiterate this, go read the conversation I just had on XA with Paul,<br/>where it&apos;s not a big secret that he doesn&apos;t claim to have all the<br/>answers either, but that he thinks our model is still a step in the<br/>right direction anyway.</p><p>So when you ask the above questions, you&apos;re basically asking us the<br/>list to speculate. The resulting situation reminds me of a windup toy<br/>running continuously into a wall, schizophrenically saying robotic<br/>phrases like &quot;it&apos;s most scientific to assume that really dark gray is<br/>black&quot; and then &quot;no, it&apos;s most scientific to assume that really dark<br/>gray is dark gray&quot; and and so on.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to say that I don&apos;t like discussing music cognition, or<br/>that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worthwhile to ask the questions you&apos;re asking.<br/>I mean that to ask them under the moniker that there&apos;s some existing<br/>well-known answer which is &quot;more scientific&quot; than the rest of the<br/>half-assed guesses is Bad.

So, I have no problem with it, because it doesn&apos;t assert<br/>&gt; to a claim about how music cognition works or whatever, but reflects<br/>&gt; his high-level compositional paradigm about how to use the<br/>&gt; mathematical objects we have. (I still maintain that the augmented<br/>&gt; Looney Tunes example is &quot;valid&quot; as augmented under his definition<br/>&gt; though, because they deliberately go down three 5/4&apos;s to get back to<br/>&gt; 1/1, which meets his criteria.)</p><p>So, because Keenan&apos;s notion is outside the realm of falsification, you find it unobjectionable, but because I tried to describe the exact same thing in terms that are subject to experimental falsification, you find it unacceptable?

I also agree that if you take 5-limit JI, and wantonly play wolf<br/>&gt; fifths to treat the whole thing like it&apos;s a 12-EDO well temperament or<br/>&gt; something, that that&apos;s a stupid way to use JI. What about someone who<br/>&gt; has a scale where 5/4 and 81/64 share an interval class, and the<br/>&gt; composer just plays major triads indiscriminately and doesn&apos;t play the<br/>&gt; pure ones more? It always goes back to semantics. Shall we say that<br/>&gt; this &quot;is not JI?&quot; Do we want to say that it it&apos;s just &quot;a stupid way to<br/>&gt; use JI?&quot; I dunno, let&apos;s argue over it for a while.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to argue about it, but I would like to stop feeling like we don&apos;t actually know what we mean when we talk about things like JI and temperament.

There are a number of meanings which all<br/>seem &quot;sensible,&quot; and which are mutually contradictory, and we have<br/>almost no evidence at all right now to conclusively pick the &quot;right&quot;<br/>one.</p><p>Even if we did, wtf would it mean? Even if we knew everything, there&apos;d<br/>still be more than one way to use this model to model stuff. It<br/>associates things in Q with things in Z^n, and we know that things in<br/>Q have more than one effect. What if we get real creative one day and<br/>decide that we really care about periodicity buzz, which is more<br/>fragile than virtual pitch integration, and also tends to work for<br/>higher-limit isoharmonic chords? Then we might be working with a<br/>different set of parameters. In fact, I&apos;d like to actually do that<br/>sometime.</p><p>But even besides this, we don&apos;t need to know everything in order to do<br/>build a nice theory around what we do know. There are a few things<br/>most of us agree on, all centered around the idea that simple ratios<br/>can create all of these aural effects which a lot of people think<br/>sound really cool. So, Gene and Paul and Graham and others came up<br/>with a simple model to associate elements in Q with elements in Z^n.<br/>This lets us find all the tunings which have as many simple ratios<br/>tuned as accurately as possible. Now we have a ton of new material<br/>with which to make musical compositions that can exploit these<br/>effects. Woo hoo!</p><p>So I disagree we&apos;re &quot;putting anyone on&quot; with the theory. It&apos;s a good<br/>framework to figure out some awesome sounds that you can use to write<br/>music and base compositions on, and it&apos;s based on some very very<br/>simple assumptions. There&apos;s nothing false about that, nothing that<br/>puts anyone on. If someone says &quot;11-EDO is dissonant and atonal blah<br/>blah blah,&quot; anyone can link to something like this</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhPjsCoMy-Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhPjsCoMy-Q</a></p><p>or write a little throwaway demo that starts off first with it<br/>sounding stupid, and then demonstrates how to make it sound less<br/>atonal afterward</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/tonality-patterns-in-11-edo">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/tonality-patterns-in-11-edo</a></p><p>and say that these sounds come from playing 4:7:9:11 in 11-EDO, which<br/>it supports with abc cents of error. Then, if they&apos;re like oh hey,<br/>looks like 11-EDO isn&apos;t dissonant after all, you gave them something<br/>musically useful. How is that putting anyone on?</p><p>However, it DOES get into the realm of &quot;putting people on&quot; if you try<br/>to bullshit some additional, fully formed scientific conjecture that<br/>explains all of the unknown things that we don&apos;t know, and then assert<br/>that this is how all the hip cool science kids like to guess at what<br/>they don&apos;t know. Then it gets into the realm of putting people on.<br/>Figuring out the &quot;full extent of how the mathematical operations<br/>reflect musical reality&quot; is for composers to figure out, with maybe<br/>some clues from a well-designed experiment or two.</p><p>&gt; Why is it a better solution, in your eyes, to assert the existence of some vague &quot;desirable affect&quot; of simple ratios than to try to formally describe what those desirable properties are?

It can&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Keenan&apos;s point, as I understood it, was that if you play in something<br/>&gt; like porcupine, but you don&apos;t assume there&apos;s any new patterns or<br/>&gt; structure to learn and just use the same mental approach that you do<br/>&gt; when you play 12, then you&apos;re not unlocking the full musical potential<br/>&gt; of the tuning. I have no problem with that because this is his<br/>&gt; opinion. It&apos;s also an opinion I happen to agree with. The statement<br/>&gt; &quot;if you do the same thing you always do in a new environment then you<br/>&gt; miss the new things you can do in the new environment&quot; is A-OK with<br/>&gt; me.</p><p>Why is it stupid to not unlock the full musical potential of the tuning?</p><p>&gt; In contrast, during our conversation, you seemed to make some concrete<br/>&gt; assertions about music and the brain and how it works.</p><p>If I did, then they&apos;re assertions I took directly from the explanations of various psychoacoustic principles given to me by you, Paul, and Carl.</p><p>&gt; The conclusion<br/>&gt; that you ultimately arrived at was that dicot temperament doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; truly exist in a musically relevant sense.</p><p>Well, here we go again.</p><p>There were multiple points I was attempting to make.  Point 1: let&apos;s say I play you a piece of music composed of a bunch of neutral triads, and I ask you whether this music is demonstrating dicot temperament, 2.3.11 243/242 temperament, 2.3.13 512/507, all of the above, none of the above, or some combination of the above.  Let&apos;s imagine you want to say that it&apos;s not all of the above; then there has to be some way you (or even *someone*) could figure it out, based on the music.  Who cares what that could be, the fact that a distinction is possible is good enough, even if it&apos;s based on some totally random idea of what ratios &quot;sound like&quot;.  The point is, if you can give a definite answer, single out a given temperament mapping as being &quot;the right (or least-wrong) answer&quot; to the question of what temperament the music is in--even if other people would disagree, even if there&apos;s no consensus--then we have learned something about your perception of musical reality, and we can say &quot;given these intervals in this musical context, Mike perceives this temperament&quot;.  And we can now definitively say that whatever temperament you selected is real, to at least you.</p><p>If it *is* all of the above, then we have to conclude that all of these temperaments are actually the same thing, and that tempering 25/24 out of the 5-limit is the *same thing* as tempering 243/242 out of the 2.3.11-limit (etc.), which, y&apos;know, I&apos;m cool with that as well.</p><p>Point 2: the adaptive JI problem.  How the hell can one tune dicot in 5-limit adaptive JI?  It is impossible to determine whether a given dicot triad is a 4:5:6 or a 10:12:15, because every chord is both, but in order for the music to sound like 5-limit JI, every triad has to be one or the other.  The only way to come up with an adaptive JI algorithm for dicot temperament would be to allow randomness to decide a given chord&apos;s tuning.  What this means is that there is effectively no way to &quot;use&quot; the dicot mapping, at least in the sense that I understand how one can &quot;use&quot; a mapping at all.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s not true as a blanket statement that we &quot;don&apos;t know what we<br/>&gt; mean,&quot; in general, when we talk about things like JI and temperament.<br/>&gt; Everyone internally knows what they mean, and our internal meanings<br/>&gt; all differ from one another. There are a number of meanings which all<br/>&gt; seem &quot;sensible,&quot; and which are mutually contradictory, and we have<br/>&gt; almost no evidence at all right now to conclusively pick the &quot;right&quot;<br/>&gt; one.</p><p>Right--&quot;we&quot; as a collective entity, &quot;the group&quot;, do not have agreed-upon definitions for these words.  Nor does there seem to be significant understanding between us about what definitions a given group-member is operating with.</p><p>&gt; Even if we did, wtf would it mean? Even if we knew everything, there&apos;d<br/>&gt; still be more than one way to use this model to model stuff. It<br/>&gt; associates things in Q with things in Z^n, and we know that things in<br/>&gt; Q have more than one effect. What if we get real creative one day and<br/>&gt; decide that we really care about periodicity buzz, which is more<br/>&gt; fragile than virtual pitch integration, and also tends to work for<br/>&gt; higher-limit isoharmonic chords? Then we might be working with a<br/>&gt; different set of parameters. In fact, I&apos;d like to actually do that<br/>&gt; sometime.</p><p>Sure, but we&apos;d also have some understanding about when different uses of these models apply and when they don&apos;t.  That&apos;s a long way off.</p><p>&gt; But even besides this, we don&apos;t need to know everything in order to do<br/>&gt; build a nice theory around what we do know. There are a few things<br/>&gt; most of us agree on, all centered around the idea that simple ratios<br/>&gt; can create all of these aural effects which a lot of people think<br/>&gt; sound really cool. So, Gene and Paul and Graham and others came up<br/>&gt; with a simple model to associate elements in Q with elements in Z^n.<br/>&gt; This lets us find all the tunings which have as many simple ratios<br/>&gt; tuned as accurately as possible. Now we have a ton of new material<br/>&gt; with which to make musical compositions that can exploit these<br/>&gt; effects. Woo hoo!</p><p>RMP is about much more than mapping; it would be utterly useless in helping us find tunings without badness and without the various optimization methods.  But even with these, RMP is only as successful as the person wielding it is knowledgeable.  It has no built-in guarantee that it will lead to tunings that display the aural effects associated with simple ratios, because it&apos;s based on user-supplied targets and user-supplied error thresholds, as well as error-based optimization.  Some effects of simple ratios, like synchronous beating, won&apos;t come out of any of our current optimization methods, because error does not correlate with synchronicity of beat frequencies.  Furthermore, some high-error temperaments succeed in producing the effects of simple ratios just fine, because they&apos;re actually equivalent to low-error temperaments of different target intervals.  It currently takes a sharp eye to recognize the temperaments where this is the case--and is the area of the field where I&apos;ve spent the most time.</p><p>&gt; So I disagree we&apos;re &quot;putting anyone on&quot; with the theory. It&apos;s a good<br/>&gt; framework to figure out some awesome sounds that you can use to write<br/>&gt; music and base compositions on, and it&apos;s based on some very very<br/>&gt; simple assumptions. There&apos;s nothing false about that, nothing that<br/>&gt; puts anyone on.</p><p>I beg to differ.  There are some huge and complex assumptions that go into badness rankings and optimization procedures, and these assumptions are based on incomplete knowledge of music cognition.  It&apos;s possible to get total nonsense out of RMP and we don&apos;t currently have anything but our instincts to let us discern what&apos;s nonsense and what&apos;s not.  And my best efforts to codify some methodology for separating the nonsense from the sense lead to you telling me I&apos;m assuming too much--when all I&apos;m assuming is that in fact some mappings are nonsense.</p><p>&gt; However, it DOES get into the realm of &quot;putting people on&quot; if you try<br/>&gt; to bullshit some additional, fully formed scientific conjecture that<br/>&gt; explains all of the unknown things that we don&apos;t know, and then assert<br/>&gt; that this is how all the hip cool science kids like to guess at what<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t know. Then it gets into the realm of putting people on.</p><p>Who&apos;s doing that??</p><p>&gt; Igs, I&apos;d love to formally describe what those properties are. It&apos;s an<br/>&gt; impediment to doing so if we don&apos;t admit exactly what we don&apos;t know at<br/>&gt; the current point in time.</p><p>It&apos;s also an impediment if we don&apos;t admit what we DO know!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2012 7:16:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Feb 12, 2012 at 7:00 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What did you say that&apos;s subject to experimental falsification?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any statement as regards the impossibility of perceiving a certain temperament in music is easily falsifiable by finding an example where the temperament&apos;s mapping succeeds in describing someone&apos;s perception of music.

This paragraph was a<br/>&gt; perfect no-hitter for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So I disagree we&apos;re &quot;putting anyone on&quot; with the theory. It&apos;s a good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; framework to figure out some awesome sounds that you can use to write<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music and base compositions on, and it&apos;s based on some very very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; simple assumptions. There&apos;s nothing false about that, nothing that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; puts anyone on.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I beg to differ. There are some huge and complex assumptions that go into badness rankings and optimization procedures, and these assumptions are based on incomplete knowledge of music cognition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;re neither huge nor complex. Simple ratios sound a certain way,<br/>&gt; it seems to be fairly universal that people hear this sound, and at<br/>&gt; least some people like that sound. That&apos;s all that you need, you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; need to make any further assumptions about music cognition other than<br/>&gt; that. And if someone out there doesn&apos;t like the sound of simple<br/>&gt; ratios, then they shouldn&apos;t use this theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s possible to get total nonsense out of RMP and we don&apos;t currently have anything but our instincts to let us discern what&apos;s nonsense and what&apos;s not. And my best efforts to codify some methodology for separating the nonsense from the sense lead to you telling me I&apos;m assuming too much--when all I&apos;m assuming is that in fact some mappings are nonsense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct. Mappings are abstract mathematical objects with lots of uses.<br/>&gt; We don&apos;t even know what all of the uses for them are yet. To write one<br/>&gt; off as &quot;being nonsense&quot; is like this crazy nonsensical statement in<br/>&gt; and of itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t imagine why you&apos;re not happy with the phrase &quot;I can&apos;t conceive<br/>&gt; of any possible use for that temperament.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unless, of course, you just informally mean that some mappings are<br/>&gt; nonsense in the sense that Keenan thinks that some temperaments are<br/>&gt; stupid. In which case, I agree, the temperament eliminating 3/2 is<br/>&gt; stupid, meaning I&apos;ll never use it because I can&apos;t conceive of any<br/>&gt; possible use for that temperament, nor any mental benefit conferred to<br/>&gt; my understanding of a tuning system by mapping things that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Igs, I&apos;d love to formally describe what those properties are. It&apos;s an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; impediment to doing so if we don&apos;t admit exactly what we don&apos;t know at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the current point in time.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s also an impediment if we don&apos;t admit what we DO know!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;m pretty clear, internally, on what I do and don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2012 9:42:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, Feb 12, 2012 at 1:57 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... there you go with this &quot;JI&quot; and &quot;RI&quot; stuff!

It&apos;s an informal, compositional-level distinction, but if<br/>&gt; that&apos;s all you were saying, I wouldn&apos;t be pedantic about it, although<br/>&gt; I&apos;d still probably try to use fair-minded terms to convey that<br/>&gt; concept. But that&apos;s not what we end up talking about.

Every temperament has a scalar value representing<br/>&gt; the degree of its &quot;existence,&quot; instead of a quantized binary<br/>&gt; &quot;exists/not exists&quot; value as you suggest. Except instead of<br/>&gt; &quot;existence,&quot; we just call it &quot;error,&quot; or rather the inverse of it. I<br/>&gt; think it&apos;s elegant and the perfect solution to this problem, and I<br/>&gt; wish more people felt the same way. I don&apos;t know why it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; satisfy you.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t satisfy me because it doesn&apos;t model my experience.

Or in other words, we&apos;d perceive an infinity of Q&apos;s in any single Z^n.  That we can&apos;t do this is, to me, sufficient reason to believe some temperaments are unhearable.</p><p>Even Graham claims that large errors are irrelevant: &quot;Finally, I&apos;m simply observing that if a mistuning gets stupidly large, an interval won&apos;t be heard as an approximation of the ratio you&apos;re measuring it relative to. As an extreme example, calling a semitone an approximation to 3:2 is meaningless. Saying that a whole tone has a smaller error as a 3:2 is also meaningless. It&apos;s better to say that neither of them will sound at all like a 3:2.&quot;  Clearly there are some cases that are not gray areas.  I&apos;m okay with there being gray areas, but we ought to have at least some idea of where the gray areas end and begin, and some idea of what it *means* to be in a gray area.</p><p>The point I tried to make a while ago is that regardless of whatever method someone uses to recognize intervals &quot;as&quot; intervals--be it a cultural thing, a training thing, an inborn/physiological thing, a purely psychoacoustic thing--all of our current understanding of music cognition suggests that the threshold of recognizability of an interval has to end somewhere.  Maybe we haven&apos;t proven that it&apos;s impossible to hear a 9/8 as a 3/2, but if it *did* turn out to be possible, it would be inconsistent with everything we currently understand and would necessitate a massive paradigm shift requiring us to abandon everything we currently think we understand.  Until that happens, we have good reason to believe it *won&apos;t* happen--namely, because it&apos;s inconsistent with our current understanding.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t have a problem at all with you trying to work towards that.<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love for us all to work towards that. In the absence of an<br/>&gt; existing, convincing scientific explanation, what I&apos;m not okay with is<br/>&gt; any &quot;scientific&quot; explanation that substitutes your heuristic judgments<br/>&gt; of ontological likelihood for actual scientific knowledge of the<br/>&gt; truth.</p><p>All work has to start somewhere.

Every conversation goes something like<br/>&gt; this: &quot;Let&apos;s say someone hears 3L4s and says it sounds like 4:5:6.<br/>&gt; Thus, we can say that this person is perceiving dicot.

Maybe we haven&apos;t proven that it&apos;s impossible to hear a 9/8 as a 3/2, but if it *did* turn out to be possible, it would be inconsistent with everything we currently understand and would necessitate a massive paradigm shift requiring us to abandon everything we currently think we understand. Until that happens, we have good reason to believe it *won&apos;t* happen--namely, because it&apos;s inconsistent with our current understanding.</p><p>Igs, if all you were saying is that calling 100 cents a 3/2 is silly,<br/>I wouldn&apos;t even argue it at this point. I still think that your choice<br/>of language and overall paradigm about treating the &quot;recognizability&quot;<br/>of a stimulus as an &quot;objective&quot; is crude and coarse, but I&apos;d have long<br/>given up on the pedantry by now. Also, no part of my paradigm involves<br/>or requires making any hard and fast assumptions at all about when 3/2<br/>stops being &quot;heard as a 3/2,&quot; because it treats almost every notion of<br/>&quot;heard as&quot; that I can think of as a scalar value and not a boolean,<br/>which is also what HE says if you&apos;d like to cite that. And, I think<br/>that the fact that leaving it open is something that would require you<br/>to experience a massive paradigm shift would seem to indicate that<br/>your paradigm isn&apos;t as solid as mine, because it&apos;s built on<br/>unnecessary assumptions. But, if the crux of this argument was, it&apos;s<br/>stupid to say that 204 cents is 3/2, I&apos;d have long given up on any<br/>pedantry over this point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t have a problem at all with you trying to work towards that.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d love for us all to work towards that. In the absence of an<br/>&gt; &gt; existing, convincing scientific explanation, what I&apos;m not okay with is<br/>&gt; &gt; any &quot;scientific&quot; explanation that substitutes your heuristic judgments<br/>&gt; &gt; of ontological likelihood for actual scientific knowledge of the<br/>&gt; &gt; truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All work has to start somewhere. What, in your estimation, would constitute &quot;actual scientific knowledge of the truth&quot; in this matter?</p><p>What&apos;s the specific claim that we&apos;re testing?</p><p>&gt; What would it take to prove that a given temperament is objectively absurd on a musical level? Is our current understanding of musical cognition really so deficient that we can&apos;t ascertain whether Father temperament is objectively absurd on a musical level or not?</p><p>What does &quot;objectively absurd&quot; mean? You keep DEFINING these words as<br/>the outcomes of certain experiments. If Alice thinks this sounds more<br/>like stimulus a then b, &quot;then we can say that for her, mapping b is<br/>absurd.&quot; What scientific evidence do you need to define that term?</p><p>&gt; &gt; This is a purely semantic discussion and it makes no sense to me why<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;d want to define that term that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Define which term? Existence?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, please explain how if three temperaments can sound the same, that they can be &gt; &gt; musically different.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Find ways to make them not sound the same.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay. What if there are no ways to make them not sound the same?</p><p>I can think of several trivial ways to make dicot and mohajira sound<br/>the same. Tune dicot to 13-EDO, where the 5/4&apos;s are 369 cents, and the<br/>3/2&apos;s are 738 cents. I &quot;perceive a resemblance&quot; between 369 cents and<br/>a JI 5/4, and I also &quot;perceive a resemblance&quot; between 738 cents and a<br/>JI 3/2, which meets your criteria for &quot;hearing a temperament.&quot; I can<br/>tell that two of the things that I perceive as resembling 5/4 make up<br/>one of the things that I perceive as resembling 3/2. Now what?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Sure. Here&apos;s a musical composition in adaptive dicot temperament:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/the-adaptive-ji-song">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/the-adaptive-ji-song</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is also in adaptive meantone, adaptive schismatic, adaptive<br/>&gt; &gt; mavila, adaptive porcupine, adaptive blackwood, adaptive father,<br/>&gt; &gt; adaptive bug, the adaptive tuning of the temperament where 9/8<br/>&gt; &gt; vanishes, and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Funny, but also wrong. It&apos;s not an adaptive tuning of any temperament.</p><p>Goalposts moved! What about this composition? Just the main theme.

But we&apos;re going to use the word &quot;existence&quot; to<br/>describe an abstract regular temperament which doesn&apos;t seem musically<br/>useful under all of the circumstances that we&apos;ve thought of so far?<br/>That seems like this crazy statement to make.</p><p>If you want to make a statement about a specific TUNING, and<br/>&quot;perceiving&quot; some ratio within the tuning, just make that statement.<br/>Temperaments are DEFINED as existing iff they&apos;re homomorphisms from<br/>the rationals to Z^n, so it just doesn&apos;t make sense to me to use that<br/>term; it&apos;s about as confusing as you could possibly get. If you want<br/>to talk about perception I don&apos;t see why you don&apos;t just talk about<br/>that directly.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I can think of several trivial ways to make dicot and mohajira sound<br/>&gt; &gt; the same. Tune dicot to 13-EDO, where the 5/4&apos;s are 369 cents, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; 3/2&apos;s are 738 cents. I &quot;perceive a resemblance&quot; between 369 cents and<br/>&gt; &gt; a JI 5/4, and I also &quot;perceive a resemblance&quot; between 738 cents and a<br/>&gt; &gt; JI 3/2, which meets your criteria for &quot;hearing a temperament.&quot; I can<br/>&gt; &gt; tell that two of the things that I perceive as resembling 5/4 make up<br/>&gt; &gt; one of the things that I perceive as resembling 3/2. Now what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, now you&apos;ve proven that dicot was a bad example on my part. Congratulations!</p><p>OK, but the salient point here is that you were about to write off the<br/>entire &quot;existence&quot; of a temperament, and all it took was for me to<br/>write a paragraph telling you to tune it differently to completely<br/>change your mind about it. Same with the &quot;absurdly complex&quot;<br/>temperament Keenan just came up with which is associated with a unique<br/>~4 or 5 bar chord progression that only it can do.</p><p>You keep talking about how you don&apos;t want to assume that these crazy<br/>novel musical circumstances could exist unless you have evidence for<br/>them. Well, is the above example not sufficient evidence for the<br/>existence of musical circumstances that you of I or nobody is<br/>currently thinking of? I&apos;m sure if I&apos;m clever enough I could even<br/>figure out a way to make the temperament eliminating 9/8 work. Would<br/>that convince you that it&apos;s bad to write things off at this point in<br/>time?</p><p>Why is it not better to admit that we haven&apos;t thought of all the<br/>clever and offbeat ways we could use these temperaments, rather than<br/>assuming we currently have the capability to declare various<br/>mathematical objects as being musically useless?</p><p>&gt; But hey, what if we force you to use optimal dicot? How easy is it now?</p><p>It&apos;s still easy. If in dicot I play a bunch of 2:3:4:6:8:9:10:12<br/>chords, I can easily hear &quot;a resemblance&quot; between the dicot-tempered<br/>version and the JI version of that chord. It basically sounds to me<br/>like exactly what dicot says it sounds like, which is a really high<br/>error version of that chord. This is, of course, me turning all of my<br/>knowledge of categories vs psychoacoustics and all that off, and just<br/>telling you on an intuitive level exactly what it sounds like. In<br/>contrast, if you&apos;re using mohajira, just play lots of 11-limit harmony<br/>everywhere, I dunno.</p><p>I mean, I hear a resemblance to 5-limit harmony all over this album -<br/><a href="http://split-notes.com/004/">http://split-notes.com/004/</a></p><p>This could be me hearing 12-based categories, right? But of course, we<br/>don&apos;t really know the full story there, and you just mentioned to<br/>&quot;hear a resemblance&quot; and so on.</p><p>&gt; This ties back into what I was saying about the assumptions behind optimization and badness. I think exotemperaments like bug, father, and dicot, are great examples where the lowest-error tuning is not the one that best preserves the &quot;recognizability&quot; of the mapping.</p><p>Or don&apos;t use a fixed pitch tuning at all. The whole point of a<br/>&quot;mapping,&quot; which is also called an &quot;abstract regular temperament,&quot; is<br/>that it&apos;s larger than any single tuning.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2012 6:37:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/13/2012 6:13 PM, cityoftheasleep wrote:</p><p>&gt; Specifically, though, I&apos;m trying to explore into some of the gray<br/>&gt; areas and see if they actually are gray, and why.

As an aside, you&apos;re not correct that the hedgehog[8] example demonstrates 9/8 vanishing.  We&apos;d have to hear 500 cents as a 3/2 for that.  Hearing 600 cents as a 3/2 might be 15/14 vanishing or something, depending on what you want to say 600 cents is.</p><p>&gt; OK. Well, good! I disagree with the speculative assessments I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; so far, but as long as we&apos;re all happy to admit they&apos;re just<br/>&gt; speculative and not pretending they&apos;re scientific because of things<br/>&gt; like Russell&apos;s teapot, I&apos;m happy.</p><p>WHY did it take so long for you to realize that I&apos;m just speculating and trying to work things out logically, rather than asserting that I&apos;ve got it all figured out and here&apos;s the truth?  Well anyway, I&apos;m glad we&apos;ve finally got there.</p><p>&gt; Except my speculative answer to this<br/>&gt; conundrum is that the best model for this behavior is to say exactly<br/>&gt; what it is, which is that as an interval is detuned the probability of<br/>&gt; &quot;hearing it as&quot; itself decreases, for almost any definition of<br/>&gt; &quot;hearing it as&quot; that I can think of, never quite hitting zero but<br/>&gt; getting arbitrarily close to the point where the likelihood of<br/>&gt; &quot;hearing it as&quot; the original becomes so small as to be practically<br/>&gt; absurd. That&apos;s fine with me, speculatively speaking, although I&apos;m<br/>&gt; perfectly OK with new information changing that picture.</p><p>As am I!  Just because I don&apos;t believe something exists now, doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m going to maintain that belief dogmatically when I suddenly find myself staring it in the face.</p><p>&gt; We&apos;re talking about probabilities. If something has an improbable<br/>&gt; chance of happening, then it has a chance of happening.</p><p>Sure, anything&apos;s possible!  There&apos;s a non-zero probability that I&apos;ll turn into a bowl of petunias in 30 seconds, or that I&apos;ll suddenly gain the ability to fly, or that the TARDIS will materialize in my bedroom.</p><p>&gt; They&apos;re just ideals you want to work towards. The TE tunings for each<br/>&gt; will be different.</p><p>How&apos;s that relevant?  Temperaments aren&apos;t tied to specific tunings, remember?</p><p>&gt; Adaptive tunings for each would be different.</p><p>What about non-adaptive tunings?</p><p>&gt; They&apos;re different things you can do with each scale.</p><p>Say you&apos;re in 8-ED2.  How are they different things you can do with 8-ED2?</p><p>&gt; Well, 750 cents &quot;sounds kinda like 3/2&quot; to me, and 450 cents &quot;sounds<br/>&gt; kinda like 5/4,&quot; so I&apos;m happy.</p><p>That&apos;s not father temperament.  750 cents has to sound kinda like 3/2 and kinda like 8/5.  I don&apos;t think it sounds like either, I think it sounds like a flat 11/7.  450 cents has to sound like 5/4 and 4/3, but I don&apos;t think it sounds like either, I think it sounds like a sharp 9/7.  More importantly, 0-450-750 has to sound like a 4:5:6 and a 15:20:24 and a 9:12:16 and a 16:20:25.  I don&apos;t think it sounds like any of those, I think it sounds like an out-of-tune 7:9:11.  It&apos;s possible that you could fool me into thinking those intervals sound like out-of-tune 5-limit intervals, and if you could, I&apos;d say &quot;great job, you&apos;ve shown me how to &apos;activate&apos; my father temperament perception.  Okay, how did you do it?  Great, now we&apos;ve learned something!  Now let&apos;s apply this new knowledge and beef up our theories about music cognition.&quot;</p><p>&gt; You are a special case of human being. Everyone alive is unique in<br/>&gt; their own special way. We all have our own unique fingerprints, DNA,<br/>&gt; and way of using temperament mappings. What&apos;s sensible for you might<br/>&gt; not be sensible for someone who&apos;s using it all differently.</p><p>And yet, we are all enough alike that the field of biology is possible, that the field of medicine is possible, that the field of psychology is possible, that the field of psychoacoustics is possible...my individual idiosyncrasies are not so great that I can&apos;t make any generalizations from my experience to the experience of others.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m saying that that notion, by itself, isn&apos;t something I&apos;d be arguing<br/>&gt; with. I do think that the whole &quot;x is heard as y&quot; paradigm itself,<br/>&gt; where we pretend subjective things are objective, is totally crude and<br/>&gt; coarse and a loaded way of putting it, but if that&apos;s all you were<br/>&gt; saying, I wouldn&apos;t be pedantic about it. But, we&apos;re talking about<br/>&gt; dicot.</p><p>Then stop being pedantic about it!</p><p>&gt; Musically evoked means what, someone hears it and says &quot;that sounds<br/>&gt; like 5/4?&quot; I&apos;m pretty sure I could play some stuff in 12-EDO that<br/>&gt; would leave most people unable to tell me the chord quality of some<br/>&gt; arbitrary chord in a trippy sequence of chords, so that most<br/>&gt; effectively wouldn&apos;t be able to tell me if a chord was major or minor<br/>&gt; or &quot;sounds like 4:5:6&quot; or &quot;sounds like 10:12:15&quot; or whatever. Then<br/>&gt; they won&apos;t be able to actively able to compare with some prior,<br/>&gt; remembered stimulus, thus failing by this definition.</p><p>Right.  And in doing so, you would have &quot;broken&quot; their sense of temperament, they wouldn&apos;t be perceiving any image of Q in Z^n, so the mapping would break and the temperament would cease to exist in that moment.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; What does &quot;objectively absurd&quot; mean?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s say &quot;incompatible with known mechanisms of human music cognition.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you give an example of such a mechanism and a limitation it would provide?</p><p>You know more about the mechanisms of human music cognition than I do...why don&apos;t you tell me?  Maybe I have a totally warped view of how music cognition works, I never studied this stuff, everything I know I got from you, Paul, and Carl!</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s ridiculous! First off, again, temperaments imply NO TUNING AT<br/>&gt; ALL. You can tune them however. You don&apos;t even need to use fixed pitch<br/>&gt; instruments.

Does a picture exist before it&apos;s painted?</p><p>&gt; If you want to make a statement about a specific TUNING, and<br/>&gt; &quot;perceiving&quot; some ratio within the tuning, just make that statement.<br/>&gt; Temperaments are DEFINED as existing iff they&apos;re homomorphisms from<br/>&gt; the rationals to Z^n, so it just doesn&apos;t make sense to me to use that<br/>&gt; term; it&apos;s about as confusing as you could possibly get. If you want<br/>&gt; to talk about perception I don&apos;t see why you don&apos;t just talk about<br/>&gt; that directly.</p><p>Again, I think that&apos;s a short-sighted and misleading definition of temperaments.  The mathematical objects can be defined without any identification with musical intervals, and I would argue that they are only temperaments if they can be identified with musical intervals.  That means that you need to be able to do more than mathematically define a temperament to assert its reality--you have to be able to connect it to music in some meaningful way.</p><p>&gt; OK, but the salient point here is that you were about to write off the<br/>&gt; entire &quot;existence&quot; of a temperament, and all it took was for me to<br/>&gt; write a paragraph telling you to tune it differently to completely<br/>&gt; change your mind about it.

Hypothesize, test, conclude, modify.  You just saw it happen.  I posited that dicot temperament doesn&apos;t exist, you showed me a case where it does, thereby falsifying my hypothesis, and my hypothesis was rejected.</p><p>&gt; You keep talking about how you don&apos;t want to assume that these crazy<br/>&gt; novel musical circumstances could exist unless you have evidence for<br/>&gt; them.

How easy is it now?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s still easy. If in dicot I play a bunch of 2:3:4:6:8:9:10:12<br/>&gt; chords, I can easily hear &quot;a resemblance&quot; between the dicot-tempered<br/>&gt; version and the JI version of that chord. It basically sounds to me<br/>&gt; like exactly what dicot says it sounds like, which is a really high<br/>&gt; error version of that chord. This is, of course, me turning all of my<br/>&gt; knowledge of categories vs psychoacoustics and all that off, and just<br/>&gt; telling you on an intuitive level exactly what it sounds like.

You determine whether it&apos;s dicot vs. mohajira according to the nearest JI chord that a given tempered chord sounds like.  So if I&apos;m playing around in 24-ED2, playing a bunch of 0-700-1200-1900-2400-2600-2750-3100 chords, you&apos;re going to go &quot;oh, dicot, totally&quot;; but if I should happen to drop in a 0-700-1200-1400-1750 chord, you&apos;ll go &quot;oh, that&apos;s a 4:6:8:9:11 chord, this is mohajira&quot;.  It&apos;s only dicot so long as the chords are sounding to you like what the mapping says.  As soon as you hear a chord that doesn&apos;t fit the mapping, your perception switches over to a mapping that fits the chord.</p><p>So if I were to load up a .scl file of POTE dicot[7]...</p><p>! regular.scl<br/>!<br/>7 note scale from some Dicot temperament.<br/>! 7 &amp; 3 Fokker block.<br/>!

Woo<br/>hoo. So I&apos;ll move on from this and get into that, because this is<br/>like, new research on the list, for once.</p><p>What I suggest is to think hard about how to handle the phrase<br/>&quot;[perceptual] things either exist or they don&apos;t&quot; in this field. While<br/>this statement is very obviously true, I&apos;ve found that it can be a<br/>very limiting factor in studying this stuff. This is because we&apos;re<br/>dealing with something as tenuous as the perception of a single person<br/>- actually, we&apos;re dealing with the perceptions of large groups of<br/>people. So while it&apos;s obvious that things either exist or they don&apos;t,<br/>it&apos;s very difficult - actually in some cases, I might believe it&apos;s<br/>mathematically impossible, for the same sorts of reasons that Turing&apos;s<br/>famous &quot;halting problem&quot; is impossible - to know when they do or<br/>don&apos;t.</p><p>What I&apos;ve found to be a freeing paradigm is to think instead in terms<br/>of the -probability- that something will exist. We need not talk about<br/>the actual existence of things now, but the likelihood that they<br/>-will- exist when performed. This allows us to completely sidestep all<br/>of the above problems. Furthermore, once you start thinking entirely<br/>in terms of probabilities, you allow yourself to plug into what is<br/>probably the coolest branch of mathematics I know of, and that&apos;s<br/>information theory. In this field, &quot;information&quot; is defined as the<br/>outcome of a random variable. Thinking in these terms allows us to<br/>stop worrying about what&apos;s being transmitted through these discrete<br/>random variables - what the &quot;meaning&quot; of the information is - and<br/>allows us to start thinking about things like how much information, of<br/>whatever &quot;meaning,&quot; is transmitted at all (the Shannon entropy of the<br/>signal), how &quot;clear&quot; the channel is vs how noisy (the mutual<br/>information of the channel), and how clear the channel COULD BE if you<br/>carefully custom-tailor the information you send to avoid &quot;noise&quot; (the<br/>channel capacity), how difficult it is to &quot;guess&quot; at the information<br/>in a noisy channel (the Renyi entropy) and so on.</p><p>The above isn&apos;t even a fraction of the useful concepts floating around<br/>this field, which was initially designed to handle things like<br/>electrical communication channels despite that the engineers working<br/>on this stuff will ever know what information is being transmitted. In<br/>that case, the quantum leap in thought was to not worrying about what<br/>actual information (&quot;meaning&quot;) was being transmitted, but to think<br/>about the overall characteristics of the signal and the channels for<br/>which this meaning is transmitted at all. I think the same leap<br/>applies here, and even though this paradigm isn&apos;t going to give you<br/>the hard and fast answer you may be looking for, it&apos;s powerful enough<br/>to make a lot of good, real progress with minimal assumptions, which<br/>is good. We can model the &quot;clarity&quot; of scales as the mutual<br/>information of an information channel, the &quot;clarity&quot; of a ratio as a<br/>type of Shannon entropy, the &quot;intelligibility&quot; of a category as a type<br/>of min-entropy, and a ton of other stuff.</p><p>I can&apos;t say I understand all of the implications of the above paradigm<br/>- I&apos;m still looking for the single unifying theme that ties it al<br/>together. All I can say is it&apos;s worth not adopting a philosophy that<br/>rules these sorts of ideas out. (Plus, information theory is easier to<br/>learn and more awesome than exterior algebra anyway.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Part of the problem is that you don&apos;t seem to be acknowledging that a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;temperament&quot; doesn&apos;t imply the POTE version or even a fixed-pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; example at all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not true.

Even dumb<br/>things like tempering out 9/8 have some dumb use.</p><p>But since you, below, said you don&apos;t mind including categorical<br/>perception in this - I assure you that it&apos;s almost impossible to find<br/>anything that&apos;s truly impossible to be perceived. Categorical<br/>perception is nuts, especially for someone like me who has AP and has<br/>categorized the pitch spectrum itself. I hear 12-EDO in everything.</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;m fine with that. I&apos;d love to have a more nuanced view of temperament where we allow that it&apos;s not the mathematical structure alone that defines the temperament, but also the effects of musical context on intervallic perception. As an aside, you&apos;re not correct that the hedgehog[8] example demonstrates 9/8 vanishing. We&apos;d have to hear 500 cents as a 3/2 for that. Hearing 600 cents as a 3/2 might be 15/14 vanishing or something, depending on what you want to say 600 cents is.</p><p>If we hear 600 cents as 3/2, then 2*600 is 1200 = 2/1 = 9/4 = 9/8 vanishes.</p><p>&gt; As am I! Just because I don&apos;t believe something exists now, doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m going to maintain that belief dogmatically when I suddenly find myself staring it in the face.</p><p>Ok, but my point is that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good idea to assume that<br/>things don&apos;t exist right now, in 2012.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We&apos;re talking about probabilities. If something has an improbable<br/>&gt; &gt; chance of happening, then it has a chance of happening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, anything&apos;s possible! There&apos;s a non-zero probability that I&apos;ll turn into a bowl of petunias in 30 seconds, or that I&apos;ll suddenly gain the ability to fly, or that the TARDIS will materialize in my bedroom.</p><p>Yeah, that seems right to me. Possible, but not likely.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They&apos;re just ideals you want to work towards. The TE tunings for each<br/>&gt; &gt; will be different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How&apos;s that relevant? Temperaments aren&apos;t tied to specific tunings, remember?</p><p>My point is that different mappings imply different ideals for the<br/>same scale, and this is partly reflected in that they have different<br/>TE tunings.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They&apos;re different things you can do with each scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Say you&apos;re in 8-ED2. How are they different things you can do with 8-ED2?</p><p>Consider 6-EDO in the 2.9 subgroup. Now consider it in the 2.5.7.9.11<br/>subgroup. Tune the latter so that the 11/4 is pure. How are these<br/>different things you can do with 6-EDO?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Well, 750 cents &quot;sounds kinda like 3/2&quot; to me, and 450 cents &quot;sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; kinda like 5/4,&quot; so I&apos;m happy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s not father temperament. 750 cents has to sound kinda like 3/2 and kinda like 8/5. I don&apos;t think it sounds like either, I think it sounds like a flat 11/7.</p><p>To me it sort of sounds like all three of those things, assuming I<br/>ignore everything I&apos;ve learned about music in the past year and<br/>equivocate between ratios and categories.</p><p> 450 cents has to sound like 5/4 and 4/3, but I don&apos;t think it sounds<br/>like either, I think it sounds like a sharp 9/7.</p><p>To me it sort of sounds like all three of those things, assuming I<br/>ignore everything I&apos;ve learned about music in the past year and<br/>equivocate between ratios and categories.</p><p>&gt; More importantly, 0-450-750 has to sound like a 4:5:6 and a 15:20:24 and a 9:12:16 and a 16:20:25. I don&apos;t think it sounds like any of those, I think it sounds like an out-of-tune 7:9:11.</p><p>It&apos;s vaguely recognizable as 4:5:6, I&apos;d say, assuming I ignore<br/>everything I&apos;ve learned about music in the past year and equivocate<br/>between ratios and categories.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s possible that you could fool me into thinking those intervals sound like out-of-tune 5-limit intervals, and if you could, I&apos;d say &quot;great job, you&apos;ve shown me how to &apos;activate&apos; my father temperament perception. Okay, how did you do it? Great, now we&apos;ve learned something! Now let&apos;s apply this new knowledge and beef up our theories about music cognition.&quot;</p><p>You should join XA chat, where we&apos;ve been talking about this stuff for<br/>months now. (I wish we were documenting it). For starters, I&apos;d say:<br/>play slendroid in 16-EDO, 3 3 1 3 3 3. Just play the first 5 notes<br/>over and over. That makes the 450 cents to me sound like a 5/4, except<br/>I&apos;m actually wantonly equivocating it with &quot;major third&quot; here because<br/>of your totally subjective definition and now I need to go take a<br/>shower to cleanse myself.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You are a special case of human being. Everyone alive is unique in<br/>&gt; &gt; their own special way. We all have our own unique fingerprints, DNA,<br/>&gt; &gt; and way of using temperament mappings. What&apos;s sensible for you might<br/>&gt; &gt; not be sensible for someone who&apos;s using it all differently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And yet, we are all enough alike that the field of biology is possible, that the field of medicine is possible, that the field of psychology is possible, that the field of psychoacoustics is possible...my individual idiosyncrasies are not so great that I can&apos;t make any generalizations from my experience to the experience of others.</p><p>OK, but we&apos;re all using temperaments differently and so your<br/>conclusions will only extrapolate to your own personal interpretation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m saying that that notion, by itself, isn&apos;t something I&apos;d be arguing<br/>&gt; &gt; with. I do think that the whole &quot;x is heard as y&quot; paradigm itself,<br/>&gt; &gt; where we pretend subjective things are objective, is totally crude and<br/>&gt; &gt; coarse and a loaded way of putting it, but if that&apos;s all you were<br/>&gt; &gt; saying, I wouldn&apos;t be pedantic about it. But, we&apos;re talking about<br/>&gt; &gt; dicot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then stop being pedantic about it!</p><p>I&apos;m not. We&apos;re talking about dicot.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Musically evoked means what, someone hears it and says &quot;that sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; like 5/4?&quot; I&apos;m pretty sure I could play some stuff in 12-EDO that<br/>&gt; &gt; would leave most people unable to tell me the chord quality of some<br/>&gt; &gt; arbitrary chord in a trippy sequence of chords, so that most<br/>&gt; &gt; effectively wouldn&apos;t be able to tell me if a chord was major or minor<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;sounds like 4:5:6&quot; or &quot;sounds like 10:12:15&quot; or whatever. Then<br/>&gt; &gt; they won&apos;t be able to actively able to compare with some prior,<br/>&gt; &gt; remembered stimulus, thus failing by this definition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right. And in doing so, you would have &quot;broken&quot; their sense of temperament, they wouldn&apos;t be perceiving any image of Q in Z^n, so the mapping would break and the temperament would cease to exist in that moment.</p><p>My mom can&apos;t figure out what the hell&apos;s going on when I play music at<br/>all, but she likes it; this is no different from that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does &quot;objectively absurd&quot; mean?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let&apos;s say &quot;incompatible with known mechanisms of human music cognition.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you give an example of such a mechanism and a limitation it would provide?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You know more about the mechanisms of human music cognition than I do...why don&apos;t you tell me? Maybe I have a totally warped view of how music cognition works, I never studied this stuff, everything I know I got from you, Paul, and Carl!</p><p>What I know is that this whole notion of &quot;perceiving a ratio as<br/>______&quot; is actually not related to psychoacoustics or music cognition<br/>at all, but just normal, regular, boring old cognition. If I&apos;m exposed<br/>to a stimulus long enough, I&apos;ll remember it and be able to gauge how<br/>much other things are the same and different from it. If an interval<br/>has certain defining features which are associated with it being tuned<br/>a certain way, like the usual small-integer ratio features, I&apos;ll tend<br/>to remember those things about it.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem to me like you&apos;re trying to put a cap on the bounds of<br/>music cognition but on -cognition-. You&apos;re now talking about totally<br/>subjective measures of when an interval &quot;resembles&quot; another. In the<br/>sense you&apos;re talking now, I don&apos;t think that these basic entities<br/>which are being resembled have anything to do with small-integer<br/>ratios. And lastly, as far as resemblances are concerned, what I know<br/>is that the mind is a really, really weird place.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s ridiculous! First off, again, temperaments imply NO TUNING AT<br/>&gt; &gt; ALL. You can tune them however. You don&apos;t even need to use fixed pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments. We haven&apos;t even finished inventing all of the clever ways<br/>&gt; &gt; to use mappings. But we&apos;re going to use the word &quot;existence&quot; to<br/>&gt; &gt; describe an abstract regular temperament which doesn&apos;t seem musically<br/>&gt; &gt; useful under all of the circumstances that we&apos;ve thought of so far?<br/>&gt; &gt; That seems like this crazy statement to make.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tell me, Mike...does a song exist before it&apos;s written? Does a picture exist before it&apos;s painted?</p><p>No, but a temperament exists before you write music in it, because<br/>that&apos;s how Gene defined everything, and I happen to like it.</p><p>&gt; Again, I think that&apos;s a short-sighted and misleading definition of temperaments. The mathematical objects can be defined without any identification with musical intervals, and I would argue that they are only temperaments if they can be identified with musical intervals. That means that you need to be able to do more than mathematically define a temperament to assert its reality--you have to be able to connect it to music in some meaningful way.</p><p>The mathematical objects are always defined with respect to musical<br/>intervals; that&apos;s what the Z^n business is all about. Temperaments are<br/>ideals for how to to intone Z^n.</p><p>&gt; Yep. Hypothesize, test, conclude, modify. You just saw it happen. I posited that dicot temperament doesn&apos;t exist, you showed me a case where it does, thereby falsifying my hypothesis, and my hypothesis was rejected.</p><p>I&apos;m not going to be able to falsify all of your hypotheses just<br/>because I&apos;m not infinitely creative. This seems obvious to me and I<br/>don&apos;t see why you or anyone else would pretend that I&apos;m the arbiter of<br/>good or bad temperaments. You should have more of a healthy self-doubt<br/>about writing stuff off.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You keep talking about how you don&apos;t want to assume that these crazy<br/>&gt; &gt; novel musical circumstances could exist unless you have evidence for<br/>&gt; &gt; them. Well, is the above example not sufficient evidence for the<br/>&gt; &gt; existence of musical circumstances that you of I or nobody is<br/>&gt; &gt; currently thinking of? I&apos;m sure if I&apos;m clever enough I could even<br/>&gt; &gt; figure out a way to make the temperament eliminating 9/8 work. Would<br/>&gt; &gt; that convince you that it&apos;s bad to write things off at this point in<br/>&gt; &gt; time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. Why should it?</p><p>Because you missed something once and you might miss something else?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why is it not better to admit that we haven&apos;t thought of all the<br/>&gt; &gt; clever and offbeat ways we could use these temperaments, rather than<br/>&gt; &gt; assuming we currently have the capability to declare various<br/>&gt; &gt; mathematical objects as being musically useless?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because *everything* is useless until a use is found for it!</p><p>I disagree.</p><p>&gt; Well, there we have it--context. You determine whether it&apos;s dicot vs. mohajira according to the nearest JI chord that a given tempered chord sounds like. So if I&apos;m playing around in 24-ED2, playing a bunch of 0-700-1200-1900-2400-2600-2750-3100 chords, you&apos;re going to go &quot;oh, dicot, totally&quot;; but if I should happen to drop in a 0-700-1200-1400-1750 chord, you&apos;ll go &quot;oh, that&apos;s a 4:6:8:9:11 chord, this is mohajira&quot;. It&apos;s only dicot so long as the chords are sounding to you like what the mapping says. As soon as you hear a chord that doesn&apos;t fit the mapping, your perception switches over to a mapping that fits the chord.</p><p>Under your scheme, which I hate. I think that dicot is something more<br/>abstract than any mode of perception and refers to a certain tuning<br/>ideal for a scalar structure.</p><p>&gt; ...and play a bunch of 0-542.971-697.189 triads, you&apos;d have to say &quot;that&apos;s mohajira, not dicot.&quot; Right?</p><p>I&apos;d probably say that just for the sake of communication, sure. Or an<br/>11-limit higher extension of dicot.</p><p>&gt; This is a big problem in our paradigm right now, in that we really haven&apos;t pinned down what it means to &quot;use&quot; a temperament. It&apos;s not enough to just load up the POTE or TOP or TE scala file of some scale derived from the temperament. You have to do specific things with the music to &quot;activate&quot; perception of the mapping--you have to create the image of Q with Z^n--or you&apos;re just using Z^n, no mapping is taking place, and no temperament is being invoked.</p><p>Look, it&apos;s not a big problem for me, because I went through this<br/>little crisis already. Yes, the paradigm is incomplete. Temperaments<br/>aren&apos;t everything they should be. You&apos;re right, we can&apos;t go claim how<br/>great and complete and scientific and perfect and finished the theory<br/>is. But, they&apos;re still useful as conceptual tools, and I&apos;m happy to<br/>know exactly what their limitations are and use the theory anyway.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or don&apos;t use a fixed pitch tuning at all. The whole point of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;mapping,&quot; which is also called an &quot;abstract regular temperament,&quot; is<br/>&gt; &gt; that it&apos;s larger than any single tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And yet, a temperament is only usable in the form of some tuning. Pretending we can leave tuning out of it altogether is a grievous error.</p><p>Then it makes even less sense to invalidate a temperament before it&apos;s<br/>been given a tuning.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2012 9:53:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What I suggest is to think hard about how to handle the phrase<br/>&gt; &quot;[perceptual] things either exist or they don&apos;t&quot; in this field. While<br/>&gt; this statement is very obviously true, I&apos;ve found that it can be a<br/>&gt; very limiting factor in studying this stuff. This is because we&apos;re<br/>&gt; dealing with something as tenuous as the perception of a single person<br/>&gt; - actually, we&apos;re dealing with the perceptions of large groups of<br/>&gt; people. So while it&apos;s obvious that things either exist or they don&apos;t,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s very difficult - actually in some cases, I might believe it&apos;s<br/>&gt; mathematically impossible, for the same sorts of reasons that Turing&apos;s<br/>&gt; famous &quot;halting problem&quot; is impossible - to know when they do or<br/>&gt; don&apos;t.</p><p>You may be right.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t say I understand all of the implications of the above paradigm<br/>&gt; - I&apos;m still looking for the single unifying theme that ties it al<br/>&gt; together. All I can say is it&apos;s worth not adopting a philosophy that<br/>&gt; rules these sorts of ideas out. (Plus, information theory is easier to<br/>&gt; learn and more awesome than exterior algebra anyway.)</p><p>Well, you&apos;re probably on to something here.  So, in these terms, what do you think of a temperament that maps an element of Q to an element of Z^n that has a very low probability of being interpreted as that element of Q?  Or am I still missing the point of the above?</p><p>&gt; The only ones I can think of involve tempering out actual consonances<br/>&gt; in the chord that&apos;s being played. So tempering out 6/5, for instance -<br/>&gt; unless you intone one ratio two ways at the same time. Anything else I<br/>&gt; can think of some dumb adaptive scheme that would trivially satisfy<br/>&gt; that it has some dumb musical use, even though it&apos;s dumb. Even dumb<br/>&gt; things like tempering out 9/8 have some dumb use.</p><p>Fair enough--perhaps I&apos;m going about it all backwards.  It seems like the more restrictions we have to follow, compositionally-speaking, to successfully invoke recognition of a temperament, the less useful that temperament will be.  So we can at least say that a temperament that&apos;s only useful in a very specific circumstance is less useful than one that&apos;s useful in a wider set of circumstances.  But yeah, tempering out consonances (or, say, tempering out any ratio where n*d&lt;70) is probably going to be entirely useless under any normal musical circumstances.</p><p>&gt; But since you, below, said you don&apos;t mind including categorical<br/>&gt; perception in this - I assure you that it&apos;s almost impossible to find<br/>&gt; anything that&apos;s truly impossible to be perceived.

I hear 12-EDO in everything.</p><p>Yeah, as I mentioned over on XA, I wonder if people like you, highly trained in 12-TET, don&apos;t actually hear JI as some kind of tempering of 12-TET.  If you think about it, if we can say 12-TET tempers out 81/80, 64/63, and 128/125, then we can also look at JI as being an inconsistent temperament of 12-TET, where there&apos;s multiple mappings of 400 cents, multiple mappings of 1000 cents, multiple mappings of 200 cents, etc.  By which I mean, 400 cents might be 5/4, 400&apos; cents might be 81/64, 400&apos;&apos; might be 9/7, etc.</p><p>&gt; If we hear 600 cents as 3/2, then 2*600 is 1200 = 2/1 = 9/4 = 9/8 vanishes.</p><p>Herp derp!!

I might suggest that, because JI is only a type of harmony (and not melody), that temperaments also require harmony to be perceived.  What do you think of that?</p><p>&gt; &gt; And yet, we are all enough alike that the field of biology is possible, that the field of<br/>&gt; &gt;medicine is possible, that the field of psychology is possible, that the field of<br/>&gt; &gt;psychoacoustics is possible...my individual idiosyncrasies are not so great that I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; make any generalizations from my experience to the experience of others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, but we&apos;re all using temperaments differently and so your<br/>&gt; conclusions will only extrapolate to your own personal interpretation.</p><p>Are we, though?  I think my experience with other people is more supportive of the conclusion that we&apos;re all mostly using temperaments the same way, at least insofar as we&apos;re all &quot;using&quot; temperaments (which, who knows to what extent we&apos;re all doing that, since we don&apos;t really know what it means to &quot;use&quot; a temperament).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Musically evoked means what, someone hears it and says &quot;that sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like 5/4?&quot; I&apos;m pretty sure I could play some stuff in 12-EDO that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would leave most people unable to tell me the chord quality of some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrary chord in a trippy sequence of chords, so that most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; effectively wouldn&apos;t be able to tell me if a chord was major or minor<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;sounds like 4:5:6&quot; or &quot;sounds like 10:12:15&quot; or whatever.

How is your mom&apos;s enjoyment of music a refutation of my above assertion about &quot;breaking&quot; someone&apos;s sense of temperament by playing a confusing progression?</p><p>&gt; What I know is that this whole notion of &quot;perceiving a ratio as<br/>&gt; ______&quot; is actually not related to psychoacoustics or music cognition<br/>&gt; at all, but just normal, regular, boring old cognition. If I&apos;m exposed<br/>&gt; to a stimulus long enough, I&apos;ll remember it and be able to gauge how<br/>&gt; much other things are the same and different from it. If an interval<br/>&gt; has certain defining features which are associated with it being tuned<br/>&gt; a certain way, like the usual small-integer ratio features, I&apos;ll tend<br/>&gt; to remember those things about it.</p><p>Well, this is reassuring.  I know more about regular cognition than I do about music-specific cognition.</p><p>&gt; It doesn&apos;t seem to me like you&apos;re trying to put a cap on the bounds of<br/>&gt; music cognition but on -cognition-. You&apos;re now talking about totally<br/>&gt; subjective measures of when an interval &quot;resembles&quot; another.

And that you can&apos;t recognize a temperament of some n-limit JI unless you can categorically-perceive n-limit JI?</p><p>&gt; No, but a temperament exists before you write music in it, because<br/>&gt; that&apos;s how Gene defined everything, and I happen to like it.</p><p>I don&apos;t like it at all, I think it&apos;s the root of all misunderstandings and the reason that no one can figure out what it means to &quot;use&quot; a temperament.

Temperaments are<br/>&gt; ideals for how to to intone Z^n.</p><p>How are the mathematical objects define with respect to musical intervals?  What makes a number a musical interval?  Can musical intervals be described soundlessly?  What would 386 cents mean to a deaf person?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not going to be able to falsify all of your hypotheses just<br/>&gt; because I&apos;m not infinitely creative. This seems obvious to me and I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see why you or anyone else would pretend that I&apos;m the arbiter of<br/>&gt; good or bad temperaments. You should have more of a healthy self-doubt<br/>&gt; about writing stuff off.</p><p>Okay, I get it.  When I say something &quot;doesn&apos;t exist&quot; what I mean is that it is outside the sphere of my experience of reality, but this actually describes two classes of things: 1) things that cannot possibly enter my experience, 2) things that can possibly enter my experience, but haven&apos;t yet.  At any given point in time, it is impossible for me to distinguish whether something outside of my experience is in one class or the other, though I can speculate, and also use logic to rule some things out as &quot;logically impossible&quot; (though even that isn&apos;t 100%, because my reasoning isn&apos;t 100% reliable).  Only through experience do I discover what was possible and what wasn&apos;t, and I&apos;ll never discover all of what is possible.  But sometimes I have to make a leap of faith based on my speculation, just as in order to find my way around a room in the dark, I have to occasionally just take a step and hope that I&apos;m not gonna step on a lego or something.</p><p>What I think is that our understanding of what temperaments *are* is being held back by our refusal to rule some things out.  There, I said it.  I think that in order to progress, we need to make some more assumptions, not fewer.  And of course we&apos;ll have to test those assumptions.  But isn&apos;t this normally how a field progresses?  You start with a vague and general model, and then progressively refine it until it makes predictions of greater and greater specificity?  Is that not a direction we should move in?</p><p>&gt; Look, it&apos;s not a big problem for me, because I went through this<br/>&gt; little crisis already. Yes, the paradigm is incomplete. Temperaments<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t everything they should be. You&apos;re right, we can&apos;t go claim how<br/>&gt; great and complete and scientific and perfect and finished the theory<br/>&gt; is. But, they&apos;re still useful as conceptual tools, and I&apos;m happy to<br/>&gt; know exactly what their limitations are and use the theory anyway.</p><p>Since when were you content to rest on your laurels with this stuff?  Just because everyone else (Graham, Carl, Gene, and maybe even Paul) have put in their time, paid their dues, and consider their work on developing the theory pretty much done, does that mean we shouldn&apos;t keep pushing forward, asking tough questions, and trying to refine more?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2012 10:54:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Feb 14, 2012 at 12:53 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can&apos;t say I understand all of the implications of the above paradigm<br/>&gt; &gt; - I&apos;m still looking for the single unifying theme that ties it al<br/>&gt; &gt; together. All I can say is it&apos;s worth not adopting a philosophy that<br/>&gt; &gt; rules these sorts of ideas out. (Plus, information theory is easier to<br/>&gt; &gt; learn and more awesome than exterior algebra anyway.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, you&apos;re probably on to something here. So, in these terms, what do you think of a temperament that maps an element of Q to an element of Z^n that has a very low probability of being interpreted as that element of Q? Or am I still missing the point of the above?</p><p>Right, so first I&apos;d say that again, a &quot;mapping&quot; doesn&apos;t imply any<br/>tuning. If you want to consider these sorts of scenarios you have to<br/>imply a tuning, probably a fixed-pitch one, or else I can think of<br/>arbitrary ways in which low-accuracy temperaments might become useful.<br/>They even already have names:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Very+low+accuracy+temperaments">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Very+low+accuracy+temperaments</a></p><p>So with regards to your question, what do I think of it? I think it<br/>has a low probability of being musically useful. But the math is made<br/>simpler by just assuming that we&apos;re mapping to definite things rather<br/>than indefinite ones, so that&apos;s why we do that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But since you, below, said you don&apos;t mind including categorical<br/>&gt; &gt; perception in this - I assure you that it&apos;s almost impossible to find<br/>&gt; &gt; anything that&apos;s truly impossible to be perceived. Categorical<br/>&gt; &gt; perception is nuts, especially for someone like me who has AP and has<br/>&gt; &gt; categorized the pitch spectrum itself. I hear 12-EDO in everything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, as I mentioned over on XA, I wonder if people like you, highly trained in 12-TET, don&apos;t actually hear JI as some kind of tempering of 12-TET. If you think about it, if we can say 12-TET tempers out 81/80, 64/63, and 128/125, then we can also look at JI as being an inconsistent temperament of 12-TET, where there&apos;s multiple mappings of 400 cents, multiple mappings of 1000 cents, multiple mappings of 200 cents, etc. By which I mean, 400 cents might be 5/4, 400&apos; cents might be 81/64, 400&apos;&apos; might be 9/7, etc.</p><p>Correct. I feel like I posted some huge rant about this concept to the<br/>tuning list before (that someone used to meantone and moving to JI is<br/>like someone used to JI and moving to inconsistent JI), but now I<br/>can&apos;t find it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Ok, but my point is that I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good idea to assume that<br/>&gt; &gt; things don&apos;t exist right now, in 2012.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see how, in your world view, it&apos;d ever be possible to assume that anything doesn&apos;t exist.</p><p>I don&apos;t ever have a burning need to assume things don&apos;t exist. If<br/>something has a really really really low probability of existing, I&apos;m<br/>totally comfortable with that.</p><p>If we&apos;re talking about some sort of model, and it simplifies<br/>everything to assume that as an approximation things underneath a<br/>certain cutoff don&apos;t exist, and that this still gives good results in<br/>the model, I&apos;m also fine with that. Most of my &quot;models&quot; for everyday<br/>life include some assumption that really unlikely things, like pigs<br/>flying in the sky, are so unlikely that I can just treat them as<br/>definite non-possibilities. And in music theory, if I&apos;m computing HE,<br/>I can get a speedup if I leave out target ratios from the calculation<br/>which are below a certain amount of probability, and the curve looks<br/>almost the same.</p><p>If you were trying to model something in this case, and it involved<br/>throwing some small probabilities away, I&apos;d say go for it. HE itself<br/>throws a ton of stuff away and smooths over a lot of pertinent things<br/>for the sake of having something simple that sort of works. But,<br/>mathematics itself is on a higher level than all that; it&apos;s always<br/>clear what&apos;s being modeled, what the behaviors in question are, and<br/>what approximations you&apos;re making. And it seems like you&apos;re trying to<br/>make a mathematical statement.</p><p>&gt; &gt; My point is that different mappings imply different ideals for the<br/>&gt; &gt; same scale, and this is partly reflected in that they have different<br/>&gt; &gt; TE tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But isn&apos;t the implication of different ideals only relevant if we assume that temperaments are going to be tuned as close to the ideals as possible?</p><p>We don&apos;t need to assume that temperaments are going to have any one<br/>tuning. A temperament could be adaptive, or it could change tunings<br/>inside a piece, or someone could choose an irregular circulating<br/>tuning for it. And no, there are plenty of reasons why we wouldn&apos;t<br/>tune a temperament to the TE tuning or what not - like that 12-EDO<br/>supports meantone.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They&apos;re different things you can do with each scale.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Say you&apos;re in 8-ED2. How are they different things you can do with 8-ED2?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Consider 6-EDO in the 2.9 subgroup. Now consider it in the 2.5.7.9.11<br/>&gt; &gt; subgroup. Tune the latter so that the 11/4 is pure. How are these<br/>&gt; &gt; different things you can do with 6-EDO?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m enforcing pure octaves.</p><p>Then you&apos;re placing restrictions on how well I can answer your question.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s not father temperament. 750 cents has to sound kinda like 3/2 and kinda like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 8/5. I don&apos;t think it sounds like either, I think it sounds like a flat 11/7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To me it sort of sounds like all three of those things, assuming I<br/>&gt; &gt; ignore everything I&apos;ve learned about music in the past year and<br/>&gt; &gt; equivocate between ratios and categories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there ever a case where it only sounds like 2 of those things?</p><p>Sure, different contextual factors might even only make it sound like<br/>one of those things, assuming I ignore everything I&apos;ve learned about<br/>music in the past year and equivocate between ratios and categories.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; More importantly, 0-450-750 has to sound like a 4:5:6 and a 15:20:24 and a 9:12:16 &gt; &gt; and a 16:20:25. I don&apos;t think it sounds like any of those, I think it sounds like an out-&gt; &gt; of-tune 7:9:11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s vaguely recognizable as 4:5:6, I&apos;d say, assuming I ignore<br/>&gt; &gt; everything I&apos;ve learned about music in the past year and equivocate<br/>&gt; &gt; between ratios and categories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unless it&apos;s also vaguely recognizable as 9:12:16 and 16:20:25 and 15:20:24, doesn&apos;t that mean the mapping&apos;s not working?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t inherently mean that, because &quot;the mapping&apos;s not working&quot;<br/>is an arbitrary phrase with no meaning that you just threw in there.<br/>If you&apos;d like to define &quot;the mapping&apos;s not working&quot; as the result of<br/>this outcome, then sure. It&apos;s pretty vaguely recognizable as a minor<br/>chord in second inversion too, which is 15:20:24. 9:12:16 and 16:20:25<br/>aren&apos;t right above; that&apos;d be for 0-450-900.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You should join XA chat, where we&apos;ve been talking about this stuff for<br/>&gt; &gt; months now. (I wish we were documenting it). For starters, I&apos;d say:<br/>&gt; &gt; play slendroid in 16-EDO, 3 3 1 3 3 3. Just play the first 5 notes<br/>&gt; &gt; over and over. That makes the 450 cents to me sound like a 5/4, except<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m actually wantonly equivocating it with &quot;major third&quot; here because<br/>&gt; &gt; of your totally subjective definition and now I need to go take a<br/>&gt; &gt; shower to cleanse myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does it work if you play that over a drone? I might suggest that, because JI is only a type of harmony (and not melody), that temperaments also require harmony to be perceived. What do you think of that?</p><p>Yeah, it works if I play it over a drone.</p><p>&gt; &gt; OK, but we&apos;re all using temperaments differently and so your<br/>&gt; &gt; conclusions will only extrapolate to your own personal interpretation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are we, though? I think my experience with other people is more supportive of the conclusion that we&apos;re all mostly using temperaments the same way, at least insofar as we&apos;re all &quot;using&quot; temperaments (which, who knows to what extent we&apos;re all doing that, since we don&apos;t really know what it means to &quot;use&quot; a temperament).</p><p>There are lots of people who probably are just going with subjective<br/>resemblances. But, there are also people like me, who are trying to<br/>separate subjective resemblance from actual &quot;essence of ratio,&quot; and so<br/>I use temperament differently. Sometimes I don&apos;t use temperaments<br/>consistently at all.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t bother me, because I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that &quot;a<br/>temperament&quot; is an imperfect vehicle for describing all my current<br/>understanding of all of the things going into how music, and I&apos;m not<br/>going to try and pigeonhole it into a role I don&apos;t think it&apos;s designed<br/>for. This is why I keep objecting to your current notion of &quot;hearing a<br/>mapping&quot; as anything other than an informality, because it seems like<br/>that you are trying to pigeonhole it into that role.</p><p>However, I do think temperaments get the job done at least in part,<br/>and I think they&apos;re useful conceptual tools for understanding music<br/>anyway. I think the stuff we&apos;re talking about is separate. If a new<br/>mathematical object comes along that seems more useful, I&apos;m all for<br/>using that instead. But so far, despite my personal, current<br/>understanding of what&apos;s going on, the current mathematical objects are<br/>useful enough to have some musical use anyway, despite their<br/>limitations.</p><p>&gt; &gt; My mom can&apos;t figure out what the hell&apos;s going on when I play music at<br/>&gt; &gt; all, but she likes it; this is no different from that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How is it not different? How is your mom&apos;s enjoyment of music a refutation of my above assertion about &quot;breaking&quot; someone&apos;s sense of temperament by playing a confusing progression?</p><p>Because every single piece of music I ever play &quot;breaks&quot; her<br/>non-existent sense of temperament, so for her, nothing is in 12-EDO or<br/>in anything at all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What I know is that this whole notion of &quot;perceiving a ratio as<br/>&gt; &gt; ______&quot; is actually not related to psychoacoustics or music cognition<br/>&gt; &gt; at all, but just normal, regular, boring old cognition. If I&apos;m exposed<br/>&gt; &gt; to a stimulus long enough, I&apos;ll remember it and be able to gauge how<br/>&gt; &gt; much other things are the same and different from it. If an interval<br/>&gt; &gt; has certain defining features which are associated with it being tuned<br/>&gt; &gt; a certain way, like the usual small-integer ratio features, I&apos;ll tend<br/>&gt; &gt; to remember those things about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, this is reassuring. I know more about regular cognition than I do about music-specific cognition.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a lot of groundbreaking research out there on<br/>music-specific cognition at all, to be honest. There are a few good<br/>things, but they&apos;re embryonic. Infants like ratios and also unequal<br/>scales (they prefer orgone[7] to 7-edo apparently), and also there&apos;s<br/>categorical perception for trained musicians etc, but it&apos;s not like<br/>there&apos;s a clear picture of what&apos;s out there, despite that some earlier<br/>researchers (e.g. Parncutt) seem to think they had one.</p><p>&gt; Would you agree with this: it doesn&apos;t make sense to use temperaments unless you have learned to categorically perceive whatever-limit JI that you&apos;re trying to temper? And that you can&apos;t recognize a temperament of some n-limit JI unless you can categorically-perceive n-limit JI?</p><p>This is your definition of temperament, which had to do with<br/>subjective resemblances. So under your definition, then yes,<br/>obviously, in order to perceive a subjective resemblance, you need to<br/>be able to remember something schematically to compare with the<br/>current stimulus. I don&apos;t know about &quot;categorically&quot; perceive, which<br/>implies something like a discontinuous interval spectrum, but that&apos;s<br/>the basic gist of it.</p><p>But that&apos;s not the only way to use temperaments; you could assume that<br/>interval &quot;identities&quot; come from somewhere else, and treat ratios as<br/>ways to intone those things and make these identities nice and crunchy<br/>sounding. This is the &quot;regular temperament as distortion pedal&quot;<br/>paradigm.</p><p>&gt; &gt; No, but a temperament exists before you write music in it, because<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s how Gene defined everything, and I happen to like it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t like it at all, I think it&apos;s the root of all misunderstandings and the reason that no one can figure out what it means to &quot;use&quot; a temperament. The mappings exist, but I think we&apos;d be able to make much more sense of this paradigm if we defined temperaments as not existing meaningfully outside of music.</p><p>But this is how temperaments have always been defined. They&apos;ve always<br/>been mathematical objects independent of any composition. I feel again<br/>like you&apos;re trying to pigeonhole these things into something they&apos;re<br/>not. The concept you&apos;re talking about has to do with music cognition<br/>and not mathematics, and for those of us who have been studying the<br/>mathematics of this subject, it&apos;s very confusing when you say these<br/>kinds of things. So I wish you&apos;d just coin new terms of your own for<br/>the effects you care about.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The mathematical objects are always defined with respect to musical<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals; that&apos;s what the Z^n business is all about. Temperaments are<br/>&gt; &gt; ideals for how to to intone Z^n.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How are the mathematical objects define with respect to musical intervals? What makes a number a musical interval? Can musical intervals be described soundlessly? What would 386 cents mean to a deaf person?</p><p>Z^n is supposed to reflect a point in a lattice, or a linear<br/>combination of some set of n basis generators. We&apos;re taking this<br/>unmapped, &quot;melodic,&quot; &quot;scalar,&quot; maybe &quot;categorical,&quot; etc lattice, and<br/>we&apos;re associating each point with a set of ratios. That&apos;s the basic<br/>quantum leap here. Once we do that, we can treat this association in a<br/>number of useful ways, such as an optimal intonation for the intervals<br/>in this lattice to make everything as beatless and crunchy as<br/>possible.</p><p>&gt; What I think is that our understanding of what temperaments *are* is being held back by our refusal to rule some things out. There, I said it. I think that in order to progress, we need to make some more assumptions, not fewer. And of course we&apos;ll have to test those assumptions. But isn&apos;t this normally how a field progresses? You start with a vague and general model, and then progressively refine it until it makes predictions of greater and greater specificity? Is that not a direction we should move in?</p><p>I agree that we need more assumptions, and that we may also need to<br/>throw some existing assumptions out. But to know what assumptions to<br/>make, you need to be completely open to experiencing new things, which<br/>means in this case being cautious before ever ruling things out.</p><p>But again, for the sake of modeling things, if you come up with a<br/>model that improves on our understanding that requires ruling out<br/>certain some notion of temperaments that are really really bad, I<br/>think it&apos;ll be useful enough for everyone to be happy. That&apos;s kind of<br/>what &quot;limits&quot; are: I really wish everything was mapped into the<br/>infinite limit, because I think a lot of this confusion would go away<br/>and it might be more elegant in modeling perception. But it makes the<br/>math so easy to just assume that primes beyond a certain limit don&apos;t<br/>exist that that&apos;s the approach that&apos;s won out.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t say that infinite limits are bad or pointless; I&apos;d still<br/>like to keep working on them. But it does mean that it&apos;s OK to<br/>deliberately rule things out if you think it&apos;ll be useful and if<br/>you&apos;re clear about what&apos;s being ruled out.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Look, it&apos;s not a big problem for me, because I went through this<br/>&gt; &gt; little crisis already.

The best contender I&apos;ve seen for<br/>these sorts of problems is the Wicki-Hayden layout, which is John<br/>Moriarty&apos;s goto layout for everything.

But after Mike spent the last few months raking me over the coals for making snap judgments, I&apos;m rescinding my use of the words &quot;existence&quot; and &quot;impossible&quot;, and am instead just asking the open-ended question of &quot;under what conditions will I hear a tuning as bug, vs. hearing it as beep, vs. hearing it as semaphore, vs. hearing it as barbados?&quot;  I am *quite* certain that insofar as it is possible for me to hear the difference between these temperaments, it may require more than tuning changes.</p><p>For instance, I&apos;m pretty sure that no matter how you tune these temperaments (as long as the generator is between 266.67 cents and 240 cents), if you use approximate major/minor triads with normal harmonic timbres, I&apos;m always going to hear beep or semaphore, never bug, never barbados.  Well, maybe as you approach 240 cents, I&apos;ll start hearing the triads as 8:9:12 and 12:16:18, i.e. as 3-limit Blackwood.  But maybe using different harmonies beyond those major and minor triads will allow me to hear different identities in different tunings, and maybe using different timbres will allow me to activate my bug hearing.</p><p>Really, what I&apos;m interested in exploring is what it takes to activate the perception of temperaments.

I&apos;m trying to figure out why I have a tendency to want to call these chords 7-limit sonorities, while John wants to call them 5-limit.  Personally, I use &quot;subminor&quot; to mean &quot;septimal minor&quot;, because when I was introduced to those kinds of chords, they were explained to me as being 6:7:9 (or at least, 1/1-7/6-3/2).  So I just equate &quot;subminor&quot; with &quot;some chord similar in tuning to 6:7:9&quot;.  I presume there&apos;s something about the 7th partial, like what Cameron was saying, like I can recognize (with harmonic timbres) that 6:7:9 is the name of a significant sonority with strong periodicity buzz and low sensory dissonance that can be accessed by flattening a minor 3rd a significant amount.  I should whole-heartedly admit that this is categorical perception that I&apos;ve learned--I&apos;ve learned to categorize based on sonorities that display certain acoustic phenomena, into categories that are named after ratios.</p><p>But this begs a wholly different question: what makes a partial &quot;the 7th partial&quot;?  If we use a remapped timbre where the 5th and 6th partials are now where the 6th and 7th partials used to be, John&apos;s experience seems to suggest that that leads to hearing subminor chords as simply &quot;minor&quot;, like he lacks the category of subminor because of his experience with these warped timbres.  If he moves along the generator spectrum of various temperaments, the partials move with him, leading to progressively less-harmonic timbres but never changing the sensory dissonance aspects.  So what would be &quot;subminor&quot; for me is just a &quot;more bell-like minor&quot; for him.  But at the same time, in these remapped timbres, if the overtone structure is stretched so that the 6th partial is where a normal 7th partial would be, why should that sound different?  It&apos;s the same pitch as the old 7th partial, and I doubt the brain is registering the ordinality of the partials.

There are those who propose that perception of tonality in atonality in music can be attributed to the implications of partial coincidence in the whole of the piece seem to be, though. Spectral analysis does indicate that consistent spectral patterns can amass in the course of a piece, this is something you can easily verify yourself.

It also fits into<br/>lots of nice new xenharmonic chords because it&apos;s also 11/6, so you can<br/>probably construct something useful out of this. Most importantly,<br/>14\16 can be any of these things or maybe many of them at the same<br/>time.</p><p>Internalizing harmonic relationships like this, which might be<br/>considered a non-JI obsessed form of Boomsliter and Creel&apos;s &quot;extended<br/>reference,&quot; totally change the perception of intervals for me. An even<br/>more dramatic case for mavila was 5/2, which is both a &quot;major tenth&quot;<br/>in one diatonic sense, and a &quot;minor tenth&quot; in another (IV/IV/IV). If<br/>you can really hear the latter sense it&apos;s crazy, because it&apos;s not just<br/>a really flat major tenth, it&apos;s also a really sharp minor tenth made<br/>up of really sharp fourths.</p><p>Keenan&apos;s described having similar experiences with pelog; he&apos;s stated<br/>that learning that there were &quot;empats&quot; everywhere (3/2&apos;s) changed his<br/>perception of it from C E F^ G Bv C to something a bit more<br/>harmonically connected by 3/2. For instance, C-F^ is supposed to be<br/>4/3, and Bv-E is also supposed to be 4/3.</p><p>This sort of thing has also factored prominently into my perception of<br/>complex dyads like 9/7; once I learned that they sound great as part<br/>of 4:7:9, that colors the perception of 436 itself to be more<br/>&quot;abstract&quot; in an interesting way, as though it&apos;s hinting at something<br/>(or multiple things) rather than just being this sharp nonsense<br/>interval. I always imagine 9/7 in this new way now. This has in turn<br/>affected my perception of things like 245/243-tempered 1/1-9/7-5/3<br/>chords.</p><p>I assume this is the same sort of thing that Cameron was talking about<br/>when he mentioned how 81/64 is two 9/8&apos;s; he&apos;d just learned that<br/>relationship just like someone learns any of the above.</p><p>Sometimes this breaks down though, as just happened with Gene&apos;s<br/>example, where he could hear all of these larger chords being implied<br/>by the triads he was playing but where many of the rest of us just<br/>heard random stuff going on, without the benefit of that mental<br/>backdrop.</p><p>Anyways, seems to me that this effect - &quot;part of the schematic<br/>representation of an interval is its musical context&quot; - is what&apos;s<br/>differing between you and John. You&apos;ve learned this &quot;7-limit&quot; context<br/>for the intervals being played, maybe just the 7/6 or something, and<br/>have some understanding of how they&apos;re these distorted versions of<br/>things used in larger 7-limit chords, and that the chord is itself a<br/>distorted version of some 7-limit chord, and John doesn&apos;t have that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2012 10:37:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Feb 20, 2012 at 11:34 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; The phenomena of JI intervals are in some sense objective, but the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;schemata associated with them are not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, to Mike: if you agree with this, can you now see that it is not<br/>&gt; &quot;semantics&quot; when I insist on Just Intonation being intonation &quot;of&quot;<br/>&gt; something, but a matter of fundamental understanding?
