It seems to me that you will have to curl your third finger to reach the key that is down-left from the major third, or change the fingering in some weird thumb involved shape.<br/>Is this issue real or is it due to my inexperience with these keyboards?</p></div><h3><a id=68968 href="#68968">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2007 12:47:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; In photos of keyboards I have seen on the web, like the Starr Labs<br/>&gt; or Terpstra, a fingering problem concerning chords comes to my<br/>&gt; attention.<br/>&gt; If you play a simple C Major triad in whatever tuning, with a<br/>&gt; simple 1-3-5 fingering, the position of the fingers is natural<br/>&gt; for the hand.<br/>&gt; But what if you want to play a minor triad?
