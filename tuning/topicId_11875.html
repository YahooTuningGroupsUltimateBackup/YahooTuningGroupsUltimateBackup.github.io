Because the<br/>Hurrian tablet (that is supposed to be the world&apos;s oldest notation but which Monz says really<br/>isn&apos;t) was reported to have the same number of syllables as notes in the notation.  That got me<br/>to thinking of the very elaborate symbolism of some of the philosophers regarding their books<br/>(Schopenhauer, Apuleius, Moses, Nietzsche, etc).  Many of them use Pythagorean and number<br/>symbols intentionally related  to musical ideas.  So I said the joke about the universe doing<br/>that, too (which it is).  And so began the numerology chats.  A very good friend of mine can<br/>hear the mystical/celestial music of creation because he is a very good mystic and yoga<br/>master.  I&apos;ve heard that music on several occasions and it sucks for the most part.  I think<br/>that its better if theorists just look at scientific data and try to wrestle the music out THAT<br/>way----as it translates to the human mind and imagination.  What is actually in the<br/>mystic/celestial radiospace isn&apos;t that impressive----the planets and quantum wave atoms don&apos;t<br/>play very well.  I might have not edited out a segment where I say that standard Mozart and<br/>Bach are better at translating this vision of the ordered cosmos or Arvo Part&apos;s &quot;Miserere&quot;.  I<br/>think that Monz is going to try to do another one.  One day someone will come up with one that<br/>is convincing and really speaks the music of the spheres and quantum wave music of the atoms.<br/>Till then, there is always the synergy of drugs and music to lift the mind out to the reaches<br/>of the universe---abstract or otherwise.  Also, I think that Arvo Part&apos;s &quot;Miserere&quot; is one hell<br/>of a cosmic vision.  Come to think of it, Wagner&apos;s &quot;Ring of the Nibelung&quot; is about the cosmic<br/>music.  And Holst&apos;s not so well written &quot;The Planets&quot;.  The best modern writer on this music<br/>religion is Schopenhauer.  His two volumes of The World as Will and Representation  (Payne<br/>translation) represents the summation of the mystical tradition regarding the harmonices<br/>mundi.  Nietzsche was the first person to test it.  He died insane.  But then again,<br/>Nietzsche&apos;s piano music is terrible (there&apos;s even a CD on it).  Maybe Monz won&apos;t go insane if<br/>he starts to hear the atoms and planets talking/singing.  I myself also didn&apos;t do so well when<br/>I started to hear that humming.  The universe doesn&apos;t like me.  That&apos;s Wagner&apos;s image, that<br/>Siegfried slays Fafner and drinks of that dragon&apos;s blood and then hears the music of creation.<br/>I think that dragon&apos;s blood might be poisonous and isn&apos;t such a good drink.  Maybe Monz can<br/>just cut the dragon&apos;s head off and make a wall trophy.  Don&apos;t drink the blood!  Just kidding.<br/>I think that drinking the blood of the dragon (the universe of cosmic music) is a part of the<br/>path.  Maybe when its your turn to take the drink like in the ancient myths that you get one of<br/>those countertop filtration systems like the Brita water filter pitcher.  Then the blood of<br/>creation would be safer to drink.  It&apos;s called the vision of Pan.  Pan, the goat god,<br/>Christians call the devil.  His panpipes of Bode&apos;s Law and the Pythagorean ratios.  He has<br/>horns and a fish tale (Capricornus).  A sort of primitive dragon.  Maybe its right to call him<br/>the devil.  But then again he is for all purposes the source of life we normally call Mother<br/>Nature and his music is Father Time.  A smart music hero can avoid Pan altogether and praise<br/>Apollo and his lyre.  That&apos;s a feat of a strong heart and purest morality and many aren&apos;t up to<br/>Apollo&apos;s standards.  So it&apos;s off to the dragon slaying myth.  And then the hero has to drink<br/>the blood to hear the song of creation and then blam!  You&apos;re reading Tolkien&apos;s &quot;Silmarillion&quot;<br/>and thinking of Wagner&apos;s Ring Cycle.<br/>Joesph Campbell&apos;s &quot;Masks of God&quot; is a very rich collection of these music based myths.  It&apos;s<br/>his underlying theme in those books.  Very enlightening if one was to try to wrestle with the<br/>creation and play its music.  I know I&apos;m gonna try it again.  Except that I&apos;m already a washed<br/>up experiment.  The trick is to get there and NOT go insane.  NOT GO INSANE.  And most<br/>importantly, don&apos;t go NEW AGEY.  Avoid insanity and avoid new agey music.  John Tesh and Yanni<br/>are just as bad as Nietzsche&apos;s hysterical insanity death and my frightful psychosis.  Actually<br/>though, John Tesh and Yanni are worse than insanity.</p><p>&gt; --<br/>&gt; * D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>&gt; * 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>&gt; * <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
