Would that be<br/>not a nice way to hear one??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d imagine so.</p><p>You can play an ascending scale from the Arpeggio window, click on the &gt;<br/>button. Ctrl + click on it to configure. You can try various figurations<br/>from there too.</p><p>To play it faster / slower, change the value in the Time for one note box in<br/>the main window.</p><p>For more serious exploring, I imagine where it could be useful is for<br/>playing along in the modes.</p><p>You can play in any of the modes from MIDI in using In | Options - try the<br/>presets to get started.</p><p>See for instance the 19 tone preset, with options for playing accidentals.</p><p>Also from Make New Seed, move mouse over keyboard picture and you can play<br/>along from p.c. keyboard.</p><p>From p.c. keyboard, you can play the mode from the second row, and the<br/>accidentals in top, third and fourth row. To set this up use Make New Seed |<br/>+...</p><p>I can add new things easily if there are some specific requests of things<br/>that will be useful.</p><p>I&apos;ve often added things myself as a result of learning about something in<br/>j.i. and wanting to try it out and hear what it sounds like.</p><p>Try &quot;string quintet&quot; to hear the fractal pattern clearly. Most of them use<br/>the same idea, varying the seed, however the way the notes are distributed<br/>amongst the instruments can completely hide it sometimes.</p><p>Some of the ones in the New drop list use fibonacci tonescapes - the pitch<br/>goes up and down by a ratio depending on the length of the note, and with no<br/>underlying scale as such. See for instance, cousin of the wind.</p><p>It&apos;s fractal music, rather than a conventional composition. Think of it as<br/>something like listening to and enjoying natural sounds perhaps?</p><p>:-)</p><p>Robert</p></div>
