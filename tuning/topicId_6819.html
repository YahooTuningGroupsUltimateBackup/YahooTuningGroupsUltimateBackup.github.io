Now that I&apos;ve said more than my<br/>share I will shut up after this: If we all had computers with software<br/>that would allow us to compose and record, even perform whatever was in<br/>our heads, this issue would be dead as far as the composer&apos;s wishes versus<br/>what he was able to present was concerned. All the contention would be<br/>over what was acceptable practice regarding messing with the composition.<br/>And it would be just as messy. Me mute now.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
