I would like to say how grateful I am to this man for his excellent articles in issues 13<br/>to 15 in particular of Xenharmonicon, the journal devoted to tuning and related issues. I bought<br/>the whole back catalogue from the Just Intonation Network and it is one of the best investments<br/>I&apos;ve made recently.</p><p>I would thoroughly recommend these journals to anyone who, like me is new or relatively new to the<br/>concepts and complexities of tuning as discussed by the experts (respectfully) on this list. I<br/>wouldn&apos;t expect everyone to preface a debate with an explanation of terms and it takes time to<br/>search the archives for related postings on various topics. Which is why the McLaren (and other)<br/>articles are so useful for information on mathematical methods of scale construction, equal<br/>temperaments and cycles of fifths, non just non equal scales and so on.</p><p>Since reading these articles I now have a much clearer understanding of a lot of the postings that<br/>were previously annoying the life out of me. AND I can use this knowledge to make music - good for<br/>the karma.</p><p>I think it is sometimes forgotten by those who have gained their knowledge through years of study<br/>and experience just how many mathematical terms and concepts there are to pin down in order to<br/>have a good working knowledge of the subject. Hence the opinion that you don&apos;t need that much<br/>mathamatics to get by. That&apos;s easy to say if you have the concepts fixed. Brian McLaren&apos;s articles<br/>are so valuable because they have the luxury of a few pages to give clear examples. So, wherever<br/>you are, Mr McLaren, thanks for the articles.</p><p>Now if its inspiration and zeal you want, let me recommend Mr Darreg.....................</p></div><h3><a id=21102 href="#21102">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2001 12:14:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Hello Alison,  thanks for the information on articles in<br/>Xenharmonicon.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=21225 href="#21225">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/17/2001 7:04:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_21097.html#21097">/tuning/topicId_21097.html#21097</a></p><p>&gt; The name Brian McLaren has popped up many times on this list often<br/>accompanied by gnashing of teeth.

However, he<br/>was a rather affable gentleman who kept shoving this old Russian book<br/>in Cyrillic at me.  Fortunately, I had just been to Russia, so could<br/>read a few words...  No problem on that end.</p><p>OF COURSE, I didn&apos;t try to get into a dispute with him about tuning...<br/>and I also, inadventently, missed *all* his lectures, since I was<br/>hanging out in the electronic &quot;listening room...&quot;</p><p>_______ _____ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
