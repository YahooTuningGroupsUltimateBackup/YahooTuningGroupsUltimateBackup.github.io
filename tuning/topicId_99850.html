What note can we add to turn it into a triad with consonance of a similar degree?  This note must not increase the repeat period of the original dyad.  In addition, we have to consider the difference tones; if the difference tones created from the addition of a third note compete with the original tones A and B, we have a problem.  However if the difference tones have frequencies A and B, they strengthen the original dyad.  The only note which meets the above conditions is the combination tone A+B.  It keeps the original repeat period of the dyad A:B, and its difference tones support the harmony.</p><p>(If A:B is irrational, the repeat period can be thought of as an abstract quality relating to the regularity of the dyad.  By adding the combination tone A+B the regularity of the resulting triad is maximized, even if there is no finite repeat period.)</p><p>Another hypothetical situation: consider the blackwood fifth of 720 cents, or 3/5 of an octave.  Following the previous procedure, we can turn this dyad into a triad of ideal consonance by simply adding the summation tone A+B.  In this case the combination tone is 2^(3/5)+1, or 1597.16 cents, about 10 cents sharper than a perfectly just major tenth.  Coincidentally this value is really close to the blackwood (20 equal) 400 cent third.</p><p>Some other triads using this procedure:</p><p>Using the 7-equal fifth:<br/>0, 685.71, [1576.58]</p><p>Using the 16-equal fifth:<br/>0, 675, [1570.19]</p><p>Using the mavila fourth:<br/>0, 522.86, [1481.09]</p><p>So, what do you guys think of creating scales using this technique?  I have a few ideas in mind.  Someone could possibly start with a rank-1 temperament, convert it into a rank-2 temperament using one of the combination tones as a second lattice axis, and then converting it back into another rank-1 temperament.</p><p>Advice and criticism would be appreciated.</p><p>-Ryan</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2011 8:40:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Jun 9, 2011 at 10:16 PM, domeofatonement<br/>&lt;domeofatonement@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey guys, I&apos;m a bit new here but i&apos;ve been on the XA facebook group for a while, so I&apos;m pretty sure some of you know me.

The reason that they are so<br/>awesome is that when you get into rationally intoned chords like the<br/>above, not only do the fundamentals of each chord beat in sync with<br/>one another (as you demanded with your A:B:A+B example), but if the<br/>overall chord is rational, all of the harmonics will also likewise<br/>beat in sync (assuming a harmonic timbre).</p><p>There&apos;s a lot more that can be squeezed out of this method, like<br/>finding ways to detune or temper these chords in the least<br/>perceptually disruptive way possible, but I haven&apos;t worked it out yet.<br/>If you find the idea interesting maybe it&apos;s time to resurrect that<br/>line of inquiry.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>domeofatonement &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2011 9:11:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Ryan is the man, except he seems to suggest above that the 91/90 biome<br/>&gt; temperament is weird, whereas it is actually awesome.

In<br/>fact, please go right ahead and investigate it more - all I wanted to<br/>do was give you some theoretical background on what might be going on.<br/>In fact, this topic has been the subject of some contentious debate<br/>recently, with Carl proposing instead that the behavior generated is<br/>more in the brain, although he hasn&apos;t put out a concrete hypothesis to<br/>test yet (I&apos;ve offered to generate listening examples to test it when<br/>he does). But either way, there is something magical about frequencies<br/>that are linearly spaced from one another, and I think it could lead<br/>to lots of improvements in how we handle tuning error if someone could<br/>go into it a bit more.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that anyone&apos;s suggested the rank-2 -&gt; rank-3 approach<br/>you laid out above, although again I&apos;m not sure how perceptually<br/>significant &quot;true&quot; combination tones are, as they often tend to get<br/>confused with AM in this case (and even more often get confused with<br/>VF processing). To me, the greatest asset in putting a chord into a<br/>linearly-spaced arrangement is that it evokes &quot;periodicity&quot; buzz,<br/>which if you understood my above explanation isn&apos;t related to<br/>periodicity at all. But if you create something that sounds good, then<br/>I don&apos;t care if it comes from critical band effects or inner-ear<br/>nonlinearities.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
