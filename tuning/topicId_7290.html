In general, he experienced the &quot;high<br/>&gt;third&quot; as being considerably higher than Pythagorean. He played it for me<br/>&gt;over the phone (remember those?) and it is indeed the third that I commonly<br/>&gt;hear as the &quot;singer&apos;s third.&quot;</p><p>My CD is not yet finished, but I&apos;ve decided to go ahead and post my results<br/>now. The high third is 9/7 relative to the root. Here&apos;s the experiment I<br/>did with my guitar to confirm that conclusion:</p><p>        Tune the sixth string to E.</p><p>        Tune the first string to the double octave of the sixth string.</p><p>        Tune the second string a perfect fourth below the first string.<br/>        Check by matching the harmonic on the second string over the fifth<br/>        fret with the harmonic on the first string over the seventh fret.</p><p>        Tune the harmonic of the fourth string over the fifth fret to the<br/>        seventh harmonic of the sixth string (found about one third of the way<br/>        back from the third fret toward the send fret).</p><p>        Tune the fifth string a perfect fourth below the fourth string by<br/>        matching the harmonic on the fourth string over the seventh fret with<br/>        the harmonic of the fifth string over the fifth fret.</p><p>        Tune the third string to a just major third above the fourth string<br/>        by matching the harmonic on the third string over the fourth fret<br/>        with the harmonic on the fourth string over the fourth fret.</p><p>When all of the above are simultaneously satisfied, then the third, fourth,<br/>and fifth strings will form a D-major triad tuned 3:4:5. The high third is<br/>found by playing the harmonic on the second string over the seventh fret.</p><p>Although I haven&apos;t performed Jerry&apos;s experiment with singers, I knew that I<br/>had found the high third that he reported here on the tuning list (and also<br/>on page 70 of his book &quot;Lies My Music Teacher Told Me&quot;) by playing the<br/>harmonics over the fifth fret on strings 5,4, and 3, in that order, and<br/>thinking (and then singing along) &quot;From this valley&quot; from &quot;Red River<br/>Valley&quot;, and then repeating the sequence but replacing the third note with<br/>the harmonic on the second string over the seventh fret. I was even more<br/>strongly convinced by playing the harmonics over the fifth fret on strings<br/>4 and 3, in that order, and thinking (and then singing along) &quot;You can&apos;t&quot;<br/>from the Rolling Stones &quot;You Can&apos;t Always Get What You Want&quot;. I don&apos;t have<br/>a recording of that tune but my recollection is that Mick Jagger sang the<br/>9/7 third and not the 5/4.</p><p>Surprise, surprise, surprise: major triad tuned 14:18:21! Seven is not just<br/>for the seventh of a dominant 7th chord.</p><p>More to come.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div>
