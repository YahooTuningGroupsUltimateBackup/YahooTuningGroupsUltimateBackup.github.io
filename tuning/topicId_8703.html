Wow. [&amp; golly, gee wiz, etc...]</p><p>However, I must confess that my observations were &quot;flavored&quot; by the use of<br/>a poor sound card at &quot;work...&quot;  [yes, I also got my DMA, but ended up<br/>having to.... blah, blah]</p><p>Well, anyway, I figured out, *FINALLY* how to get the files to play through<br/>my AWE64 sound card... probably pretty similar to the card that Joe Monzo<br/>was using to create them.  The problem before was the fact that I never<br/>thought to play the sound card through the *sequencer!*  Duh!  I was using<br/>some little MIDI utility with the computer.  No wonder the card wouldn&apos;t<br/>bend properly!</p><p>Now, however, I believe I have an accurate representation of the files.</p><p>I am doing what I can to forget *everything* I have thought about the<br/>files, and also the comments by both tuning Sysop (almost! -- remember<br/>those early on-line forum days??) Paul Erlich and Joe Monzo.  This is not<br/>difficult to do, since my memory is rather poor anyway.</p><p>So we will try to begin with a &quot;tabula rasa.&quot;  Yup.  Not difficult.</p><p>The adaptive JI example devised by David Keenen [BTW I&apos;m really missing him<br/>and especially Monz... hope they come back soon!] seemed about the most<br/>natural of the JI&apos;s -- however I found the V-7 chord sounding a little<br/>&quot;pinched.&quot;  Is that the smaller third??... well probably the whole 4:5 and<br/>4:7.  Not bad, though... I could certainly get used to it...</p><p>The good ol&apos; 12-tET... well, I&apos;m so used to hearing this version that I can<br/>hardly hear it at all anymore!  Certainly the third seemed *very* large on<br/>the V-7.  After hearing so many other things these days, I personally don&apos;t<br/>like it very much any more.  I&apos;m sure that makes a lot of difference to a<br/>lot of people...</p><p>The 5 limit 9:16 [you are *SO* right as always P. Erlich, I had omitted<br/>it!] is actually not so bad for me...For me it seems fairly similar to the<br/>Keenan.  Is it?? I&apos;m not getting the math here... I need a quick<br/>&quot;rundown..&quot;</p><p>The 5 limit 5:9 is really terrible.  The V-7 is awful.  I think almost<br/>everyone agrees on this one...  I don&apos;t know mathematically why this is so<br/>bad.  I guess 27/20 is a pretty &quot;big number&quot; ratio in this context...  I<br/>guess the &quot;new&quot; &quot;adaptive&quot; one that Keenan devised and Monz never got to<br/>would raise *all* the members of the IV chord +7.2 cents, and *lower* the<br/>V-7 by -7.2 cents.  It would be pretty kuhl to hear that one...</p><p>With the system I am now using, I have to concur that the 7-limit is<br/>schlectikeit. Pooh. No dig.  The transition between the V-7 is really not<br/>smooth...  I revise my previous opinions... based, I believe on<br/>equipmental, rather than &quot;operator&quot; error...</p><p>The Pythagorean this time came off very similar to the 12-tET.  I guess<br/>that&apos;s not terribly surprising...  The third of the V-7 seemed *terribly*<br/>large though.</p><p>And the last entry, the &quot;historically graced&quot; 1/4 comma-m-t...  Well, this<br/>time the thirds seemed a little small, cramped to me.  However, I have the<br/>feeling I could &quot;get used to&quot; it.  Certainly the overall quality of the<br/>progression seems smooth and balanced.</p><p>AND THE WINNER IS:  ta da... Keenan Adaptive JI  and 5 limit just 9:16!!!</p><p>_________________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
