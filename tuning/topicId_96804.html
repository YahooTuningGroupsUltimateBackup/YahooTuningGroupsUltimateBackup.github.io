Start<br/>&gt; with JI.  Imagine a scale where the only note is a 1/1--no octaves, even.<br/>&gt;  This is a 0-dimensional scale.  We can&apos;t get any other notes because 1 to<br/>&gt; any power is always 1.  Now add a 2nd interval, any interval will do but<br/>&gt; let&apos;s say 2/1 for convention&apos;s sake.  We now have a 1-dimensional scale,<br/>&gt; because we can go up or down from 1/1 by powers of 2/1.  Adding another<br/>&gt; interval---3/1, for instance--gets us to a 2-dimensional tuning-space where<br/>&gt; we can move along either or both of two axes (powers of 2 and/or powers of<br/>&gt; 3).  Adding another interval--5/1, say--gets us to a 3-dimensional space.<br/>&gt;  Every time we add an interval that is not expressible as some combination<br/>&gt; of the intervals we already have, we are adding a dimension to tuning space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In JI, all the dimensions of tuning space are open and &quot;flat&quot; and<br/>&gt; infinite--you can move as far as you want along any combination of them and<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll never return to the origin.  When we temper, we are essentially<br/>&gt; &quot;folding&quot; or &quot;curling&quot; tuning space in such a way that it becomes possible<br/>&gt; to return to the origin of 1/1 by moving a finite number of steps along some<br/>&gt; dimensions/axes.  This happens because we equate an interval (usually a<br/>&gt; comma) with 1/1 so that that comma ceases to exist--it becomes &quot;one&quot; with<br/>&gt; the unison.  I think of this in terms of &quot;fudging&quot; the rules of math so that<br/>&gt; two distinct numbers become equated--it&apos;s like we&apos;re defining a universe in<br/>&gt; which 2+2=5.  What this also does is equate movement along one dimension<br/>&gt; with movement along other dimensions.  IOW, with the example of meantone<br/>&gt; temperament, we can now get to places on the 5 axis by moving only along the<br/>&gt; 2 and 3 axes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This where mappings come in: depending on the comma we temper out, we will<br/>&gt; create different rules for movement in our folded space.  A mapping is<br/>&gt; nothing more than a set of directions that tells you how far you far you<br/>&gt; have to go along the available axes of your tempered tuning space to get to<br/>&gt; the places that existed in the untempered tuning space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a rank-2 temperament, we have only two axes: the period and the<br/>&gt; generator.  When we give a mapping for the temperament, as determined by the<br/>&gt; comma, one way to give it is by giving a val for each axis such that the two<br/>&gt; vals together are coordinates that correspond (usually) to the successive<br/>&gt; primes.  A rank-2 temperament can be derived from any level of JI<br/>&gt; dimensionality, but we will have to temper out more commas in order to<br/>&gt; reduce higher dimensions down to two.  For instance, we can give 5-limit<br/>&gt; meantone with the two vals &lt;1 1 0] and &lt;0 1 4], where the first val is the<br/>&gt; period, the second is the generator.  Taking the first number from each val,<br/>&gt; we have the coordinate (1, 0) or &quot;one period up, zero generators up&quot;, and<br/>&gt; that is how we get to 2/1.  The second number from each val gives (1, 1), or<br/>&gt; &quot;one period up, one generator up&quot; and that gets us to 3/1.  The third<br/>&gt; numbers give (0, 4) or &quot;zero periods up, four generators up&quot; and that gets<br/>&gt; us to 5/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can reduce rank-2 temperaments to rank-1 temperaments, which are equal<br/>&gt; tunings (though not necessarily EDOs), by further tempering out another<br/>&gt; comma.  Any time we temper out a comma, we reduce the dimensionality of<br/>&gt; tuning-space.  Doing this means we can specify the mapping with a single<br/>&gt; val, and our generator is always going to be one step of the equal scale.<br/>&gt;  So the 5-limit val for 12-TET would be &lt;12 19 28]; a rank-1 val is also<br/>&gt; known as a &quot;Breed&quot;.  Of course, we can give mappings for tunings that are<br/>&gt; not the most accurate mappings; for 7-EDO, we could map 5/1 to its perfect<br/>&gt; 4th rather than its neutral 3rd, and give a val of &lt;7 11 17].  A &quot;patent<br/>&gt; val&quot; is the val that corresponds to the most accurate mapping of JI to steps<br/>&gt; of an ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does that help?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, the whole random naming thing--this used to bother the crap out of<br/>&gt; me, but I&apos;ve since come to accept that with the plethora of things that need<br/>&gt; naming, there&apos;s no good clear logical way to go about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
