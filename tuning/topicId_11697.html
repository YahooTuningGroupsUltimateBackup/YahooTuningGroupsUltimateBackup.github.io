However, I&apos;m still pretty<br/>&gt;unsure exactly what this is actually modeling, or saying... because as<br/>&gt;you said, &quot;the otonal 7-limit tetrad is clearly more concordant than<br/>&gt;this ranking implies, which reflects the fact that this model ignores<br/>&gt;synergies between three or more notes. A true triadic or tetradic<br/>&gt;harmonic entropy model (rather than a sum of dyadic harmonic entropy<br/>&gt;models, which is what this is) would take this into account.&quot; So<br/>&gt;exactly what does this sort of a &quot;sum of dyadic harmonic entropy<br/>&gt;models&quot; say/mean?</p><p>(1) Since dyadic harmonic entropy looks very much like dyadic roughness for<br/>a certain choice of timbre and register, and since, according to Kameoka and<br/>Kuriyagawa, roughness of chords _is_ a simple sum of the roughnesses of the<br/>dyads, what we have here is a proxy for tetradic roughness.</p><p>(2) If you _do_ play the notes of the tetrad only two at a time, and choose<br/>all pairs with equal frequency/probability, you have a good measure of the<br/>expected harmonic entropy of the resulting music. This is the interpretation<br/>that I would lean toward when I find these local minima, as I plan to do<br/>(with different methods), for sets of considerably more than four notes<br/>(i.e., scales rather than chords).</p><p>David Finnamore wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt; The next most concordant tetrad was:<br/>&gt;&gt; 0          498          886         1384&cent;<br/>&gt;&gt; or 9:12:15:20 or 1/1:4/3:5/3:20/9. It is an open-voiced JI minor seventh<br/>&gt;&gt; chord in third inversion, or an open-voiced JI major added sixth chord in<br/>&gt;&gt; second inversion.</p><p>&gt;Sound familiar, fellow guitarists?  I learned that tetrad at age 7 on the<br/>&gt;ukulele as, &quot;My dog has fleas.&quot;  But, of course, it&apos;s also the<br/>(approximate) &gt;standard tuning of the lowest four strings on the guitar.<br/>How did ye olde &gt;guitar and ukulele players know how to do that without a<br/>supercomputer?  Tee &gt;hee.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you do tune the lowest (highest in pitch) four strings on<br/>the guitar exactly like that, and tune the other two in successive 4:3<br/>fourths, your lowest string will be a comma off from your highest string.</p><p>&gt;Paul, I _love_ the graphic you posted for triads (enttriad.jpg).  I just<br/>can&apos;t &gt;quit staring at it!</p><p>If there&apos;s any particular slice through the tetradic solid you&apos;d like me<br/>graph, let me know.</p></div><h3><a id=11719 href="#11719">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2000 8:45:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

Unfortunately, I can&apos;t do the<br/>&gt;calculations at the moment, because, though Matlab can give you the set<br/>&gt;of line segments making up the full spread of Voronoi cells for a set<br/>&gt;of points, it provides no way to then find just the edges of the<br/>&gt;Voronoi cell corresponding to a single, selected point. Perhaps I just<br/>&gt;need the help of a clever programmer on this list . . .</p><p>OK, I&apos;ll bite, Paul.  I&apos;m a programmer, and potentially clever enough,<br/>and I have a native C++ compiler with no arbitrary limitations such as<br/>you seem to have to put up with.</p><p>Could you send me some quasi-readable source code for the binary<br/>calculations you do, that I could port over to C++ without having to<br/>study &quot;Farley&quot; thingamagigs in great detail?  That&apos;d help.  Then, those<br/>&quot;Voronoi cells&quot;: got any pseudo-code on that?  My fear is that it&apos;d be<br/>a tar-pit of confusion.  I don&apos;t always delve deeply into these<br/>numerical games on the list, BUT I have to admit I&apos;m intrigued by the<br/>potential results of the task.  Surely 4:5:6:7 would float toward the<br/>top compared to the myriad of chords that &quot;beat&quot; it in the binary<br/>summation calculation!</p><p>Am I correct in thinking that the more refined method would in effect<br/>calculate difference frequencies and consider them in the more<br/>complete effect?</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=11827 href="#11827">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

That&apos;s why I said &quot;approximate.&quot;  Also, by &quot;lower&quot; I meant the 4 closest to the floor, not the ones lowest in pitch.  Always a source of confusion with guitars!  So what I meant to point out was that the standard D-G-B-E tuning of the 4 highest-pitched guitar strings approximates the tetrad that was found most consonant by your program.  I found that very interesting.</p><p>--<br/>David J. Finnamore<br/>Nashville, TN, USA<br/><a href="http://members.xoom.com/dfinn.1">http://members.xoom.com/dfinn.1</a><br/>--</p></div>
