Couper was born in Buenos Aires in 1887<br/>and lived in Europe as a child until her family emigrated to the United States<br/>in 1915 at the outbreak of WWI. She taught piano at the Mannes School in New<br/>York for several years and then moved to California in 1927. After establishing<br/>her studio in Santa Barbara she started writing quarter-tone music. Her first<br/>work in this medium was a ballet, &quot;Xanadu,&quot; which was performed in the<br/>production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Marco Millions&quot; in the Lobero Theatre in 1930.<br/>Scores to three of Mildred Coupers quarter tone works, the &quot;Dirge,&quot; for violin<br/>and piano, &quot;Rumba,&quot; for two pianos, &quot;Xanadu,&quot; for two pianos are now online and<br/>are available for research and study. Couper&apos;s papers are housed in the<br/>Department of Special Collections. The scores were scanned and placed online by<br/>Oberlin College Winter Term intern Rebecca Thompson.</p><p><a href="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/pamss45.html">http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/pamss45.html</a><br/>[<a href="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/pamss45.html">http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/pamss45.html</a>]</p><p>Jeffrey Gordon, Performing Arts Assistant<br/>Davidson Library Special Collections<br/>University of California<br/>Santa Barbara, CA 93106<br/>(805) 893-5444 Fax (805) 893-5749</p></div>
