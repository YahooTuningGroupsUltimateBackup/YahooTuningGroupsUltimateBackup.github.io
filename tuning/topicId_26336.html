As I have repeatedly said, you<br/>&gt; do TERRIFIC work, and not a moment of time you spend on it is a<br/>&gt; waste....  You provide a valuable service to this entire community!</p><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>Thanks a bunch... glad you like it so much.  Now *THAT&apos;S* a chord!</p><p>(Ken Fasano, who wrote all of the functional JustMusic code so far,<br/>wrote to me a couple of years ago about that chord, something<br/>screamingly funny along the lines of &quot;... so Mahler&apos;s music is<br/>going along and... WHOA! what the !#$%^&amp; was that?!  Does he<br/>think he&apos;s Lutoslawski?&quot;...)</p><p>Now that I&apos;ve found out that Mahler was a fan of meantone,<br/>I&apos;m *really* clueless as to what he was thinking when he wrote<br/>*this*!  Notice, tho, that the highest 4 notes of the chord<br/>are a (8ve-equivalent) semitone higher than the diminished-7th<br/>chord that is repeated in two of the lower registers.  My &quot;closest<br/>rational approximation&quot; of the 12-EDO hints that perhaps he was<br/>thinking in terms of some form of stretched tuning.</p><p>Remember that this symphony was written during Summer 1910,<br/>*after* Mahler had taken the score of Schoenberg&apos;s _2nd Quartet_<br/>(whose last movement was the first piece written without being<br/>in a key) with him to America, to &quot;study ... from time to time&quot;.<br/>So there&apos;s a very good chance that Schoenberg&apos;s early &quot;atonal&quot;<br/>ideas were having quite an impact on Mahler at this point.<br/>Mahler confessed as early as 1906 that he could no longer<br/>follow Schoenberg&apos;s development, but he continued to support<br/>Schoenberg artistically and financially until practically<br/>his dying breath (&quot;Who&apos;s going to take care of poor Schoenberg<br/>now that I&apos;m gone?&quot;).</p><p>See my &quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a><br/>for all the fascinating details.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
