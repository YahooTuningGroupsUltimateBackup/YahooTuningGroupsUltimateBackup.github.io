We may be on virgin territory!</p><p>?  Wilson has played with more generators than I&apos;d care to shake a stick at.  He is especially fond of irrational ones, if you&apos;ve heard _From on High_ or talked to Marcus about the tunings.  He has these iterative formulas which converge on generators that give certain properties to the scale --- often difference tone properties, ala meta-meantone.</p><p>Wilson told me, with a grin a mile wide, that one of his favorite things in the world is varying the size of the generator and observing the points where the harmonic approximations rearrange on the linear series.

I was just thinking the other day, that the Stern-Brocot tree (aka Farey tree, scale tree...) has got to be the most important structure in all of music theory.  When applied to frequencies, it gives the best map of dyadic consonance there is (might as well define consonance for harmonic timbres).  When applied to logarithms of frequencies, it gives the best lexicon of melodic resources there is (yet).</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=4215 href="#4215">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/1999 9:53:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>For those confused about MOS, here&apos;s something I&apos;ve<br/>emailed privately to a few people, which I learned<br/>first-hand from Carl Lumma.</p><p>**********************************************<br/>DISCLAIMER:</p><p>I EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS ONLY MY VERSION OF IT.<br/>Erv Wilson is adamant that his work should stand as<br/>he wrote it and speak for itself.  But I find that<br/>this explanation helps make the whole thing much clearer.<br/>Hope it helps the rest of you who are struggling with<br/>this.  Keep reading the Wilson Archives at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>There may be stuff in this post that is just plain wrong<br/>- corrections are appreciated.<br/>************************************************</p><p>MOS stands for &quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; (a really<br/>lovely title), and was discovered in the<br/>1960s by Erv Wilson.</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html</a><br/>is the letter describing MOS.</p><p>The first thing to take note of is that<br/>Wilson always uses his theories and<br/>diagrams to depict ideas of complete<br/>generality.  He will sometimes use specific<br/>ratios in his beautiful mandala-like<br/>lattice diagrams, but it is always<br/>assumed that they can representent any<br/>kind of set of anything.</p><p>The idea behind MOS is that it links<br/>together two different ways we listen<br/>to or perceive music:</p><p>1) the sonance of the interval (i.e.,<br/>    its harmonicity).</p><p>2) how many scale degrees the intervals<br/>    subtend (Wilson&apos;s word, I think;<br/>    it kind of means &quot;passes over&quot;<br/>    or &quot;is divided into&quot;).</p><p>Harmonic listening is bound to force one<br/>to think in terms of ratios, while scalar<br/>listening encourages thinking in terms<br/>of &quot;steps&quot; (unequal or equal).</p><p>In the diatonic scale, all &quot;5th&quot;s are fixed<br/>to the perception of a 3/2 (what Wilson calls<br/>the &quot;3-function&quot;), except for the last one<br/>(the &quot;tritone&quot;).</p><p>The &quot;3rd&quot;s are fixed to the &quot;5-function&quot;,<br/>but not as rigidly as the &quot;5th&quot;s are to 3/2:<br/>the &quot;3rd&quot;s may be either &quot;major&quot; (5/4)<br/>or &quot;minor&quot;(6/5).</p><p>His concept of MOS gives us a neat diatonic<br/>way of relating the two modes of listening.<br/>Now on to the details . . .</p><p>-------------------</p><p>MOS assumes octave-equivalency, and is<br/>based on a linear mapping of notes, for<br/>example, a Pythagorean JI system (open),<br/>or 12-(or other-)Eq (closed).  It has<br/>2 basic intervals: one called a &quot;generator&quot;<br/>and another which acts as octave-reducer.</p><p>The generator is an interval which is<br/>cycled thru at more-or-less the same size,<br/>to create all the different notes in the<br/>system (for instance, a &quot;5th&quot;; we need not<br/>specify the tuning).  The octave-reducer<br/>is typically 2/1, as in most music theories.</p><p>I&apos;m deliberately going to fudge the<br/>discrepancy between JI and ET in this<br/>description - trust me, it will make<br/>things easier.  Start by imagining a circle . . .</p><p>(You should draw it yourself on paper as<br/>I describe it - that helps a lot to<br/>understanding it.)</p><p>&lt;I&apos;ll wait, go get your pencil . . .&gt;</p><p>OK, start by drawing a circle to represent<br/>the octave, 1/1 at the top (12 o&apos;clock).<br/>We&apos;ll use approximate clock positions just<br/>to keep things simple.  Just put a tick<br/>mark on the circumference of the circle<br/>and label it for each note as we progress.</p><p>The first &quot;5th&quot; takes us to 3/2, 7 o&apos;clock<br/>the second &quot;5th&quot; to 9/8, 2 o&apos;clock<br/>the third &quot;5th&quot; to 27/16, 9 o&apos;clock<br/>the fourth &quot;5th&quot; to 81/64, 4 o&apos;clock . . .</p><p>Hell, let&apos;s switch to prime-factor notation,<br/>and give them the typical musical letter-names<br/>too.  So, that&apos;s:</p><p>   C  3^ 0 at 12:00<br/>   G  3^ 1 at  7:00<br/>   D  3^ 2 at  2:00<br/>   A  3^ 3 at  9:00<br/>Fb/E  3^ 4 at  4:00<br/>Cb/B  3^ 5 at 11:00<br/>Gb/F# 3^ 6 at  6:00<br/>Db/C# 3^ 7 at  1:00<br/>Ab/G# 3^ 8 at  8:00<br/>Eb/D# 3^ 9 at  3:00<br/>Bb/A# 3^10 at 10:00<br/>F /E# 3^11 at  5:00<br/>C /B# 3^12 at 12:00,</p><p>which means we&apos;ve completed the cycle<br/>if we&apos;re in 12-Eq (or its Pythagorean<br/>near-miss).  (But this process can be<br/>carried out much further, and Wilson<br/>did . . .)</p><p>Now, here&apos;s my definition of Moment<br/>of Symmetry (MOS):  it&apos;s when every<br/>&quot;link&quot; in the chain *subtends the same<br/>number of steps*, even if the last link<br/>is not exactly the same size as the others.<br/>I can only illustrate by way of our circle.</p><p>The first example doesn&apos;t have to be drawn -<br/>it&apos;s trivial.  It would be a chain of 2 links,<br/>going from C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00) and<br/>back again.  The only notes in the system<br/>are C and G.  Obviously 2 is a MOS, because<br/>each link subtends 1 &quot;step&quot;.  The 1st step<br/>is a &quot;5th&quot;, (to 7:00) and the 2nd step is a<br/>&quot;4th&quot;, bringing us back to the origin C (12:00)<br/>or &quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>If you&apos;re clever, you should have the idea<br/>already.  If not, like me, go ahead and<br/>draw each example as I describe it.<br/>(Draw that last one if you need to.)<br/>Remember that &quot;step&quot; only refers to the<br/>*number of steps in, and the specific<br/>steps derived from, THAT division*.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to draw many circles now, one<br/>for each division, to discover which ones<br/>are a MOS and which are not.  Do that.</p><p>The division into 3 goes like this:<br/>1st link C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00).<br/>2nd link G 3^1 ( 7:00) to D 3^2 (2:00).<br/>3rd link D 3^2 ( 2:00) back to C 3^0 (12:00).<br/>Thus our system is made up of C, D, and G.</p><p>The 1st link subtends 2 steps: C-D and D-G.<br/>The 2nd link subtends 2 steps: G-C and C-D.<br/>The 3rd link subtends 2 steps: D-G and G-C.<br/>Therefore 3 is also a MOS.</p><p>Division into 4:<br/>1st link C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00).<br/>2nd link G 3^1 ( 7:00) to D 3^2 (2:00).<br/>3rd link D 3^2 ( 2:00) to A 3^3 (9:00).<br/>4th link A 3^3 ( 9:00) back to C 3^0 (12:00).<br/>Our system is made up of C, D, G, and A.</p><p>1st link subtends 2 steps: C-D and D-G.<br/>2nd link subtends 3 steps: G-A, A-C, and C-D.<br/>3rd link subtends 2 steps: D-G and G-A.<br/>4th link subtends 1 step:  A-C.<br/>The steps sizes are not all the same,<br/>so 4 is *not* a MOS.</p><p>Division into 5:<br/>1st link C 3^0 (12:00) to G 3^1 (7:00).<br/>2nd link G 3^1 ( 7:00) to D 3^2 (2:00).<br/>3rd link D 3^2 ( 2:00) to A 3^3 (9:00).<br/>4th link A 3^3 ( 9:00) to E 3^4 (4:00).<br/>5th link E 3^4 ( 4:00) back to C 3^0 (12:00).<br/>Our system is made up of C, D, E, G, and A.</p><p>1st link subtends 3 steps: C-D, D-E, and E-G.<br/>2nd link subtends 3 steps: G-A, A-C, and C-D.<br/>3rd link subtends 3 steps: D-E, E-G, and G-A.<br/>4th link subtends 3 steps: A-C, C-D, and D-E.<br/>5 is a MOS.</p><p>I&apos;ll skip the rest - you can draw them yourself.<br/>6 is *not* a MOS,<br/>7 is a MOS,<br/>8, 9, 10, and 11 are *not* a MOS,<br/>12 is a MOS.</p><p>Scales below 5 notes are considered<br/>insignificant, so I will use Wilson&apos;s notation.</p><p>For positive mapping, that is, a system that<br/>has &quot;5th&quot;s that are 3/2s [= 702.0 cents] or<br/>wider, you get a MOS at<br/>(1, 2, 3,) 5, 7, 12, 17, 29, and 41.<br/>These include the following ETs:</p><p>#degrees  size of &quot;5th&quot; in cents<br/>  17        706<br/>  29        703<br/>  41        702.4</p><p>For negative mapping, a system with &quot;5th&quot;s<br/>narrower than a 3/2, we get a MOS at<br/>(1, 2, 3,) 5, 7, 12, 19, and 31.<br/>These include the following ETs:</p><p>#degrees  size of &quot;5th&quot; in cents<br/>  12        700<br/>  19        695<br/>  31        697</p><p>Scales with more than 41 are not considered<br/>necessary (I can&apos;t remember why now -<br/>ask Lumma).</p><p>That&apos;s MOS.<br/>------------------<br/>A little further on in your study of Wilson,<br/>you&apos;ll find that in his article &quot;On the<br/>Development of Intonational Systems by Extended<br/>Linear Mapping&quot; he recommends taking advantage<br/>of the fact that the 12-tone scale allows<br/>us to perceive either positive or negative<br/>mapping, to switch from the current negative<br/>mapping to one which is positive and<br/>&quot;acoustically advantageous&quot;.</p><p>He only discusses the cultural imprinting<br/>of the dual mapping on our consciousness in<br/>relation to the 12-tone scale, but it seems<br/>to me that dual mapping would already be<br/>ingrained from the previous historical use<br/>of both the 5-tone and 7-tone scales, both<br/>of which are MOS in both mappings.  (I&apos;m<br/>not sure tho - I&apos;d have to explore it a lot<br/>more.  Maybe you can see it.)</p><p>- Monzo</p><p>Joseph L.

I apologize if I&apos;ve been (or continue to be) long winded.  If<br/>anyone is still interested I&apos;ll post my equations for calculating the<br/>efficiency of any MOS, which are almost finished (in the case where the<br/>scale is strictly proper, the efficiency depends only on m, the number of<br/>tones in the scale, and for the merely proper case, there&apos;s a difficult<br/>equation depending on m and also n, the number of tones in the system.)<br/>&#x9;We&apos;re almost down to barefaced opinions now, so I&apos;ll just clarify a couple<br/>of my own tenative opinions.</p><p>Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;So you&apos;re saying that _all_ scales are perceptually forced into the<br/>&gt;lowest equal temperament which gives a good fit? That kind of assumption<br/>&gt;may sit well with theorists like Balzano and Clough-Carey-Clampitt,<br/>&gt;who&apos;ve &quot;explained&quot; a lot of things on these sorts of bases, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;buy it, not one bit -- there&apos;s always a better, more acoustical<br/>&gt;explanation, with fewer arbitrary assumptions.</p><p>&#x9;I think acoustical explainations definitely have their place.  I believe<br/>that sensory consonance, which has a clear physical basis which has been<br/>studied extensively by Plomp et al, plays a role in harmony.  But sound<br/>acoustical explainations of music, at present, are mostly limited to<br/>sensory consonance.  Models which explain premises of music theory on a<br/>pysiological/neurological basis, such as Terhardt&apos;s, are interesting but<br/>speculative.  There&apos;s much more to music theory and tuning theory than<br/>sensory consonance unless the variety of meanings of consonance which James<br/>Tenney outlines in his book are all ultimately reducible to sensory<br/>consonance, a shaky theory at best.</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&gt;Equal temperament is a contrivance that offers many great benefits, but I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t believe it is of perceptual origin (though in the _particular_ case<br/>&gt;of the Pythagorean scale the fit to 12 is so good that it is hard to<br/>&gt;avoid, even perceptually).</p><p>&#x9;I agree, if you mean, equal tunings considered as sets of irrational<br/>frequency ratios aren&apos;t perceptually real.  I have meant to emphasize<br/>(although I have been less than clear) that I&apos;m not looking at ET&apos;s<br/>considered as such, but at divisions of the 8ve into some number of<br/>categories.  Equal temperment is nothing more than a keyboard or lute<br/>tuning designed to produce 12 equally (sensory) consonant major and minor<br/>triads.</p><p>I said:<br/>&gt;&gt;Yes, and this fact gives us a useful method of finding the generator of<br/>&gt;&gt;the scale at any step of the process.  But here&apos;s where I cash in on the<br/>&gt;&gt;observation above that each choice of a previous number of places to go<br/>&gt;&gt;back to find the number to add to the last, given the weak criterion,<br/>&gt;&gt;gives a unique l:s in the following scale: to explain the value of the<br/>&gt;&gt;strong criteria.  If the choice is always 1, then l:s is always 2:1.</p><p>And you said:<br/>&gt;??? Actually, it approaches 1:phi, unless you&apos;re dealing with a<br/>Yasser-&gt;type situation where you use an equal temperament which is chosen<br/>by &gt;using the next term in the sequence (i.e., using an additional &quot;choice<br/>of &gt;1&quot;).</p><p>This point actually requires a much more extensive explaination than I<br/>gave.  Let&apos;s just look at one alternative, for simplicity: going back 2<br/>steps rather than one.  Say I&apos;ve started a sequence (2), 3, 5, 8, 13.  At<br/>the last step of the sequence I have a system of 13 notes and 13 interval<br/>categories, and if I exhaust that system, I have a scale 1111111111111 (in<br/>terms of interval categories).  I also have the 8 note scale 21221212.  The<br/>next choice is a choice in extending the number of categories, and<br/>according to our limitations, I can extend it to 21 or 18.  With the former<br/>choice,  My 8-note scale becomes 32332323, which implies than my 13 note<br/>scale becomes 2122121221221.  In the latter case my 8-note scale becomes<br/>31331313, and the 13-note scale 2112121121121.  Of course, l:s is always<br/>going to reduce to 2:1, I should have been contrasting the proportions of<br/>the 8-note scales, 3:2 and 3:1.  These proportions translate into the 2nd<br/>level of structure in the 13-t scale.  The situation becomes more<br/>complicated as the next system becomes smaller: I need to study this<br/>problem further.  Suffice it to say that the scales become less stable as<br/>the next system becomes smaller, which I think is evident.</p><p>&#x9;Let me make one more point which I think I have not made clear yet.  We&apos;re<br/>becoming confused as to whether I&apos;m talking about scales tuned in some ET,<br/>or according to the reiteration of some irrational generator.  Actually I&apos;m<br/>talking about neither.  Let&apos;s look at it this way: the scale forms I&apos;m<br/>proposing expressed as interval categories could include an infinite number<br/>of scales expressed in terms of cents or freq ratio (I&apos;m changing the<br/>terminology here).  A number of non-equal intervals of these scales will<br/>fall into the same interval category given some translation.  My<br/>supposition, then, is that the interval categories are more perceptually<br/>relevant in many respects than the exact freq ratios.  To a some extent<br/>this _has_ to be true because we can only detect a certain degree of<br/>precision in freq.</p><p>&#x9;Also, I don&apos;t know if this discussion has been seen as heated, but let me<br/>say that at no point in it have I felt heated.  I value challenges to my<br/>opinions as well as mathematical corrections as I&apos;m sure very few final<br/>words have yet been spoken.</p><p>jason</p></div><h3><a id=24011 href="#24011">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@matavnet.hu&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2001 10:48:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; Did Erv every specifically mention any MOS scales that repeat at<br/>&gt; the half-octave?</p><p>I&apos;ve posted about this more than once in the past.
