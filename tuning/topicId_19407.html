It&apos;s as if they are deeply afraid that a<br/>bit of technical explanation will somehow take away the magic of music-making,<br/>rather than deepen the experience.</p><p>Paradoxically, it is often the same musicians who come up with and insist upon<br/>the most patent nonsense (i.e. a recent post wanted to claim some correspondance<br/>between the 127th partial and the 127th power of 2). Sadly, this can have the<br/>effect of reducing the magic, by applying a facile explanation. One gets<br/>frustrated immediately, but you just don&apos;t know whether to call the writer on<br/>the bit of nonsense and risk a flame war, or to ignore the postings, much as a<br/>member of the opposition might deal with the current resident in the White<br/>House: this, too, shall pass. It&apos;s a hard choice because not getting it right<br/>seems to me to be disrespectful of if not irresponsible to the music that one<br/>loves. Moreover, this can be distracting to someone who is encountering such<br/>theory for the first time.</p><p>Recently, on this list, we&apos;ve had vivid examples of how deeply some musicians<br/>personalize a bit of theory or a definition. Upon encountering an alternative<br/>definition, they feel threatened, sometimes without realizing that their own<br/>definition is either exclusionary of others or so general as to be meaningless.<br/>Composers, especially, work in isolation and that breeds a kind of myopia<br/>(myauria?), but the very function of a community, like this list, is to open<br/>eyes and ears, not to close them.</p><p>As the old saying goes, &quot;a little knowledge is a dangerous thing&quot;.  An example:<br/>Within the tuning community there are many who know Partch&apos;s _Genesis_ by<br/>chapter, verse, and line.  For some of these literalists, this turns into a form<br/>of doctrinal knowledge where any form of deviation from Partch&apos;s practice is no<br/>longer to be considered &quot;just intonation&quot;.  That means, 1/1 must equal 392Hz,<br/>all harmonies must be derived from the diamond etc.. Clearly, if one actually<br/>_reads_ Partch, rather than memorizes him, one would come to other conclusions,<br/>realizing that Partch intended his &quot;monophony&quot; to be _an_ example, not _the_<br/>example of a functioning JI.  With the publication of the first edition of<br/>_Genesis_, Partch&apos;s work as a theorist largely ended.  It must be acknowledged<br/>that his theoretical work in _Genesis_ is often teasingly incomplete (for<br/>example, the derivation of the &quot;one-footed bride&quot;; to my knowledge, Paul Ehrlich<br/>is the only scholar who has examined this closely, taking Partch seriously as a<br/>theorist, yet for the very act of taking Partch seriously, he has been taken to<br/>task by the literalists), and that his subsequent compositional achievement goes<br/>far beyond the ideas presented in _Genesis_.  A failure to deal with these<br/>themes would, in effect, restrict the approach to Partch&apos;s music through 1972 to<br/>a theoretical project completed in 1947.</p><p>I envy someone like Kraig Grady who has the wonderful opportunity in his own web<br/>pages to invent an indigenous (if fictionally so) theory of music from whatever<br/>set of first principles he may choose or find.  But on the alternative tuning<br/>list, his role changes, to something like that of an ethnologist coming back<br/>from the field, with a responsibility to describe what he has heard or seen in a<br/>common language.  This may mean as little as running your postings through a<br/>spelling and grammar checker to get the English right (I cannot emphasize this<br/>enough to Americans: the smallest fault in spelling or grammar can render an<br/>entire text incomprehensible to someone who only reads English as a second<br/>language, and often for native speakers as well!).  But it also means that if<br/>one intends to innnovate within a theoretical tradition, that one has the<br/>responsibility to command the language of that tradition.</p><p>I&apos;ll be blunt on two matters of opinion: The first is that some gifted musicians<br/>are not theorists. This may be because they simply do not abstract their musical<br/>experience into words, or because their verbal skills are not up to it. This in<br/>no means diminishes my estimation of their musical skills, and in fact, there<br/>are many days when I wish, as a musician, that I were less reflective, less<br/>articulate about music.  The second is that music theory is a large structure<br/>into which one enters at the foundations.  However, theorists are busily working<br/>away at both the frontiers of the discipline and at foundations themselves.  For<br/>this reason, I have serious misgivings about the functioning of a list that<br/>tries to serve both total beginners and the more advanced.  I had thought of the<br/>FAQ as a place where the dialogue and results of past years on the list could be<br/>encapsultated, so that new list members can better follow the discussion rather<br/>a primer for absolute beginners in tuning theory.  I believe that there are<br/>other sources for beginners in tuning theory, but the theoretical achievements<br/>of the list are not readily accessible.  It is an understatement to say that the<br/>alternative tuning list has gone far beyond any other place of research in our<br/>field (compare the newest Grove or MGG), but these researches are largely<br/>inaccessible in over-dense archives. This desperately needs to be remedied.</p><p>I am an optimist, in that I believe one can have discourse about music that<br/>approaches music&apos;s magic with dignity. My mentor as an undergraduate was a<br/>classicist (N.O.Brown), who once delivered a Phi Beta Kappa address at Columbia<br/>entitled &quot;Apocalypse: The Place of Mystery in the Life of the Mind&quot;.  In it,<br/>Brown gives an example from the old Tibetan College of Magical Ritual. One of<br/>the courses taught at this institution was on &quot;Inner Heat&quot;.  As a final exam,<br/>the students in this course were required to sit naked on a frozen lake next to<br/>a pile of frozen shirts. As a measurement of their ability to generate &quot;inner<br/>heat&quot;, the students were required to wear and dry as many of these shirts as<br/>possible.  Okay, mystery, totally unexplicable. But totally demonstrable. Brown<br/>wrote: &quot;Where the power is real, the test is real, and the grading system<br/>dumbfoundingly objective. I say no more...&quot;</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2001 8:24:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I envy someone like Kraig Grady who has the wonderful opportunity in<br/>&gt; his own web<br/>&gt; pages to invent an indigenous (if fictionally so) theory of music from<br/>&gt; whatever<br/>&gt; set of first principles he may choose or find.
