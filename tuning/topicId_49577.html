On a keyboard, do different musical<br/>keys have particular affects because of the levers used to play their triad?<br/>Or, does the pitch of a key represent some recognizable , historical tonal area<br/>and those with pitch recognition assign historical baggage to a key because<br/>they recognize the pitch?<br/>     Say, what would happen if a piano was tuned in equal temperament, but<br/>1/2 step flat?  Would that mean as I played all the white keys, my friend who<br/>recognizes keys would think I was playing in C a step flat, or would they hear<br/>it as simply in B?  I have done this, and what happens, every time, is that the<br/>listener recognizes the key of B, even though I am not touching a single<br/>black key!  One pianist told me that F# was a very dark key, even in ET.  So I am<br/>sitting there playing in G and she is saying, &quot;There, can&apos;t you hear how<br/>darker that is than 1/2 step higher in G?&quot; So I modulate up to Ab and she is<br/>adamant how much clearer that is that the &quot;F#.&quot;  I am not seeing any key recognition<br/>here, other than by pitch.<br/>     Assigning &apos;key character&apos; to the various keys is, IMHO, leftover<br/>baggage.  In ET, there are 88 levers, all equidistant apart.  It doesn&apos;t matter where<br/>you select your combination, the relationships between the notes do not<br/>change.<br/>  Now, when I have tuned a well temperament down 1/2 step, the results get<br/>confusing.  The temperament-savvy pianists instantly recognize  that both the<br/>clarity of C and the biting edge of B or E are not there, and other keys are<br/>similarly alien, save for Eb and A, which are quite similar in WT to their ET<br/>sound.  They couldn&apos;t stand having not only the pitch wrong for a given key, but<br/>also, the radically different-than-expected tonal quality of the keys.  These<br/>key characteristics are working tools for the WT pianists.  Misplacing them is<br/>obvious to those musicians that use them.<br/>    Some of the non-temperament aware players didn&apos;t notice anything at all,<br/>but some of them did mention that the piano seemed a little out of tune, but<br/>they couldn&apos;t exactly define why.  (clean octaves and unisons are all that most<br/>pianists are sensitive about, which I blame on ET&apos;s deadening effect on true<br/>tonal awareness).<br/>    The assigned characteristics that go with ET&apos;s various keys are real for<br/>those that &apos;in the zone.&apos;  If one hears the key of F# as darker or edgier than<br/>F, then the music will carry that effect for that listener when it moves to<br/>F#,  even if all the thirds are the same size.  Even Enid Katahn, who played on<br/>our two CD&apos;s, and is as temperament aware as any pianist I have seen, says<br/>that when she is using an ET piano in concert, she still &quot;fakes it&quot; and tries to<br/>create the same sense of contrast with her playing.<br/>    However,  the affective effects (which have been well documented) various<br/>consonance/dissonance in musical intervals is missing in ET and no amount of<br/>interpretation will completely make up for the lack. The sameness has its<br/>value for compositions written from and ET perspective, but its use destroys a<br/>delicate but powerfully affective quality of the music that was written to take<br/>advantage of the differences in a well-temperament.  To some, this is no loss,<br/>to others, it is a profound one.<br/>     There is something undeniably engaging in an extremely tempered<br/>interval, and something very soothing about a Just one.  These musical qualities and<br/>the resulting emotional manipulations that come from their use by the great<br/>composers add a dimension to the music that can&apos;t be had any other way.  It<br/>follows that I don&apos;t think anyone can fully appreciate the keyboard genius of<br/>Beethoven or Haydn without understanding the qualities of a well-temperament.<br/>   Hmm,  that ain&apos;t exactly what I came here to talk about, but it&apos;ll have to<br/>be close enough for today.<br/>Regards,</p><p>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html">http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a>&quot;&gt;<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>: Six Degrees of Tonality&lt;/A&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=49583 href="#49583">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2003 10:10:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    This calls for an interesting test.
