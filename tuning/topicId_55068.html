It turns out that in 3D, the magnitude<br/>of a/\b/\c is the volume of the parallelopiped<br/>spanned by a, b and c. which will give us the number<br/>of notes in the periodicity block.<br/>When you wedge two vectors you get a bivector<br/>which is a directed area - the parallelogram<br/>area swept out from one to the next. When you<br/>wedge three of them you get a trivector or<br/>a directed volume.</p><p>To try this out, write out the unison vectors<br/>using unit vectors for the directions of travel<br/>of interest</p><p>So for instance:<br/>Syntonic comma [* 4, -1&gt; = 4u1 - u2<br/>Diesis [* 0, -3&gt; = -3u2<br/>Septimal diesis [* 2, 0 1&gt; = 2u1 + u3<br/>(4u1 - u2)/\(-3u2)/\(2u1 + u3)<br/>Now any vector wedged with itself is 0, so<br/>you can ignore terms like u1/\u1 so multiplying out you get:<br/>= (-12u1u2) (2u1 + u3)<br/>Here I&apos;ve written u1u2 for u1/\u2 to make it easier to read<br/>= -12u1u2u3. So any scale built up using 3/2s, 5/4s<br/>and 7/4s and with no pairs of notes in it at any<br/>of these intervals will have twelve notes in it.<br/>So septimal scales have 12 notes just like the<br/>five limit ones.</p><p>Now Let&apos;s try out a more complex case, with the<br/>lattice generated by 3/2, 5/4 and 13/8.<br/>Using *s for the ignored prime factors, lets<br/>uses these as our unison vectors:</p><p>tridecimal diesis 26/25 = [* 0, -2 * *, 1&gt; = (-2u2 + u3)<br/>syntonic comma 81/80 = [* 4, -1 * *, 0&gt; = (4u1 - u2)<br/>schisma [* 8, 1&gt; = (8u1 + u2)<br/>(8u1 + u2)/\(4u1 - u2)/\(-2u2 + u3)<br/>=(-8u1u2 + 4u2u1)/\(-2u2 + u3)<br/>= -8u1u2u3<br/>So the periodicity block has 8 notes. To make it<br/>just try and construct an 8 note scale with none<br/>of those dieses or commas, here is an example:<br/>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 13/8 16/9 2/1<br/>There are many ways to do it, anyway<br/>the use of the calculation is just that it shows<br/>that any such scale has 8 notes so when you<br/>get that far you are done.</p><p>For another ex:<br/>Syntonic comma 81/80 = [* 4, -1 0&gt; = -4u1 - u2<br/>Septimal diesis 64/63 = [* 4, -1 0&gt; = 4u1 - u2<br/>tritonic diesis 50/49 = [* 0, 2 -2&gt; = 2u2 - 2u3<br/>(-4u1 - u2)/\(4u1 - u2)/\(2u2 - 2u3)<br/>= (-4u1u2 -4u2u1)/\(2u2 - 2u3)<br/>= 8u1u2u3  - 8u2u1u3<br/>where I&apos;m writing u1u2 for u1/\u2 etc. to make it easier to read<br/>Now, since the bivector u1u2 is a unit of directed area,<br/>if you reverse the order you change the direction so change<br/>sign, so u1u2 = -u2u1. So u2u1u3 = -u1u2u3<br/>So the answer is 8u1u2u3 + 8u1u2u3<br/>= 16 u1u2u3<br/>So this time all the scales have 16 notes.</p><p>I was surprised to find in my calculations that<br/>nearly all the 3D periodicity blocks I made using<br/>the 3, 5 and 7 , 11 or 13 limit dieses<br/>and commas came out as 12 note scales.<br/>I had to search for a while to find interesting<br/>examples with other numbers of notes for<br/>the calculations.</p><p>For instance if you use the syntonic comma<br/>and the schisma instead of the syntonic comma<br/>and the diesis as your unison vectors<br/>you still get a twelve tone scale.<br/>If you use the pythagorean comma and the<br/>diesis though you get a 36 note scale<br/>which makes sense as the pythagorean<br/>comma and diesis are indpenedent<br/>- one is 3 notes in the 5/4 direction<br/>and the other is 12 notes in the 3/2<br/>direction so you wuold expect the answer<br/>to be 36 indeed.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2004 8:44:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

I was surprised to find in my calculations that<br/>&gt; nearly all the 3D periodicity blocks I made using<br/>&gt; the 3, 5 and 7 , 11 or 13 limit dieses<br/>&gt; and commas came out as 12 note scales.<br/>&gt; I had to search for a while to find interesting<br/>&gt; examples with other numbers of notes for<br/>&gt; the calculations.</p><p>you could have gotten some 5-limit examples<br/>right off of my bingo-card lattices:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/bingo.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/bingo.htm</a></p><p>&gt; For instance if you use the syntonic comma<br/>&gt; and the schisma instead of the syntonic comma<br/>&gt; and the diesis as your unison vectors<br/>&gt; you still get a twelve tone scale.<br/>&gt; If you use the pythagorean comma and the<br/>&gt; diesis though you get a 36 note scale<br/>&gt; which makes sense as the pythagorean<br/>&gt; comma and diesis are indpenedent<br/>&gt; - one is 3 notes in the 5/4 direction<br/>&gt; and the other is 12 notes in the 3/2<br/>&gt; direction so you wuold expect the answer<br/>&gt; to be 36 indeed.</p><p>here, you&apos;ve disclosed a tuning which has<br/>&quot;torsion&quot;.</p><p>the 2,3,5-monzos for the pythagorean-comma<br/>and diesis are:</p><p>[-19 12,  0 &gt;

Another example could be the sum of<br/>&gt; the exponents of 2 and 3 - because<br/>&gt; if you multiply together two<br/>&gt; ratios you add the exponents.<br/>&gt; so multiplication of ratios corresponds<br/>&gt;

to 36edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh right I see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if the 2/1 is 36 degrees, and the 3/1<br/>&gt; is 57 degrees and 5/1 is 84 then<br/>&gt; the 33 I got there is just the<br/>&gt; number of degrees for 15/8 in the scale.<br/>&gt; Divide by 3 and you get the 12-et<br/>&gt; position which is 1 as expected.</p><p>looks like you made a typo there ... of course<br/>the 15/8 ratio maps to 11 degrees of 12edo, not 1.</p><p>&gt; I.e. if you map 3/1 to 57 degrees of<br/>&gt; 36-et and 5/1 to 84 degrees and then<br/>&gt; stack those intervals consistently<br/>&gt; then you will get to degree 33<br/>&gt; as the interval for 15/8.<br/>&gt; The val then tells you how to<br/>&gt; do that mapping.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Trying with a few other ratios<br/>&gt; e.g. where is 5/4 in a twelve tone scale:<br/>&gt; &lt;12 19 28] [-2 0, 1&gt;<br/>&gt; = -24 + 28 = 4<br/>&gt; so 5/4 is the fourth degree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or 16/15<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;12 19 28] [4 -1, -1&gt;<br/>&gt; = 48 - 19 - 28 = 1<br/>&gt; :-).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, 25/16 which we know is G#<br/>&gt; &lt;12, 19 28] [-4 0, 2&gt;<br/>&gt; = -48 + 56 = 8<br/>&gt; and indeed G# is the 8th degree<br/>&gt; C C# D D# E F F# G G#<br/>&gt; 0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7 8</p><p>yes, that&apos;s all correct, as you could see.</p><p>&gt; So, I&apos;m convinced - but how does<br/>&gt; it work?</p><p>ah ... i think that&apos;s the $64000 question.</p><p>i haven&apos;t asked him about it, but my guess<br/>is that Gene saw that this stuff worked out<br/>algebraically, and *now* he and the rest of<br/>us are all trying to figure out *why*.</p><p>... or more likely, Gene already understands<br/>all of it and the rest of us don&apos;t.</p><p>anyway, i think now you can see why vals and<br/>wedgies are useful.  the purpose of temperament<br/>is to emulate JI in some way, but trading off<br/>accuracy of intonation for lower cardinality,<br/>more harmonic senses, etc.</p><p>the vals and wedgies show us how the temperaments<br/>and JI intersect, and they also provide compact<br/>sets of numbers that uniquely identify temperaments<br/>and even whole temperament families, and help us<br/>to see the relationships between different tunings.</p><p>&gt; Surely it also applies to the original<br/>&gt; pitches as well as the et approximation<br/>&gt; - if you actually have<br/>&gt; a 15/8 in your scale and arrange<br/>&gt; the 16 notes in ascending order,<br/>&gt; and you have your periodicity<br/>&gt; block as a rectangle rather than<br/>&gt; some irregular shape,<br/>&gt; presumably this shows that<br/>&gt; the 15/8 is the 33rd note inthe<br/>&gt; scale, so the val applied<br/>&gt; to the original periodicity block pitches<br/>&gt; again gives their scale degrees<br/>&gt; which is quite impressive given<br/>&gt; that it is a 2D region in the lattice<br/>&gt; and you wouldn&apos;t easily be able<br/>&gt; to see what the scale degrees are.</p><p>yes, absolutely.  the first periodicity-block<br/>theory was formulated by Fokker, and it was<br/>all in connection with JI ... even tho he too<br/>mapped 7-limit JI to 31-ET, he explained everything<br/>in terms of JI.</p><p>the area of any 2-D segment of the lattice<br/>(usually a paralellogram) encloses all of<br/>the ratios formed by any two prime-factors<br/>within the boundaries defined by the unison-vectors.<br/>i think you grasp that.</p><p>&gt; You wouldn&apos;t expect that to work if<br/>&gt; your block was irregular in shape<br/>&gt; of course - if you replaced e.g.<br/>&gt; 5/4 by a 5/4 moved up by a dozen<br/>&gt; diesis shifts or whatever it will<br/>&gt; surely put the notes of the scale<br/>&gt; out of order, so it is something<br/>&gt; to do with the original<br/>&gt; periodicity block representations<br/>&gt; of the equivalence classes<br/>&gt; under the unison vectors.</p><p>transposing any JI ratio by one instance<br/>of a unison-vector will change the shape<br/>of the periodicity-block, but only slightly,<br/>and may be desirable if one wants to have,<br/>for example, a 5-limit hexagon rather than<br/>a 5-limit parallelogram.</p><p>but i think it&apos;s not likely that one would<br/>transpose a note by more one instance of a<br/>unison-vector.  so what you say is true,<br/>but i don&apos;t think it&apos;s very meaningful.</p><p>anyway ... there&apos;s the business about the<br/>TM-reduced lattice basis, which puts all the<br/>JI pitches as compactly as possible near 1/1.</p><p>(BTW, the lattices on my webpage about this<br/>are wrong, and should only be showing the<br/>unison-vectors and not all the other pitches too.<br/>i&apos;ll have to redo them when i have time.)</p><p>&gt; &lt;big snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s all making sense now.<br/>&gt; Not what I&apos;d call a proof<br/>&gt; but can see how one could<br/>&gt; prove this, at least, seems<br/>&gt; reasonably feasible that one<br/>&gt; could do it - the big gap<br/>&gt; is to show that if you have a comma<br/>&gt; defining a periodicity block then<br/>&gt; the comma is smaller than<br/>&gt; the smallest step in the<br/>&gt; resulting scale, so that when<br/>&gt;

So it is an<br/>area with a sense of direction and x /\y = - y/\x.<br/>A vector is made up of unit vectors for two or more<br/>directions of travel - similarly a wedge product<br/>of vectors is made up of wedge products of unit vectors.</p><p>One example of its use in tuning theory is to find out the<br/>area or volume of a periodicity block. To do that you<br/>write out the monzos in the form of a sum of unit vectors<br/>then multiply them out using two rules: ei/\ei = 0 (area 0)<br/>and because it is a directed area, ei/\ej = - ej/\ei<br/>You can only change the order of the unit vectors using the<br/>second rule.</p><p>Example:<br/>tridecimal diesis 26/25 = [* 0, -2 * *, 1&gt; = (-2e2 + e3)<br/>syntonic comma 81/80 = [* 4, -1 * *, 0&gt; = (4e1 - e2)<br/>schisma [* 8, 1&gt; = (8e1 + e2)<br/>(-2e2 + e3) /\ (4e1 - e2) /\ (8e1 + e2)<br/>= (-2e2 + e3) /\ (4e12 -8e21)<br/>= (-2e2 + e3) /\ (-12e21)<br/>= -12 e321<br/>An example would be David Canright&apos;s<br/>13 limit twelve tone scale.<br/>You can simplify this calculation<br/>by using the diesis in place of the schisma.</p><p>Well the best I can do at present. Don&apos;t know how many<br/>hours it took me :-).</p><p>Be sure to say if anything there is unclearly<br/>expressed or of course if there is a<br/>typo or something not correct.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2004 6:00:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Klaus:</p><p>&gt; but what the heck does it mean (in a different post) that<br/>&gt; something is &quot;onto&quot;?
