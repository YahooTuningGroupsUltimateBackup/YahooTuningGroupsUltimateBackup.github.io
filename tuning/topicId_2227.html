Perhaps I&apos;ll have to look into the sales<br/>tax side though, as you mentioned.  Hmmm...</p><p>   Maybe it would have been better, rather than suggesting that listers buy the CD<br/>from the person who is geographically closest, to instead have them buy from the<br/>one who is geographically closest but not in the same state, so that state sales<br/>tax won&apos;t apply.  Hmmm...</p></div>
