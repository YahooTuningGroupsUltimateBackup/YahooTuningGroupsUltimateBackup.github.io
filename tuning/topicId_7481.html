Although the tones in the diagonal row of 1/1, 5/5, 3/3, 7/7,<br/>9/9, 11/11 share the same frequency, Partch uses them as different tones<br/>_functionally_.</p><p>This is not facetious or clever: the distinct functional identities of these<br/>tones were important enough to Partch that he used a lot of extra hardwood to<br/>carve redundant tones in the middle row of the diamond marimba!  (One does<br/>wonder, however, what alternative designs he might have considered had he<br/>known about Erv Wilson&apos;s diamond graphs.)</p></div>
