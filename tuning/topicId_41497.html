That&apos;s not what the music is about at all.  It&apos;s<br/>just a way to get into a kind of psychedelic realm that, ultimately,<br/>is very whimsical.</p><p>It&apos;s music that really doesn&apos;t take itself all that seriously and, in<br/>fact, Ferneyhough says he&apos;s not necessarily going for &quot;precision&quot; in<br/>the interpretation, but &quot;fidelity&quot;... meaning, it seems, more the<br/>*attitude...*</p><p>So the people who just look at the notes and see all the complexity<br/>and over seriousness don&apos;t have the right take on this cat.</p><p>He has a jolly look, with beard and long hair, just like Santa Claus,<br/>which is entirely appropriate for this season.</p><p>(More on Metatuning later...)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=41498 href="#41498">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E; &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2002 10:08:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>I&apos;m glad you enjoyed the Ferneyhough concert, microtones and all.

Well, I do admit it<br/>seems you Californians have had a greater dose of Ferneyhough than<br/>those of us out this way.  That&apos;s a little curious, too, since he<br/>seems far from a typical &quot;West Coast&quot; composer... maybe that<br/>contributes to the friction.</p><p>I guess Kyle even said he admired some of his pieces, but I do also<br/>agree that I can hardly remember anything right now (it&apos;s<br/>the &quot;morning after&quot;) except for a lot of high string glissandos... :)</p><p>Anyway, yeah, it&apos;s a &quot;hot&quot; group, from the organization and<br/>performance standpoint... pretty young guys, too.  I don&apos;t know how<br/>they&apos;ve managed it...</p><p>[P.S. The comments on the Ferneyhough &quot;take&quot; were really not at all<br/>directed at you; I&apos;ve heard *lot* of comments of late about all<br/>this &quot;complexity stuff...&quot;]</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3><a id=41505 href="#41505">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E; &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2002 8:03:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Thanks for your contribution to this thread...

That he seems somewhat out of place is simply *where* he landed: UCSD&apos;s specialized music department frequently seems nothing more than &quot;Darmstadt Lite&quot; - a far cry from it&apos;s early days with Pauline Oliveros, Will Ogden, and Robert Erickson.
