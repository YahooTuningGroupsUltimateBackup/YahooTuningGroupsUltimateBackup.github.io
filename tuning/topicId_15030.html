Guitar Player Magazine started to die<br/>the slow death of dissipating sales... Joe Gore and the other<br/>experimental-friendly editorial crew members eventually got the boot<br/>or bailed while the bailing was good... and the dawn of bold<br/>avant-garde guitar with a pronounced microtonal &quot;agenda&quot; wasn&apos;t just<br/>around the corner after all.</p><p>But it all happened. I was there, and I remember...</p><p>--d.stearns</p></div>
