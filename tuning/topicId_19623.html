Interesting stuff, including SEVERAL<br/>recordings of music and piano performance by Easley Blackwood.</p><p>I was particularly impressed that Blackwood was PERFORMING difficult<br/>modern works on piano, including Ives CONCORD SONATA and Copland&apos;s<br/>PIANO SONATA...</p><p>Having gone somewhat through Blackwood&apos;s &quot;Structure of Recognizable<br/>Diatonic Tunings&quot; (Still looking for my own copy!!) I was naturally<br/>impressed with his mathematical and theoretical skills.</p><p>This rather belies the notion that one cannot be a skilled,<br/>mathematically/scientifically inclined theoretician and a fine<br/>performer and composer as well....</p><p>Some people just have it all...</p><p>Here is the Cedille Records website.  You can order right on line.  I<br/>plan to myself...</p><p><a href="http://www.cedillerecords.org/">http://www.cedillerecords.org/</a></p><p>___________ _______ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>3/1/2001 9:17:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; This rather belies the notion that one cannot be a skilled,<br/>&gt; mathematically/scientifically inclined theoretician and a fine<br/>&gt; performer and composer as well....</p><p>A.
