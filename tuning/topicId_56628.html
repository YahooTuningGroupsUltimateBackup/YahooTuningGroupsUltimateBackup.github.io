The fact that there is some kind of development that makes sense within a particular culture and does not outside that context is important to ponder upon. I always found cultural imposition distasteful especially since I&apos;m situated in a country whose past is besmeared with senseless &grave;reforms&grave;. A great deal of our heritage has been lost thanks to such ignorant manipulations. It is fortunate that I was quick enough to realize the value of tradition. Art should not be made a subject of politics, but rather, politics a subject of art.</p><p>Which reminds me, are you aware of the musical dichotomy in Turkey where they have begun using Western electro-acoustic and stage-percussion instruments next to the shunned and revised historical instruments for popular effect? The results of 12-ET jumbled with snare drums employed without regard for either aesthetics or moral values is unsettling to say the least (not that I&apos;m against any temperament, mind you)... That is perhaps why I choose to stay indoors.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Kraig Grady<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 12 Ocak 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 18:02<br/>  Subject: [tuning] MUSIC BASED ON TOMBAK SPECTRUM/ Wilson neutral third scale</p><p>  Hi Ozan!<br/>      Obviously neither of us buy the idea of technically underdeveloped<br/>  recognizing that there are all types of &apos;technologies&apos; which the west<br/>  overlooks in the haste of its own pet projects. look at gong making.
