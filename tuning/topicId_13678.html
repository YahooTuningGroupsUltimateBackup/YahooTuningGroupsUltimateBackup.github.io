Easley<br/>Blackwood, I know him. I met him in Chicago.&quot; So we had a very pleasant<br/>conversation about how nice American people are and how clever they are.<br/>I told him that if the Americans I know had their way his library would<br/>be filled with tuning theory books, strange scores and even stranger<br/>CDs. Anyway as he controls the purse strings I am going to request that<br/>he spends some tax-payers&apos; money on JI/Microtonal music.</p><p>I would be extremely grateful if any of you can take the time to post<br/>your top ten (or thereabouts) CDs and top ten books and/or scores with<br/>references if possible.  I could then draw up a shortlist and charm him<br/>into &apos;branching out&apos; a little. I think Blackwood&apos;s own studies would be<br/>appropriate. Does anyone have the details? Also, Neil Haverstick might<br/>care to suggest one of his own excellent recordings.</p><p>Thank you in advance for any efforts you might make to assist me.</p></div><h3><a id=13681 href="#13681">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2000 11:30:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13678">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13678</a></p><p>&gt; Today I renewed my copy of Easley Blackwood&apos;s &quot;The Structure of<br/>&gt; Recognizable Diatonic Tunings&quot;  for about the twenty second time.</p><p>Wow... and that&apos;s all it took?

You might<br/>have covered this one but &apos;Early Music&apos; by the Kronos Quartet has some<br/>Guillaume de Machaut and Harry Partch items which are of tuning<br/>interest. At a guess I would say that the Machaut Kyrie uses Pythagorean<br/>ratios and the Two Studies on Greek Scales (arr. Ben Johnston) indeed<br/>use the properly tuned Greek scales. Further analysis awaits. The CD is<br/>on Nonesuch Records 1997.</p></div>
