And<br/>even though I long ago realized that (annoying) typos seem to be an<br/>unavoidable byproduct of continually firing off a steady stream of<br/>email (and even noticed that I now tend to read right through those of<br/>others), I&apos;d still like to re-post this bit as it was important to me,<br/>and as such I&apos;d like it to be out there the way I thought it, or<br/>wished to say it... Thanks for your patience (or indulgence as the<br/>case may be).</p><p>English writer and nature lover W. H. Hudson wrote &quot;for here the<br/>religion that languishes in crowded cities or steals shame-faced to<br/>hide itself in dim churches, flourishes greatly, filling the soul with<br/>a solemn joy. Face to face with Nature on the vast hills at eventide,<br/>who does not feel himself near to the Unseen?&quot; I think that the Ives<br/>who gave voice to _The Housatonic at Stockbridge_, to _Thoreau_ and<br/>_Emerson_, to _Grantchester_ and the great sobering close of _Autumn_,<br/>intuitively knew that music could also &apos;languish in crowded cities,&apos;<br/>or &apos;steal shame-faced to hide itself in dim churches,&apos; and he was<br/>often able to bypass that... to take music &apos;face to face with Nature<br/>on the vast hills at eventide,&apos; and &apos;near to the<br/>Unseen.&apos; And while Ives is often cited for his bold and anticipatory<br/>(structural) innovations, it is this (largely ineffable)<br/>accomplishment of Ives that I personally find to be the most<br/>remarkable and inspiring achievement of his music.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
