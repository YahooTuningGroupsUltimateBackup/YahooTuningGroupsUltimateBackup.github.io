Because I love tritone relation (half octave) and it&apos;s like &quot;burned&quot; into my creative process, right now, two minutes after inventing this scale, I have realized there&apos;s another interesting hidden feature: six lower notes are combined from chords A major and Eb major, six upper notes are combined from  F minor and B minor chords. A major and B minor triads are mirrored one to the other as well as Eb major second inversion (kvartsextakord) to F minor first inversion (sextakord).

There&apos;s no mathematics in it. I just use in the upper octave all notes which I didn&apos;t use in lower octave. So with C Dorian in lower octave it&apos;s not possible to use C# Lydian or C# Major in upper octave, because in such case there will be 7+7=14 notes (not 12), some notes will be used two times (Eb F G Bb C when upper scale will be C# Lydian, Eb F Bb C when C# Major), some will be missing (E F# B in the first case, E B in the second one). Besides the last note B# of both C# scales in upper octave will be identical with the first note of the next period, which I don&apos;t want (there&apos;s always &quot;bridge&quot; interval in all my scales).</p><p>So it&apos;s obvious: when there&apos;s C Dorian in lower octave (C D Eb F G A Bb), notes missing to chromatics are C# E F# G# B, which is C# minor pentatonics and I use it in the upper octave.</p><p>Daniel</p></div><h3><a id=82874 href="#82874">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2009 7:55:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--So why do you again return to your original scale? -Daniel<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I misunderstood you and thought you were posting about the original scale.&nbsp; But, yes, you were right about those statements about the second scale, which is basically just the same 5-note chord repeated over 2 octaves (it was merely a typo that explains the missing F: it was supposed to be there).</p><p>--&quot;Don&apos;t you see clearly written: &quot;non symmetrical scales&quot;? -Daniel<br/>&nbsp; Yes, but I thought you had switched topics back later on in the e-mail: since I could not explain how you could have &quot;magically&quot; arrived at the notes you got otherwise.</p><p>--&quot;And I didn&apos;t say that symmetrical means automatically &quot;good<br/>--sounding&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understood that part...I never said symmetrical automatically means good sounding either.&nbsp; As you noted, the harmonic series, for example, is not &quot;symmetric&quot;.&nbsp; What I&apos;m trying to get at is ways to make good-sounding scales that can be played as chords...be they symmetric or not (and if you can see/find any patterns, symmetrical or asymmetrical, I&apos;d be interested to know what they are).</p><p>--&quot;I just use in the upper octave all notes which<br/>--I didn&apos;t use in lower octave. &quot; -Daniel<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, ok, that makes it much more obvious for how you handle the asymmetrical scales: you make a chord in the lower octave and then simply take the inverse of those notes (IE the missing notes) to get the higher octave...and whatever is in-between becomes the &quot;axis gap&quot; (if I have it right this time around).&nbsp; This also explains that &quot;magic&quot; calculation of your scale that confused me before...and also why you (had to) use c# minor and not another scale.</p><p>-Michael<br/>___._</p></div>
