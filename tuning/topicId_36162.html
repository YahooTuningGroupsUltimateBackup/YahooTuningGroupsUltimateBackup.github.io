It was List bot<br/>- they had many lists that they hosted and<br/>when it closed, members had teh choice to move<br/>to a new paid service, or to lose their archives.<br/>I was one of those who had a list that<br/>was affected - the mailing lists for FTS<br/>and for those who want to hear about my<br/>VRML trees prog. when it is released (...).<br/>They didn&apos;t have any posts of any significance<br/>in them though; they were newsletter type ones<br/>and just two or three posts in the FTS one<br/>and nothing at all in the VT one.</p><p>I suppose if a list has a copyright policy<br/>that gives others the rights to reproduce<br/>posts and members see that when they join<br/>then legally one is okay to reproduce them<br/>in whatever method is covered by the policy<br/>- but out of courtesy one might still ask<br/>permission.</p><p>In my case I&apos;d still make<br/>the archive opt in in that situation<br/>unless it was clear that everyone unanimously<br/>felt it was okay for their posts to be<br/>included.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
