I&apos;d recommend regular jumbo guitar<br/>fretwire -- jumbo will easier to file down when you start to see significant<br/>fret wear.</p><p>&gt;&gt; How about the upper octave,<br/>&gt;&gt; will the frets be impossibly close together? Has anyone<br/>&gt;&gt; done an &quot;every-other-fret&quot;, or switched temperments for<br/>&gt;&gt; the upper octave?</p><p>&gt;Sounds like an interesting concept, but as a guitar player<br/>&gt;I&apos;d find it a bit strange to split the fretboard<br/>&gt;into two seperate terrain. I&apos;d be playing up<br/>&gt;the neck and then my notes would be different?</p><p>David -- are you telling me the top octave of the Catler fretboard is the<br/>same as the bottom octave? Sure doesn&apos;t look that way from the picture!</p></div>
