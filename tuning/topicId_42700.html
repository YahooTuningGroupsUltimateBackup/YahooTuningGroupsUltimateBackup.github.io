I love composing this way.

I think it&apos;s only<br/>&gt; relevant in that the tuning isn&apos;t the same old same old, and while<br/>&gt; it&apos;s obvious enough that more is not necessarily more interesting,<br/>&gt; more interesting is more interesting (especially in the hands of a<br/>&gt; talented composer such as yourself).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hmmmmmmmmm. . . not exactly sure what you mean here. .</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;To my mind music is more allegory than psychoacoustic construct.

Fire in Heaven would be an example<br/>of flat music where the tuning and certain specific aspects of it are<br/>fundamentally at the core of piece&apos;s conception (though I personally<br/>thought this piece was largely unsatisfying due to its flatness too).<br/>Sand didn&apos;t seem to me to be a piece where the specific tuning used<br/>was inseparable from the piece that was utilizing it. It was,<br/>however, interesting precisely because it wasn&apos;t the standard tuning<br/>and because it was microtonality in the hands of a talented composer.</p><p>As I said before, this is pretty much the antithesis of what the<br/>online microtonal community represents--it represents a technocracy<br/>largely devoid of artistic and musical input.</p><p>I believe that music is more allegory than psychoacoustic construct.<br/>It&apos;s a great enigmatic, and great enigmatic&apos;s symbolism will always<br/>invite detection and avert definition.</p><p>Not that that would ever stop anybody from trying, but if allegories<br/>are based on parallels between two levels of meaning, the one that&apos;s<br/>assumed and the one that&apos;s literally presented, then it would seem<br/>that microtonalists&apos; pathological obsession with the literal minutia<br/>of this or that tuning condition undermines so much of what music is<br/>really all about... its magic, its liveliness, its soul!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I appreciate your detailed comments---here are some replies:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;But to my way of working and dealing with it, oblique and densely<br/>&gt; &gt;static information like that in the Pollock example you cite, is<br/>&gt; &gt;routinely parsed into attainable gestures; melodies and rhythms, a<br/>&gt; &gt;veritable musical DNA if you will.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This kind of abstraction seems to me to be the easy part.
