There are many other<br/>&gt; kinds of temperament besides ETs. But in this case, you&apos;re right. With<br/>&gt; only 5 notes and such a tight (and I&apos;d say unrealistic for a<br/>&gt; wood-framed stringed instrument) error tolerance, I don&apos;t know of any<br/>&gt; microtemperament that can introduce any new JI intervals into the same<br/>&gt; 5 notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s all I&apos;m trying to say, Dave. But always the curious one, I fully intend in the future to<br/>&gt; look at microtempering, it just all takes time.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about unrealistic error tolerance.
