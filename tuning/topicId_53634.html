Equal-beating (or what might perhaps be more generally<br/>called coordinate-beating or beat-savvy) scales are probably easier to<br/>listen to than those with arbitrary undesigned patterns of beating.</p><p>And then I&apos;d venture the following opinion:  which way you want to go<br/>depends on whether you want simply relaxation or more complete integration<br/>with life as it actually is, which is also healing but not necessarily<br/>relaxing.  For a total vacation, go with slow beating.  To remain fully<br/>functional, energized, and ready to meet the world as it is consider<br/>including something other than pure or near just.  I&apos;m partly kidding but<br/>want to put it this way just to tickle people&apos;s responses, because I think<br/>there is some truth to this, but don&apos;t know the limits of it.</p><p>For the very-slow-beating category this comes about pretty naturally by<br/>aiming for just and missing a little, such as if you have a real acoustic<br/>instrument that you are tuning, or else a synth with limited tuning<br/>accuracy.</p><p>Pure just does not occur in nature, and nature is pretty relaxing.  The<br/>closest to pure just I have heard in nature is very large machinery with<br/>primarily a single fundamental and *lots* of harmonics (hmm, I guess that&apos;s<br/>not nature), but even there there is apparently something like bearing drift<br/>or other effects that keep the sound from being static.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=53838 href="#53838">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2004 6:26:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Bill Canty &lt;bill@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Midi pitch bends are capable of all the accuracy anyone is likely to<br/>&gt; &gt; need;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you mean the normal 0 to 127 pitch bend messages, or the 14-bit ones?</p><p>Fine bend is 14 bits, with the usual range setting you get 12*2^12 =<br/>49152 divisions of the octave.

In practice on<br/>*my* pipe organ phase-locking *between* pipes has not been something I&apos;ve<br/>been able to achieve.</p><p>Supposedly it is factor in design that nearby pipes will pitch-shift to be<br/>closer to each other, and thus pipes in a chest are often arranged in 4 rows<br/>so that adjacent pipes on a row are consecutive thirds, so that the thirds<br/>will tune closer to pure.  Thus a slight amount of adaptive JI happening in<br/>a pipe organ.  Not that I can say I&apos;ve ever heard the effect of this,<br/>because no A/B comparison has been possible and clearly the result is not by<br/>any means just thirds even though it may help the thirds to be *better*.</p><p>Anyway on my organ when I get the pitches close enough, I don&apos;t get phase<br/>locking, but only near-phase locking with drift.  When there is some<br/>coupling this usually *sounds* like it will drift slowly, then slip, then<br/>drift quickly in the out-of-phase zone until it gets back to near in-phase<br/>and then drift slowly again.  Sort of like trying to pump a bicycle with<br/>only one pedal, if you get what I mean.</p><p>&gt; Essentially, if there is any beating left here, it becomes so slow<br/>&gt; (because of the coupling) that it becomes silly to refer to it as<br/>&gt; beating rather than as the amplitude envelope of the sound.</p><p>I still call it beating even if it is once per minute.  With a lot of<br/>harmonics involved, the individual harmonics are beating separately (though<br/>of course not quite &quot;independently&quot;) and this sounds is often I think<br/>referred to as &quot;rolling&quot;.  But it is not anything like an overall amplitude<br/>envelope because there is a separate envelope for each harmonic.  So you<br/>hear a constant shifting in weight among the harmonics, the &quot;rolling&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Pure just does not occur in nature,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Depends what you mean.</p><p>Right, I was quite vague there.  I was thinking first that a single sound<br/>source (i.e. one note with its harmonics) does not count as just because it<br/>is &quot;just&quot; one note.  Of course a harmonic sound source could be called just<br/>whereas an inharmonic one is not, but that&apos;s not what I mean.  So I was<br/>trying to think of examples in &quot;nature&quot; in which more than one sound source<br/>occur together and tune justly to each other.  I could not think of any, so<br/>the next closest thing is a sound source that is so harmonically rich that<br/>you would not say it was a single note.  Big fans are like that for me.  In<br/>fact multiple modes of vibration are probably coexisting there and the<br/>resulting slight beating is perhaps part of what accounts for the perception<br/>of multiple notes.</p><p>But also a static sound can create that perception becuase of slight head<br/>movements and because of wand&apos;rings of the acoustic attention.  You know the<br/>phenomenon wherein you listen to a harmonically rich static sound source,<br/>and *think* a tune and this causes the tune you think to appear to manifest<br/>as *real* ?  Other people besides me have confirmed this phenomenon.  It is<br/>very interesting because it is in a sense the lowest energy way to play an<br/>instrument.  (Unfortuately no one else can hear it but you.)</p><p>&gt; When played normally, all *bowed* strings,<br/>&gt; reed and brass instruments, and the human voice have *exactly*<br/>&gt; harmonic partials.

The bow in the one case and the jet stream in the other are the<br/>cause of the phase locking.</p><p>&gt; See also Brown, Judith C. 1996. &quot;Frequency ratios of spectral<br/>&gt; components of musical sounds&quot; J.

But in fact the browser plugin works great and<br/>.djvu pages load instantly which is a vast improvement over the Acrobotch<br/>Reader plugin, and the text quality is a little wierd but certainly more<br/>readable than many pdf&apos;s.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s an interesting set of results in that paper, thanks.  I&apos;ll<br/>have to spend a little more time to assimilate it.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=53907 href="#53907">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2004 2:24:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But also a static sound can create that perception becuase of<br/>&gt; slight head<br/>&gt; &gt; movements and because of wand&apos;rings of the acoustic attention.<br/>You<br/>&gt; know the<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomenon wherein you listen to a harmonically rich static sound<br/>&gt; source,<br/>&gt; &gt; and *think* a tune and this causes the tune you think to appear<br/>to<br/>&gt; manifest<br/>&gt; &gt; as *real* ?

Consider yourself lucky if you even make to<br/>to<br/>&gt; 768, let alone farther.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if you guys mean soft synths or keyboards or modules,<br/>but I&apos;ve had a lot of success creating soundfonts from the sounds I<br/>want to use.  It&apos;s roundabout, but it is possible to sample the<br/>desired sound; create a soundfont using it; play the necessary notes<br/>using pitch bend and record as separate audio files; then make<br/>another soundfont from the already bent pitches.  It&apos;s also possible<br/>to use separate bits for the original sf in order to reflect the<br/>cutoff frequencies and such or to make the instrument sound more<br/>natural.<br/>My main reason for doing it this way is that my soundcard often<br/>applies the pitch bend a microsecond into the note.  On the downside<br/>you get a chromolodeon-like spread of pitches, but on the plus side<br/>you can play them any of them at the same time.</p><p>-Chuckk</p></div>
