It is an amazing installation. D beardsley can give you most of the lowdown. I know a portion of the primes are what Hennix calls twin Young primes --or something to that effect like for example-17&amp;19 ,29 &amp;31 [examples<br/>not necessarily in the piece]. And as regards to the primes some very interesting ones  tend to lay a comma, a liemma(no not a lumma) or a diesis away from the normal ratios-if there is such a thing.</p><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Dave Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the thread &quot;higher numbered nonsense...&quot;, Patrick Pagano &lt;<a href="mailto:ppagano@bellsouth.net">ppagano@bellsouth.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;Have you heard the piece (9:7:4.....<br/>&gt; &gt;would you like to discuss it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;i had a chance to experience LaMontes High numbered &quot;nonsense&quot; and nonsense<br/>&gt; &gt;it is not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, no fair Patrick.
