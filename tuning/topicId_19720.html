Nobody seems to have tried to find<br/>this out; nobody, now, would consider it &quot;normal&quot; even to try to<br/>investigate it.</p><p>Moreover, the cats all over the world also may have the same<br/>frequency to cry in!  For example, &quot;shreeswifty&quot;&apos;s cat and Seth&apos;s<br/>cat, along with our cat, named Shanti (meaning peace, as she is very<br/>quiet), can be the population for a model study!  All the cats DO<br/>have one thing in common: they all &apos;purr&apos; in very low frequencies<br/>(close to 25 Hz).</p><p>How serious such studies be?  Is there a prima facie case for such<br/>studies to be undertaken at all? Ridiculous?  Strange?  &quot;Different&quot;?</p><p>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=19736 href="#19736">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

Not only do all cats not meow at<br/>the same frequency, but all cats meow at a different average frequency.  Some only make very high<br/>pitched sounds (many solid color domestics, cheetas), some only very low (most Siamese, tigers and<br/>lions), and some in between (most tabbies).  In addition, most cats make a variety of sounds at<br/>different pitches ranging over an octave for each cat.  I would consider it a ridiculous waste of<br/>time to try to pin down cat cries to a single pitch.  You might as well try to determine a single<br/>pitch at which opera singers sing, or a single pitch that pianos make.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

I<br/>read in the National Geographic that they purr at a low F below the staff.<br/>It is fairly regular, perhaps and earlier stage for the perfect pitch gene?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
