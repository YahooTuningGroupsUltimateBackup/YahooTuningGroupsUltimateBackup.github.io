From a singer&apos;s point of view moving<br/>&gt; an octave is not going nowhere. It is a substantial movement and requires<br/>&gt; quite an adjustment of the vocal apparatus. I meant to suggest a way to<br/>&gt; increase one&apos;s ability to sing large intervals. I should have used a<br/>&gt; different interval, say a major tenth, to illustrate my point. And if<br/>&gt; anyone would ask, where is a singer ever asked to sing a major tenth, I<br/>&gt; would reply that it is required several times in Chopin&apos;s Nocturne in Eb,<br/>&gt; Opus 9, No. 2, which will NOT be on my forthcoming CD (maybe the next<br/>&gt; one?). And if one can sing a major tenth with ease then the usual sort of<br/>&gt; big intervals will be a breeze.</p><p>Thanks, John, but I didn&apos;t really miss it. It simply reminded me that when<br/>singers think of intervals--even wide ones--simply as pitch changes rather<br/>than traveling &quot;distances,&quot; the execution is vocally easier. As you likely<br/>know, carrying the &quot;weight&quot; of low register pitches into high register<br/>pitches, as many singers try to do, frustrates the attempt. Thinking of wide<br/>pitch changes as &quot;slow vibrations&quot; to &quot;fast vibrations&quot; helps to keep vocal<br/>&quot;weight&quot; out of the picture. That&apos;s what I meant by &quot;gone nowhere,&quot; and the<br/>&quot;almost&quot; was added to acknowledge the skill that it takes to execute such<br/>distances effortlessly.</p><p>Since this has little to do with tuning, perhaps we should (if you care to)<br/>continue this thread off List.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
