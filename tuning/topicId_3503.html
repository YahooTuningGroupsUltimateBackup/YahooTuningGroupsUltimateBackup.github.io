TD 213.2]<br/>&gt; as recorded by the Fitzwilliam String Quartet on London 411 643-2.<br/>&gt; There is no doubt in my mind that the performers strived to do at<br/>&gt; least a 5-limit JI tuning of this passage (and perhaps even a few<br/>&gt; 7-limit dominant chords) in a senza vibrato style. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; I never thought this rendition sounded &quot;un-Beethoven&quot;ish - I think<br/>&gt; if he would have been able to hear it this way (and maybe he did<br/>&gt; in his brain), he would have liked it.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve ever heard this performance (I think I used<br/>to own it), but to me what you describe has always seemed the<br/>proper kind of tuning for this piece.</p><p>Joseph L.
