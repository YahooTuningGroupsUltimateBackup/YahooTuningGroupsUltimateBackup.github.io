Curiously, like<br/>Tomas de Santa Maria, I would place a great deal of emphasis on<br/>composing or improvising in rather simple four-voice textures, as well<br/>as on more elaborate techniques (e.g. imitation and canon, double<br/>counterpoint).</p><p>This isn&apos;t by any means to exclude awareness of the later &quot;species&quot;<br/>method, a very interesting aspect of musical and pedagogical culture<br/>in its own right, as one might say. However, the original 16th-century<br/>methods and some 20th-century adaptations seem to me more &quot;direct,&quot;<br/>just as the term implies, and encourage immersion both in actual<br/>16th-century music and its theoretical explanation at the time.</p><p>One such modern textbook, which has inspired lots of offshoots (some<br/>with the benefits of a half century of scholarship since) is Gustav<br/>Fredric Soderlund&apos;s _Direct Approach to Counterpoint in 16th century<br/>style_.[1]</p><p>In selecting some materials given special emphasis here, I&apos;ve<br/>doubtless been influenced by my own predilections, which often may be<br/>rather different than those of a typical academic department -- and<br/>may or may not be that different from those of others on this List.</p><p>For example, I highly recommend Vicentino&apos;s _Ancient Music Adapted to<br/>Modern Practice_ (1555), conveniently available in a complete modern<br/>English translation[2], both for its discussion of 16th-century common<br/>practice _and_ its presentation of the chromatic and enharmonic<br/>genera, questions of intonation and temperament, etc.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s Third Book from his _Harmonic Institutions_ (1558),<br/>available in English translation as _The Art of Counterpoint_[3],<br/>provides a more conventional view with its own insights and judgments<br/>of taste, including some remarks on intonation.</p><p>Both books present the state of the art around the middle of the 16th<br/>century, the epoch of Palestrina&apos;s youth. Obviously an analysis of<br/>Palestrina&apos;s style itself, or that of his contemporary Orlando di<br/>Lasso who is often taken in academic counterpoint studies as a<br/>somewhat more flexible model, must date from a somewhat later era.</p><p>Some valuable sources are included in a book by Knud Jeppesen which<br/>may serve as a companion to his _Counterpoint_, or as a valuable<br/>independent reference: _The Style of Palestrina and the<br/>Dissonance_.[4]</p><p>Here we encounter some issues involving historical value judgments. At<br/>the time Jeppesen was writing, both he and others regarded the music<br/>of the later 16th century, and more especially Palestrina, as the<br/>culmination of all earlier medieval and Renaissance European polyphony<br/>going back to the 9th century. This viewpoint is amply reflected both<br/>in his discussions of Gothic styles -- far less well known in theory<br/>and practice then than they are now -- and also in his treatment of<br/>composers around 1500 such Ockeghem, Obrecht, and Josquin.</p><p>Today, when Gothic approaches to stability/instability and also the<br/>distinctive achievements of the Josquin generation are recognized as<br/>just as &quot;central&quot; as the late 16th century, an approach to the<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic era (say, for our present purposes, 1450-1640)<br/>might draw on a much wider range of stylistic models and genres.</p><p>Also, while Gothic and Renaissance/Manneristic techniques have<br/>contrasting intonational and other aesthetic aspects which makes their<br/>separate study a not unnatural approach, they also share certain<br/>themes such as &quot;closest approach&quot;[5] progressions which might well be<br/>brought out even while focusing on manifestations within a given era.</p><p>Although following to a degree the usual academic tradition by giving<br/>a main emphasis to the middle and later 16th century, I have felt free<br/>to include the earlier part of the century also when it seems helpful<br/>to develop certain themes such as note-against-writing for voices or<br/>instruments which play a role throughout the era.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>1. Fux, Jeppesen, and species counterpoint<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>As has been explained by earlier contributions to this thread, the<br/>famous treatise _Gradus ad Parnassum_ by J.J. Fux (1725) is an<br/>18th-century view of modal counterpoint based on Palestrina&apos;s style as<br/>known at that time -- in contrast to a 16th-century or 20th-21st<br/>century view.</p><p>This does not make Fux&apos;s text less valuable as a beautiful piece of<br/>musical literature, and also as an expression of the modal system as<br/>it continued to exert influence in an era where major/minor tonality<br/>was becoming the dominant paradigm in theory as well as practice. From<br/>this perspective, Fux&apos;s treatment of the modes in a quasi-16th-century<br/>setting might be compared to that of Kirnberger in the more &quot;modern&quot;<br/>setting of 18th-century liturgical music, for example that of<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s teacher J. S. Bach.</p><p>In order to present the art of composition in Palestrina&apos;s manner<br/>using a &quot;step by step&quot; approach, Fux adopts a &quot;species&quot; approach.<br/>While one aspect of his teaching method has precedents in late Gothic<br/>and Renaissance approaches, the elaborate system of species we are<br/>about to consider seems to have its roots mainly in post-1600<br/>presentations.</p><p>Following a long tradition, Fux has the student begin with two-voice<br/>settings in note-against-note style, the literal meaning in fact of<br/>the novel 14th-century term _contrapunctus_ or &quot;point against point.&quot;<br/>As Zarlino (1558) explains, this approach (if one follows 15th-16th<br/>century conventions) restricts the new student to the use of<br/>(Renaissance) consonances only, and is necessary in order to learn the<br/>art of finding these basic consonances and moving from one to another<br/>before getting enmeshed in the complications and greater liberties of<br/>a more elaborate style.</p><p>For Fux, note-against-style is the &quot;First Species.&quot; While 16th-century<br/>teachers including Zarlino simply proceed from here to &quot;diminished<br/>counterpoint&quot; where smaller note values, fluid rhythms, and<br/>suspensions are presented more or less together, however, Fux takes<br/>this process methodically, step-by-step, over four more distinct<br/>&quot;species.&quot;</p><p>Thus the &quot;Second Species&quot; involves two notes in the added melody<br/>against one in the original melody or _cantus firmus_; here<br/>dissonances may be placed in certain circumstances on unstressed<br/>beats.</p><p>The &quot;Third Species&quot; similarly involves four notes against one, with<br/>Fux&apos;s rules somewhat differing from those of Palestrina&apos;s practice, as<br/>Jeppesen discusses.</p><p>The &quot;Fourth Species&quot; consists of suspensions placed as often as<br/>possible between the two voices, and introduces the most idiomatic<br/>form of cadential dissonance.</p><p>Finally, the &quot;Fifth Species&quot; or &quot;florid&quot; style combines all of the<br/>other four.</p><p>This is the basic approach of Fux, first moving through the species of<br/>two-voice counterpoint, then moving on to three or more voices.</p><p>Jeppesen, in his teaching approach, seeks a kind of synthesis between<br/>Fux&apos;s pedagogy and a more systematic and &quot;authentic&quot; appreciation of<br/>Palestrina&apos;s actual late 16th-century style: he follows Fux&apos;s species<br/>method, but with the rules based on his very thorough research and<br/>study of such matters as dissonance treatment.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. A &quot;direct&quot; (and somewhat keyboard-oriented) approach<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Turning from Fux or Jeppesen to 16th-century methods, we find a<br/>&quot;standard&quot; approach starting with note-against-note writing for two<br/>voices, then moving to &quot;diminished&quot; or florid counterpoint for two<br/>voices, and from there to the question of managing three or more<br/>voices.</p><p>Vicentino, Zarlino, and Thomas Morley (1597)[6] present a range of<br/>variations on this basic theme, and it remains a very natural<br/>progression favored by 20th-century advocates of a &quot;direct&quot; approach<br/>also.[7]</p><p>However, one might supplement this outlook with another approach to<br/>16th-century music taken by Tomas de Santa Maria in his _Book on the<br/>Art of Playing Fantasia_[8], where &quot;fantasia&quot; might be translated<br/>roughly as &quot;composed or improvised music often featuring four-voice<br/>sonorities moving mostly note-against-note.&quot;</p><p>Like other authors, Santa Maria introduces the rudiments of music such<br/>as two-voice intervals and their classification under the stylistic<br/>norms of the time as consonances or dissonances; he also presents a<br/>very interesting discussion of the modes, and a survey of some common<br/>cadential figures.</p><p>From here, however, he focuses especially on the art of managing basic<br/>four-voice sonorities, regarding the bass and highest voice as<br/>principal, with the middle voices adding &quot;accompanying consonances&quot;<br/>and &quot;filling out the space&quot; between these outer parts.</p><p>As scholars have recently noted, his theory nicely fits the practice<br/>of keyboard composers such as Antonio de Cabezon[9] -- and also, at<br/>least in my opinion, of much vocal music in mostly note-against-note<br/>style around 1500 or 1550.</p><p>Synthesizing standard 16th-century methods with those of Santa Maria,<br/>we might approach the style by following two concurrent threads:<br/>patterns and progressions in simple four-voice textures, and a<br/>progression through the usual topics and techniques from two-voice<br/>writing to three or more voices.</p><p>One advantage of rapid immersion in basic four-voice textures is that<br/>it permits an appreciation of such themes as Zarlino&apos;s _harmonia<br/>perfetta_ (full or complete sonority as defined in 16th-century<br/>terms), typical progressions and patterns of modal cadences, and some<br/>simple suspension idioms. This early exposure can lend zest to the<br/>gradual process of exploring the rules and intricacies of more<br/>elaborate writing.</p><p>Another advantage is that a feeling for basic four-voice textures can<br/>nicely bring out some of the main intonational issues and preferences<br/>of this era -- for example, qualities of meantone temperament for<br/>keyboards (also experienced, of course, in textures with fewer<br/>voices).</p><p>A special attraction of Santa Maria is that he presents a 16th-century<br/>approach to the description of four-voice sonorities, making this a<br/>fundamental theme of his approach -- although Zarlino has very<br/>important discussions of multi-voice sonorities also, and the two both<br/>contribute to a balanced picture. Personally I much favor approaching<br/>these sonorities in &quot;authentic&quot; 16th-century terms, although here<br/>tastes and learning styles may vary.</p><p>More specifically, my situation in approaching Gothic and Renaissance<br/>music as my first style to learn may be quite different from that of<br/>someone with a background in some non-European tradition, or in an<br/>18th-19th century European tradition. Happily, there are a wide range<br/>of approaches to choose from.</p><p>----------<br/>3. Summary<br/>----------</p><p>An assortment of 16th-century and later texts offer three different<br/>types of approaches, which might be combined in various ways:</p><p>(1) A &quot;classic&quot; 16th-century progression from note-against-note<br/>writing in two voices, to florid or &quot;diminished&quot; counterpoint in two<br/>voices, to textures with larger numbers of voices (Vicentino, Zarlino,<br/>Morley -- and also modern writers such as Soderlund). In 20th-century<br/>versions of this approach, there tends to be a focus on late<br/>16th-century vocal music, with Palestrina and Lasso often getting<br/>major emphasis.</p><p>(2) A &quot;four-voice&quot; approach emphasizing note-against-note style (Santa<br/>Maria), which could be developed in modern texts possibly defining a<br/>new pedagogical category like &quot;16th-century keyboard harmony&quot; or the<br/>like -- although many vocal as well instrumental pieces fit into the<br/>general category of this style. This outlook may lend itself to a<br/>broad sampling of composers ranging from the often dancelike songs of<br/>Juan del Encina and his colleagues around 1500, to the note-against-<br/>note keyboard music of Cabezon, to some sacred vocal music of<br/>Palestrina and Lasso.</p><p>(3) A &quot;species&quot; approach of the kind made famous by Fux, and adapted<br/>by Jeppesen to a more thorough 20th-century analysis of Palestrina&apos;s<br/>style.</p><p>Typically one might combine (1) and (2), while even if (3) is not<br/>chosen as a primary learning strategy, an explanation of the species<br/>at some point can be very helpful background.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

For me, anyway, it<br/>seems that counterpoint is a really crucial study to those interested<br/>in xenharmonic music, particularly since the &quot;old&quot; or &quot;former&quot; rules<br/>of traditional harmonic usage are no longer as applicable.<br/>Counterpoint is, at least, something we can &quot;depend&quot; on... and it<br/>crosses time and cultures.</p><p>In fact, one can even view TEXTURAL development as a counterpoint of<br/>sorts and, in fact, I personally would advocate such as a way of<br/>expanding the term for musical procedures evident in our own time.<br/>Taken in this way, even composers like David Beardsley, who use<br/>&quot;static&quot; textures, could be seen to be using a counterpoint of sorts<br/>when the textures change.  I suppose such a study, when resulting in<br/>simultenaity could also be called &quot;modern harmony,&quot; but I would<br/>prefer the more inclusive, LINEAR and FREER classifications of<br/>counterpoint.</p><p>It seems a bit ironic that in our day and age we know so much MORE<br/>about Renaissance composers than they did in the 18th century.  It<br/>seems that as time progresses the human ability to investigate and<br/>research (dare I say, &quot;snoop&quot;) becomes more and more refined. Without<br/>getting too OT, I would say that these &quot;techniques&quot; are currently<br/>being shown in our investigations of the private lives of our public<br/>officials and other &quot;celebrities...&quot;  These &quot;data gathering&quot;<br/>tendencies should not, necessarily, be viewed as something &quot;evil.&quot;<br/>Rather, society is going to have to learn how to deal with the more<br/>intensive scrutiny in a mature way.  The Internet and the omnipresent<br/>ability for ANYONE to investigate just about ANYTHING about every<br/>living human being is one ramification of this trend.  I do not in<br/>any way find this disturbing... (but, I don&apos;t even find &quot;genetic<br/>research&quot; disurbing!) But these ARE social trends to which we will<br/>have to adjust.</p><p>Getting quickly back to music :), I would say that I would celebrate<br/>the investigative techniques since they obviously magnified the<br/>importance of &quot;freer&quot; composers of the Renaissance, such as Orlando<br/>di Lasso and, probably, Gesualdo... some of my personal favorites,<br/>although I must say that there are those times that the stately grace<br/>of Palestrina and Victoria serve as a powerful solace (probably they<br/>did in their OWN age too!)</p><p>In any case, I guess it would make sense that the composers to FIRST<br/>be investigated in a systematic way would BE the most systematic<br/>composers... such as Palestrina.  I&apos;m glad, however, that the more<br/>thorough research is bringing the &quot;looser, creative&quot; types into<br/>greater prominance... at least as evidenced by Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>interesting comments.</p><p>Correspondingly, it would seem that the emphasis on contrapuntal<br/>techniques is also changing, to the more &quot;direct&quot; methods we have<br/>seen in the short monograph by Ernst Krenek, of which we were so<br/>helpfully reminded by Kraig Grady.</p><p>It does seem that an elaborate &quot;species&quot; method of counterpoint<br/>instruction is somewhat outdated...  Personally, though, I find the<br/>Fux book a &quot;hoot&quot; since it is so well written and practically<br/>&quot;comical&quot; in certain sections -- in the clever interactions between<br/>teacher and pupil.  It is also enjoyable to see the examples<br/>progressing through such a thorough and systematic method.</p><p>Upon further appraisal of the Walter Piston book, which I also own, I<br/>should say that, in reality, it is quite good, and stresses 17th and<br/>18th century counterpoint, rather than 16th.  Bach is given special<br/>prominence.  The section on &quot;invertible&quot; or &quot;double&quot; counterpoint is<br/>also quite fine.  For those wondering what this is, &quot;invertible&quot;<br/>counterpoint is simply the process of moving voices around in<br/>different registers and making everything &quot;work out.&quot;  Naturally,<br/>such &quot;inversions&quot; occur principally, in &quot;traditional&quot; music at<br/>&quot;harmonic&quot; intervals... the octave, 12th and 15th... The term<br/>&quot;double&quot; counterpoint is used when TWO voices transpose around, not<br/>just one.  There is even TRIPLE counterpoint where elements A,B,C are<br/>combined in every possible way in a three-voiced texture.  Bach uses<br/>many ofthese techniques in the Well Tempered Clavier...</p><p>The discussion on this list has encouraged me to do a little<br/>&quot;shopping&quot; on <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, and I look forward to receiving a copy of<br/>Jeppesen (which I have heard of, but never had in my library) and<br/>Salzer/Schacter.  The Salzer/Schacter approach SEEMS more attuned to<br/>the Piston approach of viewing counterpoint &quot;in action&quot; as it were<br/>in pieces through many eras.  I&apos;m anxious to read it, though, since<br/>it seems to emphasize more a &quot;Schenkerian&quot; approached, whereas Piston<br/>is decidedly OPPOSED to Schenker.

I should be getting both Vicentino and Krenek<br/>&gt; around the middle of next week.</p><p>The Krenek is a short work, but emphasizes the various &quot;step<br/>procedures&quot; in writing a &quot;Renaissance&quot; melody depending on the note<br/>values... In other words, he will say, use skips first and then steps<br/>in ascending melodies in half notes, etc.  I don&apos;t have my copy right<br/>here, so I can&apos;t be more specific, but it&apos;s that kind of thing... a<br/>general approach to writing melodies in that style with different<br/>note values.  Hence, it would pertain as well to Lasso and some of<br/>the &quot;freer&quot; contrapuntalists as much as to Palestrina...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It does seem that an elaborate &quot;species&quot; method of counterpoint<br/>&gt; &gt; instruction is somewhat outdated...  Personally, though, I find<br/>the Fux book a &quot;hoot&quot; since it is so well written and practically<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;comical&quot; in certain sections -- in the clever interactions<br/>between teacher and pupil.  It is also enjoyable to see the examples<br/>&gt; &gt; progressing through such a thorough and systematic method.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s strange how a method of analysis can be seen as antiquated,<br/>when the music it analyses hasn&apos;t changed.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ummm. Not really.  Look at &quot;Roman Numeral Analysis&quot; of Baroque music.<br/> Constructing everything and analyzing from a &quot;figured bass&quot; was all<br/>the rage, previously in the 19th century.  TODAY, it&apos;s considered<br/>a little &quot;outmoded&quot; and more &quot;linear&quot; methods and &quot;reductive&quot;<br/>methods, as well as overall modulatory analysis of SHAPE are more<br/>featured...</p><p>Music theory tastes &quot;come and go&quot; but the music remains!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Upon further appraisal of the Walter Piston book, which I also<br/>own, I should say that, in reality, it is quite good, and stresses<br/>17th and 18th century counterpoint, rather than 16th.  Bach is given<br/>special prominence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sounds interesting, then.  I expect the library&apos;ll have it, but I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; try to &quot;do&quot; the 16th Century first.</p><p>Right.  I wouldn&apos;t BUY it, if I didn&apos;t HAVE it.  I think there are<br/>more &quot;exciting&quot; ones...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The section on &quot;invertible&quot; or &quot;double&quot; counterpoint is<br/>&gt; &gt; also quite fine.  For those wondering what this is, &quot;invertible&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; counterpoint is simply the process of moving voices around in<br/>&gt; &gt; different registers and making everything &quot;work out.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You say &quot;simply&quot; but I still think I&apos;ll need a book to get the hang<br/>&gt; of it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You won&apos;t find it too difficult once you see it in &quot;action...&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; The discussion on this list has encouraged me to do a little<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;shopping&quot; on <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, and I look forward to receiving a copy<br/>of Jeppesen (which I have heard of, but never had in my library) and<br/>&gt; &gt; Salzer/Schacter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would it make sense to follow a library copy of Fux, but get<br/>Jeppesen for permanent reference?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well... Fux is a fun read, and at about $11 a pretty good buy.  Both<br/>are inexpensive paperbacks...</p><p> &gt; &gt; The Salzer/Schacter approach SEEMS more attuned to<br/>&gt; &gt; the Piston approach of viewing counterpoint &quot;in action&quot; as it were<br/>&gt; &gt; in pieces through many eras.  I&apos;m anxious to read it, though,<br/>since it seems to emphasize more a &quot;Schenkerian&quot; approached, whereas<br/>&gt; Piston is decidedly OPPOSED to Schenker.  Piston feels that the<br/>beauty is in the DETAILS of counterpoint, and Schenkerian reductions,<br/>reducing great music to skeletons, are pointless...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schenkerian analysis of counterpoint sounds interesting.
