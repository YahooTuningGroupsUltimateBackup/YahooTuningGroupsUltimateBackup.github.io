<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Ferneyhough & microtones</h1><h3><a id=41504 href="#41504">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;cb202@columbia.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2002 7:44:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It is true that nearly all of his pieces, (where it&apos;s possible), involve<br/>heavy dosages of quarter- or 8th-tones.  It would be fair to say that it&apos;s<br/>all in 24-tet or even 48-tet.</p><p>However, this really doesn&apos;t get at the juice of Ferneyhough&apos;s approach,<br/>which a lot of the time isn&apos;t directly about pitch at all.  It&apos;s about<br/>getting  instruments and their players into certain situations, where the<br/>sounds that come out are unpredictable (at least from the point of view<br/>of the player) usually involve a high degree of noise and gestural (i.e.<br/>theatrical) content.  (And of course, microtonality)   And because the<br/>player is trying to get out sounds  but often not quite able to do so<br/>(because of the way the piece is very  intentionally written),  the result<br/>is often highly expressive.</p><p>&#x9;I find this fascinating---this relationship he posits between<br/>notation,  telling the player what to do, but not notating the sound which<br/>comes out, and then the sound wich DOES come out.</p><p>&#x9;I think this is an interesting approach to compare to the thinking<br/>that usually goes on on this list.   Here, we are very obssessed with<br/>tuning things exactly, in short, we are obssessed with pitch structure.<br/>We construct pitch structures, and then, we struggle to<br/>find instruments to realize them.  Some of us (most of us) resort to MIDI<br/>or other electronics,  some of us build instruments to do it.</p><p>&#x9;Ferneyhough starts with the instrument itself---what is structured<br/>is the theatre of what the player is doing with the instrument,  above<br/>all.  The result, with any instrument capable of microtones, is decidedly<br/>non-ET music.  Thoroughly (not ornamentally) microtonal, to be sure.  It<br/>also, in fact, has a very world-musicky character to it;<br/>in fact I prefer it in this respect compared to, say, George Crumb,<br/>because of what I mentioned in my last e-mail:  Ferneyhough&apos;s working with<br/>his own set of bizarre issues,  which happen to &quot;acidentally&quot; sound like<br/>PErsian Ney solo or what-have-you, now and then---this kind of<br/>&quot;accidentallity&quot; of the &quot;cultural influence&quot; in his music I find more<br/>powerful than what one gets with Crumb, who tends to &quot;wear his<br/>multi-culturalism on his sleeve.&quot;</p><p>&#x9;Anyway, as a speaker/writer I find him kind of pompous and unable<br/>to make any sense whatsoever, and I&apos;m not too eager to hang out with the<br/>new-complexity crowd, socially speaking,  but I do like the music.</p><p>cb</p></div>
