No matter which<br/>frequency you hold constant?  What of Keenan&apos;s idea of measuring the period<br/>of the VF?</p><p>&gt;What I just found for the last case is that in fact the width is, to an<br/>even &gt;better approximation that the one for the first (Farey) case,<br/>inversely &gt;proportional to the _square root_ of the product of the<br/>numerator and &gt;denominator.</p><p>Drat!

I should have said: &quot;For this table,<br/>0/0 is defined as 1.&quot;</p><p>The analogies with silence and white noise are worth responding to. My<br/>table was one of all the possible rational dyads in lowest terms , ordered<br/>in terms of d, and then n (thus making it related to but not identical to<br/>Farey series). Noise is not a dyad. Silence could be a dyad with amplitude<br/>zero, but that presents an ontological question well beyond my meagre<br/>talents.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

It&apos;s also a terribly convenient way for<br/>&gt;&gt;setting unisons apart from all other intervals.</p><p>&gt;Gee, I thought things divided by 0 were usually infinite.</p><p>But 0 divided by things is usually zero. Zero divided by zero is one of<br/>the seven undefined terms of arithmetic. This convention is very helpful<br/>in many areas of mathematics, including calculus. If I recall correctly,<br/>the seven undefined terms are:</p><p>0/0<br/>inf/inf<br/>0*inf<br/>inf-inf<br/>1^inf<br/>inf^0<br/>0^0</p><p>(where inf means infinity). Each of these can take on a different value<br/>based on the &quot;usually&quot; argument, but the first six of them can in fact<br/>be thought of as taking on any possible value, call it x, due to the<br/>following &quot;checks&quot;:</p><p>x*0 = 0 -&gt; 0/0 = x<br/>x*inf = inf -&gt; inf/inf = x<br/>x/0 = inf (or x/inf = 0) -&gt; 0*inf = x<br/>x+inf = inf -&gt; inf-inf = x<br/>infth root of x = 1 -&gt; 1^inf = x<br/>0th root of x = inf -&gt; inf^0 = x</p><p>The last one is undefined because it can be either zero or one: things<br/>to the 0 are usually 1, but 0 to the things is usually 0.</p><p>(Someone correct me if this isn&apos;t the right seven.)</p><p>&gt;The nifty thing about the mediant is that it divides the space between<br/>two<br/>&gt;fractions by finding the simplest one in between.  That makes sense.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t understand this new geometric mean entropy...  The geometric<br/>mean<br/>&gt;may split the space between two ratios into portions of equal<br/>logarithmic<br/>&gt;size, but why should the brain/ear care about that?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re confused about something: the fact is that the<br/>mediant is used in all these formulations, and the parameter<br/>(denominator, numerator, arithmetic mean, geometric mean) only defines<br/>the set of fractions for which mediants are computed.</p><p>Assuming you weren&apos;t confused about that . . .</p><p>Well, if you are comparing intevals by starting with a unison and then<br/>spreading the two notes apart by equal amounts, then the set of all<br/>ratios whose VF is above a fixed lower bound will be the set for which<br/>the geometric mean of the numerator and denominator is below a fixed<br/>upper bound.</p></div>
