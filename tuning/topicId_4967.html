The one bone of contention I have<br/>is:</p><p>&gt;One point of view, and probably a controversial one at that, holds sine<br/>waves<br/>&gt;to be what I&apos;ll call a &quot;minimal harmonic timbre&quot;, and as such will be the<br/>&gt;minimal optimal timbre for both harmonic and subharmonic chords.</p><p>I would say that sine waves are in no way an optimal timbre for subharmonic<br/>(utonal) chords. Of course, Daniel and I have been through this before, and<br/>he claims he can tune sine waves to subharmonic chords with astounding<br/>accuracy. I can&apos;t, and am drawn instead to harmonic chords (e.g, 10:12:15:17<br/>for the 7-limit utonality) when trying to do so. An acoustic guitar is the<br/>best timbre for utonal chords I&apos;ve found so far.</p></div><h3><a id=4975 href="#4975">ðŸ”—</a>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/1999 7:34:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel,</p><p>I may retune the instrument and fine tune the partials in the future, or<br/>perhaps over an extended time.  I am not sure it will be more valuable<br/>either way.</p><p>By mounting the bars at the .22 node, with velcro, the upper modes are<br/>muted.  I will also use a relatively soft striker positioned to strike the<br/>antinode of the fundamental.<br/>  So far, I have found it possible to mute the upper modes -- the third can<br/>be faintly heard, but decays<br/>very quickly.</p><p>Actually, describing the instrument as a carillon is probably erroneous.  A<br/>&quot;true&quot; carillon is made from cast bells, 2 octaves or more, with a flemish<br/>tuning (minor third partial), and is played on a mechanical<br/>keyboard -pounded with the fists.</p><p>The original Schulmerich &quot;carillon&quot; that my instrument is based on uses<br/>double brass rods (minor third apart) and a very complex tuning method that<br/>yeilds a characteristic carillon sound (although I have not heard these<br/>bells, yet)</p><p>It has never been my intention to mimic a carillon sound.  If I wanted to do<br/>that, I would have bought a sampler ;-)</p><p>Darren</p><p>&gt;----- Finally, regarding Darren Burgess&apos;s carillon project.  I understand<br/>&gt;that you have decided, for practical reasons, not to fine tune the 2nd and<br/>&gt;3rd modes.  But I don&apos;t understand how you will eliminate the (untuned)<br/>modes<br/>&gt;without use of a filter or mute of some sort.  above and beyond the issue<br/>of<br/>&gt;loudspeakers, the idea of getting a sine wave out of a struck rod sounds a<br/>&gt;bit strange, perhaps you meant only to say that the just intervals would be<br/>&gt;between the fundamentals?  Even if you do filter out the upper partials,<br/>&gt;wouldn&apos;t you end up with something that sounds not at all like a carillon?<br/>&gt;</p></div>
