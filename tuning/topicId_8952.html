Is<br/>&gt;this correct? There is also no description of the book or CDs contents<br/>&gt;at the site, maybe you or another author could stick something there?<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, the title of the book has changed, and apparently I got a listing<br/>under the old title. The correct title is _The Csound Book_. The full<br/>contents and text of some chapters is available at:</p><p><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/fpage/pub/csbook/csbook.html">http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/fpage/pub/csbook/csbook.html</a></p><p>My chapter (editorially retitled, unfortunately, to fit into the MIDI<br/>section) is on the CD-ROM, as is the complete score and orchestra of a<br/>freely modulating JI piece of mine, Hiway 70. More information about Csound<br/>is now at:</p><p><a href="http://www.csound.org/">http://www.csound.org/</a></p><p>&gt;I&apos;m probably not alone in being very interested in CSound but anything<br/>&gt;that would help get me over the learning curve could be the thing to<br/>&gt;make me take the plunge. (&quot;curve? plunge?...&quot;)</p><p>The CD-ROMs that come with the book are helpful in that regard in that it<br/>has hundreds of ready-made instruments. Many more along with their sounds<br/>are available on the Csound Catalog CD-ROM (available separately).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By the way, I really enjoyed your tape and will probably upgrade to<br/>&gt;the CD version. Hope you have some more projects in the pipe.</p><p>Thanks!
