Tyler and myself are also admin.</p><p>We welcome general xen discussion, in fact i have just renamed one of the subforums to exactly that. Although called xenguitarist there is no expectation members should own a xen guitar or bass. Since we lost nonoctave the web is missing an independant xen forum, i feel like opening out the xenguitarist forum a little to more general xen discussion, i hope Ron thinks this is a good idea heh.</p><p>Gedankenwelt is there and has posted some well presented theory posts, there are some members who refuse to join FB and who resent the recent hidng of the XA forum from the public, as i do too. I actually reluctantly joined FB recently to access the xenharmonic alliance II (there i am menokefug sonataris). I don&apos;t feel like fully engaging in the FB XA because it is not public ... not everyone is on FB.</p><p>Mat (ix) la rampe.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2013 8:20:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;ixlramp&quot; &lt;mat.gregory@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The former microtonal guitarist forum is back online at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenguitarist.com/">http://xenguitarist.com/</a><br/>&gt; Thus is perhaps the only independant dedicated xen forum online,<br/>&gt; it is owned by Ron Sword.
