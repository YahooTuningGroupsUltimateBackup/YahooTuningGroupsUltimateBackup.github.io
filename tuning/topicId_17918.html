A pseudo pedal steel hitch pin arrangement would take some<br/>engineering at modern tensions. I&apos;ve heard about a prototype piano<br/>tuning machine that took forever.</p><p>There&apos;s Nicola Vicentino&apos;s vertically adaptive system for the<br/>arcicembalo, also Scipione Stella and Fabio Colonna&apos;s Sambuca lincea<br/>(clavichord -&gt; bebung!). Then several inventors during the early 19th<br/>century built instruments to increase the range of pitches available to<br/>a performer, unlike most earlier extended instruments they didn&apos;t<br/>complicate the keyboard and were designed explicitly for JI. Harding<br/>mentions Charles Clagget, William Hawkes, and David Loeschman, Jorgensen<br/>adds Henry Liston and Charles Broughton; all of them employed stops to<br/>introduce supplementary pitches, available in form of additional strings<br/>or pipes, or adjustable string or pipe length. Their combination<br/>permitted Liston to suggest hundreds of pitches might be built into<br/>instruments like his Euharmonic organ.</p><p>Eivind Groven worked on an extended piano along with an organ. The piano<br/>employed a switching array hooked up to a keyboard, controlling three<br/>pneumatic player pianos in JI. David Loberg Code&apos;s Groven Project uses<br/>solenoid driven MIDI players, much as Patrick Ozzard Low describes for<br/>the logical piano in his book. (Pity, I think there&apos;s a much larger<br/>dynamic range to the old, messy pneumatic reproducing pianos than<br/>possible with solenoids)</p><p>Clark Battle is building a small upright piano that&apos;s able to gliss,<br/>also immediately to switch between four tunings (he specifically<br/>mentions JI, too) with up to 40 notes. I don&apos;t know how it works,<br/>though! He was inspired by a Kenny Werner concert.</p><p>I spent some time considering options for piano after a performance by<br/>Curtis Bahn on Saturday. He performs with a modified electric upright<br/>which triggers all sorts of computer stuff, from what I could tell<br/>through pitch, position, bowing, and a couple continuous controllers<br/>mounted to the instrument. Pretty amazing, except it didn&apos;t feed back to<br/>the instrument - the Audioforte Music Reproduction System is something<br/>that could by driving a soundboard. Something I&apos;m considering, and which<br/>Reed Ghazala actually has implemented (also, Clementi I think patented<br/>something like it) is to make advantage of string partials. The simpler<br/>method is to build a mute that touches the strings, in existing forms at<br/>half their length; a more complex version would use solenoids to push<br/>felt fingers to a selected node independently for each string. A global<br/>actuation, like by a pedal would change the timbre but also transpose<br/>the instrument, but software similar in function to sostenuto could lend<br/>adaptive qualities: say, depress a key, push the pedal and subsequent<br/>notes would play related partials. This might be developed further<br/>without direct mechanical correlation between key and sounding string,<br/>still limited so far as a basic tuning. Pretty amusing that it seems<br/>suited mostly for straight strung instruments (Reed&apos;s only worked on the<br/>over strung bass strings), most specifically to a few unusual 19th<br/>century grands to minimize clatter and obstruction of, or holes in the<br/>soundboard.</p><p>The index of possible innovations for piano in the Center for New<br/>Musical Instruments brochure includes</p><p>Alternative keyboard design and modelling<br/>Acoustic piano<br/>Electroacoustic piano<br/>Hybrid piano<br/>Electrodynamic vibration drivers (Audioforte)<br/>Acoustic-electronic string-bar technology<br/>Fretted piano<br/>Real-time adaptive tuning<br/>Radical new piano design</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi/">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi/</a>&gt;</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3><a id=17944 href="#17944">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2001 5:17:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Clark wrote:]<br/>&gt;Golly!
