The gamelan section<br/>&gt;I liked most was the one just after the end of the story,<br/>&gt;before the closing song.  It had &apos;major&apos; sound, with a type<br/>&gt;of &apos;major 7th&apos; as part of the melody, but with some instruments<br/>&gt;adding a really funky &apos;neutral-tending-to minor 7th&apos; in some parts.</p><p>This concert was my first serious exposure to gamelan,<br/>which I&apos;ve heard on CD but never learned much about.<br/>It never really &apos;grabbed&apos; me before.</p><p>Perhaps those who know more about pelog and slendro can<br/>elucidate if this description &apos;rings any bells&apos;<br/>(&lt;groan...&gt; bad pun intended).</p><p>That mixing of the &apos;major 7th&apos; and the &apos;neutral/minor 7th&apos;<br/>(thrown in on a groovy syncopation or polymeter on an instrument<br/>with a flat bell-like timbre with a quick decay, kind of like<br/>a steel drum) will live on long in my aural memory.  As a person<br/>with an analytical bent, I&apos;d love to &apos;know&apos; (if I can reconstruct)<br/>what was going on there.</p><p>(maybe a gamelan list would be interested...)</p><p>-monz</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
