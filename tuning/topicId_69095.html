I thought it was exciting stuff, but of course neither of<br/>these are authentic.</p><p>Of the more authentic tunings, you can pick 12-et out by trying to<br/>choose the one that sounds the most boring. Unequal circulating<br/>temperaments sound generally pretty similar, but Werck3 seems to me<br/>to be something you can distinguish from the rest I tried--Brad&apos;s<br/>squiggle temperament, Valotti-Young, and Neidhardt1.</p><p>My conclusion from all of this is that Bach should be played on an<br/>organ with 31 equal temperament. It sounds good. If you want to use a<br/>historical circulating temperament instead, lots of choices will work<br/>but Werck3 is fine and has a bit more oomph than most, I think.</p><p>&gt; As for upper partials, like I said, we don&apos;t have to go realistic--a<br/>&gt; sawtooth timbre on a synth is great for upper partials, and they&apos;re<br/>&gt; perfectly harmonic like on a harpsichord.</p><p>I used a very large, high-quality organ font.</p></div>
