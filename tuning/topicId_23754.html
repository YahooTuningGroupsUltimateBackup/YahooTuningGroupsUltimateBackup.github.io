Was easy to do and turned out to be less than<br/>three megabytes, so easy to upload / download too.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to remember to do this more often.</p><p>Does have one &quot;bug&quot; - realised that if a post is entirely in html, rather<br/>than multi-part text / html, program doesn&apos;t convert the text to html.</p><p>I need to think how to do that when I get back to it. There are a few points<br/>involved that would need to be thought through.</p><p>Meanwhile, hopefully the few posts so far in this format are reasonably understandable<br/>even with all the tags in them. I imagine it may become a more<br/>common format in the future as more and more people go html in their use<br/>of e-mail - the early few thousand posts of the yahoo archives had no html parts for<br/>any of the messages (first message with an html part was from Kraig Grady,<br/>if anyone is interested to know).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
