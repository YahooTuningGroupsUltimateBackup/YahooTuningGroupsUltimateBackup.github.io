So I hope you&apos;ll pardon me if<br/>I still feel that I&apos;d only really &quot;have the context of<br/>anyone&apos;s writings&quot; if I could read the darned thing<br/>myself!  However, absent the time to learn and<br/>master the Greek of his day, the next-best thing<br/>must always be a good translation by a subject-<br/>matter expert who has those language skills I lack,<br/>and I&apos;m guessing that expert would be yourself.</p><p>So I will certainly write a proper study of that page<br/>on my to-do list.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, yes, the pythagoreans had already distinguished<br/>&gt; between the large and small semitones:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .. 2,3-monzo ...... ratio .......... ~cents ...... name<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .... [-11 7&gt; .... 2187 / 2048 .... 113.6850061 ... apotome<br/>&gt; .... [8 -5&gt; ...... 256 / 243 ...... 90.22499567 .. limma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact it was the pythagoreans who pointed out that<br/>&gt; the tone could not be equally divided into two identical<br/>&gt; semitones -- i&apos;ll bring this up again shortly ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos himself was the first music-theorist to<br/>&gt; break the chromatic genus (the one featuring semitones)<br/>&gt; into further subdivisions which he called &quot;shades&quot;,<br/>&gt; thus resulting in several other sizes of semitones:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (assuming my interpretation of Aristoxenos&apos;s tuning<br/>&gt; as 144-edo)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; chromatic shade ...... cent sizes of semitones<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... relaxed ............... 66 &amp; (2/3)<br/>&gt; ... hemiolic .............. 75<br/>&gt; ... tonic ................ 100</p><p>Which he used only in the chromatic genus?  Two wide<br/>tones, descending, followed by a relaxed shade, would<br/>certainly make an expressive tetrachord.</p><p>&gt; As i pointed out regarding Aristoxenos&apos;s use of the<br/>&gt; concept of string tension instead of length, he was<br/>&gt; deliberately distancing himself from the pythagoreans.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His description of &quot;tuning by concords&quot; can only be<br/>&gt; achieved by some form of temperament, and he impudently<br/>&gt; states that &quot;musicians know what a concord sounds like&quot;<br/>&gt; when he deliberately avoids using a ratio to measure one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it seems to me that when he speaks of a &quot;4th&quot; containing<br/>&gt; &quot;two and a half tones&quot;, he is again deliberately throwing<br/>&gt; sand in the face of the pythagoreans. IOW, regardless of<br/>&gt; what numerical complexities the pythagoreans weave in order<br/>&gt; to prove that there is no such thing as precisely 1/2-tone,<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos states that musicians deal with quasi-equal<br/>&gt; 1/2-tones as an established fact.</p><p>A very natural and reasonable thing to do, from<br/>a performer&apos;s point of view!</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a reasonable theory.  To it you might add<br/>&gt; &gt; that he found the previous attempts to quantify<br/>&gt; &gt; it unable to produce the sound of a concord that<br/>&gt; &gt; every musician recognised.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To the extent that pythagorean mathematics and the<br/>&gt; &quot;tuning by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th at<br/>&gt; the end of the procedure, that&apos;s true. But it also<br/>&gt; needs to be pointed out that the 144-edo tempered 4th<br/>&gt; is the familiar 12-edo one of 500 cents, which is a<br/>&gt; largely inaudible discrepancy from the ~498 cents of<br/>&gt; the pythagorean 4/3 ratio 4th.</p><p>The difference, 2 cents, is about the agreed<br/>limit of our ability to perceive.  However, I think<br/>your previous paragraph confuses the issue.  Let&apos;s<br/>disentangle the threads:<br/>1.  You agreed that the pythagorean maths produces<br/>a wolf-4th, which I was guessing Aristoxenos was<br/>objecting to.<br/>2.  You state, as justification for your theory that<br/>Aristoxenos meant 144-EDO, that its 4th is almost<br/>just, as far as our ears can tell.<br/>3.  But you also state that Aristoxenos&apos; &quot;tuning<br/>by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th!</p><p>Points 2. and 3. are not compatible; either the last<br/>4th is a wolf, or it isn&apos;t; if it&apos;s (almost) just, it isn&apos;t<br/>a wolf.</p><p>I&apos;m really going to have to read your page on<br/>Aristoxenos, aren&apos;t I?</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, a bias in favour of perception rather<br/>&gt; &gt; than measurement could also have lead him to<br/>&gt; &gt; ignore the difference in size of the two tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; and to use the term &quot;half a tone&quot; less precisely,<br/>&gt; &gt; to mean &quot;a part of a tone&quot;.  So that in writing of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;two and a half tones&quot; making the diatessaron,<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps he meant, from the starting note, &quot;one<br/>&gt; &gt; tone higher than that, then another, then part<br/>&gt; &gt; of another&quot;?  I&apos;m disinclined to see &quot;two and a<br/>&gt; &gt; half tones&quot; as meaning &quot;2.5 tones&quot;, unless we see<br/>&gt; &gt; him doing arithmetic with that number.  What do<br/>&gt; &gt; you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos was certainly dealing in approximations,<br/>&gt; as Partch so indignantly accused him of doing.</p><p>Good on him!  ... if that served his musical purposes<br/>well enough.  But then how would he be thinking of<br/>an unprecedentedly fine division of the fourth?</p><p>&gt; But apparently what&apos;s going on here is that Aristoxenos<br/>&gt; wanted to employ concepts derived from the then-new<br/>&gt; geometry expounded by Euclid. He saw Euclidean geometry<br/>&gt; as a way to measure divisions of irrational musical intervals,<br/>&gt; which the pythagorean mathematics before him were unable<br/>&gt; to deal with.</p><p>Now that is interesting!  And those geometric<br/>methods permit, in principle, of arbitrary accuracy<br/>of measurement - simply draw your diagrams large<br/>enough, and you get the number of decimal places<br/>you want.  Of course, there ARE practical limits.</p><p>But given that Aristoxenos was impressed by the<br/>mensurational powers of the new geometry, I&apos;m<br/>surprised you say he was dealing in approximations.</p><p>&gt; So i&apos;m not convinced that he intended his measurements<br/>&gt; to be as vague as they might seem to us moderns. Having<br/>&gt; thought about this for years, and done a lot of research<br/>&gt; into it, i&apos;m quite convinced that 144-edo is pretty much<br/>&gt; what Aristoxenos had in mind when writing his theories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (BTW, the character of Aristoxenos&apos;s two suriviving books<br/>&gt; seems to indicate that they were not written down by him,<br/>&gt; but that they are notes written down by students attending<br/>&gt; his lectures.)</p><p>Ouch!  But better than nothing.  I wonder if they<br/>were GOOD students?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note, however, that i don&apos;t agree with Partch that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aristoxenos deserves the credit (dubious credit, according<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to Partch) for being &quot;the father of temperament&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I speculated that the Sumerians, with their base-60<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics, ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (It occurred to me that this was perhaps a<br/>&gt; &gt; factor in Cleonides&apos; choice - dividing the<br/>&gt; &gt; classically perfect consonance, the diatessaron<br/>&gt; &gt; or fourth 4/3, into the classically perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; number of parts, 60, which the Greeks also<br/>&gt; &gt; inherited and perpetuated in geometry.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Sumerians, Babylonians, and Greeks were all quite<br/>&gt; fond of base-60 mathematics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... did have the ability to derive a very good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximation of 12-edo (or indeed any temperament)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as early as c.2500 BC -- and it has been satisfactorily<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; documented that the Greeks got a lot of their cultural<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and scientific knowledge from the Babylonians, who got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; theirs from the Sumerians.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumerian-tuning.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumerian-tuning.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tho the Greeks got much from the<br/>&gt; &gt; Babylonians, they built on it.  Did the<br/>&gt; &gt; Babylonians themselves invent nothing?  :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; The inheritors of the Greeks, the Arabs and<br/>&gt; &gt; other savants of early Islam, in their turn<br/>&gt; &gt; added much that he Greeks had not thought<br/>&gt; &gt; of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your assessment is pretty accurate. The Babylonians<br/>&gt; did add a few new twists, especially in mathematics,<br/>&gt; but culturally their legacy was basically that of<br/>&gt; adapting the Sumerian innovations to their own society.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The truth is that there have not been many Sumerian<br/>&gt; mathematical tablets deciphered and/or published.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the Babylonians retained the Sumerian logograms<br/>&gt; in their own words for the &quot;root&quot; concept of the word<br/>&gt; and added their own written symbols to represent the<br/>&gt; phonics of the Akkadian syllables -- very similar to<br/>&gt; the way modern Japanese writing retains the Chinese<br/>&gt; logograms and adds further symbols for the Japanese<br/>&gt; syllables.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So by stripping away the Akkadian syllables, as i have<br/>&gt; done on my webpage, one can see the underlying Sumerian<br/>&gt; basis of all of the Babylonian mathematical texts.<br/>&gt; And the essence of the math problems is already there<br/>&gt; in the Sumerian.</p><p>A very nice deduction!</p><p>I won&apos;t bother you further on this topic until<br/>I&apos;ve done at least the basic reading - your page.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.14.1/206 - Release Date: 16/12/05</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>SPONSORED LINKS</p><p>Music education<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+education&w1=Music+education&">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+education&w1=Music+education&</a><br/>w2=Music+production+education&amp;w3=Music+education+degree&amp;w4=Degree+educat<br/>ion+music+online&amp;w5=Music+business+education&amp;w6=Music+education+online&amp;c<br/>=6&amp;s=174&amp;.sig=zMNRfOOOdo7nVqxhYS_0Yg&gt;</p><p>Music production education<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+production+education&w1=Music">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+production+education&w1=Music</a><br/>+education&amp;w2=Music+production+education&amp;w3=Music+education+degree&amp;w4=De<br/>gree+education+music+online&amp;w5=Music+business+education&amp;w6=Music+educati<br/>on+online&amp;c=6&amp;s=174&amp;.sig=xvNPUlceIGAdVcjAsHH8JA&gt;</p><p>Music education degree<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+education+degree&w1=Music+edu">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+education+degree&w1=Music+edu</a><br/>cation&amp;w2=Music+production+education&amp;w3=Music+education+degree&amp;w4=Degree<br/>+education+music+online&amp;w5=Music+business+education&amp;w6=Music+education+o<br/>nline&amp;c=6&amp;s=174&amp;.sig=lrDYh_-yrdu524mpql-csg&gt;</p><p>Degree education music online<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Degree+education+music+online&w1=Mu">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Degree+education+music+online&w1=Mu</a><br/>sic+education&amp;w2=Music+production+education&amp;w3=Music+education+degree&amp;w4<br/>=Degree+education+music+online&amp;w5=Music+business+education&amp;w6=Music+educ<br/>ation+online&amp;c=6&amp;s=174&amp;.sig=SVm8lC0-Q2tryy6Hv14ihQ&gt;</p><p>Music business education<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+business+education&w1=Music+e">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+business+education&w1=Music+e</a><br/>ducation&amp;w2=Music+production+education&amp;w3=Music+education+degree&amp;w4=Degr<br/>ee+education+music+online&amp;w5=Music+business+education&amp;w6=Music+education<br/>+online&amp;c=6&amp;s=174&amp;.sig=pCxzd_uR0dRaYO3MB1Fpvw&gt;</p><p>Music education online<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+education+online&w1=Music+edu">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Music+education+online&w1=Music+edu</a><br/>cation&amp;w2=Music+production+education&amp;w3=Music+education+degree&amp;w4=Degree<br/>+education+music+online&amp;w5=Music+business+education&amp;w6=Music+education+o<br/>nline&amp;c=6&amp;s=174&amp;.sig=DaqBb8P8ErSmB8MxxA-ePw&gt;</p><p>________________________________</p><p>YAHOO!

However, absent the time to learn and<br/>&gt; master the Greek of his day, the next-best thing<br/>&gt; must always be a good translation by a subject-<br/>&gt; matter expert who has those language skills I lack,<br/>&gt; and I&apos;m guessing that expert would be yourself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I will certainly write a proper study of that page<br/>&gt; on my to-do list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, yes, the pythagoreans had already distinguished<br/>&gt; &gt; between the large and small semitones:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; .. 2,3-monzo ...... ratio .......... ~cents ...... name<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; .... [-11 7&gt; .... 2187 / 2048 .... 113.6850061 ... apotome<br/>&gt; &gt; .... [8 -5&gt; ...... 256 / 243 ...... 90.22499567 .. limma<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In fact it was the pythagoreans who pointed out that<br/>&gt; &gt; the tone could not be equally divided into two identical<br/>&gt; &gt; semitones -- i&apos;ll bring this up again shortly ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Aristoxenos himself was the first music-theorist to<br/>&gt; &gt; break the chromatic genus (the one featuring semitones)<br/>&gt; &gt; into further subdivisions which he called &quot;shades&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; thus resulting in several other sizes of semitones:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (assuming my interpretation of Aristoxenos&apos;s tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; as 144-edo)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; chromatic shade ...... cent sizes of semitones<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... relaxed ............... 66 &amp; (2/3)<br/>&gt; &gt; ... hemiolic .............. 75<br/>&gt; &gt; ... tonic ................ 100<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which he used only in the chromatic genus?  Two wide<br/>&gt; tones, descending, followed by a relaxed shade, would<br/>&gt; certainly make an expressive tetrachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As i pointed out regarding Aristoxenos&apos;s use of the<br/>&gt; &gt; concept of string tension instead of length, he was<br/>&gt; &gt; deliberately distancing himself from the pythagoreans.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; His description of &quot;tuning by concords&quot; can only be<br/>&gt; &gt; achieved by some form of temperament, and he impudently<br/>&gt; &gt; states that &quot;musicians know what a concord sounds like&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; when he deliberately avoids using a ratio to measure one.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So it seems to me that when he speaks of a &quot;4th&quot; containing<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;two and a half tones&quot;, he is again deliberately throwing<br/>&gt; &gt; sand in the face of the pythagoreans. IOW, regardless of<br/>&gt; &gt; what numerical complexities the pythagoreans weave in order<br/>&gt; &gt; to prove that there is no such thing as precisely 1/2-tone,<br/>&gt; &gt; Aristoxenos states that musicians deal with quasi-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/2-tones as an established fact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very natural and reasonable thing to do, from<br/>&gt; a performer&apos;s point of view!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s a reasonable theory.  To it you might add<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that he found the previous attempts to quantify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it unable to produce the sound of a concord that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; every musician recognised.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To the extent that pythagorean mathematics and the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;tuning by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th at<br/>&gt; &gt; the end of the procedure, that&apos;s true. But it also<br/>&gt; &gt; needs to be pointed out that the 144-edo tempered 4th<br/>&gt; &gt; is the familiar 12-edo one of 500 cents, which is a<br/>&gt; &gt; largely inaudible discrepancy from the ~498 cents of<br/>&gt; &gt; the pythagorean 4/3 ratio 4th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference, 2 cents, is about the agreed<br/>&gt; limit of our ability to perceive.  However, I think<br/>&gt; your previous paragraph confuses the issue.  Let&apos;s<br/>&gt; disentangle the threads:<br/>&gt; 1.  You agreed that the pythagorean maths produces<br/>&gt; a wolf-4th, which I was guessing Aristoxenos was<br/>&gt; objecting to.<br/>&gt; 2.  You state, as justification for your theory that<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos meant 144-EDO, that its 4th is almost<br/>&gt; just, as far as our ears can tell.<br/>&gt; 3.  But you also state that Aristoxenos&apos; &quot;tuning<br/>&gt; by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Points 2. and 3. are not compatible; either the last<br/>&gt; 4th is a wolf, or it isn&apos;t; if it&apos;s (almost) just, it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; a wolf.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m really going to have to read your page on<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos, aren&apos;t I?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, a bias in favour of perception rather<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; than measurement could also have lead him to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ignore the difference in size of the two tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and to use the term &quot;half a tone&quot; less precisely,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to mean &quot;a part of a tone&quot;.  So that in writing of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;two and a half tones&quot; making the diatessaron,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps he meant, from the starting note, &quot;one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tone higher than that, then another, then part<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of another&quot;?  I&apos;m disinclined to see &quot;two and a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; half tones&quot; as meaning &quot;2.5 tones&quot;, unless we see<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; him doing arithmetic with that number.  What do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you think?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Aristoxenos was certainly dealing in approximations,<br/>&gt; &gt; as Partch so indignantly accused him of doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good on him!  ... if that served his musical purposes<br/>&gt; well enough.  But then how would he be thinking of<br/>&gt; an unprecedentedly fine division of the fourth?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But apparently what&apos;s going on here is that Aristoxenos<br/>&gt; &gt; wanted to employ concepts derived from the then-new<br/>&gt; &gt; geometry expounded by Euclid. He saw Euclidean geometry<br/>&gt; &gt; as a way to measure divisions of irrational musical intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt; which the pythagorean mathematics before him were unable<br/>&gt; &gt; to deal with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that is interesting!  And those geometric<br/>&gt; methods permit, in principle, of arbitrary accuracy<br/>&gt; of measurement - simply draw your diagrams large<br/>&gt; enough, and you get the number of decimal places<br/>&gt; you want.  Of course, there ARE practical limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But given that Aristoxenos was impressed by the<br/>&gt; mensurational powers of the new geometry, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; surprised you say he was dealing in approximations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So i&apos;m not convinced that he intended his measurements<br/>&gt; &gt; to be as vague as they might seem to us moderns. Having<br/>&gt; &gt; thought about this for years, and done a lot of research<br/>&gt; &gt; into it, i&apos;m quite convinced that 144-edo is pretty much<br/>&gt; &gt; what Aristoxenos had in mind when writing his theories.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (BTW, the character of Aristoxenos&apos;s two suriviving books<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to indicate that they were not written down by him,<br/>&gt; &gt; but that they are notes written down by students attending<br/>&gt; &gt; his lectures.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ouch!  But better than nothing.  I wonder if they<br/>&gt; were GOOD students?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note, however, that i don&apos;t agree with Partch that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aristoxenos deserves the credit (dubious credit, according<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Partch) for being &quot;the father of temperament&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I speculated that the Sumerians, with their base-60<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics, ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (It occurred to me that this was perhaps a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; factor in Cleonides&apos; choice - dividing the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; classically perfect consonance, the diatessaron<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or fourth 4/3, into the classically perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; number of parts, 60, which the Greeks also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; inherited and perpetuated in geometry.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Sumerians, Babylonians, and Greeks were all quite<br/>&gt; &gt; fond of base-60 mathematics.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ... did have the ability to derive a very good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approximation of 12-edo (or indeed any temperament)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as early as c.2500 BC -- and it has been satisfactorily<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; documented that the Greeks got a lot of their cultural<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and scientific knowledge from the Babylonians, who got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theirs from the Sumerians.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumerian-">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumerian-</a><br/>tuning.htm<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Tho the Greeks got much from the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Babylonians, they built on it.  Did the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Babylonians themselves invent nothing?  :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The inheritors of the Greeks, the Arabs and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other savants of early Islam, in their turn<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; added much that he Greeks had not thought<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Your assessment is pretty accurate. The Babylonians<br/>&gt; &gt; did add a few new twists, especially in mathematics,<br/>&gt; &gt; but culturally their legacy was basically that of<br/>&gt; &gt; adapting the Sumerian innovations to their own society.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The truth is that there have not been many Sumerian<br/>&gt; &gt; mathematical tablets deciphered and/or published.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But the Babylonians retained the Sumerian logograms<br/>&gt; &gt; in their own words for the &quot;root&quot; concept of the word<br/>&gt; &gt; and added their own written symbols to represent the<br/>&gt; &gt; phonics of the Akkadian syllables -- very similar to<br/>&gt; &gt; the way modern Japanese writing retains the Chinese<br/>&gt; &gt; logograms and adds further symbols for the Japanese<br/>&gt; &gt; syllables.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So by stripping away the Akkadian syllables, as i have<br/>&gt; &gt; done on my webpage, one can see the underlying Sumerian<br/>&gt; &gt; basis of all of the Babylonian mathematical texts.<br/>&gt; &gt; And the essence of the math problems is already there<br/>&gt; &gt; in the Sumerian.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very nice deduction!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t bother you further on this topic until<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve done at least the basic reading - your page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;
