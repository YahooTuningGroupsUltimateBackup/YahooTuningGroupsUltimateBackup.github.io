I had a lot of fun writing the thesis though, especially<br/>the tuning part, so I hope it&apos;s fun to read.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Adaptive tuning (the &quot;unstable solution&quot;)</p><p>&gt;Wow, not a term I&apos;d use for adaptive tuning!  I let the different needs<br/>&gt;fight it out till they reach a stable solution.  Stable, perhaps I should &gt;say, in an axis of time that is perpendicular to that in which the piece is &gt;played.  In the normal time axis, &quot;unstable&quot; makes sense.</p><p>Hoho---orthogonal timelines confuse me.  I used the term &quot;unstable&quot;<br/>because &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; wasn&apos;t commonly used when I wrote it.<br/>What I meant was this:  in the &quot;stable&quot; solution, the pitches of the<br/>scalar degrees never change for any reason; the scale is tuned before<br/>we start playing (i.e., making the assumption that all the degrees are<br/>going to be sounding at once).  In the &quot;unstable&quot; solution, different<br/>appearances of a scalar degree can be tuned differently, according to<br/>what degrees are sounding (i.e., according to their &quot;harmonic context&quot;).<br/>In that sense, the tuning is &quot;unstable&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;runs from pp 92--125.<br/>&gt;&gt;It has three main sections.

After that<br/>you might next choose notes from neighboring harmonic contexts.  After<br/>that, there are a number of other possibilities.  Anyway, once a harmonic<br/>context has an anchor, its members get tuned according to the usual<br/>method for the stable solution---so it&apos;s like each harmonic context is a<br/>miniature scale which needs to be tuned.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It also includes methods for determining the extent to which a note is &gt;&gt;present (they can extend into neighboring HCs<br/>&gt;&gt;via articulation, reverberation, memory, etc.) and methods for<br/>&gt;&gt;assigning various parameters to notes.</p><p>&gt;Do you loudness-weight your consideration?</p><p>Yes, there&apos;s a parameter for that.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Pages 106--124 present the<br/>&gt;&gt;main part of the algorithm---the problem is to find anchors for each HC &gt;&gt;amongst its member pitches.
