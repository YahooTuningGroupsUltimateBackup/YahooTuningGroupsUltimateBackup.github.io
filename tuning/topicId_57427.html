In<br/>this lattice therefore 9 has the same distance from the unison as 5,7,<br/>and 11, and so of course 3 has half of that distance. If we use this<br/>metric, and draw hyperspheres around the center point I gave above, we<br/>find we first touch a &quot;shell&quot; of six intervals equidistant from the<br/>center, {45, 63, 99, 105, 165, 231}. Three of these are of the form<br/>9*p, where p is 5,7, or 11, and the other three are of the form<br/>3*p*q, where p and q are distinct primes from 5,7, and 11. Then we hit<br/>a second shell, consisting of twelve more points, which gives us<br/>{15, 21, 33, 35, 55, 77, 135, 189, 297, 315, 495, 693}. This consists<br/>of 3*p, 27*p, 9*p*q, and p*q tones. Thirdly we hit a shell consisting<br/>of just two tones, 27 and 385. We can keep on adding as many shells as<br/>we like, but stopping here gives the eikosany.</p><p>There are many more ball scales than these, of course, and<br/>noneuclidean metrics, such as the Hahn metric which has been discussed<br/>on the tuning-math list, add to the possibilities. It is also possible<br/>to do balls of chords, rather than of notes directly. By seeing that<br/>the hexany, p-limit diamond, and eikosany are balls we put them in<br/>this broader context.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2005 1:01:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kraig,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is hard to guess how Partch came up with the diamond,<br/>&gt; except that Forester attributes it to Meyer triadic diamond<br/>&gt; diagram ( see his site)</p><p>this question has come up here before, and i&apos;ve addressed it:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/43120">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/43120</a></p><p>there&apos;s is no doubt in my mind at all that Partch adapted<br/>Meyer&apos;s diagram, to create the tonality diamond.

Unless there is a copy somewhere else , it is pretty hard to imagine how Partch could have gotten it from Novaro. I know of no one claiming otherwise<br/> On the question of Meyer and Partch though.<br/>Could we not say that Meyer just took the Lambdoma of Nicomachis<br/>and applied the 3 limit consonant structure to a 5 limit one.<br/>Possibly Partch saw Meyer work  in the same light. he was after all a greek revivalist<br/>and it is to this that he regresses in order to start anew<br/>&lt;&gt; Partch did more than just taking the diamond out to 11 limit, he filled in the blanks that made up a 41 tone scale with two alternates.<br/>Partch in other words made a musically viable tuning  that included the dianmond, but that was not all of it.</p><p>In a sense it is an example of an MOS created by the mans ear and musical instinct.<br/>Meyer exibited no understanding of his triadic diamond in the context of a linear scale or what it would take to make it musically useful.</p><p>yes, i understand that from a mathematical point of view<br/>there&apos;s nothing special which differentiates Meyer&apos;s diamond<br/>from Partch&apos;s.</p><p>my point is adressing the historical question of where<br/>Partch got the idea for the diamond ... it didn&apos;t just<br/>spring from his mind spontaneously -- it was inspired by<br/>Partch&apos;s knowledge of Meyer&apos;s book, which is abundantly<br/>cited in Partch&apos;s own book.</p><p>i pointed this out because there is speculation that<br/>Partch may have gotten the idea from Novaro, but i haven&apos;t<br/>read Novaro&apos;s works in detail and don&apos;t know how well<br/>acquainted Partch was with them. but i know for sure that<br/>he had read Meyer.</p><p>-monz</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2005 2:25:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kraig,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On the question of Meyer and Partch though.<br/>&gt; Could we not say that Meyer just took the Lambdoma of<br/>&gt; Nicomachis  and applied the 3 limit consonant structure<br/>&gt; to a 5 limit one.
