With different elements such as rhythm and orchestration composers like Stravinsky did the same,<br/>selecting and working out procedures to the highest degree of refinement. It sometimes comes as a surprise to many that artists and composers can and indeed at times have to<br/>be thrawn narrow minded bigots in matters of what goes in and what stays out.

Anyway, when I think of 612 or 1547 I think of exactly those amounts of tones which are impractical for acoustic instruments, which is what I mean by practical context. I have the impression that there are others on this list who think the same.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s perhaps where the misunderstanding arises . You&apos;re obviously referring to subsets and I&apos;m not up to speed on the tuning mathematics discussions, mainly because I don&apos;t understand them. In fact these last few heated posts from your good self have been the first of yours that I&apos;ve ever understood, but that&apos;s for me to sort out.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
