Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2000 1:21:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There was some discussion by John Chalmers and others a while ago about<br/>multidimensional continued fractions (such as ternary continued fractions)<br/>in the context of approximating a set of JI intervals with an ET.<br/>Multidimensional continued fractions could also be useful in approximating<br/>an irrational chord with JI. I was thinking that, since for dyads the Farey<br/>mediants could probably be derived by using an appropriately truncated<br/>continued fraction expansion for every interval in the continuum, perhaps<br/>the triadic harmonic entropy problem could be approached with a similar<br/>approach. Discouragingly, I found the following website:<br/><a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/NEWS/continued-fractions">http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/NEWS/continued-fractions</a><br/>which says,<br/>&quot;Alas, it turns out that in higher dimensions there are MANY competing<br/>algorithms, all equally disappointing ;)&quot;<br/>although my particular problem might escape these disappointments. Anyone<br/>know anything about the Jacobi-Perron algorithm? Or if any of the algorithms<br/>discussed by Barbour might be appropriate?</p></div>
