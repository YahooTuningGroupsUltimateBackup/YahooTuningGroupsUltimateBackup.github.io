I was thinking that, since for dyads the Farey<br/>mediants could probably be derived by using an appropriately truncated<br/>continued fraction expansion for every interval in the continuum, perhaps<br/>the triadic harmonic entropy problem could be approached with a similar<br/>approach. Discouragingly, I found the following website:<br/><a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/NEWS/continued-fractions">http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/NEWS/continued-fractions</a><br/>which says,<br/>&quot;Alas, it turns out that in higher dimensions there are MANY competing<br/>algorithms, all equally disappointing ;)&quot;<br/>although my particular problem might escape these disappointments. Anyone<br/>know anything about the Jacobi-Perron algorithm? Or if any of the algorithms<br/>discussed by Barbour might be appropriate?</p></div>
