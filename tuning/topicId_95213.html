I filed in tuning a full description of how I obtained these intonations which are much better than those of 12TET. Plots of all major and minor triads when compared to tempered responses showed the superiority of the Piagui chord harmony and these plots were filed too. It was not necessary to add overtones to each sinusoidal chord component to insert the timbre so pure sinusoids produced aesthetic Piagui responses while the equal tempered chords showed chaotic information.</p><p>Merry Christmas.</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>December 24, 2010</p><p>__________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 5690 (20101209) __________</p><p>ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p><a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p></div>
