There are scads of &quot;performing musicians&quot; that<br/>&gt; make a living that not only don&apos;t hear acutely, but couldn&apos;t find an<br/>&gt; A=440 with a geiger counter!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is funny to &quot;hear&quot; you say this.  All along, Carl was hinting that since<br/>you are a percussionist, all you do is hit things.  Prefabricated pitched<br/>instruments, or electronics, could be played by a deaf person.  If fact,<br/>there is a famous deaf Irish women percussionist playing with orchestras all<br/>over the world.  Of course, there is timpani tuning, for which one must at<br/>least match pitch.  But I have no doubt about your abilities.  My friend,<br/>pianist Joshua Pierce, can hear anything even though he has never tuned a<br/>piano.  He even did a few lines in our performances of &quot;US Highball.&quot;  And<br/>I&apos;m sure you, and others pro musicians studied years of ear training,<br/>including solfege, dictation, keyboard harmony, and through private<br/>instruction.</p><p>My statement connecting performing musicians with acuity of pitch is like<br/>saying performing (better in both case &quot;professional&quot;) basketball players are<br/>tall.  It is only a general statement that someone that has an easier time<br/>with pitch would be in the most ideal place to perform professionally on<br/>flexibly-pitched instruments.</p><p>Jon, if you are suffering hacks that can&apos;t match pitch in professional<br/>situations, I can only extend my sympathies.  Geiger counter....good one!</p><p>Cheers, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2002 12:29:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; It is funny to &quot;hear&quot; you say this.</p><p>You specifically asked Carl if he thought people could be active as musicians without some innate ear-sense.
