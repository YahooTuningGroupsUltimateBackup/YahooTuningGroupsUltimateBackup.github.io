Thankyou for translating my figures to ratios and<br/>their descriptions for those who are more used to this sort of<br/>presentation. Middle eastern, Indian, European and Asian music<br/>traditions have certain expectations about what should be included in<br/>a comprehensive temperament. The seven chords which I listed are<br/>probably the minimum requirements and 41tet is a good choice for a<br/>working system which can act as a level playing field for all the<br/>different musicians around the world. This is not to say that I am<br/>against other microtonal activities. I am quite in favour of having<br/>1200tet as the scientific standard (rounded to the nearest cent).<br/>Every temperament was designed by someone. I am trying to demystify<br/>the process so that some members can feel confident in designing<br/>their own. One way of analysing a temperament is to divide it into<br/>three parts ie. (F-C-G-D) and (A-E-B-F#) and (C#-Ab-Eb-Bb) and<br/>examine the numerical relationships according to certain criteria.<br/>What criteria? Whatever the designer thinks is important.</p></div>
