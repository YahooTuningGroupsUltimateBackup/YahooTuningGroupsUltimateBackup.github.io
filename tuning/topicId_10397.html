<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>New CD and website</h1><h3>Peter &#x3C;PETER.BLASSER@OBERLIN.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2000 3:15:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;d like to announce the opening of a new site and CD at<br/><a href="http://www.elyrialights.com">www.elyrialights.com</a>.<br/>The music is all in 22 tone equal temperament, and stylistically is a blend<br/>of country, electronic, and rock.  You can hear for yourself; the site has<br/>a lot of mpegs from the cd, from live concerts, and from b side recordings.<br/>So please visit it.  It&apos;s the fist time I&apos;ve been on major booksellers&apos;<br/>lists.  Although I&apos;ve sold a lot locally, I would like to also reach<br/>communities with similar interests, especially the tuning community.</p><p>Pardon me if the site is still a little under construction in the &quot;redlight<br/>band&quot; section.  It won&apos;t be under construction for long.  I will probably<br/>also be posting more theoretical information on how I used 22 tone equal<br/>temperament, as time passes.</p><p>-Peter Blasser</p><p><a href="http://www.elyrialights.com">http://www.elyrialights.com</a>          (elyria lights)</p><p><a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/~pblasser">http://www.oberlin.edu/~pblasser</a>     (previous music)</p></div>
