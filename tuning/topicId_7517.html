The &quot;Decatonic<br/>&gt;Waltz&quot; I performed at the Microthon falls right out of it.</p><p>So I went once again to check out the paper (still doesn&apos;t want to download<br/>or view as a .pdf, and the html page came up with some of the images<br/>missing...). In the paper you state:</p><p>&gt;The symmetrical scale is useful as a basis for a keyboard mapping of<br/>&gt;22-equal. To wit: leaving every &quot;E&quot; on the standard keyboard out of the<br/>&gt;mapping gives two keyboard octaves to one acoustical octave. The black<br/>&gt;keys then form a maximally even scale</p><p>...which isn&apos;t exactly what I was looking for. The Diamond Marimba is both<br/>the physical and aural manifestation of the Tonality Diamond. With a<br/>standardized black/white kbd, you have to first ask to &apos;ignore&apos; the &quot;E&quot;<br/>keys (even though they are plainly there), and then there are issues of<br/>whether something that is &quot;maximally even&quot; should be represented by groups<br/>of 2&apos;s and 3&apos;s (the black key groupings).</p><p>I&apos;m really looking for as close to a one-to-one correlation as possible,<br/>which this scenario is not.

So those findings<br/>aren&apos;t applicable to MIDI keyboards, let alone when they have more than 12<br/>keys to the octave.  Steve rebuilt a MIDI keyboard, not a piano.</p><p>My old PSR keyboard has white keys 1.8 cm center-center.  I found that<br/>playable, but not convenient.  A Rezsutek octave with this spacing would<br/>be 21.6 cm, plus the width of the key.  Playable melodically, but I<br/>wouldn&apos;t be able to hold an octave with one hand.  Someone with larger<br/>hands would, but would also have more trouble with the keys being small.<br/>Unfortunately, the spacing of a rebuilt keyboard would be greater than<br/>this, as it&apos;s the chromatic spacing that&apos;s the limiting factor.  I make it<br/>a 26cm octave (counting 23 keys).</p><p>When you say &quot;getting stuck between the blacks&quot; does that mean you&apos;re<br/>deliberately playing the top end of the white notes?  This is possible<br/>with mini-keys, but not easy.  I&apos;d prefer to write music that doesn&apos;t<br/>require such tricks.  With a custom-built keyboard, the blacks could be<br/>thickened, and the keyboard made playable with a smaller span.  But then a<br/>custom-built keyboard could have more than two ranks.</p><p>Like I said, I haven&apos;t tried this with a MIDI keyboard, and so can&apos;t be<br/>sure how it would work with an extended mapping.  Also, the keyboard I&apos;ve<br/>used isn&apos;t velocity sensitive.</p><p>&gt; Two hands, eh?  Why didn&apos;t I think of that!  Who needs four-part<br/>&gt; harmony, anyway!</p><p>Well, you may prefer playing against a drone, but the chords are there if<br/>you want them.  I can play progressions of 4-note chords with 29 notes to<br/>the octave, it shouldn&apos;t be too difficult with 29.</p><p>&gt; (There&apos;s no doubt that a helluva lot could be done on a<br/>&gt; no-octave-reaching keyboard.  There&apos;s also no doubt that a helluva lot<br/>&gt; _couldn&apos;t_ be done.)</p><p>That&apos;s better, you&apos;re not talking about pre-requisites for &quot;any serious<br/>xen keyboard&quot; any more.</p></div><h3>Clark &#x3C;caccola@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2000 3:33:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:</p><p>&gt;   [...]your design [...] seems absolutely unnavigable beyond one or two<br/>&gt;   &quot;keys&quot; -- diatonic ones which don&apos;t even work in 22-tET.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Fair enough.

You could spend your life playing wonderful music on a xen<br/>keyboard where you could only reach a 5/3.  But I wouldn&apos;t call it a<br/>serious alternative to the Halberstadt-12 keyboard, considering the types<br/>of voicings you&apos;d be giving up.  I wouldn&apos;t pay money for a full-sized<br/>Halberstadt anymore either, after playing various scaled-down versions over<br/>at DS.
