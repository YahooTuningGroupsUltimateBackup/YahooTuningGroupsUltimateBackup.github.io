Will be nice to see and hear some real acoustic microtonal<br/>instruments, and ones designed to play microtonal scales.</p><p>&gt; would need to be<br/>&gt; built or modified and players/singers trained but till that happens good<br/>&gt; sampler/midi realisations<br/>&gt; would be a start. That&apos;s a starting point for collaborations.</p><p>Have to start somewhere.</p><p>&gt; The educational angle is a strong one in Scotland and  I think it would be most<br/>&gt; beneficial for<br/>&gt; schools and university composition departments to have visiting<br/>&gt; speakers/demonstrators show some<br/>&gt; of the possibilities of non-12 music. First some sort of profile would have to<br/>&gt; be established, to<br/>&gt; get the credibility in the first place.

Another<br/>&gt; option would be to build a UK microtonal site and keep it alive with streamed<br/>&gt; audio, scores and<br/>&gt; theoretical issues. If it was publicised around the right places it should<br/>&gt; arouses some interest.<br/>....<br/>&gt; It strikes me that the theorists are way ahead of the game and that a well<br/>&gt; presented paper on the<br/>&gt; Miracle and related tunings with electronic or midi pieces would be a sound<br/>&gt; start. This could be<br/>&gt; done in a reasonably short time span given sympathetic music institutions.<br/>&gt; Perhaps if a UK<br/>&gt; microtonal website was up and running concurrently, interest would grow and<br/>&gt; we&apos;d get the critical<br/>&gt; mass for an event.</p><p>Yes, and I imagine a nice web site could help with &quot;respectability&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m considering approaching Edinburgh University formally but it needs to be<br/>&gt; done carefully.
