Recently, I&apos;ve found a 5-limit 2D tuning which tempers out 273375/262144 (or about 72 cents). The generator is strikingly close to 25/18. But according to the mapping, 25/18 requires 20 generators, not 1. But the similarity is so clear that I couldn&apos;t help using it like that while experimenting with it on my keyboard. A few moments later, I realized I was unintentionally often approximating 5/3 with -9 generators rather than +10. And that all is because 19 generators are very close to 9 octaves. But if it really is like that, isn&apos;t it actually better to take the simple 19-EDO and map the approximants with just one step size instead of two? I doubt that this 2D version could have any use for actual music. To be honest, this is the first time ever that I consider a 2D tuning useless even though there is no strong mistuning there. And who knows if I&apos;m going to say that later about something else ... Well, I&apos;m just &quot;pondering&quot;.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
