So perhaps a good trade-off of playability vs #-of-notes-per-octave?</p><p>I like this idea a lot! It&apos;s very clever, and demonstrates a strength<br/>of the Halberstadt layout that I think should be explored more. It<br/>generalizes the Halberstadt layout to the 12+7 MOS structure instead<br/>of the 7+5 MOS structure. I haven&apos;t ever heard of this idea, but it<br/>sounds like a great point of departure for a different kind of<br/>generalized keyboard layout, and one perhaps that keyboard players<br/>might intuitively gravitate to.</p><p>What would be ridiculously awesome is to come up with a simple method<br/>of cascading layers of keys to fit different MOS structures. That is,<br/>7-tet could be 5 white keys and 2 black keys, and then 12-tet could be<br/>the 7-tet layout plus an additional 5 &quot;red&quot; keys let&apos;s say, and then<br/>19-tet could be the 12-tet layout plus an additional 7 &quot;blue&quot; keys.</p><p>This process could continue forever, but one could arbitrarily cut it<br/>off by defining a subset of the MOS heirarchy to use. So if you&apos;re<br/>designing the layout around meantone, you could say that you&apos;re only<br/>going to set up the keyboard to handle meantone[7] as a primary layer<br/>and meantone[5] as a secondary layer, and hence limit yourself to<br/>meantone[5, 7] - Halberstadt. Or, as per your idea, you could set the<br/>keyboard up to handle meantone[12] as a primary layer, and meantone[7]<br/>as a secondary layer, and limit yourself to meantone[7, 12] - the<br/>&quot;Kiteg&quot; layout. The Goldstein layout would be if you set mavila[9] up<br/>as a primary layer, and mavila[7] up as a secondary layer.</p><p>And if we could devise a way to come up with a way to geometrically<br/>pack multiple layers of keys together - an irregular tesselation of<br/>the 2d plane, if you will - then we&apos;d have a great approach to<br/>generalizing the Halberstadt layout that would probably become my<br/>favorite alternative keyboard layout ever. We could set 19-tet up as<br/>having a primary layer of 7, a secondary layer of 5, a tertiary layer<br/>of 3, and a quaternary layout of 2, or something.</p><p>Anyone heard of anything like this?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=94869 href="#94869">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2010 4:27:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Nov 26, 2010 at 7:20 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; We could set 19-tet up as<br/>&gt; having a primary layer of 7, a secondary layer of 5, a tertiary layer<br/>&gt; of 3, and a quaternary layout of 2, or something.</p><p>This of course adds up to 17.

It makes me think of Yasser, and his theory that music is evolving toward a 12-note diatonic scale.  For that kind of approach, it&apos;s quite practical!</p><p>However, the interesting challenge of 19-EDO is that it has multiple MOS scales that are rich enough in concordant triads to serve as a basis for a tonality.  My particular fave is the 4L+5s scale (in the LLsLsLsLs mode), once known as &quot;hemifourths&quot; because it&apos;s based on the ~250-cent generator.  There&apos;s also the 10-note 9L+1s scale (in the LLLLsLLLL mode), as well as a few others that I haven&apos;t found too enticing.  So the question in designing a layout is, which scale do you want to focus on?  The 10-note 9L+1s scale has the most compact layout (simply 10 white and 9 black), but it makes other scales look like nonsense.  The hemifourths scale is tough, because the large step is 3 degrees of 19-EDO and the small step is 1, so you&apos;d need split-and-doubled black keys (or something similarly impractical).  The layout you suggest is actually pretty good for hemifourths, provided you interpret it in reference to diatonic note-spellings.  I don&apos;t really know which one is really overall the most versatile and ergonomic, and I&apos;m really more of a guitarist than a keyboardist.  But I&apos;m really lovin&apos; on 19 right now and I suspect it&apos;s the easiest alternative EDO for me to talk other musicians into playing around with, so I&apos;d really love to know if anyone&apos;s attempted 19 on a converted halberstadt-like keyboard design.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kiteg&quot; &lt;kiteg@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regarding 19 notes/octave keyboards: From what I&apos;ve read, most people take the approach of splitting the standard black keys in half, either right/left or front/back, and adding 2 more black keys.

Yeah, it&apos;s an intriguing, even ingenious idea, but Joseph Yasser had the idea before you. It&apos;s in his Theory of Evolving Tonality. The result would make the octave too wide for easy playability however, as you say.</p><p>I have tried myself to come up with a really playable 19-tone keyboard, but have never had much luck. Probably the old horizontally split accidental concept is the best, altho I think that a double manual would be advisable, so that chords playable only on  accidentals could be manipulated without breaking your fingers.</p><p>There is a Mr Wraight who makes 19-tone harpsichords I believe. There&apos;s a photo of one of them on the net.</p><p>Soon after the invention of the 1/3 comma meantone in 16th century Italy, people started making 19-tone keyboards to try it out. Zarlino, Praetorius, Titelouze and above all Costeley are associated with such keyboards. Costeley tells us in no uncertain terms that he used 1/3 comma meantone on his 19-tone keyboard. And Mersenne informs us that Titelouze used the same tuning. Apparently the design used was always much the same; either splitting the accidentals horizontally or vertically.</p><p>Someone more up on generalized keyboards than I am could probably suggest something really fine. But considering that Yamaha has actually tried to PATENT the old Renaissance design, maybe people  would prefer to keep any really good design a SECRET.</p></div><h3><a id=94876 href="#94876">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2010 6:17:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; Man, I had to do some editing of this into a text editor to<br/>&gt; make the Ascii line up right, it displays quite messily with<br/>&gt; a monospace font if additional spaces aren&apos;t added.</p><p>Tried this link?</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_94867.html#94867?var=0&l=1">/tuning/topicId_94867.html#94867?var=0&l=1</a></p><p>&gt; Anyway, once I&apos;d got it straightened out, I realized I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; thought about this layout before for 19 before.

So, for 19, you might have 12+7 = 19. Then take the continued fraction convergents for 7/12, with penultimate convergent 3/5. Now take the ratio of numerators and compare to the ratio of denominators: 5/12 &lt; 3/7. Fill in the mediant: (5+3)/(12+7) = 8/19. The 12 note MOS using the 8/19 generator gives you your white keys, and the 7 note MOS filling out the circle using the 8/19 generator gives the black keys.

Yes, it would<br/>lead to multiple layouts for each tuning - you could build a 22 layout<br/>off of superpyth diatonic, or porcupine[8], or pajara (or the SPM<br/>scales), etc.</p><p>&gt; The whole numbers are 22-ET degrees, with pajara members<br/>&gt; in red. The letters are decatonic pitch classes on the<br/>&gt; keys I think you&apos;d usually finger an ascending run.<br/>&gt; The ratios show the shapes of the major and minor tetrads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would probably mirror this for the left hand (i.e. pitch<br/>&gt; descending from the middle to the left) in the 7 blank<br/>&gt; columns there. Probably better would be two AXeS in the<br/>&gt; vertical orientation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The criteria I used for this are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. fingering of major and minor tetrads be as similar<br/>&gt; as possible<br/>&gt; 2. root-position pitches for these fall as close as possible<br/>&gt; on a semicircle of radius 2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I dunno if it&apos;s optimal for these but it&apos;s what I came up<br/>&gt; with just now.</p><p>That&apos;s a new paradigm for me, although I could probably get used to<br/>it. The fact that you naturally put 6/5 right below 5/4 (vertically)<br/>and 12/7 right below 7/4 suggests that the vertical axis -&gt; pitch<br/>height cue is fairly intuitive for you, and the fact that you set the<br/>upper notes of the chord to increase in pitch to the right suggests<br/>that the horizontal axis -&gt; pitch height cue is also just as intuitive<br/>(unless you mirror it on the other hand, in which case it&apos;s replaced<br/>by a thumb to pinky axis -&gt; pitch height cue).</p><p>To me, cues like that are more important than transpositional<br/>invariance, unless the layout also preserves most of those cues (e.g.<br/>Bosanquet/Fokker). But I guess it depends on if you&apos;re focusing more<br/>on harmonic relationships or melodic ones.</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, the thought of having an 8+7 porcupine keyboard seems<br/>&gt; &gt; like it would be an awesome way to conceptualize porcupine, as<br/>&gt; &gt; well as an intuitive way for people used to the Halberstadt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There should always be a tiered 2-D isomorphic layout for<br/>&gt; any MOS structure, like the Carlos layout for 7+5, which is<br/>&gt; isomorphic. But you&apos;d need a separate keyboard for each.<br/>&gt; A flat keyboard might be colored to indicate the structure.<br/>&gt; With OLED keycaps (ala Maximus keyboard)...</p><p>Sure, but what about if you&apos;re doing 7+5+3 or something?</p><p>&gt; &gt; 22 would probably make the most sense in a three tiered<br/>&gt; &gt; structure, something like 8+7+7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should say I think MOS are over-rated. In pajara, Paul&apos;s<br/>&gt; preferred scales (the pentachordal scales) aren&apos;t MOS.</p><p>I guess you could set it up around any complementary set of scales. So<br/>if you were going to set up 22, you could then set it up like 10+7+5<br/>or something.

(I am quite disappointed that the Wilson clavichord has only 2 keys duplicated in each octave.)  For a 19-tone mapping I found that 12 duplicates (or 31 total keys/octave) are sufficient.  Also, the duplicate keys make a longer key shape (such as Bosanquet used) unnecessary, and the keys do not have to be as narrow.</p><p>&gt; Wilson&apos;s designs are quite like my own from the 90s, when I still had time for them.

The key surfaces are slightly convex, which enables the player to feel the location of the finger on the surface with respect to the center.  Another consequence is that a glissando is extremely easy to execute on any part of the keyboard in any direction.</p><p>You might think that the relative lack of 3-dimensionality in having the keys in a single plane would require the player to rely on sight more than touch in navigating the keyboard, but I found that this is not the case, I have always kept the instrument covered with a bedsheet when it&apos;s not being used.  After I had it for several months, I thought it would be fun trying to play it with the sheet on it.  To my surprise (and great delight), it was almost as easy as playing it without the sheet.  Sometimes when I had a guest at the house who had not seen the instrument before, I would first play it with the sheet on it without revealing what was underneath, which made for a rather surrealistic experience to say the least.</p><p>&gt; The possibilities are endless.

Since that time there have been several keyboards and other sorts of controllers, beginning with the Starrlabs Microzone.
