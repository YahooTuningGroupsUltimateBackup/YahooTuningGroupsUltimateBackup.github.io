There<br/>are at least two kinds of electronic drones commonly used in both<br/>Hindustani and Carnatic classical music (sometimes both kinds of drones<br/>are used in the same performance):</p><p>* Electronic sruti boxes -- these play three (or more) tones continuously<br/>  (often tonic, fifth, octave); acoustic sruti boxes sound like a chord<br/>  on a harmonium and their electronic counterparts sound like an<br/>  electronic imitation of the same</p><p>* Electronic tanpura -- these simulate four (or more) plucked strings<br/>  played individually in a cycle (often fifth, octave, octave, tonic);<br/>  acoustic tanpura are large four (or more) stringed plucked lutes</p><p>The older electronic tanpura do not sound much like real tanpura, but<br/>lately some electronic tanpura which apparently have samples of acoustic<br/>tanpura have appeared on the market.  I believe that &quot;Buckingham Music&quot;<br/>(<a href="http://www.io.com/~peterc/index.html">http://www.io.com/~peterc/index.html</a>) occasionally carries the new<br/>kind, though I do not seem them on the web page just now.</p><p>The Ali Akbar College Store is another place worth checking, although<br/>again I do not see the new kind there at present:<br/><a href="http://www.aacm.org/shop/index.html">http://www.aacm.org/shop/index.html</a></p><p>Although the older electronic tanpura and electronic sruti boxes do not<br/>sound as good as acoustic tanpura or acoustic sruti boxes it is worth<br/>noting that they do a tolerable job of providing a constant drone for<br/>performing musicians and are, in many cases, much more practical than<br/>arranging for accompaniment by humans playing acoustic drones for Indian<br/>musicians touring abroad.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div><h3><a id=12077 href="#12077">ðŸ”—</a>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2000 1:54:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Christopher,</p><p>Hi!</p><p>This must have been what I was hearing at the concerts I metioned<br/>yesterday. I have never owned a Tanpura, but I have been able to play<br/>the ones that friends have - and the realism of the sound of the<br/>electronic ones I heard was such that it did really make me think it<br/>was samples. I must admit, it was very lovely sounding.</p><p>Thanks for you notes on this,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Christopher J.
