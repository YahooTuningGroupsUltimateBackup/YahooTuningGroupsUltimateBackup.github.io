Rather lengthy, a full-length requiem... probably 40<br/>&gt;minutes, //  Nice sounds of the overtone series behind the singing<br/>&gt;added, at times, to the &quot;ethereal&quot; effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Joseph Pehrson, Sun, 14 May 2000.</p><p>&gt;I got the cd a few days ago...it&apos;s ok. I&apos;ve heard more interesting<br/>&gt;Harmonic singing other places.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - David Beardsley, Fri Jun 14, 2002.</p><p>I agree about the harmonic singing.  I think this came off as<br/>gimmicky, and it apparently distracts from the significance of<br/>the rest of the music.</p><p>Rendered in 12-equal, I don&apos;t think this composition would be so<br/>noteworthy.  But it is nice -- deep enough without being sappy,<br/>complex without being show-offy.  Rendered in JI, though, it&apos;s<br/>mind-blowing.</p><p>&gt;// an astonishing hour-long vocal work in extremely extended JI,<br/>&gt;// Incredibly complex and very beautiful, // It&apos;s by far the most<br/>&gt;amazing tuning feat I&apos;ve ever heard in a vocal composition. The<br/>&gt;score is unbelievably complex, but the music doesn&apos;t give any<br/>&gt;hint of the amount of work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Kyle Gann, Thu Jan 2, 2003.</p><p>Oh, I get a hint!  Some very nice polyrhythms and part crossings,<br/>and the tuning complexity is quite obvious!</p><p>--------</p><p>Kyle makes an excellent point here, whether or not you agree with<br/>him about Toby&apos;s score...</p><p>&gt;The value of a tuning method is not only in how the music sounds,<br/>&gt;but how the process of composing it operates and feels. I&apos;m sure<br/>&gt;someone could make a version of my Custer and Sitting Bull in<br/>&gt;31tet, or 53tet, or 7200tet, that I wouldn&apos;t be able to tell from<br/>&gt;the version I made myself. But I wouldn&apos;t have enjoyed composing<br/>&gt;it in an ET, wouldn&apos;t have come up with the same ideas, wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;have stumbled across the same weirdly unequal scales, nor would<br/>&gt;the resulting notation be as clear an expression of the way I<br/>&gt;conceived the music as the JI notation is. Perhaps you compose<br/>&gt;exactly the same way in ET as in JI, but for me and some people,<br/>&gt;the way the pitch space is set up has a pervasive, if subtle,<br/>&gt;impact on the way one thinks compositionally. I think Toby&apos;s score<br/>&gt;itself is an amazing achievement, and the Johnston accidentals<br/>&gt;show you not only what frequencies to play, but what harmonic<br/>&gt;relationships Toby was composing with.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Justin Weaver &#x3C;improvist@usa.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2003 9:07:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think the balance of the below-quoted pragraph actually supports the idea that the<br/>value of a tuning method is indeed measured in the sounds it produces... Why?<br/>Because the selected tuning method determines how the composer conceives the<br/>music and structures the piece. So, in essence, &quot;how the process of<br/>composing...operates and feels&quot; determins &quot;how the music sounds.&quot; -Justin</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The value of a tuning method is not only in how the music sounds,<br/>&gt; &gt;but how the process of composing it operates and feels.

Harmonic chant isn&apos;t a part of the tradition but 3-limit chant<br/>and 5-limit harmonic music is. I&apos;m also into Eastern Orthodox canting traditions,<br/>which are theoretically pythagorean but seem to my ears to admit numerous 5-limit<br/>intervals. Chant and chant-styled music is among the best-suited traditions for JI, I<br/>think. I think JI could actually make headway in Catholic liturgy. Our choir is basically<br/>singing in 5-limit anyway. -Justin</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;David Beardsley&quot; &lt;db@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Justin Weaver&quot; &lt;improvist@u...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I happen to think the mystical tradition of Catholic culture is the<br/>&gt; perfect context in<br/>&gt; &gt; which to situate an extended JI work. -Justin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was brought up Presbyterian, so I find the Catholic church<br/>&gt; a bit foreign.
