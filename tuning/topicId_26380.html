To be specific I have seen a few diagrams, lattices, etc lately of some of Ben Johnston&apos;s work. I use this example only because I am thoroughly familiar with his work.</p><p>Some of the diagrams shown on here have been, so to speak, complete lattices of an entire piece. Specifically posted not long ago were lists of notes with the 6th quartet, if I remember correctly.</p><p>With Johnston&apos;s work especially this type of analysis is, in my opinion, pretty dang useless and more complicated then necessary. I&apos;m not saying lattices are not valuable, because they most definitely can be, but in the context of Johnston&apos;s work they are very far in the background of compositional practice.<br/>For example:</p><p>With Johnston&apos;s work it is all about modulation to microtonal keys. Lets say for example he uses a major chord. I&apos;m using this example merely for simplicity.</p><p>C-E-G.</p><p>Now lets say he modulates to, in his notation, C-(C minus). He would argue that this the same chord modulated down via comma. To look at this and list all 6 pitch classes is not as important as understanding that the music modulates. To speak more &quot;in the large&quot; suppose he used a whole passage of notes in a song, say 12 pitch classes. Now suppose he modulates to 5 different keys using those same pitch classes, which is not uncommon for him. This example highlights why it is not only simpler to understand via modulation, as opossed to all pitches at once in a big lattice, because of the huge amounts of notes. The analyzer when looking at the music only has to remember the relationships between the 12 pitch classes and then in their head modulate them to the appropriate place which is simple if you&apos;ve done it once.</p><p>On a last note this is not intended as a thorough description of Ben&apos;s modulation technique so please dont take it as such. In a nutshell however its basically standard modulation technique. Common tones, etc.. Lastly alot of his music does this, but its more common in his later stuff.</p><p>So to sum up I agree. Time is an extremely important part of music. Lattices, analysis, etc, should reflect it if possible.</p><p>Bye bye,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=26394 href="#26394">ðŸ”—</a>PageWizard17@aol.com</h3><span>7/23/2001 3:59:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Justin,</p><p>    I have believed for quite a long time now, even in the ignorant presence<br/>of the 12 ET system, that when time is involved with a scale system, the<br/>consonance/dissonance of the scale is determined by the complex relations<br/>between the ratios before and theoretically after it.  You can see this<br/>simply by taking even a very &quot;consonant chord&quot; such as a sus4 and placing it<br/>in the middle of a dissonant chord progression.  Subjectively, the individual<br/>chordal consonance is sacrificed and combined with the other dissonances or<br/>consonances of the progression.  This is why an entire composition in memory<br/>will seem as roughly one huge &quot;watercolor&quot; chord.  The brain tends to group<br/>similar things into one.  This is also evident with overtones and octave<br/>equivalence and with all consonances for that matter.<br/>    I believe the that the sole reason of consonance is due to the similarity<br/>it bears to the reference.  Since unity is the ultimate consonance, any other<br/>tone which bears a closer resemblance to unity will have a stronger<br/>consonance than any tone which does not.  As of now, though, I cannot concern<br/>myself particularly with the complexities which time and memory involve,<br/>though I still enjoy theorizing about it.  In order to find the optimal<br/>tuning system, I must first search after purity of ratios.  I feel that there<br/>are many ratios, possessing certain purities, which have never been<br/>discovered.  It would only be through the experimentation of a new system<br/>that I would be able to figure out what its true potential was.  I have been<br/>doing such experimentation with the 12 ET system.  I have found that it lacks<br/>consonance to a large degree.  There are few real &quot;consonances&quot; with 12 ET.<br/>There are a great deal of dissonances that exist.  These dissonances are not<br/>very good either because they tend to &quot;blend&quot; into one another.  I have<br/>discovered that this blending is no good.  Each individual tone, or chord,<br/>should have a distinct quality whether that be a consonant or a dissonant<br/>one.  This will allow the a piece of music in the new system to have a<br/>stronger effect upon one&apos;s perceived memory.  This will also make music much<br/>more powerful since it is the computation of the relations between ratios<br/>which gives music its strengths or weaknesses.  Please let me know what you<br/>think.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Brent</p></div><h3><a id=26399 href="#26399">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2001 7:41:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; With Johnston&apos;s work it is all about modulation to microtonal keys.<br/>&gt;Lets say for example he uses a major chord.

In some circumstances they are extremely helpful, but in the context of large pieces of music with many notes, especially in many dimensions or highly modulatory, lattices are not helpful.

I was not trying to imply a definitive &quot;not,&quot; but I see from this statement why you interpreted it that way. I was referring mostly to the context of Ben&apos;s later work, and I thought I had made that clear, because I think this is a relatively true statement for that work. A great example would be the ninth quartet. Also with some of his work, and the sixth was discussed briefly. I think the amount of precomp which people think happens in his work is not proportional to the actual amount of precomp in his work. This of course would not be fair to say about all of his work as I just said.</p><p>Of course with something like the microtonal piano sonata, as we both know, nearly the opposite is true. With that piece theres alot of precomp. Ben has always spoken to me about that piece, micro piano sonata, in terms of boulez, which says something about what he was thinking in that particular context.<br/>I think however that that piece is more the exception then the rule, and I think Ben would agree if I asked him specifically about that as well.</p><p>Good luck getting over your strep. I caught it once as well, it sucks...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=26489 href="#26489">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/26/2001 6:02:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26380.html#26486">/tuning/topicId_26380.html#26486</a></p><p>I think, Andy, on the overview I&apos;m pretty much understanding what<br/>you&apos;re trying to get at.</p><p>It would seem initially that Ben Johnston would be an EXCESSIVELY pre-<br/>compositional composer with all the lattices, chroma upon chroma,<br/>serialism, complex set construction based upon the harmonic series,<br/>etc., etc.</p><p>HOWEVER, his music really doesn&apos;t SOUND so much like that (well, with<br/>the exception of the 6th String Quartet which is nobody&apos;s favorite,<br/>even *his* as I understand it...).</p><p>His music SOUNDS pretty &quot;intuitive...&quot; so somehow he balances all the<br/>background theory with pure listening.</p><p>It seems that&apos;s what you are trying to stress, and I think<br/>particularly with a composer with such strong theoretical<br/>underpinings as Ben Johnston, it&apos;s a good and important point...</p><p>_______ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=26491 href="#26491">ðŸ”—</a>JoJoBuBu@aol.com</h3><span>7/26/2001 7:10:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I think, Andy, on the overview I&apos;m pretty much &gt;understanding what<br/>&gt;you&apos;re trying to get at.</p><p>&gt;It would seem initially that Ben Johnston would be an &gt;EXCESSIVELY pre-<br/>&gt;compositional composer with all the lattices, chroma &gt;upon chroma,<br/>&gt;serialism, complex set construction based upon the &gt;harmonic series,<br/>&gt;etc., etc.</p><p>&gt;HOWEVER, his music really doesn&apos;t SOUND so much like &gt;that (well, with<br/>&gt;the exception of the 6th String Quartet which is &gt;nobody&apos;s favorite,<br/>&gt;even *his* as I understand it...).</p><p>Yes. Yes he actually considered rewriting the 6th quartet for a while, but decided against it. You are very much getting at what I think Ben is saying and my meaning, with his music most especially with his later music, although its there to a lesser extent in his earlier music depending on the piece. He calls this, &quot;art concealing art,&quot; and if my brain serves me correctly you can read an article about it in the book, &quot;20th century composers on 20th century music&quot; by I think elliot shwartz and barney childs. I could be wrong there because all of my books and articles are packed up in preparation for my move and so I might have a  screwed up citation or article but I think thats the one. You can blame my brain as long as you dont blame me. (hehe)However the point is the same Ben calls this general process, as you mention above, Art concealing art and it is an extremely important part of his music by his own admission.</p><p>&gt;His music SOUNDS pretty &quot;intuitive...&quot; so somehow he &gt;balances all the<br/>&gt;background theory with pure listening.</p><p>Ben would absolutely agree with you. In fact thats the point of art concealing art so you are describing Bens music in a way similar to how he would. That article will describe this process more. Its abstract, but if you know his scores well you will see specifically what he is referring to in his music.</p><p>&gt;It seems that&apos;s what you are trying to stress, and I &gt;think<br/>&gt;particularly with a composer with such strong &gt;theoretical<br/>&gt;underpinings as Ben Johnston, it&apos;s a good and &gt;important point...</p><p>&gt;_______ ______ ______<br/>&gt;Joseph Pehrson</p><p>Thanks Joe. I absolutely think you were understanding what I was getting at and I appreciate the comments. In fact the way you described it is very similar to the way I have heard Ben describe his own music many many times, which is of course what I am trying to convey as best as I can.</p><p>Cheers Joe,<br/>Andy</p></div>
