Beatles &quot;Get Back&quot; at</p><p><a href="http://sharehouse.xoom.com/dnload.php3?FILE_ID=107992">http://sharehouse.xoom.com/dnload.php3?FILE_ID=107992</a></p><p>A little of the same at the end is in equal tempered, to show how badly out<br/>of tune it immediately becomes (the EQUAL TEMPERED is out of tune).</p><p>2. A Chinese violin concerto with a midi piano accompaniment, the<br/>&quot;Butterfly Lovers&quot; at</p><p><a href="http://sharehouse.xoom.com/dnload.php3?FILE_ID=107910">http://sharehouse.xoom.com/dnload.php3?FILE_ID=107910</a></p><p>The violin is played with all octaves extended, i.e., 81/40 instead of 2/1.<br/>Since listeners cannot stand a just tuned piano, the piano is in equal<br/>tempered.<br/>However, the violin harmonic A 880 Hz prevails  in the piece so much that<br/>the open string A = 440 Hz becomes out of tune in the extended octave<br/>environment.<br/>Hence A 440 becomes 434.6 Hz, and the piano is tuned at this A, equal<br/>tempered over a keyboard on the regular 2/1 octave.</p><p>Please email me for more well-tuned Jazz, Blues, Beatles or violin.<br/>The more chromatic the music is, the better the intonation becomes.</p><p>Linus Liu.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2000 8:14:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Linus Liu wrote...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1.
