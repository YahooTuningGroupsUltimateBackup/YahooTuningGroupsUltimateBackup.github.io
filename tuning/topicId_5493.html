That was the first thing I read after Doty&apos;s JI Primer, when<br/>I got into all this business two years ago.  I thought it was a<br/>masterpiece.  I don&apos;t remember anything about Bach, and unfortunately I<br/>can&apos;t check, since my copy is on loan.</p><p>&gt;I dunno, Carl- I admire the guys originality and vision, his inventiveness<br/>&gt;and industry, but the actual music? I played Guitar One in two performances<br/>&gt;of Revelation at the Courthouse Park, and of course have heard other stuff.<br/>&gt;Let&apos;s take one of his most frequently performed works- US Highball. Do you<br/>&gt;really consider this &quot;great music&quot; on the same creative level as (forget<br/>&gt;Bach and Beethoven) the best of Lou Harrison, Stravinsky, Shostokovitch etc?</p><p>Lou Harrison is great with tea, but let&apos;s not mention him with Partch,<br/>Stravinsky, or Shosti.  Essential Partch for me is Oedipus, Revelation, The<br/>Bewitched, Petals, Dreamer.  Oh, I don&apos;t know, it&apos;s hard!  It&apos;s all good<br/>(and I haven&apos;t given Delusion a fair shake yet)!</p><p>The main problem I see people having with Partch is the timbres.  In fact,<br/>that&apos;s the main problem I see in all cross-style listening.  Not that this<br/>applies to you -- maybe we just have different taste.  But have you tried<br/>listening, imagining it all for guitar?  All of those percussion sounds are<br/>notes!  It&apos;s a shame that Partch, to date, must be heard through mediocre<br/>performances, bad recordings, and instrument disrepair.</p><p>A good friend of mine, who loves prog. rock and bebop, can&apos;t get classical.<br/> I think it&apos;s because he isn&apos;t following the notes.  He just hears sounds<br/>-- ever notice that musicians tend to listen, overwhelmingly, to music<br/>written for their instrument?</p><p>&gt;Maybe you could recomend what you consider his best piece and I could<br/>check &gt;it out (if I haven&apos;t heard it).</p><p>Try Dreamer.  Maybe his best short work, and probably his most listenable.<br/>Humor me and listen in the dark.</p><p>&gt;T might lack depth sometimes but his melodic invention is second to none.<br/>&gt;Nielsen is not on the same level.</p><p>T&apos;s melodic invention is quite good, but second to a few.  I agree with<br/>that second bit completely.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The point stands that there are many works more deserving than, say, the<br/>&gt;&gt;1812, in other periods and even in T&apos;s own output, that have been recorded<br/>&gt;&gt;far less.  Beethovan had trouble getting past Moonlight, much to his<br/>&gt;&gt;chagrin.  How many times have you heard Sonata 28, which fits in the &quot;no<br/>&gt;&gt;better organization of sound known to man&quot; department?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I think you can walk into any record store and find dozens of recordings of<br/>&gt;all the Beethoven Sonatas. How many do there really need to be?</p><p>I&apos;m wasn&apos;t talking about numbers of recordings here.  I was talking about<br/>the number of performances, in the composer&apos;s times and today.  So how many<br/>times have you heard #28?</p><p>&gt;Sibelius? I remember a time many years ago when I listened to Sibelius&apos;<br/>&gt;Second every day for a couple of months and derived great spiritual<br/>&gt;sustenance from it.</p><p>I confess my exposure to Sibelius leaves much to be desired.  So this<br/>second is recommended?</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=5562 href="#5562">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@xxxxx.xxxx.xx.xx</h3><span>10/18/1999 8:17:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(I realise that I am late with this comment, but we had a total mail<br/>collapse)</p><p>The problem I have with this discussion of the place of Partch vis a<br/>vis JSB is that I have heard a great deal of music by Bach, and can<br/>form an opinion on it.  I do not think I have heard above 1 piece of<br/>Partch, and I am not sure that I did hear even that much.</p><p>Rather makes it hard to trade names.</p><p>==JOhn ff</p></div>
