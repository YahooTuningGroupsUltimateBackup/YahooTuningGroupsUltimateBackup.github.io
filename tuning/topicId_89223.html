Something to find multivals could also be a fun project for anyone who actually likes to code.</p></div><h3><a id=89229 href="#89229">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2010 11:09:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;Present! Throw your ideas at me. My goal is to make a general microtonal utility site.&quot;</p><p>A few ideas:<br/>1) A dyad/chord tester.  Plays many well-known micro-tonal chords or lets you create your own and compare/rate how they sound to you and lets you load samples of different instruments to test how different timbres feel with such chords.<br/>2)  A scale generator.  Enter things like dyads or chord you like (or select from a list of what you entered in #1), select a maximum number of tones for the scale, select a maximum allowed number of cents deviation from your chords/dyads...and the scale generator will make a few scales with as many chords/dyads you like as possible and then tell you<br/>   A) If the scale is near a certain MOS, TET, regular temperament, or other type of pre-existing scale<br/>   B) Where the chords/dyads you like appear in the scale</p><p>I already kind of have 2...only it kind of cheats in that it requires you to enter just a few generators it can use (in any order) to create a scale and then shows you all combinations that fit the octave within 10 cents with all intervals being within a certain number of cents from selected dyads.</p><p>  Oddly enough, that program &quot;automatically&quot; led me to two of Gene&apos;s strictly proper 7-tone scales which, as I recall, were aimed at being widely accepted among a test group...when I gave it the criteria of no notes more than 10 cents off my favorite dyads of 6/5 and greater value.  So I think that sort of thing can be of some serious use...loading artificial intelligence guided by human criteria/aesthetic tastes.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=89230 href="#89230">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2010 11:11:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; A few ideas:<br/>&gt; 1) A dyad/chord tester.&nbsp; Plays many well-known micro-tonal chords or lets you create your own and compare/rate how they sound to you and lets you load samples of different instruments to test how different timbres feel with such chords.</p><p>Already made that, if I could just get my website back up.

BTW...does it let you save your favorite chords or dyads as a list (or, if not, can it)?</p></div>
