That I don&apos;t know.</p><p>In a much later paper, Euler described relative<br/>consonance as a continuum based on the complexity<br/>of the rational numbers, much as Schoenberg, Partch<br/>and myself do.  So he was perhaps willing to admit<br/>higher odd- or prime-limits in music.  I don&apos;t know<br/>about this either.</p><p>&gt; 22TET could be a good alternative to 12. I have not tested<br/>&gt; it, how well does it approximate the different genus?</p><p>Paul Erlich likes 22-ET a lot, partly because it is<br/>consistent in the 7-limit.  He would certainly be able<br/>to say more about it.</p><p>And Ivor Darreg was a big advocate of 17-ET, also in your<br/>list of ETs with consistent 64:63.</p><p>-monzo</p><p> |\=/|.-&quot;&quot;&quot;-.
