Cheap guitars are even worse.  So if people who do<br/>&gt; this professionally can&apos;t get it right, what are the chances that I&apos;m going to<br/>get<br/>&gt; anywhere close?</p><p>It might amaze you (or perhaps it might not!) how little guitar manufacturers<br/>know about tuning.  Epiphone guitars, at least while I was in college, I found<br/>to be dreadfully out-of-tune with themselves, for example.  Luthiers&apos;<br/>Merchantile sells fretting charts so that makers don&apos;t have to do any<br/>calculations.  Some of them don&apos;t know what the calculations are.  A few even<br/>still stick with &quot;the rule of the 18th,&quot; which basically estimates the twelfth<br/>root of 2 to be 18/17.  That&apos;s a pretty good estimate for a half step alone, but<br/>the error really adds up quickly when you apply it repeatedly.</p><p>The most common mistake though is not applying a bridge correction - pushing the<br/>bridge slightly away from the nut to compensate for the fact that the bridge is<br/>higher than the nut.  That causes higher frets to have higher tension than the<br/>lower frets, and pushing the bridge back makes compensates for that by giving<br/>those higher frets a greater percentage lengthening than the lower ones.</p></div>
