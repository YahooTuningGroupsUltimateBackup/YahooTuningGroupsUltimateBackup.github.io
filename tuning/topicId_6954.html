Tess<br/>&gt;Knighton and David Fallows (New York, Schirmer Books, 1992),<br/>&gt;pp. 316-326, Rogers Covey-Crump suggests that many vocal consorts<br/>&gt;&quot;tend towards Mean Tone tuning, but the best performers, when<br/>&gt;thoroughly rehearsed, are capable of Just or Pythagorean tuning.&quot;  He<br/>&gt;recommends Pythagorean for most medieval styles through Machaut and<br/>&gt;his late 14th-century successors, and Just (i.e. 5-limit) for<br/>&gt;Renaissance music. For some English or Anglo-Norman medieval styles of<br/>&gt;the 13th and 14th centuries, he notes the possibility of &quot;alternative<br/>&gt;or mixed tunings of thirds&quot; which might lean toward a kind of 5-limit<br/>&gt;JI (as suggested around 1300 by Walter Odington).</p><p>&gt;At the same time, he observes (like Paul Erlich here) that &quot;tuning is<br/>&gt;mainly about vertical chording and not about solo melodic lines,&quot; and<br/>&gt;that &quot;consistency of interval size ... is a feature of the best<br/>&gt;western European singers.&quot;</p><p>&gt;This suggests that either Renaissance or 20th-century singers<br/>&gt;approaching the 16th-century repertory may in fact be doing at least<br/>&gt;some adaptive JI with tempering of melodic intervals.</p><p>That&apos;s what I would suggest as a possible solution for not only 16th but<br/>even 17th and 18th century music on variable-pitch instruments. Though JI<br/>harmonies would be achieved, it runs counter to the  standard JI line, which<br/>goes more like this:</p><p>&gt;While Ramos set a possible precedent with his monochord of 1482,<br/>&gt;16th-century theorists such as Fogliano and Zarlino championed the<br/>&gt;syntonic diatonic of Ptolemy with its unequal 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones<br/>&gt;as the natural intonation for unaccompanied voices.</p><p>and discards consistency of interval size (and forces comma shifts/drifts)<br/>to uphold an abstract mathematical ideal. Meanwhile, even Zarlino became the<br/>first champion of a mathematically precise meantone in practice, namely<br/>2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;Describing the common practice as &quot;tempered and mixed music,&quot; and<br/>&gt;basing the tuning of the first 19 notes of his instrument on usual<br/>&gt;meantone (likely 1/4-comma with pure major thirds), [Vicentino] directed<br/>that<br/>&gt;the 17 notes of his second manual should be tuned in perfect fifths<br/>&gt;with those of the first manual. The result, assuming a basic 1/4-comma<br/>&gt;temperament, would be sonorities with pure fifths and minor thirds, as<br/>&gt;well as major thirds, if the performer can reach the appropriate keys<br/>&gt;on both manuals simultaneously.</p><p>This would provide all the pitches necessary for rendering most 16th-19th<br/>century music in the form of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; I&apos;ve been suggesting to John<br/>deLaubenfels. While acheiving the same harmonic purity as strict JI, this<br/>scheme would reduce the size of the shifts and drifts involved by a factor<br/>of 4, down to an imperceptible level, without substantially increasing the<br/>total number of pitches required. I independently conceived this idea of<br/>combining vertical JI and horizontal meantone in late 1993, after attending<br/>my first AFMM concert and speaking with Johnny Reinhard.</p><p>&gt;While Vicentino&apos;s advice to singers to rely on his instrument for<br/>&gt;finding their intervals would most obviously apply to his first tuning<br/>&gt;with 31 notes arranged to divide the octave into more or less equal<br/>&gt;dieses or fifthtones (the remaining 5 notes used for adaptive JI for a<br/>&gt;few frequent sonorities), it could also apply to this second tuning.<br/>&gt;In other words, singers might have emulated this tuning to realize a<br/>&gt;kind of JI based on melodic intervals at or very close to those of<br/>&gt;1/4-comma meantone</p><p>So Vicentino is on record for recommending his instrument as a model for<br/>singers, but we don&apos;t know which instrument?</p><p>&gt;From the viewpoint of practical composition, the issue of classic<br/>&gt;vs. adaptive JI for voices (or either model vs. keyboard meantone)<br/>&gt;might not have much observable impact.</p><p>I would disagree -- in those cases where the second degree of the major<br/>scale is in the upper melody and is forced to shift up by a comma because of<br/>a change in the harmony from subdominant to dominant, or else the overall<br/>pitch level is forced to shift down by a comma, classic JI is audibly a poor<br/>solution. When the shift occurs in an inner voice, I agree that it is hard<br/>to hear, though I&apos;d still prefer the sensation of melodic &quot;certainty&quot; that<br/>occurs in meantone or Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI.</p><p>&gt;On a personal note, I might add that while playing a keyboard in<br/>&gt;classic 5-limit JI is an exacting experience, it is also a unique one,<br/>&gt;and that I do not find unequal 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones unpleasant. At<br/>&gt;least for some music some of the time, this experience is not only<br/>&gt;possible but most rewarding.</p><p>Certainly unequal whole-tones can be an acquired taste. When there is no<br/>harmonic progression or modulation, they can take on a melodic certainty of<br/>their own. Such a situation arises in Indian music, where the &quot;natural&quot;<br/>scale is the same as the &quot;syntonic diatonic&quot; except with the sixth degree<br/>raised by a comma. I think it significant that this &quot;alteration&quot; (it is only<br/>an alteration by Eurocentric standards) creates an upper tetrachord<br/>identical to the lower one.</p><p>&gt;Finally, I might suggest a pragmatic study of intonation as practiced,<br/>&gt;for example, by vocal groups famed for their &quot;just&quot; tuning of<br/>&gt;16th-century music. Would we find some approximation of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt;syntonic diatonic, or of a Vicentino/Erlich adaptive tuning, or<br/>&gt;something else?</p><p>Though I doubt any vocal group would be able to control their melodic<br/>intonation to much better than 10 cents, the comma shifts implied by the<br/>&quot;classic JI&quot; or &quot;syntonic diatonic&quot; tuning would amount to 21.5 cents, and<br/>their presence or absence should be clearly ascertainable by such a study.</p></div>
