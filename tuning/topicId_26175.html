This is<br/>a big favourite on this list. Although if you only want to _compare_<br/>ratios there&apos;s no need to take the log. Just use the product, which we<br/>call complexity rather than distance. Of course the logs have the<br/>advantage of being able to be added, e.g. when looking at distances on<br/>a lattice.</p><p>One thing that bothers some of us about these measures is that they<br/>don&apos;t take into account the apparent decrease in harmonic distance<br/>when the smallest number in the ratio is a power of two; so called<br/>&quot;rootedness&quot;. And of course there&apos;s tolerance and span.</p><p>Factors of two are not removed in Tenney&apos;s. But of course if you do<br/>remove factors of two, it would make sense to call it<br/>&quot;Octave-equivalent Harmonic Distance&quot;.</p><p>For a comparison of many harmonic complexity measures see my Excel<br/>spreadsheet<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/HarmonicComplexity.zip">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/HarmonicComplexity.zip</a></p><p>For definitions of &quot;harmonic distance&quot;, &quot;katapyknosis&quot; and many other<br/>tuning terms, bookmark the Tuning Dictionary of the amazing Monz.
