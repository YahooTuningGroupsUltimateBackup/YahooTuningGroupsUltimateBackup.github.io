The &quot;boundary&quot;<br/>generally might be at around 125 cents or a bit lower, depending<br/>on the context.</p><p>This is worth briefly pointing out. Thus 126 cents would<br/>represent Jz1 under lots of conditions -- but in a 16th century<br/>European setting in 19-EDO or 1/3-comma meantone, it&apos;s really a<br/>very large 5-limit diatonic semitone. I&apos;m writing mainly about<br/>maqam contexts where the fifths are likely to be pure or very<br/>close to pure (Pythagorean, 53-EDO, 41-EDO), or possibly a bit<br/>larger (e.g. O3, average 703.871 cents).</p><p>Your comment led me to focus on the point that I didn&apos;t discuss<br/>15:14, giving me an opportunity to clarify that I see it near the<br/>upper limit of Jz0.</p><p>And whatever your methodological questions about the reported<br/>tetrachord of 123-137-228 cents, I would indeed call that example<br/>as reported an illustration of Jz1-Jz2-A10 -- the &quot;A10&quot; being<br/>borrowed from Turkish theory to show an &quot;augmented&quot; interval<br/>(somewhat greater than 9:8) of about 10 commas, and here almost<br/>exactly so.</p><p>As for your alternative reading:</p><p> 117 148 223<br/>0 117 265 488</p><p>I&apos;d call this Jz0-Jz2.5-A10, with the &quot;Jz2.5&quot; showing that 148<br/>cents is almost exactly half of a 32/27. And we agree that 117<br/>cents, between 16:15 and 15:14, is within Jz0.</p><p>Anyway, regardless of how one chooses to interpret this example,<br/>Ozan&apos;s observation about the main issue of how Turkish theory<br/>varies from the YAEU system is quite correct. Here&apos;s a quick<br/>summary.</p><p>In the YAEU system, a Maqam like Ushshaq is supposed to be 8-5-9<br/>commas, or 180-114-204 cents or in approximate JI terms,<br/>10:9-16:15-9:8. However, as skilled Turkish performers and also<br/>investigators like Karl Signell (who measured some of the tunings<br/>of these performers) have long known, the real tuning might be<br/>more like 6-7-9 commas (136-158-204 cents), with two very clear<br/>neutral second steps. Signell found that the lower step tended to<br/>range from around 133 to 148 cents.</p><p>Politically, the YAEU system was designed to accommodate the<br/>Turkish ultranationalist ideology of the early Republican era<br/>(starting in 1923) which held that neutral intervals were a<br/>product of Greek, Byzantine, or Arab &quot;decadence,&quot; as opposed to<br/>the simple, cheerful, and progressive Turkish spirit turning<br/>toward the dynamic West and its 12-note diatonic scale, refined<br/>through Pythagorean tuning and 5-limit schismatic intervals. Thus<br/>&quot;quartertones&quot; could be avoided, and the maqamat notated in a a<br/>form which the properly initiated could read in the traditional<br/>way.</p><p>For example, Ushshaq might be notated (here I&apos;m using arbitrary<br/>rather than Turkish symbols) D E-c F G -- with E-c at a comma<br/>below 9:8. However, those in the know would read that &quot;-c&quot; as<br/>closer to three commas below 9:8, and play what Signell observed<br/>and measured.</p><p>So a value like 148 cents in Ushshaq contradicts YAEU, unless we<br/>take it as a momentary &quot;mistuning&quot; or &quot;artistic liberty&quot;: and<br/>steps of 133-148 cents are clearly the norm, not the exception.<br/>This specific example doesn&apos;t really affect that conclusion.</p><p>&gt;  Where did you get the Yarman 24 paper?</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/yarman24.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/yarman24.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  Ozan&apos;s thesis mentions that both 72- and 84-EDO have been used<br/>&gt;  for tuning qanuns. He doesn&apos;t give good arguments against<br/>&gt;  them. Each has a better 9/8 than his 79 note MOS, for example.</p><p>This is true for Ozan&apos;s 9/8 step at either 13 or 14 yarmans<br/>(around 2/159 octave or about 15.09 cents each), a rounded 196 or<br/>211 cents. There are some virtually just 9:8 steps at 13L yarmans<br/>(12 usual yarmans plus the single &quot;large&quot; yarman in the 79-MOS at<br/>a full Holderian comma or 1/53 octave), but not at this location.</p><p>As I see it, the big advantage of the 79-MOS -- or, better yet, a<br/>complete 159-EDO if that were technical possible -- is the high<br/>resolution of about 7.55 cents or 1/3-comma.</p><p>The disadvantage is that we get lots of locations where the only<br/>available fifths are impure by 7.5 cents, a somewhat greater<br/>impurity that in 19-EDO or 22-EDO.</p><p>Of course, the reply might be: &quot;Nevertheless, we have pure or<br/>virtually pure 3/2 fifths in the places they are most needed for<br/>the standard positions of untransposed maqamat -- plus advantages<br/>like a meantone path to a 17-comma flavor of Rast.&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s how I might see some of this, coming from an angle a bit<br/>different than Ozan&apos;s, and also striving to recognize his<br/>concerns that might not play much if any role in the kinds of<br/>smaller systems I tend to use and design. People who read this<br/>should also read my important disclaimer which follows:</p><p>      (1) While 41-EDO is very nice for Pythagorean and 5-limit<br/>          schismatic intervals as well as ratios of 2-3-7, neatly<br/>          yielding a small major third at 380.5 cents or so at<br/>          the &quot;just a tad smaller than 5/4&quot; zone so much desired,<br/>          I see real limitations with neutral or Zalzalian<br/>          intervals. In short, the only way of dividing the 292.7<br/>          cent minor third is geometrically: 146.34-146.34.</p><p>          Likewise, the closest approximation to a Zalzalian or<br/>          neutral third flavor of Rast is 205-146-146, with a<br/>          third at 351 cents, or precisely half of the fifth.<br/>          For a Rast, especially a Turkish Rast, I&apos;d want<br/>          something close to 16/13 or higher. We have the<br/>          near-5/4 flavor, of course, but not a &quot;higher neutral<br/>          third&quot; flavor. In that aspect, apart from the size of<br/>          the minor third very close to 32/27, this is to me much<br/>          like the 150-150 division of 24/48/72-EDO. It&apos;s a<br/>          usable choice, but we&apos;d like others as well.</p><p>      (2) A qanun in 53-EDO seems to me the safe, conservative,<br/>          and theoretically friendly choice, covering both YAEU<br/>          (a 20th-century Turkish theory basically focusing on<br/>          Pythagorean and 5-limit schismatic intervals and<br/>          playing down neutral or Zalzalian ones, largely for<br/>          ideological reasons explained in Ozan thesis, and very<br/>          readably so), and two flavors of neutral intervals, for<br/>          example neutral seconds at 6 commas (136 cents) and 7<br/>          commas (158 cents). The fifths and fourths are<br/>          uniformly near-pure, and we could likewise use a<br/>          53-note Pythagorean cycle (one odd fifth narrow by<br/>          about 3.615 cents, Mercator&apos;s comma) to get a touch of<br/>          yet more subtle variety. Since the 53-comma system is<br/>          standard, with the neutral intervals fully admitted<br/>          into truly modern Turkish theory, there&apos;s a very nice<br/>          fit between the tuning and the prevalent model.</p><p>      (3) With 72-EDO, we have three neutral seconds at 133, 150,<br/>          and 167 cents, as well as quite congenial positions for<br/>          the third degree in Rast at 367 or 383 cents. And<br/>          either 313 or 333 cents might likewise be conducive for<br/>          a 5-limit minor or a supraminor flavor of Maqam<br/>          Nihavend or Maqam Segah.</p><p>          What are the disadvantages as I might see them, or<br/>          Ozan? Here the considerations might sometimes differ:</p><p>                (a) We might want a regular minor third, here<br/>                    300 cents, which is a bit smaller (with 32/27<br/>                    as one traditional ideal), or more<br/>                    specifically supports some unequal neutral<br/>                    second division (the same issue as in<br/>                    41-EDO). Our only choice is 150-150 --<br/>                    although we have the attractive unequal<br/>                    divisions of 133-150 or 150-133, as well an<br/>                    attractive equal division for 7:6 of 133-133.</p><p>                (b) To be fair, there are some other great<br/>                    divisions, like 150-267-83 for Hijaz.<br/>                    OTOH, I&apos;d love an idiomatically Turkish<br/>                    Huseyni with a minor third a bit smaller than<br/>                    300 cents and a division into two neutral<br/>                    seconds. We have 167-133, but I&apos;d love<br/>                    something like 167-127, for example. We have<br/>                    150-133, but here we really want the first<br/>                    step at 160 cents or larger. In fairness, I<br/>                    can&apos;t get 166-128-204 in the 79-MOS either,<br/>                    although all three interval sizes are<br/>                    present.</p><p>                (c) One might prefer having the regular limma a<br/>                    bit smaller than 100 cents, maybe Pythagorean<br/>                    (256/243, 90 cents) or a bit smaller.</p><p>                (d) As Ozan might point out, 72-EDO is not a<br/>                    meantone and has no path to meantone. Since<br/>                    he is seeking a version of Rast from a single<br/>                    chain of fifths, this is an impediment under<br/>                    his criteria.</p><p>      (4) With 82-EDO, we have the fine Pythagorean/schismatic<br/>          framework of 41, but three neutral seconds at 132, 146,<br/>          and 161 cents. This gives a fine Rast at 205-161-132<br/>          cents, and a fine Huseyni at 161-132-205. What it<br/>          doesn&apos;t have is a meantone path to Rast, nor the<br/>          resolution of the 79-MOS, which may reflect the basic<br/>          advantage of an irregular tuning as versus a complete<br/>          EDO in getting more interval sizes for a given tuning<br/>          size.</p><p>      (5) With 84-EDO, one possible disadvantage is the step at<br/>          precisely 1/7 octave, valuable for many world musics,<br/>          but not so often visited in lots of maqam music where<br/>          one tends to jump from 11:10 or so the the territory<br/>          near 10:9. In 72-EDO or 82-EDO, this step is in the<br/>          &quot;sweet zone&quot; (for maqam music) close to 11:10.</p><p>      (6) With 96-EDO, with have four neutral second sizes, at<br/>          125, 137.5, 150, and 162.5 cents. Shaahin Mohaheri has<br/>          used this tuning or subsets of it, and the variety of<br/>          neutral steps and intervals is a big plus.</p><p>Thus I might paraphrase Ozan&apos;s points about 72-EDO somewhat as<br/>follows:</p><p>      (1) Like 24-EDO, it has a regular 300-cent minor third<br/>          permitting only an equal neutral second division at<br/>          150-150 cents.</p><p>      (2) There is no meantone path to a near-5/4 step for Maqam<br/>          Rast -- not a concept of traditional maqam theory, but<br/>          an important contemporary one to Ozan.</p><p>      (3) The overall organization is different enough from<br/>          53-EDO (or a 53-note Pythagorean cycle, I might add) to<br/>          cause some complication for musicians attuned to the<br/>          53-comma system.</p><p>      (4) One might prefer regular diatonic intervals closer to<br/>          Pythagorean, so that divisions like those of the<br/>          medieval treatises (e.g. 32/27 into two unequal neutral<br/>          seconds) can more often and more closely apply.</p><p>If I were investigating possible alternatives under Ozan&apos;s<br/>groundrules, I might look at supersets of a complete 53-EDO<br/>circle. Whether this might require a satisfactory set<br/>considerably larger than 79/80, or a set of not more than 79/80<br/>notes with considerably less utility than the actual 79/80=MOS,<br/>I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>MAJOR DISCLAIMER: Since I&apos;ve dealt with 24 notes per octave as a<br/>norm on a regularized keyboard (not a generalized one!), looking<br/>at EDO or MOS sets of 41-84 notes is really a theoretical rather<br/>than practical exercise for me.</p><p>From experience, I do know that an EDO is the least effective way<br/>to get a variety of step sizes in a given tuning size. Thus I<br/>might be a lot less passionate about &quot;X-EDO vs. Y-EDO&quot; debates,<br/>because I find them mostly academic.</p><p>And, needless to say, I am much less well-situated than a Turkish<br/>musician, especially one as well-informed about both tradition<br/>maqam styles and some modern innovations as Ozan, to judge what<br/>the criteria should be for a contemporary maqam tuning.</p><p>However, I can say that six neutral second sizes, lots of them<br/>near-epimoric, are a very attractive proposition.</p><p>And one thing I _do_ know: different agendas can lead to very<br/>different tuning systems.</p><p>For example, with my O3 system, Ozan could well point out that it<br/>is impossible within the given 24 steps to find even a basic<br/>9-note set for a 26/21 Rast (the notes from the lower tetrachord<br/>plus the conjunct and disjunct forms of an upper Rast tetrachord)<br/>without encountering some quirk of the tuning, and either having<br/>to substitute a septimal for a regular step, or else having a<br/>neutral sixth at a more or less notably low position.</p><p>We would quickly agree that this is so because a regular solution<br/>would require a chain of at least 12 fifths, 3 up for a regular<br/>major sixth, e.g. B-G# (~22/13 in this system); and 9 down for a<br/>diminished sixth, e.g. B-Ab (~33/20 in this system).</p><p>Since a single chain has only 11 fifths (Eb-G#), we have a choice<br/>of B-G# for the major sixth or F#-Eb for the large neutral sixth,<br/>but not of having both above the same step chosen as the final or<br/>resting note of Maqam Rast.</p><p>There are various compromises and strategies for handling this:</p><p>       (1) Choose F#* for the final, and use septimal steps at<br/>           ~8/7 and ~12/7 in place of ~9/8 and ~22/13. This can<br/>           be a wonderful incentive to use beautiful medieval<br/>           tunings more often!</p><p>       (2) Choose B* for the final, and accept a low neutral<br/>           sixth at around 854 cents, and a 485-cent fourth<br/>           between this lower neutral sixth and the usual high<br/>           neutral third at ~26/21 or 369 cents.</p><p>       (3) Focus on the usual form of sixth best supported for a<br/>           given final -- either ~22/13 or ~33/20.</p><p>       (4) If regularity is at a premium, use a 357-359 cent<br/>           Rast more in the Arab manner, where it is possible<br/>           to get a congruent set of up to 17 notes in the<br/>           manner of Wilson&apos;s Rast-Bayyati matrix (mixing<br/>           notes from both chains). Just to show that it&apos;s<br/>           possible:</p><p>         G*   A*   B   C*   D*   E   E*   F*  F#   G*<br/>         0   209  359 497  704  854  912 993 1062 1200</p><p>Since a system of this kind has scope closer to a 17-tone Persian<br/>tuning (noncirculating) than to any EDO within the range of sizes<br/>we&apos;re discussing, I&apos;m probably not the best person to judge the<br/>whole EDO question, except to say that Ozan has reasonably chosen<br/>a non-EDO to get more step sizes, as well as features like a<br/>meantone path to certain intervals and tetrachords.</p><p>But if we really want to look for something &quot;competitive&quot; to the<br/>79/80-MOS, as I might imagine myself doing had I been his thesis<br/>advisor or the like, I&apos;d be looking not at EDO systems, which<br/>simply won&apos;t give the same resolution and diversity for neutral<br/>or middle intervals, but at irregular tunings like supersets of<br/>53-EDO (maybe bringing in additional steps from 159-EDO or<br/>212-EDO) offering other solutions including a complete 53-EDO<br/>circle,a nd thus the virtually pure 3/2 fifths at all 53 primary<br/>locations.</p><p>And there is a big complication which doesn&apos;t arise for an EDO<br/>(all intervals available from all locations), but very well could<br/>for such competitive alternatives: unity and coordination of<br/>pitches in a way that will be idiomatically Turkish. Here O3 is an<br/>excellent &quot;how not to&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>In O3, the final of Rast might be B or F#* for a Turkish flavor<br/>(~26/21), but maybe G* if we want more of an Arab or &quot;_low _<br/>Turkish&quot; flavor (357-359 cents). This is a bit like a European<br/>12-note well-temperament, although without the circulation!</p><p>For a good Turkish gamut, we&apos;d need to consider what steps or<br/>nuances are available at a given &quot;standard&quot; location, and how the<br/>system holds together using a credible set of standard locations<br/>for the different maqamat. That&apos;s what this a lot more<br/>complicated than looking at accuracy of prime approximations, or<br/>even variety of neutral steps in itself (as with O3).</p><p>There are also contextual and historical factors at play here. I<br/>can certainly understand how a Turkish musician might point to<br/>qanun-s tuned in 72-EDO as a possible sign of the encroaching<br/>influence of 12-EDO or 24-EDO. If, hypothetically, we were<br/>talking about 288-EDO (also a subdivision of 12-EDO), things<br/>might be a bit different:</p><p>         (1) While the regular third remains 300 cents, we have<br/>             tempered fifths at 695.83, 700, 704.17, and 708.33<br/>             cents as ingredients for various regular or<br/>             irregular &quot;subtemperaments&quot; producing, for regular<br/>             chains of fifths, minor thirds at 312.5 cents, 300<br/>             cents (of course), 287.5 cents, or 275 cents. And a<br/>             chain alternating 700-704.17 would closely<br/>             approximate Pythagorean or 53-EDO.</p><p>         (2) For 300 cents, we&apos;d have unequal divisions like<br/>             154-146 (subtly unequal); 158-142 (a bit like 7-6<br/>             commas). etc. Not to mention various divisions at<br/>             thirds at 292 or 296 cents, closest to Pythagorean.</p><p>         (3) More generally, from 125 to 167 cents, we&apos;d have no<br/>             less than 11 shadings of neutral seconds.</p><p>         (4) The limmas at 87.5 cents or 91 cents should<br/>             especially congenial to 41-EDO or 53-EDO outlook.</p><p>If we were debating 288-EDO, the whole discussion might be<br/>different, because we get better support for a lot of features<br/>that the 79-MOS has and 72-EDO doesn&apos;t at least to the same<br/>degree. Building a physically and ergonomically practical<br/>instrument in 288-EDO, of course, might be another question; but<br/>I feei it&apos;s a good thought-experiment to clarify the &quot;12n-EDO&quot;<br/>question.</p><p>And some creatively diverting thought-experiements might be<br/>helpful for this group and everyone concerned.</p><p>&gt;  Graham</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=94593 href="#94593">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2010 4:53:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;  Jz0 is 16:15 and jz1 is 14:13, remember.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi, Graham.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This may raise a point that my crude table didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; address: Jz0 would include 16:15 or the very slightly<br/>&gt; larger interval of 2187/2084 (a Pythagorean apotome at<br/>&gt; 114 cents) or 5 commas, minutely smaller in 53-EDO, as a<br/>&gt; typical size, but also the superparticular ratio of 15:14<br/>&gt; or 119 cents.

It wouldn&apos;t help me if I<br/>did, but does it sound like a Jz1 to you?</p><p>&gt; Anyway, regardless of how one chooses to interpret this<br/>&gt; example, Ozan&apos;s observation about the main issue of how<br/>&gt; Turkish theory varies from the YAEU system is quite<br/>&gt; correct. Here&apos;s a quick summary.</p><p>It looks like middle eastern music differs from any fixed<br/>system.  YAEU is unfortunate in making specific predictions<br/>that it can be tested against.  And it&apos;s not the issue<br/>here, although it happens to be in Ozan&apos;s thesis.</p><p>&gt; So a value like 148 cents in Ushshaq contradicts YAEU,<br/>&gt; unless we take it as a momentary &quot;mistuning&quot; or &quot;artistic<br/>&gt; liberty&quot;: and steps of 133-148 cents are clearly the<br/>&gt; norm, not the exception. This specific example doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; really affect that conclusion.</p><p>Right, you can take anything as a mistuning if you want to.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  Where did you get the Yarman 24 paper?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/yarman24.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/yarman24.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Thank you!  Another Turkish one, then.  But it gives the<br/>scale (Tablo 7, right?) that&apos;s used in an English paper.</p><p>&gt; As I see it, the big advantage of the 79-MOS -- or,<br/>&gt; better yet, a complete 159-EDO if that were technical<br/>&gt; possible -- is the high resolution of about 7.55 cents or<br/>&gt; 1/3-comma.</p><p>159-EDO would indeed be great if it were technically<br/>possible.  The 79-MOS loses that resolution.</p><p>&gt; The disadvantage is that we get lots of locations where<br/>&gt; the only available fifths are impure by 7.5 cents, a<br/>&gt; somewhat greater impurity that in 19-EDO or 22-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, the reply might be: &quot;Nevertheless, we have<br/>&gt; pure or virtually pure 3/2 fifths in the places they are<br/>&gt; most needed for the standard positions of untransposed<br/>&gt; maqamat -- plus advantages like a meantone path to a<br/>&gt; 17-comma flavor of Rast.&quot;</p><p>Yes, but the 9:8 isn&apos;t in the right place, and it&apos;s<br/>supposed to support transposition.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s how I might see some of this, coming from an angle<br/>&gt; a bit different than Ozan&apos;s, and also striving to<br/>&gt; recognize his concerns that might not play much if any<br/>&gt; role in the kinds of smaller systems I tend to use and<br/>&gt; design. People who read this should also read my<br/>&gt; important disclaimer which follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        (1) While 41-EDO is very nice for Pythagorean and<br/>&gt; 5-limit schismatic intervals as well as ratios of 2-3-7,<br/>&gt; neatly yielding a small major third at 380.5 cents or so<br/>&gt; at the &quot;just a tad smaller than 5/4&quot; zone so much desired,<br/>&gt;            I see real limitations with neutral or<br/>&gt; Zalzalian intervals. In short, the only way of dividing<br/>&gt; the 292.7 cent minor third is geometrically:<br/>&gt; 146.34-146.34.</p><p>This is something that&apos;s often suggested in theory.  I<br/>don&apos;t now how seriously to take it.  Some musicians in the<br/>middle east have accepted 24-EDO.  Have blind trials been<br/>done on any musicians to show that they reject equal<br/>neutral thirds?</p><p>Also, for the true style, you need variability of pitch.<br/>So any system would only be the default pitches you bend<br/>relative to.  Given that, musicians can have their unequal<br/>divisions in an equal system.</p><p>&gt;            Likewise, the closest approximation to a<br/>&gt; Zalzalian or neutral third flavor of Rast is 205-146-146,<br/>&gt; with a third at 351 cents, or precisely half of the fifth.<br/>&gt;            For a Rast, especially a Turkish Rast, I&apos;d want<br/>&gt;            something close to 16/13 or higher. We have the<br/>&gt;            near-5/4 flavor, of course, but not a &quot;higher<br/>&gt; neutral third&quot; flavor. In that aspect, apart from the<br/>&gt; size of the minor third very close to 32/27, this is to<br/>&gt; me much like the 150-150 division of 24/48/72-EDO. It&apos;s a<br/>&gt;            usable choice, but we&apos;d like others as well.</p><p>The choice is bound to be limited with a small number of<br/>notes.</p><p>&gt;        (2) A qanun in 53-EDO seems to me the safe,<br/>&gt; conservative, and theoretically friendly choice, covering<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;            53-note Pythagorean cycle (one odd fifth<br/>&gt; narrow by about 3.615 cents, Mercator&apos;s comma) to get a<br/>&gt; touch of yet more subtle variety. Since the 53-comma<br/>&gt; system is standard, with the neutral intervals fully<br/>&gt; admitted into truly modern Turkish theory, there&apos;s a very<br/>&gt; nice fit between the tuning and the prevalent model.</p><p>This is one that Ozan does address, and doesn&apos;t like.  But<br/>still, it looks pretty good.  I don&apos;t know how it would be<br/>received outside Turkey, though.</p><p>&gt;        (3) With 72-EDO, we have three neutral seconds at<br/>&gt; 133, 150, and 167 cents, as well as quite congenial<br/>&gt; positions for the third degree in Rast at 367 or 383<br/>&gt; cents. And either 313 or 333 cents might likewise be<br/>&gt; conducive for a 5-limit minor or a supraminor flavor of<br/>&gt; Maqam Nihavend or Maqam Segah.</p><p>It&apos;s a good tuning in the 5-limit and beyond, and it has<br/>the right precision.</p><p>&gt;            What are the disadvantages as I might see<br/>&gt; them, or Ozan? Here the considerations might sometimes<br/>&gt; differ:<br/>&gt;<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;                      step at 160 cents or larger. In<br/>&gt; fairness, I can&apos;t get 166-128-204 in the 79-MOS either,<br/>&gt;                      although all three interval sizes are<br/>&gt;                      present.</p><p>That&apos;s it.  You can go into details about what you do or<br/>don&apos;t want, but no fixed system of 70-80 notes will give<br/>you everything.  72-EDO is an obvious choice and nobody&apos;s<br/>convinced me why it&apos;s inferior to 79-MOS.</p><p>&gt;                  (c) One might prefer having the regular<br/>&gt; limma a bit smaller than 100 cents, maybe Pythagorean<br/>&gt;                      (256/243, 90 cents) or a bit smaller.</p><p>I don&apos;t think we need to worry about 10 cent errors.  The<br/>data we&apos;ve been looking at show a 4:3 coming out 10 cents<br/>flat.</p><p>&gt;                  (d) As Ozan might point out, 72-EDO is<br/>&gt; not a meantone and has no path to meantone. Since<br/>&gt;                      he is seeking a version of Rast from<br/>&gt; a single chain of fifths, this is an impediment under<br/>&gt;                      his criteria.</p><p>Yes, if that&apos;s a criterion there are going to be problems,<br/>because maqam-like meantones are difficult to find.</p><p>&gt;        (4) With 82-EDO, we have the fine<br/>&gt; Pythagorean/schismatic framework of 41, but three neutral<br/>&gt; seconds at 132, 146, and 161 cents. This gives a fine<br/>&gt; Rast at 205-161-132 cents, and a fine Huseyni at<br/>&gt; 161-132-205. What it doesn&apos;t have is a meantone path to<br/>&gt; Rast, nor the resolution of the 79-MOS, which may reflect<br/>&gt; the basic advantage of an irregular tuning as versus a<br/>&gt; complete EDO in getting more interval sizes for a given<br/>&gt; tuning size.</p><p>As a temperament, it&apos;s not interesting because it&apos;s a<br/>contorted version of 41.</p><p>&gt;        (5) With 84-EDO, one possible disadvantage is the<br/>&gt; step at precisely 1/7 octave, valuable for many world<br/>&gt; musics, but not so often visited in lots of maqam music<br/>&gt; where one tends to jump from 11:10 or so the the territory<br/>&gt;            near 10:9. In 72-EDO or 82-EDO, this step is<br/>&gt; in the &quot;sweet zone&quot; (for maqam music) close to 11:10.</p><p>84 is interesting because it&apos;s an Orwell temperament, and<br/>Orwell has some properties that may suit it to middle<br/>eastern music.  But 84-EDO is reportedly less popular on<br/>qanuns than 72-EDO.</p><p>&gt;        (6) With 96-EDO, with have four neutral second<br/>&gt; sizes, at 125, 137.5, 150, and 162.5 cents. Shaahin<br/>&gt; Mohaheri has used this tuning or subsets of it, and the<br/>&gt; variety of neutral steps and intervals is a big plus.</p><p>Others have been proposed.  According to the Theory vs<br/>Practice paper (which I know you have) one Nail Yavuzoglu<br/>proposed both 40 and 48 divisions.  60 is interesting<br/>because it&apos;s Magic, along with 41.  It gives two distinct<br/>neutral seconds or thirds along with the 12-equal and<br/>5-limit choices.  It&apos;s what you&apos;d naively expect people to<br/>use if they have tuners with cents readouts, in that each<br/>division is 20 cents, a nice round number.  But in practice<br/>nobody seems to be using it.</p><p>&gt; Thus I might paraphrase Ozan&apos;s points about 72-EDO<br/>&gt; somewhat as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        (1) Like 24-EDO, it has a regular 300-cent minor<br/>&gt; third permitting only an equal neutral second division at<br/>&gt;            150-150 cents.</p><p>But it obviously permits other divisions.</p><p>&gt;        (2) There is no meantone path to a near-5/4 step<br/>&gt; for Maqam Rast -- not a concept of traditional maqam<br/>&gt; theory, but an important contemporary one to Ozan.</p><p>Yes, no meantone, but nobody else seems to want this.</p><p>&gt;        (3) The overall organization is different enough<br/>&gt; from 53-EDO (or a 53-note Pythagorean cycle, I might add)<br/>&gt; to cause some complication for musicians attuned to the<br/>&gt;            53-comma system.</p><p>Could be, but musicians are already mixing the systems.</p><p>&gt;        (4) One might prefer regular diatonic intervals<br/>&gt; closer to Pythagorean, so that divisions like those of the<br/>&gt;            medieval treatises (e.g. 32/27 into two<br/>&gt; unequal neutral seconds) can more often and more closely<br/>&gt; apply.</p><p>One might, yes.  But I don&apos;t know how far the Pythagorean<br/>chain goes in practice.</p><p>&gt; If I were investigating possible alternatives under Ozan&apos;s<br/>&gt; groundrules, I might look at supersets of a complete<br/>&gt; 53-EDO circle. Whether this might require a satisfactory<br/>&gt; set considerably larger than 79/80, or a set of not more<br/>&gt; than 79/80 notes with considerably less utility than the<br/>&gt; actual 79/80=MOS, I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>That&apos;s exactly what he looked at, of course.  It gets<br/>complicated.</p><p>&gt; And, needless to say, I am much less well-situated than a<br/>&gt; Turkish musician, especially one as well-informed about<br/>&gt; both tradition maqam styles and some modern innovations<br/>&gt; as Ozan, to judge what the criteria should be for a<br/>&gt; contemporary maqam tuning.</p><p>Only Ozan&apos;s in that position, and he&apos;s not communicating<br/>well.</p><p>&gt; For example, with my O3 system, Ozan could well point out<br/>&gt; that it is impossible within the given 24 steps to find<br/>&gt; even a basic 9-note set for a 26/21 Rast (the notes from<br/>&gt; the lower tetrachord plus the conjunct and disjunct forms<br/>&gt; of an upper Rast tetrachord) without encountering some<br/>&gt; quirk of the tuning, and either having to substitute a<br/>&gt; septimal for a regular step, or else having a neutral<br/>&gt; sixth at a more or less notably low position.</p><p>What was O3?  I&apos;m getting lost now.</p><p>&gt; But if we really want to look for something &quot;competitive&quot;<br/>&gt; to the 79/80-MOS, as I might imagine myself doing had I<br/>&gt; been his thesis advisor or the like, I&apos;d be looking not<br/>&gt; at EDO systems, which simply won&apos;t give the same<br/>&gt; resolution and diversity for neutral or middle intervals,<br/>&gt; but at irregular tunings like supersets of 53-EDO (maybe<br/>&gt; bringing in additional steps from 159-EDO or 212-EDO)<br/>&gt; offering other solutions including a complete 53-EDO<br/>&gt; circle,a nd thus the virtually pure 3/2 fifths at all 53<br/>&gt; primary locations.</p><p>EDOs give you transposition.  That&apos;s one of Ozan&apos;s<br/>requirements.</p><p>We were talking about rank 2 temperaments before he settled<br/>on the 79/80-MOS.  I&apos;ll mention some obvious candidates,<br/>that I havent had a good critique of.  I&apos;ve got an eye on<br/>harmony/polyphony, as does Ozan.  And in reality, this is<br/>all I care about, because I&apos;m not a maqam musician.</p><p>Schismatic (53&amp;41)</p><p>An obvious one as it&apos;s implied in some Arab/Persian<br/>documents.  The story, as I remember it from Farmer, is<br/>that some pitches were written both as string divisions<br/>implying a 5-limit interval, and positions on a Pythagorean<br/>chain implying the Schismatic equivalent.  But then Farmer<br/>says they probably intended the 5:4 intervals to be neutral<br/>thirds.  So we&apos;re supposed to assume they were smart enough<br/>to notice that 5:4 was very close to a Pythagorean<br/>interval, and then dumb enough to think that the two<br/>intervals were neutral thirds.  If that interpretation&apos;s<br/>valid, how can outsiders possibly make sense of the theory?</p><p>Anyway, Schismatic may work.  It ties in with some old<br/>theory, it gives good 5-limit intervals, and you eventually<br/>get neutral intervals.  They&apos;re distant on the chain of<br/>fifths so the scales will be complex but by the same rule<br/>you get a choice of tunings of the neutral seconds by small<br/>tweaks of the fifths.  Also supports tetrachordal<br/>structures.</p><p>Miracle (31&amp;41)</p><p>Obvious because it&apos;s so good in the 11-limit, and you get<br/>neutral intervals with the 11-limit.  It doesn&apos;t give a<br/>choice of neutral thirds, but it does of neutral seconds.<br/>41 is the near-Pythagorean tuning it works with.</p><p>Orwell (22&amp;31)</p><p>Has a choice of neutral intervals.  Has simple 11-limit<br/>harmony.  Includes a 53 note MOS.  The fifths are complex.<br/>9:8 is a remote interval and you won&apos;t get much<br/>tetrachordality.</p><p>Magic (22&amp;41)</p><p>Works with 60 and 41.  Has unequal neutral thirds.  Works<br/>reasonably with the 11-limit.  Neutral intervals are<br/>remote, but that means you get a choice of tunings.  There<br/>are plenty of them with 41 notes.</p><p>Catakleismic (72&amp;53)</p><p>Unites the two EDOs we were talking about.  Good 15-limit<br/>harmony.  Complex.</p><p>Harry (72&amp;58)</p><p>Good 15 and higher limit harmony.  Complex.</p><p>Tritikleismic (72&amp;87)</p><p>Covers both 72- and 153-EDOs.  An option in the 15-limit.<br/>Complex.</p><p>Mystery (29&amp;58)</p><p>Something Ozan considered but rejected, probably<br/>correctly.  Good 15-limit harmony if you can afford 58<br/>notes and don&apos;t want to stray outside the 58 note MOS.</p><p>This is a quick reply, anyway because my Internet<br/>connection&apos;s well overdue to time out.  A detailed<br/>discussion of desired pitches, would take a long time, and<br/>it&apos;s not one I can really appreciate anyway.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div>
