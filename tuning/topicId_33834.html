is that all you&apos;re referring to??</p><p>the register key is so called because it allows the player to<br/>more easily shift between different registers of the instrument.<br/>it&apos;s actually not necessary -- if a player blows hard enough<br/>the instrument will play a higher register anyway.  the term<br/>for this is &quot;overblow&quot;.</p><p>but the registers operate differently on the different woodwinds<br/>because of the shape of the tube.  most woodwinds are conical,<br/>which means that they overblow at the &quot;8ve&quot;.  the clarinet,<br/>with its cylindrical tube, is the exception: it overblows at<br/>the &quot;12th&quot;, which is an &quot;8ve&quot; below the 5th partial, ratio 5:2.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=33842 href="#33842">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2002 3:18:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; but the registers operate differently on the different woodwinds<br/>&gt; because of the shape of the tube.  most woodwinds are conical,<br/>&gt; which means that they overblow at the &quot;8ve&quot;.  the clarinet,<br/>&gt; with its cylindrical tube, is the exception: it overblows at<br/>&gt; the &quot;12th&quot;, which is an &quot;8ve&quot; below the 5th partial, ratio 5:2.</p><p>i think you&apos;re a little confused, monz. the &apos;12th&apos; is 3/1, with is<br/>the 3rd partial -- an &quot;8ve&quot; below the 5th partial would be a &apos;10th&apos;.<br/>a clarinet actually overblows at the &apos;12th&apos;, a 3/1 . . . and also,<br/>blowing harder, at the &apos;major 17th&apos;, a 5/1 . . . note that 1 is<br/>always in the denominator, since it&apos;s hard to acoustically involve a<br/>note *lower* than the true fundamental of the instrument.</p></div><h3><a id=33846 href="#33846">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2002 3:59:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: paulerlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, February 08, 2002 3:18 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: historical woodwind key systems<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but the registers operate differently on the different woodwinds<br/>&gt; &gt; because of the shape of the tube.  most woodwinds are conical,<br/>&gt; &gt; which means that they overblow at the &quot;8ve&quot;.  the clarinet,<br/>&gt; &gt; with its cylindrical tube, is the exception: it overblows at<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;12th&quot;, which is an &quot;8ve&quot; below the 5th partial, ratio 5:2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think you&apos;re a little confused, monz. the &apos;12th&apos; is 3/1, with is<br/>&gt; the 3rd partial -- an &quot;8ve&quot; below the 5th partial would be a &apos;10th&apos;.<br/>&gt; a clarinet actually overblows at the &apos;12th&apos;, a 3/1 . . . and also,<br/>&gt; blowing harder, at the &apos;major 17th&apos;, a 5/1 . . . note that 1 is<br/>&gt; always in the denominator, since it&apos;s hard to acoustically involve a<br/>&gt; note *lower* than the true fundamental of the instrument.</p><p>WHOOPS!!!!  a really big &quot;MY BAD&quot;!  thanks, paul.</p><p>yes, what i meant was that the clarinet (and all cylindrical tubes)<br/>overblows at the ratio 3:1, whereas conical tubes overblow at 2:1.</p><p>don&apos;t know how i managed to mess that up ... my first instrument,<br/>and always the main one in my younger days, was the clarinet.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
