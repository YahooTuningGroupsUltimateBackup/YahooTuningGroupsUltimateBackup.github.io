I<br/>don&apos;t have _Genesis_ right here at the moment, but I will check<br/>the &quot;alternate&quot; diamond reference he mentions...</p><p>JP</p><p>Joseph,</p><p>Thanks for your note.</p><p>I built the arrangement from a message someone sent to the tuning<br/>list many years ago. I sent a request to the list for someone to draw<br/>the diamond, and that is what came back. Several years later I bought<br/>a copy of &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; and noticed Partch&apos;s diamond on page<br/>159, which was different from mine. On page 261 he has it the way I<br/>use it, like his diamond marimba. &quot;Diagram 17 - Block Plan for the<br/>Diamond Marimba&quot;.</p><p>I have never built any instruments with the one on page 159.
