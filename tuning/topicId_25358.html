I<br/>don&apos;t have _Genesis_ right here at the moment, but I will check<br/>the &quot;alternate&quot; diamond reference he mentions...</p><p>JP</p><p>Joseph,</p><p>Thanks for your note.</p><p>I built the arrangement from a message someone sent to the tuning<br/>list many years ago. I sent a request to the list for someone to draw<br/>the diamond, and that is what came back. Several years later I bought<br/>a copy of &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; and noticed Partch&apos;s diamond on page<br/>159, which was different from mine. On page 261 he has it the way I<br/>use it, like his diamond marimba. &quot;Diagram 17 - Block Plan for the<br/>Diamond Marimba&quot;.</p><p>I have never built any instruments with the one on page 159.

I guess<br/>I forgot about the &quot;block plan&quot; right next to the photo of the<br/>physical Diamond Marimba.  Yes, certainly, then, that would be the<br/>one to try.</p><p>HOWEVER, it&apos;s interesting that Partch would change the order of the<br/>ratios on the PHYSICAL instrument where the THEORETICAL diamond that<br/>evolved from his theory on 159 is different...</p><p>Hmmm.  I wonder why he changed it?  And, I also wonder if<br/>the &quot;theoretical&quot; diamond would sound as good?</p><p>Anybody have any ideas??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>_________ ______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=25400 href="#25400">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2001 7:40:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hmmm.
