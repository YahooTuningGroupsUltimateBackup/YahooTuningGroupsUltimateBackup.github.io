Placing<br/>two pipes of like pitch near each other will allow them to influence the<br/>pitch of the other.  They called it &quot;drawing&quot; and explained it was due to the<br/>mechanical coupling of the the air.  When the pitch of one grew near the<br/>other, I was told that the beats disappeared, but when the two pipes were<br/>measured individually, their pitches were not exact.<br/>    I know that this can happen between the individual strings of a piano<br/>unison, because I tune with the Weinreich effect in mind and have measured<br/>and heard it to be true.  I don&apos;t get allowed around many organs, though...<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=40413 href="#40413">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2002 3:40:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., a440a@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; I tune with the Weinreich effect in mind and have measured<br/>&gt; and heard it to be true.</p><p>can you please describe the weinreich effect and your measurements?</p><p>thanks!</p></div><h3><a id=40433 href="#40433">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/31/2002 8:49:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/31/02 5:06:05 AM Central Standard Time, <a href="mailto:a440a@aol.com">a440a@aol.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; .
