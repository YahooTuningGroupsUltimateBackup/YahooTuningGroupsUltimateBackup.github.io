My approach has been to find a way to tune<br/>the partials to small number ratios in the series.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; One suggestion: the partials for an ideal free-free bar are:<br/>&gt;   f, 2.76f, 5.41f, 8.94f, 13.35f ....<br/>&gt; This sequence is approximated to within 0.5% by the integer series:<br/>&gt;   9, 25,    49,    81,    121...   (the squares of the odd numbers)<br/>&gt; You might try using these integers as starting points for<br/>&gt; your tuning.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this idea.  I get that the frequency of the fundamental<br/>is multiplied to get the frequency of the partials and that 9*2.76 is just<br/>about 25, etc.   How would one begin to develop a tuning based on these<br/>frequencies?</p><p>Darren</p></div>
