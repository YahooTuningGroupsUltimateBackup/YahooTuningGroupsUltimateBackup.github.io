Damn. I don&apos;t remember whether I was at that moment<br/>attempting to tune a harpsichord that arrived 1hr 40 min. late in a<br/>gymnasium while kids played soccer around me, cajoling the janitor to<br/>let me move it somewhere else, screaming at the janitor to let me<br/>move it somewhere else, or perhaps The harpsichord had already been<br/>moved to a relatively quite stairwell where I merely was tearing my<br/>hair out trying to make it playable; but unfortunately, despite<br/>being, in one sense, there, I missed a good deal of the microthon.<br/>For me, of what I heard, mostly in the second half, the performances<br/>on the various sorts of microfretted guitars were a revelation, both<br/>the magnificent playing of Wim Hoogenwerf and the somewhat<br/>uncomfortable playing on Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s Dinarras of<br/>standards by Cole Porter and Antonio Carlos Jobim which showed the<br/>practicalitites in daily musical life of microtuning (that&apos;s not<br/>quite what I ment to say, but hey, I spent the weekend in NYC<br/>breathing poisoned air, what can you expect...). Another highlight<br/>was Vishnegradski&apos;s meditation, 1918, played by Johnny Reinhardt and<br/>Joshua Pierce.</p><p>Judy</p></div><h3><a id=15473 href="#15473">ðŸ”—</a>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@shell1.tiac.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2000 10:16:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>One other point, which I should perhaps censor, but heck, it&apos;s a forum.</p><p>At the microthon, there was a certain lack of cooperation and courtesy<br/>among the performers which was unfortunate. People trying their<br/>instruments in the lobby while performances were audibly going on in the<br/>hall, people fussing with instruments on stage that they were going to<br/>play later while other people were centering themselves to perform. The<br/>times when sound checks were supposed to be happening were mass chaos with<br/>nobody really getting to do a check because everybody else was milling<br/>around trying to check their own sound at the same time, or just nervously<br/>playing bits of things for not reason at all, or in the case of a couple<br/>of groups, actually holding rehearsals. Lots of people sitting around in<br/>the hall having conversations during sound check time who should have been<br/>asked to talk outside. It didn&apos;t really surprise me, I have played in<br/>public high schools, for instance, quite a bit; but for an event at this<br/>level, the management should have been, well, more assertive.</p><p>Judith Conrad, Clavichord Player (<a href="mailto:jconrad@tiac.net">jconrad@tiac.net</a>)<br/>Music Minister, Calvary Baptist Church, Providence, RI<br/>Director of Fall River Fipple Fluters<br/>Piano and Harpsichord Tuner-Technician</p></div><h3><a id=15474 href="#15474">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>11/13/2000 12:06:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello all,</p><p>While it is not for me to say too much about the Microthon, I am leaving for<br/>Germany on Wednesday for research on Werckmeister and Bach and won&apos;t be back<br/>until the end of November.
