Instead of<br/>having 12 steps to the octave, a composer might<br/>want to have 31, or 10.</p><p>Several such possibilities were explored on<br/>Thursday night at the closing concert of<br/>this year&apos;s American Festival of Microtonal<br/>Music, which was held, regrettably, in St.<br/>Paul&apos;s Chapel on the Columbia University<br/>campus -- a space whose long reverberation<br/>fuzzed some of the subtlety of shape that made the music special.</p><p>Microtonal musicians exist partly in a<br/>world of their own, for reasons both historical<br/>and practical. To play unusual intervals<br/>accurately requires new techniques or new<br/>instruments, which are generally the province<br/>of specialist performers. Also, the norm<br/>for Western music has long been 12-step equal<br/>temperament, with anything else<br/>being regarded as irregular, eccentric or<br/>plain wrong.</p><p>That norm is so fixed in our ears that<br/>departures from it tend to sound malformed.<br/>Many of the pieces in this concert gave the<br/>impression of music squeezed, or melting,<br/>or heard at the bottom of a swimming pool.<br/>The feeling was slithery, weird or<br/>melancholy. But maybe listeners used, say,<br/>to Anton Rovner&apos;s quarter-tones would<br/>find Mozart harsh and granitic.</p><p>The program polemically suggested a<br/>millennium-long tradition of microtonal music<br/>by following Rovner&apos;s opener -- &quot;Appel &#xFFFD; Deux&quot;<br/>for viola and horn -- with a short<br/>history that went from an early medieval<br/>organum through a piece of Portuguese<br/>polyphony from around 1500 to short<br/>mid-20th-century samples from Percy Grainger<br/>and Ivan Wyschnegradsky.</p><p>Hearing Renaissance polyphony performed with<br/>decisive microtonal dissonances was<br/>distinctly odd, and none too credible: one<br/>would need strong evidence that the music<br/>could ever have sounded this way. But the<br/>Grainger item, his very short &quot;Free Music,&quot;<br/>was a spurt into an airy new world, suggesting<br/>that the most convincing microtonal<br/>music will be that which connects least with what we know.</p><p>In the rest of the program, Meredith Borden<br/>gave a gripping account of a rare early<br/>Harry Partch score, &quot;Potion Scene,&quot; setting<br/>the speech from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for<br/>soprano and viola (Anastasia Solberg). Johnny<br/>Reinhard, the festival&apos;s director, gave<br/>a formidable performance on his bassoon of<br/>Joseph Pehrson&apos;s &quot;One Small Step for<br/>Man,&quot; in eighth-notes, and Skip LaPlante, in<br/>&quot;Camping in the Backyard,&quot; offered an<br/>appealing, funny, simple set of sound pictures<br/>for flute, bassoon and string bass with<br/>his own homemade metallophone.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
