All your points are well-taken, although I should point out that is was Monzo, not me, who mentioned 5-limit JI in conjunction with pre-Renaissance a cappella singing.

This music sounds very alien<br/>to modern ears, accustomed to using triads as<br/>stable harmonies. It seems highly likely, given<br/>the extant examples of Gothic music, that music<br/>using thirds, sixths, or triads containing them<br/>as stable sonorities would have sounded quite<br/>alien to 13th century listeners (though such music<br/>was indeed developing in the British Isles and was<br/>poised to take over European style over the next<br/>few centuries). I refer you to Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>web pages and posts for amplification and<br/>substantiation of these points.</p></div>
