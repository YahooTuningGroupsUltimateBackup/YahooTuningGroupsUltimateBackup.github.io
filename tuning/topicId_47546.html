As far as other notations, Johnson is no<br/>better, in fact worse than Wilsons which is far more consistant.<br/>Considering his butchering of Harry work for string quartet is enough<br/>grounds from keeping his name as far as way as possible.  The latter in<br/>turn would rightfully reject the idea of the scores coming out in his<br/>notation and for good reason. Thewy should exist in the form he put them<br/>possibly with footnotes for correction by those who know of his mistakes</p><p>If the scores are not out in three years i will quite seriously consider<br/>putting them out for free. i already have a copy of Castor and Pollux .<br/>10 minutes and it could be up. a 20 minute drive and i will grab the<br/>rest and put them up, one page a day. I ask some one to forward that to<br/>the publishers.</p><p>    One could bring up the question if Partch is in better shape now<br/>than say 20 years ago. his message has been castrated ( well he didn&apos;t<br/>really mean that) , his compositions homogenized into the  &quot;mainstream&quot;,<br/>and his instruments have been decorporealized (virtualized).</p><p>If it wasn&apos;t for the copies of his original productions, he would be<br/>totally destroyed.<br/>what exist second hand and available to the masses has made him<br/>incomprehensible.<br/>For the most part, they have furthered their own status at the expense<br/>of his.<br/>More people have been turned off of Partch, maybe for good, by such<br/>activities.<br/>This i know from personal experience, and i know others who have<br/>expressed the same</p><p>possibly they could make some prints of Rothko and brighten up the<br/>colors to expose all those who don&apos;t know his work</p><p>And please spare me from the notion that it will expose more people to<br/>his work.  go into the store and you can get them.<br/> I have been hearing now for 30 years how this and that compromised<br/>music or pop band is going to expand ears of the masses.

Just try and you will be notified<br/>immediately by the estate.</p><p>I understand this has been circumvented by legal loopholes with Partch&apos;s<br/>work by using previous versions. (disclaimer: one such ensemble does<br/>this until they can get the other instruments made, so in this way it<br/>more closely resembles the way that Partch had to perform them, they<br/>work toward the later versions at great sacrifice and to themselves))<br/>Imagine if i performed a Doors tune/poem based on an early draft in<br/>order to avoid the copywright 30 years from now and give it a britney to<br/>sing.
