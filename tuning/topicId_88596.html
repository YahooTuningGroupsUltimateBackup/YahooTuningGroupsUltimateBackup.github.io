The complex waves with approx GCD&apos;s (like 81/64, 32/27 or ET&apos;s etc...) can actually be rewritten as just intervals with exact GCD&apos;s, (5/4, 6/5 etc...) and with a phase shift in each component. In other words, they can be rewritten as periodic waves with a modulated phase. From my last post we got,<br/>aK/(a + b) = p + (r/(a + b),<br/>bK/(a + b) = q - (r/(a + b),<br/>where r = aq - pb, and adding gave K = (p + b). Now, if we multiply the (a + b)/(p + q) back out this gives<br/>a = p[(a + b)/(p + q)] + r/(p + q),<br/>b = q[(a + b)/(p + q)] - r/(p + q).</p><p>The original wave can now be written</p><p>f(t) = sin(2pi at) + sin(2pi bt) =<br/>sin[2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)])t + rt/(p + q)] +<br/>sin[2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)])t - rt/(p + q)].</p><p>If we let r = 0 momentarily, then f(t) reduces to a periodic function with the exact frequency (a + b)/(p + b). This is easily proved since this is by definition the exact GCD between p[(a + b)/(p + q)] and q[(a + b)/(p + q)] i.e. since p and q are whole they are the &quot;p&apos;th&quot; and &quot;q&apos;th&quot; harmonics to this fundamental. Thus, the original function can be regarded as a periodic function but with a modulated phase in both components, + rt/(p + q) for the first and - rt/(p + q) for the second. I&apos;ve posted a pdf with a couple of graphic examples from Mathematica.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2010 7:07:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>I suspect I am not understanding something because it sounds like you are<br/>saying a phase shift will retune a JI interval.<br/>I&apos;m a layman when it comes to things tuning - could you explain a little?</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Sun, May 2, 2010 at 7:59 AM, rick &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve found an interesting solution to this approx GCD problem and it&apos;s<br/>very simple.

So if you have 440 Hz and you add 450 Hz to it,<br/>&gt; you have just changed the pitch of what you&apos;re hearing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The same concept applies when you&apos;re playing tempered intervals. The<br/>&gt; coinciding partials don&apos;t just beat against each other, they retune<br/>&gt; each other as well. Of course, it&apos;s a little bit more complicated when<br/>&gt; tempering gets involved, because each successive harmonic slowly<br/>&gt; drifts further away from its &quot;beating&quot; counterpart, and so we have<br/>&gt; more of a partial-dependent vibrato going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike</p><p>Just to add to what Mike&apos;s saying here,</p><p>the PM formula is</p><p>f(t) = sin(2piat) + sin(2pibt) =<br/>sin[2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)])t + rt/(p + q)] + sin[2pi(p[(a + b)/(p + q)])t - rt/(p + q)],<br/>where r = aq - pb.</p><p>For Mike&apos;s particular example, if we take a = 450, b = 440, p = 45 and q = 44, we get<br/>sin(2pi440t) + sin(2pi450t) =<br/>sin[2pi(44*[890/89]t - 0t/89] + sin[2pi(45*[890/89]t + 0t/89],</p><p>that is, r = 0 and there&apos;s no phase mod.

Rick&apos;s formula adds only another term of the same form - wt+vt instead of wt - which just changes one steady frequency to another one.

This is why it&apos;s obvious. b:a = 439:450 perhaps would have been better. It gives q:p = 40:41 which you can try out for yourself. However, my point was meant to demonstrate something I&apos;ve always believed, that the concept of exact or approx GCD&apos;s is more fundamental than beating because intervals are dominated by the operation of division, not subtraction.</p><p>I think I&apos;ve figured out the final piece of the puzzle and your approach you sent me helped a great deal.
