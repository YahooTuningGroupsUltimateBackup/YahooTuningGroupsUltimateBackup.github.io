The only time I recall is a brief toss-off in your paper<br/>about how the decatonic scale was the only one that met certain<br/>conditions with fewer than fourteen notes.

The main<br/>difference was that even then I was determined to embed it in 31TET, and<br/>since there isn&apos;t an exact half-octave in 31TET the two diatonic scales<br/>overlapped by one pitch and I would end up with only thirteen pitches,<br/>which was just too uneven for me.  So I never really pursued it very<br/>much.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu">manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Hey--do you think I need to lose some weight?&quot;<br/>  -\-\-- o<br/>             NOTE: dehyphenate node to remove spamblock.          &lt;*&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=3470 href="#3470">ðŸ”—</a>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/1999 8:57:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Hahn wrote,</p><p>&gt; On 9 Jun 1999 <a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; The optimal &quot;fifth&quot; size for the tetradecatonic (double diatonic) scale<br/>&gt; &gt; (with 7-limit harmony) is 693.651 cents and can be derived as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting--Paul, have you mentioned this double diatonic scale on the<br/>&gt; list before?</p><p>Yes, and one of the times I attempted to determine which modes are most likely to function tonally.</p><p>&gt; The only time I recall is a brief toss-off in your paper<br/>&gt; about how the decatonic scale was the only one that met certain<br/>&gt; conditions with fewer than fourteen notes.
