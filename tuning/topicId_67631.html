I can read your post. You are my second acquaintance from Netherlands. I downloaded and listened to your piece. Nice to know that interest in microtonality around the world is proliferating! It was a refreshing composition, though a bit sparse in texture. I assume you were allowing room for listeners to appreciate non 12-tET sounds? Keep up the good work!</p><p>Oz.<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: taylan<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com">ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com</a><br/>  Sent: 04 Ekim 2006 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 19:36<br/>  Subject: [Fwd: Re: [tuning] 17-tone concert archive]</p><p>  I&apos;m trying to post this to the group, but failing :-(</p><p>  What should I do?</p><p>  Taylan</p><p>  -------- Originele bericht -------- Onderwerp:  Re: [tuning] 17-tone concert archive<br/>        Datum:  Wed, 04 Oct 2006 18:19:34 +0200<br/>        Van:  taylan &lt;<a href="mailto:tsusam@chello.nl">tsusam@chello.nl</a>&gt;<br/>        Aan:  <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>        Referenties:  &lt;<a href="mailto:efv7b9+5ssa@eGroups.com">efv7b9+5ssa@eGroups.com</a>&gt; &lt;004801c6e7c0$9ba72f40$2401a8c0@Ozan&gt;</p><p>Hi Ozan &amp; group,</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve posted before, but I&apos;ve been reading along for some<br/>time. Let me introduce myself: I am 19 years old, I study composition at<br/>the royal conservatory in the Hague. I also study comparative<br/>linguistics at Leiden. And I&apos;ve written a piece for the 17t piano project!</p><p>For some reason, my piece isn&apos;t in the player, but is available for<br/>download at the bottom of the page.</p><p>It&apos;s part of my &quot;past piano&quot; series, all for differently tuned pianos<br/>(there&apos;s even a 12tet piece in the series! :-)<br/>The title is a bit complicated to explain for now.</p><p>The harmonies heard are all derived from a 9-13-23 chord, which, is very<br/>accurately present in the 17t. I could also get a 3rd harmonic from 13,<br/>39 - since the fifth is a bit sharp &amp; the 13 was a bit flat. I really<br/>love the 13/9 and the 23/18!</p><p>I hope you enjoy it.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Taylan</p></div>
