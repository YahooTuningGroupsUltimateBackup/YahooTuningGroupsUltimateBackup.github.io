I recommend you not respond to, or even read, his posts.  But don&apos;t take my word for it.  Have a look over the last two weeks of flame bait he&apos;s posted and ask yourself if it was worth it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=88858 href="#88858">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 1:21:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;There has been a flurry of off-topic posts this evening, mostly in response to trolls from Michael.&quot;</p><p>    Well there you go...I start a topic and people veer off topic...and here I am being blamed for &quot;trolling&quot; for my attempts to get people back on topic.  Yet you don&apos;t seem to understand what trolling is considering the situation...and here&apos;s an in fact very on-topic discussion I am introducing for those who don&apos;t know (perhaps including yourself): what is trolling?</p><p>     Trolling involves making off-topic posts (like the ones made TO and not from me), setting a bait such as inflammatory messages and looking for a response IE someone doing something like clicking on a link to a malicious site or posting information that could ruin their reputation.  An example of trolling is someone asking for personal information saying &quot;You wussy!  If you really aren&apos;t one...post your picture to the &apos;macho men&apos;s club&apos;&quot; and then spreading the club list across the internet, making anyone who signed up look incredibly pompous.<br/>  Simply my being angry at people for going off-topic does not count...I did not make any inflammatory comments in a deliberate effort to set someone up for humiliation or exploitation.</p><p>Look at the definition<br/>        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29</a></p><p>     I was the one asking people to RETURN to the original topic...not one of the many veering things off topic.    If anything I was the one being trolled!</p></div>
