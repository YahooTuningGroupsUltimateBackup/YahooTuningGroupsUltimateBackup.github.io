A doable,<br/>step-by-step way for performers to tackle the entire scope of a<br/>virtual pitch continuum.</p><p>&gt; as well as the fact that WITHOUT the training, it may be more<br/>difficult and &quot;foreign&quot; for the average performer than Johnny&apos;s<br/>quarter-tone +/- 50.</p><p>I still absolutely, 100% do not get this! The +/- method still HAS to<br/>require a practical training procedure. This simply can not be in<br/>doubt! And I bet it&apos;s not much different from the one I advocate, a la<br/>Joe Maneri, for the 144 notation.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
