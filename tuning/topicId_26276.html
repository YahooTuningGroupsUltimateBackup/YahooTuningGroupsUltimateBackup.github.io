I can give some background information<br/>about him out of an article by Thijs Kramer. The reasons that his<br/>work is unfortunately relatively unknown are his untimely death and<br/>the fact that he postponed writing a book because he kept finding<br/>more and more material.</p><p>Ruth Tatlow wrote an article in _Music and Letters_ about Dieben,<br/>&quot;the Dutch pianist, who had an interest in number symbolism. In<br/>March 1943 he had solved for Smend the puzzle of Picander&apos;s<br/>_Paragramma Cabbalisticum trigonale_ by explaining to him the<br/>trigonal alphabet. Smend (...) nowhere acknowledged in print that it<br/>was Dieben who had shown him the solution to Picander&apos;s paragram.&quot;<br/>It was not the last time that Dieben would be plundered.<br/>  Wilhelm Werker was the first in 1922 to demonstrate that numbers<br/>are an important construction factor in the music of Bach. Dieben<br/>knew this and became curious after finding a book titled _Deutsche<br/>Caballa_ which explained number alphabets. He discovered in 1933<br/>that according to the Latin alphabet (A=1; I,J=9; U,V=20; Z=24),<br/>among others the numbers 14 (Bach), 29 (JSB, Soli Deo Gloria), 41<br/>(J.S. Bach) and 48 (2x1x3x8) represent an important factor in Bach&apos;s<br/>work. The changing of letters into numbers and vice versa is called<br/>gematria. Smend had spent 20 years finding biblical numbers in<br/>Bach&apos;s work but until Dieben told him he didn&apos;t know about the use<br/>of gematria by Bach. After several years Dieben had discovered<br/>enough to start giving lectures. After the war he became teacher at<br/>the Muzieklyceum in Amsterdam and occasionally gave lectures to add<br/>a bit to his very little income. His family suffered for his passion<br/>for Bach and it made him forget his lessons; he counted, combined,<br/>speculated and counted, with help of his wife. After his death, the<br/>piano had to be sold to pay for the funeral.<br/>  When Piet Ketting, the director of the Muzieklyceum hired him,<br/>they made the explicit agreement that Dieben alone would give<br/>lectures. When Dieben found out that Ketting did give lectures, he<br/>broke the relation off abruptly. Before he died, he told his wife<br/>not to give the manuscripts to Ketting. They went via Hans Brandt<br/>Buys to Gustav Leonhardt who, not knowing about Dieben&apos;s last words,<br/>handed them to Ketting for reading and donated them to the<br/>university of Utrecht.<br/>  Ketting got stuck in his own research and started a cooperation<br/>with the mathematician J. Bronkhorst. The latter did many<br/>discoveries, wrote a book but failed to give Ketting the necessary<br/>credit, which resulted in both hiring lawyers and Dieben&apos;s<br/>manuscript not getting a publisher again. Two pupils of Ketting, van<br/>Houten and Kasbergen, then published a book shortly after Ketting&apos;s<br/>death, presenting the work of Dieben, Ketting and Bronkhorst as it<br/>were their own, while also containing a lot of nonsense.<br/>  The more than ten thousand pages of the legacy with calculations,<br/>drawings and tables are now kept in the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague.<br/>  The two most important discoveries of Dieben are that Bach used<br/>gematria, and that Bach had affinity to the realm of ideas of the<br/>Fraternitas Rosae Crucis, the Rosicrucians.</p><p>Myself I&apos;m very sceptical that Bach numerology has anything to do<br/>with tuning however.</p><p>There is a Belgian C. Coppens at the university of Gent who wrote a<br/>1200-page thesis in Dutch about number symbolism in the WTC.<br/>If anyone wants to find more, one could try an Internet search on<br/>these people:<br/>Henk Dieben<br/>Wilhelm Werker<br/>Thijs Kramer<br/>Harry Hahn<br/>Friedrich Smend<br/>Ruth Tatlow</p><p>A few links:<br/><a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Topics/Numbers.htm">http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Topics/Numbers.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~tomita/WTC2Psalm/">http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/~tomita/WTC2Psalm/</a><br/><a href="http://users.castel.nl/~schic02/appendix.htm">http://users.castel.nl/~schic02/appendix.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Bach/getal.html">http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Bach/getal.html</a> (goede grap onderaan)</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
