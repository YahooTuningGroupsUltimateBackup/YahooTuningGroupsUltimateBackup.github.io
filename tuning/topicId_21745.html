It is a sad state of affairs. Even though it will bring<br/>that &quot;here we go again response&quot;, I must say that the only thing I<br/>think will ever change this, is something that our &quot;Patron Saint&quot;<br/>Harry Partch used to preach: We need significant bodies of musical<br/>works. Without this, we will never see the yoke of the 12 tET<br/>oppressor removed from the necks of the masses, and our beloved and<br/>beautiful theories will remain in obscurity. The tough thing is how<br/>one must wear many hats in this. Theory alone will achieve nothing<br/>but the perpetuation of more theory, but when it is &quot;projected into<br/>time&quot; in the final form of lasting works of profound musical art,<br/>that&apos;s when most folks who listen to music for music&apos;s sake, and<br/>don&apos;t give a hoot about the theory will begin to pay attention.<br/>Otherwise it&apos;s all just a hurricane of papers blowing about. It&apos;s<br/>the &quot;Projection into Time&quot; that is the hard part for most.</p><p>Our Mission is clear.</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
