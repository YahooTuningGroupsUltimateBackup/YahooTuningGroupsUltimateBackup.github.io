No matter<br/>what combination of pitches I had, there was no way around<br/>&apos;hearing&apos; its tonal implications to me, and invariably in the<br/>row, a note that I was &apos;obliged&apos; to use next didn&apos;t fit.</p><p>I saw JI as a way out of this dilemma, and it didn&apos;t take<br/>long before I began thinking that JI pitches could be<br/>manipulated in the same kinds of ways that Babbitt &amp;co. were<br/>talking about.</p><p>After that, I got so deeply into the theory that I never got<br/>around to writing those serial JI pieces, but I&apos;m inspired now...</p><p>RE: Berry&apos;s book</p><p>After commenting on how widely divergent are theorist&apos;s views<br/>on how pervasive tonality is - some, like myself, insisting<br/>that there&apos;s always *some* kind of tonality embedded in<br/>combinations of periodic tones, &apos;while others consider tonal<br/>coherence obliterated in contexts of relatively mild complications&apos;<br/>- Berry provides an interesting list, what he calls a &apos;conjectural<br/>set of classifications&apos;,  ranking the different &apos;levels of<br/>significance of tonal function&apos;, or what might be called &apos;degrees<br/>of relevancy of tonality&apos;, which I&apos;m going to present in reverse<br/>order  (I can&apos;t explain why - it just seems &apos;right&apos;):</p><p>[Wallace Berry, _Structural Functions in Music_, p. 172]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; primitive (&quot;pedal&quot;) tonality [i.e., drone]<br/>&gt; purely melodic tonality<br/>&gt; tonality of modal conventions<br/>&gt; tonality of ambivalent conventions<br/>&gt; conventional (major-minor) tonality<br/>&gt; tonality of quasi-functional manifestations<br/>&gt; extended (expanded) tonality<br/>&gt; tonal flux within broad, prevailing tonal unity<br/>&gt; tonal flux extinguishing, or severely attenuating, tonal function?<br/>&gt; multitonality?  pantonality?<br/>&gt; irrelevant tonality?<br/>&gt; atonality as a relative tendency?<br/>&gt; &quot;absolute&quot; atonality?</p><p>Very interesting to me how he uses Partch&apos;s term, one time<br/>in a category that I think describes Partch&apos;s technique well<br/>(tonal flux within broad, prevailing tonal unity).</p><p>Berry&apos;s telling question marks are the initial indication that<br/>he leans toward the first-mentioned camp of theorists.</p><p>Then he begins discussing specific examples of &apos;hierarchic<br/>tonal order ... implicit ... in a twelve tone set itself&apos;,<br/>one of which is Schoenberg&apos;s song _Tot_ (from op. 48).</p><p>In reading Berry&apos;s description of Schoenberg&apos;s tetrachordal<br/>segmentation of the row in his &apos;tonal&apos; treatment of the pitches,<br/>I began thinking about your lattices of 12-tone JI scales designed<br/>to maximize 7-limit tetradal harmony.</p><p>From that perspective, it surprises me that, given those<br/>interests, you&apos;re not more inclined toward serialism yourself.<br/>Seems to me like it would suit perfectly the manipulation of<br/>tetrads in a 12-tone JI scale.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
