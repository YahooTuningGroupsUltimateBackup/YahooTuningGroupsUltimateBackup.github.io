It took a series of three tunings to get it<br/>right--I can just imagine what Harrison must have gone through with the<br/>Bose. I will begin composing with it this weekend as I get my footing<br/>with the new key arrangements but jeesh it sounds so darn good--The<br/>goddess of the caverns might even be pleased</p><p>I have a computer question</p><p>I have a 4 minute .wav file that logs in around 48 mbs is it possible to<br/>zip a wav so i can post it or send it out<br/>It is a randomly generated sine piece which was created w/ Csound<br/>any folks who would like the orc and sco let me know,though maybe Dante<br/>already had the chance on the C list<br/> ciao<br/>Pat</p></div>
