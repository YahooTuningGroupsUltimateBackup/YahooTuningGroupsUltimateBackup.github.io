See <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hales/countdown/">http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hales/countdown/</a></p><p>But Gauss had proved in the 19th century that this way of packing spheres is<br/>most efficient among lattice packings, and it is doubtful that a non-lattice<br/>packing would find application in music theory . . .</p><p>Known as the &quot;face-centered cubic&quot; configuration of spheres, it has the same<br/>efficiency as the &quot;hexagonal close&quot; configuration, which has only two<br/>staggered positions of the triangular grid rather than three. An infinite<br/>number of ways of combining the three staggered positions of the triangular<br/>grid exist, and they all have the same efficiency. Efficiency, by the way,<br/>is defined as the proportion of the volume that is inside the spheres.</p><p>Getting back to the original configuration, any sphere and the 12 spheres<br/>touching it form a cuboctahedron corresponding to the 13 notes of the<br/>Partchian 7-limit tonality diamond (the central sphere is the 1/1). Erv<br/>Wilson used this correspondence long ago, and the way he, I, and many people<br/>on this list draw the 7-limit tonality diamond is identical to the way<br/>Buckminster Fuller drew his &quot;vector equilibrium&quot; (see<br/><a href="http://euch3i.chem.emory.edu/proposal/www.servtech.com/public/rwgray/synerge">http://euch3i.chem.emory.edu/proposal/www.servtech.com/public/rwgray/synerge</a><br/>tics/s04/figs/f1301.html for this and how it arises from sphere packing). If<br/>you &quot;mash&quot; the spheres in this packing together, each sphere gets deformed<br/>into a rhombic dodecahedron.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.treasure-troves.com/math/SpherePacking.html">http://www.treasure-troves.com/math/SpherePacking.html</a> for more --<br/>notice the &quot;Stella Octangula&quot; which corresponds in to Wilson&apos;s Stellated<br/>Hexany.</p></div>
