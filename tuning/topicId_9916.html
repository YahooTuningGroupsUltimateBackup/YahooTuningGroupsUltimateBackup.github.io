D&apos;e. -</p><p>I think you may actually have almost all the info you need. Let&apos;s suppose<br/>you&apos;re going to use a scale length of 650mm. Divide 650 by 1.05. Your first<br/>fret would be 619.04761905mm - call it 619.0 unless you&apos;re using an<br/>electron microscope - from the bridge, or 650.0 - 619.0 = 31.0mm from the<br/>nut. _Ordinarily, you&apos;d continue on that way, plugging the answer of each<br/>division into the next, thus:</p><p>619.04761905 / 1.05 = 589.569161, the 2nd fret position;<br/>589.569161   / 1.05 = 561.49443905, the 3rd fret position;<br/>561.49443905 / 1.05 = 534.75660861, etc.</p><p>Of course, your problem is different, and I don&apos;t know whether you have to<br/>divide 619.04761905 by your next ratio of frequencies, or if you have to go<br/>back and start with 650mm again, and run through the math until you get to<br/>the fret you&apos;re figuring out. That is, if your ratio for the 2nd fret were<br/>1.065, you&apos;d figure:</p><p>650 / 1.065 = 610.3286385, the 1st fret position, which we ignore, except<br/>to<br/>                                plug it into the next calculation:<br/>610.3286385 / 1.065 = 573.0785338, the 2nd fret position, the one we&apos;re<br/>after.</p><p>After all this, sadly, you have to compensate all your figures. We&apos;ve been<br/>assuming that nut, frets and bridge are in a plane. Of course they&apos;re not.<br/>When the player depresses the string, the vibrating length of the string<br/>lies at an angle from the _top of the bridge _down to the plane of the<br/>fretboard, or more precisely, the plane of the tops of the frets. The<br/>string length is the hypotenuse of a very skinny right triangle whose other<br/>sides are that ideal length you just spent so much time calculating, and<br/>the height from the top-of-fret plane to the top of the bridge. You could<br/>do all that math, too, and after you did, you might want to consider that<br/>when the string is depressed, it stretches. Or you might not.</p><p>Hope this doesn&apos;t leave you more depressed than the string.</p><p>BTW, I&apos;ve been known to spout off before I really know what I&apos;m talking<br/>about - if anyone out there would care to check both my theory and the<br/>practicality of it all, I&apos;d much appreciate it.</p><p>- Chris Parker,<br/>  St. Paul, MN USA</p></div><h3>James C.

The method assumes<br/>constant elasticity, which may not be true for nonmetal strings.

Before I go ahead, purchase<br/>a blank fretboard, and bring out the hacksaw, I want to make certain<br/>that I am placing frets correctly. I want to produce the notes I have<br/>on paper as exactly as I can. I know there much contemplation on this<br/>topic. I need someone to summarize all the errors that occur in<br/>stringed instruments, and how to diminish them. Here&apos;s what I know:</p><p>1. A string has mass. Therefore it&apos;s total length is shorter than it<br/>measures. This is because it is more rigid the closer it reaches both<br/>fulcrums. It doesn&apos;t vigbrate freely.</p><p>2. A string has tension. Depressing a string causes it&apos;s tension to<br/>increase, causing errors in intonation.</p><p>Someone said that I am able to measure the frets to &quot;perfect world<br/>conditions&quot; and then simply adjust the bridge to compensate for<br/>intonation errors. I need some conformation.</p><p>I have seen replacement guitar nuts, that are not straight. Earvana<br/>is one company that pushes this product as an intonation solver.</p><p>Another company named Dingwall, makes bass guitars with something<br/>called a fanned fret system. They have extented the low bass string,<br/>so that the frets change angle along the entire neck. They have done<br/>this both to improve intonation and tone quality. What is a good<br/>string length per diameter?</p><p>There is much to understand here. If anybody can straighten me out,<br/>it would be appreciated.</p><p>ps.
