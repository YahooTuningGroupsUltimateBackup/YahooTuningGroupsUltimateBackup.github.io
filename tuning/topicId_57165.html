May I say it is a pleasure<br/>to read. But it is way too short! :)</p><p>For one thing the paper doesn&apos;t explain how one derives the<br/>generators of the temperament from the vanishing commas. I have no<br/>idea how to do that and some kind of explanation would&apos;ve been nice.<br/>It is pretty straightforward (at least with a computer) to find the<br/>optimal (for example TOP) generators when you know how the<br/>generators are mapped to primes. But I want to know how to get the<br/>generator mappings from the comma list.</p><p>I understand that the math involved might&apos;ve been too complicated to<br/>be included in the paper.</p><p>P.S. In the paper there is a list of 5-prime-limit ratios of<br/>Harmonic Distance less than 6. I think the ratios 9/4, 5/2, 15/2 and<br/>27/1 are missing from that list.</p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=57169 href="#57169">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2005 11:35:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul&apos;s new paper was in my mailbox at 4th of February so it has<br/>been<br/>&gt; enriching my life for almost a month now.</p><p>Glad to hear it.</p><p>&gt; May I say it is a pleasure<br/>&gt; to read.</p><p>Why thank you!</p><p>&gt;But it is way too short! :)</p><p>John Chalmers was very generous for allowing me that many pages in<br/>his journal.
