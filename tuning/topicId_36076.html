Pitch discrimination is not just a matter of cent differences.<br/>2. Pitch discrimination varies over the range of human hearing, and is worse<br/>in both high and low registers, and is optimal in the band where speech<br/>occurs.<br/>3. Intonation variability in performance on any non-fixed pitch instrument,<br/>which is just about anything except keyboards electronic and acoustic, and<br/>possibly the organ.</p><p>I&apos;d like to see anyone hear differences of 1-4 cent in a passage of<br/>semiquavers played Allegro.</p><p>Tell me, has anyone studied the effect of tuning variance on &apos;passage work&apos;<br/>as strings call that sort of thing? IMHO, I think that discussion of minor<br/>pitch differences can only occur where the listener has time and the<br/>acoustic surroundings to focus on the note(s) in question. It&apos;s a bit like<br/>the difference between jumping off a high building and measuring gravity in<br/>a lab; in one you feel the acceleration, but don&apos;t give a damn about how<br/>much, the other you can spend time worring about accuracy and don&apos;t give a<br/>damn about how it feels.</p><p>Mark</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Reply-To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: 1 Apr 2002 00:16:17 -0000<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 1992<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; even want to call {1/n cents | n is a non-zero integer} a scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gene!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that&apos;s a good point. Is there any serious consideration that<br/>&gt; people would want to make scales that consisted of pitches less than<br/>&gt; a cent?  It seems people can&apos;t even really decide if people can<br/>&gt; actually hear and reproduce one cent... ??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jp<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
