This audible<br/>reality on the guitar that I recently fretted (with some sweet<br/>neutral intervals), led me to consider this from a sort of<br/>Pythagorean angle. Below are the ratios for a possible fretting<br/>pattern, with Scala data included, which, at least theoretically<br/>attempts to address the issue (an ancient concept applied to our<br/>contemporary needs). The appeal of this fretting is that one would be<br/>able to play in-tune fourths and fifths from nearly all starting<br/>points with a perpendicular fretting scheme, and would be equally<br/>effective with either an open 5ths or open 4ths tuning. This would<br/>seem to have some value in the quest for the just guitar.</p><p>Some noteworthy qualities:<br/>Scale is strictly proper<br/>Scale is a Constant Structure<br/>Most common intervals                : 4/3, 498.0450 cents &amp; inv.,<br/>amount: 9<br/>Number of recognizable fifths        : 11, average 701.933 cents</p><p>Guitar Fretting (Pythagorean) - Ligon 12-2000<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:         59/56             90.346<br/>  2:          9/8             203.910 major whole tone<br/>  3:         32/27            294.135 Pythagorean minor third<br/>  4:         81/64            407.820 Pythagorean major third<br/>  5:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth<br/>  6:         84/59            611.609<br/>  7:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/>  8:        128/81            792.180 Pythagorean minor sixth<br/>  9:         27/16            905.865 Pythagorean major sixth<br/> 10:         16/9             996.090 Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 11:        112/59           1109.654<br/> 12:          2/1            1200.000 octave<br/>|<br/>Number of notes                      : 12<br/>Smallest interval                    : 256/243, 90.2250 cents<br/>Average interval (divided octave)    : 100.000 cents<br/>Average / Smallest interval          : 1.108340<br/>Largest interval of one step         : 2187/2048, 113.6850 cents<br/>Largest / Average interval           : 1.136850<br/>Largest / Smallest interval          : 1.260017<br/>Least squares average interval       : 100.2196 cents<br/>Median interval of one step          : 59/56, 90.3458 cents<br/>Most common interval of one step     : 256/243, 90.2250 cents,<br/>amount: 4<br/>Interval standard deviation          : 11.5049 cents<br/>Interval skew                        :-0.0004 cents<br/>Scale is strictly proper<br/>Scale has monotonic third-sizes over circle of fifths<br/>Scale is a Constant Structure<br/>Number of different intervals        : 40 = 3.63636 / class<br/>Smallest interval difference         : 14337/14336, 0.1208 cents<br/>Most common intervals                : 4/3, 498.0450 cents &amp; inv.,<br/>amount: 9<br/>Number of recognizable fifths        : 11, average 701.933 cents<br/>Most common triad is 0.0 498.045 701.955 cents, amount: 7<br/>Rothenberg stability                 : 1.000000 = 1<br/>Lumma stability                      : 0.785755<br/>Prime limit                          : 59<br/>Odd number limit                     : 6561 (O: 2187 U: 6561)<br/>Fundamental                          : 1/2140992,-21.030 octaves,<br/>0.000 Hz.<br/>Guide tone                           : 4281984, 22.030 octaves,<br/>1120276484.61 Hz.<br/>Exponens Consonantiae                : 9.167693E+12, 43.0597 octaves<br/>Euler&apos;s gradus suavitatis            : 158<br/>Wille&apos;s k value                      : 1354846<br/>Vogel&apos;s harmonic complexity          : 80.58333<br/>Wilson&apos;s harmonic complexity         : 156<br/>Rectangular lattice diameter         : 12<br/>Triangular lattice diameter          : 8<br/>Prime exponents&apos; range and average:<br/>  2:  -6 ..  7    0.66667<br/>  3:  -4 ..  4    0.08333<br/>  7:  -1 ..  1    0.08333<br/> 59:  -1 ..  1   -0.08333<br/>Average exponent except of 2         : 0.08333<br/>Average absolute exponent except of 2: 27 / 12 = 2.25000<br/>Inversional symmetry on intervals    :<br/> 3-4 9-10<br/>Average distance from equal tempered   : 6.3653 cents, 0.063652 steps<br/>Standard deviation from equal tempered : 2.1330 cents, 0.021329 steps<br/>Maximum distance from equal tempered   : 11.6092 cents, 0.116092 steps<br/>Geometric average of pitches  0..n  : 600.893 cents<br/>Arithmetic average of pitches 0..n  : 40315465/27832896, 641.4508<br/>cents<br/>Harmonic average of pitches   0..n  : 560.335 cents<br/>Geometric average of pitches  1..n-1: 601.055 cents<br/>Arithmetic average of pitches 1..n-1: 33892489/23550912, 630.2192<br/>cents<br/>Harmonic average of pitches   1..n-1: 571.892 cents<br/>Geometric average of pitches  1..n  : 650.967 cents<br/>Arithmetic average of pitches 1..n  : 38174473/25691904, 685.5533<br/>cents<br/>Harmonic average of pitches   1..n  : 616.382 cents</p><p>Any opinions?
