The notes say that composer Annie &quot;Gosfield... requires the pianist and cellist to detune their instruments very specifically and precisely to perform her work, which was written in 1997.&quot; Also in the same program is Lou Harrison&apos;s Suite for Cello and Harp, but I don&apos;t know whether that&apos;s in a standard tuning or not; the notes just say that Harrison is &quot;no stranger to non-traditional tunings&quot;. Finally, it includes &quot;Michael Harrison&apos;s Night Vigil for harmonic piano &lt;<a href="http://www.michaelharrison.com/harmonic-piano.html">http://www.michaelharrison.com/harmonic-piano.html</a>&gt;, a seven-foot grand Harrison altered in order to facilitate alternative tunings.&quot;</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div>
