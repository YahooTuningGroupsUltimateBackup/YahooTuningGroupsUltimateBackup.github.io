I know he&apos;s got<br/>access to Darreg&apos;s guitars, and Denny said<br/>&quot;He&apos;s definitely one of the most accomplished and experienced.&quot;</p><p>Anyone care to fill me in ?<br/>Is Jonathan Glasier on the list ?</p><p>- Drew</p><p>No, Jonathan is not on the list.  I&apos;ve known him for a full 20 years, and while he plays an amazing array of instruments including, cello, recorder, keyboards, purcussion of all sorts, every instrument of Partch and Darreg, and is a most accomplished harmonic singer, he is also very comfortable with guitar. He taught classical and folk guitar in the San Diego schools for many years, and casually picks on one at every oportunity. His favorite microtonal guitar is in 19 tone Equal temperament, but he is competent in just intonation and 22tet, and can quickly swing into gear on any other guitar he gets his hands on, including lap steel, megalyra, ukulele...</p><p>He has one of the original replaceable frettboard guitars from Tom Stone, as well as one of the improved models distributed by Mark Rankin.<br/>There is a picture of him with a 19 tone guitar on the SonicArts website.</p><p>- - -</p><p>On another subject, I&apos;m still catching up on personal and business matters after my move from Florida to California. I&apos;m here on behalf of World Harmony Project to help establish a Just Intonation Center on the West Coast. Hope to bring y&apos;all up to date on this soon.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Denny Genovese</p></div><h3><a id=659 href="#659">ðŸ”—</a>dante rosati &#x3C;dante@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/1999 3:34:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Denny G wrote, about Glasier:</p><p>&gt;.
