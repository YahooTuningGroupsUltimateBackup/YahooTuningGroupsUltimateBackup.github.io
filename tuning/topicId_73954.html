After checking out the  canines in Schlick, I<br/>found some variance in the  calculations.<br/>Firstly, there are indeed 2  dogs in Schlick&rsquo;s temperament, not one.  The<br/>larger dog is from C# to G# at 711 cents according to Lindley&rsquo;s  numbers, and the<br/>smaller dog is three cents sharp from just between G# and  D#, as exists on<br/>the Halberstadt keyboard.<br/>J. Murray Barbour found  different values for Schlick, making the smaller dog<br/>a bit bigger at four cents  sharp of just.  With all other  fifths flatter<br/>than just, this smaller dog is even more noticeable.  This is the reason I<br/>consider Schlick an  irregular tuning musician, someone that relished a variety of<br/>keys, is that  I read this about him.  Sadly, I do  not know of a full<br/>translation for Schlick.  (It really is hard to trust second and  third hand<br/>sources.)<br/>And Fischer, too, had only  20 ueable keys that were easily distinguishable<br/>with 2 dogs.  And  Werckmeister IV/Trost as well.  In contrast, meantone is<br/>indistinguishable in chord function interval quality,  with only non-harmonic<br/>tones providing color/or meantone variant distinction as  per Tom.  My sense is<br/>that meantone  provides the greatest real impetus to ET, while deriving as well<br/>from a  homogenization of well temperaments, while taking the ultimate<br/>advantage of the  properties of the number 12, and the development of the modern<br/>piano.<br/>But back in the Baroque,  there seems to have been rival aesthetics, one<br/>leading to equalness and one in  praise of variegation.  Such a  perspective<br/>reshuffles the deck with ramifications for new analyses.   Frankly, it is<br/>enthomusicologically sound to derive the irregular variegation  principle share by<br/>Grammateus, Trost, Werckmeister, Kirnberger, and J.S.  Bach to the Thuringian/Harz<br/>environs of central Germany.<br/>I loved the use of dog and  goat intervals in your writing.  It makes  for<br/>easier reading and understanding.  Using this turn of speech, I guess the major<br/>third in C# major in sixth comma meantone at 416 cents  is a goat third,<br/>because it bleets.  How about the large major second in that same key, at 220<br/>cents; perhaps  it is a frog second because it jumps higher?<br/>A friend, John Sprague,  brought up some fairy tales dealing with wolves that<br/>might invite a metaphor to  music, The Three Little Pigs with the blowing<br/>down of the harmony of the triad  of pigs, for example.  Dogs nip at  the heels,<br/>they are not invisible, and really cannot be humored beyond their  nature.<br/>Yes, I do appreciate  Barnes&rsquo;s work.  Jorgensen has done a  lot of good, but<br/>I don&rsquo;t understanding how he could mislead listeners to Anthony  Newman&rsquo;s<br/>harpsichord performance of The Well-tempered Clavier by describing the  tuning as<br/>Aron-Neidhardt II, rather than as Kirnberger III.  As to no one tuning<br/>accurate ET in the  Baroque, how about Neidardt doing so quite publicly in Jena in<br/>1703, using a  monochord.  (Where there&rsquo;s one  there&rsquo;s many.)<br/>Back to meantone  alternatives, it is the variegation of the harmonic notes<br/>of keys that  distinguished the irregular tunings.  Even though these irregular<br/>tunings (to include both Grammateus  and Schlick) have different derivations,<br/>the ear only hears the variety  of harmonic connections in irregulars.  With<br/>every key a different sounding  tuning, no one can tell them apart!<br/>It was funny to read today  in a biography of Frederick the Great how<br/>horrified the King was  of the irregulars on the other side in war.  In his meantone<br/>court, the soldiers were  clearly intended to be regular.  As you may know,<br/>Quantz built meantone  distinctive keys into his new flutes/ D#-Eb, for example<br/>has a different key for  each chromatic identity.<br/>Margo, you might want to  revisit your idea that &ldquo;If we see a fifth Ab-Eb, I&rsquo;<br/>d take that as a hint that  the piece is intended for an instrument which<br/>actually has both notes!&rdquo;  This is exactly true, unless it is a  circular well<br/>temperament, and of course, 12-tET.  Werckmeister was explicit,  though, that<br/>chromatics like Eb and D# were to be intended as enharmonic  identities, while<br/>recognizing it might not take.  Obviously, I think is  ideas took big time,<br/>contrary to some on this List.<br/>I guess I don&rsquo;t care for  the very idea of modified meantone.  It creates a<br/>hazy distinction between  the 2 categories I am looking at.  It&apos;s<br/>understandable that there were  individuals that tuned every which way.  However, I am<br/>against imaginative contemporary interpretations as akin to  the way<br/>anthropologists whitewashed their studies of native American  music.<br/>It was quite enjoyable  reading your thoughts.<br/>All best, Johnny  Reinhard</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2007 10:38:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; But back in the Baroque,  there seems to have been rival aesthetics,<br/>one<br/>&gt; leading to equalness and one in  praise of variegation.

Actually, except for very few  treatises, I<br/>do have, and have read as many early writings as available.

Feel free to focus on the one you  mentioned.</p><p>PP:  And as Neidhardt said, the wind instruments were not built  in<br/>ET either, which created a conflict.</p><p>JR:  While a modern publishing of Neidhardt&apos;s writing is not  available,<br/>though I am hunting it down, I do know a thing or two about wind  instruments.

If you want to stick to  the Linnaeus categories<br/>of life, feel free, but it is dated.  DNA has  changed things around.<br/>Microtonality has allowed the mind to understand  differently than people did in the<br/>past.  My experiences 25 years ago with  tuning were quite different than they<br/>are now.

Neidhardt and Bach<br/>were born in the same year. Neidhardt spent his early adult years in<br/>Jena, where he studied with JN Bach, who reportedly had a new organ<br/>there tuned in one of Neidhardt&apos;s temperaments. This puts him smack<br/>dab in the middle of Bach territory, both in terms of geography and<br/>professional contacts. Even if we want to restrict ourselves to the<br/>rather unlikely prospect that the only communication between N and JSB<br/>was by means of N&apos;s published tracts, his first publication was while<br/>he was still in Jena, in 1706.

Maybe we should have a sheep second that baaahhs at 220  cents.</p><p>We seem to have covered some good area, although there would be no new<br/>writing if everything was settled.  For example the poodle at 4 cents  sharp of<br/>just is not yet so finalized for the following reason: the  distance heard and<br/>perceived between it and the other fifths in the system is  still greater, than<br/>it is &quot;theoretically&quot; from just.  With fifths of 696  cents in a system, a<br/>poodle might well be considered to be at 8 cents.</p><p>Calling the poodle a four cents &quot;gentle&quot; may not seem so to the  listener of<br/>the time, or in my case, to a listener of this time.  I do  believe that<br/>modern ears have been opened wide to the acceptance of new sounds  as legitimate<br/>musical materials and vocabulary, including most spectacularly,  noise.  Sure, 4<br/>cents seems modest, but at 8 cents difference and in  the opposite direction<br/>of just, it places itself as an irregular tuning that an  improvisor would<br/>adhere to.  The player of the time did improvise to shock,  as Bach was accused<br/>of doing in Arnstadt as a youth, or Charles Ives was accused  of in a church<br/>organist job he had as a youth.  Youthful indiscretion  aside, there was no<br/>advantage to procuring even a poodle to the ear when the  audience was not<br/>expecting dogs of any stripe.</p><p>Margo: Certainly I understand your point that both meantone and  12-tET<br/>provide uniform interval sizes as to the &quot;usual&quot; intervals, such<br/>as  regular major and minor thirds. As someone to whom &quot;modern&quot;<br/>often means  &quot;around 1600,&quot; I give weight to those &quot;unusual&quot;<br/>intervals, and to chromatic  progressions as well. From a<br/>perspective of 1750 or 1850, I can see your  point. Someone who<br/>likes the uniform sweetness of a meantone organ might  conclude<br/>that if we need a 12-note circulating system, let&apos;s at least  make<br/>everything as uniform as possible -- thus 12-tET.<br/>The next issue  raised was about my general comment that listening to</p><p>Johnny: Thank you for understanding me here, though I might start the<br/>perspective at 1700.  Once Werckmeister&apos;s ideas were widespread in  central Germany,<br/>the idea of an equal temperament became obvious.  As we  know, ideas can<br/>precede practice.  Neidhardt played out the idea most  dramatically in Jena.</p><p>Another question raised to my comment, Do you mean that given that<br/>Grammateus and Schlick are both<br/>variegated, no one can tell these two tunings  apart?, brought a fine<br/>response.  You do understand me, that I was speaking  generally.  If one trains the<br/>ear to look for distinctive features, and  maybe with a bit of perfect pitch<br/>ability, maybe, one could look for this like  testing for beats.  Your point is<br/>taken.

While I appreciate your honesty, we  disagree.  Kirnberger<br/>was used as a resource by no less than  Beethoven.  google &quot;Beethoven<br/>Kirnberger&quot; and read how Beethoven used  Kirnberger&apos;s book to teach his students near<br/>the latter part of his life.   Besides, Kirnberger&apos;s discussion of the minor<br/>seventh resolving down as a  distinctive harmonic functional dissonance is<br/>profound.  Additionally, his  description of variegation in well temperament as<br/>distinguished from ET is  profound.  His generosity in giving the world his<br/>copies of the Brandenburg  Concerti, and so much more makes him worthy of much more<br/>respect than you would  give him.  From a temperament point of view, he<br/>merely brought a more just  intonation bias to what had been done earlier.  I would<br/>agree that he shot  himself in the foot by claiming to represent his teacher,<br/>Bach, and then  substituting his own tuning in the beginning of the book.</p><p>PP:  Pythagorean definitely has it&apos;s<br/>place, I just  don&apos;t think the standard approach to teaching about<br/>&quot;scales&quot; as found in  dozens of acoustics books for musicians is valid:<br/>first Pythag, then Just,  then ET. This puts the cart before the horse,<br/>because JI preceded  Pythag.</p><p>JR:  That is not what you said before.  More measured,  I agree with you.<br/>Tracing Pythagorean to city dwellers in the connection that I  would make.<br/>Earth&apos;s original inhabitants seem to have an innate  understanding of just<br/>intonation, but it was Sumerians that introduced a spiral  of fifths.<br/>The neolithic had given way to the cities.</p><p>Also, maybe we disagree here, but I trust that music composed  in Pythagorean<br/>tuning would be more sincere than if it was transposed.  I  would say that,<br/>by extension, this is true for any music composed in a specific  tuning.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keyboard players could not change pitch  levels in<br/>&gt; circular well temperament, for instance. If it were possible  there<br/>would be no<br/>&gt; need for different pitch standards. Only meantone  allowed for such<br/>&gt; transposition.</p><p>PP:  Huh???!!!! I don&apos;t get  any of this. There was no &quot;need&quot; for different<br/>pitches, they just were, the  result of various preexistent conditions<br/>which had no origin in temperament.</p><p>JR: Yes, it is true, you do not get any of this. :)<br/>There are a number of reasons why there was a difference  between church<br/>organs and keyboards tuned for wind instruments like oboes  and bassoons.<br/>Firstly, woods sound better when they can be elongated  a bit (note the early music<br/>fixation on 415 herz).  This is why English  Horn and bass clarinet developed.<br/>Secondly, organ parts are  cheaper when the pipes are smaller.  Thirdly,<br/>higher pitch is symbolically  closer to God, angel like, for an instrument<br/>designed to get God&apos;s  attention.  Fourthly, there was no pitch standard, with<br/>pitches set at  different rates in different churches in the same city.  And there<br/>was no  standard of pitch between Chor and Kammer pitches.  A whole tone apart<br/>does  not tell anyone what kind of whole tone is intended.</p><p>PP:  I fail to understand how you think<br/>that  transposition by 1/2 step, often mentioned in late 17th and 18th<br/>treatises on  how to be a good organist, how to realize continuo, etc,<br/>is possible.</p><p>JR:  Somehow, your meaning is not clear here.  What  I am saying is that in<br/>well temperament re Bach changing a key from D minor to E  minor means that the<br/>intervallic values are different, so there is no smooth  transposition.  That<br/>is why Bach would re write the orchestra in St.  Matthew&apos;s Passion to reflect<br/>E minor, even though the organs parts were written  in D minor.  D minor was<br/>different than E minor is well temperament,  of which I use Werckmeister III<br/>as a model.  D minor is the most just minor  key in Werckmeister III and E<br/>minor is much more non-descript in this  context.  It is not a simple<br/>transposition.  Meantone, due to its  regularity is a natural for such transposition,<br/>however.</p><p>PP: I fail to understand how you think that transpositon  was<br/>not possible in circulating temperaments, when so many sources  say<br/>that is what they are for. Maybe you like the sound of howling  wolf<br/>thirds, but if I&apos;m gonna have to play in c# major or f# major,  I&apos;ll<br/>take a Neidhardt over meantone any day, no question!</p><p>JR: yes, you do not understand, but please don&apos;t put words in  my mouth.  I<br/>like Howling Wolf the blues artist.  But I am not radical  in my appreciations<br/>of early music.  Taking &quot;Neidhardt&quot; like the &quot;A Train&quot;  doesn&apos;t say very much.<br/> I am not a generalist.  I work to match the  tuning to the composer in a<br/>manner that reflects said composer&apos;s  intentions.  If a piece in meantone, say a<br/>work by Kuhnau, wants to  emphasize a wolf in meantone to demonstrate<br/>something in David and Goliath, I  would honor that.</p><p>&gt; PP: And as Neidhardt said, the wind instruments were  not built in<br/>&gt; ET either, which created a conflict.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  While a modern publishing of Neidhardt&apos;s writing is not available,</p><p>PP:  Try Tom Dent&apos;s wiki tuning page.</p><p>JR:  Thank you, I already have.  Thank you,  Tom.  (And by the way, I loved<br/>your recent post.)</p><p>&gt; though I am hunting it down, I do know a thing or  two about wind<br/>instruments. You<br/>&gt; might say that I can play in any  tuning on a bassoon or a recorder,<br/>even ET.</p><p>PP:  I have had  extensive exposure to players of early winds,</p><p>JR:  In this case you are second hand to the knowledge,  and I am first hand.<br/> There is intelligence gained in different ways.   It is interesting to<br/>suppose that what one can do in the present indicates it  could have been done in<br/>the past.  But I am not drawing and hard  conclusions.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, my work is based on<br/>&gt; Bach&apos;s tuning and  Neidhardt is late for Bach based on chronology.</p><p>PP: Once again, I can&apos;t  fathom what you are on about. Neidhardt and Bach<br/>were born in the same year.  Neidhardt spent his early adult years in<br/>Jena, where he studied with JN Bach,  who reportedly had a new organ<br/>there tuned in one of Neidhardt&apos;s  temperaments. This puts him smack<br/>dab in the middle of Bach territory, both  in terms of geography and<br/>professional contacts. Even if we want to restrict  ourselves to the<br/>rather unlikely prospect that the only communication between  N and JSB<br/>was by means of N&apos;s published tracts, his first publication was  while<br/>he was still in Jena, in 1706. Er, let&apos;s see now, by my  reckoning,<br/>that leaves a good 44 years of JSB output that could have  been<br/>influenced by N&apos;s ideas. I don&apos;t understand your concept of  chronos.<br/>Perhaps you could explain?</p><p>JR:  The chronology has JS  Bach at 18 years old adjudicating Wender&apos;s new<br/>organ in Arnstadt in a circular  well temperament, most likely in Werckmeister<br/>III tuning.  At this  time, Neidhardt was outside of Thuringia and a law<br/>student.  By the time  Neidhardt studies in Jena, JS Bach is already on his tuning<br/>path.  Changing  views for Neidhardt are of interest, and of course a changing<br/>course for Bach  would be of interest.  I do not think there is any profound<br/>change in  Bach&apos;s tuning preferences as of 18 years old in Arnstadt.  The Bach<br/>family, probably under the expertise Johann Christoph Bach in Eisenach, who<br/>died  just before the judging in Arnstadt, set the project up when JS was 16<br/>years  old.  I believe, and will produce this material supporting this belief,<br/>as  soon as I can in a book.</p><p>&gt; PP: I would go<br/>&gt; so far as to say that I  personally believe that mod means represent<br/>&gt; general practice for  anything but the big church organs for much of<br/>&gt; the 17th and 18th  centuries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: You may be speaking about mod in terms of  derivation, but I am<br/>focusing<br/>&gt; on the unequalness between keys that  Kirnberger and Werckmeister and<br/>many<br/>&gt; others wrote about as an  aesthetic. Feel free to continue to<br/>ignore this, but it<br/>&gt; is in their  writings.</p><p>PP:  I&apos;m not ignoring it all, and I&apos;m quite familiar with  many texts citing<br/>it.</p><p>JR:  Ah, that wasn&apos;t clear.</p><p>PP: What I doubt is that there was a conflicting aesthetic  that<br/>preferred the sound of ET.</p><p>JR:  Me, too.  But there were those that preferred  the sound of meantone, as<br/>opposed to irregular tunings (which you prefer to call  modified meantone).</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2007 11:18:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: Hello Paul.  While I appreciate your honesty, we  disagree.<br/>Kirnberger<br/>&gt; was used as a resource by no less than  Beethoven.  google &quot;Beethoven<br/>&gt; Kirnberger&quot; and read how Beethoven used  Kirnberger&apos;s book to teach<br/>his students near<br/>&gt; the latter part of his life.</p><p>I did, but I didn&apos;t see anything on the first few pages that came up.<br/>If you have some URL, why not just post it instead of sending people<br/>on a wild goose chase?</p><p>Kinrnberger&apos;s KRS is a big work covering lots of stuff. I don&apos;t doubt<br/>Beethoven could have used some aspects of it. It&apos;s the temperament<br/>that I think is amateurish and of little or no practical value for<br/>music of &gt;1780. Most especially Beethoven. And whenever I mention<br/>Kirnberger and temperament in the same breath, I mean his original<br/>temperament, the one with 1/2 comma fifths.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: Yes, it is true, you do not get any of this. :)<br/>&gt; There are a number of reasons why there was a difference  between<br/>church<br/>&gt; organs and keyboards tuned for wind instruments like oboes  and<br/>bassoons.<br/>&gt; Firstly, woods sound better when they can be elongated  a bit (note<br/>the early music<br/>&gt; fixation on 415 herz).</p><p>Woodwinds were built at many different pitches at many different<br/>times. They sound different, I hesitate to say &quot;better&quot;. Depends on<br/>what you are after; a mellow, warm sound, or a bright piquant sound.<br/>It just so happens that bassons and clarinets were largely of French<br/>origins, and French pitch was low. Early Dulcians and cornetti, on the<br/>other hand, were high.</p><p>&gt; Secondly, organ parts are  cheaper when the pipes are smaller.</p><p>This idea was floating around the Netherlands 15 years ago or so, but<br/>I don&apos;t know anybody who believes it. That&apos;s because any real savings<br/>would be next to nil. For a rise of a whole tone, the savings would<br/>amount to 11% of the material used in making the pipes only, which is<br/>a small fraction of the total material in the instrument when you<br/>think about windchests, keyboards, trackers, and most of all, the<br/>casework. Finally, then, as now, labor was by far the largest cost of<br/>making an instrument, and pitch does not change this one iota.<br/>Personally, I&apos;d be surprised if any organ builder factored pitch into<br/>the cost calculation - hardly worth the effort. Anybody got any hard<br/>data on that? I suppose Ibo would know if anybody did, he&apos;s probably<br/>seen more original organ contracts than any other person alive today.</p><p>&gt;  Thirdly,<br/>&gt; higher pitch is symbolically  closer to God, angel like, for an<br/>instrument<br/>&gt; designed to get God&apos;s  attention.</p><p>That&apos;s very creative, but it doesn&apos;t wash. Organs were originally<br/>pitched lower, in the old Chorton, when Cammerton was the higher of<br/>the two because of the cornetti. As cornetti began to be used more in<br/>churches, the organ were jacked up to agree with them. Only later did<br/>the two switch place. Did 16th musicians somehow feel less of a need<br/>to be close to God? Plus I don&apos;t think there is much stock in your<br/>suggestion that intent was &quot;to get God&apos;s attention&quot;. When we are<br/>dealing with an ostensibly omnipotent and omnipresent being, by<br/>definition you&apos;ve already got his attention. No, I suspect it was more<br/>so to put the FEAR of God into the church goers, and for that it<br/>merely needs to be loud.</p><p>&gt; Fourthly, there was no pitch standard, with<br/>&gt; pitches set at  different rates in different churches in the same<br/>city.  And there<br/>&gt; was no  standard of pitch between Chor and Kammer pitches.  A whole<br/>tone apart<br/>&gt; does  not tell anyone what kind of whole tone is intended.</p><p>That is more or less true but only when you want to pin it down to<br/>something as small as the difference between various believable whole<br/>sizes. This assertion is generally disproved by the number of<br/>instruments built with transposing keyboards (like the early 18th c<br/>Frankfurt cathedral organ, that could slide manuals and pedal by a<br/>minor third, making all half step stops along the way), and the truly<br/>vast number of sources talking about the organist needing to transpose<br/>up or down a whole tone in order to play with winds pitched<br/>differently. Or works like the Krebs Fantasy for organ and oboe, with<br/>the manuscript organ part written in f minor (!) and the oboe in g<br/>minor (could be a case of subsemitones). Finally, we have no less than<br/>two surviving letters by Silbermann to prospective clients advising<br/>them that they must decide which pitch they want the organ at<br/>(obviously they weren&apos;t feeling insecure about their distance to the<br/>Almighty, or there would have been no question) in which he describes<br/>all four pitches (from French Opera pitch to Cornetton) stating that<br/>they are separated by a half step.</p><p>Have you read Haynes/Story of A?</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div>
