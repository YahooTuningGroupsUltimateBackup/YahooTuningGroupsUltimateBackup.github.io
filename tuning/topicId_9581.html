As far as Partch and Helmholtz being slanted, I agree, that is why i tried to<br/>add a few others and welcomed Paul addition to mine ( although i have never seen it). i do<br/>believe that both for their times opened the field up more than they constricted it!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Joseph!<br/>&gt; &gt;     what does this mean- your publisher? does he own your music or something<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Kraig!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, yes... he owns the copyrights on ALL the music I give<br/>&gt; him, and he is an anti-microtonalist... I am sorry to have to report<br/>&gt; this.  He is a very independent soul... also somewhat of a right-winger,<br/>&gt; which I detest, but a nice athiest, which I rather admire...  He&apos;s an<br/>&gt; odd duck, that is for certain...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The arrangement is the same as most people have with &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>&gt; sheet-music publishers... The publisher owns the copyright and I get 10%<br/>&gt; of the proceeds which is, admittedly, not much.  This is the traditional<br/>&gt; &quot;deal&quot; over many, many years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So why do I give him any of my music?... Well, I can&apos;t handle it<br/>&gt; myself... by my nature, I would just give it away at my own expense.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a very poor capitalist, so I would rather have others do the &quot;dirty<br/>&gt; work&quot; for me... [In my own defense, however, I have to admit I &quot;sneak&quot;<br/>&gt; copies of my pieces to performers who can&apos;t afford to buy them through<br/>&gt; the publisher -- but no telly!]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Virtually ALL of my music now includes microtonality, and, in fact, the<br/>&gt; publisher has pieces that are EXTENSIVELY microtonal, and things are<br/>&gt; going along OK with these... HOWEVER, I am no longer giving him any<br/>&gt; pieces that are PARTICULARLY microtonal, especially of an &quot;experimental&quot;<br/>&gt; nature... since I might want to include these in SPECIFICALLY microtonal<br/>&gt; publications OR things like the Doty &quot;compilation cassettes or CDs&quot; that<br/>&gt; this publisher wouldn&apos;t allow due to his unfortunate and, I believe,<br/>&gt; misinformed bias...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the skoop...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JP<br/>&gt; _________ ______ ____ __ _<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
