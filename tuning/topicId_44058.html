One thing I&apos;ve concluded by<br/>playing around with this stuff is that in many ways, the idea put<br/>forward by Eytan and all the other equality purists really has the<br/>matter backwards. It&apos;s a practical solution, but not musically<br/>optimal; equality as such is boring and lifeless, and some<br/>differentiation is a good idea on aesthetic grounds. I&apos;ve been<br/>wondering how this applies to general temperament theory; the idea<br/>gives me a bit of a headache. How many things are out there, for<br/>varied base temperaments and number of scale degrees, which are<br/>analogous to the grail temperament, for instance?
