I put around the circle of fifths, amending thus<br/>Bach&apos;s  seal.  ( See</p><p><a href="http://ha.kellner.bei.t-online.de">http://ha.kellner.bei.t-online.de</a>   )</p><p>I stress, of course that I myself added my interpretation of the seal<br/>in form of the circle of fifths in my webpage. Please note that the seal<br/>does not contain any indication concerning the distribution of perfect<br/>and tempered fifths. The rationale for the graphic art in my website I<br/>shall thus present here, below.</p><p>It is striking that the crown of the signet holds 5 identical items of one<br/>sort and and other 7 identical items of another sort.<br/>Those I interpret rspectively as the 5 fifths &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; and the 7 perfect<br/>fifths.</p><p>Friedrich Smend suggested his interpretation: 5 rubis and 7 pearls. I feel<br/>this goes very well indeed with those two sorts of fifths. Who would, turned<br/>around, relate perfect fifths with Smend&apos;s rubis and tempered fifths with his<br/>pearls? Intuitively, nobody would do that!?</p><p>The system &quot;wohltemperirt&quot; of Werckmeister/Bach is based upon a TRIAD,<br/>musical symbol of the Holy Trinity - trias harmonica perfecta, about which<br/>Margot Schulter recently provided pertinent references to historical<br/>authors of writing treatises within the traditions of music-theory.</p><p>Below, at mark &iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;, I take the liberty<br/>to quote Margot Schulter&apos;s excellent essay concerning the<br/>trias harmonica perfecta I apprecaite and for which I am grateful.</p><p>Returning now  to &quot;Bach/wohltemperirt&quot;, the beats within the<br/>fundamental C-major triad , C-E and C-G, occur at the unison,<br/>at the perfection of the baroque &quot;unitas&quot;=UNITY. In Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>writings the argument about the unity&apos;s perfection steadily recurs.</p><p>The trefle crowning the seal can be associated with the<br/>TRINITY, the triad.<br/>The sort of lateral symmetry of the signet represents the UNITY<br/>ithe seal; this argument is not very strong, though. The center<br/>of the signet is made up from the letters JSB running from left<br/>top down to right bottom, intertwined with their mirror-image.</p><p>JSB utilized this seal - his second(!) one, after abandoning a first and<br/>earlier one - for the first time in 1722. This is at the same time the<br/>only number figuring at the autograph title of Das wohltemperirte Clavier.<br/>The number 1722 may be interpreted as belonging to wohltemperirt,<br/>representing as follows the</p><p>1 tempering fifth B-f#<br/>7 perfect fifths and two pairs of fifths &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;:<br/>2 fifths c-g-d together with<br/>2 fifths d-a-e.</p><p>Juxtaposing, will form  1722; striking!</p><p>The first document we posess, upon which Bach has employed his seal, in an<br/>administrative matter on heritages in the family, was found in an Erfurt<br/>archive.<br/>It is dated March 15th, 1722 - again the number of that year.<br/>The context of &quot;wohltemperirt&quot;, and written the German way, 15.3. 1722</p><p>1=UNITY<br/>5 fifth in thoroughbass<br/>3 third in thoroughbass</p><p>This can be interpreted as nothing else than the specification of the beat<br/>properties within the basic welltempered triad c-e-g.</p><p>The entire date, 15.3.1722, boldly juxtaposed as 1531722 has an<br/>interesting and surprising factorization - I shall mention later<br/>should nobody else submit it earlier.</p><p>The factorization - to whet the appetites - of<br/>1722 reads 1722=3*14*41<br/>                3 TRINY<br/>                  14 BACH<br/>                     41 J.S. BACH according to Henk dieben&apos;s number alphabet<br/>                                               and gematria.</p><p>In this context, all the bars, preludes and fugues of WTC I,<br/>altogether 48 numbers, do form a &quot;magic rectangle&quot;, 4*12, the sum<br/>of all 12 lines amounts to 174. Discovered by Henk Dieben!<br/>174: 1 tempering fifth B-f#, 7 perfect fifths, 4 ordinary fifths wohltemperirt.</p><p>Kellner, H.A.: Le temp&iuml;&iquest;&half;rament in&iuml;&iquest;&half;gal de Werckmeister/Bach et l&apos;alphabet<br/>num&iuml;&iquest;&half;rique de Henk Dieben.
