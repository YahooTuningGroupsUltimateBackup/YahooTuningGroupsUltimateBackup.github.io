If not, let me know and<br/>I&apos;ll do my best to provide other formats.</p><p>When I got this &quot;version&quot; home, I noticed that the basses had moved slightly<br/>sharp of the given piano pitch (C) likely causing the women&apos;s third to tune<br/>fairly close to the piano&apos;s E. However, when the tenors&apos; fifth is added, it<br/>seems to influence the women&apos;s third to the extent that when the piano&apos;s E<br/>is sounded again, it appears to have &quot;sunk.&quot; Since that is not likely, the<br/>conclusion must be the the women&apos;s third has risen, presumably because of<br/>the addition of the tenors&apos; fifth to the mix.</p><p>Questions? Responses? Rational explanations? Acoustic or psychoacoustic? All<br/>opinions are welcome. No theories to be &quot;proven&quot; here. Only a repeatable<br/>observation to be understood.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>P.S.: Now that I have &quot;mastered&quot; the skills needed for posting mp3&apos;s, I<br/>would like to share a number of clips showing what sound like &quot;high thirds&quot;<br/>to me in actual performances. Give me a week, please. (Yeah! Sure!)</p></div><h3><a id=8677 href="#8677">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2000 5:25:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve listened to the demo quite closely and also tried to run some<br/>spectrogram FFTs on it.

Also, I<br/>find that the piano tones interfere with the performance. The fifth partial<br/>of the initial piano tone is noticeably stretched above a 5:1.
