Theory of Harmony, Vienna 1911, University of<br/>California Press, 1983,<br/>p. 314.<br/>Until a short time before [musicians] had been on the  right track, as,<br/>following the dictates \of the material, they imitated the  overtones.  But<br/>then they tempered  the system, and the system tempered the burning urgency to<br/>search.  They had concluded a truce.  But they did not rest (rasten) in<br/>order to rearm and regroup  (r&uuml;sten); they rested in order to  rust (rosten).<br/>The tempered system was an emergency  measure, and an ingenious one, for the<br/>emergency was grave and the measure  ample.  It was an ingenious<br/>simplification, but it was a makeshift.  No one, having wings, would rather fly in an<br/>airplane.  The airplane is also an ingenious  makeshift; but if we could fly<br/>merely by an act of will, we should gladly do  without the machine.  We<br/>ought never  to forget that the tempered system was only a truce, which should<br/>not last any  longer than the imperfection of our instruments requires.  We<br/>ought not to forget that e still must  account for the tones actually<br/>sounding, again and again, and shall have no rest  from them nor from ourselves &ndash;<br/>especially from ourselves, for we are the  searchers, the restless, who will<br/>not tire before we have found out --  we shall have no rest, as long as we<br/>have not solved the problems that are contained in tones.  We may indeed<br/>always be barred from  actual attainment of this goal.  But  more certainly,<br/>we shall have no rest before we do; the searching spirit will  not stop<br/>pursuing these problems until it has solved them, solved them in a way  that<br/>comes as close as anyone can to actual solution.  I thin, then, contrary to the<br/>point of  view of those who take indolent pride in the attainments of others<br/>and hold our  system to be the ultimate, the definitive musical system &ndash;<br/>contrary to that  point of view, I think we stand only at the Beginning.  We<br/>must go ahead! (Arnold Schoenberg,  Theory of Harmony, p. 314)<br/>JR</p></div>
