Can you mayhap suggest proportional beating<br/>scenarios<br/>&gt; for my 79 tone proposal?</p><p>Actually, I could try. The only thing which complicates the matter a bit is<br/>the large number of tones. FYI, the 12-tone system took me almost two days<br/>to develop into the final form. :-D<br/>I was very lucky, as I&apos;ve said, as there is another very similar meantone<br/>which DOES have these properties by itself (you can find more about these<br/>synchronous types of meantone in message 62320). Another problem is that I<br/>do these things just by hand and head as I haven&apos;t found an universal method<br/>for finding similar beat rates in scales. If I managed to find one, then I<br/>could try to make a small utility which could do these tasks for me much<br/>faster. Even more, neither do I have a 79-tone keyboard nor a 79-tone &quot;way<br/>of keyboard thinking&quot;, which makes it impossible for me to prove if my<br/>assumptions here or there are right. But if I managed to find something like<br/>a common kind of procedure for all of these tunings, maybe things could<br/>change. Maybe when I finish my second year at school in June, then I can<br/>think about the question of such a procedure which could be easily<br/>transcribed into a small piece of code. Sadly, as I&apos;m not a great<br/>programmer, I always write my software for the old-fashioned QBasic which<br/>runs under MSDos. So if I wanted to give such a program to you, for example,<br/>someone would have to rewrite it into a more usual form beforehand.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
