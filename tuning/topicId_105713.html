Someone needs to do a developmental psychology<br/>&gt;  PhD and [DEL: subject scores of infants to :DEL] gift<br/>&gt;  scores of infants with various tunings.</p><p>Thank you for a very logical and fair question, based on my<br/>quoted comment, which gives me the opportunity to clarify my<br/>point of view and inquire a bit into just where my remarks<br/>were coming from in preferring the Pythagorean version.</p><p>My conclusion is that 22-EDO could be a pleasant<br/>&quot;modernistic&quot; variation on 14th-century intonation, and<br/>indeed a rather &quot;moderate&quot; express of one facet of the<br/>historical style. The issue, from the viewpoint of a<br/>&quot;classic&quot; or &quot;historically oriented&quot; performance, is not so<br/>much a 436-cent major third or 55-cent semitone step, but<br/>the tempering out of 64/63.</p><p>In these terms, a &quot;classic&quot; performance might take one of at<br/>least two approaches:</p><p>    (1) Simply using regular intervals in Pythagorean<br/>        intonation or some temperament not too far from it,<br/>        say with fifths within 2 cents or so of just; or</p><p>    (2) Using regular Pythagorean or near-Pythagorean<br/>        intervals through most of a piece, but with<br/>        &quot;exuberant&quot; intonation at cadences, especially those<br/>        involving sharps, with major thirds and sixths at<br/>        around 7:9:12 or even larger, and cadential semitone<br/>        or diesis steps around 28:27 or even narrower.</p><p>For an example of the second option, based on the theory of<br/>Marchettus of Padua (1318), here is an improvisation:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>If indeed, as scholars such as Jay Rahn have suggested based<br/>on a monochord interpretation of Marchettus, a cadential<br/>sonority such as E-G#-C# may have been intoned at somewhere<br/>around 37:48:64 (0-451-949 cents), with steps at about 37/36<br/>or 47 cents, then 22-EDO might actually be more of &quot;a bridge<br/>not quite far enough.&quot;</p><p>In practice, I tend to read Marchettus as leaving the way<br/>open for E-G#-C# or the like at around 7:9:12, with steps<br/>around a typically &quot;tempered&quot; 28/27, which in my practice<br/>means mostly &quot;somewhere around 55-59 cents,&quot; or in other<br/>words not at all far from the 55-cent steps of 22-EDO, _at<br/>cadences_, that is!</p><p>Here&apos;s an example:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/O_Europae.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Note the cadences at around 0:24-0:26 (mm. 17-18), 0:33-0:35<br/>(mm. 23-24), 0:42-0:44 (mm. 29-30), and 0:49-0:52<br/>(mm. 34-35) involving steps of 58.6 cents and large major<br/>thirds at 437.1 or 438.3 cents. The second instance involves<br/>~6:7:9, and the others ~7:9:12. These intonations themselves<br/>hardly differ radically from 22-EDO.</p><p>Where 22-EDO differs from such &quot;classic&quot; or more<br/>specifically &quot;Marchettan&quot; approaches is in tempering out the<br/>64/63, so that all regular semitones are at 55 cents, for<br/>example. What I&apos;d emphasize is that while this might not be<br/>a classic 14th-century approach, that doesn&apos;t mean that it<br/>isn&apos;t a good modernistic one!</p><p>In fact, I routinely have played tempered Archytan<br/>tetrachords in tunings like 207.4-57.4-232.0 cents, or even<br/>216.8-50.3-224.6 cents. Here I&apos;m not going for some special<br/>effect or intended artistic distortion, but simply accepting<br/>some interval in a given temperament structure as<br/>&quot;equivalent&quot; to 28/27 at 63 cents. So 218.2-54.5-218.2 cents<br/>in 22-EDO hardly seems a bridge further than these examples!</p><p>And I would emphasize that while a &quot;historically oriented&quot;<br/>performance of Machaut should probably observe the 64/63 or<br/>whatever if one does choose to use Marchettan inflections,<br/>from a modern perspective 22-EDO is a very reasonable choice<br/>for this kind of style, and one illustrating the qualities<br/>of the tuning as a regular diatonic system. Especially if<br/>the timbres minimize any conspicuous beating of stable<br/>fifths and fourths, as evidently happened in Chris&apos;s<br/>example, there&apos;s no reason it might not be used, and used<br/>effectively in a (neo)medieval context!</p><p>Finally, I would warmly agree that custom and habit can play<br/>a big role in how a given tuning is perceived. About four<br/>decades back, one very justly noted scholar of medieval<br/>European music wrote that early music ensembles were not<br/>using Pythagorean tuning because presumably they wished not<br/>to be criticized for faulty intonation! The experiment you<br/>describe could be a very interesting one.</p><p>&gt; JBSL</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2013 6:54:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter  wrote:</p><p>&gt; For an example of the second option, based on the theory of<br/>&gt; Marchettus of Padua (1318), here is an improvisation:</p><p>Very striking piece!

Why don&apos;t I give a Scala file and listing,<br/>and also an article by Jay Rahn on Marchettus of Padua proposing an<br/>interpretation very close to this tuning.</p><p>While the tuning that follows was designed specifically to yield some<br/>pure sonorities of 14:17:21 and the like, it&apos;s more generally intended<br/>for the kind of &quot;Marchettan&quot; intonation heard in this piece. The<br/>cadential diesis steps are 48.230 cents, which happens to be very<br/>close to Jay Rahn&apos;s monochord interpretation of Marchettus with these<br/>steps around 37:36 or 47.434 cents. Rahn&apos;s reading is based on a<br/>division of a 9/8 or 81/72 tone into 81:79:77:76:74:72, with 74/72 or<br/>37/36 as a possible value for the cadential diesis as &quot;one of the five<br/>parts of a tone.&quot;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.98.4.6/mto.98.4.6.rahn.html">http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.98.4.6/mto.98.4.6.rahn.html</a>&gt;</p><p>|<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        459/448            41.995<br/>  2:       2187/2048          113.685 apotome<br/>  3:    1003833/917504        155.680<br/>  4:          9/8             203.910 major whole tone<br/>  5:       4131/3584          245.905<br/>  6:         32/27            294.135 Pythagorean minor third<br/>  7:         17/14            336.130 supraminor third<br/>  8:         81/64            407.820 Pythagorean major third<br/>  9:      37179/28672         449.815<br/> 10:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth<br/> 11:        153/112           540.040<br/> 12:        729/512           611.730 Pythagorean tritone<br/> 13:     334611/229376        653.725<br/> 14:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth<br/> 15:       1377/896           743.950<br/> 16:       6561/4096          815.640 Pythagorean augmented fifth<br/> 17:    3011499/1835008       857.635<br/> 18:         27/16            905.865 Pythagorean major sixth<br/> 19:      12393/7168          947.860<br/> 20:         16/9             996.090 Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 21:         51/28           1038.085<br/> 22:        243/128          1109.775 Pythagorean major seventh<br/> 23:     111537/57344        1151.770<br/> 24:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>! xenogj24.scl<br/>!<br/>Neo-Gothic 3/17-flavor JI (keyboards 459:448 apart) 24<br/>!<br/> 459/448<br/> 2187/2048<br/> 1003833/917504<br/> 9/8<br/> 4131/3584<br/> 32/27<br/> 17/14<br/> 81/64<br/> 37179/28672<br/> 4/3<br/> 153/112<br/> 729/512<br/> 334611/229376<br/> 3/2<br/> 1377/896<br/> 6561/4096<br/> 3011499/1835008<br/> 27/16<br/> 12393/7168<br/> 16/9<br/> 51/28<br/> 243/128<br/> 111537/57344<br/> 2/1</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
