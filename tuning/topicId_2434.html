Since diamonds don&apos;t tesselate to fill ratio<br/>space, this use of the word seems quite incorrect.</p><p>Joe Monzo also included a quote from Brian McLaren, which as usual merits<br/>harsh criticism. The passage is guilty of wild exaggeration, facile<br/>reinterpretation of thousands of years of history, incorrect mathematical<br/>formulae (n^2-n-1 is only correct for n=5, 6, or 7), and worst of all, a<br/>very poor, mathematically abstract justification for Partch&apos;s procedure,<br/>which is about as far removed from Partch&apos;s philosophy as one could get, and<br/>lacks the slightest hint of a connection to the concept of Monophony.</p><p>I will not spend more time dissecting McLaren&apos;s piece, but I must say that<br/>in 10 years of studying tuning theory and 4 years on this list, I have never<br/>seen a higher garbage-to-insight ratio than in the  work of McLaren. Let him<br/>not take personal offense and may he rest assured that I hold him in the<br/>highest regard for his efforts in favor of microtonal music and his fine<br/>musical compositions.</p></div>
