Now according to Partch&apos;s or any other dualistic theory, the<br/>&gt; &quot;root&quot; of this chord is the note 1/1 which is the lowest common<br/>&gt;overtone (or its octave equivalents, 1/2 or 1/4 or 1/8) and<br/>&gt;corresponds, in this temperament, to the note A#.</p><p>Hi Paul...</p><p>Oh I see... so basically this is simply the high pitch &quot;guide tone&quot; for<br/>the utonal chords which we had been previously discussing, correct??</p><p>_________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
