We smugly<br/>overpopulate our little musical archipelago<br/>while entire continents lie uninhabited. The<br/>Columbuses and Magellans of those<br/>continents gather annually at Johnny<br/>Reinhard&apos;s American Festival of Microtonal<br/>Music. This year, perhaps competing with the<br/>Bang on a Can festival, his &quot;Microthon&quot;&#xFFFD; a<br/>term which ought to connote a teensy tiny<br/>marathon, but in this case meant a long<br/>stretch of microtonal music&#xFFFD; crammed<br/>souvenirs from a world of unknown musics into<br/>a single day.</p><p>Despite rampant underground interest on the<br/>Internet, microtonality remains for most people<br/>an enigma mired in obscure numerical<br/>theories. Microtonal composers could lose<br/>that enigmatic status overnight if they banded<br/>together and reached some unanimity on what<br/>kind of microtones to use. Thankfully, they<br/>never have. One wants perfect consonances;<br/>another extreme chromaticism; another exotic<br/>melodic nuances; another wants to hear beats<br/>between sliding tones; yet another thinks he&apos;ll<br/>stumble across the promised magical effects<br/>of the ancient &quot;harmony of the spheres.&quot;</p><p>Take Adam Silverman, whose beautifully<br/>restful Durham for strings was played<br/>energetically yet perfectly in tune by the Flux<br/>Quartet (Tom Chiu, first violinist). Silverman<br/>opted for harmonic variety with everything<br/>perfectly in tune, which required mercurially<br/>shifting intonations as the chords changed.<br/>Skip LaPlante, by contrast, went for maximum<br/>weirdness in a Theme and Variations in<br/>13-Tone Equal Temperament for his Music for<br/>Homemade Instruments Ensemble. On stove<br/>pans, plumbing pipes, and graded<br/>two-by-fours, the group plunked and then sang<br/>a tune in an ear-bending 13-step scale, with<br/>tones eerily closer together than we&apos;re used<br/>to. Despite its difficulty the feat was a pinnacle<br/>of laid-backness, the vocal section including<br/>lyrics such as &quot;blah blah blah blah.&quot;</p><p>Influenced by Indonesian gamelan, Patrick<br/>Grant aimed for melodic exoticism. His<br/>ensemble combined drums, gongs, and<br/>retuned electric pianos in Everything Distinct:<br/>Everything the Same: clearly a difficult work<br/>and a little too carefully played, but graced by<br/>melodies that drove home the 11th and 13th<br/>harmonics with ear-tickling regularity. Elodie<br/>Lauten in her XX took a more atmospheric<br/>approach. Her keyboard was tuned to a<br/>Pythagorean scale&#xFFFD; not much different from<br/>our usual piano tuning&#xFFFD; but each note<br/>brought forth a wavering cloud of sound, while<br/>she, singing, and Andrew Bolotowsky, on<br/>flute, intoned pitches a quarter-tone away from<br/>those emitted by the keyboard. Flamboyantly<br/>uninhibited Sasha Bogdanowitsch sang<br/>melodies with prerecorded overdubs of himself,<br/>capturing the rich vocal resonances of<br/>barbershop quartet (America&apos;s last bastion of<br/>vernacular pure tuning) in an equally mystical<br/>idiom.</p><p>The guiding spirit behind such microtonal<br/>events is always, and may always be, Harry<br/>Partch. These days every performance of his<br/>music becomes a political statement, for there<br/>is a war on between the Partch purists who<br/>feel only the instruments he invented should<br/>be used and those who will make<br/>arrangements for any adaptable substitutes. I<br/>distrust purism in all forms, yet even my<br/>standards of Partch performance were<br/>stretched by Reinhard&apos;s extremely loose<br/>rendition of Barstow, a classic bit of<br/>Americana based on hitchhiker inscriptions.<br/>Garnet Willis played a makeshift<br/>Chromelodeon (Partch&apos;s 43-tone harmonium)<br/>jerry-rigged from two accordions, and I<br/>anticipate heated arguments pro and con<br/>among Internet tuning circles in coming<br/>weeks.</p><p>For some reason&#xFFFD; probably because the<br/>guitar is the most frustratingly difficult<br/>instrument to tune well&#xFFFD; the microtonal world<br/>is inundated with guitarists. Here we heard<br/>John Growski with his 19-tone guitar, Paul<br/>Erlich with his 22-tone guitar, and Wim<br/>Hoogewerf with a 24-tone instrument. And it<br/>was a coup on Reinhard&apos;s part to end with an<br/>electronic work by Joe Monzo, who is more<br/>theorist than composer, but who has been<br/>doing some of the most important theoretical<br/>work in tuning. For example, he&apos;s developing<br/>software that will allow live microtonal<br/>computer performance based on movement<br/>through multidimensional pitch lattices. Based<br/>on the Whitman poem, his piece A Noiseless<br/>Patient Spider wasn&apos;t ambitious, but it did<br/>capture with startling clarity the feel of a spider<br/>moving through a geometric web of pitches.</p><p>Not all the music was so whacked out. Erlich,<br/>on guitar and synth both tuned to 22 tones,<br/>played a waltz, a rock solo, a modal improv,<br/>that sounded almost normal. With only a<br/>melodic nuance sounding odd here and there,<br/>it was marginally pop, harmonically<br/>conventional, even naive. And yet, what better<br/>music for demonstrating that we don&apos;t need to<br/>abandon the harmonies we&apos;re used to when we<br/>redivide the octave? Erlich wrung feelings we&apos;re<br/>used to from a scale we&apos;ve hardly explored,<br/>and provided a reminder that musical<br/>revolutions always come from below: not from<br/>the experts who invariably have a status quo<br/>to defend, but from the amateurs who hear all<br/>the beautiful details the experts miss. With<br/>music like his, Grant&apos;s, Silverman&apos;s, and<br/>Monzo&apos;s etching new pitches in our memory,<br/>the 21st can hardly become just another<br/>12-pitch century.</p><p>[photo of composer here]<br/>Joe Monzo&apos;s a noiseless<br/>patient spider captured with<br/>startling clarity the feel of a<br/>spider moving through a<br/>geometric web of pitches.<br/>(photo: Michael Schmelling)</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
