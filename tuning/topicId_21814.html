This isn&apos;t really directed at you in particular, but<br/>at EVERYONE, but I&apos;m just writing you because I am truly<br/>fascinated by this attitude.

I am writing in the hopes that you<br/>and others who agree with you can share with me details of<br/>your beliefs because I truly find myself confounded by<br/>them.</p><p>Do you get paid for your job?

And I apologize for<br/>the fact that I am doing this. But somebody has to say<br/>something becasue your views are far from unique. They are<br/>becoming the new paradigm of the selfish and destructive<br/>baby boomer generation: Gimmee gimmee gimmeee! Me me me!!<br/>All for me!! All for me!!</p><p>Although I myself write music software and design music<br/>hardware, if anyone asks me about writing software or<br/>doing engineering in general, I tell them it&apos;s not a good<br/>career choice, and it is particularly not a good choice to<br/>work in the music industry, and it is definitely not worth<br/>their time working on adding tuning features to<br/>synthesizers. There&apos;s 450 people on this list and a number<br/>of them work in acoustic instruments. Of those who do use<br/>computers artistically, there are several platforms<br/>represented. And of that incredibly small customer base to<br/>begin with, although most of them appear to have computers<br/>that are at least capable of internet access, few believe<br/>that they should have to support the development of<br/>anything by doing say, paying for the software that is<br/>helping them achieve their artistic goals.</p><p>Music software and hardware development is kind of a<br/>stupid thing to waste one&apos;s time on if you need to choose<br/>something to make a living on. As long as this continues<br/>to be true, development on new tools and the promotion of<br/>new musics will be much slower than it should be. There is<br/>actually a reason why so many of the audio software houses<br/>have to put dongles and copy protection schemes on their<br/>software. They would go out of business otherwise since it<br/>is a very small market.</p><p>You say that you yourself are familiar with software<br/>development. Is there anything stopping you from writing<br/>all this great software you want for free yourself?<br/>Perhaps after you get it working you can come to my house<br/>and set it up for me so that I can have it too. Am I<br/>missing something in interpreting this as the economic<br/>model you appear to embrace and expect?</p><p>Back in the old days they had people who were slaves. They<br/>still have these people in many parts of the world,<br/>including the US and its territories.</p><p>The master owned the slave and didn&apos;t pay him money for<br/>his work. But the slave did recieve room and board --<br/>food, since the master had an investment in the slaves.<br/>They were valuable to him! They provided him with help<br/>that made him financially successful and he appreciated<br/>that!</p><p>Ah for the life of a slave!</p><p>Or a barn animal. They have it good. My goats give<br/>me milk. In return I attend to their needs and give<br/>them sweet feed. I don&apos;t just go out there and take from<br/>them without giving something in return.</p><p>My soil gives my plants in the garden which I pick and<br/>eat. In the past, foolish farmers did this without<br/>repaying the soil. The result -- sterility, dead soil,<br/>poor crops, blight and pestilence.</p><p>The chickens like living here. They run up to me<br/>and follow me around. Yes, I steal and eat their<br/>egg children, but I give them chicken food and<br/>clean out their coop and chase away dogs. They<br/>think it&apos;s a fair trade.</p><p>It does not take a rocket scientist to figure these things<br/>out. This is common sense knowledge that is available to<br/>any poor dumb peasant. But in our modern society we have<br/>an overwhelming vast majority of people running around<br/>claiming that raping and pillaging is the best model for<br/>sustainable growth!</p><p>Nowadays we can not find such a life of luxury as a slave<br/>or livestock. Everyone feels they have a moral right to<br/>steal the labor of others without any compensation, or<br/>complain loudly that they are not given things for free.<br/>How selfish and unrealistic everyone has become. People<br/>trade in stocks like chickens with their heads cut off and<br/>yet they have absolutely no clue whatsoever about basic<br/>economics. Such as that companies must produce some sort<br/>of revenue generating product to stay in business.</p><p>&quot;Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and<br/>his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor&apos;s service<br/>without wages, and gives him not for his work.&quot; - Jeremiah<br/>22:13</p><p>&quot;The laborer is worthy of his hire.&quot; - Luke 10:7</p><p>&quot;Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who<br/>plants a vineyard, and eats not the fruit thereof? or who<br/>feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?&quot; - 1<br/>Corinthians 9:7</p><p>&quot;For the scripture says, you shall not muzzle the ox that<br/>treads out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his<br/>reward.&quot; - 1 Timothy 5:18</p><p>&quot;The husbandman that labors must be first partaker of the<br/>fruits.&quot; - 2 Timothy 2:6</p><p>Any one agree with me or am I the only one that sees it<br/>this way?</p><p>Let me be clear here: Taking without giving does not lead<br/>to growth and better things, it leads to sterility and<br/>death.</p><p>I can not begin to express the heartwrenching<br/>disappointment I feel when I realize that so many<br/>supposedly educated people who have so much potential and<br/>so much to offer have bought into the bizarre and<br/>destructive culture of materialism that teaches that<br/>people should take what they want and look out for number<br/>one and have no concern whatsoever for the people they are<br/>stealing from.</p><p>&quot;Wanting to be wise, they became as fools.&quot;</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>PS - I want to commend three people that I know of who are<br/>doing a wonderful job of assisting and developing the<br/>cause of microtonality rather than expecting to be given<br/>free stuff:</p><p>Jonathan and Elizabeth Glasier</p><p>  for their financial and emotional<br/>  patronage of Ivor Darreg and others.<br/>  They are not rich but they believe<br/>  in using what they have to support<br/>  work they believe in.</p><p>Gary Morrison</p><p>  for his tremendous financial and time<br/>  investment in the Xenharmonic Alliance.</p><p>Brian McLaren</p><p>  for not backing down from the truth<br/>  and for putting his time, finances,<br/>  intellectual and emotional energy<br/>  full force into what he believes in.</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>4/29/2001 1:24:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff Scott wrote:</p><p>&gt; Someone wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve come *very close* to buying a G4 a number of times because<br/>&gt; &gt; of the wealth of great music software that only runs on the Mac.<br/>&gt; &gt; But each time I consider it, I look at the *price tags* on all<br/>&gt; &gt; that great software, shake my head, remember my great<br/>&gt; &gt; programming skill and the wealth of *free open-source* music and<br/>&gt; &gt; system software out there, such as CSound, sfront, and Linux,<br/>&gt; &gt; and the fact that my other hobby, computational finance,<br/>&gt; &gt; essentially is constrained to Windows because my data service<br/>&gt; &gt; runs there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi.

This isn&apos;t really directed at you in particular, but<br/>&gt; at EVERYONE, but I&apos;m just writing you because I am truly<br/>&gt; fascinated by this attitude.<br/>What attitude is that? The *fact* that my budget, like everyone<br/>else&apos;s, is *finite*?</p><p>&gt; It keeps coming up in the<br/>&gt; news and on thisn list. I am writing in the hopes that you<br/>&gt; and others who agree with you can share with me details of<br/>&gt; your beliefs because I truly find myself confounded by<br/>&gt; them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you get paid for your job?<br/>Yes. And my job does not involve either of my principal hobbies,<br/>computational finance or computer music. It does have a number of<br/>things in common with them, most notably extensive use of numerical<br/>calculations. There are other things I can and have done with this<br/>particular skill in the past, some for free and some for money.</p><p>&gt; Do you expect to be paid?<br/>Yes, but that is simply a result of the fact that what I do provides<br/>value to my employer. If he could find someone who does what I do for<br/>less money, I fully recognize that I am likely to be cut loose with<br/>little warning. It is part of my job to continue to grow technically<br/>and personally so that I am worth what they pay me.</p><p>&gt; Will you come over to my house and paint my barn for free?<br/>I&apos;m not a painter. I wouldn&apos;t even pretend to charge money for<br/>painting a barn, nor would I do a particularly good job of it. I&apos;m a<br/>mathematician, and there are quite a few circumstances under which I<br/>would do math for free.</p><p>&gt; Do you honestly believe that it does not take significant<br/>&gt; amounts of time and money to develop software?<br/>Hell, no! I do this for a living, remember. That&apos;s *exactly* been my<br/>point to the people who&apos;ve been complaining about CSound ... that it<br/>costs money to do that.</p><p>&gt; If those<br/>&gt; who find the software useful and valuable are not willing<br/>&gt; to pay for it, how will it be developed? The open source<br/>&gt; movement is fine for people who have stipends, are on<br/>&gt; welfare, have university jobs, or have been left money by<br/>&gt; their parents, and I applaud any of them who want to spend<br/>&gt; their life making things and giving them away for free.<br/>Why do you suppose all these people do this? Could it possibly be<br/>because they love it, and that is more important than money? Could it<br/>be because they hate Microsoft? :-) I can&apos;t speak for all of them,<br/>but those that I have met on mailing lists do this because they love<br/>it, and because they are using the tools they make and are willing to<br/>share them with others. All they ask in return is a willingness to<br/>contribute whatever one can.</p><p>Something is worth *exactly* what a customer is willing to pay for<br/>it -- no more, no less. I just bought Red Hat Linux 7.1 Deluxe<br/>Workstation Edition for $80US. Much of the software on the seven CDs<br/>is free software I could have downloaded off the Internet. But I paid<br/>for the convenience of not having to download 4.5 gigabytes at 21.6<br/>Kbits per second, and for 60 days of support.</p><p>What is on those seven CDs is a modern operating system with *two*<br/>GUIs, an &quot;office&quot; package similar in functionality to Microsoft<br/>Office, *two* scientific application packages comparable in<br/>functionality to MatLab, a world-class statistical package called R<br/>and some music and sound software I haven&apos;t had time to explore as<br/>yet.</p><p>I also own Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional ($300US), Microsoft<br/>Office 2000 ($250), Adobe Acrobat ($250), a stock and commodity<br/>database and a few other smaller packages, mostly music related.</p><p>&gt; But for the rest of us, how will we eat if no one is<br/>&gt; willing to pay for the work we do for them?<br/>You need to understand that you will not always be paid what *you*<br/>think you are worth, but what your *employer* or *customer* thinks<br/>you are worth. Given that fact, how you will eat is strictly up to<br/>you.</p><p>&gt; OK, I am not one to flame but this really rankled me and<br/>&gt; I believe a flame is necessary here because of the rank<br/>&gt; audacity of the ideas being put forth. And I apologize for<br/>&gt; the fact that I am doing this. But somebody has to say<br/>&gt; something becasue your views are far from unique. They are<br/>&gt; becoming the new paradigm of the selfish and destructive<br/>&gt; baby boomer generation: Gimmee gimmee gimmeee! Me me me!!<br/>&gt; All for me!! All for me!!<br/>I am actually not officially a baby boomer ... I was born *during*<br/>WWII, not after it. I do not *expect* free software, but I *use* it,<br/>and I *contribute* to its development within the limits of available<br/>time. Read the GNU Public License sometime.</p><p>&gt; Although I myself write music software and design music<br/>&gt; hardware, if anyone asks me about writing software or<br/>&gt; doing engineering in general, I tell them it&apos;s not a good<br/>&gt; career choice, and it is particularly not a good choice to<br/>&gt; work in the music industry, and it is definitely not worth<br/>&gt; their time working on adding tuning features to<br/>&gt; synthesizers.<br/>You&apos;ve just made a marketing decision for yourself ... I applaud that<br/>fact, but you don&apos;t speak for everyone. I think that&apos;s bad advice<br/>you&apos;re giving people for a variety of reasons.</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s 450 people on this list and a number<br/>&gt; of them work in acoustic instruments. Of those who do use<br/>&gt; computers artistically, there are several platforms<br/>&gt; represented. And of that incredibly small customer base to<br/>&gt; begin with, although most of them appear to have computers<br/>&gt; that are at least capable of internet access, few believe<br/>&gt; that they should have to support the development of<br/>&gt; anything by doing say, paying for the software that is<br/>&gt; helping them achieve their artistic goals.<br/>Well, I paid for CDP ... I think it&apos;s well worth what I paid for it,<br/>too. I paid for CoolEdit 2000 -- same thing. jSYN -- ditto. Those are<br/>three wheels I don&apos;t have any interest in re-inventing. And how can<br/>you know what &quot;few&quot; or &quot;many&quot; believe? I can only tell you what *I*<br/>believe, as I am doing.</p><p>&gt; Music software and hardware development is kind of a<br/>&gt; stupid thing to waste one&apos;s time on if you need to choose<br/>&gt; something to make a living on.<br/>If you truly love it and are truly good at it, it is not a waste of<br/>time. Can I compete with Yamaha or Roland? Of course not! This is a<br/>hobby for me. I do love it and I am good at it and I don&apos;t consider<br/>it a waste of time. If tomorrow my employer decided he didn&apos;t need me<br/>any more, I would certainly consider turning it from a hobby to a job<br/>or a business. But I don&apos;t expect to get paid if I don&apos;t produce<br/>something of value.</p><p>&gt; As long as this continues<br/>&gt; to be true, development on new tools and the promotion of<br/>&gt; new musics will be much slower than it should be.<br/>I contend just the opposite: it is free software and open source that<br/>makes new musics possible! It is the Internet that is responsible for<br/>bringing microtonalists all over the world together in this group.<br/>Yahoo lets us talk to each other absolutely free in exchange for<br/>subjecting us to advertising that we are free to ignore. It&apos;s the<br/>same deal as network TV -- I get to see &quot;Law and Order&quot; and I don&apos;t<br/>have to buy a blooming thing, nor do I have to feel guilty if I don&apos;t<br/>happen to need what they&apos;re selling.</p><p>&gt; There is<br/>&gt; actually a reason why so many of the audio software houses<br/>&gt; have to put dongles and copy protection schemes on their<br/>&gt; software. They would go out of business otherwise since it<br/>&gt; is a very small market.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You say that you yourself are familiar with software<br/>&gt; development. Is there anything stopping you from writing<br/>&gt; all this great software you want for free yourself?<br/>I write what I need to write, buy what I need to buy and use what I<br/>can use that is free.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps after you get it working you can come to my house<br/>&gt; and set it up for me so that I can have it too.<br/>A few posts back, I mentioned that I am going to integrate a Linux<br/>system for sound and that I *might* post some of my code on my web<br/>site. I&apos;ll even post instructions for how to install it, and help you<br/>out with it if it gives you any grief. That assumes that it is<br/>something that would be of use to you, though. If I came up with<br/>something that enough people thought was worth paying for, I might<br/>actually sell it, but that&apos;s unlikely given the nature of what I&apos;m<br/>doing.</p><p>My music combines several ideas: algorithmic composition,<br/>microtonality, musique concrete and found music. It&apos;s my unique<br/>thing, and the software I write is mostly &quot;glue logic&quot; making these<br/>things happen. Unless you happen to be doing exactly the same things<br/>as I&apos;m doing, it might be more trouble to get it running than it<br/>would be worth.</p><p>For example, one of the projects I&apos;m working on is turning stock<br/>market price and volume series into music. It&apos;s similar in principle<br/>to Charles Dodge&apos;s &quot;Earth&apos;s Magnetic Field&quot;, although I&apos;m not using<br/>the obvious translation of stock price to pitch, but instead<br/>computing the parameters of the stochastic process that generates the<br/>prices and generating musical materials from an emulation of that<br/>process.</p><p>The code that computes the parameters uses the above-mentioned<br/>statistical package R. I have that part running already; it took<br/>about four hours to piece it together, which is a testimony to how<br/>easy R is to work with. The code that generates the actual music is<br/>going to look a lot like Xenakis&apos; &quot;gendy&quot; from &quot;Formalized Music&quot;,<br/>once I figure out what he&apos;s doing. But it will be implemented in the<br/>GPL &quot;sfront&quot; package, with a fair amount of Perl &quot;glue logic&quot; simply<br/>because I can program faster in Perl than other languages. I&apos;m using<br/>three GPL tools: R, sfront and Perl. All three will run on either<br/>Windows or Linux (and probably Macintosh as well, though I don&apos;t own<br/>one so I have no idea :-).</p><p>&gt; Am I<br/>&gt; missing something in interpreting this as the economic<br/>&gt; model you appear to embrace and expect?<br/>Well, you&apos;re making a lot of assumptions about the way I and others<br/>think and feel. I believe in free software and open source in the<br/>sense of the GNU Public License. I have a full-time job, and though<br/>my employer is perfectly willing to spend thousands of dollars buying<br/>me a statistical package, I am phasing over to the free GPL package<br/>R, which is as good as, and in some cases better than, the commercial<br/>ones. My economic model is that the *customer* determines the worth<br/>of my creations.</p><p>&gt; Back in the old days they had people who were slaves. They<br/>&gt; still have these people in many parts of the world,<br/>&gt; including the US and its territories.</p><p>OK ... drop the political propaganda!

This isn&apos;t really directed at you in particular, but<br/>&gt; at EVERYONE,</p><p>Hi, I&apos;m one of the &quot;someones&quot;. As a full time musician, composer, performer,<br/>private music teacher (and part time website designer and Mac<br/>troubleshooting to make ends meet), I would agree with you that our<br/>livelyhoods as artists and musicians are just as jeopardized by the current<br/>state of affairs (Napster, etc) that software designers such as yourself<br/>face today in the &quot;new economy&quot; that our politicians love to expound upon.<br/>We certainly live in a culture of many wanting or expecting something for<br/>nothing, and thus it is often a hard road for creative people in any field.</p><p>As an example, lots of people are quite willing to download free mp3s or<br/>sound samples from my and other musicians&apos; websites, and only a small<br/>percentage of those visitors buy CDs. Similarly, lots of software is<br/>available as a &quot;light&quot; version for free download, and only a small<br/>percentage of customers will buy the full version. This is a cost of doing<br/>business, that can be considered advertising.</p><p>&gt; Do you honestly believe that it does not take significant<br/>&gt; amounts of time and money to develop software? If those<br/>&gt; who find the software useful and valuable are not willing<br/>&gt; to pay for it, how will it be developed? The open source<br/>&gt; movement is fine for people who have stipends, are on<br/>&gt; welfare, have university jobs, or have been left money by<br/>&gt; their parents, and I applaud any of them who want to spend<br/>&gt; their life making things and giving them away for free.<br/>&gt; But for the rest of us, how will we eat if no one is<br/>&gt; willing to pay for the work we do for them?</p><p>I greatly appreciate the existence of people (many with full time jobs and<br/>families) who freely give their knowledge as open source programmers, or for<br/>that matter, the people here on the tuning list who offer help to newbies.<br/>I, for one, have been a grateful recipient of their high level of<br/>scholarship. I am happy to buy and pay for all software and upgrades of<br/>software that I use (and I use a lot), and am also quite happy to find the<br/>occasional freeware online that does a needed job as well. In the same way,<br/>I spend an inordinate percentage of my musical income buying books, CDs and<br/>other learning tools (many independently produced) that will help in my<br/>greater understanding of JI and many other tools available to me as a<br/>composer. Now and then, I download freeware that would help in this effort<br/>as well. I am also very grateful to those who post on this list freely, as<br/>there are many things that have I have read in said purchased books (Partch,<br/>for one) that become much more clear to me from people posting their ideas<br/>without charge. Perhaps I will be able to offer something back to someone<br/>else in the same spirit of giving in the future.</p><p>&gt; Back in the old days they had people who were slaves. They<br/>&gt; still have these people in many parts of the world,<br/>&gt; including the US and its territories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The master owned the slave and didn&apos;t pay him money for<br/>&gt; his work. But the slave did recieve room and board --<br/>&gt; food, since the master had an investment in the slaves.<br/>&gt; They were valuable to him! They provided him with help<br/>&gt; that made him financially successful and he appreciated<br/>&gt; that!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah for the life of a slave!</p><p>Here is where I have to disagree! Slaveowners, as is evident by their<br/>inhumane behavior, did not exhibit appreciation as would befit someone who<br/>made them successful. They rewarded their slaves with substandard living<br/>conditions, separation of families, rape, torture and death once a slave<br/>ceased to &quot;produce&quot; enough to be of &quot;value&quot;. The corporate conglomerate we<br/>live within often tends to behave in much the same way towards members of<br/>the poor and working classes, particularly in third world countries, but<br/>also in the USA, when they think no one is watching. They reward workers<br/>with layoffs, poverty wages, cutting back of benefits, etc. The analogy of<br/>slavery compared to freeware downloads doesn&apos;t really make it for me, I<br/>actually find it highly offensive.</p><p>Anyway, enough of this OT reply from me, I wish to get back to music and<br/>tuning...</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p><p>&quot;I believe in Spinoza&apos;s God, who revealed himself in the harmony of all<br/>being, not in the God who concerns himself with the fate and actions of<br/>men.&quot; --Albert Einstein when asked by a New York rabbi, &quot;Do you believe in<br/>God?&quot;</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MR88CET@TEXAS.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2001 4:36:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>J Scott wrote:</p><p>&gt; PS - I want to commend three people that I know of who are<br/>&gt; doing a wonderful job of assisting and developing the<br/>&gt; cause of microtonality rather than expecting to be given<br/>&gt; free stuff:   ...<br/>&gt; Gary Morrison<br/>&gt;   for his tremendous financial and time<br/>&gt;   investment in the Xenharmonic Alliance.   ...</p><p>Thanks Mr. Scott!
