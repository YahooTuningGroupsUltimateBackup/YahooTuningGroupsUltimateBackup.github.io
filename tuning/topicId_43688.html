Carlos did a good job of - probably - using studio efx, filtering and<br/>DSP thus making it is very difficult to determine for sure with any accuracy<br/>or certitude.</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, the &quot;Yves Klein Bleu Aardvark&quot;</p><p>&quot;The wonderousness of the human mind is too great to be transferred into<br/>music only by 7 or 12<br/>elements of tone steps in one octave.&quot; - shakuhachi master Masayuki Koga</p><p>    &quot;In the beginning was noise - raw sound, the seed sound, the One, _Nada<br/>Brahma_, the Big Bang. And noise begat rhythm. And rhythm begat everything<br/>else. And thus the Dance began. Rhythm and noise. There is terror in noise,<br/>and in that terror there is also power.&quot; - adapted from writings by Mickey<br/>Hart</p><p>&quot;I have the feeling that the English word &apos;noise&apos; has more negative<br/>connotations than our German word &apos;Gerausch&apos;.  We would describe the sound of<br/>wind blowing as Gerausch, to imply that it&apos;s a beautiful and natural sound.<br/>...I make noise...I like these sounds and this has nothing to do with<br/>&apos;anti-beauty&apos;&quot; - Helmut Lachenmann</p><p>&quot;We cannot doubt that animals both love and practice music. That is evident.<br/>But it seems their musical system differs from ours. It is another<br/>school...We are not familiar with their didactic works. Perhaps they don&apos;t<br/>have any.&quot;  - Erik Satie</p><p>&quot;Among the artistic hierarchy, the birds are probably the greatest musicians<br/>to inhabit our planet.&quot; - Olivier Messiaen</p><p>NADA BRAHMA - Sanskrit, &quot;sound [is the] Godhead&quot;<br/>LILA - Sanskrit, &quot;divine play/sport/whimsy&quot; - &quot;the universe is what happens<br/>when God wants to play&quot; - &quot;joyous exercise of spontaneity involved in the art<br/>of creation&quot;</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang</p><p>...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than stasis. ... you have<br/>to be aware of the fact that improvisation is about a constant change. -<br/>Steve Beresford</p><p>    Mankind&apos;s first musical performance couldn&apos;t have been anything other<br/>than a free improvisation. - Derek Bailey</p><p>    What strange risk of hearing can bring sound to music - a hearing whose<br/>obligation awakens a sensibility so new that it is forever a unique,<br/>new-born, anti-death surprise, created now and now and now. .. a hearing<br/>whose moment in time is always daybreak.  - Lucia Dlugoszewski</p></div>
