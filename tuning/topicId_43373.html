The difference is the following :<br/>&gt; While 7 consecutive terms (orders 1  2  3  4  5  6  7) of a neutral<br/>thirds chain generate a 7-tones<br/>&gt; Mohajira,<br/>&gt; The Rast structure is only a defective scale of the same series,<br/>which would be 1 (...) 3  4  5  6<br/>&gt; 7 (...) 9,<br/>&gt; such as (octave-reduced, with tonic in 3) : 1-(39)-3-59-9-11-27-<br/>(33)-81  etc., which would be to my<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; point of view a good basic model for one of the two types of Rast<br/>usually developped in the Maqam<br/>&gt; context.<br/>&gt; Bayati would be another mode of the same, with tonic one tone<br/>higher, except that Bayati<br/>&gt; is more identified (by the master of qanun Julien Jalaladdin Weiss<br/>and others) as a 13-limit scale,<br/>&gt; such as<br/>&gt; the typical 1/1  13/12  32/27  4/3  3/2  13/8  16/9 or another one<br/>of my differential-coherent<br/>&gt; models<br/>&gt; which is, in its basic form, 3  13  57  1  9  39  85.<br/>&gt;
