The feeling of a note in<br/>&gt; &gt; different octaves is far from something to disregard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely. The sense in which the word &quot;equivalence&quot; makes<br/>sense has<br/>&gt; to do with a putative &quot;chroma&quot; concept -- or not. See the<br/>SpecMus<br/>&gt; archives for more on this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I know Helmholtz is old but for purely harmonic timbres what<br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; said is far from blatantly wrong.  Your statement is just so<br/>&gt; &gt; extremely dismissive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t think so -- I mentioned the historical importance, which<br/>is<br/>&gt; extremely relevant for the kinds of conversations we have on<br/>this<br/>&gt; list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If the modern theory is so clear<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s not what I said at all!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; then why<br/>&gt; &gt; isn&apos;t there some modern book that just difinitively replaces<br/>&gt; &gt; Helmholtz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because such a book would be way too large. Helmholtz&apos;s<br/>book is not<br/>&gt; used in modern classes on acoustics or psychoacoustics. I<br/>would<br/>&gt; recommend beginning with Juan Roederer&apos;s _Introduction to<br/>the Physics<br/>&gt; and Psychophysics of Music_ and following the references<br/>from there<br/>&gt; as they lead you into areas that interest you more.<br/>Nevertheless,<br/>&gt; Helmholtz was one of the giants of the field and I meant in no<br/>way to<br/>&gt; disparage his achievement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t mean to imply that there aren&apos;t complicated<br/>&gt; &gt; exceptions and timbre issues that Helmholtz didn&apos;t consider,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; what grounds to you have to dismiss any of his claims on<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; issue?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, he points out some properties which are *suggestive*,<br/>but that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t amount to an *explanation* in my book. Helmholtz was<br/>&gt; completely unaware of many aspects of hearing, for example<br/>the<br/>&gt; virtual pitch phenomenon, and was mistaken in many areas,<br/>for example<br/>&gt; the location of the production of combinational tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, I think harmonically that twelfths and octaves<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; VERY similar in harmonic timbres.  I think the biggest reason<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; hear them differently is because we already have a<br/>developed<br/>&gt; &gt; melodic sense that identifies octave-equivalent scale<br/>degrees<br/>&gt; &gt; and it is hard to separate that (meaning our melodic<br/>MEMORY)<br/>&gt; &gt; from the harmonic feeling of the two tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may be right and I won&apos;t close my mind on this issue. I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know of any culture which names its pitches in a repeating<br/>scale of<br/>&gt; twelfths or stretched twelfths or shrunk twelfths, and the music<br/>I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard that uses such scales fails to engender a new kind of<br/>chroma<br/>&gt; that wraps at the twelfth in my ear. But it may yet happen . . .</p><p>Thanks for the book recommendation.  As I will certainly read<br/>some newer book on acoustics, it is nice to have a<br/>recommendation as to where to start.  Everyone seems to<br/>mention the Benade book, but it is not exactly *new* and I&apos;ve<br/>heard some criticism.  I trust you in your recommendation.<br/>There&apos;s a scathing review at <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> though of the<br/>Roederer that made me wary.  Also the Benade has a medium<br/>review from 2000 containing the claim:<br/>&quot;there is no really top notch acoustics book with modern<br/>research available at this time.&quot;<br/>Do you agree with that?  It seems there&apos;s nothing quite right out<br/>there, just a lot of stuff with mixed good and bad info and<br/>historical interest...</p><p>In relation to that, I&apos;m nearly finished with On The Sensation and<br/>I&apos;m wishing there was some kind of at least list if not explanation<br/>that said generally what is still accepted and what to disregard<br/>from Helmholtz/Ellis.  Is there?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2004 7:46:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s a scathing review at <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> though of the<br/>&gt; Roederer that made me wary.</p><p>Who wrote the review and what did they say?</p><p>&gt; Also the Benade has a medium<br/>&gt; review from 2000 containing the claim:<br/>&gt; &quot;there is no really top notch acoustics book with modern<br/>&gt; research available at this time.&quot;<br/>&gt; Do you agree with that?</p><p>Probably, though I&apos;ve been out of the libraries for years now.</p><p>&gt; It seems there&apos;s nothing quite right out<br/>&gt; there, just a lot of stuff with mixed good and bad info and<br/>&gt; historical interest...</p><p>Maybe you&apos;ll be the one to write that book.
