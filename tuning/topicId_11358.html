I could explain what is the problem, especially with<br/>cheaper guitars, and what can one do to fix it, but this is not the<br/>right place. In my experience, guitars with a well adjusted nut,<br/>bridge, and neck curvature do not need any bent frets -- well, I suggest<br/>using a two-layer string for G rather than a plain-line type.</p><p>- George Kahrimanis   <a href="mailto:anakreon@hol.gr">anakreon@hol.gr</a></p></div>
