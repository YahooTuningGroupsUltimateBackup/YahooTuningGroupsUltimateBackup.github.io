This is sort of the<br/>musical version of R. Buckminster Fuller&apos;s concept<br/>of the &quot;closest packing of spheres&quot;.</p><p>   This past summer I finally realized how to create<br/>diagrams of these &quot;nested&quot; asymmetrical 12EDO<br/>subscales (specifically the 20 blues pentachords),<br/>and I&apos;ll create a folder and post these to the list&apos;s<br/>files archive as soon as possible.</p><p>Bill Flavell</p></div>
