But the QWERTY-MIDI<br/>recorder does work in this version:  I used it back in<br/>May to assist in the composition of my AFMM Microthon<br/>piece _A Noiseless Patient Spider_.  I&apos;d be happy<br/>to let you be a sort of &apos;beta-tester&apos; if you&apos;d like<br/>to try it.  Email me privately.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

It fits nicely onto all the letter<br/>and number keys, including those for the usual punctuation<br/>marks, and I use the | \ key for 2/1, making 44 notes in all.</p><p>JustMusic will also allow the user to map pitches to 10<br/>of the &apos;function keys&apos; at the top of the keyboard, as<br/>well as the ~ &grave;, _ -, and + = keys, giving a total of 57<br/>available QWERTY keys.  Of course, these can be *any*<br/>57 pitches, including &apos;octave&apos; doublings of others already<br/>mapped.</p><p>With JustMusic, it&apos;s very easy to create a 1-pitch-per-key<br/>mapping as follows: open a Lattice file, then open the<br/>Keyboard window, and in key-edit mode, simply type a<br/>QWERTY key to open the key-editor window, then click the<br/>mouse on the desired lattice-point in the Lattice window<br/>to map that ratio onto the QWERTY key.</p><p>The only drawback to using the QWERTY keyboard is that it<br/>is strictly monophonic, i.e., it can only play one QWERTY<br/>key at a time.  This is really not a problem if your<br/>intended use is to record one track of a MIDI sequence,<br/>but it is a serious limitation for real-time use.  That&apos;s<br/>why Ken Fasano gave JustMusic the ability to map entire<br/>chords and melodies to single QWERTY keys, but it&apos;s still<br/>not the same as *real* real-time polyphony.  Does anyone<br/>know how to get around this and make QWERTY polyphonic?</p><p>I had also intended, awhile back, to mention my software<br/>in regard to Jon Szanto&apos;s question about &apos;instruments&apos;<br/>which make the theory plainly visible.  When JustMusic<br/>is ready for release, I intend for it to encompass all<br/>of my theoretical and notational ideas in a very obivous<br/>way.</p><p>(Don&apos;t get angry, Jon, but Ken and I also intend to include<br/>virtual Partch instruments...<br/>yikes! here comes another brick!...)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
