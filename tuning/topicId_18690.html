Okay, I can buy 32:[2]7 as<br/>&lt;&gt;an out-of-tune 6:5.<br/>&lt;<br/>&lt;But you&apos;ve skipped over 13:11, which is closer. So perhaps things start<br/>&lt;getting a bit fuzzy around 11?</p><p>That&apos;s reasonable. But after sleeping over it, I find myself a bit uncomfortable<br/>with hearing 32:27 as an out of tune 6:5. The differences in the listening tests<br/>for the various minor thirds were really quite vivid</p><p>And you&apos;re also right. Characterizing 32:21 as a small minor sixth was<br/>misleading. I should have characterized it simply as 32:21.</p><p>In any case, the limit model based on instrumental spectra suggests 16 to 24 as<br/>the range where &quot;fuzziness&quot; enters. Perhaps instead of your &quot;fuzziness&quot; or my<br/>&quot;out-of-tuneness&quot; we could start talking about interval classes.</p><p>It&apos;s nice that both of these models start to parallel critical band width in<br/>that they reach a plateau where the width gets no narrower.</p><p>&lt;<br/>&lt;I think they do, in some listeners and in some registers. Witness Dan<br/>&lt;Stearns&apos; opinion that 11:9 is more concordant than 9:7 or 11:8. And &lt;harmonic<br/>entropy, my little model of &quot;fuzziness&quot;, seems to predict this &lt;quite clearly.</p><p>I have no doubt that one can create musical contexts where the denominator rule<br/>is overridden (that&apos;s in my original post), especially when the denominators are<br/>so close. Conditioning is a strong form of contextualization.  But repeated<br/>tests comparing randoming selected dyads from neighboring denominator classes<br/>have really convinced me that 9:7 will have more sensory consonance than 11:8,<br/>which is, in turn, more consonant than 11:9, provided the intervals are voiced<br/>sufficiently high up (i.e. above the harmonic series scaffolding).</p><p>As I wrote in the initial posting, accepting this outcome required a heavy<br/>revision of my investment in factoring.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

In a high register, the central pitch<br/>processor has less uncertainty, and the harmonic entropy model predicts, as<br/>you say, that 9:7 is more concordant than 11:8 which is a bit more<br/>concordant than 11:9 -- and this agrees with my perceptions too. But in a<br/>lower register, a greater uncertainty is in effect, and Dan Stearns&apos; and my<br/>perceptions, as well as the harmonic entropy model, predict that 11:9 is the<br/>most concordant of these three intervals. Care to comment?</p><p>&gt;As I wrote in the initial posting, accepting this outcome required a heavy<br/>&gt;revision of my investment in factoring.</p><p>Well, let me breathe a great big sigh of relief for that! I&apos;m glad we can<br/>agree on that.</p></div>
