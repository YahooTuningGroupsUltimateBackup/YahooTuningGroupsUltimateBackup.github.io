I left out a note, the 12th note of my NPJ scale should be 15/8. Twice you have have said you would check the number of symmetries that occur with my scale. Hopefully this will be third time lucky. You&apos;ve often mentioned a scale that would turn the masses onto microtonality, I think this could be it. Let me know what you think of it.<br/>John.</p></div><h3><a id=90689 href="#90689">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2010 6:23:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John&gt;&quot;Twice you have have said you would check the number of symmetries that<br/>occur with my scale.

It&apos;s not symmetric<br/>around 3/2 or 2/1.  Going to half-step interval  sizes I see step sizes of about<br/>1) 1.07<br/>2. 1.044<br/>3) 1.0666<br/>4) 1.075<br/>5) 1.0689<br/>   Now you could narrow those down to<br/>1. 1.07<br/>2. 1.045</p><p>...to get<br/>L(1.07)s(1.11815)L(1.1964)s(1.2502)L(1.3375)s(1.39768)L(1.4955)<br/>L(1.60)s(1.672)L(1.789)s(1.8695)L(2.0)</p><p>    Now if you look at my (&quot;MOS&quot; estimated) version of your scale you&apos;ll notice<br/>the step sizes are symmetric around BOTH 2/1 and 3/2 with two L&apos;s, one L on each<br/>side, of 2/1 and 3/2.  Though I can&apos;t say it&apos;s strictly MOS because I can&apos;t find<br/>a single obvious generator that can create the entire scale, despite it having<br/>two interval sizes.</p><p>   I ran into this sort of issue with one of my old scale IE it could be rounded<br/>VERY closely to an MOS.  The only thing is mine could be rounded to Mohajira<br/>(7-tone MOS) while I&apos;m not sure if yours can be rounded to anything in existence<br/>in particular...though I&apos;m sure some of the experts on the list could tell you<br/>quickly if there&apos;s a &quot;well-known&quot; MOS your scale rounded very well to.</p></div><h3><a id=90692 href="#90692">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2010 7:33:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1.0, 1.07274, 1.122938, 1.198533, 1.25153, 1.335782, 1.398289,<br/>&gt; 1.5, 1.602938, 1.671566, 1.794724, 1.871563, 2.0.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note: I almost NEVER express things in terms of cents anymore because<br/>&gt; maintaining 12TET-like intervals is not the goal of my tunings.</p><p>Cents strike me as preferable because it is easier to see what the intervals are and easier to stuff into Scala.

Since most people in the Western world entering the microtonal field are familiar with the 12-tET standard, it makes it easy for them to compare new intervals with familiar ones.</p><p>2) Simpler arithmetic: you can add and subtract cents, but you have to multiply  and divide decimals.  It&apos;s much easier to add and subtract complex numbers mentally than it is to multiply and divide decimals.</p><p>3) More applicable when retuning various 12-tET-centric synths: some popular retunable synths out there offer a +/- cents slider on each of the 12 keys.  This is great for people who don&apos;t know how to (or can&apos;t) use MIDI tuning standard, Scala, LMSO, or other retuning tools.  In fact, it&apos;s pretty much the ONLY way I&apos;ve ever made non-guitar-based microtonal music (and I prefer it, since all of my input devices--piano roll, keyboard, etc--are designed for 12-note scales).</p><p>4) Linear incrementation: say you have two cents values that differ by a given amount, like 300 cents and 315 cents.  That difference of 15 means the same thing as the 15 cents between 800 and 815 cents.  With decimal values, the 0.01 difference between 1.1 and 1.11 is NOT the same as the 0.01 difference between 1.8 and 1.81, because decimal values are on a logarithmic scale.  So if you&apos;re comparing intervals, you can&apos;t do a simple &quot;visual evaluation&quot;, you have to bust out the calculator and do some division.  This relates to number 2), and is just another way that using decimal values is more computationally-intensive on the average musician.</p><p>5) A bias toward 12-tET is preferable toward a bias toward simple decimals: I don&apos;t really believe using cents values biases anyone toward using near-12-tET values--that&apos;s utter nonsense, really--but if it DOES, then using decimal should bias people toward using scales with short/simple decimals.  If the &quot;ideal&quot; cents scale is 12-tET, then the &quot;ideal&quot; decimal scale is 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0.  To suggest that decimal notation is any more &quot;tuning-neutral&quot; than cents is obviously mistaken.  If there&apos;s going to be a &quot;bias&quot;, it might as well be a bias toward a system familiar to the &quot;average musician&quot;, rather than to a novel system unfamiliar to most.</p><p>Michael, since you are so bent on popularizing microtonality, how can you honestly be suggesting a measurement system that is drastically more difficult to learn and apply (for the &quot;average musician&quot;) than the familiar cents system?</p><p>Oh, and here&apos;s a great site that I have bookmarked to convert all sorts of musical measurements back and forth:<br/><a href="http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-centsratio.htm">http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-centsratio.htm</a></p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;Cents strike me as preferable because it is easier to see what the<br/>&gt; intervals are and easier to stuff into Scala.

The<br/>&gt; cents system is based around the 100 cents = 12TET semitone idea.  This helps<br/>&gt; narrow down the tendency to rate scales by how much they are like 12TET instead<br/>&gt; of how well they work and that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy (IE<br/>&gt; scales made using cents are often rated by their &quot;12TET-ish-ness&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) They can be used in any type programming without conversion to and from<br/>&gt; cents.  This makes it faster for programmers to write new easy-to-use tuning<br/>&gt; software.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) There&apos;s no learning curve for decimal the way there is cents...you have to<br/>&gt; teach people what a cents is and how to convert to/from cents. Cents is only<br/>&gt; used in music, most people already know decimal format from the countless forms<br/>&gt; of math and science which use it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) If you want to round decimal values to fractions ALA JI you can use<br/>&gt; calculators like<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/fracs.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/fracs.html</a>.<br/>&gt;   I haven&apos;t seen such a thing as a &quot;cent to fraction&quot; program...likely due to<br/>&gt; difficulties mentioned in #2.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=90791 href="#90791">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2010 7:47:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>I&apos;ll say this much</p><p>&gt;&quot;2) Simpler arithmetic: you can add and subtract cents, but you have to multiply<br/>&gt;and divide decimals.

And then there are several intervals like 22/15 which have<br/>names like &quot;uni-decimal diminished fifth&quot; and 13/9 or &quot;tri-decimal diminished<br/>fifth&quot;, but then you have things like 50/33 which is called &quot;3 penta-tones&quot;<br/>(wouldn&apos;t something like &apos;augmented 5th&apos; be more appropriate).

Average musicians know jack-s*** about psychoacoustics, frequency ratios, and decimal representations of musical intervals.  What they do know is cents.  Relating intervals back to cents helps make the intervals more intelligible to the average musician.  Any other system of representing musical intervals means a steeper learning curve, and a steeper learning curve makes for a more difficult sales-pitch.  And for those of us who have already learned cents values, we are generally satisfied enough with them.  I mean, come on...if GENE of all people prefers cents values, doesn&apos;t that tell you something about the appeal of cents?</p><p>The bottom line is that musicians understand cents.  Teaching frequency ratios is an important first step, because without that, people won&apos;t understand why 12-tET is &quot;out-of-tune&quot; or in what ways any other system might be &quot;in-tune&quot;.  But trying to teach frequency ratios WITHOUT also bringing cents into the equation will leave most musicians totally confused, because they have nothing familiar to relate these ideas to.  5/4 = 1.2500000000000000, and (2^(1/12))^4 = 1.2599210498948732, but what do you expect that 0.0099210498948732 difference to MEAN to an average musician?  If you limit your representation of the ratio to 5 significant figures (which is a whole lot more aesthetically pleasing than a long string of numbers like you usually use in your decimal notation), you get 1.2600 due to rounding, which doesn&apos;t look any more complex than 1.2500.  Tell them 5/4 = 386.3137138648348 cents (or just round it to 386.31) and they can see, &quot;oh, it&apos;s almost 14&cent; lower than 400&cent;!  That&apos;s more than an eighth of a semitone!&quot;</p><p>And before you protest any further, I should remind you that your proposed interval taxonomy--</p><p>&gt; There would be a diminished, minor, major, and augmented<br/>&gt; (sub-class) version for every tonal class in that order.  I figure you can&apos;t get<br/>&gt; much easier to learn and memorize than that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   If you use the basic concepts of minor and major 2nd through 7th, it basically<br/>&gt; would give you the standard 7-tone major scale in 12TET...but using<br/>&gt; diminished/minor/major/augmented would hopefully give you almost every interval<br/>&gt; imaginable within about 10 cents.</p><p>--is biased toward diatonic scales, or scales with 7 general interval classes anyway.  Just as insidious as whatever &quot;bias&quot; toward 12-tET the cents system has.</p><p>And for what it&apos;s worth, speaking of &quot;aesthetic appeal&quot;, your decimal system would render ANY tempered interval as a mess of numbers, no matter how slight the tempering.

And even then, a major scale is not 100, 200, 300...it&apos;s more<br/>like 0, 200, 400, 500, etc.  It all comes back to memorization and, honestly, I<br/>don&apos;t things it&apos;s any easier to memorize.

For the record 1.25 in decimal is<br/>again simpler then 1.25992...hence again pointing to decimals as pointing to<br/>more accurate simplicities than cents.  The musician may not understand the<br/>psycho-acoustic/periodicity behind 1.25 vs. 1.25992...but he can see 1.25 as<br/>more aesthetically pleasing and easier to memorize.</p><p>Me&gt; There would be a diminished, minor, major, and augmented<br/>&gt; (sub-class) version for every tonal class in that order.  I figure you can&apos;t<br/>&gt;get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; much easier to learn and memorize than that.<br/>Igs&gt;&quot;(that) is biased toward diatonic scales, or scales with 7 general interval<br/>classes anyway. Just as insidious as whatever &quot;bias&quot; toward 12-tET the cents<br/>system has.&quot;<br/>   No it isn&apos;t.  There is no 22/15 in the diatonic system, I just used the term<br/>&quot;diminished&quot; to describe it because I figured it would be instantly recognizable<br/>to musicians as &quot;the lower, often more dissonant, version of the tone&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And for what it&apos;s worth, speaking of &quot;aesthetic appeal&quot;, your decimal system<br/>&gt;would render ANY tempered interval as a mess of numbers, no matter how slight<br/>&gt;the tempering. So anyone working with ANY FORM OF TEMPERAMENT (read: damn near<br/>&gt;everyone on this list, save for the few JI purists) would find an &quot;ugly mess&quot; of<br/>&gt;decimal values&quot;</p><p>   That would completely ignore my repeated suggestion of using interval classes<br/>for both decimals and fractions.  So let&apos;s say you have an easily memorize-able<br/>fairly pure decimal value such as 1.666...<br/>  You could easily teach someone to think of 1.67 as an estimate of 1.66666 as<br/>easily teach them that taking 1.67 / 1.6666 = 1.002 and that anything under<br/>1.005 off is often not audibly different.</p><p>&gt;&quot;At least with cents, there are plenty of temperaments that can be represented<br/>&gt;with whole numbers of cents.&quot;<br/>  In that case, why would, say 132 cents be easier to memorize or digest than<br/>1.32 as a value?

Your original argument was for decimal ONLY, against cents ONLY, and it fell apart right quick (you acknowledged that decimal is not tuning-neutral, it has a bias toward JI, and that you need to include ratios and interval classes to make it work with tempered music).  You keep trying to change your argument every time I point out a flaw or contradiction, and I&apos;d like you to stop this sophistry.</p><p>What you seem to be arguing now is that it&apos;s better to have a bias toward JI than a bias toward 12-tET, which is a very different argument than you were advancing in the beginning.  Allow me to show you how this argument is self-defeating.</p><p>First, consider your premise that using cents causes a bias toward 12-tET because cents values with many numbers in them are less aesthetically-pleasing (and look more &quot;out of tune&quot;) than cents values with few numbers in them.  IOW, in cents values, 0400.0 cents looks &quot;nicer&quot; and more in-tune than 0386.3 cents.  You argue that even a cents value of 0433.0 cents is &quot;less aesthetically pleasing&quot; than 400 cents, and so will bias people against it.</p><p>Using this same principle, I can show that decimal has a bias ONLY toward the harmonic series 10:11:12:13:14:15:16:17:18:19:20 (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc.), and against most other JI intervals.  Consider that in decimal, a simple ratio like 8/7 comes out to 1.1429 (rounded to 5 sig-figs)--in fact, any ratio with a 7 in the denominator will come out with a messy decimal--does that mean that using decimal notation biases against ratios with a 7 in the denominator?  In fact, even ratios with an 8 in the denominator and an odd numerator will have decimals with four non-zero numbers in it--is decimal biased against these ratios as well?  And what about ratios that can&apos;t be represented with a finite decimal?  Reducing these ratios to a finite decimal, by definition, is a tempering of them.  So for a whole lot of simple JI ratios, using decimal fails miserably.  Now consider decimals like 1.2600, 1.1900, and 1.5100--these intervals are on equal aesthetic footing with intervals like 1.25 and 1.75, but are NOT nearly as nice or in-tune sounding, because they are not simple ratios.  In fact, the first two, 1.2600 and 1.1900, might as well be the 12-tET major and minor thirds--they only miss those intervals by a little over a cent.  So just like cents, decimal gives aesthetic preference to many intervals that are not psychoacoustically-consonant.</p><p>Face it Michael, the logic of your argument leads to absurd conclusions.  Either accept that the bias of which you speak is non-existent, or accept that decimal also causes an unacceptable bias.  Either way, your argument is defeated: if there&apos;s no bias, there&apos;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with cents; if there is bias, then decimal is no better than cents.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Look, Michael, you continually seem to be missing my point.

You&apos;re just not even trying to refute my argument any more.  You&apos;re just blindly insisting that I&apos;m wrong, offering nothing to back it up but your own opinion.  You&apos;re also constantly changing your argument, and then insisting you were NEVER arguing what you previously argued EXPLICITLY.  Do I need to re-post the OP so you can remember what your original argument was?  You&apos;re also not even responding to my actual argument in this post, but to the correction I posted to the PRELUDE to my actual argument!  This is infuriating, and it&apos;s difficult not to resort to petty name-calling with you (maybe you&apos;d actually understand that better).</p><p>&gt; Actually I would agree on it being better to have a bias toward JI.  Both<br/>&gt; because, ultimately, JI at least covers the psycho-acoustic periodicity and<br/>&gt; makes it very easy to memorize tonal classes (including non-diatonic ones!) very<br/>&gt; important to establishing moods in music.  I&apos;d also say 12TET is an effect of<br/>&gt; trying to match JI relationships, rather than the other way around...and that<br/>&gt; many relationships in scale systems other than 12TET can be explained much<br/>&gt; clearer via JI than 12TET.</p><p>There is no argument for decimal here, since I&apos;ve proven it&apos;s NOT biased toward JI but only toward harmonics 10-20.  I&apos;m guessing you never read the previous post, where I actually did the proof.  Please read it!</p><p>&gt; So JI reaches more to the idea &quot;12TET works due to microtonal relationships&quot;<br/>&gt; more than &quot;microtonal works due to 12TET relationships&quot; which IMVHO is a much<br/>&gt; more realistic way to view things.  Human hearing is not based on 12TET, we know<br/>&gt; that much.</p><p>Human hearing hasn&apos;t been proven to be based on JI, either, and it&apos;s certainly not based on harmonics 10 through 20.  Still no argument for why decimal should be kept around.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;What I showed was that, by your definition of &quot;bias&quot;, decimal actually has a<br/>&gt; &gt;bias against JI, except for a particular chunk of the harmonic series. So even<br/>&gt; &gt;if we do want a bias toward JI, decimal doesn&apos;t bring it.&quot;<br/>&gt;   It does have a bias toward rational numbers common in JI IE simpler repeating<br/>&gt; or non-repeating decimals are often low-limit JI fractions.</p><p>If you read my previous post, where I actually did the *proving*, you&apos;d have seen how many examples I pointed out where decimal makes simple low-limit JI fractions look as messy or messier as representing them in cents values.  Let me reiterate some of what I said: Assuming that all values are given to 5 significant figures, all ratios which, in their simplest terms, have a denominator OTHER THAN 2, 4, 5, or 10 are not any &quot;neater-looking&quot; than cents-values for non-12-tET intervals.  The vast majority of simple-looking decimal values, like 1.26, 1.19, 1.51, 1.47, etc., DON&apos;T correspond to simple ratios.  Decimal makes a ratio like 4/3 look MORE COMPLEX than 13/10.  Decimal also makes it impossible to represent most JI ratios precisely without using an infinite number of digits--it&apos;s the same with cents, so there&apos;s no advantage there.  Even for JI, DECIMAL FAILS AS BADLY AS CENTS, according to YOUR OWN STATED CRITERIA.</p><p>&gt; And for about the 20th time<br/>&gt; A) I simply prefer decimal system to cents because it doesn&apos;t explain things<br/>&gt; &quot;relative to or as a product of 12TET&quot;, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the best system</p><p>And now, here&apos;s what&apos;s left of your argument: &quot;decimal is better than cents because it&apos;s not related to 12-tET.&quot;  So now, after I&apos;ve proven that decimal is neither tuning-neutral NOR biased toward JI, you&apos;re reduced to saying, basically, that it&apos;s better than cents because it&apos;s not based on 12-tET.  Not because it&apos;s based on something BETTER than 12-tET (because I&apos;ve shown, again and again, that it&apos;s NOT), just because you don&apos;t like 12-tET.  But you don&apos;t think it&apos;s the &quot;best system&quot; (so I&apos;m presuming you think your &quot;tonal class&quot; system is better)...so really, you started this argument for replacing cents with a &quot;flawed system&quot; INSTEAD OF the system you really believed in?</p><p>Why did you argue for decimal system AT ALL then, if you&apos;ve got something BETTER than it to propose???</p><p>&gt; B) I&apos;m arguing for fractions with descriptions of tonal classes as an ultimate<br/>&gt; system, and NOT the decimal system.</p><p>And for about the 50th time: this was never your original argument, if you look at the OP (or even the TITLE OF THE THREAD), it&apos;s &quot;Cents vs. Decimal&quot;.  You only started arguing for this &quot;tonal class&quot; system after I pointed out the flaws in your argument for decimal.  You just keep back-pedaling and back-pedaling, trying to retroactively change your argument every time you lose ground.  This is sophistry, Michael.  Pick an argument and stick to it, don&apos;t claim you were never arguing for the decimal system.</p><p>If you want to argue about tonal-class-descriptions and ratios as being opposed to cents, that&apos;s nonsense too, because you can&apos;t translate non-JI cents-values OR DECIMALS into RATIO-BASED tonal classes WITHOUT LOSING INFORMATION.  The 28 interval classes (diminished, minor, major, and augmented 1st through 7th = 4 species of 7 intervals = 28 interval classes) you proposed are not remotely detailed enough to describe ALL MUSICAL INTERVALS.  Using that system you propose, I would be unable to represent ANY EQUAL TUNING accurately.  THAT IS NOT AN ADVANTAGE OVER CENTS.</p><p>I&apos;m not doing this anymore.  I can&apos;t make this case any more clear, and if you won&apos;t accept that your arguments are invalid by this point, it&apos;s clear that you&apos;re not interested in logic and prefer to cling childishly and zealously to irrational beliefs.

Which has expanded,<br/>not changed, from my original argument which compared &quot;only&quot; cents and decimals.</p><p>   MY ORIGINAL POST IS AS FOLLOWS (and I think it should be pretty obvious I&apos;ve<br/>only expanded on the topic, and not changed it or contradicted it):<br/>****************************************************<br/>Gene&gt;&quot;Cents strike me as preferable because it is easier to see what the<br/>intervals are and easier to stuff into Scala. What advantage is there to this<br/>floating point system? I don&apos;t see one.&quot;</p><p>   So you&apos;re saying the advantage circles around compatibility with a program<br/>rather than any artistic goal?</p><p>   Here are some advantages to decimal format:</p><p>1) Artistically, it has no bias toward (or against, for that matter) 12TET.  The<br/>cents system is based around the 100 cents = 12TET semitone idea.  This helps<br/>narrow down the tendency to rate scales by how much they are like 12TET instead<br/>of how well they work and that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy (IE<br/>scales made using cents are often rated by their &quot;12TET-ish-ness&quot;).</p><p>2) They can be used in any type programming without conversion to and from<br/>cents.  This makes it faster for programmers to write new easy-to-use tuning<br/>software.</p><p>3) There&apos;s no learning curve for decimal the way there is cents...you have to<br/>teach people what a cents is and how to convert to/from cents. Cents is only<br/>used in music, most people already know decimal format from the countless forms<br/>of math and science which use it.</p><p>4) If you want to round decimal values to fractions ALA JI you can use<br/>calculators like<br/> <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/fracs.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/fracs.html</a>.<br/>  I haven&apos;t seen such a thing as a &quot;cent to fraction&quot; program...likely due to<br/>difficulties mentioned in #2.<br/>*********************************************************************<br/>Igs&gt;&quot;Decimal makes a ratio like 4/3 look MORE COMPLEX than 13/10.  &quot;<br/>  True, but both are actually fairly good so far as consonance.  And, for about<br/>the millionth time, I think FRACTIONS are a superior alternative to decimals and<br/>that my main argument for decimals over cents is how their simplicity often<br/>(though not always!) corresponds to rational ratios which corresponds to JI.<br/>And that relationship is not an opinion: just about anyone on this list can tell<br/>you ratios with terminating or repeating decimals are rational numbers which<br/>have an important place in JI.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And now, here&apos;s what&apos;s left of your argument: &quot;decimal is better than cents<br/>&gt;because it&apos;s not related to 12-tET.&quot;<br/>  No, it also has advantages when it comes to the issue I mentioned above<br/>involving rational numbers and JI.  Plus the learning curve and extra effort of<br/>conversion for programming: you can argue that extra effort isn&apos;t that much, but<br/>it&apos;s still there IE even if it&apos;s limited to calling the centstodecimal C<br/>function mentioned earlier.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Why did you argue for decimal system AT ALL then, if you&apos;ve got something<br/>&gt;BETTER than it to propose???&quot;<br/>  Part of the original argument revolved around Scala&apos;s lack of support for<br/>decimals...that&apos;s why.  I also used the decimal system as an obvious example of<br/>a system with little to no bias toward 12TET...in the same way a fretless guitar<br/>WITHOUT 12TET fret markings would likely prove aesthetically easier to play<br/>non-12TET tunings in than one with the markings.  And that example (which I&apos;ve<br/>mentioned before on this thread) goes straight that to my original post argument<br/>#1, about the 100 cents = 12TET semitone bias in the cent system.  Not only am I<br/>staying on argument, but I&apos;m using IMVHO pretty darn obvious visual examples.</p><p>Me&gt;&gt; B) I&apos;m arguing for fractions with descriptions of tonal classes as an<br/>ultimate</p><p>&gt;&gt; system, and NOT the decimal system.<br/>&gt;And for about the 50th time: this was never your original argument, if you look<br/>&gt;at the OP &gt;(or even the TITLE OF THE THREAD), it&apos;s &quot;Cents vs. Decimal&quot;.</p><p>  Look, get it right: from the beginning I argued for the decimal system for<br/>being less biased than the cent system.  Then you and others complained about<br/>the lack of optimization and simplicity in that system, so we went to discussing<br/>LOGARITHMIC SYSTEMS OTHER THAN CENTS.  Then a few people noted bias in those<br/>systems toward other TET&apos;s and I noted that virtually ALL low-numbered<br/>logarithmic systems had such bias.</p><p>  We then EXPANDED the argument to include the system of fractions and classes,<br/>which (as you&apos;ve agreed) have a bit of a JI bias...but are highly optimized and<br/>(at least) have a bias that most often does not favor TET&apos;s vs. non-TET&apos;s.  And<br/>my final conclusion was that the fraction system should be supplemented by a<br/>simple list of tonal classes that follows an obvious order (IE no guessing if,<br/>for example, a &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;major&quot; version of a tone is higher.  But you never<br/>responded to that, just shifted the argument right back to decimal vs. cents,<br/>apparently ignoring the evolution of the argument.</p><p>&gt;&quot;If you want to argue about tonal-class-descriptions and ratios as being opposed<br/>&gt;to cents, that&apos;s nonsense too, because you can&apos;t translate non-JI cents-values<br/>&gt;OR DECIMALS into RATIO-BASED tonal classes WITHOUT LOSING INFORMATION.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>  When I described my class system, I described classes as boundaries.<br/>  And I&apos;d still vouch, you can make fractions in form xxx/xxx without losing<br/>more than a cent of information in most cases.  People on this list do that all<br/>the time.<br/>  For an exact example 22/15 AKA 1.46666 may be the lower limit for a &quot;fifth&quot;<br/>and 50/33 AKA 1.515 the upper limit.<br/>  Now suppose you get a really high limit fraction like 303/200.  Take 301/200 =<br/>1.505 and compare it to 1.46666 and 1.515.  It&apos;s right in between and hence in<br/>the same class.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not doing this anymore. I can&apos;t make this case any more clear, and if you<br/>&gt;won&apos;t accept that your arguments are invalid by this point,&quot;<br/>  You haven&apos;t proved much more than</p><p>A) My points are invalid to you (at least I&apos;ve given specific numeric and visual<br/>examples of my points)<br/>B) You can&apos;t seem to accept that this argument has expanded BEYOND simply<br/>comparing decimals and cents and has evolved into discussion fraction and<br/>logarithmic systems OTHER than cents which solve problems that occur with both<br/>cents and the decimal system.<br/>  It&apos;s as if you did not read ANY of the follow-ups on this thread except the<br/>original message.</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=90848 href="#90848">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2010 3:40:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris&gt;&quot;It took you this long to figure it out?
