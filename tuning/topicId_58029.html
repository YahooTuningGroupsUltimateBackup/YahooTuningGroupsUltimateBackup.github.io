An entire opera in<br/>three acts, &quot;Danton and Robespierre,&quot; complete with, like, a<br/>250-member chorus and an orchestra with two sets of woodwinds a<br/>quartertone apart, and three harps or pianos or something sixth-tones<br/>apart.  And a synthesizer in 12-note JI used to represent the purity<br/>of Robespierre&apos;s ideals and how they get &quot;out of tune&quot; as he gets all<br/>terror-crazed.  Yes, the most banal way of using JI, but still,<br/>polymicrotonality, 1980-style.  Pretty cool.  And quite noisy, just<br/>like the French Revolution.)</p><p>-Jacob</p></div><h3><a id=58030 href="#58030">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2005 2:11:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>&quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, what&apos;s up with there not<br/>being any recordings of Joel<br/>Mandelbaum&apos;s music that I can<br/>find?

The AFMM has put on a number of his<br/>microtonal works, and Joel is on the AFMM board of directors.  We lost our<br/>champion microtonal hornist due to illness and have had to put off a second<br/>performance of his second Wind Quintet in 31-tone ET.  Joel long ago lost his interest<br/>in 19-tet in preference of 31-tet.</p><p>Having worked with John Eaton over the past several years (he&apos;s written 2<br/>pieces for the AFMM), they are quite different from each other, more like<br/>opposites.</p><p>Joel has a CD in 12-tet for voice and piano.  He is into the pure Just<br/>hamonies that exemplify the 7th harmonic.  When he uses it, he means it.  John would<br/>use that interval more in passing, surrounded by busyness, and plenty of<br/>&quot;stochasticism.&quot;  John is more inclined towards noise and Joel is more concerned<br/>with pure consonance.</p><p>all best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director/AFMM</p></div>
