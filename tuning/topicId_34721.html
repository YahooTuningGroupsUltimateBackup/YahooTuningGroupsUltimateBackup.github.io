Werckmeister&apos;s mention that no. iv (based on 1/3 comma) is in his<br/>book Orgel-Probe is only for its first edition.  In the second edition, which<br/>is the one that received wide distribution, all issues on tuning are referred<br/>to &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; and this is the case for every single book to<br/>follow.  It is even included in the posthumous publication of his &quot;Musical<br/>Paradox.&quot;</p><p>What is increasingly amazing to me now is that Johann Cristoph Bach (the<br/>uncle living kitty-corner to J.S. in Eisenach) never criticized Werckmeister<br/>(though others surely did).
