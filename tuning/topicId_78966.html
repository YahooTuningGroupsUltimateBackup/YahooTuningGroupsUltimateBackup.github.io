Currently, only members<br/>of your group can see the messages there.<br/>No I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If it truly is beneath you to join my group, or join my group and immediately quit as has been done on this list, just send me an email and I will send you some material.<br/>In this group you can go here:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/78854">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/78854</a><br/>and review my position that sine waves and points of resolution are pretty much worthless in evaluating a chords degree of consonance.<br/>Small integers are also pretty much useless.&nbsp;<br/>WHY?<br/>Let&rsquo;s take one of my more consonant chords which has a coefficient of consonance of 0.60952389.&nbsp; It has 1 4 3 4 steps, or (16/15)(5/4)(6/5)(5/4).&nbsp; The integers add up to 60.&nbsp;<br/>(16/15)(5/4)(6/5)(5/4) (16/15)(5/4)(6/5)(5/4).<br/>Now let&rsquo;s multiply adjacent intervals together over two octaves and see what happens.<br/>(4/3)(3/2)(3/2)(4/3)(4/3)(3/2)(3/2)<br/>Now let&rsquo;s multiply each of three adjacent intervals together over the same two octaves and see what happens.<br/>(8/5)(15/8)(8/5)(5/3)(8/5)(15/8)<br/>Of course, when you multiply each of four adjacent intervals together over two octaves, you get;<br/>(2/1) (2/1) (2/1) (2/1) (2/1)<br/>No let&rsquo;s take another one of my chords that has a coefficient of consonance of 0.674157303.<br/>4 3 2 3&nbsp; (5/4)(6/5)(10/9)(6/5)<br/>The integers add up to 50.&nbsp; This chord is less consonant even though the integers are smaller.<br/>(5/4)(6/5)(10/9)(6/5) (5/4)(6/5)(10/9)(6/5)<br/>Now let&rsquo;s multiply adjacent intervals together over two octaves and see what happens.<br/>(3/2)(4/3)(4/3)(3/2)(3/2)(4/3)(4/3)<br/>Now let&rsquo;s multiply each of three adjacent intervals together over the same two octaves and see what happens.<br/>(5/3)(8/5)(5/3)(9/5)(5/3)(8/5)<br/>Of course, when you multiply each of four adjacent intervals together over two octaves, you get;<br/>(2/1) (2/1) (2/1) (2/1) (2/1)<br/>To summarize, for the chord 1 4 3 4 you get a coefficient of consonance of 0.60952389, which is more consonant than the chord 4 3 2 3 which has a coefficient of consonance of 0.674157303.&nbsp; Add up the digits of the fractions that make up 1 4 3 4 and you get 60.&nbsp; For the chord 4 3 2 3 you get 50.&nbsp; Add up the integers of the fractions for all intervals over two octaves, excluding all 2/1 and you get 254 for the more consonant chord 1 4 3 4, and you get 207 for the less consonant chord 4 3 2 3.<br/>Let&rsquo;s try this again using only the chord in question.<br/>(5/4)(6/5)(10/9)(6/5)<br/>(3/2)(4/3)(4/3)<br/>(5/3)(8/5)<br/>2/1<br/>The integers add up to 93 for the chord 4 3 2 3.<br/>(16/15)(5/4)(6/5)(5/4)<br/>(4/3)(3/2)(3/2)<br/>(8/5)(15/8)<br/>2/1<br/>The integers add up to 116 for the chord 1 4 3 4.<br/>The integers are clearly larger in the more consonant chord and smaller in the less consonant chord.&nbsp; So how often does this happen?&nbsp; More often than not!<br/>So I have concluded that sine waves and the point of resolution cannot be used to measure consonance, and the size of the integers cannot be used to measure consonance.&nbsp; So the question begs, how do you measure consonance?&nbsp; The coefficient of consonance!<br/>Oh, did I forget to point out that you can&rsquo;t hear the dissonance in the 16/15 interval because it is in consonance with a tone an octave higher.&nbsp; The seven step intervals in 1 4 3 4 are more consonant than the five step intervals in 4 3 2 3.&nbsp; Go ahead and try it by ear if you don&rsquo;t believe me.<br/>News you can use.<br/>C (9/8) D (10/9) E (6/5) G (5/4) B (16/15) C<br/>C (5/4) E (6/5) G (10/9) A (9/8) B (16/15) C<br/>C (5/4) E (16/15) F (9/8) G (10/9) A (6/5) C<br/>C (10/9) D (9/8) E (16/15) F (5/4) A (6/5) C<br/>Note that the placement of the D is different in the first set of notes than the last set of notes, and that there is a C and an E is in every set of notes.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you cannot use the first set of notes at the same time as the last set of notes.&nbsp; You can only use three systems at a time.&nbsp; But you can jump off one set of notes onto another at C and E.&nbsp; Of course, you can jump from one system&rsquo;s F G A or B to another system&rsquo;s F G A or B if both systems have the desired jump off point.&nbsp;<br/>If you follow this procedure, it will be impossible to play a dissonant interval.&nbsp; Note that you can also delete a note at any time by multiplying together adjacent intervals.&nbsp;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/3/2008 12:59:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
