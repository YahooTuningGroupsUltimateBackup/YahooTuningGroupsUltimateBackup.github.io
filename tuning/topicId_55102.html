In fact, you could do it<br/>&gt; all with wild cards: det([|* 4 -1&gt;, |* 0 -3&gt;]) = -12,<br/>&gt; det([|-4 * -1&gt;, |7 * -3&gt;]) = 19, det([|-4 4 *&gt;, |7 0 *&gt;]) =-28; which<br/>&gt; are of course minors. This seems to be what you do below, you may as<br/>&gt; well start out with it.</p><p>Yes, I need the wild cards - will put them in. Don&apos;t want to use Det though<br/>as too techy. I try to avoid using the word determinant here - every use of a<br/>techy math term will stop a newbie in their tracks if they haven&apos;t<br/>learnt it yet.</p><p>Here is my latest definition, and I&apos;ve changed it<br/>around again, somewhat back the way it was originally,<br/>and start by explaining what a wedge<br/>product is mathematically but simply.<br/>Then one carefully chosen example from first principles.</p><p>=term=<br/>wedge product</p><p>=definition=<br/>The wedge product x/\y of two vectors x and y is the area<br/>swept out from one to the other. So it is an<br/>area with a sense of direction and x /\y = - y/\x.<br/>A vector is made up of unit vectors for two or more<br/>directions of travel - similarly a wedge product<br/>of vectors is made up of wedge products of unit vectors.</p><p>One example of its use in tuning theory is to find out the<br/>area or volume of a periodicity block. To do that you<br/>write out the monzos in the form of a sum of unit vectors<br/>then multiply them out using two rules: ei/\ei = 0 (area 0)<br/>and because it is a directed area, ei/\ej = - ej/\ei<br/>You can only change the order of the unit vectors using the<br/>second rule.</p><p>Example:<br/>tridecimal diesis 26/25 = [* 0, -2 * *, 1&gt; = (-2e2 + e3)<br/>syntonic comma 81/80 = [* 4, -1 * *, 0&gt; = (4e1 - e2)<br/>schisma [* 8, 1&gt; = (8e1 + e2)<br/>(-2e2 + e3) /\ (4e1 - e2) /\ (8e1 + e2)<br/>= (-2e2 + e3) /\ (4e12 -8e21)<br/>= (-2e2 + e3) /\ (-12e21)<br/>= -12 e321<br/>An example would be David Canright&apos;s<br/>13 limit twelve tone scale.<br/>You can simplify this calculation<br/>by using the diesis in place of the schisma.</p><p>Well the best I can do at present. Don&apos;t know how many<br/>hours it took me :-).</p><p>Be sure to say if anything there is unclearly<br/>expressed or of course if there is a<br/>typo or something not correct.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2004 12:39:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Example:<br/>&gt; tridecimal diesis 26/25 = [* 0, -2 * *, 1&gt; = (-2e2 + e3)<br/>&gt; syntonic comma 81/80 = [* 4, -1 * *, 0&gt; = (4e1 - e2)<br/>&gt; schisma [* 8, 1&gt; = (8e1 + e2)</p><p>Would this be clearer as [* 8, 1 * *, 0&gt;?</p><p>&gt; (-2e2 + e3) /\ (4e1 - e2) /\ (8e1 + e2)<br/>&gt; = (-2e2 + e3) /\ (4e12 -8e21)<br/>&gt; = (-2e2 + e3) /\ (-12e21)<br/>&gt; = -12 e321<br/>&gt; An example would be David Canright&apos;s<br/>&gt; 13 limit twelve tone scale.</p><p>Is Canright&apos;s scale a Fokker block using these commas?
