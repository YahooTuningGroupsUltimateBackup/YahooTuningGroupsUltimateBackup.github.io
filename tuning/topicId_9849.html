Carr on the hexachord fantasia by John Bull. More<br/>generally, this thread raises the issues of possible intonational<br/>solutions for Elizabethan and Jacobean virginals music using<br/>accidentals outside the most usual meantone range of Eb-G#.</p><p>Since shorter articles often tend to invite easier feedback, I&apos;ll try<br/>to keep my comments here reasonably concise, with the explicit<br/>intention of inviting lots of feedback, questions, and further<br/>dialogue.</p><p>First of all, Paul asked whether the &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; G#-Eb ever gets used<br/>in Renaissance and Manneristic music (say 1420-1640). Here I would<br/>reply that the indicated use of such impure fifths or fourths is to my<br/>best knowledge confined in this period to a few pieces for an<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; keyboard such as Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo (1555) or<br/>Colonna&apos;s Sambuca Lincea (1618) dividing the whole-tone into five<br/>parts. While Vicentino himself generally prefers to avoid such<br/>imperfect fifths or fourths both in theory and known practice, they do<br/>occur in an anonymous Portuguese keyboard piece brought to our<br/>attention here by Johnny Reinhart, and also in some examples by<br/>Colonna.</p><p>In contrast, the use of regularly spelled fifths and other intervals<br/>outside the most common 12-note range of Eb-G# occurs from at least<br/>the later 14th century on (e.g. Ab-Eb). For example, the famous<br/>_Fumeux fume_ of Solage uses a 15-note range of Gb-G# (although this<br/>is not a keyboard piece), and in the early 15th century Prosdocimus of<br/>Beldemandis and Ugolino of Orvieto endorse a 17-note range of Gb-A#.</p><p>Here it should be emphasized that while Eb-G# is indeed the most usual<br/>range in medieval and Renaissance compositions, theorists such as<br/>Ramos (1482) and Schlick (1511) actually prefer Ab to G# in a 12-note<br/>tuning.</p><p>Ramos thus prefers Ab-C# for a 12-note keyboard, although he adds that<br/>some musicians like to support both sides of the G#/Ab question by<br/>adding a split key providing both accidentals; this happens in<br/>practice on the Lucca organ of the 1480&apos;s with Ab/G# and Eb/D#.</p><p>Schlick, as I mentioned in an earlier post, prefers a kind of 12-note<br/>kludge in which a single lever provides a reasonably tolerable Ab or a<br/>marginally acceptable G# for use in quick running passages.</p><p>Pieces calling for intervals outside the most common 12-note meantone<br/>range Eb-G# might be placed in three general categories:</p><p>              (1) Pieces fitting within a 12-note chain of fifths<br/>                  other than Eb-G#: e.g. Ab-C# or Bb-D#. For such<br/>                  pieces, retuning an accidental or two on a<br/>                  12-note meantone instrument should solve the<br/>                  problem.</p><p>              (2) Pieces calling for around 13-15 notes per<br/>                  octave, e.g. using both Ab/G#, Eb/D#, or<br/>                  Bb/A#. Here an instrument with two or<br/>                  three split keys can solve the problem;<br/>                  and an approximation of well-temperament<br/>                  such as Schlick&apos;s might also be a possible<br/>                  solution in some cases.</p><p>              (3) Pieces calling for more extended keyboards,<br/>                  for example a &quot;chromatic harpsichord&quot; with<br/>                  19 notes or an archicembalso with 31 notes --<br/>                  or, possibly, some thorough well-temperament<br/>                  scheme.</p><p>Of course, these are rough and very general categories, and pieces may<br/>have some interesting nuances.</p><p>First of all, Dale&apos;s remarks may reflect a view also expressed in some<br/>modern editions of virginals music that the use of notes outside a usual<br/>meantone range may suggest some kind of well-temperament. I certainly<br/>wouldn&apos;t venture to exclude this possibility, although Mark Lindley, for<br/>example, concludes that a keyboard of more than 12 notes is the more<br/>probable and preferable solution.</p><p>One possible piece of evidence is provided by Thomas Morley (1597),<br/>who in a discussion of the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera<br/>notes that on the virginals G# could not serve as the equivalent of<br/>Ab, since the former note would be more than 1/8-tone lower than the<br/>latter. He mentions a kind of virginals called &quot;chromatica,&quot; which are<br/>actually &quot;half enharmonica&quot; -- that is, likely, which have an<br/>enharmonic diesis between such alternative accidentals as G#/Ab or<br/>Eb/D#. Such a passage suggests to me that such instruments might have<br/>been known in England as well as on the Continent of Europe.</p><p>In the case of Bull&apos;s piece, I thank Dale for his very important<br/>correction to my remark about the piece using &quot;five flats and five<br/>sharps.&quot; In fact, as Dale points out, it uses Cb as well as E#.</p><p>If I am correct in reading the overall range as Cb-E#, then two kinds<br/>of solutions involving an extended keyboard in 19-note meantone are<br/>possible. Quite seriously, I would warn that I cannot guarantee that<br/>in reading a transcription I might not have overlooked an odd<br/>accidental somewhere, so I welcome corrections on this point.</p><p>On a 19-note keyboard tuned in a temperament at or near 1/4-comma<br/>(pure major thirds), one could simply alter the usual range of Gb-B#<br/>by retuning the B# key up a diesis (128:125 or ~41.06 cents in this<br/>temperament) to Cb. This is the same kind of solution as retuning a<br/>12-note instrument from Eb-G# to Ab-C# or Bb-D# if a piece requires<br/>it.</p><p>On a 19-tet keyboard like that described by Costeley (1570), there<br/>would be no problem, because in this tuning B#=Cb (and likewise<br/>E#=Fb). However, Lindley for example suggests that English music of<br/>this era may lean to a temperament of somewhat _less_ than 1/4-comma,<br/>say about 1/5-comma, which produces a &quot;sprightly&quot; effect with some<br/>virginals music -- as opposed to a full 1/3-comma.</p><p>On a 31-note keyboard such as that of Vicentino or Colonna, of course,<br/>Cb would be included, so again there would be no problem.</p><p>Curiously, Lindley&apos;s hypothesis of an English penchant for<br/>temperaments of around 1/5-comma raises the possibility of a 12-note<br/>compromise scheme such as Schlick&apos;s. Possibly Dowland&apos;s scheme of<br/>well-temperament for a lute might be relevant, although two cautions<br/>could be in line.</p><p>First, Vincenzo Galilei draws a distinction between the harpsichord<br/>and lute which could be relevant for well-tempered schemes as well as<br/>12-tet: he finds that 12-tet, although fine for the lute and ideally<br/>symmetrical, is less &quot;supportable&quot; on a harpsichord with its different<br/>string materials and plucking action. In modern terms, the fifth<br/>partial is more prominent on an instrument such as harpsichord (or<br/>organ). Thus a scheme such as 12-tet, or a well-temperament with<br/>prominent thirds near Pythagorean, might be routine for a lute (where<br/>12-tet is the standard tuning by around 1545) but questionable for<br/>keyboard instruments.</p><p>Secondly, Schlick&apos;s scheme is designed to permit a marginal use of G#<br/>in ornamental cadential passages; Lindley suggests an interpretation<br/>of this scheme in which Ab-C is comparable to 12-tet and E-G# to<br/>Pythagorean. Schlick&apos;s comments suggest that Pythagorean or<br/>near-Pythagorean thirds were not regarded as very satisfactory for<br/>sustained sonorities, although the judgment of Werckmeister&apos;s era<br/>might be more tolerant.</p><p>A final note on meantone tunings: Bull&apos;s piece may serve as an<br/>illustration of how retuning an odd accidental can solve the problem<br/>of making a composition fit on a _relatively_ &quot;small&quot; keyboard. Thus<br/>while the piece seems outside the usual 19-note Neapolitan &quot;chromatic<br/>harpsichord&quot; range of Gb-B#, retuning B# to Cb permits things to &quot;fit&quot;<br/>nicely.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s known examples in the enharmonic genus (with fifthtone<br/>intervals) may also illustrate this point. While Vicentino&apos;s<br/>archicembalo has 31 notes, I was pleased to find any one of his<br/>examples can fit on a keyboard with &quot;only&quot; 24 notes per octave, very<br/>convenient when using two regular 12-note synthesizer keyboards.</p><p>How one sorts out all these possibilities may be in part a matter of<br/>viewpoint. Thus modern writers who favor 12-tet or some unequal<br/>12-note well-temperament may take virginals music as a step in this<br/>direction; those who favor meantone tunings of more than 12 notes per<br/>octave may prefer a solution of this kind. Morley at least suggests<br/>that &quot;chromatic&quot; virginals like the 19-note harpsichords of Naples<br/>were known to English readers.</p><p>While Bull&apos;s piece is an especially adventurous one, it might be<br/>interesting to see how many virginals pieces require both Ab/G# or<br/>Eb/D#, and how many using notes outside Eb-G# might fit within an<br/>alternative 12-note tuning (e.g. Ab-C# or Bb-D#). Such an<br/>investigation, while it might not point to a definitive answer, might<br/>help us in better assessing the intonation question.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
