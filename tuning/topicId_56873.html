But that is not the whole story.  Consonance also<br/>has a lot to do with how the information from the cochlea is<br/>interpreted by the brain.</p><p>By &quot;simplicity&quot;, do you mean the size of the ratio describing an<br/>interval?  This is in fact an excellent predictor of consonance<br/>among dyads whose ratios have numerators and denominators less<br/>than about 10-15.  This doesn&apos;t work for ratios like 30001:20001<br/>due to the phenomenon of &apos;approximation&apos; -- the ear is very<br/>forgiving in its search for justly-intoned intervals.</p><p>See my earlier post for recommended readings.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Igliashon Jones &#x3C;igliashon@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2005 1:12:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;m not familiar with any such work.

Following along these lines i did quite a bit of music based on different inversions of the same chord ( usually 4 factors) arranged in consonance and dissonance curves. The system i found worked the best for me was taking the sum of all the difference tones and the generating intervals and omitting the duplicates. This seem to work better than just a straight addition and worked better that more involved math. An empirical way to evaluate this system is the arrangement which goes from most consonant to most dissonant. which can be seen and tested with this piece.<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/lullaby.html">http://anaphoria.com/lullaby.html</a><br/>the most trouble it has is with the first line or two since it is hard to measure a dissonant of a single note :) yet it all fails perfectly into place. My girlfriend at the time i could predict what her threshold would be before she would get uncomfortable, usually within a few numbers from this list. These pieces of which this was only one  enabled one to teach players only a few tones and their octaves. their being more reluctance to such things at the time<br/>   Regardless more test should possibly be done yet find this method more fruitful than any of the &quot;lattice &quot; distance methods because it takes into consideration that different inversions are different chords.<br/>I have since abandoned research and composition along these lines . While it greatly broaden my palette to different inversions ( there are always those we just don&apos;t think of) i found trying to incorporate it all the time into actual music became more burdensome than not and found , one can easily increase tension at will by so many different factors , that having to charts ones course before taking a step was just too big a price to pay.<br/>   Still it exposed my ear and imagination to what can be done with such methods , so once one does it, we hopefully absorb it intuitively.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 1         &gt;<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:igliashon@sbcglobal.net">igliashon@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Porcupine-8 tonal theory; sum/difference tones and consonance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For those that don&apos;t know me from MMM, my name&apos;s Igliashon Jones and &gt;I&apos;ve been studying microtonal music for about 10 months now.

Even<br/>&gt;when they are audible, in my experience they are heard as a<br/>&gt;separate sensation on top of whatever consonance (or lack<br/>&gt;thereof) would otherwise be there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Consonance has traditionally been explained by critical-band<br/>&gt;roughness -- a feature of the spectral analysis done in the<br/>&gt;cochlea.  But that is not the whole story.  Consonance also<br/>&gt;has a lot to do with how the information from the cochlea is<br/>&gt;interpreted by the brain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By &quot;simplicity&quot;, do you mean the size of the ratio describing an<br/>&gt;interval?  This is in fact an excellent predictor of consonance<br/>&gt;among dyads whose ratios have numerators and denominators less<br/>&gt;than about 10-15.  This doesn&apos;t work for ratios like 30001:20001<br/>&gt;due to the phenomenon of &apos;approximation&apos; -- the ear is very<br/>&gt;forgiving in its search for justly-intoned intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;See my earlier post for recommended readings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 8         &gt;   Date: Sun, 06 Feb 2005 09:12:58 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:igliashon@sbcglobal.net">igliashon@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Porcupine-8 tonal theory; sum/difference tones and consonance<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m not familiar with any such work.

They&apos;re called &quot;summatiion tones&quot;<br/>because you calculate the sum: 3.1 + 2 = 5.1</p><p>&gt; -- so what you will be hearing<br/>&gt; will be a &quot;G&quot; which is 59 cents sharps -- obviously not meshing with the<br/>&gt; struck &quot;G&quot; an octave below.</p><p>6.2 is in fact the frequency of the second harmonic of the 3.1 note.

The 4:3 would produce the 12th partial</p><p>The 12th partial is over 3-and-a-half-octaves above the fundamental --<br/> it&apos;s really not necessary for tuning a 4:3.</p><p>&gt; (I should say<br/>&gt; PRIMARILY produce, for unless you are using a pure sine-wave for<br/>are other<br/>&gt; less-strong partials)</p><p>Sine waves have no partials whatsoever, and it&apos;s most difficult to<br/>tune such intervals by ear using sine waves. As Aaron Johnston<br/>recently said to me, almost any tuning can sound right with sine-wave<br/>timbres.</p><p>&gt; -- so in the case of a C--F (where &quot;C&quot; is the 3 and<br/>&gt; &quot;F&quot; is the 4) you would want to listen for the &quot;C&quot; two octaves<br/>above (the<br/>&gt; 12th partial).</p><p>The C two octaves above is the 4th partial of the struck &quot;C&quot; and the<br/>3rd partial of the struck &quot;F&quot;. For the tuner to get the C-F to be a<br/>just perfect fourth, they must make these two partials coincide --<br/>typically done by eliminating the beating between them. The presence<br/>or absence of the 12th partial in the timbres is largely irrelevant.</p><p>&gt; But what happens if you don&apos;t hit the 3:2 dead on (i.e. you aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &quot;consonant&quot;) -- let&apos;s say you tune it as a 3.1:2 -- this gives rise<br/>to a<br/>&gt; summation tone at 6.2 (or about 759 cents)</p><p>The actual summation tone, being the sum 3.1 + 2 = 5.1, would be an E<br/>(a major tenth above the C), 21 cents sharp of the equal-tempered E,<br/>or 1621 cents above the struck C. If summation tones are audible,<br/>this is the note you would hear. Let me know if you can hear it.</p><p>&gt;-- so what you will be hearing<br/>&gt; will be a &quot;G&quot; which is 59 cents sharps -- obviously not meshing<br/>with the<br/>&gt; struck &quot;G&quot; an octave below.</p><p>The 3rd partial of the C will be 59 cents off the 2nd partial of the<br/>C in this case. So once again, beating will be the tuner&apos;s guide and<br/>by eliminating the beating between these partials, the tuner can<br/>approach a just 2:3 between the C and the G. The summation tone,<br/>which is in the vicinity of E in this case, will not be of any help<br/>to the tuner, even if he or she somehow manages to hear it.</p><p>I think I see why you said &quot;6th partial&quot; and &quot;12th partial&quot; above.<br/>It&apos;s true that if you have a simple integer ratio *in lowest terms*<br/>p:q, then the lowest common harmonic the notes share is p*q in the<br/>same units, such that the two notes and their lowest common harmonic<br/>form the triad p:q:p*q. This lowest common harmonic (p*q) has been<br/>referred to as a &quot;guide tone&quot; among other things, but it&apos;s completely<br/>different from the summation tone. Moreover, for the example 3.1:2,<br/>the guide tone is *not* 6.2 because 3.1:2 is not a simple integer<br/>ratio in lowest terms. If this ratio qualifies for a &quot;guide tone&quot; at<br/>all, it&apos;s by virtue of its being 31:20 in lowest terms, in which case<br/>the guide tone would be 31*20=620; the chord 20:31:620 containing the<br/>intervals 759 cents between the first two notes and 5945 cents<br/>(almost 5 octaves) between the lowest and highest notes.</p></div><h3>Lorenzo Frizzera &#x3C;lorenzo.frizzera@cdmrovereto.it&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2005 5:14:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Can you make some short example of how virtual pitch works?<br/>I&apos; think I&apos;ve understood the concept but I would like know, for example, if virtual pitch provides a &quot;tonic&quot; for each interval (dyad).</p><p>Lorenzo</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: wallyesterpaulrus<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Monday, February 07, 2005 8:40 PM<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Porcupine-8 tonal theory; sum/difference tones and consonance</p><p>  Yes, they are sometimes audible.
