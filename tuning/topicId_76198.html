During the installation,<br/>it will search your computer, and if you<br/>don&apos;t have .Net 1.1, Tonescape will ask<br/>if you want to install a copy of it from<br/>our website.</p><p>Vista comes packaged with .Net Framework 2.0.<br/>When i installed Tonescape on my own new<br/>machine, i clicked &quot;OK&quot; thru the whole<br/>installation and installed the .Net 1.1<br/>along with the .Net 2.0 that i already had.</p><p>After that, clicking on the Tonescape icon<br/>seemed to launch Tonescape at first, but<br/>then an error dialog opened, and after<br/>closing that, clicking the Tonescape icon<br/>did nothing. This was what i had experienced<br/>before, on OPC (other people&apos;s computers).</p><p>But after having shut down my machine, and<br/>then rebooting later on, i tried Tonescape<br/>again, and voila, it opened up perfectly,<br/>and played the sample .tonescape pieces<br/>perfectly too. And with Vista&apos;s enhanced<br/>graphics, it looks better than ever.</p><p>So, i was afraid before that Tonescape was<br/>really obsolete now because i thought that<br/>it would run only on Windows XP, but now i<br/>can state absolutely that it will run on both<br/>XP and Vista. So for all of you out there<br/>who are running Vista, you can go for it!</p><p>My new project now is to figure out how to<br/>get Tonescape happening under Linux and BSD.</p><p>:)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/tonescape.aspx</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
