Thoughts?</p><p>This may be splitting hairs here, but the theremin really should be<br/>counted as distinct from the computer - it&apos;s an electronic device, but an<br/>analog one, digital technology really has an impact with synthetic timbre,<br/>but by that measure it might be a bit premature to start talking about<br/>computers in intonation yet, since synthetic timbres haven&apos;t really been<br/>used extensively.</p><p>-Bram</p></div>
