If the scale size is N then<br/>there are N! (N factorial) different sequences of all tones.<br/>To calculate the efficiency, for all sequences the shortest<br/>necessary length for key identification is summed and this<br/>is divided by N! and again divided by N to get the relative<br/>length, a number between 0 and 1. So efficiency measures how<br/>many tones help you to identify the key. A low number means<br/>there are many tones that don&apos;t help to do this. It may be<br/>interpreted as a measure of the assymmetry of a scale with<br/>respect to all rotations and translations of itself.<br/>Rothenberg redundancy is defined as one minus the<br/>efficiency. For scales with repeating blocks, like<br/>Messiaen&apos;s modes, it is also defined with the difference<br/>that the identified key will still be ambiguous.</p><p>I think also Winograd&apos;s &quot;deep scale&quot; property would make a<br/>nice entry in the Monzo dictionary. Let me repeat the<br/>definition that John Chalmers gave for it:</p><p>&quot;Winograd called the scales that are generated by cycles of<br/>any interval relatively prime to the octave (or any interval<br/>of equivalence) &quot;Deep Scales&quot; if they have [C/2] or [C/2]+1<br/>tones where C is the cardinality of the Interval of<br/>Equivalence (tones per octave usually) and [C/2] is the<br/>largest integer less than or equal to C/2. Such scales have<br/>interval vectors that contain all the interval classes of<br/>the chromatic set (C) with unique multiplicity (meaning that<br/>an interval like as a major third occurs a unique number of<br/>times compared to the number of times other intervals<br/>appear). The interval vector is a vector whose elements are<br/>the number of times each interval of the chromatic scale (C)<br/>of which the scale is embedded or is a subset, appears.<br/>Conventionally, the intervals are ordered from 1 degree to<br/>[C/2]. For example, the interval vector of the diatonic<br/>scale in 12-tet is [254361]. The interval vector of the<br/>chromatic heptachord (0 1 2 3 4 5 6) is [654321] where the<br/>generator, g, is 1 degree. Two other Deep Scales exist in<br/>12-tET: the chromatic hexachord (0 1 2 3 4 5), whose interval<br/>vector is [543210] and the hexatonic scale (0 2 4 5 7 9)<br/>with interval vector [143250]. Winograd described these<br/>relations originally in a hard to obtain term paper at MIT.<br/>However, Carlton Gamer discussed them at length in &quot;Some<br/>Combinational Resources of Equal-Tempered Systems&quot;, _Journal<br/>of Music Theory_ vol. 11 no. 1, 1967, pp. 32-59.&quot;</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2000 10:15:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &lt;MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@E...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12666">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12666</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [supplement to Carl&apos;s &apos;Rothenberg efficiency&apos;, and Chalmers&apos;s<br/>&gt; [&apos;deep scale&apos; definitions]</p><p>Thanks very much for the additional definitions, Manuel!<br/>Also, thanks to Paul and John deL. for &apos;adaptive&apos; definitions.</p><p>I&apos;m currently having some phone problems, and can only access<br/>the List at the public library, so it may be a day or two before<br/>I can update both the Dictionary and the &apos;JI modulation&apos; webpage.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
