Fuzz Faces naturally tend to bias with only about half a volt on the collector of the first transistor, so there is a lot of room upwards. The input stage will first hit mushy saturation on one polarity of signal and then if driven hard enough, hit cutoff on the other polarity.

Along with the fact that intermodulation distortion will tend to reinforce an otonal chord, it may be that op-amp clipping is more appropriate in some microtonal contexts.</p><p>That said, I still prefer to avoid harsh distortion with chords.</p><p>Mats Oljare said once that intermodulation distortion also works with phi timbres, and tunings based on them.  I did experiment with this (until then I&apos;d been avoiding distortion, thinking it would veer towards harmonic timbres) and it sounded quite good.  Although not good enough to distract me from those &quot;classic&quot; harmonic timbres long enough to record an example, which is why I didn&apos;t mention it before.  And I don&apos;t know if it worked because of the theory, but it did work.

In fact i said that wave shaping produces difference tones,<br/>which isn&apos;t entirely true either. In most cases it will produce a<br/>strong feeling of the fundamental of whatever harmonic series the<br/>intervals happen to be part of. So if the interval played is<br/>5/4,6/5,7/5 or whatever, the &quot;1&quot; of the theoretical harmonic series<br/>(and all the other harmonics of it) will be clearly heard. As for<br/>_non-just intervals though_ , such as 12-tet major and minor thirds,<br/>it is far more complex and probably involves difference tones as well<br/>as the &quot;fundamental note&quot; in some way.</p><p>/Mats &Ouml;ljare</p></div>
