Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oddly enough, Robert&apos;s first table does not include 3/2, even though it&apos;s<br/>&gt; only 7 cents away from 13/22 oct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see what you mean now. There&apos;s something weird about your algorithm,<br/>&gt; especially the &quot;relaxed&quot; version. 10/22 oct. and 12/22 oct. are not good<br/>&gt; approximations of 4:3, 7:5, 10:7, or 3:2. 4:3 is 7 cents off 9/22 oct., 3:2<br/>&gt; is 7 cents off 13/22 oct. and 7:5 and 10:7 are each 17 cents off 11/22 oct.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know why your algorithm assigned these ratios to the wrong scale<br/>&gt; degrees.</p><p>The algorithm is exceedingly dumb. It starts<br/>with calculating the et value (2^10/22 for instance). Then it loops<br/>running the denominator up and seeing if the appropriate numerator for<br/>the denominator improves upon the current error.</p><p>If I relax the error function completely, (for instance, initially you can<br/>be off by 100) then the &quot;3/2&quot; neighborhood in 22 tet looks like</p><p>10      : =1/1  =3/2    =4/3    =7/5    =11/8   =26/19  =37/27<br/>11      : =1/1  =3/2    =4/3    =7/5    =17/12  =24/17  =41/29  =99/70<br/>12      : =1/1  =3/2    =10/7   =13/9   =16/11  =19/13  =35/24  =54/37<br/>13      : =2/1  =3/2    =62/41  =65/43  =68/45  =71/47  =74/49  =77/51</p><p>So this should show clearly how the algorithm works. (Now I have to<br/>go back and find if its producing different results than when this<br/>thread started...)</p><p>As I said, I should refine it with a &quot;most likely to be heard as&quot;<br/>function, using some of the complexity functions that have been<br/>mentioned in the past. The variation from that thread that<br/>I&apos;d use is</p><p>     1) reduce and factor numerator and denominator<br/>     2) sum all odd primes<br/>     3) subtract 1 if denominator is a power of 2</p><p>All that aside, the important thing that came out is the compositional<br/>issue of the importance of context. This shouldn&apos;t be too surprising,<br/>since in 12tet CDE can be 7:8:9 or 8:9:10 or 9:10:11 depending on<br/>the context. But it was interesting to see it in this community<br/>where those three sets would generally strive for uniqueness. Any<br/>et will end up having some punning, and its probably a good thing to<br/>play with. For a sufficiently high et, an opposite sort of punning<br/>may be useful. A context may call for an approximation to a certain<br/>ji but compositionally, a different tempered interval may be<br/>more appropriate.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
