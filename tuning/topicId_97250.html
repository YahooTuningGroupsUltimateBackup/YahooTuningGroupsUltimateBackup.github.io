People who find, by ear, lots of higher limit chords quite acceptable and need a good alternative to navigate through them with.<br/>-----------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second point...why does everyone seem so stuck on using perfect 5ths?&nbsp; Sure, they are the best when you can get them...but what research is being done about using &quot;semi-pure&quot; 5ths like 14/9?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to have a self-fulfilling prophecy here and pointing to perfect 5th based scales and, the more we &quot;succeed&quot; at this...the closer we get back to mean-tone and ultimately 12TET.<br/>------------------</p><p>&nbsp; Also, I&apos;m interested...what do you think of clustered triads (IE triads with end bounds of no greater than 5/4 or so)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&apos;s a huge thrust of what I&apos;m interested in and yet no one seems to be able (or just wanting?) to consider them.&nbsp; Even using Adaptive JI to retune clusters in 12TET...I trust it could make many &quot;used to be wrong&quot; chords sound good enough for musicians to try them and eventually get more interested in microtonal scales with lots of such small intervals...</p><p>&nbsp; How about 18:19:20 (yes, there&apos;s a 10/9 in there) or 18:20:21 (with a 7/6 and a 10/9) or 18:21:22 (with a 7/6 and 11/9)?&nbsp; Or more tame ones like 15:16:18 (with a 9/8 and a 6/5) or 9:10:11 or 10:11:12?&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp; Considering people on this list are so interested in some of the atonal music floating around...I can&apos;t see why it could hurt to, say, work on some tricks to make clustered chords a part of common music theory and not just a way to make &quot;neighboring tones&quot;....</p></div>
