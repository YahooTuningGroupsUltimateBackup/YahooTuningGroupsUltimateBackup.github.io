So there is clearly a bit of an art<br/>&gt; &gt; to this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is one of the most fascinating posts I&apos;ve seen in a long time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would you mind getting a bit deeper on all this on one of the more<br/>&gt; analytical lists, such as harmonic_entropy, tuning, or tuning-math?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d enjoy that, anyway.</p><p>The curves are maybe best explained<br/>with screen shots of them - I&apos;ll<br/>do some to follow this up.</p><p>The basic mathematical idea I used<br/>is to let the user enter any mathematical formula<br/>to set a curve for either the<br/>quarter, half or complete wave.</p><p>If it is intended for a quarter wave, FTS adds a constant<br/>term to ensure that it starts at 0.<br/>Then it does the other three quarters<br/>so that they all join up seamlessly<br/>- continuous lines anyway though they<br/>may not be smooth where the various<br/>quarters meet.</p><p>If it is intended for a half curve, then it<br/>does two rotated copies, so again<br/>they meet up and indeed this time<br/>they will meet up smoothly too if the<br/>original curve is smooth at origin.<br/>This time it adds a linear term to<br/>ensure that the start and end points of the<br/>curve are both 0.</p><p>If it is a complete wave, then FTS<br/>will add a quadratic term to ensure<br/>that the two endpoints of the curve<br/>are both zero, and that in between<br/>it has as much of the curve above<br/>as below the zero line (so that<br/>the areas above and below are equal).<br/>This won&apos;t necessarily always be a smooth<br/>curve where they endpoints meet up<br/>from one wave to the next however.</p><p>It then normalises the result so that<br/>whatever your formula, the maximum<br/>height of the wave remains the same.</p><p>So you can use any formula for any<br/>of those, e.g. you could use say, x^3<br/>for all three and it would still<br/>work and make continuous<br/>repeating sound waves you can play<br/>and listen to.</p><p>You also have a choice of a few<br/>presets too - sine waves,<br/>triangles, a sine triangle, and<br/>repeated sines which make a kind<br/>of a rounded square wave,<br/>and you can morph any of your<br/>curves with a sine wave to<br/>make a curve that is between<br/>the two (e.g. 80 % your curve<br/>and 20 % sine or whatever).</p><p>Then it adds together any desred number<br/>of these waves to make<br/>a harmonic series. The series<br/>can be quantised to the current<br/>scale <a href="http://e.g.to">e.g.to</a> 7-et or 12-et or whatever.</p><p>Then the Setherised thing is a matter<br/>partly of personal preference I think<br/>- maybe the Setherised sine curve harmonic timbres<br/>are in a sense smoother but they also have more obvious beats<br/>(i.e. for each single note on its own)<br/>while more complex curves end up with<br/>a kind of uniform texture or roughness<br/>so that you don&apos;t hear the beats within<br/>that texture so clearly, so it<br/>may sound more harmonious in some sense<br/>if not really smoother.</p><p>The x^n*sin(1/x^n)  etc family of curves<br/>which I tried out is quite interesting here - when you set<br/>n high you get something more like a series<br/>of fast clicks, so a buzz, rather than a<br/>wave, and the more it is like that then<br/>the less you notice any beats, but the<br/>note gets very kind of rough (an interesting<br/>texture and still with a distinctive<br/>pitch in it but a bit more towards a kind of<br/>coloured noise rather than a note).</p><p>Anyway when I have some time after the upload<br/>I&apos;ll do a web page about it with graphics<br/>and sound clips, and some sound fonts<br/>and Gigs to download for users of the<br/>SB soundcards or others that can use<br/>SF2 fonts, and for users of GigaSampler<br/>/ GigaStudio. They consist of just<br/>single waves so are tiny and the new</p><p>FTS has an option to make wave clips<br/>for all the octaves for a sound font in one go.</p><p>However for best pitch accuracy you want<br/>the high pitch waves to be an integral<br/>number of samples. At present it<br/>uses 1/100 of the sample rate<br/>for the 1/1 of the sound font samples as it were,<br/>and then goes up and down in octaves<br/>from that point. So that pitches<br/>them at A = 441, then if you want<br/>A = 440 you can adjust the<br/>result down by 4 cents when you use<br/>the sound font.</p><p>If you try A = 440 at 44.1 Khz<br/>that doesn&apos;t work well. It is important<br/>to get the numbers right there as<br/>the higher notes have very few samples,<br/><a href="http://e.g.at">e.g.at</a> A = 441, then a uses<br/>100 samples for a single wave, a&apos; uses 50, and a&apos;&apos; uses<br/>only 25. Clearly something like<br/>49.5 approximated by 50 there would throw<br/>the pitch well out. Best solution would<br/>be if you could use the lowest pitch wave<br/>for everything but in the SF2 fonts<br/>anyway it seems it won&apos;t let you raise the<br/>pitch more than about an octave or two.<br/>(will be interested to know if anyone<br/>has any tips about this).</p><p>The other solution is to record<br/>a train of e.g. 100 waves<br/>instead of a single wave,<br/>which is an alternative - though the single<br/>wave is more elegant.</p><p>Another idea is to set A=440 and<br/>then save the sound clips at<br/>44 Khz which you can do in FTS<br/>and I think the SF2 format anyway<br/>can handle data in that format,<br/>and play it at the appropriate pitch, will see.</p><p>More later when I do the web page,<br/>and will be interested to know if<br/>anyone has any tips on the sound fonts.<br/>Also has anyone come across any other program<br/>that lets you play any mathematical equation<br/>you like to enter as a sound wave?</p><p>If anyone has any particular questions<br/>be sure to ask too,</p><p>Best,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2004 12:22:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert!</p><p>&gt; (continued from MakeMicroMusic, see end of:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/6700">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/6700</a><br/>&gt; )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW I have added a new option to FTS<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to make any formula you like into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a wave to use e.g. for example<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chords in harmonic timbres<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; - but also they can be made into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sound fonts e.g. for the SB Live! or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for Giga.

Have you looked at the<br/>amplitudes in Fourier transform (i.e., the amplitudes of each of the<br/>partials)? It&apos;s particularly efficient to do when you have a periodic<br/>timbre like this. It also tells you a lot more about the audible<br/>parts of the sound than the shape of the waveform does -- some<br/>totally different waveshapes sound virtually identical since their<br/>partials have the same amplitudes.</p><p>P.S. You don&apos;t really need to add a quadratic term or even a linear<br/>term to get the areas above and below zero to be the same, a constant<br/>would suffice. If you don&apos;t add a linear term, you might end up with<br/>a discontinuous waveform but plenty of waveforms are discontinuous,<br/>for example sawtooth, square, and pulse waves.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2004 3:40:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; while more complex curves end up with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a kind of uniform texture or roughness<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so that you don&apos;t hear the beats within<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that texture so clearly, so it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; may sound more harmonious in some sense<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if not really smoother.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These are periodic curves and thus have harmonic partials,<br/>correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I meant periodic curves of any shape,</p><p>Right . . . periodic curves all have harmonic partials, and no<br/>inharmonic partials.</p><p>&gt; then stacked in a harmonic series</p><p>Whoa!

So you&apos;re stacking &quot;timbres&quot; into &quot;macrotimbres&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;metatimbres&quot; in a sense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, for instance that curve I just showed might<br/>&gt; be the curve used for all the &quot;partial&quot;s in the metatimbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If the answer is yes, I didn&apos;t get this message before, and one<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; certainly expect these &quot;metatimbres&quot; to be very rich in beating --<br/>&gt; &gt; good old, first-order beating between near-coincident partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. I think what happens is that you have so very many in the way<br/>of<br/>&gt; simultaneous beats that they sound more like a kind of a texture,<br/>&gt; depending on the waveform. But they don&apos;t go away completely yet<br/>&gt; with the ones I tried so far apart from the near noise fuzzy buzzy<br/>&gt; timbres I tried. With those, I didn&apos;t pick out any beats, but can<br/>&gt; nevertheless hear all the chord pitches in the noise.</p><p>Cool! I look forward to hearing examples . . .</p><p>&gt; Somewhere between the two with some art one can probably<br/>&gt; get something that sounds smooth and pleasant and hasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; got any beats, and I suppose that is what Setharising is<br/>&gt; all about. I hadn&apos;t appreciated the art involved in it<br/>&gt; before.</p><p>I&apos;m not aware of anyone combining harmonic timbres inharmonically<br/>into &quot;metatimbres&quot; before. It&apos;s certainly not what Sethares has<br/>suggested in his book or articles. So you may be creating a whole new<br/>art form here ;)</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2004 9:28:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also has anyone come across any other program<br/>&gt; that lets you play any mathematical equation<br/>&gt; you like to enter as a sound wave?</p><p>Goldwave has an expression evaluator.

Can you verify this (or help<br/>&gt; me verify it) for the discontinuous waveforms you had in mind?
