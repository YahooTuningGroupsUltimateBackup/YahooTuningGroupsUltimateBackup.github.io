Should anybody here be seriously interested in attempting such a task, I would be more than happy to suggest it to the editors.</p><p>Regarding the temperament article in general, as I take up the torch from Mark Lindley I want to keep the same focus, that is, keep it bound to traditional terminology. In this sense, a temperament by definition is an aberration, a less-than-perfect departure from an idealized situation, a compromise between conflicting requirements. This compromise is required by a deficiency in the instrumentarium, an insufficient number of fixed pitches which must nonetheless be employed to produce, more or less, all desirable harmonic structures. Furthermore, historically the idealized point of departure has always been some form of JI, and as such implies the octave as the interval of repetition. Werckmeister gave a wonderfully succinct definition is his 1698 treatise on continuo playing:</p><p>&quot;Die Temperatur aber hat ihren Uhrsprung daher weil man bey dem Gebrauch des Clavier nicht alle Consonantien wenn man von einem Accord zum andern schreitet rein haben kan so mu&szlig; daher einer Consonantie etwas gegeben einer andern etwas abgenommen werden da&szlig; also ein ertr&auml;gliches und angenehmes temperament daraus enstehet&quot;</p><p>&quot;Temperament has its origin in the fact that when a keyboard is used, it is not possible to have all the consonances pure if one moves from one chord to another. Therefore, a little must be given to the one consonance and a little taken away from the other in such a way that a pleasing temperament is formed.&quot; [my translation]</p><p>Thus, by this definition, neither 11 nor 10 nor 13 EDO nor any XcET system is a temperament, since none of them attempt to approximate any JI distribution (often quite the contrary!), i.e there is absolutely nothing which is intentionally &quot;tempered&quot;. Neither are they &quot;tunings&quot;, unless of course, a la Sethares, they are applied to an inharmonic spectrum which has consonance maximas precisely at certain intervals which are available in the system. In this sense, if any EDO or cET system is consciously adopted precisely in order to approximate an unobtainable JI system for an instrumentarium which has an inharmonic spectrum, then it would be a temperament.</p><p>Up to now, the article has only dealt with temperaments based on 5-limit, and I think at least a mention of expanded JI is appropriate, briefly mentioning that the concept of &quot;temperament&quot; can also exist in larger expanded harmonic universes and is not just a phenomenon of the simplistic confines of traditional 5-limit harmony on traditional dodecdatonic (primarily) keyboard instruments. In fact, one could argue that the larger the JI universe becomes, the more temperament is needed in order to keep the physical process of the production of musical notes from becoming unmanageable due to their sheer number. Additionally, the background assumption has always been harmonic spectra, and I think Sethares&apos; conclusions regarding tuning and tempering in relation to inharmonic spectra should be mentioned, perhaps in a new subsection on the future of temperament.</p><p>Naturally, I&apos;m open to at least consider any and all suggestions.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=96639 href="#96639">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/2011 12:50:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Mar 6, 2011 at 3:26 AM, Paul &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me begin by saying that I would be the first to first to admit that Grove&apos;s sorely needs an article on microtonality or xenharmony or whatever it ought to be called, including all the various terms and concepts which have been developed and are regularly used by folks who frequent this group.

No! That is absolutely not all that temperament is about. The<br/>elimination of comma pumps creates an entirely new musical effect, and<br/>it&apos;s been central to the music we&apos;ve enjoyed for hundreds of years<br/>now. Temperament creates puns, and those are important. And, frankly,<br/>they&apos;re so important that I&apos;d say they&apos;re almost fundamental to our<br/>perception of music</p><p>&gt; Thus, by this definition, neither 11 nor 10 nor 13 EDO nor any XcET system is a temperament, since none of them attempt to approximate any JI distribution (often quite the contrary!), i.e there is absolutely nothing which is intentionally &quot;tempered&quot;.</p><p>11 approximates 4:7:9:11 very well and works well if you think of it<br/>as being in the <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> subgroup. 13-EDO is a father temperament and<br/>hence supports father tempered 5-limit harmony. It can perhaps be<br/>thought of as being in the <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> subgroup.</p><p>&gt; Neither are they &quot;tunings&quot;, unless of course, a la Sethares, they are applied to an inharmonic spectrum which has consonance maximas precisely at certain intervals which are available in the system. In this sense, if any EDO or cET system is consciously adopted precisely in order to approximate an unobtainable JI system for an instrumentarium which has an inharmonic spectrum, then it would be a temperament.</p><p>Every EDO or cET system is consciously adopted precisely in order to<br/>approximate just harmonies, that&apos;s the entire point of regular<br/>mapping. To say that 13-tet doesn&apos;t approximate just harmony is<br/>misleading at best and wrong at worst. Some approximate them better<br/>than others and how much error a composer is willing to tolerate is<br/>best left up to the composer, not written into the Grove dictionary.</p><p>This community is very split on how much error is tolerable. On the<br/>one hand, you have Gene, who prefers microtemperament, and on the<br/>other you have Igs, who uses stuff like 13-tet all the time by finding<br/>what JI subgroups he can within it. To stick in the Grove article some<br/>notion that 13-tet is so far out that it&apos;s not even a temperament is I<br/>think going to sent a lot of people on the wrong track.</p><p>There are those who claim that 12-equal doesn&apos;t approximate 5-limit<br/>harmony because the major third is so sharp - shall we entertain those<br/>as well? Some quick listening tests can confirm that a virtual 1/1<br/>pops out for 0-400 cents as though it were a 5/4, and likewise with<br/>the sharp 3/2&apos;s of 13-equal.</p><p>Frankly, the issue of mistuning tolerance is one of psychoacoustics<br/>and not really relevant. We already have the regular mapping paradigm<br/>as a way to manipulate temperaments in the abstract sense without<br/>having to deal with it, and that&apos;s the angle I think we should work.</p><p>&gt; Up to now, the article has only dealt with temperaments based on 5-limit, and I think at least a mention of expanded JI is appropriate, briefly mentioning that the concept of &quot;temperament&quot; can also exist in larger expanded harmonic universes and is not just a phenomenon of the simplistic confines of traditional 5-limit harmony on traditional dodecdatonic (primarily) keyboard instruments. In fact, one could argue that the larger the JI universe becomes, the more temperament is needed in order to keep the physical process of the production of musical notes from becoming unmanageable due to their sheer number. Additionally, the background assumption has always been harmonic spectra, and I think Sethares&apos; conclusions regarding tuning and tempering in relation to inharmonic spectra should be mentioned, perhaps in a new subsection on the future of temperament.</p><p>I don&apos;t mind a mention of Sethares&apos; work as long as it&apos;s not framed in<br/>such a way that it sounds like partials beating is all that matters. I<br/>don&apos;t think it does.

Neither are they &quot;tunings&quot;, unless of course, a la Sethares, they are applied to an inharmonic spectrum which has consonance maximas precisely at certain intervals which are available in the system. In this sense, if any EDO or cET system is consciously adopted precisely in order to approximate an unobtainable JI system for an instrumentarium which has an inharmonic spectrum, then it would be a temperament.</p><p>To say that 13-EDO simply &quot;doesn&apos;t approximate 5-limit harmony&quot;<br/>because it supports father temperament is absurd and a disservice to<br/>folks like Igs who are hell bent on making musical use of stuff like<br/>that. Rather, it&apos;s more that it&apos;s just not everyone&apos;s cup of tea,<br/>because the error is so high.

My suggestion is to add a<br/>paragraph on regular mapping.  Something along the lines of</p><p>&quot;Modern efforts have revisited the fundamental question of<br/>temperament.  Such efforts were foreshadowed in the Italian<br/>musica reservata by Nicola Vicentino, who built a microtonal<br/>harpsichord (&quot;archicembalo&quot;) and wrote several pieces of<br/>&quot;enharmonic music&quot;.  But other than passing mention in<br/>notebooks of Huygens and Newton, such inquiry remained<br/>remarkably rare until the late 19th century, when Helmholtz<br/>and Bosanquet independently suggested that better intonation<br/>could be achieved by tempering out the schisma instead of the<br/>syntonic comma, as all canon temperaments until that time had<br/>done.  The latter realized his ideas in a 53-tone harmonium.<br/>By 1952, Norwegian composer Eivind Groven had implemented a<br/>similar system on an electronic organ.  One year earlier,<br/>physicist Adriaan Fokker had completed a 31-tone organ in the<br/>Netherlands.  Fokker realized that while schisma-based systems<br/>enjoyed more accurate intonation they would be incompatible<br/>with common-practice repertoire, which assumes that the<br/>syntonic comma vanishes.  His organ improved intonation while<br/>maintaining this feature.  By the 1970s, musicians in<br/>California and elsewhere, following the work of Wyshnegradsky,<br/>Fokker and others, were building novel instruments to play in<br/>a wide variety of temperaments, some quite foreign to the<br/>Western canon.  By the late 1990s, internet mailing lists<br/>supported international collaboration on temperament theory,<br/>which attempts to explain and generalize the diatonic scale<br/>and other features of common-practice music.  By the mid 2000s,<br/>inexpensive and flexible software synthesizers permitted<br/>widespread experimentation in these radically different<br/>temperament systems.&quot;</p><p>Important caveats: 1.
