First he played a recent performance of him<br/>directing (and playing recorder)  Bach&#xFFFD;s 2nd<br/>Brandenburg Concerto in Werckmeister III tuning (the<br/>twelve unequally-tuned notes create 39 intervals at 6<br/>cents apart each, making for much more brilliance,<br/>clarity of individual lines, and an overall sunny<br/>musical disposition). My ear can&#xFFFD;t measure the exact<br/>cents accuracy of each note, but the overall effect<br/>was one of perfect harmoniousness and intonational<br/>consistency. This tuning also allowed for a<br/>much-improved overall ensemble sound and at the same<br/>time more individuality of the parts. Pacing,<br/>instrumental balance (even of trumpet and recorder!)<br/>And expressiveness In this live recording made this<br/>the single best recording of this work I have ever<br/>heard.</p><p>He also gave me a copy of his Cello Concerto,<br/>Odysseus, featuring Dave Eggar, a microtonal<br/>orchestra, shofar, piano, singers (for the Sirens),<br/>theramin, a towel over the cello, etc.  Odysseus&#xFFFD;s<br/>journey from island to island until he finally lands<br/>in Ithaca is brilliantly portrayed. Each instrument<br/>stays in its own tuning system. For example, the four<br/>clarinets play in quarter-tone, morphed sounds, just<br/>intonation and blues 7th harmonic tunings<br/>respectively. Yet it all comes together as a coherent<br/>musical expression.</p><p>I host a classical music program in Colorado on<br/>KGNU-Boulder, 88.5 FM, and I am thrilled to be able to<br/>offer a world-premiere broadcast of these works (all<br/>of the Bach and part of the cello concerto) on Sunday<br/>morning, May 23, around 9:00 am Mountain Daylight Time<br/>(11 am East Coast, 8 am West Coast). For people who<br/>know Johnny from the microtonal theory chat rooms<br/>etc., here is a chance to really hear what his live<br/>musicians can do.  Most of you can hear it at<br/><a href="http://www.kgnu.org">www.kgnu.org</a> (Obviously, the radio station streams its<br/>signal over the internet). Hope you can join me for<br/>about thirty minutes of alternatively tuned and truly<br/>beautiful music!</p><p>All my best,<br/>Chris Mohr</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
