But I tend to think that intelligent people will<br/>&gt; at least try a new tool if it gives them some additional ability<br/>&gt; they currently lack.</p><p>John, your response is perfectly logical, but to balance the<br/>argument, remember that Brahms (composing c. 1851-1896) refused<br/>to make use of the valved brass instruments that were invented<br/>around the beginning of his career and exploited so effectively<br/>by Wagner and his followers.  (Brahms continued working for<br/>13 more years after Wagner&apos;s death.)</p><p>Of course Brahms was criticized from many quarters for this<br/>reactionary adherence to a past aesthetic, but keep in mind<br/>that one of his reasons for retaining the old valveless horns<br/>was his love for their JI intervals  (documented in<br/>Swafford&apos;s _Brahms: A biography_).</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
