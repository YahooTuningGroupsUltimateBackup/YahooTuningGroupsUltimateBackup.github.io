However, I would be more than<br/>happy to send it to anyone who might be interested - in the form of a file<br/>attachment, via private email.</p><p>ANY n-tET =/&lt; 794:<br/>The following is a curious &apos;mathematical condition&apos; that I believe &apos;allows&apos;<br/>diatonic heptads with five whole steps and two half steps (formed from each<br/>scale degree of a major scale that is derived from the three triads of the<br/>I-IV-V) where W=W, h=h, and W&gt;h (i.e., the five whole steps and two half<br/>steps are always the _same_ &apos;n-specific&apos; _two_ whole numbers) in every<br/>n-tET =/&lt; 101 [Save 1 and 2-tET, where both the whole and the half steps<br/>round to zero, and 8-tET, where both the whole and the half steps round to<br/>one.]... and in a modified, and perhaps somewhat less esthetically<br/>satisfying variation,--every n-tET =/&lt; 794.</p><p>EXTRAPOLATING NUMERICAL RELATIONSHIPS OF THE I-IV-V:<br/>If the familiar diatonic major scale of 12-tET is thought of in terms of<br/>I-IV-V triads (where 1, 3, 5 + 4, 6, 8 + 5, 7, 9 (2) = 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,<br/>5th, 6th, 7th, 8th), it is seen that horizontal major thirds plus<br/>horizontal minor thirds, and vertical fourths plus vertical seconds,<br/>separate the intervallic relationships of this &apos;triad square&apos;:</p><p>1st 3rd 5th</p><p>4th 6th 8th</p><p>5th 7th 9th</p><p>where:</p><p>  1st (+3rd=) 3rd (+b3rd=) 5th<br/>(+4th=)     (+4th=)      (+4th=)<br/>  4th (+3rd=) 6th (+b3rd=) 8th<br/>(+2nd=)     (+2nd=)      (+2nd=)<br/>  5th (+3rd=) 7th (+b3rd=) 2nd<br/>                          [9th]</p><p>THE FIFTH AND THE FOURTH OF THE FIFTH AND THE FOURTH:<br/>If you take the fifth and the fourth of an equal division of the octave<br/>(where &quot;n&quot; is the equal division of the octave, n / 12 * 7 = &quot;F&quot;; the fifth<br/>of n, and n / 12 * 5 = &quot;f&quot;; the fourth of n), and then take the &apos;fifth and<br/>the fourth&apos; of that fifth and the fourth... you could then call the fifth<br/>of the fifth (FF) and the fifth of the fourth (Ff) of &quot;n,&quot; the horizontal<br/>major thirds plus horizontal minor thirds, and likewise the fourth (f) and<br/>the fourth of the fourth (ff) of &quot;n&quot; could be taken as the vertical fourths<br/>plus vertical seconds where:</p><p>       n<br/>     /   \<br/>   F       f<br/>  / \     / \<br/>FF  (fF=Ff)  ff</p><p>and:</p><p>n/12*7=F<br/>n/12*5=f</p><p>F/12*7=FF<br/>F/12*5=fF</p><p>f/12*7=Ff<br/>f/12*5=ff</p><p>Using the example of 12-tET (where n=12) this would be:</p><p>12 / 12 * 7 = 7<br/>12 / 12 * 5 = 5</p><p>7 / 12 * 7 = 4 &amp; 1/12th<br/>7 / 12 * 5 = 2 &amp; 11/12ths</p><p>5 / 12 * 7 = 2 &amp; 11/12ths<br/>5 / 12 * 5 = 2 &amp; 1/12th</p><p>and:</p><p>        12<br/>      /    \<br/>    7        5<br/>   / \      / \<br/>&apos;4&apos;  (&apos;3&apos;=&apos;3&apos;) &apos;2&apos;</p><p>where FF+Ff and f+ff are &apos;4&apos;+&apos;3&apos; and 5+&apos;2&apos;:</p><p>   C (+&apos;4&apos;=)  E  (+&apos;3&apos;=)  G<br/> (+5=)      (+5=)       (+5=)<br/>   F (+&apos;4&apos;=)  A  (+&apos;3&apos;=)  C<br/>(+&apos;2&apos;=)    (+&apos;2&apos;=)     (+&apos;2&apos;=)<br/>   G (+&apos;4&apos;=)  B  (+&apos;3&apos;=)  D</p><p>THE MEAN FIFTH OF 5 AND 7-tET:<br/>Using the arithmetic mean fifth (@ 41/70ths):</p><p>3/5ths + 4/7ths<br/>---------------<br/>       2</p><p>and the arithmetic mean fourth (@ 29/70ths):</p><p>2/5ths + 3/7ths<br/>---------------<br/>       2</p><p>of the whole numbers 5 and 7 (i.e., 5-tET &amp; 7-tET) for the F and f<br/>multiples of n/12, where:</p><p>1 &amp; 5/7ths * 4 &amp; 1/10th = 7 &amp; 1/35th (12/7*4.1=~7.02857)<br/>1 &amp; 5/7ths * 2 &amp; 9/10ths = 4 &amp; 34/35ths (12/7*2.9=~4.97143)</p><p>and:</p><p>7 &amp; 1/35th = F<br/>4 &amp; 34/35ths = f</p><p>would furnish diatonic heptads with five whole steps and two half steps<br/>where W=W and h=h (when the n-Whole steps and the n-half steps are rounded<br/>to, _and taken as_, the nearest integer) on each scale degree of the I-IV-V<br/>(&apos;triad square&apos;) major scale in any n-tET =/&lt; 101.</p><p>xF*xf*12:<br/>To render any n-tET =/&lt; 794 (795-tET would render a W&gt;W where the whole<br/>number whole step 57 exceeds 56 by one and twenty-seven fifty-thirds of a<br/>cent) capable of the above...

Although I&apos;ve yet to find any real super-useful, practical application<br/>for &apos;this&apos;--a persistent &apos;gut feeling&apos; keeps telling me: &quot;Stick with it...<br/>it&apos;s worth it... (etc., etc.)&quot; So I do my best to do as I&apos;m told!</p></div>
