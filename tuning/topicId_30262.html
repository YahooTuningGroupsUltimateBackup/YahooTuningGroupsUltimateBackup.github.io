And perhaps<br/>this is all clear to _you_, Joe, but I&apos;d been unaware of some of these<br/>details of the different ET&apos;s.</p><p>Something else confused the heck out of me: 31-tET is a meantone scale,<br/>but the other two aren&apos;t.  Since, in all three scales, the common<br/>intervals are represented by the same number of secors, how is this<br/>possible?  More specifically, what happens to the &quot;pump&quot; sequence<br/>C-&gt;A-&gt;D-&gt;G-&gt;C, where though I&apos;m not showing accidentals, the implication<br/>is to follow the JI ratios best represented by each scale; thus,<br/>5/6 * 4/3 * 4/3 * 4/3 (* 1/2) = 80/81 .  In one scale, this vanishes,<br/>but in the other two it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>The answer is that the pump&apos;s intervals are:</p><p>5/6  -13 secors (+ 1 octave)<br/>4/3   -6 secors (+ 1 octave)</p><p>Altogether, then the pump sequence traverses -31 secors (-13 -6 -6 -6),<br/>plus some octaves.  In 31-tET, that exactly closes the circle, thus<br/>meantone; in 41-tET and 72-tET one comes up a microtone shy, thus not<br/>meantone.</p><p>(Note that this &quot;pump&quot; sequence wouldn&apos;t fit onto the 21 notes of a<br/>Blackjack subset).</p><p>Pretty kyool!  Thanks for the catalyst, Joe &amp; Paul.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=30263 href="#30263">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2001 6:42:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: John A. deLaubenfels &lt;<a href="mailto:jdl@adaptune.com">jdl@adaptune.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 5:43 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Fun with secors<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph P, I sensed that perhaps you were as confused as I was when Paul<br/>&gt; E recently said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_29874.html#30170">/tuning/topicId_29874.html#30170</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul:]<br/>&gt; &gt;Well, if the analogy is to varieties of meantone, then yes, you have<br/>&gt; &gt;31-tET Blackjack at one extreme, 41-tET Blackjack at another extreme,<br/>&gt; &gt;and 72-tET Blackjack in the middle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve not followed the Blackjack discussions in complete detail, and the<br/>&gt; above drew a blank with me, so I started playing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A Blackjack scale is by definition a chain of 21 notes separated by one<br/>&gt; secor.

That is, minimizing this worst error is<br/>your goal.  Here&apos;s an example:</p><p>         System A      System B<br/>         --------      --------<br/>Error 1      +5.0          -5.5<br/>Error 2      -4.0          +0.2<br/>Error 3      -4.5          -1.3<br/>-------  --------      --------<br/>RMS error    4.52          3.26</p><p>Which system is worse?  In minimax, the -5.5, worse than +5.0, means<br/>that System B is worse than System A.  If, however, we use Root Mean<br/>Square, System A is worse than System B.  My own preference in general<br/>would be for RMS calculation, but it is largely a matter of preference.</p><p>As Paul E has mentioned, minimax calculations are more difficult than<br/>RMS, because the derivatives of the &quot;pain&quot; functions are discontinuous,<br/>so it is not possible to set up a single polynomial to solve for.</p><p>HTH.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=30303 href="#30303">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2001 5:39:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Can you point me to a good link explaining &quot;minimax&quot;?</p><p>Minimax simply means &quot;minimizing the maximum error&quot;.
