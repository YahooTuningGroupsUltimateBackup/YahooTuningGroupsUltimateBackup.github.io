Is it an ET triad required or is a JI &apos;justified&apos;?</p><p>It is an interesting question: just because of the problems with commas,<br/>and the keyboard, do we assume that a major triad is implicitly &apos;just&apos; or<br/>does the composer require a &apos;mistuning&apos; caused by the temperament?</p><p>An interesting question...</p><p>&gt;&gt;Conductors that employ huge vibrato will always camouflage intent.  But<br/>&gt;do<br/>&gt;you think a conductor can have no exact crystal clear concept of where the<br/>&gt;intonation should be?  Doesn&apos;t Boulez know?  Simply because it is<br/>&gt;expressionistly employed, without apparent rhyme or reason to you and<br/>&gt;others,<br/>&gt;it means there isn&apos;t any?  Nope.  I don&apos;t buy that.</p></div>
