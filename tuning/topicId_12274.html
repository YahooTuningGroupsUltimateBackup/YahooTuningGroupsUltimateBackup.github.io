And<br/>&gt;that&apos;s enough to describe what John Coltrane did?</p><p>&gt;Apparently so, because I know a *lot* of musicians<br/>&gt;whose only paleographic understanding of Coltrane&apos;s music<br/>&gt;is that small heap of chord notations.  And yet, they<br/>&gt;can reproduce it as faithfully as their technique<br/>&gt;will allow.</p><p>The point here is the fact that some *living* musicians were around<br/>to hand over the tradition and interpret the notation.  The notation<br/>was not enough to do it by itself.</p><p>I was just reminded AGAIN of the limitations of notation by a piece<br/>for violin and piano of mine which has been in rehearsal.  (This is<br/>in my &quot;alte Stile&quot; using only some quarter tones!)</p><p>There was some misunderstand as to the general character of the<br/>music, even though it had been pretty clearly indicated.</p><p>In my experience, it is RARE that notation communicates the exact<br/>intention of a composer... That&apos;s why it&apos;s so important that<br/>composers attend at least ONE rehearsal.</p><p>It&apos;s nobody&apos;s fault.  It&apos;s just that notation never completely does<br/>the job of delimiting ALL the physical and emotional parameters.  So,<br/>it surely doesn&apos;t surprise me that in complex, and NEW tuning<br/>systems, notation would come up short as well...</p><p>_________ ____ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=12281 href="#12281">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2000 11:38:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Joseph Pehrson]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s nobody&apos;s fault.

The proposed<br/>notation systems to try out on &quot;traditional,  professional musicians&quot;<br/>are:</p><p>1. 72 tET<br/>2. 144 tET<br/>3. 24 tET as a reference from which to alter pitches.<br/>4. Just Intonation Ratios - as altered by cents, away from 12 tET.</p><p>Help me out if I&apos;m missing one here.</p><p>I&apos;m also admittedly shackled to electronic ways of dealing with<br/>tunings, but I think I&apos;d have to put my money on number 4, based upon<br/>my, brief but rewarding experience of working with a professional<br/>cellist back in the mid 90s. She was able to nail the Just pitches<br/>with very brief exposure to them and the notation was traditional<br/>with cents values. I do think and important part of how well it<br/>worked out, was that she had an impeccable ear, and was able to<br/>internalize the pitch set being used, after relating it to the<br/>familiar notation and then playing along with a Justly tuned synth.<br/>It was remarkable to see someone play the small shades of pitch<br/>with &quot;cents&quot; accuracy. One scale I used to use, had two tritones at<br/>24/17 and 17/12, which has only 6 cents between - well, in the middle<br/>range, she could play these two pitches so melodically accurately<br/>that there would be no audible beats to my ears.</p><p>I guess this is my 2 &quot;cents&quot;</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But why don&apos;t we try a new direction where we all write &quot;real&quot;<br/>music<br/>&gt; in different kinds of notation to try out on &quot;traditional,<br/>&gt; professional&quot; musicians...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will discuss the possibility to augment Johnny Reinhard&apos;s AFMM in<br/>&gt; some of these directions.
