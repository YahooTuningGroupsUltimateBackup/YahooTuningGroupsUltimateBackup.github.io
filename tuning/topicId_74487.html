It lets the user choose parameters for an arbitrary 2 or 3 level staff and gives a basic evaluation of its usefulness for microtonal notation. Not up to present standards in terms of programming and interface, but may be useful for those of you interested in the whole idea of complex staves who might want to do something else with them.</p><p>Mac: <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/software/StaffBuilder-OSX.zip">http://www.h-pi.com/software/StaffBuilder-OSX.zip</a><br/>Windows: <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/software/StaffBuilder-WIN.zip">http://www.h-pi.com/software/StaffBuilder-WIN.zip</a></p><p>I just checked the mac version which looks as I remember it.

They need standards.  They<br/>can already choose from at least two pet systems of somebody<br/>else.  What more do they need?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
