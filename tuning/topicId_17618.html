I didn&apos;t<br/>mean to imply in any way that jazz stopped evolving at any<br/>point.  I was referring specifically to the extent of use of<br/>microtonality.</p><p>I know that the biggest criticisms in the reviews of the<br/>&quot;Jazz&quot; PBS series are:  1) the fact that the movie is presented<br/>more-or-less as factual when in reality it is seen mostly thru<br/>Wynton Marsalis&apos;s own perspective, and  2) the way the last<br/>several decades are presented in much more perfunctory fashion<br/>than the earlier periods.</p><p>But what I was saying here is that after the advent of bebop<br/>in the late 1940s, the increasingly sophisticated harmonic<br/>and melodic gestures simultaneously became increasingly<br/>grounded in 12-tET tuning (with glaring exceptions, of course),<br/>whereas from the beginning (c. 1915 or so) until that time,<br/>microtonality played a much larger role.</p><p>One thing I&apos;ve noticed in particular is how Louis Armstrong<br/>(the greatest jazz musician ever? possibly...) made very<br/>extensive use of microtonality in both his playing and singing<br/>in the early days, but as time went on, he conformed more<br/>and more to 12-tET.
