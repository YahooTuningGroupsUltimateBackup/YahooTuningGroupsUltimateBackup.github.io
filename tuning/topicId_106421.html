If you&apos;re interested on one particular notation, I can help you set it up.  The result will still be LilyPond, which works differently to graphical editors, but has an active community behind it.</p><p>MicroABC also does a fair bit if you like ABC.</p><p>Mus2 is a commercial notation editor built around microtonal support.

I use ZynAddSubFX these days.  With LilyPond, I use timidity, because it supports the parts of the MIDI Tuning Standard that give arbitrary pitches, so there&apos;s no need to set up the tables.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div><h3><a id=106427 href="#106427">ðŸ”—</a>gedankenwelt94@...</h3><span>9/2/2014 6:15:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the list, Graham! :)</p><p> So far, Mus2 is may favorite:<br/> I was able to set up an Orwell[9] notation with chroma accidentals on a 7-line staff.<br/> The &quot;Thicken one of every 2 lines&quot; option for staves is pretty useful.<br/> Said option could even be used to mimic a Tripod staff, just assign arbitrary<br/> &quot;dummy notes&quot; to the thin lines, and ignore them. ;)</p><p> LilyPond is probably much more flexible, but I&apos;m mainly looking for a composition<br/> tool where I don&apos;t have to compile everything if I want to know what a part sounds<br/> like after modifying a single note.</p><p> I became interested in MuseScore when I read that it has plugin support.
