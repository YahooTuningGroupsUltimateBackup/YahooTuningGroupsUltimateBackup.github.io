These statements were quite rude and uncalled for.<br/>&gt;This is supposed to be a scholarly forum.  If you have some problems with<br/>&gt;Lucy tuning, perhaps you can address them in a scholarly way, to allow for<br/>&gt;real debate. Principles above personalities.</p><p>&gt;I my myself no nothing of Lucy Tuning, just proper manners.</p><p>and was augmenting it with a bit of &quot;noledge&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=8102 href="#8102">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Apparently, Jon, you didn&apos;t even read the message I was replying to,<br/>which said,</p><p>&gt;Who started this LucyTuning nonsense anyway???</p><p>&gt;Extreme delusions of grandeur.</p><p>&gt;Right.  Someone can behave like a cantankerous old curmudgeon, but phrases<br/>&gt;such as &quot;promoting global harmony&quot; and &quot;having fun with them&quot; will fool<br/>&gt;everyone else into thinking that person is a sort of microtonal cross<br/>&gt;between Mohandas Gandhi and Soupy Sales.</p><p>&gt;Never mind the possibility of maybe actually being grateful that someone<br/>&gt;even mentioned your tuning system, which will never become a standard,<br/>&gt;locally much less globally, for any number of years, because it&apos;s too<br/>damned<br/>&gt;complicated (plus, it&apos;s got a funny name:  how about &quot;EthelTuning&quot;??).</p></div>
