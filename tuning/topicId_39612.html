In your favorite tuning systems, or the ones you most<br/>commonly use, are regular major and minor thirds at or near:</p><p>             (a) 5:4 and 6:5 (386.31/315.64 cents);</p><p>             (b) 400 and 300 cents (as in 12n-EDO);</p><p>             (c) 81:64 and 32:27 (Pythagorean, 407.82/294.13 cents);</p><p>             (c) 14:11 and 13:11 (417.51/289.21 cents);</p><p>             (d) 9:7 and 7:6 (435.08/266.87 cents); or</p><p>             (e) other (e.g. irregular temperament or JI system)?</p><p>QUESTION 2. What sizes for major and minor thirds do you commonly take<br/>as your musical norm -- possibly, but not necessarily, the same as<br/>your answer(s) to Question 1:</p><p>             (a) 5:4 and 6:5 (386.31/315.64 cents);</p><p>             (b) 400 and 300 cents (as in 12n-EDO);</p><p>             (c) 81:64 and 32:27 (Pythagorean, 407.82/294.13 cents);</p><p>             (c) 14:11 and 13:11 (417.51/289.21 cents);</p><p>             (d) 9:7 and 7:6 (435.08/266.87 cents); or</p><p>             (e) other (e.g. irregular temperament or JI system)?</p><p>Part of the fun is that answers could be simple or intricate.</p><p>For example, someone who strongly prefers 1/4-comma meantone and uses<br/>it in mainly in a 16th-century European fashion could answer (a) to<br/>both questions: 5:4 and 6:5 (the first pure, the second slightly<br/>impure) are the regular third sizes in this tuning, and the usual or<br/>&quot;normally preferred&quot; ones stylistically.</p><p>Similarly, somone who prefers 22-EDO as a regular tuning, and uses it<br/>as a temperament with the regular thirds of around 9:7 and 7:6 setting<br/>the musical norm, could answer (d) for both questions.</p><p>However, for example, someone who favors Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic and<br/>tetradic harmony in 22-EDO (approximate 4:5:6:7) is relying in a<br/>consonant tetrad both on the regular near-6:7 minor third (4/22<br/>octave) and on the non-regular thirds near 5:4 and 6:5 (7/22 and 6/22<br/>octave).</p><p>Again, freeform responses, or questions if any of this is unclear, are<br/>warmly invited.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=39620 href="#39620">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/15/2002 2:31:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/15/02 3:03:49 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; QUESTION 1.

They don&apos;t quite make it, but<br/>&gt; the sound is better than ET.</p><p>That means that if you play C, then E, then release C, the E goes up<br/>to the pipe natural frequency!!</p><p>The idea that near-just pipe organ pair can enter lock phase mode to<br/>play in JI is more than interresting! It is downright fascinating.<br/>This means that the organ can not be considered as a fixed tuning<br/>instrument, but, to a certain extend as an adaptative one. So there<br/>could be a pitch drift between a pipe sounding alone and a pipe<br/>sounding at a near just interval. Is it possible to provide an sound<br/>example of this phenomena?</p><p>&gt; Those who seek to have their just intonation 100% perfect<br/>&gt; theoretically, create something unnatural, as it&apos;s not found in<br/>&gt; nature for harmonic-partials aboee the 3rd one.</p><p>The perfection is not measurable, but with enough time to settle (and<br/>enough skill from the performers) a capella ensemble can sign nearly<br/>perfect triads, i.e. as perfect as can be measured (with the crude<br/>means I have at hand), let say within one or two cents, and it<br/>certainly not sound unnatural.<br/>I suspect that reed wind ensemble can do even better that.</p><p>&gt; And an organ stop book I had listed many uncertainties organ pipes<br/>are<br/>&gt; subject to which prevents their harmonic spectrum from bein<br/>perfectly<br/>&gt; in tune for any length of time, if at all.</p><p>I have been involved in some harsh &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; discussion<br/>on this NG as an advocate of intrincics limitation of pitch<br/>measurement. Nevertheless,the incertainty on measurement does not<br/>involve AT ALL incertainty on the process under mesurement. I think<br/>that after the air flow settle in the pipes, the tone should be fairly<br/>stable, as should be any resonant system. What make you think that the<br/>tone of many pipes singning together is not stable?</p><p>The explanation of why organ tuning systematically deviate from just<br/>has perhaps to do with the &quot;warmth&quot; given by the beat of upper<br/>frequencie that gives a vibrato-like quality that make them more like<br/>human voice.</p><p>I am not sure if your acceptance of the term &quot;in phase&quot; is in phase<br/>:-) with the common (physical) acceptance of the term, so I am not<br/>sure to understand what your are talking about. Let say that we have N<br/>sources providing pure sine:</p><p>    S1 = A * sin (( omega * t ) + PHI1)<br/>    S2 = A * sin (( omega * t ) + PHI2)<br/>&#x9;.....<br/>    SN = A * sin (( omega * t ) + PHIN)</p><p>They are in phase if PHI1 = PHI2 ....= PHIN. If all sources are<br/>in phase the overall amplitude goes as N while if the phases are<br/>random, the overall amplitude goes (statistically) as square root of<br/>N. So, as you stated, if many pipes in unison are in phase, yes they<br/>sound louder.</p><p>It worth to be noted that the notion of &quot;being in phase&quot; makes sense<br/>only if the sources separation is much smaller than the wavelenth. So<br/>this may makes sense for organ pipes that are near to each other (as<br/>your organ building/tuning hand-on experience demonstrates).<br/>This does not make sense for violins in an orchestra because their<br/>distance to each other is of the order of magnitude of wavelength or<br/>bigger. Further any violin is so much different from any other violin<br/>in term of tone and phase, that even if they where stacked, there<br/>would probably be no such thing as significant acoustical coupling.<br/>The warmth of string ensemble is due to the clustering of instrument<br/>with slighlty different tones and slighly different pitch due to<br/>different vibrato speed, width and phase.</p><p>I think that your understanding of &quot;phase&quot; is much broader than the<br/>physics acceptance and include pitch and tone. Am I correct?</p><p>In fact when talking about &quot;physical&quot; phase, the human ear is<br/>(nearly) totally insensitive to phase on stable signal. Phase is<br/>percepually important in the attack an decay of sound, but not on<br/>stable part.</p><p>When there are multiple similar sources, we may be sensitives to some<br/>effects of the phase, but not to the phase by itself.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3><a id=39751 href="#39751">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/18/2002 8:58:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/17/02 11:16:26 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; but recently I was *shocked* to find<br/>&gt; that the organ has virtually *no* possibility for crescendo and<br/>&gt; diminuendo other than *adding overtones* by bigger mixes in the<br/>&gt; stops!</p><p>The crescendo pedal adds whole stops, not just their overtones.

He said, yes, but<br/>&gt; only on *that* particular rank... and even that was not so<br/>effective.</p><p>First, let&apos;s get the terminology straight.  A &quot;rank&quot; is a set of<br/>pipes (one assigned to each key of one of the &quot;manuals&quot; or keyboards)<br/>having a single timbre; each rank generally has its own on/off<br/>controller, called a &quot;stop.&quot;  A &quot;division&quot; (e.g., swell, great, and<br/>pedal divisions) consists of one or (usually) more ranks of pipes<br/>placed on a wind chest and assigned to be controlled (or played) from<br/>a specific manual (having the same name as the division) or the<br/>pedals.</p><p>The swell division gets its name from the fact that its pipes are in<br/>an enclosure have a set of shutters (something on the order of<br/>vertical blinds) in front that are controlled by a &quot;swell pedal&quot; to<br/>reduce the volume of sound by partial or complete closing.  Most<br/>organs built in the 20th century also have the great, pedal, and<br/>additional divisions similarly enclosed separately from the swell<br/>division and operated by a second expression pedal.  There is also<br/>usually a &quot;crescendo pedal&quot; that can control the volume of all of the<br/>divisions simultaneously by adding stops one at a time in a fixed<br/>order.</p><p>However, this is not the whole story.  What I have described above is<br/>characteristic of a &quot;romantic organ&quot;, one designed and built<br/>primarily for the requirements of 19th-century organ music.  More<br/>suitable for the works of J. S. Bach and earlier composers is the<br/>classic-voiced organ which, in addition to lacking any sort of swell-<br/>box with shutters, has the pipes voiced so that the tone has a more<br/>abrupt (almost percussive) attack (or &quot;chiff&quot;), which makes the<br/>attack of the romantic organ sound mushy by comparison.</p><p>The classic and romantic organs therefore have distinctly different<br/>sounds, so you would almost have to consider them different<br/>instruments, as different as, say, an acoustic and an electric guitar.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39753 href="#39753">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>10/18/2002 10:15:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 10/18/02 11:46:40 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; The classic and romantic organs therefore have distinctly different<br/>&gt; sounds, so you would almost have to consider them different<br/>&gt; instruments, as different as, say, an acoustic and an electric guitar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks, George.
