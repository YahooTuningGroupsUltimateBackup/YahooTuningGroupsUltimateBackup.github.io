Carey was a student of John Clough in Buffalo.</p><p>&gt;Carey, Norman, A. &quot;Distribution Modulo 1 and Musical Scales&quot;</p><p>Hi John, looks very relevant.</p><p>I&apos;ve just found this paper in the Huygens bibliography by<br/>looking up your Carey ref there:</p><p>Carey, Norman and David Clampitt. &quot;Self Similar Pitch Structures, Their Duals, and Rhythmic Analogs&quot;,<br/>    Perspectives of New Music vol. 34 no. 2, summer 1996, pp. 62-87.</p><p><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/pnm/CLAMPITT.pdf">http://depts.washington.edu/pnm/CLAMPITT.pdf</a></p><p>(ref in Huygens bib. <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/bib.html#C">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/bib.html#C</a>)</p><p>He proves that if a scale has Myhill&apos;s property, then it has an interval class d such that<br/>one of the specific intervals of generic size d has only one instance in the scale.</p><p>From this result he can conclude that the scale will be well formed, and the other specific<br/>interval of generic size d will be the generator of the scale.</p><p>Also, if the number of steps of the smaller of the two steps that make up the scale is g,<br/>and N is the number of notes in the scale, he shows that (g,N)=1, (i.e. that they are co-prime)<br/>and that d is the multiplicative inverse of g modulo N, i.e. d*g==1 (mod N).</p><p>He also shows that if you replace g by (N-g) = number of the larger of the two step sizes,<br/>then you get d&apos; = multiplicative inverse of (N-g) mod N, as another generic size which has<br/>one specific interval with only one instance.</p><p>Then once more, the other specific interval for this class has N-1 instances, which gives the<br/>other generator.</p><p>E.g. for diatonic scale, N=7, g=2, N-g=5, and so d=4 (4*2=8==1(mod 7))) and d&apos; = 3 (3*5=15 == 1 (mod 7))</p><p>d=4 gives the fifth = generator of diatonic scale, or the diminished fifth = specific interval with only one<br/>instance for this d.</p><p>d&apos;=3 gives the fourth, and the augmented fourth.</p><p>Another relevant result he shows in the course of the proof:</p><p>In case of the Myhill scales, he shows that in each interval class the two specific sizes of interval d<br/>must be obtained from each other by replacing one L by an S or vice versa.</p><p>This is easy to see, because as you go through all possible locations for the generic interval, there<br/>must be a first scale degree where it changes from one of the specific interval sizes to the next.<br/>The two intervals then overlap apart from two steps, one in the previous one only, and one in the<br/>next one only. Since the intervals differ in specific size, the two steps in question can&apos;t be the same<br/>size, so one is an L and one is an S.</p><p>Ex., :<br/>L L - S L L - L S<br/>L L S - L L L - S</p><p>The L L is the overlap between perfect fourth, and the next one, which is an augmented fourth<br/>The two intervals differ by the preceding S of the perfect fourth, and the following L of the<br/>augmented fourth.</p><p>Relevance to Tryhill results:</p><p>Consider the scale<br/>wilson_17.scl<br/>L  M  S L M S M L S M L M S M L S M<br/>which we know is Tryhill.</p><p>Take for example, the interval class 5<br/>First interval is<br/>L M S L M<br/>i.e.<br/>LLMMS</p><p>How can we get three interval sizes?</p><p>As the generic interval is moved upwards in the scale one degree at a time, the number of<br/>component steps can only change by replacing one step by another of another size<br/>each time, then once you&apos;ve gone round the circle of the scale, you have to get back to<br/>where you started.</p><p>So it could change using the rule</p><p>L -&gt; M -&gt; S</p><p>or alternatively, using<br/>L -&gt; M, L -&gt; M, M -&gt; L, M -&gt;L<br/>i.e.<br/>L L -&gt; M L -&gt; M M -&gt; L M -&gt; L L</p><p>(Or equivalent version with S instead of M)</p><p>However the only way the second one will work, if it can be done at all, is if you have the S<br/>steps spaced out equally in the scale.</p><p>For instance, if the second rule worked for interval class 5, the Ss would have to be exactly<br/>five steps apart.</p><p>S L L M M - S M M L L<br/>to<br/>S - L L M M S - M M L L<br/>to<br/>S L - L M M S M - M L L<br/>to<br/>S L L - M M S M M - L L<br/>would work for instance, at least for intervals of class 5 (haven&apos;t tried to make the example scale Tryhill for the other generic interval sizes).</p><p>But then you have to have an S every four steps all the way round,<br/>which only works if number of notes in the scale is a multiple of 5. (Otherwise, you end up making<br/>all the steps of size S)</p><p>Similar argument applies for all the step sizes.</p><p>So if the scale happens to have a prime number of notes, we can rule out the second type<br/>of change for all the interval classes, and the only possibility is<br/>L -&gt; M -&gt; S</p><p>In particular, this will apply to the Wilson 17 tone scale.</p><p>So for instance, for class five,<br/>L  M  S L M S M L S M L M S M L S M</p><p>the specific interval sizes are</p><p>LLMMS LMMSS and LMMMS<br/>related by<br/>LLMMS (L -&gt; M) LMMSS (M -&gt;S) LMMMS (S -&gt; L) back to LLMMS</p><p>We have just shown that all the specific interval sizes have to be obtained<br/>by this same pattern of substitutions for L, M and S.</p><p>Note that this is for _any_ Tryhill scale with a prime number of notes.</p><p>Now note that if you change M to L everywhere, all these examples of three specific interval<br/>sizes will change to two specific interval sizes.</p><p>So, we can apply the Myhill property theorem. Change the relative sizes of the Ls and<br/>Ms until both are the same size, and you have a scale of two step sizes, and two specific<br/>intervals for each generic interval size</p><p>L L S L L S L L S L L L S L L S L</p><p>So it will have two generators. There are five Ss. So the generator will be<br/>of size d where d*5==1 (mod 17), i.e. d = 7.<br/>The other generator will be at n*12==1 (mod 17), i.e. d&apos;=10</p><p>When you replace M by S<br/>L S S L S S S L S S L S S S L S S<br/>then there are 5 Ls, so the generators again are at d=7 and d&apos;=10</p><p>When you replace S by L (the last possibility)<br/> L M L L M L M L L M L L M L M L L M<br/>then you have 7 Ms, so the generators are at d*7==1 (mod 17), i.e. d=5<br/>or d&apos;*10==1 (mod 17), i.e. d&apos;==12</p><p>All of these have only one specific interval in one of the classes.</p><p>So we predict that the Wilson scale will have only one specific interval size for the<br/>following classes:</p><p>for M-&gt; L and M -&gt; S<br/>class 7 : two cases<br/>class 10 : two cases</p><p>For S -&gt; L<br/>class 5: one case<br/>class 12: one case</p><p>Referring to the SCALA results for this scale, (see post:)<br/>we find:</p><p>Interval class, Number of incidences, Size:<br/>  5:  8  6/5               315.641 cents  minor third<br/>  5:  1  8192/6561         384.360 cents  Pythagorean diminished fourth<br/>  5:  8  5/4               386.314 cents  major</p><p>  7:  1  6561/5120         429.326 cents<br/>  7: 15  4/3               498.045 cents  perfect fourth<br/>  7:  1  10935/8192        499.999 cents  fourth + schisma, 5-limit approximation to ET fourth</p><p> 10:  1  16384/10935       700.001 cents  fifth - schisma, 5-limit approximation to ET fifth<br/> 10: 15  3/2               701.955 cents  perfect fifth<br/> 10:  1  10240/6561        770.674 cents</p><p> 12:  8  8/5               813.686 cents  minor sixth<br/> 12:  1  6561/4096         815.640 cents  Pythagorean augmented fifth<br/> 12:  8  5/3               884.359 cents  major sixth, BP sixth</p><p>as predicted.</p><p>You can also see the two generators that were used to make the scale in these results.</p><p>The eight instances of 5/4 and 6/5 are there because the scale was constructed by alternating<br/>the generators 5/4 and 6/5.</p><p>We see that it also has 15 3/2s. That isn&apos;t surprising since each 5/4 + 6/5 contributes a 3/2,<br/>and so does each 6/5 + 5/4.</p><p>So any scale of 2n+1 notes constructed using n applications of two generators that turns out<br/>to be Tryhill will follow a similar pattern.</p><p>It will have two interval classes that have (n, n, 1) (in some order) as the numbers of instances<br/>of the three specific intervals.</p><p>It will also have two interval classes with specific intervals (1, 1, 2n-1)</p><p>However what about an arbitrary Tryhill scale with a prime number of notes.</p><p>Many scales with a prime number of notes do follow this pattern.
