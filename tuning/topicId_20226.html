As<br/>you probably know, it has 2 sizes of whole step, so we get a comma to<br/>deal with, which makes chords extra hard...you always gotta be wondering<br/>which interval fits which chord. Also, 34 has 2 circles of 5ths...sort<br/>of reminds me of a moebius strip. Whereas regular guitaristic fingerings<br/>and shapes move well from 12 to 19 to 31, they don&apos;t lie so well in 34.<br/>It is a marvelous tuning, however...my next CD will feature at least 2<br/>screaming 34 tone rock pieces...they&apos;re almost done. I am using the 31,<br/>as I mentioned, in the play, and the music being composed is really<br/>making me learn the neck...it&apos;s nice to get paid to learn a microtonal<br/>tuning...I could get used to that...thanks...Hstick  PS...you&apos;re<br/>right...just moving one fret away from various intervals in 31 gives you<br/>a nice, deviant sound...makes it easy to remember, too...there&apos;s a lot<br/>of exploring to do...</p></div>
