As for Pythagoreanism, I<br/>would define any tuning system by fifths (and/or fourths) and octaves as<br/>basically pythagorean in the absence of any data on tempering or<br/>tweaking to get better consonances. There is reason to believe that<br/>Pythagoras learned of tuning by fifths from either the Babylonians or<br/>Egyptians, both of whom had been in close cultural contact with the<br/>Greeks for centuries. I suspect his only contribution to tuning lore was<br/>the use of numbers to describe intervals as the inverse relation between<br/>string lengths and pitch was surely known already.</p><p>As Babylonian arithmetic was highly developed, it is possible that using<br/>numbers to indicate intervals may have been known already, though there<br/>is no direct evidence for this</p><p>Taken literally, the Babylonians seemed to check their tuning by<br/>listening to the thirds or sixths. I don&apos;t find it unbelievable that<br/>they considered the pythagorean intervals to the be the norm rather than<br/>the 5-limit ones we might prefer.
