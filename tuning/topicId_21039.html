I started the show on 31<br/>eq, but switched to 34 because of ease of playability of the axe...and,<br/>I&apos;ve had some interesting realizations and ideas. First, although I&apos;ve<br/>been playing microtonally for about 12 years, I&apos;ve never had a<br/>microtonal guitar in my hands for as much time as I have had during<br/>rehearsals (10-12 hour days for a month), and now 7 shows a week. At<br/>first, it was very disorienting...especially since the music covers a<br/>wide range of styles, from Delta blues to modern free bop, with a bit of<br/>Bach as well. Thus, I&apos;ve had to adapt the 34 system to concepts that I<br/>might not have ever done otherwise. And, the fascinating thing is how<br/>good this tuning sounds/plays in all of these musical genres.<br/>Occasionally, I&apos;m playing along with a pre recorded track (keys, bass,<br/>drums), and the 34 system adapts quite well...and, when I&apos;m playing<br/>solo, the freedom is amazing, to pick and choose from so many note<br/>options...yet, the effect is quite cohesive, I feel. Another interesting<br/>realization...when I played a 12 tone guitar, after a month of not<br/>touching one, it felt coarse and very limited...I missed all the extra<br/>notes...it didn&apos;t feel the same as it once did.<br/>    Which got me to thinking...it might be easy to say that 34 (or 31)<br/>would be ideal for a 12 eq substitute...but, I&apos;m not sure if that would<br/>work in all situations. For example, trying to play a Bach fugue would<br/>be mighty complicated, because of all the possibilities. Possible, to be<br/>sure, but maybe 12 or 19 would be better choices for heavily chordal<br/>music, with a lot of notes to play. The frets are mighty teensy, and if<br/>applied to keyboard, it would be very disorienting as well. I tend to<br/>think, now, that learning a number of tunings for different situations<br/>would be ideal...not a new idea, for sure, but one that makes a lot of<br/>sense to me after the experience of this play.<br/>    Which, BTW, has some very intelligent discussion of microtones in<br/>it...and, the guitarist in the show builds a 31 tone guitar to get the<br/>notes he&apos;s been hearing (and plays fretless at the end as well). Many<br/>people, who would normally never be exposed to these concepts, are<br/>seeing/hearing them because of this play..for a look at a review, go to<br/><a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com">www.rockymountainnews.com</a> for April 13. It is a great gig, and it&apos;s nice<br/>to be getting to really work with such a system as 34...and actually get<br/>paid for being whacked...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=21040 href="#21040">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2001 4:11:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a great gig, and it&apos;s nice<br/>&gt; to be getting to really work with such a system as 34...and actually get<br/>&gt; paid for being whacked...Hstick</p><p>Neil? Out here on the East Coast, getting whacked means something a<br/>little different. It&apos;s a mob term for getting assassinated.
