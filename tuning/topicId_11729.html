Some easy, hopefully, examples might help...</p><p>N is an input, not an output.</p><p>Let me know if this makes sense now.</p><p>Anyway, Manuel just sent me all the harmonic entropy curves in the first<br/>octave from N=80 up to N=405, using s=1% and s=1.2% (thanks, Manuel!). For<br/>the s=1% case, the N=80 curve shows local minima at 264, 316, 386, 438, 498,<br/>582, 622, 702, 814, 884, 970, 1020, and 1052 (7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 9:7, 4:3, 7:5,<br/>10:7, 3:2, 8:5, 5:3, 7:4, 9:5, and 11:6), while the N=405 curve shows local<br/>minima at 276, 320, 388, 500, 589, 634, 822, 886, 702, and 972 (7:6, 6:5,<br/>5:4, 9:7, 4:3, 7:5, 10:7, 3:2, 8:5, 5:3, and 7:4). A look at the curves<br/>gives you a better sense of what&apos;s going on. I uploaded a graph that<br/>includes all of them to<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/manuel.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/manuel.jpg</a> -- the lowest curve<br/>is N=80, and the highest is N=405. They have basically the same shape,<br/>sloping downward overall, but the N=405 curve has considerably shallower<br/>dips than the N=80 curve. Because of the slope, some of the dips, though<br/>visible, don&apos;t turn up as local minima at all in their shallower form (9:5<br/>falls into this category), and (again because of the slope) for all the<br/>dips, a point noticeably to the right of the center of the dip turns up as<br/>the local minimum when the dips are in their shallower form (hence the<br/>slight &quot;stretching&quot; of the cents vales for the N=400 minima -- even the<br/>shallower dips for N=80, such as 10:7, show this right-shifted effect).</p><p>One valuable goal would be to use a series other than the Farey series in<br/>order to decrease this overall downward slope, and hence the right-shifting<br/>and skipping of some shallow dips when looking only at local minima. I&apos;ve<br/>proposed a numerator times denominator limit for other reasons, and it would<br/>help in this area as well. Unfortunately, it&apos;s harder to compute such a<br/>series compared with computing a Farey series, but perhaps between Manuel<br/>and myself we can tackle this.</p><p>The shallowing of the dips as N increases is not something I anticipated in<br/>my original posts, which you&apos;ve read. I would now conjecture that as N<br/>approaches infinity, the depth of the dips approaches zero. This means that<br/>for harmonic entropy to yield something useful, we need to set a value for<br/>N. This unfortunately means the harmonic entropy function has two free<br/>parameters, N and s (not to mention the choice of whether N defines a limit<br/>according to a Farey series or some other kind of series). Choosing an N<br/>means, how high up the harmonic series could we recognize intervals if we<br/>had perfect hearing resolution? That&apos;s a very difficult question to settle<br/>experimentally, since we don&apos;t have perfect hearing resolution. Given a<br/>realistic estimate of the hearing resolution, such as 1%, the fact that the<br/>curves for N=80 and N=405 are so qualitatively similar that is seems highly<br/>unlikely that any psychological experiment could determine which curve is<br/>closer to the truth and which N is closer to the &quot;true&quot; N.</p><p>Although the arbitrary parameters are ugly, what is nice is that, for a<br/>given s, the dips in the curve are pretty much the same for such a wide<br/>range of N values. For s=1%, you pretty much see dips for all ratios with a<br/>denominator (i.e., smaller number) no more than 6, maybe 7, but certainly<br/>not 8 or more. That&apos;s a pretty powerful result. It&apos;s saying, no matter how<br/>high up the harmonic series our brain might be able to recognize<br/>conceptually, a hearing resolution of 1% limits the set of &quot;special&quot; ratios<br/>to those whose smaller number is less than 8 (where special means something<br/>like &quot;easier to recognize than its immediate neighbors&quot;). Now certain ideal<br/>listeners have shown s=0.6% in ideal registers, and having rich timbres and<br/>more than two notes at a time might effectively further decrease s, but<br/>whatever s is, we can find an inherent limit to the complexity of the<br/>intervals that could be recognized as &quot;special&quot;.</p><p>As a denominator limit like this implies an odd limit if you require all the<br/>octave inversions and extensions of a consonant interval to be &quot;special&quot; in<br/>this sense, this kind of calculation could determine how far the odd limit<br/>concept can realistically be taken. I believe that in the context of otonal<br/>chords, Partch&apos;s extension of the odd limit from 5 (or 9, as Partch says) to<br/>11 is not unrealistic; however, for utonal chords, the dyadic harmonic<br/>entropy probably says it all, so the denominator limit of 7 found above<br/>might be the farthest one can realistically go if one expects most listeners<br/>to be able to &quot;follow along&quot;. . . .</p></div><h3><a id=11735 href="#11735">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2000 1:20:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
