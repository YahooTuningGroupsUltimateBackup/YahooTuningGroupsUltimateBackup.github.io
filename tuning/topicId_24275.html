Hopefully, like an overly<br/>loud and obnoxious Hawaiian shirt on a favorite crazy uncle, this can<br/>be overlooked, and the person in the shirt can still be appreciated.</p><p>When possible, I&apos;ll dress appropriately. At all times (even when I<br/>get lost) I&apos;ll value your posts for their civility and sharing nature.</p><p>[Am I correct in assuming that I&apos;m unlikely to bump into you at a<br/>monster truck rally? :) ]</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
