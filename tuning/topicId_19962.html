There are several<br/>different positions regarding the aesthetics of drift in the context of<br/>historically appropriate intonation.</p><p>Re a theory for Binchois:  15 years ago, I had the opportunity to lead an all<br/>-boys trio in music of Binchois and Palestrina.  We did it in just<br/>intonation, at a time when no one could verify the tuning accuracy.</p><p>When the fellows sang it right (and they used to get so nervous, being of<br/>high school age) there was a drift that we would notice because the bass<br/>would be starting the verse a &quot;bit&quot; lower each time we did a stanza.  There<br/>were many.  This meant that we had to choose the correct tessitura with this<br/>phenomenon in mind, in order to anticipate the drift.</p><p>At Wagner College in Staten Island, our trio - the Camp Rising Sun Trio (made<br/>up of former campers of mine) won first prize in a New York megalopolis high<br/>school ages.  I remember it was long program...and we won first prize.</p><p>No one was concerned about drift and no one noticed it.  The chairman of the<br/>music department, following the award reception, refused to listen to any<br/>explanations I offered as to why they like what we did so much.  Tisk task.<br/>It was just beautiful, and that was it.</p><p>Now, would a room of more trained individuals have noticed, or one with<br/>perfect pitch?  Who cares?   When I do the Microtona Bach show, there are<br/>always the unfortunates who call in to the show that I am wrong about what<br/>key is being heard.  They are unaware of the 20th century&apos;s early music<br/>convention of A=415.  These poor individuals can&apos;t get past the lower pitch<br/>frequency in order to hear the intervalic specialness of the different keys,<br/>which I point out to the greater majority of listeners.</p><p>My point on Benedetti is he is a single individual possibly pointing out an<br/>alternative to drift, but in no way indicating that it wasn&apos;t widely<br/>accepted.  Now from my perspective, I find it more interesting and I find<br/>that it is built in to the compositions by the works I have explored through<br/>performance.</p><p>Gesualdo, well, I have performed him in extended meantone.  It seems quite<br/>coincidental that I will be opening for a Gesualdo ensemble in London on<br/>March 22nd.  I sure hope to discuss intonation with them.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
