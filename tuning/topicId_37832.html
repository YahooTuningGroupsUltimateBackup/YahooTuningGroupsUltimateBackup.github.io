I will grant grant that<br/>his statements that the Tone is the difference between Fifth and the<br/>Fourth and that the Fourth is equal to 2 and 1/2 such tone formally<br/>describe 12-fold divisions of the octave according to our contemporary<br/>understanding. However, I don&apos;t think that he ever intended to divide<br/>the octave into 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 or 144 equal steps, the latter<br/>division being necessary to include the hemiolic chromatic genus (3/8 +<br/>3/8 + 7/4 tones) and a couple of genera rejected as unmelodic in one<br/>temperament.</p><p>In the first place, the octave was less important to Aristoxenos than<br/>the the tetrachord, its interior lesser intervals, and the species of<br/>the fifth. Secondly, he spoke only of parts of the Tone and held that<br/>numbers were unnecessary to define tunings as this basic interval and<br/>its subdivisions into fourths, thirds, 3/8&apos;s, and halves could be<br/>determined by the trained ear alone. He also said that the tunings of<br/>the intervals within the tetrachordal framework were potentially<br/>infinite and that he was describing only the best-known varieties. In<br/>this I believe is reason to credit Aristoxenos with being the first<br/>psychoacoustician rather than the inventor of temperament.</p><p>The description of Aristoxenos&apos;s tunings in terms of a fourth divided<br/>into 30 segments is due to a later writer, Cleonides. Granted, this<br/>device does suggest a equal temperament of 72 tones/octave or, to<br/>Kathleen Schlesinger, a tuning based on the divisions of the 9/8 as a<br/>means of approximating the just ratios of her &quot;Harmoniai.&quot; I believe,<br/>however, both interpretations are funamentally wrong.</p><p>Greek mathematicians always used a decimal-coded sexigesimal notation<br/>(base-60) originally derived from the Sumerians via the Babylonians. In<br/>this system, the 2/1 is conveniently written as 120/60 and the harmonic<br/>framework 2/1 3/2 4/3 1/1 thus becomes the series of string lengths 120<br/>90 80 and 60 units. The ratio 120/90 is 4/3 and 120-90 = 30. I believe<br/>this is the source of Cleonides&apos;s 30 parts to the fourth and the main<br/>reason we interpret Aristoxenos&apos;s tunings as equal temperament.</p><p>This mode of writing the string lengths corresponding to the notes of<br/>the various scales was used by Eratosthenes, the director of the Library<br/>at Alexandria and the first to accurately measure the earth&apos;s<br/>circumference, to describe his own tunings, which are numerical<br/>approximations of Aristoxenos&apos;s genera. Eratosthenes, however, made the<br/>fundamental mistake of subtracting Cleonides&apos;s &quot;parts&quot; from those of a<br/>real string of 120 units to define his genera. While this linear<br/>approximation works reasonably well for the enharmonic (120 117 114 90<br/>or 3 + 3 + 24 parts), the soft and hemiolic chromatic genera are<br/>distorted rather badly and higher primes are<br/>introduced into what was probably meant to be a 3, or at most 7, limit<br/>tuning. Ptolemy perpetuated this misunderstanding in his catalog of<br/>historical tunings in the Harmonics and as result Aristoxenos&apos;s tunings<br/>are often misinterpreted by novice xenharmonists.</p><p>The final reason I have for not believing that Aristoxenos invented ET<br/>to describe his tunings is that none of the Greek theorists, many of<br/>whom are quite strict Aristoxenians or who combined his and Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>ideas, ever seem to have computed the string lengths for even 12-tone<br/>ET. Such computations were well within the capabilities of Greek<br/>mathematics; Archytas himself, who introduced 7 limit tunings into Greek<br/>theory, was famed for a 3-dimensional construction for extracting the<br/>cube root of 2, a solution to the Delian problem of the duplication of<br/>the cube. Tables of square and cube roots are known from the Babylonians<br/>and Greek mathematicians were certainly capable of taking the the<br/>required number of square roots of the cube root of two if they thought<br/>doing so was musically significant.</p><p>As a parting shot, let me say that I think that the precision of these<br/>notated tunings is quite illusory given the vocal basis of Greek music<br/>and the mechanical simplicity of Greek instruments. Equal temperament<br/>would have been close enough for contemporary performances in<br/>Aristoxenos&apos;s tunings and probably for the JI-based ones of Archytas,<br/>Didymos, and Ptolemy as well.</p></div><h3><a id=37834 href="#37834">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2002 2:33:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Secondly, he spoke only of parts of the Tone and held that<br/>&gt; numbers were unnecessary to define tunings as this basic interval and<br/>&gt; its subdivisions into fourths, thirds, 3/8&apos;s, and halves could be<br/>&gt; determined by the trained ear alone.</p><p>By &quot;numbers&quot; he presumably meant positive integers and their ratios.<br/>The Greeks were perfectly capable of understanding the idea of dividing an octave (or tetrachord) into equal parts, but would not call that using numbers.</p><p>&gt; Greek mathematicians always used a decimal-coded sexigesimal notation<br/>&gt; (base-60) originally derived from the Sumerians via the Babylonians.</p><p>Hardly always.</p><p>&gt; The final reason I have for not believing that Aristoxenos invented ET<br/>&gt; to describe his tunings is that none of the Greek theorists, many of<br/>&gt; whom are quite strict Aristoxenians or who combined his and Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>&gt; ideas, ever seem to have computed the string lengths for even 12-tone<br/>&gt; ET.</p><p>They probably wouldn&apos;t, and even if they did, they would mostly likely use a geometrical approach to the problem and not Babylonian style tables.
