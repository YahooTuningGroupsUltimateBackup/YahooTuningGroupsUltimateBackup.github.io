I&apos;ll use any excuse to<br/>mention Mahler), but I had wanted to say something about a<br/>paritcular aspect of his work and didn&apos;t, and now Paul Erlich<br/>has given me reason to do so.</p><p>[Paul Erlich, TD 208.6]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have perfect pitch either, but I&apos;m pretty convinced<br/>&gt; that when listening to a piece of music, even a long classical<br/>&gt; one, my mind latches onto the pitch and the key of the opening<br/>&gt; fairly accurately.  Although I&apos;m not fully conscious of it when<br/>&gt; it happens, a return to the home key near the end of a piece<br/>&gt; seems to give a psychological sense of closure that I doubt<br/>&gt; could be achieved by ending a whole-tone away from the original<br/>&gt; key. By the way, the same opinion would probably be expressed<br/>&gt; by most theorists who study classical music (such as Schenkerian<br/>&gt; analysts), and by members of Phish.</p><p>First of all, let me say that I&apos;m happy to find out that such an<br/>erudite microtonal theorist shares my lack of perfect pitch!</p><p>Secondly, in connection with Mahler, much has been made of his<br/>so-called &apos;progressive tonality&apos;: that is, he often begins a<br/>symphony in one key, but concludes its final movement in another,<br/>and the progression of key-centers of the movements as blocks<br/>within his symphonies is often quite bizarre, considering that<br/>Mahler&apos;s style is basically diatonic.</p><p>Three blatant examples are the _5th_, which opens in C#-minor and<br/>ends in D-major (supposedly a progression from &apos;darkness&apos; to<br/>&apos;light&apos;), the _7th_, opening in B-minor and ending in C-major<br/>(same idea as the _5th_), and the _9th_, opening in D-major and<br/>ending in D-flat-major (supposedly portraying Mahler&apos;s resignation<br/>to impending death).</p><p>This all looks good on paper, but I&apos;ve never heard any of it.</p><p>Admittedly, I&apos;ve never done experiments like retuning entire<br/>movements of Mahler symphonies, but I really think this stuff<br/>is rather far-fetched, especially in view of the scale upon<br/>which Mahler constructed his grandiose works.  When one of his<br/>symphonies ends, an hour and 25 minutes after it began, in a<br/>different key, I sure don&apos;t notice it.</p><p>I think I can give creedence to what you say about an unconscious<br/>perception of the logic of returning to the &apos;home key&apos;, but I<br/>also think that the time-scale upon which drift may happen<br/>plays a part in this unconscious recognition.</p><p>Certainly, Schenkerian analysts would agree with what you say,<br/>but I&apos;ve never placed much stock in Schenker&apos;s theories myself.<br/>I think a lot of *it*, too, is far-fetched.</p><p>I&apos;d say both of us need to perform some listening experiements<br/>in connection with this before we make any more statements about<br/>it with any intention of conclusiveness.</p><p>Joseph L.
