Its purpose is to introduce, from my own<br/>perspective, a great software on Turkish Maqam music. Some of you<br/>already know the software in question. It is none other than Mus2okur.<br/>Mus2okur for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista by Data-Soft, available in<br/>Turkish and English languages, is an interactive multimedia encyclopedia<br/>of &quot;traditional&quot; monodic and heterophonic styles of Turkish music<br/>&acirc;Â€&quot; comprising hundreds of &quot;Ottomanish&quot;, if you will, and Folk<br/>pieces.<br/>You can download a demo version of Mus2okur from the link below:<br/><a href="http://www.musiki.org/Mus2okur_en.aspx">http://www.musiki.org/Mus2okur_en.aspx</a><br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.musiki.org/Mus2okur_en.aspx">http://www.musiki.org/Mus2okur_en.aspx</a>&gt;<br/>In my opinion, calling Mus2okur an &quot;encyclopedia&quot; does much injustice to<br/>the actual capabilities of the program. Besides being a storehouse of<br/>scores, lyrics, biographies, theoretical information and demonstrations,<br/>Mus2okur is a sampler, player and instructor in 53-tone equal<br/>temperament.<br/>Allow me to insert a paranthesis here.<br/>You will remember that I and several other musicians in T&Atilde;&frac14;rkiye<br/>classify the Middle Eastern art genre common to many nations and<br/>ethnicities and based on makamlar (roughly, &quot;modes&quot;) &amp; usuller<br/>(indigenous rhythms) as Maqam music. To indicate an Anatolian-Thracian<br/>savour, we say Turkish Maqam music.<br/>Mus2okur adheres to the mainstream expression &quot;Turkish music&quot; though, to<br/>denote the metropolitan maqamish styles known as &quot;Classical Turkish<br/>Music&quot; and &quot;Turkish Art Music&quot;, as well as the rural and<br/>since-a-few-decades-urban &quot;Turkish Folk Music&quot;...<br/>You will notice, that these two sub-denominations (Classical &amp; Art)<br/>signify a 19th Century bifurcation within the tradition: A serious or<br/>&quot;austere&quot; style on the one hand, and a popular or &quot;frisky&quot; style on the<br/>other.<br/>Alternative terms for said bifurcation have also been used in the past:<br/>&quot;Enderun Musikisi&quot; emphasizes the dignified manner of the Ottoman Court<br/>and dergahlar (sufi brotherhoods), while &quot;Fasil Musikisi&quot; emphasizes the<br/>zestful manner of intellectual music gatherings, popular concerts, and<br/>musical entertainment in gazinolar (casinos) &amp; meyhaneler (pubs).<br/>The distinction between Classical and Art is not always so clear-cut<br/>however, as these styles are intertwined through the use of instruments,<br/>forms, maqams and usuls common to both. Only the &quot;Folk&quot; repertoire may<br/>rightfully be considered an altogether seperate stylistic branch while<br/>remaining within the domain of maqam-hood.<br/>Suffice it to say, Classical, Art and Folk styles are three authentic<br/>and autochthonous musical flavours of T&Atilde;&frac14;rkiye, making up in whole<br/>what I prefer to call &quot;Turkish Maqam music&quot;. Mus2okur comprises pieces<br/>from all these styles, with special dedication to Classical &amp; Art<br/>compositions.<br/>While I think it is much more appropriate to use the term Maqam music -<br/>to the detriment of habit - in order to imply all of the above-mentioned<br/>flavours and their Arabic, Persic, Turkic and Hindustani counterparts<br/>(be they Art or Folk), and attach the prefix &quot;Turkish&quot; to localize the<br/>genre to the geography whose epicentre is Anatolia and Thrace, it is<br/>understandable to prefer the simpler and more established shorthand term<br/>&quot;Turkish music&quot; despite its ambiguity, due, among other things, to<br/>quotidian controversies surrounding the proper employment of scholarly<br/>nomenclature.<br/>While I do not agree with the trend to misuse the term &quot;Turkish music&quot;<br/>(which rightfully embodies Pop, Rock, Arabesk and lately Hip-Hop of<br/>T&Atilde;&frac14;rkiye as well), Mus2okur&apos;s target audience is undoubtedly<br/>sensitive to minute changes in prevalent idiom.<br/>Here I close the paranthesis.<br/>The reason for the selection of 53-tone equal temperament for Mus2okur<br/>is quite logical: The Holderian comma resolution not only comprises the<br/>notorious Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek System (which is still the standard model in<br/>conservatories and traditional music circles despite its numerous<br/>shortcomings) with less than a cent absolute error at any degree, it<br/>also embodies two types of middle seconds that satisfactorily explain<br/>characteristic inflexions peculiar to maqams such as Ushshaq, Saba,<br/>H&Atilde;&frac14;zzam and Karjighar that cannot be accounted for, nay, was<br/>vehemently shunned by Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek: 136 cents (2/3 tone) and 158<br/>cents (roughly 3/4 tone).<br/>Listeners will appreciate the fact that subtle microtonal nuances of<br/>53-tone equal temperament have been employed in the playback of all<br/>transcribed pieces in Mus2okur. 53-tET is a quick and elegant solution<br/>to overcome decades-long issues abounding in Turkish Maqam music theory,<br/>at least in a computer program.<br/>Mus2okur remains faithful to the AEU System only in the transcription of<br/>customary key signatures and accidentals as seen in Classical and Art<br/>music scores. Behind the veil, Mus2okur renders the pieces with their<br/>proper microtones. By that, I mean the playback, where appropriate, of<br/>middle seconds that elude the AEU System. In Folk pieces, comma numbers<br/>are revealed above ordinary sharps &amp; flats and executed as truly<br/>intended.<br/>Mus2okur can imitate, through sampled sounds, an actual Classical, Art<br/>or Folk music performance when the appropriate instrument(s), diapason,<br/>tempo and usul beat duration are chosen prior to playing a piece from<br/>the database. While Mus2okur is unbiased to these styles and it is up to<br/>the user to make the necessary calibrations to give the &quot;correct feel&quot;<br/>to the music, you can easily experiment by trusting your ear and<br/>judgement.<br/>As a hint, I can tell you my preference that Folk pieces (T&Atilde;&frac14;rk&Atilde;&frac14;,<br/>Oyunhavasi, etc...) should be rendered with Baglama, Tanbur, and Def<br/>(velveleli), in Davud Nisfiye diapason at a Moderato tempo.<br/>For Classical compositions (Pesrev, Beste, Semai, etc...), choose the<br/>Ud-Tanbur-Kanun-Ney combination, select Bendir (normal) as the rhythmic<br/>instrument, make sure the tempo is Largo and the diapason set as Kiz<br/>neyi.<br/>For popular Art compositions (T&Atilde;&frac14;rk&Atilde;&frac14;, Sarki, Fantezi, etc...),<br/>use the same instrumental combination as above with Darbuka (velveleli)<br/>or Def (velveli) as the rhythmic instrument, and make sure the tempo is<br/>Allegretto and the diapason is set to Bolahenk.<br/>Don&apos;t forget that you ought to pick the rhythmic instrument from under<br/>the Usul tab.<br/>Now try these settings with my personal favourites from the database:<br/>1.

To accompany the piece in real-time<br/>with your voice, click on Accompaniment. Alternatively, you can choose<br/>to recite solfege syllables in Do-Re-Mi format, A-B-C format, or<br/>Ra-Du-Se format (an innovation by M. Kemal Karaosmanoglu). You can<br/>command the program to display syllables as heard in concert pitch or as<br/>written in the score.<br/>Unfortunately, there are some issues with the proper display of Turkish<br/>characters of lyrics in the English version of the software, which the<br/>Data-soft team will hopefully fix in a future update. This won&apos;t hinder<br/>you from enjoying your Mus2okur karaoke sessions though.<br/>Mus2okur&apos;s scores have been meticulously notated - some including<br/>dynamic marks and dynamics playback - by Project Director Mustafa Kemal<br/>Karaosmanoglu using Mus2, a non-commercial composing tool programmed by<br/>Karaosmanoglu himself, which is scheduled to be released for consumers<br/>at a future date.<br/>Mus2okur is regularly updated to include more savoury pieces from<br/>Turkish Maqam music repertoire. Already, it houses over a thousand songs<br/>in its archive complete with notations and lyrics. Navigating within the<br/>song database is easy. You can sort the list by any category (composer,<br/>lyricist, name, code, maqam, usul, etc...) according to your liking.<br/>If you want a trustworthy source beneath your fingertips via which you<br/>can learn Turkish Maqam music interactively, study its tones, genera,<br/>maqams, usuls, ahenks and forms, you must give Mus2okur a try.
