I had conceived that this number makes an arithmetical octave only and thatthe real musical octave could be slightly higher than 2. Such unknown value would permitthe scale development based exclusively on perfect fifths. I also thought that the relativefrequency of note G with respect to C = 1 must be 1,5 since this value is a natural consonance;it was the basic assumption.Starting from C = 1, and since the Pythagorean sequence D, E, F, G ends on 1,5, each toneinterval might be twice than the E/F interval, that is, seven equal semitones from C = 1 to G=1,5.If we call X to each semitone factor, then X(7) = 1,5 where (7) is an exponent.Therefore: 7 log X = log 1,5 = 0,17609125905 and log X =  (0,17609125905 / 7) = 0,02515589415Solving for X, we get X = Semitone Factor = 1,05963402267.The twelve frequencies of the perfect fifths scale follow:C = 1C# = 1,05963402267D = 1,12282426199Eb = 1,18978278946E = 1,26073432331F = 1,3359169825F# = 1,41558300612G = 1,5Ab = 1,58945103401A = 1,68423639297Bb = 1,78467418421B = 1,89110148494Musical Octave = 2,00387547376 --------- (1203,35 CENTS)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE 88 PIANO TONE FREQUENCIES ARE RULED BY A CONSTANT SEMITONE FACTOR 0F 1,05963402267 TO PRODUCE PURE FIFTHS (1.5) WHATEVER THE KEY IS PLAYED.

The paragraphs given below are written by Margo. I appreciate her kind cooperation and next time I will try to discover subjects that were not discovered before.I would like to see that tuning yahoo group pay attention on this intonation for its brilliant and charming chords according to Margo&acute;s information.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------On Fri, 19 Sep 2008, Mario Pizarro wrote:&gt; Even in the case that the scale crowded with pure fifths (1,5) is about the&gt; equal tempered I think that I should give all the data to the tuning list.&gt; Margo, if you are stating that a similar scale has been done in Europe&gt; (When?) and some for example have found the tone qualities brilliant and&gt; charming, why this enchanter scale is hidden in the past? Dear Mario, Please let me quickly give you some references on this style oftemperament where an octave is slightly stretched to create perfectfifths, or in a milder version perfect twelfths. Serge Cordier haspublished on this style of tuning extensively: search that name if youhave access to Google, and you should get some helpful results. One helpful paper is: &lt;<a href="http://arpam.free.fr/hellegouarch.pdf">http://arpam.free.fr/hellegouarch.pdf</a>&gt; Here&apos;s a version of the scale based on a pure 3:2 from the Scala scalearchive:  ! cordier.sclSerge Cordier, piano tuning, 1975 (Piano bien temp&eacute;r&eacute; et justesse orchestrale) 12! 100.27929 200.55857 300.83786 401.11714 501.39643 601.67572 3/2 802.23429 902.51357 1002.79286 1103.07214 1203.35143   I&apos;ll also attach some discussions from Usenet, rec.music.theory, in whichI participated in the year 2004.&gt; Hoping to get your news soon Please let me thank you for your patience; my purpose is to shareinformation so that you may best decide how to post to the Tuning list. &gt; Regards&gt; Mario&gt; Lima, Per&uacute;       Default Recordings using stretched (perfect fifth) tuning on the piano _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________    Anyone know of any available recordings, preferably piano trios,   where the piano was tuned, &agrave; la Cordier, stretched so that every   fifth is a perfect fifth?   just ffoulkes      [23]Reply With Quote    francis muir      #[24]2    Old 12-02-2004, 06:01 PM    francis muir   Guest     Default &quot;The Well-tempered Klavier and Orchestral Justesse&quot; by SergeCordier. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________    On 12/2/04 9:52 AM, in article BDD49651.4AE6%francis.muir.1944@balliol.org,   &quot;francis muir&quot; &lt;francis.muir.1944@...&gt; wrote:   &gt; Anyone know of any available recordings, preferably piano trios,   &gt; where the piano was tuned, &agrave; la Cordier, stretched so that every   &gt; fifth is a perfect fifth?   &gt;   &gt; just ffoulkes   I may be on to something.
