He is associated with Patrick Ozzard-Low,<br/>&gt; who was just posting here again last week after a very long absence.<br/>&gt; You can look up Ozzard-Low in the list archives and on the web, and<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll find some stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Donald is a good friend.  He heard me in Amsterdam and is trying to have my<br/>solo for recorder, &quot;Eye of Newt,&quot; performed.  He writes regularly for<br/>recorder duo in quartertones.  He&apos;s a good man.  But that does not mean that<br/>I need agree to his estimation of what a particular musician can hear.</p><p>This list has oft been criticized for its mathematic bent.  Frankly, I have<br/>always seen it as mistrustful of its musical senses.  Experiential knowledge<br/>of music supersedes book reading of music, from a musician&apos;s point of view.<br/>Much of music has traditionally been labeled ineffable.  Well, we have come a<br/>long way.</p><p>For example I can pick out the exact frequency on my bassoon to match, blend<br/>or overtake whatever is called for.  I can&apos;t tell the list &quot;how&quot; this is<br/>done.  It is just done, repeatedly.  It&apos;s not like claiming to bend a spoon<br/>with my mind like &quot;psychics&quot; have said before.</p><p>Frankly, you guys should have faith.  Faith that the people that move you<br/>musically can do so because of mysteries that they possess.  And I am telling<br/>you all that I hear and perform finer than research has suggested.  Call it<br/>anecdotal evidence.</p><p>I&apos;ll never forget a particular 17-year old singer at a summer camp who could<br/>match my microtonal pitch as I improvised faster and faster, more and more<br/>eclectically.  She&apos;s the best I ever found...no perfect pitch as well.  It&apos;s<br/>a different type of ear, perhaps than the usual, but not so surprising in<br/>lieu of the existence of such things as &quot;perfect pitch&quot; and &quot;synaesthesia.&quot;<br/>Hey, you don&apos;t have to believe me.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
