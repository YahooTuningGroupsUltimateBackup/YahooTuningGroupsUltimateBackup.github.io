(He called it rubbish.) Just know that, although this does<br/>express the gist of my message, it is expresses it in a very crude, even obnoxios<br/>manner because of the context in which is was written. It is an excerpt from the<br/>abstract to my thesis. The abstract was one of the last touches before submitting<br/>the final draft, and it was necessay to distill all the points of the dissertation into X<br/>number of words. The result was a very crude, dry language (even drier than the<br/>thesis itself), intended for little more than archiving purposes in my mind. Although<br/>I knew this document was accessible to the public, what I really intended for<br/>&quot;general consumption,&quot; as I&apos;ve explained here before, was the PNM essay. Even if<br/>one disagrees with my points, one would have to admit that they are not worded in<br/>such an abrasive manner in PNM. (E.g. Where I outline my points in the<br/>introduction, I just state that the &quot;simply adding pitches&quot; approach &quot;has several<br/>advantages over&quot; the &quot;pure tuning&quot; approach. That shouldn&apos;t be as annoying, I&apos;d<br/>think, especially if one recognizes that it is presented as opinion.)</p><p>So, don&apos;t mistake the abstract for the paper itself, and, person-to-person, if you<br/>want to read what I consider the better-written expression of my views, try the<br/>PNM version.</p><p>&gt; &quot;From these points the author derives further that a microtonal<br/>&gt; technique must be based on careful voice-leading in general...&quot;<br/>&gt; Yes ! And I hope more scholarship explores this sort of<br/>&gt; practical matter for the practicing musician.</p><p>I wonder what you&apos;d have to say about Part 2 of my essay (either thesis or PNM)<br/>in which I discuss this at great length. Also, you might like to see Joe Maneri&apos;s and<br/>Scott Van Duyne&apos;s book, &quot;Preliminary Studies in the Virtual Pitch Continuum,&quot;<br/>even though it is not written with pure tuning in mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The paper concludes with speculation about the applicability of<br/>&gt; serial techniques, as well as the inherent atonality of this<br/>&gt; music.&quot;</p><p>&gt; In spite of the term &quot;atonal&quot; being taken for granted almost<br/>&gt; universally, particularly with academia, I have to say that I<br/>&gt; long shared the sentiments in a Monzo post from Jan 2001 (Tuning<br/>&gt; Digest 1029), &quot;Schoenberg very logically argued (as he always<br/>&gt; did) that since the very substance of music was &quot;tone&quot;, then<br/>&gt; &quot;atonal&quot; was an oxymoron and could not describe anything having<br/>&gt; to do with music.&quot; and &quot;...what Schoenberg clearly wanted to do<br/>&gt; was to *expand* tonality&quot;.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly with this. I can&apos;t stand the word, especially since it&apos;s so<br/>misleading, and makes what for some is a &quot;positive&quot; creative state of being seem<br/>negative. But I chose to use it because it seems to be common usage. I did wince<br/>everytime I wrote it.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d also like to add that &quot;non-Western musical traditions&quot; are<br/>&gt; just as (&amp; often times more) closed-minded than *western* ones.<br/>&gt; Microtonality as we here are interested in (I hope), as<br/>&gt; adventurers &amp; explorers, is a universal phenomenon.

Some form of qualification is necessary and I&apos;ve looked through the archives to see what happened when the matter of &quot;limits&quot; came up before. There&apos;s obviously been extensive debate in the past, with perhaps no agreement on a standard definition.</p><p>In a 1997 post, John Chalmers says:</p><p>&quot;RE Limits: I agree with Paul Erlich about limit terminology.<br/>As generally used on this List, &quot;N-Prime limit&quot; implicitly means<br/>that powers of N and multiples of N with smaller primes are<br/>included in the tuning. Partch&apos;s usage of the term  N Limit<br/>means that N is the largest ODD number appearing in either the<br/>numerator or denominator of the ratios defining the tuning.<br/>Thus 33/32 would be said to be at the 11-prime limit by conventional<br/>usage, but at the 33-limit in Partch&apos;s terms. I think these<br/>nomenclatures are clear enough, but one could add &apos;odd&apos; to be<br/>unambiguous. Statements such as at the &quot;33 odd-number limit&quot; or<br/>&quot;33(odd) limit&quot; should be clear.&quot;</p><p>Jonathan Walker responds:</p><p>&quot;However, the prime-limit modification of Partch&apos;s terminology, related<br/>to the small-omega function seems to have won greater favour, possibly<br/>because it is more open to generalisation. For instance, how do we<br/>specify the limit of a fully chromatic 14th-century monochord, or even<br/>worse, a schismatic 15th-century monochord (i.e. Fb serving for E etc.)<br/>Both are constructed entirely from Pythagorean ratios, and thus 3-limit<br/>by the prime terminology; but if we use the odd-limit terminology we<br/>must say, for example, 531441-limit, even though all odd numbers up to<br/>this limit which are not powers of 3 are excluded. I notice that John,<br/>above, suggests adding &quot;odd&quot; for the Partchian limit terminology,<br/>leaving the prime limit as a default. Have I construed you correctly,<br/>John?&quot;</p><p>Manuel further says:</p><p>&quot;The prime limit definition should NOT be the default, despite its utility in<br/>describing a tuning system. The odd limit definition is not intended to<br/>describe a tuning system; it is intended to describe musical practice.<br/>Despite what Jonathan Walker said, one does not consider music in<br/>Pythagorean tuning to be a  531441-limit system under the odd definition of<br/>limit. Even under Partch&apos;s own (odd) definition, Partch&apos;s music was<br/>11-limit, not 33-limit nor some product of powers of numbers through 11.<br/>Partch listened carefully and came up with the most useful definition for<br/>the ear and for musical practice, not for studying the mathematics of tuning<br/>systems.</p><p>The definition is: A piece of music is N-limit if all intervals whose<br/>(heard) rational approximations use odd numbers up to N, and all chords<br/>containing only such intervals, are considered consonant, while intervals<br/>which cannot be so approximated, or any chord containg at least one such<br/>interval, are considered dissonant. In other words, it&apos;s how high up the<br/>harmonic series (or how far down the subharmonic series) the ear is asked to<br/>go in a particular piece.&quot;</p><p>Manuel, I need to research &amp; ponder further, but do you still stand by this ? Because this seems to make the most sense to me.

There are a<br/>couple<br/>&gt; of things in the message to which I am replying that provoked the<br/>&gt; comments that follow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Joel Rodrigues &lt;joelrodrigues@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello Bob, Carl, all !<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The author concludes that just intonation and exotic tunings<br/>do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not provide convincing rationales for microtonal composition,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while a simple creative impulse to add pitches does, and that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; only a fully functional microtonal equal temperament (the third<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of the three methods) enables the composer to develop a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; genuinely microtonal music.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Who wrote this rubbish, and why is it in my mailbox?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You jest, no ? That is similar to my initial reaction. But, on<br/>&gt; &gt; consideration of the rest of what Ms. Werntz goes on to say<br/>&gt; &gt; there &amp; on this list, I am convinced it is a case of semantics<br/>&gt; &gt; gone horribly wrong. Even the most crazed ideologue in this<br/>&gt; &gt; group cannot intentionally be that wrong, can they !???<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;...only grouping the pitches in a manner which de-emphasizes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the traditional twelve intervals may result in a truly distinct<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and significant form of microtonalism&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully, whatever this means was made clear with a score at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some point.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If read carefully it is, I suspect, the essence of what draws a<br/>&gt; &gt; great many of us to microtonality. Xenharmonics ! For instance,<br/>&gt; &gt; I wasn&apos;t drawn by the prospect of a &quot;purer&quot; fifth (as<br/>&gt; &gt; meaningless as that notion is), rather I was in search of more<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches to play with. Plain &amp; simple.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bravo!  But the next question is always, &quot;On what principle(s) shall<br/>&gt; I organize these new pitches?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whoever needs to make decisions about the future would be wise to<br/>&gt; understand the past.  We arrived at 12-ET because it approximates<br/>the<br/>&gt; simplest rational intervals -- it&apos;s not the best approximation, but<br/>&gt; it&apos;s not the worst either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are interested in writing &quot;tonal&quot; (as opposed to &quot;atonal&quot;<br/>&gt; or &quot;pantonal&quot;) music, then musical acoustics (and the mathematics of<br/>&gt; rational intervals) should be a significant factor in how you go<br/>&gt; about finding more pitches in the octave.  And if you are going to<br/>&gt; use more pitches, then you might as well take the opportunity to<br/>look<br/>&gt; for something that approximates rational intervals better than<br/>12-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The paper concludes with speculation about the applicability<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; serial techniques, as well as the inherent atonality of this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; music.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Inherent atonality of serial music?  Even I know that&apos;s not<br/>right.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Leaving aside the fact that that&apos;s an easily made<br/>&gt; &gt; misconstruction of Julia&apos;s statement, there is no such thing as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;atonal&quot; music. My notion is that people who find a music<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;atonal&quot; are like people who don&apos;t *get* Jazz. A friend of mine<br/>&gt; &gt; often complained there was nothing to anchor her mind to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I first heard that so-called &quot;atonal&quot; composers prefer the<br/>&gt; term &quot;pantonal&quot;, I was quite amused.  That reminds me of a business<br/>&gt; in which every job is stamped &quot;PRIORITY&quot;; if *everything* gets<br/>&gt; priority, then *nothing* gets priority.  So if all of the tones are<br/>&gt; at once equally entitled to be called tonal centers, then there is<br/>&gt; really no tonal center at all, hence &quot;atonality&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Trouble is, even if one chooses to ignore the principles of musical<br/>&gt; acoustics and mathematical relationships, they are still there.  So<br/>&gt; the pantonal composer is something like an architect designing a<br/>&gt; building, but ignoring the laws of physics.  Sooner or later the<br/>&gt; gravity of the situation becomes apparent once the customer (the<br/>&gt; audience) decides that the product is unsuitable or undesirable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I know that not everything is going to appeal to everyone and<br/>&gt; that, when it comes to taste, &quot;mass&quot; often correlates with &quot;crass.&quot;<br/>&gt; But in order for art to be successful, it must communicate, and in<br/>&gt; order to communicate it must have an audience outside one&apos;s own<br/>&gt; circle of artists or composers.  Is this more likely to happen by<br/>&gt; pursuing an atonal or pantonal approach or by establishing an<br/>&gt; expanded harmonic vocabulary through the employment of intervals<br/>&gt; representing or approximating those found above the sixth harmonic<br/>&gt; (while reaffirming the traditional concept of tonality, including<br/>the<br/>&gt; principle of consonance and dissonance)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such is the rationale for advocating the approach to microtonality<br/>&gt; that I have taken.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That said, I should quickly add that the element of &quot;creative<br/>&gt; impulse&quot; (in whatever form) in a musical composition outweighs all<br/>of<br/>&gt; our theorizing.  Without it we have music that is pedantic and<br/>&gt; lifeless.  With it, we have music that is successful regardless of<br/>&gt; which &quot;rules&quot; the composer has followed or disregarded, that speaks<br/>&gt; to us in some way, even if we don&apos;t fully comprehend its<br/>&gt; technical &quot;language.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
