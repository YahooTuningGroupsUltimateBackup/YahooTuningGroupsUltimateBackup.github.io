It&apos;s<br/>the issue of the best tuning system - or what pitches<br/>the ear /really/ wants to hear. I&apos;m sorry this post<br/>is ~10k big, but I had to make sure I made every point.</p><p>What I&apos;m trying to do is take a completely objective<br/>approach and give evidence for and against the two<br/>most likely candidates which are:<br/>The even tempered scale (I&apos;ll call it 12-note from now on)<br/>(2^(x/12)), where x=0 to 12. Which makes the notes<br/>powers of the number: 1.059463094359...</p><p>and the:<br/>Pythagoras system or perfect fifth scale.<br/>(((3^n)/(2^(n+m))) - notes C, G, D, A etc.<br/>or ((4^n)/(3^(n+m))) - notes F, Bb, Eb, Ab etc.<br/>(where m is a fudge factor to keep the ratio between<br/>1 and 2)</p><p>By an amazing mathematical coincidence, these two<br/>methods of obtaining the notes of the scale are extremely<br/>close - for most intents and purposes, pitches are no more<br/>than 1% out between the two systems. In fact, so close,<br/>that it&apos;s almost fruitless to try and listen to hear which one<br/>sounds better.</p><p>What is assumed (and for now which I&apos;m arguing<br/>against), is that the 12 note system has always been<br/>an admittedly good but imperfect &apos;compromise&apos; when<br/>put up against the original Pythagoras pitch ratios (see<br/>far end of doc for a list of these pitches numerically).<br/>I&apos;m wondering if there&apos;s any truth in the possibility that<br/>the 12-note system contains the perfect pitches after all,<br/>and therefore /not/ a compromise.<br/>In other words I&apos;m wondering if the two notes say...<br/>(for example) D# and Eb - are, for all intents and<br/>purposes the same (or should be the same) note - giving<br/>only 12 possible &apos;golden&apos; notes.</p><p>I have researched all over the net to find more information,<br/>but have found few clear explantions on the two systems<br/>and their quirks and &apos;failures&apos;.</p><p>Anyway, here are all the issues I&apos;ve come across in my<br/>search for logic:</p><p>*********************<br/>*********************Pythagoras System - is it flawed?</p><p>*******Issue number 1: &apos;Unsavoury pitches&apos;<br/>[case for attack (...ing Pythagoras)]<br/>I said earlier that the most any pitch was different in the<br/>two systems was by about 1% and was therefore very hard to<br/>tell apart... OK, well this applies to the<br/>immediate 5ths like F, G and D etc, but if you progress in<br/>5ths along the scale....<br/>C,G,D,A,E,B,F#,C#,G#, D#... (let&apos;s stop at) A#.<br/>This pitch ratio (1.80203) for example sounds out of<br/>place in any tune and has a discrepancy of 1.1% when<br/>compared to the 12-note&apos;s version (1.7818).<br/>It gets (generally) worse if you go further out aswell.....<br/>which leads us to the dreaded &apos;wolf&apos; note.....................</p><p>[case for defense] &lt;see defense for: &apos;and he cried &quot;Wolf&quot; &apos;&gt;</p><p>*******Issue number 2: &apos;and he cried &quot;Wolf&quot; &apos;</p><p>...[case for attack]<br/>The infamous &apos;wolf&apos; note (or B# - 1.01364 (and massive<br/>1.3% discrepancy compared to root C)) clashes if it&apos;s played<br/>in any song. The point here is that if /this/ note sounds<br/>wrong, then all the notes that precede it must also be<br/>wrong (to an increasingly less, but still prelavent degree).</p><p>...[case for defense]<br/>I imagine the possible defense Pythagoras fans would use<br/>is that the more &apos;exotic&apos; notes later on (including the wolf<br/>note and beyond) clash, but only if played with the &apos;simpler&apos;<br/>notes like G, D and A etc. (and they&apos;d argue that good tunes<br/>and melodies don&apos;t contain these two extremes in any decent<br/>counterpoint/chord combinations/progressions.)</p><p>*******Issue number 3: &apos;But why stop at the wolf note....&apos;<br/>...[case for attack (...ing pythagoras)]<br/>Notes obtained from pythag&apos;s scale are related to the last<br/>note in the sequence.<br/>Because of this, you could theoretically go on forever with<br/>supposedly infinitely &apos;useful&apos; notes. The 12 note system<br/>is more definitive about just using the &apos;golden&apos; 12 notes for<br/>all tune possibilites.</p><p>...[case for defense]<br/>Ah, but the simpler (pythagoras) notes in the beginning are<br/>the most useful and thus are more likely to be used in any<br/>decent melody. Each note afterwards gets more and more<br/>&apos;exotic&apos;, and therefore should be used less often.<br/>This argument is related to the &apos;wolf&apos; note business.</p><p>*******Issue number 4: &apos;oh, so you&apos;re saying ~1.498 =G ? &apos;<br/>...[case for attack (...ing 12-note)]<br/>A nice method of attack against the 12 note system is the<br/>pure note G (perfect fifth) which seems to require a pure number<br/>like.... hmmm..... 1.5?? It isn&apos;t of course. 12-note G = ~1.4983.<br/>1.498 seems to be unsound because it means that extra low<br/>frequency beat patterns (when played with the note C) are<br/>created and it is thus imperfect.</p><p>...[case for defense]<br/>These &apos;beats&apos; are negligible and/or possibly completely irrelevant.<br/>For example:<br/>Pythag C = 1.000000<br/>Pythag E = 1.265625 (81/64)<br/>The waveform for the note E (in the pythagoras scale!!) for<br/>example repeats 81 times before the sound reloops exactly.<br/>This gives way to many extra frequencies when played<br/>with C etc. The note B has to repeat 243 times and the note C#<br/>has to repeat a whopping 2187 (!) times before that reloops too...</p><p>Even if extra unheard &apos;beats&apos; are a by-product (which is silly<br/>anyway when you&apos;re looking at 2187 repeats before the loop),<br/>this does not have to imply that the pitch is slightly &apos;off&apos;.<br/>Maybe 1.498 is the way the real &apos;perfect 5th&apos; or G is meant to<br/>sound.</p><p>Besides, if ratios were so good, then the number 1.66666 (5/3)<br/>would sound good (when obviously it sounds too low for the<br/>note A (1.68189)). This lends more weight to the argument<br/>that the pythagoras/&apos;just tuning&apos; systems are actually spurious.</p><p>The final thing to say is that irrational numbers like e, pi and<br/>the square root of 0.5 (~0.7071....) also seem too complex<br/>to be useful, but are in fact very important in mathematics.</p><p>**************************************************<br/>**************************************************</p><p>Inherent positive traits (non-arguable):</p><p>12 note system:<br/>A scale composed up of any value /other/ than 12 in<br/>the formula 2^(x/12), sounds dreadful.<br/>I am very much for the theory that the number 12 is a very<br/>special number. Every single number replacing x in the formula<br/>gives a possibly perfect sounding note. All important pitches<br/>covered and no extra added flawed notes. Too much of a<br/>coincidence surely?<br/>Try other possibilites like 2^(x/16) or 2^(x/8) or 2^(x/10) or<br/>whatever, and you&apos;ll get some (possibly) perfect notes, some<br/>&apos;OK-ish&apos; notes and also some bad (wasted) ones.</p><p>Pythagoras system:<br/>Despite the questionable notes later on in the series, the pythag<br/>pitches start off incredibly well with seemingly perfect pitches<br/>just like the 12 note system. Using the various powers of 3/4,<br/>2/3 and their various factors/powers also seems an appealing<br/>idea, mathematically.</p><p>=================================</p><p>I know this text is a comparison on the 12-note system vs. Pythagoras,<br/>but here&apos;s a quick mention of the &apos;just intonation&apos; system (which is<br/>related to the pythagoras system in the sense that they are ratios too).</p><p>5/3=1.6666 : Sounds very strange for the note A. Too high though of course for G#.<br/>7/6=1.1666 : too low for D# (1.1892) and too high for D (1.1224)<br/>7/4=1.75   : too low for A# (1.7818) and too high for A (1.6818)<br/>8/7=1.1428 : too high for D<br/>etc. etc...</p><p>All in all, I think the 12-note (equal tempered) scale has being<br/>given a raw deal and would appreciate any feedback on where<br/>I&apos;ve made a good point or where I&apos;ve gone wrong.<br/>(See end of this text for pitch ratios btw)</p><p>Lastly, I hear that some of the more exotic scales contain 50 or<br/>more notes. hmmmm, I bet that if ever any 2 given notes (taken from<br/>the pool of 50 in this case) sound good together, that&apos;s because<br/>they&apos;re probably close to the notes from the 12-note/Pythag scale<br/>anyway ;-) Either this or...<br/>......the (surplus) &apos;off&apos; pitches are played in between the quarter<br/>beats (or for sound effect) where they are less prominent and<br/>therefore don&apos;t intrude. &quot;I know, let&apos;s make an instrument with<br/>70,000 note pitches! - better than even 70!&quot; ;)<br/>In other words, I believe scales with more than 12 notes are<br/>redundant - at least in terms of producing decent sounding chords.<br/>Only the 12 notes are essential (apart from for sound slides,<br/>sound fx and possibly 8th/16th &apos;in-between&apos; beats - all of which<br/>aren&apos;t related to chords and counterpoint, but are more used as<br/>effects or devices in music). It&apos;s hard to prove this, as I know<br/>so many of you probably think that scales with more than 12<br/>notes are valid (and obviously I&apos;m not 100% sure myself even),<br/>but maybe here&apos;s some evidence: Rarely do you hear tunes in many<br/>channels of rich melodic counterpoint done in scales with more<br/>notes than the Pythagoras/12-note scales.</p><p>Many thanks,</p><p>Daniel (<a href="mailto:dspwhite@email.com">dspwhite@email.com</a>)</p><p>--------------------------<br/>12-note pitches:</p><p>C     = 1.0     (1.00000)<br/>C#/Db = 1.05946 (0.94387)<br/>D     = 1.12246 (0.89089)<br/>D#/Eb = 1.18921 (0.84089)<br/>E     = 1.25992 (0.79370)<br/>F     = 1.33484 (0.74915)<br/>F#/Gb = 1.41421 (0.70710)<br/>G     = 1.49831 (0.66741)<br/>G#/Ab = 1.58740 (0.62996)<br/>A     = 1.68189 (0.59460)<br/>A#/Bb = 1.78179 (0.56123)<br/>B     = 1.88775 (0.52973)</p><p>Pythagoras&apos; pitches:</p><p>B#  531441/524288  (1.01364)<br/>E#  177147/131072  (1.35152)<br/>A#   59049/32768   (1.80203)<br/>D#   19683/16384   (1.20135)<br/>G#    6561/4096    (1.60180)<br/>C#    2187/2048    (1.06787)<br/>F#     729/512     (1.42382)<br/>B      243/128     (1.89843)<br/>E       81/64      (1.26562)<br/>A       27/16      (1.6875 )<br/>D        9/8       (1.125  )<br/>G        3/2       (1.5    )<br/>C    *    1    *   (1      )<br/>F        4/3       (1.33333)<br/>Bb      16/9       (1.77777)<br/>Eb      32/27      (1.18518)<br/>Ab     128/81      (1.58024)<br/>Db     256/243     (1.05349)<br/>Gb    1024/729     (1.40466)<br/>Cb    2048/2187    (0.93644)<br/>Fb    8192/6561    (1.24859)<br/>Bbb  32768/19683   (1.66478)<br/>Ebb  65536/59049   (1.10985)<br/>Abb 262144/177147  (1.47981)<br/>Dbb 524288/531441  (0.98654)</p><p>&quot;Out there somewhere is a mathematical<br/>formula for creating the perfect music&quot;</p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.mp3.com/soundburst">www.mp3.com/soundburst</a> for catchy<br/>melodic music :)</p><p>Make a difference, help support the relief efforts in the U.S.<br/><a href="http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp">http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp</a></p></div><h3><a id=29494 href="#29494">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>10/24/2001 7:38:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:GONGAPMDBBBEKBAA@mailcity.com">GONGAPMDBBBEKBAA@mailcity.com</a>&gt;<br/>Daniel White wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, this is my first letter to this group and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; mainly why I joined the mailing list in the first place.

Welcome to the list,<br/>Daniel. If you&apos;re open-minded, there&apos;s an awful lot you can learn<br/>here. I sure have had my head opened pretty wide at times.</p><p>Just a quick note. If you think 1% accuracy is an adequate criterion<br/>for good intonation, this is not a healthy environment to hang around<br/>in very long if you wish to hold onto that idea.

If this is the case, then I can only<br/>assume that all the other notes (in relation to each<br/>other) must /also/ be off (to lesser, but still<br/>prelavent degrees).<br/>Plus the major third of the pythag system is even<br/>sharper than the 12-note version, which is a bad<br/>thing for many of us (see later).</p><p>Of course, the reason why they devised the 12-note<br/>system was to stop certain note clashes... but maybe<br/>these &apos;clashes&apos; would have sounded OK if they used<br/>the proper harmonic notes (even if they do need to<br/>be &apos;double&apos; flat/sharp notes).

See comments later for my<br/>thoughts on this.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I am very much for the theory that the number 12 is a very<br/>&gt;&gt; special number. Every single number replacing x in the formula<br/>&gt;&gt; gives a possibly perfect sounding note. All important pitches<br/>&gt;&gt; covered and no extra added flawed notes.

In any given tune<br/>(with 31 seperate notes), how many of those are<br/>used overall? (only count those that are used<br/>in structural chords - not any &apos;decoration&apos; of<br/>any sort)</p><p>Like I said before, maybe the best notes in these<br/>unorthodox scales are those that are the ones<br/>closest to 12-note pitches anyway. Others would<br/>clearly be off, especially those that are right<br/>in between semitones (i.e. the dreadful &apos;in-between<br/>semi-tone&apos; or quarter-tone notes ;)</p><p>I imagine that these 19, 22, 29 and 31 based<br/>scales are mostly used in atonal music, which<br/>don&apos;t necessarily rely on melody, sensible<br/>chords or chord progression, but rather rely on<br/>&apos;textural colour&apos; and what-not to create its &apos;tune&apos; :)</p><p>&gt;&gt; 5/3=1.6666 : Sounds very strange for the note A. Too high though of<br/>&gt;&gt; course for G#.</p><p>&gt; It may sound very strange to you, but it&apos;s<br/>&gt; roughly where A was for a few centuries.</p><p>Wow - they never even knew what they were missing<br/>out on ;)</p><p>Also, John said,</p><p>&gt;&gt;or what pitches the ear /really/ wants to hear.</p><p>&gt;Hmmm... are you focusing more on individual pitches, or on the intervals<br/>&gt;they form?  In my listening experience (highly subjective, of course),<br/>&gt;the latter is more important than the former.</p><p>Yup, the intervals.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s hard to prove this, as I know<br/>&gt;&gt; so many of you probably think that scales with more than 12<br/>&gt;&gt; notes are valid (and obviously I&apos;m not 100% sure myself even),</p><p>&gt; I suppose the best example I have to hand is<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/magicpump.mp3">http://x31eq.com/magicpump.mp3</a>&gt;.</p><p>erm... &apos;interesting&apos; piece =) What do you think of<br/>it aesthetically? Can&apos;t each of those notes be<br/>replaced with similar off pitch notes taken from<br/>completely random scales like say... 2^(x/177.3)<br/>and with the tune still being able to give its<br/>&apos;effect&apos; across?</p><p>This certainly seems to be in the realm of atonal<br/>music where the emphasis is on the &apos;textural&apos;<br/>sound rather than any harmony.</p><p>I looked at a few more tunes in these unorthodox<br/>scales at:<br/>ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/hmiller/music/</p><p>...&quot;jack&quot; for example:<br/>This known tune has been changed to fit the new<br/>scale, but (perhaps) any additional notes that<br/>sound good (which aren&apos;t present in the original<br/>tune) only sound good because they are practically<br/>the same pitches as the 12-note ones (which are very<br/>few of them btw) and are part of a chord that at<br/>that very moment is inherently 12-note. Sorry - that<br/>was a bit of a mouthful :)</p><p>The &quot;Porcupine adventure&quot; sounds as though it could<br/>be very good if it was played in the 12-note scale<br/>for instance :)<br/>And the Kaltan tune (which I quite liked) was<br/>atmospheric, but alas, was mostly 12-note sounding,<br/>and for notes which weren&apos;t, I can&apos;t help feeling<br/>the tune would benefit from a total change to the<br/>12-note (or similar) scale.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I believe scales with more than 12 notes are<br/>&gt;&gt;redundant - at least in terms of producing decent sounding chords.</p><p>&gt;What is your criterion for what makes a chord &quot;decent&quot; or &quot;not decent&quot;?</p><p>Ah - this is the fun bit :)<br/>There are obviously clashing chords which /do/ have<br/>their place in music like C, F, F#, and B which could<br/>be (say...) appropriate for a scary movie, but... try<br/>these out on your music keyboard a sec.. ;)</p><p>C#, F, C, Eb F# Bb<br/>...or this beauty ;)<br/>D, F#, B, Eb, F, C.</p><p>Too many notes? ok then, here&apos;s 5.<br/>E, Ab, C#, F and Bb<br/>It&apos;s very hard to make a bad chord with just 4 notes because most<br/>of them could fit in /somehow/ to a tune (i.e. resolve somehow),<br/>but I&apos;ve tried:<br/>F, A, C#, Bb.   ......or maybe..... C, Eb, A, C#<br/>hmm, that was harder than coming up with a /good/<br/>chord ;)</p><p>All these above chords don&apos;t just simply clash,<br/>they also manage to be extremely dull, ambiguous<br/>and generally crud :)</p><p>OK, now take this stunner: C#, F#, C, Eb, G, Bb...<br/>awful huh? But just lower the C and G so that C<br/>becomes B and G becomes F#. A bit better<br/>dontcha think? :)</p><p>To ease the pain of those ear-aching earlier<br/>chords, here are two of my fave chords using<br/>six notes.</p><p>C and deep C in the bass followed by Bb C D F G and A<br/>or:<br/>C and deep C in the bass followed by Bb C# E G and A</p><p>Once again I could be mistaken, but in terms of<br/>the scales with more than 12 notes, almost any<br/>chord seems plausible since they&apos;re &apos;random&apos;<br/>sounding anyway, so any chord ends up like a<br/>&apos;mish-mash&apos; of sound - with one chord effectively<br/>no worse than another.</p><p>But for the (IMO) meaningful 12 note scale,<br/>there definitely seems to be a concept of what<br/>chords sound good and what chords sound bad,<br/>at least in terms of how the chord should<br/>progress, but probably also as a single chord in<br/>itself.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if there&apos;s a mathematical formula for<br/>finding the best chords or the best chord<br/>/continuations/ (which is dependent on what else<br/>is happening in the tune, so is a very complex<br/>issue), but I do know that certain<br/>chords/combinations are better than others.</p><p>&gt;The 12-tET scale has many well-known strengths, which have been<br/>&gt;discussed on this list at great length.  It also has many well-known<br/>&gt;weaknesses, starting, perhaps, with its very wide major third.</p><p>hmmm... it&apos;s (too?) wide at 1.2599 but not<br/>quite as wide as the pythagoras one at ~1.265.<br/>See later for my comments on the major third.<br/>What are its other main (alleged) weaknesess?</p><p>&gt;Have you, may I ask, experienced the sound of a major third, in a<br/>&gt;harmonic timbre, tuned to exactly 1.25 frequency ratio, as compared to<br/>&gt;the 12-tET major third and/or the Pythagorean major third?  To my ear,<br/>&gt;the latter two options are pretty much &quot;not decent&quot;, now that I&apos;m used<br/>&gt;to a justly tuned 4:5.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that you have gotten used<br/>to the new pitch. I&apos;m curious, do you think<br/>you could ever get used to the &apos;old&apos; 12-note E<br/>again?... and if so, would you be missing<br/>anything that you appreciated in the 1.25<br/>(5/4) E ?</p><p>Has anyone here gone the other way from 1.25<br/>to 1.26?</p><p>I tried out the pitches myself as a chord (C,<br/>E, G), using a modulating sample so I wouldn&apos;t<br/>be biased by the &apos;beat&apos; effect. And the<br/>results are inconclusive.<br/>At one point, the 1.26 E sounded better, but<br/>then the 1.25 E seemed to sound better later.</p><p>I also tried the note E in a sequence:<br/>C..D..E..F..E..D..C<br/>And the 12-note E seemed to win. 1.25 E<br/>seemed a bit flat when compared to F, but I&apos;m<br/>not 100% sure.

Or are those pitches only<br/>available in the pythagoras/12-note tunings?</p><p>&gt;I think you may find much of interest on this list, however.  Again,<br/>&gt;welcome.</p><p>Ta :D</p><p>Also, Joseph and Bob said:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; All in all, I think the 12-note (equal tempered) scale has being<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; given a raw deal<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Huh??  I can think of at least a couple of people who&apos;ve used it...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; _________ _______ ______<br/>&gt;&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p><p>&gt;Hardy-haw-haw! That was a good one, Joseph. Welcome to the list,<br/>&gt;Daniel. If you&apos;re open-minded, there&apos;s an awful lot you can learn</p><p>:D</p><p>&gt;here. I sure have had my head opened pretty wide at times. Just a<br/>&gt;quick note. If you think 1% accuracy is an adequate criterion<br/>&gt;for good intonation, this is not a healthy environment to hang around</p><p>I was referring in terms of the biggest difference<br/>between the Pythagoras pitches and the 12-note<br/>pitches. At that amount, the difference is very<br/>discernable - agreed.</p><p>&gt;in very long if you wish to hold onto that idea. After all, a whole<br/>&gt;cotton-pickin&apos; semitone in 12-tET is roughly only a 6% difference<br/>&gt;(1.059463094359...as you posted). 1% is therefore (extrapolating<br/>&gt;linearly for a quick approximation)<br/>&gt;about 1/6 semitone or somewhere around 16.67 cents. That&apos;s considered<br/>&gt;pretty far out around here and I for one have absolutely NO trouble<br/>&gt;discriminating that even melodically, not to mention harmonically!</p><p>Yes, I can distinguish a difference of about 5<br/>cents I guess, maybe less. And obviously, measurements<br/>should be made in much finer increments than that<br/>(which they are).<br/>Btw, for the record: JustlyTuned E = 1.25 and Pythag<br/>E = 1.265. That&apos;s a difference of 1.2%. Do any<br/>people think the 1.265 pitch for the major third<br/>is how it should sound? (it&apos;s even higher than<br/>12-note E!)</p><p>Also Gene said:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Well, this is my first letter to this group and it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; mainly why I joined the mailing list in the first place. It&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; the issue of the best tuning system - or what pitches<br/>&gt;&gt; the ear /really/ wants to hear.</p><p>&gt; Your question presupposes that there is a best tuning system.<br/>&gt; The first thing that needs to be discussed is whether this is<br/>&gt; true, and I for one think it is false.</p><p>Even if the 12-note system isn&apos;t perfect (which<br/>I&apos;m still not sure about), then maybe there&apos;s a<br/>way to dynamically alter the pitches of a tune,<br/>as the tune actually progresses. For example, all<br/>the pitches change as soon as the tune has changed<br/>key. The 12 pitches change back again when you<br/>return to the original key etc.</p><p>&gt; and the:<br/>&gt; Pythagoras system or perfect fifth scale. Why do you think these<br/>&gt; are the most likely?</p><p>Well, I used both of them mainly for the sake<br/>of argument, but perhaps they are the most<br/>mathematically elegant systems. Mind you, I heard<br/>something about using the prime numbers or PI<br/>which seemed interesting...</p><p>&gt;They both sound out of tune to me when playing<br/>&gt;diatonic music, where my ears prefer a flatter fifth.</p><p>Do you mean the &apos;flatter fifth&apos; as in 3/2 ?<br/>Remember that the 12-note 5th (1.498...) is<br/>actually flatter than the just/pythag 5th...</p><p>Also, Bob said:</p><p>&gt;I too saw your post as somehow reaching a<br/>&gt;conclusion based on some very constrained<br/>&gt;assumptions. You are correct that if the only<br/>&gt;thing you wanted to have &quot;in tune&quot; was pure<br/>&gt;fifths and fourths, then 12 is an extremely<br/>&gt;compact system and has no glitches. If you can</p><p>Well, 12-note 4ths and fifths aren&apos;t (allegedly)<br/>perfectly in tune (unlike Just tuning which<br/>(allegedly) is perfect), unless you mean that<br/>they&apos;re close enough...</p><p>&gt;tolerate its approximations to other intervals,<br/>&gt;as billions do daily, then you can choose the<br/>&gt;easy path and stay with it.</p><p>This is my point - maybe they&apos;re not approximations<br/>after all. I see no absolute proof that they are,<br/>though I&apos;m willing to be proved wrong :)</p><p>&gt;You said &quot;7/6 is too flat for D#&quot;<br/>&gt;without saying what D# was supposed to be<br/>&gt;used for, is D# a fifth up from G#, a major<br/>&gt;third up from B, or the top of an F#<br/>&gt;diminshed-seventh? In what key?</p><p>Well, umm.. I meant it as an only pitch - one<br/>of the 12 &apos;golden&apos; notes as it were. So I<br/>could have just as easily said Eb instead<br/>of D# (or 2^(3/12)).</p><p>&gt;This is only touching the base of approximating<br/>&gt;JI with ets, which is one vigorously discussed<br/>&gt;approach. But there are people who say, &quot;why not<br/>&gt;just have a palette of in-tune notes and extend<br/>&gt;the pallette as far as you need for a<br/>&gt;composition&quot;</p><p>Ah - this is what I meant when I said<br/>dynamically altering the pitches as you go<br/>along, or having as many pitches as you need to.<br/>I think that /if/ the 12-note system isn&apos;t<br/>perfect, then this could be the perfect &apos;scale&apos;<br/>after all.

If this is the case, then I can only<br/>&gt; assume that all the other notes (in relation to each<br/>&gt; other) must /also/ be off (to lesser, but still<br/>&gt; prelavent degrees).</p><p>What do you mean? The only stable consonances in medieval music were<br/>fifths and fourths. All the other fifths and fourths in this 12-tone<br/>Pythagorean scale would have been perfect -- only Eb-G# would clash.</p><p>&gt; Plus the major third of the pythag system is even<br/>&gt; sharper than the 12-note version, which is a bad<br/>&gt; thing for many of us (see later).</p><p>But a good think for medievalists like Margo Schulter . . . major<br/>thirds were considered unstable and had to resolve in a particular<br/>way (outwards to fifths) in Medieval music. Their inherent dissonance<br/>and wideness only help make this effect more powerful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, the reason why they devised the 12-note<br/>&gt; system was to stop certain note clashes... but maybe<br/>&gt; these &apos;clashes&apos; would have sounded OK if they used<br/>&gt; the proper harmonic notes</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how using the proper harmonic notes amounts to making<br/>clashes sound OK rather than just eliminating the clashes<br/>altogether . . . hmm, perhaps you&apos;re focusing closely on the 12-tone<br/>Pythagorean system and ignoring the historical reality of extended<br/>Pythaogean systems, especially in singing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like I said before, maybe the best notes in these<br/>&gt; unorthodox scales are those that are the ones<br/>&gt; closest to 12-note pitches anyway. Others would<br/>&gt; clearly be off, especially those that are right<br/>&gt; in between semitones (i.e. the dreadful &apos;in-between<br/>&gt; semi-tone&apos; or quarter-tone notes ;)</p><p>Depends on the context and the cultural conditioning of the listener.<br/>Consider that Arabic music uses many of these quarter-tone notes, and<br/>then consider that they can sound harmonically pleasing in chords<br/>like 8:9:10:11:12 (the 11 is a &quot;quarter-tone&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I imagine that these 19, 22, 29 and 31 based<br/>&gt; scales are mostly used in atonal music, which<br/>&gt; don&apos;t necessarily rely on melody, sensible<br/>&gt; chords or chord progression, but rather rely on<br/>&gt; &apos;textural colour&apos; and what-not to create its &apos;tune&apos; :)</p><p>On the contrary, 19 and 31 were used as early as the 16th and 17th<br/>centuries, and are favorites of _tonal_ microtonalists today. On the<br/>other hand, atonal microtonalists are attracted to systems such as 24-<br/>tET and 10.7669-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;Porcupine adventure&quot; sounds as though it could<br/>&gt; be very good if it was played in the 12-note scale<br/>&gt; for instance :)</p><p>Not sure if I&apos;m to take you as joking because of the &quot;smiley&quot;, but if<br/>this is anything like Herman Miller&apos;s Mizarian Porcupine Overture, it<br/>relies very strongly on the properties of 15-tET, and wouldn&apos;t work<br/>at all in 12-tET -- certain chord progressions would end up a<br/>semitone away from where they started! For another example of this<br/>type of progression, go to</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.htm</a></p><p>scroll down to the bottom, and listen to Graham Breed&apos;s Blackjack<br/>Pump progression.</p><p>&gt; And the Kaltan tune (which I quite liked) was<br/>&gt; atmospheric, but alas, was mostly 12-note sounding,<br/>&gt; and for notes which weren&apos;t, I can&apos;t help feeling<br/>&gt; the tune would benefit from a total change to the<br/>&gt; 12-note (or similar) scale.</p><p>All of us have this reaction when we&apos;re first exposed to non-12<br/>music -- but trust me, this feeling goes away -- it&apos;s just your<br/>acculturation speaking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once again I could be mistaken, but in terms of<br/>&gt; the scales with more than 12 notes, almost any<br/>&gt; chord seems plausible since they&apos;re &apos;random&apos;<br/>&gt; sounding anyway,</p><p>You obviously haven&apos;t spent much time trying to make nice music in<br/>alternative tunings! Well, welcome to the land where dozens of us (at<br/>least) have done so, and we&apos;ll all tell you the same thing: you&apos;re<br/>dead wrong!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But for the (IMO) meaningful 12 note scale,<br/>&gt; there definitely seems to be a concept of what<br/>&gt; chords sound good and what chords sound bad,<br/>&gt; at least in terms of how the chord should<br/>&gt; progress, but probably also as a single chord in<br/>&gt; itself.</p><p>This is just as much true of 19- and 31-tET, as many musicians in the<br/>Renaissance could have told you. And it&apos;s certainly true of most ET<br/>scales. The ET scale where you might have the most trouble finding<br/>any chords that sound better than others might be 11-tET, and maybe<br/>18-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if there&apos;s a mathematical formula for<br/>&gt; finding the best chords</p><p>Well, we&apos;ve thrown some around in the past, and generally speaking,<br/>it has a lot to do with how well you&apos;re approximating _simple<br/>ratios_. While 12-tET is awfully good at this, other ETs are better,<br/>the most commonly mentioned being 19-, 22-, 31-, 41-, 53-, and 72-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The 12-tET scale has many well-known strengths, which have been<br/>&gt; &gt;discussed on this list at great length.  It also has many well-<br/>known<br/>&gt; &gt;weaknesses, starting, perhaps, with its very wide major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hmmm... it&apos;s (too?) wide at 1.2599 but not<br/>&gt; quite as wide as the pythagoras one at ~1.265.<br/>&gt; See later for my comments on the major third.<br/>&gt; What are its other main (alleged) weaknesess?</p><p>It&apos;s not capable of approximating the ratios of 7 (7:4, 7:5, 7:6),<br/>with the possible exception of 7:5. Many composers experimenting with<br/>Just and other-non-12-tET systems have found these ratios of 7 very<br/>musically useful, in a new and initially &quot;alien&quot;, but ultimately very<br/>beautiful, way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried out the pitches myself as a chord (C,<br/>&gt; E, G), using a modulating sample so I wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; be biased by the &apos;beat&apos; effect. And the<br/>&gt; results are inconclusive.<br/>&gt; At one point, the 1.26 E sounded better, but<br/>&gt; then the 1.25 E seemed to sound better later.</p><p>Give yourself a lot of time to listen, sleep on it, and listen again.<br/>Get yourself to the point where you can hear the difference between<br/>the two without looking -- and then take note of the _qualitative_<br/>difference between the two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also tried the note E in a sequence:<br/>&gt; C..D..E..F..E..D..C<br/>&gt; And the 12-note E seemed to win.</p><p>Well of course it did -- what did you do (or not do) to the other<br/>pitches?</p><p>&gt; 1.25 E<br/>&gt; seemed a bit flat when compared to F, but I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not 100% sure.</p><p>It would sound flat because you&apos;re very used to 100-cent half steps.<br/>In the couple of centuries when major thirds were tuned at or near<br/>4:5, scales were tuned to _meantone temperament_ (please read up on<br/>this), and half steps a bit larger where what everyone was accustomed<br/>to hearing in their scales.</p><p>&gt; I didn&apos;t have too many worries<br/>&gt; about how the /F/ or /d/ should be, because<br/>&gt; 12-note F is very close to 4/3 (1.33333), and<br/>&gt; 12-note D is close to 9/8 (1.125) so those<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t ruin the test in any way.</p><p>They do ruin the test. The great inequality between the whole step<br/>from C to D, and the whole step from D to E, ruins the test. In<br/>meantone temperament, these two whole steps would be the same size.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Argh - foiled ;) - (well I can try ;7<br/>&gt; Justly tuned D, E, F and G are 9/8, 5/4, 4/3<br/>&gt; and 3/2 respectively.<br/>&gt; What&apos;s A and B? Or are those pitches only<br/>&gt; available in the pythagoras/12-note tunings?</p><p>Just intonation does not provide a fixed pitches for each traditional<br/>note name. If you wish to think in terms of traditional note names,<br/>you might want to focus on meantone temperament rather than just<br/>intonation for the time being.</p><p>Side note: you simply must stop focusing on pitches and start<br/>focusing on intervals, or else this whole subject will be &quot;out-of-<br/>focus&quot; to you forever!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I can distinguish a difference of about 5<br/>&gt; cents I guess, maybe less. And obviously, measurements<br/>&gt; should be made in much finer increments than that<br/>&gt; (which they are).<br/>&gt; Btw, for the record: JustlyTuned E = 1.25 and Pythag<br/>&gt; E = 1.265.</p><p>My friend, please stop saying E and start saying &quot;major third&quot;. It<br/>going to make clear communication a lot easier.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s a difference of 1.2%. Do any<br/>&gt; people think the 1.265 pitch for the major third<br/>&gt; is how it should sound?</p><p>In Medieval music before 1420 AD, it&apos;s how it should sound. In<br/>Renaissance music, definitely go for the 1.25.</p><p>&gt; Even if the 12-note system isn&apos;t perfect (which<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still not sure about), then maybe there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; way to dynamically alter the pitches of a tune,<br/>&gt; as the tune actually progresses.</p><p>This procedure has been perfected to a very fine degree by our own<br/>John deLaubenfels. See his pages at <a href="http://adaptune.com">adaptune.com</a>.</p><p>But one still might want to make music using more than 12 distinct<br/>pitches per octave.

In any given tune<br/>&gt; (with 31 seperate notes), how many of those are<br/>&gt; used overall? (only count those that are used<br/>&gt; in structural chords - not any &apos;decoration&apos; of<br/>&gt; any sort)</p><p>The only example I have is Vicentino, and that only on paper.  He uses 24<br/>notes, which could work as two keyboards tuned with a usual 12 note<br/>meantone (which isn&apos;t quite how he writes it).  But the chords are<br/>consistently 5-limit, to the extent that any exceptions are taken to be<br/>typos.</p><p>I have played with neutral third scales.  You might find something at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/pelog.mid">http://x31eq.com/pelog.mid</a>&gt;, I can&apos;t remember.</p><p>&gt; Like I said before, maybe the best notes in these<br/>&gt; unorthodox scales are those that are the ones<br/>&gt; closest to 12-note pitches anyway. Others would<br/>&gt; clearly be off, especially those that are right<br/>&gt; in between semitones (i.e. the dreadful &apos;in-between<br/>&gt; semi-tone&apos; or quarter-tone notes ;)</p><p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;best&quot;.  And anyway, it&apos;s putting the cart<br/>before the horse.  12-equal came into use by offering approximations to<br/>the 12 notes already in use, which were *very* close to a subset of<br/>31-equal.</p><p>&gt; I imagine that these 19, 22, 29 and 31 based<br/>&gt; scales are mostly used in atonal music, which<br/>&gt; don&apos;t necessarily rely on melody, sensible<br/>&gt; chords or chord progression, but rather rely on<br/>&gt; &apos;textural colour&apos; and what-not to create its &apos;tune&apos; :)</p><p>This has already been answered.</p><p>Daniel:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; It&apos;s hard to prove this, as I know<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; so many of you probably think that scales with more than 12<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; notes are valid (and obviously I&apos;m not 100% sure myself even),</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt; &gt; I suppose the best example I have to hand is<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/magicpump.mp3">http://x31eq.com/magicpump.mp3</a>&gt;.</p><p>Daniel:<br/>&gt; erm... &apos;interesting&apos; piece =) What do you think of<br/>&gt; it aesthetically? Can&apos;t each of those notes be<br/>&gt; replaced with similar off pitch notes taken from<br/>&gt; completely random scales like say... 2^(x/177.3)<br/>&gt; and with the tune still being able to give its<br/>&gt; &apos;effect&apos; across?</p><p>I listened to it again to see if I still like it.  And I do!  I hope it<br/>works best in the tuning(s) I chose for it.  And I don&apos;t hear it as off<br/>pitch, although theoretically most of it is.</p><p>&gt; This certainly seems to be in the realm of atonal<br/>&gt; music where the emphasis is on the &apos;textural&apos;<br/>&gt; sound rather than any harmony.</p><p>You think so?  I don&apos;t hear it like that at all.  I mean, it&apos;s based on a<br/>repeating chord sequence that ends on a major triad.  How tonal to you<br/>want?</p><p>&gt; Ah - this is the fun bit :)<br/>&gt; There are obviously clashing chords which /do/ have<br/>&gt; their place in music like C, F, F#, and B which could<br/>&gt; be (say...) appropriate for a scary movie, but... try<br/>&gt; these out on your music keyboard a sec.. ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C#, F, C, Eb F# Bb<br/>&gt; ...or this beauty ;)<br/>&gt; D, F#, B, Eb, F, C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Too many notes? ok then, here&apos;s 5.<br/>&gt; E, Ab, C#, F and Bb<br/>&gt; It&apos;s very hard to make a bad chord with just 4 notes because most<br/>&gt; of them could fit in /somehow/ to a tune (i.e. resolve somehow),<br/>&gt; but I&apos;ve tried:<br/>&gt; F, A, C#, Bb.   ......or maybe..... C, Eb, A, C#<br/>&gt; hmm, that was harder than coming up with a /good/<br/>&gt; chord ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All these above chords don&apos;t just simply clash,<br/>&gt; they also manage to be extremely dull, ambiguous<br/>&gt; and generally crud :)</p><p>Boy, it&apos;s a long time since I tuned up 12-equal.  It&apos;s strange how out of<br/>tune the chromatic stuff sounds.  Anyway, yes, these chords are truly<br/>awful.</p><p>&gt; OK, now take this stunner: C#, F#, C, Eb, G, Bb...<br/>&gt; awful huh? But just lower the C and G so that C<br/>&gt; becomes B and G becomes F#. A bit better<br/>&gt; dontcha think? :)</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s a lot better.</p><p>&gt; To ease the pain of those ear-aching earlier<br/>&gt; chords, here are two of my fave chords using<br/>&gt; six notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C and deep C in the bass followed by Bb C D F G and A<br/>&gt; or:<br/>&gt; C and deep C in the bass followed by Bb C# E G and A</p><p>Excellent piano chords!  Yes, this is what 12-equal is good at.</p><p>&gt; Once again I could be mistaken, but in terms of<br/>&gt; the scales with more than 12 notes, almost any<br/>&gt; chord seems plausible since they&apos;re &apos;random&apos;<br/>&gt; sounding anyway, so any chord ends up like a<br/>&gt; &apos;mish-mash&apos; of sound - with one chord effectively<br/>&gt; no worse than another.</p><p>This goes completely against my experience.  There&apos;s a big range of chords<br/>out there, with 12-equal&apos;s sitting somewhere in the middle.  You don&apos;t<br/>get anything in 12-equal as radiant as a 4:5:6 tuned major triad.  Or,<br/>for that matter, a 5:6:7 diminished triad.  (Yes, there are open fifths,<br/>but they sound bare in comparison to 2:3:4:5 in 72-equal.)  And nothing<br/>remotely as sour as a car-horn triad (1/1:9/7:3/2 or 14:18:21) or<br/>1/1:9/8:11/9 (72:81:88??) or a quartertone cluster.</p><p>And turn the vibrato off when you try these!  The beatless sound is<br/>exactly what you&apos;re supposed to be listening for!</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=29643 href="#29643">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2001 1:45:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; The only example I have is Vicentino, and that only on paper.</p><p>Harold Fortuin performed this nicely, using a trombone sound, last<br/>week.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I listened to it again to see if I still like it.
