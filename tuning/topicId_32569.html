However their<br/>posts amount to about a third of all the ones made, so the<br/>archive is going to be a pretty substantial and useful<br/>one.</p><p>I can also do an archive of all the posts by a single<br/>person. This could be useful for those who want to<br/>prepare entries for the faq.</p><p>Any such archive would be for that person&apos;s individual use only<br/>and you don&apos;t need to be in the on-line archive to ask for one.<br/>If it is small enough I can just send it to you by e-mail.</p><p>Also, just to make it clear, in my own off-line searches I will only use the<br/>archive with the authors who have said they want to<br/>be in it, except for purposes of debugging the program for<br/>the selection of ok authors.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
