I&apos;d like to know a bit about this guitar.</p><p>I don&apos;t think Rod is on the list, and it&apos;s a shame because he is keen on<br/>the pros and cons of various re-fretting strategies (interchangable<br/>fretboards, scale length, movable frets, and so on).</p><p>I was lucky enough to get an extensive demo of his guitar.  It is a<br/>smaller-bodied acoustic steel string Martin with a very nice sound.  Neil<br/>said &quot;purely&quot; because it is in JI, not 17tET.  It&apos;s an unusual JI too:<br/>ratios using primes up to 13 (at least, I&apos;m pretty sure) but no ratios of<br/>5.  Rod does a lot of fingerpicking, and is interested in ethnic (esp.<br/>tetrachordal) scales.  His disc &quot;Death Adder&quot; is available from WIN records<br/>and represents what I would call a minimalist style.</p><p>17tET, BTW, is one of my favorite ET&apos;s.  It has been overlooked by many,<br/>perhaps because of its poor numbers in the imitate JI catagory.  But it is<br/>a very natural temperament, approximating a MOS of the just 3/2 (in fact<br/>the next one above 12).  Blackwood, McLaren, Darreg, and the Sonic Arts<br/>players are the only artists I know of that have really recorded music in it.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
