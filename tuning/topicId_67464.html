If by &quot;major sixth&quot; you<br/>mean 5/3, for instance, then that doesn&apos;t appear in either a<br/>Pythagorean or a (pure octave) equal temperament context. Moreover,<br/>the sixteenth note is a funny note to try to make into a major sixth<br/>here. You didn&apos;t mean major fifth by any chance?</p></div><h3>misterbobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2006 2:46:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Could you copy and paste your Scala info here?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, dar kone &lt;zarkorgon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; request for help - 26 tuning query<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   In a musical scale of 26, if the 16th note was a major sixth<br/>what would all the other notes be in a just pythagorean scale and in<br/>a equal tempered scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I used Scala to list all the intervals, frequencies for these.<br/>In equal it comes out fairly perfect.
