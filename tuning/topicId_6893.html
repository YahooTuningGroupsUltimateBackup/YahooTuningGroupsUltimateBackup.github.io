Oh,<br/>what a sweet piece of music it was!  I remember especially the<br/>Pastoral Symphony (aka Pifa): soft, slow, caressing, leaving the world<br/>completely at peace, and perfectly prepared for the recitative that<br/>followed, &quot;There were shepherds abiding in the field...&quot;</p><p>But that was before the Authenticity Police had finished their work.<br/>A few years later, I bought CD after CD in a comic (when I viewed the<br/>final, expensive pile) attempt to find something similar.  Not a chance:<br/>they all played the Pastoral Symphony in fast, choppy motion, exactly<br/>&quot;correctly&quot;.  Many didn&apos;t even include the repeats: why bother, when all<br/>that is pastoral has been driven out?</p><p>Handel himself conducted the work many times (and apparently in many<br/>forms); in what manner did he do it?  *I* certainly have no idea.<br/>Scholars apparently do, and who am I to question them?</p><p>But I pray for a return of the spirit of Malcolm Sargent to the world<br/>so that I may hear that sweet sound again.  Even now, in my ears so<br/>many years later, its beauty is vivid...</p><p>And I pray for a world in which deviation from &quot;authentic&quot; is not<br/>considered an automatic abomination, so that interpretations widely<br/>varied can live and grow alongside the faithful.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
