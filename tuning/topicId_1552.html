I would have thought the opposite, since the main source of<br/>&gt;&gt; beating/roughness of the 400-cent M3 is due to the 4th partial of the<br/>&gt;&gt; higher note clashing with the 5th partial of the lower note.</p><p>&gt;   Yip, that&apos;s what I would have thought too, but that&apos;s not what ex-<br/>&gt;periment seems to bear out.  I have also managed to convince more people<br/>&gt;that a 13-some-odd-cent sharp M3 sounds raunchy more often with a<br/>&gt;clarinet timbre than with any other.</p><p>In terms of sensory dissonance (roughness), I think this can go either<br/>way depending on the absolute pitch of the fundamental.</p><p>To see this, suppose you have a timbres built on a fundamental at<br/>200 Hz.<br/>The partials will be at:</p><p>200    400    600    8000    1000&#x9;(idealization of a violin spectrum)<br/>252    504    756    1008    1260&#x9;(idealized violin at M3)<br/>200    600    1000   1400   1800   &#x9;(idealization of a clarinet<br/>spectrum)<br/>252    756    1259   1764   2268&#x9;(idealized clarinet at M3)</p><p>Here there is beating primarily between the 1800 and the 1764<br/>in the clarinet spectrum and between the partials at 1000 and 1008<br/>for the violin. Since the 1800-1764=36 is in the range for maximum<br/>roughness, the clarinet will be relatively dissonant, while none of the<br/>partials in the violin are particularly rough.</p><p>On the other hand, suppose the fundamental is at 600 Hz.<br/>Then the partials are at:</p><p>600    1200    1800    2400    3000&#x9;(idealization of a violin<br/>spectrum)<br/>756    1512    2268    3024    3779&#x9;(idealized violin at M3)<br/>600    1800    3000    4200    5400&#x9;(idealization of a clarinet<br/>spectrum)<br/>756    2268    3779    5292    6804&#x9;(idealized clarinet at M3)</p><p>Now there is little beating between the partials of the clarinet and its<br/>version at the M3 because all the partials are well separated, while<br/>the violin has beating near the region of max roughness between the<br/>partials at 3000 and 3024 - I suspect this is the case that Paul was<br/>thinking about in his post. Hence I am guessing that you were<br/>playing the clarinet and violin samples at fairly low pitch when<br/>making these observations.</p><p>Here again we see</p><p>&gt;timbre unequivocally affects perception of tuning</p><p>(thanks Gary - this is one of my favorite themes!)<br/>The caveat (or warning) here is that *absolute* frequency also has<br/>an impact. With all else equal, a lower sound will be more dissonant<br/>than a higher sound, but unfortunately, all else is not always equal!</p></div><h3><a id=1580 href="#1580">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Maybe that&apos;s a hint of some sort, perhaps the<br/>clarinet timbre&apos;s hollow character just accentuates tuning errors in<br/>general.</p><p>   It&apos;s definitely tied to range too.  I don&apos;t hear the same effect with<br/>a bass clarinet, which of course has a somewhat similar timbre in a lower<br/>range.</p></div>
