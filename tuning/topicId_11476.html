These sonorities, of course, resolve according to<br/>3-limit rather than later 5-limit principles, and may have various<br/>melodic as well as vertical motivations. Jacobus de Montibus (also<br/>known as Jacobus of Liege), around 1325, specifically describes and<br/>approves the use of a three-voice sonority with an outer minor seventh,<br/>fifth, and minor third (e.g. E3-G3-D3 or E3-B3-D3).</p><p>Secondly, if the main focus of the question is on the free use of<br/>seventh sonorities in a 5-limit context, then I would say that<br/>sonorities with a minor seventh, fifth, and minor third such as<br/>D3-A3-C4 are common for example in the music of Claudio Monteverdi<br/>(1567-1643), and come into prominence roughly in the same era around<br/>1600 as other kinds of boldly treated seventh sonorities, for example<br/>those including a tritone.</p><p>In my view, it is very important to make a distinction between the<br/>practice of 5-limit verticality in the 16th and early 17th centuries<br/>based on a variety of modes and progressions (some borrowed from the<br/>Gothic era and modified to meet new ideals of sonority), and the<br/>major-minor key system established by around the time of Corelli<br/>(c. 1680).</p><p>While these distinctions are often stated in terms of an earlier<br/>&quot;contrapuntal&quot; style vs. a later treatment of &quot;chords as autonomous<br/>entities,&quot; I would propose a somewhat different distinction between<br/>_combinative verticality_ and _chordal_ verticality.</p><p>In a combinative style, Gothic 3-limit or Renaissance/Manneristic<br/>5-limit, intervals generally serve as the &quot;elementary particles&quot; of<br/>sonority and motion. Thus various multi-voice sonorities are formed as<br/>combinations of intervals, and multi-voice cadences often superimpose<br/>or &quot;stack&quot; elementary two-voice progressions to build unified<br/>progressions.</p><p>In a chordal and especially a key-based style, there is a tendency to<br/>derive many sonorities by stacking similar intervals (e.g. thirds in<br/>18th-19th century harmonic theory), and to view intervals as<br/>&quot;fragments&quot; of such chords.</p><p>&quot;Autonomous&quot; vertical events are, in my view, by no means foreign to<br/>combinative 3-limit and 5-limit styles. In 1318, for example,<br/>Marchettus of Padua explains the power of progressions by stepwise<br/>contrary motion from an unstable to a stable interval (e.g. m3-1,<br/>M3-5, M6-8) by saying that both voices participate in the tension of<br/>the unstable interval, and both move to resolve it.</p><p>A progression such as the following, occuring around 1200 in Perotin,<br/>illustrates the use of a bold minor seventh in a 3-limit context to<br/>achieve a very powerful and beautiful cadential moment:</p><p>           D4  C4<br/>           B3  C4<br/>           G3  F3<br/>           E3  F3</p><p>(m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>Here there are no fewer than four directed two-voice resolutions of<br/>unstable intervals by contrary motion, including the contraction of<br/>the outer minor seventh to a richly stable fifth, mutually reinforcing<br/>each other in order to achieve a memorable overall effect.</p><p>As mentioned, the theorist Jacobus (c. 1325) describes the use of such<br/>vertical sonorities combining minor sevenths, fifths, and minor<br/>thirds, and also notes the standard resolution of the minor seventh to<br/>a fifth. Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300-1377) continues to use such<br/>progressions, but by the era of Dufay (c. 1397-1474) a more caution<br/>treatment of the seventh has become the rule, a state of affairs which<br/>continues until near the end of the 16th century.</p><p>While the prominent 13th-14th century use of seventh sonorities fits<br/>quite logically into a complex 3-limit system of verticality, it does<br/>not easily fit into the traditional kind of 19th-20th century music<br/>history which focuses more or less on the origins of 18th-century<br/>harmony. Thus directed vertical progressions of the Gothic era, just<br/>as forceful and compelling to my ears as any 18th-19th century<br/>progressions, often have tended to be explained in &quot;contrapuntal&quot; or<br/>&quot;horizontal&quot; terms.</p><p>Of course, such medieval 3-limit progressions do result from a meeting<br/>of horizontal as well as vertical factors, and the interaction between<br/>the dimensions provides much of the art and delight of the music.<br/>Also, because Gothic music and also early 5-limit music are not bound<br/>by requirements of major/minor key tonality, many horizontal _and_<br/>vertical progressions are common which would be excluded, or at<br/>unusual, in key-based music of the 18th-19th centuries. Each system<br/>has its own logic and beauty.</p><p>Returning to the question of bold seventh combinations in early<br/>5-limit music, which seem to come into fashion around 1600<br/>(e.g. Monteverdi and Gesualdo), Carl Dahlhaus has noted the penchant<br/>in Monteverdi for sonorities such as the following D3-A3-C4. Here the<br/>numbers at the top of the example show beats in a duple meter such as<br/>2/2:</p><p> 1   &amp;  2   &amp;  | 1 ...<br/> C4     B3       C4<br/> A3         G#3  A3<br/> D3     E3       A2</p><p>The bold minor seventh, the outer interval of the sonority, resolves<br/>by stepwise contrary motion to the fifth, as in our Gothic 3-limit<br/>example -- but here in a very different 5-limit setting, where<br/>multi-voice sonorities have a different logic. This m7-5 resolution<br/>between the outer voices leads to the new tension of a 4-3 suspension<br/>involving the middle voice.</p><p>The resolution of this suspension in turn leads to an M3-8 progression<br/>between the two lower voices, with the middle voice ascending by a<br/>semitone while the bass descends by a fifth. This two-voice formula is<br/>described by Zarlino in 1558, and presented as the characteristic<br/>close by Giovanni Coperario (c. 1608).</p><p>To conclude, the use of bold minor seventh combinations, with sevenths<br/>resolving to fifths by stepwise contrary motion, is characteristic<br/>both of 3-limit Gothic music from Perotin to Machaut and of 5-limit<br/>Manneristic music around the time of Monteverdi. During the<br/>intervening 15th and 16th centuries, sevenths are normally treated<br/>more cautiously.</p><p>Note also that in either Gothic practice around 1200 or Manneristic<br/>practice around 1600, such bold seventh sonorities are, of course,<br/>unstable: they require resolution, sooner or later, to a stable<br/>sonority in a manner fitting the applicable 3-limit or 5-limit style.<br/>While we can say that the minor seventh is &quot;freer&quot; around 1200 or 1600<br/>than around 1500, its true &quot;emancipation&quot; from the need to resolve<br/>occurs somewhere around the turn of the 20th century.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
