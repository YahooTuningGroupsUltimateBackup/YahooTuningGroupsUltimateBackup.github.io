In the Clavichord<br/>Yahoogroup whose owner-moderator I am, and whose<br/>member Brad Lehman has been since 1998,  I had on<br/>January 24, 2001 outlined that Andreas Sparschuh of<br/>Germany had made this discovery back in 1998. Andreas<br/>had written a long article with extensive mathematical<br/>and theoretical work which appeared in the German<br/>Mathematicians&iuml;&iquest;&half; Association 1999 yearbook, and he had<br/>earned the Golden Tuning Fork Award of the German<br/>Tuners&iuml;&iquest;&half; Association for it. So anything Bradley could<br/>have &iuml;&iquest;&half;discovered&iuml;&iquest;&half; was an alternate solution to the<br/>Sparschuh hypothesis. That he dismisses Andreas as<br/>somebody who only has a &iuml;&iquest;&half;vague idea&iuml;&iquest;&half; on his private<br/>homepage in my opinion is a disrespectful way of<br/>presenting his own work as the first scientific effort<br/>on this theme. This, and his complete omission of<br/>Andreas Sparschuh&iuml;&iquest;&half;s name and discovery in the Early<br/>Music article makes him a plagiarizer, nothing less. I<br/>have long been silent on this issue, because my own<br/>role, apart from presenting a dissenting opinion on<br/>the Sparschuh Tuning, was the one of the distributor<br/>of Andreas&iuml;&iquest;&half; discovery to a music world that does not<br/>read mathematical yearbooks in Hun language, and my<br/>position as the moderator of the Clavichord Group<br/>forbade a strong intervention on my own behalf. But I<br/>must urge you as the publisher of Clavichord<br/>International to employ the necessary due diligence of<br/>at least presenting the facts, and not repeat<br/>Bradley&iuml;&iquest;&half;s and Early Music&iuml;&iquest;&half;s mistake of omitting<br/>Andreas&iuml;&iquest;&half; work and opinion.<br/>I am sending this as an open letter to both the Tuning<br/>and the Clavichord Yahoogroups, as an effort to pay<br/>justice to a kind German mathematician who isn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t a<br/>member of either of them.<br/>Michael<br/>N.B.

In some countries, without sufficient evidence, this amounts to<br/>libel. History has shown that co-discovery is a very real phenomenon; the<br/>case of Newton and Leibniz co-discovering the calculus being perhaps the most<br/>famous.

For starters, it might<br/>be just plain paranoia about precedence, jealousy, or genuine disagreement or<br/>lack of regard for his work. All of this can happen quite naturally without a<br/>shred of willful plagiary. And one doesn&apos;t have to particularly *like* Mr.<br/>Lehman to see that we are talking about general people princples here.</p><p>You haven&apos;t definitively proven anything below against Mr. Lehman; what you<br/>say amounts to circumstantial and loose arguments that seem very emotionally<br/>based, as if you bear a personal grudge against Mr. Lehman. Rather, at least<br/>in this scenario, you revealed yourself to be in poor taste to not handle<br/>this matter in private. Not only is this potentially libelous, but it is<br/>basically pretty poor behavior to try to publicly embarrass or humiliate a<br/>colleague, no matter what your personal grudge(s) against them might be.<br/>Ironically,you also realize that you publically open yourself and your<br/>motives up for scrutiny as well.</p><p>A grave injustice has been done against Bradley and his character; you appear<br/>to have acted here as judge, jury, and executioner, and, well, without<br/>evidence of any kind except that you find Mr. Lehman strikes you as being a<br/>bit sneaky, it is rather alarming.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>On Saturday 25 June 2005 9:13 am, Michael Zapf wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Francis,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; in the latest Clavichord International, you as the<br/>&gt; editor of the publication announce that for the<br/>&gt; November issue Dr. Bradley Lehman is also writing an<br/>&gt; article for us on his exciting and controversial<br/>&gt; discovery of the Bach temperament (discussed in two<br/>&gt; articles in Early Music this year).

I had checked the messages<br/>section for the WTC question out of curiosity,<br/>stumbled into the long discussion some 2000 posts<br/>back, and therefore decided to circulate my open<br/>letter. The purpose wasn&apos;t to create an open dispute<br/>here, and so far I have answered to responses directed<br/>at me off-list. Bradley has in the meantime posted a<br/>long explanation and apology in the harpsichord list<br/>which explains a lot. For those interested, I am<br/>adding my response to this post, hoping it isn&apos;t<br/>considered spam. Now, where was that ney of mine?<br/>Michael</p><p>Having read Bradley&iuml;&iquest;&half;s explanation and apology in the<br/>HPSCHD-L list, I get the impression that he is also a<br/>victim, a victim of a questionable editorial process.<br/>He states that the reference to the original<br/>discoverer of the squiggle hypothesis originally was<br/>in the body text of his paper, but was buried in the<br/>appendix by the editors. As a result, the reader was<br/>forced to get the impression that the discovery was<br/>Bradley&iuml;&iquest;&half;s. One must suspect, that the editors of Early<br/>Music wanted to create this very impression, thus<br/>upgrading the article to a &iuml;&iquest;&half;first&iuml;&iquest;&half;, which would rub<br/>off on the magazine as such. This has nothing to do<br/>with content but with procedure. It shows once more,<br/>that journalistic principles of quoting and crediting,<br/>the principles of conduct of scientific argument, are<br/>a guideline which avoids what happened in the<br/>aftermath of this article &iuml;&iquest;&half; that its content gets worn<br/>down by procedural arguments.</p><p>I am not a tuning expert and never claimed to be one,<br/>and I never published anything on the Sparschuh<br/>hypothesis because I felt that the quick and dirty<br/>solution which I had presented with the announcement<br/>of Andreas&iuml;&iquest;&half; discovery back in 2001 to the clavichord<br/>newsgroup was far too conjectural to survive a decent<br/>editorial screening. It matched with some of the<br/>anecdotal evidence on Bach&iuml;&iquest;&half;s harpsichord tuning, i.e.<br/>that he needed little time for tuning and that his<br/>thirds were a bit sharp, but there were other<br/>solutions possible for that. The important thing to me<br/>was to present the original Sparschuh idea, which by<br/>itself was also only hypothetical, but had a strong<br/>intuitive appeal, and therefore it deserved to be<br/>thrown into the arena of professional discourse. That<br/>the draft opinion of mine ever made it into the<br/>appendix of Early Music is embarrassing for me, I<br/>never had claimed it to be a defensible theory, and I<br/>never put any additional work into it. Worse, this<br/>little sketch of mine is now presented in the EM<br/>article as the theory of Andreas Sparschuh, who has<br/>nothing to do with it. I outlined my opposing variant<br/>because I felt that Andreas&iuml;&iquest;&half; tuning, which he<br/>presented in 2001 to a class of music students in<br/>Frankfurt and which he backed by a table from the<br/>mathematical yearbook, was highly questionable by<br/>itself.</p><p>The procedural mistakes which overshadow the content<br/>of Bradley&iuml;&iquest;&half;s paper thus were:<br/>1. The credit to the original inventor of the squiggle<br/>was deleted from the body text and pushed into the<br/>annex.<br/>2. The discussion of the Sparschuh thesis in this very<br/>annex never concerned the Sparschuh thesis at all, but<br/>my own sketchy post which never claimed to be a<br/>scientific solution, and it was an opinion opposing<br/>not quoting Sparschuh. Somebody, be it Bradley or the<br/>editors, should have had a look at the source which<br/>was my petty little post, and the discrepancy would<br/>have become evident immediately.</p><p>Professional argument must decide on the merit of<br/>Bradley&iuml;&iquest;&half;s and others&iuml;&iquest;&half; solutions, but unfortunately a<br/>discussion which should have concentrated on content<br/>has been warped by procedural mistakes which should<br/>never have happened in a serious article in a serious<br/>scientific journal.</p><p>Michael</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/>How much free photo storage do you get?
