I enjoyed a visit with him in Haarlem<br/>where he played me a variety of works as well as some fine recordings, one<br/>of a Joel mandlebaum piece which still sticks in my memory. i will always<br/>remember him as a cheerful, gracious, and helpful person who i would have<br/>guessed was younger than this.</p><p><a href="mailto:MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL">MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL">MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anton de Beer (1924) passed away last month.
