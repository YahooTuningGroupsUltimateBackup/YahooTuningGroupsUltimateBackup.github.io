Reinhard cited. But even re-reading it now, I can&apos;t for<br/>the life of me find a clear instruction to performers regarding intonation.<br/>Yes, Ives did have some rather tentative ideas about intonation, but his<br/>application of those ideas in scores was never consistant, let alone final.<br/>Thus, in the score in question, the first page had notations reflecting these<br/>concerns at that stage in the composition, and he wanted the notation left as<br/>it was, but the rest of the piece did not not follow from such considerations<br/>and the notation was unexceptional.</p><p>Let me just add that the title Reinhard choose for this thread bothers me<br/>enormously.  Its immediate implication is that anyone who doesn&apos;t agree to<br/>Reinhard&apos;s interpretation is &quot;unimaginative&quot;:  Am I the only one out there<br/>that has trouble imagining Mr. Ives agreeing to such an authoritarian posture?</p></div><h3><a id=6405 href="#6405">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/26/1999 6:39:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have been very careful not to close the book on the intonation issue and to<br/>that end I am working full time to uncover clues to understanding where Ives<br/>is coming from and posting them to the list.</p><p>The positive thing to do is to gather all the evidence and make a full case<br/>and that is my intention.  Trying to convince a Muslim to be a Catholic would<br/>be more difficult than trying to convince certain prejudices.  When working<br/>with microtonal concerts in the &apos;80s there were many that challenged on the<br/>grounds that microtones were not appropriate for a serious career.  Now it is<br/>the microtonalists that attack each other, much as politicians of different<br/>parties.</p><p>I&apos;m satisfied to end this thread, only to present a full case in the coming<br/>chapter.  Personally, I think people have always sold Charles Ives short and<br/>that this condition continues.  Perhaps it seems like simple audacity for any<br/>individual to presume to read into another&apos;s words things that were missed by<br/>others.  But that&apos;s all it takes for the idea and understanding to spread.</p><p>For Ives to imagine the &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; is for Ives to imagine pure<br/>tuning as given by the cycle of fifths, the basis for the theory of keys.<br/>Just as one shouldn&apos;t review a book or a movie without reading or viewing it,<br/>perhaps one should hear the difference that the tuning adjustment in<br/>performance makes before pronouncing judgment.  By connecting the<br/>circumstantial evidence, I believe we can get to the core of Mr. Ives&apos;s<br/>imagination.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6506 href="#6506">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/1/1999 2:45:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Today I had a nice Sushi lunch with Ted Coons, President of the AFMM and a<br/>Psychology prof at NYU.  I had the opportunity to show him that George Ives<br/>had indicated in his essay on music theory that a C# is higher than a Db.  It<br/>was exciting to read that George (Charles&apos;s Dad) wanted to call the first<br/>chromatic interval, a C-Db, a &quot;First&quot;!  The &quot;Second&quot; would be a C to a C#<br/>indicated.</p><p>George Ives in Carol K. Baron&apos;s article in American Music (Fall 1992) is<br/>ranking (in the Brooklyn sense) on all the usual nomencalture.  This includes<br/>all the usual culprits, the interval names, the written notation, the octave.<br/> George says that &quot;If&quot; one uses the notation for real sounds learned, then it<br/>could be used more effectively.  It seems to me that his son took up the<br/>challenge.</p><p>At lunch, I had the chance to explain to Ted why C# being higher than Db was<br/>so important to the issue at hand.  After explaining he though it necessary<br/>that I tell this to the list.</p><p>If we take a Circle of 5ths from A we get A-E, E-B, B-F#, F#-C#<br/>we have A-C# after removing octaves at 408 cents (81/64)</p><p>If we start an Overtone Series from A we get A-A, A-E, E-A, A-C#<br/>we have A-C# after removing octaves at 386 cents (5/4)</p><p>These 2 distinct operations give a diferent value for C#, though it is<br/>notated similarly.  If Charles Ives insists that a C# is higher than a Db in<br/>his &quot;acoustic plan&quot; for works like the Concord Sonata, Universe Symphony, and<br/>Unanswered Question, then the plan must fit one or the other paradigm.  I<br/>look forward to making available a published score, studio recording, and<br/>matching book to explain all this for release in April 2001.</p><p>Question to Microthoners:  What do you think of Brooklyn Heights for a<br/>location in May at the Quaker Friends Auditorium?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
