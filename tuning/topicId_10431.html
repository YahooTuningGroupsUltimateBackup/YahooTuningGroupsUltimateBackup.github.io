Tuning limit is the regular,<br/>&gt;familiar concept of the highest prime number appearing in a ratio, but<br/>&gt;consonance limit is the highest odd multiple that can appear in a final<br/>&gt;chord, all the more complex intervals needing to be resolved. Thus in<br/>&gt;7-limit 5-consonant music, 7-limit ratios and chords would appear, but they<br/>&gt;would always resolve to 5-limit consonances.</p><p>I agree, and I beat you to it, Keenan -- these are the definitions of<br/>&quot;prime-limit&quot; and &quot;odd-limit&quot; I contributed to the Tuning Dictionary<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm:">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm:</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/limit.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/limit.htm</a></p><p>&gt;I&apos;d just like to comment that not enough distinction is being made between<br/>&gt;dissonance, which can be used, desired, and even focused on, and plain<br/>&gt;out-of-tune-ness, which I would only ever use for beats, as in the<br/>beginning<br/>&gt;of <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/midi/beatgen.mid">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/midi/beatgen.mid</a><br/>&gt;I&apos;ve experimented with various dissonant intervals (especially the 7/5<br/>&gt;tritone) in just and tempered, and the dissonance, or pull to the<br/>&gt;resolution, is incariably sharpened. The fact that they are in tune adds<br/>the<br/>&gt;extra capacity to linger tantalizingly of them before finally resolving,<br/>&gt;without the pain.</p><p>But Keenan, wouldn&apos;t the out-of-tuneness of intervals at a certain odd-limit<br/>(say 7) help to project the logic piece if the piece is in that odd-limit<br/>(say 5)? Wouldn&apos;t you think the piece could more easily slip into a 7-limit<br/>of consonance if the 7-limit intervals were all very much in tune?</p><p>In my opinion, since resolutions operate melodically as well as<br/>harmonically, one should allow melodic considerations to determine the best<br/>tuning for the dissonant intervals, rather than tuning them to a just<br/>interval standard beyond the consonance limit of the composition.</p></div>
