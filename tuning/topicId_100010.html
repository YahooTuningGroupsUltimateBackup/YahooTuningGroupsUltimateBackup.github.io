This builds on an idea Igs communicated to me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Combining A,B, and C someone, I figure, could make a program that creates chord progressions that build and resolve tension in a very listenable fashion using a huge variety of microtonal chords.&nbsp; Making it work with something simple like a scale with 7 or 8 notes would be a great start...then we could move on to things like 12+ tones.</p><p>--- On Mon, 6/13/11, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: guts of my scheme<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Monday, June 13, 2011, 7:39 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      My opinion is that your assumptions and the basics of your thinking, only as I glean from this post of course, are the very embodiment of one of major &quot;glass cieling&quot;s holding microtonal music back.

I appreciate your feedback.  I take init.</p><p>&gt; &gt; responses as  MAYBE     guts of my scheme</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve rushed to &quot;get down on paper&quot; the heart of a systematic scheme</p><p>&gt; &gt; for ordering and classifying a set of building blocks composers of a</p><p>&gt; &gt; post 12 equal temperament music can use which I believe has the</p><p>&gt; &gt; power to &quot;electrify their workshops&quot; and enable them to break</p><p>&gt; &gt; through a kind of &quot;glass ceiling veil&quot; which has lain draped unseen</p><p>&gt; &gt; over the 20th century era music so familiar to us.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d hoped - and do hope - to do a much better explained and complete</p><p>&gt; &gt; job than this,</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Hello -</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;I&apos;ll start by posting to Tuning - verbally only for now - the few</p><p>&gt; &gt; core ideas underlying my scheme for classifying the body of</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;comoponents&quot; or &quot;molecules&quot; which form the basic palette of</p><p>&gt; &gt; uniquely distinct harmonies available to composers out of which to</p><p>&gt; &gt; construct their musical creations.  I&apos;m leaving out music&apos;s other</p><p>&gt; &gt; key elements - rhythm and timing, amplitudes over the music&apos;s flow,</p><p>&gt; &gt; stereo balance, emotional meanings touched on over the course of the</p><p>&gt; &gt; music, ... and so many other things.  Also I&apos;m not looking at</p><p>&gt; &gt; melodic contour on it&apos;s own, but concentrating on the harmonies</p><p>&gt; &gt; sounded in succession as the music proceeds.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;In my particular scheme, I take what I call CHORD TRANSITIONS as</p><p>&gt; &gt; the basic building blocks the composer uses in constructing his</p><p>&gt; &gt; composition.  Generally music&apos;s basic harmonic elements tend to be</p><p>&gt; &gt; thought to be the chords sounded as the music proceeds ..... eg  &quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; major triad on C    harmonic seventh chord on F    major triad on</p><p>&gt; &gt; C     minor triad on A      harmonic seventh chord on F     major</p><p>&gt; &gt; triad on C &quot; could be analyzed into a stream of six chords the</p><p>&gt; &gt; composer had used there.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;That&apos;s how I used to think, but at some point it started to dawn on</p><p>&gt; &gt; me that it is really pairs of chords, one sounded after the other</p><p>&gt; &gt; with a first chord &quot;leading into&quot; a second destination chord which</p><p>&gt; &gt; are needed to say something which can stand on its own musically.  A</p><p>&gt; &gt; single chord sounded by itself with no other harmony, not even any</p><p>&gt; &gt; implied partner harmony, tends to leave one hanging in suspense.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;Is it supposed to be part of music being played?  Or is it the</p><p>&gt; &gt; doorbell.  or......&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;A major triad on G followed by a major triad on C is a pair of</p><p>&gt; &gt; chords having a degree of completeness.  Probably an authentic</p><p>&gt; &gt; cadence occurring in a piece of music in the key of C - at least</p><p>&gt; &gt; with no other information that&apos;s what that pair of chords suggests.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;In short, I take pairs of chords having direction (C major triad</p><p>&gt; &gt; followed by G major triad is not the same as G major triad first,</p><p>&gt; &gt; followed by C major triad)    ...... but C major triad followed by G</p><p>&gt; &gt; major triad IS the same as F major triad followed by C major</p><p>&gt; &gt; excepting for the fact that the latter CHORD TRANSITION sounds at a</p><p>&gt; &gt; pitch level a fourth higher than the former  ..... or at a pitch</p><p>&gt; &gt; level a fifth lower than the former.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;In my proposed scheme, there can be any of 12 chord root shift</p><p>&gt; &gt; intervals - 1 up a fifth (eg C to G)   2 down a fifth   3 up a major</p><p>&gt; &gt; second (C to D)   4 down a major second (C to B-flat)   5 down a</p><p>&gt; &gt; just minor third (C to A)   6 up a just minor third (C to E-flat)</p><p>&gt; &gt; 7 up a major third (second chord&apos;s root frequency 5/4 - just - times</p><p>&gt; &gt; the first chord&apos;s root frequency)   8 down a just major third (eg C</p><p>&gt; &gt; to A-flat)   9 down a 15/16 diatonic semitone (C to B)   10 up a</p><p>&gt; &gt; 15/16 diatonic semitone (C to C-sharp)   11 up an augmented fourth</p><p>&gt; &gt; (C to F-sharp)   *** very close to down an augmented fourth   12</p><p>&gt; &gt; first and 2nd chords are on the same root i.e. root shift is zero.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;Then (first cut) I take it that the first chord can be any one of</p><p>&gt; &gt; five &quot;types&quot; of chord and 2nd chord can be any one of these five</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;types&quot; of chord as I&apos;ll explain.  This makes the number of possible</p><p>&gt; &gt; combinations - 12 possible root shifts, 5 possible types for the</p><p>&gt; &gt; first chord, 5 possible types for the second or destination chord</p><p>&gt; &gt; (12 times 5 times 5 equals 300).</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;For &quot;chord type&quot; I&apos;m taking it roughly that a chord can be:  1 a</p><p>&gt; &gt; major triad, the highest small whole integer to which one of its</p><p>&gt; &gt; note frequencies is proportional being 5   2 a harmonic seventh</p><p>&gt; &gt; chord, the highest small whole integer to which one of its note</p><p>&gt; &gt; frequencies is proportional being 7, its other notes having</p><p>&gt; &gt; frequencies proportional to 5, 3, and 1 (root note) - or a related</p><p>&gt; &gt; inversion perhaps having only two other notes with frequencies</p><p>&gt; &gt; proportional to 5 and 3 - or 5 and 1 - or 3 and 1 **** note - these</p><p>&gt; &gt; inversions aren&apos;t totally identical or equivalent, but they seem to</p><p>&gt; &gt; belong to a &quot;close family&quot; of harmonically similar chords *****</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then beyond the harmonic 7th chord we have the harmonic 9th chord</p><p>&gt; &gt; with one of its notes having a frequency proportional to 9 (other</p><p>&gt; &gt; notes having note frequencies proportional to odd integers less than</p><p>&gt; &gt; 9).  I&apos;m cutting the odd integers off at 11 and a six note chord</p><p>&gt; &gt; with note frequencies proportional to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 is</p><p>&gt; &gt; certainly a striking and unique animal.  Added to these four &quot;chord</p><p>&gt; &gt; types&quot; are the minor chords with note frequencies proportional to 3,</p><p>&gt; &gt; 5, and 15 as well as the root having frequency proportional to 1.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;This scheme seems arbitrary as laid out in sketch form here, but a</p><p>&gt; &gt; lot of ear testing and experimentation with chord construction on</p><p>&gt; &gt; overtones and undertones etc., etc., etc. lies behind it.  I don&apos;t</p><p>&gt; &gt; propose it as a final product, but as something which does embrace a</p><p>&gt; &gt; large swath of the most important &quot;molecular elements&quot; in musical</p><p>&gt; &gt; harmony.  These elements in the palette of musical harmonies have</p><p>&gt; &gt; their own unique psychological perceptual effects and merit a place</p><p>&gt; &gt; in the post 12 equal temperament/common practice composer&apos;s tool</p><p>&gt; &gt; kit.  Very sweet harmonious music can be composed out of these</p><p>&gt; &gt; elements or intriging mysterious sounding music can be built from</p><p>&gt; &gt; them.  They put a great deal more power and flexibility and</p><p>&gt; &gt; capability for creating striking, rarely heard novel effects into</p><p>&gt; &gt; composers&apos; hands.  By contrast, the harmonic materials 12 equal</p><p>&gt; &gt; temperament puts into a composer&apos;s hands have a slight bland</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;sameness&quot; which seems to hang over music composed and/or performed</p><p>&gt; &gt; in that system.  Quarter comma mean tone gives the composer more</p><p>&gt; &gt; power and if extended beyond 12 notes per octave to 14, 15, ..... 24</p><p>&gt; &gt; notes per octave laid out in a spiral of fifths flattened by 1/4</p><p>&gt; &gt; comma (approximating 31 equal temperament) provides a powerful</p><p>&gt; &gt; harmonic toolkit intermediate between the 12 equal tool kit and the</p><p>&gt; &gt; one based on chord transitions with 12 possible root shifts and</p><p>&gt; &gt; chords having note frequencies, the highest integer to which its</p><p>&gt; &gt; note frequency is proportional being 5, 7, 9, 11, or 15.  Two such</p><p>&gt; &gt; chords separated by one of the 12 possible root shifts form a unique</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;molecule&quot; in this most advanced system I&apos;m proposing.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;To repeat a key idea characterizing this palette of harmonies, I</p><p>&gt; &gt; take not the single chord, but rather a chord TRANSITION having</p><p>&gt; &gt; directionally ordered origin and destination chords whose roots are</p><p>&gt; &gt; separated by one of 12 possible integer ratio intervals as the</p><p>&gt; &gt; fundamental element or &quot;molecule&quot; out of which a musical composition</p><p>&gt; &gt; (in its harmonic aspect) is constructed.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &#x9;My initial first cut system offers about 300 unique building block</p><p>&gt; &gt; elements out of which a composition may be said to be constructed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Of course there&apos;s much more to music, but this system is to bear its</p><p>&gt; &gt; harmonic aspects.</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Begin forwarded message:</p><p>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Ralph Hill &lt;ascend11@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Date: June 11, 2011 10:25:05 PM PDT</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jonathan Glasier &lt;jonathan.sonicarts@...</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;, Brink Mcgoogy &lt;mahagoogy@...&gt;, Elizabeth Glasier &lt;glasier2@...</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;, Joe Monzo &lt;monzojoe@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Fwd: ...general post to Tuning:...

After all, that could be nearly as complex as human<br/>&gt; invention, irony upon irony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What drives the model is the idea of affect control - that affect is defined<br/>&gt; by roles, settings, available props, and impressions of events, and that the<br/>&gt; actors will try to maintain their roles; i.e.,if a teacher makes a mistake<br/>&gt; that causes them to look unknowledgeable (less powerful) or possibly<br/>&gt; disingenuous (less good), that teacher will need to remove the deflection by<br/>&gt; doing something that pushes the E and P factors back into the &quot;teacher&quot;<br/>&gt; position. However, when the teacher takes a trip to Atlantic City, the role<br/>&gt; of &quot;teacher&quot; might change to &quot;gambler&quot;, and actions will change if that role<br/>&gt; is to be maintained.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=100049 href="#100049">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2011 11:00:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Nielsen &lt;nielsed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Igs: &quot;Really I think the best thing to use is simply our ears. &apos;Resolution&apos;<br/>&gt; is so relative anyway.

So I don&apos;t associate any sort of artistic meaning with them<br/>whatsoever. To me they&apos;re just things that happens when a nonlinear<br/>operation is carried out on a waveform. So I have no vested interest<br/>in them, and the way that people use the term here is inconsistent<br/>with what I understand them to be.</p><p>I think that people are referring often to amplitude modulation that<br/>occurs at a rate equal to the difference between two frequencies,<br/>which they&apos;ve termed a &quot;difference frequency,&quot; or a &quot;difference tone.&quot;<br/>However, that sort of thing has a phenomenological origin that is<br/>distinct from actual combination tones, which are caused by<br/>&quot;nonlinearities&quot; of the inner ear. I think when people hear the phrase<br/>&quot;phi-based difference tone timbre&quot; they probably imagine some sort of<br/>sweet alien-sounding fused timbre from Jupiter. Although I think that<br/>little quantum units of inspiration like that are real, and that<br/>people are imagining a real sound, it doesn&apos;t have to do with the<br/>technical, mathematical meaning of the word difference tone as I<br/>learned it. Unless I&apos;m missing something very subtle.</p><p>&gt; As far as beating and buzzing, as I have said, the sheer amount of unsynchronized buzz masks any concrete beating. And it&apos;s not just an interesting potential experiment, it&apos;s something I&apos;ve been using regularly in music for several years now, with very positive reactions.</p><p>Buzzing = beating. Carl&apos;s going to have a fit, but I&apos;ll just say it,<br/>because the data supports that theory and I&apos;ve yet to see a model that<br/>makes better predictions. Plus, once he&apos;s ready to resurrect that<br/>discussion, I&apos;m ready to pounce on his argument with the force of a<br/>thousand vicious tigers plus three dying suns. But I&apos;m getting off<br/>track, because what I actually mean to say here is that I don&apos;t<br/>understand what you wrote above.</p><p>&gt; Heh, I&apos;ll find an example in which it&apos;s demonstrated clearly, and post it.</p><p>OK. In the meantime, here&apos;s a little experiment to show you why I<br/>think difference tones just aren&apos;t involved at all: load up a timbre<br/>that looks like 1:1+phi:1+2phi:1+3phi:... so that the difference<br/>between every harmonic is phi. Or you can make it 1:phi:2phi-1:etc. A<br/>&quot;phi-timbre,&quot; let&apos;s call it.</p><p>It should sound trippy and cool and bell-like. Now put some distortion<br/>on it and crank it up, which actually will generate real combination<br/>tones and in abundance, and watch as the whole transforms into a<br/>beating, convulsant, discordant mess. What happened, you ask? Where is<br/>the self-reinforcing combination tone phi behavior that I was told<br/>about? How could things have gone so terribly wrong?</p><p>Well I&apos;ll tell you what happened, Cameron. What happened is that<br/>first-order difference tones don&apos;t travel alone. They&apos;re accompanied<br/>by other order difference tones, like second and third order ones, and<br/>they&apos;re also accompanied by sum tones of all orders as well. Now<br/>&quot;HALT!&quot; you might say, &quot;that makes no sense, because all of the<br/>difference and sum tones should still be in some kind of phi-like<br/>proportion with one another, thus rendering your mathematical<br/>reasoning absurd and your very personality contemptible!&quot; Yes, but<br/>don&apos;t forget that you have to factor in the sum of each tone with<br/>-itself- -- aka for some frequency f, you&apos;re going to get f+f in the<br/>output (first-order sum tone) and f+f+f (second-order sum tone) and<br/>f+f+f+f and so on. Now you have a harmonic series to contend with<br/>alongside the phi one.</p><p>The former is what they call &quot;intermodulation distortion,&quot; and the<br/>latter is what they call &quot;harmonic distortion,&quot; but they both have<br/>their origin in the combination of the spectrum with itself (or<br/>&quot;convolution&quot; of the spectrum with itself, if you&apos;re really hip). The<br/>two don&apos;t come separately from one another. If actual combination<br/>tones were involved, then phi timbres by themselves should beat like<br/>crazy, because the harmonic distortion products would clash with the<br/>intermodulation ones. But they don&apos;t, and hence we know we&apos;re talking<br/>more about amplitude modulation, and abstract applications of<br/>periodicity estimation, and so on, all of which might involve<br/>&quot;frequency differences&quot; without involving actual difference &quot;tones.&quot;</p><p>H0h0! Anyway, now that you&apos;ve heard my mathematicizing, if you still<br/>have an experiment to demonstrate combination tones, and you&apos;re sure<br/>even after the above that they really are combination tones, I&apos;m all<br/>for it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100093 href="#100093">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2011 7:12:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Does it sound like there are resolutions in this?</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ&feature=related</a>&quot;</p><p>To my ear, the chords at 5 seconds and again at 10 seconds, at 19 seconds, 36 and 46 seconds, 1:25...definitely qualify.&nbsp; There is, of course, a whole lot of repeating of the above &quot;resolution chords&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, the phrasing is spunky and enthusiastic, the general mood seems fun, the solos very skillful...but half of the chords beside the &quot;resolved&quot; ones sound off...almost as if they were musical mistakes (think diminished chords with one note off key).<br/>&nbsp; They veer &quot;of course&quot; far as tension for a little bit too long and I find myself losing track before the resolution chords occur...it&apos;s fine they are tense, but being that tense almost demands immediate resolution to balance that tensity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So it sounds a bit like a technical exercise, but with some great small sections that could be made into a very convincing piece of music.</p><p>--- On Tue, 6/14/11, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Theory of harmony between multiple chords<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Tuesday, June 14, 2011, 8:14 PM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      On Tue, Jun 14, 2011 at 11:03 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &nbsp; And I don&apos;t think psychoacoustics alone can summarize that kind of thing that well...only lots of examples of micro-tonal composition, surveyed by ear without the listeners&apos; knowing what the underlying scales are.&nbsp; For sure though...anything that notoriously</p><p>&gt; dissonant so far as Tenney Height, Triadic HE, John&apos;s calculator...is unlikely to serve as a resolving point in music.&nbsp; But so far and the huge amount of chords in the range of &quot;mildly dissonant to major triad-like consonant&quot;...there are so many possibilities that only our ears can tell which ones (in terms of mood and not just psychoacoustic &quot;ease of hearing&quot;) can work as resolving points in music.</p><p>Does it sound like there are resolutions in this?</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ&feature=related</a></p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100094 href="#100094">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2011 7:15:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jun 15, 2011 at 10:12 AM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Does it sound like there are resolutions in this?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_MzdtU2WQ&feature=related</a>&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To my ear, the chords at 5 seconds and again at 10 seconds, at 19 seconds, 36 and 46 seconds, 1:25...definitely qualify.&nbsp; There is, of course, a whole lot of repeating of the above &quot;resolution chords&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, the phrasing is spunky and enthusiastic, the general mood seems fun, the solos very skillful...but half of the chords beside the &quot;resolved&quot; ones sound off...almost as if they were musical mistakes (think diminished chords with one note off key).<br/>&gt; &nbsp; They veer &quot;of course&quot; far as tension for a little bit too long and I find myself losing track before the resolution chords occur...it&apos;s fine they are tense, but being that tense almost demands immediate resolution to balance that tensity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; So it sounds a bit like a technical exercise, but with some great small sections that could be made into a very convincing piece of music.</p><p>It is a technical exercise, it wasn&apos;t really supposed to be a finished<br/>song.

E minor for metal)...but the question becomes what new chords and<br/>&gt; &gt; progressions would create similar moods (and even enhanced ones) in<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonality without becoming so chaotic the mood can be decoded...or<br/>&gt; &gt; respected by listeners.&Acirc;  Realizing, of course, that there&apos;s a huge<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between being respected as a musician and liked as a musician.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=100146 href="#100146">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2011 11:21:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Jun 16, 2011 at 12:08 AM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MikeB&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not sure about the respected/liked as a musician thing, but how<br/>&gt; does 6:9:10:11:12 grab you?

All of the beating will be<br/>synchronized, so you should still be able to identify the notes. And<br/>even so, it&apos;s not hard to adapt to learn to pick notes out of a<br/>cluster. At one point, I had trained myself to identify the missing<br/>note in an octave of notes played simultaneously minus 1 (assuming you<br/>hit the notes decently close to the same volume). This was a stupid<br/>party trick, so I haven&apos;t kept up with it, and I don&apos;t know how good<br/>I&apos;d do anymore with a full octave, but I guarantee you if you want to<br/>test me with a fifth now I&apos;ll get it.

You have produced a number of interesting ideas. Though it can be hard to make musical constructions that other people can appreciate - since they don&apos;t understand completely what went into the making of the music.</p><p>I&apos;ve thrown a lot of books at you in the past - but this one is not dry theory, and you probably can find it in your local library.</p><p>&quot;What to Listen for in Music&quot; by Aaron Copeland. If you have not had a music history / humanities or music appreciation class this book might change the way you view music and make it easier to compose.</p><p>Here is a review for the book that makes me think it could be useful to you.</p><p>Anybody who has any interest in music owes it to themselves to read this book. In this definitive guide to musical enjoyment, Aaron Copeland takes a look at how to listen to music intelligently. Two questions are addressed in this interesting, in-depth study: Are you hearing everything that is going on? Are you really being sensitive to it?</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter what kind of music you enjoy, everyone can get something out of this book. Though relating more closely to classical music, Aaron Copeland&apos;s ideas for listening to music will give the reader a better appreciation and understanding of whatever music they listen to.</p><p>From reading this book you will gain insight into the creative process of a composer. In laymen&apos;s terms, the book describes the way composers write music as well as how they actually listen to it. It explains that there are three separate planes upon which music is listened to. They are the sensuous plane, the expressive plane, and the sheerly musical plane. Copeland goes on to tell how music is heard on each plane and explains how each works, which I found very interesting.</p><p>Overall, Aaron Copeland&apos;s What To Listen For In Music is a good book that I recommend to anyone who has an interest in music or enjoys listening to it. A whole new level of listening ability can be gained from reading this book. It explains music from the composer&apos;s point of view, giving you insight into how music is composed, and how to listen to it, which gives you a deeper appreciation of music.</p><p>link at Amazon</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Listen-Music-Aaron-Copland/dp/0451528670">http://www.amazon.com/What-Listen-Music-Aaron-Copland/dp/0451528670</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  For me it&apos;s always the same complaints...mainly about lack of building tension and &quot;variety&quot;.&nbsp; And that&apos;s even in songs like &quot;Dimension&quot;, my Untwelve entry where I spent a month, a little time each day, adding variation to the piece.&nbsp; Simply put...I&apos;ve come to the conclusion I&apos;m really not made to be a musician</p></div><h3><a id=100156 href="#100156">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2011 4:31:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plus, it is well approximated in a number of relatively accessible<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tunings- 13, 23 and 36 edo for example.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How is it tuned in 23-EDO?

Although I think that<br/>&gt; little quantum units of inspiration like that are real, and that<br/>&gt; people are imagining a real sound, it doesn&apos;t have to do with the<br/>&gt; technical, mathematical meaning of the word difference tone as I<br/>&gt; learned it. Unless I&apos;m missing something very subtle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As far as beating and buzzing, as I have said, the sheer amount of unsynchronized buzz masks any concrete beating. And it&apos;s not just an interesting potential experiment, it&apos;s something I&apos;ve been using regularly in music for several years now, with very positive reactions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Buzzing = beating. Carl&apos;s going to have a fit, but I&apos;ll just say it,<br/>&gt; because the data supports that theory and I&apos;ve yet to see a model that<br/>&gt; makes better predictions. Plus, once he&apos;s ready to resurrect that<br/>&gt; discussion, I&apos;m ready to pounce on his argument with the force of a<br/>&gt; thousand vicious tigers plus three dying suns. But I&apos;m getting off<br/>&gt; track, because what I actually mean to say here is that I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; understand what you wrote above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Heh, I&apos;ll find an example in which it&apos;s demonstrated clearly, and post it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. In the meantime, here&apos;s a little experiment to show you why I<br/>&gt; think difference tones just aren&apos;t involved at all: load up a timbre<br/>&gt; that looks like 1:1+phi:1+2phi:1+3phi:... so that the difference<br/>&gt; between every harmonic is phi. Or you can make it 1:phi:2phi-1:etc. A<br/>&gt; &quot;phi-timbre,&quot; let&apos;s call it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It should sound trippy and cool and bell-like. Now put some distortion<br/>&gt; on it and crank it up, which actually will generate real combination<br/>&gt; tones and in abundance, and watch as the whole transforms into a<br/>&gt; beating, convulsant, discordant mess. What happened, you ask? Where is<br/>&gt; the self-reinforcing combination tone phi behavior that I was told<br/>&gt; about? How could things have gone so terribly wrong?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I&apos;ll tell you what happened, Cameron. What happened is that<br/>&gt; first-order difference tones don&apos;t travel alone. They&apos;re accompanied<br/>&gt; by other order difference tones, like second and third order ones, and<br/>&gt; they&apos;re also accompanied by sum tones of all orders as well. Now<br/>&gt; &quot;HALT!&quot; you might say, &quot;that makes no sense, because all of the<br/>&gt; difference and sum tones should still be in some kind of phi-like<br/>&gt; proportion with one another, thus rendering your mathematical<br/>&gt; reasoning absurd and your very personality contemptible!&quot; Yes, but<br/>&gt; don&apos;t forget that you have to factor in the sum of each tone with<br/>&gt; -itself- -- aka for some frequency f, you&apos;re going to get f+f in the<br/>&gt; output (first-order sum tone) and f+f+f (second-order sum tone) and<br/>&gt; f+f+f+f and so on. Now you have a harmonic series to contend with<br/>&gt; alongside the phi one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The former is what they call &quot;intermodulation distortion,&quot; and the<br/>&gt; latter is what they call &quot;harmonic distortion,&quot; but they both have<br/>&gt; their origin in the combination of the spectrum with itself (or<br/>&gt; &quot;convolution&quot; of the spectrum with itself, if you&apos;re really hip). The<br/>&gt; two don&apos;t come separately from one another. If actual combination<br/>&gt; tones were involved, then phi timbres by themselves should beat like<br/>&gt; crazy, because the harmonic distortion products would clash with the<br/>&gt; intermodulation ones. But they don&apos;t, and hence we know we&apos;re talking<br/>&gt; more about amplitude modulation, and abstract applications of<br/>&gt; periodicity estimation, and so on, all of which might involve<br/>&gt; &quot;frequency differences&quot; without involving actual difference &quot;tones.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; H0h0! Anyway, now that you&apos;ve heard my mathematicizing, if you still<br/>&gt; have an experiment to demonstrate combination tones, and you&apos;re sure<br/>&gt; even after the above that they really are combination tones, I&apos;m all<br/>&gt; for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=100158 href="#100158">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2011 5:27:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jun 17, 2011 at 8:09 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for taking the time to write this.

Highly ambiguous and inharmonic by any traditional analysis, therefore offering a great number of intraspectral relation possibilities to be emphasized, the chord performed with other timbres could concievably sound &quot;major&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot; etc. With sines or straight raw waveforms such as sawtooth, I think it should sound more or less &quot;augmented&quot;.</p><p>You know that this is true of any highly complex vertical sonority, and you&apos;ve probably guessed that when I speak of making predictions I have, of course, already tested to be sure that they are likely to be sound. :-)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you win: I hear the synchronous beating. And if I change the &gt;466.0<br/>&gt; to 476.0, the beating gets all messed up.</p><p>&quot;Winning&quot; is when we can describe things such that running the description backwards, i.e., as part of a generative process, and create more useful material for music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This chord is 1:1.309:1.618:2.

Michael Sheiman pointed this out a couple of years ago here. He did not articulate the point well, hardly suprising considering the incessant jeering and being told to buzz off he recieved, but he did bring this up. I for one will not use the bogus term &quot;periocicity buzz&quot; and will use &quot;isoharmonicity&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The effect is very fragile, and is much more sensitive to mistuning<br/>&gt; than f0 estimation is.

Fragility is something of a problem for me: for all that I work with and love synthesizers, my background and biggest axe are acoustic, as was my point of entry into microtonalism. These particular materials are, for me, reserved for synthesizers or acoustic instruments combined (and let&apos;s face it, guided by) synthesizers.</p><p>&gt;This behavior will manifest for these sorts of chords<br/>&gt; whether or not the frequency difference is based on phi, e, pi, or an<br/>&gt; integer.

If we reduce the variety or complexity of what is created (doesn&apos;t matter how) by combination tones, we do tend to get tangible psychoacoustic phenomena (however they&apos;re caused). That&apos;s not mystical or numerological.</p><p>So you can see what I mean by &quot;shadow&quot; sonorities. Inharmonicity/great complexity in the spectra, but sharing simplicities with simple Just chords, e.g. isoharmonic buzz. A different sound to that of straight inharmonicity/complexity, but related in feel to that of simple rational chords performed with imperfect and noisy spectra. There&apos;s more to it than that- monkeying with the &quot;diatonic grid&quot; is important to me- but that&apos;s the basic psychoacoustic description.</p></div>
