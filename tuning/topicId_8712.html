They both made essentially the same error, which was realizing<br/>that the &quot;system we use today--pooh&quot; is based on the overtone series and<br/>then suggesting that the 12-tET &quot;compromise&quot; wasn&apos;t really enough to<br/>matter.</p><p>Particularly funny, and Partch *loves* to be funny, is a chart that<br/>Schoenberg presents in an article in Minna Lederman&apos;s &quot;Modern Music&quot;  (a<br/>precursor to our current &quot;New Music Connoisseur&quot; -- I&apos;m sure y&apos;all get<br/>that... if not, e-mail me privately...) article 11:170.</p><p>In this he states the derivation of pitches from the overtone series, but<br/>then presents them in cents as multiples of 100, like 12t-ET!  Some of his<br/>&quot;pitches&quot; are as much as 40.5 cents off!  And, he also &quot;forgets&quot; about<br/>enharmonic pitches in his &quot;analysis,&quot; assuming equivalence for different<br/>&quot;overtone derived&quot; pitches which are actually *different* enharmonics.<br/>Hilarious.</p><p>Finally, I&apos;ve been thinking a little about the problems between Harry<br/>Partch and my own personal &quot;mentor&quot; (me and a *LOT* of other people) Otto<br/>Luening.</p><p>As many of you may be aware, Otto wrote the introduction to the *ORIGINAL*<br/>_Genesis of a Music_.  Partch took out the intro. from the later<br/>editions...</p><p>Problem was, as Otto related it, Partch had applied for a Guggenheim and<br/>asked Otto to review his materials... some of which, if I have it correct,<br/>was _Genesis_ itself...</p><p>Otto took too long to respond, and Partch was furious.  Relations were<br/>never the same between them...</p><p>In Otto&apos;s defense, though, just think about it.  1) Otto had a full<br/>teaching load at Barnard College and was *very* busy, as well as doing his<br/>&quot;regular&quot; composing, which he maintained diligently<br/>2) Partch was not a &quot;iconic legend&quot; as he is today....  He was, at that<br/>time a marginal figure who had been, like a lot of people, a hobo during<br/>the depression.  How was Otto to know he wasn&apos;t just a &quot;crank?&quot;</p><p>Otto had his reputation to maintain and he really *HAD* to go over Partch&apos;s<br/>materials carefully.  How would he know if they made any sense??  And as we<br/>all know, Partch&apos;s theories take *SOME TIME* to digest properly.</p><p>As I recall, Partch&apos;s application to the Guggenheim failed at that round<br/>without Otto&apos;s endorsement.  I believe (Partch historians please correct me<br/>if I&apos;m wrong) that Partch *DID* get a Guggi later...</p><p>________________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
