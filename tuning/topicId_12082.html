I just wanted to add<br/>that my initial hope for the 144-tET notation was a pretty simple (and<br/>for me) practical one. At that time I still had some dim and wayward<br/>wisp of a hope that some of my pieces might someday be performed by<br/>someone other than myself, and I saw this as the best bet, notation<br/>wise anyway, for free pitch instruments to legitimately approximate<br/>the various composites of tuning systems that I was using. My<br/>reasoning was that those who could already tackle the 72-tET<br/>notation -- which I had learned from Joe Maneri, or more accurately<br/>from Joe&apos;s book which he had kindly given to me -- could then approach<br/>the modified glyphs much as most performers tend to approach the<br/>various varieties of quartertone notations: as a note approximately<br/>halfway between one (familiar) note and another. Needless to say none<br/>of this ever happened, but I went ahead with the notational conversion<br/>of a lot of scores anyway as I was on a roll (to nowhere of course).</p><p>Dan</p></div>
