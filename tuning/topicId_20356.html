What pieces were written for the<br/>ANS synthesizer by such composers as Schnittke, Denisov and<br/>Gubaidulina?<br/>KREICHI: In December 1966 the Electronic Music Studio was finally<br/>opened. This was an official orga-nization, in which it was possible<br/>to work on a daily basis from morning to night. Before the Studio was<br/>opened up in the Scriabin Museum, the work with the ANS was done on a<br/>very fragmented level, since the main burden of the museum was<br/>tending<br/>to the visitors, which came to the Museum every day and walked around<br/>the rooms of Scriabin&apos;s apartment and where tours of the apartment<br/>were held continu-ously, so the only time we could work at the ANS<br/>wholeheartedly was Wednesday, which was when the Museum was closed to<br/>the general public. When the Studio opened up working conditions<br/>impro-ved tremendously. We were given practically a limitless amount<br/>of time from morning until very late in the evening, and this is why<br/>many composers came to the Studio, whenever they had time - not only<br/>the ones who experimented with the ANS but many others. I had the<br/>experience of working with a number of older-generation Soviet<br/>composers, such as Andrei Eshpai and Yuri Levitin, who wrote a<br/>numerous amount of movie music, so they often had need of unstandard<br/>effects in their music. With-out bothering to get into the technical<br/>side of working with the ANS, they merely expressed their wi-shes<br/>verbally concerning the sounding fragments, which they wanted to<br/>obtain. I tried to carry out their wishes by following their words<br/>and<br/>trying to get close to what they wanted, by drawing different<br/>&quot;sco-res&quot; and then sounding them out. Sometimes they approved of the<br/>sounds that I offered them at once, while at other times I had to<br/>change some things, but at the end we came to mutual agreement that a<br/>certain musical episode would do well in the film. I had many<br/>meetings<br/>of this kind with a wide assort-ment of composers of movie music.<br/>There was also a group of composers who were trying to find new means<br/>of musical expression not merely in popular genres but in music of a<br/>more serious plan. These were Schnittke, Denisov, and Gubaidulina,<br/>who<br/>regularly came to work in the Studio. Another interes-ting musician<br/>who came, was Pyotr Meshchianinov, who worked at the USSR State<br/>Orchestra under Evgeny Svetlanov; he was a very good pianist and also<br/>worked very intensively in the realm of music theory. One of the<br/>musical achievements of Meshchianinov was that he intensely studied<br/>the intervallic systems, including various modal constructions,<br/>systems and pitch sets. the bases of their construction as well as<br/>the<br/>different means of elaboration of Murzin&apos;s seventy-two-tone<br/>temperament. I know that he has written a numerous amount of<br/>theoretical works on this subject, and at a certain period of time<br/>there were even some talk about the publication of his major book<br/>which had all of this research. I have attended a number of music<br/>theory seminars at the Composers&apos; Union Building, in which<br/>Meshchiani-nov presented his treatises about his system.<br/>Unfortunately<br/>I don&apos;t know what was the fate of his book and if it was published. I<br/>only know that he lived in Germany for a certain time, though I do<br/>not<br/>know whether he returned to Russia or not. Schnittke, Denisov and<br/>Gubaidulina each wrote one piece for the ANS - that was probably as<br/>much as the instrument could be of use to them, as they were much<br/>more<br/>busy composing orchestral, chamber and vocal music. Nevertheless the<br/>ANS was undoubtedly an im-portant part of their musical development,<br/>which, most likely, has exerted a certain amount of influence on them<br/>and on other musical compositions of theirs. Each one of them<br/>approached very seriously the work on the synthesizer and on<br/>realizing<br/>the musical conception which they set up for themselves. Schnittke<br/>wrote one piece for the ANS, which he titled The Torrent, which was<br/>all built upon the over-tones of the pitch C. Moreover, the<br/>overtones,<br/>which were used there, extended over a hundred in their total amount.<br/>They were all calculated and compiled on the ANS, and each of the<br/>overtones carried an important function: it was not merely present in<br/>the sound, but it also played the role of a polyphonic voice in the<br/>overall sound construction. There were no other sounds in the piece<br/>other than overtones, nevertheless, certain particular overtones<br/>could<br/>expand, nevertheless maintaining its primal pitch corres-pondingly,<br/>or<br/>to contract back into its original form. In its overall form the<br/>piece<br/>was built on the prin-ciple of two expanding waves of sound, hence<br/>the<br/>title The Torrent. It really creates the impression of a torrent of<br/>water or avalanche, approaching from afar, which subsequently<br/>resides.<br/>Denisov&apos;s piece car-ries the title Singing of Birds. He approached<br/>the<br/>ANS from the position of musique concrete, which in this case,<br/>comprised the basis for all the parameters of the composition. The<br/>musical, or to be more exact, the sound material, which he built the<br/>composition, was derived from a record, which was publi-shed by the<br/>renowned traveler Veprintsev, carrying the same title. Out of this<br/>recording Denisov chose those sounds which were to be used in his<br/>composition, and then searched for those types of timbres on the ANS,<br/>which would be close to them timbrally. All of these bird sounds<br/>conglomerated into one whole unified work of art, without any of them<br/>contradicting one another. In addition to that he utilized a prepared<br/>piano in the piece, as many birds created percussive or cracking<br/>sounds. For these reasons, the sounds of the prepared piano blended<br/>very well with the total conglomeration of sounds and that was what<br/>the whole composition was based upon. Subsequently the idea to<br/>include<br/>the piano into the piece gave means for the concert version of the<br/>piece with a solo pianist. I know that the first performer of this<br/>piece was Alexei Lubimov, who played this piece of Denisov in his<br/>concerts. I do not know if the piece had any other performers,<br/>though,<br/>according to Denisov, the composition could be performed not only<br/>with<br/>a pianist but with other solo instruments, the choice of which would<br/>be determined du-ring the course of the life of the composition<br/>itself. As far as Gubaidulina&apos;s The Living - the Non Living, she took<br/>the human voice as a basic conceptual element of the piece - not the<br/>singing voice but the in-tonational sound of speech. She invited one<br/>actress, who was a friend of hers, and asked her to create an<br/>assortment of contrasting emotional sounds, which comprised<br/>different,<br/>contrasting elements of hu-man speech, that were able to express<br/>various emotions and interjections and be prominent in living speech,<br/>but were not in themselves complete words. The actress pronounced a<br/>wide assortment of such sounds and then, similarly to the case with<br/>Denisov&apos;s Singing of Birds, a certain amount was selected for the<br/>composition and sounds similar to them were created on the ANS. As it<br/>is possible to draw on the ANS by means of the coder not only pitch<br/>relationships and definite rhythmic durations (in this sense any<br/>musical score, notated conventionally, could also be transcribed to<br/>the language of the ANS, in which case it would likewise sound out),<br/>but any other possible free drawings, which also would be transformed<br/>into sounds and all types of human exclamations, including those not<br/>containing words, it follows that they can be conveyed quite<br/>precisely<br/>by means of a &quot;drawing&quot; on the ANS. The greater amount of the sounds,<br/>created by Gubaidulina for this piece, were written in a way as to<br/>try<br/>to obtain a certain similarity of this kind of human voice sounding.<br/>Moreover, there was also a distinct contrast pre-sent between those<br/>sounds that resembled more overtly the human voice with those, which<br/>had a more definite electronic sound to them. Most likely these<br/>components to the piece served as a basis to the programmatic content<br/>in Gubaidulina&apos;s piece. The Living - the Not-Living - is the<br/>juxtaposition of two musical perceptions. One could say that there<br/>was<br/>not a literary program for the piece, which was stated explicitly,<br/>nevertheless, when you hear the piece, you have a sense that a<br/>certain<br/>hidden program or lite-rary subject does exist in the piece. The work<br/>also featured timbral imitations on the ANS of real bells of a medium<br/>size: they were brought into the studio and were sounded out there<br/>and<br/>recorded on a tape recorder. One final feature of the composition was<br/>a depiction of a church choir sounding in a some-what transformed<br/>manner, which is modified in sound almost to the level of not being<br/>recognizable. It did not contain any audible words, of course, but<br/>nevertheless the sounds carried the audible connota-tion that this<br/>was<br/>definitely a church choir and it serves a certain important function<br/>throughout the whole composition as a timbral element of color.<br/>ROVNER: How would you describe your own compositions for the ANS,<br/>especially those that were recorded on the first record?<br/>KREICHI: I had three of my compositions recorded on the first ANS<br/>record - the film music, which I wrote together with Artemiev, then a<br/>short piece titled as An Echo of the East, in which I experimented to<br/>a limited degree with the microtonal intervals of the 72-note<br/>temperament. I took two intervals of a perfect fourth and divided<br/>them<br/>in half, which resulted in a new, strange type of mode - a pentatonic<br/>scale constructed out of equal-tempered intervals of 5/4 of a tone,<br/>which contained three perfect fourths. These were the intervals on<br/>which the piece was built and it had a strong Eastern flavor. When<br/>the<br/>piece was written. I left it untitled, but when the opportunity arose<br/>to have it recorded on the LP re-cord, Murzin suggested the name. The<br/>third piece, Intermezzo was written in a more light, popular vein. In<br/>the piece I wanted to come as close as I possibly could to<br/>recognizable instrumental timbres. I was successful to a certain<br/>degree, but still the piece sounds for the most part as an electronic<br/>piece, though occasionally one can discern a few instrumental timbres<br/>- at times a hint of a flute passes by or at other times that of a<br/>clarinet.<br/>ROVNER: Did you or any of the other composers who were working at the<br/>Electronic Music Studio in Moscow have any Western electronic music<br/>at<br/>the time that you started to work with the ANS, or did you achieve<br/>the<br/>musical results of your work totally by yourselves?<br/>KREICHI: When we started to work with the ANS in 1960 we had<br/>absolutely no knowledge of what was achieved in this realm by our<br/>colleagues in other countries. Much later, in the late 60&apos;s,<br/>Schnittke, Denisov, and Gubaidulina shared with us on an individual<br/>basis those recordings of European compo-sers, which they had<br/>available, which they were able to obtain from musicians, who had a<br/>chance to vi-sit Europe or those who came from Europe on tours. This<br/>way I was finally able to become acquainted with the compositions of<br/>Boulez and Stockhausen, but that was already after I mastered the<br/>musical and technical peculiarities of the ANS and wrote a few<br/>important pieces utilizing it.<br/>ROVNER: Under what circumstances was the Electronic Music Studio<br/>closed in I975?<br/>KREICHI: The first direct steps in attempting to close down the<br/>Studio<br/>began immediately after Mur-zin&apos;s death. Since he was an<br/>authoritative<br/>figure, he was able to keep its prestige intact, and during his<br/>lifetime nobody had dared to utter a word about even a remote<br/>possibility of closing it down. The big-gest problem from the start<br/>was that the Electronic Studio has been opened as a branch of the<br/>Melodiya record company, which was extremely reluctant to contain<br/>within itself an additional structure that did not bring it the least<br/>bit of profit, since the company was a purely commercial one and its<br/>main activity was the edition and the sales of records. The people<br/>who<br/>ran it received certain awards for their busi-ness endeavors. These<br/>people started to declare that the existence of such a Studio, which<br/>does not bring in the least amount of profit to the Melodiya company,<br/>was spoiling their financial records and that with the opening up of<br/>the Studio they have been receiving less profit and less financial<br/>awards. Despite this fact, they, nevertheless, had to put up with the<br/>Studio&apos;s existence, since it existed under the patronage of the<br/>Ministry of Culture. But when the three composers, Schnittke,<br/>Denisov,<br/>and Gubaidu-lina appeared in the Studio, the offensive attitudes<br/>towards the Studio increased even further. These composers, whose<br/>names at that time were already well known, were constantly<br/>undergoing<br/>persecu-tion from the Soviet authorities for their avant-gardistic<br/>musical tendencies. The only place where they had a certain amount of<br/>freedom was in the realm of movie music. The greatest amount of<br/>censure was exerted on their orchestral and chamber music, which did<br/>not go in accord with the prescribed Soviet &quot;norms.&quot; I know that all<br/>concert organizations were virtually forbidden to include into their<br/>repertoire the music of these composers, even if some of the most<br/>famous performers wanted to perform it. When in the beginning of the<br/>1970&apos;s a selection of compositions was prepared for the second LP<br/>record of compositions written on the ANS and shown on the artistic<br/>council of the Melodiya company, the artis-tic council hesitated to<br/>make any definite decision about releasing the record, out of fear<br/>that these three composers were included, but appealed to its general<br/>director for his final word. The general director at that time was<br/>Mokhov, who later became the assistant to the Minister of Culture. He<br/>did not do more than to read the names of the composers on the<br/>program<br/>of the record and retorted: &quot;If the program inc-ludes Schnittke, I<br/>will not even listen to it!&quot; So the artistic council decided to wait<br/>until the release of the record. This waiting period turned out to be<br/>very long as the record came out only in the late 1980&apos;s, most<br/>likely,<br/>due to the support of Artemiev. By that time he had already become a<br/>famous composer, due to the music he wrote for the films Solaris and<br/>The Mirror and as far as I know he also took part in the films of<br/>Tarkovsky. So by the late 80&apos;s it was already impossible to disregard<br/>the authority of Arte-miev and he was able to push through and help<br/>release the record, which was released under the name A Musical<br/>Offering. From the time that the material for the second record was<br/>rejected, the people who wished the Studio to be closed, went on an<br/>open offensive position, motivating their actions that the studio has<br/>become a haven for avant-gardists, and this does not tie in with the<br/>official party politics, en-dorsed by the Ministry of Culture.<br/>Attempts were made to take more decisive steps to close it down and,<br/>finally, a very simple solution was found on how to close it &quot; the<br/>Electronic Music Studio was offi-cially renamed as one of the minor<br/>recording studio departments. As soon as the Electronic Music Stu-dio<br/>stopped being an independent organization and was turned into a<br/>department, closing this depart-ment was merely an elementary action<br/>for the director. At the end everybody already washed their hands<br/>concerning this matter - both the Ministry of Culture and the<br/>Melodiya<br/>company. The director took the simple final step of issuing the order<br/>&quot;this department is to be closed down&quot; since it did not bring any<br/>profit and was of no use, and so forth. And that was it. As a result<br/>the Electronic Music Stu-dio ceased to exist. The year was 1975.<br/>ROVNER: What was the subsequent fate of the ANS synthesizer and your<br/>own musical activities after the Studio was closed in 1975? How did<br/>you manage to save the ANS and to transfer it into the Lin-guistic<br/>Department of Moscow State University?<br/>KREICHI: Back in 1972 I was offered an additional job at Moscow<br/>University - to work with synthesis of sounding speech on the ANS.<br/>Three educational institutions - Moscow University, the Institute of<br/>Foreign Languages in Moscow (which is now called the Linguistics<br/>University) and the Institute of Re-mote Communication in St.<br/>Petersburg - appealed to the director of the Studio for permission to<br/>use the ANS synthesizer to conduct experiments in synthesis of<br/>sounding human speech and have received approval. This paved the way<br/>for new experiments, utilizing the ANS in a new way. That was the<br/>first time that I had encountered the domain of research of<br/>construction of speech. It was very intriguing for me, just as in the<br/>beginning, when I first approached the domain of electronic music and<br/>the ANS. The most important and most interesting phenomenon in the<br/>instrument was that that it could recreate a sound, which was not<br/>initially recorded on a microphone. For instance a flute is sounded,<br/>which never existed, on which no one ever played, which nobody ever<br/>held in his hand or has never blown into it - it was merely drawn on<br/>the score of the synthesizer and it started to sound. That was the<br/>most impor-tant element in the work which was the most intriguing for<br/>me. So when the opportunity arose for me to take part in the work on<br/>synthesis of human speech, I accepted it immediately, as it was a<br/>very<br/>essen-tial and intriguing phenomenon for me that a voice of a person<br/>will be heard, who has never existed. I started to experiment widely<br/>in this domain, and what greatly aided me was that the people, who<br/>had<br/>studied the construction of speech for a longer time than I have,<br/>have<br/>by that time developed certain va-rious rules for conducting this<br/>kind<br/>of work. The elements of language and sounding speech have been<br/>already expressed in purely mathematical terms - in mathematical<br/>categories and even according to physical measurements of electric<br/>and<br/>acoustic signals. The ANS synthesizer was just the ideal instru-ment,<br/>which could be used to realize all of this into sound. Using these<br/>established rules one could syn-thesize speech, which has never come<br/>from the mouth of a living person. It was all very interesting for<br/>me;<br/>I started to pursue this field actively and to achieve definite<br/>results - at the beginning they amounted to certain simple phrases<br/>like &quot;Mom went to market.&quot; Afterwards the phrases created became more<br/>complicated and the work was getting more exciting.<br/>At that time I still worked in two places - at Moscow University and<br/>at the Electronic Music Studio up to the moment that it was entirely<br/>closed down. It was this circumstance that helped me at that critical<br/>moment to preserve the ANS synthesizer by relocating it to the<br/>Recording Studio of the Laboratory for Structural Linguistics of the<br/>Philology Department at Moscow University. There it has remained up<br/>to<br/>the present day and has been actively in use. I myself work on it<br/>frequently and other composers come here to work on it too, they leam<br/>how to use it and then compose music, most importantly composition<br/>students of the Russian Gnessin Music Academy. Occasionally<br/>specialists from other countries come to Russia to become acquainted<br/>with the ANS.</p><p>ROVNER: What kind of musical activities did you pursue within the<br/>realm of electronic music during the last ten years? It is known to<br/>me<br/>that you became a member of the Association of Electro-Acoustic Music<br/>in Moscow and that your compositions are regularly performed at the<br/>Alternativa and Moscow Autumn contemporary music festivals in Moscow<br/>and you also had a number of performances in Bourges, France.</p><p>KREICHI: I continued my activities in music composition mostly in the<br/>sphere of music for theater, of-ten composing music for dramatic<br/>theater. Since during those years that I worked at the Electronic<br/>Mu-sic Studio, I had to deal much with theater directors and with<br/>students who were graduating from Thea-ter and Cinema Departments in<br/>universities, and also wrote music in collaboration with Artemiev,<br/>Levi-tin and Eshpai. Dramatic theater had always appealed to me and<br/>whenever I received offers from uni-versity graduates to take part in<br/>a theatrical production, which they had to set up as their final<br/>diploma presentations or in any other theatrical production, I never<br/>turned them down. I have written music to a theatrical production of<br/>the Lvov Theater of a play by Konstantin Simonov, Friends Remain<br/>Friends, and then for a Moscow regional dramatic theater to the<br/>production of a play called Restless Old Age. There, according to the<br/>plans of the director, there had to be a sound atmosphere created of<br/>the time and scene of action, and here, upon taking the job, for the<br/>first time I had experience with musique con-crete, since I wanted<br/>not<br/>only to present a background of city noises, but something much<br/>greater and more expressive, tying it with the scene of action. I<br/>suddenly understood that each sound of this see-ming chaos has its<br/>own<br/>pitch, duration and dynamic. If there is a possibility to dissect<br/>this<br/>&quot;chaos&quot; with scissors (at that time that was the only way they worked<br/>with magnetic tape), then the separated ele-ments could be<br/>reassembled<br/>following one&apos;s own construction and, in this manner creating a<br/>musical composition. I know that Schaeffer has a composition called<br/>Railway Station. I was able to create a composition similar to that<br/>in<br/>its effects - it featured factory sirens and church bells tolling<br/>(interplays between those that were closer and further off), tower<br/>bells, some kind of footsteps, marching foot-steps, horses and,<br/>finally, all of this concluded with sounds of a wind orchestra,<br/>coming<br/>as if out from the corner, out of a nearby street and then gradually<br/>marching away. This resulted in a piece in the genre of musique<br/>concrete, called The City.<br/>Thereafter my collaborative work with different theaters continued.<br/>Starting from 1967, I established close connections with a group of<br/>musicians, devoted to studying color-music, following Scriabin&apos;s<br/>theories on the subject. The group, situated in Kazan, was assembled<br/>under the name &quot;Prometheus&quot; and was led by musicologist Bulat<br/>Galeyev.<br/>I took part in all of the color-music festivals in Kazan with my<br/>electronic compositions and also wrote the music to the film Cosmic<br/>Sonata, produced by a film studio in Kazan. In 1968, I became<br/>acquainted with an actress from the Moscow Concert Association,<br/>Martha<br/>Vladimirovna Tsifrinovich, a famous puppet actress, who worked in the<br/>Obraztsov Theater and then started to work independently with dolls,<br/>which frequently recited monologues and performed musical numbers in<br/>her theatrical performances. She came to the Electronic Music in<br/>search for new musical means, and we established close creative<br/>connections with her and for a long time worked toge-ther<br/>collaboratively at the Moscow Concert Association, where we prepared<br/>a<br/>solo concert in two parts. We still collaborate with her up to now,<br/>though she does not act any more, still she has many theatrical<br/>projects. At that time I composed music to many miniature puppet<br/>shows<br/>where she performed, among which I could name Fruits of Upbringing,<br/>Variety Show 913, and The Frivolous Handkerchief. Finally our<br/>collaborative work resulted in a theatrical performance entitled The<br/>Fire of Hope after motifs of Pablo Picasso. It was presented by a<br/>whole large group from the Moscow Concert Association and in this<br/>production puppets were used, which were the size of a human being.<br/>The production was put on in February 1985, came off with a big<br/>success and for several years in a row was repeated in various<br/>concert<br/>venues. Recently it has been recreated by the Mytishchi Puppet<br/>Theater. After a certain period of time I was accepted into the<br/>Association of Electro-Acoustic Music, a branch of the Russian<br/>Compo-sers&apos; Union, since while working at Moscow University and doing<br/>research of constructed sound, I con-tinued my compositional<br/>activities. I kept up the ANS in a working and sounding condition, in<br/>addition I never lost contact and continued communicating with those<br/>people and composers with whom I was acquainted from the time of the<br/>Electronic Music Studio. The members of the Association of<br/>Electro-Accoustic Music were well acquainted with my music from<br/>previous years, so when I applied for mem-bership in the Association,<br/>they accepted me there at once without the least bit of delay. The<br/>very fact that I was accepted into the Association was very positive<br/>for me also in the sense that it turned out to be a certain<br/>mobilizing<br/>factor for composition of new pieces. Since the Association regularly<br/>partici-pates in the Moscow Autumn contemporary music festival as<br/>well<br/>as the Electronic Music Festival in Bourges, France, where it is<br/>mandatory to present a new electronic composition every year, so like<br/>all the other members of the Association, I do my best to accomplish<br/>this task, writing a composition at least once a year. Thank God that<br/>there is such an association in existence, where the music which is<br/>written could regularly be sounded. Now I am once again connected<br/>with<br/>a not very usual type of thea-ter, which is presented by a group of<br/>enthusiasts in the Central Actors&apos; Building. The group is directed by<br/>a very interesting artist and scenario writer, Anna Koleichuk, the<br/>daughter of the noteworthy archi-tect and designer, Vyacheslav<br/>Koleychuk, and she is assisted by a talented computer designer and<br/>ani-mator, Andrei Topunov and a wonderful dancer, Elena<br/>Lukyanchikova.<br/>They produce short multi-me-dia theatrical performances, where they<br/>always find a great amount of interesting and unusual solutions in<br/>the<br/>scenic, light-dynamic, graphic and plastic spheres in their<br/>theatralized musical numbers. Two such theatrical performances have<br/>already been presented with my music on the scene of the Chamber Hall<br/>of the Central Actors&apos; Building. They were both presented in the Fall<br/>of 1998: the first one was shown at the Alternativa Festival and the<br/>second - at the Moscow Autumn Festival. These theatrical pieces carry<br/>the titles of the musical compositions of mine, which were written<br/>independently, not espe-cially for the theatrical group, but which<br/>the<br/>artists subsequently utilized for their theatrical performan-ces. The<br/>first piece, written in the genre of musique concrete, is called<br/>Music<br/>of Wood and Metal, and the second piece, Confession, is written for<br/>female voice and an &quot;ovaloid.&quot; An ovaloid is a special, exo-tic kind<br/>of musical instrument, which was constructed by Vyacheslav Koleichuk.<br/>It consists of two big metallic discs, one having an oval shape and<br/>the second - a half-oval shape, which are connected to each other by<br/>one axis. The discs have a multitude of cracks of various depths,<br/>which form into thin plates. Each plate provides for a sound with a<br/>definite pitch. One could evoke sound from the sound from the plate<br/>by<br/>means of a string bow, a pluck or a strike of the mallet. The mallets<br/>used could be me-tal, wooden or glass ones. All of this creates a<br/>wide<br/>variety of timbres and dynamics of sound.</p></div>
