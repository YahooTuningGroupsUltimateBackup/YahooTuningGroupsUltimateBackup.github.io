You mean musical context?  It&apos;s not<br/>&gt; something harmonic entropy tries to model.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sorry if this was unclear, I meant the relative strengths of harmonics<br/>in each tone (assumed not to be inharmonic)... timbre, if you like.</p><p>The reason for mentioning this is that it has been shown to be very<br/>difficult to pick out pure intervals between sine waves. E.g. the<br/>relative consonance or dissonance of (say) 695c vs 700c should in<br/>reality depend strongly on the timbres used.</p><p>Clearly, the ranking according to &apos;roughness&apos; or beating will agree<br/>with the ranking by harmonic entropy, at least in the neighbourhood of<br/>a recognizable consonance.

Western ears are conditioned to recognise intervals which<br/>occur in Western music, and these intervals occur mainly because they<br/>approximate certain integer ratios, which makes them tunable via<br/>interaction of partials. The consonance or dissonance is usually<br/>registered via this interaction of partials (plus familiarity, or lack<br/>of it). If we remove the partials, our ears can still recognise<br/>intervals to some extent - but nowhere near so accurately.</p><p>The fact that we can&apos;t find pure fifths, etc., using sine wave tones<br/>shows that (relative) frequency sensation alone is nowhere near enough<br/>to account for our experiences of consonance and dissonance. I think<br/>it very unlikely that the brain is able to recognise integer ratios of<br/>frequency without further cues - i.e. partials.</p><p>Frequency is, crudely, distance along some part of the inner ear.<br/>Interval between pure tones is then related in some way to the<br/>distance between two points. Put this way, it is not surprising that<br/>we can&apos;t pick out integer ratios unaided.</p><p>On the last point: why should recognising a semitone be considered<br/>such a much more difficult problem (for a theory of interval<br/>recognition) than recognising a fifth? To sing a melody you need to do<br/>both with fair accuracy.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=68806 href="#68806">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2007 5:53:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Clearly, the ranking according to &apos;roughness&apos; or beating will<br/>&gt; agree with the ranking by harmonic entropy, at least in the<br/>&gt; neighbourhood of a recognizable consonance.

You can also use h.e. to model the<br/>ability of the timbre to evoke a single pitch by plugging its<br/>partials into a chordal version of harmonic entropy.</p><p>&gt; My suspicion is that h.e. is simply a mathematically elegant<br/>&gt; surrogate for what actually happens in the ear, i.e. the<br/>&gt; interaction of partials.</p><p>Yet another option would be to enter all the partials being<br/>heard at once into a chordal h.e. model.</p><p>Critical band roughness is only *one part* of consonance.<br/>Try comparing 4:56:7:9 with 1/(4:5:6:7;9) for example.</p><p>&gt; Western ears are conditioned to recognise intervals which<br/>&gt; occur in Western music,</p><p>This effect can (I believe) be overcome with training in a<br/>reasonable amount of time.</p><p>&gt; If we remove the partials, our ears can still recognise<br/>&gt; intervals to some extent - but nowhere near so accurately.</p><p>What do you think of this graph</p><p><a href="/harmonic_entropy">/harmonic_entropy</a></p><p>as a picture of the recognizability of a dyad played with<br/>sine tones?</p><p>&gt; The fact that we can&apos;t find pure fifths, etc., using sine wave<br/>&gt; tones shows that (relative) frequency sensation alone is nowhere<br/>&gt; near enough to account for our experiences of consonance and<br/>&gt; dissonance.</p><p>On the contrary, in the real world fifths are not often not<br/>tuned beatless by performers.  And partials do more than make<br/>accurate tuning possible via beating -- they provide more<br/>information to the brain&apos;s virtual pitch processor.</p><p>&gt; I think it very unlikely that the brain is able to recognise<br/>&gt; integer ratios of frequency without further cues - i.e. partials.</p><p>I can dig up some studies for you if you like.  In bats and<br/>cats, combination sensitive neurons in the inferior colliculus<br/>are tuned to JI intervals...</p><p>Have you ever tried tuning a pair of sine generators?  I<br/>didn&apos;t find it as hard as you seem to be saying.</p><p>&gt; Frequency is, crudely, distance along some part of the inner ear.</p><p>And counts of zero-crossings of waveforms on the auditory nerve.</p><p>&gt; On the last point: why should recognising a semitone be considered<br/>&gt; such a much more difficult problem (for a theory of interval<br/>&gt; recognition) than recognising a fifth?</p><p>To be more accurate, you&apos;re asking: Why should a &quot;semitone&quot; be<br/>harder to study than a 3:2?  The answer is, define what a<br/>semitone is, and then we can study it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
