I&apos;m not sure what<br/>the pitches are, quite high, in the<br/>second or third octave above middle c,<br/>as it is more like an impression of the<br/>sort of effect I&apos;m used to hearing when you<br/>have several fast beats simultaneously, and<br/>the feeling that with time, maybe with a longer clip,<br/>or listening to it a number of times, and<br/>listening quietly I could sort them all out.</p><p>But there is a slow one there at c above middle<br/>c that is fairly distinct from the others<br/>again in the first note.</p><p>There&apos;s an even slower one already at middle c<br/>itself at that point, that&apos;s about a couple of<br/>beats per second, at the same pitch<br/>as the one you get when the major third comes in,<br/>but even slower and much less pronounced.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Same one, not Setharised:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_un_seth.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_un_seth.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some slow large amplitude beats there in the chord,<br/>&gt; &gt; when the major third comes in, fairly smooth for the single note.</p><p>&gt; Honestly, I can&apos;t hear the beats here. Which is no surprise -- a<br/>&gt; major third would only beat if the n*5th partial of the lower note<br/>&gt; &gt; beats against the n*4th partial of the higher note. If you&apos;re using<br/>&gt; only partial #s 1, 2, 6, and 10, there&apos;s no opportunity for this to<br/>&gt; happen.</p><p>Listen carefully - the slow middle c for the major third is there again and more<br/>pronounced than in the clip before. Other ones as well.</p><p>&gt; &gt; though<br/>&gt; &gt; with really strong beats already in single notes, but these are<br/>&gt; &gt; really musical ones so I like it, like bell beats.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_Bessel_Seth.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_Bessel_Seth.mp3</a></p><p>&gt; Well, finally here&apos;s one where I hear beating when the major third<br/>&gt; comes in. Can you explain what this one is, how it&apos;s different from<br/>&gt; the one above, etc.? You say it&apos;s &quot;Seth&quot; (arized?) but somehow I<br/>&gt; think there must still be some just 5th partials in these<br/>&gt; timbres . . .</p><p>Yes it&apos;s metatimbres consisting of stacked Bessel functions so they will<br/>all have the complete harmonic series I&apos;d have thought.</p><p>Do you not hear the beating partial in the first note as well?<br/>Slow, bell like, only about one beat or so a second and quite<br/>pronounced. There is a higher simultaneous one too, a bit faster, maybe<br/>two or three times a second, and not so pronounced - a sort of polyrhythm<br/>effect as you often get with beats, I think it might be 2:3 or something.</p><p>It is a matter of listen carefully to individual pitches<br/>in the notes and hear which of those are beating.<br/>Listen to them as you would to separate instruments<br/>in an orchestra - then it becomes really clear if<br/>one is beating because that is all you are listening<br/>to at that point - just like listening to a flute player<br/>in an orchestra and hearing that he or she is playing<br/>a note with tremulo at a particular point.</p><p>There is little or no volume variation in the<br/>note as a whole, what there is would be<br/>a complex pattern of superimposed beats,<br/>not easily recognisable as beats at all,<br/>just a kind of a roughness. Listen for<br/>many simultaneous beats running with<br/>different rhythms at once, like Bell partials.</p><p>Then on the rest of the e-mail - yes they are metatimbres,<br/>using harmonic but very complex timbres superimposed.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=53502 href="#53502">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2004 9:06:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; HI Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_seth.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_seth.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can hear many simultaneous beats there but they are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; gentle (though fast) and it is quite smooth sounding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I find it hard to hear any beats in the individual timbres, and<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; notes of the chord are struck too far apart for me to hear whether<br/>&gt; the chord itself is producing any beating or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, unless it is beating with my computer fan or<br/>&gt; something, I&apos;ve been fooled like that before,<br/>&gt; but you would get that with a single<br/>&gt; partial and they wouldn&apos;t only come in<br/>&gt; when you stack them together, also I&apos;d hear<br/>&gt; them in the harmonic clips I posted aurely.<br/>&gt; So I think these are real!</p><p>One thing to keep in mind, Robert, is that combinational tones vary<br/>*nonlinearly* in loudness with the amplitude of the signal. They can<br/>be at negative dB values when I listen to them in the office, rise at<br/>a low-integer multiple (such as 2 or 3 or 4) of the dB of the input,<br/>and end up incredibly loud with two recorders playing ff in my ear.<br/>So the very same audio clips may exhibit audibly different<br/>combinational tones, and thus different patterns of beating --<br/>particularly if the beating doesn&apos;t arise directly from very close<br/>frequencies in the signal -- depending on the volume at which one<br/>listens.</p><p>Another important factor is the audio equipment. Only very high-end<br/>audio equipment can faithfully reproduce sound with no harmonic<br/>distortion. Harmonic distortion produces combinational tones of all<br/>orders.</p></div>
