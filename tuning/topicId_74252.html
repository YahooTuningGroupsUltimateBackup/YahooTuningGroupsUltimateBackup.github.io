For Werckmeister, the interval C-G<br/>could be &quot;1^&quot; meaning &apos;make it a bit flat&apos;. In TU this would become<br/>-180 --- 180 of what? Well, 180 of something many times smaller than<br/>you could possibly hear. The units could be 10 times larger without<br/>losing anything audible, which would make it easier both to write down<br/>(lose all those zeros!) and to read. TU are hyperinflation.</p><p>12 of these large numbers representing tiny intervals go into a<br/>circulating temperament, leading to a forest of zeros as here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/comparison.html">www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/comparison.html</a><br/>where I can&apos;t see anything which corresponds to the musical effect of<br/>the tunings - apart from, possibly, whether they have wolves or not.</p><p>Since Margo&apos;s synthesizer uses units of 1/1024 octave, I think this is<br/>a logical choice of unit for her to calculate in - &apos;Yamaha Unit&apos;? It<br/>has the nice feature that 20 of them are almost exactly a Pythagorean<br/>comma. Practically, your expected error on any desired interval is<br/>about 1/2000 octave; in order to avoid rounding errors you can<br/>calculate down to 0.1 YU.</p><p>The formula for a 7/6 is just 1024*log(7/6)/log(2), which gives 227.7<br/>YU. You can choose between 227 and 228 synth steps for the pure<br/>interval. If one chooses 599 steps as a &apos;pure&apos; fifth, three of them<br/>give a third of 251 YU, thus the total widening of the fifths for a<br/>pure 7/6 comes to 24 or 23 synth steps. Margo&apos;s choice of 5+6+6<br/>widening gives a total of 17, which is an error of 6.3 steps or about<br/>1/3 comma.</p><p>Now if you *really* want to do theoretical work - i.e. to be<br/>mathematically exact - why not use the exact values of intervals?<br/>Units always imply some approximation. Or at least use units which<br/>allow you to write down the sizes of intervals:  TU are only intended<br/>to measure the deviation from some pure 5-limit interval, which is<br/>very restrictive for general theory.</p><p>Anyway, about unequal tones. Here&apos;s how a (hypothetical)<br/>1/6-comma-like meantone harpsichord tuning can lead to a melody<br/>instrument using not only unequal semitones, but unequal tones - as<br/>implied by Galliard, if we think this feature of his theory was<br/>intended to have acoustic application.</p><p>Each fifth of the harpsichord is tempered by 2 &apos;Neidhardt units&apos;<br/>(actually 2 cents each). Then the fifths are about 349 NU, a pure<br/>fifth being 351 NU. A pure major third is then 193 NU. To complete our<br/>list of consonances, the minor third is 158 NU, giving sixths of 407<br/>and 442 NU.<br/>The major scale of the harpsichord is:<br/>C D98 E196 F251 G349 A447 B545 C600</p><p>&apos;Neidhardt units&apos; are the most economical way to write down these<br/>interval sizes (and those of most circulating temperaments) to the<br/>desired accuracy.</p><p>Now consider a bass viol which plays exactly in tune with this scale,<br/>and a violinist who makes pure intervals above the bass viol.<br/>(Consider the similarity in timbre and sustain.)<br/>Suppose that the viol plays the bass line in unison with the harpsichord:<br/>C B545 C A447 E196 D98 G349 C</p><p>and the violinist plays the scale C D E F G A B C above this bass.<br/>What pitches will the violinist ideally hit? I find the violin to play<br/>as follows:<br/>C D103 E193 F254 G354 A449 B542 C600</p><p>The tones and semitones are then:<br/>C-D 103<br/>D-E 90<br/>E-F 61<br/>F-G 100<br/>G-A 95<br/>A-B 93<br/>B-C 58<br/>Compare these to 9/8 (102 NU), 10/9 (91 TU), and 16/15 (56 NU).<br/>Even with a quarter-comma (3 NU) detuning fudge factor, the tones are<br/>definitely unequal!</p><p>With a 1/6-comma meantone tuned harpsichord, if the sustaining<br/>instruments strive to be as in-tune as possible (the viol in unison<br/>with the harpsichord, and the violin with the viol), u n e q u a l<br/>tones naturally occur in melody. Where does this leave the<br/>Chesnut/Haynes/Duffin/Lehman approved idea that 1/6-comma meantone was<br/>a standard of &apos;melodic purity&apos; - whatever that means? It is precisely<br/>in the melody that purity of intonation leads to significant<br/>deviations from meantone.</p><p>It would be interesting to repeat this exercise assuming various<br/>different regular harpsichord tunings and various different bass lines...<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2007 9:43:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Tom,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Since Margo&apos;s synthesizer uses units of 1/1024 octave,<br/>&gt; I think this is a logical choice of unit for her to<br/>&gt; calculate in - &apos;Yamaha Unit&apos;?</p><p>If you just came up with that on your own, it&apos;s an<br/>interesting coincidence, because i&apos;ve had this webpage<br/>online for several years, right down to the same<br/>abbreviation you used:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/y/yamaha-unit.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/y/yamaha-unit.aspx</a></p><p>The whole point of TU (at least as i know it, which<br/>is 1/720 pythagorean-comma) is to provide integers<br/>which can describe the size of various different<br/>temperaments.

It is precisely<br/>&gt; in the melody that purity of intonation leads to significant<br/>&gt; deviations from meantone.</p><p>Oh, come on.  Your example imposes a double standard upon different<br/>members of your hypothetical ensemble.  You&apos;re constraining your bass<br/>viol player to hit exact unisons with the harpsichord.  That&apos;s one<br/>standard.  But, you&apos;re compelling your violinist to IGNORE everything<br/>the harpsichordist&apos;s right hand is doing with chords, melodies, and/or<br/>any other doubling...instead of trying to match pitch with any of the<br/>exemplary notes therein. That&apos;s a second standard for your violinist.</p><p>Why not just flip it around, equally arbitrarily, and compel your<br/>violinist to play as well &quot;in tune&quot; as possible with the right-hand<br/>chords he&apos;s hearing from the harpsichord, and your bass viol player to<br/>supply whatever exact bass pitch sounds best under this?</p><p>Why not have both your string players adhere to the same standard as<br/>one another...either both ignoring the harpsichord, or both striving to<br/>match it?</p><p>And what about the violinist&apos;s line having melodic integrity all by<br/>itself, with evenly spaced steps, as at least some violinists would try<br/>to do if they&apos;re not obsessed with creating momentary just-intonation<br/>5:4, 4:3, 3:2, or 6:5 above some bass?</p><p>Your &quot;purity of intonation&quot; phrase here clearly means TO YOU that the<br/>guy should be striving for 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 6:5, etc over wherever the<br/>bass notes happen to be.  But, what if &quot;purity of intonation&quot; meant TO<br/>THOSE MUSICIANS that they&apos;re hitting the marks of the system standard<br/>(in this case 55-ET) dead-on, and ignoring such opportunities to do<br/>what you would wishfully compel them to do with vertical beatless<br/>consonances?</p><p>=====</p><p>Your problem gets worse if you go to other species of counterpoint,<br/>instead of note-against-note as in your example.  Try the species where<br/>your two lines are supposed to move in syncopation against one another,<br/>taking turns with motion.  Have your bass start on C, and have the<br/>treble leap from E to A and hold the A.  Then, have your bass move to D<br/>while that A is still being held; and over that D the treble comes down<br/>to G.  Under that G the bass now moves to E...and then have your treble<br/>leap up to C.  Is that C supposed to be anywhere near 2:1 from the bass<br/>line&apos;s initial C, or have their micro-adjustments for just intonation<br/>already screwed up things too badly in merely three bars of music?  If<br/>these players aren&apos;t leaping to hit marks (with or without any doubling<br/>from the harpsichord or any other fixed standard), and not changing<br/>their own pitch slightly while the other player moves, either, how do<br/>you reconcile this fantasy?</p><p>This same latter example, with the bass line playing Do-Re-Mi and the<br/>treble playing Mi-La-Sol-Do, reckoned in frequencies:</p><p>Give your bass Do an arbitrary starting frequency of 144 (easily<br/>divisible by lots of things).  The treble&apos;s Mi, if he&apos;s doing a 5:4, is<br/>then 180; and he leaps to La at 240 to make a pure 5:3 over the Do.<br/>Under that 240 the bass moves to Re at 160, so it&apos;s 3:2.  Over the 160<br/>the treble builds his Sol at 4:3 or 213.3_.  The bass player makes a<br/>6:5 Mi-Sol here, so he has to do 177.7_.  (Hey, this is already lower<br/>than the 180 that the other guy just played!)  And over the 177.7_, the<br/>treble builds an 8:5 up to a new Do at 284.4_.  And already within<br/>these three bars of music, the old Do was 144 and the new Do has sunk<br/>to 284.4_ instead of 288, which would have been a pure 2:1.  Why should<br/>music this simple need to have (already) two different pitches for Mi,<br/>and two for Do?</p><p>All this junk goes away if they&apos;d simply hit the PURE positions Do/Ut,<br/>Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, and La that the regular system has prescribed for<br/>them, where all four of the Ut-Re-Mi and Fa-Sol-La tones are the same<br/>size as one another.  Hence, its usefulness not only for pedagogy but<br/>also for practice.  And Fa-Ut, Ut-Sol, Sol-Re, Re-La, and La-Mi are all<br/>the same size as one another, too: slightly narrow from 3:2.  And Ut-Mi<br/>and Fa-La are the same size as one another: slightly wider than 5:4.<br/>Those &quot;impurities&quot; (in a different sense of &quot;purity&quot;!) are a small<br/>price to pay, in the trade-off that the musical passage can be as long<br/>as one likes and still end up at the same pitch level where it<br/>started.</p><p>All those pitches happen to match your (hypothetical) &quot;1/6-comma<br/>meantone tuned harpsichord&quot; exactly; fancy that.  Both the bass violist<br/>and violinist could stay right on pitch by simply hitting all the<br/>harpsichord&apos;s exemplary notes, and adhering to the same intonation<br/>standard as one another, too.  They&apos;re as in-tune as possible with the<br/>p u r i t y   o f   t h e   s t a n d a r d .</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
