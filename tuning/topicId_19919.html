Partch thought it important<br/>enough that he calculated several pages of 17 limit ratios (published<br/>posthumously in Enclosures 3.)  Of course, Partch never used 17-limit<br/>intervals in his compositions.</p><p>I have explored the 17th harmonic in my composition &quot;Trespass,&quot; a quartet for<br/>soprano and string trio.  The tuning is quite recognizable, and personable.<br/>There is possible chord function composition with it, and it does not sound<br/>like 12-tET.  Some have made suggestions that since Gallilei focused on the<br/>17th harmonic for finding his 99 cent semitone, that this would be an obvious<br/>character interval, but it is not.  The semitone being equal tempered or not<br/>is fairly insignificant regarding music matters.</p><p>My spin, though, is to use a just intonation variant which I have called<br/>&quot;harmonic 17.&quot; This signifies that all the intervals used contain ratios with<br/>a &quot;17&quot; multiple in either its numerator or denominator.  This way, every<br/>single note has &quot;seventeeness&quot; built in to it.</p><p>Re any description of a scale with a single 17-ratio in a sea of 7-limit,<br/>theoretically it would have to do with function.  If the &quot;pinion&quot; (foreign or<br/>outcast tone in Chinese music) is ornamental (even as a &quot;detuned&quot; note), then<br/>the case could me made that it was not functioning as a &quot;17-limit&quot;<br/>composition.  However, you could say it is a 7-limit scale with a single<br/>ratio of 17.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=19920 href="#19920">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2001 10:27:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave!<br/>    Helmholtz also used the 17th to explain the full diminished 7th<br/>chord (10-12-14-17). Personally 17 sounds pretty close to 12 et so much<br/>so that i haven&apos;t been that attracted to it. Possibly we hear the 12 ET<br/>semitone in certain situations as a 17 without labeling it that. But<br/>those who have put more time into it might object. I know that Poole<br/>feels the same as I.</p><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Dave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seventeeness is an interesting subject, I think.
