I&apos;ve cleaned up the worst of them. This version takes advantage of the chorus feature and the variety of string sounds in the GS mode of the VSC to end up with a more interesting string section than the AWE32&apos;s General MIDI.</p><p>Just for fun I tried sequencing the start of Stravinsky&apos;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; on the VSC (one of the more interesting things that&apos;s been done with 12-ET), since a couple of web sites for orchestral plugins have used this as an example.</p><p><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/sacre-vsc.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/sacre-vsc.mp3</a></p><p>The opening bassoon is pretty awful, I have to admit, even with a fairly low setting for the brightness. It almost seems like it makes a better English horn, and the English horn that follows makes a better bassoon. I could spend a bit more time balancing the parts as well.... But the brightness control allows me to make a distinction between the clarinets in A and the little D clarinet, and the VSC also has a fairly nice bass clarinet which is outside of the General MIDI bank (listen for it from 1:16 to 1:22). I also use the brightness control to make the alto flute a little darker than the regular flute.</p></div><h3><a id=60259 href="#60259">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2005 10:18:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Transformation-vsc.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Transformation-vsc.mp3</a></p><p>There seems to be a visible link to only one piece on<br/>~teamouse.</p></div><h3><a id=60370 href="#60370">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/9/2005 7:13:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Transformation-vsc.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/Transformation-vsc.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There seems to be a visible link to only one piece on<br/>&gt; ~teamouse.</p><p>That page is a placeholder; I haven&apos;t put together a web page to go there yet.
