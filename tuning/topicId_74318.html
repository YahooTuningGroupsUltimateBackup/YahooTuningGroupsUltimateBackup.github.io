As you know I have watched the sagittal<br/>project from its inception on the tuning-math list. I even joined<br/>in on the discussion now and then. I greatly admire what you and<br/>George have done, and I find sagittal to be remarkably clever, logical<br/>and thorough. It is also a very different approach to the whole<br/>problem of microtonal notation than the one I have taken.</p><p>While sagittal is based on comma relations, the megastaff is<br/>based on average perceptual limits. While I&apos;m certainly not<br/>going to stop anyone from using sagittal symbols on a megastaff,<br/>it doesn&apos;t make sense to me to make this the default standard for<br/>the system, as the two ways of thinking are very different in<br/>my opinion.</p><p>Part of my goal in creating the system was to use existing nomenclature<br/>and include as few foreign symbols and terminology as possible.<br/>Another goal was to make small pitch differences as intuitive and as<br/>simple as possible to notate and read. The only things anyone using<br/>the megastaff has to understand are a circle of 41 fifths, comma shifting,<br/>and JND fine tuning. The comma is a step of 41ET, which is adjusted<br/>by JNDs. Anyone can see which pitches are higher and lower at sight,<br/>without having to think about this or that comma shift, or even this or<br/>that accidental, since accidentals are now part of the position. The<br/>position + the inflection gives the pitch, tuned within 1/2 JND<br/>accuracy, so notes on the same position are easily differentiated by<br/>the small JND shifts. Position naming is totally flexible, since accidentals<br/>are not written, so correct spelling of harmonies is not even a notational<br/>issue anymore; it is a matter left only to theory, where it belongs.</p><p>Regarding the use of the sharp and flat symbols for JND tuning,<br/>these symbols are not being given new meanings which are contrary<br/>to the ingrained thinking of trained musicians, as you suggest. The<br/>terms &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; do not conventionally only refer to symbols;<br/>they are also used simply to mean &quot;a little higher&quot; and &quot;a little lower&quot;<br/>in pitch, as in &quot;that was a bit sharp&quot;. I simply took this existing usage<br/>and turned it into something useful for music notation. Trained<br/>musicians can easily see the logic, as there is already presently a<br/>distinction between &quot;accidental&quot; and &quot;inflection&quot;. Existing usage<br/>of the term accidental remains essentially the same, and the term<br/>inflection (presently having no precise meaning) is clarified with<br/>a precise meaning, making it useful. Positions are defined by<br/>accidentals; inflections fine tune positions in JNDs.</p><p>The system also provides a 1 to 1 correspondence with the keys of a<br/>Tonal Plexus keyboard, and the shapes and sizes of the keys are<br/>directly related to the system of JND inflections in the notation.</p><p>In sum, the megastaff is staying the way it is for good reasons.<br/>The only thing I have yet to explain is the notation of pure JI on<br/>the megastaff, which I have also fully developed. All in due time...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is great stuff.

To use the megastaff you hardly have to<br/>&gt; know anything. Just put notes in higher or lower positions and<br/>&gt; use your ear to fine tune them with inflections. It doesn&apos;t really<br/>&gt; require much knowledge of music theory either. I wanted<br/>&gt; something simple = high and low, tune it by ear, then ask the<br/>&gt; question: what did I do there? Then that analysis leads to a<br/>&gt; composition. This is an intuitive way of working. All the patterns<br/>&gt; of music theory can follow from something which was conceived<br/>&gt; without consulting theory at all. The theory is all there if I want it,<br/>&gt; but it isn&apos;t necessary to write the music. I can just draw pictures<br/>&gt; with notes and in the megastaff system, the notes actually sound<br/>&gt; the way they look.

There are specific difficulties with a few temperaments, but those are mainly ones that no one as far as I know has actually used (e.g., vishnu, luna). Most of the difficulties have been cleared up with the introduction of new flag combinations, so I&apos;m hoping that the latest updates will fix any remaining issues.</p><p>There are still reasons to prefer a specific notation for some tuning systems, as with Graham Breed&apos;s decimal notation for miracle temperament. It seems as if practically every note has a different accidental when miracle is written in Sagittal notation. But I think that if you work with numerous tuning systems, there&apos;s a distinct advantage to the idea of keeping the notation as consistent as possible.

You<br/>suggest some new symbols will be more appropriate. I strongly<br/>disagree. For trained musicians, using other symbols will not feel<br/>like writing and reading music. While the familiar symbols are there,<br/>it feels like music on the page when you write it, and it looks like<br/>music on the page when you read it. I don&apos;t think this is just because<br/>I learned to write music with sharps and flats. It&apos;s because the<br/>vast corpus of Western music has those symbols, and in my view<br/>that is a very important fact to consider. That that the symbols<br/>mean something differnt on a megastaff than they do on a traditional<br/>staff is in my opinion not as big a cognative dissonance as results<br/>from a whole new set of symbols. Other symbols just make the<br/>whole thing look too foreign and disconnected from history in my<br/>opinion, and I think any system requiring them has less of a chance<br/>of succeeding than a system which sticks to the traditional symbols,<br/>even using them in a new way, particularly when this new way makes<br/>sense according to existing musical semantics.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2007 6:41:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Sharp and flat = higher and lower.

How could<br/>you do this to us&quot;. Force us to have to _unlearn_ something we&apos;ve<br/>spent many valuable hours learning.</p><p>I note that this objection is entirely independent of any suggestions<br/>to use sagittal symbols. It&apos;s just about _not_ using symbols which<br/>already have a well established meaning as a pitch alteration, but of<br/>a very different magnitude. More like a GPD (greatest possible<br/>difference) than an JND.</p><p>&gt; Sagittal requires too much knowledge in my opinion.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to memorise it all. You can usually just look up the<br/>notation for whatever tuning you need it for. In this case you would<br/>only need the symbols for 1, 2 and 3 degrees of 205-ET. Admittedly not<br/>an EDO we have published a proposed standard for yet. These three<br/>could be  )|  )|(  ~|(  or the second one could be ~| instead of )|( .<br/>[Of course I mean the actual symbols in the sagittal font not these<br/>multi-character plain-text representations.] In either case, the<br/>number of JNDs corresponds to the number of curves in the arrow head<br/>and these symbols are visually smaller than conventional sharps and<br/>flats, while still being in the same &quot;style&quot;. Being up and down<br/>arrows, their direction of pitch alteration is obvious.</p><p>The symbols can be seen in a PDF of the character map spreadsheet here<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal2_character_map.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal2_character_map.pdf</a><br/>Scroll down to symbol 144 on page 5, the (conventional) natural, and<br/>you&apos;ll find the relevant symbols a little above and below it.</p><p>To _determine_ valid sagittal symbols for the degrees of an EDO<br/>requires a knowledge of the comma &quot;primary roles&quot; of the symbols and<br/>their relative popularity, as given in the spreadsheet. But this only<br/>has to be done once, and once it is done they just _become_ the<br/>symbols for those EDO degrees and the comma meanings can be forgotten,<br/>as we point out in the analogous case of the &quot;Trojan&quot; notation for<br/>fractional-step inflections from 12-equal, on page 16 of<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a></p><p>&gt; The symbols I use are all in a standard font set, plus<br/>&gt; standard musical symbols.</p><p>Good point. But I expect you could find some symbols that _look_ more<br/>like JND inflection symbols (by being small) even without going<br/>outside these sets.</p><p>I should also mention that you are also welcome to copy only those<br/>glyphs you need, from the sagittal font, and add them to your own<br/>font, or another font, as Oz has done. Or Oz or I could do it for you.</p><p>&gt; The only symbols which are slightly<br/>&gt; different are triple sharp and triple flat. An asterisk can be used<br/>&gt; as the triple sharp (as it is a stylized asterisk), and the triple<br/>&gt; flat can be made from a double and single in a standard<br/>&gt; music font set. The shifts are standard characters in standard<br/>&gt; font sets, they are + and html codes b   for positive<br/>&gt; shifts and ~ (b&#x8;&lt;) and &amp;conj; for the<br/>&gt; negatives. These resemble plus, double plus, minus and<br/>&gt; double minus (I could have used - and = for the negatives, but<br/>&gt; a wavy line is better since = means equals). I know the<br/>&gt; negatiives have other meanings, but most people aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; bothered by that since those symbols aren&apos;t used as often<br/>&gt; and they probably don&apos;t know what they mean anyway.<br/>&gt; The doubles are singles stacked vertically.</p><p>I have no great problem with any of those. Certainly none of them<br/>produce the cognitive dissonance produced by your current use of the<br/>conventional sharp and flat symbols.</p><p>&gt; This makes<br/>&gt; more sense than using sagittal symbols which are not in a<br/>&gt; standard font set and have too specific a meaning to use<br/>&gt; for my purposes.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what you mean by &quot;too specific a meaning to use for<br/>[your] purposes&quot;. Please explain. I seem to remember someone once<br/>criticising it for being too flexible. This was based on a<br/>misunderstanding, which is of course our fault for not explaining it<br/>better.</p><p>&gt; A shifted note is fine tuned by a JND<br/>&gt; inflection, so the shift can&apos;t be a sagittal<br/>&gt; symbol anyway since the size of the shift would require a<br/>&gt; different sagittal symbol to be correct.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m having trouble finding a reading of that sentence that<br/>makes sense to me. I understand that you have &quot;shifts&quot; of -2 -1 +1 +2<br/>degrees of 41-EDO and &quot;inflections&quot; of -3 -2 -1 +1 +2 +3 degrees of<br/>205-EDO (205 = 5 * 41). So the sagittal symbols for those numbers of<br/>degrees of those EDOs would be valid, wouldn&apos;t they?</p><p>Oh, wait a minute.</p><p>I just figured out that the sagittal symbols for 5 and 10 degrees of<br/>205-EDO could not be the same as those given in the sagittal paper for<br/>1 and 2 degrees of 41-EDO, since 205&apos;s best approximations of the<br/>5-comma and 11-diesis are 4 and 9 degrees respectively.</p><p>Is that what you are referring to?</p><p>So this _does_ make an interesting problem for sagittal notation of<br/>your shifts, which do not appear on the staff in any case, but it does<br/>not alter the validity of the proposed sagittal symbols for your<br/>inflections, which do appear on the staff.</p><p>&gt; The system is staying as it is, as I said, for good reasons.</p><p>You haven&apos;t yet convinced me (for one) that you have a good reason for<br/>expecting users to unlearn the standard meaning of the conventional<br/>sharp and flat. Not that you have to convince me of course.</p><p>&gt; Anyone who wants to use sagittal on it is welcome to it.</p><p>Thanks.

There<br/>is a simple explanation which should explain as to why<br/>this has been so. Thinking in terms of staff *positions* is<br/>the key, which is an orientation that is more practical than<br/>it is theoretical, but it stands up to both kinds of tests.</p><p>On a regular 5 line staff, a sharp, flat, double sharp or<br/>double flat shows that a given note is shifted in pitch up or<br/>down from its diatonic natural position. A note is not shifted<br/>in pitch into an adjacent position without a double inflection<br/>in most cases and a single inflection in some. While an<br/>inflected note might match the pitch of an inflected note<br/>in an adjacent position, an inflected note never shifts<br/>*past* an adjacent position.</p><p>Knowing that this how standard notation works in practice,<br/>intuition would suggest that a note written with an inflection<br/>in front of it on any musical staff of whatever<br/>size should not be shifted from its position past the next<br/>adjacent position, whatever the position means in terms<br/>of pitch; the furthest an inflected note could be expected<br/>to shift is into an adjacent position above or below it. It<br/>also stands to reason that an inflected note might reach the<br/>same pitch as another inflected note in an adjacent position,<br/>but it should never move past it.</p><p>This is exactly how things work on the megastaff.<br/>There are 6 times as many positions on a megastaff as<br/>on a traditional staff, since the megastaff does not show<br/>only positions for diatonic naturals, but shows positions for<br/>41ET. The positions also have no particular attachment to the<br/>diatonic naturals; that is, differences in pitch by position are<br/>uniform across the entire range of the staff.

Suffice it to say 41 is not a system chosen<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at random.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Certainly not random. I well understand its attractions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel that different symbols would create more of a barrier.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Clearly this is the core of our disagreement.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please consider that if these symbols would change, it would mean<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that writing music using my system would not entail using the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; standard symbols known to musicians world-wide, that is, sharps<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and flats, double sharps and double-flats, in the notation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Obviously. But why is that a problem? Many pieces of conventional<br/>&gt; &gt; sheetmusic do not include them either, except perhaps in the key<br/>&gt; &gt; signature. Do you think composers worry about this and think, &quot;I must<br/>&gt; &gt; get at least one accidental on every page or it won&apos;t _look_ like<br/>&gt; &gt; music&quot;? ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest some new symbols will be more appropriate. I strongly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; disagree. For trained musicians, using other symbols will not feel<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like writing and reading music. While the familiar symbols are there,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it feels like music on the page when you write it, and it looks like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music on the page when you read it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So are you saying that although it will have conventional clefs and<br/>&gt; &gt; bar lines and noteheads and notestems and flags and ties and rests and<br/>&gt; &gt; expression symbols and all the other paraphernalia of standard written<br/>&gt; &gt; music, it won&apos;t look like music unless it has some conventional sharp<br/>&gt; &gt; or flat symbols? Even though those symbols have been rendered<br/>&gt; &gt; unnecessary by the staff and it&apos;s just a kind of a trick putting them<br/>&gt; &gt; there because they don&apos;t mean what you think they mean?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Other symbols just make the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whole thing look too foreign and disconnected from history in my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So you don&apos;t think the megastaff itself looks very foreign and scary?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and I think any system requiring them has less of a chance<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of succeeding than a system which sticks to the traditional symbols,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; even using them in a new way,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Does this still apply if the meaning of the new symbols is incredibly<br/>&gt; &gt; easy to remember because of the form of the symbols (a real<br/>&gt; &gt; no-brainer), and the visual style of the symbols is reminiscent of<br/>&gt; &gt; conventional sharps and flats?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly when this new way makes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sense according to existing musical semantics.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But it doesn&apos;t make sense to me (or apparently Graham or Klaus).

If someone said that Ford<br/>wasn&apos;t objective, you are right that they would have no real possible<br/>defense.  Same in your case.

The human brain &gt;&gt;has a vast capacity for learning symbols.  It has more &gt;&gt;difficulty attaching conflicting meanings to existing &gt;&gt;symbols.  Learning both meantone and pythagorean tunings is &gt;&gt;a difficult enough task that two extra symbols should be &gt;&gt;neither here nor there.  (Unless you use a keyboard where &gt;&gt;the fingering&apos;s the same.)<br/>&gt; &gt; Aha! Yes. That&apos;s the thing. If it&apos;s a pretty much fixed pitch<br/>&gt; instrument that has been retuned, whether it be a keyboard or a<br/>&gt; refretted guitar or a re-tubed/valved brass instrument or a woodwind<br/>&gt; with different hole placements, you will want a different notation<br/>&gt; than you will if it&apos;s a flexible pitch instrument or you are otherwise<br/>&gt; bending the notes away from some underlying tuning.</p><p>Ideally we&apos;d use the same notation regardless of the instrument.</p><p>&gt; In both cases it is the underlying tuning of the instrument whose<br/>&gt; chain of fifths (assuming it has one) you want represented by naturals<br/>&gt; or nominals.</p><p>There are more cases than two.  For woodwinds I know (penny whistle, dizi, bawu?) I&apos;d want the nominals (maybe as a transposing instrument, maybe with numerical notation) to follow the chain of fifths and the accidentals to follow pitch size.  That&apos;s because the hole placement will sort out one diatonic scale but for accidentals I need to cover extra holes.  And more holes covered for a higher pitch.  Is there another way you can see this working?</p><p>For a refretted guitar as well, the physical design of the instrument biases towards pitch size for accidentals.  The important thing is to know which order C# and Db should be.</p><p>For a generalized keyboard I don&apos;t see it would do any harm to use the accidentals to remind the performer of the coarse tuning.</p><p>&gt; If the underlying tuning is either pythagorean or 12-equal we have<br/>&gt; standard sagittal solutions for those, to represent any tuning to the<br/>&gt; same kind of accuracy as Aaron&apos;s megastaff, namely to within about +-3<br/>&gt; cents. In the sagittal paper these are called Athenian (pythag-based)<br/>&gt; and Trojan (12-based).<br/>&gt; &gt; If you want to see what these notations for 19-EDO or 31-EDO look like<br/>&gt; you can use Scala. Simply generate the appropriate tuning wit EQUAL<br/>&gt; then SET NOTA SAJI1 or SET NOTA SA12R and take a look at the staff<br/>&gt; view. You may also want to SET SAG MIXED or SET SAG PURE.<br/>&gt; &gt; Let us know what you think of them. Too many different accidentals I&apos;m<br/>&gt; thinking.</p><p>I don&apos;t have Scala installed I&apos;m afraid.  But generally I think if you&apos;re going to notate pitch to that much precision it&apos;s better to use the megastaff or AFMM cents notation.  If the number of shafts is consistent I expect people can get used to it.  If musicians could train specifically in Sagittal for a number of years I expect they could handle all kinds of things and you&apos;d really better take the comments from them.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve changed the subject because I do have some other &gt;&gt;thoughts on this matter and maybe I&apos;ll set them out later. &gt;&gt;My own decimal notation is obviously an accident waiting to &gt;&gt;happen.<br/>&gt; &gt; Why do you say that? It seems the optimal notation for miracle<br/>&gt; temperaments.</p><p>It works for me for composition.  But then I always have the pitch structure in my head when I write.  There&apos;s a bit of confusion with 5-limit harmonies, because I know what they should look like on a normal staff.  With higher limits I only map them to the decimal staff so there&apos;s no problem.</p><p>The problem for musicians would be that, in detail, it looks confusingly similar to a normal staff.  As I write it the accidentals are different, but if you used sagittal for both cases that wouldn&apos;t be true any more.  I don&apos;t like Monz&apos;s 4 line staff because it doesn&apos;t work with normal manuscript paper (not such a big deal) and I&apos;m not a fan of leger lines.</p><p>My original solution was to make the first line bold.  I&apos;m thinking of different colours now, following the elements of the heavenly stems corresponding to each note:</p><p>1 wood, 3 fire, 5 earth, 7 metal, 9 water</p><p>There may even be a standard colour scheme.  This would mean the decimal staff would look distinctive in high-quality printing for musicians, but would still be readable in black and white.  It&apos;d also be easier to navigate leger lines.</p><p>A similar scheme would work for the traditional staff.  The obvious extention to an elements+2 scheme is</p><p>C moon, D fire, E water, F wood, G metal, A earth, B sun</p><p>The natural look for the treble clef would be</p><p>water, metal, sun, fire, wood</p><p>and the bass clef</p><p>metal, sun, fire, wood, earth</p><p>You can then vary the pattern for different key signatures (if you use them).  Maybe use plain black and white for Pythagorean tuning and colours for meantone.</p><p>I know that some colored staves have been suggested and didn&apos;t catch on.  Maybe this would work because the colours only add redundancy.</p><p>             Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2007 12:04:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;The human brain &gt;&gt;has a vast capacity for learning symbols.

Korean is extremely logical and<br/>consistent a written language, but it uses a whole new set of symbols<br/>than English.

But<br/>I&apos;m arguing, with this analogy, that in fact new context and meaning<br/>of the same symbols is more easily received than new sets of symbols.<br/> I too, would love to see actual studies on this of course.

That simply does not work for<br/>cases such as a double flat shifted down by a comma, and you end<br/>up using sandwiched symbols anyway. More importantly, what do<br/>you call the intervals? Once you start changing accidentals, you<br/>screw up intervals, and musicians trained to know standard<br/>intervals in music theory will not easily be able to to make sense<br/>of anything intervallic. Using shifts, this problem is avoided.</p><p>Shifts do not change the spelling of an interval, as Tartini<br/>accidentals would. Shifts provide consistent names for all intervals,<br/>which make logical sense to musicians who already know standard<br/>intervals with standard spellings which they learn to recognize<br/>through standard ear training.

I could not agree more.</p><p>I really believe that I am no neophobe at all!  And yet, I simply<br/>can&apos;t see getting used to all these systems that try to focus on<br/>combinations of different shifts and different commas etc etc.  I<br/>understand completely the origin of different commas, kleismas,<br/>schismas, etc etc, but I simply do not think about those things when<br/>I&apos;m dealing with MUSIC.</p><p>Pitch in music, the way I think of it, has two aspects that interact:<br/>melodic and harmonic.  Melodic pitch is based on two factors, 1.<br/>movement and by how much, and 2. memory (does this remind me of<br/>something I heard earlier?).</p><p>Neither of those two factors really needs the specificity of these<br/>complex new symbols.  I simply need to know if the pitch is raising or<br/>lowering and whether a little or a lot (and 20 cents and 22 cents are<br/>melodically identical).  And then I need to know if something is<br/>within a JND of a previous or otherwise specified pitch (the memory<br/>aspect).  That&apos;s it.</p><p>Now, harmonically, there is basically one main factor:  how much does<br/>the partials of this sound match up with versus beat against the<br/>partials of another concurrent sound?</p><p>It IS relevant whether it is off by 2 cents or no cents.  So in this<br/>case, more specificity is useful.  That&apos;s why I&apos;m interested in seeing<br/>MegaScore&apos;s JI adaptation.  But at any rate, the important thing<br/>harmonically is not exactly how far a pitch is from the previous or<br/>from the &quot;scale&quot; note, but how far from the other concurrent notes.</p><p>What is great about MegaScore is that it can clearly show melodic<br/>motion visually, with enough specificity for any melodic function.<br/>The JND concept is truly all that is needed for melodic music.  I have<br/>yet to see any notation system besides actual ratio numbers, lattices,<br/>or chord names that really shows harmonic music well.  Again, I&apos;m<br/>awaiting Aaron Hunt&apos;s explanation of MegaScore&apos;s JI aspect.  The<br/>reason I am interested in MegaScore anyway is that its JND<br/>specificity, while not enough to be harmonically precise, is close<br/>enough that almost no context will have more than one useful JI ratio<br/>within the range of the JND, so musicians could learn to harmonically<br/>adjust within the JND by ear without any ambiguity.</p><p>My point is that these loads of esoteric symbols that may specify<br/>pitch to the degree required by harmonic music are being suggested for<br/>a notation that is more essentially melodic.</p><p>I hope this is clear, I&apos;m finding it excessively hard to express these<br/>ideas in this context.

It has<br/>&gt; been more helpful that the notation tells me where the pitch is.I see<br/>&gt; no reason not incorporate an interval based system when appropiate to<br/>&gt; a generalized pattern when one reaches toward extreme limits.<br/>&gt; what instruments we use in the future will have more bearing on how<br/>&gt; all this is sorted out and the possibilty that such deversity will<br/>&gt; continue to exist for quite a ling time should not be very surprising.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is all a question of tab vs notation type issues.  The question<br/>is, do I tell you what to do, or am I describing the resulting sound.</p><p>My understanding is that for the most part composers are not always<br/>the best at writing specific instructions for different instruments.<br/>Composing and orchestrating and arranging and notating are all<br/>different activities to a degree.</p><p>It would seem we will always have use both for notations that show the<br/>resulting sound as well as for notations for what to physically do<br/>with an instrument.  However, with electronic music being a big part<br/>of our future, the latter will be less primary than it has been<br/>historically.  So notations that simply make logical sense of the<br/>basically limitless choices we have will be warranted.</p><p>Composers and theorists need a way to make sense of music without<br/>being bogged down by mechanical notations for instrumentalists.  And<br/>instrumentalists who are to get to any high degree of musicality need<br/>to understand the music too, not just how to make it.</p><p>Anyway, I guess your point is we shouldn&apos;t try to have one be-all<br/>system that asks all instrumentalists to play directly off the score<br/>without any specific mechanical notation.

The rest of the SCHOOLED guitarists are generally<br/>trained in a jazz approach that doesn&apos;t emphasize standard notation<br/>but certainly does not ignore it and any graduate from any university<br/>guitar program in the world is able to read standard notation<br/>somewhat, if not particularly well.  The vast majority of guitar<br/>methods and instructional material include standard notation, and the<br/>standard tab system for published music includes standard notation<br/>along with tab.</p><p>The idea that &quot;classical guitar&quot; as an oxymoron is ridiculous<br/>considering that a substantial amount of music for guitar was written<br/>during the end of what is considered the &quot;classical era&quot; and in the<br/>classical formal style.

If someone was using a 5-line staff for microtonal<br/>&gt; notation and using a different meaning of known symbols, it would be<br/>&gt; more of an issue because harder to tell which system we&apos;re in.</p><p>Right, that&apos;s why I&apos;m not much concerned about MegaScore either, and I changed the subject line to reflect this.</p><p>&gt; To continue with the language analogy, I believe confidently for<br/>&gt; myself and others that I&apos;ve observed that there is less resistance to<br/>&gt; learning to read Slovene (ignoring meaning, I just mean pronounce the<br/>&gt; words) than to reading Korean.  Korean is extremely logical and<br/>&gt; consistent a written language, but it uses a whole new set of symbols<br/>&gt; than English.  I think most English speakers more quickly learn<br/>&gt; Slovene, which uses mostly the same symbols, even though some change<br/>&gt; meaning, versus learning Korean which is a whole new set of symbols.</p><p>Ignoring meaning is ignoring precisely the hardest part of a language.  And I assume that most letters have very similar pronunciations between English and Slovene which helps for the initial learning.  This is for exactly the same reason that it&apos;d be nice to standardize on a set of microtonal accidentals.  Would you find it easy to learn a language with the usual 26 letters, but their meanings all jumbled up?</p><p>Also, there&apos;s a difference between speed of learning and efficiency of using a language.  Alphabets are great for fast learning when you already know or don&apos;t care about the meanings of words.  They&apos;re not maximally efficient once you learn them because many words have similar shapes.  (Not enough to stop them being used, of course, but enough to make dyslexia a problem.)  I also believe (but don&apos;t have a reference) that it&apos;s easier to forget words you learned with an alphabet compared to other systems.</p><p>&gt; I think that is basically our argument here.  You seem to suggest that<br/>&gt; the new symbols way is better than any change to known symbols.  But<br/>&gt; I&apos;m arguing, with this analogy, that in fact new context and meaning<br/>&gt; of the same symbols is more easily received than new sets of symbols.<br/>&gt;  I too, would love to see actual studies on this of course.  But just<br/>&gt; ask yourself, if you went on a long trip to Slovenia or to Korea,<br/>&gt; which one do you think you&apos;d more quickly and comfortably learn to<br/>&gt; pronounce by reading?</p><p>I&apos;m arguing that the brain finds it easier to learn new symbols than to give conflicting meanings to old symbols.  I believe there is a scientific basis for this but, alas, no reference.  I am still arguing for retaining existing symbols with their existing meanings.  That&apos;s why, for the difference it makes, I&apos;d rather uase Megascore with sagittal accidentals.  As far as it makes a difference (which is not much) I expect it to be easier to switch between the systems that way.</p><p>I&apos;m also arguing that it gets more confusing the more similar the contexts are.  The brain is good at distinguishing languages, probably as a direct result of natural selection.  The question is how much a new notation system counts as a new language or a variant of an old language.</p><p>The analogy here is between sagittal and the International Phonetic Alphabet.  The idea is to give each sound a unique symbol, consistent between languages.  Although I hope sagittal will be of more everyday use.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2007 8:48:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Ideally we&apos;d use the same notation regardless of the instrument.<br/>&gt; &gt; In what sense is that ideal?

However, of many classical guitar albums I have,<br/>I think only a small minority are completely transcriptions.  And many<br/>are purely guitar compositions.</p><p>A simple random <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> search for recordings of music by Fernando<br/>Sor (just one, but perhaps the most famous and popular of the guitar<br/>composers from around the turn of the 19th century) gave a result of<br/>371 CDs.  So, I understand that you haven&apos;t been exposed to his or any<br/>of his contemporaries&apos; compositions, or to the VAST number of<br/>compositions in the school of guitar that descended from him,<br/>including 20th century &quot;classical&quot; composers such as Heitor<br/>Villa-Lobos, Leo Brouwer, Jorge Morel, and hundreds of others.  As for<br/>not having heard from names you know, such as Paganini, his<br/>guitar-specific compositions are extremely challenging and so much<br/>less recorded and known compared to easier pieces.  Your personal<br/>ignorance of this whole world of music is not evidence of its<br/>insignificance.  I personally recommend a lot of this music as it<br/>includes some extremely fine composing.</p><p>Fact is, a decent portion of all published guitar music is in standard<br/>notation.  True, the majority of guitar playing is not notated or<br/>published at all.  Still, you wouldn&apos;t see huge catalogs of published<br/>standard notation guitar music if it wasn&apos;t selling...</p><p>I&apos;d really like to get back to the purpose of your original point.<br/>The question is whether it is practical to get an instrument like<br/>guitar to work with standard notation, hence the question of notation<br/>crossing over different instruments.<br/>I&apos;d like to hear your thoughts about my mentioning VOICE.

I<br/>need to clarify some things.</p><p>First off, I don&apos;t tend to like the entire alphabetical system, and<br/>I&apos;d rather think in terms of ratio and interval.  The MegaScore<br/>concept specifies those clearly enough and there is no inherent need<br/>for translating the notation into alphabetic names, so I was ignoring<br/>the #/b NAMING issues.  I guess they are still valid concerns, but I<br/>don&apos;t care personally much.</p><p>Then, the #/b symbols being used on the score for smaller intervals<br/>than usual made perfect sense to me because the staff itself shows<br/>smaller intervals than we&apos;re used to, so I thought it was sort of<br/>proportional.</p><p>I was a little wrong, because while the regular system # symbol means<br/>either up to the next position or half-way to the next position, in<br/>MegaScore, it take a double-# to get to half-way.</p><p>Still, it isn&apos;t THAT bad.  Basically here&apos;s what we have, roughly:</p><p>Regular system # = half-way to next position, except the odd diatonic<br/>half-step issue.</p><p>MegaScore, # = 1/4 way to next position, x = 1/2 way to next position,<br/>* = 3/4 to next position.</p><p>So, it isn&apos;t as comfortable an adjustment as I thought originally, but<br/>still, look at it the RELATIVE way, instead of an absolute number of<br/>cents and you can see that it isn&apos;t that confusing.  The way to think<br/>is that #/b means approaching the next staff position.</p><p>Sorry for my confusion, but does this make sense now?</p><p>It still does not address the alphabetic name issue, but what I like<br/>best about MegaScore is that Aaron Hunt can quote alphabetic names and<br/>pythagorean theory all day and I can still use MegaScore ignoring all<br/>of that.  MegaScore itself doesn&apos;t show alphabetic names, so I don&apos;t<br/>need to bother with them.

One reason is that the guitar has aquired a fifth and sixth string, so the tablature has become obsolete (and I can&apos;t quite make myself say that &quot;lute&quot; and &quot;present time&quot; is an oxymoron, so ...). And maybe, for mass produced editions, the publishers don&apos;t trust their customers to check their string tunings before tackling a piece in tablature.</p><p>Another thing is that tablature doesn&apos;t indicate duration. Which means all the modern editions had to come up with plausible note values and pauses; however, this is more of a problem with organ literature.</p><p>The biggest microtonal project has of course been done in an easy and obvious mix of instrument specific tablature, color codes and approximate staff notation, plus fractions instead of note names (I&apos;m counting the AFMM as many little projects, obviously). Proof that nobody needs neither megastaves nor sagittals nor anything else relating to post-Guidonean notation.</p><p>I was going to hold back until the Megastaff JI extensions were published, but here it is anyway: Here&apos;s one system that can depict melodic contour in an obvious way down to steps of 30 cents and there&apos;s another, nominal- and harmony-oriented one, that tries to do everything and is therefore a little complicated. Megastaff loses its visual advantage beyond 41-ET; Sagittal using the Megastaff can get rid of its coarser accidentals. The obvious idea is to combine the two.</p><p>Reintroducing these &quot;coarse accidentals&quot; can give you intermediate staff sizes. i.e. you may save on paper if have to learn more sagittal - and I&apos;m sure real life will have to settle on a comprise, maybe several, between ease of reading sizewise (and not gettign distracted turning pages) and ease of reading comprehensionwise. Sagittal can make the megastaff idea so much more flexible, and megastaff can put training wheels on sagittal (an image of Hermes on a monocycle comes to mind). I know if I have to notate something microtonal again, I&apos;ll use some mix.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2007 7:14:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry for all my confusion, what I was saying is that there is one<br/>&quot;natural&quot; staff position, and 4 in-between positions that require<br/>extra symbols.</p><p>Sorry I got it confused at first though.

And I&apos;m still waiting for Dave and Graham to explain<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;how the decimal number system isn&apos;t broken.<br/>&gt; &gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Roman numerals make arithmetic hard.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If that&apos;s true, it must be because context-switching is cheaper<br/>&gt; than not.</p><p>There are different levels of context switch.  I&apos;ll put them in a hierarchy:</p><p>1) Unconscious pattern matching</p><p>2) Different languages</p><p>3) Different modes of operation</p><p>4) Different tasks</p><p>In order to recognize symbols you need to do (1).  In many cases strings of digits are recognized this way.  As are words, of course, and you could have asked how we could possibly read English fluently.  It&apos;s a very difficult task after all and not one we&apos;ve had time to evolve for.</p><p>Ideally, when you become expert in a notation it should all be handled by level (1).  That&apos;s why I&apos;m suggesting accidental symbols shouldn&apos;t be re-used to identify different sizes.  Also why I&apos;m trying to make different staves look different -- so that a given note at a given position on a given staff has a unique appearance.</p><p>Shifts between languages are clearly done very quickly. Bilingual people will naturally switch between languages mid-sentence, with correct pronunciation even where the two language use different sounds.  If it&apos;s possible for different notations and tunings to be recognized as different languages then I&apos;d expect that to be very efficient.  Maybe Megascore versus a normal staff will do this.  I don&apos;t expect it to work for different Sagittal subsets because there are too many of them.</p><p>Modes of operation are generally artificial.  They can be confusing and are discouraged in interface design.  It&apos;s probably inevitable that different microtonal notations will fall into this region.  Hence we need to follow interface design rules and provide a clear visual clue that you&apos;re in a different mode, and make sure that mistakes caused by applying rules to the wrong mode are not fatal.</p><p>Switching between tasks is expensive, but focusing attention on a specific task is efficient.  Playing different pieces or different instruments fall into this category.  So musicians can be expected to use different notations for different pieces.  However, certain abstractions will be shared between tasks.  Switching to an obviously different notation will work but re-interpreting symbols in a subtly different way will be difficult.  I&apos;d also expect switching notations within a piece to be very difficult, unless they&apos;re recognized as distinct languages.</p><p>Now, you say you really want to know about decimal place notation, so I&apos;ll try and explain that.</p><p>Firstly, as Dave says, place arithmetic is very efficient. That works because operations on digits are the same regardless of their position.  You learn arithmetic by learning rules of operations on digits, and then applying rules on combining digits.</p><p>Learning these rules is harder with Roman numerals because you have to keep learning the same rules for different symbols.  Sexagesimal is good for fractions but means you have to learn a lot more rules for operating on digits (100 for pairs of decimal digits, 3600 for pairs of sexagesimal digits, ignoring symmetry).  In both cases the cost is in the number of rules you have to remember, not the number of symbols.  Decimal place notation gives the best mapping between symbols and concepts.</p><p>The second way we can understand decimal numbers is that we remember basic patterns, which is very similar to remembering new symbols.  (And complex symbol sets are usually built out of smaller symbols anyway.)  Your example of 11 is clearly in this category.  I sound it out as &quot;eleven&quot; without a moment&apos;s thought.  So it&apos;s recognized as a word.  I know that &#x5341;&#x4E00; refers to the same number but I have to consciously translate it into English.</p><p>Other patterns like small numbers, round numbers, &quot;10\d&quot; as &quot;hundred and \d&quot; and so on are recognized a basic patterns.   Reading arbitrary large numbers is difficult and often avoided.  How often to you skip over numbers when reading a text?  Often the alternative is to stop and transate it into words.  That requires a context shift from your usual, intuitive recognition of words.</p><p>We separate digits into groups of 3 to help pattern recognition (and provide a link to spoken language).  Large numbers are often written with &quot;m&quot; for million, or equivalents in other languages.  SI units come with standard prefixes so that you don&apos;t need numbers over a thousand. Scientific notation places only one digit to the left of the decimal point.  (Digits to the right of the decimal point are easier to ignore.)  Phone numbers and the like are read as a string of digits, not a big number.</p><p>I have a copy of the &quot;Primary Framework for literacy and mathamatics&quot; published by some branch of the UK government and available on the web somewhere.  (Sorry for not being more specific -- I downloaded the PDF a few weeks back.)  So I can outline the way they expect children to learn mathematics.  (Note that the page numbers are off by one between the document and the PDF so I&apos;ll probably mix them up.)</p><p>There&apos;s a brief overview pp.40-41.  That includes the telling sentence &quot;A good knowledge of numbers or a &apos;feel&apos; for numbers is the product of structured practice and repetition.&quot;  That tells you that it&apos;s being pushed into unconscious pattern recognition, and that it isn&apos;t an easy skill to learn.</p><p>There&apos;s then a three point list.  The first is very relevant:</p><p>&quot;- recall key number facts instantly &shy; for example, all addition and subtraction facts for<br/>each number to at least 10 (Year 2), sums and differences of multiples of 10 (Year 3) and<br/>multiplication facts up to 10 &times; 10 (Year 4);&quot;</p><p>So the first thing is to work on individual digits, then the &quot;\d0&quot; pattern, then multiplication of individual digits. (10 here qualifies as an honorary single digit.)  They&apos;re also expected to add single digits to multiples of 10 at Year 1 and &quot;partition two-digit numbers in different ways including into multiples of ten and one and add the tens and ones separately and then recombine (Year 2)&quot;.  So they learn the place context in Year 2 so that they can work with one and two digit numbers in Year 3.  At this point they still haven&apos;t progressed to three digits!</p><p>There&apos;s a table on pp.42-43 showing goals for each year. Year 1 is all 2 digits (usually starting with single digits or multiples of 10).  Year 2 introduces more operations, but nothing about the sizes of the numbers.  Year 3 expects multiplication and division of 2 digit numbers as well as introducing addition and subtraction of 3 digit numbers.  So it takes three years to get to three digits!  Year 4 is still 2 and 3 digits for whole numbers, but also introduces two decimal places for currency.  It&apos;s only at Year 5 that they&apos;re expected to efficiently multiply and divide by powers of 10.  Also in Year 5 they add and subtract with up to two decimal places.  Much of this requires written methods, of course.</p><p>Summarizing this, it takes about five years for children to understand the subtlety of decimal place arithmetic.  And along the way they learn rules for single digit operations and learn simple patterns for small and round numbers.</p><p>At the bottom of page 43 it explicitly says that you have to learn rules for single digits to &quot;add successfully&quot;.</p><p>On page 45 it says you need to remember facts for numbers up to 20 to do efficient subtraction.  Probably this means all numbers up to 20 are recognized as words.</p><p>Page 48 talks about facts for numbers up to 10 and rules for multiples of 10 for successful multiplication.</p><p>The rules for division are more complicated.  They&apos;re on pp.51-52 and rely more on explicit knowledge of the place system.</p><p>I hope that answers your question :-)</p><p>&gt;&gt;Sure humans can extract context-dependent meaning, but it isn&apos;t cost<br/>&gt;&gt;free and has to be weighed against lots of other perceptual and<br/>&gt;&gt;cognitive costs.<br/>&gt; &gt; Context switching is fundamental to human memory, in the way<br/>&gt; cortex works (see for instance Jeff Hawkins).  There&apos;s nothing<br/>&gt; cheaper.</p><p>I belive switching between complex tasks takes around 10 seconds.  Resolving ambiguous contexts within a task may be faster, but if it requires any conscious intervention it&apos;s too slow for reading music.</p><p>                Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2007 9:46:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; I still don&apos;t think we&apos;re communicating.

There are so many other social factors at<br/>work.  Technology, recording, those are the main killers of notation,<br/>because we now have other ways to remember or learn music.  Nearly all<br/>instruments have had a degree of decrease in notation use thanks to<br/>recording and other technology.<br/>My point in proving substantial notation use in the guitar world was<br/>to show that, acknowledging issues about guitar notation, we cannot<br/>assume that standard notation is guitar incompatible.  It simply isn&apos;t<br/>true.  And no percent, including 100, of guitarist playing being<br/>non-notation based proves that completely, it is only one piece of<br/>evidence.</p><p>The fact that I can pick up all sorts of standard notation and play it<br/>on my guitar is proof enough that it IS compatible.</p><p>Carl, you still never addressed my voice analogy really.  Most singers<br/>do not read.  That does not prove incompatibility with notation.</p><p>The real point is that we&apos;re trying to identify the purpose or<br/>supposed need of notation, and these examples DO prove that notation<br/>is not absolutely necessary for performance or for composition.  So<br/>the question is, what DO we need notation for?  OR even do we at all?<br/>Answering this question allows us to evaluate the importance of<br/>notational decisions.

But there are not 5 JNDs between positions, there are 5<br/>&gt; &gt; TOTAL.  Hence 4 that are between positions.  What is new is the<br/>&gt; &gt; elimination of enharmonic symbols, something that is a major<br/>&gt; &gt; improvement in my mind.  So instead of sharps and flats overlapping,<br/>&gt; &gt; the sharps are raising up from the lower note, and the flats come down<br/>&gt; &gt; from the upper one.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Think about it this way, let&apos;s say  you took regular staff and said<br/>&gt; &gt; that you simply wanted to split C to D to have two in-betweens instead<br/>&gt; &gt; of one, you make the lower one C# and the upper one Db, any complaints<br/>&gt; &gt; about that?  Then say you wanted another two notes, each between C and<br/>&gt; &gt; C# and between Db and D.  At that point if we treat the symbols as a<br/>&gt; &gt; generally absolute amount, you might want to say C-half-#, and C#.<br/>&gt; &gt; But if we treat the symbols as moving to the next degree, then we have<br/>&gt; &gt; as Aaron Hunt chose, C# and CX, Dbb, Db.  As much as this isn&apos;t the<br/>&gt; &gt; way you were used to thinking, double-sharps and double-flats are so<br/>&gt; &gt; rare in standard notation that I don&apos;t think there&apos;s comfort with them<br/>&gt; &gt; among most musicians really.  I think it is just as likely for a<br/>&gt; &gt; musician reading standard notation to see C# and think &quot;the next note<br/>&gt; &gt; just after C&quot; as to think &quot;in between C and D.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the end, of course it is a departure from standard, but clearly the<br/>&gt; &gt; whole thing is.

You could have the spacing between staff lines based on the intervals in your basic scale. Each notation system would have to be learned individually, but similar problems exist with applying a singla notation system (HEWM, Sagittal, or whatever) to a temperament or to a scale that doesn&apos;t correspond with JI. Still, even basic skills such as recognizing intervals would have to be relearned.</p><p>One of the things I like about the compound-nominal system, or the equivalent system with differently shaped note heads, is that you can easily see which notes are the basic scale of the tuning system, and thus have a pretty good idea which tuning system you&apos;re dealing with. You can get a pretty good idea of the size of intervals, but they still need to be learned for each notation system. A D-major triad in my notation for lemba temperament is D F^ )!!(A^.</p><p>With a more standard Sagittal notation, on the other hand, at least some of the basic intervals will be recognizable -- you can write D F||\ A for a D major triad. You do run into comma issues with any temperament, but that&apos;s the nature of temperament. Start with a D F||\ A C!) tetrad in lemba -- you can go down a major third from D to B!!/, then down a fifth to E!!/, or you can go up a major third from C!) to E\!). But E!!/ and E\!) are the same pitch in lemba. So you can either pick one and stick with it, or change the spelling of the note based on context.</p><p>On the whole, my current thinking is that the advantages of a consistent Sagittal notation for most temperaments outweighs the difficulty of the comma issues. But for a performer, having to learn a different pitch for every note in every different tuning system would be a huge mess. So it&apos;ll probably end up being necessary to use cents notation or something similar to remind the performer what pitch to use.</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2007 3:22:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Sorry I&apos;m late to this reply, but I just wanted to say I actually<br/>&gt; agree.

It is not anywhere on the score itself.<br/>We don&apos;t need to use letter names at all to use MegaScore.  Hence, the<br/>score itself only uses the symbols for JND movements, and only in the<br/>logical way I describe above.</p><p>&gt; So in this case it uses the same generalisation that sagittal uses,<br/>&gt; namely that Bb:F and F#:B are perfect fifths. This is the same<br/>&gt; generalisation that has been used throughout western history as<br/>&gt; tunings changed between Pythagorean, meantone and 12-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Megascore does _not_ use # when the pitch is changed by a comma as you<br/>&gt; suggest above. It uses a plus sign + which it calls &quot;super&quot;.<br/>&gt; See <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/megastaff/shifts.html">http://www.h-pi.com/megastaff/shifts.html</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>Once again, the system does not actually really need or include these AT<br/>ALL.  They are included in Aaron Hunt&apos;s suggested naming for the symbols<br/>on the staff.  I myself, may or may not choose to think about those<br/>names.  I could just as easily think in terms of &quot;thirds&quot; or in terms of<br/>ratios or cents.  Or I could use a whole new set of names that includes<br/>more letters of the alphabet.</p><p>You could go ahead and use whatever names you want.  MegaScore itself<br/>does not show these symbols on the score.</p><p>&gt; So we&apos;re still struggling to find _any_ kind of consistency between<br/>&gt; the common use of sharp and both of its different uses in Megascore,<br/>&gt; other than the crude fact that it always refers to some kind of<br/>&gt; raising of pitch.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Again, the score itself uses the symbols only ONE single consistent way,<br/>to show a movement to the very next available notated pitch.<br/>I think a good amount of your confusion (mine too originally) comes from<br/>issues in the way Aaron Hunt explained MegaScore.  He was attempting to<br/>justify the system by explaining its pythagorean and alphabetic roots in<br/>theory.  He went ahead and showed you where you would put these letter<br/>names on the staff, and he showed a suggested naming for notes in<br/>between.  But none of these things are actually on the staff!  The<br/>symbols that actually go on the staff are completely logical and<br/>consistent.</p><p>I will consider thinking about the names as Aaron H suggests and try not<br/>to be close-minded, but as far as I&apos;m concerned, my desire is to use<br/>MegaScore to completely get away from the confusion of these alphabetic<br/>names.  And it should work, because there is no required connection.  I<br/>might as well use Do Re Mi and add extra names like Du and Ru instead of<br/>the awful alphabet system.  All of that is independent of the MegaScore<br/>staff.</p><p>Hope that helps clarify.  Do go review his pages again if you doubt what<br/>I&apos;m saying.  My position is I have criticism of Aaron Hunt&apos;s<br/>explanations and presentation.  But MegaScore as I&apos;ve seen so far is<br/>fine.</p><p>In Harmony,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2007 4:44:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave, I hope I can try to clarify, and I hope my own initial<br/>misunderstanding was not part of the confusion...</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clearly there are 5 JNDs between staff positions as 205 = 41 * 5.

But the reason I still like MegaScore currently is because I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see the signs as having conflicting meanings.  I see # as<br/>&gt; meaning pitch is raised to next note, and because I never learned<br/>&gt; sagital, I never identified a particular amount of raising with the<br/>&gt; symbol #, and instead thought of the amount as a result of the tuning<br/>&gt; being used.  Hence, when using 205ET, # is a tiny JND, when using<br/>&gt; 41ET, # is a comma, when using 12ET, # is a traditional half-step, etc<br/>&gt; etc.  There&apos;s no reason in my mind to think of that symbol as a<br/>&gt; particular amount, it just means, going sharp.  And so then double-#<br/>&gt; means I did that twice.  Isn&apos;t that totally logical?</p><p>It&apos;s entirely logical, but I think it&apos;d be destructive in practice.  For a performer, a # symbol is a message that tells you to raise the note by a certain amount.  It&apos;s not always the same amount, and a microtonal notation can still build in some wiggle room, but there&apos;s an automatic response between seeing a note with a certain accidental and making the action required to produce that note.  Changing the size of the shift for the same symbol screws with that learned response.  It&apos;s better to have shift symbols map to consistent sizes between systems.</p><p>You can also use those symbols in tablature and numerical notation where there isn&apos;t a distinctive staff to provide context.  I hope the different staffs would be distinctive ;-)</p><p>This wouldn&apos;t be such a problem for MegaScore.  The score&apos;s sufficiently different, visually and functionally, from the usual staff that performers would learn to distinguish the new context.

These are important for the initial learning, and also for the notation as an illustration of theoretical ideas.  I think MegaScore is extremely good on this latter point.  It shows you the pitch contours and relative sizes of intervals (because it&apos;s basically an x-y plot) and also anchors them to the familiar staff.  So in this case the logic arguments will help readers understand it.  But still, I think casual readers would be able to get what they want from sagittal accidentals (because they&apos;re arrows).</p><p>&gt; But the &quot;unlearning original meaning&quot; of the # symbol isn&apos;t an issue<br/>&gt; if the WAY the person originally learned it was to mean &quot;the next<br/>&gt; higher note in the system.&quot;  I&apos;m arguing not just that such an idea is<br/>&gt; logical, but that I myself may have always thought of it mostly that<br/>&gt; way throughout my formal education, rather than as an amount of<br/>&gt; change.

They simply associate<br/>&gt; mechanical actions with the symbols, almost in the style of a tablature.<br/>&gt; Hence, none of those instrumentalists would be able to make any useful<br/>&gt; sense of any new system like MegaScore whatsoever.  They would<br/>&gt; basically have to learn a totally new way of thinking no matter what.<br/>&gt;  So concern for the &quot;amount&quot; of a sharp isn&apos;t even relevant to such a<br/>&gt; person.  They will have to learn a bit of theory just to understand<br/>&gt; the existence of the concepts shown in MegaScore, and along with that<br/>&gt; theory, they will probably be revising all sorts of previous<br/>&gt; conceptions they originally learned.<br/>&gt; I guess I&apos;m agreeing with you but saying that regardless of the<br/>&gt; notation issue, those people with the mindset like the hypothetical<br/>&gt; flute player will need to kind of start over no matter what.  It isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; bias in the notation requiring that, but bigger issues beyond that.</p><p>Anybody using numerical notation (and there are a lot, if not in your neighborhood) will need to know scales.  And even with staff notation they need to respond to key signatures.  But yes, it&apos;s mostly a question of starting over, and so not a big deal that there&apos;s a little inconsistency.</p><p>&gt; Right, so how would the issues of logic here be a problem?  If they<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t thinking logically, but by rote, in the first place... well,<br/>&gt; they can either learn the new system by rote, or they can see it<br/>&gt; logically the way I do.  It would be silly to try to make the logic of<br/>&gt; a system adapt to someone who is taking a rote rather than logical<br/>&gt; approach.  The logic aspect should try to fit those who might already<br/>&gt; be thinking logically. The problem I foresee is that the MegaScore has a note that you identify with, for example, C.  The structure of the staff points to it being C.  And the theory behind it is that this note really is C -- not an arbitrary note that happens to have the same pitch.  So the flute player learns to use the same fingering and so on for this new C as for the old C.  Then, there&apos;s an accidental which looks like a sharp, and is designed to look like a sharp.  So the intuitive action associated with a C with a sharp in front of it is to play it as C sharp.  But in fact it should be played almost identically to C.  That&apos;s where the problem would arise.  Logic has to overrule intuition until the rote learning takes effect.</p><p>&gt; Honestly, I&apos;m thinking of the MegaStaff for myself to be used for pure<br/>&gt; composition, synth stuff, along with the associated keyboard, and for<br/>&gt; vocals and other fretless instruments.  I&apos;m not thinking of relating<br/>&gt; it in any way to any fixed pitch instruments, even those with the<br/>&gt; ability to bend sharp or flat.  It doesn&apos;t seem practical for that in<br/>&gt; my mind.  I&apos;m not thinking about how to notate for performers who<br/>&gt; would actually play off the score, but just how to visually clearly<br/>&gt; express the musical idea and composition.  I&apos;ll leave it to tablature<br/>&gt; and finger-charts and other rote instrument notations to indicate how<br/>&gt; to play.  This all gets at a lot of discussions recently had.  It<br/>&gt; really comes down to what is the purpose.  If any guitar would ever<br/>&gt; play off MegaScore, it would only be a fretless one, and I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; even then that I&apos;d use it to read from and play like a traditional<br/>&gt; score.  Besides everything else, it is too big to show enough on a<br/>&gt; page.  But it is good for conceptualizing and composing and teaching...</p><p>I think MegaScore would work very well for a lot of instrumentalists.  It&apos;s distinctively different to a conventional staff while retaining enough landmarks to get a learner oriented.  Each note is distinct, so it&apos;s suitable for rote learning.  A lot of mistakes will result in a note only slightly off.  If you want to treat each note within a JND equally it may well be the best notation.</p><p>It might even work for a guitar.  Think of an instrument with 41 frets per octave.  You can use the staff position to tell you the fret and the accidentals (which would all have to indication sharpening) for string bending.  I think 41 is on the borderline of what will work for a guitar.</p><p>The real problems I expect with MegaScore are not to do with the accidentals.  The most obvious and probably critical one is the size of the score.  So it comes down to whether people want to devote that much more space for the sake of better pitch discrimination.  Another problem may be that performers can&apos;t distinguish neighboring staff positions clearly enough.  I don&apos;t expect that&apos;ll matter but only empirical evidence will show it.</p><p>The first advantage of sagittal notation is that it&apos;s simple for simple scales.  So if you only want 12 notes you only have to learn 12 notes.  That&apos;s an advantage for progressive rote learning -- MegaScore only makes sense once you&apos;ve got 41 under your belt.  It also means you don&apos;t need to devote any more space on the page for simple but different scales.</p><p>Paradoxically, sagittal may also be the optimum notation for expert performers.  Athenian sagittal is obviously horribly complex for newbies, and takes longer to get the hang of than MegaScore or the AFMM notation.  But if you&apos;re rote learning pitches it&apos;s not a big deal to rote learn the symbols as well.  The result is that different notes are clearly distinct, and the visual clues are all in the immediate vicinity of the note -- no need to navigate a large staff or look to the top for the cents.  It may make no measurable difference or it may be the decisive feature.</p><p>Speculation quickly becomes pointless.  Sagittal and MegaScore are both doing different things and optimal within their design goals.  I&apos;d like to see good studies comparing them or at least feedback from a large number of musicians with extensive training in both systems.  The pessimist in me says this will never happen.  Probably an inferior system will take over because some influential musicans start using it without thinking the issues through.  That&apos;s the way it usually goes.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2007 4:11:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;Roman numerals can&apos;t be that bad or they wouldn&apos;t have &gt;&gt;lasted as long.

The context is clearly different from its normal use as a pitch indicator so there is no confusion. The symbols # and  b are easier for musicians to read as increments than e.g. ^ v etc.</p><p>I&apos;ve not had any complaints from users of the software.</p><p>In other places such as the chord progression player, then the #s and bs are used in their normal sense to show the amount of the pitch adjustment. I&apos;ll also be adding in Sagittal some time after the next release and for that, naturally, the accidentals will be used to indicate the amount of the pitch adjustment.</p><p>Another use of them is the scordatura score. There the notation is used as a way to tell the musician where to place their fingers to play the notes not as a pitch indication. They work because of the trained response of eye to fingers. Then  the  ear can be used to fine tune once one has got to the approximate pitch in that way.</p><p>So in the same way - if reading a keyboard score for instance, then you can use the accidentals just as an indication of which key to press on the keyboard - in that case there is no distinction of #s and bs, and the score is shown just like any 12 t score, but with instructions to the user about how to tune each note - which need not even tune the notes as shown on the score to anywhere near the usual pitches. One can read such a score very easily even if the pitches played are far away from the usual pitches - even if the usual &quot;Octave&quot; on the score is retuned to a 3/2 or 3/1 or whatever, it doesn&apos;t matter as all that is needed is the usual eye / hand coordination to read the score and a willingness to  accept that the notes that result will sound differently pitched from the ones you usually get.</p><p>If one had access to a keyboard with split keys that could be retuned arbitrarily in the same way one could use a scordatura score with distinctions of flats / sharps, or fine shades of accidentals etc - again the accidentals would just show you which keys to press, not used as an indication of the pitches expected at all.</p><p>For keyboard players then a scordatura score showing which fingers to use for the notes is far easier to read than a score that shows the pitches to play - in  the case where the keyboard is to be retuned in some unusual fashion (such as non octave or whatever) - basically there is nothing to learn and you can pick up any such score for any tuning system whatsoever, and so long as the keyboard is correctly tuned to match the score then you can play it straight off without any learning whatsoever.</p><p>So anyway - that&apos;s just to say - that I find also there are lots of different contexts where one can use the # / b symbols, and it doesn&apos;t seem to cause any problems unless there is some confusion about which context is intended. So - this is just to give examples of a couple of other possible ways that they could be used in addition to the conventional sense and  the MegaScore sense.</p><p>The scordatura sense in particular I think seems obviously eminently sensible, is about as far as you can get from pitch indication - and doesn&apos;t cause any problems to the player. Scordatura scores in one form or another have been with us for centuries for string music, where if there was to be any cognitive dissonance, you would think it would be felt particularly acutely.</p><p>To answer your point Dave, it may be that if you aren&apos;t going to fulfull conventional expectations, it may be that it works better if you fulfill none of them or few of them, rather than to fulfill many but not all.</p><p>It would be confusing if e.g. to make up a deliberately confusing system - the accidentals had the same meaning as Sagittal pure j.i. notation (as an adjustment applied to pythagorean 12-t) for all notes except for E alone, where it was used for an adjustment of a comma instead of a semitone. Or if one were to write the first page of a piece in Sagittal and the second page in MegaScore, then that might be pretty confusing and not a very good idea unless one had good reasons for it - though the systems are distinct enough, particlarly with the change in the number of lines in the staff, that one could imagine a performer fluent in both could make the transition without too much trouble even so.</p><p>So, perhaps the reason Megascore works for users of the system is that it is sufficiently distinct from conventional score, also indeed from Sagittal - to not cause any cognitive dissonance?</p><p>As a programmer ones main aim is to make something that is user friendly and works for the users of ones programs. Suggestions from theorists (including ideas one may consider and maybe reject oneself before the software was even written) are likely to be looked on more favourably if  they help one with  those aims. So that&apos;s a reason for favouring familiar symbols if one possibly can do it without confusion, and if one can explain it to ones users in a way that make them acceptable and won&apos;t hinder them in other  ways. I don&apos;t think MegaScore would hinder understanding of Sagittal or other type conventional staff + accidental type pitch height indicating systems, nor do Scordatura scores,  or the accidentals for scale degree increments notaitons, in my opinion, so they are all (along with perhaps many more options) acceptable notations to use in a program interface</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2007 10:08:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave,</p><p>Wonderful insights!</p><p>As for the &quot;next higher&quot; issue, all I can say with certain is this is<br/>how I&apos;ve been thinking about it:</p><p>My rudimentary theory education basically taught me that no possible<br/>note EXISTS within 100 cents, and then all through my music degree,<br/>the people I found to be questioning or differing from that only<br/>brought it up on my instigation for the most part.  Hence, next<br/>possible note was always taught basically as a standard half-step.</p><p>What I love about the average JND concept is that I can actually<br/>pretend that the *NEW* 205ET system, the &quot;next higher&quot; note really<br/>*is* the very next *possible*.  In other words, instead of my<br/>thinking, &quot;oh, # means next note, but there&apos;s tons of possible<br/>systems, so which is this?&quot; - I think: &quot;Ah, I now understand that<br/>notes a lot closer than 100 cents exist, the next closer note in music<br/>as a whole is a JND!&quot;  Because a JND by definition is the closest we<br/>can be to be perceptibly different.</p><p>As for the REAL fact that harmony requires more precision, my desire<br/>is STRONGLY against having different inflection symbols for that<br/>precision, because once we are within a single JND, it truly does not<br/>matter exactly how far the pitch is from the natural or the next JND<br/>or from some absolute, it only matters that it is relatively matched<br/>to concurrent pitches.</p><p>For example, if I want the pitches Re to Do to be tuned to 4:7,<br/>certainly it *does* matter whether Do stays at 1/1 and Re is sharped<br/>to 8/7 vs whether Re is 9/8 and Do flats to 63/32.  But those are all<br/>more than a JND away, so I can clearly notate in MegaScore which one<br/>is to stay diatonic and which is to adjust, or even a compromise.<br/>Now, once I have notated Re to be within a JND of 9/8 and Do to be<br/>within a JND of 63/32, I believe it is *totally* musicially irrelevant<br/>which of those pitches WITHING its own JND range adjusts flat or sharp<br/>to make the pure JI harmony.  What matters melodically is that I&apos;ve<br/>identified the JND general location of each pitch.  What matters<br/>harmonically is that they are a true JI 4:7.  It will be absolutely<br/>imperceptible to any listener exactly the specifics within the JND of<br/>what adjusting is done to make the JI pure.  Again, all that matters<br/>is *that* the JI is pure, and melodically, where the pitches are in a<br/>system of average JNDs.</p><p>In many cases, the ear is even less perceptible to changes larger than<br/>a JND, but by defintion, the JND is our unit to work with.</p><p>In barbershop notation, the standard thing today is to notate a D and<br/>a C and theorists can identify that it is part of a D7 chord, then<br/>instruction is given basically to &quot;lock that 7th&quot; with no clarity on<br/>who should adjust how to that, just do it.  This is obviously<br/>inadequately vague, although some learn ways to work with this by<br/>rote, which means some people get it and some don&apos;t and that&apos;s that.</p><p>With MegaScore, if I notated an approximate 4:7 within the JND<br/>specificity, and then said &quot;lock that 7th&quot; I think any singer would<br/>probably already be locked once they got in range of the JND since no<br/>other interval would make much sense without moving more than a JND away.</p><p>I know this is a bold claim, but I&apos;m arguing that harmonic absolutes<br/>are clearly more important than melodic absolutes.  I&apos;m arguing that<br/>the JND is our absolute limit for needing any melodic specificity, and<br/>that harmonic specificity should not be notated with symbols next to<br/>notes.  Symbols next to notes indicate an absolute adjustment relative<br/>to prior notes or following notes or to a key center.  Harmonic<br/>precision is independent of that, it only matters how it matches to<br/>concurrent notes.  The only inflection marking that would do that<br/>would be something saying &quot;this is the 5 identity of the chord&quot; and<br/>not something that had anything to do with specifically raising or<br/>lowering the pitch.  I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s the best way to do it, but<br/>I&apos;m not opposed to that idea, or maybe the idea of different note-head<br/>shapes indicating such things...</p><p>So again, I&apos;m actually arguing that the JND concept should be some<br/>sort of standard and that # is defined as &quot;the next possible pitch&quot;<br/>which is equivalent to saying &quot;the next JND.&quot;  And that should be its<br/>new standard definition (a bold assertion for sure).  But I&apos;m saying<br/>this is consistent with a major aspect of its historical standard use.<br/> And any other system between standard and JND can go ahead and make<br/>up their own NEW symbols and not bother with #.  Ok this last stuff is<br/>maybe over-the-top, but the MAIN important point I&apos;m making is about<br/>these perceptual differences between melody and harmony, and how that<br/>makes very precise single-note tuning markings a bad idea.</p><p>It&apos;s kind of like how Hermode tuning works, or the average JI concept<br/>of the Haaken Continuum feature...  Their argument is that melodic<br/>shifting of even comma size and larger can be ignored to a degree<br/>while creating some compromise resulting in pure harmony.  If that<br/>wasn&apos;t at least partly true, then Hermode tuning truly wouldn&apos;t be<br/>even successful enough to get past concept and actually exist.  What<br/>I&apos;m arguing for is something like a Hermode tuning for the 205ET, JND<br/>specific system.  In fact, I think I&apos;ll recommend this to Mr. Hunt<br/>specifically.  The point is that within a JND, any compromise can be<br/>done to create the simplest JI ratio for that very small adjustment room.</p><p>So, with this way of looking at it, when would you ever need &quot;next<br/>note in the system&quot; to be specified differently?  We would just<br/>understand by definition that a JND is obviously the next perceptible<br/>note...  no other specific need exist.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, the &quot;next note higher&quot; idea obviously requires some concept of<br/>&gt; &gt; a closed system, whether equal or diatonic or whatever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mr Wolf,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On thinking further about your &quot;next higher note in the system&quot; point<br/>&gt; of view, I realise that it doesn&apos;t really get us anywhere.

But you don&apos;t have to unlearn one subsystem to move<br/>to another, they are all consistent with each other. Symbols do change<br/>size between subsystems, but only slightly, not by factors of 16 or 20.</p><p>&gt; I know this is a bold claim, but I&apos;m arguing that harmonic absolutes<br/>&gt; are clearly more important than melodic absolutes.</p><p>I see nothing bold in that. I think it is well accepted.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;m arguing that<br/>&gt; the JND is our absolute limit for needing any melodic specificity,</p><p>I suspect many people find 72-ET to be close enough to a continuum for<br/>melodic purposes.</p><p>&gt; and<br/>&gt; that harmonic specificity should not be notated with symbols next to<br/>&gt; notes.  Symbols next to notes indicate an absolute adjustment relative<br/>&gt; to prior notes or following notes or to a key center.  Harmonic<br/>&gt; precision is independent of that, it only matters how it matches to<br/>&gt; concurrent notes.  The only inflection marking that would do that<br/>&gt; would be something saying &quot;this is the 5 identity of the chord&quot; and<br/>&gt; not something that had anything to do with specifically raising or<br/>&gt; lowering the pitch.  I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s the best way to do it, but<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not opposed to that idea, or maybe the idea of different note-head<br/>&gt; shapes indicating such things...</p><p>It is possible to do both, to some degree. i.e. To have a symbol<br/>represent both an approximate adjustment relative to some other pitch,<br/>_and_ a particular identity of the chord.

Their argument is that melodic<br/>&gt; shifting of even comma size and larger can be ignored to a degree<br/>&gt; while creating some compromise resulting in pure harmony.  If that<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t at least partly true, then Hermode tuning truly wouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; even successful enough to get past concept and actually exist.  What<br/>&gt; I&apos;m arguing for is something like a Hermode tuning for the 205ET, JND<br/>&gt; specific system.  In fact, I think I&apos;ll recommend this to Mr. Hunt<br/>&gt; specifically.  The point is that within a JND, any compromise can be<br/>&gt; done to create the simplest JI ratio for that very small adjustment<br/>room.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, with this way of looking at it, when would you ever need &quot;next<br/>&gt; note in the system&quot; to be specified differently?  We would just<br/>&gt; understand by definition that a JND is obviously the next perceptible<br/>&gt; note...  no other specific need exist.</p><p>I think you&apos;re fooling yourself.

It doesn&apos;t show identity in the sense of functional harmony.  A note with constant pitch would likely be a long note with a sign in front of it.</p><p>Adaptive tuning has to be done outside the notation, which is the whole point.  Sagittal is better as a framework for adaptive tuning because you&apos;re writing interval types rather than pitches.  It works the same way that standard notation does when it isn&apos;t pinning down the tuning.</p><p>With MegaScore you are writing pitches to the nearest JND so there&apos;s a chance the notation will imply more precision than the composer intended.  Using it with adaptive tuning would mean notating the output of an algorithm rather than the input.  Unless what you&apos;re doing happens to fit 41 notes, as you think it might.</p><p>I though you were saying that something wouldn&apos;t work in sagittal, and without an example I can&apos;t see where the problem would be.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2007 11:18:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I would do that, but I don&apos;t know how to get the musical &gt;&gt;examples typeset.

For now I&apos;m happy with the mathematics.</p><p>&gt;&gt;My suggestion, anyway, is very simple: change the default # &gt;&gt;and b symbols for meantones.  Let&apos;s say ||\ as a compromise &gt;&gt;between Bb-F as a 3:2 and A-C# as a 5:4.<br/>&gt; &gt; And do you mean keep the native fifth as the notational fifth (the one<br/>&gt; between nominals)? Or do you mean to use a pythagorean fifth? And what<br/>&gt; symbol for the semisharp in 31-ET? Currently /|\.</p><p>I mean leave the nominals as they are but translate # to ||\ and b to the equivalent.  That means thirds and fifths involving one nominal a little bit off relative to JI notation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m also thinking about magic, and maybe this colours my &gt;&gt;reasoning.  The 19 note magic scale should be notated &gt;&gt;consistently with the 19 note meantone scale.  But it can&apos;t &gt;&gt;be identical because there&apos;s no string of 7 notes separated &gt;&gt;by perfect fifths to be the nominals.  So I want to base &gt;&gt;magic on a 5-limit notation while having it look as much as &gt;&gt;possible as meantone.  Which by the law of the excluded &gt;&gt;middle means that meantone has to be consistent with 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt; &gt; Not really following. Sounds like a bad idea to me, if you mean notate<br/>&gt; it as if it were planar, not linear.</p><p>There&apos;s no obvious linear notation that fits with the 7 nominals.  And no obvious alternative octave size for that matter.  If you write it as a chain of major thirds it goes off the scale.  So there has to be a compromise.</p><p>The 19 note magic scale can be written as a periodicity block.  That means there are no notes that differ by the tempered syntonic comma.  So each note has a unique meantone representation, and you can even use 19-note enharmonies. But you can still use comma accidentals to remind the reader that it isn&apos;t meantone.  When you use more than 19 notes the comma shifts become important.</p><p>&gt; Magic has 5 generators to the fifth, so to notate it with<br/>&gt; chain-of-fifth nominals you need at least 2 pairs of accidentals and<br/>&gt; it will be nearly as bad as a chain of fifths notation for miracle,<br/>&gt; which has 6 gens to the fifth and so needs 3 pairs of accidentals<br/>&gt; (floor(n/2)). And you&apos;d have to go to 41-ET to get those accidentals<br/>&gt; /| and /|\ in the same way you go to 72-ET to get the accidentals for<br/>&gt; miracle.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m thinking in mixed sagittal, as I usually do, so here I mean 2<br/>pairs of single-shaft accidentals in addition to conventional sharp<br/>and flat (or the equivalent larger set of multishaft sagittals).</p><p>That&apos;s right.  So for smaller sets you need to break the chain of fifths.</p><p>&gt; But then your notational fifth for magic is not a meantone fifth, but<br/>&gt; a very nearly pythagorean one.</p><p>Yes.  But the accidentals don&apos;t take you to pythagorean notes.  So the (or some) accidentals would likely be shared with meantone notation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I suppose magic and pythagorean notations should also unify &gt;&gt;on 41-equal.<br/>&gt; &gt; That sounds do-able, but not meantone too.</p><p>Certainly not if meantone and pythagorean share notations for the spirals of fifths.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Now, the web page *I* would like to see is a comparison of &gt;&gt;sagittal with the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI system.

And as doubly diminished fourths won&apos;t be that common outside of magic temperaments you won&apos;t go far wrong by assuming this is generally the case.  Maybe the accidentals can be chosen so that the magic unison vector becomes a suitably small interval in JI.</p><p>Another feature is that all fifths that approximate 3:2 are spelt correctly.  That&apos;s also true of schismatic temperament.  In both cases the fifths will typically be tuned almost pure.  So they can share the comma shift symbol with just intonation.  Performers can learn that when they see a score with these comma shifts, they should play correctly spelt fifths pure.</p><p>(In 22-equal, for example, you still need comma shifts but the fifths are significantly wider.  For such tunings, even within a magic framework, I&apos;d suggest a distinct single shaft accidental.)</p><p>There are various cues that will suggest a magic context. The music will tend to drift along a spiral of thirds rather than fifths.  The score will have a relatively small set of accidentals with comma shifts.  Pythagorean intevals will be rare.  All this will enforce the habit of tuning major thirds a little flat and making those doubly diminished fourths into major thirds.</p><p>I&apos;m leaving the 7-limit intervals to one side.  The temperaments I mention all have 225:224 as a unison vector so there&apos;ll be a natural consistency.</p><p>&gt; OK. I guess I see what you&apos;re talking about now. If you use #\ instead<br/>&gt; of # for meantones then more notes of 19-EDO will have the same<br/>&gt; notation whether notated as Meantone[19] or Magic[19].</p><p>The idea is that certain intervals will be consistent between temperaments.  A meantone score will mix apparently Pythagorean with (nearly) 5-limit thirds.  It&apos;ll also have no comma shifts and imply bad fifths between nominals and other notes.  This should suggest a meantone context to the performer so that they can flatten the fifths and interpret triads on the nominals as approximating the 5-limit.</p><p>If a score contains comma shifts, then a third on the nominals will naturally be played as pythagorean. Similarly, if sharps and flats are used to give pythagorean intervals but nothing else the performer can assume the nominals should be pythagorean.</p><p>If a performer misreads the context, the errors should be minimal because the accidentals will guide them towards the correct notes.</p><p>This all seems to me to be the way sagittal should work -- at least for reasonably accurate temperaments on a conventional staff.  It ties in with other design choices like having a consistent set of symbols with the number of shafts and direction of the arrow indicating the size. Maybe it won&apos;t work in practice, but until we know that it&apos;s the simple, consistent system I suggest.</p><p>I proposed a system for magic with 9 nominals on tuning-math.  I think that&apos;s the natural &quot;native&quot; notation for magic.  Only experience can show how it compares with adapting to a conventional staff.  The two approaches are naturally inconsistent (like with MegaScore) but can still share the set of accidentals.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
