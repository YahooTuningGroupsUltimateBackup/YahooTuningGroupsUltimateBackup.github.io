The nearest comparison in<br/>12et c-d-e-f or c-d-e-f# ones ear is completely confused as to what is<br/>meant.<br/>    It would be possible to do ligeti like clusters and still have an<br/>unambiguous tonic. In fact it wouold be interesting to hear clusters in the<br/>same range that modulated through a cycle of fifths.</p><p><a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think this idea of dissonance=ambiguity can be used as a<br/>&gt; characterization in any kind of tuning system, JI, ET, or other.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
