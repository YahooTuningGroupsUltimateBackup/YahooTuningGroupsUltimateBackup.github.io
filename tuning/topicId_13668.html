That&apos;s the inharmonicity.</p><p>Yeah, watch out for those fancy new popular Elixer brand strings, those of you who play JI<br/>guitars.  I&apos;ve noticed that they tend to lean toward a piano sound throughout the range.  I&apos;m<br/>guessing that they get the &quot;longer life&quot; by adding stiffness to the strings somehow.  I&apos;m<br/>guessing that&apos;s why they sound a little bit brittle and less warm than other guitar strings -<br/>inharmonicity due to increased stiffness.  They don&apos;t feel stiffer, really, but maybe they&apos;ve<br/>compensated by allowing slightly less tension or something.  I haven&apos;t done any tests, just<br/>going by what I&apos;ve heard in recording sessions.  Just be warned that a JI guitar will probably<br/>exhibit more beating between partials with Elixer strings.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

They retain their high-end<br/>longer than the Marquis strings,  however, there isn&apos;t as much of it when<br/>compared to a brand new set of Marquis.  Session players that change strings<br/>a lot don&apos;t care for them, but those of us that have to keep a set on for a<br/>while do.

The only<br/>reason I&apos;ve been sticking with Elixirs is &quot;normal&quot; guitar strings<br/>would quickly wear grooves into the fingerboard of my guitar.  To use<br/>other brands would require a much harder surface such as glass,<br/>metal, or an epoxy coating on the fingerboard.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
