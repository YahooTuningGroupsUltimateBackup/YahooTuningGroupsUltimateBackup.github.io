While Partch&apos;s ontonalities and untonalities are harmonic series segments, and his theory of consonance clearly depends upon regular harmonic spectra, Partch himself avoids discussion of the harmonic series. Indeed, I suspect from his practical experience with the real overtones of real instruments, that Partch was extremely cautious about this point.  On the other hand, one of Lou Harrison&apos;s initial impulses in designing Gamlean Si Betty, his and Bill&apos;s first large Javanese style instrument, was to find a tuning from within the upper reaches of the harmonic series, i.e. as a &quot;cloud of harmonics&quot; (Lou&apos;s own phrase).  He had Bill make up a series of aluminum slabs tuned in the proportions of the first 64 partials. He chose a slendro and a pelog from the series and received approval from Pak Cokro, who was teaching in a neighboring office at the time.  Later, with the Mills gamelan, he went with a trichordal model and revised one tone in Si Betty to also conform to a trichordal scheme (making my own piece for trombone and gamelan unplayable, by the way). But these trichordal tunings are also to be found within a reasonably low segment of the harmonic series.   The other just intonation gamelan of the era used a variety of approaches, the most interesting being perhpas that of Other Music, which used the cross set associated with Max F. Meyer.  (Ironically, I remember one of the Other Musicians complaining about Erv Wilson&apos;s CPS structure, and had to laugh because their system housed a CPS or two as well).</p><p>Altogether, I don&apos;t think that the paragraph on American gamelan belongs here.  Gamelan tunings are made in the context of a mixture of simple harmonic and complex spectra, and the connection to this topic is tenuous.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2008 9:52:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May I make two suggestions about the Limit article?</p><p>Sure.
