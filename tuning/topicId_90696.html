I&apos;ve now corrected this. I won&apos;t give any proofs now but just the method. I&apos;ve attached a file which shows that the peaks of the wave do indeed occur at the GCD&apos;s between the (wave) convergents.</p><p>Given the sum of two sines of the form</p><p>f(t) = sin[2pi at] + sin[2pi bt],</p><p>where a/b is either coprime or irrational, then its extrema occur at the times t = (2k +/-1)/2(a + b) where</p><p>(2k +/-1) = (Round to even[j*2(a + b)/(a - b)]) +/- 1, j = 0,1,2,3,...</p><p>The wave convergents are given by</p><p>Round[2a/(a - b)]/Round[2b/(a - b) = p/q.</p><p>The ~ GCD = (a + b)/(p + q) or</p><p>2(a + b)/(Round[2a/(a - b)] + Round[2b/(a - b)]).</p><p>You can see some examples on the file I&apos;ve posted called &quot;Round Odd eg&apos;s&quot;. It shows the intervals a/b = 81/64, 19/16, 32/27 and 51/32 respectively. There you&apos;ll see that the black dots occur at all the wave extrema and that the time difference between them correspond to the GCD fundamentals between the wave convergents.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Rick</p></div>
