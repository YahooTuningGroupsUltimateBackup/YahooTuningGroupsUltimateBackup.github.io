But let me m=<br/>ake my confusion clear: On the one hand, we have the 72-note melakarta syste=<br/>m in Karnatic music. Those 72 scales are raga-s, too -- they can be elaborat=<br/>ed. On the other hand, we have Bhatkhande&apos;s 10-thaat classification to work =<br/>as the raga generators. But these 10 thaat-s are NOT raga-s -- they cannot b=<br/>e performed. And then we have the raganga paddhati (system). The latter clas=<br/>sifies raga-s in terms of some fundamental structures. This classification i=<br/>s not scales at all; they are actual raga-s to be performed. I am looking fo=<br/>r scales only.</p><p>Now, using the 12-note Indian gamut, we can derive 32 scales -- and ONLY 32=<br/>. They are scales, not raga-s. Let me show that, though this is very obvious=<br/>:</p><p>The 16 (of the 32) thaat-s, using F (and not F#):<br/>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>1. C D E F<br/>2. C Db E F<br/>3. C D Fb F<br/>4. C Db Eb F</p><p>Each of the above combines with each of the following:</p><p>1. G A B c<br/>2. G Ab B c<br/>3. G A Bb c<br/>4. G Ab Bb c</p><p>This gives 16 thaat-s. Now, by substituting F above with F#, we get other 1=<br/>6 -- a total of 32. [This better than the Bhatkhande system, because it acco=<br/>mmodates several more raga-s than the former system.]</p><p>The query: There is nothing fundamental about this.

Then for each 2,3-reduced ratio we found all the kommas having an absolute 3-exponent not greater than 12 and a size not greater than 70 cents. I imagine these ranges would need to be increased for the temperament project. There was another constraint on komma &quot;slope&quot; which I won&apos;t go into here as it probably isn&apos;t relevant to your purposes.</p><p>The first part of the komma name is simply the two sides of the 2,3-reduced ratio, with a colon between. As a convention, we put the smallest number first. If one side of the reduced ratio is unity, we omit it, and the colon. When speaking, the colon is not pronounced. And you are welcome to pronounce 1 (which is equivalent to 3 in this system) as &quot;Pythagorean&quot;, 5 as &quot;classic&quot;, 7 as &quot;septimal&quot;, 11 as &quot;undecimal&quot;, etc., but I find it&apos;s easier just to say them in English.</p><p>The second part of the name is one of</p><p>schismina<br/>schisma<br/>kleisma<br/>comma<br/>small diesis<br/>(medium) diesis<br/>large diesis</p><p>This part of the name is made to do double duty. It not only gives the size category, but it distinguishes multiple kommas for the same 2,3-reduced ratio. To do this, the boundaries between categories have to be chosen very carefully. An intial set of category names and approximate boundaries were obtained by looking at the existing komma names in Scala&apos;s intnam.par.</p><p>Then we worked our way down the ratio popularity list, and whenever we found two kommas for the same ratio in the same category, we moved an existing boundary if we could do so without upsetting any previous ratios, or otherwise added a new boundary and category.</p><p>We didn&apos;t bother moving a boundary to separate two commas for the same ratio when they were less than about 0.7 c apart, but I imagine you would need to do this for your purposes. We also made boundary decisions based on the boundaries between sagittal symbols which would not be relevant. So you might repeat this process with larger 3-exponents etc., and come up with slightly different boundaries and more size categories. Some of the boundaries we obtained are very similar to some obtained by Monz in<br/><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/monzo/o483-26new5limitnames.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/monzo/o483-26new5limitnames.htm</a></p><p>Here&apos;s what we are using (cents)<br/>0<br/>schismina<br/>0.98<br/>schisma<br/>4.5<br/>kleisma<br/>13.47<br/>comma<br/>36.93<br/>small diesis<br/>45.11<br/>(medium) diesis<br/>56.84<br/>large diesis<br/>68.57</p><p>Some of these are very precisely defined as they are exact square-roots of 3-limit kommas. The boundaries seem to naturally want to fall on these. 56.84 is actually a half apotome. 45.11 is actually a half Pythagorean limma. The kleisma/comma boundary really wants to be half the Pythagorean comma and the comma/small-diesis boundary seems to want to be about 33.38 cents, which looks like half the [27,-17] comma. The medium/large diesis boundary is at half of [-30,19].</p><p> Maybe the next higher boundary (large diesis/small semitone?) should be at 78.49 c, half of [35,-22]. The schismina/schisma and schisma/kleisma boundaries were not actually needed (by us) to distinguish same-ratio kommas, and so are somewhat arbitrary, but maybe they can usefully be assigned roots of other 3-limit commas.</p><p>And by the way, I think that, in general, new or obscure temperaments are more usefully named after their generators, than their vanishing commas.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/">http://dkeenan.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=47099 href="#47099">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/2003 7:00:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;can we come up with names for the commas that still<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;don&apos;t have names?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Again, a tuning-math question.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;why is that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because that&apos;s where lists of commas are usually posted around<br/>&gt; here, and where people usually go to become immortalized through<br/>&gt; nomenclature.</p><p>but since when is something as basic to tuning as<br/>names of intervals too technical for this list?</p><p>i can understand using the tuning-math forum for<br/>something that really does get deeply into the math,<br/>but come on, this is tuning kindergarten stuff.</p><p>anyway ... i see that Dave Keenan has apologetically<br/>posted the most substantial response to this thread on<br/>that list, so i pursue if further over there.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=47108 href="#47108">ðŸ”—</a>XTINA@PLATEA.PNTIC.MEC.ES</h3><span>9/17/2003 2:29:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, but I&apos;m trying to sign off the list... but I can&acute;t get it.
