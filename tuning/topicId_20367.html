(Promise not to release it!)</p><p>I plan to make the FAQ tree making program a free and open source program,</p><p>(could leave out the section that makes the groups archives if it is<br/>problematical to include it).</p><p>Not sure how useful the complete program will be to other programmers as<br/>it is written in windows c at rather a low level, lots of use of<br/>malloc etc, which most C++ programmers never go near!</p><p>Style is low level too. (I&apos;ve never learnt C++ as C has always<br/>been fine for me and I&apos;ve been able to do anything needed using<br/>c so far).</p><p>However, does have some nice routines that could be useful to use.</p><p>For instance, I devised a new structure<br/>typedef struct<br/>{<br/>     char *sz;<br/>     int ipos;<br/>     int itotal_length;<br/>     char szPFile[MAX_PATH];<br/>}<br/>SFILE;</p><p>which one can use in place of the usual FILE * of c.</p><p>At present it is only implemented for sfopen(..,&quot;w&quot;) and<br/>for sfprintf(...) (obviously, the same syntax as fopen(..)<br/>and fprintf(..), but may eventually extend it to<br/>other c stdio type subroutines.</p><p>The idea of it is that you can use SFILE *pointers instead<br/>of FILE *pointers and just do a search and replace of your<br/>code to make code that runs in Windows using the efficient<br/>file handles instead of file pointers, which makes it easy<br/>to port code to / from other environments, plus fprintf<br/>is a very nice function to be able to use, which you don&apos;t really<br/>have anything like in Windows low level c file i.o.</p><p>One usually ends up using sprintf instead and keeping track<br/>of ones position in the output string, which this method does<br/>automatically.</p><p>(<br/>programming details:<br/>sfprintf increments the ipos variable whenever you use it,<br/>and checks the itotal_length, and reallocs the sz if nec.<br/>and sfopen(..) puts the desired path into szPFile[..], which<br/>is then used to save the file using the faster Windows file<br/>handles when you choose sfclose(..)<br/>)</p><p>However that will mainly appeal to those who work in c at a fairly<br/>low level too, I imagine.</p><p>Also some nice wrapper functions for the Tree view, and<br/>some other sprintf like things such as<br/>sprintAddToComboNoDuplicatesExactLC(..)<br/>to make it possible to add a string to a combo, at the same<br/>time convert it to lower case, format it sprintf style,<br/>and check for duplicates. I use that one a lot!</p><p>Could be useful to some?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/30/2001 7:29:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20367">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20367</a></p><p>&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a zip of the last 1000 tuning posts organised by subject,<br/>author and date.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/tuning_19350-20350.zip">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tree/tuning_19350-20350.zip</a><br/>&gt; 1,437 Kb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May help those who are looking for material they have already<br/>posted<br/>to the TL, and want to use for the FAQ.</p><p>This is really execellent, and valuable.

After all, the former archives<br/>of the Mills List have been mostly lost, apparently, and we wouldn&apos;t<br/>want that to happen to this list.  Of course, there is lots of<br/>nonsense on this list, part of which I am responsible for posting,<br/>but<br/>there are some great &quot;gems&quot; as well...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m thinking about possiblity of releasing the program that can<br/>make this, but aren&apos;t so sure about whether one should.

I guess that&apos;s<br/>possible, but I would rather doubt it...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s so easy to do with this program that I imagine it could be<br/>quite a popular freebie!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone got any thoughts on this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, not altogether sure about how it is copyright wise,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel it is okay if one is doing it for the use of other members<br/>of the group, who can search for the messages on-line anyway, but<br/>would welcome comments, and will withdraw it if anyone thinks it is a<br/>breach of copyright in any way.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, it&apos;s pretty easy to copy messages as it is, so I really don&apos;t<br/>see what the difference is.  Members are pretty much responsible<br/>THEMSELVES to adhere to the copyright code, and not SELL the content<br/>of the posts.  Frankly, I believe the possibility of selling posts is<br/>a rather remote one.

If it&apos;s not wise that we all have this program (I<br/>don&apos;t really see any problems) then perhaps the entire archive should<br/>be downloaded onto CD-ROM or some such.</p><p>I would certainly be willing to PAY expenses to receive such a<br/>CD-ROM... as a backup, and I don&apos;t really believe this is a violation<br/>of copyright, since my own personal use, and I imagine that of<br/>everybody elses, would be exclusively as an educational tool, not as<br/>a commercial enterprise...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>________ ______ ______ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
