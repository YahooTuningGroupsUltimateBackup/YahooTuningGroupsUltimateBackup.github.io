(That&apos;s how long I haven&apos;t had a computer).  I&apos;ve been a performer and student of Erv Wilson&apos;s and Kraig Grady&apos;s methods and I can still say I wish they&apos;d be be more forthcoming about what it is they&apos;re doing.  At the same time, I think there&apos;s much to to be considered in the context of &quot;Let she who has ears...hear.&quot;</p><p>   As it was given to me by Harry Partch (and others), JI--Just Intonation--is what The Ideal Ear wants to hear.  But I don&apos;t think HP (especially!) ever made a distinction between that and what my ears want to hear: simple whole number ratios.  At its most basic level, I don&apos;t believe there&apos;s really any difference between any numerical abstraction--and isn&apos;t &apos;number&apos; the penultimate abstraction?--and what the ear wants or does not want to hear.  (There&apos;s a joke about &apos;drum and drummer&apos;--may I suggest &apos;numb and number&apos;?).</p><p>   Without waxing metaphysical on the subject, I think the whole point is simply not to underestimate what human beings are capable of perceiving!  At that point--which was Partch&apos;s point--a few cents matters, and a dozen becomes a controversy.  Then, god bless this list, we experience the eloquent contestants in that controversy.  And then also we find out who is a nihilist and who believes in and is willing to do something creative.</p><p>   Again it must be said, don&apos;t underestimate what you or I or anyone else can hear.  No, I&apos;m not absolutely certain that my 3/2&apos;s and 5/4&apos;s are within fractions of a cent true, but I know and accept when--and why!--they&apos;re not.  And at that point, precision becomes poetry, I hope.</p><p>Thanks (again!) for the extaordinary work--all y&apos;all!</p><p>Pete McRae</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Make a great connection at Yahoo!

It&apos;s been<br/>suggested that 72 is &quot;effectively&quot; JI, which I don&apos;t buy, but I think<br/>you can make a case for the 171-et, with errors less than 1/2 cent,<br/>as being effectively JI so far as the 7-limit goes.</p></div>
