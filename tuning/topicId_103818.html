They&apos;ll say stuff like &quot;I still don&apos;t know<br/>how to play in 12 yet, man.&quot; The people who are less trained and who<br/>really don&apos;t know how to play in 12 will be more receptive.</p><p>2) You have to know a bit about the personality of the person you&apos;re<br/>trying to sell this to. What&apos;s the best way to push it - does this<br/>approach represent &quot;freedom from the constraints of 12?&quot; Is it<br/>&quot;xenharmonic music,&quot; meaning &quot;strange yet familiar?&quot; Is it just that<br/>you&apos;re exploring &quot;music in exotic tuning systems?&quot; Is it &quot;purer<br/>harmony than 12&quot; you&apos;re after? These different views of the same thing<br/>target different people, and you mismatch them at your peril. (A<br/>professional jazz musician, for instance, may not feel like music<br/>represented by a strange-sounding greek word promoting &quot;strange&quot; (yet<br/>familiar) music that provides &quot;purer harmony than 12&quot; is anything he<br/>cares about, but he might like &quot;music in exotic tuning systems.&quot;)</p><p>3) There&apos;s always this balance to strike between theory and practice.<br/>If you tell people too much theory at first, they&apos;re going to run away<br/>(and even talking about ratios at all is &quot;too much theory&quot; for a lot<br/>of people). can be good, but stay away from the heavier stuff at<br/>first. But, if you just hand people 31-EDO and don&apos;t give them any<br/>guidance at all, they might feel overwhelmed. Andrew and Jacob might<br/>have some better ideas on how to tackle this. I always thought that<br/>certain tunings might be better for this than others but I don&apos;t know<br/>which ones people will respond to best in general. There&apos;s<br/>7-EDO/14-EDO as a one trick pony, or you could try 15-EDO to have them<br/>mess with blackwood, or you could do some JI, or 11-EDO for relatively<br/>good 4:7:9:11, or 9-EDO or 16-EDO for mavila, or 17-EDO or maybe<br/>19-EDO. I dunno what people tend to respond to best, and it also<br/>depends on what they can play without needing much guidance if you&apos;re<br/>trying to do hands-on stuff.</p><p>I do note that people tend to think that harmonic series stuff is<br/>really cool. Maybe you could load up harmonics 16-32 and let them go<br/>nuts at first. You should also make sure they understand that that&apos;s<br/>only one of the cool things you can do in novel tuning systems and not<br/>the whole point of it though. Things like 7-EDO aren&apos;t very accurate<br/>but are still pretty awesome and interesting, especially if you&apos;re<br/>just starting out.</p><p>4) When you do end up moving to theory, if you do at all, I always<br/>thought 19-EDO might be a good choice to start things off. 19-EDO<br/>supports meantone, but instead of saying C# and Db are the same, you<br/>say that the distance between C and C# is the same as the distance<br/>between C# and Db. It&apos;s still very logical and makes easy conceptual<br/>sense, but you can then show how it leads to completely new enharmonic<br/>modulations and some slightly different properties (three major thirds<br/>no longer equals an octave, for example). Once they get their head<br/>wrapped around that, which is a significant undertaking in and of<br/>itself, maybe then they&apos;re ready to mess with theory in some other<br/>tuning systems, like 22 or whatever.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2012 11:03:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah, interesting. All of my current students happen to be middle-schoolers (by chance), so getting into technical details of how to tune simply doesn&apos;t apply right now. I don&apos;t specifically mention microtonality or just intonation by name at all; if the course of a lesson takes the right turn (most of them are still working on just getting the instrument to respons consistently, learning how to read music, things like that, although a couple of them are ahead of the learning curve) I will simply suggest something like &quot;try tuning this note this way and see what you hear.&quot;</p><p>I haven&apos;t been bringing in recordings for them to check out. For starters, there really isn&apos;t that much out there for brass players that uses anything beyond what is implied for the classical performance practice of getting chords in tune and the occasional melodic pitch-bending of jazz. Although, I have been thinking of throwing a short recording of the Kepler Quartet at a couple of them. But even then, I feel that it would be most beneficial for them to listen to stuff that they are working on already, so they can do the immediate listen-and-imitate thing. One of my students (the most advanced) has recordings of Miles Davis and a book of Miles transcriptions, for example. My time with each student is limited, so I try to make the most of it.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;AWolf&quot; &lt;wolftune@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow, surprised to see the not-so-helpful comments otherwise, I thought lots of people would have ideas...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a private music teacher, and I teach JI and other tuning issues to my students.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my experience, teaching has been extremely valuable in showing *me* that tuning isn&apos;t really so fundamental all the time.

I dunno what people tend to respond to best, and it also<br/>&gt; depends on what they can play without needing much guidance if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; trying to do hands-on stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do note that people tend to think that harmonic series stuff is<br/>&gt; really cool. Maybe you could load up harmonics 16-32 and let them go<br/>&gt; nuts at first. You should also make sure they understand that that&apos;s<br/>&gt; only one of the cool things you can do in novel tuning systems and not<br/>&gt; the whole point of it though. Things like 7-EDO aren&apos;t very accurate<br/>&gt; but are still pretty awesome and interesting, especially if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; just starting out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) When you do end up moving to theory, if you do at all, I always<br/>&gt; thought 19-EDO might be a good choice to start things off. 19-EDO<br/>&gt; supports meantone, but instead of saying C# and Db are the same, you<br/>&gt; say that the distance between C and C# is the same as the distance<br/>&gt; between C# and Db. It&apos;s still very logical and makes easy conceptual<br/>&gt; sense, but you can then show how it leads to completely new enharmonic<br/>&gt; modulations and some slightly different properties (three major thirds<br/>&gt; no longer equals an octave, for example). Once they get their head<br/>&gt; wrapped around that, which is a significant undertaking in and of<br/>&gt; itself, maybe then they&apos;re ready to mess with theory in some other<br/>&gt; tuning systems, like 22 or whatever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2012 12:09:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Andrew,</p><p>You&apos;ve just mentioned that your students are middle-schoolers.<br/>Did you also let it slip that they are brass instrumentalists?<br/>Why not tell us something about what you&apos;re up to?</p><p>-Carl</p><p>--- In tuning@...m, &quot;bigAndrewM&quot; &lt;bigandrewm@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, yes, that might help a bit.

In our discussion we referred to the explanation and specific examples in David Doty&apos;s Just Intonation Primer, available from: <a href="http://www.justintonation.net/primer1.html">http://www.justintonation.net/primer1.html</a></p><p>Dave K. was in complete agreement with all of my observations, which I quote here in full, along with other comments I&apos;ve added [in square brackets] for clarification:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Now that I&apos;ve had a chance to look at it, I&apos;m amazed at how many things I can find to fault, without even counting the false D-to-A fifth.</p><p>1) I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just my Sagittal-arrow orientation, but I find it counter-intuitive that the 7 accidental (which not only seems to point *upward* but also sits *atop* the sharp and flat signs in Figures 5.1b and 5.2) actually *lowers* the pitch (by 32:35) and the inverted 7 (which not only seems to point *downward* but also sits *below* the sharp and flat signs in Figure 5.1b) actually *raises* the pitch.</p><p>[This is a matter of cosmetics rather than semantics and not a serious problem.]</p><p>2) In Figure 5.2 (the only diagram showing the symbols on a staff), the horizontal component of the +, -, 7, and inverted 7 signs tends to get lost when it gets too close to a staff line (see 32/27 on the 6th staff). The - sign is completely lost, and it&apos;s also rather difficult to distinguish an inverted 7 from a double-inverted 7 (see 8/7 vs. 64/49 and 12/7 vs. 64/49 on the bottom staff).</p><p>[Dave noted that this could be remedied by a properly designed font, e.g., something along the lines of our Sagittal-Wilson symbols could replace + - .]</p><p>3) Multiple accidentals make the size of the cumulative alteration difficult to estimate, particularly when they point in opposite directions.  In Figure 5.1b, in the second plane down, the symbol in the upper right corner is:<br/>A77++ (for 6615/4096)<br/>Relative to C (taking into account the need to decrease five&apos;s exponent by 1, since the nominal is A) this translates to [ 3, 1, 2 &gt;, which is<br/>Ab&apos;~|) and A&apos;~~!! in Sagittal herculean &amp; olympian, or<br/>Ab/|~ and A||~ promethean, or<br/>Ab(|( and A~||( athenian.<br/>With Sagittal, the flags at least give you a general idea of the amount of alteration.</p><p>[The Sagittal symbols for JI in the higher-than-athenian levels are admittedly rather unusual and/or complicated, but this is to be expected if you want to distinguish a complicated ratio from a simpler one with a separate symbol.  The herculean, promethean, and (especially) athenian levels of precision re-use symbols for simpler ratios to notate more complicated ratios, thereby allowing the composer to choose among several different levels of notational complexity.  (Athenian-level symbols are guaranteed to get you within 5.4 cents of the desired pitch of a complex ratio, and in the overwhelming majority of cases within 2 cents.  All reasonably simple 11-limit ratios are notated exactly.)  The point I was making is that, unlike Sagittal symbols, laterally &quot;stacked&quot; Johnston symbols often require mental gymnastics to determine the total amount of alteration.]</p><p>4) The C-centric 5-comma breaks in the chain-of-fifths nominals increase the number of irregularities in interpreting ratios when one goes above the 5-limit; e.g., 7/4 of C is Bb7, whereas 7/4 of G is F7+, 7/4 of A is G7, and 7/4 of B is A7+.  With Sagittal you can usually determine the prime factors in the ratio from the accidental, without taking the nominal into account. &gt;&gt;</p><p>[Those instances in which the nominal must be taken into account involve cases in which the same symbol is used for two different ratios differing by a very small amount, e.g., 35:36 (7-limit, 48.770 c) vs. 1024:1053 (13-limit, 48.348 c).  In such cases, the intended ratio is easily determined by the musical context.]</p><p>[End of quote]</p><p>A further point to consider is that stacked Johnston symbols do not seem very suitable for notating temperaments.  Dave &amp; I gave issues such as these a lot of thought as we sought (over the course of several years!) to define a single set of symbols that could notate virtually any tuning.</p><p>Andrew, for these reasons I hope you will take the time to give the Sagittal system serious consideration.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2012 12:26:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I AM giving it serious consideration.

It&apos;s easy as a connoisseur to get all wrapped up in the tuning details. However, students appreciate a lot of music even when they struggle to play any consistent tuning. That said, teaching JI and listening to beats and such is the best way to get them to be more sensitive.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My first recommendation is to be transparent. Tell your own story, describe the music you like and why. Share music with them without setting up an expectation that they&apos;ll like it or not. Most students will just hear everything as just more music. Unless they&apos;ve been absolutely brain-washed in 12EDO, most students don&apos;t see the big deal either way: they think all the different music just sounds like interesting music but not remarkably different. I&apos;ve been surprised when some students seem to react strongly and others have no reaction or are totally inconsistent about their feelings for different tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All this led me to accept that music is a subjective experience and describing the physical tunings out there in the world is the wrong approach. What&apos;s really going on is subjective categorical perception and such.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So that said, you can teach more conceptually (like ratios and such) or more experientially.

The biggest problem for me was the manuscript, that the multiple accidentals simply can look ugly and would not be easy to read, and that parts of the symbols can sometimes become lost in the staff lines.</p><p>The point #4 (given in the previous post cited below) still has me a bit undecided. Yes, unless the base C major scale is Pythagorean, the chain of fifths is broken. But I&apos;m not convinced that the fifths need to be pure for people to be able to read the music. I&apos;m trying to approach this from the performer&apos;s point of view rather than the composer&apos;s.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;m referring to Johnston&apos;s preference to use the 5-limit C major scale as the base scale. And Saggital looks like it will work in either case, either with the Pythagoream or the 5-limit C major scale.</p><p>Which is really cool. Great job in developing this, by the way. It definitely took a lot of work.</p><p>Someone who has never seen microtonal notation before (such someones would be the vast, vast majority of musicians) would want the initial presentation to be as simple as possible. This usually means &apos;how do I play a scale, and what does it look like?&apos; With the 5-limit assumption of C major, the player would simply play the scale as it sounds in-tune to them at the moment, and there is no extra notation at all. With the Pythagorean assumption, there will be notation to account for the three syntonic commas that would be needed to play the scale in tune, which would have to be explained later. It&apos;s just a bit more cluttered at the start, and possibly unnecessarily.</p><p>To learn any just intonation system, that C major scale will have to be aurally memorized, so that the musician knows exactly where those notes are on their instrument or in their voice and how they sound in relation to the other notes of the same scale. They are going to learn the sound of the 5-limit scale no matter how it&apos;s actually notated. It just seems to me to be better to start the notation there as well simply because of how I expect people to learn it. Then, adding the accidentals only modifies exactly what the musician knows by ear from the beginning, not based on the Pythagorean scale which is more difficult to pinpoint aurally.</p><p>Obviously, I&apos;m talking about playing on any instrument capable of very fine pitch-adjustment. Keyboards wouldn&apos;t matter; the key is pounded and a pitch comes out and it isn&apos;t up to the performer on those instruments how well in-tune those pitches are.

All they would want is how to adjust the pitch based on what they already know.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Around 4 years ago Dave Keenan and I took a close look at the Johnston notation.  In our discussion we referred to the explanation and specific examples in David Doty&apos;s Just Intonation Primer, available from: <a href="http://www.justintonation.net/primer1.html">http://www.justintonation.net/primer1.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dave K. was in complete agreement with all of my observations, which I quote here in full, along with other comments I&apos;ve added [in square brackets] for clarification:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; Now that I&apos;ve had a chance to look at it, I&apos;m amazed at how many things I can find to fault, without even counting the false D-to-A fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just my Sagittal-arrow orientation, but I find it counter-intuitive that the 7 accidental (which not only seems to point *upward* but also sits *atop* the sharp and flat signs in Figures 5.1b and 5.2) actually *lowers* the pitch (by 32:35) and the inverted 7 (which not only seems to point *downward* but also sits *below* the sharp and flat signs in Figure 5.1b) actually *raises* the pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [This is a matter of cosmetics rather than semantics and not a serious problem.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) In Figure 5.2 (the only diagram showing the symbols on a staff), the horizontal component of the +, -, 7, and inverted 7 signs tends to get lost when it gets too close to a staff line (see 32/27 on the 6th staff). The - sign is completely lost, and it&apos;s also rather difficult to distinguish an inverted 7 from a double-inverted 7 (see 8/7 vs. 64/49 and 12/7 vs. 64/49 on the bottom staff).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Dave noted that this could be remedied by a properly designed font, e.g., something along the lines of our Sagittal-Wilson symbols could replace + - .]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) Multiple accidentals make the size of the cumulative alteration difficult to estimate, particularly when they point in opposite directions.  In Figure 5.1b, in the second plane down, the symbol in the upper right corner is:<br/>&gt; A77++ (for 6615/4096)<br/>&gt; Relative to C (taking into account the need to decrease five&apos;s exponent by 1, since the nominal is A) this translates to [ 3, 1, 2 &gt;, which is<br/>&gt; Ab&apos;~|) and A&apos;~~!! in Sagittal herculean &amp; olympian, or<br/>&gt; Ab/|~ and A||~ promethean, or<br/>&gt; Ab(|( and A~||( athenian.<br/>&gt; With Sagittal, the flags at least give you a general idea of the amount of alteration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [The Sagittal symbols for JI in the higher-than-athenian levels are admittedly rather unusual and/or complicated, but this is to be expected if you want to distinguish a complicated ratio from a simpler one with a separate symbol.  The herculean, promethean, and (especially) athenian levels of precision re-use symbols for simpler ratios to notate more complicated ratios, thereby allowing the composer to choose among several different levels of notational complexity.  (Athenian-level symbols are guaranteed to get you within 5.4 cents of the desired pitch of a complex ratio, and in the overwhelming majority of cases within 2 cents.  All reasonably simple 11-limit ratios are notated exactly.)  The point I was making is that, unlike Sagittal symbols, laterally &quot;stacked&quot; Johnston symbols often require mental gymnastics to determine the total amount of alteration.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) The C-centric 5-comma breaks in the chain-of-fifths nominals increase the number of irregularities in interpreting ratios when one goes above the 5-limit; e.g., 7/4 of C is Bb7, whereas 7/4 of G is F7+, 7/4 of A is G7, and 7/4 of B is A7+.  With Sagittal you can usually determine the prime factors in the ratio from the accidental, without taking the nominal into account. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Those instances in which the nominal must be taken into account involve cases in which the same symbol is used for two different ratios differing by a very small amount, e.g., 35:36 (7-limit, 48.770 c) vs. 1024:1053 (13-limit, 48.348 c).  In such cases, the intended ratio is easily determined by the musical context.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [End of quote]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A further point to consider is that stacked Johnston symbols do not seem very suitable for notating temperaments.  Dave &amp; I gave issues such as these a lot of thought as we sought (over the course of several years!) to define a single set of symbols that could notate virtually any tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andrew, for these reasons I hope you will take the time to give the Sagittal system serious consideration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2012 9:48:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh, and on the .PDF file I downloaded from the website describing Sagittal mechanics, there is a typo on page 9.

Yes, unless the base C major scale is Pythagorean, the chain of fifths is broken. But I&apos;m not convinced that the fifths need to be pure for people to be able to read the music.

Sagittal is based on F-C-G-D-A-E-B being identical fifths. If you make that the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale instead, then you&apos;re not using Sagittal.

And Saggital looks like it will work in either case, either with the Pythagoream or the 5-limit C major scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not sure what you mean by this. Sagittal is based on F-C-G-D-A-E-B being identical fifths. If you make that the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale instead, then you&apos;re not using Sagittal. (Sagittal gurus please correct me if I&apos;m wrong.)</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s correct.  Although you would be using Sagittal symbols, you wouldn&apos;t be using them in the way they were intended to be used.  The Sagittal system was designed to notate JI so that (on a conventional staff) there would be a correlation between the prime factors in a ratio and the Sagittal accidental used to notate that ratio.  Thus a 5-comma-down symbol \! indicates that there&apos;s a 5-factor (and no other prime &lt;5) in the ratio, and a 7-comma-down symbol !) that there&apos;s a 7-factor (and no other prime &lt;5) in the ratio, etc.  (There are also symbols for combinations of primes &gt;3 that can be memorized fairly easily.)</p><p>Now let&apos;s notate a &quot;just&quot; G major scale in this manner:<br/>G  A  B\!  C  D  E\!  F!!\  G<br/>It&apos;s immediately evident that the fifth A to E\! is a comma narrower than just and the minor 3rd A to C is pythagorean (i.e., a comma narrower than just), so replacing the A (9/8 of G) with A\! (10/9 of G) will give you a just minor triad A\! C E\! -- and this is valid in all keys!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Which is really cool. Great job in developing this, by the way. It definitely took a lot of work.</p><p>It was more work than you could ever imagine!  Dave Keenan &amp; I were both sticklers for details and didn&apos;t always agree on things, but we were determined to keep at it until we had reached an agreement that we had gotten it right.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Someone who has never seen microtonal notation before (such someones would be the vast, vast majority of musicians) would want the initial presentation to be as simple as possible. This usually means &apos;how do I play a scale, and what does it look like?&apos; With the 5-limit assumption of C major, the player would simply play the scale as it sounds in-tune to them at the moment, and there is no extra notation at all. With the Pythagorean assumption, there will be notation to account for the three syntonic commas that would be needed to play the scale in tune, which would have to be explained later. It&apos;s just a bit more cluttered at the start, and possibly unnecessarily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This reasoning is based on an incorrect assumption. If a musician is &quot;playing the scale as it sounds in-tune to them at the moment&quot;, even in a C major context, they&apos;re going to play a D-A double stop as 3/2, never 40/27. In other words &quot;playing the scale as it sounds in-tune to them at the moment&quot; does not refer to any specific JI scale, but to an adaptive JI rendition based on a &quot;smart&quot; interpretation of the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If some particular musician *DID* already have the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale memorized and internalized, then what you&apos;re saying would make perfect sense, but I&apos;m sure this is not true for the vast majority of musicians. &quot;A major scale that sounds in-tune&quot; is certainly not identical with &quot;the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To learn any just intonation system, that C major scale will have to be aurally memorized, so that the musician knows exactly where those notes are on their instrument or in their voice and how they sound in relation to the other notes of the same scale. They are going to learn the sound of the 5-limit scale no matter how it&apos;s actually notated. It just seems to me to be better to start the notation there as well simply because of how I expect people to learn it. Then, adding the accidentals only modifies exactly what the musician knows by ear from the beginning, not based on the Pythagorean scale which is more difficult to pinpoint aurally.</p><p>You&apos;re not really doing anyone a favor by making something simpler in the short run if it results in its being much more complicated in the long run.  If you want to make it simple at the very first, then leave off the microtonal accidentals at first until the supertonic false fifth is encountered, at which point the student will understand the need for the comma-accidental.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Obviously, I&apos;m talking about playing on any instrument capable of very fine pitch-adjustment. Keyboards wouldn&apos;t matter; the key is pounded and a pitch comes out and it isn&apos;t up to the performer on those instruments how well in-tune those pitches are. It&apos;s all set up beforehand and they&apos;re stuck with what they got.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Essentially, I&apos;m saying that I&apos;m not sure if it even matters for performers if every fifth is perfect and every major second is exactly the same and so on in the notation. All they would want is how to adjust the pitch based on what they already know.</p><p>&gt; All of this would make perfect sense, except that &quot;what they already know&quot; is almost guaranteed not to be the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale. In most cases, &quot;what they already know&quot; is somewhere in the spectrum between 12-equal and an adaptive JI rendition deviating from a base framework of meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re making it sound as if starting from the Ptolemy major scale is completely natural and intuitive, and starting from Pythagorean is unnatural or unnecessarily complicated. In reality they are simply different choices each with their own drawbacks. If you start from Pythagorean you have to teach people that C-E is not 5/4; if you start from Ptolemy on C you have to teach people that D-A is not 3/2 and D-F is not 6/5. Pythagorean has the drawback that all ratios of 5 must have accidentals; but Ptolemy has the (to me more serious) drawback of being inconsistent with the logical chain-of-fifths transposition structure that people already know.</p><p>There&apos;s an additional thing to consider if you try to use the Johnston principle to notate temperaments and tempered tunings.  For meantone temperament (or tunings such as 19-equal or 31-equal, where the comma is distributed equally over the chain of fifths) there&apos;s no need for the 5-comma symbol, since the 5-comma (80:81) vanishes, so there&apos;s no problem.  But what about 72-equal?  With the Johnston method, 2/3 of the tones in the 12-equal circle would get microtonal accidentals, whereas with Sagittal the nominals (plus sharps or flats) notates the circle of 12 fifths without any microtonal accidentals (and the next lower circle of 12 fifths is notated by adding the \! Symbol).</p><p>Sure, Johnston notation was intended only for JI, but that&apos;s just my point.  Why use a notation limited only to JI when you can have one that will do it all (and, for that matter, do it better!) in a consistent manner?</p><p>Andrew, since the way you&apos;ve described introducing the scale to your students sounds very much like adaptive JI, you may want to consider presenting the pitches as two circles of 12 fifths a comma apart (i.e., as a subset of 72-equal), using the 5-comma-down symbol to indicate the tones that need to be adjusted downward in pitch to get closer to pure thirds &amp; sixths.  Another advantage is that the \! alteration in 72-equal is only about 3/4 of what&apos;s required in strict JI.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>kraiggrady@...</h3><span>3/14/2012 11:26:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The 5-limit notated in Saggital preserves Helmholtz&apos;s notation it appears.

F!!\  G<br/>&gt; It&apos;s immediately evident that the fifth A to E\! is a comma narrower than just and the minor 3rd A to C is pythagorean (i.e., a comma narrower than just), so replacing the A (9/8 of G) with A\! (10/9 of G) will give you a just minor triad A\! C E\! -- and this is valid in all keys!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Which is really cool. Great job in developing this, by the way. It definitely took a lot of work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was more work than you could ever imagine!  Dave Keenan &amp; I were both sticklers for details and didn&apos;t always agree on things, but we were determined to keep at it until we had reached an agreement that we had gotten it right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone who has never seen microtonal notation before (such someones would be the vast, vast majority of musicians) would want the initial presentation to be as simple as possible. This usually means &apos;how do I play a scale, and what does it look like?&apos; With the 5-limit assumption of C major, the player would simply play the scale as it sounds in-tune to them at the moment, and there is no extra notation at all. With the Pythagorean assumption, there will be notation to account for the three syntonic commas that would be needed to play the scale in tune, which would have to be explained later. It&apos;s just a bit more cluttered at the start, and possibly unnecessarily.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This reasoning is based on an incorrect assumption. If a musician is &quot;playing the scale as it sounds in-tune to them at the moment&quot;, even in a C major context, they&apos;re going to play a D-A double stop as 3/2, never 40/27. In other words &quot;playing the scale as it sounds in-tune to them at the moment&quot; does not refer to any specific JI scale, but to an adaptive JI rendition based on a &quot;smart&quot; interpretation of the music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If some particular musician *DID* already have the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale memorized and internalized, then what you&apos;re saying would make perfect sense, but I&apos;m sure this is not true for the vast majority of musicians. &quot;A major scale that sounds in-tune&quot; is certainly not identical with &quot;the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To learn any just intonation system, that C major scale will have to be aurally memorized, so that the musician knows exactly where those notes are on their instrument or in their voice and how they sound in relation to the other notes of the same scale. They are going to learn the sound of the 5-limit scale no matter how it&apos;s actually notated. It just seems to me to be better to start the notation there as well simply because of how I expect people to learn it. Then, adding the accidentals only modifies exactly what the musician knows by ear from the beginning, not based on the Pythagorean scale which is more difficult to pinpoint aurally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re not really doing anyone a favor by making something simpler in the short run if it results in its being much more complicated in the long run.  If you want to make it simple at the very first, then leave off the microtonal accidentals at first until the supertonic false fifth is encountered, at which point the student will understand the need for the comma-accidental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously, I&apos;m talking about playing on any instrument capable of very fine pitch-adjustment. Keyboards wouldn&apos;t matter; the key is pounded and a pitch comes out and it isn&apos;t up to the performer on those instruments how well in-tune those pitches are. It&apos;s all set up beforehand and they&apos;re stuck with what they got.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, I&apos;m saying that I&apos;m not sure if it even matters for performers if every fifth is perfect and every major second is exactly the same and so on in the notation. All they would want is how to adjust the pitch based on what they already know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All of this would make perfect sense, except that &quot;what they already know&quot; is almost guaranteed not to be the Ptolemy 5-limit major scale. In most cases, &quot;what they already know&quot; is somewhere in the spectrum between 12-equal and an adaptive JI rendition deviating from a base framework of meantone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;re making it sound as if starting from the Ptolemy major scale is completely natural and intuitive, and starting from Pythagorean is unnatural or unnecessarily complicated. In reality they are simply different choices each with their own drawbacks. If you start from Pythagorean you have to teach people that C-E is not 5/4; if you start from Ptolemy on C you have to teach people that D-A is not 3/2 and D-F is not 6/5. Pythagorean has the drawback that all ratios of 5 must have accidentals; but Ptolemy has the (to me more serious) drawback of being inconsistent with the logical chain-of-fifths transposition structure that people already know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s an additional thing to consider if you try to use the Johnston principle to notate temperaments and tempered tunings.  For meantone temperament (or tunings such as 19-equal or 31-equal, where the comma is distributed equally over the chain of fifths) there&apos;s no need for the 5-comma symbol, since the 5-comma (80:81) vanishes, so there&apos;s no problem.  But what about 72-equal?  With the Johnston method, 2/3 of the tones in the 12-equal circle would get microtonal accidentals, whereas with Sagittal the nominals (plus sharps or flats) notates the circle of 12 fifths without any microtonal accidentals (and the next lower circle of 12 fifths is notated by adding the \! Symbol).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, Johnston notation was intended only for JI, but that&apos;s just my point.  Why use a notation limited only to JI when you can have one that will do it all (and, for that matter, do it better!) in a consistent manner?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andrew, since the way you&apos;ve described introducing the scale to your students sounds very much like adaptive JI, you may want to consider presenting the pitches as two circles of 12 fifths a comma apart (i.e., as a subset of 72-equal), using the 5-comma-down symbol to indicate the tones that need to be adjusted downward in pitch to get closer to pure thirds &amp; sixths.  Another advantage is that the \! alteration in 72-equal is only about 3/4 of what&apos;s required in strict JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2012 12:49:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Speaking of Sagigtal notation, I have another question which, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with music or notation.</p><p>What is the legal status of Sagittal notation?
