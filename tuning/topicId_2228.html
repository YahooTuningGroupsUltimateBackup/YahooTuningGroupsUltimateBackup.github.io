The differences are probably<br/>because I &gt;assumed octave-equivalence and Tenney didn&apos;t.</p><p>I don&apos;t have any references on Tenney, other than Divisions of a<br/>Tetrachord.  Also, do you have a new algorithm that reflects your new<br/>rectangular, octave-specific way?</p><p>&gt;&gt;The shortest-route metrics are equivalent to change-making problems.  What<br/>&gt;&gt;is the least number of coins you can use to make 33 cents change?  Forget a<br/>&gt;&gt;quarter, nickel, and three pennies, Erlich mints a 33-cent piece on the<br/>&gt;&gt;spot!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Eh?</p><p>A shortest-route triangular-lattice metric says &quot;at the octave-equivalent<br/>7-limit, 35/24 is made of a 7/6 and a 5/4&quot;.  So the customer (listener) is<br/>burdened with two coins in his pocket (ear).  The rectangular-lattice<br/>version of this would be 7/4 plus 2/3 plus 5/4, so the customer has 3<br/>coins.  I prefer the triangular version because I consider 7/6 a primary<br/>consonant interval at the 7-limit.</p><p>Your log of odd limit, while more accurately measuring dyadic dissonance,<br/>only measures shortest routes when the odd-limit is infinity (coins of any<br/>denomination are accepted).  Thus 35/24 is represented by one coin.  I<br/>don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve done to it since you got hot on octave-specifics,<br/>but your orginal algorithm assumed a triangular lattice (in the above<br/>example, the /3 was in the coin).</p><p>Carl</p></div>
