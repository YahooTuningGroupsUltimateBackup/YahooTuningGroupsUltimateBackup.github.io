(Seven years after the Daddy&#xFFFD;s franchise opened shop two doors<br/>down.)</p><p>**This is entirely contingent on the guitar being a jumbo.</p><p>***While the setup and tuning time was certainly not instant; it was indeed<br/>&#xFFFD;quick&#xFFFD;... And no matter what you did to this particular guitar (short of a<br/>major overhaul), any intonation was going to be &#xFFFD;dirty&#xFFFD;.</p><p>****You could also stop the bridge incrementally between 11 - 15... a good<br/>ways before 11... and a bit after 15.<br/>__________________________________________________________</p><p>No. 4<br/>JI and the Insolvent Guitarist</p><p>This is a DIY* method I&#xFFFD;ve used to experiment with ratio tunings** that<br/>require fretlets (i.e. individual stops that rest under a single string). As<br/>this is meant to address both the desire to try a lot of differing ratio<br/>scenarios, and an inability to afford anything vaguely resembling a real JI<br/>custom job&#xFFFD;</p><p>Any guitar costing upwards of 75$ should be immediately and permanently<br/>dislodged from this discussion: tout-de-suite! (I used a 35$ Zim-Gar nylon<br/>string&#xFFFD;)</p><p>Mini-staples, or staple tots are the rather enfeebled munitions of miniature<br/>staplers. They were also ratio stops on the Zim-Gar.</p><p>A couple of forewarnings gleaned from trial and tribulation:</p><p>1) You will certainly benefit from some reliable form of pitch reference<br/>(such as a tunable keyboard***). For it has been my experience that the<br/>intentional accuracy of (mathematically precise) string ratios fluctuate<br/>quite a bit more than one might anticipate - especially on inexpensive<br/>guitars.</p><p>2) Before you start taking the strings off (or loosening the string tension)<br/>to start tapping in the faux fretlets, you might want to lightly mark the<br/>entire horizontal run of the strings down the fingerboard to best<br/>approximate where the fretlets should sit (as the strings fan out from the<br/>nut to the bridge).</p><p>3) To fine-tune and (fine) mark the intervals, I bend a paper clip at the<br/>shoulder and (with the guitar lying on its back) slide the straight section<br/>under the string. This serves the dual purpose of being both [potentially&#xFFFD;]<br/>very precise, and ready-made for making a straight line.</p><p>4) With the greatest of care (and the most tolerant of temperaments!), the<br/>mini-staples will hammer straight into the fretboard. But as this is<br/>somewhat akin to Kwai Chang walking on rice paper, sooner or later your<br/>bound to start twisting, buckling, and crumpling a few of them over&#xFFFD; With a<br/>combination of luck, will, and practice, attempt to discourage them from<br/>folding towards the headstock or the soundhole&#xFFFD; If they have crumpled within<br/>earshot of their destination: Start hammering. This will smooth out (smash<br/>in) any crimps or crinkles.</p><p>5) I found that stopping heptads**** and other perhaps less ambitious tuning<br/>scenarios,***** makes the process of pulling them all out and sanding down<br/>the damage (so you can start all over again******), a far less dispiriting<br/>devoir.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Dan Stearns</p><p>*Perhaps &quot;Did It Myself&quot; (dim indeed!) is more appropriate here, as I&#xFFFD;m not<br/>so sure this (Neanderthal) method constitutes the soundest advise&#xFFFD;<br/>Nevertheless&#xFFFD;It does work.</p><p>**I&#xFFFD;ve also used this to &#xFFFD;freely&#xFFFD; stop intervals of my own liking. (Tuned by<br/>listening until I found something I deemed &#xFFFD;attractive&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;)</p><p>***I also tune the adjacent open string to a unison of the open string I&#xFFFD;m<br/>marking ratios for, as it seems to me that I can sometimes &#xFFFD;hear&#xFFFD; the<br/>interval &#xFFFD;better&#xFFFD; against a 1/1 of the same (timbre) species. But this is<br/>really a rather limited sort of double-check that won&#xFFFD;t help you much in<br/>distinguishing a 15/14 from a 16/15, and as 1/15th or 1/16th the distance<br/>from the nut to the saddle may or may not stop a 15/14 or a 16/15... the use<br/>of a reliable pitch reference is highly desirable.</p><p>****The last tuning I used on the (now deceased) Zim-Gar was the main tuning<br/>(1/1, 8/7, 9/7, 7/5, 32/21, 12/7, 27/14, 2/1) I was using to rework an older<br/>arrangement I had done of Lowell Mason&#xFFFD;s &#xFFFD;Work For the Night is Coming&#xFFFD;.<br/>This tuning is featured in the second verse. (In a sort of polymodal style,<br/>where the guitars take G as the 1/1, and the tenor holds D as the 1/1; G, A,<br/>B, C#, D, E, F#, G and D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D respectfully.) The guitar<br/>was tuned:</p><p>E @ 12/7 (+ 4/3 =)<br/>A @ 8/7 (+ 4/3 =)<br/>D @ 32/21 (+ 21/16 =)<br/>G @ 1/1 (+ 9/7 =)<br/>B @ 9/7 (+ 4/3 =)<br/>E @ 12/7</p><p>*****However it is possible (hit or miss, as sometimes the dips and bends of<br/>the neck coincide with your desires and sometimes they don&#xFFFD;t) to place stops<br/>quite close to each other&#xFFFD; In fact I&#xFFFD;d say as close as your probably apt to<br/>&#xFFFD;fret&#xFFFD;. (Which is somewhat different than &#xFFFD;play&#xFFFD;, as on a fretless guitar<br/>you can very subtly roll your finger to achieve wonderfully infinitesimal<br/>gradations of pitch inflection.)</p><p>******As you may want to reutilize some of the same intervals (of which the<br/>octave row would serve as an obvious example), before you start extracting<br/>the staples, it&#xFFFD;s best to have some idea of what you would like to try<br/>[fret] next.</p><p>Ps&#xFFFD;Should your fretboard cleave in half and your truss rod roll to the<br/>floor&#xFFFD; I reserve the right to deny ever having written any of this.<br/>__________________________________________________________</p><p>No. 5<br/>WHERE F + f = O</p><p>A (factitious*) &quot;two and only two sizes&quot; for every 1 - ?

I (for whatever that&#xFFFD;s worth) certainly<br/>&gt; would have found the shrillness of the intonation reform minded rhetoric<br/>&gt; nearly unendurable had the music been some underwhelming, imaginatively<br/>&gt; anemic quotidian&#xFFFD;&quot;Natural, reasonable, and inherently pleasing&quot; or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would one with alternative tuning inclinations truly find an unanticipated<br/>&gt; audio encounter with an instrument such as Ivor Darreg&#xFFFD;s Megalyra any less<br/>&gt; &#xFFFD;impressive&#xFFFD; or &#xFFFD;interesting&#xFFFD; were it tuned to (and played in) 12<br/>&gt; equidistant divisions of the octave? Would the same go for a DX7...?  Or to<br/>&gt; put another way: Does a compilation like EMI&#xFFFD;s 1st &#xFFFD;GRAVICHORDS, WHIRLIES<br/>&gt; AND PYROPHONES&#xFFFD; make a better &#xFFFD;argument&#xFFFD; for the design and implementation<br/>&gt; of interesting new instruments than a compilation like the tuning forums &#xFFFD;A<br/>&gt; MICROTONAL MUSIC EXPERIENCE&#xFFFD; does for the design and implementation of<br/>&gt; interesting new tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the end I would suppose that the &#xFFFD;divinity&apos; is either there, or it ain&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt; t&#xFFFD;quite regardless of whether it is in the gross tactical bone and marrow of<br/>&gt; the procedure (or it ain&#xFFFD;t)&#xFFFD; and ultimately that it&#xFFFD;s more or less for each<br/>&gt; to say&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As if its not clear by now&#xFFFD;I profoundly disagree with many of the<br/>&gt; ideological declarations of the [arch] remedial minded &#xFFFD;intonationalist&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;For me Partch&apos;s message about primitive man is important, and not so nearly<br/>&gt; as important as his contribution to tuning in music.&quot; [C.

As<br/>&gt; this is meant to address both the desire to try a lot of differing ratio<br/>&gt; scenarios, and an inability to afford anything vaguely resembling a real JI<br/>&gt; custom job&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any guitar costing upwards of 75$ should be immediately and permanently<br/>&gt; dislodged from this discussion: tout-de-suite! (I used a 35$ Zim-Gar nylon<br/>&gt; string&#xFFFD;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mini-staples, or staple tots are the rather enfeebled munitions of miniature<br/>&gt; staplers. They were also ratio stops on the Zim-Gar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A couple of forewarnings gleaned from trial and tribulation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) You will certainly benefit from some reliable form of pitch reference<br/>&gt; (such as a tunable keyboard***). For it has been my experience that the<br/>&gt; intentional accuracy of (mathematically precise) string ratios fluctuate<br/>&gt; quite a bit more than one might anticipate - especially on inexpensive<br/>&gt; guitars.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Before you start taking the strings off (or loosening the string tension)<br/>&gt; to start tapping in the faux fretlets, you might want to lightly mark the<br/>&gt; entire horizontal run of the strings down the fingerboard to best<br/>&gt; approximate where the fretlets should sit (as the strings fan out from the<br/>&gt; nut to the bridge).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) To fine-tune and (fine) mark the intervals, I bend a paper clip at the<br/>&gt; shoulder and (with the guitar lying on its back) slide the straight section<br/>&gt; under the string. This serves the dual purpose of being both [potentially&#xFFFD;]<br/>&gt; very precise, and ready-made for making a straight line.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) With the greatest of care (and the most tolerant of temperaments!), the<br/>&gt; mini-staples will hammer straight into the fretboard. But as this is<br/>&gt; somewhat akin to Kwai Chang walking on rice paper, sooner or later your<br/>&gt; bound to start twisting, buckling, and crumpling a few of them over&#xFFFD; With a<br/>&gt; combination of luck, will, and practice, attempt to discourage them from<br/>&gt; folding towards the headstock or the soundhole&#xFFFD; If they have crumpled within<br/>&gt; earshot of their destination: Start hammering. This will smooth out (smash<br/>&gt; in) any crimps or crinkles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5) I found that stopping heptads**** and other perhaps less ambitious tuning<br/>&gt; scenarios,***** makes the process of pulling them all out and sanding down<br/>&gt; the damage (so you can start all over again******), a far less dispiriting<br/>&gt; devoir.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Respectfully,<br/>&gt; Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Perhaps &quot;Did It Myself&quot; (dim indeed!) is more appropriate here, as I&#xFFFD;m not<br/>&gt; so sure this (Neanderthal) method constitutes the soundest advise&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt; Nevertheless&#xFFFD;It does work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; **I&#xFFFD;ve also used this to &#xFFFD;freely&#xFFFD; stop intervals of my own liking.

But this is<br/>&gt; really a rather limited sort of double-check that won&#xFFFD;t help you much in<br/>&gt; distinguishing a 15/14 from a 16/15, and as 1/15th or 1/16th the distance<br/>&gt; from the nut to the saddle may or may not stop a 15/14 or a 16/15... the use<br/>&gt; of a reliable pitch reference is highly desirable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****The last tuning I used on the (now deceased) Zim-Gar was the main tuning<br/>&gt; (1/1, 8/7, 9/7, 7/5, 32/21, 12/7, 27/14, 2/1) I was using to rework an older<br/>&gt; arrangement I had done of Lowell Mason&#xFFFD;s &#xFFFD;Work For the Night is Coming&#xFFFD;.<br/>&gt; This tuning is featured in the second verse. (In a sort of polymodal style,<br/>&gt; where the guitars take G as the 1/1, and the tenor holds D as the 1/1; G, A,<br/>&gt; B, C#, D, E, F#, G and D, E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D respectfully.)
