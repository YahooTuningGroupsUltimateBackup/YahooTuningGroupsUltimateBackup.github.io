West and David Levy<br/>(?), have grave doubts on the U.C, Berkeley interpretation of the<br/>Babylonian notation and the Hurrian Cult song transcription. West<br/>believes the notation refers to notes played on the harp with both<br/>hands, not chords as the Berkeley group believes.</p><p>In any case, the tuning tablets make it clear that the Babylonians and<br/>related civilizations used &quot;Pythagorean&quot; tuning by the late 3rd and<br/>early 2nd millennia BCE and not 5-limit or proto-12-tet.</p><p>I think it is premature to infer musical universals from such dubious<br/>and fragmentary evidence, but I&apos;m becoming curmudgeonly these days.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/9/1999 6:53:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 11/09/1999 03:41:42 PM, <a href="mailto:jhchalmers@popmail.ucsd.edu">jhchalmers@popmail.ucsd.edu</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;I think it is premature to infer musical universals from such dubious<br/>&gt;and fragmentary evidence</p><p>    IMHO, I do not think there are any definitive &quot;musical universals&quot; to<br/>begin with.<br/>    History is full of &quot;culturicides&quot; &amp; cross-cultural pollinations; this<br/>maybe<br/>a factor - amongst several - in the superfacial semblance of musical<br/>universals.<br/>    Hopefully 12 TET is not gonna be a musical universal at the expense of<br/>other scale systems... but at the rate of techno-cultural/EuroAmericanized<br/>Globalization - pushed by the &quot;Hidden Hand&quot; of Capitalism, 12 TET may become<br/>a musical universal (if it hasn&apos;t already).  =(</p><p>zHANg</p></div>
