The trick is to cut grooves for 154-EDO, i.e. 154 fret positions to the octave, with the saddles at the middle of their travel. Then by moving the saddles toward the nut we can cause first the 153rd and then the 152nd fret poition to become the octave position (approx halfway between saddle and nut) and by moving the saddles away from the nut we can cause the 155th and 156th fret positions to become the octave.</p><p>If you look at this list of 5 consecutive large EDOs you will find the following popular subsets.</p><p>152  Every 8th position gives 19-EDO<br/>153  Every 9th position gives 17-EDO<br/>154  Every 7th position gives 22-ED0<br/>155  Every 5th position gives 31-EDO<br/>156  Every 13th position gives 12-EDO</p><p>152  also supports 5-limit JI to high precision and gives near-11-limit-JI.</p><p>Complete list of EDOs supported exactly:<br/>5&#x9;6&#x9;7&#x9;8&#x9;9&#x9;11&#x9;12&#x9;13&#x9;14&#x9;17&#x9;19&#x9;22&#x9;26&#x9;31&#x9;38&#x9;39&#x9;51&#x9;52&#x9;76&#x9;77&#x9;78&#x9;152&#x9;153&#x9;154&#x9;155&#x9;156</p><p>Perhaps someone can generate a list of all the notable linear temperaments that are thereby supported.</p><p>All these available on the one instrument just by re-wrapping the fretline and adjusting the saddles! I hasten to add that such an instrument doesn&apos;t yet exist. There are a number of problems still to be solved.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
