But as I read it Isacoff did claim that Bach &quot;preferred&quot; equal temperament, and his strongest argument was that in the WTC he would notate a prelude in Eb minor and its fugue in D#, as if to say, &quot;See? Eb and D# are really the same note!&quot; But of course that only proves he wasn&apos;t thinking in meantone, not unequal well temperament - it&apos;s no argument at all, and proves Isacoff really, truly, deeply, doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about. Except for the quizzical last four pages, in which he suddenly seems to contradict everything he&apos;s said, Isacoff argues that 12tet is the only tuning we&apos;ll ever need. And because I argued that other tunings have value as well and should be allowed to flourish, he called me &quot;an ideologue for whom only one way of doing things can be correct.&quot; It&apos;s true: I&apos;m dogmatically committed to diversity and variety, and just can&apos;t see any acceptable alternative to freedom.</p><p>Now he calls me and my ilk (which presumably includes people on this list, since others here criticized him for long lists of flagrant historical inaccuracies) the &quot;Tuning Taliban.&quot; Obviously a very petulant, immature, and easily threatened man. Since it&apos;s kind of old history, I append my review of the book, along with his breathtakingly disingenuous and back-pedaling reply.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p><p>Leaving Well Enough Alone<br/>By Kyle Gann<br/>Stuart Isacoff Argues an End-of-History Approach to Tuning</p><p>&#x9;Champions of the status quo find a particularly warm welcome in today&apos;s America. The very title of Stuart Isacoff&apos;s book *Temperament: The Idea that Solved Music&apos;s Greatest Riddle* (Knopf) signals that the status quo is OK by *him*. Temperament means fudging the way we tune the pitches of the musical scale so that we have the capacity to play in all keys. By tempering pitches, we lose the mathematically pure intervals from which music originally arose. Isacoff presents plenty of evidence that losing those pure intervals, though as necessary as losing one&apos;s innocence or virginity, was still sad. &quot;To those who know better,&quot; he finds Sir Isaac Newton saying, &quot;equal temperament&apos;s compromised tuning is as ungrateful to the ear as &apos;soiled and faint colors are to the eye.&apos;&quot; But Isacoff&apos;s *tone* throughout hints that those historical figures who resisted equal temperament were all quaint fuddy-duddies, and that temperament is here to stay.<br/>&#x9;Actually, this erudite, entertaining, but unbelievably digressive little book ends up saying very little about its ostensive topic. There are no tuning charts, no calculations, no technical data of any kind: just a paean to the *idea* of putting the heady pleasure of all those pure overtones behind and settling into the middle-class respectability of fuzzy harmonies, wrapped with lots of Music of the Spheres philosophy and Renaissance sexual anecdotes. And although there are many kinds of temperament offering a wide array of musical colors - Werckmeister, Kirnberger, Young, to name a few 18th-century brands - Isacoff cavalierly brushes them aside as variants of his hero equal temperament (the equal spacing of the 12 pitches of the scale, universal only since the early 20th century), calling it the &quot;philosophical ideal&quot; to which all the others secretly aspired. &quot;The general acceptance of equal temperament,&quot; he enthuses, &quot;led to some of the most exquisite music ever written.&quot;<br/>&#x9;Well, we hear this argument a lot. Discontinue equal temperament, and all that Great European Music goes out the window, right? But it&apos;s not true. Bach wanted to be able to play in all keys, and would torture his organ tuner by playing in A-flat, the one key that sounded most sour in Baroque-era meantone tuning. But that&apos;s a long way from saying that all keys should sound identical, and all through the 18th and 19th centuries, they didn&apos;t. (Isacoff&apos;s evidence that Bach preferred equal temperament is worse than specious - no more than the fact that he&apos;ll notate a prelude in E-flat minor and its fugue in D-sharp.) Chopin milked the bitterness of early temperament&apos;s B-flat minor for his &quot;Funeral&quot; Sonata, and if equal temperament had triumphed in the 18th century, why did that century only offer one symphony in the key of F-sharp? It&apos;s Haydn&apos;s 45th, &quot;Farewell,&quot; and even that&apos;s in dark F-sharp minor, not the jarringly bright F-sharp major.<br/>&#x9;Certainly a tuning is justified by the great music written in it. But when classical mavens like Isacoff (editor of *Piano Today* magazine) talk about &quot;the most exquisite music ever written,&quot; it&apos;s a pretty good bet they mean the standard repertoire from Bach through Debussy. And doesn&apos;t the hoary age of that repertoire suggest that 12-pitch temperament hasn&apos;t done much for us lately? It&apos;s a terrible tuning for meditative minimalism and its variants. The automobile advanced civilization, but fossil fuels will be gone soon, and it will have outlived its usefulness. Likewise, those twelve blandly-tuned pitches are exhausted - no new harmonies there, very little nuance available that hasn&apos;t been done to death. Late in the century-before-last, Franz Liszt and Ferruccio Busoni were already pushing the neccessity of finer divisions of the scale. As Morton Feldman said, &quot;The Western tradition is strong only because its resources are so weak. You start pushing around those twelve tones, and you&apos;ll know what I mean.&quot;<br/>&#x9;In the last three pages of the book (not mentioning Harry Partch at all, and La Monte Young only once in passing), Isacoff describes hearing Michael Harrison play his own music on a just intonation piano. I&apos;ve played that piano in Harrison&apos;s studio, right next to an equal-tempered grand; you play the vividly specific, spine-chilling intervals on the just piano, and then everything sounds so bland and washed-out and arbitrary and disappointing on the conventionally tuned one. Following that experience, Isacoff casts complete doubt in his last words - &quot;Maybe Pythagoras was right after all&quot; - on the premise he&apos;d pursued for 230 pages. He could have gone back and rewritten the whole book. But if it had flouted the conventional wisdom rather than shore it up, he probably would have had to settle for a much smaller publisher.</p><p>KEYED OFF</p><p>I just finished reading Kyle Gann&apos;s review of my book, Temperament: The Idea That Solved Music&apos;s Greatest Riddle [&quot;Leaving Well Enough Alone,&quot; February 5], and I couldn&apos;t resist responding, especially to his silly notion that if I disliked equal temperament I would &quot;probably have had to settle for a much smaller publisher.&quot; Does Gann really believe my editor at Knopf said, &quot;Hey, listen, we want to publish a book about musical temperament, but only if it supports the modern system&quot;? Conspiracy theories abound at the Voice, but this one must set some kind of record for ridiculousness. [Gann&apos;s comment: It&apos;s just so easy to get books on alternative tunings published, isn&apos;t it, guys?]</p><p>Gann admits that I present &quot;plenty of evidence&quot; in support of the value of older tunings. Indeed, though he claims my book &quot;brushed aside&quot; the uniqueness of different approaches, I actually celebrate their variety. For example, I call them the musical equivalents of poet Robert Frost&apos;s notion of a sentence, in which &quot;notes strung as melodies and harmonies became suffused with particular shades and shapes.&quot; But, since I also value equal temperament and the &quot;exquisite music&quot; that resulted from that system, Gann, a narrow-minded purveyor of the new, politically hip, anti-equal-temperament movement in music, feels the need to attack. Unlike Gann&apos;s review, my book is not a polemic, but the history of an idea. It presents the evolution of that idea by demonstrating links between developments in music, art, science, philosophy, religion, and societal mores. Along the way, it explores why people fought over these issues, and how we got to where we are.</p><p>I end Temperament with a question, bringing the narrative full circle to the tuning ideas of Pythagoras in the sixth century B.C.E. Gann thinks that means I should have gone back to the beginning and rewritten the whole thing. He misses the point, because he is an ideologue for whom only one way of doing things can be correct. I intentionally preserve the mystery inherent in this subject-the inability of anyone to arrive at a final answer.</p><p>Stuart Isacoff<br/>Bedford Hills, New York</p></div><h3><a id=45781 href="#45781">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>7/22/2003 8:32:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle, dare I say it, but I think you have Stuart wrong in some respects.

That being said, there is<br/>a tendency in the culture industry (pop culture) to randomly embrace outsiders when<br/>the political timing is right. It happened with African American vernacular culture over<br/>the past 50 years-- certainly this resulted in outlandish stereotyping and &apos;hipness<br/>backlash&apos;. Whenever something become suddenly hip, the outsiders who are suddenly<br/>insiders usually want to jump ship and move on to something else uncool...there is a<br/>certain prestige inherent in being an outsider (covert prestige). This process seems to<br/>be happening with gay American culture now too, especially since all the media<br/>attention with Lawrence vs. Texas.
