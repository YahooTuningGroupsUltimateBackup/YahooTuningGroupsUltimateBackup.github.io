It is an ancillary event in conjunction with the<br/>Other Minds festival in San Francisco.</p><p>For full information, see <a href="http://www.otherminds.org/">http://www.otherminds.org/</a></p><p>&quot;This year&apos;s festival takes place at the 1000 seat Palace of Fine Arts<br/>Theatre in Golden Gate Park. Symbolically, representing fine art in<br/>all aspects, a special feature of this Other Minds Festival 8 is a<br/>silent auction of the featured composers scores. These are<br/>fascinating documents, musically, historically and especially from an<br/>aesthetic sense.</p><p>Executive Director Charles Amirkhanian explains this opportunity, &quot;The<br/>scores of composers are a fascinating mix of graphics, mathematics,<br/>musical notations, invented symbols and visual art. Each one is a<br/>signed original and the styles vary wildly including everything from<br/>text to painting. These objects are both fascinating to look at and a<br/>gold mine for collectors and fans of contemporary music.&quot;</p><p>Available at reasonable prices, the scores have been contributed by<br/>composers Lou Harrison, Henry Brant, Pauline Oliveros, Annea Lockwood,<br/>Tania Le&oacute;n, Ricardo Tacuchian, Richard Teitelbaum, Takashi Harada,<br/>Ellen Fullman, and Randy Weston. These framed original works will be<br/>on exhibit in the foyer of the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre during the<br/>festival only.  All proceeds go to support Other Minds, Inc.&quot;</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
