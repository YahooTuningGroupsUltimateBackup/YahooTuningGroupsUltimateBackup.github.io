I was<br/>wondering if it would be possible to play back music directly from Finale in<br/>a different temperament through the internal MIDI...  that would be really<br/>great...  I was hoping that I could get some good answers, or suggestions on<br/>how to quickly get up and working with microtones...</p><p>Steven Kallstrom<br/><a href="mailto:skallstr@sun.iwu.edu">skallstr@sun.iwu.edu</a></p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/8/2001 2:51:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Steven Kallstrom&quot; &lt;skallstr@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello again,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;I have yet another question...

Thank you,</p><p>Hi Steven - I notice someone already answered you about Polya&apos;s counting<br/>theorem. By hand, cranking out the numbers is a pain in the neck, but you<br/>can get Maple or Mathematica to do it quite easily. If you want to<br/>actually see an example of a chord from each set-class, you can write a<br/>little code. I did it once for 19-tET and could probably dig up the<br/>C code if you&apos;re really interested. Anyway, here are the raw numbers for<br/>an example tuning, 31-tET, so you can get an idea of the magnitudes:</p><p>cardinality     number of set-classes<br/>0, 31                 1<br/>1, 30                 1<br/>2, 29                15<br/>3, 28                80<br/>4, 27               560<br/>5, 26              2793<br/>6, 25             12103<br/>7, 24             42640<br/>8, 23            127920<br/>9, 22            325845<br/>10, 21           716859<br/>11, 20          1367184<br/>12, 19          2278640<br/>13, 18          3329165<br/>14, 17          4280355<br/>15, 16          4850640</p><p>And I&apos;ll just add that I calculated the number of scales/chords of 26<br/>notes in 53-tet to be: 9183681736376. That&apos;s 9 trillion, 183 billion, 681<br/>million, 736 thousand and 376. I doubt we&apos;ll be seeing a 53-tet sequel to<br/>Slominsky&apos;s compendium of scales...</p><p>By the way, this question comes up periodically, and I suggest a FAQ<br/>entry: HOW MANY SCALES OR CHORDS ARE THERE IN A GIVEN EQUAL TEMPERAMENT?</p><p>The answer would contain a brief introduction to the notion of a<br/>set-class in an arbitrary tuning system, a description of the way you can<br/>count the scales/chords, and finally a table with the &quot;answers&quot;, i.e.<br/>numbers of set-classes of each cardinality, for all ETs up to some upper<br/>limit.</p><p>I don&apos;t post to the tuning list very often, but I&apos;d still be glad to<br/>contribute this FAQ entry if it&apos;s thought to be a good idea.</p><p>By the way, when I did a study of set-classes in 19-tET, I found it useful<br/>to group them in multiplicative classes. I.e., [0,1,2,3,4] &lt;-&gt; [0,2,4,6,8]<br/>&lt;-&gt; [0,3,6,9,12] &lt;-&gt; [0,4,8,12,16] &lt;-&gt; [0,1,5,10,15] &lt;-&gt; [0,5,6,12,18] &lt;-&gt;<br/>[0,2,7,9,14] &lt;-&gt; [0,5,8,13,16] &lt;-&gt; [0,8,9,17,18].  This reduces the number<br/>of distinct classes by a factor of almost 9, and makes it considerably<br/>easier to account for things.</p><p>As to the other question, of approaches to composition with set-classes, I<br/>would say that the approaches in books like Robert Morris&apos;s &quot;Composition<br/>with Pitch-classes&quot; are based on general principles, not tied to 12-tET.<br/>As for me, I&apos;m fascinated with the numbers of set-classes that come up,<br/>and the combinational principles, but I don&apos;t intentionally &quot;compose with<br/>set-classes&quot; and neither, I think, do most composers whose music gets<br/>analysed using set-classes.</p><p>Cheers --Jon Wild</p></div><h3>J Scott &#x3C;xjscott@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2001 10:33:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>Jon Wild:<br/>&gt; By the way, this question comes up periodically, and I suggest a<br/>&gt; FAQ entry: HOW MANY SCALES OR CHORDS ARE THERE IN A GIVEN EQUAL<br/>&gt; TEMPERAMENT?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t post to the tuning list very often, but I&apos;d still be<br/>&gt; glad to contribute this FAQ entry if it&apos;s thought to be a good<br/>&gt; idea.</p><p>Yes, please do!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
