Besides, it seems that this difference wouldn&acute;t exist since the stretched scale tuning inserts the adjustments mentioned in paragraph (4).</p><p>4 ) The frequency adjustments that are done in the middle octave and the remaining piano octaves to compensate the ear imperfection are practically assumed by the stretched scale.</p><p>This might be an alternate equal tempered tuning where all major thirds are 1.2607 which is about the same of 12 TET.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>Lima, April 26.<br/>piagui@...</p><p>__________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 5063 (20100426) __________</p><p>ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p><a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p></div>
