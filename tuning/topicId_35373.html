Maybe it is youth, maybe<br/>inexperience, but you should never have agreed to a performance of your piece<br/>under the conditions you described.  Why did the players play it?  &quot;Capable&quot;<br/>is low on the totem pole for a musical performance.  There are many things<br/>non-performer composers do not realize about what is involved in making a<br/>great performance.  Your judgment has come into question as the result of<br/>arrogantly declaring your abilities for 7 limit JI (though admittedly weak<br/>for 11 limit, by your account).  If you had used cents, you may have had a<br/>chance even without the rehearsals, and even if the players had never played<br/>microtonal music before.  Regardless, you are not credible based on your<br/>experiences regarding pronouncements on pitch accuracy and performing<br/>musicians.  I wish you success in your endeavors, and hope that you take a<br/>page from Socrates, admit to not knowing what you do not know.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2002 9:40:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; I am forced to disagree with you here.
