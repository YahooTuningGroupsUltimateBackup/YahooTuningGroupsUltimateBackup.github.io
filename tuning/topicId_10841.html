Or more accurately, I mis-&quot;thought.&quot;  It is, of<br/>&gt;course, the DOMINANT 7th chord I was talking about... Eb-G-Bb-Db, which<br/>&gt;was what you wanted me to try, with root, fifth and seventh on the black<br/>&gt;keys and the third, &quot;G,&quot; on the white key...</p><p>&gt;This was the one where there was virtually NO beating in your 12-22<br/>&gt;scale, compared to clearly audible beating in the 12t-ET version.</p><p>Well, unfortunately the tritone is still exactly the same as in 12-tET, and<br/>the fifth is much worse (being already nearly perfect in 12-tET). But the<br/>other four intervals in the chord, 5:4, 6:5, 7:6, and 7:4, are all better<br/>than in 12-tET.</p><p>&gt;So the experiment was really a striking success.</p><p>&gt;I also, just now, tried what, I believe, you are considering the<br/>&gt;&quot;mirror&quot;... E-G#-B-D, with the root, fifth and seventh on &quot;white&quot; keys<br/>&gt;and the third on a black...</p><p>That&apos;s not the mirror -- that one of the original dominant seventh chords I<br/>was talking about. The mirror is the half-diminished seventh, with the root,<br/>third, and seventh on one color, and the diminished fifth on another color.<br/>There are five possible roots for these, just as there are five possible<br/>roots for the really smooth &quot;dominant seventh&quot; chords including the two you<br/>found above.</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
