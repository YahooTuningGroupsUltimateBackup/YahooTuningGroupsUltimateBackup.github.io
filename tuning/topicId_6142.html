Chorus uses two channels.<br/>  When chorus is on, the number of available channels in the zone<br/>  will be cut in half. Chorus cannot be used with stereo samples.</p><p>Plus, zones can be transposed in 12-tET semitones.</p><p>The ESI can access up to 999 samples per bank arranged in up to 256 presets.<br/>16-parts, 64 voices, 19 filter types, 3 AHDSR envelopes, 1 multiwave LFO,<br/>A pair of submix outputs with integral returns in addition to a stereo<br/>output, &amp; SCSI.</p><p>Still, the voice architecture lags in a few areas in comparison to the<br/>Ensoniq ASR-X Pro. Particularly, the ASR&apos;s LFO can sync to rhythmic<br/>divisions of the sequence tempo or received MIDI clocks. Plus it has an<br/>additional &quot;Noise&quot; modulator.</p><p>The AST retails for @ US$1350 &amp; the ESI 4000 is @$900. The just released ESI<br/>2000 is supposed to be cheaper still. But the ASR includes a nifty<br/>sequencer, apparently (&amp; happily, for those who know the joys of analog<br/>style sequencing) modelled on analog sequencers, plus a powerful stereo efx<br/>processor. The ESI Turbo option (@$400) adds efx, but it&apos;s bogus in<br/>comparison to the ASR&apos;s efx. One could spend the $400 on any other efx proc.<br/>&amp; route it through the submix loops.</p><p>Later,<br/>Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Bid and sell for free at <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.com">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>John Loffink &#x3C;microtonal@xxxxxxxx.xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/1999 9:35:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;   From: &quot;Drew Skyfyre&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:skyfyre2@yahoo.com">skyfyre2@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: E-mu samplers are microtunable !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yup, the E-mu samplers CAN do microtunings.
