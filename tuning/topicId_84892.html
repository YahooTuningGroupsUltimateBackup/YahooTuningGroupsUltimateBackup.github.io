In other words, I straight harmonic series points to one root tone while something like mean-tone points to many (different ones based on the chord chosen).</p><p>I&apos;m a relative noob to this list still, but I always have personally<br/>thought that very way. I find writing a piece using exclusively the<br/>notes of the harmonic scale (let&apos;s say harmonics 8-16) to be extremely<br/>boring for this very reason. There&apos;s virtually zero root movement<br/>happening there. The meantone major scale does not have that same<br/>problem, and neither does the 5-limit JI major scale, although you<br/>might have to be creative and figure out comma shifts and so on.</p><p>&gt; Taking this into account here&apos;s the question: what experiments have been done involving tempering the harmonic series itself IE taking the scale<br/>&gt; 6:7:8:9:10:11:12(octave)<br/>&gt; and tempering each interval slightly (IE by up to 7 cents or so) to add tonal color?</p><p>I posted a while ago (search through the archives) some files that<br/>were 4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11 (with sines) but stretched or compressed evenly<br/>throughout the whole chord. At one point I flattened it so much that<br/>the 11:4 on the end actually became a perfect fourth plus an octave,<br/>and I compressed each other interval in the octad evenly to make it<br/>line up that way. The outer dyad still functioned as a 4:11 even<br/>though it was as flat as an 8:3, and it certainly did sound different<br/>than the raw 4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11. I think I preferred the stretched<br/>version to the flat one and in some cases even to the perfectly in<br/>tune one.</p><p>This would all change if sines weren&apos;t used. At that point, it would<br/>really start to depend on how much you care about beating, or whether<br/>you&apos;re willing to deal with more beating for the added benefit of<br/>having some more &quot;tonal color&quot; as you put it.</p><p>&gt; I suspect that the results could be more consonant than 5-limit JI and yet still keep the greater degree of tonal color offered by JI...but, of course, I&apos;m not sure if there are any loop-holes which would cause that to not happen. Any thoughts?</p><p>Haha... Let&apos;s not get in another 1000 page argument about what the<br/>word &quot;consonant&quot; means again. But I remember you posted a while ago<br/>your example where you compared a segment of the harmonic series to a<br/>very detuned sounding major scale from your experiments with phi... I<br/>certainly did like the detuned major scale a lot. You seem to be<br/>attracted to the sonic possibilities of purposefully detuning<br/>intervals for added color. I&apos;m not sure if it really had anything to<br/>do with phi, but it definitely was a very colorful sound, beating<br/>aside.</p><p>As for the theory behind things, I&apos;m still trying to figure out how<br/>&quot;tonal color&quot; and feeling and so on emerges from regular old &quot;in tune&quot;<br/>intervals (or even 12-tet). Figuring out what sonic effects purposely<br/>detuned intervals would have is way over my head. My involvement with<br/>detuning intervals generally sees them as an undesirable but necessary<br/>artefact of a temperament. But back in the days when the baroque crowd<br/>would post here, I remember some interesting stuff coming from Margo<br/>Schulter, Tom Dent, and so on about using purposefully wide and narrow<br/>thirds (I think Margo referred to them as &quot;neo-medieval&quot; or something<br/>like that) and what characters they had. You might be able to find<br/>some interesting stuff in the archives by searching for their posts,<br/>specifically Margo.</p><p>Other than that, I don&apos;t know of many people who are really all about<br/>purposefully detuning intervals, but that doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t be<br/>done or even codified into a theory. I say give it a shot.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=84902 href="#84902">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2009 9:38:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m renotating several of my Sims-Maneri pieces in<br/>&gt; HEWM-Sagittal to remedy these problems, which keep surfacing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe Pehrson</p><p>I&apos;m so glad to see this!

Well, he claims he can practice it over and over and then forgets what he&apos;s doing when he tries again.  Actually, I emphasize with him.  I think it&apos;s the large quarter tone sharps and flats that throw everything off, since they really are not directional at all.  I think the system works much better with the newer HEWM-Sagittal that several people worked on, on this list a few years ago, &quot;spearheaded&quot; (no pun intended:) by Sagittal masters George Secor and Dave Keenan...</p></div><h3><a id=84905 href="#84905">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2009 5:40:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Joe,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m renotating several of my Sims-Maneri pieces in<br/>&gt; &gt; HEWM-Sagittal to remedy these problems, which keep surfacing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joe Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m so glad to see this!

I thought I was going with a STANDARD, and that was important to me.  However in the intervening 6-7 years or so I have found performers who complain about the Sims-Maneri (no negative aspersions cast on the wonderful Joe Maneri, I can assure you) and the more I thought about it, it *is* really confusing.  It&apos;s the dumb-looking, large and non-directional quartertone symbols which throw everything off, in my view.  The HEWM-Sagittal is *much* more intuitive on the overall.  I agree with my recent performers:  it only takes a couple of goony symbols to throw off the entire thought and performance process!  Best to you!</p></div>
