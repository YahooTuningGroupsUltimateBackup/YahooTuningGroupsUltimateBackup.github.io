This would imply that 11/8 is half of 3/2.  Won&apos;t do at all.  How do<br/>you distinguish the 11/8 above 4 from the 16/11 above 6?</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;I have a problem with defining 13-limit intervals in 31-equal beacuse<br/>&gt;31-equal is only consistent through the 11-limit. This means that if you<br/>&gt;try to construct a harmonic series through the 13th partial on a<br/>&gt;31-equal instrument, you won&apos;t be able to use the best approximations of<br/>&gt;all 13-limit intervals that are available in 31-equal.</p><p>Okay, no problem, don&apos;t use *all* 13-limit intervals.  12 and 19 steps are<br/>the only &quot;large&quot; intervals in 31-equal that aren&apos;t 11-limit consonances, and<br/>they look more 13-limit than anything else.  My simple position is that if<br/>you have the 11-limit, the 13-limit comes bounding in on its coat tails<br/>because of the confusion between 18/11 and 13/8.  Whether this interval is<br/>really heard as a 13/8 is a question I find meaningless.  When the 13-limit<br/>intervals get very poor, that&apos;s no problem, because you&apos;ll get good 11-limit<br/>intervals instead.</p><p>I suppose I&apos;d better define &quot;large&quot;.  Obviously, as the smallest non-trivial<br/>11-limit interval is 12/11, no interval smaller than 12/11 can be in the<br/>11-limit until we get to the unison.  So 1, 2 and 3 steps in 31-equal<br/>obviously can&apos;t be 11-limit consonances.  Because of octave invariance and<br/>some other related concept, no interval between 11/6 and an octave can be an<br/>11-limit interval either.  So, that rules out 28, 29 and 30 steps.  All<br/>other intervals within an octave are the &quot;large&quot; ones.</p><p>I did try 11/8 and 13/8 last night.  Listening around the middle of the<br/>keyboard and with a clean brass sound, I preferred 11/8 to 13/8, but 18/11<br/>sounded even smoother.  18/11 seems to be at a minimum of dissonance of some<br/>kind.  I may be imagining the last bit, though.  It&apos;s difficult to do blind<br/>trials with the TX81Z when I know really that I have to press the button 5<br/>times to get to the &quot;right&quot; note.</p><p>Then, I tried at different pitches with different timbres.  The 13/8 seems<br/>to be more consonant than the 11/8 when the notes get higher, or the timbres<br/>get richer.  That is, less like a pure tone.  This is still using harmonic<br/>timbres. I didn&apos;t try 18/11 with this experiment.</p><p>So, those are my opinions.  They may change were I to do the same<br/>experiments on a different day.  The effects are subtle.</p><p>          Graham<br/>          <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/</a></p></div>
