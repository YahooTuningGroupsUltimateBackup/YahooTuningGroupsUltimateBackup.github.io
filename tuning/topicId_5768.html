Ive seen plenty of excerpts of Mozart or Schubert<br/>&gt; symphonies with little N6s, and V7s, viio/iis, and such written<br/>&gt; everywhere---this is what I need....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m to write a 10 page paper(with a 20 minute class presentation)<br/>&gt; for theory class, my topic of choice: Mahler&apos;s Adagios..... his<br/>&gt; harmonic movement is just incredible. Well to analyze hundreds<br/>&gt; of bars, which only a few I will discuss, is quite a project.<br/>&gt; Where can I find someone else&apos;s work to use as bibliography and<br/>&gt; such?</p><p>Hmmm... interesting point you make about the dearth of<br/>&apos;Roman-numeral&apos; (which would be called _Stufen_ in German<br/>theory) analysis of Mahler&apos;s harmony.  Mahler himself<br/>said that his music was basically diatonic, which would<br/>indicate the value of this type of analytical approach.</p><p>Part of the reason is that his work cannot always be analyzed<br/>in this manner in such a straightforward way, because of<br/>his pervasive use of chromaticism and mediant-relationships.<br/>&lt;snip...&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve also done a &apos;Roman-numeral&apos; analysis of m. 49-56 of the<br/>last movement of the 9th - it&apos;s only 8 bars (one variation),<br/>but since you&apos;re working on adagios specifically, you way<br/>want it.  (Just quote this posting with the date and time<br/>in your bibliography if you use it).</p><p>Preface on the notation:</p><p>-  The Arabic numerals should be superscript, and indicate<br/>movement in upper voices - in other words, &apos;6 5&apos; means a<br/>major 6th or 13th moving to the perfect 5th;  the notes<br/>represented by the Arabic numerals are tuned according to<br/>the key indicated by the Roman numeral: for instance, &apos;7&apos;<br/>with &apos;V&apos; means a minor-7th, but &apos;7&apos; with &apos;IV&apos; means a<br/>major-7th; plus and minus signs indicate sharpening or<br/>flattening (respectively) according to these rules.</p><p>- Parentheses are used to help clarify the intonation<br/>of certain intervals where confusion may be a result<br/>of chromatic alteration of the root of the chord.  A<br/>chord is considered to be a major, minor, or dominant<br/>type depending on its Roman numeral in the key of Db-major.<br/>Thus, I and IV are normally major, V is normally a<br/>dominant-7th, and II, III, and VI are normally minor.</p><p>- Commas separate simultaneous events - these numerals should<br/>really be written one over the other: so &apos;6,5&apos; means the first inversion;<br/> the successions of Arabic numerals from left to<br/>right indicate the moving voices from top to bottom.</p><p>- A slash after the Roman numeral indicates inversion of a chord</p><p>- Ellipsis [...] indicates a tie (as from 3rd beat to 4th beat<br/>of m. 49. in the lead voice, which at this point is second<br/>from the top.)</p><p>Key: Db major</p><p>m.<br/>49:<br/>I  3 4<br/>V  6 5,  9 8 +7 8<br/>bVI  +4 +3...<br/>III  7,  ...+5 5,  +3</p><p>50:<br/>IV  5..., +4 3 +2 3<br/>V  7 6 5,  ...4 3 2 3,  7<br/>IV/6,4  6 5 4,  4 3 2<br/>I  8 7 6</p><p>51:<br/>V  -3<br/>II/6  7 6 +5 6<br/>#I  9 8 7 6,  8 9 8 7 8</p><p>52:<br/>VI  6 5<br/>III/6  +5 6,  4 3 +2 3<br/>bIII  +3<br/>V  6 +5 5 +5</p><p>53:<br/>I  4 3...<br/>V/4,3  4 3,  ...9 8,  7 6 5 6<br/>bVI/4,3  7 6 5 6,  3,  6<br/>bIII  +10 (+)9 8 7,  7,  +3, 1 (+)2  [i.e., V of bVI]</p><p>54:<br/>IV  +5 5 (+)4 5,  8 -9 8 (+)7 8<br/>II/6  +2 +3 +2 2 +2, -9 [+1 bass] OR   bVI/2  +5,  2 3 2 +1 2,  6</p><p>55:<br/>V  13, 7<br/>VI  8 7<br/>II  11, 9 8 7 5<br/>V  7 5 2 3</p><p>56:<br/>I<br/>etc.</p><p>The third beat of m. 54 is most interesting. This chord<br/>utilizes the kind of tritone-substitution common in jazz<br/>from bebop and later: it can be analyzed as an inverted<br/>dominant-7th with sharp 11th with a root of either A (= Bbb)<br/>or Eb.  The progression to the Ab dominant-7th is thus<br/>either by semitone (from A) or by dominant relationship<br/>(from Eb); in either case, a strong step in the cadential<br/>formula according to jazz theory.  The rest of the cadence<br/>couldn&apos;t be more conventional, from either a jazz or romantic<br/>standpoint:  an evaded cadence from V to VI, then a<br/>series of dominants VI - II - V - I, without any chromatically<br/>altered chord-tones, that is, respecting the harmonies<br/>resulting from a strict observance of the key-signature.</p><p>After sliding into the key of Bbb-minor momentarily in m. 53,<br/>as in every statement of the theme or one of its variations,<br/>the following Gb chord can be explained as both a submediant<br/>to Bbb and a subdominant to Db, which sounds to me like a<br/>tendency to move back into the tonic Db. But the chord after<br/>that (the one with the tritone double-meaning) has a tritone<br/>interval within it, thus totally confusing the listener&apos;s<br/>expectations as to where the harmony is going.  Analyzed<br/>as an Eb -9 +11, it is a sort of altered II in Db, but<br/>the notes in the &apos;turnaround&apos; melodic figure imply an<br/>interpretation with a root of Bbb much more strongly than Eb.</p><p>Interestingly, this Bbb chord can thus be interpreted as a<br/>dominant-7th-type chord on A, which is V in the key of D,<br/>the key of the opening movement of the symphony.  Mahler<br/>is generally supposed in this movement to be expressing<br/>resignation in the sliding-down of the tonic of the symphony<br/>from D in the first movement to Db in the last.  Perhaps<br/>the hint of A-minor (i.e., Bbb-minor) in m. 53, and of<br/>a dominant of D in m. 54, is a sort of struggle to regain<br/>D-major as a tonic, which is unsuccessful as the harmony<br/>goes firmly back into Db-major at m. 55.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing of all about this chord<br/>is that it lacks the important note Db, which would be<br/>simultaneously both the major 3rd of Bbb and the 7th of Eb<br/>(chord tones which are *necessary* for either of the harmonic<br/>interpretations I&apos;ve given), as well as the general tonic<br/>of the entire passage and movement.</p><p>But immediately at the first beat of m. 55, this listener<br/>feels right back home in Db again.  This amazing artistry<br/>is the result of Mahler&apos;s voice-leading, where the intervals<br/>of the different melodic lines clash vertically but make<br/>total sense horizontally.</p><p>This foreshadowing of jazz harmonic usage in Mahler is<br/>something that can also be seen in Schoenberg&apos;s theories<br/>as presented in his _Harmonielehre_ of 1911.  To a great<br/>extent, it depends on acceptance of the 12-tone equal-<br/>tempered scale as the basic intonational resource, which<br/>I find unusual for Mahler, as his self-stated grounding in<br/>diatonic harmony would imply a form of meantone tuning<br/>in his conception of harmony.  This is one of the reasons<br/>why I find his 9th Symphony to be a kind of new territory<br/>for him.</p><p>BTW, m. 55 is almost a quotation of m. 337 of the first<br/>movement of the 7th.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
