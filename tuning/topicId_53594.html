I found this<br/>group researching some information on microtones. I was curious to see<br/>what this group talks about. I can see, much more than I can<br/>comprehend when it comes to math and physics. I still have my  books<br/>from college. A few on physics and the acoustics of music and this<br/>computer. Although I am not accomplished musician in sight reading, I<br/>do understand some basics in non western tunings, eventhough I hardly<br/>have any use for these scales for the moment. while I am lurking and<br/>searching the previous messages on file, please help me out with some<br/>suggestions for learning this language of non western tunings. Now, I<br/>know why it was important to do well in math, science and physics. I<br/>did have some fun with this virtual playing of the Kithara and hearing<br/>some of the examples of instruments built by Harry Partch. I have my<br/>Harvard Music Dictionary and a book on Twentieth Century music but no<br/>measurement machines of any sort, except a chromatic tuner. I might<br/>want to build me an instrument one of these days. I am surrounded by<br/>lots of trees,plenty of wood in these foothills of the Appalachian<br/>Mts. Last, I am private music teacher needing some higher learning input.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2004 11:34:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Good evening,  Thanks for allowing me to join this group.</p><p>Welcome aboard!</p><p>&gt;please help me out with some<br/>&gt;suggestions for learning this language of non western tunings.</p><p>We don&apos;t have a FAQ, but Joe Monzo has created an excellent<br/>encyclopedia...</p><p><a href="http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc">http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc</a></p><p>..that covers much of the jargon used here.</p><p>If you want graduate level (and beyond) math, Gene Ward Smith<br/>will keep you busy...</p><p><a href="http://www.xenharmony.org/">http://www.xenharmony.org/</a></p><p>...Gene&apos;s also got lots of music downloads.</p><p>Jon Szanto runs a great site on Harry Partch....</p><p><a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p><p>I maintain a list of recommended CDs...</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/">http://lumma.org/</a></p><p>And Andrew Heathwaite lists microtonal music available for<br/>download on the web...</p><p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/music2/aah/microtonal/list.html">http://www.angelfire.com/music2/aah/microtonal/list.html</a></p><p>And you can always ask questions here!</p><p>&gt;I did have some fun with this virtual playing of the Kithara and<br/>&gt;hearing some of the examples of instruments built by Harry Partch.<br/>&gt;I have my Harvard Music Dictionary and a book on Twentieth Century<br/>&gt;music</p><p>It sounds like you&apos;re off to a good start.</p><p>&gt;I am surrounded by lots of trees,plenty of wood in these foothills<br/>&gt;of the Appalachian Mts.</p><p>That&apos;s a good place to be.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>David A.
