Since hearing Paul&apos;s JI<br/>jerry0 and jerry00 as an having an illusionary (presumably) high third, I no<br/>longer do. If you have been following the conversation, you know that the<br/>new question (in my thinking, at least) is: can we identify a *real* high<br/>third that will tune to the illusionary &quot;high third&quot; that seems to result<br/>(for some of us) from a well-tuned JI triad?</p><p>I think the high third is a learned thing that singers and string players<br/>are more likely to perceive (conceive) than other musicians.
