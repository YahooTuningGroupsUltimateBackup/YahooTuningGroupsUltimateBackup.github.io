Not in the melody, at least. In the first example, the 17edo &gt; version appears to be the most correct one to me. The wide fifths &gt; version works a little bit, too, but in all the others the &gt; corresponding interval is clearly minor and thus not really Bayati.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I regularly listen to Turkish and Arabic maqam music. Have amassed quite a collection over the past few years.<br/>And I can tell you by ear that the 17tet version is not much corresponding to how Bayati is usually tuned.<br/>17tet is exaggerating too much and to me it becomes out of tune in a not very pleasant way. The neutral thirds (between 2nd and 4th step and 7th and 9th step in Bayati, both are played in this melody) in 17tet is ~350 cents. This does not correspond to practice.<br/>Perhaps you have become used to it by playing in 17tet a lot?</p><p>The 703.91 cents fifths version is close to actual practice and sounds about the same.</p><p>In my opinion the Pythagorean version expresses the same thing, but with the monophonic melody it is easy to interpret it as a minor second as well, as you say you hear it (and this is quite possible, especially after hearing an exaggerated augmented prime first).</p><p>In the fully harmonized versions there is not much room in hearing it as a minor second though and I&apos;m quite sure you must be hearing it as an augmented prime as well in Pythagorean.<br/>To harmonize it as a minor second would make the melody express a very different thing.<br/>You can try this for yourself. Play the melody in 12tet with the chords Bbmin, Cmin, Dbmaj, Ebmaj, Fmin for the minor second version vs Bbmaj, Cmaj, C#min, Ebmaj, Fmaj for the augmented second version.<br/>You will notice that even in 12tet where the tuning is exactly the same, that the melody expresses something truly different with the augmented prime version (in other words, it&apos;s not just put in a different perspective due to the different chords, it&apos;s truly a different note the C# vs the Db. My other demo on enharmonic difference also demonstrates this, and this is also a normal concept in classical music theory and exploited by countless famous composers including Bach, Mozart and Beethoven etc.)</p><p>Now if you listen to the fully harmonized versions, you will notice that both the 703.91 fifths version and Pythagorean express the same thing. The only difference is that with 703.91 fifths the tuning is a bit different and the chords are out of tune a bit.<br/>17tet does pretty badly as the chords are now pretty badly out of tune but it still expresses the same thing.<br/>And 1/4 comma meantone does so poorly that I don&apos;t know what to make of it, the chords indicate an augmented prime but the tuning is clearly a minor second of Db instead of C# (and a low one at that). I even get the same feeling as a comma shift at times from it.</p><p>Btw, here is the song I took the melody from: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Srkkc0iGU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Srkkc0iGU</a><br/>And here it is again as made popular by the Chemical Brothers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu3FTEmN-eg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu3FTEmN-eg</a><br/>I hope you can hear that my version does not ruin its expression. It is still the same melody. The original is tuned roughly the same as the 703.91 version it seems to me.</p><p>&gt; And again, I do not understand your harmonization choices. On the &gt; first note of Rast you put a minor, and on the first note of Bayati &gt; you put a major triad - the opposite of what I would expect.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Rast does not have a major third above the first degree but a diminished fourth instead. The minor third is therefore the most closely related third for the first degree in the circle of fifths.</p><p>While Bayati does have a minor third above its first degree i chose to use the major third for harmonizing the first degree as it is then a common tone for harmonizing the second degree which is an augmented second above the first degree so the second degree makes a minor third with that same note. It helps make the augmented second clear and prevents it from having a minor second as an alternative interpretation.</p><p>Furthermore I kept the harmonization very simple and clear, parallel fifths with triads following the melody.<br/>Of course the possibilities are near endless with my technique and one can apply western counterpoint rules, different voicings, sixths sevenths ninths chords, etc.</p><p>&gt; BTW, how about making it sound more &quot;human&quot;?

Have amassed quite a<br/>collection over the past few</p><p>&gt;years. And I can tell you by ear that the 17tet version is not much<br/>corresponding to how Bayati is usually</p><p>&gt; tuned. 17tet is exaggerating too much and to me it becomes out of tune in a<br/>not very pleasant way. The</p><p>&gt; neutral thirds (between 2nd and 4th step and 7th and 9th step in Bayati, both<br/>are played in this melody) in</p><p>&gt; 17tet is ~350 cents. This does not correspond to practice. Perhaps you have<br/>become used to it by playing</p><p>&gt; in 17tet a lot?<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; The 703.91 cents fifths version is close to actual practice and sounds about<br/>the same.</p><p>Compared to actual practice in real arabic and turkish music, 17tet is indeed<br/>only a rough approximation, this is true. I am aware of that. I have listened to<br/>your examples and the original again and possibly agree that second note of your<br/>wide fifth version is better. About the other examples, I keep stating that the<br/>econd note is too low.</p><p>&gt; In the fully harmonized versions there is not much room in hearing it as a<br/>minor second though and I&apos;m</p><p>&gt; quite sure you must be hearing it as an augmented prime as well in<br/>Pythagorean. To harmonize it as a</p><p>&gt; minor second would make the melody express a very different thing. You can try<br/>this for yourself. Play the</p><p>&gt; melody in 12tet with the chords Bbmin, Cmin, Dbmaj, Ebmaj, Fmin for the minor<br/>second version vs Bbmaj,</p><p>&gt; Cmaj, C#min, Ebmaj, Fmaj for the augmented second version. You will notice<br/>that even in 12tet where the</p><p>&gt; tuning is exactly the same, that the melody expresses something truly<br/>different with the augmented prime</p><p>&gt; version (in other words, it&apos;s not just put in a different perspective due to<br/>the different chords, it&apos;s truly a</p><p>&gt; different note the C# vs the Db.

Sure, a minor second and an<br/>augmented prime are conceptionally quite different things. So you see the second<br/>note of Bayati as an augmented prime and harmonize accordingly, right?</p><p>Point is, however, my knowledge is that these characteristical neutral seconds<br/>of maqam music, of arabic maqam music in any case, do not really suit into a<br/>strictly pythagorean framework - the note in question, I would say, is neither a<br/>minor second nor an augmented prime. (Margo or Ozan, can one of you or someone<br/>else confirm or disprove?) That may be what distirbed me around your<br/>harmonizations since they all appear to be based on pythagorean thinking. I<br/>would say that an approach based on the mohajira (instead of meantone) or the<br/>maqamic temperament might work better.</p><p>&gt; It is only a simple demo, didn&apos;t try to make it sound pretty :)<br/>&gt; I was planning on making many demos but I think I&apos;m going to focus now on<br/>producing quality music based</p><p>&gt; on harmonized maqams which is general public friendly.

On the first note of<br/>Rast you put a minor, and on the first note of Bayati you put a major triad -<br/>the opposite of what I would expect.</p><p>Rast does not have a major third above the first degree but a diminished fourth<br/>instead.

It seems to be working well.<br/>I still can&apos;t get the roots to change by neutral intervals though, something sounds wrong about that and I don&apos;t see the logic in how that could work and not indicate an augmented prime / diminished third instead.</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Marcel de Velde</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2013 12:50:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Hans and Marcel,</p><p>While I addressed the general question of tuning Maqam Bayyati<br/>and related Near Eastern modalities in a new thread, I just<br/>want to add a bit here about the strategy of tuning -- or,<br/>often, temperament -- to obtain or approximate some Bayyati<br/>tunings of a kind documented or recommended in the literature.</p><p>Certainly an extended chain of Pythagorean fifths is one<br/>good strategy -- if we are ready to support a large tuning<br/>set. In Pythagorean, it takes 19 fifths to generate a<br/>near-13/12 step at 137.1 cents -- an excellent approximation,<br/>of course!</p><p>Temperament in the wide direction is a way of reducing that<br/>chain from 19 fifths to 7 fifths -- or, alternatively, of<br/>using two chains of fifths with an &quot;artificial diesis&quot; so<br/>that wherever in the lower chain of fifths we have a limma<br/>(often around 22/21 or 81 cents in these temperaments), adding<br/>this &quot;artificial diesis&quot; or spacing between the chains will<br/>produce a just or near-just 13/12. The same system can use<br/>both strategies to get two different sizes of small neutral<br/>seconds, permitting two different flavors of Bayyati -- or<br/>more, if we also consider forms where the larger neutral<br/>second step precedes the smaller (as in 11:12:13).</p><p>The first strategy, of tuning 7 fifths up as a small neutral<br/>second, can be used anywhere in the range from 29-EDO to<br/>17-EDO, with the latter as an upper limit. At 29-EDO, or<br/>703.447 cents, 7 fifths up -- the apotome, chromatic semitone,<br/>or augmented prime -- is around 124 cents, about the minimum<br/>for a neutral second. Hormoz Farhat places the range for small<br/>neutral seconds in Persian music at around 125-145 cents.<br/>At around 704 cents, we get a just or near-just 14:13 (128<br/>cents); and around 705 cents, a just or near-just 13:12 (139<br/>cents).</p><p>The second strategy makes most sense from around 29-EDO up<br/>to a bit beyond 704 cents, with the spacing between the<br/>two chains of fifths (which could each be at an MOS of<br/>12, 17, 29, etc.) often at around 91/88, or 58 cents.<br/>Typically we have a diatonic semitone or limma at around<br/>81 cents, say, and a spacing at around 58 cents -- which<br/>means a 13:12 approximation around 139 cents, near-just.</p><p>Systems using the second strategy also use the first,<br/>yielding four sizes of neutral intervals, and lots of<br/>ways to tune Bayyati and related modalities.</p><p>Systems using the first strategy only, with a single<br/>chain of fifths (around 705 cents, say), yield two<br/>sizes of neutral intervals -- for example, at 705 cents,<br/>a step of 135 cents from 7 fifths up (the augmented prime<br/>or apotome), and 150 cents from 10 fifths down (the<br/>diminished third or double limma, equal to twice the limma<br/>at 75 cents). There&apos;s thus a choice between 135-150-210<br/>cents, a great Bayyati of the variety with the smaller step<br/>first often preferred in the Arab world; and 150-135-210<br/>cents, the kind of pattern that results when Bayyati is<br/>tuned as a rotation of Rast. Thus in this 705-cent tuning<br/>(a subset or possibly full set of 80-EDO, as it happens),<br/>a usual Rast would be 210-150-135 cents, with the neutral<br/>third at 360 cents or a near-just 16/13 (359.5 cents);<br/>and 150-135-210 cents results as a simple rotation of<br/>this.</p><p>So tempering the fifth slightly wide is precisely a way<br/>of getting neutral intervals with shorter chains of fifths<br/>than in Pythagorean.</p><p>One thing I should add is that the first tempering strategy<br/>of using the apotome or augmented prime as a small neutral<br/>second can be useful even with a 12-note set, while the<br/>second strategy calls for two MOS sets of 12 or larger.</p><p>Also, first strategy, while it&apos;s fine for smaller sets of<br/>12 or 17, can also be very useful with larger sets like 24,<br/>29, or beyond. For example, at 705 cents, C#-Eb is a large<br/>neutral second, the diminished third or double limma<br/>(C#-D plus D-Eb) at 150 cents. However, we also have a<br/>step C#-Cx at 135 cents. Thus it&apos;s possible to play Bayyati<br/>as either C#-Cx-E-F# (135-150-210 cents) in the manner often<br/>regarded as most stylish; or as C#-Eb-E-F# (150-135-210<br/>cents), as is also preferred in some varieties of practice.<br/>Note that a usual Rast would be B-C#-Eb-E (210-150-135 cents).</p><p>In fact, as an alternative to 17-EDO, a 17-note set at<br/>705 cents might be very attractive.</p><p>! 705-17.scl<br/>!<br/>17-note MOS, fifth 705 cents, near-just 13/8<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 75.00000<br/> 135.00000<br/> 210.00000<br/> 285.00000<br/> 345.00000<br/> 420.00000<br/> 495.00000<br/> 570.00000<br/> 630.00000<br/> 705.00000<br/> 780.00000<br/> 840.00000<br/> 915.00000<br/> 990.00000<br/> 1050.00000<br/> 1125.00000<br/> 2/1</p><p>Note that for the kind of Bayyati tuning that Scott<br/>Marcus describes, with a small neutral second but large<br/>neutral sixth when that step is used in place of the<br/>more common minor sixth, starting on Scala step 13,<br/>or 915 cents -- the note A, if the tuning is read<br/>as C-C -- gives the right intervals.</p><p>0 135 285 495 705 (780) 855 990 1200</p><p>Of course, if circulation is important, then either<br/>17-EDO or a 17-note well-temperament such as George<br/>Secor&apos;s 17-WT makes sense.
