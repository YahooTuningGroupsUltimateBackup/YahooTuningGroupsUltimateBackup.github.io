Glad you like it so much.</p><p>It&apos;s been so long since I wrote the tune,<br/>I really don&apos;t remember what guided me in<br/>choosing the JI pitches and common-tones<br/>I chose.  I&apos;ll try to reconstruct if I can.</p><p>First of all, it&apos;s very perceptive that you<br/>call it a transcription - I don&apos;t recall saying<br/>that anywhere on the webpage.  But it&apos;s true,<br/>I wrote the tune on a little battery-operated<br/>Casio keyboard, in 12-Eq of course, then calculated<br/>on paper how I wanted it tuned.</p><p>This was before I had formulated my lattice theories,<br/>so I was just multiplying fractions Partch style.<br/>Having 19 in there made me do a little work.</p><p>To start with, I had what were clearly &quot;minor 9th&quot;<br/>chords in measures 1, 2, 3, and 5.  I pretty much<br/>trivially decided to make these 5-limit chords, of<br/>the &quot;minor 7th&quot; type we&apos;ve been discussing here recently,<br/>with the 9th added:  10:12:15:18:45.</p><p>I knew that for measures 4 and 6 I wanted to use<br/>otonal &quot;dominant type&quot; chords, and that I wanted<br/>11-, 13-, and 19-identities in those chords.</p><p>I mention on the webpage that there is a &quot;break&quot;<br/>between measures 2 and 3, where a descending passage<br/>occurs too fast for a tuning to be recognized.  I took<br/>advantage of this because I assumed before I started<br/>that in JI, with &quot;interesting&quot; chords and lots of<br/>unusual microtonal intervals, I&apos;d probably end up<br/>modulating a comma or two off by the end of the phrase,<br/>and it repeats, so I had to work around that.</p><p>So I started at the end, the 8/5-Otonality, and worked<br/>backwards from there.  It was mostly just trial and<br/>error.  I remember writing out at least 4 different<br/>tunings, probably up to 8 for some chords.  I just<br/>tried using all the different common-tones I could,<br/>and played around with the numbers until everything fit.</p><p>I say there was a break between measures 2 and 3,<br/>meaning that there was no common tone as it is a<br/>descending parallel chord passage.  So I left the<br/>quick passing chord in 12-Eq, and everything worked<br/>out.</p><p>I didn&apos;t actually hear it until a few years after I<br/>wrote it, when I got my TG-77.  I&apos;ve always liked<br/>the JI version much more than the 12-Eq.  The 12-Eq<br/>sounds totally bland by comparison.</p><p>Also, when the Grand Piano patch plays, the high-limit<br/>ratios blend in such a complex interesting way . . .<br/>I suppose that&apos;s the &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; you mentioned.</p><p>This tune was sequenced in Cakewalk 2.0, the tedious<br/>way - by putting the proper amount of pitch-bend on<br/>every note.  I should remove all the pitch-bend and<br/>put the 12-Eq version on the webpage too, for comparison.<br/>Hmmm, maybe versions in several different tunings...</p><p>I&apos;d definitely like to help you do your 22-Eq song.<br/>Send it over.  I&apos;m trying to get my copy of Rocky<br/>working too.</p><p>-monz<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
