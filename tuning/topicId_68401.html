What&apos;s so<br/>difficult about that concept? And sorry, some harmony is conceived in<br/>a very homophonic planar fashion--some Debussy, jazz, etc--although<br/>voice leading was the dominant paradigm for most of Western Music<br/>history. Homophony as a concept exists, it&apos;s used whether you like it<br/>or not and *not* everything harmonic ought be viewed as counterpoint.<br/>It depends on the style, piece, composer, etc. There are many<br/>composers who weren&apos;t/aren&apos;t big on contrary or oblique motion.</p><p>French music in the 20th century liberated this. Bach is great, but<br/>not the sum total of all musical experiences.</p><p>&gt; Monophonic melody can be completely free.<br/>&gt; Harmony is only a special case of counterpoint,<br/>&gt; being 3 or more voices sounding simultaneously.</p><p>Speaking of Bach, have you ever listened to a Bach solo violin or<br/>cello piece? Are you saying that you don&apos;t hear harmony in single<br/>lines? Read Heinrich Schenker to understand this. The concept of<br/>&apos;unfolding&apos; of harmony for instance. The idea that the ear doesn&apos;t<br/>connect melodic skip and form harmonic gestalts is actually the<br/>ridiculous idea!</p><p>Another thing, how is it that harmony cannot be &apos;free&apos; as you say, if<br/>you combine, contrapuntally, several voices?</p><p>&gt; Then there is the attribute of dimensionality.<br/>&gt; A melody can only be fully represented/graphed<br/>&gt; in 2 dimensions, whareas a harmony only requires<br/>&gt; 1 dimension (points on a line).</p><p>I don&apos;t quite get what you are trying to say? So the representation of<br/>a phenomena says the deepest truth about the phenomena? What do you<br/>mean by points on a line? If harmony is counterpoint as you say, each<br/>strand requires two dimensions.</p><p>Anyway, all this aside, your descriptions of what you are talking<br/>about are less than clear to me, and I get the sense that they are<br/>obfuscated simple tautolgies, or a personal language for I don&apos;t know<br/>what. Some clarification would sure help....</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2006 9:49:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think the question is whether a listener who never ever has heard<br/>C-E-G harmonically would recognize that as harmonic function when<br/>hearing them played melodically...</p><p>There is no getting around the biases we develop as we become familiar<br/>with musical styles and traditions.</p><p>I would argue, however, that true harmony is certainly a different<br/>experience than melody.
