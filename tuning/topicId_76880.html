You could also use two 11-limit commas, three 13-limit commas, etc. The resulting temperament would have three generators -- typically one would be an octave and another can be set to a different consonant interval like 3/2 or 4/3. My original version of starling temperament had the octave, major and minor thirds as generators.</p><p>Two rank 3 temperaments that have had some discussion are marvel and starling. The easiest way to describe a tuning for temperaments like these is to specify a tuning for each of the prime intervals (2/1 3/1 5/1 7/1 11/1). Starling tempers out 126/125, and has a TOP tuning for the prime intervals as follows:</p><p>&lt;1199.010636, 1900.386896, 2788.610946, 3366.048410]</p><p>Marvel tempers out 225/224 and 385/384, with a TOP tuning of the primes like this:</p><p>&lt;1200.508704, 1901.148724, 2785.132538, 3370.019002, 4149.558115]</p><p>Somewhere I have a document with data for other rank 3 temperaments, which have names like Baldur, Odin, and Portent. It&apos;s been so long since these came up on tuning-math that I don&apos;t even know where to start searching.</p></div><h3><a id=76905 href="#76905">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2008 7:12:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi there,<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps someone here could suggest a webpage discussing rank 3 temperaments?<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been trying to find something like that for days.

Thanks a lot in advance.</p><p>Sorry, there&apos;s no single resource.  I was planning to write an article this year but the schedule&apos;s completely fallen by the wayside.  Certainly you can call them rank 3 temperaments and the only contentious term is &quot;temperament&quot;.   I&apos;d like to talk about &quot;planar temperaments&quot; but that term&apos;s in the dog house along with &quot;linear temperaments&quot;.</p><p>I did discuss them with Gene on tuning-math.  You can search the archives.  The theory has advanced since then so it should be possible to search for them much faster.  But I haven&apos;t even implemented those ideas let alone written them up fully.  The basic algorithms are in</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf">http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf</a></p><p>The rank 3 searches I have implemented should still be good enough to find the interesting temperament classes.  You&apos;ll have to work out the Python code though</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/temper/regular.zip">http://x31eq.com/temper/regular.zip</a></p><p>The main reason there hasn&apos;t been much progress is that the world in general hasn&apos;t shown much interest.  Keyboards are naturally 2-dimensional beasts.  You may use a rank 3 system for notation or as a harmonic lattice but there&apos;s no particular need to compare it to other rank 3 systems.</p><p>Still, some systems that have come up (and Gene probably gave names):</p><p>- Tempering out 225:224 from 7-limit JI.  This is the union of a lot of common temperament classes.  It could be applied using a kcyboard or system of notation designed for 5-limit JI.  It&apos;s essentially what my tripod notation (also not written up) is based around.</p><p>- Tempering out 2401:2400 from 7-limit JI.  Gets you very close to JI.  The 7-limit neutral thirds lattices I use for miracle temperament generalize to this rank 3 class.  The searches Gene and I have done confirm that it&apos;s an optimal rank3 temperament FWIW.  You can also extended into the 11-limit by associating 11:9 with the neutral thirds.  It&apos;s far less accurate but still a stand-out system.</p><p>- Using miracle temperament with an additional accidental to show the difference between 21:16 and 13:10, for example. This came up as an optimal 13-limit system on some search I did.</p><p>- There are other interesting notations you can get by starting with schismatic (which is a simple chain of fifths) and adding an accidental for the 7- and 11-limits.</p><p>                Graham</p></div>
