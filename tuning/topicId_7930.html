The melody is usually sung in<br/>&gt;something roughly close to 12-tone Pythagorean (3-limit), while the notes<br/>&gt;used for the chords fit almost exactly in the 7-limit.</p><p>[Paul Erlich]<br/>&gt;The 7-limit harmony in barbershop is not merely &quot;stuck on&quot; to the diatonic<br/>&gt;scale; it consists of dominant seventh chords which are diatonic in<br/>&gt;function and origin, and the 27-cent adjustments required to achieve JI are<br/>&gt;not large enough to disturb the essential diatonicity of the music.</p><p>...Barbershop uses the 4:5:6:7 as a functional harmony far more often than<br/>as a dominant chord...</p><p>[Paul Erlich]<br/>&gt;As for the pitch sets being different for melody and harmony, don&apos;t tell me<br/>&gt;that the sevenths of these dominant seventh chords never occur in the<br/>&gt;melody!</p><p>[me]<br/>&gt;They do, but not often.  If the lead is singing the 7, then usually the<br/>&gt;tenor has the melody.  There are many songs where the melody contains no<br/>&gt;pitches outside the 3-limit.  What is important is that the melody is not<br/>&gt;really part of the voice leading in the traditional sense, except in the<br/>&gt;case of sustained notes.  Chords are built _on_ it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
