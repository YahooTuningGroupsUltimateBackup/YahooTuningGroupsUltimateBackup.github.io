My original intent was just to see if my<br/>&gt; long wait time was &quot;normal&quot; or not and after the responses I lost a little<br/>&gt; control over my frustration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paolo<br/>&gt;</p><p>I hate to disagree with some of our experts on the list, Keith Grady and<br/>Paul Erlich. It&apos;s especially dangerous to disagree with Paul Erlich.<br/>Usually one gets one&apos;s head chopped off...</p><p>Perhaps it is better to start with the Genesis and Helmholtz than with<br/>Doty&apos;s primer-- which is tilted in a certain direction, for certain.<br/>[But don&apos;t tell me that Partch and Helmholtz aren&apos;t &quot;slanted.&quot; Come<br/>on!..]</p><p>However, for me, personally, the Doty primer was a wonderful find, and<br/>seemed to &quot;pull it all together.&quot;  I have studied it carefully several<br/>times, and am doing so again for review.</p><p>As you can see from his recent post [TD 604] on the Tuning List, Doty<br/>has &quot;connected the dots&quot; and responded to this list, so I would urge<br/>Paolo to just e-mail the justmeister.</p><p>You&apos;ll PROBABLY get the book then.  Oh... and when you do get it, please<br/>remember that gray hair will be fine.  There&apos;s no problem with it.  Just<br/>let it grow out that way....</p><p>________ _____ ____ __ _ _</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
