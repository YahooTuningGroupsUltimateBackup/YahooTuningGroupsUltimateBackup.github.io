Carl, Mike, would you pass it on?</p><p>First, I note wryly that I seem to have confused Paul - this is some sort of an achievement; perhaps not one to be proud of.  I was trying to say that I needed to look at the shape of a &quot;Tenney set&quot; in triad space in order to be certain that I included enough &quot;seed points&quot; in the calculation.</p><p>The last file I sent contains good results (I believe) for all triads a:b:c with a*b*c &lt;=256 (free parameter s=1.225%, seed points limit N=1M).  I did look at a plot of 3HE vs a*b*c but I couldn&apos;t see a significant trend.  Perhaps 256 is too small.</p><p>Paul then (re-)asked for a*b*c &lt;=10000.  This calculation is running now, starting with the triads 1:1:x, but it is taking a loooong time (note that there are 10000 of these alone, and the seed point set contains 20M points even with the &quot;cutoffs&quot; I am applying).  I have uploaded a graph of the results *so far*, see:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/SteveMartin/3HE11x.png">/tuning/files/SteveMartin/3HE11x.png</a></p><p>Steve.</p></div><h3><a id=100821 href="#100821">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2011 5:22:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Steve,</p><p>I haven&apos;t gotten any e-mails recently.

But I won&apos;t flip a coin, I&apos;ll choose the one<br/>&gt; that matches the coordinate system, for three main reasons:<br/>&gt; 1) it, ahem, matches the coordinate system; seems to me therefore<br/>&gt; it is best placed to generalize for use in 4HE :o)<br/>&gt; 2) I have re-read Paul&apos;s &quot;subtlety&quot; text and don&apos;t quite agree<br/>&gt; with it; I think that moving one note in a triad by x cents can<br/>&gt; be said to move the triad by more than x cents.<br/>&gt; 3) my code already uses it, and my recent results are correctly<br/>&gt; labelled as such (but on the down side, they use too large an &quot;s&quot;)</p><p>Great choice!  Can you provide a brief write-up on the order<br/>of Paul&apos;s subtly text?  If so, I&apos;ll add it to the page.<br/>You could start with what you posted the other day.  Also it&apos;d<br/>be good to get s scaled to match (at least going forward...<br/>maybe Paul will even re-do the existing graphics).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=100879 href="#100879">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2011 7:11:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I eliminated the wavering by only including points like 1:1:2^n<br/>&gt; in one data series, and in separate series, 1:1:3*2^n, etc.<br/>&gt; These rational triads are expected to have smaller 3HE values,<br/>&gt; so I also included separate series for triads shifted by<br/>&gt; 30 cents in triad space, to illustrate higher 3HE values (the<br/>&gt; shorthand 1:1+e:2^n-e is intended to indicate this).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In summary, up to about 7000cents, we see the behaviour we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; seen before - a steady range of values depending on how &quot;just&quot;<br/>&gt; the triad is.  But the new graph confirms the result of my<br/>&gt; previous one - that above 7000cents the values start to<br/>&gt; increase with the size of the outer interval (and there seems<br/>&gt; no longer to be a clear difference between more and less<br/>&gt; &quot;just&quot; triads).</p><p>These &quot;more just&quot; traids are only more just in the prime-limit<br/>sense... one of the coords is still a big odd number, right?</p><p>&gt; Note that these results are only for the upper interval growing<br/>&gt; large, with the lower remaining small.  I will do a set with<br/>&gt; the lower growing large, and the upper remaining small next.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m out of time to write more now - I think the results are<br/>&gt; explained by the shape of the &quot;Tenney&quot; set in triad space -<br/>&gt; comparatively &quot;nice&quot; near its centre (the unison point), but<br/>&gt; not so nice at its edges.</p><p>I think this makes sense.  6 octaves is really wide.
