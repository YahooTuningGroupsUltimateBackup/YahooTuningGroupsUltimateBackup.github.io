The &quot;pain&quot; occurs<br/>&gt;&gt; because lowering the submediant creates an ambiguous and perhaps misleading<br/>&gt;&gt; tritone with the supertonic (when it is also sounding). Your &quot;powerful<br/>&gt;&gt; drive&quot; in this case does not resolve inward into a third. A ii6 chord nearly<br/>&gt;&gt; always goes to a V chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think you&apos;d be surprised as to how often it goes to the I chord.</p><p>Of course, I wouldn&apos;t.

Why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; also, the borrowing often takes place in the context of a dominant<br/>&gt; chord -- the ninth of the dominant chord is very often flatted, even<br/>&gt; in a major key, to take advantage of the powerful drive the 2-b6<br/>&gt; tritone has to resolve inward into a third.</p><p>I have no problem with this statement.
