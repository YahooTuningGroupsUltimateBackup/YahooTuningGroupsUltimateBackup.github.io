It<br/>&gt; shows the 1.3.5.7.9.11 Euler-Fokker genus (which Wilson calls<br/>&gt; the &quot;Grand Slam&quot;) in four different lattice orientations. The Figures<br/>&gt; 37 and 36 should be familiar from our previous discussions -- the<br/>&gt; symmetrical figure at the center of each is of course the Eikosany,<br/>&gt; using the centered pentagon lattice, with different lines made<br/>&gt; visible in each case. The Stellated Eikosany would be as symmetrical<br/>&gt; as the Eikosany itself, while the E.F. genus, as you can see, is<br/>&gt; elongated in one direction. Figure 35 is how Fokker would probably<br/>&gt; lattice the thing -- using four directions for the four primes 3, 5,<br/>&gt; 7, and 11. The factor of 9 accounts for the basic hypercube structure<br/>&gt; being repeated two extra times along the 3 axis.

Other than a single<br/>&gt;&gt;point, a structure can&apos;t be maximally symmetrical in both lattices.</p><p>&gt;Yes- could you explain how that fits into the discussion?</p><p>Just showimg that the _fully_ stellated CPS has to be distinct from the E.F.<br/>genus.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I think the idea is that you always reach a point where you are up<br/>&gt;&gt;against other copies of the CPS you started with in all directions,<br/>&gt;&gt;so with stellation you&apos;ve essentially included all the resources you<br/>&gt;&gt;could possibly use to move from one CPS to another.</p><p>&gt;The plain E.F. genus should do that</p><p>No, it only exploits a few of these resources.</p><p>&gt;But my second question is a<br/>&gt;little more arcane; is there any structure, containing incomplete<br/>&gt;chords, such that every time you complete all the chords you create<br/>&gt;new structure with some incomplete chords?
