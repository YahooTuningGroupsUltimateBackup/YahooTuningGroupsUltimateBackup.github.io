Balzano, in his 1980<br/>&gt; paper in Computer Music Journal, showed that the smallest proper set of<br/>&gt; 12tET to contain all twelve intervals is the diatonic scale.  In fact, I<br/>&gt; think this is true of any series-of-fifths-gerenated scale tuned in the<br/>&gt; next highest ET in the series 3, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31.</p><p>Actually, the smallest subset of 12TET containing all 12 (or 6,<br/>disregarding inversions) intervals IS the C-Db-E-F#, or C-Db-Eb-G set and<br/>their inversions.</p><p>I think what Balzano was pointing out was a even wieirder property of the<br/>diatonic scale.   If you look at the intervals between: each note of the<br/>scale, and all of the other notes in the scale;   then, you will see that<br/>each kind of interval appears a unique number of times.</p><p>thus in the diatonic scale you find there are 2 semitones, 5 whole-tones,<br/>4 minor thirds, 3 major thirds, 6 perfect fourths, and one tri-tone.<br/>So, a Unique amount of each interval[-class (i.e.--not counting<br/>inversional equivalents (5th =4th)].</p><p>This helps  &quot;efficiency&quot; I guess, as if you get one semitone  (say, B-C)<br/>and then part of the other semitone  (F#) then you know what transposition<br/>of diatonicity you&apos;re in (BCDEF#GA).</p><p>Actually this &quot;unique-amount-of-each-interval&quot; property is shared by a<br/>6-note chromatic &quot;wad&quot;, but, that&apos;s not as exciting  (at least according<br/>to most of the world.)</p><p>bye bye</p><p>Christopher Bailey</p></div>
