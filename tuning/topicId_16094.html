This interval played such an important role because of the<br/>combined characteristics of harmonically being high up in the overtone<br/>series (15:16), and as the basic step in the 12 tone scale.</p><p>The harmonically (lattice) equivalent in the BP scale would be 27:35, but<br/>this is 3 steps. The 1 step is 25:27, the equivalent of the major second<br/>8:9. So to do a &apos;Webernian&apos; counterpoint I wanted to make a 13 tone row with<br/>two equivalent inflection points for both these intervals. And then there is<br/>of course the radically different symmetricity properties of a 13 tone row<br/>compared with a 12 tone row.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>When the term serialism pops  up in these discussions, I always realize that<br/>my view on what serialism is, differs considerably with the general<br/>concensus. This can be traced back to my former teacher, Gottfried Michael<br/>Koenig. Before he came to the Netherlands he was active in that hell hole of<br/>serialism, the Cologne Electronic Studio (collaborating with Stockhausen).<br/>By the time I met him, he had taken serialism much further, in a general<br/>constructive sense. Serialism for me became much more investigating all the<br/>consequences of taking musical parameters as mathematical entities in<br/>general, not just organizing and manipulating them in rows. Also the duality<br/>of determinism-stochasticity was a central issue. In these regards<br/>everything I do, in music or graphics, is always serial.</p><p>By the way, my regard for Koenig is something I share with Ligeti who I can<br/>quote: &apos;I could not have written Atmospheres, however, without my<br/>experiences in the Studio for Electronic Music in Cologne or without the<br/>friendship of Gottfried Michael Koenig. From him I learned not just studio<br/>technique, but also what was for me a totally new &quot;constructive&quot; musical way<br/>of thinking.&apos;</p><p>I remeber that Koenig used 60 EDO in some of his works, but strictly for the<br/>combinatorial property of having a maximum number of divisors.</p><p>Kees<br/><a href="http://www.kees.cc">www.kees.cc</a></p><p>PS<br/>Monz, I love your Vienna page.
