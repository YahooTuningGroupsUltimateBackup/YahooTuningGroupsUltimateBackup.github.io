Is there an accepted<br/>&gt; convention on this?

Ellis<br/>and Rameau give names to intervals that have pretty much<br/>been adopted by theorists as the standard ones, at least for<br/>&apos;common-practice&apos; harmony.</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 477.10]<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll try to give you a sense of why meantone (and thus<br/>&gt; Vicentino&apos;s JI scheme) works for anything in the Western<br/>&gt; repertoire without enharmonic respellings, and what happens<br/>&gt; when you do have enharmonic respellings. Basically, there are<br/>&gt; only two independent commas that come into play when trying<br/>&gt; to analyze or render music of the Western conservatory<br/>&gt; tradition in just intonation. Let&apos;s take the syntonic comma<br/>&gt; and the Pythagorean comma as the two basic ones (any two would<br/>&gt; do). The syntonic comma is four fifths minus a third, so we can<br/>&gt; write it as s=4v-t. The Pythagorean comma is twelve fifths;<br/>&gt; write it as p=12v. Other important commas:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. schisma = -8v-t = s-p<br/>&gt; 2. diaschisma = -4v-2t = 2*s-p<br/>&gt; 3. (minor or Great) diesis = -3t = 3*s-p<br/>&gt; 4. major diesis = 4v-4t = 4*s-p<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you think there might be others, check out Mathieu&apos;s<br/>&gt; _Harmonic Experience_, which is a thorough survey of Western<br/>&gt; harmony through JI glasses. Mathieu does not mention the<br/>&gt; &quot;major diesis&quot; but he does name one other, the &quot;superdiesis&quot;,<br/>&gt; which is 8v-2t = 2*s. But basically, we&apos;ve got it all covered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Structurally, the syntonic comma results in no notational<br/>&gt; change, while the Pythagorean comma changes a flat to the<br/>&gt; enharmonic sharp (e.g., Ab-&gt;G#). (You may want to verify this<br/>&gt; for yourself). From the equations above, we can see that commas<br/>&gt; 1-4 above all result in a notational change opposite that of<br/>&gt; the Pythagorean comma, i.e. they change a sharp to the<br/>&gt; enharmonic flat.</p><p>From a &apos;practical&apos; point of view, Paul is probably right that<br/>these &apos;commas&apos; (the smallest and largerst of which are actually<br/>forms of skhisma and diesis, respectively) are the only ones<br/>that need be considered.</p><p>But strictly speaking, depending on how far one takes the<br/>powers of 3 and 5 in any given 2-dimensional lattice or<br/>periodicity-block, there are all sorts of &apos;commas&apos; that may<br/>come into play.</p><p>Paul is using &apos;comma&apos; here in a very generic sense to mean<br/>a small interval, which in many cases will be used as a<br/>unison vector to delimit the boundaries of a periodicity-block.<br/>Wilkinson 1988 uses the term &apos;anomaly&apos; as a generic word<br/>designating several different of these: skhismas, commas,<br/>and dieses, and I use it too.</p><p>I&apos;ve made a lattice diagram giving the cents-values of all<br/>the 5-limit intervals between 0 and 100 cents, within the<br/>arbitrary exponent-limits of +/-15 for prime-base 3 and<br/>+/-7 for prime-base 5.  Hopefully some of you will find this<br/>useful.</p><p>In addition to the &apos;anomalies&apos;, this lattice also indicates<br/>the smaller of the 5-limit &apos;semitones&apos;.  It can be seen easily<br/>from the lattice that all the intervals are made up of various<br/>combinations of the ones described by Paul, and indeed, all<br/>of them can be described in terms of combinations of the<br/>syntonic and Pythagorean commas, or the syntonic comma and<br/>skhisma.  The lattice also makes it easy to see the periodicity<br/>inherent in the system, as the patterns of relationship between<br/>several small intervals repeats at several places in the lattice.</p><p>(Use Courier New font, or another fixed-width font.  If it<br/>doesn&apos;t form a perfect grid in your browser, then that&apos;s<br/>because my or your email software added unintended line-feeds.<br/>Simply copy and paste the lattice to a text file and remove<br/>the superfluous line-feeds to correct the view.  Use a font-size<br/>that is small enough to make it a perfect grid, or turn off word<br/>wrap.)</p><p>Lattice of cents-values of 5-limit intervals from 0 to 100 cents<br/>with arbitrary boundaries of
