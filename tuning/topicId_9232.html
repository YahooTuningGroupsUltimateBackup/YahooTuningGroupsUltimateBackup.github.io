You can&apos;t imagine how helpful that<br/>was in his &quot;point of it all&quot; message toward an understanding of the other<br/>related posts...  This is just to encourage the cognocenti to throw these<br/>&quot;sops&quot; from time to time in the middle of a discussion.  If I&apos;m reading<br/>correctly and some people are lurking around here for a YEAR without making<br/>a single post,  I&apos;m sure there are others who could benefit from similar<br/>&quot;illuminations...&quot;  Thanks again!<br/>______________   ________  _____  ___  __  _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
