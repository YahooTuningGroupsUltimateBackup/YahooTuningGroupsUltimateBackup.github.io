Direct electric connection is better, unless<br/>&gt;&gt;you&apos;ve got a lot of money to spend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OK. So other than the cost, what is the disadvantage of using midi?  I can<br/>&gt;think of several advantages --particularily the ability to compose with a<br/>&gt;software sequencer where compositions could played on a timer, or a<br/>&gt;compositon could provide a background for live improvisation with the<br/>&gt;carillon or other instruments.</p><p>None other than cost.  Just be aware that if you want midi to control the<br/>sound, you&apos;ll need to pay all kinds of attention to stuff like latency to<br/>get it as responsive as a direct analog connection.  Although it sounds<br/>like you won&apos;t be using velocity or aftertouch, and with only two octaves<br/>there should be enough note numbers to go around...</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I was planning to use old computer keyboard switches.  Any thoughts on<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;this type of switch?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Don&apos;t use it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What type of switch would you use?  I have tactile switches that have a<br/>&gt;very short throw, but they feel kind of stiff and unresponsive.  This may<br/>&gt;not be the case once they get wide keycaps.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what types are available.  There&apos;s a lot of variety in the<br/>feel of computer keyboards... although I realize this may not be due<br/>entirely to the type of switch.  At least check a Jamco catalog, before<br/>re-using keys from discarded keyboards as Denny was planning to do.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
