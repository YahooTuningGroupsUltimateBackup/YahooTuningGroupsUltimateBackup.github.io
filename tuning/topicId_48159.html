Why? Because publishers are ignorant, and stupidly don&apos;t trust information that comes from outside the publishing business. When you approach a publisher with a book proposal, their standard procedure is to check around with other publishers to see whether other books on the same subject are making any money. If no one else has a book out there, that means - in the deaf-and-dumb idiot logic of the publishing world - that there must be no desire for such a book. NO ONE, no one, no one wants to take the risk of having the first book out on any subject - which means, if it were left to the publishers, there would never be any new knowledge in the world. I&apos;ve sat on panels and publicly excoriated publishers for this stupid policy, only to have them sit and nod like those little plastic dogs in car rear windows. But someone will eventually break the tuning book barrier, just like Rob Schwartz broke the minimalism book barrier a few years ago - for years there couldn&apos;t be any books about minimalism (&quot;It&apos;s not important music&quot; &quot;It won&apos;t last&quot; &quot;No one&apos;s interested in reading about that&quot;) and then Rob Schwartz persevered anyway, and now there are plenty of books about minimalism. It will happen with tuning, too, and suddenly books on tuning will be hot (exactly the way Hollywood will make a movie about time travel or cross-dressing, and suddenly we&apos;ll be deluged with movies about time travel or cross-dressing).  Then people will be *begging* music writers for tuning books, so they can compete with other publishing houses. Right now publishers will swear as though it&apos;s the plainest common sense in the world that tuning is an esoteric subject with no audience and no future - and they should be contradicted at every opportunity, with confidence and with contempt for the ignorant dinosaurs they are, because the first book that makes it out there will change their tune. And when that time comes, Monz&apos;s book will get published in hardcover and will become the important reference work on the subject. I know this will happen. It&apos;s just so frustrating waiting for someone to get that first book out there. I&apos;m halfway done with such a book myself, but not in a hurry, because if someone else gets there first I&apos;ll have an easier time with mine. And Monz, if you ever want a reference to give a publisher, or someone to call on as a reader to recommend the book, feel free to use my name.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=48201 href="#48201">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2003 9:28:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kyle,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;snip&gt; ...

(was: tuning books to<br/>buy)</p><p>  &gt; FYI, you ought to consider putting your dictionary of<br/>  &gt; tuning terms in hard copy and publish that as well. I&apos;d buy it!<br/>  &gt; (never underestimate people&apos;s desire for hard-copy in this<br/>  &gt; internet age)</p><p>  &gt;oh, i don&apos;t. thanks for the tip anyway.<br/>  &gt;i already plan to eventually publish the Dictionary --<br/>  &gt;which will morph into the Encyclopedia of Tuning -- as well<br/>  &gt;as my collected posts to the tuning lists.<br/>  &gt;both will probably have to be multi-volume. i&apos;ll also<br/>  &gt;collect all of my other webpages on tuning into a volume.<br/>  &gt;the Encyclopedia of Tuning will also come bundled with<br/>  &gt;the software.</p><p>  It&apos;s extremely difficult to interest publishers in a book on tuning - I&apos;ve<br/>been trying for years. Why? Because publishers are ignorant, and stupidly<br/>don&apos;t trust information that comes from outside the publishing business.<br/>When you approach a publisher with a book proposal, their standard procedure<br/>is to check around with other publishers to see whether other books on the<br/>same subject are making any money. If no one else has a book out there, that<br/>means - in the deaf-and-dumb idiot logic of the publishing world - that<br/>there must be no desire for such a book. NO ONE, no one, no one wants to<br/>take the risk of having the first book out on any subject - which means, if<br/>it were left to the publishers, there would never be any new knowledge in<br/>the world. I&apos;ve sat on panels and publicly excoriated publishers for this<br/>stupid policy, only to have them sit and nod like those little plastic dogs<br/>in car rear windows. But someone will eventually break the tuning book<br/>barrier, just like Rob Schwartz broke the minimalism book barrier a few<br/>years ago - for years there couldn&apos;t be any books about minimalism (&quot;It&apos;s<br/>not important music&quot; &quot;It won&apos;t last&quot; &quot;No one&apos;s interested in reading about<br/>that&quot;) and then Rob Schwartz persevered anyway, and now there are plenty of<br/>books about minimalism. It will happen with tuning, too, and suddenly books<br/>on tuning will be hot (exactly the way Hollywood will make a movie about<br/>time travel or cross-dressing, and suddenly we&apos;ll be deluged with movies<br/>about time travel or cross-dressing).  Then people will be *begging* music<br/>writers for tuning books, so they can compete with other publishing houses.<br/>Right now publishers will swear as though it&apos;s the plainest common sense in<br/>the world that tuning is an esoteric subject with no audience and no<br/>future - and they should be contradicted at every opportunity, with<br/>confidence and with contempt for the ignorant dinosaurs they are, because<br/>the first book that makes it out there will change their tune. And when that<br/>time comes, Monz&apos;s book will get published in hardcover and will become the<br/>important reference work on the subject. I know this will happen. It&apos;s just<br/>so frustrating waiting for someone to get that first book out there. I&apos;m<br/>halfway done with such a book myself, but not in a hurry, because if someone<br/>else gets there first I&apos;ll have an easier time with mine. And Monz, if you<br/>ever want a reference to give a publisher, or someone to call on as a reader<br/>to recommend the book, feel free to use my name.</p><p>  Cheers,</p><p>  Kyle</p><p>        Yahoo!

I keep a copy of Brian mcLaren&apos;s &quot;A Brief<br/>history of Microtonality&quot; on reserve in our library (Eastern Illinois<br/>University). My own writing consciously draws from established<br/>Western traditions (which will always be treasured in academia)<br/>to introduce new approaches to notation and new instruments<br/>with the aim of revitalizing music education - music theory,<br/>composition, ear training, and performance practices. If<br/>education does not change, I feel there is little hope for success.</p><p>Aaron Hunt</p></div><h3><a id=48226 href="#48226">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2003 8:10:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; if microtonalists ever take over the academy (with the power of<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers and Nature itself behind them), they&apos;ll make the<br/>&gt; 12-tone wars<br/>&gt; &gt; of the 1970s look like a picnic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Kyle</p><p>There is a great sematic problem here in that &quot; microtonality&quot; included varied diverse approaches to the subject of tuning. many unreconcilable to each other. 20 years ago free inprov people were opposed to microtones , now they play the same thing and call it microtonality.
