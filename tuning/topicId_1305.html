It will much raunchier on a clarinet than on a<br/>violin.</p><p>Huh? I would have thought the opposite, since the main source of<br/>beating/roughness of the 400-cent M3 is due to the 4th partial of the<br/>higher note clashing with the 5th partial of the lower note. On a<br/>clarinet, the 4th partial is often very weak, so the clashing would be<br/>milder or alleviated altogether. So what&apos;s really going on?</p></div>
