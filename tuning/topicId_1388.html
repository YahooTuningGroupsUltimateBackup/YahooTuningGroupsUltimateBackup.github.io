I&apos;m not sure if I agree that<br/>either is clearly more important a distinction than the other, but if there<br/>is indeed a precedent for strings-or-not being a more basic distinction,<br/>then I&apos;ll play along.</p><p>   Until this though, I would have classified piano, along with guitar,<br/>clavichord, harpsichord, mandolin, lute, etc., as both percussion and<br/>stringed instruments.  If it produces sound by applying a burst of energy<br/>to vibrating medium, and then lets it die away, I would have called it<br/>percussion.</p><p>   That then raises an interesting question:  Is there a word for such an<br/>instrument?  Perhaps &quot;percussive&quot; instead of &quot;percussion&quot;?</p></div><h3><a id=1426 href="#1426">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;caccola@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/1999 11:10:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;d rather classify the instruments by the direct, primary means of playing<br/>the instrument: bowing, plucking, keying, striking (Russolo&apos;s classes can be<br/>applicable).</p><p>    Clavichords, harpsicords and pianos share the initial actuating lever of a<br/>keystick, and while the posture and playing style are similar enough to<br/>constitute a class, ultimately they do not share mechanics. The tangential key<br/>of the clavichord does not work in the same sense as a mallet, nor does the<br/>hinged tongue of a harpsichord work like escapement does in a piano action.</p><p>    The Turkish music piano of the early 19th century sometimes featured a<br/>pedal mallet that struck the less-strung, more membranous soundboard directly,<br/>but this is more akin to bowing cymbals.</p><p>    In my opinion, the distinctness of the piano (fretted clavichord,<br/>harpsichord, harp, chittarone/theorbo and baryton) lies less in the strings<br/>than in their number.</p><p>Clark</p></div>
