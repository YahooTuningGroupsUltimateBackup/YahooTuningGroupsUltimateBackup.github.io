Presumably<br/>maximising the number of &lt;3,5,7&gt; lattice triads wasn&apos;t one of them particularly,<br/>or if that was the objective, and the scale was just poorly constructed, maybe it<br/>will still turn out to have interesting emergent properties.</p><p>It&apos;s not surprising that it would look poor on that criterion, and that scales constructed<br/>to maximise the number of lattice triads will look better.</p><p>But it needn&apos;t be ones only objective, to maximise the number of lattice triads in a<br/>scale.</p><p>Otherwise all j.i. music would have to be written in harmonic fragment scales, such as<br/>1/1 5/4 11/8 3/2 7/4  (say) as they maximise the number of lattice triads (because every<br/>three note subset is a lattice triad). That particular one is a five note scale with<br/>5*4*3/3*2*1 = 10 otonal triads - the maximum possible in a five note scale.</p><p>It&apos;s lattice diagram would be a pentad, or a 5-simplex as a mathematician would call it.</p><p>Just to suggest some ideas (for scales in general):</p><p>One might be interested in some particular type of chord.</p><p>One might be interested in near consonances rather than exact ones.</p><p>One might want to use particular patterns of scale steps in melodic movement.</p><p>One might also be interested in working in a scale with few consonant triads, in order to<br/>help<br/>focus ones ideas.</p><p>One might want a scale that gives nice approximations to inharmonic timbres such as<br/>bell sounds, or to gamelan scales.</p><p>I&apos;m sure one could come up with many more ideas here.</p><p>I don&apos;t think one could ever come to a final conclusion about whether a scale is good to<br/>use or not, as there are so many variables to take into consideration.</p><p>I think best is to think of a j.i. composer as having the entire space of<br/>rational ratios and n-tet subdivisions, plus irrationals like golden ratio etc.<br/>as an infinite scale to work in, and any other scale as a convenient subset<br/>to aid composition or to help players of the pieces.</p><p>Re the text descriptions of scales</p><p>&gt; If this could happen, and people would do it, it would be terrific...</p><p>Yes, I think so too!</p><p>&gt; Er... agreed.  Some simple, fast method for making colorful lattices,<br/>&gt; like a &quot;visual construction set&quot; would be a great asset.  Let&apos;s say<br/>&gt; with lines that one could just easily link together... like a Viseo<br/>&gt; program or something... and perhaps an automatic place for the ratio.</p><p>&gt; Well, this is just dreaming, but sometimes things can come of it...</p><p>Yes, sounds a nice idea!</p><p>I&apos;ll keep it in mind - may turn out to be something I could do in either the<br/>VRML Trees program or FTS.</p><p>Meanwhile though, it&apos;s possible that something like this could have been<br/>developed already, and we just don&apos;t know about it yet - lattices are<br/>pretty generally used, and the idea of labelling one of the vertices is a<br/>natural one to have.</p><p>If it was in VRML, then adding MIDI clips would be easy too.</p><p>If not, I suppose a good musical lattice construction kit would be<br/>found useful in other areas too, like chemistry.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
