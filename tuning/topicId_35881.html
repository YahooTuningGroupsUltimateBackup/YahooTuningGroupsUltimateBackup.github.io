I looked up<br/>&gt; accordions once, and they have a very different pattern where three notes<br/>&gt; in a row are a 5-limit chord.  The usual meantone layout for a GK would be<br/>&gt; halfsteps in both directions for 12-equal instead of whole and half steps<br/>&gt; in different directions.  That means whole tones where you have minor<br/>&gt; thirds.</p><p>So, judging from the links you sent, there are oodles of<br/>variations. The one I described is that of a contemporary<br/>Russian bayan. The more elaborate models have up to 5 rows<br/>of diminished triads; having the largest steps along the<br/>edge of the instrument means you don&apos;t have to move so much<br/>with only three rows of buttons (on a three-row instrument,<br/>you have an octave of the chromatic scale under four<br/>fingertips).</p><p>If I remember correctly, the left hand side (on an<br/>instrument that cost a veritable fortune) could switch<br/>between the same layout as on the right for polyphonic music<br/>and probably a more accordeonly, fifth based arrangement for<br/>the oom-pah stuff.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you have a diagram anywhere?</p><p>Only memories of the explanations I got when I was playing<br/>alongside a &quot;portable acoustic keyboard&quot; (for an open air<br/>theatre production) who just happened to come from Russia<br/>and to play the bayan.</p><p>But for the fact that tuning a free reeds affects the<br/>substance of the instruments, instruments of more than three<br/>rows would seem very suitable at least for the common<br/>practice enharmonics. Still not a mass market. But perhaps<br/>it wre better for Starr Labs (for example) to garner the<br/>accordeon market instead of guitarists?</p><p>Welcome the hell, here&apos;s your chromolodeon?</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=39470 href="#39470">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2002 11:03:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Compromise has little place in art. What if Beethoven decided that going from a 20 min to a forty min sym was just too long, what would have been gin by shortening it 10 min.<br/> Such way of thinking stands in the very way of what art is and does. We are to look and be informed by the future. Anything less is an academic exercise. when you have something to say you say it, we are not diplomats<br/>     Percussionist although they tend to specialize go from instrument to instrument and if our keyboard players can go from piano, to samplers, to organ and harpsichord another type of keyboard is minor or would be in a little time. Nothing is more difficult that placing these scales on a conventional 12 note dinosaur and attempt to freely dive head long into a tuning. We need to be able to interact with our visual feedback to grab these mandalic entities by the horns and ride them across the stadium.<br/>27 years of microtonal music for myself and i have no time to wait for others to catch up, or I and others need our keyboards now.<br/>People like George Secor, or Michael Zarkey will act and built them as i do with some mallet instruments and we can not be concerned with whether it is accordance to one of history&apos;s least inspired moments.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU 88.9 fm Wed. 8-9pm PST.<br/>live stream <a href="http://kxlu.com">kxlu.com</a></p></div>
