[By the way, from WHERE are you writing... are you in<br/>Germany??]</p><p> I have to say that some of my ideas concerning Nancarrow&apos;s &quot;intent&quot;  (here<br/>we go again!) comes from the Continuum program notes of a few years back...<br/> Maybe he had in mind to use the player piano before he went to Mexico [are<br/>you SURE about that??!], in any case, the isolation would certainly<br/>contribute to his enthusiasm for this direction...  I think that&apos;s<br/>inarguable...</p><p>By the way, by NO MEANS did I mean to suggest that Nancarrow was &quot;looking<br/>for fame!&quot;  NOT AT ALL.  Anybody could tell he was absolutely not that kind<br/>of composer...  I simply meant that frequently, for better or worse,<br/>composers become recognized because of some &quot;gimmick&quot; or novelty that they<br/>stumble upon along the way.  Often, it&apos;s not even the best work, but the<br/>recognition comes from the novelty...  This does not mean that it is<br/>intentionally &quot;sought after.&quot;</p><p>Another good example is my former friend, composer Otto Luening (1900-1986)<br/>, whose name rarely appears on this list.  This is too bad, since Otto was<br/>VERY involved in acoustic experiments, electronic music and just intonation<br/>experiments.  He used the overtone series as his PRIMARY means of<br/>generating all harmony, even in his 12t-ET works.  In this sence Otto<br/>Luening was BASICALLY a microtonalist...  Maybe most of you know that he<br/>also wrote the first preface to Harry Partch&apos;s &quot;Genesis of a Music.&quot;  The<br/>&quot;fame&quot; thing worked the same way with him, however.  Although he didn&apos;t<br/>seek it, his moderate &quot;fame&quot;  -- well, he even made it to the &quot;Today Show&quot;<br/>-- came from his work in ELECTRONIC music, even though it was a small<br/>percentage of his total output.</p><p>I personally feel this is a lucky occurrence, as in the case of Nancarrow.<br/>Because of some &quot;novelty&quot; the composer&apos;s name and other music receives<br/>exposure.  Yes, I agree, there are some composers who bang on cans (whoops,<br/>I&apos;m in trouble now!) to attract attention and &quot;fame&quot; but Nancarrow and<br/>Luening were certainly not in this tribe...</p><p>Thanks for the update on the Gann book.  He mentioned he was doing one a<br/>couple of years ago.  However, I have never seen a copy in any bookstore.<br/>It must be that people are buying it up fast (??)  In any case, does anyone<br/>have the book and the publisher&apos;s name and address.  I would like a copy...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/1999 2:15:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks for the update on the Gann book.
