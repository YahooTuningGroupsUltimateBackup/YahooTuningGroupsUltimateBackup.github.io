While I wish I did know and have practice with quickly finding EDOs according to desired intervals using Vals and Monzos...often I find the above method fairly adequate...and much much easier to quickly understand than the &quot;Monzo fractions of a Val prime mapping&quot; lingo behind regular temperaments.</p></div>
