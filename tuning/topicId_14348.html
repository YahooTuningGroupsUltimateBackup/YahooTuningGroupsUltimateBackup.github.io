On paper, I don&apos;t like the 8-note version, but I do like the<br/>&gt;10-note one, and the 7-note one is somewhere in between.  Now to play<br/>&gt;with &apos;em...</p><p>You misunderstood my purpose in giving the number of triads in 8 notes. I&apos;m<br/>sorry I did not make it clear. I&apos;ll spell it out in gruesome detail below<br/>so that others may benefit as well.</p><p>The quote above only shows one line of a longer table, but of course there<br/>were other generators. I merely wanted an easily understood way of<br/>comparing the triads-per-note for the given generators. There was no<br/>intention to suggest that chains of 8 notes was in any way a &quot;scale&quot; for<br/>any of them. I chose 8 notes because that was the minimum number that gave<br/>more than zero triads for the worst generators listed.</p><p>This was exactly the same reason I gave &quot;number of tetrads in 10 notes&quot;<br/>when listing 7-limit generators some months back. Not because I thought 10<br/>notes was a particularly good scale for any of them (although it did happen<br/>to be so for some).</p><p>The notes are the fence-posts while the generators are the gaps in between.<br/>There is always one more post than there are gaps. So 8 notes means a chain<br/>of 7 generators.</p><p>In general, when considering a single chain of some generator, the complete<br/>x-limit chord [having (x+1)/2 notes] has a certain pattern on the chain.<br/>The pattern has a certain width, given by the maximum of the number of<br/>generators in a dyad over all dyads. As you can read from the table, this<br/>is 5 in the above chain-of-major-thirds example (a chain of 5 generators is<br/>needed to make a 2:3). Of course octave-equivalence is assumed in this<br/>discussion.</p><p>The complete utonality always has the same width on the chain as the<br/>otonality. It is simply the otonal pattern rotated 180 degrees. So there<br/>will always be as many otonal as utonal (i.e. as many major as minor in the<br/>5-limit case).</p><p>If our scale consists of a chain which is only as wide as our chord (e.g. 6<br/>notes in our case) then we will have only 2 chords (one major one minor).<br/>For every note we add, we get to slide the chord patterns one more position<br/>along the chain, and so we get 2 more chords for every note we add.</p><p>Or we lose two chords for every note we remove (assuming we remove it from<br/>an end of the chain, so we still have a single chain)*.</p><p>This goes for any odd-limit and for any generator in a single chain. Given<br/>the width &quot;w&quot; of the chord, in generators. A chain of n notes will give you<br/>max(0, 2*(n-w)) chords.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t apply for N chains spaced 1/N of an octave apart (where N is<br/>typically 2, 3 or 4).</p><p>The actual choice of the number of notes for a scale should be based also<br/>on melodic criteria and playability criteria as Carl has done. Myhills<br/>property (or MOS) (only two sizes of scale step) seems to be an almost<br/>essential requirement for good behaviour in these regards.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>* Removing a note from the interior of the chain _nearly_ always breaks<br/>more chords than removing one from an end. A notable exception is this<br/>(well known?) interrupted chain of meantone-fifths at the 7-limit.</p><p>Db Ab .  .  F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# .  .  D# A#<br/>1  3        5                 7                  otonal pattern<br/>7                 5        3  1                  utonal pattern</p><p>This has 6 tetrads whereas a single chain of 12 notes would only have 4. If<br/>you look at the holes left when the otonal and utonal chord patterns<br/>overlap on this chain you&apos;ll see why this one works. It is proper too, but<br/>really has too many notes to be a &quot;scale&quot;.</p><p>In general it can be very useful to draw these chain diagrams for different<br/>generators, with the chord patterns, so one can _see_ how they work.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=14390 href="#14390">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2000 5:40:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This doesn&apos;t apply for N chains spaced 1/N of an octave apart<br/>(where N is<br/>&gt; typically 2, 3 or 4).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The actual choice of the number of notes for a scale should be<br/>based also<br/>&gt; on melodic criteria and playability criteria as Carl has done.<br/>Myhills<br/>&gt; property (or MOS) (only two sizes of scale step) seems to be an<br/>almost<br/>&gt; essential requirement for good behaviour in these regards.</p><p>But N chains spaced 1/N of an octave apart will result in an non-<br/>Myhill, non-MOS scale, though it still may have only two step sizes.<br/>There&apos;s an &quot;official&quot; name for scales with two step sizes -- I forget<br/>what it is.</p></div><h3><a id=14392 href="#14392">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2000 6:23:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;But N chains spaced 1/N of an octave apart will result in an non-<br/>&gt;Myhill, non-MOS scale, though it still may have only two step sizes.</p><p>Thanks for clarifying that.</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s an &quot;official&quot; name for scales with two step sizes -- I forget<br/>&gt;what it is.</p><p>Let&apos;s keep forgetting it.
