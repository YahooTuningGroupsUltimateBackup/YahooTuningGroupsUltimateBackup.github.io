Perhaps I&apos;m<br/>wrong. Then again, when you&apos;re dealing with 53 notes to the octave, it<br/>may very well be necessary.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=90094 href="#90094">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2010 6:44:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello John, can you disclose, if you can, the equations Mr. Garibaldi<br/>used for this extra precision?</p><p>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Jun 9, 2010, at 8:58 PM, John H.
