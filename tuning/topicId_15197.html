A small bit about myself, I am a guitarist<br/>who is very much into everything and everything.  A recent<br/>performance by the California Guitar Trio has sparked my interest in<br/>learning scales differently in what they term, New Standard Tuning.<br/>From low to high it is C-G-D-A-E-G.  I was curious to know two<br/>things. I am assuming that because of the lower tuning on the low end<br/>and higher tuning on the high end I should vary the string gauge if<br/>performing such a tuning, and how the tuning is in relation to the<br/>piano keyboard.  Is this an orchestral tuning?</p><p>Just a novice stabbing at beautiful sounds. Thank you all.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I<br/>don&apos;t know what you mean about orchestras, but in any case, it really just a<br/>different way of tuning a standard guitar. The pitches will still be the<br/>same as the corresponding pitches on the piano.</p><p>This list is about tunings that _don&apos;t_ correspond with a way of tuning a<br/>standard guitar so that the pitches are the same as those on a piano. Most<br/>guitarists on this list have at least one guitar that does not have the<br/>standard arrangement of frets -- they usually have more than the standard<br/>number, say 19 or 22 instead of 12 per octave, or are partial or bent frets<br/>that don&apos;t go straight across the neck.</p><p>There&apos;s bound to be a list somewhere of Frippophiles exploring the New<br/>Standard Tuning. Good luck with it!</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
