Too bad you&apos;ve got that cloaking thingy...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -igs</p><p>Yeah it is a cross-eyed bear... and the cloaking device really protects ya&apos;ll more than it does me, &apos;cause I don&apos;t know $#!+ about tuning. So I lurks about hiding and watching while you tuning eggucated folks have at.</p><p>Thing is I&apos;ve been lurking for quite some time, since Apr 26, 2K3, actually and confess that most of the posts here are difficult for me to make heads or tails of so I&apos;ve gone for longer and longer periods of time without reading posts that make me feel iggynant. Just now I am taking another stab at this area of knowledge.</p><p>This is a subject I&apos;ve wanted to want to learn about (we all do what we Really want, ay?), and that is shifting to more, I want to learn about &quot;micro&quot; tuning which sounds kule and Just Intonation is simply a wae kule sounding phrase calling up images of fair words in a reassuring voice.</p><p>I mostly Love Percussion and building instruments to support that fix. The past several years I&apos;ve been getting into what I call &quot;tuned percussion&quot; hence my subscription here on [MMM] and the [tuning] channel also at yahoo.</p><p>I am contemplating and planning a marimba soon, the fellow that is going to mentor me through it I met on the drumming lists and he recently moved here. He asked me what range and tuning I wanted. I chose a Bass and because I already have a 12tET soprano marimba and a Senegalese balafon that is I believe pentatonic. He is telling me that diatonic is the way to go to have a Bass marimba that will &quot;play well&quot; with the keyboards I already have. I really don&apos;t grasp this at all, yet.</p><p>I&apos;m thinking if you want me to post more, I need a shoe-horn to get my foot in the door, &apos;cause this is all still Greek or unGrok or something along those don&apos;t have a clue lines for me.</p><p>I accept that I am a dilettante trying to overcome my shallowness in a rather superficial way. Can any of you remarkably astute folks steer me to some (free/online) entry level tutorial so&apos;s maybe I can contribute something other than other folks words, sometime before Armageddon sets in?</p><p>Can you Help?<br/>Thanks for Everything!<br/>One Love, R<br/>++++++<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;To know the road ahead, ask those coming back.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>- Chinese Proverb</p><p>Why do bands have bass players?<br/>To translate for the drummer.</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Music is essentially useless, as life is.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>- George Santayana (1863-1952)</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Life is like music; it must be composed by ear, feeling, and instinct, not by rule.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>- Samuel Butler</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;These go to eleven.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>- Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel in &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; Embassy Pictures, 1984</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;The new humanity will be universal, And it will have the artist&apos;s attitude, that of the musician; That is, it will recognize that the immense value and beauty of the human being lies precisely in the fact that each individual belongs to two realms, simultaneously, that of nature and that of the spirit.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>- Thomas Mann</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;While making music together, people surpass invisible frontiers- as music is the only language which reaches from heart to heart without words or aggression.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>- Yacoub &apos;Bruno&apos; Camara of Fatala</p><p>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Percussion music is revolution. Sound and rhythm have too long been submissive to the restrictions of nineteenth century music. Today we are fighting for their emancipation. Tomorrow, with electronic music in our ears, we will hear freedom. At the present stage of revolution, a healthy lawlessness is warranted. Experiment must necessarily be carried on by hitting anything-tin pans, rice bowls, iron pipes-anything we can lay our hands on. Not only hitting, but rubbing, scraping, making sound in every possible way...What we can&apos;t do ourselves will be done by machines which we will invent.&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>- John Cage, 1939, from Rebirth Of the Cool Phive CD booklet<br/>++++++</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Reverend R Clark &lt;clark@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; &lt;cloaking device deactivated&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Greetings Folks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://home.acceleration.net/clark/PaperVu/quoter/Collected.Works_Giants.html">http://home.acceleration.net/clark/PaperVu/quoter/Collected.Works_Giants.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;cloaking device reactivated&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Does this Help?<br/>&gt;&gt; Thanks for Everything!<br/>&gt;&gt; One Love, R<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=58036 href="#58036">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2005 8:32:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I accept that I am a dilettante trying to overcome my shallowness<br/>in<br/>a<br/>&gt; rather superficial way.
