You won&apos;t believe where I am right<br/>now....</p><p>Right in Times Square...  There is a new place<br/>called &quot;easyEverything&quot; called &quot;The World&apos;s largest Internet Cafe...&quot;</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t bother anybody with this, except for the fact that there<br/>are about 500 to 700 stations here... I kid you not... all with flat<br/>screens attached to banks of straight desks...</p><p>Also, for only $1.00 I have FIVE HOURS of Internet access... and if<br/>one REALLY wishes to be extravagant, for $5.00 one gets that PLUS<br/>Microsoft Office... if you need that in a pinch.</p><p>Really Public Internet.  Here it is.</p><p>This just opened today... not quite the Sears Tower... but getting<br/>there!!</p><p>(The new Madame Tussards is next door... somehow appropriate)<br/>__________ ___ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
