And we, in turn, if we hope to be better understood by<br/>her (and by others with differing viewpoints), should keep diplomacy<br/>in mind in our role as ambassadors for our individual and collective<br/>viewpoints.  (Keep in mind that most of us hope that one day we might<br/>be understood by those in the musical mainstream, so we should<br/>approach this situation with that in mind.)</p><p>I recall that, several months after I showed up on the tuning list, I<br/>expressed a difference of opinion about a couple of things and felt<br/>the heat go up suddenly (this for someone in basic agreement with the<br/>majority view here).  I think that I would have to multiply that<br/>feeling many times over to understand how Julia must feel about some<br/>of the things that we have been saying about her ideas (and now about<br/>her).  I would conclude that all of this can get a bit overwhelming,<br/>and in our eagerness to express our ideas, we sometimes come across<br/>as a bunch of unruly kids who want quick answers or want to prove<br/>that we&apos;re right.</p><p>In confronting ideas or opinions different from my own, I have found<br/>that it often takes some time to think through my responses, and the<br/>interactive nature of this medium tends to make that difficult, if<br/>not impossible.  (I recall that at one point several months ago I<br/>started making comments &quot;shooting from the hip,&quot; which got me into a<br/>little bit of trouble.)  If Julia has come across to anyone as<br/>a &apos;school mistress,&apos; perhaps it&apos;s because that&apos;s an appropriate way<br/>to treat a bunch of kids that are ganging up on you.</p><p>I strongly advise that we follow the example of Paul Erlich, who has<br/>made the effort to offer Julia some constructive criticism, tempered<br/>with respect for her ideas and appreciation for her talent and<br/>abilities.  Such an attitude serves to promote a better understanding<br/>of one another&apos;s values and goals, while maintaining valuable lines<br/>of communication and even encouragement.</p><p>And let&apos;s cut her some slack and give her enough time to sort things<br/>out.

But we need to be more than just that.</p><p>Consider the circumstances of the present situation:</p><p>1) Julia Werntz&apos;s ideas were being challenged before she showed up<br/>here.  Anyone with any real convictions is going to have strongly<br/>held ideas, and all of us have preconceptions about others that are<br/>to some extent inaccurate.  Should she have rid herself of those<br/>before coming here and, if so, how and where?</p><p>2) Should we have rid ourselves of our misconceptions about her<br/>before she showed up here and, if so, how?</p><p>3) She came as a guest.  Hospitality (not hostile engagement) should<br/>have been our first priority.</p><p>4) She came here as one having very different ideas about<br/>microtonality than most of us do -- a stranger in a foreign land.<br/>Preconceptions and misconceptions are inevitable, but they run in<br/>both directions -- it is all too easy to see them in someone else,<br/>yet fail to seem them in ourselves.  Recognition of this fact is<br/>essential to successful diplomacy.</p><p>5) We vigorously challenged her misconceptions about us while<br/>barraging her with our own misconceptions about her.  So what did we<br/>expect to get in return?</p><p>Treat your guests with gentleness and respect, and they will return<br/>the favor.  First establish your common ground; then seek to<br/>understand your differences.  You don&apos;t have to resolve any of them.<br/>(Not all of us here agree about everything, do we?)  But we should at<br/>least seek to establish an open line of communication so that we can<br/>discuss our differing views constructively and arrive at a better<br/>understanding (as well as being better understood).</p><p>We all want to see microtonality as something other than a niche<br/>market, and the more cooperation that can be achieved in seeking that<br/>end, the better the likelihood of that occurring.</p><p>Life has its lessons, and the worst mistake we can make is to fail to<br/>learn the lessons that come as a result of our mistakes.</p><p>--George</p></div>
