The same goes for injera.</p><p> #2. As the Czech &quot;ch&quot; is essentially the same sound as the Spanish &quot;j&quot;, I think I&apos;m pronouncing words like &quot;schisma&quot; actually close to the intended Greek pronunciation. Since &quot;schismatic&quot; is an English adjective and can be directly translated into Czech and so can &quot;meantone&quot;, I usually call them by their &quot;translated&quot; names since I obviously speak Czech most of the time.</p><p> #3. Since Tanaka wrote his papers in German, maybe &quot;kleisma&quot; should be pronounced with a vowel shift like &quot;klaesma&quot; or some such, which is again something I don&apos;t do because a direct phonetic transcription of &quot;the same letter meaning the same sound&quot; would call for pronouncing the &quot;ei&quot; as in &quot;eight&quot;.<br/>However, I can&apos;t remember myself ever having said &quot;kleismic&quot; -- for me it&apos;s either &quot;hanson&quot; if the 7/1 is (-1, 22) or &quot;keemun&quot; (aiming for a tipical English pronunciation) if the 7/1 is (2, 3).</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2011 10:32:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, I can&apos;t remember myself ever having said &quot;kleismic&quot; -- for me it&apos;s<br/>&gt; either &quot;hanson&quot; if the 7/1 is (-1, 22) or &quot;keemun&quot; (aiming for a tipical<br/>&gt; English pronunciation) if the 7/1 is (2, 3).</p><p>Hanson doesn&apos;t map 7 at all; &lt;0 6 5 22| is catakleismic and &lt;0 6 5 -31| is countercata.</p></div>
