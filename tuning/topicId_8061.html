I suggested &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love&quot;, by the Beatles, which starts<br/>out with a major triad on the tonic. My student said that she knew that<br/>song, so we tried it. Guess what? When we sang &quot;Can&apos;t buy&quot; as a 4:5 root to<br/>third, it didn&apos;t sound anything like what Paul McCartney sang. When we sang<br/>something higher than that for &quot;Buy&quot; (maybe 7:9?) it sounded just like what<br/>Paul sang.</p><p>Let me suggest the following experiment for any of you who are completely<br/>familiar with &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love&quot;. BEFORE you go and listen to the Beatles&apos;<br/>recording, use a guitar or a keyboard or something with which to set the<br/>key. Play just the tonic note and then sing &quot;Can&apos;t buy&quot;, sustaining the<br/>&quot;buy&quot; along with the tonic from your guitar or keyboard. As you are about<br/>to do this, think about Paul McCartney singing the tune and do your best to<br/>sing it his way. Ask yourself: Does the &quot;buy&quot; that you are singing sound<br/>like it is 5/4 relative to the tonic? If not, try singing &quot;Can&apos;t buy&quot; with<br/>5/4 relative to the root and ask yourself: &quot;Does that that sound like what<br/>Paul sang?</p><p>Once you&apos;ve done that experiment, then listen to the Beatles.</p><p>Might somebody be able to do a spectral analysis in order to measure the<br/>first three pitches Paul sang? Fortunately he sings them without<br/>accompaniment of any sort, so there is no problem of sorting out multiple<br/>voices.

They both<br/>sounded close to what Paul sings, to me:</p><p>ratio   prime-factor  ~cents<br/> 32/25         5^-2     427<br/>162/125  3^4 * 5^-3     449</p><p>The 162/125 [basically a quarter-tone, right between 2^(4/12)<br/>and 2^(5/12)] sounded like it may be a little too high, but<br/>32/25 sounds just right if not a little flat.  This lends<br/>a lot of weight to John&apos;s interpretation of the Paul&apos;s &apos;3rd&apos;<br/>as 9/7.</p><p>In fact, I think the &apos;5th&apos; that Paul sings may also be<br/>sharp: 243/160 = 3^5 * 5^-1 = ~723 cents, a syntonic comma<br/>higher than 3/2, sounded fine to me coming after either of<br/>the two &apos;high 3rds&apos; tabulated above.</p><p>That&apos;s my 1/600 of an &apos;octave&apos;.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

Experimenting further with my 5-limit lattice<br/>re: John Link&apos;s ideas on _Can&apos;t Buy Me Love_ [TD 506.8],<br/>I found a 5-limit ratio that is very close to his proposed 9/7<br/>(only  ~0.4 cent flatter): 625/486 = 3^-5 * 5^4 = ~435.5 cents.</p><p>This pitch sounded OK as the &apos;high 3rd&apos;, in combination with<br/>the 243/160 &apos;comma-high 5th&apos;, but to me seemed perhaps just<br/>a little sharp.

This amounts to a<br/>low 5th instead of a high 3rd (I&apos;m keeping the 3rd at 5/4).</p><p>Here&apos;s my rationale:  Assume the key of the song is C major, making the<br/>notes in question C, E, G.  Well, at the time these notes are sung, the<br/>song has a &quot;temporary&quot; tonic of A (minor).  So he&apos;s actually singing the<br/>top 3 notes of an Amin7 chord:  A, C, E, G.</p><p>Here&apos;s the ratios and their corresponding Nowitzkian Note Names, including<br/>the unsung A:</p><p>     Ratios     Ratios    Nowitzkian<br/>    if A=1/1   if C=1/1   Note Names<br/>    --------   --------   ----------<br/>      16/9      40/27         4G<br/>       3/2       5/4          4E<br/>       6/5       1/1          5C<br/>       1/1       5/6          4A</p><p>(More info on Nowitzkian Note Names at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://nowitzky.hypermart.net/justint/nnn.htm">http://nowitzky.hypermart.net/justint/nnn.htm</a>&gt;.)</p><p>So as usual, I&apos;m pushing 5-Limit Just Intonation.  Notice that my tuning of<br/>the G is not so foreign when in the context of the A.  It also is<br/>consistent with the subsequent Dmin7 chord (with the lyrics &quot;No no no&quot;).<br/>The 4G and 4A are each a perfect 5th (3/2) away from the 4D in a Dmin7.</p><p>I end with this warning:  I&apos;m combating a cold and a major depression right<br/>now, so my intonation and brain may not be very reliable...</p><p>--Mark</p><p>__________________________________________<br/>NetZero - Defenders of the Free World<br/>Get your FREE Internet Access and Email at<br/><a href="http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html">http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html</a></p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@acceleration.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2000 6:49:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is my analysis using spectrogram.

After reading this, I thought<br/>about it some more and realized that the only way those<br/>large-integer ratios in my Beethoven experiment<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm</a><br/>make any sense is by extended reference, altho it may be a<br/>different kind of extended reference than the type described<br/>by Boomsliter and Creel.  (I&apos;d have to look into it further<br/>to provide more extensive comment.)</p><p>But what I find really interesting, as I mentioned about a<br/>month ago in connection with my retuning of my piece _3 Plus 4_,<br/>is that a certain high-integer ratio which is close in pitch<br/>to a much lower-integer but higher-prime-limit one, sounds<br/>so appropriate when the lower-integer higher-prime one<br/>doesn&apos;t.  (The specific example from _3 Plus 4_ was the low<br/>&apos;minor 3rd&apos; of 64:75 vs 6:7.  See TD 461.10 and 461.17.)</p><p>In the Beethoven experiment, there may be some justification<br/>for calling my method &apos;cavalierly jumping around the lattice<br/>picking up ratios&apos;, but it was based on the idea that<br/>Beethoven probably did not intend or imagine harmonic<br/>relationships with a prime-limit higher than 5.  Altho<br/>I can&apos;t provide any concrete references, this idea stems<br/>from my pretty extensive knowledge of Beethoven&apos;s life<br/>and music.</p><p>But in the Robert Johnson analysis,<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a><br/>I have stated clearly that the ratios I chose are based<br/>primarily on the actual pitches that Johnson sang, and<br/>secondarily on my desire to fit those pitches into a Partchian<br/>Monophonic tuning system.  There was no cavalier &apos;jumping about&apos;<br/>involved there.  I simply tried to keep the ratios to as small<br/>an integer- and prime-limit as possible, and to keep them<br/>as closely-related to 1/1 as possible.</p><p>Of course, in my own piece I was guided more by my own<br/>&apos;inner ear&apos; and various formal/structural desiderata.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
