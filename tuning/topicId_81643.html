But be prepared for critisism :-)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Ok I will post a small part of it :)I&apos;m not afraid of critisism, if I can&apos;t agree with the critisism I have no problem with it, if I can agree with the ciritisism I will learn from it.<br/>Similar to how critisism on my mess of Lasso made me realise something about retuning sounding notes in JI in a score written in 12tet (which I&apos;ll revisit later)<br/>Ok so here&apos;s part of the thing I discovered.</p><p>I think that music is allways about harmony (the tonal part) and can&apos;t escape from harmony unless it&apos;s noise.Not even monophonic melody can escape harmony since every note is judged against its preceding note even though they don&apos;t sound at thesame time.</p><p>Now harmony is infinite in it&apos;s possibilities of construction.But to try to understand harmony I tried to rate harmony from the most simple contruction to more complex contructions.<br/>For this I looked at the harmonic overtone series as it is the most perfect harmonic construction <a href="http://possible.It">possible.It</a> is also rateable from simple to more complex. seen from 1/1 you get 1/1 2/1 simplest, 1/1 2/1 3/1 next simplest, 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 next simplest, etc.<br/>When looking at the harmonic series I can see different parts of it that make it perfect.First the consecutive parts of 2/1 3/2 4/3 etc, and the order from big to small.There are more parts and reasons i can see that make it perfect but i&apos;ll keep this mail small.</p><p>Now if one takes one part that makes the harmonic overtone series construction perfect, namely that it is constructed from ever smaller intervals, then you can construct a different series by reshifting the order.<br/>This retains the ever smaller interval size perfection and simplest to more complex ordering that comes with it. It loses the order <a href="http://perfection.So">perfection.So</a> this new series goes like this: simplest 1/1 2/1, next simplest 1/1 2/1 3/1 and 1/1 3/2 3/1. both having thesame source of 1/1.<br/>first one is 1/1 + 2/1 + 3/2, second one is 1/1 + 3/2 + 2/1.put one on top of the other and you get 1/1 3/2 2/1 3/1next simplest harmonic construction is 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 (1/1 + 2/1 + 3/2 + 4/3) which also becomes 1/1 3/2 2/1 4/1 (1/1 + 3/2 + 4/3 + 2/1), and 1/1 2/1 8/3 4/1 (1/1 + 2/1 + 4/3 + 3/2), and 1/1 4/3 2/1 4/1 (1/1 + 4/3 + 3/2 + 2/1).<br/>These are all the possible orderings when going till the 4th harmonic.All on top of eachother they give 1/1 4/3 3/2 2/1 8/3 3/1 4/1Please note that I&apos;m not bringing everything down into 1 octave.</p><p>If you go untill the 5th harmonic you get this:<br/>1/1 2/1 3/1 &nbsp;4/1 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-2-3-4-51/1 3/2 3/1 &nbsp;4/1 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-3-2-4-51/1 3/2 2/1 &nbsp;4/1 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-3-4-2-5<br/>1/1 3/2 2/1 &nbsp;5/2 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-3-4-5-21/1 2/1 8/3 &nbsp;4/1 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-2-4-3-51/1 2/1 8/3 &nbsp;10/3 5/1 &nbsp;1-2-4-5-31/1 4/3 8/3 &nbsp;4/1 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-4-2-3-51/1 4/3 8/3 &nbsp;10/3 5/1 &nbsp;1-4-2-5-31/1 4/3 5/3 &nbsp;10/3 5/1 &nbsp;1-4-5-2-3<br/>1/1 4/3 2/1 &nbsp;4/1 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-4-3-2-51/1 4/3 2/1 &nbsp;5/2 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-4-3-5-21/1 4/3 5/3 &nbsp;5/2 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-4-5-3-21/1 2/1 3/1 &nbsp;15/4 5/1 &nbsp;1-2-3-5-41/1 2/1 5/2 &nbsp;15/4 5/1 &nbsp;1-2-5-3-41/1 5/4 5/2 &nbsp;15/4 5/1 &nbsp;1-5-2-3-4<br/>1/1 3/2 3/1 &nbsp;15/4 5/1 &nbsp;1-3-2-5-41/1 3/2 15/8 15/4 5/1 &nbsp;1-3-5-2-41/1 3/2 15/8 5/2 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-3-5-4-21/1 5/4 15/8 15/4 5/1 &nbsp;1-5-3-2-41/1 5/4 15/8 5/2 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-5-3-4-21/1 2/1 5/2 &nbsp;10/3 5/1 &nbsp;1-2-5-4-3<br/>1/1 5/4 5/2 &nbsp;10/3 5/1 &nbsp;1-5-2-4-31/1 5/4 5/3 &nbsp;10/3 5/1 &nbsp;1-5-4-2-31/1 5/4 5/3 &nbsp;5/2 &nbsp;5/1 &nbsp;1-5-4-3-2<br/>With all harmonic constructions put on top of eachother you get this:&nbsp;1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 5/2 8/3 3/1 10/3 15/4 4/1 5/1</p><p>Now this is harmonic structure simplicity in the way i described it.<br/>It does not mean that every one of those harmonies is the most simple or consonant harmony, since we abandoned the perfect ordering of the harmonic series.<br/>Of the above only 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 has the perfect ordering. Nonetheless all the above harmonic structures are simplest and most perfect in their interval sizes construction.<br/>Btw the number of different base harmonic structures for the above 5th harmonic limit structure is 1*2*3*4 = 24<br/>If one counts all the number of pitches (non unique) making up those harmonic structures the number is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120</p><p>Now if one takes this structure to the 6th harmonic you get:</p><p>1*2*3*4*5 = 120 different harmonic structures.Comprised of 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720 non unique notes.<br/>I&apos;m not going to paste this list of 120 harmonic constructions here now for the readability of this email, I&apos;ll paste it in the next message.</p><p>When you put all the harmonic structures on top of eachother you get:1/1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 9/4 12/5 5/2 8/3 3/1 16/5 10/3 18/5 15/4 4/1 9/2 24/5 5/1 6/1</p><p>When you look at for instance the octave from 2/1 till 4/1 you see:1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1</p><p>Now these are the most simple harmonic structures based on interval sizes.<br/>But without any ordering, infact with every possible ordering.<br/>To work with these one still has take into account <a href="http://ordering.Now">ordering.Now</a> we make a simple ordering division into this list of harmonic structures.<br/>We devide the list into 2 lists first.<br/>1 list is all the different orderings of interval sizes except the 5/4 then 6/5 order we find in the harmonic <a href="http://series.So">series.So</a> the below list is allways 4:5:6, the rest of the intervals still have all possible orders.<br/>You get:1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1 9/4 5/2 8/3 3/1 10/3 15/4 4/1 9/2 5/1 6/1Seen in 1 octave (or from 2/1) you get:1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1</p><p>Now this is the major scale!</p><p>When you now do the oposite, namely order it with first 6/5 then 5/4 then you get:1/1 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 9/5 2/1 9/4 12/5 8/3 3/1 16/5 18/5 4/1 9/2 24/5 6/1<br/>Seen in 1 octave (or from 2/1) you get:</p><p>1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 9/5 2/1</p><p>This is the minor scale!<br/>And not only did we get the major and minor scale, we got them including every single on of their most simple interval based harmonic structures.<br/>(we did not get more complex harmonic structures which can also underly these scales, the list of which is infinite, though we can list the &quot;next simplest&quot;)<br/>So we can see these scales as coming from the most simple harmonic structures in which you can reverse the ordering of the harmonic overtone series, but not reverse the order of 5/4 + 6/5 in the scale (or while playing).<br/>Simplest reversion would be the octave, next simplest the 3rd harmonic, next simplest 4th harmonic next simplest 5th harmonic, next simplest 6th harmonic.The reversion of the 6th harmonic we don&apos;t seem to like a lot.<br/>Not only seen from the scales above, but play 1/1 5/4 3/2 then 1/1 6/5 3/2. It&apos;s not pretty.The reversion of the 5th harmonic is allready a bit strong, play 1/1 4/3 5/3 then 1/1 5/4 5/3.(please note these are &quot;reversions&quot; or whatever they should be called, not inversions)</p><p>Ok I&apos;m tired of typing for right now, bussy day but I&apos;ll add a lot to this later.Below I&apos;ll paste the diatonic major and minor scales seen from all their different degrees (which can all function as a tonal center, though none as good as the 1/1 of the harmonic structure offcourse)<br/>Also below are diatonic like scales based on thesame harmonic structure of the 6th harmonic but with slightly different ordering rules.Also soon i&apos;ll explain harmonic interval structures of higher harmonics, this is where it gets even more interesting :)</p><p>Base Modes:<br/>mode 1 (major)1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1&nbsp;&nbsp;9/8 : 10/9 &nbsp;32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 40/27 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1&nbsp;5/4 : 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp;2/1<br/>&nbsp;4/3 : 9/8 &nbsp; 5/4 &nbsp; 45/32 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 15/8 2/1&nbsp;3/2 : 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1&nbsp;5/3 : 9/8 &nbsp; 6/5 &nbsp; 27/20 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp;2/1&nbsp;15/8: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 64/45 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1</p><p>mode 2 (minor)1/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 9/5 2/1&nbsp;9/8: 16/15 32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 64/45 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1&nbsp;6/5: 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 2/1&nbsp;4/3: 9/8 &nbsp; 6/5 &nbsp; 27/20 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 9/5 &nbsp;2/1<br/>&nbsp;3/2: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1&nbsp;8/5: 9/8 &nbsp; 5/4 &nbsp; 45/32 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 2/1&nbsp;9/5: 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 40/27 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1</p><p>mode 31/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1<br/>&nbsp;9/8: 10/9 &nbsp;32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 40/27 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp;2/1&nbsp;5/4: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 36/25 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;4/3: 9/8 &nbsp; 5/4 &nbsp; 27/20 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 15/8 &nbsp;2/1&nbsp;3/2: 10/9 &nbsp;6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp;2/1<br/>&nbsp;5/3: 27/25 6/5 &nbsp; 27/20 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;9/5: 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 25/18 40/27 5/3 &nbsp; 50/27 2/1<br/>mode 41/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 9/5 2/1&nbsp;9/8: 16/15 32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 40/27 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp;2/1<br/>&nbsp;6/5: 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 25/18 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 &nbsp;2/1&nbsp;4/3: 9/8 &nbsp; 5/4 &nbsp; 27/20 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 9/5 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;3/2: 10/9 &nbsp;6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp;2/1&nbsp;5/3: 27/25 6/5 &nbsp; 27/20 36/25 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp; 2/1<br/>&nbsp;9/5: 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 40/27 5/3 &nbsp; 50/27 2/1<br/>mode 51/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 15/8 2/1&nbsp;9/8 : 10/9 &nbsp;32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 64/45 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;5/4 : 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 32/25 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp; &nbsp;2/1<br/>&nbsp;4/3 : 9/8 &nbsp; 6/5 &nbsp; 45/32 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 15/8 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;3/2 : 16/15 5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;8/5 : 75/64 5/4 &nbsp; 45/32 25/16 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;15/8: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 64/45 8/5 &nbsp; 128/75 2/1</p><p>mode 61/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 8/5 15/8 2/1&nbsp;9/8 : 16/15 32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 64/45 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;6/5 : 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 25/16 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;4/3 : 9/8 &nbsp; 6/5 &nbsp; 45/32 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 9/5 &nbsp; &nbsp;2/1<br/>&nbsp;3/2 : 16/15 5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;8/5 : 75/64 5/4 &nbsp; 45/32 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 &nbsp; 2/1&nbsp;15/8: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 32/25 64/45 8/5 &nbsp; 128/75 2/1<br/>mode 71/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 9/5 2/1<br/>&nbsp;9/8: 10/9 &nbsp;32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 64/45 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1&nbsp;5/4: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 32/25 36/25 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp;2/1&nbsp;4/3: 9/8 &nbsp; 6/5 &nbsp; 27/20 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 15/8 2/1&nbsp;3/2: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1<br/>&nbsp;8/5: 9/8 &nbsp; 5/4 &nbsp; 45/32 25/16 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 2/1&nbsp;9/5: 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 25/18 40/27 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1<br/>mode 81/1 9/8 6/5 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1&nbsp;9/8 : 16/15 32/27 4/3 &nbsp; 40/27 5/3 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1<br/>&nbsp;6/5 : 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 25/18 25/16 5/3 &nbsp; 15/8 2/1&nbsp;4/3 : 9/8 &nbsp; 5/4 &nbsp; 45/32 3/2 &nbsp; 27/16 9/5 &nbsp;2/1&nbsp;3/2 : 10/9 &nbsp;5/4 &nbsp; 4/3 &nbsp; 3/2 &nbsp; 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1&nbsp;5/3 : 9/8 &nbsp; 6/5 &nbsp; 27/20 36/25 8/5 &nbsp; 9/5 &nbsp;2/1<br/>&nbsp;15/8: 16/15 6/5 &nbsp; 32/25 64/45 8/5 &nbsp; 16/9 2/1</p><p>Marcel</p></div>
