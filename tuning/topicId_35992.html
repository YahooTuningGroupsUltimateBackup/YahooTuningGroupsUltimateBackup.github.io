Sorry about that. At first, 04 seemed to be the favorite, Then 07<br/>&gt;&gt; moved up, as I remember. Also, 07 was the one that appeared low on some<br/>&gt;&gt; occasions. Okay, Paul, do what you think best. Want to include 403.542 and<br/>&gt;&gt; 403.742 this time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;m just wondering why you think no one liked jerry01 before. it<br/>&gt; seems to me that precise tuning is making virtually no difference,<br/>&gt; but i&apos;ll keep making more jerries so we can find out for sure, if you<br/>&gt; really wish.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t know, Paul. In my wish of wishes, we would find a frequency that<br/>&quot;locks&quot; with the JI illusion. Not finding one doesn&apos;t belie the obvious (to<br/>me, at least) that singers sing a third higher than ET and that there is a<br/>&quot;right&quot; place to put it.</p><p>At least, your efforts have demonstrated that a well-tuned JI third produces<br/>the impression of a &quot;high&quot; third (at least to Joe and I consciously and to<br/>Bob subconsciously). For that I thank you very much.</p><p>Why jerry01 was not more popular I cannot say. Just keep in mind that the<br/>closer one gets to a perfect 1:2 interval the more the turbulence, until it<br/>actually focuses and &quot;locks.&quot; Maybe that&apos;s the case here. You don&apos;t know<br/>you&apos;re close until it hits you in the ear. I don&apos;t know. What do you think?</p><p>My impressions were that most of the jerries were &quot;in the ball park.&quot; Yet,<br/>none of them were &quot;right on.&quot; It would be a shame to stop if we are on the<br/>brink. It&apos;s your time and effort, babe. You call the shot.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=35998 href="#35998">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2002 9:46:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My suggest would be to explore the &quot;space&quot; immediately higher<br/>and lower<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than jerry07.
