The tuning-related material deals mainly<br/>with fuzzy logic, optimization, and the representation<br/>of tunings and scales in general.  In particular, there<br/>are detailed algorithms for tuning definition,<br/>optimization and adaptive (unstable) tuning, as well as<br/>treatments of other topics, e.g., temperament.<br/>Most of the tuning-related material is in section 5.5 of<br/>the thesis  (The Underlying Physical Forms: Pitch and<br/>Pitch Organization); the short paper gives an overview<br/>of the work as a whole, but does not deal with tuning<br/>directly.  Since members&apos; interests in music are, no<br/>doubt, wide ranging, many might find the rest of the<br/>thesis interesting as well.  everything is at:<br/><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html">http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html</a><br/>Please let me know what you think---I&apos;m eager to hear<br/>your opinions.</p><p>-m</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/12/2001 9:33:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; everything is at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html">http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html</a></p><p>This link doesn&apos;t work for me.</p></div><h3>Michael Saunders &#x3C;michaelsaunders7@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2001 3:50:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;everything is at:<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html">http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html</a></p><p>&gt;This link doesn&apos;t work for me.<br/>&gt;   From: <a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a></p><p>I&apos;m sorry about that---Fortunecity isn&apos;t very reliable.<br/>It was working for me just now, Sunday morning, ~11am cst.<br/>I hope you get to see it!</p><p>-----------------------------Michael Saunders<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2001 8:56:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22647">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22647</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;everything is at:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html">http://members.fortunecity.com/odradek5/pp/rustyprogress.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This link doesn&apos;t work for me.<br/>&gt; &gt;   From: paul@s...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry about that---Fortunecity isn&apos;t very reliable.<br/>&gt; It was working for me just now, Sunday morning, ~11am cst.<br/>&gt; I hope you get to see it!</p><p>I went there last night and it worked fine.<br/>Downloaded the whole thesis - look forward to reading it.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/14/2001 4:08:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Michael!</p><p>Though I&apos;d like at some point to look at your paper in more detail, a<br/>quick skim shows that we are in agreement on many point which I often<br/>find myself debating on this list. I have to admit, though, that I<br/>pretty much skipped to one section of interest. So please forgive<br/>this knee-jerk reaction to the section. I&apos;m playing devil&apos;s advocate<br/>here (though I really believe what I say below).</p><p>As I see it, the three compositional paradigms you present<br/>(Pythagorean, Equal-Temperament, and JI) are not the three most<br/>important ones, even by the criteria you name. In fact there is<br/>another paradigm that I was surprised to see omitted not only because<br/>of its importance, but because in many ways it&apos;s a more<br/>inherently &quot;fuzzy&quot; tuning than the ones you name. I am speaking, of<br/>course, of the meantone paradigm.</p><p>The meantone paradigm was employed by composers beginning in the 15th<br/>century, supplanding the Pythagorean paradigm that had exclusive<br/>importance for centuries prior. The meantone paradigm had about 99.9%<br/>importance in Western music of the 16th and 17th centuries, declining<br/>in the 18th century, and the Equal Temperament paradigm began to<br/>overtake it in the 19th century.</p><p>In the meantone paradigm, notation is the same as in the Pythagorean<br/>paradigm, and the meaning of fifths and fourths in ratio terms is the<br/>same (fuzzily speaking), but there&apos;s an important difference. While<br/>thirds and sixths were not considered stable consonant sonorities in<br/>the Pythagorean era, in the meantone era they were, and they<br/>approximate the following ratios:</p><p>major sixth -- 5:3<br/>major third -- 5:4<br/>minor third -- 6:5<br/>minor sixth -- 8:5</p><p>Now the inherent fuzziness of this paradigm is clear from the<br/>following calculation. Starting from A as 1/1, the perfect fourth up<br/>is D at 4/3, and the perfect fourth up from D is G at 4/3 * 4/3 =<br/>16/9. But starting again from A as 1/1, the minor third up is C at<br/>6/5, and the perfect fifth up from C is G at 6/5 * 3/2 = 9/5. The two<br/>pitches for G (9/5 and 16/9) differ by the ratio of 81/80<br/>(the &quot;syntonic comma&quot; or &quot;comma&quot;) Composers in the meantone paradigm,<br/>however, did not distinguish the two versions of the note G, or the<br/>two and more versions of every pitch that would arise from such a<br/>construction. Rather, they clearly operated on a fuzzy notion of what<br/>these ratios were, allowing a few cents deviation (especially in<br/>melodic intervals) from the ideal consonant ratios. In particular,<br/>the perfect fourth was typically _widened_ by an indefinite amount,<br/>the perfect fifth _narrowed_, and the minor third often but not<br/>always _narrowed_, so that the two versions of the note G above would<br/>come out to the same pitch (fuzzily speaking). Note that none of the<br/>consonances need to be altered by more than a quarter of a comma if a<br/>fixed-pitch instrument is used; if flexible-pitch instruments are<br/>used, none of the consonances need to be altered at all unless all<br/>four notes (A, C, D, G) are played simultaneously, and a<br/>melodic &quot;fuzziness&quot; of about a quarter of a comma in each pitch can<br/>accomodate the paradigm instead.</p><p>In the beginning of your section on Just Intontation, you write,</p><p>&quot;Since it is the tuning which is most often consonant&quot;.</p><p>Now there are some problems with this statement. I assume that<br/>consonance is to be a fuzzy characteristic, so that small deviations<br/>of a fraction of a comma will only slightly reduce the truth-value of<br/>whether one of the consonant ratios mentioned above is still<br/>consonant. In particular, the diatonic scale in fixed meantone<br/>temperament will have more consonant thirds, and consonant triads,<br/>than any fixed tuning of the diatonic scale in JI. Furthermore, if<br/>the tuning is not fixed, a meantone paradigm will allow for the same<br/>degree of consonance (that is, perfection) as a JI paradigm but with<br/>a much smaller degree of fuzziness in the size of notated intervals<br/>and pitches.</p><p>I&apos;ll stop now for surely you know most or all of the above, and you<br/>can help me focus in on what aspect of these issues might be relevant<br/>for your project, if any. Also, feel free to change the subject and<br/>ask about any other aspect of tuning theory/practice that you might<br/>be interested in learning about/getting more feedback on.</p><p>Congratulations on the great work and looking forward to many<br/>stimulating discussions to come!</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
