But I did invent<br/>&gt; &gt;such a scale, and posted its C scale here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the message # of that post?  Or could you reproduce the<br/>&gt; scale in this thread?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>Here&apos;s the manual scale in just-temperament cents:</p><p>                                   7                        7<br/>                                           7<br/>C 0  C# 84  D 200  D#/Eb 268  E 384  F 468  F# 584  G 700  G#/Ab 768  A 900<br/>A#/Bb 968<br/>Split-digitals:    7<br/> 7                          7<br/>                +/-155                       400      500                 668<br/>                 +/-855<br/>                or 168*<br/>                         or 868*<br/>B 1084   C2 1200<br/>                     7<br/>   1100        1168</p><p>*Requires less tone generators. This C scale has 6 harmonic-minor 7th chords<br/>and 7 harmonic 9th chords--C through B. The F harmonic 7th or 9th chord is<br/>minus its A note.</p><p>Since the F chord begining on 500 is also needed to play most music, the F<br/>scale 500 cents higher is also needed. And sometimes the G scale 700 cents<br/>higher. Occassionaly a b scale is needed, as ii, iii, vi, and possibly vii<br/>are sometimes flatted as major chords. Thus my organ has three maanuals, each<br/>tuned to a different scale.<br/>It&apos;s tonally split at Middle C for maximum stop use.</p><p>Twelve key-signature stops determine which manual has which scale at any<br/>given time. Manual 1 has 5b and 1#. Manual 2 has 6b, 4b, 2b, c, d, e. Manual<br/>three has Eb, F and A  The B manual scale hasn&apos;t been assigned nor installed<br/>yet, as it&apos;s rarely used..</p><p>The split-digital scales notes are:<br/>For manual 1 Db/G. Manual 2 Gb/C, Af/D, Bb/E. Manual 3: F/B, Eb/A. Scales an<br/>augmented 4th apart have two notes identical. So two split-digital scales<br/>notes will fit onto 12 split digitals per octave.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.

I chose the E 384 cent value so the large<br/>minor 7th used with it would be 984 cents, one cent larger than 30/17. As<br/>providing a harmonic minor 7th for it, which is rarely used, would require<br/>more tone generators. So whatever name you call it, it&apos;s still just<br/>tempermanet, and sounds so.</p><p>However, it&apos;s true the tone generators are tuned to the 12-ET scale frequency<br/>divided. The difference is, one is used for the root and 5ths, another for<br/>the major 3rds, and anoter for the harmonic minor 7ths. All interlaced so the<br/>right pitches go to the right notes--very complicated wiring to say the<br/>least.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested (as would many &gt; others here, I&apos;m sure) to here how you<br/>&gt; arrived at this scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>It appears most devise a scale, then compose music to fit it. I used the<br/>opposite approach. As I wanted a scale that would play music already composed<br/>very long since for tempered scales based on 12 notes per octave.</p><p>So I used four-part harmony compositions, mainly hymns, to see what just<br/>pitches were actually used, how, where, and how often. It took years of<br/>experimentation to figure it all out for hundreds of such pieces in several<br/>hymnbooks. I did very much calculation with several hand calculators that<br/>wore out in the process. I finally settled on the scale I posted here as the<br/>best and practical solution.</p><p>Part of that solution was the revelation that music isn&apos;t composed via just<br/>one just scale for the whole piece, but several scales being used from phrase<br/>to phrase! Thus one phrase in a C piece might use the F scale when the IV<br/>chord is needed, the next phrsee might use the C scale for the V7, and the<br/>next phrse the G scale for the II7,   and the next a flated-chord scale, and<br/>so forth.</p><p>So I added the split digitals to minimize the complexity of playing different<br/>scales, and reducing the need to change manuals while playing.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.
