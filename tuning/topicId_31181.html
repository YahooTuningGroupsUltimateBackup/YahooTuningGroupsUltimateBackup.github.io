SZABO&apos;S ANALYSIS</p><p>The question was raised by Arpad Szabo in the II part of his &quot;The beginnings<br/>of Greek Mathematics&quot; (D.Reidel, &apos;74), where he sets out to show how the<br/>pre-Eudoxian theory of proportions initially took place in the Pythagorean<br/>theory of music.</p><p>He supported this thesis with a deep analysis of the Greek technical terms<br/>of the theory (diasteeme, oroi, analogon, logos, etc.) and their recognition<br/>in the supposedly Pythagorean experimental practice of a string stretched<br/>across a ruler, the socalled &quot;canon&quot;, divided in 12 parts. Here the<br/>Pythagoreans found three main consonances: the &apos;octave&apos; (diplasion, 12:6),<br/>the &apos;fourth&apos; (epitriton, 12:9 or 8:6) and the &apos;fifth&apos; (emiolion, 12:8 or<br/>9:6).</p><p>This musical theory was explicitly connected by Architas with the means:<br/>&quot;Now there are three means in music...&quot;: arithmetic a-b=b-c, geometric<br/>a:b=b:c, harmonic or subcontrary a-b:a = b-c:c. (DK 47 B2)<br/>However the first and third can be easily recognized in the fourth (such as<br/>C-F) and the fifth (such as C-G) consonances, whereas the geometric mean<br/>does not correspond to any consonance on the &quot;canon&quot;, for it would yield<br/>12:(6*radical(2)) or (6*radical(2)):6. With the word of Szabo (174): &quot;an<br/>octave cannot be divided into two equal subintervals by a number&quot;. Remark<br/>than here &apos;equal&apos; (in consonance) means &apos;proportional&apos; (on the canon&apos;s<br/>intervals), according to the logarithmic relationship between lengths and<br/>tones on a string in our &quot;equal temperament&quot;.</p><p>I want to remark however that the geometric mean is the natural<br/>relationship between the different octaves and hence seems even a sort of<br/>natural consonance, and that Aristotle (Rose, fragm. 43) recognized instead<br/>that only the arithmetical and the harmonic means were related to musical<br/>harmony.</p><p>Szabo did not ascribe to the Pythagorean theory of music &quot;more than a start&quot;<br/>(171): the full development of the theory of proportions had to be found in<br/>the &quot;geometrical arithmetic of the Pythagoreans&quot;, where a crucial role was<br/>played by the definition of &quot;similar (omoioi) plane numbers&quot; as &quot;those which<br/>have their sides proportional (analogon)&quot; (Euclides&apos; Elements , def VII,21).</p><p>Szabo moreover conjectures that &quot;the concepts of the musical theory of<br/>proportions were applied first of all in arithmetic... Furthermore the<br/>application of this theory to geometrical arithmetic contributed towards an<br/>understanding of the problem of geometric similarity, and this problem in<br/>turn soon led to the problem of linear incommensurability&quot; (173-4).<br/>This displacement of the problem from music to geometry, to be ascribed in<br/>my opinion probably to Archytas himself, was even the rationale of the name<br/>of the &apos;geometrical&apos; mean, because it could produce no musical consonances,<br/>whereas had precise and easy geometrical instances.</p><p>I think that probably it is wrong to look for the &apos;first&apos; proof of the<br/>incommensurability, even because the numerical &apos;fact&apos; of some<br/>incommensurable results (for example side and diagonal of the square) was<br/>already known to the Babylonians, whereas a rigorous proof required instead<br/>the introduction of the &quot;absurd&quot; proof in an earlier visual and constructive<br/>mathematics, so that the theorem had to be proved together with the<br/>establishment of its method of proof.</p><p>However it is of great relevance the hypothesis of a &apos;musical&apos; background<br/>for the discovery. And actually a &apos;negative&apos; proposition, asserting the<br/>incommensurability in musical and arithmetic terms, can be found in the<br/>prop.3 of the &quot;Sectio Canonis&quot;, ascribed to Euclid (Appendix).</p><p>The same proposition can be found in Boethius&apos; &quot;De Institutione Musica&quot;<br/>iii,11 (DK 47 A19), ascribed to Archytas: &quot;No mean proportional number can<br/>ever be found between two numbers in a ratio superparticularis&quot;. &apos;Ratio<br/>superparticularis&apos; is the &apos;epimorion diasteema (logos)&apos;, i.e. the ratio<br/>n+1:n or mn+m:nm, for n,m integers (Appendix).</p><p>In such proof some theorems in the arithmetic books of Euclid (VII, VIII and<br/>IX usually partially ascribed to the Pythagoreans) are implicit, such as<br/>VIII, 20: &quot;If one mean proportional number fall between two numbers, the<br/>numbers will be similar plane numbers&quot;.</p><p>A possible reconstruction of the missing steps could be found if we<br/>cut-and-paste of the proofs of the propositions VIII.9, VIII.11 and VIII.20,<br/>to prove something like &quot;If one mean proportional number fall between two<br/>numbers, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio of these two<br/>numbers must be square numbers&quot;, and furthermore it is easy to show that two<br/>consecutive numbers can not be both square, and this completes the proof.<br/>A similar and detailed reconstruction of the proof is in Knorr&apos;s &quot;The<br/>evolution of the Euclidean Elements&quot; (VII.1).<br/>For n=1 in the ratio superparticularis the above results prove the<br/>inexistence of an integer x such that 2m:x=x:m and then such that<br/>2:x/m=x/m:1.</p><p>This &apos;negative&apos; result in Archytas&apos; form derived probably by some &apos;evident&apos;<br/>impossibility, which was credibly progressively substituted by a rigorous<br/>&apos;proof by absurd&apos; according to the Euclidean style, such as the spurious<br/>X.117 of the Elements (Appendix).</p><p>Szabo&apos;s conclusion is that &quot;from a historical point of view the Greeks<br/>originally thought of the problem of irrationality as belonging to the<br/>theory of proportions. I hope that part II has shown how the theory of<br/>proportions, whose initial development took place in the Pythagorean theory<br/>of music, may in fact have led by way of arithmetic to the problem of<br/>geometrical similarity and thence to problem of linear commensurability...We<br/>have not yet shown how they reached the stage of being able to prove the<br/>existence of linear incommensurability in a rigorous manner&quot;</p></div>
