Moreover, the whole discussion had precisely the same flavor as the eternal discussions over the best equal division representation of this or than just intonation. But with some of the moderation that comes with age and more practical experience, I&apos;ve come &apos;round to the conclusion that any measurement unit is going to be based upon a quantity of some arbitrary local significance, for example the semitone or the octave.  Using cents, a familiar and de facto standard, has the charm that any examples in a text can be translated immediately into the practice of making real musical sounds.  Tuning devices and software are built with cent measurements and players in the western tradition are often trained to adjust intonation in cents.  (In my opinion western &quot;classical&quot; musicians should be trained in performing cent deviations from 12tet, tuning JI intervals through the 11th partial when singing or playing instruments with regular harmonic spectra, as well as to have the experience of performing in at least one historical european and one non-western tuning system).  Inasmuch as cents or saveurs or millioctaves or their alternatives can be translated from one another by the multiplication by a constant, then then the argument in favor of any single measure is trivial and unconvincing in the face of the more important argument that using cents can save one intellectual step and its requisite time in getting to the most urgent matter, which is making interesting music well.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=78460 href="#78460">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2008 4:38:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using cents,<br/>&gt; a familiar and de facto standard, has the charm that any examples in a<br/>&gt; text can be translated immediately into the practice of making real<br/>&gt; musical sounds.</p><p>I don&apos;t agree, if by &apos;real&apos; you mean &apos;non-electronic&apos;.<br/>Try translating the following immediately into &apos;real musical sounds&apos;,<br/>either melodically or harmonically:<br/>164 cents<br/>436 cents<br/>742 cents<br/>928 cents</p><p>- &apos;Unfair&apos; you might say, but why?</p><p>&gt; players in the western tradition are often trained to<br/>&gt; adjust intonation in cents.</p><p>I haven&apos;t come across this in practice, except for oboists checking<br/>their &apos;A&apos; on a meter.

In my case, as a trombonist, back in the dark ages<br/>of the mid-70s, even our suburban Californian  High School marching<br/>band instructor had each member of the band spend hours tuning to the<br/>needle of a strobotuner, and to this day my estimation of cent<br/>deviations is pretty accurate as a result of that practice. There is<br/>obviously a lot of ear AND muscle memory to reliably acquiring such<br/>skills, but I&apos;m convinced the best players share this. (I&apos;ve watched<br/>rehearsal conducted by Pierre Boulez, Hans Zender, and Paul Zukofsky<br/>in which the conductors corrected intonation by specifying cent<br/>changes for individual players).</p><p>In new music contexts, notating cent deviations, with or without the<br/>use of an electronic tuner, is frequently the most efficient way to<br/>do complex tunings. A good example is that of the Arditti Quartet, by<br/>some measures the best such ensemble of our time. Alvin Lucier and<br/>Walter Zimmermann happen to have written quartets for the Arditti<br/>about the same time featuring beating.  Lucier asked for cent<br/>deviations from 12tet, and Zimmermann notated just ratios. In both<br/>live concerts and in recordings, the Lucier quartet always works,<br/>with the progressive reduction in beat rate completely vivid. The<br/>Zimmermann, on the other hand, is so dependent on a large number of<br/>local variables, chief among which is the performing environment<br/>which determines, to a large extent, whether and how well the<br/>instruments can hear each other, that it has only been successful in<br/>studio recordings using headsets with recorded reference pitches. If<br/>Zimmermann had noted cents deviations in addition to the ratios, I<br/>believe that the concert performances would have been much more<br/>successful.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard, famously around these parts, seems to be very<br/>successful with singers, string and wind players using cents for more<br/>complex tunings, and James Tenney&apos;s well-known _Critical Band__ is<br/>wisely notated, AFAIC, with both ratios and cents.</p><p>That said, for a less complex just intonation, i.e. with a limited<br/>number of total pitches used, relatively slow introduction of<br/>pitches, using a 7 limit or perhaps a few intervals from an 11 limit,<br/>and in which absolute pitch height is not fixed (as was in the<br/>Zimmermann for the fixed beating rates) then a just intonation<br/>notation of ratios or Helmholtz-Ellis style is perfectly adequate.</p><p>djw</p></div><h3><a id=78464 href="#78464">ðŸ”—</a>Tony &#x3C;leopold_plumtree@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2008 11:42:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Someone should probably mention that Erv Wilson typically<br/>&gt; uses octaves rather than cents.

But the fact is that cents are so<br/>strongly related to 12-EDO (or 12-tET, or however you want to<br/>abbreviate it; there seem to be numerous ways of writing it!) that I<br/>see a very strong bias there. That a &quot;true&quot; fifth is 702 cents and<br/>a &quot;true&quot; major third is whatever 322x1.2 cents comes to (I&apos;ve learned<br/>it by now in moc.!) while an ET fifth is the round number of 700<br/>cents and an ET major third is the round number of 400 cents shows<br/>this.</p><p>Just like the fact that I can understand feet more intuitively than<br/>meters, because I&apos;ve been using feet &amp; inches all my life and only<br/>met with meters in my lab classes in school, you feel more<br/>comfortable with cents. But for the purposes of the things I discuss<br/>in my book, it&apos;s easier to compute (in my head!) that 91 moc. is 1/11<br/>of an octave or that 143 moc. is 1/7 of an octave than to compute the<br/>corresponding numbers in cents. And if you&apos;d memorized that a perfect<br/>fifth was 585 moc. your &quot;how large is that?&quot; moment would never occur.<br/>I know already that 322 moc. is a just major third and 585 moc. is a<br/>Pythagorean fifth, just by working with them a bit. You would too, if<br/>you were interested enough to work with them for just a short while.</p><p>And I must admit, I don&apos;t have perfect pitch. So if I wanted to<br/>generate a note 400 moc. above middle C, I&apos;d probably have to program<br/>it on a computer or a synthesizer.

I, for one, have no problem in notating simultaneously in Helmholz/Ellis, ratios, and cents if that will get the job done, and I believe that some combination will probably reach a greater number of musicians.  What is not helpful, AFAIC, are notations in which intervals are spelled inconsistantly or arguments over altervatives to cents which, for non-tuning specialists, are the equivalent over arguments over the numbers of angels on pinheads.
