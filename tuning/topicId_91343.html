But overall I think it<br/>stands poised to eventually become the best<br/>music-notation program yet made. And keep in mind<br/>that right now it is only up to version 0.9.6<br/>... so it&apos;s still alpha.</p><p>My Linux version is a bit older, so i will have to<br/>try the microtune plugin on Windows.
