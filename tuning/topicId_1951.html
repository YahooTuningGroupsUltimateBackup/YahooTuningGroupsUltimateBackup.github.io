I eventually<br/>&gt; ended up using all but 5 of a series of 34 fifths, each<br/>&gt; tempered by 1/9 of a schisma. Parts of the retuned<br/>&gt; piece are questionable, but in other cases this tuning<br/>&gt; made a noticeable improvement. . . Both versions<br/>&gt; are up on my web page now for comparison.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a></p><p>A very nice piece.  I like the retuned version much<br/>better than the 12-Eq, with one exception.  The part<br/>which I felt was the best in the piece in the 12-Eq<br/>version, the piano arpeggio right before the trumpet<br/>cadenza, didn&apos;t work well in the retuning.  But everything<br/>else sounded better, IMO.</p><p>The skismatic tuning gave the piece a much softer,<br/>pretter sound.</p><p>-Monzo</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=1952 href="#1952">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/1999 11:37:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; re: Henry Miller&apos;s &quot;The Star-Crystals of Telaras&quot;,<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a></p><p>After a few more listenings, I like the<br/>29 out of 34 Skhismatic Temperament version<br/>better all the way thru over the 12-Eq.</p><p>In addition to that piano arpeggio/trumpet<br/>cadenza part, I was also listening particularly<br/>for the difference in the sections from<br/>measures 8-9 and 13-17.
