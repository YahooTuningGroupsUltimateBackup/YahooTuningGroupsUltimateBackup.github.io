You&apos;re a true<br/>experimental scalesmith full of surprising ideas.&quot;<br/>  You know it might not be a bad idea and thank you.  Thing is I would probably need a lot of supports from tuning experts (particularly those on this list) along with people on the forefront of composing with new tunings (such as yourself, along with all-important song samples of the scales being used well) to really get anywhere with it.  I certainly want it to come across as proven and not just me on my soapbox.</p><p>     I will summarize the PHI section, Silver section, and 7-tone Ptolemic scale along with the 12-tone version I just posted along with a few other scales (including a few of my old pure-JI ones) in a future posting.</p><p>    The thrust of ideas in these scales are (in general)<br/>A) Adherence to the critical band in root tones (one thing IMVHO all too often ignored)...this I&apos;ve found to hover around 1.08 (13/12) to 1.09 (12/11) minimum.  This often causes scales to lean a bit toward ET configurations.<br/>B)  Periodicity (the obvious one and the basis of JI as I see it) of both root tones and harmonics<br/>C) Symmetrical sections (the extreme case is Silver and PHI section scale where each note in the scale splits two other ALA the way the golden ratio does in architecture and supposedly the way we read human facial proportion attractiveness).   This also relates to &quot;mirroring&quot; notes around well-known intervals IE the mirror of 4/3 around 2/1 is 1.77777 since (4/3 over 3/2) * 2/1 = 1.777777.<br/>D) Symmetry in difference tones IE dyads beat at rates that are either fractional multiples or sections of each other.</p><p>   Of those four I usually see leading scales following B.   My sections scales focus on C and D (the Silver also adds a tad of B) plus the Ptolemic-ratio-based ones focus on A,B,C and D, for example.  The other thing is I&apos;m going to have to make sure I&apos;m at some sort of a resting point where I feel fairly close to finding some sort of final &quot;answer&quot;...right now for every new thing I find out psycho-acoustically I figure old scales need to be tweaked yet again. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=87061 href="#87061">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2010 10:23:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>I suggest opening an account on the xenharmonic wiki if you haven&apos;t already.</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/introduction">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/introduction</a></p><p>That would give you a neutral host to put your ideas down in type.</p><p>I&apos;d bet the experts here would help you.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Fri, Mar 26, 2010 at 12:45 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Michael, I have enough trouble keeping up with your various scales! :D<br/>&gt; One day you should really consider writing a comprehensive guide to all your<br/>&gt; work, I think it would be fascinating to read.
