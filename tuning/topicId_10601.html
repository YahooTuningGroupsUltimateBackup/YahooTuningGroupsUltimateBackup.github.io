It&apos;s the result of an circular chain of 8 perfect fithts<br/>&gt;and 4 fifths which are each tempered by a quarter of a Pythagorean<br/>&gt;comma. The tempered  fifths are C-G, G-D, D-A and B-F#.  The deviations<br/>&gt;in cents may perhaps be calculated in a more precise way.  Right now<br/>&gt;the pure fifth is considered to be 702 cents and the Puthagorean<br/>&gt;comma 24 cents.</p><p>Yes, I see better now the serviceability of Werckmeister III than when<br/>I shot off that &quot;strange&quot; comment.</p><p>&gt;Werckmeister III is not an attempt to obtain the ideal tuning for a<br/>&gt;singular piece, as you did marvellously well with Mozart&apos;s KV 606. (I<br/>&gt;listened to it many times!).</p><p>Glad you like it!</p><p>&gt;As all Well-temperaments, Werckmeister III offers a solution to play<br/>&gt;reasonably in tune in all of the twelve keys, both minor and major. It<br/>&gt;becomes specially interesting when you listen to a set of pieces in<br/>&gt;many different keys, like Bach&apos;s two-part Inventions, the three-part<br/>&gt;Sinfonias or the Well-tempered clavier. Each key has it&apos;s own tuning<br/>&gt;characteristics. You can hear for example, without being absolute, if a<br/>&gt;piece is in D major or in Eb major.</p><p>&gt;Intuitively I think you will find about as much &apos;pain&apos; as in<br/>&gt;meantone-tuning.</p><p>I hear what you&apos;re saying, and it would be interesting to experience<br/>some of the works you cite in Werckmeister III tuning.  My guess<br/>(without yet having heard it) is that I&apos;d long for &quot;better&quot; tuning in<br/>the keys for which this fixed tuning is not so well suited, but in this<br/>respect my ears may be different from others&apos;.</p><p>Do you happen to know of any MIDI sequences tuned in this fashion?  I&apos;m<br/>sure listening to them would improve my education!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
