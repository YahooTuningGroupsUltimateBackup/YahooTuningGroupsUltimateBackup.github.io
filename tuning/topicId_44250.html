The<br/>presence of the 3 tones in a major triad which are _approximately_ in the<br/>frequency ratio 4:5:6 implies a fundamental tone, i.e. you kind of hear<br/>1:4:5:6.  In this case since 1 the same &quot;note&quot; as 4 but 2 octaves lower, you<br/>can say in effect that the 4 tone is heard as the root of the chord.</p><p>Therefore the important intervals to the ear are 4:5 and 4:6, major 3rd and<br/>major 5th.  Since the 5 tone is not the base, the 5:6 ration is not primary.</p><p>This also works with inversions.  If you play a C chord with G as the low<br/>note, your triad has the relationship 3:4:5.  Still this implies 1:3:4:5 and<br/>so the implied 1 or the actually present 4 is the root of the chord.</p><p>I&apos;m not going into all the full potential detail here, so let&apos;s see how that<br/>sits with you, and what needs clarification.  And this is just one way of<br/>saying it, and someone else may have a clearer answer.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3><a id=44252 href="#44252">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2003 8:27:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Here is my question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This has always puzzled me.
