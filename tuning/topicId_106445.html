I did a little research and I think I got the basics but any feedback from experts is appreciated.</p><p> First off I have Logic Pro X that has the Hermode tuning system built-in so I guess that is a goid start. I can tune Logic&apos;s internal sound and synths to it but - can it also tune external synths sending the midi through logic?<br/> I have an Oberheim Matrix 1000. From what I gathered at <a href="http://microtonal-synthesis.com">microtonal-synthesis.com</a> this synth may only be able to retune to a resolution of 1 cent. So, am I correct in assuming that it won&apos;t be precise just intonation never? Just intonation, to be orecise, has to be tuned to Hz, correct? Are there any synths that can tune themselves to Hz instead of cents? Soft or Hard synths that is. Does the Access Virus do this? I am mostly interested in creating the purest tones possible with a synth. I also looked at the Justonic Pitch Palette softwaee - is this a better option for me?</p><p> I am sorry for the basic questions but my knowledge of this is still limited. All I know is that I can definitely feel and hear a difference between equal tempered and just intonation and would like to make use of my synths as much as possible to create just intoned music.</p><p> BTW, I also have a Volca Keys synth but I guess there is no hope I can play that with just intonation is there? :) It responds to pitch bend so its resoltion must be 1 cent as well, so I guess it would be the same problem as with the Oberheim, correct? Just to emphasize, the ideal for me would be a synth tunable to the Hz, if possible.</p><p> Thank you everyone!</p></div><h3><a id=106448 href="#106448">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2015 1:50:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 16/01/15 10:14, helder_cunha@...

Timidity has high precision tuning and will work on Macintosh, at least from the command line.  Csound has high precision tuning, will certainly work on Macintosh, and will work with Hz directly, but you need to program it yourself.  It isn&apos;t a simple way of starting up.</p><p>Cents are a good deal better than nothing.</p><p>Pitch bends can potentially be used for high precision tuning.  Not all synths respond to this precision, though.  There are also problems with polyphony.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div>
