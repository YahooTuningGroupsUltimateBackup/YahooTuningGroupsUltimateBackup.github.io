Sounds like the kind of dream I could have had.</p><p>I was watching public television after the conclusion of the &quot;Jazz&quot; series. First was a show on<br/>Gunther Schuller, and he was teaching some students a piece he had written using Tunisian<br/>scales -- the string players (including harp!) were playing microtonal tunings. The next program, I<br/>can&apos;t even remember what it was since it was 5 in the morning, but lots of microtonal music was<br/>going on in the background. Then I fell asleep to a Penderecki CD -- all microtonal.</p></div>
