I&apos;ve come across the<br/>phrase &quot;procrustean bed&quot; many, many times because Schoenberg<br/>used it in describing his lingering rejection of tonality in<br/>his 2nd Quartet (which I&apos;ve studied a lot).  I never bothered<br/>to look up the Greek myth from whence the term originated.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=21071 href="#21071">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/14/2001 9:42:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20895.html#20895">/tuning/topicId_20895.html#20895</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;In Greek myth, Procrustes was a giant who ran a hotel of sorts,<br/>&gt; although sad to say, his hospitality skills weren&apos;t exactly the<br/>best.<br/>&gt; Procrustes forced his guests to spend the night on an iron bed, and<br/>&gt; if they were too long for the bed, he lopped off their legs; if<br/>they<br/>&gt; were too short, he stretched them until they fit.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This refers to something intended to enforce conformity in an<br/>&gt; inflexible, arbitrary way.

Actually, in all fairness, it wasn&apos;t the Clairmont&apos;s<br/>problem, but what were all those wild kids with beer bottles in the<br/>halls all about??</p><p>_______ _____ _______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
