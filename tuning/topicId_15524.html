This would make them occupy a<br/>prohibitively large amount of memory. So I guess the MIDI approach is the<br/>only reasonable one.</p><p>Well, the hexany with .wav clips came to about 1.63 Mb uncompressed, for<br/>26 audio clips. That&apos;s for 1 sec each, 16 bit, 22050 Hz, = format I chose to<br/>reduce the size while keeping quality fairly reasonable.</p><p>Would be getting on for three times that for each model if you did them all,<br/>or just a bit over that if you did just the tetrads and triads.</p><p>So based on my exp.with the hexany, I&apos;d have thought doing just the<br/>tetads and triads would prob. be okay. Even with them all, would be<br/>less than 6 Mb, which isn&apos;t so much nowadays. I don&apos;t know whether<br/>they would all be kept in memory or played from disk as needed.</p><p>&gt;As for rotating the cylinder, I wrote a program in Matlab that finds the<br/>simplest rotation that gets an object from one configuration to another, but<br/>it uses Matlab&apos;s optimization toolbox . . . I guess I could just run this<br/>for all the configurations in question . . . write me offline if you&apos;d like<br/>my help on this.</p><p>I think the 3)5 dekany is the problem here. For the 2)5, I think one would<br/>soon get used to how the spheres work, with the colour coding, and the<br/>feedback one gets from hearing the sounds, plus the very clear 3D<br/>tetrahedra that make up this model.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried a fair number of variations on the 3)5 dekany this evening.</p><p>Tried tetrahedra for the triads. That gave a really nice stationary model,<br/>but as soon as you try to turn it, you get rather confused with all the<br/>extra straight lines.</p><p>So I think it is better to keep to spheres for the tetrads for this model.</p><p>See what you think - here are the two models:</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads_0p25.wrl">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads_0p25.wrl</a></p><p>and<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads_tetrahedra_for_tetrads_0p25.wrl">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads_tetrahedra_for_tetrads_0p25.wrl</a></p><p>What I feel is that the tetrahedra distract one from the basic shape of<br/>the dekany as one turns the model. While the spheres, not being angular<br/>at all, let one focus more clearly on the dekany.</p><p>Notice I&apos;ve left out a lot of the spheres in these models. That&apos;s because<br/>now you can click on the faces themselves for the triads.</p><p>Also made the diads smaller.</p><p>I think it would work, given the extra feedback from hearing the sounds.</p><p>&gt;it uses Matlab&apos;s optimization toolbox . . . I guess I could just run this<br/>for all the configurations in question . . . write me offline if you&apos;d like<br/>my help on this.</p><p>Right, been doing essentially the same thing then!</p><p>Yes, one can always reduce any number of rotations in 3D to a single rotation,<br/>or a translation.</p><p>If you move an object from one place to another in 3D, you can always do it<br/>with a single translation, or a single rotation about one axis, whatever it&apos;s<br/>start and end orientation. Kind of remarkable result, that one can do that!</p><p>It&apos;s okay thanks, I can do it in c / java if it needs to be done, and have almost<br/>all the code there, prob. only need to change a few lines in my VRML viewpoints<br/>applet / windows prog., in order to change the start vector from 0 0 -1 to 0 1 0.</p><p>The template files are<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads.txt">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads.txt</a><br/>and<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads_tetrahedra_for_tetrads.txt">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/dekany3_with_diads_faces_for_triads_tetrahedra_for_tetrads.txt</a></p><p>and you will need the latest version of</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.exe">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.exe</a></p><p>or</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.c">http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/tune_smithy/dekany/srvrml.c</a></p><p>to replace some of the equations.</p><p>Would indeed be nice if you were to do them now. Be sure to let me know if anything needs clarifying,<br/>off-line if that seems best.</p><p>However if you wait a little while, I&apos;ll be doing the MIDI clips. Still have to finish FTS 1.09 first, and don&apos;t want to<br/>get involved in adding new features to it right now. Hopefully by next week it will be released, based on how<br/>it is going at present, but can never really say about such things...</p><p>I&apos;ll prob. call the code in svrml.c as a subroutine from FTS to do the S&amp;R to make the vrml dekany.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2000 9:27:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If you move an object from one place to another in 3D, you can always do it<br/>&gt;with a single translation, or a single rotation about one axis, whatever it&apos;s<br/>&gt;start and end orientation.
