We are using the words differently. It was really<br/>these that failed in my original thought more than AMM. But since that<br/>was mentioned , i had to vocalize my problems with that. In fact it is<br/>AMM ( along with the whole post scratch orchestra moment) who have been<br/>even more influential to music making than the other minimalists. The<br/>whole experimental english music scene  is still one of the strongest<br/>forces around. If you go into a store with an experimental section, they<br/>dominate it with those influenced by this &quot;school&quot;. Even much techno is<br/>coming out of this.<br/>    Minimalism was already in existence in the far east. It is a result<br/>of a cultural &quot;widening&quot; more than an &quot;evolutionary step. The examples<br/>of repetition, extended time and/or sonorities are too numerous to<br/>mention. The available technology of home tape machines also changed our<br/>way of making music. I for one as well as countless thousands of others<br/>played with loops because it was an obvious thing to do. I don&apos;t think<br/>we needed Riley to tell us it was there. In fact, i don&apos;t think i even<br/>heard in C until the late 70&apos;s, Reich&apos;s music being much more popular at<br/>the time. But the electronics of Hendrix was as influential as anything.</p><p>    I am sitting in the room seemed to be in this performance an<br/>arbitrary amplification of certain resonant frequencies that unless<br/>there was a conscious effort by the mike placement, just about any pitch<br/>in the room could come out. I am glad to hear he doesn&apos;t encourage live<br/>performances of which I am sure this factor might have some bering on<br/>it. Compositions become more and more inseparable from the composers<br/>themselves. I expect this to become more so as opposed to less.</p><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Kraig:_I am sitting in a room_ really does end up articulating the<br/>&gt; resonant frequencies of the room in which it was recorded (in the<br/>&gt; process, erasing the imperfections in his speech).
