I have<br/>no intention of trying to replace Scala at any point; this is just meant as<br/>a supplement for my own purposes - and if there&apos;s interest I&apos;d like to<br/>distribute it. Some input is desired about something here. Right now, I&apos;m<br/>supporting homophonic notation of the following sort:</p><p>&quot;6&amp;14 3&amp;11 0&amp;6&amp;14&amp;19 0&amp;-8.75&amp;4.5 0&amp;6&amp;11&amp;1/2&amp;3/4 3 6 11/5 7/4 3/2 5/4 6/5 3 6<br/>0 0&quot;</p><p>Not that it matters, but the above example string was set in 19-EDO. In the<br/>above, &quot;&amp;&quot; designates that multiple notes are played together, so e.g. &quot;0&amp;6&quot;<br/>is the dyad consisting of degrees 0 and 6 (tonic and mediant of the major<br/>scale in 19-EDO). You&apos;ll notice that note numbers can also be negative and<br/>fractional. Written ratios are always interpreted as interval ratios (not<br/>note numbers); numerators and denominators can be fractional as well, but of<br/>course not negative.</p><p>Now I am adding in chords written in identities and am wondering how to<br/>interpret the root and octave of the chord. For example, an octave-proper<br/>&quot;5:7:9&quot; might be considered for the purposes of the program as rooted at<br/>1/1, or 5/4, or 5/1. Also, it would be nice to be able to mark chord<br/>inversion simply without writing a new set of identities, but I&apos;m not sure<br/>how to do this for something like a hexad. There are probably other things<br/>I&apos;m not even aware of. I&apos;d hate to code this up and then realize it could<br/>have been done it better.</p><p>Another notation I&apos;m thinking of is &quot;[]&quot; to shift 1/1. Something like &quot;0&amp;6<br/>[11] 0&amp;6&quot; would mean &quot;play tonic and mediant; shift so that 11 (the<br/>dominant) becomes tonic; and then play tonic and mediant again in this new<br/>position&quot;. (Of course, it would also work on ratios.) The 11 would not be<br/>sounded,</p><p>What sort of sequence string would be most useful? Could someone perhaps<br/>provide an example of this sort that they think would work well? Feel free<br/>to change anything I&apos;ve already done; e.g. if you hate my use of &quot;&amp;&quot;, change<br/>it to whatever you like. Right now I&apos;m not interested in adding notation for<br/>rhythmic variation or anything like that but am currently just using this as<br/>a homophonic tuning tester. Still, feel free to mention any extensions you<br/>think would be useful, be they rhythm, timbre, glissando, etc. The guiding<br/>principles are simplicity and ease of use.</p></div>
