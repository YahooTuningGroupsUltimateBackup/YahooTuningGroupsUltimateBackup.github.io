(Also, this is not advocacy of<br/>anything, but asking genuine questions.)</p><p>In a I7-IV7-V7-I7 using all just 4:5:6:7 chords I expect nothing<br/>special, most of all nothing dissonant. The sevenths should be<br/>nothing but color. Not sure if this dense texture all the way<br/>through makes musical sense without a strong melodic excuse, but<br/>this is an<br/>experiment, o.k.?</p><p>Now exchange the 4:7 in the V7 for a 16:9. Which will make the<br/>better closure? The 16:9 has a dissonance that resolves into the<br/>next chord. The 7:4 has the better (well, narrower) voice<br/>leading.</p><p>Should a functional difference between the different sevenths<br/>turn up, would it be possible to convert the cadence<br/>unequivocally into a V7-I7-II#7-V7 sequence just by inserting<br/>the right kind of 7?</p><p>klaus schmirler</p></div>
