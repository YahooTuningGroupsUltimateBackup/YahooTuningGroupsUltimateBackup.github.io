I&apos;d been thinking of getting GPO for a while since I got my most recent Vista system, and this new upgrade made it even more attractive. So far I&apos;ve just been rendering MIDI files with it, so this doesn&apos;t show off the full potential of GPO, but it&apos;s at least giving me a good idea of its tuning capabilities. I uploaded two examples to my Xenharmonic Alliance page. The first one is a test of the 16-note lemba tuning, which I had to do as a full-octave tuning as it turns out that GPO repeats the scale at octaves (even if the Scala scale stops at half an octave). The second one, which I just uploaded, is a rendering of my old Mizarian Porcupine Overture (in 15-ET), played on strings, organ, trumpets, and harpsichord (with an extra harp part for some of the harpsichord notes that went out of range). I haven&apos;t figured out how the GPO percussion is set out yet so I did it without percussion. I used the equalizer on the harpsichord parts to suggest the sound of the quillophone and guitar from the original version.</p><p>It sounds pretty good as it is, but if I have the time I&apos;d like to try taking the organ parts and arranging them for brass and woodwinds, and working on the balance of the parts.</p></div><h3><a id=84429 href="#84429">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2009 7:25:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmonic.ning.com/profile/HermanMiller">http://xenharmonic.ning.com/profile/HermanMiller</a></p><p>Hi Herman,</p><p>Haven&apos;t you been critical of sites that require registration<br/>and don&apos;t let you download?
