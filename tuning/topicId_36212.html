Not sure which you mean, so here&apos;s both:</p><p>The one here in Files is indeed Victoria, so you nailed it. It&apos;s for<br/>antiphonal choirs as I&apos;m sure you must have noticed if that&apos;s the one<br/>you mean. The downloadable MP3 at our site is by Orlando Di Lasso and<br/>is a complete performance. Yahoo choked on the 1.1 meg file, though<br/>and said it was too large for the allotted space. The Di Lasso is as<br/>close to impeccable adaptive JI as you can get with voices no matter<br/>who you have in your choir, with very expressive dynamics, too.<br/>Happens once every couple of years (chuckle). Wish I could have<br/>uploaded it.</p><p>Thanks again, Joe!</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_36212.html#36212">/tuning/topicId_36212.html#36212</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi, all!
