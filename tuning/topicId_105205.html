References to this &quot;identical temperament&quot;<br/>occur in these messages I wrote, for example.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/105143">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/105143</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/105156">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/105156</a>&gt;</p><p>This suspicion first dawned on me when I linked in a<br/>list of parapyth and related tunings to a tuning on<br/>your site with unison vectors of 896:891, 352:351,<br/>364:363, and 10648:10647 based on 46-17-41, and<br/>assumed that it was (2/1, 703.723, 57.423) -- but<br/>checking the link quickly showed me that it wasn&apos;t!<br/>Rather, it was POTE parapyth (2/1, 703.856, 58.339).</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/105172">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/105172</a>&gt;</p><p>So I asked myself, &quot;Where can I find that file from<br/>Graham&apos;s site that was identical to the first canonical<br/>version of MET-24?&quot; I searched your site, and also the<br/>set of files I had downloaded, both the descriptive<br/>information and the Scala files.</p><p>I simply couldn&apos;t find it! And I looked through some<br/>of my command history to see what files I had moved<br/>or renamed -- no trace of the original from your site<br/>which had served as the basis of my Scala rotation<br/>for what I had thought was a Scala file from your<br/>site with a generator of 703.723 cents (or 496.277<br/>cents), as opposed to POTE Pele at 496.144 cents!</p><p>My tentative conclusion, subject to your correction,<br/>is that I may have done something in Scala like<br/>use SHOW SCALE for your original file, and gone on<br/>from there as if I had made it the current scale<br/>with LOAD. So if I had my 17-note subset of that<br/>&quot;canonical&quot; MET-24 loaded, I would have gone on<br/>using that, thinking it was an &quot;identical&quot; tuning<br/>which you or a computer using your algorithms had<br/>found!</p><p>A couple of analogies in the physical sciences<br/>occur to me. One would be reporting an exobiological<br/>breakthrough: bacteria found in a meteorite from<br/>some part of our Solar System; and soon having<br/>these &quot;extraterrestrial microbes&quot; turn out to be<br/>a bit of contamination from the lab.</p><p>A real-world analogy also occurred in Zambia, if I<br/>recall correctly, in 1976, where a paleobiologist<br/>found &quot;worm burrows&quot; in rocks about a billion years<br/>old. This report briefly became part of the scenario<br/>for studies of that geological era -- until another<br/>geologist, Preston Cloud, made a persuasive case<br/>that these &quot;burrows&quot; were actually signs of modern<br/>termites.</p><p>Graham, if I did simply confuse my tuning file with<br/>one of yours, my deepest apologies -- together with<br/>an acknowledgment that it was both moving and bracing<br/>in a very creative way to think that with our<br/>somewhat different methods and paradigms, we might<br/>both arrive at what I call MET-24.</p><p>To sum, my inability to locate any original file<br/>from your site with a generator of 703.723 or 496.277<br/>cents makes me ask whether or not you do have such<br/>a 46-17-41 tuning, or maybe I have goofed.</p><p>Either way, I thank you most warmly both for the<br/>vast resources of your site, and for your generosity<br/>in sharing them along with your advocacy of a paradigm<br/>which you have, along with others, done so much over<br/>the years to develop and refine.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
