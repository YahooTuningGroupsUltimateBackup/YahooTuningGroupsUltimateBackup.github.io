This thread started with the idea of<br/>the master degree being a universal standard.  That to play an instrument<br/>requires a certain type of training I&apos;ll go along with.  But the money thing<br/>with these schools is really out of hand and so I have to go for the throat,<br/>after all They are refusing to give people information if they won&apos;t cough up<br/>the dough. I&apos;ll agree there are libraries but even they are lacking. I don&apos;t<br/>know one of the above schools that has anything by Bosanquet. Also lets take<br/>Cardew, despite that we in the end lost him to politics, the man was more<br/>influential than any schools will admit. An entire British movement has<br/>developed out of both the Scratch Orchestra and his involvement with AMM. In<br/>the experimental section of most record stores (out here) we find the direct<br/>descendants Organum, Gavin Bryars (member of Scratch), and the next generation<br/>of Eno,Hafler trio,<br/>and countless others influences by all the above. This major movement occurs<br/>without even a footnote in most universities text This is not music of an upper<br/>class and so will be ignored since it inspires no conversations over tea!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; dante<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>Jon Southwood &#x3C;noj@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/1999 8:45:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; on information and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;attitudes that are there only to justify there own existence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That what makes a piece of music great is  1) found in only those elements than<br/>&gt; can be analyzed 2) its historical innovation in example being the first.

To say that serialism is a<br/>style would be to lump the musics of Webern, Dallapicola, Berg,<br/>Maxwell-Davies, (late) Stravinsky, Johnston, and (Keith) Emerson<br/>together.  That would be like lumping the fugues of Bach, Beethoven,<br/>Bartok and Webern together; or the sonatas of Corelli, Mozart, Brahms,<br/>Schnittke, Schoenberg, and Boulez.  &quot;Number games&quot;, as you put it, have<br/>been a part of music since the very early Renaissance (or even ancient<br/>Greece, for that matter--the Pythagorean tuning, as well as any tuning<br/>system, could easily be characterized as a &quot;number game&quot;).  The term<br/>&quot;number games&quot; may be an accurate term for some composers&apos; music (those<br/>for whom theory comes first), but I would argue that the &quot;number games&quot;<br/>you refer to are actually time honored techniques of variation for<br/>creating highly organic music, which is not just a characteristic of<br/>great Western Classical music (incl. Bach, Beethoven, Bartok,<br/>Schoenberg, Maxwell-Davies, Crumb, Stravinsky, Sweelink, Messiaen, and<br/>countless others) but also of musics elsewhere in the world, even<br/>improvised music where a theme is varied through various manipulations<br/>and glossings.  Composers have always been looking for ways of<br/>organizing their music, whether it be cantus firmus, fugue, dance forms,<br/>the so-called sonata-allegro form, passacaglia, stochastic methods,<br/>I-ching, dice, serialism, &quot;controlled&quot;-improvisation, total chance, but<br/>it is the composer who, in the end, stamps his or her &quot;style&quot; on the<br/>music.</p><p>&#x9;In order for this message to not be completely off-topic I have a<br/>question that relates serialism to Just Intonation. Not too long ago, I<br/>heard a recording of Johnston&apos;s String Quartet No. 2, which as you may<br/>or may not know is a serialized piece with a scale of 43(?) tones.  More<br/>accurately, the vertical intervals are serialized.  Are there any good<br/>references out there that deal with this sort of application of serial<br/>techniques to the pitches/intervals of a Just Intonation tuned system?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jon Southwood<br/><a href="mailto:noj@cedar-rapids.net">noj@cedar-rapids.net</a></p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/1999 10:49:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Southwood wrote:</p><p>&gt;         Be careful here--serialism is not a _style_ but rather a technique, or<br/>&gt; procedure/process for organizing music.

Take Elliot Carter<br/>who is not a serialist and has done some things I have liked in the past. I can<br/>think of few composers who scores are so easy to analyze as far as individual<br/>instruments having set interval &quot;personalities. Even knowing this I find it<br/>impossible to hear these structures when I am listening. If I like such a piece it<br/>is because of nothing to do with this structure! What happens a piece is successful<br/>despite the lack of success of the composers intention! I have never really resolved<br/>this one! What good is a Doomdays machine if you don&apos;t tell anyone about it. It is<br/>true that other cultures use variation techniques of high complexity. Tabla<br/>subdivisions come to mind and sometimes ,I hate to say it comes across as more<br/>acrobatic than musical. I have seen and know of of too many composers who put the<br/>notes down before they know the sound. In the case of Cage, I do believe though that<br/>he was quite aware of what &quot;chance&quot; is and what the sound would be.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
