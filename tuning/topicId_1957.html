I&apos;ve<br/>listened to many comparisons of synthesized just and<br/>equal tempered passages of music and also to quite a few<br/>side by side contrasting tuning versions of fairly simple<br/>pieces played on the piano.  These are performed fairly<br/>slowly and are in older more traditional styles.</p><p>&#x9;I&apos;ve listened to contrasting piano versions of pieces<br/>in JI, 1/4 comma mean tone temperament, 1/6 comma mean tone<br/>temperament, and equal temperament.  I generally get a<br/>subjective impression on listening to side by side<br/>comparisons of the just version or the closer&#xFFFD;to&#xFFFD;just<br/>1/4 comma MT version and the EQT version that the just<br/>or in many cases also the 1/4 MT version sounds like the<br/>&quot;real thing&quot; while the EQT version seems in comparison<br/>to be somehow &quot;attenuated&quot; or heard through some kind of<br/>filter.  From the point of view of the emotional impression<br/>made by the simultaneously sounding tones (as separated from<br/>the quality of the performance, the rhythmic vitality, etc.),<br/>The just or nearly just harmonies seem to make a more<br/>powerful impression and bring more positive emotion than<br/>do the equal tempered harmonies.</p><p>&#x9;To me, the difference seems to be somewhat analogous to<br/>the difference between listening to a recorded performance<br/>and being at a live performance - but that is only an<br/>analogy.  Both a just tuned and an equal tempered piano<br/>produce real sounds, of course.</p><p>&#x9;I can think of one possible &quot;evolutionary&quot; thing which<br/>might underlie JI&apos;s tending to give an impression of<br/>genuineness in contrast with impressions given by<br/>performances of multipart music which departs appreciably<br/>from just.  Birds and mammals among other animals, including<br/>ourselves, have as the most basic form of sound communication<br/>with one another calls made by voice, from bird songs to<br/>the mooing of cows, barks and howls of dogs, to human cries,<br/>shouts, and speech.  Acoustically, these are sounds made by<br/>horns and if I am not mistaken, their partials are aligned<br/>harmonically.  The sound of the voice of another person or<br/>of another animal has a special emotive quality - warmth -<br/>somehow a personal touch - which many of the other sounds of<br/>nature, although pleasing and admirable - wind whistling in<br/>trees, ocean waves crashing, objects falling to the ground,<br/>etc., do not possess.</p><p>&#x9;It seems to me not implausible to believe that the sounds<br/>of just or nearly just harmonies performed by a choir or by<br/>a carefully performing instrumental ensemble, although such<br/>music never was heard before humans had evolved and probably was<br/>heard rarely if at all more than several thousand years ago,<br/>have, by virtue of their tones lining up nearly harmonically,<br/>a special emotional intensity of appeal for many listeners<br/>which somehow hooks into brain systems involved with emotional<br/>response to the human voice.</p><p>&#x9;Before and even well into the era of equal temperament,<br/>many writers on music, including Handel, spoke of the<br/>departures from just introduced by tempering as departures<br/>from &quot;the truth.&quot;  While in an intellectual sense, a musical<br/>performance cannot be judged literally as telling the truth<br/>or not telling the truth, it is possible that for many of us<br/>a just or nearly just performance of much of the music with<br/>which we are familiar will indeed give an emotional impression<br/>of greater truthfulness or sincerity than a highly tempered<br/>version of that music.</p><p>&#x9;My impression is that a piano sixth comma mean tone<br/>performance has a slightly impressionistic vagueness similar<br/>to that of equal temperament, but generally it conveys (to me)<br/>a greater sense of warmth and musicality.  In contrast with<br/>this, a quarter comma MT version of the piece seems to have<br/>almost a crystal clarity of harmony and, for slowly played<br/>triadic harmonies, greater warmth and emotional intensity.<br/>In some cases, a just version of the piece will seem about the<br/>same as the 1/4 comma MT version as regards warmth, sometimes<br/>it will seem less warm, and sometimes a JI version will sound<br/>more &quot;absolutely truthful and straightforward&quot; than a 1/4 comma<br/>MT version.  The effects will be different depending on the<br/>harmonies.  Where a major whole tone is called for, to me it<br/>will often sound much better in JI than in 1/4 comma MT.</p><p>&#x9;But if some equal tempered music is associated in someone&apos;s<br/>mind with fond, deeply rooted memories while other tuning<br/>versions of the music &quot;just don&apos;t quite sound right&quot;, this<br/>will be a big factor in the kind of impression a musical<br/>performance will make.</p><p>&#x9;I did test the reactions of several hundred teen age and<br/>college entrant students to contrasting equal tempered and<br/>quarter comma mean tone versions of some piano pieces.  The<br/>reactions varied all over the place from those who vehemently<br/>disliked the sound of mean tone music to those who really<br/>liked it - in the words of one music school entrant &quot;I appreciate<br/>the sound of mean tone tuning.  It&apos;s just different enough to<br/>be almost exotic.  I think it&apos;s just beautiful.&quot;  Very<br/>roughly, perhaps 45 percent preferred the equal tempered<br/>versions on first hearing, 35 percent preferred the mean tone<br/>versions, and 20 percent didn&apos;t show a strong preference.</p><p>&#x9;Dave Hill   La Mesa, CA</p></div>
