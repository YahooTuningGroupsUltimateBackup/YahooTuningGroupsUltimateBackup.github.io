Is it a scale because the notes sound like they&apos;re jumping around a bit? And why 34TET? The numbers do not have the many advantages of 36 like being divisible by 2,3,4,6,9 etc, while the &quot;phi&quot; range doesn&apos;t seem very close at all. Why not try taking some of your more successful note-limited scales, see if they fit into 36 or near enough and imply a pattern, and go on from there?</p><p>ONTH, I quite liked the two pieces 12th root of PHI and Silver2 which are starting to resemble actual musical compositions. You know if you want to divide PHI up into equal symmetries besides 5 which is already in 36TET, you can always multiply the denominator 36 in the index by the desired number: third division 2^(25/(3x36=108)) = 1.17404 etc. Of course these imply new TET&apos;s 108 etc...For the 12th root of PHI, the problem is that 12 X 36 = 432 is too small to be of much use. Obviously you chose notes out of this set of 12 intervals for your composition with larger intervals.</p><p>-Rick</p></div>
