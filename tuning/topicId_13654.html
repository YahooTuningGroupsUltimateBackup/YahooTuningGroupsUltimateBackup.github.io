Accurate tuning to 2:1 thus is<br/>merely a matter of making the beats as slow as possible, i.e., by<br/>adjusting either of the two frequencies<br/>appropriately. However, that kind of &quot;octave adjustment&quot; is in no<br/>respect dependent on the perception of pitch;<br/>little or nothing can be learned from it about the pitch interval<br/>that corresponds to octave-equivalent tones. With<br/>respect to music it is most interesting to know precisely the width<br/>of the pitch interval pertinent to auditory<br/>octave equivalence.</p><p>Hmmm.  I&apos;m kinda wondering if this &quot;stretch&quot; perception really means<br/>much of anything...  Wasn&apos;t it Alexander Ellis who said that the only<br/>POSSIBLE way to tune a piano accurately was by the &quot;beating&quot;<br/>method... not by any other kind of &quot;auditory&quot; experience??</p><p>My experience, recently, in trying to tune my piano again was<br/>similar. If it weren&apos;t for BEATS... I wouldn&apos;t be anyplace.  No<br/>accuracy... nothing to go on.  In fact, I tried to use the Korg MT<br/>1200 (I think that&apos;t the number... the xenharmonic one... Johnny<br/>Reinhard has it right now) and it was a dismal failure, as far as<br/>piano tuning was concerned.</p><p>I could hardly MATCH the tones, the timbres were so different!  I can<br/>see why piano tuners used the &quot;beating&quot; method for so many years...</p><p>Frankly, being on this tuning list has made me much more INSECURE of<br/>my own tuning perception!  EVERYTHING now seems out of tune.  This<br/>would be a problem, except for the fact that I love such unsettling<br/>angst.  Seriously, though, the REFINEMENT of pitch perception seems<br/>to lead to MORE UNCERTAINTY and perceptual questioning...</p><p>Isn&apos;t &quot;beating&quot; the only &quot;real&quot; perceptual straw we have to grab on???<br/>____________ ____ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=13665 href="#13665">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2000 9:40:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; My experience, recently, in trying to tune my piano again was<br/>&gt; similar.
