I see 6 consonant tetrads here<br/>&gt;(you didn&apos;t even show one of them). That&apos;s pretty impressive! I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;think that can be beat. Why not use 72-tET and reduce the maximum error<br/>&gt;from almost 8 cents to under 3 cents?</p><p>Yes. There are 6 tetrads plus 4 triads. I&apos;m pretty sure it can&apos;t be beat (pun intended) too. I did some serious searching by considering the 225/128 (~= 7/4) as a bridge on a 5-limit lattice (easier to think and draw in 2D).

It also contains a diatonic scale.</p><p>I agree with Paul that one should distribute the septimal kleisma over the intervals involved. But forcing the scale to be a mode of such a large ET (72) seems of minor value (although it is only 1c worse than optimum). Minimum errors are obtained when the 7:4&apos;s and 5:3&apos;s are just. In this case all the other 7-limit intervals have only a quarter kleisma (1.93 cent) error. Wow! Do you agree that this seriously blurrs the distinction between JI and temperaments?</p><p>Note that there are 4 wolves in three different sizes. D-A is a comma-narrow wolf (-21.5c). If this were optimally tempered as well (to give two more triads), we&apos;d be in 1/4-comma meantone, the max error would go up to 5.4 cents, and I&apos;ve just described the 7-limit 12-of-meantone scale with which I joined this list last October. :-)</p><p>Carl&apos;s scale (with kleisma distributed) has 3 step sizes (as does my &quot;strange&quot; 9-limit temperament) of approximately 69, 84 and 116 cents.</p><p>The next best 12-tone scale I could find, having no comma steps (&quot;reasonable as a scale&quot;), also has 6 tetrads. But it only has 2 additional triads (not 4). It has 5 wolves (not 4) and no diatonic scale.
