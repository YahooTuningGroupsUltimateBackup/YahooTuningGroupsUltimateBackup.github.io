To judge by<br/>the amount of time Indian musicians spend tuning up their<br/>instruments, one wonders if they develop exceedingly<br/>fine sensitivity. I wonder how common it is for an Indian<br/>musician to be able to discriminate to within less than a cent.</p><p>I seem to remember Haresh saying something about two cents<br/>discrimination in pitch, but can&apos;t remember it clearly.</p><p>It is possible, and rather easy, to test if one is able to hear<br/>the pitch of notes in melodic context to within a single cent.</p><p>I do this in FTS. Can just play two notes at random,<br/>differing in pitch in a single cent, and see if one can distinguish<br/>them (random chord quiz can be used for that) or can play an ascending<br/>scale in 1200-tet as<br/>0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 (cents)<br/>then as<br/>0 1 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 3, ...<br/>and see if one can tell which is which, again using random chord quiz<br/>button to select.</p><p>If one can tell which is which, then it is reasonable to say that<br/>one can distinguish to within a single cent. If not, then one tries<br/>0 0 0 2 2 2 4 4 4,<br/>0 2 0 2 4 2 4 6 4,<br/>etc.</p><p>These things certainly vary; some non-musicians apparently can&apos;t distinguish<br/>in pitch even between notes a semitone apart. Some can tell them apart but<br/>don&apos;t know which is sharp and which is flat of the two, while a few think<br/>both notes sound identical in pitch.</p><p>I think one can make much finer discriminations in context of a piece<br/>of music, when simultaneous notes are played, and not just by counting beats<br/>- if one note in a chord is a cent sharp, I think one might be able<br/>to detect that, given two midi clips, one with it sharp and one without.<br/>(but haven&apos;t done proper tests of this, just anecdotal - once hearing<br/>two of John&apos;s midi clips, noticed in one of them a particular note that I<br/>was especially interested in was a bit sharper than it was in the other,<br/>and was curious enough to look at a midi clip hex dump, found it was about<br/>half a cent sharp. There&apos;s one in two chances of getting it right, so<br/>not very good as evidence! But I did think I could hear it, and found<br/>that I&apos;d got it right, so that&apos;s something).</p><p>Are you able to play to within nearest cent when no-one else is playing,<br/>or only when accompanied?</p><p>I&apos;m sure one can learn to improve ones pitch discrimination, just as<br/>astronomers can learn to see details in a telescope image of a galaxy,<br/>or of Jupiter, or whatever. Doesn&apos;t mean their eyes collect more light,<br/>or that their retina is more sensitive to light, just more used to<br/>intepreting what one sees in conditions where there is little light<br/>(in case of a galaxy) or (in case of planet) little in the way of contrast.</p><p>So a one cent discrimination doesn&apos;t seem too hard to accept to me.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there will be a fuzzy cut off point though, there always is.<br/>Maybe 0.1 cents yields random scores for everyone, or 0.01 cents,<br/>or whatever.</p><p>Anyone who has FTS can use the random chord quiz to test their pitch<br/>discrimination, and I could explain how it is done if it isn&apos;t clear.</p><p>Or, would be possible to do a zip of midi clips, randomly chosen,<br/>and then one has to try to tell which is which, and provide the correct<br/>answers either at another date (say, a week later), or at another<br/>url, so long as it isn&apos;t in the same zip (too easy to &quot;peek&quot;,<br/>and it is hard to resist looking at the answers when in the middle<br/>of a test).</p><p>Might be fun to do if people want to give it a go.</p><p>N.B. my own pitch discrimination by this test seems to be 5-6 cents<br/>for unambiguous discrimination, perhaps better, e.g. 4 cents, if<br/>alert. I used to think it was far better than that, but the tests<br/>don&apos;t bear it out.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=24605 href="#24605">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2001 9:09:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hmmm. are you hinting about starting a new tuning list?:)</p><p><a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Faith-Based Tuning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=24607 href="#24607">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>6/8/2001 9:34:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>KG,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hmmm. are you hinting about starting a new tuning list?:)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JSZANTO@A... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Faith-Based Tuning.</p><p>Yeah, it&apos;s the Evil-Twin list diametrically across from:</p><p><a href="/spiritual_tuning/">/spiritual_tuning/</a></p><p>You can see Rev.

Does it need to be multiple performances of the same work,<br/>or would it be significant to do longer songs measuring all the way through.</p><p>       Or perhaps several songs measuring the average accuracy compared to<br/>the notated score? I dont think it will be possible to get hundreds of<br/>recordings of the same work if nothng else for practical reasons, but it<br/>might be possible to get many recordings and scores of different songs that<br/>fit certain criteria dont ya think? How many works, or minutes, or notes, or<br/>what have you, do you think would be necessary to analyze in order to come<br/>out with evidence that is statistically significant?</p><p>This post was great because it discussed really making models of this sort of<br/>thing. I would love to discuss this more.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=24652 href="#24652">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2001 1:37:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Johnny</p><p>I&apos;ve just been doing a bit of practice, bearing what you said in mind,<br/>and a thought has occurred to me:</p><p>It would be quite possible for a player to play to greater accuracy<br/>than he or she can actually hear!</p><p>Consider a contrived example - a monochord with a very long string.<br/>Then one could just divide it up visually into smaller pitch intervals<br/>than one can hear.</p><p>For voice / wind instrument, seems one could learn the change in<br/>breath pressure corresponding to an increase in pitch by one<br/>cent.

If one was going to try and hear very small intervals it would be best<br/>to use a computer. A monochord wth a long string would be tough. Measurements<br/>would have to be EXACT. Even then if you think your measurements are exact<br/>you still wouldn&apos;t hear it and couldn&apos;t really be sure. With a computer if<br/>its programmed correctly at least you would know its playing what you want<br/>exactly even though you dont hear it. (or at least as accurately as the<br/>computer system allows)</p><p>With any live instruments though before doing something like that an<br/>exploration should occur of the possible accuracy of an instrument, whatever<br/>it is. It doesn&apos;t seem fair to say that many wind instruments, although<br/>maybe, can even play intervals 1 cent wide only, let alone less, and let<br/>alone accurately.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=24661 href="#24661">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/9/2001 2:52:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/9/01 5:04:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a href="mailto:JoJoBuBu@aol.com">JoJoBuBu@aol.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; .

If they dont or perhaps cant, and its not tested with a reliable source<br/>of testing, aka, a computer or some other scientifically accurate method,<br/>then your guess, and I do mean guess, by ear that you are landing on the<br/>386th cent may or may not be accurate. Secondly I did not suggest 6 cents as<br/>you keep saying, nor did I say anything about 5/4 being acceptable to any<br/>reasonable amout of error(six cents or otherwise). Nor did I define what it<br/>would mean for an interval to be acceptable, which that statement would<br/>require - do you mean a 5/4 with no beat frequency?. I also didn&apos;t say a<br/>pitch can be or can not be conceptualized in cents. I am disputing accuracy<br/>of pitch here not the conceptual idea of using cents to think about tones if<br/>thats what you are trying to get at.</p><p>Why couldn&apos;t a player hit to exactly the right cent when bending, sliding, or<br/>what not? Well all sorts of reasons could be, and if anyone else has any<br/>evidence on this please say so, but the width of the finger on string<br/>instruments, the way the lips are, the smallest amount you can move the<br/>tremolo bar on an electric guitar, what kind of guitar it is, or other<br/>simple mechanical reasons. Dont assume that just because you can<br/>conceptualize the idea of an infinite contiuum of pitch, the idea of pitch<br/>not the physical reality of it, that you can also hear  pitches or play<br/>pitches up to whatever arbitrary amount, in this case a cent, that you seem<br/>to think you or other players are able to do.</p><p>&gt;Why couldn&apos;t I, or any<br/>&gt;other player that can slide, slide up to and only up to a particular pitch,<br/>&gt;conceptualizeable in cents a priori?</p><p>a pri&middot;o&middot;ri (&auml; pr-&ocirc;r, -r, pr-&ocirc;r, -r)<br/>adj.<br/>Proceeding from a known or assumed cause to a necessarily related effect;<br/>deductive.</p><p>Derived by or designating the process of reasoning without reference to<br/>particular facts or experience.</p><p>Knowable without appeal to particular experience.<br/>Made before or without examination; not supported by factual study.</p><p>Good choice of words with a priori.
