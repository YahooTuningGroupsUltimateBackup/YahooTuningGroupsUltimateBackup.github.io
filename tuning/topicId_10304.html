Actually, the Scala file ji_19a.scl<br/>which is a 7-limit 19-tone scale is so similar to the &quot;bad Wilson&quot; that<br/>I don&apos;t need the scale any more.  Otherwise, you are right, I would have<br/>kept it, regardless of my &quot;paper training.&quot;</p><p>_____________ ________ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
