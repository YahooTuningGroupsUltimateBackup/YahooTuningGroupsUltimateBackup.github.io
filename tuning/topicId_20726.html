It is &quot;Six Degrees<br/>Of Tonality&quot;, and offers a sampler/primer on six temperaments published<br/>between the 1500&apos;s and the late, late, 20th century.<br/>   We have Scarlatti on a 1/4 C meantone, a Mozart piece on three different<br/>tunings (MT,WT, and ET) for a direct comparison,  Haydn on a Kirnberger III,<br/>Beethoven on a Young, Chopin on a DeMorgan, (which is a whole different<br/>kettle of tonic), and Grieg on a contemporary temperament modelled on a<br/>spreadsheet with Werckmeister&apos;s rules.<br/>   All these pieces are performed on a Steinway D.  We worked backwards, so<br/>that the tunings would  settle in on the piano as we left ET. Finally ending<br/>with a meantone, we wrapped it up and I then restrung the piano. (meantone is<br/>hard on old strings, a lotta movement to get down to G#, etc.).<br/> I will post the liner notes to the list later under their own heading so<br/>those that ain&apos;t in the mood for mossy old music can skip over it.   CD&apos;s can<br/>be ordered from me now at my address(below) or from Borders later.  Cost is<br/>$17 inclusive and overseas please add $2.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>1506 Cedar Lane<br/>Nashville, Tn. 37212</p></div>
