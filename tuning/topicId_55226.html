A unison vector is defined as a<br/>xenharmonic bridge of size small enough that it can be disregarded.<br/>However, if we temper 128/125 it is neither a xenharmonic bridge, nor<br/>is its size (41 cents) small enough to safely ignore. If &quot;um&quot; simply<br/>meant &quot;reduced kernel element&quot;, that is, something which is not 1 and<br/>not a power and which is tempered out by some temperament, I could use<br/>the word. An alternative possibility would be to require than an um is<br/>greater than one.</p><p>The definitions become more byzantine with &quot;bium&quot;, which isn&apos;t the<br/>wedge product of two ums, but the rank-two group they generate. I<br/>think this is heading towards serious confusion, particularly since he<br/>uses &quot;unison vector&quot; in the defintion, which contradicts the way<br/>&quot;unison vector&quot; is defined. Since &quot;bium&quot; is intended to describe a<br/>kernel (the example given is the kernel for &lt;12 19 28|) it seems to me<br/>we would be better off with a definition of the kernel of a temperament.</p><p>kernel</p><p>If T is a p-limit temperament, the set of all p-limit intervals which<br/>T maps to the unison (ie, which vanish in the temperament) is the<br/>kernel of T.

The rational numbers<br/>themselves, and their vector spaces, have different types of<br/>embeddings, but the most familiar and useful to us is into the real<br/>numbers and real vector spaces. These embeddings are natural and<br/>easily defined--we obviously have no problem thinking about integers<br/>as a kind of real number. However, my point is that automatically<br/>thinking in terms of the embedding does not always seem like a good idea.</p><p> It seems to<br/>&gt; me the embedding does not deny the abelian group properties and in some<br/>&gt; sense the objects we work with cross the categories regularly.</p><p>It&apos;s completely standard to do that sort of thing; my objection is<br/>that it is also standard to simply be able to forget about any<br/>embeddings. It&apos;s far from clear to me that people are doing this, or<br/>are ready to do it, if they insist on always thinking in terms of vectors.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand the ratios that form a given lattice also seem like an<br/>&gt; obvious choice, e.g. possibly 3/2 and 5/4 for the 5-limit.</p><p>There is no such thing as the ratios that form a given lattice in any<br/>unique sense; there is such a thing as a lattice basis, but it is not<br/>unique. So, indeed, you can define a lattice (assuming you have a norm<br/>or at least a topology) using 3/2 and 5/4, but you could also use 3/2<br/>and 6/5, or 6/5 and 5/4, etc.</p></div><h3><a id=55553 href="#55553">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2004 2:34:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;There is no such thing as the ratios that form a given lattice in any<br/>&gt;unique sense; there is such a thing as a lattice basis, but it is not<br/>&gt;unique.
