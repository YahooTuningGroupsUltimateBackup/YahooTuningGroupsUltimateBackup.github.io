I had people listen to pairs of tones and rate how much they<br/>&quot;blended&quot; or something like that (I remember the wording was really<br/>hard to get right). It wasn&apos;t the most rigorous study in the world,<br/>but I ended up with a graph that looked pretty good and had separate<br/>peaks for, for example, 7/6 and 6/5.</p><p>The thing is that when people listen to 7-limit JI their sense of<br/>pitch and conditioning is telling them that it&apos;s out of tune, but<br/>their sense of aural quality is telling them that it&apos;s in tune because<br/>it blends together and doesn&apos;t beat. That&apos;s why it depends so much on<br/>the timbre.</p><p>Another experience, which I&apos;m not sure I should even mention, was with<br/>the unique drug diisopropyltryptamine. Wikipedia has a decent article<br/>on it. It&apos;s not exactly illegal, at least in the US, but I don&apos;t know<br/>where you can get a hold of it. Anyway, DIPT is a hallucinogen that<br/>affects only the sense of hearing. People&apos;s voices sound like frogs.<br/>It&apos;s so weird because you can play an interval that you know should be<br/>a perfect fifth, but it sounds like a sixth or seventh, even though<br/>the two notes blend together just like a fifth. Then you find two<br/>notes that you think sound like a fifth, and they clash horribly. It&apos;s<br/>very difficult to describe.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=63748 href="#63748">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2006 9:54:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Keenan.</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&gt; Another experience, which I&apos;m not sure I should even mention, was with<br/>&gt; the unique drug diisopropyltryptamine.

Someday this might become a<br/>standard psychological personality test.&quot;</p><p>Jonathan Glaser told me that, so apparently there is at least one<br/>other believer in this theory. One trouble I have with the &quot;mood&quot; of<br/>19 is that 19 used as a way to play common-practice music with a<br/>meantone basis does not seem to me to have the same &quot;mood&quot; as music<br/>composed natively in 19. 19, like other tuning systems, really has a<br/>range of moods.

However, I am<br/>&gt; interested in this kind of music in good measure because it *doesn&apos;t*<br/>&gt; sound out of tune to me.</p><p>This is all speculation from my part but maybe people refer to<br/>different things with &quot;out-of-tuneness&quot;!</p><p>Because microtonal musicians have studied at least some relevant<br/>psychoacoustics and listened to new and weird intervals with all this<br/>theoretical background in mind their judgement of out-of-tuneness is<br/>dominated by perceptions of roughness, sonance and other<br/>psychoacoustical factors.</p><p>Normal listeners are very likely able to hear these things (while<br/>probably not being aware of hearing them) but do not think those are<br/>the things to listen for when judging out-of-tuneness.</p><p>They might just be comparing the microtonal performance under<br/>judgement to paradigm performances of music where the same musical<br/>instruments are used.</p><p>This is context-sensitive. At least for me microtonal tunings sound<br/>more striking with traditional instruments than with entirely new<br/>sounds. It might be this strikingness that is understood as<br/>out-of-tuneness. Because of the negative connotations associated with<br/>the term &quot;out-of-tune&quot; this is perceived as something undesirable.</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=63767 href="#63767">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2006 4:01:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Another experience, which I&apos;m not sure I should even mention, was<br/>&gt; with the unique drug diisopropyltryptamine.

Music composed natively in 19-ET can take advantage of magic, hanson, negri, and sensi temperaments and their associated scales. Another difference is that leading tones can be made sharper in 19-ET (as Ivor Darreg points out in the article linked to), which is the same thing that I do with 26-ET, but conflicts with the traditional usage in meantone notation (G-Gb-G instead of G-F#-G). I think this is a very natural thing to do in 19-ET, and you can hear the difference between sharpened and unsharpened versions of the same note in a piece that I wrote in 19-ET many years ago (the first microtonal thing I ever wrote):</p><p>ftp://ftp.io.com/pub/usr/hmiller/music/cv1.mp3</p><p>The first appearance of the theme, around 0:06, uses the sharpened version of the supertonic, which propels the music forward.

The strange thing is that Carl speaks of<br/>something that reminds me of an &quot;exponential&quot; frequency alterations while<br/>Keenan&apos;s experience reminds me strikingly of the effect of linear frequency<br/>shifting (i.e. harmonic timbres are no longer harmonic and very rarely vice<br/>versa). Well, I&apos;m normally used to sing something around more or less 220Hz<br/>when someone says &quot;Sing an A3&quot; and noone knows if I heard it higher or lower<br/>if I had this experience (or is it definitely always lower?) and if I heard<br/>the same intervals only at different absolute pitches. If the intervals were<br/>really different, that would, of course, be a much more frightening<br/>experience.</p><p>I&apos;ve also heard of a strange event that happened to one of my former<br/>schoolmates. About four years ago, he had some sort of a seisure, he<br/>suddenly fell into coma, and when he woke up some hours later, he heard<br/>everything about 80 cents lower. The worse thing for him was that it took<br/>about four or five months for his hearing to recover. But he said that the<br/>intervals were still the same for him and he heard no overtone distortion.</p><p>Some years ago, I made CoolEdit scripts which work with amplitude modulation<br/>in various ways. Two of their effects are called &quot;100Hz up&quot; and &quot;100Hz<br/>down&quot;, respectively. It&apos;s some sort of a two-step process. First, a regular<br/>amplitude modulation is used which shifts the frequencies both up and down<br/>so that every single tone becomes two. Then, both the original signal and<br/>the modulator are phase-shifted by 90 degrees in the entire frequency range<br/>and the modulation is used for a second time. Finally, the two results of<br/>the modulation are either mixed or subtracted, depending on whether you wish<br/>to shift the frequencies down or up, respectively. As the names suggest,<br/>these effects shift the entire frequency band linearly up or down by 100Hz<br/>by default. You can specify any other frequency if you check the &quot;Pause at<br/>dialogs&quot; box before launching the script and then change the frequency to<br/>the desired one in both stages of the modulation. . If you were interested,<br/>I can find the script and send it to you. Well, maybe we&apos;ll find a way of<br/>&quot;digitally&quot; simulating DIPT in the end, who knows? :-D</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=63783 href="#63783">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 12:22:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;threesixesinarow&quot; &lt;CACCOLA@N...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m wondering if there is something funny about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the way most of us hear, which causes us to be able<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to listen to Harry Partch for the first time and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately think it sounds cool.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/darreg/CASE.HTM">http://sonic-arts.org/darreg/CASE.HTM</a> Ivor Darreg<br/>&gt; &gt; describes a kind of mood peculiar to 19 equal that<br/>&gt; &gt; makes sense to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found this quote interesting: &quot;Since then, I have<br/>&gt; interviewed about 200 persons and found that certain<br/>&gt; personality types prefer 19 and others prefer the<br/>&gt; 22-tone temperament, and it is difficult to be<br/>&gt; impartial about them, but I do my best.

Wikipedia has a decent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; article on it. It&apos;s not exactly illegal, at least in the US, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know where you can get a hold of it. Anyway, DIPT is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hallucinogen that affects only the sense of hearing. People&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; voices sound like frogs.  It&apos;s so weird because you can play an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interval that you know should be a perfect fifth, but it sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like a sixth or seventh, even though the two notes blend together<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just like a fifth. Then you find two notes that you think sound<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like a fifth, and they clash horribly. It&apos;s very difficult to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; describe.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve also taken DIPT, with a friend (who&apos;s a hearing researcher)<br/>&gt; &gt; watching (and testing) me.  Contrary to Shulgin&apos;s claims, my<br/>&gt; &gt; thinking process was definitely affected, but I was plenty able<br/>&gt; &gt; to confirm that I was experiencing absolute pitch shifts of about<br/>&gt; &gt; a whole tone (down, IIRC).  Part of how we recognize voices is by<br/>&gt; &gt; the *absolute* pitches of formants in them.  You can get a<br/>&gt; &gt; similar effect by recording your friend&apos;s voice and using a<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch-but-not-speed shifter on it in software.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aha, so, as far as I can understand this matter, the frequency band is<br/>never<br/>&gt; shifted upwards in this case. The strange thing is that Carl speaks of<br/>&gt; something that reminds me of an &quot;exponential&quot; frequency alterations while<br/>&gt; Keenan&apos;s experience reminds me strikingly of the effect of linear<br/>frequency<br/>&gt; shifting (i.e. harmonic timbres are no longer harmonic and very rarely<br/>vice<br/>&gt; versa). Well, I&apos;m normally used to sing something around more or less<br/>220Hz<br/>&gt; when someone says &quot;Sing an A3&quot; and noone knows if I heard it higher or<br/>lower<br/>&gt; if I had this experience (or is it definitely always lower?) and if I<br/>heard<br/>&gt; the same intervals only at different absolute pitches. If the intervals<br/>were<br/>&gt; really different, that would, of course, be a much more frightening<br/>&gt; experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve also heard of a strange event that happened to one of my former<br/>&gt; schoolmates. About four years ago, he had some sort of a seisure, he<br/>&gt; suddenly fell into coma, and when he woke up some hours later, he heard<br/>&gt; everything about 80 cents lower. The worse thing for him was that it took<br/>&gt; about four or five months for his hearing to recover. But he said that the<br/>&gt; intervals were still the same for him and he heard no overtone distortion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some years ago, I made CoolEdit scripts which work with amplitude<br/>modulation<br/>&gt; in various ways. Two of their effects are called &quot;100Hz up&quot; and &quot;100Hz<br/>&gt; down&quot;, respectively. It&apos;s some sort of a two-step process. First, a<br/>regular<br/>&gt; amplitude modulation is used which shifts the frequencies both up and down<br/>&gt; so that every single tone becomes two. Then, both the original signal and<br/>&gt; the modulator are phase-shifted by 90 degrees in the entire frequency<br/>range<br/>&gt; and the modulation is used for a second time. Finally, the two results of<br/>&gt; the modulation are either mixed or subtracted, depending on whether you<br/>wish<br/>&gt; to shift the frequencies down or up, respectively. As the names suggest,<br/>&gt; these effects shift the entire frequency band linearly up or down by 100Hz<br/>&gt; by default. You can specify any other frequency if you check the &quot;Pause at<br/>&gt; dialogs&quot; box before launching the script and then change the frequency to<br/>&gt; the desired one in both stages of the modulation. . If you were<br/>interested,<br/>&gt; I can find the script and send it to you. Well, maybe we&apos;ll find a way of<br/>&gt; &quot;digitally&quot; simulating DIPT in the end, who knows? :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=63785 href="#63785">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2006 5:00:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan.</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&gt; That would be the equivalent of sonic dipsomania?</p><p>Oh, what&apos;s sonic dipsomania?

What&apos;s really going on with the desciption of in-tune,<br/>&gt; reasonably tame 7-limit harmonies as &quot;extremely cacophonic&quot;, when in<br/>&gt; fact the the harsh features of what I might be inclinded to call<br/>&gt; &quot;cacophonic&quot; are not present? Why do people object to this sort of<br/>&gt; &quot;cacophonic&quot; when very noisy music is now a staple of both popular<br/>and<br/>&gt; classical traditions?

More than that -- the more you listen to new and weird intervals the less weird they become.  If you&apos;ve spent hours working on a piece in a tuning system you&apos;re already familiar with, it&apos;s hardly suprising that it will sound less out of tune to you than to a fresh listener.</p><p>&gt; Normal listeners are very likely able to hear these things (while<br/>&gt; probably not being aware of hearing them) but do not think those are<br/>&gt; the things to listen for when judging out-of-tuneness. &gt; &gt; They might just be comparing the microtonal performance under<br/>&gt; judgement to paradigm performances of music where the same musical<br/>&gt; instruments are used. Yes, I think this is completely true.  My experience of playing most of the music I like to most of my friends is that the instantly hate it. And the speed with which they hate it is truly alarming.  How can you make a definitive judgement on a style you&apos;ve never heard before in 20 seconds, while you&apos;re talking the whole time?  Nevertheless, they do it.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if the aim should be to copy existing styles -- to try and ensnare people who like those styles -- or be completely different so you aren&apos;t damned for getting it slightly wrong.

What I seem to have is an unusual desire to persist with unfamiliar music until is stops sounding like a racket.   Maybe that&apos;s something we share, and have to expect from our listeners.</p><p>&gt; This is context-sensitive. At least for me microtonal tunings sound<br/>&gt; more striking with traditional instruments than with entirely new<br/>&gt; sounds. It might be this strikingness that is understood as<br/>&gt; out-of-tuneness. Because of the negative connotations associated with<br/>&gt; the term &quot;out-of-tune&quot; this is perceived as something undesirable. How should we manipulate the context?  I&apos;ve always thought that microtonal pieces should start with an exposition of some kind, like tonal music establishes the key and Indian classical music establishes the raga.  But I still don&apos;t really know how to go about it.  Do you start with the characteristic chords of your system, or with more familiar chords and introduce the strange notes later?  The danger&apos;s that you either turn people off right at the start or they smell a rat when the strange intervals creep in.  I know some composers have been dazzled by the newness of microtonality and ended up spending too much time going up and down scales so that we can hear the newness of it all.</p><p>It&apos;d be super if I could learn from the experience of my betters but I really don&apos;t know how other people have approached this problem.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=63892 href="#63892">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2006 1:49:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham,</p><p>Great post, lots of personal insights into your musical soul (so to<br/>speak...)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; More than that -- the more you listen to new and weird intervals the<br/>&gt; less weird they become.

Solitary music making&apos;s an unusual, and maybe perverted activity.  Music&apos;s a part of a wide range of communal activities.  You can easily look at it as a tool for bringing people together.  If microtonality acts as a barrier between me and other people I know with an interest in music then it&apos;s a problem. It&apos;s a problem that goes to the heart of what music making should be about.</p><p>OTOH, as I&apos;ve changed jobs and homes so much in the past few years, the largely online microtonal community is the most enduring one in my life beyond my family.  So that&apos;s worth thinking about as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt;How should we manipulate the context?<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I don&apos;t look at it that way, nor do I view my writing as<br/>&gt; composing in some way to justify the use of microtones. I use them<br/>&gt; when they seem like the only way to express what I want to express.</p><p>I got interested in microtonality because I thought I could use it to make better music.  Because music&apos;s a subjective thing that means other people have to agree.  If microtonality&apos;s something that means people like my music less (i.e. it&apos;s worse in their subjectivity) then it&apos;s a waste of time.  If I thought I could make better music in 12-equal then I&apos;d do that.  It&apos;d be a lot less trouble.  Leave microtonlity as theory-only.  Or maybe produce microtonal music for my own pleasure and round everything off to 12 notes before I make it public.  I&apos;d much rather keep working on good microtonal music, so that it sounds better than anything I could have done otherwise.  That means I have to think about how people are actually going to hear it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;It&apos;d be super if I could learn from the experience of my betters but I &gt;&gt;really don&apos;t know how other people have approached this problem.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d say one would want to view music creation on a larger scale, and<br/>&gt; not simply &quot;how does everyone else make music out of microtones&quot;. If<br/>&gt; that is the only tack you take, it is probably going to sound just<br/>&gt; like the description, instead of an inevitable result of a creative act.</p><p>I&apos;m not interested in how people do it, but how they&apos;ve been successful in doing it.  How do you make explicitly microtonal music that a naive (but open minded) listener can understand on a first hearing?

But it&apos;s what Gene thought about his own music &gt;&gt;when he started the original thread.  It&apos;s something we should be &gt;&gt;thinking about.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not me. If it is material that interests me, that is what I choose to<br/>&gt; use. And I *do* stand by the idea that when microtonal music is well<br/>&gt; written, well performed and/or well recorded, it doesn&apos;t much matter<br/>&gt; that it isn&apos;t 12tet. But that is just my take on it.</p><p>If the material interests you, then yes, use it.  All I&apos;m saying is that you should try and make it platable.</p><p>I&apos;d say that if music&apos;s well it can stand up with a mediocre performance and a poor recording.  The kind of people who switch off are same ones who won&apos;t but up with out-of-tune-ness.  Still, that&apos;s a depressing rallying cry -- &quot;work hard at your microtonal music and maybe it can be as good as if the microtones weren&apos;t there!&quot;  I still hope there&apos;s good music that only stands up because it isn&apos;t in 12tet.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If it&apos;s a general phenomenon -- things we think are in &gt;&gt;tune sound out of tune to our listeners -- then surely we should think &gt;&gt;of ways to avoid it.  I&apos;m surprised there&apos;s even disagreement about<br/>&gt; &gt; that.<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t be surprised. It appears we have different reasons for<br/>&gt; writing/performing music. I don&apos;t mean that to sound elitist or<br/>&gt; dismissive of listeners; in fact, I have faith in the listeners!</p><p>Of course you can&apos;t be elitist, because elitism targets an audience as much as populism.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I want to make good music and I&apos;m happier the better I think it is.  It &gt;&gt;isn&apos;t always possible to tell by listening myself.  I know what it&apos;s &gt;&gt;supposed to be doing and what&apos;s going to happen next.  And I don&apos;t &gt;&gt;listen to finished pieces enough that my own pleasure makes up for the &gt;&gt;work involved in finishing them.<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, it seems like you need to spend more time in the crafting of<br/>&gt; your music, dote on it and nurture it, and spend less time on the<br/>&gt; other aspects.</p><p>Other aspects?  What other aspects?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Is this another tuning list myth?  Along with &quot;everybody except me is &gt;&gt;doing theory without practice&quot; we now have &quot;everybody except me is &gt;&gt;putting too much emphasis on the microtonality and not the music&quot;.  &gt; &gt; No, it isn&apos;t a myth, and I&apos;m not the only one that feels that way.<br/>&gt; This isn&apos;t about &quot;me&quot;.</p><p>People feeling that way is what makes it a myth.  But if everybody agrees with it it can&apos;t be contradicting the mainstream of the list.</p><p>&gt;&gt;How do you get from what I said to how you paraphrase it?<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m thinking out loud. It would be a lot easier if we were simply<br/>&gt; sitting in a pub, so if I stray or get fuzzy on your concepts through<br/>&gt; a paraphrase, please forgive me. I&apos;m simply, by thinking out loud,<br/>&gt; trying to find some alternatives for you/with you.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;d be easier, only faster.  I don&apos;t mind at all.  That&apos;s the point of conversation.  Now, it would be easier if we had musical instruments of some sort to hand, so we could talk about music without it being in the abstract.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Incidentally, &quot;tiny notes&quot; aren&apos;t what I&apos;m doing (or not doing) now.<br/>&gt; &gt; Ahem, again, just a figure of speech. I get tired of typing<br/>&gt; &quot;microtones&quot; all the time! :)</p><p>Which is still inaccurate but that&apos;s the language we have to work with.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t know, it&apos;s difficult to find my way around.<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t buy that, you&apos;re smart. I&apos;m just saying poke your head in<br/>&gt; there every so often. I&apos;m trying to find a place for you to see some<br/>&gt; thought processes that are more in the realm of composing or &quot;making<br/>&gt; music&quot; rather than keeping your focus in these (tuning) lists, as it<br/>&gt; can become claustrophobic, and be only one way of looking at making music.</p><p>The tuning lists have a big variety of ways of looking at music, which results from them not being based around a particular style.  Anyway, that site took a while to load and I couldn&apos;t find my away around.  I ended up on Kyle Gann&apos;s blog which seems to be a different site altogether.  And I found this article:</p><p><a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2005/12/the_underrated_predictability.html">http://www.artsjournal.com/postclassic/2005/12/the_underrated_predictability.html</a></p><p>which says much what I was trying to say but more eloquently.  People even agree with it!</p><p>&gt;&gt;And the &gt;&gt;&quot;contemporary classical&quot; tag scares me.  Maybe when I have a permanent &gt;&gt;connection and time on my hands.<br/>&gt; &gt; Who cares what they call it? There are composers there that come from<br/>&gt; a lot of different backgrounds. Anyway, it is just one place, I&apos;m sure<br/>&gt; there are others. I just think you need more perspective on music<br/>&gt; creation then we get simply on the tuning fora.</p><p>We&apos;ll see, time to sign off now and I haven&apos;t reloaded it:P</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=63953 href="#63953">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2006 3:55:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt; I would only like to add that Lou Harrison got me into using pentatonics again. they are easy to teach other players and if you look at it a just pentatonic ( like others of unequal sizes taken from larger equal sets as to not include what might be your own preference or not) they often contain more different size intervals than one can get out of the entire 12 tone scale. i find them quite challenging to pull something out of them that hasn&apos;t been done.</p><p>I&apos;m looking at variations of</p><p>1/1 8/7 21/16 3/2 7/4 2/1</p><p>tempered so that it has four intervals like 8:7, all the same.

Before amplification it was part of the form of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; music making that involved the most musicians.  Composers putting dots<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on paper for their own solitary pleasure have always been rarer than<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; coprophiles.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Nonsense. Making music for oneself is a perfectly legitimate activity.<br/>&gt; &gt;And there are often situations, personal, cultural-political,<br/>&gt; &gt;economic, etc., where the making of public music is so limited or<br/>&gt; &gt;controlled that private music-making is the only avenue available for<br/>&gt; &gt;one&apos;s conscious.  The later Ives and Nancarrow composed to satisfy<br/>&gt; &gt;their own imaginations, for their own ears, and their own cabinet<br/>&gt; &gt;drawers, and I don&apos;t think the production of either was anything but<br/>&gt; &gt;musical. Of course, there is some satisfaction, some sense of<br/>&gt; &gt;resolution to hearing these pieces finally in public, but that sense<br/>&gt; &gt;of resolution is our satisfaction as listeners, not the composers in<br/>&gt; &gt;question. That would be projection on our part, and projection onto<br/>&gt; &gt;ghosts. I think that they were satified with their music and do not<br/>&gt; &gt;need our projection.  Could you imagine what a work _Le Nozze de<br/>&gt; &gt;Figaro_ would have been if Mozart had not had to submit to the royal<br/>&gt; &gt;censors?  How about works of Prokofiev or Schostakovich? Better to<br/>&gt; &gt;damn politics and fashion and make the music you want to hear, not the<br/>&gt; &gt;music they want others to hear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;A good friend of mine, and a superb composer of works in just<br/>&gt; &gt;intonation and in historical temperaments, is older and in poor<br/>&gt; &gt;health. His work has always required intense musical preparation, is<br/>&gt; &gt;subtle, and will never find a wide public. He can no longer get to his<br/>&gt; &gt;manuscripts himself, physically, but has insured that a University<br/>&gt; &gt;library will handle the archives. He doesn&apos;t have the energy now to<br/>&gt; &gt;promote his work in any way, but has a number of projects that he<br/>&gt; &gt;wishes to finish. So he concentrates the energy that he has on those<br/>&gt; &gt;projects. He is literally making all the music that he can, and I<br/>&gt; &gt;cannot fault him for this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ve recently had the luxury of having only a bit of work for hire on<br/>&gt; &gt;my desk and that has coincided with a slight crisis about my own<br/>&gt; &gt;regressive infantiloquy (not getting any younger, any of us). So I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt;decided to do two things -- (1) make a lot of pieces that do things<br/>&gt; &gt;that I&apos;ve always wanted to hear, and (2) not worry about finishing any<br/>&gt; &gt;of them. As far as I&apos;m concerned, I&apos;m making more music than ever, and<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ve never been a happier camper.  By your terms, I&apos;m not making music<br/>&gt; &gt;at all. By the terms of a lot of people on this planet, you&apos;re right.<br/>&gt; &gt;And I do worry about this, and honestly, I do calculate a bit that a<br/>&gt; &gt;lot of this music is going to eventually get used in some public way.<br/>&gt; &gt;But so what? To paraphrase the old joke that Beckett paraphrase in<br/>&gt; &gt;_Endgame_: I look at the world, then listen to my music, and figure<br/>&gt; &gt;out pretty quickly that I&apos;m on the right track after all.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;DJW</p></div><h3><a id=63975 href="#63975">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2006 6:43:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>One more thing I want to add to my post for Chris.</p><p>It&apos;s a well-known matter that musicians, if this term can serve, are<br/>significantly more sensitive to the harmonic content of music than<br/>non-musicians are. Speaking for myself, as time goes, I&apos;m getting a feeling<br/>like if this was an extreme of a proven truth in my case. There are pieces<br/>whose harmonic progressions seem hollow to me and give me a feeling like<br/>&quot;better to go away from that&quot;. And there are others whose harmonies sound so<br/>nice and clear and beautiful to me that it almost makes me cry -- sorry for<br/>some of you who may find my harmonic sensing too emotional. This is one of<br/>the other reasons why I also prefer negative linear temperaments (i.e.<br/>meantones) instead of the positive ones when playing regular tonal music. Of<br/>course, if I had some equipment like Groven had, maybe I&apos;d go for schismic<br/>tempering. Nevertheless, the idea that I&apos;m playing &quot;C-Fb-G&quot; to get C major<br/>or &quot;C-D#-G&quot; to get C minor does not satisfy me very well. So I decided to<br/>think of harmonies in the meantone-like point of view and nowadays, if<br/>someone plays or sings a tone and asks me to tell its name, I&apos;ll say &quot;Db&quot; if<br/>it&apos;s a bit higher or &quot;C#&quot; if it&apos;s a bit lower. And if you ask me what I<br/>think about 7/4, well, I take it as an augmented 6th.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=63978 href="#63978">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2006 6:48:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt; Morning, Graham -</p><p>Afternoon!</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d say that if music&apos;s well it can stand up with a mediocre<br/>&gt; performance &gt;&gt;and a poor recording.<br/>&gt; &gt; That is probably true, but unless you are banking on the fact that<br/>&gt; each and every one is going to be a complete gem, content-wise, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t hurt to put effort into the performance (and recording, if not<br/>&gt; live).</p><p>Ah, now this is where I disagree with you.  If you&apos;re producing gems it&apos;s worth getting good performances and recordings of them.  Maybe the composer isn&apos;t the best person to do that, though.  But if the notes-ordered-in-time part of the music isn&apos;t so good you&apos;re better off moving on to the next piece and trying to do improve.  To extend your metaphor, it&apos;s better to try and produce a gem than to keep on polishing turds.  When you succeed you can always hope that a good performer will recognize it from your own mediocre recording and take it up.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t describe the way I work, but then it isn&apos;t really about me.   If somebody&apos;s mainly interested in the melody, harmony and rhythm then I&apos;d encourage them to stick with quantized performances on General MIDI synths.  The rest of it can swallow up far too much of your time.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Still, that&apos;s a depressing &gt;&gt;rallying cry -- &quot;work hard at your microtonal music and maybe it can be &gt;&gt;as good as if the microtones weren&apos;t there!&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t mean to give that impression, I&apos;m only saying that the<br/>&gt; crafting/creating of a good piece of music entails elements besides or<br/>&gt; beyond the tuning, and if your audience that is continually dismissing<br/>&gt; your microtonal work has some very recognizable touchstones in the<br/>&gt; linigua franca of 12tet, one wonders what would happen if - at least<br/>&gt; for the moment, if only to experiment - you could try seeing if they<br/>&gt; liked something you did in 12. It may be a cold splash of water, but<br/>&gt; if you don&apos;t reach them that way them maybe, just maybe, it is more<br/>&gt; than the non-12-ness that is bothering them.</p><p>Well, yes, of course there&apos;s more to it than the tuning.  How is it even worth your time to type out such an obvious observation?</p><p>And no, I don&apos;t think it is only the microtonality.  Unlike Gene I&apos;ve never had complaints about being out of tune.  But I do find people hear things as weirder than I do and maybe the tuning&apos;s part of that.  The particularly uncultured lot I used to work with didn&apos;t like the unequal rhythms in Stellar Floor Text at all although they weren&apos;t smart enough to know why.  And you didn&apos;t like the drums in the magic demo.  So keeping to simple rhythms would be a better place to start.</p><p>You know, I listened back to that magic demo to see what I still think about it.  Much to my disappointment, the first 30 seconds or so was awful!  Incoherent drums, too much bass, generally poor sound quality, and no strong ideas.  But then it started to improve.  By the end it was really quite good.  So I listened to it again, and of course it&apos;s like that all they way through, and I like it all the way through again. Some cool 9-limit chords as well.  But it supports my idea that I need to hold the listener&apos;s hand for that first 30 seconds.</p><p>Oh, and while I&apos;m at it, the description on my website says &quot;Demonstration of magic temperament.  Did actually take quite a bit of work.&quot;  I hope you take that as typical British irony, and don&apos;t think I only recorded it to demonstrate magic temperament :-O</p><p>&gt;&gt;I still hope there&apos;s good &gt;&gt;music that only stands up because it isn&apos;t in 12tet.<br/>&gt; &gt; I suppose, but I prefer things that a good because of what they *are*,<br/>&gt;  as opposed to what they *are not*.</p><p>Ah, well, you&apos;re the one who introduced the negative.  I can feel an analogy coming on.  Do you think heavy rock is good because it doesn&apos;t use acoustic guitars?  I think it&apos;s proved that amplification needn&apos;t be a barrier to audience approval, but can even be a positive thing. Really, microtonality should be the same.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, it seems like you need to spend more time in the crafting of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;your music, dote on it and nurture it, and spend less time on the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;other aspects.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Other aspects?  What other aspects?<br/>&gt; &gt; Tuning for tuning&apos;s sake. I guess I&apos;m saying that the desire to make<br/>&gt; compelling music is strong, but it takes a lot of time and work to<br/>&gt; bring it off; one must make that a priority. I don&apos;t *know* that you<br/>&gt; spend more time on tuning issues than you do on creating music with<br/>&gt; those tunings, but if you want your musical creations to have better<br/>&gt; effect, maybe you need to spend more time in that arena. As I say, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; just conjecturing.</p><p>How much time do you think the tuning, actually tied to the music, actually takes?  Or how little time do you think I get the rest of it done in?  Most of the time is spent moving notes around, and most of that&apos;s in the accompaniment because it&apos;s where most of the notes are.  I could save most of the effort by using loops, which I have done to an extent in the past.  Tuning doesn&apos;t really enter into it.  Even the custom timbres I&apos;m using now weren&apos;t such a problem.</p><p>&gt;&gt;People feeling that way is what makes it a myth.  But if everybody &gt;&gt;agrees with it it can&apos;t be contradicting the mainstream of the list.<br/>&gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t say everyone. The list just has it&apos;s &apos;schools of thought&apos;.</p><p>Yes, the list&apos;s diverse, as it should be.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll stick with non12, will that work?</p><p>Oh, there&apos;s nothing wrong with &quot;microtonality&quot;.  It&apos;s what everybody else says.  I was only remarking that it isn&apos;t always accurate.  But our language would be an impoverished thing if we only used words in line with their strict etymology.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=63979 href="#63979">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2006 6:49:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;  i was making the assumption that you thought of composers of just solitary animals. glad we are not disagreeing with you on this</p><p>Indeed, I was saying that music making of all kinds is usually a social activity.</p><p>&gt; well i would say that many amateurs are quite gifted and this was a resource that i think Cardew tried to bring back into the music making community.

Chamber music started with amateurs and a lot of great music has been written for them.  I don&apos;t know about Cardew, I wasn&apos;t there, but I&apos;d say Johnny Rotten did a lot more to bring music making to ordinary people.  Especially the ones turned off by music lessons.</p><p>&gt;  electronics has the great advantage of allowing individuals to work directly with the sound as opposed to an ideal rendition of it.<br/>&gt;  It does make certain music possible and subtleties not possible otherwise.</p><p>That means you spend lots and lots of time putting sound together instead of lots and lots of time learning an instrument.  It doesn&apos;t represent the way most electronic music&apos;s made or how I expect the best electronic music to be made in the future.  Usually you work with an engineer&apos;s abstraction rather than sound itself.  It&apos;s much easier to get work done that way.</p><p>&gt;  My own personal objection is the interface between human and machine still falls short for me. but that is just me.</p><p>Have you played with a 303 box?  It&apos;s a great way to make simple music without actually playing notes.  I think you can get an RB338 as a free download now.

For the next ten years or so I<br/>will be working on a 53-eq oratorio, setting some<br/>twenty sacred poems from around the world to music. I<br/>will be choosing ancient scales that may have been<br/>heard by these poets, and I&apos;ve chosen to start with<br/>scales that sound very much like 12-eq (our<br/>traditional major scale in pure Pythagorean tuning is<br/>almost indistinguishable from 12-eq to a casual<br/>listener, as long as you avoid the comma). Gradually I<br/>will go into scales that take the ear further and<br/>further from what it is used to. So the goal will be<br/>to write music that is just heard as music with<br/>beautiful melodies, and gradually go into places where<br/>12-eq cannot go at all. So the tuning will come more<br/>and more into the forefront as the piece progresses.<br/>Will it work for a larger audience? I don&apos;t know. Some<br/>people tell me that average listeners will either hear<br/>the music as sounding the same as 12-eq, so why<br/>bother?--- or out of tune. Right now I want to develop<br/>myself as a composer so that the oratorio works as<br/>music, with all the elements of structure and<br/>expression in place. The tuning is an essential part<br/>of the composition, but not the only part. I make my<br/>living performing weddings, so I don&apos;t have to find a<br/>huge audience for this. My ears are very happy to hear<br/>the natural harmonies that are so muddied by 12-eq<br/>(yes, I have always disliked 12-eq: I have a facetious<br/>sign in my music room that says Ban 12-Equal: The 7-11<br/>of Tuning!).<br/>Chris Mohr</p><p>--- wallyesterpaulrus &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed<br/>&gt; &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s something we should be<br/>&gt; &gt; thinking about.

The<br/>Pythagorean comma would show itself as a &quot;wolf fifth&quot;<br/>from Bb to F, and whenever I played that interval,<br/>instead of hearing a pure fifth as I would with the<br/>other intervals on the keyboard, I would hear the<br/>&quot;wolf fifth.&quot; On my 53-eq keyboard, I have a Bb, a<br/>B&apos;b, a B&apos;&apos;b, a B,b, and a B,,b (sorry for the clumsy<br/>typed notation, but you get the idea). On my keyboard,<br/>the true Pythagorean Bb is actually a rank down on my<br/>five-tiered keyboard. Voila! No wolf fifth. The same<br/>principle can be applied when I confront any of the<br/>other commas in my composing.</p><p>Since the 53-equal perfect fifth is only .07 cents off<br/>from the pure fifth, and the 53-eq &quot;just&quot; third is<br/>only 1.4 cents from the fifth harmonic, I can very<br/>closely approximate the sound of just intonation and<br/>still modulate and chord-progress while still having<br/>&quot;escape hatches&quot; when I come up against any of these<br/>commas. The &quot;ideal&quot; would be to write in pure just<br/>intonation, but with 53-eq, I can notate and fix<br/>pitches which are at least finite in number. I can<br/>also create a &quot;circle&quot; of eight fifths and a third and<br/>come back home, much like composers using 12-eq can<br/>exploit the artificial &quot;circle of fifths.&quot;</p><p>By the way, the seventh harmonic is only 4 1/2 cents<br/>off, a noticeable discrepancy but much better than the<br/>31-cent discrepancy of 12-eq. 12-eq kind of erases all<br/>the commas too, but compromises the fifth and seventh<br/>harmonics so grossly in the process that to my ear,<br/>the sacrifice is not worth it. There are commas in the<br/>7-limit system as well, which I will be exploring<br/>eventually.</p><p>I hope this answers your question!</p><p>Chris Mohr</p><p>--- wallyesterpaulrus &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Mohr<br/>&gt; &lt;fromtherealmoftheshadow@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks Carl,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll be taking lessons from Allaudin Mathieu<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any relation to W.

For the next ten years or<br/>&gt; so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be working on a 53-eq oratorio, setting<br/>&gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; twenty sacred poems from around the world to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; music. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be choosing ancient scales that may have<br/>&gt; been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heard by these poets, and I&apos;ve chosen to start<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scales that sound very much like 12-eq (our<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; traditional major scale in pure Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost indistinguishable from 12-eq to a<br/>&gt; casual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listener, as long as you avoid the comma).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gradually I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will go into scales that take the ear further<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further from what it is used to. So the goal<br/>&gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to write music that is just heard as music<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful melodies, and gradually go into<br/>&gt; places<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 12-eq cannot go at all. So the tuning will<br/>&gt; come<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and more into the forefront as the piece<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; progresses.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Will it work for a larger audience? I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people tell me that average listeners will<br/>&gt; either<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hear<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the music as sounding the same as 12-eq, so<br/>&gt; why<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bother?--- or out of tune. Right now I want to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; develop<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself as a composer so that the oratorio<br/>&gt; works as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; music, with all the elements of structure and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expression in place. The tuning is an<br/>&gt; essential<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; part<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the composition, but not the only part. I<br/>&gt; make<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living performing weddings, so I don&apos;t have to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; find a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; huge audience for this.

Had something I care to add,<br/>in response to Gene&apos;s original posting:</p><p>I think there are three somewhat distinct stages of listening in<br/>a person&apos;s musical development.  They exist in relation to many<br/>characteristics, not just tuning.</p><p>The first is when the listener simply purely hears the music and<br/>feels whatever they feel about the affect, the tension and release,<br/>whatever.  The little kid who doesn&apos;t know from rock vs. country<br/>vs. whatever, who just experiences it and likes it or not.</p><p>The second is a huge range.  It is the experienced listener who<br/>can say B.S. like &quot;that&apos;s not rock&quot; or &quot;that&apos;s not in tune&quot; or &quot;that<br/>was a parallel fifth&quot; or &quot;that sounds like a sampled piano because<br/>I don&apos;t hear interaction between the various strings&apos; harmonics&quot;<br/>etc. etc.</p><p>The third is the open-minded musician who realizes that all<br/>the rules and style guidelines and everything are crap because<br/>the world isn&apos;t that simple and the whole point is to be in touch<br/>with the original way of just experiencing.  This listener knows<br/>what scales are and styles and history and theory, but knows<br/>that lots of things don&apos;t fit these boxes.  This listener is able to<br/>just listen and enjoy and connect with how they feel, regardless<br/>of whether they understand it or not.  Anyone at this level<br/>probably has the ability, to varying degree, to adjust their<br/>mode of listening at will.</p><p>I can say that with 100% of the totally unscientific experiences<br/>that I&apos;ve had playing microtonal music for various people that<br/>every single person at the first or third levels enjoys good<br/>microtonal music as much as any other music if not moreso.<br/>Furthermore, BOTH people at level 1 and level 3 often think<br/>the microtonal music is not particularly remarkable.  It just<br/>sounds like music to them.  Especially people at level 1, they<br/>think it&apos;s crazy to think this is weird music.  It doesn&apos;t even<br/>sound one bit different from anything else to them.  But the<br/>real point is that I&apos;ve had many people at level 3 who don&apos;t<br/>notice that the music is any different from normal unless I<br/>point it out.</p><p>My overall point is that I&apos;m quite convinced that only highly<br/>trained, and further only specialized and not very broadened<br/>musicians hear microtonality as weird or cacophonous.  It is<br/>an intellectual problem of fitting the music into their<br/>preconceived boxes.</p><p>On the other hand, don&apos;t forget that much microtonal music<br/>*is* cacophonous to a degree, or is weird and crazy, or is<br/>computery and chop-chop sounding.  In other words, I think<br/>many, many critics of microtonal music aren&apos;t critical of the<br/>tuning, but of the fact that relatively little of our new microtonal<br/>music, Partch included, is otherwise usual sounding.<br/>Partch&apos;s music is certainly not microtonal versions of traditional<br/>styles and playing methods, so how can they be compared?</p><p>One good point on this:  I know a musician who is fantastic and<br/>certainly has open-minded ears a la my listener number 3.  But,<br/>he is an advocate of, and loves 12TET and does not know anything<br/>about microtonality.  He has great ears and can hear tuning VERY<br/>well.  Actually, now that I think of it, I know a few musicians like<br/>this.  And when I play them barbershop recordings (or in one case,<br/>Toby Twining&apos;s Chrysalid Requiem), they do not marvel at the<br/>weirdness or write it off as weird.  They hear it like I do: fantastic<br/>beautiful music.  But in every case, they do not hear anything weird<br/>about it, so they say something like: &quot;well, that basically sounds<br/>pretty close to 12TET still.&quot;  Or my one professor&apos;s response to<br/>the Chrysalid Requiem:  &quot;Other than being too long, it is a very<br/>good composition.  I think, though, that the beauty is the<br/>compositional elements, and it would work just as well in 12TET.&quot;</p><p>I feel pretty certain when I say:  microtonal music that is otherwise<br/>similar to music people are used to is SO not strange that even<br/>trained musicians don&apos;t really even hear it as different.  There&apos;s<br/>only two groups of people who hear microtonality and take notice<br/>of the tuning particularly:  microtonal advocates who are really<br/>into the subteties of the tuning, and people at a mid-stage of<br/>training who worked hard to learn to hear 12TET pitches and are<br/>not yet at the learn-it-and-forget-it stage, so they aren&apos;t ready<br/>to step back and listen to the music, but instead try to analyze<br/>everything and get frustrated if they can&apos;t fit it into their intellectual<br/>box.</p><p>I am convinced that good microtonal music that doesn&apos;t try to<br/>be otherwise different, will be thought of by 95% of the population as<br/>just another piece of music.  But I believe they will like it more,<br/>along the same lines that people like a high fidelity recording<br/>made at 24-bit more than a recording made at 16-bit with<br/>lower quality gear, even though that same 95% couldn&apos;t identify<br/>that difference intellectually.  And of course, we need to remind<br/>ourselves that if the low-quality recording is a better piece of music<br/>(or the 12TET piece is otherwise a better piece) that *easily*<br/>overrides these other subtle differences.</p><p>Why don&apos;t most people like Partch?  It sounds crazy (to their ears), and<br/>not because it is microtonal.  Why don&apos;t some people like barbershop?<br/>Because it can be hokey, or they like drumbeats.  Why doesn&apos;t everyone<br/>like some of the list members&apos; MIDI music?  Hey, I made two albums<br/>of 12TET MIDI music and even though I thought (in High School at the<br/>time) that it was great composing, everyone said it sounded like video<br/>game computer music.  Why doesn&apos;t everyone like the Catler Brothers?<br/>Not everyone likes instrumental jazz-fusion music!  Where are the<br/>microtonal pop-radio recordings??

Mostly, like you, people implicitly treat 53 as a<br/>schismatic system, so that the pure major triad is C-Fb-G. However, we<br/>can get away from considering the circle of fifths at all, and use<br/>circles of other intervals. Another important 53 system, which I used,<br/>is orwell; this has a circle of 7/6 intervals, or 12 steps of 53. If<br/>you want to stick to the 5-limit, a good alternative to schismatic is<br/>hanson; this uses circles of 6/5 intervals, 14 steps of 53.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by the commas in the 7-limit system;<br/>generally in these contexts &quot;commas&quot; is taken to mean intervals the<br/>system tempers out. In the case of 53, in the 5-limit it tempers out<br/>the schisma, 32805/32768, and the kleisma, 15625/15552. These two<br/>together define 53 in the 5-limit, as Tanaka, who named the kleisma,<br/>implicitly discovered. The schisma is what gives you your circle of<br/>eight fifths and a major third.

It also makes the augmented triad into a 5/4-5/4-9/7<br/>chord, and gives you a 5/4, 5/4, 9/7 circle of thirds. 1728/1715<br/>vanishing means among other things that there is a circle of thirds<br/>going 7/6, 7/6, 7/6, 5/4, and a 7/6-7/6-7/6-5/4 chord.</p></div><h3><a id=65447 href="#65447">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2006 11:01:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right on!

Anyone at this level<br/>&gt; probably has the ability, to varying degree, to adjust their<br/>&gt; mode of listening at will.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can say that with 100% of the totally unscientific experiences<br/>&gt; that I&apos;ve had playing microtonal music for various people that<br/>&gt; every single person at the first or third levels enjoys good<br/>&gt; microtonal music as much as any other music if not moreso.<br/>&gt; Furthermore, BOTH people at level 1 and level 3 often think<br/>&gt; the microtonal music is not particularly remarkable.  It just<br/>&gt; sounds like music to them.  Especially people at level 1, they<br/>&gt; think it&apos;s crazy to think this is weird music.  It doesn&apos;t even<br/>&gt; sound one bit different from anything else to them.  But the<br/>&gt; real point is that I&apos;ve had many people at level 3 who don&apos;t<br/>&gt; notice that the music is any different from normal unless I<br/>&gt; point it out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My overall point is that I&apos;m quite convinced that only highly<br/>&gt; trained, and further only specialized and not very broadened<br/>&gt; musicians hear microtonality as weird or cacophonous.  It is<br/>&gt; an intellectual problem of fitting the music into their<br/>&gt; preconceived boxes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the other hand, don&apos;t forget that much microtonal music<br/>&gt; *is* cacophonous to a degree, or is weird and crazy, or is<br/>&gt; computery and chop-chop sounding.  In other words, I think<br/>&gt; many, many critics of microtonal music aren&apos;t critical of the<br/>&gt; tuning, but of the fact that relatively little of our new microtonal<br/>&gt; music, Partch included, is otherwise usual sounding.<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s music is certainly not microtonal versions of traditional<br/>&gt; styles and playing methods, so how can they be compared?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One good point on this:  I know a musician who is fantastic and<br/>&gt; certainly has open-minded ears a la my listener number 3.  But,<br/>&gt; he is an advocate of, and loves 12TET and does not know anything<br/>&gt; about microtonality.  He has great ears and can hear tuning VERY<br/>&gt; well.  Actually, now that I think of it, I know a few musicians like<br/>&gt; this.  And when I play them barbershop recordings (or in one case,<br/>&gt; Toby Twining&apos;s Chrysalid Requiem), they do not marvel at the<br/>&gt; weirdness or write it off as weird.  They hear it like I do:<br/>&gt; fantastic beautiful music.  But in every case, they do not hear<br/>&gt; anything weird about it, so they say something like: &quot;well, that<br/>&gt; basically sounds pretty close to 12TET still.&quot;  Or my one<br/>&gt; professor&apos;s response to the Chrysalid Requiem:  &quot;Other than<br/>&gt; being too long, it is a very good composition.  I think, though,<br/>&gt; that the beauty is the compositional elements, and it would work<br/>&gt; just as well in 12TET.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel pretty certain when I say:  microtonal music that is<br/>&gt; otherwise similar to music people are used to is SO not strange<br/>&gt; that even trained musicians don&apos;t really even hear it as<br/>&gt; different.  There&apos;s only two groups of people who hear<br/>&gt; microtonality and take notice of the tuning particularly:<br/>&gt; microtonal advocates who are really into the subteties of the<br/>&gt; tuning, and people at a mid-stage of training who worked hard<br/>&gt; to learn to hear 12TET pitches and are not yet at the<br/>&gt; learn-it-and-forget-it stage, so they aren&apos;t ready to step back<br/>&gt; and listen to the music, but instead try to analyze everything<br/>&gt; and get frustrated if they can&apos;t fit it into their intellectual<br/>&gt; box.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am convinced that good microtonal music that doesn&apos;t try to<br/>&gt; be otherwise different, will be thought of by 95% of the<br/>&gt; population as just another piece of music.  But I believe they<br/>&gt; will like it more, along the same lines that people like a high<br/>&gt; fidelity recording made at 24-bit more than a recording made<br/>&gt; at 16-bit with lower quality gear, even though that same 95%<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t identify that difference intellectually.  And of<br/>&gt; course, we need to remind ourselves that if the low-quality<br/>&gt; recording is a better piece of music (or the 12TET piece is<br/>&gt; otherwise a better piece) that *easily* overrides these other<br/>&gt; subtle differences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why don&apos;t most people like Partch?  It sounds crazy (to their<br/>&gt; ears), and not because it is microtonal.  Why don&apos;t some people<br/>&gt; like barbershop?  Because it can be hokey, or they like<br/>&gt; drumbeats.  Why doesn&apos;t everyone like some of the list members&apos;<br/>&gt; MIDI music?  Hey, I made two albums of 12TET MIDI music and<br/>&gt; even though I thought (in High School at the time) that it was<br/>&gt; great composing, everyone said it sounded like video game<br/>&gt; computer music.</p><p>How ironic -- video game music is now cool and incredibly<br/>popular.</p><p>&gt; Why doesn&apos;t everyone like the Catler Brothers?<br/>&gt; Not everyone likes instrumental jazz-fusion music!

There&apos;s some reason<br/>to think we&apos;re entering the &quot;long tail&quot; phase of media... in the<br/>near future, 22-tET musicians may entertain the same niche-type<br/>audiences as every other kind of musician.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=65452 href="#65452">ðŸ”—</a>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@smartelectronix.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2006 2:10:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>While I really appreciate the harmony in choraled, there is one thing that really bores me:</p><p>- It sounds mechanical.

If they aren&apos;t all that<br/>&gt; cacophanous, why the reaction?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I find the first to be the most &quot;cacophonous&quot; particularly due to the<br/>obnoxious, constant vibrato in the timbre.</p><p>This is a bit off of the tuning issue, but at any rate, I don&apos;t think tuning<br/>is responsible for most of how I perceive these pieces.  So here&apos;s my<br/>simple statement:</p><p>I teach my beginner students to think of musical experiences on a<br/>spectrum from *boring* to *confusing*.  In between is *interesting*.</p><p>Without any further explanation, I find the dynamics (volume and<br/>similar features), timbres, and textures of all your pieces to be quite<br/>extremely on the boring side.  On the other hand, the melodies and<br/>forms and polyphony is on the confusing side.  In other words, I can<br/>predictably expect constant electronic timbres and certain sorts of<br/>rhythms overall.  As far as melody and harmony, I have a very hard<br/>time making sense of things on a first listen.  I can tell that there<br/>is enough structure that I could do better with further listening.<br/>However, the timbres are so harsh overall that I could not bear<br/>to listen to the pieces all the way through even once.</p><p>I doubt that otherwise similar music in 12TET would be heard that<br/>differently by any casual listener.  Simply put, the timbres and<br/>lack of dynamic elements will turn off anybody who is not intellectually<br/>intrigued by the tuning.</p><p>Sorry to be so harsh.  But do realize that I&apos;m not inherently saying<br/>anything bad about your composing or tuning.  But it gets<br/>hidden by the other factors in what makes up the listening<br/>experience.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=65485 href="#65485">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2006 9:55:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; How ironic -- video game music is now cool and incredibly<br/>&gt; popular.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah, and actually many critics who called my music &quot;video game<br/>music&quot; still LIKED it, and I sold a lot of albums compared to the fact<br/>that I had no way to present the music or get it out to the world.</p><p>But my point is that I hadn&apos;t thought of my own music like that at<br/>all, and I didn&apos;t exactly want the association.

It seems to me there is a hell<br/>&gt; of a lot more going on in a Bach fugue or a Beethoven string quartet<br/>&gt; than the sound it makes, and ignoring that aspect simply ignores what<br/>&gt; is best and most interesting about music. The music I like best, at<br/>&gt; any rate, was not composed for people who merely love the sound it makes.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Please don&apos;t try to keep separating things like this.  There&apos;s no &quot;mere&quot;<br/>anything.  The whole experience is what it is.  It has parts, but is greater<br/>than their sum.  Would you expect people to enjoy a movie if the theatre<br/>has the sound so loud it is truly painful and the focus of the projector is<br/>completely out of whack?  &quot;But the point is the beatiful story!&quot; you could say.<br/>But nobody could make it out!  There&apos;s a complete range of these things<br/>and the are rarely at the extremes.  Most well-acted, beautifully written<br/>movies do not also have the absolutely greatest lighting, but the better<br/>it is, great.  And the best lighting for a drama is one that does not call<br/>attention to itself.  It is the lighting that best focuses your ear on the<br/>elements that are meant to be focused on.</p><p>In your recording, the soundfonts distract me from the compositional<br/>elements, because they are THAT extreme (to MY ears).  A budget,<br/>independant film simply will never have the quality or even the personell<br/>to do everything as well as a big budget film, but sometimes the writing<br/>is so good that we love the independant film more than the typical<br/>hollywood hit.  But this is NEVER the case if the indy film has sound<br/>quality or video quality so low that average listeners have difficulty<br/>making out the dialogue or identifying the characters.</p><p>It is foolish to try to ignore these things.  And just as foolish to try<br/>to dream up the greatest whatever that has every single element<br/>in place perfectly.</p><p>The &quot;music&quot; of it all?  I never said it was all in the timbre.  But it<br/>CERTAINLY IS in the actual aural experience in time.  Not on the<br/>paper.  That&apos;s like enjoying a house by looking at the architectural<br/>blueprint.</p><p>&gt;  It almost sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; like you&apos;re asking me to listen to the notation.  Saying: I wish<br/>&gt; people could<br/>&gt; &gt; listen to the dots on the paper.  You can&apos;t listen to that, you can<br/>&gt; only look<br/>&gt; &gt; at it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, some people *can* listen to it, but sadly, my abilities in<br/>&gt; that direction are sorely limited.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&quot;Imagine&quot; is the word you want.  People can *imagine* it.  They cannot<br/>listen to it.  And in order to imagine it they need something to relate<br/>it to.  Professional musicians relate to sounds and playing they are<br/>familiar with.  It is possible to listen to a MIDI violin and *imagine*<br/>a real one.  But if you are asking people to do this, you&apos;ll have to<br/>either get a LOT closer to the real thing, or accept that your audience<br/>is limited to an infinitesimally small group of trained and motivated<br/>friends who like you enough to give your piece a chance and do all<br/>the work of imagining its potential.</p><p>&gt;  I highly suggest you stop trying to alter the way humans hear, and<br/>&gt; &gt; instead say, &quot;I wish I could get my music performed by expressive<br/>&gt; &gt; instrumentalists who could do it justice.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How does one do that, exactly? I&apos;m not a music professional.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If I had an answer that took less than years of dedication to acheive a<br/>half-way result, I&apos;d like to think I&apos;d be a world-renound composer<br/>already.  The half answer is that the more you buy into currently existing<br/>systems, genres, and formats, and try not to do anything way out of<br/>the ordinary, the easier it is to find people to realize your music.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Or a realistic option:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;I&apos;m sure glad technology has been constantly improving, so I&apos;m sure<br/>&gt; &gt; someday soon I&apos;ll be able to make a more listenable rendition even if<br/>&gt; &gt; it will never be quite perfect&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Amen to that. I am sure the situation will continue to improve, but<br/>&gt; meanwhile why disparage what we have as unlistenable?</p><p>I can listen to mediocre MIDI stuff.  Really.  I&apos;ve made a lot of it.<br/>And my barbershop thing, using REAL voices is robotic and<br/>not perfectly mixed and beautiful even.  And I expect at least<br/>for tuning people to listen past that and hear the other elements.<br/>It&apos;s all a range.

But I have a music degree and have been<br/>studying and reading music for years, and I am still nowhere<br/>near actually experiencing in my imagination the music from<br/>a written score.  I can take it element by element or part by part,<br/>but I can&apos;t do anything close to experiencing the actual music.<br/>However, if I read a barbershop score I can pretty much sense<br/>a lot of the music, and same thing if I read a classical guitar<br/>score.  But in this case, a large part is relating similar note<br/>patterns and sounds to what I&apos;ve actually experienced.  I think<br/>what I&apos;m really saying is:  When it comes to unique, creative music,<br/>I think only a miniscule percentage of even trained musicians can<br/>get something from a score that is remotely on the level of an<br/>actual realization.</p><p>On the same level, I love books, but I think that book-lovers<br/>are fooling themselves when they argue that it&apos;s unfortunate<br/>that movies are generally more popular and accessible than<br/>books.  I totally agree that books offer something movies<br/>do not and I am an avid reader.  But, movies, with visuals and<br/>sound simply are more in touch with direct human perception<br/>and do in fact reach people more directly.  And yes, this results<br/>in many people not developing as deep an imagination, and<br/>that is unfortunate.  But, we shouldn&apos;t deny the facts of human<br/>perception that lead to this situation.</p><p>In the case of books, it is people&apos;s experience hearing actual<br/>conversation and seeing movies and etc. etc. that gives them a<br/>basis for their imagination when reading.</p><p>Back to the music of it all, I think the biggest issue is our poor,<br/>piano-based notation system.  I don&apos;t have a better suggestion,<br/>but I can certainly say that I can *imagine* reading a music<br/>notation that makes imagining the music much more easy.</p><p>Still, someone with limited or no experience listening to the *real*<br/>sounds of a particular instrument or sort of music will be much<br/>hampered in their ability to imagine it from the score.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=65596 href="#65596">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@mappi.helsinki.fi&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2006 6:55:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It timbre is less annoying than in Gene&apos;s version, but it&apos;s no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more musical, and perhaps more boring.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the adjective &quot;musical&quot; mean?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Literally it just means &quot;related to music&quot; but it often has the<br/>&gt; &gt; connotation of &quot;musically expressive&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; They are totally subjective concepts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yup, I was posting as to my subjective opinion.</p><p>As Klaus Schmirler said expressive stuff is timbre change not timbres<br/>themselves.</p><p>I would say expressiveness is a property of the instrument (or<br/>synthesizer patch in electronic context).

Besides, if I want to affect the sound in this way I<br/>use effects plugins.</p><p>&gt; I for one have a hard time understanding the mind set of those who<br/>&gt; think that music is just melody, rhythm and harmony (not talking about<br/>&gt; anyone particular). These are of course very important musical<br/>&gt; parameters but for me they provide just the skeleton of the music.</p><p>For me, saying that they are just the skeleton is a bit over-stated,<br/>but I absolutely agree that they are but one part (albeit large) of<br/>the musical experience. I tend to think that when thought of in that<br/>manner - as a triumvirate - they show a Western bias. I&apos;m sure most of<br/>the readers of the list are aware of other musical cultures that don&apos;t<br/>depend on all three elements, and certainly trends in contemporary -<br/>both pop and non-pop - musics show interest and depth in other areas<br/>of musical materials and construction.</p><p>Yep, music is a very big sandbox. Who to pop in the player next -<br/>Lorraine Hunt Lieberson or Squarepusher?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=65603 href="#65603">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2006 8:55:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I can state positively that when *i* read a score,<br/>&gt; i can &quot;hear&quot; it in my head.</p><p>How do people learn to &quot;hear&quot; more than one line?</p></div><h3><a id=65604 href="#65604">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2006 4:57:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;How do people learn to &quot;hear&quot; more than one line?</p><p>Gene --</p><p>I can only describe my own experience, but it started with playing in ensembles as an instrumentalist or singer.  Once you have your own part under control, you discover that you can follow other lines as well, gradually adding additional lines.  This unfolds at the same time that you start to recognize vertical combinations from the perspective of your own part. Learning species counterpoint, and in particular being asked by my teacher to sing one part and play another, and eventually playing several lines, both composed and improvised, was critical to my own development as a musician.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t only apply to classical western music. When I first played Javanese music, I was really overwhelmed by the density of the ensemble. I asked Harjito for some guidance, and he said that as a child, he first listened to the saron part (a basic melodic outline), and then added the drum, and then the male vocal, then the rebab, then the female vocal, etc., gradually accumulating the whole ensemble. When I asked him what he listened to now, he simply said &quot;everything&quot;, and having rehearsed with him for years, listening to him correct players, I can verify that he was not overstating his skills.</p><p>In practice, I suppose that my attention is continuously jumping about from line to line, and that I have internalized a large number of cues about how the lines work together (voice leading), but it does feel awfully smooth, as if the individual lines are essentially intact as melodies. (In fact, I may even overdue it a bit -- I recently heard a school orchestra concert, where the finale of the Brahms&apos; 4th was played. In the underground, going home, I kept hearing an odd melody in my head. When I got home, and checked out the score, it turned out to have come from the viola part...)</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=65606 href="#65606">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2006 6:25:46 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 19 Mar 2006 02, monz wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Carl, Gene, and Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saying: I wish people could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listen to the dots on the paper.<br/>&gt; &gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, some people *can* listen to it, but sadly, my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; abilities in that direction are sorely limited.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In fact, a lot of the same neurons are active as when they<br/>&gt; &gt; hear the sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl, i&apos;m really glad that you posted that, because i<br/>&gt; wanted to respond to this earlier but refrained.</p><p>Me too!</p><p>&gt; I can state positively that when *i* read a score,<br/>&gt; i can &quot;hear&quot; it in my head. That is, as long as it&apos;s<br/>&gt; not *too* complicated -- so Ferneyhough, for example,<br/>&gt; and for that matter Ben Johnston too, are not included here.</p><p>Yes, you do need a peg to hang your &quot;reading&quot; on.  But<br/>even reading the most complex modern score has some<br/>elements in common with reading a more standard score.<br/>Because of that, one can still form a very good impression<br/>of how much of it will be realised in sound.  This is like my<br/>being able to understand a good deal of written Rumanian,<br/>based on my knowledge of other Romance languages like<br/>French and Spanish.  There are gaps, but I&apos;m not blind to<br/>the whole meaning of the writing.</p><p>When it gets too complicated is when there are too many<br/>parts to take in by eye at once.</p><p>&gt; (to Aaron:) Yes, of course i realize that this is not<br/>&gt; *really* hearing, but is in fact imagining. But to me,<br/>&gt; there&apos;s really no difference.</p><p>Me too!  And I hear most of my music &quot;in my head&quot; -<br/>and very fully at that, long before I write anything<br/>down or hear it in actuality.</p><p>&gt; When you read a book (a work of fiction) which has<br/>&gt; characters speaking to each other, if the author is<br/>&gt; a good writer, i&apos;d bet that you &quot;hear&quot; the dialog in<br/>&gt; the context of how you imagine each character to sound.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know that when i read, say, _Tom Sawyer_, i can<br/>&gt; *easily* &quot;hear&quot; Tom and Huck talking to each other.</p><p>Me too!  In fact, after reading a novel set in Atlanta,<br/>I have to consciously refrain from talking with a<br/>Southern (US) drawl.  And this is strange, because I&apos;ve<br/>never been there ...</p><p>&gt; For me, it&apos;s the same thing when i read a score.</p><p>Me too!</p><p>&gt; Yes, i realize that this is very far from how the<br/>&gt; &quot;average&quot; listener responds to a piece of music.</p><p>Don&apos;t know about that.
