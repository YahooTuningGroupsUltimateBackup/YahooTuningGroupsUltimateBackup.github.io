But _any_ tuning may be approximated as closely<br/>as one likes by using ratios of large enough whole numbers. For example the<br/>Hammond organ tuning, which is indistinguishable from 12 tone equal<br/>temperament and is therefore not justly intoned, is based on ratios of<br/>whole numbers no larger than 85. It has all its intervals within 1 cent of<br/>a perfect 12-tET.</p><p>The opposite mistake is to attempt to define JI by limiting the size of the<br/>whole numbers such that ratios of greater than 5, 19, 43, or whatever, are<br/>said never to be JI. The fact is that chords with more notes, and sustained<br/>for longer periods, allow higher number ratios to be experienced as justly<br/>intoned. The most extreme form we are aware of is the Dream House<br/>installation of LaMonte Young, which goes beyond the ratios used in the<br/>Hammond organ tuning, but is considered JI by many.</p><p>Some of William Sethares&apos; spectrum-based scales for timbres having<br/>inharmonic partials are considered a form of just intonation, but they<br/>involve irrational numbers.</p><p>Also, barbershop singing uses just intonation, but no arithmetic of any<br/>kind is involved. It&apos;s all done by ear.</p><p>The problem in all cases is the attempt to define what is fundamentally an<br/>auditory experience, in (overly simple) mathematical terms. Here&apos;s one way<br/>to _experience_ what is meant by just intonation.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Injunctive definition of a &quot;just interval&quot;</p><p>Take a sustained harmonic timbre such as human voice, strings or a<br/>synthetic sawtooth wave (or almost any timbre if it&apos;s played loud enough).<br/>Do not use vibrato, reverb, chorus or any other special effects. While<br/>sounding one tone at constant pitch, very slowly sweep another tone up from<br/>that. Sometimes you hear &quot;wah wah wah&quot;. This is called beating. Notice when<br/>the beating slows down and eventually stops before speeding up again. Those<br/>sharply defined regions where the beats seem to stop are the &quot;just<br/>intervals&quot;, &quot;justly intoned intervals&quot;, &quot;JI intervals&quot;, &quot;pure intervals&quot;.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the above case, with a typical harmonic timbre and only two simultaneous<br/>notes, the just intervals _will_ correspond to regions within a few cents<br/>either side of small whole number ratios of frequency, where the product of<br/>the two sides of the ratio (in lowest terms) is no greater than about 100.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Descriptive definition of &quot;just intonation&quot;</p><p>Intonation is the property of having accurate pitch or the process of<br/>obtaining accurate pitch.</p><p>Just intonation is accuracy of one pitch in relation to another pitch, such<br/>that the resulting interval sounds harmonically pure; perfectly in tune;<br/>without beating. Such an interval is called a &quot;just interval&quot;, &quot;justly<br/>intoned interval&quot;, &quot;JI interval&quot; or &quot;pure interval&quot;.</p><p>The property of just intonation is also said to be posessed by a musical<br/>work, a body of musical works, or parts of a musical work, such as a<br/>passage, tuning, scale or chord, when these contain a significant number of<br/>appropriately related just intervals.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>So what counts as a &quot;significant number&quot; of just intervals for these<br/>various musical entities, and what is &quot;appropriately related&quot;.</p><p>Definition:<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Justly intoned scale or Just scale (abbreviated JI scale)</p><p>A justly intoned scale is is one where every pitch can be reached from<br/>every other pitch by some chain of justly intoned intervals.</p><p>Consider a graph with a vertex for each pitch of the scale and an edge for<br/>each justly intoned interval, then a JI scale corresponds to a connected<br/>graph. It has at least a single spanning tree. A non-JI scale has two or<br/>more unconnected subgraphs.</p><p>If an interval is only perceptible as justly intoned when in some harmonic<br/>context larger than the bare interval, such an interval will count as<br/>justly intoned for the purpose of the above definition only if the scale is<br/>capable of providing that context.</p><p>If the intervals needed to connect the graph are only perceptible as justly<br/>intoned when a particular (usually inharmonic) timbre (or class of timbres)<br/>is used, then we say the scale is justly intoned for that timbre (or class<br/>of timbres).<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>What goes for &quot;JI scale&quot; above also goes for &quot;JI tuning&quot; and &quot;JI chord&quot; or<br/>&quot;JI sonority&quot;.</p><p>There is no need to rigorously define what a &quot;significant number&quot; is for a<br/>passage or work or body of work, but if more than half of it consists of<br/>just chords or uses a just scale or tuning, I would be inclined to call it<br/>JI. But of course &quot;microtonal&quot; is a good catch-all for non 12-tET tunings.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2000 7:45:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16287">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16287</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The single most important change to your dictionary definition<br/>&gt; of JI would be to get rid of the part that says &quot;Any tuning<br/>&gt; system which exclusively employs intervals defined by ratios of<br/>&gt; integers may be called Just Intonation&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;etc. ...snip&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Dave K.

While<br/>it&apos;s certainly fine to acknowledge that people may disagree and give<br/>alternatives within the post, I am of the school that likes the simple<br/>definition of JI as tuning by integer ratios.</p><p>I don&apos;t wish to recapitulate this whole endless debate, but to insert my<br/>1/600th of an octave: I think that there is value in defining JI from the<br/>perspective of the composer/tuner. That is, if they think of it in terms of<br/>ratios, then it&apos;s JI, even if those ratios are large, even if they function<br/>non-harmonically, even if they are not derived from harmonics, even if<br/>there are tiny but inevitable mistakes due to human error or<br/>non-linearities of the material etc.</p><p>To say that this or that ratio is too large to be considered JI first of<br/>all becomes highly subjective. I think that La Monte Young has demonstrated<br/>that in certain contexts, there is an audible difference between rational<br/>ratios and close but irrational ones. Secondly, just because a ratio is<br/>complex with respect to a particular 1/1 does not mean that it will be at<br/>all points in the piece.</p><p>I think that there is a great benefit to communication to distinguish<br/>between tuning intended to be by integer ratios (just intonation) and<br/>tuning by ratios not meant to be reducible to integers (temperament).<br/>Inserting various exceptions based on subjective interpretations will<br/>only breed confusion, in my opinion, so please, Joe, at least acknowledge<br/>these different interpretations of the term.</p><p>And, by the way, I don&apos;t see how under any stretch of a definition that<br/>Sethares&apos; use of non-harmonic partials as a basis for tuning could be<br/>considered just intonation. JI is not about matching partials -- that&apos;s<br/>just one effect when the tuning is otonal and the timbres harmonic.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Were you to add an electronic speed control to that motor, you could produce gliding or sliding tones and chords (glissandos) still maintaining 12 tet relationships.  Perhaps someone has done this to use it for the Hawaiian guitar style of music.

Such beating works against any &quot;scale&quot; other than one of octaves only and even then the inharmonic partials work against it.  With most instruments, the partials are weaker by far than the fundamentals and this beating is not a very significant problem.  The alternative is to go with the Hammond organ type of tone generation, in which all the partials are also in 12 tet.<br/>As for the frenetic pace of much of Western music up to New Age music, I believe it is partly to conceal this beating but also to prevent the building up of standing wave resonances in rooms with parallel pairs of reflective surfaces (walls, floors and ceilings).  The exception that might prove this is pipe organs, which are voiced (adjusted pipe by pipe in volume output) to match the resonances of the room, hall, church or auditorium they are played in.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:ligonj@northstate.net">ligonj@northstate.net</a> 12/07/00 10:41AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16318">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16318</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Worse than that I&apos;d say... situations like Wendy Carlos&apos; &quot;Partch&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; Folly&quot; are the inevitable place that Dave&apos;s line of reasoning<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could someone please run this by me...
