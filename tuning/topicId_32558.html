I think there is, possibly, a<br/>large body of &quot;lurkers&quot; out there... judging by the private e-mails I<br/>get from time to time.  They are just a bit too &quot;intimidated&quot; to<br/>respond...  But that doesn&apos;t mean, necessarily, they aren&apos;t *reading*<br/>the list.  Otherwise, they would eventually unsubscribe, no??</p><p>In fact, there are even present &quot;lurkers&quot; that we know well and whom<br/>I *know* are lurking.  Wim Hoogewerf comes to mind.  Hi Wim!</p><p>At least, several of the &quot;lurkers&quot; have communicated with me<br/>privately... (I admit, not 500!)</p><p>It&apos;s the &quot;silent majority...&quot;</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 9:01:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Any true evidence of that statement??</p><p>No way to tell, just judge by comparing with other lists.</p><p>&gt; I think there is, possibly, a<br/>&gt; large body of &quot;lurkers&quot; out there... judging by the private e-mails<br/>&gt; I get from time to time.</p><p>Most lists contain a fair portion of lurkers.

There is probably a good number that reads it, as well as<br/>others that either have no email delivery and they don&apos;t need to look<br/>at the web, or those that let them clog some inbox somewhere.</p><p>Tell you what: the best list I belong to is *much* larger than this,<br/>and has entire communities of people that post. You can watch the<br/>waves of correspondence change with generalized topic areas, and the<br/>ensuing flow of information contains so many variety of (informed)<br/>insights that it is staggering. When a list is dominated - for<br/>whatever reason - or marginalized - by whatever constraints - it<br/>becomes less valuable Than It Could Be.</p><p>None of the preceding diminishes the value of the Mother Tuning List.<br/>But all things could be better, including our home.
