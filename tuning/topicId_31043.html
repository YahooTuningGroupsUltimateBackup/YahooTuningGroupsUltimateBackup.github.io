Or are we going to<br/>have to come up with *more*<br/>software/spreadsheets/hardware/algorhithms to &apos;listen&apos; to a piece,<br/>compare the digitized sound with the scanned score (or adjusted midi<br/>file) and see if the aural and the notational match?</p><p>&quot;Errors in your piece&quot;...
