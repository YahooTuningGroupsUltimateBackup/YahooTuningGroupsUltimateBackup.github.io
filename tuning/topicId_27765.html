Graham Breed has<br/>&gt; &gt; a *very* accurate one...  Kyma, Rayma (??)<br/>&gt; Anyway, it goes to, I<br/>&gt; &gt; believe, a fraction of a cent.. (??)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, it&apos;s rather costly...</p><p>My SB Live! soundcard is not bad for accuracy<br/>of pitch - correct to within +-0.2 cents. I don&apos;t know<br/>how typical or otherwise this is for a modern soundcard.</p><p>The new section in Fractal Tune Smithy for wave counting,<br/>though in a very unfinished state, is already quite useful for checking<br/>the pitch accuracy of a soundcard, especially if one can<br/>find a sine wave like MIDI voice to play, or a repeating waveform<br/>(if interested, maybe I&apos;ll add a section to the beta preview<br/>download page explaining how to use it to do this).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
