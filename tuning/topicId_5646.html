Historical issues: &quot;tunability&quot; and chirality<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Like the larger archicembalo of Vicentino and Sambuca Lincea of<br/>Colonna (Section 2), a 24-note archicembalo for fifthtone music raises<br/>interesting issues regarding an &quot;historically appropriate&quot; or<br/>&quot;authentic&quot; tuning.[25]</p><p>We might divide the tuning question into two basic parts. First,<br/>should we use 1/4-comma meantone with its subtly unequal fifthtones,<br/>or 31-tet? Here the arguments may be mostly the same for a 24-note<br/>instrument as for the complete 31-note or larger keyboards of<br/>Vicentino and Colonna.</p><p>Secondly, if we choose a 1/4-comma tuning, the question of chirality<br/>(Section 3) arises: which enharmonic notes should be tuned as flats or<br/>sharps?  Here a 24-note tuning may invite a simpler answer than a<br/>31-note tuning, where arbitrary convention, the nature of the music to<br/>be played, and intriguing questions of intonational aesthetics may all<br/>play a part.[26]</p><p>As to the first or general question, the beauty of 1/4-comma tuning is<br/>that it happily approximates a division by equal fifthtones[27] while<br/>fitting the advice of both Vicentino and Colonna that the usual notes<br/>on their instruments are tuned &quot;as on ordinary keyboards,&quot; serving as<br/>a foundation for the rest of the tuning.</p><p>Vicentino tells us that the 12 notes of his first two ranks (see<br/>Section 2) are tuned as on usual instruments, with the fifths<br/>&quot;somewhat blunted, as the good masters do it.&quot;[28] Colonna similarly<br/>states that his ranks of basic diatonic notes, sharps (+2/5-tone), and<br/>flats (+3/5-tone) are tuned as on &quot;common chromatic harpsichords&quot;<br/>(_Cembali Chromatici communi_) of 19 notes, the remaining enharmonic<br/>ranks then being accorded with these.[29] This latter remark may<br/>reflect the popularity of such 19-note keyboards among Neapolitan<br/>musicians around 1600.</p><p>As a well-documented 16th-century temperament quite practical to tune<br/>by ear, 1/4-comma meantone with its pure major thirds would seem to<br/>fit these descriptions better than a precise 31-tet division. In 1523,<br/>Pietro Aaron directs that at least one major third (C-E) be tuned<br/>&quot;sonorous and just, as blending as possible,&quot; while Zarlino (1571) and<br/>Salinas (1577) define the 1/4-comma tuning in systematic and<br/>mathematical terms. While Zarlino calls this &quot;a new temperament,&quot;<br/>Salinas claims that he was regarded as its inventor during his<br/>youthful stay in Rome, where he arrived in 1538.[30]</p><p>In practice, the 1/4-comma tuning approximates Vicentino&apos;s or<br/>Colonna&apos;s model of apparently equal fifthtones much as the Earth<br/>approximates, but does not precisely conform to, the shape of a<br/>sphere. When carried to 31 notes, the result is a circulating<br/>temperament of the kind described by these authors, albeit with subtle<br/>asymmetries -- quite possibly overshadowed by those resulting from the<br/>vagaries of the tuning process itself.[31]</p><p>If we do choose a 1/4-comma meantone, then the second question of<br/>chirality arises. Here both the tuning process itself and the intended<br/>repertory may influence the decision. Curiously, the use of &quot;authentic<br/>historical approaches&quot; might lead to a different tuning of certain<br/>notes on a 24-note instrument than on Vicentino&apos;s, for example.</p><p>With our 24-note instrument intended mainly for the Renaissance<br/>fifthtone compositions of Vicentino and Bernard, or for new music in<br/>similar styles, tuning all enharmonic notes at the flat end of the<br/>chain is an obvious choice.</p><p>From an &quot;historical tunability&quot; perspective, this approach seems the<br/>natural one because it tunes all 24 notes as a single chain of fifths<br/>(Eb*-G#). One might say: &quot;Simply place the first manual in a usual<br/>Eb-G# tuning with pure major thirds, and then, starting at Eb, carry<br/>the tuning an additional 12 fifths down on the second manual.&quot;</p><p>One could carry out the tuning of the second manual as a series of<br/>pure major thirds: first Ab-C, Db-F, and Gb-C; then the remaining<br/>enharmonic notes, B*(Cb)-Eb, E*(Fb)-Ab, A*(Bbb)-Db, etc.</p><p>Musically, this tuning provides usual meantone major and minor thirds<br/>for all regularly spelled sonorities within its range; and tuning all<br/>enharmonic notes as flats also has this advantage in the Ab-C#/Ab*-Db<br/>or Bb-D#/Bb*-Eb ranges called for by Vicentino&apos;s fifthtone pieces.</p><p>While this flat-end tuning seems the natural one for our 24-note<br/>archicembalo, it yields some intervals differing from those in a<br/>1/4-comma realization of Vicentino&apos;s scheme, which generally places<br/>enharmonic notes on the sharp end of the chain. Specifically,<br/>proximate minor thirds will vary, as in this variety of cadential<br/>flourish discussed in Section 1 where the outer voices stand at the<br/>fifth while the middle voice ascends from minor to major third:</p><p>             Vicentino: Eb* = D##<br/>             --------------------<br/>  G3<br/>(386.31)           (351.32)           (310.26)<br/>  Eb3 -- +34.99 -- Eb*3=D## -- +41.06 -- E3<br/>(310.26)   SF      (345.25)      LF   (386.31)<br/>  C3</p><p>              24-note: Eb* = Fbb<br/>              ------------------<br/>  G3<br/>(386.31)           (345.25)           (310.26)<br/>  Eb3 -- +41.06 -- Eb*3=Fbb -- +34.99 -- E3<br/>(310.26)   LF      (351.32)      SF   (386.31)<br/>  C3</p><p>In Vicentino&apos;s sharp-end tuning, the middle voice moves by a small<br/>fifthtone followed by a large fifthtone (SF-LF), while our flat-end<br/>tuning has the converse sequence -- and also a converse arrangement<br/>of the slightly unequal proximate minor thirds in the second sonority.<br/>Note that the smaller of these thirds, ~345.25 cents, is closer to<br/>Vicentino&apos;s approximate ratio of 11:9 (~347.41 cents); the larger,<br/>~351.32 cents, is almost identical to a pure 49:40 (~351.34 cents).</p><p>While matching Vicentino&apos;s chirality might seem ideally &quot;authentic,&quot;<br/>on a 24-note instrument it would involve the unlikely procedure of two<br/>disconnected chains of fifths: Cb(B*)-G# and D##(Eb*)-D###(E*). Tuning<br/>along a single chain of fifths, Eb*-G#, seems far more in keeping with<br/>16th-century procedures such as Vicentino&apos;s: natural variations may be<br/>more authentic than absolute uniformity.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>5. Meantone ranges, retuning, and transposition<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>As discussed in Section 1, our 24-note archicembalo fits the musical<br/>requirements of 16th-century fifthtone compositions by Vicentino and<br/>Bertrand fitting into a &quot;dual meantone&quot; gamut such as Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab.</p><p>Fortunately, each of Vicentino&apos;s and Bertrand&apos;s pieces fit into such a<br/>24-note range. Possibly not quite so fortunately, different pieces use<br/>different 24-note ranges: Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab, Ab-C#/Ab*-Db, or Bb-D#/Bb*-Eb.</p><p>This situation is closely analogous to the more usual predicament of<br/>using a 12-note meantone keyboard to play Renaissance pieces having<br/>different 12-note ranges (Eb-G#, Ab-C#, Bb-D#). The obvious solution<br/>is to retune between pieces, choosing the versions of G#/Ab and Eb/D#<br/>needed for a specific piece.</p><p>This same solution is the obvious one for our 24-note archicembalo,<br/>with a few complications added by the factor of _two_ keyboards.<br/>Linking our three 24-note ranges to specific pieces of Vicentino and<br/>Bertrand may make issues more concrete.</p><p>Since Eb-G# enjoys a status as the usual 12-note range in Renaissance<br/>theory and practice, it seems natural to regard an Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab tuning<br/>as &quot;standard.&quot; This tuning fits Bertrand&apos;s single known enharmonic<br/>chanson _Ie suis tellement amoureux_ (1578), and also Vicentino&apos;s<br/>example in his treatise of 1555 giving the opening of his madrigal<br/>_Soav&apos;e dolc&apos;ardore_[32]:</p><p>      (C#*)                       (F#*)      (G#*)<br/>  C*   Db    D*    Eb*  E*     F*  Gb         Ab     A*    Bb*  B*<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    C#           Eb              F#         G#           Bb<br/>C          D          E      F          G          A          B      C</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s first part of his madrigal _Dolce mio ben_ from the same<br/>treatise, and also some of his four-voice examples of enharmonic<br/>cadences, may be accommodated with an Ab-C#/Ab*-Db tuning[33]:</p><p>      (C#*)                       (F#*)<br/>  C*   Db    D*    Eb*  E*     F*  Gb           Ab*  A*    Bb*  B*<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    C#           Eb              F#           Ab         Bb<br/>C          D          E      F          G          A          B      C</p><p>This tuning, like the standard one, invites a perfectly symmetrical<br/>arrangement of the two keyboards. In this respect, our third tuning<br/>presents a bit of a dilemma.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s complete Latin secular motet _Musica prisca caput_, and<br/>also his first part of the madrigal _Madonna, il poco dolce_, call for<br/>a Bb-D#/Ab*-Db tuning[34]. Mapping this to another purely symmetrical<br/>arrangement, we would have:</p><p>      (C#*)     (D#*)             (F#*)<br/>  C*   Db    D*  Eb     E*     F*  Gb           Ab*  A*    Bb*  B*<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    C#         D#                F#           Ab         Bb<br/>C          D          E      F          G          A          B      C</p><p>While this mapping is quite practice, it presents the curious<br/>situation where D# appears as a &quot;usual&quot; note on the lower keyboard,<br/>and Eb as an &quot;unusual&quot; note on the upper keyboard. If we wish to<br/>follow the convention of treating Eb as usual and D# as unusual, as on<br/>Vicentino&apos;s keyboard, then a slight break in symmetry is required:</p><p>      (C#*)                       (F#*)<br/>  C*   Db    D* D#      E*     F*  Gb           Ab*  A*    Bb*  B*<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    C#           Eb              F#           Ab         Bb<br/>C          D          E      F          G          A          B      C</p><p>For a harpsichord, one advantage of this arrangement is that it makes<br/>it possible to move from Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab to Bb-D#/Bb*-Eb by retuning only<br/>a single note per octave: changing Eb* on the upper manual to D# at<br/>the opposite extreme of the 24-note chain of fifths. On a digital<br/>instrument where the retuning is accomplished by tables, the choice<br/>may be more of a matter of pure taste.</p><p>If retuning between pieces is inconvenient or impractical, then an<br/>alternative would be to transpose where necessary into our standard<br/>range of Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab. Pieces calling for a range of Ab-C#/Ab*-Db<br/>could be transposed up a fifth or down a fourth, and pieces calling<br/>for Bb-D#/Bb*-Eb likewise transposed up a fourth or down a fifth.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
