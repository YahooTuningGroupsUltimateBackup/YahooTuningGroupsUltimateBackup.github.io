Is the chord on the downbeat (f3-h3-d#4-g#4) a proper entity?<br/>Does the ascent of the top line from g#4 to a4 on the last eighth of the<br/>measure constitute a resolution, a new harmony, or is it just a passing tone<br/>towards the dominant seven of the next measure?   While functionalists in<br/>the Riemannian tradition (tuning scholar Martin Vogel, who wrote an entire<br/>volume on the &quot;Tristanakkord&quot; comes from this tradition) continue to debate<br/>the proper label for the chord, the majority of scholars probably share the<br/>notion that what we&apos;re hearing is not so-much a function chordal entity, but<br/>a byproduct of voice leading. In any case, the vertical combination on the<br/>downbeat of the second full measure of T&amp;I is a combination that maps very<br/>closely onto an inversion of either the harmonic 5:6:7:9 or the subharmonic<br/>/7:/6:/5:/4. Naturally, I was curious to hear which mapping was the better<br/>fit, especially since the technology to make the comparison is now readily<br/>available.</p><p>Since you might like to duplicate this at home, I&apos;ve posted a brief midi<br/>file of the pickup note and first three measures from _Tristan_ to the<br/>tuning list web page.  I tuned the chord (using WAVMaker to produces WAVs in<br/>very accurate tuning)as 5:7:9:12, as /7:/5:/4:/3, and in 12tet, using sines,<br/>sampled orchestral instruments, and a harmonium-like timbre of my own<br/>device.</p><p>I was surprised by the result. I found that the sampled instruments<br/>introduced so much irregularity that it was impossible to compare the<br/>results, while sine waves and the harmonium timbre definitely favored the<br/>two just intonations. The character of the harmonic and subharmonic chords<br/>were equally interesting (the harmonic was &quot;spectral&quot; in character, with a<br/>akin to using a sweeping band pass filter, the subharmonic was formant-like<br/>with the presence of the common overtone).  It&apos;s basically a toss-up, but I<br/>did, however, find that I liked the _melodic_ intervals of the suharmonic<br/>version someone better.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest</p></div><h3><a id=18236 href="#18236">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

However, in a voicing like G#3-B3-D#4-F4, I find 10:12:15:17 to be<br/>the tuning to which the 12-tET version seems to &quot;imply&quot; -- that is,<br/>10:12:15:17 sounds like a &quot;cleaned-up&quot; version of the 12-tET tuning, while<br/>6:7:9:10 and 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7 both sound &quot;xenharmonic&quot; to me.</p></div>
