It<br/>only comes up when you search the <a href="http://2.9.7.11">2.9.7.11</a> subgroup - see here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.9.7.11&error=5.0">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.9.7.11&error=5.0</a></p><p>But not if you search for <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a>:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.7.9.11&error=5.0">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.7.9.11&error=5.0</a></p><p>The same thing happens if you search 2.5.3 instead of 2.3.5:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.5.3&error=5.0">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.5.3&error=5.0</a></p><p>I suggest it might be useful, when a search is conducted, to<br/>internally place the incoming limit into some sort of normal form, so<br/>that <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> and <a href="http://2.9.7.11">2.9.7.11</a> become equivalent. Placing the numbers in<br/>ascending order would probably do the trick. Otherwise it&apos;s going to<br/>get hairy when searching subgroups.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2011 12:00:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I suggest it might be useful, when a search is conducted,<br/>&gt; to internally place the incoming limit into some sort of<br/>&gt; normal form, so that <a href="http://2.7.9.11">2.7.9.11</a> and <a href="http://2.9.7.11">2.9.7.11</a> become<br/>&gt; equivalent.

The normal list makes it <a href="http://2.9.7.11">2.9.7.11</a>, and I suggest we stick to that or we won&apos;t know what to do with more exotic subgroups.</p></div>
