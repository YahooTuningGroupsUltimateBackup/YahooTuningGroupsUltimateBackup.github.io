I, for one, would enjoy studying it that way, and I have heard<br/>that others print them out for similar purposes.</p><p>After all 1/1 is pretty inactive right now, and this tuning list is<br/>obviously VERY active, with lots of technical things that take some study,<br/>preferably OFF the computer screen.</p><p>Great idea...</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
