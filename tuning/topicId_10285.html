If Partch defines &quot;otonal/utonal&quot; as a relationship between<br/>sonorities which cannot be obtained from each other by Rameau&apos;s<br/>process of inversion (octave transposition of voices), then indeed<br/>this concept does _not_ properly apply to 3-limit trines.</p><p>Accordingly, respecting Partch&apos;s premises and definitions, I would<br/>amend my original position to say that the contrast between the two<br/>&quot;flavors&quot; of trines I describe may be in some ways musically<br/>_analogous_ to that reflected by the &quot;otonal/utonal&quot; concept with<br/>which I am familiar mainly from discussions on this list.</p><p>At the same time, Carl, I would like to thank you for sharing your own<br/>musical perceptions and helping me to validate my own feeling that the<br/>contrast between the two basic flavors of 3-limit trines and 5-limit<br/>triads are indeed analogous.</p><p>Rather than using the &quot;otonal/utonal&quot; concept where Paul has taught me<br/>it does not properly apply, I might better present an analysis using<br/>the terms and concepts of medieval and Renaissance theory, the basis<br/>of much of my own outlook. This process may require a number of posts,<br/>somewhat technical but I hope also readable.</p><p>Here I would like mainly to answer a few of Paul&apos;s questions about<br/>matters of musical feeling. The question of artistic perceptions and<br/>motivations may be at least as important as the mathematical logic of<br/>a given approach to theory, and may thus be an ideal place to start.</p><p>First, I would say that in a Gothic setting, a 3-limit trine with<br/>octave, fifth, and fourth sounds indeed more &quot;complete&quot; to me than a<br/>simple fifth or fourth -- rather like a 5-limit triad is more<br/>&quot;complete&quot; than a simple major or minor third. A medieval theorist<br/>such as Johannes de Grocheio (1300) likewise says that _three_ voices<br/>are required in order to &quot;perfect a consonance&quot; -- that is, to achieve<br/>full saturation by sounding the musical &quot;Trinity&quot; of the octave,<br/>fifth, and fourth simultaneously.</p><p>Further, I would say that a simple fifth has a flavor musically akin<br/>to that of a complete trine with the fifth placed below and the fourth<br/>above; and a simple fourth to the converse arrangement with the fourth<br/>below and fifth above. This is analogous to the kinship of the simple<br/>major third to a triad with the major third below and the minor third<br/>above; and conversely for the simple minor third.</p><p>Using my notation for three-note/interval sonorities where the<br/>intervals are shown as (outer|lower + upper), these affinities might<br/>be shown as follows, with examples of trines and triads given in MIDI<br/>notation where C4 indicates middle C:</p><p>   Limit         Simple interval            Kindred trinic/triadic flavor<br/>   -----         ---------------            -----------------------------</p><p>     3                  5                   (8|5 + 4), e.g. D3-A3-D4<br/>     3                  4                   (8|4 + 5), e.g. D3-G3-D4</p><p>     5                 M3                   (5|M3 + m3), e.g. G3-B3-D4<br/>     5                 m3                   (5|m3 + M3), e.g. G3-Bb3-D4</p><p>Note that a complete 3-limit trine includes two richly stable 3-limit<br/>intervals of a similar but distinct quality, the fifth and fourth,<br/>plus an interval from the next lower limit, the 2-limit octave.<br/>Similarly, the complete 5-limit triad includes two similar but<br/>distinct 5-limit intervals, the major and minor third, plus an<br/>interval from the next lower limit, the 3-limit fifth.</p><p>In either 3-limit or 5-limit music, I would make a distinction between<br/>a &quot;simple&quot; two-voice interval and a &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;open&quot; one. A fifth or<br/>fourth in 3-limit (trinic) music, and likewise a major or minor third<br/>in 5-limit music, represents a richly stable interval. Thus I would<br/>call such an interval &quot;simple&quot; (in comparison to a complete trine or<br/>triad), but not &quot;open&quot; or &quot;bare.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, from a musical as well as logical point of view, I might<br/>indeed speak of a &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;open&quot; octave in trinic music, and<br/>likewise of a &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;open&quot; fifth in triadic music -- respectively<br/>a 2-limit interval in a 3-limit setting, or a 3-limit interval in a<br/>5-limit setting. As the term &quot;open&quot; may suggest, in either case such<br/>an interval seems to invite the addition of a third middle voice<br/>dividing it into the richly euphonious fifth and fourth of a complete<br/>trine, or major and minor third of a complete triad.</p><p>From a psychological point of view, I suspect that the 2-limit octave<br/>may serve as an integral interval of a 3-limit trine because it is<br/>only one step below the limit of saturation; thus it has a greater<br/>sonorous impact than when added to a 5-limit triad, where it is two<br/>steps removed from the limit of saturation.</p><p>Terminology and math aside, the importance of the octave in a complete<br/>trine really hit me when I heard a performance of one of Perotin&apos;s<br/>three-voice organa on an album called _Vox humana_. To open the piece,<br/>the ensemble played first the lowest voice alone, then added the<br/>second voice at the fifth -- and only after allowing some time to<br/>appreciate this process did they finally add the third voice at the<br/>octave, triumphantly completing the trine! The richness and resonance<br/>was transcendent.</p><p>Thus in trinic music I regard the octave as an integral interval not<br/>only because it fits medieval theory and has mathematical attractions,<br/>but because it concords with my musical experience. In 5-limit or<br/>higher music, treating the octave as more of a mere &quot;doubling&quot; or<br/>&quot;replication&quot; may reflect its lesser perceived sonorousness vis-a-vis<br/>a unison as the texture becomes more dense, the norm of stable<br/>saturation more complex.</p><p>Indeed, such differences should caution us that analogies are just<br/>that, as opposed to equations: 3-limit and 5-limit musics are<br/>different systems, and one can focus on either the differences or the<br/>similarities.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2000 10:28:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Ultimately, I have to agree with Margo, and the psychoacoustical explanation<br/>&gt;cannot be found in the concepts of roughness or tonalness. There appears to<br/>&gt;be an additional phenomenon, &quot;rootedness&quot;, which gives the lowest sounding<br/>&gt;note an extra probabilistic boost in its likelihood of being interpreted as<br/>&gt;octave-equivalent to the fundamental. This would explain why, for example,<br/>&gt;4:5:6 is more &quot;consonant&quot; than 3:4:5.</p><p>Are we sure that 4:5:6 will not have higher tonalness than 3:4:5, when<br/>triadic harmonic entropy appears?</p><p>Further, since tonalness is defined as a measure of the &quot;clarity&quot; of the fundamental, should rootedness be a new concept, or should our tonalness<br/>metric include a fix for this phenomenon (the fundamental is more clearly<br/>resolved when the lowest note sounding is octave-equivalent to it)?</p><p>Lastly, would removing all factors of 2 from a chord, except those<br/>which preserve the ordering of its identities (leaving the factors<br/>whose removal would invert the chord) before performing tonalness<br/>measurements be a workable fix?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2000 7:58:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Lastly, would removing all factors of 2 from a chord, except those<br/>&gt;&gt;which preserve the ordering of its identities (leaving the factors<br/>&gt;&gt;whose removal would invert the chord) before performing tonalness<br/>&gt;&gt;measurements be a workable fix?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ugly.</p><p>Agree, but if you want it separate from tonalness, I fear it&apos;s going<br/>to be ugly.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
