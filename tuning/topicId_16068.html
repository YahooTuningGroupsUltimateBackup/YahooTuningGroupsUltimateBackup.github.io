I swear to you, though, that before you put in the debug<br/>&gt; code the beta crashed EVERY TIME!  And with TWO DIFFERENT<br/>&gt; installations from scratch!!</p><p>I can believe that. Adding code can change the way the stack is organised,<br/>and so affect the program, especially in the c programming language. Certain<br/>types of bug get switched on / off depending on how the stack is organised.</p><p>I could even have accidentally fixed the bug while putting in the debug code<br/>(needed a little bit of editing), can happen, and then we&apos;ll never know what it was.</p><p>&gt; Is that really worth it??  With the box unchecked it really doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; affect much, as you say...  Except now it doesn&apos;t crash!</p><p>Well, perhaps I&apos;m a bit of a perfectionist as regards crashes - I don&apos;t<br/>want it to do it ever!</p><p>But if I get no more reports of it happening, reckon can call it fixed.</p><p>So reckon, I can leave it like that. Plus won&apos;t do any harm to go through<br/>that section of the code thoroughly again - the more polished it is the better.</p><p>(unless of course you do have to tick the debug box to get it to run -<br/>that isn&apos;t a workable solution because it slows it down a _lot_)</p><p>If anyone can get FTS to crash at all, I will very much appreciate a<br/>report, whether it is reproducible or not, - see the download page.</p><p>I&apos;ve added a new section on reporting crashes, with the new debug<br/>tick box explained.</p><p>Just done new upload of the beta with a few extras, including the option<br/>to make the new candidate hyper-MOS scales.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
