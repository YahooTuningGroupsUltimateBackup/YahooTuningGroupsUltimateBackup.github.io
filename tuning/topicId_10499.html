Anyone see any similarities to any recorded historical tuning?<br/>I would guess, from this result, that the piece (which is in F) has no G#s,<br/>but has both C#s and Dbs, with C#s predominating. Anyone have access to<br/>Mozart&apos;s original notation of this piece?</p><p>I would also surmise that Ab-Eb and G-D occur quite rarely as<br/>simultaneities, with B-F# somewhat rare too and Eb-Bb and D-A uncommon as<br/>well. Meanwhile, all major thirds from Ab-C through D-F# are all quite pure,<br/>except Bb-D @393&cent; and Eb-G <a href="https://twitter.com/395">@395</a>.5&cent; (these major thirds must appear less<br/>often in the harmonies of the piece).</p><p>The benefit over a straight meantone is quite tangible in the increased<br/>purity of the more-used fifths.</p></div><h3><a id=10528 href="#10528">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Some numbers:</p><p>&gt;   5-limit COFT                    94059.211</p><p>&gt;   12-tET                         262051.252</p><p>&gt;   31-tET subset: Db thru F#      167045.100</p><p>&gt;   31-tET subset: Ab thru C#      133869.159</p><p>&gt;   31-tET subset: Eb thru G#      207664.471</p><p>&gt;   31-tET subset: Bb thru D#      259414.234</p><p>Clearly, the COFT wins here because it compromises the tuning of note 2<br/>between C# and Db. What would be interesting is if you could distinguish the<br/>D-flats from the C-sharps and use a 13-tone, rather than 12-tone, subset of<br/>31-tET. That might come out better than a 12-tone COFT, but it might not,<br/>since a subset 31-tET still fails to distinguish between the much-used and<br/>little-used fifths (not counting the wolf). Of course, a 13-tone COFT would<br/>do better than either, and might be so smooth-sounding that a subsequent<br/>adaptive relaxation might not even result in an audible improvement.</p></div>
