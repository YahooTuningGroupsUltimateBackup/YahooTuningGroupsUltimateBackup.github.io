So i began tweaking scales that were all<br/>based on 1 particular interval with their only &quot;relationship&quot;  being usually<br/>a seventeeness, attempting to expand the implied 7 limit it hindoo music to<br/>the prime 17 -- i was deep in Pythag world using the Holy tetrakys -10 and<br/>adding 7 and believing that Shankar&apos;s SA was indeed a 17/16.<br/>Recently as in the piece David and I debuted @ AFMM (sans echoes) we used a<br/>&quot;mixed JI&quot; scale that did not adhere to one particular limit in what some<br/>would call &quot;Advanced Just Intonation&quot; or a tuning not easily definable to<br/>beginners...but obviously you folks on this list know your tunings. We<br/>wanted (<a href="https://twitter.com/AFMM">@AFMM</a>) a tuning that would function not simply as a tuning but as a<br/>score with certain members of the scale pre-designated as (Functions) where<br/>something would happen in the hallways of the structure -Ataraxya- a term<br/>revived by Beardsley in regards to our Collaboration. <a href="https://twitter.com/afmm">@afmm</a> we explored<br/>neutral 17(ness) even though our gorgeous chords were occult due to tech<br/>probs....<br/>......three years later- the phone rings.....<br/>he called to say<br/>&quot;the performance is finished&quot;</p><p>I hope that we will get the opportunity to play a piece or two in England<br/>this coming year, dear Lawrence.<br/>It would be a joy to play a few shows with you across the pond.<br/>blessings and check that mail!</p><p>Pat Pagano, Director<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/><a href="http://indians.australians.com/meherbaba/">http://indians.australians.com/meherbaba/</a><br/><a href="http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/">http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/</a><br/>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: Lawrence Ball &lt;<a href="mailto:Lawrenceball@planettree.demon.co.uk">Lawrenceball@planettree.demon.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>To: tuning &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, February 28, 2001 7:36 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] 1/1 17/16 425/384 153/128 51/40 1377/1024 17/12 119/80<br/>51/32 17/10 85/48 119/64 2/1</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;

related.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;ve used 3s 5s 7s &amp; 17s as factors in the generative process -<br/>sometimes<br/>&gt; very high numbers - these seem to me to be the outcome of chains of fifths<br/>&gt; or in one case two thirds, over and above the 17/16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 425 = 17 x 5 x 5<br/>&gt; 153 = 17 x 3 x 3<br/>&gt; 119 = 7 x 17<br/>&gt; 1377 = 17 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3<br/>&gt; 85 = 5 x 17<br/>&gt; 51 = 3 x 17<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just a few arithmetical reflections<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact to illustrate my point about the intervals relating most directly<br/>to<br/>&gt; the 17/16, here&apos;s the tuning measured in relation to the 17/16 pitch:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

in rel to the original 153/28:<br/>&gt; the 17/12 is a 7/6<br/>&gt; the 51/32 is a 4/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I were designing a scale in response to yours, I might look at some<br/>&gt; multiples of lower primes in relation to the tonic as well as to the<br/>17:16.<br/>&gt; That way the tonic might feel a bit happier, having a few friends to whom<br/>it<br/>&gt; might relate more directly - otherwise the 17 guys might get a bit cliquey<br/>&gt; ......who knows, and then there will only be one 17 ratio left (the<br/>32/17).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;

variation..........<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Its amazing there are 66 relationships between 2 notes, 220 between 3<br/>notes<br/>&gt; ......(in a &quot;12&quot; tuning that is), so many interrelationships, (knew it for<br/>a<br/>&gt; million years but I just started thinking about it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   LaMonte Young uses only chains of 3:2 and 7:4 in The Well-Tuned Piano as<br/>&gt; generator intervals, so that each note is either a chain of fifths or a<br/>&gt;
