And, of<br/>&gt;course, those sorts of concepts make me wonder, where ARE those sounds<br/>&gt;in the Universe?

That theory and reality are often not the same thing in<br/>&gt;music..just as an equal temperament is a representation of pure<br/>&gt;pitches, not the actually perfect tones, so music that speaks of using<br/>&gt;those really high harmonics is not really using those actual<br/>&gt;harmonics..they cannot be heard, as far as I know, by human beings.
