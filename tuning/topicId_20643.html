He, too, may have liked a pleasant surprise<br/>now and then. If you can access a copy of an old (probably &apos;50&apos;s)<br/>Red Seal recording of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, listen to that strawberry<br/>woman. This recording has it! And whatever the notation (and its<br/>expected rendition), I&apos;m quite sure this is what GG wanted to<br/>emulate.</p><p>klaus</p><p>&quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; schrieb:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Graham wrote:]<br/>&gt; &gt;I don&apos;t know about Gershwin&apos;s ideas, but his music seems to work with<br/>&gt; &gt;12-equal.

The JI references seem<br/>&gt;otherworldly is contrast.</p><p>Oh absolutely septimal JI and higher limits do sound otherworldly but in my<br/>opinion they are superior to 12 tet for blues music.</p><p>What I was refering to was a special form of Just Intonation that was devised<br/>through the research of Paul C. Boomsliter and Warren Creel in the 1960&apos;s.<br/>They basically realised that there was no comparable theory for melody in<br/>western music as there was for harmony. So they set out to find out what pitches<br/>musicians used for melody.</p><p>To begin with they used a sort of monochord with a slide and asked test subjects<br/>to select pitches for a bunch of different melodies. They would always recheck<br/>the subjects choice of pitch showing alternative pitches to make absolutely<br/>certain that this was the pitch the subject found most pleasing.</p><p>When they had interpreted the data they found that subjects would neither use<br/>classical just intonation [1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8] nor 12tet nor<br/>pythagorean intonation.They assembled the pitches the subjects used into 3<br/>referential keyboards.</p><p>What they found was that subjects chose intonations that were in small whole<br/>number ratios to a unsounded [phantom ?] reference. This reference would change<br/>as the music progressed travelling through a set of linkages. These linkages<br/>fell into 3 categories major, minor and blue.      With the major chain of<br/>references there are a succession of 3:2&apos;s. The small whole number ratios that<br/>were related to these links are 1/1, 9/8, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5,<br/>5/3, 7/4 &amp; 9/5. These ratios are transposed into five tiers based on the<br/>reference of the keyboard.</p><p>The minor keyboard is similar to the major keyboard except the second tier is<br/>transposed by 6:5 and then by successive 3:2&apos;s. The blue keyboard initially is<br/>transposed by 5:4 and then by a chain of 3:2&apos;s.</p><p>This keyboard should not be thought of as merely modulations of a set of just<br/>interval as the each tier is NOT treated individually pitches from differnt<br/>ranks are played in succession.</p><p>Anyway I have been able to use this method effectively using Justonic&apos;s Pitch<br/>Palette software to manually change keys as I am playing to achieve the most<br/>satisfactory intonation for my melodies.</p><p>Another untapped area in this regard  is the use of 11 and 13 limit ratios in an<br/>extended reference scheme for melody.</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p></div>
