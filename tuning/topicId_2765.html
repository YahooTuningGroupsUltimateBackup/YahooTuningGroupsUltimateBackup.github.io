I state<br/>my views as a compensation to assumptions I see being made. Hear on this list I am aware that I arrived<br/>from a completely different direction that most. Being the case it could quite possibly be the wrong forum<br/>for my ideas, especially if the environment is such that despite its pretext is predominantly focused on<br/>ETs, non acoustic music derived predominantly for western musical assumptions (with a few exceptions).<br/>Just as those who participate in the above worthwhile practices have their philosophical background on<br/>which a host of others idea gravitate, it would seem logical that an opposite musical practice would be a<br/>gravity to other ways of seeing. Frankly a while back I listed Why I preferred JI over ET. I expected to<br/>get a list back. ( i had even thought of a few myself) My observations were not a conclusions that they<br/>were universal!<br/> BTW I heard and maybe this needs to be corrected  that Ravi Shankar was turned down for teaching job at<br/>UCSD because they said they considered him an &quot;untrained&quot; musician.
