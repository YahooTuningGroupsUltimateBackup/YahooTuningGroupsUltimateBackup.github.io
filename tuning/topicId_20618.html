I hope it works out.  Another scenario would be a<br/>&gt; CD-ROM or such like that we could purchase at cost and have sent to<br/>&gt; us... but if all of this can be done &quot;on line&quot; so much the better.</p><p>&gt; I know for myself I would like to have a personal access to the<br/>&gt; entire archive for safekeeping, and I assume there are many others<br/>&gt; who feel similarly.</p><p>I&apos;ll see what the Yahoo engineers say. The emergency<br/>cord idea gives us a starting point which we could build on if not<br/>sufficient as it is.</p><p>If anyone wants to make cds of the archive when finished that&apos;s fine.</p><p>Only 7000 messages left to download now. Then have to decide<br/>how exactly to organise such a large index, and it may possibly need<br/>some work on the sorting to make it more efficient - at present<br/>uses the windows combos with re-draw switched off, which is okay<br/>if the combos have up to a thousand or so entries, but gets slow<br/>eventually.</p><p>Speak up soon if anyone has a point of view on this that we<br/>haven&apos;t heard yet!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
