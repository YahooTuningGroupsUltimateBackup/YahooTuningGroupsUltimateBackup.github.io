Soloists Michael<br/>Lowenstern, clarinet, Curtis Macomber, violin, Elizabeth Farnum,<br/>soprano, Paul Hostetter, conductor.</p><p>I expected a curiosity.  The general word is that the composer<br/>Giacinto Scelsi is an obsessed mystic, repeating single notes ad<br/>infinitum in a peculiar, but expressive minimalism.  However, the<br/>pieces presented by Sequitur, in collaboration with George Steel&apos;s<br/>Miller Theatre, showed a much broader portrait, one informed by<br/>currents of traditional European contemporary music.  Yes, it is true<br/>that Scelsi was a bit, er, &quot;peculiar.&quot;  He didn&apos;t, in later years,<br/>want to be called a composer, but instead a &quot;messenger&quot; or &quot;medium&quot;<br/>receiving sounds fromÂ… well, don&apos;t ask.</p><p>Additionally, there is good evidence that he didn&apos;t write down some<br/>of his own works. Maybe he didn&apos;t have the traditional technique for<br/>that?  Instead, he recorded his improvisations and visions on tape<br/>and he would hire amanuenses to notate the scores for him.  (In an<br/>interesting twist of fate, some of these composer-assistants have<br/>come forward later, as Scelsi became famous, claming they were the<br/>real &quot;authors.&quot;)</p><p>So, there is little question why this composer, a wealthy count, was<br/>viewed in his lifetime as a musical dilettante.  Almost all of<br/>Scelsi&apos;s &quot;mature&quot; works have peculiar titles.  Nobody seems to know<br/>what they mean. Nor is there information on the Internet, aside from<br/>the explanation that they are allusions to obscure Asian mythology.</p><p>Scelsi, like many composers, had several different phases of his<br/>work. These included a brief flirtation with serialism.  However, the<br/>love affair soon soured and he had a nervous breakdown, caused, some<br/>say, by his rejection of serialism&apos;s rigid control.  His therapy<br/>consisted of playing a single note over and over on the piano,<br/>listening to fine gradations of tone and dynamic. These revelations<br/>led to his original and novel views of music, in addition to, most<br/>probably, oblique stares by the nurses at the institution where he<br/>was recovering.</p><p>He became a dedicated microtonalist, eschewing, in later years, the<br/>use of the pitch-limited piano.  In the works presented by Sequitur<br/>from his later, original style, one of the primary elements is<br/>microtonal alteration of pitch.  Ignoring, for the moment, the<br/>question of provenance, let&apos;s examine some of the more exciting works<br/>on this program, all from his third phase, regardless of how they<br/>were written or, even, &quot;channeled&quot;:</p><p>I found the most striking work on the program Okanagon from 1968, in<br/>several senses.  Scored for harp, tam-tam and doublebass, it includes<br/>the use of small metal rods to touch both the tam-tam and harp<br/>strings after they are struck.  This leads to a peculiar buzzing<br/>noise that adds an unusual contrast to the low sounds of the gong and<br/>an almost continuous bowing of the doublebass.  There are rests,<br/>however, between strikes of the tam-tam and, curiously enough,<br/>frequently it sounds as though the bass is alternating between the<br/>tonic and dominant.  I&apos;ve never heard music quite like this.</p><p>There were somewhat more traditional pieces as well, such as Khoom,<br/>(1962) for soprano, horn, percussionists and strings.  The wonderful<br/>soprano Elizabeth Farnum  navigated the detailed peculiarities of<br/>this score with authority and, after the concert, explained to me<br/>that practically every note of the Scelsi score had some particular<br/>articulation or microtonal inflection.  In addition, Ms. Farnum<br/>informed me that Scelsi invented the sung text from sound-syllables<br/>with no discrete words from Asian languages.</p><p>The second and third &quot;episode&quot; (of seven) in Khoom involves a<br/>soloistic setting for soprano and bongo-like percussion and soprano<br/>and horn, respectively, giving a contrast to the episodes for full<br/>ensemble.  One of the more arresting is episode five, which sounds a<br/>bit like some of the more energetic moments of the composer George<br/>Crumb.  Unlike a Crumb imitator, however, it was clear that Scelsi is<br/>reflecting the same original Asian musical influences as heard in<br/>Crumb&apos;s music, approaching them from a slightly different angle.</p><p>Curtis Macomber, violinist extrordinaire and new music enthusiast,<br/>led the final and most impressive ensemble work of the evening,<br/>Anahit (1965), essentially a mini violin concerto.  This piece is<br/>scored for mixed ensemble of eighteen but there is a preponderance of<br/>string writing of a microtonal nature.  The solo violin strings are<br/>retuned to G-G-B-D presenting an exceptional challenge to Mr.<br/>Macomber, who seemed unfazed.   One of the salient features of this<br/>concertante-style work is a microtonal leading by the solo violin,<br/>followed by similar microtonal inflections in the ensemble.  At the<br/>same time, there are many tonal moments, some of the piece being in a<br/>kind of strange G major.</p><p>A composer to remember, Scelsi is neither a minimalist, maximalist,<br/>European, Asian, tonal or atonal composer, yet he is all of the<br/>above.  His microtonally inflected visions are entirely his own, and<br/>spring from a deep source which he was obsessively investigating.<br/>Even if he needed a little help along the way in realizing the sounds<br/>he heard, the fact that he found something new counts more than<br/>anything for Count Scelsi.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson c 2004</p></div>
