There is certainly some<br/>disagreement that I have with his interpretations, and which I will<br/>eventually address on the List.  But for now, what is important, is that he<br/>asserts that Werckmeister remained in favor of his own tuning and against<br/>equal temperament.  This is contrary to the Isacoff &quot;thesis.&quot;</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
