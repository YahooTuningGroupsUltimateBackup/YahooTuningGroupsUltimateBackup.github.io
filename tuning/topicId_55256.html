I know some people who could make an<br/>overtone flute for me (I mean the one with no finger holes). But before I<br/>can tell them what to do, I have to make a few calculations. And this is<br/>what I&apos;m not sure about.<br/>I&apos;ve been playing this instrument for nearly a year. I always thought that<br/>closing the opposite end of the flute shifts the overtones down by 1/2 of<br/>the fundamental frequency (for example, with the open end there is 200Hz,<br/>400Hz, 600, 800, 1000, etc. so I thought that with the closed end there<br/>should have been 100, 300, 500 700, 900, etc.). That would mean that a<br/>regular part of the overtone series could be achieved by playing the<br/>closed-end and the open-end overtones alternately. But when I compared these<br/>with a software-generated overtone series, I discovered that the closed-end<br/>overtones were a bit higher than they should actually be. I&apos;ve seen more<br/>overtone flutes and all of them had this problem. On some of them it was a<br/>pitch-shift of about 10 cents, but on others it was 30 cents or even more.<br/>Now I&apos;m a bit confused. Is it really impossible to make such a flute which<br/>makes a regular part of the overtone series if playing the closed-end and<br/>the open-end overtones alternately? And if not, what can be done for at<br/>least minimizing the error?<br/>Thanks to anyone&apos;s suggestions.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3>Jacob &#x3C;jbarton@rice.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2004 12:49:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&oslash;&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been playing this instrument for nearly a year.
