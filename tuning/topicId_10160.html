As a component of consonance, the ease with &gt;which the ear/brain system can resolve the fundamental is known as &gt;&quot;tonalness.&quot; I have proposed a concept called &quot;relative harmonic &gt;entropy&quot; to model  this component of dissonance.</p><p>This part of the article is quite clear to me and VERY interesting...<br/>After just re-reading Helmholz... it seems like he is mostly concerned<br/>with &quot;roughness&quot; or &quot;beating&quot; causing dissonance... but doesn&apos;t really<br/>get involved with the way the brain tries to match intervals with the<br/>&quot;nearest&quot; lower ratios as determining &quot;tonalness...&quot;</p><p>&gt;For inharmonic timbres, Sethares can find a whole new set of intervals<br/>&gt;that have low roughness (= are consonant), but they don&apos;t have high &gt;tonalness, because they don&apos;t imply a fundamental.</p><p>This is exceptionally interesting... one could maybe base a &quot;whole new<br/>music&quot; on these materials...</p><p>&gt;For triads or higher-ads - the roughness of Otonal chords is the same as<br/>&gt;that of Utonal chords because they have the same intervals, but the &gt;tonalness of Otonal chords is much greater, because they imply a much &gt;simpler set of harmonics over a fundamental.</p><p>I find this quite peculiar... but now that I&apos;ve re-read Helmholz, I&apos;m<br/>going to go back and re-read Partch... and may have more to say about<br/>this...</p><p>&gt;The harmonic entropy is based on the concept that the critical band<br/>&gt;represents a certain &gt;degree of uncertainty in the perception of pitch</p><p>Personally, for what it&apos;s worth, I like the phrasing of this sentence...<br/>even though the &quot;particulars&quot; of the specifically-defined &quot;critical<br/>band&quot;<br/>might be questionable -- since it brings into play the idea of a<br/>continuous spectrum of pitches...</p><p>&gt;i.e., 301/200 will be heard as a mistuned 3/2.</p><p>Well, yup.  But what&apos;s more interesting, of course,  is when things get<br/>really complicated...</p><p>&gt;Mediants define the conceptual boundaries of the ratios and since &gt;simpler ratios are farther away from more complex ones and complex ones &gt;cluster together, there are more possible actual intervals (rational or &gt;otherwise) that can be conceived as simpler ones than for more complex &gt;ones.</p><p>Wazzat??  Here&apos;s where I start to get lost (it had to happen).  Is this<br/>because of the bell curve??</p><p>&gt;The simpler-integer ratios take up a lot of room, defined as the &gt;interval between the mediant below and the mediant above, in interval &gt;space, and so are associated with. large &quot;slices&quot; of the<br/>&gt;probability distribution, while the more complex ratios are more crowded<br/>&gt;and therefore are associated with smaller &quot;slices.&quot;</p><p>This is obviously associated with the previous paragraph, and since I<br/>didn&apos;t understand THAT one, the probability that I would understand THIS<br/>one is, indeed, low...</p><p>&gt;When the true interval is near a simple-integer ratio, there will be one<br/>&gt;large probability and many much smaller ones. When the true interval is<br/>&gt;far from any simple-integer ratios, many more complex ratios will all &gt;have roughly equal probabilities. The entropy function will come out &gt;quite small in the former case, and quite large in the latter case.</p><p>Using &quot;fuzzy logic,&quot; I&apos;m kind of understanding this... It is related to<br/>the whole idea of the complex ratios being &quot;clustered together&quot; which<br/>you, hopefully, will explain a bit more in layman&apos;s terms.  However,<br/>accepting that fact, the above paragraph certainly makes sense...<br/>although, admittedly I don&apos;t fully understand the math behind it...</p><p>&gt;The function is x*log(x).</p><p>&gt;In the case of 700 cents, 3/2 will have far more probabilty than any &gt;other ratio, and the harmonic entropy is nearly minimal.</p><p>&gt;In the case of 300 cents, 6/5 will have the largest probability in most<br/>&gt;cases, but 7/6, 13/11, and 19/16 will all have non-negligible amounts of &gt;probability, so the harmonic entropy is moderate.</p><p>&gt;In the case of 100 cents, 15/14, 16/15, 17/16, 18/17, 19/18, 20/19, and<br/>&gt;1/1 will all have significant probability, and the harmonic entropy is &gt;nearly maximal.</p><p>Well, this certainly came at the right time... since these examples are<br/>very clear, and make a lot of sense...</p><p>&gt;Also, there is some evidence that the ear-brain system adjusts its<br/>&gt;sampling rate according to &gt;the rate of harmonic change in the music.<br/>&gt;(Monz)</p><p>This is fascinating, and I&apos;d like to know more about it...</p><p>&gt;In other words, re: Farey series of order infinity - even if we could<br/>&gt;conceive of intervals as accurately as we want, we would still &gt;substitute simpler ratios for more complex ones, because<br/>&gt;of our perceptual limitations (= the bell curve doesn&apos;t change, no &gt;matter how high the order), &gt;and the fact that simpler ratios always &gt;take up more room than more complex ones, no matter &gt;how high the order &gt;in the Farey series</p><p>This is related to the other paragraphs...  I guess I&apos;m really not<br/>getting the &quot;more room&quot; concept... and it seems rather significant...<br/>Does it have something to do with the fact that lower ratios are<br/>actually LARGER intervals???  Or is this wrong. ...</p><p>Regarding the Partch discussion... it seems as though the Utonal chords<br/>and Otonal chords should really sound quite different...  Is this so?  I<br/>guess I really need to hear some examples for me to fully understand<br/>this...</p><p>Could someone possibly construct such synthesized examples??  Otherwise,<br/>I guess Dean Drummond would have to play something.</p><p>Thanks for all the help!</p><p>Joe<br/>___________ ______ ___ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=10177 href="#10177">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2000 11:17:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Regarding the Partch discussion... it seems as though the Utonal chords<br/>&gt;and Otonal chords should really sound quite different... Is this so?  I<br/>&gt;guess I really need to hear some examples for me to fully understand<br/>&gt;this...</p><p>Of course, the major and minor triads in 5-limit western music are otonal<br/>and utonal chords.  An interesting question is: what _are_ &quot;major&quot; and<br/>&quot;minor&quot;?</p><p>Can we define a &quot;major&quot; consonance as one with low roughness and high<br/>tonalness, and a &quot;minor&quot; consonance as one with low roughness and low<br/>tonalness?  Is the sound of minor an un-expectedly weak sense of root?<br/>If so, Partch&apos;s otonal = major, utonal = minor conjecture would be<br/>justified up to the 9- or 11-limit (and maybe higher for unsaturated<br/>chords), when the utonal chords become dissonant due to combination<br/>tone effects and/or very low tonalness.  My experiments with chord<br/>progressions in extended JI sound, to my ear, in support of this idea.</p><p>Or is the sound of minor simply somthing we take from our exposure to<br/>the diatonic scale?  Is it just a scalar effect that we carry over to our<br/>experience of bare harmonies?  Or perhaps the major/minor duality of<br/>music has no substantial basis at all -- maybe we create it in our music<br/>by features of composition, done by custom now, by total accident at<br/>first...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10200 href="#10200">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2000 11:05:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Clearly these words &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; are used to mean several different<br/>&gt;things, and I think trying to find a single underlying meaning for these<br/>&gt;words is an endeavor which is too oriented on linguistic accident and<br/>&gt;ultimately misses the point.</p><p>I see that I wasn&apos;t too clear.  It&apos;s obvious that these words can mean<br/>different things at different times, a combination of things at a given<br/>time, etc.  I was referring specifically to the (admittedly subjective)<br/>sound of otonal vs. utonal chords.  Do you feel that the difference in<br/>the sound between otonal and utonal 5-limit chords is similar to that<br/>between otonal and utonal 7-limit chords?  If not, then so be it.  But<br/>if so, isn&apos;t it possible that there is a teleological explanation?</p><p>&gt;I think Harry Partch&apos;s definition of &quot;tonality&quot; is the source of a lot<br/>&gt;of trouble. He speaks as if tonality was nothing more than one chord,<br/>&gt;the tonic chord.</p><p>Of course tonality can be more than this, but my post was about the<br/>experience of listening to bare chords only, so Partch&apos;s observations<br/>are relavent.</p><p>&gt;As you know, I (perhaps indoctrinated by contemporary theory :)) believe<br/>&gt;that tonality is founded, instead, on not only the tonicity of the tonic<br/>&gt;chord but also the resolving tendencies of the notes in the scale. While<br/>&gt;Partch might lead you to believe that the major-minor duality in Western<br/>&gt;music is nothing more than the Otonal-Utonal duality in the particular<br/>&gt;case of the 5-limit, the fact of the matter is that we had not two but<br/>&gt;six or seven equally viable modes in Western music, and it was only<br/>&gt;through the increasing use of dissonance in the Baroque period that the<br/>&gt;tritone achieved its pivotal role as the characteristic dissonance of the<br/>&gt;diatonic scale, and the resolving tendencies of the tritone reduced the<br/>&gt;number of viable modes to two: major and minor. The fact that this<br/>&gt;duality, by conicidence, appears parallel to the otonal-utonal duality,<br/>&gt;and that this parallelism is linguistically supported, may have misled<br/>&gt;Partch, and may be misleading you now.</p><p>Paul, re-read the first sentence of the last paragraph of my post.<br/>Remember that I was discussing only the experience of listening to bare<br/>chords.

I think that the consonance of utonal chords<br/>deteriorates rapidly with increasing limit, and so in the 5-limit,<br/>the<br/>utonal triad emerges as one of the most consonant triads in the<br/>diatonic scale (though still threatened by otonal interpretations<br/>like<br/>16:19:24 and even 6:7:9), while beyond the 9-limit, utonal chords<br/>just<br/>sound &quot;wrong&quot; to me. I like Kyle Gann&apos;s use of a tuning which<br/>provides<br/>9-limit utonalities and 11-limit otonalities; he&apos;s breaking Partch&apos;s<br/>symmetry, no doubt influenced by the lack of psychoacoustical<br/>symmetry<br/>between otonal and utonal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10210 href="#10210">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2000 6:22:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I think otonal/utonal pairs sound more and more different the higher<br/>&gt;the limit (in the 3-limit they&apos;re the same),</p><p>I agree.
