Tuning<br/>&gt; forum by George, who&apos;s writing a book on tuning. The quotes left in are by<br/>&gt; me, Pauline. This post, which I also sent to my JI forum, and to George, is<br/>&gt; more technical than what is usually posted in my organ forum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But one member asked for more JI info a while back. What George says is so<br/>&gt; close to my own thinking and experiments on the JT organ I&apos;m building, I<br/>&gt; asked his permission to post some of what he said in my music forums. He<br/>&gt; agreed. His eMail address is: &lt;A <a href="mailto:HREF="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">HREF="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a>&lt;/A&gt; .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pauline<br/>&gt; ______________________<br/>&gt; George:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, if you can count them, it&apos;s tempered. (If you&apos;re doing it by<br/>&gt; ear, then you set a temperament by counting beats, right?) However,<br/>&gt; if they&apos;re so slow that it&apos;s difficult to count them, then it&apos;s just.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that no beating sounds stagnant or dead, but very slow<br/>&gt; beating is like letting in a bit of fresh air. Microtempering a JI<br/>&gt; set can accomplish this, while making consonances out of some near-<br/>&gt; misses. (My upper limit is about 3.25 cents error for most<br/>&gt; intervals, but half of that for 2:3&apos;s. And 217-ET does considerably<br/>&gt; better than that.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I first investigated alternative tuning systems in 1963, one of<br/>&gt; the things I did was to retune my electronic organ to the meantone<br/>&gt; temperament, which is practically the same thing as a subset of 31-<br/>&gt; ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I kept the organ tuned this way for several weeks and was absolutely<br/>&gt; delighted with the way older organ music (such as Bach and Handel)<br/>&gt; sounded, as long as I didn&apos;t try to make enharmonic substitutions (in<br/>&gt; order to avoid the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth).  Particularly intriguing was the<br/>&gt; fact that augmented seconds and diminished sevenths sounded different<br/>&gt; from (i.e., more dissonant than) minor thirds and major sixths,<br/>&gt; something that we don&apos;t have with 12-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I did miss the ability to modulate freely, and so I put the organ<br/>&gt; back into 12-ET.  I was totally unprepared for the shock that I<br/>&gt; received when, after playing no more than two or three chords, I<br/>&gt; found my ears literally assaulted by dissonant triads that would find<br/>&gt; no resolution or rest until, in desperation, I omitted the third of<br/>&gt; the chord, leaving an open fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In meantone I could easily flee the wolf by playing in another key, but in<br/>&gt; 12-ET there was no escape.  Not only did the thirds and sixths have a<br/>&gt; jarring effect,<br/>&gt; but everything sounded out of tune.  It suddenly became obvious to me<br/>&gt; why organs were not generally tuned in equal temperament in England<br/>&gt; until after 1850; if I found the change hard to accept after only a<br/>&gt; few weeks in meantone, how difficult it must have been for those who<br/>&gt; had spent all their lives with it to put up with 12-ET, in which you<br/>&gt; have three times the error in the major and minor triads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The out-of-tune sensation of equal temperament left me after a short<br/>&gt; while, but I have never been satisfied with its unending dissonance<br/>&gt; since that time.  I soon solved the problem by devising a well-<br/>&gt; temperament that would give me more consonant-sounding triads in at<br/>&gt; least a few keys, until such time as I was able to obtain an<br/>&gt; instrument with more than twelve keys per octave.  So I now have the<br/>&gt; meantone sound in 31 different keys (plus 7 and 11 harmony).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The lifeless or stagnant effect that some have objected to with just<br/>&gt; intonation is a result of the absence of disturbances caused by<br/>&gt; beating harmonics or non-coincident combinational tones, so interval<br/>&gt; size has a lot to do with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But any lack of life you might perceive in just intonation with sine<br/>&gt; waves would have more to do with the just major third being smaller,<br/>&gt; which makes the leading [tone] lower in pitch and less effective<br/>&gt; melodically.  If you were to try 17-ET with sine waves; I suspect you<br/>&gt; would find that it makes 12-ET sound lifeless and bland by<br/>&gt; comparison.  (At least that has been my experience with it.)  So I<br/>&gt; would say that 12-ET is about as good melodically as it is<br/>&gt; harmonically -- a compromise that does both about equally well (or<br/>&gt; badly, depending on your point of view).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Mutation stops on pipe organs are tuned to just intonation.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;When the rest of the organ is tuned to ET, the 1 3/5&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;stops are way out of tune with the major thirds!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; . . . then they [mutation stops tuned to ET as suggested by a poster, and<br/>&gt; as is done on some electronci organs] wouldn&apos;t be in a true harmonic<br/>&gt; relationship with the pipes sounding the fundamental pitch and would beat<br/>&gt; against the harmonics of those pipes, causing each and every single note to<br/>&gt; be literally out of tune all by itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Any theoretical just interval can be tuned +/- 2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;cents the theoretical value and still sound normal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;to the ear. And +/- 3 cents still sounds in tune,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;but has a celeste (vibrato) quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The beating of the thirds in 12-ET is so fast that it&apos;s not even a<br/>&gt; vibrato; I would describe it as more of a grating effect.  But you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t fully realize how bad it is until you&apos;ve spent a little time<br/>&gt; with something that has (harmonically) better thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;out-of-tuneness destroys the natural Difference<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;and Sumational Combinational tomes. These are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;obviously destroyed, or at the wrong pitch, via<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;ET tuning!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In JI the combinational tones are in exact mathematical<br/>&gt; relationship with the fundamental, but in 12-ET they&apos;re quite<br/>&gt; discordant (by practically anyone&apos;s definition of the term).  This is<br/>&gt; in addition to the fast-beating harmonics in the thirds, so 12-ET<br/>&gt; leaves a lot to be desired.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt; __________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Comments by Pauline:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps now you can see the sense in Johannus digital-sampled organs<br/>&gt; providing both MT, WM and ET tuning in one instrument! Something individual<br/>&gt; pipe organs can&apos;t provide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MT will play in 0-2 #/b, providing the B-major chord, and certain flat<br/>&gt; chords, aren&apos;t used.<br/>&gt; WM will play in 0-3 #/b generally, and in some cases 4 b.<br/>&gt; ET is needed to play in many 4 b, 4 #, or 5 b.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In scoring hymnbooks for Johannus organs I accomodate the above in the<br/>&gt; suggested Tune/Pitch/Intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt; Pauline W.
