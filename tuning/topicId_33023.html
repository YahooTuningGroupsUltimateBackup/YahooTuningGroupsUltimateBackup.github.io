I suppose the weird thing about the post is that there<br/>was no body content, so everyone was simply *guessing* about what you<br/>intended to say!

The idea of the<br/>producer as the artist, and the &quot;artists&quot; only performers,<br/>though by no means a new idea, became the norm by the<br/>early 1980&apos;s, and from 75-80 the Disco thing took a step<br/>towards manufactured music, which continues today with<br/>groove.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
