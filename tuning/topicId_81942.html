Not much to tell about this one, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; offcourse wrong.<br/>&gt; Btw I did not include the church organ midi timbre that&apos;s often used because<br/>&gt; all it&apos;s samples consist of one octave, in every octave a slightly different<br/>&gt; timbre of the other octave.<br/>&gt; So it shifts all notes in thesame octave and this is a serious modification<br/>&gt; of the composition and of harmony and melody in general.<br/>&gt; Also wish to say sorry for my last attempt to put this Lasso piece in JI.<br/>&gt; I did it in a hurry on autopilot without looking at it good. Had slept too<br/>&gt; little for a week and just had the flu so I wasn&apos;t clear in my head.<br/>&gt; Then I posted it without listening. And after I posted it and made the audio<br/>&gt; version and heard it for myself I heard it was wrong and instead of thinking<br/>&gt; the probles of this piece through properly I tried to fix the problem<br/>&gt; quickly making an even bigger mess of things.<br/>&gt; So I&apos;m very glad to finally be able to post the correct version :)<br/>&gt; This correct version is a bit of a shock to me though.<br/>&gt; As some of the chords are very dissonant.<br/>&gt; I had to seriously rethink the way I thought about JI and modulations to<br/>&gt; come to this transcription and still have to connect all the dots and learn<br/>&gt; from this piece.<br/>&gt; I also take back what I said previously that I don&apos;t like this piece, I love<br/>&gt; it now for many reasons :)<br/>&gt; One of the things that I love about it is that one of the melodies has a<br/>&gt; stepsize of 27/25.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s to me an arabic stepsize, first time I&apos;m seeing this in western<br/>&gt; music!<br/>&gt; Anyhow, I hope the people on this list can see it and hear it and then<br/>&gt; accept this is the correct JI version.<br/>&gt; Btw here 2 extra timbres of a choir.<br/>&gt; My soundcard produces terrible choirs but as it&apos;s written for choir I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; include them:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI_choir.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI_choir.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI_synthchoir.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI_synthchoir.mid</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=81965 href="#81965">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2009 10:58:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You know I&apos;m not joking.<br/>&gt; I stand 100% behind this beeing pure JI and this beeing the only<br/>&gt; way this piece is in tune.</p><p>Marcel, some of the chords here are not JI.</p><p>&gt; Yes, and so your view of music is that every major and minor<br/>&gt; triad in any inversion or transposition has to be in it&apos;s most<br/>&gt; consonant way?

You can let the pitch fall or rise as the case may be, so you end up in a slightly different key from where you started. You can allow sudden pitch shifts by a comma. You can change the harmony so that consonant intervals become dissonant. Or you can do a combination of these things. But if you don&apos;t limit yourself to strict JI you can do things like make the pitch of each note rise gradually and imperceptibly, so that when the progression ends up a comma lower, the overall pitch has risen by a comma to compensate.</p><p>&gt; Seems to tie in perfectly with my harmonic interval permuation structure &gt; theory but while I really like my theory and think it&apos;s the best one out &gt; there both in logic and in results, I don&apos;t place thesame trust in it as &gt; I do in this piece.<br/>&gt; My main theory seems perfectly suitable to decribe all parts of music in &gt; mathematics, but only the future will tell if it will hold up.<br/>&gt; &gt; But again you don&apos;t need my main theory to talk about this piece, &gt; they&apos;re to seperate things.<br/>&gt; &gt; Marcel</p><p>One difference between your theory and others is that other theories have actually produced new music. As for retuning existing music, much existing music sounds great in one or more varieties of meantone, and modern versions of adaptive JI can be quite a bit more sophisticated than Vicentino&apos;s method. Then there&apos;s the &quot;play what sounds good&quot; theory, which good acoustic musicians do without consciously thinking much about it.</p></div><h3><a id=82003 href="#82003">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2009 5:15:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel de Velde wrote:<br/>&gt; Ok here the transcription of another JI version that looks like it may &gt; be correct aswell.<br/>&gt; &gt; Transcription:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2.rtf">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2.rtf</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Midi:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_violin.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_violin.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_trombone.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_trombone.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_harmonica.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_harmonica.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_piano.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_piano.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_choir.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_choir.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_synthchoir.mid">/tuning/files/Marcel/LassoAveRegina_JI2_synthchoir.mid</a></p><p>Even the violin can&apos;t save this one.

That sort of fine control over degrees of consonance is more the kind of thing that Wilson&apos;s golden horogram scales are good for, but of course only JI gives you the most perfectly locked tuning if that&apos;s a requirement of your music.</p></div>
