Some choose a tuning or scale for its deliberately<br/>anti-organizing effect. But if such a scale or tuning *is* anti-tonal, then<br/>obviously there must be some effect that needs to be avoided. Quite<br/>how &apos;tonality&apos; manifests itself is of course one of those mystical<br/>unknowns, and I don&apos;t take the Chomskian view that there is some part of<br/>the human brain wired for music.</p><p>way more than 2cents worth.... ramble ramble...</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2002 7:46:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mark Gould&quot; &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I have great respect for the fact that Blackwood has engaged<br/>himself with<br/>&gt; microtonality, but I am not convinced of his general thesis that<br/>different<br/>&gt; tunings can be made to have a seven-tone diatonic.
