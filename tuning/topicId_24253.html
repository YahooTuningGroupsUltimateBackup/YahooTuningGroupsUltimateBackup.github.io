E.g., all 12-tet diatonic modes form<br/>a set-class, and the &quot;prime form&quot; selected to represent the set-class is<br/>[013568t], or the B-B (Locrian) mode, because it is most compact and<br/>&quot;left-packed&quot;. With 12-tet harmonic (major and minor) triads, the<br/>set-class is represented by [037], the root-position minor triad, for the<br/>same reasons.</p><p>The algorithm is: first find the modes that span the shortest distance.<br/>(In the case of diatonic modes, this allows you to reject the C-C and F-F<br/>modes only. In the case of triads you reject first- and second-inversion<br/>triads, since only root-position ones span a fifth). Then, from these,<br/>find the one whose notes are most &quot;left-packed&quot; - that is, whose interval<br/>sequence has its larger intervals nearest the upper end. There is a formal<br/>long-winded way to define this but it&apos;s probably clear intuitively.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t generally select the most &quot;natural&quot; mode to represent the<br/>scale or set-class, depending on what you judge natural, but it is<br/>straight-forward to implement, and two people using it will agree on the<br/>same answer. It is very easy to generalise for other tuning systems, since<br/>nothing about it is specific to 12-tet. And once &quot;professional&quot; music<br/>theorists get around to cataloguing microtonal entities, this will almost<br/>undoubtedly be a basis for it, given set-theory&apos;s importance in academia.</p><p>cheers --jon</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 6:24:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jon wild &lt;wild@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24253">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24253</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dan wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Given any scale, ... what methods have folks worked with<br/>&gt; (if any) that could generalize and stamp one single rotation<br/>&gt; as something that could in one way or another be called the<br/>&gt; standard rotation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Dan - this is the problem that &quot;regular&quot; music theory<br/>&gt; deals with by using prime-forms for each set-class.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This doesn&apos;t generally select the most &quot;natural&quot; mode to<br/>&gt; represent the scale or set-class, depending on what you judge<br/>&gt; natural, but it is straight-forward to implement, and two<br/>&gt; people using it will agree on the same answer.

For the same reasons that I use<br/>compact notations like &quot;3^(-2...3) * 5^(-1...1)&quot; and Erv<br/>Wilsons notations like &quot;2,4 (3 5 7 11)&quot; to describe JI<br/>systems, I like the prime-form method of describing scales<br/>in set-class theory.  I agree too that it works just as well<br/>for any other EDO as it does for 12.</p><p>Answers should probably go to the tuning-math list, and<br/>so perhaps so should this question... oh well... I&apos;d like<br/>to see more on the mathematics of manipulating sets of<br/>exponents in a JI tuning system, similar to the way<br/>academic theorists use set-theory in 12-EDO.  Any ideas<br/>on this?</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
