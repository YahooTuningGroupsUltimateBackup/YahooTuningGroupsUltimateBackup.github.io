I was confusing my simpler notion of &quot;deviation&quot; (= in respect of a necessary tempering, has a tuning any &quot;deviations&quot; for h3, h5, h7 etc. ?) with the notion of  fifths, or major thirds &quot;harmonic waste&quot; which is a measurement  (according to Claudio Di Veroli) of the sum of the &quot;errors&quot; of these intervals minus the normal error if they were pure fifths or major thirds, respectively one pythagorean comma, or four diesis (128/125).</p><p>&gt; &quot;Harmonic waste&quot; seems to be a useful concept in constructing &gt; circulating scales, but I think the name is very tendentious and &gt; misleading.

I often heard this term but I can&apos;t find a definition of it. I suppose they came after the &quot;temperaments ordinaires&quot;, and would have summed less harmonic wastes. Was it their main goal ? It&apos;s true that Werckmeister III and Valotti-Young&apos;s three larger thirds are 81/64 and according to the definition of harmonic wastes, sum up to zero waste wether in fifths or in thirds. In a a certain context it can be seen as a quality. In other contexts, accepting &quot;5-limit harmonic wastes&quot; can open to other qualities, among which more diversity. I would not say yours is &quot;full of waste&quot; anyway, but rather &quot;full of taste&quot; ;)<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
