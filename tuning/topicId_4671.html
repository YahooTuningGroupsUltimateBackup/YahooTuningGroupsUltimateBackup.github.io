Relatedly, can you put them in a fire safe for paper, or<br/>&gt; do they need to go into a fire safe for magnetic media?</p><p>CDs are not magnetic media.  &quot;Regular&quot; CDs store the data as<br/>pits stamped into aluminum, while CD-Rs use dark spots<br/>&quot;burned&quot; into a *photo-reactive* ink by a laser.  You need<br/>not worry about magnetic fields with either type.  But fire<br/>safe, shmiresafe, says I; back the sucker up.  Stick your<br/>CD-R in your CD-ROM drive, copy the data to your hard disk,<br/>back it up to some other medium, and store it &quot;off-site.&quot; CD<br/>data is computer data whether it&apos;s music or otherwise; and<br/>&quot;data that is only in one place does not exist&quot;!  (See<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> for a list of good freeware audio CD &quot;rippers.&quot;)</p><p>For CD-Rs the issue is not temperature, but light itself.<br/>Exposing the *playing side* of one to the direct light of<br/>the sun for more than a few minutes usually ruins it.  This<br/>effect is cumulative: leaving it laying face up on a desk<br/>once in a while would degrade it over a period of months or<br/>years.  If stored in a jewel case with the paper inserts in<br/>place, it should be able to withstand the *heat* of the sun<br/>from time to time without significant degradation.  Heat is<br/>somewhat lower in frequency than the red light used to burn<br/>and read CDs.  Still, I&apos;d be loath to chance it with my only<br/>copy of something I value.  (Blanks are under 2 bucks, so if<br/>you have access to a burner and the data is safely backed<br/>up, who cares?)</p><p>Of course, temperatures on car seats can reach over 150<br/>degrees F. in the summer; it&apos;s conceivable that a CD could<br/>warp in those conditions, which would ruin either kind.<br/>Otherwise, sunlight will not have any effect on &quot;regular&quot;<br/>CDs.</p><p>David J.
