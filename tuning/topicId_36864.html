The initial emphasis will probably be tuning, but threads<br/>on all other aspects of serious music making are welcome.</p><p>Fundamentally, music theory is just a mode of discourse about music.<br/>It is neither a substitute for nor a threat to music making but<br/>rather a creative pursuit that parallels and intersects with music<br/>making in ways that are interesting and frequently useful, if not<br/>enriching to music composition, performance, and audition. This list<br/>is probably not for those who are allergic to music theory or suffer<br/>from music theory anxiety.   Neither is it likely to be of much use<br/>to those who do theory in a soundless vaccuum or as a form of concept<br/>art.</p><p>As the name suggests, &quot;speculative music theory&quot; is more concerned<br/>with possible musics than with existing musics (which are treated by<br/>analytic music theory), but historical repertoire may well often be<br/>the point of departure for new speculative work.   Speculative music<br/>theory is intimately associated with the practice of composition and<br/>explores both new musical resources and new modes of musical<br/>presentation.</p><p>The list is unmoderated, but contributions are expected to be<br/>relevant, to-the-point, and civil.</p><p>Sign up at:</p><p><a href="/SpecMus/">/SpecMus/</a></p></div>
