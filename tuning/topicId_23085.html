Who can disagree?  I think it&apos;s<br/>unbelievable that we&apos;re all going around talking about &ldquo;octaves&rdquo; all the<br/>time.  Why use this term at all?  It&apos;s inconsistent with every view of music<br/>that refers to something other than some pattern of 8 subtended by 2:1.<br/>Heck, even an &ldquo;octave&rdquo; of 12 parts is totally illogical.  Consult the New<br/>Harvard dictionary of music and we see that an &ldquo;octave&rdquo; is defined as a<br/>ratio of frequencies which is a double, i.e., 2:1.  Duh.  It says absolutely<br/>nothing about the &ldquo;oct&rdquo; being of any significance.  8 what?  What does 8<br/>have to do it?  Nothing.  Ok, 8 is twice 4, and 8 feet strings and pipes are<br/>the &ldquo;written = sounding&rdquo; pitches on organs and pianos, etc.  Ok, consult New<br/>Groves and get a better definition.  Ok, I know, Greek theory... who is<br/>talking about Greek theory when they say &ldquo;72 equal divisions of an octave&rdquo;?<br/>So okay, use it in Greek theory.  Use it in historical music theory where<br/>everone else was talking about &ldquo;octaves.&rdquo;  But let&rsquo;s face it: &ldquo;octave&rdquo; is a<br/>meaningless term in 21st century microtonality.*  Call it 2.  It&apos;s 2.  Even<br/>&ldquo;regular&rdquo; musicians might like it.  A flute overblows at 2.  A clarinet<br/>overblows at 3.  How hard is that?  Makes a lot more sense than an &quot;octave&quot;<br/>and a &quot;twelfth&quot;  and it puts the cognition in the right place.  8 and 12 have<br/>nothing to do with it.  2 and 3 do.</p><p>...*but there&apos;s another silly term: &ldquo;microtonality&rdquo;.  Why don&apos;t we just say<br/>&ldquo;music&rdquo;  That&apos;s all it is ... it&apos;s all music...  but that&apos;s another rant e<br/>ntirely.</p><p>shalom,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=23104 href="#23104">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/18/2001 7:00:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/18/01 2:15:24 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:Pitchcolor@aol.com">Pitchcolor@aol.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; ...*but there&apos;s another silly term: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;microtonality&acirc;&euro;&#x9D;.
