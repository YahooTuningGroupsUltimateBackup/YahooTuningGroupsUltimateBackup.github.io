Thanks for your interest and comments.</p><p>Mats,</p><p>&gt;First off,i suppose the&quot;Lars&quot;you mean is me,</p><p>Sorry. I usually see your name written in an unpronounceably<br/>manner with questions marks replacing some characters. All<br/>the characters I used did appear in your name, and your name<br/>is the same number of characters with 50% in the same place,<br/>it&apos;s probably not a coincidence that it&apos;s your middle name as<br/>well! (just kidding.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;form from another vantage point. I reversed the L and s and had for<br/>&gt;&gt;all practical purposes a 9 of 24<br/>&gt;&gt;  L   s   L   s   L   s   L   s   L<br/>&gt;0 204 249 453 498 702 747 951 996<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Not the same,but totally different.This is nothing else than<br/>&gt;  the&quot;Pentaenharmonic&quot;mode that i wrote about a long time ago,in<br/>&gt;  this post:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.egroups.co.uk/message/tuning/19786">http://www.egroups.co.uk/message/tuning/19786</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Except that i used 19tet,which you did not mention.</p><p>I&apos;ll check out the post you refer to, although 19tet would<br/>seem to compromise the &apos;9 prime limit&apos; qualities, which are<br/>really the only &apos;consonant&apos; handles on the scale. I wasn&apos;t<br/>attempting to fit this &apos;transposable structure&apos; into an<br/>EDO but if I were, 29 and 53 look to be choices that would<br/>preserve the qualities I found attractive. 19 looks very<br/>different, with L/s = 3 rather than 5 and 4.5 of 29 and<br/>53 respectively.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2001 7:42:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24312">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24312</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll check out the post you refer to, although 19tet would<br/>&gt; seem to compromise the &apos;9 prime limit&apos; qualities, which are<br/>&gt; really the only &apos;consonant&apos; handles on the scale.
