Although quantitative studies of the WTC appear to<br/>reveal that its composition was indeed informed by such a tuning, it is also<br/>known that a good number of its pieces were simply transposed from earlier<br/>works, originally in meantone or meantone-like keys of a well-temperament,<br/>into the supposedly most &quot;dissonant&quot; or Pythagorean-like keys of<br/>well-temperament. So one cannot be too dogmatic about a particular form of<br/>circulating temperament for Bach&apos;s late keyboard works. All we know for sure<br/>is that, once he had adopted the premise of a closed 12-tone temperament,<br/>Bach instructed that the major thirds be tuned sharp in order to achieve<br/>that end.</p></div>
