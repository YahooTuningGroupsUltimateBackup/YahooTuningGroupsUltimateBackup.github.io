However, I would be<br/>very interested in knowing the kind of vertical style involved: what<br/>is the role of major and minor thirds and sixths, for example?</p><p>My advocacy of Pythagorean tuning, and what John Chalmers has referred<br/>to as &quot;para-Pythagorean&quot; scales such as 29-tET, 46-tET, and 17-tET --<br/>with 22-tET a very interesting scale also in this kind of role -- is<br/>in a setting of the Gothic music of 13th-14th century Europe, or<br/>derivative &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; styles. Here the patterns are radically<br/>different from those of 18th-19th century European music.</p><p>Specifically, Gothic and neo-Gothic music is based on the use of<br/>active and unstable thirds and sixths as points of some tension,<br/>frequently leading to directed cadential resolutions involving melodic<br/>motions by compact semitones (~50-90 cents). Often major thirds expand<br/>to fifths, and major sixths to octave, while minor thirds contract to<br/>unisons. Additionally, the minor seventh often contracts to a fifth<br/>while a major second may expand to a fourth.</p><p>The unit of stable sonority is the complete trine (2:3:4) with outer<br/>octave, lower fifth, and upper fourth; various kinds of sonorities<br/>including unstable thirds and sixths resolve to complete trines, or<br/>often to the prime trinic interval of the fifth.</p><p>In this kind of style, Pythagorean or &quot;para-Pythagorean&quot; tunings with<br/>wide major thirds and sixths, and narrow minor thirds and diatonic<br/>semitones, fit the texture and cadential action of the music.</p><p>For more on the original Gothic use of Pythagorean tuning, you might<br/>visit:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>For a &quot;Gentle Introduction to neo-Gothic progressions&quot; discussing some<br/>intervals, sonorities, and cadences, see:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038">/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038</a>  (1/Pt 1)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630">/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630</a>  (1/Pt 2A)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685">/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685</a>  (1/Pt 2B)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134">/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134</a>  (1/Pt 2C)</p><p>In contrast, typical 16th-19th century European music treats<br/>thirds and sixths as stable and restful concords, specifically leaning<br/>toward the simplest ratios of 5:4 and 6:5. The style is different, and<br/>so is the intonational ideal.</p><p>As far as Zarlino goes, I would say that both his ideal of just<br/>intonation and his practical advocacy of meantone tuning on keyboards<br/>nicely reflects the musical ethos and style of his era, just as<br/>Pythagorean tuning reflects that of the Gothic era.</p><p>To comment in a more informed manner on this thread, I would want to<br/>know just what kind of music Ogolevets was advocating in 17-tET or<br/>22-tET.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=23556 href="#23556">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2001 12:17:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In contrast, typical 16th-19th century European music treats<br/>&gt; thirds and sixths as stable and restful concords, specifically<br/>leaning<br/>&gt; toward the simplest ratios of 5:4 and 6:5.

This view was far from universal, though, and at<br/>least as many theorists still clung to a meantone ideal. But the<br/>demise of the consonant thirds and sixths was well underway.</p><p>&gt; To comment in a more informed manner on this thread, I would want to<br/>&gt; know just what kind of music Ogolevets was advocating in 17-tET or<br/>&gt; 22-tET.</p><p>I believe someone just said it was music in the Classical/Romantic<br/>style . . . if I remember correctly.</p></div>
