Then<br/>&gt;all intervals within that template are possible interpretations, and<br/>&gt;others aren&apos;t. If this is the way it works, it doesn&apos;t matter if you are<br/>&gt;holding the lower note, upper note, arithmetic mean, or geometric mean<br/>&gt;constant.</p><p>Doesn&apos;t the Plomp/Levelt result for two sine waves eliminate the<br/>possibility of any such &quot;template&quot; (and maybe even the whole idea of<br/>tonalness and entropy based on ratios). As I understand it, if such a<br/>template exists it should work just as well for sine waves as for harmonic<br/>timbres. Don&apos;t tonalness and your harmonic entropy merely assume that there<br/>are no inharmonic partials, but don&apos;t require harmonic ones. I understand<br/>that with low amplitude sine tones very little happens at the octave or<br/>fifth (let alone anthing more complex), and what does happen can be<br/>attributed to combination tones generated by non-linearities.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=2110 href="#2110">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Thus, psychoacoustic consonance cannot be<br/>considered as the basis of the sense of musical intervals. The basisi of<br/>that sense seems to be provided by the _concept of virtual pitch_. This<br/>concept is introduced with a model. The concept accounts for many<br/>psychoacoustic and musical phenomena as, e.g., the ambiguity of pitch of<br/>complex tones, the &quot;residue,&quot; the pitch of inharmonic signals, the<br/>dominance of certain harmonics, pitch shifts, the sense for musical<br/>intervals, octave periodicity, octave enlargement, &quot;stretching&quot; of<br/>musical scales, and the &quot;tonal meaning&quot; of chords in music.<br/>*****</p><p>So before putting all one&apos;s eggs in the Plomp/Levelt/Sethares basket,<br/>one has to at least consider all the phenomena listed above, how well<br/>they can be explained by roughness, how well they can be explained by<br/>virtual pitch, and their musical importance. My own feeling is that<br/>while not all the phenomena that Terhardt lists support his conclusions,<br/>enough do so that virtual pitch cannot be ignored from any informed<br/>discussion of consonance. If nothing else, comparing otonal and utonal<br/>chords of, say, the 11-limit should be evidence enough that roughness<br/>isn&apos;t everything.</p><p>Consider this clincher from the second page of the same Terhardt<br/>article:</p><p>*****<br/>[a long list of examples, this last one is really good:]. . . single<br/>isolated complex tones are the elements of music and never are regarded<br/>to be dissonant. However, a single complex tone can sound very rough,<br/>e.g., when it is produced by a pulse-like sound sourse of low repetition<br/>rate.</p><p>&#x9;Hence it must be concluded:</p><p>&#x9;(1) The experimental results on consonance and roughness appear<br/>to be significant and consistent, and thus provide a solid babsis of _a<br/>certain kind of consonance_, i. e., of _psychoacoustic consonance_. The<br/>psychoacoustic consonance of any sound is related to the absence of<br/>roughness. To this extent, Helmholtz&apos;s (1863) consonance theory is<br/>strongly supported.</p><p>&#x9;(2) _However_, psychoacoustic consonance is distinctly different<br/>from another kind of consonance which plays a basic role in tonal music.<br/>The universal importance of harmonic intervals in music cannot be<br/>explained satisfactory [sic] by the concept of psychoacoustic<br/>consonance.<br/>*****</p><p>Two things should be interjected at this point: Since the virtual pitch<br/>phenomenon is clearly a psychoacoustic one, the term &quot;psychoacoustic<br/>consonance&quot; for non-virtual-pitch-related consonance is unfortunate.<br/>Thankfully, this term has been replaced by &quot;sensory consonance&quot; in the<br/>recent literature. Secondly, the emphasis on &quot;musical intervals&quot; in the<br/>abstract above is misplaced. A sense of intervals and associated melodic<br/>functions is found in the vast majority of musical cultures and has its<br/>own logic, informed by the sense of similarity at the octave, fifth, and<br/>fourth, but otherwise having nothing to do with consonance.</p><p>Terhardt &quot;derives&quot; a model like my Farey series model (in his case, a<br/>Farey series of order 8, although Goldstein found virtual pitch effects<br/>involving higher harmonics) and also comes up with a probabilistic<br/>formulation for the interpretation of the stimulus:</p><p>*****<br/>. . . in many cases there exist _several_ maxima of the<br/>virtual-pitch-cue distribution. Hence it is defined that the probability<br/>with which a particular virtual pitch is ascribed to the stimulus<br/>depends on the height of the corresponding maximum.<br/>*****</p><p>Terhardt&apos;s model is based on a learning process and by considering known<br/>non-linearities (that is, shifts) in the pitch-perception process, his<br/>model accounts for pitch shifts in the template which lead to a<br/>preference for slightly enlarged intervals, something my harmonic<br/>entropy model ignores but Brian McLaren has emphasized fervently.</p><p>Terhardt dismisses combination tones as a basis for musical harmony:</p><p>*****<br/>as is revealed by the results of, e. g., Plomp (1965), in the sounds of<br/>music, difference tones only rarely have a chance to be perceptually<br/>relevant. In most cases they remain below the threshold of hearing and<br/>in most of the remaining cases are masked with high probability by the<br/>musical sound itself. Moreover, when in special cases difference tones<br/>become audible (e. g., when two flutes are playing a duo), their effect<br/>in general is annoying instead of &quot;harmonic.&quot;<br/>*****</p><p>This last point I think is especially important -- there are still<br/>people around (e. g., Heinz Bohlen) who think combination tones are the<br/>basis of harmony but I believe this last example is a death-blow to that<br/>theory.</p><p>Terhardt admits that his model is imperfect. He does not consider &quot;pitch<br/>phenomena which are produced by &apos;quasirandom&apos; signals (e. g.,<br/>&apos;time-separation pitch,&apos; &apos;repetition pitch,&apos; &apos;periodicity pitch&apos; of<br/>interrupted noise).&quot; But if anything, these phenomena provide further<br/>evidence of the importance of the virtual pitch concept, and certainly<br/>not of a Helmholtz-type &quot;place&quot; theory of hearing.</p><p>Some of Terhardt&apos;s conclusions:</p><p>*****<br/>&#x9;The realization of musical sounds seems to be governed by the<br/>two foregoing principles which may be termed _the principle of minimal<br/>roughness_ and _the principle of tonal meanings_. Both principles imply<br/>certain requirements for the fundamental-frequency ratios and spectral<br/>configurations of realized _musical chords_. If the pitch shifts in the<br/>peripheral auditory system would not exist, the requirements of both<br/>principles were well compatible. In particular, both principles would<br/>require the same precise small-integer frequency ratios of the<br/>fundamentals of musical tones. However, since there exist the phenomena<br/>of pitch shifts and, thereby, of interval stretching, both requirements<br/>become conflicting.</p><p>&#x9;Musical _scales_ are established in order to make musical<br/>_intervals_ realizable. With respect to the tuning of musical scales it<br/>follows from the third conclusion that _every_ kind of tuning is a<br/>compromise. If a musical scale is tuned strictly according to the<br/>requirements of the &quot;principle of minimal roughness,&quot; one obtains the<br/>_just scale_ [Terhardt not really correct on this, as the well-known<br/>comma problem of the pentatonic and diatonic scales demonstrates].<br/>However, this just scale, which by the &quot;classical&quot; theory of music is<br/>considered as an ideal, disregards the requirements of the &quot;principle of<br/>tonal meanings&quot; (i. e., insofar as interval stretching is involved).<br/>Thus, the new theoretical point of view developed in the present article<br/>reveals that even the just scale is a compromise [I would say, a<br/>compromise beyond that revealed by comma problems].</p><p>&#x9;_The equally tempered scale_, chosen for practical purposes (i.<br/>e., to make it easy to play on keyboard instruments in every key) does<br/>look much less &quot;blasphemic&quot; from the new point of view than it does in<br/>the light of the &quot;classical&quot; theory [again, Terhardt commits the common<br/>error of forgetting about syntonic commas, but his point remains]. On<br/>the basis of the foregoing conclusions, the equally tempered scale can<br/>be considered as just one of several compromises.<br/>*****</p><p>More to come . . .</p></div><h3><a id=2127 href="#2127">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/1999 3:17:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow!
