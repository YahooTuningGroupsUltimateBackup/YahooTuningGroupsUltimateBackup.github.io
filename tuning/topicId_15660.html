It seems to me that JI<br/>and the various forms of temperament (regular and irregular) are and<br/>should be free to take in the valleys, plateaus, and summits of the<br/>intonational landscape -- from the most simple to the most complex.</p><p>The idea of &quot;tuning by integer ratios,&quot; of course, may carry various<br/>implications for various people and styles of music, for example:</p><p>     (1) Using the simplest and purest possible ratios for stable<br/>         concords in a given style;</p><p>     (2) Preferring epimores or superparticular ratios for intervals<br/>         making up a tetrachord, for example (e.g. 9:8-8:7-28:27);</p><p>     (3) Seeking to maximize the simplicity or &quot;suavity&quot; of certain<br/>         unstable intervals and combinations as well as stable ones,<br/>         e.g. 4:5:6:7 in an 18th-century setting (Euler), or 7:9:12<br/>         in a neo-14th-century setting.</p><p>Possibly one might use capitalization to suggest a difference in<br/>nuance between a &quot;just&quot; interval (any integer ratio) and a Just<br/>interval (an interval with a _small_ integer ratio readily tuneable by<br/>ear by a locking in of partials).</p><p>Also, JI systems feature what we might regard as three types of<br/>intervals:</p><p>        (1) &quot;Simple&quot; JI intervals a la Dave Keenan, or the &quot;valleys&quot;<br/>             of Paul Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy, where locking in of<br/>             partials occurs, with Paul&apos;s suggested upper limit of<br/>             complexity by the point for a ratio a:b where a*b=105.</p><p>        (2) &quot;Intermediate&quot; JI intervals such as 14:11 or 13:11 where<br/>             combination tones may give ratios something of a<br/>             &quot;quasi-Just&quot; quality (I leave this as an open question).</p><p>        (3) &quot;Complex&quot; JI intervals such as the regular Pythagorean<br/>             major and minor thirds at 81:64 and 32:27, as well as<br/>             a variety of large-integer ratios in more recent JI<br/>             systems (e.g. LaMonte Young).</p><p>A typical JI system may have some intervals from each of these three<br/>categories, which is to say that _some_ just intervals are also Just<br/>or &quot;pure.&quot;</p><p>In a JI array I posted here some weeks back, for example, and for<br/>which the Monz designed a beautiful lattice, I find it natural to<br/>speak of &quot;a pure 3:2&quot;; somewhat more of a poetic trope or liberty to<br/>speak of &quot;a pure 14:11&quot;; and quite unlikely to speak of &quot;a pure<br/>12544:9801.&quot; Yet all three intervals are part of the total musical<br/>reality, the first two by design and the last as a kind of<br/>serendipitous gift, each with its own musical beauty.</p><p>As Leonhard Euler approached the problem of consonance/dissonance, so<br/>would I approach the diverse intervals of JI: there is a continuum of<br/>the simple and the complex.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=15664 href="#15664">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>11/19/2000 1:44:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

An observation<br/>that I have made during my exploration of the spectrum scales, is<br/>that inharmonic instruments do indeed sound more consonant when tuned<br/>to intervals derived from the timbre itself. Some of the electronic<br/>timbres I analyzed were inharmonic FM sounds which I had been<br/>familiar with using and hearing in 31 Prime Limit JI for years (e.g.<br/>some bell-like pads with no attack transients). When I tuned them to<br/>their own spectrum scales - which had wildly high number ratios (!) -<br/>they all sounded much more appropriately tuned than I had ever heard<br/>before. It&apos;s hard to explain what an epiphany this was to hear this<br/>same kind of effect - this beautifully sweet and sometimes eerie<br/>harmony and melody - on many different timbres and tunings. I would<br/>test them in 12tEt, and JI, but none sounded as good. Now I&apos;m seeing<br/>all this as two distinct philosophical approaches to tuning - (1.)<br/>Temperaments, JI etc.., where one is primarily concerned with the<br/>fundamental pitch relationships alone (overtones fall where they will<br/>relative to the chosen tuning system), and (2.) Spectrum Scales,<br/>where the timbres dictate the appropriate tuning (where imposing an n-<br/>tET or JI tuning isn&apos;t appropriate). Inharmonic timbres take on a<br/>whole new life with the latter - hearing is believing.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea of &quot;tuning by integer ratios,&quot; of course, may carry various<br/>&gt; implications for various people and styles of music, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (1) Using the simplest and purest possible ratios for stable<br/>&gt;          concords in a given style;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (2) Preferring epimores or superparticular ratios for intervals<br/>&gt;          making up a tetrachord, for example (e.g. 9:8-8:7-28:27);<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (3) Seeking to maximize the simplicity or &quot;suavity&quot; of certain<br/>&gt;          unstable intervals and combinations as well as stable ones,<br/>&gt;          e.g. 4:5:6:7 in an 18th-century setting (Euler), or 7:9:12<br/>&gt;          in a neo-14th-century setting.</p><p>And I humbly add a possible 4th implication: Choosing the intervals<br/>in a tuning for their unique melodic properties (a primary focus<br/>here). Many times I find that what might not work well in &quot;full<br/>fisted harmony&quot; (a humorous term I use for the 12tET compositional<br/>style of a &quot;child piano prodigy&quot; friend of mine), is wondrous when<br/>played melodically.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Leonhard Euler approached the problem of consonance/dissonance,<br/>so<br/>&gt; would I approach the diverse intervals of JI: there is a continuum<br/>of<br/>&gt; the simple and the complex.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s like an infinite color palette to chose from. As always, context<br/>dictates correct choices.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=15671 href="#15671">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/2000 7:17:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
