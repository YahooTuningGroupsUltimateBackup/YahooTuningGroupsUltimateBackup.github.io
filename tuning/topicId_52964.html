I use piano roll view and have a chart of all the ratios<br/>and which &quot;notes&quot; correspond to them.  It&apos;s a single reed sound from an organ<br/>made up of several sounds, so this sample alone is not so reedy.  I sampled<br/>the original pitch bend sounds from one single sample, so the ET that was<br/>being bent was exact.<br/>I&apos;d like to share it if anyone is interested.  The file is about 35 Mb, and I don&apos;t<br/>have a website.  I&apos;ll send you a CD if you want.<br/>One thing, though, I haven&apos;t had time yet to set the loops on the samples, so<br/>each note only lasts 3 seconds or so.<br/>Works great in Cakewalk.  By next semester I will be well on my way to<br/>submitting a JI composition for my jury.</p><p>Anyone have recommendations for decent retunable synths?  I want:<br/>touch-sensitive keys<br/>88 keys<br/>retunable note for note, not restricted to octaves.  Like it&apos;ll let me tell it what Hz<br/>for each key or something.</p><p>That&apos;s about all my requirements.  It doesn&apos;t have to have its own sounds,<br/>though that would be nice.  Doesn&apos;t have to have a sequencer.  I&apos;ve never<br/>bought a decent keyboard, so I&apos;m kind of in the dark.</p><p>Thanks.<br/>Chuckk</p></div>
