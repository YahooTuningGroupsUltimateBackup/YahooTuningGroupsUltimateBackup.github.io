I believe in microtonality in music.  My<br/>&gt; ideas are simple yet they can produce complex ideas.  For me,<br/>&gt; microtonality will have to be an extension to what we know<br/>&gt; already, 12 tone e.t.  The possibilities are still endless...<br/>&gt; but when you bend the string on a guitar or use your voice to<br/>&gt; sing small steps-- you must know what you are producing as a<br/>&gt; composer.  Good music is always going to be good music no matter<br/>&gt; what age or era, contemporary or modern.  My favorite microtonal<br/>&gt; music I have heard so far is Carillo.  You have to let the theory<br/>&gt; be in the background of the actual music, that is the feelings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take care and enjoy talking about such an underground topic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John<br/>&gt; Clearwater</p><p>Makes sense to me.  Good luck in your explorations.  I should<br/>listen to more Carillo.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2007 11:32:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Christ Lives Within&quot;<br/>&lt;preciousatonement@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi I am an artist.
