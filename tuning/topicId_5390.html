I am also in a quandry with trying to find a<br/>managable way to notate in my sequencer/notation program the 53-note equal<br/>temperament. This temperament is great in that it produces a JI scale on<br/>any of the 53 scale steps, thus allowing instantaneous transposition<br/>(although certainly not modulation!). The effect in Midi playback is<br/>awesome, but it&apos;s mind-bogglingly difficult to translate my shorthand<br/>notation of the microtonal scale steps into the real, re-mapped scale steps<br/>(0-127) that the synth must receive from the computer (i.e. a C2+three<br/>53-note scale steps might actually be a G#6 in the re-tuned synth-ugh!).<br/>Does anyone know of a program which would &quot;translate&quot; the notes on a<br/>notation staff, with perhaps numbers on top of the 12 notes to indicate a<br/>specific 53-note scale step, into the actual re-mapped scale steps (0-127)<br/>of the synth?</p><p>HELP ME, BEN SOMMER</p><p>p.s. An excellent theoretical book comparing and evaluating JI, Meantone,<br/>and equal tempered scales is Easley Blackwood&apos;s &quot;THE STRUCTURE OF<br/>RECOGNIZABLE DIATONIC TUNINGS&quot;</p></div><h3>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;drew_skyfyre@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/1999 4:52:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ben, a few random thoughts :</p><p>1) Lime (notation software, @$60.00, Win/Mac)<br/>   <a href="http://datura.cerl.uiuc.edu/Lime/WhatsNew.html">http://datura.cerl.uiuc.edu/Lime/WhatsNew.html</a></p><p>   But you&apos;ll need a way to convert(map) the MIDI output to allow<br/>   your synth to actually play microtonally, perhaps Max on a Mac.</p><p>2) Common Music (Win/Mac/etc.)<br/>   <a href="http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/CCRMA/Software/cm/cm.html">http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/CCRMA/Software/cm/cm.html</a></p><p>   You&apos;ll have to change the way u work to use CM, since it involves<br/>   specifying your music in a text file program of sorts, somewhat like<br/>   Csound. But CM is NOT a synthesis program. It is a built for composition,<br/>   is OMS savvy &amp; well suited to MIDI use.</p><p>   This may be the easiest (&amp; a more rewarding) way to work with<br/>   microtonality, especially when dealing with tunings with<br/>   more than 12 notes. Personally I&apos;m trying to break away from the<br/>   conventional linear approach to composing music, mainly inspired by<br/>   playing with the SuperCollider demo ( &amp; glorious lack of formal training<br/>   !:-)</p><p>3) Use a sequencer that allows u to create &quot;note name&quot; lists, such as the<br/>   kind that shows up for percussion tracks, with the name of ea. instrument<br/>   beside the appropriate MIDI note no. So u can make a note name lis<br/>   featuring anything u need.</p><p>   Try : MidiGraphy (Mac)<br/>   <a href="http://ux01.so-net.ne.jp/~mmaeda/indexe.html">http://ux01.so-net.ne.jp/~mmaeda/indexe.html</a></p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interesting reading can be found here :<br/><a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/j.ingram/index.htm">http://home.t-online.de/home/j.ingram/index.htm</a></p><p>The home page of James Ingram, the chap who does work for Stockhausen.<br/>See his info about his work for the big S. &amp; The Notation of Time<br/>(Essay, 1985)</p><p>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I came across a couple of neat Brian McLaren posts from a while back.

To what extent if any does someone need to apply dots to paper to prove that a score for the work exists. Furthermore has digital culture made the entire concept of writing the score completely obsolete. I for one have never enjoyed writing music on to paper and usually get frustrated with the performance of things i have &quot;written&quot; always having to explain that B = 60 hz whatever.The things I used a keyboard and a program to input always came across flawlessly(though by that time my ensemble had been together for three years). For people interested in unusal tunings it causes immediate problems for folks who do not know that a B+ means adding a comma ++ a liemma or whatev. So i have always chosen to give people points of potentiality and let them choose what sound to bring in to activity. I have always been drawn to Cage and Brown et al and their form of &quot;notation&quot; Also i think program!<br/>s like Cakewalk,Finale etc when composing for midi etc.....have really removed the NEED to learn to write music in the old fashioned way. i think that continuing to write music with arcane dots on paper plays into the hands of the pedagogy and system that has repressed music for so long, so i am glad to read that McClaren(when not bashing folks) was making a point about modernism in composition. Frankly and on a deeper level this brings up the topic of ownership and the way a truly modern (post64Beatles) ensemble works. Can someone claim ownership of a piece of music really? Jokingly we discussed owning certain intervals (which i still own the 1/1 so pay UP!)and in true modern collaborative ensembles ownership of a JAM or a collective exploration can be considered by some (Conrad,Cale) as a form of theft and elitism. I think that NO-one does anything alone, but may elaborate and groom a concept to make it something that makes them happy.
