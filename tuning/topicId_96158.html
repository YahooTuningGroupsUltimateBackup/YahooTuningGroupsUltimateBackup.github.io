If mine wins then I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t just reinvented the wheel, I&apos;ve improved on it.</p><p>Like I said in my initial post, your temperament is *not* a Meantone but a well-temperament that is loosely based on Meantone (even if you didn&apos;t design it with that in mind).  The way well-temperaments work is by tempering different intervals in the scale by different amounts, so that more keys (and thus, more chords) become usable but some pure harmonies are retained.  I know diddly-squat about well-temperaments in general, except that they historically preceded equal temperament and there were probably hundreds (if not thousands) of them.  They aren&apos;t hard to come up with, really.  George Secor and Margo Schulter are the resident experts on WT&apos;s and could tell you an awful lot more about them than I can.  Hopefully one of them will chime in, or Carl perhaps.
