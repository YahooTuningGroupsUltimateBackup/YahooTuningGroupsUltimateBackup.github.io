That would be much more distinguishable in comparison. The same goes for -7. The musicians here (particularly the Arabs) are very much accustomed to interpret a note flatted this way as a sesquitone for maqams such as hicaz, huzzam and saba, although in Arel-Ezgi theory, it is certainly a limma.

I like the first version as it is now, save for the 7th and 8th<br/>degrees. Degree +7 is best with the old symbol, and double sharp +8<br/>is best with the newest X.</p><p>For +8 you are referring to the double-sharp labeled &quot;new2&quot; (the &quot;2&quot;<br/>indicating that it appears in Tartini-plus set #2), right?  If so, I<br/>will then incorporate that into Tartini-plus set #1.  (I expect that<br/>Dave will also be putting it in the Sagittal font.)</p><p>&gt; For number seven, you may like to consider an asterisk.</p><p>We spent a lot of time on this one trying to make it look more like<br/>an &quot;X&quot; (double-sharp) with a backslash (5-comma-down) through it<br/>rather than an asterisk, so I would ask you to reconsider this.</p><p>As long as we&apos;re talking about the double-sharp, did you notice the<br/>difference between the double-flat (-8) in symbol sets #1 and #2?</p><p>&gt; 2. Do please consider moving the sloping slash of -3 flat up a<br/>little so that the b of the flat is distinct as in Maqam Notation.<br/>That would be much more distinguishable in comparison. The same goes<br/>for -7. The musicians here (particularly the Arabs) are very much<br/>accustomed to interpret a note flatted this way as a sesquitone for<br/>maqams such as hicaz, huzzam and saba, although in Arel-Ezgi theory,<br/>it is certainly a limma. That way, it resembles +3 more than +2. If<br/>it is too distasteful, then consider using the old version with the<br/>slash going through the ring of b.</p><p>A concern that Dave and I had with the old version of the -3 symbol<br/>is that it should look smaller than the -4 (flat), so that it will be<br/>readily interpreted as something that&apos;s smaller than a flat, which is<br/>not the case when a slash is added to a flat symbol.  Both of our new<br/>versions of -3 (marked &quot;new1&quot; and &quot;new2&quot; according to the symbol set<br/>in which they appear) have a slash added to a flat that has been<br/>reduced in width in order to achieve a smaller appearance, but they<br/>are slightly different for very specific reasons.</p><p>For new2, the &quot;flat&quot; portion of the symbol is simply -2 laterally<br/>mirrored, giving the -3 symbol the same amount of white space inside<br/>the loop as in -2.  Here the slash portion of the symbol does not<br/>extend to the right of the stem, because it&apos;s supposed to resemble<br/>the +1 (half-arrow) symbol in that set.</p><p>For new1 the &quot;flat&quot; portion of the -3 symbol is intermediate in width<br/>between the -2 and -4 symbols, and the slash replaces the upper part<br/>of the flat curve, reducing the amount of white space to<br/>approximately the same as in -2.  The slash is bisected by the stem<br/>of the flat to form a &quot;plus&quot; sign on the lower part of the stem<br/>resembling the +1 (plus-sign) symbol of the first set.</p><p>But you are saying that somehow the &quot;b&quot; is not distinct enough and<br/>that the slash should be moved slightly upward.  This would make the<br/>amount of white space intermediate between the -2 semiflat and -4<br/>flat.  I have added this as -3b at the lower right part of the<br/>updated figure:</p><p><a href="/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/">/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/</a><br/>where the filename is still Symset41.gif</p><p>To the immediate left of this I have placed -3a (copy of new1) and -4<br/>(flat) and also, to the immediate right, -2 (semiflat), for an easy<br/>(side-by-side) comparison.  At the extreme right is -7b, formed by<br/>combining -3b and -4.  Do these meet with your approval?</p><p>&gt; 3. I retract my criticism of -1. Upon closer observation, it looks<br/>very good as it is.</p><p>Hooray!  :-)</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div>
