Just transpose the structure<br/>3-4-5 up and down from a basic position, exactly as is done in the<br/>traditional music of Corsica and Sardinia, though they choose melodic<br/>&quot;closeness&quot; rather than harmonic, transposing by a whole step up and<br/>down rather than a fifth.</p><p>&gt; If so, what<br/>&gt;are the five notes and how does it fit into the harmonic minor scale?<br/> &gt;I&apos;m assuming that they are related to each other.</p><p>This is not a valid assumption.
