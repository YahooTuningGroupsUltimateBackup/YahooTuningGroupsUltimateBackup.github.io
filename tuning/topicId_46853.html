You<br/>should be able to get this info from the archives.  They are mostly within 2003.</p><p>Most recently I tuned a piano for concert artist Joshua Pierce in<br/>Werckmeister III.  Afterwards, Joshua called me an remarked that he heard the equivalence<br/>of each note in every octave.  My aim was to &quot;not stretch octaves&quot; if I<br/>could.  This was the direction given by Werckmeister, himself, in his tuning<br/>directions.</p><p>While I am not a pianist, I have had the opportunity to notice that the<br/>players &quot;never&quot; tune for themselves (which is odd it itself to me).  Players do<br/>have their favorite tuners, with the wealthier among them paying for their travel<br/>to the individual gigs.  Some, like Horowitz, travel with their favorite<br/>piano.</p><p>The big issue is the inharmonicity of the piano tone.  Since the<br/>&quot;inharmonics&quot; of the single string are out of tune with each other, it is easy enough to<br/>recognize there will be difficulties in matching 3 strings to each other, let<br/>alone align them throughout the full keyboard range.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there are others on this list that would like to add from their own<br/>perspectives, so I will conclude for now.  BTW, Arnhem is one of my favorite<br/>places on the planet.  You must know of some of my friends there, Bram<br/>Kreeftmeijer and Dorien Verheijden, among others.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=46857 href="#46857">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2003 11:04:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; The big issue is the inharmonicity of the piano tone.
