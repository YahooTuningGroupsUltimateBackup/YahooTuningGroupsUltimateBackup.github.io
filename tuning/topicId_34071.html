So far<br/>George, you&apos;ve been notating the easy ones. How does your notational<br/>semantics handle 20,25,27,28,30,32,37,42,44-tET. In most of these the<br/>septimal comma vanishes and the syntonic comma and undecimal diesis<br/>are the same size (1 or 2 steps) and the apotome (size of sharp or<br/>flat) is 4 to 7 steps and is equal to, or nearly equal to, the size of<br/>the whole tone (8:9). And so e.g. C# is way higher than Db and<br/>therefore sharps and flats are next to useless if we wish to have<br/>letters monotonic with pitch.</p></div><h3><a id=34183 href="#34183">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 6:19:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The difference is that I&apos;m not looking at lower consistent tunings<br/>&gt; like 20 as consistent JI sets relative to commas, but rather as<br/>&gt; subsets of larger consistent tunings where their generators are<br/>&gt; considered commensurate--here&apos;s the 20 out of 31 example I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; using in Fokker interval names:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  4   1   5   6  11  17<br/>&gt; --, --, --, --, --, --, ...<br/>&gt;  7   2   9  11  20  31<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; perfect prime<br/>&gt; augmented prime<br/>&gt; minor second<br/>&gt; major second<br/>&gt; supra second<br/>&gt; minor third<br/>&gt; mean third<br/>&gt; supra third<br/>&gt; infra fourth<br/>&gt; supra fourth<br/>&gt; augmented fourth-diminished fifth<br/>&gt; infra fifth<br/>&gt; supra fifth<br/>&gt; infra sixth<br/>&gt; mean sixth<br/>&gt; major sixth<br/>&gt; infra seventh<br/>&gt; minor seventh<br/>&gt; major seventh<br/>&gt; diminished octave<br/>&gt; perfect octave<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least this way we don&apos;t have the confusions of 750&cent; 3/2s and 450&cent;<br/>&gt; 5/4s as we would with a vis a vis JI based consistency notation.

Each<br/>one notated as BC G D A EF but with accidentals to distinguish the<br/>four chains. If you don&apos;t like the double-letters BC and EF then I&apos;d<br/>suggest just using C and E and you have to remember that E:C is a<br/>fifth and C:E is a fourth. Yes it&apos;s messy however you do it. And<br/>although 20-tET is not 3,5-consistent. It is 3,7,11-consistent and<br/>3,11,13-consistent. It happens that the 3,7-comma vanishes while the<br/>3,11-comma is 1 step and the 3,13-comma is 2 steps. I&apos;ve come around<br/>to accepting Gene&apos;s proposal that we should use the 11 and 13<br/>accidentals for 20-tET, mainly because its 8:13 approximation is such<br/>a good one (within 0.5 cent).

If h5 and h7 are the &quot;standard&quot; vals mapping to the nearest integer for the various primes, and v5,v7,v11,v13,v17 and v19 are p-adic valuations, mapping p to 1 and every other prime to 0, then we may form the matrix of column vectors<br/>[h5,h7,v5,v7,v11,v13,v17,v19] and invert it, obtaining<br/>&lt;2187/2048,256/243,80/81,33/32,26/27,4131/4096,513/512&gt;.

That means we can&apos;t use 40-tET to get 20-tET,<br/>but must go to 60-tET which is also of course 5*12-tET. In that case<br/>we get the following notation for 20-tET, in which A-G,b,# are as for<br/>12-tET, and v^ are -+20 cents, &lt;&gt; are -+40 cents.</p><p>D<br/>Eb&lt;<br/>Eb^<br/>Ev<br/>E&gt;<br/>F<br/>F#&lt;<br/>F#^<br/>Gv<br/>G&gt;<br/>G#<br/>A&lt;<br/>A^<br/>Bbv<br/>Bb&gt;<br/>B<br/>C&lt;<br/>C^<br/>C#v<br/>C#&gt;<br/>D</p><p>------------------------ Yahoo!

What about using some other 3-5 commas<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Rapoport does, like the diesis 125:128 or diaschisma, 2025:2048?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now you&apos;re contradicting what I thought was one of the criteria,<br/>&gt; rather than the other way around. Isn&apos;t it desirable to have a<br/>unique<br/>&gt; spelling for JI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm. Yes it is desirable. But that means strictly one comma (and<br/>hence<br/>&gt; one pair of accidentals) per prime. So this is pushing me to accept<br/>&gt; that some low number ETs may use some high prime accidentals which<br/>are<br/>&gt; really meaningless in terms of actual usable approximations, but<br/>&gt; merely fill in the gaps left by the meaningful primes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m starting to come around to this, since I don&apos;t like the<br/>&gt; alternative chosen by Rapoport. He uses symbols to represent 1/n of<br/>&gt; his commas where n can be different for different ETs (typically n<br/>= 2<br/>&gt; or 3). So they essentially act as symbols representing a single<br/>step<br/>&gt; of the ET, something which, it seems to me, we should avoid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m curious as to what George Secor proposes to do about these. So<br/>far<br/>&gt; George, you&apos;ve been notating the easy ones. How does your<br/>notational<br/>&gt; semantics handle 20,25,27,28,30,32,37,42,44-tET. In most of these<br/>the<br/>&gt; septimal comma vanishes and the syntonic comma and undecimal diesis<br/>&gt; are the same size (1 or 2 steps) and the apotome (size of sharp or<br/>&gt; flat) is 4 to 7 steps and is equal to, or nearly equal to, the size<br/>of<br/>&gt; the whole tone (8:9). And so e.g. C# is way higher than Db and<br/>&gt; therefore sharps and flats are next to useless if we wish to have<br/>&gt; letters monotonic with pitch.</p><p>So I&apos;m notating the *easy* ones, huh?  I thought I was notating the<br/>*good* ones.  I threw systems like these into my microtonal garbage<br/>can during the first week or so that I spent investigating<br/>microtonality (yes, rejected without a hearing, late in 1963), and<br/>since that time I have never even entertained the thought of making a<br/>trip to the microtonal junkyard to reclaim them.  And I can&apos;t imagine<br/>that the rest of the world might beat a path to anyone&apos;s door because<br/>of any music made in them, either.</p><p>If I seem a bit narrow-minded by your standards, please understand<br/>that I would rather invest my time and effort in those directions<br/>that are most likely to have an impact on the non-microtonal world.</p><p>So in answer to your question: absolutely nothing!</p><p>--George</p><p>(Gee, answering that one was fun!

The solution I was using<br/>then was to notate everything in 144-EDO--why? Because I felt that if<br/>performers could handle the Sims-Maneri 72 glyphs, then they could<br/>probably handle the same glyphs with the simple addition of a<br/>crosshatch as well. To my mind, 144-EDO would accurately approximate<br/>every equal tuning that I was interested in as I felt 72-EDO was too<br/>coarse. So 144-EDO was a notational tuning, and not so much a tuning<br/>of special interest because of any acoustic property relative to JI,<br/>such as 72-tet. To these ends, I still think this works very<br/>effectively--I think the route you and George and Gene and Manuel (et<br/>al) are taking is a more sophisticated shoehorn, but a shoehorn it<br/>still is!</p><p>Here&apos;s the 22 out of 72 notation (where P = 600&iuml;&iquest;&half;):</p><p> 5   4   9  13<br/>--, --, --, --, ...<br/>14  11  25  36</p><p>C Db] Db^ D&lt; D^ Eb&lt; Eb&gt; EV E&gt; Fv F[</p><p>BTW, 11-tet has a sweet and useful side without having to resort to<br/>using it with a special inharmonic timbre or maximizing dissonance.<br/>I&apos;ve got one piece which I&apos;m extremely happy with in 11-tet that I<br/>will get somebody to convert to mp3 for me one of these days. It&apos;s<br/>melodic and pretty but with just enough spice to sound fresh. To my<br/>mind that&apos;s really the beauty of tunings like 11, 13 and 20-tet--the<br/>alien spicing of consonances, and not the maximizing of dissonances!<br/>Tunings like these made simple consonances not so simple and even<br/>interesting again (for these ears anyway).</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Saturday, February 16, 2002 9:50 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Notating ETs with one comma per prime</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Dave,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I see that your 20-tet notation is identical to the miracle one I<br/>&gt; &gt; posted yesterday.

To these ends, I still think this works very<br/>&gt; effectively--I think the route you and George and Gene and Manuel<br/>(et<br/>&gt; al) are taking is a more sophisticated shoehorn, but a shoehorn it<br/>&gt; still is!</p><p>This does seem like the best approach when knowing the deviations from<br/>12-tET is more important than knowing what ratios are approximated,<br/>and maybe that&apos;s all the time, when you&apos;re a performer.</p><p>And if the aim of a notation is to aid in JI-based composition or<br/>harmonic analysis, then I guess Graham and Paul are right that the<br/>best notation is one specific to the temperament, such as their<br/>10-nominal notations for miracle and paultone/pajara respectively.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s the 22 out of 72 notation (where P = 600&iuml;&iquest;&half;):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  5   4   9  13<br/>&gt; --, --, --, --, ...<br/>&gt; 14  11  25  36<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C Db] Db^ D&lt; D^ Eb&lt; Eb&gt; EV E&gt; Fv F[</p><p>Here&apos;s mine followed by how I assume yours would continue (correcting<br/>what I assume are some typos and changing Db to C#).

Wouldn&apos;t it<br/>give the same results? How do you decide when to use 144-EDO vs<br/>72-EDO?</p><p>&gt; BTW, 11-tet has a sweet and useful side without having to resort to<br/>&gt; using it with a special inharmonic timbre or maximizing dissonance.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve got one piece which I&apos;m extremely happy with in 11-tet that I<br/>&gt; will get somebody to convert to mp3 for me one of these days.</p><p>I look foward to hearing it.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s<br/>&gt; melodic and pretty but with just enough spice to sound fresh. To my<br/>&gt; mind that&apos;s really the beauty of tunings like 11, 13 and 20-tet--the<br/>&gt; alien spicing of consonances, and not the maximizing of dissonances!<br/>&gt; Tunings like these made simple consonances not so simple and even<br/>&gt; interesting again (for these ears anyway).</p><p>I think the results of our algorithm would be essentially identical to<br/>yours if we restricted the range of sizes we allow for our perfect<br/>fifths to a small range around 700 cents. I think we&apos;d have to limit<br/>them to plus or minus half a step of 144-EDO (+-4&amp;1/6 cents), or if<br/>you use 72-EDO then the allowable would be appprox +-8&amp;1/3. I&apos;ve<br/>proposed a range of approx -12.7 to +12.9 cents from 702.0 cents<br/>(2:3).</p><p>So, Paul Erlich, what problems do you see with Dan&apos;s, and my, proposed<br/>22-EDO notations?</p><p>------------------------ Yahoo!

And what about when they have a<br/>&gt; 1/n-octave period in association with some generator?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; then<br/>&gt; &gt; takes the resulting chain of generators and truncates it at<br/>whatever<br/>&gt; &gt; the equal tuning you&apos;re trying to notate is.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s a simple example, first in 72, then 144, using 5-tet:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 25   2  27  29<br/>&gt; &gt; --, --, --, --, ...<br/>&gt; &gt; 62   5  67  72<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      0<br/>&gt; &gt;  717   483<br/>&gt; &gt;  233   967<br/>&gt; &gt;  950   250<br/>&gt; &gt;  467   733<br/>&gt; &gt; 1183    17<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  27    1   28   29<br/>&gt; &gt; ---, ---, ---, ---, ...<br/>&gt; &gt; 134    5  139  144<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;      0<br/>&gt; &gt;  958   242<br/>&gt; &gt;  717   483<br/>&gt; &gt;  475   725<br/>&gt; &gt;  233   967<br/>&gt; &gt; 1192     8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you give me an example where this gives you a different result<br/>&gt; from simply rounding to the nearest 72 or 144 EDO note?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The symbols or glyphs are exist, Joe Monzo came up with an ascii<br/>&gt; &gt; adaptation of my Sims-Maneri 144-tet notation,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that&apos;s where I saw the tilde.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so all that&apos;s left is<br/>&gt; &gt; the correct letter spellings and a note naming scheme--at least<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; 144, I believe you yourself already devised one for 72-tet, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s where I&apos;ve already taken Paul Erlich and Joseph Pehrson to<br/>&gt; task previously. It&apos;s an interval naming scheme, not a note naming<br/>&gt; scheme. Note names are things like &quot;C sharp twelfth down&quot;. The two<br/>may<br/>&gt; be confused without too much pain in ETs, but not in MOS or other<br/>&gt; non-ET tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think of these ideas, and especially point me<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the direction of your 72-tet note naming scheme (a la Fokker&apos;s<br/>31),<br/>&gt; &gt; thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/MiracleIntervalNaming.txt">http://dkeenan.com/Music/Miracle/MiracleIntervalNaming.txt</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may prefer Paul Erlich&apos;s/Boston scheme where a (unqualified)<br/>major<br/>&gt; third is 400c rather than the best 4:5 approximation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

As I observed in my very first posting, life is<br/>&gt; &gt; short, and, we must establish our priorities for ourselves.<br/>&gt; &gt; Considering all of the music that has come out of the resources<br/>of a<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tone octave, I believe that those tonal systems that I have<br/>judged<br/>&gt; &gt; to be excellent would occupy me for many lifetimes, so that I<br/>have no<br/>&gt; &gt; need to concern myself with others that I perceive as less worthy<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; my time and effort.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you adopt that point of view, you need to be careful to do your<br/>discarding carefully. Given that 27 is one of the better 7-limit<br/>systems and 58 one of the relatively best systems for the 11, 13, 15<br/>and 17 limits (making it comparable to 31, 41, 46 or 72 and in some<br/>respects better) it is not clear you have. It could be you are<br/>confining yourself to the 11-limit, but I don&apos;t see why that should<br/>be, or it could be you are systematically underestimating the value<br/>of systems with a strong tendency for primes to map either to the<br/>flat or sharp side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You and your fellow &quot;Scavengers&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That appellation hardly applies to me, I don&apos;t know what others<br/>would think of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And so the very essence of discovery, innovation, and creativity<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; to see beauty or utility in those places where the rest of us<br/>pass<br/>&gt; &gt; by, unaware of the possibilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m simply doing the mundane math here.</p><p>Just so there are no hard feelings about this, I want to point out<br/>that sometimes a political, religious, or otherwise controversial<br/>movement will adopt a label given to it by its critics as a badge of<br/>honor, which is what I had in mind here.  And I do find myself in a<br/>rather inconsistent position on this one, since I had earlier stated<br/>that I believed that diversity is one of the strengths of our<br/>movement -- I just hadn&apos;t anticipated this much diversity.</p><p>Paul, Dave, &amp; Gene:  I have sought to include 27 &amp; 58-EDO in the<br/>sagittal notation by using the auxiliary symbols that I discarded<br/>earlier from the native 41-EDO notation.  See Figure 5 of:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/secor/notation/Figures.bmp">/tuning/files/secor/notation/Figures.bmp</a></p><p>For 58-EDO, at first I tried deleting 64:63 as a defining comma for<br/>the notation, which would then make the right-flag symbols (such as<br/>|\ and |/) alter by 55:54 (i.e., 33:32 less 81:80), so that EDO&apos;s in<br/>which 385:384 is maintained (such as 58) could be included (see line:<br/>Native 58-tone, version a).</p><p>But with the auxiliary symbols defined as in the lower right corner<br/>of the figure, 58 could be notated as in version b.  This would also<br/>make it possible to do 27-EDO, while providing another (and<br/>possibly &quot;cleaner&quot;) way to do 46 and 53 (for which I show versions a<br/>and b), while maintaining compatibility with the way I have used them<br/>for 96.  And this would probably open the door to notating some other<br/>EDO&apos;s as well.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=34624 href="#34624">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2002 1:37:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s hard for me to know what someone would want in an 11-tET<br/>notation<br/>&gt; , since I don&apos;t know why anyone would want to use 11-tET, except to<br/>&gt; maximise dissonance, or to use with a special inharmonic timbre.</p><p>Just for the record (Monz, take note!), I may possibly be the very<br/>first both to advocate and use 11-ET:</p><p>1) In an unpublished paper (April 1964) I advocated using it for<br/>atonal music:  Since it contains nothing that approximates a perfect<br/>fifth or major third, you have to go to extraordinary lengths to try<br/>to establish a key center.

This is<br/>far fewer than Rapoport&apos;s 5-limit system as used in Scala. This is<br/>because Rapoport needs all those 1/n-comma symbols.

A FULL ARROW<br/>with CURVED lines would indicate alteration by 26:27, while a RIGHT<br/>CURVED flag would indicate alteration by 63:64.  Left-right<br/>confusibility for the 72-EDO native notation could still be avoided<br/>by a carefully chosen selection from both the curved and straight-<br/>flag symbols.  (While it would also be possible to mix straight and<br/>curved flags in the same symbol, I would think very long and hard<br/>about this before doing it, even though it would present an<br/>additional alternative for theoretical or analytical purposes.)</p><p>&gt; We can have one consistent set of symbols for notating both JI and<br/>&gt; ETs. The previous sentence should probably be in flashing lights.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll say it again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * WE CAN HAVE ONE SMALL SET OF SYMBOLS FOR NOTATING BOTH JI AND ETS<br/>*</p><p>YES, YES, YES!!!</p><p>&gt; This seems like something we should have had a long time ago. Many<br/>&gt; thanks to Gene for pushing the idea.</p><p>Yes.  Thank you, Gene!</p><p>&gt; The beauty is, that with this choice of commas, there is no need to<br/>go<br/>&gt; past 19-limit for notating all the ETs of interest, well into the<br/>&gt; hundreds. 19-limit means we only need 6 new pairs of symbols. This<br/>is<br/>&gt; far fewer than Rapoport&apos;s 5-limit system as used in Scala. This is<br/>&gt; because Rapoport needs all those 1/n-comma symbols. Because the 17<br/>and<br/>&gt; 19 commas are so small, we don&apos;t need these 1-step symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These 17 and 19 commas just happen to step down in size from the<br/>&gt; syntonic and septimal comma in an almost perfect trinary system!:<br/>27c,<br/>&gt; 9c, 3c. To get the idea, notice how you can make up all the numbers<br/>&gt; from -13 to +13 just using combinations of 0,-1,+1,-3,+3,-9,+9<br/>without<br/>&gt; using more than 3 of them and never using any of them more than<br/>once.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13 = +9 +3 +1<br/>&gt; 12 = +9 +3<br/>&gt; 11 = +9 +3 -1<br/>&gt; 10 = +9 +1<br/>&gt;  9 = +9<br/>&gt;  8 = +9 -1<br/>&gt;  7 = +9 -3 +1<br/>&gt;  6 = +9 -3<br/>&gt;  5 = +9 -3 -1<br/>&gt;  4 = +3 +1<br/>&gt;  3 = +3<br/>&gt;  2 = +3 -1<br/>&gt;  1 = +1<br/>&gt;  0<br/>&gt; and so on.</p><p>Very impressive!</p><p>&gt; The commas are also chosen so they vanish in 12-tET. In JI a<br/>complete<br/>&gt; 19-limit otonality on G would be spelled<br/>&gt; G:D:Bv:F&lt;:A:C]:Eb}:F#v:G#j:Bbh<br/>&gt; 1:3:5 :7 :9:11:13 :15 :17 :19<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice that, sans commas, the above all fall within a chain of<br/>fifths<br/>&gt; from Eb to G# and no note is repeated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To get the best approximation of that chord in _any_ ET you would<br/>just<br/>&gt; omit the symbols for any commas that vanish in that ET, and replace<br/>&gt; any symbols for higher primes with those of lower primes that<br/>&gt; correspond to the same number of steps. And sometimes we may use<br/>&gt; _pairs_ of symbols for lower primes in place of those for a higher<br/>&gt; prime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, in 12-tET the best approximation (athough not a usable<br/>or<br/>&gt; recognisable approximation) of that complete 19-limit otonality  is<br/>&gt; notated as.<br/>&gt; G:D:B:F:A:C:Eb:F#:G#:Bb<br/>&gt; We simply dropped all the comma symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is not such a system very much worth having????????????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan</p><p>YES!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=34917 href="#34917">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/2002 1:56:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi George,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I wouldn&apos;t want to sound disrespectful to anyone who was<br/>&gt; discussing 11-tet before I was born!, I must take umbrage with some<br/>of<br/>&gt; what you&apos;ve written here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the &quot;it&apos;s so bad that it&apos;s good&quot; argument for atonality that<br/>&gt; you make for 11-tet, the very same one that is often made for 13-<br/>tet,<br/>&gt; is, simply put, wrong and overly simplistic.

I consider 8:13 to be a narrow neutral sixth (11:18 being the<br/>ordinary one). Ask yourself, is it more like a kind of C:Ab or a kind<br/>of C:A; more like a kind of A:F or a kind of A:F#.

And so 26:27<br/>&gt; does not disappear in either 12-tET or a true Pythagorean chain. It<br/>&gt; maps to a sharp or flat in both these systems. You could notate<br/>26:27<br/>&gt; as pairs like &quot;b}&quot; and &quot;#{&quot;, but this could lead to ugly things<br/>like<br/>&gt; F#b}. I consider 8:13 to be a narrow neutral sixth (11:18 being the<br/>&gt; ordinary one). Ask yourself, is it more like a kind of C:Ab or a<br/>kind<br/>&gt; of C:A; more like a kind of A:F or a kind of A:F#. Based purely on<br/>&gt; distance in cents the answer in both 12-tET and Pythagorean is<br/>C:Eb}<br/>&gt; and A:F{.</p><p>It depends on the context.  I hear 8:11 primarily as an augmented<br/>fourth (rather than a perfect fourth), and when the 8:11:13 is<br/>sounded, the 13 will sound more like an A than an A-flat.  (I noticed<br/>that Paul Erlich said something to this effect in his reply.)<br/>Anyway, this is beside the point, in light of what I have to say<br/>below.</p><p>&gt; We have enough large commas already in the 11-limit. To notate as<br/>many<br/>&gt; ETs as possible without going too far up the primes, we need<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; commas, not larger. With the choice I&apos;ve given, I&apos;ve noticed that<br/>11<br/>&gt; and 13 commas are rarely needed together, in case that&apos;s relevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have a specific reason for<br/>&gt; &gt; asking this: I have an idea for the sagittal symbols that would<br/>&gt; &gt; notate primes 7 and 13 in combination (with curved flags).  Only<br/>&gt; &gt; primes 5 and 11 (and NOT 7) would be notated by the straight<br/>flags<br/>&gt; &gt; (/ and \).  The curved flags would not show up in the native<br/>notations<br/>&gt; &gt; for the simpler EDO&apos;s, such as 17, 22, 24, 31, and 41.  A FULL<br/>ARROW<br/>&gt; &gt; with CURVED lines would indicate alteration by 26:27, while a<br/>RIGHT<br/>&gt; &gt; CURVED flag would indicate alteration by 63:64.  Left-right<br/>&gt; &gt; confusibility for the 72-EDO native notation could still be<br/>avoided<br/>&gt; &gt; by a carefully chosen selection from both the curved and straight-<br/>&gt; &gt; flag symbols.  (While it would also be possible to mix straight<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; curved flags in the same symbol, I would think very long and hard<br/>&gt; &gt; about this before doing it, even though it would present an<br/>&gt; &gt; additional alternative for theoretical or analytical purposes.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m hoping you can come up with an alternative that can use the<br/>&gt; 1024:1053.</p><p>As it turns out, neither variation of the approach that I am now<br/>taking pairs the 7 and 13 factors together, and the one that looks<br/>most promising at the moment requires all defining commas to be no<br/>more than half of an apotome, so it *must* use 1024:1053 instead of<br/>26:27.</p><p>&gt; If you&apos;re still planning to assume that certain very small commas<br/>&gt; vanish (so certain combinations of the prime-commas never occur)<br/>then<br/>&gt; they had better be very small (like 1 cent or less) to keep the JI<br/>&gt; folks happy.</p><p>I was wondering whether you had a particular comma in mind when you<br/>said this, because a very useful one that I found is around 0.4 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... These 17 and 19 commas just happen to step down in size<br/>from the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; syntonic and septimal comma in an almost perfect trinary<br/>system!: 27c,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 9c, 3c. To get the idea, notice how you can make up all the<br/>numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; from -13 to +13 just using combinations of 0,-1,+1,-3,+3,-9,+9<br/>without<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; using more than 3 of them and never using any of them more than<br/>once.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Except that as Manuel pointed out, it&apos;s considered bad form to<br/>combine<br/>&gt; an up accidental with a down.
