Congrats on a great start.  I&apos;ve always enjoyed your<br/>music, but this piece seems to even have a greater sophistication<br/>than they &quot;generally&quot; do...  Could it be the scale?  It seems quite<br/>incredibly fraught with possibilities... to *me* anyway.</p><p>_________ _______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=24292 href="#24292">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2001 6:16:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>Herman usually makes very Blackwood-like use of the tuning resources<br/>he uses -- i.e., extended or warped melodic and tonal use in the<br/>conventional tradition. Plus he&apos;s got a good ear for timbre and<br/>orchestrational colors too (much better than Blackwood in that regard<br/>I think), so if it ain&apos;t GM (and even his GM ain&apos;t half bad) it always<br/>sounds good as well.</p><p>When the whole &quot;miracle&quot; thread started I thought Herman was one of<br/>the guys on this list who might make (good) use of its resources in<br/>something like the way Paul and Dave K. framed the deal.</p><p>Anyway, you might want to check out some of his other stuff again with<br/>that in mind.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
