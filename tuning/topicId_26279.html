And not all sequencers<br/>support editing so if it is the only access into your<br/>plugin, there is that limitation. But I think it might<br/>be reasonable to say that most people who would be<br/>advanced enough to use your plugin/blackbox/whatever<br/>would be capable of figuring it out.</p><p>In Cubase, you can set up MIDI Mixer Maps. These are<br/>sliders and knobs and buttons which you can assign to<br/>just about any kind of MIDI message -- CC, [N]RPNs and<br/>sysex are three possibilities I use these things for.</p><p>Then you can use the sliders during sequencing ad even<br/>graphically edit the curves you have, etc. The latest<br/>versions of this feature are not as good as the<br/>original version that was an the Atari but it&apos;s still<br/>quite workable. So far, Cubase of all sequencers has<br/>the best abilities in this field that I&apos;ve seen. It is<br/>certainly not perfect but is workable and extremely<br/>useful to me as a composer.</p><p>Perhaps others can catalogue their own experiences with<br/>the sequencers they favor.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>7/17/2001 2:09:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff wrote:</p><p>&gt; Perhaps others can catalogue their own experiences with<br/>&gt; the sequencers they favor.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about sequencers, but SysEx are a PITA to work with using the<br/>Windows API.  The problem is they&apos;re a different format to other messages,<br/>not fitting 3 bytes, and so have to be treated differently.  I never did<br/>work it out from the documentation, but do now have a book telling me how<br/>to do it.</p><p>Even using raw streams or files, SysEx messages need that bit extra work<br/>to get right, so it&apos;s convenient if you can ignore them.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
