Where have you been? We&apos;ve certainly discussed microtemperaments<br/>&gt;in relation to JI here before.</p><p>I guess I&apos;ve been skimming.

If I want a 7/6, I can just write it.  No problem.</p><p>If you&apos;re dealing with a fixed tuning on an instrument. . .well, that&apos;s in<br/>some ways more problematic, but in other ways much more interesting.  It<br/>had never really occured to me that one would become &quot;obssessed with the<br/>far reaches of  one&apos;s tuning&quot; (as Kraig put it),  but now, of course it<br/>seems like an obvious thing that would happen.</p><p>In fact, as a composer, I very much enjoy the idea of setting up a<br/>pre-compositional construct, and then FORGETTING about how I made it, what<br/>properties it is supposed to have, etc.  and just exploring it<br/>intuitively.    Then, of course, emergent properties that may or may not<br/>have been predicted arise.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But of course that&apos;s silly, if you&apos;ve got, say 43 tones per<br/>&gt;&gt; octave, you&apos;re bound to be able to approximate a lot of things very<br/>&gt;&gt;well.</p><p>&gt;Try 45 tones of ennealimmal and you can change that to very, very well.</p><p>What is that, briefly?  (Or point me to a post. . . )</p><p>I was thinking of Partch&apos;s scale, and somewhere he says something like,<br/>&quot;in the worst case scenario, with 43 tones per octave, you&apos;ve got any<br/>intervals approximated to at least ___ cents.&quot;</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3><a id=43686 href="#43686">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2003 4:04:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I guess I&apos;ve been skimming.

(Or point me to a post. . . )</p><p>One way to do it is to divide the octave into equal 612 parts, and<br/>then repeat the step pattern 7, 18, 7, 18, 18 nine times, giving 45<br/>notes to the octave. Here the 18 splits the difference between 49/48<br/>and 50/49, while the 7 serves as a 126/125, 245/243, 1728/1715 and<br/>4000/3969, all of which you may recognize as 7-limit commas, and which<br/>are all about the same size of 13-14 cents. The result is a scale<br/>which approximates 7-limit just intonation to extreme accuracy, while<br/>making use of the microcommas 2401/2400 and 4375/4374 to greatly<br/>expand the harmonic possibilities.</p></div><h3><a id=43691 href="#43691">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2003 8:53:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve had two computer disasters lately; I owe two people a CD but I<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t recall who they were and didn&apos;t have an address.
