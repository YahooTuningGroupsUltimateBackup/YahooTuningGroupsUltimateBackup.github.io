As this is regarded by the prevailing opinion of the<br/>majority (outside this list) a too big step for &quot;leading tone&quot; the third<br/>is usually raised - the amount, how much it is raised, practically being<br/>undefined. In practice this might lead to thirds (on the &quot;dominant&quot; or<br/>V-th grade) which are much closer to a diminished fourth than a third.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; If Gesualdo were using 19 pitch classes, ...</p><p>&gt; &gt; ... we cannot assume that they narrowed leading tones since a discant<br/>&gt; &gt; clause, where tyhe leading note would occur, would be the large semitone<br/>&gt; &gt; (16:15) resp. it&apos;s meantone approximation.</p><p>&gt; Why can&apos;t we assume that?</p><p>I explained that, just after the &quot;since&quot; (maybe I should have written<br/>&quot;because&quot; - my English is not that good, sorry)</p><p>&gt;  What does &quot;discant clause&quot; mean?</p><p>[This was explained later by Margo Schulter ...]</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would expect him to use dissonances in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; manner outlined above to give motion by minor semitones.

I&apos;m not sure he ever used more than 12 pitches (as<br/>&gt; written) in a piece although he may have used as many as 20.  I haven&apos;t counted.<br/>&gt; But what&apos;s its relevance?</p><p>Again I refer to Mrs. Schulter&apos;s mail(s)</p><p>May be an example: If he used different pitches as sometimes represented<br/>by split keys in instruments (for Gesualdo you might extend this to Gb<br/>on the flat-side and to B# on the sharp side)</p><p>       - D#<br/>        / \<br/>     - B - F#- C#- G# -<br/>      / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>   - G - D - A - E -<br/>    / \ / \ / \ / \<br/> - Eb- Bb- F - C -<br/>            \ / \<br/>             Ab-</p><p>Here the dashes indicate<br/>- meantone fifths<br/>/ pure major thirds<br/>\ minor thirds (as defined by the two previous)</p><p>Here you have 14 distinctive pitches, because for example G# and Ab (and<br/>Eb and D# as well) are two different pitches, separated by the smaller<br/>di&iuml;&iquest;&half;sis (of 41 ct or ~1/5 tone). The Ab cannot be used as a G# or vice<br/>versa (as in 12-ET).<br/>Therefore you have 14 pitch classes.<br/>I think Margo Schulter has made this point clear in one of her following mails.</p><p>&gt; &gt; - he would have used the terminology of his time, one aspect of which<br/>&gt; &gt;   might be describable with the modern X-limit-concept.</p><p>&gt; That looks obviously true to me.  So is it still what you don&apos;t regard as right?</p><p>&gt; &gt; * the modern concept of pitch class doesn&apos;t add anything to the argument</p><p>&gt; You obviously have a low opinion of my argument, because it would fall to the<br/>&gt; ground immediately without the idea of pitch classes.</p><p>I haven&apos;t a low opinion of you, but I think your argument really misses<br/>the point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; He did use dissonance, and a lot of chromaticism,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so what I&apos;ve seen so far strongly suggests 12 pitch classes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; While the first part of the previous sentence is undoubted,<br/>&gt; &gt; the second is wrong conlusion:<br/>&gt; &gt; If a piece has no more than twelve pitches then you are right, but what<br/>&gt; &gt; if it makes use of g# and a-flat, which are in any case distinct pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; in G&apos;s time?</p><p>&gt; Same pitch class.</p><p>different pitch classes, since they are not interchangable ...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve thought about how this argument should be phrased:  Gesualdo&apos;s music only<br/>&gt; requires 12 pitch classes.</p><p>we don&apos;t need to take this up again and again, as has been stated in<br/>many mails now that it requires more - .<br/>May I ask you, whether you have ever heard 16th/17th-century-music on an<br/>instrument with split keys? I think that experience would help a lot in understanding.</p><p>&gt; That means, if you represent the music using 12 pitch classes, it can be converted<br/>&gt; to the staff (and therefore meantone) exactly as Gesualdo did if you follow these<br/>&gt; rules, in order, 1 being the most important:</p><p>...</p><p>Talking of &quot;split-key&quot;-keyboards</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; but only to allow greater range of modulation.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They weren&apos;t exploiting the new sonorities those split keys gave them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They were exploiting them within the frame that the music theory of the<br/>&gt; &gt; time would allow - I regard that as the same degree of exploitation,<br/>&gt; &gt; like Bach exploited the sonmorities which the rising well-tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings offered.</p><p>&gt; Before you quoted &quot;Music came first; then the scales ... then came the theorists to<br/>&gt; explain them.&quot;  And you half agreed with it.  Now you&apos;re saying composers are<br/>&gt; constrained by theory?  I disagree!</p><p>I&apos;d disagree with myself if I had said that. Where did I say that?</p><p>&gt; But anyway, it&apos;s as much the practice of the time as Gesualdo in particular that<br/>&gt; I&apos;m interested in.  Gesualdo happens to be a prominent example of a highly<br/>&gt; chromatic composer who may have encountered split-key keyboards.</p><p>We know, he had ... as much as we can trust the sources, of course. read<br/>again Bill Alves quote from the Grove&apos;s article by Lorenzo Bianconi.<br/>see Alves&apos;s posting to the list:<br/>  Date: Fri, 23 Feb 2001 13:46:23 -0800<br/>  From: Bill Alves &lt;<a href="mailto:ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU">ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU</a>&gt;<br/>  Subject: Re: Re: Gesualdo (Part I of II)</p><p>-----------------------------</p><p>&gt;    Date: Fri, 23 Feb 2001 22:55:30 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Gesualdo / intonation / Meantone / FAQ</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Ibo Ortgies &lt;ibo.ortgies@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; just a question here, why isn&apos;t 53-ET adressed, basically a<br/>&gt; &gt; extension of pythagorean tuning<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a very odd question, Ibo.

And would we regard the mere possibility as enough<br/>reason to couple it to his still existing music?<br/>Right now we can only say that Handel and his music did exist at the<br/>same time as the Smith-organ (with 14 keys/octave) - anything more is an<br/>assumption until we discover a source relating this organ to Handel and<br/>maybe even his music (at least one piece).  Also we could think that an<br/>organ with a shifting mechanism existed before the instruments we know<br/>of, which were built after Handel&apos;s death - we could, but we don&apos;t have<br/>enough evidence to state it as a undoubtable fact.<br/>This still leaves us the possibility to think that Handel&apos;s music fits<br/>well for meantone-tuning and a extended-meantone-instrument would help<br/>in performance probably a lot.</p><p>----------------------</p><p>&gt;    Date: Fri, 23 Feb 2001 23:40:32 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Gesualdo / intonation / Meantone / FAQ</p><p>&gt; Ibo Ortgies &lt;ibo.ortgies@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; and G.F.H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ndel owned instruments with 14 and 16 keys per<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; octave.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ....- perhaps search the archives for<br/>&gt; &gt; I couldn&apos;t find it, I tried keywords Handel,<br/>&gt; Anyway, the relevant messages are numbers:<br/>&gt; 7516</p><p>Thanks for the help and ..<br/>...<br/>&gt; &gt; H&iuml;&iquest;&half;ndel, Handel + Ehrlich ...<br/>&gt; Spelling my name right might help . . .</p><p>...I apologize for that misspelling!</p><p>------------------------</p><p>&gt;    Date: Fri, 23 Feb 2001 18:52:14 -0800 (PST)<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;M.

What I said was, roughly,</p><p>IF<br/>  19 pitch classes<br/>AND<br/>  minor semitones good<br/>AND<br/>  dissonance<br/>THEN<br/>  dissonance used to give minor semitones</p><p>So I was looking for examples of gratuitous use of minor semitones to<br/>support the hypothesis I was investigating.  If this argument is<br/>correct (it makes sense to me) and Gesualdo did use dissonance (we&apos;re<br/>agreed on that) but he didn&apos;t use it to give minor semitones, then it<br/>would follow that either he wasn&apos;t freely using 19 pitch classes or he<br/>didn&apos;t favour minor semitones.</p><p>So I wasn&apos;t expecting to find these kind of minor semitones.  I was<br/>looking for them to see if the hypothesis was true.  And I was<br/>assuming the hypothesis in order to prove or disprove it.  After that,<br/>I looked for the evidence.</p><p>If I could prove he was using 19 pitch classes, and not using<br/>dissonance to bring out minor semitones, that would prove that he<br/>didn&apos;t favour minor semitones.  In fact, I can&apos;t prove he used more<br/>than 12 pitch classes, so the use of minor semitones is still an open<br/>question.</p><p>There is that one passage where I think he was specifically rigging<br/>the harmony to get minor semitones.  But the motive was specific to<br/>that context, and not general to his work.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  The word &quot;then&quot; means I&apos;m not sure what<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, my bad English. I&apos;m sorry that it contributes to our dispute<br/>...<br/>&gt; maybe &quot;If it is so, why would you expect it&quot; would have been the<br/>right<br/>&gt; way to ask?</p><p>And the answer is, I assumed it first, and then looked to see if it<br/>was true.  I don&apos;t expect anything without evidence.</p><p>&gt; [Daniel Wolf made a very polite and good statement about the use of<br/>a<br/>&gt; foreign language]</p><p>In fact, your English is so good, I didn&apos;t realize you weren&apos;t a<br/>native speaker, or at least a long-time resident in an English<br/>speaking country.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing of this I regard as right</p><p>&gt; Here you have 14 distinctive pitches, because for example G# and Ab<br/>(and<br/>&gt; Eb and D# as well) are two different pitches, separated by the<br/>smaller<br/>&gt; di&euml;sis (of 41 ct or ~1/5 tone). The Ab cannot be used as a G# or<br/>vice<br/>&gt; versa (as in 12-ET).<br/>&gt; Therefore you have 14 pitch classes.<br/>&gt; I think Margo Schulter has made this point clear in one of her<br/>following mails.</p><p>My understanding of the term &quot;pitch class&quot; is that it is an abstract<br/>idea that can represent a number of pitches.  So an &quot;F&quot; on the page<br/>may not always be sung at the same pitch, but is a single pitch class.<br/> Traditional notation can be thought of as using 12 pitch classes,<br/>where C#=Db, D#=Eb, etc.</p><p>I don&apos;t have the reference to hand, it was a long time ago that I read<br/>it, but at that time I didn&apos;t see any inconsistency in analysing<br/>meantone music using such a system.  And it seems to be appropriate<br/>for Gesualdo.  His compositions can be expressed in 12 pitch classes,<br/>and mechanically converted into a higher number of pitches with very<br/>few discrepancies.  He wrote more than 12 pitches, but only 12 pitch<br/>classes are required to analyse the overwhelming majority of his<br/>music.</p><p>However, I don&apos;t believe you could devise an algorithm that could<br/>restore the music after all accidentals were removed.  Which means you<br/>need more than 7 pitch classes to represent the music.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; While the first part of the previous sentence is undoubted,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the second is wrong conlusion:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If a piece has no more than twelve pitches then you are right,<br/>but what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if it makes use of g# and a-flat, which are in any case distinct<br/>pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in G&apos;s time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Same pitch class.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; different pitch classes, since they are not interchangable ...</p><p>I know of no music, tonal or free atonal or serial, in which there are<br/>no rules governing whether G# should be preferred over Ab.  If the<br/>idea of 12 pitch classes is to make any sense when applied to these<br/>musics, it must mean something like what I think it means.  If not,<br/>let&apos;s reformulate the idea so it does mean something.  Or find me a<br/>different term for what I&apos;m trying to express.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve thought about how this argument should be phrased:<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s music only<br/>&gt; &gt; requires 12 pitch classes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; we don&apos;t need to take this up again and again, as has been stated in<br/>&gt; many mails now that it requires more - .</p><p>I&apos;ve given objective criteria by which my assertion can be disproved.<br/> I can even give you the source code so you can run the tests<br/>yourself.  You can say as often as you like that I&apos;m wrong, but I<br/>won&apos;t believe you until you prove it.</p><p>Nothing anybody has said contradicts my idea, which may mean nobody<br/>understands it and I&apos;m not expressing myself well enough.  But then<br/>you must think you understand it to say it&apos;s wrong.  To me, it seems<br/>obvious in the light of the evidence.</p><p>&gt; May I ask you, whether you have ever heard 16th/17th-century-music<br/>on an<br/>&gt; instrument with split keys? I think that experience would help a lot<br/>in understanding.</p><p>No.  I&apos;m going by the score.  I can tune a keyboard to an extended<br/>mapping, but it would be difficult to get the voicing right.  I also<br/>have a guitar with the right fretting but, again, it&apos;s not really<br/>suitable for playing a madrigal on.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; They were exploiting them within the frame that the music theory<br/>of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; time would allow - I regard that as the same degree of<br/>exploitation,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like Bach exploited the sonmorities which the rising<br/>well-tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tunings offered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Before you quoted &quot;Music came first; then the scales ... then came<br/>the theorists to<br/>&gt; &gt; explain them.&quot;  And you half agreed with it.  Now you&apos;re saying<br/>composers are<br/>&gt; &gt; constrained by theory?  I disagree!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d disagree with myself if I had said that. Where did I say that?</p><p>Maybe this is getting pedantic.  But when you say &quot;within the frame<br/>that music theory of the time would allow&quot; it seems like the theory is<br/>not allowing some things to be done.</p><p>        Graham</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/27/2001 10:58:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Ibo Ortgies &lt;ibo.ortgies@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It might be worth looking at singing and playing teaching books<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the meantone era and even later.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the eighteenth century Mattheson,  ...etc. refer still to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just intervals like 5:4, 9:8, 16:15 these were books to train<br/>and to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; practice with.<br/>&gt; &gt; 5:4 certainly is fine as a harmonic interval, but as for melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; seconds, there were no reliable means of producing such ratios<br/>except<br/>&gt; &gt; special tools such as the monochord, so they must be regarded as<br/>&gt; &gt; irrelevant to any actual training that may have taken place<br/>(unless<br/>&gt; &gt; monochords where a major part of musician training . . . ?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think these writers (and many others) were also very experienced<br/>&gt; practitioners and wrote for the performing musician.
