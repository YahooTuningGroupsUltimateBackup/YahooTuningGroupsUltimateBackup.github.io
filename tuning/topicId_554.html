For instance, the 18th variation of Rachmaninov&apos;s<br/>&quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; transposes A minor to D-flat major. The<br/>intervals remain the same size, but they are rearranged from top to bottom.<br/>A 16-tet scale can be arranged to play diatonic melodies with minor thirds<br/>in place of major ones and vice versa. Now imagine combining these two<br/>effects. You could have an inversion of a melody that has the same<br/>alternation of major and minor as the original version, but in a different<br/>tuning. This would be an interesting phenomenon to explore in a composition<br/>that alternates between two or more different tunings (16 - 19 - 23 - 26?).</p><p>Has anyone used this effect in their music? Would it even work? It looks<br/>fine on paper, and I did a couple of tests in Cakewalk with simple<br/>melodies. I suppose I&apos;ll have to tune an inverted 16-tet scale on my DX7II<br/>to find out if it works with more elaborate music.</p></div>
