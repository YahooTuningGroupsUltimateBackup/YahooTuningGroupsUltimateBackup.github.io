You know<br/>how they say there are many levels to Mozart, for the many different people<br/>that there are?  Well Bach has different dimensions that can be revealed<br/>through tuning.  The tuning pushes the lines apart from each other so that<br/>each has its own terrain (further supporting the no crossing voices<br/>prohibition).  Certain chromatics are really chromatic - as in colorful.  The<br/>flat C# at 90 cents turns melodies towards romantic expression due to its<br/>inherent contrariness to resolving.</p><p>I think that it is possible to imagine differently in order to understand<br/>performance practice as it pertains to culture, but hearing it is definitely<br/>a good first step.

The key of F major sounds quite just, while<br/>the key of D major sounds very strange to me -- perhaps the strangest<br/>of all.</p></div>
