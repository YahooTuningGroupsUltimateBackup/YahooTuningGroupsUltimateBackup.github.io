Someone named Rudolph Haase wrote three chapters in it on<br/>Keplers World Harmony. Somewhat flaky, but interesting. Somwhere buried in<br/>the mathematical discussion are stements such as &apos;Most important is the<br/>realisation that the events of the world are governed by a plan, and that<br/>this plan is recognisable even when the events appear as incomprehensible<br/>and harmful ... this makes it clear that the proper way of thinking for<br/>our world is a finalistic one, whereas natural scientific thinking,<br/>necessarily causally oriented, can only conceive of the world in a partial<br/>manner.&apos;</p><p>There was a letter to the editor of the New York Times last Sunday,<br/>complaining about a review of Bach recordings which said &apos;Bach transcended<br/>the limitations imposed by his religious faith&apos; or some such thing. &apos;Art<br/>tinged with dogma starts out at a disadvantage&apos;, I think is a quote.

In<br/>fact many of the aspects between planets were introduced by him. He wrote<br/>over 200 books on astrology most of which access is denied. He showed how<br/>the periods of revolutions did not follow a plan as you said. He goes on<br/>though to see the distances as being related via the enclosure of one<br/>platonic solid inside another. This was an attempt to solve the harmony of<br/>the spheres question as stated by  Ptolemy. That these relations are more<br/>in the family of irrational numbers. We understand now why this would have<br/>to be the case or certain repeating resonances would destroy  the orbit of<br/>one if not all of the planets.Still it does not diminish my admiration of<br/>his attempt to preserve the sentiments and concerns of the astronomer who<br/>work would take 1500 years before it would be updated.</p><p>&gt; In any case, there are no particular ratios between planets specified<br/>&gt; here, as one can put the planets at any arbitrary set of distances from<br/>&gt; the sun and they will still follow Kepler&apos;s laws.</p><p>Somehow you have not read the same document as me. Its filled with ratios<br/>and notes even. In fact, I use the text in a performance a few years ago.<br/>Various instruments scattered in an outdoor hallway near a coffee shop. A 4<br/>way conjunction was in the sky. Each instrument had a rhythm pattern that<br/>reflected its rotation period. Kepler stood on a soapbox and was preaching<br/>this as people walked by or stood and listened. As most raving, no one<br/>could follow him. The truth sometimes come in such form.<br/>    BTW have you played any of his temperments. I have never had the chance<br/>but always suspected that their might be more to them that meets the eye.<br/>    My interest in alot of this is to understand why the ancients chose the<br/>ratios they did. It is apart of our tuning history that our roots are in<br/>sacred geometry. If Art has become as Mircea Eliade pointed out&quot; the<br/>secularization of sacred objects&quot;, what is this.
