Many proper P may<br/>&#x9;satisfy this requirement.  If the stimuli are sufficiently unfamiliar<br/>&#x9;(as when one listens to music of an alien culture) many repeated &#x9;hearings<br/>may be necessary during which a listener replaces a familiar &#x9;P with one<br/>more appropriate for classifying the stimuli heard.  The &#x9;cardinality of<br/>the constructed P will depend upon the numbers of &#x9;distinctions required by<br/>the particular musical language or, if the &#x9;stimuli are not musical, upon<br/>the fineness of discrimination required &#x9;by the recognition task to be<br/>performed.</p><p>Once an appropriate P has been found, the next step is to locate a stimulus<br/>within it...</p><p>&#x9;Given any &quot;interval&quot; (pair) in P, the listener is able to recognize &#x9;the<br/>possible positions its elements might occupy in P.  In effect, &#x9;given any<br/>pair of elements he can mentally supply (interpolate) a &#x9;possible set of<br/>remaining elements of P which satisfy the equivalence &#x9;class and tuning he<br/>has learned.  Such an interpolation becomes unique &#x9;after a sufficient<br/>number of elements of P are heard.  This is &#x9;equivalent to the<br/>identification of x (key) in a give P(x).</p><p>&#x9;For example, the major triad [C E G] is not a sufficient subset of the<br/>C-major scale since there are two other major scales (namely G and F) &#x9;in<br/>which it occurs.  But C-major is the only major scale which &#x9;contains the<br/>four notes [G B D F], so the &quot;dominant seventh chord&quot; is &#x9;a sufficient<br/>subset of C-major.  A minimal set is a sufficient set &#x9;with no sufficient<br/>subsets.  Thus, [G B D F] is not a minimal set, but &#x9;[G B F] is, as there<br/>is no major scale except C which contains [G B &#x9;F], while each of its<br/>proper subsets [G B] [G F] [B F] are included in &#x9;some other major scale<br/>(G, F, and F# respectively).</p><p>&#x9;It is straightforward to verify that sufficient (and therefore &#x9;minimal)<br/>sets are invariants of equivalence.  They depend only on the &#x9;equivalence<br/>class, not on the particular tuning.</p><p>A measure is developed for this locating...</p><p>&#x9;Consider a language whose alphabet consists of n letters (or &#x9;phonemes).<br/>How many distinct words can be formed using this &#x9;alphabet?  Certain<br/>restrictions may exist which can limit the<br/>&#x9;sequences of letters that can occur.  The more distinct words that can &#x9;be<br/>formed whose length is less than or equal to some maximal value, &#x9;the more<br/>efficient the alphabet is said to be.</p><p>&#x9;A similar situation applies when &quot;words&quot; are formed from sequences of<br/>intervals.  Since interval sequences are formed from tone sequences, &#x9;we<br/>consider sequences of the elements of some P.  Also, since no new<br/>intervals are formed when an element is repeated, only non-repeating<br/>sequences will be considered.  Since we are here concerned only with<br/>properties deriving from the structure of P, we will use the following<br/>criterion for the termination of a &quot;word&quot; (other criteria apply when<br/>&quot;motifs&quot; are considered): When all remaining elements of P are &#x9;determined<br/>by a sequence of some of its elements, the addition of &#x9;elements will<br/>impart no further information of this type, and the &#x9;&quot;word&quot; will be<br/>considered terminated.  That is, any sequence will be &#x9;considered complete<br/>as soon as a sufficient set occurs in it.</p><p>&#x9;We now ask, given a particular equivalence class, how many distinct &#x9;words<br/>can be formed using k elements where k varies from 1 to n.  &#x9;Consider all<br/>non-repeating sequences of n points (there are n! such &#x9;sequences).  Let<br/>S_i be the number of elements in each such sequence &#x9;which must appear<br/>before a sufficient set is encountered.  The F(P) is &#x9;defined as the average,</p><p>&#x9;n!<br/>&#x9;Sigma(S_i) / n!<br/>&#x9;i=1</p><p>&#x9;F(P) may be interpreted as the average number of elements in a non-<br/>repeating sequence of n elements of P(x) required to determine the &#x9;key, x.<br/> Efficiency, E, is defined as F(P)/n and Redundancy, R, as 1 - &#x9;F(P)/n.<br/>Both numbers lie between 0 and 1.</p><p>&#x9;It should be noted that this kind of efficiency and redundancy differs<br/>from the meanings these terms assume in information theory.  The<br/>distinction is important and applies to alphabets in spoken natural<br/>languages as well as to musical scales.  The redundancy of information<br/>theory refers to a redundancy in the message, not in the code.  In our<br/>discussion here, that property of the code which determines whether<br/>efficient messages _can_ be constructed (if such are desired) is<br/>considered.  This property is inherent in the code itself, and does &#x9;not<br/>apply to the message.</p><p>Rothenberg outlines six scenarios...</p><p>&#x9;  Scale type  Stability    Efficiency<br/>&#x9;(a)  proper       high         high<br/>&#x9;(b)  proper       high         low<br/>&#x9;(c)  proper       low          high<br/>&#x9;(d)  proper       low          low<br/>&#x9;(e)  improper     ----         high<br/>&#x9;(f)  improper     ----         low</p><p>And discusses them...</p><p>&#x9;Notice that in Figure 1, all scales in 12tET with which we are most<br/>familiar (the major, minor, and Chinese pentatonic) conform to &#x9;situation<br/>(a).  In fact, the major scale (of which the &quot;natural&quot; minor &#x9;is a mode) is<br/>far higher in both stability and efficiency than any &#x9;other 7-tone scale.<br/>Next among 7-tone scales is the &quot;melodic&quot; minor &#x9;(2,2,2,2,1,2,1).  The<br/>Chinese pentatonic stands out among scales of 5 &#x9;and 6 tones.</p><p>&#x9;However, situation (b) applies to many scales with which we are &#x9;familiar,<br/>such as the &quot;whole-tone&quot; and &quot;12-tone&quot; scales.  Note that &#x9;while these are<br/>strictly proper scales, from the hearing of a &#x9;sufficient set (any element)<br/>alone, it is not possible to code the &#x9;elements of P into scale degrees.<br/>That is, although PxP is coded by &#x9;the proper mapping, there is no way to<br/>index elements of P except by &#x9;arbitrary choice.  __Thus, since in these<br/>cases intervals are coded &#x9;but tones are not, composition with these scales<br/>must involve &#x9;relations which make use of motivic similarities rather than<br/>relations &#x9;between scale degrees.__  Hence the tone row basis of 12-tone<br/>music &#x9;(which is essentially motivic in concept) is not surprising.  An<br/>examination of&#x9;Debussy&apos;s whole-tone piano prelude &quot;Violes&quot; show &#x9;similar<br/>motivic&#x9;dependency.</p><p>&#x9;Now consider improper scales.  PxP is not coded except by the &#x9;employment<br/>of proper subsets or a fixed tonic.  __Hence information is &#x9;primarily<br/>communicated by the scale degrees.__  Thus it is important &#x9;that P be coded<br/>as quickly as possible, which is indicated by a high &#x9;redundancy (low<br/>efficiency) as in case (f).  It would be expected that &#x9;scales<br/>characterized by case (e) would be extremely difficult to use, &#x9;except when<br/>the tonic is fixed by a drone or similar device and, in &#x9;fact, we have not<br/>discovered such scales in any musical culture &#x9;examined thus far.  In<br/>general, the use of motivic sequences on &#x9;different scale degrees of<br/>improper scales would not be expected &#x9;(except within proper subsets of<br/>such scales), and this is strongly &#x9;supported by examination of Indian and<br/>other music using improper &#x9;scales.</p><p>&#x9;We would also expect that proper scales characterized by low stability<br/>would tend to be used as improper scales, so that case (c) would &#x9;resemble<br/>case (e), and (d) resemble (f), and similar remarks apply.</p><p>Makes cross-cultural observations...</p><p>&#x9;In Java there exist two scale systems, &quot;Slendro&quot; and &quot;Pelog&quot;, each<br/>containing a variety of scales.  It has been observed that all scales &#x9;in<br/>the &quot;Slendro&quot; class are strictly proper and that all in the &quot;Pelog&quot; &#x9;class<br/>are improper.  In a study conducted with the assistance of Mr. &#x9;Surya Brata<br/>of the Ministry of Education and Culture, Jakarta, the &#x9;uses of these scale<br/>systems were observed to be in accord with the &#x9;predictions of this model.</p><p>References to the Javanese study...</p><p>&#x9;Kunst, J.
