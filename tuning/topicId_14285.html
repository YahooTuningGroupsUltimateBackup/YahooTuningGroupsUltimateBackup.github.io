To me, each and every tuning has it&apos;s own<br/>internal logic and shape...how one uses them is the primary issue. Words<br/>like strange and weird only have a context in relation to the person<br/>using them...very little seems strange to me at this stage of my<br/>life...maybe politics...Hstick</p></div>
