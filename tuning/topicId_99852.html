(Is it the same thing?)</p><p>The regular temperament or regular mapping paradigm, in its simplest<br/>form, is what you&apos;re doing when you look at 12-equal and you say that<br/>7 steps is a mistuned 3/2, and that 4 steps is a mistuned 5/4. In this<br/>case, what you&apos;re actually doing is coming up with a schema relating<br/>the equal temperament to a mistuned form of JI. The general way to go<br/>about doing this is to first &quot;map&quot; the primes (like 2/1, 3/1, 5/1,<br/>etc) and then work out how &quot;composite&quot; intervals (like 5/4) would be<br/>mapped by combining the mapped primes.</p><p>&gt; 3) What exactly is harmonic entropy, and is this what is meant by &quot;HE&quot;?</p><p>HE is Harmonic Entropy, yes. HE is a preliminary attempt to merge<br/>music theory and information theory together; it&apos;s a model of<br/>consonance proposed by Paul Erlich that attempts to measure how<br/>confused your brain is when it hears an interval. When you hear<br/>50001/40000, for example, it&apos;s probably going to get sucked into the<br/>perception of 5/4. But when you hear 11/9, on the other hand, there<br/>are going to be a lot of intervals competing for the &quot;perception&quot; of<br/>that interval. The postulate here is that more confusion = more<br/>dissonance.</p><p>The current hot topic in music theory around here is to what extent<br/>learning can affect the accuracy of this model.</p><p>&gt; 4) A while back on the xenwiki, I found a somewhat helpful description of what a comma pump does, but could someone please give me a few well-commented examples?</p><p>Meantone is the temperament eliminating 81/80. This means that it<br/>equates 81/64 and 5/4, 32/27 and 6/5, and 9/8 and 10/9. It also means,<br/>by definition, that it equates 81/80 and 1/1. Comma pumps work off of<br/>this principle. A comma pump is a chord progression that, if you were<br/>to tune it in JI with the most consonant root movements possible at<br/>every turn, wouldn&apos;t actually end you back where you started, but<br/>rather some comma up. For example -</p><p>A good example in meantone would be Cmaj - Am - Dm - Gmaj - Cmaj. If<br/>you were to do this in JI, you&apos;d go down 6/5, up 4/3, up 4/3, and down<br/>3/2. If you multiply that all out, that means that the net effect of<br/>that chord progression would be to move you down by 81/80 in JI.<br/>However, in meantone, you end up back where you started, because 81/80<br/>is tempered to be equal to 1/1.</p><p>The main point is that this if you tried to actually tune this in<br/>5-limit JI, you&apos;d end up some 73 octaves below where you started by<br/>the end of the song.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AapxXRlsdwA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AapxXRlsdwA</a></p><p>Or you&apos;d have to move by Pythagorean intervals or have comma shifts in<br/>the middle of the chord progression, which is fine, but you&apos;d probably<br/>like it better if you just meantone-tempered the whole thing.</p><p>Lastly, comma pumps may be a huge part of how tonality works - they<br/>enable you to leave the tonic along direction x, and then come back to<br/>it from direction y. Here&apos;s a porcupine comma pump (excuse my<br/>butchering of the explanation of this on camera, it was like 6 AM :))</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfnyr1MhXE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfnyr1MhXE</a></p><p>Some other attempts to work the porcupine comma pump into tonal<br/>harmony can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic</a></p><p>&gt; 5) I think I have a rough idea, maybe, how the ratios for intervals can be used to build consonant chords; however, I&apos;ve gotten the impression the harmonic series can also be used in a similar way. Is this actually the case, and if so, what&apos;s the procedure?</p><p>What do you mean by this? What is the difference between a ratio from<br/>the harmonic series and one that&apos;s not from the harmonic series?</p><p>&gt; 6) What does &quot;omnitetrachordal&quot; mean?</p><p>An omnitetrachordal scale is one that displays sub-periodicity around<br/>the 4/3; e.g. for any pattern of steps inside of some 4/3 in the<br/>scale, that pattern is replicated in another 4/3-chunk going either up<br/>or down from it. There are a few additional restrictions on various<br/>strong and weak versions of this depending on who you talk to, but<br/>that&apos;s the basic gist of it.</p><p>&gt; 7) &apos;13-EDO as a Father temperament or 11-EDO as a Hanson temperament ... / Hell, for all my blathering about 13-EDO really being &quot;Uncle&quot;, I tend to treat it as &quot;A-Team&quot;, the 2.9.21 subgroup that I guess I discovered&apos; -- can anyone explain what any of that means? (I don&apos;t mean that to mock or anything; I really want to understand.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8) &quot;If I&apos;m not going to use 12-TET, what can I use instead and how can I make it sound good?&quot; (Thanks for putting it in a nutshell, Igs.) ;-)</p><p>It depends on your personality. Some people here really like moving<br/>more and more towards the higher-accuracy, JI/microtemperament<br/>direction (Carl, Gene), others like moving more and more towards the<br/>direction of having more interesting puns and comma pumps (Petr), and<br/>others like exploring high-error temperaments to see how they shake up<br/>the limits of your perception (Igs), and others like me are still<br/>finding their voice and trying to explore as much as possible. There<br/>really is no &quot;magic bullet.&quot; If you prefer a gradual evolution of your<br/>paradigm, you might like to start with 19-equal first, since it also<br/>supports meantone but offers additional possibilities as well. If you<br/>want to shock your nervous system into something new, you might find<br/>that you vibe really well with 15-equal or 16-equal. If what you want<br/>is to explore higher-limit harmony, 22-equal might be the tuning for<br/>you. If you want a combination of higher-limit harmonies as well as<br/>higher accuracy, and don&apos;t mind having more notes, 31-equal, 41-equal,<br/>46-equal might be the tuning for you. If you have no practical<br/>limitations at all and don&apos;t care how many notes you want to use, but<br/>you just want a tuning that&apos;s easy to &quot;think in,&quot; you just can&apos;t beat<br/>72-equal, period.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>domeofatonement &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2011 9:24:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; 5) I think I have a rough idea, maybe, how the ratios for intervals can be used to build consonant chords; however, I&apos;ve gotten the impression the harmonic series can also be used in a similar way. Is this actually the case, and if so, what&apos;s the procedure?</p><p>Mike didn&apos;t quite answer this one, so I&apos;ll try to shed some light.</p><p>There isn&apos;t any single procedure for finding consonant JI chords, because whether or not a chord is consonant depends on multiple factors.  These factors include, but are not limited to: &quot;height&quot; in the harmonic series, prime/odd limit, difference tones, sum tones (for distorted chords), roughness, and sympathetic vibrations.  Not to mention that social conditioning can determine a lot of what you hear as either  sounding good or bad.</p><p>-Ryan</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2011 9:36:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Also, if you&apos;re looking for JI consonances, you might check this out on Wikipedia:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality_diamond">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality_diamond</a></p><p>&quot;The tonality diamond is often regarded as comprising the set of consonances &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance</a>&gt; of the n-limit. &quot;</p><p>&quot;[Harry] Partch arranged the elements of the tonality diamond in the shape of a rhombus &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombus">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombus</a>&gt;, and subdivided into (n+1)^2 /4 smaller rhombuses. Along the upper left side of the rhombus are placed the odd numbers from 1 to n, each reduced to the octave (divided by the minimum power of 2 such that 1 \le r &lt; 2). These intervals are then arranged in ascending order. Along the lower left side are placed the corresponding reciprocals, 1 to 1/n, also reduced to the octave (here, /multiplied/ by the minimum power of 2 such that 1 \le r &lt; 2). These are placed in descending order. At all other locations are placed the product of the diagonally upper- and lower-left intervals, reduced to the octave. This gives all the elements of the tonality diamond, with some repetition. Diagonals sloping in one direction form Otonalities &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otonality_and_Utonality">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otonality_and_Utonality</a>&gt; and the diagonals in the other direction form Utonalities.

(Is it the same<br/>&gt; thing?)</p><p>The Regular Mapping Paradigm is a web page here:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/paradigm.html">http://x31eq.com/paradigm.html</a></p><p>I chose &quot;mapping&quot; over &quot;temperament&quot; because there are<br/>cases where the mapping is relevant even if you aren&apos;t<br/>using a regular temperament.  You can use just intonation<br/>in a regular-mapping way if you think of complex ratios as<br/>standing in for simpler ratios.  Erv Wilson&apos;s &quot;Scales of Mt<br/>Meru&quot; are rational constructions that can be tied to regular<br/>mappings.  Circular temperaments can be thought of as<br/>detunings of equal temperaments, and may be inspired by<br/>higher rank mappings.</p><p>Most importantly, a scheme for adaptive temperament can be<br/>specified in the light of the relevant mappings.  This is a<br/>model for how a flexible pitch performance will work.  You<br/>can think of a score as a set of pitch relationships that<br/>the performers try to preserve (according to taste) and<br/>melodic constraints that arise out of those harmonic<br/>relationships.  The mapping makes all this explicit.<br/>Conventional staff notation encodes the meantone mapping,<br/>and is sometimes taken to describe the mapping for<br/>12-equal.</p><p>If the regular mapping paradigm is really a paradigm, it<br/>should be possible to specify all musical pitch in terms of<br/>it.  Because the ideal intervals can be whatever you like,<br/>it defaults to a &quot;fuzzy pitch paradigm&quot; where each pitch is<br/>specified with an allowable range of error around its ideal<br/>tuning and the mapping disappears behind the sofa.  This<br/>paradigm is more expressive than the conventional approach,<br/>where a fixed scale is specified (usually in terms of cents<br/>or ratios) and it&apos;s assumed that the music was written in<br/>that scale and the performers should be following that scale<br/>with no guide as to how far they can deviate from it.  The<br/>mappings come in because sometimes you describe the scales<br/>with a simpler framework than the ideal intervals you think<br/>you&apos;re approximating.</p><p>Depending on the definition, a regular temperament is<br/>either a fixed tuning with a mapping from just intonation,<br/>or a set of tunings with a few free parameters.  As many<br/>observed tunings aren&apos;t regular, a regular temperament<br/>paradigm can&apos;t have universal application -- unless you<br/>expand the concept of &quot;temperament&quot; to a point where it<br/>becomes meaningless.</p><p>Regular mappings are more general because the resulting<br/>tuning doesn&apos;t have to be regular.  But, still, the regular<br/>mapping paradigm is most useful when the tuning is close to<br/>regular and the ideal tuning follows some meaningful<br/>framework (usually small-integer ratios).  Where regular<br/>mappings aren&apos;t useful I don&apos;t know of any alternative<br/>paradigm that does better.</p><p>&gt; 5) I think I have a rough idea, maybe, how the ratios for<br/>&gt; intervals can be used to build consonant chords; however,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve gotten the impression the harmonic series can also<br/>&gt; be used in a similar way. Is this actually the case, and<br/>&gt; if so, what&apos;s the procedure?</p><p>You take frequency ratios relative to the root and multiply<br/>through by the lowest common denominator. So, a 5-limit<br/>major triad has intervals</p><p>5:4 6:5</p><p>The relative to the root, the chord becomes</p><p>1/1:1/1*5/4:1/1*5/4*6/5</p><p>or</p><p>1/1:5/4:3/2</p><p>The lowest common denominator is 4, and multiplying through<br/>by that gives</p><p>4:5:6</p><p>A minor triad has the same intervals in a different order:</p><p>6:5 5:4</p><p>That works out as</p><p>1/1:6/5:3/2</p><p>The lowest common denominator is 10, giving a harmonic<br/>series fragment of</p><p>10:12:15</p><p>For more complex harmonies, a lot of us find that following<br/>the harmonic series is a better way of predicting<br/>consonance than looking at the simplicity of the<br/>constituent intervals in a chord.</p><p>&gt; 6) What does &quot;omnitetrachordal&quot; mean?</p><p>It means a scale contains the same pattern of intervals,<br/>covering a fourth, repeated twice in the scale.  C major is<br/>an example: C-D-E-F is &quot;tone tone semitone&quot; and so is<br/>G-A-B-C.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
