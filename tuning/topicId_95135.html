However this is true determination!  What an excellent route you devised.</p><p>I use a fender mustang with a roland gr20 which is a bit similar. I think, judging from what Igs has said, the biggest difference is in the tuning of the open strings. Compared to a real 17edo guitar Igs found my open string tuning &ldquo;compressed&ldquo;.</p><p>Chris<br/>*</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Herman Miller &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@IO.COM">hmiller@IO.COM</a>&gt;<br/>Sender: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Mon, 20 Dec 2010 22:34:01<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Reply-To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [tuning] Experiment with 15-ET guitar</p><p>I&apos;ve added a new example to my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/">sites.google.com/site/teamouse/</a> page.</p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/15guitartest.mp3">http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/15guitartest.mp3</a></p><p>It&apos;s very crude, since I don&apos;t even know how to play a 12-ET guitar, but<br/>I managed to find a few chords on the 15-ET guitar, and it definitely<br/>has potential.</p><p>Actually, this isn&apos;t a real 15-ET guitar at all, but the Acoustic Guitar<br/>from Garritan Jazz &amp; Big Band tuned in TOP 15-ET, controlled by the Rock<br/>Band 3 MadCatz Fender Mustang guitar controller.

The stretched 5th, IMVHO, still is close enough to sound decent, the<br/>major and minor thirds are as good or better than 12TET, and there&apos;s a strong<br/>5/3 sixth and 7/4 augmented sixth in there.</p><p>   The guitar example on</p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/15guitartest.mp3">http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/15guitartest.mp3</a><br/>   ...sounds simple but strong to me and, yes, consonant enough to fool<br/>non-microtonalists into calling in musical.<br/>  On the flip side...to my ears the &quot;good&quot; chord selection here, by and large,<br/>simply sounds like 12TET-style chords.  Then again, I&apos;ve found, the most<br/>consonant scales tend to have at least 65-70% of their so-called good chords in<br/>common (either in actually notes or general mood IE via inversions) with 12TET<br/>chords.  History repeats itself...despite our hate for it&apos;s &quot;imperfection&quot;...it<br/>becomes obvious why so many leading tunings have so much in common,<br/>emotion-wise, with 12TET and the whole concept of diatonic feel.</p></div>
