Size of the denominator,<br/>arithmetic mean of numerator and denominator, and geometric mean of n and d<br/>were three of the most popular, the last being my favorite (see TD 1216.4).<br/> Largely dismissed were metrics based on prime factorization.</p><p>Aside from this, two useful concepts discussed and named (thanks to Dave<br/>Keenan):</p><p>1. TOLERANCE- Irrational intervals, like those found in ETs, can be<br/>consonant when they are close in size to rational intervals.  A definition<br/>of consonance based on properties of rational numbers (as above) can be<br/>adapted to explain this by including a TOLERANCE funtion.  Everybody&apos;s<br/>favorite is Paul Erlich&apos;s Harmonic Entropy, which, along the way, explains<br/>one of the reasons why small-numbered ratios are consonant in the first place.</p><p>2. SPAN- When intervals are very small, they can be highly dissonant<br/>although they may be represented by small-numbered ratios.  When intervals<br/>are very large, they may have very low dissonance _and_ consonance.  For<br/>example, one can play almost any notes together 6 octaves apart on a piano<br/>and they won&apos;t sound particularly consonant, but they won&apos;t clash either.<br/>This runs contrary to the idea that consonance and dissonance represent<br/>opposite ends of the same spectrum.  No rigorous adjustment for SPAN was<br/>worked out, although normalizing all intervals to the octave between 8/7<br/>and 16/7 is one expedient workaround.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=4438 href="#4438">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

To my mind,<br/>no one had a counterargument of substance. We were left in a position where<br/>several different complexity measures (n, d, n+d, n*d) made sense for<br/>numbers up to about 13, beyond which tolerance effects became more<br/>important, and techniques like harmonic entropy look necessary.</p><p>How did you derive your algorithm? It looks like you used 12-tone equal<br/>temperament in some way. What does your algorithm give for ratios without<br/>powers of two in the denominator? For really complex ratios? Do the borders<br/>ever overlap? Any harmonic entropy calculation will come up with the most<br/>likely ratio for any cents interval, which would automatically define<br/>non-overlapping borders for a set of simple ratios (more complex ones would<br/>never be recognized as such).</p></div>
