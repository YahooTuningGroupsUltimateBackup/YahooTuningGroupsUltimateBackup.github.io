(PNM Article)</p><p>I understand the mailgroup dynamic, and am aware that among the residents there will be some who have /views/ and others who like a good honest debate. From my own point of view as a theorist/composer, all I&apos;ll say is that, whether or no the scale in question is constructed from JI components (aka ratios) or whether it is formed from an ET or cyclic set of pitches shouldn&apos;t really be of concern. What should be of concern is trying to get others to see that there is beautiful music beyond 12TET.</p><p>Generalised diatonics are just one of my concerns. Please read the article (which for copyright reasons I can&apos;t reproduce here or on a website), and you will see that I also discuss ratios in relation to generalised diatonics, and makes some interesting discoveries.</p><p>I studied acoustics at university. The harmonic series is a phenomenon of certain physical systems, and there is a whole branch of mathematics for it. But, there is also an inharmonic world out there, just as valid. Not everything that is good is only formed from the relationships between integers.</p><p>On the front of notation, do people have an opinion about Equiton????</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=33123 href="#33123">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/24/2002 5:57:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:E16TfMl-0007Mb-00@smtp.argonet.co.uk">E16TfMl-0007Mb-00@smtp.argonet.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>Mark Gould wrote:</p><p>&gt; Generalised diatonics are just one of my concerns.

When I mentioned this<br/>before, I got summaries of Balzano and Zweifel&apos;s ideas, and they didn&apos;t<br/>sound that interesting.  How closely do you follow them, or what am I<br/>missing?</p><p>&gt; I studied acoustics at university. The harmonic series is a phenomenon<br/>&gt; of certain physical systems, and there is a whole branch of mathematics<br/>&gt; for it.

If you check<br/>the code at &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/temper.html">http://x31eq.com/temper.html</a>&gt; you will see some<br/>inharmonic examples.  I don&apos;t know what it would mean to you at this<br/>stage.</p><p>So for me, at least, it isn&apos;t the harmonic series that&apos;s the issue but<br/>consonance.  In practice, that&apos;s only a trivial difference between me an<br/>certain other members of the list who only consider the harmonic series.<br/>But as the Balzano/Zweifel ideas were explained to me, they seem to be<br/>completely unrelated.  Where do you fit in to all this?</p><p>These lists don&apos;t have a constitution, and you&apos;ve chosen to make your<br/>entrance here which is fine.  But the way this thread&apos;s going, it would be<br/>better on tuning-math.</p><p>&gt; On the front of notation, do people have an opinion about Equiton????</p><p>What&apos;s Equiton????????????</p><p>Incidentally, contrary to what the subject line suggests there are quite a<br/>few musical examples by members of these lists online.

In the near future, this forum (or some decedent<br/>of it) will be the standard peer-review acid test for theoretical<br/>work in musical tuning.

I would think you should certainly be entitled<br/>to do so, whatever copyright restrictions may apply to your actual<br/>text.</p><p>&gt; I studied acoustics at university. The harmonic series is a<br/>&gt;phenomenon of certain physical systems, and there is a whole branch<br/>&gt;of mathematics for it. But, there is also an inharmonic world out<br/>&gt;there, just as valid. Not everything that is good is only formed<br/>&gt;from the relationships between integers.</p><p>This is very true. I especially like to point out cases where various<br/>tempered systems might be seen as aesthetically preferable to JI. But<br/>there are several unavoidable psychoacoustical phenomena that have a<br/>huge impact on the _sensual_ qualities of musical sounds. Please bear<br/>with me while I touch on just one of these.</p><p>When we hear a spectrum that approximates a harmonic series, we hear<br/>a single pitch, the fundamental, even if the spectral component<br/>corresponding to that fundamental is physically absent. If the<br/>components of the spectrum are far from a harmonic series, we have no<br/>such sense of a single pitch -- the sensation falls apart into two or<br/>more different, less clearly grasped pitches. (See, for example,<br/>Pierce&apos;s _Science of Musical Sound_ or Terhardt&apos;s web pages).</p><p>Now certain chords will, when all the spectral components are taken<br/>together, approximate a harmonic series. These chords have a very<br/>clear _root_, corresponding to the fundamental of that harmonic<br/>series (see Parncutt&apos;s _Harmony: A Psychoacoustical Approach_). Other<br/>chords will have spectra which fail mimic, even in part, a clear<br/>harmonic series, and thus fail to evoke any sense of _coherence_<br/>whatsoever. A composer who write music for multiple voices, either<br/>consciously or unconsciously, must be aware of the play of coherence<br/>and incoherence that his or her chords produce, or else he or she<br/>will fail to be able to exercise artistic control over his or her<br/>creation.</p><p>That&apos;s just one point, and I&apos;m sure Bob Wendell and others would love<br/>to expand on it. Although this point of view agrees with a lifetime<br/>of music listening, performing, and experimenting, I am very open to<br/>other viewpoints and the constructs/music that result from them. I<br/>hope you will share!</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=33152 href="#33152">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2002 2:23:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mark,</p><p>I just noticed your subject line and wonder what you are implying by<br/>it.</p><p>A great many of us (myself included) are engaged at least part-time<br/>in creating microtonal music.
