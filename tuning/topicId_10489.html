First up was a<br/>piano and cello duet by Doug Boyce and David Langella, two Ph.D. candidates<br/>at Penn. Nattily attired in matching Dockers and loafers, they offered four<br/>movements of free-improv squeaky-squawky and clangy-bangy full of sul ponte<br/>bowing and fingers-on-strings piano drumming.<br/>       On to better and more soulful things. David renders his Just<br/>Intonation<br/>guitar synthesizer music using a conventionally fretted 12-ET solidbody<br/>electric but using only the MIDI pickup output. His synth modules then<br/>respond in a chosen JI scale. &apos;Temple&apos; uses a 19-limit scale that I believe<br/>was first used by Wendy Carlos; 1/1, 17/16, 9/8, 19/16, 5/4, 21/16, 11/8,<br/>3/2, 13/8, 27/16, 7/4,15/8. This scale offers (to me) a particularly vivid<br/>mix of consonance and dissonance, a mix that Beardsley used subtly in this<br/>very slowly unfolding (hour-plus) exploration.<br/>       Digital delays were relied upon heavily here, repeating high limit<br/>arpeggios<br/>against tonic drones then layering in cross motives for textural effect.<br/>Occasionally, high pealing tones of simpler consonance seemed to signal a<br/>move to different sections of the music and different moods of the scale.<br/>The piece ended with a much more active (for this style) melodic<br/>improvisation.<br/>       I don&apos;t know Beardsley&apos;s influences in this field but I heard much<br/>more of  Indian music than Klaus Schulze, more of LaMonte Young than Star&apos;s<br/>End. Overall, it was a thoroughly involving and convincing performance.<br/>       Missed the final musician Aharon Varady, a sound collagist.</p><p>                             Reporting from Philly,  Bob Lodge</p></div>
