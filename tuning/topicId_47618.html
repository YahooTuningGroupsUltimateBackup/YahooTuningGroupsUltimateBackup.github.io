The sharps are as logical as can be and have been used my many,<br/>many composers.

This is shown by years of usage.  There<br/>have been occasions, such as when wanting to emphasize a particular interval,<br/>or in a transposition, where a larger number was used, and it is immensely<br/>more difficult to negotiate.  The quartertones are now as reliable as the 12<br/>tones once were.  Hence, a violinist only needs to roll a finger to find a<br/>microtone with less than a 49 cents difference.</p><p>Gene, negative numbers are used in front of the numbers when they are<br/>subtracted.  Positive numbers are also used.  It might be suggested that they are not<br/>necessary since without the plus sign should indicate that it is a positive<br/>number.  But in reading music, the lack of a sign makes the mind wander/wonder<br/>which slows down the process.  I even suggest a -1 and a +1 although some make<br/>think this useless.  It is not.  Keep in mind (pardon the pun) that the<br/>bassoon is tuned completely in the mind, and every distinction needs be notated for<br/>the mind.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=47643 href="#47643">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/5/2003 1:34:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Why bizarre?
