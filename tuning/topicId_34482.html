We only started talking again in early 2000.</p><p>I actually had to talk to Fred Freeburg, my old bass player, for a couple<br/>hours the other night, to try to remember even all the guitars I built.<br/>Anyone who would listen to me, I&apos;d buy them a guitar and refret it in 19 for<br/>them.  I think I still missed a few.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>&quot;The Trance Who Played 323&quot;</p><p>I remember when Ken first tried playing my 323 fretboard.  He was having a<br/>little trouble with it, and sort of gestured at me, what do I do.  I said<br/>&quot;It&apos;s kind of like 94, only ... (I held my hands up measuring about a foot,<br/>and jerked the distance to maybe 14 inches)&quot; and within about 15 seconds, he<br/>was soloing in sixteenth notes and such.</p><p>Thing is, at that point, I&apos;d been playing the 323 a lot and sequencing a lot<br/>in it, it was a current project so my sensitivity to it was very high.  Put<br/>it this way.  The main fifth in 323 sounds just.  323 is 17 times 19.  So<br/>you go a step or two in either direction you hit the 17 or 19 fifth which<br/>you could definitely hear with the guitar timbre.  The note in between is<br/>very close to 12.  So you have:</p><p>&quot;17&quot;, near just, near 12, &quot;19&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s a pretty recognizable arrangement.  On a side note, this is how I was<br/>able to distinguish a lot of higher temperaments, each having a unique<br/>bouquet of useable fifths, so they sort of adopt little personality traits<br/>of the proximities of each fifth.  Anyway, I had learned over the week or so<br/>to sense the different colorations.  If anything each note is 4 cents apart<br/>or so.</p><p>I was actually moved to see different colors when a note was off, honestly.<br/>I suppose I could have tested that.  Anyway, after a few seconds of<br/>remembering the feel of 94, Ken took off and didn&apos;t come back for awhile.<br/>Every note was right on the 229+94 scale, as he was able to visualize the<br/>nested scale in the fretboard markings.</p><p>Ken&apos;s and Fred&apos;s free time were eventually destroyed by the same biological<br/>virus, I think they called it &quot;wife and two kids&quot;.</p><p>Actually it was Ken and his daughter who were supposed to be two of the<br/>people playing the Mostly Electric String Quartet No. 1 who CANCELLED A WEEK<br/>BEFORE THE SHOW... Leaving me spinning and exasperated which is what<br/>motivated me to record the entire thing on my computer, play solo along with<br/>my computer, and burn some CDs the night before the concert.</p><p>The joke had been &quot;Ken has procrastinated working with me for so long that<br/>he&apos;s produced a 12 year old daughter who plays violin.&quot;  The &quot;Mostly&quot; slow<br/>violin lines were tailored to her performance speed and volume capabilities<br/>which I obtained by a rare phone interview in which I recorded her playing<br/>and analyzed it later.  It&apos;s something she could have handled.  He said she<br/>didn&apos;t have enough time and HE wasn&apos;t comfortable with it even though she<br/>was.</p><p>The putz.  Besides family, don&apos;t trust your friends.  They&apos;re the first to<br/>burn ya.</p><p>This time (No. 2, premiering 5/25/02)  I&apos;m playing it safe.  Me and a laptop<br/>and an open invite for people to work with me in the future...</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>&quot;But how?&quot;</p><p>In 1994, I wrote a program to retune midi files by splitting overlapping<br/>voices in a midi track to avoid confusion and then calculating the<br/>appropriate pitch bend for the note in the temperament I was working in.</p><p>My focus was eventually combinations of different fifths and major thirds.<br/>After simply plugging in temperament data in the program every time I wanted<br/>to run it, I found there are a few DOZEN midi controllers (14, 15, 46, etc)<br/>that aren&apos;t in general use.  So I used different combinations of those for<br/>temperament, 100s digit of temperament, plus or minus syntonic commas and<br/>pyuthagorean</p><p>I&apos;m working on a book called &quot;The Thresh Hold of Perception&quot;, which is going<br/>to include a chronicling of my little journey of self-torture, hundreds of<br/>hours spent pouring my entire brain into temperaments and finding as many<br/>differences and similarities as I could.  Also are my experiences with<br/>volume and time tests and such.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>&quot;You heard WHAT?&quot;</p><p>A few things I figured out was the ability to tell a temperament apart from<br/>any other one depends on how big it is and how long you listen to it.  One<br/>sort of postulate I had was, if you listen to something in one temperament<br/>and then listen to the same thing in a temperament four times as dense, it<br/>will take you about four listens to readjust.  So to evolve the sensitivity,<br/>I found it easiest to always progress by doing slightly less than doubling.</p><p>In other words, to get from 118 to 559, instead of retuning 5 times and<br/>forcing the progress, it&apos;s a lot easier on the brain to play 118, play 205<br/>twice, play 323 twice, maybe play 441 twice, then 559 twice.  Sort of the<br/>difference between parachuting out of a crashing plane, and actually having<br/>a soft landing.</p><p>One thing I&apos;d like to explain though as it&apos;s one of the most incredible<br/>things I list.  Just to show it&apos;s possible... I had some randomly generated<br/>many-voice chords which I was retuning to high temperaments.  Ken was<br/>working the knobs. I needed someone to test me on this one.  I wanted to<br/>make sure I wasn&apos;t tricking myself.  But after AN HOUR of listening to the<br/>same segment back and forth in 1171 and 1342, I swore I could tell the<br/>difference.  And a dozen or so tests confirmed it.</p><p>But it&apos;s elastic.  I haven&apos;t heard over 100 in quite awhile.  It would take<br/>a little time to build back up an overall sensitivity.</p><p>Umm... And Angie just this minute scored us Who tickets for August.  Talk<br/>about hearing sensitivity?  Umm think I should get some really good earplugs<br/>:X</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>&quot;But what have you RECORDED?&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve been perfectionist style fussing over production specs and only tonight<br/>I&apos;m sitting down with the compromise that knowing things are never going to<br/>be perfect, I have to burn some CDs.</p><p>A lot of non-music-theory people who heard my guitar quartet thing in 32<br/>equal, said it didn&apos;t sound out of tune at all.  I&apos;ve done so much cross<br/>referencing with two-digit temperaments, plus I have to say my fretboard<br/>markings are really the key to it all.  Very easy to find your way around<br/>and learn quickly.  One guy at the Microthon was taking a picture of my 32<br/>fretboard, and I said hey you want one of my holding it, and he was like &quot;no<br/>that&apos;s ok.&quot;</p><p>What&apos;s actually done?  Well not a lot.  Some muddy multimicrotonal 4-track<br/>stuff.  Quite honestly, I&apos;ve had some major mental problems in my life and<br/>besides never being able to really start writing AT ALL until I was 22, it<br/>wasn&apos;t until the concert in November 2000 where I&apos;d ever been able to use my<br/>real name, say that I did something, present it to people as my own, etc.</p><p>I think a lot of my current intensity is gotten from having pulled the<br/>slingshot back further and further for a decade and a half.  I&apos;m so wound up<br/>from not having really done anything that by the time I get around to doing<br/>anything, I won&apos;t rest until it&apos;s gone through the whole filter of all I<br/>want to do, pitch time volume and structure wise.</p><p>Sad that it&apos;s taken this long, I know, I apologize for depriving anyone, but<br/>the good news is, the dam has started to break and I have a lot of equally<br/>entertaining stuff ready to go.</p><p>I should have a few CD titles available by the time of the Roulette show in<br/>May.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>&gt; I think he deserves a special commendation, particularly, for his use<br/>&gt; of 0-EDO and 1-EDO...<br/>&gt;</p><p>Philosophically I thought you might like the &quot;infinity&quot;-ET as well as I&apos;ve<br/>found occasionally looking to that idea reinforces the ET continuum.</p><p>Really, past a few thousand, I found quite a few temperaments with good<br/>calcultor qualities.  I&apos;m not sure I even remember some.  &quot;Halloween 69&quot; is<br/>hard to forget.  Actually since then I&apos;ve gained a very good friend who was<br/>born on that day!</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>&quot;The Talking Octave - in 1-ET.&quot;</p><p>I never transcribed, I could probably rewrite from scratch, I think I should<br/>- This was something I thought of when off in some of my first microtonal<br/>thoughts, listening to cassettes.</p><p>I had recently listened to King Crimson&apos;s &quot;Larks Tongues in Aspic&quot; album, so<br/>the tune &quot;The Talking Drum&quot; was still menacing and repeating through my<br/>brain.  This was about a 140bpm jazz rock improv for guitar and violin, with<br/>the bass clearly volleying back and forth between D and Ab for over seven<br/>minutes.</p><p>The Warner/Electra/Atlantic conglomerate put this somewhat annoying series<br/>of 1/2 second long tones (I think 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz), I think<br/>so you could calibrate an equalizer, a series of short sine-wave tones an<br/>octave apart.  I had the headphones on louder than I thought and being a bit<br/>out of reach of the volume knob, I was a little tangled in the cord and was<br/>trying desperately to rip the headphones off before the 4000 or 8000 Hz<br/>tones punctured my ears.  Made the few seconds seem like a streetfighting<br/>eternity.</p><p>So a little inspired and a little annoyed, I wrote a couple minute long<br/>somewhat communicative poking and peeking of what little could actually be<br/>done with octave-only melodies and harmonies.  I&apos;ll give you a hint, it&apos;s<br/>mostly time and volume based.  Lots of polyrhythms.  You got me humming it<br/>again.  It&apos;s turning into a good night.</p><p>(Boo BEEP.

Thanks for writing.</p><p>Give me a couple weeks or so I&apos;ll have CDs ready.</p><p>&gt; The &quot;Diatonic Aperture&quot; is similar to one of Easley Blackwood&apos;s measures,<br/>&gt; is it &quot;R&quot;?  I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s exactly R, but some ratio of tempered<br/>&gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;</p><p>There was an &quot;r&quot; I&apos;ve heard of that I think was the difference between 12 of<br/>a certain fifth minus an octave.  But yeah, it seems common enough an idea.<br/>Borrowed from camera terminology, I just called it an aperture because it<br/>describes the &quot;opening&quot; of the minor second.</p><p>Ironically enough it was Fred Freeburg&apos;s facetiousness, immediately saying<br/>&quot;well what about shutter speed&quot;, that started my micro-studies of musical<br/>time (absolute note duration, pitch and tempo integration etc).</p><p>&gt; &quot;The ALL Temperament&quot; is usually referred to as &quot;the pitch continuum&quot; or<br/>&gt; simply &quot;the continuum&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah I usually call it some kind of continuum as well.  Gives you a slightly<br/>different mental twitch of perspective if you think of it as an actual<br/>temperament, even when you&apos;re playing or writing.  Sort of goes back to when<br/>I first discovered infinity.  Calling the number line a continuum kind of<br/>deromanticizes the mystery of infinity.</p><p>About calling it a pitch continuum, what do you usually measure pitch in?  I<br/>would think Hertz.  Intervals maybe you measure in cents, but only relative.<br/>There&apos;s no real system of measuring &quot;middle C minus 12 cents&quot; as an absolute<br/>pitch reference.  Or its duration other than seconds.</p><p>The idea was to visualize not so much a geometric pitch but also geometric<br/>duration, in that an octave up doubles the frequency but halves the<br/>duration, while an octave down doubles the duration and halves the<br/>frequency.  And intermittent are geometric intervals which, approaching<br/>infinity made a smooth geometric frequency *and* duration scale:</p><p>1.  arithmetic Time (harmonic inverse time) - the &quot;seconds&quot; continuum<br/>2.  arithmetic Inverse Time (harmonic time) - the &quot;Hertz&quot; continuum<br/>3.  geometric time (also geometric inverse time) - the continuum of equal<br/>temperament.</p><p>...which as I said, I use the flip side, duration, in calculating continuum<br/>type tempo changes and note lengths.  And as I also said, I use the Cesium<br/>tick to anchor and relate both.</p><p>Also the All temperament goes hand in hand with the Null temperament.  Ehh I<br/>forgot to add the defs of the silences, empty (0 Hz) and full (inf Hz)...<br/>It&apos;s all sort of Zen after awhile.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2002 1:43:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; The &quot;Diatonic Aperture&quot; is similar to one of Easley Blackwood&apos;s<br/>measures,<br/>&gt; &gt; is it &quot;R&quot;?
