So it is natural to think<br/>of them as inflections to bend those notes<br/>to make pure harmonic series type ratios.</p><p>However when you get to seven limit ratios<br/>involving products of 2, 3, 5 and 7, then<br/>you get new simple ratios such as 7/6<br/>the septimal or subminor third and<br/>9/7 for the supermajor third<br/>- so that the septimal minor chord is<br/>1/1 7/6 3/2<br/>which is often referred to as a subminor<br/>chord. Like a minor chord but the third<br/>is flatter.</p><p>The corresponding major chord is<br/>1/1 9/7 3/2<br/>which is the supermajor chord.</p><p>Then you can use eleven limit ratios<br/>which give notes mid-way between<br/>the twelve tone notes (approximtely)<br/>such as 11/8, 11/9 etc which can be<br/>called undecimal or neutral intervals.</p><p>Some microtonal composers like working<br/>with numbers even higher up the harmonic<br/>series. The thing there is that<br/>the notes in a harmonic series chord<br/>of many notes, say a ninth or eleventh<br/>or thirteenth, will sound more harmonious<br/>if they are in exact harmonic series ratios<br/>and indeed one can go up to high numbers<br/>there and even say a 29/4 or whatever may<br/>be desired by a composer on occasion.<br/>They may want it to be as exactly a<br/>29/4 as it can be to within the<br/>limits of the performer&apos;s ability.</p><p>If the instrument is rich enough in<br/>partials then a performer who is used<br/>to listening out to such things may be<br/>able to hear many of the higher<br/>partials within the instrument<br/>timbre of a single note, and tune to them directly.<br/>One can certainly do that with<br/>7/4, 11/4 and 13/8, 17/8 too<br/>if the instrument is rich enough<br/>in partials such as a typical<br/>bowed string instrument sound for<br/>instance.</p><p>Or if they are using a keyboard retuned<br/>electronically, then it is no<br/>problem for the note to be pitched<br/>to an exact ratio even for pitches<br/>high up the harmonic series, if they use it<br/>with a synth or soft synth capable<br/>of such fine distinctions (e.g.<br/>with C-Sound).</p><p>So then also that explains the reason<br/>for all those inflections and the<br/>large variety of accidentals in<br/>Sagittal - and the reason they<br/>sometimes need to be notated<br/>precisely rather than as just inflections<br/>of the twelve tone notes with the intonation<br/>up to the performer.</p><p>If one is working with three limit<br/>or five limit harmonies then there<br/>is no need for the more exotic<br/>Sgittal accidentals. Sagittal<br/>also accomodates users who<br/>want less precision like that.</p><p>But they are needed for more ratios<br/>that involve use of higher prime<br/>numbers from 7 upwards, related<br/>to the higher partials in the<br/>harmonic series.</p><p>Just intonation Sagittal is a new notation<br/>and there are many other notations used<br/>by microtonalists.</p><p>72-equal is notated using variou accidental schemes<br/>for instance. Also many of the smaller ets<br/>such as 31 are easy to notate using<br/>half sharps and flats, e.g. for 31-et<br/>C C+ C# Db D- D D+ D# Eb E E+ F- F<br/>..</p><p>Scala has many notations for different equal<br/>temperaments.</p><p>Sagittal has a whole range of systems of<br/>accidentals for various n-ets, and I gather<br/>that the aim is to standardise these notations<br/>so that composers working in different ets<br/>can speak to eash other in a common language,<br/>and to make it easier for composers to find<br/>performers able to perform their works<br/>because the performers too would have<br/>only the one standard noation to learn<br/>for each equal temperament.</p><p>There also with the equal temperaments,<br/>many composers now may compose a piece<br/>entirely within a particular equal temperament.<br/>Particularly guitarists as fretted instruments<br/>are easy to tune to equal temperaments so<br/>you get guitars which are tuned to 19 equal<br/>or 31 equal etc. Also nowadays it is<br/>possible to tune keyboards to equal temperaments<br/>electronically. Occasionally you get purpose<br/>built acoustic keyboard instruments in<br/>various ets such as 31-et or 72-et<br/>or 96-et etc (something that I gather<br/>goes back to the middle ages).</p><p>Obviously a player of such an instrument<br/>will be most interested in a system of<br/>accidentals that matches the equal temperament<br/>that there instrument is tuned to.<br/>Also each n-et has its own &quot;flavour&quot;<br/>on fixed pitched instruments so composers<br/>too can be interested in exploring the<br/>flavour of a particular n-et as a set<br/>of fixed pitches e.g. for guitar<br/>or keyboard, rather than as a notation<br/>system for free form just intonation<br/>with inflections.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to say that one has to always<br/>use these high precisino systems.<br/>If the composer wants the performer to<br/>use inflections according to the taste<br/>of the performer as in Arabic music<br/>then it would indeed be inappropriate<br/>to notate the music using a higher<br/>resolution system as the performer<br/>wouldn&apos;t be expected to follow it<br/>anyway. That could only perhaps be<br/>done after the event as a way of<br/>notating what the performer actually<br/>played - or perhaps as a way to notate the<br/>music for a performer not familiar with<br/>the tradition to see how it might<br/>be performed - somewhat in the way that<br/>one might use a written out figured bass part<br/>in Western early music. With the idea<br/>that this is just one example of many<br/>ways of performing the same piece.</p><p>It is too new yet to see how well this<br/>will succeed, but I hope it does myself<br/>as I can see the many advantages.</p><p>So then for instance if you are using<br/>36-et then you could write a piece<br/>using the Sagittal system of accidentals<br/>for 36-et and anyone who is familiar<br/>with that system would be able to read<br/>your score, and if a performer, play it<br/>without the need to learn a new system.<br/>And a higher resolution system may<br/>well be inappropriate for use in some<br/>contexts such as Arabic music.</p><p>I hope this might help to put<br/>your discussion of notations for<br/>36-et into context and make the<br/>connections with Sagittal notation<br/>and the other microtonal notations<br/>clearer.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
