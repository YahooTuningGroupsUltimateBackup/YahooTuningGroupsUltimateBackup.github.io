The result was that about four hours later a dodecatonic scale with an octave quadrature of 2 was accomplished.</p><p>Again the Progression of Musical Cells detailed in my book showed how to detect the traces of the new semitone factors. This time to get their values required more peculiar reasoning and drawings than mathematics.</p><p>I must say the following: When I announced the success of the preceding research, two fellows of the tuning list, particularly one of them, send me one or two emails containing almost insulting phrases against my person. I suggest to the moderator to investigate this case and take the needed action to control the misbehavior of both members now that I am informing about a new scale that probably will be patented.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>Lima, September 22, 2008</p><p>piagui@...</p></div>
