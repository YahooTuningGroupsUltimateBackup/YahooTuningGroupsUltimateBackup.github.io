I have heard trains play 7/9/11<br/>&gt; too. It seems you would want to have a more dissonant interval to cut through<br/>&gt; the masking of the ambient noise. Here I noticed that they change the siren<br/>&gt; patterns here depending on the time of day!</p><p>I&apos;ll be shalliwagged! Paul Erlich was right about cultural conditioning<br/>toward preferred tunings. We singers have evidently been bombarded with 9/7s<br/>from the damndest places. ;-)</p><p>Jer</p></div>
