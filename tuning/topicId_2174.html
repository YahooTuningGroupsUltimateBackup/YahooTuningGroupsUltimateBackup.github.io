Nursery rhymes as sung by kids have ups and downs but<br/>not necessarily tonal centers, and equal temperament is a fairly<br/>recent intellectual construct.

Then, there&apos;s a book by F. Schuyler Matthews, written in<br/>the 19th century, with notated bird songs of American birds. All those<br/>birds seemed to be singing pretty much in the style of Brahms, or Steven<br/>Foster. Then there is French 20th century composer Olivier Messaien, who<br/>wrote a &apos;Catalogue d&apos;oiseaux&apos; for piano solo, with bird songs of many<br/>European birds -- composers had by then discovered atonal music, and<br/>darned if the birds hadn&apos;t discovered it also!</p><p>It reminds me of the story the ethologists tell -- in the early twentieth<br/>century they would go off to study the behaviour of apes, and find that<br/>they lived in monogamous family groups. Then in the 60&apos;s human societies<br/>experienced a sexual revolution, and amazingly enough, the apes apparently<br/>did too, because all of a sudden they were seeing group sex and open<br/>marriages among the apes!</p><p>&gt; Mother won&apos;t let me keep a bird in the house, so I guess I&apos;ll never really<br/>&gt; be able to perform experiments.</p><p>Obvious solution to this -- field work!</p><p>Judy</p></div>
