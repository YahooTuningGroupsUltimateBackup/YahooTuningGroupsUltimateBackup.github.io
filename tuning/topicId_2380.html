Beyond that, aren&apos;t they like Wilson&apos;s lattices except they only<br/>&gt;have one dimension for each prime instead of each odd? What is it that they<br/>&gt;don&apos;t do for you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Are you referring to Monzo&apos;s lattices? The unfortunate thing about them is<br/>&gt;that they only show pitch as angle in a few select cases; otherwise<br/>&gt;interpreting angles as pitch doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>No I was referring to (what might be?) Monzo&apos;s new type, drawn for him by<br/>David Chalmers. Sorry I didn&apos;t make this clear. Monzo corrected my<br/>oversight in Digest 144. In these, pitch is expressed as radial distance,<br/>not polar angle. See<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/w-jchalm/1999-3-29/oc-red1.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/w-jchalm/1999-3-29/oc-red1.htm</a></p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;That&apos;s a nice visualization of Lumma&apos;s scale. But what is that mysterious<br/>&gt;connection between d# and ab? An approximate 11:8?</p><p>I assume you learned, when you read on, that it was indeed an approximate<br/>11:8. Incidentally the error was 4.5c, not 6.5c as I said in that message.<br/>But that&apos;s still not a good enough approximation for such a complex ratio<br/>(particularly in relation to the accuracy of the other ratios in this<br/>scale). Equal weighting of errors *really* fails for ratios of 11.</p><p>Paul Erlich<br/>&gt; Otherwise, it is quite<br/>&gt;similar in concept to the way I depicted the decatonic scales in my paper<br/>&gt;(pages 30 and 31 -- instead of note names I have 22-tET degrees) in that<br/>&gt;all 7-limit tetrads are shown as tetrahedra.</p><p>Similar in the concept that all 7-limit tetrads are shown as tetrahedra,<br/>yes. But I take this to be a minimum requirement. I thought for a minute<br/>that you were saying there was a decatonic hiding in Lumma&apos;s scale.</p><p>&gt;Since I was most interested in the<br/>&gt;tetrads, I would eliminate the connections that are not parts of tetrads:<br/>...<br/>&gt;or, since I was also interested in chains of fifths, I might go back to<br/>&gt;the arrangement considered in connection with Fokker&apos;s version of this<br/>&gt;scale<br/>&gt;                                   f<br/>&gt;                                  / \<br/>&gt;                                 /   \<br/>&gt;               a---------e---------b---------f#<br/>&gt;              /|\       /|\&grave;.  /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\  ,&apos;/<br/>&gt;             / | \     / | \  db-/---\--ab /<br/>&gt;            /  d#--------a# \ | /     \ | /<br/>&gt;           /,&apos;  \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/  &grave;.\|/       \|/<br/>&gt;          f------\--c--/------g---------d<br/>&gt;                  \ | /<br/>&gt;                   \|/<br/>&gt;                    f#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;so that the chains of fifths are laid out more clearly.<br/>&gt;I might prefer the last one above because chains of fifths are so<br/>&gt;important to harmonic progressions.</p><p>Yes. That&apos;s a very useful view of it, for the reason you gave. But note<br/>that it fails to show the B and Fm triads, since it completely omits two<br/>consonant intervals. These are in fact the only thing that makes Lumma&apos;s<br/>different to Fokker&apos;s. So I would feel obliged to extend this to</p><p>                                   f---------c<br/>                                  / \       /<br/>                                 /   \     /<br/>               a---------e---------b---------f#<br/>              /|\       /|\&grave;.  /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/<br/>             / | \     / | \  db-/---\--ab /<br/>            /  d#--------a# \ | /     \ | /<br/>           /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/  &grave;.\|/       \|/<br/>          f--/---\--c--/------g---------d<br/>            /     \ | /<br/>           /       \|/<br/>          b---------f#</p><p>even though it duplicates more than the minimum number of notes, or at least</p><p>                                   f<br/>                                  / \/<br/>                                 /  /\     /<br/>               a---------e---------b---------f#<br/>              /|\       /|\&grave;.  /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/<br/>             / | \     / | \  db-/---\--ab /<br/>            /  d#--------a# \ | /     \ | /<br/>           /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\ /,&apos;/  &grave;.\|/       \|/<br/>          f--/---\--c--/------g---------d<br/>            /     \/| /<br/>                  /\|/<br/>                    f#</p><p>The best understanding is probably gained by looking at mine and yours<br/>together (yours as extended above?).

I notice that you lined yours up<br/>vertically with mine; very nice. Why do you favour lowercase for these<br/>diagrams?</p><p>At present I&apos;m fooling around with the 6:8:11 (A#:D#:Ab) and its<br/>relationships (in the new temperament that I gave in digest 144), and your<br/>favoured view breaks *them* badly. I didn&apos;t show the two 6:11&apos;s since it is<br/>too hard in ASCII. The other 6:11 is of course D#:Db, but a 1/11:1/8:1/6<br/>chord is just mud. Mind you, 6:8:11 isn&apos;t much better. :-)</p><p>I gave the wrong sign for the error in the 6:11 in my new temperament. The<br/>errors are</p><p> 2:3   4:5   5:6   4:7   5:7   6:7   6:11   8:11<br/>-2.74 -2.74  0    -3.24 -0.5  -0.5   1.47  -1.27 cents</p><p>The absolute value of the errors in 6:11 and 8:11 are in the proportion<br/>log(8) to log(6). I figure this gives them equal beats in the 6:8:11 and<br/>hence minimises the roughness of that chord in this scale. It sounds ok to<br/>me, but it wouldn&apos;t sound much different if they were made equal in cents.<br/>Notice that the improvement in the 11&apos;s is mostly at the expense of the 4:7<br/>which used to be just.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2433 href="#2433">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
