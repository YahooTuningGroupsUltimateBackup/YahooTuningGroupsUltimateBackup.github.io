I was<br/>particularly fascinated with the &quot;mirror&quot; parallel between the<br/>decreasing size of the perfect fifths going toward the later Western<br/>meantone and the INCREASING size of the fifths (and thirds) as we<br/>approach the &quot;theoretical&quot; direction of the &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; tunings, ending<br/>up with 22t-ET, the Paul Erlich favorite...</p><p>My question has to do with the historical relationship of all this.<br/>It&apos;s been a while since I &quot;formally&quot; studied a little Medieval music.<br/>(I did have a graduate course with Gwynn McPeak at the University of<br/>Michigan).</p><p>Do any of these &quot;neo Gothic&quot; tunings actually exist in history, or are<br/>they present-day formulations to hear Medieval music a little<br/>differently??  I guess the 17t-ET existed then...  but the others??</p><p>Is it possible to consider them because it is not entirely known exactly<br/>what was done??  Is it also because the thirds were variable, so it<br/>COULD be possible that larger thirds were used in performance which<br/>would lend themselves to one of the &quot;neo&quot; schemes??</p><p>I need a little bit more historical background.
