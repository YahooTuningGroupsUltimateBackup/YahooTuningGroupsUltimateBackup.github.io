The Dream follows The Harp of New Albion and is the composer&apos;s most significant work for keyboard in Just Intonation to date.</p><p>The texts for the *Beat Sutras*, sung in a style derived from North Indian classical music, draw on the beat poetry of Jack Kerouac and Michael McClure, who were two of the original beat poets from that 1950s movement. They, along with Gary Snyder, were among the first American poets to introduce Buddhist teachings in their writings and poetry.</p><p>--<br/>==========================================================================<br/>David B.
