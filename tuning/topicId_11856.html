But they&apos;re not just<br/>any old trees, they&apos;re perfect trees, all perfect cylinders exactly one unit<br/>in radius. And they&apos;re lined up in a grid, like on a tree farm. So you&apos;re<br/>standing in this perfect, imaginary forest, exactly on the spot a tree would<br/>be, if it were not missing, replaced by you. Now if you look around you<br/>notice some strange things. If you look parallel to the lines of trees,<br/>&quot;with the grain&quot; so to speak, you can see between the lines of trees forever<br/>(it&apos;s infinite, remember?). If you look at a 45 degree angle to the line,<br/>the trees form diagonal lines and you can also see infinitely that way. In<br/>fact, if you look at any tree close to you there will be a straight line of<br/>trees behind it and you can see through them. But if you look in a random<br/>direction, the trees won&apos;t form any lines and will obscure your view. Seem<br/>familiar? Okay, how about if some madman went around and tacked a sign on<br/>each tree with two numbers, how many trees up from you and how many over,<br/>with a slash between them, like a fraction. The tree in front of you has<br/>&quot;1/0&quot;, the one two your left has &quot;0/1&quot; the one up and to the right of you<br/>has &quot;1/1&quot;, the one to the right of that one has &quot;1/2&quot;, you get the idea. Now<br/>you notice that whenever a fraction is not in simplest form, it is hidden<br/>behind another tree that has the same fraction in simplest form (like, 4/6<br/>is behind 2/3). &quot;That&apos;s pretty neat&quot;, you think to yourself. Also, the<br/>closest tree in between two others has the mediant of the their two<br/>fractions. But that&apos;s still not the coolest part. Get this, the distance a<br/>tree is from you exactly corresponds to its musical consonance. How well you<br/>can see through the trees is harmonic entropy.</p><p>You might have to read that again to understand it,<br/>    Keenan P.</p></div><h3><a id=11869 href="#11869">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2000 6:43:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan Pepper wrote,</p><p>&gt;Okay, how about if some madman went around and tacked a sign on each tree<br/>&gt;with two numbers, how many trees up from you and how many over, with a<br/>&gt;slash between them, like a fraction.

S&apos;thinks you only need<br/>the upper-right (+,+) quadrant.  In which case, you&apos;ve got a strict<br/>&quot;lambdoma&quot; (like Partch&apos;s tonality diamond, but starting with 0/0 and<br/>proceeding by integer-limit instead of odd-limit).  And since this<br/>structure has a plane of mirror symmetry intersecting its line of 1/1&apos;s,<br/>you really only need the lower 45-degrees of the quadrant.</p><p>&gt;Also, the closest tree in between two others has the mediant of the their<br/>&gt;two fractions.</p><p>Closest tree?  Isn&apos;t it the middle tree, only working when there are an<br/>odd number of trees involved?</p><p>&gt;Get this, the distance a tree is from you exactly corresponds to its<br/>&gt;musical consonance.</p><p>Inversely, I&apos;m sure you meant.</p><p>For a fraction, a/b, that&apos;s sqrt(a^2 + b^2) -- an integer-limit version of<br/>the prime-factor measure you&apos;ve posted here before.  This new version also<br/>requires we ignore ratios that aren&apos;t in lowest form.</p><p>One interesting thing about this metric is that, like a numerator limit<br/>for proper fractions, it assigns very low consonance to some very wide<br/>intervals (like 7/1).  I guess it&apos;s a matter of definition what happens<br/>to consonance as intervals get very wide.  We&apos;re used to thinking of<br/>consonance and dissonance as mutually-exclusive inverses, but perhaps<br/>wide intervals are neither consonant or dissonant. . .</p><p>&gt;How well you can see through the trees is harmonic entropy.</p><p>Hurm!  This leaves a lot to the imagination -- perhaps you suggest using<br/>your distance metric of a given radius, instead of a Farey series of a<br/>given order, to obtain the initial template of ratios.  Since how well<br/>you see through depends on how far the target tree is from you (as you<br/>pointed out), this is not unreasonable.  In fact, it&apos;s been proposed on<br/>this list before.</p><p>IIRC, the Farey series was liked because the entropy curves it produces<br/>are well-behaved as its order is changed, and because a Farey series of<br/>a given order is a list of all the intervals in a harmonic series of a<br/>certain limit, and it is tempting to think that the ear/mind uses a<br/>harmonic series as _its_ template.  The a*b series also had some things<br/>going for it... none of which I can remember.  And I can&apos;t recall if<br/>sqrt(a^2 + b^2) was ever tried.
