I&apos;ve included examples<br/>of different scales for comparison: Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic scale (22-TET),<br/>1/4-comma meantone, just intonation, and the scale I described a few days<br/>ago, built from 388-cent major thirds and 312-cent minor thirds. I&apos;m<br/>tentatively calling it the &quot;starling scale&quot; after this song. I used Graham<br/>Breed&apos;s useful Midiconv utility to add the pitch bends to the MIDI files.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/marrgarrel.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/marrgarrel.html</a></p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=6367 href="#6367">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Let me give you my impressions of how the melody itself works<br/>in the various tunings. The scale you used is really a 7-tone one, which is<br/>commonly known as Alhijaz or the fifth mode of harmonic minor. In 22-tET<br/>it&apos;s 0 2 7 9 13 15 18 (22) (which happens to be a decatonic subset but<br/>you&apos;re not really using the decatonic scale here). One of the really awkward<br/>things about diatonic melodies in 22-tET is the succession of 3/22-oct. and<br/>4/22-oct. &quot;whole steps&quot;. Your main melody scrupulously avoids the 3/22-oct.<br/>step (and features the 4/22-oct. step in three places) by using scale degree<br/>7 only in the lower octave and scale degree 6 in the upper octave.<br/>Similarly, your meantone rendition of the scale, C C# E E# G G# A#, avoids<br/>the major second interval in the melody in favor of the three diminished<br/>thirds. Brilliant! I prefer the latter tuning because the E-G# interval is a<br/>nice pure major third, while in the 22-tET scale it&apos;s a full degree sharp.<br/>Less of a factor is that scale degree 4 sounds a little flat in the meantone<br/>version but not in the 22-tET version.</p><p>The JI version is just like the meantone version, melodically speaking, and<br/>the &quot;starling scale&quot; seems to capture the best melodic and harmonic aspects<br/>of all the other tunings for your piece. Nice work!</p></div>
