And because the diatonic scale is<br/>a chain of fifths, transposing it by a fifth changes only<br/>one note.  Therefore, keys farther from C in terms of<br/>transposition by fifths require more accidentals (one for<br/>each transposition).  If one wants notate scales with the<br/>fewest accidentals possible, one should spell them so that<br/>they are as close to C, in terms of transpositions by fifths,<br/>as possible.  So Bb is two fifths away from C, while A# is<br/>ten fifths away.  There may be reasons, in a piece of music,<br/>to notate something in A#, but for a diagram would just<br/>assume that most of the time, students will want to use Bb.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2005 10:25:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@yahoo.com">clumma@yahoo.com</a>&gt; writes:</p><p>&gt; If one wants notate scales with the<br/>&gt; fewest accidentals possible, one should spell them so that<br/>&gt; they are as close to C, in terms of transpositions by fifths,<br/>&gt; as possible.

Try the middle of the chain, and you are on save historical ground.</p><p>Our note naming scheme was built on a classification of Gregorian chants by interval content. It so happenend that all of them, or the simpler ones at least, could be derived from the same, almost(!) fixed collection of pitches, with four different final notes a tone, semitone and tone apart, and two different tessituras: either all above the final or with the final up a fourth from the lowest note. That&apos;s four finals with two different compasses for each one, or eight modes (differently from others on this list, I think of modes as ways of making music out of available tones, so the meaning extends beyond scale rotations to typical tessituras, places for turns in the melody, interval jumps and whatever else may be needed to give form to a tune in a given culture).</p><p>The lowest note to be considered is a fourth below the lowest of the four finals. They called it A and numbered the others alphabetically. When they stopped at G and restarted at the next octave, this scheme was almost up to date (~900 AD). It gives you the English (for example) note names. The final, to return to the issue of the &quot;true&quot; diatonic scale, is D. This mode has been called Hypodorian in the late Renaissance, but in the Middle Ages it was just the second mode (the first has all its notes in the octave above the final, D).</p><p>Further Complications Introducing a Bracelet of Fifths and Why Flats Look Like a B</p><p>Notes were referred to not by letter names and an octave number, but by these &quot;fixed&quot; names and their possible positions in a different, movable, system, the hexachord. The hexachord is a collection of two ditones (two Pythagorean thirds: ut-re-mi, fa-sol-la) joined by a semitone (&quot;mi contra fa, diabolus in musica&quot;). You&apos;ll recognize this as the origin of (for example) the Italian note names. They derive from the first syllables of the phrases of a chant in the first mode; ut is a C that approaches D. Originally, these notes were</p><p>C-ut, D-re, E-mi, F-fa, G-sol, and A-la.</p><p>Since some chants modulated, the hexachord could be transposed a fifth/fourth in either direction:</p><p>F-ut, G-re, A-mi, B-fa, C-sol, D-la and</p><p>G-ut, A-re, B-mi, C-fa, D-sol, E-la.</p><p>The hexachord on C doesn&apos;t touch B. The two transpositions do, and they give it noticibly different interpretations: as fa, it is a fourth above F, as mi, it is a third above G (and I am wondering whether it is clearer or more misleading to emphasize that it is a major third - there is no choice; a third at this position in the hexachord is always major). These hexachords were called mollis and durus (source of the German names for major and minor), and the notes themselves B rotundum and B quadratum. To differentiate them in tablatures, the b was written either round (&quot;b&quot;) or square (&quot;h&quot;, at least after tablatures were printed with letters), and eventually, they were called that, too (at least in Germany). And of course, the two Bs are the origin of the flat and natural, probably also the sharp sign.</p><p>Polyphonic music gradually introduced E-fa (with a B-fa-ut a fourth below) and other altered pitches. They were written without accidentals, however, but probably practised, at least analyzed, with the hexachord syllables - nobody was thinking about the circle of fifths. They took there cues from the note names: a D in the middle octave was re-sol-la; you arrived there with one solmisation syllable, but you might reinterpret - &quot;modulate&quot; - and continue in two different ways that might make your Es and Bs flat or natural. Extending the chain of fifths in the flat direction meant making a fa note the new ut, extending it towards the sharps meant making a sol note the new ut.</p><p>This is a different and more complicated story than the other answers you got, and I tried to make it short. You might want to have a closer look at topics like Gamut, Hexachord, or musica ficta.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2005 2:44:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The ionian mode was preferred for some reason, and then<br/>&gt; the notation was based around it (it was assigned to the<br/>&gt; naturals) because it was preferred.
