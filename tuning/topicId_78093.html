I<br/>rigged one up to Scala, but I couldn&apos;t figure out how to get it to<br/>control 19-tet or 31-tet or anything except 12-equal (which was<br/>probably due to a lack of knowledge on my part).

You talk about equal<br/>temperaments being pivot tunings.  You can also think of a higher-rank<br/>system as being the pivot tuning between two temperaments.  For<br/>example, write something in meantone and then something in magic.<br/>Make the transition work correctly in 5-limit just intonation.  Then<br/>you can modulate from meantone to JI to magic.
