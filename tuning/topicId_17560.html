I have labelled this &quot;The Harmonic<br/>Toolbox&quot; in my first liner notes,(ok, so I&apos;m groping for the immortality of<br/>coinage,there).<br/>    There is much to recommend the use of the well temperament as a palette<br/>of various colors.  I point to the WTC, in which Bach demonstrates various<br/>keys&apos; harmonic assests, ie, the Prelude in C places the melodic line on the<br/>overtones of the harmony in a very dulcet manner, or that the key of C#<br/>requires a different character of composition to turn its dissonant nature to<br/>good use. ( I use these two keys as example-extremis; the pieces in the<br/>&quot;middle&quot; keys can be played in several of the middle key signaures without<br/>changing their basic harmonic nature, and in fact, the record indicates that<br/>Bach did transpose them around a little.<br/>    OTOH, there are many ways for the &quot;energetic&quot; nature of a full comma<br/>third to be used and to be musically effective, and the style evidenced in<br/>the  C# Prelude was just one of them.  Since we may view the WTC 1 as not<br/>only a monumental work, but also a basic primer, perhaps Bach considered this<br/>the most characteristic approach to C#.  I don&apos;t have the musical<br/>underpinnings to discuss this much deeper, but I bet we have some list<br/>members that could take us further into the field, (I LOVE getting out in the<br/>tall weeds!)</p><p>&gt;     Also, in the question of dissonance, it is not that great a<br/>leap from the 1/6 comma meantones to the Kirnberger&apos;s  and<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s tunings, especially on the lower tension instruments<br/>of  his day.  Because a 1/6 comma tuning will provide for 8 keys with 6.4<br/>cent wide tonic thirds and the highest four keys ( B, F#, C# and G#)<br/>with tonic thirds of 28 cents, the line of demarcation is not so<br/>clearly drawn. A Werckmeister has three thirds out there at 21 cents.</p><p>Joseph again,<br/>I&apos;m assuming, then, that what you&apos;re saying is that at that point in<br/>time they were actually using 1/6 comma meantone, rather than 1/4<br/>comma... That&apos;s pretty crucial to the further development of &quot;well<br/>temperaments,&quot; therefore, yes??&lt;&lt;</p><p>    At any given point in time, there would have been a huge variety of<br/>tunings in any area. Standardization, as we came to know it in the ET<br/>dominated 20th century, was non-existant in the period between 1690-1850.<br/>     The gradual departure from meantone depended on the tuners themselves,<br/>and they were not a separate trade until the mid 1800&apos;s. Much keyboard tuning<br/>was done by choirmasters, teachers, instrument builders and owners, thus the<br/>plethorea of published &quot;self-instructions&quot; for tuning that constitute a large<br/>part of our historical research. The Montal instructions for ET of 1834 came<br/>in his booklet,&quot;How to tune your own Piano&quot;! From this, we may infer that<br/>tunings were in a state of flux, with the organ&apos;s seemingly the last to<br/>change,(they were the most expensive to change tunings, and were probably<br/>controlled by &quot;committee&quot;, thus slowing the acceptance of change).<br/>    So,  as composers heard the &quot;new&quot; music and began seeking the freedom<br/>allowed by banished wolves, trading the meantone purity for modulatory<br/>freedom was, indeed, becoming worth the extra effort required.  While it<br/>appears that the transition to well temperaments was in response to the need<br/>of modulation, the evolution from 1/4 to 1/6 meantone was done to improve the<br/>fifths, not necessarily to increase the tonal palette&apos;s range. Continuing on<br/>with this assumption, then we might expect the listening audience to have<br/>become accustomed to the more tempered thirds that resulted in the later<br/>meantones, paving the way for acceptance of Werckmeister&apos;s  ideas.  Then, it<br/>was on to the fin-de-sicle as well.  (getting to the point of elastic logic<br/>there, I know, but I think it is worth at least considering)</p><p>&gt;&gt;So what do you do regarding the use of PIANOS in your historical<br/>recordings?  I guess you mentioned that your recent release was on a<br/>MODERN grand.  Would this be the best way to listen to Beethoven, or<br/>would it even be MORE interesting to find a piano from that era?..&gt;&gt;</p><p>   Ah,  &quot;Why?.  The original style of instrument will best demonstrate the<br/>original sound,yes.  However, there are so few of them or their reproductions<br/>available, that the vast majority of this music is played, today, on the<br/>modern instrument.  I made the decision to push for forward movement by<br/>combining the keyboard du jour with the colors of the past, since there are<br/>more instruments around to which this concept can be applied. There are<br/>recordings of fortepianos in temperaments, but they seem to be regarded as<br/>curiosities. We are looking for a large-scale awakening,and for that, felt<br/>that the familiar axe should be the one that best illuminates the new<br/>approach to sharpening. (we may fall flat, but ya gotta swing for the fences,<br/>no?)<br/>   I suppose that the musical answer to the above question is best expressed<br/>by &quot;If you can&apos;t be with the one you love, love the one you&apos;re with&quot;.  That<br/>means approaching it from the &quot;Stein&quot; way.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=17575 href="#17575">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The<br/>full triad was the basic sonority in the early Renaissance, when 1/4-comma<br/>and 2/7-comma meantone temperament were used, as it was in the later Baroque<br/>when 1/6-comma meantone was in vogue. The change, I believe, had to do with<br/>the invention of tonality (as we know it today) in the Baroque era; tonality<br/>is predicated on the &quot;pointing&quot; action of the minor seconds in the diatonic<br/>scale; and 1/6-comma meantone makes the minor seconds more &quot;pointy&quot; than<br/>they are in 1/4- or 2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;Continuing on<br/>&gt;with this assumption, then we might expect the listening audience to have<br/>&gt;become accustomed to the more tempered thirds that resulted in the later<br/>&gt;meantones, paving the way for acceptance of Werckmeister&apos;s  ideas.</p><p>Yes -- I believe some of the historical evolution of aesthetic impressions<br/>as documented by Jorgenson lends plausibility to this idea.</p></div>
