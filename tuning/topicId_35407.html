The *shadings* were identical.  Except I<br/>stopped the graph when it hits black, in other words, not so much whether<br/>some interval miles away is accurate to whatever note it happens to fall<br/>near, but whether it could be *derived* from so many fourths or fifths plus<br/>or minus so many thirds which, I mentioned, in very large temperaments, at<br/>the pixel level, results in what looks like tubes with a seeming thickness<br/>and angle.  The colors I used were based on the RGB wheel.  But the shading<br/>was identical.

This is basically why I wanted to see<br/>this kind of shading scheme, to see how far a temperament could walk on its<br/>own with cycles of fifths and thirds.  And for that much, it has its own<br/>meditative purposes but I hope I didn&apos;t make them sound more important than<br/>just another one of those side studies.</p><p>&gt; so, i don&apos;t know ... my gut feeling is that these lattices are displaying some<br/>&gt; kind of valuable information about the relationship of equal-temperaments and<br/>&gt; JI. what i need to do is pursue this discussion until i figure out how to<br/>&gt; explain what that information is.</p><p>I should probably catch up a little and see what&apos;s been going on.</p><p>The lattices are useful, but if you&apos;re looking for a leg up over the<br/>mountain, it&apos;s ultimately just one reference scheme which if you stare at<br/>for too long, well, it can be addictive to get wrapped up in the crystal<br/>structure of multidimensional visions.</p><p>Anyhoo.

And there is nothing grating other than a modern predisposition.  Isacoff clearly has not heard the tuning.</p><p>This variegation&acirc;a kind of perspective through audible shading&acirc;was seized upon as a good thing by opponents of equal temperament, who saw in Werckmeister&acirc;s system the advantage of a built-in musical syntax.<br/>-----This happens after Werckmeister and after Bach, not during the Baroque.</p><p>Changes in a piece&acirc;s scales and harmonies were now overlaid with an added expressive element: a dramatic change in the quality of sound, depending on which tones the music revolved around at a given moment.<br/>-----Baroque composers were careful not to overexpose the foreign keys or chords.  Here Isacoff is at the tip of the iceberg regarding its potential expressivity.</p><p>(Of course, this change would only occur on keyboard instruments; strings and woodwinds were left to pursue their own musical grammars.)<br/>-----Poppycock.  Woodwinds always played, along with the strings of the Baroque, with the ever present keyboard.  There is no separate grammar.</p><p>Advocates claimed for well temperament the bonus of giving each key its own character; but for many, subjecting a keyboard to gradations of &acirc;in-and out-of-tuneness&acirc;&#x9D; offered little in the way of musical value.<br/>-----This is ignorance of the value of key character.  It shows up the value for melody &acirc;ala the Rousseau bit since the ecstatic free nature of melody is better represented.  And more in the way of musical value, not less.</p><p>Indeed, Werckmeister himself eventually became an advocate for equal temperament.<br/>-----This is a lie.  Werckmeister supported his chromatic tuning throughout his entire life, as I have previously exposed on this list.</p><p>The German critic and composer Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg&acirc;who, at the request of the heirs of Bach, wrote a preface for a new edition of the master&acirc;s &acirc;Art of Fugue&acirc;&#x9D;&acirc;offered a terse critique of the well-tempered system in 1776: Diversity in the character of the keys,&acirc;&#x9D; he wrote, &acirc;will serve only to increase a &acirc;diversity&acirc; of bad sounds in the performance.<br/>-----Marpurg was the director of the lottery and a bitter man.  He is writing against Kirnberger (who was supported by CPE Bach and others).</p><p>There is controversy to this day over whether Bach preferred equal or well temperament.  Some theorists contend that there is internal evidence in his music&acirc;differences in the way he handled different keys&acirc;to suggest he had well temperament in mind.<br/>-----Yet there is little by Isacoff to represent the &acirc;other&acirc;&#x9D; side fairly.</p><p>(One modern scholar insists that he has broken the code of Bach&acirc;s &acirc;secret tuning&acirc;&#x9D; by unraveling the images in the composer&acirc;s personal seal, which contained seven points and five dashes.  However, his secret solution conflicts with statements about temperament made by musicians in Bach&acirc;s circle.)<br/>-----Rather crude not to mention Herbert&acirc;s name.  Why not indicate what &acirc;conflicts&acirc;&#x9D; there were with statements in Bach&acirc;s circle?</p><p>There is as much evidence on the other side: Bach&acirc;s biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel reported, for example, that Bach moved so subtly through the keys that listeners never noticed the change; this suggests equal temperament.<br/>-----And yet Forkel is one of the clearest that Bach is not equal temperament.  None of this proves that Bach used anything different than Werckmeister.  Only Isacoff is suggesting ET.</p><p>His obituary made a similar comment about the artful way in which he tuned his instruments<br/>-----And tuning Werckmeister is MUCH faster than tuning 12-tET</p><p>What&acirc;s more, Bach used two different spellings of a single key for paired pieces in his Well-Tempered Clavier, as if to announce that he considered re-sharp and mi-flat equal.</p><p>Just couldn&acirc;t let this pass, best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 2:30:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 3/11/02 12:37 AM, &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; any other adherents besides Marc Jones?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; marc has demonstrated a clear understanding of temperaments, and<br/>i doubt he&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; ever agree that 12-equal is *just barely* diesic, or any of the<br/>other<br/>&gt; &gt; fallacies you&apos;ve posted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually I just got home from Beatlefest.

I took<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; as the name of a supercategory in which any number of any<br/>interval equalling another interval could be considered and correlated with<br/>other temperaments.  And Lo, I notice in the last couple of months,<br/>somewhere in the &quot;ticker&quot; of the tuning list, people are coming up with the<br/>same lists of temperaments, so.

I still haven&apos;t had a chance to catch up but.

A slightly custom<br/>color scheme pasted over the infinite sea, rather than the exact weight a<br/>temperament on its own can pull.  It&apos;s a different correlation.</p><p>Well if anything, it&apos;s a slight insight into the whole &quot;convergence web&quot;<br/>mindset.  That if you can use the Brun algorithm folding up octaves fifths<br/>thirds and say 13:12s to divine temperaments in which the *RELATIVE*<br/>inaccuracies of the intervals are drastically decreasing... Then... Well<br/>that was it.  One of my first thoughts was, well, you probably can get a lot<br/>of different intervals in these temperaments that YOU CAN DEFINE IN TERMS OF<br/>fifths thirds and 13:12s.</p><p>Also this seems to go back to this mutual desensitization I&apos;ve noticed<br/>between the sensitivity to temperament density VERSUS sensitivity to<br/>interval size.  Monz&apos; model seems to show the temperament as a grid, and<br/>wherever the sea has ripples, there they are; the fix on interval size.<br/>Mine shows the harmonic web of thirds and fifths against a temperament WEB<br/>of thirds and fifths; anything ignored would be &quot;blacker than black&quot;, more<br/>than one full note inaccurate.</p><p>&gt;&gt; which, I mentioned, in very large temperaments, at the pixel level, results<br/>&gt;&gt; in what looks like tubes with a seeming thickness and angle.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; is there any way you could let us see this?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah it wouldn&apos;t be too difficult.  Where?  Upload to the tuning files?</p><p>What&apos;s interesting is the tubes are infinite.  That meaning, that there are<br/>always smaller and smaller commas that so many fifths and thirds IN A<br/>TEMPERAMENT will always find a way of representing an interval by going so<br/>many fifths, THEN so many thirds, THEN so many fifths, just sort of<br/>zigzagging its way into umm... An almost serialist fractal.</p><p>It&apos;s not that complicated.  If you think about the ALMOST fibonacci way that<br/>smaller commas are revealed, in the Brun algorithm if nowhere else, you flip<br/>back and forth between (-x,y) and (x,-y) fifths and thirds which, if you<br/>think about PLOTTING them, gives you an angle that is constantly narrowing.<br/>So that&apos;s the direction of the tube.  The width???  I can&apos;t for the life of<br/>me.  I know it has something to do with the path perpendicular to the tube.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The colors I used were based on the RGB wheel.  But the shading was<br/>&gt;&gt; identical.  Which gave the &quot;tubes&quot; even more of a cylindrical look, because<br/>&gt;&gt; of the brightness in the middle and the black around the edges.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The lattices are useful, but if you&apos;re looking for a leg up over the<br/>&gt;&gt; mountain, it&apos;s ultimately just one reference scheme which if you stare at for<br/>&gt;&gt; too long, well, it can be addictive to get wrapped up in the crystal<br/>&gt;&gt; structure of multidimensional visions.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Anyhoo.  Like the &quot;left turn&quot; sign I mentioned.  If you&apos;re going to pursue<br/>&gt;&gt; the JI-vs-ET visualizations, well, I don&apos;t know.  I think you should maybe<br/>&gt;&gt; desensitize to the physical visual stimuli and keep trying to make different<br/>&gt;&gt; ones.
