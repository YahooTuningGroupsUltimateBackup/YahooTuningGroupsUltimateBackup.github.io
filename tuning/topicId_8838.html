If this were true, the &quot;high third&quot; would<br/>occasionally arrive at the ET tuning. It consistently doesn&apos;t, therefore the<br/>teeny little four cents(?) _is significant. Also, remember that these<br/>singers (although novices) are aware of the difference between acoustic<br/>(ear) tuning and piano pitch. I&apos;m very reluctant to buy this explanation. It<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to fit the experience as I have observed it.</p><p>Incidentally, my statement above was in the context of wishing more singers<br/>would become sensitive to &quot;ear&quot; tuning, i.e., JI. Also, remember that the<br/>singers who tend to sing the &quot;high third&quot; are _already sensitive to &quot;ear&quot;<br/>tuning and know not to &quot;settle&quot; for it. So, if you don&apos;t want to believe<br/>this we can drop this subject where it is. If you do believe me, you might<br/>want to rethink your conclusion that 12-tET influence is involved.</p><p>Perhaps this will be a matter to agree to disagree on, and thrill the hell<br/>out of Mr. Szanto. Your choice.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8840 href="#8840">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The theory suggests that the reason vocal music may<br/>have &quot;skipped over&quot; ratios involving numbers like 13 and learned to use<br/>numbers like 17 and 19 is because the latter are suggested by, even &quot;heard&quot;<br/>in, 12-tone equal temperament.</p></div>
