In particular, the interplay between harmonic and melodic use of &gt;&gt;the set in real, existing octatonic repertoire suggests that a high &gt;&gt;value is placed upon ambiguity and flexibility. But nevertheless, just &gt;&gt;intonations offer their own attractions.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&apos;t they, though?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Stravinsky, possibly from associations with folk repertoire, had a &gt;&gt;definite preference for melodic segments drawn from the octotonic &gt;&gt;collection rather than the complete set of eight tones. For example, one &gt;&gt;finds Mr. S. contrasting the use of four-tone segments: the diminished &gt;&gt;fourth (e.g. F# G A Bb) or the perfect fourth (G A Bb C). While many of &gt;&gt;Stravinsky&apos;s works depend upon such a large scale use of transpositions &gt;&gt;and modulations between diatonic and octatonic collection, a temperament &gt;&gt;may seem inevitable, trying out just interpretations of these smaller &gt;&gt;octatonic segments may well be suggestive at the local level. The same &gt;&gt;could be tried with Bartok&apos;s octatonic passages;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If one&apos;s goals are to create music that modulates &gt; widely, is it really possible to avoid modulation?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;James Tenney may have been the first to recommend tuning the complete &gt;&gt;octatonic up to a harmonic series segment implying octave multiples of &gt;&gt;the first seven primes: 1, 17, 19, 5, 11, 3, 13, 7.  While the accuracy &gt;&gt;and acceptabilty of this as a substitute for the tempered octatonic is &gt;&gt;debatable, this strikes me as especially resonant with the Skryiabiniste &gt;&gt;tradition (microtonalists know Wyschnegradsky, but Lourie, Obuchov, and &gt;&gt;- yes - Messiaen ought also be included in this grouping), in which a &gt;&gt;fixed set of pitches is used to provide the source for all melodic and &gt;&gt;harmonic activity.  A harmonic series segment, to my ears, provides a &gt;&gt;particularly stable -- if not static -- set of pitches from which to &gt;&gt;work in this way. ...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Has Tenney created music in this &quot;harmonic &gt; octatonic&quot;?<br/>&gt; I know that he has composed a lot of octatonic music, and his Chorales for orchestra are based upon harmonizing a diatonic melody with massively parallel octatonic chords, but I&apos;m not certain whether he&apos;s ever tuned the octatonic up or not.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;... Moreover, it seems to me that strategic use of &gt;&gt;inversions, for example, gradually allowing the more complex &gt;&gt;relationship to come into play (i.e. letting the 11, 13, 17, 19 emerge &gt;&gt;in the bass) can create some rather dynamic large scale structures that &gt;&gt;would be inaudible in a tempered rendition. ... &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea appeals.  Does &quot;can create&quot; mean &quot;has &gt; created&quot;? Do you have any example of this kind &gt; of large-scale work in the &quot;harmonic octatonic&quot;?<br/>&gt; Not, to my knowledge, in just intonation.  But similar strategies can be heard in some of Skryabin&apos;s late music (albeit tempered), or in the work of Kraig Grady, who sometimes uses inversions to deploy his just arrays.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;... (Let&apos;s agree: jokes these &gt;&gt;days about extraordinary renditions are off the table).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, don&apos;t get it.<br/>&gt; see:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Rendition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Rendition</a></p></div>
