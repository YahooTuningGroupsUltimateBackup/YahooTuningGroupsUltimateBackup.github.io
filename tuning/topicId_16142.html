That was a good-natured<br/>&gt;jab in the ribs for Carl L. and Robert W., who say that &quot;just&quot; is a<br/>&gt;verb, without offering any counter-examples of its usage as anything<br/>&gt;other than an adjective.</p><p>Where did I say it was a verb?  David, I&apos;m afraid you entirely missed<br/>the point of my very general comment.</p><p>[Dave Keenan wrote...]<br/>&gt;How about:<br/>&gt;-------------------------<br/>&gt;JI is tuning by harmonics<br/>&gt;-------------------------</p><p>One issue which has caused much confusion in this thread needs to<br/>be addressed -- the phrase &quot;just intonation&quot; is sometimes being<br/>used to mean a _scale_, and other times, a _sonority_.</p><p>The definition quoted from _Tetrachord_ is one of the former type,<br/>and one which even refers to a particular scale.  As John pointed<br/>out, there is excellent support for this definition -- in fact, it<br/>may be the most accurate definition outside of this community.</p><p>In order to generalize this definition for any scale, well... it&apos;s<br/>a damn challenge.  And the fruits of such a labor are probably non-<br/>existent.  Which is why I suggested we forget the idea, and stick<br/>to definitions of the latter type.  That is all my earlier post<br/>was trying to get across.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
