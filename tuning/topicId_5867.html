The unison vectors have<br/>to<br/>&gt;be chosen for some musical utility and I&apos;d like to see more discussion of<br/>&gt;that in postings about the topic.</p><p>In my original postings in this thread, I specifically identified the<br/>impetus for choosing a unison vector to be this (adapted from Kees van<br/>Prooijen): given the potentially unlimited set of pitches that n-dimensional<br/>JI provides, the simplest n intervals that are too small to represent a<br/>meaningful musical difference (in whatever musical context one may be<br/>operating) should be chosen as the unison vectors. My 1-D examples were: the<br/>limma; and then, given that the limma is to large to function as a UV in<br/>most contexts, a Pythagorean comma. My 2-D examples were: the syntonic comma<br/>and chromatic semitone; and then, given that the chromatic semitone is too<br/>large to function as a UV in most contexts, the syntonic comma and lesser<br/>diesis. If one wishes to recognize subcommatic distinctions, one would<br/>simply move on to the next periodicity blocks in the tables Kees has<br/>compiled (<a href="http://www.kees.cc/tuning/perbl.html">http://www.kees.cc/tuning/perbl.html</a>). Also, I&apos;ve mentioned that<br/>Kees&apos; tables miss some musically viable periodicity blocks in which no two<br/>notes are separated by an intervals smaller than any of the UVs.</p></div>
