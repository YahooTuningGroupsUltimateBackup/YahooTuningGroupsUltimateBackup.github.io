Having tried my hand on learning the &apos;kanun&apos;<br/>long time ago I am a bit familiar with the terminology used for small<br/>intervals. I can also understand the frantic search for a deterministic<br/>scale that will explain everything under the sun. After endless<br/>frustrations in learning the kanun and not being able to produce<br/>consistently the scales used by legendary masters such as Tanburi Cemil Bey<br/>I began<br/>questioning the theoretical models that were being used at the time. This<br/>led me to the research I am conducting currently. The distributions I am<br/>referring to are sometimes 80 cents wide, which would be considered<br/>significantly beyond a vibrato or a coloration of any sort. My perception<br/>that Turkish music has memory is endorsed by people of respect in the<br/>musical arena in Turkey. This seemingly stochastic pattern certainly<br/>contains intrinsic just intervals at the local/micro level, as suggested by<br/>Karadeniz, Arel, and others in different forms. However, the situation at<br/>the macro level seems to be much more involved than a simple just scale. I<br/>would be very much interested in hearing your expert opinion on my<br/>pedestrian ideas in looking for non-deterministic models that might<br/>characterize the scales for various &apos;maqam&apos;s in a &apos;fuzzy&apos; yet realistic<br/>manner.

The one thing that I could suggest at the moment is to<br/>include something like Barlow&apos;s scale step property, where the acceptance<br/>of one interval identity does not conflict with the identification of other<br/>scale members by crowding the tolerance space around them.
