But I&apos;m pleased that Pete doesn&apos;t<br/>  try to make a little tin god out of you, too.  For God&apos;s sake,<br/>  Erv Wilson, however wonderful a person he may be (and probably<br/>  is, from the little I&apos;ve read) is still a human being.  It&apos;s too easy<br/>  to carry humility and reverence so far that it incapacitates us<br/>  from _doing_ anything ourselves.</p><p>  Still, most of us need heroes, don&apos;t we?  It&apos;s just that some of<br/>  us know ourselves so well, that we are simply astounded every<br/>  day by our own brilliance, and thus can serve as our own r&ocirc;le<br/>  models!  (Speaking strictly for myself, of course :-) ...)</p><p>  I won&apos;t begin to enumerate my many dazzling qualities here,<br/>  my scholarly, musical, artistic, mathematical and pedagogical<br/>  feats, or even those personal attributes that charm vipers,<br/>  for fear of being castigated for a lack of seemly humility.<br/>  Besides which, it might blind some lesser lights, so much so<br/>  that they begin to waste my time and theirs in making<br/>  unnecessary pilgrimages to grovel at my feet in silent awe;<br/>  when instead they could be taking their _own_ lights out from<br/>  under the bushel.</p><p>  In case you hadn&apos;t guessed by now, my theme song is:<br/>  &quot;Oh Lord!  It&apos;s hard to be humble.&quot;</p><p>  Regards,<br/>  Yahya</p><p>  -----Original Messages (19, 21, 22 of the digest)-----<br/>  ________________________________________________________________________</p><p>  Message: 19<br/>     Date: Wed, 9 Mar 2005 11:05:27 +0200<br/>     From: &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot;<br/>  Subject: Re: Re: Erv Wilson</p><p>  I can read Arabic and can you a lot of things about quasars and supernovas,<br/>  but I don&apos;t see anyone astonished at my e-presence... ;)<br/>    ----- Original Message -----<br/>    From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>    To: tuning<br/>    Sent: 09 Mart 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 0:21<br/>    Subject: [tuning] Re: Erv Wilson</p><p>    --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pete McRae &lt;ambassadorbob@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    &gt; It&apos;s quite engaging, really.

Nevertheless I take pride in my<br/>  oratorial skills in other languages (transliterated in latin).</p><p>  There are several treatises in Arabic awaiting translation at the moment<br/>  though. This calls for a scholarly teamwork. I stand ready to do an analysis<br/>  on any treatise once its fully and correctly prepared in either English or<br/>  Turkish.</p><p>  BTW, I&apos;m an astronomy fan and have here a huge atlas of astronomy relased by<br/>  the Cambridge University that I can refer to. In regards to music, I was<br/>  very intrigued by the solor scale. Fascinating, how the planets are<br/>  aligned...</p><p>  Cordially,<br/>  Ozan<br/>    ----- Original Message -----<br/>    From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>    To: tuning<br/>    Sent: 09 Mart 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 11:30<br/>    Subject: [tuning] Re: Erv Wilson</p><p>    --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    &gt; I can read Arabic and can you a lot of things about quasars and<br/>    supernovas, but I don&apos;t see anyone astonished at my e-presence... ;)</p><p>    Maybe they should be; if you want to fill us in on music theory<br/>    translated from Arabic I think a lot of people would be all ears.
