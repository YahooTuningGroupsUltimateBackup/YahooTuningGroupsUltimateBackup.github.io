Note his preoccupation with a &quot;perfect city&quot; to which the perfect citizen must comply. There are also comments in his writing showing his support for slavery and that this institution is &apos;natural&quot;  Karl Popper has written an entire volume on Plato and showing his support for totalitarianism and his opposition to an open society. See The Open Society and its Enemies ( one of the ten best books i have read-both volumes). That Plato and McClain ends up with 12 ET, means we are probably on the right track.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
