It was either<br/>spinning up or spinning down, I can&apos;t remember which, but the effect was<br/>fantastic.  At the time I did not have the sensibilities to register the<br/>harmonics, but for sure there were a lot of them.  But I was sad to realize<br/>that I would probably never hear the sound again (and so far I haven&apos;t).  It<br/>was totally space filling between some large industrial buildings.  Maybe it<br/>was not actually a branch cutter but some wood-demolition device for tearing<br/>buildings down - just realizing this now - it was around the time that a<br/>large wrecking ball was there in the same vicinity.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; THIS WAS   W E I R D   !!!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/post?act=reply&messageNum=45467">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/post?act=reply&messageNum=45467</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; i just experienced the weirdest thing.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 5 minutes ago (6:45 am PDT) there began a<br/>&gt;&gt; roaring in sky, which i figured was just a<br/>&gt;&gt; jet plane going by overhead.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; my neighborhood is not very close to any<br/>&gt;&gt; of the direct routes to the airport, so<br/>&gt;&gt; i don&apos;t generally hear jets at home.  but<br/>&gt;&gt; there are all manner of aircraft flying<br/>&gt;&gt; around San Diego, so i didn&apos;t rule it out<br/>&gt;&gt; right away ...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; but it was very strange, first of all because<br/>&gt;&gt; it seemed to last a very long time, and<br/>&gt;&gt; then because i could hear soft tones with<br/>&gt;&gt; very clear harmonic proportions in it, mainly<br/>&gt;&gt; 10:12:15:16, and there were a couple of other<br/>&gt;&gt; notes between 12:15 that sometimes sounded like<br/>&gt;&gt; 14, sometimes like 13.5 (= 27), sometimes like<br/>&gt;&gt; something else.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; THIS WAS WEIRD!!!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; then after about a whole minute or perhaps<br/>&gt;&gt; even a bit longer, it slowly faded away.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; THEN AFTER ANOTHER MINUTE IT RETURNED!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; exactly as before.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; DID ANYONE ELSE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HEAR THIS?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
