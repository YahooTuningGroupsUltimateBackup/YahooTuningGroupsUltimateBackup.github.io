Its &quot;major 3rd&quot; is of course the 5:4<br/>&gt; ratio = ~386.3137139 cents.  Its &quot;whole-tone&quot; is ~193.1568569<br/>&gt; cents, which is *precisely* the mean between the 9:8 and 10:9<br/>&gt; ratios. This is the only tuning which can be labeled *exactly*<br/>&gt; as &quot;mesotonic&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But while 1/4-comma meantone was indeed very popular during the<br/>&gt; 1500s and 1600s, it was far from being the exclusive &quot;meantone&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning employed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the mid-1600s 1/4-comma had fallen out of general favor and was<br/>&gt; usually replaced by 1/6-comma meantone or its equivalent 55-EDO:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Sauveur ... said the 55 division was &quot;the one which ordinary<br/>&gt;&gt; musicians use&quot; [Sauveur 1711, p 315].<br/>&gt;&gt; ...<br/>&gt;&gt; Sauveur&apos;s remarks when taken together with other pertinent<br/>&gt;&gt; evidence [from p 54, regarding 1/5-comma meantone; see<br/>&gt;&gt; quote below] suggest that the 1/4-comma temperament is not<br/>&gt;&gt; the most valid model for a menatone system of his day.<br/>&gt;&gt; It had been the theorists&apos; favourite model, however, during<br/>&gt;&gt; the period between Zarlino&apos;s _Dimostrationi harmoniche_<br/>&gt;&gt; (1570) and Mersenne&apos; _Harmonie Universelle_ (1637), and<br/>&gt;&gt; presumably it was used a good deal during that period, even<br/>&gt;&gt; though one writer said in 1613 [Cerone 1613, p 1049] that<br/>&gt;&gt; master organ builders used a meantone temperament with the<br/>&gt;&gt; major 3rds larger than pure.&quot;  [Lindly/Turner-Smith 1993, p 149]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 1/6-comma meantone the &quot;5th&quot; is calculated as<br/>&gt; ( (3/2) / (81/80)^(1/6) ) = ~698.3706193 cents<br/>&gt; (nearly identical to 55-EDO... see<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm</a>&gt;).<br/>&gt; The &quot;major 3rd&quot; of 1/6-comma meantone = ~393.4824771 cents,<br/>&gt; or ~7.168763199 cents wider than that of 1/4-comma meantone<br/>&gt; (which is the &quot;pure&quot; 5:4).  Under certain conditions this<br/>&gt; could be an audible difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 55-EDO &quot;5th&quot; is 2^(32/55) = ~698.1818182 cents.  Its<br/>&gt; &quot;major 3rd&quot; is 2^(18/55) = ~392.7272727 cents, and its<br/>&gt; &quot;whole-tone&quot; is 2^(9/55) = ~196.3636364 cents.</p><p>And a bit further on:</p><p>&gt; But Zarlino himself advocated 2/7-comma meantone earlier than,<br/>&gt; and as superior to, 1/4-comma!  I quote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;... the oldest quantitatively coherent account of a meantone<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament is Zarlino&apos;s description (1558) of a tuning in<br/>&gt;&gt; which the major (and minor) 3rds are smaller than pure<br/>&gt;&gt; by 1/7 of the syntonic comma, and so the 5ths are tempered<br/>&gt;&gt; by 2/7 comma ...<br/>&gt;&gt; In 1571 Zarlino published a scheme which several later<br/>&gt;&gt; theorists took as their only model of meantone temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; (although by the end of the 17th century, it may have been<br/>&gt;&gt; used less than tunings with the major 3rds tempered larger<br/>&gt;&gt; than pure) ...<br/>&gt;&gt; But Zarlino through the 1570s and &apos;80s still liked the sound<br/>&gt;&gt; of his original 2/7-comma meantone temperament as well...<br/>&gt;&gt; Near the other limit which we have determined for a meantone<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament lies this possibility: [1/6-comma meantone].<br/>&gt;&gt; And there is an obvious intermediate possibility [1/5-comma<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone]...

Historically, composers never<br/>specified that they were writing &quot;in meantone&quot;. &quot;Meantone&quot; itself is<br/>a word that has come into use more recently than the actual meantone<br/>era. In the 16th and most of the 17th centuries, and for non-keyboard<br/>instruments for most of the 18th century, what we today call meantone<br/>was simply called &quot;correct intonation&quot;. One recognized feature of<br/>this was that the notes that we today consider to be &quot;enharmonically<br/>equivalent&quot; were supposed to be performed as different pitches. G# is<br/>lower than Ab, D# is lower than Eb, etc. In fact, the<br/>name &quot;enharmonic&quot; comes from the fact that in the Renaissance, many<br/>theorists were interested in ancient Greek scales, including the<br/>enharmonic scale which featured quartertones. In a typical<br/>Renaissance tuning, all the pairs of &quot;enharmonic equivalents&quot; are in<br/>fact a quartertone apart (e.g., 50.3 cents in 2/7-comma meantone; 48<br/>cents in 50-tET). Many keyboards had split black keys or other<br/>mechanisms to allow for the performance of a piece with both G#s and<br/>Abs, for example. In most cases, though, keyboard works in this era<br/>were written with no more than 12 distinct pitches, so it would be up<br/>to the performer to look over the piece and tune the keyboard<br/>accordingly. In some cases, an Ab might appear in passing even though<br/>a G# was used prominently elsewhere in the piece -- in this case, the<br/>keyboard would be typically tuned to include G# but not Ab (unless<br/>there were split keys).</p><p>I&apos;m rambling . . . let me know if you have any other questions.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=26734 href="#26734">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/6/2001 1:04:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26689.html#26728">/tuning/topicId_26689.html#26728</a></p><p>Many keyboards had split black keys or other<br/>&gt; mechanisms to allow for the performance of a piece with both G#s<br/>and Abs, for example.

Joe Pehrson, I would warmly encourage<br/>you to continue using this tuning for your Shakespearean setting, with<br/>the following discussion intended to place this choice in a certain<br/>historical and theorical context.</p><p>One point recently made by Mark Lindley in a number of articles, but<br/>not always adequately emphasized when specific fractions of a comma of<br/>tempering are discussing, is that the process of temperament or<br/>_participatio_ was likely in use for about a century before it got<br/>mathematically defined by Zarlino (1558).</p><p>One might guess that the transition from Pythagorean tuning for<br/>keyboards to meantone took place in many parts of Europe around<br/>1450-1480; and various sources around 1496-1555 either describe the<br/>practice of tuning fifths narrower than pure in general terms, or give<br/>specific but not rigorously mathematical instructions for negotiating<br/>this practice. It is Zarlino, however, who first describes tempering<br/>or _participatio_ in terms of fractions of a syntonic comma -- his own<br/>2/7-comma meantone in 1558, and also in 1571 the alternatives of<br/>1/4-comma meantone and 1/3-comma meantone (pure minor thirds).</p><p>While Lindley correctly asserts that Pietro Aaron (1523) does not<br/>specify 1/4-comma meantone, I would myself conclude that Aaron&apos;s<br/>procedure may easily -- although not inevitably -- be read to achieve<br/>the same result. He urges tuning the major third C-E &quot;as just and<br/>sonorous&quot; as possible, and then tuning a chain four equally impure<br/>fifths C-G-D-A-E.</p><p>Lindley ably argues that this tuning of the first five notes does not<br/>_necessarily_ imply that other notes should be tuned in exactly the<br/>same way; and he shows how Aaron&apos;s instructions  _can_ cleverly be<br/>interpreted to call for different degrees of temperament of certain<br/>other fifths. However, Aaron&apos;s text, addressed to musical novices in<br/>the Italian vernacular, at least suggests how a meantone with pure<br/>major thirds might often have been tuned without a specific<br/>mathematical focus on fractions of a syntonic comma.</p><p>At the same time, other theorists of the era describe either what may<br/>be regular meantones with major thirds wider than 5:4 (and less<br/>heavily tempered fifths), or what might be called &quot;irregular&quot; tunings<br/>(e.g. Arnold Schlick, 1511).</p><p>Also, while Zarlino is the first to _define_ 2/7-comma, 1/4-comma, and<br/>1/3-comma meantone in terms of fractions of a comma, certain other<br/>theorists do describe tuning systems that imply temperaments at or<br/>very close to such tunings, although defined in other ways.</p><p>Thus Vicentino (1555), in describing a tuning for his archicembalo or<br/>superharpsichord where the octave is divided into 31 conceptually<br/>equal &quot;minor dieses&quot; or fifthtones, suggests something very close to<br/>1/4-comma meantone. The constraining factor here is that a chromatic<br/>semitone is divided into two essentially equal diesis or fifthtone<br/>steps, an effect featured in his experimental music.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone -- or, &quot;a meantone with pure major thirds&quot; --<br/>a chromatic semitone of around 76 cents is divided into fifthtones of<br/>around 41 cents and 35 cents, fitting the apparent intentions of his<br/>music as well as his theoretical system.</p><p>Likewise Guillaume Costeley (1570) describes a system dividing the<br/>octave into 19 equal &quot;thirdtones,&quot; almost exactly equivalent to<br/>1/3-comma meantone with pure 6:5 minor thirds.</p><p>Where more experimental music of the era relies on such larger gamuts,<br/>the precise degree of meantone can become more constrained than for<br/>usual music involving 12-16 notes per octave, where the choice may be<br/>largely one of taste.</p><p>Thus Zarlino himself, while advocating 2/7-comma meantone, recognizes<br/>that 1/4-comma is pleasant and not difficult to tune, and finds<br/>1/3-comma somewhat &quot;languid&quot; (a kind of description he also applies to<br/>the simple minor third or the division of the fifth with the minor<br/>third below the major third).</p><p>Interestingly, while Zarlino&apos;s former student Vincenzo Galilei takes<br/>many radical views on theory at odds with his teacher, he agrees that<br/>2/7-comma meantone is the most pleasant tuning for keyboard<br/>instruments.</p><p>In Spain, Cerone (1613) reports that an organ tuning with major thirds<br/>wider than pure is the practice -- and Lindley recommends a<br/>temperament somewhere around 1/5-comma meantone as pleasing for some<br/>pieces around 1600.</p><p>Given all this variety, I might just offer a few practical<br/>suggestions.</p><p>       (1) Generally 1/4-comma meantone seems to me a delightful<br/>           starting point, and a quite acceptable &quot;default,&quot; for<br/>           most 16th-century keyboard music -- not to exclude<br/>           other alternatives.</p><p>       (2) For most &quot;usual&quot; pieces involving not more than 12-16<br/>           notes per octave, any meantone in the range of around<br/>           1/3-comma to 1/6-comma _might_ represent a period<br/>           keyboard realization in some region of Europe or<br/>           tuning tradition.</p><p>       (3) For a few specialized or more experimental pieces,<br/>           considerations such as the division of a chromatic<br/>           semitone into two equal or quasi-equal fifthtones<br/>           (Vicentino), or of the octave into 19 equal<br/>           thirdtones (Costeley), point to a specific kind of<br/>           tuning model.</p><p>       (4) As Mark Lindley has remarked, if one has easy access<br/>           to two or more degrees of meantone, then trying the<br/>           same piece in each tuning and seeing which &quot;sounds<br/>           best&quot; is about as good a method as any -- with<br/>           differences of taste not at all unlikely.</p><p>While there are vertical and melodic fine points which we can discuss<br/>at length -- again subject to taste -- I find it not unlikely in<br/>practice that the same organ piece, for example, might be performed in<br/>1/4-comma somewhere in Naples; in 2/7-comma around Venice; and<br/>possibly in 1/5-comma in Madrid. Within each region, also,<br/>temperaments might have varied considerably, whether through<br/>deliberate exercise of taste or assorted forms of imprecision, some<br/>possibly quite artful.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=26868 href="#26868">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/10/2001 7:30:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26689.html#26848">/tuning/topicId_26689.html#26848</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, everyone, and I&apos;d mainly like to reply to some<br/>questions about Renaissance meantone temperaments and the range of<br/>options discussed by writers in this era.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, I would say that 1/4-comma meantone (with pure 5:4<br/>major thirds) is a fine choice for Elizabethan music, and likely to<br/>fit most 16th-century music quite nicely.

John Bull&apos;s famous piece based on hexachord transitions<br/>might be played on such a keyboard in Cb-E#, as I recall -- tune the<br/>usual B# key a diesis higher to Cb, or use a larger tuning with both<br/>notes already included, and you have the basis for a fascinating<br/>period interpretation.</p><p>Of course, with a larger subset of 31, or all 31, you can do<br/>Vicentino&apos;s &quot;enharmonic genus&quot; with its fifthtone steps (here<br/>precisely 1/31 octave).</p><p>An attraction of 31 (or 1/4-comma) which Vicentino himself favors in<br/>the &quot;proximate minor&quot; or neutral third at around 11:9.</p><p>In my view, either 1/4-comma meantone or 31-tET could be described as<br/>a &quot;31-tone&quot; or &quot;fifthtone&quot; system, and either provides a valid<br/>realization of Vicentino&apos;s system.
