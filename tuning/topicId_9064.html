Same goes for sevenths. I agree that there is great fluidity in the<br/>&gt; intonation of these intervals but these seem to me to be two completely<br/>&gt; different categories of &quot;blue thirds&quot;.</p><p>Another way to say the same thing is that some blues music includes thirds<br/>that are not &quot;blue thirds.&quot; :-)</p><p>To me, blue thirds are, by definition, lower (smaller) than minor thirds. I<br/>have no problem with the notion of &quot;neutral thirds&quot; (now that it has been<br/>defined for me), but these cannot possibly be aurally confused with what I<br/>have been calling &quot;blue thirds.&quot;</p><p>So, just to clarify, I did not &quot;claim&quot; that the blue third _is_ 7:6. I<br/>simply expressed that, for me, the ratio 6:7 is about as close to what I<br/>perceive the common practice of blues performers to be in regard to their<br/>use of a third that is smaller than the minor third.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=9065 href="#9065">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

By the way, Jerry, from your responses to the minor triad examples it<br/>seems that you like a &quot;minor third&quot; 18-23&#xFFFD; flat relative to 5:6 (but not as<br/>low as your &quot;blue third&quot;) as much as you like a &quot;high major third&quot; relative<br/>to 4:5, if not more so.

Any thoughts?</p><p>First let me say that the minor triad experiment was very helpful and<br/>informative. Thanks very much for providing it. It is interesting to me (and<br/>to you as well, I would think) that I did not initially &quot;prefer&quot; the JI<br/>minor triad. When I repeated the listening the next day (before seeing your<br/>&quot;solutions&quot;), I actually preferred the one next closer to the JI. Perhaps if<br/>I had repeated the listening one more day I might have gotten it &quot;right.&quot;<br/>LOL</p><p>However, I wouldn&apos;t make any hard conclusions on the basis of my response.<br/>I, like Carl (I think), noted that when you turn your head from side to side<br/>the pitches seemed to &quot;float&quot; a bit. Perhaps the timbre contributed to that<br/>effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You also found that a really low minor third, but 15&#xFFFD; higher than 6:7, best<br/>&gt; evoked the sixth and seventh partials of a missing fundamental. Perhaps your<br/>&gt; &quot;blue third&quot; is as far from 6:7 as your &quot;minor third&quot; is from 5:6 and your<br/>&gt; &quot;high major third&quot; is from 4:5?</p><p>Paul, remember that this listening exercise involved _triads_, not<br/>intervals. And as we know, the position of thirds can be affected by the<br/>simultaneous sounding of the fifth. I assure you that my perception of<br/>isolated pure intervals is far more consistent than my &quot;preference&quot; for<br/>minor triads. I have done the &quot;sliding thing&quot; enough times to be able to<br/>hear the pure low-number intervals lock. In that sense, I believe &quot;my&quot;<br/>major, minor and subminor thirds are those of natural acoustics. (Do I sense<br/>a challenge in the works? :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
