Two that<br/>jumped out at me (naturally) concerned mention of Mahler&apos;s<br/>symphonies in the footnotes.</p><p>Even more intriguing was Swafford&apos;s statement that Brahms<br/>had looked at Schoenberg&apos;s _Quartet in D-major_, which was<br/>supposedly written summer 1897 - a couple of months *after*<br/>Brahms died!  Swafford got it from McDonald, who quoted it<br/>from Hanns Eisler, who studied with Schoenberg himself,<br/>so there...  Apparently the quartet was written a bit earlier,<br/>and *all* the references to it are incorrect about the date!</p><p>So overall, I&apos;d agree with Joe that Swafford should be taken<br/>seriously.  The sheer volume of data in his books shows that<br/>at least he&apos;s uncovering and/or assembling lots of info.<br/>Altho in the case of Ives, Johnny may well know more than<br/>Swafford.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
