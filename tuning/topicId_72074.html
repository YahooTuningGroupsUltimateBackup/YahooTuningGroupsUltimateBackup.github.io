Here&apos;s another CPE quote I like, from &quot;The New Bach Reader,&quot; P. 9...&quot;He was never a friend of dry, mathematical stuff&quot; (preceeding this quote, the author points out that  &quot;Carl Philipp Emanuel expressly stated-referring to the discussions of proportions and temperaments of which certain contemporaries were particularly fond that...&quot;). Sounds like the Maestro wouldn&apos;t have liked this list much at all. He created great art, and left the chatting about the decimal points to others.<br/>   On a related note, many theorists have wondered over the years about the way Indian music is tuned, and the 22 srutis often appear as a possible method. I recently chatted with a sarod player who has studied with Ali Akbar Khan for several years, and asked her if he said anything to her about it. She replied that he wasn&apos;t that interested in theory, and preferred that people learn the ragas by doing them, learning to feel where the proper intervals were located. I found that very enlightening...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>   <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div>
