This sounds<br/>like one of H. L. Mencken&apos;s spoofs on politics. But if it is true, we&apos;ve<br/>reached a pretty damned sad day. To be fair, maybe someone should propose a<br/>ban on human expression altogether.<br/>&gt;Delivered-To: <a href="mailto:jaywill@tscnet.com">jaywill@tscnet.com</a><br/>&gt;Date: Sun, 23 Jun 2002 22:33:53 -0700<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:othermindslist@otherminds.org">othermindslist@otherminds.org</a><br/>&gt;From: Charles Amirkhanian &lt;<a href="mailto:charles@artsplural.com">charles@artsplural.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Anti-serial music bill threatens academic concerts<br/>&gt;Reply-To: <a href="mailto:othermindslist@otherminds.org">othermindslist@otherminds.org</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In addition to the Anti-Rave bill, California music lovers are about<br/>&gt;to be rocked with another major upheaval-an impending move to limit<br/>&gt;dissonant music from San Diego to Yreka.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Renowned composer Edwin Dugger has resigned his post at UC Berkeley<br/>&gt;Music Department suddenly to organize and lead the opposition to a<br/>&gt;new movement called The Tone Custers.  These self-styled proponents<br/>&gt;of easy listening fare have mounted a new initiative in the<br/>&gt;California State Legislature to reduce 12-tone concert music<br/>&gt;performances by 50% over the coming three years throughout the state.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The movement, led by descendants of the late Elliot Griffes, has<br/>&gt;taken the academic world by surprise, but Dugger vows to uphold the<br/>&gt;freedoms of Perspectives of New Music analysts from coast to coast.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;A win for the opposition in a bellweather state like California<br/>&gt;could start a domino effect that would deep-six my entire output and<br/>&gt;that of countless other composers of minority music,&quot; Dugger<br/>&gt;observes.  &quot;If they want to further their career as mental<br/>&gt;vegetables, let them do it in the privacy of their own dining rooms.<br/>&gt;Why suppress the occasional squirrel pie or deep fried grasshopper in<br/>&gt;the process?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A spokesperson for the anti-12-tone legislation countered,<br/>&gt;&quot;Minimalism was born in California. Let&apos;s put our money where it<br/>&gt;belongs:  just this side of the ether.  It just doesn&apos;t make sense to<br/>&gt;promote Austro-German hegemony with so many hard-earned dollars here<br/>&gt;in the Golden State.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2002 11:05:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jay,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Jay Williams &lt;jaywill@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; My response to the following: he&apos;s gotta be kidding, got he?</p><p>I know Charles Amirkanian and I&apos;ll write him to see what&apos;s up.

If it isn&apos;t, anyone who resigns from a salaried position to man the barricades against serialism (and all the piles of money *that* kind of gig will bring in) is sort of humorous, anyway...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
