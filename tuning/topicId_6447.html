Some of the group is still here and a workshop or series of workshops may be offered in January, no definite dates yet. (I called again yesterday after posting the message.)<br/>Thanks for the additional comments, with which I agree.  Also, what they called mode three is Dorian, one of the easier to sing of some 31 modes they use out of a still larger number.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; David Beardsley &lt;<a href="mailto:xouoxno@home.com">xouoxno@home.com</a>&gt; 11/30 12:05 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>From: David Beardsley &lt;<a href="mailto:xouoxno@home.com">xouoxno@home.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&quot;John F.
