So far only three of the ten offerings are microtonal - the remainder are in (gasp! sob) 12tet, for which I abjectly apologize. But So Many Little Dyings and the Sitting Bull movement of Custer are there - surely familiar to you all from my long-available CD - and also three scenes from my microtonal chamber opera Cinderella&apos;s Bad Magic, never before heard except live in Russia and at Bard College. Tuning charts are supplied. Enjoy! (not just a suggestion).</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2003 10:54:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ohmygod - a post about music!
