OneList is the company that mutated into eGroups and then Yahoo<br/>Groups.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d say symptoms don&apos;t look that good at present with all the things<br/>&gt; they seem to be doing to try and get some revenue from it - unless they<br/>&gt; can figure out some way of earning from it while keeping it free and<br/>&gt; not causing too much hassle in the way of advertisements<br/>&gt; - one can understand their dilemma ! Naturally it will be because of the<br/>&gt; large drop recently, last year, in the amount advertisers are willing<br/>&gt; to pay to host an advert on a web site (was it ten-fold,<br/>&gt; or hundred-fold??).</p><p>Not only the fall in advertising revenues, but the evaporation of the .com<br/>boom.  When advertising was expensive, web sites were allowed to borrow<br/>huge sums of money to establish market share.  They&apos;re now expected to be<br/>showing a profit -- exactly when they should be borrowing to get over the<br/>bad times.</p><p>&gt; Just one thing to consider - for the long term, perhaps many years<br/>&gt; ahead.<br/>&gt; Universities and colleges don&apos;t close down often, but they do<br/>&gt; sometimes change their policies. But then so do commercial sites<br/>&gt; and they are perhaps more volatile being dependent on advertising.</p><p>Yes, the list had to move from Mills because of a policy change.  That<br/>wasn&apos;t a problem.  We can do it again.</p><p>&gt; We can migrate whenever needed, and I don&apos;t see it is of any great<br/>&gt; significance where we actually post to. Having unlimited files<br/>&gt; area will be great!</p><p>One thing not mentioned yet is that Yahoo claim a non-transferable<br/>copyright on the archives.  That means they can only be salvaged by your<br/>opt-in method (as the copyright is also non-exclusive).  An alternative<br/>provider might allow some sensible right to re-distribute.  Usenet<br/>effectively works like this (although there&apos;s no explicit license) which<br/>is why Google can run the archive, but you can still stop somebody quoting<br/>large chunks of your posts in a book (probably).  The longer our posts<br/>accumulate in an archive without this flexibility, the more we&apos;ll lose if<br/>something does go wrong.  I don&apos;t know what Columbia&apos;s policy is.</p><p>                         Graham</p></div>
