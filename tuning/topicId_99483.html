However, long before I noticed this I had fun with a similar pump in miracle temperament. If for example you start with [0 0 0] and proceed by [0 0 i] until [0 0 15], then in miracle you get a comma pump, returning to [0 0 0] as the equivalent chord [1 0 15]. The set of all the notes of such chords, tempered in miracle, spans the miracle gamut from -7 to 13 secors, which gives 21 successive miracle generators, in other words Blackjack (Miracle[21].) This means the corresponding comma, (15/4)^7/(8/5) = |-10 7 8 -7&gt;, is a comma of miracle which I think should be called the blackjackisma. Adding 2401/2400 to the blackjackisma leads to 7-limit miracle, and if for some reason that isn&apos;t good enough for you, no appreciable tuning accuracy is lost by tossing in 4375/4374 at any rate.</p></div><h3><a id=99514 href="#99514">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2011 11:24:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene wrote:</p><p>&gt; This means the corresponding comma, (15/4)^7/(8/5) = |-10 7 8 -7&gt;, is a &gt; comma of miracle which I think<br/>&gt; should be called the blackjackisma.</p><p>With all due respect, I would dare to call this the &quot;blackjackisma #1&quot;.<br/>The other very important factor, which certainly would also work as a &quot;blackjackisma&quot;, is |10,5,8,-13&gt; which is the same as (12/7)^13 * (5/12)^8.

The starting approximated triad in question is actually 5:7:12, which means that something like 3/2 doesn&apos;t come out as one of the approximants but rather as a product of some powers of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.</p><p>BTW: It&apos;s interesting that it&apos;s &quot;a^13 * b^8&quot; here and the amity comma has in my example was also &quot;a^13 * b^8&quot;, namely &quot;a=5/24, b=64/5&quot;. This means I could actually do the same pump in this version of miracle as I did in amity, in terms of generator patterns.

If I put the matter in terms of cubic lattice coordinates, then an otonal tetrad with root 81/80 is represented by [-1 4 3] and with root 1029/1024 by [3 4 1], so that one can be transformed to the other. In the same way, amity is represented by [5 -13 -8] and your comma by [-5 -8 13], so they are indeed transformable. Both amity and meantone comma pumps may be converted into miracle comma pumps. Unfortunately, if we put amity and meantone together we get the 7edo patent val, not too interesting as a way of transforming back out of miracle.</p></div><h3><a id=99520 href="#99520">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2011 3:29:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Aha!

I took the 12-tone &quot;Euler&apos;s monochord&quot; scale, which is essentially 5-limit JI, and replaced the 3/2 with one interval and the 5/4 with another. In one of them, I left the 3/2 alone and swapped 5/4 and 6/5. In others, I even replaced the 2/1 with something else -- when I wanted to get things like 3:5:7:9, for example.<br/>Maybe this 3D way of retuning is even more flexible than the 2D one, at least that&apos;s what common sense tells me that should be the case.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=99527 href="#99527">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2011 10:22:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve made use of 81/80~135/128~1029/1024 and 64/63~126/125.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you?
