Also voices at specified intervals (e.g. prime harmonics) to give interesting<br/>timbres.</p><p>Multiple undo / redo using Ctrl + z, Ctrl + y.</p><p>New buttons to record to Midi and Wave format as you play. (Thanks to Pat Bergano for suggestion that lead to idea of a<br/>button to record to Wave format).</p><p>Option to select patches and voice channel by input channel, and button to set everything up for re-tuning output of a<br/>score editor in any scale.</p><p>New options in the Search Scales drop list to enter desired number of words, and to search for all the words entered<br/>(instead of _any_ of them) - makes it easy to find a scale in SCALA archive from its definition, especially one using<br/>ratios.</p><p>As a last minute jeux d&apos;esprit, added a joystick theremin ;-) (click on the double quavers next to the Scale button,<br/>click on the +... below the thermin button to configure it)</p><p>Play buttons for main window to play seed, arpeggio, or scale before you listen to the fractal tune (thanks to Joseph<br/>Perhson for the idea).</p><p>Especial thanks to Manuel Op de Coul.</p><p>Download page:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_download.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_download.htm</a></p><p>or mirror site at<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
