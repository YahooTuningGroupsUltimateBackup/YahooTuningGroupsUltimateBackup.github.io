It hasn&apos;t proved<br/>very successful thus far!)<br/>I have tons of ground to learn to catch up in terms of technical aspects.<br/>But one of the advantages of being a newbie is the &quot;beginner&apos;s mind&quot;. I<br/>question everything, including the necessity of the concept of scale as we<br/>have been using it thus far. The music created under the diatonic (or<br/>chromatic) reference seems to me very much two dimensional (in its very<br/>raison d&apos;&#xFFFD;tre and expression), and that is so, among other factors, because<br/>of the linear thinking involved in scales. My question again is, do you<br/>create the tool and then figure out what it can do, or is the (conceptual)<br/>need what will compel you to develop the tool? Probably both, but my<br/>preference is the second option.</p></div>
