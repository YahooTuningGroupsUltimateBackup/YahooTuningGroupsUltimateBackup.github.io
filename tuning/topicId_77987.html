I also have a GeoCities homepage I started a decade ago, but it&apos;s sitting empty and inactive for now.</p><p>So far, I have two short microtonal compositions, both for 72-edo piano: &quot;Nocturne in G&quot; and &quot;Waterloo Rag&quot;. The latter is only about halfway done now, but I&apos;m hoping to have the complete version composed, sequenced and recorded by the end of the month. (&quot;The Runaway Piano&quot; is in 12-equal; it&apos;s something I wrote eleven years ago before I even knew what microtonal music was.)</p><p>Also, I have a cheap demonstration of how I write in 72-tone in HTML format, titled &quot;Composing in 72 equal temp...&quot;. It&apos;s also a work in progress, not meant to be anything academic, so there may be errors. I may turn it into a book-length manifesto.</p><p>By the way, I don&apos;t write everything for solo piano. I play fretless bass in a rock/metal/funk/fusion style, and I should try to record a few solos/demonstrations. ~D.</p></div>
