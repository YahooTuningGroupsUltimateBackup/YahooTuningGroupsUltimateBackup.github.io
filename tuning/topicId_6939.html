Cree Fischer.  The book was originally published in 1907.<br/>I have the Dover edition of 1975.  The author, Fischer, introduces<br/>the quote from Woolhouse as follows (p. 144 of the Dover edition):</p><p>    &quot;That the equal temperament is the only practical temperament,<br/>is confidently affirmed by Mr. W. S. B. Woolhouse, an eminent<br/>authority on musical mathematics, who says:-  &apos;It is very misleading<br/>to suppose that the necessity of temperament applies only to<br/>instruments which have fixed tones...  - rest of longish quote - &apos;</p><p>    Apart from the quotation in Fischer, I know nothing about<br/>W. S. B. Woolhouse excepting that he lived in the 19th century and<br/>that he is mentioned in Ellis&apos; translation of Helmholtz in connection<br/>with a 19 tone equal temperament.  In posting the quote to the tuning<br/>list, I assumed Mr. Fischer&apos;s reliability in conveying Mr. Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>point of view.  Is it possible that Mr. Woolhouse had done studies on<br/>19 tone equal temperament, but nevertheless emphatically advocated<br/>the more usual 12 equal temperament for practical musical<br/>performance?</p><p>    Dave Hill    La Mesa, CA</p></div><h3><a id=6966 href="#6966">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

However, his advocacy of<br/>19-tone equal tempermant, though it would not allow such practices, clearly<br/>had a very &quot;practical&quot; component, since the &quot;optimal&quot; meantone he derived<br/>(from 16th-18th century musical considerations) was essentially 50-tone<br/>equal temperament, and the only possible reason for suggesting 19 instead of<br/>50 would be a practical one of actually getting all those notes onto<br/>instruments.</p></div>
