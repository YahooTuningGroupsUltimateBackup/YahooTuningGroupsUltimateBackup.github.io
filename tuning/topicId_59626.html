Care to tell me<br/>something about overtone flutes - what they are, how they&apos;re made,<br/>how they&apos;re played, what they&apos;re good for?</p><p>I&apos;m not an instrument maker (except of the jam tin and spoon variety),<br/>so won&apos;t have a use for your &quot;interchangeable fretboard system for<br/>guitar&quot; :-)  The only microtonal music I make frequently is vocal; the<br/>rest is 12-edo on keyboards, simple flutes and guitars.  Oh yes, and on<br/>the PC!</p><p>Somehow I still haven&apos;t figured out how to get Scala to retune the MIDI<br/>keyboard for me in a way in which composition in anything _but_ 12-EDO<br/>becomes practical.  But I&apos;m going to have to do it soon, just so I can<br/>enjoy some of the many different delectable-seeming tunings these guys<br/>keep describing and inventing ...</p><p>Hope you enjoy your visit home!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>      Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>      Yahya [at] MelbPC [dot] Org [dot] Au<br/>      Melbourne PC User Group<br/>      Melbourne VIC Australia<br/>      Convener, Graphics Interest Group<br/>      Convener, Music Interest Group<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.7/70 - Release Date: 11/8/05</p></div><h3>Seth Austen &#x3C;seth@sethausten.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2005 10:32:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Aug 14, 2005, at 9:35 AM, Yahya Abdal-Aziz wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Care to tell me<br/>&gt; something about overtone flutes - what they are, how they&apos;re made,<br/>&gt; how they&apos;re played, what they&apos;re good for?</p><p>Hello Yahya,</p><p>Overtone flutes exist in various cultures, I&apos;m most familiar with the Scandinavian willow flute (salgflojt). I also have interest in the eastern European tilinka, but haven&apos;t made one of these yet. The willow flute was traditionally made of willow bark, but now usually made of PVC, the tilinka is made of copper tubing. There are no fingering holes on either type, you play it by overblowing and opening or closing the end, resulting in an octave plus of the natural overtone scale. It takes a lot of practice to get accurate, especially in its higher register.</p><p>I bought the ones I have from Lark in the Morning, &lt;<a href="http://www.larkinthemorning.com/product.asp_Q_pn_E_FLU038_A_Overtone+Flutes_E_">http://www.larkinthemorning.com/product.asp_Q_pn_E_FLU038_A_Overtone+Flutes_E_</a>&gt;, these are Scandinavian style side blown flutes, made of PVC with a wooden fipple, available in two keys, D and F.</p><p>&gt; The only microtonal music I make frequently is vocal; the<br/>&gt; rest is 12-edo on keyboards, simple flutes and guitars.  Oh yes, and on<br/>&gt; the PC!</p><p>I use a Mac.</p><p>Good to meet you!</p><p>Seth</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>Seth Austen<br/><a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a></p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2005 10:22:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Seth Austen wrote:<br/>&gt; On Aug 14, 2005, at 9:35 AM, Yahya Abdal-Aziz wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Care to tell me<br/>&gt; &gt; something about overtone flutes - what they are, how they&apos;re made,<br/>&gt; &gt; how they&apos;re played, what they&apos;re good for?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Yahya,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Overtone flutes exist in various cultures, I&apos;m most familiar with the<br/>&gt; Scandinavian willow flute (salgflojt).
