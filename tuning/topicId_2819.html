You can play over all the changes and itsounds<br/>&gt;OK?</p><p>Depends what changes. Many 20th century composers, classical, jazz, and<br/>prog-rock, have long sections entirely in this scales. With four major<br/>triads, four minor triads, and lots of more dissonant harmonies, it&apos;s quite<br/>rich.

Real bebop music seldom<br/>stays in one &quot;scale&quot; for very long; all twelve tones will generally be found<br/>in a long enough sample.</p></div><h3><a id=2833 href="#2833">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/1999 3:48:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul H.

The scale can be derived by playing<br/>a melodic minor (1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 8) scale on the b5 of the 1 chord, but<br/>starting the scale on the 1 of the V chord.   Thinking of it this way is<br/>usefull for guitar players.  This scale sounds bitchin over any altered<br/>dominant chord.  In the dominant chord the 5th or 9th can be implied.</p><p>You can&apos;t really play it over &quot;all the changes&quot;  It is considered an altered<br/>dominant scale with flat or sharp 9th and or 5th on the V7 chord.  It would<br/>not sound good on the I chord.  Each of the various scale tones can resolve<br/>to the various elements of I chord:</p><p>b9 resolves to 5<br/>#9 resolves to #7<br/>b5 resolves to 1 or 9 (although it is &quot;square&quot; resolve on the 1 of the 1<br/>chord.  much better to land on a &quot;pretty&quot; note like the ninth)<br/>#5 resolves to 3 or 9</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is it like the blues scale? You can play over all the changes and itsounds<br/>&gt;OK? With that one scale one can play Giant Steps?</p><p>No, see above.  Giant Steps modulates through a cycle of II V I progressions<br/>in thirds, not fifths as in traditional harmony.</p><p>&gt;And why do they call it the bebop scale anyway?</p><p>I would say that Bird and Diz invented it.  They were looking for new sounds<br/>and the 5th and 9th were the likely targets.  The scale partly characterized<br/>the sound of the new Jazz of the mid forties.</p><p>I wonder how these progressions would play out in JI.
