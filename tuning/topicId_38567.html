It has always amused me that<br/>people will at least, put up with crickets, cicadas, and other such nature<br/>noises and often, even relish them. Yet when we put nontriadic sounds in<br/>our music that are much less complex, most of our audience will run back to<br/>the woods. I have my own guesses as to why people prefer bumblebees to<br/>Bartok, but I know I caught the similarities early on when I encountered<br/>especially electronic pieces of the Stockhausen/Xenakis variety.<br/> At 04:50 PM 7/10/02 +0100, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As for EDO / ET scales - including 72 - these are seen to be source material<br/>&gt;for the unusual, non 12 or whatever, intervals.
