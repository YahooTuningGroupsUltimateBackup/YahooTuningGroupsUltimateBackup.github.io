Who?</p><p>&gt; Johnny, I bid you no ill will.  You played marvelously<br/>&gt; on many occasions... most memorable for me was the<br/>&gt; (non-quartertone) Wyschnegradsky piece at the 2000<br/>&gt; AFMM concert.  I told you afterwards how well I thought<br/>&gt; it came off.</p><p>Carl, really, we are fine as people.  It&apos;s about the facts.  For example, the<br/>Wyschnegradsky piece DID have plenty of quartertones and sixthtones (which of<br/>course included notated thirdtones) throughout.  Only the piano had no<br/>quartertones.  Could it be you didn&apos;t notice them because they were played so<br/>naturally?</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t heard your ensemble do the things you claim<br/>&gt; it does.  Now you know.  Can you live with this?<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, and now you can temper your wilder assumptions until you have.  It&apos;s the<br/>same thing as researching a book.</p><p>&gt; You thought my piece didn&apos;t belong in your program, at<br/>&gt; best.  Now I know.  I can live with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>And not because it was a BAD piece.  It was a fine short composition, only it<br/>was completely out of tune.  And you were its director, regardless of what<br/>fate put in front of you.  You were the one who had the info to pull it as it<br/>was not ready.  That is a level of professionalism that is obviously new to<br/>you.</p><p>What is most important for me to express to you is that we all have different<br/>things running around in our noodles and should be extra careful in making<br/>repeated public criticisms based entirely on assumptions.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2002 11:14:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;The 45-minutes of a guy making metal-scraping noises,<br/>&gt;&gt;however, is stuck in all our minds for eternity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No idea what you mean.

This<br/>was at the end of the 2000 concert, at the Quaker (IIRC) school.<br/>After you said you were worried about programming a 12-tone work,<br/>but thought it was so great a work, and all music is microtonal<br/>anyway, that you included it.  I agreed.  Maybe you were just<br/>referring to the piano.</p><p>&gt;And you were its director, regardless of what fate put in front of you.<br/>&gt;You were the one who had the info to pull it as it was not ready.

It was my first public performance.<br/>Since I have given two more with much better (5-limit) results.</p><p>I stand by my remarks, which may be incorrect but are based on easily<br/>a books-worth of research.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/21/2007 1:22:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Please, you have been asked before, please, could you please give the name<br/>of the person you are quoting.
