On average across the entire two collections, however, Bach does seem to emphasize the &apos;bad&apos; major thirds in the minor-key preludes even more than the &apos;good&apos; ones. Some of Brad Lehman&apos;s examples actually support this claim. The B-flat-minor prelude from Book 2 also contains many prominent &apos;poorly tuned&apos; thirds, as does the F-sharp-minor from Book 2. The E-flat-minor prelude from Book I uses even more! As for examples where Bach avoids the &apos;good&apos; major thirds in minor-key preludes, refer to the A- and E-minor in Book 2, and the D- and B-minor in Book 1.</p><p>Brad Lehman&apos;s references to major-key examples also seem to support (at least in part) Barnes&apos;s claim that Bach emphasizes the &apos;good&apos; major thirds in these keys: the F-major of Book 2 contains many prominent &apos;good&apos; major thirds. And while the B-major and A-flat major might contain more &apos;bad&apos; major thirds than some of the other preludes in similar keys, they certainly do not emphasize these thirds as strongly as other preludes do the &apos;good&apos; major thirds.</p><p>The problem with cherry-picking examples like this is that we can use them to support any claim about the collection. A broad, statistical study, such as Barnes&apos;s, attempts to balance out the effects of individual preludes, hopefully revealing any underlying trends.</p><p>&gt; A huge problem with Barnes&apos;s analysis, in his article, is that he omits<br/>&gt; 10ths and 17ths from his data set.  He also omits all the fugues!  The<br/>&gt; only pieces that carry much weight in his experiment are the preludes<br/>&gt; that happen to have close/dense texture.</p><p>I fully agree. At best, Barnes&apos;s analysis is incomplete. At worst, it could be totally irrelevant. But I won&apos;t be convinced that it deserves the &quot;ash can&quot; until we make a valid comparison of the major to minor keys, incorporate the fugues, and take intervals other than major thirds into account.</p><p>&gt;  Pieces like the Ab major of<br/>&gt; book 2 hardly get to come to the table, in this business of assessing<br/>&gt; major 3rds and any alleged &quot;avoidance&quot; of discord therein.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, Barnes&apos;s analysis of this particular prelude is questionable. I hear the &apos;poor&apos; thirds as being very prominent, but Barnes chose to give them very little weight. This is one of the reasons why I intend to redo an analysis of the major-key works, using my own criteria for assigning prominence.</p><p>&gt; The way to test all this is to play the actual music on a<br/>&gt; medium-to-bright-toned harpsichord, not just to stare at scores and<br/>&gt; spreadsheets and articles.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Again, I couldn&apos;t agree more. But unfortunately some of us don&apos;t have the time (or the facility at the keyboard) to play the entire set of 48, retune, play again to compare, then repeat the entire process for each temperament we wish to evaluate against the WTC. Analysis along the lines of Barnes&apos;s allows a broad and inclusive--and at the same time very fast and easy--evaluation of a temperament against the 48. Such an evaluation remains, however, woefully superficial.</p><p>I am much more interested by Bach&apos;s apparent emphasis of pure versus impure intervals in major versus minor keys than I am in using the analysis as a tool to evaluate temperaments. If Bach really does prefer purer major thirds in major keys, and less pure major thirds in minor keys, the analysis could give us a glimpse of how he conceived the sonic worlds of major and minor. A concordant major versus a discordant minor is compelling, given the affects we generally assign to these modalities.</p><p>-Steven Cannon</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2009 7:22:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Another important piece for tuning problems, but overlooked by Barnes&apos;s analysis (because of its two-voice texture, more than an octave apart: i.e. scarcely any major 3rds), is the F# major prelude of book 1.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2009 4:18:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another important piece for tuning problems, but overlooked by<br/>&gt; Barnes&apos;s analysis (because of its two-voice texture, more than an<br/>&gt; octave apart: i.e. scarcely any major 3rds), is the F# major prelude &gt; of book 1.</p><p>My longer remarks about that, from January:<br/><a href="http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0901&L=HPSCHD-L&P=R7900&D=1&H=0&I=-3&O=D&T=0">http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0901&L=HPSCHD-L&P=R7900&D=1&H=0&I=-3&O=D&T=0</a></p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Claudio Di Veroli &#x3C;dvc@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2009 4:25:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brad wrote:<br/>Barnes&apos;s analysis ...

But your counter-evidence here is anecdotal--almost like the global-warming denier who says the climate can&apos;t be getting warmer, since they just had a snowstorm in May. Sorry for that insulting comparison--but until you count up the major thirds across all works in a systematic way (I know, this doesn&apos;t feel very musicianly), it&apos;s difficult to say.</p><p>Before seeing Barnes&apos;s (and Cannon&apos;s) results, I would never have believed that the distribution of a particular interval in the WTC would exhibit any meaningful pattern. But it&apos;s a fact that major thirds enjoy a distribution in the major-key preludes that correlates very well with their expected closeness to just, in several plausible well-temperaments. I don&apos;t think you can reliably deduce a particular temperament from it; the data is not fine-grained enough. But you can&apos;t *dismiss* the data just because it was obtained via spreadsheet instead of via musical experience. The fact the statistics are similar in WTC I and WTC II, and the close fit of the inverse curve when the minor-key pieces are considered, means there is some effect here that is worth an attempt at explanation.</p><p>I always thought that Barnes left out the fugues because the contrapuntal requirements there will lead to certain forced compositional choices, which could conceivably override the acoustic factors in some contexts. In the Preludes Bach is freer, and so the deviations from flat distribution are more meaningful. (I can&apos;t remember if this is what Barnes himself said, or if this is my own gloss.)</p><p>I also find plausible the notion that the perception of purity/impurity in M 3rds is different from that of 10ths. And anyway, the fact that there actually *is* a pattern in the distribution of 3rds--which is highly unlikely if attributed to random deviations--still deserves explanation, even if you&apos;d prefer to see the data with tenths included.</p><p>There is another criticism, to the effect that a few pieces were first composed in other keys and transposed to new keys to fill gaps in the WTC. To this I&apos;d say that Bach had a choice about which keys he transposed those previously-composed works into--and presumably he chose keys that worked well to his ear.</p><p>To the criticism that Barnes disregarded the minor-key music: Steven&apos;s study suggests it is sensible to separate out the minor-key works because they operate on different aesthetic principles.</p><p>I agree with you that it would seem the pieces with thick texture will overwhelm the experiment--that they have more M3rds just because they have more close spacings. But still, Bach had a choice about which keys to compose thick preludes in! Presumably they sounded better to him in the keys he wrote them in, than in other keys. Again, I wouldn&apos;t feel comfortable actually deducing a temperament from all of that--but *something* persists from all this data, and that something is not as meaningless as you believe it is.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jon Wild</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>4/5/2009 7:12:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>With concerts up on the radar, it has not been possible to do much with the<br/>List.
