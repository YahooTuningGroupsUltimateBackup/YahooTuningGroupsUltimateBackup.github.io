If Wilson can<br/>&gt;&gt; manage to convey his ideas with such simple language I can&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; understand why the rest of you can&apos;t!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think Joe Monzo and others who have told me so will agree<br/>&gt; that Erv Wilson is one of the most unforgiving theorists ever<br/>&gt; to delve into microtonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His writing is so dense, and his thought process so concealed,<br/>&gt; that one could easily write a book trying to explain a single<br/>&gt; Wilson article to a beginner. While academic journal articles<br/>&gt; tend to proceed logically, point by point, Wilson&apos;s style is<br/>&gt; unbelievably abstruse. What I love about him is that he often<br/>&gt; has more to say in a single diagram than ten articles can say<br/>&gt; in a hundred pages of text!</p><p>I think Paul&apos;s description of Wilson&apos;s work is most apt.<br/>Probably the main reason for the abstruseness of his text<br/>is his ability to cram so much information into his diagrams.</p><p>I&apos;ve been a &apos;map geek&apos; for quite a long time, and can pass<br/>hours reading a single map in the same way &apos;regular&apos; people<br/>read a book.  I find that good maps are simply *packed* with<br/>information.  The diagrams drawn by Wilson, myself, and others,<br/>are similar to maps in this respect.</p><p>The secret that mathematicians know, and which remains generally<br/>obscure to the rest of us, is that *anything* can be described<br/>by mathematics.</p><p>The power of visualizing things on a computer screen (and even<br/>more so, in virtual reality) is what finally brought this idea<br/>home to me.  Musical tuning is merely one &apos;thing&apos; that can be<br/>accurately described and manipulated thru the employment of<br/>mathematics.</p><p>I recognize Wilson&apos;s work as being more similar to my own than<br/>anything else I&apos;ve encountered in my years of tuning research<br/>(which is why I pay homage to him in my signature), and yet<br/>it still takes me many readings of his articles to understand<br/>what he&apos;s saying in his text, whereas the diagrams &apos;speak&apos; to<br/>me immediately.</p><p>My only regret in connection with Wilson&apos;s work is that my<br/>first encounter with it came so late in my own development.<br/>Had I been aware of his articles when I first got interested<br/>in tuning, they would have saved me *years* of hard thinking,<br/>frustration, and mental anguish.  I think it&apos;s remarkable that<br/>the lattice diagrams I&apos;ve developed independently bear such<br/>a strong resemblance to some of the diagrams Wilson and Chalmers<br/>created back in the 1960s.</p><p>As for the mathematical excursuses and excursions in this forum,<br/>please keep them coming.  My mathematical education only goes<br/>up to algebra (stopping short of trig and calculus), and I don&apos;t<br/>remember much of that, but in tandem with the lattice diagrams<br/>which I love so much, there&apos;s no better tool for grappling with<br/>tuning issues and theories.</p><p>As Dave Keenan and I mentioned several months back, and Johnny<br/>Reinhard brought up again recently, theoretical manifestos have<br/>their own kind of beauty, not unrelated to a musical score itself.<br/>The enjoyment of reading both theoretical treatises and scores<br/>is different from the purely aural sensation of listening to<br/>the music.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
