As I said before, I&apos;ve been reposting<br/>stuff from your forum over here for some time now when relevant.</p><p>Can you recommend some hardware to interface with this? So far,<br/>existing microtonal MIDI controllers are either prohibitively<br/>expensive, or they&apos;re setup in a format that I think is less than<br/>ideal (like the Wicki layout on the AXiS-49). This may just be my<br/>preference, because lots of people here seem to like the AXiS, but I&apos;d<br/>prefer a Bosanquet layout... can&apos;t find any under a few thousand.</p><p>Is there some obvious solution that I&apos;m missing? Some kind of speak<br/>and spell hexagonal button panel that can be adapted with an Arduino<br/>for use with your software. I see that the MIDI integrator allows for<br/>the use of the actual computer keyboard in controlling the sound<br/>output, but as you know, some keyboards only let you push a couple of<br/>buttons at a time before they crap out...</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sat, Apr 9, 2011 at 8:46 PM, musicscienceguy &lt;krushton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike just told me that you have &quot;watching your antics very closely&quot; as you of this group are looking for an easy way to create microtonal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I have been writing software to make the whole midi experience both cheaper and more productive, a concept I now call &quot;midi integration&quot; - integrating the PC better with midi via a few simple improvements in the midi processing system.<br/>&gt; While I don&apos;t have time to pursue MT myself right now (I understand some of the concepts), I did definitely write my software, packaged as &quot;Midi Integrator&quot; with MT extensions in mind.<br/>&gt; The software, manual and Max/MSP source code is all here: <a href="http://www.altkeyboards.com/file-cabinet">http://www.altkeyboards.com/file-cabinet</a> and an improving online description is here: <a href="http://www.altkeyboards.com/integrator">http://www.altkeyboards.com/integrator</a>&nbsp; It runs when unzipped, on both Win/Mac platforms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be simple to make Integrator microtonal.
