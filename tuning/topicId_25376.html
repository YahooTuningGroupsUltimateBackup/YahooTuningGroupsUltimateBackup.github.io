My interpretations,<br/>however accurate or otherwise, thus may not necessarily reflect his<br/>current views as expressed in the new statement.]</p><p>As one comprehensive introduction to physics points out: &quot;Physicists<br/>like to find areas that seem to have nothing to do with each other and<br/>to show that they are related if you look at them closely enough.&quot;[1]</p><p>Remarkably, Paul Erlich&apos;s famous article on &quot;Tuning, Tonality, and<br/>Twenty-Two-Tone Temperament&quot;[2] suggests such a connection between the<br/>favorite cadences of two very different eras of Western European<br/>music: the 14th and 18th centuries.</p><p>Many listeners would likely agree that the cadences of these eras have<br/>different sounds. First, here&apos;s a favorite final cadence from the 14th<br/>century, the era of Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini, in a<br/>standard Pythagorean intonation:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei001.mid</a></p><p>Compare this with a typical 18th-19th century final cadence, here<br/>tuned in Werckmeister&apos;s Temperament 3, one likely choice in the era of<br/>Johann Sebastian Bach:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/wm3i001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/wm3i001.mid</a></p><p>Despite the differences in style, Erlich&apos;s approach suggests that both<br/>cadences use &quot;signposts&quot; or &quot;melodic guidance&quot; to reinforce the<br/>definition of a &quot;strong&quot; vertical center.[3]</p><p>Following and somewhat enlarging upon Erlich&apos;s approach, these<br/>signposts may tend to take on different shapes depending on at least<br/>two variables: the basic type of scale structure, and the type<br/>of saturated vertical sonority, favored in a given era or style.</p><p>Erlich&apos;s paper, published in 1998, mentions medieval European music,<br/>but looks more closely at some other styles. However, when his<br/>concepts are applied to the complex polyphony of the 13th and 14th<br/>centuries, they seem actually to predict the &quot;strongest&quot; and most<br/>popular cadences especially in vogue during the latter portion of this<br/>era.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>1. Closest approach and &quot;position finding&quot;<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>Looking at a three-voice example of a 14th-century cadence from a<br/>style-specific point of view, it&apos;s easy enough to explain this<br/>progression, here shown in a notation with C4 as middle C:</p><p>          C#4   D4<br/>          G#3   A3<br/>          E3    D3</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei003.mid</a></p><p>We might first note that the destination sonority or goal of the<br/>cadence, D3-A3-D4, is the characteristic &quot;perfect&quot; or saturated<br/>sonority of the era, with outer 2:1 octave (here D3-D4), lower 3:2<br/>fifth (here D3-A3), and upper 4:3 fourth (here A3-D4). Johannes de<br/>Grocheio (c. 1300) refers to this complete sonority as manifesting<br/>_trina harmoniae perfectio_, &quot;the threefold perfection of harmony,&quot;<br/>suggesting the modern English name &quot;trine.&quot;[4]</p><p>An anonymous treatise of the same epoch, recently ascribed to the<br/>great theorist Jacobus of Liege, states that the outer octave of this<br/>sonority is best arranged to follow the order of numbers which Nature<br/>has &quot;serially&quot; (_seriatim_) disposed, &quot;2-3-4.&quot; In this natural series,<br/>the 2:3 fifth is placed below the 3:4 fourth.[5]</p><p>Focusing on the unstable sonority E3-G#3-C#4 leading to this ideally<br/>concordant resolution, we see that it has two unstable Gothic<br/>intervals: the major third E3-G#4, and the major sixxth E3-C#4. In the<br/>resolution, the major third expands to a fifth (M3-5) and the major<br/>sixth to an octave (M6-8), with these resolutions mutually reinforcing<br/>each other.</p><p>More generally, the 14th century favors &quot;closest approach&quot;<br/>progressions in which an unstable interval resolves to a stable one<br/>with one voice moving by a whole-tone and the other by a diatonic<br/>semitone. This preference favors two varieties of our (M6-8 + M3-5)<br/>cadence, featuring either ascending or descending semitonal motions:</p><p>          C#4   D4<br/>          G#3   A3<br/>          E3    D3</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei003.mid</a></p><p>          D4    E4<br/>          A3    B3<br/>          F3    E3</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3er004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3er004.mid</a></p><p>Typically the form with ascending semitonal motion is preferred as a<br/>final cadence,, while the form with descending semitones is preferred<br/>for internal cadences.</p><p>While these cadences admirably epitomize the specific patterns of a<br/>Gothic style, they also fit a more general guideline proposed by<br/>Erlich, the principle of &quot;melodic guidance&quot;[6]:</p><p>            &quot;The rarest step sizes are only found adjacent<br/>             to notes of the tonic chord, acting as &apos;signposts&apos;<br/>             if not necessarily leading tones _per se_.&quot;</p><p>In Gothic music, the relevant &quot;step sizes&quot; are those of a diatonic<br/>scale, often supplemented in the 14th century, as in later eras, by<br/>additional inflected notes. Here, as typically in diatonic music, the<br/>&quot;rarest&quot; sizes are the diatonic semitones, at 256:243 (~90.22 cents)<br/>in Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Thus Erlich&apos;s guideline calls for these semitones of a seven-note<br/>diatonic set to be located adjacent to the notes of our &quot;tonic chord&quot;<br/>or cadential center, here the complete Gothic trine D3-A3-D4 or<br/>E3-B3-E4. Both cadences indeed satisfy this condition, and represent<br/>the _only_ available patterns using regular diatonic intervals and<br/>melodic steps for satisfying it:</p><p>      C#4  D4               D4  E4<br/>      G#3  A3               A3  B3<br/>      E3   D3               F3  E3</p><p>(D-G#: G#-A, C#-D)     (F-B: F-E, C-B)</p><p>The notes used in each progression fit within a seven-note diatonic<br/>set: D-G# in the first example, and F-B in the second. We can confirm<br/>that in the first example, the two diatonic semitones G#3-A3 and<br/>C#4-D4, are both adjacent to the resolving trine D3-A3-D4. In the<br/>second example, the semitones F3-E3 and C4-B3 -- only the first in<br/>this instance actually used as a cadential step -- are likewise<br/>adjacent to the trine E3-B3-E4.</p><p>In 14th-century terms, these progressions follow the rule of &quot;closest<br/>approach&quot; that thirds expanding to fifths or sixths to octave should<br/>be major. In Erlich&apos;s 20th-21st century terms, they also follow the<br/>more general rule that for the strongest definition of a vertical<br/>center, the &quot;rarest steps&quot; of a scale should be adjacent to the notes<br/>of this stable center.</p><p>From either perspective, the standard Pythagorean tuning of the era<br/>enhances relevant musical contrasts. Fifths and fourths are pure,<br/>while unstable major thirds and sixths have rather complex ratios of<br/>81:64 (~407.82 cents) and 27:16 (~905.87 cents), thus adding to the<br/>sensen of vertical tension and excitement, and resolving it in a most<br/>satisfying way.</p><p>At the same time, the contrast between generous whole-tones at 9:8<br/>(~203.91 cents) and the narrow 90-cent semitones may make the role of<br/>the latter as Erlich&apos;s melodic &quot;signposts&quot; yet more compelling.</p><p>As our cadence on D3-A3-D4 illustrates, accidental inflections (here<br/>G# and C#) are sometimes required to follow the rule of &quot;closest<br/>approach,&quot; or of Erlich&apos;s &quot;melodic guidance.&quot; In Section 3, we<br/>consider this facet of 14th-century accidentalism in more detail.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Erlich&apos;s &quot;melodic signposts&quot;: from trine to triad<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Curiously, our 18th-century cadence given at the beginning of this<br/>article also follows Erlich&apos;s guidance, the main difference being a<br/>different standard of saturated stability, here the complete triad at<br/>4:5:6 (outer 2:3 fifth, lower 4:5 major third, upper 5:6 minor third):</p><p>                 F5  E5<br/>                 B4  C5<br/>                 G4  G4<br/>                 D4  C4<br/>                 G3  C3</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/wm3i001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/wm3i001.mid</a></p><p>This cadence, in approaching the triadic center C3-C4-G4-C5-E5, also<br/>features the resolution of an unstable interval by stepwise contrary<br/>motion: the diminished fifth B4-F5 contracts to the prime concord of<br/>the major third C5-E5. Additionally, the unstable minor seventh G3-F5<br/>further accentuates the level of tension.</p><p>As in our 14th-century trinic cadences, so in this 18th-century<br/>triadic cadence, the progression fits within a seven-note diatonic set<br/>in which both diatonic semitones are adjacent to the vertical center.<br/>Here the set is F-B, with the semitones B-C and F-E both adjacent to<br/>notes of the triad C3-E3-G3.</p><p>Werckmeister&apos;s well-temperament used in the MIDI file for this<br/>example, while intended in good part to permit a closed tuning in only<br/>12 notes on a fixed-pitch instrument, does so while fitting the<br/>intonational parameters of this kind of style: major and minor thirds<br/>in the most common transpositions are rather close to the simplest<br/>ratios of 5:4 (~386.31 cents) and 6:5 (~315.64 cents).</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Closest approach and accidentalism: originizing and ultimatizing<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While both 14th-century and 18th-century cadences follow the paradigm<br/>of Erlich&apos;s &quot;melodic guidance,&quot; the former do so in a way involving an<br/>expressive element giving the music a special suppleness and flavor:<br/>fluid accidentalism.</p><p>Using only the seven notes of a diatonic scale without accidentals, we<br/>can build closest approach cadences of the (M6-8 + M3-5) variety on<br/>only two degrees: F or E:</p><p>         E4   F4                              D4   E4<br/>         B3   C4                              A3   B3<br/>         G3   F3                              F3   E3</p><p>F - C - G - D - A - E - B             F - C - G - D - A - E - B</p><p>Cadence on F: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3ei004.mid</a>&gt;<br/>Cadence on E: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3er004.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3er004.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>From a closest approach perspective, the trines F3-C4-F4 and E3-B3-E4<br/>are the only ones in which this diatonic set provides a _major_ third<br/>which can expand by stepwise motion to the fifth of the trine (G3-B3<br/>to F3-C4; F3-A3 to E3-B3).[7]</p><p>From Erlich&apos;s perspective of &quot;melodic guidance,&quot; similarly, only the<br/>trines F3-C4-F4 or E3-B3-E4 satisfy in this diatonic set the property<br/>of having both semitone steps (B-C, E-F) adjacent to their notes.</p><p>Dr. Marshall Tuttle, a music theorist and Wagner scholar, has observed<br/>that in the first type of cadence (here on F3-C4-F4), the fifth of the<br/>resolving trine is the _first_ or _lowest_ fifth of the chain making<br/>up the diatonic set, here F-C-G-D-A-E-B.[8]</p><p>Taking a cue from this observation of Dr. Tuttle, we may note that the<br/>second type of cadence (here on E3-B3-E4) involves a trine whose fifth<br/>is the _last_ or _highest_ of the chain (here again F-C-G-D-A-E-B).</p><p>From this 21st-century viewpoint, we might say that an (M6-8 + M3-5)<br/>cadence with ascending semitonal motion &quot;originizes&quot; a trine such as<br/>F3-C4-F4, placing its fifth at the origin of a diatonic chain.</p><p>A similar cadence with descending semitonal motion &quot;ultimatizes&quot; a<br/>trine such as E3-B3-E4, placing its fifth at the &quot;ultimate&quot; position<br/>in such a chain.</p><p>The desire to make closest approach cadences on various steps of an<br/>octave species or mode in the course of a piece -- in our current<br/>terms, to originize or ultimatize various trines -- provides a<br/>powerful motivation for 14th-century accidentalism.</p><p>Erlich&apos;s 1998 paper seems to focus on a kind of model where cadences<br/>are largely derived from the usual tones of a diatonic or other<br/>melodic set (e.g. his decatonic scale based on stable vertical tetrads<br/>of 4:5:6:7).</p><p>In contrast, the 14th-century approach is to use a variety of octave<br/>species with accidental inflections available as needed or desired to<br/>achieve closest approach cadences, as in the final cadence of<br/>E3-G#3-C#4 to D3-A3-D4 in an octave species or mode of D-D.</p><p>Not only the &quot;native&quot; steps of an octave species or mode, but the<br/>routine inflections called for at cadential progressions, may<br/>contribute to its characteristic qualities. Consider, for example,<br/>this approach to the center D3-A3-D4 as realized in 22-tone equal<br/>temperament (22-tET), an appropriate choice given Erlich&apos;s able<br/>advocacy of this tuning through practice as well as theory:</p><p>       F4  E4  D4  C#4  D4<br/>       C4  B3  A3  G#3  A3<br/>       A3  G3  F3  E3   D3</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei001.mid</a></p><p>The melodic diminished fourths F4-C#4 and C4-G#3 outlined by this type<br/>of descending cadential figure take on a special quality in 22-tET,<br/>where they have a size of about 327.27 cents, actually a kind of large<br/>minor third!</p><p>--------------------------------------------<br/>4. Closest approach and the diagonal tritone<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>One obvious difference between our favorite 14th-century cadences and<br/>the most popular 18th-century form is that only the latter involves<br/>the vertical interval of the tritone (augmented fourth) or diminished<br/>fifth (e.g. F3-B3 or B3-F4), which Erlich terms a &quot;characteristic<br/>dissonance&quot; involving the same number of scale steps as a stable<br/>concord, here the usual fourth or fifth (e.g. G3-C3 or C4-G4).</p><p>In a seven-note diatonic set, such intervals uniquely involve the two<br/>notes at the extremes of the chain of fifths, e.g. F-B or B-F in the<br/>set F-C-G-D-A-E-B.</p><p>In vertical terms, we might say that the defining unstable interval of<br/>our trinic (M6-8 + M3-5) cadences is the major third, available within<br/>the same diatonic set at two locations where it can expand by stepwise<br/>contrary motion to a stable fifth included in the same set, e.g. F-A<br/>or G-B in the set F-C-G-D-A-E-B.</p><p>At some level, possibly, the availability of _two_ such intervals, one<br/>expanding to the first fifth of the chain (G3-B3 to F3-C4) and the<br/>other to the last fifth (F3-A3 to E3-B3), may tie in with the<br/>characteristic polarities between these two types of resolutions in<br/>14th-century cadences and musical forms.</p><p>Does the unique interval of the tritone play any role in these same<br/>cadences? One reason it may figure more prominently in 18th-century<br/>triadic progressions is that there, with thirds and sixths as stable<br/>intervals, it can resolve to such intervals by stepwise contrary<br/>motion (e.g. d5-M3 in our example using a Werckmeister tuning).</p><p>However, we find that the tritone does also occur in our 14th-century<br/>cadences as a kind of &quot;diagonal&quot; interval:</p><p>    C#4   D4                  D4    E4</p><p>    G#3   A3                  A3    B3<br/>       \                           /<br/>         \                       /<br/>    E3    D3                  F3    E3</p><p>D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#            F-C-G-D-A-E-B</p><p>In the first progression, we have a diagonal tritone between G#3 in<br/>the unstable sonority and D3 in the resolution; similarly, in the<br/>second, we have the tritone relation F3-B3.</p><p>One might say that this tritone marks the &quot;metes and bounds&quot; of a<br/>diatonic set including all the notes involved in the progression:<br/>here D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G# or F-C-G-D-A-E-B.</p><p>It should be noted that this &quot;local cadential set&quot; is not necessarily<br/>that of the prevailing octave species or mode, with certain degrees<br/>often taking on a fluid quality.</p><p>In the octave species of D-D, the medieval Dorian mode, for example,<br/>we can expect frequently to encounter both forms of G/G# and C/C#; the<br/>fluidity of the degree B/Bb (or German H/B) in the traditional<br/>medieval gamut may provide a precedent for this flexibility, along<br/>with the 13th-century use of various accidentals (Eb, F#, C#).</p><p>Thus while Erlich&apos;s &quot;melodic guidance&quot; points to a common feature of<br/>14th-century and 18th-century cadences, this principle may promote<br/>either the restriction of the range of modes largely to those<br/>permitting such cadences with &quot;native&quot; notes; or the use of a variety<br/>of modes with fluid accidental inflections as required or desired to<br/>achieve these cadences.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>5. Some historical implications<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>While many 20th-century histories of Western European composition have<br/>tended to assume a gradual process of evolution, or even &quot;progress,&quot;<br/>toward the tonal system of the 18th-19th centuries, medievalists such<br/>as Richard Crocker have asserted that 14th-century music has its own<br/>&quot;tonal plans&quot; and schemes of long-range organization based on a<br/>compelling cadential logic.</p><p>Following the general kind of analysis which Erlich&apos;s paper suggests,<br/>we can indeed conclude that both 14th-century and 18th-century<br/>cadences represent especially efficient and compelling progressions<br/>for defining a stable vertical center, with the 2:3:4 trine or 4:5:6<br/>triad respectively defining such a saturated center.</p><p>Both types of cadences involve Erlich&apos;s &quot;melodic guidance,&quot; with both<br/>semitones of a diatonic set adjacent to notes of the resolving<br/>sonority.</p><p>Additionally, both types involve the element of unstable intervals<br/>resolving to stable ones by stepwise contrary motion -- in Erlich&apos;s<br/>terms, one might speak of such intervals also as &quot;adjacent&quot; to those<br/>of the resolving sonority -- thus M3-5 and M6-8 in a trinic context,<br/>or d5-M3 in a triadic context.</p><p>Such comparisons, of course, do not necessarily &quot;explain&quot; the<br/>stylistic choices of a specific era or genre, but can point to some<br/>organizational themes which may manifest themselves in music of<br/>various eras and styles.</p><p>Also, while Erlich&apos;s paradigm predicts that certain types of<br/>progressions such as those favored in the 14th and 18th centuries may<br/>be especially &quot;strong&quot; in defining a vertical center, musicians are<br/>free to use or even at times to prefer more &quot;gentle&quot; or &quot;pluralistic&quot;<br/>formulae. One charm of 13th-century music, for example, is its<br/>frequent use of cadences with all voices moving by whole-tones, as in<br/>this example:</p><p>        G3  A3<br/>        E3  D3<br/>        C3  D3</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/py3o001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/py3o001.mid</a></p><p>Since Erlich&apos;s 1998 paper does not itself address a specific analysis<br/>of complex 13th-14th century Western European polyphony, I emphasize<br/>that while my indebtedness to him is obvious, the responsibility for<br/>any (mis)interpretations is of course mine.</p><p>Specifically, I have approached Gothic polyphony as a trinic/diatonic<br/>type of style where the fluid cadential inflections of the 14th<br/>century may define a &quot;local&quot; seven-note diatonic set not necessarily<br/>identical to that of an overall &quot;native&quot; octave species or mode.</p><p>Whether or how Erlich&apos;s original formulations might fit such a<br/>scenario may remain an open question, with his response much invited.</p><p>At the least, however, the concept of &quot;melodic guidance&quot; does neatly<br/>connect the very different cadential styles of the 14th and 18th<br/>centuries, suggesting that one can make interesting comparisons while<br/>recognizing the unique integrity and beauty of each era.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

Similarly, without positing the harmonic<br/>series, Zarlino takes the _senario_ 1-2-3-4-5-6 as stating the ideal<br/>vertical arrangement of consonant intervals: first the 1:2 octave,<br/>next the 2:3 fifth and 3:4 fourth, and then the 4:5 major third and<br/>5:6 minor third (e.g. C2-C3-G3-C4-E4-G4).</p><p>6. See Erlich, n. 2 above, pp. 19-20 and n. 24. Following an approach<br/>based in part on the writings of Joseph Yasser and Harry Partch,<br/>Erlich applies this and other elements of his paradigm to pentatonic<br/>music in the 3-odd-limit (most complex stable intervals 3:2 and 4:3);<br/>diatonic music in the 5-odd-limit (with 5:4 and 6:5 in this role); and<br/>decatonic music in the 7-odd-limit (7:4, 7:5, and 7:6). Complex Gothic<br/>polyphony may represent a different category: it is in these terms a<br/>&quot;3-limit diatonic&quot; system based on the complete 2:3:4 trine, and using<br/>mostly diatonic steps combined with various types of accidental<br/>inflections, regularly required in the 14th century for &quot;closest<br/>approach.&quot; Gothic schemes of concord/discord often focus on the usual<br/>13 or 14 diatonic intervals from unison to octave inclusive (depending<br/>on whether one counts the tritone and diminished fifth separately, as<br/>Jacobus of Liege does), but certain 14th-century theorists also<br/>consider certain chromatic intervals such as the augmented sixth<br/>(Jacobus, c. 1325) or diminished fourth (Johannes Boen, 1357).<br/>Marchettus of Padua (1318) and his school use the chromatic semitone<br/>or apotome as a direct melodic step.</p><p>7. This diatonic set also includes the major third C-E, which however<br/>has no stable fifth within the set to which it can resolve: the<br/>adjacent steps B-F form a diminished fifth. In the eight-note regular<br/>medieval gamut of Bb-B, a resolution to the fifth Bb-F is possible<br/>(and thus cadences such as C4-E4-A4 to Bb3-F4-Bb4). In such a cadence,<br/>one might posit a different &quot;local diatonic set&quot; Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E. This<br/>kind of approach involving seven-note diatonic sets, while distinct<br/>from the medieval system of hexachords and mutations based on six-note<br/>sets, may be somewhat congenial to it.

Maybe one moral is that we all need to compare notes (and<br/>intonations), as is happening in this thread.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Paul&apos;s article and my commentary: some questions<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>First, Paul, in responding to your germinal article of 1998 in<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ 17, I might say that in its scope it reminds me<br/>something of the writings of Joseph Yasser, whose _Medieval Quartal<br/>Harmony_ was a major influence on me during my college years. Of<br/>course, you cite various other sources also, at once gleaning valuable<br/>concepts and showing that these concepts of diatonicity or the like<br/>are not specific to 12-tone equal temperament (12-tET), as has<br/>sometimes been supposed in 20th-century presentations.</p><p>In my cadential analysis inspired by this paper, I wanted to emphasize<br/>possible common ground, and might now note some possible distinctions<br/>between related but not necessarily equivalent concepts.</p><p>For example, your &quot;characteristic dissonance&quot; and my &quot;directed<br/>instability&quot; are obviously related, and in 18th-century tonality they<br/>happen to be synonymous. However, while major-third-to-fifth is<br/>certainly a form of &quot;directed instability&quot; in the 14th century, can it<br/>be called a &quot;characteristic&quot; one, since in any seven-note diatonic<br/>scale -- or six-note hexachord, for that matter -- there are at least<br/>_two_ major thirds, and the major third is not produced from the same<br/>number of scale steps as any stable consonance?</p><p>A neo-Yasserian might cleverly argue that the dynamic role of the<br/>major third in 14th-century verticality suggests a &quot;pentatonic&quot;<br/>element in this music, since as you show the major third is a<br/>&quot;characteristic dissonance&quot; in a pentatonic scale.</p><p>Maybe one point here might be the advantages of recognizing two<br/>variables or dimensions for this kind of analysis: the type of scale<br/>structure, and the point of stable saturation in a given style.</p><p>For example, Yasser&apos;s scheme setting some of the background for your<br/>paper seems to suggest in Partchian terms &quot;3-limit pentatonic; 5-limit<br/>diatonic; 7-limit decatonic.&quot; This appears to me to be the main<br/>theoretical ground you cover, and it&apos;s an immense territory in itself,<br/>especially for one paper of less than 30 printed pages which not only<br/>addresses such comparative and historical issues but maps out the<br/>basis for a new musical practice.</p><p>However, an artistic road I happen to be on, maybe with some curious<br/>company, is to keep the saturation point fairly simple but use an<br/>intricate scale system with lots of shades of instability and<br/>chromatic or enharmonic &quot;surprises.&quot;</p><p>For example, while a Yasserian paradigm might predict that the point<br/>of saturation will be different in 19-tET or 31-tET than in 12-tET,<br/>all three systems can be used, for example, for Renaissance or<br/>&quot;5-limit modal&quot; styles with thirds and sixths as the most complex<br/>stable concords. This was Vicentino&apos;s approach, and is also mine in a<br/>24-note version of 1/4-comma meantone when I&apos;m following a<br/>&quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; style.</p><p>An even more dramatic example, of course, is later Gothic polyphonic<br/>based on the stable trine of 2:3:4 (&quot;3-limit&quot; saturation) and using<br/>all 12 notes of a Pythagorean chromatic tuning -- or a larger one, as<br/>with the 15 notes called for by Solage around 1400 (Gb-G#), or the<br/>17-note Pythagorean gamut proposed by Prosdocimus and Ugolino in the<br/>early 15th century (Gb-A#).</p><p>Neo-Gothic music carries this kind of &quot;complex 3-limit&quot; development<br/>yet further with tuning systems where a diatonic semitone is divided<br/>into a cadential &quot;diesis&quot; serving as a kind of semitone in its own<br/>right, for example, and a smaller commalike interval. Here, too,<br/>there&apos;s a kind of precedent in Marchettus of Padua (1318), and his<br/>&quot;fivefold division of the tone&quot; -- however problematically interpreted<br/>-- provides inspiration for lots of neo-Gothic experimentation.</p><p>Another basic issue: should the intervals and melodic motions used at<br/>a decisive cadence generally be present within a given diatonic scale<br/>or mode itself, for example, or may they result from fluid accidental<br/>inflections? In a very large portion of the music I play, improvise,<br/>and compose, the second kind of situation applies.</p><p>While people trained mainly in a major/minor kind of tonal system<br/>might be able to speak to this point better than I can, I do prefer to<br/>use terms other than &quot;key&quot; or &quot;modulation&quot; because it seems that they<br/>may imply the first kind of situation where the second actually<br/>applies. Instead, I may speak of &quot;transpositions&quot; or &quot;mutations&quot; or<br/>the like.</p><p>Also, for 16th-century music, my concept of &quot;directed instability&quot; may<br/>be rather less clear than for 14th-century music -- or 18th-century<br/>music, for that matter. It&apos;s easy to show how 14th-century or<br/>18th-century cadences use unstable intervals to make a sense of<br/>inherent vertical tension very clear; with 16th-century cadences,<br/>things can be more ambiguous, especially if we disregard the vital<br/>role of the suspension, for example.</p><p>Of course, that very &quot;ambiguity&quot; may be part of the beauty of<br/>16th-century music: in Partchian terms, one might speak of traditional<br/>&quot;3-limit&quot; resolutions guiding motion between &quot;5-limit&quot; sonorities. I&apos;m<br/>almost tempted to speak of thirds and sixths in a kind of orbital<br/>free-fall, and Zarlino&apos;s doctrine of the imperfect and perfect<br/>concords seems to me not unconsonant with such an appreciation.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>2. Stylistic viewpoints: comparing notes<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>Graham, you have raised an important question on which others have<br/>commented also: the relationship between stylistic particularities and<br/>general patterns or musical commonalities.</p><p>First, as someone mainly focused specifically on medieval and<br/>Renaissance European music and modern offshoots, I might suggest that<br/>a musician and scholar such as Daniel Wolf, with his awesome<br/>cross-cultural and historical scope, might have a unique kind of<br/>perspective to contribute here.</p><p>Also, a musician such as Haresh Bakshi trained in the practice and<br/>theory of the 22 srutis of India, and the musical system of which they<br/>are a part, has an invaluable perspective to share, one informed not<br/>only by intonational concepts but a revered oral tradition of teaching<br/>and learning.</p><p>Further, an artist such as Judith Conrad, who can not only expertly<br/>perform a composition of Bach on the harpsichord, but tune the<br/>instrument by ear in an appropriate well-temperament, may have special<br/>insights to share in a dialogue intimately embracing within its scope<br/>the music of this era.</p><p>What I would want to emphasize at the beginning of this kind of<br/>discussion is that each style has its own logic. As someone who has<br/>sometimes felt less than satisfied with attempts to analyze my beloved<br/>14th-century music in 18th-century terms, I would emphasize that for<br/>me to attempt to reverse this process would likely prove equally<br/>unsatisfactory.</p><p>Sometimes styles can differ rather dramatically in their patterns of<br/>concord/discord and intonation, for example, while sharing important<br/>common assumptions.</p><p>For example, over the last three decades and a bit more, I&apos;ve found<br/>myself in a kind of delicate balance between Gothic and Renaissance<br/>leanings, each style exerting its own pull and fascination.</p><p>If asked to say what elements these styles might share in common,<br/>maybe I&apos;d reply that it&apos;s a kind of &quot;Polyphony&quot; -- a term I use in a<br/>possibly new sense by analogy with Partch&apos;s &quot;Monophony&quot; -- a system<br/>where intervals and cadences can be organized around a subtle balance<br/>of centers.</p><p>This might be in contrast to either &quot;Monophony&quot; -- tonality with all<br/>notes ideally focused on a single center -- or what I&apos;m tempted to<br/>call &quot;Isophony,&quot; a kind of isotropic musical space where all points<br/>seem of identical and symmetrical importance, with &quot;pantonalism&quot; as<br/>one possible example (whether based on 12 tones or some other number).</p><p>To be prudent, I&apos;ll stress that &quot;monophony&quot; (music for a single<br/>melodic line) and &quot;polyphony&quot; (music with more than one note or<br/>melodic line sounding at the same time) have more conventional<br/>meanings; but given the Partch centennial, I couldn&apos;t resist a bit of<br/>play with his use of &quot;Monophony.&quot;</p><p>In the process of comparing notes, we may find that some viewpoints<br/>are more common than others, but each style-specific viewpoint is<br/>equally precious for describing its own most familiar music -- and<br/>potentially equally invalid when taken as a universal grammar of<br/>music.</p><p>By the way, Monz, I want enthusiastically to agree with your point<br/>about the benefits of technique, a technique sometimes informed by<br/>theory as well as vice versa.</p><p>For example, a couple of years ago or so, I was fortunate enough to<br/>learn a bit of the four-voice keyboard approach of Tomas de Santa<br/>Maria (1565). He is describing especially the art of _fantasia_,<br/>likely meaning mainly &quot;improvisation,&quot; in four parts.</p><p>One basic idea is to focus on the intervals formed by the outer voices<br/>at an octave, tenth, twelfth, fifteenth, etc., with the inner voices<br/>making &quot;differences&quot; or additional intervals which add consonances and<br/>fill in the space.</p><p>In addition to enriching my analysis and improvisation, I find that<br/>this approach can also be helpful in learning a new piece,<br/>complementing rather than substituting for musical empathy with<br/>another composer based on sheer experience in writing or playing in<br/>similar styles.</p><p>Graham, I suspect that in some ways Classic and jazz styles may share<br/>common assumptions different from those of medieval styles, although<br/>if we took a comparative perspective, we might hear interesting<br/>similarities and differences with other world musics.</p><p>This leads me to conclude on a cautious note. While period-specific<br/>assumptions may have impeded the development of a paradigm for common<br/>patterns shared by different eras of Western European composition, I<br/>wonder if in some ways this might be a fortunate thing.</p><p>My concern would be that a &quot;unified theory of [Western European]<br/>music&quot; might tend to marginalize other world musics even more than the<br/>less theoretically tidy canon of analysis during the past century.</p><p>One effect of the marginal status of the European medieval music I<br/>love was to encourage me to explore other world musics also, in part<br/>to show that &quot;strange&quot; features of Gothic composition (as described in<br/>some of the literature to which I was exposed) are found in other<br/>cultures, and in oral as well as notated traditions. Both in asserting<br/>that medieval verticality is a system in its own right, and by seeking<br/>out cross-cultural comparisons (for example with Chinese music),<br/>Joseph Yasser lent me some encouragement in this kind of exploration.</p><p>May I caution to say that such a sampling does not necessarily avoid a<br/>certain ethnocentricism: &quot;This Burmese song is so like Machaut.&quot; Once<br/>again, the &quot;common patterns&quot; one recognizes may say as much about the<br/>listener as about the musical language being heard.</p><p>In response to your comments, Joe Pehrson, I would therefore say that<br/>analyses at different levels are fine -- as long as we recognize the<br/>hazards of generalizations which may sometimes distract from as well<br/>as clarify stylistic particulars.</p><p>Above all, as a medievalist in the European tradition, I would caution<br/>against &quot;universal grammars&quot; of music which are in fact partial<br/>explanations of European composition.

This was Vicentino&apos;s approach, and is also mine in a<br/>&gt; 24-note version of 1/4-comma meantone when I&apos;m following a<br/>&gt; &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; style.</p><p>That&apos;s also my philosophy (it&apos;s one way I differ from Yasser), and the 31-tET case is one I like to<br/>point out to those who overemphasize the ME property (the diatonic scale is not ME in<br/>31-tET).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This leads me to conclude on a cautious note. While period-specific<br/>&gt; assumptions may have impeded the development of a paradigm for common<br/>&gt; patterns shared by different eras of Western European composition, I<br/>&gt; wonder if in some ways this might be a fortunate thing.</p><p>Certainly!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My concern would be that a &quot;unified theory of [Western European]<br/>&gt; music&quot; might tend to marginalize other world musics even more than the<br/>&gt; less theoretically tidy canon of analysis during the past century.</p><p>In what context do you have this concern?</p></div><h3><a id=25824 href="#25824">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2001 12:37:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo wrote,</p><p>&gt; A commendable aspect of your article, Paul, is that it does look<br/>into<br/>&gt; some different cultural traditions, including the 22 srutis of India<br/>&gt; (with mention of Ramon Satyendra as an advisor, possibly in this<br/>&gt; connection?)</p><p>Not at all.
