Also, the Thai govt kicked one<br/>movie maker out of the country recently...they are remaking &quot;The King<br/>and I,&quot; and insist on presenting the King of Thailand as a bozo...so,<br/>they were told to make the movie elsewhere. Yeeha, white folks strike<br/>again...also, BTW, I personally don&apos;t care if an occasional post about<br/>non tuning related items is presented here...I&apos;d like to feel that my<br/>esteemed colleagues and I are just the sort of folks who would be<br/>outraged at environmental destruction and such, so I don&apos;t mind hearing<br/>about those sorts of things...Hstick (PS...heard some music composed by<br/>the King of Tland once...it was a saxophone quartet, and the music<br/>sounded like 1940&apos;s swing...not what I was expecting...)</p></div>
