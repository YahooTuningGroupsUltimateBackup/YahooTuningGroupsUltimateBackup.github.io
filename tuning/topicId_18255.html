Certainly people on this<br/>list, notably Joe Monzo and Robert Walker, have been using this Yahoo<br/>e-mail service for a long time.  It&apos;s great for travelling... just<br/>stop at ANY computer attached to the Internet!</p><p>__________ ______ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=18265 href="#18265">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/3/2001 7:51:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alita Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt; Please someone explain in detail how do I find the polI place on the<br/>&gt; Yahoo =<br/>&gt; webpage?<br/>&gt;     I clicked on the Yahoo webpage and was required to fill in Yahoo ID<br/>&gt; and=<br/>&gt;  password.

There&apos;s a link for upgrading your<br/>eGroups/OneList account, but you still have to fill in the new membership<br/>form.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div>
