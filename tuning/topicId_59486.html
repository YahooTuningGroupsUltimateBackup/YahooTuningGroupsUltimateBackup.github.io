There is a lot of published<br/>psychological research on this in the musical realm; I don&apos;t have any<br/>references handy but I used to sit in the library poring over this<br/>stuff. In fact, over a few intense weeks it&apos;s possible to re-train a<br/>subject&apos;s categorical interval classifications. Spend a few weeks<br/>with a very unfamiliar tuning system and I guarantee you&apos;ll suprise<br/>yourself not only with how differently you come to hear the new<br/>tuning system, but how differently you hear 12-equal when you first<br/>go back to it. Nothing substitutes for real experience in this area.</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2005 8:24:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Lorenzo,</p><p>You wrote:<br/>&gt; I would like to have a bibliography about what I would<br/>&gt; call &quot;categoric perception&quot; of sounds.<br/>&gt; Most musicians have just twelve categories for intervals<br/>&gt; where any couple of notes can stay.

Our cultures, more<br/>specifically our languages, provide most of our categories.<br/>Many languages had no need for the category &quot;orange&quot;, so<br/>never had a word for it.  Asked to describe the colour of<br/>some seen object, witnesses reply in terms of the colour<br/>categories they are used to; there&apos;s even evidence that<br/>they remember the category rather than the raw percept.</p><p>So a witness whose language contains no word for &quot;orange&quot;<br/>will describe an orange as being either &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;red&quot;,<br/>depending on the categories his language provides.</p><p>Some things are innate - the ability to perceive the whole<br/>of the visible colour spectrum is innate to most humans,<br/>but not all.  The physical capacity for speech is innate, but<br/>the mental capacity is a product of environment - it has to<br/>be learned.  Feral children don&apos;t learn human speech unless<br/>they are acculturated early enough.</p><p>&gt; Some studies on the &quot;neanderthal flute&quot; seems to prove<br/>&gt; that neanderthal man played a flute based on something<br/>&gt; like a diatonic tetrachord; in this sense we are not so far<br/>&gt; from him... I would say that, to *describe* the colors of<br/>&gt; a black and white picture, we just need three categories:<br/>&gt; &quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot; and &quot;gray&quot; with the addition of &quot;bright&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;dark&quot;... Is this just a cultural habit? Do we need to<br/>&gt; create new words for any particular kind of gray? I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not sure.</p><p>Of this I&apos;m sure!  :-)  When you take your heavy rice-paper<br/>and your black ink, to start learning the Japanese art of<br/>sumi-e, one of the first things you learn is that mastery<br/>includes the ability to paint in _seven_ distinct tones<br/>between white and black - just by varying the amount of<br/>water you use with the ink.  In English, we only commonly<br/>distinguish (medium) grey, light grey and dark grey.  To<br/>discuss the different tones with my sumi-e teacher, we<br/>needed names, so I spoke of &quot;the palest grey&quot;, &quot;the lighter<br/>medium grey&quot; and so on.  In the end, I started using numbers<br/>instead.  So &quot;Do we need to create new words for any<br/>particular kind of gray?&quot; has a clear answer for me - &quot;Yes,<br/>whenever our circumstances require convenient labels for<br/>them; otherwise, no.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Maybe people which plays outside conventional tuning<br/>&gt; systems tend to think in this manner: &quot;a major third&quot;,<br/>&gt; &quot;a minor third&quot;, &quot;something in the middle&quot;... That&apos;s all.<br/>&gt; I think this is also a bluesman thought.</p><p>Sometimes, while pushing notes around, you tend to think<br/>instead of how far you&apos;ve pushed them - more a number on<br/>a (continuous) scale than a category.</p><p>&gt; Using intellect we can go deeper developing ways,<br/>&gt; instruments and words to describe everything scientifically<br/>&gt; (apperception?) but maybe our instinctive perception would<br/>&gt; always remains in a simplified reality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lorenzo</p><p>We can only clearly label those things we can clearly<br/>perceive, recall or imagine.  Otherwise the label has no<br/>referent.  I don&apos;t believe we have a great deal of access<br/>to our &quot;instinctive perception&quot;, particularly after infancy,<br/>when most of our perceptions are mediated through<br/>language.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.9.5/58 - Release Date: 25/7/05</p></div>
