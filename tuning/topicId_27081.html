Schlick 1511: "wohltemperirt"?</h1><h3>ha.kellner@t-online.de</h3><span>8/15/2001 9:44:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear members,</p><p>In my booklet (I&apos;m now not trying here to &quot;sell carrotts!&quot;)<br/>&quot;Wie stimme ich selbst mein Cembalo?&quot;, 3rd edition; English version<br/>out of print, (called &quot;The Tuning of my Harpsichord&quot;),<br/>I wrote, p. 19, Cap. 2.3:</p><p>my own free translation - not very satisfactory for me:</p><p>The beats are that important; thus, a nice experiment should be<br/>mentioned. To this aim, all you you need is two different combs.<br/>If you put them side aside or one atop the other, will produce<br/>graphic beat-patterns. These arise from the regular, but different<br/>periodicity of the comb&apos;s teeth. This phenonomenon is called, after<br/>Moir&iuml;&iquest;&half;, Moir&iuml;&iquest;&half; pattern.</p><p>It appears that Arnold Schlick in 1511 had already fully understood<br/>in his &quot;Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten&quot; the character of<br/>beats. In fact, in Cap. VIII, fol. XV he brilliantly formulates:<br/>&quot;da&iuml;&iquest;&half; sich dabei ETWAS SPERRT UND MEHR ODER WENIGER INEINANDER BEGEHRT&quot;<br/>              something is blocking itself thereby and strives to greater and<br/>lesser extent together.</p><p>Could Schlick&apos;s statement convey anything different in this context<br/>of the beats than his profounf understanding? Supposing he has<br/>understood the beat&apos;s mechanism, WHY should he refrained from<br/>taking advantage of these beats and to utilize them<br/>for tuning his organ.</p><p>By the way: His tuning instructions are difficult to interpret<br/>and even more difficult to convert into clearcut, non-ambiguous<br/>tuning instructions.</p><p>advocatus diaboli:<br/>Who is capable of identifying an intrinsic<br/>discrepancy between Schlick&apos;s prescription for tuning and<br/>the result of &quot;Werckmeister/Bach/wohltemperirt????</p><p>In this regard I&apos;m having difficulties!</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Herbert-Anton</p><p>Paul Erlich schrieb:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Dear Tuners,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Below is a translation of an excerpt from Marin<br/>&gt; Mersenne&apos;s &quot;Harmonie<br/>&gt; &gt; Universelle&quot; (1634) concerning tuning keyboards by beats. Isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; this earlier<br/>&gt; &gt; than Owen Jorgensen accepts?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Johnny Reinhard<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [&quot;]But it is necessary to experiment how many<br/>&gt; &gt; times the pipes, or the parts of air which are pushed or enclosed<br/>&gt; within,<br/>&gt; &gt; sound beats in all the distances from unison and the other<br/>&gt; consonances, if<br/>&gt; &gt; one wishes to learn the universal method of tuning the organ.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     &quot;Now this consideration of beats serves not only for<br/>&gt; recognizing the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning and temperament of the organ, but also as the object of an<br/>&gt; excellent<br/>&gt; &gt; speculation which consists in searching for the causes of this<br/>&gt; throbbing,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is different according as the pipes are more or less removed<br/>&gt; from the<br/>&gt; &gt; consonances, since they beat as much when they are lacking a diesis<br/>&gt; of making<br/>&gt; &gt; a unison, as when they are removed by a major second and an equal<br/>&gt; distance<br/>&gt; &gt; from the fifth does not make them beat like that of the unison.<br/>&gt; Thus it is<br/>&gt; &gt; necessary to consider these distances in as many manners as there<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; consonances; for as to the dissonances, they make the pipes beat<br/>&gt; and throb<br/>&gt; &gt; even when they are in the exact intervals.  Yet one can consider<br/>&gt; whether they<br/>&gt; &gt; make them tremble more or less when they are just than when they<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;         Marin Mersenne (1634) Proposition XXX (p. 450)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny, does Mersenne go on to provide a means of _calculating_ beat<br/>&gt; frequencies? Because it appears that what he is saying here, is that<br/>&gt; one has to know how to set the temperament first _by other means_;<br/>&gt; then one can observe _empirically_ and count the beating; and then<br/>&gt; use these counts to set the temperament in the future -- and that a<br/>&gt; mathematical theory of beating is a matter for future &quot;searching&quot;.<br/>&gt; Jorgenson may have overlooked this, but it&apos;s a far cry from actually<br/>&gt; _calculating_ the correct beat frequencies a priori.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nonetheless, I recall reading in Jorgenson that the theory of beat<br/>&gt; frequencies was fully understood long before any tuners actually<br/>&gt; _used_ this theory to tune. But how could Jorgenson know what _all_<br/>&gt; tuners did or did not use?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br/>&gt; email.
