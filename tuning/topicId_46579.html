kirnberger, who proposed tuning 12-equal exactly in this way --<br/>&gt; subtracting a schisma from each of the pythagorean fifths. the<br/>&gt; schisma is not exactly 1/12 pythagorean comma, which would be<br/>&gt; irrational -- rather, the schisma is the just ratio 32805:32768,<br/>&gt; which can be derived from a chain of eight just fifths and a just<br/>&gt; major third. the result of doing as kirnberger suggested will yield<br/>a<br/>&gt; 12-tone chain that falls short of closing on itself by the ratio<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2923003274661805836407369665432566039311865085952<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 2922977339492680612451840826835216578535400390625<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or, more usefully, 2^161 * 3^-84 * 5^-12, or [161 -84 -12] for<br/>short.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if, as carl suggested, you went to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4xuu">http://tinyurl.com/4xuu</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but then clicked on &quot;last&quot; and scrolled down to the bottom, you<br/>would<br/>&gt; see that i&apos;ve called this the &quot;atom of kirnberger&quot; and it&apos;s only<br/>&gt; 0.015361 cent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the atom of kirnberger is not only the difference between 12<br/>schismas<br/>&gt; and a pythagorean comma, it&apos;s also the difference between 11<br/>schismas<br/>&gt; and a syntonic comma. since it&apos;s so small, it&apos;s typically ignored,<br/>&gt; and so it&apos;s said that these 11-schisma and 12-schisma constructions<br/>&gt; are exact. they&apos;re not.</p><p>***This is a great post.
