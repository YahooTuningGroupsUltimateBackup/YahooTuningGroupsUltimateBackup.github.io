The only<br/>microtonal instruments I have around the house now are<br/>refretted guitars, and as I keep proclaiming loudly,<br/>I ain&apos;t no guitarist!</p><p>The reason I started hanging out at Starr Labs was because<br/>I wanted a MicroZone.  Then when I started working there I<br/>become fond of the Zboard.  But since I realized that Canasta<br/>as well as the full 72-EDO can map so easily to the Ztar,<br/>and that&apos;s the lowest-priced instrument made at Starr Labs,<br/>I decided to go that way... until I can afford a MicroZone.</p><p>The MicroZone will be much more useful for my theoretical<br/>work... and of course would be even better for the very<br/>extended JI composing that I like to do.

Does this instrument have<br/>&gt; STRINGS or KEYS??  Maybe I looked at the wrong diagram...<br/>&gt; Or do they BOTH have keys... (??)</p><p>As I&apos;ve said, Joe, the Starr Labs Ztar is a hybrid, with<br/>both strings *and* keys.</p><p>There are a lot of different models of Ztar... it&apos;s Harvey&apos;s<br/>main product.  Take a look at this picture of a typical<br/>Mini-Z, giving a good view of the string area and the keyboard:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.starrlabs.com/5.html">http://www.starrlabs.com/5.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>Harvey&apos;s original idea for this instrument came from a<br/>dissatisfaction with the way regular guitar synthesizers<br/>work.</p><p>A vibrating string exhibits extremely complex phenomena,<br/>and while I&apos;d guess that engineers have learned how to<br/>construct and program pickups and sensors so that they<br/>can detect probably any aspect of it, honing in on *exactly*<br/>the aspect desired by the player has turned out to be a<br/>very difficult thing to achieve.  It&apos;s particularly a<br/>problem in trying to ascertain a fretted pitch.</p><p>So Harvey got completely around that difficulty by eliminating<br/>the need to detect pitch from the string, instead using<br/>the keyboard to determine pitch.  The keyboard replaces<br/>the guitar fingerboard, and in fact Harvey refers to the<br/>two dimensions of the array arrangement of keys as &quot;strings&quot;<br/>and &quot;frets&quot;.  The Ztar has 6 &quot;strings&quot; x 24 &quot;frets&quot;, similar<br/>to a standard guitar (except that most 12-EDO guitars don&apos;t<br/>have quite that many frets).</p><p>The strings are only used in the picking/strumming area of<br/>the guitar body, to transmit articulation data.  They are<br/>not necessary, and if you browse thru the Starr Labs<br/>Gallery you&apos;ll see some Ztars without strings.  Here<br/>are two &lt;<a href="http://www.starrlabs.com/9.html">http://www.starrlabs.com/9.html</a>&gt; and<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.starrlabs.com/10.html">http://www.starrlabs.com/10.html</a>&gt; which have sensors<br/>instead of strings.  The player touches these to get drum<br/>sounds, etc.</p><p>So the one I&apos;m getting will be just a keyboard and a box<br/>to hold the electronics, and possibly a guitar neck if<br/>I decide that being able to play the keyboard like that<br/>is worth the extra expense.  Because of the unique key<br/>design (thin and long... relatively speaking; these keys<br/>are *much* smaller than regular keyboard keys) it&apos;s just<br/>as easy (and possibly easier) to play this instrument<br/>with hands on either side of the keyboard as with hands<br/>both on the same side (as with a regular Halberstadt<br/>keyboard).</p><p>(Joe, you&apos;ve got me busy today... I was in the midst of<br/>putting together a detailed answer about your MIDI pitch-bend<br/>question when I saw this...)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
