Using this<br/>approach, we find that a 7/26-comma tuning gives the optimization of<br/>this kind for the ideal meantone concords of the 3:2 fifth, 5:4 major<br/>third, and 6:5 minor third.</p><p>Also, reading and rereading _Xenharmonikon_ 17 has introduced me,<br/>Michael Saunders, to your most readable and engaging article on<br/>&quot;Rusty&quot; and fuzzy logic in optimizing a tuning. What an honor it is to<br/>have an opportunity to exchange ideas with such an author.[1]</p><p>Interestingly, Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s Scala program uses a &quot;Pythagorean&quot;<br/>category for any tuning built from a single repeated generator, and<br/>terms this generator the &quot;formal fifth,&quot; regardless of the size of the<br/>interval.</p><p>Here I shall consider a variation on a tuning documented by Manuel in<br/>the Scala archive file temp31g3.scl with a generator of ~233.985<br/>cents, or precisely 1/3 the size of a pure fifth at 3:2 (~701.955<br/>cents). In &quot;fine-tuning&quot; this scheme according to Paul&apos;s least sum of<br/>squares ideal, we deal with some interval quite different than those<br/>in the meantone problem, and yet come up with a temperament involving<br/>a curiously similar fraction of a comma (or maybe more accurately a<br/>schisma).</p><p>A Scala file for this temperament in a 31-note version is included<br/>below.</p><p>In approaching this problem, we might first consider its<br/>&quot;non-meantone&quot; nature, starting with a possible definition of<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; as fulfilling these conditions, with some room for<br/>flexibility in the &quot;border&quot; regions, so to speak:</p><p>      (1) The tuning is built from a chain of identically<br/>          sized generators, specifically &quot;fifths&quot; not too far<br/>          from a ratio of 3:2;</p><p>      (2) Regular major thirds are formed from chains of four<br/>          such identical fifths up (e.g. F-A from F-C-G-D-A),<br/>          or from two equal major seconds or whole-tones<br/>          (e.g. F-A from F-G-A);</p><p>      (3) In a meantone tuning, these major thirds are more<br/>          specifically targeted at 5:4, and minor thirds at<br/>          6:5, with fifths tempered in the narrow direction<br/>          to achieve or approximate these ratios.</p><p>Here it may bear emphasis that a tuning may fulfill conditions (1) and<br/>(2) but target sizes of thirds other than 5:4 or 6:5, and thus fall in<br/>some category other than a &quot;meantone&quot; as usually defined.</p><p>Pythagorean tuning is one obvious example: regular major and minor<br/>thirds at 81:64 and 32:27 are superb for much of the music of Gothic<br/>Europe, and for &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; music in similar styles.</p><p>Also, various tunings I favor in my &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; music temper the<br/>fifths gently in the _wide_ direction in order to attain ratios such<br/>as 14:11 for major thirds, or 13:11 or 33:28 for minor thirds. In<br/>22-tET, four fifths give us a major third very close to a pure 9:7,<br/>also a favorite neo-Gothic size.</p><p>Thus meantone is only one part of the spectrum of &quot;tunings with<br/>regular fifths fairly close to 3:2 where major thirds are regularly<br/>formed from chains of four such intervals.&quot;</p><p>For our optimization problem, however, we move to a tuning built on<br/>quite a different paradigm, with identical generators at around 1/3<br/>the size of a pure fifth (~233.985 cents), or close to the size of an<br/>8:7 or septimal whole-tone (~231.174 cents).</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. A four-interval optimization for least sum of squares<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s tuning, apparently related to an observation by<br/>the great Netherlands physicist and musician Adriaan Fokker famed for<br/>the modern revival of 31-tET, the generator is equal precisely to a<br/>third part of 3:2, so that three such generators form a pure fifth.</p><p>While Manuel is the person to decide on a name for this tuning, I here<br/>refer to it informally as a &quot;Manuel-tone&quot; tuning, by playful analogy<br/>to &quot;meantone.&quot;</p><p>Here we approach the problem of optimizing one of the favorite<br/>sonorities of neo-Gothic style, a septimal &quot;quad&quot; or tetrad with<br/>ratios of 12:14:18:21 (a rounded 0-267-702-969 cents) or 14:18:21:24<br/>(a rounded 0-435-702-933 cents).</p><p>In seeking a least sum of squares variation from pure ratios for this<br/>sonority, we must consider four intervals:</p><p>1. The 3:2 fifth or 4:3 fourth;<br/>2. The 9:7 major third;<br/>3. The 7:6 minor third or 12:7 major sixth; and<br/>4. The 8:7 major second or 7:4 minor seventh.</p><p>While it is impossible to get more than one of these four categories<br/>of intervals pure in a repeated-identical-generator tuning, our<br/>purpose is to minimize the overall sum of squares error or variation.</p><p>Here our generator is around the size of the 8:7, or of 3:2^1/3, so<br/>that our first step is to consider the number of generators required<br/>to produce each of our four categories of intervals, in the case of<br/>the 9:7 subtracting an octave:</p><p>    1 generator up  =  ~8:7<br/>    3 generators up =  ~3:2<br/>    4 generators up = ~12:7<br/>    7 generators up =  ~9:7</p><p>In seeking the best compromise between these four categories, our<br/>relevant comma -- also arguably a kind of schisma[2] -- is the<br/>1029:1024 (~8.43 cents) defining the difference between three pure 8:7<br/>septimal whole-tones up and a pure 3:2 fifth.</p><p>Taking the generator of the scale as the object of &quot;temperament,&quot; we<br/>can determine the amount of temperament needed to make each category<br/>pure, measuring our tempering (t) in fractions of the 1029:1024 comma<br/>or schisma (analogous to the 81:80 syntonic comma as a measure of<br/>meantone temperaments):</p><p>7:4 or 8:7  = ~231.174 cents (pure at t = 0)<br/>7:6 or 12:7 = ~266.871 cents (pure at t = 1/4, ~233.282 cents)<br/>9:7 or 14:9 = ~435.084 cents (pure at t = 2/7, ~233.583 cents)<br/>3:2 or 4:3  = ~701.955 cents (pure at t = 1/3, ~233.985 cents)</p><p>An historical aside: it is fascinating that the fractions of our<br/>1029:1024 ratio required to make our categories other than 8:7 or 7:4<br/>pure happen to coincide with those of the three meantone temperaments<br/>discussed by Zarlino (1558, 1571) and Salinas (1577): 1/4-comma (pure<br/>5:4); 1/3-comma (pure 6:5); and 2/7-comma (5:4 and 6:5 equally impure,<br/>25:24 pure).</p><p>Here, however, tempering our near-8:7 generator by 1/4 of our<br/>1029:1024 comma gives a pure septimal _minor_ third at 7:6, or major<br/>sixth at 12:7; tempering at 1/3-comma gives a pure 3:2 fifth; and<br/>tempering at 2/7-comma gives a pure 9:7 major third.</p><p>Using a bit of calculus -- with me, a _bare_ minimum, since refreshing<br/>myself on the Chain Rule might permit a more elegant set of steps to<br/>the solution -- we can find the amount of temperament resulting in<br/>least sum of squares error or variation from pure.</p><p>My crude calculus yields such a sum of squares at 7/25-comma, or a<br/>temperament of the ~8:7 generator at ~2.36116 cents, or a generator<br/>for least sum of squares on 12:14:18:21 at ~233.53526 cents.</p><p>Th generator&apos;s sum of squares is ~8.5332925438385603114, the smallest<br/>I can recall among tunings other than those combining just ratios of 3<br/>and 7.</p><p>This 7/25-comma solution involves a fraction very close to the<br/>7/26-comma meantone solution advocated by Woodhouse and explicated<br/>here by Paul. Since in both problems one interval category is pure<br/>with no temperament, another with 1/4 of the relevant comma, and<br/>another with 1/3 of this comma, this resemblance might not be so<br/>surprising. Here the factor of a fourth interval (the 9:7) pure at 2/7<br/>of this comma may pull the optimization toward a slightly larger<br/>amount of temperament for the generator.</p><p>Note also that this least sum of squares generator is very close to<br/>the 36-tET septimal major second or whole-tone at 7/36 octave, or<br/>precisely 233-1/3 cents.</p><p>Thus the tuning might very nicely be implemented in 36-tET, just as<br/>the &quot;Miracle Tuning&quot; with a generator of around 3/2^1/6 can be very<br/>nicely implemented as 7/72 octave in 72-tET.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>2.

Now it is a question of weighing the balance<br/>between these intervals -- and also the fifth, which ideally we would<br/>like to temper as gently as possible, or as efficiently as possible<br/>for our desired effect.</p><p>Here I have limited the general type of problem to one involving a<br/>chain of identical generators, whether conventional fifths or quite<br/>unconventional (as in Manuel&apos;s 233.985-cent tuning and its<br/>233.536-cent offshoot).</p><p>If one considers solutions involving _two_ 12-note chains of identical<br/>generators spaced at any desired interval, for example, then the<br/>possibilities are multiplied, including schemes combining some aspects<br/>of regular tunings and multi-prime just intonation systems.</p><p>Again, I would warmly like to thank Paul for educating me on the sum<br/>of squares optimization concept, Michael for discussions of &quot;Rusty&quot;<br/>and optimization which invite many fascinating scenarios, and Manuel<br/>for a scale at once inspiring in itself and offering an opportunity<br/>for this List&apos;s typical dialogues on &quot;fine-tuning.&quot;</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Michael Saunders, &quot;Pitch, Scale and Tuning in _Rusty_: A Fuzzy<br/>Logic Approach to the Tuning Problem,&quot; _Xenharmonikon 17_ (Spring<br/>1998), pp. 116-119. Maybe I might add that reading about the problem<br/>of wanting two 9:8 major seconds to add up to 5:4 major third rather<br/>than the 81:64 major third actually obtaining, I smiled to reflect<br/>that I find the Pythagorean third ideal for much of my music, and am<br/>very happy to have two 9:8 steps add up this way -- but thus<br/>presenting a less interesting situation from the viewpoint of your<br/>application&apos;s optimization process.</p><p>2. From one standpoint, the 1029:1024 is the difference between two<br/>commas, the 64:63 (~27.26 cents) distinguishing, for example, a<br/>Pythagorean major third at 81:64 (~407.82 cents) from a pure 9:7<br/>(435.08 cents); and the 49:48 (~35.70 cents) distinguishing a pure 8:7<br/>(~231.17 cents) from a pure 7:6 (~266.87 cents). Typically the<br/>difference of two commas is called a schisma. However, in our tunings<br/>with a generator of around 8:7 or 3:2^1/3, 1029:1024 might also be<br/>regarded as the &quot;comma&quot; defining the difference between a pure 3:2<br/>fifth and three pure 8:7&apos;s up. In the context of his scale, Manuel Op<br/>de Coul calls this 8.43-cent interval a &quot;gamelan residue,&quot; defining<br/>the amount by which four pure 8:7&apos;s plus a pure 7:6 exceed a 2:1<br/>octave.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 11:42:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here we approach the problem of optimizing one of the favorite<br/>&gt; sonorities of neo-Gothic style, a septimal &quot;quad&quot; or tetrad with<br/>&gt; ratios of 12:14:18:21 (a rounded 0-267-702-969 cents) or 14:18:21:24<br/>&gt; (a rounded 0-435-702-933 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In seeking a least sum of squares variation from pure ratios for this<br/>&gt; sonority, we must consider four intervals:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

We want 1 up so we enter 1 (or only<br/>a &lt;return&gt; to take the default 1). A negative value means going down.<br/>Then &quot;Enter weight&quot;.
