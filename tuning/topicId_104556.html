These unexpected features are due to the 624 cells equally distributed on six pages, 52 cells per page. The new and corrected version works with 51 cells per page. Each page repeats the M, J, U sequence of the first 51 cells that work now. The 612 cells with a 2/1 octave are given by the 12 x 51 system.</p><p>Information will be sent the coming week.</p><p>Mario</p><p>April 28</p></div>
