Arabic maqam Rast can be played with &quot;white&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; notes, but the &quot;blue&quot; notes are properly a quarter-comma flat. And a septimal pentatonic minor in C can be played with &quot;white&quot; and &quot;red&quot; notes, with the &quot;red&quot; notes a sixth-comma flat.

Terpstra&apos;s approach is different than mine; he uses a new color for each fifth away from zero, but the same color for both positive and negative numbers of fifths. I need to make out a circle of fifths in 53-tone demonstrating how I have chains of seven fifths colored a distinct color. 31-tone would use five colors, 19-tone three colors, and if I ever feel like going to 118-tone, I&apos;ll need 17 colors.</p><p>I&apos;m also attempting to apply the chains-of-seven concept towards a non-generalized keyboard layout, an &quot;&iuml;&iquest;&half;ber-Halberstadt&quot; if you will. The problem I&apos;m running into is having lower pitches positioned to the *right* of some keys.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div>
