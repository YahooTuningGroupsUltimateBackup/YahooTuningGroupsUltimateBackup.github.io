I don&apos;t know any more<br/>details and Yasser didn&apos;t say how well he liked the sound of 19-edo.<br/>But, at least he can&apos;t be accused of never having heard what he wrote<br/>about in<br/>&quot;A Theory of Evolving Tonality.&quot;</p><p>I presume this was in the 30&apos;s, but it could have been later. Yasser<br/>said he supported himself in Shanghai playing piano before he got to the<br/>US. He was a refugee from the the Russian revolution who went east<br/>rather than west through Europe to escape.</p><p>--John</p></div>
