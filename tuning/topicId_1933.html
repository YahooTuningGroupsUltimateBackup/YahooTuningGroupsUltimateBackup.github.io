What I am<br/>REALLY doing is having some fun and learning alot...particularly lately<br/>about lattice structures.<br/>And save your tuning history lessons for your students Bub.</p><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:stick@uswest.net">stick@uswest.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Hey Pat P...of course, I believe that when you say equal temps are<br/>&gt; &quot;yesterday&apos;s chicken salad,&quot; you are quite aware that you are going to<br/>&gt; piss some folks off, and start a minor tuning ruckus...what you&apos;re<br/>&gt; REALLY doing is revealing the smallness of your own personal concept<br/>&gt; about what constitutes good/great music, because as we all know, there<br/>&gt; has been much incredible music music written in equal temps, and there<br/>&gt; still is. On the other hand, I think a lot of the &quot;just&quot; music I have<br/>&gt; heard since becoming involved in this tuning odyssey leaves a lot to be<br/>&gt; desired in terms of musical quality(and of course, there is certainly<br/>&gt; great music in pure tunings). My feeling has been that for many tuning<br/>&gt; folks, their command of theory far exceeds their musical abilities...as<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always suggested, a lot of practice and study on one&apos;s instrument<br/>&gt; is not a bad idea. To quote the late, great Ivor Darreg from the Feb<br/>&gt; 1978 issue of Guitar Player: &quot;We have had several centuries of profound<br/>&gt; theoretical writings, but precious little to hear.&quot; Amen to that...and<br/>&gt; Pat, why would you want to say such an inflammatory thing in the first<br/>&gt; place? It just creates bad feelings, and serves no real purpose other<br/>&gt; than to make folks think that you have a ways to go before you really<br/>&gt; understand the deeper meanings of music and art. The real masters I have<br/>&gt; met, such as Erv Wilson, Johnny Reinhard, Ivor Darreg, John<br/>&gt; Schneider...they are more interested in the quality of the music, rather<br/>&gt; than the decimal points of a tuning system...it&apos;s not a bad lesson to<br/>&gt; learn, and I hope you and others like you eventually learn it...needless<br/>&gt; provocation is a waste of time for all...it gets old seeing such small<br/>&gt; minded commentary on a list such as this; we need to be talking about<br/>&gt; more important things...Hstick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Ta Da!
