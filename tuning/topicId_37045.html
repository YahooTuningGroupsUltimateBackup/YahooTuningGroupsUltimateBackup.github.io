In terms<br/>of the musical character, I was reminded of two things:  the<br/>contemplative enumerative structures of the visual artist Sol LeWitt;  the<br/>other vision I had was of a 19th-century score pamphlet, titled something<br/>like &quot;The Compleat Trombounist&quot;, some 19th-century compilation of famous<br/>march-tunes, but then you look into this compilation, and everything&apos;s<br/>freaked out and fragmented:  fragments of marches in the &apos;bone, and<br/>oompaapaa&apos;s at dozens of different tempi in the &quot;piano.&quot;  the microtones<br/>were negotiated fearlessly and expressively by Chris Washburne.  (who<br/>teaches jazz (trained as ethnomusicologist) at Columbia.)<br/>&#x9;Ivor Darreg&apos;s  &quot;Colorless Green Ideas sleep furiously&quot;, to my<br/>ears, the soundtrack to &quot;Deliverance&quot; put through the prism of 22tet, was most<br/>enjoyable and reminded me of Partch, especially with the composer&apos;s spoken<br/>introduction.  (i.e. HE reminded me of Partch anyway.)   I hadn&apos;t heard<br/>any of Darreg&apos;s music before.  It was nice to  catch up on that stuff.<br/>Interestingly, the 22tet harmony reminded me of  Paul&apos;s TIBIA quite a bit,<br/>they both certainly know their way around juicy  aspects of the<br/>temperament&apos;s harmonies. (I believe, at least in Darreg&apos;s<br/>case, it&apos;s lots of  faux-4:5:6:7 JI chords, realized of course in 22tet).<br/>&#x9;Marc Jones&apos;s guitar tunes presented lots o&apos; pop grooves and hooks.<br/>I was especially attracted to #2 (the lament, he called it)---its hooks<br/>were especially juicy for my ears.<br/>&#x9;The Wendy Carlos tune. . . I thought the performances of the<br/>&quot;acoustified&quot; lines were good (I particularly remember some fairly vivid<br/>choir (15tet harmonies), but I thought the mix could use a bit of &quot;Jacky<br/>Ligon&quot; Mastering Magic to pep it up and clarify it a bit.</p><p>&#x9;Well, those are  impressions I have with me now. . . . I have a<br/>horrible memory, so if I left anything important out, forgive me!!</p><p>C Bailey</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2002 7:37:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the review.

JR&apos;s a real marvel when it comes to<br/>getting things done and it seems like he&apos;s always full-steam-ahead<br/>when it comes to promoting microtonality... but I&apos;ve often wondered<br/>why the AFMM doesn&apos;t have something as equally ambitious and<br/>industrious going down on the recorded front--perhaps something akin<br/>to the Knitting Factory where the recorded product and the performance<br/>space make for a multifaceted entity that almost defines its own<br/>movement or genre.</p><p>I mean at this point JR and the AFMM have a sizeable historical track<br/>record of achievement and hard work on their side... and I just think<br/>something like that would go a long way towards &quot;legitimizing&quot; the<br/>whole enterprise and could quite possibly make the AFMM and JR<br/>something like the type of household words that say the Knitting<br/>Factory and other prolific New Yorkers such as John Zorn are... or at<br/>the very least raise the profile of microtonality while documenting<br/>the music and distributing it at the concerts et al... just some<br/>thoughts.</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Christopher Bailey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cb202@columbia.edu">cb202@columbia.edu</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, May 26, 2002 5:49 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] AFMM show</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thought I&apos;d share a few reactions to the AFMM show last night, May<br/>25,<br/>&gt; while they&apos;re still fresh in my mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Token, by Pat Glazier, was a gorgeous piece.

However, the<br/>industry is in tatters.  It seems to us at the AFMM that it is important to<br/>do things right.  This includes the packaging, the rights, the agreement of<br/>all players, etc.</p><p>Since the AFMM began in 1981 we have been told that there will be a right<br/>moment, as Dan seems to intuit, and it may be drawing near.  I just received<br/>the Brandenburg #4 AFMM recording and it sound great.  This summer we will<br/>continue to pursue the releasing of CDs.  We had bad luck with Newport<br/>Classic when they sold our recording to Sony...who proceeded to bury it.  The<br/>Ives Universe Symphony recording is now a year late...nothing in the bigger<br/>scheme of things.</p><p>Keep in mind that we are a concert producing organization.  Recordings are<br/>secondary to us.  The more primary they become, the less performing we do.<br/>It is the performing that makes our reputation.  The CD will merely confirm,<br/>not that this is unimportant.  Frankly, it costs money that we as yet do not<br/>have.  But we still have a few surprises.  Hope it helps!.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>p.s.  FYI, Chrisopher misidentified David (not Pat) Glazier).  It was great<br/>reading a review so soon after the last gig.</p></div>
