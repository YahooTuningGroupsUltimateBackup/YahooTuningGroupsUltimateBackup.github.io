You get two and a bit<br/>octaves in a ZTar, with a few notes missing that you can add as duplicates<br/>from 41-equal.  The advantage over Wilson&apos;s schismic mapping for a<br/>hexagonal array is that you don&apos;t need any split keys or temperament.</p><p>I&apos;ve got a ZTar, and tried a tempered version of this mapping on it.  It<br/>was very easy to follow my decimal notation, although it&apos;s not very<br/>guitar-like (because the strings are tuned so close together) so I don&apos;t<br/>know how it&apos;d work with virtuoso playing.  I prefer mappings based on the<br/>strings tuned in neutral thirds for now.  I don&apos;t know if you can get<br/>Partch43 to work like that.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div>
