At that time he was already<br/>experimenting with a razor on the violin to distinguish 16 different<br/>tones within a tone range. At that time Novaro was 2 years of age!!!</p><p>There is no signs of Novaro attempting to use a tuning system<br/>targeting to hear the smallest interval that he could hear, which<br/>was the early idea of Carrillo later on developed into the &apos;Sound 13&apos;<br/>theroy and finally published in 1925.</p><p>Both works are important to what came after and both were ahead<br/>of time. Carrillo had already made a great career as a composer<br/>when he started his own ensemble so he had more credibility<br/>than Novaro but I have no records of Carrillo trying to push Novaro<br/>on the side neither of him supporting his work! ...I will find out,<br/>as well<br/>as I am trying to find out at the moment if Carrillo was in touch with<br/>Harry Partch at some point. I am waiting for some answers from his<br/>relatives who got together last Christmas in Mexico city.</p><p>Sound 13 as Carl already mentioned means breaking with the 12 note<br/>system</p><p>As for the piano 1/16 tone piano from Sauter I am trying to get in<br/>touch with<br/>professor John Mather in Montreal if anybody knows an address. He has<br/>one of the pianos.</p><p>I also know there are other few in France, Germany and Swiss so<br/>now in the process of tracking them down as well as the activities<br/>involved with these pianos.</p><p>As for my work is very tiny at the moment but I have composed for<br/>an ensemble using 96-EDO and built a set of 96 steel conic-shape<br/>bells which are displayed in semicircle using 6 rows of 16 notes<br/>(covering a tone per row)... I named the instrument the conic bellophone<br/>but no patent unless I get a few more orders, otherwise I will<br/>stick to my Chinese contacts to produce it at low cost.</p><p>Shaahim has done work in the 96-EDO, but not sure if people<br/>in this list have work with the this tuning system.</p><p>I hope this helps!</p><p>Tony Salinas</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2008 12:45:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig --</p><p>if I recall correctly, the problem with the Novaro materials has been that his family -- which has (or had) his archives -- was not cooperative with anyone inquiring.
