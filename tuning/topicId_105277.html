There&apos;s a way to change the default constraint,<br/>but I forget what it is, so mine says &quot;0.0000&quot;. That will only detect JI<br/>chords, which clearly isn&apos;t so great for 11 EDO, so let&apos;s change your<br/>constraint.</p><p>Let&apos;s say you want only chords where no interval is more out of tune than<br/>the 5/4 is in 12 EDO: 400.0-386.3=13.69. To the right of the &quot;Constrained&quot;<br/>check box, there&apos;s a button labeled &quot;Change&quot;. Click it, and another dialog<br/>box appears called &quot;User Options&quot;. The top text field is &quot;Maximum<br/>Difference in Cents&quot;, so enter 13.69 in that line. You can also change your<br/>prime limit there if you&apos;re only interested in, say, 13-limit chords. (The<br/>default is 29.) You can also play with the weighting factor, which I won&apos;t<br/>go into -- you can read the help and goof off with it to see what works for<br/>you.</p><p>Anyway, once you&apos;ve set your constraints, click OK in the &quot;User Options&quot;<br/>dialog to get back to the &quot;Show Chord Presence&quot; dialog. You should see that<br/>it says &quot;Maximum difference: 13.6900 cents&quot;.</p><p>Super. Click &quot;OK&quot;, and you&apos;ll see the following on your main Scala window:</p><p>-----<br/>Scale is equal tempered, only showing first degree.<br/> 0-4-12: BP Wide Triad 2nd inversion   7:9:15   diff.  1.280,-10.352<br/> 0-5-9: NM Subfocal Tritonic Seventh   8:11:14   diff. -5.863, 12.992<br/> 0-1-3-4: H&uuml;zzam   5-9-5    diff. -4.117, 10.292, 6.175<br/>Total of 3 with 3 unique<br/>-----</p><p>The first line shows that, because this is an ET, talking about starting on<br/>scale step 1-10 would be redundant. If you had a scale with different step<br/>sizes, it would run through each chord available on each step.</p><p>The second line shows you that scale degrees 0, 4, and 12 approximate a<br/>7:9:15 chord. You can also see that the 4th degree is only 1.28 cents<br/>sharp, but the 12th degree is about 10 cents flat.</p><p>The third line shows you that the scale degrees 0, 5, and 9 approximate an<br/>8:11:14 chord. You can see that the 5th degree is about 6 cents flat, and<br/>the 9th degree is about 13 cents sharp.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what the fourth line means -- I&apos;m sure someone here does,<br/>perhaps Dr. Oz -- but you&apos;re interested in approximations to JI chords, so<br/>I&apos;m not sure whether it matters. The 5-9-5 represents steps of something,<br/>but I don&apos;t know what.</p><p>So there it is: Three unique chords, two of which are the type you appear<br/>to be looking for.</p><p>Two chords isn&apos;t much, so let&apos;s loosen our constraints and see what chords<br/>are available that are less out-of-tune than a 7/4 in 12 EDO: 1000.0 -<br/>968.8 = 31.2 cents. Change the constraints as above, get the following:</p><p>-----<br/> 0-4-7: Isoharmonic Augmented Triad   7:9:11   diff.  1.280,-18.856<br/> 0-4-12: BP Wide Triad 2nd inversion   7:9:15   diff.  1.280,-10.352<br/> 0-5-9: NM Subfocal Tritonic Seventh   8:11:14   diff. -5.863, 12.992<br/> 0-3-6: Isoharmonic Diminished Triad   9:11:13   diff. -20.135, 17.928<br/> 0-3-6-8: Isoharmonic Diminished Seventh   9:11:13:15   diff. -20.135,<br/>17.928,-11.631<br/> 0-5-9: NM Trevicesimal Tritonic Seventh Triple   13:18:23   diff.<br/>-17.928,-5.929<br/> 0-3-6: Diminished   25:30:36   diff.  11.631, 23.263<br/> 0-2-4: Double Septimal Whole-Tone   49:56:64   diff. -12.992,-25.985<br/> 0-3-6: 7-Tone Neutral Triad   2-2   diff. -15.584,-31.169<br/> 0-1-2: Semitone Trichord   1-1   diff.  9.091, 18.182<br/> 0-1-3: Phrygian Trichord   1-2   diff.  9.091, 27.273<br/> 0-2-3: Minor Trichord   2-1   diff.  18.182, 27.273<br/> 0-3-8: Minor Trine 1st inversion   3-6   diff.  27.273,-27.273<br/> 0-3-8-11: Sixths Chord   3-6-3   diff.  27.273,-27.273, 0.000<br/> 0-3-9: Minor Quintal Triad   3-7   diff.  27.273,-18.182<br/> 0-4-6: 13-Tone NM Crunchy Pepper Triple   5-2     diff. -25.175, 8.392<br/> 0-4-11: 13-Tone NM Converse Trine   5-8     diff. -25.175, 0.000<br/> 0-7-11: 13-Tone NM Trine   8-5     diff.  25.175, 0.000<br/> 0-3-6-9: 16-Tone Diminished Seventh   4-5-4   diff.  27.273,-20.455, 6.818<br/> 0-5-9: 17-Tone NM Quasi-Trevicesimal Subfocal Tritonic Seventh   8-6<br/> diff. -19.251,-6.417<br/> 0-2-9: 29-Tone NM Bivalent Ultra-Gothic Triple   6-17     diff. -30.094,<br/>30.094<br/> 0-5-9: 36-Tone NM Smaller Tritone Subfocal Seventh   17-12    diff.<br/>-21.212, 15.152<br/> 0-5-9: 36-Tone NM Larger Tritone Subfocal Seventh   17-13    diff.<br/>-21.212,-18.182<br/> 0-5-9: 46-Tone NM Tritonic Subfocal Seventh   21-16     diff. -2.372,<br/>16.601<br/> 0-1-3-4: H&uuml;zzam   5-9-5    diff. -4.117, 10.292, 6.175<br/>Total of 25 with 25 unique<br/>-----</p><p>Notice that the first eight lines are the same kind of thing that we had<br/>talked about before. More chords are now available, but the additions are<br/>more damaged.</p><p>The next line, &quot;7-Tone Neutral Triad&quot;, says that this sounds a bit like<br/>playing a neutral triad in 7 EDO, and shows the difference from 7 EDO: 11<br/>EDO&apos;s 327-cent interval differs from 7 EDO&apos;s 342-cent interval by about 16<br/>cents. Similarly the 13-, 16-, 17-, 29-, 36-, and 46-Tone lines show you<br/>how similar you are to chords used in other ETs. (Looking at the errors:<br/>Not very.) These lines aren&apos;t about JI, then, but might help you relate one<br/>EDO to another -- &quot;Hey, using 0-5-9 in 11 EDO is like using 0-8-14 in 17<br/>EDO.&quot; (It&apos;s 0-8-14 in 17 EDO because that line says &apos;8-6&apos;, which are the<br/>steps between each tone in the triad.

Not ideal, but good<br/>enough: Thanks, Manuel, I&apos;ll take it. :) )</p><p>Not sure about those guys in the middle: &quot;0-3-8-11: Sixths Chord   3-6-3&quot;<br/>doesn&apos;t mean anything to me. I believe the 3-6-3 again represents steps of<br/>something between tones, but steps of what? I don&apos;t know.</p><p>One thing to remember is that these chords are those that Manuel has<br/>defined and loaded up into Scala. There may be other chords you want to<br/>consider, and this may not give you those.
