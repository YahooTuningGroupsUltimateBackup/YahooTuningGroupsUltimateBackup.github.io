I saw &quot;Re: New Just<br/>&gt;Intonation Neck with Bent Frets&quot; and never got the original. So I checked<br/>&gt;the archives and found this one:</p><p>That&apos;s funny- I think I&apos;ve seen signs of missed messages, and I still get<br/>the list in digest form.</p><p>&gt;You can stop referring to Erlich-CS now, since the other examples of<br/>&gt;improper CS scales came straight from Kraig Grady.).</p><p>Paul, I&apos;m sorry if I implied anything I didn&apos;t mean with this term.  I<br/>didn&apos;t mean to suggest you maliciously made it up, or anything.  I just<br/>don&apos;t think we can afford a single misunderstanding about which CS is meant<br/>when, so to speak.  I&apos;d be happy to switch to CS and Lumma-CS until we get<br/>a definitive answer from the Wilson camp.  Actually, I will do that, since<br/>you&apos;re the one with the original interaction with Kraig on the matter.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
