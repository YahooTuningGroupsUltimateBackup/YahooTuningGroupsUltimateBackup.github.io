One with lines connecting up the cycle of 5ths, one<br/>without.</p><p>The axes are labelled in fractions of a Pythagorean comma. Thus, a M3<br/>with +11/12 Pythagorean comma is 1 syntonic comma sharp. You can<br/>create more general diagrams in cents if you want.</p><p>The diagonal dotted line is where the meantones are situated. Areas to<br/>the West-by-North of the line have positive score according to my<br/>proposal, areas to the East-by-South have negative score. The<br/>motivation should be slightly clearer, as sharp keys mostly lie to the<br/>left and flat keys to the right.</p><p>The minor third can also be seen, less obviously, on the diagrams: the<br/>m3 becomes less pure when you go in the direction Northwest-by-North,<br/>perpendicular to the line C-F on the Young 1 graph. Pure m3 would be<br/>way off the scale to the South.</p><p>Compare A and Ab in Young I: the total abs. error is the same, but I<br/>feel that Ab has slightly less tension about it.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
