I hope everyone here listens to<br/>this<br/>&gt; and learns, because (stylisms aside) you&apos;ve got a whole lot of<br/>&gt; wonderful sound crafting, intonational stuff, rhythmic interest and<br/>&gt; especially the final presentation: great mixing, with lots of<br/>&gt; attention to placement of instruments, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And that from an .mp3 file. Any interest in explaining, in a brief<br/>&gt; manner, the tools you used for this example?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Feh to the people with stock patches. You&apos;re it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon</p><p>Thanks to all who have listened and commented so far. Here&apos;s some of<br/>the technical details:</p><p>Beats:<br/>Used Steinberg&apos;s &quot;Recycle&quot; to chop up my drums clips, then sent them<br/>through SCSI to an old AKAI S3000XL Sampler (a beast that has tested<br/>my sanity). I then use CakeWalk 9.0 to sequence my hand played<br/>rhythms, and to record them as wave files.</p><p>Basslines:<br/>TX802. I love this synth!!! It has some of the meatiest bass<br/>anywhere - even compared with my analog synths.</p><p>Clusters at the beginning and middle:<br/>TX81Z. Got to love that sweet old piece. FM still has many<br/>possibilities!</p><p>Arpeggio:<br/>TX802. I&apos;m in love!!! This was step written in by hand, playing a<br/>descending whole tone scale, which reverses and plays all the other<br/>pitches on the ascent.</p><p>Other synth parts:<br/>TX802, TX81Z. Can you dig it?</p><p>Mixing:<br/>Finished in Sonic Foundry&apos;s Acid, where I used panning and fades to<br/>give space.</p><p>Premastering:<br/>Exported the stereo wave file, and EQ&apos;d and Limited the final mix in<br/>Sound Forge.</p><p>MP3 Encoding:<br/>Xing</p><p>I want to do a serious CD of this style using a variety of tunings<br/>this year. I put out 2 CDs of dance music last year, called<br/>TranceFormations 1&amp;2. Unfortunately, they are in 12 tET, because it<br/>was a collaborative effort with folks who have not embraced the<br/>richness of tunings we all enjoy. This music being in 12, is the<br/>reason I haven&apos;t revealed it here - but all of the pieces are quite<br/>detailed. I&apos;ve thought about stripping out all of the 12 based music,<br/>and replacing it with other tunings - which may be a possibility for<br/>the future - a kind of &quot;Microtonal Remix&quot; if you will. For the<br/>record - I do not plan to do more 12 based music any time in this<br/>immediate life.</p><p>In kindness,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
