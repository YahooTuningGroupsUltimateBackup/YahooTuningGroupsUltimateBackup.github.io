This is to record and crystallize some of my<br/>thoughts and to share with others in the hope of inspiring others&apos; projects<br/>and also to learn some things myself as the result of feedback.  I started<br/>just writing some basic notes and items to keep in mind next time to avoid<br/>pitfalls, but it gradually mutated into a fairly detailed report.  So here<br/>it is!</p><p>For a long time I&apos;d been wanting to make an instrument from metal, and<br/>finally got around to starting something in fall 2000.  I thought<br/>windchimes would be a fun project, and a good way to get my feet wet<br/>without embarking on something too involved yet.  In themselves the<br/>windchimes should be fun to have, but in the back of my mind building these<br/>has been practice for some future microtonal tubulong instrument.  (With so<br/>many time commitments in my real life these days, this may be quite a way<br/>off?)</p><p>MATERIALS<br/>The basic chime materials are 3/4&quot; steel EMT ? electrical conduit.  This is<br/>easily available at the local hardware store, and is cheap!</p><p>THE TUNING<br/>I thought about a few different possible scales and chords (Just and<br/>otherwise) for these chimes.  To my mind, all had merit and I won&apos;t go into<br/>describing my (almost arbitrary) thought processes to make a final<br/>decision.  The final result consists of 9 chimes in a harmonic series chord<br/>with the ratios:<br/>4-5-6-7-9-11-13-15-16</p><p>CUTTING AND TUNING<br/>After looking at some other windchimes, I took a wild stab at desired tube<br/>lengths and decided the shortest tube should be around 30 cm.  Since my<br/>total range is 2 octaves (4/1 ratio), the longest tube would be 60 cm<br/>(length ratio = square root of freq ratio).  Based on 60cm for lowest<br/>pitch, I calculated on a spreadsheet the nominal lengths of each tube.  The<br/>equation for cutting the tube lengths is:</p><p>length / Lo = sqrt( fo/f)</p><p>where length = new tube length<br/>          Lo = known base tube length<br/>          f = new tube frequency<br/>          fo = known frequency of base tube</p><p>You don&apos;t need to know any absolute frequencies to calculate lengths for a<br/>given set of ratios, as long as you don&apos;t care about tuning to some<br/>absolute frequency reference.    I had no specific frequency reference in<br/>mind (e.g. A=440, etc.), since I really didn&apos;t have any idea what<br/>frequencies would result when I cut the tubes to length.  I figured<br/>absolute reference didn&apos;t really matter anyway, since these will probably<br/>not be used in an ensemble setting and have nothing to tonally clash with<br/>(except perhaps the neighbors&apos; windchimes).  By sheer coincidence it turns<br/>out my &quot;9th harmonic&quot; chime is pretty close to standard A.</p><p>Over Labor Day weekend I cut the tubes out of long pieces of conduit using<br/>a hacksaw.  (This actually takes some exertion.  Next time I won&apos;t try to<br/>do this while recovering from minor surgery!)  I also drilled holes at the<br/>node locations for stringing them up.  The nodes are located at<br/>approximately 0.22 of the total length.  I strung up the tubes in my<br/>basement and kept them around for several months while trying to decide how<br/>to mount them and how to go about fine tuning them.  They already sounded<br/>great, and I often got distracted playing with them whenever going<br/>downstairs for some unrelated purpose.  The rough tuning got across the<br/>general chord ok, but I was well aware of some significant mistuning.<br/>Finally in February 2001 I borrowed some equipment ? a microphone, preamp,<br/>and a basic Fluke multimeter with a frequency counter feature.  (A<br/>co-worker once suggested a great sales slogan &quot;If you got a good<br/>measurement it must be a Fluke!&quot;)  This simple setup worked far better than<br/>I had imagined possible.  I was able to get clear, stable frequency<br/>readings in Hertz, lasting for at least a few seconds after striking the<br/>tube.  This particular counter gives frequency to nearest 0.1 Hz.  For my<br/>purposes this should be fine.</p><p>I measured the frequency of all the tubes, and calculated a spreadsheet<br/>showing what corrections needed to be made for each tube.  (Obviously the<br/>corrections are made by filing tubes to raise pitch, since it&apos;s pretty<br/>difficult to lengthen the tubes once they are cut down.)  These first<br/>measurements were done in the lab at work.  The next day I brought the<br/>setup home to continue tuning over the weekend.  Much to my dismay, my<br/>frequency measurements had all increased by anywhere from 0.5 Hz (low end)<br/>to around 2 Hz (high end).  The first measurements had been done at room<br/>temperature of probably 72 degrees F, and the later measurement was after<br/>the tubes had sat in my basement for several hours?approximately 60 F.  I<br/>set all the tubes next to a small electric heater for a couple of minutes<br/>and confirmed that the measurements lowered again.  This surprised me,<br/>since I had read that metal tubes are very stable with regard to frequency<br/>vs temperature and other atmospheric conditions.  Apparently not so, or at<br/>least maybe it depends on the specific materials and quality.  Since the<br/>measurements seemed stable enough without changing temperature, I decided<br/>to proceed at the colder temperature reference.  (Generally the more<br/>prudent choice when living in Minnesota.)  Based on what I have seen, the<br/>frequency drift with temperature seems to happen proportionally with base<br/>frequency of each tube.  So when the 4th harmonic chime drifted 0.5 Hz the<br/>16th harmonic chime drifted 2 Hz.  This is good?at least the chimes should<br/>remain in tune with each other even if they drift together as a whole.</p><p>What I still had not taken into account was the fact that grinding two<br/>pieces of metal together generates heat.  Every time I made a tuning<br/>adjustment by grinding the tube end with a file, the tube heated up.  After<br/>I had fine-tuned every tube (or so I thought) I measured later and found<br/>that every tube had drifted again!  I was very frustrated to discover that<br/>I was shooting at a moving target.  Since some of the tubes were now higher<br/>than their original target frequencies, I recalculated new target<br/>frequencies on a new higher base.  This time I proceeded more carefully,<br/>making smaller adjustments and then leaving the tubes for a long period of<br/>time before measuring frequency.  (Note to self: next time get hold of an<br/>electric grinder?filing by hand is very tedious!)  Finally I got all tubes<br/>within approximately 0.4 Hz (worst case) of target frequency and decided to<br/>&quot;quit while I was ahead&quot;, although I would have preferred to tune all tubes<br/>to within 0.1 Hz if I had the patience and time to keep repeating these<br/>fine tunings over and over!  It appears that all tubes are within 0.6 cents<br/>of target, so I&apos;m content with these results.</p><p>THE WELD<br/>One problematic issue involving musical electrical conduit is the fact that<br/>there is a weld along the length.  You can clearly see the weld when you<br/>look inside the tube.  The weld disrupts the symmetry of the tube and<br/>causes different tone qualities depending on where it is struck.  Some<br/>trial and error is needed to determine the right point(s) around the<br/>circumference to strike the tube to get a clean sound.  At some points you<br/>will get a clear tone, and at other points you will get a slightly wobbly<br/>beating tone.  Ultimately it&apos;s a matter of taste, and the beating may be<br/>inconspicuous or even desirable in some contexts, but my preference for now<br/>is to get the cleanest tone possible.  I generally found the cleanest tone<br/>striking the tube about 60 degrees around circumference from the weld.  I<br/>marked the best striking point with a marker so I would know exactly where<br/>to strike to get the best frequency measurements, and to try to best orient<br/>the chimes when mounting.  Unfortunately I didn&apos;t think this through when I<br/>drilled holes for the hanging strings, so the hole locations are somewhat<br/>haphazard.</p><p>IMPRESSIONS<br/>The chimes have a beautiful sound.  The harmonic series chord works<br/>incredibly well, and creates a very vivid sonic impression.  The longest,<br/>lowest chimes have a wonderful deep tone with good volume and long sustain.<br/>The highest chimes have much shorter sustain and weaker fundamentals.<br/>Generally I would recommend keeping to the longer lengths.  One could go<br/>too far and make the tube so long that the fundamental tone is weaker than<br/>other higher inharmonic partials, but my 60cm tube doesn&apos;t seem to be<br/>pushing at that boundary.</p><p>After fine tuning the tubes the difference tone effects became more vivid.<br/>Since a harmonic series will give combination tones in the same series, one<br/>would expect that the more out of tune the individual members are the more<br/>murky the complex of difference tones would become.  (Even a 1 Hz error<br/>down in the 100 Hz range of periodicity translates to about 20 cents!)<br/>Indeed, the &quot;rough cut&quot; chimes before fine tuning played a reasonably<br/>pleasant chord but did not give a strong unified feeling.  Individual<br/>chimes were off by as much as 20 Hz in the high end (most errors landed<br/>between 10 and 20 cents from target).  As it is now, the differences from<br/>target are at least within 0.4 Hz.  There is certainly a little bit of<br/>error but it&apos;s close enough to clearly bring out the harmonic unity in the<br/>tuning.  When playing the chimes I hear a shimmering droning sound from<br/>&quot;somewhere behind&quot; the chimes.  The composite sound of all the chimes<br/>together seems to fuse into one solid timbre.</p><p>COMMENTS ON TUNING VS. TIMBRE<br/>On the tuning list and in other microtonal writings, one often encounters<br/>discussion of the dreaded &quot;tuning vs. timbre&quot; issue.  Obviously chimes are<br/>struck tubes and have inharmonic partials.  Does a harmonic series tuning<br/>war against the inharmonic timbre?  From reading some people&apos;s theories,<br/>one might expect wretched results.  I admit I was slightly nervous about<br/>how these chimes would sound, and whether the effect of the JI tuning could<br/>really come through with this timbre.  In fact the final results are very<br/>beautiful and striking (no pun intended), and vividly just.</p><p>Even though inharmonic spectra with a JI scale cannot produce the<br/>coinciding partials found when using harmonic series timbres, there are<br/>other effects unique to JI which still come into play.  Mainly these are<br/>combination tones and periodicity.  These are very much in evidence when I<br/>listen to my chimes, particularly up close (i.e. at high volume).  That the<br/>scale of my chimes is one harmonic series chord further reinforces the<br/>sense of periodicity of the whole.</p><p>Also, after the initial attack (a fraction of a second after striking) the<br/>timbre is predominantly a sine tone at the fundamental.  (Of course<br/>depending on where and with what it is struck?)  I looked at the waveform<br/>of individual chimes on an oscilloscope and confirmed that the overall<br/>waveform is a clear sinusoid with &quot;a bit of other small stuff riding on<br/>it&quot;.  So the inharmonic partials may be a bit of a red herring here (at<br/>least in this particular case).  This may also be true for idiophones with<br/>resonators for the fundamental, as others have mentioned before.</p><p>CURRENT STATUS<br/>Currently I still have the chimes strung up on a wire in my basement, and<br/>I&apos;m still playing with them whenever I happen to walk by.  I&apos;ve got some<br/>wood and plexiglass pieces which I plan to cut up for final mounting of the<br/>windchimes.  I&apos;ll arrange them in a circular pattern in such a way that the<br/>weight will distribute more or less evenly, and hang them so that the<br/>striker will line up with the center of each chime.  Hopefully this will be<br/>done before spring has fully sprung.  (As I write this, we&apos;ve still got<br/>about two feet of snow in our yard.)</p><p>FINAL LENGTH AND FREQUENCY TABLE<br/>The following lengths were calculated for the 60 cm base.

The effect on my chimes is much simpler, but<br/>also pretty clear.  I think I do agree with others on the list who have<br/>mentioned that combination tones are ultimately the result of nonlinear<br/>distortion in the ear because of high SPL levels.
