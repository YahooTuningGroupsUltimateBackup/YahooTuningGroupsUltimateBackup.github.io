Also set it up to do your undertone to overtone scales as well, when<br/>I was doing those timbre experiments with them.</p><p>I&apos;ll convert those into javascript for you, perhaps some time over the weekend,<br/>or the start of next week, when I also plan to give myself some time to slowly read<br/>through your recent post and Pierre&apos;s new one too.</p><p>Conversion is fairly easy as javascript is close to c in many ways.</p><p>I don&apos;t yet fully understand your two and three term indexes, mainly because I<br/>just haven&apos;t yet given myself time to read through your posts and think about<br/>them. When I do, will adapt the hypermos generator to make them too.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19361 href="#19361">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2001 1:00:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert,</p><p>&lt;&lt;I also plan to give myself some time to slowly read through your<br/>recent post and Pierre&apos;s new one too.&gt;&gt;</p><p>You&apos;ll need the time for Pierre&apos;s &lt;!&gt;, but mine is remarkably<br/>simple... somewhere along the line I got hung up on the hyper-MOS type<br/>idea and abandoned my own intuition, big mistake!</p><p>In one of the very first posts I put up in response to Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>original question I mentioned the L-out-of-M-out-of-N idea as a likely<br/>answer, and then I never bothered to check it (!), and took off on<br/>down the MOS lookalike route... well that was equal parts fun and<br/>frustrating, and I bounced around some stuff which I at least find<br/>interesting and even useful, but it turned out that my original guess<br/>was actually the answer all along...</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;d be thrilled silly if these were turned into javascript<br/>type calculators, so let me know how I can help!</p><p>thanks,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
