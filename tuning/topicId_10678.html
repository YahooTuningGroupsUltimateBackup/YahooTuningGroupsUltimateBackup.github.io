Hayes mentioned a variant of<br/>it last year (July -August 1999) in an article on &quot;Vibonacci Numbers,&quot; a<br/>form of the Fibonacci series in which the plus sign of the recursion<br/>formula is randomly replaced by either a plus or a minus sign.</p><p>The original reference to the Stern-Brocot tree is Stern, M. A., 1858.<br/>Ueber eine zahlentheoretische Funktion. Journal fuer die reine und<br/>angewandte Mathematik. 55:193-220.

The article also contains a picture of<br/>the reconstructed Antikythera mechanism, a mechanical analog<br/>astronomical computer about 2000 years old and found in sunken ship in<br/>the Mediterranean sea.

For example, one finds scales with 12<br/>tones as the sum of 1+11 and 5+7. (The non-relatively-prime sums,<br/>2+10=12, 3+9=12, and 4+8=12, generate deficient and redundant<br/>solutions, so we can ignore them). This is useful because a given<br/>scale&apos;s appearance in different places on the tree indicates<br/>different -- and often surprisingly so -- ways of working.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Hi Daniel,</p><p>Shouldn&apos;t that say something like &quot;a given number of scale tones will<br/>appear on the tree in every set of sums that have no common divisor<br/>greater than 1&quot;, as opposed to &quot;a given number of scale tones will<br/>appear on the tree in every relatively-prime set of sums&quot;?</p><p>Also, you don&apos;t necessarily have to ignore sums with a common divisor.<br/>You could scale the periodicity by the GCD and go on about the<br/>business of the tree in pretty much the same ways that you mention.<br/>Though you&apos;d have to carry transformations across each segment of your<br/>periodicity, etc.</p><p>By the way, I think posts like the ones your undertaking here are a<br/>great idea and should hopefully spur more participation from a wider<br/>percentage of the list members; especially those who might find a lot<br/>of terminology and ideas flying around between a small group of people<br/>much too quickly to get a grip on.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=24095 href="#24095">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 12:15:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;Shouldn&apos;t that say something like [SNIP]&gt;&gt;</p><p>Whoops, for some reason my brain registered co-prime for<br/>&quot;relatively-prime&quot;, sorry about that.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
