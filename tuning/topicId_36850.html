I<br/>don&apos;t know how he does it.  Many others, including myself, can never<br/>get them to come to *anything.*  Anyway, although perhaps slightly in<br/>breach of copyright, I am submitting the text for educational<br/>purposes to this list.  It&apos;s fairly short this time and, regrettably,<br/>no photo was included:</p><p>INSTRUMENTS AND EARS NEWLY TUNED by Paul Griffiths<br/>NY Times Monday, May 6, 2002:</p><p>The 21st American Festival of Microtonal Music started on Tuesday at<br/>Washington Square United Methodist Church with an unusual program:<br/>rarely do you get Harry Partch and J.S. Bach on the same night.</p><p>Both were being honored for their work with particular tunings:<br/>Partch with just intonation (intervals that represent relatively<br/>simple ratios of frequencies),  Bach with the Werckmeister III tuning<br/>he may have found enshrined in some of the organs he used.  Partch&apos;s<br/>complete &quot;17 Lyrics by Li Po&quot; were intoned by Johnny Reinhard, with<br/>Anastasia Solberg on viola; then a small group of musicians played<br/>the Fourth &quot;Brandenburg&quot; Concerto, a la Werckmeister.</p><p>The Partch score is a classic, his breakthrough piece, written in<br/>1930-33.  But it is almost never performed, surely because the tuning<br/>is so hard to get right, but also because the notation is less than<br/>complete.</p><p>He wrote the instrumental part for an &quot;adapted viola,&quot; a hybrid of<br/>viola and cello, supplied with frets to help the player get the<br/>notes.  Ms. Solberg dispensed with all that.  She played on a<br/>standard viola, tuned down, from her own painstaking transcription of<br/>Partch&apos;s tablature, while Mr. Reinhard, who could have been louder,<br/>rendered the tuneful speech of the vocal part.</p><p>the complete work is long, and maybe on another occasion the<br/>performers could make a selection, which certainly ought to<br/>include &quot;The Night of Sorrow,&quot; a beautiful lament in which voice and<br/>instrument echo in mournful turns through their strange tones, and &quot;I<br/>Am a Peach Tree,&quot; with its flavor of Chinese flamenco.  In the Bach,<br/>the Werckmeister tuning showed up in a slightly skewed sound to ears<br/>expecting equal temperament, but the differences are exceedingly<br/>subtle, never more than a 16th tone, which is less than most<br/>musicians would allow as expressive deviation.</p><p>The concert also included Tristan Murail&apos;s &quot;Winter Fragments,&quot; a<br/>short, delicate essay in electronically modulated instrumental<br/>music.  Consisting of hard-frozen sounds and soft snow showers, it<br/>was played by the Ensemble Subtilior.</p></div>
