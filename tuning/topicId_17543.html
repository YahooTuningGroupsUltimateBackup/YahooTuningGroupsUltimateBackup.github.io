I noticed that you intended to post this message to the list,<br/>but I don&apos;t think it actually made it there, so I thought I&apos;d take<br/>the liberty of posting it for you, so that I may thank you properly<br/>in public as well.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Mary &quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lucid@home.com">lucid@home.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:ligonj@northstate.net">ligonj@northstate.net</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, January 14, 2001 2:48 PM<br/>Subject: For Jacky Ligon (Prime Numbers)</p><p>&gt; I must add that they have an overall sound that is eerily<br/>&gt; &gt; beautiful and uniquely unlike any tunings I&apos;ve ever explored<br/>&gt; &gt; previously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree.  I tried all three of your scales last night with Fractal<br/>&gt; Tune Smithy and found them quite spacious and magnificent.  I<br/>&gt; definately plan on working them into some current compositions.</p><p>And I would like to express my humblest possibly gratitude to you,<br/>for taking interest in the Prime Series Scales. They are lovely<br/>scales, for which I can only take minimal credit in assembling the<br/>wondrous things that the Great Mother provides. The impetus to go to<br/>these high prime places, began for me with reading Partch, but has<br/>been fueled by my awareness of other important theorists and<br/>composers, such as Margo Schulter, Joe Monzo (the silent one) and<br/>many, many others. I also derive boundless inspiration from a<br/>compelling attribute shown by Paul Erlich; that of &quot;always<br/>questioning&quot; even the things most sacred to others (one of which are<br/>folks antique ideas about lower number ratios), in an attempt to find<br/>the paths to truth - which ironically comes in many forms. As long as<br/>I&apos;ve got brothers and sisters of this ilk at my side, I do not walk<br/>alone.</p><p>Years ago, we all might have been happy to hear &quot;hi-fi&quot; music at<br/>22.5k, but we can definitely hear the difference between this and<br/>44.1k - our standard today. None would imagine a return to past<br/>formats giving less quality than we have today. And this is rising<br/>all the time - now we seek resolutions of 96kz and above.  In the<br/>same way, tuning theory must continue toward the goals not yet<br/>discovered, and we just happen to be the frontiersmen and women, out<br/>here on the intonational front, making it happen. This is a noble<br/>place to be - but it isn&apos;t easy.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a lurker on this list. I find mathematics beuatiful but prefer<br/>&gt; spending my time exploring the sonic spaces the numbers open. I<br/>&gt; discovered your Tibetan Tunings several months ago, and have found<br/>&gt; them useful as a combfilter applied to voice.  I encourage you to<br/>&gt; continue exporing your own unique vision.  In truth I find your<br/>&gt; method for generating the scales to make a lot of sense, but I have<br/>&gt; no desire to start any sort of polarization around &quot;the best way&quot;.<br/>I<br/>&gt; just wanted to publically thank you for a very nice gift of new<br/>sonic<br/>&gt; space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MAry<br/>&gt;</p><p>I also find harmony, and an unbelievable expanse of common ground<br/>with you, about the importance of &quot;exploring the sonic spaces the<br/>numbers open&quot;. Theory which is frozen before the point of musical<br/>realization, provides only the initiated with some analytical<br/>enjoyment, but when it is given living and breathing existence<br/>in the form of actual music, then all may benefit from the final<br/>product.</p><p>I&apos;m more than a little delighted to hear that you found value in my<br/>exercise of measuring the Gyaling. I love Tibetan music and culture,<br/>and have had an intimate affinity for Buddhism since age 16.</p><p>Now this is very interesting that you have applied this to a comb-<br/>filter! I love comb-filtering!!! I have DX and VST plugins that will<br/>do this, but I&apos;m not sure how I can apply a tuning to it. Would you<br/>be so kind as to share how you do this?</p><p>I really appreciate your encouragement in the search of the Prime<br/>Series, and other unique visions, as I&apos;m sure many other JI/RI<br/>composers and theorists will be. Many times it&apos;s difficult to gauge<br/>reactions in the medium of text, but you have made it clear to me<br/>that there are many list members out there - no matter to what degree<br/>they lurk - who find resonance and usefulness in RI/JI concepts.</p><p>In upcoming weeks I will reveal some other very compelling attributes<br/>of the Prime Series. I would like to wait for this to synchronize<br/>with the return of Dave Keenan from vacation, since questions I have,<br/>concern certain of his theoretical concepts. Should be fun and<br/>interesting!</p><p>Thanks kindly to you Mary,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=17547 href="#17547">ðŸ”—</a>Mary &#x3C;lucid@home.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2001 5:50:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; Mary,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello!

I<br/>really like the Granular Synthesis plugin - Pitch Accumen - I think<br/>it&apos;s called (I&apos;m not at the studio now). The whole set is great<br/>though. I most commonly will use these in WaveLab, using the Master<br/>Section; I haven&apos;t tried them in Cubase yet, but I&apos;ll bet it&apos;s<br/>fantastic to apply them in real time to the music.</p><p>Can you not &quot;animate&quot; and record movements and gestures with the TDM<br/>plugin format? Seems this would be an exciting capability.</p><p>Thanks for the tip about using the tuning with the comb-filter. I&apos;ll<br/>have to give this a try real soon.</p><p>&gt; Likewise, have been to Tibet and done many Sakya initiations. That<br/>&gt; is why they caught my attention.<br/>&gt; Mary</p><p>Mary,</p><p>You spoke about using the comb-filtering on voice. Was this a singing<br/>or spoken voice? I am most interested in the art of singing in<br/>deliberate microtonal scales. If you have any MP3s or CDs out, I<br/>would personally be very interested to hear some of your music. I&apos;m<br/>finding that microtonal singing can be one of the most lovely<br/>realizations of the tunings.</p><p>Could you speak about your use of voice in your music? If you are<br/>singing in deliberate microtonal scales, in what ways does the<br/>computer, midi and hard-disk recording help you to realize your vocal<br/>pieces? This is of huge interest to me.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=17600 href="#17600">ðŸ”—</a>Mary &#x3C;lucid@home.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2001 9:55:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Hi Jackie</p><p>You spoke about using the comb-filtering on voice.

I love it because it makes it so easy to<br/>experiment with different tunings.  Often times I just leave it<br/>running in the background.  When I hear something I really like I<br/>record it, and then wait for a piece to evolve where I can use it.<br/>Journeying is pretty much straight from FTS.<br/>One reason I got so excited about your scales was I could hear a lot<br/>of new compositions coming forth from them.
