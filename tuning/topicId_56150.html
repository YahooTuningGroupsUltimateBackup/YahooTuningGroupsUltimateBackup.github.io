I don&apos;t have<br/>a reference, though; I only recall reading it somewhere.<br/>I have the book &quot;Oliver Heaviside&quot; by Paul Nahin, but I<br/>checked the index and it doesn&apos;t have anything.</p><p>My impression is that his notation wouldn&apos;t be microtonal, just<br/>a different way of writing standard piano music, but I&apos;m guessing.</p><p>[My interest at the moment is in finding a &quot;mathematical&quot; kind<br/>of notation for writing some music of J.S. Bach. For example,<br/>he states a characteristic pattern in the first measure, and then<br/>through out the whole prelude the pattern is being inverted,<br/>transposed to different keys, etc. I would like to be able to<br/>express these transformations simply and concisely, and I was<br/>wondering if maybe what Heaviside did would be of any use in that<br/>regard...]</p><p>--Jeff</p></div><h3>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@superluminal.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2004 3:39:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very interesting!
