The chord would then be voiced as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8:11:14:20:26:36. I came up with four interpretations of my own, two in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 11-limit, two in 7-limit. The first, third and fourth use 27/8 instead<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of 13/4, because I see the 13th harmonic as much more minor than major.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The last two treat the first four notes as an altered French sixth (i.e.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; C F# A# E) and use more &quot;orthodox&quot; ratios equating to 26/53 or 35/72 of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an octave.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * 8:11:14:20:27:36<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * 24:33:42:60:80:108 (replacing 27/8 with 10/3)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * 32:45:56:80:108:144 (if the tritone is 45/32)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * 40:56:70:100:135:180 (if the tritone is 7/5)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still need to familiarize myself better with Prometheus though.

Reason for using flat 7th (when we start on C) is that this chord was originally constructed as a Dominant class chord, later such complex chords were used on other tones in a scale.<br/>Of course a chord which follows harmonic series would be rather 13/11+, that one started to be used by Debussy, Scriabin and later overused in jazz even as ending chord. It&apos;s based on the Lydian/Mixolydian scale C - D - E - F# - G - A - Bb, which has a narrow connection with flute overblowing (and Scriabin&apos;s Prometheus chord!). Therefore we can find this scale in all cultures using flute as a main instrument, usually shepherd&apos;s music, in Europe it&apos;s for example Carpathian music from Bulgaria to Slovakia, South Poland and eastern Moravia where this type of musical culture ends (which was found and used by many composers - Bartok, Janacek especially, Haba, Killar - his Krzesany is an excellent example for this scale...). This &quot;natural harmonic&quot; scale has a name &quot;goralska&quot; or &quot;podhalanska&quot; tonality in High Tatra Mountains and it can be easily played on regional instrument - long flute called &quot;fujara&quot; and other flutes.</p><p>Long time composers were not aware of this, but when accordics has reached 13th in the middle of 19th century, and when composers started to be interested in folklore and were influenced by it, there were some composers who started not to use 13th chord in a traditional way (e.g. with omitted third and fifth, like for example Bb7maj on C bass - such chords were used by Chopin and Liszt), but with 11+, third and fifth to simulate harmonic series even in common 12 ET. It&apos;s interesting but not surprising that composers-pianists started with this, as they could find such &quot;nice sounding&quot; chords easily with pressed pedal. We can find such chords in Chopin, Liszt (maybe not intentional use, just as a color) and especially Debussy who was for sure aware of this.  Chopin used 7th and 9th chords in this way. Debussy has this in his Isle joyeuse (BTW I consider it as a great breakthrough work, there&apos;s a clear connection to harmonic series with Lydian 4th and Mixolydian 7th, it would sound great in JI) and other works. This line in music continued in Stravinskij, Janacek, Bartok, Messiaen, Killar, Reich and many others (not forget myself in more works).</p><p>But it&apos;s necessary to emphasize that it&apos;s only a simulation of harmonic series.

Very soon he started with more complex chords and alterations, which lead him to whole tone scale and augmented chords on one side (Debussy&apos;s influence?), and diminished chord and diminished mode on the other side (Chopin, Liszt). Whole tone scale as well as diminished chord and diminished scale has lot of tritones (he loved this interval, maybe because of that numerological symbol - it has 6 halftones, and it was always called &quot;diabolus in musica&quot;, so he used it a lot in his works, like Satanic Poem, Black Mess sonata etc). It&apos;s not so far from the idea of using fourths as a base for chords (same was discovered by Satie, later Debussy - probably derived from pentatonics, later Schoenberg). In his last pieces he was not far from atonality, but differently then Schoenberg.</p><p>What&apos;s fabion bowers?

In many cases, there are lots<br/>&gt; of chords like &quot;C#-F-B-E-A-D-G&quot; with the C# being &quot;doubled&quot; in some lower<br/>&gt; octaves. And in some cases, particularly in the &quot;Sextet&quot;, when this chord is<br/>&gt; used repeatedly to accompany other melodic voices, those melodic voices are<br/>&gt; sometimes constrained to an ordinary pentatonic scale which excludes the<br/>&gt; bass tone (like G-A-B-D-E). This means that the chord starts, counting from<br/>&gt; the lowest tone, with the diminished fourth followed by an augmented fourth<br/>&gt; (and even Scriabins Prometheus itself contains lots of these instances of<br/>&gt; the chord). When you play this thing in 12-equal, the diminished fourth has<br/>&gt; such a &quot;tendency&quot; to be used like a major third that you would immediately<br/>&gt; find the chord &quot;out of tune&quot; if you tried to tune this interval to a<br/>&gt; diminished fourth in, say, 5-limit JI. The only suggestion I can think of at<br/>&gt; the moment (should we really use JI) is to use 3-limit Pythagorean<br/>&gt; intonation. But again, a Pythag. dim. fourth is only about 2 cents away from<br/>&gt; a pure major third so I&apos;m asking what&apos;s the point if real Pythag. major<br/>&gt; thirds don&apos;t sound so &quot;synchronous&quot; as dim. fourths.

In many cases,<br/>&gt; there are lots of chords like &quot;C#-F-B-E-A-D-G&quot; with the C# being<br/>&gt; &quot;doubled&quot; in some lower octaves. And in some cases, particularly in<br/>&gt; the &quot;Sextet&quot;, when this chord is used repeatedly to accompany other<br/>&gt; melodic voices, those melodic voices are sometimes constrained to an<br/>&gt; ordinary pentatonic scale which excludes the bass tone (like<br/>&gt; G-A-B-D-E). This means that the chord starts, counting from the lowest<br/>&gt; tone, with the diminished fourth followed by an augmented fourth (and<br/>&gt; even Scriabins Prometheus itself contains lots of these instances of<br/>&gt; the chord). When you play this thing in 12-equal, the diminished<br/>&gt; fourth has such a &quot;tendency&quot; to be used like a major third that you<br/>&gt; would immediately find the chord &quot;out of tune&quot; if you tried to tune<br/>&gt; this interval to a diminished fourth in, say, 5-limit JI. The only<br/>&gt; suggestion I can think of at the moment (should we really use JI) is<br/>&gt; to use 3-limit Pythagorean intonation. But again, a Pythag. dim.<br/>&gt; fourth is only about 2 cents away from a pure major third so I&apos;m<br/>&gt; asking what&apos;s the point if real Pythag. major thirds don&apos;t sound so<br/>&gt; &quot;synchronous&quot; as dim. fourths. And anyway, the Pythag. F-B is much<br/>&gt; closer to 10/7 rather than 7/5, so the 7th won&apos;t work either.</p><p>Thanks for the recommendation; I&apos;ve never heard Steve Reich&apos;s music<br/>until now.

In Jazz we call it the<br/>7(b5), not the 7(#11) because it is at the expense of the fifth<br/>whereas #11 appears with the maj 7 and still uncludes the fifth an<br/>octave below. 7(b5) is one of the standard altered chords and, like<br/>dim, is identical to the 7(b5) a flat-fifth away. This is handy<br/>because we can substitute the five-one progression with b2-one so<br/>that cycling becomes chromatic. On the other hand, #11 belongs to the<br/>one maj chord group (lydian).</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=80701 href="#80701">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2009 6:44:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another specific feature of 12-et is that it&apos;s allways out of<br/>tune, and<br/>&gt; &gt; every interval sounds thesame, and it puts a boring gray haze<br/>over all music<br/>&gt; &gt; played in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First off, your reasoning is circular. It&apos;s out of tune relative to<br/>&gt; the chord you specified above. It&apos;s perfectly &quot;in tune&quot; if that&apos;s<br/>what<br/>&gt; it&apos;s meant to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fact that 4 equal divisions of the octave produces a dim7 that<br/>&gt; sounds identical in all keys is a feature, not a bug. The fact that<br/>&gt; you label it to be a malformation of 12-tet doesn&apos;t take away from<br/>its<br/>&gt; practicality. In this case, the fact that it is completely ambiguous<br/>&gt; and could resolve any which way is a property that has been<br/>exploited<br/>&gt; for years.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anything done in 12-et with the dim7 that sounds musical you can<br/>do in JI<br/>&gt; &gt; better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Except sound the same in every inversion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That it doesn&apos;t sound exactly thesame in all keys is a good thing<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t take away musical possibilities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It takes away the possibility of having an unexpected resolution to<br/>a<br/>&gt; different chord than you would expect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are chords out there that have nothing to do with JI. Go look<br/>up<br/>&gt; some of the recent discussions on metastable ratios, for example.<br/>Such<br/>&gt; chords aren&apos;t against the law.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>Mike&apos;s absolutely right about this. Dim chords are not &apos;out-of-tune&apos;<br/>but represent one of THE most important discoveries in all of musical<br/>harmony. For whatever tuning system you might wish to adopt, octave<br/>equivalence will always exist outside as a fact of nature and the<br/>diminished 5 (tritone) is the ONLY interval which is the square root<br/>of 2 i.e. when multiplied by itself gives the octave. That 1: sqr2 =<br/>sqr2: 2 shows that both notes share precisely the same harmonic<br/>function simultaneously (a C and F# will be both 1 and sqr2 at the<br/>same time) so that it is impossible to determine the tonic.<br/>Similarly, the dim chord is the only 4 note chord which is the 4th<br/>root of 2, the augmented the only triad, etc...These symmetries<br/>supply us with harmonic ambiguities which allow us to modulate<br/>smoothly. If we lower each note in a dim chord by a semitone we get a<br/>dom 7 chord, each one a min 3rd apart. So if we replace any dom 7<br/>chord with a diminished a semitone above we can come out in any key a<br/>min 3rd, b5 or maj 6 away. Most common is resolving to relative maj<br/>from min or vice-versa eg G# dim = G7(b9) = E7(b9) groups, so we can<br/>resolve to both C maj or A min. J.S. Bach uses this all the time. So<br/>do Jazz musicians.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=80710 href="#80710">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2009 8:29:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel: Why do you insist that the only valid harmonies are 5-limit ones?</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sat, Feb 7, 2009 at 3:30 PM, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re playing something like C E G Bb D F# A in actual tonal music<br/>&gt; you&apos;re most likely playing something like<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5 9/8 45/32 27/16<br/>&gt; and not 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 9/4 11/4 13/4<br/>&gt; sure the harmonic overtone version will sound ok played by itself as they&apos;re<br/>&gt; harmonic overtones played as such.<br/>&gt; But it would have no musical function.
