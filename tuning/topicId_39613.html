Let us<br/>first consider</p><p>                    1200 &lt;12,6&gt; (700, 16.667)</p><p>This Cartesian tuning, based on a 1200-cent octave, would consist of<br/>12-note chains or rows, with six such chains; a 700-cent generator<br/>(7/12 octave) for each chain; and a distance of 16.667 cents (or 1/72<br/>octave) between chains.</p><p>In other words, we have a regularized 72-EDO keyboard using six<br/>12-note manuals (Halberstadt, Janko, or whatever) at 1/12-tone apart.</p><p>A different kind of Cartesian tuning I find quite attractive is this:</p><p>                    1200 &lt;17,2&gt; &lt;705.882, 55.106)</p><p>Here, with the interval of equivalence again a 2:1 octave, we have<br/>chains of 17 notes, with two such chains; a generator of 705.882 cents<br/>(10/17 octave) for each chain; and a distance of 55.106 cents between<br/>chains.</p><p>This tuning consists of two complete 17-EDO circles at the distance of<br/>55.106 cents, the difference between a regular 17-EDO whole-tone at<br/>3/17 octave (~211.765 cents) and a pure 7:6.</p><p>Such a Cartesian tuning would map neatly, for example, to a<br/>regularized keyboard consisting of two 17-note manuals, each with five<br/>flats and five sharps.</p><p>In the special case where each chain or row forms a closed circle or<br/>approximately closed &quot;loop&quot; in itself, we have a &quot;bike chain&quot; tuning<br/>or the like. Either of our last two examples illustrate such a<br/>system: the first defines a complete 72-EDO tuning, while the second<br/>consists of two complete 17-EDO circles but does not itself define a<br/>closed tuning.</p><p>An example of an &quot;approximate bike chain&quot; tuning would be:</p><p>                    1200 &lt;31,2&gt; (697.578, 5.377)</p><p>This system consists of two 31-note chains or &quot;loops&quot; of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone at 1/4 syntonic comma apart -- basically Vicentino&apos;s likely<br/>system of adaptive just intonation (factors of 2-3-5).</p><p>This is an &quot;approximate bike chain&quot; because a 31-note meantone chain<br/>is approximately or musically rather than precisely or mathematically<br/>closed: 31 meantone fifths fall short of 18 pure octaves by about 6.07<br/>cents, so that &quot;closure&quot; is a choice rather than a mathematical<br/>necessity.</p><p>While the examples above all involve temperament, it is also quite<br/>possible to have Cartesian just or rational tunings for example:</p><p>                       2:1 &lt;12,2&gt; (3:2, 64:63)</p><p>This system has two 12-note Pythagorean chains at a 64:63 (~27.26<br/>cents) apart, yielding some pure ratios of 2-3-7-9 such as<br/>12:14:18:21.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
