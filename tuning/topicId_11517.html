Chapman &#x3C;christopher.chapman@conexant.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2000 9:01:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul Erlich, TD 740.5]:<br/>&gt;Certainly the &quot;neutral third&quot; is found in many forms -- in Persian and<br/>&gt;Byzantine music, often around 367 cents. Remember, these musics are<br/>&gt;melodic, not harmonic, so the field of attraction of nearby simple<br/>&gt;ratios is not really an issue.</p><p>OK, first a disclaimer: the easiest way to get two Persian music<br/>theorists in an argument is to ask them what the actual intervals<br/>of Persian music are.  :-)</p><p>That said, IMHO as a student of Persian classical music, my observation<br/>has been that the neutral intervals tend to be closer to the minor<br/>intervals than to the major intervals.  367 cents sounds too close to<br/>the major third to me.  Actually, even the 24 tET neutral third of 350<br/>cents sounds too sharp to me.  :-)</p><p>I think one of the things that does strongly influence the placement of<br/>frets for Persian music is that in the course of playing a Dastgah one<br/>modulates through many subsidiary Gusheh-ha by changing tonics.  So, the<br/>ability to change keys is a major factor.  I think it was partly for<br/>this reason that Vaziri was such a big fan of 24 tET -- since then one<br/>can change to any key and still play all the intervals consistently. The<br/>other two groups of fixed tunings that seem to be popular are tunings<br/>built up of fifths (as promoted by theorists such as Barkechli) or of<br/>fifths and thirds (based on observations by Farhat, et al).</p><p>Despite the above, most of what I have heard and read from Persian<br/>musicians (as opposed to Persian music theorists) is that the ideal<br/>intervals for all the Gusheh-ha of all the Dastgah-ha can not be reduced<br/>to a fixed set, which is why there are moveable gut frets on those<br/>Persian lutes which are not fretless.  The musicians adjust their frets<br/>depending on the sequence of Gusheh-ha they are about to play.</p><p>A note about the following notation:<br/>   Ep is &quot;E koron&quot;<br/>   F&gt; is &quot;F sori&quot;</p><p>This is an ASCII-ified version of the symbols Vaziri introduced to allow<br/>Persian classical music to be written in western classical notation.</p><p>Barkechli&apos;s Persian scale is basically a 17-tone Pythagorean scale<br/>(this is from PYTH_17.SCL from Scala):</p><p>  0:      1/1          0.000 cents  C   unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:    256/243       90.225 cents  Db  Pythagorean limma<br/>  2:   2187/2048     113.685 cents  Db  apotome<br/>  3:      9/8        203.910 cents  D   major whole tone<br/>  4:     32/27       294.135 cents  Eb  Pythagorean minor third<br/>  5:  19683/16384    317.595 cents  Ep  Pythagorean augmented second<br/>  6:     81/64       407.820 cents  E   Pythagorean major third<br/>  7:      4/3        498.045 cents  F   perfect fourth<br/>  8:   1024/729      588.270 cents  F&gt;  Pythagorean diminished fifth<br/>  9:    729/512      611.730 cents  Gp  Pythagorean tritone<br/> 10:      3/2        701.955 cents  G   perfect fifth<br/> 11:    128/81       792.180 cents  Ab  Pythagorean minor sixth<br/> 12:   6561/4096     815.640 cents  Ab  Pythagorean augmented fifth<br/> 13:     27/16       905.865 cents  A   Pythagorean major sixth<br/> 14:     16/9        996.090 cents  Bb  Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 15:  59049/32768   1019.550 cents  Bp  Pythagorean augmented sixth<br/> 16:    243/128     1109.775 cents  B   Pythagorean major seventh<br/> 17:      2/1       1200.000 cents  C   octave</p><p>Farhat, in his doctoral thesis, gives the following as the average of<br/>several observed tar and sehtar tunings:</p><p> 0:          1/1           C<br/> 1:         90.000 cents   Db<br/> 2:        135.000 cents   Dp<br/> 3:        205.000 cents   D<br/> 4:        295.000 cents   Eb<br/> 5:        340.000 cents   Ep<br/> 6:        410.000 cents   E<br/> 7:        500.000 cents   F<br/> 8:        565.000 cents   F&gt;<br/> 9:        630.000 cents   Gp<br/>10:        700.000 cents   G<br/>11:        790.000 cents   Ab<br/>12:        835.000 cents   Ap<br/>13:        905.000 cents   A<br/>14:        995.000 cents   Bb<br/>15:       1040.000 cents   Bp<br/>16:       1110.000 cents   B<br/>17:       1200.000 cents   C</p><p>The following (PERSIAN.SCL from Scala) is similar to Farhat&apos;s<br/>observed tuning and is built up of fifths and thirds:</p><p>Persian Tar Scale, from Dariush Anooshfar, Internet Tuning List 2/10/94<br/>  0:    1/1       0.000 cents  C   unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:  256/243    90.225 cents  Db  Pythagorean limma<br/>  2:   27/25    133.238 cents  Dp  large limma<br/>  3:    9/8     203.910 cents  D   major whole tone<br/>  4:   32/27    294.135 cents  Eb  Pythagorean minor third<br/>  5:  243/200   337.148 cents  Ep  acute minor third<br/>  6:   81/64    407.820 cents  E   Pythagorean major third<br/>  7:    4/3     498.045 cents  F   perfect fourth<br/>  8:   25/18    568.717 cents  F&gt;  classic augmented fourth<br/>  9:   36/25    631.283 cents  Gp  classic diminished fifth<br/> 10:    3/2     701.955 cents  G   perfect fifth<br/> 11:  128/81    792.180 cents  Ab  Pythagorean minor sixth<br/> 12:   81/50    835.193 cents  Ap  acute minor sixth<br/> 13:   27/16    905.865 cents  A   Pythagorean major sixth<br/> 14:   16/9     996.090 cents  Bb  Pythagorean minor seventh<br/> 15:  729/400  1039.103 cents  Bp  acute minor seventh<br/> 16:  243/128  1109.775 cents  B   Pythagorean major seventh<br/> 17:    2/1    1200.000 cents  C   octave</p><p>Vaziri&apos;s scale is just a subset of 24 tET:</p><p>  0:          1/1           C<br/>  1:        100.000 cents   Db<br/>  2:        150.000 cents   Dp<br/>  3:        200.000 cents   D<br/>  4:        300.000 cents   Eb<br/>  5:        350.000 cents   Ep<br/>  6:        400.000 cents   E<br/>  7:        500.000 cents   F<br/>  8:        550.000 cents   F&gt;<br/>  9:        650.000 cents   Gp<br/> 10:        700.000 cents   G<br/> 11:        800.000 cents   Ab<br/> 12:        850.000 cents   Ap<br/> 13:        900.000 cents   A<br/> 14:       1000.000 cents   Bb<br/> 15:       1050.000 cents   Bp<br/> 16:       1100.000 cents   B<br/> 17:          2/1           C</p><p>I believe Vaziri actually had more than 17 frets per octave on his tar,<br/>but I can not remember if he had all 24 frets per octave or a subset<br/>that was 17 &lt; n &lt; 24.

I&apos;m curious if you may<br/>be able to answer the below question that I posted in message 11442:</p><p>From:   &lt;jacky_ekstasis@y...&gt;<br/>Date: Fri Aug 11, 2000 4:59pm<br/>Subject: Another Maqam Question</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&quot;We had some debate about this here on the list, and there&apos;s really<br/>too much<br/>variety between different parts of the Arabic world, and too much<br/>divergence<br/>between theory and practice, for there to be one definitive answer to<br/>your<br/>question. As I see it, all kinds of creative deviations from the<br/>modern<br/>standard 24-tET can be justified on theoretical and/or cultural<br/>grounds, but<br/>I wouldn&apos;t automatically stuff everything into the nearest just ratios<br/>unless I were going to make a significant use of harmony (which is<br/>rare in<br/>Arabic music). If I were, I&apos;d make sure the ratios provided for simple<br/>proportions in the intervals to be used as harmonies (rather than<br/>worrying<br/>about whether they looked simple on their own), and didn&apos;t run into<br/>any<br/>comma difficulties (such as the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth between 9/8 and 5/3 if I<br/>planned to use the D-A harmony in the C major &quot;just&quot; scale).<br/>Otherwise, I&apos;d<br/>see no real reason to choose just ratios over 24-tET, though in many<br/>cases<br/>(11/9, 3/2, etc.), it wouldn&apos;t make an audible difference.&quot;</p><p>Paul,</p><p>I will keep your suggestions in mind as I work with the scales.</p><p>I entered all of the Arabic scales into my spread sheet so that I<br/>could see them as cents scales. I found that one of the scales had a<br/>sequence that exceeded 1200 cents. It was the 3 1 2 1 4 4 2 4 4 Maqam<br/>Jabburi, which added up to be 150, 200, 300, 350, 550, 750, 850,<br/>1050, 1250 cents. Is this correct for this scale? All the others<br/>terminated on 1200 cents.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky</p></div><h3><a id=11600 href="#11600">ðŸ”—</a>MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL</h3><span>8/18/2000 7:47:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; 3 1 2 1 4 4 2 4 4 is exactly how it appears in Manuel&apos;s table.
