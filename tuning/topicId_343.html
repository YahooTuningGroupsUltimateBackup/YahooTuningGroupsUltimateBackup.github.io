This grew out of an attempt to<br/>achieve a &#xFFFD;utilitarian&#xFFFD; all purpose pitch continuum reference and notation<br/>that required learning one (learnable) main set of multipurpose symbols&#xFFFD; The<br/>problems with this are that most any densely voiced single staff writing can<br/>quickly become a rather daunting thicket of &#xFFFD;data&#xFFFD; - But again, I don&#xFFFD;t<br/>believe that fixed pitch instruments need to trouble themselves with this<br/>kind of notation&#xFFFD; The other problem is that while I find it very easy to<br/>memorize one main set of three symbols - Learning to navigate (approximate)<br/>eight and a third cent alterations of eighth tones is quite another matter!</p><p>**If one assumes that any such process is largely a &#xFFFD;utility&#xFFFD; of recasting<br/>the heptad&#xFFFD; There would seem to be two &#xFFFD;ideals&#xFFFD; achievable by addressing<br/>fifth size (that also accommodate both an internally consistent fidelity to<br/>the procedure of equally dividing the octave _and_ the &#xFFFD;third friendly&#xFFFD;<br/>constitution of quarter comma meantone or five limit just intonation). The<br/>first would involve recasting n-&quot;d&quot; in an approximation of quarter comma<br/>meantone. This could be done by recasting &quot;O&quot; as 31, &quot;F&quot; as 18, and &quot;f&quot; as<br/>13. Then d &#xFFFD; O &#xFFFD; F = the &quot;d&quot; approximation of a quarter comma meantone<br/>fifth. The second would involve a variant of the same process&#xFFFD; If &quot;O&quot; = 31<br/>and &quot;d&quot; = 53; 53 is recast in 31, thus allowing &quot;O&quot; to = 53 but &quot;F&quot; to =<br/>30.24/31 (and therefore &quot;f&quot; to = 22.7/31), and functionally recasting n-&quot;d&quot;<br/>in an approximation of five limit just intonation.</p><p>***If 22tET is recast in five limit just intonation @:</p><p>               C<br/>-----------------------------<br/>F 9                      G 13<br/>Bb 18                 D 4<br/>Eb 6                   A 16<br/>Ab 15                 E 7<br/>Db 2                   B 20<br/>Gb 11                 F# 11<br/>Cb 21                 C# 1<br/>Fb 8                   G# 14<br/>Bbb 17               D# 5<br/>Ebb 4                 A# 18<br/>Abb 13               E# 9<br/>Dbb 1                 B# 21<br/>Gbb 10               Fx 12<br/>Cbb 19              Cx 3<br/>Fbb 6                 Gx 16<br/>Bbbb 16             Dx 6</p><p>D = Ebb... but not CX, F = E#... but not Gbb etc., etc., But as the whole<br/>idea is to circumnavigate an Eb that is Fbb and DX and yet is not DX, E, or<br/>Fb (!)&#xFFFD; A major scale in any key (of any utilitarian n-tET) that maintains<br/>both a consistent (having nothing to do with symmetric) array of diatonic<br/>seconds and consecutive note spelling would seem to at least be a desirable<br/>line of inquiry?</p><p>****Recasting 16 tET in quarter comma meantone would necessitate the<br/>following alterations:</p><p> (Db) 0 [2] 5 [6] 9 [11] 14 16<br/> (D) 0 [2] 5 [6] 9 [11] 14 16<br/> (Eb) 0 3 5 7 9 12 [15] 16<br/> (E) 0 3 5 7 9 12 [15] 16<br/> (Fb) 0 [2] 5 [6] 9 12 14 16<br/> (F) 0 [2] 5 [6] 9 12 14 16<br/> (F#) 0 [2] 5 [6] 9 12 14 16/(Gb) 0 3 5 7 [10] 12 [15] 16<br/> (G) 0 3 5 7 [10] 12 [15] 16<br/> (G#) 0 3 5 7 [10] 12 [15] 16<br/> (Ab) 0 [2] 5 7 9 12 14 16<br/> (A) 0 [2] 5 7 9 12 14 16<br/> (Bb) 0 3 [6] 7 [10] 12 [15] 16<br/> (B) 0 3 [6] 7 [10] 12 [15] 16</p><p>*****However when the equidistant division of the octave is large enough<br/>that &quot;appropriately altering the sequence&quot; exceeds the tuning unit (1/n of<br/>an octave), the &#xFFFD; glyph would have to indicate this&#xFFFD;</p></div>
