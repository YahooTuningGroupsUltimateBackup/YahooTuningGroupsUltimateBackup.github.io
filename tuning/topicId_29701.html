The first letter is<br/>not capitalised (unless at the start of a sentence, which should be<br/>avoided) and the singular does not have an &quot;s&quot; on the end.</p><p>Why? The man&apos;s name is George Secor, not George Secors. And a Secor is<br/>a human, a member of his family, while a secor is the interval. This<br/>is like James Watt of steam engine fame and the unit of power named<br/>after him which is the watt. This is the standard for all units of<br/>measurement named after people (except the &quot;degree Celsius&quot;).</p><p>1 secor<br/>2 secors<br/>3 secors</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
