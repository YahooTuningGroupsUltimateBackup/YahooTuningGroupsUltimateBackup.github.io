As I write in my book:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/book/book.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/book/book.htm</a></p><p>&gt; Claudius Ptolemais ... was interested in synchronizing<br/>&gt; the two disparate schools of thought in ancient Greek<br/>&gt; music theory: the Pythagorean, which believed that<br/>&gt; everything harmonious was due to numerical relationships<br/>&gt; (but which was close-minded in that it only accepted<br/>&gt; powers of 3), and the Aristoxenean, which eschewed numbers<br/>&gt; completely,but which also based consonance on the faculty<br/>&gt; of the ear to recognize &quot;smooth&quot; sounds, which we know<br/>&gt; are the result of small-number relationships.</p><p>I&apos;m sure that I&apos;ll eventually rewrite that last bit, because<br/>we recognize  as consonant many intervals which are *not*<br/>small-number ratios, but the small-number ratios still<br/>provide at least a rough guidepost to what we perceive as<br/>the basic consonant intervallic _gestalts_; see Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>&quot;On Harmonic Entropy&quot;:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm</a></p><p>Again from my book:</p><p>&gt; Ptolemy&apos;s achievement was to recognize relationships<br/>&gt; of the smallest prime numbers which were compatible<br/>&gt; with the required asesthetic effect for any given<br/>&gt; musical system.</p><p>(Hmmm... I didn&apos;t cite Partch here, but I know that this<br/>is pretty much a quote from _Genesis of a Music_.  In any<br/>case, Partch clearly expressed that this was precisely the<br/>reason for his admiration of Ptolemy.)</p><p>Ptolemy was indeed a strong supporter of using 5 as a<br/>factor in measuring the &quot;Tense Diatonic&quot; genus on the<br/>monochord (the &quot;Ptolemaic Sequence&quot; of which Partch<br/>speaks so fondly, and which, after Zarlino&apos;s and Lippius&apos;s<br/>advocacy, became the foundation of harmonic theory in<br/>Europe after c. 1550).</p><p>So yes, when Ptolemy needed to find a small-number ratio<br/>which split the 6:5 in half arithmetically, 11 would do<br/>the trick.  But note that he felt the need to find that<br/>ratio *because* dozens of different notes, closely related<br/>in pitch-height, which gave a certain audible effect which<br/>we generally associate with 11-limit ratios, *were already<br/>being used in practice*.</p><p>The historical situation is not quite as simple as Partch<br/>makes it look in his graph &quot;Diagram 3 - Chronology of the<br/>Recognition of Intervals (_Genesis_, 2nd ed., p 92).<br/>For one thing, Partch only illustrates odd-factors up<br/>to 13, when in fact ancient Greek writers used primes up<br/>to 31, and possibly odd-limits which were even larger.<br/>Secondly, Partch includes Eratosthenes in his graph but<br/>does not give him credit for recognizing 13, when in fact<br/>not only did he utilize 13, but also 19.</p><p>Eratosthenes based his system on the prime-factors<br/>2, 3, 5, 13, and 19.</p><p>Eratosthenes used certain 19-limit ratios, but audibly<br/>they are basically identical to  Pythagorean pitches<br/>and intervals which were already in use in theory and<br/>practice in his time, so his employment of 19 could only<br/>be numerological.</p><p>Eratosthenes makes use of a 3==19 xenharmonic bridge<br/>in his scale system, by employing &quot;standard&quot; Pythagorean<br/>3-limit pitches in his diatonic genus, but substituting<br/>19-limit ratios which are very close by in pitch in his<br/>chromatic and enharmonic genera.  For example, one trio<br/>of notes (which constitutes one pair of pitches) is:</p><p>    2  3  5 13 19</p><p>  | 8 -5  0  0  0 |  =   256/243  diatonic trite synemmenenon<br/>- | 2  0  1  0 -1 |  =    20/19   chr. trite &amp; enh. paranete syn.<br/> -------------------<br/>  | 6 -5 -1  0  1 |  =  1216/1215  = ~1.424297941 cents</p><p>The bottom row gives the measurement of this particular bridge.<br/>With a pitch-height or interval distance of less than<br/>1 &amp; 1/2 cents, it&apos;s very unlikely that anyone ever *heard*<br/>any difference between these notes.  (We&apos;d have to use 843-EDO<br/>to have an equal-temperament which gives a degree separating<br/>these two pitches.)  So the only reason Eratosthenes could<br/>possibly have for introducing the 19-limit ratios is<br/>numerological considerations.</p><p>That this is so, is borne out by an examination of the<br/>string-lengths of Eratosthenes&apos;s chromatic and enharmonic<br/>tetrachords (descending in pitch, as was the custom in<br/>ancient Greece, and using the convention of naming &quot;mese&quot;<br/>as &quot;A&quot; and using the _tetrachord meson_ for illustration):</p><p>diatonic:   192 : 216 : 243 : 256<br/>              A    G     F     E</p><p>chromatic:   15 : 18 : 19 : 20<br/>              A   F#    F    E</p><p>enharmonic:  30 : 38 : 39 : 40<br/>              A    F   Fv    E</p><p>So what&apos;s going on here is that Eratosthenes cleverly found<br/>a way, by making use of the 3==19 bridge, to substitute 6:5<br/>in place of the usual Pythagorean 32:27 as the characteristic<br/>interval in his chromatic genus, and still have his chromatic<br/>and enharmonic tetrachords employ superparticular ratios,<br/>without introducing pitches that deviated too far from the<br/>regular Pythagorean ones in use.</p><p>His diatonic &quot;F&quot; is the regular Pythagorean 256/243, but<br/>his chromatic and enharmonic &quot;F&quot;s are both 20/19... and<br/>there is no audible difference.</p><p>The chromatic A:F# 15:18 reduces to a 5:6 &quot;minor 3rd&quot;,<br/>and the 19-limit &quot;F&quot; is a neat arithmetical mean between<br/>the F#:E 9:10 whole-tone.</p><p>Likewise in the enharmonic, the A:F 30:38 reduces to 15:19,<br/>a 19-limit &quot;major 3rd&quot; of ~409.2443014 cents virtually<br/>indistinguishable from the usual Pythagorean 64:81 &quot;major 3rd&quot;,<br/>and 39 is an arithmetical mean between the F:E 38:40 = 19:20<br/>semitone.  (And, as seen above, this 19:20 is nearly the<br/>same as the usual Pythagorean 243:256.)</p><p>See also my post from Wed Dec 22, 1999  2:50 am:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/7159">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/7159</a>&gt;,<br/>for more on Eratosthenes&apos;s use of 19 in his tetrachord divisions.</p><p>Partch mentions that &quot;isolated ratios with even larger<br/>prime numbers&quot; than 13 &quot;are found in the scales compiled<br/>by Ptolemy&quot;.  As we&apos;ve seen, Eratosthenes was no slouch<br/>when it came to using both 13 and, even more prominently,<br/>19.  But Ptolemy did indeed use a whole slew of higher<br/>numbers in his rationalizations of the scales in use<br/>in his day.  His system is based on prime-factors<br/>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 23</p><p>[long delay in sending post because info on Ptolemy was<br/> never added here.
