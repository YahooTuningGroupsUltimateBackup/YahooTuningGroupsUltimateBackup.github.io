Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2000 10:15:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and here are some comments on the thread that<br/>Dan Stearns has started.</p><p>First of all, borrowing a leaf from the turn of the last century in<br/>European music, I&apos;d like to join such composers as Ivor Darreg and<br/>Brian McLaren in calling for what I might call an &quot;emancipation of<br/>concord/discord/entropy,&quot; the recognition of equal citizenship, so to<br/>speak, for all points on the interval continuum.</p><p>Maybe my viewpoint on this is a bit curious. My main orientation is to<br/>Western European music -- but music written before the shifts which<br/>led by the late 17th century, as Paul Erlich has stated, to what he<br/>considers the most important European element of triadic major/minor<br/>tonality.</p><p>Since Gothic music isn&apos;t based on stable thirds, and my &quot;modern&quot;<br/>Renaissance music features a variety of modes and progressions derived<br/>in part from the 3-limit Gothic ones and presenting a significantly<br/>different outlook than late 17th-19th century tonality, does this make<br/>me &quot;uncharacteristically European&quot; -- or something else?</p><p>Kraig Grady has mentioned the polyphony of the Solomon Islands, and my<br/>reaction to hearing this -- maybe first around 1971 -- was, &quot;This<br/>feels quite at home, another wonderful tradition of polyphony based<br/>mainly on those beautiful fifths and fourths.&quot;</p><p>Of course it&apos;s also different, with various nuances a European<br/>Gothic-oriented era ear might not pick up, so I want to speak here<br/>with due caution. However, this music seems to me more a delight than<br/>an enigma, although the real enigma, &quot;What might a native speaker of<br/>this musical language hear in addition to what I&apos;m relishing?&quot; can be<br/>an occasion for enhanced wonder as well as due humility.</p><p>To me, &quot;alternate tunings&quot; mean that all points on the continuum are<br/>open, not just those represented in a &quot;standard&quot; intonation<br/>(e.g. 12-tET, 31-tET, or whatever) or expressed by integer ratios with<br/>a given level of simplicity or complexity.</p><p>The valleys, plateaus, and peaks of the entropy charts should all be<br/>open, Ivor Darreq&apos;s theme of &quot;each equal temperament has its own<br/>flavor&quot; generalized into an emancipation of tunings of all kinds.</p><p>In various world musics, this has already happened, and as William<br/>Sethares has shown, timbre is a vital variable in the equation also.<br/>How interesting that those gamelan fifths and fourths I have relished<br/>turn out to be not so close to 3:2 or 4:3.</p><p>It&apos;s noteworthy that just intonation or &quot;JI&quot; can mean many different<br/>things to different people, and that is maybe just as it should be,<br/>given the diversity of musical styles and cultures.</p><p>For example, if we consider a composition to be &quot;in&quot; a tuning for<br/>which it was likely intended, then most Gothic music is _already_ in<br/>JI: more specifically, 3-limit JI or Pythagorean tuning. Yet this is a<br/>radically different system than the 5-limit or 7-limit systems which<br/>many people associate with the label &quot;JI.&quot;</p><p>Also, for a composer such as LaMonte Young and also for me, &quot;JI&quot; means<br/>more generally &quot;integer ratios, however simple or complex.&quot; This can<br/>lead to a kind of alliance between JI and temperament: complex integer<br/>ratios, like tempered intervals, are more shadings on a continuum than<br/>discrete &quot;locking-in&quot; points.</p><p>While it happens that neo-Gothic music follows what may be a typical<br/>European pattern of stability/instability distinctions and directed<br/>tension, I would honor Daniel Wolf (lamentably offlist at this time)<br/>by suggesting that such patterns, also, should not be taken as any<br/>kind of general norm.</p><p>The emancipation of entropy includes the possibility that points of<br/>&quot;maximum entropy&quot; or &quot;maximum complexity&quot; as judged by various<br/>measures may serve as very pleasing points of rest or conclusion in<br/>some compelling compositions, improvisations, or general styles.</p><p>In the 20th-century, Bela Bartok demonstrated in such pieces as &quot;Major<br/>sevenths, minor seconds,&quot; that traditional European concepts of<br/>&quot;concord/discord&quot; were not invariable laws, and today similar kinds of<br/>demonstrations with intervals at &quot;entropy maxima&quot; might be a timely<br/>exercise, as well as a possible germination point for new musics.</p><p>Given the variety of world musics, I suspect that such &quot;experiments&quot;<br/>may be honored practice in various cultures, and I would urge that<br/>concepts of &quot;concord/discord&quot; or &quot;entropy&quot; take account of world<br/>musical practices, with representation of cross-cultural views on<br/>these questions. The Setharean analysis of gamelan tunings seems to be<br/>a very laudible step in this direction.</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s fitting to conclude this article with a tribute to a<br/>theorist and musician whose contribution may go far beyond his<br/>specialty: Ed Foote, who has gotten me fascinated with the whole theme<br/>of different &quot;flavors&quot; of intervals and subtly graduated degrees of<br/>tension.</p><p>While Ed has focused on these concepts in the setting of European<br/>music from around 1680 to 1850 or a bit later, the era of unequal<br/>&quot;well-temperaments,&quot; more generally they might apply to a range of<br/>other European or world musics -- and to new musics in the making.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
