Interestingly enough, this topic was among my great favorites a couple of years ago. To my surprise,</p><p>I&apos;ve found out that most of the temperaments on the webpages used generators approximating integer factors. In contrast, at the time I was involved in these things &quot;to a larger extent&quot;, I often ended up with completely different generators as I was trying to find such generators which you only require a couple of them to get a full 4:5:6:7 chord. If, in contrast, I try to make the sequence of &quot;steps&quot; very long, I can clearly show that there are other intervals which could well serve as possible generators.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s take the 4375/4374 temperament which I was calling &quot;ragismatic&quot; just to later find out that someone else started calling it &quot;ragismic&quot; (still not sure if my term wasn&apos;t actually older, though). If we say that &quot;X=3/1&quot; and &quot;Y=5/1&quot;, then we have to rise by 7 Xs and fall by 4 Ys (which is quite a lot of tones to go through) just to approximate a 7/2. Because of this, I can see a possibility of repeating interval patterns if one of the generators was 9/5. Therefore, I think there could be a way to achieve similar results with less tones if one generator was 9/5 in this temperament.</p><p>To make an illustration of some possible interval sequences leading to the ragisma, I&apos;ve made one of 16 steps and another of 17 steps. Here they are listed.</p><p>! ragipu16.scl</p><p>!</p><p>16-step ragisma pump (1/3, 10/7, 7/2)</p><p>16</p><p>!</p><p>1/3</p><p>7/6</p><p>7/18</p><p>5/9</p><p>5/27</p><p>35/54</p><p>35/162</p><p>245/324</p><p>175/162</p><p>175/486</p><p>1225/972</p><p>1225/2916</p><p>875/1458</p><p>875/4374</p><p>6125/8748</p><p>4375/4374</p><p>! ragipu17.scl</p><p>!</p><p>17-step ragisma pump (7/6, 5/1, 2/7)</p><p>17</p><p>!</p><p>7/6</p><p>1/3</p><p>5/3</p><p>35/18</p><p>5/9</p><p>35/54</p><p>5/27</p><p>25/27</p><p>175/162</p><p>25/81</p><p>125/81</p><p>875/486</p><p>125/243</p><p>875/1458</p><p>125/729</p><p>875/4374</p><p>4375/4374</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2011 1:11:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For example, let&apos;s take the 4375/4374 temperament which I was calling<br/>&gt; &quot;ragismatic&quot; just to later find out that someone else started calling it<br/>&gt; &quot;ragismic&quot; (still not sure if my term wasn&apos;t actually older, though).

In fact, looking at the spectrum of the temperament</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Spectrum+of+a+temperament">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Spectrum+of+a+temperament</a></p><p>we get 10/9, 6/5, 4/3, 5/4, 9/8, 7/6, 8/7, 9/7, 7/5. Hence, looking for comma pumps with a lot of 10/9 and 6/5 is a place to start, especially as 10/9, 6/5 and 2 generate the 5-limit. Since 7/6 is the lowest complexity 7-limit interval, we head there (or to 12/7). 7/6 is equivalent to 729/625, and 12/7 to 1250/729. Solving an equation with two variables and two unknowns points me to (10/9)^2 (5/3)^2/2 = 1250/729, so one comma pump would be 5/3-10/9-7/12-5/3-10/9-1/2.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/11/2011 4:38:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; we get 10/9, 6/5, 4/3, 5/4, 9/8, 7/6, 8/7, 9/7, 7/5.
