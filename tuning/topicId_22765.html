Should there be a separation based on interests in tempered scales vs. just intonation, or among the 19 tet vs. 24 tet vs.72 tet?  Can those interested in pentatonic scales have much in common with those interested in Partch&apos;s 43 tone scale?  Are there some only interested in live performances vs. those interested only in CD&apos;s vs. those who want mp3 snippets online?   Are those interested in historic intonations really separate from those interested in potential future scales that have never been proposed or used before?  Will there ever be a unified tuning theory which will explain the advantages and disadvantages of equal temperaments and just intonations each in terms of the other?  Is theory really separate from practice?<br/>Do we not need to form a united front against the almost overwhelming omnipresence of 12 tet?  Can we afford to either squabble among ourselves or become divided and diluted into smaller and smaller &quot;denominations&quot;, as has happened with the Christian churches?</p></div><h3><a id=22769 href="#22769">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/14/2001 2:16:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John F.

You immediately<br/>made me think of the biodiversity of Madagascar<br/>and Australia.</p><p>I think Kraig&apos;s right. I&apos;m on both lists. I think<br/>the new list serves a purpose. There really is a<br/>massive volume of posting on this list and it is<br/>of very high quality. I never see the &apos;How ya doin?&apos;<br/>&apos;How _you_ doin?&apos; &apos;Doin&apos; great!&apos; inanity of some<br/>other lists, or the make-money-fast deluge. It is<br/>a normal and positive development that tuning is<br/>becoming of interest to enough people and work in<br/>the field hos grown to the point that we are ready<br/>to move on.</p><p>---- BEGIN OFF TOPIC ----</p><p>As far as the church angle brought up by John goes,<br/>I think it is a good thing there are so many sects.<br/>They are not really divisive enemies of each other.<br/>In Christian theology, all the saved are members of<br/>ONE church REGARDLESS of the sign on the door. The<br/>term church refers to the body of believers, not<br/>to the name of an incorporated nonprofit institution<br/>or to a brick building.</p><p>Different churches serve different people&apos;s spiritual<br/>emotional and social needs depending on where they<br/>are and what they need at different parts of their<br/>lives. Sure, there will be those that can find<br/>counterexamples and cast inflammatory trolls, but<br/>the point is that separation does not necessarily<br/>equal divisiveness.</p><p>Ever try to propagate perennials such as Irises<br/>or Tarragon? You -divide- the roots and replant<br/>and then you have TWICE as many plants and each<br/>one is stronger and more vibrant than the one you<br/>split, sort of reborn!</p><p>There are some churches who have studied the<br/>issue of stagnation and death in the spiritual<br/>lives of their congregations. The problem often<br/>arises in churches that have become static and<br/>too big. By breaking up the congregation into<br/>&apos;small faith communities&apos; of about 8-12 people,<br/>they have seen INCREDIBLE results in the lives<br/>of their members in so far as they suddenly<br/>stop sitting on their butts and listening and<br/>have started to take charge and make their<br/>faith real.</p><p>---- END OFF TOPIC ----</p><p>I refuse to believe that the microtonal movement<br/>or whatever is is is so weak and fragile that it<br/>will fall apart in disarray because an attempt<br/>at healthy growth has been made.</p><p>The sheer volume of posts in this groups really<br/>DOES prevent the &apos;silent 400&apos; of the members<br/>from saying anything. They read the posts and<br/>are so confused and overwhelmed they don&apos;t<br/>know where to start or who to turn to or what<br/>is going on. That is not because there is anything<br/>wrong with what is being said, it&apos;s just because<br/>there is too much of it and it is overwhelming.<br/>And maybe it is a style they don&apos;t jive with.<br/>Why not allow them to form their own small groups?<br/>Those small groups will develop and divide into<br/>other small groups and the number of people<br/>involved in microtonality and composing and<br/>performing microtonal music can only _increase_.</p><p>I really can not see any down side to this.<br/>It&apos;s not like someone posted &quot;I hate all of<br/>you and you are wrong about everything and<br/>I am starting my own group to show you all<br/>how wrong you are.&quot; That&apos;s not it at all! Just<br/>chill out, dudes and let it flow. This is a<br/>sign that the -group-, meaning all microtonalists,<br/>is growing and developing.

He was<br/>puzzled, like others on this list, that some of us really value this<br/>group yet also wanted a second group.  So here&apos;s my own individual<br/>reply, and then his answer.</p><p>Paul wrote:<br/>As the only person who&apos;s ever been referred to as the Tuning Police,<br/>I have to express my deep sorrow at reading this judgment.</p><p>And I replied:</p><p>The last thing in the world I want to do is create ill feelings, yet<br/>I can sense your genuine puzzlement at what seems to be a logical<br/>contradiction. Yet it isn&apos;t (I know this is being to sound very<br/>female:-)).  I was going to write this to the list but let me bounce<br/>it off you first.</p><p>I think Jackie should have called his list the irrational<br/>microtonalalist, or microtuning for numerologists.  My delight in a<br/>second list is I can be confused, silly, totally irrational and<br/>illogical, even mystical, and still be on topic.  That is important<br/>to me because the source of my creativity is irrational, and refuses<br/>to be tied into any rational schemata.  That is what<br/>I mean when I say I part ways with the theorists - that even though I<br/>arrived at the result irrationally (ie by mistake) I still liked it<br/>and kept<br/>it. It seemed very funny to me that after the fact it fit its way<br/>back into being 3-9-11, although I have a feeling you could probably<br/>tell me  how whatI thought was 3-5-11 actually morphed to 3-9-11:-)</p><p>That irrational is mysterious, even infuriating.   And while it just<br/>won&apos;t cooperate with what logic or theory dictates should happen, it<br/>also withers under the glare of a strong analytical mind.  I know<br/>because I have one of those minds too, amd I know well how to mortify<br/>creativity into hiding.  I&apos;ve done it many times, or let it be done<br/>to me under the guise of teaching.  That is<br/>what I meant by the Tuning Police - not you specifically but the<br/>whole idea of an authority figure.  Its more an unspoken assumption<br/>than a role that any one person fits.</p><p>I truly do appreciate you and your genius.  Its just my inner imp<br/>needs to play, and if I don&apos;t let it play with other similarly<br/>confused, unconditional irrational numerologists,  I dry up the<br/>wellspring of my creativity.</p><p>So I love having a whole new tuning to explore, and learn.  The<br/>tuning I use at any given moment comes from an intuition that it<br/>would be a fruitful place to explore(and wait to you hear about how I<br/>get the numbers for my rthyms), and right now my intuition tells me<br/>blackjack is hot for me!</p><p>Anyway these are some thoughts that hopefully will be helpful to<br/>you.  I look at all of this discussion as really a converstion<br/>between left brain,right brain, or yin and yang.  You need both to<br/>make a cycle work, and all of us have both, just in varying<br/>quantities.</p><p>And here is Paul&apos;s reply:</p><p>If he had done that, I&apos;d have very little to contribute, except my<br/>usual<br/>7/12 and 10/22 Kabbalah stuff.If the list were called &quot;the irrational<br/>microtonalalist&quot;, then yes, of<br/>course. But it would seem that you could still be on topic and be<br/>this way<br/>on the tuning list. No &quot;Tuning Police&quot; is going to arrest you!</p><p>So perhaps the result you arrived at was rational all along, and<br/>though the<br/>numbers weren&apos;t what you thought they were, the fact that you used a<br/>certain<br/>set of numbers in a certain way is relevant to how the music came<br/>out, and<br/>maybe you only could have used numbers in that way in a certain<br/>tuning or a<br/>certain class of tunings. That&apos;s what I&apos;d like to help you figure<br/>out.Ah . . . I think that&apos;s different. Again, &quot;Tuning Police&quot; was<br/>only used to refer to me, specifically. And I&apos;m just about the most<br/>anti-authoritarian person you&apos;ll meet<br/>I agree completely, and any thoughts on how to facilitate this<br/>conversation<br/>are most welcome.</p><p>Splitting left from right doesn&apos;t seem to me to be such a<br/>way.</p><p>Mary again:<br/>You know you are correct.  Its been done before and doesn&apos;t work.<br/>Yet I&apos;m not sure what the best solution is.</p><p>Any one else have some thoughts on this dialogue?</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=22785 href="#22785">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>5/14/2001 6:04:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., nanom3@h... wrote:<br/>&gt; My delight in a<br/>&gt; second list is I can be confused, silly, totally irrational and<br/>&gt; illogical, even mystical, and still be on topic.

The analogy between music and religion was apparently not an appropriate one and was something of an afterthought on my part, not thought through.<br/>I hope that an increasing number of lists will not cause us to lose track of each other&apos;s work.<br/>There is certainly a great deal of variety on this list already, but that is not a complaint or an intent to discourage even more.

You immediately<br/>made me think of the biodiversity of Madagascar<br/>and Australia.</p><p>I think Kraig&apos;s right. I&apos;m on both lists. I think<br/>the new list serves a purpose. There really is a<br/>massive volume of posting on this list and it is<br/>of very high quality. I never see the &apos;How ya doin?&apos;<br/>&apos;How _you_ doin?&apos; &apos;Doin&apos; great!&apos; inanity of some<br/>other lists, or the make-money-fast deluge. It is<br/>a normal and positive development that tuning is<br/>becoming of interest to enough people and work in<br/>the field has grown to the point that we are ready<br/>to move on.</p><p>---- BEGIN OFF TOPIC ----</p><p>As far as the church angle brought up by John goes,<br/>I think it is a good thing there are so many sects.<br/>They are not really divisive enemies of each other.<br/>In Christian theology, all the saved are members of<br/>ONE church REGARDLESS of the sign on the door. The<br/>term church refers to the body of believers, not<br/>to the name of an incorporated nonprofit institution<br/>or to a brick building.</p><p>Different churches serve different people&apos;s spiritual<br/>emotional and social needs depending on where they<br/>are and what they need at different parts of their<br/>lives. Sure, there will be those that can find<br/>counterexamples and cast inflammatory trolls, but<br/>the point is that separation does not necessarily<br/>equal divisiveness.</p><p>Ever try to propagate perennials such as Irises<br/>or Tarragon? You -divide- the roots and replant<br/>and then you have TWICE as many plants and each<br/>one is stronger and more vibrant than the one you<br/>split, sort of reborn!</p><p>There are some churches who have studied the<br/>issue of stagnation and death in the spiritual<br/>lives of their congregations. The problem often<br/>arises in churches that have become static and<br/>too big. By breaking up the congregation into<br/>&apos;small faith communities&apos; of about 8-12 people,<br/>they have seen INCREDIBLE results in the lives<br/>of their members in so far as they suddenly<br/>stop sitting on their butts and listening and<br/>have started to take charge and make their<br/>faith real.</p><p>---- END OFF TOPIC ----</p><p>I refuse to believe that the microtonal movement<br/>or whatever is so weak and fragile that it<br/>will fall apart in disarray because an attempt<br/>at healthy growth has been made.</p><p>The sheer volume of posts in this groups really<br/>DOES prevent the &apos;silent 400&apos; of the members<br/>from saying anything. They read the posts and<br/>are so confused and overwhelmed they don&apos;t<br/>know where to start or who to turn to or what<br/>is going on. That is not because there is anything<br/>wrong with what is being said, it&apos;s just because<br/>there is too much of it and it is overwhelming.<br/>And maybe it is a style they don&apos;t jive with.<br/>Why not allow them to form their own small groups?<br/>Those small groups will develop and divide into<br/>other small groups and the number of people<br/>involved in microtonality and composing and<br/>performing microtonal music can only _increase_.</p><p>I really can not see any down side to this.<br/>It&apos;s not like someone posted &quot;I hate all of<br/>you and you are wrong about everything and<br/>I am starting my own group to show you all<br/>how wrong you are.&quot; That&apos;s not it at all!

Please understand that what follows is not directed at anybody in particular on the tuning list.</p><p>I personally hold a lot more enthusiasm for the new practicalmicrotonality list than for the existing tuning list.</p><p>Something like a year ago, I attempted briefly to form an adjunct HTML-message list or newsgroup whereby we could routinely exchange actual musical snippets and real graphical drawings (such as of scores).  I got a great deal of resistance to the idea of putting music<br/>into a list supposedly about music (e.g., &quot;I&apos;m stuck on a University-owned ASCII terminal, so I can&apos;t see HTML messages or listen to MP3 files,&quot; &quot;such messages take too long to download,&quot; &quot;they&apos;d clog up too much disk space,&quot; &quot;I have to write up formal justifications to<br/>get our SysAdmins to enable us to access a new Newsgroup&quot;).</p><p>OK, so I calmly resigned to the idea that list members just aren&apos;t ready - either because of their heavily-theoretical interests or because of technological problems - to work in music.  At this point, I have an Email filter that picks out several key words from<br/>Tuning-list mail, and I read only those messages.  The rest - probably 95% - I chuck without even reading.</p><p>I hope now that the practicalmicrotonality list is evidence that people are starting to realize that practical music in ASCII-only environment isn&apos;t very meaningful.  As I said in the liner notes to the first Xenharmonic Alliance CD, &quot;discussing music in a text-only<br/>medium is like buying and opening a new album and finding, instead of the CD, a slip of paper with the inscription, &apos;3 movements, key of Eb, 152 authentic cadences, 97 plagal cadences, 21 deceptive cadences, and 16 modulations&apos;&quot;</p><p>Now don&apos;t get me wrong though, I do understand the value of Music Theory.  Theory can help performers and composers find patterns and possibilities that aren&apos;t apparent by experimentation alone.  That is meaningful Theory, but the vast majority of what I&apos;ve seen on the<br/>tuning list is at least one - more often two or three - steps of nonpractice beyond that:</p><p>   * Microtonal music:   Actual music snippets, scores, etc.  Virtually no tuning-list messages are of this nature.<br/>   * Theorizing about music:  Suggesting chord progression possibilities or melodic effects (for example) that people could use to make music (essentially the usual meaning of Theory).  Only a handful of tuning-list messages are of this nature.<br/>   * Theorizing about Music Theory:   Mathematical frameworks (e.g., lattices) in which to construct a system of Theory by which you could find chord progressions or melodic effects from which you could make music.  A fair percentage of tuning-list messages are of this<br/>     nature.<br/>   * Theorizing about the theory of Music Theory:  A lot of tuning-list traffic is in this category (e.g., harmonic entropy, when it&apos;s more appropriate to use odd vs. prime limits, or tetrahedral vs. cubic lattices).</p><p>We shall have to see how much more toward the practical end the practicalmicrotonality list gets, but if it succeeds in being more practical, I&apos;ll start paying even less attention to this tuning list than I do now.  You folks are welcome to continue talking about theory<br/>of theory of theory, but I personally am not interested beyond making actual music and the Theory of making music.</p></div><h3><a id=23121 href="#23121">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

Your posts, and your promotion of 88-CET, helped me get passed my JI-only mindset to appreciate the beauty of all kinds of<br/>temperaments, tunings, and scales.</p><p>Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt; OK, so I calmly resigned to the idea that list members just aren&apos;t ready - either because of their heavily-theoretical interests or because of technological problems - to work in music.</p><p>That&apos;s not really fair, is it?  Most of the &quot;math guys&quot; *do* &quot;work in music.&quot;  They supplement their music making by collectively educating themselves (and us) about how music works (that&apos;s what music theory should be, IMO).  Consequently, they end up making better music<br/>than they would have otherwise.</p><p>A few are interested only in the math and the theory, and don&apos;t consider themselves musicians.  It&apos;s not that they aren&apos;t &quot;ready&quot; - it&apos;s not their gift, not their interest.  But in pursuing their gifts and interests, they strengthen the musicians&apos; understanding of music -<br/>and thereby our position from which to make better music.</p><p>If some cannot participate in exchanging non-text material over the web, that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re not ready to make and share music.</p><p>&gt; I hope now that the practicalmicrotonality list is evidence that people are starting to realize that practical music in ASCII-only environment isn&apos;t very meaningful.</p><p>Well, around 30 of us have chosen to tune in to that forum - about 7 percent.  At least one person is there who is not here.  So there&apos;s that possible advantage.  But no one ever forbade anyone from posting anything here that has been posted there.  Granted, you&apos;re a lot<br/>less likely to get your mistakes corrected and your faulty logic straightened out there than here.  To me, that&apos;s a drawback of that list and a great service of this one.</p><p>Perhaps it will be nice to have a separate forum where we can concentrate on application rather than theory, staying in a more right-brained frame of mind while sharing and listening.  That can&apos;t replace the work done on this forum, however.  I like Paul&apos;s idea of splitting<br/>off the heavy theory/math threads instead of the other stuff (I hesitate to say &quot;practical stuff&quot; because of the inevitable practical consequences of theory).  Maybe the harmonic entropy list could be transformed into a general heavy thread list - kind of a parallel track<br/>for trains of greater weight than this list wishes to support for very long.  What do you fellow H. E.ers think of that idea?</p><p>&gt;  Now don&apos;t get me wrong though, I do understand the value of Music Theory.

Perhaps you inadvertently filtered them out?  And there has been a higher concentration of them on the harmonic entropy list than on the tuning list, if you include diagrams and other visual representations of musical intervals.</p><p>&gt;    * Theorizing about music:  Suggesting chord progression possibilities or melodic effects (for example) that people could use to make music (essentially the usual meaning of Theory).</p><p>After joining this list and beginning to understand how and why musical scales work - what you call theory of theory of theory - I was enraged that I had been cheated of this understanding in the supposed music theory courses I had in college.  I actually wrote the Dean of<br/>the School of Fine Arts to ask him why I had to wait 10 years after graduating from his school with a B. Mus. to find out what I went there to learn.  (His answer was weak and really amounted to a non-answer.)</p><p>&gt;    * Theorizing about Music Theory:   Mathematical frameworks (e.g., lattices) in which to construct a system of Theory by which you could find chord progressions or melodic effects from which you could make music.  A fair percentage of tuning-list messages are of this<br/>&gt;      nature.</p><p>Of course.  A lattice diagram describing a set of pitches from which tunings can be taken, and a list of some of those tunings, and descriptions of them, are *not* theorizing about music theory.  They are discussions about tuning.  That&apos;s what we&apos;re here to discuss, as I<br/>understand it.  Not music nor music theory, per se, but tuning.  They&apos;re intimately related, but not equivalent.</p><p>&gt;    * Theorizing about the theory of Music Theory:  A lot of tuning-list traffic is in this category (e.g., harmonic entropy, when it&apos;s more appropriate to use odd vs. prime limits, or tetrahedral vs. cubic lattices).</p><p>I don&apos;t think these are valid distinctions.  When I first grasped the idea of harmonic entropy, it was as if a veil was drawn aside.  Immediately, I began to get more practical, musical use out of a wider variety of scales.  I began to be able to visualize more of what was<br/>happening in my musical perception when intervals are sounded.  I began to see value and beauty in scales I had discounted previously.  I never would have expected to find much of interest in the scales of Wilson&apos;s Golden Horagrams of the Scale Tree without first<br/>encountering harmonic entropy.  I have now written a number of pieces of music in them (MIDI files forthcoming when the web site about it is launched.)  I have already shared some of these with a couple of people in off list discussions and have had very positive feedback.<br/>Sound theory begets musical application.</p><p>And what of odd vs. prime limits, or tetrahedral vs. cubic lattices?  Those ideas are central to certain discussions about tuning, aren&apos;t they?  Build a better lattice and the world will beat a path to your web site.  Well, maybe not but you get the idea.  A better means of<br/>latticing intervals helps all of us who take the time to understand it.  For that matter, a variety of different ways helps us, too.</p><p>&gt; You folks are welcome to continue talking about theory<br/>&gt; of theory of theory, but I personally am not interested beyond making actual music and the Theory of making music.</p><p>Thanks.  I&apos;m very hopeful that we will.  But there is no distinction between the heavy threads on this list and the theory of making music.  The former is a subset of the latter.</p><p>Wish you had posted more about your tuning ideas and how they were involved in your music making.  I missed seeing your name in the list as frequently as it appeared back around 1997.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

You know that you must discipline yourself<br/>first; only then can you excercise freedom within those bounds, and<br/>explore the areas beyond them productively.  If you want to write<br/>well, you study what other writers have done.  First you emulate.<br/>Only after a lot of practice do you begin to develop your own style -<br/>your own &quot;truth&quot; as it were (maybe better to say, the various facets<br/>of truth that you have learned to reflect).  This is the case in all<br/>fields of human endeavor.  If you want to learn quickly and well, you<br/>submit yourself to those who know more than you do.  You allow them<br/>to correct you.

Bear in mind though that there&apos;s a lot of people who gave<br/>up on the list concluding that that&apos;s not the case.</p><p>Also, I&apos;ll set up my mail filters to alert me to things that look like a CD-release notice, and try<br/>very hard to increase my tuning-list-reading budget for the next week and see if what you folks say<br/>is in fact so.</p></div><h3><a id=23357 href="#23357">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 3:44:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gary Morrison &lt;MR88CET@T...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22765.html#23334">/tuning/topicId_22765.html#23334</a></p><p>&gt; Also, I&apos;ll set up my mail filters to alert me to things<br/>&gt; that look like a CD-release notice, and try very hard to<br/>&gt; increase my tuning-list-reading budget for the next week<br/>&gt; and see if what you folks say is in fact so.</p><p>Hi Gary, and welcome &quot;back&quot; to the tuning list.</p><p>This is the second time I&apos;ve seen you saying that you&apos;re<br/>going to give the tuning list a closer look over the next<br/>week.  Please allow me to offer a suggestion:</p><p>I feel that there&apos;s been a lot of fallout recently over<br/>Paul being banned from the other list, and I&apos;d bet that<br/>there will be a lot less activity on this list right now<br/>because of it.  I&apos;m just about ready to take a vacation myself.</p><p>So my suggestion is to go back, rather than forward, and<br/>try to read everything that&apos;s been posted since April 29.</p><p>A few weeks before that Joe Pehrson had been asking about<br/>Ben Johnston&apos;s notation, after having been exposed to it<br/>at Microfest.  Paul and I began a series of responses<br/>explaining why we preferred HEWM notation (look here<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm</a>&gt; if not<br/>familiar) and 72-EDO (== 72-tET) notation to Johnston&apos;s.</p><p>Joe became so interested in 72-EDO that Paul began finding<br/>useful subsets of it for Joe, and this led to the discovery<br/>by Paul and Dave Keenan (with helping hand from Graham<br/>Breed) of a family of tunings that are subsets of 72-EDO,<br/>and which approximate so many JI systems so well that we<br/>call them MIRACLE (an acronym... look here:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/miracle.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/miracle.htm</a>&gt;.)</p><p>I got excited about this and began writing webpages about<br/>it and now have devised a practical way to put it on a<br/>computer keyboard.  Graham has also devised a brand-new<br/>&quot;decimal&quot; notation for it which suits its properties well.<br/>And in the midst of all this, there were a few actual musical<br/>examples created, including Mary&apos;s terrific pieces that<br/>are referenced here and on the other list.</p><p>All this has just happened in the last 3 weeks.  I suggest<br/>you concentrate your search there if your time is so limited.</p><p>Hope that helps readjust your views of the value of<br/>this list.</p><p>In greatest sincerity,</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=23361 href="#23361">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 4:19:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gary Morrison &lt;MR88CET@T...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22765.html#23093">/tuning/topicId_22765.html#23093</a></p><p>&gt; Now don&apos;t get me wrong though, I do understand the value of Music<br/>Theory.  Theory can help performers and composers find patterns and<br/>possibilities that aren&apos;t apparent by experimentation alone.  That is<br/>meaningful Theory, but the vast majority of what I&apos;ve seen on the<br/>&gt; tuning list is at least one - more often two or three - steps of<br/>nonpractice beyond that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    * Microtonal music:   Actual music snippets, scores, etc.<br/>Virtually no tuning-list messages are of this nature.<br/>&gt;    * Theorizing about music:  Suggesting chord progression<br/>possibilities or melodic effects (for example) that people could use<br/>to make music (essentially the usual meaning of Theory).  Only a<br/>handful of tuning-list messages are of this nature.</p><p>Gary, I beg your pardon, but I don&apos;t see how you can say all this<br/>about this list.  You must not be reading many of the posts.</p><p>We have just received a chord progression from Graham Breed in a<br/>new &quot;miracle&quot; tuning, and within the last year there have been<br/>multimedia links up the kazoo!</p><p>Even TWO years ago, we had great progressions regarding drift of<br/>various intervals in just intonation.</p><p>These ALL had audio files.  In fact, much of this work has been done<br/>by Joe Monzo, so I see your post as really belittling his work...</p><p>Sorry...</p><p>_________ _______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=23416 href="#23416">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MR88CET@TEXAS.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2001 3:48:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Gary, I beg your pardon, but I don&apos;t see how you can say all this<br/>&gt; about this list.  You must not be reading many of the posts.</p><p>Yes, as I mentioned earlier, I said most of what I said earlier based upon what the tuning list<br/>was like about 1.5 years ago when I grew numb to the whole thing.  I therefore resolved that I&apos;ll<br/>look over the list over the course of the next week and reassess how much practical value has come<br/>of it in recent times.  I&apos;m hoping that I&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Also, bear in mind that I never suggested that the tuning list was worthless or should be shut<br/>down or anything like that.  I only opined that it wasn&apos;t resulting in much actual music, and thus<br/>that the separate &quot;practicalmicrotonality&quot; list has value.</p></div>
