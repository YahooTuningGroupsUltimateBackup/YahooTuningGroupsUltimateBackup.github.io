How does your program handle these?<br/>&gt;In fact, though I mentioned only two, there are three things my program<br/>&gt;considers:<br/>&gt;   . The pain of changing the tuning of a note previously (or<br/>&gt;     continuously) sounding.<br/>&gt;   . The pain of any chord being out of tune (as measured by<br/>considering<br/>&gt;     all pairs of notes sounding).<br/>&gt;   . The pain of &quot;drift&quot;: when the average tuning shift of all notes<br/>&gt;     sounding moves either above or below zero.<br/>&gt;This last counteracts the tendency of the progressions you mention to<br/>&gt;pump the tuning downward (or upward, when reversed).</p><p>Excellent!</p><p>&gt;I need to review the math of 22TET, but, assuming that each interval<br/>&gt;there has a 1:1 mapping with a corresponding JI interval, such a<br/>&gt;translation would be very easy, and would not involve actually casting<br/>&gt;about for different JI interpretations.</p><p>Well, it&apos;s about as easy for the 7-limit as 12-tET is for the 5-limit,<br/>but there are always tricky cases. Two stacked fourths in 22-tET give<br/>you a near-7:4; three give you a near-7:6; and four give you a near-9:7.<br/>Two major triads a half-octave apart (Petroushka chord) have good<br/>approximations to one another&apos;s harmonic 7ths. Etc.</p><p>&gt;Though, the &quot;comma pump&quot; chord sequence you mention<br/>&gt;can&apos;t be easily resolved in any ET that &quot;supports a comma&quot; (which, it<br/>&gt;appears, 22TET DOES, and 31TET, oddly, does NOT).</p><p>Not odd at all -- that is why 31-tET is so popular for diatonic music.<br/>22-tET is HORRIBLE for diatonic music. I&apos;ve found 10-tone scales that<br/>function &quot;diatonically&apos; in 22-tET and give you rich 7-limit harmonic<br/>resources (tetrads instead of triads):<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>. There are errors of 17<br/>cents involved in the 22-tET approximation of 7:5 (the maximum error in<br/>the 7-limit), so a dynamic tuning approach would help about as much as<br/>it would help 5-limit music written in 12-tET. There&apos;s also the 26-tET<br/>thing I mentioned earlier tonight.</p></div><h3>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/1999 8:54:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; I need to review the math of 22TET, but, assuming that each interval<br/>&gt;&gt; there has a 1:1 mapping with a corresponding JI interval, such a<br/>&gt;&gt; translation would be very easy, and would not involve actually casting<br/>&gt;&gt; about for different JI interpretations.</p><p>While all the 5-limit consonances have a 1:1 mapping in 12TET, there are<br/>a couple of exceptions when using 22TET for 7-limit:</p><p>   -&#x9;7:5 is represented by the same interval (11/22TET) as its<br/>&#x9;inversion, 10:7.<br/>   -&#x9;8:7, a 7-limit consonance, is represented by the same interval<br/>&#x9;(4/22TET) as 9:8, which is _not_ a 7-limit consonance.</p><p>Of course, these should be resolvable through harmonic context; however,<br/>I think it will make the translation a little less straightforward,<br/>since the mapping is not quite 1:1.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu">manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Well, so far, every time I break he runs out.<br/>  -\-\-- o    But he&apos;s gotta slip up sometime . . . &quot;</p><p>             NOTE: dehyphenate node to remove spamblock.          &lt;*&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul H.

So the half-octave is really the only<br/>&quot;new&quot; problem for 7-limit 22-tET. As I mentioned before, this interval<br/>actually sounds more consonant when used as a 7:5 then as a 10:7, so a<br/>good &quot;extra&quot; compositional guideline for 22-tET would be to voice all<br/>chords so that the half-octave always represents 7:5.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
