What I looked for most of all was an A-B comparison<br/>&gt;that would maintain all factors constant apart from the temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The broadcast did include a passage of Brahms (unfamiliar to me)<br/>&gt;played on two organs, one of them the Goshen College organ built to<br/>&gt;the Lehman-Bach temperament, but the organs were of different timbre,<br/>&gt;the harmonies in the piece rather thick and even muddy on any<br/>&gt;instrument, and any differences attributable to temperament were not<br/>&gt;apparent to me.  (I should maybe confess to being a<br/>&gt;sometimes-cloth-eared cellist but I don&apos;t think I was especially<br/>&gt;cloth-eared today!)  There was a playthrough of an extract of Bach&apos;s<br/>&gt;&apos;Mensch bewein dein&apos; Suende gross..&apos; which has a modulation to a<br/>&gt;remote key towards the end, and this is said to test well-tempered<br/>&gt;tunings and to display the special qualities of the Bach-Lehman tuning<br/>&gt;-- and it certainly sounded well but unfortunately we were not treated<br/>&gt;to a comparison in any other temperament.  I found the narrative was<br/>&gt;patronising:  it assumed that listeners knew nothing of the issues,<br/>&gt;and made it out that a definitive truth had been found,<br/>&gt;albeit one attended with controversy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So I found the broadcast of limited use and for me the &apos;jury is still<br/>&gt;out&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Terry Stancliffe<br/>&gt;Cambridge</p></div><h3>bachjohann_sebastian &#x3C;Francis@datacomm.ch&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2005 4:29:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Nowitzky &lt;nowitzky@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found the narrative waspatronising:  it assumed that listeners<br/>&gt; knew nothing of the issues, and made it out that a definitive truth<br/>&gt; had been found, albeit one attended with controversy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I found the broadcast of limited use and for me the &apos;jury is<br/>&gt; still out&apos;.</p><p>I might add that nothing in the program indicated that the Lehman<br/>interpretation was chronologically the fourth to appear.

I explained it fully, and stated frankly in the<br/>interview that several other interpretations of the same drawing have<br/>preceded mine by several years (although I did not know about them<br/>until that e-mail from Hitchin, 2004).  I explained how this spurred<br/>me to go look closely at the Bach drawing myself, and to figure out<br/>the theory and historical context as to why the Sparschuh-Zapf<br/>premise of constant beat rates is mistaken (in my considered<br/>*opinion* of course, with background in research and harpsichord<br/>tuning by-ear for 20+ years; and a _temperament ordinaire_ project<br/>was one of the main components of my doctoral study 11 years ago).</p><p>We went into all the &quot;controversy&quot; section of the interview in<br/>considerable depth and detail: I made SURE in my preparations for the<br/>interview that I would say plenty about this bit of the controversy<br/>that several people foist upon this whole project in internet<br/>discussions.  (But no, I did not mention BY NAME any of the several<br/>people who have had personal vendettas to smear my name/reputation in<br/>public on this; a national radio broadcast is not an appropriate<br/>forum to vent other people&apos;s cynicism against me!)</p><p>I also provided more than 150 minutes of representative music samples<br/>on organ and harpsichord, and we talked about various of those during<br/>the interview as the presenter and producer were trying to decide<br/>what to use.

They spliced, shortened, and resequenced my responses to<br/>every question, and they rearranged/retaped some of their own<br/>questions after the interview session to give the whole thing a<br/>better straight-through flow, a better and more concise setup to the<br/>words of mine that they chose to use in the final product.  And in my<br/>opinion they did terrific work with it, providing several levels of<br/>depth and general concepts so their listenership will have something<br/>to spark the interest while listening.  This was entirely up to them,<br/>doing their jobs, constructing a program of appropriate length and<br/>focus from the raw material provided; and I of course answered all<br/>their interview questions cheerfully and honestly, along with<br/>volunteering additional information they ended up not using.</p><p>The playlist they settled upon is here:<br/><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/pip/z9s45/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/pip/z9s45/</a><br/>and for this week only, the program is available directly as the<br/>&quot;Sunday&quot; link at<br/><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/</a></p><p>=====</p><p>As for anyone who would like to hear more direct A/B comparisons<br/>between various temperaments and this one, there has already been a<br/>CD set available since May:<br/><a href="http://www.frogmusic.com/temperamentalcds.html">http://www.frogmusic.com/temperamentalcds.html</a><br/>Pressler and Jones have produced this at their initiative, and I<br/>believe it is a good resource for that type of comparative listening<br/>(and they used exactly the same MIDI sequences in each pair of<br/>comparisons).</p><p>At the same time, I believe it still does not take the place of hands-<br/>on *playing* acoustic instruments that are set up in various<br/>temperaments, i.e. experiencing the way the tensions/resolutions of<br/>various temperaments affect the interpretation as it goes along,<br/>suggesting timing and phrasing/articulative details to a performer.</p><p>During a delightful holiday last week I had the opportunity of two<br/>additional practice sessions (half day each) at the organ in northern<br/>Indiana that is tuned this way (Goshen College, Taylor &amp; Boody Opus<br/>41); and a contrasting session the same week playing the new<br/>University of Notre Dame organ (built by Paul Fritts; in Kirnberger<br/>3) for two hours.

Have you<br/>written them up, and are they online anywhere?</p><p>It seems to me that another way to look at the<br/>characteristics of the Lehman/Bach temperament is<br/>to look at the pitches that it uses:  A near<br/>comparator appears to be &apos;Vallotti&apos;.  All the<br/>&apos;white&apos; notes in Lehman (except B), plus E-flat,<br/>appear to be the same as in Vallotti.  B, F# and<br/>C# are sharpened by 4 cents in Lehman relative<br/>to Vallotti;  G# is sharpened by nearly 2 cents,<br/>and B-flat is flattened by nearly 2 cents<br/>relative to Vallotti.</p><p>The results for major thirds appear to be, that<br/>the sharp errors are increased in Lehman (relative<br/>to Vallotti) for the major thirds on G,D,A,E and<br/>B-flat, but reduced for the major thirds on B,<br/>F#, C# and G#.  The major thirds on E-flat, F and<br/>C appear to be the same in Lehman as in Vallotti.</p><p>I only mention Vallotti as a numerical comparator<br/>because it looks conveniently similar numerically,<br/>maybe there are other and better comparators<br/>acoustically.</p><p>It would be interesting to know about aural<br/>comparisons that have been run in practice<br/>between temperaments.  As you mention having<br/>done some, it would be very good to have a<br/>description.</p><p>Regards<br/>Terry Stancliffe<br/>Cambridge</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/>To help you stay safe and secure online, we&apos;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
