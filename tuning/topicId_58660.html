After 40 years of playing guitar, including rock and roll, pop, blues, country, jazz, bluegrass, folk, classical, flamenco, funk, reggae, and avant/free jazz; after thousands of gigs, from slimy bars to Symphony pops, outdoor festivals to school assemblies, and hundreds of recording sessions, as well as teaching hundreds of students, not to mention many years of intensive study of tuning concepts from many different cultures...I have come to the conclusion that a scale is some notes arranged in a horizontal, linear fashion (or perhaps a gentle slope), and chords are notes stacked in a vertical way. This basic concept has got me through all the aforementioned situations with flying colors, so it works very well. Not so hard, the way I see it...hope this helps clear up any confusion...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div>
