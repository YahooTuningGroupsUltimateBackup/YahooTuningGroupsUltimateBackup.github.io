<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Modes of porcupine[7]</h1><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2011 3:52:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was explaining Porcupine[7] to some of my friends. I showed them<br/>some comma pumps from it from my handy dandy iPhone app. Since they<br/>seemed to think it was cool, the discussion turned eventually into how<br/>we need to name the modes for it. I said that there are a infinite<br/>amount of scales, and we have no way to reference the modes for any of<br/>them. So I explained what a &quot;generator&quot; was, and conjectured a<br/>universal system would have to be something like 1 generators going<br/>up, two generators going up, etc. I proposed something like &quot;1up,&quot;<br/>&quot;2up,&quot; &quot;3up,&quot; etc as shorthand for this.</p><p>My friend Steve had no idea why I was bombarding him with ridiculous<br/>math and instead decided that Delorean mode was the way to go. He then<br/>suggested Fallopian mode as well. I decided he was on the right track<br/>and threw Presbyterian mode into the mix, and conjectured that perhaps<br/>Barbarian mode might be a good option. Someone suggested Lesbian mode<br/>in addition as being vaguely plausible.</p><p>Then tonight, after posting it on Facebook, my other friend Steve<br/>suggested Aryan and Antidisestablishmentarian mode. This gives us 7<br/>modes. For porcupine[8], it seemed natural that the last mode should<br/>be Mixoantidisestablishmentarian mode, but after my ubiquitously drunk<br/>friend Urie popped up on my Facebook wall, we&apos;re changing that to<br/>Bacardian mode. So that makes 8 - Delorian, Fallopian, Presbyterian,<br/>Lesbian, Barbarian, Aryan, Antidisestablishmentarian, and Bacardian<br/>mode. Now we&apos;re set.</p><p>...</p><p>There is a huge divide between this community and real life musicians.<br/>Real life musicians are interested in this stuff, but when they ask me<br/>to explain it, I have no idea where to begin. My friend Steve, the<br/>first Steve I mentioned, is one of the most musically talented people<br/>on the planet, but he hates math. He doesn&apos;t want to hear me talk<br/>about overtones and frequency ratios, he doesn&apos;t want to hear about<br/>MOS scales, the word &quot;temperament&quot; makes his eyes glaze over, and when<br/>I say &quot;rank 2&quot; he probably thinks I&apos;m talking about the military.<br/>We&apos;re dealing with people can barely handle that the whole thing is<br/>called &quot;the porcupine scale&quot; to begin with. They cannot handle phrases<br/>like &quot;porcupine generator,&quot; nor can they handle the phrase &quot;Hanson<br/>pump&quot; either. I have no idea how they&apos;ll react if I ever mention<br/>Mothra or Wuerschmidt.</p><p>It&apos;s not even just this one issue. The divide manifests itself in<br/>subtle little ways. For instance, at one point, I found myself<br/>demonstrating the difference between 6/5 and 7/6, and then 9/7 vs 5/4.<br/>Then, in the ensuing discussion, I dropped the &quot;subminor&quot; and<br/>&quot;supermajor&quot; terminology. Now, we don&apos;t notice this when we&apos;re typing,<br/>but &quot;supermajor&quot; is very unwieldy to say. It&apos;s four syllables. It&apos;s<br/>not very hip. It sounds dumb. So I tried to just call it a &quot;super<br/>third,&quot; because that&apos;s much easier, and also saves calories.</p><p>My friend Tivon, who I was talking to at the time, finally had enough<br/>of the uber-dorky phrase &quot;super third&quot; and decided we were going to<br/>call them diminished and augmented thirds like normal people. I of<br/>course told him subminor thirds were more like augmented seconds. Now,<br/>another thing that we don&apos;t realize on this list is that this to call<br/>7/6 an augmented second is absolutely ridiculous, because they&apos;re not<br/>seconds, they&apos;re thirds, as anyone with a pair of ears can very easily<br/>tell you. So I think we settled on &quot;little minor third&quot; and &quot;big minor<br/>third&quot; at the end. (If you&apos;re going to respond to this paragraph with<br/>a quote from Rothenberg, read between the lines.)</p><p>I have no idea how to solve this problem. All I know is how musicians<br/>learn, which is that they like to take what they know and extend it.<br/>This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that everything has to fit into a<br/>diatonic framework, but it does mean that I wish we had easy<br/>pedagogical techniques to draw them into the new paradigm. As it<br/>stands, I have no idea how to explain most of this stuff without<br/>resorting to group theory. All I know is - try using the phrase &quot;minor<br/>whole tone&quot; and see what kind of reaction you get. Or go try to<br/>explain negri temperament to someone in 19-equal. Also may God have<br/>mercy on your soul. Maybe Igs or Carl or someone else has some good<br/>tips for all of this.</p><p>Ironically enough, while they couldn&apos;t handle generators, visualizing<br/>JI lattices and talking about &quot;prime intervals&quot; seemed to pose no<br/>trouble at all. So I don&apos;t get it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2011 9:57:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You should show your friends my Negri video and see what they think.  I&apos;m also uploading a 16-EDO video right now that you should show them, using the 5L+1s scale.</p><p>(Side note: Ron Sword calls 16-EDO&apos;s 5L+1s scale &quot;Cynder&quot;.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s Cynder, though, because that&apos;s another name for Mothra and Mothra tempers out 1029/1024 and 81/80, whereas this scale tempers 135/128 instead of 81/80.  I guess this makes it very much a gamelan temperament, since these two commas are respectively the gamelisma and the pelogic comma.  Does it have a name somewhere?)</p><p>Anyway, these videos I&apos;ve been making for YouTube reflect my best guess at the best way to present these scales.  Whenever I show someone one of my guitars, I always start with the chords they&apos;re good and/or bad for, then maybe a couple scales, then I hand the instrument over and let them noodle around.  (Interesting side-note: I recently showed someone my 19-EDO and 16-EDO guitars, and after playing both he thought 16-EDO sounded more &quot;normal&quot; and 19-EDO sounded out-of-tune.  How do you like THEM apples??)  I&apos;ve found that it&apos;s usually a bad idea to try to explain anything too in-depth in a friendly conversation.  Eventually I&apos;ll have a book to show people, but in the meantime I&apos;m going to try to pump out a bunch of instructional videos.</p><p>What seems to be the most important thing is to go into as little background as possible.  People don&apos;t know (and often don&apos;t want to know) anything about the psychoacoustic reasons we use 12-TET.  They just know they like the sound of it and it&apos;s &quot;normal&quot;.  Absolutely the most important thing to do when showing off a new tuning is to show that it doesn&apos;t sound too weird to care about, but sounds weird enough to be different.  Don&apos;t give them more information than they ask for, and under NO circumstances should you introduce any new terminology unless it&apos;s absolutely essential to answer a question they&apos;ve asked.  One question NO ONE has ever asked me is &quot;why DOESN&apos;T this sound bad to me?&quot;, and that is the ONLY question that would merit any discussion of psychoacoustics.</p><p>Visual aids can help as well--showing them how tunings and scales compare visually to a major or minor scale or 12-TET itself is great.  This shows them how these new scales live &quot;in the cracks&quot; between familiar notes.  You pretty much HAVE TO relate everything back to 12-TET, at least in the beginning.  Some people might get really into this, and for those people you can start going into the bigger picture, but for most people it&apos;s an idle curiousity and they get bored quickly when you start barraging them with new information that they can&apos;t relate back to what they know.</p><p>Coming up with wacky mode names for Porcupine is great.  Humor is immensely important here because it maintains interest.  I used to hate the wacky hodge-podge of temperament names, but the more I try to explain this stuff to regular musicians, the more I appreciate names like &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Orwell&quot;.</p><p>I wish Jacob and Andrew were still active here.  They&apos;d surely have excellent contributions to this topic.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was explaining Porcupine[7] to some of my friends.

Then the answer puts them to sleep.</p><p>That&apos;s because you&apos;re answering them in the wrong way.  Say you went to cooking school and studied French cuisine in great depth.  Say you were taught all sorts of rules about how different flavors and ingredients should be combined and so on.  Then say you go out to a Thai restaurant where all the rules you were taught are broken, but you love the food.  You ask your friend Bill (who is a food scientist and also a pretty good cook in his own right) why this food--which breaks all the rules of French cuisine--tastes so good.  He launches into a long diatribe about the chemistry of flavor and the anatomy of the tongue and the neurophysiology of taste perception.  Sure, his answer might be technically correct and very informative, but it probably won&apos;t succeed in answering your question because you won&apos;t understand most of it and will probably get bored and tune it out.</p><p>Now imagine you ask your friend Zombo (a worldly chap who spends all his free time and money traveling the world and sampling the cuisines of various cultures) the same question.  His response is short and simple: &quot;the rules of French cuisine are not universal.  Lots of things can taste good if you have an open mind and an adventurous spirit.  There are very few absolutes and most &quot;rules&quot; are culture-specific, not universal.  To make good food, all one needs is a sensitive tongue, a desire to experiment, and a bit of common sense (and maybe a bit of basic knowledge about how to properly and safely use various cooking implements found in a kitchen).&quot;</p><p>Granted, if you were already interested in food science a little bit, you might appreciate Bill&apos;s answer a bit more than Zombo&apos;s.  But if you&apos;re just interested in cooking and eating, Bill&apos;s answer will turn you off and maybe even make you regret you asked the question.  Zombo&apos;s answer, OTOH, will probably open your mind a bit and maybe inspire you to experiment a bit with breaking some of your usual rules.  This is a much better outcome, and the outcome we should strive for when talking with regular musicians.  It&apos;s better to foster an attitude of curiousity and experimentalism than to try to inculcate a rigorous factual understanding.  The deeper math/science stuff should only ever be introduced after someone is already making their own microtonal music and is looking to answer questions/solve problems that can&apos;t really be solved any other way, or unless they&apos;re already versed in math and/or physics and/or psychoacoustics.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2011 7:32:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, May 9, 2011 at 10:07 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I dug the Negri video, but I think it would be too out there for them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stylistically or informationally?<br/>//snip<br/>&gt; As opposed to what?

Now,<br/>&gt; another thing that we don&apos;t realize on this list is that<br/>&gt; this to call 7/6 an augmented second is absolutely<br/>&gt; ridiculous, because they&apos;re not seconds, they&apos;re thirds,<br/>&gt; as anyone with a pair of ears can very easily tell you.<br/>&gt; So I think we settled on &quot;little minor third&quot; and &quot;big<br/>&gt; minor third&quot; at the end.
