Looks like you put in a good shift with<br/>that commission. I went to an open air production of Midsummer&apos;s Nights<br/>Dream over the summer. The play has lots of magic in it and the music<br/>was live with keyboard, brass and flute, well written and in 12 tet. The<br/>music tried to get into corners that can only be reached with<br/>microtonality and it struck me that it would be most appropriate and a<br/>good opportunity for microtonalists to set Shakespeare&apos;s songs. Perhaps<br/>other theatre groups will hear your music and ask for more.</p><p>The Dowland is a nice touch. Did you know that you are following in the<br/>footsteps of Benjamin Britten who used a Dowland theme in one of his few<br/>compositions for guitar?</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/1/2001 7:59:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27758">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27758</a></p><p>&gt; Hello Joseph<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry to have taken a while to listen to your Shakespearian<br/>settings but<br/>&gt; they are truly enchanting and I would have loved to have seen and<br/>heard<br/>&gt; the play itself with your music.

Actually, it only took me 4<br/>evenings!  However, they were four evenings with me about the color<br/>of a sheet, in a state of shock...  I was rather concerned that I<br/>wouldn&apos;t finish in time!</p><p>I was surprised when the costumer told me he hadn&apos;t heard any<br/>Renaissance music used with Shakespearian settings recently.  Maybe<br/>it isn&apos;t the &quot;in thing&quot; these days.  Anyway, that&apos;s what I wanted to<br/>hear with the play... and it certainly doesn&apos;t surprise me if people<br/>have done that before.  After all, *some* of the songs in<br/>Shakespearian plays are actually Renaissance tunes!  I&apos;m thinking,<br/>specifically, at the moment of _Oh Mystress Mine_ by Thomas Morley<br/>which is in _Twelfth Night_... but there are many others...</p><p>Here is a funny one.  I can actually see the play (including my wife<br/>doing some parts) from my window on the 35th floor!  I use a pair of<br/>binoculars and can see quite a bit of the action, since it is in a<br/>courtyard and roof right across the street... but 34 floors down!</p><p>best,</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2001 8:41:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:Here is a funny one.
