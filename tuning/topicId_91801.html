But so be it.  This is just for the purpose<br/>of stating what I&apos;m doing, like a user profile.<br/>*****<br/>This is what I&apos;m doing.  Other people are free to do the same or<br/>different.  This is what I&apos;m doing, but I may have time left over to<br/>explore, to try different things after the main project.</p><p>While I would love to be able to write with the tact, clarity, and<br/>wisdom of Margo Schulter, I can&apos;t do that.<br/>I&apos;ve learned a lot from this list, and it&apos;s made a big difference.  I&apos;ve<br/>learned about Scala files, Pianotech, and that there are a group of<br/>theorists who are working on a much higher level of mathematical<br/>sophistication than me.  I&apos;ve learned that people here have come up with<br/>hundreds of scales, including sophisticated hybrids between temperaments<br/>and Just Intonation, including non-octave scales.  I&apos;ve only learned a<br/>little of the terminology.<br/>I offer this to make my purposes clear, but also to discourage people<br/>from completely dismissing what I&apos;m doing with strong rhetoric.  If you<br/>can find contradictions here that are more than purely verbal, it might<br/>be interesting to know that.  If there are possibilites within my<br/>&quot;givens&quot; that I haven&apos;t thought of, it might be interesting to hear<br/>them.  Please attempt to read with understanding.  The &quot;givens&quot; are,<br/>well, givens.  If there is a scale in addition to what I describe here<br/>that I ought to consider, by all means describe it.<br/>You can hold me to the same standard.  If I dismiss what you&apos;re<br/>doing--calling it still-born, or misguided--you can remind me of what<br/>I&apos;ve written here.<br/>On this list alone--this oasis of enlightment--I&apos;ve heard each one of<br/>the 6 givens and 7 &quot;less-given&quot; assumptions below dismissed or<br/>denigrated at one time or another.  This makes me sad, sometimes.<br/>I must keep my morale up.<br/>You probably do, too.</p><p>Givens:<br/>#1) I have good relative pitch but weak absolute pitch.  I can hear<br/>5-cent increments if pitches are sounded together or successively on the<br/>piano.  I can&apos;t sing 5-cent increments, and this doesn&apos;t bother me.  I&apos;m<br/>not a singer.<br/>#2) The arbiter of hearability is only me, testing simultaneous-sounding<br/>notes (chords) on a &quot;synthesized&quot; piano. (Pianotech) (What I can hear, I<br/>care about.  What I can&apos;t hear, I don&apos;t care about.)</p><p>#3) What I want to hear in my music: The sound of multiple overtone<br/>series, exactly in tune: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. (And its inverse,<br/>sometimes.)<br/>#4) What I want to hear in my music: The sound of the tuning-base of the<br/>overtone series changing often, where at least one common-tone is held.<br/>(That is, &quot;chord-changes&quot;, not harmonically static music.)<br/>#5) What I&apos;m making:  An electronic, finished piece of music (A sequence<br/>or a recording of a sequence or a recording of an improvisation)<br/>realized on standard, mass-produced equipment, with instruments with<br/>harmonic spectra.  (As in synthesized voice, piano, guitar, etc.) (Not:<br/>a score, a happening, an interactive composition. Not a C-sound piece,<br/>not a piece with non-harmonic instrumental spectra. Those are all worthy<br/>goals, too.)</p><p>#6) More than one standard keyboard-controller can be used<br/>simultaneously to extend the available range at hand.  With three<br/>controllers, one can work with a large scale over the full registral<br/>range.</p><p>Assumptions: (&quot;Less-givens&quot;)<br/>#7) It&apos;s easier to only have to learn only *one* keyboard pattern, so<br/>the scale is going to be a multiple of 12 pitches--either 36, 48, or 60<br/>pitches. (see #5--mass-produced equipment) A scale with a number of<br/>pitches that is not a multiple of 12 necessitates learning more than one<br/>pattern.  The scale must be internalized, learned to the point that<br/>playing (ear-to-hand) is fluent.<br/>#8) With at least 36 pitches, the smallest interval is going to be no<br/>more than around 100 cents, just by result of  Given #3).  Given that,<br/>&quot;gaps&quot; are not much of an issue. See #9.<br/>#9) The scale is not a sounding gestalt* or sounding thing in itself, or<br/>a complete formal entity. Rather, it is a convenience.  That is, it is<br/>no more and no less than a collection of pitches ready-to-hand, some of<br/>which sound together at any given time in the piece. It is only the sum<br/>of its parts, so to speak. Many--in fact most--combinations of pitches<br/>will never occur, and the least likely to occur together are adjacent<br/>pitches. (Exception: glisses and coloristic effects.)<br/>It is mainly a collection of related overtone series, each with a common<br/>overtone, the 1/1.<br/>It is only the collection of pitches to be used first. Then, if other<br/>pitches are needed, I can change (transpose) the tuning-base. This can<br/>be done near-instantly with pitch-bend, if the pitch-bend range is set<br/>to +-12. The scale is not really to be heard as a series of steps from<br/>lowest to highest, that&apos;s just a result of piling up<br/>harmonically-related pitches in a sequence.<br/>#10) The scale should be able to approximate a 12ET scale, if not<br/>perfectly. 12ET is to be incorporated, not avoided. It is a wonderful<br/>thing, 12ET.<br/>#11) Adding more than 60 pitches per 2/1 becomes gradually more and more<br/>unwieldy and limited in range on a standard keyboard.  It gradually<br/>becomes harder to understand--even for a dedicated individual--and to<br/>learn.  Pitches I don&apos;t need &quot;at hand&quot; won&apos;t be included.<br/>#12) Practical considerations are as important, perhaps even more<br/>important to the stated goals, than abstract principles.  (By<br/>&apos;practical&apos; I don&apos;t mean being a success or making money or developing a<br/>following, I mean getting a piece done.)<br/>#13) Perfection is unattainable.  There is no Holy Grail of Scales.<br/>(Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.)</p><p>*gestalt: a configuration or pattern of elements so unified as a whole<br/>that it cannot be described merely as a sum of its parts.</p><p>The scale with 48 pitches:</p><p>! caleb48.scl!48 note 13-limit scale 48  PC RATIO   !   a2 1/184.5  bb2<br/>[4/3 below 7/5, or 21/20]111.7  b2 16/15 128.3  c3 14/13138.6  c#3<br/>13/12150.6  d3 12/11<br/>165  d#3 11/10182.4  e3 10/9203.9  f3 9/8231.2  f#3 8/7266.9  g3<br/>7/6289.2  g#3 13/11<br/>294.1  a3 32/27315.6  bb3 6/5347.4  b3 11/9359.47 c4 16/13386.3  c#4<br/>5/4417.5  d4 14/11<br/>435.1  d#4 9/7454.2  e4 13/10498  f4 4/3536.95 f#4 15/11551.3  g4<br/>11/8563.4  g#4 18/13<br/>582.5  a4 7/5 617.5  a#4 10/7636.6  b4 13/9648.7  c5 16/11663  c#5<br/>22/15702  d5 3/2<br/>745.8  d#5 20/13764.9  e5  14/9782.5  f5 11/7813.7  f#5 8/5840.53 g5<br/>13/8852.6  g#5 18/11<br/>884.4  a5 5/3905.9  a#5 27/16933.1  b5 12/7968.8  c6 7/4996.1  c#6<br/>16/91017.6 d6 9/5<br/>1035  d#6 20/111049.4 e6 11/61061.4 f6 24/131071.7 f#6 13/71088.3 g6<br/>15/81115.5 g#6 [4/3 above 10/7, or 40/21]<br/>1200  a6 2/1</p></div><h3><a id=91802 href="#91802">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2010 10:20:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I for one like your manifesto!</p><p>Chris</p><p>&gt; #13) Perfection is unattainable. &nbsp;There is no Holy Grail of Scales. &nbsp;(Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.)</p></div><h3><a id=91804 href="#91804">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2010 11:09:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;calebmrgn&quot; &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; #10) The scale should be able to approximate a 12ET scale, if not<br/>&gt; perfectly. 12ET is to be incorporated, not avoided.
