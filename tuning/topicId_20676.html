The term fits such systems as<br/>medieval Pythagorean intonation (pure fifths), Renaissance meantones<br/>(narrow fifths), and neo-Gothic equitones (wide fifths) as used in<br/>these stylistic contexts.</p><p>In an equitone, for example, a major third is derived from four fifths<br/>up less two octaves (e.g. C-E from C-G-D-A-E), and consists of two<br/>equal whole-tones (e.g. C-E from the equal steps C-D-E).</p><p>While the term &quot;meantone&quot; historically implies narrow fifths and<br/>thirds near 5:4 and 6:5, other types of equitones old and new may<br/>feature such thirds at 81:64 and 32:27 (Pythagorean tuning), for<br/>example, or at or near 14:11 and 33:28 (a neo-Gothic favorite).[2]</p><p>From an MOS perspective, 12-note and 17-note Pythagorean tunings (the<br/>first common by the mid-14th century or so, the latter advocated in<br/>the early 15th century) are examples of how MOS does not necessarily<br/>mean &quot;closed.&quot; For a circulating Pythagorean system, we need to go to<br/>53 notes, as was reportedly recognized in China but not to my<br/>knowledge proposed in Europe before the 17th century, well after the<br/>Gothic Pythagorean era.</p><p>Likewise, what 12-note, 19-note, and 31-note meantone keyboards share<br/>is an MOS status. While Costeley (19-tET, 1570) and Salinas (1/3-comma<br/>meantone, 1577) were drawn to such a shade of meantone because of its<br/>circular features, open 19-note systems such as Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma<br/>meantone (1558) or 1/4-comma meantone (e.g. likely the Neapolitan<br/>&quot;chromatic harpsichords&quot; of around 1600 in Gb-B#) may well have been<br/>at least equally popular.</p><p>While Vicentino (1555, 1561) indeed advertises the circulating feature<br/>of his 31-note archicembalo cycle as an important advantage, his very<br/>small sampling of known enharmonic settings use no more than 24 notes<br/>in a given piece or excerpt. I&apos;m tempted to observe that 31 was the<br/>smallest MOS providing other features he needed for his music such as<br/>enharmonic dieses or fifthtones in lots of positions and new intervals<br/>such as &quot;proximate minor thirds&quot; near 11:9. The fact that 31 happens<br/>to be a &quot;virtually closed&quot; system in 1/4-comma meantone or something<br/>very close would be an additional premium.</p><p>Of course, for Fabio Colonna&apos;s &quot;example of circulation&quot; (1618), all 31<br/>notes of his _Sambuca Lincea_ were needed. However, this piece may<br/>stand out in part precisely because such circularity may be a rather<br/>tangential theme in most experimental 16th-17th century music,<br/>including chromatic and enharmonic compositions.</p><p>From Trabaci, at any rate, we know that 19-tET or the like was not an<br/>overwhelming imperative for 19-note keyboards, although musicians such<br/>as Costeley and Salinas did favor it. When Trabaci writes D#-F##-A# for<br/>an archicembalo or the like, but gives the player of a usual 19-note<br/>chromatic keyboard the option of playing D#-F#-A# with a minor third<br/>above the lowest part, he implies an open tuning, in contrast to<br/>19-tET or the like where F##=Gb and the major third would be<br/>available.</p><p>To say that discant and counterpoint in their &quot;basic&quot; form may lean<br/>toward MOS-oriented formulations is to state a tendency, not a &quot;law,&quot;<br/>much less a restraint on the growth of practice and theory alike.</p><p>For example, 13th-century theory postulates 13 or 14 generally<br/>recognized intervals ranging from unison to octave -- the intervals<br/>occurring in a 7-note diatonic Pythagorean system (fifth chain F-B).<br/>The count varies depending on whether one considers the general<br/>category &quot;tritone&quot; (_tritonus_) to include the diminished fifth, or<br/>places the latter interval in its own class, based on its distinct<br/>ratio (e.g. the _semitritonus_ of Jacobus of Liege).</p><p>However, Jacobus and Johannes Boen (c. 1357) discuss other augmented<br/>and diminished intervals also. These may have arisen in part from<br/>accidentals introduced because of such motivations as the desire to<br/>have stable consonances in more places (e.g. B-F#, F#-C#, Eb-Bb), and<br/>in part from cadential patterns prevailing by the early 14th century<br/>calling for specifically major or minor thirds and sixths in certain<br/>progressions (e.g. the major third E-G# or Eb-G before the fifth D-A).</p><p>Whatever the reasons for these accidentals, however, once they are<br/>introduced, they give rise to new kinds of intervals: the apotome or<br/>chromatic semitone Bb-B (or German B-H) is already potentially present<br/>in the usual Guidonian gamut including Bb along with the seven<br/>diatonic notes. In the early 14th century, Marchettus of Padua makes<br/>the most of this &quot;theoretical&quot; interval in very active chromatic<br/>practice, at the same time suggesting a yet greater intonational<br/>contrast between semitones in cadential progressions.</p><p>From one perspective, while Marchettus could have used the Pythagorean<br/>apotome in direct chromaticism as one feature already supported by the<br/>emerging 12-note Pythagorean MOS of the epoch, he preferred to<br/>introduce intensified cadences calling for more flavors of unstable<br/>intervals as well as semitones. Given that he was addressing vocal<br/>intonation, such refinements could be viewed as elaborations at once<br/>based on a &quot;groundwork&quot; of &quot;closest approach&quot; progressions expressible<br/>in a 12-note MOS (&quot;prefer E-G# rather than E-G before D-A&quot;), but also<br/>transforming that groundwork, giving it a new topology.</p><p>To reach an MOS providing the &quot;superefficient&quot; cadences of Marchettus<br/>for the usual diatonic cadential centers, we would need to go to 29<br/>notes, whether in something like 29-tET (with &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; to<br/>achieve pure 2:3:4 trines and 9:8 whole-tones, as vocalists might do),<br/>or in conventional Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>My own solution is a system of _two_ 12-note MOS tunings a Pythagorean<br/>comma or 29-tET diesis apart -- which I&apos;m tempted to describe in the<br/>manner of Dave Keenan&apos;s multiple &quot;chain-of-fifths&quot; tunings as a<br/>&quot;two-MOS-set&quot; tunings, both sets here generated by a single chain of<br/>fifths. Note that in such 24-note schemes, either Pythagorean or<br/>29-tET is an open tuning, although they would be precisely closed (29<br/>of 29-tET) or &quot;virtually closed&quot; (Pythagorean 53) with more notes.</p><p>Similarly, the meantone diesis of 128:125 (~41.06 cents) in 1/4-comma<br/>might originally have been viewed as more of a quirk or complication<br/>than an esteemed &quot;feature,&quot; but Vicentino made the most of it both as<br/>a new melodic interval and as a factor in differentiating new flavors<br/>of familiar intervals, vertical or melodic.</p><p>Again, while Vicentino&apos;s 31-note cycle is the smallest meantone MOS<br/>providing the enharmonic features integral to his style, I&apos;ve found<br/>that a &quot;two-MOS-sets-of-12&quot; system provides a very pleasing kind of<br/>enharmonic system with its own kind of symmetries (and some<br/>asymmetries also mirroring those of a usual 12-note meantone).</p><p>This isn&apos;t to say that Vicentino&apos;s 31 doesn&apos;t have its practical<br/>advantages apart from the possibilities of circularity. For example,<br/>unlike my 24-note &quot;dual 12-note MOS&quot; scheme, it nicely accommodates<br/>the full &quot;chromatic&quot; subset of Gb-B#, as used for example in various<br/>of his sacred and secular collections featuring compositions with<br/>13-15 notes per octave sometimes favoring D# and A#.</p><p>In open systems or closed, MOS or otherwise, counterpoint may reflect<br/>a human tendency or even irrestible inclination toward play: seeking<br/>to get &quot;useful&quot; intervals in more positions, etc., leads to more<br/>&quot;unusual&quot; intervals in the system, also, which may take on a value all<br/>their own, providing a motivation for yet further expansion of the<br/>system to get _them_ in more positions also, etc.</p><p>One complication of counterpoint systems is that they embrace many<br/>different kinds of musical phenomena at different levels, so that two<br/>notes may seem possibly &quot;equivalent&quot; for one purpose, but not for<br/>another.</p><p>For example, as you comment, Graham, notes separated by a chromatic<br/>semitone such as F/F# (the minor semitone in meantone) might have been<br/>considered as forms of the &quot;same step&quot; for _some_ purposes --<br/>specifically, in relation to the rules concerning parallels. It may be<br/>a moot question whether the successive fifths F-C, F#-C# would be<br/>considered &quot;fifths by parallel _motion_&quot; contrary to the usual<br/>16th-century rules of counterpoint (as with F#-C#, G-D), or<br/>repetitions of basically the same fifth with a change of &quot;coloring.&quot;</p><p>However, F and F# are very different notes in the sixths A-F and A-F#,<br/>with F# often being favored in theory and practice (whether written or<br/>inferred by the performers) in order to obtain the major sixth before<br/>the octave G-G. Some theorists such as Prosdocimus (1409, 1413) and<br/>Zarlino (1558) seem to say that a sixth expanding to an octave should<br/>_always_ be major, while others such as Gaffurius (1496) regard it as<br/>a general norm for significant cadences rather than for all 6-8<br/>progressions.</p><p>Vicentino (1555) says that the minor sixth expanding to the octave is<br/>&quot;gloomy,&quot; causing me to infer that he might reserve it for use with a<br/>fitting text -- possibly a hint that a famous passage in a motet of<br/>Gombert should _not_ automatically have a cadential sixth made major<br/>despite the interesting melodic figure Bb-A-G# which would result.<br/>This motet on the theme of Rachel&apos;s lament would fit Vicentino&apos;s<br/>adjective about as well as any, and the &quot;understatement&quot; of a<br/>cadential minor rather than major sixth has for me a special<br/>eloquence. Tablatures from the epoch suggest that &quot;major sixth before<br/>expansion to an octave&quot; is a usual pattern, not an absolute law.</p><p>Here I touch on some questions of accidentals mainly to illustrate how<br/>degrees a chromatic semitone apart (or enharmonic diesis, in<br/>Vicentino) might arguably be equivalent for _some_ purposes, but<br/>definitely distinguished for others.</p><p>A Spanish writer around 1540 or so discusses the use of the diminished<br/>fourth as a suspension, and Johannes Boen in 1357 treats it as an<br/>interval &quot;consonant by situation&quot; when placed above a major third.<br/>Modern counterpoint texts note the use of the augmented fifth in<br/>16th-century style between two upper parts in a combination such as<br/>D-Bb-F#, and Bernhard (around 1655?) offers a similar observation.</p><p>From the viewpoint of structural simplicity, one approach in the<br/>intonational implementation of couterpoint is to extend an equitonal<br/>tuning as far as desired in order to keep its &quot;familiar&quot; intervals and<br/>regularity of the chain of fifths while adding new intervals as well<br/>as more positions for the accustomed ones.</p><p>Both Vicentino&apos;s meantone archicembalo, and neo-Gothic Pythagorean and<br/>tempered equitones, take this basic approach.</p><p>However, even if contrapuntal theory may &quot;map&quot; most neatly to an<br/>equitonal structure where all similarly spelled intervals have<br/>identical sizes, intricate just intonation systems such as Zarlino&apos;s<br/>syntonic diatonic (from Ptolemy) are by no means excluded -- nor<br/>adaptive tuning, a subtle refinement in the very fine structure of the<br/>typology.</p><p>Similarly, considerations of economy or facility might favor using<br/>some number of notes other than an MOS: 13-16 note split-key<br/>instruments, for example, or 24-note systems which might be explained<br/>as &quot;two-12-note-MOS systems&quot; but nevertheless are distinct from usual<br/>MOS tunings such as Pythagorean 12 or 17 -- or meantone 12, 19, or 31.</p><p>To conclude, counterpoint may be seen and often heard as a kind of<br/>dialogue between symmetry and innovation, with equitonal or MOS models<br/>as a possible tendency, but by no means a rigorous constraint.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. The main qualifications to this generalization might be 17-tET or<br/>22-tET when I tune their complete sets rather than some subset<br/>(typically 12, Eb-G#), and 20-tET and 24-tET. Also, one of my favorite<br/>Pythagorean schemes is not _strictly_ &quot;regular,&quot; since the two<br/>keyboards are a septimal rather than Pythagorean comma apart in order<br/>to obtain supplementary intervals with pure 7-based ratios (e.g. 9:7,<br/>7:6, 12:7, 7:4, 8:7), but each keyboard is regular in itself and the<br/>scheme has much the same &quot;look and feel&quot; as a conventional 24-note<br/>Pythagorean tuning. I also sometimes use a 17-note neo-Gothic<br/>well-temperament, and an unequal 24-note temperament I hope to<br/>describe soon (owing lots of inspiration to 20-tET and Dan Stearns).</p><p>2. To illustrate the element of _musical usage_ in defining an<br/>equitone, I might quote from a hypothetical guidebook to neo-Gothic<br/>temperaments: &quot;A special advantage and premier feature of 46-tET is<br/>its virtually pure 14:11 major thirds, this tuning being almost<br/>identical to a 14:11 equitone; these excellent thirds are combined<br/>with rather moderately tempered fifths, about 2.39 cents wide.&quot; Such<br/>a statement reflects the simple fact that four fifths up in 46-tET are<br/>almost exactly equal to a 14:11, and the stylistic assessment that<br/>such an interval makes an excellent regular major third (a kind of<br/>variation on the usual Pythagorean 81:64). In such a setting, any<br/>convenient subset of 46-tET (or an exact 14:11 equitone) is fine: 12<br/>notes, or 13-16, or 17, or 24, etc. For styles using the same tuning<br/>to obtain some other size of major third as the &quot;normal&quot; form,<br/>however, 46-tET is not an equitone (major third from four fifths up or<br/>two equal whole-tones).</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=20680 href="#20680">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/3/2001 7:26:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

In all MOS scales there is always the closing interval called the<br/>disjunction. This interval will have in most instances a unique quality. In the major scale we<br/>have the closing fifth of b-f. It is this interval that defines to our ear just where we are in<br/>the scale. It is this area and its environs that in most cases yield the most interesting of<br/>interval shifts thus the most expressive points. In tonal music the defining of the disjunction<br/>area melodically is what pushes it toward a need for resolution. Something which would remain<br/>meaningless in an open system. Even in a solo voice, it is such dynamics that fool us into<br/>mistaking (realizing!) that we are listening to something &quot;living&quot;. Psychologically it is if a<br/>theme can represent the ego because it has &quot;identity&quot; and if this identity shifts in ways, but<br/>remains recognizable, we can relate to how this ego reacts to different circumstances. These<br/>states form within certain extremes, a range of possibilities, easily and commonly represented<br/>upon a wheel that transforms through a cycle of opposites. The Ego exists within a closed system<br/>in which a MOS scale functions as an easy catalyst for a perceived experience. I do not mean to<br/>imply that it is only the Ego that can have Identity. It is with Indian Music where we find highly<br/>refined scales (all explainable as 1st or 2nd level Moments of Symmetries) the emotional range of<br/>each scale is expanded by dealing into the intricacies of these scales. The experience is as if<br/>these emotional states were transpersonal, divine, and eternal. As if our own personal experiences<br/>of them are as if we enter them as we enter a room. We are in them as opposed to them in us.</p><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Many thanks to Margo Schulter for the very interesting article on the<br/>&gt; tendencies of counterpoint to create MOS scales.

While a split<br/>key tuning may look non-MOS at first glance, what it effectively does is allow the MOS scales to be<br/>used in more keys.

My trusty little Korg O5R/W only supports 12 note, octave repeating tunings.  Most of<br/>the horagrams don&apos;t have a ring with exactly 12 divisions.  Take horagram #2, for instance, which<br/>has a 7 segment ring followed by a 13 segment ring.

If I<br/>could get the next generation into the tuning table, another &quot;A#&quot; at +27 cents, it would provide a<br/>13 member MOS.  Obviously, the 12 tone table shown above is not MOS as a 12 tone set.  However,<br/>what it does is allow the 7 member MOS to be played starting on C, D, E, F#, G#, A#, and B (which<br/>is the 7 ring on C).</p><p>--<br/>David J.
