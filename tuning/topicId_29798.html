Main features in a 12-note regular tuning<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>Either of these almost identical tunings, like other regular<br/>temperaments in the &quot;704-cent neighborhood&quot; ranging from around 29-tET<br/>(~703.45 cents) to somewhere around the &quot;e-based temperament&quot; (~704.61<br/>cents), features mildy tempered fifths and two main families of thirds<br/>in a 12-note tuning:</p><p>            (1) Regular major and minor thirds in the general<br/>                vicinity of 11:14 and 11:13 or 28:33; and</p><p>            (2) &quot;Submajor/supraminor thirds&quot; -- actually<br/>                diminished fourths and augmented seconds --<br/>                in the vicinity of 17:21 and 14:17.</p><p>In 46-tET, the virtually just major thirds at ~11:14 are<br/>accompanied by minor thirds (11/46 octave) of around 286.96 cents,<br/>about midway between 11:13 (~289.21 cents) and 28:33 (~284.45 cents).</p><p>Submajor/supraminor thirds at around 365.22 cents (14/46 octave) and<br/>339.13 cents (13/46 octave) nicely exemplify this category, and might<br/>be described as &quot;reverse Pythagorean&quot; thirds about as far from the<br/>simplest ratios of 4:5 and 5:6 as the regular thirds of Pythagorean<br/>intonation, but in the opposite directions. This gives them an<br/>engaging and active quality inviting effective cadential resolutions.</p><p>Along with these two excellent types of thirds go very pleasant<br/>melodic qualities. Diatonic semitones are around 78 cents (3/46<br/>octave), and whole-tones around 209 cents (8/46 octave), providing<br/>melodic contrast; the compact semitones make directed cadences more<br/>efficient (e.g. major third expanding to fifth and major sixth to<br/>octave).</p><p>Chromatic semitones in 46-tET at 5/46 octave (~130.43 cents) play a<br/>very important role in resolutions of sonorities involving the<br/>submajor and supraminor thirds, often respectively expanding to fifths<br/>and contracting to unisons.</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>3. Going to 24 notes: near-7 ratios<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>While all these features are evident in a regular 12-note tuning,<br/>corresponding to a Renaissance meantone, extending the tuning to 24<br/>notes reveals some other features such as the melodic diesis and some<br/>intervals approaching ratios of 7 (2-3-7-9 odd).</p><p>Approximate ratios of 7 involve chains of 13, 14, or 15 fifths up or<br/>down, with the diesis of around 52.17 cents (2/46 octave) serving as a<br/>kind of cadential semitone for resolutions of the large major third<br/>(17/46 octave, ~443.48 cents) to a stable fifth, or of the large major<br/>sixth (36/46 octave, ~939.13 cents) to an octave, etc.</p><p>These ratios, although not as accurate as those obtainable by slightly<br/>increasing the tempering of the fifths to around 704.61 cents (~2.65<br/>cents wide), have their own &quot;mood,&quot; with the large major third having<br/>some qualities of either a 7:9 (~435.08 cents) or a more complex ratio<br/>such as 17:22 (~446.36 cents). The near-4:7 seventh of 37/46 octave at<br/>~965.22 cents (~3.61 cents narrow), and the near-6:7 of 10/46 octave<br/>at ~260.87 cents (~6.00 cents narrow), are closer to 7-based ratios.</p><p>Carrying the tuning to 24 notes also generates some other types of<br/>intervals, for example thirds at 21 fifths up or 15/46 octave (~391.30<br/>cents) and 20 fourths up or 12/46 octave (~313.04 cents), quite close<br/>to 4:5 (~386.31 cents) and 5:6 (~315.64 cents).</p><p>In an &quot;11:14 eventone&quot; approach to 46-tET, these are rather exotic<br/>intervals, occurring in a few positions in a 24-note tuning and often<br/>inviting diesis shifts to other flavors of thirds then resolving in<br/>more conventional cadences.</p><p>In other approaches to 46-tET, these intervals may be defined as the<br/>usual thirds, resulting in quite different musical approaches.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>4. A 17-note well-temperament variation<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>A regular 12-note tuning in 46-tET or an 11:14 eventone (e.g. Eb-G#)<br/>may be converted to a circulating 17-note well-temperament by adding<br/>six more &quot;remote&quot; fifths (G#-D#-A#-Gb/E#-Db/B#-Ab-F##)[1] tempered at<br/>around 1/4 of the 63:64 septimal comma (~27.26 cents), with the<br/>mathematics slightly varying depending on which system one is using.<br/>For example, with an 11:14 eventone, we might temper five of these<br/>fifths by precisely 1/4 septimal comma (708.77 cents, ~6.82 cents<br/>wide), with the last &quot;odd&quot; fifth at ~708.00 cents (~6.04 cents wide).</p><p>Here the more remote transpositions have a mood like that of 22-tET,<br/>with near-7:9 major thirds, rather heavily tempered fifths, and narrow<br/>semitones in the range of 56-60 cents (compare ~54.55 cents in 22-tET),<br/>providing an interesting contrast to the &quot;usual&quot; conditions over the<br/>nearer 12-note range.</p><p>In this kind of well-temperament, the fifths, as the main concords in<br/>a neo-Gothic kind of style, seem analogous to thirds in an<br/>18th-century well-temperament. We have mildly tempered fifths in the<br/>&quot;near&quot; part of the circle, and heavily tempered ones in the remote<br/>part of the circle, somewhat like the meantone-like and Pythagorean<br/>thirds of an historical 12-note unequal temperament.</p><p>The mixture of fifths also generates a continuum of neutral thirds and<br/>sixths, further enriching the intonational pallette.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. This spelling suggests looking at the added fifths in a sharpward<br/>direction -- we could also spell these fifths and more remote<br/>accidentals closing the circle Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-Cb/A#-Fb/D#-Bbb/G#, taking<br/>a flatward point of view.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/1/2001 12:01:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The 46-tET division is virtually identical to a regular<br/>or &quot;eventone&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning with major thirds at a pure 11:14 (~417.51 cents), with<br/>fifths<br/>&gt; at ~704.38 cents, or ~2.42 cents wide.</p><p>It seems a little strange to me to call 14/11 a major third, though<br/>from the point of view of this mapping it&apos;s a third of some kind, and<br/>not a &quot;unidecimal diminished fourth&quot;, which is what Manuel lists it<br/>as.

Why not just call it a 14/11?</p><p>Of course, &quot;14/11&quot; has the advantage of being recognizable in any<br/>musical context, and I&apos;d agree that it&apos;s the safest as well as most<br/>precise way of describing this interval in a &quot;style-independent&quot;<br/>fashion.</p><p>However, in a neo-Gothic setting, 11:14 as an eventone or 46-tET is<br/>the &quot;major third&quot; not only because it&apos;s formed from four fifths up,<br/>because it fits the stylistic category of a major third in terms of<br/>its musical qualities and function.</p><p>In neo-Gothic music, a conventional &quot;major third&quot; tends to have a size<br/>ranging from around the Pythagorean 64:81 (~407.82 cents) to around<br/>7:9 (~435.05 cents) or a bit larger. These sizes correspond with the<br/>range of regular tunings from Pythagorean (fifths pure, ~701.955<br/>cents) to 22-tET (fifths ~7.14 cents wide, ~709.09 cents).</p><p>Here 11:14 is very nicely in this range, maybe leaning a bit to the<br/>Pythagorean side.</p><p>In terms of musical &quot;function&quot; -- not in an 18th-19th century sense of<br/>&quot;functional harmony,&quot; but in terms of directed cadential action -- an<br/>11:14 third indeed serves as one ideal type of major third, very<br/>efficiently expanding to a stable fifth, just as does a Pythagorean<br/>third in usual medieval European intonation.</p><p>Thus I&apos;d say it&apos;s a neo-Gothic major third, just as a 4:5 is a<br/>Renaissance major third, or a major third in other styles where this<br/>ratio sets the norm. It&apos;s a matter of how a given style draws the map<br/>of interval categories.</p><p>This discussion reminds me of an experience a bit more than a year ago<br/>when I tuned an 11:14 eventone for the first time, and then a few days<br/>later played a bit for a close friend.</p><p>My first impressions of those 11:14 thirds were that they were sunny,<br/>bright, and beautiful; I was very happy about the tuning, and I would<br/>say the same today. Of course, part of my viewpoint might reflect my<br/>expectations for &quot;major thirds&quot; in a medieval or neo-medieval context:<br/>that they are active and often rather complex intervals, which sooner<br/>or later resolve to stable intervals such as fifths.</p><p>Then, as I mention, my friend came a few days later, and one of her<br/>first impressions, closely paraphrased, was that &quot;these are different<br/>from the &apos;thirds&apos; I&apos;ve come to expect. Thirds are supposed to be<br/>sweet, and these are &apos;dark.&apos;&quot;</p><p>This is especially interesting because I was using a rather gentle<br/>timbre which can &quot;pastelize&quot; concord/discord, as Paul and I have<br/>discussed; but my friend nevertheless found these thirds quite<br/>different than the norm.</p><p>For me, the continuum of major thirds around 11:14 or 7:9 is a<br/>wonderful universe at another energy level, a different and<br/>luminescent realm, with its own musical beauty, when compared for<br/>example to the world of Renaissance meantone near 4:5. Either realm<br/>has its own poise and beauty, but suddenly juxtaposing them can<br/>sometimes be a surprising &quot;quantum leap.&quot;</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s interesting to see this posting, as I thought of including the<br/>&gt; 29+17 system, thinking of you and knowing it would be something like<br/>&gt; this, but when I looked at the mapping of [1,21,15,11,8] it didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem so interesting. The 14/11 and 13/11 seemed a little extreme to<br/>&gt; me, but we also have some 7/5 (or 13/9) in the span of seven fifths,<br/>&gt; and out a little farther we find 13/8, 13/12, and 11/9.</p><p>Please let me admit that I need some education on how to read the<br/>matrix or array [1,21,15,11,8], so maybe this is a good opportunity<br/>for me to learn. Since I&apos;m familiar with lots of the intervals of<br/>46-tET, or of a tuning almost identical to it, this might be an ideal<br/>example to use in explaining your system.</p><p>A possibly rather wild guess: could these be numbers of fifths in a<br/>chain for certain intervals? Here 21 fifths up would be what I&apos;d<br/>consider in a neo-Gothic setting the rather &quot;exotic&quot; third at 15/46<br/>octave or about 391 cents; 15 fifths up would be the near-4:7; 11<br/>fifths up would be the augmented third quite close to 8:11; and fifths<br/>up would give what I&apos;d call a supraminor sixth or &quot;Phi-sixth&quot; very<br/>close to Phi or 21:34, and not too far from 8:13.</p><p>If I read this correctly, then your matrix shows the simplest prime<br/>ratios; in neo-Gothic music, priorities are often different.</p><p>Thus my matrix to express the main neo-Gothic families of intervals in<br/>this tuning might be [1,4,8,13]. Here 4 fifths are a usual 11:14 major<br/>third; 8 fourths or fifths, a submajor third near 17:21 or supraminor<br/>sixth near 21:34; and 13 fourths, a near-7:9 or 7-based major third.</p><p>We could also write [1,4,8,14], taking the near-6:7 minor third, 14<br/>fifths up, as characteristic of the near-7 family; this reflects the<br/>ten locations in a 24-note tuning for 7:9:12 or 6:7:9. If we&apos;re<br/>looking for a full 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24, however, then it might<br/>be best to write [1,4,8,15], telling us that these sonorities are<br/>available in nine positions of a 24-note tuning.</p><p>Likewise, if we&apos;re looking for complete submajor/supraminor sonorities<br/>of the 14:17:21 type, it might be best to write [1,4,9,15], taking the<br/>supraminor third with the longer chain of fifths -- here 9 -- as the<br/>interval of that family to use for the matrix.</p><p>If I&apos;ve understood your matrix notation correctly, I like it a very<br/>great deal, and find it a wonderful tool to show how a regular tuning<br/>for 46-tET neatly fits neo-Gothic priorities, but might not be so<br/>convenient for priorities based on simple harmonic ratios.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I comment on the 29+17 concept from my own perspective, and<br/>then on some of the specific ratios you mention.</p><p>One approach I often use in describing regular temperaments is Easley<br/>Blackwood&apos;s R, the ratio between the whole-tone and diatonic<br/>semitone. In an equal temperament, R will be a rational fraction; in<br/>other kinds of systems such as Pythagorean, it will be irrational.</p><p>For 46-tET, we have a whole-tone of 8 steps, and a diatonic semitone<br/>of 3 steps, giving us R=8/3.</p><p>Following your 29+17, we can derive R for 46-tET by combining these<br/>ratios for 29-tET (5/2) and 17-tET (3/1):</p><p>                   5   3   8<br/>                   - + - = -<br/>                   2   1   3</p><p>Thus 46-tET has an R of 8/3, or ~2.67, fitting its intermediate<br/>position on the continuum of regular or eventone temperaments at<br/>~704.35 cents, in comparison to 29-tET (~703.45 cents) and 17-tET<br/>(~705.88 cents).</p><p>Explaining Blackwood&apos;s R sets the stage for my explanation of what the<br/>&quot;e-based tuning&quot; is -- but first the ratios you mention in 46-tET.</p><p>First of all, from a neo-Gothic point of view, 11:13 and 11:14 thirds<br/>are favorite ratios, along with supraminor/submajor thirds at 14:17<br/>and 17:21, and here 46-tET is a very nice optimization for all these<br/>ratios.</p><p>The supraminor thirds and sixths of 46-tET at around 339 and 835<br/>cents, might suggest the simpler and more neutral ratios of 9:11 or<br/>8:13; but in a neo-Gothic setting, I&apos;d describe them in terms of the<br/>more complex ratios of 14:17 and 21:34, the latter quite close to Phi<br/>at ~833.09 cents.</p><p>The diminished fifths and augmented fourths or tritones, as you note,<br/>are somewhere between 5:7 and 7:10, for which we get close<br/>approximations in 29-tET; and 13:18 and 9:13, for which get fine<br/>approximations in 17-tET.</p><p>While the chromatic semitone at about 130 cents isn&apos;t too far from<br/>12:13, it&apos;s very close to 13:14 (~128.30 cents). I really like this<br/>step size, roughly a &quot;2/3-tone.&quot;</p><p>What I realize here is that how one associates 46-tET intervals with<br/>integer ratios may in part be a matter of style: one approach is to<br/>look mainly for comparatively simple ratios like 9:11 or 8:13; another<br/>is to look for more complex categories such as 14:17 or 21:34, which<br/>might be heard in many contexts more in effect as shades of<br/>temperament than as distinct relations between harmonic partials.</p><p>&gt; How does e get into it, or do you mean something other than exp(1)?</p><p>What I&apos;m actually referring to -- better understood once explained<br/>&lt;grin&gt; -- is the tuning where Blackwood&apos;s R, the ratio between<br/>whole-tone and diatonic semitone, is equal precisely to Euler&apos;s e,<br/>roughly 2.71828.</p><p>In 46-tET, R is 8/3 or ~2.67, so we&apos;re quite close to the e-based<br/>tuning. In this region, R increases along with the tempering of the<br/>fifth in the wide direction, so we need to make the fifths just a bit<br/>larger to get to Euler&apos;s e, around 704.609 cents.</p><p>When I first came up with this tuning, it was by simple curiosity and<br/>maybe a bit of intuition, having read Blackwood&apos;s discussion of R.<br/>This was in June of 2000, the same month that I was getting to know<br/>and like 29-tET.</p><p>After a few months, I came to the realization that if carried to 24<br/>notes, this e-based tuning would produce virtually pure ratios of 4:7,<br/>or 15 fifths up, and reasonably close approximations of the other<br/>ratios of 2-3-7-9.</p><p>Like 46-tET, we might write the basic families of intervals in my<br/>interpretation (however accurate) of your matrix notation,<br/>conservatively specified, as [1,4,9,15].</p><p>Note that in choosing a number of fifths for the 7-based family, I<br/>find it good &quot;conservative&quot; practice to use whichever ratio -- 7:9,<br/>6:7, or 4:7 -- requires the largest number of fifths.</p><p>Thus for Pythagorean, we might write [1,4,9,16] -- 4 fifths for the<br/>usual Pythagorean major third at 64:81; 9 fifths for the &quot;schisma<br/>minor third&quot; near 5:6; and 16 fifths for the near-7:9 major third.<br/>This last number tells us that we&apos;ll get 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 in<br/>eight locations of a 24-note tuning.</p><p>Note that with my version, the types of interval families can vary<br/>with the tuning; there isn&apos;t one fixed order set by the harmonic<br/>series or the like. Maybe one helpful cue would be to give the size of<br/>the interval in cents for each chain of fifths given in the matrix,<br/>e.g. for 46-tET: [1(704),4{418),9(339),15(965)]. For the e-based<br/>tuning, we&apos;d have [1(705),4(418),9(341),15(969)]. For Pythagorean,<br/>we&apos;d have [1(702),4(408),9(318),16(431)].</p><p>In fact, this notation is a neat way to sum up neo-Gothic families of<br/>intervals quite concisely for a given tuning! Since the size of the<br/>fifth is given first in rounded cents, we can use this to calculate<br/>the size of related intervals in a given family to the nearest cent or<br/>two. For example, for 46-tET, by taking the 7-based minor seventh at<br/>965 cents and subtracting the fifth at 704 cents, we get a near-6:7 at<br/>around 261 cents.</p><p>An important point which our dialogue may illustrate is how<br/>&quot;optimization&quot; can mean different things to different people: are we<br/>going for simple ratios, or complex ones, or some mixture? The variety<br/>of musical perspectives, together with the variety of tunings, gives<br/>this forum lots of things to keep the discussion going.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2001 2:37:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Although we&apos;ve discussed this before, perhaps some different ideas<br/>might flow if we took this up again at the present time.</p><p>My contention is that, based on my understanding of your use of them<br/>in your music, ratios like 34:21 in no way can represent<br/>audible &quot;targets&quot; toward which one might wish to optimize tuning<br/>systems. In the context in which you&apos;re using these intervals, I&apos;d<br/>say there&apos;s no qualitative difference, other than particular size,<br/>between these intervals and intervals a few cents wider or narrower.<br/>If one were to tune two notes at an interval a bit narrower than one<br/>of these ratios, and gradually increase the interval under it was a<br/>bit wider than said ratio, one would not hear anything distinct<br/>happen _at_ the ratio in question, and would not be able to<br/>distinguish the point at which the ratio was reached.</p><p>I have the fullest respect for your aesthetic goals and musical<br/>talents, but wouldn&apos;t it make more sense, and be simpler for those<br/>following along, to simply specify cents values or ranges where the<br/>intervals take on the characteristics you&apos;re interested in?

Perhaps that&apos;s incorrect, and you are<br/>fully &quot;liberated&quot; in your thought and music,  but then I&apos;d have to<br/>wonder whether your persistent reference to complex ratios that are<br/>not presented in a context where their &quot;justness&quot; could possibly be<br/>appreciated might be misleading to those less experienced than you,<br/>trying to find their way in this complex subject.</p><p>Certainly your own discussion of &quot;pastelization&quot;, and your use of 13-<br/>tET to produce effects that might be described as &quot;xeno-Gothic&quot;,<br/>points to a conceptual framework in which the simplest ratios preside<br/>over fairly large swaths of interval space, and hence (according to a<br/>harmonic entropy sort of model of consonance, with a large value of s<br/>to reflect that) there is simply no room left over for very complex<br/>ratios to represent anything but arbitrarily selected points upon a<br/>gradually changing continuum.</p><p>I&apos;ll leave it at that for now and hope you will understand that this<br/>is simply intended to provoke discussion, particularly from some of<br/>our newer members, and not intended to denigrate your wonderful work<br/>and incredible contributions to this list in any way.</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>11/1/2001 5:22:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, in a neo-Gothic setting, 11:14 as an eventone or 46-tET is<br/>&gt; the &quot;major third&quot; not only because it&apos;s formed from four fifths up,<br/>&gt; because it fits the stylistic category of a major third in terms of<br/>&gt; its musical qualities and function.</p><p>If you had two circles of 46-et fifths a tritone apart, you end up<br/>with both of these.

Here I&apos;ll actually take as my example a somewhat different<br/>tuning in the same general region of the spectrum which might be of<br/>special interest to you in regard to some of the ratios were were<br/>discussing.</p><p>While 46-tET has rather close ratios of 5, an even closer, I might say<br/>&quot;near-just,&quot; approximation occurs in the Erv Wilson/Keenan Pepper<br/>tuning with fifths at around 704.096 cents, so that the ratio between<br/>the chromatic and diatonic semitones is equal to Phi (~1.618). This<br/>has come to be called the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning.</p><p>From my perspective, the &quot;usual&quot; major third of this tuning is the<br/>regular one at around 416.38 cents, quite close to 11:14 (~417.51<br/>cents). Additionally there are diminished fourths or submajor thirds<br/>at around 367.24 cents, large major thirds at ~446.76 cents, and also,<br/>more remotely, &quot;schisma-like&quot; thirds at ~386.01 cents, only about 0.31<br/>cents narrow of a just 4:5 (~386.31 cents).</p><p>(The term &quot;schisma-like&quot; refers to a certain resemblance between these<br/>thirds and Pythagorean schisma thirds -- diminished fourths and<br/>augmented seconds -- very close to ratios of 5, differing from them by<br/>what I call the &quot;3-5 schisma&quot; of 32805:32768, ~1.95 cents. Pythagorean<br/>schisma thirds have ratios of 8196:6561 or ~384.36 cents, and<br/>19683:16384 or ~317.60 cents.)</p><p>Here the order of presenting these thirds reflects my own usual<br/>musical priorities, but from a 5-limit or higher n-limit kind of<br/>perspective of the kind which your analysis often seems to imply, the<br/>near-4:5 category might well get the highest priority.</p><p>From a 5-limit perspective, in fact, we get an approximation of 4:5:6<br/>at around 0-386.01-704.10, with a minor third of ~318.09 cents, about<br/>2.45 cents wide; the fifth is about 2.14 cents wide.</p><p>Now we come to your interesting question: &quot;What do you do with this<br/>kind of mixture of thirds in a tuning?&quot;</p><p>Here what one _might_ do could have many answers, in fact as many<br/>answers as there are musical viewpoints among the people responding to<br/>the question. What I&apos;ll try to share is what I have done in this kind<br/>of situation, or at least in the type where this tuning is presented<br/>in a regular 24-note arrangement.</p><p>First, of course, it&apos;s possible to &quot;throw in&quot; a 0-386-704 or 0-318-704<br/>sonority here and there as a kind of coloristic element, without any<br/>immediate sense direction: the music continues in one way or another,<br/>having been varied by a bit of a diversion. Sometimes this is more or<br/>less my attitude toward the supraminor sixth or &quot;Phi-sixth&quot; found in<br/>the general region around 833 cents, although both with that interval<br/>and the intervals we&apos;re discussing now I often to have some kind of<br/>cadential &quot;bridge&quot; back to more usual intervals.</p><p>One cadential approach I like, and which can also apply with the two<br/>major thirds of 22-tET at around 382 and 436 cents, is to use a<br/>&quot;schisma-like&quot; or near-4:5 third in this kind of three-sonority<br/>progression, with an asterisk (*) showing a note raised by a diesis or<br/>&quot;12-comma&quot; of about 49.15 cents in the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning:</p><p>  Bb3   C4  D4         C4    D4  E4          C4    D4  Eb4<br/>  F#*3  G3  A3         G#*3  A3  B3          G#*3  A3  Bb3<br/>  Eb3       D3    or   F3        E3    or    F3        Eb3</p><p>Here we start with a 0-386-704 sonority, and have the middle voice<br/>shift by a &quot;subdiesis&quot; or &quot;17-comma&quot; of about 30.38 cents to the<br/>regular 416-cent major third while the upper voice moves from the<br/>fifth to the regular 912.29-cent major sixth. From there, we have a<br/>usual resolution to 0-704-1200 cents, with directed progressions of<br/>major third to fifth and major sixth to octave.</p><p>(Note: the &quot;17-comma&quot; is the difference between 17 fifths and 10 octaves,<br/>the comma dispersed in 17-tET.)</p><p>This can also be done in 22-tET, where both the interval for the shift<br/>in the middle voice (a kind of diesis resembling 35:36 or ~48.77<br/>cents, the difference between 4:5 and 7:9) and the usual diatonic<br/>semitone (maybe in effect a tempered 27:28, ~62.96 cents) are equal to<br/>1/22 octave or ~54.55 cents:</p><p>C4  D4 E4        C4  D4 Eb4<br/>G#3 A3 B3        G#3 A3 Bb3<br/>F3     E3   or   F3     Eb3</p><p>Here we have, in rounded cents, a &quot;schisma-like&quot; sonority at<br/>0-382-709, a regular (or, as Paul Erlich often says, &quot;Pythagorean&quot;)<br/>cadential sonority of 0-436-927 cents, and a usual resolution to<br/>0-709-1200.</p><p>Returning to the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning, there&apos;s another treatment of<br/>0-386-704 cents that I very much like, here involving the shift of a<br/>diesis or &quot;12-comma&quot; in the middle voice (~49.15 cents):</p><p>  Bb3        B4<br/>  F#*3  F#3  E3<br/>  Eb3        E3</p><p>Here the 0-386-704 sonority moves by a downward diesis shift of the<br/>middle voice, F#*3-F#3, to a usual supraminor/submajor third sonority<br/>at 0-337-704 cents, with a standard progression with the outer voices<br/>each ascending by a chromatic semitone so that the three voices arrive<br/>at a stable fifth.</p><p>One might interpret the diesis, in this context, as approximating the<br/>34:35 difference (~50.18 cents) between a 14:17 supraminor third<br/>(~336.13 cents) and a 4:5 third.</p><p>An important point here is that how one handles mixed thirds in this<br/>or other tunings is largely a question of style. Similarly, how one<br/>approaches such concepts as the sizes of &quot;diatonic&quot; and &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>semitones, or of &quot;whole-tones,&quot; is also a matter of musical style, and<br/>maybe also of &quot;intonational&quot; style insofar as one may have preferences<br/>regarding tuning structures as they relate to a given type of music.</p><p>For example, as you observe, if one is using 46-tET in a 5-limit or<br/>higher n-limit kind of setting (meaning that ratios of 5 are taken as<br/>having a primary role), then it is natural to view the &quot;diatonic<br/>semitone&quot; as 4 steps, a kind of &quot;15:16,&quot; and the &quot;whole-tone&quot; as an<br/>interval of either 7 or 8 steps, with these unequal steps together<br/>forming a near-5:4 third of 15 steps.</p><p>In this type of setting, Blackwood&apos;s R may not strictly be applicable,<br/>at least in the most obvious way as a guide to the usual<br/>characteristics of melody and verticality or harmony. The R concept<br/>compares the &quot;regular&quot; whole-tone (two fifths up) and diatonic<br/>semitone (five fourths up), not necessarily the most relevant<br/>relationships for a musical application more closely suggesting the<br/>syntonic diatonic than a meantone or eventone.</p><p>(Meantone tunings are a subset of eventone tunings. In meantone<br/>tunings, four fifths up approximate 4:5 more or less closely; in<br/>eventone tunings, more generally, four fifths up approximate the<br/>&quot;usual&quot; major third in a given style, for example ~11:14 in 46-tET or<br/>the Noble Fifth tuning. Thus whether or not a regular tuning is an<br/>&quot;eventone&quot; may be partly in the eyes or ears of the user in a given<br/>stylistic context.)</p><p>From my perspective, however, R is a very convenient yardstick, since<br/>the regular steps are the most common ones in a neo-Gothic kind of<br/>style. Thus &quot;R=8/3&quot; describes the regular diatonic scale quite fitting<br/>for my usual purposes, with diesis or subdiesis shifts providing a<br/>variety of melody and vertical &quot;flavor&quot; alike, but seen as pleasant<br/>excursions from a basic eventone structure.</p><p>Indeed, such tunings in this kind of neo-medieval style are analogous<br/>to me to a Renaissance meantone: both systems avoid comma<br/>complications for the &quot;usual diatonic scale,&quot; but offer different kind<br/>of diesis or sometimes also smaller intervals sometimes used as direct<br/>melodic steps, and often used to distinguish different &quot;flavors&quot; of<br/>the same general categories of vertical intervals and sonorities.</p><p>Thus if I&apos;m looking for a &quot;usual&quot; major third around 4:5, I tend to<br/>tune meantone; for a &quot;usual&quot; 11:14 major third, I tune an eventone<br/>yielding this ratio for four fifths up (less two octaves), arriving at<br/>something almost identical to 12-of-46-tET or 24-of-46-tET, etc.</p><p>From my perspective, either R=~1.65 for 1/4-comma meantone, or R=8/3<br/>for 46-tET, is musically as well as theoretically the measure of a<br/>&quot;usual diatonic scale.&quot;</p><p>However, from other perspectives, other measures might be more<br/>relevant -- for example, the 5-limit steps you have suggested for<br/>46-tET.</p><p>What one does, and how one defines the intervals used to do it, may be<br/>a matter of both musical style (what sizes of thirds best fit a given<br/>style?) and intonational style (the contrast between meantone/eventone<br/>and &quot;syntonic diatonic&quot; approaches, etc.).</p><p>Communication about musical and intonational assumptions alike can<br/>sometimes be a patient process, especially when the assumptions may<br/>take a while to clarify on all sides. Thank you for taking an interest<br/>in this kind of process, and for your most generous contributions to<br/>this and other forums of our tuning community.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
