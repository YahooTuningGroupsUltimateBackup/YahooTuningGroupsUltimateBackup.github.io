We have no single remark by Bach himself (like on temperaments). In the case of intonation we have however an unanimous body of evidence from the above mentioned sources, allowing to conclude with a rather high likeliness, that Bach would not differ from, what all the other authors confirm. When you&apos;ll study them carefully, you&apos;ll find it. Fortunately it is one of the questions in which all these authors agree. (Only the depth of their different presentations form a difference in this respect)</p><p>&gt; Every example I have found of an opening perfect fifth<br/>&gt; in a  melody in Bach begins on a flattened 696 cent<br/>&gt; fifth when there is a harpsichord.</p><p>Judgement from the music is judgement from personal preference - we don&apos;t need to take it up again and again. Let&apos;s boar the list with something more well-founded than personal preferences.</p><p>&gt;  If a harpsichord exists for 95 percent of all music,<br/>&gt; it seems</p><p>Yes it seems, but that feeling will vanish as soon as you&apos;ll collect some thorough experience in this field.</p><p>Forms of synchrone, &quot;dual&quot; intonation are quite natural. They occur basically everywhere all the time, also in any somehow tempered keyboard instrument:  its the partials with/contra the temperament or other type of intonation.<br/>Partials in a harpsichord (if you use a strong sounding, historical type) can be well heard at times and tuning and tempering is guided by them - also the choice of temperament has much to do with the individual harpsichord available. In order to let the instrument sound highly  resonant it is very useful to listen and to know the instrument before deciding which temperament system and temp-style is appropriate.  Pre-cooked recipes, like Werckmeister III, Kirnberger III are of course good starts to practice for a beginner. A given temperament can create a dull in one instrument a very bright (may be too bright) sound in others. Listen, listen , listen - and train your ear.</p><p>Now, if you compare the organ for example:<br/>it contains of course also &quot;dual intonation&quot; at the same time -   similar to an ensemble until ca 1800 (or even later).  The composite stops and mixtures (octaves and fifths, sometimes thirds) are tuned as perfectly pure as possible,  while XY-temperament produces AT THE SAME TIME different fifths, and in case of WT and ET also different third-sizes.  In meantone the third ranks will form a most harmonious effect with the pure thirds sounding from the temperament, while in all WTs and in ET the pure tuned third-ranks often will not sound very ok, but it depends also on the voicing of the stops and the acoustics of the room and the organ inside (the thirds are more sensitive in this respect, also usually high-pitched)  Occurence of third rank stops is btw way one reason, which points to meantone, when other evidence also is available.</p><p>In an ensemble it works similar:<br/>-  The keyboard instruments and possible other fixed-pitched<br/>   instruments (lutes, theorbos, gambas, etc) will and must<br/>   have a temperament<br/>-  the free-intonating instruments form the pure &quot;mixtures&quot;.</p><p>The bass, which is reinforced by low strings and woodwinds (dulcian, fagotto), &quot;clean up&quot; the harmony, which is always least in the tempered instruments. This effect can be heard in an organ when a strong, yet fundamental reed stop is drawn together with amongst others a mixture - it can subtract lots of &quot;sharpness&quot; from the all-together sound and is an quite amazing   effect!</p><p>&gt; an error to treat solos as if<br/>&gt; they are from a different planet of intonation.</p><p>They are not from a different planet, and the laws of physics would work on the othare planets to (partials etc.  see above.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;This is valid for the flute, other woodwinds, string &gt;&gt;instruments, singers - which we today all to sldom (most people &gt;&gt;never get to hear it, because normally musicians are not &gt;&gt;trained, nor can their teachers teach it) or other free &gt;&gt;intonating instrument (i. e. an instrument, which does allow &gt;&gt;enough flexibility to reach the &quot;correct&quot; intonation, according &gt;&gt;to the principles valid for 18th century performanc<br/>&gt;&gt;Good success,<br/>&gt;&gt;Ibo Ortgies</p><p>&gt; This would be valid for playing Vivaldi, and some other<br/>&gt; Baroque composers.<br/>&gt; However, since you asked specifically about Bach, it is<br/>&gt; toward the enharmonic that intonation is based.</p><p>As one can learn from the sources again, the intonation is not constructed around the concept of the genera (diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic): each interval is treated according to its &quot;natural ratio&quot; (i.e. the lowest fraction represented in the overtone series - the 7th partial is btw only seldom adressed, for example by Kirnberger).</p><p>&gt; Frankly, as a solo flute work, it will be challenging for<br/>&gt; most anyone to hear the difference between any of these<br/>&gt; approaches.

But already the best major thirds beat audibly fast (contrary to the pure meantone temperaments), getting worse with with each next step away from c.   Minor chords are slightly less sensitive (a and e are the same, but also quickly depart from anything neaar meantone.<br/>And since you&apos;ll have E-major as &quot;dominant&quot; and related chords on the sharp side you&apos;ll get a lot of chords worse than even ET.</p><p>&gt; (as opposed to Bb minor).</p><p>&gt; Have fun with the solo, foremost.  best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>I wish that too: It is not up to me to make artitic decisions for others.</p><p>From a merely artistic standpoint of course you can choose against the clear and long published evidence from the 18th century and try instead to follow the modern ideas and style experiments, Johnny Reinhard is working on.</p><p>But, like on temperament, we have not one single statement<br/>from Bach himself about ensemble intonation, but plenty of<br/>other close sources, as I mentioned.<br/>If you want to perform Bach as close to the ascertainable practice of his time , then the harmonic intonation (&quot;as pure as possible&quot;) which I sketched from the source info, will be your choice.

They are the easiest to follow, because they are<br/>more likely in a audible range.<br/>It is important that the bass line is overtone rich enough at<br/>the place where the accompanied instrument or singer stands.<br/>This sometimes forms a problem, for example when only a<br/>fundamental sounding continuo instrument is resent, like a too<br/>weak continuo positive - a performer stand ing besides it will<br/>most likely not hear the bass clear enough (only its octaves (if<br/>doubled in the chord).<br/>A 17th century solution was to use a Regal (small reed organ),<br/>which produces a very overtone rich spectrum - rather easy to<br/>blend in. And the fundamental might be not very strong in every<br/>place (anway a Violone etc. was employed), but the higher<br/>overtones of the bass enabled that even if the singer/player is<br/>standing close to such an instrument, that he can orient himself<br/>to the bass line.<br/>The same is true for the northern german organs with its rich<br/>reed &quot;instrumentation&quot;, especially in the divisions most often<br/>used for the &quot;Music&quot;, which is frequently a term for &quot;ensemble<br/>music&quot; - until now often misinterpreted as referring to music in<br/>general.  This principle of using strong overtone-rich, continuo<br/>keyboards worked better in a meantone surrounding: especially by<br/>reed stops,which produce very audible thirds (and of course<br/>often other patials high up are well perceptable, 7th, 9th .. -<br/>however it is the art of the organ builder not to get them too<br/>much sticking out).  Note that for example Buxtehude bought a<br/>&quot;double 16-foot regal&quot; for the performances in St. Marien,<br/>L&uuml;beck. Both church and the still existing regal were destroyed<br/>in 1942 - only the church has been reconstructed, except of its<br/>interior. However, no one until now, made an attempt to<br/>reconstruct .&apos;s regal and see what it&apos;s use was in the large<br/>&quot;Abendmusiken&quot;, public ensemble performances of a long tradition<br/>in L&uuml;beck-Marien (s. the research by Kerala Snyder).<br/>In the large acoustics of this gigantic hanseatic cathedral the<br/>bass reinforcement by a overtone rich 16-foot instrument can be<br/>expected to have been of crucial. I have noted that in gothic<br/>architecture the tenor/lower alto range are often stressed, as<br/>well as quints - may be that reflects the medieval-renaissance<br/>use of tenor-oriented music and use of pure fifths based tunings<br/>(like pythagorean). Later rooms of th early  renaisssance or the<br/>Baroque often seem to be somewhat more neutral or even<br/>bass-friendly and third-friendly. (But this is a personal<br/>observation which I would really like to know whether it could<br/>be backed up by acoustical research). Smaller but older rooms<br/>also got more &quot;packed&quot; with interior, changing older room<br/>acoustics probably considerably.<br/>The large North German churches in which meantone temperament<br/>was used far into the 18th century usually employed not only an<br/> organist, but one or two Regal-players (for example in<br/>Hamburg, L&uuml;beck, Bremen)!  The use of such stops/regals was<br/>rather restricted to work in music, which doesn&apos;t extend to<br/>remote keys too much. In the time after ca. 1700, when ensemble<br/>music more and more used remote keys, the regals got less<br/>popular, and even the organ, which were for other social and<br/>liturgical reasons keeping meantone temperament, was considered as<br/>I have for example one printed source by one of the best known<br/>authors, relevant to our discussion (era and regions) published<br/>around 1750, which says &apos;we have begun to abandon the us of<br/>regals, organ positives and organs now&apos;, because of the problem<br/>of the temperament of such instruments.<br/>Of course a regal or a reed stop, can be tuned to any<br/>temperament, but a well-tempered or ET-tuned regal, with its<br/>strong overtone rich sound is not a highly helpful tool in<br/>guiding an intonation, according the &quot;old&quot; principles.</p><p>That brings me to the &quot;contra&quot;,  to the partials of the tempered<br/>intervals in the fixed pitch instruments (keyboard instruments<br/>etc.), which are differing according to the degree of each<br/>tempered interval in them. As the the chords are by definition<br/>above the so important bass line, the partials of the higher notes of the chords will be tend to be less perceptible (that is<br/>also a basic voicing principle, however adapation to individual<br/>room acoustics have been and should be made). The more distant<br/>the player and even more the public will be from such a continuo<br/>keyboard, the less perceived is this cloud of partials coming<br/>&quot;from the temperament&quot;. Otherwise masking by the other (melodic)<br/>bass instruments will merciful mask the effect of tempered out-of-tune intervals.</p><p>Just a small experience (I can tell only from that)<br/>In December I took part in a performance of Bachs Magnificat and<br/>stood above the positive organ (well-tempered, J&auml;germeister XY,<br/>who cares) and got all the nasty F#-major and other bad sounding<br/>chords around my ears, but for intonating I needed only to<br/>listen to the strong sound of the Violone or the Cello, some<br/>meters away, effectively taking away lots of the effect the<br/>weird tempered-harmonies. And the who&ouml;e took part in a merciless<br/>dry acoustics, nothing to disguise.<br/>As I said before, is seems not without reason, that it is called<br/>BASSO [and] CONTINUO (once a seguente), and not basso ARMONICO<br/>or basso RITMICO.</p><p>Very simplistic (but hopefully practical - as I was talking<br/>about thumb rules):</p><p>- with: the partials of the pure tuned intervals of<br/>  a temperament. In meantone is only the pure major<br/>  thirds, in some WTs it is a bunch of pure fifths.<br/>  Their partials at the same pitch are ideally in<br/>  tune with each other.</p><p>- contra: the out of tune intervals in each temperament<br/>  and their partials against the afore-mentioned</p><p>&gt; Are you talking about inharmonic partials,</p><p>No, I&apos;m talking about the partials which you can hear and use in<br/>a &quot;practical&quot; situation, like performing a motet, a cantata or<br/>instrumental ensemble music from the time in question. The<br/>playing/performing situation has too many factors, which hinder<br/>(I think it is fortunate) the perception of such minor<br/>deviations, which might be measured or even heard for example in<br/>a test rig in an acoustical lab.  Deviations of in the magnitude<br/>of 1-2 cents are practically neglegible (that&apos;s why the<br/>differences of different WTs are so marginal towards for<br/>ensemble performance).</p><p>In the audible range in harpsichords and similar instruments the<br/>partials are so close to the theoretical exact partials, that<br/>the difference is neglegible for practice. They approach the<br/>&quot;ideal&quot; series of partials, because tension and thickness of the<br/>strings are rather low (compare to a modern grand ...). amy be a<br/>slightly less, but certainly</p><p>Which partial(s) you can hear depends on too many factors, where<br/>you stand, the room and how partials are reflected (or not) and<br/>dispersed from the walls, even if your move your head you might<br/>&quot;lose&quot; a partial.  That is not to control when you at the same<br/>time try to concentrate on the music. Has a lot to do with<br/>learning to listen, adapt, automatizing. The more everyone<br/>intonates &quot;correct&quot;, the more you can fit in your voice or<br/>instrument into the narrower bandwidth of sounds and its<br/>partials.  It will not happen all of the time during a<br/>performance and it doesn&apos;t even need to, most important are that<br/>the cadences and longer sounding chords get the best of it (Yes,<br/>I agree, I&apos;m also not content with my description here, but I<br/>think ensemble intonation is still a rather unresearched item -<br/>too complex, may be)</p><p>&gt; and if so how close do you need to come,</p><p>as close as possible:<br/>it is the usual struggle to reach perfection (or against<br/>&apos;chaos&apos;, if you want - everyone has a different view on that),<br/>which can&apos;t be won - and still we try it again and again. May be<br/>that&apos;s what art is about (or some parts of art)?</p><p>&gt; and which partials should concern you?</p><p>The easiest to hear are usually the fifths (3, 6) or the third<br/>(5). Octaves get easier soaked up, even if the are rather strong<br/>in a sound.</p><p>&gt; If you are<br/>&gt; thinking of the amplitude and decay of partials,<br/>&gt; how do you relate that to temperament?</p><p>I can&apos;t give numbers and  already when one might turn the head<br/>one might hear a certain partial less, another comes in more<br/>clear, etc., maybe because that particular partial is reflected<br/>from some wall - whatever. So the thumb rule is (for me): as<br/>soon as one detects a stronger partial (much more likely from<br/>the basses, fortunately) take it and let it guide you.<br/>Admittedly, the practice will show, that this doesn&apos;t work all<br/>the time - humans are too imperfect, sometimes, tire,<br/>unconcentrated ...</p><p>&gt;&gt;Partials in a harpsichord (if you use a strong<br/>&gt;&gt;sounding, historical type) can be well heard at times<br/>&gt;&gt;and tuning and tempering is guided by them - also the<br/>&gt;&gt;choice of temperament has much to do with the individual<br/>&gt;&gt;harpsichord available.</p><p>Just an example:  If a performer asks me (as has happened from<br/>time to time) to tune his harpsichord for a concert, I approach<br/>it as follows if time and circumstances allow</p><p>- take as much time as you really need and add one hour<br/>  for unexpected things (its real &quot;beasts&quot; we are dealing<br/>  with)</p><p>- analyze the music to be played: which notes occur, which<br/>  chords are the longest sounding, which notes could stand<br/>  a more or less &quot;septimal&quot; intonation (more often disguised<br/>  in chords, than in melodic progression).</p><p>- The order of the pieces in the concert (including possibly<br/>  a prepared &quot;encore&quot;) is important, as the last<br/>  chord should not sound like a mess. It is not the task in<br/>  earlier music to let the listener go away with &quot;sour milk&quot;.<br/>  Some years in Italy I tuned for a concert in which someone<br/>  played the two Bach-partitas in c-minor and D-major. The<br/>  last chord of the concert was D-major. After the concert<br/>  experienced musicians came and said, that they never heard<br/>  such a good temperament in Bach and what temperament I used.<br/>  Of course their friendly statement was exagggerating, because<br/>  it was not so much the specific instrument in that case, but<br/>  th careful planning of the sound of last chord, which stays<br/>  in the memory of the listeners: They all forgot about that<br/>  the first half of the concert was rather &quot;bitter&quot;. It helped,<br/>  that the more frequent minor chords were not as sensitive<br/>  as in the D-major-partita.   If the c-minor piece would<br/>  have been at the end, I had designed the temperament very<br/>  different.</p><p>- Then - if one knows the instrument or has time to try it<br/>  play it through. Detect where torsion of strings or other<br/>  factors might lead to a modification or change of<br/>  temperament concept. You might start from Werckmeister or<br/>  another temperament suiting that specific music after you<br/>  have analyzed the music. And end up in the real situation<br/>  with something already quite different - because you adjust<br/>  temperaments to the context!<br/>  Finally it is not the temperament system which counts,<br/>  but the sounding result.</p><p>- Last and very important: the octaves must be perfect.<br/>  Most successful is to control them in two-octave-distance!<br/>  Most harpsichord recordings are hopeless in this.<br/>  May be the artists or tone engineers think that no one<br/>  hears that? And 4&apos; stops are especially often annoying, not<br/>  only because their often screaming voicing, but especially<br/>  because they transmit sloppiness in tuning the octaves<br/>  even more. May be the Italian listeners appreciated even<br/>  more my efforts to try to set the octaves really exact?</p><p>20 years ago I tuned a harpsichord for Bach&apos;s A-major<br/>harpsichord  concerto. If I remember right (I don&apos;t have the<br/>score here right now) the middle movement uses one or two<br/>B-flats and F-s.  I designed a meantone based temperament,<br/>modified only for the A# (as &quot;usable&quot; B-flat) and E# (as<br/>&quot;usable&quot; F). Worked fantastic, I never have heard such a<br/>wonderful interaction of chords and intervals in a Bach-concerto<br/>again. Unfortunately, that lasted only until the small ensemble<br/>came in, using a fretted bass instrument. They honestly adjusted<br/>as much as the could, but it was not highly succesful in that.<br/>I&apos;m still feeling guilty...</p><p>&gt;&gt;In order to let the instrument<br/>&gt;&gt;sound highly  resonant it is very useful to listen<br/>&gt;&gt;and to know the instrument before deciding which<br/>&gt;&gt;temperament system and temp-style is appropriate.</p><p>&gt; What specific physical factors underlie such a choice?</p><p>I don&apos;t know, as I&apos;m neither a physicist, nor have seen any<br/>studies.  My statement was derived from my experience with<br/>different harpsichords over years of tuning and listening. There<br/>is a lot of research on single instrument acoustical problems,<br/>also in harpsichords.   But I doubt that  the individual harpsichords and the interaction of its parts are researched<br/>from a &quot;holistic&quot; perspective.  It is about plucked strings,<br/>pins, bridges, soundboard, case,  with different materials, even<br/>inhomogenous, varying density (wood). Plus torsion (strings),<br/>elasticity of inhomogenous materials,  two- and three<br/>dimensional waves in such material, damping ...</p><p>Probably builders and some players know more about that from<br/>practice, than physical research might be able to reveal.<br/>Nonetheless, a wide-scope and interdisciplinary project to<br/>narrow in the problems would be highly wishful.</p><p>kind regards</p><p>Ibo Ortgies</p></div><h3>springswood &#x3C;springswood@yahoo.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2003 5:32:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well,<br/>Thanks very much, that&apos;s given me loads to work on.
