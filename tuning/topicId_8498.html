Feb. 16, 8PM at Christ &amp; St. Stephen&apos;s Church, 120 W. 69th St., NYC.<br/>Tickets only $12.00, $7.00 students, and TDF vouchers are accepted.</p><p>I won&apos;t post a press release unless someone is interested, and then I will<br/>forward it to them.  However we will be featuring John Zorn&apos;s _Carny_, a<br/>wild and challenging piece for piano, and we have several composers coming<br/>from out of town, including Laura Kaminsky (a guitar piece) from Seattle,<br/>and David Bernstein (clarinet &amp; pno) from OH.</p><p>Of particular note to the xenharmonically inclined will be Richard<br/>Felciano&apos;s _Dark Landscapes_ for English horn which makes extensive use of<br/>multiphonics and extended techniques on the instrument.  Felciano is noted<br/>for his work in electronic music and in alternate tunings, and these<br/>influences are evidenced in all his work, but particularly in this tune.</p><p>Hope to see you there,  (free food, too!)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>P.S.
