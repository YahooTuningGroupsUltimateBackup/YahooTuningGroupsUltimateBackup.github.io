In particular, the key<br/>names for the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th<br/>signatures in the left column should be<br/>switched with the key names for the 2nd, 4th,<br/>6th, 8th, and 10th signatures in the right<br/>column, respectively. Since no one&apos;s noticed<br/>this before, I take it no one is likely to get<br/>confused by it soon . . . but I&apos;ll be sure to get<br/>a note into the Xenharmonikon Errata page,<br/>and hopefully Carl will help me get a<br/>corrected .pdf or .html version of the paper<br/>up on Starrett&apos;s site.</p></div>
