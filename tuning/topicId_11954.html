If, for example, Jupiter and the<br/>Sun are the two massive bodies, these stable configurations occur when the<br/>mean motions of Jupiter and the small particle--here an asteroid--are near a<br/>ratio of small integers. The orbital mean motions are then said to be nearly<br/>commensurate, and an asteroid that is trapped near such a mean motion<br/>commensurability is said to be in an orbital resonance with Jupiter. For<br/>example, the Trojan asteroids librate (oscillate) around the 1:1 orbital<br/>resonance (i.e., the orbital period of Jupiter is in a 1:1 ratio with the<br/>orbital period of the Trojan asteroids); the asteroid Thule librates around<br/>the 4:3 orbital resonance; and several asteroids in the Hilda group librate<br/>around the 3:2 orbital resonance. There are several such stable orbital<br/>resonances among the satellites of the major planets and one involving the<br/>planets Pluto and Neptune. The analysis based on the restricted three-body<br/>problem cannot be used for the satellite resonances, however, except for the<br/>4:3 resonance between Saturn&apos;s satellites Titan and Hyperion, since the<br/>participants in the satellite resonances usually have comparable masses.</p><p>Although the asteroid Griqua librates around the 2:1 resonance with Jupiter,<br/>and Alinda librates around the 3:1 resonance, the orbital commensurabilities<br/>2:1, 7:3, 5:2, and 3:1 are characterized by an absence of asteroids in an<br/>otherwise rather highly populated, uniform distribution spanning all of the<br/>commensurabilities. These are the Kirkwood gaps in the distribution of<br/>asteroids, and the recent understanding of their creation and maintenance<br/>has introduced into celestial mechanics an entirely new concept of<br/>irregular, or chaotic, orbits in a system whose equations of motion are<br/>entirely deterministic.</p><p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:gbms01.uwgb.edu/~dutchs/planets/resonan">http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:gbms01.uwgb.edu/~dutchs/planets/resonan</a><br/>c.htm+orbital+resonances&amp;hl=en:<br/>Certain resonances seem to enhance orbital stability by locking bodies in<br/>step in such a way they avoid conflict. 3:2 resonances seem to be especially<br/>effective.

Here it is:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/Solar2.mid">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/Solar2.mid</a></p><p>There&apos;s not a lot of difference, but to my ears, this version is<br/>a bit more strident, and brings out the &apos;major chord&apos; quality<br/>of the orbital-period ratios even more strongly.</p><p>Thru my speakers, I can&apos;t hear Pluto or Neptune at all, and<br/>can just barely discern Uranus at the bottom and Mercury at<br/>the top when I turn off all the other planets.  I&apos;ll leave<br/>these four planets out of my analysis.</p><p>The &apos;major chord&apos; effect is due mainly to Saturn, Jupiter, and<br/>Venus, with Mars reinforcing Saturn 4 &apos;8ves&apos; higher.  Earth<br/>adds most of the piquancy with a pseudo-&apos;major 7th&apos;.</p><p>So the aural effect (at least as I hear it; &apos;your mileage may<br/>vary&apos;) causes Saturn to sound as the 1/1 - it is actually almost<br/>exactly 3 &apos;8ves&apos; and a 135/128 5-limit &apos;semitone&apos;, or what Ellis<br/>called the &apos;larger limma&apos; (92 cents), above the inaudible Pluto.</p><p>Jupiter is 1 &apos;8ve&apos; and 375 cents higher than Saturn - only<br/>~11 cents narrower than an &apos;8ve&apos; + 5/4.</p><p>Mars is about 37 cents below the 4th &apos;8ve&apos; above Saturn.  It&apos;s<br/>also 2 &apos;8ves&apos; and 788 cents above Jupiter.</p><p>Earth is 4 &apos;8ves&apos; and 1057 cents above Saturn - pretty close<br/>to one of my favorite intervals, an 11/6 &apos;neutral 7th&apos; (= 1049<br/>cents).  To my ears, the more important audible relationship is<br/>that between Mars and Earth: 1094 cents, only ~6 cents wider than<br/>a 15/8 &apos;major 7th&apos;.  I think this stands out quite strongly in<br/>the chord.  Earth is also 3 &apos;8ves&apos; + 682 cents above Jupiter.</p><p>Venus is very high and bright, almost exactly a 13/8 above Earth<br/>(altho to my ears it really sounds a lot like an 8/5 &apos;minor 6th&apos;),<br/>an &apos;8ve&apos; + 735 cents above Mars, 4 &apos;8ves&apos; + 323 cents above<br/>Jupiter (pretty close to a 6/5 &apos;minor 3rd&apos;), and 5 &apos;8ves&apos; +<br/>698 cents (a nice meantone &apos;5th&apos;!) above Saturn.</p><p>Here&apos;s the more accurate data, which supercedes the tables in<br/>my original post:</p><p>            Orbital period<br/>            days       years</p><p>Mercury    87.969     0.24084<br/>Venus     224.701     0.615187<br/>Earth     365.256363  1.0<br/>Mars      686.98      1.8808<br/>Jupiter  4332.71     11.8621<br/>Saturn               29.458<br/>Uranus               84.01<br/>Neptune             164.79<br/>Pluto               248.54</p><p>The figure given for the Earth&apos;s orbital period is known as<br/>the &apos;sidereal year&apos;: the time it takes for the Earth to make<br/>a complete revolution with respect to the stars.
