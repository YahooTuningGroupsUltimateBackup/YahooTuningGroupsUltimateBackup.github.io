Fischer<br/>&gt; We have demonstrated, that if we tune the members of the<br/>&gt;chord of C so as to get absolutely pure harmony, we could not use the<br/>&gt;chord of A on account of the flat fifth E, which did duty so perfectly<br/>&gt;as  third in the chord of C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There is but one solution to this problem: Since we cannot tune either<br/>&gt; the fifth or third perfect, we must compromise, we must strike the<br/>&gt;happy medium.  So we will proceed by a method that will leave our fifths<br/>&gt; flatter than perfect, but not so much as to make them at all displeasing,<br/>&gt; and that will leave our thirds sharper than perfect, but not intolerably<br/>&gt; so.</p><p>This is a common misconception today, that there is no room between the<br/>meantone tunings and ET.  There is more than one solution to the problem of<br/>fifths and thirds, and those are the temperaments promoted between<br/>Werckmiester and Fischer.  We call them well temperaments, but at the time<br/>they were often called Equal.<br/>   Pianists today are beginning to find that softening the exact ET with all<br/>those 13 cent thirds in it gives a new life to the piano, and are finding<br/>that something very beautiful occurs when a piece of classical or Romantic<br/>era music is played on a temperaments that were in vogue at the time of<br/>composition.<br/>   Dave&apos;s recordings are quite valuable, and they are the only ones I know<br/>that allow a temperament comparison with one piece played in several. I will<br/>have our second temperament CD out next fall that will use five different<br/>tunings for six different pieces, (from Scarlatti to Grieg).<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
