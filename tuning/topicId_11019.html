That said, in spite of going over it a bit, some minor things to say:</p><p>1. In one response I put &quot;Bill again&quot;, when it was actually the first reply to a comment from Bill Alves. Who, judging by his work, knows more than enough about sampling/synthesis, etc. Nice chapter in the Csound book, Bill!</p><p>2. On reflection, I really hope my comments about the book &quot;Enclosure 3&quot; didn&apos;t come off harsh with regard to price: the book, while more than worth it, does clock in at something like $75, which is not a figure to sneeze at. Not everyone can afford it, or afford it immediately, or fit into their bigger life agenda. That you&apos;ve got it now, Johnny, is a great thing indeed. But for others, there must be copies out there in libraries. In fact, I know it.</p><p>3. In thinking about whether I view Partch as a pioneer, I remembered a quote that I&apos;ve often felt captured why I find Partch singular:</p><p>&quot;That Harry Partch is no ordinary person is obvious. If his accomplishments in music had been slight, perhaps it could all end here -- but on the contrary, his accomplishments have been considerable. Anyone who has sat in a room, surrounded by Partch&apos;s many instruments, and listened to his music -- this complete and, to many, alien world of sound and drama -- knows what an intimidating experience this can be. The very thought of adopting a philosophical position diametrically opposed to a well-entrenched existing tradition, building a theory of tonal relationships and the instruments to realize this theory, composing the music, staging the drama, rehearsing and bringing it all to performance, recording the result -- all in the face of an uncomprehending public -- and then having the perseverance (perhaps obstinacy would be a better word) to continue all this for the better part of a lifetime, is a staggering thing to contemplate. Perhaps it is not so staggering if you consider Harry Partch&apos;s ideas about music. Partch and his music are very close to being one and the same thing.&quot;<br/>(Arthur Woodbury, in Source magazine)</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>That&apos;s more than enough from me today, don&apos;t you think?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
