So it was inspiring to play it again. I set it up in the living room of the new house and played pianoteq on my laptop using a Just Intonation tuning (below). Actually I had to improvise the piece twice since I screwed up saving from pianoteq standalone and had to fire up Sonar 8.5 to capture the performance. Then I edited the performance to what you hear. About 20% of the notes were messed with - the rest is the original improvisation.</p><p>The title comes from the Collaborative Ambient Project for which I wrote this piece and is sponsored by a Russian associate Luigi Verona. I&apos;ll bet this is the only solo piano piece he&apos;s received so it will be interesting to see if its accepted.</p><p>Online play<br/><a href="http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=394&p=2702#p2701">http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=394&p=2702#p2701</a></p><p>direct download<br/><a href="http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=546">http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=546</a></p><p>! harm12s.scl<br/>!<br/>Harmonics 1 to 12 and subharmonics mixed<br/>11<br/>!<br/>9/8<br/>8/7<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>11/8<br/>16/11<br/>3/2<br/>8/5<br/>7/4<br/>16/9<br/>2/1</p></div>
