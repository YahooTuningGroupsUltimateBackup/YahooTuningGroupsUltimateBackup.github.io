I suppose<br/>&gt;that was what spurred me on to produce this experiment.</p><p>IMO the number of these break points should be very small and only used<br/>to avoid the problem of key drift.  When introduced they should be at<br/>the points that require the least amount of discontinuity and jump back<br/>to a place that is near (in the prime factorisation space) where the<br/>music came from.</p><p>&gt;I agree that characterizing this experimental tuning as JI<br/>&gt;is *not* a good idea, at least not plain unqualified JI, for the<br/>&gt;reasons David pointed out.  It&apos;s probably unfortunate that<br/>&gt;many theorists and composers, including myself, have used<br/>&gt;&apos;just-intonation&apos; to mean these extended types of rational<br/>&gt;systems, since JI by definition already meant the usual 5-limit<br/>&gt;tuning which provides interlocking consonant 4:5:6 triads.<br/>&gt;Perhaps &apos;extended JI&apos; is a reasonable name, altho just<br/>&gt;calling it a &apos;5-limit rational tuning&apos; is probably best.</p><p>Why not call it AJI.  This is the name I came up with meaning<br/>&quot;Automatic Just Intonation&quot; and Paul independantly (I assume) came up<br/>with &quot;Adaptive Just Intonation&quot; for the same concept.  The word AJI also<br/>has the meaning in Japanese of &quot;taste&quot; which I think is appropriate.</p><p>With other people working on AJI programs of various sorts I have<br/>decided to also have a go at it again.  I intend to start with a program<br/>that will simply read a MIDI file and add the necessary note-tuning<br/>commands and produce an updated MIDI file which can then be played.  It<br/>will not be real time but it will probably not use look ahead so it<br/>could be adapted to real time by someone else later.  I am saying that I<br/>will do it now so that I have to make a start soon.</p><p>I last did some work on an AJI program on an Amiga 500 which was before<br/>I got a 286 which was three computers back!
