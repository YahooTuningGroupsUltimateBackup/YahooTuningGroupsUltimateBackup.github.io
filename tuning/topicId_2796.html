There are numerous music librarians, music critics, radio<br/>hosts, and philanthropists that have, in addition to concert producers,<br/>brought microtonal music into the mainstream.</p><p>Now, before some of you argue off the cuff about whether or not microtonal<br/>music is mainstream, a few points.  First, practically every single<br/>commercial I listen to, on a myriad of channels, uses microtonality to get a<br/>viewer&apos;s attention.  This includes all of the largest corporations.</p><p>Secondly, young people are as likely to give microtonal charms a chance than<br/>they are to give classical music a chance.  This is based on decades of<br/>teaching.  Thirdly, I&apos;m writing on the subject and I&apos;m travelling: the thesis<br/>is holding up.  People know what &quot;microtonal&quot; is and they are sympathetic.</p><p>This is LARGELY due to terriffic adminstrators that understood the challenges<br/>that microtonal music had faced, an who were dedicated to making the<br/>necessary changes.  Names like Kyle Gann, John Schaefer, Frank Oteri, Betty<br/>Freeman, and Joseph Pehrson spring to mind.</p><p>John Schneider and Neil Haverstick of begun microfest/stock traditions which<br/>bring comfort and effectively support the efforts of the AFMM.  The internet<br/>has provided fuller access to those needing assistance.  PITCH for the<br/>International Microtonalist was originally designed to do that which is<br/>increasingly provided by the internet.  It should go online (once updated in<br/>a new edition).</p><p>Administration is how I&apos;ve made the majority of my living.  I&apos;ve been a temp<br/>since the industry began.  Learning to be a corporate secretary may be the<br/>ideal way to learn to mainstream an organization, no matter how obscure it<br/>may seem at first.  Fundraising, powerful correspondence, a state-of-the-art<br/>office, even the general support corporate personnel give to those working in<br/>their midst are all of great benefit.  I&apos;ve written a few pieces, a few<br/>articles, and fulfilled a slew of fundraising-related applications while<br/>administrating.  Oh, and I can type.</p><p>Administrating also means advanced networking: one is constantly in touch<br/>with new individuals and organizations.  This is essentially grass roots<br/>organizing, no different than a political organization.  And no one cements<br/>or successes better than the the present generation of admistrators than<br/>promote microtonality.  Time to give them a shout of grateful recognition!</p><p>Johnny Reinhard, Director<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br/><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
