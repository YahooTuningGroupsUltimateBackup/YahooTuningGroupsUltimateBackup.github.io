You<br/>could say in the 7-limit 37 is a surrogate 22 and 42 is a surrogate 27.</p></div><h3><a id=66502 href="#66502">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2006 7:11:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all.<br/>&gt; &gt; How is it possible that I&apos;ve never heard perhaps a word about 37-EDO?

Its nearly perfect approximations of the 11th and 13th harmonics contrast with an 11.6-cent sharp fifth. 37-ET also has good approximations of the 17th and 19th harmonics.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/temp-porcupine.html</a></p><p>You can also reduce the size of the octave slightly, which helps with the accuracy of some intervals (at the expense of others). Here&apos;s one possibility, a 7-limit TOP tuning:</p><p>2/1: 1196.364741 cents (37 steps)<br/>3/1: 1907.716750 cents (59 steps)<br/>5/1: 2780.739669 cents (86 steps)<br/>7/1: 3362.754948 cents (104 steps)</p><p>(TOP is a particular kind of optimization that&apos;s been discussed on the tuning-math list, which weights the errors according to the complexity of the intervals.)</p></div><h3><a id=66505 href="#66505">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2006 7:49:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, my nomination for an all-around, practical octave division for<br/>&gt; tempering various tonalities would be 89-EDO.
