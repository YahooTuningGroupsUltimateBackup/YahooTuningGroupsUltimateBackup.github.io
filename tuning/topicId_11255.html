If you could possibly encode them as mp3s, it<br/>would be even better... then I can put them up with the other<br/>experiments if you send them to me!  Otherwise, I could do the<br/>conversion myself, but .wav files are large to send.</p><p>Darren Burgess is going to do the chords in CSOUND...so we will have<br/>that version, the TX81Z version and YOURS.</p><p>If they&apos;re all in one place it will make it more interesting to<br/>compare...  However, if you&apos;d prefer to post them somewhere else, that&apos;s<br/>OK too..</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>By the way... I am offline for about a week.  Unfortunately, I have no<br/>laptop, or I would &quot;do list&quot; while I&apos;m away.  I will have some &quot;catching<br/>up&quot; to do!</p><p>____________ _____ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
