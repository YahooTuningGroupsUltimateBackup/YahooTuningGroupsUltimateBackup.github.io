Rather than a resolution by stepwise contrary<br/>motion from the diminished 5th to notes of the tonic triad, you have<br/>at best a resolution by oblique motion, which is not as strong.<br/>Resolution by stepwise contrary motion has provided the framework for<br/>harmonic progression since the middle ages, when such resolutions<br/>were from then-dissonant seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths to<br/>then-consonant fourths, fifths or unisons, fourths or octaves, and<br/>fifths, respectively. In the Renaissance, thirds and sixths were used<br/>as (and tuned as) consonances, so many of these resolutions lost<br/>their power; by allowing the diminished 5th as a vertical interval, a<br/>new dissonance-resolving-stepwise-through-contrary-motion-to-a-<br/>consonance pattern became possible, and in turn facilitated the<br/>estabishment of tonality, largely through its clear position-finding<br/>implications.</p></div><h3><a id=48683 href="#48683">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2003 7:44:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jjensen142000&quot; &lt;jjensen14@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jjensen142000&quot; &lt;jjensen14@h...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.

So with<br/>C as fundamental of the scale, B is formed going up a fifth and then<br/>a third, and A equals to a third up and a fifth down (please octave-<br/>rectify). And both notes represent the same function in two different<br/>triads (third of dominant and subdominant chords). But you&apos;re deadly<br/>right, in a consonantic way, A is more familiar to C and shares with<br/>that note many more overtones.</p><p>Max.</p></div><h3><a id=48777 href="#48777">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 10:58:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; according to a recent addition to the Tuning Dictionary<br/>&gt; &gt; with which paul helped me<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/ratio-of.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/ratio-of.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the hopefully-standard current term for &quot;the totality<br/>&gt; &gt; of 5-odd-limit ratios&quot; is &quot;ratios of 5&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid this isn&apos;t true; 4/3 is a 5-odd-limit ratio, but not a<br/>&gt; ratio of 5 using your definition.</p><p>Yes, Gene is correct, and Monz was incorrect in the above.

Formally they are no less generic.  For anyone who<br/>knows that the free variable is a place holder and has a mind that always<br/>works in pure mathematical forms, p-limit will read formally identical to<br/>o-limit.  But for those less experienced in metalinguistic conventions using<br/>different names p and o will obscure the common form.  In this case I really<br/>want this page to be a definition of &lt;n&gt;-limit, and I&apos;d almost like to see<br/>the page renamed to that, though I recognize this creates other problems.<br/>(Here I&apos;m using angle brackets &lt;&gt; in place of italics, as is a convention in<br/>some contexts.)  As I see it, items &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; on the page are alternate<br/>definitions of &lt;n&gt;-limit.  Using a different name for the free variable in<br/>the two alternate definitions does not not fit with making the page a<br/>definition of &lt;n&gt;-limit.</p><p>Also, using p versus o does not in any way correspond to a restriction in<br/>the values taken on the the free variable, for example, as i,j,k are in some<br/>circles used for integers while x,y,z are used for real numbers (etc.).  The<br/>definitions given on the limits page require neither p to be prime nor o to<br/>be odd (although common usage would have them be so).</p><p>I&apos;m only talking about this definition page.  Where do you see advantage for<br/>using &quot;p-limit&quot; and &quot;o-limit&quot;?  Neither the p nor the o appears when the<br/>variable is no longer a place-holder, in actual language when an arabic<br/>integer appears in its place.  &quot;11&quot; looks the same when replacing &quot;p&quot; as<br/>when replacing &quot;o&quot;.  &quot;11-p-limit&quot; on the other hand would be an example of a<br/>useful construct.  Then we could talk about &lt;n&gt;-p-limit versus &lt;n&gt;-o-limit,<br/>and have separate definitions for p-limit and o-limit (with no italics).  Or<br/>just use &lt;n&gt;-plimit and &lt;n&gt;-olimit without the extra hyphen, as I previously<br/>suggested.</p><p>(Keep in mind I have never been witness to any tuning-math discussions.)</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=48924 href="#48924">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2003 1:37:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This reply turned into a late-night ramble, which still might<br/>interest someone.

The question is whether &quot;approximation&quot; is well-enough<br/>&gt; defined.</p><p>Mathematically, any *mapping* can be defined as your &quot;approximation&quot;,<br/>even if it makes no sense acoustically. And what makes sense<br/>acoustically can be quite controversial. On the tuning-math list,<br/>we&apos;ve been talking primarily about temperament. Temperament is based<br/>on taking the infinite lattice of JI, usually of a certain *prime<br/>limit* (but in general defined in terms of *any* basis of consonant<br/>intervals, whether nonconsecutive primes or even ratios that don&apos;t<br/>include a fundamental), and lessening the number of dimensions of<br/>infinitude by eliminating certain &quot;unison vectors&quot; or commas, either<br/>purely algebraically/abstractly, or by adjusting the original<br/>consonances slightly so that the commas &quot;vanish&quot;. Monz is about to<br/>release some wonderful software that will show this in action and<br/>allow you to make music with the resulting tunings.</p><p>The classic example of this is meantone, which is based on the 5-<br/>limit lattice with 81:80 (the syntonic comma) vanishing; thus the<br/>number of dimensions of infinitude of this 5-limit system is reduced<br/>from 2 to 1. That and one other type of temperament, which is based<br/>on the 7-limit lattice with 64:63 and 50:49 vanishing (thus reducing<br/>it from 3 infinite dimensions to 1) -- as well as the notion<br/>of &apos;chromatic unison vectors&apos;, which partition the infinitude into a<br/>finite &apos;unaltered scale&apos; and its occurences in chromatically altered<br/>form (&apos;sharp&apos;, &apos;double sharp&apos;, . . . &apos;flat&apos;, &apos;double flat&apos; . . .) --<br/>are the subject of this paper:</p><p><a href="http://www.lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://www.lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a></p><p>(Note that I was still using the *prime* definition of limit in the<br/>above paragraph!)</p><p>Anyway, there is a wide range of useful (to different people,<br/>perhaps) error levels to consider. Besides meantone, the most famous<br/>5-limit temperament with one dimension of infinitude is schismic<br/>(32768:32805, the 2-cent &apos;schisma&apos;, tempered out among eight 3:2s and<br/>one 5:4). Smaller and smaller commas require you to go further and<br/>further out in the lattice to find them. Clearly, though, the greater<br/>the error you will allow, the more *simple commas* you will consider<br/>tempering out, and simple commas lead to *simple temperaments* where<br/>the infinite dimensions are not only made finite, but *small* and<br/>manageable. If you are using &apos;cloudy&apos; timbres with weak and/or<br/>inharmonic partials, you can get away with more error, and find<br/>temperaments like &apos;pelogic&apos; (135:128 vanishing), where the period is<br/>the octave and the generator is around 523 cents, hence its &apos;native&apos;<br/>scales resemble the 5- and 7-note &apos;pelog&apos; scales. This sort of thing,<br/>with the novel chord progressions it allows, is more interesting than<br/>hearing the same old just-intontion sounds in this or that system<br/>that happens to be slightly more manageable.</p><p>With some thought, you can see that if the comma you&apos;re tempering out<br/>is n:d, then the &apos;complexity&apos; of the temperament it defines -- the<br/>length in the lattice of the &apos;finite dimension&apos; it introduces -- is<br/>roughly proportional to log(n), or just as well, log(d). Now the size<br/>of the comma in cents, since it is small, will be roughly<br/>proportional to |n-d|/d, or just as well, |n-d|/n. Hence if we temper<br/>out the comma, the average error it will introduce into the &apos;rungs&apos;<br/>of the lattice is roughly proportional to the size of the comma in<br/>cents divided by the &apos;complexity&apos;.</p><p>It would be nice to make a list of commas, at least 5-limit ones<br/>(prime-limit of course), where some &apos;badness&apos; function of average<br/>error and complexity is not too great. If we want an infinite list,<br/>finite within each complexity range, we can use what Gene calls &apos;log-<br/>flat badness&apos; and get a list like this:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/database">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/database</a>?<br/>method=reportRows&amp;tbl=10&amp;sortBy=3</p><p>We didn&apos;t actually compile an infinite list; rather, we cut off the<br/>low end by error and the high end by complexity, so after you click<br/>on &apos;Next&apos; enough times, you&apos;ll see the most complex temperament on<br/>the list, based on the &apos;atom of kirnberger&apos; as its &quot;vanishing comma&quot;.</p><p>If we want a finite list, Gene tells us that Baker&apos;s Theorem (I wish<br/>I knew more) assures us that we can use a &apos;badness&apos; function<br/>called &apos;epimericity&apos;, which is</p><p>log(|n-d|)/log(d), or just as well, log(|n-d|)/log(n)</p><p>This can be expressed as</p><p>log(&quot;avg. error&quot;)/&quot;complexity&quot; + log(&quot;complexity&quot;)/&quot;complexity&quot; + 1</p><p>I just spent a couple of hours scratching my head -- this appears at<br/>first to be a *decreasing* function of complexity -- but it isn&apos;t<br/>since log(&quot;avg. error&quot;) will almost always be negative!</p><p>Anyway, if we toss out epimericities above 0.5, and &apos;commas&apos; larger<br/>than 600 cents, here&apos;s the list of 5-limit commas, epimericities, and<br/>names of temperaments (from the database above)</p><p>16:15 0 father<br/>6:5 0 ------<br/>81:80 0 meantone<br/>4:3 0 ------<br/>9:8 0 ------<br/>10:9 0 ------<br/>5:4 0 ------<br/>25:24 0 dicot<br/>27:25 0.210309918 beep<br/>128:125 0.227535398 augmented<br/>32805:32768 0.3472592 schismic<br/>250:243 0.35424875 porcupine<br/>135:128 0.396697481 pelogic<br/>2048:2025 0.41184295 diaschismic<br/>15625:15552 0.444302056 kleismic<br/>256:243 0.466943504 blackwood<br/>648:625 0.487048023 diminished<br/>32:27 0.488324507 ------<br/>3125:3072 0.493376213 magic</p><p>Those with no name have such high error that they can&apos;t reasonably be<br/>considered 5-limit temperaments.

Which is the reason the page must be listed under L.  But<br/>if you must push me to my formal best I would advocate the form of an<br/>implicit context-sensitive definition, e.g.</p><p>    limit</p><p>        &lt;n&gt;-limit</p><p>            1      blah1 &lt;n&gt;-limit blah2</p><p>            2      blah3 &lt;n&gt;-limit blah4</p><p>In other words limit is being defined implicitly based on its involvement in<br/>the form &lt;n&gt;-limit.  It actually can not be defined otherwise.  Or rather,<br/>other definitions of &quot;limit&quot; would be a separate point.  For example one<br/>might discuss other notions of &quot;limit&quot; that do not depend on usage in the<br/>form &lt;n&gt;-limit.</p><p>As a formalist, I would want to look up &lt;n&gt;-limit in the first place, just<br/>as Mathematica would do in pattern matching, for example.  But<br/>english-language dictionaries to not support such formalisms.  So &lt;n&gt;-limit<br/>would have to be found under &quot;limit&quot;.  Indeed, Mathematica does the very<br/>same thing, associating all patterns involving a given symbol with the<br/>symbol itself.  Yet the pattern definitions retain their forms and do not<br/>try to be definitions of the symbol without the form.</p><p>I also advocate that adherence to formalisms should be done only to the<br/>extent that it does not interfere significantly with ordinary interpretation<br/>by ordinary people.  For those purposes I also like to see redundant cues,<br/>and reshaping of formalisms so that the result can serve both the formalists<br/>and everyone else (and a given person can fall in both categories at the<br/>same time) to maximal advantage.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=48933 href="#48933">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2003 7:33:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; but it&apos;s late and i&apos;m too tired to do it now ... if you&apos;d<br/>&gt; like to make an addition to the definitions i&apos;ll be happy<br/>&gt; to add them in tomorrow!  ;-)</p><p>I made a huge post on this but for some reason it hasn&apos;t appeared on<br/>the list yet . . . maybe I sent it to you personally?
