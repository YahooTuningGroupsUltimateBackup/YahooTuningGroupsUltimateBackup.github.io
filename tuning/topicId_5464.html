Most of the<br/>time, it seems, it behooves us to be ignorant that words are symbols.  A<br/>high percentage of speech is actually made of phrases -- many of which even<br/>have literal meanings in contemporary English -- whose meaning has become<br/>atomic.  This is a major contributor to the &quot;e-mail bug&quot;; the atomisizing<br/>often depends on intonation.</p><p>Besides the e-mail bug, there are one or two other things known to get<br/>people to notice the symbolic nature of words =8^)...  One of them is when<br/>words are new to a context.  To the point:</p><p>[Paul Erlich]<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t mean to be obstinate, but it depends on what you mean by &quot;fly&quot;. The<br/>&gt;decatonic scale, like the ordinary diatonic scale, depends on &quot;puns&quot;<br/>&gt;relative to JI.</p><p>Does anybody know who first used the word &quot;pun&quot; in this context?  They<br/>deserve a pat on the back.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
