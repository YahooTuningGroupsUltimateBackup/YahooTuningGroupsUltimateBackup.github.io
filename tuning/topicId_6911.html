Well, I pulled<br/>out my copy and listened, and there&apos;s some great stuff on there! I have<br/>begun making .wav files of the tape, and I will turn the .wavs into mp3<br/>and post them on the Tuning Punks site at <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> if the composers of the<br/>pieces wish. Unfortunately, I have misplaced the program notes, so if you<br/>wish me to post your piece, please let me know its number and side. Also,<br/>if you do not like the way I have recorded it after I have posted it, you<br/>may submit your version in mp3 format and I will be glad to repost it.<br/>Remember, my copy is at least 3rd generation: your copy to Dennis&apos; master<br/>to my copy. The quality is really quite good though, and I am using decent<br/>equipment to run it off, so the mp3s should be OK.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2000 7:13:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Denis Atadan&apos;s tape swap contained some excellent microtonal pieces, but<br/>despite a couple of pleas, I have been unable to get a response from<br/>most of the participants to put these on the Tuning Punks. I made high<br/>quality wav files of the pieces and cleaned them of tape hiss with Cool<br/>Edit. The tape swap could be recorded as a regulation CD, and if  the<br/>participants are willing, it could be offered for sale just as the<br/><a href="mailto:Tuning@earth.mills.edu">Tuning@earth.mills.edu</a> CD was. Of course without money to press it, it<br/>would have to be burned one at a time, and the cost in terms of time and<br/>materials to the person who mails out the copies and does the work is an<br/>issue. *I* don&apos;t want to do it, but if someone else is interested, and<br/>the participants agree, and some sort of swell plan is come up with, I<br/>would be willing to make a master, or even several masters, so that *The<br/>Plan* could be implemented.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;</p></div>
