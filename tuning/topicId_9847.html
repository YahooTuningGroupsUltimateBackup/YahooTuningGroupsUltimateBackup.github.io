He might<br/>&gt;sing,<br/>&gt;instead, 9/8, 12/11, 13/12 (cumm=9/8, 27/22, 117/88 = 204c, 355c,<br/>&gt;493c).<br/>&gt;This would be heard by him and his audience as  9/8, 11/9, 4/3).  So<br/>&gt;this<br/>&gt;too, is equivalent.</p><p>Unless he underwent extensive training with an instrument, I doubt<br/>our<br/>chanter could or would accurately produce 12/11 or 13/12 steps<br/>unaccompanied.</p></div>
