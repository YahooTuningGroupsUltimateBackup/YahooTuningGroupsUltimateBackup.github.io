This has enraged representatives<br/>of the avant-garde, experimentalist composer John Cage, who died in<br/>1992. The silence on his group&apos;s album clearly sounds uncannily like<br/>4&apos;33&quot;, the silence composed by Cage in his prime.</p><p>Batt said last night: &quot;I&apos;ve received a letter on behalf of John Cage&apos;s<br/>music publishers. I was in hysterics when I read their letter.</p><p>&quot;As my mother said when I told her, &apos;which part of the silence are they cla=<br/>iming you nicked?&apos;. They say they are claiming copyright on a piece of mine =<br/>called &apos;One Minute&apos;s Silence&apos; on the Planets&apos; album, which I credit Batt/Cag=<br/>e just for a laugh. But my silence is original silence, not a quotation from=<br/> his silence.&quot;</p><p>John Starrett speaking: If this is true, then perhaps Batt should claim tha=<br/>t his silence is in BlackJack or JI, whereas Cage&apos;s was firmly rooted in 12t=<br/>et.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 9:53:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;jdstarrett&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu">jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;</p><p>I have no idea if this is a joke, but here it is, as it appears in<br/><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449">http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449</a></p><p>I heard about this a few days ago on another list,<br/>sounds real.</p><p>* David Beardsley<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com">http://biink.com</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 11:23:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jdstarrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I have no idea if this is a joke, but here it is, as it appears in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449">http://www.independent.co.uk/story.jsp?story=307449</a></p><p>I believe this article gives a little more background:</p><p><a href="http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=17428">http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=17428</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
