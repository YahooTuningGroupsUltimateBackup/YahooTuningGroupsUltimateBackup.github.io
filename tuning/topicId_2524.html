It would<br/>appear to be something on the order of rendering a given sequence of cents<br/>in the smallest possible ratio representations...[?] What&apos;s the<br/>process/method?<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I wrote the program back in the summer of 95 using Masm 6, and I didn&apos;t stop<br/>to put in comments, so the source is not that easy to read, but I did find<br/>the source code, and I would be happy to mail that and the executable to<br/>anyone who is interested.</p><p>Also, I was able to find my explanation of the program in a message I posted<br/>to the list back then:</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>I have written a program to derive a JI scale that approximates<br/>an ET scale.</p><p>I used the following algorithm.</p><p>The et scale is expressed in ratios of 12 decimal digit integers.<br/>A series of fractional approximations is derived for each<br/>interval in the scale using multiplication inverses.  The first<br/>approximations in this series is the most accurate, and the last<br/>is the least accurate.</p><p>Typically, the least accurate approximation will be the same for<br/>several intervals of the scale.</p><p>The program checks the least accurate approximations for every<br/>note of the scale.  If that approximation is used for only one<br/>note, that approximation is assigned to that note.  If it is not<br/>unique, it is assigned to the note that it best represents.</p><p>The program then repeats the procedure for the next more<br/>accurate level of approximation until all notes have been<br/>assigned approximations.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Thanks for your interest,</p><p>Marion</p></div>
