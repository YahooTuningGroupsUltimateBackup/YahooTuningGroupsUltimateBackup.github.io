The Waldstein Sonata happens<br/>to work particularly well with Young tuning.  But it occurs to me that,<br/>for something like, say, Bach&apos;s Well-Tempered Clavier, if I were to<br/>feed an individual section in a distant key into my program, it would<br/>almost certainly come up with COFT values very different from anything<br/>historical, and, arguably, very different from what Bach intended.<br/>There would be at least two possible ways of dealing with this:</p><p>   . Concatenate the entire set of sections together and get COFT<br/>     numbers to be used for grounding the entire work.</p><p>   . Simply instruct the program to ground to a Well Temperament such<br/>     as Bach might have used, then allow subtle adaptive variations from<br/>     those grounding points.</p><p>The second option is not something I support at the moment, but just<br/>a couple of new lines of programming code could change that.  The<br/>results of the first option would be very interesting to compare against<br/>what was present in Bach&apos;s time!</p><p>[Bob:]<br/>&gt;There may be parallels between what your program does for tuning with<br/>&gt;how David Cope determines &apos;note choice&apos;. You might think about doing a<br/>&gt;write-up in Computer Music Journal.</p><p>Sorry to say that I&apos;m not familiar with David Cope and his work.  Please<br/>tell me more!  If it&apos;s not tuning related, we should probably take it<br/>off-list (in case you don&apos;t receive e-mails from the list, my addr is<br/>jdl&quot;at&quot;<a href="http://adaptune.com">adaptune.com</a>).</p><p>I&apos;ve thought of submitting write-ups of my work to CMJ and/or other<br/>similar journals.  I feel as if I&apos;d need help getting it worked up into<br/>a form suitable for academic periodicals, however.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17568 href="#17568">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
