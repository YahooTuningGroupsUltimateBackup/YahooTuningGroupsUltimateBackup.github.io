The only reason I respond strongly is because<br/>the issue is an important one to confront.</p><p>EVERYTHING about the tone system, compositional/improvisational<br/>structure, and performance style is of Armenian music is<br/>fundamentally different than that of Turkish music.<br/>One need only state that musical treatises in classical Armenian were<br/>written in the 6th through 8th centuries, well before the world even<br/>knew of a people known as the Turks to understand the absurdity of a<br/>statement claiming there is no difference between the two.  Without<br/>delving into the details of cultural ethnogenesis in Anatoila and the<br/>Caucasus, one need only listen to the music of Georgia and Armenia to<br/>understand their fundamental difference from the Turkish or Ottoman<br/>counterpart.</p><p>The only area in which the claim below might make any sense is in<br/>reference to the music of some urban dwelling armenians during the<br/>19th century, which by itself is not considered the armenian musical<br/>tradition, but an odd offshoot of Ottoman music blending some<br/>armenian elements. These armenians had more or less assimilated into<br/>what was a multi-ethnic empire at the time (the Ottoman Empire). So,<br/>you find armenian songs  which employ the oud (a typically non-<br/>armenian instrument), while keeping the intonational basis of Ottoman<br/>music (which was the &quot;norm&quot;, one would presume). Besides this fringe<br/>element, the majority armenian music is not based on the maqam<br/>(armenia and georgia are probably the only exceptions in the region),<br/>nor does it employ the rhythmic or melodic shapes of Ottoman music,<br/>or Turkish music (I can discuss the difference between the two with<br/>anyone who cares enough, but seeing as this post is already fairly<br/>long, I&apos;ll leave it at that.)</p><p>Armenian music, to put it briefly, has a tradition of choral singing<br/>that has been documented since the 6th century, employing mostly<br/>duophany. According to the scholarship I&apos;m familiar with, the<br/>intonational tendencies are, along with the ornamentation guidelines,<br/>still awaiting the unraveling of the neumatic system in which they<br/>were written, the deciphering of which is still the main<br/>preoccupation of musicologists in Yerevan, Armenia to this day.</p><p>The folk music is simpler than that of the neighboring Georgian<br/>tradition. A characteristic element is probably the lowered second<br/>degree, (also used by georgians), which I&apos;ve heard sung in various<br/>intonational hues.<br/>One of my current projects is (after getting FTS to finally respond!)<br/>to make a small catalogue of tunings used in both georgian and<br/>armenian music.</p><p>Except for the neumatic notation of the choral tradition, I doubt<br/>very much that musicians ever bothered to decide the exact tuning.<br/>Remember, the &quot;dark ages&quot; of armenian culture began roughly in the<br/>13th century, and it&apos;s been more or less downhill from there (except<br/>in certain areas), so during the time when Ottoman , Persian and<br/>Western court music elevated the general level of musical studies<br/>(such as clearly defining intonational tendencies, etc.), Armenians<br/>(and Georgians intermittantly) were living under occupation (until<br/>our own century) and thus did not experience a development of musical<br/>studies and scholarship.</p><p>I&apos;ve asked musicians about intonation issues (including the most<br/>respected), and their usual answer is that the ear dictates whether<br/>something is &quot;good&quot;. The question, as one of them put it, is not<br/>whether I&apos;m hitting &quot;the&quot; right pitch, but &quot;a&quot; right one which feels<br/>right right now (redundancy of &quot;right&quot; purely accidental).</p><p>Having said that, I do have a text which was written in the 1800&apos;s in<br/>Istanbul, which does show some ratios in the appendix. I can look<br/>those up and pass them on to the group if there is interest.</p><p>and Justin in Australia, I&apos;d be happy to send you some more<br/>information about the tetrachordal scale structure of Armenian music,<br/>tas well as some recordings which you may be able to find.</p><p>And, by the way, similarly rediculous claims are made today about<br/>Kurdish music. A minority, mind you, which does not have the right to<br/>teach its own language in Turkey. No wonder it&apos;s important to tell<br/>unsuspecting westerners that they are, after all, just an extension<br/>of &quot;us&quot;.</p><p>&gt; remind that eastern music traditions (including the Armenian one)<br/>do not differ in tuning, tone system and<br/>compositional/improvisational structure but in performance style.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One who bothers about the Armenian tuning will have to trace back<br/>to<br/>&gt; the already mentioned classical eastern musicological resources and<br/>&gt; compare them with the &quot;real&quot; recordings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speaking for the Armenian population in Turkey and their music,<br/>there<br/>&gt; is nothing diferent about the tone system/tuning and makam<br/>structure<br/>&gt; than the Turkish one, actually, both of which being integral parts<br/>of<br/>&gt; the same tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One &quot;modern&quot; yet cited source on Armenian music is &quot;Armenian Folk<br/>&gt; Songs, Sirvart Poladian, University of California Press, 1942,<br/>&gt; Berkeley and Los Angeles, USA&quot; which some of you may already be<br/>&gt; familiar with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Ertugrul<br/>&gt; ...who just dropped by and now leaving...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;justintonation&quot; &lt;JUSTINTONATION@H...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hello tuners.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was listeneing to a very beautiful piece of music the other<br/>day.<br/>&gt; It &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was wondering whether anybody knew about the scales and<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning/s used in Armenian music.

I was merely responding<br/>to the baselessness of the statement that intonational, melodic and<br/>other aspects of armenian music &quot;were in no way different&quot; than<br/>others in the area, and that these accusations are made all too often.<br/>As I said in my original post, the only reason I felt the need to<br/>respond strongly is because this is not the first time that these<br/>claims have been made, and I am, unfortunately, certain that they<br/>will continue to be made unless they are corrected.</p><p>I myself have a kurdish and two turkish friends with whom I discuss<br/>all this issues now and then. Any racism which you accuse me of is,<br/>once again, baseless.</p><p>As to the competition of who was where earlier, my statement was to<br/>the fact what while the migrations from the east which eventually<br/>culminated in the large scale settlement of altaic speakers in<br/>anatolia (AND THE IMPORT, WITH THEM, OF INTONATIONAL SYSTEMS)had<br/>still not been completed, armenians and georgians already had their<br/>own systems of music. Thus, to imply that the only difference is one<br/>of performace style is difficult to understand given those historical<br/>facts. I was referring to established units in anatolia, not &quot;whose<br/>people are older&quot;. I agree that the latter is a meaningless waste of<br/>time.</p><p>Indeed, there is no competetion, and indeed music should be bridging<br/>the difficulties some civilizations have among one another. However,<br/>cultural identity cannot be swept aside by mere generalizations, such<br/>as &quot;they are the same except for performance practice&quot;, which is<br/>the exact issue I was refuting.</p><p>People like ourselves should be finding ways of bridging gaps through<br/>music. Perhaps sometimes and intitial conversation is thorny, since<br/>the inherited situation is thorny to begin with. My hope is to make<br/>bridge gaps, not expand them. I do believe, however, that certain<br/>misstatements require a strong response.</p><p>I take charges of racism seriously, and would invite you to dinner<br/>with other turkish friends if you lived in boston.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; also happy with my best neighbours, a Kurdish family, and playing<br/>&gt; with their lovely little 2yo kid, &quot;accompanying&quot; her pure and<br/>&gt; innocent singing, completely unaware of racisme and nationalisme<br/>&gt; garbage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was happy for having a good Armenian schoolmate for 7 years,<br/>whose<br/>&gt; rememberance is still fresh in my mind and heart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m happier than ever for having been under the sufi training of a<br/>&gt; Kurdish sheikh for the last eight precious years of my life.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We, good people here, do not mark each other with ethnic<br/>identities.<br/>&gt; Nobody is &quot;extension&quot; of nobody.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now back to making music with my group of several Turks, a Kurd, a<br/>&gt; couple of Bosnian-descendants; occassionally an Arab and a Gypsie.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards, regarding your humanity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ertugrul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS: Sorry for having to write out this off topic article, which<br/>shall<br/>&gt; not be continued.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t be expresing my ideas on this group anymore.
