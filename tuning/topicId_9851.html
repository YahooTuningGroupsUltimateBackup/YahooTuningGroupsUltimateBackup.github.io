One is diatonic<br/>(two octaves, 15 steels strings of three different thickness, lowest note is<br/>central C)  and one is chromatic (two octaves also, 25 strings, lowest note<br/>G like the violins 4th string). The design is extremely simple, just strings<br/>mounted over two curved bridges on a more or less round box, the form of<br/>which is determinate by three exponentional curves. Strings are about 1 cm<br/>apart an can be tuned with tuning pegs fixed in the wood, just like the<br/>harpsichord.<br/>The simplicity, especially of the diatonic zither, makes the instrument<br/>extremely favourable for music teaching: initiating young children to melody<br/>and harmony. Of course, as a teacher, I will sneak in some microtonality!<br/>This zither, called Cithare Aurore in French,  has been invented, if you may<br/>say so, by Martial MURRAY in 1995. He received an award for it by the French<br/>Ministry of Education. Even if most of time the zither will be used by<br/>children or old people, both of them learning music for the first time in<br/>their life, the construction is absolutely professional and the sound is as<br/>pure as you can imagine, even if you play very loud. (It&apos;s much louder than<br/>an harpsichord, but not as loud as a concert harp.) Martial assured me that<br/>the highest string can be tuned up at least two  whole tones above its<br/>normal pitch, so all kinds of microtonal tunings are possible. I hope to use<br/>the chromatic zither very soon in one of Maurice Ohana&apos;s ensemble pieces. He<br/>prescribes a 18tET zither in several of his compositions.</p><p>The price is unbelievable: 750 FF (about 110$) for the diatonic and 980 FF<br/>for the chromatic one. They weigh slightly over 2 kilos and can be send<br/>straight from Martial&apos;s workshop all over the world. He&apos;s got a web-site in<br/>French with some pictures of the instrument:</p><p><a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/cithares.martial.murray/AURORE.HTM">http://perso.wanadoo.fr/cithares.martial.murray/AURORE.HTM</a></p><p>I go on tuning, Wim</p></div>
