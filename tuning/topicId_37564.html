I merely<br/>state and defend what it is i do. Each artist has their own directions and points of light they<br/>are attracted to and the materials that work for one will not work for others. Personally i would<br/>feel a bit crowded if every one did JI (not that this is necessarily what it i is i do). I am<br/>sorry that they failed to recognize that there are others who works along Parallel lines- i<br/>imagine dan Sterns might fit this.<br/>    You rightly point out that there are quite a few other approaches to tuning that are never<br/>mentioned. Any of the MOS formed by single generators, any of the fibonacci or noble number scales<br/>, just to add two to yours. Also to bring up world music in that when we look at these scales we<br/>see little JI and just as little ET. What we need if anything is even more approaches than what we<br/>have!</p><p>NP Mixtur-Stockhausen</p><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; I compose in just intonation and out.
