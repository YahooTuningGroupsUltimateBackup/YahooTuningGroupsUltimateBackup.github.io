And this is just (no pun intended) one person who has<br/>successfully utilized JI - many, many more, I assure you, including<br/>people that have as recently as this week posted new recordings of JI<br/>music, not to mention people on this list that compose and perform in<br/>JI (in addition to other tunings as well).</p><p>It&apos;s a big world, and it is easy to miss some stuff. But it is pretty<br/>hard to miss someone like Partch, and many people don&apos;t. They might<br/>be scratching their heads about now when they see the bit<br/>about &quot;never used in practice&quot;...</p><p>Looking forward to spending a little more time on your site tonight!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=35338 href="#35338">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>3/8/2002 4:46:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:F60MAKyttoRaD689cMh00007ce5@hotmail.com">F60MAKyttoRaD689cMh00007ce5@hotmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>Family Tyler wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;I have just put the finishing touches on a new website which<br/>&gt; hopefully puts an&nbsp; new slant on the subject of Tunings and<br/>&gt; Temperaments.&nbsp; I would really appreciate any comments,<br/>&gt; notification of problems, encouragement etc.&nbsp; The site can be<br/>&gt; found at:&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A<br/>&gt; href=&quot;<a href="http://www.ppexpressivo.wyenet.co.uk">http://www.ppexpressivo.wyenet.co.uk</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="http://www.ppexpressivo.wyen">http://www.ppexpressivo.wyen</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://et.co.uk">et.co.uk</a>&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</p><p>This is good in intent, but it&apos;s the problems I&apos;m going to concentrate on<br/>because they&apos;re always easier to discuss.  Don&apos;t let that put you off!</p><p>You say &quot;but musical instruments and almost all modern music is based on<br/>sets of discrete notes&quot;.  This is a gross over-simplification.  You say<br/>you&apos;re a cellist -- well, do you *really* think a cello uses a discrete<br/>set of notes?</p><p>The &quot;almost universally&quot; popup could be replaced with a link (replacing<br/>the top-level frame) to<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octequiv.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/octequiv.html</a>&gt;.  I completely<br/>disagree with the last sentence of what you have: &quot;However, these are very<br/>much the exceptions.&quot;  These kinds of imperfect octaves are the rule, not<br/>the exception.</p><p>Having some kind of octave is the rule for music that covers more than an<br/>octave.  So the octave phenomenon is the nearest we have to a universal,<br/>but its tuning of 2:1 is certainly not.  The link I gave before explains<br/>this.</p><p>Your definition of &quot;tuning&quot; is a bit odd.  You seem to be saying that<br/>tunings involve integer ratios but temperaments do not.  Rather,<br/>temperaments are a subset of tunings and plenty of tunings are neither<br/>temperaments nor involve integer ratios.</p><p>Could you add a volume control to The Musical Calculator?  I usually have<br/>my system volume set high so I can play MP3s without distortion.  This<br/>stuff came through very loud.  Oh, you&apos;re using Pierre Lewis&apos;s Java.  I<br/>was thinking it how similar it was :-).  I wonder though why I got a<br/>message box about untrusted Active X.</p><p>The phrase &quot;1/4 comma Meantone, sometimes called Aaron&apos;s Meantone or just<br/>plain Meantone&quot; is a good example of why I try to avoid the word &quot;just&quot; in<br/>tuning discussions where it doesn&apos;t refer to just intonation.  1/4 comma<br/>meantone can indeed be referred to as simply &quot;meantone&quot; but &quot;just plain<br/>meantone&quot; suggests a different kettle of ball games.</p><p>You say &quot;A further drawback is that the human ear is more sensitive to<br/>poorly tuned 5ths than it is to 3rds ...&quot; without evidence.  Find some<br/>evidence, or remove the assertion.</p><p>1/11 comma meantone isn&apos;t *quite* the same as 12 note equal temperament.</p><p>Wow, you know about Ordinaire!</p><p>In fact, my general impression of this site is that it&apos;s a worthy attempt<br/>to re-invent the wheel.  There are quite a few sites out there explaining<br/>the traditional temperaments, including Pierre&apos;s that you link to and took<br/>the Java from.  I&apos;d be more interested in hearing your personal opinions<br/>on these topics, and the music you&apos;ve made along the way.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=35354 href="#35354">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2002 2:06:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:</p><p>&gt; You say &quot;A further drawback is that the human ear is more sensitive<br/>to<br/>&gt; poorly tuned 5ths than it is to 3rds ...&quot; without evidence.

Good points. I think we can generalize<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; a fair<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; degree of safety (cringing defensively) that the octave is<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; critical interval in terms of human tolerance for tuning<br/>error,<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect fifth next, etc., right on up the harmonic series, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eliminating factors of two.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Bob, It&apos;s lucky you cringed defensively. :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel that what you say holds until the complexity a*b of a<br/>&gt; ratio<br/>&gt; &gt; a:b<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (in lowest terms) gets up around 35. Then I think tolerance<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mistuning (e.g. in cents) starts to decrease again, but for<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; entirely different reason. A complex ratio doesn&apos;t become<br/>much<br/>&gt; &gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dissonant with mistuning like a simple ratio does, since it<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; already<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fairly dissonant, but it loses its justness, or its identity _as_<br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratio, with a smaller mistuning the more complex the ratio,<br/>until<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; finally up around a complexity of 100 to 120 (depending on<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; timbre<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and lots of other things) it _has_ no identity distinct from its<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; nearby mistunings and its justness cannot be found.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The above assumes we&apos;re talking about bare dyads. If the<br/>&gt; &gt; more complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratios are embedded in larger otonal chords then I think the<br/>&gt; &gt; tolerance<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; stays about the same as we keep going up.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my humble opinion.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i think dave keenan is exactly right. there&apos;s no substitute for<br/>&gt; &gt; actually *listening* to lots of just and mistuned ratios, and<br/>dave<br/>&gt; &gt; has obviously done a great deal of this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***This is terribly interesting, but I&apos;m only *half* getting it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Wendell is saying that the tolerance for error increases as<br/>we go<br/>&gt; further up the harmonic series.

But I have to be honest. I<br/>really haven&apos;t done a lot of listening to the tuning of harmonies.<br/>I&apos;ve done some of course. Occasionally setting up a chord on the synth<br/>with unadorned sawtooth waves and moving one of the notes around with<br/>the pitch wheel. But what I have done a lot of, is listening to all<br/>the people on this list. And whenever someone claims they hear<br/>something that doesn&apos;t fit my current theories, I first give &apos;em a<br/>hard time to make sure they aren&apos;t fooling themselves or have the<br/>numbers wrongs, but ultimately I try to figure out how _everyone_<br/>could be right, even tho at first they may seem to be contradicting<br/>one another, and even if my ears don&apos;t hear it.</p></div>
