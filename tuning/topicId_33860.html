I just read Kyle Gann&apos;s review, and I<br/>pretty much agree with what he had to say; there really is not much to the<br/>book besides historical digressions and many weak arguments in favor of<br/>12-ET, most of which are downright absurd.  There is one passage where 12-ET<br/>is compared to an &quot;advance&quot; in sculpture, where proportions of a figure in<br/>marble are consciously altered because our perceptions of proportion depend<br/>on the negative space and the relative depth of the contours of the figure.<br/>The passage referred to a hand sculpted in the wrong proportion, which looks<br/>right because white things look bigger than they are.  He implies that, &apos;in<br/>the same way&apos; pitches need to be made incorrect so that we perceive them as<br/>being correct.  Obviously this is a big honking musical non sequitur.  The<br/>book abounds with that kind of nonsense.  Forced, illogical analogies appear<br/>page by page with stultifying regularity.  Isacoff wasn&apos;t trying to write a<br/>technical book, so Gann&apos;s criticism that there are no charts and graphs<br/>doesn&apos;t really have a point.  For the general public, I think it&apos;s nice to<br/>see a &apos;popular&apos; book written about a topic that I happen to specialize in.<br/>The fact that it contains a load of BS doesn&apos;t really bother me, because<br/>Isacoff does this along with the offering of a decent introduction to some<br/>history associated with the topic, even though most of it is not musical<br/>history.  As Gann noted, Isacoff follows a formula of mentioning some tawdry<br/>detail every other page, which is predictable and annoying.  But in fact the<br/>month of its release I sold this book to several people who just thought it<br/>sounded interesting, and really for those people who aren&apos;t really interested<br/>in more than an entertaining read, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s such an offensive book.<br/> Even though it contains nothing of consequence for me or anyone else who<br/>knows better, and the BS is offensive if you take it seriously, I have to<br/>admit that &apos;Temperament&apos; contains more about tuning than college music theory<br/>texts do.  Most people with degrees in music probably don&apos;t know half of<br/>what&apos;s in the book, and let&apos;s face it, most people have never even heard of<br/>this stuff.  Obviously, better books need to be written.</p><p>Aaron</p></div>
