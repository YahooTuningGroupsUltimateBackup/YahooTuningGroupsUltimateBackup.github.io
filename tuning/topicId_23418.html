To make a more appropriate<br/>assessment, I need to look in places other than the tuning-list messages<br/>themselves.</p><p>Sooooo, I&apos;d much appreciate hearing your suggestions for URLs for actual<br/>music (MP3, or whatever) that you believe to be DIRECTLY a result of the<br/>tuning list.  Again, my concern is not that the tuning list is worthless<br/>or anything like that, but just that it&apos;s not inspiring much actual<br/>music, so what would prove that opinion wrong is web pages that involve<br/>actual music, not just otherwise &quot;cool&quot; stuff.</p><p>Something of the nature of this recent message from Dan Stearns is the<br/>sort of thing I&apos;m looking for:</p><p>  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>     Hi Robert and Pat,</p><p>     Here&apos;s the links again...</p><p>     Linus Liu playing Bach in what he refers to as a &quot;musically<br/>     sensible<br/>     intonation&quot;, or &quot;how music is naturally sung&quot;:</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/885/885499.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/885/885499.html</a>&gt;</p><p>     Belgian French horn virtuoso Francis Orval performing Joseph<br/>     Pehrson&apos;s<br/>     &quot;Harmonic Etude&quot; in what could be described as how music is<br/>     naturally<br/>     sung by the horn:</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/585/585664.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/585/585664.html</a>&gt;</p><p>     Bradley Lehman&apos;s Dadaesque clavichord deconstruction of Bach&apos;s<br/>     second<br/>     fugue from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 performed in a<br/>     well-temperament similar to Werckmeister III:</p><p>     &lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/920/920962.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/920/920962.html</a>&gt;<br/>     ...</p><p>  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Thanks.</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/21/2001 4:48:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:3B08F56A.4264647A@texas.net">3B08F56A.4264647A@texas.net</a>&gt;<br/>Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sooooo, I&apos;d much appreciate hearing your suggestions for<br/>URLs for actual<br/>&gt; music (MP3, or whatever) that you believe to be DIRECTLY a<br/>result of the<br/>&gt; tuning list.
