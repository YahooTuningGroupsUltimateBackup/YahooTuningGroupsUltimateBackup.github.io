Likewise, might this tension come into play with<br/>&gt;the lower fourth of a 3:4:5 sonority vis-a-vis a 4:5:6 sonority?</p><p>Well, compared with the definition of &quot;smoothness&quot; as the opposite of Plomp<br/>&quot;roughness&quot;, your usage clearly attaches added importance to the lowest<br/>sounding note. Which is what I was getting at with the idea of &quot;rootedness&quot;.</p><p>&gt;You&apos;re evidently coming<br/>&gt;from a perspective in part of 18th-century inversion theory</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;m too influenced by that. However, since Partch was largely<br/>concerned with intervals between pitch classes regardless of octave<br/>transpositions, and he coined the terms otonal and utonal, it seems better<br/>to use other terms to describe the distinction between the two trines, which<br/>as you note, can be regarded either as analogous to major and minor, or<br/>instead, as analogous to the different inversions of the major chord.</p></div>
