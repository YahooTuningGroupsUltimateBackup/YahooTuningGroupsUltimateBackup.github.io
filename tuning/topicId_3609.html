I think that you have hit the nail on<br/>the head with the phrase &quot;such variations are triggered by the spiritual<br/>state of the musician at that moment&quot;.  I compare this to ...</p><p>azrael [TD223.7] in &quot;Effects of sound on consciousness&quot; thread<br/>&gt;...

See <a href="http://www.dhamma.com">http://www.dhamma.com</a> for info.</p><p>Another aspect of these subtle energies I think relates to the physical<br/>locations of musicians relative to each other - a member of a drumming<br/>group told me that from time to time they all move around to get<br/>particular locations relative to each other.  It seems that this could<br/>relate to the wavelengths of the sounds that they make and the phase<br/>relationships between them.  If playing in a particular key it helps if<br/>the distances are a multiple of the fundamental wavelength (which is<br/>usually the subtonic).</p><p>It is quite stressful typing without some letter so I try here to not<br/>need it to see if it is less difficult but it is still tough.
