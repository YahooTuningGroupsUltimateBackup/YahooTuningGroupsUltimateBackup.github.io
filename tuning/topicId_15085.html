In this case the method, turntables and<br/>preexisting material, was simply an &quot;unusual&quot; means to a very specific<br/>end: Dynamic manual adaptive retuning on the fly in strict<br/>&quot;quodlibet&quot;!</p><p>In this case the specific inhabitants of the composite are there to<br/>open the floodgates on another complex dimension of information that<br/>relates to how different expectations influence end results...</p><p>In what sense? Well I remember once reading that the Russian film<br/>director Vsevolod Pudovkin conducted some experiments were he would<br/>film say an expressionless close-up of an actor and then splice that<br/>same shot so that it would follow footage of say a plate of soup, a<br/>young girl lying dead in her coffin, a child at play... He then showed<br/>the finished results to an audience who had to tell what they had<br/>seen. They all noticed how the actor gazed hungrily at the soup, sadly<br/>at the death scene, happily at the child... yet they had all seen the<br/>same impassive face each time...</p><p>In the case of these studies for turntable quartet, the malleability<br/>of what one can perceive as a logical, internally consistent narrative<br/>is eased into motion -- if not entirely facilitated -- by the<br/>relative, but not explicit, familiarity of the source material.</p><p>So &quot;total importation&quot; here was simply the best way I could think of<br/>to calibrate a very specific set of musical questions.</p><p>--d.stearns</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/55/117_west_great_western.html">http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/55/117_west_great_western.html</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/40/after_later.html">http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/40/after_later.html</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/40/microtonal_guitar_2000.html">http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/40/microtonal_guitar_2000.html</a>&gt;</p></div>
