Chapters spotlight historical<br/>contributions by Kirnberger,  Werckmeister, Buxtehude, and Walther, and<br/>intertwine theoretical analysis with  Thuringian Aesthetics, Bach Cities, and<br/>critical details of the art  and science of tuning.  Reinhard&apos;s basic thesis is<br/>that the world got it  wrong: ironically, the most obvious candidate for the<br/>performance of Johann  Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s music has been completely overlooked &ndash;<br/> Werckmeister III  tuning.  Andreas Werckmeister began his historic<br/>explorations into well  temperament with equal temperament experimentation, but<br/>when, in 1706, he  emphasized the need for 48 keys (a repeat of the 12 major<br/>and 12 minor keys) to  fully represent his tuning system&rsquo;s variety of key<br/>characters (Werckmeister,  Musicalishe Paradoxal-Discourse (1707), p. 72), he<br/>set the stage for Bach  to create two books of The Well Tempered Clavier.<br/>Werckmeister&rsquo;s  innovation &ndash; Werckmeister III Tuning &ndash; was intended as a<br/>superior innovation to  equal temperament, and has 39 distinctive musical<br/>intervals, each with a  uniquely different sentiment.  The book opens up a whole<br/>new dimension to  Bach&rsquo;s musical expression, and to the understanding of<br/>music.    http:www.afmm.org</p></div>
