Listen to recordings.  Besides Bach, there are videos of<br/>Mozart  and Haydn that I play on bassoon in Werckmeister on  YouTube.<br/>But really, I am more concerned by your  insistences.  WIII sounds like 12<br/>different major keys and 12 different minor keys.  Why does this translate to<br/>you as being  cent specific?  Without knowing the  key, why couldn&rsquo;t a WIII<br/>selection be many things.<br/>As for Young tuning, I have never played in  it.  But this confusion seems<br/>natural to me.  Too bad, although we  liked the Young, that is one of the more<br/>unlikely tunings used by Bach.  If I wanted to really analyze, perhaps,<br/>hearing a sixth comma fifth as opposed to a quarter comma fifth.  But I just<br/>listened  naturally.<br/>Regarding Bach NOT being in meantone, I have  included the following:<br/>J.  Murray Barbour (1897-1970), in his article &ldquo;Bach and the Art of<br/>Temperament,&rdquo;  clearly and emphatically demonstrated that the great majority of Bach&rsquo;s<br/>works  require a keyboard tuning capable of playing in a full circle of keys,<br/>a  &ldquo;circular temperament.&rdquo;<br/>So persistent is  the legend that Bach still clung to meantone tuning for<br/>organ that it will be  well to cite examples of his freer practice.  But,<br/>although the great majority of  Bach&rsquo;s organ works contain notes excluded from the<br/>meantone compass, the  diehards are not convinced easily (Barbour, The Musical<br/>Quarterly 33, 1946, p.  81).<br/>Barbour  gave numerous examples of works that exceeded the meantone compass.<br/>Barbour wrote:<br/>Conceivably in the  third inversion of a dominant-seventh on D flat in an F<br/>major Toccata, there  would be room for considerable imperfections in the<br/>tuning.  But when Bach calmly modulated to ? sharp minor and made a cadence  there,<br/>or wrote a prelude and fugue in F minor, we can be sure he knew that his<br/>organ was tuned so that these rare keys would be &lsquo;possible&rsquo; ones (Barbour, MQ<br/>33, 1946, p. 81).<br/>After  offering example upon example, Barbour concluded:<br/>But why continue?  The  evidence is over-whelming that Bach could not have<br/>used the meantone tuning for  the organ (Barbour, MQ 33, p. 87).<br/>best, Johnny</p><p>While  I too enjoyed seeing you agree with my selection, this still doesn&apos;t<br/>let you off  the hook.

Listen to recordings.  Besides Bach, there are videos of Mozart and Haydn that I play on bassoon in Werckmeister on YouTube.</p><p>  But really, I am more concerned by your insistences.  WIII sounds like 12 different major keys and 12 different minor keys.  Why does this translate to you as being cent specific?  Without knowing the key, why couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a WIII selection be many things.</p><p>  As for Young tuning, I have never played in it.  But this confusion seems natural to me.  Too bad, although we liked the Young, that is one of the more unlikely tunings used by Bach.  If I wanted to really analyze, perhaps, hearing a sixth comma fifth as opposed to a quarter comma fifth.  But I just listened naturally.</p><p>  Regarding Bach NOT being in meantone, I have included the following:</p><p>  J. Murray Barbour (1897-1970), in his article &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Bach and the Art of Temperament,&acirc;&euro;&#xFFFD; clearly and emphatically demonstrated that the great majority of Bach&acirc;&euro;&trade;s works require a keyboard tuning capable of playing in a full circle of keys, a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;circular temperament.&acirc;&euro;&#xFFFD;</p><p>  So persistent is the legend that Bach still clung to meantone tuning for organ that it will be well to cite examples of his freer practice.  But, although the great majority of Bach&acirc;&euro;&trade;s organ works contain notes excluded from the meantone compass, the diehards are not convinced easily (Barbour, The Musical Quarterly 33, 1946, p. 81).</p><p>  Barbour gave numerous examples of works that exceeded the meantone compass.  Barbour wrote:</p><p>  Conceivably in the third inversion of a dominant-seventh on D flat in an F major Toccata, there would be room for considerable imperfections in the tuning.  But when Bach calmly modulated to ? sharp minor and made a cadence there, or wrote a prelude and fugue in F minor, we can be sure he knew that his organ was tuned so that these rare keys would be &acirc;&euro;&tilde;possible&acirc;&euro;&trade; ones (Barbour, MQ 33, 1946, p. 81).</p><p>  After offering example upon example, Barbour concluded:</p><p>              But why continue?  The evidence is over-whelming that Bach could not have used the meantone tuning for the organ (Barbour, MQ 33, p. 87).</p><p>  best, Johnny</p></div><h3><a id=69121 href="#69121">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2007 4:04:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That is surely overkill at this stage.

Of course it&apos;s something to do with the<br/>partial spectrum, but I can&apos;t tell exactly what.</p><p>On the issue of performance style and articulation, how quick the<br/>damping is has a strong influence. Pianos (and most electronic<br/>instruments) have virtually instantaneous damping, whereas many<br/>harpsichords (or clavichords) take a certain fraction of a second, or<br/>longer, for the tail of the sound to disappear after the finger has<br/>been withdrawn.</p><p>I should take this opportunity to be more precise about what Lindley<br/>meant, and played, with the Ab Prelude: on the piano, he aims to hold<br/>the chords for no more or less than a quarter note. The idea is that<br/>they are effectively staccato half-notes, and give an impression of<br/>staccato because they only occupy 1 beat of 3 in the measure.<br/>Certainly not whipping the hands away as quickly as possible, and I<br/>regret it if people got that impression.</p><p>One point I think John Barnes made back in 1979 is that the G major<br/>Prelude, when played fast on a harpsichord, effectively creates chords<br/>due to the &apos;tail&apos; on the sound overlapping from one note to another -<br/>even if the player doesn&apos;t attempt to use legato. This was one of the<br/>caveats he admitted for his method of counting (chordal) thirds, and<br/>is a possible pitfall of electronic simulations that cut off the sound<br/>immediately at the official end of a note - let alone those that fade<br/>into silence *before* the end!</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

Secor]:<br/>&gt; &gt; As to whether proportional- beating triads are worth the trouble<br/>(or the lack thereof should be a flaw) is, of course, a matter of<br/>conjecture<br/>&gt;<br/>[Tom Dent]:<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t take it myself (i.e. the trouble) - I think there were<br/>some aural tests that showed synchronized beating was actually<br/>obtrusive in most listeners&apos; estimation.</p><p>[Yahya]:<br/>Can you point us to a reference for this?  And didn&apos;t we have a few<br/>proportional-beating temperaments onlist just a while ago (George,<br/>Gene)?  If so, it would be worth including some in our current round<br/>of listening tests, so that list members can evaluate the effect of<br/>synchronised beating for themselves.</p><p>Of course, any tuning whose proportional beats can only be heard in<br/>notes held for a quarter-second or more will need to be represented<br/>by music slow enough for that effect to be noticed.  I think beats<br/>need two full cycles or more to be heard clearly.  For example, a<br/>tuning with an interval that beats two times a second would want<br/>notes of at least a second long, eg a minim (half note) in common<br/>time at 120bpm.  This suggests that our test pieces need to be slow,<br/>with chords (preferably dyads) held for at least a second, and with<br/>all representative dyads of the tuning so represented.</p><p>[George D. Secor]:<br/>&gt; &gt; Yet another flaw would be fifths that zig-zag considerably in<br/>size as one goes around the circle.</p><p>[Tom Dent]:<br/>&gt; This connects up with my &apos;Werckmeister&apos; critique, since if this<br/>happens, you&apos;ll get a combination of an impure third and a fifth<br/>which is unnecessarily out-of-tune given the size of the third.</p><p>[George D. Secor]:<br/>&gt; &gt; In brief, a flaw is anything that causes one or more triads<br/>to &quot;stick out&quot; or to have a sound that could be judged inappropriate,<br/>relative to those adjacent in the circle of fifths.</p><p>[Yahya]:<br/>Seems a reasonable criterion.</p><p>[Tom Dent]:<br/>&gt; And it&apos;s good to have a definite idea of what you think could be<br/>inappropriate!</p><p>[Yahya]:<br/>Indeed!  It&apos;s always so much better when we can sharpen our vague<br/>notions into definite and testable sensa.</p><p>[Tom Dent]:<br/>&gt; OK, I thought of this one quite recently, a mash-up of Youngy and<br/>Neidhardty features:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C -2 G -2 D -2 A -2 E -1 B -1 F# -1 C# 0 G# 0 D# 0 Bb 0 F -1 C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; usual 1/12 PC units.<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~</p><p>[Yahya]:<br/>OK, Tom, would you like to make us a sample piece in this Denty<br/>tuning? ;-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3><a id=69529 href="#69529">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

This may be influenced by whether or not the error of the<br/>&gt; &gt; minor 3rd (or major 6th) has been taken into account, per my<br/>&gt; &gt; observation that beating major 6ths are just as prominent as<br/>beating<br/>&gt; &gt; major 3rds.  I would judge Young #2 to be superior to Valotti in<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; respect, but I recognize that this is open to debate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK ... though I would say that Young 2 favours A major as compared<br/>to<br/>&gt; Eb major.</p><p>Yes, very definitely.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps Young recognized that many &apos;ordinaire&apos;-like tunings<br/>&gt; did favour the sharps. (Which you might want for playing the<br/>dominants<br/>&gt; of relative minor keys.)</p><p>I don&apos;t consider a dissonant dominant in a minor key to be a defect,<br/>but rather an opportunity to take advantage of its effective<br/>resolution to a more consonant tonic chord (a kind of expressive<br/>intonation).  So that isn&apos;t my reason for favoring the sharp keys.</p><p>Rather, it&apos;s that I would not want any of the 8 good major triads in<br/>the Eb-to-G# 1/4-comma meantone gamut to be significantly more<br/>dissonant than 12-ET (and most of them significantly better), which<br/>means that I would expect the 4 worst ones to be B, F#, C#, and G#<br/>major.  (And, yes, this would be especially applicable to<br/>an &apos;ordinaire&apos;.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Another flaw would be excessive tempering of one or more fifths,<br/>&gt; &gt; which IMO would be more than 1/4-comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This makes sense - particularly if the major third on the same root<br/>is<br/>&gt; not pure. One of my objections to the &apos;Werckmeister&apos; formulae is<br/>that<br/>&gt; they have (major) triads where the fifth is 1/4 comma flat and the<br/>&gt; third is 1/2 or even 3/4 comma sharp. It sounds, how shall I put it,<br/>&gt; conflict-ridden. Although the minor third is relatively bad, that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t quite account for the level of aural distress.</p><p>Yes, indeed!  I hadn&apos;t intended to bad-mouth WkIII before the<br/>listening test, in which the G major triad (which should be one of<br/>the best) is clearly worse than F.  G is also worse than Bb, which<br/>(although less obvious than the contrast with F) is readily confirmed<br/>by looking at the numbers.  So this is also a case of bad harmonic<br/>balance, or two flaws for the price of one.</p><p>&gt; I can only accept such flat fifths if the third is virtually pure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As to whether proportional-<br/>&gt; &gt; beating triads are worth the trouble (or the lack thereof should<br/>be a<br/>&gt; &gt; flaw) is, of course, a matter of conjecture<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t take it myself (i.e. the trouble) - I think there were<br/>some<br/>&gt; aural tests that showed synchronized beating was actually obtrusive<br/>in<br/>&gt; most listeners&apos; estimation.</p><p>I remember that, and I made a point to stay out the discussion,<br/>because I didn&apos;t think that the testing was extensive enough to<br/>validate that conclusion.  The purpose of proportional beating is<br/>twofold:</p><p>1) To avoid an undesirable interaction that&apos;s sometimes encountered<br/>between 5ths &amp; 3rds that have slow beat rates that are not<br/>proportional (this is particularly noticeable when the 5th is<br/>tempered by more than 3 cents);</p><p>2) To mask the beating of a major 3rd by giving it the same beat rate<br/>as (or multiple of) the 5th.</p><p>An example this 2nd point is that a 5/23-comma-meantone triad (with<br/>M3rd 2.8 cents wide) will sound as consonant as a 1/4-comma-meantone<br/>one (with just M3rd), due to its slower-beating 5th (4.68c vs.5.38c<br/>narrow; note that both triads in this example are proportional-<br/>beating).  This is of significance inasmuch as I happen to recall<br/>that another conclusion of that brief test was that the preferred<br/>triad was generally the one in which the 5th had a slower beat rate.<br/>That 0.7-cents-per-fifth saving gives you at least a couple more<br/>cents to play with on the far side of the WT circle.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yet another flaw would be fifths that zig-zag considerably in<br/>size as<br/>&gt; &gt; one goes around the circle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This connects up with my &apos;Werckmeister&apos; critique, since if this<br/>&gt; happens, you&apos;ll get a combination of an impure third and a fifth<br/>which<br/>&gt; is unnecessarily out-of-tune given the size of the third.</p><p>Yep!  Poor Wreckmeister!

It is a<br/>bit unusual in that you&apos;ve favored the flat keys on the near side of<br/>the circle (taking the minor 3rds into account) and the sharp keys on<br/>the far side, but only very slightly.  You might be surprised to<br/>learn that most of your triads (both major &amp; minor) come very close<br/>to being proportional-beating.  This would probably be a good one to<br/>include in the listening test.</p><p>Golly, you know what?  The brats are very similar to this one:</p><p>!

This one also gets most of the triads (both major &amp;<br/>minor) very close to being proportional-beating.  (I also have some<br/>rational versions of this.)</p><p>--George</p></div>
