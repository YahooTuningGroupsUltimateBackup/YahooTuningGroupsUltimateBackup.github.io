My<br/>Steinway uprights have the same length of strings as a 6 foot grand,(except<br/>the very lowest 8 notes or so.)  It is also worth pointing out that the top<br/>note on a spinet has about the same length as a concert grand! ( usually 1<br/>7/8&quot;, maybe 1 15/16&quot;).  The middle and bass sections of spinets do have high<br/>inharmonicity, which really can confuse the ear, but there is always some<br/>beats in there.<br/>  The lack of &quot;clarity&quot;?  I am not certain how this term is being used here,<br/>but usually that means lack of partials and is often the result of dead felt<br/>on the hammers and poor termination at the bridge pin.  As a hammer wears,<br/>the felt gets compacted, which shifts the spectrum toward the higher end,<br/>however, the contact surface also widens which damps the higher partials.<br/>Thus, when the hammers are rock-hard but flat, you get a terrible mix. This<br/>is a condition  more likely found in an upright, since they are usually<br/>allowed to deteriorate farther than their more expensive, horizontal<br/>brethren.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2000 7:55:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, a440a@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16672">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16672</a></p><p>&gt;Ed Foote writes:<br/>&gt; Greetings,<br/>&gt;    Hmm,  I don&apos;t think that the difference in string length is it.<br/>My  Steinway uprights have the same length of strings as a 6 foot<br/>grand, &lt;cut&gt;</p><p>But, a 6-foot grand is rather short, yes??

Steinway only makes two<br/>sizes larger and two sizes smaller. The inharmonic values in the 6 foot range<br/>are low enough that a good electronic tuning machine can calculate a tuning<br/>program that is hard to improve on aurally.

The longer strings (comparing different<br/>length pianos for the same pitch) must actually be tuned tighter,<br/>with a higher tension, yes (??)</p><p>    It is difficult to make that generalization, since the larger pianos<br/>usually have heavier strings.  The length is there for reduction of<br/>inharmonicity and the increase of power.</p><p> &gt;&gt; I am not a professional piano tuner, but did once work for a<br/>professional who ultimately claimed that my tuning technique was best<br/>suited for &quot;jazz&quot; pianos...)&lt;&lt;</p><p>   I would guess that you are tuning a &quot;pure fifths&quot; style. This tends to<br/>stretch the octaves and really heat up the thirds!  I hate it, but use it for<br/>some jazz venues.   The human ear accepts a lot of sharpness in the treble<br/>and this sound is a real &quot;in your face&quot; sensation.  One jazzer told me that<br/>with this tuning, the piano was a real &quot;blowtorch&quot; and he was able to easily<br/>cut through the bar sounds in the club.  Kind of like having a chainsaw on<br/>the front bumper of your car.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d like to know more about this &quot;poor termination at the bridge<br/>pin.&quot; How is it &quot;poor??&quot;  What happens??  I&apos;ve also replaced broken<br/>strings myself... probably to mixed effect... (literally)&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Poor termination is usually due to a loose bridge pin, or a string that is<br/>not firmly seated against the angle formed by the bridge pin and bridge.  A<br/>loose pin allows the string to have two resonant periods, quite close<br/>together, which manifests itself as a false beat.  *this is the &quot;accepted<br/>theory amongst techs, and my own experience hasn&apos;t given me any logical<br/>reason to doubt it.  There have been many instances where I tapped<br/>(carefully) a false beating string down on the bridge and had the note clear<br/>up.  In those cases where this doesn&apos;t help, a very small drop of very thin<br/>superglue at the base of the pin(string held off) will usually do the trick.</p><p>&gt;&gt;However, it seems on some of these &quot;student days&quot; old pianos, the<br/>entire resonance of the instrument created incredible inharmonicity<br/>that interfered with the beating of the strings.  I suppose this is<br/>possible, yes??&gt;&gt;</p><p>   I normally associate the beating with the interval.  The higher<br/>inharmonicity requires that some intervals be compromised in favor of others.<br/>ie, very inharmonic scales on the small spinets require that the fifths or<br/>thirds be less that evenly tuned so that the octaves will still sound right.<br/>   We have just finished our second well tempered  piano CD,(&quot;Six Degrees of<br/>Tonality&quot;) in which we have a Steinway concert grand tuned in six different<br/>tunings. We start with Scarlatti on a 1/4 comma meantone, (inspired by Dave<br/>Hill&apos;s meantone recording projects).  The piano doesn&apos;t sound very lively but<br/>the pure thirds are interesting and smooth.   However,  the next cut is<br/>Mozart on a Prelleur well-tempered tuning of 1732 and the arrival of the<br/>tempering is very evident.<br/>   There is some question of using the Pietro Aaron tuning with such a<br/>Railsback influenced sound, since there was no instrument with this sort of<br/>tension on it when Aaron documented the pure third tuning of the meantone<br/>tunings.  However, life is too short to be fettered by convention!  This is<br/>also the reason that later in the project we present Chopin on a DeMorgan<br/>tuning in which the key characters are reversed from their normal order,<br/>giving the more remote keys the less tempered thirds.

It is built by<br/>Inventronics ( Dr. Albert Sanderson).  I think the web address can be found<br/>with most search engines,  can then begin to refine this template with<br/>repeated use, ultimately arriving at a tuning which doesn&apos;t require further<br/>tweaking.  It will hold 176 such patterns in memory.<br/>   Also, once this &quot;template&quot; is had,  all sorts of data manipulation is ava<br/>ilable.  Not only can the tuning then be shifted into all the documented<br/>temperaments of the past,  it can be lifted or lowered to meet the demands<br/>for A-442 or A-435.   It also allows pianos to have their pitch raised or<br/>lowered far more accurately and easily.<br/>    These machines have filters that allow them to listen to a specific<br/>partial of any given note.  There are a lot of them, used, on the market.  An<br/>Accutuner II may be had for about $700, these days.
