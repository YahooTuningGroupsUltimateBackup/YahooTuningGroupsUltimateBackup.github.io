You can&apos;t imagine how<br/>helpful that was in his &quot;point of it all&quot; message toward an<br/>understanding of the other related posts...  This is just to encourage<br/>the cognocenti to throw these &quot;sops&quot; from time to time in the middle<br/>of a discussion.</p><p>Joe really makes some important points here. I think it would be a big<br/>help if this sort of a &quot;point of it all&quot; approach were to be combined<br/>with (or consolidated to) Joe Monzo&apos;s Dictionary of Tuning Terms. This<br/>way it would all be at one easily accessible place that&apos;s also open to<br/>something like a peer review... in other words, if something relevant<br/>seemed askew, it would probably come up at the TD and eventually get<br/>straightened out. And as Joe&apos;s Dictionary already has (or eventually<br/>will have) most every tuning term or concept your apt to come across<br/>in the back and forth here at the TD, I think it wouldn&apos;t be a<br/>tremendous endeavor to flesh out a few of them with this sort of a<br/>&quot;point of it all&quot; approach... certainly less of an endeavor than<br/>having to start something like a comprehensive FAQ page from<br/>scratch... and I don&apos;t know about anybody else, but I&apos;ve got to be<br/>pretty darn interested in something to wade very deep into the search<br/>engine over at ONElist tuning archive, it&apos;s just to damn slow and user<br/>unfriendly (I think).</p><p>Dan</p></div>
