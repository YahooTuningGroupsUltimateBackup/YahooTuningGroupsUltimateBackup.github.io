Since you seem to agree with<br/>Blackwood in principle, it might be clearer, especially when conversing with<br/>those trained in the Western tradition, to use this terminological<br/>distinction.</p><p>_However_, I part with both you an Blackwood in that I see some fluidity in<br/>what constitutes consonance, depending on musical style. In Gothic music,<br/>for example, a triad was felt to be dissonant, and had to resolve to a<br/>3-limit dyad. In blues and rock the dominant seventh can be used for all the<br/>chords in the I-IV-I-V-IV-I progression, and it has no need to resolve to a<br/>triad. Similarly, much latin jazz in a mixed-minor mode ends on a minor<br/>chord with added major sixth. In this spirit, my paper<br/>(<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>) proposes a new type of<br/>&quot;tonal&quot; music where approximations to 4:5:6:7 and 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 tetrads<br/>can, with enough exposure, become recognized as the canonical &quot;consonances&quot;,<br/>to which other chords would resolve, and compared to which, triads would<br/>sound incomplete.</p></div><h3><a id=11514 href="#11514">ðŸ”—</a>Jay Williams &#x3C;jaywill@tscnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2000 7:37:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 05:40 AM 8/15/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>&gt;[Paul Erlich wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pierre, if these two seventh chords were regarded as consonant, they<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would not have need for resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;I very much disagree!

But this discussion made me thing: &quot;What if the 7th chord that<br/>concludes the Sanctus in the Stravinsky &quot;Mass&quot; or the 11th chord that<br/>concludes the whole piece were tuned as pure intervals?&quot; To my ear they<br/>would be perfectly acceptible as resolved sonorities, in fact, quite<br/>beautiful. As is, in e.t. tuning, they always leave me with a slight<br/>up0in-the-air feeling which I don&apos;t mind, but wonder what Stravinsky<br/>really had in mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You do not need web access to participate.

It may have been true at one point -- hammers hitting the<br/>string 1/7 of the way along their length -- but today&apos;s piano hammers strike<br/>much closer to the end of the string. Anyway, I still suggest your feeling<br/>of a need for resolution is based on excessive [:)] exposure to diatonic<br/>tonal music -- and perhaps most egregiously [:) :) :)], your 7-limit<br/>adaptive retunings of classical pieces, where dominant seventh chords are<br/>deliberately pulled toward 4:5:6:7. Listen to the blues for a while and see<br/>if you still feel that 4:5:6:7 needs to resolve.</p></div><h3><a id=11532 href="#11532">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
