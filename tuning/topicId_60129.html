My first musical memories are of my<br/>mother<br/>playing piano in our home. The only things I remember her playing were<br/>Beethoven&apos;s Moonlight Sonata and Richard Rogers&apos; Slaughter On Tenth<br/>Avenue.</p><p>My first big AHA! experience musically was when I heard the Harry<br/>James pop trumpet single Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White in the<br/>mid 1950s. That motivated me to take trumpet lessons for a year to<br/>learn that particular song, but as soon as I accomplished that, I<br/>dropped it. Brass instruments are still my favorite timbre, as my<br/>MIDI files show! :)</p><p>My next musical love was the Beach Boys. Then in 1967 I discovered<br/>Frank<br/>Zappa, and through him the classical avante-garde. So my period of<br/>greatest record-collecting and listening occured between 1964 and<br/>1970, and was primarily progressive rock.</p><p>I got the film directing bug in 1973 and was involved in that until I<br/>got<br/>disillusioned with it in 1986 or so, and got access to a Macintosh<br/>desktop<br/>compositional setup (Studio Session 6-track/voice composition<br/>software) at Pima Community College West Campus in Tucson, AZ.</p><p>So I suddenly had access to compositional facilities, but had no<br/>conceptual background with which to know where to start, so I studied<br/>all of the music theory that I could get my hands on at the<br/>University of AZ Music Library.</p><p>For some reason I had an affinity for the writings of Pierre Boulez,<br/>so I was drawn to serialism and the 12-tone technique, but was<br/>disappointed in the results I got using it. So I tried 11 intervals,<br/>8-tones and various scales, but I didn&apos;t get anywhere until I read<br/>Allen Forte&apos;s Structure of Atonal Music.</p><p>I should point out that I have a mechanical engineering and drafting<br/>background and cannot sight-read conventional music notation, so the<br/>abstract approach of Forte didn&apos;t bother me that much, and in fact<br/>struck me as more objective than the other people I had been reading.</p><p>The most important concept of Forte&apos;s was the interval class, and I<br/>immediately decided to use only the six smaller forms of the interval<br/>classes (1,2,3,4,5,6 semitones). I knew there were 720 possible<br/>orderings of those (plus 720 inversions), so I thought that was a<br/>manageable volume of melodies to deal with and I wanted to hear those<br/>720 orderings.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are also 64 possible contour orderings for each<br/>of those 720 interval orderings, so I knew I had to try and find a<br/>standard contour ordering so I could objectively compare the<br/>melodies. That&apos;s when I played around with orderings until I<br/>discovered my fractal contour choice ordering mini-algorithm.</p><p>I later realized that my mini-algorithm could also be used to<br/>design/create alternative tuning systems, so that&apos;s why I&apos;m here on<br/>the tuning list.</p><p>Bill Flavell</p></div>
