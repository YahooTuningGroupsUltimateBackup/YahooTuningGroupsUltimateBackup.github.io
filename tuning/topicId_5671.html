This raises the question:<br/>what is the vertical style of the Ives pieces being discussed?</p><p>In tertian music, where major and minor thirds are stable and primary<br/>concords (or &quot;5-limit&quot; music), Pythagorean intonation may, as suggested,<br/>be seen as emphasizing melodic factors (narrow semitones at cadences, for<br/>example) rather than vertical factors (ideally favoring pure thirds).<br/>These two goals are &quot;out of equilibrium&quot; in a 5-limit system, so to speak.</p><p>In quintal/quartal harmony, however, Pythagorean tuning can serve both<br/>melodic ideals (generously wide whole-tones at 9:8, narrow semitones at<br/>256;243) and vertical directedness (thirds and sixths, serving in such a<br/>musical language as &quot;relatively concordant but unstable, have greater<br/>acoustical complexity or tension).</p><p>Of course, either tertian or quintal/quartal music can have sonorities<br/>reflecting the &quot;overtone series&quot;: 2:3:4 and 4:6:9 are in this category<br/>just as much as 4:5:6 or 10:12:15.</p><p>The argument might be made that 5-limit includes _more_ low-numbered<br/>partials than 3-limit, and we might similarly argue that 7-limit is more<br/>&quot;based on the overtone series&quot; than 5-limit, given its recognition of<br/>something like 4:6:7 or 6:7:9 (the last 7-prime-limit, at least, although<br/>9-odd-limit).</p><p>With Ives&apos;s music, I&apos;d wonder about the harmony. If it&apos;s quintal/quartal,<br/>with fifths and fourths as the main concords and maybe thirds and sixths<br/>used as cadential intervals leading to such sonorities (as in medieval<br/>practice), then Pythagorean could be serving vertical as well as melodic<br/>interests. If it&apos;s tertian harmony, then the idea of a melodic rather than<br/>vertical motivation could fit.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/1999 10:59:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Margo Schulter:]<br/>&gt;This raises the question: what is the vertical style of the Ives<br/>pieces being discussed?</p><p>The _Unanswered Question_ operates on three very distinct planes, and<br/>unlike a lot of Ives, the distinct planes are very easy for most<br/>anyone to discern and follow, as they are first and foremost<br/>programmatic planes... but to a certain extent, the _Unanswered<br/>Question_ could also be said to (vertically) stack and (horizontally)<br/>layer three distinct planes, and as such I think that one would be<br/>hard pressed to collapse the whole into some neatly refined analytical<br/>(intonational) equilibrium.</p><p>Ives worked with an extremely broad and inclusive harmonic palette<br/>(see _114 SONGS_), but most of Ives mature output (a phrase I truly<br/>loathe, but one that is commonly used here, and as such would seem<br/>orthographically charitable) seems (to me anyway) to consist of a<br/>vertical style that is more (lacking a better term) &apos;narrative driven&apos;<br/>than anything else... and yet Ives (like most composers) certainly had<br/>his particular harmonic sound, and often times the characteristic<br/>stresses and equilibriums of certain stylistic bold stokes (the rag,<br/>the march, the hymn, etc.) seem to operate as non-harmonically<br/>inclined biographical (auto- and otherwise) projections into that<br/>sound... in other words, while Ives grew up with the rag, and the<br/>march, and understood how they should sound, he tended to use them<br/>symbolically, and this could assume guises as diverse as a more or<br/>less (rote) pictorial interjection (the _Country Band March_ in the<br/>_Hawthorne_ movement of the _Concord_ for example), or as an extremely<br/>integrated gesture (the rags in the _First Piano Sonata_ come to mind,<br/>though the end movement of the second violin sonata is probably my<br/>very favorite Ivesian hymn and rag collision).</p><p>So, while there *is* quantifiable harmonic data aplenty to analyze and<br/>address here, I really think that you would be hard pressed to<br/>effectively (i.e., meaningfully) measure Ives&apos; &quot;vertical style&quot; in an<br/>overly traditional, or historically (intonationally) contextual<br/>manner... for though he was neither traditionally inclined, nor a<br/>(self-conscious) redresser of the traditional in novel new harmonic<br/>cloths; if firmly held to some such analytical measure, he would<br/>probably appear to sit right in some uneasy place between the two...<br/>And while I&apos;m shuddering to think of what a perfectly lousy excuse all<br/>of this must be for answering your question (&quot;what is the vertical<br/>style of the Ives pieces being discussed?&quot;), perhaps it can at least<br/>offer some inkling of the dilemmas that arise when one tries to<br/>categorically square Ives with the question... personally I would<br/>guess (and that&apos;s really all it is, a guess) that most any<br/>straightforward analytical account of Ives &quot;vertical style&quot; is going<br/>to have to end up sectioning off certain aggregates of stylistic<br/>equilibriums, and as such will eventually windup addressing the whole<br/>as some combining of these...</p><p>FWIW, my initial attraction to Ives was purely emotional (he struck a<br/>nerve deep within me as a sort of Sigurd Olson of music), and had<br/>nothing whatsoever to do with any technical particulars... so I have<br/>no doubt that there are others on this list that are much better<br/>suited (in orientation and demeanor) to address this (technical<br/>particulars) than I, and perhaps (hopefully) they will be able to<br/>offer a more advantageous, practical, and orderly answer to your<br/>question.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/1999 9:21:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dan Wolf:]<br/>&gt; I disagree with Dan Stearns here a bit.  The chorale texture of the<br/>strings in _The Unanswered Question_ is can be easily heard as a<br/>single coherent unit, with a tonal, triadic character.  A tuning in<br/>either pythagorean (Johnny Reinhard&apos;s choice -- where the triadic<br/>resolutions will never really resolve) or 5-limit JI (which I&apos;d like<br/>to hear someday) is completely plausible.</p><p>Actually, I still think that we more agree than disagree here, and<br/>that I just haven&apos;t made myself clear enough, so I&apos;ll give it another<br/>try... What I said was: &quot;to a certain extent, the _Unanswered<br/>Question_ could also be said to (vertically) stack and (horizontally)<br/>layer three distinct planes, and as such I think that one would be<br/>hard pressed to collapse the whole into some neatly refined analytical<br/>(intonational) equilibrium,&quot; and that most any straightforward<br/>analytical account of Ives &quot;vertical style&quot; is probably going to end<br/>up sectioning off certain stylistic equilibriums, and eventually<br/>windup addressing the whole as some combining of these... So yes while<br/>it&apos;s easy enough to see the strings of the _Unanswered Question_ in a<br/>couple of a &quot;tonal, triadic&quot; lights, I don&apos;t think that the winds and<br/>trumpet can be so easily collapsed into the same.</p><p>I guess the problem with using the _Unanswered Question_ as a model of<br/>an Ivesian poly-mosteveryting, is that the plains are all so distinct<br/>and (programmatically) obvious (and the entire composite is also not<br/>nearly as dense as most poly-mosteveryting Ives), so while it is much<br/>harder for me to really see the distinct planes of the _Unanswered<br/>Question_ as a singe horizontally layered entity, I do think that this<br/>is more the exception than the norm with Ives, and that the multiple<br/>layers (even if quite clear and distinct) in Ives generally tend to<br/>coalesce into a single Ivesian sound (and here I&apos;m specifically<br/>meaning a vertical sound).</p><p>So as I said before, there certainly *is* quantifiable harmonic data<br/>aplenty here to analyze and address, but I don&apos;t think that you will<br/>be able to effectively (i.e., meaningfully) measure Ives&apos; &quot;vertical<br/>style&quot; by collapsing the whole of it into any one quantifiable<br/>harmonic (or vertical) paradigms.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
