John<br/>deLaubenfels has spent years fine tuning his own software program that<br/>allows for a similar practical adaptive tuning solution for the often<br/>conflicting demands of vertical and horizontal intonation. While John<br/>usually applies his retuning program to single-voice, general MIDI<br/>files from the classical cannon, this short piece of his own, &quot;Dance<br/>Bittersweet&quot;, is my personal favorite of his work.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/373/373474.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/373/373474.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Much like the Hindemith of the late 1920&apos;s, Joseph Pehrson is an<br/>extremely prolific, &quot;practical&quot; composer... give him an instrument or<br/>an ensemble, any instrument or ensemble, and he&apos;ll give you a piece.<br/>This piece was premiered just this last weekend at the American<br/>festival of microtonal music&apos;s annual all day Microthon event. The<br/>guitarist for the premiere and this recording of Pehrson&apos;s &quot;Just In<br/>Time&quot; is Wim Hoogewerf, and the tuning is a curious subharmonic tuning<br/>of Wim&apos;s own design that was inspired by a bit in Hermann Helmholtz&apos;<br/>classic &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/1049/1049481.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/1049/1049481.html</a>&gt;</p><p>In a recent post Neil Haverstick wrote, &quot;I have always been somewhat<br/>puzzled why McLaughlin, with his intense interest in Indian music,<br/>never broke away from 12 eq&quot;.
