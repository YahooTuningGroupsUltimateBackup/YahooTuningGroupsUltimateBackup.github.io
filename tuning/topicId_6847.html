Most of the writings I have looked at<br/>from those times (not comprehensive, but some original writings)<br/>assume just intonation as being the &quot;true&quot; basis for the pitch<br/>structure of music, with temperament - mean tone and later equal<br/>temperament - being a necessary but not ideal slight modification<br/>of the &quot;true harmonies&quot; needed so that the music could be performed<br/>on instruments having a limited number of fixed pitches.  When I&apos;ve<br/>looked at 18th &amp; 19th century books on music - and even some 20th<br/>century ones, the just ratios of musical intervals are laid out in great<br/>detail as being the foundation of musical pitch and harmony.</p><p>    Some which I remember are Rameau&apos;s Treatise on Harmony; Owen&apos;s<br/>Dictionary of the Sciences from the late 1700s quoted in Jorgenson&apos;s<br/>work on tuning in which the author speaks of mean tone tuning as introducing<br/>small errors into the true musical intervals which are perceptible, but<br/>still do not harm the music&apos;s effect; William Pole&apos;s Philosophy of Music<br/>(1879); the first edition of Schoenberg&apos;s Harmonielehre of 1911; A<br/>paper on mean tone temperament for the piano in the Journal of the<br/>Acoustical Society of America which appeared in 1943 which implied<br/>that EQT had defects in that its intervals involved &quot;distortions&quot; of the<br/>&quot;true&quot; intervals.  The author didn&apos;t go into the &quot;distortions&quot; of mean<br/>tone temperament but focussed on the fact that the thirds of mean<br/>tone temperament were not &quot;distorted&quot;.</p><p>    Also, some of these earlier writings imply that much vocal music<br/>was performed in closer to just intonation than equal temperament and<br/>had a different character as a result - a delightful character according<br/>to some of the authors.  No mention was made of singers singing in<br/>mean tone temperament in things I&apos;ve read.</p><p>    Recently, some early cylinder recordings of vocal music recorded<br/>in the late 1800s have been reissued on CD.  Many of the early<br/>recorded quartet songs sound as though the singers were striving for<br/>just intonation.</p><p>    I have not made an exhaustive study of the historical literature,<br/>but most of what I&apos;ve seen has pointed in the direction of just intonation&apos;s<br/>having been assumed without argument as being the natural basis for<br/>musical harmony - especially after the discovery of overtones was<br/>made in the 17th century by Galileo and Mersenne.</p></div><h3><a id=6850 href="#6850">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/1999 7:14:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Most of the writings I have looked at<br/>&gt; from those times (not comprehensive, but some original writings)<br/>&gt; assume just intonation as being the &quot;true&quot; basis for the pitch<br/>&gt; structure of music, with temperament - mean tone and later equal<br/>&gt; temperament - being a necessary but not ideal slight modification<br/>&gt; of the &quot;true harmonies&quot; needed</p><p>preach it brother</p></div><h3><a id=6857 href="#6857">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/11/1999 7:44:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I&apos;d like to put in as my opinion that the intonational system<br/>&gt;a great many musicians - theoreticians, composers, and many<br/>&gt;practicing musicians had in mind was just intonation from the<br/>&gt;1400s up until the 1900s.</p><p>(snip)<br/>&gt;    Also, some of these earlier writings imply that much vocal music<br/>&gt;was performed in closer to just intonation than equal temperament and<br/>&gt;had a different character as a result - a delightful character according<br/>&gt;to some of the authors.

I remember hearing that just thirds first<br/>came out of Britain. Hearing enough european folk music has made me realize<br/>that only the schools of written music were using certain tunings we associate<br/>with it. This was a result of their awareness of Greek and persian writings on<br/>the subject. That enough of this folk music has survived is amazing. That each<br/>city-state might have had its own tuning is quite possible and that the<br/>theorist from town to town might not have agreed any more than we do today. It<br/>is quite possible that certain hubs of JI or any other tuning might have<br/>existed but the music was &quot;inferior&quot; when translated to latter tunings, was<br/>lost or not written down.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6874 href="#6874">ðŸ”—</a>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/11/1999 2:30:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ascend writes:<br/>&gt; the first Western tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; system up to the 1400s was Pythagorean, then there was a<br/>&gt;&gt; brief period when JI may have been the intonational system,<br/>&gt;&gt; then mean tone became the standard tuning system and held<br/>&gt;&gt; sway from the 1500s until the 1700s and 1800s, when it was<br/>&gt;&gt; replaced by equal temperament.</p><p>Greetings,<br/>    While agreeing with Dave&apos;s order I feel the need to submit some<br/>alternatives inre the timing.  Maybe approaching the evolution with less<br/>defined cut-off points?<br/>    I would have considered everything up to maybe 1200 easily defined by the<br/>Pythagorean era, but after that things get murky.<br/>        Walter of Odington wrote in the 14th century that English choirs were<br/>singing harmony that used pure thirds.  I have seen this referred to in other<br/>sources as being one of the first instances on record of the third being<br/>regarded a concord rather than a discord.  If choirs were singing it, I am<br/>going to assume that peasant folksong had been there first. Perhaps the blues<br/>artists of the first millineum?<br/>    It must be assumed that this new resource in vocal music was so<br/>attractive that the added complexity of its use was no deterrent to motet<br/>composers of the time.  Four voice harmony harmony was know by then (Perotin<br/>etal.) and I be we can Get Margo To Tell Us More (GMTTUM) about that?<br/>    Intonationally, instruments seem to have always striven to do what the<br/>voice can do, and fixed pitch instruments had to give up their Just fifths to<br/>get these new thirds to sound so nice.  This was happening in the 1300&apos;s, but<br/>the first accidental had appeared around 1000, so what happened in between is<br/>of some interest.   By 1365, the octave had a full 12 note 7/5 keyboard.  and<br/>it continued on from there before settling back down to what we see today.<br/>     Even though Aaron spelled out 1/4 meantone in 1513, I get the feeling<br/>that it was being used in place of the earlier Pyth. or JI by the Mid 1300&apos;s.<br/> I know that is a bit earlier than most, but the organs of the time don&apos;t<br/>obviate the possibility.<br/>    Meantone could have dropped from use by 1700 on the strung keyboards,<br/>thanks to Werckmiester&apos;s writings and composers desire for more freedom.<br/>However, it lived on in Organs for quite some time after 1800. However,  the<br/>use of ET during  doesn&apos;t have a lot to support it, (except for lutes)<br/>before the late 1800&apos;s.  If the majority of the  Broadwood piano factory<br/>tuners were tuning a well tempered scale in 1885,  it is doubtful that the<br/>man in the field would be attempting the harder and less broadly appreciated<br/>ET).<br/>    So,  I offer the above in support of keyboards being tuned in ET only<br/>since the very late 1800&apos;s.    Some day in the future  it will be the 20th<br/>century that will acquire the status of the ET era.  However,  we are seeing<br/>a new tonal awareness, primarily computer derived, it seems,  and in the<br/>future we will see music being composed in a lot less homoginized format.<br/>Don&apos;t get me wrong,  I love Hoagy Carmichael, Art Tatum, and friends, but ET<br/>neutralizes a lot of the art that had been created in music composed earlier<br/>than 1900. It is just right for some of it, Debussy and Ravel come to mind,<br/>but there is much great stuff from before them that really loses a lot of<br/>beauty in ET.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>(maybe I am just preaching to the choir, I dunno, but I am working on a<br/>well-tempered fifth as I do it.......)</p></div><h3><a id=6909 href="#6909">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
