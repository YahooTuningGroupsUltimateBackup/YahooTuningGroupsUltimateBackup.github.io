For a full<br/>understanding of them you should consult his book,<br/>_Genesis of a Music_.  They occur on a regular<br/>basis in discussions on the Tuning List.</p><p>These terms are also in my microtonal dictionary,<br/>with hyperlinks to other terms that are in the<br/>definitions, on the Sonic Arts website:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval">http://www.ixpres.com/interval</a></p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
