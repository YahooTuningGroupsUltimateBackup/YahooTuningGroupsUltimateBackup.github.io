One &quot;octave&quot;<br/>is still out.</p><p>Yes, presently it is mapped to 55-equal, with 56 keys for each<br/>octave, as I understand it.  The tonics are necessarily duplicated<br/>for each octave.</p><p>This is done through Scala with a new mapping utility that makes it<br/>possible to have the five different segments of the keyboard on five<br/>different midi channels, and have them mapped to different octaves.</p><p>The &quot;generic&quot; mapping for the keyboard is 55-equal, as I understand<br/>it.</p><p>HOWEVER, Joel Mandelbaum wants it mapped to 31-equal and has a<br/>mapping worked out.</p><p>I have just learned that the mapping software was included with the<br/>CD that came with the instrument.  I was not installing that CD, and<br/>was not told of this when it was done.  I think it was done a bit<br/>quickly.</p><p>Apparently, it is possible to affect ANY mapping of the 5-octave,<br/>56 note octave keyboard using this software, so 31 and all the other<br/>meantones should be accomodated.  In fact, I know that Joel<br/>Mandelbaum is concerned in keeping the diatonic keys on the &quot;white<br/>keys&quot; of the instrument.  (I have a photo of the instrument now on<br/>the &quot;photos&quot; area of this website...)</p><p>Joel Mandelbaum at Queens College will, ultimately, be the person to<br/>talk to regarding the microtonal mappings, but they really haven&apos;t<br/>been set up yet, so all of this is preliminary.</p><p>After it&apos;s set up and he is using it, most probably he would welcome<br/>a visit to discuss it and explore other possibilities, although I<br/>cannot speak for him.</p><p>Thanks for the interest!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
