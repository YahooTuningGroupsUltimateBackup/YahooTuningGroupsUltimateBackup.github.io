I didn&apos;t specifically do a 19 vs. 22 comparison,<br/>but I&apos;ve used them both and find their triads quite pleasant. 29-equal is<br/>another tuning with good triads, IIRC.</p><p>12 at first doesn&apos;t sound so bad, because we&apos;re used to hearing it, but<br/>once you hear 41 or 53, and go back to 12, ugh! Of course, I&apos;ve been using<br/>16-equal a lot lately, which is worse than 12 by far in the major triad<br/>comparison, but it has an interesting character of its own that makes up<br/>for its faults, and it can be &quot;tamed&quot; with suitable timbres.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=1748 href="#1748">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
