It is certainly not a<br/>&gt; subset of the stellated 2(4 CPS. If it happens to be a subset of a<br/>&gt; CPS with 2, 4, or 6 more factors, that really wouldn&apos;t be very<br/>&gt; helpful to a composer who&apos;s working only within the 7-limit, now<br/>&gt; would it?<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>In Pascal&apos;s triangle, the 1(4 CPS appears in the same row as the hexany,<br/>therefore it cannot be a subset of the hexany, but it sure is a subset of<br/>the Eikosany.  The limit remark doesn&apos;t make much sense -- the factors in<br/>the CPS are entirely free (i.e. I could make an Eikosany with factors<br/>1,3,5,7,9,15 or 1,3,5,7,9,21 etc.) and one might very well use the 1(4 CPSs<br/>that are subsets of the 2(5 dekany subset of the eikosany without factors<br/>above 7.</p><p>&gt; On the face of it it would seem that there is only one note common to<br/>&gt; both -- 1. What are you leaving out? Are the cross sets transposed in<br/>&gt; some way to create more of an overlap?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yep, I left something out -- Wilson transposes the complementary cross set<br/>by the product of all the factors.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Wilson&apos;s final example, is a stellation of the union of a 2(5 CPS<br/>&gt; &gt;and a 3(5 CPS. He takes a five element cross set, and combines it<br/>&gt; &gt;with the complementary set divided by one of the five elements, thus<br/>&gt; &gt;the five possible solutions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My guess at this point (with extreme ignorance) is that this results<br/>&gt; from the fact that there are five &quot;most compact ways&quot; to construct<br/>&gt; the initial union itself -- the &quot;naive&quot; or &quot;Eulerian&quot; way that takes<br/>&gt; the products in an absolute sense; and then the results of<br/>&gt; multiplying the 2(5 CPS by one of the factors other than 1.</p><p>that&apos;s right.</p><p> &gt; &gt;From the text and my notes to Wilson&apos;s presentation to me 20-some<br/>&gt; &gt;years ago, I have the impression that he arrived at this solution by<br/>&gt; &gt;constructing a styrofoam-ball-and-dowell model.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These would undoubtedly help greatly in grasping (literally and<br/>&gt; figuratively) these structures. It&apos;s too bad e-mail doesn&apos;t allow you<br/>&gt; to portray these things very well.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, for once, Wilson doesn&apos;t even bother to try to graph the thing on<br/>paper...</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2000 6:24:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Paul Erlich &lt;<a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Assuming that the stellation of the 1(4 CPS that I illustrated, and<br/>&gt; &gt; that Manuel referred to (it has 16 notes) agrees with what Wilson<br/>&gt; &gt; intended, I see nothing trivial about it.
