When, on the other hand, you replace the fixed sine tone by a complex tone and do the same experiment with a sufficient number of repetitions and listeners, you will get a multi-peaked distribution. If the complex tone is a harmonic complex tone (such as of a musical instrument) the majoritiy of matches will occur at the complex tone&apos;s fundamental frequency. However, additional peaks of the distribution will occur at frequencies that may be both harmonic and subharmonic with respect to the complex tone&apos;s fundamental frequency.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>JG: This looks like an argument for the &quot;virtual fundamental&quot; which notes the non-absolute nature of results supporting it.

This kind of similarity, i.e., sensory affinity, emerges from the fact that the pitch of any complex tone is multiple (see topic definition of pitch). As a consequence of the multiplicity of pitch, and of the particular intervals that exist between the simultaneous pitches of any single harmonic complex tone, there occurs commonality of pitches when the oscillation frequencies of two successive harmonic complex tones are in a 1:2 or 2:3 ratio. Commonality means that one of the tones has some pitches in common with the other, and this immediately accounts for an enhanced similarity of the tones as compared to other frequency ratios, i.e., for sensory affinity. &gt;&gt;</p><p>So what do *you* think Terhardt means by &quot;multiplicity of pitch&quot;?</p><p>Curiously,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=32358 href="#32358">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2002 8:58:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So, what *is* &quot;multiplicity of pitch&quot;?

This<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; term<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denotes the phenomenon that successive harmonic complex tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i.e., only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harmonic complex tones, are more similar to one another when<br/>&gt; their<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oscillation frequencies are in a 1:2 or 2:3 relationship, than<br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not. This kind of similarity, i.e., sensory affinity,<br/>&gt; emerges<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact that the pitch of any complex tone is multiple (see topic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; definition<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of pitch). As a consequence of the multiplicity of pitch, and<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular intervals that exist between the simultaneous<br/>&gt; pitches of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single harmonic complex tone, there occurs commonality of<br/>&gt; pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; when the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oscillation frequencies of two successive harmonic complex<br/>&gt; tones<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1:2 or 2:3 ratio. Commonality means that one of the tones has<br/>&gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in common with the other, and this immediately accounts for an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; enhanced<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; similarity of the tones as compared to other frequency ratios,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i.e., for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sensory affinity. &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what do *you* think Terhardt means by &quot;multiplicity of<br/>&gt; pitch&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; By &quot;commonality&quot;, Terhardt means _not_ coincidences between<br/>&gt; actual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; physically present sine wave components, but rather coincidences<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; between possible co-existing alternative _pitch interpretations_<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the sensations present.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: Where is that indicated in Terhardt&apos;s web documents<br/>&gt; &gt; (other than directly below in your quote)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you read them all?

Gill and Bob<br/>Wendell misinterpreted as referring to overtones:</p><p>from <a href="http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/virtualp.html">http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/persons/ter/top/virtualp.html</a></p><p>&apos;For example, when three Fourier components with the frequencies 600,<br/>800, and 1000 Hz are heard, the auditory system is wise enough to<br/>know that &quot;in real life nothing is just what it appears to be&quot;. That<br/>is, not only the spectral pitches corresponding to 600, 800, and 1000<br/>Hz are apprehended, but it is supposed that these components are<br/>likely to be harmonics of a complex tone the lower harmonics of which<br/>have been attenuated or even removed by linear distortion of the<br/>sound path. So it is advisable to look out for the fundamental pitch<br/>of that prospective complex tone. This is done by assuming<br/>subharmonic virtual pitches of each of the spectral pitches to be<br/>candidates of the unknown fundamental pitch. In terms of frequency,<br/>those subharmonics are simply obtained by dividing every component<br/>frequency by each of the integer numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on, until<br/>about 12. Then the test of subharmonic match comes into play.<br/>Obviously, in the above example, a first &quot;full match&quot; is obtained at<br/>the fundamental frequency 200 Hz, as this is the 3rd subharmonic of<br/>600 Hz, the fourth subharmonic of 800 Hz, and the fifth subharmonic<br/>of 1000 Hz. By definition, such a match amplifies the relative<br/>prominence which is assigned to any of the virtual-pitch candidates,<br/>such that the above &quot;full match&quot; will yield a well pronounced virtual<br/>pitch at 200 Hz. However, another &quot;full match&quot; is obtained at 100 Hz,<br/>and since this also is an oscillation frequency that frequently<br/>occurs in real life, it is considered as an alternative virtual pitch<br/>that competes in prominence with the former one. This is how both<br/>multiplicity of virtual pitch, and pitch-commonality (see topics tone<br/>affinity, octave equivalence) of harmonic complex tones come about.&apos;</p></div>
