I&apos;m passing your message along to a couple of others in Oz who might be interested as well as to Dave and Paul.</p><p>  I would suggest that you subscribe to the tuning list <a href="/tuning/">/tuning/</a>  where you could potentially reach everyone who might have an interest in what&apos;s going here.</p><p>  Regards,</p><p>  Robin</p><p><a href="mailto:schiemer@uow.edu.au">schiemer@uow.edu.au</a> wrote:<br/>  Dear Robin,</p><p>Nice to hear from you.</p><p>The &apos;scene&apos; - if there is such a thing - has been around for some time here in the person of Warren Burt, arguably one of the most knowledgeable on the subject. Warren is about to take up an ARC Post Doc award in a new 3-year ARC project that I&apos;m leading &quot;Investigating performing and listening strategies for microtonal composition&quot;. Other members of the ARC team include Emery Schubert (UNSW), Graham Hair (Glasgow) and Richard Parncutt (Graz).</p><p>But along with Warren, there are a few others at Wollongong including myself who are also pushing in the same direction.</p><p>Terumi Narushima has explored various microtonal systems such as polychordal scales of John Chalmers through sound installations, film music and collaboration with the Asmaradana Gamelan in Singapore represented by Joyce Teo and Damien Lock.</p><p>Michael Dixon, a composer performer has been address microtonal composition from the angle of a profesional horn player.</p><p>Christiaan van der Vyver has purpose-built several instruments including the xenophone and unfretted slide guitars to explore new tuning systems.</p><p>Mark Havryliv has been involved in tuning through sound synthesis and java applications he developed collaboratively with me on a previous ARC project, the Pocket Gamelan. Like Dave K, Mark has some experience with AVR microcontrollers.</p><p>And John Spence, though not involved in systematic tuning, has just succeeded using Pure Data in getting a network performance interface where the system tracks the players&apos; intonation.</p><p>It would be nice to find a way to connect people on this list with your self, Dave Keenan, Paul Wakefield (if this is who I believe, then he studied here over the last few years) and others. For this reason I&apos;ve copied my reply to everyone. If any of us happen to be doing a gig in your area, it will be possible for us to make contact.</p><p>Can you also forward this to Dave and Paul.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Greg S</p></div>
