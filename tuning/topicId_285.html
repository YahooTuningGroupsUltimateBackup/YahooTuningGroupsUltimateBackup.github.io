Each of the meantone scales can be divided<br/>into<br/>&gt;five whole steps and two half steps, which can be arranged in a<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt;scale.

Only in the meantone tunings can a diatonic scale have six<br/>consonant triads. Also, the unequal whole steps of 15 and 22 sound poor<br/>when used in succession melodically.</p><p>&gt;The remaining scales either have relatively small<br/>&gt;fifths (such as 16-tet and multiples of 7-tet) or relatively large<br/>fifths<br/>&gt;(such as 18-tet and multiples of 5-tet).</p><p>&gt;group I (meantone): 12, 19, 24, 26, 31, 36, 38, 43, 45, 50, ...<br/>&gt;group II: 15, 22, 27, 29, 34, 39, 41, 46, 48, 53, ...<br/>&gt;group III: 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 21, 23, 28, 33, 35, 40, 47, 52, ...<br/>&gt;group IV: 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18, 20, 25, 30, 32, 37, 42, 44, 49, 51,<br/>...</p><p>&gt;(although 17-tet seems to me more similar to the first two groups than<br/>to<br/>&gt;any of the other scales in the last group).</p><p>There are many criteria for classifying equal-tempered scales, such as<br/>the consistency limits which I have discussed before and the diameter<br/>measures proposed by Paul Hahn. Putting those aside, Miller&apos;s system is<br/>good; I would prefer instead a more hierarchical classification. I stop<br/>at 34-tET because beyond that the distinctions begin to blur (e.g., one<br/>can use two different sizes of fifth to construct pentatonic scales in<br/>35-tET). First, I would isolate the scales with fifths worse than those<br/>of 5-tet (which I think are just usable with most timbres):</p><p>group I: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 23</p><p>Group II would have all other ETs within it; they all have acceptable<br/>pentatonic scales, although the multiples of 5 have equipentatonic<br/>scales which are quite special due to their symmetry (and consequent<br/>propensity for atonality):</p><p>group IIA: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30</p><p>Within that group the only multiples of 15 have good triads and contain<br/>symmetrical 6-tone and 10-tone scales rich in those triads:</p><p>group IIA1: 5, 10, 20, 25<br/>group IIA2: 15, 30</p><p>Now all other ETs have good pentatonic scales of two step sizes:</p><p>group IIB: 7, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34</p><p>Of these, the multiples of 7 have equiheptatonic scales:</p><p>group IIB1: 7, 14, 21, 28</p><p>of which only 28 has consonant triads and symmetrical octatonic scales<br/>rich in those triads:</p><p>group IIB1a: 7, 14, 21<br/>group IIB1b: 28</p><p>The rest have heptatonic scales (defined Pythagoreically) with two step<br/>sizes:</p><p>group IIB2: 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33</p><p>which can be subdivided into those where the &quot;Pythagorean&quot; heptatonic<br/>scales do not have consonant triads:</p><p>group IIB2a: 17, 22, 27, 29, 32, 33</p><p>and those where they do:</p><p>group IIB2b: 12, 19, 24, 26, 31 (this is Miller&apos;s meantone group again<br/>-- I hesitate in calling 24 meantone, though; perhaps &quot;double meantone&quot;<br/>is more appropriate for 24.)</p><p>One can divide group IIB2a into ETs without good 5-limit triads:</p><p>group IIB2a(1): 17, 32, 33</p><p>and those with good triads:</p><p>group IIB2a(2): 22, 27, 29</p><p>While all three in this group have passable 7-limit tetrads, only 22 has<br/>10-note scales with two step sizes rich in consonant 7-limit tetrads:</p><p>group IIB2a(2)(a): 27, 29<br/>group IIB2a(2)(b): 22</p><p>Once can divide group IIB2b into ETs without consonant 7-limit tetrads:</p><p>group IIB2b(1): 12, 19, 24</p><p>and those with good tetrads:</p><p>group IIB2b(2): 26, 31</p><p>In this group only 26 had 14-note scales with two step sizes rich in<br/>consonant 7-limit tetrads:</p><p>group IIB2b(2)(a): 31<br/>group IIB2b(2)(b): 26</p><p>That completes the classification of ETs under 35. While most other<br/>scales have analogues within those ETs, some do not, such as Keenan&apos;s<br/>scale, or 17-limit JI, or non-octave scales.</p></div>
