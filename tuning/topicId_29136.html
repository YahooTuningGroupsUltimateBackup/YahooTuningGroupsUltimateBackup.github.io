Minor thirds give excellent approximations of a<br/>just 13:11 (~289.21 cents), while major thirds aren&apos;t too far from<br/>14:11 (~417.51 cents).</p><p>Cadential resolutions featuring major thirds expanding to fifths, and<br/>minor thirds contracting to unisons, have concise diatonic semitones<br/>of 2/29 octave, or ~82.76 cents, considerably narrower and more<br/>efficient than in 12-tET.</p><p>We also get diminished fourths and augmented seconds at 9/29 octave<br/>and 8/29 octave, around 372.41 cents and 331.03 cents. These approach<br/>the region of 21:17 (~365.83 cents) and 17:14 (~336.13 cents), while<br/>also on the outskirts of the region of 5:4 (~386.31 cents) and 6:5<br/>(~315.64 cents).</p><p>Typical progressions involving these intervals resolve by a melodic<br/>motion of a chromatic semitone (3/29 octave, ~124.14 cents) in one or<br/>more of the voices, as with the outer voices of this example (here C4<br/>shows middle C):</p><p>         Bb3  B3<br/>         F#3  E3<br/>         Eb3  E3</p><p>Both families of 29-tET thirds found in a regular 12-note tuning are<br/>rather complex and active, lending themselves to neo-Gothic cadential<br/>progressions.</p><p>Renaissance music, or other styles based on ratios of 5, would suggest<br/>to me a different type of tuning, with 31-tET or 1/4-comma meantone an<br/>obvious choice. These tunings divide the whole-tone into five equal or<br/>nearly equal parts, but in a very different way.</p><p>With a larger set of 29-tET, we get another family of intervals which<br/>is one of the special attractions: intervals very close to 15:13<br/>(~247.74 cents), 13:10 (~454.21 cents), and 26:15 (952.26 cents) --<br/>somewhere between the familiar categories of major second and minor<br/>third; major third and fourth; and major sixth and minor seventh.</p><p>These intervals have 29-tET approximations at 6/29 octave (~248.28<br/>cents), 11/29 octave (~455.17 cents), and 23/29 octave (~951.72<br/>cents).</p><p>Here there&apos;s scope for much fun and creativity: is that near-15:13 a<br/>large major second that might expand to a fourth, or a small minor<br/>third about to contract to a unison? Similarly, will that near-26:15<br/>act like a large and expansive major sixth seeking the octave, or a<br/>small minor seventh seeking contraction to a fifth?</p><p>Using an asterisk (*) to show a note raised by a diesis of 1/29 octave<br/>or 1/5-tone, I&apos;ll give an example of these alternate resolutions:</p><p>       D3   C4     D3  D*3<br/>       B*3  C4     B*3 A*3<br/>       E*3  F3     E*3 D*3<br/>               or</p><p>In the first resolution, the E*3-B*3-D3 sonority at a rounded<br/>0-703-952 cents acts like an outer minor seventh contracting to a<br/>fifth and an upper minor third contracting to a unison.</p><p>In the second, the same sonority suggests an outer major sixth<br/>expanding to an octave and an upper major second expanding to a<br/>fourth.</p><p>One thing in common between 29-tET and 24-tET is that both tunings<br/>offer this kind of family of intervals -- precisely 250, 450, and 950<br/>cents in 24-tET.</p><p>For whatever reason, I&apos;ve noticed that lots of discussions of 29-tET<br/>tend to approach it from other perspectives; but I&apos;d say that the<br/>general &quot;accentuated Pythagorean&quot; structure, the rather gentle<br/>&quot;submajor/supraminor&quot; thirds, and the intervals about midway between<br/>usual Pythagorean or 12-tET categories that I&apos;ve just described, all<br/>contribute to a &quot;mood&quot; for the tuning.</p><p>Take all of these features together with the near-just fifths,<br/>tempered by only about 1.49 cents in the wide direction, and we have a<br/>very impressive and beautiful tuning, one deserving lots of<br/>enthusiastic advocacy.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
