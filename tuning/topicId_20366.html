Give a typical price if possible.</p><p>I&apos;ve been quite happy with my Sound Blaster PCI 512.  I might hesitate to use it&apos;s analog input for<br/>professional work - you really need digital I/O for that these days, anyway - but it sounds far better<br/>than the $15 card that came with my system.  It&apos;s wavetables are decent, overall, and user modifiable.<br/>It has good clarity and imaging, and the low end is solid (if you have a subwoofer to hear it).</p><p>You can d-load free software for it (Vienna Sound Font Studio) from Creative&apos;s site, that turns it into<br/>a flexible and user-friendly sampler, including the ability to tune each sample independently over a<br/>range of +/- 10 octaves in 1 cent increments.  So that&apos;s not all bad.  Of course, you need plenty of RAM<br/>to use large sample sets.  I think it maxes out at 32 Megs.  You probably need at least 128 installed in<br/>order to have 32 free while running music software.  There are also compatible Sound Fonts available for<br/>the d-loading at Creative&apos;s site and all over the web.</p><p>I think I paid about $70 for it at Best Buy.  You could probably do better if you searched the web and<br/>waited for a deal.  I had to replace mine immediately one day when my old card died.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
