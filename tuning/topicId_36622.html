The ear is not your<br/>&gt; &gt; imagination and if your imagination is its unfortunate indentured<br/>&gt; &gt; servant, surely that&apos;s a sad thing.</p><p>All perception is inseparable from the imagination since memory is the main supplier of data.?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it not true that Kraig Grady has some pieces where he really<br/>&gt; slaves and slaves over the *tuning* and then lets the pieces take off<br/>&gt; rather &quot;automatically&quot; after that??</p><p>well you are not i trouble here<br/>I can&apos;t say i slave over tunings in that i have only used a few (less than maybe 12 in twice that<br/>many years).</p><p>    I will say that i recognize a tuning as an expressive element of a composition and also that<br/>each tuning or class of tunings has certain structural possibilities. On the other hand I have<br/>slave over the  possibilities of my main tunings for i had to build instruments  since for years<br/>there was absolutely no way else for me to hear any of it otherwise.</p><p>    The priority was tunings with the least amount of notes that does the most of what i wanted to<br/>do. Every step has been filled with discoveries that sometimes took years. And compositions that<br/>might last a 40 minutes although existing on a single pizza box size score is the result of many<br/>trials and errors because working in a new tuning you discover things that have never been thought<br/>about in music before. I am sure early electronic people felt likewise.</p><p>    These compositions take off by themselves in the same way Bach could recognize the potential<br/>of his themes and then let them &quot;automatically&quot; run as fugues. I am guilty of using tuning to<br/>construct music &quot;outside of time&quot; which is maybe what Dan means above.</p><p>Tuning determines what you can and cannot do. One has only to look at free improv as practiced by<br/>those not as aware as a Reinhard and you end up with 12 underneath it all.<br/>The same with so much electronic music.</p><p>    Tuning is as much the fence as the palette of your tone imagination. Yet our imagination can<br/>create things like a game of Chess which might be simple on the surface , but quickly grows to a<br/>level of depth unforeseen at the beginning. Hopefully this is what we will learn to door at least<br/>recognize it when it does happen!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig voting for Columbia would be a little like John Cage liking<br/>&gt; Beethoven...</p><p> I think he liked beethoven but just wanted to hear it all at one time.<br/> I AM AGAINST COLUMBIA  AND CHANGE MY VOTE FOR TOPICA.<br/>a feldman list is there and it seems good!</p><p>And now a shameless plug!!!!!!!</p><p>PICTURE FROM UPCOMING SHADOW PLAY!
