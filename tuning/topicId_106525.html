The octave remains the same, 81/40.<br/>Please listen to my demo on Youtube.<br/>Regards,Linus<br/>Mendelssohn violin piece played with violin tuned (Hz):E : 669.00; A : 446.00; D : 293.66; G : 195.778Some violinists are seen tuning up their G-strings in a concert, I am doing the exact opposite. The &quot;standard&quot; violin tuning (exact 3/2 P5&apos;s) is E 660, A 440, D 293.33, G 195.56. Each string down is 1.96 cent against the &quot;ET&quot; scale. Violinists do this to compensate for the 1.96 x 2 cent error against a supposedly 2:1 ocatve, ET <a href="http://piano.In">piano.In</a> the 80&apos;s I proposed the 81:40, 1221.5 cent octave which I named &quot;Stretch Octave&quot;. It has subsequently been proven scientifically (1) that the music octave as perceived by the listener is about 1220 cent.&nbsp;Here I postulate the reason why the octave is 1221.5 cent : &nbsp;consider the whole tone as 9:8 (as the &quot;Pythagoras Scale&quot;). Stack six of these together, and it makes 1,223 cents - complies with the finds of the scientists (about 20 cents bigger than the 2:1 octave). Apparently, the ear likes to construct the octave according to the size of this 9:8 interval.I therefore call this tuning system &quot;Pseudo-Equal&quot;.Re &quot;Quantum&quot; intonation&quot; - in contrast to &quot;Pure&quot; intonation. I noticed that the ear is actually also sensitive to complication ratios, contrast to the old belief that ratios need to be &quot;simple&quot;. Therefore ratios which are &quot;relevant&quot; in music are just numerous. This recording is a example to illustrate this &quot;fact&quot;.&quot;Stretched&quot; music &quot;needs&quot; an &quot;ET&quot; accompaniment. Instead of contradiction, the &quot;Stretch&quot; scale consists the 4/3 tetrachord, which agrees with ET (with small error). Because of the small size of the &quot;half-tone&quot;, the lower note in the &quot;half-tone&quot; step sounds a tiny &quot;sharp&quot;, the upper one a little &quot;flat&quot;. This is how the &quot;sensation&quot; in music comes about, or how the &quot;leading note&quot; gets &quot;resolved&quot;.&nbsp;In the very last double stop of this piece are the two notes, F# on high position, against an open D (presently, 293.66), a terrifying endeavour theoretically impossible to be in tune. The old school says the F# is 734.16 Hz (pure, under a 446A, 293.66 x 5 / 2), otherwise, 740 Hz (ET). Present recording plays F# at 743.34 Hz with an not-so-simple ratio of 9/8 * 9/8 * 81/40. Notice in particular, the double stop immediately prior plays this same F# with the D a &quot;Stretched Octave&quot; higher than the open D (interval = 9/8 * 9/8), &nbsp;Both these intervals sound &quot;pure&quot;. &nbsp;The postulate is, any interval any multiples of the syntonic comma, 81/80, sounds pure or significant. In short, any interval which sounds in tune are, by default, significant. Hence this name &quot;Quantum&quot;.The note D tuned at 193.66 is an attempt to render this last note same as the D on the ET,440 piano. A at 446 adapts the tuning to the &quot;Stretched&quot; environment.(1) OCTAVE DISCRIMINATION: TEMPORAL AND CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS Lola L. Cuddy and Peter A.

This is not so straight forward as just putting in whatever interval any &quot;rule&quot; that exists. Just beats before, the F# was as high as 752.63 Hz, but the falling pattern causes the intonation to fall towards the ending. That should be why the end feels kind of &quot;settling down&quot;. For sure the music will not sound right if the intonations are wrong, but errors in the calculations can go un-noticed, especially when I only pick up this hobby for just few moments between long lapse of weeks, months or sometimes, years.</p><p> There is probably still a long way before anyone can &quot;figure out&quot; the intonation from any &quot;rule&quot;, &quot;formula&quot;, &quot;pattern&quot;, whatever. What I can for sure say is, there is a long way trying to figure how how the ear, the mind, the heart functions to somehow &quot;feel&quot; a note is in &quot;correct&quot; intonation, but one thing is for sure. Intonation must be forever changing  throughout any piece of music that makes music what it is.</p><p> Rgds,<br/> Linus</p></div>
