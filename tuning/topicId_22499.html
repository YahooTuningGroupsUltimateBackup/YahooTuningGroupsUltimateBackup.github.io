A great example is Lou Harrison&apos;s &quot;Simfony in Free<br/>Style&quot; (1955), which was premiered at Microthon 2001.  (It will be broadcast<br/>on New Sounds on May 18th in New York and on the web at 11 P.M. on 93.9 FM.<br/>Others to be broadcast Ivor Darreg, David Eggar, Paul Erlich, Marc Jones,<br/>Uruguayan Jazz &apos;ala Sabat-Garibaldi&apos;s Dinarra, and my horn solo &quot;Ultra.&quot;)</p><p>Lou&apos;s notation gives ratios BETWEEN notes so that one melodically measures<br/>distance.  This descriptive notation was impossible to perform prescriptively<br/>and so there have never been any performances.  The AFMM concert featured<br/>rewritten parts conducted by Nathan Fuhr and including 12 players.<br/>Substitutions were acceptable to the composer if we could guarantee the<br/>tuning.  That&apos;s the easy part for us, but inexplicable to those outside the<br/>AFMM experience.</p><p>The publishers were upset at first, misunderstanding completely the<br/>difference between a readable part and an unreadable part.  Truly, I am not<br/>talking about opinion here, just a reality.  It&apos;s a lovely piece and I am<br/>proud of its premier performance.  As we all should know, not every piece is<br/>100% in its first performance, but we got lucky.  If we didn&apos;t rewrite and<br/>convince the publishers of this need, I believe the piece would remain<br/>dormant.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=22504 href="#22504">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2001 9:21:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/11/01 11:42 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; (It will be broadcast on New Sounds on May 18th in New York<br/>&gt; and on the web at 11 P.M. on 93.9 FM.</p><p>Right here on the little ol&apos; web eh?</p><p>WNYC-FM 93.9 streams through:</p><p><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/audioindex/wnycfm.asx">http://www.wnyc.org/audioindex/wnycfm.asx</a></p><p>&quot;asx&quot; format is readable by Windows Media Player;<br/>use the &quot;Open URL&quot; command and paste the address.<br/>If you don&apos;t have Windows Media Player, you can download it at:</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/en/download/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/en/download/default.asp</a></p><p>Marc</p></div>
