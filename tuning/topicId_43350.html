That explains also<br/>his plain and simple language).<br/>The purpose of organ music (improvisation not &quot;repertoire&quot;) was<br/>not mainly to play &quot;chromatically&quot;. Bach got critisized for<br/>that (in Arnstadt; well known), not merely from a unreflected<br/>conservatism of his critics, but because he went beyond the<br/>limits of the function of the organ and organ playing in its<br/>social and liturgical context. So it can be seen a conflict<br/>between his artistic will and the needs of parishes, the church.<br/>The exceptions he formed in this were especially noted, like in<br/>Arnstadt or rather late in his life, wehn he performed<br/>(improvised!) Altenburg.<br/>And many of his works (what we see as &quot;repertoire&quot; today) are<br/>not especially chromatic.</p><p>&gt; The inflexibility of organ tuning mitigates for a single<br/>&gt; organ tuning, and Werckmeister III is singularly admirable.</p><p>Admiration should not play a part in the scientific evaluation<br/>of sources, evidence and facts.<br/>I also admire Bach, Werckmeister, Buxtehude, Vallotti, Walther<br/>etc. - but therefore I&apos;m especially careful to avoid value<br/>judgements from my preference as much as possible.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  Any organ composition that used an Ab is likely to be<br/>&gt;&gt; well-tempered since G# was the more usual key allocation<br/>&gt;&gt; in meantone.</p><p>There are not just a few examples in which the the meantone G#<br/>can be taken as a &quot;septimal&quot; A-flat. But that is and was a<br/>matter of preference.<br/>We find a-flat&apos;&apos; for example in Matthias Weckman[n]&apos;s works. The<br/>Jakobi-organ in Hamburg, which he played, had before Schnitger<br/>split keys in the R&uuml;ckpositiv (se my forthcoming article, now in<br/>Print, in &quot;GOArt Research Reports, Vol. 3, advertised on our<br/>website).  And as usual the &quot;splits&quot; went up only to<br/>e-flat&apos;&apos;/d#&apos;&apos;. So when he wrote the piece in which he makes use<br/>of the non existing a-flat&apos;&apos; he could only expect the septimal<br/>sound of a g#&apos;&apos; instead.<br/>That leaves the following possiblities:<br/>- Either Weckman[n] accepted the simple &quot;must&quot;, however<br/>   willingly/unwillingly we don&apos;t know, nor can we<br/>   conclude from anything around him.<br/>- He composed it for another organ (no indication)<br/>- He didn&apos;t write it in view of a specific performance</p><p>And on the other hand we have reports about organists from the<br/>time until far into the 18th century, who played b-major chords<br/>or f-minor on meantone organs. Sure, sometimes they got<br/>critisized by other organists or musicians, musical theorists -<br/>but, sometimes not. So there were those who accepted it, may be<br/>even liked it (for the sake of an obscure &quot;expression&quot;?) and<br/>those who didn&apos;t accept - sounds pretty much familiar.<br/>Preferences then, preferences now.<br/>I have heard one of the famous 20th century harpsichordist<br/>playing an f-minor passacaglia on a meantone tuned instrument in<br/>a festival concert after a break - he didn&apos;t retune the a-flats<br/>or d-flats, occuring frequently in the music.  I had severe<br/>&quot;problems&quot; during that piece, a few others too. But there were<br/>other musicians and connaisseurs who liked it. It was Gustav<br/>Leonhardt playing around 1990: now was he right or wrong, was I<br/>right or wrong, or those who argued with what they perceived as<br/>musical &quot;expression&quot;?<br/>Judging the historical situation from our instilled preferences<br/>does not have any validity for the research of the historical<br/>and highly complex situation, which in this respect was as<br/>chaotic then as it was now.</p><p>I have recorded examples of a bunch of Buxtehude-Preludes in<br/>1/4-s.c.-meantone without using any split keys (i. e. playing g#<br/>when a-flat stands, e-flat in places of a d#-note, etc.) and<br/>with contemporary (and varying) registrations. I played the<br/>recording to some of the foremost Buxtehude-researchers<br/>recently, plus ca. 30 other people highly experienced in<br/>HIP-performance and research (and I didn&apos;t &quot;prepare&quot; them):<br/>All agreed on that it was &quot;playable&quot;, and especially from the<br/>Buxtehude researchers came no objection. And the few passages<br/>critisized by a few of the others (then mainly organists!), were<br/>different - in other words: each pointed to different passages,<br/>than his/her colleagues. The judgement on playability/<br/>unplayability,  suitability (or opposite) doesn&apos;t tell anything<br/>therefore about what temperament might or might not be suitable<br/>or &quot;good&quot;. It is a personal preference, from which no conclusion<br/>on the historic situation can be drawn, as it has been done over<br/>and over until now (and probably will be done in future -<br/>similar to the obviously impossible task to speak against the<br/>myth of Werckmeister inventing ET and Bach writing the WTC for<br/>it), because even well-trained musicologists couldn&apos;t withhold<br/>their preferences, and didn&apos;t notice them - even less biased<br/>20th or 21st century musicians.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: I appreciate your musicianship. But what exactly<br/>&gt;&gt; do you need the ttravels then for, if you already from<br/>&gt;&gt; your excellence as musician believe to be able to draw<br/>&gt;&gt; conclusions about the history of temperament practice?</p><p>&gt; JR: You are putting words into my mouth (yech).</p><p>No, as you see from the  &quot;?&quot; it was a question?</p><p> &gt;  I draw no conclusions by making musical performances alone.</p><p>I didn&apos;t say that, but you let you guide from your personal<br/>musical perception. You come to a conviction by modern practice</p><p>&gt; At best, they are the satisfactory</p><p>But, what about those, who might be not satisfied with your<br/>performance? Are they &quot;nuts&quot;, &quot;uneducated&quot;, a coalition of the<br/>&quot;unwilling&quot;?</p><p>&gt; result of much research.  If you would be a bit patient,<br/>&gt; I will respond to your points, while making a few of my own.</p><p>Welcome, will be interesting if there will be and what kind of<br/>evidence as the subject line proudly stated.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: As a musician I believe, that we can&apos;t get enough<br/>&gt;&gt; historical information - and then make an artistic decision<br/>&gt;&gt; when it comes to the performance. Usually we have only a<br/>&gt;&gt; fraction of the knowledge of a specific historic situation<br/>&gt;&gt; or historic condition. It can&apos;t  be expressed in numbers,<br/>&gt;&gt; but as a magnitude or proportion, one reasonably will not<br/>&gt;&gt; exceed more than 1% of the total necessary</p><p>[IO added]  and (once) available</p><p>&gt;&gt; knowledge. This means that in the magnitude of 99 % &quot;modern&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; thoughts, prejudices and preferences will come into any<br/>&gt;&gt; performance, making any performance automatically a modern<br/>&gt;&gt; performance.</p><p>&gt; JR: That is a bleak assessment in my judgment.  Using numbers<br/>&gt; allows for accuracy to 1200 cents to the octave.  This puts<br/>&gt; all temperaments on the same table, for easy cross<br/>&gt; examination.</p><p>&gt;  The music is the form that results, and is the ultimate<br/>&gt; reason for your research.</p><p>No, I&apos;m not primary researching for the music.<br/>And before someone might misunderstand me as &quot;dry musicologist&quot;:<br/>As I pointed out before I don&apos;t see it as the task of musicology<br/>to provide &quot;usable&quot; knowledge. Everyone in science must know<br/>that research which serves a purpose will mainly tending towards<br/>delivering the results, which are expected to be usable. For<br/>example when the chocolate industry will ask and pay for<br/>researching of the health effects of chocolate, we&apos;ll hear in<br/>the news, that a recent study showed &quot;scientifically&quot; that<br/>eating loads of chocolate has  - at least - no effects on health<br/>or even is advisable.</p><p>I see my task as a music historian:  Finding as much sources,<br/>evidence, (simple?) facts as possible, having a very wide scope<br/>from the beginning and making exactly clear, where the<br/>boundaries are in which my personal preferences might come in.<br/>To avoid the personal misbeliefs, prejudices etc.  as much as<br/>possible, I not only do scrutinize my own reasoning again and<br/>again, but give my papers to colleagues who know the field,<br/>before I publish, and I get very helpful critics - and revise a<br/>lot, when better evidene or sources are peresented. No problems<br/>with that at all - I&apos;m dealing with science, not taste.  The<br/>largest part in scientific work is taking away taste and<br/>prejudice - I know, this is against much what so-called<br/>&quot;New-Musicology&quot; is about, in which the &quot;narrative&quot; (jargon<br/>word for &quot;story&quot; - but that could be too easily understood by<br/>&quot;non-scientists&quot;) is to day often seen more important than<br/>to rely on sources, evidence and facts.  To include a chapter<br/>on some modern philosopher is also often more important than to<br/>be able to handle the (not simple) craft of our profession<br/>inasmuch it has to do with history (and musical &quot;archaeology&quot;).<br/>Frequently researchers like me are also attacked with the<br/>primitive &quot;positivism&quot;-club - I have got plenty of buffer to<br/>cope with more of that if it comes (and it will come, I&apos;m sure).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: At the same time this makes performance always<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;artistic&quot;, beyond science or scientific consideration.<br/>&gt;&gt; In other words: I don&apos;t want to hear experiments (which<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m interested as scientist), but I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt; interested in the artistic result (as musician,<br/>&gt;&gt; music lover).</p><p>&gt; JR: Like you, I don&apos;t want to hear experiments.  For<br/>&gt; example, I have always resisted the fast comparison of<br/>&gt; the same piece being performed in competing<br/>&gt; tunings.  However, there is science is the music<br/>&gt; of Bach, as well.</p><p>&gt; For example, an analysis of the Brandenburg Concerti opening<br/>&gt; melodic intervals reveals that Bach used four semitones as<br/>&gt; an opening interval in four different Concerti.  In each<br/>&gt; instance, the specific interval used is a semitone of 108<br/>&gt; cents,</p><p>This is fiction:<br/>How would Bach or someone else guarantee an performance to the<br/>maximum deviation of 0.1 cent (which your use of the figure 108<br/>indicates. I guess you follow the scientific standard in giving<br/>figures and the degree of  preciseness indicated by them).<br/>A free intonating instrument will not be able to carry out a<br/>controlled out-of-tuneness that exactly. Not to speak of the<br/>collective imprecision of several free intonating players.</p><p>Some simple physics might help understanding the practical<br/>implications.<br/>In wind-instruments, the problem of &quot;warming up&quot; the instrument<br/>will produce considerable deviations larger than 1 cent (per 1&deg;<br/>Celsius  temperature difference will be 3.0 cents). When the<br/>player stops playing for a few minutes to pause, the temperature<br/>will probably have dropped. Whatever he did in the meantime to<br/>keep the instrument at exactly the pitch required bby the<br/>exactictude from which your description starts, it will fail,<br/>due to the &quot;chaotic&quot; behaviour of the many circumstances which<br/>are not all precisely controlled by the enesmble-leader nor the<br/>player himself (room-temperature, breath temperature,<br/>playing-wind pressure etc.)</p><p>Temperature will be important not only in wind instruments, but<br/>also other instruments. When the room gets warm, the strings<br/>fall in pitch (contary to the would winds!). More chaos to come.</p><p>Temperature brings us back from the very different question of<br/>ensemble intonation, which was seen completely different by the<br/>17th and 18th century authors: Bach&apos;s famous and very<br/>experienced colleague Telemann stated for example that you<br/>&quot;daily&quot; hear singers and woodwinds playing pure)</p><p>Similar or the same  physical effects will appear in an<br/>accompanying organ (not used in the Brandenburg concerti but our<br/>point of departure), whether it is tuned to Werckmeister XY or<br/>any other temperament or tuning: there will be a rise or fall of<br/>3.0 Cent per degree Celsius. This is a result of the function of<br/>speed of sound in air.<br/>Btw I expected, that humidity changes could play a role,<br/>too, but a research on that - done by a colleague in acoustics<br/>department, showed that humidity plays a neglectible role to<br/>the pitch, it is way beyond 0.1 cent difference.<br/>And if you think to performance with an organ (positive organ,<br/>or in a smaller church or other room): at what temperature was<br/>the organ tuned and how much different is the temperature in the<br/>given moment, that the music is performed? In an unheated church<br/>the temperature range easily will cover a range of 16 &deg;C from<br/>4&deg; C to 20&deg; C over the year (small churches might warm up even<br/>more in the Summer).<br/>This results in a difference of 48 cents. When the profesional<br/>tuner started - I have documented examples for that (evidence!)<br/>- it might have taken 6-9 or even mor moths in a large organ, to<br/>tune it (these lenghts are from tuning activities in North<br/>German church record between the end of the 16th century to the<br/>end of the 18th century - in th 17th century for example a total<br/>retuning away from meantone is nowhere indicated (all evidence<br/>points without exception to the contrary).<br/>An additional unwelcome effect is that the pipework doesn&apos;t<br/>react linear to warming or cooling. This depends also on the<br/>heat conductance of the pipe wall material (tin, lead, tin-lead<br/>alloys, wood of different density and isolating properties), the<br/>different coefficients for thermal expansion which might affect<br/>the sounding length of the pipe. And (not only) in a church the<br/>question of the warmth of from where the wind comes into the<br/>organ (extra bellowsroom or from the church inner) plays a role<br/>for the overall stability.  Think also about front pipes which<br/>will earlier be affected by the room temperature, than the inner<br/>pipe work - at the same time the form a huge block of material,<br/>slowing downm the room temperature change from the pipework<br/>behind them.  Also the different sizes of pipes will make huge<br/>differences in adjusting to the temperature: small pipes will<br/>change the temperature again much faster than the large pipes.<br/>Therefore the mixtures are a main head ache.<br/>Oh, I nearlly forgot that the divisions of large organs might be<br/>distributed over a total height of an organ up to 20 m.  The<br/>molecular movement by warming up any matter in gaseous state<br/>(like air) leads to that the gas needs more space (air pressure<br/>remaining more or less constant) need more space: it will expand<br/>in volume, and become less dense. Consequence  is not only the<br/>already mentioned change of speed of sound in the warmed up air<br/>(causing rise of pitch), but also that the heated &quot;bubble&quot; will<br/>get a buyoant force (Auftrieb) - In simple words: heated air<br/>goes up, collects under the vaults, and soon your Oberwerk will<br/>get out of tune, or at best rise (all pipes of the Oberwerk<br/>together by 3.0 cents/degree Celsius temperature<br/>difference.<br/>Other problems will be the &quot;flexible wind&quot; supply, however the<br/>pressure wave damped by a system of interrelated bellows may be.</p><p>So, suppose that someone actually started with the intention of<br/>tuning a Werckmeister XY-temperament, or another well-tempered<br/>or ET. If it actually was there at a moment, then it is likely<br/>that next day or in one month your Werckmeister becomes a<br/>&quot;J&auml;germeister&quot; (a German bitters, or liqueur)</p><p>How about meantone temperament. Yes, it is also affected by the<br/>same physics and circumstances. But similar to an ensemble,<br/>performing in the way it is described in treatises throughout<br/>the time aruond 1700, the many close to pure intervals of<br/>meantone temperament, if technically proper tuned (which is<br/>difficult, too), can be suspected to have withstood, somewhat<br/>better.<br/>However, tuning an organ was an exhausting procedure - and it<br/>was, as as a famous young colleague of Buxtehude wrote, the<br/> &quot;most important&quot; to check in the organ examination (which<br/>itself could take days and days!).</p><p> &gt; the largest of four different sizes of semitone in<br/> &gt; Werckmeister III.</p><p>Neither the different semitones, nor other (unsuccessful)<br/>&quot;controlled&quot; deviations  in other of his or other author&apos;s<br/>suggestions (includung ET)  were regarded worth one single word<br/>in the treatises (to name a few relevant: Quantz, Agricola<br/>(Tosi), Mattheson, Telemann).  And it is interesting to watch,<br/>that the treatises more and more take up the issue of playing as<br/>pure as possible during the 18th century, when - as Mattheson<br/>puts it - ET was the preferred temperament, but he confirms at<br/>the same time that singers and free intonating musicians are not<br/>able too perform the semitones and the other out of tune<br/>intervals. He says it would take at least one generation to<br/>educate them in such a way, and that a positive result of such<br/>education is not guaranteed or can be foreseen.<br/>If they couldn&apos;t perform constant and exact semitones of 100<br/>cent, how could they have performed other semitones, required<br/>for keyboards? Mattheson for example states in this<br/>context, that the keyboards do not include the organ: he points<br/>especially to Werckmeister&apos;s temperaments and ET, saying that<br/>they are not to be found in organs - from time to time however<br/>in harpsichords!)</p><p>In the middle of the 18th century for that reason the organ<br/>began to lose its function as an accompaniment instrument (also<br/>stated by Mattheson and others) - because of the (most often<br/>still prevailing) old temperament (i. e. meantone), causing more<br/>and more problems in the accompaniment practice!<br/>Then, another point is, that retunings to Equal temperament would not have been necessary if the Werckmeister-XY-<br/>temperaments would have been regarded as important  as you make<br/>him (contrary to Werckmeister&apos;s own statement, now often<br/>reffered to)</p><p> &gt; It makes musical sense to use only the<br/> &gt; largest semitone  for the opening melodic motive.  This is<br/> &gt; too much for chance.</p><p>For the believer, yes - But not for those who have consulted the<br/>sources, and consider the frame given by musiacl acoustic, and<br/>instrument acoustics.</p><p> &gt; There are 39 distinct melodic intervals in Werckmeister<br/> &gt; III and this is clearly more important to the musician<br/> &gt; than to the musicologist.</p><p>Today, may be, but to the contrary for the contemporary<br/>free-intonating musician, who was required to sing or play as<br/>pure as possible (above the continuo).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: But from that small and vague performance basis a<br/>&gt;&gt; valid judgment or an evaluation of a previous historical<br/>&gt;&gt; situation cannot be drawn. Not even for temperaments.</p><p>&gt; JR: This is just your opinion.</p><p>Of course: If I would write here 2+2 = 4 or that there is this<br/>and that evidence for that the Earth is moving &quot;round&quot; the Sun,<br/>you might say on the same basis of your scientific philosophy,<br/>that such statements are opinion.</p><p> &gt;  Live performance further informs.</p><p>I agree: it informs about exactly the performance condition of<br/>that very moment of today.</p><p> &gt;  It is part of the process, a necessary part, in my opinion.</p><p>Of the process of playing, yes, and the process of buildig up<br/>one&apos;s own (modern) aesthetics - must not be, but can contradict<br/>the historical practice completely</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Personal preferences for example for a certain<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament are by definition no evidence - except<br/>&gt;&gt; for the individual, who brings it forward.</p><p>&gt; JR: The above is meaningless in regard to my situation.</p><p>Yes, but if you would start to use the &quot;tools&quot; used to find,<br/>verify or falsify historical information, it could become<br/>meaningful at some point.</p><p>&gt;  You cannot be blamed for not knowing what my involvement<br/>&gt; in music has been.</p><p>Yes I can&apos;t, and I acknowledge of course that you certainly are<br/>much more into performance with modern instruments than into<br/>historical research. No one can do everything the same good, and<br/> I do only my work as music historian with some dilettantic<br/>musicianship besides (&quot;Dilettant&quot; was in Beethoven&apos;s and<br/>Schubert&apos;s Vienna someone who didn&apos;t live from professional<br/>musik making, but has anyway a musical education, which he could<br/>use to leive on it)</p><p>&gt;  Ibo: I think it is necessary to &quot;defend&quot; HIP &quot;against its<br/>&gt; devotees&quot; - by collecting and constantly widening<br/>&gt; knowledge. We don&apos;t need believers in the field who don&apos;t<br/>&gt; want to see evidence contradicting them, but we need<br/>&gt; knowledgeable people who [challenge? JR].</p><p>&gt; JR: I above wholeheartedly with the above statement.</p><p>Great, when do you start to sceptically scrutinize your beliefs,<br/>which a scientist must do always?  It is that elmentary<br/>scientific scepticism which scientist have to learn. To this<br/>belongs that selective reading of source parts, without taking<br/>their context into consideration is &quot;dangereous&quot; - when talking<br/>about organs, it is for example, not taking in the available<br/>info on their contemporary status.<br/>After years this scepticism brought me away from the simplistic<br/>belief that well-temperaments were suddenly en vogue in organs,<br/>only because such temperaments were published by gifted<br/>propagandists, who for whatever reason (finances, support by a<br/>convinced duke etc.) had the possiblity to publish).<br/>Scientific scepticism  lead me also away from believing that ET<br/>is not a choice for the early eighteenth century - something<br/>which I have had a hard time with, because I don&apos;t &quot;like&quot; my<br/>result. But my preference is contradicted by important evidence<br/>from the time - so I have to put aside my aesthetic prejudice<br/>against ET. And for ensemble performance ET can work fine in the<br/>accompanying keyboard instrument(s), as any other circulating<br/>temperament.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Temperament is one field of building historical<br/>&gt;&gt; myths, others are also fields of mixing individual<br/>&gt;&gt; (historical and modern) preferences to find explanatory<br/>&gt;&gt; systems, which please us so much nowadays: &quot;key<br/>&gt;&gt; characteristics&quot;, &quot;rhetorics&quot; and &quot;affects&quot; - and<br/>&gt;&gt; tempi.</p><p>&gt; JR: Sorry to contradict, but history is already practically<br/>&gt; all-myth regarding temperament.  &quot;Bach invented equal<br/>&gt; temperament&quot; is widely believed throughout history, and it<br/>&gt; is a myth.</p><p>What is contradicting? Here we partly agree, inasmuch this<br/>simple-minded Bach-ET myth is obviously again and again<br/>transported and will be so in eternity, amen!<br/>We can only bring the historical facts to the fore. But those,<br/>on the other hand do not allow us to conclude, neither that Bach<br/>used only one temperament over his nearly 50 years of<br/>professional musicianship, nor which temperament it was at a<br/>given moment. All sources, relate vaguely to this matter only,<br/>and are from later time and used as material in the<br/>&quot;Temperaturenstreit&quot; in which not even Bach&apos;s former students<br/>agreed on anything.<br/>Cautiously one could argue that Bach<br/>- might have used some form of  circulating temperament in his<br/>   stringed keyboard instruments, may be for some works a<br/>   meantone or modified meantone temp.,  for others some form<br/>   of a well-temperament, for others may up  to &quot;hand made&quot; ET<br/>- applied the common rule for free intonating instruments<br/>   in ensemble music, and<br/>- in organs simply had to take what he got when he came to<br/>  a place (like Hamburg, where he applied, liked the organs,<br/>  which were all meantone long after his visit!)</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; while making one of my travels. His wife Vertrude<br/>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Is really &apos;Vertrude&apos; her name?<br/>&gt; JR: Technically, it MUST be Gertrude, but he always said<br/>&gt; it like it was with a &quot;V&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; JR: Wasn&apos;t it his pride to write things up because his<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;temperament was chosen? Why else?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Yes of course, because as he himself stated in<br/>&gt;&gt; print 1697, that the organ builders are so stubborn<br/>&gt;&gt; and don&apos;t follow his new temperament suggestions. Which<br/>&gt;&gt; he by the way constantly changed, added, admitted<br/>&gt;&gt; change, corrections tec. from book to book which<br/>&gt;&gt; he published.</p><p>&gt; JR: Perhaps, they were not following his suggestions<br/>&gt; enough?</p><p>How could he control or know that if he didn&apos;t travel everywhere?<br/>How could he expect an exact taking-over, while being he,<br/>as a very practical and brilliant organ expert (with a slight<br/>tic for temperaments - biased like all, but more practicalk than<br/>his contemporary or modern &quot;figure-knights&quot;)  knew what<br/>extraordinary effort it was to tune/retune an organ?</p><p>&gt; While the fact that he kept changing through corrections</p><p>In all Werckmeister I don&apos;t see that he corrects one single of<br/>his previous temperament suggestions, saying &quot;this was not good<br/>enough, take better this instead from now on&quot;</p><p>&gt; and additions underscores the fact that W. always referred<br/>&gt; his readers back to Musicalische Temperatur of 1691 for<br/>&gt; further temperament detail.</p><p>and for general detail, but it was not a prescription of how to<br/>do it.<br/>And why did he explain the 1/3-p.comma-temperament in words,<br/>while just give an unxplained table for W III?<br/>And, why did Bendeler, his colleague (and in that case really a<br/>friend and cooperating together in Quedlinburg) publish himself<br/>in the 1690s  three temperament suggestions? B., a real<br/>practitioner, claimed that they didn&apos;t not deviate in<br/>practice from what he describes on paper - he was an experienced<br/>organist, organ consultant and probably even an organ builder.<br/>These are two temperaments with 1/3rd-p.comma-fifths, one with 1/4 p.caomma-fifths. Like Werckmeister he describes mainly how<br/>to deal with the 1/3rd-comma- temps. Bendeler&apos;s organ building<br/>treatise got a second edition in the 1730s (!) and was copied<br/>even later in the 18th, for example by hand of a Swiss organ<br/>builder.</p><p>Please explain, why exactly Bendeler&apos;s well-tempered suggestions<br/>as well as Werckmeister&apos;s 1/3rd-comma-temp. are not belonging to<br/>what you think acceptable, better etc.?  What is the factual<br/>basis for your, now often repeated, until now unsupported<br/>statements?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;JR: The above is true in Holland, yes: but not Thuringia.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: What are your statistics for Thuringia. You just<br/>&gt;&gt; correctly stated that the area is crowded with churches<br/>&gt;&gt; in many smaller and greater places. Of how many exactly<br/>&gt;&gt; do you have any evidence about the status of the organ<br/>&gt;&gt; in Bach&apos;s lifetime 1685-1750?</p><p>&gt; JR: My understanding is that organs cannot retain their<br/>&gt; tuning for over 300 years.</p><p>That&apos;s nothing news and organs were frequently maintained.<br/>Tuning touch-ups were done in some cases every 3-4 year -<br/>without temperament change (intended).<br/>To get to know things like this  it is necessary to look into<br/>archival evidence like examination reports. So, what exactly is<br/>your evidence from archives (also from later published archival<br/>research), if not reports on the actual status of the organ at a<br/>given moment?</p><p>&gt; Further, many records regarding church organs have<br/>&gt; been destroyed as a result of war.</p><p>Many have been destroyed in wars or in previous town burning.<br/>Historical matter has the &quot;natural&quot; tendency to disappear with<br/>time - it happens right know on two criminal sides which acting<br/>in war against each other.</p><p>However, much has survived to let us see even detailed shapes of<br/>the mosaiques and most of the colours.<br/>And thorough archival research will deliver much more in<br/>future. Too many amateurs, especially in the organ field have<br/>done archival work too selectively, often not regarding the<br/>development of the archive and its collections, not seeing in<br/>which contexts other indications can be found.<br/>Especially in Eastern Germany you can find lots in church<br/>archives, which no one ever has taken effort to look through. In<br/>May 2001  I was travelling through some town and church archives<br/>in that area.<br/>In one case I had within one morning a whole library in my hand,<br/>in the attic (thin, partly broken windows, no heating or<br/>artificial climate!) with hand written and printed 16th and 17th<br/>books, scores (incl. Praetorius, Hammerschmidt) and other<br/>material - stapled in meter-high bulks! Incredible and sad at<br/>tha same time. In the whole &quot;mess&quot; I found a whole organ file<br/>about an important 1650-instrument of one of the best builders<br/>of te time. It showed that the organ basically existed only<br/>slihtly altered until 1928/29. I hope to be able to find a photo<br/>soon - as I found a early 19th-century architectural(!) drawing<br/>of the instrument, too!</p><p> A lot has been done on the other hand, which was fortunately<br/>published before the war(s), so there is plenty too dig in - and<br/>we need a lot of highly skilled archival researchers,<br/>Especially to clean up with many myths and the preferences which<br/>have partly developped from not taking this evidence serious,<br/>but mainly from not knowing such evidence.</p><p>&gt; As the nomenclature for discussing tuning is so flexible,<br/>&gt; and has been poorly translated previously</p><p>That&apos;s exact the reason why any researcher in the history of<br/>this field has to have a profound knowledge of the used historic<br/>language. No one studying the Romans can do without proper<br/>knowledge of classical Latin, for example. ( A musicologist<br/>dealing with music and sources before 1800 also should have some<br/>working knowledge of Latin, probably some of Italian and Spanish<br/>as well. German, English, Dutch and one of the three<br/>indoeuropean scandinavian languages for the Northern European<br/>parts, too.)<br/>If I would go to study Purcell and his music, I would have to<br/>deeply dig into the English Language of his time, and how it is<br/>different from today.<br/>If I see for example that one of the key publications of the<br/>early 17th century, was translated to English, is available to<br/>music students, I can only welcome it. But the translator did a<br/>bad job because in basically every second paragraph I find major<br/>faults already in his understanding the language (In this<br/>respect one publication deserves praise, it the Schlick-<br/>translation by Elizabeth Berry Barber). Without knowing the<br/>original language, and sometimes exchanging opinion with other<br/>experts on it, the reading of such sources is useless, at best -<br/>but more often dangering scientific work.<br/>Recently in a musicology seminar a translated quote from a<br/>German text of 1802 was read and discussed at great length. This<br/>text spoke about the &quot;subtle&quot; - and  big discussion about &quot;das<br/>Subtile&quot; started.  My remark, that the translation probably was<br/>wrong, because ... was not taken into account, who cares about a<br/>source? In the evening of the same day I got a fotocopy of the<br/>original text, since a friend offered to look it up on my<br/>protest.  As I had suspected, the original was not using the<br/>word &quot;subtle&quot; at all  and the whole original text didn&apos;t touch<br/>the topic by far.</p><p>&gt; to both scholars and musicians, a  new look on tuning<br/>&gt; practice for the late Baroque is warranted.</p><p>yes, always: for the organ from sources and evidence, which<br/>until now is neglected: status reports etc.<br/>And a new look must shed new light on it, not burring it by<br/>personal preference</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; Before he was to publish in Quedlinburg he<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; travelled&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&Acirc;&brvbar;.even to Amsterdam.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: No,<br/>&gt;&gt; at least if you didn&apos;t find evidence for that in some<br/>&gt;&gt; archive - that would be really exciting!</p><p>&gt; JR: I noticed that Werckmeister used Dutch terms in some of<br/>&gt; his writing.<br/>&gt; Particularly, I recall the Dutch word for the comma.</p><p>I have grown up with German, Low German, and partly with Dutch -<br/>all three closely related. I read Dutch, talk a bit, my Dutch<br/>friends talk often in Dutch too me, as my relatives in Low<br/>German. I also have studied a lot of older Dutch (my<br/>Alkmaar-Article shows evidence for that).<br/>However, I have not sen any particular use of words pointing to<br/>Ducth, may be at times, to local (Harz-region) variant of<br/>Low-German or Eastfalian German dialect.</p><p>From your excellence in Dutch language, tell us please, which<br/>word you are referring to, as the Dutch word is &quot;Komma&quot; (or also<br/>&quot;comma&quot;).</p><p> &gt; (Frau Lichtwitz translated trough different Werckmeister<br/> &gt; books.)</p><p>I will not doubt her excellence, but it is a frequent mistake<br/>from Germans of other German regions to think, that Low German<br/>and Dutch are more or less the same, because they don&apos;t<br/>understand either of them (I don&apos;t refer to the German-Low<br/>German mix, which originated in some North German areas with an<br/>earlier and higher fluctuation of population).</p><p>Did you check, that she has a very thorough working knowledge in<br/>all these three related, but different languages?<br/>Anyway, better not rely on people only because the are nice<br/>people (of which fortunately many are around) - for example to<br/>solve my question on influence of humidity on pitch, I asked an<br/>building engineer, who is at the same  acoustician, with<br/>profound knowledge on materials, too. I could have asked an<br/>organ buidler or musician friend with some &quot;popular science&quot;<br/>knowledge, sure - but how could I trust the info, so I anyway<br/>have to double-check with someone else, if I can&apos;t myself<br/>understand the underlying principles. It&apos;s hard work to come to<br/>small pieces of info, but the reliable part of the mosaiques<br/>grow, and now, after many years of research, they grow faster<br/>and faster (which needs even more double-checking)</p><p>&gt; The Dutch trip is now relegated to a hunch. It would make<br/>&gt; sense for a young Werckmeister to check out the environs<br/>&gt; of Sweelink.</p><p>Yes and you could make up a lot more of &quot;could be-s&quot;:<br/>Werckmeister then probably traveled to Rome to visit the grave<br/>of Palestrina and on the way in Munich  di Lasso&apos;s heritage -<br/>both were reference composers until far to the end of the 17th<br/>ct.. Not to speak of course about the famous Zarlino&apos;s relics in<br/>Venice, finally he was one of the constantly referred to tuning<br/>and temperament theoreticians.<br/>And from that card house we could &quot;scientifically&quot; conclude also<br/>that he spoke Italian and Latin (for the papal administration)</p><p>From Zarlino Sweelinck is said to have taken lots of<br/>theoretical background - a previous, suspected journey of<br/>Sweelinck to Zarlino however is today regared as having a very<br/>small likelines!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &Atilde;&tilde; He was a Johnny<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Appleseed of tuning ideas he had called a natural<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; consequence of Praetorian quarter-comma meantone.

He couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; claim that, since it was in use before Praetorius 1619,<br/>&gt;&gt; and before Zarlino&apos;s description in 1571 and before<br/>&gt;&gt; Pietro A(a)ron and before Ramis de Parejas practical<br/>&gt;&gt; description in 1482.</p><p>[to Wallyesterrufus:  This info I have from several of reference<br/>  works, not at least Lindley&apos;s works, also Franz Josef Ratte&apos;s<br/>  highly valuable source reading book]</p><p>&gt; JR: This is what concerns me: the idea is a circular<br/>&gt; well-temperament.<br/>&gt; Why do you characterize Werckmeister about making pompous<br/>&gt; claims?</p><p>Which claims, do you mean by &quot;pompous&quot;?</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister calls meantone-temperament &quot;Praetorian tuning&quot;<br/>&gt; with all possible respect to Praetorious.</p><p>Who?</p><p>&gt;  Though this was listed &quot;second&quot; as Werckmeister II,<br/>&gt; it is just a category of common tuning&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;though of an earlier<br/>&gt; tradition (or generation).</p><p>Werckmeister calls meantone temperament in his time the common<br/>temperament (&quot;die allgemeine Temperatur&quot;) as a opposed to his<br/>own inventions.

J</p><p>Here I agree!</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The organ builder Wender of Muhlhausen preferred to use<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.</p><p>[you ommited something here]</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: No, bad methods occur in any science - actually<br/>&gt;&gt; often they can&apos;t be considered to be science, but novel<br/>&gt;&gt; writing.</p><p>&gt; JR: I guess the question, then, is why did Bach-archiv<br/>&gt; publish such bad musicology, then?</p><p>Good idea, why don&apos;t you ask them?<br/>I don&apos;t think (like you) that it is &quot;such bad&quot;. It provides some<br/>different source evidence - which however is not connected to<br/>each other sufficiently to make the author&apos;s case. So that<br/>article has also a very good and careful part in bringing us new<br/>archival material (partly quoting from other publications, too)<br/>and thus increasing the chance this material to survive if the<br/>originals will be lost at some time in the future.<br/>And I have adressed my concern to the author -as I wrote before.<br/>What he does with my info is his &quot;beer&quot; - it is not my task to<br/>hinder anyone from feasable reasoning nor keeping to unproven<br/>card houses (which might stabilize, if only evidence would shown<br/>for statements). If it concerns my research, i might or will<br/>speak up, however.</p><p>&gt;&gt;There was no one before Werckmeister to present a tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;that would do what was musically necessary.</p><p>What you regard as &quot;musically&quot;, &quot;necessary&quot; or/and<br/>&quot;musically/necessary&quot;  can be different for any person, then and<br/>now. It doesn&apos;t contribute slightly to the case:<br/>We are talking still, about what was the actual status of<br/>temperament in the organs in Werckmeister&apos;s time and still I<br/>have not heard of any example additional to those one or two (of<br/>which the exact temperament has been assumed only!) which<br/>Werckmeister mentions.</p><p>As musical performance is much about aesthetics you can&apos;t claim<br/>a &quot;truth&quot; from modern performance (in fact not even from a<br/>performance in Werckmeister&apos;s time).</p><p>&gt;&gt;  Ibo: Take the differenciating view of the Bremen Dom<br/>&gt;&gt; (cathedral) organist Grave who advocated 1755 for keeping<br/>&gt;&gt; the meantone temperament in the (Schnitger)-organ,<br/>&gt;&gt; because it is better for the liturgical function the<br/>&gt;&gt; organ, though he says that he would prefer ET for<br/>&gt;&gt; accompanying the ensemble music (a pattern of<br/>&gt;&gt; argument, which we find in Mattheson&apos;s and other writer&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; publications already around 1730). However he states,<br/>&gt;&gt; that the ensemble music is not as important issue in<br/>&gt;&gt; his church, so the &quot;Praetorian&quot; temperament should be kept.<br/>&gt;&gt; The organ was retuned 20 years later - direct to ET!<br/>&gt;&gt; (A bunch of similar cases and arguments are known to me).</p><p>&gt; JR: This is an interesting example.  As a performer, it<br/>&gt; is at the opposite end of what music means.  Grave<br/>&gt; would not use the organ with instrumentalists.</p><p>Yes, he would, too - but not as excessive as it was done in<br/>Lutheran churches. The cathedral in Bremen had always<br/>instrumental music - but the large organs purpose was not mainly<br/>to play *always* with them. You&apos;ll find that and much more in<br/>the valuable dissertation by Oliver Rosteck: &quot;Bremische<br/>Musikgeschichte von der Reformation bis zur Mitte des 18.<br/>Jahrhunderts&quot;, Lilienthal/Bremen: Eres, 1999. He covers actually<br/>more than the title already suggests. It is a large, well<br/>founded study, relying very much on his thorough archival<br/>studies (but according to New Musicology that&apos;s of course<br/>inferior. Being inferior in this respect myself, I stick to my<br/>other inferior colleagues as Rosteck, who still keep to the<br/>old-fashioned scientific methods. Fortunately we dinosaurs<br/>still are many - and probably like dinosaurs on the long run<br/>we&apos;ll have been the most long existing and successful<br/>species).</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s a good, specific example.<br/>You bet!</p><p>&gt;  It may be the exception</p><p>On the contrary - if you would study the organ history,<br/>especially, but not only of the large town organs,  you&apos;ll find<br/>a similar pattern in the arguments of organists in the 18th century</p><p>&gt; that proves the rule: that organs more often<br/>&gt; DO play with instrumentalists.</p><p>yes - and exactly to that purpose meantone was so much<br/>preferred, because it stabilizes the ensemble intonation of the<br/>free intonating instruments! At the same time it was most<br/>beneficial in congregational singing (for a long time not<br/>accompanied, but even more benficial for that!) and for the<br/>abundant practice of transposing pieces, one of the most<br/>important tasks professional organists had to be able to perform<br/>- to the &quot;weirdest&quot; intervals and from scratch - it was one of<br/>the best tested ability during organist auditions (even more<br/>interesting is ..., but that I&apos;ll tell you later)!<br/>Also it was more stable as organ tuning than its (later) WT or<br/>ET concurrents.  Somewhat exact tuned ET (as much as the<br/>technique and physics allowed) also formed a excellent basis for<br/>the above described ensemble practice, since the deviations to<br/>be heard were constant, and not evven worse chords of WTs like<br/>F#-major would disturb even more in pieces which made use of<br/>such harmonies.</p><p>Since well-temperaments or ET didn&apos;t differ in this respect very<br/>much,  ET was taking over especially from mid-18th century</p><p>&gt; And that this is an important function.<br/>Again agreed</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: How would we &quot;characterize&quot; Mr. Grave:<br/>&gt;&gt; - &quot;conservative&quot; because he let&apos;s the meantone temperament<br/>&gt;&gt;    stay in the organ, since it serves well the required<br/>&gt;&gt; or recognized function (in the liturgy)<br/>&gt;&gt; - &quot;progressive&quot; as he propses equal temperament for ensemble<br/>&gt;&gt;    music accompaniment<br/>&gt;&gt; - &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;opportunistic&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; as he judges in<br/>&gt;&gt;    general from the function of the organ</p><p>&gt; JR: I would say conservative,</p><p>&gt; non-progressive (because he likely never<br/>&gt; heard exact equal temperament&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;s. Jorgensen),</p><p>This is again a value-judgement not backed by enough historical<br/>knowledge.  Who today hears &quot;exact&quot; ET in this respect,<br/>except when ET has been tuned with the help of electronic<br/>instruments, And how long does it stay as exact in mechanical<br/>instruments? Which organ stays today in 99,99% exact ET. There<br/>are lots of myths and belifes around the modern practice, too.<br/>The aristid&euml;ic calculations of monochord lengths and also the<br/>very exact* methods referred to by Kirnberger (I seem to<br/>remember, that he got his wisdom from a French, Lambert)<br/>(*exact: within the frame of hand tuned possibilities, even if a<br/>electronic tuning device will be used, for example for tuning a<br/>harpscihord, the method related by Kirnberger will produce a<br/>result of the same - or even - better preciseness!

But practical<br/>considerations aside  (as &quot;How long does the harpsichord stay in<br/>tune?&quot;  - &quot;As soon as someone opens the door!&quot;) - we don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt; This is slipshod, and unnecessary</p><p>I&apos;m sorry for that: I think by now I have often pointed to<br/>thorough research and requirements of that, so you should from<br/>now on avoid being slipshod - and certainly with much better<br/>support, than I ever could deliver to you.<br/>Start directly with getting away from the following of your<br/>preconceived ideas:</p><p> &gt; As a composer, I believe a composer has a more precise<br/> &gt; image in the mind than many a player can render under<br/> &gt; the best of circumstances.</p><p>This is only an idealistic view in the spirit of 19th and 20th<br/>century heroic biography tradition - it doesn&apos;t help your<br/>scientific excellence.<br/>Composers like Bach and Buxtehude were in many respects highly<br/>practical people. If the oboe would play 1 or 2 cent above or<br/>below the pure third required this would be perfectly in the<br/>frame of then-accepted ensemble intonation.</p><p>&gt; I think it is important that the tuning basis of a composer<br/>&gt; be honored.</p><p>Yes, as soon as you might find evidence for Buxtehude or Bach or<br/>whomever from that time, I&apos;m eager to get to know it including<br/>the exact basis, the &quot;calculation of your possible error&quot;<br/>(determining one&apos;s and one&apos;s matrials limits is a very useful<br/>habit from natural science).</p><p>&gt; Hence, the drive to determine tunings for each composer.</p><p>Better get away from the drive, again: &quot;Sine ira et studio!&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Plus, the voicing, registration and the room can<br/>&gt;&gt; do incredible much to lead astray even experiencesd<br/>&gt;&gt; people.  So what could we gain from our today&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; listening experience - where we already do not agree.<br/>&gt;&gt; How would you know that Buxtehude or Werckmeister<br/>&gt;&gt; would agree to your personal preference,<br/>&gt;&gt; and not to mine?</p><p>&gt; JR:  I could convince you if you made a visit to my<br/>&gt; apartment in New York.</p><p>Thanks for the invitation - you are as much welcome here, too.<br/>But I have no special plans to visit the US in the near future</p><p>&gt; I would play examples and help you recognize the<br/>&gt; appropriateness of Werckmeister&apos;s tuning to Buxtehude<br/>&gt; and how ET fails the composer utterly in comparison.</p><p>So I will have to wait until times might get better. I regret<br/>this, since after 20 years of professional tuning practice, I<br/>really feel the desperate need to learn about appropriatness of<br/>Werckmeister III - from your evidence (until now not presented).</p><p>&gt;&gt;It is important to point out that every single book<br/>&gt;&gt;Werckmeister published through 1707</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: He died in 1706</p><p>and of course I know very well that the &quot;Paradoxal=Discourse&quot;<br/>appeared posthumously</p><p>&gt; JR: Yes, but his last book was published posthumously<br/>&gt; by his children in order to gain some much needed income.</p><p>The reason of my remark was exactly to provoce that you give<br/>some exact background information, for once.

In the same way we<br/>cannot conlude backwards from our individual performing backgrounds.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;  He never failed to favor purer intervals in diatonic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;keys.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: Yes as he says about ET that he thinks is a good<br/>&gt;&gt; choice, too! But he admits that he himself would like<br/>&gt;&gt; to keep some thirds slightly better.</p><p>&gt; JR: You don&apos;t see the good politics here?</p><p>Lateley I have become somewhat fed up with politics.<br/>Werckmeister, however, accepted in his writings everything but<br/>meantone. He expressed his preference to somewhat better<br/>diatonic notes and left it to the good (or bad) judgement of his<br/>readers and those who could tune an instrument.<br/>So what?</p><p>&gt;  More significant, he continued to endorse his own ideas.</p><p>Agreed, whatever all his (sometimes) diverging &quot;ideas&quot; were.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Incidentally, I just conducted &quot;Where is the newborn<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;king of the Jews&quot; in Werckmeister III.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: The temperament of the continuo doesn&apos;t play a larger<br/>&gt;&gt; role:<br/>&gt;&gt; See my contribution on the harpsichord list<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;temperament - ensemble intonation&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/><a href="http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0301&L=hpschd-l&P=R3618">http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0301&L=hpschd-l&P=R3618</a></p><p>&gt; JR: I couldn&apos;t disagree more.</p><p>It is by definition not possible to compare a negation.<br/>&quot;Disagree&quot; means that you do not share an opinion.

Ok,<br/>but here you deny strongly scientific reason, simple maths and<br/>evidence. Again, do not let your preference steer your perception.</p><p>&gt; But of course, I understand your misunderstanding.<br/>&gt; (Look, I&apos;m sorry to appear arrogant.</p><p>No, no,  not at all, just lack of facts, until now unpresented<br/>evidence etc.</p><p>&gt; But I hope you realize as I do that we are really only<br/>&gt; poking a bit of fun at each other in a polemical manner.)</p><p>My way of writing might be funny at times, but arguments are dry<br/>and exact.</p><p>&gt; I read your letters and generally enjoyed them.  To the<br/>&gt; matters we have been addressing, I must disagree with<br/>&gt; this one:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo (from Harpsichord List) &quot;WTs force the singer/player to<br/>&gt;&gt; a much more difficult to control intonation, especially in<br/>&gt;&gt; the remote keys (where WTs are worse than ET).&quot;</p><p>Here I must say, that I could *not*  *not* disagree more with<br/>myself. I wonder how I got such a normal and factual correct<br/>sentence out of this stupid keyboard.</p><p>&gt; JR: What is more accurate is that Werckmeister III is a<br/>&gt; case of controlled expression.</p><p>I&apos;m very eager to learn from you, what it might &quot;express&quot;. The<br/>pythagorean thirds in A-flat-major for example might reflect<br/>some composers bellyache.  And the somewhat pure C-major chord<br/>expresses may this ..., that.. or may be that ...<br/>A 50.000 musically educated other people will come up with<br/>50.001 diffrent opinions on that.  Bla bla...</p><p>&gt; Where a modern musician might use an elastic intonation,</p><p>I here this all the time, just have to switch on any radio<br/>programme: this kind of modern &quot;eeelaaastic intonation&quot;<br/>stretches my ears . Then the vibrato comes and covers with mercy<br/>the de-tonation of 99,9999 % of the &quot;trained&quot; musicians - (being<br/>highly trained not to listen exactly).</p><p>&gt; Werckmeister III require head on intonation (in other<br/>&gt; words, no sliding below or above notes).  The<br/>&gt; harpsichord becomes gold.</p><p>Which type of harpsichord exactly? In Germany there were around<br/>Flemish types (may be with french ravalement), Italian types,<br/>and of course the german &quot;schools&quot;. Each one reacting quite<br/>different to temperament and tuning.<br/>And what do you think of the quite natural effect of string<br/>torsion? Happens every now and then - and forces the experienced<br/>tuner to deviate more or less from a concept he might have<br/>intended (don&apos;t tell me, that Buxtehude or Bach restrung some<br/>strings just a few minutes before a public performance just for<br/>that). Anyway your W III is mainly a fiction in many cases, it<br/>is an approximation (in the keyboard instrument)</p><p>Btw. there are many places where you can read, that instruments<br/>got tuned according to the key of the piece. Do you &quot;transpose&quot;<br/>Werckmeister?</p><p>&gt; Every string players huddles<br/>That huddling we hear plenty everywhere on recordings, concerts,<br/>what you want</p><p>&gt; by it to get the exact intonation throughout the concert.</p><p>Do you mean seriously you have heard &quot;exact&quot; (how exact, did you<br/>measure?) intonation from free intonating instruments? And you<br/>do not mean anyway the as pure as possible intonation as<br/>described and requireed in the 17th and 18th century?</p><p>&gt; When everyone know ET, it doesn&apos;t matter much whether you<br/>&gt; can hear the harpsichord in a continuo.  But when in<br/>&gt; W III, string players find it vital.</p><p>Unexperienced and without knowldge of the historical background?<br/>Certainly.</p><p>&gt; Your lower  expectations will yield lesser results, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; afraid.</p><p>(here I scarcely can avoid a really insulting remark ...)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: But they can&apos;t consistently be performed by free<br/>&gt;&gt; intonating musicians as exact to the pitches created<br/>&gt;&gt; by the well-temperament in a fixed-pitch-instrument<br/>&gt;&gt; like a keyboard instrument.</p><p>&gt; JR: Yes they can.</p><p>Let&apos;s see - my ear and the sources contradict. To please you,<br/>let&apos;s take history and the sources aside:<br/>Hic Rhodos, hic salta - You claim it is possible, then give the<br/>proof.<br/>Certainly you have careful measurements from performances for<br/>each of the instruments playing in your ensemble. I want to know<br/>whether it is true, that there is one ensemble in the world<br/>which does, what no one else has achieved. And then when you can<br/>prove it, I&apos;ll help to spread the good news, honestly.<br/>Do you have a recording of which you might be able to have a<br/>fairly good real audio rendering - but that could follow the<br/>evidence you present by clear-cut acoustical measurements?</p><p>On the other hand I can only wonder, why you would want to<br/>enforce the rather bad thirds too be found too in Werckmeister<br/>III, a bunch even worse than equal, by trying to let the<br/>instruments play different sizes of major thirds of 400+x cents.<br/>And let&apos;s leave out for now the question what to  not speaking<br/>about the other even harder to control intervals</p><p>Actually, until proof is delivered - I think this<br/>Werckmeister-Ensemble-intonation is great fiction! And, however,<br/>irrelevant to the time of Werckmeister (read the sources, but<br/>now exactly!).</p><p>&gt;  One way is to treat WIII as a 12 note (or less) blues<br/>&gt; scale.  Some players actually like the cents values<br/>&gt; due to their training, others would run away from them.<br/>&gt;  But all love to get near the harpsichord.</p><p>Of course it is recommendable to be close to the continuo<br/>instrument so that you can hear the bass note to intonate on it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; (I&apos;ve already described the use of tape.)  Trumpets, no<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; problem so far (with its use of a minor third worth of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; interval bandwidth).</p><p>&gt; Ibo: And the effect of any temperament is and should be<br/>&gt; masked by the continuo-group, which to this aim should<br/>&gt; consist of several additional bass instruments, like a<br/>&gt; Violone, Gamba or Cello, Dulcian or Fagotto, etc. In<br/>&gt; this way it is better guaranteed, that the disturbing<br/>&gt; impure chords* from the keyboard instruments<br/>&gt; will not destroy the pure flexible intonation<br/>&gt; required from the non-continuo-players (and singers)</p><p>&gt; JR: There is nothing impure to mask.</p><p>Of course ...</p><p>&gt; Impurity base on later concepts of  vertical<br/>&gt; simultanaities do not apply to strict counterpoint.</p><p>as for example, major thirds of 402 cents or 408 cents, occuring<br/>in W III, are not pure by definition and even more so, by<br/>hearing them.</p><p>And the matter of well-temperament is not related to strict<br/>counterpoint.</p><p>&gt;  These are melodies that need further distinguishing,</p><p>If you use the appropriate period instruments and a singing<br/>technique as much as possible according to historical<br/>descriptions, this kind of &quot;distinguishing&quot; of polyphonic lines<br/>will not be needed. However, the historical as pure as possible<br/>intonation will enforce the natural overtones (to which the<br/>different parts can adjust to also quite well - contrary to an<br/>assumed performance &quot;in&quot; some WT or ET, as you claim unproven to<br/>be &quot;exactly&quot; possible)</p><p>&gt; which Werckmeister III is ideally suited to accomplish.</p><p>Thus spake the prophet.</p><p>&gt; When music becomes more chordal, only then do your<br/>&gt; ideas of &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; make any sense.</p><p>You would get the sense when you would achieve sufficient<br/>experience in performing by integrating knowledge from HIP.
