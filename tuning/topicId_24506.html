This<br/>approach, the  &quot;rationalization of an EDO&quot; is a complete<br/>flip on the thing, and certainly just as valid. (Generally<br/>anytime I find something that looks like 31EDO I recognize<br/>it... and I recognize how many MOS fit into EDOs WITHOUT<br/>having a particularly well supported low-limit<br/>interpretation...)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, an interesting rational interpretation exists for this scale<br/>&gt; as well based on a chain of five 13:16:19 triads,<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is pretty cool. I played with the 12-o-o-20 diatonic last week,<br/>and I&apos;ll try to wrap my ears around this.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
