I don&apos;t propose sonance definition as<br/>&gt;a measure in practical context. If 30001:20000 &quot;is&quot; very consonant, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;clearly because 30001:20000 &quot;is perceived&quot; as 3:2 ratio. Rationality of<br/>&gt;sonance, or rationality of width, are a matter of brain. 30001:20000 exists<br/>&gt;in (abstract) space of acoustical measured values, but don&apos;t exist in brain<br/>&gt;as category for sonance apprehension.</p><p>The problem with this model is that it would require an arbitrary range<br/>around every simple ratio, as well as a definition of which ratios are<br/>simple and which are not, and would allow the brain to hear any interval<br/>within the range as the central ratio, but those outside the range would be<br/>more dissonant, unless we crossed over into the range of a simpler ratio.<br/>Too many arbitrary assumptions for me, and more importantly, it disagrees<br/>with experience, which suggests a smooth sonance curve (such as the ones<br/>harmonic entropy or Helmholtz/Plomp/Sethares/Kameoka&amp;Kuriagawa methods<br/>produce).</p><p>And I still have no idea how temperament figures into your ratio-diagrams.</p><p>&gt;For example, I can translate and develop what I have soon written privately<br/>&gt;in french. We can construct three total distinct orders on all pairs of<br/>&gt;rationals in using criteria (ab) or (a+b) or max(a,b) for reduced ratio a/b<br/>&gt;in comparaison relation. With criteria</p><p>&gt;      (ab)    7/2 &lt; 3/5  for (7x2) &lt; (3X5)<br/>&gt;     (a+b)    7/2 &gt; 3/5  for (7+2) &gt; (3+5)<br/>&gt;  max(a,b)    7/2 &gt; 3/5  for (7) &gt; (5)</p><p>&gt;All rationals are completly ordered by one or other of these criteria. Two<br/>&gt;ratios can be equal but all ratios are comparable. These total orders are<br/>&gt;very different. Comparing 7/2, 3/5 et 7/1, we have (14)(15)(7) for (ab),<br/>&gt;(9)(8)(8) for (a+b) and (7)(5)(7) for max(a,b).</p><p>I have tried these very three criteria within the harmonic entropy<br/>calculation, and the resulting curves are quite similar locally, differing<br/>mainly in global features like overall slope (i.e., they agree when<br/>comparing intervals of similar sizes, but not intervals of very different<br/>sizes.</p><p>&gt;But partial order of adjacent ratios in Stern-Brocot tree is compatible<br/>&gt;with the three total orders defined.</p><p>OK, interesting!</p><p>&gt;(As you know, adjacent ratios a/b and<br/>&gt;c/d, on Stern-Brocot tree, are binded by relation ad - bc = 1).</p><p>As is true for the adjacent ratios in the set defined by an upper bound for<br/>any of the three criteria above.</p><p>Now, what does the partial ordering of the Stern-Brocot tree allow you to<br/>do?</p><p>&gt;What is important for music is what is perceived. But for mathematical<br/>&gt;standpoint, congruence is important. The three criteria have interesting<br/>&gt;properties. But the following examples showing octave translation pointed<br/>&gt;to (ab) as best candidate for logarithmic transformation.</p><p>&gt;          7/8  7/4  7/2  7/1  14/1        1/4  1/2   1   2/1  4/1</p><p>&gt;(ab)       56   28   14   7    14          4    2    1    2    4</p><p>&gt;(a+b)      15   11    9   8    15          5    3    1    3    5</p><p>&gt;max(a,b)    8    7    7   7    14          4    2    1    2    4</p><p>Please explain why (ab) is the best candidate. It&apos;s certainly a very<br/>attractive one, in that it allows Tenney&apos;s geometrical interpretation of<br/>harmonic distance using a rectangular lattice with prime axes (including 2)<br/>and units along each axis proportional to the log of the corresponding<br/>prime. But on the basis of perception, I find it hard to verify that, say,<br/>35:1 and 7:5 are identically sonant.</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;congruence&quot;?</p></div><h3>Paul H.

If it is (and<br/>&gt;it seems to be to me), then doesn&apos;t my formula also &apos;allow<br/>&gt;Tenney&apos;s geometrical interpretation of harmonic distance&apos;?</p><p>There are three important differences between Tenney&apos;s lattice distance and<br/>yours.</p><p>1. (most important) The version of Tenney&apos;s approach I&apos;m referring to here<br/>includes an axis for the prime 2. The correspondence between sonance and<br/>distance wouldn&apos;t work right for octave-invariant pitch classes mapped<br/>without a &quot;2&quot; axis -- the pitches have to be octave-specific.</p><p>2. Units along Tenney&apos;s axes are proportional to the log of the<br/>corresponding prime, while units along your axes are proportional to the<br/>prime itself.</p><p>3. Tenney&apos;s distance is a city-block distance -- one travels only parallel<br/>the axes, making sharp turns where necessary, never taking diagonal<br/>shortcuts across them. Though Tenney&apos;s lattice is usually considered to be<br/>rectangular, the angles between the axes are irrelevant, since all distances<br/>are measured along the axes in discrete steps. Meanwhile, I&apos;ve seen you<br/>measure distance in your lattice using Euclidean distance -- the length of a<br/>straight line connecting the points -- and hence your distance depends very<br/>strongly on the idiosyncratic angles that you use between your axes.<br/>Actually, in the two-dimensional representations you use, it is quite<br/>possible for two points very distant from one another in Tenney&apos;s lattice<br/>(even ignoring the &quot;2&quot; axis) to be virtually on top of one another in your<br/>lattice.</p></div>
