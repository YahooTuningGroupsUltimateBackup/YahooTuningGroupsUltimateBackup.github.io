First, although this was<br/>admittedly not so clear, I was simply making an illustration of<br/>principle independent of the period and the specific interval in<br/>question. I chose this example because the 7th is in the 30 cent<br/>range down from any other whole step down from the octave. Even so, I<br/>cannot see how one can say this in all instances across the board.</p><p>Bach is my all-time favorite composer, bar none. I have seen and<br/>heard scale-dominated passages where you go right up to the minor<br/>seventh and back down. This is not a terribly infrequent occurrence<br/>in Bach or other composers of the era. (Please don&apos;t ask me to quote<br/>any literature. I do not have anything specific in mind right now.)</p><p>To my ear, there is absolutely nothing rude, lude, shocking, or<br/>&quot;unidiomatic&quot; about going that bare sneak up to the perfect JI<br/>dominant seventh and back down. It works for me both melodically and<br/>harmonically, resolving beautifully to the third down from the 7th<br/>harmonic of a relative dominant in a melodically tight little lead-in<br/>interval that is harmonically satisfying as well. (This assumes the<br/>7th is not sounded on the keyboard simultaneously or in near<br/>proximity time-wise, and if the 3rd is sounded, this ssumes it&apos;s<br/>pretty pure.)</p><p>So.....???.........Don&apos;t get it. And how do we know it&apos;s<br/>&quot;unidiomiatic&quot; (?), since we can research documentation on what<br/>tuning systems were used for keyboards to some degree, but what<br/>violinists actually did with their fingers intonation-wise is a bit<br/>of a tougher one, I would say. I suspect they did what sounds good to<br/>any well-trained, melodically and harmonically sensitive ear today as<br/>long as that ear is not totally biased toward modernity through lack<br/>of exposure to just intervals.

Maybe it is because this is how the musicians in my<br/>milieu work.  I play in strict Werckmeister on my alto recorder, for example.<br/> It is certainly as easy as playing in strict 12-tET.

Even my keyboard<br/>players can hear.</p><p>&gt; 1) They will conform to the keyboard temperament only when the<br/>&gt; harmonic structure currently being played on the keyboard dictates<br/>&gt; it. This is a spontaneous adaptation that is intuitive, just as for a<br/>&gt; singer with a highly developed ear.</p><p>You may be describing general current practice as you have experienced it,<br/>but we are exploring different performance practices.  First off, only when<br/>you play in a tuning like Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic can you &quot;believe&quot; it<br/>enough that it could never be considered inferior, or unachievable.  And when<br/>a continuo instrument is tuned into such a temperament, it behooves all the<br/>members of the ensemble to take this reality into account.  Most continuo<br/>parts are improvised so there is no real telling which notes the keyboard<br/>will include or exclude on any given chord.</p><p>&gt; 2) The rest of the time, they will play whatever is the &quot;best fit&quot;<br/>&gt; harmonically with the pattern of pitches currently being executed on<br/>&gt; the keyboard. If the keyboardist is playing a clean C-G-C with no<br/>&gt; third and a violinist is playing the minor seventh, the m7 will<br/>&gt; intuitively go to the 7th harmonic so the structure is 4:6:7:8. This is<br/>&gt; UTTERLY independent of where the m7 is tuned on the keyboard, unless<br/>&gt; it was recently sounded on the keyboard in a manner that would<br/>&gt; produce a jarring melodic impression whether in a single melodic line<br/>&gt; or one of several in a polyphonic texture.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree with Paul, here.  The Harmonic 7/4 seventh was indicated by Bach&apos;s<br/>student Kirnberger by the letter &quot;i&quot; placed before the minor seventh.  This<br/>alone makes one think that there is a structural and functional difference<br/>between the 16/9 and the 7/4.</p><p>&gt; 3) They will continually and intuitively make &quot;engineering tradeoffs&quot;<br/>&gt; between the latter kind of melodic or polyphonic contexts for a given<br/>&gt; pitch and the &quot;best fit&quot; within its vertical harmonic nest.<br/>&gt;<br/>The above is often true in common practice today.  However, it is not true<br/>for Bach in his backyard at the start of the 18th century.  This is<br/>specialized work, perhaps, but it does add new dimensions to Bach&apos;s music.<br/>And that is why we pursue these matters.</p><p>&gt; I consider it simplistic to imagine that a solo violinist, including<br/>&gt; Bach himself, would or even could play the Unaccompanied Sonatas and<br/>&gt; Partitas to conform with Werckmeister&apos;s temperament simply because it<br/>&gt; was Bach&apos;s preference for tuning his keyboards.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Then you misjudge me, and underestimate Bach.</p><p>&gt; Respectfully yours,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>8/22/2001 10:50:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Johnny! Not wishing to insult or underestimate anyone, not you<br/>and certainly not Bach!

If the keyboardist is playing a clean C-G-C with<br/>no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; third and a violinist is playing the minor seventh, the m7 will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intuively go to the 7th harmonic so the structure is 4:6:7:8.<br/>&gt; This<br/>&gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; UTTERLY independent of where the m7 is tuned on the keyboard,<br/>&gt; &gt; unless<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it was recently sounded on the keyboard in a manner that would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; produce a jarring melodic impression whether in a single<br/>melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; line<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or one of several in a polyphonic texture.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In performing Bach, you could _never_ get away with playing the<br/>7th<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic in this context. Even if it fits harmonically, which is<br/>&gt; &gt; arguable, the melodic intervals leading to and away from this<br/>tone<br/>&gt; &gt; would be prohibitively unidiomatic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmmm....so final about that, Paul?! First, although this was<br/>&gt; admittedly not so clear, I was simply making an illustration of<br/>&gt; principle independent of the period and the specific interval in<br/>&gt; question. I chose this example because the 7th is in the 30 cent<br/>&gt; range down from any other whole step down from the octave. Even so,<br/>I<br/>&gt; cannot see how one can say this in all instances across the board.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bach is my all-time favorite composer, bar none. I have seen and<br/>&gt; heard scale-dominated passages where you go right up to the minor<br/>&gt; seventh and back down. This is not a terribly infrequent occurrence<br/>&gt; in Bach or other composers of the era. (Please don&apos;t ask me to<br/>quote<br/>&gt; any literature. I do not have anything specific in mind right now.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To my ear, there is absolutely nothing rude, lude, shocking, or<br/>&gt; &quot;unidiomatic&quot; about going that bare sneak up to the perfect JI<br/>&gt; dominant seventh and back down. It works for me both melodically<br/>and<br/>&gt; harmonically, resolving beautifully to the third down from the 7th<br/>&gt; harmonic of a relative dominant in a melodically tight little lead-<br/>in<br/>&gt; interval that is harmonically satisfying as well. (This assumes the<br/>&gt; 7th is not sounded on the keyboard simultaneously or in near<br/>&gt; proximity time-wise, and if the 3rd is sounded, this ssumes it&apos;s<br/>&gt; pretty pure.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So.....???.........Don&apos;t get it. And how do we know it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;unidiomiatic&quot; (?), since we can research documentation on what<br/>&gt; tuning systems were used for keyboards to some degree, but what<br/>&gt; violinists actually did with their fingers intonation-wise is a bit<br/>&gt; of a tougher one, I would say. I suspect they did what sounds good<br/>to<br/>&gt; any well-trained, melodically and harmonically sensitive ear today<br/>as<br/>&gt; long as that ear is not totally biased toward modernity through<br/>lack<br/>&gt; of exposure to just intervals.

I don&apos;t believe you can say a lust for just is always in<br/>the cards.  There are performance techniques that were different back then<br/>which aid in this tuning usage, most obviously the continuo itself.  Frankly,<br/>a solo melody instrument is not aided in its richness because it is in a just<br/>tuning.  It depends on the writing. Bach added many different harmonies in<br/>double, and triple stops.  His 6th cello suite was for an instrument with<br/>even a lower harmony added, the viola pomposa.  All melody is harmony for<br/>Bach, and this is why it is not difficult to play modally for a solo work,<br/>keeping to a tuning.  Certainly on a recorder, it&apos;s a breeze (pardon the pun).</p><p>&gt; Temperaments arose for reasons unrelated to instruments that have<br/>&gt; infinite pitch flexibility. I consequently don&apos;t see why an<br/>&gt; unaccompanied soloist should bother to adopt any temperament as a<br/>&gt; template for intonational performance.</p><p>How rare is it to hear any pop vocalist singing in 12-tET or pure just?  All<br/>sorts of melodic connections are made for musical reasons.  Baroque musicians<br/>would had recourse to hear and internalize all the Werckmeister<br/>relationships.  And there were only 12.  It is a 12 note Blues scale,<br/>essentially.  I&apos;ve played in it quite a bit and feel quite comfortable with<br/>it.  The only solo work for winds by Bach is Bach in B Minor, which mirrors<br/>equal temperament in Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic.</p><p>Although I&apos;m sure the melodic<br/>&gt; patterns that habitual playing with tempered instruments always has<br/>&gt; its influence, I doubt unaccompanied soloists consciously attempted<br/>&gt; to do this historically and it seems to me a totally unnatural,<br/>&gt; academic artifice to do so today.</p><p>On my concerts players consciously play all of their intonation when doing<br/>early music.  It is essentially the pedigree to be performed on my concerts.</p><p>Years ago I had the wonderful opportunity to perform with Odetta on one of my<br/>concerts.  She sang without guitar (at my request) a number of hollars,<br/>children&apos;s songs, and a powerful work called &quot;Black Woman.&quot;  She spent<br/>serious woodshedding time working out the curly cues in the tuning so that<br/>she would produce exactly the intonation she knew to be right.  As a superb<br/>folk singer, she must capture exactly the intonation of the folk.

My choir<br/>doesn&apos;t even know what meantone is, but under properly trained,<br/>rehearsed and other ideal circumstances, they sponataneously use<br/>adaptive JI because their ears have been trained to seek just<br/>harmonic intervallic relationships among their parts.</p><p>Paul had said:<br/>Considering that Bach wrote polyphonic music, where the melodies had<br/>&gt; strong motivic relationships with one another, and directional<br/>&gt; tendencies, based on intervals that normally came in only two sizes<br/>&gt; per type (not three or more as in just intonation), or at least are<br/>&gt; notated that way, wouldn&apos;t it appear &quot;authentic&quot;, rather than &quot;a<br/>&gt; totally unnatural, academic artific&quot; to you, to in some measure<br/>&gt; respect these characteristics? Wouldn&apos;t you want to play the<br/>melodies<br/>&gt; as Bach heard them in his head?</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>&quot;In some measure&quot; is key here. I have recognized that habitual<br/>playing with tempered instruments has its influence. I just don&apos;t<br/>believe it&apos;s realistic to imagine that string and other<br/>intonationally flexible performers explicitly set about with<br/>conscious deliberation to conform to some tempered template. This<br/>strikes me as arising from some kind of current idealism that is not<br/>essential for explaining the historical realities, whatever they<br/>might have been.</p><p>Perhaps this harks back to an earlier mild lack of convergence in our<br/>opinions, Paul, concerning the relative importance of melodic versus<br/>harmonic precision in tuning intervals. I believe that the human ear<br/>detects harmonic imprecision much more readily than sequential,<br/>melodic imprecision. On the other hand, it is indeed necessary in<br/>order to justly tune in musically faster-moving contexts, to have a<br/>melodic sense of the shifting width of intervals.</p><p>I personally, when in good practice, notice that I make the comma<br/>difference between first and second whole steps of a major scale, and<br/>certainly between diatonic and chromatic half-steps, but these<br/>melodically subtle microtonal differences would be large, hugely<br/>significant, and intolerable errors if they represented deviations<br/>from JI in harmonic tuning.</p><p>When playing with other instruments or double stopping, I naturally<br/>seek pure JI intervals. However, when I play with a tempered<br/>instrument, I just play whatever sounds well tuned, and the<br/>adaptation is quite spontaneous and unconscious. The temperament<br/>simply moves my ear as far from JI as is needed to sound in accord<br/>with it.</p><p>Whenever, something is held long enough for the discrepancies to<br/>cause pain to the ear, a violinist has ways to quickly fudge and<br/>adapt, as you have so aptly pointed out, Paul. What even very good<br/>musicians with fine ears notice is that it sounds very precisely in<br/>tune. Rarely if ever do people find the slight melodic shifts needed<br/>for this fudging very notiecable.</p><p>Why should it have been different in Bach&apos;s time? Temperaments have a<br/>good reason for existing on fixed-pitch instruments, at least before<br/>the digital age and still on most acoustic instruments. More flexible<br/>instruments don&apos;t require tempering.</p><p>I have run across one reference in this group to an &quot;equal-tempered<br/>sax&quot;. As a wind player also, I find this amusing. Brass and other<br/>wind intruments are quite intonationally flexible. They&apos;re not<br/>confined to any specific temperament just because the factory<br/>adjustments used 12-EDO as the calibration standard.</p><p>So why should we imagine that Bach or anyone else &quot;heard these<br/>melodies in their heads&quot; in such a way as to preclude subtle,<br/>microtonal shifts in their intervals sequentially played. Even in<br/>Bach&apos;s polyphonic contexts to which you refer, often the thematic<br/>material shifts so that such gross distinctions as whole and half<br/>steps fall in different locations occasionally.</p><p>So who&apos;s to worry about whether the M2s are 9/8, 10/9, or the same<br/>size when considered as a strictly MELODIC issue? I don&apos;t mean here<br/>to contradict myself on the need make these melodic distinctions in<br/>order to play harmonically in tune with tempered instruments. I just<br/>dont&apos; think anyone, including Bach, cared much about these subtle<br/>melodic differences outside of compatability with harmonic<br/>considerations.</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>8/22/2001 5:02:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny:<br/>In contradistinction: if I sang a plaintive microtonal melody to you,<br/>wouldn&apos;t you learn it by rote identically, if that was indeed your<br/>wish?<br/>Ever hear an imitator imitate a celebrity&apos;s voice?

I am<br/>&gt;not referring to melodic schemes that contain shifts of 5 cents in<br/>&gt;pitch. I think that would seem to them the same way it does to me<br/>&gt;when I&apos;m thinking in terms of Baroque harmony: a tuning slide and not<br/>&gt;a separate, discrete pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The multiple 31-tone keyboard schemes referred to in some threads<br/>&gt;here were not put in place as microtonal systems, but strictly out of<br/>&gt;a motivation to achieve mechanically accesible just harmonies. The<br/>&gt;&quot;blues&quot; and other folk melodic concepts therefore do not apply, I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t think, to analysis of these issues for this music. To attempt<br/>&gt;to apply it is to my mind, a superimposition of our times onto<br/>&gt;theirs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You do not need web access to participate.

To minimize the errors in the first part of the<br/>process, don&apos;t your singers, intuitively and because of experience,<br/>sing meantone-like _melodic_ intervals, as a way of &quot;aiming&quot; for the<br/>adaptively just target that they want to hit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally, when in good practice, notice that I make the comma<br/>&gt; difference between first and second whole steps of a major scale,</p><p>Depending on what the underlying harmony is, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whenever, something is held long enough for the discrepancies to<br/>&gt; cause pain to the ear, a violinist has ways to quickly fudge and<br/>&gt; adapt, as you have so aptly pointed out, Paul.

Also, there are different<br/>&gt; types of harmonic logic -- Pythagorean was the standard tuning in<br/>the<br/>&gt; West from about 800-1420 (I&apos;ll let Margo address the finer points<br/>of<br/>&gt; this generalization).&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; Agreed! However, I believe the Gothic preference for perfect fifths<br/>&gt; and fourths as consonances evolved naturally toward the newly<br/>&gt; perceived consonance of thirds in the Renaissance because of the<br/>&gt; prominence of a cappella vocal music in the church.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Pythagorean 3-limit tuning was something THEORISTS hung onto<br/>for<br/>&gt; a long time because they were dealing with fixed pitches and<br/>&gt; vocalists were forced to conform. (There was also the symbolism of<br/>&gt; the Trinity in 3-limit). When this constraint was removed for a<br/>&gt; sufficiently significant time and intensity of practice, bang, the<br/>&gt; thirds suddenly shone forth as consonant.</p><p>I think it&apos;s the other way around. I think the constraint was removed<br/>in the _theory_, in the early 16th century, because already in<br/>_practice_ for a century or two (depending on geographic locale)<br/>thirds and sixths were being used as consonances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob also said:<br/>&gt; &gt; Bach&apos;s polyphonic contexts to which you refer, often the thematic<br/>&gt; &gt; material shifts so that such gross distinctions as whole and half<br/>&gt; &gt; steps fall in different locations occasionally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:<br/>&gt; Well I think very powerful tonal effects are intended, and<br/>realized,<br/>&gt; in such circumstances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; Of course, but the melodic conformity to the general outline of the<br/>&gt; melody was preserved anyway. It didn&apos;t matter so much that the<br/>&gt; intervals were not precisley in imitation of the original theme.</p><p>I think it mattered a lot -- it has a huge tonal implication.</p><p>&gt; This<br/>&gt; is precisely my point. How much more would he be willing to admit<br/>&gt; microtonal differences within the same interval type if the harmony<br/>&gt; constrains it that way?</p><p>I see the line of reasoning but it doesn&apos;t ring true for me. It&apos;s<br/>very easy to sound &quot;melodically out-of-tune&quot; as well as &quot;harmonically<br/>out-of-tune&quot;.</p><p>Listen to Blackwood&apos;s piece in 17-tET. It&apos;s in a fairly traditional,<br/>tonal style. By all accounts, 5-limit harmony should be positively<br/>horrible in this tuning. But due to the choice of timbres, voicings,<br/>and most importantly the strength of the melody, the piece sounds<br/>absolutely wonderful.

However, I believe the Gothic preference for perfect fifths<br/>&gt; and fourths as consonances evolved naturally toward the newly<br/>&gt; perceived consonance of thirds in the Renaissance because of the<br/>&gt; prominence of a cappella vocal music in the church. &gt;<br/>&gt; The Pythagorean 3-limit tuning was something THEORISTS hung onto<br/>for<br/>&gt; a long time because they were dealing with fixed pitches and<br/>&gt; vocalists were forced to conform. (There was also the symbolism of<br/>&gt; the Trinity in 3-limit). When this constraint was removed for a<br/>&gt; sufficiently significant time and intensity of practice, bang, the<br/>&gt; thirds suddenly shone forth as consonant.</p><p>Paul replied:<br/>I think it&apos;s the other way around. I think the constraint was removed<br/>in the _theory_, in the early 16th century, because already in<br/>_practice_ for a century or two (depending on geographic locale)<br/>thirds and sixths were being used as consonances.</p><p>Bob Answers:<br/>How does this contradict what I&apos;ve said? I only see that it puts a<br/>broad timing on the phenomenon to which I refer...something I hadn&apos;t<br/>bothered to specify. You too imply here that the theory was<br/>responding to practice, which is the essence of my point. And the<br/>practice evolved in a cappella music that allowed human ears to find<br/>their intuitive way harmonically, unshackled by theoretical<br/>constraints.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2001 2:09:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; This is a little vague... maybe I&apos;d better drop it and stick with<br/>&gt; the &quot;multi dimensional&quot; while I was ahead...  :)</p><p>I beg you not to drop anything.

Your point<br/>underscores<br/>&gt; &gt; mine<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as I see it. In a microtonally precise sense, there is no<br/>exact<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; melodic imitation in the first place in Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wrote,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The largest major second in Werckmeister is Pythagorean. The<br/>&gt; &gt; smallest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is less than 12 cents narrower. Even in the few keys where<br/>these<br/>&gt; &gt; come<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in succession in the scale, the effect is much less jagged than<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; full comma difference. In fact it doesn&apos;t sound jagged at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point being, on a purely melodic level, Werckmeister doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; create the melodic jaggedness that I sometimes find in melodies<br/>which<br/>&gt; alternate 9/8 and 10/9 whole steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And when I ask:<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyone proposing that we split the perfect fifth into two equal<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals in the interest of melodic integrity??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You answer:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This can be a great effect _melodically_, found in many world<br/>&gt; &gt; musics,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and in Blackwood&apos;s 14-tET etude, for example.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How far out of context are we going to go with this? If JI whole<br/>&gt; &gt; steps are unidiomatic in Bach, how do we take the world musics<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; Blackwood composition you just mentioned above!!?????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point is that different styles have different aesthetics<br/>&gt; concerning melody. Melody isn&apos;t always concerned with mimicking a<br/>&gt; harmonic series. The level to which it is depends on musical style.<br/>&gt; In Indian music, even 8:9:10 is very appropriate, given the<br/>&gt; sustaining drone and its overtones and the nature of the melodies.<br/>In<br/>&gt; many non-harmonic world musics, dividing a perfect fifth into two<br/>&gt; audibly equal melodic parts is important for the effect. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; suggesting that Western common-practice music falls somewhere in-<br/>&gt; between.</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/24/2001 2:54:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27374">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27374</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is a little vague... maybe I&apos;d better drop it and stick with<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;multi dimensional&quot; while I was ahead...  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I beg you not to drop anything.

But to break away<br/>from my earlier tradition-fed perspectives, I had to do radical things.

Since the wall came down, I have been<br/>able to visit what had been only fabled towns of yore.</p><p>Actually, keeping the notes of Werckmeister together is a musical talent, an<br/>it really is like remembering a 12-note blues scale.  I had the opportunity<br/>to teach a modern orchestra to play baroque operas in meantone.  Only the<br/>horn players had any real difficulty.</p><p>Now, while Werckmeister becomes a grid for the mind to measure before<br/>playing, I&apos;m sure there is expressivity above and below the targeted note.<br/>The level of playing was often quite low in Bach&apos;s experience, many of which<br/>were students.</p><p>Still, there was nothing else!  There were no other chromatic tunings.  If<br/>one was a chromatic composer -and player- then to deviate from the grid would<br/>be to embellish or cherish, but within the tonal context set up by the<br/>temperament.

The difference between<br/>&gt;&gt;grounding to 12-tET and grounding to COFT is a subtle one.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Not as I recall -- when you first made the change, all the audible<br/>&gt;problems disappeared (from the Back)!</p><p>Hmmm... my recollection is that it took awhile after the spring/COFT<br/>model to finally get a version of the Bach that you liked (on that day,<br/>I opened a bottle of champagne! ;-&gt; ).  One of the later things was<br/>handling a half-diminished 7th chord (E, G, Bb, D) with a utonal 5-limit<br/>file, to avoid a pythagorean major third at the top (!).  Of course, now<br/>we have a tuning-file-free option as well, and for 5-limit, I tend to<br/>use that nowadays (as we&apos;ve discussed, that high 7th degree in a dom 7th<br/>took me some time to accept).</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Right now I only spring consecutive instances of the same pitch class.<br/>&gt;&gt;Of course two springs in series do indirectly form a (weaker) spring<br/>&gt;&gt;between the outlying notes as well.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Can you give an example??</p><p>If we look at three consecutive instances of the E pitch class, E-E-E, I<br/>put a spring where each &quot;-&quot; is.  For the outer two to move relative to<br/>each other, there is an effective spring formed by the two actual<br/>springs, with k2 = 1 / (1/k0 + 1/k1).  Yes?  Of course, it&apos;s not _quite_<br/>the same thing as including a specific spring between the outer two.<br/>The model itself would of course accommodate such additional springs<br/>without difficulty, though with slightly slowed convergence during the<br/>relaxation phase.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For most of my time on this list, you have been most critical of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;horizontal motion in my tuning experiments; do I have that well<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;under control now?</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;There was never a problem once you adopted the COFT methodology. In<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;fact, I wonder what would happen if you now eliminated the horizontal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;springs altogether.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I don&apos;t think you&apos;d like it!

Joe?</p><p>First the harpsichordist was tuned.  Difficult to phrase with confidence at<br/>first in the new tuning? A lot of reaction time in listening hard to the new<br/>sounds, really quite subtle, and yet of increasing interest.</p><p>The flutist was Andrew Bolotowsky and the oboist Ron Kozak, virtuoso<br/>microtonalists. They knew how to use a tuning machine and to match cents<br/>figures with specific fingerings and/or particular embouchure matched with<br/>appropriate velocity.</p><p>Fingerings are devised using the open tone holes and unusual key combinations<br/>that allow for just about any pitches.</p><p>The strings that have performed with the AFMM most are the most comfortable,<br/>which shouldn&apos;t seem like a surprise.  Once again, it&apos;s like learning a<br/>12-note blues scale playing in Werckmeister.  Quarter comma meantone is<br/>easier as there are less differences (except in varieties of meantones). I<br/>have often used an alto recorder that has been scotch taped into a particular<br/>tuning as the model for a tuning (for quarter comma and sixth comma<br/>ensembles).</p><p>Brass must first be based on the correct fundamental.  Horns will have to do<br/>partial shadings of the bell, which are damn hard to remember exactly.  Greg<br/>Evans is a master, and a member of the AFMM Board of Directors.  Trumpets<br/>need an extra quartertone piston, unless they are John Charles Thomas.  Tuba<br/>player Dave Grego plays a quartertone tuba, which allows for so many new<br/>combinations, that any pitch can be gotten.</p><p>Hearing in the head accurate to a cent is a valuable tool to playing these<br/>tunings acceptably well.  Sure the instrument may not give off the exact<br/>pitch intended.  But the pitch must be intended more accurately in the mind<br/>than sometimes elicited, and not the other way around.</p><p>Singers seem to be political about the whole thing.  They seem to convince<br/>themselves more of what ought to be and shy away from theory, especially if<br/>it is contrary to experience.  Throughout history singers were considered<br/>apart from instrumentalists, not real musicians, but singers.  I do not want<br/>to encourage this notion, but singers really just want to lock in, to feel<br/>comfortable singing, with as little thinking as possible.

I&apos;m not advocating the abandonment of melodic<br/>considerations, but considering that all our western scales have<br/>been constructed on the basis of harmonic relationships, western<br/>melodic relationships, in my view, should never veer too far away<br/>from harmonic relationships.</p><p>The shift in melodic relationships with key in Werckmeisters&apos;<br/>temperament do not occur in the absence of shifts in harmonic<br/>relationships.

You see, I find more variation in Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>chromatic than in any other well-temperament.  It is the ur-wohltermeratur.<br/>It RETAINS important melodic difference between keys.  It is the steady<br/>gradation of key morphing that distinguishes it.</p><p>&gt; Is there any 12-tone well-temperament that does _not_ favor<br/>&gt; Pythagorean?<br/>&gt;<br/>No, which says a lot for the importance of melody over harmony, at least<br/>where Werckmeister is concerned.  Of course, the placement of all those<br/>melodies is harmony, and chord harmony is really quite basic.  It was so<br/>BASIC that keyboard players were expected to make up the chords out of their<br/>heads extemporaneously...even Bach!  The chords made it possible to play in<br/>all the keys.  But if you knew the chord possibilities for major and minor,<br/>then 1 key was like another to Bach.  Later generations heard the differences<br/>between the keys and their affectations, but it hadn&apos;t happened by Bach.  You<br/>see Bach didn&apos;t modulate between keys, he explored all the relationships in a<br/>tonal way he could.  A modulation was from one chord to another chord.
