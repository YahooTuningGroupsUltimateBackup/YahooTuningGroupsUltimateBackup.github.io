I also administer<br/>Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Xenharmonic Alliance&rdquo; group, a counterpart to the list,<br/>found athttps://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/. We&rsquo;re overjoyed<br/>to see that you&rsquo;ve decided to implement Sagittal!</p><p>We believe that our community has a powerful contribution to make to<br/>21st century music. Yet, though the overall size of group is very<br/>large, far too often we&rsquo;ve been ignored by the music software<br/>community, leaving us with a dearth of tools we need to actually make<br/>music. This in turn causes us to make less music, turns newcomers off<br/>from the community, which finally causes us to be ignored more by<br/>major software developers, in a vicious circle. That you&rsquo;ve taken the<br/>initiative to give us a major piece of software with Sagittal support<br/>is a huge step forward for us, and we&rsquo;re very excited about this!</p><p>The question on everyone&rsquo;s mind is: do you intend to implement<br/>microtonal playback support as well?</p><p>The microtonal community would be elated if there existed even a<br/>cursory, easy-to-implement, workable solution for us to actually hear<br/>our scores played back in the tunings which we&rsquo;ve composed them in. It<br/>would be a huge advancement for our group to have even something which<br/>only solves the problem halfway, but which integrates in a larger<br/>workflow with other tools that we currently use to arrive at the<br/>solution. We recognize that now, in this crucial development phase of<br/>this new software, would be a good time to make our voices heard!</p><p>I invite you to stop by at the tuning list as well, should you desire<br/>any general feedback from our community, as well as clarity on precise<br/>mathematical and technical recommendations on which simple things<br/>would benefit the most microtonalists. And again, THANK YOU for<br/>implementing Sagittal, and enabling the larger microtonal community to<br/>finally take a leap forward &ndash; we&rsquo;re all watching this blog very<br/>carefully!</p><p>Best,<br/>Mike Battaglia</p><p>----</p><p>On Wed, Aug 7, 2013 at 4:01 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;<a href="mailto:battaglia01@gmail.com">battaglia01@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...Wow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the group that we assumed wouldn&apos;t be receptive to anything, right?<br/>&gt; I remember we were in agreement before that we need to make our requests to<br/>&gt; them minimalist, and we got into a discussion about just how minimalist we<br/>&gt; can make things and still have them all work out.

And get playback with pitch bends that can be converted<br/>to MTS.

They&apos;re even harder if you want<br/>those accidentals to be tied to playback and work with transpositions.</p><p>There are weirder notations like my tricycle, where the extra symbols<br/>don&apos;t correspond to small intervals, but place the pitch in one of<br/>three categories.  The notation for that can be as strange as you<br/>like.  I currently implement it as fingerings because Lilypond has<br/>support for fingerings.

I&apos;ll give up all hope<br/>&gt; of using MTS and etc in favor of just arriving at the simplest way<br/>&gt; possible for playback.</p><p>MTS is fine and works, even if only with Timidity.  If some other<br/>format worked with the built-in synth, that would be fine as well.  You<br/>only need one way to preview the music.  MTS is about as simple as it<br/>gets, though (at least if you ignore the things that make it less<br/>simple) and once it puts the information there you can convert it to<br/>any other format you like.</p><p>Tuning table support is good as well.  There are some cases where you<br/>want a fixed pitch set and others where you don&apos;t.  I like full support<br/>for scordablature, so if you&apos;re going to have MIDI output for a tuning<br/>table, have a score indicating what somebody would play on a normal<br/>keyboard to produce it.  That might help in getting a professional<br/>quality performance.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div>
