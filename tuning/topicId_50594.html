All you need is to interpolate between a number of static tunings.  Set one of these for when all generators are 0, and another for when each generator is at its maximum extent.  At least, that works for a single generator, and something like it would for more.  I&apos;ve played with this in Kyma, and it&apos;s good for experimenting, so you can find your preferred generator size by ear.</p><p>Robert Walker was doing something similar for Fractal Tune Smithy, but I don&apos;t know where it ended up.  At least, you can control the fifth size for meantone tunings.</p><p>Okay, let&apos;s think.  With two generators, x and y, we define the scale s(0,0) when they&apos;re both zero.  Then have s(1,0) and s(0,1) for the two orthogonal extremes.  So you can get s(x,0) = s(0,0)*(1-x) + s(1,0)*x and s(0,y) = s(0,0)*(1-y) + s(0,1)*y.  In general, say s(x,y) = s(0,0) + [s(1,0) - s(0,0)]*x + [s(0,1) - s(0,0)]*y.  Yes, I think that works! And it should generalize for any number of generators.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=50989 href="#50989">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2004 2:32:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It needn&apos;t be that complicated.</p><p>Yeah, right.
