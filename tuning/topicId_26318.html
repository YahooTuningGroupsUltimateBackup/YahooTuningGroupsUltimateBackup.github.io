For example, this<br/>chromatic semitone would occur as Eb-E.</p><p>As I recall, the term _chroma_ around 1540 also refers to the note<br/>value of half of a semiminim or crotchet, or in modern terms a quaver<br/>or eighth note. Thus the term &quot;chromatic madrigal&quot; in that epoch often<br/>referred not to chromaticism (although became a feature of the<br/>emerging Manneristic style as used by composers such as Rore and the<br/>young Lasso), but to the use of smaller note values or &quot;black notes&quot;<br/>(_note nere_).</p><p>Of course, as people such as Dave Keenan have recognized in their<br/>efforts to devise consistent and descriptive interval naming systems,<br/>the concept of 25:24 as a _chromatic_ semitone assumes certain<br/>stylistic patterns, here a 5-limit intonation.</p><p>As it happens, Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone has a chromatic semitone<br/>at precisely 25:24, while in 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 major<br/>thirds, this semitone is slightly larger (~76.05 cents).</p><p>However, in neo-Gothic music based on 17-tET, for example, the<br/>_diatonic_ semitone (e.g. E-F, B-C) is equal to almost exactly this<br/>same ratio of 25:24 or ~70.67 cents -- it&apos;s 1/17 octave (~70.59<br/>cents).</p><p>While I&apos;m not sure what role 33:32 plays in 11-limit music, I would<br/>call it very nice size for a small neo-Gothic semitone.</p><p>Anyway, on the chroma vs. comma distinction, I might describe it like<br/>this.</p><p>The syntonic comma of 81:80 (~21.51 cents) is in 16th-century<br/>technique not an interval which would explicitly occur in a notated<br/>piece, although it is the theoretical difference in size between the<br/>two whole-tones of Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic as adapted by Zarlino,<br/>at 9:8 and 10:9 (together forming a pure 5:4 third).</p><p>In contrast, the chromatic semitone may occur as a direct melodic<br/>interval in more adventurous pieces, and would ideally be 25:24 if the<br/>singers are approximating 5-limit JI.</p><p>Note that Zarlino himself takes the position that while the syntonic<br/>diatonic defines the natural ratios toward which voices tend, singers<br/>can and will make adjustments to avoid dissonances such as a 40:27<br/>&quot;Wolf fifth.&quot; While this is suggested by a statement that he makes in<br/>his treatise of 1558, he deals with the point at more length in his<br/>_Musical Supplements_ of 1588.</p><p>In other words, what Zarlino apparently sees happening in practice is<br/>some kind of adaptive JI, with the flexibility of voices making<br/>possible a close _approximation_ of the syntonic diatonic, and more<br/>specifically its pure vertical intervals.</p><p>One way of expressing the difference between the chroma and the comma<br/>is that the difference of a chroma affects the rules of counterpoint;<br/>the difference of a comma does not have this effect. In other words,<br/>Zarlino makes a distinction between a major third and a minor third<br/>(e.g. closest-approach progressions m3-1 and M3-5), but not, at least<br/>in the same way, between a theoretical 9:8 or 10:9 major second.</p><p>One partial exception to this statement might be a passage in 1558<br/>about the issue of parallel thirds, where Zarlino says that some of<br/>these movements may have more variety than others because of the<br/>differences in the sizes of melodic steps.</p><p>However, I would generally agree with scholars such as Carl Dahlhaus<br/>and Karol Berger that the chromatic semitone, but not the syntonic<br/>comma, makes a difference in musical grammar, so to speak, as well as<br/>in the tuning system.</p><p>In other words, I agree with Paul Erlich that if we realize this music<br/>in some appropriate shading of meantone, where the comma is dispersed,<br/>the musical grammar and meaning is accurately communicated, with what<br/>might be considered either the compromise or the sonorous pleasantries<br/>of temperament. Mark Lindley, for example, prefers meantone to 12-tET<br/>for some of Milan&apos;s pieces in part because he likes the &quot;warmth&quot; of<br/>the distinctly beating fifths.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=26332 href="#26332">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/19/2001 7:48:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26318.html#26318">/tuning/topicId_26318.html#26318</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Joe Pehrson and everyone, and please let me try to<br/>&gt; answer at least part of your question about the term _chroma_,<br/>&gt; specifically this term as applied to the 25:24.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you *very* much, Margo, for your response to this.
