I can&apos;t see complex harmonies working well in,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;say, maqam saba&grave; -- I don&apos;t have a very robust tolerance for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;dissonance -- but an adjusted timbre might result in some interesting<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;experiments: Palestrina meets Simon Shaheen.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;--<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;William S.

Also, a given note, such as saba, is going to occupy<br/>&gt;a different region depending on the maqam in which it appears.  This<br/>&gt;is certainly true in Arabic music.  This presents a notational<br/>&gt;nightmare of course, because what gets notated as E-quarter-flat in<br/>&gt;maqam rast may be different than the E-quarter-flat in maqam bayati.</p><p>**********************************************************************</p><p>You hit it right on the head. &quot;Region&quot; is the key word here. I presume<br/>you are referring to what I call &apos;distributions&apos; or &apos;smears&apos; in my post.<br/>However, what I am beginning to observe is that a given &apos;note&apos;, say<br/>E-quarter-flat, with a certain name &quot;$%^&amp;&quot; varies in pitch not only from<br/> one maqam to another, but within the course of an improvisation in the<br/>same maqam. This is why I am suggesting smears on the pitch axis as<br/>opposed to discrete points, as on fretted or keyboard instruments. The<br/>mystery is getting deeper and more fascinating in my investigations.</p><p>**********************************************************************</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Therefore, I do not believe a fixed tuning, no matter<br/>&gt; &gt;how intricate, is the answer for Turkish music and possibly other musics.<br/>&gt; &gt;The concept of &apos;tuning&apos; has to be viewed in a revolutionary manner with a<br/>&gt; &gt;fluid  and dynamic structure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        It has been argued that fixed tuning/notation isn&apos;t so great<br/>&gt;for recording western music, either.  Certainly folk musicians of<br/>&gt;various sorts complain about notational limitations.  But Sibelius is<br/>&gt;still going to be a great tool, so long as you have the space to make<br/>&gt;a note someplace that the note saba is the 4-comma version, instead of<br/>&gt;the 5-comma version in the piece you&apos;re working on.  (I keep abusing<br/>&gt;the note saba, and the maqam... I could be wrong on precise details,<br/>&gt;but I believe I&apos;m making my point clear.)</p><p>*******************************************************************</p><p>For Turkish music what is needed is a software that can &apos;think&apos; for<br/>making decisions in selecting the right pitch for a given note with<br/>a given name at a given moment during the course of the &apos;seyir&apos; used<br/>by the performing musician. The software needs to have &apos;memory&apos; for<br/>processing the sounds the music has visited before getting to &apos;that&apos;<br/>note in order to determine the correct pitch at &apos;that&apos; note. If you<br/>know of such software, please let me know.</p><p>********************************************************************</p><p>&gt;        Does your research involve investigations into seyir?  I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;always found that a fascinating approach to structuring melody and<br/>&gt;improvisation, but there&apos;s so little material about it in English.<br/>&gt;</p><p>*****************************************************************</p><p>You hit it right on the head again, Thank you. We must be in tune<br/>on the structures of Turkish music. The issue of &apos;seyir&apos;, roughly<br/>the &apos;sequential order of sounds used during the course of an<br/>improvisation&apos;, is taking up just about all my time right now. I<br/>do not know of any mathematical model, or something close to it,<br/>published in English or in Turkish. Currently I am grappling with<br/>this fascinating problem with the hope of constructing a plausible<br/>mathematical characterization that will sort out uncountably many<br/>admissible paths from another set of uncountably in-admissble paths<br/>for each of the 120+ maqams in Turkish music. The kind of mathematic<br/>needed for such characterization may yet be non-existent!</p><p>******************************************************************</p><p>&gt;        Hmm... it just occured to me: an investigation the seyir<br/>&gt;phenomenon wrt to Sethares&apos;s research might be interesting, too, but I<br/>&gt;need to think about that some more...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--<br/>&gt;William S.
