Presumably this is a newer practice by<br/>&gt;  tuners, I guess... ??<br/>&gt;  J. Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Wally writes:<br/>&gt;it&apos;s not that new. piano tuners are taught to tune octaves by<br/>&gt; aligning certain pairs of partials, ranging from &quot;2:1&quot; in the high<br/>&gt; register all the way to &quot;10:5&quot; or even &quot;12:6&quot; in the lowest register.<br/>&gt; it&apos;s easy if you know which pitch to listen for beating partials at.</p><p>Greetings,<br/>   Interesting how octaves are regarded.  Some people claim &quot;pure&quot; octaves,<br/>others claim stretched.<br/>   On a piano, there is no such thing as a pure octave.  Piano octaves can<br/>only align one set of coincident partials at a time. If you have the first<br/>partial exactly like the upper notes fundamental, you have a pure 2:1 octave, but<br/>there will be beating higher up.  Due to inharmonicity, the wider the octave,<br/>the higher the Just common partials.<br/>   A  6:3 octave is too wide for the temperament area, it would produce an<br/>objectionable beating in the middle of the piano, (as well as some pretty fast<br/>ET thirds), but it would be a logical result near the top of a piano that had<br/>the bearings laid in the middle with a slightly expanded 2:1 (but not quite a<br/>4:2) octave. That amount of beginning stretch will often allow a fine sounding<br/>temperament, though for concerto work, a slightly wider beginning allows a lot<br/>of aggressive brilliance in the top of the instrument, (really sharp last<br/>octave)<br/>   Tight bass octaves for country sessions,(which keeps the Korg equipped<br/>bass player happy), tends to create some low-end beating with double octaves, but<br/>if they are kept to under 1 bps, don&apos;t call attention to themselves.   Wider<br/>octaves for live rock and roll, as well as jazz allow the higher partials from<br/>the low bass to align with the fundamentals of the middle range and gives a<br/>greater resonance. It should go  without saying, that different pianos require<br/>different rates of expansion.<br/>      If you have a series of 2:1 octaves, you quickly find that your triple<br/>or double octaves begin to sound really flat.  If you have tuned so that your<br/>double octave is perfectly Just, your single octave is definitely stretched,<br/>etc. If you allow the fifths to determine the rate, and you tune pure fifths<br/>from the 5th octave upwards, you will be seeing perhaps 8:4 octaves near the<br/>top.  That gives a pretty stimulative tuning which will cut through with a trio<br/>in a loud bar, but is a little tense for general usage.<br/>    So, there is no really &quot;pure&quot; octave, unless one qualifies it by saying<br/>&quot;pure&quot; at what partial.  The near simplest interval can be as complex as any of<br/>them!  And the unison....... it&apos;s more complex than almost any.</p><p>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a>&quot;&gt;<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>: Six Degrees of Tonality&lt;/A&gt;</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2003 8:23:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, a440a@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/44102">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/44102</a></p><p>&gt;    A  6:3 octave is too wide for the temperament area, it would<br/>produce an objectionable beating in the middle of the piano, (as well<br/>as some pretty fast ET thirds), but it would be a logical result near<br/>the top of a piano that had the bearings laid in the middle with a<br/>slightly expanded 2:1 (but not quite a 4:2) octave.</p><p>***Hello Ed, and others.

It seems like that&apos;s what your saying...</p><p>  Yes.  Tuners think in terms of what partials are actually being tuned Just.<br/>The higher they are, the wider the octave. &quot;Stretch&quot; is the cumulative<br/>sharpening that results. Since the widening of the octave becomes progressively more<br/>pronounced as you reach the ends of the piano&apos;s span, we think more in terms<br/>of how stretched the tuning is rather than how stretched any one octave is<br/>going to be.</p><p>&gt;Why aren&apos;t those lined up exactly with the octave harmonics below??</p><p>   Inharmonicity!  The partials of a vibrating, struck, string are not exact<br/>multiples of the fundamental, they are all sharp, and progressively so. The<br/>higher the partials being tuned to pure coincidence, the farther apart the<br/>fundamentals become.<br/>    Considering a single octave, if the 2nd partial of the lower note and the<br/>fundamental of the upper note are exactly just,(a 2:1 octave) the 6th partial<br/>of the lower note will be sharper than the 3rd partial of the upper note.  If<br/>you widen the octave, it begins to agree at the 6:3 but the 2:1 relationship<br/>begins to beat.<br/>    Notes that are two octaves apart require that the upper note&apos;s<br/>fundamental be aligned with the lower notes&apos;s 4th partial.  That partial will be more<br/>than four times the fundamental, thus if the double octave is  pure, the two<br/>singles in between are both slightly wide.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a><br/> &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/399/six_degrees_of_tonality.html</a>&quot;&gt;<br/><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>: Six Degrees of Tonality&lt;/A&gt;</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/4/2003 5:03:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>For interest on Werckmeister and hearing beats in tuning octave, this is from<br/>&quot;Short Lesson and Addition, how one can tune and temper well a clavier,&quot;<br/>translated by Ellen Jane Archambault.</p><p>&quot;Since one consonance stands against another a little too high or too low,<br/>one calls it a vibration.

The pattern of relationships between the chosen<br/>12-tone tuning and the harmonics on the organ create a complex web of<br/>relationships in a perhaps more &quot;fussy&quot; way on the organ than on the piano<br/>(because of the prominence of the beats in the long-sustained notes).
