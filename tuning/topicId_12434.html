He phoned me yesterday about it, but I<br/>find I can discuss such an issue better in print than on the<br/>telephone...</p><p>Essentially, Johnny likes the &quot;multiplicity&quot; of using quarter-tones as<br/>basic landmarks, but then being able to use WHATEVER cents value he<br/>wants to afterward, whether it &quot;duplicates&quot; another pitch indication<br/>from a closer quarter-tone landmark or not.</p><p>The idea is to be able to retain certain features of &quot;total&quot; music in<br/>Johnny&apos;s view... ie. -31 for the 7/4 ratio and other features which he<br/>feels are paramount...</p><p>Does this seem reasonable to other people??</p><p>My own initial contention is that it is better to have a system where<br/>ONLY ONE pitch can possibly be indicated by ONE notation... i.e. the<br/>&quot;quartertone +/- &lt;26&quot; notation that Joe Monzo has been discussing...</p><p>It seems this specificity is preferable to the &quot;emotional&quot; tonal or<br/>historic associations that might be preserved in the &quot;flexible&quot;<br/>method...</p><p>Johnny cites, in his defense, the system of &quot;enharmonics&quot; in 12-tET<br/>music... ie. A#/Gb whatever.  However, personally, I feel the<br/>enharmonics are DEFICIENCIES in the system... dynosaurs left over from<br/>a period where each designation ACTUALLY MEANT a different pitch.</p><p>This fact, by the way, was NEVER taught in music schools... no matter<br/>how long a person stayed in them...</p><p>Comments?? Is this just a matter of personality, or is there a clear<br/>superiority of one method or another?  This might be good to clear up<br/>before we make a &quot;definitive&quot; post of this notation or kinds of<br/>notation to Joe Monzo&apos;s dictionary.</p><p>By the way... it might be possible to include MORE THAN ONE<br/>alternative in this vein in the dictionary... thereby accomodating<br/>some of Johnny&apos;s concerns to a degree (??)</p><p>I&apos;m hoping we can continue this discussion free of rancor, and in a<br/>pleasant manner with civility and humor!  This is not a war to be<br/>won... just a little tuning definition!<br/>________ ____ ___ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=12540 href="#12540">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2000 7:48:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12516">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12516</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Essentially, Johnny likes the &quot;multiplicity&quot; of using<br/>&gt; quarter-tones as basic landmarks, but then being able to use<br/>&gt; WHATEVER cents value he wants to afterward, whether it<br/>&gt; &quot;duplicates&quot; another pitch indication from a closer<br/>&gt; quarter-tone landmark or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea is to be able to retain certain features of &quot;total&quot;<br/>&gt; music in Johnny&apos;s view... ie. -31 for the 7/4 ratio and other<br/>&gt; features which he feels are paramount...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does this seem reasonable to other people??</p><p>Joe, I&apos;ve just mailed to you Dan Stearns&apos;s copy of the Joe<br/>Maneri &amp; Scott Van Duyne book _Preliminary Studies in the<br/>Virtual Pitch Continuum_, which could just as aptly be titled<br/>&apos;Ear Training in 72-EDO&apos; or &apos;-tET&apos;.  (Thanks for the long loan,<br/>Dan!)</p><p>Along with it, I sent a very &apos;arachnophilic&apos; package: the<br/>program notes, score, and my sketches for _A Noiseless Patient<br/>Spider_.</p><p>In comparing my sketches with the score, you&apos;ll see that the<br/>important &apos;flinging&apos; motive (associated with the spider&apos;s flinging<br/>its thread out of its body and into space) is a series of<br/>tetrads which start with a Pythagorean &apos;major 6th&apos; and hold<br/>the bottom note and top two intervals constant (32/27 and 9/8)<br/>while the lowest interval keeps getting more and more narrow,<br/>so that all three of the upper notes keep descending, until<br/>ending on a Pythagorean &apos;dominant 7th, first inversion&apos; chord.<br/>(This is a precise description of its first appearance, anyway...<br/>it gets varied a lot as the piece progresses...)</p><p>The motive passes thru a variety of 5-, 7-, and 11-limit tetrads<br/>on the way.  If I were to notate all of them *strictly* according<br/>to 144-tET principles, sometimes all three upper notes would<br/>have exactly the same accidentals, and sometimes two of them<br/>would be the same but one would be different.</p><p>But as I noted above, the interval *structure* of the upper<br/>three notes never changes.  So I thought it would be better to<br/>notate it so that the upper three notes *always* have the same<br/>accidentals.</p><p>This is precisely the &apos;consistency&apos; issue brought up by Paul<br/>Erlich, and precisely why he prefers 72-tET over 144-tET.</p><p>My point in bringing this up on the List is just to show everyone<br/>that even tho I&apos;ve argued against both Paul and Johnny on this<br/>issue, I fudge the precision of my own notation when I feel it&apos;s<br/>appropriate, which brings me somewhat into agreement with both of<br/>them, especially Johnny in this particular case, because I *did*<br/>still retain the use of 144-tET (contra Paul) because of the very<br/>small size of many of the melodic intervals in my piece.</p><p>72-tET, which I *do* prefer on general principles, just didn&apos;t<br/>suffice in this case, because the gaps between degrees are<br/>too big to adequately represent what I wrote.</p><p>So I do understand exactly the points being made by both Johnny<br/>and Paul.  But at the same time, in general, I do agree with<br/>you (Joe P.) that notational efficiency is a good thing.</p><p>So, there&apos;s my stance: contradictory, inconclusive, ...<br/>but it works for me, which I suppose is the &apos;bottom line&apos;<br/>on notation.  You use what works.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
