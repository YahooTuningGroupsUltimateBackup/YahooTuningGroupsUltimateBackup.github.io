All the rings have divisions that relate to the golden ratio one way or another.  If<br/>phi is taken to be 0.618... [that is, (sqrt(5)-1)/2] then rings have L:s variously of 1+phi, 2+phi,<br/>3+phi, 2-phi, etc.  Some horagrams have rings with even more complicated relationships to phi.  Not all<br/>rings that take their &quot;L&quot; from the previous ring&apos;s &quot;s&quot; have L:s = 1+phi.</p><p>It appears that it always converges to 1+phi and stays there, at some point.

I&apos;m not at all inclined to rip it out of his hands.  At all.  All I want to do is<br/>discover their musical usefulness for myself, and share my discoveries with others.  Naturally, then,<br/>I&apos;m very eager to learn any and all terminology that Erv uses in conjunction with his horagrams.  If<br/>he&apos;s willing to tell us, that would be wonderful.  I got the idea he was reluctant to divulge any<br/>further details, which is why I didn&apos;t ask you directly to ask him. I was hoping that someone out there<br/>knew what he called it, or else knew what that sort of thing would customarily be called in mathematics.</p><p>Thank you for asking him for us, Kraig!  While you&apos;re at it, do you think you could get him to give you<br/>a glossary of horagram related terms?  That way you won&apos;t have to bug him personally every time we have<br/>a new question, right?</p><p>&gt; Those layers where the s remains s (very inner<br/>&gt; rings) are those points where the ratio has not converged to gold. You can also tell this in that<br/>&gt; Erv moves the numbers to the right hand side when they do.

The two are<br/>independent of each other, although apparently they both always occur in the outer rings (the ones<br/>beginning with the *second* ring numbered on the right in the horagrams drawn by Erv, seemingly).</p><p>Look at #5, for example. 1-2-3-4-5-9-14-19-33-52-85-137.  For rings 5 and 9, &quot;L&quot; equals the previous<br/>ring&apos;s &quot;s&quot; (but their L:s = 2-phi and 2+phi, respectively).  But ring 14 shares the &quot;s&quot; with ring 9.<br/>Rings 19 and on out are golden in both senses.</p><p>Horagram #8.  1-2-3-4-5-9-13-17-30-47-77-124.  Ring 5 (3+phi) gets its &quot;L&quot; from the previous ring&apos;s<br/>&quot;s.&quot;  9 and 13 do not - even though 13 is golden in the sense of L:s = 1+phi.  17 on out appear to be<br/>golden in both senses, at a glance.</p><p>It&apos;s not quite as pretty and clear cut as you might expect.  But as you said, there&apos;s where you often<br/>find the most musically interesting possibilities.  It&apos;s easy enough to make a table column for each<br/>ring that shows its L:s ratio in term of phi.  What I need is a term simply for the property &quot;L&quot; = the<br/>previous ring&apos;s &quot;s&quot; - regardless of the L:s of the ring in question.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Erlich&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This is related to the continued fraction representation of noble numbers<br/>&gt; and of phi (something you should read up on -- see Manfred Schroeder&apos;s<br/>&gt; _Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws_ for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any ratio can be written uniquely as a continued fraction:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a + 1/(b + 1/(c + 1/(d + . . . )))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where a, b, c, d are whole numbers. Now<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Phi = 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/ . . . ))))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So any noble number can be written as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a + 1/(b + 1/(c + 1/(d + . . . /(z + phi)) . . . )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; since all their continued fractions representations end in all 1&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, the ratio you posted,<br/>&gt; (8phi+3)/(21phi+8),<br/>&gt; can be written as<br/>&gt; 1/(2 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + phi))))).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Every time you make a &quot;rabbit hop&quot; move in expanding though the rings of the<br/>&gt; horagrams, the ratio L:s drops off the first piece of its continued fraction<br/>&gt; representation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So the first ring, obviously, has s:L equal to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/(2 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + phi))))).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The next rabbit hop move takes you to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + phi)))).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and the next takes you to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 +  phi))).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which you might observe is equal to the 1+(1/(2-phi)) value you posted.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
