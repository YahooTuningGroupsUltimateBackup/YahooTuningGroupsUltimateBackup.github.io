We&apos;ve had this problem before.<br/>&gt; Hopefully the owner can just remove &quot;mnt99&quot; from the list of recipients and<br/>&gt; we&apos;ll be all set.</p><p>I noticed the &quot;mnt99 doesn&apos;t live here&quot; in the returned email. I looked for<br/>it in my &quot;sent mail&quot; copy but couldn&apos;t locate it.</p><p>My practice has been to highlight the portion of the Digest and hit &quot;Reply.&quot;<br/>The address is automatically inserted in the new window.</p><p>Since I now know that it is a &quot;false alarm&quot; I&apos;ll simply ignore it if it<br/>happens again.</p><p>Thanks, Paul,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
