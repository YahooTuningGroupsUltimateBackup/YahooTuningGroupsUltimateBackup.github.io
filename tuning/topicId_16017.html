I have a feeling I&apos;m going to have to get one of those.</p><p>It is called salgflojt in Swedish, I&apos;ve seen it spelled various ways. It&apos;s<br/>often listed on albums as the willow flute, or overtone flute.</p><p>&gt;&gt; you end up with<br/>&gt;&gt; a full octave (plus a few notes lower) of the lydian dominant<br/>&gt; overtone<br/>&gt;&gt; scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s lydian dominant?  Does that mean it has a raised fourth degree<br/>&gt; but a lowered seventh degree?  I&apos;d be very interested to see it<br/>&gt; spelled out as ratios, if you happen to know.  Otherwise, note names<br/>&gt; will be close enough for now.  And if you know how far up the series<br/>&gt; it can be overblown, that would be helpful.</p><p>Yes, raised fourth, lowered seventh. Easily playable range is harmonics<br/>6-14, a good player can get up to around 17 or 18, it&apos;s very loud up high.<br/>I&apos;m still working on playing 13-14 consistently.</p><p>Basically the scale is 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 45/32 (I&apos;m guessing this one, could be<br/>a 7/5), 3/2, 5/3, 9/5. I have flutes piched in D and F, these are Swedish<br/>synthetic made, available from Lark in the Morning for around $25 each. I<br/>also have a Chieftain (the same people who make the low D whistles) in G, it<br/>has the pennywhistle style mouthpiece, I find it painful to play indoors,<br/>it&apos;s really loud, I&apos;d consider selling it. Lark also sells some wooden hand<br/>made ones that are over $100, I haven&apos;t tried any of these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A similar instrument, but end blown, is used in eastern European<br/>&gt; music such<br/>&gt;&gt; as Hungarian, Rumanian, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where could a fellow find one of these for sale (without traveling to<br/>&gt; Rumania)?  End blown is more my style.  Any web links to info on<br/>&gt; either of these?  Thanks.</p><p>I have not been able to find one of these for sale anywhere, I think you<br/>have to make them yourself, I&apos;ll keep you posted if I find a source,<br/>website, plans, etc. I really want to play one of them, as my ethnic<br/>background is from that region.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p></div>
