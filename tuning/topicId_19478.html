Beyond the pleasure and range of<br/>his work [to say nothing of the way he rearranged the musical<br/>terrain he homesteaded on], you&apos;ve gotta stop to contemplate the<br/>gift of his musical openness; he&apos;s the man who gave us &quot;Blind<br/>Joe Death&quot; *and* &quot;Womblife.&quot; RIP, John.</p><p>&quot;Silence invaded the suburbs,<br/> The current of his feeling failed: he became his admirers.&quot;<br/>- -W.H.

Not only was John Fahey a<br/>wonderful human to have had with us, but it was a great surprise to<br/>see Gregory Taylor&apos;s name again. He was a member of this tuning list<br/>in the old Mills College days, and never was there a pair of ears<br/>more open, fingers-for-typing more eloquent.</p><p>I miss them both, in different ways...</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div>
