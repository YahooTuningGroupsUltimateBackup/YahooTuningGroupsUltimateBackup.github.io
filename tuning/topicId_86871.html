And a few of the possible exact &quot;roots&quot; by that definition include 2,3,9,14,16, and 18.  Then again...I&apos;m guessing you may well mean something different by &quot;root&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;scales that can be considered as being made of relatively low-limit harmonic/subharmoni c series segments. Now, can you show me the stable chords and bass tones in the A scale? &quot;<br/>    Depends how low-limit you think is necessary.  I&apos;d have to think how it translates to multiple octaves but, at least within the octave, some of the simple chords include 1/1 10/9 4/3 and 17/14, 3/2, 13/7.<br/>Note how 17/14 nears 11/9 and 27/16 nears 5/3 so you can get 10/9, 17/14(acting as 11/9),4/3, 27/16 (acting as 5/3).</p><p>    The odd thing is &gt;why&lt; scale A seems to match anywhere from as you said &quot;OK&quot; to fairly well.</p><p>   If you are looking for a lot of straight harmonic series that are well approximated by scale A in a more obvious form, look at scale B<br/>18:20:22:24: 27:30:33: 36 (40)(44)(48)(54)(60)(66)(72)</p><p>Here you can get 18:24:30  = 3:4:5, 20:24:36 = 5:6:9, 24:30:36 = 4:5:6,  27:36:54 = 3:4:6....and tons more if you allow up to 11-limit.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>     However....I think I do see your point in that &quot;chords&quot; like 27:36:44 don&apos;t quite match up across octaves (in that case 27:36:45 would be significantly clearer).<br/>Any ideas how to remedy that?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Actually there are many JI intervals it approximates with varying success, for example 6:11, 6:7, 5:6, 12:17, 3:5...&quot;<br/>    Right, but those all have very different denominators and least common multiples...at least by my research, there&apos;s no distinct JI pattern I can see in them.   Almost any ratio can be approximated by even a fairly strict JI fraction within 15 cents or so.  Actually, once I tried to &quot;round&quot; the Silver Scale to the x/12 harmonic series and found it simply sounded different rather than more consonant or better.  It would be amusing to see, for example, if you could manage to convert the reduced &quot;Silver&quot; scale into a JI version and see how it turns out.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=86895 href="#86895">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2010 11:52:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;And there is a range of thirds that all sound like some kind of major or minor third to me. &quot;<br/>    Right, which is a side effect of the scale&apos;s merging toward 7TET.  It revolves near the same 4 partials of the same parts of the harmonic series repeated around the 3/2 interval.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Now, can you show me the stable chords and bass tones in the A scale? &quot;</p><p>     A side note...I&apos;m releasing a song based on the scale in A) for a competition.  The song, I believe, should break some ground in proving the polyphonic power of the scale.  And yes, the song uses &quot;bass lines&quot;...in fact all of the parts to it span at least 3 octaves and are chalk full of droning and highly consonant 6 and 7 note chords.   It was done by ear and I haven&apos;t had time to find a &quot;proper&quot; music theory for it (since the way chords work in it obviously differ from standard diatonic)...but be on the lookout for the song soon.  You might want to try composing with the scale a bit rather than just comparing intervals...I&apos;ve actually found writing harmony in it easier than in 12TET now that I&apos;ve become used to it.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
