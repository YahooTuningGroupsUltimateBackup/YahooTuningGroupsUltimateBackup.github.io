Its immediate implication is that anyone who<br/>doesn&apos;t agree to Reinhard&apos;s interpretation is &quot;unimaginative&quot;:  Am I<br/>the only one out there that has trouble imagining Mr. Ives agreeing to<br/>such an authoritarian posture?</p><p>That was a title I used when I first gave a large quote from the<br/>_MEMOS_ (TD 359.23). And it was taken from a bit in that very quote:</p><p>&quot;and [even] on the piano the player sees that and feels that, it goes<br/>into the general spirit of the music--though on the piano this is<br/>missed by the unimaginative.&quot;</p><p>I had used it as that was the bit I was had first posted about (as a<br/>half-remembrance from reading the _MEMOS_ many years ago) when this<br/>thread began... My apologies for any unintentional confusion this may<br/>have caused.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
