I personally have always thought that there might be some<br/>very fascinating &quot;colorless&quot; pseudo-tonal heirarchies possible,<br/>especially when the overtones of the timbres used are detuned to match<br/>the scale in question. I&apos;m not sure what sort of overtones such a<br/>timbre would have or if it would have to be tied into your<br/>&quot;proportional beating&quot; theory or what not, but the concept somehow<br/>entered into my mind a while ago and I thought it seemed promising.</p><p>Nonetheless, I don&apos;t think that people here have any fundamental<br/>problem with your phi scale. I think that you haven&apos;t really<br/>adequately explained it, as a lot of people have been saying. The<br/>explanations you have offered sometimes don&apos;t make sense with the<br/>terminology that you use and in the context that people are used to<br/>hearing them. If your goal is for everyone to understand your idea, it<br/>is your job to facilitate the process.</p><p>Nonetheless, I encourage you to keep going with this idea, as it seems<br/>promising, although I don&apos;t know that the specific explanation and<br/>theory you have is precisely what is going on. Keep thinking though.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
