I have been considering the following arrangement which<br/>&gt;when combined together creates a kind of matrix guitar.  Please let me know<br/>&gt;what you think, as I have not yet fully thought it through.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Darren&apos;s plan for a dual guitar looks very interesting. Tuning systems<br/>&gt;which emphasize series of partials are guarenteed to reflect the spectrum<br/>&gt;of a vibrating string. A double necked JI guitar, now there&apos;s an idea!</p><p>I built an electric slide version of this instrument.  It has two sides.<br/>One has strings tuned to harmonics 8-16, and the other has two sets of<br/>strings, one tuned to a harmonic hexad, and the other to a subharmonic<br/>hexad.  Both sides of the body are marked to indicate harmonics 8-16 and<br/>subharmonics 6-12.  Darren, if you have played Denny&apos;s Cosmolyra you are<br/>familiar with this layout.</p><p>The instrument is extremely resourceful, even as a solo instrument, for<br/>anyone who has paid their fingerpicking and slide technique dues.  John<br/>Starrett played the @#$% out of it, if only briefly and unplugged, about a<br/>year ago now.  Rod Poole has also played it, briefly and unplugged, to good<br/>effect.</p><p>To play it in a band situation is much easier, and almost anybody could<br/>pick it up in an hour or so.</p><p>But the design does have drawbacks.  I can&apos;t imagine, even with a fretted<br/>version, gettin voice leading from inverting chords the way you do on a<br/>regular guitar.  But I&apos;m not a guitarist, so I don&apos;t really know...</p><p>Carl</p></div>
