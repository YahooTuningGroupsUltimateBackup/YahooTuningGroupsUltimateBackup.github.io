If 171 works, why shouldn&apos;t 612? If my second &quot;JI&quot; version works, why not the real JI version?</p><p>(2) Allow Scala operations (such as rendering a sequence to midi) without first loading a scale and then not using it for anything.</p><p>(3) Fix the menu windows so that they don&apos;t slide away when you try to click on an item in the top part of a long list.</p><p>(4) Allow rendering of .seq files with note values in cents; it seems kind of silly to convert these to rational numbers, which is what I do.</p><p>(5) Allow for more kinds of &quot;find chord&quot; operations; in particular, finding all n-limit chords to various limits.</p><p>(6) Fixing the clavier so it doesn&apos;t make funny percussion sounds instead of notes sometimes.</p></div><h3><a id=38346 href="#38346">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>7/1/2002 1:26:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ach, I wished you asked earlier instead of trying so hard...</p><p>&gt;(1) Push Scala .seq file rendering to the edge of what midi can<br/>accomodate.

You can make it as large as you<br/>wish<br/>by editing the file params.par. For the rest, the limitations are in midi,<br/>not Scala.</p><p>&gt;(2) Allow Scala operations (such as rendering a sequence to midi) without<br/>first loading a scale and &gt;then not using it for anything.</p><p>I don&apos;t know of other operations that don&apos;t. But you can also put the<br/>scale loading statement in the .seq file.</p><p>&gt;(3) Fix the menu windows so that they don&apos;t slide away when you try to<br/>click on an item in the top &gt;part of a long list.</p><p>This is a problem in the Windows port of Gtk. I hope the next version of<br/>Gtk will solve this. It&apos;s not something I want to be involved in.</p><p>&gt;(4) Allow rendering of .seq files with note values in cents; it seems<br/>kind of silly to convert these &gt;to rational numbers, which is what I do.</p><p>It is :) You can use cents! I also noticed very large rationals in your<br/>file,<br/>but the numerator and denominator can&apos;t be bigger than 2^31-1.</p><p>&gt;(5) Allow for more kinds of &quot;find chord&quot; operations; in particular,<br/>finding all n-limit chords to &gt;various limits.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s a useful wish.</p><p>&gt;(6) Fixing the clavier so it doesn&apos;t make funny percussion sounds instead<br/>of notes sometimes.</p><p>That&apos;s because you haven&apos;t told it to not use the percussion channel 10.<br/>If you put the line &quot;set exclude 10&quot; in startup.cmd this won&apos;t happen.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=38347 href="#38347">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2002 2:37:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., manuel.op.de.coul@e... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ach, I wished you asked earlier instead of trying so hard...</p><p>I deeply appeciate Scala and so was a bit reluctent to pick nits.</p><p>&gt; &gt;(4) Allow rendering of .seq files with note values in cents; it seems<br/>&gt; kind of silly to convert these &gt;to rational numbers, which is what I do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is :) You can use cents!</p><p>How do you make that work?</p><p>&gt; &gt;(6) Fixing the clavier so it doesn&apos;t make funny percussion sounds instead<br/>&gt; of notes sometimes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s because you haven&apos;t told it to not use the percussion channel 10.<br/>&gt; If you put the line &quot;set exclude 10&quot; in startup.cmd this won&apos;t happen.</p><p>&quot;set exclude 10&quot; seems to be the default, and hence has been in my startup file all along, but even so 10 does not seem to be exluded.</p></div><h3><a id=38348 href="#38348">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>7/1/2002 2:49:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;How do you make that work?</p><p>If there&apos;s a period in the number, it&apos;s read as cents, so<br/>like this</p><p>0 note (116.6) 100</p><p>You&apos;re aware that using literal values in a .seq file<br/>makes it harder to change the tuning, so using scale<br/>degree numbers or note names instead is recommended.</p><p>&gt;&quot;set exclude 10&quot; seems to be the default, and hence has been in my<br/>startup file all along, but even so &gt;10 does not seem to be exluded.</p><p>Do you have a Soundblaster card?
