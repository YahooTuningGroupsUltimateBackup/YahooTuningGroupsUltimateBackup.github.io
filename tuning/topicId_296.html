I started in the mid-80&apos;s, experimenting with 19-tet and 1/4-comma<br/>meantone. (Here&apos;s a bit of trivia: when I wrote the AdLib sound drivers for<br/>the games Ultima VI and the PC version of Times of Lore, I set the tuning<br/>tables to play in 1/6-comma meantone, with up to seven sharps or flats.)<br/>Although I haven&apos;t written much music in the last 10 years, I&apos;ve recently<br/>started writing again, and some of the more interesting results are up on<br/>my web page (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>).</p><p>I&apos;ve been exploring different equal scales (in particular 15- and 22-tet),<br/>different kinds of well-tempered tuning, and just intonation, but I didn&apos;t<br/>even consider exploring some of the more exotic equal tunings such as 16-<br/>and 20-tet until I heard Easley Blackwood&apos;s CD of microtonal etudes in all<br/>the equal tunings from 13 to 24. I did try 13-tet once just to see if it<br/>was really as bad as Wendy Carlos hinted on _Secrets of Synthesis_, and it<br/>turned out to be not quite that bad if you can manage to avoid the<br/>dissonant fifths. But now I&apos;m interested in exploring all of these scales<br/>for their exotic musical properties, at least up to 31-tet, although 41-tet<br/>also looks nice, and even 37-tet looks somewhat interesting. So far, I&apos;ve<br/>written brief &quot;experiments&quot; in 16-tet and 26-tet (on my web page as MIDI<br/>files), and I&apos;m in the middle of writing one in 20-tet.</p><p>The one problem I&apos;ve been having is that I can&apos;t figure out how to notate<br/>all these exotic scales in a way that makes sense musically. The meantone<br/>scales (12, 19, 26, 31, 38, 43, ...) are easy enough. The scales that<br/>resemble just intonation in having two different sizes of whole steps (15,<br/>22, 27, 29, 34, 39, 41, ...) are a little more complicated, but only an<br/>extra pair of accidentals is needed to represent the difference between a<br/>major third and two large whole steps (or four fifths up / two octaves<br/>down).</p><p>But that still leaves quite a few scales that don&apos;t fit easily into one of<br/>these two categories. 17-tet is intermediate between these categories in<br/>some ways, and it isn&apos;t really a meantone scale, although that seems to be<br/>the best way to notate it. 11-tet seems especially hard to notate, although<br/>it&apos;s not as interesting as some of the other tunings. I eventually figured<br/>out that I can notate 16-tet by *adding* a step to the major thirds, rather<br/>than subtracting a step as in 15-tet. It&apos;s bizarre, but it works.</p><p>The scale that I&apos;m especially interested in right now, 20-tet, is resisting<br/>my efforts to notate it. It has a very flat &quot;major&quot; third (the closest<br/>approximation to 5/4), which in conjunction with the very sharp fifth<br/>sounds more like a neutral third than a major one. The next interval in the<br/>scale is a very sharp third, close to 14/11 (33.7 cents sharp of 5/4), and<br/>somewhat dissonant, but to me it sounds more like a major third in the<br/>context of a 0-7-12 triad compared with the &quot;neutral&quot; 0-6-12 triad. I&apos;d<br/>also like to be able to recognize the familiar sounding diminished seventh<br/>chords and the 5-tet pentatonic scale without too much difficulty.</p><p>If you have Real Audio (at least 3.0), you can hear a sample of music using<br/>this scale (about 300K): <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/20test.ra">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/20test.ra</a></p><p>Has anyone come up with a good system of notation for this or other equal<br/>scales?</p></div><h3><a id=306 href="#306">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xx</h3><span>1/13/1999 2:59:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would be curious too which notation Blackwood used for 20-tET, perhaps<br/>Paul Hahn can find it somewhere.<br/>Because four cycles of fifths (with only five notes) are needed to<br/>cover the scale, any notation that uses the seven diatonic names will<br/>be inconsistent. The Pythagorean semitone and whole tone are both 4<br/>steps. A possible approach is to use only the first five names,<br/>starting at F: F-C-G-D-A and not use E and B.

Then use Fokker&apos;s accidentals the semisharp, sesquisharp,<br/>semiflat and sesquiflat for 1, 3, -1 and -3 steps, and the regular<br/>sharp and flat for 2 and -2 steps.

But it&apos;s easier to read and write<br/>&gt; than my current system. I had a similar system for 15-tet:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C C# D D# Eb E F F# Gb G Ab A A# Bb B C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, it&apos;s the G - D, B - F#, and B - D intervals that have unusual<br/>&gt; spellings.

Africa. It is not an equal<br/>scale but is close using higher harmonics. It was formed by just doing simple<br/>modulations until it formed a cycle. The closest scale you would have to this<br/>tuning would occur if you superimposed 7 units of your tuning. You would end<br/>up with  an MOS at 5,7,9,&amp;16. On the keyboard I have for this tuning I have a<br/>conventional keyboard that alternates 3 blacks and 4 blacks instead of 2 and<br/>3. One person remarked that it made them feel like they are seeing double!<br/>I&apos;ve been using F F# Gb G G# Ab A Bb B C C# Db  D D# Eb E. Which has problems<br/>too but thought you might like the MOS subset!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
