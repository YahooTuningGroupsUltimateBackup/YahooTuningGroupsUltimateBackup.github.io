My<br/>&gt;table was one of all the possible rational dyads in lowest terms , ordered<br/>&gt;in terms of d, and then n (thus making it related to but not identical to<br/>&gt;Farey series). Noise is not a dyad. Silence could be a dyad with amplitude<br/>&gt;zero, but that presents an ontological question well beyond my meagre<br/>&gt;talents.</p><p>Gee, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth responding to.  But I did, in a private<br/>e-mail to Dave.  And now I&apos;m doing it again...</p><p>[Lumma]<br/>&gt;Well, I&apos;d as soon you (or anybody) wouldn&apos;t ask, because I don&apos;t see the<br/>&gt;musical application.  But, I can never resist giving out my opinion.  For<br/>&gt;silence, I&apos;d say infinite consonance and zero dissonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For white noise, I&apos;d really have to say consonance and dissonance are not<br/>&gt;defined.  Its dissonance may be rated moderate by subjects, but it is<br/>hardly &gt;a dyad...</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>&gt;Isn&apos;t it the equivalent of playing every note at once? A megatrad? :-)</p><p>[Lumma]<br/>&gt;I was reading Manfred Schroeder&apos;s _Fractals, Chaos, and Power Laws_ a<br/>month &gt;or two ago, and white noise was mentioned.  If I remember correctly,<br/>you can &gt;approximate it with a given number of notes, but real white noise,<br/>for &gt;example, won&apos;t change pitch if you double or triple the speed of the<br/>tape &gt;it&apos;s recorded on...</p></div>
