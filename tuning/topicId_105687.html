The idea is to<br/>approximate a JI division such as 63:81:104 (1/1-9/7-104/63 or<br/>0-435.084-867.792 cents), where two large major thirds averaging<br/>just a tad smaller than 9/7 form a large neutral third at<br/>somewhere around 104/63 or the slightly smaller 33/20 (866.959<br/>cents). This means that the third will average out somewhere<br/>around 433 cents.</p><p>Thus it&apos;s &quot;semineutral&quot; both because each large major third is<br/>equal to exactly or approximately half of the neutral sixth; and<br/>because that sixth is itself &quot;semineutral,&quot; with some submajor<br/>qualities -- almost another kind of major sixth, but more active<br/>than 5/3, as 22/13 or the like is on the other side of the<br/>5-limit.</p><p>In sensi, the large major third is actually the generator of the<br/>whole system. In semineutral, however, the related but less<br/>ambitious goal is to get a fair number of 63:81:104 sonorities<br/>and lots of those near-9/7 major thirds, along with lots of<br/>perfect fifths and fourths, and septimal and neutral intervals<br/>generally.</p><p>In 36-EDO, this plays out as a 17-note MOS with 15 small steps at<br/>66.7 cents (the excellent thirdtone of this system) and 2 large<br/>steps of 100 cents. We get 6 locations for 0-433.3-866.7 cents,<br/>the semineutral sonority itself; 11 locations for 9/7 at 1.751<br/>cents narrow; and 14 locations for 3/2.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/semineutral_36-ED2.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/semineutral_36-ED2.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>! semineutral_36-ED2.scl<br/>!<br/>Semineutral tuning in 36-EDO, 0-433.33-866.67 cents<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 66.66667<br/> 133.33333<br/> 200.00000<br/> 266.66667<br/> 366.66666<br/> 433.33333<br/> 500.00000<br/> 566.66667<br/> 633.33333<br/> 700.00000<br/> 766.66667<br/> 866.66667<br/> 933.33333<br/> 1000.00000<br/> 1066.66667<br/> 1133.33333<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here&apos;s a version in MET-24 with 6 locations for our semineutral<br/>sonority with two large major thirds forming an approximate 33/20<br/>or 104/63 at 866.0 or 867.2 cents, and 11 for near-9/7 major<br/>thirds in a smaller size of 427.7 cents and larger ones of 438.3<br/>or 439.5 cents. However, we have only 13 regular fifths near 3/2,<br/>as opposed to 14 in the 36-EDO version. The set is a Constant<br/>Structure (CS for short), meaning that a given interval is always<br/>formed from the same number of steps -- although not necessarily<br/>vice versa!</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-semineutral17_Fsharp.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-semineutral17_Fsharp.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>! met24-semineutral17_F#.scl<br/>!<br/>17-CS semineutral sixth from two large major thirds (~63:81:104)<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 57.42187<br/> 139.45313<br/> 207.42187<br/> 264.84375<br/> 370.31250<br/> 427.73437<br/> 496.87500<br/> 577.73438<br/> 635.15625<br/> 704.29687<br/> 761.71875<br/> 867.18750<br/> 924.60937<br/> 992.57812<br/> 1074.60937<br/> 1132.03125<br/> 2/1</p><p>The 36-EDO version is an MOS tuning, and ideal for a maximum<br/>number of supraminor and submajor intervals (e.g. thirds at 333.3<br/>and 366.7 cents); the MET-24 version has a greater variety of<br/>neutral intervals, but is a bit less regular.</p><p>Both versions offer, as one attraction in the neutral range,<br/>approximations of Phi (833.090 cents), a point of maximum<br/>complexity or metastability as Dave Keenan and I have sometimes<br/>described it. In the 36-EDO tuning, we get 10 locations at<br/>833.333 cents, virtually identical to Phi; in MET-24, we have<br/>seven locations at 829.688 cents, not too far from Phi and very<br/>close to 21/13 (830.253 cents).</p><p>With many thanks to Mike, and best New Year&apos;s wishes,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105688 href="#105688">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2012 2:17:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Dec 27, 2012 at 4:23 AM, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus it&apos;s &quot;semineutral&quot; both because each large major third is<br/>&gt; equal to exactly or approximately half of the neutral sixth; and<br/>&gt; because that sixth is itself &quot;semineutral,&quot; with some submajor<br/>&gt; qualities -- almost another kind of major sixth, but more active<br/>&gt; than 5/3, as 22/13 or the like is on the other side of the<br/>&gt; 5-limit.</p><p>Hi Margo - I&apos;ve got a half-written reply to your posts that I hope to<br/>send off tomorrow, but while this is here - I note that this seems to<br/>be related to what we&apos;re calling &quot;squares&quot; temperament, where two<br/>9/7&apos;s make up a 13/8 (or maybe an 18/11, depending on the subgroup<br/>temperament). This might be a very nice subgroup version of that.</p><p>I also see you mentioned 33/20, which is a favorite interval of mine<br/>as it appears on the chord 1/1-3/2-5/2-7/2-11/3-11/2-99/16-33/4<br/>between the 33/4 and 5/2 (as 33/10). If you bring the 33/4 down to<br/>33/8 and split the 33/20 in half as you describe in your temperament,<br/>you get a very nice neutral sixth sound, somewhat close to 13/8 but a<br/>bit sharper. I find this chord to be very interesting, as it mixes<br/>together two completely different sounds in my head; the chord I wrote<br/>above has a certain sort of very sultry sound to it, which for no<br/>particular reason I hear as purple (assuming 1/1 is C), whereas the<br/>neutral sixth is suddenly nice and cloudy and gray. It&apos;s like<br/>discovering that sweet and sour go together well, or something...</p><p>You can distill the above chord down to 1/1-5/4-n6-33/16, where n6 is<br/>the neutral sixth directly between 5/4 and 33/16. This makes the 33/16<br/>on the outside sound completely random to my ears, but I can hear it<br/>as &quot;connecting&quot; to the tonic by throwing 11/8 in there as well, making<br/>it 1/1-5/4-11/8-n6-33/16. I would expect that in live performances,<br/>musicians would tend to pitch the n6 down towards 13/8 a bit to<br/>increase the resonance there.</p><p>Making it a bit sharper and bisecting the 33/20 allows you to modulate<br/>in some interesting ways, such as by turning the n6 and 33/16 into the<br/>&quot;7&quot; and &quot;9&quot; of a 4:5:6:7:9 chord, meaning the lowest two notes (e.g.<br/>the 5/4 dyad) drop down by 12/11. I find this to be a very pleasant<br/>chord progression which is, in a mathematical sense, characteristic of<br/>the temperament which you suggest here. You can also just drop the<br/>lowest note and keep the second note as is, which temporarily leads to<br/>the interval between the two lowest notes being 15/11. You can treat<br/>this as a suspension which can then resolve down to a 5/4 above the<br/>new tonic - but, as 15/11 is so close to 11/8, and since this is an<br/>otherwise straightforwardly otonal chord, you might find that the<br/>whole thing has a very resonant sound to it, as though it might not<br/>need to resolve anywhere at all! Tempering out 121/120 makes the<br/>equivalence between 15/11 and 11/8 official.</p><p>I&apos;ll finish responding to your other posts, but in the meantime, as I<br/>noted you said were particularly fascinated more by interesting chord<br/>progressions than a universal theory of music, perhaps you might find<br/>the above to be a good example of the sort of &quot;practical&quot; uses made<br/>possible by this temperament, among (of course) other things.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS to Gene: I still find this temperament easier to make sense of than<br/>Orwell, unfortunately, but thanks for the try on XA :(</p></div><h3><a id=105692 href="#105692">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2012 7:39:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Hi Margo - I&apos;ve got a half-written reply to your posts that I hope<br/>&gt;  to send off tomorrow, but while this is here - I note that this<br/>&gt;  seems to be related to what we&apos;re calling &quot;squares&quot; temperament,<br/>&gt;  where two 9/7&apos;s make up a 13/8 (or maybe an 18/11, depending on the<br/>&gt;  subgroup temperament).

With a<br/>generator of 13\36, we get a 31-MOS with 26 fifths at 700 cents.</p><p>This abstract temperament, whether named &quot;semineutral&quot; or something<br/>else, is distinct in its mapping of 128/3 to 15 generators; compare<br/>squares with a mapping of 8/3 to 4 generators (e.g. 6\17, 24\17), or<br/>sensi with its mapping of 6/1 to 7 generators (e.g. 17\46, 119\46).</p><p>What the TOP or POTE is, I&apos;m not sure, but 13\36 is one obvious<br/>implementation.</p><p>With warmest thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105830 href="#105830">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2013 4:34:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alright, starting to catch up on some old posts I had to let hang...<br/>starting here:</p><p>On Thu, Dec 27, 2012 at 10:39 PM, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi, Mike.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Especially given all you have to deal with for that other reply<br/>&gt; &lt;grin&gt;, I thought I&apos;d just offer a brief comment on the matter of<br/>&gt; sensi and squares, and congratulate you for some incredibly creative<br/>&gt; uses of 33/20 and more in extended chords of a kind quite beyond my<br/>&gt; experience (where four voices is usually &quot;a very rich texture&quot;).</p><p>Thanks; I just really like 33/16, for some reason.. :)</p><p>&gt; This abstract temperament, whether named &quot;semineutral&quot; or something<br/>&gt; else, is distinct in its mapping of 128/3 to 15 generators; compare<br/>&gt; squares with a mapping of 8/3 to 4 generators (e.g. 6\17, 24\17), or<br/>&gt; sensi with its mapping of 6/1 to 7 generators (e.g. 17\46, 119\46).</p><p>So, we can get this <a href="http://2.3.7.11/5">2.3.7.11/5</a> temperament:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=36_277p&limit=2_3_7_11%2F5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=36_277p&limit=2_3_7_11%2F5</a></p><p>Adding 121/120 gives us this really complex 11-limit temperament</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=36ce_61d&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=36ce_61d&limit=11</a></p><p>But I wonder if there&apos;s a simpler way to map 5 and 11.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105832 href="#105832">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2013 1:29:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia  wrote:</p><p>&gt; Adding 121/120 gives us this really complex 11-limit temperament<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=36ce_61d&limit=11">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=36ce_61d&limit=11</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I wonder if there&apos;s a simpler way to map 5 and 11.</p><p>Orwell. :)</p></div>
