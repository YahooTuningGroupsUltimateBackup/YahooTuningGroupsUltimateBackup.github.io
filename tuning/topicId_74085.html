Number V still is an  additional temperament,<br/>subdivided by &frac14; comma.  After this, Number VI is a temperament  which has<br/>nothing to do with the same subdivision of the comma.  However, in practice, it is<br/>so correct  that one can be satisfied with that (about which there shall be<br/>special comments  later).  Now we want to consider  this temperament Number III<br/>which is led though the fourths or quarter comma,  and describe a little how<br/>it is recognized and placed on the monochord, whereby  it should be mentioned<br/>that all the time the tempered pitches fall into place,  where the little<br/>slash is since the degrees have been divided, crossing though  the line; and this<br/>must be considered in all cases.<br/>Andreas Werckmeister Musical Temperament (1691)<br/>This is the only representation of Werckmeister V tuning in the entire<br/>treatise, besides the actual copperplate monochord drawings.<br/>Johnny</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=74087 href="#74087">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2007 11:05:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Number IV is a temperament which is also contained in the<br/>Orgel-Probe and is<br/>&gt; subdivided through  1/3 comma.</p><p>The Orgel-Probe table with the up-down V indications is my source for<br/>WIII and IV (1691 numbering).</p><p>&gt; [Werckmeister] Number V still is an  additional temperament,<br/>&gt; subdivided by &frac14; comma.</p><p>&gt; This is the only representation of Werckmeister V tuning in the entire<br/>&gt; treatise, besides the actual copperplate monochord drawings.</p><p>Right. I admit I haven&apos;t bothered to work out the copperplate<br/>proportions to see which fifths are tempered by 1/4 comma up or down.<br/>In this respect, I simply trusted Lindley&apos;s beehive diagram in<br/>Stimmung und Temperatur.
