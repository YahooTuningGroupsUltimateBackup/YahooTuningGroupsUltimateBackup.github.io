If anything&apos;s still<br/>unclear, post your question to the list.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>First, let&apos;s recall the following exchange, which took place here in March<br/>of this year...</p><p>[Dan Stearns wrote...]<br/>&gt;OK, this makes sense to me as well (and I was indeed thinking along<br/>&gt;these lines in the three 3L &amp; 4s examples I gave as well), but what if<br/>&gt;the intervals in question are something like a 17/12 and a 24/17<br/>&gt;though? Strictly proper but oh so close to not being so... is their<br/>&gt;some agreed upon practical range to draw the line with scales that<br/>&gt;might recognize these tiny commatic differences that would perhaps<br/>&gt;only trivially distinguish them from being strictly proper or just<br/>&gt;proper?</p><p>[Paul Erlich wrote...]<br/>&gt;Dan, much as with consistency, propriety does involve a very sharp &gt;boundary,<br/>and crossing that boundary by a very small amount, while<br/>&gt;possibly having no audible effect, can amount to a change from a<br/>&gt;strictly proper scale to a proper one to an improper one. I was once<br/>&gt;bothered by the fact that the Pythagorean diatonic scale was improper,<br/>&gt;but it turns out that Rothenberg believed that as long as the worst<br/>&gt;impropriety (in this case, a Pythagorean comma) was to small to be<br/>&gt;perceived (since you&apos;re comparing B-f with f-b in this case, it would<br/>&gt;be hard to perceive the difference), the scale is essentially perceived<br/>&gt;as proper. Carl, am I representing Rothenberg correctly here?</p><p>...I&apos;d like now to clarify the response I gave on March 9th, in a message<br/>titled &quot;barely improper&quot; (egroups message #9175).</p><p>First off, yes, Paul, I believe you were representing Rothenberg correctly.<br/>But I think we can go one better than old R here.  With the &quot;show data&quot;<br/>command in Scala 1.6, we see &quot;Lumma stability&quot;, followed by &quot;impropriety<br/>factor&quot;.  What are they?</p><p>Imagine a log-frequency ruler whose total length is the interval of<br/>equivalence (&quot;formal octave&quot;) of our periodic scale.  Take all of the<br/>unique intervals in the scale&apos;s interval matrix and mark them off on the<br/>ruler.  Now, draw line segments on the ruler with colored pencil, using the<br/>marks as endpoints.  Connect all marks belonging to the same scale degree<br/>with a single line, using a different color for each scale degree.  &quot;Lumma<br/>stability&quot; is the portion of the ruler that has no pencil on it -- the<br/>portion of the octave that is not covered by scale degrees.  &quot;Impropriety<br/>factor&quot; is the portion of the ruler that is more than singly covered -- the<br/>part where different colors overlap.  The idea being that when two scale<br/>degrees overlap, the listener will not be able to distinguish them in all<br/>cases -- that&apos;s a loss of propriety.  Lumma stability measures how well-<br/>distinguished the non-overlapping degrees are.</p><p>In my earlier post, I correctly characterize my measure as being a version<br/>of Rothenberg&apos;s, applied to logarithmic pitch space rather than &apos;scale<br/>degree rank space&apos;.  I say that both versions are useful, begging the<br/>questions: &quot;Which is more useful?&quot;, &quot;When is one better than the other?&quot;,<br/>and so on.</p><p>To answer, this paper will contribute &quot;rank standard deviation/range&quot;.<br/>This measure will tell us, for a given scale, how effective &quot;equivalence&quot;<br/>is, and thus how pertinent any of the measures which are &quot;invariants of<br/>equivalence&quot; will be to the given scale.</p><p>What is &quot;equivalence&quot;?  It is the process which converts an interval matrix<br/>into a rank-order matrix.  Which measures are &quot;invariants of equivalence&quot;?<br/>Rothenberg-stability, Efficiency, Constant Structures, are all invariant<br/>under equivalence, since they can be defined on the rank-order matrix<br/>alone.  But Lumma-stability is _not_, since scales which share the same<br/>rank-order matrix may have different Lumma-stability values.  Therefore,<br/>&quot;rank standard deviation&quot; and range will tell us when my version is better,<br/>along with a few other things...</p><p>Rank standard deviation and rank range are designed to measure the<br/>complexity of a scale&apos;s interval matrix.  The higher these values, the more<br/>difficult it will be for the listener to construct the matrix, and the more<br/>likely it will be that he uses a matrix he has already learned instead<br/>(thus hearing the scale in question as a re- or mis-tuning of a scale he<br/>already knows).  The measures are easy to calculate.  Again, we need our<br/>log-frequency ruler, and again, we&apos;ll take all of the unique intervals in<br/>our scale&apos;s interval matrix and mark them off on the ruler.  But this time,<br/>instead of involving scale degrees, we simply find the ratios between all<br/>pairs of consecutive values marked on the ruler.  The measures are then<br/>the standard deviation and the range of the decimal values of these ratios.</p><p>For example, take the major 7th chord in 12-tet.  Its interval matrix:</p><p>0 4 7 11 12<br/>0 3 7  8 12<br/>0 4 5  9 12<br/>0 1 5  8 12</p><p>Unique intervals: 0 1 3 4 5 7 8 9 11 12</p><p>Distances between consecutive marks: 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1</p><p>Range: 1 (this should be expressed as a fraction of the formal octave,<br/>         so: 1/12).</p><p>Standard deviation: Well, you get the idea (any measure of central tendency<br/>should work here).</p><p>The idea is that since the interval matrix works by ranking intervals by<br/>size, the easiest matrices to use will be ones in which the sizes are most<br/>evenly distributed.  Since for periodic scales the intervals between the<br/>intervals (ratios between consecutive marks on the ruler) must sum to the<br/>formal octave, the mean ratio occurs between every pair of marks in the<br/>ideal case, and the standard deviation will be in direct proportion to the<br/>complexity.  Range should work in a similar way, but may differ by a<br/>scaling factor from the standard deviation?  I&apos;m not sure which is more<br/>intuitive.  Perhaps someone with some knowledge of statistics can help me<br/>out here.</p><p>So there you have it.  I should go over the Rothenberg papers again, to<br/>refresh myself on what he says about the tolerance of perception.  My<br/>feeling was, that since he was working with ETs, and especially since he<br/>used a relatively small ET (12-tet) for testing his measures, he didn&apos;t<br/>run into many close calls.  From speaking with him, I got the impression<br/>that he considers equivalence very strong -- scales are gestalts which hold<br/>their character through a great deal of mistuning.  From his point of view,<br/>any instability is undesirable, and scales would be ruled out long before<br/>close calls were an issue.  In other words, Rothenberg is really only<br/>interested in scales for which my rank deviation is very small.</p><p>But I, for one, don&apos;t frown so much on instability, especially if it isn&apos;t bad<br/>in pitch space, and we may arrive at close calls for harmonic reasons.<br/>Rothenberg was interested only in melodic scales -- many of us are interested<br/>in harmony, too, and don&apos;t have the luxury of re-tuning scales until they fit<br/>neatly into a rank order matrix.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
