Others chords will be deduce of<br/>the context in which they are, in particular diminished 7th chords and<br/>secondary 7th chords. Obviously, the validity of this analysis depends<br/>on the one of the postulates.</p><p>### Chords without problems</p><p>&#x9;The first measure is to strings only (with organ), it presents notes of<br/>the chord of D major, first violins ends it with an E (passing note).<br/>First violin&apos;s melody is like 8-6-8-9 (D-A-D-E), 2d violin&apos;s melody is<br/>4-5 (A-C#), viola&apos;s is 5-6 (F#-A), cellos made tonic &quot;4&quot;.<br/>If we want to reduce to the same denominator, we must start with sound 8<br/>(cellos) because of the leading-note which is a 15 compare to the tonic,<br/>which results :</p><p>* example 1 (first bar)</p><p>16   12   16   18   =   D   A   D   E</p><p>12_____________15   =   A___________C#</p><p>10_____________12   =   F#__________A</p><p>8________________   =   D____________</p><p>In the same way, 3d measure (for the choir) may be analysed like this :</p><p>* example 2 (3d bar)</p><p>6________8___5___   =   A________D___F#____</p><p>5________5_______   =   F#_______F#________</p><p>3________3_______   =   A________A_________</p><p>2________2_______   =   D________D_________</p><p>&#x9;All the measures which allowed only a major chord more or less spread<br/>can be numbered like this (bars 1, 3, 7, 18, 21, 22, 30, 37, 43 and 46).<br/>&#x9;Second bar contains a G and an E passing notes, which will oblige us to<br/>choose between 3 possibilities:</p><p>- Either we consider them like a part of a dominant chord, and, if we<br/>allow number 7, E-G is equal to 6-7, thus a &quot;false&quot; 4th 21/16 between D<br/>abd G.<br/>- Or we prefer to keep the real 4th 4/3, minor 3d becoming pythagorus<br/>(32/27).<br/>- Or we want that E-G remain simple and conventional (6/5), which<br/>involve either a false 4th D-G (27/20), or a false 5th A-E (40/27).<br/>&#x9;The first solution appear (to me...) more coherent.</p><p>### Dominant chords without problems</p><p>&#x9;We&apos;ll consider as this dominant chords which the 7th major may be<br/>number 7 (usually call 7th overtone) without conflict with an identical<br/>note (on the score and with ET12), in particularly if this note is a<br/>sub-dominant chord. It won&apos;t proove that 7 is the best solution, but<br/>o,ly that&apos;s not impossible.<br/>The 5th bar is in this case, and furthermore it&apos;s a major (dominant)<br/>ninth chord. With numbering only soprano part, we have:<br/>G-B-A-G = 7-9-8-7.<br/>&#x9;If we want to number all the measure with whome-numbers (except F#,<br/>passing note, because it will still be more complicated), we obtain:</p><p>* example 3 (5th bar)</p><p>14   18   16   14   =   G   B   A   G</p><p>12   14 (40/3) 12   =   E   G (F#)  E</p><p>8_________8______   =   A_______A______</p><p>5_________5______   =   C#______C#_____</p><p>Measures 8, 13, 24 and 38 can be analysed by the same way.</p><p>### Avoided complicated relations with the tonic</p><p>&#x9;A suspension of the tonic on the third of a dominant chord involve a<br/>false 5th 32/21 (bigger than 3/2) between this tonic and the 7th of the<br/>dominant chord (always if we admit number 7 as the 7th of dominant<br/>chords). Mozart avoid this 3 times. For example at 17th bar, there is a<br/>7th dominant chord in A major, the sopranos sing an A for two<br/>quarter-notes [crochets], the 7th happend only on the 3d quarter-note<br/>and, at the same moment, the A is resolved on a G#. We have the same<br/>proceeding bars 20 and 29. On the other hand, at the last but one bar<br/>(45), the friction between the 7th G and the tonic D isn&apos;t avoid,<br/>moreover, there is even a discord between the leading note and the<br/>tonic.<br/>&#x9;As soon as 4th bar, we have an analogous discord, where a chord<br/>traditionally analysed as a 7th chord on the second degree [supertonic]<br/>may be a major dominant ninth chord without root whose leading note<br/>would be delayed by the tonic. This interpretation a little convoluted<br/>allows equality between the two G of 4th and 5th bar where there is<br/>precisely a dominant chord. An analyse as a 2d degree would be quite<br/>complex, and, it would implied, in particular, the appearance of false<br/>&quot;identical notes&quot; [??? :-( &quot;notes communes&quot; in French...].<br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>End of first part.</p></div>
