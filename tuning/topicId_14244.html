Since 19-tET has virtually just minor thirds, a similar<br/>system could work as you describe, although the displacement between the two<br/>chains would have to be 1/3 rather than 1/4 syntonic comma.</p><p>&gt;So,what if we instead add displaced notes giving just major thirds to the<br/>&gt;near perfect fifths of 12-tet?The result is a 24 note tuning that can be<br/>&gt;specified in .TUN format like this:</p><p>&gt;notes 2<br/>&gt;1 0.0719<br/>&gt;2 0.08333333</p><p>I suggested this 24-note system on this list many times and played with it.<br/>I don&apos;t know know what .tun format is, but I&apos;d tune the two 12-tET chains 15<br/>cents apart. The unfortunate thing about this system is that the 15-cent<br/>melodic shifts can be audible and sometimes disturbing, while the &lt;6-cent<br/>melodic shifts of Vicentino&apos;s second system are too small to be audible.<br/>However, for music that uses enharmonic equivalencies, like Schubert&apos;s<br/>cycles of thirds, Vicentino&apos;s system would not work and this system of two<br/>12-tET chains 15 cents apart would be the only way to get adaptive JI<br/>(within one cent).</p><p>&gt;This kind of tuning can also be used for perfect 7-limit intervals,as in:</p><p>&gt;notes 2<br/>&gt;1 0.0574<br/>&gt;2 0.08333333</p><p>&gt;Which makes the thirds kinda low.This&quot;in between&quot;version is better then:</p><p>&gt;notes 2<br/>&gt;1 0.0647<br/>&gt;2 0.08333333</p><p>&gt;This is not perfected,but i would like to see if you can do something with<br/>&gt;it or if it has been done before...</p><p>I played with all these options back when I had a Casio CZ-1 -- I tuned the<br/>lower half of the keyboard up two or three octaves and up either 15, 31, or<br/>23 cents. When I tried playing conventional progressions, I found the 23- or<br/>31- cent melodic shifts to be too large to bear, while the 15-cent ones were<br/>somewhat tolerable.</p><p>Harald Waage, in the pages of 1/1, has proposed a system where there would<br/>be more than two 12-tET cycles, separated by 16 cents. Using two cycles 16<br/>cents apart would get you the 5s, 32 cents would get you the 7s, and 48<br/>cents the 11s. Of course, 72-tET is the logical culmination of this line of<br/>attack.</p></div><h3><a id=14260 href="#14260">ðŸ”—</a>Mats &#xFFFD;ljare &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2000 6:37:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Nicolai Vicentino,besides being one of the earliest advocates for &gt;&gt;31-tet,suggested a tuning based on a segment of 1/4 comma meantone with<br/>&gt;&gt;just fifths to a few of the tonics.This gives just fifths,thirds AND minor &gt;&gt;thirds,displaced by the comma of the two superimposed chains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Which is 1/4 syntonic comma.</p><p>Or an entire fifth,depending on how you see it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Mention has also been made on this list(not sure if it was Vicentino&#xFFFD;s &gt;&gt;idea or not)of a<br/>&gt;&gt;full 19-tet circle,plus 19 displaced tones also giving just thirds,fifths &gt;&gt;and minor thirds,although the tonics still has to move in a cycle based on &gt;&gt;19-tet fifths.</p><p>&gt;Mats, if you replace 19-tET with 1/4-comma meantone in the above, both &gt;ideas<br/>&gt;were Vicentino&apos;s (in 1555), according to Margo Schulter.

This would give 38 notes<br/>in all. However, he found it difficult to get more than 17 notes onto<br/>the second manual, thus his actual instrument of 36 notes.</p><p>In the &quot;adaptive JI tuning,&quot; the first 19 notes are tuned as in the<br/>31-note cycle tuning, very likely in 1/4-comma meantone. This gives us<br/>a range of Gb-B#, later standard for the &quot;chromatic harpsichords&quot;<br/>popular around Naples in the epoch around 1600.</p><p>The second manual now has its notes tuned in pure fifths to the first<br/>manual, 17 notes on Vicentino&apos;s actual instrument and all 19 notes in<br/>his original design. This gives us adaptive JI either over the<br/>complete base range of Gb-B#, or in the 36-note version over the range<br/>of Gb-A# (it may have been the E# and B# levels that were pesky to<br/>include on that second manual).</p><p>As you&apos;ve shown, Paul, Vicentino&apos;s scheme would in fact be very nice<br/>even with two standard 12-note keyboards, say Eb-G#, calling for only<br/>24 notes in all. We would be able to get adaptive JI for the great<br/>majority of the 16th-century repertory which fits nicely within this<br/>typical meantone range.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I (and others) tune this as a standard? The problems are<br/>purely pragmatic and mechanical: in a live performance, playing<br/>variously spaced Renaissance 5-limit sonorities with the right finger<br/>on the right key on the right manual seems just to complicated. Here I<br/>might add that two MIDI controllers with some depth make it more<br/>impractical, while an ideally designed double keyboard or the like<br/>might make it a bit less impractical.</p><p>If we shift to MIDI sequencing, however, or even to some hypothetical<br/>16th-century Nancarrow&apos;s player-organ or player-harpsichord, then this<br/>complication is no longer an issue, and Vicentino&apos;s solution seems<br/>ideal for 16th-century music on a fixed-pitch instrument.</p><p>Even Vicentino&apos;s known experimental pieces and examples using<br/>&quot;enharmonic&quot; fifthtones would require no more than 48 notes in all,<br/>each having a base range of no more than 24 notes. While Colonna<br/>(1618) has an &quot;example of circulation&quot; touring all 31 steps,<br/>Vicentino&apos;s known pieces follow a scheme more like two 12-note<br/>meantone gamuts a diesis apart, the basis of my 24-note archicembalo<br/>arrangement. For adaptive JI we should be able to make due with twice<br/>this number, 48.</p><p>Here I&apos;m not taking into account the complication that three major<br/>thirds and four minor thirds in a 31-note meantone cycle will be<br/>altered by ~6.07 cents, the difference between 31 fifths and 18 pure<br/>octaves; but with no more than 24 notes needed for any one piece, we<br/>should be able to get all the base intervals at their regular sizes,<br/>so that 48 notes suffice for our adaptive JI.</p><p>For a complete 31 note cycle with adaptive JI on every step, I guess<br/>that we might need an extra four notes at each level (31 + 4 = 35), or<br/>70 notes in all.</p><p>Incidentally, Vicentino describes his method both as tuning in &quot;pure<br/>fifths,&quot; and as involving &quot;comma keys,&quot; that is, keys differing from<br/>others by a &quot;comma&quot; he defines (in one meaning) as the amount by which<br/>the fifth is &quot;tempered&quot; or &quot;blunted&quot; in keyboard temperaments, likely<br/>equivalent in this meaning to &quot;1/4-syntonic-comma.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=14280 href="#14280">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
