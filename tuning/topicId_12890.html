Here&apos;s a guy who uses the<br/>&gt;word &quot;Harmony&quot; in the TITLE of his book, yet has not ONE WORD about<br/>&gt;the harmonic series inside!  Another thing I remember from a quick<br/>&gt;perusal is a pearl of wisdom, something like, &quot;As to the question of how<br/>&gt;many major seconds there are, we have only to look at the piano<br/>&gt;keyboard to know that the answer is one.&quot;</p><p>Reminds me of a lecture I heard Joseph Strauss give about Henry Cowell.
