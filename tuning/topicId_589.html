But I look<br/>&gt; forward to using it now that it has been pointed out :-)</p><p>Thanks. It is really easy to miss that kind of a thing, and I can<br/>well understand.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping to add a few neat things to the relaying from Jacky&apos;s<br/>questions and suggestions.</p><p>&gt; FTS is an awesome program.  Everyone making microtonal music (on a<br/>&gt; PC) would make their lives easier using it.</p><p>&gt; I still think it would be neat on a PalmPilot.</p><p>I do too.</p><p>It would be quite a fun challenge to write a program for such<br/>a small (160 by 160 pixels) screen, and stylus input.</p><p>One is really talking about a new program from scratch - single<br/>threaded to start with - FTS plays the tune by starting a<br/>new thread, as is standard practice in writing for the low level<br/>midi api in Windows.</p><p>(This means you can continue to interact with the program using<br/>the ordinary interface, while the midi playing continues in<br/>the high resolution timing mode of the midi api).</p><p>Also, a number of things to do with the way the code needs to<br/>be written.</p><p>I&apos;ve been browsing this site by palmpilot for developers to find<br/>out more.<br/><a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/">http://www.palmos.com/dev/</a><br/>esp.<br/><a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/intro.html">http://www.palmos.com/dev/intro.html</a></p><p>I know that when one uses a program the interface is (hopefully)<br/>kind of transparent most of the time. Especially things like<br/>exactly how the mouse / keyboard work and interact with the program<br/>and the screen, and the details of how the program is able to receive<br/>your input etc.</p><p>It&apos;s only really when one tries actually writing a program that one<br/>becomes aware of these things (like only noticing<br/>rough edges to paintwork if one has been doing<br/>decorating oneself).</p><p>Would indeed be fun to write a tiny program with all<br/>those limitations. I expect I&apos;d learn a lot from<br/>doing it, especially to do with learning to<br/>make a gui for such a tiny screen. Who knows,<br/>some day maybe,...</p><p>There&apos;s a fair amount of free palmpilot example<br/>source code programs, palmpilot emulators<br/>for the p.c., and development tools, so there is quite a<br/>lot of support available, should I ever decide to<br/>try something along these lines, so I gather from the<br/>web reading I&apos;ve been doing.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
