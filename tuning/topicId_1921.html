I understand you mean this<br/>chord has no real root, or maybe a lot of possible roots. I do agree, a<br/>traditional dim chord is an ET4(an octave divided in 4 equal parts).<br/>But a dim chord also exist in JI:</p><p>note                  e   :  g   : bes  : des<br/>common subharmonic    5   :  6   :  7<br/>common harmonic           : 1/7  : 1/6  : 1/5<br/>otonal               25   :  30  :  35  :  42<br/>utonal              1/42  : 1/35 : 1/30 : 1/25</p><p>As you see, 5,6,7 there is no multiple of 2 (4,8,16,32..) involved.<br/>So in JI a clear root is missing as well.<br/>You are right. Now it&apos;s not as polyvalent as in ET, because 5:6 is not equal<br/>to 6:7, being the same interval in ET.</p><p>Therefor I like a recalculation of JI at each very moment, adapted to the<br/>context. So chords can softly fluctuate. Retuning on the flight as you wish.</p><p>Peter Mulkers (Belgium)</p></div><h3>David Mezquita &#x3C;DMEZQUI@xxxxxxxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/1999 6:36:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Peter Mulkers wrote:</p><p>&gt;What do you mean with the ambiguity of a chord?

It exists in JI, and it was in fact a common chord in the<br/>Baroque. But it was normally used over the 7th note of a minor scale (for<br/>example G#-B-D-F in A minor), and the resolution tended to be the tonica or<br/>a near chord. The accord had no ambiguity, because G# was not Ab, B was not<br/>Cb, etc... So it is logical to play it in JI.</p><p>But in 19th Century the notes of this chord were modified enharmonically, so<br/>that the chord can bring you easily to at least 4 tonalities. That&apos;s why I<br/>said &quot;ambiguity&quot;. In ET the four Modulations are identic, so that ET offers<br/>more possibilities for modulating. I&apos;m not saying that the whole work sounds<br/>better in ET. So I agree fully with your words...</p><p>&gt;Therefor I like a recalculation of JI at each very moment, adapted to the<br/>&gt;context. So chords can softly fluctuate. Retuning on the flight as you<br/>wish.</p><p>That&apos;s it... One has to analise the work, understand the harmonic and the<br/>melodic structure and many other things, and then decide about the<br/>intonation.</p><p>David Mezquita.</p></div><h3>Can Akkoc &#x3C;akkoc@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/1999 9:21:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 21 Mar 1999, Peter Mulkers wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Peter Mulkers&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:P.Mulkers@gmx.net">P.Mulkers@gmx.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello David,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I really feel like an old experienced tuner,<br/>&gt; cause I am on the tuninglist now for more than a month. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Therefor I like a recalculation of JI at each very moment, adapted to the<br/>&gt; context.

I am<br/>inclined to think in terms of constantly changing &grave;local&apos; scales at the<br/>micro level running within the framework of a &grave;global&apos; or macro setting.<br/>However, in Turkish music these local scales do not necessarily have to be<br/>JI.</p><p>&gt; Ta Da!
