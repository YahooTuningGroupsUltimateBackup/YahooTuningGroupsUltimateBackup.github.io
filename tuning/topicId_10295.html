Also, it&apos;s a great example of small<br/>&gt; mistunings causing a significant affect on the &quot;mood&quot; of a piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks, Carl... glad you enjoyed it.  I&apos;m not really certain why some of<br/>these files are as different as they are, since some of our<br/>knowledgables on the list feel they shouldn&apos;t be... maybe it&apos;s the<br/>particular frequencies used?? Dunno.</p><p>To me also, it seems the mood swings significantly from example to<br/>example depending, most probably, on the &quot;beating.&quot;  This is obviously<br/>related to some of the discussions concerning the major and minor and<br/>derivations from Otonal/Utonal... (And even Helmholtz&apos;s over-simplified<br/>&quot;happy-sad&quot;)</p><p>___________ ______ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
