I&apos;ll try improvising with the scales you&apos;ve mentioned, starting with Centaur and hopefully I&apos;ll be able to tease out some new sounds.</p><p>I started a topic about Eikosanies a couple of weeks ago, but am not really any closer to understanding them. My issue is how to reveal the structure of the Eikosany when pitches are mapped linearly to a MIDI keyboard. Am I going about things the wrong way?</p><p>Cheers again, I&apos;ll have fun. ;-)</p><p>Sean</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kraig Grady&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; here is the simplest 7 limit i have used to good effect and think it as a good way to learn these intervals.<br/>&gt;  you might try the inversion of this also.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://anaphoria.com/centaur.html">http://anaphoria.com/centaur.html</a><br/>&gt; In the Wilson archive i added a set of early 12 tone scales Erv and Gard David came up with.<br/>&gt;  further down there are the Marwa and Purvi material originally found in xenharmonikon which are good places to play with too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  the 22 tone 1-3-7-9-11-15 Eikosany is a good scale on the large size or Erv has a good 7 limit 22.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Canwright&apos;s 2 harmonics series a 3/2 apart 8-16 is a good place to explore.<br/>&gt;  The subharmonic version too.</p></div>
