I assume this is the<br/>&gt;internet routing slowing down the packages, and perhaps this is a more<br/>&gt;common problem then something being wrong at either end itself?</p><p>Where&apos;s the BBC server?  Distance is probably the ingredient.  That qualifies as &quot;internet routing&quot; -- so you&apos;re correct.  Server overload and ISP overload are not uncommon, though.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s always a good idea to have as much memory as your operating system<br/>&gt;can handle.</p><p>That would mean in the Gigabytes for most OS&apos;s today.  Most people would<br/>not be able to tell if you added or subtracted RAM over 128megs.  256 is<br/>about the limit for power users.  More is only needed for servers, loading<br/>large samples to RAM, or other specialized applications.</p><p>&gt;A fast machine also makes a difference, the machine I&apos;m using now (266<br/>&gt;mhtz) has problems with me doing almost anything while I&apos;m 1. brodcasting<br/>&gt;real audio (49/32 Radio) 2. listening to ra or mp3 files while my 366<br/>&gt;mhtz laptop handles all this with ease.</p><p>Something else is probably going on there, David.  100mhz on an Intel processor shouldn&apos;t account for much.</p><p>~~</p><p>Starrett mentions speed regarding BeOS...  I was just thinking it was<br/>interesting how most PII users would get more of a practical speed<br/>increase with a free upgrade to Be 5 than a $2500 upgrade to the latest<br/>PIII hardware.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
