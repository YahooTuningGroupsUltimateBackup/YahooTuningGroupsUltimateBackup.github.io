For example, I recently wrote a chorale in six voices based on Bach&apos;s &quot;Es ist genug&quot; where the principal harmonies are subsets of Otonalities and Utonalities within the Monophonic Fabric, but all voices contain traditional non-harmonic devices.  I would have gone on to write more music in this fashion (i.e., fugues, chorale preludes, etc.), but I was on a sequencer where I had to go in and place the pitch bend values manually for every single tone, which was just a major pain.  I thought about using Scala to retune these MIDI files, but I can&apos;t seem to figure out how to use this feature (I tried to retune a MIDI file into 1/4-comma meantone, but the result ended up sounding like cows dying, so I must be doing something wrong.)     Any thoughts on any of this?  Also, if anyone could e-mail me privately about good graduate schools where people on the composition faculty understand JI and other alternative tunings, I&apos;d really appreciate it.  Most people here at Bowling Green State University in Ohio look at me funny and say it just all sounds out of tune (I had people literally running from my grad office screaming when I played the Otonal hexad -- especially when I started with it in 12-tET and then &quot;fixed&quot; it).
