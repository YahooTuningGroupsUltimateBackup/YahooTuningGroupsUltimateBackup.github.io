If an approximation moves beyond the metastable point, and therefore outside its tolerance range, the degree of approximation is meaningless.</p><p>For this to work you need to specify a finite set of intervals.  Perhaps there&apos;s a way of fixing the relative sizes of the tolerance ranges for simple intervals regardless of the limit and, who knows, maybe Tenney complexity approximates it.</p><p>Using noble mediants as the metastable points would naturally give an error measure that&apos;s asymmetrical with regard to sharp and flat mistunings.

So firstly, equal weighting of intervals is consistent with what you observe, and secondly, Tenney weighting of primes gives similar results to equal weighting of intervals, for arbitrarily complex intervals.</p><p>As for fifths, it depends on how you like added ninths.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The fact that TOP errors depend so much on which prime<br/>&gt;&gt;limit you choose (and don&apos;t have a sensible limit for an<br/>&gt;&gt;arbitrarily large prime limit) tells me that it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;work.<br/>&gt; &gt; Not sure what you mean here.  TOP errors don&apos;t change<br/>&gt; with limit unless you need to throw a new set of commas<br/>&gt; in the kernel.  But usually there is more than one way<br/>&gt; to extend a temperament to higher limits, so one would<br/>&gt; hope the tuning would change between them.</p><p>You can always choose a smaller prime limit in a unique way.   When you work it out, dropping a load of inaudible primes always has too much impact with Tenney weighting.</p><p>&gt; Or maybe you meant something to do with the following...<br/>&gt; For conceptual reasons, it has long appealed to me to use<br/>&gt; a weighting strong than Tenney&apos;s, such that any sort of<br/>&gt; harmonic limit would be unnecessary -- the changes in the<br/>&gt; error would get so small beyond, say, the 17-limit, that<br/>&gt; you could just as well not bother to calculate them.</p><p>Yes.  But you have to make sure you don&apos;t penalize 7-limit intervals so much that they don&apos;t count either.  You need to be nice to the intervals you want and severely punish the ones you don&apos;t want.  Which means it becomes highly subjective and I don&apos;t think we have the empirical data to decide on that yet.  You may as well choose a prime or odd limit.</p><p>&gt; This approach would appeal to someone who likes the<br/>&gt; harmonic series but wants to simplify his pitch set (say,<br/>&gt; for use on a keyboard).  The problem is, the number of<br/>&gt; notes needed to make accurate temperament of these larger<br/>&gt; limits grows very rapidly.  The &apos;juicy plums&apos; of these<br/>&gt; extended tunings seem to be the new intervals themselves,<br/>&gt; with modulation on top of it being too much to handle at<br/>&gt; this stage (in the evolution of music).  Therefore,<br/>&gt; targeting temperaments at the 7-limit and so forth seems<br/>&gt; a useful thing to do, and just use JI in the 17-limit.<br/>&gt; OK, I&apos;m thinking aloud at this point.</p><p>When you use temperaments there&apos;s always a chance that a higher prime interval will be simple on the keyboard.  So by all means concentrate on simple intervals but it&apos;s better not to segregate according to prime limits.  Except that it makes everything easier so we do it anyway.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I also disagree that a minimax is the best way of measuring &gt;&gt;errors in a weighted prime limit.<br/>&gt; &gt; How different are minimax and RMS tunings, really?</p><p>It seems to be more important in higher limits.  But if they&apos;re similar, why not go for RMS, which is simpler to calculate?  The default still seems to be minimax.</p><p>&gt;&gt;A minimax makes more sense for the kind of &gt;&gt;weighting Tenney proposed -- where simple intervals have &gt;&gt;more wiggle room, not less.<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;re saying this is what he proposed in his Cage paper?<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been meaning to read that, after having downloaded<br/>&gt; it recently.</p><p>It&apos;s on page 22.

The error will also be<br/>&gt; twice as large.  With prime weighting, the buoyancy&apos;s always<br/>&gt; twice as large as well.  That means both intervals have the<br/>&gt; same weighted error.

Paul doesn&apos;t mention the simplicity.  But whatever your reasons are for choosing them, the weights always add up like this.</p><p>&gt;&gt;so the obvious choice of weights is to weight all partials &gt;&gt;according to their sizes.<br/>&gt; &gt; Then the buoyancy of 225/224 will be large compared to the<br/>&gt; buoyancies of 3, 5, and 7, yet it is a much smaller interval.<br/>&gt; So this seems a really odd way to explain it.</p><p>225/224 isn&apos;t a partial of a harmonic series.  It&apos;s an interval between partials, and so it&apos;s buoyancy is the sum of the buoyancies of the partials it&apos;s measured between. This is true for all prime weightings, and so identifies buoyancy with complexity and makes the weighting inversely proportional to the complexity.</p><p>Obviously you can&apos;t weight all intervals by their sizes. You can weight them by complexity but the definition of complexity gets circular.  So instead you can look at the weights of the partials.  Tenney weighting is the unique choice where the weight of a partial depends only on its size.  Alternatively, the weight of a ratio depends on the sizes of the numbers and not their prime factorizations.</p><p>Tenney weighting is the only prime weighting scheme that&apos;s fair to all primes.

Historically, musicians were not only interested in primes.  The tunings they used were chosen in the light of all the intervals they used.</p><p>You&apos;re also betraying octave-equivalent thinking if you equate thirds and fifths with prime numbers.  In octave-equivalent terms, the optimal tuning of octaves is always pure.  When you look at the full prime factorization you&apos;ll see that 2 is still naturally more important.</p><p>&gt;&gt;So firstly, equal weighting of intervals is &gt;&gt;consistent with what you observe,<br/>&gt; &gt; ???

Can you give an example?</p><p>I did some experiments calculating the errors of equal temperaments in stupidly large prime limits a while back.  I don&apos;t have the results to hand.  But I think you&apos;re aware of the problems from what you say below.</p><p>&gt; Yes, I ran into this.  My first thought was to weight<br/>&gt; according to the typical timbre of the human voice, which<br/>&gt; according to &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; is ~ 1/n^2 for harmonic n.  But yeah, this probably<br/>&gt; penalizes 7 and 11 too much (though I haven&apos;t calculated<br/>&gt; any tunings, just looked at the curve).  You can<br/>&gt; subtract 1 from the harmonic number before squaring to<br/>&gt; help a little bit (and to fix the octave value at 1, which<br/>&gt; is nice), but it probably still isn&apos;t enough.</p><p>I think 1/n^2 will converge on a single answer, but still too slowly.  You can try it anyway.</p><p>&gt; Plain 1/n has the justification that it is the fraction<br/>&gt; of partials with n as a factor.</p><p>Sum of 1/n doesn&apos;t converge.  Perhaps it&apos;ll work for errors, because they&apos;re randomly distributed about zero, but it&apos;s still biased towards stupidly high primes.</p><p>&gt; And then there&apos;s Gene&apos;s 1/sqrt(p), &quot;apeing the Zeta function<br/>&gt; on the critical line&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; But all of these seem too flat between 15 and 23.</p><p>There you go.  It has to be more complicated.</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s also something suggested by Vos in his experiments,<br/>&gt; but I never got the precise details of what it was, I just<br/>&gt; remember it says 1. simpler intervals suffer worse from a<br/>&gt; given amount of detuning and 2. the suffering is an exponential<br/>&gt; of the detuning.</p><p>That sounds right.  An exponential will give more emphasis to simpler intervals.</p><p>&gt; What I meant was, high-limit JI has plenty of low-hanging<br/>&gt; fruit to occupy composers without lots of modulation.  If<br/>&gt; you&apos;re interested in this fruit, you&apos;re probably not going<br/>&gt; to want to sacrifice the purity of the intervals enough to<br/>&gt; improve modulation much on physical instruments.</p><p>There are also considerations of notation for flexible pitched instruments.  It depends on how high your limit gets.  I think there are applications for temperaments (or at least mappings) in middling-limits.  And prime limits are a crutch.</p><p>&gt; Minimax is just easier to understand the implications of.<br/>&gt; Maybe that&apos;s only the case because Paul&apos;s paper is easier<br/>&gt; to read than yours, I dunno.</p><p>You should have known about TOP-max before reading the paper.  I was arguing for TOP-RMS before it was written.  I thought maybe it was a question of branding, because &quot;TOP&quot; sounds better than &quot;Tenney-weighted prime least squares optimum&quot; or whatever mouthful I had to describe TOP-RMS as.   But I couldn&apos;t find a better acronym than TOP, so I redefined TOP to mean the wider family of tunings. Unfortunately this hasn&apos;t caught on so &quot;TOP-RMS&quot; still looks more complicated than plain &quot;TOP&quot;.</p><p>TOP-RMS is such a blindingly simple concept that you shouldn&apos;t need to read a paper to understand.  It&apos;s the least squares optimal tuning of weighted primes.  What more obvious way could there be to optimize a temperament, given weighted prime limits?  Any explanation I try to give is going to fail because whatever words I use are going to get in the way of the brute simplicity of the concept.  I&apos;d expect people to rediscover it themselves as the most obvious thing to do.  Gene did so by at least one route. Most of the paper&apos;s about less obvious ways of calculating it.</p><p>The argument for TOP-RMS would be that it&apos;s a crude approximation to average mistuning pain.  The pain of mistuning an interval depends on its complexity and the amount of mistuning.  The dependence on mistuning is more than linear because 10 cents out is more than twice as bad as 5 cents out.  Maybe it should be exponential but quadratic will do given all the other things that are wrong.</p><p>I&apos;m assuming that mistuning pain manifests itself as an increased dissonance in the interval.  So different mistuings will be perceived with different pains but this doesn&apos;t depend on the listener recognizing the target interval.</p><p>Because listeners are only hearing relative mistuning pain for different tunings, the overall mistuning pain of a chord will be the average mistuning pain of its intervals. Mistuning also contributes to the overall dissonance of a chord but for that you have to start simpler intervals with a lower dissonance.</p><p>I can see that it does make sense to assume that listeners do some kind of prime factorization, and are then troubled by the discrepancy between theory and practice.  In this case they will be aware of the absolute amount of mistuning.   But it&apos;s easier to recognize simple intervals with a given amount of mistuning.  So TOP-like measures don&apos;t work here.   It&apos;s Tenney&apos;s tolerance range that we need to look at.</p><p>What, then, does the minimax of the prime-weighted errors mean?  It isn&apos;t the worst mistuning pain because that isn&apos;t linearly proportional to the error.  And with this weighting of errors, listeners aren&apos;t aware of the absolute pain, only the relative pain for different tunings.  So how are they hearing the worst absolute mistuning pain?  This has never made sense to me.</p><p>&gt; Well simpler intervals are associated with wider harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy minima (as I said).  So consonance maybe should be<br/>&gt; a two-dimensional affair -- one for the slope of minima<br/>&gt; and one for the width.  Any suggestions how that might be<br/>&gt; formulated?</p><p>We know that consonance is more than one dimensional.  But this is more about mistuning pain.  Even a one dimensional plot of sensory consonance can support different ways of measuring mistuning pain.  I can think of three:</p><p>1) Average mistuning pain resulting from dissonance</p><p>This is what TOP-RMS approximates.  For a more rigorous calculation, you need a dissonance curve.  Note that the model behind Sethares-type dissonance naturally leads to average dissonance of intervals in a chord as the thing you look at, rather than worst dissonance.</p><p>2) Most dissonant interval</p><p>You can see odd-limit minimaxes as approximating this.  The main advantage of an odd-limit minimax is that it&apos;s the easiest kind of error to explain: you take these intervals, and they&apos;re all no more than so many cents out of tune. Realistically, that&apos;s going to be the justification for using them as well.</p><p>You can also draw equal-dissonance lines on a dissonance graph and see that there&apos;s a point where all intervals of an odd-limit have about the same mistuning.  So choosing an odd limit and a worst error means no intervals will be worse than a given dissonance.</p><p>This does assume that you&apos;ll only use consonances with the intervals you chose.  I think it&apos;s also less valid for higher limits.  If I&apos;m using the 11-limit, that doesn&apos;t mean I want all 11-limit intervals to be of equal dissonance. But if you&apos;re happy with a set of intervals being not much more dissonant than the worst 11-limit ones you can choose temperaments this way.</p><p>3) Mistuning pain from identifying JI archetypes</p><p>This is where complex intervals should be more in tune because they&apos;re harder to recognize.  You have to choose the intervals you think it&apos;s possible to hear relative to JI. It follows Tenney&apos;s tolerance range or Partch&apos;s observation whatever.  As I said a while back in this thread, metastable points may be useful in determining the tolerance range.</p><p>It makes sense to take a minimax of this, but maybe an average is valid as well.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=73870 href="#73870">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2007 1:29:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham wrote...</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ultimately, Paul&apos;s justification for Tenney weighting is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that it gives TOP-max the useful property of being the same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;weighted minimax for any sufficiently large subset of a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;prime limit.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sufficiently large??<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;You need at least as many intervals as there are primes.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;And presumably a linearly independent set at that point.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The TOP damage of any single interval will be &lt;= to the<br/>&gt; &gt; TOP damage for the tuning.

There are<br/>&gt; &gt; other weighting schemes.  The &quot;point of prime weighting&quot;, as<br/>&gt; &gt; you say, is to 1. save calculations and 2. be vague about<br/>&gt; &gt; what intervals you&apos;re interested in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are different ways of justifiying prime weighting.<br/>&gt; Paul doesn&apos;t mention the simplicity.

Gene asked the question, but he&apos;s worryingly quiet now, so he can&apos;t explain what it means.  It looks like TOP-RMS is the optimal tuning for the whole Tenney-weighted prime limit though.  Working out what the error means is harder.  I can&apos;t solve the interval, and I can&apos;t find the right normalized average that converges numerically.</p><p>In practice I don&apos;t care about any of this because I know that Tenney weighting&apos;s wrong.  All that matters is that it gives better results for the temperaments we know about than anything else as simple.  It&apos;s easy to work out the numbers and I give a lot of examples in the PDF.  (I could do that better but I don&apos;t like to think about it because it reminds me how much work there is left.)  I don&apos;t hink TOP-RMS is any worse in practice than TOP-max so it wins by being simpler (Occam&apos;s razor).</p><p>If you want to find an average for which TOP-RMS is the approximation, you could look at Bayesian statistics.  It might keep you quiet at least ;-)  I say this because the book I&apos;m reading now says &quot;Bayesian analysis is an excellent alternative to use of large sample asymptotic statistical procedures&quot; and it seems to know what it&apos;s talking about.
