Brad Catler played a fretless bass in an<br/>idiosyncratic, and constantly changing 12, while there was a 12-TET set of 8<br/>timpani, and idiosyncratic pitch differences in the remaining electronic<br/>sounds.</p><p>Wendy didn&apos;t believe it would be possible to &quot;acousticize&quot; her piece more<br/>successfully than her own wholly electronic ideas.  I successfully<br/>demonstrated that the acoustifying adds to the performance.  I believe she<br/>says as much on her web site.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
