But it is possible to send it new tuning tables within a piece.<br/>One way of doing that is with the Justonic Pitch Pallet. Another way<br/>would be to embed the sysex within a MIDI file.</p><p>By the way, I don&apos;t allways keep up with the list these days (too much<br/>to keep up with), but do lurk around sometimes, which is how I found<br/>this question.</p><p>Denny Genovese</p></div>
