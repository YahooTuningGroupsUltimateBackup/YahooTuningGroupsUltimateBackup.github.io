If I am offended and<br/>pursued about my well-meant work and am reviled, then I assign it to God, the<br/>just judge, and can not digress to mention how I, because of my Orgel-Probe<br/>and temperament published in the year 1781, had a special enemy, namely one<br/>old well-known organ builder who because he already died and is under the<br/>judgment of the great God, will not be mentioned by name.&quot;</p><p>Wonder who the organ builder was?  Here the publishing date of the<br/>temperament is 1681...in the singular.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>&quot;</p></div>
