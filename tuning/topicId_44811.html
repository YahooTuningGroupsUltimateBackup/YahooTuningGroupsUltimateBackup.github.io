Peoples who use all<br/>other system (what ever we call it, &sup3;temperament&sup2;, JIÂŠ) in the traditional<br/>ethnic ways, usually don&sup1;t use harmony (even it must be exceptions like<br/>usualÂŠ). They use &sup3;p&eacute;dale&sup2; or &sup3;bourdon&sup2;, rarely more than 2 sounds together<br/>(&sup3;contrepoint&sup2; is an other problemÂŠ).<br/>ET doesn&sup1;t permit harmony. Harmony is a necessity in ET ! Harmony is<br/>possible with many other scales, but just not necessaryÂŠ</p><p>We lost a lot with the &sup3;nuances&sup2; in between, we needed something to balance<br/>it and gave interest again in music hearingÂŠ and we found harmony more and<br/>more sophisticated (the seventh, then ninth, etc. ÂŠ) Isn&sup1;t it that Fran&ccedil;ois<br/>call : complex constructions such as the &quot;Tristan chord&quot; ?</p><p>One question is why we enter in this way in &sup3;old&sup2; Europe ? We began with<br/>&sup3;organum&sup2; and &sup3;gymel&sup2;, (strates of 2 sounds) and why did we hardly get to 3<br/>sounds (quite difficult with Pythagorean scale). The scales was still rich<br/>(in terms of &sup3;nuances&sup2;ÂŠ). So, the reason could be &sup3;extra-musicale&sup2; !</p><p>I found that it could be a kind of religious question. In european medieval<br/>times, the perfection was symbolised by the &sup3;sainte trinit&eacute;&sup2;. (&sup3;Ternaire&sup2;<br/>was the perfect rythmic system and so onÂŠ). So we get to triad, more easily<br/>with &sup3;m&eacute;sotonique&sup2; and &sup3;temp&eacute;rament&sup2; - few 7th, with much precautions,<br/>&sup3;pr&eacute;parations&sup2; and &sup3;r&eacute;solutions&sup2; - but no really more far than this untill<br/>ET&sup1;s time.</p><p>I am not sure that it is a scientific resolution of the question but I don&sup1;t<br/>really careÂŠ</p><p>All the words in between &sup3; &sup2; are french (when I am not certain for the<br/>translations).
