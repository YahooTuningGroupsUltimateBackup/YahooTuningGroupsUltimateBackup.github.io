If not, I defer to your expertise -- I was merely<br/>&gt;&gt;replying to the older version of your book.</p><p>I was actually answering Alison and hadn&apos;t really realised that what I<br/>wrote would have been construed as an answer to you (Paul)!</p><p>To state the obvious - there are different &apos;standards&apos; that are being<br/>talked about here:</p><p>1) standard compositional tuning system<br/>2) standard notation<br/>3) standard instruments</p><p>Equally obviously, there exists no global artistic consensus (amongst<br/>&apos;microtonalists&apos;) about (1), although it _may_ be possible to discern<br/>broad separate consensae amongst 1/4-tonalists, JI-ists, 72-ET-ers,<br/>continuum-ers etc.  Are you suggesting that a 72 division system will do<br/>the trick for everyone?  I can hear already the howls of dissension from<br/>many disparate fronts.  Individual composers seek to make pieces in more<br/>than one mutually exclusive tuning system.</p><p>My own concern at this point (aside from my compositional work) is to<br/>pursue the instrument issues.   The tuning issues prove to be more-or-<br/>less endless since there seems to be no single right answer.</p><p>In practice, progress with the instrument making projects will be<br/>determined by obtaining funding, finding the personnel, generating<br/>interest and openness to new technologies, finding performers to work<br/>with, and etc.</p><p>The choice of 1/4-tones and 19 for the woodwind and brass projects I<br/>mentioned are a practical, initial attempt, perhaps a compromise, based<br/>on a wide variety of factors. These choices were not made by me, and are<br/>not what I personally would have preferred.  But I support them as<br/>having been made in the interests of the project.  (As you know, Ezra<br/>Sims (Mister 72) has argued that 24-ET instruments would be<br/>significantly advantageous for realising a 72 division system - I am<br/>loathe to call it 72-ET in Ezra&apos;s case).  The instruments will provide<br/>19 too.</p><p>So I wouldn&apos;t say that CNMI has &apos;adopted 24 (or 19) as a standard&apos; - but<br/>now we&apos;ve started I guess there is a reason to try to make things that<br/>work together.  My hope is that later on, if we are successful,<br/>something else will be developed too.</p><p>With regard to my dreamy idea in &apos;21st C Orch Instrs&apos; that somehow<br/>microtonalists might want to pull together in one big club in the<br/>interests of seeing new instruments created in one ATS - well, just<br/>forget it.  They don&apos;t.  But if you can persuade them......!</p><p>Hope that&apos;s enough to clarify...</p><p>Patrick</p><p>--<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low,<br/><a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi</a><br/><a href="http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a><br/><a href="mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=24100 href="#24100">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 10:06:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Patrick Ozzard-Low &lt;pol@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; (As you know, Ezra<br/>&gt; Sims (Mister 72) has argued that 24-ET instruments would be<br/>&gt; significantly advantageous for realising a 72 division system - I am<br/>&gt; loathe to call it 72-ET in Ezra&apos;s case).</p><p>Why?
