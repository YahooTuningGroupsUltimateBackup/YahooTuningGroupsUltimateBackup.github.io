Rather hoping someone will<br/>beat me to it somehow!</p><p>One of those companies that can afford to employ a large number<br/>of developers working on the project and produce it in quite a short<br/>while. Or, maybe one of the established ones like Sibelius, or the<br/>one I use, Noteworthy Composer - maybe they&apos;d be able to use much<br/>of the same code they have already written.</p><p>I suppose microtonal music prob. needs to become more mainstream first as<br/>it would be a lot of work to do it with all the notations, symbols,<br/>etc, but I could imagine that it could become more mainstream in the<br/>not too distant future, as it gradually becomes easier to make microtonal<br/>music - computer programs, microtonal instruments, performers learning to<br/>play microtonal music on traditional instruments too (flute, violin,...)<br/>- all the things we are exploring together.</p><p>What I may be able to do in the fairly near future, is to add a save in<br/>text format showing all the cents values and ratios played at each note on / note off,<br/>so that each line of the file shows a chord, as in the text logs in my<br/>tunes page, but with timings added so that it can be played back<br/>in FTS.</p><p>I already have this in mind to do at some point, on request from<br/>Gene. (Idea to have a text log was originally one of Mary&apos;s ideas).</p><p>The one for replaying would show the times, and also show channel<br/>nubmers for ones with several midi in channels in play at once.</p><p>One could then edit the ratios in the log, and then replay it<br/>from the edited text - far from being a microtonal sequencer,<br/>but a possible first step on the very long path towards one.</p><p>Another option if anyone wanted it would be a guitar fret notation<br/>- so that one would define the frets for each string as<br/>A = scale<br/>B = scale,...<br/>at the beginning of the file.</p><p>Then in the text file one could type the guitar chords as<br/>a1b3c5 = frets 1 on string A, 3 on string b and 5 on string c</p><p>So file would look something like</p><p>a1b3c5<br/>t0.2</p><p>a2b4c3<br/>t0.5</p><p>where the t0.2, t0.5, are the times in secs, or maybe those could<br/>be shown as beats or something.</p><p>Could also maybe have some notation for volumes.</p><p>- or something like that - would need to consult with a guitarist<br/>for best way of doing it, and how one tells when notes get switched<br/>off, but I imagine something of that sort could possibly be quite useful<br/>for transcribing guitar / lute tablature into midi.</p><p>The text file could include repeat signs and flow direction<br/>as well (maybe even, looking a bit ahead, get the program to<br/>detect repeats when transcribing a midi file into text).</p><p>All that sort of thing is relatively easy because one doesn&apos;t need<br/>to work on the graphics, which would be quite involved.</p><p>Meanwhile, one can still do the thing of using a normal<br/>12-tet one, but retuning the midi notes on playback<br/>so that, e.g., midi notes 60 upwards play successive<br/>notes of the scale, whatever it is<br/>(or midi white notes from 60 upwards)<br/>as I do on my tunes page.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
