Just like someone can format and type gibberish into<br/>Word, there you have it. With a quick glance, the problems are:</p><p>- all data is assigned to channel 10 (go figure: drums)<br/>- there are four blank tracks, followed by the 8 tracks of the octet<br/>- apparantly this was all step-entered, as all the note values are<br/>severly quantized to exact values, and all the velocity data is 127<br/>- someone must have made a lame attempt at carving some volume<br/>musicality, as there are volume changes (CC 7). However, somewhere<br/>around bar 17 they get written as a value of 1, which essentially<br/>turns the volume off.</p><p>It was a pretty quick thing to fix all this in Sonar.</p><p>The raw notes are there, though I didn&apos;t have a score to check to see<br/>if things are correct. If you want a plain midi file with all the<br/>notes, just send me a private email with any details (like if you want<br/>different tracks assigned to different channels, etc). I will be away<br/>at work on Thurs, so Friday at the earliest.</p><p>I just love what people do to music with the computer sometimes. :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=63347 href="#63347">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2006 12:50:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; While not the only strange midi file on this site, it seems especially<br/>&gt; &gt; egregious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gee, you could have given a clue as to what you thought was wrong, or<br/>&gt; what was bothering you, but...</p><p>Mendelssohn&apos;s Octet is for strings only.

It amazes me<br/>that such a well-known piece hasn&apos;t been done to death already; this<br/>is even more of a warhorse than the Brahms string quartet #3. Mostly<br/>it&apos;s just a matter of finding out which instruments go where, which<br/>could be done by inspection, but I was hoping someone knew about<br/>whatever kind of midi file this is.

Anyway, I took a<br/>look at the file info, and it turns out it is probably a file that was<br/>auto-generated from the GNU LilyPond notation program. Why and how it<br/>didn&apos;t assign any instruments, added blank tracks, and put everything<br/>on channel 10 (the default drum channel for those locked into GM) is<br/>anybodies guess. It could be pilot error, it could be bugs in the<br/>auto-generation.</p><p>&gt; I was thinking of trying to turn it into<br/>&gt; something halfway decent, in extended meantone of course.</p><p>You&apos;ll have to do quite a bit of work, as even when I send it to you<br/>it will be pitches and rhythm only, no dynamics or phrasing.</p><p>&gt; Mostly<br/>&gt; it&apos;s just a matter of finding out which instruments go where, which<br/>&gt; could be done by inspection, but I was hoping someone knew about<br/>&gt; whatever kind of midi file this is.</p><p>It is still a midi file. It loaded with no problem and allows editing.<br/>It just wasn&apos;t done correctly. As I used in my example, a Microsoft<br/>Word document can be a perfectly valid file, even if filled with<br/>nonsense. The file is fine, the contents are not correct.</p><p>I&apos;ll have it ready by tomorrow, but I gotta run now...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=63351 href="#63351">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2006 9:04:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene,</p><p>One last thing: this is just the 2nd mvt, I don&apos;t know if you were<br/>hoping it was the complete piece.
