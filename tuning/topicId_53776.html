We can define it as a*i mod N, where i is an element of an<br/>index set S. Since a is invertible mod N, this defines all the<br/>possible scales; the point of introducing a and S is that S can be a<br/>set of contiguous numbers.</p><p>Now suppose we really wanted a scale in F*N-equal, consisting of F<br/>transpositions of the same scale. Carl defines his version of this as</p><p>(a*i mod N) + N*j, for all 0 &lt;= j &lt; F, i in S. This is the same as<br/>(a*i mod N) + N*j mod F*N.</p><p>I defined my version as</p><p>a*i + N*j mod F*N, for all 0 &lt;= j &lt; F, i in S</p><p>How are these related? a*i mod N and a*i mod F*N differ by a multiple<br/>of N, so (a*i mod N) + N*j mod F*N is a*i + N*k mod F*N for some value<br/>of k. If (N, F)=1 then if a*i + N*k = w mod F*N we can solve for k as<br/>(w-a*i)/N mod F, and the two definitions are the same. I&apos;ll take a<br/>look at what happens if N and F are not relatively prime.</p></div>
