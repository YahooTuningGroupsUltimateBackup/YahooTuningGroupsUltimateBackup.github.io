And, although I disagree with much of what is found in the<br/>Harvard Dictionary of Music, I believe that Ezra Sims was involved in writing<br/>the book, and he certainly has experience with the topic in question.</p></div><h3><a id=7338 href="#7338">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/28/1999 5:07:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I will quote from my 1985 paper &quot;Microtonality and its Application to<br/>Microtonality&quot; (P. 54)</p><p>    &quot;Microtonality relates to all of music through its common denominator of<br/>pitch.  There is no good reason to use a cultural model as a measure for all<br/>tone systems.  Accepting this, there can only be a vacuum, a tabula rasa to<br/>be filled in by pitch.  Noise, as a complex composite of pitch frequencies,<br/>though culturally considered as offensive and dissonant, is used<br/>compositionally and can conceivably be studied via spectral analysis.</p><p>    &quot;In actuality, the phenomenon of speech involves continuous fluctuations<br/>of pitch.  Though it is more apparent in languages like Chinese or Thai, it<br/>is an imporant and vital key to revealing the meaning of an English speaker<br/>when the words themselves are not enough.  Inflection in English can totally<br/>refute the literal meaning of the words spoken.  In Arabic, questions can be<br/>formed precisely by raising the pitch at the end of what otherwise might be a<br/>declarative sentence.</p><p>    &quot;Issues of tuning in a generic sense are integral to a variety of other<br/>spheres.  The relationship of heavenly bodies to each other as they orbit<br/>about each other is said to be possible only because of their precise tuning.<br/> If that &quot;tuning&quot; were to be altered, there would be collisions.</p><p>    &quot;From a social point of view, the understanding of diverse tunings brings<br/>us closer to &quot;foreign&quot; aesthetics.  The belief that &quot;music is an<br/>international language&quot; pales before the many musics difficult to comprehend.<br/> Understanding a vocabulary in all its nuances is a necessary step to<br/>understanding the language of a people.  This also follows for the tonal<br/>vocabulary of a music.  If nations could understand and appreciate each other<br/>culturally, a much needed degree of respect and trust could be developed<br/>between them.</p><p>    &quot;From the unique world perspective of human endeavors in tuning, all music<br/> contains subsets of the infinitude of pitch possibility.  So, all music<br/>contains microtones in theis sense, and so, all music can be considered<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; and within the realm of &apos;microtonality.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=7342 href="#7342">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@home.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/28/1999 9:50:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; I will quote from my 1985 paper &quot;Microtonality and its Application to<br/>&gt; Microtonality&quot; (P. 54)</p><p>I thought it was called Phenomenology and its Application to<br/>Microtonality.</p><p>You folks have to look at what you wrote before you<br/>click on that send  button.
