I have deleted the whole lot of the posts.</p><p>It is ridiculous that we cannot have a simple discussion about math on this forum without the entire thing degenerating into a flamewar about Carl Lumma, who has been fairly inactive recently. Carl is not the tuning list, and every single discussion that we have does not need to get into how this one time he shut someone down for having some theory at one point.</p><p>Stuff like this hinders productivity, and furthermore it has nothing to do with tuning.

Anybody saying<br/>&apos;and don&apos;t let so-and-so misdirect you with their sophistry&apos;<br/>should be just gone the 2nd time they do it.  Nothing like<br/>that would tolerated for a second on any other mailing list<br/>or forum I can think of!  It&apos;s completely ridiculous.  The<br/>only reason to bring me up is because I&apos;m the guy who&apos;s<br/>confronted it in the past.  I&apos;ll continue to do so, because<br/>tolerance of such behavior is ultimately the cause of the<br/>breakdowns you mention.  But I&apos;d rather moderators do it,<br/>because that&apos;s their job.   -Carl</p></div>
