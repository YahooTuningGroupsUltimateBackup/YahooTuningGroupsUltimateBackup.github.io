Harmonic entropy site&apos;s kind &apos;a deserted, so I thought<br/>I would post here...Does anyone know why the the main harmonic<br/>entropy graph does not include 15/8?   I noticed, in another ranking<br/>of interval dissonance (Campbell and Greated, 1987, ie, 2/1, 3/2,<br/>4/3, 5/4, 5/3,6/5,8/5,9/8,16/15), that this wonderful interval is<br/>also excluded.  (15/8 is a personal favorite of mine; leading tone<br/>and tonic combined in one chord!..., and, to my ear, and in my choice<br/>of chord construction, it serves as a &apos;near-octave....)</p><p>thanks, Kelly</p></div>
