I heard him live once, and for the<br/>&gt; first few seconds my mind bugged out at the sound he was producing, it<br/>&gt; sounded more like a piano, and my brain would not match it to the image of a<br/>&gt; guy on stage with a guitar. Awesome.</p><p>He has got so many abilities that one day he may become the Glenn Gould of<br/>the guitar, if he forgets about speed. (That&apos;s what Gould did, if you<br/>compare his first<br/>recording of the Goldberg Variations with the one he made much later) That&apos;s<br/>what I&apos;m hoping for and that&apos;s why I&apos;m curious to hear his Bach recordings.</p><p>&gt; He&apos;s constantly adjusting the tuning<br/>&gt; while he&apos;s playing, reaching across w/ his right hand to tweak a peg in the<br/>&gt; middle of a passage. I wonder if some of it is trying to adjust ET to sound<br/>&gt; better as the harmonies change.<br/>His transcription of Mussorgsky is full of scordatura. On stage this demands<br/>a special tuning-peg virtuosity, as strings go up or down almost immediately<br/>after the scodatura.<br/>&gt; I think most guitarists realize early on<br/>&gt; that there is no way to tune the third string so that both Cmajor and Emajor<br/>&gt; chords sound good, its one or the other. Of course it could be because all<br/>&gt; guitars are basically out of tune anyway, no matter what you do.<br/>When setting moveable frets into 12tet, the single fret for he G# on the<br/>third string ends up most of the time closer to the nut than the other ones.<br/>Sometimes up to 3 mm, especially with a thick G string. This difference is<br/>already less important for the A and tends to disappear around the C. To<br/>compensate the third string, I&apos;ve put a 2mm size piece of bone under the<br/>string right at the nut. In this way the moveable frets stay more or less in<br/>a straight line, which is the most comfortable way.<br/>&gt; (skip)</p><p>&gt; I think Wim had his moveable fret guitar in meantone to play Dowland<br/>&gt; at the last Microthon. A guitar hard-fretted in a given meantone would kind<br/>&gt; of limit the pieces you could play, unless of course what you wanted to do<br/>&gt; was make up your own.</p><p>Dowland indications are conceived for straight frets. The result sounds a<br/>bit like meantone, especially when you play in G (or g), since the fourth<br/>fret gives a low F# on the 2nd string and a low B on the first string. (I<br/>use a capo) The major third is in between the 4th and the 3d string and is<br/>exactly pythagorean. Joe Monzo gives a lot of information on his web-site:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>BTW: I played Dowland on the AFMM Festival in 1997 and 1999. Both of these<br/>concerts were at St. Paul&apos;s Chapel. On the Microthon 1999, where we met, I<br/>played Milan, Narvaez and Mudarra in 5-limit Just Intonation.</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
