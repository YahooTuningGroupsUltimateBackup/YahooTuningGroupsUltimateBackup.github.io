In the case of a five note chord where the lowest and highest notes are one octave apart, keep the lowest and highest notes and omit one or two of the other three notes in any combination you like. For four note chords where the lowest and highest notes are one octave apart then keep the lowest and highest notes and omit either one of the other two notes.<br/>All subsets of the chords listed here should be good. All good intervals are within plus or minus 6.776 cents (256/255) accuracy of a good JI interval.<br/>For chords less than an octave wide play each note alternately with the whole chord and the note that sounds most similar to the chord is the key of the chord.</p><p>For more on Blue Temperament and how I worked it out go to<br/><a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">http://www.johnsmusic7.com</a><br/>and click on the region you live in.

The scale I gave does the 9-limit stuff much more accurately, and also does 13/7 more accurately but has only two instead of three 13/7s inside of the specified bounds. All of this leads me to suspect you have not really found the minimax tuning for your target intervals. That could be done, or with greater ease,  least squares optimum could be found.</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2010 2:39:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks John!</p><p>On Sun, Nov 28, 2010 at 3:09 PM, john777music &lt;<a href="mailto:jfos777@yahoo.com">jfos777@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s my Blue Temperament tuning again but this time with a list of good<br/>&gt; chords that are an octave or less wide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BT in cents...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0.0c, 121.6c, 200.7c, 313.5c, 388.4c, 501.2c, 580.4c,<br/>&gt; 702.0c, 816.9c, 889.4c, 1012.5c, 1085.1c, 1200c.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BT in frequencies...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.0, 1.072740, 1.122938, 1.198533, 1.25153, 1.335782,<br/>&gt; 1.398289, 1.5, 1.602938, 1.671566, 1.794724, 1.871563, 2.0.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Adjustments...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1st note 0.0 cents<br/>&gt; 2nd note +21.6 cents<br/>&gt; 3rd note +0.7 cents<br/>&gt; 4th note +13.5 cents<br/>&gt; 5th note -11.6 cents<br/>&gt; 6th note +1.2 cents<br/>&gt; 7th note -19.6 cents<br/>&gt; 8th note +2.0 cents<br/>&gt; 9th note +16.9 cents<br/>&gt; 10th note -10.6 cents<br/>&gt; 11th note +12.5 cents<br/>&gt; 12th note -14.9 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; List of good chords if tonic (1/1) is E...<br/>&gt; Use fixed width font.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E1 F#1 A#1 C1<br/>&gt; E1 F#1 A#1 D1<br/>&gt; E1 F#1 B1 D1<br/>&gt; E1 G1 A#1 C1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 G1 A#1 C#1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 G1 A#1 D1<br/>&gt; E1 G1 B1 D1<br/>&gt; E1 G1 B1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 G#1 B1 D1<br/>&gt; E1 G#1 B1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 G#1 C1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 G#1 C#1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 A1 B1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 A1 C1 E2<br/>&gt; E1 A1 C#1 E2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F1 G#1 B1 D1 F2<br/>&gt; F1 G#1 B1 D#1 F2<br/>&gt; F1 G#1 B1 E2<br/>&gt; F1 G#1 C1 D#1 F2<br/>&gt; F1 G#1 C1 E2<br/>&gt; F1 A1 B1 D#1 F2<br/>&gt; F1 A1 B1 E2<br/>&gt; F1 A1 C1 D#1 F2<br/>&gt; F1 A1 C1 E2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; F#1 A#1 C1 D#1 F#2 *<br/>&gt; F#1 A#1 D1 F#2<br/>&gt; F#1 B1 D1 F#2<br/>&gt; F#1 B1 D#1 F#2<br/>&gt; F#1 A#1 C1 F#2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt; F#1 A#1 D#1 F#2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt; F#1 C1 D#1 F#2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G1 A#1 C1 E2 G2 *<br/>&gt; G1 A#1 C#1 E2 G2 **<br/>&gt; G1 A#1 D1 G2<br/>&gt; G1 B1 D1 G2<br/>&gt; G1 B1 E2 G2<br/>&gt; G1 A#1 C1 G2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt; G1 A#1 E2 G2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt; G1 C1 E2 G2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt; G1 A#1 C#1 G2 (subset of **)<br/>&gt; G1 A#1 E2 G2 (subset of **)<br/>&gt; G1 C#1 E2 G2 (subset of **)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G#1 B1 D1 F2 G#2<br/>&gt; G#1 B1 D1 F#2<br/>&gt; G#1 B1 D1 G#2<br/>&gt; G#1 B1 D#1 F2 G#2<br/>&gt; G#1 B1 D#1 F#2<br/>&gt; G#1 B1 E2 F#2<br/>&gt; G#1 B1 E2 G#2<br/>&gt; G#1 C1 D#1 F2<br/>&gt; G#1 C1 D#1 F#2<br/>&gt; G#1 C1 E2 F#2<br/>&gt; G#1 C#1 E2 G#2<br/>&gt; G#1 C#1 F2 G#2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A1 B1 D#1 F2<br/>&gt; A1 B1 E2 G2<br/>&gt; A1 C1 D#1 F2 A2<br/>&gt; A1 C1 D#1 G2<br/>&gt; A1 C1 D#1 A2<br/>&gt; A1 C1 E2 G2<br/>&gt; A1 C1 E2 A2<br/>&gt; A1 C1 F2 A2<br/>&gt; A1 C#1 E2 G2<br/>&gt; A1 C#1 E2 A2<br/>&gt; A1 C#1 F2 A2<br/>&gt; A1 D#1 F2 A2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A#1 C1 D#1 F#2 A#2<br/>&gt; A#1 C1 D#1 G2 A#2<br/>&gt; A#1 C1 E2 F#2 A#2<br/>&gt; A#1 C1 E2 G2 A#2<br/>&gt; A#1 C#1 E2 G2 A#2<br/>&gt; A#1 D1 F#2<br/>&gt; A#1 D1 G2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B1 D1 F2 G#2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 D1 F#2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 D1 G2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 D1 G#2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 D#1 F2 G#2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 D#1 F#2 A#2<br/>&gt; B1 D#1 F#2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 D#1 G2 A#2<br/>&gt; B1 D#1 G2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 E2 F#2 A#2<br/>&gt; B1 E2 F#2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 E2 G2 A#2<br/>&gt; B1 E2 G2 B2<br/>&gt; B1 E2 G#2 B2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C1 D#1 F2 A2 C2<br/>&gt; C1 D#1 F#2 A#2 C2<br/>&gt; C1 D#1 G2 A#2 C2<br/>&gt; C1 E2 F#2 A#2 C2<br/>&gt; C1 E2 G2 A#2 C2<br/>&gt; C1 E2 A2 C2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C#1 E2 G2 A#2 C#2<br/>&gt; C#1 E2 G2 B2<br/>&gt; C#1 E2 G#2 B2<br/>&gt; C#1 E2 G#2 C#2<br/>&gt; C#1 E2 A2 B2<br/>&gt; C#1 E2 A2 C#2<br/>&gt; C#1 E2 A#2 C#2<br/>&gt; C#1 F2 G#2 B2<br/>&gt; C#1 F2 A2 B2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D1 F2 G#2 B2 D2 *<br/>&gt; D1 F#2 B2 D2<br/>&gt; D1 G2 B2 D2<br/>&gt; D1 G2 C#2<br/>&gt; D1 G#2 C#2<br/>&gt; D1 F2 G#2 D2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt; D1 F2 B2 D2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt; D1 G#2 B2 D2 (subset of *)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D#1 F2 G#2 B2 D#2<br/>&gt; D#1 F2 G#2 C2 D#2<br/>&gt; D#1 F2 A2 B2 D#2<br/>&gt; D#1 F2 A2 C2 D#2<br/>&gt; D#1 F#2 A#2 C2 D#2<br/>&gt; D#1 F#2 B2 D#2<br/>&gt; D#1 G2 A#2 C2<br/>&gt; D#1 G2 B2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The best chords are generally those where the lowest and highest notes are<br/>&gt; exactly one octave apart and the key of these chords will in most, if not<br/>&gt; all cases, be the lowest or highest note or both.<br/>&gt; For dense chords (with four or five notes) most will sound sweeter when one<br/>&gt; or two notes are omitted.

Why not simply giving for example a table of the 12 fifths and thirds of both, like for any temperament ?</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2010 4:49:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Does the following help?</p><p>Blue Temperament<br/>|<br/>Step size is 100.00000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 1:&nbsp; 121.600:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:&nbsp; 100.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff. -0.216000 steps, -21.60000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 2:&nbsp; 200.700:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:&nbsp; 200.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff. -0.007000 steps, -0.70000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; 313.500:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; 300.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff. -0.135000 steps, -13.50000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 4:&nbsp; 388.400:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:&nbsp; 400.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff.&nbsp; 0.116000 steps,&nbsp; 11.60000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 5:&nbsp; 501.200:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:&nbsp; 500.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff. -0.012000 steps, -1.20000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 6:&nbsp; 580.400:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:&nbsp; 600.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff.&nbsp; 0.196000 steps,&nbsp; 19.60000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 7:&nbsp; 702.000:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:&nbsp; 700.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff. -0.020000 steps, -2.00000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 8:&nbsp; 816.900:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8:&nbsp; 800.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff. -0.169000 steps, -16.90000 cents<br/>&nbsp; 9:&nbsp; 889.400:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9:&nbsp; 900.0000 cents&nbsp;&nbsp; diff.&nbsp; 0.106000 steps,&nbsp; 10.60000 cents<br/>&nbsp;10:&nbsp; 1012.500:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:&nbsp; 1000.0000 cents&nbsp; diff. -0.125000 steps, -12.50000 cents<br/>&nbsp;11:&nbsp; 1085.100:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:&nbsp; 1100.0000 cents&nbsp; diff.&nbsp; 0.149000 steps,&nbsp; 14.90000 cents<br/>&nbsp;12:&nbsp; 1200.000:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:&nbsp; 1200.0000 cents&nbsp; diff.&nbsp; 0.000000 steps,&nbsp; 0.00000 cents<br/>Total absolute difference&nbsp; :&nbsp; 1.251000 steps,&nbsp; 125.10000 cents<br/>Average absolute difference:&nbsp; 0.104250 steps,&nbsp; 10.42500 cents<br/>Root mean square difference:&nbsp; 0.127465 steps,&nbsp; 12.74654 cents<br/>Highest absolute difference:&nbsp; 0.216000 steps,&nbsp; 21.60000 cents</p><p>On Thu, Dec 2, 2010 at 6:42 AM, jacques.dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Why not showing what it changes in comparison with the &quot;Blue Just tuning&quot;, whose structure remains unchanged ?
