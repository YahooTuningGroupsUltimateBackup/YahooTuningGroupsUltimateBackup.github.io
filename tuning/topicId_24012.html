The Tartini Fokker system requires only 4<br/>new symbols rather than 6 (the sharp-and-a-half and flat-and-a-half being<br/>transparent shorthand and not really necessary).</p><p>See <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/fokkerpb.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/fokkerpb.html</a> for examples of the<br/>symbols.</p><p>I prefer the Tartini 1/4-tone symbols to Sims&apos; because the Tartini symbols<br/>_look_ like half of a sharp symbol and some kind of a flat.</p><p>Can you enlighten me?</p><p>-------------------<br/>Ted kindly replied:<br/>-------------------<br/>As a performer, I worked with Ratios (Partch), Ben Johnston&apos;s lattice, and<br/>various combinations of hooks and arrows. In my experience, Ezra&apos;s notation<br/>was the most direct and accurate extension of &quot;normal&quot; notation based on<br/>the ubiquitous ET tuning we all learn as string players in school.</p><p>None of the symbols are combined with anything other than sharps or flats,<br/>they behave like normal accidentals, that is, they hold through a measure<br/>unless cancelled or replaced.</p><p>There are no chains of accidentals, which is the reason for the 1/6 tone,<br/>otherwise, you could have some construction that would be 1/4 + 1/12 sharp<br/>something and double dotted to boot...it would take three feet of paper to<br/>describe the pitch and its duration.</p><p>There is the issue of high speed reading: The Tartini single stroke sharp,<br/>double stroke sharp and triple stroke sharp, at music stand distance, in<br/>crummy light become indistinguishable without careful scrutiny.<br/>-----------------------</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div>
