I&apos;ve had a &apos;conversation&apos; with Paul Erlich off-line, and he<br/>assures me I missed the boat by a small ocean. I&apos;m sorry to have<br/>caused such a ruckus, and certainly had no intent of casting<br/>aspersions on Paul himself.</p><p>I&apos;ll just leave it at that.</p><p>Jon</p></div>
