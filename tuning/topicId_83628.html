Young apparently published just one article and died before writing a promised 2nd one on &quot;sectional sixths&quot; and 36-tet. So, AFAIK, he did nothing with 36-EDO except speculate. He wrote a little more about 24-tet-- he proposed scales generated by cycles of the half-fourth (250 cents) and half-fifth (350 cents) and IIRC, 10 and 14 tone scales in 24 consisting of two cycles of the pentatonic and diatonic scales compressed into one octave. Examples of these would be 3 2 3 2 2 3 2 3 2 2 and 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 in 24-tet. These are not MOS in 24 and resemble Messiaen&apos;s modes of limited transposition in concept. Alas, I&apos;ve mislaid my xerox copy of his article and it wasn&apos;t widely distributed (I saw one from the Stanford University music library).</p><p>--John</p></div>
