So I thought I&apos;d try to<br/>outline the basic thinking for those who don&apos;t care to get<br/>mathematical, and sum up what we&apos;ve learned since that hasn&apos;t been<br/>done yet.</p><p>There is a long history of theorists whose work anticipates these<br/>ideas, but for convenience I&apos;ll stick to just four: Partch and<br/>Wilson, Euler and Fokker.<br/>I invite Kraig Grady to correct any errors in what follows and<br/>provide an alternative viewpoint should he so desire.</p><p>Somewhere between Partch&apos;s &quot;One-Footed Bride&quot; graph and his numerical<br/>theories, Partch enunciated a theory of consonance. It seems to be<br/>the perfect way of applying psychoacoustics to the problem of<br/>intervals in an octave-repeating tuning system. That is, if trying to<br/>decide what set of pitches you want, given that they will repeat<br/>every 2:1 octave, Partch gives you the measure of consonance to use.</p><p>Partch&apos;s conception of &quot;tonality&quot; was that one pitch was at the<br/>center of all the consonances, i. e. it should be accompanied by all<br/>the pitches consonant with it. This concept, married to his<br/>consonance model, bears child in the form of the Tonality Diamond<br/>scales.</p><p>Erv Wilson showed how Partch&apos;s scales could be geometrically<br/>depicted, with the tonic lying in the center of a fantastically<br/>symmetrical shape. Erv&apos;s constructions relied on a concept called the<br/>lattice: every pitch in a JI tuning system can be mapped to a point<br/>in space (sometimes higher-dimensional space), such that its nearest<br/>neigbors are the pitches most consonant with it.</p><p>Erv Wilson also created new scales which were the perfect theoretical<br/>complement to Partch&apos;s Tonality Diamonds. Rather than containing one<br/>central pitch, the new scales put every note in the scale in an equal<br/>position, each sharing an equal number of consonances with its<br/>neighbors. Yet there is no &quot;space&quot; in the lattice into which any<br/>central (or more central) pitch could be inserted. He called these<br/>scales &quot;CPS scales&quot;. Very mathematical.</p><p>Getting back to Partch, Partch realized that his Tonality Diamond,<br/>though symmetrically centered in the lattice, had some<br/>melodic &quot;holes&quot; in it when ordered as an ascending or descending<br/>scale. Thus he added some extra pitches to his scale, which partook<br/>of about as many strong consonances as possible in the expanded scale.</p><p>Wilson, designing keyboards and instruments to play his CPS scales,<br/>found it similarly logical to fill the melodic holes in his scale<br/>with extra, consonant pitches. He thought of this process largely in<br/>terms of a closed cycle of fifths, mainly the consonant 3:2 fifths,<br/>but with a some of the fifths &quot;mutated&quot; to be more complex JI ratios,<br/>in order to accomodate the CPS scale. He used the same process when<br/>designing keyboards for Partch&apos;s scale, and doubtlessly others of<br/>which I am unaware.</p><p>Now we bring in one more theorist, Fokker. Fokker&apos;s main realization<br/>was a simple but elusive one. Fokker studied the JI lattice. He<br/>showed that by defining two or three or four (depending on the number<br/>of dimensions in the lattice) small JI intervals to be &quot;unisons&quot;, one<br/>could divide the lattice into congruent &quot;chunks&quot; each of which, as a<br/>scale:<br/>has a lot of consonant intervals (by virtue of it being a chunk);<br/>is melodically pretty smooth;<br/>provides a &quot;unison&quot; to each of the infinity of pitches in the lattice;<br/>tiles with &quot;unison&quot; copies of itself indefinitely to fill the lattice.<br/>He called these scales PBs.</p><p>Fokker created just a few PBs of his own. But we&apos;ve found that most<br/>of Wilson&apos;s scales, including his CPS scales, and nearly enough<br/>Partch&apos;s scale, actually _are_ PBs! Undoubtedly, Wilson understood<br/>the basic PB insight in many different mathematical forms. For<br/>example, the cycle of fifths in Wilson&apos;s keyboard designs can be<br/>visualized as a straight line through the infinite lattice, along the<br/>direction representing the 3:2 interval. Meanwhile, the lattice is<br/>divided into PB chunks (chunky peanut butter) sliced along the<br/>directions of the &quot;unisons&quot;. Each time the line of fifths crosses the<br/>boundary from one PB to the next, it must &quot;mutate&quot; by a &quot;unison&quot; in<br/>order to compensate for the &quot;unison&quot; pitch shift between one PB and<br/>its neighbor. Eventually, it passes through a note in a distant PB<br/>that is the &quot;image&quot; of the beginning note in the beginning PB, and<br/>the cycle is closed.</p><p>Another insight of Wilson had to do with another way of slicing the<br/>infinite lattice, not into &quot;unisonious&quot; pieces but into pieces<br/>aligned along the directions of the &quot;prime&quot; consonances (those<br/>relating a fundamental and an overtone). This construction was found<br/>by Euler centuries ago, and he called each piece a &quot;genus&quot;. Fokker<br/>extended the list of &quot;primes&quot;, much like Partch did, and the higher-<br/>dimensional &quot;genus&quot; became known as an EFG (Euler-Fokker genus).<br/>Wilson found that each of his &quot;families&quot; of CPS scales,<br/>suitably &quot;housed&quot;, would fit with no gaps into an EFG. Thus the<br/>infinite lattice could be seen as an infinite number of CPS scales,<br/>fitting together with no gaps. Or alternatively, as Carl Lumma (I<br/>think) pointed out, as an infinite number of Tonality Diamonds, with<br/>some CPSs filling the gaps.</p><p>So a PB, being a chunk of the lattice, has to contain a Tonality<br/>Diamond, a CPS scale, some of both, or parts of both. Regardless,<br/>there will generally be lots of consonant intervals. Partch (guided<br/>more by judgment than by mathematics) and Wilson carefully<br/>constructed each of their PBs to carefully fit around one Tonality<br/>Diamond or around one CPS or one EFG, with as few extra notes as<br/>possible.</p><p>(to be continued . . .)</p></div><h3><a id=23499 href="#23499">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2001 9:02:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul!<br/>    I would add the concept of Moments of Symmetry (with constant structures as resulting in much<br/>of the same material as PB) , the expansion of the Yasser/ Kornerup tree into the scale tree as<br/>applicable to music (now known as the Stern Brocot tree in math).
