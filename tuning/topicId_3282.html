While its great that Amazon stocks books by Partch<br/>&gt;&gt;et. al., I believe individuals can also purchase Genesis and other tomes<br/>&gt;&gt;from the JI network.  Perhaps I am incorrect in this notion, but I do feel<br/>&gt;&gt;it would be better to support the little guy directly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Good idea. Ive changed the links for Helmholtz and Partch to JI network<br/>&gt;store. I left Divisions linked to frog peak soas they could get a plug too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;dante<br/>&gt;</p></div>
