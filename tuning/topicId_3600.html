The idea is to narrow each perfect fifth by a schisma, which is<br/>extremely close to 1/12 Pythagorean comma. Well, I just found a great<br/>article on Music Theory Online (_Algorithms for Mapping Diatonic Keyboard<br/>Tunings and Temperaments_ by Kenneth P. Scholtz) where this tuning is<br/>ascribed to Kirnberger and is called &quot;Schismatic and Syntonic Equal<br/>Temperament&quot; (after the two different possible algorithms used to create<br/>it).</p></div>
