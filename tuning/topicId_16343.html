(That is when he actually did notate his<br/>music at all, and when the tuning he dealt with was amenable to<br/>traditional notation.)  That is, in cases where you would often call for<br/>a bass clef, he would sometimes use a two-octave-down treble clef<br/>instead, or an octave-down treble clef in place of alto clef.</p><p>I&apos;m beginning to see more value in that than I realized originally.<br/>It&apos;s a long story as to why, but it basically stems from practicing Bach<br/>&apos;cello suites on my baritone saxophone.  Usually I use the little trick<br/>about imagining in three sharps or out three flats and then pretending<br/>that it&apos;s a treble clef, but there are cases where there are too many<br/>low Cs (concert pitch), and my baritone doesn&apos;t have a low A (notated)<br/>to match that pitch.</p><p>Anyway, that got me to thinking that eventually, since I realize my<br/>microtonal music on my WX-11 saxophone-style MIDI controller, perhaps<br/>it&apos;s time to learn to routinely play bass clef on it.  That lets me play<br/>it in notated pitch, where I can play that low C.  But I&apos;m beginning to<br/>think that that&apos;s a lot of work for nothing.</p><p>Despite the common perspective that traditional notation is<br/>instrument-independent, that&apos;s only true on the surface.  Ultimately,<br/>the fingering you form for a note has to be automatic.  Knowing the<br/>names of the notes is worthless in itself;  the notes (and entire<br/>figures, preferably) on their respective places in the staff have to<br/>subconsciously and automatically be associated directly with a<br/>fingering.  That requirement inherently then ties a given instrument (or<br/>fingering system at least) to a clef.  That immediate, automatic<br/>association takes time to develop for another clef.</p><p>Now I could attempt to come up with some sort of mode switch in my mind,<br/>and spend the time to build that instantaneous association on the bass<br/>clef.  &quot;Ah, this is bass clef, so flip the switch over to bass clef&quot; and<br/>the draw from all new experience I don&apos;t have in making that<br/>association.  But that&apos;ll take time to make automatic, and I&apos;ll have to<br/>a whole lot of mental wrist-slapping everytime I finger G for a note on<br/>the B line.  That or my mind whips out a bassoon fingering from my<br/>high-school days and attempts to realize it on the saxophone!</p><p>And then there&apos;s alto and tenor clef;  should I burn year to develop<br/>another setting for that mode switch in my head for them?</p><p>Waddaya folks think?

Today is my birthday, and my present was a<br/>Yamaha WX5 wind controller and VL70-m tone generator! :-) I&apos;m a flute player<br/>(treble clef only) and it&apos;s been so long since I played that I&apos;m essentially<br/>a beginner. I spent about an hour fooling around with the device as shipped<br/>(saxophone-style mouthpiece, saxophone-style fingerings in a single octave<br/>with octave-shift buttons for the left thumb). Being a flute player, that<br/>thumb wants to do B and B flat things :-). Right now, microtones are far<br/>from my mind -- learning a completely bogus set of fingerings is occupying<br/>most of my bandwidth. I&apos;ll consider a three-octave C major scale a major<br/>achievement.</p><p>Moving on to the VL70-m, some of the built-in voices are quite impressive.<br/>I&apos;m not sure how many of them I&apos;d use in, say, a jazz setting. Sadly, the<br/>&quot;expert editor&quot; one can use to tailor-make voices is only available for<br/>Macintosh, not Windows (remind me to slap Yamaha around a bit with a large<br/>trout for that!) Eventually I&apos;ll figure out the interface and write my own<br/>code, assuming I can&apos;t do what I want to do with the front panel editor.</p><p>&gt; Despite the common perspective that traditional notation is<br/>&gt; instrument-independent, that&apos;s only true on the surface.

That immediate, automatic<br/>&gt; association takes time to develop for another clef.</p><p>My recollection is that every band teacher I ever had could do it, including<br/>one who was a violinist :-). It&apos;s just a matter of practice, I suspect.</p><p>&gt; Waddaya folks think?  Are bass, tenor, and alto clefs dead for all-new<br/>&gt; music - music in tunings that have no required compatibility with<br/>&gt; history and won&apos;t be realized on instruments already tied to those<br/>&gt; clefs?</p><p>I guess for electronic digital instruments, one only has to learn one set of<br/>scales, and make the machine do all the transposition. The VL70-m can in<br/>fact transpose plus or minus 24 semitones if I recall correctly. So<br/>presumably one can write and play in whatever clefs are easiest; for a<br/>keyboard player I suspect then traditional treble and bass would be ideal,<br/>for flute players the treble clef, and so on.<br/>--<br/>M.

It does have pitch bend, however, so can<br/>easily be microtuned &quot;on the fly&quot;. The VL70-m also allows transposition plus<br/>or minus two octaves in semitone steps, although I don&apos;t know yet whether /<br/>how one can control this with MIDI on the fly. The WX5 controller has a<br/>pitch bend wheel and one of the playing modes, the default as shipped, also<br/>gets pitch bend data from the tightness of the player&apos;s lips against the<br/>&quot;reed&quot; in the mouthpiece. When I get to the point where I&apos;m ready to drive<br/>the VL70-m from a computer, I&apos;m planning on using pitch bends.</p><p>The manual I have is essentially the same as the PDF you have from the web<br/>site. However, there is another manual that comes with the VL70-m called the<br/>List Book. All of the gory details and hard coded stuff is in that book. I<br/>haven&apos;t had a chance to get involved at that level yet; right now, as I<br/>noted before, I&apos;m trying to get up to speed on the WX5 so I can perform some<br/>simple music in public without totally embarrassing myself.</p><p>&gt; And my question is whether it&apos;s worth the practice.  My immediate<br/>&gt; guess would be that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; probably not.</p><p>I&apos;m trying very hard not to agree with you, given the transposition<br/>capabilities of the VL70-m. In theory I could learn to play really well in<br/>one key (most likely F, I think) and just push-button my way into everything<br/>else. It may come to that, but I want to at least pretend I haven&apos;t lost all<br/>the skills I had in college band those many decades ago (1959 if you must<br/>know :-).</p><p>&gt; Let me clarify my concern in this regard.

I haven&apos;t even begun to attempt to recover my flute sight-reading<br/>skills yet. Most of the time when I was in band, I learned the parts from<br/>the music slowly at home, then just played them from memory in performance.<br/>There really isn&apos;t a good way for a marching flute player to carry his music<br/>in a football game; neither of the common devices worked really well for me<br/>so I just memorized the music. Marching band flute parts aren&apos;t that<br/>difficult; the trumpets and saxophones get the good parts because they&apos;re<br/>louder :-). Anyway, it kept me out of ROTC. :-)</p><p>&gt; Now, if it&apos;s something like slow scalar passages in fairly<br/>&gt; regular rhythm in alto clef, then<br/>&gt; heck, no problem, but if we&apos;re talking about 16ths that skip all<br/>&gt; over the place at allegro<br/>&gt; tempo with every other note being an accidental, it seems like a<br/>&gt; lot of work to reprogram<br/>&gt; myself to be able to do that in other than a familiar clef for<br/>&gt; whatever instrument I&apos;m<br/>&gt; playing.  That&apos;s difficult enough as it is even in the normal<br/>&gt; clef for a given instrument!</p><p>Well, yes ... I don&apos;t know of a single famous violinist who would give a<br/>piano recital, even though he or she most probably *can* play a piano to<br/>some extent and can read piano music. And I can&apos;t think of any famous<br/>classical soloist other than Edgar Meyer, Evelyn Glennie and James Galway<br/>that plays anything other than a violin or a piano. We&apos;re all specialists<br/>... there&apos;s nothing wrong with that. But I suspect it&apos;s worth spending some<br/>time outside one&apos;s comfort zone. For me the comfort zone is playing C flute<br/>by ear with amateur musicians ... folk and jazz. I&apos;m hardly likely to<br/>encounter a microtonalist doing that, nor will I ever become rich and famous<br/>at it. But I&apos;d sure like to be able to use the pitch bends on the WX5 in<br/>real time, to be able to play in keys other than F and D minor and to get<br/>higher octaves without needing a foot controller.
