It works in rank-2, so that&apos;s<br/>pretty simple.</p><p>One of the main selling points of this approach is that existing music<br/>notation doesn&apos;t temper out 128/125, because it distinguishes between<br/>C# and Db. The only problem is that MIDI itself does temper out<br/>128/125, which is a huge pain. Furthermore, lots of existing music<br/>also tempers out 128/125, which also causes some problems with this<br/>approach.</p><p>One option might be to generalize the rank-2 transformations to rank-1<br/>ones; to turn the temperament that eliminates both 81/80 and 128/125<br/>into the temperament that eliminates both 135/128 and 128/125 - which<br/>is to say to turn 12-EDO into 9-EDO. Or, you could turn the<br/>temperament that eliminates both 81/80 and 648/625 into the one<br/>eliminating 135/128 and 648/625, which is 16-equal. etc.</p><p>Has anyone worked out a method in which this might be done? What gets<br/>me is that in one sense, it seems like the most mathematically &quot;pure&quot;<br/>way to do it would be to just map 1\12 to 1\9 and say harmony be<br/>damned, but if you do so then even the octaves get screwed up, so<br/>that&apos;s certainly less than ideal - if nothing else, the concept of an<br/>&quot;EDO&quot; at -least- suggests a mapping for 2/1. Might there be some<br/>clever approach to this problem I&apos;m not seeing?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100118 href="#100118">ðŸ”—</a>domeofatonement &#x3C;domeofatonement@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2011 1:37:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Has anyone worked out a method in which this might be done?

But the more I think<br/>about it the more I realize that the whole concept doesn&apos;t make any<br/>sense. If I&apos;m treating everything as being on the spiral of fifths,<br/>then it doesn&apos;t matter whether or not a dyad comes closer to 5/4 or<br/>6/5, so it doesn&apos;t matter whether 128/125 vanishes or not. The<br/>equivalent would be to make 108/125 vanish, so that three -minor-<br/>thirds gives you the octave. As you might expect, 108/125 vanishing<br/>and 135/128 vanishing leads to the 12c mapping, where 5/1 is mapped to<br/>27\12 instead of 28\12 (the &lt;12 19 27| val). So much for that.</p><p>I know that Gene has somehow managed to work out a full translation of<br/>every temperament to every other one, so I was hoping he could perhaps<br/>give some insight into the rank-1 case; if the approach is basically<br/>just to map 1\x to 1\y, or if there&apos;s a more elegant solution I&apos;m not<br/>thinking of.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100127 href="#100127">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2011 8:50:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jun 15, 2011 at 11:10 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know that Gene has somehow managed to work out a full translation of<br/>&gt; every temperament to every other one, so I was hoping he could perhaps<br/>&gt; give some insight into the rank-1 case; if the approach is basically<br/>&gt; just to map 1\x to 1\y, or if there&apos;s a more elegant solution I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; thinking of.</p><p>Hey, here&apos;s something stupidly obvious that I didn&apos;t think of at all:<br/>If both of them are augmented temperaments, then you can map<br/>everything as an augmented temperament. I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t<br/>consider that. The problem is that there&apos;s going to be an infinite<br/>number of ways to map every interval - in 12-equal, C-D could be 0<br/>period, 2 generators, or it could be 1 period, -2 generators, or it<br/>could be 2 periods, -6 generators. This is the case because 12 is also<br/>a meantone temperament. I&apos;m not immediately sure how the translation<br/>into mavila would work.</p><p>Perhaps we can obtain two mappings for each 12-tet interval - the<br/>shortest path(s) to the interval via the meantone mapping, and then<br/>the shortest path(s) to the interval by the augmented mapping, and use<br/>the combination of that data somehow to work out the proper 9-TET<br/>mapping when you change the first one to mavila.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
