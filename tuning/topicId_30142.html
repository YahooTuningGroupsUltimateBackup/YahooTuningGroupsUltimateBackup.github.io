His two- and three-part inventions never venture into the<br/>&gt; remote keys that this work does. Instead the key signatures look<br/>&gt; suspiciously like they accomodate some kind of regular, open meantone<br/>&gt; temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Admittedly, he could have done this out of deference to tuning<br/>&gt; practice in the wider musical world around him, but I wonder why<br/>&gt; you&apos;re so adamant about the exclusivity of his commitment to<br/>&gt;</p><p>It was not so much to showcase, as to show their usability.  Yes, all the<br/>diatonic keys reflect a meantone.  Only, Werckmeister chromatic mirrors sixth<br/>comma meantone...which is, significantly, what his organ builder preferred<br/>(Silbermann).  And the argument is already being made for 1/6th comma<br/>meantone for Telemann, Bach&apos;s friend.  My thesis is that Werckmeister<br/>chromatic already accounts for full usage for all of music, requiring only<br/>the picking and choosing of instrument with circumstance and practicality of<br/>execution.</p><p>Really, I have listened and performed in a myriad of tunings.  I have no axe<br/>to grind with this.  In my Masters thesis (published in PITCH I:2) I wrote on<br/>Bach&apos;s Tuning, preferring not to claim anything definitive, except the<br/>POSSIBILITY that the composer might not be in equal temperament.

I still refer to what I view as the practical reality of<br/>fudging, conscious or not, or even plain old-fashioned intonational<br/>fallibility that real, everyday musicians, including professionals of<br/>high order, exhibit (I think to some degree inevitably), unless they<br/>are scrupulously trained to respect with a high degree of<br/>impeccability the particular tuning system in question. I don&apos;t see<br/>this latter possibility as a very realistic assumption to make about<br/>any period, no matter which composer is under consideration.</p><p>Further, Leopold Mozart&apos;s using enharmonics that theoretically<br/>violate his own teaching methods simply means to me that practical<br/>musicians recognize and exploit near identities as unison vectors<br/>when it suits their purposes. We do that here, don&apos;t we? And why not?</p><p>And why should Bach be an exception if he ever wanted to be? And why<br/>should playing the Unaccompanied Partitas and Sonatas for Violin in<br/>adaptive JI, for example, be considered other than an authentic<br/>interpretive possibility, since the neither the instrument nor the<br/>music mandate Werckmeister? Or do you think the music does, because<br/>it is either compatible with it, or because it seems to you<br/>idiomatically adapted to that specific temperament in such obvious<br/>and incontrovertible ways that it borders on criminality not to<br/>adhere to Werckmeister?</p></div>
