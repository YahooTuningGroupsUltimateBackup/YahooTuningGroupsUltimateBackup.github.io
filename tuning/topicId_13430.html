(Supposing it is<br/>one that repeats at the octave, if not, would need to give proper def.)</p><p>The mode is defined in terms of steps in the scale. The chord is defined as<br/>degrees in the mode.</p><p>The b just means go back one step in the scale. So 2b means second step in<br/>mode, i.e. 4 in scale, which prog will work out from the /mode line, then go<br/>back 1, to 3.</p><p># means go forward one step in scale</p><p>If you have<br/>/half_acc</p><p>then = means go forward one step in scale, # means go forward 2 steps,<br/> means go back one (perhaps [ would be better than | as closer to = and<br/>numbers on keyboard, and less likely to be confused with 1), and b means go<br/>back 2 steps.</p><p>They don&apos;t have to really be ordinary flats and sharps, and one can use ##=<br/>to go forward 5 steps, and so on.</p><p>So it is completely general to any mode in any scale, and scale and mode<br/>with any numbers of notes. I don&apos;t know much about what chords are used in<br/>which scales, so that&apos;s why I chose a familiar example to show the notation.</p><p>Of course one could use other notations, just suggesting a clear example to<br/>get started. Prob. best to fix on one simple notation however - then one can<br/>give a concise description of how it all works, which will be helpful for<br/>anyone wanting to add capability to browse the modes html to their program.</p><p>I&apos;ve had a number of other ideas about it - the scales could be implemented<br/>as a list rather than a drop list, with the short cut char next to the entry<br/>like this:<br/>1 major scale<br/>2 diminished seventh</p><p>so you can see what key to press to get the chord .</p><p>If there was a special chords popup window with the list, then when one is<br/>using that window (caption highlighted), one could just use the char. on its<br/>own without the Alt to play the chord. One would then only need the Alt<br/>shortcut method to add extras to the chord like inversions and<br/>transpositions.</p><p>I&apos;ve replaced the /scale_key line by /scale_html as more aptly describing<br/>it, as a key to the html. Also it could be the name for the html for the<br/>start page for those scales: say _12t.html as the start page for 12 tone<br/>scales.</p><p>Also, when transposing the chord up / down, there are 3 poss., to keep the<br/>identical pattern of steps in the mode (so major chord becomes minor chord<br/>in some positions), or keep the identical pattern of steps in the scale (so<br/>in et, chord is identical), or to keep the identical pattern of intervals<br/>between successive notes of chord (in non et scales). One could have short<br/>cuts for all three, e.g. Alt + 7i3 = play chord 7 on mode degree 3 with<br/>identical intervals and Alt + 7s3 to keep identical steps (or whatever short<br/>cut keys one likes to use for these effects).</p><p>Another thing one could add is a /time line</p><p>...(as before)<br/>/chords<br/>/degrees<br/>/time 1.5<br/>0 2 4 7 ~ major chord<br/>/time 0.4<br/>0 2b 4b 5 7 ~ diminished seventh</p><p>= immediately after loading the file, play the major chord for 1.5 secnods,<br/>then the diminished seventh for 0.4 seconds.</p><p>Could be useful if one wants to demonstrate some sequence of chords. Any<br/>chords immediately prefixed with a /time entry are played immediately after<br/>file is loaded, any others are simply added to drop list without being<br/>played.</p><p>Could also define an order for the /time entries, in case one wants the drop<br/>list to be ordered in some other way from the time order:<br/>/time 0.4<br/>/time_order 2<br/>0 2 4 7 ~ major chord<br/>/time 0.4<br/>/time_order 1<br/>0 2b 4b 5 7 ~ diminished seventh</p><p>= play diminished seventh first, then major chord.</p><p>I could set up FTS as an example browser easily by adding an extra window to<br/>show the chords, and option to place it on top, keep the chords window quite<br/>small, and hide the main FTS window.</p><p>Could just look something like this:<br/>Scales<br/>(drop list)<br/>Modes<br/>(drop list)<br/>Chords<br/>(scrollable list)<br/>Tune button (to show the chords as they are played)<br/>Configure button (for customisation, if anything like that is needed).</p><p>In FTS, tune button would bring up the FTS Tune... window to show the chords<br/>as they are played - it&apos;s fairly basic, just dots on a couple of staves with<br/>no treble or base clef signs (window title says whether it shows treble or<br/>base, or both), but will give some idea.</p><p>It does have a nice feature of a nudge to pitch check box, which shows lines<br/>of stave spaced exactly according to pitch, so with two line spacings, and<br/>notes positioned on the stave accuratedly vertically according to pitch, e.g<br/>a third of the way between one line and the next, or whatever is<br/>appropriate.</p><p>Also another option to show horizontal lines for the intervals of the scale<br/>(e.g. every other note, every third note, or whatever). (N.b. with this beta<br/>some time, I&apos;ll add horizontal lines for the intervals of the mode as<br/>another option).</p><p>Then could do some example html pages with chords etc., preferrably copy one<br/>from the web by someone knowledgeable about chords than to make up my own.</p><p>However I&apos;d like to hear what the Java programmers have in mind for the<br/>project first, and we haven&apos;t had anything from them yet this week.</p><p>Hope preparations are going well for that :-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=13581 href="#13581">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Alves &#x3C;ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2000 4:24:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sorry, should have had a line describing the mode as well:<br/>&gt;<br/>Perhaps I&apos;m missing something, but modes (if we restrict that term merely<br/>to the construct that can be represented as a scale) may not be definable<br/>in terms of equal temperament.
