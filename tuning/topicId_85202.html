I hope things are going well for you all.</p><p>My off topic request: Because I have known many of you for years, I suspect some of you might have downloaded some of Kenneth Jonsson&apos;s Bach renditions, which he had called &quot;Acrobatic Bach&quot;. I was very enthusiastic about him when I first heard him, and I am sure I recommended him to many of you. I have lost all my recordings of him and would love to have them again. They have disappeared completely from the Internet, and his email accounts no longer work.</p><p>If you respond to me by email, please use the address jstarret@....</p><p>Thank you all,</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
