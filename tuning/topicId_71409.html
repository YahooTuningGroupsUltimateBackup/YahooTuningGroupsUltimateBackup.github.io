The<br/>second was an imperfect cadence with G-C-B in the soprano over C-A-G<br/>in the bass: in this case he said the final major third might well be<br/>pure, as a point of rest.</p><p>So the tuning of each interval and each note *depends on the immediate<br/>musical context*. Adaptive, but not always adaptive in the direction<br/>of producing pure intervals. The easiest way to get that sort of<br/>tuning is to use several musicians playing traditional instruments.</p><p>One thing I know is that Edward Elgar (and his father before him) did<br/>a lot of piano tuning - that would have been in the 1860s onwards, and<br/>probably some by-ear method of approximating 12ET, though one would<br/>have to look at real historical evidence to see exactly what sort of<br/>method. The big Jorgensen book has some evidence, though what he says<br/>about Ellis&apos; researches is seriously flawed (basically he massages the<br/>numbers to fit his preconceptions of what a historical piano tuning<br/>ought to have been) and his &apos;Broadwood&apos; temperaments are pure fiction.</p><p>Try looking at &apos;Tuner&apos;s Guide #2&apos; or &apos;Tuner&apos;s Guide #3&apos; - based on<br/>historical instructions from 1840 and basically quite close<br/>approximations to 12ET.<br/><a href="http://rollingball.com/images/TunersGuide2.gif">http://rollingball.com/images/TunersGuide2.gif</a></p><p>Basically if you want something to sound &apos;Victorian&apos; then I can&apos;t see<br/>how temperament can be much of a factor. What you might like to<br/>consider are: timbre, use of vibrato (less) or portamento (more) in<br/>string playing, amount of octave stretch (less) in piano tuning,<br/>dichords rather than trichords, rubato ...</p><p>(Or you could go for the gambit of a randomly out-of-tune piano, which<br/>should suggest &apos;olden days&apos; in that most old pianos are indeed<br/>randomly out-of-tune due to neglect and decay... but you&apos;d have to be<br/>quite shameless.)</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve got bad news.

And for sure, any<br/>_a capella_ choir singing music based on triadic harmony<br/>and trying to make their intonation &quot;pure&quot; is going<br/>to tend to drift downward in pitch -- it&apos;s a natural<br/>result of moving from the II chord to the V chord in<br/>a major key.</p><p>However, it is also true that orchestral musicians during<br/>this period were often taught during their training that<br/>the whole-tone was to be divided into 9 &quot;commas&quot;, and<br/>that there were two different sizes of semitones: the<br/>chromatic-semitone of 4 commas, and the diatonic-semitone<br/>of 5 commas. Assuming octave-equivalence and that the<br/>octave is comprised of 5 whole-tones and 2 diatonic-semitones,<br/>that is a total of (5*9)+(2*5) = 45+10 = 55 commas per<br/>octave, which means 55-edo.</p><p>Our standard notational system uses a chain-of-5ths<br/>that runs from Gbb to Ax, which is a total of 31 different<br/>notes. So no composer during the &quot;common-practice&quot; period<br/>ever used the entire 55-edo -- only at most a 31-tone<br/>subset of it, and actually usually a far smaller subset.</p><p>I&apos;ve discovered that in every Beethoven orchestral piece<br/>that i&apos;ve so far made into a Tonescape file, he used<br/>a 15-tone set of notated pitches, with 3 pairs of<br/>enharmonic equivalents along with the 9 other individual<br/>notes -- and they all follow the same Lattice structure.<br/>This leads me to believe that there&apos;s something to this.</p><p>And i wish to emphasize one phrase i wrote above:<br/>&quot;orchestral musicians during this period were often taught<br/>during their training&quot;. As a trained musician -- but one<br/>who learned 12-edo instead of 55-edo -- i can testify to<br/>how ingrained this kind of thinking becomes. If musicians<br/>during this period were taught 55-edo, then believe me,<br/>that&apos;s what they tended to play.</p><p>Of course the &quot;expressive intonation&quot; was also taught,<br/>and that would tend to bend some pitches toward the<br/>pythagorean version of the notated pitch. So indeed<br/>the intonational system would be quite messy and chaotic,<br/>as you describe. But for this period, a 55-edo basis<br/>is far preferred to 12-edo for orchestral instruments<br/>(or their digital emulations).</p><p>In case you haven&apos;t seen it, i have a webpage about this:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/55edo/55edo.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/55edo/55edo.htm</a></p><p>It&apos;s quite sloppy and badly needs to be edited, but<br/>knowing your penchant for scholarship, i&apos;d like to<br/>direct you to the last part of it, which quotes Mozart&apos;s<br/>actual teaching of intonation, and it is indeed meantone.<br/>Altho Mozart himself never specified the 55-edo sizes<br/>in this notebook, his father Leopold did teach exactly<br/>that in his violin method.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2007 9:52:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve made the Scale .scl file for you...</p><p>Thanks so much, you are a dear.

So I am<br/>very much creating an imaginary musical situation, but one that would<br/>branch out of an actual period in history.

The very-close-to-1/6-comma<br/>meantone 5th is 71 degrees of 122, and the meantone mapping<br/>of 5 (i.e., the major-3rd) is 40 degrees -- this mapping<br/>tempers out the syntonic-comma and it really is thus a<br/>meantone tuning.

He says that some of them do too much favoring of the flat keys, and it&apos;s therefore not equal enough for him.  [NB: His complaint is theoretical, not about the musical results or the usefulness of temperaments so nuanced.]</p><p>To me, this suggests that some of those Victorian piano tuners, *using their own good taste for their customers&apos; repertoire*, were doing something sort of like:</p><p>-  1/6 to 1/8 comma 5ths among the naturals;</p><p>- having the sharps rise rapidly (maybe with several pure or nearly-pure 5ths starting somewhere around B-F#-C#ish);</p><p>- having the flats fall off with less tempering than that, around the region of C-F-Bb-Eb-Ab.  Maybe something like 1/8 to 1/12 comma, in those several 5ths generating the flats.</p><p>I&apos;ve been testing this notion, empirically, by playing a bunch of Grieg and Brahms and Joplin (et al) on our church&apos;s piano, which I&apos;ve had set up in a similar temperament for the past two years.  Tightest tempering is downtown in the naturals, and sharps rising quickly, and flats falling off less quickly.  Sure enough, it makes the keys of 1 to 6 flats sound especially mellow and &quot;favored&quot;, with a warm and rich sound.   It&apos;s barely unequal enough that an equal-temperament polemicist might notice and then complain about it.</p><p>I noticed the same type of thing (vis-a-vis key character) by taking Peter Watchorn&apos;s harpsichord recording of the WTC<br/><a href="http://www.musicaomnia.org/bachharpsichord.asp">http://www.musicaomnia.org/bachharpsichord.asp</a><br/>and burning myself a CD of only the preludes, rearranged to be in circle-of-5ths order.  Whenever we get to the music in flats, going around the circle in either direction, the instrument sounds warmest and gentlest.</p><p>That circle of 5ths, in Heinichen&apos;s formulation from 1728:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/heinichen-circle.gif">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/heinichen-circle.gif</a></p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2007 11:25:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; In this olden book from c1908 (IIRC - a cheap Dover paperback reprint<br/>&gt; that my local library has),<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Piano-Tuning-Simple-Accurate-Amateurs/dp/0486232670">http://www.amazon.com/Piano-Tuning-Simple-Accurate-Amateurs/dp/0486232670</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the author presses the model of equal temperament, done by ear,<br/>&gt; obviously...but an interesting remark (to me) is that he has a<br/>complaint<br/>&gt; against some of the other contemporary tuners.
