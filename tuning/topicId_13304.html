He does this by tuning it to 12t-<br/>ET then detuning the lowest bass strings and tuning the highest<br/>melody strings sharp.  For reference he has been using a stretch-<br/>tuning chart for the Fender Rhodes at:</p><p><a href="http://www.fenderrhodes.org/rhodes/manual/fig5-4.gif">http://www.fenderrhodes.org/rhodes/manual/fig5-4.gif</a></p><p>Because the frets are equally spaced to 12t-ET, he has to compromise<br/>by detuning his bass strings to some middle cents value between the<br/>recommended offset from 12t-ET for the lowest note on the string and<br/>the recommended offset for the highest note he is going to use on<br/>that string.  He is using 3 cents as a fudge factor as he doesn&apos;t<br/>hear a difference for adjustments of 3 cents or less.</p><p>I asked him why he is going through all this trouble and he said that<br/>there are two main issues:</p><p>1. By himself he perceives the lowest and highest strings as being<br/>out of tune.  For example, he doesn&apos;t like the 3rds, perceiving them<br/>as being too flat.</p><p>2. Without the pseudo stretch tuning he finds himself out of tune<br/>with his dual-guitarist (a guy who plays dual guitars using pianistic<br/>tapping).  The guitarist is also tuning to 12t-ET via tuner and<br/>making fine tuning adjustments afterwards to one or more strings.</p><p>I suggested to him that one or more of the following is going on:</p><p>1. Guitars are out of tune in relation to Stick.<br/>2. Stick intonation and other setup parameters (truss rod, etc.) are<br/>messed up.<br/>3. He and the guitarist are both starting to hear the out-of-tuneness<br/>of 12t-ET.</p><p>We sort of eliminated #1 in that he and the guitarist do in fact use<br/>the same tuner when recording.  #2 cannot be verified either way as I<br/>am not there to check out his Stick.  Quite frankly, he has far more<br/>guitar and Stick experience than I do, especially professional<br/>gigging and recording, so he probably does not suffer from #2.</p><p>Which leaves #3.  I imagine the prospect of abandoning 12t-ET must<br/>frighten my friends, having played that domain literally since<br/>childhood.  Is this pseudo stretch-tuning a workable compromise, at<br/>least until they work up the courage to switch to something like 31t-<br/>ET? :)</p><p>Is stretch tuning a form of meantone, well temperament, or neither?</p><p>Look forward to your help,<br/>Paolo</p></div><h3>a440a@aol.com</h3><span>9/22/2000 2:41:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paolo asks:<br/>&gt;&gt;Is stretch tuning a form of meantone, well temperament, or neither? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Greetings,<br/>    &quot;Stretch&quot; is the term given for the cumulative effect of tuning octaves<br/>one from another.  The upper partials of a vibrating string are slightly<br/>higher than their ideal ratios would have it, so the upper string of an<br/>octave is tuned by syncronizing its fundamental with the second partial of<br/>the lower note.  This partial, being slightly higher than double the<br/>fundamental, causes the upper note of the octave to be slightly sharper than<br/>double the lower note.  As you accumulate octaves, the effect increases.<br/>   On a Steinway D, C88 is approx.  38 cents sharper than the mathematical<br/>exact placement.<br/>   The same phenomenom causes the bass strings on a piano to get increasingly<br/>flatter in regards to absolute octaves.  Studio musicians usually use an<br/>electronic tuner without knowing what stretch is. I tune the bass sharp<br/>enough to quell the bass players griping, but not so sharp that I lose my<br/>reinforcement.<br/>   The temperaments are an entirely different matter,(though the Steinway<br/>Hall tuners tend toward sharping the first octave out of the middle, creating<br/>a pure fifths temperament with a lot of stretch.  The thirds and octaves<br/>begin to sound pretty &quot;active&quot; with this tuning, though the fifths are really<br/>clean.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 2:21:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow!

Meantones and well-temperaments are both<br/>UDO - &apos;unequally divided 8ve&apos;.</p><p>Stretch tunings are generally *non-&apos;8ve&apos;*, because all intervals,<br/>including the &apos;8ves&apos;, are stretched.</p><p>They can be equal-temperaments (EDNO - &apos;equally-divided non-8ve&apos;,<br/>as in the upcoming post I&apos;ll be sending next), based on dividing<br/>some other interval instead of the 2/1; or they can be unequal<br/>(UDNO - &apos;unequally divided non-8ve&apos;, as in most recommended<br/>piano tunings, which are close to 12-tET near &apos;middle-C&apos;, but<br/>diverge farther and farther away as they approach the extremes<br/>of the keyboard.</p><p>I suppose it&apos;s possible that a stretch tuning could also be<br/>a UDO - &apos;unequally divided 8ve&apos;, but that doesn&apos;t seem to work<br/>to me.  ...?</p><p>Stretch tunings seem to work especially well on pianos, because<br/>the piano timbre has stretched harmonics.  There are specific<br/>recommended stretch tunings programmed into the expensive<br/>electronic piano-tuners for specific brands and models of<br/>pianos, based on that particular instrument&apos;s timbre.</p><p>(I don&apos;t know the details - more knowledgeable - and I would<br/>presume more affluent - piano tuners on the list will have<br/>to comment.)</p><p>I made a webpage last year exploring some ideas Charles Ives<br/>had about using stretch tunings based on 48-tET (&apos;1/8-tones&apos;):<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ives/48tet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ives/48tet.htm</a></p><p>These were stretched more than any other I&apos;ve ever seen; in<br/>other words, Ives was not looking for something approaching<br/>perceived consonance, as in most other stretch tunings; he<br/>was simply looking for a very different-sounding scale which<br/>still exhibited the tetrachordal properties familiar from the<br/>12-tET diatonic scale.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 7:58:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13318">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13318</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I made a webpage last year exploring some ideas Charles Ives<br/>&gt; had about using stretch tunings based on 48-tET (&apos;1/8-tones&apos;):<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ives/48tet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/ives/48tet.htm</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>Wow.

(??)</p><p>Joe, I think Dan Stearns hit the nail right on the head with<br/>his comments here:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13339">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13339</a></p><p>Ives was railing against: the *complacency* of simply accepting<br/>low-integer JI because of its consonance and *ruling out*<br/>other types of intervals.</p><p>He was interested in an expansion of pitch resources, and<br/>certainly wanted dissonant relationships and structures to<br/>deal with, to accomodate new musical gestures he wanted to<br/>put into his compositions.</p><p>Except for the stretched Pythagorean scale I present at the end<br/>of my webpage, all other scales *do* contain logarithmic steps,<br/>because they&apos;re all based on ETs.</p><p>The important point, which I mention in the webpage but perhaps<br/>didn&apos;t stress strongly enough, is that these scales all exhibit<br/>the same kind of tetrachordal similarity that is familiar to<br/>&apos;academic&apos; Euro-centric music and theory.  Ives&apos;s point was that<br/>even tho the actual pitches are weird (to someone familiar only<br/>with 12-tET/JI/meantone), the *structure* of the scales is<br/>easily recognizable, which thus makes them useful for his<br/>compositional purposes.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
