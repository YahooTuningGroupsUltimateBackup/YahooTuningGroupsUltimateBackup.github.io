This seems obvious, yet I don&apos;t encounter the same<br/>desire too much in the rest of the literature. I myself feel the need to<br/>allow my ear to partake in the journey to understand all these concepts.<br/>I&apos;ve been working with Scala, and I have a program which  generates scala<br/>programs to create midi output of ratios I want to hear.</p><p>That&apos;s all nice, you say, but what is my point?<br/>I&apos;m hoping you can answer this question for me, since I do not have a<br/>&quot;science&quot; background. Is there a physical property involved in deciding how<br/>LONG an interval should be heard for the ear to comfortably get used to it?<br/>In other words, can I accelerate the process at all by hearing ratios at<br/>certain lengths of time? 3 seconds? 15 seconds? is there a difference ?</p><p>Also, should I  always include the 1/1?</p><p>-Ara S.</p></div><h3>Robert Jordahl &#x3C;jordahl321@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/1999 3:46:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Unsubscribe</p></div><h3>Sehvar Besiroglu &#x3C;besir@itu.edu.tr&#x3E;</h3><span>4/17/2003 8:01:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p></p></div>
