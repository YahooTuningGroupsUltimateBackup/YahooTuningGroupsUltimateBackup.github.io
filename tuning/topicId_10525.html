I wouldn&apos;t say they exploited the comma, only that they exploited<br/>the dissonance of the Pythagorean thirds, not knowing that future<br/>generations would use the just thirds only a comma away as consonances.</p><p>In the 1400s, when the latter were introduced, composers did exploit the<br/>felicitous closeness of the Pythagorean comma to the syntonic comma, in<br/>order to get quasi-just thirds out of Pythagorean tuning.
