Here I have in mind especially music in usual harmonic<br/>timbres, and with sustained note-against-note textures where the<br/>tuning of thirds is most aurally telling. For example:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Invocation-ToneIV.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Invocation-ToneIV.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>There are many fine points in our arguments concerning<br/>counterpoint rules and the like, and these are both rewarding and<br/>delightful to explore.</p><p>However, to keep this dialogue musically concrete, I would like<br/>to start with these example, some of them rather &quot;xenharmonic&quot; in<br/>16th-century or early 17th-century terms, but all of them in my<br/>view calling, in usual harmonic timbres, for meantone (or<br/>possibly adaptive 5-limit JI) rather than Pythagorean or wider<br/>major thirds.</p><p>In my view, a main barrier to the enjoyment of Pythagorean and<br/>related tunings is that people are often unfamiliar with<br/>historical styles where these tunings are especially fitting and<br/>effective, and experience them mainly in other historical styles<br/>where meantone or the like is indeed more fitting, as they<br/>themselves quickly conclude through experience.</p><p>What I should emphasize is my focus on the 16th and early 17th<br/>centuries as the period when meantone is especially appropriate,<br/>leaving open both later classical European styles and new musics<br/>based on stable thirds of the kind which Jake is exploring in<br/>wide-fifth temperaments.</p><p>My replies will follow, Marcel, on some points you have raised,<br/>with thanks also for the URL to a very helpful site for<br/>converting video to MP3 audio.

Which also suggests that<br/>&gt;  (at least some) practice of 5/4 major thirds probably pre-dated the<br/>&gt;  meantone era.</p><p>While the question of whether Ramis himself may have used<br/>meantone is an interesting one, I should begin by agreeing that<br/>indeed the use of 5/4 before the meantone era is supported not<br/>only by some 13th-14th century English music, but by the<br/>schismatic Pythagorean tunings of the era around 1400 as<br/>documented by Mark Lindley.</p><p>In these tunings, for example Gb-B on a 12-note keyboard with all<br/>accidentals tuned as Pythagorean flats, diatonic thirds remain<br/>Pythagorean, but major thirds involving sharps at 8192:6561 or<br/>384 cents are very close to 5/4. In the Gb-B tuning, we have<br/>written D-F#-A, E-G#-B, and A-C#-E at a near-just 4:5:6. Lindley<br/>reasonably proposes that by around 1450, the desire to obtain as<br/>many major thirds as possible at or around 5/4 led to meantone<br/>temperament.</p><p>In his treatise of 1482, Ramis or Ramos describes not only his<br/>theoretical 5-limit monochord, but a practical 12-note keyboard<br/>for which he advocates a tuning of Ab-C#, noting that some people<br/>prefer Eb-G#. As Lindley argues, Ramis describes these tunings in<br/>a way that strongly suggests meantone rather than Pythagorean.</p><p>&gt;  However, what I do not see is a strong link between<br/>&gt;  differences in meantone and Pythagorean leading to different<br/>&gt;  music.</p><p>This is precisely what I do see, hear, and experience, and I<br/>speak as someone for whom medieval, Renaissance, and Manneristic<br/>music, together with Near Eastern styles, are my everyday musical<br/>fare.</p><p>&gt;  The music is all fifth based, and all music from the middle<br/>&gt;  ages till now functions perfectly well in Pythagorean.  And in<br/>&gt;  my opinion would have just as well been written had the<br/>&gt;  popular tuning of the 16^th century till the 20^th century<br/>&gt;  been Pythagorean instead of meantone.</p><p>Assuming harmonic timbres -- a very big assumption, but a not<br/>unlikely one, with timbre recognized as an important factor by<br/>Vincenzo Galilei in 1581! -- I must dissent from this<br/>conclusion. If William Sethares and his technologies had been<br/>available around 1400 rather than 2000, then it becomes a much<br/>more open question!</p><p>In a 13th-14th century style, 2:3:4 is the ideal concord, the<br/>point of harmonic saturation, with anything more complex seeking<br/>its sense of sonorous stability and repose. Seconds, thirds,<br/>sixths, and sevenths all serve as unstable and contrasting<br/>intervals introducing various degrees of creative tension,<br/>sometimes in very prominent and prolonged sonorities. This can be<br/>heard in Perotin and Machaut, and likewise in the rather<br/>different style of a composer such as Landini.</p><p>This 13th-century improvisation may illustrate these points:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MixolydianDiversionTE1.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MixolydianDiversionTE1.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>In a 16th-century style, the ideal is 4:5:6, or more specifically<br/>a voicing such as 2:3:4:5 or 2:4:5:6, etc. The smooth concord of<br/>5/4 is just as essential as that of 3/2 in forming this new<br/>standard of stable saturation.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Both the explicit rules and the implicit aesthetics of<br/>13th-century and 16th-century polyphony are thus radically<br/>different, although equally meritorious and beautiful!</p><p>In a 13th-century approach, we have a continual alternation and<br/>contrast between stable sonorities (ideally the complete 2:3:4,<br/>or often the simple 3:2 fifth) and unstable ones built from<br/>various interval combinations, many of which (e.g. 4:6:9) would<br/>be prohibited or drastically restricted by 16th-century rules.</p><p>In a 16th-century approach, we often have a smooth and seamless<br/>flow of saturated 4:5:6 or 10:12:15 sonorities, decorated by<br/>rather inconspicuous passing or ornamental tones, and sometimes<br/>punctuated by the telling but muted tension of suspension<br/>dissonances. That major and minor thirds, now points not of<br/>creative tension but of restful concord, be intonationally smooth<br/>and fully blending, is of the very essence!</p><p>In a style based on major/minor tonality, as in the late<br/>17th-19th centures, the situation is again different, because the<br/>level of vertical tension and contrast is again much higher than<br/>in the 16th century, although thirds and sixths remain the most<br/>complex stable intervals. Here various intonational tastes and<br/>compromises develop, including the well-temperaments used<br/>throughout this era from Werckmeister on, and styles of<br/>&quot;expressive intonation&quot; as favored by some string players from at<br/>least the 19th century on, and today by George Secor, where, for<br/>example, the major third of a dominant triad might well be<br/>Pythagorean or even larger.</p><p>[On Pythagorean (or wide-fifth) tunings as &quot;unstylish&quot;<br/>specifically in a usual 16th-century context]</p><p>&gt;  Yes agreed on &quot;unstylish&quot;. Not in an &quot;objective&quot; musical<br/>&gt;  context (as if meantone is implied by the music), but in a<br/>&gt;  historically correct context meantone is of course known to be<br/>&gt;  correct.</p><p>I would say that, assuming a harmonic timbre, meantone or<br/>something like it (e.g. classic or adaptive 5-limit JI) is<br/>implied by most 16th-century European music.</p><p>This situation is in contrast to that of the era around 1400, for<br/>example, where a classic Pythagorean tuning (e.g. Eb-G#), or a<br/>schismatic tuning (e.g. Gb-B), or meantone or 5-limit JI, or even<br/>a modern wide-fifth temperament, might all be reasonable musical<br/>choices, although history suggests some kind of Pythagorean<br/>tuning (maybe schismatic or not) as the likeliest period<br/>practice. Here&apos;s a fine rendition of such a piece in a wide-fifth<br/>temperament by Aaron Johnson:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/greygnour.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/greygnour.ogg</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  I think you may have heard them before.  2 short piano pieces,<br/>&gt;  one by Mozart and one by Mussorgsky, tuned to 12tet,<br/>&gt;  Pythagorean, 1/4-comma meantone and 17tet (in that order).</p><p>Please let me emphasize that my argument for meantone focuses<br/>specifically on a 16th-century or early 17th-century style, and<br/>these pieces are from the 18th and 19th centuries. From Lasso in<br/>the later 16th century to Mozart in the later 18th century is as<br/>long a period as from Machaut in the mid-14th century to Lasso.</p><p>In my post opening this new thread, I give some examples of music<br/>from the 16th and early 17th centuries, or composed in similar<br/>styles, where meantone seems to me the appropriate choice.</p><p>&gt;  I don&apos;t have them online in a different format.

My<br/>strong suspicion is that these sites don&apos;t support my text-based<br/>browser, or vice versa, although they do support the vast<br/>majority of current personal computers and software.</p><p>&gt;  Well I don&apos;t really see it the same as you do.<br/>&gt;  I hear Pythagorean (or 12tet even) as fitting in all music.</p><p>Interestingly, in 1581, Vincenzo Galilei as a strong advocate of<br/>12-tet, the standard tuning for the lute, sought to use it on a<br/>harpsichord as well. Although he very much wanted it to succeed,<br/>holding that it was a &quot;perfect&quot; temperament, in contrast to the<br/>&quot;defects&quot; of meantone with its augmented and diminished<br/>intervals, he found that in practice 2/7-comma meantone was more<br/>supportable on keyboards. He connected this with the different<br/>mechanisms of the lute and harpsichord -- or, in modern terms,<br/>with the brighter fifth partials on the latter instrument.</p><p>&gt;  The music itself does not determine a preference for a<br/>&gt;  different temperament to me.</p><p>For me, it is a matter of style and tuning/timbre. As John<br/>Chalmers pointed out to me sometime around 1998, Pythagorean<br/>tuning has many attractions even for music with stable major and<br/>minor thirds, but there is in many such styles the problem of the<br/>fifth partial. Adjusting the timbre can address this problem.<br/>However, here I believe that we are assuming usual harmonic<br/>timbres.</p><p>&gt;  The functioning of western music is fifth based. I see a major<br/>&gt;  third as de-constructible into 4 fifths (like a circle<br/>&gt;  progression does for instance) and so does western music.</p><p>That 4 fifths up form a major third is indeed a feature of fixed<br/>European tunings from Pythagorean to meantone to unequal<br/>circulating systems to 12-tet. And it applies to modern<br/>wide-fifth temperaments also.</p><p>However, patterns of consonance/dissonance and directed or<br/>functional progressions can change radically through the<br/>centuries. As someone who loves both 13th-14th century and<br/>16th-century cadences, this is an everyday given. In medieval<br/>music, stepwise motion in all parts is generally the most<br/>powerful. In the 16th century, there&apos;s a balance between bass<br/>motion by step, by thirds, or by fourths or fifths. In<br/>major-minor tonality of the later 17th-19th centuries, motion by<br/>fifths or fourths is most important.</p><p>&gt;  I don&apos;t see any functional change by using 5/4 major thirds,<br/>&gt;  nor does this change the music. It&apos;s simply a different<br/>&gt;  &quot;timbral color&quot; to me.</p><p>&gt; So why would some music fit meantone better than Pythagorean?</p><p>In the kinds of mostly harmonic timbres used around 1450-1600,<br/>the degree of acoustical tension in a major third becomes more<br/>than merely a fine nuance of intonation. It becomes of<br/>grammatical significance. True, 5/4 or 81/64, or for that matter<br/>14/11, is recognizable as a major third. But the tuning of that<br/>third can either reinforce or rather comically contradict the<br/>basic grammar of the counterpoint and aesthetic of the music.</p><p>The rules of classic 16th-century counterpoint privilege thirds<br/>and sixths, and impose restrictions on fifths and fourths as well<br/>as seconds and sevenths, precisely because thirds and sixths now<br/>define the very standard of &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; harmony. They<br/>are no longer points of tension, but points of rest and ideal<br/>euphony.</p><p>Whether to tune a major third at 379 cents (1/3-comma or 19-tet)<br/>or 383 cents (2/7-comma) or a pure 5/4 (1/4-comma, 5-limit JI) or<br/>1/5-comma (390 cents) are fine questions of shading which do not<br/>affect the basic grammar of the music.</p><p>Whether to tune a major third at 5/4 or at 81/64 is a distinction<br/>which makes a basic musical difference: between a restful and<br/>concordant third and an active one admirably fitting the<br/>different musical grammar of Perotin or Machaut, but<br/>contradicting that of Lasso or Palestrina -- or Gesualdo, for<br/>that matter.</p><p>&gt; But necessary, I don&apos;t see it. Meatone does give harsher sounds<br/>&gt; a more pleasant timbre than Pythagorean.</p><p>One point I would make as an advocate of Pythagorean and indeed<br/>wide-fifth tunings for much medieval music: active thirds are not<br/>so much &quot;harsh&quot; as dynamic and exciting in a musical context<br/>where they are expected to present moments of creative tension<br/>and motion, or pauses rather than more final conclusions. The<br/>problem in a 16th-century setting is that we are getting<br/>harshness in the sense of tension where smooth repose is<br/>expected.</p><p>&gt;  Can&apos;t agree with counterpoint rules though.</p><p>Just to clarify for those who may not have read our earlier<br/>discussion: you are, of course, disagreeing not with the rules<br/>themselves in different eras, but with my conclusions drawn from<br/>them :).</p><p>&gt; To me they imply the exact opposite.</p><p>&gt; The thirds and sixths are not perfect consonances in<br/>&gt; counterpoint, but specifically imperfect consonances.</p><p>True, and this terminology can be found from the 13th century at<br/>least on, but the musical implications of these terms do change.</p><p>&gt; And the rules for imperfect consonances are very different from<br/>&gt; the perfect consonances.</p><p>They are -- but in a different way during the 13th century than<br/>during the 16th century!</p><p>In the 13th-14th centuries, &quot;imperfect&quot; means &quot;partially&quot; or<br/>&quot;relatively&quot; concordant, with a considerable level of tension or<br/>instability. Thus thirds must sooner or later resolve to stable<br/>concords, with a complete 2:3:4 as the ideal destination in<br/>multi-voice writing.</p><p>By the mid-16th century, Vicentino&apos;s &quot;richness of harmony&quot; or<br/>Zarlino&apos;s &quot;perfect harmony&quot; not only permits but mandates using<br/>the new complete sonority, 4:5:6, as often as possible, typically<br/>even in closing. Thomas Morley (1597), who shows an interest in<br/>historical questions, brings up the point that it is now common<br/>to close on &quot;imperfect&quot; concords, although they are still called<br/>imperfect.</p><p>&gt; For instance: no parallel fifths or octaves allowed, but<br/>&gt; parallel thirds and sixths are fine (within reason).</p><p>But parallel fifths, and even octaves, are freely allowed in<br/>13th-century music, always with the caution that contrary motion<br/>is generally preferred, as for serious counterpoint in any era.<br/>And in the 14th century, although &quot;modern&quot; theory prohibits<br/>parallel fifths or octaves in simple two-voice writing, they<br/>remain allowed even in theory in writing for three or more<br/>voices, with practice yet freer. Banning parallel fifths and<br/>octaves would rule out many of the most common 13th-14th century<br/>cadences. To take an example from Machaut with both fifths and<br/>octaves:</p><p>       C#   A<br/>       C#   D<br/>       G#   A<br/>       E    D</p><p>This is one of the most compelling cadences, at least as I<br/>perceive it, in the history of European music! The musical<br/>grammar depends on the fact that thirds and sixths are<br/>dynamically unstable, while 2:3:4, or here 2:3:4:6, is ideally<br/>harmonious and restful. Pythagorean tuning, a temperament around<br/>704 or 705 cents, 17-EDO, George Secor&apos;s 17-WT, or a 2-3-7 JI<br/>tuning of the first sonority at 7:9:12:18 can all realize this<br/>music grammar and syntax very effectively!</p><p>If we move through two centuries to the later 16th century, then<br/>we find an often radically changed musical language, although one<br/>with certain connections to that of Machaut. Consider, for<br/>example, this beautiful progression with the outer voices<br/>expanding from octave to major tenth to twelfth:</p><p>       E    F#   G<br/>       B    D    E<br/>       G#   A    C<br/>       E    D    C</p><p>Here the motion from 4:5:6:8 to 2:3:4:5 to 2:4:5:6 is very<br/>smooth, and involves not a contrast between instability and<br/>rich stability as in Machaut, but rather a flow from one richly<br/>stable sonority to another. A common thread of the Machaut<br/>example and this is the two-voice progression in which a major<br/>third or tenth expands to a fifth or twelfth -- a progression<br/>standard in the 14th century, and still noted, for example, by<br/>Zarlino in the 16th century. But the musical meaning is quite<br/>different, calling for a difference in intonation. Meantone<br/>brings out the fully concordant quality of the thirds.</p><p>May I conclude by adding that just as the rules of counterpoint<br/>indeed change from medieval to Renaissance times, so they again<br/>change by the 18th century. The routine use of bold sonorities<br/>involving seconds and sevenths in ways which would be foreign to<br/>a conventional 16th-century style produces, as in a 13th-14th<br/>century setting, dramatic contrasts of stability/instability or<br/>consonance/dissonance which might influence intonation, together<br/>with the frequent desire for a 12-note circulating system.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;marcel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2013 1:15:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>First of all, thank you for your in depth reply!</p><p>Ill reply without quoting as my reply will become large enough already<br/>without them Im guessing ;)</p><p>Our main point of disagreement seems to be that you think 5/4 or near 5/4<br/>major thirds are implied in certain music.</p><p>And if I understand you correctly, this is in a way irrespective of the<br/>period of composition.</p><p>So were not just talking about historical correctness here but also about<br/>(near) 5/4 major thirds having a restfulness and that this is implied by<br/>the music itself.<br/>This I see very differently, and I will try to explain why.</p><p>First of all. I think tuning is first and foremost about relative pitch<br/>height (intervals) of notes.</p><p>This is often described by chords, but melody is nothing different. We judge<br/>the pitches of a melody against one another.</p><p>The difference is that in a monophonic melody the pitches do not sound at<br/>the same time. But this does not matter in my opinion.</p><p>Ill illustrate:</p><p>Play the chords C-E-G, A-C-E, D-F-A, G-B-D, C-E-G-C<br/>And now play the melody C, E, G, A, C, E, D, F, A, G, B, D, C, E, G, C</p><p>As you can hear, they express the exact same thing. To say the chord version<br/>implies something different, in tuning or otherwise, is absurd in my<br/>opinion. (not that I think you said so, just to be clear)</p><p>Or as another example, out of a polyphonic composition, you can pick out and<br/>play by itself any of the melodic lines. Doing so of course does not change<br/>the melody or its tuning, and vice versa.</p><p>I happen to have somewhat of an example of the latter online in Pythagorean<br/><a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-elgar-enigma-theme">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-elgar-enigma-theme</a></p><p>(part of Chris Vaisvils Enigma assignment:<br/><a href="http://soonlabel.com/xenharmonic/archives/884">http://soonlabel.com/xenharmonic/archives/884</a> )</p><p>Here you can hear one monophonic melodic line first and then on each<br/>repetition another melody comes in and together they form the chords.</p><p>Now of course it would make absolutely no musical sense at all to change the<br/>tuning of the melody when other melodies are introduced in counterpoint.</p><p>What I do agree with is that when one plays a chord in isolation, say C-E-G.<br/>That when one compares C-E as 5/4 and C-E as 81/64, that the 5/4 version<br/>sounds more locked, and has a timbral quality that one could describe as<br/>more restful. And this indeed most clear with harmonic timbres.</p><p>But, is this timbral lock the definition of in tune? I used to think so<br/>after the first time I played a 5/4 major third on my keyboard. And many<br/>other people will have thought the same after they first heard a 5/4 major<br/>third.</p><p>Since that experience I started listening for this timbral lock in music and<br/>used it as my identifier of whether that music was in tune or not.</p><p>But after many years of research, experimenting and comparing tunings etc, I<br/>have come to very different ideas about what makes music in tune.</p><p>Ill refer back to the melodies vs chords example I wrote about above. I<br/>find that the 5/4 major third sounds too low to me when I play for instance<br/>1/1  9/8  5/4  4/3 melodically. Yet 1/1  9/8  81/64  4/3 sounds of<br/>perfect pitch height to me.</p><p>Furthermore, there is ample evidence that western music functions according<br/>to fifths and octaves, and that the major third has included in its<br/>functionality that of being 4 fifths from its root.</p><p>If one breaks this functionality one gets horrible sounding comma shifts and<br/>or wolves and or drifting. And not only do these sound horrible, they also<br/>make no sense in proper musical logic I think (I wont go deeper into this<br/>or this email may take on the length of a book).</p><p>And if we look at higher harmonics and their timbral qualities, we find that<br/>the 7th harmonic for instance makes a very nice dominant seventh chord of<br/>1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4, which sounds great / locked etc in isolation, but also<br/>even more clearly out of tune in the musical context of normal music,<br/>and it has all the same problems as 5-limit JI, comma shifts, wolfs and<br/>drifting, only even more so.</p><p>So again without going further into this, Ill from now on talk about the<br/>5/4 in the context of &frac14; comma meantone and fifth based thinking.</p><p>Just like with the 5/4 major third, and the 7/4 minor seventh, we like the<br/>timbral lock of 2/1 and 3/2.</p><p>The octave at 2/1 is well supported to coincide to how we perceive music<br/>(for instance octave equivalence), and theres not much sense in making the<br/>octave anything other than 2/1 other than small timbre specific<br/>modifications (like slightly stretched tunings for pianos for instance).</p><p>The 3/2 we like too to be pure, it sounds best. But does our ear / brain<br/>expect it to be pure? Or 12tet, or meantone?<br/>If found that it does indeed work best when used pure as 3/2. Diatonic music<br/>sounds most clear and in tune to me with 3/2 fifths. And furthermore I find<br/>that more remote augmented and diminished intervals still sound perfect to<br/>me when they are tuned according to many pure fifths.</p><p>Here an example:</p><p>Play C-C-E-G -&gt; F-C-F-Ab -&gt; E-B-E-G#, A-C-E-A in Pythagorean and in &frac14;<br/>comma meantone.</p><p>In Pythagorean this progression sounds perfectly natural and good to me, the<br/>comma shift of Ab going up to G# sounds clear and right.</p><p>In &frac14; comma meantone however, the comma shift goes downwards instead, and it<br/>sounds bad and unnatural to me. The errors of the flat fifths of meantone<br/>add up for more remote intervals and this error become more and more<br/>audible.</p><p>For diatonic music, a comparison between different fifth sizes Ive uploaded<br/>the demonstration I referred to earlier to soundcloud:</p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mussorgsky">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mussorgsky</a></p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mozart-alla-turca">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mozart-alla-turca</a></p><p>After uploading these, I realized you may not be able to play these either<br/>as soundcloud uses flash as well ;) so Ive uploaded them here as well:<br/><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!TRdmTJbD!RZQz1VOpAohZBQP7TKYxtCQu6hg0drRUH4J8DjF6yME">https://mega.co.nz/#!TRdmTJbD!RZQz1VOpAohZBQP7TKYxtCQu6hg0drRUH4J8DjF6yME</a><br/><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!zFMhzaBS!NSQX3TeErk92uGCxzukSNQP3ORRLWyk4eya7FcOBIWc">https://mega.co.nz/#!zFMhzaBS!NSQX3TeErk92uGCxzukSNQP3ORRLWyk4eya7FcOBIWc</a></p><p>Hope this works for you.</p><p>The order of tuning is 12tet, Pythagorean, &frac14; comma meantone, 17tet for both<br/>files.</p><p>To my ears, both the 12tet version and Pythagorean version sound correct,<br/>and upon closer listen the Pythagorean version wins over the 12tet version<br/>as it is slightly more clear and expressive and right sounding to me.</p><p>The &frac14; comma meantone and 17tet versions both sound out of tune to me.</p><p>Many people on this list may prefer the &frac14; comma meantone version though. And<br/>thats fine with me. The music comes across in that version as well. They<br/>may be listening to the timbral effect of those 5/4 major thirds, just like<br/>I used to do, and use this to determine what is in tune to them, or what<br/>they prefer.</p><p>However, the majority of the general public has not learned to listen for<br/>the timbral effects of 5/4, and even though the timbral effect of 5/4 is in<br/>ways objectively pleasant, Ive found that normal people (without<br/>exception so far) heard the &frac14; meantone version and 17tet version as out of<br/>tune. &frac14; meantone is not general public friendly anymore. It may have been<br/>when they didnt know much else, or when there is no direct comparison<br/>available, but now that they know 12tet it is not an improvement over it for<br/>them (and not to me either).</p><p>Now to get back to the original point. You say that some music implies<br/>meantone to give it rest in certain chords.</p><p>I say this is in the ears of the beholder. For me it is clearly not so. All<br/>music from the meantone period sounds best to me in Pythagorean, not<br/>meantone. And the Pythagorean or 12tet  major chords just as well express<br/>rest etc.</p><p>It may sound best to you in meantone, and thats fine with me. But it is not<br/>linked to the music in an objective way I think.</p><p>I see music in its basis as separate from the composer and period.</p><p>Music is like a book and notes are like words. One can put on a different<br/>cover, include a picture and small bio from the author, use a different<br/>font, etc. But as long as the font does not make the words unreadable, all<br/>these things may add something for some readers extra context that may make<br/>it more enjoyable to some, or more authentic, etc, but the words say the<br/>same thing.</p><p>To try to base meantone or 5-limit or higher limit JI perception and link<br/>this to music on objective qualities is not something that is defendable I<br/>think, and I hope that you can agree with my arguments for this. (and I have<br/>many more in reserve ;) ).</p><p>Btw Ive listened to your audio examples.</p><p>And I say this with all respect, but they do not sound good to me, sorry.</p><p>Especially the comma shifting ones sound very bad to me. Also could not see<br/>anything like that become general public friendly.</p><p>The Gesualdo song sounded most acceptable to me (in a meantone tuning?).</p><p>But if these things do work for your ears, then of course Im not objecting<br/>to that :)</p><p>As for the historical context. As Ive explained above I think it is not<br/>relevant / tied to the music in an objective sense.</p><p>It is of course relevant in order to play it historically correct.</p><p>I do question however the link between popular tunings of the time and type<br/>of compositions made.</p><p>Ill try to write back to you on this later.</p><p>But even if meantone was influential in using major and minor chords as for<br/>instance final chords (again I do not think this is the case), then still<br/>this does not mean that the music itself implies meantone.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2013 8:00:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Dear Margo,</p><p>&gt; First of all, thank you for your in depth reply!</p><p>You&apos;re welcome, and your reply and pieces give me a chance to<br/>clarify some of my views.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll reply without quoting as my reply will become large enough<br/>&gt; already without them I&apos;m guessing ;)</p><p>What I&apos;ll do is to quote here selectively, focusing especially on<br/>questions you raise where clearer answers may help, whether to<br/>reveal areas of agreement or to make disagreements more<br/>understandable to each of us and to other readers.</p><p>Also, I should say something about scholarly and artistic<br/>humility, since here I am somewhat in the role of defending the<br/>conventional wisdom, which might or might not be right.</p><p>A famous or infamous example of less than infallible judgment<br/>occurred a bit more than 400 years, when Artusi wrote of the many<br/>&quot;imperfections&quot; in the music of Monteverdi. Both Artusi&apos;s<br/>knowledge of conventional counterpoint, and his ears, told him<br/>that Monteverdi was using dissonances and also certain melodic<br/>intervals (e.g. diminished fourths) in a way which violated not<br/>only the familiar rules but good taste. The verdict of history<br/>has generally been quite different as to the value of his music.</p><p>I am equally capable of fallible, not to say highly quirky,<br/>judgment. All that I write should be read with that important<br/>caution.</p><p>&gt; Our main point of disagreement seems to be that you think 5/4<br/>&gt; or near 5/4 major thirds are implied in certain music.</p><p>Yes, in certain styles of music, especially assuming harmonic<br/>timbres.</p><p>&gt; And if I understand you correctly, this is in a way<br/>&gt; irrespective of the period of composition.</p><p>Actually I&apos;d say it&apos;s specific to certain periods or styles, with<br/>16th-century European music as the focus for my statement about<br/>5/4 or something close to it being appropriate in harmonic<br/>timbres for this specific style. A fine point as to &quot;period of<br/>composition&quot; is that whether a piece is composed in 1555 or 2005,<br/>if it follows this style (fairly well defined by the usual rules<br/>of 16th-century counterpoint and harmony), then my argument would<br/>apply.</p><p>Yet more specifically, I have in mind a style by around 1520-1530<br/>where major thirds are increasingly preferred in closing<br/>sonorities, and more generally at points of repose (if a third is<br/>used at all); and three or more voices move at moderate speed in<br/>note-against-note writing. In fast, two-part counterpoint,<br/>intonation might not be so sensitive; and around 1500,<br/>Pythagorean as well as 5-limit or meantone ideals may have shaped<br/>vocal performances, for example.</p><p>To give a minority view: Roger Wibberley has suggested that<br/>Pythagorean may have remained common in vocal practice through<br/>the epoch of Willaert (c. 1540), and raises the issue of comma<br/>drift in 5-limit. So there are various sides to this question.</p><p>&gt;  So we&apos;re not just talking about historical correctness here<br/>&gt;  but also about (near) 5/4 major thirds having a &quot;restfulness&quot;<br/>&gt;  and that this is implied by the music itself.</p><p>For the kind of 16th-century style I&apos;m discussing, I would say it<br/>is in a sense implied by the music itself -- at least in a strong<br/>harmonic timbre. On the lute, 12-tET was standard, but a heavier<br/>meantone temperament on keyboards -- then, for example, the organ<br/>and harpsichord, rather than the later piano with its somewhat<br/>more subdued fifth partials (analogous to those of the lute).</p><p>With some other kinds of music, &quot;historical correctness&quot; may be<br/>more easily separated from the nature of the music itself. Your<br/>caution to keep this distinction in mind is itself very wise! For<br/>example, Bach&apos;s music seems to fit many irregular systems as well<br/>as 12-tet, thus the many debates about the &quot;correct&quot; tuning(s).</p><p>&gt; This I see very differently, and I will try to explain why.</p><p>Your arguments help in identifying the issues.</p><p>&gt; This is often described by chords, but melody is nothing<br/>&gt; different. We judge the pitches of a melody against one<br/>&gt; another.</p><p>&gt; The difference is that in a monophonic melody the pitches do<br/>&gt; not sound at the same time. But this does not matter in my<br/>&gt; opinion.</p><p>In my view, and that of George Secor, the melodic and harmonic or<br/>vertical dimensions of music may sometimes lead intonation in the<br/>same direction, and sometimes be in tension. See</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/Secor17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  I happen to have somewhat of an example of the latter online<br/>&gt;  in Pythagorean<br/>&gt;  [42]<a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-elgar-enigma-theme">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-elgar-enigma-theme</a></p><p>&gt;  (part of Chris Vaisvil&apos;s Enigma assignment:<br/>&gt;  &lt;<a href="http://soonlabel.com/xenharmonic/archives/884">http://soonlabel.com/xenharmonic/archives/884</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  Here you can hear one monophonic melodic line first and then<br/>&gt;  on each repetition another melody comes in and together they<br/>&gt;  form the chords.</p><p>This piece I like! In fact, there have been studies suggesting<br/>the performers of classic European music at least sometimes tend<br/>to approximate Pythagorean rather than 5-limit JI or 12-tET.</p><p>Again, as I also emphasized to Jake, my statements were focusing<br/>specifically on a 16th-century style.</p><p>&gt;  But, is this timbral lock the definition of &quot;in tune&quot;? I used<br/>&gt;  to think so after the first time I played a 5/4 major third on<br/>&gt;  my keyboard. And many other people will have thought the same<br/>&gt;  after they first heard a 5/4 major third.</p><p>Since I often tune major thirds at around 414-418 cents, and have<br/>done so for many years, clearly I would not regard 5/4 as the<br/>definition of &quot;in tune.&quot; But it can be the definition of<br/>&quot;stylistically in tune&quot; for most 16th-century music. Different<br/>writers may draw different lines. Thus Vincenzo Galilei reports<br/>that 81/64 is &quot;dissonant,&quot; and 12-tET ideal both in theory and<br/>practice on the lute, but 2/7-comma better on the harpsichord<br/>(although this in part, he suggests, might be matter of habit),</p><p>&gt; Play C&apos;-C-E-G -&gt; F&apos;&apos;-C-F-Ab -&gt; E&apos;-B&apos;-E-G#, A&apos;&apos;-C-E-A in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean and in 1/4 comma meantone.</p><p>&gt; In Pythagorean this progression sounds perfectly natural and<br/>&gt; good to me, the comma shift of Ab going up to G# sounds clear<br/>&gt; and &quot;right&quot;.</p><p>&gt; In 1/4 comma meantone however, the comma shift goes downwards<br/>&gt; instead, and it sounds bad and unnatural to me. The errors of<br/>&gt; the flat fifths of meantone add up for more remote intervals<br/>&gt; and this error become more and more audible.</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone, I find this diesis shift of 128/125 or 41 cents, about 1/5 tone, as striking and in keeping with the<br/>system. For me, in a Renaissance setting, Ab is already a bit of<br/>a &quot;remote accidental&quot; rather than part of the usual Eb-G# system,<br/>so I&apos;m ready for interesting things to happen. Your example is a<br/>great illustration of how the diesis moves downward in meantone!</p><p>The Pythagorean is interesting also, and acceptable for me, if<br/>the stylistic context fits these third sizes.</p><p>With meantone, however, if one wanted to avoid the downward<br/>diesis shift, there is, for me, a neat alternative solution:</p><p>      G   G#*/Ab  G#*   A<br/>      E     F     E*    E<br/>      C     C     B*    C<br/>      C     F     E*    A</p><p>Here I&apos;m using a *, like Vicentino&apos;s dot, to show a note raised<br/>by an enharmonic diesis or fifthtone. So the first two sonorities<br/>are as in your example -- and then we treat the highest note of<br/>the second sonority, G#* or Ab, as a common tone for the<br/>following E*-B*-E*-G#*, which resolves back to A. The cadence<br/>with the last two sonorities is the kind of thing Vicentino often<br/>writes in this enharmonic style with the fifthtone steps. I&apos;m<br/>aware that you don&apos;t care for diesis shifts, as noted below, but<br/>while I didn&apos;t have trouble with your original progression, this<br/>is what I might well use, since the cadence is so idiomatic!</p><p>&gt;  For diatonic music, a comparison between different fifth sizes<br/>&gt;  I&apos;ve uploaded the demonstration I referred to earlier to<br/>&gt;  soundcloud:</p><p>&gt;  [44]<a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mussorgsky">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mussorgsky</a><br/>&gt;  [45]<a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mozart-alla-turca">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mozart-alla-turca</a></p><p>These links were easy for me to download from: thank you!</p><p>With the Mussorgsky, a piece from the Romantic era I really like,<br/>all four versions sounded acceptable to me, including the 17-tET!</p><p>With the Mozart, the 17-tET sounded a bit curious, but everything<br/>else fine.</p><p>&gt; I say this is in the ears of the beholder.</p><p>That is clearly true!</p><p>&gt; All music from the meantone period sounds best to me in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, not meantone. And the Pythagorean or 12tet major<br/>&gt; chords just as well express &quot;rest&quot; etc.</p><p>Of course, my perceptions reflect my own musical experience,<br/>which could be anything but typical of the &quot;general public.&quot;<br/>We are dealing with interactions of tuning/timbre/style.<br/>Also, since I spend so much of time with music where thirds are<br/>unstable, I may tend to want to put music where they&apos;re stable in<br/>a special category, by using meantone (or 5-limit JI). In either<br/>the 16th or the 21st century, most of the &quot;general public&quot; might<br/>not have this focus on 13th-14th century European music!</p><p>Please let me add that I focused on Pythagorean or larger thirds<br/>in harmonic timbres. Obviously people find major triads quite<br/>stable in 12-tET, and on a piano, I&apos;ve routinely played<br/>16th-century music without any problem (as they did back then on<br/>lute). Easley Blackwood has suggested he perceives a limit for<br/>convincing classic major/minor or the like at around 405 cents,<br/>although he wasn&apos;t, as I recall, addressing a specific style or<br/>timbre, each of which, in my view, could make a big difference.<br/>My own view is that 12-tET can represent either Pythagorean or<br/>meantone, but in a timbre with a bright fifth partial might tend<br/>more to the former.</p><p>&gt; Btw I&apos;ve listened to your audio examples.</p><p>&gt; And I say this with all respect, but they do not sound good to<br/>&gt; me, sorry.</p><p>Fair enough, and thank you for your honest opinion, which is all<br/>that I could ask.</p><p>&gt; Especially the comma shifting ones sound very bad to me. Also<br/>&gt; could not see anything like that become general public<br/>&gt; friendly.</p><p>Well, Vincenzo Galilei said rather similar things about Vicentino<br/>in 1581, focusing a lot on the general public&apos;s lack of demand<br/>for such music. Then, and now, such music is xenharmonic, and<br/>stands apart from any relevant &quot;common practice&quot;; and for my<br/>Invocation, Vicentino was certainly one model! The Coimbra<br/>Manuscript piece, maybe from around 1600, also uses his<br/>enharmonic steps.</p><p>A small technical point, as also in your example of a progression<br/>in 1/4-comma meantone with descending Ab-G#, is that I would call<br/>this an enharmonic diesis shift, 128/125, the difference between<br/>12 meantone fifths and 7 octaves at 2/1, and also between three<br/>pure 5/4 thirds and a 2/1 (the &quot;lesser diesis&quot; of 5-limit JI).<br/>However, since this 12-note meantone diesis is equivalent to the<br/>Pythagorean comma, your &quot;comma shift&quot; could also be correct.</p><p>&gt; The Gesualdo song sounded most acceptable to me (in a meantone<br/>&gt; tuning?).</p><p>It&apos;s a variation on 1/4-comma described by Vicentino, where we<br/>have two chains of fifths at 1/4-comma apart, making possible<br/>pure 5-limit intervals with only very small shifts of 5.38 cents<br/>rather than the comma shifts of classical 5-limit JI. There<br/>weren&apos;t any diesis shifts.</p><p>&gt; But if these things do work for your ears, then of course I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not objecting to that.</p><p>I understand. And finding the Mussorgsky pleasant in 17-EDO was<br/>really interesting. As I note above, all your examples in<br/>Pythagorean sounded fine to me. From my point of view, apart from<br/>the fact that these are not in 16th-century style, and more<br/>specifically in a slower note-against-style, possible factors<br/>could include timbre, tempo, rules of counterpoint, etc.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;marcel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2013 11:21:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>I forgot to write about the different models for consonance, so I&apos;ll add<br/>it here.</p><p>On these tuning lists the models for consonance are often harmonics based.<br/>For instance something like consonance in this order: 1/1, 2/1, 3/1,<br/>3/2, 4/1, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/5, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 7/5, 7/6,<br/>8/1, 8/3, 8/5, 8/7, etc becoming progressively more dissonant.<br/>And the harmonic entropy model popular here is based on identification<br/>of harmonics as well.<br/>These models do not agree with Pythagorean very well (or at all is<br/>perhaps more like it).<br/>But there is an in my opinion much simpler model for consonance which<br/>does fit Pythagorean like a glove and also fits actual music and<br/>existing music theory much better than the harmonics based models.<br/>It is the well known and explored model of &quot;auditory&quot; roughness (first<br/>described by Helmholtz I belief) combined with simplicity of ratio in<br/>Pythagorean (number of fifths spanning the interval).<br/>I have searched a bit and have not found this model described anywhere,<br/>so there&apos;s a small chance I may have invented it myself, though this is<br/>probably not very likely as I can&apos;t imagine someone else hasn&apos;t done<br/>this before me based on 12tet fifths instead of Pythagorean fifths<br/>(which gives about the same results except for remote intervals).<br/>The model goes like this. We simply take the Pythagorean intervals, and<br/>say that by definition the simpler interval is in a way the most consonant.<br/>So intervals go like this from simple to more complex: 2/1, 3/2, 4/3,<br/>9/8, 16/9, 27/16, 32/27, 81/64, 128/81, 243/128, 256/243, 729/512,<br/>1024/729, etc..<br/>Now we put on top of this the roughness model. Intervals that are closer<br/>together have more roughness (unless they&apos;re so close together that the<br/>2 tones are perceived as one tone, but we&apos;re not dealing with that here).<br/>And we also put on top of this octave equivalence and harmonic timbres.<br/>And root of chord as I&apos;ll explain below.<br/>The harmonics 2/1 and 3/1 are most often the strongest of course.<br/>So we see that 2/1 and 3/2 which are the simplest Pythagorean ratios,<br/>are the most consonant tones.<br/>Now for the next simplest ratio, 4/3, we see something different. While<br/>it is consonant when played with the octave, it gives roughness due to<br/>the proximity of the 2/1 overtone of the F 4/3 note, and the 3/1<br/>overtone of the C 1/1 note.<br/>I am in favor of using the model of root of chord being determined by a<br/>perfect fifth above it. (due to harmonic timbres having 2/1 and 3/1<br/>harmonics so strongly, and even in inharmonic timbres these overtones<br/>may be generated in the ear to some degree)<br/>So 4/3 is very consonant if it is seen as an inversion of a root 3/2<br/>chord, but it produces roughness with the 3/2 if it is seen as a 4/3<br/>above the root of the chord.<br/>I&apos;d go as far as saying that by in my definition a root position chord<br/>implies a 3/2 and 2/1 above the root.<br/>So when we explore the other simple ratios, 9/8 and 16/9, they produce<br/>roughness again with either the 1/1 or 2/1.<br/>27/16 produces roughness with 3/2 (but if we combine it with 4/3 instead<br/>of 3/2, and see it as an inversion then there is minimal roughness).<br/>32/27 produces the least amount of roughness with 1/1, 3/2 and 2/1.<br/>81/64 also produces the least amount of roughness with 1/1, 3/2 and 2/1.<br/>Both 32/27 and 81/64 are the most consonant tones possible when combined<br/>with 3/2 and 2/1. In other words, the major and minor triads.<br/>Then we get intervals which are more complex in Pythagorean but also all<br/>produce more roughness. 128/81 is rough with 3/2, 243/128 is rough with<br/>2/1, 256/243 is rough with 1/1, 729/512 is again rough with 3/2, and the<br/>intervals are getting more dissonant as well simply by their increasing<br/>complexity / number of fifths.<br/>So in the model of 4 tone chords inside the octave (including the<br/>octave) from root position the most consonant chords are 1/1 81/64 3/2<br/>2/1, and 1/1 32/27 3/2 2/1.<br/>If we extend this to 5 tones including octave and within the octave and<br/>in root position we get something like this: 1/1 32/27 3/2 16/9 2/1 is<br/>simplest, perhaps together with 1/1 81/64 3/2 27/16 2/1 as most<br/>consonant, followed by 1/1 81/64 3/2 16/9 2/1 and 1/1 32/27 3/2 27/16<br/>2/1, and then perhaps 1/1 81/64 3/2 243/128 2/1 and 1/1 32/27 3/2 128/81 2/1? Though not sure on the order of consonance of these chords as it<br/>become a balance between interval complexity and roughness weighing of<br/>multiple tones together etc.<br/>But in any case, this model seems to explain a lot of things we see in<br/>actual music, and fits normal music theory very well.<br/>It is also flexible enough I think to not impose these consonance<br/>ratings as absolute rules, but allows for personal / cultural preferences.<br/>(One small note: in normal music theory a perfect fifth above root is<br/>not always implied, but disagree with this definition and it is<br/>inconsistent.<br/>Take for instance the B-D-F chord, it is often described as having a<br/>root of B due to the peculiarities of the diatonic naming system the F<br/>is a diminished fifth. I think the actual root will most often be G for<br/>this chord. And if we were to add a note to this chord making B-D-F-Ab<br/>then all of a sudden normal music theory agrees with me and also says<br/>that the true root of this chord is G (most simple interpretation), so I<br/>think it&apos;s better and more consistent theory to say the true root always<br/>implies a perfect fifth above it.)</p><p>Furthermore, often Pythagorean is discredited by the many stacked fifths<br/>which does not make sense to some people who favor a more &quot;simple&quot; model<br/>based on harmonics.<br/>This is still relevant to the meantone discussion I think as somewhere<br/>underneath meantone thinking I still see some form of harmonic thinking.<br/>For instance the harmonic entropy model is based on the perception and<br/>identification of harmonics.<br/>What most people don&apos;t realize is that the model of interval perception<br/>based on harmonics is actually much more complex and much larger than<br/>the Pythagorean model of interval identification!<br/>If we take for instance the first 16 harmonics and reduce them to the<br/>octave so we get a small scale of a mere 8 tones per octave like this:<br/>1/1 9/8 5/4 11/8 3/2 13/8 7/4 15/8 2/1<br/>This small scale already has 48 unique intervals contained within the<br/>octave. And it&apos;s not even very musical in its possibilities yet (one<br/>can&apos;t even play proper pentatonic scales in it, let alone the major or<br/>minor scales).<br/>Now in contrast, here an 8 tone Pythagorean scale:<br/>1/1 9/8 32/27 81/64 4/3 3/2 27/16 16/9 2/1<br/>It has a mere 14 unique intervals per octave (34 less than the harmonic<br/>scale!), and it is already much broader in musical application that the<br/>harmonic scale above (it has the major and minor scales + an extra tone)<br/>And here a 12 tone Pythagorean scale, 4 tones larger than the harmonic<br/>scale above, and one can already play most western music in it if one<br/>transposes the key to the key of the piece.<br/>1/1 256/243 9/8 32/27 81/64 4/3 729/512 3/2 128/81 27/16 16/9 243/128 2/1<br/>It has a mere 22 unique intervals per octave. Still much less than the 8<br/>tone harmonic scale. And every one of these 22 unique intervals which we<br/>know to have a specific place and function in music, from the octave all<br/>the way to the diminished sixth.<br/>So while the Pythagorean model may seem more complex due to the larger<br/>ratios, it is the exact opposite. The Pythagorean model is actually the<br/>most simple and the smallest model possible for unique identifiable<br/>intervals.</p><p>Also, I already mentioned in my previous email how 1/4 comma meantone<br/>starts sounding particularly bad to me when going further than the<br/>diatonic system (gave the Ab to G# example).<br/>What also happens is that 1/4 comma meantone doesn&apos;t really go anywhere<br/>useful I think when it is extended.<br/>Pythagorean on the other hand is. It gives things like the 22-tone<br/>Indian shruti and Arabic/Turkish maqam intervals.</p><p>So I see in total also a much stronger theoretical argument for<br/>Pythagorean for any music than I see for meantones or other systems that<br/>try to exploit harmonics overtones other than 3/2.<br/>And I see only historically correctness and personal preferences as<br/>valid arguments for meantone tuning for music from the meantone period.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Marcel de Velde</p><p>&gt; Dear Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all, thank you for your in depth reply!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll reply without quoting as my reply will become large enough<br/>&gt; already without them I&apos;m guessing ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Our main point of disagreement seems to be that you think 5/4 or near<br/>&gt; 5/4 major thirds are implied in certain music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if I understand you correctly, this is in a way irrespective of<br/>&gt; the period of composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we&apos;re not just talking about historical correctness here but also<br/>&gt; about (near) 5/4 major thirds having a &quot;restfulness&quot; and that this is<br/>&gt; implied by the music itself.<br/>&gt; This I see very differently, and I will try to explain why.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all. I think tuning is first and foremost about relative<br/>&gt; pitch height (intervals) of notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is often described by chords, but melody is nothing different. We<br/>&gt; judge the pitches of a melody against one another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference is that in a monophonic melody the pitches do not sound<br/>&gt; at the same time. But this does not matter in my opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll illustrate:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Play the chords C-E-G, A-C-E, D-F-A, G-B-D, C-E-G-C<br/>&gt; And now play the melody C, E, G, A, C, E, D, F, A, G, B, D, C, E, G, C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you can hear, they express the exact same thing. To say the chord<br/>&gt; version implies something different, in tuning or otherwise, is absurd<br/>&gt; in my opinion. (not that I think you said so, just to be clear)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or as another example, out of a polyphonic composition, you can pick<br/>&gt; out and play by itself any of the melodic lines. Doing so of course<br/>&gt; does not change the melody or it&apos;s tuning, and vice versa.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I happen to have somewhat of an example of the latter online in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean<br/>&gt; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-elgar-enigma-theme">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-elgar-enigma-theme</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (part of Chris Vaisvil&apos;s Enigma assignment:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://soonlabel.com/xenharmonic/archives/884">http://soonlabel.com/xenharmonic/archives/884</a> )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here you can hear one monophonic melodic line first and then on each<br/>&gt; repetition another melody comes in and together they form the chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now of course it would make absolutely no musical sense at all to<br/>&gt; change the tuning of the melody when other melodies are introduced in<br/>&gt; counterpoint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I do agree with is that when one plays a chord in isolation, say<br/>&gt; C-E-G. That when one compares C-E as 5/4 and C-E as 81/64, that the<br/>&gt; 5/4 version sounds more &quot;locked&quot;, and has a timbral quality that one<br/>&gt; could describe as more &quot;restful&quot;. And this indeed most clear with<br/>&gt; harmonic timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, is this timbral lock the definition of &quot;in tune&quot;? I used to think<br/>&gt; so after the first time I played a 5/4 major third on my keyboard. And<br/>&gt; many other people will have thought the same after they first heard a<br/>&gt; 5/4 major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since that experience I started listening for this timbral lock in<br/>&gt; music and used it as my identifier of whether that music was &quot;in tune&quot;<br/>&gt; or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But after many years of research, experimenting and comparing tunings<br/>&gt; etc, I have come to very different ideas about what makes music &quot;in tune&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll refer back to the melodies vs chords example I wrote about above.<br/>&gt; I find that the 5/4 major third sounds too low to me when I play for<br/>&gt; instance 1/1 -- 9/8 -- 5/4 -- 4/3 melodically. Yet 1/1 -- 9/8 -- 81/64<br/>&gt; -- 4/3 sounds of perfect pitch height to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Furthermore, there is ample evidence that western music functions<br/>&gt; according to fifths and octaves, and that the major third has included<br/>&gt; in its functionality that of being 4 fifths from its root.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one breaks this functionality one gets horrible sounding comma<br/>&gt; shifts and or wolves and or drifting. And not only do these sound<br/>&gt; horrible, they also make no sense in proper musical logic I think (I<br/>&gt; won&apos;t go deeper into this or this email may take on the length of a book).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And if we look at higher harmonics and their timbral qualities, we<br/>&gt; find that the 7^th harmonic for instance makes a very nice dominant<br/>&gt; seventh chord of 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4, which sounds &quot;great&quot; / &quot;locked&quot; etc<br/>&gt; in isolation, but also even more clearly &quot;out of tune&quot; in the musical<br/>&gt; context of &quot;normal&quot; music, and it has all the same problems as 5-limit<br/>&gt; JI, comma shifts, wolfs and drifting, only even more so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So again without going further into this, I&apos;ll from now on talk about<br/>&gt; the 5/4 in the context of &frac14; comma meantone and fifth based thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just like with the 5/4 major third, and the 7/4 minor seventh, we like<br/>&gt; the &quot;timbral lock&quot; of 2/1 and 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The octave at 2/1 is well supported to coincide to how we perceive<br/>&gt; music (for instance octave equivalence), and there&apos;s not much sense in<br/>&gt; making the octave anything other than 2/1 other than small timbre<br/>&gt; specific modifications (like slightly stretched tunings for pianos for<br/>&gt; instance).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 3/2 we like too to be pure, it sounds best. But does our ear /<br/>&gt; brain expect it to be pure? Or 12tet, or meantone?<br/>&gt; If found that it does indeed work best when used pure as 3/2. Diatonic<br/>&gt; music sounds most clear and in tune to me with 3/2 fifths. And<br/>&gt; furthermore I find that more remote augmented and diminished intervals<br/>&gt; still sound perfect to me when they are tuned according to many pure<br/>&gt; fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here an example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Play C&apos;-C-E-G -&gt; F&apos;&apos;-C-F-Ab -&gt; E&apos;-B&apos;-E-G#, A&apos;&apos;-C-E-A in Pythagorean<br/>&gt; and in &frac14; comma meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Pythagorean this progression sounds perfectly natural and good to<br/>&gt; me, the comma shift of Ab going up to G# sounds clear and &quot;right&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In &frac14; comma meantone however, the comma shift goes downwards instead,<br/>&gt; and it sounds bad and unnatural to me. The errors of the flat fifths<br/>&gt; of meantone add up for more remote intervals and this error become<br/>&gt; more and more audible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For diatonic music, a comparison between different fifth sizes I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; uploaded the demonstration I referred to earlier to soundcloud:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mussorgsky">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mussorgsky</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mozart-alla-turca">https://soundcloud.com/justintonation/tuning-demo-mozart-alla-turca</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After uploading these, I realized you may not be able to play these<br/>&gt; either as soundcloud uses flash as well ;) so I&apos;ve uploaded them here<br/>&gt; as well:<br/>&gt; <a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!TRdmTJbD!RZQz1VOpAohZBQP7TKYxtCQu6hg0drRUH4J8DjF6yME">https://mega.co.nz/#!TRdmTJbD!RZQz1VOpAohZBQP7TKYxtCQu6hg0drRUH4J8DjF6yME</a><br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://mega.co.nz/#%21TRdmTJbD%21RZQz1VOpAohZBQP7TKYxtCQu6hg0drRUH4J8DjF6yME">https://mega.co.nz/#%21TRdmTJbD%21RZQz1VOpAohZBQP7TKYxtCQu6hg0drRUH4J8DjF6yME</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!zFMhzaBS!NSQX3TeErk92uGCxzukSNQP3ORRLWyk4eya7FcOBIWc">https://mega.co.nz/#!zFMhzaBS!NSQX3TeErk92uGCxzukSNQP3ORRLWyk4eya7FcOBIWc</a><br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://mega.co.nz/#%21zFMhzaBS%21NSQX3TeErk92uGCxzukSNQP3ORRLWyk4eya7FcOBIWc">https://mega.co.nz/#%21zFMhzaBS%21NSQX3TeErk92uGCxzukSNQP3ORRLWyk4eya7FcOBIWc</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this works for you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The order of tuning is 12tet, Pythagorean, &frac14; comma meantone, 17tet for<br/>&gt; both files.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To my ears, both the 12tet version and Pythagorean version sound<br/>&gt; correct, and upon closer listen the Pythagorean version wins over the<br/>&gt; 12tet version as it is slightly more clear and expressive and &quot;right&quot;<br/>&gt; sounding to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &frac14; comma meantone and 17tet versions both sound &quot;out of tune&quot; to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Many people on this list may prefer the &frac14; comma meantone version<br/>&gt; though. And that&apos;s fine with me. The music comes across in that<br/>&gt; version as well. They may be listening to the timbral effect of those<br/>&gt; 5/4 major thirds, just like I used to do, and use this to determine<br/>&gt; what is &quot;in tune&quot; to them, or what they prefer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the majority of the general public has not learned to listen<br/>&gt; for the timbral effects of 5/4, and even though the timbral effect of<br/>&gt; 5/4 is in ways objectively pleasant, I&apos;ve found that &quot;normal&quot; people<br/>&gt; (without exception so far) heard the &frac14; meantone version and 17tet<br/>&gt; version as &quot;out of tune&quot;. &frac14; meantone is not general public friendly<br/>&gt; anymore. It may have been when they didn&apos;t know much else, or when<br/>&gt; there is no direct comparison available, but now that they know 12tet<br/>&gt; it is not an improvement over it for them (and not to me either).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now to get back to the original point. You say that some music implies<br/>&gt; meantone to give it &quot;rest&quot; in certain chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I say this is in the ears of the beholder. For me it is clearly not<br/>&gt; so. All music from the meantone period sounds best to me in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, not meantone. And the Pythagorean or 12tet  major chords<br/>&gt; just as well express &quot;rest&quot; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It may sound best to you in meantone, and that&apos;s fine with me. But it<br/>&gt; is not linked to the music in an objective way I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see music in its basis as separate from the composer and period.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Music is like a book and notes are like words. One can put on a<br/>&gt; different cover, include a picture and small bio from the author, use<br/>&gt; a different font, etc. But as long as the font does not make the words<br/>&gt; unreadable, all these things may add something for some readers extra<br/>&gt; context that may make it more enjoyable to some, or more authentic,<br/>&gt; etc, but the words say the same thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To try to base meantone or 5-limit or higher limit JI perception and<br/>&gt; link this to music on objective qualities is not something that is<br/>&gt; defendable I think, and I hope that you can agree with my arguments<br/>&gt; for this. (and I have many more in reserve ;) ).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Btw I&apos;ve listened to your audio examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I say this with all respect, but they do not sound good to me, sorry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Especially the comma shifting ones sound very bad to me. Also could<br/>&gt; not see anything like that become general public friendly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Gesualdo song sounded most acceptable to me (in a meantone tuning?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if these things do work for your ears, then of course I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; objecting to that J<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the historical context. As I&apos;ve explained above I think it is<br/>&gt; not relevant / tied to the music in an objective sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is of course relevant in order to play it historically &quot;correct&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do question however the link between popular tunings of the time and<br/>&gt; type of compositions made.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll try to write back to you on this later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But even if meantone was influential in using major and minor chords<br/>&gt; as for instance final chords (again I do not think this is the case),<br/>&gt; then still this does not mean that the music itself implies meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kind regards,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;marcel@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2013 11:43:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>I just sent my other email and only now read yours!</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re welcome, and your reply and pieces give me a chance to<br/>&gt; clarify some of my views.<br/>&gt;<br/>Glad to hear that :) And this works for me too.<br/>I may not be replying in depth to your historical arguments. But they are very much appreciated and I&apos;m learning a great deal from it.<br/>The reason I&apos;m not replying in depth to them is simply because your knowledge on this goes much further than mine! And I don&apos;t have much to add or contest.</p><p>&gt; A famous or infamous example of less than infallible judgment<br/>&gt; occurred a bit more than 400 years, when Artusi wrote of the many<br/>&gt; &quot;imperfections&quot; in the music of Monteverdi. Both Artusi&apos;s<br/>&gt; knowledge of conventional counterpoint, and his ears, told him<br/>&gt; that Monteverdi was using dissonances and also certain melodic<br/>&gt; intervals (e.g. diminished fourths) in a way which violated not<br/>&gt; only the familiar rules but good taste. The verdict of history<br/>&gt; has generally been quite different as to the value of his music.<br/>&gt;<br/>Ah it sounds like I may agree with Artusi there. I have not seen the music of Menteverdi that he&apos;s referring to, but if it is the case that Monteverdi may have used diminished fourths in placeswhere a major third makes sense, then I may well also see it as a case where a major third is interpreted by our brain even though a diminished fourth is written. In which case writing a diminished fourth would make no musical sense. I&apos;ve argued for correct enharmonic spelling in such cases before.<br/>Though again I have not seen this music by Monteverdi, so perhaps he used the diminished fourths in a way I do agree with.</p><p>&gt; I am equally capable of fallible, not to say highly quirky,<br/>&gt; judgment. All that I write should be read with that important<br/>&gt; caution.<br/>&gt;<br/>I can appreciate you saying this! But it goes for everybody I think. Myself very much included ;)<br/>I have spent years spewing the greatest nonsense on these tuning lists while trying to make 5-limit JI work haha.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Our main point of disagreement seems to be that you think 5/4<br/>&gt; &gt; or near 5/4 major thirds are implied in certain music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, in certain styles of music, especially assuming harmonic<br/>&gt; timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And if I understand you correctly, this is in a way<br/>&gt; &gt; irrespective of the period of composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually I&apos;d say it&apos;s specific to certain periods or styles, with<br/>&gt; 16th-century European music as the focus for my statement about<br/>&gt; 5/4 or something close to it being appropriate in harmonic<br/>&gt; timbres for this specific style. A fine point as to &quot;period of<br/>&gt; composition&quot; is that whether a piece is composed in 1555 or 2005,<br/>&gt; if it follows this style (fairly well defined by the usual rules<br/>&gt; of 16th-century counterpoint and harmony), then my argument would<br/>&gt; apply.<br/>&gt;<br/>Well.. If I&apos;m allowed to put &quot;style&quot; under &quot;historically correct&quot;, then we actually have no disagreement!</p><p>&gt; &gt; I say this is in the ears of the beholder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is clearly true!<br/>&gt;<br/>Again, this seems to indicate we have no disagreement! :)</p><p>&gt; From my point of view, apart from<br/>&gt; the fact that these are not in 16th-century style, and more<br/>&gt; specifically in a slower note-against-style, possible factors<br/>&gt; could include timbre, tempo, rules of counterpoint, etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well I thought we had theoretical disagreement on the use of Pythagorean vs meantone in an objective way, as if Pythagorean would express something different in a musical way than meantone.<br/>Timbral differences and historical style differences I agree with fully (as long as I can put this part of &quot;style&quot; under historical authenticity, and not as an objective quality implied by the very notes of the music).<br/>I therefore defended Pythagorean strongly, something which I&apos;ve come to expect to have to do in tuning circles. However I see now that this may not have been needed :)<br/>If there is still some question if Pythagorean can play 16th-century style music and express it convincingly, I&apos;m more than willing to tune a piece to meantone and Pythagorean to give a good comparison. If so, would you happen to know of a piece in proper 16th century style of which the MIDI is available somewhere online, and preferably one which does not use more than 12 enharmonics per octave?

Why anybody would object to them is beyond me.<br/>Must have been some extremely conservative (and possibly even stupid) guy to have done so.<br/>And it&apos;s not a matter of spelling either. To write a major third where he wrote a diminished fourth would have been clearly wrong, not how the music works, and would have then in the first instance have given an augmented second instead of a minor third in a place where a minor third is clearly called for, etc.</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Marcel</p><p>&gt; Dear Marcel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for the tuning demonstration, which allows comparisons<br/>&gt; based on both tuning and timbre, and which I hope various people<br/>&gt; will try and comment upon over the next few days.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should back online early next week, and will be interested<br/>&gt; to see what the response has been, as well to offer my own<br/>&gt; reaction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the meantime, thank you for a cordial dialogue which may<br/>&gt; have set issues and perspectives in a better light, as well<br/>&gt; as provided an opportunity for others to judge and share<br/>&gt; their own responses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In response to your question, Monteverdi&apos;s use of the<br/>&gt; diminished fourth crticized by Artusi occurs in the<br/>&gt; madrigal _Era la anima mea_ (Fifth Book of Madrigals,<br/>&gt; 1605), with some of the pieces known before publication.<br/>&gt; Claude Palisca places the passages at measures 28-29<br/>&gt; (quinto part) and 58-9 (tenor part).
