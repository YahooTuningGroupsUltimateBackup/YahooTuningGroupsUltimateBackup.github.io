First, it is true that the Nyquist<br/>Theorem states that you only need a sampling rate two times the highest<br/>frequency to preserve all frequency information up to that frequency.<br/>However, in a real digital recording/playback system, there has to be some<br/>filtering on the output. A so-called anti-imaging filter is necessary in<br/>order to prevent artifacts higher than the Nyquist being reproduced (even<br/>though they were not recorded). Early CD players had analog filters with<br/>extremely sharp roll-offs, resulting in much less than a full frequency<br/>response up to the Nyquist and phase distorion. This made them sound<br/>relatively &quot;harsh&quot; and &quot;grainy.&quot;</p><p>However, with the advent of oversampling and MASH anti-imaging, few if any<br/>of these artifacts are perceptible anymore. (Much more of a problem are the<br/>awful analog opamps used in many consumer CD players.) There is a recent<br/>trend among some sound engineers to work at 96K sampling rates, sampling<br/>down only when mastering to CD. Though there could possibly be some benefit<br/>to this if there is a lot of DSP going on in the mix, I have yet to see any<br/>hard data that this practice has any audible benefit.</p><p>Of course, the standard CD sampling rate is 44.1K, an odd number bullied<br/>through the IEEE committee by Sony to support their early video-based PCM<br/>recorders. The IEEE preferred 48K, which was retained on digital<br/>multitracks. The DAT standard specifies several possible sampling rates,<br/>including 48K and 44.1K. However, because of crazy US laws, it is<br/>impossible to buy a &quot;consumer&quot; DAT deck that records at 44.1K, though all<br/>of them play back at both rates. &quot;Professional&quot; decks record at both.</p><p>The other standards CoolEdit mentions are of course analog, and those are<br/>simply the rough equivalent sampling rates to the top of the frequency<br/>response of those media. However, the actual frequency responses vary<br/>widely and are much more of a continuous curve. That said, I think<br/>CoolEdit&apos;s numbers are rather generous.</p><p>It is possible that the relationship of the recorded frequencies to the<br/>sampling rate can have audible effects (intermodulation distortion,<br/>resulting in combination tones), though Dan Wolf&apos;s anecdotes are the only<br/>evidence I&apos;ve heard of that these artifacts are audible down in musical<br/>frequency ranges (say, the range of the piano). Most texts present them as<br/>only audible when close to the Nyquist itself. Of course, Dan records some<br/>highly specialized music, and I&apos;ve never had a problem with this.</p><p>I&apos;ve also recorded and synthesized quite a few noisy sources, including<br/>cymbals, and I&apos;ve never had any trouble with frequency content above 1/3 to<br/>1/4 the sampling rate (at least with modern anti-imaging filters). If you<br/>have any references of studies of this effect, let me know.</p><p>Of course, sampling rate is only part of the equation. The other main part<br/>is the bit depth (number of bits per sample), which determines<br/>signal-to-error ratio and thus dynamic range. Other issues include dither<br/>and granulation noise, and all are discussed well in Ken Pohlmann&apos;s books<br/>on digital audio.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
