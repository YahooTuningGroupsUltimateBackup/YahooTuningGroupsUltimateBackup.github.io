I don&apos;t think it&apos;s productive to set a hard cap on it,<br/>just like there&apos;s no hard cap on what limits are acceptable or what<br/>amount of tuning badness is acceptable. People will explore the<br/>subgroups which are useful and ignore the ones which aren&apos;t. We need<br/>not worry about the 2.2025 subgroup any more than we need to worry<br/>about the 171-limit, but if for some reason somebody wants to work<br/>with it, this will allow them a framework to do so.</p><p>However, I note that, despite there being no theoretical upper bound<br/>on what limits are allowed, the &quot;free market&quot; has so far mostly stuck<br/>with the 13-limit and below, with occasional moments where you&apos;ll see<br/>17 and 19 in there. So I&apos;d expect the same will happen will subgroups,<br/>and that people will mostly care about subgroups which are generated<br/>by, at most, 13-odd-limit intervals.</p><p>&gt; Then you could explain how you know archy should be called<br/>&gt; superpyth rather than dominant or archy.</p><p>Basically, I&apos;m modeling this after the &quot;temperament family&quot; system<br/>that had on your old website, which Carl&apos;s now mirroring at <a href="http://lumma.org">lumma.org</a>.<br/>I dunno if you&apos;re the one who first started thinking in terms of<br/>families, and I know Paul hates it, but that&apos;s what I like. The only<br/>thing I want to change is that your system always goes from 2.3.5 to<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> to 2.3.5.7.11 and so on, because I don&apos;t think it&apos;s<br/>theoretically justified to rule out 2.3.7 &quot;parent&quot; temperaments with<br/><a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a> children as well, or 2.3.5 temperaments with <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a><br/>children.</p><p>Having to routinely name subgroup children of parent temperaments<br/>isn&apos;t really something I expect we&apos;ll have to do with the system I&apos;m<br/>proposing. In my world, we&apos;d have always started off by naming things<br/>like 2.3.7 64/63 and 2.3.11 243/242, because they&apos;re ultra-important,<br/>fundamental temperaments, and we&apos;d have been looking at things like<br/>7-limit superpyth and 11-limit mohajira as extensions of them, and<br/>there&apos;d be no problem. However, that&apos;s not what we did, because this<br/>whole subgroup business is new. So what I&apos;m trying to do now is to go<br/>back in time and pretend like we did it that way from the beginning.</p><p>It&apos;s consistent with this subgroup-oriented generalization of your own<br/>family structure to call 2.3.7 64/63 &quot;superpyth&quot; and then have the<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 64/63 245/243 temperament be an &quot;extension&quot; which is also<br/>called &quot;superpyth.&quot; You could do the same with &quot;dominant&quot; too. It&apos;s<br/>the same as calling 2.3.5 81/80 &quot;meantone&quot; and having <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 81/80<br/>126/125 also be &quot;meantone&quot;. I hope this concept is simple and doesn&apos;t<br/>lead to any confusion.</p><p>So given all that, you&apos;re now asking why we should call it superpyth<br/>and not dominant or archy. I don&apos;t think we have a reason to invent a<br/>new name like archy because the whole reason to invent a new name for<br/>it came out of the notion that if we called it superpyth the world<br/>would explode, but that&apos;s not the case. So between superpyth and<br/>dominant, there&apos;s no real reason to pick superpyth other than the fact<br/>that everyone already calls it superpyth; that&apos;s the unofficial name<br/>that most people are using. So since that&apos;s as good a name as any, I<br/>vote superpyth.</p><p>Again, keep in mind that this whole having to retcon names to fit the<br/>family system is just to get the engines started as a way to set<br/>things right. Once you have all the important &quot;parent&quot; subgroup<br/>temperaments named, you&apos;re just back to naming extensions like we<br/>already do now.</p><p>&gt; When is a non-p-limit subgroup allowed to grab the name?</p><p>In the paradigm I&apos;m proposing, this is the same question as &quot;when is<br/>an extension of a temperament allowed to grab the name?&quot; For instance,<br/>why isn&apos;t there an 11-limit sensi, but there&apos;s an 11-limit sensor and<br/>sensus and so on? We currently don&apos;t have any systematic way to answer<br/>that question: we&apos;ve simply been using our judgment in an ad hoc way.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2012 4:45:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 4:18 PM, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You could start by telling me what kind of subgroups you allow into this<br/>&gt; &gt; naming scheme.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of them.</p><p>So you&apos;re OK with sentry being called sensi?</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2012 6:34:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Jul 12, 2012, at 7:45 PM, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, Jul 12, 2012 at 4:18 PM, genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You could start by telling me what kind of subgroups you allow into this<br/>&gt; &gt; naming scheme.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of them.</p><p>So you&apos;re OK with sentry being called sensi?</p><p>I don&apos;t get it.
