First of all, because it&apos;s the same under inversion, its indispensable for connecting different substitutions between tonal chords. This is where it&apos;s beauty lies, in context and not as a chord in itself. For eg, the &apos;turnaround&apos; I VI II V7 as Cma7 A7 Dmi7 G7 becomes Cma7 C#dim7 Dmi7 Ddim7, or since the Emi group substitutes for the C (secondary relative minor), Emi7 Edim7 Dmi7 Ddim7 and so on. On the guitar for eg this gives dominant chords that are always close to any chord voicing we wish to choose because the dim&apos;s are all over the neck.</p><p>Then there is also the beautiful beating harmonies we get when we play these against the bass. If the bass player plays a G and the piano/guitar a Ddim7 we get a nice G7(b9). Over this a soloist can play a variety of scales, jazz diminished (basically Ab dim scale over G bass), Jazz melodic minor (an ascending Ab melodic minor over G bass) and so on. Other standard substitutions are the 7(b5) which descends chromatically when cycling. Since A7(b5) is enharmonically equivalent to Eb7(b5) our turnaround becomes Emi9, Eb9(b5), Dmin9, Db9(b5) for one example.</p><p>In jazz we want *options* for constant and quick variation, and it is not necessarily about dwelling on the niceties of how this or that chord sounds by itself, especially not on synthetised instruments over long durations. It is a bout playing and impro and in this respect the 12 ET system does pretty good IMO.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=90886 href="#90886">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2010 6:44:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I kind of got a bit side-tracked from what I was saying about the many uses of the diminished 7 chord in jazz harmony.

As I said, it&apos;s use is as a conjunctive between keys. It&apos;s &apos;oily&apos; character comes from the fact that it is or is sufficiently close to the 4th root of 2. Even (6/5)^4 is closer to 2 than the JI tuning given. There is also those wonderful beats you get when you play it with clashing upper harmonics like on a piano (not with sine waves in isolation). So even if Bach played slightly different tunings of this, it is still close enough for it to have this character. And there&apos;s nothing boring about his music. I was also going to say that xenharmonia and alternate tunings are not necessarily synonymous. If we are going to explore alternate tunings to 12 tET then it&apos;s not too much to ask to have at least some understanding of it, and not to replay history by trying to turn everything into JI or fly off into the void of infinite possibilities (which also ends up being all the same, i.e. boring.

My point was that its not a chord &apos;unto itself&apos; but has many many uses. I did listen to yours and they sound pretty good to my ears. But even assuming that they sound better than 12 tET, you would still have to overcome the problem that the 12 tET system is very practical for writing/performing music with modulations. It has been said that composers like Bach, Beethoven were so prolific because they practically improvised their music on the keyboard and then wrote it down for orchestra etc...They had to be. In this respect they really are like jazz musicians. And although some people might not like to hear it, but need to, practising and studying for years and years on end to become fluent on an instrument does help to sort the wheat from the chaff. It teaches for example that music constantly *moves forward*. In order to improvise or compose prolifically, the options have to be quick and immediate and if one dwells on mistakes or small tuning errors then the music goes on without you.

My point was that its not a chord &apos;unto<br/>&gt; itself&apos; but has many many uses. I did listen to yours and they sound pretty<br/>&gt; good to my ears. But even assuming that they sound better than 12 tET, you<br/>&gt; would still have to overcome the problem that the 12 tET system is very<br/>&gt; practical for writing/performing music with modulations. It has been said<br/>&gt; that composers like Bach, Beethoven were so prolific because they<br/>&gt; practically improvised their music on the keyboard and then wrote it down<br/>&gt; for orchestra etc...They had to be. In this respect they really are like<br/>&gt; jazz musicians. And although some people might not like to hear it, but need<br/>&gt; to, practising and studying for years and years on end to become fluent on<br/>&gt; an instrument does help to sort the wheat from the chaff.

Even though I can&apos;t tell you exactly how this&apos;ll work, I can tell<br/>that it does not need to be a mathematical impossibility.<br/>Just like crazy things can be done in one key (all 3 drei equale in one key<br/>without a single modulation), if one allows the mathematics of the 2 chains<br/>of fifths be the judge of exactly when the modulation happends then there is<br/>no problem.<br/>And you&apos;ll find that the diminished 7th is indeed a perfectly ok chord that<br/>can live in 2 &quot;keys&quot; at once in many circumstances (as are many other<br/>chords).</p><p>It will only be when you are playing a diminished 7th for instance, in a<br/>specific location in the key, and then modulate to a different key that<br/>doesn&apos;t have the transposed version of this same diminished 7th in the same<br/>inversion, at a moment not by choice of the &quot;scale mathematics&quot; but at an<br/>artificial moment of choice by the artist/composer, that a mathematical<br/>problem can arrise.<br/>These are a lot of &quot;if&apos;s&quot;.

Staunch JIists completely fail to distinguish between tonal and atonal (pantonal) chords. Only the former have their basis in JI and the harmonic series. For an example of atonality, look at the related b5 interval as Srt2 or a &quot;2 EDO&quot;. JI tried to avoid this for centuries, calling it the &quot;Devil&apos;s interval&quot; etc...This discomfort with irrationals goes way back to Pythagoras when he discovered that the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of sides 1 was sqrt 2 and not a rational. Musically this was emancipated with both the blues and also (eventually) serialism. Mathematically it led to the new number system of the set of reals. It&apos;s the *only* interval that is the same under 8ve inversion; sqrt2/1 = 2/sqrt2. Since each note stands precisely in the same relation to the other then, at least theoretically, it doesn&apos;t have a tonic.</p><p>However, this is to be distinguished between the #11 which *is* a tonal chord. maj7(#11) is one example (Cma7(#11) has C-E-G-D-F#-A for eg). This is completely separate from say C7(b5) which is enharmonically equal to Gb7(b5) (C-E-Gb-Bb). In 12 EDO the b5 and #11 *just so happen* to be the same note. But they are born from a very different tree, #11 is JI, b5 is EDO. EDO&apos;s appear wherever the music is passing *between* keys or roots, and dim7 is just one example. In contrast we have tonal chords which sound like they have arrived or landed.</p><p>Knowing that the word &quot;jass&quot; was a euphemism for sex, that pianists were hired to improvise in brothels, it&apos;s really not surprising that the b5 and its derivatives like dim7 now hold an important place in jazz music.

It becomes problematic when these two worlds merge together. However, in the original debate (which actually started probably a year ago), Marcel was trying to retune a Beethoven piece in terms of JI where he (Beethoven) was using allot of &apos;puns&apos; or ambiguities on the diminished chord. The II V7 I in the minor key was using half-diminished (i.e. say Dmi7(b5), D-F-Ab-C in the key of C min) to diminished (G7 becomes D diminished, D-F-Ab-B with only one note difference from the half dim) to I minor C-Eb-G. Marcel&apos;s tuning sounded good until it hit these types of chords. He&apos;s since found other tunings that are closer to the tempered minor third for these chords and it now sounds fine (although my original idea that 19/16 is the closest I still think is correct because four of these almost hits the 8ve).</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=90981 href="#90981">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2010 9:16:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What &quot;clear theoretical distinction&quot;?

Saying RI is necessary but not sufficient for JI is saying &quot;if p, then q&quot;; if we wanted to say RI is necessary and sufficient, we&apos;d say &quot;p if and only if q&quot;.  Now, the statement &quot;music is tempered&quot; can simply be written &quot;music is not in rational intonation&quot;, i.e. &quot;not q&quot;, unless you want to allow that tempered music can be in rational intonation (which I&apos;m assuming you don&apos;t want to allow).  Now, we have two premises:<br/>1. if p, then q<br/>2. not q<br/>The conclusion is &quot;therefore, not p&quot;, since &quot;if p, then q&quot; equates to &quot;q or not p&quot;, and since we can affirm &quot;not q&quot;, we have only &quot;not p&quot; left.</p><p>Thus, if music is not rational, it is also not Just.  This doesn&apos;t tell us about sufficient conditions for being Just, but that&apos;s okay, because it at least excludes irrational (i.e. tempered) intervals.</p><p>So, the line between tempering and JI is at least RI, since JI is just a special subset of RI.  Whether this line defines an audible difference or not is moot to the theoretical definition, since of course any ratio can be approximated with arbitrary closeness by an irrational, and any irrational can be approximated with arbitrary closeness by a rational (the key word being &quot;approximated&quot;).  If we allowed &quot;arbitrarily close to&quot; to be logically-equivalent to &quot;the same as&quot;, of course the distinction would vanish, but the whole point is that we DON&apos;T, and this is how JI maintains its identity from tempered music.  Maybe we SHOULD allow this, but that&apos;s a different argument, because I&apos;m pretty sure we currently DON&apos;T.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=90982 href="#90982">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2010 10:41:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh what&apos;s real funny..<br/>&gt; &gt; If you listen to all the version and than as last one 12edo.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s crazy how out of tune 12edo sounds then :)<br/>&gt; &gt; Strong loss of clarity aswell.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Marcel<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I ment to say, was.<br/>&gt; That Pythagorean used in this way, and 53edo are very very good compared to<br/>&gt; 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel<br/>&gt;<br/>They all sound pretty much in tune to me Marcel including the 12-EDO.

People were not using JI when this term was invented, and even in circulating temperaments the tritone was not going to be exactly sqrt(2). In meantone, of course, the augmented fourth and diminished fifth are two different intervals.</p><p>Well I probably tend to think of whole-numberedness and JI being the same thing. What perhaps I should have said was that the b5 was strictly forbidden in traditional counterpoint.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This discomfort with irrationals goes way back to Pythagoras when he discovered that the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of sides 1 was sqrt 2 and not a rational.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pythagoras probably did not discover this. Hippasus seems to be the leading candidate.</p><p>Yeah this is a fuzzy area. I&apos;ve read that it&apos;s possible that Pyth himself did the reductio proof that a/b = sqrt2. But one of my close friends who&apos;s a classical Greek scholar says that the Greeks would often create legendary characters and then write the &apos;evidence&apos; of their existence in order to back their claims. Like Homer, it&apos;s even possible that a real person named Pythagoras never existed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Musically this was emancipated with both the blues and also (eventually) serialism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Long, long before that.</p><p>Again I should have perhaps said &quot;fully emancipated&quot; or something. Of course Mozart is full of diminisheds etc...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;EDO&apos;s appear wherever the music is passing *between* keys or roots, and dim7 is just one example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They do? How do they magically appear?</p><p>I think of this more of a law of harmony. There is no way in the world you can tell me that ending on a diminished or augmented chord sounds &apos;complete&apos; or that a C maj triad sounds like its modulating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JIists would have us all bopping to the Gregorian chant!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah, that Harry Partch. Wild for Gregorian chant.</p><p>That was before his death metal phase.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you ever looked at 22? Like 12, it tempers out 50/49, and so sqrt(2) is used for both 7/5 and 10/7 in septimal harmony. It seems amenable to jazz.<br/>&gt;<br/>No I haven&apos;t. I&apos;ll check it out. The problem with extending microtonality to jazz performance is the instruments or non-existence thereof and the fact that most pro&apos;s are so fluent on their instruments that changing their ways would be like learning a new language. There&apos;s also the problem of a formalised, common language which is needed for people to impro together (you play *this* scale over *that* chord etc...). Formalise microtonality and give it a generation or two and it should start to take hold.</p></div><h3><a id=90984 href="#90984">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2010 11:22:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>They all sound pretty much in tune to me Marcel including the 12-EDO.

I just can&apos;t help the feeling that by focusing too much on these tiny subtleties one can miss the point that composers like Bach Beethoven had bombastic personalities. Sometimes Beethoven would deliberately introduce notes that sound out of tune until we heard what was to follow. The introduction of the French horn in the Eroica is a perfect example. Upon hearing it, his student stood up and told off the orchestra. Beethoven then told him off and for the orchestra to continue. We then hear that this &apos;out of tune&apos; theme becomes the new motif for an entire new movement. As for Bach, (ah, Bach), he was also a great swordsman. After berating his musicians for being lazy they attacked him and he beat them off with a sword.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=91020 href="#91020">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2010 12:04:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;JI is a set of interval relationships which are represented exactly by integer frequency ratios, wherein no number in any of the ratios exceeds a given size.&quot;</p><p>I have no objection to this definition, if labeled as such, but of course it concedes the point at issue, which is that there is no clear line.</p><p>&gt; Now I&apos;d like to know how you define the terms &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;tempered&quot;, since clearly you believe they can be meaningfully defined without being mutually exclusive.</p><p>My point originally was that there was no universally accepted definition of &quot;just&quot; which draws a clear demarcation between just and not just.

I&apos;ve never heard of one. There is a clear theoretical distinction between rational intonation and allowing irrationals, but this can&apos;t be used to define &quot;just&quot; in some theoretical sense since every odd prime limit is dense in the positive reals. What you are saying seems to be that JI must be RI, but that&apos;s a necessary condition which can&apos;t be a sufficent one.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t *have to be* a sufficient condition.  Look, let&apos;s convert this to sentential logic to make it clearer.  Let p = &quot;Music is in Just Intonation&quot;, and let q = &quot;Music is in Rational Intonation&quot;.  Saying RI is necessary but not sufficient for JI is saying &quot;if p, then q&quot;; if we wanted to say RI is necessary and sufficient, we&apos;d say &quot;p if and only if q&quot;.  Now, the statement &quot;music is tempered&quot; can simply be written &quot;music is not in rational intonation&quot;, i.e. &quot;not q&quot;, unless you want to allow that tempered music can be in rational intonation (which I&apos;m assuming you don&apos;t want to allow).  Now, we have two premises:<br/>&gt; 1. if p, then q<br/>&gt; 2. not q<br/>&gt; The conclusion is &quot;therefore, not p&quot;, since &quot;if p, then q&quot; equates to &quot;q or not p&quot;, and since we can affirm &quot;not q&quot;, we have only &quot;not p&quot; left.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus, if music is not rational, it is also not Just.  This doesn&apos;t tell us about sufficient conditions for being Just, but that&apos;s okay, because it at least excludes irrational (i.e. tempered) intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, the line between tempering and JI is at least RI, since JI is just a special subset of RI.  Whether this line defines an audible difference or not is moot to the theoretical definition, since of course any ratio can be approximated with arbitrary closeness by an irrational, and any irrational can be approximated with arbitrary closeness by a rational (the key word being &quot;approximated&quot;).  If we allowed &quot;arbitrarily close to&quot; to be logically-equivalent to &quot;the same as&quot;, of course the distinction would vanish, but the whole point is that we DON&apos;T, and this is how JI maintains its identity from tempered music.  Maybe we SHOULD allow this, but that&apos;s a different argument, because I&apos;m pretty sure we currently DON&apos;T.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Igs,</p><p>Concerning physics, although the others are by now sick of hearing it, I&apos;ve recently been working on a theory which shows that the GCD&apos;s or periodic waves i.e. their frequency, remain when we detune notes. The standard example I&apos;ve been giving is that if we take a Fourier series between the just major third 80/64 = 5/4, which has peaks at the GCD frequency 16, and detune it to the Pythagorean maj 3rd 81/64, then the peaks of this wave will occur at the approximate GCD frequency (81 + 64)/(5 + 4) = 16.1111...Without going into detail, the upshot is that non-JI waves can be seen simply as JI waves with a modulated amplitude (observe for eg that the denominator is (5 + 4), where 5/4 is its JI counterpart). You can see some of the results in my files folder.</p><p>I&apos;ll just say that when we frame the problems in terms of the correct physical approach, wave theory, then most of them either have a clear answer or disappear of their own accord. For eg, I used to think that because the b5 as sqrt 2 was irrational and had no GCD, then it cannot have a frequency and must therefore be &apos;atonal&apos;. However, by looking at the actual waves I now realise that it does have an approximate GCD close to 7/5. Therefore, trying to draw a distinct line in the sand between JI and non-JI, rationals and irrationals, might be flawed from the outset.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=91023 href="#91023">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2010 12:50:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yeah Igs, what you say here &quot;Tonal 12-tET music can probably be retuned to JI, but the skeleton gets deformed&quot; is exactly what I was saying. Pure theorists often don&apos;t realise that the &apos;heart&apos; of modern 12 EDO tonal harmony is not based on tuning the fifths but on what we call *guide tones* between the thirds and sevenths, which invert as we cycle. It is these which &apos;spell out&apos; the chord and the fifths are quite dispensable. It starts by noticing that as we cycle using dom7 chords the tritone between the maj 3 and b7 descends chromatically, inverting each time. C7 - F7 - Bb7 -...has guide tones (E, Bb) - (Eb, A) - (D, Ab) -...where it&apos;s seen that maj3 is flattened to become b7 and b7 is flattened to become maj3.</p><p>We then modify these to match the chord progression in question. Eg Cmi7 - F7 - Bbmaj7 has guide tones (Eb, Bb) - (Eb, A) - (D, A). Notice that the chords are perfectly spelled out but with absolute minimal voice movement. This is vital for both efficiency in composing and improvising. If I score for sax and trombone for eg and want to spell out the chords I&apos;ll automatically choose these notes.</p><p>Once you start detuning away from this tritone &quot;skeleton&quot; you are going to run into trouble. Sure it&apos;s possible, but why do it just because of some old idea that tempered systems don&apos;t match some Platonic ideal of &apos;Pure whole-numbers&apos;? In truth, instruments have never matched these exactly anyway. String/pipe length, thickness, temperature are all factors that make things only approximate anyway.</p><p>-Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Rick,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yeah I completely agree. 12 EDO harmony uses the same set of notes but in entirely different ways, one tonal and the other symmetric. It becomes problematic when these two worlds merge together.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, because &quot;12-EDO harmony&quot; is not what common-practice music is based on.  The skeleton of common-practice music is the spiral of relatively-pure fifths; that is how notes are named, that is how key-signatures are derived, and really all a note-name tells you is a note&apos;s position on the spiral of fifths.  Puns arise in 12-EDO because a spiral is being approximated by a circle, and notes which &quot;should&quot; be distinct (occupying different places on the spiral) become the same, forming an enharmonic equivalent.  However, any music written in 12-EDO using diatonic note names (A thru G, with various sharps and flats) is NOT essentially 12-EDO music, because it does not require the symmetry/equality of 12-EDO in order to make sense, it only requires a series of reasonably-pure fifths (presumably which do not &quot;close&quot; as a circle at any fewer than 12 notes).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tonal 12-tET music can probably be retuned to JI, but the skeleton gets deformed since 5-limit or higher JI is not based on a 1-dimensional spiral of fifths (nor on a circle of fifths); hence Marcel&apos;s mathematical acrobatics and use of complex intervals like 40/27 and whatever that minor third with the huge numbers was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the biggest confusion comes from jazz, which often uses the same terminology as tonal 12-EDO music in spite of the fact that the circle of fifths is usually much less relevant than the symmetrical arrangement of 12 tones.  Since jazz disobeys almost all the standard rules of tonality, notating a &quot;jazz&quot; Cdim7 as C-Eb-Gb-Bbb could make the same amount of sense as C-Eb-F#-A.  Each spelling suggests a different JI interpretation, but because neither spelling is any more &quot;accurate&quot; than the other, there&apos;s no argument for either JI interpretation, so retuning it to JI would make about as much sense as trying to retune a serialist piece.  Not to say you can&apos;t play jazz or serialism in JI, of course, just that there&apos;s no basis for a &quot;proper&quot; retuning of 12-EDO jazz or serialism into JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=91024 href="#91024">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2010 1:09:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You said that before, and it&apos;s still wrong.

Any series of seven reasonably-pure fifths will do to produce a diatonic scale.  Notes were initially defined one-dimensionally; E is not &quot;E&quot; because it&apos;s a major third of C, but because it&apos;s a fifth of A, which is a fifth of D, which is a fifth of G, which is a fifth of C.

The skeleton that gets deformed by forcing 5-limit JI is that backbone of fifths, because when you make E a pure 5/4, it is no longer related to C by a chain of fifths.  And as we all know, the point of temperament was (among other things) to push the harmony of C-E toward 5/4 without losing the relationship of the chain of fifths, as well as to turn the spiral of pure fifths into a closed circle, so that more keys are accessible without adding notes spaced only a comma apart.  But the point is, it has to be fifths, and it has to be a series of them, or else you are abandoning the framework of diatonic music.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91027 href="#91027">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2010 2:34:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Yeah what you say here is definitely true. I used to play a Bach fugue in Emin that was transcribed by Segovia from cello. I forgot allot of it so I went to the music shop to buy it. But when I got it home it had the same motif and counterpoint opening but was a different piece entirely. And I&apos;ve since heard yet a third version. Even in my own experience I can compose a theme or section and sit on it for years until I find where to put it. Sometimes it pops out of nowhere while I&apos;m mucking around, other times it takes years of fiddling to get it right. OTOH no one would doubt that they were both virtuoso performers, Bach at least on a variety of instruments. What I&apos;m saying to Marcel is that being able to write for instruments does require knowing something about how they&apos;re played, their range, transposition etc...We wouldn&apos;t do a B-A# trill on a trombone for eg since they are at opposite ends of the slide. And there&apos;s no substitute for experience. At any rate, the line between composition and impro, discovery and creativity, is never that clear cut.</p><p>-Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You said that before, and it&apos;s still wrong.

I used to play a Bach fugue in Emin that was transcribed by Segovia from cello. I forgot allot of it so I went to the music shop to buy it. But when I got it home it had the same motif and counterpoint opening but was a different piece entirely. And I&apos;ve since heard yet a third version. Even in my own experience I can compose a theme or section and sit on it for years until I find where to put it. Sometimes it pops out of nowhere while I&apos;m mucking around, other times it takes years of fiddling to get it right. OTOH no one would doubt that they were both virtuoso performers, Bach at least on a variety of instruments. What I&apos;m saying to Marcel is that being able to write for instruments does require knowing something about how they&apos;re played, their range, transposition etc...We wouldn&apos;t do a B-A# trill on a trombone for eg since they are at opposite ends of the slide.

Pure theorists often don&apos;t realise that the &apos;heart&apos; of modern 12 EDO tonal harmony is not based on tuning the fifths but on what we call *guide tones* between the thirds and sevenths, which invert as we cycle.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, I should have left out &quot;12-tET&quot; from that sentence.  I don&apos;t understand really anything about these guide-tones you talk about, but the fact remains that diatonic music as we know it originated from tuning systems based on a series of fifths.  Any series of seven reasonably-pure fifths will do to produce a diatonic scale.  Notes were initially defined one-dimensionally; E is not &quot;E&quot; because it&apos;s a major third of C, but because it&apos;s a fifth of A, which is a fifth of D, which is a fifth of G, which is a fifth of C.  The fact that E is a major third above C is really a contingency of the way approximately-pure fifths work.  The skeleton that gets deformed by forcing 5-limit JI is that backbone of fifths, because when you make E a pure 5/4, it is no longer related to C by a chain of fifths.  And as we all know, the point of temperament was (among other things) to push the harmony of C-E toward 5/4 without losing the relationship of the chain of fifths, as well as to turn the spiral of pure fifths into a closed circle, so that more keys are accessible without adding notes spaced only a comma apart.  But the point is, it has to be fifths, and it has to be a series of them, or else you are abandoning the framework of diatonic music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>Yeah I get that Igs. But my point was that despite its initial motivation of closing off the fifths, it inadvertently created a new set of rules or connections that evolved on its own.

In Baroque times it was OK, music for different instruments, vocals, choirs looked the same in the score.

In reality, most composers use only a relatively small<br/>bag of tricks no matter what &quot;style&quot; they&apos;re writing in.<br/>Beethoven invented romantic music and Bach&apos;s music is probably<br/>the most recognizable of any composer.</p><p>&gt; From Czech composers for example Zelenka, Myslivecek,<br/>&gt; Dusik, Rejcha, Erwin Schulhoff, Korngold...</p><p>I&apos;m a big Zelenka fan.</p><p>&gt; Funny enough, such reason for fame, but if it can somebody<br/>&gt; fire for deeper interest in Janacek, why not...</p><p>I like Janacek.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=91089 href="#91089">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2010 3:50:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Yeah I get that Igs.
