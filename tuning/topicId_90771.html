Computer time was scarce and expensive (several hundred dollars an hour), but I used to get a few free minutes at the end of every quarter when people who had unused time on their grants donated it to students lest it be subtracted from their next allotment.  Most of the time I compiled large tuning tables of ETs and extended high-prime JI for Erv Wilson.

Now I got a few seconds of mainframe time in the 60s because my younger brother was a CS major (a brand new idea at the time) and had lots of fun with the printout.
