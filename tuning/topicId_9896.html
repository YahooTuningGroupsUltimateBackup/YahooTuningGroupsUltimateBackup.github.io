This piece (along with &quot;Day Walks In&quot; and<br/>&quot;One Step From The Street&quot; which are already up at the TuningPunk<br/>site) is a track from a CD in waiting with my group PRIVATEWORLD<br/>(myself, 3-Handman, Scott Dakota, and Shawn Briggs).</p><p>&quot;WITH EYES SO BLUE AND DREAMING&quot;: A score demo of a chamber ensemble<br/>piece -- fl, 2 E hr/E hr ob/tpt E hn, cl, bn, hn, tbn, pf, bells, 2<br/>hp/hp hpsc, str qrt + opt vn -- in thirteen tone equal temperament. 13<br/>equal is often mentioned in the context of being a particularly<br/>&apos;difficult,&apos; or discordant EDO, but I&apos;ve used a variety of 7-tone<br/>scales in 13e that exploit the 3/13ths of an octave augmented second<br/>scale step (even a double augmented 4/13):</p><p>3 1 2 1 2 2 2<br/>3 1 3 1 2 1 2<br/>2 1 4 1 2 1 2</p><p>And I really find these scales in 13e to be _extremely beautiful, and<br/>to really heighten a sense of melancholic ache, or longing, that is<br/>somewhat akin to some of the Eastern European scales that also utilize<br/>the augmented second scale step.</p><p>&quot;DON&apos;T LEAVE ME HERE&quot;: A score demo of a polyintonational chamber<br/>ensemble piece -- vn, 2 va, E hr, ob/fl, pf, bells -- that combines<br/>20, 19, and 12 equal. The middle (or B section), is a sort of brief<br/>microtonally compressed reworking of Charles Ives&apos; &quot;At The River.&quot;</p><p>&quot;AT A DAY JOB&quot;: A score demo of a chamber ensemble piece -- tpt, bn,<br/>vc, db, pf, hp, 2 percussionists, bells (2 players), thermion/glass<br/>org, homemade instruments -- that uses a 22-tone set built on two<br/>overtone series, 10-20 and 14-28:</p><p>                 25/14<br/>                  / \<br/>                 /   \<br/>                /     \<br/>               /       \<br/>              /         \<br/>             /           \<br/>            /             \<br/>           /               \<br/>        10/7--------------15/14<br/>         / \               / \<br/>        /   \             /   \<br/>     19/14 11/7          /     \<br/>      /       \         /       \<br/>     /         \       /         \<br/>  17/14       23/14   /           \<br/>   /    ,1/1.----\---/----,3/2.    \<br/>  /  ,&apos;  / \ 13/7 \ /  ,&apos;  / \  &grave;.  \<br/>8/7&apos;----/---\---&grave;12/7&apos;----/---\----&grave;9/7--------------27/14<br/>     19/10 11/10         /     \<br/>      /       \         /       \<br/>     /         \       /         \<br/>  17/10         \     /           \<br/>   /    ,7/5.    \   /             \<br/>  /  ,&apos;      13/10\ /               \<br/>8/5&apos;-------------&grave;6/5---------------9/5</p><p>It is also loosely based on a set of American patriotic songs (most<br/>notably &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;).</p><p>The last three pieces -- &quot;WITH EYES SO BLUE AND DREAMING,&quot; &quot;DON&apos;T<br/>LEAVE ME HERE&quot; and &quot;AT A DAY JOB&quot; -- were originally grouped together<br/>as a microtonal chamber set as scherzo, assai appenato, montani semper<br/>liberi.</p><p>&quot;THE WAY I SEE YOU NOW&quot; and &quot;BLUE CARROUSEL&quot;: These are two pieces<br/>from a seven piece microtonal jazz set for turntable quartet that is<br/>realized here by PRIVATEWORLD DJ 3-Handman.</p><p>Dan Stearns</p></div>
