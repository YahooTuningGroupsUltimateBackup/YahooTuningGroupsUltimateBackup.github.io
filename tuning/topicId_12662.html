The title track uses two fascinating non-octave equal<br/>scales, &quot;Alpha&quot; (78 cents per step) and &quot;Beta&quot; (63.8 cents per step).</p><p>Another of my favorites is Easley Blackwood&apos;s CD &quot;Microtonal Compositions&quot;<br/>(Cedille records, CDR 90000 018). This features the &quot;Twelve Microtonal<br/>Etudes for Electronic Music Media&quot;, which explore the tonal possibilities<br/>of each of the equal-tempered scales from 13 to 24 notes per octave. The CD<br/>also includes &quot;Fanfare in 19-note Equal Tuning&quot; and &quot;Suite for Guitar in<br/>15-note Equal Tuning&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=12744 href="#12744">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2000 8:52:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Something else I would recommend.  Not a top-ten microtonal recording, but<br/>the person who likes brass and/or early music must not be without...</p><p>The Art of Baroque Trumpet, Vol 2.<br/>Niklas Eklund, baroque trumpet<br/>Knut Johannessen, organ<br/>Naxos 8.553593</p><p>Niki is one of the greatest artists playing the trumpet today.  The album<br/>features music by Fantini, Viviani, Frescobaldi, Sweelinck, Pezel, and the<br/>first &quot;period&quot; recordings of tunes by Prentzl and the German composer Lowe<br/>von Eisenach.  Good 5-limit just intonation is often achieved, and the organ<br/>is tuned in &quot;1/4 syntonic comma meantone&quot;.  Importantly, the performances<br/>are in the same good spirit as this sublime music.  And it&apos;s Naxos, which<br/>means you get good to excellent production for around $5 US.</p><p>The only Sweelinck tune is, rather predictably, the Chromatic Fantasia.<br/>Overplayed, this is still an awesome tune, and if you&apos;ve never heard it<br/>in meantone, you&apos;re in for a treat.</p><p>Then comes track 11, _Toccata settima_ by Michelangelo Rossi, which is my<br/>current pick for best showcase of meantone as a &quot;microtonal&quot; tuning.  And<br/>this is truely an astounding work, meantone or no.  Sounds like Bach&apos;s<br/>_Little Harmonic Labyrinth_ a 100 years ahead of schedule.</p><p>I never believed all that stuff about valveless horns sounding sweeter,<br/>but it&apos;s apparently true.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
