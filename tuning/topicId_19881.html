I&apos;ll try to do it without subdivisions, maybe one of the<br/>tests of &quot;simplicity.&quot;</p><p>$.$.$</p><p>Q. Why are there 12 notes per octave on typical keyboards?</p><p>A. The form of the typical European keyboard instrument seems to have<br/>evolved during the era from around 757, when the court of King Peppin<br/>of the Franks received an organ as a gift from the Byzantine Empire,<br/>to around the middle of the 14th century, when 12-note keyboards in<br/>the famous arrangement with seven diatonic or &quot;white&quot; keys and five<br/>accidental or &quot;black keys&quot; were becoming standard.</p><p>Here our focus is on the question: how did these keyboards come to<br/>have their familiar 14th-century arrangement, still standard in the<br/>12-key instruments of the early 21st century?</p><p>An equally important and revealing question, however, is &quot;Why stop at<br/>12 keys?&quot; As other portions of this FAQ discuss from various<br/>viewpoints, the best answer may be that a range of musicians over the<br/>last six centuries or a bit more _haven&apos;t_ stopped at 12, but have<br/>designed and often have actually built instruments with anything from<br/>13 to 31 or more notes per octave.</p><p>Let&apos;s also note that while the history of the familiar 12-note<br/>keyboard is largely an adventure in Western European musical styles<br/>and tastes, various musical cultures have leaned toward larger tuning<br/>systems. For example, some medieval Arabic or Persian traditions favor<br/>a 17-note system of a kind in some resembling that advocated in early<br/>15th-century Italy. Traditional Chinese theory recognizes sets of 53<br/>or more notes per octave.</p><p>With this bit of perspective, let&apos;s return to medieval Europe around<br/>the time of Charlemagne and his successors in the 9th century, a<br/>period celebrated by one poet as a kind of &quot;rebirth&quot; of Roman<br/>culture (scholars sometimes call this the Carolingean Renaissance).</p><p>A vital element in the cultural mix was music, with the treatise of<br/>the revered philosopher Boethius (c. 480-524) the basis for the<br/>learned study of this art. Boethius took a great interest in the<br/>theory of consonance and dissonance, and also in the ancient Greek<br/>authors and systems, especially those of Pythagoras (as recorded by<br/>his followers) and Ptolemy.</p><p>Like many world musics, the best-known Western European music of this<br/>time was based on a system of tuning in pure fifths and fourths, known<br/>in the West as Pythagorean tuning after the Greek philosopher<br/>Pythagoras. (Pythagoras, like many of the pre-Socratics, is known to<br/>us mainly by repute and by reported quotations or teachings written<br/>down by later authors). Scholars have suggested that the ancient<br/>Greeks may have borrowed it from a Babylonian tradition.</p><p>While both sacred and secular music were practiced in 9th-10th century<br/>Europe, and some writers such as Hucbald tell us a bit about popular<br/>instruments such as lyres or harps, we know mainly about music for the<br/>Church: both traditional chant, and a newly documented technique of<br/>_organum_ or &quot;organized&quot; part-music involving the concord of different<br/>notes sounding at the same time.</p><p>Medieval liturgical chant or plainsong uses a system of eight standard<br/>notes: the seven diatonic or &quot;white&quot; keys on a familiar keyboard, plus<br/>Bb. In other words, there are _two_ versions of the step Bb/B, and<br/>both may occur in certain chants.</p><p>In the Pythagorean tuning described by Boethius, and followed as<br/>standard practice, we can derive this usual set of eight notes for<br/>chant as a chain of seven pure fifths or fourths:</p><p>                   Bb  F  C  G  D  A  E  B</p><p>Early organs of this era seem often to have had these eight notes per<br/>octave, although the term &quot;keyboard&quot; might be misleading: these<br/>instruments had devices such as large sliders for opening or closing<br/>the wind supply to a pipe, so that two or more players might be<br/>needed, and the action was likely _slow_.</p><p>If we applied a layout like the modern ones, we might arrange the<br/>notes like this, with the &quot;black key&quot; Bb set apart from the others:</p><p>                                         Bb<br/>                   C    D    E  F   G   A   B  C</p><p>However, we will recall, both Bb and B were regarded as regular forms<br/>of the same scale step, so a layout with all eight notes on the same<br/>row was common, and still in use in some instruments of the 14th<br/>century:</p><p>                   C    D    E  F   G   A  Bb  B  C</p><p>In medieval Western Europe, as in many other world musics, fifths and<br/>fourths were favorite consonances: Boethius described their concordant<br/>effect, and during the period of around 850-1200, musicians developed<br/>more and more complex styles contrasting these stable intervals with a<br/>wide range of unstable ones having various degrees of concord or<br/>discord. Pythagorean tuning made the stable fifths and fourths pure,<br/>or ideally smooth and concordant, and produced an intriguing continuum<br/>of tension among the other intervals.</p><p>By around 1200, the great composer Perotin and his colleagues were<br/>writing pieces in the high Gothic style for three and four voices,<br/>using not only the traditional eight notes of most chant but other<br/>accidentals: Eb, F#, C#. These notes could also be added to an organ<br/>by extending the chain of fifths in either direction, for example in<br/>this ten-note chain:</p><p>                  Eb  Bb  F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F# C#</p><p>At about this same epoch, there was apparently a major technological<br/>breakthrough: at least some organs acquired agile keyboards of the<br/>modern kind, which allowed them to play the flowing and often<br/>ornamented melodic lines favored in the music of the time. A<br/>13th-century poem, the _Roman de la Rose_, tells us that small or<br/>portative organs could play either the supporting lower part or the<br/>florid upper melody of the sophisticated motets then in fashion,<br/>pieces artfully combining voices singing different texts.</p><p>Just how quickly and frequently some or all of the extra accidentals<br/>became standard on the limber keyboards of the 13th century is<br/>uncertain, but by 1325, the theorist Jacobus of Liege tells us that<br/>their diatonic whole-steps or major seconds were &quot;almost everywhere&quot;<br/>divided into two semitones. This comment become clearer if we look at<br/>a possible keyboard layout around 1300, using the 11 notes which had<br/>sometimes been in use for at least around a century:</p><p>                C#   Eb         F#         Bb<br/>            C      D     E   F     G     A      B   C</p><p>Here the seven diatonic notes form an octave with five whole-tones<br/>(C-D, D-E, F-G, G-A, A-B) and two semitones (E-F, B-C). Four of the<br/>five whole-tones have added accidentals dividing them into semitones:<br/>C-C#-D, D-Eb-E, F-F#-G, and A-Bb-B.</p><p>Given the special status of Bb as a &quot;regular&quot; note, it might also have<br/>been placed in the same row as the diatonic notes, giving us an<br/>arrangement of our eight &quot;regular&quot; notes plus three extra accidentals:</p><p>                C#   Eb         F#<br/>             C     D     E   F     G     A  Bb  B  C</p><p>By around this same epoch of 1300, a new and compelling argument for<br/>these extra keyboard accidentals was at hand: the preference for<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; at cadences or in other directed progressions where<br/>an unstable sonority moved to a stable one.</p><p>The basic rule, as stated by various 14th-century writers, is that a<br/>third expanding to a fifth, or a sixth to an octave, should be major;<br/>a third contracting to a unison should be minor. If they are not so<br/>naturally, then they should be altered by using accidentals. For<br/>example, a typical &quot;closest approach&quot; cadence on D might take two<br/>forms; here I use a notation showing middle C as &quot;C4,&quot; with higher<br/>numbers showing higher octaves:</p><p>    C#4 D4    C4  D4<br/>    G#3 A3    G3  A3<br/>    E3  D3    Eb3 D3</p><p>Either form features a major third between the lower two voices<br/>expanding to a fifth, and a major sixth between the outer two voices<br/>expanding to an octave. In the first solution, the two upper voices<br/>each ascend by a semitone; in the second, the lower voice descends by<br/>a semitone.</p><p>While the second form was available using the 11-note set known in<br/>13th-century compositions, the first form called for a 12th note,<br/>namely G#.</p><p>This first form was in fact much in demand, because in 14th-century<br/>style a cadence with ascending semitones was usually considered more<br/>conclusive than one with descending semitones, the latter form usually<br/>signalling a kind of musical &quot;halfway&quot; point rather than a final<br/>cadence.</p><p>Since pieces centered on the octave-type or mode of D-D were very<br/>common, final cadences with the major third E-G# expanding to the<br/>fifth D-A were routine in theory and practice.</p><p>Therefore, as a modern software developer might say, G# had found a<br/>&quot;compelling application&quot; -- in this case, an application calling for a<br/>modest hardware upgrade, the addition of a G# key.</p><p>Around 1325, the time Jacobus wrote about the semitones being divided<br/>&quot;almost everyone,&quot; this 12th note may have already been added on some<br/>instruments. The earliest known European compositions for keyboard,<br/>preserved in the Robertsbridge Codex with proposed dates anywhere from<br/>1325 to 1365, calls for all 12 notes of such a keyboard, with a chain<br/>of fifths very likely tuned like this, from Eb to G#:</p><p>                Eb  Bb  F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F#  C#  G#</p><p>However, as we might say, the &quot;user interface&quot; wasn&apos;t quite yet<br/>standardized. The scholar Mark Lindley shows how the 14th-century<br/>Noordlanda organ had an arrangement with the eight &quot;regular&quot; notes<br/>(including both B and Bb) on one row, and the complement of four<br/>&quot;extra&quot; notes on another:</p><p>                C#   Eb         F#    G#<br/>             C     D     E   F     G     A  Bb  B  C</p><p>At Halberstadt in 1361, however, it appears that the 12-note organ<br/>placed Bb in the row with the other accidentals, possibly with earlier<br/>unrecorded precedents, and this quickly prevailed as the &quot;standard&quot;<br/>arrangement:</p><p>                C#   Eb         F#    G#   Bb<br/>             C     D     E   F     G     A     B  C</p><p>Q. We know that there&apos;s no need to stop at 12, but why it is _one_<br/>attractive size for a keyboard tuning?</p><p>A. Here there may be a quick answer and a more involved answer. Let&apos;s<br/>take the quick one first.</p><p>In his encyclopedic treatise of 1325, Jacobus of Liege mentioned that<br/>keyboards &quot;almost everywhere&quot; divided diatonic whole-tones into two<br/>semitones by extra accidentals. With a 12-note instrument, as we can<br/>see on either the Noordlanda keyboard or the more familiar Halberstadt<br/>keyboard, _every_ whole-tone is divided into two semitones, including<br/>G-A (by the new 12th note G#). In all we have five such whole-tones,<br/>and five accidentals (counting Bb and the four &quot;extra&quot; ones) to do<br/>this dividing.</p><p>There&apos;s a certain cozy symmetry in this arrangement, not to mention<br/>that a Pythagorean chain from Eb to G# nicely covers the accidentals<br/>typically used in the great preponderance of 14th-century pieces for<br/>ensembles or keyboards, including the music of composers such as<br/>Guillaume de Machaut (1300-1377) and Francesco Landini (1325-1397).</p><p>The more involved answer looks at this feeling of &quot;coziness&quot; or<br/>&quot;balance&quot; more closely, and brings into the play an important concept<br/>of modern theorist Ervin Wilson: the idea of a Moment of Symmetry<br/>(MOS).</p><p>Such an &quot;MOS&quot; occurs when a tuning system has only two sizes of<br/>_adjacent_ intervals, that is, intervals between the pairs of notes<br/>immediately adjacent to each other.</p><p>If we look at our 12-note Pythagorean tuning with a chain of fifths<br/>from Eb to G# -- we can call this an &quot;Eb-G#&quot; tuning for short -- we<br/>find that there are in fact only two such intervals sizes, formed by<br/>two varieties of semitones known as &quot;diatonic&quot; and &quot;chromatic,&quot; and<br/>here marked as &quot;D&quot; and &quot;C,&quot; whose distinct sizes we&apos;re about to<br/>consider:</p><p>       C    D   D    C   D   C    D   C    D   D    C   D<br/>     C - C# - D - Eb - E - F - F# - G - G# - A - Bb - B - C</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, as it happens, the diatonic semitones are<br/>_smaller_ than the chromatic semitones. To see why they differ in<br/>size, we might look again at our chain of pure fifths for this tuning:</p><p>                            C = 7 fifths up<br/>                        |---------------------|<br/>                Eb  Bb  F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F#  C#  G#<br/>                        |--------------|<br/>                          D = 5 fifths down</p><p>A diatonic semitone such as E-F is formed from a chain of _five_<br/>fifths; if we start at the lower note of this interval E, we must move<br/>five fifths _down_ the chain to reach the upper note F. Note that this<br/>relationship also holds for B-C, D-Eb, A-Bb, F#-G, C#-D, F#-G, and<br/>G#-A. It is semitones of this kind which are the usual melodic<br/>semitones of medieval European music, for example in our sample<br/>14th-century cadences above involving accidental steps (G#-A and C#-D,<br/>or Eb-D).</p><p>Chromatic semitones such as F-F#, however, are formed from chains of<br/>seven fifths _up_. Other chromatic semitones are Bb-B, Eb-E, C-C#, and<br/>G-G#, each illustrating this same relationship on the chain. The use<br/>of these intervals as direct melodic steps is rather unusual in this<br/>era, but Marchettus of Padua and some other Italian composers of the<br/>14th century do it boldly and beautifully.</p><p>How large is each of these semitones? One way to compare their size<br/>uses the modern yardstick of _cents_, with a pure octave divided into<br/>1200 equal parts or cents. Keeping the math simple, we can take the<br/>size for a pure fifth (a ratio of 3:2) as a rounded 702 cents, and of<br/>a pure fourth (at 4:3) as a rounded 498 cents. These two intervals add<br/>up to a pure 2:1 octave, and their sizes add up to 1200 cents.</p><p>A diatonic semitone such as E-F is five fifths down; another way of<br/>looking at this is to say that it&apos;s five fourths up, starting again at<br/>the lower note E and moving to the upper note F:</p><p>                    498    498    498    498    498<br/>                 E3  -  A3  -  D4  -  G4  -  C5  -  F5</p><p>Adding up these five fourths, we get an interval of (498 x 5) cents,<br/>or 2490 cents. Actually, in moving up five fourths, we&apos;ve moved up a<br/>semitone plus two extra octaves (E3-F5), as the octave numbers for the<br/>notes in our chain show. However, by now moving down two octaves or<br/>2400 cents from F5, we arrive at the upper note of our desired<br/>diatonic semitone E3-F3. This interval has a size of (2490 - 2400)<br/>cents, or 90 cents.</p><p>For a chromatic semitone, let&apos;s say F-F#, we similarly move up by<br/>seven fifths of 702 cents each, and then down by four octaves:</p><p>             702    702    702    702    702    702    702<br/>          F3  -  C4  -  G4  -  D5  -  A5  -  E6  -  B6  -  F#7</p><p>Our seven fifths up (F3-F#7) give us an interval of (702 x 7) cents,<br/>or 4914 cents; moving back down four octaves to the upper note of our<br/>desired chromatic semitone F3-F#3, we have a size of (4914 - 4800) or<br/>114 cents.</p><p>Thus our 12-note Pythagorean keyboard gives us an MOS with two and<br/>only two sizes of adjacent intervals: diatonic semitones at a rounded<br/>90 cents, and chromatic semitones at a rounded 114 cents. A diatonic<br/>plus a chromatic semitone forms a regular whole-tone (e.g. E-F# from<br/>E-F plus F-F#) at around 204 cents:</p><p>       C    D   D    C   D   C    D   C    D   D    C   D<br/>     C - C# - D - Eb - E - F - F# - G - G# - A - Bb - B - C<br/>      114  90   90  114  90 114  90  114  90   90  114  90</p><p>There is an elegant poise and balance here which makes 12 an<br/>attractive number not only in a 14th-century Pythagorean tuning, but<br/>in various other historical European tuning systems fitting various<br/>eras and styles.</p><p>However, one person&apos;s ideal &quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; can be another<br/>person&apos;s overworn rut.</p><p>By the earlier 15th century, only decades after the Halberstadt<br/>12-note design had won out, European theorists were proposing tunings<br/>and keyboards based on the next Pythagorean MOS: 17 notes (also found<br/>in medieval Arabic and Persian systems). Other such larger MOS systems<br/>feature 29, 41, or 53 notes -- Chinese theorists, interestingly, being<br/>aware of a special property of 53.</p><p>Other approaches to tuning can produce different MOS sizes: in early<br/>modern Europe of the 16th and 17th centuries, for example, the<br/>prevailing meantone temperaments for keyboards offered such sizes at<br/>12, 19, or 31 notes, and instruments of all three sizes were designed<br/>and built, and music written taking advantage of the larger systems.</p><p>(It&apos;s worth noting, as the earlier medieval instruments with from 8 to<br/>11 notes show, that there&apos;s no law requiring that a keyboard size must<br/>match some MOS: for example, instruments of 13-16 notes were quite<br/>common in 15th-17th century Europe.)</p><p>In sum, for 14th-century European musicians and organ-builders, 12<br/>notes was an attractive point of repose; and its symmetrical<br/>qualities, as well as familiar keyboard ergonomics, still have their<br/>appeal.</p><p>However, as musicians have recognized at various times and places in<br/>the six centuries and a bit more since, 12 is not the _only_ place to<br/>stop, and there are enticing if not so widely recognized reasons to<br/>explore larger tunings and instruments.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=19890 href="#19890">ðŸ”—</a>David J.
