But I don&apos;t feel it&apos;s enough to add it to the article without more information from Olshevsky himself and a reference to where one can find out more about the name, what it means (why is it called a uniform dodecatetron), and who uses the name.</p><p>It&apos;s obviously uniform. But why &quot;dodecatetron&quot;? What does the dodeca part refer to and what is a &quot;tetron&quot;? Is it in a family with other shapes with simliar names, if so where can one go to look up and read about them if anyone reading the article wants to find out more about the subject?</p><p>With the birectification, I&apos;m not relying on the note from &quot;Tamfang&quot;. He just gave the hint I needed to see that it is the 2D face dual of the 5-simplex. That&apos;s then obvious from the way it is constructed. In the 6-dimensional hypercube, scale everything by a factor of 1/3 about the origin, and the vertices of the eikosany move to the centres of the faces of the 5-simplex. For instance, 11100 moves to the mid point of the equilateral triangle with coords 10000, 010000, 00100.  Simlarly for all the vertices of the eikosany.</p><p>So that means that the eikosany just _is_ the 2D face dual of the 5-simplex. It&apos;s a matter then of what you call that. Birectified is what it is called in the Wikipedia article on rectification, so, with no other name available to use, that&apos;s what I called it. I can&apos;t find that much on birectification on the web, but then it is a fairly rare thing to want to do, and I can&apos;t find an alternative name for it either.</p><p>Do you want me to add the note for you?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=75112 href="#75112">ðŸ”—</a>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2008 2:26:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>I thought the best thing was to e-mail George Oshlevsky directly - found his web site and home page through his entry in Wikipedia.

But looking on wikipedia, &quot;teron&quot; seems to be used a fair bit (though no results for dodecateron anywhere).
