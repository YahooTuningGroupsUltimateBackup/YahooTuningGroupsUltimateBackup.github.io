Would you be willing to<br/>comment<br/>&gt; &gt; on this device for us?  I have never been able to understand exactly how<br/>&gt; &gt; these rope things work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A fine scholarly overview on quipu is found in Elizabeth Hill Boone<br/>&gt; and Walter D. Mignolo, eds., _Writing without Words: Alternative<br/>&gt; Literacies in Mesoamerica &amp; the Andes_ (Durham and London, 1994). On<br/>&gt; quipu, see esp. pp. 192-96 and 234-9. A more thorough examination is<br/>&gt; found in Marcia Ascher and Robert Ascher, _Mathematics of the Incas:<br/>&gt; Code of the Quipu_ (Dover Publications, 1997). Earlier studies of<br/>&gt; Marcia and Robert Ascher are also useful. I&apos;ve posted a greyscale<br/>&gt; photo of a quipu (I unfortunately don&apos;t have a colored one on file,<br/>&gt; and the color is critical) at <a href="http://www.safarmer.com/pico/quipu.html">http://www.safarmer.com/pico/quipu.html</a>.<br/>&gt; What we know about quipus is partly conjectural, since we are<br/>&gt; dependent on the descriptions of Spanish writers from the 16th<br/>&gt; century, who didn&apos;t fully understand what they were describing.<br/>&gt; The art of reading quipus was lost pretty quickly by the late 16th<br/>&gt; century, thanks to Spanish repression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It isn&apos;t totally clear whether we should classify quipus as mnemonic<br/>&gt; systems or writing systems. One of the first books to describe them,<br/>&gt; Acosta&apos;s _Historia natural y moral de las Indias_ (1590), claimed<br/>&gt; that everything that could be recorded in Western books could be<br/>&gt; described as well using the colors, knots, and spatial relations on<br/>&gt; the different strings that make up quipus (see the illustration via<br/>&gt; the link I&apos;ve provided above). Acosta wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   And in every bundle of these, so many greater and lesser knots,<br/>&gt;   and tied strings; some red, others green, others blue, others<br/>&gt;   white, in short, as many differences as we have with our<br/>&gt;   twenty-four letters, arranging them in different ways to draw<br/>&gt;   forth an infinity of words: so did they, with their knots and<br/>&gt;   colors, draw forth innumerable meanings of things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently there was a tactile element to them as well. Ascher<br/>&gt; and Ascher (1981) write:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ...the quipu maker&apos;s way of recording -- direct construction --<br/>&gt;   required tactile sensitivity to a much greater degree. In fact,<br/>&gt;   the overall aesthetic of the quipu is related to the tactile: the<br/>&gt;   manner of recording and the recording itself are decidedly<br/>&gt;   rhythmic; the first in the activity, the second in the effect. We<br/>&gt;   seldom realize the potential of our sense of touch, and we are<br/>&gt;   usually unaware of its association with rhythm.... In fact,<br/>&gt;   tactile sensitivity begins in the rhythmic pulsating environment<br/>&gt;   of the unborn child far in advance of the development of other senses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And some of this is strikingly reminiscent of Frits Staal&apos;s<br/>&gt; discussion of rhythmicity in Vedic mnemonics in _Nambudiri Veda<br/>&gt; Recitation_ (1961), esp. when he compares Nambudiri Veda recitation<br/>&gt; with Aiyar Veda recitation (pp. 37-39). The difference here, of<br/>&gt; course, is that in recitations using quipu, the &apos;rhythmicity&apos;<br/>&gt; was tactile and not oral. (Or was it both? See my final comments<br/>&gt; below.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is interesting to note that the early Spaniards who encountered<br/>&gt; quipus didn&apos;t understand that they were mnemonic devices. This saved<br/>&gt; quipus from the inquisitional fires until near the end of the<br/>&gt; sixteenth century. (Maya codices weren&apos;t so lucky, unfortunately: only<br/>&gt; four remain.) Part of the reason they didn&apos;t recognize them as<br/>&gt; memory devices worthy of destruction (since the best tool of<br/>&gt; the conqueror is to destroy social memory) was linked to the fact that<br/>&gt; the memory devices of the Inca were so *unlike* ordinary writing<br/>&gt; systems or the Spaniards&apos; own &apos;memory palaces&apos; and &apos;memory theaters,&apos;<br/>&gt; which were used extensively in the New World.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With a little simplification, one could argue that there were at least<br/>&gt; *three* basic types of mnemonic devices used in premodern times: the<br/>&gt; orally interwoven devices associated with Vedic traditions; the visual<br/>&gt; &apos;memory palaces&apos; and the like developed in the West from Greco-Roman<br/>&gt; times on; and the tactile types used by the Incas (with similar<br/>&gt; variants used elsewhere). That covers three of the five senses.<br/>&gt; Someone could probably come up with a good argument that smells (e.g.,<br/>&gt; in incense) and taste (in holy meals) served mnemonic functions as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My Sinologist friends uniformly deny that any mnemonic devices were<br/>&gt; used in historical times by the Chinese, although there was a lot of<br/>&gt; rote memorization of texts. Since the Chinese classics are relatively<br/>&gt; short, and since there was no ban on them being written (indeed,<br/>&gt; canonical sources were often &apos;fixed&apos; in late antiquity in chiseled<br/>&gt; stone) the same *need* for formal mnemonics didn&apos;t exist that<br/>&gt; existed in India. Matteo Ricci&apos;s attempts to introduce &apos;memory<br/>&gt; palaces&apos; into China at the end of the 16th century were, by his own<br/>&gt; admission, rather a failure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should point out finally that quipu was &apos;read&apos; by a group of<br/>&gt; specialists, the quipucamayocs, who served in a sense as &apos;scribes.&apos;<br/>&gt; The knowledge represented by the distributed knots, colors, textures,<br/>&gt; etc., of each of the strings on the quipu could be quite extensive.<br/>&gt; There is, for example, a long Spanish text describing the history of<br/>&gt; the Incas, the _Relaci&iuml;&iquest;&half;n de la Descendencia, Gobierno y Conquista de<br/>&gt; Los Incas_, that is derived from the testimony in 1542 of seven<br/>&gt; quipucamayocs, whose words were recorded by Spanish scribes. How<br/>&gt; reproducible in *words* different recitations of a quipucamayoc<br/>&gt; were is unknown, so far as I know. It would be interesting to know if<br/>&gt; there was any link between the tactile &apos;rhythmicity&apos; that Ascher and<br/>&gt; Ascher note on the strings of quipus and &apos;rhythmicity&apos; in the<br/>&gt; recitations of the quipucamayocs. I don&apos;t know the answer, but I<br/>&gt; certainly wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there were. If such a link existed,<br/>&gt; it would suggest that parallels with Vedic mnemonics might not be<br/>&gt; empty ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steve Farmer<br/>&gt;</p></div>
