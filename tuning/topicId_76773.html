I have seen the interval 15/14 referred to as a &quot;major<br/>diatonic semitone&quot; and 16/15 as a &quot;minor diatonic semitone&quot;.  My<br/>contention is that this is incorrect.  In the traditional (Plato&apos;s<br/>diatonic syntonon) 5-limit JI tuning there exists only the 16/15<br/>semitone.  The 15/14 interval would be obtained by introducing the<br/>7-limit and in that case would be a chromatic, not diatonic, semitone.<br/>For example, 7/4 (Bb) x 15/14 = 15/8 (B).  One could substitute 15/14<br/>for 16/15 in the Plato tuning but that would throw off the 3rds and<br/>5ths from their just values.  Thanks for any clarification you can<br/>provide.  Sincerely,</p></div><h3><a id=76774 href="#76774">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2008 5:13:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>ham_45242 wrote:</p><p>&gt; The 15/14 interval would be obtained by introducing the<br/>&gt; 7-limit and in that case would be a chromatic, not diatonic, semitone.<br/>&gt; For example, 7/4 (Bb) x 15/14 = 15/8 (B).</p><p>You can&apos;t explicitely say that one is right and the other is wrong because it depends completely on which temperament are you working with.

If you wish all the 5-limit intervals sounded just, then, of course, it&apos;s undesirable to use a 7-limit one as a replacement for one of these. If you don&apos;t mind a slight detuning, then you can use 7-limit intervals in place of 5-limit ones. For example, if you have downloaded Manuel&apos;s scale archive, one of the files you find there is called &quot;parizek_7lqmtd2.scl&quot;. It&apos;s a scale I made in 2004 right in order it were easily tunable just by ear. The 1/1 is meant to be D there, which means that Bb-D-F-G# is tuned to 4:5:6:7.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=76776 href="#76776">ðŸ”—</a>ham_45242 &#x3C;arl_123@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2008 1:46:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ham_45242 wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The 15/14 interval would be obtained by introducing the<br/>&gt; &gt; 7-limit and in that case would be a chromatic, not diatonic,<br/>semitone.<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, 7/4 (Bb) x 15/14 = 15/8 (B).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can&apos;t explicitely say that one is right and the other is wrong<br/>because it depends completely on which temperament are you working<br/>with.

Intervals of<br/>the type (n+1)/n where n is an integer are generally associated with<br/>some form of JI.  A diatonic interval has to be associated with a<br/>diatonic, not chromatic scale.

Major and minor<br/>diatonic (whole) tones (e.g. 9/8 &amp; 10/9 in 5-limit) do occur, however.<br/> Sincerely,</p></div><h3><a id=76777 href="#76777">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2008 2:37:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>ham_45242 wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks for replying but that just adds to my confusion.</p><p>Okay, let&apos;s see if we can sort it out.</p><p>&gt; Intervals of<br/>&gt; the type (n+1)/n where n is an integer are generally associated with<br/>&gt; some form of JI.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; A diatonic interval has to be associated with a<br/>&gt; diatonic, not chromatic scale.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; Also, JI in the usual sense refers to<br/>&gt; scales constructed at least in part from JI perfect fifths and JI<br/>&gt; major thirds.

As I&apos;ve already said, this is true only if you treat the 7/4 as a minor seventh, which is the case of the &quot;dominant temperament&quot;. But again, there&apos;s no particular reason why the 7/4 should always work as a minor seventh. And as I&apos;ve also said earlier, there are tunings in which the 7/4 approximation IS used in the function of something else. The reason why dominant temperament works the way it does is that the syntonic comma (which is the distance between 10/9 and 9/8) and the septimal comma (which is the distance between 9/8 and 8/7) turn in to unison (or &quot;vanish&quot;) because all the three intervals (10/9, 9/8, 8/7) are approximated by only one size of major second. However, let&apos;s tak&eacute; the example of 7-limit meantone where 7/4 works as an augmented sixth, not as a minor seventh. In this tuning, both the syntonic comma (the distance between 10/9 and 9/8) and the septimal kleisma (the distance between 16/15 and 15/14) turn into unison because there&apos;s only one major second and only one minor second in meantone tunings, not two. This means that the 4:5:6:7 is approximated here by C-E-G-A#.

For example,<br/>in 31tet or 19tet (to the extent that 19tet can even do this stuff), a<br/>7/4 interval is actually referred to as an &quot;augmented 6th&quot; rather than<br/>as a dominant 7th. So a 4:5:6:7 chord would be spelled out as<br/>C-E-G-A#. This is the difference back in the day between the<br/>&quot;augmented 6th&quot; chords that you usually see in classical theory<br/>exercises and normal dominant 7th chords. Note that this pattern of<br/>spelling out chords actually applies to all meantone systems.</p><p>And then for schismatic systems, the 7/4 is spelled out completely<br/>differently, as is 5/4. For example, a C major chord in a schismatic<br/>temperament is spelled out C-Fb-G. They usually fix this by making Fb<br/>enharmonically equivalent to something like E\ or E-, so it doesn&apos;t<br/>look so dumb and counterintuitive.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make sense to label 15/14 as a chromatic<br/>semitone because if you&apos;re putting together some kind of 4-note chord,<br/>and you have C-E-G, you might view your options as C-E-G-Bb (where Bb<br/>represents a 7/4) or as C-E-G-B (where B represents 15/8). You might<br/>be thinking in terms of different 7ths to take, and so view the<br/>distinction between them would be a chromatic semitone. But always<br/>remember you could just as easily view that 7th harmonic as an<br/>augmented sixth, so that it becomes the difference between C-E-G-A<br/>(where A is 5/3) and C-E-G-A# (where A# is 7/4). Just because it&apos;s the<br/>&quot;7th&quot; harmonic doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it has to fit in the &quot;7th&quot;<br/>scale degree. You could well have a diatonic scale like C D E F G A# B<br/>C, and so the difference between A# and B would be some kind of a<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; semitone.</p><p>What I think this all is REALLY getting at is how exactly do 7-limit<br/>intervals fit into the current diatonic system? Furthermore, what the<br/>hell IS the current diatonic system, really? It would be nice if we<br/>could all finally agree on some &quot;standard&quot; to go by so that confusions<br/>like this just cease to be. Then we can &quot;expand&quot; whatever system we<br/>come up with to include 7 and 11 and 93 limit intervals.</p><p>For example, D-E-F#-G-A-Bb-C-D has some kind of diatonic &quot;flavor&quot; to<br/>it, although in this case it&apos;s a mode of the melodic minor scale. But<br/>D-E-F#-G-A#-B-C-D does NOT. Is it because there are two adjacent<br/>diatonic semitones, perhaps, which is a rule theory teachers often<br/>spit out for no apparent reason? Why the hell would that matter? These<br/>are the questions we need to ask.</p><p>On Thu, May 29, 2008 at 4:46 PM, ham_45242 &lt;arl_123@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ham_45242 wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; The 15/14 interval would be obtained by introducing the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 7-limit and in that case would be a chromatic, not diatonic,<br/>&gt; semitone.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; For example, 7/4 (Bb) x 15/14 = 15/8 (B).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You can&apos;t explicitely say that one is right and the other is wrong<br/>&gt; because it depends completely on which temperament are you working<br/>&gt; with. The way you view it is just one of more possible ways and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; the same as the one of Huygens or Tartini or Fokker. It uses what we<br/>&gt; now call &quot;dominant temperament&quot; which maps the 4:5:6:7 to C-E-G-Bb.<br/>&gt; But if you use, for example, the 7-limit schismatic temperament, then<br/>&gt; the mapping is completely different and the 4:5:6:7 is then written as<br/>&gt; C-Fb-G-Cbb. Another way, which is the one I prefer, is to use standard<br/>&gt; 7-limit meantone temperament which maps the 4:5:6:7 to C-E-G-A#, not<br/>&gt; Bb. Another possibility, with which perhaps someone like Ozan might<br/>&gt; have more experience than I do, is superpyth temperament which spells<br/>&gt; the 4:5:6:7 as C-D#-G-Bb. One more suggestion could be a 7-limit<br/>&gt; version of mavila (which I think people like Herman or Kraig could say<br/>&gt; more about) that does the 4:5:6:7 as C-Eb-G-B.

I don&apos;t think so. It just<br/>&gt; depends on whether you want to temper any intervals or not. If you<br/>&gt; wish all the 5-limit intervals sounded just, then, of course, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; undesirable to use a 7-limit one as a replacement for one of these. If<br/>&gt; you don&apos;t mind a slight detuning, then you can use 7-limit intervals<br/>&gt; in place of 5-limit ones. For example, if you have downloaded Manuel&apos;s<br/>&gt; scale archive, one of the files you find there is called<br/>&gt; &quot;parizek_7lqmtd2.scl&quot;. It&apos;s a scale I made in 2004 right in order it<br/>&gt; were easily tunable just by ear. The 1/1 is meant to be D there, which<br/>&gt; means that Bb-D-F-G# is tuned to 4:5:6:7.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for replying but that just adds to my confusion. Intervals of<br/>&gt; the type (n+1)/n where n is an integer are generally associated with<br/>&gt; some form of JI. A diatonic interval has to be associated with a<br/>&gt; diatonic, not chromatic scale. Also, JI in the usual sense refers to<br/>&gt; scales constructed at least in part from JI perfect fifths and JI<br/>&gt; major thirds. The issue here is that in traditional JI tunings of the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale you obtain only one type of semitone (e.g. 16/15 in the<br/>&gt; 5-limit or 28/27 in the 7-limit) The concept of major and minor<br/>&gt; diatonic semitones doesn&apos;t seem to make sense. Major and minor<br/>&gt; diatonic (whole) tones (e.g. 9/8 &amp; 10/9 in 5-limit) do occur, however.<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=76790 href="#76790">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2008 1:22:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just as another thought, I think that some of the diatonic scales<br/>merely coalesced because they were simply just major triads built a<br/>fifth up and a fifth down from the root. What the &quot;modes&quot; truly are I<br/>have no idea, although I know that in 12tet at least there are comma<br/>jumps all over the place for the same parent key and scale but a<br/>different mode. For example, D Dorian&apos;s 6th scale degree, a B, is<br/>often played as 27/16, for instance, or as a stack of 3 fifths, while<br/>the same B in C Ionian is usually comma adjusted down so that in<br/>relation to the D it&apos;s a 5/3 (15/8 from the C).</p><p>But what if we just applied the same principle to septimal chords? For<br/>example, let&apos;s say we&apos;ll make the I, IV, and V scale degrees all<br/>septimal supermajor third chords.

So the modes don&apos;t<br/>hold up the right way - the relative minor is NOT 3 subminor triads,<br/>as that D minor chord isn&apos;t a subminor.

For example,<br/>&gt; in 31tet or 19tet (to the extent that 19tet can even do this stuff), a<br/>&gt; 7/4 interval is actually referred to as an &quot;augmented 6th&quot; rather than<br/>&gt; as a dominant 7th. So a 4:5:6:7 chord would be spelled out as<br/>&gt; C-E-G-A#. This is the difference back in the day between the<br/>&gt; &quot;augmented 6th&quot; chords that you usually see in classical theory<br/>&gt; exercises and normal dominant 7th chords. Note that this pattern of<br/>&gt; spelling out chords actually applies to all meantone systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And then for schismatic systems, the 7/4 is spelled out completely<br/>&gt; differently, as is 5/4. For example, a C major chord in a schismatic<br/>&gt; temperament is spelled out C-Fb-G. They usually fix this by making Fb<br/>&gt; enharmonically equivalent to something like E\ or E-, so it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; look so dumb and counterintuitive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the other hand, it does make sense to label 15/14 as a chromatic<br/>&gt; semitone because if you&apos;re putting together some kind of 4-note chord,<br/>&gt; and you have C-E-G, you might view your options as C-E-G-Bb (where Bb<br/>&gt; represents a 7/4) or as C-E-G-B (where B represents 15/8). You might<br/>&gt; be thinking in terms of different 7ths to take, and so view the<br/>&gt; distinction between them would be a chromatic semitone. But always<br/>&gt; remember you could just as easily view that 7th harmonic as an<br/>&gt; augmented sixth, so that it becomes the difference between C-E-G-A<br/>&gt; (where A is 5/3) and C-E-G-A# (where A# is 7/4). Just because it&apos;s the<br/>&gt; &quot;7th&quot; harmonic doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it has to fit in the &quot;7th&quot;<br/>&gt; scale degree. You could well have a diatonic scale like C D E F G A# B<br/>&gt; C, and so the difference between A# and B would be some kind of a<br/>&gt; &quot;diatonic&quot; semitone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I think this all is REALLY getting at is how exactly do 7-limit<br/>&gt; intervals fit into the current diatonic system? Furthermore, what the<br/>&gt; hell IS the current diatonic system, really? It would be nice if we<br/>&gt; could all finally agree on some &quot;standard&quot; to go by so that confusions<br/>&gt; like this just cease to be. Then we can &quot;expand&quot; whatever system we<br/>&gt; come up with to include 7 and 11 and 93 limit intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, D-E-F#-G-A-Bb-C-D has some kind of diatonic &quot;flavor&quot; to<br/>&gt; it, although in this case it&apos;s a mode of the melodic minor scale. But<br/>&gt; D-E-F#-G-A#-B-C-D does NOT. Is it because there are two adjacent<br/>&gt; diatonic semitones, perhaps, which is a rule theory teachers often<br/>&gt; spit out for no apparent reason? Why the hell would that matter?

The way you view it is just one of more possible ways and it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; the same as the one of Huygens or Tartini or Fokker. It uses what we<br/>&gt;&gt; now call &quot;dominant temperament&quot; which maps the 4:5:6:7 to C-E-G-Bb.<br/>&gt;&gt; But if you use, for example, the 7-limit schismatic temperament, then<br/>&gt;&gt; the mapping is completely different and the 4:5:6:7 is then written as<br/>&gt;&gt; C-Fb-G-Cbb. Another way, which is the one I prefer, is to use standard<br/>&gt;&gt; 7-limit meantone temperament which maps the 4:5:6:7 to C-E-G-A#, not<br/>&gt;&gt; Bb. Another possibility, with which perhaps someone like Ozan might<br/>&gt;&gt; have more experience than I do, is superpyth temperament which spells<br/>&gt;&gt; the 4:5:6:7 as C-D#-G-Bb. One more suggestion could be a 7-limit<br/>&gt;&gt; version of mavila (which I think people like Herman or Kraig could say<br/>&gt;&gt; more about) that does the 4:5:6:7 as C-Eb-G-B.

I don&apos;t think so. It just<br/>&gt;&gt; depends on whether you want to temper any intervals or not. If you<br/>&gt;&gt; wish all the 5-limit intervals sounded just, then, of course, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; undesirable to use a 7-limit one as a replacement for one of these. If<br/>&gt;&gt; you don&apos;t mind a slight detuning, then you can use 7-limit intervals<br/>&gt;&gt; in place of 5-limit ones.

So, some cells may<br/>not only be relative frequencies, but also semitone factors of two<br/>consecutive notes of a new musical scale.<br/>The progression may contain two semitone factors that could replace<br/>the tempered T to establish ideal tone frequencies in any octave.<br/>This possibility would generate slight but important changes in<br/>harmony and tone intervals.  Let us give the names K and P to the<br/>unknown semitone factors that would rule the new octave.<br/>Both K and P should be progression cells, otherwise, their relative<br/>values with respect to C = 1 would give non-musical results.<br/>It is presumed that the values of both factors to be deduced, when<br/>they lie in the progression, would be placed near the tempered T,<br/>due to the slight imperfection of this scale.  Instead of the<br/>relation T12 = 2 of the tempered intonation, the equation Km Pn = 2<br/>is the one that complies with the octave quadrature, when and only<br/>when (m + n) = 12, provided m and n are integer and positive<br/>numbers.  Together, K and P should not be higher nor lower than T.<br/>If there is a solution, one of the factors, P, for instance, must be<br/>lower than T and K higher than the tempered factor to establish a<br/>new dodecatonic intonation.  No cell equals T, it is a non-musical<br/>number.</p><p>Therefore, the following equations can be stated:<br/>&#x9;(A) K m P n = 2<br/>&#x9;(B) m + n = 12<br/>The K and P sequence in the octave is a matter to be discussed<br/>should the equations be solved mathematically.<br/>Equations (A) and (B) were supposedly considered in former times.<br/>Hundred of years ago, Ramos de Pareja, Zarlino, W. Holder, Delezenne<br/>and other researchers probably studied this set of equations with<br/>four unknown quantities.  Obviously they were never worked out,<br/>since more mathematical information on musical elements was needed.<br/>Now, the required data work with the Natural Progression of Musical<br/>Cells.  These equations will be solved in the following pages.<br/>From cell No. 48 to No. 53, having values close to T, we see that<br/>Cells Nos. 48, 49 and 50 are lower than T, just as Cells Nos. 51, 52<br/>and 53 are greater than this parameter.  This group is indicated<br/>below.</p><p>CELL&#x9;COMMA&#x9;F(M,J,U)&#x9;DECIMAL VALUES<br/>48&#x9;M&#x9;M30 J16 U2&#x9;1. 0558784008<br/>49&#x9;J&#x9;M30 J17 U2&#x9;1.05707299111<br/>50&#x9;J&#x9;M30 J18 U2&#x9;1.05826893295<br/>51&#x9;M&#x9;M31 J18 U2&#x9;1.05946387773<br/>52&#x9;M&#x9;M32 J18 U2&#x9;1.06066017178<br/>53&#x9;M&#x9;M33 J18 U2&#x9;1.06185781663<br/>T = 21/12  = 1.05946309436</p><p>T is slightly lower than cell No. 51, therefore P may perhaps be<br/>Cell No. 50 or 49 or 48.  Similarly, K may be No. 51 or 52 or 53,<br/>which are slightly greater than T.<br/>If the mentioned equations were solved, then the importance and<br/>validity of cell progression as a link between science and music<br/>would be evident, provided K and P were progression cells.  The next<br/>step would be defining the sequence of K and P within the octave in<br/>order to detect the probable theoretical frequencies of the twelve<br/>notes and proceed to further discussion regarding harmony.<br/>Let &#x9;Pa    =  (48)&#x9;Ka  =  (51)<br/>&#x9;Pb    =  (49)&#x9;Kb  =  (52)<br/>&#x9;Pc    =  (50)&#x9;Kc  =  (53)</p><p>The next step is to work out equations (A) and (B) by using the<br/>combinations [(Ka)m(Pa)n], [(Ka)m(Pb)n], [(Ka)m(Pc)n], [(Kb)m(Pa)n],<br/>[(Kb)m(Pb)n], [(Kb)m(Pc)n], [(Kc)m(Pa)n], [(Kc)m(Pb)n], [(Kc)m(Pc)<br/>n], since probably one of them may solve the mentioned equations.<br/>The four unknown quantities K, P, m and n may be determined by<br/>applying logarithms.  The Neperian logarithm has been chosen, to<br/>work with a sufficient number of digits to reduce errors.  By taking<br/>logarithms on both sides of equation (A) we find:<br/>&#x9;m (ln K) + n (ln P) = ln 2<br/>Therefore, m = [ln 2 Â– n (ln P)] / ln K<br/>Replacing the above value of m in equation (B), we get:<br/>&#x9;ln 2 Â– n (ln P) = 12 (ln K) Â– n (ln  K)<br/>Solving for n:<br/>&#x9;(C)  n = (12 ln K Â– ln 2) / (ln K Â– ln P)           &#x9;ln 2<br/>= 0.69314718056</p><p>K and P values have to be replaced in equation (C) by cells Nos. 51,<br/>52, 53 and 48, 49, 50 termed Ka, Kb, Kc and Pa, Pb, Pc<br/>respectively.

When any of these results is an integer number, an<br/>important step in the analysis is accomplished.<br/>The following tabulation of ln Ki , ln Pi , and 12 ln Ki gives the<br/>values that should be replaced in equation (C).

Auxiliary equation (5)<br/>shows that Kb and Pb together with m = 8 and n = 4 solve equation<br/>(A).<br/>The semitones K and P of a new musical octave have been sought and<br/>worked out:<br/>K = Kb = (Cell No. 52) = (9/8)1/2 = 1.06066017178<br/>&#x9;P = Pb = (Cell No. 49) = (8/9) ( 21/4 ) = 1.0570729911<br/>&#x9;K8 P4 = [ (9/8)1/2 ]8 [ (8/9)( 21/4 ) ]4 = 2<br/>Contrasted with T = 21/12 = 1.05946309436, the K and P values show<br/>slight discrepancies.<br/>These remarkable results confirm that the Natural Progression of<br/>Musical Cells establishes the scientific base of the art of music.<br/>However, until it is proved that K and P resolve the harmony<br/>problem, they cannot be accepted as providing the desired solution.<br/>Their validity will depend on chord evaluations.<br/>Whereas Cells Nos. 52 and 49 could be the semitone factors of the<br/>best musical scale, the tone relative frequencies with respect to<br/>note C will depend on their sequence within the octave.  The<br/>sequences need to be analyzed, since tone frequencies and chords<br/>will depend on the K and P arrangements within the octave.<br/>IV. 2&#x9;THE K AND P SEQUENCE IN THE NEW OCTAVE<br/>The eight K and four P factors comply with proper distribution<br/>within the octave if the same factor sequence is maintained from<br/>note C to B.  When an arrangement of twelve semitone factors is<br/>attempted, the idea of four identical groups arises, since there are<br/>four P factors working within the octave.<br/>Elements of each group: K, K, P.<br/>Number of groups = 4<br/>Semitone arrangements: KKP, KPK and PKK.<br/>Following are the three types of Piagui octaves:<br/>&#x9;I)   KKP KKP KKP KKP = 2<br/>&#x9;II)  KPK KPK KPK KPK = 2<br/>&#x9;III) PKK PKK PKK PKK = 2<br/>&#x9;Four groups of semitone factors comprised by KKP, KPK and<br/>PKK rule the relations of tone frequencies in the new octaves of<br/>Piagui I, Piagui II and Piagui III scales respectively.  However,<br/>the new octaves work simultaneously.  In fact, the set<br/>KKPKKPKKPKKPKKP shows that Piagui II starts from the second K and<br/>Piagui III from the first P.<br/>TABLE X - FIRST SEQUENCE OR PIAGUI I<br/>NOTE&#x9;SF&#x9;CELL No.&#x9;RELATIVE&#x9;FREQUENCY<br/>&#x9;FREQUENCY&#x9;(Hz)<br/>C    &#x9;--&#x9;1 &#x9;1&#x9;&#x9;261.6255    *<br/>C#&#x9;K&#x9;52 &#x9;1.06066017178&#x9;= K&#x9;277.4958<br/>D       &#x9;K      &#x9;104 &#x9;1.125                  &#x9;= K2<br/>&#x9;294.3287    **<br/>Eb&#x9;P       &#x9;153 &#x9;1.189207115      &#x9;= K2P<br/>&#x9;311.127      *<br/>E        &#x9;K      &#x9;205 &#x9;1.26134462288   &#x9;= K3P&#x9;330</p><p>F       &#x9;K&#x9;257 &#x9;1.33785800438&#x9;= K4P&#x9;350.0178<br/>F#&#x9;P&#x9;306 &#x9;1.41421356237&#x9;= K4P2&#x9;369.9944    *<br/>G     &#x9;K&#x9;358 &#x9;1.5&#x9;= K5P2&#x9;392.4383    **<br/>Ab&#x9;K&#x9;410 &#x9;1.59099025767&#x9;= K6P2&#x9;416.2437<br/>A        &#x9;P&#x9;459 &#x9;1.68179283051&#x9;= K6P3<br/>&#x9;440             *<br/>Bb&#x9;K&#x9;511 &#x9;1.7838106725&#x9;= K7P3&#x9;466.6905<br/>B        &#x9;K&#x9;563 &#x9;1.89201693432&#x9;= K8P3&#x9;495<br/>2C&#x9;P&#x9;612 &#x9;2&#x9;= K8P4&#x9;523.2511    *</p><p>* Tempered and Piagui I frequencies<br/>** Pythagorean frequencies<br/>SF = Semitone Factor</p><p>Eight tones of any of the three new octaves differ from the tempered<br/>ones; the other four have identical values (C, Eb, F#, A).

It follows that if keynote is changed to C# whose<br/>frequency is 277.4958 Hz, the chromatic scale is made up by sequence<br/>KPK.  Likewise, when it is changed to D whose frequency is 294.3287<br/>Hz, the PKK sequence works in this new chromatic scale. Thus,<br/>chromatic scales of the three sequences work simultaneously.<br/>TABLE XI - SECOND SEQUENCE OR PIAGUI II<br/>NOTE&#x9;SF&#x9;CELL No.&#x9;RELATIVE&#x9;FREQUENCY<br/>&#x9;FREQUENCY&#x9;(Hz)<br/>C&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;1&#x9;= 1&#x9;261.6255  *<br/>C#&#x9;K&#x9;52 &#x9;1.06066017178&#x9;= K&#x9;277.4958<br/>D&#x9;P       &#x9;101 &#x9;1.12119522034   &#x9;= KP<br/>&#x9;293.3333<br/>Eb &#x9;K       &#x9;153 &#x9;1.189207115     &#x9;= K2P<br/>&#x9;311.127    *<br/>E&#x9;K       &#x9;205 &#x9;1.26134462288  &#x9;= K3P&#x9;330<br/>F&#x9;P&#x9;254 &#x9;1.333333...&#x9;= K3P2&#x9;348.834    **<br/>F#&#x9;K&#x9;306 &#x9;1.41421356237&#x9;= K4P2 &#x9;369.9944  *<br/>G&#x9;K&#x9;358 &#x9;1.5&#x9;= K5P2&#x9;392.4383  **<br/>Ab&#x9;P&#x9;407 &#x9;1.58560948667&#x9;= K5P3&#x9;414.836<br/>A&#x9;K&#x9;459 &#x9;1.68179283051&#x9;= K6P3&#x9;440           *<br/>Bb&#x9;K&#x9;511 &#x9;1.7838106725&#x9;= K7P3&#x9;466.6905<br/>B&#x9;P&#x9;560 &#x9;1.88561808316&#x9;= K7P4&#x9;493.3259<br/>2C&#x9;K&#x9;612 &#x9;2&#x9;= K8P4&#x9;523.2511  *</p><p>* Tempered and Piagui II frequencies<br/>** Pythagorean frequencies<br/>SF = Semitone Factor</p><p>The final Piagui sequence that could be applied in the manufacture<br/>of musical instruments would depend on the opinion of musicians and<br/>analysts, while, the three sequences will be considered in the<br/>analyses.

By<br/>plucking both lengths simultaneously or consecutively, the frequency<br/>ratio is evaluated by our brain that detects the perfect fifth.  The<br/>longer part 3/5 gives the basic frequency represented by the unit<br/>figure of Pythagoras note C while the shorter one 2/5 corresponds to<br/>note G.<br/>Similarly, when the string is seen as having seven equal lengths<br/>(7/7) and the slider is placed at 3/7 of its whole length, the<br/>frequency produced by this shorter length is [(4/7) / (3/7)] = (4/3)<br/>= 1.33333... times the frequency obtained from the longer one. In<br/>this case, the perfect fourth is detected by plucking both lengths<br/>simultaneously or consecutively.  The longer part 4/7 is now the<br/>basic length giving the unit figure of note C while the shorter one<br/>3/7 corresponds to note F.<br/>In this connection, it is interesting to note that Bartholomew, in<br/>his &quot;Acoustics of Music&quot;, when referring to perfect fifths and<br/>fourths, states that &quot;Nearly all primitive scales include these<br/>intervals as primary division points of the octave&quot;.<br/>The scientific basis of consonance and concordance and the needed<br/>rules of harmony are to be found in the tone frequency relationships<br/>of data given in Tables X, XI and XII.<br/>Perfect consonant intervals are set out in Table X:<br/>(G/C) = (Ab /C#) = (Bb /Eb) = (B/E) = K5P2 = (3/2) = 1.5 = Perfect<br/>fifth<br/>(F# / C#)=(G/D)=(A/E)=(Bb /F) = K3P2 =(4/3) =1.33333... = Perfect<br/>fourth<br/>Identical relations are obtained from Table XI of Piagui II:<br/>(G/C) = (A/D) = (Bb /Eb) = (2C/F) = K5P2 = (3/2) = 1.5 = Perfect<br/>fifth<br/>(F/C)=(F# / C#)=(Ab /Eb) = (A/E) = (B/F#) = (2C/G) = K3P2 =<br/>1.333333... = Perfect fourth.<br/>The same perfect intervals are found in Table XII of Piagui III.<br/>In the following diagrams, each tone contained in four Piagui<br/>octaves is marked by a point on a square perimeter.  All tones are<br/>linked by perfect fifths and perfect fourths in a cyclical way to<br/>continue on more octaves.  The origins of these characteristics are<br/>based on commas M, J and U that led to the Natural Progression of<br/>Musical Cells from which the K and P semitone factors were deduced.<br/>These are the basic features that will create the best chord<br/>expressions as will be discussed in Chapters VII and VIII.</p><p>        PERFECT FIFTHS AND FOURTHS IN PIAGUI SCALES</p><p>&#x9;Perfect fifth<br/>&#x9;Perfect fourth</p><p>Probably, man&apos;s common sense expected perfect links in the octaves<br/>over the centuries.  The precise and suitable values of K and P<br/>produce these remarkable results.<br/>The combined sounds produced by adding C + G or C + F, where G and F<br/>are the perfect fifth and perfect fourth respectively with respect<br/>to note C, are detected not only by our brain but also through<br/>computer-printing responses. Thus, the mentioned perfect intervals<br/>are the basic contributions, classifying the Piagui scales as the<br/>best way to perfecting harmony.  This technical procedure is applied<br/>on triad evaluations where three tone frequencies are added as<br/>discussed in Chapter VIII.</p><p>Chapter V<br/>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS RULED<br/>BY THE PIAGUI SCALE<br/>Since research began, the purpose was to determine a set of eleven<br/>relative frequencies with respect to C = 1 to generate the new<br/>octave and apply the new set to musical instruments instead of the<br/>tempered scale.  This object was achieved from the mathematical<br/>point of view.  However, chord evaluations will analyze and provide<br/>more information on this matter.<br/>V. 1&#x9;ELECTRONIC ORGAN<br/>The tempered tones of electronic organs are obtained by using a<br/>stable master oscillator to feed frequency dividers to get stable<br/>top octave frequencies, the lower ones being derived from successive<br/>divisions by two.  For example, the old integrated circuit ECG 2043<br/>contained the proper dividers according to the master oscillator<br/>frequency.  Together, they produced the top octave, whose tone<br/>frequencies have shown considerable discrepancies regarding<br/>theoretical tempered ones.<br/>The manufacturers&apos; criteria until almost the end of the last century<br/>were 100% hardware.  Electronic organ keyboards use software at the<br/>present time.  A few companies in the world use their own technology<br/>to supply the world market.  Considering that keyboard manufacturers<br/>do not frequently change their designs and software, the Piagui<br/>keyboard could be manufactured by using past technology.</p><p>Table XV shows the ideal fundamental frequencies of the new<br/>keyboards.  It does not consider the imperfection of man&apos;s ear,<br/>which demands a slight increase in the higher tone frequencies and a<br/>slight decrease in the lower ones.  From about key No. 16 up to No.<br/>68 ear efficiency is normal.  The upper and lower octaves are<br/>listened slightly out of tune, except for those organs that could be<br/>designed and manufactured with additional electronic means to<br/>compensate for human imperfection.<br/>Eight frequencies of any Piagui octave differ from the tempered<br/>ones.  Cello and double bass players will be familiar with the right<br/>emissions of the new tone frequencies as soon as the Piagui tones<br/>and harmonies are appreciated.</p><p>TABLE XV<br/>TONE FREQUENCIES  (Hz) OF THE PIAGUI KEYBOARDS<br/>No.&#x9;NOTE&#x9;PIAGUI I &#x9;PIAGUI II &#x9;PIAGUI III<br/>1&#x9;&frac14;

The desirable solution<br/>would be to achieve the figures given in Table XV.  However, since<br/>these frequencies demand an accurate frequency output by the master<br/>oscillator as well as exact divisors to provide a flawless top<br/>octave, it is impossible to attain such ideal keyboard frequencies.<br/>Quartz oscillators within &pm; 25 parts per million basic accuracy can<br/>be used to bring tone frequencies closer to the ideal, so the best<br/>set of figures will depend on the quartz oscillator frequency and<br/>the frequency dividers (divisors).<br/>The divisors, which are integers, impose some frequency errors,<br/>depending on the design of the top octave stage.<br/>Let us determine the tentative figures of maximum and minimum<br/>fluctuations permissible in Piagui I tone frequencies.<br/>As the least distinguishable consonance is M = 1.00112915, the<br/>frequency discrepancies must be sufficiently lower than M, in order<br/>to produce the expected tone frequencies.<br/>If any pitch is M times higher than ideal pitch, its error<br/>percentage is given by:<br/>[(1.00112915 Â– 1) 100] b&#x9;&#x8; + 0.113%<br/>Similarly, when it is M times lower, the error is Â– 0.113%<br/>Since an error of 0% is unattainable, a tentative maximum figure<br/>could be about &pm; (0.113 / 5) b&#x9;&#x8; &pm; 0.02%.<br/>The ideal frequency of note G in Piagui I intonation is 392.4383 Hz<br/>and 0.02% of this value is 0.08 Hz.  Therefore, the minimum<br/>permissible value would be (392.4383 Â– 0.08) = 392.3583 and its<br/>maximum permissible frequency would be (392.4383 + 0.08) = 392.5183<br/>Hz.<br/>The following diagram shows a tentative design of the Piagui I Top<br/>Octave.  The accuracy of the frequency output of the quartz<br/>oscillator is &pm; 25 parts per million.  That is to say maximum error<br/>of &pm; 0.0025%.<br/>Note that frequency ratios 3/2 and 4/3 corresponding to perfect<br/>fifths and perfect fourths respectively have been used in the Top<br/>Octave design.  Ratios (B/E) = (Bb /Eb) = (Ab /C#) = (3/2) are<br/>perfect fifths and    (2C/G) = (Bb /F), perfect fourths.<br/>The ratio (Perfect fifth / Perfect fourth) = (9/8) was also used.<br/>If musicians and analysts accept one of the Piagui intonations, the<br/>electronic industry could provide better technical criteria to set<br/>the top octaves.</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>ELECTRONIC ENGINEER<br/>(PIAGUISCALE)</p></div><h3><a id=76858 href="#76858">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2008 1:56:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A 7/6 could very well be a &quot;tone.&quot; What is a tone?

He&apos;s saying that for the major<br/>&gt;&gt; scale, you have ttsttts so that the &quot;t&quot;s represent something in the<br/>&gt;&gt; category of a &quot;tone,&quot; be it a major or minor tone, and the &quot;s&quot;&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; represent something in the category of a semitone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what he means and as he isn&apos;t generally clear<br/>&gt; about what kind of &quot;diatonic&quot; he&apos;s talking about I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; like to second guess him. But I least I agree that a 7:6<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t a tone if that&apos;s the point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So fine, if you want something like a tone when the diatonic<br/>&gt; semitone&apos;s 15:14 then you can use 28:25. This will still<br/>&gt; give minor thirds of 6:5. I don&apos;t know why you&apos;d want to do<br/>&gt; that but what you&apos;d get looks like a diatonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For a more obviously useful diatonic, with 9-limit chords,<br/>&gt; you can replace the 6:5 minor thirds with 7:6. This<br/>&gt; naturally leads to a &quot;tone&quot; of 8:7 because 7/6 * 8/7 = 4/3.<br/>&gt; But that implies a semitone of 28:27, not 15:14. So 28:27<br/>&gt; is the septimal semitone that&apos;s most likely to be used in a<br/>&gt; diatonic, and hence a &quot;diatonic semitone&quot;. Maybe that&apos;s his<br/>&gt; main point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And ham: Again, I don&apos;t see why the problem can&apos;t just be solved by<br/>&gt;&gt; calling 7/6 an &quot;augmented&quot; second, which it is. That&apos;s the point of<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;augmented&quot; and &quot;diminished&quot; intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would make 15:14 a minor second. But has Ham accepted<br/>&gt; the equivalence between &quot;minor second&quot; and &quot;diatonic semitone&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
