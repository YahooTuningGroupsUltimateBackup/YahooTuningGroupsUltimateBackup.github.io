I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;d like to share details of your set up, in<br/>particular your sound generator. I heard a lot of pulsing in Blurry Day (we talk of blurry cold<br/>days over here). Were these beats or FX or real time mixing or what?  I&apos;ve been make music for<br/>meditation and relaxation with a Doepfer A-100 analogue system which always comes out too bloopey<br/>and I think it freaks out the meditators though they are usually too polite to say so..... But I<br/>found these &quot;chord landscapes&quot; to be most relaxing.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2001 5:02:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison Monteith wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; David Beardsley wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have two new pieces up, Blurry Day and After the Full Moon<br/>&gt; &gt; at: <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 17 limit Just Intonation, kinda loopy...droney...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear David<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I enjoyed these pieces very much.

I didn&apos;t know that, but we&apos;ve had a few of those<br/>around here lately (NYC/NJ).</p><p>&gt; Were these beats or FX or real time mixing or what?</p><p>Ummm...it could have been the tuning, on one of the patches<br/>I found the LFO controling pitch (a no-no for me), so I&apos;d<br/>like to re-record these pieces in the near future. With the Korg<br/>I can only play 4 notes at a time so what you might be hearing is<br/>a melody drenched in many generations of echo.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;ve been make music for<br/>&gt; meditation and relaxation with a Doepfer A-100 analogue system<br/>&gt; which always comes out too bloopey and I think it freaks out the<br/>&gt; meditators though they are usually too polite to say so.....
