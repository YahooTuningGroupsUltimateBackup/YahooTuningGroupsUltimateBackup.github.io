What are the commas and<br/>accidentals that are really important to be able to notate simply?</p><p>Keep in mind that this doesn&apos;t assume anything about the underlying<br/>scale that we&apos;re using for nominals, so don&apos;t assume it&apos;s the 5-limit<br/>major scale or the Pythagorean major scale or anything like that. I&apos;m<br/>just trying to find the &quot;most important 5-limit chromas&quot; in general,<br/>as a starting point, which would hypothetically turn up regardless of<br/>what 5-limit scale you&apos;re playing, even if you&apos;re playing in a<br/>tempered scale or something.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104154 href="#104154">ðŸ”—</a>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2012 11:10:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m certainly not the most mathematically adventurous person on here, but with whatever 5-limit music I end up playing with, the overwhelmingly important comma is 25/24.
