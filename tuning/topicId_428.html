I had my PC packed away,<br/>but must remain here for a few more weeks, so<br/>I plugged it back in and, although I haven&apos;t given it<br/>a good look yet, it appears that the List has been<br/>salvaged. That&apos;s good news.  If anyone wants to<br/>contact me, I should be online until mid-Feb, then<br/>then offline while travelling back to San Diego.</p><p>- Monzo<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
