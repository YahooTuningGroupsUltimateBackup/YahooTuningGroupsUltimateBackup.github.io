It took McLaren versions for many to appreciate Darreg&apos;s work.<br/>&gt; For me there is still something in the original that stands on it&apos;s own and<br/>&gt; this is very true of Partch where the weaknesses just adds to the human<br/>&gt; quality of his music.<br/>&gt;<br/>     Some of you may wonder what Kraig is talking about here.<br/>     Ivor Darreg is one of the most important microtonal composers<br/>and instrument-builders in post-war America.  Starting in 1935,<br/>Ivor built his own electronic instruments and retuned them into<br/>various just intonation and equal tempered tunings. For 59 years,<br/>until his death in 1994, Ivor composed in and wrote about a wide<br/>variety of different equal tempered and just intonation systems,<br/>including 10 equal, 13 equal, 14 equal, 15 equal, 16 equal, 17 equal,<br/>18 equal, 19 equal, 22 equal, 24 equal, 31 equal and 53 equal.<br/>Ivor&apos;s &quot;Xenharmonic Bulletins&quot; were bound as part of John Chalmers&apos;<br/>journal &quot;Xenharmonikon,&quot; and Ivor produced 12 Xenharmonic Bulletins<br/>including a &quot;Special Bulletin&quot; which qualifies as &quot;Xenharmonic<br/>Bulletin Number Zero.&quot;<br/>    Ivor did not have access to modern digital retunable synthesizers<br/>until<br/>I loaned him one. In 1991 I dragged over a VFX synthesizer and an 8088 DOS<br/>laptop with a serial MIDI interface to Ivor Darreg&apos;s house.  The laptop<br/>recorded MIDI files of pieces which Ivor improvised in every equal<br/>temperament from 9 through 31.<br/>     Two subsequent sessions recorded MIDI files of Ivor&apos;s improvs<br/>in every equal temperament up to 53 equal.<br/>     At home, I recorded Ivor&apos;s MIDI pieces using the synthesizer<br/>Ivor had used to record his pieces. In the process I edited out<br/>a very small number of slight errors Ivor made while playing --<br/>accidential strikes of 2 keys at once, etc.<br/>      From these 3 MIDI recordings 3 audio CDs of Ivor&apos;s<br/>music were produced.<br/>      Ivor named these 3 CDs &quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier - Volume<br/>1,&quot; Volume 2, and Volume 3.<br/>      The music on these 3 CDs is typical of Ivor&apos;s microtonal<br/>compositional style and many people have called these CDs &quot;wonderful&quot;<br/>and &quot;impressive.&quot;  However, while the music on the CDs remains<br/>typical of Ivor, the timbres sound much cleaner and more digital<br/>than the earlier reel-to-reel recordings Ivor made of his music<br/>from 1957 until his death.<br/>     The synthesizers Ivor built by hand to explore various<br/>microtonal tunings used analog tubes and analog oscillators.<br/>As a result, Ivor&apos;s other recordings (aside from the 3 CDs<br/>&quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier&quot; Volumes 1, 2 and 3) have<br/>a characteristic crackly slightly noisy analog &quot;sound.&quot;<br/>     This is why Kraig Grady mentioned &quot;It took McLaren versions for<br/>many to appreciate Darreg&apos;s work.&quot;  The digital timbres used<br/>in the 3 CDs &quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier&quot; have the sleek<br/>noiseless somewhat metallic quality typical of all digital<br/>synthesizers, and some people appear to judge CDs solely by<br/>the amount of background hiss, rather than the quality of<br/>the music.<br/>      However, Kraig Grady is entirely correct when he points out<br/>that &quot;for me there is still something in the original that<br/>stands on its own.&quot;  In the case of Ivor&apos;s reel-to-reel recordings<br/>made using his hand-built amplified acoustic and analog electronic<br/>microtonal instruments, each note of Ivor&apos;s electronic instruments<br/>has its own slightly different timbre. Moreover, on instruments<br/>like his amplifying clavichord Ivor uses techniques which are<br/>impossible even on modern digital synthesizers -- for example,<br/>tremolo on a single note.<br/>    For those of you interested in Ivor Darreg&apos;s original recordings,<br/>I have also released a CD compiled from Ivor&apos;s original reel<br/>recordings. These recordings go back to 1957 and are of surprisingly<br/>high audio quality. These recordings show the classic analog<br/>&quot;sound&quot; of Ivor&apos;s microtonal music, with music Ivor recorded<br/>in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s.<br/>    For a taste of the newer digital &quot;sound&quot; of Ivor&apos;s microtonal<br/>music on digital synthesizers (dating from about 1988 to 1994),<br/>try Ivor&apos;s CDs &quot;Beyond the Xenharmonic Frontier&quot; Volumes 1, 2 and<br/>3.<br/>    All these CDs of Ivor Darreg&apos;s music are available from<br/>The Microtonal Record Shelf, which is currently running a<br/>&quot;buy 3, get 1 free&quot; promotion right now. Each CD is normally<br/>$15.00 but for members of this group I will give a discount to<br/>$12.00 each.  E-mail me for info on how to order these CDs by<br/>Ivor Darreg.<br/>    The Microtonal Record Shelf currently has 41 audio CDs of<br/>microtonal music in its catalog, along with 2 books and 3<br/>instructional audio CDs: the single CD &quot;Introduction to<br/>Microtonality,&quot; and the 2-CD set &quot;Consonance and Dissonance<br/>in  Microtonality.&quot;<br/>    E-mail me if you&apos;re interested in getting a catalog and a<br/>60-minute sampler CD containing audio excepts from all 41 of<br/>our microtonal CDs.<br/>    -- mclaren</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p></div><h3><a id=25219 href="#25219">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@austin.rr.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 12:44:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know, but when you include phrases in your posts<br/>&gt; like &quot;obvious to anybody with half a brain if they actually read the<br/>&gt; messages thoroughly&quot;, I have to take all of this with a grain of<br/>&gt; salt.
