For the moment, let me say it&apos;s a cheeky poem<br/>&gt;&gt; about a romance gone wrong and heart-tearing libidinous longing for<br/>&gt;&gt; someone even though the feeling is not reciprocated anymore. Just ask<br/>&gt;&gt; me for the translation.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This electrifying recording you hear has turned into a grandiose re-<br/>&gt;&gt; arrangment, or dare I say, &quot;soaring&quot;, over the preliminary<br/>&gt;&gt; lackadaisical version that featured arbitrarily/haphazardly hand-<br/>&gt;&gt; traced MIDI pitch-bends to emulate the intonation of the maqam:<br/>&gt;&gt; Offsets from 12-tET pitches by slides and slews of the PC mouse,<br/>&gt;&gt; undertaken during my neophyte years in studying Maqam music, before I<br/>&gt;&gt; even so much as knew the basics of tuning scholarship and<br/>&gt;&gt; professional<br/>&gt;&gt; audio production.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Having discarded the preliminary pitch-bend data grotesquely<br/>&gt;&gt; resembling Huzzam in the aforesaid novice version recorded years ago,<br/>&gt;&gt; I used this 12-tone &quot;Sonbirkez scale&quot; in my fresh entry for the<br/>&gt;&gt; Ethno2<br/>&gt;&gt; competition:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Sonbirkez Huzzam scale<br/>&gt;&gt; 12<br/>&gt;&gt; !<br/>&gt;&gt; 8/5<br/>&gt;&gt; 121/108<br/>&gt;&gt; 847/720<br/>&gt;&gt; 57/46<br/>&gt;&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt;&gt; 81/50<br/>&gt;&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt;&gt; 64/39<br/>&gt;&gt; 121/72<br/>&gt;&gt; 847/480<br/>&gt;&gt; 171/92<br/>&gt;&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There are three types of &quot;perde hisar&quot; (or &quot;perde huzzam&quot; if you<br/>&gt;&gt; will)<br/>&gt;&gt; at 8/5 (814 cents), 81/50 (835 cents) and 64/39 (857 cents), cleverly<br/>&gt;&gt; placed in the scale so as to complete the 12-tones to the octave<br/>&gt;&gt; picture... a picture that I find myself constantly returning to in my<br/>&gt;&gt; lethargic progress toward xentonality havens.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Note, that the notes C#, F# and Ab are assigned to aforesaid three<br/>&gt;&gt; inflexions of perde hisar. All I needed to do in my project was to<br/>&gt;&gt; move a pitch over to one of these notes for the correct, i.e. sassy,<br/>&gt;&gt; intonation required by the ecstatic and doleful H&uuml;zzam melody.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I took as reference Jacques&apos;s Egyptian Rast scale in the Ethno2<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; library when starting to formulate my scale. It appears I was left<br/>&gt;&gt; with only 121/72 and the octave in common at the end. Such is the<br/>&gt;&gt; incorrigibility of the Turkish H&uuml;zzam!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The length of the piece is 4:45 minutes. I realise that this a bit<br/>&gt;&gt; more than ordinarily expected. That is because of the &quot;naqarat&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; section, or reprises for the consequent strophes of the lyrics. If<br/>&gt;&gt; need be, I can prepare an alternative mix that fits the 3 minute<br/>&gt;&gt; constraint. But I truly wish the piece is preserved the way it is:<br/>&gt;&gt; Complete as it is.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The instruments used in the mix were, Maghrib Violin+Strings,<br/>&gt;&gt; Sustained<br/>&gt;&gt; +Tremolo Ouds, Tambourine, Oriental Tambourine, Bendir, Daire,<br/>&gt;&gt; Darbuka<br/>&gt;&gt; and my very own singing voice. Countless hours of digital mastering<br/>&gt;&gt; in<br/>&gt;&gt; my home studio unaccounted for!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My eyes searched for a Romanian clarinet in Ethno2, but I couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; find any. The only reed-wind I found suitable for the piece imitative<br/>&gt;&gt; of clarinet, the Bamboo Sax, was too limited in pitch register. Motu<br/>&gt;&gt; needs URGENTLY to incorporate Turkish sounds in its future Ethno<br/>&gt;&gt; bundle!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I tackled and finished the production of &quot;Son Bir Kez&quot; (&quot;One Last<br/>&gt;&gt; Time&quot;) in a period of utter exasperation with the Ethno2 mix of my<br/>&gt;&gt; Nishabureyn Peshrev and intense summer heat in Istanbul. The Peshrev<br/>&gt;&gt; uses too many pitches and Ethno2 is a resource-gulper when setting it<br/>&gt;&gt; up in such a way as to facilitate switching easily between same<br/>&gt;&gt; instruments tuned to different tunings. I hope Jacques and his team<br/>&gt;&gt; will understand and show leniency to me as I grapple to finish the<br/>&gt;&gt; Ethno2 rendition of the Peshrev and also a surprise piece, hopefully<br/>&gt;&gt; in time!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Ok, there it is...
