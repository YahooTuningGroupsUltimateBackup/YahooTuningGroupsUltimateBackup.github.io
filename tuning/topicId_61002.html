I&apos;ve been playing around with some different tunings that I haven&apos;t tried in a while, and somehow ended up with this interesting sequence in 18-ET (never one of my favorite tunings, but it seems to have some untapped potential here). I put an mp3 of it up on my weirdly-tuned music page:</p><p><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/18et-sketch.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/18et-sketch.mp3</a></p><p>It&apos;s only 29 seconds long, but there are some ideas here that I think might be worth developing into something longer... if I can figure out how 18-ET works in the first place....</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2005 9:44:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; After looking at and trying demos of some DXi plugins, I decided to get<br/>&gt; a copy of Absynth 3 because of its tuning support...</p><p>I&apos;d be curious as to just what caused you to choose that instrument<br/>over the others.

On the one hand, that encourages you to be more creative by avoiding the traditional chord progressions, but I haven&apos;t yet figured out what does work harmonically.</p><p>One of the nice things is that you can always fall back on the whole-tone scale, and you could also use the 9-ET subset as a pelog approximation.</p><p>I guess I&apos;m going to have to take a look at what I&apos;ve got so far and figure out how it works (harmonically and melodically) before I can do much else with it.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 8:17:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon Szanto wrote:<br/>&gt; Herman,<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;After looking at and trying demos of some DXi plugins, I decided to get &gt;&gt;a copy of Absynth 3 because of its tuning support...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;d be curious as to just what caused you to choose that instrument<br/>&gt; over the others.

The Midicode demo is fine as far as it goes, but it doesn&apos;t take input from Cakewalk, so it&apos;s pretty useless as a demo for evaluation. The tuning capabilities of the FM7 are more limited in comparison. What impressed me about Absynth is how easy it is to put a basic sound together, especially the envelope editing; the user interface is pretty well done.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 10:20:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman Miller wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s only 29 seconds long, but there are some ideas here that I think &gt; might be worth developing into something longer... if I can figure out &gt; how 18-ET works in the first place....</p><p>I wrote down the chord progression (well, typed into a text editor) to see if I could get some clues as to what&apos;s going on.

This seems to add to the sense of resolution. Additionally, the interval Db-E is one of the few moderately good consonances in this tuning: a nearly perfect 7/6, along with E-G which is a really sharp minor third, and then Db-G, a 600-cent tritone. The end of bar 4 is a similar chord but inverted, with the 7/6 on top. Here&apos;s the rest of the melody from that point:</p><p>flute melody (bars 4-6)<br/>[1/4] (rest) [1/2+1/16] Db4 [1/16] F4 [1/16 triplets] Bb4 Db5 F5<br/>[1/4].
