Unless you<br/>take some special action to re-set it to an OLD date (which isn&apos;t always<br/>easy on any operating system), the date is new.  When I download a file, it<br/>gets set on my disk to the date that I downloaded it.  Using file dates<br/>between systems isn&apos;t reliable at all, and you can&apos;t tell a thing by the<br/>date.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
