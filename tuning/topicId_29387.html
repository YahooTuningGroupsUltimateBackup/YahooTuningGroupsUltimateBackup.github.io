Unlike the Diamond, where each tone is part of only<br/>two &apos;consonant&apos; chords (notes that are in more are represented in<br/>more than one place on the diamond layout to compensate), in<br/>Blackjack there are more &apos;senses&apos; in which the notes can be taken.<br/>For Joseph Pehrson, we put multi-colored stickers on his keyboard to<br/>indicate these multiple relationships.

We&apos;re not even talking about the pitch-class C.<br/>We&apos;re talking about a single pitch, middle-C.</p><p>&gt; Don&apos;t get me wrong, though.  I understand the B point of view and<br/>I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; using the scale on a keyboard or notating it on a staff, so don&apos;t<br/>take the<br/>&gt; above as a vote for middle C.  I&apos;m just agreeing with the ease of C.<br/>On the<br/>&gt; surface, using B makes it look like you tried to hit C but missed.</p><p>OK. So maybe it&apos;s better to have middle-C _nowhere_near_ where it used<br/>to be. I think someone else already said that. It just gives a false<br/>sense of security, since _none_ of the other 60 or 87 keys on the<br/>keyboard are going to give a pitch _anything_ like what they used to.</p></div><h3><a id=30763 href="#30763">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2001 10:16:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; From: jpehrson@r...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems silly, but &quot;Middle C&quot; is the first note that a child<br/>&gt; learns<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the piano.

If you ignore the E&apos;s and B&apos;s, the white keys are<br/>&quot;naturals&quot; and the black keys to the right are the sharp versions. So a<br/>major third for instance could be played F - C# (2 - 5&gt;) or A - F# (4 -<br/>7&gt;).

Major sevenths on the keyboard are dissonant<br/>Blackjack intervals. Tritones are neutral thirds.</p><p>The dots are a nice addition, but they don&apos;t really sell the system.

Thanks,<br/>&gt; also, for including the C-base for me.... since I prefer that one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the .kbm files should work fine with Scala to create the<br/>&gt; appropriate scale.  However, I &quot;cheated&quot; and used a different<br/>method<br/>&gt; using, essentially, a &quot;C-base&quot; and subtracting and adding the cents<br/>&gt; of your posted values.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, no biggie.  The upside is that I have the correct pitches<br/>&gt; now, and the C-G-D-A mapping is correct for my system.  I *know* it<br/>&gt; is, since the central pitch B[ is now on my Halberstadt &quot;A&quot; where<br/>it<br/>&gt; should be in my system (your D-base system has it on Ab as I<br/>&gt; understand...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can hear it&apos;s correct, and the other smaller 33 cent values are<br/>&gt; where they should be...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, I may not mess with it much anymore on the &quot;if it&apos;s not<br/>broke...&quot;<br/>&gt; principle...  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t use Graham Breed&apos;s Midi Relay with my composing system at<br/>&gt; present.  I send converted Scala files (converted to MIDI)<br/>*directly*<br/>&gt; to my TX81Z synths...  This is all working correctly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HOWEVER, I&apos;m not getting Breed&apos;s Midi Relay to play the C-G-D-A<br/>Scala<br/>&gt; file correctly, which it should do right off.  I know it&apos;s not<br/>&gt; correct, since D natural sounds like D quarter-tone flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t really know where the problem is, there, but it really is<br/>&gt; immaterial as far as my composing goes, except for<br/>the &quot;exploratory&quot;<br/>&gt; work that I like to do sometimes in Midi Relay...  That&apos;s a mystery.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, now, what I really need is a color keyboard mapping<br/>&gt; pattern...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the rainbow-type thing like you did before in the Word file for<br/>&gt; the previous version of Blackjack.  Then, when I put the new<br/>stickers<br/>&gt; on my keyboard, I can use the secor color-coding like the one you<br/>&gt; used before.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would prefer, though, to use a mapping that keeps Middle C as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Middle C...  That&apos;s not too troublesome, is it??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No problem.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But if anyone else is interested, I&apos;d still like to persue the<br/>&gt; &gt; question of whether any particular keyboard mapping is going to<br/>&gt; make more future Blackjack keyboard players happier.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to effect the &quot;Blackjack standard&quot;<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that much,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s not going to affect the Blackjack key/notation standard at<br/>&gt; all.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and I really think keyboard players are going to like it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; better.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I seem to remember that some keyboard players who joined in the<br/>key<br/>&gt; &gt; standardisation effort did not share your middle-C fetish. Some<br/>&gt; might prefer to have the 1/1 pitch mapped to the middle-C key, or<br/>the<br/>&gt; 1/1 pitch mapped to a G key, since it _is_ a G. Or they might<br/>prefer<br/>&gt; A440<br/>&gt; &gt; to appear in its usual place. Or they might prefer to use the<br/>&gt; &gt; available keyboard symmetry to provide cues to the scale symmetry<br/>&gt; &gt; (which would incidentally result in a D having its regular pitch).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We can probably find C, G, D and A fetishists.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Saying that you want a particular note to have its usual pitch is<br/>&gt; &gt; nice, or at least it might be if everyone agreed on which note,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; this completely ignores the other 60 notes (or 84 or whatever).<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; it possible that there might be better or worse locations for<br/>them<br/>&gt; &gt; too?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I asked myself &quot;Apart from fetishes about particular notes, what<br/>&gt; &gt; features might a good keyboard mapping have?&quot; And I answered<br/>myself<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;How about having as many of the blackjack naturals as possible,<br/>&gt; &gt; ocurring on white keys?&quot; Does anyone else think that is of any<br/>&gt; &gt; significance at all?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And how about aligning keyboard symmetry with scale symmetry?<br/>Does<br/>&gt; &gt; anyone place any importance on that?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Otherwise, you&apos;re going to have to do a &quot;selling job&quot; on the B-<br/>as-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; middle C phenominon, since I&apos;m not getting the significance of<br/>it<br/>&gt; as yet...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not totally sure now that middle-C pitch on B below misddle-C<br/>&gt; key is the optimum. But certainly the aim was maximum naturals on<br/>&gt; white keys with middle-C not too far from middle-C. It just happens<br/>&gt; to align symmetries too.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you take that ASCII keyboard picture I gave, print it out, cut<br/>&gt; the note names away from the keyboard and slide them up and down,<br/>you<br/>&gt; can see for yourself. But I&apos;ll let you know when I have more info.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, it&apos;s absolutely clear what you&apos;re doing, and from the<br/>&gt; engineering standpoint it makes a lot of sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *HOWEVER* the problem is the &quot;indoctrination&quot; of the traditional<br/>&gt; keyboard player.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems silly, but &quot;Middle C&quot; is the first note that a child<br/>learns<br/>&gt; on the piano.  It&apos;s really a very basic note for a keyboardist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having it on the note *right next to it*, the B-natural is,<br/>&gt; essentially, a travesty!  It&apos;s almost humorous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s going to &quot;turn off&quot; a lot of players who might<br/>actually<br/>&gt; want to experience the system, but when they see something<br/>as &quot;kooky&quot;<br/>&gt; as that, they won&apos;t want to deal with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m willing to accept the fact that I could be wrong about this,<br/>and<br/>&gt; I would like to hear the opinions of other keyboard players but,<br/>for<br/>&gt; me, having middle C on the note B right next to it is<br/>&gt; almost &quot;perverse...&quot;  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although it might make the most sense from the design standpoint,<br/>in<br/>&gt; matters of music and art there is a certain &quot;lethargy...&quot;  Let&apos;s<br/>call<br/>&gt; it &quot;conservatism.&quot;  There are certain conventions that are<br/>historical<br/>&gt; and overturning conventions is probably easier in science and<br/>&gt; engineering than it is in art and music...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After all, there are *many* conservative players who would even<br/>&gt; resist *any* deviations from 12-tET as &quot;out of tune&quot; playing...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m certainly not trying to &quot;defend&quot; this ilk, but I&apos;m just<br/>&gt; reiterating the obvious fact that certain conventions pertain in<br/>&gt; music, and having &quot;middle C&quot; on the B right next to it is not one<br/>of<br/>&gt; them!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I prefer it on the &quot;usual&quot; note, as is clear, and would like to use<br/>&gt; the C-G-D-A Blackjack system that way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I would enjoy hearing from other keyboard players who<br/>would<br/>&gt; suggest that having &quot;middle C&quot; on the B right next to it is quite<br/>&gt; OK...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anybody???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JP</p><p>JP!</p><p>My opinion as a microtonal keyboardist (ha! how I flatter myself!) is<br/>that C should be based on 256Hz, A=27/16 &apos;above&apos; that, @ 432Hz<br/>reference.

What happens, though, when more<br/>than one instrumentalists are playing together?  What happens if one<br/>of them has an instrument that is at a &quot;set&quot; pitch, like Alison on<br/>our list has??</p><p>So, eventually *something* has to be standardized.

However, my observations are that even when<br/>people are involved in &apos;microtonal&apos; music, and proclaim to be wanting<br/>to work outside of the standard, accepted tuning regime, they are<br/>still far, far from radical, and will very likely take a path of<br/>least resistance. Most of what you ask to do would be too difficult<br/>to accept.</p><p>Just my $.02.</p><p>One caveat, and it&apos;s an important one, is the division of choice<br/>between working with others indirectly, and forming a performing<br/>group/collective. For instance, Joseph Pehrson is/will be composing<br/>music to be performed (and published) and it makes emminent sense for<br/>him to include &apos;biases&apos; that will make his music performable for<br/>others, possibly without direct input from him. Therefore, points of<br/>reference (middle C?), notation choices, etc, are important<br/>decisions, directly affecting quality and numbers of performances.</p><p>Yet another member, Alison Monteith, is constructing an ensemble of<br/>string and percussion instruments, all to a new tuning, to be used<br/>with instrumentalists and singers. Alison is working in a like<br/>tuning, but may make different choices and, since it is a self-<br/>contained ensemble, could easily choose to buck any convention at<br/>will without affecting the end result, since Alison will be<br/>devoloping the music/performers as a collective (I believe).<br/>Different scenario altogether.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., ambassadorbob@y... wrote:<br/>&gt; You, as the composer, expect yourself to transpose and read in<br/>&gt; different clefs, etc.  Right?

I forget which board it was, probably his Mini-moog, but it<br/>could be set up with the kbd inverted, so the scale went from high to<br/>low as you played from left to right. Apparently he came up with some<br/>unusual licks by turning himself (metaphorically) on his head. Not<br/>many people like to be that adventuresome...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (who asks, mildly, if maybe you could trim your replies in the<br/>future, to save bandwidth? :) )</p></div>
