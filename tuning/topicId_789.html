These<br/>common scales taken from the very series you mentioned  (0,2,4,5,7,9,11)<br/>seem to have the property that  the generator is always the same size<br/>subtended by the same number of steps even though some of the thirds are<br/>smaller than some of the seconds.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/1999 1:14:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message text written by <a href="mailto:INTERNET:tuning@onelist.com">INTERNET:tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt;John Myhill BTW was a very famous logician who was involved in<br/>computer music at SUNY-Buffalo in his later years.</p><p>John Clough&lt;</p><p>Myhill was one of the leaders in constructive mathematics (a successor to<br/>Brouwer&apos;s intuitionism) as well as a pioneer in algorithmic composition.<br/>The relationship between the two activities is of interest.</p></div><h3>John Clough &#x3C;clough@xxxx.xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/1999 4:55:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Right, Paul, MP implies DE, but DE does not imply MP.</p><p>John Clough</p><p>On Fri, 12 Feb 1999, Paul H.
