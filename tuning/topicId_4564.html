Roughness, tonalness, and difference tones are the three major<br/>pyschoacoustical phenomena responsible for the preference for small-integer<br/>ratios. The simple complexity formulae we&apos;ve been throwing around can only<br/>model one of these at a time. Sethares carefully models roughness, harmonic<br/>entropy models tonalness, and a model such as Grady&apos;s focuses on difference<br/>tones. Note that with sine waves or inharmonic timbres, roughness only<br/>applies to intervals less than a minor third and difference tones are very clear.</p><p>&gt;I was thinking about a &quot;fifth&quot; up and a &quot;fourth&quot; down as being the same.  It<br/>&gt;makes sense that in actual music, the intervals are heard differently.  I<br/>&gt;have also been wondering if I even consider &quot;fourths and fifths&quot; to be<br/>&gt;consonant or dissonant.  They are almost neither.</p><p>If a fifth is not consonant, what is?</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/1999 7:50:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Glen Peterson:]<br/>&gt;I have also been wondering if I even consider &quot;fourths and fifths&quot; to<br/>be consonant or dissonant.

Taking the spacing of the chord, you then add the<br/>harmonics without any octave reduction and the first order difference tones<br/>omitting any repeats of harmonics. It is a formula in progress and would<br/>appreciate your feed back as to Lullaby at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/tun.per.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/tun.per.html</a> . It is arrange from con. to dis.<br/>based on<br/>the this formula so we have something to try with our EARS and the more<br/>EARS the<br/>better!</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The simple complexity formulae we&apos;ve been throwing around can only model one<br/>&gt; &gt;of these at a time.

I<br/>wouldn&apos;t trust glass organs to be sinusoidal enough to demonstrate this --<br/>the finger will probably contribute enough second harmonic to destroy the<br/>effect completely.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In all, if your carillon is truly producing sine waves, I<br/>&gt;&gt; suspect you will<br/>&gt;&gt; find it rather unmusical, a poor demonstration of JI, and<br/>&gt;&gt; probably rather<br/>&gt;&gt; annoying to the ear.</p><p>&gt;Someone should slap you for this!  I would hope that the point of this list<br/>&gt;is to ENCOURAGE each other to experiment, theorize, and dream about tuning<br/>&gt;and microtonal instruments.  Your comment has the opposite effect on me.</p><p>I apologize. That was not my intent. I was basing this comment on my own<br/>experience with sine waves. I was hoping Darren Burgess would be encouraged<br/>to try other timbres. I did not mean to be discouraging.</p><p>&gt;On another note, you mentioned my otonal/utonal chords.  Here are the<br/>&gt;primary ones I was using:</p><p>&gt;Otonal:</p><p>&gt;9/5, 9/7, 9/8, 3/2<br/>&gt;16/9, 8/5, 4/3, 8/7<br/>&gt;7/4, 14/9, 7/5, 7/6<br/>&gt;12/7, 3/2, 1/1, 6/5<br/>&gt;5/3, 10/7, 5/4, 10/9</p><p>&gt;Utonal:</p><p>&gt;9/5, 8/5, 7/5, 6/5<br/>&gt;16/9, 14/9, 4/3, 10/9<br/>&gt;7/4, 3/2, 5/4, 9/8<br/>&gt;12/7, 10/7, 9/7, 8/7<br/>&gt;5/3, 2/1, 4/3, 7/6</p><p>You seem to have otonal and utonal switched! (I suspect you just made a typo<br/>this one time, though). Anyway, are all your pitches really between 1/1 and<br/>2/1? After you confirm this, I will try these chords myself on the synth and<br/>get back to you. Also, can you tell me what intervals, if any, you find<br/>dissonant on your glass organ?</p></div><h3>Paul H.
