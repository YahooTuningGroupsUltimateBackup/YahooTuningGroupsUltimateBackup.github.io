Neil?</p><p>But I don&apos;t understand your point here, Daniel.</p><p>&gt;&quot;you don&apos;t need to use infinitely high factors to get an infinite JI set of<br/>&gt;pitches&quot; (trivial but true)</p><p>What&apos;s the difference between this and Paul&apos;s actual statement?  You&apos;ve<br/>swapped &quot;harmonic series&quot; for &quot;factors&quot;?  Either way, it is true, as you<br/>point out.  Hardly &quot;nonsense&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;JI systems can use a small set of simple intervals locally, generating a<br/>&gt;potentially infinite set of pitches globally&quot; (which starts to suggest how<br/>&gt;this works in real musics).</p><p>Of course, you can make plenty of music from a single harmonic series.<br/>Making 1- or 2-D chains of simple generators is popular, but hardly the<br/>only path to &quot;real musics&quot;.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
