It one has only apples and someone offers you an orange yes, most<br/>of us will take it! But that doesn&apos;t mean we were not wishing we had one in the<br/>first place, or anything other than another darn apple. As you know , The<br/>ancient greeks modulated despite there musically system not being particularly<br/>modulation friendly. It has its musical use and satisfies a real musical<br/>desire.  Ptolemy titled some chapters &quot;How the modulations of attunement<br/>resemble those of souls in crises of life&quot; also &quot;That the modulations between<br/>tonoi correspond to the lateral movement of the stars&quot;. . The impulse to<br/>modulate changed the music, not the other way around.  What atonality did was<br/>end modulation (transposition being something different) or at least postpone<br/>it.The early  minimalist avoided it. Modulation had become a dirty word. It has<br/>become &quot;anti-spiritial&quot; or &quot;anti-healing&quot; as if changing keys would upset the<br/>balance of the &quot;Chakras&quot;. Frankly the changing of keys might &quot;resemble those of<br/>souls in crises of life&quot;, and maybe we can only heal these crises by the<br/>confrontation of the problem. Orpheus likewise would take one into the<br/>underworld and out safely. The transendentalist raising above and away (via<br/>some economic cushion) by the offering of musical escapes resembles to me just<br/>another form of suppression. I think this has regretably become the function of<br/>music at large. It is why people don&apos;t listen to &quot;harsh&quot; music when they can<br/>shelter and block out the world with pleasantness. I for one cannot think of<br/>another time where the crises facing us from within have not been so great.<br/>Also we live in an world where the the stars change quicker than before.<br/>Modulation is part of musicial magic!<br/>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I wanted unlimited transposition 31tet would indeed be tempting, but I go<br/>&gt; with Douglas Leedy on the subject of temperament and modulation.
