However this time I bring you initial information regarding another one which is part of the Piagui scale family since its octave tones are K and P functions.</p><p>Yesterday morning the new set was out of the scene to become an interesting subject a few hours later.</p><p>The twelve tone cents show three similar groups around six, two and four cents so the new Piagui chords will be clearly distinguished from most 12 EDO chords.</p><p>In a few days I will send you full information for a further analysis. The Piagui IV guitar, as it is named, will be constructed in the following weeks. Fractional frets will give it the expected right tonalities.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario</p></div>
