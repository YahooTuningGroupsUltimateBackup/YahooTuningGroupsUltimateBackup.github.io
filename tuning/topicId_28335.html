Yes, much of the<br/>material often seems overly mathematical . . . but I assure you it&apos;s<br/>all based on qualities I can hear when I use these tunings on my<br/>keyboard (or guitars). And not just me -- there is a long history of<br/>musicians working from very similar principles -- just read the<br/>volumes of the journals Xenharmonikon and Interval, for a start.</p><p>Earlier this year I started an additional list, tuning-<br/><a href="mailto:math@yahoogroups.com">math@yahoogroups.com</a>. I then conducted an anonymous poll as to<br/>whether that more mathematical list should stay separate, or whether<br/>more mathematical topics should be covered here on this list. The<br/>result was 11 votes for the first option, 23 votes for the second<br/>option (I did not vote). Nevertheless, I kept the other list, which<br/>is still quite active. But clearly there are at least 23 people here<br/>who are interested in such matters, and for their benefit I think<br/>it&apos;s worth making a few very concise and information-rich posts such<br/>as this one.</p><p>If anyone doesn&apos;t understand anything in my posts, I encourage them<br/>to ask questions . . . I am very patient and will be happy to explain<br/>all the concepts I&apos;m referring to! You are new to this list, so<br/>perhaps many of the concepts are unfamiliar to you, but many of us<br/>have been here for years so we have a bit of a language of our<br/>own . . . I should think that would be understandable.</p><p>Besides, this post was a _reply_ to a post by Gene. Why not just<br/>allow me to reply to him, and ignore this discussion if you so desire?</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
