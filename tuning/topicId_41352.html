Since one can observe tonotopies in corti organ and cortical regions they<br/>think, for instance, that the pitch height sensations, as psychic correlates of measurable frequencies,<br/>are the kind of mental atoms with which the musical or linguistic perceptions are built. It&apos;s that type<br/>of sensation I labeled regressive perception and I mentioned about that it&apos;s yet relational.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe you would see as a mental atom the pitch height sensation of the A440.</p><p>When you wrote &quot;the red sensation is playing a specific role in the larger sensation of the moment&quot;,<br/>apparently you could fall under my criticism, but it seems you denote by sensation, even with the<br/>red one, the type of qualities I called globally fused, very far from parametrizable ones. It&apos;s there an<br/>artistic notion compare with the other supposed scientific one.</p><p>So, the word sea used in poetry is very far from the scientific one and it&apos;s essentially its rich evocative<br/>contents that serves rather than the common designation.</p><p>I hope you understand that against those reducing perception to elementary sensation I oppose hardly<br/>and promote a relational viewpoint, but at same time I try to respect the artistic field where synergetic,<br/>synesthesic and fusional process occur towards high level of sensitivity.</p><p>A last word about space. We use with the same name two distinct concepts. Mine is not opposed to<br/>yours since not belonging to artistic field, but yes, in that restrictive sense, its completely relational.</p><p>I pretend that the operatory structure on interval spaces has a primordial importance in that kind of<br/>music (almost all) using intervals. The high stability of the time substrat gives exceptional operatory<br/>properties to time and frequency intervals while properties implying the energy factor may keep only<br/>a topological invariance, so improper to the same operativity. That is not without consequence in long<br/>term on cognitive aspects, musical sense investment and expressive strategies.</p><p>Using an analogy, the economy of woyels of the linguist Martinet and the color of woyels of the poet<br/>Rimbaud belong to distinct universes.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
