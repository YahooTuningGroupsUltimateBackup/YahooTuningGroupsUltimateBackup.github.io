Aristoxenos&apos;s approach was based<br/>primarily on the *concept* (but not the actual practice)<br/>of the geometric mean.  These terms are explained well<br/>in the Scala description which Dave quoted:</p><p>&gt;    /GEOMETRIC<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uses the geometric mean, i.e. sqrt(a * b). This divides an interval<br/>&gt; equally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    /HARMONIC<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uses the harmonic mean, i.e. 2 * a * b / (a + b). Densifying a scale<br/>&gt; by inserting harmonic or arithmetic means is also known as<br/>&gt; katapyknosis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    /ARITHMETIC<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uses the arithmetic mean, i.e. (a + b) / 2. Densifying a scale by<br/>&gt; inserting harmonic or arithmetic means is also known as katapyknosis.</p><p>&gt; &gt; (64/63)+(63/62)+(93/92)+(92/91)+(91/90)=16/15<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is that also katapyknosis? What is that called?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not sure, but it probably is katapyknosis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course all of the above should be multiplications, not additions,<br/>&gt; unless you put log() around every ratio.</p><p>Guys, you are missing an important point about _katapyknosis_.<br/>It referred originally to the division of the small interval<br/>at the bottom of a chromatic or enharmonic trichord, to form<br/>a &quot;proper&quot; tetrachordal structure.  This small interval,<br/>which is always &lt; (4/3)^(1/2) , is called the _pyknon_; its<br/>division into two equal or quasi-equal parts is _katapyknosis_.</p><p>See my &quot;Tutorial on Ancient Greek Tetrachord-theory&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/tutorial.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>Later, the term obviously referred to a more complicated<br/>tuning structure, because Aristoxenos rails out against<br/>the harmonists, theorists who used _katapyknosis_ to describe<br/>the entire system.  I take this to mean that the harmonists<br/>were comparing different modes by using different &quot;8ve&quot; spaces<br/>for all of them and retaining the *functional* values of<br/>the notes for each mode in their diagrams, thus necessitating<br/>_katapyknosis_ of various small intervals from one mode to<br/>another in order to obtain the proper small ratios in each<br/>shade of chromatic and enharmonic genos.</p><p>So AFAIK that example above doesn&apos;t qualify as _katapyknosis_.<br/>For one thing, I think it has way too many notes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Are there always<br/>&gt; &gt; superparticular ratios when you do katapyknosis?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think so.</p><p>Superparticular ratios were important in the work of many<br/>Greek theorists, but not all.  Aristoxenos did not describe<br/>his system in terms of ratios (of string-lengths) or any<br/>other kind of physically measurable quantity at all, but<br/>only in terms of string tension, and thus determined solely<br/>by ear.  For my initial assessment of Aristoxenos&apos;s work:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/aristoxenus/318tet.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you had to explain katapyknosis clearly to a<br/>&gt; &gt; bunch of high school kids, how might you do it?</p><p>I think what I wrote above helps a little.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=26236 href="#26236">ðŸ”—</a>kp712@yahoo.com</h3><span>7/16/2001 2:52:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I think what I wrote above helps a little.<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>Absolutely!

Yes, you can say you are adding intervals.<br/>Intervals are musical entities. Rational numbers are mathematical<br/>entities used for many other things besides describing musical<br/>intervals in terms of frequency (or wavelength) ratios.</p><p>Even for musical intervals, we sometimes use these numbers in the<br/>log-frequency domain to represent fractions of an octave (e.g. an<br/>equal tempered semitone as 1/12 oct).
