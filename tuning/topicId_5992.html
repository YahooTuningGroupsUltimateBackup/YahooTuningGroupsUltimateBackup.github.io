It&apos;s very interesting to note that at the time<br/>of this article (November 1, 1991), a mere nine years ago, Joe (though<br/>already 64 years young) had only a single local and independently<br/>produced record, _KAVALINKA_, to his name (and this article is in fact<br/>a biographically generous review of that record)... Since that time,<br/>Joe&apos;s recording career (the 1962, &quot;pioneering, but unreleased, record<br/>for Atlantic&quot; mentioned in the article was eventually released by John<br/>Zorn&apos;s Avant label as _PINOTS NINE_) and international reputation have<br/>blossomed, and today they stand on a much more even keel with his<br/>immense talent.</p><p>Dan</p><p>*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=+</p><p>A Free Man: Joe Maneri&apos;s music rides the currents of his heart</p><p>by Ed Hazell</p><p>On paper, Joe Maneri seems intimidating. He&apos;s one of those imposing<br/>multi-hyphenated polymaths --<br/>composer-instrumentalist-educator-author -- who can make you feel<br/>inadequate. In person, the outgoing New England Conservatory professor<br/>is more like a jovial, but weird, Burl Ives than a forbidding<br/>academic. Perhaps it&apos;s because the 64-year-old&apos;s circuitous road to<br/>academia has taken him from the streets of Brooklyn to the lecture<br/>halls of Austria and from the Quartones dance band in the Catskills to<br/>microtones at NEC.</p><p>His debut CD as an improviser, _Kavalinka_ (Cochlea/Northeastern), is<br/>an all-too-rare event in a remarkable and largely overlooked career.<br/>It&apos;s difficult music, alternately touched with an Old World sadness<br/>and an otherworldly joy. Entirely improvised by Maneri on clarinet and<br/>tenor, his son Matt on violin, and percussionist Masashi Harada, it<br/>sounds chaotic at first but is actually linked in subtle elliptical<br/>ways. Their spontaneous ordering of possibilities is the source of the<br/>music&apos;s power and excitement. Sometimes the players compliment one<br/>another, one finishing a thought another has started. Sometimes they<br/>contrast: undulating clarinet lines playing off against long, slow<br/>violin tones and spacious percussion touches.</p><p>The music is melodic, but not in any conventional sense. The melodies<br/>are sometimes built out of the smallest of intervals, tiny contours<br/>that make you listen for fine gradations of pitch. But then the music<br/>will exhaust itself, jumping in huge, wide leaps. The elder Maneri&apos;s<br/>clarinet is especially moving, tinged with the Italian and Greek<br/>sonorities he learned playing in dance bands. The younger Maneri is<br/>someone to watch, full of quite surprises and understated virtuosity.<br/>And Harada&apos;s percussion is loaded with unexpected silences and sudden<br/>onrushes of noise.</p><p>Maneri grew up in ethnically diverse Brooklyn, where he learned<br/>clarinet with a shoemaker who played drums in a neighborhood Italian<br/>dance band. By his late teens, he was working with the Quartones,<br/>touring New England and the Catskills.</p><p>But he was never one to play anything straight for long. &quot;I was always<br/>jumping hurdles into a different place. I was always sort of naturally<br/>avant-garde. I was starting to play wrong notes. My ear is good, but<br/>not for normal people,&quot; he says.</p><p>Maneri&apos;s lifelong rebelliousness lead him to some Greenwich Village<br/>hipsters in 1947. &quot;One night I heard Schoenberg on the phonograph and<br/>I thought, &apos;Holy cow, he does all the wrong notes at once.&apos; So we<br/>started a 12-tone jazz group.&quot;</p><p>In 1951, through his beatnik friends, he met Joseph Schmidt, a former<br/>student of Schoenberg&apos;s, and studied with him for more than ten years.<br/>During this time, he worked in several ethnic bands, becoming a<br/>virtuoso player in Greek, Turkish, Arabic, and Armenian music.</p><p>Word of his talent began to spread. A 1957 trio for piano, bass, and<br/>drums that included some improvised sections caught the attention of<br/>future BSO conductor Eric Leinsdorf, who commissioned him to write a<br/>piano concerto but never performed it. Around the same time, his<br/>reputation as an improviser who could also read led Gunther Schuller<br/>to ask him to perform a composition by David Dreck dedicated to<br/>Ornette Coleman.</p><p>By the early &apos;60s, Maneri was playing jazz again. In 1962, he made a<br/>pioneering, but unreleased, record for Atlantic combining Greek<br/>melodies, jazz, and 12-tone music. In the quintet was drummer Peter<br/>Dolger, with whom Maneri performed at one of the celebrated St.<br/>Peter&apos;s Peace Church concerts in New York in 1963. The concert was a<br/>personal milestone for Maneri. &quot;At one point I saw the Holocaust; I<br/>started feeling so bad I started crying while I was playing. What I<br/>played changed my life, it&apos;s the style I&apos;ve incorporated up until<br/>today.&quot;</p><p>After that, Maneri dropped out. He lived out of his car, then became a<br/>hospital orderly. Eventually, he returned to teaching in 1970, when<br/>Robert DiDomenica asked him to teach theory and composition at the New<br/>England Conservatory.</p><p>At NEC, his composing took a new turn when, in 1972, he began using<br/>microtones, the intervals between the sharps and flats in a<br/>conventional Western scale. Since then, he has founded the Boston<br/>Microtonal Society, written a book, and invented a microtonal<br/>keyboard. Currently he teaches the only course in microtonal<br/>composition in the US.</p><p>One of the first of his microtonal pieces, a quartet for clarinet,<br/>trombone, tuba, and piano, is entitled _Ephphatha_, meaning &quot;open up.&quot;<br/>The title holds special significance for Maneri. &quot;I often tell<br/>students, stay open to the spirit of your soul, stay open to the<br/>spirit of your heart, and stay open to the spirit of your mind, and if<br/>there&apos;s nothing in your mind, go put something in it.&quot; Advice Maneri<br/>can give, since he&apos;s followed it his whole life.</p></div>
