For example I would choose to base the weighting on 4:7 rather<br/>&gt;than 7:8 (or 2:7) because 4:7 occurs in 4:5:6:7:9:11. For the same reason I<br/>&gt;would weight for 6:7 rather than 3:7.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t want to compromise the tuning of the 7:8 or the 3:7 because<br/>tuning them right may be even more important in the chords in which they<br/>appear, than tuning 4:7 and 6:7 right is important in 4:5:6:7:9:11. The<br/>latter is pretty clear and so can withstand quite a bit of distortion.</p></div><h3><a id=2488 href="#2488">ðŸ”—</a>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>4/22/1999 10:38:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt; The context of chords like this hexad will tend to increase<br/>&gt; the tolerance of each interval ...&lt;snip&gt;...<br/>&gt; For some reason, this is true of the lowest identities as well,<br/>&gt; where roughness, not tonalness, is the operative constraint<br/>&gt; on tuning -- some of the fifths on my off-meantone piano<br/>&gt; are yucky on their own, but complete the triad and they sound<br/>&gt; fine.</p><p>I&apos;m confused now - isn&apos;t it tonalness that causes this effect?<br/>I mean, isn&apos;t it because of tonalness that notes which<br/>sound dissonant in dyads &apos;sound fine&apos; when in the context<br/>of a triad?</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=2509 href="#2509">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

But what Dave Keenan and I seem to have<br/>come to is that for simple intervals like the fifth, roughness is a much<br/>more stringent constraint than tonalness. In other words, while a fifth of<br/>720 cents has virtually no chance of being interpreted as any ratio other<br/>than 3/2, and so its tonalness is strong, with most timbres the roughness is<br/>too much to bear. Now adding a major third above the root (at, say, 400<br/>cents) makes for a pretty nice triad (in fact, it&apos;s that of 15-tET); the<br/>dissonance of the fifth is alleviated somewhat. But since the tonalness of<br/>the fifth was strong to begin with, and it was only its roughness that made<br/>it unacceptable, the good sound of the triad poses a bit of a puzzle.<br/>Perhaps it&apos;s the average roughness per interval, rather than the total<br/>roughness, that better represents that component of dissonance.
