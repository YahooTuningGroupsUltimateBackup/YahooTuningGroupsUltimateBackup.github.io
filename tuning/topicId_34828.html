(this extends to my<br/>personal business matters too, beyond anything having to<br/>do with music or tuning.)</p><p>it would be wonderful, for me  a n d   for the rest of the<br/>tuning community, if i could make enough money from the<br/>tuning work i do, that i could just do that full-time.</p><p>i&apos;d be extremely happy, and the rest of you would continue<br/>to get an undending stream of webpages from me, explaining<br/>nooks and crannies of tuning theory that probably the vast<br/>majority of readers out there find incomprehensible.</p><p>i&apos;m not really using this forum to complain about the<br/>situation ... it&apos;s really just a request for help.</p><p>there are 572 readers of this list out there today<br/>(which is the reason why i posted it here and not metatuning),<br/>many of whom enjoy my work and find it very useful, and at<br/>least a few of whom might be able to offer something<br/>substantial regarding me making a living doing tuning theory.</p><p>i know that several list subscribers are in academic<br/>teaching situations.  i never finished college, so i<br/>don&apos;t have any degrees, which makes it impossible for<br/>me to find an academic job.  but schools vary in their<br/>requirements -- do any of you in academia know of a<br/>position i might be able to obtain?  i&apos;m willing to<br/>live pretty much anywhere in the world, as long as<br/>i can keep doing my tuning work.  (and i&apos;ve been wanting<br/>to live in Paris, in particular, for years.)</p><p>so anyway, this is very personal and now i&apos;m getting<br/>uncomfortable about putting all this into an archived list.<br/>if anyone has offers or suggestions, contact me privately.</p><p>if nothing happens as a result of this, i&apos;m still not<br/>in a position to complain -- i&apos;m making my living now<br/>by teaching music, which is ok.  i&apos;d just rather spend<br/>that time too on the Tuning Dictionary.</p><p>if anyone feels provoked into further public discussion<br/>about this, please do it on metatuning.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 7:42:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/34828">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/34828</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as i said, the problem with me is that i&apos;m so uninterested<br/>&gt; in the business end of things.  i&apos;m willing to sacrifice my<br/>&gt; time to use it to make Tuning Dictionary webpages, rather<br/>&gt; than dealing with business matters.
