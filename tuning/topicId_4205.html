The guitar was built by Steve Ripley, and there&apos;s a picture at <a href="http://www.vai.com/Machines/html/gtr045.html">http://www.vai.com/Machines/html/gtr045.html</a> .</p><p>The song he used it on, &quot;Deep Down Into The Pain&quot;... well, I&apos;ve heard it, and I still don&apos;t quite believe it. Think heavy metal mixed with the sound of childbirth...</p><p>I was on this list some years back, and posted a bit on modulating 19ET scales with a sine function to improve the &quot;fit&quot; of the major intervals... I&apos;m going to have to regenerate the formulae and get an instrument capable of playing it - at the moment I&apos;m generating pure intervals with the CoolEdit audio editor, which is extremely preceise, but not very spontaneous. More later when I get it together. Cheers,</p><p>Brian Thomson, London UK<br/><a href="mailto:bnt@email.com">bnt@email.com</a><br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>FREE!
