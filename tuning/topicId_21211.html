D to A, in particular, would vary... in some cases<br/>&gt;even being 40/27!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Using a Pythagorean chain as a basis, since it is the foundation of<br/>&gt;the staff system, really makes a lot of sense, and it is totally<br/>&gt;transposible.... Wow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But, composers such as David Doty and Kyle Gann are writing big pieces<br/>&gt;in the Ben Johnston system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is this to say that their pieces really aren&apos;t coming out as they<br/>&gt;think they are???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That would be a little discouraging, to say the least!</p><p>It would also be absurd.</p><p>Of course I know that the &quot;fifth&quot; D-A in the conventional 5-limit major<br/>scale is a 40:27.  I assume Mr. Gann knows this as well as I do. The<br/>Johnston notation, if one understands it correctly, does not misrepresent<br/>any interval.  I am not really that interested in systems of notation.  I&apos;m<br/>used to the Johnston system; it works for my purposes.  If you prefer<br/>something else, use it.  As far as I&apos;m concerned, any system that tries to<br/>represent extended JI on the conventional five-line staff will have<br/>problems.  It&apos;s just a matter of which set of problems you&apos;re willing to accept.</p><p>==========================================================================<br/>David B.
