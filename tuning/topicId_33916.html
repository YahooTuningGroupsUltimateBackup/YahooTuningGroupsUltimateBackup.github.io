Note that his book takes a much more JI approach to<br/>&gt; &gt; what music and musicians do, even implying the use of 11 and 13<br/>&gt; &gt; limit entities in the performance of &quot;in tune&quot; Western music. Since<br/>&gt; &gt; this doesn&apos;t match at all what I hear, I have some scepticism about<br/>&gt; &gt; theorizing he may make, regardless of the quality of his choral<br/>&gt; &gt; directing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; I join you in that skepticism, Bob. I learned a lot during my months on the<br/>&gt; list. Too bad I can&apos;t go back and modify all the copies of my books. At<br/>&gt; least I&apos;ll be a bit more cautious in any future writing.</p><p>Hi Jerry,</p><p>You left for a round of golf about a year and half ago and here you<br/>are. Sounds about like my game...</p><p>Regarding whatever skepticism we may have now, I probably would have said the<br/>same things (or attempted to say something like it) as in your book, regarding<br/>tuning. A lot of my thoughts have been challenged and changed since joining this<br/>list and to your credit, you did get a lot of &quot;message&quot; out there to the musical<br/>masses who think that the number 12 is the basis for all of music past, present<br/>and future.</p><p>Meanwhile, regarding the high third, it may well be that there is no pure<br/>psychoacoustic-physiological basis for a specific frequency or ratio. If we<br/>accept that, then one could start to conject the same for the variety of<br/>neutral intervals in Arabic/Turkish/Persian musics (despite their theorists)<br/>as well as &quot;blue notes&quot;. Maybe people just choose the note that sounds good,<br/>given SOME amount of psychoacoustic-physiological and many helpings of cultural<br/>&quot;stuff&quot;.</p><p>Nice to read your voice again,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
