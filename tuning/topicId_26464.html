One plays 4, 5, 6<br/>-- c, e, g; the other 3, 4, 5 a fourth higher -- c, f, a. The d is<br/>still missing, and you&apos;d have to assume either that the melodic<br/>8-9-10 is somehow ingrained in the melodic culture anyway, or (more<br/>likely) that the lures really played an octave higher. This means<br/>they could also play the seventh and the 11th harmonic, but didn&apos;t.<br/>(Today&apos;s alphorns play in this range and often skirt them; &quot;minor&quot;<br/>pieces making heavy use of the 7th and 11th harmonic are rare).</p><p>This would have two implications:</p><p>You don&apos;t have to derive a hexachord from a pythagorean pentatonic<br/>with one leading note or from a diatonic with one note missing (*).<br/>It also means that property (how I hope to have this term right) is<br/>not an issue for this music, since it would have been so easy to<br/>include the 7th harmonic of the lower instrument.

I&apos;m<br/>interested: Is there nevertheless some kind of preference for<br/>hexachord-like six tone ragas?</p><p>What is &quot;hexachord-like&quot; in my definition? In Western white-note<br/>terms: the gamut is c d e f g a. The A is introduced in stepwise<br/>motion from below and falls right back to g  -- this can be delayed<br/>by an intervening f (and further by the high c, i.e. the whole F<br/>triad).<br/>In other words, an A always goes down, either by a 9/10 or a 4/5.<br/>A-E and A-D don&apos;t occur; A-D would be 27/20 in my derivation, but<br/>there is actually nothing that would prohibit A-E except maybe the<br/>strong harmonic implications of a fourth in this context (sounds of<br/>4:5:6,<br/>implying a c# to come).<br/>The finals I know of are C (German children&apos;s songs) or D (Guido&apos;s<br/>example for the hexachord, &quot;Ut queant laxis&quot;, which not unlikely is<br/>from a different tuning tradition: there is a D-A, although between<br/>phrases.<br/>Structurally important tones are C and G (childrens&apos; songs) or D and<br/>G (Guido&apos;s hymn). In other words, &quot;Ut queant laxis&quot; does not make a<br/>great distinction between CDE and FGA: everything tends to the<br/>central note. In the childrens&apos; songs, this is true for FGA only.<br/>CDE tends towards C or extends itself to G via F.</p></div><h3><a id=26465 href="#26465">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 6:24:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@z...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance, you can derive an improper structure like the<br/>&gt; hexachord (almost) directly from a pair of lures.</p><p>What&apos;s a lure, in this context?</p><p>&gt; One plays 4, 5, 6<br/>&gt; -- c, e, g; the other 3, 4, 5 a fourth higher -- c, f, a.</p><p>There&apos;s that fourth!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to derive a hexachord from a pythagorean pentatonic<br/>&gt; with one leading note or from a diatonic with one note missing (*).<br/>&gt; It also means that property (how I hope to have this term right) is<br/>&gt; not an issue for this music, since it would have been so easy to<br/>&gt; include the 7th harmonic of the lower instrument.</p><p>You mean propriety?
