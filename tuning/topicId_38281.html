But they &quot;leave room&quot; for<br/>the operation of intuition,  so that when these materials are deployed on<br/>the surface, to make a piece of music happen,  those &quot;natural&quot; instincts<br/>come in to play, desperately  attempting to deploy the recalcitrant,<br/>cognitively/acoustically  &quot;disobedient&quot; materials in some way that, if<br/>only provisionally, locally,  in different ways at different instants,<br/>satisfies  the desires  of those  instincts.</p><p>The result is a music where fragments of the &quot;familiar&quot;--- broken-off<br/>chunks of familiar progressions,  forgotten harmonic entities, tonal<br/>chords, simple voice-leading progressions  and so  on---are juxtaposed in<br/>twisted, novel fashion,  warping and changing our  perspective on those<br/>&quot;familiar&quot;  objects in unexpected ways.</p><p>Or, as in the case of &quot;hard-core algorithmic&quot; music, where, basically,<br/>some kind of process or generating system is set up, seeded, and the<br/>piece, as it were, writes itself. . . . . in this case, it is in OUR ears,<br/>the ears of the listener, where this recognition of the familiar takes<br/>place.</p><p>In either case, the way we parse through such pieces, looking for some<br/>vague  cognitive  signposts. . . . gradually expanding registers,<br/>step-wise  &quot;bass&quot; lines,   serendipitous fragments of tonality  bridged by<br/>walls of  impenetrable  chaos. . .  .this ad hoc parsing is a fascinating<br/>for me---to experience as a listener, and to try to facilitate in my<br/>music, as a composer.</p><p>In a way, these kinds of pieces are written in a higher-level language (to<br/>borrow a term from computer science),  because these little &quot;bursts&quot; of<br/>the familiar, these fragile  &quot;handholds&quot; that we &quot;grab onto&quot; to &quot;survive&quot; as<br/>listeners, are often like &quot;signifiers&quot;, standing for whole passages of<br/>music in more traditional musical environments.</p><p>Thus in any piece by Milton Babbitt, for example, I&apos;m not listening for<br/>rows,  or serial structures at all.  What I enjoy in this music is all the<br/>sudden bursts of familiar objects popping out at me.   Or,  noticing the<br/>way my mind takes note of what it&apos;s hearing.    Thus, late in<br/>the 2nd Piano Concerto,  a swirling chaos of notes seems somehow to<br/>magically coalesce into C# Major,  so strongly that the passage seems to<br/>me to be the &quot;climax&quot;  (a very little hill in this very flat piece) of the<br/>work.</p><p>At another point in this piano concerto,  there is a series<br/>of what sound like  chromatically descending chords in the<br/>brass, in the midst of other activity---but this chromatic descent, as<br/>something vaguely familiar or simple to me, is what I &quot;grab onto&quot; in this<br/>part of the piece.

Is it because I want to<br/>write butt-ugly music that always  avoids octaves<br/>and tonal triads and other marks of the familiar?  No, it&apos;s precisely<br/>BECAUSE I DO want to use those elements,  re-contextualized and juxtaposed<br/>in odd, bizarre, and unexpected ways that shed new light on the objects<br/>themselves.</p><p>As a composer, then, I&apos;m interested in systematic composition, like<br/>serialism, but I&apos;m not interested in serialism as a language in and of<br/>itself, but rather, in using it as a fragmentor of the familiar.<br/>(Likewise, to the person who asks, &quot;Well, if you want to use triads, why<br/>don&apos;t you just write tonal music?&quot;---again, the point is that I want to<br/>only *refer* to  tonal syntax, in the midst of my joyful arbitrarity.)</p><p>Actually, I think it&apos;s more complex than that:  I think the best serial<br/>pieces from the old days, were written with this state of mind going on,<br/>at least  subconsciously---the composers back then insisted that they were<br/>interested in serialism as a language in and of itself---but<br/>sub-consciously, the reason that the best of those pieces work well,  is<br/>that the composers were thinking this way--i.e., desparately trying to<br/>&quot;fake&quot; a familiar, &quot;cognitively correct&quot; syntax in the midst of this<br/>other,  artificial syntax that they were trying to be true to.  And that<br/>is the state of mind, as a composer, that I want to be in as I write<br/>certain of my pieces:  I&apos;m literally interested in &quot;pretending&quot; that I<br/>believe in the purity  and goodness of artificial systems in and of<br/>themselves, but behind my own  back, I&apos;m sneaking in their usage as<br/>fragmenters of the familiar.</p><p>(This also rules out some system, such as one I glossed over in another<br/>PNM article by Ciro Scotto, that tries to &quot;marry&quot; tonal syntax with<br/>set-theory or some such idea.
