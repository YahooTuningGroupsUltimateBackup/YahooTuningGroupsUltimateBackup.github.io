It seems when he played the<br/>Barcarolle is in F-sharp major he could have just tuned it to that key. There is no reason to think that tuning practice were uniform throughtout europe. It is hard to guess what was going on in poland and maybe he liked all those &apos;weird&apos; intervals. i know that the &apos;devil&apos;s interval&apos; has been moved from the tritone to the 40/27 and the 27/20 and like intervals, but maybe know one told the audience and everybody had a great time in the ol parlor.

Chopin is so harmonically adventurous, too, well beyond the<br/>&gt; constraints of 5-limit triadic writing. Historically, it doesn&apos;t ring true either. He would<br/>&gt; most likely be using any of the post-Bach well-temperaments if he were anything<br/>&gt; like his contemporaries!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find this anecdote hard to believe.
