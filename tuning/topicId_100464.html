I still haven&apos;t worked out some kind of<br/>precise formula for it but that&apos;s the gist of it. It&apos;s also one of the neat<br/>techniques that rank-3 scales make available to us, which I think might be<br/>more useful to explore than 3GMP scales.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sat, Jul 2, 2011 at 6:50 AM, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After years in the making, my PDF on Trojan output from<br/>&gt; Tripod input is now finished:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/magic/trip-trojan.pdf">http://x31eq.com/magic/trip-trojan.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It outlines how you can write music using one pitch system,<br/>&gt; and produce scores in a different system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Graham</p></div><h3><a id=100515 href="#100515">ðŸ”—</a>Tim Reeves &#x3C;reevest360@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2011 4:26:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Graham<br/>&nbsp;<br/>wow, I think I can relate to your system...it seems&nbsp; like I could easily adapt it to a natural whole tone and half tone system, ie, where there are 8 whole tone&nbsp;notes, then the octave, with the half tones being easily designated with sharps or flats.

Comparing the results of this method with those of other approaches shows that it is indeed viable...just look at my post that compares my natural quarter tone scale with the dwarf 19 edo scale that (is available&nbsp; on scala but) was posted on the tuning group earlier this week.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>You would be correct in thinking that this is a different method&nbsp;than what most microtuners use.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;This is only the basis, it is expandable to include other natural numeric systems and certainly more treatments. The result is a very organized approach to deriving scale values. You will see that all intervals are eventually revealed with this system, no matter how bizarre or well conceived that someone&apos;s &quot;new&quot; or &quot;historically ancient&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;interval value may be.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;Here&apos;s a good question for the group:<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Is there any concensus on how to notate beyond sharps and flats???&nbsp; I can easily write values of quarter tone, eighth tone etc but haven&apos;t really seen a system that everyone who microtunes will adhere to.

For example, a notation for just intonation is usually designed to indicate the prime factors of ratios, but the symbols tend to get cumbersome with complex ratios and may not be very suitable for notating complex temperaments.  With Sagittal, the symbols are relatively simple, and they may be used for both complex JI and all sorts of temperaments.  Although there are many symbols in the system, the simpler tunings require only a small subset.  The symbols are logically constructed from only a few symbol elements (called &quot;flags&quot;).</p><p>You may also notice that the Sagittal paper is the source of the term &quot;trojan&quot;, as it appears in the subject line of this thread.</p><p>--George</p></div>
