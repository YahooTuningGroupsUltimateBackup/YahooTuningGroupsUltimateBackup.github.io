This did not happen in his life  time.</p><p>JR: This is true.</p><p>KG:  While he expanded timbre with new instruments there  is the very<br/>definate use of pitch from top to bottom that i think we are  trained t<br/>otune out as being important.</p><p>JR: I&apos;m not totally clear on what you are saying here.   But I am a big fan<br/>of Partch&apos;s music.</p><p>KG:  HP had an ear and concept of pitch and pitch  matrix that was phenomenal.<br/>this is quite different than the the concept of  pitch being variable<br/>within a certain range.</p><p>JR:  I disagree. Why mythologilize him?  He worked  hard to hear and tune as<br/>he went along, and with the aid of absolute  pitch.  Why else hammer brads<br/>between the strings of his adapted  viola?  No violist would do that to an<br/>instrument today.</p><p>KG: Something that became a necessity in late<br/>romanic  music in order to handle the realm of modulations taking place.<br/>I think  Gene&apos;s Smith follows and has concern for solving the problem<br/>posed by this  music.<br/>There is the meeting between partch and boulez that resulted in  the<br/>exchanges of punches.(according to Johnston)<br/>It was a meeing that  lasted about as long as popper and wittenstein!<br/>( i still get more out of  popper than quine)</p><p>JR: You lost me with quine.  Boulez protested against  Stravinsky in the<br/>streets of Paris.  I have never felt the least interest  to interact with him over<br/>many years of possibilities.  Partch could  destroy hotel rooms and private<br/>homes, based on my New York contacts.   Temper of the human kind must also be<br/>considered.  It could have some  connection to the inharmonicity of his<br/>percussion.  Hmmn?</p><p>KG:  Obviously the meaning changed.<br/>I respect your  work johnny but to define all music as microtonal for<br/>me personally doesn&apos;t  do much for me. It is like saying all music is<br/>tonal or melodic.</p><p>JR:  Microtonality the pitch parameter of music.   Not all music is tonal,<br/>nor melodic.  But there is a pitch parameter in all  music, even percussion.  As<br/>you said, &quot;the meaning changed.&quot;</p><p>KG:  I prefer to take a stance than new intervals  require<br/>new <a href="http://music.one">music.one</a> cannot use wood like metal. etc.</p><p>JR:  You are right here.  I totally agree.   Only, I don&apos;t want to use any<br/>one tuning as a reference, not ET nor just.   Just could be overtone or cyclic<br/>or with a common prime number, etc., for too  many different takes.</p><p>KG: La Monteyoung is an intering case where he changed the  music first and<br/>then foiund the right microtonality for it. This is probably  what<br/>cultures around the world have done in many instances.<br/>But i will let  johnny have the last word on this cause i think it is<br/>interesting how  different people end up at the same intersection even<br/>though they are going  different direction.</p><p>JR: Microtonality is tripped of style.  It transcends  ethnicity, and time.<br/>It is quantifiable by ear only in the present  century.  It is new for the<br/>imagination.  And descriptive terms needs  to catch up.</p><p>KG:  In general i think this happen quite a bit in all  the arts, one can<br/>find oneself at the same point, even sounding similar to  someone else<br/>but often one is moving tangentally to others and it leads  to<br/>different things. the notion of &quot;influence&quot; i think is a bit limited<br/>in  actually describing what is going on</p><p>JR:  How a person constitutes a  mental construct for tuning in their minds<br/>largely influences how they will  describe it.  I long ago noticed how few<br/>people have a perfect match with  mine.
