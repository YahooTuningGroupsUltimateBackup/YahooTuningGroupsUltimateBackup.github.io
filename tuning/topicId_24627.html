Prime example: why is<br/>stereo output and not quad- or octophonic the standard on soundcards?<br/>The Vista Cruiser overboiled and I ended up overnighting it in Fresno<br/>while the mechanics put things in order.  At least the Basque Hotel<br/>on F Street is still a good deal, if you can handle the rooms without<br/>baths and fried sweetbreads in tomato sauce. Why do I need more than<br/>two channels? EASY -- if you want to really have audibly<br/>polymicrotonal electronic music, then you&apos;ve got to put each tuning<br/>in its own channel. (That&apos;s the kind of idea that&apos;ll come to you<br/>while dreaming off a stomach full of sweetbreads). Here&apos;s my dream 8-<br/>channel setup ---- one pair of in-the-ear plugs, one set of over-the-<br/>ear headphones, the quad speakers from the Vista (four speakers but<br/>only stereo input), and a pair of bone conductors. (Is it just me, or<br/>is the cochlea SERIOUSLY overrated as an input device for music?)<br/>I&apos;ll put the coarser tunings in the bones and the cruiser and the<br/>more micro in the headphones. Shared tones in the tunings can go left-<br/>right, up-down, forward-back, or to the pairs of headphone/speaker<br/>types.  At the moment, I&apos;ll try it with two stereo cassette tapes and<br/>the stereo outputs from a notebook computer and a keyboard, played<br/>live, with macrotonal scales assigned to halves of the keyboard, each<br/>output on a separate channel. SIMULTANEOUS: 7, 11, 33 and 35 ETS, 7th<br/>root of 7:5 and 10th root of 11/7 non-octave scales!!!! It&apos;s<br/>provisional, but it&apos;s real, and I can hear it all without theoretical<br/>assistance, but a quick trip to the oxygen bar may be in order. -mcl.</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2001 1:03:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve mentioned the spatial collage music of Henry Brant before as a<br/>good example of an existing model for combining tunings.</p><p>In his massive collages he goes for maximum separation and often<br/>employs elaborate spatial designs to help insure something like a<br/>maximum opportunity for clarity amongst all the various stylistic<br/>(etc.) forces.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s easy to see how this same approach could be carried over<br/>to combining tunings. And your idea here reminds me of this.</p><p>Brant himself does this as well to a degree, but not by formal design.<br/>It&apos;s simply an interesting byproduct of some of the wild combinations<br/>that he employs (gamelan and bluegrass ensembles for example!) all<br/>speaking in their native tongue.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
