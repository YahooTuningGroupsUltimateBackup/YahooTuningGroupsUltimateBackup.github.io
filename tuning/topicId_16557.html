And further, how do we intend to measure this sort of<br/>thing?  Even if there was a way to get spectral data that<br/>accurate, the process of assigning fundamentals to the parts, in<br/>order to measure their &quot;accuracy&quot; with respect to JI, isn&apos;t<br/>determined to within +/- 0.5 cents by any existing method.</p><p>&gt;In light of the above challenge, can it truly be shown that<br/>&gt;Barbershop Quartet singing is really the ironclad and unshakeable<br/>&gt;proof we need of the definition of JI? To clarify my point here: If<br/>&gt;indeed a &quot;beatlessness&quot; is perceived in the chords of this music, and<br/>&gt;yet we are saying also that there must be &quot;within +-0.5 cents&quot;<br/>&gt;accuracy for it to truly be considered JI, then which am I to<br/>&gt;understand is correct; an audible quality of beatlessness, or<br/>&gt;the &quot;within +-0.5 cents&quot; rendered accuracy of the performance?</p><p>Obviously the former.  Accuracy of barbershop?  Their singers are<br/>capable of sustained chords tuned beatless to the limit of the timbres.<br/>See my post, &quot;Barbershop Spectrogram&quot;, circa Dec. &apos;98 (the files for<br/>the post are temp. off line, but I will provide them upon request).</p><p>[JdL]<br/>&gt;The only question is whether +-5 cents qualifies as &quot;true JI&quot; vs.<br/>&gt;&quot;quasi-JI&quot;.

If anyone disagrees, then<br/>he should provide the criteria that were used to arrive at these<br/>numbers, and why a binary distinction around them is warranted.</p><p>Further, given the multiplicity of criteria sets, with respect to<br/>physics (limit, timbre, volume), effect (beating, periodicity), and<br/>affect (noticeable difference, annoying difference, etc.), he should<br/>explain why the particular criteria set should be the basis for the<br/>definition of such a basic and general term as &quot;just intonation&quot;.</p><p>I must be crazy.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=16561 href="#16561">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2000 9:30:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16557">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16557</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Monz]<br/>&gt; &gt; For the record, note that I agree pretty much with Dave<br/>&gt; &gt; Keenan&apos;s restriction to &quot;within +-0.5 cents&quot; for a true<br/>&gt; &gt; JI label.

There, I said it.</p><p>Given the difficulty we&apos;re having here of definining JI,<br/>I&apos;m not at all sure what would be the right response to<br/>this.</p><p>But I *can* say that Young&apos;s primary interest, AFAIK,<br/>is in exploring the affect/effect produced by high-prime<br/>harmonic relationships.  Since it&apos;s apparent that he<br/>agrees with me (again invoking my concept of &quot;finity&quot;)<br/>that high-prime ratios can easily be misperceived as<br/>lower-prime ratios, it&apos;s extremely important for his<br/>purposes to achieve the most accurate and most stable<br/>tuning resolution possible.</p><p>How easily that &quot;misperception&quot; occurs depends on many<br/>aspects, primarily the duration over which a precisely-tuned<br/>ratio is sustained.  That&apos;s the main reason Young&apos;s<br/>Dream House sustains its pitches over what is theoretically<br/>an inifinite period of time.  He&apos;s interested in bathing<br/>his own ears in these sounds for weeks, months, or even years<br/>at a time, and studying what kind of effect they have<br/>on his nervous system.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing to note about Young&apos;s<br/>compositions is that, mainly because of these incredibly<br/>long durations, they are radically different from<br/>&quot;traditional&quot; music.  That&apos;s why I point out his music<br/>as an exception in so many of my posts on this thread.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3><a id=16564 href="#16564">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2000 10:15:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To supplement what I wrote in:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16561">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16561</a></p><p>I just thought I&apos;d give a few more leads on info<br/>about Young&apos;s Dream House:</p><p>From:<br/><a href="http://www.virtulink.com/mela/S&LPRESS.HTM">http://www.virtulink.com/mela/S&LPRESS.HTM</a></p><p>&gt; Young has stated that: &quot;This is my newest and most<br/>&gt; radical work; the Rayna synthesizer has made it<br/>&gt; possible to realize intervals which are derived<br/>&gt; from such high primes that, not only is it unlikely<br/>&gt; that anyone has ever worked with these intervals<br/>&gt; before, it is also highly unlikely that anyone has<br/>&gt; ever heard them or perhaps even imagined the<br/>&gt; feelings they create.&quot;</p><p>Kyle Gann&apos;s description of the Dream House is in<br/>&quot;The Tingle of p x mn - 1 (installations by La Monte<br/> Young and Marian Zazeela)&quot;<br/>_Village Voice_, October 4, 1994 (Vol. XXXIX No. 40, p. 84);<br/>reproduced at:</p><p><a href="http://www.virtulink.com/mela/GANN.HTM">http://www.virtulink.com/mela/GANN.HTM</a></p><p>Unfortunately, neither of these pages gives the specifics<br/>on the tuning resolution of Young&apos;s custom-made Rayna synth.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3><a id=16593 href="#16593">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>12/14/2000 8:46:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote (in &quot;JI Fudge factor&quot;):</p><p>&gt;See my post, &quot;Barbershop Spectrogram&quot;, circa Dec. &apos;98 (the files for<br/>&gt;the post are temp. off line, but I will provide them upon request).</p><p>Carl,</p><p>I can&apos;t find this post in the archive.

I&apos;m in the middle of moving right<br/>now, and I&apos;m a bit stressed out.  At the same time, this thread is<br/>throwing around a lot of very haughty-sounding stuff, without making<br/>a whole lot of sense.</p><p>&gt;I thought you were the guy who wants infinitely rigid vertical springs<br/>&gt;(i.e. exact vertical JI) in his tunings!</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt;Or you saying that any attempt to quantify a limit of true JI in cents<br/>&gt;is misguided?</p><p>Exactly.  You&apos;d have to specify all the things I list to make it<br/>meaningful.</p><p>&gt;Yet, am I understanding you correctly here as saying that an unqualified<br/>&gt;&quot;JI&quot; should apply to +-5 cents?</p><p>To find out exactly what I am saying, let&apos;s go over my definitions again.<br/>I distinguish between the _intention_ of JI (my &quot;general&quot; definition),<br/>which is used when speaking broadly of music (dissonant, approximating<br/>JI, etc.), and is largely determined by the _composition_.  As opposed<br/>to the use of the term &quot;JI&quot; to mean &quot;precision tuning&quot; (the &quot;special&quot;<br/>definition), where an increase in the blend of the sound is _practically_<br/>impossible given the timbres and instruments used.</p><p>I do acknowledge the unique utility of JI (both strict and &quot;extended<br/>reference&quot;) in melody, but the term is used for this meaning so<br/>infrequently that I would expect the author to use &quot;melodic JI&quot;, or<br/>&quot;strict JI&quot;, or &quot;classical JI&quot;, etc.</p><p>So meantone is, generally speaking, JI, but specifically, it is not<br/>JI, since one is deliberately tuning away from the smoothest sounds<br/>(that is, one _could_ -- _practically_, he could do better).</p><p>The main feature of my definitions is that they work for all timbres.<br/>Certainly, integer-based definitions cannot.  They require a restriction<br/>on timbre.  But I haven&apos;t seen a single one of these definitions that<br/>offers a precise restriction.  I&apos;ve seen stuff like, &quot;harmonic timbres&quot;,<br/>but what exactly constitutes a &quot;harmonic timbre&quot;?  Howabout the sound<br/>of a 9&apos; concert grand?  An old spinet?  What about a synthesized timbre<br/>that starts out harmonic but turns inharmonic as it decays?  How do you<br/>even determine the fundamental of certain timbres (as on many old<br/>pianos, where the determination of fundamental is one of the most<br/>important things a piano tuner does to produce a good tuning)?  Aside<br/>from this, any reasonable integer-based definition requires a smallness<br/>restriction (as Dave Keenan points out).  But how small is small?  It<br/>depends on the musical context -- does such belong in a definition?<br/>Also, while on a large scale, complexity does go up with the size of the<br/>numbers in the ratios, on a small scale this is not uniform, and the<br/>theory required to predict it -- harmonic entropy -- is not complete.</p><p>So why do we still have pushers of timbre-specific and integer-based<br/>definitions running around claiming they&apos;ve got the whole thing wrapped<br/>up?  I&apos;m all for coming up with specifics regarding timbres and smallness<br/>(which is why I&apos;m on the harmonic entropy list), but claiming you&apos;ve got<br/>this stuff covered when you obviously don&apos;t is irresponsible.</p><p>&gt;(as I&apos;ve said, I routinely tolerate vertical deviations of around +-5<br/>&gt;cents in my adaptive work, and don&apos;t care, except to achieve some<br/>&gt;convention for clear communication, whether this is called &quot;adaptive JI&quot;<br/>&gt;or &quot;adaptive quasi-JI&quot;)</p><p>As I understood it, the term &quot;adaptive JI&quot; was used to specify stuff<br/>about the size of a pitch set over time, independent of the accuracy<br/>of harmonies.  I would call your +-5 cent sprung stuff adaptive<br/>temperament.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I must be crazy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m missing something.  Please explain.</p><p>Just another one of my frequent trips into self-righteous insanity.</p><p>&quot;...On one of my frequent trips to the ground, I noticed Maloy was<br/>wearing sneakers... for _sneaking_!&quot;</p><p>[Monz]<br/>&gt;For the Dream House, La Monte Young commissioned a<br/>&gt;specially-designed synthesizer from David Rayna which<br/>&gt;is extremely accurate.
