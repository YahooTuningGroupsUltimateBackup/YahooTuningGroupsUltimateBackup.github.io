When one makes the MIDI<br/>tuning file to tune the instrument one selects among a menu of synths<br/>so it has to be one of those.  You should ask Manuel Op deCoul, the<br/>inventor, to make sure.</p><p>&gt; If you need to know I am interested on the Voce V5 organ simulator<br/>&gt; module.<br/>&gt;<br/>***I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve seen anything like this on the list, but you<br/>should ask Manuel to make sure...</p><p>best,</p><p>J.
