This was a liberating<br/>experience, Miles said, giving him confidence to go beyond the rules of<br/>music.</p></div><h3><a id=41624 href="#41624">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E; &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2002 10:57:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Whoa, Dante!</p><p>Great catch on that one - I&apos;m definately going to check out the Davis book.</p><p>Partch probably got more street cred from jazz musicians than he ever got from the &apos;classical&apos; field. It isn&apos;t surprising that his three big music-dramas composed and produced at the University of Illinois were made possible in large part by John Garvey, who was also instrumental in their jazz department, and that &quot;Water! Water!&quot; incorporated a jazz band intrinsically into the libretto and composition.</p><p>Tack this on to the cross-fertilization in the preceding years in Sausalito, with &quot;Ulysses...&quot; being written with Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan in mind, and visits from Stan Kenton and Shelly Manne.</p><p>If only the right planets had been in alignment...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=41627 href="#41627">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2002 11:32:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Davis also remembered Evans introducing him to the music of John<br/>&gt;Cage in 1948 and loaning him recordings by the iconoclastic<br/>&gt;composer Harry Partch,</p><p>Yet another mention of Cage and Partch in the same paragraph.<br/>Turns the stomach.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=41632 href="#41632">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2002 2:10:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt;&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Tack this on to the cross-fertilization in the preceding years in Sausalito, with &quot;Ulysses...&quot; being written with Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan in mind, and visits from Stan Kenton and Shelly Manne.</p><p>My mother was Chet Baker&apos;s social worker; he had had his teeth knocked out and was down and out, but she thought he was a wonderful man.</p></div>
