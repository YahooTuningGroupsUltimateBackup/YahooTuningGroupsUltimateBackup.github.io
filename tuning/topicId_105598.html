Here<br/>is his charming and germinal parable on &quot;Blarney,&quot; and a recent<br/>post presenting a fine just alternative to 10-EDO.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/blarney.txt">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/blarney.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/102795">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/102795</a>&gt;</p><p>Here, I&apos;ll go a step further by giving some EDO alternatives not<br/>only in the form of JI approximations, but as &quot;near-just&quot;<br/>approximations of those approximations in the MET-24 tuning.<br/>We&apos;ll move from 5-EDO through 12-EDO, with another post to<br/>address the interesting question George raised of 15-EDO.</p><p>Also, with the alternatives for 8-EDO and 11-EDO, we&apos;ll encounter<br/>the Leprechaun Comma, 4225/4224 or 0.409808 cents, which I named<br/>as a tribute both to George&apos;s &quot;Blarney&quot; and to Eire, the Emerald<br/>Isle. It&apos;s appropriately a small comma that I discovered or<br/>rediscovered in the process of approximating small EDO&apos;s, and<br/>thus not unfitting to honor the wee people -- assuming that<br/>this comma, mentioned as unnamed in some previous posts, has not<br/>yet received a name.</p><p>Please be warned some of these small-EDO alternatives have what<br/>might be considered a serious fault: nonparallel fifths!<br/>&quot;Nonparallel fifths&quot; are intervals at or near 3/2 in an emulation<br/>of an EDO without such &quot;conventional fifths&quot; -- say, with all<br/>intervals outside Blackwood&apos;s regular diatonic range from 7-EDO<br/>(685.71 cents) to 5-EDO (720 cents), or from 4/7 to 3/5 of a 2/1<br/>octave. The presence of nonparallel fifths is a good warning that<br/>these tunings are at least variations as &quot;emulations&quot; of the EDO<br/>systems from which they draw their inspiration.</p><p>For 5-EDO, it&apos;s hard to top George Secor&apos;s choice, also available<br/>in the Scala archive as slendro5_2.scl:</p><p>1/1 7/6 4/3 3/2 7/4 2/1</p><p>Here&apos;s the tempered version:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-quasi_5-EDO_F.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/met24-quasi_5-EDO_F.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>! met24-quasi_5-EDO_F.scl<br/>!<br/>One of George Secor&apos;s alternatives for 5-EDO (blarney.txt)<br/> 5<br/>!<br/> 264.84375<br/> 495.70313<br/> 703.12500<br/> 967.96875<br/> 2/1</p><p>Next comes 6-EDO, a tuning associated with the &quot;whole-tone scale&quot;<br/>of Debussy, and one with an air of impressionistic mystery.

It&apos;s appropriately a small comma that I discovered or<br/>&gt; rediscovered in the process of approximating small EDO&apos;s, and<br/>&gt; thus not unfitting to honor the wee people -- assuming that<br/>&gt; this comma, mentioned as unnamed in some previous posts, has not<br/>&gt; yet received a name.</p><p>Since it&apos;s a 13-limit superparticular it was listed on <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/List+of+Superparticular+Intervals">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/List+of+Superparticular+Intervals</a> ; it didn&apos;t yet have a name so I added yours.</p><p>&gt; Please be warned some of these small-EDO alternatives have what<br/>&gt; might be considered a serious fault: nonparallel fifths!<br/>&gt; &quot;Nonparallel fifths&quot; are intervals at or near 3/2 in an emulation<br/>&gt; of an EDO without such &quot;conventional fifths&quot; -- say, with all<br/>&gt; intervals outside Blackwood&apos;s regular diatonic range from 7-EDO<br/>&gt; (685.71 cents) to 5-EDO (720 cents), or from 4/7 to 3/5 of a 2/1<br/>&gt; octave. The presence of nonparallel fifths is a good warning that<br/>&gt; these tunings are at least variations as &quot;emulations&quot; of the EDO<br/>&gt; systems from which they draw their inspiration.</p><p>With cluster scales we can have nonparallel fifths starting and ending on every step!</p><p>&gt; For 5-EDO, it&apos;s hard to top George Secor&apos;s choice, also available<br/>&gt; in the Scala archive as slendro5_2.scl:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 7/6 4/3 3/2 7/4 2/1</p><p>Here&apos;s my clusterization of this one, which serves as a good example to introduce the concept:</p><p>1/1 {8/7 7/6} {21/16 4/3} {3/2 32/21} 7/4 2/1</p><p>If we analyze this we see that:<br/>* For each cluster, the exact 5edo step occurs between the pair of notes in the cluster.

In a way, it&apos;s what happens in a tuning<br/>like Peppermint or MET-24 for maqam -- and also, by<br/>transposition, in something like George&apos;s 17-WT as well.</p><p>&gt;  As far as I know, the reasons to use JI instead of equal temperament are:</p><p>&gt;  * To have some purely intoned, beatless intervals, and</p><p>True, or &quot;close to beatless&quot; in a near-just unequal temperament.</p><p>&gt;  * To have a variety of subtly different intervals (rather<br/>&gt;  than &quot;homogenized&quot; or &quot;whitewashed&quot; intervals)</p><p>Also true. And this wording can hold regardless of what<br/>people think about questions such as whether superparticular<br/>melodic steps may have any special attraction. Lots of maqam<br/>music features varied steps -- and likewise gamelan music --<br/>without any necessary focus on the superparticular.</p><p>&gt;  I think those two broad categories cover all the reasons<br/>&gt;  that have been put forward. If you know of a reason that<br/>&gt;  falls completely outside those two, please let me know of<br/>&gt;  it!</p><p>Well, if in doubt, &quot;variety of subtly different intervals&quot;<br/>covers lots of the relevant ground!</p><p>&gt;  So, my idea is that both of those goals can be furthered<br/>&gt;  by using an EDO approximation where each EDO step is<br/>&gt;  approximated, not by a single JI ratio, but by a cluster<br/>&gt;  of them that are spaced much closer together than the EDO<br/>&gt;  steps.

Subtle shadings,<br/>primary melodic, are the main point. So your own insight and<br/>the Akkoc research independently arrive at a similar point<br/>with which I strongly agree.</p><p>In fact, sometimes EDO-like notations can actually represent<br/>an &quot;abstract maqam&quot; (or &quot;abstract jins,&quot; a jins, with the<br/>plural form ajnas, being a genus -- a trichord, tetrachord,<br/>or pentachord, usually). Especially with a notation in 17 or<br/>24, the idea of each step as a &quot;cluster&quot; captures lots of<br/>the Near Eastern viewpoint of traditional performers.</p><p>For example, Rast would in 17-notation be 3 2 2. Among some<br/>Turkish or Syrian musicians, we might get something in<br/>practice like 1/1-9/8-26/21-4/3 (0-204-370-498 cents). But<br/>that high neutral third at 26/21, in a Turkish conception,<br/>is really part of a &quot;cluster.&quot; In descending to a final<br/>cadence, one might use 16/13 or possibly 11/9 -- lower,<br/>pulling toward the tonic or final. This is called _cazibe_<br/>or &quot;gravity,&quot; and your cluster concept allows for precisely<br/>this sort of thing.</p><p>Some Turkish musicians go so far as to think of the whole<br/>region between 6/5 and 5/4, say, as &quot;a 3-comma glissando<br/>zone,&quot; with a middle or neutral interval often free to<br/>wander around that zone as the musical context or<br/>performer&apos;s intuition might dictate.</p><p>At a very modest level, something like Peppermint or MET-24<br/>does provide, essentially, a division of the octave into 17<br/>thirdtones plus 7 additional comma pairs. Depending on where<br/>we are in the system, we might have a choice between 26/21<br/>and 11/9; or 7/6 and 13/11, etc.</p><p>[On 4225/4224 or Leprechaun comma]</p><p>&gt;  Since it&apos;s a 13-limit superparticular it was listed on<br/>&gt;  &lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/List+of+Superparticular+Intervals">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/List+of+Superparticular+Intervals</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;  ; it didn&apos;t yet have a name so I added yours.</p><p>Thank you!

And as Jacques Dudon has discussed in his<br/>articles on JI gamelan, we also get the important element of<br/>intervals like 512/441 (21/16 to 32/21) that could serve as<br/>hemifourths of a kind.

I just tried it with 8/7, and get<br/>the sense that it doesn&apos;t quite give this &quot;thirdlike&quot;<br/>impression -- somehow things are just a bit too close. To<br/>get the contrapuntal effect, it might help to have an<br/>additional step at 49/36 say, so that we could resolve a<br/>dyad 21/16-32/21 to 49/36 by stepwise contrary motion.<br/>It would be bit like, in 20-EDO, having 0-240 cents<br/>resolving to a unison on 60 cents.</p><p>But with your 8-note system or more, we get both some pure<br/>7/6 and 7/4 intervals, and that 147/128. As you point out,<br/>in slendric temperament we would get less variety.</p><p>In a Peppermint-34, by the way, we&apos;d have a few locations of<br/>238.566 and 257.338 cents, as well as the usual just 7/6<br/>thirds and 7/4 approximations at 970.967 cents.

Different pitches of the same cluster would be<br/>&gt;  used in different contexts to achieve diversity of<br/>&gt;  expression (or simply pure consonant intervals), but the<br/>&gt;  contrast between them would never be exploited in a<br/>&gt;  cadential resolution such as the one you mention.</p><p>I agree! Your conception is the relevant and correct one for<br/>this project or approach, while my little digression was<br/>actually out of place in this context for two reasons. The<br/>first is exactly as you state: the idea is to have<br/>intonational variations of the same &quot;note,&quot; not a &quot;contrast&quot;<br/>between them. And the second ties in with what you say next.</p><p>&gt;  In other words, resolving from one note of a cluster to<br/>&gt;  another is treating it as an ordinary scale with &gt;5<br/>&gt;  notes, in contrast to what I had in mind which was<br/>&gt;  treating it as a 5-note scale with intonational variants,<br/>&gt;  and using it more similarly to 5edo itself. A resolution<br/>&gt;  has to resolve from one note to another; if the two<br/>&gt;  pitches are intonational variants of the same note then<br/>&gt;  it can&apos;t be a &quot;resolution&quot; without a clash of concepts<br/>&gt;  happening.</p><p>My second reason is a rather simple corollary of your<br/>statement here. A basic implication of 5-EDO or your JI<br/>cluster version is that 240 cents or 147/128, say, is a<br/>&quot;one-step&quot; interval which therefore is not expected to<br/>resolve to a unison by contrary motion, which my<br/>&quot;quasi-third&quot; resolution would require! Indeed, the very<br/>idea of a &quot;third&quot; here has a contrapuntal sense that there<br/>is a &quot;step between&quot; the two notes to which they can both<br/>resolve. And that, indeed, would violate the premise of a<br/>cluster tuning by &quot;treating it as an ordinary scale with &gt;5<br/>notes.&quot;</p><p>In short, you&apos;re obviously right!</p><p>Wishing you a Happy New Year,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
