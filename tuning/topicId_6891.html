His cave was recently rediscovered.  It seems that when he died,<br/>islanders were quick to label his remaining possessions.</p><p>Another story involves the Thracian Timotheous who was a kithara virtuoso<br/>(small k to distinguish from the giant Kithara of Partch).  Timotheous was<br/>banished from Sparta for adding extra strings to the kithara (a hybrid<br/>instrument that was built as a harp with the bottoms of the strings brought<br/>close together for strumming capability).</p><p>Timotheous, who by every reputation was a monster with technique, sought<br/>council from none other than Euripides&apos; cave on Salamis.  Wouldn&apos;t I love to<br/>be the proverbial fly on the wall, or would it all be just Greek to me?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
