That most of these designs tend towards<br/>blurring rather than distinguishing the various distinctions between<br/>free, linear, and logarithmic tuning methodologies only makes sense as<br/>it is consistent with my own musical practice and aesthetic beliefs.</p><p>Here&apos;s a nice little method that allows one to either morph a given<br/>n-over series into its n-under series or a given n-under series into<br/>its n-over series.</p><p>OVER INTO UNDER:</p><p>Where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are any given numbers, an over to under series is<br/>defined as 2n*x with a sequential numerator rule of +2 and a<br/>sequential denominator rule of -(x-1).</p><p>Letting x=1 gives a corresponding n-over series. Increasing the value<br/>of x by 1s works n towards ever more accurate approximations of its<br/>under series.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example using n=4 where x=1,2,3,4,5:</p><p>1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 2/1</p><p>1/1 6/5 10/7 22/13 2/1</p><p>1/1 13/11 7/5 5/3 2/1</p><p>1/1 34/29 18/13 38/23 2/1</p><p>1/1 7/6 11/8 23/14 2/1</p><p>UNDER INTO OVER:</p><p>Where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are any given numbers, an under to over series is<br/>defined as n*x with a sequential numerator rule of +(x-2) and a<br/>sequential denominator rule of -1.</p><p>Letting x=2 gives a corresponding n-under series. Increasing the value<br/>of x by 1s works n towards ever more accurate approximations of its<br/>over series.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example using n=7 where x=2,3,4,5,6:</p><p>1/1 14/13 7/6 14/11 7/5 14/9 7/4 2/1</p><p>1/1 11/10 23/19 4/3 25/17 13/8 9/5 2/1</p><p>1/1 10/9 16/13 34/25 3/2 38/23 20/11 2/1</p><p>1/1 19/17 41/33 11/8 47/31 5/3 53/29 2/1</p><p>1/1 46/41 5/4 18/13 29/19 62/37 11/6 2/1</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
