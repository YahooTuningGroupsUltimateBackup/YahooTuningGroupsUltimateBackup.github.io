It&apos;s really a GREAT<br/>read.  Perhaps it&apos;s just at my present level now or something, but I<br/>can&apos;t seem to put it down... I&apos;m carrying it around with me at all<br/>times!</p><p>I guess one might not think a &quot;dissertation&quot; would read quite so much<br/>like a novella... it really is enjoyable, and seems to be tying many<br/>things together for me.</p><p>In addition, I originally thought that it was primarily on 19-tones per<br/>octave, but it actually is about ALL KINDS of xeno tuning things.<br/>Practically everything, which he groups under the classification<br/>&quot;multiple divisions of the octave.&quot;</p><p>I feel very fortunate that John Chalmers recommended it to me.</p><p>It is too bad such an engrossing work is not published.  (I&apos;m assuming<br/>the rest of the paper is just as interesting -- I&apos;ve read 1/3 so far).</p><p>If the rest of it continues like this, it should be even more of a<br/>standard than the Barbour &quot;Tuning and T.&quot;</p><p>Come to think of it... I believe Johnny Reinhard was making some kind of<br/>plans to distribute this dissertation, but he is involved in so many<br/>different projects presently, I don&apos;t know if it is still available from<br/>him.</p><p>I got it through the dissertation service from the University of<br/>Michigan (my old haunt) microfilms...</p><p><a href="http://www.umi.com/hp/Products/DisExpress.html">http://www.umi.com/hp/Products/DisExpress.html</a></p><p>Remember that Joel&apos;s full name is Mandelbaum, Meyer Joel... and the<br/>title is &quot;Multiple Division of the Octave and the Tonal Resources of<br/>19-tone Temperament.&quot;  (Just Mandelbaum, Joel, as he is mostly known,<br/>won&apos;t find it!)</p><p>The search number, to make things easier is:</p><p>6104461</p><p>Oh... the cost is $29.95 plus tax.  It&apos;s easy to order on-line.</p><p>I&apos;m assuming that everybody on this list except me has read it (??)</p><p>This is a fun item.  Really hip.  Better than MTV....</p><p>___________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
