Before the first drill that first year I made the mistake of<br/>asking if anyone had perfect pitch. Of course, silence.<br/>Well mean-ol&apos;-me! I started presenting intervals on tape. I&apos;d record the<br/>drill and make a copy onto another tape using a tape machine on whose<br/>flywheel I wrapped enough layers of duct tape to change its speed by approx<br/>a quartertone. You can imagine the rest. Suddenly there were two people who<br/>totally blew the whole drill. Lotsa whining. I insisted that we p-pitchers<br/>were not exempt from knowing the sound of the interval itself and that from<br/>now on the pitches would fluctuate from one example to another. Those two<br/>got better real fast.</p></div>
