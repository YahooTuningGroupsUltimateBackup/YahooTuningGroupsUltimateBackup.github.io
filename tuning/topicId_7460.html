Clearly however,<br/>&gt;there is confusion with regard to simply calling any EDO a temperament,<br/>&gt;which is what that was about.</p><p>I asked how temperament was ever mis-applied, and nobody answered.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 4. &quot;microtonal&quot; -- for all non-12 music; if you don&apos;t like implications<br/>&gt;&gt; of strangeness, don&apos;t say anything about tuning to your audience!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Carl, understand that 12EDO is not a universal point of reference. I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt;listening to Middle Eastern, Indian, &amp; 12EDO music all my life. To me they<br/>&gt;are all just tunings, all just music. &quot;micro&quot; nothing.</p><p>So what are you complaining about?  You have no use for any such term.  I<br/>happen to agree with you -- I have very little use for one myself.</p><p>&gt;I can&apos;t believe you&apos;re implying that the handful of terms and theories<br/>&gt;we have are the be all &amp; end all, &amp; that they should never change, or<br/>&gt;expand.</p><p>It&apos;s good you can&apos;t believe it; I&apos;m not implying anything of the sort.</p><p>&gt;Some of it is sort of broke, some is just lovely, while much of it does not<br/>&gt;exist. Such vehement resistance to change and progress is odd, anyhow<br/>&gt;nobody&apos;s forcing anyone to change. You can still call a car a horseless<br/>&gt;carriage, if that&apos;s your pleasure.</p><p>Drew, there are good reasons not to call a car a horseless carriage.  I<br/>have no resistance to change.  But the change should be teleological.</p><p>Keep in mind you&apos;re replying here to something I wrote in reply to a post<br/>by John Starrett.  I was rejecting the idea of a standard, not the idea of<br/>change.  Language has always evolved by people using it.  The standard<br/>makers are notoriously those who don&apos;t use the terms themselves (making a<br/>standard is the only way they can express themselves on the matter), and<br/>nobody who actually uses the words pays attention to them, and the language<br/>goes on as it would have anyway.  People appeal to dictonionaries as if<br/>they were some sort of authority.  Maybe it&apos;s snotty attitude of the<br/>stereotypical grammar teacher.  It&apos;s a great gig, but the speaker is always<br/>the real authority.  Dictionaries are descriptive, not constructive.</p><p>The whole situation is a lot like music theory, actually.  People who don&apos;t<br/>write music sit and describe structure in music that&apos;s already been<br/>written.  Then, they turn around and praise the next composer who<br/>brilliantly breaks the rules, and then they re-write the rules to<br/>accomidate it, and so on.  It all makes perfect sense, as long as you view<br/>it as a descriptive process.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But the terms I&apos;m concerned with aren&apos;t &quot;temperament&quot; or &quot;microtone&quot;.  I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt;much more concerned with &quot;mode&quot;, &quot;5th&quot;, &quot;JI&quot;, etc. We recently won a great<br/>&gt;&gt;victory with &quot;adaptive&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, I guess this means that only what Carl is concerned with is worth<br/>&gt;discussing. Duh.</p><p>No, it means I don&apos;t believe anything is wrong with the current usage of<br/>temperament or microtone.  If you&apos;d show otherwise instead of attacking me,<br/>I&apos;d be happy to discuss it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 10:31:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Is there a name for tunings that do not repeat, i.e. are *endless* ?<br/>&gt;88CET is an example of such a tuning (I think).</p><p>In practice, everything repeats eventually (the audio spectrum is not<br/>actually infinite, as far as human perception is concerned).  All<br/>equal-step tunings are periodic with respect to any interval that spans a<br/>whole number of their steps.  88CET is roughly periodic with respect to<br/>three octaves.  If one values periodicity at an interval which the tuning<br/>does represent with a whole number of steps, such as a single octave of<br/>88CET, then I would say the tuning is &quot;not periodic with respect to the<br/>2/1&quot;.  There is probably a more consice way to cover all this...</p><p>&gt;&gt;You don&apos;t have to hear _about_ them. Until now, I&apos;ve spared you<br/>&gt;&gt;that.

You yourself recently<br/>mentioned that you&apos;ve never tried to influence somebody else -- you&apos;ve just<br/>gone about using your terms for &quot;about a year&quot; on the list.

The issue is that tET does not specifically refer *only* to<br/>&gt;tunings that are EDOs (equal divisions of the octave).</p><p>Drew, perhaps you are not aware of the problems associated with the term<br/>&quot;octave&quot;.  It is often used to mean a 2:1, and you seem to think this is<br/>the only way it is used.  But the term&apos;s origin comes from naming the 8th<br/>(a scale degree) -- this is the use that I prefer (I try to use &quot;2:1&quot;,<br/>&quot;duple&quot;, or &quot;double&quot; for 2:1).  Also, it is quite frequently used to mean a<br/>generic interval of equivalence (a 3:1 in the Bohlen-Pierce scale).  I try<br/>to use &quot;IE&quot; for interval of equivalence.</p><p>&gt;x-cent equal, or simply CE can be viewed as CET minus the &quot;T&quot;. And would be<br/>&gt;specific to tunings that are designed/callibrated in cents. It&apos;s not an<br/>&gt;alternative to EDO.</p><p>x-cent equal can uniquely specify any equal-step tuning.  The same is not<br/>true of tet or EDO.  If one wants the name to tell the number of notes in<br/>the tuning, and the ability to name any equal-step tuning, one needs to use<br/>the xth-root-of n terminology.</p><p>&gt;To say 12tET could mean 12 equal divisions of *any* larger interval, for<br/>&gt;example 3/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;There&apos;s no need to change what already works for it&apos;s specific purpose.<br/>&gt;Everyone knows what tET means.</p><p>Explicitly or not, tet _does_ mean the division is of the 2:1.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.
