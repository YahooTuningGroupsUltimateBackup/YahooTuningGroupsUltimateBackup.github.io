One question off the top is where is the other 5. maybe it has to with tones in between that each have two options which has been mentioned. In this way i can think of one way the idea could work But i would have to see what exactly the paper being quoted actually says. Bach&apos;s rhythm makes his music logically transposable into anything and is not a good evaluation of much. Perhaps a better point, if we are going to obsess on his tuning is how bad Slendro music sounds in any of the tunings put forth. For Slendro tunings, one might be better to look at Kunst as opposed to wikipedia. I have often thought of Bach as a Lutheran gamelan composer. Lou Harrison , Who was anything but shabby when it came to counterpoint, and a major part of his music, mentioned  he much preferred to write for gamelan cause he had more parts available.

If, in acoustic 12tET<br/>practice or in some keys of a well-temperament, 12-tET is itself<br/>tempered, so to speak, to have thirds of 13/11 and 14/11, ie, sing M<br/>high and m low, this is even more &quot;ET&quot; than ET, in this<br/>respect, in addition to acquiring a consonance of its own a couple<br/>steps up the harmonic series.</p><p>To step back, and to put it all another way, I believe that one<br/>source of Romantic music was the love of the more distant<br/>keys (das Zimmermaedchen and die Schwarze Gredel, for crying out<br/>loud), an idea tied into class and nationalistic warfare of<br/>the late 18th and the 19th centuries.</p><p>If the distant keys were to have been virtually indistinguishable<br/>from the near keys, this would not have happened. The fact<br/>that we have inherited the idea of near and distant keys reflects<br/>more than ordeals of keyboard fingering (the fingers of many<br/>untrained pianists can fall naturally into keys that bristle like<br/>porcupines on paper, cf Irving Berlin and F# Major): it reflects<br/>something that must have once been clearly audible.</p><p>Audible, how? The wide variety of tunings throughout the coupla<br/>centuries preceding the 19th defies the idea that specific<br/>key colors were drilled into everyone&apos;s head by sheer rote. Yet<br/>there must have been some red thread to a vast number of<br/>tunings throughout the Europes, for some length of time, if there is<br/>any merit to the placing of the sound of the &quot;distant<br/>keys&quot; in the geneology of Romanticism.</p><p>I propose that we need look no further than the overtone series to<br/>find an audible and dare I say &quot;natural&quot; red thread in<br/>this case: thirds in the near keys of the well-tempered era focused<br/>on lower partials, and the distant keys on higher. A more<br/>or less infinite number of possible temperaments, in different<br/>places and times, could and I believe did conform to this<br/>general, and audible, idea.</p><p>What are we looking at? Basically 5/4-9/7 and their corresponding<br/>minors, with a real-life realization, all things<br/>considered, which has a range of more or less &quot;5/4 + a little&quot;<br/>to &quot;about-14/11&quot;, with corresponding minors.</p><p>In light of what came after Bach, for example, can we honestly<br/>dismiss a well- temperament because it has Pythagorean or<br/>higher thirds in distant keys? I don&apos;t think so, because whether you<br/>call an 81/64, a 14/11 or even, may I be so bold, a 9/7,<br/>&quot;hard&quot;, &quot;hysterical&quot;, &quot;glaring&quot;, or &quot;bright&quot;, &quot;bold&quot;, &quot;yearning&quot;,<br/>you could hardly deny that those kind of sound values, for<br/>better or worse, are increasingly popular in the music of the<br/>Europes, following the time of Bach.</p><p>The argument that the inclusion of distant keys in Romantic music is<br/>all about modulations won&apos;t fly in my book, bogged down<br/>as it is by things like Wagner dipping the gilded lily into the<br/>laudanum of a single chord for enough time to go out and piss, buy a<br/>beer and come back. No: the keys in the 19th century had distinct<br/>colors, and 12tET wasn&apos;t about dictating a grid for the orchestra,<br/>but about neutrality vis-a-vis what were in practice<br/>pretty extreme thirds and other variations between keys. Once this<br/>neutral-sounding grid (12-tET)was entrenched on the<br/>recently ubiquitous piano, it took on a life of its own, another<br/>story (see Taruskin on Schoenberg for a thought-provoking<br/>look at things).</p><p>So: to dismiss, say, WkIII or whatever on grounds of an 81/64 or<br/>three is, in my opinion, ahistorical, because it completely<br/>disconnects a well-temperament from its future, viewing only its<br/>past, whereas all we who have birthed and buried know that<br/>things are simply not that way.</p><p>I believe that well-temperaments of the 17th and 18th century<br/>weren&apos;t about uniformity, but about a diversity justified by<br/>&quot;nature&quot;. 81/64 wasn&apos;t a crappy 5/4, but a Pythagorean third, the<br/>thirds yet higher weren&apos;t disasterous 5/4s, but decent<br/>14/11s, etc. What may have started out as flaws and byproducts<br/>became desirable features at some point.</p><p>And so I believe that the search for Bach&apos;s temperament should be<br/>focussed on getting as far AWAY from 12-tET as possible,<br/>and that 12-tET is NOT a direct descendant of the WTs of Bach&apos;s<br/>time, rather a whole different compromise based on achieving<br/>as neutral a sound as possible in order to avoid clashing with the<br/>INCREASINGLY wild and &quot;microtonal&quot; colors of the following<br/>centuries, a pallette of colors which developed from the &quot;distant<br/>keys&quot;.</p><p>WTC is not &quot;Giant Steps&quot;. I find it hard to believe that a musician<br/>of Bach&apos;s (pro)creativity would not have written &quot;Giant<br/>Steps&quot; kind of display pieces if his tuning had actually been as<br/>close to 12-tET as Brad Lehman&apos;s is (not that Lehman&apos;s<br/>tuning isn&apos;t an excellent tuning in its own right ).</p><p>I believe that we can speak with some authority about the intonation<br/>of the late 19th century, and that it&apos;s<br/>not a stretch to say that a century ago diatonic thinking,<br/>chromaticism and what would today be called &quot;microtonality&quot;<br/>existed together in a very colorful way, as a norm. I&apos;m not the<br/>oldest here and yet I have &quot;from the horse&apos;s mouth&quot; musical<br/>instruction by people born in the 19th century. THAT world, as far<br/>as I can tell, indicates a decidely non-12tET way of<br/>thinking and hearing, and I believe its tangibly Romantic nature<br/>goes way back. I simply connect &quot;that&quot; with the Baroque by<br/>way of the &quot;distant keys&quot;. If this connection is valid, the &quot;distant<br/>keys&quot; must have been truly &quot;distant&quot;.</p><p>Put yet another way, I know, physically, the third of the<br/>dominant/leading tone-to-tonic as something that is in no way a 5/4,<br/>but suspiciously similar to a 9/7, from five days a week for five<br/>years with a teacher whose professional career was between the wars<br/>and treasured letters from Richard Strauss himself. Rather than<br/>ahistorically imposing sudden leaps into art, I assume evolutions<br/>and permutations, thread this kind of intonation all the way back to<br/>the &quot;distant keys&quot; of Werckmeister et al.</p><p>Anyway, carry on- the religions of 5/4 and 12-tET excommunicate all<br/>I have said above anyway.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=71959 href="#71959">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2007 7:40:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  In 12-ET the diminished 6th is (obviously) 700 cents,<br/>&gt; the same as the 5ths are.<br/>Not at all!</p><p>some 6ths:</p><p>1.Pythagoren (1 200 * ln(27 / 16)) / ln(2) = ~905.865003...Cents<br/>2.syntonic (1 200 * ln(5 / 3)) / ln(2) = ~884.358713...Cents<br/>3.

If the interval is a chromatic-semitone<br/>&gt; larger than perfect or major, it is augmented, and if<br/>&gt; it is a chromatic-semitone smaller than perfect or minor,<br/>&gt; it is diminished.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can use those two rules to find the correct interval<br/>&gt; name for any interval that can be found in standard<br/>&gt; theory. In diatonic tunings, it&apos;s easy enough to<br/>&gt; count the half-steps (both diatonic and chromatic<br/>&gt; semitones) to find the quality -- i have some tables<br/>&gt; on my webpage showing how this works for 12-edo,<br/>&gt; 19-edo, and 31-edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, note that it is not a simple matter to just<br/>&gt; count sharps and flats, because even with the plain<br/>&gt; nominals A B C D E F G, we already have an augmented-4th<br/>&gt; between F:B and a diminished-5th between B:F, without<br/>&gt; any accidentals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an artifact of the logical mistake inherent<br/>&gt; in Western musical notation: that the nominals stand<br/>&gt; for notes of a scale (the heptatonic diatonic scale)<br/>&gt; which has 2 different step sizes. Most of the steps<br/>&gt; are &quot;whole-steps&quot;, and there is no indication in the<br/>&gt; notation where the 2 half-steps (diatonic-semitones)<br/>&gt; are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s too bad it happened that way, and there have been<br/>&gt; many proposals for a logically consistent notation<br/>&gt; system (including several by me).

(unless augmented or diminished)<br/>&gt; &gt; It is the lack thereof: the so called &quot;intervallessness&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; We&apos;ve been through this, haven&apos;t we?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and i disagreed with you every step of the way.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Possibly. What I claim is contraversial.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Prime&quot; is simply the Latin word for &quot;first&quot;, just<br/>&gt; as &quot;octave&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;eighth&quot;. The words<br/>&gt; themselves are no more significant than that. We use<br/>&gt; the English words (or in my case, the abbreviation<br/>&gt; based on the numeral) for all others: 2nd, 3rd, 4th,<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I am aware of that.</p><p>&gt; The word which really means &quot;intervallessness&quot; is<br/>&gt; &quot;unison&quot;, from the Latin for &quot;one sound&quot;. However,<br/>&gt; even this word is usually classified as an interval.<br/>&gt; See, for example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.dolmetsch.com/defsu1.htm">http://www.dolmetsch.com/defsu1.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (a website, BTW, which has frequently lifted material<br/>&gt; out of my Encyclopedia articles ... which is something<br/>&gt; i guess i should be proud of ...?)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Unison is an interval only if it is sounded at the interval of equivalance,<br/>which is the octave by default.</p><p>Is there an audible interval between the tricordi strings of a piano tuned<br/>to a unison?</p><p>&gt; So while musicians ordinarily learn that the interval<br/>&gt; between two sound of the same pitch is a &quot;unison&quot;,<br/>&gt; the situation is really backwards. That term for the<br/>&gt; interval is properly &quot;prime&quot; because of the way it<br/>&gt; fits into the numerical categorization and naming system<br/>&gt; as i outlined above. &quot;Unison&quot; has not other real<br/>&gt; counterpart in music-theory terminology, and thus<br/>&gt; *it* is the term which should be reserved for referring<br/>&gt; to the &quot;intervallessness&quot; of such a sonority.<br/>&gt;</p><p>There is no interval in either the prime or the unison, simple as that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, G-Eb could be considered both a diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; major sixth, and a minor sixth, which would make G#-Eb<br/>&gt; &gt; either a double diminished major sixth or a diminished<br/>&gt; &gt; minor sixth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having missed part of the discussion (mainly because i<br/>&gt; find much of what Andreas posts to be a bit difficult<br/>&gt; to understand, and i haven&apos;t had the proper time to sit<br/>&gt; and ponder what he wrote), i&apos;m guessing that there must<br/>&gt; be some other classification of intervals which allows<br/>&gt; the use of *both* diminished and minor/major in the<br/>&gt; same name. Standard Western theory doesn&apos;t. An interval<br/>&gt; is either one of the three basic sizes (perfect, minor,<br/>&gt; or major), or it is augmented or diminished, or doubly ...<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;</p><p>How do you decide which sixth (major/minor) has the priority?

As Ozan says, it&apos;s nothing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So there, now it sounds like i&apos;m agreeing with Ozan<br/>&gt; after all the arguing i&apos;ve done against what he wrote.<br/>&gt; Shows hows ridiculous the whole thing is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe if we argue long enough and loudly enough,<br/>&gt; we can convince the musical establishment at large<br/>&gt; to switch to the 0th, 1st, 2nd, ... system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>&gt; Tonescape microtonal music software<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p></div><h3><a id=72042 href="#72042">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2007 10:08:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron JOHNSON :-),</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

It makes it an extra hurdle to teach<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; intervals for sure.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Like you said, telling a student that a third plus a third is a fifth,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; when 3+3 != 5, is a pure pain in the @&amp;!. Obviously, it makes more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; sense to update the nomenclature as far as the staff is concerned,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; too: we see an interval &apos;4 steps up&apos; or &apos;4 steps down&apos;, and yet, we<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; call it a &apos;5th&apos;. The other aspect which is crazy is that odd numbers<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; should have the property of reversing the &apos;line or space&apos; condition on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the staff, NOT even numbers. But we notice, by standard nomenclature,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that a &apos;space to space&apos; or a &apos;line to line&apos; interval on the staff is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; always an odd interval, exactly the opposite of what intuition tells<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; us the case should be in a system with two choices: line or space.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; It&apos;s a didactic nightmare, but it also shows us the power of tradition<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that it hasn&apos;t changed, and like you say, probably never will.....<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; -A.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Counting (number theory = natural) numbers are used for diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals. Two pitches are involved. We don&apos;t count them &apos;zero, one&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; So, by your logic, a unison ought to be called a 2nd if we count the<br/>&gt; pitches: &quot;C, C: 1, 2&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; People generally don&apos;t start counting with zero; they count<br/>&gt; &gt; starting with 1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and we can and should, if we were a bit smarter, start at the step<br/>&gt; away from the unison: one step away, two steps away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Interval numbers come from staff distace, which comes<br/>&gt; &gt; from 7 diatonic nominals, which make perfect sense when distances<br/>&gt; &gt; between two points begin by counting 1 at the first point.<br/>&gt; Of course it makes perfect sense when starting from that premise. I just<br/>&gt; think that premise is stupid. Plus, it is mathematically dumb:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5+4=8, 5+5+5=13, 8+2=9 etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...which means we have to learn an extra math algorithm: find the number<br/>&gt; of pitches contributing to the stack, and subtract that number, then add<br/>&gt; one to get the &apos;real&apos; (fake) interval name. As if kids don&apos;t hate math<br/>&gt; enough, in general, we musicians add to the mess by making them learn a<br/>&gt; really pointless exception to their basic and important<br/>&gt; arithmetic skills.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Even though<br/>&gt; &gt; distance isn&apos;t usually measured this way, this isn&apos;t just a distance; it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; a structure within a scale, and the degrees are what are being counted.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Why not have a distance always be measured the way one expects? The<br/>&gt; logic of scale structure still remains, just the names change for clarity.<br/>&gt; Why should scale degree names have to come into play at all?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Explaining why an interval and its inversion add up to 9 is then not<br/>&gt; &gt; really so tough.<br/>&gt; Really, you are right, but for less than perfectly bright students,<br/>&gt; which are rare these days, it is an unnecessary confusion. My students<br/>&gt; are never confused when I ask &quot;How many steps away is this?&quot; or even<br/>&gt; &quot;what interval is this---remember, add 1 to the steps away, or start<br/>&gt; counting at one on the note&quot;, but the more complex things get with<br/>&gt; stacking, the more math exceptions have to be done, and why not make it<br/>&gt; the math they learn in school? It just serves to slow things down, I<br/>&gt; think completely unnecessarily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I *do* however see the counter argument---this is what musicians have<br/>&gt; called things for centuries, and they need to know that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *Sigh*---what a ridiculous race humanity is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  The staff shows pitch height for 7 diatonic naturals.<br/>&gt; &gt; Simple permutations of these 7 tones give 13 tones on the<br/>&gt; &gt; chain which represent all the basic diatonic intervals from the<br/>&gt; &gt; augmented fouth to the diminished fifth, and accidentals are not<br/>&gt; &gt; necessary to show this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This has nothing to do with what Monz or I were saying, but I&apos;m glad<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve taken the course &apos;Staff 101&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -A.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=72045 href="#72045">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@h-pi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2007 10:47:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.

In number theory, the &apos;natural numbers&apos; are the counting<br/>numbers; no need to correct me there, thanks. It isn&apos;t illogical to call a<br/>unison a unison. You guys want to call a unison a &apos;nothing&apos;? Go back to<br/>the beginning. In Western music theory, tones are represented by notes<br/>which potentially become pitches, and because of this an interval<br/>means many things; it exists between two tones (what&apos;s mathematical),<br/>two notes (what&apos;s written), and two pitches (what&apos;s heard). The tones are<br/>too complicated; nobody wants to worry about fractions and big numbers.<br/>The names come from the notes, which is why I worte about the staff earlier,<br/>and we use the same names to identify pitches by ear. An interval distance<br/>corresponds to staff positions spanned. It only secondarily corresponds<br/>to scale steps traversed. Staff positions are counted, 1, 2, 3, etc. If there<br/>is only one position present, then only 1 is counted. Children count starting<br/>with 1, and they get this immediately. Look at the staff, point at the notes,<br/>count positions. Done.

When a distance is<br/>measured with a ruler, if there is no distance, there is nothing<br/>as a result, so the answer is 0. Measuring musical intervals is<br/>not the same, because it&apos;s the &apos;sound&apos; that is the object in<br/>question, and if there is &apos;nothing&apos; then there is no sound. The<br/>two sounds are two points = notes, tones, pitches, in a diatonic<br/>scale. If only one sound is made by the two points, then it&apos;s 1,<br/>&apos;one-sound&apos; uni-sonos = unison, also called the prime - same<br/>thing said in a different way. Easy and it does make sense.</p><p>I like your system using number pairs in parentheses,<br/>but as you say the second number becomes kind<br/>of superfluous, since it is a given that you have to use the lesser<br/>values and then add one to make the results musically correct,<br/>and it isn&apos;t a big deal to ask the reader to remember to add one,<br/>or explain why you are using mod values. In acedemia at least,<br/>mod was used on 12 tones long before 7. I wonder when the<br/>first time modular arithmetic was used on diatonic intervals.<br/>I remember the first time I saw it in a music journal in my youth,<br/>and it wasn&apos;t a big deal to me then. I vaguely recall some authors<br/>putting parenthases around the interval value to show that it was<br/>a mod value and the reader should add one to it. I mean if the<br/>interval was a seventh, it was written (6). I think I recall another<br/>author used a different font for the mod values. Brackets or<br/>something else would also work, I guess the problem there is<br/>that brackets and such already have special mathematical<br/>meanings, but authors always just state at the outset what their<br/>notation means and everything is fine.</p><p>Yours lists of intervals with the steps addition reminds one<br/>of the ancients (Aristoxenous) as well as the moderns (Martin Vogel,<br/>Easley Blackwood).

In number theory, the &apos;natural numbers&apos; are<br/>&gt; &gt; the counting numbers; no need to correct me there, thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wasn&apos;t saying that you made an error concerning<br/>&gt; number theory ... the error was that interval names<br/>&gt; are not the cardinal numbers, which are the counting<br/>&gt; numbers -- they are the ordinal numbers. I think<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a significance to that: the interval names<br/>&gt; do not actually count the steps, they count the pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It isn&apos;t illogical to call a unison a unison.<br/>&gt; &gt; You guys want to call a unison a &apos;nothing&apos;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m simply arguing to Ozan that if he wants a term<br/>&gt; which means &quot;lack of interval&quot;, a good term for that<br/>&gt; is &quot;unison&quot;, which describes the fusing of many sounds<br/>&gt; into one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ozan kept saying that &quot;prime&quot; is not an interval,<br/>&gt; because it describes &quot;lack of interval&quot;, and i countered<br/>&gt; that that is not the case. &quot;Prime&quot; is Latin for &quot;1st&quot;,<br/>&gt; which is an ordinal number just like all the other<br/>&gt; interval names, so therefore it fits perfectly into<br/>&gt; the interval naming system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;snip ...&gt; An interval distance corresponds to staff<br/>&gt; &gt; positions spanned. It only secondarily corresponds to<br/>&gt; &gt; scale steps traversed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, that&apos;s what i just said above. The interval<br/>&gt; names count the notes, not the steps between the notes.<br/>&gt; We moderns *want* them to count the steps, but that&apos;s<br/>&gt; not where the names came from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is really no big deal, because if we want intervals<br/>&gt; which measure the steps we can just use the zero convention<br/>&gt; instead. Sure people naturally begin counting with 1,<br/>&gt; but today all literate people are OK with the idea of<br/>&gt; zero being a number just like all the rest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IMO much more confusion results from the lack of<br/>&gt; distinction between the 2 different step sizes of<br/>&gt; the diatonic scale. I will always support something<br/>&gt; which i think is more logical. One suggestion i read<br/>&gt; about once was to use a pair of integers, one representing<br/>&gt; the number of diatonic steps and the other representing<br/>&gt; the number of 12-edo semitones.

I will always support something<br/>&gt; which i think is more logical. One suggestion i read<br/>&gt; about once was to use a pair of integers, one representing<br/>&gt; the number of diatonic steps and the other representing<br/>&gt; the number of 12-edo semitones. This was a good idea,<br/>&gt; but a bit awkward.</p><p>Using two vals both supporting meantone is always a fine plan, and<br/>this would be an example--Eytan Agmon&apos;s 7-12 system, in fact. But you<br/>can also, for instance, use vals giving octaves and fifths (the 7-12<br/>system can be seen as giving 25/24 and 128/125 steps.)</p><p>The 7-12 system, in other words, uses the pair</p><p>[&lt;7 11 16|, &lt;12 19 28|]</p><p>to get a pair of numbers a and b, and the corresponding interval is<br/>(128/125)^a * (25/24)^b tempered in meantone. Octaves and fifths uses</p><p>[&lt;1 1 0|, &lt;0 1 4|]</p><p>to get a pair of numbers a and b, and the corresponding interval is<br/>2^a (3/2)^b tempered in meantone.</p><p>Charles Lucy likes the 7-5 system instead of the 7-12 system, where<br/>you can count diatonic (from the 7) and chromatic (from the 5)<br/>semitones. This is a good system in terms of its correspondence to<br/>classical meantone notation, though doing the translation is still<br/>nonobvious. 7-et assigns a value of 1 to the diatonic semitone, which<br/>we can call 16/15, and 0 to the chromatic semitone, which we can call<br/>25/24. 5-et assigns a value of 1 to the chromatic semitone, and 0 to<br/>the diatonic semitone.</p><p>It should be noted that to do septimal meantone requires nonpatent<br/>vals. The 7-et should be 19-et - 12-et, and using that, you can get a<br/>5-et which is 12-et - 7-et, or in other words 2*12-et - 19-et. Hence<br/>the Lucy map would be</p><p>[&lt;7 11 16 19|, &lt;5 8 12 15|]</p><p>Hence for example 7/5 gets (3, 3) as a value, the same as 45/32 and<br/>25/18, and three times 9/8 which gets (1, 1). It is therefore a<br/>tritone.</p></div><h3><a id=72069 href="#72069">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2007 1:08:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Klaus Schmirler &lt;KSchmir@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; monz schrieb:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For a minute i didn&apos;t know what he was talking about<br/>&gt; &gt; either.

Two pitches are involved. We don&apos;t<br/>&gt; count them &apos;zero, one&apos;. People generally don&apos;t start<br/>&gt; counting with zero; they count starting with 1. Interval<br/>&gt; numbers come from staff distace, which comes from 7<br/>&gt; diatonic nominals, which make perfect sense when<br/>&gt; distances between two points begin by counting 1 at<br/>&gt; the first point. Even though distance isn&apos;t usually<br/>&gt; measured this way, this isn&apos;t just a distance; it&apos;s<br/>&gt; a structure within a scale, and the degrees are what<br/>&gt; are being counted.</p><p>Mostly, what you wrote here is correct. But actually,<br/>the counting numbers are the cardinal numbers<br/>(1, 2, 3, ...), and i think the dead giveaway with this<br/>situation is that the interval names are *not* cardinal<br/>numbers, but *ordinal* numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...).</p><p>While my argument is against the illogicality of<br/>interval names because they start from 1 instead of 0,<br/>it *is* entirely logical to call the starting pitch<br/>of a distance the &quot;first&quot;. The illogicality comes in<br/>because the interval names count the nominal<br/>(A, B, C, etc.) degree steps, and the starting pitch<br/>is not a step.

My goal in quoting,<br/>translating, and diagramming pseudo-Odo&apos;s _dialogus_<br/>was to pinpoint exactly the moment when the modulo<br/>system was first used with the Roman letters, which<br/>is the standard system of nominals we still use today.</p><p>&quot;Western&quot; music is generally considered to originate<br/>either with the ancient Greeks or with the medieval<br/>Franks. There was a definite break in the theoretical<br/>tradition during the so-called &quot;dark ages&quot; c.500-800 AD.<br/>The music-theory of the Franks which emerges around<br/>800 is clearly different from that of the ancient<br/>Greeks, the last important description of which is<br/>that written by Boethius c.500 AD.</p><p>The ancient Greeks did have two music-notation systems<br/>based on using the alphabet, one &quot;instrumental&quot; and<br/>one &quot;vocal&quot;. The instrumental system seems to be much<br/>older, as many of the symbols resemble Phoenician letters,<br/>whereas the vocal notation is purely from the Greek<br/>alphabet. The vocal notation does not indicate any<br/>equivalence-interval, merely running thru the whole<br/>alphabet from low pitch to high. But the instrumental<br/>notation does use a tick-mark (&apos;) after some of the<br/>symbols to indicate pitches which are an octave higher.<br/>The main source for this is the fragments of a treatise<br/>from Alypius ... this book is from 1891, but it&apos;s freely<br/>available and a good source of a lot of historical info,<br/>and here is an illustration showing the Greek notation:</p><p><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20293/20293-h/20293-h.htm#Page_69">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20293/20293-h/20293-h.htm#Page_69</a></p><p>Boethius also uses these two Greek notations in his<br/>description of the modal system. But he also did<br/>indeed use Roman letters to label the bridge positions<br/>on his division of the monochord, but without any<br/>recognition of an equivalence-interval. His letters<br/>were akin to the way we label points on a diagram<br/>in geometry class, and he used them in conjunction<br/>with the long and complicated Greek note-names.<br/>Boethius used the entire Roman alphabet, and then<br/>when he ran out of letters, started again at the<br/>beginning but doubled each letter: &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;BB&quot;, etc.</p><p>In fact, his system of labeling proceeds thru the<br/>alphabet in the order in which he describes his<br/>divisions, and has nothing at all to do with pitch-height.<br/>But of course the lowest note was labeled &quot;A&quot;.</p><p>A diagram of Boethius&apos;s monochord division is here:<br/><a href="http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS4_07GF.gif">http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS4_07GF.gif</a></p><p>The earliest extant documents of Frankish theory,<br/>coming right after the Carolingian Renaissance, show<br/>theorists trying to figure out a way to classify the<br/>modes being used in Frankish chant, and to reconcile<br/>it with what they knew of ancient Greek theory from<br/>Boethius. The _music enhiriadis_ is one of the most<br/>fascinating documents in the theoretical literature,<br/>and is one of the few books which describes &quot;daseian&quot;<br/>notation, an attempt to notate Frankish music which<br/>only lasted about a century. See:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/daseian.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/d/daseian.aspx</a></p><p>It was Hucbald who c.900 revamped the ancient Greek PIS<br/>(Perfect Immutable System, _systema teleion ametabolon_<br/>in Greek) by moving the &quot;fixed notes&quot; (_hestotes_)<br/>bounding the tetrachords, down a diatonic step, thus<br/>moving the entire system down a step, to make the<br/>finals of the Frankish modes fit into a tetrachord.</p><p>This changed the tone/semitone pattern inside the<br/>tetrachord from s-t-t ascending (for the Greeks it<br/>had actually been t-t-s descending) to t-s-t ascending,<br/>and also had the effect of making the lowest note<br/>a step below &quot;A&quot;. Thus the problem of finding a label<br/>for the new lowest note. Boethius had given both sets<br/>of ancient Greek notation, and Hucbald selected one<br/>from either set (apparently arbitrarily) to create<br/>a simplified notation adapted to the music of his<br/>time. See my old posts on this:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/31040">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/31040</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/62449">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/62449</a></p><p>It was the pseudo-Odo _dialogus_ which finally<br/>simplified the naming scheme to the first seven<br/>letters of the Roman alphabet, including the two<br/>alternate versions of &quot;b&quot; (round and square, to<br/>represent flat and natural respectively) and<br/>recognizing octave-equivalence in the notation.</p><p>As for the rest of your response to me: OK, agreed.<br/>There is not an explicit statement about modulo<br/>arithmetic in musical notation until very recently,<br/>probably mid-1900s.

You&apos;ve pieced things together nicely here.<br/>Repeating octave labels as a basic concept was of course around<br/>in ancient Greece. Boethius&apos;s Enchiriadis is also of course standard<br/>fare, but I&apos;m only familiar with one volume (in German) which<br/>specifically delves into the Dasian notation. You may know that the<br/>Greek writings have been summarized excellently by Andrew<br/>Barker in a two volume set, the second of which deals with<br/>theoretical writings. The hardback was expensive, but I see these<br/>are now available in paperback.

I didn&apos;t mean to seem as if i am<br/>&gt; teaching you a lesson, or anything else condescending.<br/>&gt; It was really meant in a jocular way, because my<br/>&gt; response became so long and involved. Sorry about that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and (2) repeating letters in various octaves is an<br/>&gt; &gt; instance of modular arithmetic, the same way that<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s totally obvious this has been the way things<br/>&gt; &gt; have worked basically since the beginning of Western<br/>&gt; &gt; music,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How true that is, depends on what you consider to be<br/>&gt; the &quot;beginning&quot; of Western music. My goal in quoting,<br/>&gt; translating, and diagramming pseudo-Odo&apos;s _dialogus_<br/>&gt; was to pinpoint exactly the moment when the modulo<br/>&gt; system was first used with the Roman letters, which<br/>&gt; is the standard system of nominals we still use today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Western&quot; music is generally considered to originate<br/>&gt; either with the ancient Greeks or with the medieval<br/>&gt; Franks. There was a definite break in the theoretical<br/>&gt; tradition during the so-called &quot;dark ages&quot; c.500-800 AD.<br/>&gt; The music-theory of the Franks which emerges around<br/>&gt; 800 is clearly different from that of the ancient<br/>&gt; Greeks, the last important description of which is<br/>&gt; that written by Boethius c.500 AD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The ancient Greeks did have two music-notation systems<br/>&gt; based on using the alphabet, one &quot;instrumental&quot; and<br/>&gt; one &quot;vocal&quot;. The instrumental system seems to be much<br/>&gt; older, as many of the symbols resemble Phoenician letters,<br/>&gt; whereas the vocal notation is purely from the Greek<br/>&gt; alphabet. The vocal notation does not indicate any<br/>&gt; equivalence-interval, merely running thru the whole<br/>&gt; alphabet from low pitch to high. But the instrumental<br/>&gt; notation does use a tick-mark (&apos;) after some of the<br/>&gt; symbols to indicate pitches which are an octave higher.<br/>&gt; The main source for this is the fragments of a treatise<br/>&gt; from Alypius ... this book is from 1891, but it&apos;s freely<br/>&gt; available and a good source of a lot of historical info,<br/>&gt; and here is an illustration showing the Greek notation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20293/20293-h/20293-h.htm#Page_69">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20293/20293-h/20293-h.htm#Page_69</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Boethius also uses these two Greek notations in his<br/>&gt; description of the modal system. But he also did<br/>&gt; indeed use Roman letters to label the bridge positions<br/>&gt; on his division of the monochord, but without any<br/>&gt; recognition of an equivalence-interval. His letters<br/>&gt; were akin to the way we label points on a diagram<br/>&gt; in geometry class, and he used them in conjunction<br/>&gt; with the long and complicated Greek note-names.<br/>&gt; Boethius used the entire Roman alphabet, and then<br/>&gt; when he ran out of letters, started again at the<br/>&gt; beginning but doubled each letter: &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;BB&quot;, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, his system of labeling proceeds thru the<br/>&gt; alphabet in the order in which he describes his<br/>&gt; divisions, and has nothing at all to do with pitch-height.<br/>&gt; But of course the lowest note was labeled &quot;A&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A diagram of Boethius&apos;s monochord division is here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS4_07GF.gif">http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/6th-8th/BOEMUS4_07GF.gif</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The earliest extant documents of Frankish theory,<br/>&gt; coming right after the Carolingian Renaissance, show<br/>&gt; theorists trying to figure out a way to classify the<br/>&gt; modes being used in Frankish chant, and to reconcile<br/>&gt; it with what they knew of ancient Greek theory from<br/>&gt; Boethius. The _music enhiriadis_ is one of the most<br/>&gt; fascinating documents in the theoretical literature,<br/>&gt; and is one of the few books which describes &quot;daseian&quot;<br/>&gt; notation, an attempt to notate Frankish music which<br/>&gt; only lasted about a century.

Thus the problem of finding a label<br/>&gt; for the new lowest note. Boethius had given both sets<br/>&gt; of ancient Greek notation, and Hucbald selected one<br/>&gt; from either set (apparently arbitrarily) to create<br/>&gt; a simplified notation adapted to the music of his<br/>&gt; time. See my old posts on this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/31040">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/31040</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/62449">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/62449</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was the pseudo-Odo _dialogus_ which finally<br/>&gt; simplified the naming scheme to the first seven<br/>&gt; letters of the Roman alphabet, including the two<br/>&gt; alternate versions of &quot;b&quot; (round and square, to<br/>&gt; represent flat and natural respectively) and<br/>&gt; recognizing octave-equivalence in the notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the rest of your response to me: OK, agreed.<br/>&gt; There is not an explicit statement about modulo<br/>&gt; arithmetic in musical notation until very recently,<br/>&gt; probably mid-1900s.

Perhaps they were following<br/>Newton, or (more likely, since it appears that Newton<br/>never published his music-theory speculations) perhaps<br/>Newton himself was following an earlier example.</p><p>As Lindley says, the diatonic-semitone is 5 degrees<br/>of 53-edo and the chromatic-semitone is 4 -- these<br/>equate to the 5-limit ratios ratios 16:15 and 135:128.</p><p>As you (Andreas) know, 135:128 is also only a skhisma<br/>(~2 cents) larger than the pythagorean ratio 256:243,<br/>this ratio, however, functions in pythagorean tuning<br/>not as the chromatic-semtione but as the diatonic-semitone<br/>(_limma_).</p><p>This schismatic equivalence is shown in your tables, and<br/>was indeed used in the 1400s. In the late 1800s and early<br/>1900s the tempering-out of the skhisma resulted in the<br/>schismatic temperaments of Helmholtz and Groven respectively,<br/>which exploits this equivalence. But i doubt very much<br/>that Newton around 1700 was thinking in terms of pythagorean<br/>tuning at all. His use of 53 degrees almost certainly<br/>refers to 53-edo, being used as an approximation to<br/>5-limit JI.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=72155 href="#72155">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2007 6:11:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;d like to see Newton&apos;s circular drawing - does<br/>anyone know where one could come by a photocopy of<br/>it?</p><p>BTW, Gene is right that Newton &quot;wrote &apos;612&apos; down<br/>somewhere&quot;.

In my<br/>&gt; opinion,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; however, &quot;53-equal&quot; can be taken a little more<br/>&gt; broadly than what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; we&apos;d strictly call equal today-  77/76 for<br/>&gt; example, found right<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; smack in the middle of what Shaahin would call<br/>&gt; 53-ADO, is<br/>&gt; identical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to a 53-EDO step in practical reality, so we&apos;re<br/>&gt; looking at<br/>&gt; simple<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ways to get what works out to 53-EDO. Therefore,<br/>&gt; even if the<br/>&gt; actual<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; method were rational, even mechanical, the<br/>&gt; result would<br/>&gt; be &quot;equal&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in &quot;real life&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is Newton we are talking about; he was far<br/>&gt; more<br/>&gt; mathematically<br/>&gt; &gt; sophisticated than the average late-17th century<br/>&gt; scholar, and in<br/>&gt; &gt; particular would have no difficulty with 53-equal<br/>&gt; which would<br/>&gt; require<br/>&gt; &gt; him to use a substitute. And where is the evidence<br/>&gt; he did?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t say that Newton had to use a &quot;substitute&quot;,<br/>&gt; nor did I say<br/>&gt; that there&apos;s any evidence he did use a substitute,<br/>&gt; or that there<br/>&gt; needs to be any evidence. Moreover, you&apos;re assuming<br/>&gt; that a rational<br/>&gt; equivalent to an equal division is a &quot;substitute&quot;,<br/>&gt; which it is not<br/>&gt; necessarily.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point is, in the case of 53, it doesn&apos;t matter.<br/>&gt; The point is<br/>&gt; that Newton&apos;s tuning drawing, viewed as 53-equal,<br/>&gt; and other 53<br/>&gt; tunings, could be applied to actual instruments by<br/>&gt; those far less<br/>&gt; sophisticated mathematically than Newton, even<br/>&gt; taught rules-of-thumb<br/>&gt; to craftsmen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suggest that you actually read what I write before<br/>&gt; making<br/>&gt; irrelevant comments.
