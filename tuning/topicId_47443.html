Just having fun here, really.</p><p>I arrived at this in two different directions. The most obvious is its<br/>Pythagorean nature, as the interval 3^359/2^569 is 1.8453 cents (a little<br/>less than a schisma). I also ended up with this temperament by generating a<br/>MIRACLE temperament with a generator of (3/2)^(1/6) ~ 116.9916 cents. It<br/>came out to be an almost-equal 359-tone scale.</p><p>The 3-limit is very precise, but not as much as 665-tone (we ARE dealing<br/>with tiny discrepancies here though). 7-limit is good, and 11-limit is<br/>better. However, 5-limit doesn&apos;t work so well, as 5/4 is close to halfway<br/>between degrees degrees 115 and 116, though favoring the latter. 13-, 17-<br/>limit isn&apos;t any better, but 19-limit is great, just 0.02 cents off of the<br/>nearest 359-tone degree.</p><p>6.4340 steps equals one Didymus comma; 7.0185 steps a Pythagorean comma. A<br/>diaschisma is 5.8495 steps, a minor diesis 12.2834, a septimal comma 8.1565<br/>steps, and an undecimal comma 15.9375.</p><p>Finally, 359 is one off of 360, a superset of 72-equal.</p><p>On the theme of 117-cent MIRACLE, that works out to 400-tet by way of<br/>41-near equal. 116-tone to 300-tet via 31-near equal. So I retract my<br/>referring to 1200-tet (cents) as arbritrary....</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2003 9:35:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t know how useful this would be, but I just &quot;discovered&quot; this<br/>one --<br/>&gt; twice.
