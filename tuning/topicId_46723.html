I found much increased<br/>functionality (in Windows 98) for loading in files.  I no longer had<br/>to use a special utility for that.  Before, it was virtually<br/>impossible to load Scala files in with the interface, a pretty<br/>rudimentary function!  Now it all works well.</p><p>Another rudimentary function that I, personally, use all the time is<br/>the *text copying* possibilities, particularly in discussion.</p><p>I&apos;m finding this new version has this much better implemented,<br/>although it still isn&apos;t possible on Windows just to &quot;right click&quot; and<br/>copy and paste text into the buffer to use with other programs.</p><p>I would seldom want to save to a .txt file, particularly for &quot;off the<br/>cuff&quot; discussions of this or that, but I&apos;m finding that if I<br/>select &quot;edit text&quot; I get *another* underlying dos-looking screen that<br/>pops up and then *that* screen allows me to do a simple right-click<br/>copy and paste.</p><p>So, that&apos;s pretty easy to use in any case, and a vast improvement on<br/>using all the Robert Walter &quot;enhancements&quot; which I, quite frankly,<br/>keep forgetting.</p><p>I noticed a new audio &quot;tetrad&quot; feature which has a graphic that, I<br/>believe, stems from something John Chalmers was doing...</p><p>Otherwise, everything seems to work well, and I&apos;m certain there are<br/>many other enhancements I&apos;ll discover over time.</p><p>Congrats again!!!!</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2003 6:15:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m finding this new version has this much better implemented,<br/>&gt;although it still isn&apos;t possible on Windows just to &quot;right click&quot; and<br/>&gt;copy and paste text into the buffer to use with other programs.</p><p>It is possible, each text entry has a right-click menu to do this.<br/>Only the main window and command line have their own menus.<br/>There&apos;s Paste in the command line menu, copy and cut didn&apos;t seem<br/>too useful there.

For<br/>example, the 11-limit diamond and several other common ratios are<br/>expressed with absolute precision in athenian. Other ratios, and<br/>irrational pitches, are then expressed by reusing symbols, such that<br/>the error is no more than about 3 cents. The Herculean and Olympian JI<br/>notations (still under development) have progressively more symbols<br/>and can therefore notate higher odd-limits and harmonics perfectly,<br/>and have even lower errors for any others.</p><p>Similarly we intend to forge on with notations for certain important<br/>ETs up to at least 612.</p><p>With very few exceptions, the sagittal symbols have the same primary<br/>meaning in all notations, as commas for specific ratios. But users who<br/>don&apos;t care about ratios are free to think of them in terms of specific<br/>fractions of a tone or semitone or specific numbers of steps.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul wrote:<br/>&gt; A word of caution, a large part of the Sagittal notation is<br/>&gt; still under development.

Unfortunately both George Secor and I have been snowed under with<br/>other comittments lately, and while Manuel has done a marvelous job of<br/>implementing Sagittal in Scala, we have not been able to devote the<br/>necessary time to testing it, and understandably Manuel did not want<br/>to delay the release of the other wonderful features. So, I offer my<br/>apologies for the fact that we will have to wait for the next Scala<br/>release for a proper implementation of sagittal.</p><p>Therefore, please don&apos;t judge the sagittal system by what you may see<br/>in the current version of Scala. Most of the notations seem to be<br/>technically correct, but in many cases the chosen alternative is far<br/>from being the preferred value, and we see ugly things like<br/>non-monotonic letter-name sequences on the Chromatic Clavier (which<br/>imply non-monotonic staff positions for a monotonic sequence of<br/>pitches). [&quot;monotonic&quot; means always moving in the same direction or<br/>staying the same, but never going in the opposite direction]</p><p>Also, please don&apos;t judge the sagittal system by any of its attempted<br/>ASCII renderings. We&apos;ve come up with three different ways to do this<br/>and they are all dreadful! (see SET SAGITTAL). The real sagittal<br/>symbols are the graphical ones that you will see in the Chromatic<br/>Clavier and Staff windows.</p><p>Nor do we have anything yet on the sagittal website except a pretty<br/>front page. We have a first draft of a TrueType font that we are going<br/>over, and we are working on educational material to explain the system<br/>and the meaning of the symbols. We are also figuring out how you can<br/>use them in Sibelius and Finale. We will make an announcement on this<br/>list as soon as these are available.</p><p>It has been nearly two years since George first presented his ideas<br/>for sagittal to this list. It has now grown to become a universal<br/>system for microtonal notation, covering all conceivable tunings, but<br/>I am pleased to say that the few symbols that will be used by most<br/>microtonalists (the 11-limit/72-ET set) remain just as simple as they<br/>were when George first presented them.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2003 4:47:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Any plans for a Linux version?</p><p>Certainly, very soon!</p><p>&gt;Carlos</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2003 4:49:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;are these really tetrads or just tetrachords? it would seem to<br/>&gt;require a 3-dimensional graphic to represent tetrad space . . .</p><p>Just tetrachords indeed.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2003 2:10:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carlos,</p><p>The new Intel/Linux version is uploaded now:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/scala-22-pc-linux.tar.bz2">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/scala-22-pc-linux.tar.bz2</a><br/>(3.0 Mb)</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2003 4:01:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Manuel Op de Coul&quot;<br/>&lt;manuel.op.de.coul@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;are these really tetrads or just tetrachords? it would seem to<br/>&gt; &gt;require a 3-dimensional graphic to represent tetrad space . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just tetrachords indeed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel</p><p>so it should be called &quot;tetrachord&quot;, not &quot;tetrad&quot;, in scala . . . you<br/>could of course have a &quot;triad&quot; 2-d applet if you wanted, just restate<br/>the sum of the intervals to be 0 cents instead of 500 cents, one or<br/>two intervals will thus be directed negatively.</p></div><h3>Carlos &#x3C;garciasuarez@ya.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2003 3:27:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you so much,</p><p>Carlos</p><p>On Friday 05 September 2003 23:10, Manuel Op de Coul wrote:<br/>&gt; Carlos,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The new Intel/Linux version is uploaded now:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/scala-22-pc-linux.tar.bz2">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/scala-22-pc-linux.tar.bz2</a><br/>&gt; (3.0 Mb)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
