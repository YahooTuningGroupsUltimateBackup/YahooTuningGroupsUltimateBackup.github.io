However,<br/>&gt; Turkish classical theory, even today, teaches a tuning which conforms<br/>&gt; quite closely to the extended chain of fifths spec -- and most<br/>&gt; Turkish musicians seem to feel that this theory accurately describes<br/>&gt; their practice (more so than even Indian musicians).<br/>&gt;</p><p>And this spiral or chain of fifths is what I have just recorded in the studio<br/>(Ives&apos;s &quot;Universe Symphony&quot;).  I was drenched in this tuning.  Players used<br/>fingering charts and all manner of playing microtonally correct to the<br/>headphones of certain parts already recorded.  The tuning is great for the<br/>rightness that asserts itself in Ives (already demonstrated in the Bozzini<br/>String Quartet&apos;s performance in Montreal of the 2nd String Quartet, and in<br/>the AFMM&apos;s &quot;Unanswered Question.&quot;  This tuning of the Turks may draw from a<br/>53-tone set constituted in theory, but I was emphasizing only that calling<br/>their tuning &quot;53&quot; is misleading because so few of these tones are used.</p><p>In another recent travel lecture (Vancouver New Music), AFMM violist<br/>Anastasia Solberg and I sparred over my disdain of &quot;systems&quot; in lieu of a<br/>1200-tone palette.  Maybe I should just admit to myself and others that I do<br/>in fact have a system.  She believes fully that there must be a system.<br/>Other composers agreed with me, but she may represent the non-composer, as<br/>well as many (maybe a majority) of composers.  It does not seem to be a<br/>popular position to take.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; If they did, they didn&apos;t go in that direction -- medieval Arabic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratios are steadfastly 3-limit.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It may be that the aural differences between different commas only<br/>&gt; added to<br/>&gt; &gt; recognition of its importance AS an interval. In this way, a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; comma might be a different derivation of the same tiny interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes -- and the same thing might have happened in India as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why if they had all the ancient Greek books, or at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least the books or fragments we have today, would they need to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reinvent the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wheel on the comma?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what you mean &quot;reinvent the wheel on the comma&quot;.<br/>&gt; What do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you mean by that?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was referring to being blind to the existence of a major<br/>&gt; discovery and<br/>&gt; &gt; being forced to start from scratch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What major discovery??<br/>&gt;</p><p>The theoretical discovery and publication by Didymus concerning the comma.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard :)</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2001 1:58:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; In a message dated 12/4/01 2:29:54 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>&gt; paul@s... writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In a message dated 12/3/01 6:06:04 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; paul@s... writes:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The medieval Arabic Rast is nearly identical to the modern<br/>&gt; &gt; Turkish<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rast.
