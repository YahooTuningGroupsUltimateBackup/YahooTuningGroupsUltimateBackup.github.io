Cree Fischer&apos;s<br/>book &quot;Piano Tuning&quot; which was first published in 1907.<br/>He discusses temperament and the need for it in the piano.<br/>His thought seems to be fundamentally driven by the belief<br/>that all the 12 notes of the traditional chromatic scale must<br/>work together as flexibly as possible without there being<br/>any conspicuous &quot;howling&quot; combinations.  Also, he believes<br/>in a musical system which everyone can stick to which<br/>will produce music not having glaringly dissonant intervals<br/>or chords.  Although he is a proponent of 12 tone equal<br/>temperament, he clearly believes that at least<br/>for isolated chords or simpler combinations of chords, these<br/>could be tuned more harmoniously not using equal temperment.<br/>At the time he wrote this, although equal temperament had<br/>been universally  or nearly universally adopted in music,<br/>memories of the earlier system(s) had not yet completely<br/>faded out.  His book: &quot;Piano Tuning&quot; is available now as a<br/>Dover book.</p><p>I&apos;ve made a CD of piano music with 38 recordings of pieces<br/>and improvisations performed on a Yamaha upright piano<br/>which was tuned either in a just intonation scheme or in<br/>quarter comma mean tone temperament for most of the<br/>recordings.  The one piece: &quot;Flow Gently, Sweet Afton&quot; is<br/>performed in three different tuning versions: (1) quarter<br/>comma MT temperament; (2) equal temperament; and (3)<br/>sixth comma MT temperament, which is close to being<br/>exactly midway between quarter comma MT temperament<br/>and equal temperament.  I am making the CD available<br/>without charge to anyone on the tuning list who is<br/>seriously interested in hearing it.  If you would like me<br/>to send you the CD, please e-mail me giving me an address<br/>to which to send it.  Please allow me some time to send it.<br/>If I find myself unexpectedly deluged with requests,<br/>(over 100) I&apos;ll have to charge for  costs and it may take<br/>me somewhat longer to get them out.  I would welcome<br/>comments on the CD.  Some who have heard the CD have<br/>been surprised and delighted at the sound of the piano<br/>in the different tunings.</p><p>Dave Hill     <a href="mailto:ascend11@aol.com">ascend11@aol.com</a><br/>La Mesa,  CA</p><p>LESSON 10</p><p>THEORY OF THE TEMPERAMENT</p><p>The instructions given in lessons 8 and 9 cover the subject<br/>of temperament pretty thoroughly in a way, and by them<br/>alone, the student might learn to set a temperament<br/>satisfactorily; but the student who is ambitious and<br/>enthusiastic is not content with a mere knowledge of how<br/>to do a thing; he wants to know why he does it; why certain<br/>causes produce certain effects; why this and that is<br/>necessary, etc.  In the following lessons we set forth a<br/>comprehensive demonstration of the theory of Temperament,<br/>requirements of the correct scale and the essentials of its<br/>mathematics.</p><p>EQUAL TEMPERAMENT. Equal temperament is one in which<br/>the twelve fixed tones of the chromatic scale* are equidistant.<br/>Any chord will be as harmonious in one key as in another.</p><p>* The chromatic scale is a succession of all the half steps in<br/>the compass of one octave.  Counting the octave tone, it<br/>contains thirteen tones, but we speak of twelve, as there<br/>are only twelve which differ in name.</p><p>UNEQUAL TEMPERAMENT. Unequal temperament was practiced<br/>in olden times when music did not wander far from a few keys<br/>which were favored in the tuning.   You will see, presently, how<br/>a temperament could be set in such a way as to favor a certain<br/>key (family of tones) and also those keys which are nearly<br/>related to it; but that in favoring these keys, our scale must be<br/>constructed greatly to the detriment of the &quot;remote&quot; keys.<br/>While a chord or progression of chords would sound extremely<br/>harmonious in the favored keys, they would be so unbalanced in<br/>the remote keys as to render them extremely unpleasant and<br/>almost unfit to be used.  In this day, when piano and organ music<br/>is written and played in all the keys, the unequal temperament<br/>is, of course, out of the question.  But, strange to say, it is only<br/>within the last half century that the system of equal temperament<br/>has been universally adopted, and some tuners, even now, will<br/>try to favor the flat keys because they are used more by the mass<br/>of players who play little but popular music, which is mostly<br/>written in keys having flats in the signature.</p><p>Upon the system table (not included here) you<br/>will notice that the first five tones tuned<br/>(not counting the octaves) are C, G, D, A and E; it being<br/>necessary to go over these fifths before we can make any tests<br/>of the complete major chord or even the major third.  Now,<br/>just for a proof of what has been said about the necessity of<br/>flattening the fifths, try tuning all these fifths perfect.<br/>Tune them so that there are absolutely no waves in any of them<br/>and you will find that, on trying the chord G-C-E, or the major<br/>third C-E, the E will be very much too sharp.  Now, let your E<br/>down until perfect with C, all waves disappearing.  You now have<br/>the most perfect, sweetest harmony in the chord of C (G, C, E)<br/>that can be produced; all its members being absolutely perfect;<br/>not a wave to mar its serene purity.  But, now, upon sounding this<br/>E with the A below it, you will find it so flat that the dissonance is<br/>unbearable.  Try the minor chord of A (A-C-E) and you will hear<br/>the rasping, throbbing beats of the too greatly flattened fifth.</p><p>So, you see, we are confronted with a difficulty.  If we tune our fifths<br/>perfect (in which case our fourths would also be perfect), our<br/>thirds are so sharp that the ear will not tolerate them; and, if we<br/>tune our thirds low enough to banish all beats, our fifths are<br/>intolerably flat.</p><p>The experiment above shows us beautifully the prominent inconsistency<br/>of our scale.  We have demonstrated, that if we tune the members of the<br/>chord of C so as to get absolutely pure harmony, we could not use the<br/>chord of A on account of the flat fifth E, which did duty so perfectly as<br/>third in the chord of C.</p><p>There is but one solution to this problem: Since we cannot tune either<br/>the fifth or third perfect, we must compromise, we must strike the<br/>happy medium.  So we will proceed by a method that will leave our fifths<br/>flatter than perfect, but not so much as to make them at all displeasing,<br/>and that will leave our thirds sharper than perfect, but not intolerably<br/>so.</p><p>*********</p><p>If the instruction thus far is understood and carried out, and the student<br/>can properly tune fifths and octaves, the other intervals will take care<br/>of themselves, and will take their places gracefully in any harmony in<br/>which they are called upon to take part; but if there is a single instance<br/>in which an octave or a fifth is allowed to remain untrue or untempered,<br/>one or more chords will show it up.  It may manifest itself in one chord<br/>only.  A tone may be untrue to our tempered scale, and yet sound<br/>beautifully in certain chords, but there will always be at least one in<br/>which it will &quot;howl&quot;.  For instance, if in the seventh step of our system,<br/>we tune E a little too flat, it sounds all the better when used as third in<br/>the chord of C, as we have shown in the experiment (above).  But, if the<br/>remainder of the temperament is accurate, this E, in the chord in which<br/>E acts as tonic or fundamental, will be found to be too flat, and its<br/>third, G sharp, will demonstrate the fact by sounding too sharp.</p><p>The following suggestions will serve you greatly in testing: When a<br/>third sounds disagreeably sharp, one or more fifths have not been<br/>sufficiently flattened.  While it is true that thirds are tuned sharp,<br/>there is a limit beyond which we cannot go, and this excessive sharpness<br/>of the third is the thing that tuners always listen for.</p><p>The fundamental sounds better to the ear when too sharp.  The reason<br/>for this is the same as has already been explained above; namely, if<br/>the fundamental is too sharp the third will be less sharp to it, and,<br/>therefore, nearer perfect.</p></div><h3><a id=7857 href="#7857">ðŸ”—</a>John Link &#x3C;johnlink@con2.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2000 10:27:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve made a CD of piano music with 38 recordings of pieces<br/>&gt;and improvisations performed on a Yamaha upright piano<br/>&gt;which was tuned either in a just intonation scheme or in<br/>&gt;quarter comma mean tone temperament for most of the<br/>&gt;recordings.
