Well, maybe..but<br/>what if, instead, one of &quot;us&quot; hit the big number...what a surprise, eh?<br/>And why not...there are all sorts of references to microtonal music<br/>popping up here and there, yearly festivals in several cities, and a<br/>surprising number of CD&apos;s floating around. And, the more of us guys that<br/>write articles, produce concerts, record CD&apos;s, and try to pass this<br/>knowledge on to others, the better our chances of success. For example,<br/>I&apos;ve just been listening to some of McLaren&apos;s music, and he has<br/>undertaken some ambitious projects over the years....the music is high<br/>quality, and there&apos;s an awful lot of unusual tunings happening. Yet, he<br/>does it simply, by having access to digital machines that allow both<br/>easy recording environments, and a simple way to press CD&apos;s...anybody<br/>can now be their own record/production company, in effect. I like<br/>that...not only can some truly innovative music now reach lot&apos;s of folks<br/>quite easily, through net access...by doing so, we can help bring down<br/>the large record behemoths, whose unethical domination of artists is<br/>legendary. We really don&apos;t need them anymore.<br/>    So, maybe microtones are poised to be the next big thing, the shit,<br/>so to speak...it would be a riot, wouldn&apos;t it? If we all keep at it, and<br/>produce some compelling art, I think our chances are good. I am looking<br/>forward to hearing more music from the creative minds on this list, as<br/>well as reading more and more about this movement towards new concepts<br/>of tuning, and the instruments that make it possible...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=16732 href="#16732">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2000 9:24:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16719">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16719</a></p><p>    &gt;So, maybe microtones are poised to be the next big thing, the<br/>&gt;shit, so to speak...it would be a riot, wouldn&apos;t it?
