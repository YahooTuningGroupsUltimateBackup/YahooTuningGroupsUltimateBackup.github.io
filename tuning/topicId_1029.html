She told the newspaper<br/>*** it was important to expose children to new things<br/>at the right time. ***</p><p>&grave;&grave;He said he wanted to go into business. If that&apos;s<br/>the case, then drinking and gambling may become<br/>part of his life. I don&apos;t want him to know nothing<br/>else but studying,&apos;&apos; the mother said.</p><p>The qualifying examination puts enormous pressure<br/>on Hong Kong teenagers who have to fight for a<br/>limited number of pre-university places in<br/>government-assisted schools.</p><p>This year, there are just 24,300 places for 49,900<br/>students making the grade. Those who don&apos;t score<br/>high enough have to start looking for jobs, find a<br/>place in costly private schools or go overseas to<br/>study.</p><p>A 16-year-old girl, who apparently could not bear<br/>the pressure, leapt to her death on Tuesday, a day<br/>before the results were released.</p><p>[This poor girl&apos;s parents obviously did not<br/>understand the importance of the Mozart effect:<br/>Kids who play piano, drink and gamble and party<br/>do much better academically and are more creative<br/>than those who don&apos;t. Parents take note!]</p></div>
