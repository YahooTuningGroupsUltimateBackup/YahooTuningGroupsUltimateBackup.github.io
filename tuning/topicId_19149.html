Why not?</p><p>If one likes the result, then that is the only reason one needs for using it.</p><p>Or one can work the other way, and take an already constructed scale,<br/>and see what kind of music evolves out of working with it, and that also<br/>is very interesting.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe&apos;s graphics are nice. They could easily be made into<br/>client side image maps, with links to midi clips for each note.</p><p>I do have plans _eventually_ to help develop some kind of tool for<br/>constructing VRML lattices and trees for musical scales.</p><p>However meanwhile, one can do a lot in 2D with client side image maps.</p><p>They are _really easy_ to make with a suitable tool. You just use the mouse to<br/>draw regions on top of the source image, and type in the url for each one.</p><p>You just use the usual paint type tools for drawing rectangles, polygons and ellipses.</p><p>Here is the example client side image map I posted to the list some time back,<br/>showing the octony:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Octony/Octony.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/Octony/Octony.htm</a></p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_16109.html#16109">/tuning/topicId_16109.html#16109</a></p><p>As for making all the midi clips for the links, one can make a list of file names for them<br/>using the convention 3o2.mid for 3/2 etc, and then ask FTS to read your list of<br/>file names, and make the MIDI clips for them all.</p><p>This is explained in the help, but on looking it over, I see that some of it is not<br/>explained<br/>so well, so the help will be need to be updated.</p><p>----------------------------how its done--------------------------------</p><p>For example, suppose you wanted midi clips for all the notes of the major scale plus 11/8,<br/>you&apos;d make this list of file names:<br/>1.mid<br/>5o4.mid<br/>3o2.mid<br/>11o8.mid<br/>2.mid</p><p>Save the list of file names as the file<br/>MIDI_CLIPS<br/>in a folder.</p><p>Choose New</p><p>Untick cycle tune.</p><p>Select the instrument you want to play into channel 1.</p><p>Set the length of time for each note in the time for one note box, and<br/>the pitch for 1/1 using the Pitch... window.</p><p>Then navigate to the MIDI_CLIPS folder in FTS. and enter #mmc<br/>into the Sustain box.</p><p>FTS will then whir for a while, and you will then find all the midi clips<br/>in the directory.</p><p>For some more details see<br/>FTS | Help | Main Window | Record as you play along | An extra option for<br/>MIDI clips<br/>but I see this help needs some updating - I forgot to say that one needs<br/>to select New, and untick cycle tune first.</p><p>Ask if you need anything explained, and if anything isn&apos;t clear.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>You still have a 2D projection, but when you click on a point in the<br/>lattice, you will be able to hear the note.</p><p>For a fully 3D construction kit, I wonder if anyone has<br/>already done a 3D image map editor in VRML - seems a natural<br/>idea.

I use that scale in FTS in<br/>the New Scale window, for the same reason that you used it, as the<br/>only 7-limit j.i. scale in the SCALA archive. However, I plan to keep<br/>it there, and see no reason to change.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, I wrote some pieces with it too, before Paul Erlich gave me the<br/>knowledge that it was a little, er, &quot;peculiar...&quot;</p><p>&gt; I think the idea of adding text to describe scales in the SCALA<br/>archive is a good idea, and would be interested to read them.</p><p>I was thinking that maybe all we need is a .txt file with the same<br/>name as the SCALA file.  It looks as though Manuel op de Coul might be<br/>amenable to this.  They could actually be in a separate directory,<br/>thereby not &quot;cluttering&quot; up the scales directory which is, of course,<br/>huge as it is....</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For modern scales, I&apos;d first of all be most interested in the<br/>intentions of the original constructor of the scale, and what he/she<br/>had in mind when making it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Certainly it would be great to have this kind of &quot;history&quot; as well. It<br/>definitely could influence the usage of the scales, I believe...</p><p>&gt; Perhaps the text could also be added to as time goes on, with<br/>details of ways the scale has actually been used too, or useful<br/>properties of it that were found later, perhaps not originally<br/>envisioned by the author.</p><p>If this could happen, and people would do it, it would be terrific...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, it seems to me, one can take an already written composition<br/>&gt; and try it out in various tunings, and see what happens. Why not?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, of course... However, from my limited experience it is lots of<br/>times unsatisfactory...  It&apos;s amazing how much even a little change<br/>from the scale a piece was created in can change an entire<br/>composition!</p><p>There are sometimes little &quot;happy accidents&quot; that happen in the<br/>process of composing and if the ear decides to &quot;retain&quot; them, that is,<br/>it seems to me, an important part of the compositional process.  Many<br/>times, of course, little anomalies are intimately wedded to a<br/>particular tuning.</p><p>Or, we could just be like Jackson Pollock in the recent, and very fine<br/>film starring Ed Harris, which is playing right now in NYC Lincoln<br/>Center.</p><p>Pollock had proclaimed &quot;I abhor the accident.&quot;  He was obviously the<br/>master of the &quot;calculated&quot; ink splash!</p><p>&gt; Or one can work the other way, and take an already constructed<br/>scale, and see what kind of music evolves out of working with it, and<br/>that also is very interesting.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This procedure, to my ear, lends itself more to &quot;sound logic...&quot;</p><p>&gt; Pierre Lamothe&apos;s graphics are nice. They could easily be made into<br/>&gt; client side image maps, with links to midi clips for each note.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I was just thinking of something simple, not even wonderfully<br/>&quot;interactive&quot; like your great VRMLs have been.  I was just seeing<br/>Paul&apos;s lattices in color with a bit more depth like, let&apos;s say, Pierre<br/>Lamothe has been doing...</p><p>&gt; I do have plans _eventually_ to help develop some kind of tool for<br/>&gt; constructing VRML lattices and trees for musical scales.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Or even some kind of simple tool for making &quot;construction set&quot; type<br/>lattices with color....  Something EASY that one could pull together<br/>instead of the colorless ascii... for demonstrating scale lattices,<br/>etc...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far, the scenes I&apos;ve made have involved editing the source code<br/>&gt; directly in a VRML text editor, as I have been interested in<br/>learning the language, plus everything I&apos;ve needed to do could be done<br/>&gt; that way without any need to learn the higher level way of doing it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But for most, the higher level approach will be better :-)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Er... agreed.  Some simple, fast method for making colorful lattices,<br/>like a &quot;visual construction set&quot; would be a great asset.  Let&apos;s say<br/>with lines that one could just easily link together... like a Viseo<br/>program or something... and perhaps an automatic place for the ratio.</p><p>Well, this is just dreaming, but sometimes things can come of it...</p><p>__________ ____ _____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
