Anybody using it?</p><p>I found the following info on:<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/micro_af.html">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/micro_af.html</a></p><p>&quot;Be forewarned that many wavetable based synthesizers do not remap the<br/>samples properly when the retuned note is out of the sample range of the<br/>original sample pitch. For instance, on the early Proteus modules if you<br/>retune C4 to a value near C5 in the key tuning table, the instrument plays<br/>the correct pitch but the wrong sample. It still plays the sample created<br/>for the C4 pitch, rather than the correct sample for the C5 pitch. This<br/>creates chipmunk type effects even worse than the normal sampling<br/>transposition.&quot;</p><p>Is this true for the ensoniq MR?  Anybody have experience with this problem?</p><p>Darren</p></div>
