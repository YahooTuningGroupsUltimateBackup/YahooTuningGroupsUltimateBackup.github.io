As x-ray emissions cool the enormous<br/>bubble of intergalactic hot gas, the cluster gradually begins to collapse<br/>unto a large central galaxy. This process not only forms millions of new<br/>stars, but also creates an accretion disk that feeds the black hole at the<br/>core. Once fed, the monster revs up like a motor, transforming rotational<br/>motion into linear motion, and spews forth one unit of gas for every three<br/>it swallows. The jet is launched at the speed of light, punctures the<br/>cluster, and creates hour-glass shaped cavities filled with intense magnetic<br/>fields, protons, and electrons. Blasts of shock-waves are sent therefrom in<br/>every direction which ever so gently halt the &quot;cooling flow&quot;. As though<br/>biting the hand that feeds, the black hole eventually chokes its supply of<br/>gas and goes dormant, until the collapse resumes and the cycle repeats.</p><p>In the Perseus cluster, waves of sound propagate through a medium the<br/>density of which is a few thousand hydrogen atoms per cubic meter with a<br/>speed of 1170 km/s, and produce a pitch that is a B-flat 57 octaves below<br/>middle C.</p><p>Clusters observed to be in possession of similar attributes are Virgo,<br/>Hydra, MS 0735, and others.</p><p>Oz.</p></div>
