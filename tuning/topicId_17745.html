Nothing special happens when the<br/>&gt; cycle is completed.</p><p>Sorry, don&apos;t have anything to back that up. Thought it was true, but on reflection,<br/>don&apos;t know for sure. Feel that I&apos;ve read / heard it - I&apos;ve read a fair number of<br/>books and articles on this subject, but one doesn&apos;t recall what exactly one read where.</p><p>I&apos;ll let you know if I come across it again, whatever it was, or find out more.</p><p>You could be right, certainly don&apos;t know anything special.</p><p>In fact, also, if one observes a number of orbits, one can refine the<br/>calculations even further. Galileo made an early pre-discovery observation<br/>of Neptune when it was passing really close to Jupiter, in the same field.</p><p>Of course, he didn&apos;t know what it was, but noted it down, and observed that<br/>it seemed to change position relative to the fixed stars next time he saw<br/>it. But then he lost it because the only way he had to locate it was in<br/>relation to Jupiter, and it was no longer in the same field of view, so he<br/>never knew what he had seen.</p><p>If we knew how to interpret his drawing, it would give a more<br/>accurate figure for Neptune&apos;s orbit (or would have when the article about<br/>it was published, not sure if still true). Though his observations were<br/>comparatively crude, they were still rather good because of a special method<br/>he used to find the relative separation of the satellites from jupiter<br/>compared to jupiter&apos;s diameter. Good enough to be usefule because of<br/>the longn time-line.</p><p>However it has a kind of dashed line or something on it, and nobody knows<br/>for sure what he meant exactly.  I think there was an article about this observation<br/>in Scientific American a number of years back, and his drawings were published.<br/>(can&apos;t see anything about it on the web except a mention of it with dates here:<br/><a href="http://www.h2g2.com/A386598">http://www.h2g2.com/A386598</a>)</p><p>Maybe it is just a kind of rule of thumb that once a planet or asteroid has<br/>completed an orbit, one has a large enough arc to have a pretty good idea of<br/>its period.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Would make sense for the asteroid belt, where asteroids are cleared out of<br/>&gt; &gt;(some) of the resonances - the Kirkwood gaps,</p><p>&gt; Exactly, and also the material in the rings of Saturn.</p><p>Yes, and these are also kept into very narrow rings as well, by &quot;shepherd satellites&quot;<br/>to either side of the ringlet.</p><p>&gt; Thanks for the links, they&apos;re very informative.</p><p>Good!</p><p>N.b. here is a site I just found which is rather fun: vanished planets, ones that were<br/>thought<br/>to exist, but then found to be a mistake:<br/><a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/hypothet.htm">http://www.solarviews.com/eng/hypothet.htm</a></p><p>Robert.</p></div>
