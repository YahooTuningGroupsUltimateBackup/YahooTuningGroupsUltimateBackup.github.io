I think<br/>that the reason that Chris liked 17-tet so much is partially because<br/>it&apos;s a meantone (well, at least the way he was using it). 19 has the<br/>same features, but doesn&apos;t come with 13-limit harmony - but it still<br/>has plenty of stuff in it as well.</p><p>22-tet is probably the best system to handle higher-limit harmonies<br/>after 15 and 17 and outperforms both of them in terms of accuracy, but<br/>it also forces one into more unfamiliar areas of playing, which means<br/>learning more theory (or in many cases, inventing theory to describe<br/>what you think sounds good). 19 is a good mix of both.</p><p>19 also supports island temperament, which is one of the subgroups<br/>that Gene just wrote about as I was typing this, and has excellent<br/>melodic properties to boot.

Nut intonation.<br/>Fret calculators provide distances from the mathematical position of the nut. However most guitars have a compensated nut which is offset very roughly 1mm towards the bridge to compensate for the tendency of the open string note being flat relative to the fretted notes. See here:</p><p><a href="http://www.doolinguitars.com/intonation/intonation4.html">http://www.doolinguitars.com/intonation/intonation4.html</a></p><p>So you need to find and mark the mathematical position of the nut and measure your fret distances from there. If you know the exact scale length of the guitar, measure half the scale length from the 12th fret and mark that point on the nut.

Neither does common-practice harmonies at all, both approximate 5:6:7 and 16:18:21 very well, both have excellent 9/8&apos;s but not 3/2&apos;s.  Both support the following DE scales: 5L+3s, 2L+5s, and 4L+3s.</p><p>On guitar, 18 and 23 can both be tuned either as a series of flat fourths with one sharp/augmented 4th:</p><p>0-466.7-933.3-200-733.3-0 cents in 18<br/>vs.<br/>0-469.6-939.1-208.7-730.4-0 cents in 23</p><p>Or, as a series of sharp 4ths with one 3rd:</p><p>0-533.3-1066.7-400-666.7-0 cents in 18<br/>vs.<br/>0-521.7-1043.5-365.2-678.2-0 cents in 23</p><p>So chord and scale shapes will be similar in both tunings.</p><p>In 23&apos;s favor, we have higher accuracy (as John as noted--it has the most nearest-to-Just intervals of any EDO below 24), neutral intervals, some reasonable 11 and 13-limit implications (sort of).</p><p>18, however, has simplicity and convenience on its side.  It&apos;s an easy conversion to do because 1/3 of the fret-slots are already cut for you, it&apos;s got 5 fewer notes per octave, it contains 3-EDO, 6-EDO, and 9-EDO, and a lot of what you can do in 23 you can do in 18 with only a bit lower accuracy.  Because it tempers out 50/49 to approximate 7/5 and 10/7 with the same 600-cent interval, it allows for simpler temperaments of 5:6:7 harmonies.</p><p>24, OTOH, is very different.  On the plus side, it&apos;d be a cinch to refret because half the work is already done for you and you can practically eye-ball the new slots.  You get excellent 10:13:15, 6:8:11, 6:9:11, and 8:11:12 chords, good neutral melodic intervals, two really good DE scales/&quot;temperaments&quot; (3L+4s &quot;Mohajira&quot;, 5L+4s &quot;Barbados&quot;), subdivisions into 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 equal parts, standard tuning, and access to a &quot;large&quot; existing repertoire of quarter-tone guitar music.  On the minus side, well, you&apos;re stuck with all the 12-TET intervals, and there&apos;s not as much potential in 24 for doing really new and fresh-sounding stuff.  Also most of the stuff that&apos;s been written in 24 kind of sucks, and it may prove to be the least rewarding.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps I should go really obscure and figure out how to fret for the 12th<br/>&gt; root of Phi.
