Using Dave&apos;s picture,<br/>I see that the pentads (quintads) form a square:</p><p>                 1/1</p><p>             5/3      6/5<br/>               \    /<br/>       10/7      1/1       7/5<br/>               /    \<br/>    5/4     12/7      7/6      8/5<br/>      \    /            \    /<br/>10/9    3/2      7/7      4/3      9/5<br/>      /    \            /   \<br/>    4/3      7/4      8/7      3/2<br/>               \    /<br/>       14/9      1/1      9/7<br/>                /   \<br/>            16/9      9/8</p><p>                 1/1</p><p>which makes a thirteen note scale with the<br/>duplicated 1/1 in the middle and the duplicated<br/>3/2s and 4/3s</p><p>&gt; It is also a square scale in another sense--the qunitads, considered<br/>&gt; as in the cubic lattice of quintads, form a square. They are the<br/>&gt; quintads associated to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [-1 0 0] [0 0 0]<br/>&gt; [-1 -1 -1][0 -1 -1]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The horizontally related (major/minor pairings) and vertically related<br/>&gt; (a fifth apart) qunitads have two notes in common. [-1 0 0] and<br/>&gt; [0 -1 -1] have three notes in common, and [0 0 0] and [-1 -1 -1]<br/>&gt; (inverse to each other) one common note. All of the quintads, in fact,<br/>&gt; contain 1 as a note; this is a consequence of the fact that it is a<br/>&gt; subscale of the 9-limit tonality diamond, which can be described as<br/>&gt; the union of all quintads containing 1.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok so far except that I&apos;m unfamiliar with the [-1 0 0] notation<br/>- which I see gets followed up, so skipping forward:</p><p>&gt; The lattice of tetrads works as follows: [a b c] refers to an otonal<br/>&gt; tetrad if a+b+c is even, then the root of the tetrad is<br/>&gt; r = 3^((-a+b+c)/2) 5^((a-b+c)/2) 7^((a+b-c)/2); the tetrad itself of<br/>&gt; course then is r*[1,3,5,7]. If a+b+c is odd, we have a utonal tetrad.<br/>&gt; The root (not guide tone!) of the tetrad is the root r of the<br/>&gt; corresponding otonal tetrad [a+1 b c], and the tetrad itself of course<br/>&gt; then is r*[1,3,3/5,3/7]. To get pentads, you merely take instead<br/>&gt; r*[1,3,5,7,9] or r*[1,3,3/5,3/7,1/3] instead. Of course the latter no<br/>&gt; longer has much of a claim to having 1 as a root, but that does not<br/>&gt; matter.</p><p>I&apos;m lost here too. Well I could follow through the example<br/>and check that you get unique pentads for each [a b c]<br/>- but there may be many ways of devising such a notation<br/>system - so what is the particular advantages of this<br/>one?</p><p>What is the reason for the 3^((-a+b+c)/2) 5^((a-b+c)/2) 7^((a+b-c)/2<br/>formulae? Perhaps it should be immediately obvious, but<br/>I can&apos;t see it yet anyway.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
