I&apos;m amazed at how good some of us have gotten at<br/>that, but the truth of the matter is that ASCII graphics is fundamentally a<br/>really bad solution to that problem.</p><p>   But there&apos;s an even bigger problem.  We&apos;re talking about music here, and<br/>quite a few people have tried and given up on the tuning list because<br/>there&apos;s just too much talk and not enough actual music.  The ideal medium<br/>for the tuning list would be in HTML so that we can send, not only text,<br/>but also graphics and sound.  Conversing in HTML would let us send more<br/>sophisticated text (lists, italics, etc.) as well.</p><p>   I&apos;m starting to think that it&apos;s time for us to put our money where our<br/>mouths are - or at least those of us who use Netscape or Internet Explorer,<br/>or (presumably) AOL and CompuServe as well - and start sending actual music<br/>and pictures of musical concepts.  I mean, heck, isn&apos;t music what this list<br/>is all about anyway?!  Under Netscape at least, you can, in essence, send a<br/>web page as Email, which in turn means that you can include graphics and<br/>sound with your Email.</p><p>   Here is the best way I can think to administer such a thing, considering<br/>that such messages take a fair amount of space and time to download, and<br/>considering that some of us don&apos;t have HTML capability or even worse, pay<br/>by downloaded Kbyte:<br/>1.  If it&apos;s feasible, start up a second tuning list, perhaps through the<br/>    same &quot;onelist&quot; server, or I could investigate whether my company<br/>    (Motorola) would be interested in providing this as a community<br/>    service.<br/>2.  If you use Netscape, or otherwise can send and receive HTML<br/>    Email, then you&apos;ll want to subscribe to this list.  If not, then don&apos;t<br/>    subscribe.<br/>3.  We should decide also upon some standard formats, in the sense<br/>    of what plug-ins and helper-apps we nominally use with HTML.<br/>    For that I would propose that we, unless it&apos;s necessary, limit<br/>    ourselves to *no* plug-ins.  That is to say, whatever Netscape,<br/>    Internet Explorer, and AOL can view.<br/>4.  I believe that that would mean HTML, GIF and JPEG for<br/>    graphics, and WAV for sound.<br/>5.  Furthermore, to keep download times from going totally bonkers,<br/>    I&apos;d also recommend that we shoot for two other rules:<br/>   a.  For line-diagrams, use GIF, and JPEG for photographic-style<br/>       images.<br/>   b.  Usually anyway, limit WAV sounds to (eek) 8-bit, monaural,<br/>       8KHz-sample-rate.  That may sound drastic, but when we&apos;re<br/>       posting to a lot of people, we have to be very economical.</p><p>   So, waddaya folks think?  Would such a thing even be possible (e.g.,<br/>would a typical list processor barf on HTML or the attachments that form<br/>the graphics and sound)?  If we were to start such a list, would you post<br/>things to it at least occasionally?  Is there an alternative approach?</p><p>   I think it&apos;s probably appropriate to discuss this over the entire list.</p></div><h3><a id=83 href="#83">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/1999 5:51:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think Gary Morrison&apos;s proposals for an HTML list are good.</p><p>However, I have had some bad experiences with send data from my PC to a Mac<br/>or receiving data from a Mac in my PC.

In the sender&apos;s case, s/he has to ftp the page to a web site, figure out what the resulting URL is, and insert it into an Email message.  For the viewer, s/he has to go back on line (I at least read my mail off-line).

That because the volume of messages on that list would be low compared to this existing text-only list, and because digesting HTML may cause it to no longer be interpreted as HTML<br/>(I don&apos;t know;  I&apos;m just guessing).</p></div><h3><a id=124 href="#124">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/1999 5:16:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In hindsight, perhaps I didn&apos;t make clear enough what I meant by &quot;additional&quot; HTML tuning list.  Let me emphasize that what I&apos;m proposing is in fact a separate, supplementary tuning list in addition to this one that you&apos;d subscribe to or not subscribe to, depending on whether your Email program<br/>can view HTML messages, and want to accept the download times for comparatively large messages.</p><p>   The questions clearly are:<br/>1.  Would you be likely to subscribe to this supplementary list?<br/>2.  Would you be likely to post to this supplementary list?<br/>3.  Does anybody know of technical reasons why this would not<br/>    work (e.g., list processors screw around with headers or<br/>    whatever so that HTML mail is no longer interpreted as HTML<br/>    by some popular Email program)?</p></div><h3><a id=127 href="#127">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/1999 9:50:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Having thought about this a bit more, I believe that more extensive files<br/>should be uploaded as webpages rather than send to the entire list. The<br/>entire list could then be sent content descriptions and URLs as is<br/>presently done. If someone would like to sponsor webpages for such files,<br/>that&apos;d be great.</p><p>One main reason for doing it this way is that in many, if not most,<br/>countries, local telephone service is not unlimited with a flat fee as it<br/>is in much of the US.  A subscriber in Germany, for example, must pay<br/>dearly by the minute for net access AND the telephone connection.<br/>Subscribing to a list with large files (i.e. MacLaren&apos;s essays) would be<br/>the equivalent of writing blank checks payable to the phone company.</p><p>Furthermore, subscribers in countries where the telephone service is often<br/>disrupted would be at a serious disadvantage. While a review of the<br/>subscribers&apos; address list shows only a few addresses in countries where<br/>this may be the case, it is worth keeping in mind if we are interested in<br/>maintainly a really international subscription base.</p></div><h3><a id=143 href="#143">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@xxxxx.xxxx.xx.xx</h3><span>1/6/1999 5:26:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message written at 6 Jan 1999 09:58:31 +0000<br/>CC: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a></p><p>In-reply-to: &lt;<a href="mailto:3.0.2.32.19990105111726.00961970@uq.net.au">3.0.2.32.19990105111726.00961970@uq.net.au</a>&gt; (message from Dave<br/>&#x9;Keenan on Tue, 05 Jan 1999 11:17:26 +1000)<br/>References:  &lt;<a href="mailto:3.0.2.32.19990105111726.00961970@uq.net.au">3.0.2.32.19990105111726.00961970@uq.net.au</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Dave&quot; == Dave Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt; writes:</p><p> Dave&gt; Are there a lot of people with email access but no web space?<br/> Dave&gt; Can&apos;t anyone who wants it get free web space from advertisers<br/> Dave&gt; such as <a href="http://Geocities.com">Geocities.com</a> and others?</p><p>That does rather miss the point.

For<br/>many people the time to download those messages would be very small compared<br/>to even a modest web-surfing session.</p><p>   Let me ask you folks this question:  When URLs are cited in tuning-list<br/>messages, how many of you actually &quot;take them up on their offer&quot;?  With a<br/>list, you&apos;ll already have downloaded the sound and pictures, so viewing or<br/>auditing them becomes free rather than having to go back on line and all<br/>that.  Speaking for myself in particular, I suspect that it being &quot;free&quot;<br/>would more than double the percentage of such things I&apos;d actually take<br/>advantage of.</p></div><h3><a id=152 href="#152">ðŸ”—</a>jpff@xxxxx.xxxx.xx.xx</h3><span>1/6/1999 9:28:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Further to my message today I have loaded 1 web page.

I wouldn&apos;t subscribe to such a list because of download-time concerns. However I&apos;d like to know about those HTML messages so I could choose to download some of them. i.e. those that seem like they might be of particular interest to me. This might be 10% of them. So I&apos;d rather people put them on a website and told me about them in the ordinary list, as many already do.</p><p>&gt;   That&apos;s another possibility, but it&apos;s not as convenient as Email.  In the sender&apos;s case, s/he has to ftp the page to a web site, figure out what the resulting URL is, and insert it into an Email message.  For the viewer, s/he has to go back on line (I at least read my mail off-line).  It also<br/>&gt;wouldn&apos;t be quite as easy to comment on particular pieces of text by inserting comments in among the original text, as I am doing now..</p><p>These are good points about convenience. Particularly the one about readers having to go back on line. I read my mail online so I hadn&apos;t considered this. I personally don&apos;t find it very hard to ftp a file and copy and paste a URL. Nor do I find it hard to copy text from my web browser and paste-as-quotation into my email. But I guess it&apos;s convenience vs. reaching a wider audience. Don&apos;t let me stop you.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=165 href="#165">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@texas.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/1999 4:47:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; However I&apos;d like to know about those HTML messages so I could choose to download some of them. i.e. those that seem like they might be of particular interest to me.
