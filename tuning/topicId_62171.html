And then he presents the same temperament again, diddling around with it to get several (or many) equal-beating checkpoints and approximations, allegedly for greater ease for the tuner (which it really isn&apos;t)...and unfortunately wiping out the geometric regularity of 5ths and 3rds along the way.  And then he counts up his PBTs and gets a higher number, and the reader draws an improper red-herring conclusion that this is somehow better.  Fortunately Jorgensen&apos;s second book isn&apos;t organized in that manner, so much.  Maybe somebody suggested to him between the books that it&apos;s not worth such vehement attention?</p><p>A few more remarks on the chaotic phase-shifting on acoustic instruments, now that I&apos;ve had time to catch up a bit with other people&apos;s comments here.</p><p>Proportional beating is [let&apos;s say &quot;almost&quot;] totally worthless on the three &quot;early&quot; keyboard instruments where unequal temperaments matter most anyway.  And it has nothing to do with practicing more diligently, to eliminate a natural feature of expressive musicianship!  A healthy range of variety is a *virtue* in good playing, contributing to the ability to hold a listener&apos;s attention with the music.</p><p>1. On harpsichord, it&apos;s idiomatic to spread chords most of the time.  We spread the attacks slightly for acoustical and musical reasons that have little or nothing to do with any phasing in the temperament, and it&apos;s fundamentally to give a warmer and more vocal overall tone.  One could also bring in the issue of bird-quill plectra (irregular) vs plastic (more regular): the notes don&apos;t necessarily sound exactly the same from one time to the next, individually, and that&apos;s not necessarily a musical drawback!  Carefully graded attacks and releases are our bread-and-butter of expression, with dozens of minute variations in timing, *in addition* to any randomness contributed by the instrument.</p><p>2. On clavichord, pitch of the individual notes is subject to finger pressure variations, plus the possibility of Bebung (vibrato). The whole tuning thing is to some extent guesswork and averaging.</p><p>3. On pipe organ, the pipes don&apos;t speak at the same speeds as they get going and therefore some chords automatically spread themselves (slightly), randomly.  That&apos;s true both for chords and for playing individual notes with multiple stops drawn.  The player on a tracker-action organ can even do some of this *deliberately* for special effect, pressing the keys sometimes more slowly to get more spread, and for a more Furtwanglerian build-up of the tone.</p><p>That plus weather variations.  On two different days, or even an hour apart on the same day, any carefully set-up layout with PBTs will have drifted somewhat, either with the whole instrument going up or down somewhat in pitch, or on some individual notes.  Change the pitch of the whole instrument by (say) 2 Hz, and any internal proportional relationships will already be seriously out of whack, in various regions of the keyboard.</p><p>So, for someone like me (being a specialist in playing these other instruments, and caring almost zero for any electronics) the whole issue of proportionally beating triads is little but impractical theorizing on paper.  Careful counting of the beats or their relationships can help in setting up temperaments accurately, but beyond that the musical application in normal repertoire is something near zero.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=62189 href="#62189">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2005 11:41:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Not that I endorse the proportional-beating business, but there are<br/>one or two remarks arising.</p><p>If one thinks of beats as rhythmic pulsations (which seems to be part<br/>of the proportional-beating philosophy) then it follows fairly<br/>directly that small integer proportionalities ought to be musically<br/>preferable, just as recognizable musical rhythms follow small integer<br/>proportions.</p><p>However, it does *not* follow that all the beats in a chord should be<br/>in sync or in phase. They would in general be syncopated. Perhaps some<br/>of the trouble with the sound sample &apos;A&apos; is that there is no<br/>syncopation and the effect is too plain.</p><p>If you are OK with syncopated rhythms - and particularly if you<br/>consider them an essential part of musical expression - you ought to<br/>be OK with dephased but proportional beats. One cannot in any case<br/>control the phase relationship of an acoustic instrument to the extent<br/>required for all beats to be in phase anyway. Whether the result is<br/>&apos;chaotic&apos; or not... is hardly a question that can be objectively answered.</p><p>One big spanner for proportional beating in organ tuning is the<br/>&apos;drawing together&apos;, which I am surprised Brad did not mention. This<br/>means that each pipe gives a different pitch depending on which other<br/>pipes it is sounding with. In particular major thirds tend to &apos;draw&apos;<br/>towards purity. [Is this true of the Taylor &amp; Boody??] So any beat<br/>rates you calculate on the basis of each pipe&apos;s frequency sounding<br/>alone, are probably quite wrong when two or more are sounding<br/>together. If this effect was taken to extremes an organ might give a<br/>good approximation to adaptive JI!!</p><p>It is, though, just possible that proportional beating might have some<br/>aesthetic effect on the harpsichord, due to two facts: one can easily<br/>retune to obtain various proportional-beating triads if desired; and<br/>the instrument has strong overtones which are virtually exact harmonics.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few more remarks on the chaotic phase-shifting on acoustic<br/>&gt; instruments, now that I&apos;ve had time to catch up a bit with other<br/>&gt; people&apos;s comments here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Proportional beating is [let&apos;s say &quot;almost&quot;] totally worthless on the<br/>&gt; three &quot;early&quot; keyboard instruments where unequal temperaments matter<br/>&gt; most anyway.

In particular major thirds tend to &apos;draw&apos;<br/>&gt; towards purity. [Is this true of the Taylor &amp; Boody??]</p><p>Yes.  I noticed that especially last week while playing BWV 572, the<br/>way the 5-part harmony so often locked in, with full principal chorus<br/>and mixtures.</p><p>I also heard about it recently when another organ-building expert<br/>visited that organ and then had some remarks for me.  He could not<br/>believe that Taylor &amp; Boody had tuned it correctly, because (to him)<br/>the A-flat major triad (he didn&apos;t tell me which octave or what<br/>registration) sounded even &quot;purer&quot; than C major did.  [But the C major<br/>is definitely more nearly pure: C-E 3 schismas sharp, while Ab-C is 8<br/>schismas sharp and E-G# is 10.  Equal would be 7.]  I replied that the<br/>A-flat major is simply a lot better than *his own expectation* as he<br/>usually favors temperaments that have Ab-C 11 schismas sharp.</p><p>Even the E major triad has a startling resonance to it, and that&apos;s the<br/>one we would most expect to be vinegary.</p><p>The major 3rd sizes are at the bottom of the first chart, on this<br/>page:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/math.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/math.html</a><br/>...but that&apos;s of course *without* any pipe-drawing factored into it.</p><p>In my recording there&apos;s a movement in C major played on 4-foot flute<br/>alone, and the drawing is especially noticeable when the C-E major 3rd<br/>is on top of the texture.  Melodically it starts to sound like 1/4<br/>comma meantone at that point, where it&apos;s really set up as 1/6.<br/>Likewise when I&apos;ve played that same movement for fun (not on the<br/>recording), entirely transposed into C# major and then again in Cb<br/>major, it all sounds &quot;pure&quot; but differently so, like an equally<br/>plausible yet distinctive color.</p><p>I believe that effect comes principally from the fact that all the<br/>scales make logical sense melodically, more than any momentary drawing<br/>of individual notes higher or lower.  The temperament refuses to draw<br/>much attention *to itself* as there aren&apos;t any notes that ever stick<br/>out as grossly too high or low, either melodically or harmonically.<br/>It just sounds impossibly &quot;pure&quot;, on that organ, all the time, in all<br/>keys.</p><p>This made such a gentle and un-aggressive effect on my colleague that<br/>he reported being even a little bit disappointed: he had expected<br/>something more outlandishly colorful, overall.  Again (I believe) this<br/>was from bringing in his own expectations from some other more extreme<br/>temperaments (Werckmeister, and various 1/5 comma schemes), and then<br/>being surprised at how gentle and innocuous this is.</p><p>It sounds surprisingly colorful to equal-temperament enthusiasts, and<br/>surprisingly tame (virtually un-noticeable) to unequal-temperament<br/>enthusiasts.  Right down the middle, saying more about the listener&apos;s<br/>expectations than about the actual sound.</p><p>The more interesting comment I got last week was from two people,<br/>separately, who are also frequent listeners to another nearby organ<br/>(Notre Dame University&apos;s) that is in Kirnberger III.  They both said<br/>that the K-III organ makes a thrilling and exciting sound that wears<br/>them out after an hour or so (well yeah, all those Pythagorean major<br/>3rds!), but this one by comparison is so much more mellow and<br/>continually refreshing: they could keep listening to it for much<br/>longer without ever feeling tired.  Both of these instruments are of<br/>comparably excellent craftsmanship, and the rooms are of similar size<br/>and acoustic clarity.  And I would factor out the performer part, too,<br/>because Notre Dame has a much better organist than I am.  When I heard<br/>him play this instrument, in May, I had the same reaction as these two<br/>people who talked to me on Sunday: this organ and its tuning together<br/>simply don&apos;t sound tiring.  Nor is it dull.  The builders just caught<br/>a remarkably good balance, all around.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is, though, just possible that proportional beating might have<br/>some<br/>&gt; aesthetic effect on the harpsichord, due to two facts: one can<br/>easily<br/>&gt; retune to obtain various proportional-beating triads if desired; and<br/>&gt; the instrument has strong overtones which are virtually exact<br/>harmonics.</p><p>Yes, but only for a few seconds, and only at very close distances, i.<br/>e. the player himself/herself seated to play.  I did some<br/>experimentation with this, yesterday and today at three different<br/>harpsichords: set up triads with proportional-beating in them and then<br/>listen to them repeatedly, with the head in different positions above/<br/>below/beside the instrument.  The beat structure sounded qualitatively<br/>different in every position, whether I was trying to hit all the notes<br/>exactly in phase or not.  The listening position itself mattered at<br/>least as much as that.  The simplest illustration is to hit a chord,<br/>and then two seconds later while holding it, drop the head to listen<br/>below the plane of the keyboard...any beating pattern goes away and<br/>it&apos;s just some qualitative tone-color of the whole.  Or vice versa,<br/>start with the head low and then sit up during the chord...suddenly<br/>there are beats.  All of this is probably inconsequential to any non-<br/>playing listener during a performance, of any of the standard<br/>repertoire.  Reminds me of the old viola joke: how is playing viola in<br/>an orchestra like wetting your underwear?  Both are a warm personal<br/>experience that nobody else is aware of as it happens.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=62228 href="#62228">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2005 9:40:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; A few more remarks on the chaotic phase-shifting on acoustic<br/>&gt; instruments, now that I&apos;ve had time to catch up a bit with other<br/>&gt; people&apos;s comments here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Proportional beating is [let&apos;s say &quot;almost&quot;] totally worthless<br/>&gt; on the three &quot;early&quot; keyboard instruments where unequal<br/>&gt; temperaments matter most anyway.</p><p>Why do they matter most there?</p><p>&gt; And it has nothing to do with practicing more diligently, to<br/>&gt; eliminate a natural feature of expressive musicianship!</p><p>Did anybody suggest this?</p><p>&gt; 1.
