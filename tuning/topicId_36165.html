Results are surprising but eventually make<br/>sense. First, I should state that computer analysis is not good at all to<br/>isolate a single voice from a group (it is not possible, contrarily to the<br/>human ear, to focus on a single instrument or singer). Nevertheless, if some<br/>care are taken, and if I know what to look for, it is possible to asses<br/>quite reliably the average pitch, overall pitch pattern. Further, eyeball<br/>examination of spectrum and sonogram is void of any psychoaccoustic effect<br/>affecting (possibly differently) trained or naive ears. &quot;Quite reliably&quot;,<br/>does not mean within 0,01 cent accuracy. I think that a precision is within<br/>5 cents: sometime better when singer are really self assured in stable<br/>unison, occasionally worse, when singers &quot;fiddle around&quot; and the signal is<br/>not stable over long sufficiently long window.</p><p>First remark, as noted by Carl:</p><p>&gt; Indeed, on the first check the piano seems sharp, and not on the second.</p><p>As far as I can see from the initial C3, the piano is around 30-32 cents<br/>sharp. Is it intentional? Is it a the effect of bad  A/D conversion<br/>(sampling frequency slightly below 44100)? I doubt that it has anything to<br/>do with mp3 encoding, but how to be sure?. Anyway, as it is consistent<br/>throughout the recording it has no effect on relative results.</p><p>Another general remark is that every voice entry starts 70-80 cents below: a<br/>sort of micro-portamento that settle after around 100 ms. That is quite<br/>normal for vowel that are not preceded by a consonant and is due to the<br/>build up of the sub-glottal pressure. Those transient part are discarded<br/>from the measures.</p><p>OK boys (and girls!) here we go!</p><p>After the piano C3 cues, bass settle to a stable C3 that is the same as the<br/>piano +- 1cents.</p><p>Soprano entry (after the micro-portamento) reach a rather large third wrt<br/>the initial C3, around 393 cents (+- 5 cents) then goes down to finish at a<br/>more stable value some 7 cents below its initial value. So naturally it is<br/>ends down some 13 cents below piano E4.</p><p>What every body seem to have missed is that while the soprano was getting<br/>down, bass was getting up, moving from 133.3 Hz to around 135.0 Hz some 20<br/>cents up!! The &quot;final&quot; third is very small 365 cents, more than 20 cents<br/>short of 4/5!! seems that soprano and bass missed their rendezvous.</p><p>But at this point, nobody seems to be very self assured and harmonics are<br/>blunt (some &quot;giggling&quot; takes place).</p><p>Then the piano give the E4 and the soprano readjust to a much more precise<br/>value that is the same as the piano +- 2 cents.<br/>In the while, bass goes down again to settle to a very pure 4/5 third around<br/>383 cents (+ 1200 of course) below soprano/piano E4.</p><p>Then the tenor enter and quickly settle to a fairly good fifth around 700<br/>wrt to bass. but to get to this interval, the bass has get down a little<br/>down and finish nearer (some 7 cents above) the piano C3 than in has been<br/>when it was alone with the soprano. In the while, after tenor entry, soprano<br/>raise her pitch by some 5 cents or so. The final chords look very much like<br/>a 12 ET chord, but 5-7 cents sharp wrt the piano (accuracy +-5 cents at<br/>best):</p><p>C3/G3     696<br/>C3/E4     402</p><p>So it is not the soprano which is high, it is all voices in the chord.</p><p>---------------------- that is all for the &quot;facts&quot; ---------------------</p><p>I put &quot;facts&quot; between quotes because I am sure that not everybody will be<br/>convinced, even though I provide fairly large error margins.</p><p>My interpretation (my out-of-the-blue theory) is:</p><p>Before soprano enter, they build up a 12ET mental image of the tenth.

I wish the recording and the<br/>&quot;performance&quot; had been better.

I agree that<br/>it would have little or no effect on the relative results. Unfortunately,<br/>the basses settle on a pitch that is audibly higher than the piano&apos;s C,<br/>making the two &quot;check&quot; pitches (E) somewhat less valid than they should have<br/>been.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another general remark is that every voice entry starts 70-80 cents below: a<br/>&gt; sort of micro-portamento that settle after around 100 ms. That is quite<br/>&gt; normal for vowel that are not preceded by a consonant and is due to the<br/>&gt; build up of the sub-glottal pressure.

Both Bob and I hear the basses settle on pitch<br/>much higher (many cents) than the piano&apos;s initial C. Skipping back and forth<br/>from any later spot in the recording and the initial C verifies this.</p><p>However, skipping around after the basses settle seems to show that the<br/>fundamental pitch holds firmly to a single pitch. There is no &quot;bump&quot; as I<br/>skip.  Whatever changes exist in the fundamental pitch once the basses<br/>settle are imperceptible to my ear.</p><p>Since Paul will be quick to point out the difference between my &quot;ear&quot; and<br/>objective truth, I will request that others do the same check.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Soprano entry (after the micro-portamento) reach a rather large third wrt<br/>&gt; the initial C3, around 393 cents (+- 5 cents) then goes down to finish at a<br/>&gt; more stable value some 7 cents below its initial value. So naturally it is<br/>&gt; ends down some 13 cents below piano E4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What every body seem to have missed is that while the soprano was getting<br/>&gt; down, bass was getting up, moving from 133.3 Hz to around 135.0 Hz some 20<br/>&gt; cents up!! The &quot;final&quot; third is very small 365 cents, more than 20 cents<br/>&gt; short of 4/5!! seems that soprano and bass missed their rendezvous.</p><p>What &quot;everybody&quot; are you referring to? Were there earlier aural judgments on<br/>this besides Bob&apos;s?</p><p>By &quot;short of&quot; do you mean &quot;smaller than&quot;? Yes, it would seem that JI was<br/>missed somewhat by the basses and sopranos. (It still seems strange to me<br/>that the basses moved much from their established pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But at this point, nobody seems to be very self assured and harmonics are<br/>&gt; blunt (some &quot;giggling&quot; takes place).</p><p>Believe me, there is considerable lack of self assurance here. This group<br/>had only sung together for a few classes. In a sense, that was the idea: to<br/>demonstrate that the &quot;high third&quot; effect occurred even among novice ears.<br/>Looks like this recording doesn&apos;t represent that very well. By the same<br/>token, it doesn&apos;t *disprove* the effect either. Since I no longer have a<br/>choir to do a better job. We&apos;re (I&apos;m) hoping Bob will recreate the<br/>experiment using his seasoned singers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the piano give the E4 and the soprano readjust to a much more precise<br/>&gt; value that is the same as the piano +- 2 cents.<br/>&gt; In the while, bass goes down again to settle to a very pure 4/5 third around<br/>&gt; 383 cents (+ 1200 of course) below soprano/piano E4.</p><p>As Carl pointed out, it would have been smarter to have not played the<br/>&quot;check&quot; pitch during the recording, but to add it later for comparison.<br/>Clearly, the singers were influenced by hearing what some of them may have<br/>heard as a &quot;correction&quot; of their pitch. I didn&apos;t instruct the singers to do<br/>anything other than to sing what they felt is the &quot;best&quot; pitch throughout<br/>the exercise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the tenor enter and quickly settle to a fairly good fifth around 700<br/>&gt; wrt to bass. but to get to this interval, the bass has get down a little<br/>&gt; down and finish nearer (some 7 cents above) the piano C3 than in has been<br/>&gt; when it was alone with the soprano. In the while, after tenor entry, soprano<br/>&gt; raise her pitch by some 5 cents or so. The final chords look very much like<br/>&gt; a 12 ET chord, but 5-7 cents sharp wrt the piano (accuracy +-5 cents at<br/>&gt; best):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C3/G3     696<br/>&gt; C3/E4     402<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it is not the soprano which is high, it is all voices in the chord.</p><p>Apparently true, particularly in view of the basses high start. However, if<br/>all the voices are high we have learned very little here about the relative<br/>difference between the dyad third and the triad third. Too bad. Hopefully a<br/>better performance and recording will yield more reliable evidence one way<br/>or the other.</p><p>&gt; ---------------------- that is all for the &quot;facts&quot; ---------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I put &quot;facts&quot; between quotes because I am sure that not everybody will be<br/>&gt; convinced, even though I provide fairly large error margins.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My interpretation (my out-of-the-blue theory) is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before soprano enter, they build up a 12ET mental image of the tenth. That<br/>&gt; is the initial utterance of soprano, then both soprano and bass try to<br/>&gt; readjust to 4/5 but overdone it and missed the point (perhaps they would<br/>&gt; have succeed with some more time to settle).</p><p>Sounds right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then with the help of the piano, soprano get reassured, produced a higher,<br/>&gt; clearer E4 and the bass was able to produce a fairly good  4/5 third.</p><p>&quot;Reassured&quot; in the context of this experiment should unfortunately read<br/>&quot;influenced by.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps the basses as well may have been influenced by hearing the pianos<br/>&quot;check&quot; pitch, although I don&apos;t hear them moving much. The soprano move to<br/>the piano&apos;s pitch is disturbingly audible. Since the basses are already<br/>sharp to the given C, it&apos;s not surprising that this third is closer to 4:5<br/>than to ET.</p><p>By redoing the experiment following Carl&apos;s suggestion to not sound the E<br/>should help in this regard, whether the singers be novice or experienced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Afterward the tenor entered and both tenor and bass quickly adjust to<br/>&gt; produce a good fifth with a root nearer to the piano pitch than it was just<br/>&gt; before, but a little high (7 cents).

In the meantime, I&apos;ll take your word for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Soprano readjusted to 12ET sixth wrt to tenor (who are, I suppose physically<br/>&gt; nearer than bass).</p><p>Yes, they are. Perhaps this factor could be minimized by mixing the singers<br/>next time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW the interpretation still hold even if the soprano and bass produced a<br/>&gt; correct naked tenth at the beginning.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what a &quot;correct&quot; naked tenth is. Do you mean a JI 3:5?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; any comments?</p><p>Thanks again for the effort, Fran&ccedil;ois.

I will make an effort to work out something<br/>illustrative, but remember that I do that as a hobby....</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3><a id=36208 href="#36208">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2002 9:04:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., LAFERRIERE Fran&ccedil;ois &lt;fran<br/>cois.laferriere@c...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The final chords look very much like<br/>&gt; &gt; a 12 ET chord, but 5-7 cents sharp wrt the piano (accuracy +-5<br/>&gt; cents at<br/>&gt; &gt; best):<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C3/G3     696<br/>&gt; &gt; C3/E4     402<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So it is not the soprano which is high, it is all voices in the<br/>&gt; chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi francois, thanks for your good work. as a matter of fact, this<br/>402<br/>&gt; cent interval *does* bespeak the soprano singing a high third,<br/>&gt; according to jerry. the high third, he says, is higher than equal<br/>&gt; temperament, but lower than pythagorean tuning. 402 cents certainly<br/>&gt; qualifies, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>Bob Wendell:<br/>With a margin of error of +-5 cents on both the root and the tenth,<br/>how can we say 2 cents above ET qualifies, Paul? If the root is 5<br/>cents higher than measured and the tenth 5 cents lower, that yields<br/>a 392 cent third which, since dissonance is roughly an exponential<br/>function of pitch deviation from JI, sounds in relation to ET almost<br/>just. I personally doubt it is likely that both measurements were at<br/>these extremes of the stated tolerance, but the final &quot;near just&quot;<br/>tenth I describe in my initial response was brief in the middle and<br/>very brief at the very end. Francois has made it clear that such<br/>brief excursions are outside the scope of his setup to measure,and<br/>even for +-5 cent tolerances require some length of time to measure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Soprano readjusted to 12ET sixth wrt to tenor (who are, I suppose<br/>&gt; physically<br/>&gt; &gt; nearer than bass).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; actually, this sixth is 6 cents sharper than an ET major sixth, by<br/>&gt; the numbers above. well, it sure seems that this example confirms<br/>&gt; jerry&apos;s claim, despite its &apos;giggles&apos;!</p><p>Bob Wendell:<br/>Both this information and my ear find it very hard to buy that, Paul.<br/>First the soprano tenth is slighty sharp tending away from JI from<br/>the outset. This is slight but aurally detectable. Then when the<br/>piano sounds the ET tenth for reference the first time, there is a<br/>very brief excursion of the soprano to the ET third (a naturally<br/>stronger attraction to adjust to a near unison) and then very briefly<br/>beyond it just BEFORE the tenors add the fifth. This eliminates out<br/>of hand any possibility for an adequate demonstration of upward<br/>pressure on the pitch when the tenor part enters.</p><p>In fact, the soprano very briefly moves down in the direction of a JI<br/>relationship to the tenor right after it enters, demonstrating an<br/>initial tendency quite the opposite of the intended purpose of the<br/>demo, but then moves back up. These excursion are brief enough so<br/>they would be difficult to detect within the limitations described by<br/>Francois.</p><p>Briefly at the very end, the bass and tenor have moved far enough up<br/>that even though the soprano remains sharp to the piano tenth, it is<br/>on the bottom side of ET to my ear in terms of the triad formed with<br/>the other voices. First the voice goes sharper each time the piano<br/>sounds the tenth, then moves back toward JI briefly once the tenor is<br/>there. I hear this both upon the initial tenor entry and again later.<br/>There is not a whole lot of steadiness in the soprono voice in the<br/>first place pitch-wise. The relative justness of the final triad I<br/>referred to in my initial post on this demo is at the very end and is<br/>quite brief.</p><p>Further, even if the experiment demonstrated exactly what it purports<br/>to demontrate, the whole thing is ill-conceived, since the basses<br/>have only the initial reference for the root, and then are cut loose<br/>to drift, which they indeed do. Secondly, the piano references the<br/>tenth while they are singing instead of being mixed in later, which<br/>again clearly influences the pitch to the sharp side before the tenor<br/>part enters on the fifth, destroying any possible legitimate<br/>demonstration of the phenomenon as described.</p><p>All these points considered, I can&apos;t possibly see how anyone can<br/>legitimately conclude on the basis of Francois&apos;s information that<br/>this demo in any way serves its stated intention.</p><p>&gt; thanks again francois for spending the hours necessary to do this<br/>&gt; analysis.</p><p>Bob:<br/>Yes, thank you, Francois, for what I know must have been a valiant<br/>effort.
