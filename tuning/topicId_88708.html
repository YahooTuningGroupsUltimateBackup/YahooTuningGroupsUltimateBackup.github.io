It clearly mixes up &quot;missing fundamental&quot; and difference tones from the beginning.<br/>It doesn&apos;t mention nor explains either 1st order /2nd order / 3rd order difference tones.<br/>It does&apos;nt mentions double-ocarinas, which provide the most efficient initiation ;)<br/>What&apos;s cool is that it has a link to a page on a &quot;Difference Tone Training&quot; method, very complete, but using speakers (and repeating the usual old belief that difference tones occur at fairly high volumes, which is wrong).<br/>Then it says something surprising, that Max Mathews and John Pierce wrote that &quot;Heinz Bohlen proposed what is now known as the B-P scale on the basis of combination tones&quot;. But what combination tones and on what basis ? that&apos;s interesting but rather strange because it is easy to demonstrate that the BP intervals, wether in addition or soustraction, introduces octaves (but why not, they would be the &quot;missing octaves&quot; then).<br/>It has, on the other hand, much more complete information on &quot;Binaural beats&quot; :<br/>&quot;For a time it was thought that the inner ear was solely responsible whenever a sum or difference tone was heard. However, experiments show evidence that even when using headphones providing a single pure tone to each ear separately, listeners may still hear a difference tone. Since the peculiar, non-linear physics of the ear doesn&apos;t come into play in this case, it is thought that this must be a separate, neural phenomenon.&quot;</p><p>About difference tones/harmonic beating :<br/>We can say that the (harmonic) beating of a tempered dyad is the 1st order difference tone of their concordant harmonics.<br/>But another difference is in the range : a beat, passed 20hz becomes a tone ; and a difference tone below 20hz becomes an infra-sound and a beat.<br/>So again my subsidiary question :<br/>We have a meantone with a fifth ratio of  1.4959535062432 (697.2784049 c.).<br/>What&apos;s the frequency of the beat you hear in a major third tuned in 1/1 = 440hz ?<br/>And more important, how you find it ?<br/>Nobody can answer ?<br/>- - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=88710 href="#88710">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 10:10:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So again my subsidiary question :<br/>&gt; We have a meantone with a fifth ratio of  1.4959535062432<br/>&gt; (697.2784049 c.).<br/>&gt; What&apos;s the frequency of the beat you hear in a major third tuned in<br/>&gt; 1/1 = 440hz ?<br/>&gt; And more important, how you find it ?<br/>&gt; Nobody can answer ?<br/>&gt; - - - - - - - - - -<br/>&gt; Jacques<br/>&gt;</p><p>In a major third diad, the fourth partial of the higher tone will beat against the the fifth partial of the lower.

Cameron has a excuse because his was in Portugal just before his concert (Wow, he is singing now !) and he didn&apos;t read well that 1/1 was 440 hz, not 100 hz (but why choosing 440 hz ?).</p><p>Now remember, the fifth A:E of the same meantone was beating at<br/>(3 * 440 hz) -  (2 * 658.219542747 hz) = 3.5609145 hz =<br/>same frequency ! = this is what we mean by &quot;equal-beating&quot; (here between the fifth and the major third beatings, but it could be other intervals).<br/>So now you can check it with a plain sawtooth waveform and a multitrack, because harmonic beatings ARE completely audible (and you can also see them on the signal), and experience how it feels with the triad A : C# : E (you can also imagine it would be simpler to tune if you were an harpsichord tuner).</p><p>OK, one more thing and I have finished : calculate the difference tone between 2A (A at the higher octave), and C# :<br/>880 - 550.8902286265 = 329.1097713735 hz = E/2 (E at the lower octave)<br/>And hear it, if you can rather with sinus sounds. So this is a simple example (Skisni meantone) of how the two phenomenas, difference tones and harmonic beating, while operating in very different domains of audition, are in fact, in recurrent sequences completely connected.<br/>What&apos;s the significance of that ? If you can hear it, it is significant. But if YOU can&apos;t hear it, it does not mean it&apos;s not significant. Not all singers hear their harmonics, but all of them produce harmonics with their voices.<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=88742 href="#88742">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2010 6:23:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jacques.dudon&quot; &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Now remember, the fifth A:E of the same meantone was beating at<br/>&gt; (3 * 440 hz) -  (2 * 658.219542747 hz) = 3.5609145 hz =<br/>&gt; same frequency ! = this is what we mean by &quot;equal-beating&quot; (here between the fifth and the major third beatings, but it could be other intervals).</p><p>If f is the fifth and t the major third of a major triad in close root position, then (6t-5f)/(4t-5) is what I&apos;ve saddled with the moniker &quot;brat&quot;, from Beat RATio.

Since you&apos;re so enthused about &quot;ordinaire&quot; temperaments, could you try this new tuning and let me know whether those two triads are acceptable.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=88906 href="#88906">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2010 6:21:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also observed that the brat number for a tempered root-position major triad can be calculated by dividing the beat rate of the minor 3rd by the beat rate of the major 3rd, and I&apos;ve found the same calculation to be useful for minor triad brats.

In order to get &gt; exact proportional beating for both major &amp; minor triads, you need &gt; a rational temperament, for example, the following tones in a chain &gt; of 5ths,<br/>&gt; F = 631/472, C=1/1, G=353/236, D=66/59, A=395/236, E=591/472, &gt; B=221/118,<br/>&gt; will have all 3 major triads with brats = 4, exactly.
