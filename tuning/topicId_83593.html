Just like you were doing, correctly, with the golden section.</p><p>Using ^ in this case may be throwing you off, using .5 (divide by two): what you are actually doing is taking the arithmetic mean of 2 figures, one of which is zero, then taking the arithmetic mean of that, then of that... 1 divided by 2, add that to one: 1 divided by 2, divided by two, add to one: 1 divided by 2, divided by 2, divided by 2, add to one: and so one.</p><p>Do it long hand and you&apos;ll see that you&apos;re taking successive arithmetic means of the octave.</p><p>Then you made a jump into straight old JI manipulations- took the arithmetic mean of 9/8 and 1/1 and subtracted it from 3/2, and so on.</p><p>There&apos;s certainly nothing wrong with all this of course.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; And, quite frankly, it baffles me why so many people make JI so &gt;complicated (tonality diamonds and periodicity blocks anyone?) when &gt;so much of it can be summed up in an ancient formula which seems to &gt;produce the most beautiful JI scales I&apos;ve ever heard.</p><p>Tonalities diamonds are incredibly simple- they&apos;re basically just spelling out the harmonic series in a row, so to speak. Periodicity blocks are also really simple, and even their use in tempering schemes is actually extremely simple, in concept if not always in practice.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; And, also to note...those scales don&apos;t intersect the octave or &gt;get near<br/>&gt;  it but do intersect (3/2)^x (the octave/2-tave)...yet they don&apos;t &gt;sound off-center the way many non-octave based scales do.&nbsp; Weird eh?</p><p>Successive arithmetic means of 3/2 and 1/1, then using 3/2 as the interval of repetition? It will sound good, you should make a whole bunch of music with it and see if that fills all your musical needs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Or, dare I ask, is the fact that I&apos;m taking the half/octave &gt;equivalent of unmodified successive golden sections (but with 0.5 &gt;not 0.618) responsible for this (I know you commented before that &gt;was &gt;actually perhaps the one truly original thing in my PHI scale &gt;that &gt;wasn&apos;t well documented in history)?</p><p>Taking successive golden sections and simply calling that a scale, I think that&apos;s an original idea, and it sounds great. The actual material, the successive golden sections themselves, that&apos;s not new at all. If you would go over the replies you&apos;ve recieved here, put things into Scala and examine them, google around a lot, you&apos;ll find just how much phi has been used.</p><p>Phi+1 as the &quot;octave&quot; in 1654!

The actual<br/>material, the successive golden sections themselves, that&apos;s not new at<br/>all.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Agreed...it&apos;s a new application of an age old idea.&nbsp; Like I said before...I got the idea from taking Golden-sections within a scale to best mimic the way they are used in architecture (and have been for thousands of years).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Phi+1 as the &quot;octave&quot; in 1654! That should tell you something. Didn&apos;t<br/>you notice that Jacques&apos; tunings include your scale and tons of others?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen many of Jacques&apos; tunings include parts of my scale or super-sets of my scale (IE my scale plus many extra tones)...but never only successive golden sections.&nbsp; That seems to be a consistent pattern among PHI scales I&apos;ve read, they include interval within successive golden sections such as est. 1.38 and 1.23...but also include a bunch of ratios in no way related to them (so far as I can see) such as 1.309 which, IMVHO, is many cases sound exponentially more dissonant.</p><p>Me&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One real test I&apos;ve been meaning to try out is to take<br/>&gt;instruments with a &quot;perfect&quot; PHI timbre using the golden ratio&quot;</p><p>Cameron&gt;&quot;Arrrrgggg... . you should pay attention when people write replies to<br/>you, check out what they&apos;ve been doing, in some cases for decades....&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Well...to do that obviously is going to take more than reading material; I was considering the re-test in order to get sound samples of things like a successive golden section scale combined with PHI timbres.&nbsp; In general...remember that no matter how many beautiful equations I see I won&apos;t consider a comparison between any two scales final until I listen to sound samples and try composing with the two.</p><p>&nbsp; If you have any sound samples of such as experiment, though, I&apos;m always up for good links.</p><p>Me&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But, as for accepting harmonic timbres well, I think it is fair<br/>&gt;to say the arithmetic mean scale wins the contest hands down. &quot;</p><p>Cameron&gt;&quot;Maybe you like it best at this point, but there&apos;s a lot more out there. &quot;<br/>&nbsp;I&apos;m always on the hunt...if there are any SCALA files in particular you&apos;d recommend please feel free to send them my way.&nbsp; Fact is I find my way around most efficiently by actually composing with scales vs. reading huge papers about them...though I usually end up doing the latter to supplement the compositional experience.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I guess most people who are knowledgable about JI are just going to be<br/>wondering why you&apos;re stopping at such a tiny subset of it.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...if you octave-reverse all the interval the same way Lorne Temes did with his scales, you can easily get 10+ tone per octave scales.<br/>&nbsp; From what I&apos;ve heard so far, taking successive &quot;golden sections&quot; using 0.5 simply gives a list of tones which all work well together, as opposed to diatonic JI, for example, where only certain sets of tones (IE triads) are optimized.<br/>&nbsp; So, apparently, it takes a very optimized subset of JI that, according to my ears, combines 5-limit (or better) consonance despite having 8+ notes per octave (it seems to win on both accounts rather than compromise between high note # vs. good consonance).&nbsp; And, of course, the ability to &quot;have the entire scale be the chord&quot; greatly reduces the amount of music theory needed to play the scale and enhances general ease of adoption of the scale by both existing and new musicians.</p><p>&nbsp; So far I haven&apos;t heard a JI scale which provides the same level of optimization...but if someone would like to show me some I would be happy to try them.</p><p>Cameron&gt;&quot;The harmonic mean is fantastic, and it can also be used in at least one<br/>way I&apos;ve never seen mentioned in any tuning or music theoretical<br/>writing, ever. :-)&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; You see...it&apos;s a weird battle that way: open-mindedness makes a huge difference (case in point that these scales I&apos;ve come across are actually quite simple but, at the same time, seem to be running across a lot of lesser-known historic theories that have a lot of potential and definitely deserve some &apos;resurrection&apos;).&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being, I know a lot of this stuff is far from original, minus the fact I dared to take &apos;odd routes&apos; in experimentation and ended up uncovering a lot of lost treasure.&nbsp; So the real original concept seems not to be advanced scale creation but plain old open-mindedness and curiosity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am far too much of the micro-tonal world seems anything but open-minded: so caught up in Pythagorean tuning and everything that has stemmed from it that many of them stopped looking for other explanations or other possible solutions.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp; So I hope more people will turn to the idea of &quot;creating their own methods&quot;, particular using inspiration from patterns other &quot;un-related&quot; arts and sciences.<br/>&nbsp; True, much if not most of the time they will run into something already made somewhere (perhaps deep) in history but not well known about...but at least then they can make the point, as we seem to be doing now, of saying &quot;look at this...we really should tap into this and try to improve it&quot;.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=83629 href="#83629">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2009 3:51:55 PM</span><button style="float: right;

If I was &quot;teaching&quot; I would have said something like &quot;you need to learn about...You see...&quot; before saying &quot;there exists&quot;.&nbsp; Anyhow, I don&apos;t care about this who teaches who crap...of course this is a tuning forum not a music class; the gist of what I said is &quot;I realize this exists...even though you might not realize I do&quot;.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to what I said before...I realize there is no 1.309 in my scale but there is a resulting 1.309 interval between 1.618034.&nbsp;

I have enough difficulty explaining the golden-section-from-the-root scale I ran across without your telling me what it is.&nbsp; In a previous post you actually stated &quot;Mike&apos;s PHI scale&quot; (and &gt;not&lt; a mode of the scale or anything that may imply 1.309) as having 1.309 relative to the root...and for all the efforts I have made to clarify how the scale is derived you bet I resent that!</p><p>&gt;&quot;And it&apos;s right there in a dense setting exactly as you&apos;ve been trying to avoid in your orignial &quot;phiave&quot;. &quot;</p><p>&nbsp; I lost you there.&nbsp; The only 1.309 interval I&apos;ve found within the first phi-tave and 1.23.&nbsp; Even if you cross the octave to 1.09*PHI and 1.145*PHI notice 1.145 / 1.309 = about 1.38 (which is a note in the scale)....but even then the nearest notes are 1.23 and 1.54...not exactly a dense setting in the same way that 1.23 (1.309 away from 1.618) is between 1.14 and 1.38...again, not in a dense setting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So what&apos;s your main example that somehow proves even using the scale (approximated)<br/>1<br/>1.09<br/>1.145<br/>1.23<br/>1.38<br/>1.54<br/>......that I somehow end up with a 1.309 interval landing me in a dense area between tones?&nbsp;

my scale does not include any other notes than the ones above and fits the (1/PHI)^x + 1 formula and its reverse perfectly (which is what makes it different than other larger scales like the one you posted which include it)!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

entirely since the scale apparently does not include all possible &quot;golden sections&quot;?&nbsp; It seems however I display it or what terms I use I piss someone off...it kind of makes me wonder how taking other people&apos;s advice often only gets me into even more controversy rather than less!!<br/>--&lt;</p><p>&gt;&quot;On the contrary, you should explain the reason to bring your &quot;1.532&quot;

(note : P = (5 - sqrt of 5) /2 and J = Phi^5 - 10)&quot;<br/>Michael&gt; Sounds good...the only part that escapes me is...what is F?</p><p>Each of those is an infinite Phi series, wether in real fractal<br/>ratios or in series of whole numbers.<br/>F is the &quot;1/1&quot; of the Phi series and this letter is commonly used in<br/>reference to the Fibonacci series,<br/>1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55,<br/>that contains here f = 8, but it&apos;s only a co&iuml;ncidence.<br/>BTW I just made up the series &quot;J&quot; here because it is a &quot;prime&quot;<br/>series, that is needed by 1.09017 :<br/>1   4  5  9  14  23  37  60  97 ...<br/>(If anyone has heard of specific names for other series than F &amp; P or<br/>L,  I am interested).<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=83717 href="#83717">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2009 4:23:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacques&gt;&quot;But<br/>one day you say your interval is 1.618034 / 1.055728, the next day it<br/>is (1.618 - 1,09017 +1) (&quot;taking the series in reverse&quot; ) -&nbsp;and<br/>alternatively - makes it hard to&nbsp;follow !&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agreed, I&apos;ve changed the definition of the scale once...but the basic pattern has every tone except the one tone around 1.5278 in common.&nbsp; You&apos;ll notice that taking 1.618034 / 1.055728 and 1.618 - 1,09017 +1 yield almost exactly the same value within a few cents...it is really up to the composer which one they want to use (since they sound just about exactly the same).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Especially when you claim that your scale is based on &quot;only<br/>successive golden sections&quot; : I asked you how &quot;1,532&quot; (or 1.532624) had<br/>this property, but I had no answer.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; True, it&apos;s an exception to the other tones and an &quot;extra&quot; note, as I said before.&nbsp; But it is basically just a golden section going in the opposite direction.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Actually it does means more than 58/55, 60/55, etc. - it means a scale with no specific 1/1.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I need to clarify that.&nbsp; In practical usage you must choose between 60/55 (about 1.09) and 58/55 (about 1.055)...but never both at once.&nbsp; That way, when compared to 63/55...all possible ratios are 1.05 or greater (both 58/55 and 60/55 are further than 1.05 from the next tone of 63/55).&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&quot;BTW I just made up the series &quot;J&quot; here because it is a &quot;prime&quot; series, that is needed by 1.09017 :1   4  5  9  14  23  37  60  97 ...&quot;<br/>Ah, ok, thank you...now I understand.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=83719 href="#83719">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2009 3:18:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacques~ the series where you start<br/>1 1 3 4 7 11 18......... is called the Lucas series. This is the only other one i know that has a name. That recurrent sequences have no 1/1 is an important point and also one can seed these formulas with any ratios one wants ( actually one could feed them with anything and they will converge.<br/>I have always found the numerical series more to my liking because on limited acoustic instruments it give subtle but meaningful differences between the same scale over different tones. What and where one chooses becomes an &apos;artistic choice&apos;. I tend to like to have the high end of my scale very converged with working back down into the range in which it is still &apos;becoming&apos;. With Wilson&apos;s Mt. Meru scales i never start with the seeds of 1&apos;s and go up to where one is at least in &apos;a ballpark&apos; of where the interval is heading.<br/>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p></div>
