But in the worse<br/>case I can write more about myself and my work if somebody is<br/>interested which I doubt. In the meantime you are welcome to visit my<br/>web pages and eventually listen to some of my music crimes (some of<br/>them microintervallic):</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/forrotronics">www.soundclick.com/forrotronics</a><br/><a href="http://daikichi.p-kit.com">daikichi.p-kit.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.forrotronics.cz">www.forrotronics.cz</a></p><p>As a person who<br/>- is Czech origin<br/>- is a founder and chairman of Czech Society for Microintervallic<br/>Music (I don&apos;t like a term &quot;microtonal&quot;, &quot;microtonality&quot; as it evokes<br/>&quot;small tonality&quot;, in Czech language we use &quot;mikrointerval&quot; =<br/>&quot;microinterval&quot;)</p><p>of course I know something about the facts you have written. You are<br/>pretty well informed about lot of things, maybe just a few additional<br/>facts from my side.</p><p>First I would say there is internationally renowned term &quot;Haba<br/>School&quot;, which doesn&apos;t mean at all &quot;microintervallic music&quot; school.<br/>Haba was excellent and influential teacher with very wide knowledge,<br/>open to all new ideas. His lessons were more like a seminar, lectures<br/>widely oriented on experimental acoustics, analysis of &quot;Oriental&quot;<br/>music, (in those times Czech terminology Turkey, Near East, Arabia,<br/>Egypt, North African countries, and maybe more to the East), role of<br/>music in society etc. - nobody did those times anything similar.<br/>Haba was a lecturer at Prague Conservatory since 1923, since 1924 he<br/>started his course of quartertone music, opened for everybody who was<br/>interested! He became officially Professor since 1934 and &quot;Departmentof Quartertone and Sixthtone Music&quot; (not microtonal as you wrote, OK,<br/>you didn&apos;t quoted anything, it&apos;s just a translation) was established.<br/>First those times AFAIK term &quot;microtonal&quot; was not used, second he<br/>probably wanted to attract foreign students from &quot;oriental&quot; countries<br/>using relatively known terms. Haba and his students even took part<br/>and have been demonstrating quartertone music for about sixth month<br/>period at the very first (and for longer time the last one) Frankfurt<br/>Music Fair in 1927 and some students (I think mainly Miroslav Ponc)<br/>have been demonstrating &quot;quartertone music&quot; in lectures and concerts<br/>with success, and public was attracted. I&apos;m not sure if they were<br/>there because Haba was those times internationally renowned, or if<br/>his good fame came after this event. But probably thanks to this<br/>event Haba got some foreign students...</p><p>Many of Haba students just visited his lessons for inspiration, they<br/>didn&apos;t compose microintervallic works at all. Classes continued even<br/>during German occupation 1939-1945, but principially they couldn&apos;t<br/>work fully as official German propaganda those times considered all<br/>experimental music to be &quot;entartete Art&quot; (perverse art) and similar<br/>music was officially prohibited as well as &quot;inferior nigger&apos;s jazz&quot;.</p><p>Now I haven&apos;t here at my hand a book about Haba written by Brno<br/>musicologist Jiri Vyslouzil for quoting more details, but foreign<br/>students as you write were by names from former Yugoslavian Kingdom<br/>(Slovenia, Serbia... there were more: Maric, Vuckovic, Ristic...),Bulgaria (Iliev studied with him after WW II, another student was V.<br/>A. Bozinov), Turkey (Mr. Ozan, do you know somehing about?),<br/>Kacinskas was Lithuanian, Wiesmayer was British violinist. AFAIK<br/>nobody of them composed microintervallic music in big numbers, and as<br/>their main compositional method. To my surprise many of them wrote<br/>very conventional music, or neoclassical... They took it just as an<br/>additional course. My theory is somehow those times maybe probably<br/>they considered it fashionable, somehow they felt they are &quot;in&quot;.<br/>Maybe. Or they just like to visit Haba&apos;s lessons as for sure he was a<br/>great personality.</p><p>Concerning his Czech students, it&apos;s interesting many of them were in<br/>fact of Jewish descent with all those terrible consequences which<br/>came after 1939... Haba tried to help to his Jewish students so even<br/>his life was endangered.</p><p>What I remember roughly:<br/>Viktor Ullmann (1898-1944) was born in Silesia, German-Jewish origin,<br/>not Czech. One of those so called &quot;composers of Terezin (in German<br/>language Theresienstadt) ghetto&quot; and died in Oswiecim (Ausschwitz)...<br/>He finished his study with Haba in 1937. Name of his opera written in<br/>Terezin was &quot;Die Tod-Verweigerung&quot; (1943). There were more Czech<br/>composers of Jewish origin in Terezin, for example Pavel Haas...<br/>Thanks to political changes in former Czechoslovakia after 1989 and<br/>personal effort of some people those authors were brought from<br/>oblivion and become little bit famous, even fashionable.<br/>[Ad Terezin: this relatively small city was garrison city from the<br/>middle of 18th century, built as a fortress with fortification, named<br/>by Maria Theresia, and well preserved until now in this state. Nazis used it as an ideal station for concentration of Jewish people before<br/>sending them to other places where they were assasinated, because<br/>such city was easy to close and control. There was always a big<br/>amount of people, whole families including children, and people<br/>wanted desperately to live despite many of them probably could feel<br/>they will soon die.  So even some kind of culture was there, Nazis<br/>disused it for propaganda when Red Cross people come to check the<br/>conditions there. There were music concerts, even some orchestra.<br/>Composer Hans Krasa composed there his opera for children Brundibar,<br/>and it wan performed many times there, very often children performers<br/>were sent after performance to Ausschwitz... and training with new<br/>performers started next day again... ]</p><p>Jiri Srnka (1907-1982) become later famous and sought composer of<br/>film music, otherwise he is now forgotten.</p><p>Erwin Schulhoff (1894-1942) of German/Jewish origin was interesting<br/>person, pupil of Max Reger, excellent pianist and composer, also<br/>influenced by jazz or what he considered to be jazz those times (we<br/>know now it was more exactly American pop based on some jazz<br/>elements, in the sense of what Gershwin did). He performed on<br/>quartertone piano and did more demonstrating tours with Haba in<br/>Germany in 20ies. His works are unknown to the Czech public now.<br/>Politically he was of course na&icirc;ve and wrong when he believed in<br/>bolshevism. Solzhenicyn describe in his history of Gulag many cases<br/>that sympatizant foreigners who came to Russia  were<br/>propagandistically disused and many of them disappeared in the hell<br/>of working camps with whole families. So if Schulhoff isn&apos;t killed by<br/>one totalitarian establishment, for sure he would be terminated in<br/>Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union like many others. (What more: there was not so<br/>much sympathy to Jewish people as well in SU despite the fact that<br/>some leading persons of KGB were Jewish.)  As a composer he was<br/>brilliant.</p><p>Karel Reiner (1910-1979), studied with Haba 1934-35, was not so<br/>famous as a composer, more as a theoretician, teacher and pianist<br/>(quartertone piano including), later also in Terezin and other camps,<br/>he was even selected to &quot;march of death&quot; but survived. Now he is<br/>almost forgotten.</p><p>Miroslav Ponc (1902-1976) was another very interesting and<br/>unfortunately in Czech Republic now almost forgotten artist, who did<br/>lot of incidental music for theatre, film and radio drama music, also<br/>early experiments with optophony, audiovisual art  and similar. He<br/>studied with Haba in 1934-35 as his exclusive student (lot of the<br/>other studied composition with different teachers, and  just visited<br/>Haba&apos;s lessons as a part of their study).</p><p>Stepan Lucky (1919-2006) studied with Haba 1946-48 (after 1948<br/>communistic regime closed Department of Quartetone Music), composed<br/>lot of incidental music for theatre, radio, film... Most of his works<br/>are tonal, traditional. I  found only one quartertone work on his<br/>list - Three Studies for quartertone piano.</p><p>Rudolf Kubin (1909-1973) studied with Haba 1925-26 has only few<br/>quartertone works, which is strange, he was another exclusive student<br/>of him.</p><p>Jaroslav Jezek (1906-1942) was heavily eye-handicapped, almost blind,<br/>but talented expressionistic composer and pianist. He studied with<br/>Haba in 1927-28. I don&apos;t know any of his microintervallic works, but<br/>until now he is very famous as an author of revual music and pop<br/>songs for theatre, inspired by American pop. His songs are in Czech<br/>Republic well know, almost like a part of folklore... On the other<br/>side his serious works are not performed at all.</p><p>Vaclav Dobias (1909-1978), with Haba in 1939-40, after his promissing<br/>avantguarde period he changed during the war his compositional stylewhich become totally conform and traditional. Which helped him to<br/>become one of the prominent composers of communistic regime after<br/>1948, he wrote mass propagandistic songs and similar works. He left<br/>only few quartertone works, his main idol was Bedrich Smetana (and<br/>Smetana has NO quartertone piece!), he returned to his style. He<br/>doesn&apos;t deserve to be mentioned. Such &quot;artists&quot; serving as political<br/>propaganda supporters should be forgotten. In fact recently his works<br/>are not performed, that way he got what he deserved. History has no<br/>mercy... sometimes...</p><p>Karel Ancerl was known more as a conductor, I didn&apos;t know at all he<br/>also composed...</p><p>There were more students, some deserve to be named:<br/>Miroslav Kabelac (1908-1979) - outstanding composer, studied with<br/>Haba 1930-31.</p><p>Karel Haba (1898-1972) - violinist and composer, brother of Alois,<br/>studied with him 1923-1925. Few quartertone works.</p><p>Jan Rychlik (1916-1964) - excellent composer, one of the most<br/>interesting Czech composers. Unfortunately not known.</p><p>Gideon Klein (1919-1945) - also Jewish origin, studied with Haba as<br/>his exclusive student 1939-40. He was as well in Terezin ghetto<br/>(1941-44), where he wrote few works, and then he met his fate in<br/>Ausschwitz.</p><p>After the WW II Haba established &quot;Department for Quartertone and<br/>Sixthtone Music&quot; even on Prague Music Academy (AMU), 1946-1950.</p><p>Haba published early book on microintervals:<br/>1922 - Harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove hudby (Harmonic Ground ofQuartertone Music), later in his own translation to German, which was<br/>revisited by E. Steinhard and publish under the title Neue<br/>Harmonielehre, Leipzig 1927<br/>This book you offered for download, thank you very much, I didn&apos;t<br/>have it (does it mean you can understand Czech?). Right now after<br/>downloading I have read it, it has just few pages and I have learned<br/>fast-reading mode in my childhood. It&apos;s full of very funny<br/>statements, and my opinion about his late-romantism esthetic starting<br/>point was only confirmed. On one side he started to use something<br/>very unusual, on the other side he used there such terms like<br/>kvintakord (triad), septakord (seventh chord) etc. until 13, that<br/>means totally traditional classical chord structure based on thirds,<br/>just with quartertone alterations of more or less notes... He talks<br/>even about &quot;modulation&quot; etc., which is funny in context with<br/>quartertone terrain. And musical examples, when you erase all<br/>incidentals, look like Schumann or Wagner (OK, Mahler) :-)</p><p>and article in German:<br/>Die Theorie der Viertelt&ouml;ne - Theory of Quartertones (1925 in &quot;Von<br/>neuer Musik&quot; - About New Music)</p><p>It was written somewhere that he found microintervals in Moravian<br/>folklore in region he was born and started to derive his theories<br/>from this &quot;scientific folklorism&quot;. I don&apos;t think so. If we compare<br/>with Janacek: Janacek learned from Moravian folklore many things,<br/>modality of Eastern, Byzantinian type in melodics, modal harmonic<br/>progressions older then Baroque/Classicism functional harmony,<br/>unusual chromatic jumps and modulations caused probably mainly by<br/>lack of &quot;academic&quot; knowledge of theory by uneducated folk performers,<br/>but mainly some elements of arrangement, tectonics (irregularity in<br/>period&apos;s and motifs length), rhythm (irregularity, or opposite -<br/>regular ostinato, motoric rhythms)... But why Janacek didn&apos;t used at<br/>all microintervalls? A man who used very exact scientific methods for<br/>folklore analysis didn&apos;t mention some microintervals? Who collected a<br/>lot of folk tunes? Such job asks very good hearing, no doubt Janacek<br/>had perfect pitch.<br/>I have simple answer. In Moravian music there are NOT intentional<br/>microintervals. If you hear some, then they are caused by bad quality<br/>and distuned instruments, lack of knowledge and playing skills by<br/>uneducated folk players, who are usually only music amateurs, even<br/>autodidacts without any higher formal music education, many of them<br/>&quot;help&quot; themselves during folk dancing parties with pretty good amount<br/>of pretty good Moravian wines or even stronger alcohol - no wonder<br/>music can be slightly out of tune, out of rhythm... Just my personal<br/>theory based on deep knowledge of Moravian folklore (and Moravian<br/>wine - I&apos;m half Moravian).</p><p>In my opinion the biggest problem of Haba was a great disproportion<br/>between his let&apos;s say proclaimed avantguardism (expressed in quite<br/>unusual composing with microintervals, and he used them not only in<br/>melodic sense but also for chords, OK, out of tune triads..., and I<br/>have to mention here his &quot;athematic style&quot;) and quite traditional<br/>compositional method based on folklorism, late romanticism wide<br/>tonality, partly cool boring panchromatic expressionism... If I am<br/>very sarcastic it can be said his music sound like Mahler, Strauss,<br/>Debussy, Rimskij-Korsakov played by more or less drunken performers<br/>with intentionally distuned instruments and singers (and to be REALLY<br/>sarcastic I would say singers don&apos;t need to be drunken, thay just can<br/>sing like they are used to). Totally common, conform music style,<br/>which is just somehow out of tune. :-)<br/>Such composers like Janacek, Bartok, Holst, Stravinski, even Debussy<br/>were in certain sense more far in compositional thinking despite the<br/>fact they could use standard tuning systems, common diatonic scales,<br/>modes, or chromatic... Their modernism is more in tectonics,<br/>microtectonics, work with meter, rhythm...  Just my opinion.</p><p>Another problem with Haba&apos;s music is that of course it&apos;s pretty tough<br/>job to perform it, and not well accepted from public as result is not<br/>nice sounding music even when done perfectly. There are recently no<br/>musicians educated in microtonal performing in Czech Republic, so his<br/>music is not performed at all. Consequently not newly recorded, and<br/>what I have heard and could judge with my perfect pitch, it&apos;s only a<br/>very approximative attempt to play his music. In fact it has nothing<br/>to do with exact quartertones or other systems, it&apos;s just music which<br/>is totally out of tune, that&apos;s all.</p><p>I can&apos;t help myself to add another point of criticism of Haba music:<br/>he used only equal temperaments, that means another divisions of<br/>imperfect 12 ET system. Which beauty we can expect from such<br/>mathematically exact system? Nor mathematical neither artistic... It<br/>just sounds terribly. I personally don&apos;t like quartertones despite<br/>the fact I used them more times, and consider them to be rather unpleasant for listening. So in my opinion it was a big mistake of<br/>Haba to use only such systems, and not do some steps in direction of<br/>just intervals or systems with steps of different size... Which is<br/>quite strange when we remember he started with folklorism and even<br/>said that he derived microintervals from folklore music. What a<br/>contradiction!</p><p>I don&apos;t think he wrote too much compositions - over 100. And about<br/>half of it are in quartertone system. That means approx. two works<br/>per year only...</p><p>What&apos;s interesting he was follower of Steiner&apos;s anthroposophy.</p><p>Concerning some of his instruments - during my study at Brno<br/>Janacek&apos;s Academy of Music after 1986 there was Haba&apos;s quartertone<br/>Foerster piano rented from Prague Museum, unfortunately later it<br/>disappeared, probably returned to the museum. When I started my work<br/>there as a teacher in 1990, it was not to find. Haba wrote in his<br/>book that president Masaryk supported Haba&apos;s work and granted him<br/>big amount of money to build this piano.</p><p>Fate of his sixthtone harmonium with six small manuals is sad as<br/>well: this instrument was during my Conservatory study of pipe organ<br/>and composition (1973-1979) deposited in organ classroom, somewhere<br/>in dark corner behind the school organ, full of dust, nobody used it<br/>and it slowly started to become a ruin. I remember still my surprise<br/>to find it there, nobody knew any details about it, I liked to<br/>improvise on it sometimes, it still worked. (Maybe here my interest<br/>in microintervals started, who knows...) When after political changes<br/>in 1989 it was possible to ask such questions, and I wanted to buy<br/>the ruin, restore it and use, I was told it was destroyed. Such<br/>ignorant idiots were on important leading places before 1989, and<br/>they could do such decisions... What a pity. (I&apos;m afraid situation<br/>now doesn&apos;t differ too much...)</p><p>Sorry for rather too long message, I couldn&apos;t resist.</p><p>Have a nice day.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 24 Sep 2008, at 4:18 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; __<br/>&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; __<br/>&gt; 4. harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove soustavy<br/>&gt;     Posted by: &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&gt; daniel_anthony_stearns@... daniel_anthony_stearns<br/>&gt;     Date: Tue Sep 23, 2008 4:36 pm ((PDT))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alois Haba was an early microtonalist and a proponent of various<br/>&gt; fractional divisions of the octave . Few articles would serve as a<br/>&gt; better introduction to Haba than this one:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6xpmo9">http://tinyurl.com/6xpmo9</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought the bit in about Haba&apos;s ascension to professorship at the<br/>&gt; Prague Conservatory was very interesting... for ten years Haba taught<br/>&gt; at the Conservatory on the basis of an annually renewed permission to<br/>&gt; hold &quot;courses in microtonal music&quot;-------&gt;microtonal music was not a<br/>&gt; separate subject in the curriculum, but was considered a department<br/>&gt; of the composition class and could only be taken by students who had<br/>&gt; already taken the required composition subjects. It wasn&apos;t until 1934<br/>&gt; that Haba was appointed a professor of composition at the<br/>&gt; Conservatory. Among his many students, several of whom went on to<br/>&gt; produce and promote fractional interval music themselves, were<br/>&gt; Ljubica Maric, Jeronimas Kacinskas, Viktor Ullmann, Slavko Osterc,<br/>&gt; Constantin Iliev, Jiri Srnka, Necil Kazim Akses, Erwin Schulhoff,<br/>&gt; Karel Reiner, Miroslav Ponc, Stepan Lucky, Rudolf Kubin, Jaroslav<br/>&gt; Jezek, Vaclav Dobias, Karel Ancerl, and many, many others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haba composed an awful lot of quarter-tone music, including a full<br/>&gt; quarter-tone opera, Matka, and six string quartets (nos. 2, 3, 4, 6,<br/>&gt; 12 and 14), six suites, eleven fantasies and a sonata for piano, and<br/>&gt; two suites for guitar. Haba also composed pieces using other<br/>&gt; fractional divisions of the tone, like string quartet no. 16 in fifth-<br/>&gt; tones, and string quartets (nos. 5, 10 and 11) and suites for solo<br/>&gt; violin and cello in sixth-tones. Unfortunately, almost all of Haba&apos;s<br/>&gt; recordings are very difficult to find and usually quite expensive as<br/>&gt; well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haba, like Carrillo in Mexico, was also influential enough to managed<br/>&gt; to have special microtonal instruments made to his specifications.<br/>&gt; For example, the piano manufacturer A. Forster built a quarter-tone<br/>&gt; piano and a sixth-tone harmonium at his request. He also convinced<br/>&gt; other manufactures to make him a quarter-tone clarinet and trumpet,<br/>&gt; and later a quarter-tone guitar. Haba also wrote two important<br/>&gt; microtonal textbooks, Neue Harmonielehre des diatonischen,<br/>&gt; chromatischen, Viertel-, Drittel-, Sechstel-, und Zwolfteltonsystems<br/>&gt; and Harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove soustavy. FWIW, I have the latter<br/>&gt; of these in Czech transferred to PDF at yousendit, and I&apos;d be happy<br/>&gt; to share it with anyone who&apos;d be interested:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4cbtuj">http://tinyurl.com/4cbtuj</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s also, of course, striking what a dark time in the development of<br/>&gt; the modern psyche this whole period was set in, and the unimaginable<br/>&gt; consequences it brought about. Just out of the very small and<br/>&gt; particular group of composers I mentioned here as former students of<br/>&gt; Haba, two were killed in the concentration camps; Viktor Ullmann and<br/>&gt; Erwin Schulhoff. After the Nazi seizure of Czechoslavakia, Ullmann<br/>&gt; was sent to Theresienstadt, where he somehow manager to compose a one-<br/>&gt; act opera, Der Kaiser von Atlantis, which was based on a tyrannical<br/>&gt; monarch who outlaws death only to later beg for its return to relieve<br/>&gt; humanity from the horrors of living. He later died, most likely at<br/>&gt; Auschwitz. Schulhoff was a member of the communist party, and after<br/>&gt; the Nazi occupation in 1939 was granted Soviet citizenship to protect<br/>&gt; him from arrest. But after the 1941 Nazi invasion of Russia, he was<br/>&gt; arrested and later died in the concentration camps. Others, like<br/>&gt; Stephan Lucky (detained at Terezin, Dachau, and Auschwitz) and Karel<br/>&gt; Reiner (detained at Bucharest, Auschwitz and Buchenwald) miraculously<br/>&gt; survived and even composed again after liberation.

Given the aversion of the ruling elite of the young Turkish<br/>Republic to &quot;quarter-tones&quot; (that was frequently associated with<br/>Arabism and Byzantinism - which was considered abominable to<br/>modernized Turkish taste) I do not think that these composers, who<br/>were subsisting on state funds, could risk their livelihood composing<br/>avant-garde music employing &quot;Arabic&quot; or &quot;Byzantine&quot; intervals shunned<br/>as a state policy. As a matter of fact, you can read Adnan Saygun&apos;s<br/>and Cemal Reshid Rey&apos;s (best known of the Turkish Five) as well as<br/>Osman Zeki Ungor&apos;s outbursts on this topic in support of the state<br/>policy in my doctorate dissertation. Consider, that the richly micro-<br/>intervallic maqam music tradition has been subjected to abuses<br/>starting from 1926. The situation did not change with the death of<br/>Kemal Ataturk and the rise to power of Ismet Inonu, since Inonu fully<br/>supported the westernization efforts in culture and economical/<br/>political integration with USA. It is ironic that the West has made<br/>great strides in musical exploration outside of 12 equal semitones to<br/>the octave since, while Turkiye has succumbed to pre-1945 methods and<br/>aspirations of polyphony consigned to 12 equal tones per octave.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>On Sep 24, 2008, at 6:27 PM, Daniel Forro wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi, Mr. Stearns,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; your interesting and to me slightly surprising message about Alois<br/>&gt; Haba forced me to switch from lurking mode (ROM = reading only<br/>&gt; member) and I&apos;m trying to compose my first message here and add<br/>&gt; something to yours as I think I had maybe something to say.<br/>&gt; Concerning my lurking mode, first - English is not my native<br/>&gt; language, second - I&apos;m shy person usually in the beginning of<br/>&gt; communication (which can quickly change), third - there&apos;s not too<br/>&gt; much time in a fight for my daily bread to be deeply involved even in<br/>&gt; very interesting discussions, done by prominent members here, fourth<br/>&gt; - one of my former students, Petr Parizek, is here enough active to<br/>&gt; write and do a lot in the direction I taught him...

You are<br/>&gt; pretty well informed about lot of things, maybe just a few additional<br/>&gt; facts from my side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First I would say there is internationally renowned term &quot;Haba<br/>&gt; School&quot;, which doesn&apos;t mean at all &quot;microintervallic music&quot; school.<br/>&gt; Haba was excellent and influential teacher with very wide knowledge,<br/>&gt; open to all new ideas. His lessons were more like a seminar, lectures<br/>&gt; widely oriented on experimental acoustics, analysis of &quot;Oriental&quot;<br/>&gt; music, (in those times Czech terminology Turkey, Near East, Arabia,<br/>&gt; Egypt, North African countries, and maybe more to the East), role of<br/>&gt; music in society etc. - nobody did those times anything similar.<br/>&gt; Haba was a lecturer at Prague Conservatory since 1923, since 1924 he<br/>&gt; started his course of quartertone music, opened for everybody who was<br/>&gt; interested! He became officially Professor since 1934 and &quot;Department<br/>&gt; of Quartertone and Sixthtone Music&quot; (not microtonal as you wrote, OK,<br/>&gt; you didn&apos;t quoted anything, it&apos;s just a translation) was established.<br/>&gt; First those times AFAIK term &quot;microtonal&quot; was not used, second he<br/>&gt; probably wanted to attract foreign students from &quot;oriental&quot; countries<br/>&gt; using relatively known terms. Haba and his students even took part<br/>&gt; and have been demonstrating quartertone music for about sixth month<br/>&gt; period at the very first (and for longer time the last one) Frankfurt<br/>&gt; Music Fair in 1927 and some students (I think mainly Miroslav Ponc)<br/>&gt; have been demonstrating &quot;quartertone music&quot; in lectures and concerts<br/>&gt; with success, and public was attracted. I&apos;m not sure if they were<br/>&gt; there because Haba was those times internationally renowned, or if<br/>&gt; his good fame came after this event. But probably thanks to this<br/>&gt; event Haba got some foreign students...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Many of Haba students just visited his lessons for inspiration, they<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t compose microintervallic works at all. Classes continued even<br/>&gt; during German occupation 1939-1945, but principially they couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; work fully as official German propaganda those times considered all<br/>&gt; experimental music to be &quot;entartete Art&quot; (perverse art) and similar<br/>&gt; music was officially prohibited as well as &quot;inferior nigger&apos;s jazz&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I haven&apos;t here at my hand a book about Haba written by Brno<br/>&gt; musicologist Jiri Vyslouzil for quoting more details, but foreign<br/>&gt; students as you write were by names from former Yugoslavian Kingdom<br/>&gt; (Slovenia, Serbia... there were more: Maric, Vuckovic, Ristic...),<br/>&gt; Bulgaria (Iliev studied with him after WW II, another student was V.<br/>&gt; A. Bozinov), Turkey (Mr. Ozan, do you know somehing about?),<br/>&gt; Kacinskas was Lithuanian, Wiesmayer was British violinist. AFAIK<br/>&gt; nobody of them composed microintervallic music in big numbers, and as<br/>&gt; their main compositional method. To my surprise many of them wrote<br/>&gt; very conventional music, or neoclassical... They took it just as an<br/>&gt; additional course. My theory is somehow those times maybe probably<br/>&gt; they considered it fashionable, somehow they felt they are &quot;in&quot;.<br/>&gt; Maybe. Or they just like to visit Haba&apos;s lessons as for sure he was a<br/>&gt; great personality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Concerning his Czech students, it&apos;s interesting many of them were in<br/>&gt; fact of Jewish descent with all those terrible consequences which<br/>&gt; came after 1939... Haba tried to help to his Jewish students so even<br/>&gt; his life was endangered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I remember roughly:<br/>&gt; Viktor Ullmann (1898-1944) was born in Silesia, German-Jewish origin,<br/>&gt; not Czech. One of those so called &quot;composers of Terezin (in German<br/>&gt; language Theresienstadt) ghetto&quot; and died in Oswiecim (Ausschwitz)...<br/>&gt; He finished his study with Haba in 1937. Name of his opera written in<br/>&gt; Terezin was &quot;Die Tod-Verweigerung&quot; (1943). There were more Czech<br/>&gt; composers of Jewish origin in Terezin, for example Pavel Haas...<br/>&gt; Thanks to political changes in former Czechoslovakia after 1989 and<br/>&gt; personal effort of some people those authors were brought from<br/>&gt; oblivion and become little bit famous, even fashionable.<br/>&gt; [Ad Terezin: this relatively small city was garrison city from the<br/>&gt; middle of 18th century, built as a fortress with fortification, named<br/>&gt; by Maria Theresia, and well preserved until now in this state. Nazis<br/>&gt; used it as an ideal station for concentration of Jewish people before<br/>&gt; sending them to other places where they were assasinated, because<br/>&gt; such city was easy to close and control. There was always a big<br/>&gt; amount of people, whole families including children, and people<br/>&gt; wanted desperately to live despite many of them probably could feel<br/>&gt; they will soon die.  So even some kind of culture was there, Nazis<br/>&gt; disused it for propaganda when Red Cross people come to check the<br/>&gt; conditions there. There were music concerts, even some orchestra.<br/>&gt; Composer Hans Krasa composed there his opera for children Brundibar,<br/>&gt; and it wan performed many times there, very often children performers<br/>&gt; were sent after performance to Ausschwitz... and training with new<br/>&gt; performers started next day again... ]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jiri Srnka (1907-1982) become later famous and sought composer of<br/>&gt; film music, otherwise he is now forgotten.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Erwin Schulhoff (1894-1942) of German/Jewish origin was interesting<br/>&gt; person, pupil of Max Reger, excellent pianist and composer, also<br/>&gt; influenced by jazz or what he considered to be jazz those times (we<br/>&gt; know now it was more exactly American pop based on some jazz<br/>&gt; elements, in the sense of what Gershwin did). He performed on<br/>&gt; quartertone piano and did more demonstrating tours with Haba in<br/>&gt; Germany in 20ies. His works are unknown to the Czech public now.<br/>&gt; Politically he was of course na&icirc;ve and wrong when he believed in<br/>&gt; bolshevism. Solzhenicyn describe in his history of Gulag many cases<br/>&gt; that sympatizant foreigners who came to Russia  were<br/>&gt; propagandistically disused and many of them disappeared in the hell<br/>&gt; of working camps with whole families. So if Schulhoff isn&apos;t killed by<br/>&gt; one totalitarian establishment, for sure he would be terminated in<br/>&gt; Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union like many others. (What more: there was not so<br/>&gt; much sympathy to Jewish people as well in SU despite the fact that<br/>&gt; some leading persons of KGB were Jewish.)  As a composer he was<br/>&gt; brilliant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Karel Reiner (1910-1979), studied with Haba 1934-35, was not so<br/>&gt; famous as a composer, more as a theoretician, teacher and pianist<br/>&gt; (quartertone piano including), later also in Terezin and other camps,<br/>&gt; he was even selected to &quot;march of death&quot; but survived. Now he is<br/>&gt; almost forgotten.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Miroslav Ponc (1902-1976) was another very interesting and<br/>&gt; unfortunately in Czech Republic now almost forgotten artist, who did<br/>&gt; lot of incidental music for theatre, film and radio drama music, also<br/>&gt; early experiments with optophony, audiovisual art  and similar. He<br/>&gt; studied with Haba in 1934-35 as his exclusive student (lot of the<br/>&gt; other studied composition with different teachers, and  just visited<br/>&gt; Haba&apos;s lessons as a part of their study).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Stepan Lucky (1919-2006) studied with Haba 1946-48 (after 1948<br/>&gt; communistic regime closed Department of Quartetone Music), composed<br/>&gt; lot of incidental music for theatre, radio, film... Most of his works<br/>&gt; are tonal, traditional. I  found only one quartertone work on his<br/>&gt; list - Three Studies for quartertone piano.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rudolf Kubin (1909-1973) studied with Haba 1925-26 has only few<br/>&gt; quartertone works, which is strange, he was another exclusive student<br/>&gt; of him.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jaroslav Jezek (1906-1942) was heavily eye-handicapped, almost blind,<br/>&gt; but talented expressionistic composer and pianist. He studied with<br/>&gt; Haba in 1927-28. I don&apos;t know any of his microintervallic works, but<br/>&gt; until now he is very famous as an author of revual music and pop<br/>&gt; songs for theatre, inspired by American pop. His songs are in Czech<br/>&gt; Republic well know, almost like a part of folklore... On the other<br/>&gt; side his serious works are not performed at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Vaclav Dobias (1909-1978), with Haba in 1939-40, after his promissing<br/>&gt; avantguarde period he changed during the war his compositional style<br/>&gt; which become totally conform and traditional. Which helped him to<br/>&gt; become one of the prominent composers of communistic regime after<br/>&gt; 1948, he wrote mass propagandistic songs and similar works. He left<br/>&gt; only few quartertone works, his main idol was Bedrich Smetana (and<br/>&gt; Smetana has NO quartertone piece!), he returned to his style. He<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t deserve to be mentioned. Such &quot;artists&quot; serving as political<br/>&gt; propaganda supporters should be forgotten. In fact recently his works<br/>&gt; are not performed, that way he got what he deserved. History has no<br/>&gt; mercy... sometimes...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Karel Ancerl was known more as a conductor, I didn&apos;t know at all he<br/>&gt; also composed...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There were more students, some deserve to be named:<br/>&gt; Miroslav Kabelac (1908-1979) - outstanding composer, studied with<br/>&gt; Haba 1930-31.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Karel Haba (1898-1972) - violinist and composer, brother of Alois,<br/>&gt; studied with him 1923-1925. Few quartertone works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jan Rychlik (1916-1964) - excellent composer, one of the most<br/>&gt; interesting Czech composers. Unfortunately not known.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gideon Klein (1919-1945) - also Jewish origin, studied with Haba as<br/>&gt; his exclusive student 1939-40. He was as well in Terezin ghetto<br/>&gt; (1941-44), where he wrote few works, and then he met his fate in<br/>&gt; Ausschwitz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After the WW II Haba established &quot;Department for Quartertone and<br/>&gt; Sixthtone Music&quot; even on Prague Music Academy (AMU), 1946-1950.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haba published early book on microintervals:<br/>&gt; 1922 - Harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove hudby (Harmonic Ground of<br/>&gt; Quartertone Music), later in his own translation to German, which was<br/>&gt; revisited by E. Steinhard and publish under the title Neue<br/>&gt; Harmonielehre, Leipzig 1927<br/>&gt; This book you offered for download, thank you very much, I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have it (does it mean you can understand Czech?). Right now after<br/>&gt; downloading I have read it, it has just few pages and I have learned<br/>&gt; fast-reading mode in my childhood. It&apos;s full of very funny<br/>&gt; statements, and my opinion about his late-romantism esthetic starting<br/>&gt; point was only confirmed. On one side he started to use something<br/>&gt; very unusual, on the other side he used there such terms like<br/>&gt; kvintakord (triad), septakord (seventh chord) etc. until 13, that<br/>&gt; means totally traditional classical chord structure based on thirds,<br/>&gt; just with quartertone alterations of more or less notes... He talks<br/>&gt; even about &quot;modulation&quot; etc., which is funny in context with<br/>&gt; quartertone terrain. And musical examples, when you erase all<br/>&gt; incidentals, look like Schumann or Wagner (OK, Mahler) :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and article in German:<br/>&gt; Die Theorie der Viertelt&ouml;ne - Theory of Quartertones (1925 in &quot;Von<br/>&gt; neuer Musik&quot; - About New Music)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was written somewhere that he found microintervals in Moravian<br/>&gt; folklore in region he was born and started to derive his theories<br/>&gt; from this &quot;scientific folklorism&quot;. I don&apos;t think so. If we compare<br/>&gt; with Janacek: Janacek learned from Moravian folklore many things,<br/>&gt; modality of Eastern, Byzantinian type in melodics, modal harmonic<br/>&gt; progressions older then Baroque/Classicism functional harmony,<br/>&gt; unusual chromatic jumps and modulations caused probably mainly by<br/>&gt; lack of &quot;academic&quot; knowledge of theory by uneducated folk performers,<br/>&gt; but mainly some elements of arrangement, tectonics (irregularity in<br/>&gt; period&apos;s and motifs length), rhythm (irregularity, or opposite -<br/>&gt; regular ostinato, motoric rhythms)... But why Janacek didn&apos;t used at<br/>&gt; all microintervalls? A man who used very exact scientific methods for<br/>&gt; folklore analysis didn&apos;t mention some microintervals? Who collected a<br/>&gt; lot of folk tunes? Such job asks very good hearing, no doubt Janacek<br/>&gt; had perfect pitch.<br/>&gt; I have simple answer. In Moravian music there are NOT intentional<br/>&gt; microintervals. If you hear some, then they are caused by bad quality<br/>&gt; and distuned instruments, lack of knowledge and playing skills by<br/>&gt; uneducated folk players, who are usually only music amateurs, even<br/>&gt; autodidacts without any higher formal music education, many of them<br/>&gt; &quot;help&quot; themselves during folk dancing parties with pretty good amount<br/>&gt; of pretty good Moravian wines or even stronger alcohol - no wonder<br/>&gt; music can be slightly out of tune, out of rhythm... Just my personal<br/>&gt; theory based on deep knowledge of Moravian folklore (and Moravian<br/>&gt; wine - I&apos;m half Moravian).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my opinion the biggest problem of Haba was a great disproportion<br/>&gt; between his let&apos;s say proclaimed avantguardism (expressed in quite<br/>&gt; unusual composing with microintervals, and he used them not only in<br/>&gt; melodic sense but also for chords, OK, out of tune triads..., and I<br/>&gt; have to mention here his &quot;athematic style&quot;) and quite traditional<br/>&gt; compositional method based on folklorism, late romanticism wide<br/>&gt; tonality, partly cool boring panchromatic expressionism... If I am<br/>&gt; very sarcastic it can be said his music sound like Mahler, Strauss,<br/>&gt; Debussy, Rimskij-Korsakov played by more or less drunken performers<br/>&gt; with intentionally distuned instruments and singers (and to be REALLY<br/>&gt; sarcastic I would say singers don&apos;t need to be drunken, thay just can<br/>&gt; sing like they are used to). Totally common, conform music style,<br/>&gt; which is just somehow out of tune. :-)<br/>&gt; Such composers like Janacek, Bartok, Holst, Stravinski, even Debussy<br/>&gt; were in certain sense more far in compositional thinking despite the<br/>&gt; fact they could use standard tuning systems, common diatonic scales,<br/>&gt; modes, or chromatic... Their modernism is more in tectonics,<br/>&gt; microtectonics, work with meter, rhythm...  Just my opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another problem with Haba&apos;s music is that of course it&apos;s pretty tough<br/>&gt; job to perform it, and not well accepted from public as result is not<br/>&gt; nice sounding music even when done perfectly. There are recently no<br/>&gt; musicians educated in microtonal performing in Czech Republic, so his<br/>&gt; music is not performed at all. Consequently not newly recorded, and<br/>&gt; what I have heard and could judge with my perfect pitch, it&apos;s only a<br/>&gt; very approximative attempt to play his music. In fact it has nothing<br/>&gt; to do with exact quartertones or other systems, it&apos;s just music which<br/>&gt; is totally out of tune, that&apos;s all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t help myself to add another point of criticism of Haba music:<br/>&gt; he used only equal temperaments, that means another divisions of<br/>&gt; imperfect 12 ET system. Which beauty we can expect from such<br/>&gt; mathematically exact system? Nor mathematical neither artistic... It<br/>&gt; just sounds terribly. I personally don&apos;t like quartertones despite<br/>&gt; the fact I used them more times, and consider them to be rather<br/>&gt; unpleasant for listening. So in my opinion it was a big mistake of<br/>&gt; Haba to use only such systems, and not do some steps in direction of<br/>&gt; just intervals or systems with steps of different size... Which is<br/>&gt; quite strange when we remember he started with folklorism and even<br/>&gt; said that he derived microintervals from folklore music. What a<br/>&gt; contradiction!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think he wrote too much compositions - over 100. And about<br/>&gt; half of it are in quartertone system. That means approx. two works<br/>&gt; per year only...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s interesting he was follower of Steiner&apos;s anthroposophy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Concerning some of his instruments - during my study at Brno<br/>&gt; Janacek&apos;s Academy of Music after 1986 there was Haba&apos;s quartertone<br/>&gt; Foerster piano rented from Prague Museum, unfortunately later it<br/>&gt; disappeared, probably returned to the museum. When I started my work<br/>&gt; there as a teacher in 1990, it was not to find. Haba wrote in his<br/>&gt; book that president Masaryk supported Haba&apos;s work and granted him<br/>&gt; big amount of money to build this piano.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fate of his sixthtone harmonium with six small manuals is sad as<br/>&gt; well: this instrument was during my Conservatory study of pipe organ<br/>&gt; and composition (1973-1979) deposited in organ classroom, somewhere<br/>&gt; in dark corner behind the school organ, full of dust, nobody used it<br/>&gt; and it slowly started to become a ruin. I remember still my surprise<br/>&gt; to find it there, nobody knew any details about it, I liked to<br/>&gt; improvise on it sometimes, it still worked. (Maybe here my interest<br/>&gt; in microintervals started, who knows...) When after political changes<br/>&gt; in 1989 it was possible to ask such questions, and I wanted to buy<br/>&gt; the ruin, restore it and use, I was told it was destroyed. Such<br/>&gt; ignorant idiots were on important leading places before 1989, and<br/>&gt; they could do such decisions... What a pity. (I&apos;m afraid situation<br/>&gt; now doesn&apos;t differ too much...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for rather too long message, I couldn&apos;t resist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have a nice day.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 24 Sep 2008, at 4:18 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;&gt; __<br/>&gt;&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;&gt; __<br/>&gt;&gt; 4. harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove soustavy<br/>&gt;&gt;    Posted by: &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; daniel_anthony_stearns@... daniel_anthony_stearns<br/>&gt;&gt;    Date: Tue Sep 23, 2008 4:36 pm ((PDT))<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Alois Haba was an early microtonalist and a proponent of various<br/>&gt;&gt; fractional divisions of the octave . Few articles would serve as a<br/>&gt;&gt; better introduction to Haba than this one:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6xpmo9">http://tinyurl.com/6xpmo9</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I thought the bit in about Haba&apos;s ascension to professorship at the<br/>&gt;&gt; Prague Conservatory was very interesting... for ten years Haba taught<br/>&gt;&gt; at the Conservatory on the basis of an annually renewed permission to<br/>&gt;&gt; hold &quot;courses in microtonal music&quot;-------&gt;microtonal music was not a<br/>&gt;&gt; separate subject in the curriculum, but was considered a department<br/>&gt;&gt; of the composition class and could only be taken by students who had<br/>&gt;&gt; already taken the required composition subjects. It wasn&apos;t until 1934<br/>&gt;&gt; that Haba was appointed a professor of composition at the<br/>&gt;&gt; Conservatory. Among his many students, several of whom went on to<br/>&gt;&gt; produce and promote fractional interval music themselves, were<br/>&gt;&gt; Ljubica Maric, Jeronimas Kacinskas, Viktor Ullmann, Slavko Osterc,<br/>&gt;&gt; Constantin Iliev, Jiri Srnka, Necil Kazim Akses, Erwin Schulhoff,<br/>&gt;&gt; Karel Reiner, Miroslav Ponc, Stepan Lucky, Rudolf Kubin, Jaroslav<br/>&gt;&gt; Jezek, Vaclav Dobias, Karel Ancerl, and many, many others.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Haba composed an awful lot of quarter-tone music, including a full<br/>&gt;&gt; quarter-tone opera, Matka, and six string quartets (nos. 2, 3, 4, 6,<br/>&gt;&gt; 12 and 14), six suites, eleven fantasies and a sonata for piano, and<br/>&gt;&gt; two suites for guitar. Haba also composed pieces using other<br/>&gt;&gt; fractional divisions of the tone, like string quartet no. 16 in<br/>&gt;&gt; fifth-<br/>&gt;&gt; tones, and string quartets (nos. 5, 10 and 11) and suites for solo<br/>&gt;&gt; violin and cello in sixth-tones. Unfortunately, almost all of Haba&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; recordings are very difficult to find and usually quite expensive as<br/>&gt;&gt; well.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Haba, like Carrillo in Mexico, was also influential enough to managed<br/>&gt;&gt; to have special microtonal instruments made to his specifications.<br/>&gt;&gt; For example, the piano manufacturer A. Forster built a quarter-tone<br/>&gt;&gt; piano and a sixth-tone harmonium at his request. He also convinced<br/>&gt;&gt; other manufactures to make him a quarter-tone clarinet and trumpet,<br/>&gt;&gt; and later a quarter-tone guitar. Haba also wrote two important<br/>&gt;&gt; microtonal textbooks, Neue Harmonielehre des diatonischen,<br/>&gt;&gt; chromatischen, Viertel-, Drittel-, Sechstel-, und Zwolfteltonsystems<br/>&gt;&gt; and Harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove soustavy. FWIW, I have the latter<br/>&gt;&gt; of these in Czech transferred to PDF at yousendit, and I&apos;d be happy<br/>&gt;&gt; to share it with anyone who&apos;d be interested:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4cbtuj">http://tinyurl.com/4cbtuj</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It&apos;s also, of course, striking what a dark time in the development of<br/>&gt;&gt; the modern psyche this whole period was set in, and the unimaginable<br/>&gt;&gt; consequences it brought about. Just out of the very small and<br/>&gt;&gt; particular group of composers I mentioned here as former students of<br/>&gt;&gt; Haba, two were killed in the concentration camps; Viktor Ullmann and<br/>&gt;&gt; Erwin Schulhoff. After the Nazi seizure of Czechoslavakia, Ullmann<br/>&gt;&gt; was sent to Theresienstadt, where he somehow manager to compose a<br/>&gt;&gt; one-<br/>&gt;&gt; act opera, Der Kaiser von Atlantis, which was based on a tyrannical<br/>&gt;&gt; monarch who outlaws death only to later beg for its return to relieve<br/>&gt;&gt; humanity from the horrors of living. He later died, most likely at<br/>&gt;&gt; Auschwitz. Schulhoff was a member of the communist party, and after<br/>&gt;&gt; the Nazi occupation in 1939 was granted Soviet citizenship to protect<br/>&gt;&gt; him from arrest. But after the 1941 Nazi invasion of Russia, he was<br/>&gt;&gt; arrested and later died in the concentration camps. Others, like<br/>&gt;&gt; Stephan Lucky (detained at Terezin, Dachau, and Auschwitz) and Karel<br/>&gt;&gt; Reiner (detained at Bucharest, Auschwitz and Buchenwald) miraculously<br/>&gt;&gt; survived and even composed again after liberation. I can&apos;t even begin<br/>&gt;&gt; to imagine.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://netnewmusic.ning.com/profile/danstearns">http://netnewmusic.ning.com/profile/danstearns</a><br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a><br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_4/</a><br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/danstearns">http://www.youtube.com/user/danstearns</a><br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_5/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_5/</a><br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/avantgarde_jazzguitar/">http://zebox.com/avantgarde_jazzguitar/</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

But in the worse<br/>case I can write more about myself and my work if somebody is<br/>interested which I doubt. In the meantime you are welcome to visit my<br/>web pages and eventually listen to some of my music crimes (some of<br/>them microintervallic):</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/forrotronics">www.soundclick.com/forrotronics</a><br/><a href="http://daikichi.p-kit.com">daikichi.p-kit.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.forrotronics.cz">www.forrotronics.cz</a></p><p>As a person who<br/>- is Czech origin<br/>- is a founder and chairman of Czech Society for Microintervallic<br/>Music (I don&apos;t like a term &quot;microtonal&quot;, &quot;microtonality&quot; as it evokes<br/>&quot;small tonality&quot;, in Czech language we use &quot;mikrointerval&quot; =<br/>&quot;microinterval&quot;)</p><p>of course I know something about the facts you have written. You are<br/>pretty well informed about lot of things, maybe just a few additional<br/>facts from my side.</p><p>First I would say there is internationally renowned term &quot;Haba<br/>School&quot;, which doesn&apos;t mean at all &quot;microintervallic music&quot; school.<br/>Haba was excellent and influential teacher with very wide knowledge,<br/>open to all new ideas. His lessons were more like a seminar, lectures<br/>widely oriented on experimental acoustics, analysis of &quot;Oriental&quot;<br/>music, (in those times Czech terminology Turkey, Near East, Arabia,<br/>Egypt, North African countries, and maybe more to the East), role of<br/>music in society etc. - nobody did those times anything similar.<br/>Haba was a lecturer at Prague Conservatory since 1923, since 1924 he<br/>started his course of quartertone music, opened for everybody who was<br/>interested! He became officially Professor since 1934 and &quot;Departmentof Quartertone and Sixthtone Music&quot; (not microtonal as you wrote, OK,<br/>you didn&apos;t quoted anything, it&apos;s just a translation) was established.<br/>First those times AFAIK term &quot;microtonal&quot; was not used, second he<br/>probably wanted to attract foreign students from &quot;oriental&quot; countries<br/>using relatively known terms. Haba and his students even took part<br/>and have been demonstrating quartertone music for about sixth month<br/>period at the very first (and for longer time the last one) Frankfurt<br/>Music Fair in 1927 and some students (I think mainly Miroslav Ponc)<br/>have been demonstrating &quot;quartertone music&quot; in lectures and concerts<br/>with success, and public was attracted. I&apos;m not sure if they were<br/>there because Haba was those times internationally renowned, or if<br/>his good fame came after this event. But probably thanks to this<br/>event Haba got some foreign students...</p><p>Many of Haba students just visited his lessons for inspiration, they<br/>didn&apos;t compose microintervallic works at all. Classes continued even<br/>during German occupation 1939-1945, but principially they couldn&apos;t<br/>work fully as official German propaganda those times considered all<br/>experimental music to be &quot;entartete Art&quot; (perverse art) and similar<br/>music was officially prohibited as well as &quot;inferior nigger&apos;s jazz&quot;.</p><p>Now I haven&apos;t here at my hand a book about Haba written by Brno<br/>musicologist Jiri Vyslouzil for quoting more details, but foreign<br/>students as you write were by names from former Yugoslavian Kingdom<br/>(Slovenia, Serbia... there were more: Maric, Vuckovic, Ristic...),Bulgaria (Iliev studied with him after WW II, another student was V.<br/>A. Bozinov), Turkey (Mr. Ozan, do you know somehing about?),<br/>Kacinskas was Lithuanian, Wiesmayer was British violinist. AFAIK<br/>nobody of them composed microintervallic music in big numbers, and as<br/>their main compositional method. To my surprise many of them wrote<br/>very conventional music, or neoclassical... They took it just as an<br/>additional course. My theory is somehow those times maybe probably<br/>they considered it fashionable, somehow they felt they are &quot;in&quot;.<br/>Maybe. Or they just like to visit Haba&apos;s lessons as for sure he was a<br/>great personality.</p><p>Concerning his Czech students, it&apos;s interesting many of them were in<br/>fact of Jewish descent with all those terrible consequences which<br/>came after 1939... Haba tried to help to his Jewish students so even<br/>his life was endangered.</p><p>What I remember roughly:<br/>Viktor Ullmann (1898-1944) was born in Silesia, German-Jewish origin,<br/>not Czech. One of those so called &quot;composers of Terezin (in German<br/>language Theresienstadt) ghetto&quot; and died in Oswiecim (Ausschwitz)...<br/>He finished his study with Haba in 1937. Name of his opera written in<br/>Terezin was &quot;Die Tod-Verweigerung&quot; (1943). There were more Czech<br/>composers of Jewish origin in Terezin, for example Pavel Haas...<br/>Thanks to political changes in former Czechoslovakia after 1989 and<br/>personal effort of some people those authors were brought from<br/>oblivion and become little bit famous, even fashionable.<br/>[Ad Terezin: this relatively small city was garrison city from the<br/>middle of 18th century, built as a fortress with fortification, named<br/>by Maria Theresia, and well preserved until now in this state. Nazis used it as an ideal station for concentration of Jewish people before<br/>sending them to other places where they were assasinated, because<br/>such city was easy to close and control. There was always a big<br/>amount of people, whole families including children, and people<br/>wanted desperately to live despite many of them probably could feel<br/>they will soon die.  So even some kind of culture was there, Nazis<br/>disused it for propaganda when Red Cross people come to check the<br/>conditions there. There were music concerts, even some orchestra.<br/>Composer Hans Krasa composed there his opera for children Brundibar,<br/>and it wan performed many times there, very often children performers<br/>were sent after performance to Ausschwitz... and training with new<br/>performers started next day again... ]</p><p>Jiri Srnka (1907-1982) become later famous and sought composer of<br/>film music, otherwise he is now forgotten.</p><p>Erwin Schulhoff (1894-1942) of German/Jewish origin was interesting<br/>person, pupil of Max Reger, excellent pianist and composer, also<br/>influenced by jazz or what he considered to be jazz those times (we<br/>know now it was more exactly American pop based on some jazz<br/>elements, in the sense of what Gershwin did). He performed on<br/>quartertone piano and did more demonstrating tours with Haba in<br/>Germany in 20ies. His works are unknown to the Czech public now.<br/>Politically he was of course na&icirc;ve and wrong when he believed in<br/>bolshevism. Solzhenicyn describe in his history of Gulag many cases<br/>that sympatizant foreigners who came to Russia  were<br/>propagandistically disused and many of them disappeared in the hell<br/>of working camps with whole families. So if Schulhoff isn&apos;t killed by<br/>one totalitarian establishment, for sure he would be terminated in<br/>Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union like many others. (What more: there was not so<br/>much sympathy to Jewish people as well in SU despite the fact that<br/>some leading persons of KGB were Jewish.)  As a composer he was<br/>brilliant.</p><p>Karel Reiner (1910-1979), studied with Haba 1934-35, was not so<br/>famous as a composer, more as a theoretician, teacher and pianist<br/>(quartertone piano including), later also in Terezin and other camps,<br/>he was even selected to &quot;march of death&quot; but survived. Now he is<br/>almost forgotten.</p><p>Miroslav Ponc (1902-1976) was another very interesting and<br/>unfortunately in Czech Republic now almost forgotten artist, who did<br/>lot of incidental music for theatre, film and radio drama music, also<br/>early experiments with optophony, audiovisual art  and similar. He<br/>studied with Haba in 1934-35 as his exclusive student (lot of the<br/>other studied composition with different teachers, and  just visited<br/>Haba&apos;s lessons as a part of their study).</p><p>Stepan Lucky (1919-2006) studied with Haba 1946-48 (after 1948<br/>communistic regime closed Department of Quartetone Music), composed<br/>lot of incidental music for theatre, radio, film... Most of his works<br/>are tonal, traditional. I  found only one quartertone work on his<br/>list - Three Studies for quartertone piano.</p><p>Rudolf Kubin (1909-1973) studied with Haba 1925-26 has only few<br/>quartertone works, which is strange, he was another exclusive student<br/>of him.</p><p>Jaroslav Jezek (1906-1942) was heavily eye-handicapped, almost blind,<br/>but talented expressionistic composer and pianist. He studied with<br/>Haba in 1927-28. I don&apos;t know any of his microintervallic works, but<br/>until now he is very famous as an author of revual music and pop<br/>songs for theatre, inspired by American pop. His songs are in Czech<br/>Republic well know, almost like a part of folklore... On the other<br/>side his serious works are not performed at all.</p><p>Vaclav Dobias (1909-1978), with Haba in 1939-40, after his promissing<br/>avantguarde period he changed during the war his compositional stylewhich become totally conform and traditional. Which helped him to<br/>become one of the prominent composers of communistic regime after<br/>1948, he wrote mass propagandistic songs and similar works. He left<br/>only few quartertone works, his main idol was Bedrich Smetana (and<br/>Smetana has NO quartertone piece!), he returned to his style. He<br/>doesn&apos;t deserve to be mentioned. Such &quot;artists&quot; serving as political<br/>propaganda supporters should be forgotten. In fact recently his works<br/>are not performed, that way he got what he deserved. History has no<br/>mercy... sometimes...</p><p>Karel Ancerl was known more as a conductor, I didn&apos;t know at all he<br/>also composed...</p><p>There were more students, some deserve to be named:<br/>Miroslav Kabelac (1908-1979) - outstanding composer, studied with<br/>Haba 1930-31.</p><p>Karel Haba (1898-1972) - violinist and composer, brother of Alois,<br/>studied with him 1923-1925. Few quartertone works.</p><p>Jan Rychlik (1916-1964) - excellent composer, one of the most<br/>interesting Czech composers. Unfortunately not known.</p><p>Gideon Klein (1919-1945) - also Jewish origin, studied with Haba as<br/>his exclusive student 1939-40. He was as well in Terezin ghetto<br/>(1941-44), where he wrote few works, and then he met his fate in<br/>Ausschwitz.</p><p>After the WW II Haba established &quot;Department for Quartertone and<br/>Sixthtone Music&quot; even on Prague Music Academy (AMU), 1946-1950.</p><p>Haba published early book on microintervals:<br/>1922 - Harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove hudby (Harmonic Ground ofQuartertone Music), later in his own translation to German, which was<br/>revisited by E. Steinhard and publish under the title Neue<br/>Harmonielehre, Leipzig 1927<br/>This book you offered for download, thank you very much, I didn&apos;t<br/>have it (does it mean you can understand Czech?). Right now after<br/>downloading I have read it, it has just few pages and I have learned<br/>fast-reading mode in my childhood. It&apos;s full of very funny<br/>statements, and my opinion about his late-romantism esthetic starting<br/>point was only confirmed. On one side he started to use something<br/>very unusual, on the other side he used there such terms like<br/>kvintakord (triad), septakord (seventh chord) etc. until 13, that<br/>means totally traditional classical chord structure based on thirds,<br/>just with quartertone alterations of more or less notes... He talks<br/>even about &quot;modulation&quot; etc., which is funny in context with<br/>quartertone terrain. And musical examples, when you erase all<br/>incidentals, look like Schumann or Wagner (OK, Mahler) :-)</p><p>and article in German:<br/>Die Theorie der Viertelt&ouml;ne - Theory of Quartertones (1925 in &quot;Von<br/>neuer Musik&quot; - About New Music)</p><p>It was written somewhere that he found microintervals in Moravian<br/>folklore in region he was born and started to derive his theories<br/>from this &quot;scientific folklorism&quot;. I don&apos;t think so. If we compare<br/>with Janacek: Janacek learned from Moravian folklore many things,<br/>modality of Eastern, Byzantinian type in melodics, modal harmonic<br/>progressions older then Baroque/Classicism functional harmony,<br/>unusual chromatic jumps and modulations caused probably mainly by<br/>lack of &quot;academic&quot; knowledge of theory by uneducated folk performers,<br/>but mainly some elements of arrangement, tectonics (irregularity in<br/>period&apos;s and motifs length), rhythm (irregularity, or opposite -<br/>regular ostinato, motoric rhythms)... But why Janacek didn&apos;t used at<br/>all microintervalls? A man who used very exact scientific methods for<br/>folklore analysis didn&apos;t mention some microintervals? Who collected a<br/>lot of folk tunes? Such job asks very good hearing, no doubt Janacek<br/>had perfect pitch.<br/>I have simple answer. In Moravian music there are NOT intentional<br/>microintervals. If you hear some, then they are caused by bad quality<br/>and distuned instruments, lack of knowledge and playing skills by<br/>uneducated folk players, who are usually only music amateurs, even<br/>autodidacts without any higher formal music education, many of them<br/>&quot;help&quot; themselves during folk dancing parties with pretty good amount<br/>of pretty good Moravian wines or even stronger alcohol - no wonder<br/>music can be slightly out of tune, out of rhythm... Just my personal<br/>theory based on deep knowledge of Moravian folklore (and Moravian<br/>wine - I&apos;m half Moravian).</p><p>In my opinion the biggest problem of Haba was a great disproportion<br/>between his let&apos;s say proclaimed avantguardism (expressed in quite<br/>unusual composing with microintervals, and he used them not only in<br/>melodic sense but also for chords, OK, out of tune triads..., and I<br/>have to mention here his &quot;athematic style&quot;) and quite traditional<br/>compositional method based on folklorism, late romanticism wide<br/>tonality, partly cool boring panchromatic expressionism... If I am<br/>very sarcastic it can be said his music sound like Mahler, Strauss,<br/>Debussy, Rimskij-Korsakov played by more or less drunken performers<br/>with intentionally distuned instruments and singers (and to be REALLY<br/>sarcastic I would say singers don&apos;t need to be drunken, thay just can<br/>sing like they are used to). Totally common, conform music style,<br/>which is just somehow out of tune. :-)<br/>Such composers like Janacek, Bartok, Holst, Stravinski, even Debussy<br/>were in certain sense more far in compositional thinking despite the<br/>fact they could use standard tuning systems, common diatonic scales,<br/>modes, or chromatic... Their modernism is more in tectonics,<br/>microtectonics, work with meter, rhythm...  Just my opinion.</p><p>Another problem with Haba&apos;s music is that of course it&apos;s pretty tough<br/>job to perform it, and not well accepted from public as result is not<br/>nice sounding music even when done perfectly. There are recently no<br/>musicians educated in microtonal performing in Czech Republic, so his<br/>music is not performed at all. Consequently not newly recorded, and<br/>what I have heard and could judge with my perfect pitch, it&apos;s only a<br/>very approximative attempt to play his music. In fact it has nothing<br/>to do with exact quartertones or other systems, it&apos;s just music which<br/>is totally out of tune, that&apos;s all.</p><p>I can&apos;t help myself to add another point of criticism of Haba music:<br/>he used only equal temperaments, that means another divisions of<br/>imperfect 12 ET system. Which beauty we can expect from such<br/>mathematically exact system? Nor mathematical neither artistic... It<br/>just sounds terribly. I personally don&apos;t like quartertones despite<br/>the fact I used them more times, and consider them to be rather unpleasant for listening. So in my opinion it was a big mistake of<br/>Haba to use only such systems, and not do some steps in direction of<br/>just intervals or systems with steps of different size... Which is<br/>quite strange when we remember he started with folklorism and even<br/>said that he derived microintervals from folklore music. What a<br/>contradiction!</p><p>I don&apos;t think he wrote too much compositions - over 100. And about<br/>half of it are in quartertone system. That means approx. two works<br/>per year only...</p><p>What&apos;s interesting he was follower of Steiner&apos;s anthroposophy.</p><p>Concerning some of his instruments - during my study at Brno<br/>Janacek&apos;s Academy of Music after 1986 there was Haba&apos;s quartertone<br/>Foerster piano rented from Prague Museum, unfortunately later it<br/>disappeared, probably returned to the museum. When I started my work<br/>there as a teacher in 1990, it was not to find. Haba wrote in his<br/>book that president Masaryk supported Haba&apos;s work and granted him<br/>big amount of money to build this piano.</p><p>Fate of his sixthtone harmonium with six small manuals is sad as<br/>well: this instrument was during my Conservatory study of pipe organ<br/>and composition (1973-1979) deposited in organ classroom, somewhere<br/>in dark corner behind the school organ, full of dust, nobody used it<br/>and it slowly started to become a ruin. I remember still my surprise<br/>to find it there, nobody knew any details about it, I liked to<br/>improvise on it sometimes, it still worked. (Maybe here my interest<br/>in microintervals started, who knows...) When after political changes<br/>in 1989 it was possible to ask such questions, and I wanted to buy<br/>the ruin, restore it and use, I was told it was destroyed. Such<br/>ignorant idiots were on important leading places before 1989, and<br/>they could do such decisions... What a pity. (I&apos;m afraid situation<br/>now doesn&apos;t differ too much...)</p><p>Sorry for rather too long message, I couldn&apos;t resist.</p><p>Have a nice day.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 24 Sep 2008, at 4:18 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; __<br/>&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; __<br/>&gt; 4. harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove soustavy<br/>&gt;     Posted by: &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&gt; daniel_anthony_stearns@... daniel_anthony_stearns<br/>&gt;     Date: Tue Sep 23, 2008 4:36 pm ((PDT))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alois Haba was an early microtonalist and a proponent of various<br/>&gt; fractional divisions of the octave . Few articles would serve as a<br/>&gt; better introduction to Haba than this one:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6xpmo9">http://tinyurl.com/6xpmo9</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought the bit in about Haba&apos;s ascension to professorship at the<br/>&gt; Prague Conservatory was very interesting... for ten years Haba taught<br/>&gt; at the Conservatory on the basis of an annually renewed permission to<br/>&gt; hold &quot;courses in microtonal music&quot;-------&gt;microtonal music was not a<br/>&gt; separate subject in the curriculum, but was considered a department<br/>&gt; of the composition class and could only be taken by students who had<br/>&gt; already taken the required composition subjects. It wasn&apos;t until 1934<br/>&gt; that Haba was appointed a professor of composition at the<br/>&gt; Conservatory. Among his many students, several of whom went on to<br/>&gt; produce and promote fractional interval music themselves, were<br/>&gt; Ljubica Maric, Jeronimas Kacinskas, Viktor Ullmann, Slavko Osterc,<br/>&gt; Constantin Iliev, Jiri Srnka, Necil Kazim Akses, Erwin Schulhoff,<br/>&gt; Karel Reiner, Miroslav Ponc, Stepan Lucky, Rudolf Kubin, Jaroslav<br/>&gt; Jezek, Vaclav Dobias, Karel Ancerl, and many, many others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haba composed an awful lot of quarter-tone music, including a full<br/>&gt; quarter-tone opera, Matka, and six string quartets (nos. 2, 3, 4, 6,<br/>&gt; 12 and 14), six suites, eleven fantasies and a sonata for piano, and<br/>&gt; two suites for guitar. Haba also composed pieces using other<br/>&gt; fractional divisions of the tone, like string quartet no. 16 in fifth-<br/>&gt; tones, and string quartets (nos. 5, 10 and 11) and suites for solo<br/>&gt; violin and cello in sixth-tones. Unfortunately, almost all of Haba&apos;s<br/>&gt; recordings are very difficult to find and usually quite expensive as<br/>&gt; well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haba, like Carrillo in Mexico, was also influential enough to managed<br/>&gt; to have special microtonal instruments made to his specifications.<br/>&gt; For example, the piano manufacturer A. Forster built a quarter-tone<br/>&gt; piano and a sixth-tone harmonium at his request. He also convinced<br/>&gt; other manufactures to make him a quarter-tone clarinet and trumpet,<br/>&gt; and later a quarter-tone guitar. Haba also wrote two important<br/>&gt; microtonal textbooks, Neue Harmonielehre des diatonischen,<br/>&gt; chromatischen, Viertel-, Drittel-, Sechstel-, und Zwolfteltonsystems<br/>&gt; and Harmonicke zaklady ctvrttonove soustavy. FWIW, I have the latter<br/>&gt; of these in Czech transferred to PDF at yousendit, and I&apos;d be happy<br/>&gt; to share it with anyone who&apos;d be interested:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4cbtuj">http://tinyurl.com/4cbtuj</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s also, of course, striking what a dark time in the development of<br/>&gt; the modern psyche this whole period was set in, and the unimaginable<br/>&gt; consequences it brought about. Just out of the very small and<br/>&gt; particular group of composers I mentioned here as former students of<br/>&gt; Haba, two were killed in the concentration camps; Viktor Ullmann and<br/>&gt; Erwin Schulhoff. After the Nazi seizure of Czechoslavakia, Ullmann<br/>&gt; was sent to Theresienstadt, where he somehow manager to compose a one-<br/>&gt; act opera, Der Kaiser von Atlantis, which was based on a tyrannical<br/>&gt; monarch who outlaws death only to later beg for its return to relieve<br/>&gt; humanity from the horrors of living. He later died, most likely at<br/>&gt; Auschwitz. Schulhoff was a member of the communist party, and after<br/>&gt; the Nazi occupation in 1939 was granted Soviet citizenship to protect<br/>&gt; him from arrest. But after the 1941 Nazi invasion of Russia, he was<br/>&gt; arrested and later died in the concentration camps. Others, like<br/>&gt; Stephan Lucky (detained at Terezin, Dachau, and Auschwitz) and Karel<br/>&gt; Reiner (detained at Bucharest, Auschwitz and Buchenwald) miraculously<br/>&gt; survived and even composed again after liberation.
