I remember hearing that the kit worked rather well for nylon-string guitar, but I&apos;m looking for opinions on the sound of high-quality steel-string acoustic guitars with the interchangeable fingerboards.</p><p>Though I find nylon-string guitars easier to play, chords such as higher-limit Utonal chords sound much better to me on the steel-string acoustic guitar than on any other instrument. Probably sympathetic vibrations among the higher harmonics have something to do with that.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=28517 href="#28517">ðŸ”—</a>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2001 7:03:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 9/22/01 4:52 AM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 12<br/>&gt; Date: 21 Sep 2001 16:35:56 -0700<br/>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;m planning to order Mark Rankin&apos;s Interchangeable Fingerboard kit,<br/>&gt; preferably to install 22-tET, 31-tET, MIRACLE (with standard 12-tET tuning of<br/>&gt; open strings), and Shrutar frettings (though I may change my mind on some of<br/>&gt; these) on a steel-string acoustic guitar.
