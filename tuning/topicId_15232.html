I should have made it clear that I wasn&apos;t really interested in<br/>viewing it as a stretched tuning, particularly.  I just wasn&apos;t sure<br/>whether I understood your first explanation so I thought of a way to<br/>restate it as a question.  It sounds very intersting and possibly<br/>promising.</p><p>David Finnamore</p></div>
