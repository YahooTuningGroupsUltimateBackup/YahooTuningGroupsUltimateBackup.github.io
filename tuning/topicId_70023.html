I&apos;ve ordered a score through interlibrary loan, but it will take a couple of weeks to arrive and the student is eager to get started soon. If someone (Monz?) had a score that they could scan and email just a few pages of (one etude), that could tide the student over until the full score arrives. (I&apos;ll be sure to make a copy of the score to share afterwards.)</p><p>Please be in touch privately if you can help out. In case yahoo is munging addresses in the headers, mine is wild ^AT^ music ^DOT^ mcgill ^DOT^ ca.</p><p>Many thanks --Jon Wild</p></div>
