Paul you should have done it the other way! Set up a new group<br/>&gt; called &quot;no-math-tuning&quot; and invite everyone who thinks they can<br/>&gt; discuss tuning without math, to go there.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree, and in-fact, that list exists and is called<br/>practicalmicrotonality. Tuning List classic&apos; can stay with its &apos;focus&apos;<br/>and spawn sublists when a particular topic gets so heavy as to require<br/>a new list. Although this has only happened with Harmonic Entropy, I<br/>can see it happenning with &quot;tuning-programming&quot; topics or<br/>&quot;tuning-spirituality&quot; specific topics.</p><p>Not that I think it ever had to, but...</p><p>re: Gary Morrisons points. There have been a LOT of posts about music,<br/>usually put on the net somewhere as mp3 or midi files. There was a<br/>poster named Lars who was doing a lot of this. Perhaps they<br/>don&apos;t lead to as much discussion. Usually its something along the lines<br/>of &quot;wow, that was great, how did you record it&quot;, or &quot;my patches are<br/>lousy and what is the pitchbend supposed to be set to?&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t have a lot of time for downloading non-text, nor am I<br/>particularly equipped to deal with audio data (or HTML data which<br/>may have been what blew up my email and made me lose about 40 digests<br/>from the four tuning related lists I am now subscribed to). I<br/>buy CDs though...</p><p>I suppose this was a meta thing, and that all I&apos;ve done was beat a<br/>dead horse to death, but I could not find that or any other new<br/>groups at Yahoo.</p><p>Re another post of mine... are</p><p> BBBBaaa              BBBBBaa<br/> BBBaBaa              BBBBaBa<br/> BBBaaBa              BBBaBBa x<br/> BBaBBaa<br/> BBaBaBa x</p><p>really ALL the unique seven note diatonic sets (not counting<br/>rotations?. (I&apos;ve marked those that are &quot;one step transposable&quot;<br/>with an x).</p><p>What is the quick way I would have found the number</p><p>    &apos;8&apos;</p><p>from</p><p>    seven notes<br/>    two step sizes</p><p>or, what is the formula that I would divide by 14 at the end to<br/>eliminate rotations and whether B or a is larger?</p><p>Re : thread launched with my name about neutral thirds, I am<br/>honored but unworthy. I&apos;ll try to piece together some of that<br/>data sometime and figure out if I can create the perceptual<br/>difference for myself. I will probably look at it in the<br/>context of the 7ED2 approximation in 31ED2</p><p>  4     5    4   5    4     5    4<br/>0    4     9   13  18   22    27   31<br/>1/1 11/10 11/9 4/3 3/2 18/11 20/11 2/1<br/>    12/11              44/27 11/6</p><p>just to show some of what it represents. Of course, since the<br/>oddball is a pretty good 6:5, it may be hard to make all the<br/>11:9&apos;s sound like diferent thirds, but interesting...</p><p>Anyone experienced with this scale feel free to comment...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
