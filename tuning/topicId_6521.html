This is set<br/>per pattern, so ea. pattern could be setup for different 16-note tunings.<br/>Never mind Yamaha&apos;s misguided efforts to market this machine as a competitor<br/>to Roland&apos;s &quot;groovebox&quot; toyz. I&apos;ve read the manual &amp; think it&apos;s the most<br/>powerful hardware sequencer on the planet. Lots of esoteric functions u<br/>wouldn&apos;t think a major corporation would stick in a commercial product.</p><p>Info (very basic):<br/><a href="http://www.yamaha.co.uk/synth/html/current/midiseq/d_rm1x.htm">http://www.yamaha.co.uk/synth/html/current/midiseq/d_rm1x.htm</a></p><p>also :<br/><a href="http://www.yamaha.com/cgi-win/webcgi.exe/DsplyModel/?gSEQ00005RM1X">http://www.yamaha.com/cgi-win/webcgi.exe/DsplyModel/?gSEQ00005RM1X</a></p><p>For a real look at it&apos;s capabilities :</p><p>Owner&apos;s Manual : 6.4MB<br/><a href="http://www.yamaha.co.uk/eurohome/library/rm1x/rm1xe1.pdf">http://www.yamaha.co.uk/eurohome/library/rm1x/rm1xe1.pdf</a></p><p>&quot;List Book&quot; - Gives a list of voices, effects, parameters,<br/>MIDI implementation chart, including SysEx : 462KB<br/><a href="http://www.yamaha.co.uk/eurohome/library/rm1x/rm1xe2.pdf">http://www.yamaha.co.uk/eurohome/library/rm1x/rm1xe2.pdf</a></p><p>I think most of u will be very surprised at the power this has.<br/>Yamaha does a poor job of marketing it, complete with dumbass web pages with<br/>barely any useful info.</p><p>Unfortunately, though it has a capable XG synth built in, they left out the<br/>scale tuning function for some reason. C&apos;est la vie !<br/>Still, great for @US$680 retail.</p><p>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Thousands of Stores.  Millions of Products.
