Suppose you have a chord of, let&apos;s say, 7:8:9:10:11:12:13:14 in one scale (i.e. the 7 ratios from 8/7 to 2/1). Then you widen all the intervals except the final one by, for example, 5 cents -- i.e. 2/1 doesn&apos;t become 1205 cents but all the rest is 5 cents wider -- and save this as your second scale. Then one would expect the synth/sampler/whatever to keep the same pitches for both the 2/1 and the &quot;self-implied&quot; 1/1 in both scales. Surprisingly, it&apos;s the other way round -- i.e. the entire pitch is 5 cents lower in the second case, which means that the 8:9:10:11:12:13 now sound the same, though the second scale should set them 5 cents higher than the first, and the 2/1 and 1/1 change to 1195 cents and -5 cents, respectively.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=90206 href="#90206">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 3:37:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Torsten wrote :</p><p>&gt; I recently tried the microtonal possibiities of PianoTeq myself.

As I said, perhaps doing instruments like the veena justice in tuning is difficult due to its resonance strings, I don&apos;t know.
