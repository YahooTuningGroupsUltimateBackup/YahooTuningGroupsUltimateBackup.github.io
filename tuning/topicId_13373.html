In other timbres, this varies widely. In a clarinet tone, the<br/>odd-numbered harmonics are louder, on a flute the even-numbered harmonics.<br/>Don&apos;t know about voices.</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2000 10:09:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anybody know the approximate relative amplitudes of<br/>&gt; the partials in a &quot;typical&quot; harmonic timbre (say, a vocal<br/>&gt; &quot;ah&quot;)?  Are they inversely proportional to their position<br/>&gt; in the series?  Or do they drop off more quickly?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Arthur H.Benade&apos;s &apos;Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics&apos; discusses the voice as a musical<br/>&gt; instrument. I quote page 369  where he gives the recipe for a typical intermediate voice<br/>&gt; sound in ordinary speech   &quot; The amplitude An of the nth harmonic partial is primarily<br/>&gt; related to the fundamental amplitude A1 by the formula An = a1/n squared&quot;, with a few<br/>&gt; weakened partials.</p><p>&gt; He then elaborates by explaining that the ears themselves have progressively greater<br/>&gt; sensitivities for high frequencies (up to about 3500 Hz ) than for lower frequencies and<br/>&gt; considers &quot;the loudnesses of individual voice partials that someone would perceive if they<br/>&gt; came to his ear one by one, on the assumption that he is listening only a short distance<br/>&gt; away from the mouth of the singer.&quot;  Interestingly, the &apos;loudness recipes&apos; for two different<br/>&gt; sung pitches both show peaks of loudness at the 7th, 11th and 26th partials.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not qualified to offer further analysis.  I found Benade&apos;s book at Amazon. I hope this<br/>&gt; helps.</p><p>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2000 12:10:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Does anybody know the approximate relative amplitudes of<br/>&gt; the partials in a &quot;typical&quot; harmonic timbre (say, a vocal<br/>&gt; &quot;ah&quot;)?
