The 144-tET modification on<br/>the other hand was simply an attempt on my part to globally up the<br/>ante (so to speak) of 72&apos;s already doable approximation of the pitch<br/>continuum with a minimum of additional notational complexity. My<br/>reasoning was that those who could already tackle the 72-tET notation<br/>could then approach the modified glyphs much as most performers tend<br/>to approach the various varieties of quartertone notations: as a note<br/>approximately halfway between one familiar note and another... 144-tET<br/>precisely rendered definitely wasn&apos;t the point.</p><p>As Joe Monzo pointed out, some (notably Paul Erlich) would see this as<br/>a bad idea in the sense that it (depending on how it&apos;s used) could<br/>easily sabotage 72-tET&apos;s impressive consistency. And as a brief note<br/>on this -- in case your puzzling over the significance of that -- I<br/>would say that consistency can be seen as both the measure of how far<br/>and how well a given ET goes towards representing only the best<br/>approximations of relative consonant intervals. So when one says that<br/>a given equal temperament is consistent through a given odd-limit,<br/>72-tET is consistent through the 17 odd-limit and 144-tET is<br/>consistent through the 11 odd-limit, it means that every interval or<br/>intervallic rotation of that odd-limit will always be represented by<br/>its best rounded [(LOG(N)-LOG(D))*(T/LOG(2))] representations were &quot;N&quot;<br/>and &quot;D&quot; are the numerator and the denominator of the relevant<br/>consonant intervals, and &quot;T&quot; is the temperament. So using 72 and<br/>144-tET as examples, 72 is consistent through the 17 odd-limit,<br/>meaning that all occurrences of the 1:3:5:7:9:11:13:15:17 -- and this<br/>is easily seen when one rotates the identity, or given odd-limit:</p><p>1/1 17/16 9/8   5/4   11/8  3/2   13/8  7/4   15/8<br/>1/1 18/17 20/17 22/17 24/17 26/17 28/17 30/17 32/17<br/>1/1 10/9  11/9  4/3   13/9  14/9  5/3   16/9  17/9<br/>1/1 11/10 6/5   13/10 7/5   3/2   8/5   17/10 9/5<br/>1/1 12/11 13/11 14/11 15/11 16/11 17/11 18/11 20/11<br/>1/1 13/12 7/6   5/4   4/3   17/12 3/2   5/3   11/6<br/>1/1 14/13 15/13 16/13 17/13 18/13 20/13 22/13 24/13<br/>1/1 15/14 8/7   17/14 9/7   10/7  11/7  12/7  13/7<br/>1/1 16/15 17/15 6/5   4/3   22/15 8/5   26/15 28/15</p><p>will always be represented by their best [(LOG(N)-LOG(D))*(T/LOG(2))]<br/>representations were T=72. Now 144-tET is consistent through the 11<br/>odd-limit, so while 144-tET&apos;s 13/8, 15/8, and 17/8<br/>(LOG(N)-LOG(D))*(t/LOG(2)) approximations are all better, or rather<br/>nearer in cents, than those of 72-tET, using these &quot;better&quot;<br/>approximations would conversely lead to other multiple, or<br/>*inconsistent* representations of relevant consonances -- hence the<br/>term inconsistency (I would imagine). A simple example of all this in<br/>action would be the major seventh chord in 72-tET and 144-tET were you<br/>are considering the 8:15 to be a consonance, i.e., a best rounded<br/>[(LOG(N)-LOG(D))*(T/LOG(2))] representation:</p><p>  23----65        46---131<br/>  / \.&apos; /         / \.&apos; /<br/> /.&apos; \ /         /.&apos; \ /<br/>0----42         0----84</p><p>Note the multiple 2:3s in the 144-tET example? The 85/144ths of an<br/>octave ~2:3 between the 4:5 and the 8:15 is the inconsistency.<br/>Hopefully this at least gives you some idea of the potential<br/>situations that can arise; or perhaps you already knew! For a variety<br/>of reasons I don&apos;t place nearly the importance on this here that Paul<br/>does, though I can see why others would, and it can&apos;t hurt to at least<br/>be cognizant of it and its potential compositional (or especially JI<br/>arrangement) ramifications.</p><p>&gt; Maybe I&apos;m the only person on this list concerned with this, but I<br/>REALLY AM interested in the response and evolution of the &quot;average&quot;<br/>concert musician in xenharmonic musics.</p><p>Well I would still have to think that most any microtonal notation<br/>,save maybe quartertones (maybe), still falls most soundly into the<br/>laps of &quot;specialized&quot; performers (OK, specialized performers and rash<br/>adventures...).</p><p>rash adventurers unite,</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2000 9:20:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12234">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12234</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thing to try and bear in mind here Joe is that there already is<br/>a preexisting 72 &quot;school&quot;; in other words, proof and testimony of its<br/>&gt; doability already exists... it&apos;s airborne!</p><p>Well, I have heard some of this.

This is not unlike<br/>using cents-values to indicate JI pitches, but the cents-values<br/>are more accurate.</p><p>I can concede that in some ways using cents-values makes more<br/>sense  ;-)   Here&apos;s the argument:</p><p>In the Stearns 144-tET notation, there are 9 different symbols:</p><p>4 pairs (which form the 72-tET basis):</p><p># and b for 1/2-tones  = 100     cents<br/>^ and v for 1/4-tones  =  50     cents<br/>&gt; and &lt; for 1/6-tones  =  33.1/3 cents<br/>+ and - for 1/12-tones =  16.2/3 cents</p><p>and the ~ to mitigate the action of any of the above by 50%,<br/>indicating any of the 1/24-tone (8.1/3-cent) inflections that<br/>fall between any of the above.  The ~ only appears accompanying<br/>one of the 8 pairs of symbols above, and incorporates the<br/>directional logic of the symbol with which it is used; the ~<br/>is a &apos;mitigator&apos; of the action indicated by the &apos;main&apos; symbol.</p><p>For example, if C is our reference tone of 0 cents, E~v indicates<br/>a pitch 1/24-tone above the 1/4-tone below E, or 358.1/3 cents.</p><p>In the simplest version of the cents system, there are 10 different<br/>symbols: the digits 0 to 9.  In combination with the 12 pitches<br/>of the 12-tET chromatic scale, this would suffice to indicate any<br/>pitch to within 1 cent.  You&apos;d need only one, not both, of either<br/># or b, to indicate the 12 different pitches.  Similarly, the cents<br/>would indicate an adjustment in either the sharp or flat direction,<br/>but not both.  So altogether there are 11 different symbols.<br/>If you use *both* # and b with the cents system, that&apos;s 12 symbols.</p><p>But this is not the most common way the cents system is used.<br/>Most often, I&apos;ve seen + or - cents applied to the chromatic<br/>pitches.  So now we&apos;re up to 13 different symbols, and we&apos;re<br/>incorporating the kind of directional logic that the 144-tET<br/>system uses with less symbols.  See where I&apos;m going with this?</p><p>Admittedly, it&apos;s something like comparing apples and oranges,<br/>because the cents system takes advantage of our ability to<br/>use the decimal place-holder system of calculation to make<br/>the 10 digital symbols represent 100 discrete measurements,<br/>whereas each of the symbols in 144-tET has one specific meaning<br/>(imagine writing cents-values in Roman numerals!). So the ratio<br/>of accuracy to symbol-complexity is much higher in the cents<br/>system.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s some more to think about regarding 144-tET.<br/>I find it a useful guide or approximation to JI.</p><p>And Dan Stearns likes 144-tET notation because he finds it<br/>a useful systematic approximation to the *simulatenous* use of<br/>many different smaller ETs, which is often how Johnny uses<br/>the cents system.</p><p>Also, I wanted to chime in that I think 24-tET notation is<br/>a wonderful notation for breaking the bonds of 12-tET and<br/>approximating a whole new universe of microtonal pitches.<br/>I know Paul Erlich strongly disagrees, because 12-tET scores<br/>much higher marks in the consistency game, but still, in its<br/>use as a *notational approximation*, I find it useful.</p><p>And Joe, if you insist that staff-notation must be retatained,<br/>what do you think about prime-factor notation?

I believe I reference<br/>it in my paper.</p><p>My system and Wolf&apos;s were both reactions against, and hopefully<br/>improvements upon, the 5-limit-based JI notation of Ben Johnston.<br/>You can find articles about that in _Perspectives of New Music_.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2000 5:10:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joe,</p><p>Back when you first started this discussion in the middle of<br/>last week, I sent a post<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12067">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12067</a></p><p>wherein I provided links to earlier discussions we had about<br/>this from last year.</p><p>One of those old posts:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/2362">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/2362</a></p><p>is the one where I laid out the entire 144-tET &apos;8ve&apos;.</p><p>It seems that perhaps you missed this message from last week<br/># 12067); take a look - it will give you a lot more debate to<br/>consider.</p><p>Remember that *any* notation, whether its describing music,<br/>language, or whatever, is less precise than the actual data!<br/>Things in the real world seem to happen in an analog fashion,<br/>and our notations, codes, symbols, etc., can only work in<br/>a digital format!  We can only describe coded information in<br/>discrete &apos;bits&apos;.</p><p>This is a big aprt of the reason why I keep arguing that<br/>notations and tunings are two different things, and that<br/>musicians can learn to cope with the inevitable inadequacies<br/>of a notational system.  Look at how Partch handled it!<br/>His notations are all tablatures which cannot be understood<br/>without intimate knowledge of the instruments themselves.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/3/2000 6:34:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12268">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12268</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back when you first started this discussion in the middle of<br/>&gt; last week, I sent a post<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12067">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12067</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; wherein I provided links to earlier discussions we had about<br/>&gt; this from last year.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Monz...</p><p>Yes, I did study your post carefully, but the only links I didn&apos;t<br/>really go totally through were the ones concerning notation.
