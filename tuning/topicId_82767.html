If one uses a semi-augmented fourth (or a semi-diminished fifth) and the other uses a neutral third as a generator, then the only possible situation where they could both temper out the same intervals migh be when the actual generator in one temperament splits the generator of the other into an integer number of parts (like othra or squares which both contain meantone or like superpelog which contains mavila). For one thing, the 2006 tuning doesn&apos;t do 11s while the 2008 tuning doesn&apos;t do 7s. For another thing, 5s are mapped to -8 generators in the one from 2008 (if I use a generator of a tempered 11/8 instead of 16/11) and -9 generators in the one from 2006.</p><p>&gt; When telling us about your music, I&apos;d love it if you<br/>&gt; reported the mapping as well as the generator size(s).</p><p>Okay, even though I seem to only rarely come up with something new to the TL members (which I realized after rediscovering semisixths, hanson, hedgehog, tetracot, orwell, and rodan), this is what I can say about the three temperaments we&apos;re discussing, in order of used prime limits, mappings, and selected generator sizes:<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/><a href="http://2.5.7.13">2.5.7.13</a>:<br/>[(1, 0), (5, -9), (4, -4), (4, -1)]<br/>357.076254<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/><a href="http://2.5.11.13">2.5.11.13</a>:<br/>[(1, 0), (6, -8), (3, 1), (6, -5)]<br/>551.781433<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/><a href="http://2.5.11.13">2.5.11.13</a>:<br/>[(1, 0, 0), (3, -1, -1), (3, -1, 2), (4, -1, 0)]<br/>358.999861, 455.158902<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Although I prefer to describe the 2008 temperament using a tempered 16/11 rather than 11/8 because then you need a smaller number of periods for the important approximations.</p><p>&gt; 87-ET has excellent fifths. And it looks like you<br/>&gt; get 37-ET if you add 7s instead.</p><p>In my mailbox on my laptop, there&apos;s a message entitled &quot;A case of 37-EDO&quot; which I was apparently posting to the TL on the May 23rd, 2006. There I was talking about exactly these interesting properties of 37-equal.</p><p>&gt; Are most of your keyboard mappings 12-tone ones?</p><p>Yes, most of them are, just because I want to have a chance to play the scales live, to have them at my finger tips. The only cases when I can&apos;t play them &quot;live&quot; are scales of more than 12 tones, which means I have to tune different MIDI channels to different parts of the scale. But I usually try, in situations like these, to get as much as I can on a single MIDI channel (like making a 16-tone scale by using 12 tones on one channel and 4 tones on another instead of, let&apos;s say, 8 and 8), which allows me to record a substantial portion of the chords on one track and then only add a few more notes on another. For example, the pieces I called &quot;Run Down The Whistle 3&quot; and &quot;Still Differently&quot; are both in 5-limit semisixths. But when I wanted to include a comma pump there, I realized I had to use at least a 16-tone set to do that. And I can tell you, it was a pretty difficult thing to play, in both cases. But because I knew the exact pitches I was looking for, at first, I was singing or whistling the tones which weren&apos;t in the 12-tone set to fill in the &quot;gaps&quot; in my mind, and after recording a few measures of the passage, I added the second track where I used only 4 tones so it wasn&apos;t so difficult for me to find them. In this particular case, what I did was take a 12-tone set of semisixths and tuned the second MIDI channel to the inversion of the first one. You can imagine something similar by, for example, getting a meantone chain from Bbb to D on one channel and from D to F## on another, with the difference that this was semisixths and not meantone but the method is the same. So there was one tpitch in common on both channels. Although this allowed me to use as much as 23 tones in the scale, I used only 16. And the one tone which had the same pitch on both channels helped me not only to find the necessary pitches while recording the second track, but also to appropriately tune the scale even with the limitations of the +/-63-cent maximum; I&apos;ll tell you something, I was using pitch-bends to have the same pitch on the &quot;central&quot; key while allowing different tuning offsets for the key on each channel, which meant, of course, that I couldn&apos;t use pitch-bends for melodic ornamentation. But when I was experimenting with this in 2002, I solved the problem by setting the channel aftertouch parameter to change the pitch.</p><p>&gt; You have an uncanny knack for finding your way around extended<br/>&gt; temperaments on the keyboard. Tell us your secret! Do<br/>&gt; you mark keys with tape, work out fingerings for chords<br/>&gt; on paper, do it all in your head? Or do you just<br/>&gt; improvise without trying to find particular chords?</p><p>Wow, thanks: :-) -- Well, for many temperaments, I carefully read the interval sizes when making them in Scala, which helps me a lot to know which key maps to which interval. And then, what follows is just about 5 to 10 minutes of practicing, and I get it.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2009 1:09:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr wrote:</p><p>&gt; Although I prefer to describe the 2008 temperament using a<br/>&gt; tempered 16/11 rather than 11/8 because then you need a<br/>&gt; smaller number of periods for the important approximations.</p><p>Can&apos;t we just say we will remember to apply the 11/8 generator<br/>downward from the unison?</p><p>Care to have a stab at naming this temperament?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Are most of your keyboard mappings 12-tone ones?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, most of them are, just because I want to have a chance<br/>&gt; to play the scales live, to have them at my finger tips.</p><p>Some folks map &gt; 12 tones to the keyboard and just play<br/>chords with two hands.

Have you considered using your QS-300<br/>as a MIDI controller for softsynths running on your PC?<br/>Then you could have &gt; 12 notes/octave.
