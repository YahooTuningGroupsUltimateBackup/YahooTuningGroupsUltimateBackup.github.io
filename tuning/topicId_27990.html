I would suggest<br/>doing it by moving along the line from one tuning system to another,<br/>in the space defined by the tunings of the primes.</p><p>For instance if n3, n5, n7, and n11 are the tuning in cents of 3,<br/>5,7, and 11 in the 22-et, the line to the 31-et in parametric form is<br/>(n3 - 12.3t, n5 + 5.3t, n7 - 14.1t, n11 - 3.5t), where when t=0 we<br/>have the 22-et and when t=1 we have the 31-et. We could also try<br/>stopping over at just intonation on the way; from the 22-et to JI we<br/>would go (n3 - 7.1t, n5 + 4.5t, n7 - 13t, n11 + 5.9t); except for 11<br/>the JI values are more or less on the way from 22 to 31.</p><p>We could also move octaves while adapting. If we use the Gram tuning<br/>for the 22-et, octaves are 1198.64689 cents, and if we call the<br/>values we get for the 11-limit primes m2,m3,m5,m7 and m11, the line<br/>from the 22-et Gram tuning to JI is given by<br/>(m2 + 1.4t, m3 - 5t, m5 + 7.6t, m7 - 9.2t, m11 + 10.5t).</p></div><h3><a id=28021 href="#28021">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2001 2:07:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; Suppose you have identified a certain passage as one that used a<br/>&gt; particular appproximation.

The 12,22,<br/>and 31 ets taken together are a notation for the 5-limit, so if you<br/>know how you want a piece to sound in all three scales and what the<br/>result in the 5-limit you are done.

If in three of the<br/>systems things seem to be working well, but in one we have a problem,<br/>then we could temper that system out of the mix.
