I have no skill in math (though<br/>the numbers relate to chords I compose with), so this is probably<br/>just hokus pocus number mysticism...but just in case there&apos;s<br/>something to it.</p><p>I recall the importance of odd numbers (and primes) in &apos;lattice<br/>theory&apos; etc discussed here, and noticed that counting numbers and odd<br/>numbers give triangular numbers in the following manner: 3x1=3,<br/>3x2=6; 5x2=10, 5x3=15; 7x3=21, 7x4=28; et cetera.</p><p>Since the above thread was about the recipricals of counting numbers<br/>(the harmonic series) and the recipricals of triangle numbers, I<br/>thought I would mention it.  (And naturally, the fact that each odd<br/>number is repeated twice in the progression, reflects a connection to<br/>the first series converging on 2...just kidding...)</p><p>Kelly</p></div><h3><a id=55797 href="#55797">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2004 2:35:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; &lt;kj4321@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I recall the importance of odd numbers (and primes) in &apos;lattice<br/>&gt; theory&apos; etc discussed here, and noticed that counting numbers and odd<br/>&gt; numbers give triangular numbers in the following manner: 3x1=3,<br/>&gt; 3x2=6; 5x2=10, 5x3=15; 7x3=21, 7x4=28; et cetera.</p><p>The formula for the nth triangular number (which you can use the same<br/>method of indiction to prove as Robert used) is n(n+1)/2; since either<br/>n or n+1 is an even number, you get the pattern you observed.</p><p>The formula for the nth tetrahedronal number is n(n+1)(n+2)/6; you can<br/>amuse yourself by finding what the sum of its reciprocals comes to.<br/>It&apos;s strange but true that these infinite series are easy to sum, but<br/>reciprocals of powers lead into deeper waters.
