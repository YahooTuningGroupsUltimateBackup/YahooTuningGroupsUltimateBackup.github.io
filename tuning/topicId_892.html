Whitney is/was a neo-Pythagorean who thinks whole number<br/>ratios are visually perceptible as well as audible. His abstract films<br/>have a very perceptible compositional structure -- at one time David<br/>Rothenberg considered writing a &apos;grammar&apos; for one of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, Whitney does not discuss his early work with war-surplus<br/>mechanical analog computers and linked pendulums in this book. He or his<br/>brother also used the pendulums to create electronic music (called<br/>Pendulum Music), some of which accompanied a production of  three plays<br/>by the science-fiction and fantasy writer Ray Bradbury in the 60&apos;s in<br/>LA.</p><p>Ivor Darreg (under the name of Drarreg) collaborated with the Whitney&apos;s<br/>to some extent in the late 50&apos;s or early 60&apos;s. John&apos;s sons Michael and<br/>John attended UCSD as undergraduates in the 60&apos;s.</p><p>Whitney&apos;s work and approach definitely has xenharmonic implications -- I<br/>recommend looking into it.</p><p>--John</p></div>
