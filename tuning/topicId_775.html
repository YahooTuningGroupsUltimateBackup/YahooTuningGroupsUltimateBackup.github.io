They are the colorful<br/>sea slugs they got in them tide pools down in La Jolla?<br/>Some of the big purple ones weigh several pounds.</p><p>Sometimes called sea cows since they &apos;graze&apos; on the<br/>grass.</p><p>They have got the largest neurons ever found so<br/>neurobiologists use them for testing and their &apos;brain&apos;<br/>such as it is is the only one that has been fully<br/>mapped -- all 87 neurons or whatever # it is.</p><p>Anyway, does any one know much about their mating<br/>habits?</p><p>Also, info on mating habits of other mollusks would be<br/>helpful as well as any advance warnings on any<br/>contentious issues involved in this field of study. I<br/>wonder if the conches have to come out of their shells<br/>to mate or how that works...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jeff</p></div>
