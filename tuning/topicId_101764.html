You can either use the value of the last iteration, or add the value of all iterations together, the later gives a more complex sound which is what i used for most of the examples in the sound file.</p><p>This algorithm works with &quot;inside&quot; points only. This makes it rather limited, because not only is it limited to straight lines that contain inside pixels only, but most of them don&apos;t even give any audible result, for example the main bulb of the Mandelbrot set. There are only a few certain areas that have anything going on with them to give a audible result. Most of the samples i did are either of the &quot;antenna&quot; on the real axis of the Mandelbrot set, or the Julia sets from it. I would try with the power of 3 Mandelbrot, but i can&apos;t find a formula for it anywhere!</p><p>I also tried the &quot;Mandelbar&quot; and &quot;Burning Ship&quot; variants, but since these are the same for real numbers anyway, there&apos;s not much point to it.</p><p>There is one other formula i used however, which is the first one you hear in the sound example. That is simply a nested sine function, instead of squaring, with multiplication increasing with time. I included this because it was my first idea, and i think it&apos;s somewhat related to the Mandelbrot/Juilia formula.</p><p>I kind of imagined this having potential to be developed as a purpose made app, that lets you choose a path graphically along the M or J-set along with the other parameters, to render into audio. However upon trying this i have to conclude that there really isn&apos;t much more to find, than what is included in this sound file.</p><p>For those who really wonder, the ones that sound somewhat repetive are Julia sets from the real axis, the one that is just a single sliding pitch is -2 if i remember right, while the Mandelbrot ones sound more chaotic. Of course the difference between the &quot;Julia&quot; or &quot;Mandelbrot&quot; here is just what parameter is changed over the course of time!</p><p>But what really surprises me is how similar the results sound to sine waves, sometimes phase/frequency modulated sine waves. Is there a obvious relation between the squaring formula and the sine function that i&apos;ve missed?</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2011 11:13:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mats &Atilde;ljare &lt;oljare@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This algorithm works with &quot;inside&quot; points only.

I see<br/>Wikipedia shows a Mandelbrot midget in the tricorn (which<br/>it says is the same as Mandelbar).  The third degree set<br/>heads towards chaos faster, which might be important.</p><p>&gt; But what really surprises me is how similar the results<br/>&gt; sound to sine waves, sometimes phase/frequency modulated<br/>&gt; sine waves.
