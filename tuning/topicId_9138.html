The father of violinist Mat Maneri, he&apos;s long been<br/>a professor at the New England Conservatory, but didn&apos;t have any<br/>recordings as a leader released until he was 67 (Get Ready to Receive<br/>Yourself). Maneri&apos;s parents were Sicilian immigrants. He quit school<br/>at age 15 to play music professionally, and in the spirit of the true<br/>gigging musician took all available work. Of course, that meant lots<br/>of wedding jobs (Jewish, Greek, and various Balkan ethnicities) and<br/>bar mitzvahs, experiences he absorbed into his musical persona. He was<br/>also studying modern classical music, and in the 1940s he got together<br/>with a small group of like-minded musicians to experiment with free<br/>improvisation and 12-tone music. In 1961 three of Maneri&apos;s classical<br/>compositions were performed at Carnegie Recital Hall to favorable<br/>reviews, and in 1963 Third Stream conceptualist Gunther Schuller hired<br/>Maneri to play tenor saxophone on a Third Stream composition by David<br/>Reck. Next, Schuller pushed Atlantic Records to sign Maneri, and<br/>although the company passed on this opportunity, a Maneri-helmed<br/>quartet recorded a demo that finally appeared 35 years later. In 1970<br/>Schuller hired Maneri to teach composition at the New England<br/>Conservatory, and Maneri moved to the Boston area and settled into the<br/>academic life. He apparently played only rarely in public until<br/>Maneri&apos;s son Mat and some other area musicians and students prodded<br/>Joe into greater activity. In 1995 the English label Leo put out an<br/>album, certainly the most startling debut of the year or perhaps the<br/>decade, and Maneri finally began to receive the acclaim his truly<br/>unique talent merits. (Leo Lab, 1995, prod. Personasound Productions,<br/>Leo Feigin), Maneri&apos;s debut album, is as challenging as the most<br/>&quot;outside&quot; free jazz, but also generally subdued, which allows better<br/>appreciation of his fine gradations of tone quality. All the<br/>compositions are group improvisations except for &quot;Body and Soul,&quot;<br/>which is given a deeply felt reading. Bassist John Lockwood and<br/>drummer Randy Peterson provide sensitive accompaniment. Though it&apos;s a<br/>concert recording (from 1993), Dahabenzapple [Rating: 5.0] (Hat Jazz,<br/>1996, prod. Joe Maneri, Mat Maneri, Pia Uehlinger, Werner X.<br/>Uehlinger) has no showboating. In fact, it displays a very special<br/>intimacy over the course of its three 20-minute-plus improvisations,<br/>with Maneri putting so much into each note that a single phrase can<br/>carry as much meaning as an entire piece in mainstream jazz. Cecil<br/>McBee replaces Lockwood here.</p></div>
