As I understand your<br/>&gt;philosophy, Justin, you&apos;re interested in a form of strict JI that<br/>&gt;Dave isn&apos;t even considering here. Sure, a microtempered guitar can<br/>&gt;easily play vertical JI chords in the hands of a skilled player. Even<br/>&gt;a 12-tET guitar can do that. But then we&apos;re dealing with adaptive JI<br/>&gt;(which I favor anyway), rather than strict JI, where _all_ the<br/>&gt;intervals, melodic and harmonic, are based on ratios. Justin, from<br/>&gt;your comments, I take it you&apos;re interested in strict JI -- yes?</p><p>You would only get strict JI on a guitar from a robot who could play with<br/>uniform finger placement and pressure. My ideal is for strict JI in referential<br/>melody and harmony bending [barbershop style] to be consonant. I&apos;m not sure this<br/>meets your definition of adaptive tuning [which I think is close to John de<br/>Laubenfels approach]. But practically speaking ideals are not always the most<br/>advantageous option to pursue. There is of course the aspect of acuity in<br/>melodic listening being much less precise than in harmony.</p><p>Justin White</p></div><h3><a id=27327 href="#27327">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2001 11:43:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Justin White&quot; &lt;justin.white@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am in fact interested in how Daves developments could be applied<br/>to a CS<br/>&gt; [periodiciy block ?] that I came up with last weekend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; !

If this was acceptable it would make a guitar with very few missing<br/>notes and you might even keep the standard EADGBE open tuning without too<br/>much loss. To make the math easier you could consider it a subset of 94-EDO<br/>and have the errors only go up to 4.7c. But I&apos;ll assume that even 4.3c is<br/>too much.</p><p>We could try 9-limit Kleismic at 2.7c, or Miracle at 3.3c. Let&apos;s go for<br/>9-limit Kleismic (316.8c generator). I haven&apos;t worked with that before.<br/>It&apos;s one of Graham Breed&apos;s recent discoveries. From Grahams file<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/limit9.txt">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/limit9.txt</a><br/>we get the mapping from primes to numbers of generators<br/>3-&gt; 6 gens<br/>5-&gt; 5 gens<br/>7-&gt;22 gens</p><p>Then we can map your scale to numbers of generators by first<br/>prime-factorising the ratios. I do all this in Excel. I put in both 27/20<br/>and 25/18 for now. Then we mark all the notes on a chain of generators, and<br/>we see how many notes we lose from our scale if we shift the pattern by 1<br/>generator then 2 generators etc. From that we find what shifts along the<br/>chain result in the fewest notes lost. These turn out to be (not<br/>surprisingly) +6 and -6 generators (which correspond to 2:3 and 3:4). These<br/>shifts lose only 5 notes. Unfortunately we can&apos;t make an open string tuning<br/>with only these (and 0) without having strings either an 8:9 or a 2:3<br/>apart. So we include the second best, which are +-5, +-11 and +-12. These<br/>all lose 10 notes. Now we look at how many ways we can set them up to give<br/>acceptable intervals between open strings, when we take octaves into<br/>account. i.e. ideally we&apos;d only have intervals between a neutral third and<br/>a perfect fourth but are willing to go a little outside those if necessary.</p><p>Then we choose a few of these (should really look at them all but not<br/>automated yet) and find the scale rotation for each that loses the fewest<br/>notes in the critical region between the nut and the position corresponding<br/>to the pitch of the next string. I treat this linear temperament as a<br/>subset of 125-EDO to make the process easier (it turns out I could have<br/>used 72-EDO). For the final result I&apos;ve used the 9-limit RMS optimum<br/>generator 316.744c, even though this raises the max error to 3.0 cents (in<br/>the 4:9).</p><p>Here&apos;s the best combination of open string tuning and scale rotation I<br/>could find in a day. With this one it turns out to be best to choose 27/20<br/>rather than 25/18. I&apos;m afraid, with only 29 full-width frets, it has 5<br/>notes missing from the critical region, and in the low octave they are<br/>missing completely from the guitar. 16/9, 9/5, 243/128, 1/1, 32/27.</p><p>These can of course be restored by adding 5 more frets for a total of 34.<br/>Unfortunately the extra fret for 32/27 introduces a closer fret spacing (in<br/>cents) than already exists. 12.6c versus 18.1c. But it&apos;s close to the nut,<br/>so it is no worse in physical spacing than some of the those further down<br/>the neck.</p><p>The open strings and intervals between them are:</p><p>  432.6  383.7  383.7  432.6  383.7       cents<br/>   7:9    4:5    4:5    7:9    4:5        approx ratio<br/>7/4    9/8   45/32   7/4    9/8   45/32   note name</p><p>The fretting in cents is:</p><p>0.0<br/>30.7<br/>48.8<br/>67.0<br/>85.1<br/>97.7<br/>115.8<br/>134.0<br/>182.8<br/>200.9<br/>231.6<br/>267.9<br/>298.6<br/>316.7<br/>383.7<br/>414.4<br/>432.6<br/>499.5<br/>517.7<br/>584.6<br/>615.4<br/>682.3<br/>700.5<br/>767.4<br/>798.1<br/>816.3<br/>883.3<br/>914.0<br/>932.1<br/>999.1<br/>1017.2<br/>1084.2<br/>1114.9<br/>1133.0<br/>1200.0</p><p>I&apos;ve run out of time today to show the layout of the notes on the<br/>fingerboard.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=27330 href="#27330">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>8/24/2001 2:56:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9m4t34+nfo1@eGroups.com">9m4t34+nfo1@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Paul wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t have time to go through it all now, but it&apos;s clear you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; get &quot;extra&quot; consonant intervals and chords if you tune L and s in<br/>&gt; your scale according to their sizes in the 29-tone MOS of Graham&apos;s 7-<br/>&gt; limit schismic generator (who can give L and s)?</p><p>I don&apos;t know about the theoretical optimum, but 135-equal works well<br/>enough in practice.

Actually, for a fixed fingerboard, it is possible and not too<br/>difficult to fit a zeroth fret. Remove the nut and undercut the<br/>fingerboard at the nut like this</p><p>   ___________<br/>   \__________~~  but at about 45 degrees.

Alternately, if you can match the wood, make the undercut<br/>ahead of the nut and lay in the new piece. Of course, whether this is<br/>possible depends on the guitar. I have always felt that a zero fret<br/>was preferable, and in fact I had to eat a bug (a really small one) as<br/>the result of losing a challenge right here on the forum, when I<br/>challenged the readers to give me one good reason why they would<br/>prefer a nut over a zero fret.
