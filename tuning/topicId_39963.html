Actually most of these Blackjack developments were in<br/>the Spring of 2001 when Blackjack was &quot;invented.&quot;  You will find<br/>almost the entire history here on the list.  We had come to a kind<br/>of &quot;consensus&quot; on some of this stuff, with the assistance of Dave<br/>Keenan but, of course, no one is obligated to adhere to it.  There<br/>just was a kind of compelling logic to it that even won *me* over,<br/>eventually (I had to resticker my entire keyboard and retune<br/>everything with a different Scala file...)</p><p>I don&apos;t have a recording yet of my live Blackjack trombone piece, but<br/>I *do* have a &quot;synthetic&quot; one here, as well as a prototype of the new<br/>cello piece which is yet to be performed:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/140/tuning_lab.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/140/tuning_lab.html</a></p><p>And, I have an *electronic* piece in Blackjack on the Tuning Punks:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html</a></p><p>Monz can add any links to *real* music that he wishes, but it should<br/>be clear that the &quot;prototypes&quot; are not the &quot;final&quot; acoustic version.</p><p>J.
