This would give me quite a bit<br/>of flexibility in approach and the idea would be to minimize beating<br/>with the 72 pitches, so, essentially parts of those sections would be<br/>just.</p><p>Then I will have, conceivably, sections called &quot;Lattices...&quot;  These<br/>sections will be in *Blackjack* and I will use the Blackjack lattice<br/>to construct my harmonies.  These sections will be notated, of<br/>course, in 72-tET and again the instructions would be to minimize<br/>beating on the vertical harmonies, so I&apos;ll be going for just in those<br/>sections as well.</p><p>The Blackjack sections, of course, are more difficult to play, since<br/>there are fewer 12-equal notes in them on the overall, but they<br/>should be quite pure in sound and, hopefully, interested performers<br/>will be willing to put in the extra effort in those sections to<br/>achieve the &quot;serenity&quot; of justice.</p><p>Then the other 72 sections won&apos;t be *quite* as rigorous in that<br/>respect, so they won&apos;t have to slave quite as much over those... but<br/>still with some 72-just intervals.</p><p>*Just* some ideas....</p><p>J.
