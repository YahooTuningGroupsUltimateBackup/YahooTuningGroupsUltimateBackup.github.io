I am kind of learning my way around the bass at the moment, but<br/>originally I learned piano.  I have no intention of learning the guitar.  I<br/>have designed and built a 19 note per octave MIDI keyboard.  (It is a musical<br/>research tool to assist composing with a sequencer rather than a performance<br/>instrument.)</p><p>I have never met another microtonal music enthusiast in my life.  Please tell<br/>me you reside within 200 km of either of the above two cities.</p><p>DARREN McDOUGALL<br/>Australia</p></div>
