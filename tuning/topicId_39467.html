No, it<br/>wouldn&apos;t be too difficult to make the cents one, since I just have to<br/>copy *three* different numbers throughout the piece.</p><p>It would be an interesting experiment to see if there really is a<br/>different reaction between these two kinds of notation.  Johnny<br/>Reinhard thinks there is, and I take his opinions very seriously<br/>since he has had more experience with live performers than anyone on<br/>this list, myself included!</p><p>&gt; Do you get the same thing in music?<br/>&gt; Pieces that are only meant to be seen as scores and not<br/>&gt; to be played at all?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :-).<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Why of course, Robert!  Pieces like this go all the way from the<br/>present (see John Cage&apos;s book on _Notations_) to the Middle Ages!</p><p>There is, in fact, an established technical term for this kind of<br/>music, &quot;Augenmusik!&quot;</p><p>Here is a very famous piece by Baude Cordier which is meant as much<br/>for the &quot;looking&quot; as for the &quot;playing!&quot;:</p><p><a href="http://latawiec2000.republika.pl/gal/41.html">http://latawiec2000.republika.pl/gal/41.html</a></p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>10/14/2002 5:29:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph wrote:<br/>&gt;There is, in fact, an established technical term for this kind of<br/>&gt;music, &quot;Augenmusik!&quot;</p><p>The most famous example of this is, well around here, Jurriaan<br/>Andriessen&apos;s piano piece &quot;Hedwig&apos;s portrait&quot;.
