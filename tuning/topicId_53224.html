Controllers<br/>are available via the MIDI Tool, but as I say they are not<br/>fully-developed as sequencing is not the focus of the software.

Now I have<br/>my BA and I edit and engrave for a music publishing company.  Whenever<br/>I go to school for a Master&apos;s (I&apos;m waiting for my wife to finish her<br/>Bachelor of Science degree) I hope to study microtonality or serialism<br/>or computer-assisted composition, or some combination of those.

I poked my<br/>&gt; head in for a little while a couple of years back, but I was bogged<br/>&gt; down with school so my involvement didn&apos;t last too long.  Now I have<br/>&gt; my BA and I edit and engrave for a music publishing company.

I<br/>&gt; definitely need to spend some time with JI and lattices and stuff, so<br/>&gt; I hang out here to try to glean some information from the<br/>&gt; conversation.</p><p>I came back the other day after a long absence. Years ago, I discovered<br/>quartertones, joined this list, and embarrassed myself by &apos;discovering&apos;<br/>tunings that people discovered centuries ago without the help of computers<br/>or even calculators. The Columbus complex, I guess you could call it. Then I<br/>found out I can express almost everything I want with 72-edo, so I gave up<br/>trying to find the &apos;ultimate tuning&apos;. I&apos;d rather just theorize on the<br/>aesthetics of microtonalism rather than the mathematics and actually write<br/>microtonal music the average person would enjoy listening to. When I play<br/>bass with a group, I throw in an occasional &apos;half-fret&apos; and &apos;third-fret&apos; in<br/>various licks and especially solos. (My style is progressive alternative<br/>rock with jazz, blues, classical and world-music influences, and a couple<br/>years ago I converted my Ibanez 6-string fretted electric into a fretless,<br/>Jaco-style.)</p><p>Now I&apos;m rambling, but anyway, I&apos;m back. And welcome to the list.</p></div>
