The previous sentence should probably be in flashing lights.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll say it again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * WE CAN HAVE ONE SMALL SET OF SYMBOLS FOR NOTATING BOTH JI AND ETS *<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems like something we should have had a long time ago. Many<br/>&gt; thanks to Gene for pushing the idea.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The beauty is, that with this choice of commas, there is no need to go<br/>&gt; past 19-limit for notating all the ETs of interest, well into the<br/>&gt; hundreds. 19-limit means we only need 6 new pairs of symbols. This is<br/>&gt; far fewer than Rapoport&apos;s 5-limit system as used in Scala. This is<br/>&gt; because Rapoport needs all those 1/n-comma symbols. Because the 17 and<br/>&gt; 19 commas are so small, we don&apos;t need these 1-step symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These 17 and 19 commas just happen to step down in size from the<br/>&gt; syntonic and septimal comma in an almost perfect trinary system!: 27c,<br/>&gt; 9c, 3c. &lt;etc.&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To get the best approximation of that chord in _any_ ET you would just<br/>&gt; omit the symbols for any commas that vanish in that ET, and replace<br/>&gt; any symbols for higher primes with those of lower primes that<br/>&gt; correspond to the same number of steps. And sometimes we may use<br/>&gt; _pairs_ of symbols for lower primes in place of those for a higher<br/>&gt; prime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, in 12-tET the best approximation (athough not a usable or<br/>&gt; recognisable approximation) of that complete 19-limit otonality  is<br/>&gt; notated as.<br/>&gt; G:D:B:F:A:C:Eb:F#:G#:Bb<br/>&gt; We simply dropped all the comma symbols.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is not such a system very much worth having????????????</p><p>absolutely, yes.</p><p>is this not very much like what i&apos;ve been doing all along?  back<br/>in the 1980s, when i was first developing my JI theories, i had<br/>decided on a 19-limit because there seemed to be no real need<br/>to go beyond it in constructing a very large and comprehensive<br/>rational tuning system and notation, and later when i got interested<br/>in EDOs my notational ideas followed along the same lines.  what<br/>you wrote here, Dave, looks very familiar to me.</p><p>see my HEWM page if not clear about my notations<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/hewm.htm</a></p><p>which, BTW, has a big new update on Daniel Wolf&apos;s notational ideas.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=34742 href="#34742">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2002 8:58:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_34739.html#34739">/tuning/topicId_34739.html#34739</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; is this not very much like what i&apos;ve been doing all along?  back<br/>&gt; in the 1980s, when i was first developing my JI theories, i had<br/>&gt; decided on a 19-limit because there seemed to be no real need<br/>&gt; to go beyond it in constructing a very large and comprehensive<br/>&gt; rational tuning system and notation, and later when i got interested<br/>&gt; in EDOs my notational ideas followed along the same lines.  what<br/>&gt; you wrote here, Dave, looks very familiar to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; see my HEWM page if not clear about my notations<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/hewm.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which, BTW, has a big new update on Daniel Wolf&apos;s notational ideas.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***That address is wrong.</p><p>It&apos;s:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm</a></p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=34744 href="#34744">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2002 10:29:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: jpehrson2 &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 23, 2002 8:58 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: A common notation for JI and ETs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; see my HEWM page if not clear about my notations<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;incorrect URL snipped&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; which, BTW, has a big new update on Daniel Wolf&apos;s notational ideas.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***That address is wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm</a></p><p>oops... my bad.  thanks, Joe!</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=34750 href="#34750">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2002 1:41:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; see my HEWM page if not clear about my notations<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/hewm.htm</a></p><p>It&apos;s not there.

It was great to read Wolf&apos;s ideas. Yes, this idea has<br/>been popular for notating _rational_ scales for a long time, but<br/>everyone seems to use different commas once we get past prime 11.</p><p>I can find nothing on your excellent web page that even suggests that<br/>this notation could be or should be applied to ETs. And I don&apos;t see<br/>where you say 19 is enough (for ETs). Have you said these things<br/>somewhere else?</p><p>The only such suggestions I know of are those recent ones by George<br/>Secor, who stops at 11 and does not keep the commas separate, so that<br/>his notation is not suitable for notating rational scales, and that of<br/>Rapoport who in the conclusion of his paper, in which he develops his<br/>ET-notation based entirely on 5-limit commas, (the one used (slightly<br/>modified) by Manuel in Scala), writes:</p><p>&quot;The use of any of the above signs may not completely mitigate the<br/>complications inherent in this manner of notating close approximations<br/>to just tunings ... More concise signs are needed which represent the<br/>higher harmonics better ...&quot;</p><p>Neither of these authors specifically suggest a common notation for JI<br/>and ETs.</p><p>If anyone is aware of anyone else working on such a common<br/>JI/ET notation please let us know. Maybe Rapoport went on to do<br/>something in this regard.</p><p>The application of 19-limit JI notation to ETs wipes out the<br/>disagreement about which commas to use, once we realise that optimal<br/>accidentals form a trinary sequence, and that we want the commas to<br/>vanish in 12-tET, or a 12-tone Pythagorean chain.</p></div><h3><a id=34833 href="#34833">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 11:14:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: dkeenanuqnetau &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, February 25, 2002 12:26 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: A common notation for JI and ETs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was previously able to reject the use of \ / as comma symbols and<br/>&gt; therefore the whole (for want of a better term) &quot;European&quot; system of<br/>&gt; \/ &lt;&gt; v^ for 5, 7 11.

More seriously, I know that the<br/>accurate mapping of specific symbols are vital to your confidence in the<br/>system itself.   This is true for me as well so I cannot understand not<br/>wanting to feel nauseous with the pitch.  All I want to say is that if you<br/>use cents for performers everyone will be happy.

But<br/>I think they should then (if they need to go to cents notation at all)<br/>go from from 72-tET notation to seeing +-17, 33 and 50 cents on the<br/>scores and then other numbers.</p><p>Note that I believe that players of some instrument (continuous pitch<br/>and bendable-12-equal) will prefer cents-based notation, but that<br/>JI-oriented composers and players of purpose-built fixed-pitch<br/>instruments (whether JI, ET or linear temperament) will prefer a<br/>comma-based notation. Fewer accidentals for one thing.</p><p>72-tET is great because the notation comes out the same whether you<br/>are using the accidentals to indicate shifts in cents from 12-tET or<br/>higher-prime comma shifts from a Pythagorean approximation. This is<br/>because (a) its &quot;Pythagorean approximation&quot; happens to be 12-tET, and<br/>(b) the three primes 5,7 and 11 just happen to have their commas map<br/>to 1, 2 and 3 steps. So 72-tET is also training wheels for comma<br/>notation. 144-tET isn&apos;t.</p><p>To give 144-tET the same dual-purpose training-wheel properties, your<br/>new accidental would have to represent the 13-comma, which corresponds<br/>to 5 steps (the 5,7,11 commas correspond to 2,4,6 steps). This would<br/>be very messy, and one rarely needs to go past the 11-comma in<br/>notating most tunings of interest, using Pythagorean-comma notation.</p></div><h3><a id=34865 href="#34865">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 7:59:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_34739.html#34837">/tuning/topicId_34739.html#34837</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i think Gene meant, for example, 612edo, which gives 5-limit<br/>ratios with hardly any error and so is great as an integer<br/>measurement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s actually a good 7, 9 and 11-limit system also.</p><p>***So... then we get 51 degrees for each &quot;semi-tone&quot;...?</p><p>That may take a little &quot;getting used to...&quot;  :)</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=34867 href="#34867">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 8:05:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Dave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I was looking at multiples of 12 (for notation and consistency),<br/>&gt; I noticed that 12*52, 624-tet, was consistent through the 27-limit<br/>&gt; with all errors under 1&cent;.

Take a step or so within a certain harmonic scheme and then<br/>start working in the next one.  This is how I&apos;ve been mumbling it to myself,<br/>as of about 1991:</p><p>&quot;Limit&quot; - like I first heard it, the highest prime number used.<br/>&quot;Exclusion&quot; - the prime numbers NOT used in a limit.<br/>&quot;Indulgence&quot; - the scheme actually used within the limit.<br/>&quot;Abstinence&quot; - the scheme actually not used within the limit.<br/>&quot;Forcing&quot; - using a prime outside of the scheme lower than the limit.<br/>&quot;Exploring&quot; - using a prime outside of the scheme higher than the limit.</p><p>I noticed this same binary arrangement recently, only for odd numbers<br/>instead of prime.  This I think we called a binary indulgence something or<br/>other.  I&apos;ll have to ask Fred.  And yes of course there&apos;s a double size<br/>scheme when you intermix lack of octave:</p><p>2:  2nd limit.  Octave.</p><p>2 3:  3rd limit.  3L.  Pythagorean.</p><p>2 3 5:  5th limit.  5L.  Quint, or Quint-essential. (ha)</p><p>2 3 7:  7th limit, 5th exclusion. (If you notice the &quot;O P Q ? S&quot;<br/>progression, we used to just call this &quot;R&quot;.  Most of our checking it out was<br/>based on 6:7:8 melodies.)<br/>2 3 5 7:  7th limit.  Septimal.</p><p>2 3 11:  11th limit, 5th and 7th exclusion.<br/>2 3 5 11:  11th limit, 7th exclusion.<br/>2 3 7 11:  11th limit, 5th exclusion.<br/>2 3 5 7 11:  11th limit.</p><p>Almost like jazz chords, actually, add this, no that.  I&apos;m surprised Fred<br/>never came up with that.  I&apos;m REALLY surprised.  Like after we coined<br/>&quot;diatonic aperture&quot; he said &quot;what about shutter speed?&quot;  There&apos;s logic in<br/>facetiousness; it was that comment that started me on a lot of time studies.</p><p>Again, it wasn&apos;t so much just dealing with these loose floating limits in<br/>arbitrary just intonation experimentation.  We were very concerned with the<br/>Brun algorithm more than a lot of other things we worked on.  So we&apos;re not<br/>just talking about a simple test of whether the harmonics are good in any<br/>one particular temperament, but if that temperament actually showed up in an<br/>algorithm, the convergence web implied was the concern.  From THERE, then we<br/>used the aforementioned terms.</p><p>Actually we used the {2:1, 3:2, 5:4, 11:10} convergence a lot, which yielded<br/>19, 22, 41, 46, 65... All of which show up in several algorithms involving<br/>7th harmonics.  So what we did with this bunch, a lot of the post production<br/>on the K-Ram 22 stuff went like this:</p><p>&quot;11th limit, 7 exclusion; forced 7s, 3rd and 7th indulgence.&quot;<br/>Or, &quot;2 3 5 11&quot; algorithms with &quot;2 3 7&quot; arbitrary webs.</p><p>It&apos;s funny because the Toronto stuff was all from that same exact algorithm,<br/>but it was implimenting webs taken from 5th limit algorithms.  Oh well<br/>actually it was based on the fact that 46 showed up in the {2:1, 5:3, 4:3},<br/>and the web from THAT was taken and 19, 22 and 41 were shoved through that<br/>web.  Or something like that.  Not all Toronto, just Blueberry.  Ugh it&apos;s<br/>been so long.  Anyway I was saying, from the same algorithm, {2:1, 3:2, 5:4,<br/>11:10}, those two groups never sounded alike.  Even with the same guitars.<br/>But that&apos;s really just like comparing classical piano with jazz piano.  It&apos;s<br/>a different style within the same instrument.  This was just temperament.</p><p>I think of ANYTHING historical, the only thing we ever stuck by was the Brun<br/>algorithm and variations of it we came up with.  But then again we never<br/>read any Partch.  At that point we couldn&apos;t even get a hold of any.  Once we<br/>saw the way temperaments synergize, and once we saw the relative error<br/>decreasing systematically, AND once we made the convergence web discovery,<br/>well that seemed to take up a lot of our time for a few years.  Hence all<br/>the talk of 1171 and 1342 and such.</p><p>Sorry to babble.

After the point where I didn&apos;t even<br/>&gt; know wind instruments were capable of microtones, I would imagine that&apos;s a<br/>&gt; good way to notate it for non-linear instruments.  But for a keyboard or<br/>&gt; guitar, ehh.  Guitar anyway it would make more visual sense to me to take<br/>&gt; plus or minus actual notes from a recognizeable diatonic note.  There have<br/>&gt; been objections to using &quot;+/-&quot; notes at any cost, which I think I only<br/>&gt; leaned toward because of the actual shift in single notes.  I do like the<br/>&gt; idea, though, of having a certain sense of harmonic placement, notating with<br/>&gt; different commas and such.  That&apos;s pretty interesting.</p><p>just trying to catch up at all; still i beg to add my humble<br/>opinion largely concurring with marc:</p><p>for brass instruments, the built in intervals are harmonics,<br/>and it would make sense to notate deviations from the<br/>harmonic series or else use the comma based accidentals.<br/>it&apos;s a pity that this presupposes that either the composer<br/>or the instrumentalist understand exactly what they are<br/>doing.<br/>for fretted guitars, negative deviations are just confusing.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=35089 href="#35089">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2002 7:53:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_34739.html#35063">/tuning/topicId_34739.html#35063</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder would Joseph Pehrson find it worthwhile to compose in<br/>decimal if he could automatically convert it to Sims notation for the<br/>&gt; performers?</p><p>***I gather you believe, Dave, that somehow if I were to use Graham&apos;s<br/>*decimal* notation that I would have a firmer mental command of the<br/>compositional structure of the pieces.</p><p>Well, maybe, but I am so used to using *letter names* A-G that, it&apos;s<br/>*that* system that facilitates my compositional thinking.
