It&apos;s exactly as you have explained.</p><p>This is a basic rule of tonality, and tonal center - keeping the tonic function. Tonal center must be protected,  and locked against the changes. If you move with its notes intentionally, you change it and depending on the context you just deviate shortly (for the contrast or surprise) or you go to the other key (modulate). Of course such changes happen in classical music very often, it&apos;s not necessary to stay in one tonality during whole composition. This oscillation of tonal centres, and relation between harmonic functions in tonality is a base of tonal and extended tonal music. Beauty in it is that one and the same chord can have different functions depending on the context, and that we can use any chord in tonality, if only it&apos;s &quot;properly&quot; written. So there can be F# major triad in C major tonality, if only it will be written as F#-A#-Db or F#-Bb-Db. The other question is which harmonic function such chord will have - first one will be probably altered II, second one altered VII, or if they will be used isolated then they can be considered as chromatic mediants. Resolution of such chords usually follows natural direction, sharps usually go up, flats down. But the first chord can go as well to F-A-D or any other chord. The beauty of such chords is mainly in their transition role, they can stay between two common tonal chords and has as much narrow chromatic movements as possible. So for example (for the second chord, with added bass) D----F-A-D   .....    D#----F#-Bb-Db   ....  E----G-A-C. Functionally it will be II - double altered VII - T6 (in inversion)... Or they can be used to confuse the listeners and surprise them.</p><p>When composers realized this, they were not far from  more orthographically simple writing of such chords (and in fact aiming to extended tonality and atonality). Of course it&apos;s easier to read F#-A#-C# than F#-A#-Db. First one is graphically triad, the other one first inversion of triad.<br/>There are many examples even in Baroque music (Bach, and especially Scarlatti), but it took another 100 years to be fully accepted and used (Wagner, Liszt, Debussy, Skriabin, Rachmaninoff...). Skriabin&apos;s last works are atonal, even Liszt was very near.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 12 Apr 2010, at 9:53 PM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems clear to me that people&apos;s heads won&apos;t explode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BUT if you play C minor in C in C major you will not be in C major &gt; anymore.

FWIW, a few thoughts from me:</p><p>1) as Daniel stated, conventional music theory &quot;prohibits&quot; the use of certain accidentals in certain keys - but I think in many ways this is just a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; that helps students to learn the thing - e.g. in UK we have the &quot;Associated Board&quot; Theory of Music handbook and examinations - and if you don&apos;t notate your chromatic scale correctly, the answer will be marked &quot;wrong&quot;.  Of course, in this context, the chromatic scale consists of precisely 12 notes, as opposed to your list of 20.</p><p>2) elsewhere I have seen a list of 25 note names in &quot;chain of 5ths&quot; order) from Dbb to Cx (aka C##) which was explained as what Telemann or Mozart would have used - this is bigger than your list, of course, but is not confined to the key of C.  As Gene stated, that list would have been thought of in a &quot;meantone&quot; context - i.e. a single size of (tempered) 5th generating a chain of notes, whereas yours appears to derive from JI ratios.</p><p>3) Talking of which, 10 of your notes seem to have two different values depending on context, e.g. D = 9/8 or 10/9.  Even F and G have two values.  Not sure what to think about this.</p><p>4) I don&apos;t understand how you choose which  notes to include - yes, you start with a group of 10 notes &quot;around&quot; C, and then extend this by going to E, F, G, A (why not D and B?  and why not Ab Eb and Bb?); and then you iterate the process &quot;around&quot; G and F, and Eb (why?) (and why not E and A?  and D and B? etc).  And I don&apos;t understand &quot;the below keys can be mistaken for C&quot;, at all ...?  (It does allow inclusion of the notes &quot;around&quot; Ab and Eb, and Db)</p><p>5) If you add Ebb and E# to your list, you have a representation of the Indian 22 sruti relative to a tonic of C (but your ratios are different e.g the Indian version wouldn&apos;t have G# as 25/16 or Gb as 36/25).</p><p>Steve M.</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2010 9:57:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; What does &quot;prohibited&quot; mean?

So where he got that E#<br/>from idunno.<br/>He sais F can&apos;t go to F#, that E# must go to F# blabla.</p><p>Well I&apos;ve just about had it with normal music theory I thought.<br/>But yet what&apos;s beeing said on this list is completely different what my<br/>father said (yet the A# in C in normal music theory doesn&apos;t make much sense<br/>to me)</p><p>I think the answer is no.

Assuming meantone, Ab-C-Eb-F# is simply a different, and incidentially a more harmonious, chord than Ab-C-Eb-Gb, and you might notate it that way because you want the perforers to play it that way, as one obvious possibility.</p><p>And if you change F# for Gb and continue in Db major, why</p><p>&gt; it&apos;s called enharmonic modulation?  I&apos;m sure you will find the answers.</p><p>But will you? I&apos;m wondering if you were taught anything about the significance of meantone ideas to common practice. a topic which seems to be too often neglected.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2010 1:18:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Is this anything other than stipulation, and if so, what empirical content<br/>&gt; does it have? &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; centuries of common practice harmonic usage.

Bass note of the chord, and root note of the chord.<br/>In the basic shape of the chord (which means in triadic harmony that chord is made from thirds, of course some of them can be omitted, but basic skeleton of the chord must have triadic structure) root note = bass note. In inversions they differs, but root note of the chord is always the same.</p><p>So here in this case the root note is always Ab, and bass note can be Ab, C (yes, the harmonic function here is called N6, but only if the following chord is dominant G, G7, or double dominant D7 before G/G7, or double VII7b F#-A-C-Eb before G/G7, or altered II D#-F#-A-C in the case of C major), Eb or F#.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously I disagree with the common but not universal analysis of &gt; N6 as bII, and simply say N6.<br/>&gt;</p><p>To me N6 is only specifically used bII. Yes, it has fixed historical connotations, that&apos;s the reason why it&apos;s called so when analyzing Baroque and Classicism music. It doesn&apos;t change the fact that basic shape of this chord is not sixth chord. Sixth chord is always considered as less stable, weaker chord, only inversion of basic triad, which is strong, and considered satisfying (probably because it has a structure based on the first six harmonics). There are not much works in classical music which will use sixth or sixth-four inversion of triad as final chord of the work.<br/>When we analyze a chord, we usually try to find it&apos;s prevailing structure (be it secondal, thirdal or quartal, or combination of them), and the proper root note. Of course this must be done in the context of the period music and style, and follow composer&apos;s intention...

I&apos;m all for taking this as<br/>(of-the-V)/V but I think &quot;tritone substitution&quot; has connotations way too far from the historical voice leading.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; BUT I disagree with the root implication of analizing it as a &gt;bII.<br/>&gt; &gt; I feel that the root is actually C, as fa of sol (meaning the Ab is<br/>&gt; &gt; a minor sixth, as in the N6).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of G, but rooted on C: an ideal state, in C, of strengthening the<br/>&gt; &gt; dominant while maintaining the red thread of the tonic.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to me you mix here two different terms which should be<br/>&gt; distinguished. Bass note of the chord, and root note of the chord.<br/>&gt; In the basic shape of the chord (which means in triadic harmony &gt;that<br/>&gt; chord is made from thirds, of course some of them can be omitted, &gt;but<br/>&gt; basic skeleton of the chord must have triadic structure) root note =<br/>&gt; bass note. In inversions they differs, but root note of the chord &gt;is<br/>&gt; always the same.</p><p>As you say, Ab should be in the bass- but C IMO is the root. So, I would consider analizing as bII of G to be an example of mixing the terms bass note, root note here. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not confusing root and bass, LOL. I don&apos;t buy into the exact equation of closest voicing and root, and neither does common practice, otherwise I 6-4 would show up everywhere.</p><p>And, where&apos;s a German sixth usually going? I 6-4. IMO it&apos;s a suspension of rootedness, both chords have this quality, and traditionally so (not just my opinion).</p><p>So, I think my analysis of &quot;of V, but maintaining I&quot; is good.</p><p>But, I agree that I can&apos;t generalize as I have because, preceded by movement in i, VI/i would be a better analysis, which means in that case Ab would be the root, and bII of V would be the most sensible. When not preceded by movement in i, I&apos;m sticking to my analysis.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So here in this case the root note is always Ab, and bass note can &gt;be<br/>&gt; Ab, C (yes, the harmonic function here is called N6, but only if &gt;the<br/>&gt; following chord is dominant G, G7, or double dominant D7 before &gt;G/G7,<br/>&gt; or double VII7b F#-A-C-Eb before G/G7, or altered II D#-F#-A-C in &gt;the<br/>&gt; case of C major), Eb or F#.</p><p>I was just comparing it to the N6 to point out what I think is the root (whatever the bass!), by way of historical contrapuntal origin of N6, not calling it an N6. Ger6 is usually going to I 6-4. I think that going anywhere else is asking for parallel fifths but I&apos;d have to work it out.</p><p>Can you give me an example of that &quot;altered II D#-F#-A-C&quot; in context? I can see where it&apos;s going as far as voice-leading into a dominant-tonic situation obviously but you&apos;ve thrown me a loop as far as how this is linked to the German sixth or N6. If you remember a standard text where this is demonstrated that would be fine, I&apos;ll just get it from the library (my old texts are either in storage, or lost)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Obviously I disagree with the common but not universal analysis &gt;of<br/>&gt; &gt; N6 as bII, and simply say N6.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me N6 is only specifically used bII. Yes, it has fixed &gt;historical<br/>&gt; connotations, that&apos;s the reason why it&apos;s called so when analyzing<br/>&gt; Baroque and Classicism music. It doesn&apos;t change the fact that basic<br/>&gt; shape of this chord is not sixth chord. Sixth chord is always<br/>&gt; considered as less stable, weaker chord, only inversion of basic<br/>&gt; triad, which is strong, and considered satisfying (probably &gt;because<br/>&gt; it has a structure based on the first six harmonics). There are &gt;not<br/>&gt; much works in classical music which will use sixth or sixth-four<br/>&gt; inversion of triad as final chord of the work.</p><p>It would be a real learning experience for me if you could show me examples of this. Pre-Romantic, and in SATB kind of writing, no orchestral stuff with piles of octave doubling to balance things out. And no fair holding sol over through a cadential 6-4 while the upper voices resolve to root position or some such stunt. I believe you, it&apos;s just that I can&apos;t recall in the mind&apos;s ear such a sound prior to steam trains and laudanum.</p><p>&gt; When we analyze a chord, we usually try to find it&apos;s prevailing<br/>&gt; structure (be it secondal, thirdal or quartal, or combination of<br/>&gt; them), and the proper root note. Of course this must be done in &gt;the<br/>&gt; context of the period music and style, and follow composer&apos;s<br/>&gt; intention... Nobody with some knowledge will analyze Mozart&apos;s &gt;chords<br/>&gt; or harmony progressions from the view of quartal structure, or &gt;jazz<br/>&gt; harmony, or modality, or atonality...</p><p>Doesn&apos;t stop people from analizing everything in terms of 12-tET and Lacan though. Unfortunately.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And of course I know that what I am saying can be disputed, like<br/>&gt; &gt; this: &quot;well that makes sense for older works where the N6 was<br/>&gt; &gt; specifically a voice-leading thing always voiced with the sixth,<br/>&gt; &gt; but by Beethoven it appears in different inversions so insisting &gt;on<br/>&gt; &gt; the historical origin of what is now called ra as really being le-<br/>&gt; &gt; of-fa doesn&apos;t hold up anymore&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, for several reasons I&apos;m sticking to this interpretation,<br/>&gt; &gt; which I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll agree is thoughtful and informed even if you<br/>&gt; &gt; disagree with it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; First, I think it helps keep the historical evolution of the<br/>&gt; &gt; sonority in mind.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Second, it insists on keeping counterpoint and voice-leading in mind<br/>&gt; &gt; (because if I hear any more contemporary orchestral film music<br/>&gt; &gt; which is obviously some &quot;composer&quot; laying out block chords in<br/>&gt; &gt; Cubase and then having some poor orchestrator trying to make some<br/>&gt; &gt; semblance of decent voice leading out of it, I&apos;m going to screech<br/>&gt; &gt; like a wild pig).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Third, it&apos;s important for JI or expressive or whatever tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; interpretations. And fourth, I think that maintaining these three<br/>&gt; &gt; points is beneficial to creating new music in new tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Cameron<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see here any connection between this traditional extended<br/>&gt; tonal chordal structures and functional harmony progressions - and<br/>&gt; new music in new tunings. But for sure it&apos;s very good for composer &gt;of<br/>&gt; New music to be fluent in all historical styles and theories, even<br/>&gt; when it&apos;s not much usable for contemporary composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;</p><p>The connection is in the voice-leading and the counterpoint. You can write music in any damn tuning if you can write counterpoint.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
