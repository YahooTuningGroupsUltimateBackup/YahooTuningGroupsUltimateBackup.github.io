If you also take into account dynamics that veil the<br/>beginnings of endings of a note, then there is virtually nothing<br/>objective left in such measurements.

Why does it start from a specific,<br/>fixed pitch or from a certain distance from the target note?</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Klaus</p></div>
