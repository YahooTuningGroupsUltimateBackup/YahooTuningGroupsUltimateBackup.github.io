One of the common responses to<br/>our &quot;Beethoven In The Temperaments&quot; CD was a request for a comparative<br/>juxtaposition of tunings, using ET in there somewhere.  Sooooo......  after<br/>recording the Mozart KV 385 on a Prelleur WT,  the piano, (Steinway Concert<br/>D)  was retuned to 1/4C for Scarlatti&apos;s K96.<br/>   After the Scarlatti was finished, I asked Enid Katahn to play the Mozart<br/>on it. The wolves are howling!!  Then, following that, with a retune to ET,<br/>she played the Mozart again.  Eureka!  &quot;Menage A Mozart&quot;.   I am hoping that<br/>hearing the same piece played in the three tunings will allow the modern ear<br/>to make a more informed choice about the value of unequal temperament.  We<br/>will see.  I will post here when the projects are actually ready to be<br/>shipped.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div>
