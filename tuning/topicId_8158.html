I have NEVER in all the theory classes I took (and admittedly I<br/>took too many of them) heard a discussion of chromatic runs from the point<br/>of view of tuning (!!)  However, I am a bit confused:  it is clear that<br/>such descending and ascending chromatic passages are not featured in Bach,<br/>unless they are mostly chordal outlines.  It makes sense that this could<br/>partially be due to the tuning, although I had never thought of it before.<br/>Certainly such even chromatic passages are common with Mozart, all over the<br/>place.  Would Don Giovanni still be in meantone??  When does 12-tET come<br/>in??  Wouldn&apos;t Mozart be already in the &quot;mechanical, even&quot; tuning that P.<br/>Erlich mentions in  W.A. Mathieu&apos;s treatise??... did Mozart change his<br/>style during his lifetime as the tuning progressed??  This wouldn&apos;t make<br/>sense, though, since Don Giovanni is quite late in his output.  (??? Ich<br/>bin verloren...)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
