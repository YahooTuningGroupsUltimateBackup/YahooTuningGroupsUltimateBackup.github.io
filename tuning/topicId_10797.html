While such a description is<br/>mathematically accurate, I have come to question the _musical_<br/>significance of 7-limit approximations in Xeno-Gothic style.</p><p>In a Xeno-Gothic tuning, two 12-note keyboards are mapped with<br/>identical Pythagorean tunings (typically Eb-G#) a Pythagorean comma<br/>apart (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents). From a mathematical point of<br/>view, this arrangements makes available intervals a comma larger or<br/>smaller than usual which closely approximate 7-based ratios.</p><p>Using the symbol @ to show a note lowered by a Pythagorean comma, and<br/>C4 for middle C (with higher note numbers for higher octaves), we thus<br/>have narrow minor thirds at ~7:6 (e.g. E3-G@3), narrow minor sevenths<br/>at ~7:4 (e.g. C3-Bb@3); and wide major seconds at ~8:7 (e.g. D@-E),<br/>wide major thirds at ~9:7 (e.g. G3@-B3), and wide major sixths at<br/>~12:7 (e.g. A@3-F#4).</p><p>While it may be mathematically interesting that these intervals are<br/>only a &quot;septimal schisma&quot; or ~3.80 cents from 7-limit ratios -- the<br/>difference between the Pythagorean comma and the septimal comma of<br/>64:63 (~27.26 cents), the question remains as to how _musically_<br/>significant this approximation is in a neo-medieval style where the<br/>3-limit, not the 7-limit, is the basis for stability.</p><p>In an experiment which may lend a bit of Aristoxenian pragmatism to<br/>this question, I tried certain typical Xeno-Gothic cadences resolving<br/>&quot;near-7-limit&quot; sonorities in 17-tone equal temperament (17-tet), where<br/>the relevant unstable intervals likewise have an &quot;exaggerated<br/>Pythagorean&quot; quality but are 11-19 cents removed from 7-based ratios.</p><p>My tentative conclusion is that these progressions have a similar and<br/>comparably pleasing &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; quality in 17-tet, and that<br/>&quot;near-7-limit&quot; terminology may run the risk of obscuring both the<br/>musical significance and aesthetic intent of this neo-medieval style.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>1. Xeno-Gothic tetrads and &quot;cadence-stacking&quot;<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>In a recent dialogue with such helpful contributors as Paul Erlich and<br/>Graham, I learned a very important lesson in discussing Xeno-Gothic.<br/>There is a need to place due emphasis on the _Gothic_ aspect of this<br/>style, the 13th-14th century practices and conventions which serve as<br/>a basis this approach to using a 24-note Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>For example, as Paul Erlich demonstrated in a very helpful example<br/>relating various schismas, the term &quot;full 7-limit tetrad&quot; suggests a<br/>4:5:6:7 sonority. In Xeno-Gothic, however, a sonority such as<br/>G3-B3-D4-F4 is not especially characteristic; and when it does occur,<br/>a regular 3-limit Pythagorean tuning (576:729:864:1024) is usual.</p><p>A typical Xeno-Gothic tetrad including a major third and minor<br/>seventh in &quot;near-7-limit&quot; ratios, in contrast, would be ~12:14:18:21<br/>-- taking the 7-limit notation with a large grain of salt, as we may<br/>see by the end of this article. Incidentally, were we to speak in such<br/>terms, this would actually be a &quot;9-odd-limit tetrad.&quot;</p><p>Here is such an unstable Xeno-Gothic tetrad and its standard<br/>resolution to a stable 3-limit concord:</p><p>           D@4 C@4<br/>           B3  C@4<br/>           G@3 F@3<br/>           E3  F@3</p><p>This unstable tetrad and its directed resolution may be said to<br/>reflect a process of &quot;cadence-stacking&quot; in which two or more two-voice<br/>progressions are superimposed to built a unifying multi-voice<br/>progression. Before considering the &quot;Xeno&quot; aspect, the comma<br/>alterations, let&apos;s consider a Gothic version of this cadence in usual<br/>Pythagorean:</p><p>           D4 C4<br/>           B3 C4<br/>           G3 F3<br/>           E3 F3</p><p>(m7-5 + m3-1 + M3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>Here we have four two-voice progressions each moving from an unstable<br/>to a stable 3-limit interval by stepwise contrary motion. The outer<br/>minor seventh contracts to a fifth, and the lower and upper minor<br/>thirds to unisons; the middle major third expands to a fifth.</p><p>Further, these progressions fit the 14th-century ideal of &quot;closest<br/>approach,&quot; or of &quot;moving to the nearest concord&quot;: one voice of the<br/>unstable interval moves by a whole-tone (9:8, ~203.91 cents), the<br/>other by a compact diatonic semitone (256:243, ~90.22 cents). Such<br/>resolutions have an especially efficient quality.</p><p>Resolutions fitting this &quot;closest approach&quot; paradigm include M2-4,<br/>M3-5, and M6-8 (by expansion); and m3-1 and m7-5 (by contraction).<br/>By &quot;mixing and matching&quot; these elementary resolutions, we can build<br/>powerful multi-voice cadences to stable 3-limit sonorities.</p><p>In Xeno-Gothic, we have the option of making these standard Gothic<br/>progressions &quot;superefficient&quot; by adding a comma to expanding major<br/>intervals (M2-4, M3-5, M6-8), bringing them yet closer to the stable<br/>goal of their expansion; and likewise subtracting a comma from<br/>contracting intervals (m3-1, m7-5).</p><p>To describe these altered unstable intervals, I refer to &quot;maximal&quot;<br/>seconds, thirds, and sixths (Mx2-4, Mx3-5, Mx6-8) and &quot;minimal&quot; thirds<br/>and sevenths (mn3-1, mn7-5).</p><p>Let us now return to our Xeno-Gothic tetrad and its resolution:</p><p>             D@4 C@4<br/>             B3  C@4<br/>             G@3 F@3<br/>             E3  F@3</p><p>(mn7-5 + mn3-1 + Mx3-5 + mn3-1)</p><p>In each of our four &quot;superefficient&quot; two-voice resolutions, one voice<br/>still moves by a usual 9:8 whole-tone, but the other has a narrowed<br/>semitone a Pythagorean comma smaller than the already compact 256:243<br/>-- about 66.76 cents, or roughly 1/3-tone. Here the ascending<br/>semitones E3-F@3 and B3-C@4 illustrate this &quot;supernarrow&quot; semitone.</p><p>Thus whether the unstable thirds and sevenths of such &quot;Xeno-Gothic<br/>tetrads&quot; are tuned in a usual Pythagorean fashion, or in a<br/>superefficient &quot;near-7-limit&quot; manner, the progression is based on<br/>3-limit logic.</p><p>While speaking of &quot;near-7-limit tetrads&quot; may rather accurately report<br/>the size of the relevant unstable intervals, it may also obscure their<br/>musical significance in a complex 3-limit setting.</p><p>----------------------------<br/>2. A comparison test: 17-tet<br/>----------------------------</p><p>While Xeno-Gothic tuning uses two 12-note Pythagorean keyboards a<br/>comma apart to provide altered versions of the standard intervals,<br/>17-tet features regular major seconds (3/17 octave, ~211.77 cents),<br/>thirds (6/17 octave, ~423.53 cents), and sixths (13/17 octave, ~917.65<br/>cents) somewhat larger than Pythagorean. Minor thirds (4/17 octave,<br/>~282.35 cents) and sevenths (14/17 octave, ~988.24 cents) are likewise<br/>somewhat smaller than Pythagorean.</p><p>The normal diatonic semitone of 17-tet (1/17 octave, ~70.59 cents) is<br/>considerably smaller than in usual Pythagorean, and not far from the<br/>Xeno-Gothic &quot;superefficient&quot; semitone a comma smaller (~66.76 cents),<br/>both intervals having a &quot;thirdtone&quot; quality.</p><p>Thus the normal 17-tet intervals have a kinship to the so-called<br/>&quot;near-7-limit&quot; intervals of 24-note Xeno-Gothic, but one importance<br/>difference for our testing purposes: they are much further from<br/>7-based ratios than the ~3.80 cents of the septimal comma:</p><p>   17-tet interval  cents     7-based ratio    cents     difference<br/>   ---------------  -------   -------------    -------   ----------<br/>   M2   (3 steps)   ~211.76       8:7          ~231.17    ~19.41<br/>   m3   (4 steps)   ~282.35       7:6          ~266.87    ~15.48<br/>   M3   (6 steps)   ~423.53       9:7          ~435.08    ~11.55<br/>   M6  (13 steps)   ~917.65      12:7          ~933.13    ~15.48<br/>   m7  (14 steps)   ~988.24       7:4          ~968.83    ~19.41</p><p>In a rather casual and quite unscientific survey of one, I find that the<br/>17-tet intervals seem just as satisfying for Xeno-Gothic progressions<br/>as the &quot;near-7-limit&quot; intervals of 24-note Pythagorean.</p><p>Thus in describing either tuning as used for a Gothic or neo-Gothic<br/>3-limit style, it might be more apt to speak simply of minimal thirds<br/>and sevenths smaller than regular Pythagorean, and maximal seconds,<br/>thirds, and sixths larger than Pythagorean, rather than to bring in<br/>&quot;near-7-limit&quot; concepts.</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>3. Super-Pythagorean intervals and zones<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>While 7-limit intervals and septimal commas and schismas may not be<br/>especially significant in explaining the musical effect of<br/>&quot;superefficient&quot; 3-limit progressions in a neo-Gothic style, the<br/>septimal comma may nevertheless provide one possible landmark in<br/>mapping a rough &quot;Super-Pythagorean zone&quot; for unstable intervals in<br/>such progressions.</p><p>Thus we might describe maximal seconds, thirds, and sixths as having<br/>sizes appreciably larger than regular Pythagorean, but not larger by<br/>too much more than a septimal comma (~27.26 cents). Similarly, minimal<br/>thirds and sevenths might be described as smaller than Pythagorean,<br/>but not smaller by too much more than a septimal comma.</p><p>The idea here is to propose a rough range where intervals are somewhat<br/>larger or smaller than Pythagorean, but still are recognizable for<br/>example as very large major sixths rather than small minor sevenths in<br/>a resolution such as M6-8, or conversely as very small minor sevenths<br/>rather than large major sixths in m7-5. etc.</p><p>If the septimal comma roughly approximates the size of this zone -- in<br/>the wide direction for maximal intervals and the narrow direction for<br/>minimal ones -- then we might suggest ranges like these:</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>interval    typical resolution              rough range<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> Mx2             Mx2-4              9:8  (~203.91) -  8:7  (~231.17)<br/> Mx3             Mx3-5             81:64 (~407.82) -  9:7  (~435.08)<br/> Mx6             Mx6-8             27:16 (~905.87) - 12:7  (~933.13)<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> mn3             mn3-1              7:6  (~266.87) - 32:27 (~294.13)<br/> mn7             mn7-5              7:4  (~968.83) - 16:9  (~996.09)<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This table is only a first suggestion, and it might be interesting to<br/>see how various listeners familiar (or familiarized) with these<br/>neo-Gothic resolutions might perceive intervals such as the supermajor<br/>third of 440 cents in Gary Morrison&apos;s 88-cent equal temperament<br/>(88-cet).</p><p>Another way of describing such resolutions is to say that they<br/>typically involve narrow melodic semitones smaller than the usual<br/>Pythagorean diatonic semitone of 256:243 (~90.22 cents) but not much<br/>smaller than a 28:27 (~62.96 cents). In both 24-note Pythagorean<br/>or Xeno-Gothic and in 17-tet, these semitones are in the &quot;1/3-tone&quot;<br/>range -- ~66.76 cents (a Pythagorean comma smaller than 256:243) and<br/>~70.59 cents (1/17 octave) respectively.</p><p>Here I would emphasize that the intend is descriptive, not<br/>prescriptive: there is no reason why one might not experiment with<br/>having a 450-cent interval expand to a 700-cent fifth in 24-tet, for<br/>example, with motion by a usual 200-cent whole-tone in one part and a<br/>50-cent quartertone in the other. Such a progression, with * showing a<br/>note raised by such a quartertone, might closely approximate one<br/>literal reading of the cadential &quot;diesis&quot; of Marchettus of Padua<br/>(1318), for example:</p><p> B*3 -- +50 -- C4<br/>(450)        (700)<br/> G3 -- -200 -- F3</p><p>However, such a cadential interval in the zone of &quot;categorical<br/>ambiguity&quot; resolving by quartertone motion might have a different<br/>effect than Xeno-Gothic or 17-tet with its characteristic thirdtone<br/>melodic motion. More familiarity with Gothic and neo-Gothic<br/>progressions, as well as with these tunings, may prompt many pleasant<br/>variations.</p><p>---------------<br/>4. More to come<br/>---------------</p><p>If speaking of &quot;near-7-limit&quot; intervals in Xeno-Gothic may distract<br/>from rather than clarify the medieval and neo-medieval 3-limit<br/>aesthetics of this style, aesthetics aptly realized by 17-tet also,<br/>then the question arises of how these aesthetics might better be<br/>described and explained.</p><p>In a &quot;prequel&quot; to this article, I hope to develop such an explanation<br/>based on the late Gothic concepts of &quot;perfection&quot; and &quot;coloration&quot; as<br/>applied to unstable intervals expanding or contracting to stable ones,<br/>with neo-medieval progressions in Xeno-Gothic or 17-tet as a kind of<br/>manneristic amplification of these concepts -- &quot;superperfection&quot; and<br/>&quot;supercoloration.&quot;</p><p>Also, the treatment in Gothic and neo-Gothic styles of tritonic<br/>seventh sonorities such as G3-B3-D4-F4 in a 3-limit-oriented manner<br/>may illustrate some of the qualities of these styles; thanks to Paul<br/>Erlich and his 4:5:6:7 for setting the stage for a coming article on<br/>the 576:729:864:1024 and its direct or indirect resolution.</p><p>Last but not least, this experiment has intensified my passion for<br/>17-tet, a tuning which some attention to the Setharian factor of<br/>timbre may make delightful for conventional 13th-14th century music as<br/>well as neo-Gothic genres. Lending a novel color to familiar<br/>progressions, and offering some strikingly new and beautiful ones,<br/>this tuning is a topic which warmly beckons.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/21/2000 3:11:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In this post, I&apos;ll use prime limits because that makes it simpler.

Before considering the &quot;Xeno&quot; aspect, the comma<br/>&gt; alterations, let&apos;s consider a Gothic version of this cadence in usual<br/>&gt; Pythagorean:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;            D4 C4<br/>&gt;            B3 C4<br/>&gt;            G3 F3<br/>&gt;            E3 F3</p><p>Which for me is:</p><p>  D/4    C4<br/>  B/3    C4<br/>  G3     F3<br/>  E/3    F3</p><p>and I&apos;ve also tried this 5-limit version:</p><p>  D/4    C4<br/>  B3     C4<br/>  G3     F3<br/>  E3     F3</p><p>Where the minor thirds are 5/6 and the major third is 5/4.  So we have 3-,<br/>5- and 7-limit tunings of the progression.</p><p>I tried these chords in three different tunings, using the Harpsichord<br/>patch on my SB Live!.  The first is Pythagorean, the second is my optimal<br/>5-limit tuning, where 6/5 is just, and the third is my optimal 7-limit<br/>tuning, where 7/4 and 7/6 are almost just.  Fifths are always almost just,<br/>that being the way of schismic tuning.</p><p>My exact optimum 7-limit tuning is based on the following scientifically<br/>chosen principles:</p><p>1) Be close to the minimax tuning.  I think this is where 7/4 is just, but<br/>it could also be where 7/6 is just.  Whatever, the condition states the<br/>tuning must be somewhere in-between.</p><p>2) Slightly favour 7/4.  Don&apos;t know why, it was a while back I worked this<br/>out.</p><p>3) Make the comma, as expressed in octaves, a nice number.</p><p>All conditions are satisfied by making the comma equal to 0.022222...<br/>octaves.  This happens to be identical to 135-equal.  The fourth is 56/135<br/>octaves and the fifth is 79/135 octaves or 702.222222... cents.</p><p>In the 5-limit tuning, the 5-limit progression is best, the 3-limit okay<br/>and the 7-limit nothing special.</p><p>In the Pythagorean tuning, the 3-limit progression is probably best, the<br/>others okay.</p><p>In the 7-limit tuning, the 7-limit progression is really stunning.  The<br/>others are still okay, but all 7-limit definitely has my vote.</p><p>&gt; Thus the normal 17-tet intervals have a kinship to the so-called<br/>&gt; &quot;near-7-limit&quot; intervals of 24-note Xeno-Gothic, but one importance<br/>&gt; difference for our testing purposes: they are much further from<br/>&gt; 7-based ratios than the ~3.80 cents of the septimal comma:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    17-tet interval  cents     7-based ratio    cents     difference<br/>&gt;    ---------------  -------   -------------    -------   ----------<br/>&gt;    M2   (3 steps)   ~211.76       8:7          ~231.17    ~19.41<br/>&gt;    m3   (4 steps)   ~282.35       7:6          ~266.87    ~15.48<br/>&gt;    M3   (6 steps)   ~423.53       9:7          ~435.08    ~11.55<br/>&gt;    M6  (13 steps)   ~917.65      12:7          ~933.13    ~15.48<br/>&gt;    m7  (14 steps)   ~988.24       7:4          ~968.83    ~19.41</p><p>Right, normal 17-tet intervals, so this is the 3-limit progression played<br/>in 17-equal.  The 7-limit progression actually leaves no movement between<br/>E/ and F\, B\ and C/.</p><p>As the distinction between the 3- and 7-limit progressions is lost, it<br/>seems that this breaks the spirit of Xeno-Gothic: that you can choose the<br/>commas.  Although the 5-7 distinction is still there.</p><p>&gt; In a rather casual and quite unscientific survey of one, I find that the<br/>&gt; 17-tet intervals seem just as satisfying for Xeno-Gothic progressions<br/>&gt; as the &quot;near-7-limit&quot; intervals of 24-note Pythagorean.</p><p>Yes, I find that the 5-limit progression is still good and recognisable,<br/>and the 3-limit is good and recognizable ... as the 7-limit progression.<br/>However, all 7-limit still has my vote.  A certain amount is lost in all<br/>cases, moving from the optimal tunings.</p><p>I also tried the first 7-limit chord, and resolving to the second chord a<br/>step high, but that didn&apos;t really work at all.</p><p>&gt; Thus in describing either tuning as used for a Gothic or neo-Gothic<br/>&gt; 3-limit style, it might be more apt to speak simply of minimal thirds<br/>&gt; and sevenths smaller than regular Pythagorean, and maximal seconds,<br/>&gt; thirds, and sixths larger than Pythagorean, rather than to bring in<br/>&gt; &quot;near-7-limit&quot; concepts.</p><p>I disagree, because using a 7-limit optimised tuning does improve the<br/>progression.  So the 7-limit interpretation must be relevant.</p><p>Errors are to be expected, it&apos;s getting late,</p><p>            Graham</p></div>
