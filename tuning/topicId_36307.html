The program<br/>decides on the basis of the current scale and notation system where<br/>there will be black keys, and if they will be split (in the same way<br/>as on an Italian &quot;cembalo cromatico&quot;). On the screen the black keys<br/>are light blue, to keep the note names visible in black. One can<br/>experiment using different notation systems to see which delivers<br/>the best ergonomic result. The notes with natural note names, C, D,<br/>E, etc., if present, will be mapped to the white keys. For some<br/>nondiatonic or non-octave scales that result may not be quite<br/>satisfactory, but the algorithm to assign the keys was not designed<br/>to handle all of these. The Bohlen-Pierce scale is supported<br/>(notation systems BP, KL, KD and KG) as are some other systems which<br/>don&apos;t map to a 7+5 keyboard like S10, R13, C22, P22 and B72. To<br/>change the notation system, press the &quot;Select...&quot; button.<br/>When you press the &quot;Scale preset&quot; button after changing the notation<br/>system, a scale will be loaded (replacing the current scale) which<br/>is typical for that system, often it is an equal temperament. For<br/>unequal scales, the current directory must be where the scale<br/>archive is unzipped, and the scale will be loaded from there, for<br/>example for I22 the shruti scale &quot;indian.scl&quot; will be loaded.<br/>The Shift key can be used in combination with the left mouse button<br/>to select and hold notes. When it&apos;s pressed together with the left<br/>mouse button, the mouse can be moved over the keys and they will all<br/>be played. The Control key acts as a sustain pedal, but the notes<br/>will not be released immediately when the key is released, but at<br/>the next mouse button press. The maximum polyphony is 16 minus the<br/>number of excluded MIDI channels, so typically 15.<br/>In the sound settings dialog you can choose the sound (program<br/>number), MIDI device and velocity, and playing mode. The latter has<br/>three options, normal on and off with the left mouse button press<br/>and release (staccato), or on with the left mouse button press and<br/>off at the next one (legato), and a &quot;mouse over&quot; mode not requiring<br/>button presses.<br/>When some notes are held by having used the Shift or Control key,<br/>the left and right cursor key will move this chord down- or upwards<br/>one scale degree, or two if you press Shift simultaneously, or three<br/>with the Control key. The number of octaves can be controlled with<br/>the up and down cursor keys, and has a maximum of 10.<br/>Also a chord can be remembered and played at any position by first<br/>selecting the notes with the shift key, and while holding the shift<br/>key, pressing the right mouse button. Then the chord can be played<br/>with the right mouse button. The Control key can also be combined<br/>with this button to sustain notes.<br/>When the mode selection window is on the screen (via Modify-&gt;Mode or<br/>the Mode button on the Clavier window) and a mode is selected<br/>(highlighted), the unavailable notes in the scale will be dark green<br/>and not playable, to allow experimentation with the modes. When the<br/>Apply button in the mode window is pressed, these notes will be<br/>removed from the scale and subsequently from the Clavier, which can<br/>be undone by the Undo button in the mode window.<br/>The Clavier window can be resized horizontally and vertically with<br/>no restriction. When the keys become too small, the note names are<br/>left away. You can also bring it up by pressing the F4-key from the<br/>main window.<br/>See <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala</a></p><p>Manuel</p></div>
