I *like* the<br/>blips, self-oscillating wails and crunches you can get out of both<br/>hardware and software synthesizers.  I&apos;m even a big fan of the<br/>mechanical esthetic lurking in techno/dance music.</p><p>        Sometimes, though, you want an Oboe.  Or a string section.<br/>And I want them to play a minor third as 7:6.</p><p>        There are some lovely orchestral sampler modules out there now<br/>with a wide range of articulations, etc. to choose from.  On the good<br/>side, many of them are retunable.  On the bad side, the resultion of<br/>this retuning is generally about 1.5 cents presumably because they<br/>want to shove the retuning information for each note into a sinlge,<br/>signed byte.</p><p>        Considering how deeply compromised some intervals in 12tet<br/>are, how much does a little drift matter *in practice*, ignoring for<br/>the moment the irritation this theoretical impurity causes?  Does it<br/>matter that I don&apos;t use chords with more than 4 identities sounding at<br/>once?</p><p>--<br/>wm,<br/>who can&apos;t decide if he should talk himself out of the proteus2k</p></div><h3>Paul H.

This came up on the<br/>list recently, where someone (was it you?) noted that while the wolf fifth<br/>sounded horrible on its own, when split into a slightly flat major third on<br/>the bottom and a slightly flat minor third on the top, it sounded OK as part<br/>of a major triad.</p><p>However, that wouldn&apos;t work if you switched the intervals and made it a<br/>minor triad. Then there is no otonal synergy, and the worst intervallic<br/>mistunings are about as disturbing as they would be on their own.</p><p>&gt;My hope is for people with experience with these less than<br/>&gt;perfect synths and samplers to report on their experiences.</p><p>I do have a less-than-perfect synth, but I&apos;m basing my comments on my<br/>exploration of temperaments, and of course the &quot;wolf fifth&quot; example, which<br/>involve far larger tuning errors than those of even low-end retunable synths<br/>(which use 512-tET).</p></div><h3>Paul H.

This is because the otonal interpretation of the minor triad can<br/>slide pretty smoothly between 10:12:15, 16:19:24, and 6:7:9 without huge<br/>changes in the harmonic entropy -- but similar changes in the thirds of a<br/>major triad will take you up the pretty steep walls around the 4:5:6 and be<br/>more disturbing.</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2000 7:45:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>- I have a Proteus 2: Orchestra synth.

The Microtune12 macro has a +/- 50 cents tuning.  You<br/>&gt; are certainly free to fix the macro for greater range if you wish,<br/>&gt; which I have done in the past.</p><p>I don&apos;t think you were that specific when we discussed this on this list<br/>a few weeks ago.</p><p>Enjoy yer self!</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>10/16/2000 3:11:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;xouoxno@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; David, can you store global tuning tables on the MS2000R?
