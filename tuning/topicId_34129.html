Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2002 3:41:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Dave Keenan, and thank you for your very readable and<br/>reasonable comments on the major third and neutral third questions,<br/>where our views might actually not be that different, despite some<br/>different stylistic conventions that could reflect musical<br/>expectations in certain tuning systems and genres.</p><p>&gt; Hi Margo,</p><p>&gt; You (and possibly Paul and Joseph) seem to have made a case for<br/>&gt; calling anything from about 380 cents to about 440 cents an<br/>&gt; (unqualified) major third merely because it is generated by a chain<br/>&gt; of four approximate 2:3s in the particular tuning under<br/>&gt; consideration.</p><p>Here you remarks might lead me to qualify that generalization a bit:<br/>my implicit or not-so-implicit qualifications would be that a &quot;major<br/>third&quot; so defined actually fits the musical purposes at hand, and also<br/>that the definition makes sense in a specific universe of discourse.</p><p>For example, someone using 46-EDO to approximate 5-limit harmony would<br/>naturally take 15/46 octave rather than 16/46 octave as &quot;the major<br/>third.&quot; When I take 16/46 as representing a &quot;usual major third,&quot; this<br/>says at least as much about my stylistic conventions as about the<br/>chain of fifths.</p><p>&gt; Whereas I would prefer to qualify those more than about 8 cents<br/>&gt; wider than 4:5 with terms like equal, Pythagorean and septimal (as<br/>&gt; Scala does), or in another system: wide, narrow-super, super. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; happy to drop the &quot;wide&quot;s and &quot;narrow&quot;s if a tuning only has one<br/>&gt; kind, but not the &quot;super&quot;s.</p><p>First of all, I would glady agree that what I call a &quot;major third&quot; in<br/>a typical neo-medieval tuning system is actually a &quot;supermajor third&quot;<br/>in a usual naming system, and that a reader should feel free to<br/>supply the implicit prefix &quot;_super_major third&quot; at every mention.</p><p>While your system of nomenclature is especially well thought out and<br/>crafted, seeking to optimize both descriptiveness and consistency<br/>insofar as possible, I would emphasize that this question goes beyond<br/>specific systems such as yours and Scala&apos;s. If we took a poll of a<br/>large number of xenharmonicists, I suspect we&apos;d find that many more<br/>would tend to define &quot;a major third&quot; as around 4:5 rather than 64:81,<br/>11:14, or 7:9, etc., with the latter ratios as &quot;Pythagorean&quot; or<br/>&quot;supermajor.&quot;</p><p>What my frequent use of &quot;major third&quot; as a synonymous for &quot;supermajor<br/>third&quot; may reflect is the large proportion of time that I spend in<br/>neo-medieval tunings where regular or &quot;usual&quot; thirds may range from<br/>about 408 to 440 cents, or roughly Pythagorean to septimal (excellent<br/>descriptive terms for the regions around 64:81 and 7:9).</p><p>Here I &quot;take it as implicit&quot; that a major third is actually<br/>&quot;supermajor&quot; in the more conventional nomenclature, and would have no<br/>problem with a statement like this:</p><p>           Here we have a minor seventh sonority -- or, in<br/>           more familiar terms, a subminor seventh sonority --<br/>           quite close to a just 12:14:18:21.</p><p>Mainly I want to confirm your point that &quot;supermajor third&quot; would<br/>indeed be a standard description for my &quot;neo-Gothic major third.&quot; The<br/>second term is a stylistic norm, while the first is a description as<br/>part of a larger intonational map designed to name intervals in a<br/>range of systems.</p><p>By the way, an interesting question: about where in the spectrum does<br/>an interval become &quot;supermajor&quot; or &quot;subminor&quot;? For example, could<br/>Pythagorean be roughly a dividing line between &quot;major/minor&quot; and<br/>&quot;supermajor/subminor&quot; categories? Like the neutral third question you<br/>raise, this could invite some discussion.</p><p>&gt; So, Margo, Paul, Joseph or anyone,</p><p>&gt; How about neutral thirds? How do you define them? Does their size<br/>&gt; depend on what scale they are in (e.g. how many whatevers generate<br/>&gt; them) or how it is notated?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d say a good definition would be 351 +-8 cents.</p><p>While various definitions are possible here, I might say that my own<br/>customary definition is almost identical to yours when translated into<br/>cents: from around 32:39 (about 342.48 cents) to 13:16 (about 359.47<br/>cents). Maybe I&apos;d call this the &quot;classic neutral&quot; zone, leaving open<br/>the qualification that thirds over a considerably wider region can<br/>have &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;neutral-like&quot; qualities.</p><p>For example, I&apos;d consider a regular temperament around 704.61 cents as<br/>having &quot;supraminor/submajor thirds&quot; (taking the Scala categories) at<br/>around 341.46 cents and 363.14 cents. By your definition, or mine,<br/>these are just about on the border of the central &quot;neutral&quot; zone.</p><p>Just how the &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;supraminor/submajor&quot; categories (the<br/>latter represented in Scala terms by 14:17:21) relate or overlap is a<br/>question open to lots of viewpoints and discussions, but maybe this<br/>quick response may give you a first impression as to how I have often<br/>approached the problem.</p><p>Also, you raise a noteworthy point: while I use the term &quot;major third&quot;<br/>for intervals ranging from around 5:4 to around 9:7, depending on the<br/>tuning system, the &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;supraminor/submajor&quot; categories are<br/>considerably more specific.</p><p>Again, although I may sometimes rather casually invoke &quot;the chain of<br/>fifths&quot; as an explanation, musical context might be a better approach<br/>in explaning why I&apos;m following the chain of fifths.</p><p>Please let me thank you for an opportunity to qualify some of my<br/>previous statements, to compare notes, and also very warmly to invite<br/>more dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
