I apologize<br/>to anyone offended by the low level of my questions on this list.  Please<br/>provide references when you tell me where to go :)</p><p>1.    For illustrative purposes, I&apos;ll use a small prime limit JI, starting<br/>in C.  If I play a C major chord, the E is played about 14 cents lower than<br/>12TET.  If I move to a E major (using non-diatonic note for the 3rd (I don&apos;t<br/>know if non-diatonic is the right word in this case)), holding the E, does<br/>one usually (i) keep the E at that position and adjust each of the other<br/>notes accordingly so their intervals are identical to the original C major<br/>chord, or (ii) shift the E down slightly and keep the intervals the same so<br/>that there is less &quot;drift&quot; over time, or (iii) use the intervals for the E<br/>major that are implied by the original .   And if I move to a C major again,<br/>would I use the C in the original pitch, or the pitch based on E as being<br/>the last &quot;tonic&quot; (I use the word loosely) (ie:  is it like modulating keys<br/>when one changes chords, or does one stay within the original C tuning?</p><p>And what if two notes are held from a previous chord.  If they form a<br/>different interval in the two chords, which is almost always the case, one<br/>or both have to shift.  Any recommendations?</p><p>Another example: if I modulated keys in fifths around the full circle, would<br/>I accumulate the 2 cent discrepancy all the way around so that I would be 24<br/>cents off from my previous C when I get back to it, or would I somehow shift<br/>pitch slightly at convenient places to try and stop the drift?  If shifting<br/>is the answer, any recommendations for good places or ways to do it?</p><p>My prejudice:  for maximum harmony, I was intending on playing each new<br/>chord as if the root of that chord is the 1 of the JI scale.   So chord<br/>changes change the tuning of all the keys - like one would expect with<br/>modulation.  The only problem is this means the tuning actually becomes<br/>quite fluid, with intervals always &quot;correct&quot;, but no consistent pitches for<br/>notes.  Or another way to look at it is I&apos;ld always be playing an<br/>approximation of a small prime limit JI subset of a large note scale (like<br/>53 circle of primes or something).</p><p>2.  I&apos;ve seen an old article in Electronic Musician talk about playing<br/>melodies differently than harmonies (ie: using different tunings).<br/>Unfortunately, the article was short, imprecise, and all that, and I haven&apos;t<br/>seen mention of this anywhere else.  I presume he means unacommpanied<br/>melodies, since any accompanied melodies have harmony?  Any info on what is<br/>often done here?  I understand the physical basis for using small prime<br/>limit JI for harmonic situations.  Are there physical basis for melodic<br/>intervals as opposed to harmonic?</p><p>Perhaps such melodic intervals are the appropriate interval to be used for<br/>chord changes and modulation if the root or 1 position is not held from a<br/>previous chord?</p><p>All recommendations, relevant references, etc. are greatly welcomed.</p><p>Jim Savage</p></div><h3>PERLICH@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</h3><span>11/7/1999 1:56:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jim Savage wrote,</p><p>&gt;1.

Can you please<br/>give some ratios, etc. to clarify?</p><p>&gt;And if I move to a C major again,<br/>&gt;would I use the C in the original pitch, or the pitch based on E as being<br/>&gt;the last &quot;tonic&quot; (I use the word loosely) (ie:  is it like modulating keys<br/>&gt;when one changes chords, or does one stay within the original C tuning?</p><p>That is controversial -- we&apos;ve had some debate on this topic in the last few<br/>months. My view is that works of classical music operate on a sort of medium-term<br/>pitch memory (of which perfect pitch would be the long-term analogy) and so when<br/>the music returns to the home key, the musical effect is lost unless the final<br/>pitch is quite close to the original pitch. There are works of Mozart which would<br/>drift downward by almost half an octave if strict JI were adhered to in all<br/>comma-dependent progressions (including, but not limited to, modulations) and<br/>that drift would certainly destroy the feeling of &quot;return,&quot; as well as a host of<br/>other pitch-memory dependent features on shorter scales.</p><p>&gt;And what if two notes are held from a previous chord.  If they form a<br/>&gt;different interval in the two chords, which is almost always the case, one<br/>&gt;or both have to shift.  Any recommendations?</p><p>Again, please give some specific examples. In general, some shift is appropriate<br/>if it results in greater consonance for the two chords, but the shift should not<br/>be so abrupt as to be noticeable. John deLaubenfels has recently discussed<br/>various strategies for subtly &quot;sliding&quot; pitches into tune.</p><p>&gt;Another example: if I modulated keys in fifths around the full circle, would<br/>&gt;I accumulate the 2 cent discrepancy all the way around so that I would be 24<br/>&gt;cents off from my previous C when I get back to it, or would I somehow shift<br/>&gt;pitch slightly at convenient places to try and stop the drift?  If shifting<br/>&gt;is the answer, any recommendations for good places or ways to do it?</p><p>Again, I feel that pitch memory is important in classical music, but in this case<br/>the discrepancies are so small that almost any strategy would be acceptable. By<br/>contrast, a doo-wop song from the 50&apos;s, with a I-vi-ii-V progression<br/>repeated over and over, with no modulation, would drift down 22 cents each time<br/>the progression went around, if you kept all common tones and tuned each chord in<br/>JI. That could add up to a huge drift over the course of the song, which would be<br/>totally unacceptable. See the archive from a few months back on the subject<br/>&quot;adaptive JI&quot; for a discussion of strategies to prevent this drift.</p><p>&gt;My prejudice:  for maximum harmony, I was intending on playing each new<br/>&gt;chord as if the root of that chord is the 1 of the JI scale.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t work so well for certain chords. For example, a C6/9 chord<br/>(C E G A D) would have the fifth between A and D as 40:27 if you tuned it<br/>according to &quot;the JI major scale&quot; on C, and an Am7add11 chord (A C E G D) would<br/>have the fifth between G and D as 40:27 if you tuned it according to &quot;the JI<br/>minor scale&quot; on A.</p><p>&gt;So chord<br/>&gt;changes change the tuning of all the keys - like one would expect with<br/>&gt;modulation.  The only problem is this means the tuning actually becomes<br/>&gt;quite fluid, with intervals always &quot;correct&quot;, but no consistent pitches for<br/>&gt;notes.  Or another way to look at it is I&apos;ld always be playing an<br/>&gt;approximation of a small prime limit JI subset of a large note scale (like<br/>&gt;53 circle of primes or something).</p><p>Circle of primes? You mean circle of fifths? Anyway, most common-practice music<br/>can be played in meantone temperament, which would require only 21 notes per<br/>octave if the music contains no double-sharps or double-flats, and all the<br/>consonant intervals would be less than 6 cents out-of-tune. There would be no<br/>drift due to progression or modulation, except if you tried to go all the way<br/>around a circle of 12 fifths, such as from F# to Gb. That&apos;s not nearly as common<br/>as the &quot;syntonic&quot; type of drift. So to perform most music in JI, you could use<br/>meantone temperament as your basis, correct the 6-cent errors on the fly if<br/>desired, and for the most part not have to worry about drift.</p><p>&gt;2.  I&apos;ve seen an old article in Electronic Musician talk about playing<br/>&gt;melodies differently than harmonies (ie: using different tunings).<br/>&gt;Unfortunately, the article was short, imprecise, and all that, and I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt;seen mention of this anywhere else.  I presume he means unacommpanied<br/>&gt;melodies, since any accompanied melodies have harmony?  Any info on what is<br/>&gt;often done here?  I understand the physical basis for using small prime<br/>&gt;limit JI for harmonic situations.  Are there physical basis for melodic<br/>&gt;intervals as opposed to harmonic?</p><p>If you look at most musical cultures where melody is accompanied, you see a wide<br/>variety of scales. These scales tend to have reasonably good (by harmonic<br/>standards) octaves, fourths, and fifths, but the thirds and sixths are peculiar<br/>to local tradition and show no correlation with any simple-integer ratio basis.<br/>Simply put, unaccompanied melody should be modeled by 3-limit JI at most. Ratios<br/>of 5 and higher have no influence over a purely melodic music. I would agree with<br/>Johnny Reinhard that Pythagorean tuning is ideal for diatonic melody when<br/>divorced from harmonic considerations. However, 5-limit harmonic considerations<br/>are a part of Western musical culture since 1480, so any unaccompanied melody<br/>written in the West during that period would be influenced by this harmonic<br/>environment.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps such melodic intervals are the appropriate interval to be used for<br/>&gt;chord changes and modulation if the root or 1 position is not held from a<br/>&gt;previous chord?</p><p>The only melodic intervals that really have any &quot;pull&quot; as to tuning are<br/>the octave, fourth, and fifth, as well as whetever intervals are familiar due to<br/>context and/or culture. Depending on the particular example of what you are<br/>describing (care to provide an example?), melodic considerations may or may not<br/>be able to determine the &quot;correct&quot; interval for such changes.</p></div>
