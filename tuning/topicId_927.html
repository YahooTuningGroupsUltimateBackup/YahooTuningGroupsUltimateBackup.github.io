When the string is hit, the contact between the hammer and player<br/>has already been broken, so really, the only control a pianist has over the<br/>string&apos;s envelope is how hard they hit the key.<br/>    This sounds like percussion parameters to me.<br/>( I know, pianos have pedals etc. but that is just more mechanical stuff).<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=929 href="#929">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/1999 5:40:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I got the impression that the piano is techincally classifed as a<br/>&gt;percussion instrument.

If the<br/>taxonomy is based on playing technique, then the piano is a strucked<br/>instrument in a string subclass, if it is based on the sounding material,<br/>then it is a stringed instrument in a strucked subclass. If one pays closer<br/>attention to the spectrum of the instrument, one might be tempted to<br/>classify it as an idiophone, in that the stiff wires behave somewhat like<br/>bars. Some organologists even use a &apos;keyboard&apos; category, lumping together<br/>plucked and struck stringed instruments with keyboard aerophones like the<br/>organ or accordion and electronic keyboard instruments.</p><p>Personally, recognizing that the taxonomy of musical instruments is an art<br/>rather than a science, I would prefer to group instruments according to<br/>their functions in real musical contexts. Historically, although struck and<br/>possessing the powerful resource of a sustain pedal,, piano (and before it,<br/>clavichord)  performance and compositional technique developed essentially<br/>from the technique of plucked instruments, directly from the harpsichord<br/>which was itself one step removed from the lute.  (Consider the direct line<br/>of evolution from the continental lute tradition to the clavecin works of<br/>the Couperins and on to salon piano of Chopin).  In my opinion, it is<br/>really in the 20th century -- let&apos;s say starting with Debussy --  that the<br/>piano comes into its own as a percussion instrument with the adoption of<br/>techiques wildly divergent from the plucked tradition</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div><h3><a id=958 href="#958">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/1999 10:35:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ed Foote wrote:</p><p>&gt;the only control a pianist has over the<br/>string&apos;s envelope is how hard they hit the key. &lt;</p><p>Isn&apos;t it more to the point to characterize this as control over the<br/>velocity of the key stroke?</p><p>Good players also do some subtle things with the timings of repeated notes<br/>or in combination with the pedal that do have a real effect over the<br/>envelope. To bring this back to the mainstream of the tuning list, if the<br/>player is listening to the beating rates of unison courses and intervals in<br/>making such timing decisions, the performance can be very much enhanced.</p></div><h3><a id=979 href="#979">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Allan Holdsworth is the<br/>guitarist, but also plays violin on one track, and is astounding! It<br/>blows my mind that someone could achieve such a high level of technical<br/>prowess on two different instruments. (Eddie Jobson plays keyboards and<br/>violin, but Holdsworth&apos;s a notch higher on the virtuosic technique<br/>scale; I know Tony McAlpine is supposed to be quite the<br/>guitarist/keyboardist, but I haven&apos;t heard him, and good violin playing<br/>impresses me more because of pitch control -- even one or two of the<br/>most famous classical violinists are often off by a quarter-tone.)</p></div><h3><a id=980 href="#980">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/1999 6:47:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Paul H.
