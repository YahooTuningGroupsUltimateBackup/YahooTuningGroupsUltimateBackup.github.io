Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2000 4:44:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like to clarify what may have been an<br/>unfortunately not so transparent attempt at humor in comparing my<br/>classic 16th-century keyboard scheme of 15 notes per octave for<br/>5-limit just intonation (JI) with your elegant variable-note scheme.</p><p>Here the humor was that my &quot;classic&quot; 15-note fixed-pitch scheme a la<br/>Zarlino (1558) obviously involves unconcealed comma shifts of a full<br/>syntonic comma or 81:80 (~21.51 cents) -- in contrast to the much<br/>smaller shifts involved in your implementation.</p><p>Reflecting on the very serious compliment that someone offered in<br/>commenting that your rendition sounded as if it had been made on a<br/>&quot;fixed pitch instrument,&quot; I meant simply to quip, &quot;and in fact with<br/>much smaller and smoother shifts than on some 16th-century JI<br/>keyboards!&quot;</p><p>More seriously, and as a timely reassurance in a forum where questions<br/>of &quot;historical authenticity&quot; can generate some appreciable<br/>controversy, I would hasten to add that I did _not_ mean to imply that<br/>your scheme, or more generally any algorithm leading to shifts of less<br/>than a syntonic comma, is &quot;too smooth&quot; for the music &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Of course, Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI scheme of 1555 with shifts of only<br/>around 1/4 syntonic comma (~5.38 cents), also presented here by Paul<br/>Erlich, would likewise be &quot;inauthentic&quot; by such a test.</p><p>As for the possibly synonymous nature of COFT and unequal<br/>well-temperaments of late 17th to mid-19th centuries, I need to look<br/>more carefully at articles about COFT -- but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised<br/>if they turn out to be similar concepts.</p><p>Again, my congratulations, with regrets for any confusion caused by my<br/>attempt at humor.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
