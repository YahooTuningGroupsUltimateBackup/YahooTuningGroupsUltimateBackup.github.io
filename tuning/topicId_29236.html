Zarlino or prior to<br/>&gt; Zarlino?  Or there is no known source?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rami Vitale</p><p>Rami - here&apos;s a copy of something I wrote before to the list on this:</p><p>----------------<br/>Fogliano, in _Musica Theorica_, 1529, already presents a C-c species for<br/>his monochord tuning. He acknowledges Ptolemy, and sets it out like<br/>this:</p><p>C    D   E     F   G    A   B<br/> 10:9 9:8 16:15 9:8 10:9 9:8 16:15</p><p>         |_____|___|____|<br/>      (Ptolemy&apos;s diaton syntonon)</p><p>This same tuning can be found even earlier, in _Musica practica_ by<br/>Ramos de Pareja of Bologna, in 1482. He lays it out from A-a though.<br/>His student Spataro reported that he arrived at this division<br/>independently from Ptolemy.  It&apos;s indeed unlikely Ramos would have had<br/>access to the Greek sources.</p><p>So Zarlino, who acknowledges Fogliano as an excellent writer on music,<br/>certainly knew Fogliano sets the octave division out from C to c. He<br/>gives his division, likewise from C to c, which permutes the 9:8 and<br/>10:9 from the beginning of Fogliano&apos;s, and<br/>[snip]<br/>------------------------------------</p><p>So Zarlino was first with the one you quote (1558), but it is very similar<br/>to Fogliano&apos;s and Ramos&apos;s a little earlier. They had the &quot;bad&quot; fifth as<br/>G-D; Zarlino has it as D-A. I don&apos;t know of any writers that give G-A as<br/>9/8 and A-B as 10/9. This would make A-E the bad fifth.</p><p>Ptolemy gave as one of his tunings for a tetrachord: 16/15 9/8 10/9, but<br/>if you combine this tetrachord with one starting a 9/8 wholetone above it,<br/>as was the practice in forming octave scales, you actually do get the<br/>scale Zarlino gives.</p><p>By the way, a similar reversal of the 9/8 and 10/9 happens in a diatonic<br/>tuning of the tetrachord by Didymus (earlier than Ptolemy), who gives<br/>16/15 10/9 9/8.</p><p>Best --Jon</p></div>
