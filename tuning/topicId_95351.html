Debbie came home from work to announce that<br/>there IS some microtonal music she likes - Flamenco.&quot;</p><p>  Interesting.  From what I&apos;ve read so far, the extent of microtonality in<br/>Flamenco is limited to it&apos;s using enharmonics, especially by singer.  So it&apos;s<br/>kind of more like &quot;higher precision/adaptive JI&quot; type stuff rather than a<br/>completely new mood or feel.</p><p>  Far as blues...someone like Neil would probably be more of an expert...but I<br/>recall there are only two microtones used...between the major/minor 3rd and the<br/>major/minor 7th...inherited from African music which blends between major and<br/>minor scales.  Plus they are used almost exclusively in melody, and not in<br/>chords (at least in standard Blues).  It&apos;s funny, in contrast, you say<br/>&quot;microtonal harmony is a sticking point&quot;...I&apos;ve always heard it as merely being<br/>things like single-neighboring-tone bends done with clockwork precision by<br/>artist like BB King...but generally never of entire held chords.</p></div>
