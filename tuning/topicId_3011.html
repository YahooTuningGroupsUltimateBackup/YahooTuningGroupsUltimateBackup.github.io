I am much lazier and prefer to just do the above as:</p><p>    A    E    B<br/>  F    C    G    D</p><p>but you are most welcome to reproduce everything in 3D.</p><p>&gt;[Tomes]<br/>&gt;&gt; To determine the frequencies for G multiply all the above<br/>&gt;&gt; by 3/2 and the only note that actually shifts is A which shifts<br/>&gt;&gt; by 81/80 ratio which I assume is the 9/8 vs 10/9 discussion.<br/>&gt;&gt; I say that this note should shift by that ratio.</p><p>&gt;Following your math to the letter:</p><p>&gt;                          40.5 A<br/>&gt;                            /<br/>&gt;               67.5 F#     /<br/>&gt;                 / &apos;-._   /<br/>&gt;                /      54 D<br/>&gt;               /        /<br/>&gt;            45 B       /<br/>&gt;             / &apos;-._   /<br/>&gt;            /      36 G<br/>&gt;           /        /<br/>&gt;        60 E       /<br/>&gt;            &apos;-._  /<br/>&gt;                48 C</p><p>&gt;First of all, you surely don&apos;t mean to have decimal points<br/>&gt;in your *ratios* (not that it&apos;s going to affect the final<br/>&gt;result, but still...).</p><p>You are right that it is messy and also that it makes no difference.<br/>I have a tendency to reduce all notes to the 24 to 48 range of ratios<br/>and accept things like 40.5 knowing what it means.  Of course that is<br/>only personal taste and almost certainly not someone else&apos;s taste.<br/>Please excuse my bad habits.</p><p>&gt;Since you&apos;re assuming &apos;octave&apos;-equivalence anyway (i.e.,<br/>&gt;ignoring powers of 2), I find it much simpler to use the<br/>&gt;prime-factor notation:</p><p>Absolutely.  However it is useful to present things in several different<br/>ways because they highlight different aspects of what is going on.  The<br/>diagrams are great but are a lot of work and can get overcomplicated<br/>when we start doing all primes up to 13.  In that case the prime-factor<br/>notation is the only way to go.</p><p>However I also do make a case in a recent post for non-equivalence of<br/>octaves.</p><p>&gt;A comparison of these two tables makes it very easy<br/>&gt;to see which notes have changed and which haven&apos;t:</p><p>&gt;&apos;C major&apos;:       &apos;G major&apos;:</p><p>&gt;fac. 3  5        fac.  3  5<br/>&gt;-----------      ------------<br/>&gt;B  | 2  1 |      B   | 2  1 |<br/>&gt;A  | 0  1 |      A   | 4  0 |<br/>&gt;G  | 2  0 |      G   | 2  0 |<br/>&gt;                 F#  | 3  1 |<br/>&gt;F  | 0  0 |<br/>&gt;E  | 1  1 |      E   | 1  1 |<br/>&gt;D  | 3  0 |      D   | 3  0 |<br/>&gt;C  | 1  0 |      C   | 1  0 |</p><p>&gt;There are two notes which &apos;shift&apos; here:</p><p>&gt;The obvious metamorphosis (which you didn&apos;t even mention)<br/>&gt;is the shift of F ( 0  0 )  to  F# ( 3  1 ).</p><p>Yeah, I asumed that everyone knew about that  ;^)</p><p>&gt;The subtle one, which you did point out, is the shift of<br/>&gt;A ( 0  1 )  to  A ( 4  0 ).</p><p>And another notation for that is the 81/80 shift which is what I always<br/>think of this as.  Hey, I know things have proper music names but I am<br/>not really a musician (should I really mention this when I am trying to<br/>revolutionise music theory?  answer: might as well, as it is obvious<br/>anyway).</p><p>As regards the answer to &quot;what&apos;s the problem?&quot; I would just say that I<br/>answered already a couple of very similar ones and so hopefully these<br/>will give the flavour of what I believe.  In general I would say that<br/>the individual chords should be consonant and that there will be some<br/>place where something gives and a note does the 80/81 thing between<br/>successive chords (or held notes).  If the music is made tight enough so<br/>that this doesn&apos;t happen then the composer successfully negotiated a way<br/>to move the scale by a 81/80 ratio and all power to him for that.<br/>Nobody cares if you move it by 9/8 intentionally so why shouldn&apos;t you<br/>move by 81/80 if your heart is really set on it.</p><p>Sideline: If music really follows the subtle cycles in nature (as I<br/>believe, and as supported by some composers saying they just listen)<br/>then such things will not really happen in natural music.  Or, if they<br/>do they will likely return but not keep wandering off as (81/80)^n.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve frequently created JI chord progressions that looked<br/>&gt;good on paper, and I thought would sound great, and the<br/>&gt;individual chords *did* sound great.  But put them all together,<br/>&gt;and... yuk!</p><p>This is where I think my post on the big field of music comes into its<br/>own.  I have used the matrix space rather than the prime notation<br/>(although I did that previously just to allow several ways to look at<br/>it) because then it is very clear what sort of distances are involved in<br/>any given leap.  It is my opinion that using this big field (or the<br/>prime factorisations which is the same thing) and understanding that<br/>changing the index of higher primes is much more severe than changing<br/>the index of lower primes allows the correct decision to be made in all<br/>cases.  Of course clever Charlie&apos;s will find borderline cases.  These<br/>will have their own special attractions.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
