He is well versed in<br/>matters concerning frequency discrimination.<br/>    The following is his comment.<br/>    Lewis</p><p>    The only way I know to do this is to use a linear array of detectors and<br/>clock the detectors in phase so that you pinpoint a<br/>    source.  This would allow you to zero in on a particular player in an<br/>orchestra.  This would not work with a<br/>    a typical (stereo) recording, the trick is having the multiple detector<br/>(phase) info.  A DFT would separate a bass from a<br/>    piccolo, but it would not distinguish between two violins.  The simplest<br/>scheme is two highly directional mikes, one scanning the<br/>    x direction and one scanning the y direction.  Note that I am emphasizing<br/>the recording end of it.  It would be extremely difficult to<br/>    use electronics to pull a single voice out of a stereo recording of a group.<br/>Again, you would have to use a phasing technique.</p><p>     Dan CC</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From:     <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a> at Internet<br/>Sent:     Friday, March 05, 1999 7:25 PM<br/>To:     <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a> at internet<br/>Subject:     [tuning] sound analysis software</p><p>From: Joseph L Monzo &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a>&gt;</p><p>[Rick Tagawa:]<br/>&gt; I called SOUNDVIEW  today . . . the software<br/>&gt; can show the sound spectrum but can&apos;t break<br/>&gt; a sound up into its component voices . . . for<br/>&gt; instance, it wouldn&apos;t work with a symphony orchestra.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He mentioned that he didn&apos;t know of any software<br/>&gt; that could do that.</p><p>Brian McLaren gave me a very thorough explanation<br/>of why it can&apos;t be done with our present technology.<br/>I can&apos;t explain most of it, but I recall that he said<br/>there are apparently 3 main ways we process<br/>the differentiation of separate voices and their<br/>pitches.</p><p>When his website finally goes online, be ready<br/>to ask him (or send him a snail mail).</p><p>- Monzo</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Have you visited our new web site?<br/><a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>Onelist: Helping to create Internet communities<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>You do not need web access to participate.
