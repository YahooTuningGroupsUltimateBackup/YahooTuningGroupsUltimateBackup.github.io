If we take a Fokker block based on the<br/>12-et commas 36/35, 81/80, and 126/125 and temper it via the 108-et, we<br/>get a 126/125-tempered scale with very nice<br/>properties, one of which is that it can serve as a temperament. The scale<br/>is<br/>[0, 11, 17, 28, 35, 45, 52, 63, 73, 80, 91, 97], and its circle of<br/>seven-step intervals is<br/>[63, 62, 63, 63, 62, 63, 67, 62, 63, 63, 62, 63]. This gives us eight<br/>fifths equal to the common 12-et fifth, and four very flat but still<br/>usable fifths, and one sharp wolf. The result *on average* is about<br/>2/7-comma meantone, but it really is quite different, with a great many<br/>intervals and chords quite accurately tuned. This is what I called<br/>Wreckmeister B.</p><p>Similarly, if we take the Ellis duodene and temper it by the 72-et, we<br/>get<br/>[0, 7, 12, 19, 23, 30, 35, 42, 49, 53, 61, 65]; it has a 7-step circle<br/>[42, 42, 41, 42, 42, 42, 44, 42, 42, 42, 41, 42]. This has 9 12-et<br/>fifths, and two very, cheesy, very very flat fifths, and a sharp wolf. On<br/>average, it is about 3/13 comma meantone, but it is even farther from<br/>being average. However, it *does* do the 225/224 thing very well, and has<br/>many 72-et tuned chords and intervals. It can, more or less, be<br/>considered a temperament.</p><p>Finally, what about Wreckmeister A? This is the block which is three<br/>major triads by four minor triads square, tempered by the 108-et. The<br/>scale is [0, 7, 21, 28, 35, 45, 56, 63, 73, 80, 91, 101], and the 7-step<br/>circle is<br/>[63, 66, 59, 63, 66, 63, 59, 66, 63, 63, 62, 63]. While I called this a<br/>temperament also, I was not being serious; but it *can* be used as a<br/>retuning. What gets me about it is that the results can be very<br/>interesting, as in my Beethoven quartet example, which really sends me.<br/>Maybe I&apos;m just weird, but it seems to have some kind of mojo going that<br/>other retunings I&apos;ve tried don&apos;t.</p></div><h3><a id=37186 href="#37186">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 3:17:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gene W Smith &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; This gives us eight<br/>&gt; fifths equal to the common 12-et fifth, and four very flat but still<br/>&gt; usable fifths, and one sharp wolf.</p><p>that&apos;s thirteen altogther. in a twelve-tone tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, what about Wreckmeister A?
