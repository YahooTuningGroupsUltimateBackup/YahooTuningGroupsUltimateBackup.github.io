But I must do<br/>what needs to be done...!</p><p>Mavila has a terrible naming crisis going on - I&apos;ve heard it sometimes<br/>called &quot;mavila&quot; and sometimes &quot;pelogic,&quot; and then it has a ton of<br/>7-limit extensions with different and often conflicting names. I&apos;ve<br/>seen at least two temperaments called &quot;pelogic,&quot; and one called<br/>&quot;hexadecimal/pelogic,&quot; and then I see people calling it &quot;Armodue&quot; and<br/>&quot;Hornbostel&quot; as well on the XA. It&apos;s a terrible mess as it stands, so<br/>in order to sort this out, I propose the following naming convention,<br/>which more or less splits the mavila umbrella into extensions<br/>supported by 9-equal, 16-equal, and 23(d)-equal. My goal is that when<br/>people talk about &quot;armodue&quot; and &quot;hornbostel&quot; and &quot;pelogic&quot; and<br/>&quot;mavila,&quot; they can actually be talking about specific rank-2<br/>temperaments that are subtly consistent with their usage, rather than<br/>having the mishmosh of inconsistency that we do now.</p><p>1) &quot;Mavila&quot; is the base 5-limit 135/128 temperament. Anything that<br/>calls the basic, 5-limit, rank-2 135/128 temperament &quot;pelogic&quot; should<br/>just be changed to avoid confusion. This is basically a moot point<br/>these days, as everyone in the community calls it &quot;mavila&quot; now, so<br/>this mainly has to do with identifying and fixing cruft.<br/>2) &quot;Armodue&quot; is the 36/35 7-limit extension, of which 16-equal is a<br/>good tuning. Since many on here don&apos;t know what &quot;Armodue&quot; is, I&apos;ll go<br/>into greater detail below. This one&apos;s currently called either<br/>&quot;Hexadecimal&quot; or &quot;Hexadecimal/Pelogic&quot; or &quot;Pelogic&quot; depending on where<br/>you look.<br/>3) &quot;Pelogic&quot; is the 21/20 extension, which 9-equal supports. This one<br/>is currently just called 7-limit &quot;mavila&quot;, but it&apos;s worthwhile to<br/>switch it up for reasons explained below.<br/>4) &quot;Hornbostel&quot; is the as of yet unnamed 126/125 extension, because of<br/>its relevance to 23-equal, specifically the 23d val which is optimal<br/>in that it has the lowest TOP-RMS error. I&apos;m sure we&apos;re going to start<br/>arguing over patent vals vs TOP-RMS optimal vals here.</p><p>These are the 4 main 7-limit extensions of mavila and, in certain<br/>ways, they&apos;re more or less consistent with the terminology that&apos;s<br/>being used in the community. The 64/63 and 28/27 extensions, for some<br/>reason, keep popping up on the temperament finder, but I have no idea<br/>what to name them or why they&apos;re relevant.</p><p>(2) The most important of these is Armodue, which gets the 36/35<br/>extension and goes in the direction of 16-equal. There is no reason to<br/>make this name change and the only reason this wasn&apos;t called &quot;armodue&quot;<br/>from the start is that we didn&apos;t know what Armodue was until recently.<br/>The Armodue theory is a theory of 16-equal based out of Italy that<br/>seems to have been around since at least 2002 (see here:<br/><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712205920/http://www.armodue.com/">http://web.archive.org/web/20010712205920/http://www.armodue.com/</a>).<br/>It&apos;s one of the few solid, practical, concrete theories available for<br/>a specific tuning other than 12, and is very effective in breaking<br/>16-equal down into a simple theory that people can digest and<br/>understand and make practical music with.</p><p>We haven&apos;t heard much about it on this list since the site&apos;s entirely<br/>in Italian, but the theory&apos;s gained somewhat of a following and there<br/>are some adherents on the XA Facebook group, who generally call mavila<br/>itself &quot;armodue.&quot; Despite that Armodue is supposedly a theory of<br/>16-equal specifically, it&apos;s obvious that the main focus with it is<br/>really as a chromatic scale for mavila, as every aspect of it is more<br/>or less based on mavila[9] (use of mavila[9] as a &quot;superdiatonic&quot;<br/>scale, nominal naming convention of 1-9, 9+7 keyboard layout,<br/>mavila-based staff notation, etc).</p><p>Armodue&apos;s take on mavila is distinguished from others by focusing on a<br/>specific 7-limit mavila extension that emphasizes that the interval<br/>between &quot;1&quot; and &quot;8&quot; is an approximation to 7/4, which means 36/35<br/>vanishes. This temperament seems to be called &quot;Hexadecimal/Pelogic&quot; on<br/>the xenwiki and elsewhere just &quot;Pelogic&quot; as it stands now. However, as<br/>the Armodue name has historic precedence over all of these, and as the<br/>&quot;armodue&quot; name is already in common use, it makes the most sense to<br/>give this the title of armodue temperament, of which 33/32 and 65/64<br/>serve for excellent extensions compatible with 16-equal. I doubt there<br/>will be any objections to this, as it&apos;s clear Armodue was here first,<br/>and this extension now has an inconsistent mishmosh of names, so I&apos;m<br/>going to make a change and call it done.</p><p>(3) I&apos;m calling the 21/20 extension, which is supported by 9-equal,<br/>&quot;pelogic.&quot; The word &quot;pelogic&quot; has a pretty strange history in that it<br/>can&apos;t seem to find a mapping that hasn&apos;t been discovered before under<br/>a different name, but in a lot of ways the 21/20 extension is the most<br/>sensible.</p><p>The 135/128 temperament, which was originally called &quot;pelogic,&quot; and<br/>the 36/35 extension, which is in some places called &quot;pelogic&quot; but<br/>others &quot;hexadecimal&quot; or &quot;hexadecimal/pelogic,&quot; both have their names<br/>usurped by earlier discoveries (mavila and armodue respectively).<br/>However, there should still be an official &quot;pelogic&quot; temperament, not<br/>just a hangover from an earlier names, and not one with a haphazard<br/>naming convention too. When people talk about &quot;pelog&quot; or &quot;pelogic&quot; in<br/>contrast to the usual standpoint, especially when they&apos;re coming more<br/>from an ethnomusicological standpoint, they&apos;re usually talking about<br/>something flatter than 16 or 23-equal, more like 9-equal. And since<br/>9-equal is often cited as being fairly close to how actual pelog music<br/>is tuned, our &quot;pelogic&quot; temperament should be supported by 9-equal.</p><p>Of course, pelog music doesn&apos;t have much to do with actual 7-limit<br/>ratios, so our goal with this is basically to find a mapping that<br/>flattens the fifth more than just normal mavila, and call it &quot;pelogic&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;pelog&quot; as a result to signify that this is mimicry of a<br/>&quot;natural&quot; tuning within the regular temperament paradigm. And for this<br/>goal, an obvious solution presents itself: 21/20-tempering really does<br/>a number on the fifths, even more effectively than 36/35-tempering.<br/>This is actually the lowest-badness 7-limit extension of mavila, so it<br/>makes double sense to assign the &quot;pelogic&quot; name, which is historically<br/>important on this list, to an important extension like that. It&apos;s<br/>compatible with 9-equal, which is a triple plus. And, finally, if<br/>you&apos;re the kind of guy who likes to imagine that cultures gravitate<br/>towards low-badness tunings, then you can use that argument too...<br/>kind of.</p><p>(4) Hornbostel is the original 23-equal guy. While his concept of<br/>&quot;blown fifths&quot; has since been technically debunked, his work is still<br/>inspiring in his approach to ethnomusicology, and he should get some<br/>credit for predicting mavila in some form. There are a few people on<br/>XA who keep referring to 23-equal as &quot;Hornbostel&quot; and to mavila[7] in<br/>general as &quot;Hornbostel&quot; or the &quot;Hornbostel&quot; scale. I don&apos;t think his<br/>work with 23-equal ever went beyond the 3-limit, so this is more of a<br/>tribute than a description of an actual temperament he predicted. And<br/>whatever temperament gets the &quot;Hornbostel&quot; name should be more or less<br/>consistent with the way that the 7-limit is used in 23-equal.</p><p>23-equal has really good 7/6&apos;s, though the rest of the 7-limit isn&apos;t<br/>that great. In general, 23-equal is ambiguous in the 7-limit and<br/>presents 2 vals: 23d, where 49/48 vanishes, and 23p where 36/35<br/>vanishes. The first is the lowest error val and also gives you the<br/>good 7/6&apos;s, and anecdotally and to my ears 4:5:6:7 sounds better with<br/>the first val. The final nail in the coffin is that the second val<br/>already supports armodue temperament, which defeats the purpose of us<br/>looking for a unique 23-equal 7-limit extension for mavila in the<br/>first place. So 23d it is.</p><p>We can&apos;t eliminate 49/48 and call that &quot;Hornbostel,&quot; because the<br/>generator splits in half and this is already called &quot;superpelog.&quot; A<br/>solution presents itself in tempering out 128/125, which is a good<br/>enough extension to appear on the first page of the temperament<br/>finder. So there&apos;s your Hornbostel.</p><p>I&apos;ve made changes to the xenwiki now and I assume that Graham&apos;s<br/>temperament finder will automatically pick it up once it scrapes the<br/>changes. If anyone has any additions or can think of a better way to<br/>do things than the above feel free to weigh in.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101195 href="#101195">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2011 4:46:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, Aug 13, 2011 at 7:28 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The final nail in the coffin is that the second val<br/>&gt; already supports armodue temperament, which defeats the purpose of us<br/>&gt; looking for a unique 23-equal 7-limit extension for mavila in the<br/>&gt; first place.

But the<br/>main idea I was getting at with this is that, using armodue notation,<br/>1-2## should be 7/6. This is true in 16-equal because 6/5 and 7/6 are<br/>the same thing. But that&apos;s fine, because my underlying goal was just<br/>to come up with more fundamental linear temperaments for these<br/>differing concepts. The main thing about mavila in 23-equal is that in<br/>mavila[7], a sharpened &quot;large&quot; step is 7/6, which is what I called<br/>&quot;Hornbostel temperament.&quot;</p><p>So you can say that<br/>- 9-equal is a mavila temperament, a pelogic temperament, and an<br/>Armodue temperament, and is not a Hornbostel temperament.<br/>- 16-equal is a mavila temperament, an Armodue temperament, and a<br/>Hornbostel temperament, and is not a pelogic temperament.<br/>- 23-equal is a mavila temperament, and can be either a Hornbostel or<br/>an Armodue temperament depending on which mapping you use, and is not<br/>a pelogic temperament.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101196 href="#101196">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2011 8:23:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; We can&apos;t eliminate 49/48 and call that &quot;Hornbostel,&quot; because the<br/>&gt; generator splits in half and this is already called &quot;superpelog.&quot; A<br/>&gt; solution presents itself in tempering out 128/125, which is a good</p><p>Typo for 126/125, I assume?</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=101201 href="#101201">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2011 10:55:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The Armodue theory is a theory of 16-equal based out of Italy</p><p>Not entirely.
