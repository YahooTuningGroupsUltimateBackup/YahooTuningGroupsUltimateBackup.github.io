Someone found a backdoor way to spam the list via<br/>the calendar and they had it set up for a daily spam. Yahoo may be in<br/>trouble, and with their new deal with Google I&apos;m not sure that they<br/>are any more, but spamming their own customers would kill any good<br/>will they might have with them.</p><p>Dave</p></div><h3><a id=77294 href="#77294">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2008 4:31:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;David Bowen&quot; &lt;dmb0317@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A few hours ago, I saw a weird message in the TL mail entitled<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Browse, get your favourite songs &amp; listen&quot;.
