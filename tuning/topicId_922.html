(BTW, I have never gotten the latter to drive my sound<br/>card-- has anyone else tried it with any success?)&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Daniel,</p><p>Yes, I have gotten chime to work.  You need a soundblaster compatible card<br/>and the help file describes the parameters required in the autoexec.bat<br/>file.  I have used the program to tune chimes, although its usefullness is<br/>limited by the lack of tuning accuracy in sound cards. You can use the &quot;pc<br/>speaker&quot; output which is quite unpleasant to listen to (but very accurate),<br/>and lacks the ability to sound multiple notes simultaneously.</p><p>It has a few quirky bugs, so if you get it working and want to use it,<br/>please contact me.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>SEJIS</p></div>
