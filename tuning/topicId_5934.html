One should not assume that only one hole was<br/>&gt; open at a time, as still other pitches could likely be produced, beyond<br/>&gt; the number of holes.  Without this information, many people will simply<br/>&gt; assume that it plays some close approximation to equal temperament.  That<br/>&gt; broken pieces of other flutes werre found at the same site would indicate<br/>&gt; that there may have been ensemble playing, with harmonic possibilities<br/>&gt; which could be of interest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Darren Burgess&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dburgess@acceleration.net">dburgess@acceleration.net</a>&gt; 11/04 9:13 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Darren Burgess&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dburgess@acceleration.net">dburgess@acceleration.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey folks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought this post from the oddmusic list may be of interest to some of<br/>&gt; you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Darren Burgess<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: &quot;Monty H.

The work of an ancient colleague unearthed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chinese archeologists have unearthed what is believed to be the oldest<br/>&gt; known playable musical instrument, a seven-holed flute fashioned 9,000<br/>&gt; years ago from the hollow wing bone of a large bird.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The instrument, about nine inches long, is the best preserved of six<br/>&gt; intact<br/>&gt; flutes found with fragments of about 30 others at Jiahu, a remarkably rich<br/>&gt; but little-known archeological site in the Yellow River valley in Henan<br/>&gt; Province in central China. Radiocarbon dating shows the site was occupied<br/>&gt; for 1,300 years beginning around 7000 B.C., during the early Neolithic<br/>&gt; period in China.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nine millennia after lips last touched it, the flute was played again and<br/>&gt; its tones analyzed. The seven holes produced a rough scale covering a<br/>&gt; modern octave, beginning close to the second A above middle C. There is<br/>&gt; evidence that the flute was tuned: a small hole drilled next to the<br/>&gt; seventh<br/>&gt; hole had the effect of raising that hole&apos;s tone from roughly G-sharp to A,<br/>&gt; completing the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
