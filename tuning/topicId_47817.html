Scientist Phil<br/>Uttley &quot;said the music of a black hole could be called improv.&quot; In &quot;comparison<br/>to a specific artist or style, he said the late Greek composer Iannis Xenakis.<br/>&quot;Scientists say music is ubiquitous in Nature (Earth itself) and shows up in<br/>the arrangements of the planets, in seascapes, and even in our brainwaves.&quot;<br/>&apos;Flicker Noise&apos; - Nature&apos;s inaudible rhythms &amp; patterns are in everything -<br/>heartbeats, climate change, X-ray outputs, in interplanetary magnetic fields....</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s the greatest achievement to be able to hear the sounds of the world,<br/>all the sounds, as part of some vast musical composition with no beginning or<br/>end, but infinite nuance, endless layers and parts in the score... Your ears are<br/>trained when you can take it all in, not just what you like to hear.&quot; - David<br/>Rothenberg</p><p>&quot;Any sufficiently advanced music is indistinguishable from noise&quot; (after<br/>Arthur C. Clarke&apos;s aphorism that any sufficiently advanced technology is<br/>indistinguisable from magic.)&quot; - John Chalmers, in email response to the quote _The<br/>Difference between Music and Noise is all in your Head_</p><p>&quot;... simple, chaotic, anarchic and menacing.... This is what people of today<br/>have lost and need most - the ability to experience permanent bodily and<br/>mental ecstasy, to be a receiving station for messages howling by on the ether from<br/>other worlds and nonhuman entities, those peculiar short-wave messages which<br/>come in static-free in the secret pleasure center in the brain.&quot; - Slava Ranko<br/>(Donald L.
