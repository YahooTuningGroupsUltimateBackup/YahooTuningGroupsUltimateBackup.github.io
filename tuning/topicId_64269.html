I enjoy using Blackjack for combination with live<br/>instruments and even with 12-equal when it is necessary (such<br/>as the piano) since I have at least the pitches C, G, D and A in<br/>common! (And, of course, other &quot;quasi just&quot; intervals from<br/>corresponding triads).  I plan to do some more experimental work with<br/>other tuning systems, but they may be entirely electronic with no<br/>notation other than that of graphic sequencer notation, if I ever<br/>wanted to project that... since live performers may not be involved.</p><p>J.

Mentioned and gave an example of the ASCII _shorthand_ (for 72-<br/>&gt; ET).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. Changed the recommended notations for the following equal<br/>&gt; divisions of the octave: 10, 13, 14, 21, 43, 53, due to feedback<br/>&gt; from users and readers, particularly Jacob Barton and Ozan Yarman.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3.

(For those<br/>&gt; who might be reading a paper copy.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. Moved the description of the extreme superset, of symbols that<br/>&gt; almost nobody except Gene Ward Smith will ever need ;-), to the very<br/>&gt; end of the article, to try to mitigate its &quot;freakout factor&quot;.

This<br/>&gt; may unfortunately require changing the font mapping, but may allow<br/>&gt; us to notate more tunings below 612-ET without using accents and may<br/>&gt; allow us to include our version of the Tartini-Couper quartertone<br/>&gt; symbols (see Figure 1). These are used in conjunction with Sagittal<br/>&gt; symbols in Herman Miller&apos;s MOS-nominal notations for (multi-)linear<br/>&gt; temperaments.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6. Mentioned the use of right accents, if needed, to differentiate<br/>&gt; 13-limit pitches from the 7-limit ones that are only 0.4 cents away<br/>&gt; (and other uses).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7.

Indeed, unison is but the re-statement of the same<br/>pitch:</p><p>If subtracting frequency A produced on a string from frequency B produced on<br/>another string yields 0, it simply means that there is NO difference and<br/>that the interval between the two frequencies is absent, which is to say<br/>that there is NO interval to speak of!</p><p>A hz - B hz = 0 = no difference = absence of any interval = unison.</p><p>Thus it is useless, redundant, or worse, in vain to speak of an &grave;interval of<br/>a unison&grave; when it is a mathematical fact that there is 0 (hence, NO)<br/>interval between the two frequencies given above.</p><p>It is like asking &grave;what is the time interval between two simultaenous<br/>events?&grave;. It is an absurd question, since the events are already stated as<br/>simultaenous. Similarly, by describing unison, we admit that the frequencies<br/>are the same - with or without octave equivalances (equating 0 cents with<br/>1200 cents) taken into consideration.</p><p>Thus, it is baseless to speak of an &grave;interval of a unison&grave;, since there is<br/>no musical interval to mention here.</p><p>Moreover, you yourself admit to the contradiction that there cannot be an<br/>&grave;augmented unison&grave;, since unison by definition is ONE SOUND.</p><p>Would you say that there are &grave;unisonic intervals&grave; between the three strings<br/>of a piano tuned to the same pitch? Would anyone say that a pianist has<br/>played the interval of a unison when he stroke a single key that sounded<br/>these three strings together?</p><p>Certainly not.

You<br/>can rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.  Or 180 degrees.  Or 270 degrees<br/>clockwise.  You can pick it up and turn it over along a horizontal,<br/>vertical, or either diagonal axis.  You can also pick it up, wave it<br/>over your head, throw it on the floor and jump over it, pick it up,<br/>and put it down 90 degrees rotated from where it started, but that<br/>(for our purposes) is considered the same thing as just rotating it.<br/>What matters is what orientation the square ends up in, not the<br/>process by which it got there.  Given that definition, the above seven<br/>transformations are *almost* all the transformations that leave a<br/>square invariant.</p><p>Now these transformations *almost* have a certain property, which is<br/>this: The result of applying any two of these transformations is the<br/>same as one of thes transformations.  For example, a clockwise<br/>rotation of 90 degrees followed by a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees<br/>is a rotation of 180 degrees.  A flip on the horizontal axis followed<br/>by a flip on a diagonal axis is a 90 or 270 degree rotation, depending<br/>on which diagonal.  (It&apos;s not the same *process* as a rotation, but it<br/>results in the same *orientation*, so it counts as the same.)  And so<br/>forth.</p><p>But... a 180 degree rotation followed by a 180 degree rotation, or a<br/>90 degree followed by a 270 degree, or a horizontal flip followed by a<br/>horizontal flip (et cetera) all leave the square oriented as it was<br/>when you started, which is no transformation at all...</p><p>Unless you define it to be yet another a tranformation, the null or<br/>identity transformation.  Why would you do so?  Because then *every*<br/>combination of these 8 transformations is one of these 8<br/>transformations, and then it becomes much easier to develop<br/>definitions and theorems about such transformations.  When you include<br/>the null transformation, these transformations, along with the<br/>operation consisting of doing one transformation followed by another,<br/>form a mathematical group.  And once you have a group, the methods and<br/>theorems of group theory can be brought to bear on the situation.</p><p>This is why, to a mathematician, doing nothing to a square counts as a<br/>transformation of that square: because by considering it so the<br/>apparatus of group theory can be used.</p><p>There are lots of other groups, finite and infinite.  For instance,<br/>the positive rational numbers, along with the operation of<br/>multiplication, form a group.</p><p>Of course, in music theory, positive rational numbers (considered as<br/>frequency ratios) correspond to just intervals, and multiplication of<br/>rational numbers corresponds to addition of intervals.  So musical<br/>intervals, and the operation of adding intervals, also form a group.</p><p>But only if the combination of any two rational intervals is a<br/>rational interval; and the combination of an upward fifth, say, and a<br/>downward fifth is a unison.  So the rational intervals form a group<br/>only if the unison is defined to be an interval.</p><p>It&apos;s not just wordplay; it&apos;s defining terms in such a way as to make<br/>things like group theory applicable to the problem.</p><p>- Rich Holmes</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2006 1:48:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Oz,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; We both agree that its usage is essential.

That<br/>is, the absence of an interval, for it means that there is no difference<br/>between the frequencies in question. It is therefore only natural to refer<br/>to this relative frequency as the reference tone.</p><p>More to the point, the first degree of a diatonical scale (prime) does not<br/>correspond an interval, since there is no mention of another note with which<br/>to compare. Unlike unison, it is a stand-alone pitch by itself. Only in<br/>&grave;augmented prime&grave; do you reproduce another instance of the same note a<br/>little further away with an accidental to form an interval.</p><p>Even sounding two instances of the same pitch on two seperate instruments,<br/>still yields no difference, and hence, no interval.

Then, I think we&apos;re trying to turn two<br/>&gt; questions into a single one and I&apos;m a bit surprised noone has pointed this<br/>&gt; out yet.<br/>&gt; Q1: Is 1/1 an interval?<br/>&gt; A1: Certainly.<br/>&gt; Q2: How should we call the 1/1?<br/>&gt; A2: Whatever your view is, here&apos;s mine.<br/>&gt; If we want to stress the fact that it&apos;s the smallest of all intervals<br/>(i.e.<br/>&gt; the first degree of a [diatonic] scale), we call it a &quot;prime&quot;. Then the<br/>&gt; second degree of a diatonic scale is a second and so on. If we want to<br/>&gt; stress the fact that the pitches of &quot;these two tones&quot; are identical, we<br/>call<br/>&gt; it a &quot;unison&quot;.<br/>&gt; So I&apos;d conclude like this: Prime is an interval. That means 1/1 is an<br/>&gt; interval. Unison is a prime taken from a different point of view. That<br/>means<br/>&gt; the word &quot;unison&quot; doesn&apos;t explain the prime as an interval of zero<br/>distance<br/>&gt; but rather as two tones of the same pitch (or one tone produced by two<br/>&gt; &quot;instruments&quot;).<br/>&gt; That&apos;s why &quot;augmented prime&quot; works OK for me, but &quot;augmented unison&quot; does<br/>&gt; not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2006 4:04:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>An interval describes a substantial quantity seperating tones from one<br/>another.

You<br/>&gt; can rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.  Or 180 degrees.  Or 270 degrees<br/>&gt; clockwise.  You can pick it up and turn it over along a horizontal,<br/>&gt; vertical, or either diagonal axis.  You can also pick it up, wave it<br/>&gt; over your head, throw it on the floor and jump over it, pick it up,<br/>&gt; and put it down 90 degrees rotated from where it started, but that<br/>&gt; (for our purposes) is considered the same thing as just rotating it.<br/>&gt; What matters is what orientation the square ends up in, not the<br/>&gt; process by which it got there.  Given that definition, the above seven<br/>&gt; transformations are *almost* all the transformations that leave a<br/>&gt; square invariant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now these transformations *almost* have a certain property, which is<br/>&gt; this: The result of applying any two of these transformations is the<br/>&gt; same as one of thes transformations.  For example, a clockwise<br/>&gt; rotation of 90 degrees followed by a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees<br/>&gt; is a rotation of 180 degrees.  A flip on the horizontal axis followed<br/>&gt; by a flip on a diagonal axis is a 90 or 270 degree rotation, depending<br/>&gt; on which diagonal.  (It&apos;s not the same *process* as a rotation, but it<br/>&gt; results in the same *orientation*, so it counts as the same.)  And so<br/>&gt; forth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But... a 180 degree rotation followed by a 180 degree rotation, or a<br/>&gt; 90 degree followed by a 270 degree, or a horizontal flip followed by a<br/>&gt; horizontal flip (et cetera) all leave the square oriented as it was<br/>&gt; when you started, which is no transformation at all...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unless you define it to be yet another a tranformation, the null or<br/>&gt; identity transformation.  Why would you do so?  Because then *every*<br/>&gt; combination of these 8 transformations is one of these 8<br/>&gt; transformations, and then it becomes much easier to develop<br/>&gt; definitions and theorems about such transformations.  When you include<br/>&gt; the null transformation, these transformations, along with the<br/>&gt; operation consisting of doing one transformation followed by another,<br/>&gt; form a mathematical group.  And once you have a group, the methods and<br/>&gt; theorems of group theory can be brought to bear on the situation.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t see the relevance of this analogy. The simpler ones I produced still<br/>expect to be refuted, provided that they can actually be refuted.</p><p>&gt; This is why, to a mathematician, doing nothing to a square counts as a<br/>&gt; transformation of that square: because by considering it so the<br/>&gt; apparatus of group theory can be used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are lots of other groups, finite and infinite.  For instance,<br/>&gt; the positive rational numbers, along with the operation of<br/>&gt; multiplication, form a group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, in music theory, positive rational numbers (considered as<br/>&gt; frequency ratios) correspond to just intervals, and multiplication of<br/>&gt; rational numbers corresponds to addition of intervals.  So musical<br/>&gt; intervals, and the operation of adding intervals, also form a group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But only if the combination of any two rational intervals is a<br/>&gt; rational interval; and the combination of an upward fifth, say, and a<br/>&gt; downward fifth is a unison.  So the rational intervals form a group<br/>&gt; only if the unison is defined to be an interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not just wordplay; it&apos;s defining terms in such a way as to make<br/>&gt; things like group theory applicable to the problem.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I hardly see what all this has to do with unison, which is a state of<br/>interval-lessness.</p><p>&gt; - Rich Holmes<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@yahoo.com.br&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2006 9:19:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan Yarman escreveu:<br/>&gt; Petr,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What number times 0 can yield a non-zero number anyway?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;What number?

The moment the sun was completely covered on 11 August 1999<br/>according to the Gregorian calendar, and when the totality was visible from<br/>Elazig-Turkey, this marked that day as the zeroth day of the zeroth year of<br/>E.C. After 24 hours have elapsed, we will proceed into day 1 E.C. After 12<br/>months have elapsed, we will proceed into year 1 E.C.

Is it Kelvin degrees, Celcius degrees or Fahrenheit<br/>degrees? If it is Kelvin degrees, 0 denotes the absence of molecular motion<br/>in ideal conditions. If one is talking about Celsius degrees, 0 denotes the<br/>absence of liquid water in ideal conditions.</p><p>However, 0 degrees Fahrenheit is a little problematic:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit</a></p><p>And I think one should throw it out the window altogether, for there is no<br/>clarity as to what 0 degrees Fahrenheit means.</p><p>Still, even as it is now, one could establish 0 degrees Fahrenheit to denote<br/>a state for the absence of some quality or another. So my argument stands.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Your definition of inversion is likewise lacking. An interval can only<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; inverted if the base pitch is flipped over to its octave. Likewise,<br/>chords<br/>&gt; &gt; are inverted in this fashion. Since unison is two same pitches at the<br/>base,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are already assuming to much. Intervals have no inherent direction,<br/>&gt; there is no base. Flip one or the other, the outcome will be the same.<br/>&gt; In order to prevent you form bringing up that &quot;flip&quot; is not defined for<br/>&gt; isolated primes, please think of two melodies in double counterpoint and<br/>&gt; flip one of these over. Watch what happens to primes and octaves.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are talking about an inversion and you think you are at a liberty to<br/>invert and transpose an interval just like that... without establishing a<br/>proper point of reference? My good fellow, tell me please, what are the<br/>inversions of a C major chord? Can you claim that a second inversion of F<br/>major is related to any inversion of C major?</p><p>My German is horrible but here goes:</p><p>&grave;Jaa, u flipz zee pitsch oaf zee baz tonne un octaf haier und schnell!&grave;</p><p>That ought to show you the importance of a base tone for any chord or<br/>interval you may wish to invert.</p><p>Achtung! You are not allowed to say that you don&apos;t need a base tone for<br/>inversion operations. It is this very tone that you transpose an octave<br/>above for inversion to take place.</p><p>How else can chord inversions be realized anyhow?</p><p>And why should unison be an exception to the rule when it is resting on the<br/>base tone for an inversion operation?</p><p>Inverting the unison carries both pitches an octave above. Never mind the<br/>centuries of error committed in the name of scholastic tradition.

Infinitely small does not<br/>&gt; equal 0. You are decreasing in size perpetually, but you never reach zero.<br/>&gt; In contrast, you can increase in size perpetually, and never reach an end.</p><p>I see you&apos;ve not got my idea. OK, so another example.<br/>Take the number 1, add 1/2 to this, and you get 1.5. Add 1/4, and you get<br/>1.75. Add 1/8, and you get 1.875. Add 1/16, and you get 1.9375. ... If you<br/>go on doing this for an infinite number of times, you eventually reach 2. If<br/>you do this for a finite number of times, you&apos;ll never get there.</p><p>&gt; What? Zero is not something too small to be called a value, it is the<br/>&gt; absence of value proper, or rather, the absence of whatever it is you want<br/>&gt; to count.</p><p>Never! This is just the same as if you said that negative numbers are<br/>nonsense (or don&apos;t exist) and trying to proove it stating that you can&apos;t<br/>hold &quot;minus two apples&quot; in your hand or that noone can take two apples away<br/>from you if you don&apos;t have even one of them.</p><p>&gt; According to John Wallis, &quot;Infinitely means more than any Finite number<br/>&gt; assignable&quot;. It is the impossibility of assigning a substantial quantity.</p><p>This proves MY point. Even the number of existing finite numbers is<br/>infinite. That means if you stack finite numbers in whatever way (even some<br/>extremely huge ones), you would have to do this for an infinite number of<br/>times in order to get to infinity.</p><p>&gt; infinity is not the largest value, it is the impossibility of descerning a<br/>&gt; finite value.</p><p>Can you tell me who was the author of this statement? Probably not someone<br/>who has a passion for examining the internal structure of values and their<br/>properties/relations. If this was true, then you could say, for example,<br/>that the number of 100 trillion was infinity some millenia ago (at the times<br/>when even highly aware people were unwilling or unable to accept its large<br/>quantity) and is not anymore as we have already developped skills for<br/>describing and using numbers this large. But this is not the case. The<br/>calculators which call a large number &quot;infinity&quot; are calling it like that<br/>not for any &quot;infinityness&quot; but for its value which is too large for them to<br/>accept. If there was a calculator which could work with numbers as large as<br/>there exist in the world, infinity would never appear as a result because<br/>calculators are not designed for operating with infinity.</p><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; That means zero times infinity<br/>&gt; &gt; is actually an uncertain value denoting the range between these two<br/>rather<br/>&gt; &gt; than a single position in that range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is not only uncertain, but also indeterminable.</p><p>That&apos;s what I meant. It&apos;s indeterminable to be given a single position in<br/>the range between 0 and infinity, but it&apos;s the range. Maybe this example<br/>will help you understand better what I mean. Everyone knows that &quot;X^0 = 1&quot;<br/>whatever value you assign to X. Taking this result from the other end, I can<br/>actually say that the 0th root of 1 can result in any number existing. Do<br/>you want to tell me its impossible to describe the result of the 0th root of<br/>1, or, for that matter, the 0th root of any number?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2006 3:36:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; What?

However,<br/>I will staunchly defend my point of view until I&apos;m proven wrong.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You can define both infinetesimal and infinitely large in mathematics as<br/>&gt; &gt; long as you remain faithful to the terminology. Infinitely small does<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; equal 0. You are decreasing in size perpetually, but you never reach<br/>zero.<br/>&gt; &gt; In contrast, you can increase in size perpetually, and never reach an<br/>end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see you&apos;ve not got my idea. OK, so another example.<br/>&gt; Take the number 1, add 1/2 to this, and you get 1.5. Add 1/4, and you get<br/>&gt; 1.75. Add 1/8, and you get 1.875. Add 1/16, and you get 1.9375. ... If you<br/>&gt; go on doing this for an infinite number of times, you eventually reach 2.<br/>If<br/>&gt; you do this for a finite number of times, you&apos;ll never get there.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I do not think at all that you will ever reach 2, you will simply get closer<br/>and closer to it. The difference will diminish constantly, but never vanish<br/>altogether.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What? Zero is not something too small to be called a value, it is the<br/>&gt; &gt; absence of value proper, or rather, the absence of whatever it is you<br/>want<br/>&gt; &gt; to count.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Never! This is just the same as if you said that negative numbers are<br/>&gt; nonsense (or don&apos;t exist) and trying to proove it stating that you can&apos;t<br/>&gt; hold &quot;minus two apples&quot; in your hand or that noone can take two apples<br/>away<br/>&gt; from you if you don&apos;t have even one of them.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If I owe you 5 dollars and I have no money in my possession to pay you, my<br/>assets are -5 dollars. Never did I claim anywhere that negative numbers do<br/>not exist. I see that you appreciate neither zero nor negativity in their<br/>proper context in the integer continuum.</p><p>&gt; &gt; According to John Wallis, &quot;Infinitely means more than any Finite number<br/>&gt; &gt; assignable&quot;. It is the impossibility of assigning a substantial<br/>quantity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This proves MY point. Even the number of existing finite numbers is<br/>&gt; infinite. That means if you stack finite numbers in whatever way (even<br/>some<br/>&gt; extremely huge ones), you would have to do this for an infinite number of<br/>&gt; times in order to get to infinity.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The number of existing finite numbers are not infinite. You cannot reach<br/>infinity by stacking finite numbers, unless you do this indefinitely, and<br/>this does not render finite numbers the status of infinity. You will only<br/>reach insurmountable numbers by doing so a definite number of times.<br/>Infinity is an endlessly indefinite process in either the positive, or the<br/>negative direction.</p><p>&gt; &gt; infinity is not the largest value, it is the impossibility of descerning<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; finite value.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you tell me who was the author of this statement? Probably not someone<br/>&gt; who has a passion for examining the internal structure of values and their<br/>&gt; properties/relations.</p><p>I am the author of that statement in all my ignorance and daring.</p><p>If this was true, then you could say, for example,<br/>&gt; that the number of 100 trillion was infinity some millenia ago (at the<br/>times<br/>&gt; when even highly aware people were unwilling or unable to accept its large<br/>&gt; quantity)</p><p>What do people who lived thousands of years ago have anything to do with the<br/>mathematical concept of infinity? I&apos;m referring to the impossibility not<br/>depending on the limitations of the human mind, but the actual workings of<br/>the cosmos.</p><p>and is not anymore as we have already developped skills for<br/>&gt; describing and using numbers this large. But this is not the case. The<br/>&gt; calculators which call a large number &quot;infinity&quot; are calling it like that<br/>&gt; not for any &quot;infinityness&quot; but for its value which is too large for them<br/>to<br/>&gt; accept.</p><p>Take for instance Pi. If it is a trancendental number as it is said to be,<br/>then we can safely claim that the integers after the dot will go on<br/>indefinitely without reaching an end. Thus we can say that Pi is infinitely<br/>complex, meaning that you cannot exhaust the numerical detail of Pi. If it<br/>was possible to exhaust decimal places, you cannot say any longer that the<br/>chain of numbers is infinitely long.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi</a></p><p>Forgive me for saying so, but I do not think you grasp infinity at all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It is not only uncertain, but also indeterminable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I meant. It&apos;s indeterminable to be given a single position in<br/>&gt; the range between 0 and infinity, but it&apos;s the range. Maybe this example<br/>&gt; will help you understand better what I mean. Everyone knows that &quot;X^0 = 1&quot;<br/>&gt; whatever value you assign to X. Taking this result from the other end, I<br/>can<br/>&gt; actually say that the 0th root of 1 can result in any number existing.

That implies using external or at least logical<br/>rules to deal with these<br/>&gt; ideas.  It won&apos;t go anywhere.<br/>&gt; To say that 1.9999 (repeat nines for infinity) = 2 is not right or wrong.<br/>It&apos;s a bunch of<br/>&gt; SYMBOLS.  In other words, we have a notation system for categorizing our<br/>ideas.  And for<br/>&gt; COMMUNICATION&apos;S sake we have to agree whether or not we allow this<br/>equalization of two<br/>&gt; different symbols.  These ideas do not otherwise externally exist.  Any<br/>debate that thinks<br/>&gt; that 2 or 1.99999... is something more tangible than a symbol for<br/>communication is<br/>&gt; kidding themselves.  So quit it.

Thus, it is<br/>redundant to speak of an &grave;interval of a unison&grave; as if such a measurably<br/>quantity seperating tones from each other existed, as long as it is agreed<br/>that an error by musicians sounding a unison is not the fault of the unison.</p><p>In a world not cognizant of zero, the zeroth position has been designated as<br/>the &grave;perfect prime&grave;, and remains hence in our music vocabulary.
