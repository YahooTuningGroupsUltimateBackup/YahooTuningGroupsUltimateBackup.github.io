And in my<br/>daily attempts to escape the harassment of the new neighborhood&apos;s<br/>bullies I&apos;d often avoid the main road to our new house altogether and<br/>opt for what was a long detour through the woods. It was a tough<br/>neighborhood and I adjusted poorly...</p><p>Today&apos;s my birthday and while wandering off into a bit of &apos;man am I<br/>getting old!&apos; introspection, I was struck by how little things have<br/>really changed for me.
