But then it<br/>made me wonder: is the reason for that sort of drift not simply physical<br/>imprecision as we&apos;re apt to assume, but a result of the choir&apos;s natural<br/>tendency to constantly adjust to the appropriate tuning. I spose that would<br/>be hard to measure unless there&apos;s some software that takes into account the<br/>deviations inherent in manyvoices singing in unison, averaging them out, and<br/>coming up with a reasonable pitch average.</p></div>
