Before I just glue and rub together I wonder if anyone has<br/>&gt;experience of this type of craftwork and can offer some tips. The tops<br/>&gt;are best quality and expensive and I don&apos;t want to botch up the job.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ll be stringing the canon with 31 plus steel strings going from<br/>&gt;(roughly) 22s to 14s, bass to treble, so there&apos;s a slight bass to treble<br/>&gt;difference in tension, but not as much as on a guitar. Any advice on<br/>&gt;struts and bracing would be useful.</p><p>Greetings,<br/>    The best glue you could use would be hot hide glue, but it requires a bit<br/>of experience, pre-sizing, and a gluepot.  Perhaps Titebond would be a better<br/>choice.<br/>    Be aware that anytime you glue wood to another piece of wood and the<br/>grains are crossing, there will be a containment factor, ie,  if you glue a<br/>brace under a dry piece of wood, when the moisture rises the board will begin<br/>to arch because wood swell across the grain. So..... you want to know what<br/>moisture content your soundboard has before you glue  a brace across the<br/>grain.  In the piano world,  the board is usually VERY dry when the ribs are<br/>glued and the swelling produces a &quot;belly&quot; in the soundboard that is then<br/>glued into the rim of the piano.<br/>Good luck,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, tN.</p></div>
