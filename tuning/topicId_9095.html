The<br/>sources have usually been pure tones or synthetic complex sounds with<br/>a well-defined spectral composition. In a musical context these<br/>synthetic sounds differ in temporal and spectral properties from the<br/>natural sounds produced by stringed instruments; and it is these<br/>natural sounds which performers are trained to produce and to perceive<br/>in order to make intonation choices. Samples consisting of<br/>approximately 1 s of acoustic sounds produced by a virtuoso violist<br/>playing the notes D4, C5#, A5, and G6 with and without vibrato have<br/>been chosen for this study. The sounds without vibrato were then<br/>resampled to give frequencies from -15 to +21 cents, with respect to<br/>the geometric center of the sound, with vibrato. Experiments with<br/>forced choice for pairs of sounds using musically experienced<br/>listeners (including the violist who produced the original sounds) as<br/>subjects will be reported. These experiments include a control set<br/>consisting of the comparison of pitch levels of these same sounds<br/>played without vibrato. Preliminary results with listeners who are not<br/>string players are in accord with previous results, finding that the<br/>pitch perceived is that of the geometric average.&quot;</p></div>
