That couldn&apos;t hurt, could it?</p><p>I&apos;m no expert on Arab tuning!  I can only relate<br/>what I find in published sources, of which the<br/>classic work by Helmholtz still seems to be the<br/>most thorough exposition readily available to<br/>readers of English.  The following is a summary of<br/>that material, as I understand it, but I welcome<br/>any corrections:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>While it&apos;s true that the mediaeval Arabic lute gamut<br/>was formed from a series of 17 perfect fourths (ref.<br/>Helmholtz trans. Ellis &apos;On the Sensations of Tone&apos;,<br/>p 281), the impression gained and promulgated by<br/>Villoteau was that the Arabs intended to divide the<br/>octave into equal steps of about a third of a tone<br/>(1200/17 = 70.588 cents), or possibly even to divide<br/>equal-tempered tones of 200 cents into exact thirds<br/>of 66.667 cents.  In fact, the gamut of 17 tones per<br/>octave had the following step intervals:</p><p>  L L C L L C L L L C L L C L L L C</p><p>Here L = Pyth. Limma = 256/243 ~= 90 c<br/>and C = Pyth. Comma = 531441/524288 ~= 24 c.</p><p>These are very unequal steps, not at all close to<br/>either kind of third-tone Villoteau envisaged.</p><p>[There is, however, some evidence from Michael<br/>Meshaqah (cited by Eli Smith according to Ellis)<br/>that &quot;modern Greeks&quot; (in the 19th Century) divided<br/>the octave into 4 X 17 = 68 equal parts, forming a<br/>scale with steps:</p><p>12 9 7 12 9 7 12 of these (octave/68) divisions.</p><p>Ellis comments that if the steps of 9 and 7 parts<br/>were instead both of 8 parts, the scale would<br/>consist of:</p><p>3 2 2 3 2 2 3 of these (octave/17) divisions,<br/>&quot;the precise scale of Villoteau&quot; (op. cit. p 556).]</p><p>Each _scale_ (maqam) that the mediaeval Arab<br/>lutists (players on al-&grave;ud) formed from this gamut<br/>contained either seven or eight tones per octave<br/>(tho individual notes might be inflected by way of<br/>ornament, much as modern guitarists bend notes).</p><p>This gamut of 17 tones was clearly tuned by exact<br/>ratios and was a 3-limit system, consisting of a<br/>single chain of pure fourths upwards (or fifths<br/>downwards where necessary to stay in the playing<br/>range of a couple of octaves).  It was not a<br/>meantone system.</p><p>_Modern_ Arabic theory - as given &quot;by the Syrian,<br/>Michael Meshaqah&quot; in 1847 (op. cit p. 264) uses<br/>equal quartertones - an exact 24-fold division of<br/>the octave.

The design of the MIDI Controller (&quot;jammer&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt; seems capable of doing what they claim, with respect<br/>&gt; &gt; to:<br/>&gt; &gt; a) retunings to any 12-tone meantone and up to<br/>&gt; &gt; 19-EDO;<br/>&gt; &gt; b) preserving the same fingering for all such tunings;<br/>&gt; &gt; c) allowing easy transposion, preserving fingering<br/>&gt; &gt; patterns;<br/>&gt; &gt; d) playing a wider span of notes from the same<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic series (up to 3 octaves per hand);<br/>&gt; &gt; e) providing two thumb controllers for continuous<br/>&gt; &gt; signals, requiring interpretation by the attached<br/>&gt; &gt; computer, for realisation as pitch bend, modulation<br/>&gt; &gt; depth, volume, retuning or whatever;<br/>&gt; &gt; f) playing two notes a fifth apart simultaneously<br/>&gt; &gt; with each finger.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These interest me, as well as support for polyphonic aftertouch, which<br/>&gt; is very rare on MIDI keyboards.</p><p>Not to mention expensive!  Yes, that will be<br/>a selling point for musos who want to control<br/>the expression of their playing (me too).</p><p>&gt; &gt; 5.  There is no onboard retuning - that must be done<br/>&gt; &gt; by software on a computer the jammer plugs into.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought the video claimed that this could be done?  I only watched<br/>&gt; the vid once, though.</p><p>You can waggle the thumb controls to change<br/>the tuning - but only if you&apos;ve set up the<br/>software that way.  I should have been more<br/>precise, and said &quot;You can&apos;t switch from one<br/>tuning to another by pressing a button, nor<br/>can you set up the tuning you want to play in,<br/>without using software.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; 6.  They provide no details of how this connects to<br/>&gt; &gt; other equipment.  It requires a minimum of MIDI Out<br/>&gt; &gt; to function as a MIDI controller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought I saw USB mentioned elsewhere on the website.  Apparently,<br/>&gt; the Jammer is designed primarily as a softsynth controller (hence no<br/>&gt; built in synth), via USB. ...</p><p>You&apos;re right; my bad.  Jim pointed out the USB<br/>to me; I must have missed it.  And of course the<br/>USB is bidirectional and uses a smaller &amp; cheaper<br/>connector than the pair of DIN plugs &amp; sockets<br/>required by older MIDI implementations.</p><p>&gt; ...  They also plan to support OSC (Open Sound<br/>&gt; Control), a network-based protocol that allows far more resolution and<br/>&gt; bandwidth than MIDI which is supported in a few commercial products<br/>&gt; such as Max/MSP, Reaktor, and Bidule.</p><p>Yes, that is interesting.  Jim&apos;s also talking of<br/>making the controller software (&quot;Thummer<br/>Setup&quot;) open source.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m definitely interested in the Jammer as a potential entry-level<br/>&gt; generalized-layout controller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paolo</p><p>Ditto.

The following is a summary of<br/>&gt; that material, as I understand it, but I welcome<br/>&gt; any corrections:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; While it&apos;s true that the mediaeval Arabic lute gamut<br/>&gt; was formed from a series of 17 perfect fourths (ref.<br/>&gt; Helmholtz trans. Ellis &apos;On the Sensations of Tone&apos;,<br/>&gt; p 281),</p><p>If the reference here is to Safi Al-Din&apos;s theory of 17 Pythagorean ratios<br/>per octave preserved by Meragi himself, then this definition is wrong. 17<br/>pure fourths from a reference tone gives all the correct pitches except<br/>81/64. Actually, one needs 4 pure fifths up, 12 fifths down.</p><p>Besides, Baghdad was a cosmopolitan centre, hardly making it Arabic during<br/>the conquest by Mongols. The following Levantine treatises are written<br/>during the Ottoman Era, making them more Turkish than Arabic.</p><p>the impression gained and promulgated by<br/>&gt; Villoteau was that the Arabs intended to divide the<br/>&gt; octave into equal steps of about a third of a tone<br/>&gt; (1200/17 = 70.588 cents), or possibly even to divide<br/>&gt; equal-tempered tones of 200 cents into exact thirds<br/>&gt; of 66.667 cents.</p><p>That impression could only be justied during the time of Kantemir, with<br/>possible 1/3rd tones here and there.</p><p>In fact, the gamut of 17 tones per<br/>&gt; octave had the following step intervals:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   L L C L L C L L L C L L C L L L C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here L = Pyth. Limma = 256/243 ~= 90 c<br/>&gt; and C = Pyth.

But there&apos;s a long time between<br/>&gt; 1847 and 1899 - time enough for a scholar to make<br/>&gt; many a revision of his theories.  Assuming that &quot;the<br/>&gt; Syrian, Michael Mesha-qah&quot; of 1847 is the same<br/>&gt; person as the &quot;Lebanese scholar Mih.a&apos;il Mu^saqah&quot;<br/>&gt; of 1899.  Only the vagaries of transliteration<br/>&gt; throws it into doubt, really.  (Lebanon used to be<br/>&gt; part of Syria.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps he learnt more as he got older?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I wonder if that is so.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, the three-quartertone interval was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; introduced by the lutist Zalzal some 1100 years ago.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It was the ratio 12/11 = 151 cents (op. cit. p.264).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This note disappeared from the lutist&apos;s gamut in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mediaeval times.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It did not dissapear, but was dismissed by theory alone. An excessive<br/>zeal<br/>&gt; &gt; and reverence for Pythagoras may be the culprit for this trend. Notice<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; introduction of octave equivalance by Safi Al-Din.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When did this happen?  Can you tell me more<br/>&gt; about this Safi-ud-Din?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>This occured during the 13th century, just before the Mongol invasion. The<br/>Abbasid Empire was in tethers, the caliph merely a puppet of the lords of<br/>the land.

But there&apos;s a long time between<br/>&gt; &gt; 1847 and 1899 - time enough for a scholar to make<br/>&gt; &gt; many a revision of his theories.  Assuming that &quot;the<br/>&gt; &gt; Syrian, Michael Mesha-qah&quot; of 1847 is the same<br/>&gt; &gt; person as the &quot;Lebanese scholar Mih.a&apos;il Mu^saqah&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; of 1899.  Only the vagaries of transliteration<br/>&gt; &gt; throws it into doubt, really.  (Lebanon used to be<br/>&gt; &gt; part of Syria.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps he learnt more as he got older?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder if that is so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, the three-quartertone interval was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduced by the lutist Zalzal some 1100 years ago.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was the ratio 12/11 = 151 cents (op. cit. p.264).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This note disappeared from the lutist&apos;s gamut in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mediaeval times.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It did not dissapear, but was dismissed by theory alone. An excessive<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; zeal and reverence for Pythagoras may be the culprit for this trend.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Notice the introduction of octave equivalance by Safi Al-Din.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When did this happen?  Can you tell me more<br/>&gt; &gt; about this Safi-ud-Din?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This occured during the 13th century, just before the Mongol invasion. The<br/>&gt; Abbasid Empire was in tethers, the caliph merely a puppet of the lords of<br/>&gt; the land.

Of course, if you want *exactly* 88 cents for your octacot<br/>&gt; generator, you can use 11 steps of 150-et instead, which is a<br/>&gt; reasonable choice.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, the scale mentioned (mode 12 9 7 12 9 7 12 of 68-edo) was this:</p><p>  0:          1/1               C          unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        211.765 cents   D<br/>  2:        370.588 cents   D#7  E[<br/>  3:        494.118 cents   F<br/>  4:        705.882 cents   G<br/>  5:        864.706 cents   G#7  A[<br/>  6:        988.235 cents   A//  Bb<br/>  7:          2/1                C          octave</p><p>The ratios desired could be:</p><p>1<br/>9/8<br/>21/17<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>28/17<br/>16/9<br/>2</p><p>&gt; &gt; I dare say, it is a compelling scale with a distinct Maqam flavor.
