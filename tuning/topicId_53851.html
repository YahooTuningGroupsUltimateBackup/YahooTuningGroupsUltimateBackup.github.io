Oh wait, you could just listen to<br/>&gt;the piece in question!</p><p>Is this what you&apos;re talking about?</p><p>&quot;I had discovered some chord progressions in 12 notes in the<br/>process of looking at some of the other equal tunings, which,<br/>oddly enough, were never exploited or used by composers between<br/>1904 and 1915 when they would have been idiomatic. And I<br/>thought, well, to write an etude to explore these, obviously,<br/>you don&apos;t need electronic media. You can just write it for piano.<br/>So I wrote a piano piece in that idiom and the piece came out<br/>sounding slightly like Scriabin with a little Milhaud perhaps<br/>thrown in. Then it occurred to me, &apos;Wait a moment. I can&apos;t make<br/>do with just one etude. I need a set.&apos; So I wrote some more<br/>etudes in tonal idiom that sound rather like Russian music<br/>in 1905.&apos;&quot;</p><p>It isn&apos;t clear what pieces these are.  Piano etudes?  I&apos;ve<br/>heard them more than once, but I didn&apos;t notice any particular<br/>progressions in them.  Note he does not say &apos;completely new&apos;,<br/>but rather &apos;missing from the period in which they would have<br/>been natural&apos;.</p><p>From this interview, I notice that Blackwood agrees 12 is<br/>played out, but places the critical date not in the 20&apos;s, but<br/>in the 60&apos;s...</p><p>&quot;At this point, I am persuaded that the tonal and harmonic<br/>resources of the 12 note equal scale have, in fact, been<br/>discovered and exploited. And I think that&apos;s something that<br/>only came true in about 1965 or 1970. After that, it&apos;s been<br/>some kind of a rehash of what&apos;s been done before. So the last<br/>frontier to be breached is the atonal polyrhythmic idiom,<br/>and there&apos;s a vast repertoire in that idiom that begins<br/>somewhere around 1948, just to pick a random year...&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=53873 href="#53873">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2004 6:39:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Some comments on the first part of The Gift of the Gods...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/cm_main.html">http://www.corporeal.com/cm_main.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know Jon&apos;s particular feelings on this, but<br/>&gt; &gt; usually it&apos;s best to link out as far as possible, IOW<br/>&gt; &gt; to <a href="http://corporeal.com/">corporeal.com/</a> rather than to the cm_main.html page.</p><p>Done.

The nominals would form a Moment of Symmetry (MOS)<br/>or Distributionally Even (DE) scale in that temperament, having a<br/>cardinality (number of notes) that was preferably between about 5<br/>and 10. An example is Graham Breeds decimal notation for the Miracle<br/>temperament.</p><p>In the cases where the generator is a fifth, or equivalently a<br/>fourth (it&apos;s conventional to use the smallest of the equivalent<br/>generators) this is easy. We simply use the standard 7 nominals in<br/>the chain B E A D G C F.

Firstly, to &gt; remove the asymmetry I put D (not C) at the vertical edges of the &gt; diagram and ensured that any lines drawn were reflected about the &gt; vertical centerline (halfway between G and A). I&apos;ve mentioned some of my notation systems (or rather, note-labeling systems, since I don&apos;t know how to notate them on paper but I use them to label the keys on the keyboard and the notes of the Cakewalk piano roll) that are based on the generators of a linear temperament, like the &quot;superpelog&quot; notation (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/superpelog.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/superpelog.html</a>)</p><p>generators       0  5 10  1  6 11  2  7 12  3  8 13  4  9  0<br/>note name        A  F  K  B  G  L  C  H  M  D  I  N  E  J  A<br/>degree of 23-ET  0  2  4  5  7  9 10 12 14 15 17 19 20 22 23</p><p>This can easily be extended by adding more letters, but runs into trouble with fractional-octave temperaments (like lemba!).</p><p>So another idea I&apos;ve been trying to work out is a system of &quot;symmetrical alphabetic&quot; notation: label the notes of an MOS scale in alphabetical order. This means that you&apos;d never have a scale where F comes before E (as in Erv Wilson&apos;s system). The middle note in the sequence (D in the case of a 7-note MOS) is set to the center of symmetry of the MOS, if it has an odd number of notes, or the middle two notes if it has an even number of notes. If there&apos;s more than one period in the octave, just continue in alphabetical order for the rest of the notes in the octave. So taking lemba temperament as an example:</p><p>0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0 (generators)<br/>A  Ax B B# C  CxDb D#Dx E  ExF  Fx G G# AbA (26-ET notation)<br/>   (Bbb)(Cbb)        (Ebb) (Fb) (Gbb)</p><p>Lemba has a 5-note half-octave MOS (A Ax B# C Db / Dx E F Fx G#). It&apos;s symmetrical around Db or G#, so this becomes the center of the 5-note scale, which is repeated with the next five letters of the alphabet in the next half octave.</p><p>        A  B    C    D  E    F  G    H    I  J<br/>0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3<br/>A  Ax B B# C  CxDb D#Dx E  ExF  Fx G G# AbA  Ax</p><p>Then accidentals are added to fill in the remaining notes.</p><p>      AbA  B  CbC  DbD  E  FbF  G  HbH  IbI  J<br/>0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3<br/>A  Ax B B# C  CxDb D#Dx E  ExF  Fx G G# AbA  Ax</p><p>Actually, any of these notes could have been identified with C, since it&apos;s arbitrary how many generators above and below the center you can use, and what pitch the central note is tuned to. Here&apos;s an alternative.</p><p>   A  B B# C  DbD  E E# F  G G# H  IbI  J J#<br/>0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3<br/>A  Ax B B# C  CxDb D#Dx E  ExF  Fx G G# AbA  Ax</p><p>You&apos;ll run into trouble if the tuning you&apos;re using can&apos;t be approximated by an MOS/DE scale with 26 notes per octave or less, but I don&apos;t think there are many practical scales like that. JI can be notated with the standard diatonic scale and accidentals for the commas, if miracle notation is inadequate for a particular use. For ennealimmal, just notate the 9 periods per octave and use accidentals for the generators.</p><p>There are also some cases where the scale is too symmetrical to apply the standard labeling: take the octatonic scale for instance. Do you label starting with A-B as a semitone or a whole tone? To resolve this case, choose the labeling that maximizes the distance between successive copies of the MOS:</p><p>C C#  EbE   F#G   A Bb  C (12-ET notation)<br/>A B   C D   E F   G H   A (Symmetrical alphabetic notation)</p><p>For a generic &quot;standard&quot;, I&apos;ve considered setting the central pitch to one of the following: A=440, C=256, or D=290. But I don&apos;t have any particular preference for one over any of the others.</p><p>&gt; Secondly, while I agree with Erv that &quot;If we are going to adapt &gt; existing notation to new systems, obviously _something_ is going to &gt; have to give.&quot; And I also agree that we should &quot;allow the melodic &gt; values to vary.&quot; However I think it is going too far to allow them &gt; to vary so much that &quot;sometimes ...

The game is played by<br/>plotting, for every generator-size, the pitches of the nominals you<br/>want in that temperament.

ETs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,<br/>7, 8, 9 and maybe 10. Note that some of these appear at more than<br/>one place on the diagram. e.g. 5-ET appears for generator sizes of<br/>1/5 and 2/5 octave. For octave period we only need to look at gens<br/>ranging from 0 to 1/2 octave.</p><p>Then I play join the dots to show how the pitches of these nominals<br/>vary smoothly with changing generator size.</p><p>Then I look at where the best LTs are and see if their nominals so<br/>far form a Rothenberg-proper set, i.e. if their large gaps are no<br/>more than twice as wide as their small gaps. If not then I look at<br/>the nearby ETs with 10 to 16 notes to see how to add more nominals<br/>in order to give the LT a proper set. In some cases we may prefer to<br/>retain a slightly improper set of nominals rather than use more<br/>nominals. That&apos;s what conventional notation does with Pythagorean.</p><p>For half-octave period our vertical axis only needs to go from 0 to<br/>1/4 octave and odd numbered ETs won&apos;t appear on it at all. It will<br/>have a vertical centerline and the right half will be identical to<br/>the left half.</p><p>Drawing one of these diagrams is very educational.

Hemiennealimmal is one of the very few with more than 16 periods in the octave (18 in that case). If someone really likes it enough to want to use it, 72-ET notation for the 18 periods is an option.

Since 72 is too many<br/>then 31 seems a good choice. To avoid, for now, the problem of what<br/>symbols to use for these, we can temporarily use pairs of ASCII<br/>characters where we put a pseudo-accidental _before_ a letter A thru<br/>G.

Majic/whatever<br/>&gt; (major thirds) is near the middle of the third range.<br/>&gt; &gt; For twin chain LTs I think the danger zones are just<br/>&gt; 0 to 1/11 oct, 0 to 109 c<br/>&gt; 3/13 to 1/4 oct, 277 to 300 c<br/>&gt; &gt; For triple and quadruple chains it&apos;s just<br/>&gt; 0 to 1/11 oct, 0 to 109 c<br/>&gt; &gt; and after that the problem goes away since one nominal per chain is<br/>&gt; acceptable when we have 5 or more chains.<br/>&gt; &gt; So, what good LTs fall in these ranges?</p><p>Here&apos;s a sample:</p><p>&quot;Valentine&quot; g = 77.83315314, p = 1199.792743<br/>[&lt;1, 1, 2, 3|, &lt;0, 9, 5, -3|]</p><p>&quot;Nautilus&quot; g = 82.97467050, p = 1202.659696<br/>[&lt;1, 2, 3, 3|, &lt;0, -6, -10, -3|]</p><p>&quot;Myna&quot; g = 309.8926610, p = 1198.828458<br/>[&lt;1, -1, 0, 1|, &lt;0, 10, 9, 7|]</p><p>&quot;Hanson&quot; g = 316.9063960, p = 1200.536355<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 1, -3|, &lt;0, 6, 5, 22|]</p><p>&quot;Kleismic&quot; g = 317.8344609, p = 1203.187309<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 1, 2|, &lt;0, 6, 5, 3|]</p><p>&quot;Muggles&quot; g = 379.3931044, p = 1203.148011<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 2, 5|, &lt;0, 5, 1, -7|]</p><p>&quot;Magic&quot; g = 380.7957184, p = 1201.276744<br/>[&lt;1, 0, 2, -1|, &lt;0, 5, 1, 12|]</p><p>&quot;Squares&quot; g = 426.4581630, p = 1201.698520<br/>[&lt;1, 3, 8, 6|, &lt;0, -4, -16, -9|]</p><p>&quot;Shrutar&quot; g = 52.64203308, p = 599.4604367<br/>[&lt;2, 3, 5, 5|, &lt;0, 2, -4, 7|]</p><p>&quot;Injera&quot; g = 93.60982493, p = 600.8889070<br/>[&lt;2, 3, 4, 5|, &lt;0, 1, 4, 4|]</p><p>&quot;Tripletone&quot; g = 92.45965769, p = 399.0200131<br/>[&lt;3, 5, 7, 8|, &lt;0, -1, 0, 2|]</p><p>&quot;Augmented&quot; g = 107.3111730, p = 399.9922103<br/>[&lt;3, 5, 7, 9|, &lt;0, -1, 0, -2|]</p></div><h3><a id=54129 href="#54129">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2004 10:27:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt; Yes.

You need at least one accidental pair to go from an MOS to a linear temperament.  I think the nominals do work best as an MOS in this case, for the reasons Paul gave.  If the nominals aren&apos;t an MOS, that first accidental pair will generally only give you an equal temperament, or something similar like an MOS.  So you start counting from there.</p><p>Once you have a regular temperament, each new accidental pair can increase the codimension.  But it can also be useful to have redundant accidentals, like the comma-shift between Db and C# in Pythagorean.</p><p>What I&apos;m suggesting with hybrid notations is that a notation designed for a linear temperament instead gets used for a fixed MOS.  This MOS functions like the set of nominals, but is too large to give each note its own symbol or staff position.  With mystery, you could really get a planar temperament from the notation because the &quot;MOS&quot; is really 29-equal, and so can be replaced with the MOS you appear to describe. With magic, it would mean a different tuning.  The first accidental pair would have to describe some other 19 note MOS than the magic one, most obviously meantone.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=54140 href="#54140">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2004 2:42:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure which &quot;basic idea&quot; is being referred to here, but &gt; certainly these are all notated by comma inflections from 7 nominals &gt; in a chain of the temperament&apos;s best fifths.</p><p>The problem is, you can&apos;t get 7 notes from magic&apos;s best fifths within the 19-note MOS.  So some of those nominals will have only theoretical existence, or you have to use a Tenney-style system where the nominals are a 5-limit diatonic.</p><p>What I worked out is essentially a 225:224-planar notation with 19-equal enharmonies.

The enharmonic equivalences amount to a tempering out of 3125:3072 in the 5-limit plane.</p><p>The trouble is, for the 19 or 22 note MOS, you need 6 lattice rows. This would lead to at least 3 compound comma shifts for HEWM.  So what I&apos;ve done is take the theoretical nominals to be fifth generated, but fudge the sharps and flats so that, for example, A-C#-E is a 5-limit triad (I think this is originally one of Fokker&apos;s ideas).  This way, all 22 notes can be described with only single sharps and flats and no more than two compound comma shifts (and you only *need* a double comma shift on one note anyway).  The 19 note MOS can be notated such that each note is unique if you ignore the comma shifts.  Anything in this MOS that&apos;s written as a major third really is the best approximation to 5:4, although the same isn&apos;t true of fifths (but the comma shifts make this clear).</p><p>The idea is that where the notation looks familiar, it can be played assuming meantone or JI without doing much damage.  Where a 3125:3072 bridge is crossed, the notation should look weird enough to remind the performer what temperament is actually being used.  The only problem is that the sharp and flat symbols don&apos;t mean what a performer trained in a Pythagorean-based notation will think they should mean.  Am I right in assuming that sagittal will solve this problem?  That is, that it supplies convenient symbols for both the usual Pythagorean sharps and flats and these alternative, 5-limit based ones?  More generally, all we need is a good way of notating 5-limit JI based on 7 nominals and covering 6 lattice rows.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=54141 href="#54141">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2004 3:33:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not sure which &quot;basic idea&quot; is being referred to here, but<br/>&gt; &gt; certainly these are all notated by comma inflections from 7<br/>&gt; nominals<br/>&gt; &gt; in a chain of the temperament&apos;s best fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By which you mean one 12-equal subset is notated conventionally,<br/>&gt; without any comma inflections, right?</p><p>Yes.

A periodicity<br/>block/strip/whatever<br/>&gt; &gt;tiles with itself, without gaps or overlaps, to cover the entire<br/>&gt; &gt;lattice.

Glad we agree! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;If your nominals don&apos;t form a periodic unit, then there will<br/>either<br/>&gt; &gt;be gaps or overlaps. Gaps, where no nominal is really appropriate,<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt;overlaps, where more than one might be. The former case seems<br/>pretty<br/>&gt; &gt;fatal for notation. The latter seems to be a clear case that at<br/>least<br/>&gt; &gt;one of the nominals (like the German B or H) is best jettisoned<br/>&gt; &gt;(either use Hb for B or use B# for H).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As we know from the hypothesis, MOS/DE/whatever correspond to linear<br/>&gt; temperaments, which only require one accidental pair.</p><p>You&apos;re forgetting the hypothesis again.

Magic would be a good candidate, since it&apos;s a good 5-limit approximation that&apos;s otherwise tricky to notate. Since we need to represent half-octave temperaments, we&apos;d need to use magic[16] or magic[22]. 22 is especially attractive, since 16 only works with the 5-limit version of magic, and if we notate 22-ET we can treat it as magic, pajara, or porcupine, whichever works out best for a particular temperament. If you extend my porcupine notation by adding successive letters of the alphabet for every third step of 22-ET:</p><p>|          1         2 2<br/>|0....5....0....5....0.2<br/>|A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H<br/>|  I  J  K  L  M  N  O<br/>| P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  A</p><p>you can use these letters to fill a magic-porcupine block:</p><p>+---------------+<br/>|     /Q\__     |<br/>|    /V S P\_   |<br/>|   /E B U R(O) |<br/>|  /J G D A T/  |<br/>| (O)L I F C/   |<br/>|    \N_K H/    |<br/>|       \M/     |<br/>+---------------+</p><p>and tile it to fill the 5-limit lattice space.</p><p>+-------------------------+<br/>|R(O)L I F C/V S P\M/J G D|<br/>| T/Q\N_K H/E B U R(O)L I |<br/>|C/V S P\M/J G D A T/Q\N_K|<br/>| E B U R(O)L I F C/V S P\|<br/>|J G D A T/Q\N_K H/E B U R|<br/>|)L I F C/V S P\M/J G D A |<br/>|Q\N_K H/E B U R(O)L I F C|<br/>| S P\M/J G D A T/Q\N_K H/|<br/>|B U R(O)L I F C/V S P\M/J|<br/>| D A T/Q\N_K H/E B U R(O)|<br/>|I F C/V S P\M/J G D A T/Q|<br/>| K H/E B U R(O)L I F C/V |<br/>|P\M/J G D A T/Q\N_K H/E B|<br/>| R(O)L I F C/V S P\M/J G |<br/>|A T/Q\N_K H/E B U R(O)L I|<br/>+-------------------------+</p><p>For chains of minor thirds, you have up to 11 nominals to pick from: P R T V B D F H J L N. Coincidentally (?), 11 is the size of an MOS of the best-known chain-of-minor-thirds temperament (kleismic). Chains of fourths or major thirds give you the whole 22-nominal range to use as needed. Half-octave temperaments would center one chain on D and the other one on O. Three-per-octave would use D, U, and I; four per octave could start with D and O, and add either B and M, or F and Q.</p><p>Note that intervals like A-C, G-I, K-M, and so on (skipping a letter) are all minor thirds! This useful property is a consequence of using porcupine notation. Fourths are like A-D, H-K, and so on. Major thirds are a little trickier: you have to go back five letters (F-A, H-C, etc). Of course, when you notate temperaments, there will be all those enharmonic equivalents to learn, but it&apos;s good to have a basic set that&apos;s relatively easy to figure out.</p><p>How&apos;s that for a start?</p></div><h3><a id=54170 href="#54170">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2004 9:05:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The second decade of the 20th century is way to early to start<br/>&gt;kvetching about the death of classical music. Camille Saint-Saens<br/>&gt;died in that decade, for gosh sakes, and was composing music right<br/>&gt;up to the end not much different than he did when he was 19 and<br/>&gt;wrote his Symphony #1. Prokoviev died in 1954, Sibelius in 1957,<br/>&gt;Vaughan Williams in 1958 so I suggest at least wait until the 60s.</p><p>Norman Henry&apos;s idea is that hindsight is necessary to inform<br/>judgements of greatness.  There may be some truth to that.<br/>Classical music does seem to be dying, though.  Actually in<br/>the US it&apos;s already dead, perhaps even entering the revival<br/>phase.  This was a cultural thing, though.  Rock music uses<br/>the same tuning as classical music, with the same harmonic<br/>resources, and it took off like thunder.</p><p>As for harmonic resources, I don&apos;t think they run out.  The<br/>things you have to do to differentiate yourself just get more<br/>subtle. The kinds of decisions you make in voicings, for<br/>example -- jazz musicians can often recognize dozens of artists<br/>this way.

I believe Paul &gt; Erlich agreed with me.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that any arbitrary periodicity block would be useful, and I&apos;d agree with the assessment that Ben Johnston&apos;s notation in particular is confusing. But it&apos;s like saying that having the nominals in a linear chain has already been tried, if the only example you have is the diatonic scale. That approach makes a &quot;complete mess&quot; with third-based temperaments, half-octave temperaments, and pretty much anything that isn&apos;t diatonic. Pretty much everything that&apos;s &quot;already been tried&quot; has problems with one temperament or another. I think you should give this one another look.</p><p>You can look at this &quot;magic/porcupine/pajara&quot; notation in more than one way. Above all, it&apos;s a neat way of notating each note of 22-ET, which is one of the smaller good 7-limit ET&apos;s with an exact half-octave. These same 22 nominals can be used to name degrees of Orwell[31], Pajara[34], Porcupine[37], or Magic[41]. You could go to 26-ET and use the whole alphabet, but there aren&apos;t as many good temperaments with 26-ET compared with 22-ET. Or you could stick with 12-ET and just add a few extra names for the black notes, but a few odd temperaments still need more than 12 nominals to notate.</p><p>Take mavila as an example of how this notation is intended to work: if you round to the nearest 22-ET degree, you get 15-3-12-0-10-19-7 (I E H D V C U). The thirds D-U, E-V, H-C and I-D are notated consistently with major thirds as in porcupine or magic.

But it&apos;s like saying that having the nominals in a<br/>linear<br/>&gt; chain has already been tried, if the only example you have is the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale. That approach makes a &quot;complete mess&quot; with third-<br/>based<br/>&gt; temperaments, half-octave temperaments, and pretty much anything<br/>that<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t diatonic.<br/>&gt; Pretty much everything that&apos;s &quot;already been tried&quot; has<br/>&gt; problems with one temperament or another. I think you should give<br/>this<br/>&gt; one another look.</p><p>OK. But I&apos;m pretty sure I can see with Johnston notation that it&apos;s<br/>fundamentally the 2-dimensionality of the nominal set that causes<br/>the problems.</p><p>&gt; You can look at this &quot;magic/porcupine/pajara&quot; notation in more<br/>than one<br/>&gt; way. Above all, it&apos;s a neat way of notating each note of 22-ET,<br/>which is<br/>&gt; one of the smaller good 7-limit ET&apos;s with an exact half-octave.<br/>These<br/>&gt; same 22 nominals can be used to name degrees of Orwell[31], Pajara<br/>[34],<br/>&gt; Porcupine[37], or Magic[41]. You could go to 26-ET and use the<br/>whole<br/>&gt; alphabet, but there aren&apos;t as many good temperaments with 26-ET<br/>compared<br/>&gt; with 22-ET. Or you could stick with 12-ET and just add a few extra<br/>names<br/>&gt; for the black notes, but a few odd temperaments still need more<br/>than 12<br/>&gt; nominals to notate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take mavila as an example of how this notation is intended to<br/>work: if<br/>&gt; you round to the nearest 22-ET degree, you get 15-3-12-0-10-19-7<br/>(I E H<br/>&gt; D V C U). The thirds D-U, E-V, H-C and I-D are notated<br/>consistently with<br/>&gt; major thirds as in porcupine or magic. In pitch order this is H I<br/>C D E<br/>&gt; U V: the difference between the steps I-C and E-U compared with<br/>the<br/>&gt; other steps is clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D  S  L  E  T  M  F  U  N  G  V  O  H  A  P  I  B  Q  J  C  R  K  D<br/>&gt; 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22<br/>&gt; D        E           U        V     H        I           C        D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, this isn&apos;t a perfect system (23-ET notation is clearly better<br/>for<br/>&gt; mavila), but it still seems pretty good. The one deficiency is<br/>that the<br/>&gt; step V-H appears to be different from the other small steps, and<br/>&gt; consequently the minor thirds U-H and V-I are notated<br/>inconsistently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This system even turns out to be acceptable for &quot;gawel&quot;, the<br/>cumbersome<br/>&gt; temperament with the approx. 569-cent generator, when mapped to<br/>steps of<br/>&gt; magic[41]:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; D  S  L  E  T  M  F  U  N  G  V  O  H  A  P  I  B  Q  J  C  R  K  D<br/>&gt; 0  2  4  6  7  9 11 13 15 17 19    22 24 26 28 30 32 34 35 37 39 41<br/>&gt;                                                  B<br/>&gt;                 M                             I<br/>&gt;              T                             P<br/>&gt;        L                                A<br/>&gt;     S                                H<br/>D<br/>&gt; D                             V                                K<br/>&gt;                             G                                R<br/>&gt;                          N                             J<br/>&gt;                       U                             Q<br/>&gt;                    F<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you can see, the match isn&apos;t perfect, but it&apos;s still pretty<br/>good for<br/>&gt; a generic all-purpose LT notation system.</p><p>If we forget about whether this is a PB or not, then I totally agree<br/>that this is the right way to go about using the rest of the Roman<br/>alphabet as nominal (if you must use the rest of the Roman alphabet).</p><p>i.e. I agree with &quot;O&quot; as the half-octave, since it&apos;s like zero. I<br/>have misgivings about using &quot;H&quot; at all due to the German usage, but<br/>what the heck, we&apos;re never going to use &quot;B&quot; to mean what we usually<br/>call &quot;Bb&quot; so we might as well do what we like with &quot;H&quot;, and we won&apos;t<br/>get &quot;O&quot; to fall in the right place unless we do.</p><p>So what I see you as doing is using the 7 letters A to G in pretty<br/>much their usual positions (although tending more towards their 7-ET<br/>positions) and then using the 7 letters H to N for pitches flat of A<br/>to G, and using P to V for pitches sharp of A to G. This may be the<br/>best we can do in ASCII, but otherwise I prefer Greek<br/>transliterations of A to G instead of H to N, and the Hebrew instead<br/>of P to V. It is good not to use X or Y because these are the only<br/>uppercase used in the ASCIIfication of sagittal accidentals.</p></div><h3><a id=54368 href="#54368">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2004 9:19:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t take to the witness stand on this, but I&apos;m willing to bet<br/>&gt; you don&apos;t know a whole lot about the music of today, much less the<br/>&gt; last couple of decades.

And I<br/>&gt; thought, well, to write an etude to explore these, obviously,<br/>&gt; you don&apos;t need electronic media. You can just write it for piano.<br/>&gt; So I wrote a piano piece in that idiom and the piece came out<br/>&gt; sounding slightly like Scriabin with a little Milhaud perhaps<br/>&gt; thrown in. Then it occurred to me, &apos;Wait a moment. I can&apos;t make<br/>&gt; do with just one etude. I need a set.&apos; So I wrote some more<br/>&gt; etudes in tonal idiom that sound rather like Russian music<br/>&gt; in 1905.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Have you got these as MIDI files somewhere?
