It is interactive because I can hit the bells with the back of the file while I am filing (tuning).</p><p>Well that is for your information. Now I would like to know if anybody in this list knows about a tuning machine that I could buy for the same purpose, but that also has some kind of memory (maybe it can take readings to the computer) and it has a bit more precission than a needle but still as interactive as the needle tuners.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Tony Salinas</p><p>___________________________________________________________<br/>Inbox full of unwanted email?
