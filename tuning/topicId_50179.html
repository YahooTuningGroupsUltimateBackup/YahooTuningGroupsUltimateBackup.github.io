[2]<br/>0 4 8 12 1 5 9 13 2 6 10 14 3 7 11 (0... [4]</p><p>[I wish there was an easy way to draw ascii circles]</p><p>Now, choose a segment of the generator that contains as many notes as possible but not, when rearranged, contains groups of three adjacent pitch classes:</p><p>0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14<br/>or<br/>0 4 8 12</p><p>Next study the transposition of this group by the generator:</p><p>0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14  ---&gt;  2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1<br/>0 4 8 12 ---&gt; 4 8 12 1</p><p>As can be seen one pitch is replaced by another, maximally adjacent, above it : 0 goes to 1</p><p>Keep repeating this until a cycle of &apos;keys&apos; is formed.</p><p>Now, write the first key (the one starting with pitch-class 0) on a &apos;stave&apos; such that each ascending note takes a line or a space:</p><p>0 ----------------(o----- This is the &apos;octave&apos; above the lower 0 line.<br/>14               o<br/>12-------------o---------<br/>10           o<br/>8 ---------o-------------<br/>6        o<br/>4 -----o-----------------<br/>2    o<br/>0 -o---------------------</p><p>The same scale beginning on pitch-class 2 contains pitch-class 1, which is notated as</p><p>2                    o<br/>0 ----------------#o----- This is the &apos;octave&apos; above the lower 0 line.<br/>14               o<br/>12-------------o---------<br/>10           o<br/>8 ---------o-------------<br/>6        o<br/>4 -----o-----------------<br/>2    o<br/>0 ----------------------</p><p>Thus you have a sequence of sharps in one direction and (when transposing downwards by the generator, 2) flats.<br/>Obviously, 15EDO behaves like 12EDO in that 0# = 1 = 2b (if you&apos;ll pardon the orthography). This means that letter names can be used<br/>A B C D E F G H, with A=0, say, so that the key of B is B C D E F G H A# B, and the key of Hb is: Hb A B C D E F G H A.<br/>You will notice that the scale steps are as follows:</p><p>A 2 B 2 C 2 D 2 E 2 F 2 G 2 H 1 A.</p><p>For those of you more into scale theory, we could substitute 3 for 2 and 2 for 1 to end up with the 23EDO analogue to 15EDO (like 19EDO is to 12EDO):</p><p>A 3 B 3 C 3 D 3 E 3 F 3 G 3 H 2 A. Which of course would permit &apos;split keys&apos; of a keyboard tuned in 23EDO. The next EDO up would be 38EDO: A 5 B 5 C 5 D 5 E 5 F 5 G 5 H 3 A.</p><p>As for the 0 4 8 12 segment, it is best seen as a subset of the 0 2 4 etc. segment.</p><p>I suppose this little bit of scale theory puts me in the notation per scale camp, rather than having a generalised notation, such as decimal or altered stave notation. I choose to devise a notation for each scale, with #s and bs as I think (IMHO) it leads to a consistent notation.</p><p>Mark</p></div><h3><a id=50748 href="#50748">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2003 4:39:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Mark</p><p>I just wanted to acknowledge Mark for his fine contributions to this<br/>thread and hope that next year, and those beyond, will lead to still<br/>deeper comminglings between his ideas and those of the rest of<br/>us . . .</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
