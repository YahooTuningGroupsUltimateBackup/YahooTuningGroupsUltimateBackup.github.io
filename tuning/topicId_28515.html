I guess what confused me in the<br/>Schulter article... which I found *really* interesting as is obvious<br/>from my posts was the following paragraph:</p><p>Margo Schulter:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_28294.html#28367">/tuning/topicId_28294.html#28367</a></p><p>&quot;Lindley has observed, more specifically, that the treatment of<br/>intermediate cadences and phrasing may suggest that Dufay often<br/>composed with expectations based on some kind of keyboard instrument<br/>(an organ or clavichord) for 12 notes tuned in the Pythagorean Gb-B<br/>arrangement.  He notes that sonorities such as A3-C#4-E4 often have<br/>what he calls a &quot;stable&quot; and I might call a &quot;prolonged noncadential&quot;<br/>role, the sonorities where schisma thirds (e.g. A3-Db4-E4 as realized<br/>on a Gb-B keyboard) would have a smooth, quasi-5-limit, effect.&quot;</p><p>Here it seems that Db and C# are used almost interchangeably...</p><p>Obvious they are different pitches in the Pythagorean system and are<br/>*non* enharmonic equivalents...</p><p>So, I guess it appears that possibly the composers were tuning a<br/>Pythagorean C# to a schmatic Db and using a diminished fourth while<br/>writing it as a third...</p><p>At least that&apos;s the impression I&apos;m getting from this... but I could<br/>just be misunderstanding it.... ??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>________ ________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=28550 href="#28550">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2001 1:10:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, I guess it appears that possibly the composers were tuning a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean C# to a schmatic Db and using a diminished fourth while<br/>&gt; writing it as a third...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least that&apos;s the impression I&apos;m getting from this... but I could<br/>&gt; just be misunderstanding it.... ??</p><p>You&apos;re understanding Lindley&apos;s thesis just fine, Joseph!</p></div>
