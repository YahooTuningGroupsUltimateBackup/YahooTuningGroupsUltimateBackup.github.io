The &quot;tritone&quot; between scale steps 2 to flat 6 in the minor mode<br/>&gt; is used as a functional tritone in the dominant-function diminished seventh<br/>&gt; chord; the 2 resloves up a half step to b3 and the b6 resolves down a half<br/>&gt; step to 5.</p><p>Paul, this isn&apos;t really a disagreement with my post. It is actually<br/>additional information. Insert the word &quot;also&quot; between your &quot;is&quot; and &quot;used&quot;<br/>and it supports my point. The dominant-function diminished seventh chord is<br/>of course TWO tritones, both of which tend to tune as diminished fifths<br/>&quot;leaning toward&quot; their respective destination pitches. One relates to the<br/>tonic/third destination while the other relates to the third/fifth<br/>destination (or relative major key, as I pointed out).</p><p>It seems to me that when scale steps 2 and b6 are used in a subdominant<br/>context the apparent tritone is more a &quot;problem&quot; than a tool. That is likely<br/>why composers of the common practice period consistently inverted the ii<br/>chord to ii6 in order to camouflage any functional-tritone effect. When the<br/>third of the ii chord is placed in the bass, both the b6 and the 2 can more<br/>easily tune directly to to the bass rather than to each other, thus<br/>stabilizing the overall harmonic gravity toward subdominant.</p><p>My point was that these scale steps will tend to tune differently when used<br/>in subdominant and dominant contexts.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Paul H.

If they form a<br/>1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 half-diminished seventh chord, they&apos;re still 5:7, and if<br/>they form a 5:6:7:9 half-diminished seventh chord, they&apos;re still 5:7. But<br/>the overall pitch might be different. Is that whay you meant? Or the<br/>first-inversion half-diminished seventh might in fact be 10:12:15:17, giving<br/>17:24 for this interval</p><p>Gerald, at this point you clearly need a synth or something to answer these<br/>questions.

(A somewhat shaky basis for objective<br/>scientific research, I admit) Let me state it this way. When 2 and b6 appear<br/>in a subdominant chord there is no &quot;need&quot; to create a gravity seeking<br/>tritone, and in fact that can be problemmatic (thus the need to invert, as<br/>mentioned in my previous post). Since the functional root is now scale step<br/>four, the tuning may well change (I&apos;m not sure) but my impression of tuning<br/>allegiance does change--thus minimizing the &quot;tritone effect.&quot; Perhaps the<br/>&quot;high third&quot; influence comes into play, thus exaggerating the tritone<br/>effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gerald, at this point you clearly need a synth or something to answer these<br/>&gt; questions.

Your response to<br/>this one, however, was helpful to me (and, hopefully, to others).</p><p>I am working on getting some means to objectify my contributions. As I am<br/>fairly new to the finer points of acoustic conversations, it may not happen<br/>immediately. I hope, however, in the interim, that my experienced<br/>&quot;subjective&quot; impressions are somewhat helpful to some on the list.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
