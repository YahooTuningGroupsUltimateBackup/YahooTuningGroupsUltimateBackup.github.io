He was having a<br/>&gt; little trouble with it, and sort of gestured at me, what do I do.  I said<br/>&gt; &quot;It&apos;s kind of like 94, only ... (I held my hands up measuring about a<br/>foot,<br/>&gt; and jerked the distance to maybe 14 inches)&quot; and within about 15 seconds,<br/>he<br/>&gt; was soloing in sixteenth notes and such.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thing is, at that point, I&apos;d been playing the 323 a lot and sequencing a<br/>lot<br/>&gt; in it, it was a current project so my sensitivity to it was very high.<br/>Put<br/>&gt; it this way.  The main fifth in 323 sounds just.  323 is 17 times 19.  So<br/>&gt; you go a step or two in either direction you hit the 17 or 19 fifth which<br/>&gt; you could definitely hear with the guitar timbre.  The note in between is<br/>&gt; very close to 12.  So you have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;17&quot;, near just, near 12, &quot;19&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a pretty recognizable arrangement.  On a side note, this is how I<br/>was<br/>&gt; able to distinguish a lot of higher temperaments, each having a unique<br/>&gt; bouquet of useable fifths, so they sort of adopt little personality traits<br/>&gt; of the proximities of each fifth.  Anyway, I had learned over the week or<br/>so<br/>&gt; to sense the different colorations.  If anything each note is 4 cents<br/>apart<br/>&gt; or so.</p><p>in case anyone needs some help in following that ...</p><p>2^(190/323) = 2^(10/17) = ~705.8823529 cents</p><p>2^(189/323) = ~702.1671827 cents</p><p>2^(188/323) = ~698.4520124 cents</p><p>2^(187/323) = 2^(11/19) = ~694.7368421 cents</p><p>i&apos;ve also made new error-from-JI lattices at:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/eqtemp.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/eqtemp.htm</a></p><p>color ones of 34, 94, 171, 323, and 1000edo,<br/>and a greyscale as well for 94.</p><p>to me, 94 looks a lot like 41; of the lower edos,<br/>323 resembles 34, and considering the higher ones,<br/>it&apos;s very much like 1000.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
