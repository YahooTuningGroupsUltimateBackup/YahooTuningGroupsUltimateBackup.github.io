What I was talking about was a map not on<br/>scales or pitch classes, but actual pitches; however if you are<br/>considering n primes you end up transforming (n-1)-simplexes<br/>(triangles, tetrahedrons etc.) in (n-1) the (n-1)-dimensional space<br/>of pitch classes before proceeding.</p><p>Suppose we start with 1, 3 and 5, and permute them by 1-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;1. We<br/>can write this as the matrix</p><p>[0 1 0]<br/>[0 0 1]<br/>[1 0 0],</p><p>which leaves fixed the vector [1 1 1] corresponding to 15; the action<br/>is therefore reducible. We want 1 to remain fixed, so after permuting<br/>the vertices of the 1-3-5 triangle, we divide by 3; and so get<br/>1-&gt;1, 3-&gt;5/3, 5-&gt;1/3. In matrix form, this is</p><p>[1  0  0]<br/>[0 -1  1]<br/>[0 -1  0].</p><p>When we do this with all n! permutations in the symmetric group S3 on<br/>n elements, we always get a decomposition of this kind. The<br/>(n-1)x(n-1) matrix so obtained cannot be reduced futher, even over<br/>the complex numbers; it is therefore called an irreducible<br/>representation of Sn. For most purposes we stop here, but for music<br/>we must go onward and lift the irreducible representation so obtained<br/>as best we can to include octaves. It then is no longer irreducible,<br/>but we don&apos;t want it to be--we want octaves to be fixed, or else to<br/>invert. We therefore want to do one of two things--either fix 2 and<br/>send 3 to something approximately 3, 5 to an approximation of 5 and<br/>so forth, or we want to send 2 to 1/2, 3 to about 1/3 and so on.<br/>Ideally, we want the matrix that results to be of finite order, but<br/>that is of less significance; we also might not want the harmony to<br/>collpase one of the primes out of existence or do other untoward<br/>things which we can prevent by making it have determinant +-1.</p><p>If we apply these principles to the above matrix, we see that sending<br/>2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;10/3 and 5-&gt;16/3 fits the bill; we get the following matrix</p><p>[1  0  0]<br/>[1 -1  1]<br/>[4 -1  0].</p><p>This is a rotation of the hexagon surrounding 1/1 (3,5,5/3,1/3, 1/5,<br/>3/5) which Paul can no doubt give a name to by 120 degrees. We can<br/>get a 6-cycle by taking the negative of the above matrix,<br/>corresponding to 2-&gt;1/2, 3-&gt;3/20, 5-&gt;3/16, giving us a rotation of 60<br/>degrees. We now want to flip the triangle, which we can do by the<br/>permutation 1-&gt;3, 3-&gt;1, 5-&gt;5. If reduce the matrix as before, we<br/>divide by 3 and find the irreducible representation is</p><p>[-1 0]<br/>[-1 1],</p><p>which sends 1-&gt;1, 3-&gt;1/3, 5-&gt;5/3, which we can lift to a<br/>transformation including octaves by</p><p>[-1  0  0]<br/>[ 0 -1  0]<br/>[-3 -1  1],</p><p>which translates to 2-&gt;1/2, 3-&gt;1/3, 5-&gt;5/24. If we take instead minus<br/>this matrix, we get 2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;3, 5-&gt;25/4, the major &lt;--&gt; minor<br/>transformation. We now have a group of order 12 which can be seen as<br/>the dihedral group D6--the isometries of a hexagon. Each element<br/>either preserves or inverts octaves, and correspondingly either keeps<br/>the 3-et</p><p>[3]<br/>[5]<br/>[7]</p><p>invariant, or inverts it. Note that like all of these groups, it acts<br/>on more than just a single triad or a single hexagon--the group<br/>elements send 5-limit music to 5-limit music, octaves to octaves or<br/>inverted ocatves, and triads to triads (not necesarily in the same<br/>position--that is root, first inversion and second inversion are<br/>permuted.)</p><p>If we want to do something corresponding in the 11-limit, we run into<br/>the difficulty that 3^2 = 9 is, after all, smaller than 11. There are<br/>various approaches to this problem, the simplest being to ignore it.<br/>If we take that line, we might began by looking at the 5-cycle<br/>permutation 1-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;7-&gt;11-&gt;1. The element in the irreducible<br/>representation of S5 corresponding to this we may obtain by dividing<br/>everything transformed by the above by 3 (so that as usual 1 is sent<br/>to 1), giving us the matrix</p><p>[-1 1 0 0]<br/>[-1 0 1 0]<br/>[-1 0 0 1]<br/>[-1 0 0 0]</p><p>We can lift this to include 2 by setting 2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;10/3, 5-&gt;14/3,<br/>7-&gt;22/3, 11-&gt;32/3; giving us the matrix</p><p>[1  0  0  0  0]<br/>[1 -1  1  0  0]<br/>[1 -1  0  1  0]<br/>[1 -1  0  0  1]<br/>[5 -1  0  0  0]</p><p>This is of order five, and it preserves the vector</p><p>[ 5]<br/>[ 8]<br/>[11]<br/>[14]<br/>[17]</p><p>The full group one gets in this way is in general <a href="http://2.Sn">2.Sn</a>, of order 2n!;<br/>in this case that means a group of order 240.
