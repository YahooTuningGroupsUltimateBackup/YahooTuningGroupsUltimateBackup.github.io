I took out a provisional patent in early 1992 and visited a<br/>couple of Japanese keyboard manufacturers that year with the idea.  I<br/>then made the idea public because it was going to cost me about $50,000<br/>for world patents and there was an old patent that did the 5 ratios<br/>correctly (and the 3s were already OK) and so it covered 90% of the<br/>cases already.</p><p>Does Paul&apos;s paper predate 1994?</p><p>Re period doubling:  It seems that I must have got confused between<br/>frequency doubling and period doubling but I knew it was doubling and<br/>not halving   ;^)   The reason no doubt is that I spent 15 years on the<br/>harmonics theory which does have frequency doubling.</p><p>I still don&apos;t think that the undertones are chaos even though I was<br/>confused about this.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=3688 href="#3688">ðŸ”—</a>perlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</h3><span>6/19/1999 12:03:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ray Tomes wrote,</p><p>&gt;Does Paul&apos;s paper predate 1994?</p><p>Which Paul?

If you study chaos theory, you might find the phenomenon of<br/>bifurcation fits Jim Cole&apos;s description, and even your explantion,<br/>of the phenomenon very closely.</p></div>
