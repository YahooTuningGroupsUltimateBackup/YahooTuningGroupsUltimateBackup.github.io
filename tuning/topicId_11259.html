The diatonic scale doesn&apos;t contain all of the intervals of 19-tET.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&#x9;I could be completely wrong, but I&apos;m thinking of Yasser&apos;s series of<br/>5th-generated scales, where the pentatonic is tuned in 7-tET,  the diatonic<br/>scale is tuned to 12-tET, the chromatic scale of 12 notes is tuned in<br/>19-tET, and so on.  These scales are always strictly proper when tuned to<br/>an ET two places higher in the series 5, 7, 12 . . . (3 isn&apos;t on the list,<br/>actually), such as the pentatonic 22323, but always proper but ambiguous in<br/>one degree (and it&apos;s inversion) when tuned in an ET one place higher: as in<br/>11212.  Also, in later case, I observed that the scale always exhausts the<br/>interval set of the tuning system.  I&apos;m not positive, however, whether it&apos;s<br/>always the proper subset of lowest cardnality in the system to do so, but<br/>that&apos;s the claim I was making.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Wilson&apos;s diagrams of scales generated by series of equal intervals<br/>&gt;&gt;elegantly show, I think, that the series of fifths (approximate 3/2&apos;s) are<br/>&gt;&gt;special in generating the most stable (in Rothenberg&apos;s sense) scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can you demonstrate this?  I would be surprised if there are any special<br/>&gt;generators here -- all generators should turn out their fair share of both<br/>&gt;proper and improper scales, if the chaining is carried out far enough.</p><p>&#x9;Again, I could be wrong, but I have the rudiments of a proof in this case.<br/> The property I&apos;m looking for is the greatest number of high-stability<br/>scales in the sequence of scales generated by the interval.  It&apos;s<br/>important, then, that the sequence produces stable scales very quickly,<br/>that is, with relatively few iterations (discarding the 1 and 2 note<br/>cases).  Restricting consideration to generators between the unison and the<br/>tritone (1/2 8ve in log freq), since their inversions generate equivalent<br/>scales in Rothenberg&apos;s sense, we first notice that small intervals fail the<br/>criterion because it takes too many repetitions to cycle through the 8ve.<br/>This has two consequences: there&apos;s an imbalance in the scale until just<br/>before the interval cycles through the 8ve, so proper scales come only at<br/>such a point, and if this occurs fewer times, then there are fewer<br/>potential proper scales.  Second, after (or just before) the generator<br/>cycles through the 8ve, the newest tone will create an interval with the<br/>original tone smaller than any which existed in the scale before.  The<br/>first such interval divides the generator itself (which had previously been<br/>the smallest interval).  The generator which creates the greatest number of<br/>proper scales must have the largest number of succesively smaller minimum<br/>intervals.  But if the generator, which itself is the first minimum<br/>interval, is already small, then the next smallest interval must be smaller<br/>still, and the total number of intervals on the list of succesive minimum<br/>intervals will be fewer than in the case of a larger generator, if we stop<br/>the list at some arbitrary interval, such as 1 step of a given ET.<br/>However, this doesn&apos;t mean that the very largest interval is the best.  The<br/>interval nearest to the tritone in an odd-numbered ET will always generate<br/>the interval of 1 step after its second iteration.  So the best interval<br/>will always be a step below this interval in lower numbered ET&apos;s &gt; 9, and<br/>as we get into higher ET&apos;s it will fall a greater number of steps below it<br/>(but since the steps are growing increasingly smaller, this translates into<br/>a generator of relatively stable absolute frequency).<br/>&#x9;Paul also contends this point.  I see two possible reasons for disagreeing<br/>with it.  Any generator, as you say, excluding intervals that divide the<br/>8ve by an interger in log freq, will produce an infinite number of proper<br/>scales.  But this disregards the number of tones in these scales.  I&apos;m<br/>interested in the generator which produces proper scales the most<br/>frequently, that is, produces x number of proper scales with the fewest<br/>number of iterations.  You also might contend that the argument above<br/>depends upon the use of equal tunings.  If we allow that an interval in<br/>some equal tuning serves as an adequate approximation of an interval<br/>otherwise defined (say, by a rational freq ratio) then the reasoning above<br/>finds the best generators (most frequent proper scales) given some<br/>restricted range in the cardinality of the ET&apos;s.  In actuality, the<br/>argument doesn&apos;t necessarily depend on ET&apos;s, but depends on the abelian<br/>groups represented by ET&apos;s.  The prelude to Tristan und Isolde is in a<br/>twelve note cyclic system whether or not the orchestra performing it<br/>intones it to an accurate 12tET within some margin of error (unless that<br/>margin is &gt; 50 cents).  Are cyclic groups perceptually real?  I can&apos;t say,<br/>but from experience I feel that every piece of music sets up an expectation<br/>of a minimum step, which doesn&apos;t mean minimum with reference to some<br/>absolute standard in freq or log freq ratio (we might say, Western music<br/>sets up a 100 cent minimum, but that would be wrong, because a raised<br/>leading tone doesn&apos;t upset the expectation), but a minimum with reference<br/>to the number of distinct tones per 8ve, tuned however.  If this is<br/>correct, then my line of reasoning sets a limit on a perceptually real<br/>factor: the minimum interval, or saturation of the 8ve.<br/>&#x9;You also responded to my point that this analysis might explain the use of<br/>5ths in the generation of scales in many musical cultures, saying that this<br/>fact is better explained by the concordance of the 3/2.  The stumbling<br/>block of this latter reasoning (this is not a point of my own invention) is<br/>that such scales exist in cultures where harmony doesn&apos;t exist.  You might<br/>counter this by saying that the concordance of the 3/2, because it&apos;s so<br/>powerful, can be percieved in melodic situations.  I would agree: I have<br/>found that difference tones (a relatively weak phenomenon of harmony) are<br/>clearly perceptable in certain melodic situations, rapid sequences of high<br/>pitched tones.  I don&apos;t know if this is also true ourdoors.<br/>Psychoacoustical evidence, however, shows that while the mistuning of<br/>certain rational intervals is perceptable on the order of a cent when heard<br/>vertically, such intervals are not tunable when heard melodically and<br/>separated by a short pause.  Notes separated by fifths and fourths tend not<br/>to occur in direct succession in melodies (there may be some exceptions:<br/>Venda music?).  In any case, a stronger point is that many musical systems<br/>using fifth-generated scales employ non-harmonic and rapid decay toned<br/>idiophones such as xylophone-type instruments, where the consonance of the<br/>3/2 is irrelevant.</p><p>jason</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2000 1:09:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Jason_Yust &lt;jason_yust@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  The property I&apos;m looking for is the greatest number of<br/>high-stability<br/>&gt; scales in the sequence of scales generated by the interval.

I suggested you try<br/>a<br/>generator of 2^(phi), as well as the other noble generators shown as<br/>convergence point of the zigzags in Wilson&apos;s scale tree (http://<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/scaletree.html">www.anaphoria.com/scaletree.html</a>). The 2^(phi) generator, whose<br/>location on the horizontal axis in the scale tree is given by the<br/>number phi = 1.6180339887, produces proper scales with 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,<br/>13, and, as you can see in <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/ST22.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/ST22.html</a>, 21,<br/>34,<br/>55, 89, 144, etc. notes (i.e., all the Fibonacci numbers).<br/>Mathematically, the noble generators have the property that when<br/>their<br/>logarithmic size, as a proportion of the octave, is expressed as a<br/>continued fraction, the expansion ends in a infinite succession of<br/>1s.<br/>Your observation about Yasser&apos;s series is not irrelevant, since the<br/>same series of proper scales is produced by chaining Kornerup&apos;s<br/>golden<br/>fifth, which I believe is also a noble proportion of the octave. It<br/>does not appear in the scale tree because the first two steps, 2/5<br/>and<br/>5/7, Yasser&apos;s &quot;sub-infra diatonic&quot; and &quot;infra-diatonic&quot; scales, are<br/>not<br/>adjacent entries in the tree. However, the corresponding series 2, 5,<br/>7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81, 131, etc. does not compare unfavorably with<br/>the<br/>Fibonacci series generated by the 2^(phi) generator, except that the<br/>&quot;degree of propriety&quot; at each stage is greater with the latter.</p><p>&gt; I see two possible reasons for disagreeing<br/>&gt; with it.  Any generator, as you say, excluding intervals that<br/>divide the<br/>&gt; 8ve by an interger in log freq, will produce an infinite number of<br/>proper<br/>&gt; scales.

They occur<br/>even between sine waves when played harmonically, so certainly they<br/>occur with xylophon-like timbres, but I&apos;m suspicious about your claim<br/>that they occur melodically -- you must have overlapping decays or<br/>something. In any case, you will not find that the 3:2 is at all a<br/>special generator when considered on the basis of how often it<br/>produces<br/>proper scales. And in fact, in cultures where these xylophone-like<br/>timbres are used, the generator often deviates quite far from 3:2 (or<br/>7/12 octave): in Thailand it is 4/7 octave, and in Indonesia it is<br/>either approximately 3/5 octave, or approximately 5/9 octave, for<br/>slendro and pelog, respectively. The fact that all these generators<br/>are<br/>within 35 cents of a 3:2 ratio is, I believe, rooted in the vocal<br/>basis<br/>of these musical cultures. If the octave were truly the only<br/>acoustically relevant interval, and propriety at various stages of<br/>the<br/>construction of a scale from a single generator was the only<br/>criterion,<br/>there would be no reason to choose a 3:2 ratio or anything near it.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2000 10:07:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, I think this is true of any series-of-fifths-gerenated scale<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;tuned in the next highest ET in the series 3, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Eh?
