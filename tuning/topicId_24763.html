Simply testing<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; finished product won&apos;t work, because it doesn&apos;t guarantee &quot;intent.&quot;  For<br/>&gt; now,<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to a wedding.  Now, you might not believe I am actually going to<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; wedding, and challenge this assertion.  But it will still be true. :)  (no,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s not my wedding.)  Bye for now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>I will trust a machine over your best guess any day of the week. You are not<br/>more accurate than a machine. To say this is naive to say the least. Have you<br/>never experienced the accuracy of a computer? Perhaps you just dont<br/>understand how those machines work and are scared of technology testing you<br/>and discovering just how wrong you are. You would gain skills by realizing<br/>that men before you have created machines that can help you improve your<br/>accuracy and show you also how accurate you are. I can see however that this<br/>thread is going no where ... I will just have to test recordings myself and<br/>show this. With this in mind, anyone still listening, anyone know of a good<br/>piece to test with this music?</p><p>This isn&apos;t a question of me being skeptical for the sake of playing devils<br/>advocate.</p><p>Andy</p></div>
