Either compose (and perform) or improvise a piece that demonstrates the<br/>richness.<br/>&gt;2. Record the results.<br/>&gt;3. Post it on the web somewhere.</p><p>&gt;It would be worth so much, maybe more than a _paper_.</p><p>&gt;Musically, all yours,<br/>&gt;Jon</p><p>I wholeheartedly agree! For an improvisation, I would need a<br/>27-tone-per-octave JI instrument, where the connections in the lattice<br/>diagram would be visible due to layout, coloration, or other means.<br/>Otherwise, I could attempt a composition and performance using my Ensoniq<br/>keyboard, but that would take some time. I&apos;d like to get around to it<br/>someday. Right now my musical efforts are focused on a new (but years in the<br/>making) band and we&apos;re writing and improvising in 12-equal at the moment.<br/>Once we get off the ground, and I am confident that we will, 22-equal is<br/>around the corner, as two of the four of us have performed with it already<br/>(and a third is just the drummer :). It&apos;s too soon to say, but I wouldn&apos;t be<br/>surprised if we end up using other tuning systems as well, including<br/>non-equal ones.</p><p>Otherwise, I still feel my efforts to be of value. I posted that particular<br/>lattice because Joe Monzo had just asked me in an e-mail to draw some.<br/>Someone who likes lots of consonant 7-limit JI harmony might decide that<br/>they want to write a piece whose melodic resources divide the octave into<br/>three parts, with each of those divided into three parts, and each of those<br/>divided into three parts. Maybe they&apos;re reading this list and find what<br/>they&apos;re looking for. I know that several people on the list have been<br/>inspired by my original ideas about 22-equal to obtain or create, and play,<br/>instruments in that tuning; one in particular sent me e-mail after<br/>joy-filled e-mail as he proceeded to discover for himself the musical value<br/>of item after item in my paper.</p><p>My 12-equal music also gives many people a lot of joy. I often get powerful,<br/>emotional responses from people and that is why I believe I am on the right<br/>path. I know that there is a lot of negative feeling toward me around here<br/>but I am really just trying to make people happy and make their lives<br/>richer. Sometimes I am argumentative or harsh but I believe that the truth<br/>will ultimately be more beneficial than misconceptions. Not that I always<br/>know the truth, or am always right, but I&apos;ve thought and listened hard and<br/>read widely on this stuff and sometimes I will have knowledge or a point of<br/>view to share. I&apos;m here to share and to learn. May we all do the same!</p><p>I&apos;m off to perform (yes, plain old 12-equal guitar tonight). Let the flames<br/>begin!</p></div>
