The sociology of one of the lists to<br/>which I have subscribed in the past (the Pynchon list) has even become the<br/>subject of journalistic attention.</p><p>So the tuning list has had a spell of bad feelings. So what? Although it<br/>would have been better form to have taken the conflict completely off-list,<br/>and to have kept off-list comments private, I think little harm has been done<br/>by this episode.</p><p>The more important question that has been raised is that of list content.<br/>There has been a complaint about having &quot;too much math&quot; in postings.</p><p>I disagree with this. The topics covered by this list are refreshingly<br/>diverse and that diversity seems to demand a variety of approaches, one of<br/>which has some numerical content.  (In fact, the math involved is almost<br/>trivial and as far as I know, only Paul Hahn has produced theoretical items<br/>in the rigorous terms of  mathematical proofs).  Each of the approaches will<br/>have advantages and shortcomings, each approach will followed more or less<br/>closely by individual readers, and the delete button is always there for the<br/>completely uninterested.</p><p>We all have our own disinterests and impatiences: I could care less about<br/>Barbershop, Phish or Wendy Carlos, I found the discussion of putative blues<br/>scales very odd, as are the writings of one contributer who choose to frame<br/>everything in terms of his own autobiography, and I still don&apos;t follow why<br/>Paul Erlich needs to use entropy.  I&apos;m sure that my own postings are often<br/>the subject of someone&apos;s delete button.  But the tuning list represents a<br/>rich musical landscape, and I wouldn&apos;t want to lose any detail of that<br/>landscape, just because I don&apos;t follow it closely.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div><h3><a id=4158 href="#4158">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/1999 11:03:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan!<br/>    I believe I am the only one that made any comment along these lines. My<br/>point was not against math. It is the use of math without any attempt to convey<br/>anything to those not on the same level as them. Chomsky has talked alot about<br/>this use of language. The purpose of specialized languages not for communication<br/>but the setting up of a ELITE.<br/>I caught one post with the words &quot;math&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; in the same sentence that<br/>seemed to imply a certain attitude.<br/>    If I don&apos;t understand something i just ask. I know of others (via<br/>communcations) on this list who are too intimidated to ask, which is my point.<br/>    I fully agree in the fine examples of math appropriateness to this list!</p><p><a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; The more important question that has been raised is that of list content.<br/>&gt; There has been a complaint about having &quot;too much math&quot; in postings.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
