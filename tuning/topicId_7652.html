But after comparing the two<br/>&gt;I came to like the JI version better.</p><p>Yeah, the first time I played JI chords using MIDI, they sounded<br/>out-of-tune to me.  Then my opinion would shift.  I wondered if JI was an<br/>&quot;acquired taste&quot;.  But then I figured, well then, equal temperament is an<br/>&quot;acquired BAD taste&quot;.</p><p>Regarding &lt;<a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/dom7.htm">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/dom7.htm</a>&gt;,<br/>At 05:41 PM 1/6/00 -0800, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Blind chord test:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Didn&apos;t like Z: too harsh<br/>&gt;W and Y were nice but a little too mellow to be<br/>&gt;  good 7th chords<br/>&gt;X was just harsh enough.</p><p>Just so you&apos;ll know, the &quot;scrambling&quot; I did was as follows:</p><p>        Z = the 1st tuning: F is 7th harmonic of G<br/>        Y = the 2nd tuning: F is up 2 4ths from G (my favorite)<br/>        X = the 3rd tuning: F is up a minor 3rd from G<br/>        W = the 4th tuning: equal temperament</p><p>(In other words, I just ran the alphabet backwards, &apos;cuz I was lazy.)</p><p>So you preferred X = the 3rd tuning.  It&apos;s interesting to see the different<br/>adjectives people use when they describe sounds.</p><p>I think this whole tuning issue is boiling down to how harsh or smooth the<br/>chords &quot;should&quot; be.  The case of the Dominant Seventh chord is tricky, &apos;cuz<br/>on the one hand, I&apos;m voting for smoothness (just intonation is smoother<br/>than equal temperament), but on the other hand I&apos;m voting for harshness<br/>(the chord is unresolved, consonance isn&apos;t really the main goal of the chord).</p><p>So maybe that&apos;s why everybody&apos;s got a different opinion about it.  It hard<br/>to make a chord smooth and not smooth at the same time.</p><p>Thanks again for your input,</p><p>--Mark (<a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>, AKA <a href="mailto:tuning-owner@onelist.com">tuning-owner@onelist.com</a>)</p><p>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;   |<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>__________________________________________<br/>NetZero - Defenders of the Free World<br/>Get your FREE Internet Access and Email at<br/><a href="http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html">http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html</a></p></div>
