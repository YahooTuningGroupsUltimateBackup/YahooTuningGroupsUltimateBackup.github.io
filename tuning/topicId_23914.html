One less arbitrary thing to worry about.</p><p>You mean &quot;a handle on the decatonic ideas&quot;? Yes. I agree with this<br/>point. As a compromise, could you come up with a completely different<br/>pair of ASCII accidentals for the decimal system. i.e other than<br/>[&lt;v^&gt;]. I guess they should be other than +-/\ too. And of course you<br/>wouldn&apos;t want to use {} or () for the same reason you don&apos;t want to<br/>use &lt;&gt;. And you can&apos;t use #b|; and you don&apos;t want to use punctuation<br/>marks that look like &quot;line noise&quot;. Or anything that might be mistaken<br/>for a half-sharp or half-flat. Doesn&apos;t leave much does it?</p><p>An underscore &quot;_&quot; is clearly &quot;down&quot; or &quot;low&quot; but what could you pair<br/>with it? Double-quote &quot;&quot;&quot;? Tilde &quot;~&quot;? Asterisk &quot;*&quot;? Yeah how about</p><p>9_ 9  9*</p><p>Trouble is you can&apos;t tell which line the underscore belongs to, in</p><p>9_<br/>9</p><p>Maybe * is ok as an ascender. How about pairing it with something else<br/>that descends. qypgj? I think p is already used for something. y and j<br/>look like the best bets to me. j looks like ] but if j is only used<br/>for ASCIIfied decimal notation that wouldn&apos;t matter.</p><p>9j 9  9*</p><p>9y 9  9*</p><p>If you can&apos;t find anything that satisfies you, and you still want to<br/>use ^ and v for the ASCII decimal accidental, could you please include<br/>a warning with your legend.
