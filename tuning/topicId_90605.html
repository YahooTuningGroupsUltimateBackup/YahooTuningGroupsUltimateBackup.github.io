If you select the &quot;User&quot; option in the &quot;Project Settings&gt;Tuning&quot; dialog, you can tweak the pitch of each of the 12 notes in the octave as much as 100 cents (one semitone) sharp or flat, at a resolution of 0.1 cents.  So if you have a particular microtonal scale that you want to try, and you know the cents values of each step of the scale (in one octave), you can manually retune Logic to that scale (provided the scale has no more than 12 notes per octave, and no given note is further than 1 semitone from its nearest 12-tET &quot;counterpart&quot;).</p><p>You are correct that having Logic in a pure tuning will conflict with your equal-tempered guitar.  However, Logic&apos;s &quot;Pitch Correction&quot; plug-in can be set to use the &quot;global&quot; tuning, so if you have a monophonic guitar part, you can pitch-correct it to match the &quot;pure&quot; notes.  Not the best way to go about things, of course, but it can get the job done in a pinch.  Or so I assume; I&apos;ve never tried it myself, but it seems like it should work!</p><p>Perhaps you could introduce yourself a bit?

I have always loved Indian classical music although I am Chinese and have not had any training in Indian music at all.

I like Somei Satoh as well and while I know Reich does not use any alternate tunings for his music, Harrison and Satoh did. The sonorities cannot be gotten with tempered tuning I am sure. I also play (besides the conventional guitar) a small Indonesian recorder which resists accompaniment simply because it is tuned to another system altogether, but it sounds truly beguiling.<br/>As for your suggestion to utilise Logic&apos;s Pitch Correction for audio tracks like my guitar parts, I don t know if I would even try. First I have already tried their &apos;audio to MIDI&apos; option with simple and clear monophonic lines and it did not track at all well. Many attempts in fact.

This new music has already been set in Logic to various tunings, some in Hermode tuning, several use one or two Chinese tunings and one uses a Gamelan tuning.

Or you could try a fretless instrument...if you&apos;re in Singapore, you should have no trouble finding a guqin for cheap.  Or you could just take the frets off of your guitar, fill in the slots with wood-putty, and paint on position markers under each string for all the Just pitches you want (you can find the pitches by ear, just play the desired pitch on the keyboard and move your finger around on the string until you find the right spot for it).  Actually, if you don&apos;t mind using what is basically a &quot;drone&quot; tuning (tune all your open strings to the same note, or maybe the same two notes), there&apos;s a simple method of using fishing line to make frets.
