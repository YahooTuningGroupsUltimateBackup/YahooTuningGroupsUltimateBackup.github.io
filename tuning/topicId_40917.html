I have put this effect to good use in my<br/>temperament lecture/presentation/dare that I give to piano technician&apos;s<br/>conventions and chapter meetings, (last was the Canadian organization, next<br/>is the PTG national in Dallas).<br/>     I had previously simply used a well-tempered piano to demonstrate the<br/>composers&apos; use of various keys for different effects.  Beginning in G<br/>(usually Bach&apos;s French suite stuff), then contrasting that with something in<br/>Ab to demo how different thing were on opposite sides of the circle of<br/>fifths,  I was able to &apos;attune&apos; the ears to the different tonal qualities<br/>found.  For the remainder of the 90 minutes or so, we walked around the keys,<br/>listening to what happened to music in them.   Then,  in Texas several years<br/>ago,  there were two concert pianos on stage and one had been left in ET.  At<br/>the end of the program, one of the techs stood up and said, &quot;OK,  let&apos;s hear<br/>that last piece on the ET piano&quot;.  We rolled it out and listened.  The crowd<br/>was amazed at how out of tune it sounded, and it was a very clean ET!<br/>    Since then, I have used this comparison repeatedly, and the results are<br/>the same, everytime.  I warn the group that I intend to shift their<br/>perspective in 90 minutes.  (Piano tuners tend to be square pegs, and I<br/>notice more than a few backs stiffen, arms cross, and eyebrows go up).  Then<br/>we listen first to the ET piano, and it is easy to get everyone to agree that<br/>it sounds fine.  Pushing the 13.7 cent thirds aside for the next hour and a<br/>half, we take a tonality tour.  When we return to the once fine sounding ET,<br/>the epiphanies pile up on top of themselves.  It is like shooting fish in a<br/>barrell.<br/>    On the piano, the use of a well-temperament is also a strong factor in<br/>how much pedal can be employed.  Pianists have all learned that the original<br/>pedal markings of the classical composers can&apos;t be used on the modern piano<br/>because the increased sustain &quot;muddies&quot; the music.  However, what we are<br/>finding is that the ever-present haze of tempering in ET is what is doing the<br/>roiling, and when something like a Young or a Prelleur, or even a Kirnberger<br/>is used, the pedal can be held down far longer and still allow clarity.  And,<br/>the more pedal that is used, the more resonance the instrument can produce.<br/>This is usually a good thing.<br/>    It is an ongoing project to determine why there is a sense of increased<br/>clarity in the WT&apos;s.  Even the keys more highly tempered than ET seem to be<br/>&quot;richer&quot; sounding, when my logic would have told me that the modern listener<br/>would sense them as harsher.  Perhaps it was the genius of Beethoven, Haydn,<br/>and others that creates this effect, though the jazz players around here are<br/>coming to accept the WT palette as more usable than ET.<br/>    I have come to believe that the everpresent use of 12 ET has inured the<br/>modern ear. It has dulled the reception of great music and the musical world<br/>at large is unaware of the loss.   In order to accept this tuning, one must<br/>be desensitized to the physical effect of the tonal<br/>palette,(consonance/dissonance).  Once this happens, the music&apos;s effect is<br/>left dependant on intellectual interpretation.  In contrast,  the unequal<br/>tunings create a psycho-emotive effect that is independant of the intellect,<br/>hence, interjecting a greater degree of complexity into the &quot;meaning&quot; of the<br/>music.  (Here I use &apos;meaning&apos; to denote a message being received, not a<br/>unique property of the message, itself.)  This is new territory for many that<br/>have spent their lives with old music, but there IS an awakening going on in<br/>the piano world.<br/>    We got to the domination of ET rather slowly, it is quite an eye-opener<br/>to most musicians to go back to the well-tempered world all at once, but once<br/>succesfully taken there, they rarely want to come back.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div>
