Pitch-height is the more<br/>obvious one, which is simply our perception of a<br/>tone as being at a particular place somewhere<br/>in the audible pitch-continuum, because of the<br/>particular cochlear hairs that are stimulated by that<br/>frequency.  This is quite obviously and literally<br/>&quot;up or down in pitch&quot;.</p><p>Chroma is our perception of pitch based on periodicity<br/>of neural firing.  In my opinion and theories, this<br/>involves primarily prime-factoring of the frequency<br/>ratios (perhaps others would admit  just odd-factoring).<br/>So in a way, this is a kind of &quot;sideways in pitch&quot;.</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/1999 7:21:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph L Monzo &lt;<a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Chroma is our perception of pitch based on periodicity<br/>&gt;of neural firing.

Please describe if you can, (how to generate?) two sounds that have the same pitch-height but slightly different, and then very different, &quot;chroma&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t think neurons can fire fast enough to keep up. Time in the audio signal doesn&apos;t need to be (and is very unlikely to be) represented as time in the brain. Also note that there is no need for the brain to compute prime factorisations (again very unlikely) in order for primes to have auditory significance.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

Read up<br/>on your psychoacoustics (I recommend Roederer highly).</p></div>
