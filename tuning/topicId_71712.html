But for some intervals like 11/7 ,72 may be is better but this difference is not important for me.<br/>I think concepts such as musical culture(and therefore melody , harmony ,consonace ....) , personal taste and usefulness of a tuning system have effects on goodness of system besides limit.Isn&apos;t it so?</p><p>Shaahin Mohajeri</p><p>Tombak Player &amp; Researcher , Microtonal Composer</p><p>My web site?? ???? ????? ??????  &lt;<a href="http://240edo.googlepages.com/">http://240edo.googlepages.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>My farsi page in Harmonytalk   ???? ??????? ?? ??????? ???  &lt;<a href="http://www.harmonytalk.com/mohajeri">http://www.harmonytalk.com/mohajeri</a>&gt;</p><p>Shaahin Mohajeri in Wikipedia  ????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ???? ???? &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaahin_mohajeri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaahin_mohajeri</a>&gt;</p><p>________________________________</p><p>From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> [<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Gene Ward Smith<br/>Sent: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 12:13 AM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: From mohajeri To Reinhard - unsolicited comment</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; , &quot;Mohajeri Shahin&quot; &lt;shahinm@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi charles<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for your recomendation.But i have choosen 96 for:<br/>&gt; 1-good approximation of 5,7,11 and 13-limit ratios.<br/>&gt; 2-good melodic approximation for natural behavior of persian music.<br/>&gt; 3-divisions of quartertone up to 4.</p><p>&quot;Good&quot; is a gross exaggeration. It&apos;s &quot;good&quot; in the sense that anything<br/>that size is &quot;good&quot;, but it&apos;s not even 7-limit consistent and the 7 is<br/>about as bad as it can be for a division that fine. It will, of course,<br/>serve--because it *is* that fine. But only for that reason.</p><p>In that size range, notable are 94 and 99. If you want divisibility by<br/>12, 72 or possibly 84 are self-recommending.</p></div>
