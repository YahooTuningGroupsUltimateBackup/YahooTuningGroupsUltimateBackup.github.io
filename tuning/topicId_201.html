There is no way<br/>&gt; to account for room tempiture and the manner which a player sits, both<br/>&gt; have a profound effect on the tone of the instument.</p><p>   The unfortunate truth, from what I&apos;ve seen anyway, is that if it sounds<br/>enough like a sitar, the sorts of things that the real sitar will provide that<br/>the electronic simulation won&apos;t, are exactly what many audiences expect to<br/>hear.</p><p>   A while ago, somebody on the list was looking for good electronic violin<br/>simulation with no vibrato, because he didn&apos;t want the vibrato to confuse the<br/>harmonies of his unusual tuning.  Sorry folks, but that&apos;s just not going to go<br/>over with most audiences.  It would, if people could think of a vibratoless<br/>violin as an interesting sound in itself, but very few audiences (blugrass<br/>fiddling being a notable exception) will.  Instead they&apos;ll say, &quot;gaaaaack,<br/>that violin sounds hideous!&quot;.</p><p>   If on the other hand, it doesn&apos;t sound like anything in paticular, they<br/>accept it as something new and take it for exactly what it is.  They may or may<br/>not like it, but at least they won&apos;t hold it to the same extremely detailed<br/>standard as a &quot;real&quot; violin.</p><p>   That&apos;s what I&apos;ve found anyway.</p></div><h3><a id=207 href="#207">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/1999 5:30:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    The unfortunate truth, from what I&apos;ve seen anyway, is that if it sounds<br/>&gt; enough like a sitar, the sorts of things that the real sitar will provide that<br/>&gt; the electronic simulation won&apos;t, are exactly what many audiences expect to<br/>&gt; hear.</p><p>   I should clarify that, even though I used presence or absense of vibrato as an<br/>example of this, I was merely citing a simplified case to illustrate my point.<br/>The sorts of things people seem to look for are mostly a lot more subtle than<br/>vibrato or not.</p></div>
