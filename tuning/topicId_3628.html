However, the &quot;intonational<br/>politics&quot; of this dialogue often tends to focus on vertical intervals,<br/>rather than on melodic factors.</p><p>As someone who likes to point out the positive vertical role an 81:64<br/>can play in medieval polyphony, I should emphasize that the ditone<br/>wasn&apos;t the creation of some polyphonic composer or theorist who said,<br/>&quot;Let&apos;s make those thirds nice and unstable so that we can have dynamic<br/>cadences!&quot; Rather, as the name &quot;ditone&quot; itself suggests, this interval<br/>was originally the melodic product of two pure 9:8 whole-steps.</p><p>Thus it wasn&apos;t a question of vocal coaches exhorting monastic or<br/>courtly singers: &quot;Don&apos;t make those thirds too pure or blending!&quot;<br/>Rather it might have been a question simply of singing pure 9:8 steps<br/>(or in reality close approximations, of course), with something close<br/>to 81:64 major thirds (melodic or vertical) resulting.</p><p>While keyboard intonations do not bind voices -- the ditone at 81:64<br/>on a Pythagorean keyboard was originally a result of simple<br/>mathematics based on the powers of 3:2, as opposed to an aesthetic<br/>decision, &quot;Let&apos;s have active thirds!&quot; -- the change in keyboard<br/>intonations around 1400-1470 may reflect a shift in musical tastes<br/>which could have affected vocal intonation styles as well.</p><p>Also, not only can (and _must_) singers vary from fixed-pitch schemes;<br/>they may vary in musically meaningful ways. For example, one of the<br/>treatises of the Berkeley Manuscript (part dating to 1375) suggests a<br/>threefold division of the whole-tone which Oliver Ellsworth has read<br/>as 19-tet -- but further specifies that while a usual mi-fa is<br/>2/3-tone, at cadences one sings an ascending semitone of only<br/>1/3-tone.</p><p>Like the much more extensive (and explicitly polyphonic) discussion of<br/>tuning by Marchettus of Padua (1318), this source provides a clear<br/>record of the concept of _variable_ intonation in the 14th century.</p><p>In fact, while Marchettus&apos;s system has received much discussion on<br/>this newsgroup and elsewhere as we attempt to interpret his divisions<br/>of the tone, I would say that his indisputable and often undervalued<br/>accomplishment was to propose that the same intervals may be tuned<br/>differently depending on the musical context. Certainly I&apos;ve done my<br/>fair share of neglecting this vital point &lt;grin&gt;. He likes very wide<br/>major thirds and sixths at cadences -- whether one guesses that they<br/>might be realized near 7-limit or otherwise.</p><p>With due diplomacy, maybe I should briefly comment on some of the<br/>&quot;intonational politics&quot; which can color discussions such as this one,<br/>especially as perceived (not necessarily objectively) by some of us<br/>who call ourselves &quot;medievalists.&quot;</p><p>For most of the past 200 years -- and indeed as early as the<br/>Renaissance -- medieval music has been typically viewed as<br/>&quot;intolerably dissonant&quot; or &quot;the barbarian counterpoint of the Gothic<br/>era&quot; or actually &quot;morally impossible.&quot; This last comment was offered<br/>by a 19th-century writer who found the parallel fifths and fourths of<br/>early polyphony almost literally unthinkable, and questioned whether<br/>the treatises were _really_ describing such a practice.</p><p>Even in recent textbooks, some of them very serious histories of<br/>undoubted merit, we find passages describing the full quintal/quartal<br/>harmonies of the 13th-century as &quot;open and hollow.&quot; Maybe I could say<br/>&quot;rich and spacious,&quot; but hardly &quot;hollow&quot; -- unless one is listening<br/>using the wrong framework. Indeed Bach&apos;s saturated triadic harmonies<br/>might sound &quot;plain and simple&quot; when contrasted with the ninth and<br/>eleventh chords of 20th-century pop harmony, but music history texts<br/>hardly offer such a description as an objective one.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that the question of tuning rarely comes up in<br/>older and newer texts of this kind. The music is treated the way it is<br/>not because it may have been performed in 3-limit rather than 5-limit<br/>or 7-limit just intonation, but because it uses fifths and fourths as<br/>the prime concords. It is almost as if anyone who would prefer these<br/>intervals to thirds and sixths must be either acting under the<br/>compulsion of some extramusical authority, or preferring purely<br/>mathematical models to &quot;what sounds good.&quot; The fact that many<br/>innovative 20th-century composers have written in quintal/quartal<br/>styles does not seem to modify such judgments -- although other<br/>authors have eloquently noted the parallels (pun intended).</p><p>Interestingly, it was one of the leaders of the Alternate Tunings<br/>Movement, Joseph Yasser, who wrote in defense of _Medieval Quartal<br/>Harmony_ a bit more than 60 years ago.</p><p>Indeed, the interest in Just Intonation as well as other alternative<br/>tunings should ideally promote a great interest in the range of world<br/>musics, composed and otherwise, be they quintal/quartal, tertian, or<br/>otherwise.</p><p>The expanded interest in performing historical European musics with<br/>historical tunings and temperaments -- a trend to which I&apos;m a newcomer<br/>by comparison with the many veterans here -- represents a real<br/>fulfillment of this vision, however partial.</p><p>For tertian music such as the vocal and instrumental polyphony of the<br/>Renaissance, that movement rightly champions 5-limit just intonation<br/>or the historical approximation of meantone for keyboards. When it<br/>comes to this music, I would gladly join in accolades to the pure<br/>third, and in practice enthusiastically favor meantone (which not only<br/>makes major thirds pure but compromises my beloved fifths and fourths).</p><p>However, some views propounded in the name of &quot;JI advocacy&quot; seem to me<br/>uncomfortably like the old anti-medievalism I describe above. Pure<br/>major thirds at 5:4 are taken not as one historical ideal, not even as<br/>a widespread tendency of many world musics, but as a universal<br/>standard. The nature of quintal/quartal musics in many world<br/>traditions, including European and related musics both of the medieval<br/>era and of the 20th century, do not quite get perceived as equally<br/>&quot;natural.&quot;</p><p>Since Pythagorean (3-limit) tuning is in fact one of the oldest and<br/>most widespread JI systems in the world, and possibly the one such<br/>system with a significant historical practice on keyboards, one might<br/>expect JI advocacy to include this as well as other systems. Yasser&apos;s<br/>writings (although often focused on other kinds of tunings) show how<br/>such a JI approach might put the familiar 5-limit into perspective<br/>vis-a-vis both 3-limit and 7-limit or higher.</p><p>Unfortunately, such approaches do not always prevail. Medieval<br/>polyphony remains a relatively obscure area, and the unstable musical<br/>treatment of thirds (at whatever tuning) tends to be seen still as a<br/>kind of curiosity, if not a flaw. In contrast, I have rarely seen<br/>people propose here that Renaissance music was unusual because it<br/>didn&apos;t use concordant sonorities with minor sevenths, or that<br/>Zarlino&apos;s vocal tuning must have been purely theoretical because real<br/>singers couldn&apos;t resist those just 7:4&apos;s.</p><p>All this being said, I would like again to applaud the kind of<br/>empirical analysis of vocal intonation now being conducted and<br/>discussed on this Tuning List -- indeed a worthy tribute to<br/>Aristoxenes.</p><p>To place the results in perspective, I would like again to emphasize<br/>the distinction between keyboard and vocal intonations. How close<br/>singers may actually come to Pythagorean intonation (especially<br/>without the influence of a Pythagorean keyboard or similar instrument)<br/>is an interesting question, and traditional theories may be vindicated<br/>or modified depending on the results. Of course, these results should<br/>ideally reflect various performances of medieval plainsong and<br/>polyphony, in a range of acoustical settings.</p><p>However, just as I suspect that Ed Foote would not base his advocacy<br/>of Baroque-Romantic well-temperaments on the assumption that<br/>unaccompanied singers of 18th-19th century music actually approximate<br/>a Werckmeister or Kirnberger, so those of us advocating Pythagorean<br/>keyboard tunings for medieval music need not be discouraged if<br/>vocalists tend to diverge from such tunings.</p><p>Just as the well-temperaments bring both utility and beauty to the<br/>music of their eras, so Pythagorean is at once practical and beautiful<br/>for playing medieval plainsong and polyphony. There are, of course,<br/>exceptions; some compositions of the well-tempered era might actually<br/>fare better with 12-tet (forgive me, Ed, and remember that I only said<br/>_might_), and some medieval English polyphony may do best with an<br/>approximation of 5-limit (how about a full 53-tet keyboard, for<br/>schisma thirds wherever desired and pure fifths?).</p><p>At any rate, discussing the &quot;intonational politics&quot; involved in<br/>medieval tuning issues may suggest how the emotions may be a bit more<br/>complex than when someone proposes doing Beethoven in 5-limit or<br/>7-limit JI, for example. If our dialogue ultimately serves to make<br/>Perotin or Machaut as familiar as Beethoven, then much of the<br/>potential tension may be defused.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>David J.
