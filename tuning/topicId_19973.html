A noteworthy quality about this sequence, as one can<br/>easily observe, is that each Odd Limit begins with an odd numerator<br/>Super-Particular Ratio, and with the final inversion of each Odd<br/>Limit, the sequence &quot;closes&quot; with an Even Numerator Super-Particular<br/>Ratio.</p><p>So in short, the Harmonic Series is a connecting thread, running<br/>through this sequence. Another interesting fact, is that all the<br/>ratios within each super-particular &quot;framed set&quot;, are also easily<br/>found by addition of successive members of the Harmonic Series.</p><p>It is a veritable paradise of JI flavors, for both melody and<br/>harmony. There are myriad of ways that one could subset from this,<br/>and I&apos;ll provide a couple of methods I&apos;ve found valuable from a<br/>melodic point of view and stylistic approach.</p><p>So let&apos;s look a four 13 tone scales derived from this sequence.<br/>Because the Harmonic Mirror scales are so relative to, and derivative<br/>of the harmonic series, it can be an interesting approach to just<br/>merely extract a series of scales in ascending order by odd limit,<br/>taking each functional interval from where it falls in the sequence.<br/>As one can see below, each of these scales has inversional symmetry<br/>at the tritone.</p><p>#1<br/>Ratio Cents Value<br/> 1/1     0<br/> 13/12   138.573<br/> 8/7     231.174<br/> 6/5     315.641<br/> 5/4     386.314<br/> 4/3     498.045<br/> 7/5     582.512<br/> 10/7    617.488<br/> 3/2     701.955<br/> 8/5     813.686<br/> 5/3     884.359<br/> 7/4     968.826<br/> 24/13   1061.427<br/> 2/1     1200.000</p><p>#2<br/>Ratio Cents Value<br/> 1/1       0<br/> 14/13     128.298<br/> 9/8       203.910<br/> 7/6       266.871<br/> 9/7       435.084<br/> 13/10     454.214<br/> 11/8      551.318<br/> 16/11     648.682<br/> 20/13     745.786<br/> 14/9      764.916<br/> 12/7      933.129<br/> 16/9      996.090<br/> 13/7      1071.702<br/> 2/1       1200.000</p><p>#3<br/>Ratio Cents Value<br/> 1/1        0<br/> 15/14    119.443<br/> 10/9     182.404<br/> 11/9     347.408<br/> 14/11    417.508<br/> 15/11    536.951<br/> 18/13    563.382<br/> 13/9     636.618<br/> 22/15    663.049<br/> 11/7     782.492<br/> 18/11    852.592<br/> 9/5      1017.596<br/> 28/15    1080.557<br/> 2/1      1200.000</p><p>#4<br/>Ratio Cents Value<br/> 1/1         0<br/> 16/15     111.731<br/> 11/10     165.004<br/> 13/11     289.210<br/> 16/13     359.472<br/> 17/13     464.428<br/> 24/17     597.000<br/> 17/12     603.000<br/> 26/17     735.572<br/> 13/8      840.528<br/> 22/13     910.790<br/> 20/11     1034.996<br/> 15/8      1088.269<br/> 2/1       1200.000</p><p>Number 4, is the scale for the flute I used on my Tuning Punks<br/>piece &quot;The Fourth Order&quot;. And that&apos;s a very simple demonstration of<br/>what I&apos;m speaking about, as far as my melodic approach to these<br/>tunings.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that one can extend this sequence very far, and still<br/>produce scales that sound compatible with a harmonic drone - I have<br/>explored ratios up to 37. As above, there are many ways to subset<br/>from the sequence, and I have worked with large scale structures too,<br/>even have for years explored tunings where I have a different tuning<br/>in each octave, mapped across the midi range, so I have this morphing<br/>tuning happening as I play.</p><p>The detailing of all the subset methods, and variations on the theme<br/>would be extremely bulky to present here, but I hope this little<br/>window into this harmonic tuning approach may inspire independent<br/>investigations. As always, feel free to &quot;Steal this Scale&quot; (remember<br/>Hoffman&apos;s funny &quot;Steal this Book&quot;?), and please let me know what you<br/>think. These may fail the &quot;lattice test&quot; but perhaps the success that<br/>one will find in using them melodically over a harmonic drone, will<br/>show the truth that &quot;Man cannot live on Lattice Alone&quot;. And we still<br/>are without solid theory about melodic concerns, which can be applied<br/>to any musical scenario. Still the final &quot;proofs&quot; for melodic theory<br/>are those that live manifest in actual music.</p><p>One microtonalist I asked about the Harmonic Mirror sequence, told me<br/>that there are many ways to create similar &quot;framing set&quot; sequences<br/>like this without using the harmonic series at all. I hope to be<br/>taken under his guidance to learn what this might be, but I have also<br/>worked with a Phi weighted version of this sequence as well, which<br/>likely qualifies.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=19974 href="#19974">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2001 8:00:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p>Hi Jacky,  you wrote:</p><p>&quot;The scales I derive from the Harmonic Mirror are intended to be used<br/>melodically over a harmonic drone.&quot;</p><p>I got interested because of the words &apos;melodically&apos; and &apos;drone&apos;.<br/>I am trying to see if it has any relevance to Indian music.

Can<br/>you<br/>&gt; elaborate [so that an Indian musician with no background in Tuning<br/>&gt; and temperament, can follow]?  What is a harmonic drone?</p><p>Haresh,</p><p>Hello!  Actually &quot;harmonic drones&quot;, and the use of them in my music,<br/>has an important parallel to the use of the Tanpura in Indian music.<br/>The tanpura, is probably one of the most important models for my<br/>purposes, and when I speak of &quot;harmonic drones&quot;, it is really a<br/>personal metaphor for the function that the tanpura serves in Indian<br/>Classical music.</p><p>If you have the ability to play MP3 files, you may be interested to<br/>hear an example of a harmonic drone that I spoke of during our thread<br/>about Meditation and Music. Here&apos;s the URL to our files section where<br/>I have a 35 second long harmonic drone (552 KB) in the key of<br/>Concert &quot;E&quot;:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/Ligon%20FFT/">/tuning/files/Ligon%20FFT/</a></p><p>This is an attempt to create a sound that will serve a function<br/>similar to that of the tanpura. The challenge with such electronic<br/>sound design, is to create a drone with a pleasant sound, that one<br/>can easily enjoy hearing for long periods of melodic improvisation.<br/>As Alison pointed out, it is movement in the harmonics that makes it<br/>work, and this is something that the tanpura does in a wonderfully<br/>natural way. If I had never heard the tanpura in Indian music, I feel<br/>certain I would not have been able to conceive of this. Thanks India!</p><p>Something I failed to mention last evening, is that if anyone who<br/>wishes to try out the scales, and is in need of a drone, you may play<br/>these scales with the drone here, to see the phenomenon<br/>of &apos;compatibility with the harmonic series&apos; I mentioned.  Of course,<br/>it may become necessary to transpose either the drone to another<br/>desired key center, or else make your tuning in concert &quot;E&quot;.</p><p>I believe that you will have superior results of beauty, if you do in<br/>fact use a real tanpura with the scales I posted. As I mentioned in<br/>the post, I&apos;ve found that even with the extended scales, which at the<br/>point where I stopped at ratios of 37, still sound correct over the<br/>drone, and inspire melodic possibilities.</p><p>&gt; If this is<br/>&gt; too irritatingly elementary for the group, you may reply through an<br/>&gt; email (I am not familiar with any of such conventions).</p><p>No question is too elementary, and I have many to ask about the<br/>practices of Indian music.  As above, the convention of the tanpura<br/>stands as a great model to me, for using drones and melodies.</p><p>&gt; I know I have yet to reply to some of your queries.  Later,<br/>&gt; definitely.</p><p>Looking forward to this, and take you time.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks.

I should say that going in to this<br/>&gt; I am a little bit skeptical of this whole symmetry thing<br/>&gt; as a theory.</p><p>Jeff,</p><p>Good Morning! Yes, and from a theoretical point of view, which may<br/>seek consonance in complex chords, this approach would invite healthy<br/>skepticism, but I&apos;ve found that the inversional symmetry at the 4th<br/>(modal), or the tritone, has incredible melodic power and<br/>possibilities. It&apos;s a virtue that the intervals are mirrored above,<br/>and lends a unique &quot;evenness&quot; to a melodic line over a drone. Usually<br/>I do not play chords at all with these scales, but harmony results<br/>when many different timbres are playing melodically with them<br/>(sometimes several scales at once are used!). One can make very<br/>complex tunings work in a musical texture with clever timbral and<br/>intervallic partitioning techniques.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; First I viewed the scales graphically and found them quite<br/>&gt; beautiful and intriguing to look it. I found my eyes<br/>&gt; moving from line to line, examining the spacing and the<br/>&gt; symmetry. Interesting indeed. Intriguing. But how would<br/>&gt; they sound?</p><p>That you ask this question, inspires me that I&apos;ve found a kindred<br/>spirit!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tuning #1:  Ho hum. Yeah OK. It&apos;s probably just me but I<br/>&gt; just do not get excited over overly consonant scales.</p><p>I must admit that they become more interesting for me too, when<br/>derived from the more complex members of the higher primes. That<br/>first one is a little &quot;conservative&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tuning #4: Holy Cow!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes tuning #4 is really something. It is totally<br/>&gt; astonishing. And I do not get too excited about most<br/>&gt; new tuning ideas.</p><p>Yes, things start getting sweet around that area of the harmonic<br/>mirror sequence. There is some great melodic tension that inspires me<br/>with the inclusion of more &apos;exotic&apos; thirds, and the alternate fourths<br/>and fifths that become available.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t play it over the drone. I&apos;m bad. I just<br/>&gt; tuned a piano with it and stamped it up and down<br/>&gt; in octave repetition.</p><p>That still qualifies as a harmonic drone!  You know, when I improvise<br/>with these scales, without using a drone, I still get some sense of<br/>there being an implied drone by virtue of the harmonic derivation of<br/>the pitches.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s something about these degrees:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/13,24/17,17/12,26/17</p><p>I would agree, and I really like the melodic energy of the 17/13, and<br/>26/17 altered fourths and fifths - that 736 cents fifth is wonderful.</p><p>Unfortunately, when I woke up this morning, I found a severed<br/>Chocolate Bunny Head in my bed with an accompanying note from Pat and<br/>David, reminding me of their recent copyright of 17. So I must be<br/>cautious about spreading undue &quot;Seventeenness&quot; around. Sorry about<br/>that fellers!  :  )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; First that 24/17,17/12  in the middle there is<br/>&gt; just plain silly but I gotta admit it works.</p><p>I remember David Beardsley had something such as this in a recent<br/>piece, but can&apos;t recall the intervals.  I do enjoy the melodic<br/>possibilities of extremely small commas, and where one may be using a<br/>mode from this scale which omits the fourth, having the two tritones,<br/>becomes a very nice thing.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I greatly enjoyed the shimmering effects I got from<br/>&gt; those close scale degrees &amp; their interactions with other<br/>&gt; notes in tunings #2 and #3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that 26/17 interval is pretty darn neat.<br/>&gt; It does something to me.<br/>&gt; And I started moving around, playing.<br/>&gt; And I was getting all overcome with these weird feelings.<br/>&gt; And I actually started crying.<br/>&gt; And I thought, now this is really something what is going<br/>&gt; on here? These beat patterns have got ahold of me and are<br/>&gt; wrenching me around this way and that and I feel like I am<br/>&gt; floating or something or just what is going on anyway.</p><p>It has a similar emotional effect on me, especially after I go into a<br/>long improv of about a half an hour or so. After I have internalized<br/>the tuning and my hands are warm, and I&apos;m in the &quot;Zone&quot;, the essence<br/>of the tuning just channels right through, and my hands gravitate to<br/>its unique internal qualities.</p><p>I think it noteworthy to point out, that I&apos;ve found allot of common<br/>ground with Margo Schulter in regard to her use of such &quot;wide&quot;<br/>intervals in her Neo Gothic music practice.  There is something so<br/>energetic, and &quot;Gamelan-Like&quot; about an interval like 26/17.</p><p>Isn&apos;t it a great wonder and blissful mystery how we may harness these<br/>beautiful musical effects for the emotional power that is latent in<br/>their structures? I just love this! I like to point out that we are<br/>but clever incidental organizers of phenomenon of nature, and the<br/>wonderful emotional power of microtonal tunings is something that we<br/>only assemble into desired structures, but the reasons why it works<br/>and has the emotive power it does, is outside our control. The<br/>tuning, rhythm and melody, all represent the most atomic level<br/>aspects of music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I stopped and I felt totally overwhelmed -- like I had<br/>&gt; been through some incredibly intense emotional experience<br/>&gt; that changes your life but I can&apos;t quite say what it was.</p><p>I do know exactly what you mean, and as above, I love to do long<br/>improvisations over drones - a highly meditative practice and<br/>experience. Even though I really enjoy complex tunings, I will always<br/>hold special interest for the other extreme of simplicities. There is<br/>something to be said for intimate musics, where a single instrument<br/>explores the possibilities of a melodic tuning in a very naked way.<br/>It can touch deeply.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kind of like a weird dimension of euphoria or something?</p><p>Definitely euphoric for me too.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So that&apos;s it for tuning #4 so far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll take a look again at tunings #2 and #3 again later<br/>&gt; but it seems on first listening to me that the general<br/>&gt; trend is that the tunings progress upwards in terms of<br/>&gt; profundity and depth and dimensionality.</p><p>A very interesting statement, and I agree, that as one ascends up<br/>this series, the treasures found become more and more wonderful.  If<br/>it pleases folks, and there is further interest, I will be happy to<br/>post some more about this, in small installments. This is something<br/>I&apos;ve used for a very long time, so there&apos;s lots more there.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; All tripped out and stuff, man. Freaking way to go, Jacky!<br/>&gt; You the man!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>Thanks so much Jeff, and I really wish I could have been there when<br/>you were playing the scales. I love to listen to folks improvise on<br/>them - and a curious note is that there have been times when I have<br/>let non-microtonalists improvise on these scales when they come to<br/>visit, and it was interesting to note how they tended to gravitate<br/>toward similar attributes of the scales that I find in them too. To<br/>watch them discover the melodic value of small intervals was a treat.</p><p>Is there perhaps some kind of archetypal interpretation possible with<br/>scales? Makes me wonder if many others would also tend to gravitate<br/>toward these qualities in a scale - either experienced with<br/>microtonality or not. I like to fancy that there are universals at<br/>work, although I&apos;m sure it would be difficult to pin down in the lab.</p><p>I have pondered too, that we may enjoy these sounds because they are<br/>so exotically different from the sounds of 12 tET, and perhaps we<br/>gravitate toward the unique melodic qualities which immediately give<br/>us pleasing and different flavors.</p><p>In gratitude,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
