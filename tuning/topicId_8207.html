A plea to performers to make runs as smooth as &#xFFFD;l will still not<br/>erase the basic unevenness of his meantone chromatic scale and classical<br/>fingerings (aside from still-limited use of the thumb, the two small fingers<br/>were limited to the lower (white) keys).</p><p> I had intended to leave my disagreement with Paul Erlich as an agreement to<br/>disagree, but having the opportunity to sit down between a fortepiano (in<br/>MT) and a harpsichord (in Kirn. III) today, I managed to reconvince myself.<br/>Not only was the contrast in rhetorical styles found in Bach and in<br/>Haydy/Mozart striking, but the way the temperament at hand reinforced the<br/>rhetoric was at times overwhelming.</p><p>The Viennese classicists simply do not use the continuous motoric found in<br/>Bach (Kagel&apos;s &quot;St. Bach Passion&quot; makes great fun of this), and their<br/>harmonic language does not presuppose, as Bach&apos;s always does, free<br/>modulation to twelve tonics where g# is equivalent to ab. Instead, even in<br/>their dance music, the metric continuity is always being shifted or<br/>interrupted, broken up into the smallest meaningful gestures, the field of<br/>harmonic possibilities, like meantone, is open ended (although Mozart<br/>parodies this in works like the _Fantasie_ K. 475, which deliberately moves<br/>through the most radical and barely plausible modulations) and the way in<br/>which chordal, diatonic, and chromatic materials are contrasted with and<br/>nestled among one another to create characteristic topoi, is largely<br/>dependent upon the fact that the chords and scales are uneven creatures.</p><p>Most convincing to me was the way in which Contrapunctus V from _The Art of<br/>the Fugue_ just fell apart in meantone on the fortepiano, while the bits of<br/>fugetta in the Rondo K. 494 completely lost their sense expansiveness when<br/>played in well temperament.  For a moment, I think I really understood why<br/>the fugal tradition did not survive Bach except as a passing topos, but at<br/>the same time how this was not a tragedy in that a alternative compositional<br/>function (the Sonata) was developed where one could make convincing tonal<br/>closure although the tone system itself was not closed.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt am Main</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Paul H.

My<br/>source on the &quot;until Beethovan&quot; part was me.
