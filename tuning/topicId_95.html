 Mandelbrot noise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;FORMULA ARROW TEMPERAMENTS, OCTOPHONIC MANDELBROT NOISE:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hello fellow retuners!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I am thinking of using the &quot;Mandelbrot set&quot; in a 19ET AI composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I want to mak what I call &quot;Mandelbrot noise&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What type of software do you think I should use?<br/>&gt;I need something that can do imaginary and complex numbers and also additive<br/>&gt;sytnthesis, changing over time continuously.<br/>&gt;This is very like &quot;granular synthesis&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Something with a fine color resolution, and a fine sound resolotion.<br/>&gt;Mabey Mandelbrot noise would sound like chaotic brownian noise changing over<br/>&gt;time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The fractint program isn&apos;t what I thought it would be-it doosen&apos;t do powers<br/>&gt;of powers of powers for complex numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I was thinking of doing an &quot;16ophonic&quot; (or 6D-quadruple steryocube) AI<br/>&gt;Mandelbrot noise composition in 19ET/19 Quiggle/19 revers quiggle<br/>&gt;temperament- each temperament division in 19ET a timbre based on a<br/>&gt;Mandelbrot set of the form z--&gt;z^((2^(1/19))^n).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This would probably run for 70 seconds, with that amount of information.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Get a computer to emulate a recording in 16 points in 3D space, or 16<br/>&gt;pointsin 4D space.<br/>&gt;How could I make it so people with a 16 speaker system would hear<br/>&gt;16ophonics, people with an 8 speaker system would hear octophonic, people<br/>&gt;with a quadrophonic system would hear quadrophonic, people with a steryo<br/>&gt;system would hear steryo?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I feel that part of the composition on any CD should be its position in the<br/>&gt;steryo field-all part of the artistic package.<br/>&gt;I would also like to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1.Graph a 3 dimensional version of the Mandelbrot set.<br/>&gt;By this, I DO NOT mean, a standard Mandelbrot set with the colors raised in<br/>&gt;a surface, but an actual Mandelbrot solid, embedded in 3 space.<br/>&gt;The 3rd dimension could be the Logarithm of a negative number, or what I<br/>&gt;term an &quot;L&quot; number, a real, an imaginary, or a hypercomplex number.<br/>&gt;It would be good to define a view point of the 3D Mandelbrot with some of<br/>&gt;its outside shell shaved away, or with a reverse color spectrum , fly around<br/>&gt;it and into it, rotate it by the xy, xz, yz axis, take 2 dimensional slices<br/>&gt;of it.<br/>&gt;I would also like the capabilitys to graph different mathematical formulae,<br/>&gt;Could you calculate the curve length, magnitude and slope of the iterated<br/>&gt;complex formula, and also the surface area of the 3D Mandelbrot set solids<br/>&gt;plane, (ie.the surface made by slices of the Mandelbrot Set solid, with<br/>&gt;color=height).<br/>&gt;I would like to be able to use different colored light sources/shadows on the<br/>&gt;Mandelbrot set, treat it as a mirror, and make it transparent/opaque.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;2.Treat the Mandelbrot Set as a matrix, with position on complex plane= rows<br/>&gt;and columns, color =matrix value, and multitply it, and geometrically<br/>&gt;average it, add and average the diagnols from each square, treat the matrix<br/>&gt;as power of power of powers in a spiral fashion and average it using<br/>&gt;...(x^(x^(x^)))&apos;s equivalent root.<br/>&gt;Iterate the values of these numbers in the complex plane ect...<br/>&gt;We could let each color value stand for a binary matrix, and then alter it,<br/>&gt;or use imaginary, negative and real numbers to be added.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;3.Overlayer 2 different Mandelbrot set formulae, say z-&gt;z^2+c and<br/>&gt;z-&gt;z^3-(1/c) via 10000 frames of time, and blend/average the pixels color<br/>&gt;with respect to time.<br/>&gt;This could be done for ipeg images of cartoons, plants at various stages of<br/>&gt;growth, waveforms at various stages of time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;4.Handle really big numbers and their roots, and also operater like &quot;power<br/>&gt;of power of powers of powers...) and its equivalent root.<br/>&gt;Ie.(....(x^(x^(^x(x^x))))=x&amp;c, and ((((x^x)^x)^x)^x)....=x&amp;.c<br/>&gt;Is there a specific notation for these?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://5.Is">5.Is</a> there a software package that can handle my &quot;arrow notation&quot;:<br/>&gt;x+y=x(1 up arrow)y,<br/>&gt;x*y=x(2 up arrow)y,<br/>&gt;x^y=x(3 up arrow)y,<br/>&gt;x&amp;y=x(4 up arrow)y....ect...<br/>&gt;(What would negative, imaginary, complex, L arrows be?2.5 arrows?Equivalent<br/>&gt;root values?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;6.Does I need a software package that has the ability to animate, and change<br/>&gt;color in 4D and 5D, do calculus, quartonians, octonians ect?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;7.Create a fractal acoustically modeled instrument, like a &quot;tree branch<br/>&gt;trumpet&quot; , or an instrument produceing FFT fractal noise.(What about making<br/>&gt;an acoustically modeled intrument from Mandelbrot Noise?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://8.Do">8.Do</a> fractal cellular automa, and ants on the Mandelbrot set (Cellular<br/>&gt;automa--&gt;computer scans each sqares sourronding squares colors, giving each<br/>&gt;color a score and totaling it.<br/>&gt;Depending on the score, it subtracts a certain value from the central<br/>&gt;squares score, thus changing its color.<br/>&gt;Ants---&gt;Computer scans each square one at a time.<br/>&gt;Depending on their color, the square heads 90 degrees anti-clockwise one<br/>&gt;square, or 90 degrees clock wise one square.<br/>&gt;Depending on the square it lands on, it will change its direction.<br/>&gt;In addition to this, it changes the squares color it has left from.<br/>&gt;If two or more squares land in the same place, the square effects all their<br/>&gt;movement.<br/>&gt;We could even graph color square landed on vs color square changes to vs<br/>&gt;color that moving square changes to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;9.Acoustically model the Mandelbrot set.(This would be really interesting).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;11.Define a number that is the &quot;Quiggles equiivalent root&quot; of -1.<br/>&gt;IS there such a number?What about quiggle roots of i, -i, L, -L, iL, -iL.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;10.Define logs or L numbers eg log(10L)=L(2), log(10(2L))=L(3), and also<br/>&gt;(-1)quiggle roots as &quot;Q&quot; numbers ect....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;13.Define a class of numbers with different propoerty for addition,<br/>&gt;multiplication, powers, quiggles ect....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;11.I realise that you can join a line of existing photographs into a strip<br/>&gt;to make a panoramic image.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;12.Panoramic images have been done before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;13.Use the Mandelbrot set as a time stretch/up sample jelly (jello to you<br/>&gt;Americans!) algorithm.<br/>&gt;Real=time, imaginary=time stretch/compress, color=up sample/down sample.<br/>&gt;We could use combinations of the above axis, imaginry=time, color time<br/>&gt;stretch/compress, color=up/down sample.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Has this ever been done for a full sphere, in all x, y, z axis?<br/>&gt;It would be difficult to control by hand, of course!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Microphones are, by default, quasi-sphereical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Obviously, the smaller the photographs (down to pixel size), the less<br/>&gt;distorted the end result will be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Its impossible to map/squash a hollow sphere down onto a flat surface<br/>&gt;without distortion.<br/>&gt;We could do it by mathematical manipulation, however.<br/>&gt;What is the algortihm used to do this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Failing this, could we take 6 square photographs, and alter them<br/>&gt;mathematically by averageing/blending formulae to generate squares into --&gt;<br/>&gt;spheres?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What about &quot;sphereical real time&quot;, looking in on an image from all<br/>&gt;directions? photography, also known as &quot;time slice&quot; photography.<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve seen it done as a strip, but not a movie.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(This would probably be impossible, as the other cameras would get caught in<br/>&gt;a video-feedback loop, unless they were viewed from a great distance.<br/>&gt;Perhaps you could use 8 video camers with a suitably wide view field/cone,<br/>&gt;and blend the images by computer).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The same would apply to realtime panoramic photography, unless the<br/>&gt;photographer was concealed, between takes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What would a realtime sphereical panoramic, and/or time-slice viedolook like.<br/>&gt;Using bigger focal lengths, zoom lenses, we could magnify the images also,<br/>&gt;without loss of resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What about taking a time slice video of a head from all directions,<br/>&gt;ie.looking in from a sphere, and morphing squares from the frames into an<br/>&gt;&quot;unraveled head&quot; in realtime, or steptime video.<br/>&gt;We could pull faces, turn around ect.<br/>&gt;Use a different color filter for each image.<br/>&gt;We could have an inverse panoramic image of the 3D Mandelbrot set solid&apos;s<br/>&gt;surface, flattened on a plane, being  magnified.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;13.What would the effect be of taking slices of a moving picture footage,<br/>&gt;and averageing the pixels colors (0-1000 on a ROYGBIV spectrum, or RGB color<br/>&gt;scale) via time (eg (pc(1)+pc(2))/t(2)-t(1)=pc(3) at t(3), where pc=pixel<br/>&gt;color value, t=time.<br/>&gt;We could take the geometrical and harmonic averages, the slopes of the color<br/>&gt;gradually changing via time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This would be interesting when combined with panoramic images or &quot;time<br/>&gt;slice&quot; in 3D.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What about a combination of the above ideas in steryoscopic vision?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A mathematical formula to alter the color of the graph, eg pc(n)=sin(pc)n.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;14.What fasinates me is the relationship between graphical effects and<br/>&gt;acoustic effects.<br/>&gt;Could we harmonically analyse a sample for its relevance to the temperament<br/>&gt;were playing in, and give it a &quot;beauty score&quot; for that temperament?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Finally, if you want to talk about my &quot;arrow synthesis&quot;, and mathematical<br/>&gt;formula snake temperaments, let me know!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Any ideas?<br/>&gt;I look foward to hearing from you,<br/>&gt;Food for thought,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Happy new year,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sarn Ursell.<br/>&gt;<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;
