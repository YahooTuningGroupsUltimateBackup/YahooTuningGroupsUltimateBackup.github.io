Cool! I&apos;d bet Bach would fall in-between Schubert and, say,<br/>Byrd, in this regard.</p><p>&gt;Just listened to the Bach/Busoni in COFT and it&apos;s really lovely!</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s up on my web site, at</p><p>&gt;   <a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p><p>At 2:45, where I thought I heard the quartertone before, I thought I heard a<br/>shift again. You&apos;ve trained me well! Of course, after I listened to it<br/>again, it became clear that there was no shift, the harmony is just funny<br/>there (some kind of suspended leading tone there).</p><p>&gt;&gt;F-C tempered by about 4/10 comma!<br/>&gt;   I calculate .41 comma<br/>Yup.</p><p>&gt;&gt;E-B tempered by almost 1/2 comma !!!<br/>&gt;   I calculate .41 comma</p><p>The difference of the deviations is</p><p>0.4689&#xFFFD;-(-7.2912&#xFFFD;) = 7.7601&#xFFFD;</p><p>700&#xFFFD;-7.7601&#xFFFD; = 692.2399&#xFFFD;</p><p>That&apos;s 9.7151&#xFFFD; flat, or .45 comma.</p><p>&gt;&gt;B-F# tempered by about 3/10 comma<br/>&gt;   I calculate .31 comma<br/>Yup.</p><p>I found this performance very beautiful -- listening to it in &quot;background<br/>mode&quot;, none of these three over-tempered fifths/fourths called attention to<br/>themselves. They must only occur in pretty fast passages, yes? Anyway, what<br/>seems to be the case is the vast majority of fifths/fourths in the piece are<br/>those in the i, iv, and v (V) triads of the key, occurring in relative<br/>proportions 3:1:2. The fifths/fourths of the VII and especially III are<br/>almost entirely absent, while that of the VI occurs about 1/5 as much as<br/>that of i. This accounts for the great degree of justness given to the<br/>frequently occuring fifths, and the over-temperament of the other ones<br/>(needed to get the common thirds in tune). So the optimal tuning you found<br/>is super for D minor (I presume E-B and B-F# are over-tempered in order to<br/>get the leading tone and the parallel major third in tune), but would flop<br/>miserably for a piece in the relative, F major. Has anyone seen a tuning<br/>like this before?</p></div>
