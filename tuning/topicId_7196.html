I don&apos;t mean to be so far &quot;behind the<br/>&gt;curve,&quot; but  if you have time could someone explain a bit more fully what<br/>&gt;&quot;adaptive&quot; JI is?? (Ratio and pitch examples might help, too.)  I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;seem to find that term here in my Doty JI primer which is, unfortunately,<br/>&gt;about the limit of my limits. Thanks!</p><p>OK, Joe. Let&apos;s take the progression I-IV-ii-V-I with common tones wherever<br/>possible. In JI (strict _or_ adaptive), a major triad is is 4:5:6 and a<br/>minor triad is 1/6:1/5:1/4. So that determines the vertical constitution of<br/>the chords. But their horizontal relationship is not so straighforward. A<br/>Doty-style JI advocate might render the progression as follows:</p><p>ratios:</p><p>     1/1----------1/1         10/9----x-----9/8          5/4<br/>     3/2          5/3----------5/3          3/2----------3/2<br/>     5/4          4/3         10/9         15/8          2/1<br/>     1/1          4/3----------4/3          3/2          1/1<br/>      I            IV           ii           V            I</p><p>cents:</p><p>           0-----------0         182----x----204         386<br/>         702         884---------884         702---------702<br/>         386         498         182        1088        1200<br/>           0         498---------498         702           0<br/>          I           IV          ii          V           I</p><p>while a JI rendition that observes common tones would go:</p><p>ratios:</p><p>     1/1----------1/1         10/9---------10/9        100/81<br/>     3/2          5/3----------5/3         40/27--------40/27<br/>     5/4          4/3         10/9         50/27       160/81<br/>     1/1          4/3----------4/3         40/27        80/81<br/>      I            IV           ii           V            I</p><p>cents:</p><p>      0------------0          182----------182          365<br/>    702          884----------884          680----------680<br/>    386          498          182         1067         1178<br/>      0          498----------498          680          -22<br/>     I            IV           ii           V            I</p><p>The first rendition is problematic because the shift of a full comma from<br/>10/9 to 9/8 (from 182 to 204 cents) is large enough to sound like a<br/>performer uncertainty in melodic intonation, particularly when the motivic<br/>structure of the piece calls for an exact repetition and when the voice in<br/>question is the soprano. The second rendition is problematic because if it<br/>repeats enough times during the course of a piece, the &quot;I&quot; will drift so far<br/>from the original &quot;I&quot; (one comma per repetition) that you lose the sense of<br/>&quot;home key&quot;.</p><p>The adaptive tuning solution that Vicentino would have chosen using his<br/>second tuning of 1555, and that I&apos;ve been trying to pitch to John<br/>deLaubenfels, involves tuning the roots horizontally in meantone temperament<br/>while maintaining the same vertical proportions as JI. While no longer<br/>expressible in ratios, the progression becomes (in cents):</p><p>      0-----.------5.5        193----.-----198.5        386<br/>    702          889.5---.----895          696.5---.----702<br/>    386          503.5        195         1083.5       1200<br/>      0          503.5---.----509          696.5          0<br/>     I            IV           ii           V            I</p><p>Here every common tone undergoes a shift of only 1/4-comma, an interval too<br/>small to hear melodically. Meanwhile, there is no overall drift; the &quot;I&quot;<br/>remains where it started. Essentially, one has distributed the comma<br/>shift/drift equally over the four chord changes. Remember, each chord, in<br/>itself, is in the same JI simple-integer proportions as before, so harmonic<br/>consonance is not sacrificed at all.</p></div><h3><a id=7205 href="#7205">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/1999 8:55:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In TD453.24 &quot;Paul H.

Dave, you may not have been following this discussion very closely,<br/>but what I&apos;ve been telling Joseph is that this latter trick is an important<br/>feature of Schubert&apos;s music (though rare in composers before Schubert), and<br/>that Schubert&apos;s music would therefore require greater sacrifices to put it<br/>in adaptive JI:</p><p>&gt;These shift you by about 40 or 60 cents per iteration (much worse than<br/>comma pumps).
