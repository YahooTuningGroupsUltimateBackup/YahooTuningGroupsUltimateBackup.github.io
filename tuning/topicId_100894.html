Time and the undefined range of the octave are deleting his declaration.</p><p>I trust to the Progression of Musical Cells, a set of 624 cell frequencies within the range 1 up to (9/8)^6 = 2.02728652954, I derived in the past century. To do a clear explanation I copy here its final 15 cells:</p><p>The first column gives the commas J = 1.001131371103, M = 1.00112915039. The third column gives the cell frequency. The third comma of groups JMM, MMJ used along the progression signaled all the tones of Pythagoras and JI extended scales so cell # 612 is signaled by M that is the third comma of the group J M M. Who derived the 2 octave? Nobody knows that. It is a natural parameter, and all natural parameters like the gravity acceleration constant are not given by round numbers.  Cell # 615, the third cell of group MMJ was the suspected value of the true octave, some reasoning and calculations confimed it.</p><p>&lt;Unfortunately, I&apos;m not reading any words that show me why this octave is the true one. I don&apos;t know why you think it sounds better, or how it was derived, or what you want to do with it.&gt;</p><p>Should you study the attached files, I filed a few days ago, you will read about this subject and know how it was derived. I think it sounds better because that is what I perceive. I don&acute;t know what can I do with it.</p><p>You can complete the explanation by reading the attached file, feel free to ask some additional information you need.

The rules of string mechanical vibrations depend on uniform density strings, acceptable elasticity, not a gram of weight.....If these conditions are satisfied then the Mechanics Chapter of Physics rules the inverse relation between lenght and vibration frequency.</p><p>-- The Acoustic Chapter of Physics rules the sound. No density, no elasticity, no weight. It is unquestionable that one rule that governs the string vibrations cannot govern any type of sound processes like its frequency.<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>IMPORTANT:</p><p>About the piano used to record Brahms piece and chords:<br/>There is a 99.99 % of probability that the piano is far to be tuned to toctave tuning because :</p><p>-- Even in the case that you used file # 3 (THE PIANO TUNED TO THE TRUE OCTAVE), where the middle A frequency equals 440 Hz, the resulted tuning probably is not the toctave tuning. Here in Lima, the tuner also made adjustments to compensate the imperfection of the ear.

Railsback, expresses the difference between normal piano tuning and an equal-tempered scale (one in which the frequencies of successive notes are related by a constant ratio, equal to the twelfth root of two). For any given note on the piano, the deviation between the normal pitch of that note and its equal-tempered pitch is given in cents (hundredths of a semitone).</p><p>  As the Railsback curve shows, octaves are normally stretched on a well-tuned piano. That is, the high notes are higher, and the low notes lower, than they are in an equal-tempered scale. Not all octaves are equally stretched: the middle octaves are barely stretched at all, whereas the octaves on either end of the piano are stretched considerably.</p><p>  Railsback discovered that pianos were typically tuned in this manner not because of a lack of precision, but because of inharmonicity in the strings. Ideally, the overtone series of a note consists of frequencies that are integer multiples of the note&apos;s fundamental frequency. Inharmonicity causes the successive overtones to be higher than they &quot;should&quot; be.</p><p>    At low frequencies, the tuner has to make a gradual frequency deduction in order to get &quot;ear octaves&quot; with respect to keys with higher than 440 Hz.</p><p>  Are you saying that the frequencies are ignored and the piano ends up being tuned by ear??<br/>  ONCE YOU COMPLETE THE TOCTAVE TUNING WITH THOSE FREQUENCIES YOU CAN DO THE CORRECTIONS THIS<br/>  WAY YOU HAVE GOOD REFERENCES TO SHAPE A SIMILAR CURVE. THE EAR OCTAVES PROBABLY WON&acute;T REQUIRE MUCH ADDERS TO SHAPE BOTH SIDES OF THE CURVE. THE MIDDLE OCTAVE CONTAINING THE TOCTAVE FREQUENCIES GIVEN BY FILE # 3 SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED.<br/>  THE WHOLE 88 KEYS COMPRISES 8742.521 CENTS BEFORE THE CORRECTIONS.

Summary:</p><p>* With only 12 tones/oct, temperament is useless in the<br/>13-limit, and ideal tunings are made of superposed harmonic<br/>series segments, such as those due to George Secor and<br/>David Canright.</p><p>* In the 7-limit, rank-3 temperament is possible by<br/>treating 225:224 as a unison, where scales by Wilson, Hahn,<br/>myself, and Dave Keenan come to the fore.  However, giving<br/>up a few tetrads to get more 3:2s is sometimes preferred,<br/>and here all roads seem to point to Kraig Grady&apos;s &quot;centaur&quot;<br/>scale (very similar to Other Music&apos;s 12-tone scale and<br/>independently discovered by myself).</p><p>* 7-limit rank-2 and equal temperament points to a flat<br/>octave (e.g. Dominant[12]).  As far as I know, I&apos;m the only<br/>person to tune real pianos with flat-octave tunings.<br/>There happens to be one with synchronous-beating trines<br/>(power chords) and an octave very near Gene&apos;s zeta octave.<br/>I&apos;ve also come up with a series of flat-octave well<br/>temperaments.  The stretch based on the timbre of the<br/>instrument can be added to the theoretical (flat) octave.</p><p>* 5-limit tuning starts with 12-tone Fokker blocks, and<br/>Gene has done a comprehensive survey of these.  Meantone<br/>quickly follows, with Paul Erlich&apos;s TOP meantone being<br/>optimal (and providing a tiny amount of endemic octave<br/>stretch).</p><p>* Further tempering leads to 1/5th- and 1/6th-comma<br/>well temperaments.  Among these, I&apos;ve studied the chains<br/>that avoid the most discordant major thirds.  There&apos;s also<br/>the possibility for &quot;rational well-tempered&quot; versions of<br/>these, and I&apos;ve algorithmically found the VRWT with the<br/>greatest number of 17-limit concordances.  RWTs also lead<br/>to triads with simple &quot;beat ratios&quot;, where Bob Wendell&apos;s<br/>&quot;natural synchronous well&quot; remains king.  However,<br/>investigations by myself and others showed that extended<br/>rationals and simple beat ratios provide little if any<br/>benefit in musical settings where well temperaments are<br/>typically used.</p><p>* For the 3-limit, equal divisions of 3:2 or 3:1 can be<br/>used, and will provide a modest amount of endemic stretch.</p><p>In the end, the following conclusions are reached:</p><p>- For Renaissance and early baroque music, TOP meantone<br/>is barely better than the quarter-comma tuning in common<br/>use since that time.</p><p>- For Baroque and early Classical music, slight improvement<br/>may be found by using one of my &apos;more equal&apos; 1/5th- or 1/6th-<br/>comma well temperaments.</p><p>- For 20th century Russian music, equal division of 3:1 or<br/>even 3:2 makes an interesting choice.</p><p>- For certain kinds of jazz (e.g. Oscar Peterson) or<br/>Romantic music (Brahms), a flat-octave equal or well<br/>temperament may provide modest benefit over 12-ET.</p><p>- For new music, certain 7-, 11- or 13-limit scales can be<br/>tried, though the Halberstadt keyboard is far from ideal<br/>for such purposes.</p><p>In all, very little advantage is to be found over common<br/>keyboard tuning &amp; practice.

It never mentions that dividing a string into 2 equal parts produces more than an octave or &quot;true octave&quot; as we are coming to know it. On the other hand, it states the obvious...that dividing a string below midway produces more than an octave or more than&nbsp;twice the frequency.

Here I will do a short abstract and hope you believe me. I took the requinto, made some little touchs to the tuning. As you know the conventional note E given by the first string of a tempered GUITAR is 329.6 Hz (open string) while it is 440 on the &quot;requinto&quot; that was the instrument I used in the experiment. You can also do it with the GUITAR I think.</p><p>Once the requinto was tuned, I softly plucked the 6th and 1st string alternately to get familiar with the E sound, then started to raise E note of the 6th string keeping pressed the 2d fret, 3d string to get A 220 Hz. Soft and alternate touchs on 6th and 3d string (E &amp; A) during the slow raising of E. Then a clear consonance appeared.

Furthermore, many instruments will exhibit slight inharmonicity such that their second harmonics are sharp as well. This is just an educated guess, but the tendency to prefer sharp octaves might reflect a tendency towards slightly sharp and inharmonic timbres in general. It may mean that not only do humans prefer sharp octaves, but generally prefer stretched timbres all around. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this were true in general.</p><p>  Either way, there&apos;s no point arguing over which one is the &quot;true&quot; octave. To deny that our perception of the octave has at least something to do with 2/1 would be unwise. It also makes no sense to pretend that mathematical ratios are inherently important without a stochastic human observer with a stochastic auditory system to perceive them.</p><p>  So this is a good opportunity to come to a greater understanding of the nonlinear relationship between phenomenal perception and noumenal reality. Well that sounds awfully intriguing! Kant would be thrilled. In comparison, to cop out of this whole thing now and just argue on which octave is &quot;truer&quot; than the other doesn&apos;t sound anywhere near as interesting. Actually, I&apos;d rather grab a cold beer and watch reruns of Ren and Stimpy instead of doing that.</p><p>  -Mike</p><p>  Sent from my iPhone</p><p>  On Jul 31, 2011, at 7:13 PM, Steve Parker &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    This is all getting a bit crazy..</p><p>    What Carillo (who used 16th tones and standard 24ET) states as a physical reality is known and understood.<br/>    If octaves are stretched then so are cents by definition!

HERE YOU HAVE A CLEAR EXPLANATION I THINK.<br/>MARIO</p><p>Aug. 02</p><p>     TOCTAVE FOUNDATION</p><p>     This article gives information regarding the derivation of the toctave, that is slightly higher than the 2 octave.<br/>     The last group of 18 cells of the progression ends on (9/8)^6 = 2.02728652954 containing the 2 octave<br/>     as well as other cells having close frequencies like 2.00678700656 = Cell # 615, called toctave. The whole<br/>     progression comprises 624 cells.</p><p>     The twelfth root of the toctave gives the semitone factor that determines the tone frequencies of an equal<br/>     tempered scale detailed below; more information is found in file # 1 which is available in folder<br/>     <a href="/tuning/files/MarioPizarro/">/tuning/files/MarioPizarro/</a></p><p>     The Progression is formed by 6 equal groups of cells, each containing 104 cells which comprises six<br/>     segments ordained as follows: QRQQRQ.</p><p>     Set Q comprises 18 cells while Set R works with 16 so (4 x 18) + (2 x 16) .= 104 cells are contained in any<br/>     of the 6 segments. Since the progression comprises 6 groups, the total number of cells equals 104 x 6 =<br/>     624 cells.</p><p>     Cell # 612 .= 2 is the octave of the equal tempered scale and is aligned to the third comma of group JMM.<br/>     If we analyze the commas distribution along the progression of cells, we can verify that most of them take<br/>     part in successive groups of M*M* J * J*M* M and that the third comma of either the group MMJ or JJM is<br/>     always aligned to one of the many classic cells that lie in the progression like 9/8, (9/8)^n, 2^(n/2), 3/2,<br/>     (4/3), (45/32), (15/8), (16/9), (27/16), 2, ...etc.</p><p>     The stretched octave should also be considered a classic cell so it is one of the three frequencies that lie<br/>     in Segment Q column shown in the table, which are signaled by cell frequencies # 609, # 612 and # 615<br/>     that are aligned to the third commas (J, M, J) given in the first column of table.</p><p>     In the period 1947 to 1967, Juli&iuml;&iquest;&half;n Carrillo has demonstrated  that the physical octave is not 2 but a slightly<br/>     higher than the 2 ratio.</p><p>     Therefore, the correct octave is given by cell # 615 = 2.00678700656 = 1205.865 cents</p><p>       Cell # SEGMENT Q SQ.
