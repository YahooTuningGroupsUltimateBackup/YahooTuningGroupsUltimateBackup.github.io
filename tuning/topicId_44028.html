But I can host it on my server<br/>pronto if somebody else wants to do the work.

If there is a lot of<br/>need for big multimedia files maybe this is not enough, but for text and<br/>cgi&apos;s it will last a long time.  (I have a &quot;virtual&quot; server with a 1GB limit<br/>currently.)  If you have domains out there that you want to make subdomains<br/>of, we can also point those subdomains to my server.  To clarify,<br/><a href="http://somedomain.com/subsite">somedomain.com/subsite</a> has to be on the same server as <a href="http://somedomain.com">somedomain.com</a>, but<br/><a href="http://subsite.somedomain.com">subsite.somedomain.com</a> can be on an entirely different server (e.g. mine).<br/>However the <a href="http://somedomain.com">somedomain.com</a> DNS host must set this up.</p><p>&gt; Although if they get big enough I can<br/>&gt; always upgrade the account.
