But, those can hardly be presented outside the context of the whole book, being built upon earlier theorems.  You&apos;ll be interested especially where he takes it in chapter 12.  Unfortunately, since he&apos;s concerned with keeping both the fifths and major thirds as nearly pure as possible, he doesn&apos;t spend enough time discussing the divisions that 18th century musicians cared most about; neither does Barbour.  Ah well.  But he does devote a good chunk of chapter 12 to 53edo.</p><p>And Friedrich Suppig&apos;s &quot;Calculus musicus&quot; of 1722 is about 19edo and 31edo, along with a pretty lousy piece &quot;Labyrinthus musicus&quot; (mostly a bunch of uninspired sequences, sounding like bad imitation Vivaldi).  Granted, when I&apos;ve played through it, it hasn&apos;t been in 19edo or 31edo yet; but it&apos;s still a piece of music much too long for its content.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=55703 href="#55703">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2004 8:31:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Blackwood reference<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?circle-of-5ths.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?circle-of-5ths.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A bibliographic reference over to Easley Blackwood&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; book would also be a nice addition to that page.

Ah well.</p><p>yes, that&apos;s something that i&apos;ve always felt lacking<br/>in Barbour too.  he wrote such an encyclopedic work,<br/>which makes it a great reference, but it definitely<br/>has a few strong biases.</p><p>&gt; But he does devote a good chunk of chapter<br/>&gt; 12 to 53edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And Friedrich Suppig&apos;s &quot;Calculus musicus&quot; of 1722 is<br/>&gt; about 19edo and 31edo, along with a pretty lousy piece<br/>&gt; &quot;Labyrinthus musicus&quot; (mostly a bunch of uninspired<br/>&gt; sequences, sounding like bad imitation Vivaldi).<br/>&gt; Granted, when I&apos;ve played through it, it hasn&apos;t been<br/>&gt; in 19edo or 31edo yet; but it&apos;s still a piece of music<br/>&gt; much too long for its content.</p><p>i&apos;d be very careful about assessing the value of a<br/>piece of music when you&apos;ve only heard it in a tuning<br/>which you know is not one that was intended for it.</p><p>try listening to some of the classics (i.e., meantone-based)<br/>in something like pelogic.  Gene Ward Smith just did<br/>this recently with the &quot;Dona Nobis Pacem&quot; from Bach&apos;s<br/>_B-minor Mass_.  it turns out that i really loved it,<br/>but it doesn&apos;t sound anything like the i&apos;m sure Bach<br/>intended it to sound.  it&apos;s at the bottom of this page:</p><p><a href="http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/mad.html">http://66.98.148.43/~xenharmo/mad.html</a></p><p>and a thread about it on this list begins here:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/55446">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/55446</a></p><p>it may be that Suppig&apos;s &quot;Labyrinthus&quot; sounds lousy<br/>in 12edo, but would sound fantastic in 19 or 31.<br/>i&apos;d have to at least examine the score (even better,<br/>listen to it) to know how similar or different either<br/>of those would sound from the 12edo version.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
