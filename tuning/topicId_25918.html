In the first place, I was a little<br/>surprised how, on the overall, intonation really does not<br/>take &quot;center stage&quot; in these string quartets.  With the exception of<br/>a couple of movements, for the most part I found it difficult to<br/>distinguish the intonation... assuming it was 5-limit just, from any<br/>other possibilities... Pythagorean, possibly or 12-tET.</p><p>Of course, for me, anyway, string quartets are a little &quot;slippery&quot;<br/>in this capacity... it seems to me they vary intonation &quot;all over the<br/>place&quot; and most performances seem to have somewhat fluctuating<br/>intonation...  maybe that&apos;s just *my* perception, but so it seems.</p><p>In any case, all the performances are quite competent.  I have no<br/>idea which quartet ensembles they are, since there was no<br/>accompanying literature with the self-produced CDs.  Really these<br/>pieces should be on commercial release.  Perhaps they will be, and<br/>this is the first step toward getting them there.  They could<br/>probably be used for that, except for a stray cough here and there<br/>which possibly could be excised...</p><p>Occasionally, I hear what might be termed &quot;string quartet ADAPTIVE<br/>intonation&quot; where the player will play the note first in 12-tET (or<br/>maybe Pythagorean??) and then &quot;adjust&quot; it quickly (usually lowering)<br/>to get the necessary 5-limit JI sonority.  Although, to be fair, that<br/>doesn&apos;t happen too much... but sometimes.</p><p>I listened to them all a couple of times, but really it will take<br/>more than that, so I only had a few cursory reactions:</p><p>String Quartet #1:  quite an early work... rather &quot;experimental&quot; with<br/>some strange &quot;John Cagean&quot; type silences mixed with some active<br/>counterpoint... er, &quot;peculiar...&quot; but pretty interesting.</p><p>String Quartet #2:  A major work from his earlier period, as any<br/>textbook will tell you.  Mostly serial, and especially the first<br/>movement sounds that way, but movement 2 has some really beautiful<br/>melodic passages, and movement 3 is perhaps the MOST &quot;xenharmonic&quot; of<br/>the whole set.  In that movement, microtonality takes &quot;center stage&quot;<br/>if that&apos;s where people like it...  As I mentioned, in several of the<br/>other quartets that&apos;s not necessarily the case.  That is not<br/>particularly a *criticism* in my book...</p><p>String Quartet #3:  Well, maybe the most &quot;solid&quot; from an earlier,<br/>serial standpoint.  This is a fine piece of music.  However, to me<br/>the relationship to &quot;alternate tunings&quot; seems somewhat minimal.<br/>Perhaps I&apos;ll have to listen again to get more of a connection...</p><p>String Quartet #4:  The famous, &quot;Amazing Grace...&quot;  and the *only*<br/>string quartet, to my knowledge, to be on commercial CD.  No need for<br/>*me* to comment on this one...</p><p>String Quartet #5:  One of my favorites, although I can&apos;t figure out<br/>what the quoted tune is.  Anybody know??  Very Charles Ivesian...<br/>This and some incredible counterpoint in the middle section make this<br/>a standout...  This is the one, though, where I heard some<br/>player &quot;adjustments&quot;  &quot;on the fly&quot; as it were.  (A live John<br/>deLaubenfels process!)</p><p>String Quartet #6:  This is an interesting piece, but I have a few<br/>problems with the length.  There are several LONG melodic lines that<br/>traverse various interesting harmonies.  It almost sounds as if<br/>Johnston was going through the lattice, or some such, with these<br/>harmonies, and the melodic lines are kind of just &quot;chugging<br/>along...&quot;  Maybe this was a performance problem and, in reality, the<br/>HARMONIES should take predominance and the melodic lines (first,<br/>cello, then viola, etc., etc.) should be *underplayed...*  Well, the<br/>*harmony* is really what&apos;s happening in this piece, at least so it<br/>seemed to me...</p><p>String Quartet #9:  Well, there were no recordings of #7 and #8 which<br/>is altogether unfortunate... since I really enjoyed the direction of<br/>#9 and it would be interesting to see how that evolved from the<br/>earlier ones.  Perhaps these pieces haven&apos;t been played??  Anybody<br/>know??  Anyway, #9 is much more &quot;post modern&quot;... i.e. no longer<br/>serial in orientation and blatently *tonal...*  The first movement I<br/>found particularly fine, with an interesting exploration of, I guess,<br/>5-limit tonalities in an almost &quot;minimalist&quot; mode...  The 3rd<br/>movement is practically a chorale.  Quite beautiful, but pretty<br/>traditional... I&apos;ll have to think about that one a while.  The 4th<br/>movement is, again, quite tonal but it gets a bit more chromatic,<br/>particularly in the first motive, possibly to counter the simple<br/>harmonies of the &quot;chorale...&quot;</p><p>Anyway, a great experience and, hopefully, these remastered CDs are<br/>the first step to getting these valuable pieces on commercial CD.<br/>That&apos;s where they belong, obviously....</p><p>_________ ______ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=25928 href="#25928">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2001 4:45:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, July 01, 2001 11:57 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Ben Johnston String Quartet CDs</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; String Quartet #6:  This is an interesting piece, but I have a few<br/>&gt; problems with the length.

Its based on the stream of conciousness writing. Ben&apos;s idea was have it sound like no line, harmony, or what not was more important than anything else during the piece(including harmony melody). Sure there is harmony in a sense, but it is subservient and not the most important idea in the music. So thats why when you listened it sounded like one line wasn&apos;t as important because it was designed to be that way.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; String Quartet #9:  Well, there were no recordings of #7 and #8 which<br/>&gt; is altogether unfortunate... since I really enjoyed the direction of<br/>&gt; #9 and it would be interesting to see how that evolved from the<br/>&gt; earlier ones.

(two joes = double the fun? hehe - thats a joke just not a very good one. Spare my poor humor)</p><p>If I remember correcly the 8th was performed but not recorded. The 7th has never been played (although I might have that backwards)The tenth has not been recorded or performed. It was written for Kronos, but they have been working on some arrangments Ben did of U.S. Highball. As for recordings Anything on the CD&apos;s that Ben is sending you soon has been recorded. Anything else has not been recorded unless someone bootlegged it without him knowing.</p><p>To Joe M. I think you can get a good semblance of where the ninth came from by looking at the 4th and 5th. By the time the 5th came around you can hear clearly he was starting to pull in the higher partials. Then it kept going and kept going. I shouldn&apos;t even specify those two really because the development has been going the whole time. The ninth pulls in alot of partials of course. The stuff he is working on now goes up to like the 50th partial or so ... somewhere around there. (not a string quartet)</p><p>&gt; Anyway, #9 is much more &quot;post modern&quot;... i.e. no longer<br/>&gt; serial in orientation and blatently *tonal...*  The first movement I<br/>&gt; found particularly fine, with an interesting exploration of, I guess,<br/>&gt; 5-limit tonalities in an almost &quot;minimalist&quot; mode...  The 3rd<br/>&gt; movement is practically a chorale.  Quite beautiful, but pretty<br/>&gt; traditional... I&apos;ll have to think about that one a while.  The 4th<br/>&gt; movement is, again, quite tonal but it gets a bit more chromatic,<br/>&gt; particularly in the first motive, possibly to counter the simple<br/>&gt; harmonies of the &quot;chorale...&quot;</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s really interesting to me to read your reactions &gt;upon listening<br/>&gt;to these pieces, Joe, because I already knew about &gt;their construction<br/>&gt;before I ever heard any of them, so I can&apos;t get &gt;the &quot;fresh&quot; reception<br/>&gt;that you can.</p><p>&gt;The 9th is actually Johnston&apos;s big stepping-stone into &gt;substantially<br/>&gt;higher-prime-limit harmonic territory.  He had settled &gt;on 13-limit<br/>&gt;during the 7th and 8th Quartets, then here in the 9th &gt;he goes all<br/>&gt;the way to 31.  That&apos;s another whole octave and 1/4 up &gt;the harmonic<br/>&gt;series.</p><p>&gt;So I&apos;m not surprised at all that a chorale is one of &gt;the stylistic<br/>&gt;touches... it would be a superb way to exploit great &gt;stacks of<br/>&gt;otonal harmonies.</p><p>To Joe M, Ben has done more stuff than the ninth that goes beyond thirteen for sure. I really dont think the ninth was the definitive piece that started all that for him. For that matter he talked about doing alot of this stuff with partch way back in 1950. Also realize that he has written more than just string quartets. This process of going into higher primes has been going on for a long time. The ninth may have been a general step in that direction, but it wasn&apos;t actually as significant as perhaps the fifth was in that direction in my opinion. Although it really doesn&apos;t matter and I&apos;m bickering over a small point really, I dont think the ninth was the first piece to go above 13. To be sure we would have look through his non-string quartet output.</p><p>As for Joe P&apos;s comments I think your pretty damn close. Heres a few notes to clarify things. I only say these things because by remastering Bens string quartet CD I had to become very familiar with his quartets.</p><p>First off this quartet should not be considered post modern. Have you read Bill Duckworth&apos;s Book , &quot;Talking Music&quot; ? He calls composers like Glenn Branca, John Zorn, and Blue Gene Tyranny as being postmodern. Ben really doesn&apos;t fit with any of these composers and defintiely not with what I see as being postmodern.</p><p>If asked how to classify his music he would say its revisionist. (He has said this to me many times) The concept actually comes from Bob Gilmore (via private conversation). Bob said, according to Ben, that Ben&apos;s music should be called revisionist because it takes ideas of form and what not and says, &quot;What would have happened if the traditional music would have been in just intonation instead of 12TET. What direction would they have gone in.&quot; (potentially)</p><p>So when you say it sounds chromatic you are exactly right, because thats the point it is chromatic. Its a different kind of chromatic per se, but chromatic nonetheless.</p><p>Also with the first movement of the ninth to better understand it look at the commas. Some chords can NOT be tuned exactly in tune by design. The performers have to fudge one way or another, and he did it on purpose. (to speak generally)In fact I think it has to do with his sense of humor to a certain extent. Like, &quot;Ha ha you have to play this out of tune.&quot;</p><p>Lastly as for some of the quartets being tonal. I think this can be seen as far back as the second quartet. Look at the second movement of the second quartet. it IS serial, but he designed the serialism in a way so that it starts to sound tonalish, or at least not overly dissonant. This is, I think, really when this sort of thing began in his music and it took off from there. This sort of idea, not necessarily relating to serialism, is to hide or conceal theory, technique, or whatever, so that its still listenable. Ben calls this idea &quot;art concealing art.&quot; The most known example of it is the fourth quartet. Notice here that this is basically Anti-Elitism while still pursuing generally new ideas.</p><p>Cheers Joes!<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=25943 href="#25943">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/1/2001 8:45:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_25918.html#25928">/tuning/topicId_25918.html#25928</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, I was working last year on a major analysis of this piece.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll see what I can dig up and upload in the near future.<br/>&gt; The harmony is indeed a central feature of the 6th Quartet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you ever get those issues of _Perspectives of New Music_<br/>&gt; with the microtonal articles?  The analysis by Steven Elster<br/>&gt; of the 6th is excellent, and points out the serial tonality<br/>&gt; manipulations in this piece.  It&apos;s pretty much the basis of<br/>&gt; what I&apos;m doing... I just add lattice diagrams, etc. ... you<br/>&gt; know me - lots of pretty pictures to explain all the math.<br/>&gt; (I&apos;ve cited Elster several times here - search the list archives.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, FINALLY I did my &quot;homework&quot; and went carefully through *both*<br/>Perspectives articles in a little under 3 hours!  That&apos;s the *first*<br/>read, though, but it was time VERY well spent, in my view.</p><p>In a way, it&apos;s a nice tribute to procrastination, since I&apos;ve had the<br/>Perspectives articles for about a month, and haven&apos;t read them.  In<br/>the *meantime* the STRING QUARTET CD came out!  You can imagine how<br/>much *more interesting* the Fonville and Elster articles were after<br/>HEARING the quartets!</p><p>I found the Fonville &quot;Guide&quot; to be *particularly* readable!  I&apos;d<br/>recommend that to anybody over practically *anything* about Johnston,<br/>as you did for me...  It really put a lot of things together for<br/>me...  I even understand that the chromatic semitone 25/24 PLUS the<br/>syntonic comma 81/80 = 135/128... which is a VERY important interval<br/>for Johnston, particularly in the 6th quartet!</p><p>I was wondering if you could help me with one thing, Monz??</p><p>At the end of the Fonville &quot;Guide&quot; Fonville states:  &quot;A complete<br/>listing (notation, ratios, and cent values) of all the lattice<br/>structures up to 31, including all possible combinations Johnston has<br/>used, is available from the author.&quot;</p><p>The author being Fonville, not Johnston, in this case... I was<br/>wondering how to contact Fonville??  Or is it possible that<br/>the &quot;miraculous monz&quot; would *also* have such a similar chart??</p><p>I shore would like one of &apos;em....  (will pay $$)</p><p>Now on to a general, interesting, and important consideration about<br/>Johnston&apos;s processes on the overview.  This study was PARTICULARLY<br/>important for me, because it indicated to me how FAR certain<br/>composers go into &quot;precompositional&quot; ideas.... particularly<br/>Johnston&apos;s construction of the 6th String Quartet.</p><p>I thought I was really doing something by finding harmonies through<br/>common tones in a blackjack lattice, but this is all CHILD&apos;S PLAY<br/>compared with the intricate and elaborate pre-compositional structure<br/>that Johnston sets up for the 6th String Quartet as explained, rather<br/>clearly I might add, by Steven Elster...</p><p>Now the question is whether this pre-compositional activity for the<br/>6th String Quartet isn&apos;t perhaps a bit &quot;over cooked...&quot;  Well, what<br/>I&apos;m saying is that of ALL the quartets it was actually my LEAST<br/>favorite.... I liked the beginning, but the long melodies really<br/>seemed repetitive, and it seemed like he was spinning out<br/>(ausspinungspiel) some kind of gestalt and *had* to get through with<br/>it...</p><p>Is *this* where such detailed pre-compositional work leads??</p><p>Well, it may be just *me!!*  I have similar problems with some of the<br/>works of Milton Babbitt... cool dude he can sometimes be...</p><p>Getting to the Elster... what was PARTICULARLY fascinating to me was<br/>his presentation of SERIAL CHARTS in HARMONIC SERIES ORDER.  I<br/>capitalize these words, because this really made a BIG impression<br/>with me.  Like many people, I have studied serial rows and matrices<br/>up the wazoo, but *never* did I see them organized by harmonic series<br/>principles.</p><p>This idea, and I believe this is *probably* at the CORE of Ben<br/>Johnston&apos;s serialism, was VERY striking to me... and I think that<br/>Elster VERY clearly demonstrated it.</p><p>Also, there was a very neat chart which showed all the common tones<br/>from the hexachords... and these common tones are used in the piece<br/>to join hexachords together.  Actually, it looks as though he uses a<br/>LOT of common hexachords between rows such as Retrograde and<br/>Retrograde Inversion...</p><p>Elster points out the important structure of the two complementary<br/>hexachords of the row (used to be called &quot;combinatoriality&quot;) with<br/>transposition by that all important 135/128... a combination of<br/>a &quot;chromatic&quot; adjustment with &quot;justice...&quot; our syntonic comma.  Very<br/>cool...</p><p>Man, that&apos;s neat.</p><p>Things get a little freer about the middle of the quartet and then,<br/>this is just my theory, Johnston becomes conceptually exhausted and<br/>runs the ENTIRE THING BACKWARDS in a giant palindrome!</p><p>Maybe that&apos;s why I find it a little repetitive.  The beginning is<br/>great, though.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 9th is actually Johnston&apos;s big stepping-stone into substantially<br/>&gt; higher-prime-limit harmonic territory.  He had settled on 13-limit<br/>&gt; during the 7th and 8th Quartets, then here in the 9th he goes all<br/>&gt; the way to 31.  That&apos;s another whole octave and 1/4 up the harmonic<br/>&gt; series.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Actually, I had *no* idea that he was using the 11th partial in the<br/>6th String Quartet... so all of this was a surprise.</p><p>An interesting UNDERSTATEMENT by Steven Elster reads as<br/>follows:  &quot;Executing an accurate eleventh partial, without having<br/>actually heard a fundamental pitch, will always be difficult...&quot;</p><p>My personal response:  NO KIDDING!</p><p>Really, I sometimes wonder how accurate these quartet performances<br/>are....  The suggestions by Elster for the performance of the 6th<br/>really seem impractical to me.  He&apos;s talking about performers<br/>analyzing the piece and figuring out how the 11th partial sounds by<br/>listening to the hexachords underneath, etc., etc...</p><p>How practical is all this, really??  I wonder.</p><p>It makes me run back to 72-tET in a BIG HURRY!... Well, good luck to<br/>them, anyway.  Hopefully everybody will find performers who have also<br/>majored in music theory and WANT to play music through theoretical<br/>analysis.</p><p>Such performers don&apos;t exist too much in the &quot;real&quot; performing<br/>world... I don&apos;t believe...</p><p>All of this, however, is a rich and rewarding study....</p><p>Will this study benefit my *own* music??...  Well, it certainly sets<br/>certain paradigms for &quot;well thought out&quot; music...  maybe even &quot;too<br/>cooked!&quot;</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>_______ ______ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=25944 href="#25944">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/1/2001 9:01:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_25918.html#25937">/tuning/topicId_25918.html#25937</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  To Joe P.

Its based on the stream of conciousness writing. Ben&apos;s<br/>&gt; idea was have it sound like no line, harmony, or what not was more<br/>&gt; important than anything else during the piece(including harmony<br/>&gt; melody). Sure there is harmony in a sense, but it is subservient and<br/>&gt; not the most important idea in the music. So thats why when you<br/>&gt; listened it sounded like one line wasn&apos;t as important because it was<br/>&gt; designed to be that way.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Andy!  Well, I see what you&apos;re saying, but it seems a bit of a<br/>&gt; stretch to call this quartet &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; after reading<br/>&gt; the detailed analysis by Steven Elster!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe &quot;process music&quot; would be a better term for it.  This particular<br/>&gt; quartet really is akin, in some ways to so called &quot;process&quot; pieces...<br/>&gt; (that&apos;s not a deprication, by the way...)</p><p>Hehe, well those are Ben&apos;s words not mine. He got the idea from James Joyce,<br/>and therefore stream of conciousness seemed appropriate to describe it. The<br/>funny thing with Ben&apos;s music is that there are huge theoretical underpinnings<br/>as you said ... dont get to caught up in that aspect. The other day I was<br/>asking him about some stuff in a score we&apos;re putting on finale. I asked him<br/>about his note choices in a certain passage and his response was, to my<br/>surprise, that he was just being a composer. Yes there is theory involved,<br/>but my impression from Ben is that he lets his intuition guide him more than<br/>anything else.</p><p>Funny the reaction that you gave about this Ben has told me several stories<br/>about before where people have said exactly the same thing. He mentioned<br/>someone saying the same thing about the fourth quartet. They read an article<br/>about it and they thought it was like some dissonant thing that is hugely<br/>complicated. Then they heard it...  this is exactly art concealing art. He<br/>uses the theory, but its all hidden away - and my gues, this is a guess mind<br/>you, is that its hidden away in his brain as well.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I remember correcly the 8th was performed but not recorded.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Man... how could anybody DO that!  That boggles the brain more than<br/>&gt; the music...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I know!!!!! I coulnd&apos;t believe it either!</p><p>&gt; &gt; As for Joe P&apos;s comments I think your pretty damn close. Heres a few<br/>&gt; notes to clarify things. I only say these things because by<br/>&gt; remastering Bens string quartet CD I had to become very familiar with<br/>&gt; his quartets.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; First off this quartet should not be considered post modern. Have<br/>&gt; you read Bill Duckworth&apos;s Book , &quot;Talking Music&quot; ? He calls composers<br/>&gt; like Glenn Branca, John Zorn, and Blue Gene Tyranny as being<br/>&gt; postmodern. Ben really doesn&apos;t fit with any of these composers and<br/>&gt; defintiely not with what I see as being postmodern.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well... Andy, this is a broad term... at least as it&apos;s been used in<br/>&gt; New York for about the last decade or so.  It also takes in the so-<br/>&gt; called &quot;New Romanticism&quot; that we&apos;ve seen around since the early<br/>&gt; 1980&apos;s... maybe before in such composers as George Rochberg, George<br/>&gt; Crumb and David del Tredici...  so actually if you consider<br/>&gt; serialism &quot;modern&quot; and the earlier works of Ben Johnston &quot;modern,&quot;<br/>&gt; then the later ones really would be &quot;post modern&quot; I do believe...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how you could differentiate the kind of &quot;Bang on a Can&quot;<br/>&gt; type composers you cite... maybe &quot;raving post modern&quot; or some such! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hehe yaa I gotcha. I kind of like the term raving post modern. Or perhaps,<br/>&quot;Ass kicking music.&quot;  Hehehehe I mentioned those composers in relation to<br/>postmodern because thats the category they&apos;re under in Duckworth&apos;s book. I<br/>hide behnd my source    allthough        When you really want to get right<br/>down to the semantics the term post-modern is pretty silly anyway. Post<br/>modern?  It almost makes it sound like we&apos;re discussing composers not yet<br/>born... and it certainly doesn&apos;t tell you what the music sounds like. Perhaps<br/>instead we should call the composers I mentioned, &quot;Raving Postmodern ass<br/>kicking music&quot; (just kidding by the way) Or even better not use the term post<br/>modern at all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If asked how to classify his music he would say its revisionist.<br/>&gt; (He has said this to me many times) The concept actually comes from<br/>&gt; Bob Gilmore (via private conversation). Bob said, according to Ben,<br/>&gt; that Ben&apos;s music should be called revisionist because it takes ideas<br/>&gt; of form and what not and says, &quot;What would have happened if the<br/>&gt; traditional music would have been in just intonation instead of<br/>&gt; 12TET. What direction would they have gone in.&quot; (potentially)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I could see that.  However, really the *net* effect of<br/>&gt; Johnston&apos;s music falls right into the particular zeitgeist he was in<br/>&gt; at any particular time.  When there was &quot;modernism&quot; HE was modern...<br/>&gt; when there was &quot;new romanticism,&quot; HE was &quot;new romantic...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Frankly, I don&apos;t believe he is as far from other composers and<br/>&gt; general trends as the term &quot;revisionist&quot; would indicate, but I<br/>&gt; suppose this is open to dispute...  We can think about it!  :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________ ______ _______<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well dont forget that my reaction was to your saying the 9th quartet was post<br/>modern. I didn&apos;t think you meant all of his music was post modern, and I<br/>SURELY didn&apos;t mean ALL of his music is revisionist ... just some pieces<br/>really, and the ninth quartet is most definitely revisionist. I will explain<br/>this term better in a moment. As for the other periods of his music, however,<br/>his music was definitely much different and revisionist doesn&apos;t fit it.</p><p>Revisionist isn&apos;t meant to mean away from current trends or composers. What<br/>Bob Gilmore, to put words in his mouth, meant was that its a revision of OLD<br/>composers. For example it could be a revision of Wagner taking chromaticism<br/>to a new place. Its not intended to mean revising george crumb or another<br/>current trend. Ben&apos;s music relates quite a bit to some current trends. It<br/>also doesn&apos;t mean emulating a composers style per se, but revising tonality<br/>very generally with modern JI which is seemingly the point of a piece like<br/>the ninth and some other stuff - mostly newer stuff. This term couldn&apos;t even<br/>be applied to some of his earlier stuff because the notation to do the<br/>chromaticism hadn&apos;t yet been developed!! As I said it asks, &quot;what if 12 TET<br/>wasn&apos;t adopted what would the music have sounded like.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m well aware this doesn&apos;t apply to all of his music. Certainly not. But it<br/>definitiely applies to the ninth quartet which is what we were discussing<br/>anyway. (or perhaps we were both discussing different things  - this english<br/>language needs to be revised I think)</p><p>Cheers Joe!<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=25956 href="#25956">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>7/2/2001 6:06:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_25918.html#25947">/tuning/topicId_25918.html#25947</a></p><p>&gt; In a message dated 7/1/2001 11:45:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>&gt; jpehrson@r... writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was wondering if you could help me with one thing, Monz??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At the end of the Fonville &quot;Guide&quot; Fonville states:  &quot;A complete<br/>&gt; &gt; listing (notation, ratios, and cent values) of all the lattice<br/>&gt; &gt; structures up to 31, including all possible combinations Johnston<br/>has used, is available from the author.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The author being Fonville, not Johnston, in this case...

He&apos;s talking about performers<br/>&gt; analyzing the piece and figuring out how the 11th partial sounds by<br/>&gt; listening to the hexachords underneath, etc., etc...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How practical is all this, really??

I would argue that JI intervals through the 11-limit should be<br/>used in order to _learn_ 72-tET -- rather than 72-tET being used to<br/>get around the necessity of being able to hear and perform 11-limit<br/>JI intervals!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Will this study benefit my *own* music??...  Well, it certainly<br/>sets<br/>&gt; certain paradigms for &quot;well thought out&quot; music...  maybe even &quot;too<br/>&gt; cooked!&quot;</p><p>Perhaps in the _harmonies_ in this quartet, and other elements in the<br/>other quartets, you can find a great deal of inspiration . . . ?

I worked hard to remaster the recordings as best as I could and I was quite happy with the result.</p><p>As for the other discussion (below) I think theres some merit to these things. I know that I am certainly not trying to put praise towards Ben, Schoenberg or anyone really. I dont think anyone is saying that I am, but I want to make it clear that I&apos;m not. As for myself my favorite type of music is probably a combo of different popular musics with a little unpopular musics (hehe) thrown in... I love new metal for example. Really these are all just matters of taste however. I cant stand Webern&apos;s music, but I love Limp Bizkit. I love Arvo Part, but I&apos;m not particularly fond of Black Sabbath. With Phillip Glass its hit and miss whether I like any given song, but with Steve Reich and Pink Floyd I love just about everything (not completely but close). Everyone has tastes and thats ok.</p><p>This is all valuable to a certain extent, but really its just my opinion and has no bearing on the real world. Same with these CD&apos;s. Some will enjoy it and some wont. Some will think Ben is a mediocre composer, or that they enjoy the theory but not the tunes or what not, and some will think he&apos;s the best thing since bread and butter. Or if you, whomever is reading at this moment, dont like bread and butter perhaps since microwavable macaroni...</p><p>So is Ben the best, the worst, or somewhere in between?

In all honesty I know a chunk about audio,<br/>music, and<br/>&gt; what not, but I really dont know much about the process of setting<br/>up a<br/>&gt; commercial classical album. I have some experience as a radio DJ so<br/>I have a<br/>&gt; contact or two around, but I wouldn&apos;t even know where to begin. I<br/>dont know<br/>&gt; if this is what Ben wants anyway ... but your right it would be<br/>helpful for<br/>&gt; people that want to listen to or study his music to have a<br/>commercial album<br/>&gt; available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tell you what. I&apos;ll run it by him and see what he thinks about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers Joe! I made those copies yesterday and I will be sending them<br/>to you<br/>&gt; soon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andy</p><p>Thanks so much, Andy...</p><p>Well, as you have already surmised, I&apos;m saying that possibly YOU<br/>should be the &quot;point person&quot; for the commercial CD.  I&apos;m not trying to<br/>&quot;assign work&quot; or anything :) but it sounds like Johnston is not the<br/>kind of composer who would do this kind of work himself.  I KNOW what<br/>I&apos;m talking about here, because I know other composers in the same<br/>situation, and who have the same kinds of attitudes (actually La Monte<br/>Young has, unfortunately, the same feelings about recordings... one<br/>reason there are FEW CDs of his works!)</p><p>I would recommend that you research funding possibilites for such a<br/>CD... Mary Flagler Cary, Aaron Copland Fund and the Jerome<br/>Foundation are three such recording possibilities....  These are hard<br/>for *me* as a composer to get, but with a name like Ben Johnston, it<br/>should be possible.</p><p>Any further information on funding possibilities I can provide<br/>offlist...</p><p>best,</p><p>________ ______ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=26265 href="#26265">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>7/17/2001 6:35:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;Clearly, the first movement is based on an entire<br/>&gt;diatonic scale played as a chord.
