Frankly, when I first<br/>got this CD at the Claremont MicroFest, I thought it was superfluous<br/>as part of his written package &quot;Microtonality, Past, Present, Future&quot;<br/>which I STILL haven&apos;t found time to read (enough of such griping...)<br/>BUT I did get a chance to listen to the CD.</p><p>The CD, although understandable and appropriate for beginners, is<br/>decidedly NOT puerile stuff, and there is much for more &quot;seasoned&quot;<br/>participants in it as well.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.</p><p>I had a couple of &quot;take aways&quot; that I would like to share with the<br/>group and which may or may not prompt further commentary.  Ironically<br/>enough, McLaren&apos;s frequent point about all the theorists not hearing<br/>music, blah, blah, was not one of them!  I mean, that&apos;s pretty<br/>evident in certain cases, particularly when the theoritician or<br/>scientist/mathematician is not a composer.  I don&apos;t believe that<br/>finding is really as &quot;revolutionary&quot; as the clever Mr. Zill (with all<br/>due respect) seems to feel it is.</p><p>HOWEVER, THESE are the significant &quot;take aways&quot; that remained in my<br/>mind:</p><p>1) The importance of experience in and participation in a VARIETY of<br/>different tunings.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve been trying to do this... but I guess I&apos;m very big right<br/>now on the current &quot;Miracle&quot; developments.  However, McLaren is<br/>making me rethink the idea that possibly I will spend the &quot;rest of my<br/>life&quot; with &quot;blackjack&quot; and 72-tET.  Maybe not so smart given all the<br/>other alternatives...  For a while, possibly.</p><p>2) A real question as to the significance of Just Intonation and<br/>harmonic series frequency ratios as a basis of music vis a vis<br/>perceptibility.</p><p>I believe this is an area where McLaren and Paul Erlich differ<br/>strongly.  McLaren views all music as a process of &quot;acculturation&quot;<br/>and doesn&apos;t feel that just ratios are particularly significant as an<br/>audible &quot;stopping point&quot; other than their establishment in a<br/>cultural sense.</p><p>Dunno.  That seems to &quot;fly in the face&quot; of Helmholtz, Partch and such<br/>like... and certain scientific studies that, if I recall, associate<br/>small integer frequency ratios with particular INGRAINED human<br/>responses....</p><p>McLaren, of course, points to all the different cultures which do NOT<br/>use just ratios but more &quot;non just, non equal&quot; or inharmonic timbres<br/>a la Sethares...  And, it does seem to be an area in which McLaren<br/>excells in his own music, at least what I have heard so far.  It also<br/>seems like an area where advanced scientific or mathematical thinking<br/>could also contribute... possibly MORE than in the JI realm, but OF<br/>COURSE, filtered through EXPERIENCE as McLaren gently suggests...</p><p>Dunno.  Is there anything really &quot;special&quot; about Just Intonation that<br/>is not just acculturation like everything else??  Do I react to small<br/>interger ratios or their approximations BECAUSE of my exposure to and<br/>thorough immersion in Western culture and NOT because of any endemic<br/>PHYSICAL response?</p><p>I have absolutely no idea.  However, I do know those simple ratios<br/>have a &quot;resonance,&quot; literally, with me... and it&apos;s going to be pretty<br/>hard to &quot;break away&quot; from my &quot;Western Civ.&quot; background.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s the McLaren CD.

Don&apos;t you<br/>think it would be reasonable to say that although you have heard dominant<br/>seventh chords on the piano that you had also heard 4:5:6:7, meaning a just<br/>dom seventh, in different contexts and also without knowing that that is what<br/>you were hearing?

At the time I didn&apos;t really get why major<br/>thirds had to be out of tune, but later after studying tuning more the sounds<br/>were the same but the theory was more clear.The experience of hearing a just<br/>third didn&apos;t at all show me a new sound, but it did give me a new name to<br/>identify a sound which I already knew. I would say the same thing with the<br/>dom seventh chord, at least for myself. The point of this rant is that,<br/>perhaps, you were more accustomed to just chords than you think because music<br/>you&apos;ve listened to was tuned up by the players intuitively. Maybe that is a<br/>reason why you would tend to like just chords.</p><p>Lastly, maybe this really isn&apos;t true with you specifically , because I dont<br/>know ... maybe your experience is mostly with piano.
