As I said before, the Progression of musical cells was derived in 1983-1985. At that time computers and obviously the excel program were not available so the only ways to develope the progression were to work with a 12 digit electronic calculator or by using common fractions; I already had decided (32805/32768) = schisma = M as the first cell.</p><p>2) By analysis and reasoning the second cell had to be  (32805/32768)^2 and got a second cell that was a big common fraction. Then the three initial cells were 1, M, M^2.</p><p>3) The progression requirements opposed to a third M comma factor and I had to devote about two months to derive the second type of comma factor that was named<br/>J = (2^25)*2^(1/4) / (3^13)*5^2. The third cell was the product J* (32805/32768)^2 that gave a monstrous combination of common fractions and powers even after reducing terms.</p><p>4) I continued with common fractions up to the 7th cell and after knowing that the octave would comprise about 600 cells, stopped working with common fractions and powers.</p><p>5) Converted all the obtained monstruos cells to 8 digit decimal numbers but soon I realized that 11 decimal digits could reduce errors that meant 12 digits like 1.05349794239.</p><p>6) Mike: Now you know why had to use decimal frequencies in the progression.</p><p>I will continue this message as soon as possible.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>piagui@...<br/>Lima, January 11, 2010<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Mike Battaglia<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Monday, January 11, 2010 2:15 PM<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Four cents + two cents</p><p>  There are certain contexts in which a 4 cent deviation would be noticeable.

Therefore, since the average of those deviatons is greater than 2 which is considered the sensitivity threshold according to a skilled adviser, we can conclude that this scale is distinguishabe from 12 tet. And this was proven when a similar scale (Piagui I) was compared to 12 tet by listening dozens of chords given by two grand pianos in 2004. Now, since Piagui I D major showed imperfection, I am talking about JUSTHARM II scale.</p><p>Yesterday, I explained you the origins of 11 digit decimal cell values of the progression; if I wouldn&apos;t had used decimal numbers for cell frequencies, I wouldn&apos;t had settled the progression. When I was a boy, a long time ago, I didn&apos;t claim for using 12 decimal figures given by the logarithm table and had no any problem with the meaning of each of its thousands values. Technology cancelled the use of that table, however, I could cite many natural variables which now are measured with decimal numbers, you know that. More, all people know within a tenth of a second that frequency 1.5802469 is higher than 1.5625 but all of them need to make calculations to know if 25/16 is or it is not higher than 405/256.<br/>Conclusion: The progression of cells given in decimal number facilitate the obtainment of frequency ratios, rate of cells expansion toward the octave 2C = 2 and other features.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, January 12, 2010 -- 12:20 p.m.</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Mike Battaglia<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Monday, January 11, 2010 2:15 PM<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Four cents + two cents</p><p>  &lt;There are certain contexts in which a 4 cent deviation would be noticeable.
