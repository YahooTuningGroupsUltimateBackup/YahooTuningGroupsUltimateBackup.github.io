You have, however, managed to put your own spin on what the purpose of the tuning list is, and it doesn&apos;t match up with what this forum is really concerned with. If you read the statement on the home page:</p><p>&quot;This mailing list is intended for exchanging ideas relevant to alternate musical tunings: just intonation; paratactical tunings; experimental instrument design; non-standard equal temperaments; MIDI tuning-system specs; concert postings; gamelan tunings and other non-western tunings; historical tunings; the experimental tunings of Harry Partch, Lou Harrison, Martin Bartlett, James Tenney, and so on; software reports; recordings; books; research sources, etcetera.&quot;</p><p>All of that comes before anything else, and it should be very clear that it is NOT a place for theoretical discussions that relate to 12tet/edo. In fact, this is one of the *only* places to speak about everything BUT 12tet/edo! So with that much said, I&apos;ll just mention a couple of your points, and then butt out.</p><p>&quot;To say MIDI isn&apos;t tuning-related is ridiculous, since synthesizers are the only instruments that allow alternative tunings.&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t believe you actually wrote that - there are a lot of instruments that are microtonal. There have been for centuries. There are entire bodies of music, repertoires of depth, that pre-date (and will probably post-date) MIDI. Not to mention that one of the biggest difficulties has been to get MIDI to *BE* microtonal, something many of us have worked on for years. BTW, the first piece of MIDI gear I owned and used was purchased over 25 years ago. Many of us have been actively using MIDI for a long time.</p><p>&quot;And, last but not least THE GROUP MODERATOR ALLOWED THE POST THROUGH! Are you second-guessing him/her?&quot;</p><p>To say that this list is virtually unmoderated would be one of the universe&apos;s biggest understatements. There have been times when we&apos;ve pulled our hair out trying to get a hold of Mark for one reason or another! That your post got through means absolutely zero - *every* post gets through.</p><p>&quot;Where else to better discuss meta-theoretical issues than on this list, which is de-facto meta-theoretical because it is about alternative tunings and their rationale.&quot;</p><p>Again, that is your spin on it, because this was not intended as a &quot;meta-theoretical&quot; list, but a list about alternative tunings. When you have some hard data/discoveries that actually involve non-12, bring it on. Otherwise, it is noise in the signal, however well-intentioned.</p><p>&quot;What I&apos;m saying is that I&apos;ve made discoveries that go way beyond even conventional 12EDO pitch class set theory, and a lot of it is applicable to other tunings than 12EDO.&quot;</p><p>Then apply them, and show us something. Most of us like music, not just lists of numbers, etc. (Well, maybe &quot;most&quot; is subjective!) I&apos;ve actually taken the time to snag a few of your generated &quot;melodies&quot;, and they didn&apos;t convince me of anything other than a person can put notes in ordered fashions in a lot of different ways. Maybe if they were integrated into a piece of music it might begin to make sense.</p><p>OK, that&apos;s enough from me. No one is trying to be rude, but this list has a fairly clear purpose, and with most people&apos;s time being short, we don&apos;t like to have a lot of extra noise in the bandwidth of the postings. If it really relates to an alternate tuning, it&apos;s use or development, fine. If not, you have plenty of other places to post. That small amount of respect I&apos;m certain you can afford us.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=68472 href="#68472">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/16/2006 1:45:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To say that this list is virtually unmoderated would be one of the<br/>universe&apos;s biggest understatements.

Let&apos;s face it,<br/>just because the strings can sound any frequency in their pitch continuum<br/>does not mean that they are designed to accomodate alternate tunings.

But mostly spam,<br/>since the default here is set to moderator approval, which you need to<br/>post non-spam on your first posting to get rid of.</p><p>Then there is a automatic marking of postings by Yahoo as probable<br/>spam; this is mostly incorrect. For instance a recent posting by<br/>Herman got marked as probable spam because he used the word &quot;spam&quot; in<br/>it, and it had to be approved. This article would no doubt require<br/>approval except as I am a moderator it probably will not.</p></div>
