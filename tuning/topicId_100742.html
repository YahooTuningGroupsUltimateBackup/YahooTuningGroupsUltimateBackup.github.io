Well, at least, he believed it, and he would frequently refer<br/>to himself as such in interviews, also saying &quot;it ain&apos;t braggin&apos; if<br/>you can back it up.&quot; He also used to teach at UM, and quite a few<br/>people who worked with him were my teachers while I was there.</p><p>Despite being known more for his ridiculous virtuosity on the fretless<br/>bass, he&apos;s also one of the most creative and inventive jazz composers<br/>out there.

After his death, I did have an experience that I would like to share here...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>A friend had a recording project that was going on for about a month at a studio down in Tampa, and I was there almost every day during that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day&nbsp; I heard a tall young fellow in the hallway playing his bass. It seemed like he was just noodling along, playing like he was doing finger exercises that seemed more like speed gymnastics than music...it turned out that it was Jaco&apos;s son and he was in fact playing every note of the session he was about to do that day, at a pace that was at least ten times the actual recorded tempo.&nbsp; Looks like the&nbsp; Pastorius family may have more shoes to fill one day.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Tim<br/>&nbsp;<br/>...<br/>&nbsp;</p><p>--- On Wed, 7/13/11, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Jaco Pastorius as microtonalist in 12-equal<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, July 13, 2011, 7:56 AM</p><p>For those who don&apos;t know, Jaco Pastorius is one of the defining<br/>figures in the evolution of the electric bass, and influenced every<br/>major bass player to come after him.
