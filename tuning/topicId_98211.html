To my ears, the Mills Brothers and the Delta Rythm Boys sometimes have a lot of septimal chords in their music.

You<br/>can hear septimal intonation sometimes in old cartoons.</p><p>I became a big fan of the Golden Gate quartet after Daniel<br/>Wolf recommended them to me.</p><p>On the whole though, I&apos;ve noticed very little septimal<br/>intonation in this genre, or in doo-wop.  I don&apos;t why this<br/>is, though it is worth noting that it often employs<br/>accompaniment such as piano &amp; drums.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2011 9:31:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On the whole though, I&apos;ve noticed very little septimal<br/>&gt; intonation in this genre, or in doo-wop.

I went searching on YouTube and couldn&apos;t find an example like the one I was thinking of, with the Delta Rhythm Boys singing a capella. But I did find a lot of neat songs, such as Take the A Train, Gimme Some Skin and Rigoletto.</p></div>
