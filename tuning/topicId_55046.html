Usually one can find<br/>something or other of that ilk espeically<br/>if it is a practically applied area of maths<br/>and a newbie type explanation needs to focus<br/>on those points.</p><p>I know that you did that with your post<br/>but it was still a bit technical for<br/>a newbie I felt, so my post was an attempt<br/>to just express the same material that<br/>you presented less technically. But<br/>probably I failed at that - well<br/>presented what I understood of it but<br/>apparently what I didn&apos;t present<br/>was the more important aspect of it<br/>and skewed it to the extent of being<br/>misleading.</p><p>Sorry about that. Never mind, and<br/>maybe someone else can step in<br/>and give it a go.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
