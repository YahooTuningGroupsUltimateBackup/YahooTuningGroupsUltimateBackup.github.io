No one has ever successfully analyzed or described a<br/>painting by extracting and systematically classifying the colors into<br/>&quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; categories.  Warm needs Cold.  Cold needs<br/>Warm.  Rational needs Irrational.  Irrational needs Rational.</p><p>(Please note that in the table below, the symbol ( _| ) represents<br/>the Square Root Symbol.)</p><p>The following quote is from my manuscript Musical Mathematics:<br/>A Practice in the Mathematics of Tuning Instruments and<br/>Analyzing Scales, Chapter 10:</p><p>******************************</p><p>Table 10</p><p>Arithmetic Mean                 Geometric Mean</p><p>2/1: (1000+500)/2 = 750         2/1: _|1000*500 = 707.1<br/>4/3: (1000+750)/2 = 875         4/3: _|1000*750 = 866.0<br/>8/7: (1000+875)/2 = 937.5       8/7: _|1000*875 = 935.4<br/>16/15: (1000+937.5)/2 = 968.8   16/15: _|1000*937.5 = 968.2<br/>32/31: (1000+968.8)/2 = 984.4   32/31: _|1000*968.8 = 984.3</p><p>(64/63, etc.)</p><p>According to these figures, the arithmetic mean of the &quot;octave&quot;<br/>expressed as length ratio 2/1 requires a bridge at 750.0 mm,<br/>whereas the geometric mean requires a bridge at 707.1 mm.<br/>Table 10 shows that for a sequentially decreasing progression of<br/>length ratios, the bridge locations of these two different means<br/>begin to converge !  For example, the arithmetic mean of length<br/>ratio 8/7 requires a bridge at 937.5 mm, and the geometric mean,<br/>a bridge at 935.4 mm;  here the difference is 2.1 mm.  Next, the<br/>arithmetic mean of length ratio 16/15 requires a bridge at 968.8<br/>mm, and the geometric mean, a bridge at 968.2 mm;  here the<br/>difference is only .6 mm.  However, because the arithmetic means<br/>represent rational numbers, and the geometric means represent<br/>irrational numbers, these two sets of numbers can never be<br/>identical.  Mathematicians refer to values or lines that converge<br/>but never meet or intersect as asymptotes.</p><p>******************************</p><p>Just/Rational Intonation, Tempered/Irrational Intonation, I don&apos;t<br/>think it really matters what you call it.  All experienced composers<br/>know that the aural experience of a Rational/Irrational Asymptote<br/>(RIA) accurately describes how far or how near the intervals of a<br/>given tuning are to just/rational or tempered/irrational values.</p><p>Cris Forster, Music Director<br/><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p><p><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/musical_mathematics.htm">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/musical_mathematics.htm</a></p></div>
