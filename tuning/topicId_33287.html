Here are some examples<br/>of pure colours. Now these other ones are colours of the same hue but<br/>different degrees of purity (or saturation). This one is really close<br/>to pure. So now do you get what we mean by &quot;pure&quot;? Do you think this<br/>one is pure?&quot; And so on.</p><p>We can do the same thing to teach people what we mean by &quot;just&quot;<br/>for harmony. Maybe twanging a few guitar strings simuktaneously and<br/>varing the pitch of one string while saying stuff like &quot;Hear how<br/>there&apos;s a sort of beating effect that slows down and then speeds up<br/>again. When it&apos;s so slow that you can only tell its there by listening<br/>for longer than any sustained harmonies you intend to use in actual<br/>music, then that&apos;s called &quot;just&quot;.&quot; The definition is refined by<br/>listening to more things which are near the boundary and having people<br/>tell you whether they are generally considerd to be just in or just<br/>out of Just. Popular borderline cases are the Hammond Organ,<br/>Barbershop singing and La Monte Young&apos;s dream house. I understand most<br/>people would exclude the Hammond and include the other two.</p><p>A context-sensitive perceptually-based definition seems to work for<br/>this, although it may make sense to say that the Hammond is just for<br/>those timbres (stop settings) where there are partials whose<br/>relationship to the fundamental is the same as the intervals of the<br/>scale (essentially 12-tET). This is the inharmonic Sethares type of<br/>&quot;justness&quot; that is still unclear (to me) how it should be classified.<br/>It has nothing to do with the fact that the Hammond uses rational<br/>frequency ratios. But to me, the Hammond tuning, when using a nearly<br/>simusoidal timbre, is not just, despite being entirely based on<br/>strict ratios of whole-numbers less than 100.</p><p>&gt; But I am more interested in what *you* consider as &quot;pure&quot;<br/>&gt; *sound*.</p><p>Now wait a minute.

Can anybody see the logical flaw here?</p><p>Gimme a break. There&apos;s no logical flaw. It&apos;s just that it is obviously<br/>not a &quot;definition&quot; of just intonation to merely say just = pure.<br/>Nevertheless dictionaries are full of such things, even going in<br/>circles. And it may in fact be helpful to someone who already has the<br/>right concept of just intonation but knows it only under the term<br/>&quot;pure&quot;. It&apos;s the last part of the OED def that is more useful if you<br/>don&apos;t already have the concept. &quot;sounding perfectly in tune&quot;. And I<br/>never claimed that _that_ was sufficient either.
