Mozart is very conservative in terms of the variety<br/>of tonalities through which he passes (it&apos;s his treatment of vertical<br/>dissonances and asymmetrical phrasing that are radical).  In the Viennese<br/>classical repertoire, it is only with late Haydn and Beethoven that a<br/>circular temperament becomes advantageous.</p></div><h3>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@shell1.tiac.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2000 6:55:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 23 May 2000, Daniel Wolf wrote, to John deLaubenfels&apos;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;Even Mozart was known to go &apos;round the circle of fifths every now and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;then just for fun, wasn&apos;t he?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich is right.

It&apos;s at least a good thing to know<br/>that if you are giving a mixed program and don&apos;t have time to retune in<br/>the middle you can play 16th and 17th century music PLUS Mozart on the<br/>same keyboard, with maybe readjusting the g#&apos;s, but if you want to play<br/>the same early stuff with Bach or Telemann or Haydn you might be in<br/>trouble.</p><p>Judy</p></div>
