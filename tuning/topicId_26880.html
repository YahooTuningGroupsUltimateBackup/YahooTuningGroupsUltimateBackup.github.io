The point was, it would be great<br/>to include the idea that the two sizes of D are the SECOND FIFTH in<br/>the chain of fifths, and the tempering is thereby ONE HALF of the<br/>syntonic comma that&apos;s eliminated by the 4th tempered fifth.  I don&apos;t<br/>believe that is anyplace in your dictionary or webpage, and it made<br/>things a *lot* clearer for me.</p><p>*Of course* I had heard that &quot;meantone&quot; was the placing of the tone<br/>in between, or 1/2 way between the other D tones, but I never<br/>understood why it was 1/2 way before...</p><p>I think that would be a nice addition to your dictionary pages, since<br/>it made it so clear for *me.*</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>_______ _______ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrosn</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>8/13/2001 2:30:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In posting 26957  Re: nutty professor has me confused (JI)-<br/>I added a relevant P.S., which I repeat here in this thread for your<br/>convenience, as an additional note on the meantone nomenclature, since<br/>the D is not only the mean between two possible pitches tuned justly<br/>to the JI G and A, but the meantone G and A are also MEANS between<br/>two pitches tuned to the meantone D and C and E respectively (which<br/>latter are the same in either JI or meantone):</p><p>P.S. Concerning the derivation of the name &quot;meantone&quot; for this<br/>temperament, please note this interesting observation for the most<br/>elegantly simple version, the quarter-comma. Since the comma division<br/>is symmetrical around D in this tuning (assuming C-based tuning), the<br/>temperament for D should be set first. After tuning C and E as a just<br/>5:4 M3, you can set the temperament for D by:</p><p>1) tuning A a Perfect 4th above E (and consequently a just M6 above C<br/>if you want to double check)</p><p>2) tuning G a Perfect 5th above C</p><p>3) tuning D a Perfect 5th below the just A</p><p>4) play the D against the just G (it will be flat to the G by a<br/>synontic comma)</p><p>5) Observe the beat rate</p><p>6) Raise the D till the beat rate is half the initial rate</p><p>This sets the tempered D. Now the two remaining tempered core<br/>pitches, G and A, are tuned as mean pitches between C and D, then D<br/>and E respectively, by an analogous procedure.</p><p>*!*!*!*!*!*!  NOTE THE FOLLOWING: All three notes are tempered as<br/>MEANS between two pitches, and not just the D. All other pitches from<br/>Eb to G#, or wherever else you want to place the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth<br/>(actually a diminished 6th or its inversion, an augmented 3rd), can<br/>be tuned as just 5:4 Major 3rds to these core pitches.</p><p>This simplest and most elegantly symmetrical mother of all the other<br/>meantone temperaments has two difficulites beyond the limits it<br/>imposes on harmonic modulation:</p><p>1) Unlike 12-EDO, it does not order the degree of pitch error to<br/>align with the order of the intervalic primes. In ET, the fifths are<br/>almost just, the Major 3rds next (as bad as they may be), etc., so<br/>the most dissonant intervals are also the least accurate. Quarter-<br/>comma meantone has the fifths more than twice as mistuned as ET, but<br/>Major 3rds are perfect, inverting the order of primacy for the<br/>intervals.</p><p>2) Further, quarter-comma has diatonic half-steps 5.5 cents wider<br/>than the already fat (to modern ears) diatonic half-steps of JI. The<br/>narrow chromatic half-steps of JI are further narrowed by 5.5 cents.<br/>This has mostly a melodic significance, but not a completely<br/>negligible one.</p><p>These weaknesses seem to have bothered some quarter-comma users<br/>enough to seek other variants of meantone, many of which did little<br/>or nothing to extend the range of clean modulations, but rather<br/>shifted some of the pitch error of the perfect 5ths and minor 3rds to<br/>the Major 3rds, narrowing the diatonic half-steps and widening the<br/>chromatic half-steps in the bargain.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26916">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26916</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (( Light goes on ))<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So that&apos;s why it&apos;s called meantone????!!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow; thanks Graham.
