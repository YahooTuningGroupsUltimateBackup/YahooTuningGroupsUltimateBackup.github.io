Unless you define<br/>this solely as brevity or conciseness, isn&apos;t this another form of the &quot;warm<br/>fuzzy feeling&quot; that was mentioned recently? So, a JI guitar would be<br/>&quot;elegant&quot; because the acoustics of the vibrating string is reflected in the<br/>tuning. Thats what I was trying to express when I said it gives me a &quot;warm<br/>fuzzy feeling&quot;. I believe in mathematics, &quot;elegance&quot; is a real component of<br/>what makes a good proof, or at least an aesthetically attractive proof.<br/>Tuning theory is not about &quot;proofs&quot; but it certainly is about aesthetics.</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3>Paul H.
