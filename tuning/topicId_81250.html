Now, if I shrink it in the frequency domain to<br/>scale-factor zero, it will all be on the same note (whichever one I<br/>want it to be)... but any scale-factor larger than that will give me<br/>variations within the note with most of them being microtonal.</p><p>Before I start experimenting with this, though, I&apos;m wondering what<br/>some interesting ways to work out a &quot;good&quot; scale-factor for the<br/>shrink-down in the frequency domain would be.  Any thoughts?</p><p>Cheers!<br/>~af~</p></div><h3><a id=81273 href="#81273">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2009 9:37:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>LOL<br/>Really curious to hear this when it&apos;s finished :)</p><p>When you srink all the notes to one note and the use that as an instrument,<br/>I think the best scale by far would be the natural harmonic overtone series.<br/>So 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 6/1 7/1 etc (and maybe put a filter and envelope on<br/>that etc)<br/>That way it&apos;ll probably sound like a sound with a pitch and not noise<br/>(though not much left of the original notes, but it seems like you&apos;ve made<br/>sure of that allready :)<br/>Then play the piece with the new sound in 12tet or a tempered tuning (or the<br/>harmonnics series again for fun :)</p><p>Chears,<br/>Marcel</p><p>&gt; Before I start experimenting with this, though, I&apos;m wondering what<br/>&gt; some interesting ways to work out a &quot;good&quot; scale-factor for the<br/>&gt; shrink-down in the frequency domain would be.
