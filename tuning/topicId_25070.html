Just teasing:)</p><p>Sad, :-(</p><p>Yes, makes a lot of sense.

The film, a wonderful enthnomusicology<br/>achievement, was made by Swiss scholar Hugo Zemp.  As I recall the 7 was<br/>equal, and it was tuned by setting up the smallest interval of the scale as<br/>something to refer to on a bamboo tube that was pre-cut.  The music is fun,<br/>with several people joining in, demonstrating the harmonic qualities that the<br/>tuning offers.</p><p>I&apos;ve been to Thai restaurants that have xylophones in equal -7.  Other<br/>examples of 7 (more equal than non- as in Cambodia), include the some of<br/>Central Africa (Cameroun-mayble a bit less than equal), and as I&apos;ve been<br/>told...the Puna of Panama (which I have not had the opportunity to hear).</p><p>My piece &quot;MIllennium&quot; uses 7-tET (for violin, tenor sax, and bassoon) as does<br/>a section from my string quartet (&quot;Cosmic Rays&quot; where it is mixed with 5 and<br/>11 ets, isometrically), in my bassoon solo &quot;Zanzibar&quot; (where I improvise in<br/>the tuning), and in my symphony (&quot;Middle-earth&quot;) in the strings.</p><p>7-tET is a great tuning.  I have not recognized the &quot;whys&quot; for this yet and<br/>am reading what is said about it with great interest.  My fingerings for<br/>bassoon and saxophone (by Steve Kaufman) are published in PITCH I:4.  It is a<br/>very enjoyable tuning with a respectful body of work.</p><p>Clem Fortuna in Michigan has a nice 7-tET string quartet.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
