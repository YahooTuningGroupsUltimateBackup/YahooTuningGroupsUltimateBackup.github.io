Just to the over all idea -<br/>what the models are all about.</p><p>The idea of these scales is that you have a note at every vertex of a geometrcial<br/>shape such as an octahedron (double square pyramid).</p><p>Then each edge can play the notes for the two vertices<br/>it joins, as a diad. Each face can play a triad, for the three notes<br/>at its corners. Some of the models have tetrahedra two (triangular pyramids)<br/>- which play tetrads for the four notes at the four vertices vertices.</p><p>Then the notes are chosen so that the triads are all pure and consonant just triads<br/>and then as you move from one face triad to the next, since the faces share an<br/>edge, this means the triads share a diad and only differ in one note.</p><p>So you get these visual geometries and the geometrical shapes you see<br/>actually show the connections between the triads you hear when you click<br/>on the faces - a wonderful kind of synthesis of geometry and music.</p><p>So one can think of it as a kind of musical abstract sculpture.<br/>Pieces get composed in them too - Kraig Grady has done a lot of<br/>work in these scales.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
