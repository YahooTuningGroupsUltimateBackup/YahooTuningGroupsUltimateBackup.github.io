Only<br/>&gt;&gt; B is missing. I still need to work on the split digitals bugs for manuals<br/>&gt;&gt; two and three. The just-intonation tuning sounds wonderful! One changes<br/>&gt;&gt; manuals from one phrase to another as needed. I&apos;m in the process of<br/>&gt;&gt; scoring my eHymnal for Just temperament.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Here&apos;s what I wrote another:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Tonight I worked on scoring my organ eHymnal for just intonation. It&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; easier than I thought. And needs the split digitals less than I<br/>&gt;&gt; thought--just by playing on the right keyboard tuned to the right key.<br/>&gt;&gt; Sometimes only one keyboard and tuning is nneeded, more often two,<br/>&gt;&gt; occasionally three. The tuning part for a hymn in C looks like this as an<br/>&gt;&gt; example:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Manual/Tune<br/>&gt;&gt; I-G, II-C, III-F<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; When more than one keyboard is used, I have to add which keyboard to use<br/>&gt;&gt; at the music beginning and before or after the lines per phrases as<br/>&gt;&gt; needed.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Pauline<br/>&gt;</p></div>
