Well, in the really old days it was pencil and staff paper. But in the early days of home computers, everything was done with ASCII text files. I mainly used a program called MUS-X1, which represented the basic musical events with letters, numbers, and punctuation symbols. To get a quarter note Middle C, you&apos;d simply type &quot;Q4C&quot;. Since the letters A-G were reserved for musical notes, eighth notes were represented by &quot;O&quot; instead of &quot;E&quot;. Then a period was added for dotted notes: &quot;O.3A&quot; for a dotted eighth note A below middle C, and the symbols + and - for sharps and flats. You could specify key signatures and time signatures. It really was fairly easy to read and edit for the most part, and way faster to type than adding notes to a piano roll these days.</p><p>There really are two drawbacks with that kind of system, which is why I haven&apos;t done much looking at modern day equivalents like abc notation. One is that rhythms are limited to exact beats or fractions of a beat; this can be expanded by tying notes together, but it gets cumbersome to do things like casual &quot;swing&quot; rhythms or natural variations in timing. The other is that expression is difficult to add. MIDI at least gives you velocity sensitivity and continuous controllers.</p><p>On the other hand, the advantage over a piano roll is that you can work with complex notation systems without getting lost. If you&apos;re working with 171-ET and you need an interval of 100 steps, you don&apos;t have to physically count 100 steps between the notes! For reasons like that, I&apos;ve occasionally thought about defining some kind of microtonal score language. It would take time to write a program that could translate that into something usable for music, but it might be worth the effort if it saves time in actually writing the music.</p><p>What sorts of notation systems like that are available, and how adaptable are they for use with user-defined tunings of any size? You&apos;d pretty much need software that would let you start at any point in the score and play/render the music starting from that point, so you can hear the results immediately as you&apos;re editing.

What you&apos;re talking about is more for computer music control.

Thus, for example, i find<br/>it *very* easy to work in the 31-tone chain of 1/6-comma<br/>meantone -- you get used to the fact that, say, F# is the<br/>skinny note that appears between two fat ones. (Which note<br/>actually appears in that skinny space depends on which<br/>note, i.e. letter-name, you chose for your origin.)

Way faster to type, for one thing. Melodic lines and harmonic progressions can be organized in a way that&apos;s easier to follow. It corresponds more closely to what you would see in a notated score.</p><p>The basic idea behind the notation is that there are reasonable defaults for anything that gets left out. So if you&apos;ve got a melodic line, where the next note starts as soon as the current one ends, you don&apos;t need to specify when the next note starts. If you have a series of notes all of the same duration, you don&apos;t have to specify the duration each time. You could type a score consisting of a single letter &quot;C&quot;, and expect a reasonable result from that. If you don&apos;t specify a tuning, you get 12-ET. :-( Okay, maybe 1/6-comma meantone. :-)</p><p>&gt; You get some abstraction, which might be useful<br/>&gt; (Scala does timing numerically) but it looks a<br/>&gt; bit of a mess and does nothing for tuning, which<br/>&gt; for our purposes makes it useless.</p><p>You could always add white space to line up the notes if it gets confusing.</p><p>q3B          e.B=       s4C qC#        ;<br/>q [3F 4D F]. [3G 4E G].     [3A 4F A]. ;<br/>q [1B 2B].   [1A 2A].       [1F 2F].   |</p><p>Tuning would be set the same way as in a Scala seq file, by defining the notation system.</p><p>&lt;notation &quot;lemba&quot;&gt; q4I# eR_5D qU eN#_N | qU hD qT | hU er D_4R#_R | h.5D</p><p>There&apos;s no reason you can&apos;t type one note per line with this system if that&apos;s really what you want. Instead of just setting the time at the start of each measure, you could set it separately for each note. You could set all of the parameters explicitly for each note.</p><p>1:01:000 p q  3 Bb  ! time, dynamic, duration, octave, note + acc.<br/>1:02:000 p e. 3 B=<br/>1:02:180 p s  4 C=<br/>1:03:000 p q  4 C#</p><p>You could get even closer to raw MIDI by substituting &lt;velocity 40&gt; for each &quot;p&quot; and &lt;duration 240&gt; for each &quot;q&quot; (assuming the same time standard as used by Scala). Why not even use MIDI note numbers?</p><p>1:01:000 &lt;vel 40&gt; &lt;dur 240&gt; &lt;note 58&gt;<br/>1:02:000 &lt;vel 40&gt; &lt;dur 180&gt; &lt;note 59&gt;<br/>1:02:180 &lt;vel 40&gt; &lt;dur 60&gt;  &lt;note 60&gt;<br/>1:03:000 &lt;vel 40&gt; &lt;dur 240&gt; &lt;note 61&gt;</p><p>But this really gets tedious, and it&apos;s practically essential to have a shorter way to notate this. Also, it would be nice to define units in a way that&apos;s more friendly to musicians than MIDI. So rather than &lt;dur 240&gt;, which doesn&apos;t mean anything, something like &lt;dur 1/4&gt; for a quarter note would be far easier to understand. Alternatively, &lt;dur 1.0&gt; for one beat. (It&apos;s decisions like that, which could reasonably go either way, that I got hung up on when trying to define the notation.)</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2007 8:29:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Way faster to type, for one thing.</p><p>Not if your real composing has been on another<br/>program, and you are using the score to listen<br/>to however far you&apos;ve gotten.

Well, you started out by saying that &quot;Much too much<br/>of the stuff out there is music-unfriendly.&quot; From that, I assumed that you were looking for something a little more music-friendly. What it sounds like is you&apos;ve got some kind of algorithmic composition thing going on, but you need a way to get sounds out of your lists of numbers. In that specific case, I don&apos;t see how a more music-friendly notation scheme will do much good..... Maybe I&apos;m missing something.....</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2007 11:10:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Maybe I&apos;m missing something.....</p><p>You aren&apos;t.
