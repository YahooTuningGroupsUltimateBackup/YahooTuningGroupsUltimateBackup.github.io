I remember you that I try to play just intonation on my violin with<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; help of combination tones. Then I try to do those chords with the<br/>&gt; following intonation :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Major chords (&quot;4-5-6&quot;) :<br/>&gt; Chords numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27 and<br/>&gt; 28.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dominant chords (&quot;4-5-6-7&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;6 (&quot;7-8-12&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;8 (&quot;3-4-7&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;14 (&quot;3-4-7&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;18 (&quot;3-4-7&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;20 (&quot;4-7-10&quot;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Minor chords (&quot;16-19-24&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;10 (&quot;19-24-32&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;11 (&quot;12-19-32&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;24 (&quot;8-12-19&quot;)<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;25 (&quot;16-19-24&quot;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chords with difficulties :<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;2 : for me it isn&apos;t a real minor chord, just a &quot;passing chord&quot;. I<br/>&gt; think it&apos;s better that both b and both G are really equal, then this<br/>&gt; chord is rather a &quot;10-12-15&quot; (here : &quot;6-10-15&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;13 : it&apos;s really a minor chord (then &quot;16-19-24&quot;) but on the violin<br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; must use G string, then it&apos;s a &quot;pythagorean chord&quot; &quot;27-32-54&quot; (here :<br/>&gt; &quot;32-54-108&quot;... ;-)  yes it&apos;s possible to play it because of the 3<br/>&gt; fifth<br/>&gt; of a violin! ).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;23 : this chord is quite difficult. I try to play 9th minor dominant<br/>&gt; (&quot;8-10-12-14-17&quot;)<br/>&gt; (here : &quot;10-17-28&quot;), but here combination tones can&apos;t help me. If I<br/>&gt; play<br/>&gt; a b (on A string) instead of c it&apos;s easier (then it&apos;s &quot;5-8-14&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Problem of the modulations :<br/>&gt; Chord n&iuml;&iquest;&half; 9 to n&iuml;&iquest;&half;10, the e (n&iuml;&iquest;&half;10) is one comma (81/80) of the e of 2nd<br/>&gt; chord. On a violin it&apos;s because of the whole strings but I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; the good choice : then the D of 15th chord is really in tune with<br/>&gt; whole<br/>&gt; string.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19 to 20 : no problem... d-e is like 8-9. Both d are differents but...<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a modulation...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a violin, those chords involve the following singularities :<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;1 : the b is out of tune with E string (4th 27/20).<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;2 : the e     //              A   //       //     .<br/>&gt; n&iuml;&iquest;&half;8 : the c made a 9/7 3rd with E string<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, I don&apos;t write just on minor chord, but, for me it&apos;s difficult<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; speak of a chord without a real context. (I know that here it&apos;sn&apos;t a<br/>&gt; real score, just an exercise...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Xavier</p></div><h3><a id=14432 href="#14432">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Here&apos;s the challenge: the tuning file format I currently<br/>use presents a self-consistent tuning (meaning, each pitch class is<br/>given a tuning offset from 12-tET, with all intervals implied<br/>therefrom); how would one tune all 12 pitch classes in a way that would<br/>prominently feature minor chord(s) tuned 16:19:24 and also handle other<br/>chords in a reasonable way?

Especially for the Scarlatti, where you<br/>&gt;essentially got meantone, all the melodic whole tones would be about<br/>&gt;equal -- thus a high degree of melodic smoothness.</p><p>How big is your wallet, Paul?  ;-&gt;  Actually, at the moment, I&apos;m trying<br/>to recall which piece seemed to whap me in the face with this.  I&apos;ll get<br/>back to you when possible; you can keep the contents of your wallet.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;So, for example, a 7-limit otonal tuning file would start by<br/>&gt;&gt;specifying that C is unchanged from 12-tET, E is about -14 cents from<br/>&gt;&gt;12-tET, G is about +2 cents from 12-tET, and Bb is about -31 cents<br/>&gt;&gt;from 12-tET (the program will separately &quot;center&quot; the deviations given<br/>&gt;&gt;it).  In order to capture minor chords, the file tunes A at about -16<br/>&gt;&gt;cents from 12-tET.  I think I also tune Eb at +16, allowing a good<br/>&gt;&gt;C,Eb,G as well as A,C,E; they will give the same tuning results.</p><p>&gt;&gt;The program understands that each tuning file can be applied in 12<br/>&gt;&gt;keys.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;uhh . . . right . . . .</p><p>What&apos;s with the &quot;uhh&quot;?  This seems so intuitive to me; how am I failing<br/>to convey the idea(s) here?</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;To steer a given set of notes into a particular tuning vs. another,<br/>&gt;&gt;the tuning file rates each of the 66 intervals it forms; thus the<br/>&gt;&gt;above file would rate the 386 cent interval from C to E as very<br/>&gt;&gt;desirable, etc.  The backside major third, from E to G#, is<br/>&gt;&gt;approximately 428 cents and is given very low desirability.  The 7:9<br/>&gt;&gt;third from Bb to D, approx 435 cents, is given fairly high<br/>&gt;&gt;desirability so that a dom 7 will align to it, but not so high that a<br/>&gt;&gt;bare major third sticks to it instead of to 5:4.</p><p>(I meant dom 9, not dom 7)</p><p>&gt;&gt;The numbers I use for interval desirability are completely seat of the<br/>&gt;&gt;pants; when the program makes a bad choice, often the problem can be<br/>&gt;&gt;fixed by changing interval desirability in one or more tuning files to<br/>&gt;&gt;steer the tuning some other way than it was going.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not sure you explained what interval desirability does. Does the<br/>&gt;program determine which tuning file maximizes the desirability at each<br/>&gt;moment of the piece, and use that tuning file?</p><p>Yes.  By summing the weighted &quot;goodness&quot; of all the dyadic intervals,<br/>much as your dyadic harmonic entropy calculations do.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;&gt;And what about your recent development to allow the intervallic<br/>&gt;&gt;springs to compete with one another in the case of a stack-of-fifths<br/>&gt;&gt;chord, etc.? Does that do away with tuning files?</p><p>Partially; it jumps in ONLY when the previous logic has specified<br/>12-tET.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;The process starts by assigning a best tuning to each small period of<br/>&gt;&gt;time with a consistent set of notes.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;That sounds like a yes to my question above. But what exactly is a<br/>&gt;&quot;small period of time&quot;?</p><p>A period when there are no notes on or notes off.  However, in what I<br/>consider to be a very important refinement possible only with &quot;leisure&quot;<br/>retuning, I do create &quot;pseudo-simultaneous events&quot; (PSE&apos;s) which for<br/>the purposes of modelling compress small transition times together,<br/>times when typically some notes end and others begin.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Now in the tuning file you mention above, I can&apos;t see why you would<br/>&gt;want to have Eb at +16. The tuning file will evidently be applied only<br/>&gt;in dominant situations, using 4:5:6:7 for a C dominant seventh chord;<br/>&gt;so shouldn&apos;t the Eb be a 7/3 or -33?</p><p>Perhaps it should.  I haven&apos;t thought about that permutation.  It&apos;s true<br/>that redundancy in the provision for minor chords is not necessary.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Maybe if we think through this we can figure out a way to eliminate<br/>&gt;tuning files altogether.</p><p>Yes, we might!  And, as I&apos;ve said before, the continuous function<br/>represented by your harmonic entropy graphs is appealing to me as a<br/>tool to move toward that goal.   The problem is the &quot;traps&quot;: the<br/>question of how to get past local minima that hide better minima nearby.<br/>My current methods, messy though they are, have a rough-and-ready<br/>approach for dealing with this challenge, and it may take a fair number<br/>of new techniques to navigate a consistently better path.  Better<br/>solutions will undoubtedly come in time.  It&apos;s wide open.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
