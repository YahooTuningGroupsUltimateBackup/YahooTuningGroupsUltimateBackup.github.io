I understand how to do what I<br/>started out on now, with the next step being finding the most (and then<br/>progressively less) consonant &quot;scales&quot; for each of the different types of<br/>chord.  A few of the easiest examples:</p><p>MM7    1  5/4  3/2  15/8<br/>mm7     1  6/5  3/2  9/5</p><p>In this light I understand John Link&apos;s use of (the dominant 7th of a major<br/>scale as in his previous example)</p><p>Mm7    1  5/4  3/2  7/4</p><p>as the most consonant.  I&apos;m not saying this is the most desirable to use in<br/>all dominant 7th situations, only that it seems to be the most consonant<br/>chord taken in total isolation. Thus the desire for listing further, less<br/>consonant (in some sort of rough, increasingly dissonant order) for each<br/>chord type, such as Paul Ehrlich&apos;s use of 9/5 or 16/9 for the 7th in the<br/>above Mm7.</p><p>So, is</p><p>dd7     1  6/5   7/5  5/3</p><p>a good one?  Or is it significantly more consonant to have the smaller<br/>intervals to the 7th more consonant and the interval from the root to the<br/>7th less consonant?  I don&apos;t want to get into arguments about which is &quot;THE<br/>most consonant&quot; since, unless there&apos;s a precise (mathematical) definition of<br/>consonance there&apos;s no real way to decide the issue.  (Perhaps some weighted<br/>measure of beats, harmonic entropy, timbral aspects, etc., with different<br/>weights for different styles?)  Rather, I&apos;m interested in listing the main<br/>possibilities so it&apos;s easy to try the different possibilities out in<br/>different situations, with a rough ordering, or better yet a tag for each<br/>possibility indicating the style or context it&apos;s most appropriate for.</p><p>I want to extend this procedure to the various 9, 11, 13, 6 and whatever<br/>chords, until there is essentially a list of &quot;scales&quot; for each of the triad<br/>types, each scale in the list being labelled as to their properties, use,<br/>whatever.</p><p>I get the impression that John Link is doing something similar to this, no?<br/>Are there lists like this available - at least so I can check mywork against<br/>them to make sure I don&apos;t miss anything important, or is this an exercise<br/>for the student?   :)</p><p>Addendum re previous posts:</p><p>John and Paul:  Thanks for all the examples, etc.</p><p>Margo:  Thanks for the info on the major third wolf.  I knew there were<br/>various wolf intervals around, but had only specificaly read of a fifth<br/>wolf.  I found the actual uses of this major third wolf interesting, I&apos;ld<br/>gotten the impression before that people just stayed away from them.</p><p>Jim Savage</p></div><h3><a id=6151 href="#6151">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

In this case, you have</p><p>6:5  7:5  5:3  7:6  25:18  25:21</p><p>The last two ratios are complex and are formed by the 5/3. So the 5/3 would<br/>not be too stable and might want to move, but where? Say you move it to<br/>(6/5)*(7/5)=42/25. The chord is now</p><p>dd7     1/1  6/5  7/5  42/25</p><p>Then the list of intervals becomes</p><p>6:5  7:5  42:25  7:6  7:5  6:5</p><p>This may be an improvement in some timbres, but in others the best way to<br/>minimize roughness may be to tune the diminshed seventh chord to something<br/>very close to 12-tET (or 4-tET). This is because in many timbres a<br/>16-cent-out-of-tune 6:5 is still less rough than a pure 7:6 (remember that<br/>the critical bandwidth kicks in at about 7:6 in most registers).</p><p>But if you&apos;re considering the combination tone/virtual pitch components of<br/>consonance,</p><p>dd7     1/1  6/5  7/5  17/10</p><p>is by far the best, since it&apos;s just harmonics 10, 12, 14, and 17 over a<br/>common fundamental (while the last two JI options come out as 15:18:21:25<br/>and 25:30:35:42, respectively) and there seems to be a real drop in our<br/>ability to understand high harmonics somewhere between 17 and 25.</p></div>
