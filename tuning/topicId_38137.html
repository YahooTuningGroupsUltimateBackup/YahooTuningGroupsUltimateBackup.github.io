I &gt; appreciate your<br/>&gt; comments, and want to respond to some of them:</p><p>The same from me. I got caught up in personal stuff mostly, plus a little football, so much has been neglected over the past couple of weeks. So with apologies to everyone, I&apos;ll just clear out my outbox, or rather the draft box.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Toward an understanding of expanded equal temperament&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If you are not particularly interested in, or will not be<br/>&gt;&gt; dwelling on, the harmonic series (JI) related properties of the<br/>&gt;&gt; 72 tone scale that is the focus of your thesis, then it should<br/>&gt;&gt; not be called a temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why?</p><p>Temperament is quite clearly defined in it&apos;s purpose, primarily modulation. It&apos;s provenance is the Latin &quot;Temperamentum&quot;, meaning &quot;right proportion, middle way, mean, moderation&quot;.</p><p>Rick Tagawa has a page at &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/tagawa/72edo.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/tagawa/72edo.htm</a>&gt;, dealing in the most part with 72 Equal Divisions of 2:1. There is a definition of temperament at the top taken from the Harvard Dictionary of Music.</p><p>The same page used to have quotes from Daniel Wolf, from the Tuning List,</p><p>&quot;Joe Manieri teaches 72-tone equal temperament at New England Conservatory without any regard to its excellent approximations of simple-integer ratios. This, essentially, is the same approach taken by Carrillo, Haba and Wyschnegradsky in an earlier generation or by Ferneyhough &amp; Co. nowadays: the use of microtones to create a highly inflected musical surface. One of Partch&apos;s initial impulses, to accurately represent the inflections of a speaking voice was not unrelated to this view.&quot;</p><p>and</p><p>&quot;The alternative approach, whose pioneers were Lourie, Novaro, Partch (slightly later), Fokker, and Wilson, is probably more central to the interests of the tuning list membership, is certainly a deeper view of musical materials, but one which does not automatically dismiss the other aesthetic. &quot;</p><p>It would appear that some here fail to recognise the fine distinction between these two aesthetic aims and their modus operandi.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;The author concludes that just intonation and exotic tunings do<br/>&gt;&gt; not provide convincing rationales for microtonal composition,<br/>&gt;&gt; while a simple creative impulse to add pitches does, and that<br/>&gt;&gt; only a fully functional microtonal equal temperament (the third<br/>&gt;&gt; of the three methods) enables the composer to develop a<br/>&gt;&gt; genuinely microtonal music.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I suspect this is the bit that rattled a lot of nerves. If it<br/>&gt;&gt; went something along the lines of &quot;in the author&apos;s personal<br/>&gt;&gt; opinion and within the subject of this thesis&quot;, then it may make<br/>&gt;&gt; more sense. Even then however, to state that you *conclude* that<br/>&gt;&gt; nothing else makes for a &quot;genuinely&quot; microtonal music, is still,<br/>&gt;&gt; well, bizarre. Therefore, and with reference to the rest of the<br/>&gt;&gt; abstract and your responses on this list, I think the above one<br/>&gt;&gt; statement just needs to be reworded, because I can sense what<br/>&gt;&gt; you&apos;re trying to say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I&apos;m sure it rattled nerves, and I can understand why some &gt; people would react<br/>&gt; as Carl Lumma did. (He called it rubbish.)</p><p>I was surprised at Carl&apos;s reaction and presumed it to be in jest. Especially directly following my suggestion (confirmed by you) of what may have really happened with the semantics there.</p><p>&gt;  Just know that, although this does<br/>&gt; express the gist of my message, it is expresses it in a very &gt; crude, even obnoxios<br/>&gt; manner because of the context in which is was written.</p><p>Understood.</p><p>&gt;  It is an excerpt from the<br/>&gt; abstract to my thesis. The abstract was one of the last touches &gt; before submitting<br/>&gt; the final draft, and it was necessay to distill all the points &gt; of the dissertation into X<br/>&gt; number of words. The result was a very crude, dry language &gt; (even drier than the<br/>&gt; thesis itself), intended for little more than archiving &gt; purposes in my mind.</p><p>I suspect you may have since considered putting more thought into abstracts ! Personally I think the process of writing an essay should begin with an abstract of some sort - a statement of purpose, which can be continually refined to produce a fair account for the essay&apos;s prospective audience.</p><p>&gt;  Although<br/>&gt; I knew this document was accessible to the public, what I &gt; really intended for<br/>&gt; &quot;general consumption,&quot; as I&apos;ve explained here before, was the &gt; PNM essay.</p><p>Understood.</p><p>&gt;  Even if<br/>&gt; one disagrees with my points, one would have to admit that they &gt; are not worded in<br/>&gt; such an abrasive manner in PNM. (E.g. Where I outline my points in the<br/>&gt; introduction, I just state that the &quot;simply adding pitches&quot; &gt; approach &quot;has several<br/>&gt; advantages over&quot; the &quot;pure tuning&quot; approach. That shouldn&apos;t be &gt; as annoying, I&apos;d<br/>&gt; think, especially if one recognizes that it is presented as opinion.)</p><p>Also understood. As I suspect it is by others - there are potentially 500+ people reading all this.</p><p>&gt; So, don&apos;t mistake the abstract for the paper itself,<br/>It would be an unfortunate assumption, especially if the abstract was flawed.</p><p>&gt; and, person-to-person, if you<br/>&gt; want to read what I consider the better-written expression of &gt; my views, try the<br/>&gt; PNM version.</p><p>I will, in time.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;From these points the author derives further that a microtonal<br/>&gt;&gt; technique must be based on careful voice-leading in general...&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes ! And I hope more scholarship explores this sort of<br/>&gt;&gt; practical matter for the practicing musician.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder what you&apos;d have to say about Part 2 of my essay &gt; (either thesis or PNM)<br/>&gt; in which I discuss this at great length. Also, you might like &gt; to see Joe Maneri&apos;s and<br/>&gt; Scott Van Duyne&apos;s book, &quot;Preliminary Studies in the Virtual &gt; Pitch Continuum,&quot;<br/>&gt; even though it is not written with pure tuning in mind.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;The paper concludes with speculation about the applicability of<br/>&gt;&gt; serial techniques, as well as the inherent atonality of this<br/>&gt;&gt; music.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In spite of the term &quot;atonal&quot; being taken for granted almost<br/>&gt;&gt; universally, particularly with academia, I have to say that I<br/>&gt;&gt; long shared the sentiments in a Monzo post from Jan 2001 (Tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; Digest 1029), &quot;Schoenberg very logically argued (as he always<br/>&gt;&gt; did) that since the very substance of music was &quot;tone&quot;, then<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;atonal&quot; was an oxymoron and could not describe anything having<br/>&gt;&gt; to do with music.&quot; and &quot;...what Schoenberg clearly wanted to do<br/>&gt;&gt; was to *expand* tonality&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree whole-heartedly with this. I can&apos;t stand the word, &gt; especially since it&apos;s so<br/>&gt; misleading, and makes what for some is a &quot;positive&quot; creative &gt; state of being seem<br/>&gt; negative. But I chose to use it because it seems to be common &gt; usage. I did wince<br/>&gt; everytime I wrote it.</p><p>:) Common usage does not necessarily mean correct usage ! I see you&apos;re not afraid to challenge opinions in the microtonal community, so why stop there ?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I&apos;d also like to add that &quot;non-Western musical traditions&quot; are<br/>&gt;&gt; just as (&amp; often times more) closed-minded than *western* ones.<br/>&gt;&gt; Microtonality as we here are interested in (I hope), as<br/>&gt;&gt; adventurers &amp; explorers, is a universal phenomenon. We seek what<br/>&gt;&gt; is outside convention, however subjective that may be to our<br/>&gt;&gt; personal existence. In Thailand, Thai music is just called music.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Several times did I begin &amp; delete this e-mail, not certain if<br/>&gt;&gt; it would be worth your time<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for sending your thoughts.</p><p>It is *nice*, to say the least, to be able to exchange thoughts with the calibre of people here.</p><p>&gt; -Julia<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cheers !<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=38142 href="#38142">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2002 1:24:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Bob, Carl, all !</p><p>I&apos;m always surprised when anything I&apos;ve said seems to make sense to someone.</p><p>&gt; &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rwendell@cangelic.org">rwendell@cangelic.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you, Joel.

It is 72EDO we are discussing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right you are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You have a point in writing about &quot;a belief in just intonation&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt; The very term *Just* Intonation is fraught with ideology. I<br/>&gt;&gt; would submit that the pitches it is used to refer to would be<br/>&gt;&gt; better called by what they are, notes within the harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt; series. So, instead of saying &quot;11-limit JI&quot;, I would use &quot;the<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic series to the 11-limit&quot;. Perhaps something like<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;11HSL&quot;, where HSL = Harmonic Series Limit, would be useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;11-limit JI&quot; will do just fine.  Anyone who uses a term and<br/>&gt; then turns around to bash it for &apos;associated ideology&apos; is taking<br/>&gt; a cheap shot indeed.</p><p>I&apos;m not bashing it. I was well aware of using the term &quot;JI&quot; at the start of my post when I wrote, &quot;...the harmonic series (JI) related...&quot;. It was intentional as I was yet to get to the part suggesting something wrong with the term &quot;Just Intonation&quot;. By the same token, I&apos;m not trying to impose a view on anyone, so you are obviously free to use whatever term you please. I find the term &quot;Just Intonation&quot; problematic. It doesn&apos;t work for me. I find it lacking &amp; limiting, and so am looking for a more effective approach.</p><p>&gt;&gt; However, things change.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And nobody knows why.  It&apos;s true.  Certainly Bach had nothing to<br/>&gt; do with 12 tones being selected over 31, as Paul suggested.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &quot;The author concludes that just intonation and exotic tunings do<br/>&gt;&gt; not provide convincing rationales for microtonal composition,<br/>&gt;&gt; while a simple creative impulse to add pitches does, and that<br/>&gt;&gt; only a fully functional microtonal equal temperament (the third<br/>&gt;&gt; of the three methods) enables the composer to develop a<br/>&gt;&gt; genuinely microtonal music.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who wrote this rubbish, and why is it in my mailbox?</p><p>You jest, no ?

(Actually, I didn&apos;t mention Ferneyhough,<br/>but mentioned Penderecki, Xenakis and Ligeti). But I have to add here that if one<br/>reads my essay, one will also see that the approach of Carrillo, Haba,<br/>Wyshegradsky and Maneri (and a few others, including myself) is really not at all<br/>the same, is fundamentally different from that of Ferneyhough, whose use of<br/>microintervals - though certainly not other aspects of his music - probably has<br/>more in common with Xenakis, Penderecki, etc. In this latter group I would say<br/>that the characterization &quot;highly inflected musical surface&quot; applies. (This is in no<br/>way a value judgement about the music, only a description of their use of<br/>microintervals.)</p><p>For the former group, nothing could be further than the truth! (Almost...) In the<br/>essay I describe at great length how central the pitches, the microintervals, are to<br/>the music, thematically and structurally. There is nothing &quot;surface level&quot; about the<br/>microintervals. The fact that &quot;we&quot; do not compose according to the harmonic<br/>models that are relevent to JI and other pure tuning composers does not mean<br/>that our &quot;view of the musical materials&quot; is not as &quot;deep&quot; (as Daniel Wolf says) as<br/>the Partch, Fokker, etc. view. (In fact, some might even say it&apos;s deeper, but that<br/>becomes a matter of personal perspective.)</p><p>If it does interest you to see exactly how deeply the microintervals matter in this<br/>alternative approach, then I recommend reading the essay, if you ever have the<br/>time. (It might interest Daniel Wolf, too, to learn more facts about Joe Maneri&apos;s<br/>music and what he teaches his students.)</p><p>&gt; Common usage does not necessarily mean correct usage !

That reminds me of a business<br/>in which every job is stamped &quot;PRIORITY&quot;; if *everything* gets<br/>priority, then *nothing* gets priority.  So if all of the tones are<br/>at once equally entitled to be called tonal centers, then there is<br/>really no tonal center at all, hence &quot;atonality&quot;.</p><p>Trouble is, even if one chooses to ignore the principles of musical<br/>acoustics and mathematical relationships, they are still there.

Is this more likely to happen by<br/>pursuing an atonal or pantonal approach or by establishing an<br/>expanded harmonic vocabulary through the employment of intervals<br/>representing or approximating those found above the sixth harmonic<br/>(while reaffirming the traditional concept of tonality, including the<br/>principle of consonance and dissonance)?</p><p>Such is the rationale for advocating the approach to microtonality<br/>that I have taken.</p><p>That said, I should quickly add that the element of &quot;creative<br/>impulse&quot; (in whatever form) in a musical composition outweighs all of<br/>our theorizing.
