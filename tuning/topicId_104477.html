A Fokker tune is constructed as follows:</p><p>(1) Take all the rank two temperaments which temper the block to a MOS (for a given val making the block weakly epimorphic) and order them in terms of complexity from least to greatest.</p><p>(2) Take the scale in Scala form, so having 2/1 but not 1/1, and order it for each temperament in terms of that temperament. By this I mean if [periods, generators] is the Hermite-reduced mapping for the temperament, and if a and b are two intervals, then a&lt;b if generators(a)&lt;generators(b), and a&gt;b if generators(a)&gt;generators(b). If generators(a)=generators(b), then a&lt;b if periods(a)&lt;periods(b), and a&gt;b if periods(a)&gt;periods(b). If both periods and generators are equal you don&apos;t have a temperament for the block, but in general you can say a&lt;b if a&lt;b numerically, etc.</p><p>(3) Now take these orderings and turn them into a tune by traversing the orderings from least to most complex; I add timing information by using a longer time value when the next note moves by a generator rather than a period.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example: Carl Lumma&apos;s prism scale is an august-pajara-hexe-augene wakalix.

So, harmonically, Fokker blocks don&apos;t have to sound<br/>like much at all.</p><p>On the other hand, from a melodic scalar standpoint, what I find<br/>interesting is that they generalize MOS&apos;s in being melodically even,<br/>and in that you can move around from mode to mode (and from dome to<br/>dome) by displacing notes by a chroma, ending up with another Fokker<br/>block each time. Except in the rank &gt; 2 case, you have more than one<br/>chroma to deal with, which makes it more complex and beautiful in a<br/>certain way. That&apos;s just me, anyways.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
