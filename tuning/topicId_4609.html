In 1555, as others have already noted, Nicola Vicentino<br/>(1511-1576) proposed his _archicembalo_ based on 31-tet as a standard<br/>not only for new styles of keyboard music, but also for the intervals<br/>and consonances of vocal music.</p><p>Here I would like first to consider a generic concept equivalent to<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; in the 16th century (the term &quot;meantone&quot; itself being<br/>later), and then to consider how Vicentino deems 31-tet as synonymous<br/>with such a scheme, or more precisely, one manifestation of it.</p><p>--------------------------------------------<br/>1. Renaissance meantone -- or _participatio_<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>Because tertian just intonation (JI) is generally the Renaissance<br/>ideal for vocal music, and because it happens that two of the<br/>Renaissance temperaments now known as &quot;meantone&quot; (1/4-comma,<br/>1/3-comma) feature just major thirds at 5:4 or minor thirds at 6:5<br/>respectively, it may not be so surprising that meantone is sometimes<br/>conceived as a kind of subset of tertian JI. Specifically, the term<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; often tends to imply the 1/4-comma tuning with pure major<br/>thirds, if no other specification is given.</p><p>However, Mark Lindley has noted that early descriptions of what we<br/>would call &quot;meantone&quot; do not specify any mathematical quantity of<br/>temperament for the fifths, but rather sometimes mention more<br/>generally a property of _participatio_ or &quot;participation&quot; by which<br/>fifths are made slightly narrower than pure. Gaffurius (1496), for<br/>example, says that fifths are narrowed on the organ &quot;by a small and<br/>hidden amount&quot; -- that is, by an amount so small as not to be easily<br/>measured under a theory in which the comma tends to be the smallest<br/>recognized interval.</p><p>By 1555, this _participatio_ has become so accustomed -- having come<br/>into vogue perhaps a century or so earlier, around 1450, in the epoch<br/>of Conrad Paumann[1] -- that Vicentino treats is as one of the two basic<br/>attributes of &quot;modern&quot; practice. He describes the music of the time as<br/>&quot;mixed and tempered music,&quot; that is, music mixing the intervals of the<br/>different genera (diatonic, chromatic, enharmonic), and featuring a<br/>slight tempering or &quot;blunting&quot; of the fifth in order to make the<br/>thirds more concordant, in contrast with earlier Pythagorean tunings.</p><p>Vicentinoo remarks that the fifth is such an excellent concord that it<br/>pleases even when &quot;blunted&quot; or &quot;truncated&quot; in this way to improve the<br/>quality of the thirds, treated in &quot;modern&quot; music as full concords.</p><p>Thus if we are to seek a Renaissance equivalent of the meantone<br/>concept, it would be this concept of &quot;blunting&quot; the fifth. Indeed,<br/>Zarlino presents his archicembalo as a realization and further<br/>extension of this practice.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>2. Vicentino&apos;s meantone: 31-tet<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>As Lindley discusses, various shades of meantone were likely tuned in<br/>the 16th century, not necessarily involving pure major or minor<br/>thirds. Early instructions may give nonmathematical directions: &quot;Tune<br/>the fifths, narrowing them until they do not completely please you.&quot;<br/>Zarlino (1558) takes a more mathematical approach, discussing for<br/>example his 2/7-comma temperament (a compromise which &quot;splits the<br/>difference&quot; from tertian JI among major and minor thirds).</p><p>What these tunings share in common is, of course, what Vicentino calls<br/>the &quot;blunting&quot; of the fifth -- and he sees his own 31-tet as<br/>synonymous with this practice.</p><p>Thus in discussing the tuning of his archicembalo, he specifies that<br/>the first 12 notes should be tuned &quot;as the good tuners do it,&quot; duly<br/>blunting the fifths. Then the remaining chromatic and enharmonic notes<br/>are added by reference to these standard tones (the usual Eb-G#).</p><p>While Vicentino does not identify this usual 12-note tuning as<br/>1/4-comma meantone, in fact such a tuning (with pure major thirds)<br/>would be very close to 31-tet. In Vicentino terms, the identifying<br/>mark of his tuning is that a major semitone is equal to 3/5-tone, and<br/>a minor semitone to 2/5-tone, with 31 &quot;dieses&quot; of 1/5-tone being equal<br/>to an octave.</p><p>Thus Vicentino regards his tuning as both: (1) A tuning carried out<br/>according to the best standard practice, with the fifths &quot;blunted&quot; (in<br/>later terms, &quot;meantone&quot;); and (2) A tuning where 31 dieses of 1/5-tone<br/>each are equal to an octave (in later terms, &quot;31-tet&quot;).</p><p>-------------<br/>3. Conclusion<br/>-------------</p><p>One conclusion might be that at least to Vicentino, the categories of<br/>a &quot;blunted-fifths&quot; tuning and a tuning with semitones as precise<br/>fractional parts of the tone (major semitone as 3/5-tone, minor<br/>semitone as 2/5-tone) are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Some modern tuning theorists might consider &quot;meantones&quot; and &quot;n-tet&apos;s&quot;<br/>two distinct categories, and in fact this approach need not clash with<br/>Vicentino&apos;s, as long as we recognize that some tunings may fit in both<br/>categories. Thus 1/4-comma meantone is a meantone tuning which is also<br/>not (exactly) any n-tet; 12-tet is an n-tet which is outside the range<br/>of characteristic meantone (where thirds are within about 1/3-comma of<br/>pure); and 31-tet is also a meantone tuning.</p><p>Of course, the very close proximity of 1/4-comma and 31-tet may help<br/>in explaining why Vicentino directs that the first 12 steps be tuned<br/>in accordance with usual practice. Then, as now, the difference<br/>between a pure 5:4 at ~386.31 cents, and a 10/31 octave major third at<br/>~387.10 cents, may have been difficult to notice.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. This date of around 1450 marks the point at which a Pythagorean<br/>tuning was felt no longer to meet the needs of a vertical style<br/>treating thirds as more and more restful. It should be added that<br/>Vicentino and other 16th-century theorists were apparently familiar<br/>with Ancient Greek teachings regarding the Pythagorean concords<br/>(e.g. as transmitted by Boethius), but not necessarily with Gothic<br/>practice or theory (say 1200-1420), in which intervals such as the<br/>Pythagorean major third (81:64) are treated as pleasing but unstable<br/>&quot;semi-concords.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
