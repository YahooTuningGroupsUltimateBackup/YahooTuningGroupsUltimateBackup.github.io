Along the<br/>&gt; way, anybody who cares should wind up with at least one copy of this<br/>&gt; Rothenberg stuff that he can read and print with a clear conscience....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The model concerns a code that can be used to extract information from huge<br/>&gt; stimulus spaces despite the limitations of the human memory system...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         We have hypothesized that when a listener is presented with a series<br/>&gt;         of unfamiliar tonal stimuli, he must mentally construct a reference<br/>&gt;         frame, P, to which all such stimuli are referred.  Many proper P may<br/>&gt;         satisfy this requirement.  If the stimuli are sufficiently unfamiliar<br/>&gt;         (as when one listens to music of an alien culture) many repeated<br/>&gt;         hearings may be necessary during which a listener replaces a familiar<br/>&gt;         P with one more appropriate for classifying the stimuli heard.  The<br/>&gt;         cardinality of the constructed P will depend upon the numbers of<br/>&gt;         distinctions required by the particular musical language or, if the<br/>&gt;         stimuli are not musical, upon the fineness of discrimination required<br/>&gt;         by the recognition task to be performed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once an appropriate P has been found, the next step is to locate a stimulus<br/>&gt; within it...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Given any &quot;interval&quot; (pair) in P, the listener is able to recognize<br/>&gt;         the possible positions its elements might occupy in P.  In effect,<br/>&gt;         given any pair of elements he can mentally supply (interpolate) a<br/>&gt;         possible set of remaining elements of P which satisfy the equivalence<br/>&gt;         class and tuning he has learned.  Such an interpolation becomes unique<br/>&gt;         after a sufficient number of elements of P are heard.  This is<br/>&gt;         equivalent to the identification of x (key) in a give P(x).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         For example, the major triad [C E G] is not a sufficient subset of the<br/>&gt;         C-major scale since there are two other major scales (namely G and F)<br/>&gt;         in which it occurs.  But C-major is the only major scale which<br/>&gt;         contains the four notes [G B D F], so the &quot;dominant seventh chord&quot; is<br/>&gt;         a sufficient subset of C-major.  A minimal set is a sufficient set<br/>&gt;         with no sufficient subsets.  Thus, [G B D F] is not a minimal set, but<br/>&gt;         [G B F] is, as there is no major scale except C which contains [G B<br/>&gt;         F], while each of its proper subsets [G B] [G F] [B F] are included in<br/>&gt;         some other major scale (G, F, and F# respectively).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         It is straightforward to verify that sufficient (and therefore<br/>&gt;         minimal) sets are invariants of equivalence.  They depend only on the<br/>&gt;         equivalence class, not on the particular tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A measure is developed for this locating...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Consider a language whose alphabet consists of n letters (or<br/>&gt;         phonemes).  How many distinct words can be formed using this<br/>&gt;         alphabet?  Certain restrictions may exist which can limit the<br/>&gt;         sequences of letters that can occur.  The more distinct words that can<br/>&gt;         be formed whose length is less than or equal to some maximal value,<br/>&gt;         the more efficient the alphabet is said to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         A similar situation applies when &quot;words&quot; are formed from sequences of<br/>&gt;         intervals.  Since interval sequences are formed from tone sequences,<br/>&gt;         we consider sequences of the elements of some P.  Also, since no new<br/>&gt;         intervals are formed when an element is repeated, only non-repeating<br/>&gt;         sequences will be considered.  Since we are here concerned only with<br/>&gt;         properties deriving from the structure of P, we will use the following<br/>&gt;         criterion for the termination of a &quot;word&quot; (other criteria apply when<br/>&gt;         &quot;motifs&quot; are considered): When all remaining elements of P are<br/>&gt;         determined by a sequence of some of its elements, the addition of<br/>&gt;         elements will impart no further information of this type, and the<br/>&gt;         &quot;word&quot; will be considered terminated.  That is, any sequence will be<br/>&gt;         considered complete as soon as a sufficient set occurs in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         We now ask, given a particular equivalence class, how many distinct<br/>&gt;         words can be formed using k elements where k varies from 1 to n.<br/>&gt;         Consider all non-repeating sequences of n points (there are n! such<br/>&gt;         sequences).  Let S_i be the number of elements in each such sequence<br/>&gt;         which must appear before a sufficient set is encountered.  The F(P) is<br/>&gt;         defined as the average,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         n!<br/>&gt;         Sigma(S_i) / n!<br/>&gt;         i=1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         F(P) may be interpreted as the average number of elements in a non-<br/>&gt;         repeating sequence of n elements of P(x) required to determine the<br/>&gt;         key, x.  Efficiency, E, is defined as F(P)/n and Redundancy, R, as 1 -<br/>&gt;         F(P)/n.  Both numbers lie between 0 and 1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         It should be noted that this kind of efficiency and redundancy differs<br/>&gt;         from the meanings these terms assume in information theory.  The<br/>&gt;         distinction is important and applies to alphabets in spoken natural<br/>&gt;         languages as well as to musical scales.  The redundancy of information<br/>&gt;         theory refers to a redundancy in the message, not in the code.  In our<br/>&gt;         discussion here, that property of the code which determines whether<br/>&gt;         efficient messages _can_ be constructed (if such are desired) is<br/>&gt;         considered.  This property is inherent in the code itself, and does<br/>&gt;         not apply to the message.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rothenberg outlines six scenarios...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           Scale type  Stability    Efficiency<br/>&gt;         (a)  proper       high         high<br/>&gt;         (b)  proper       high         low<br/>&gt;         (c)  proper       low          high<br/>&gt;         (d)  proper       low          low<br/>&gt;         (e)  improper     ----         high<br/>&gt;         (f)  improper     ----         low<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And discusses them...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Notice that in Figure 1, all scales in 12tET with which we are most<br/>&gt;         familiar (the major, minor, and Chinese pentatonic) conform to<br/>&gt;         situation (a).  In fact, the major scale (of which the &quot;natural&quot; minor<br/>&gt;         is a mode) is far higher in both stability and efficiency than any<br/>&gt;         other 7-tone scale.  Next among 7-tone scales is the &quot;melodic&quot; minor<br/>&gt;         (2,2,2,2,1,2,1).  The Chinese pentatonic stands out among scales of 5<br/>&gt;         and 6 tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         However, situation (b) applies to many scales with which we are<br/>&gt;         familiar, such as the &quot;whole-tone&quot; and &quot;12-tone&quot; scales.  Note that<br/>&gt;         while these are strictly proper scales, from the hearing of a<br/>&gt;         sufficient set (any element) alone, it is not possible to code the<br/>&gt;         elements of P into scale degrees.  That is, although PxP is coded by<br/>&gt;         the proper mapping, there is no way to index elements of P except by<br/>&gt;         arbitrary choice.  __Thus, since in these cases intervals are coded<br/>&gt;         but tones are not, composition with these scales must involve<br/>&gt;         relations which make use of motivic similarities rather than relations<br/>&gt;         between scale degrees.__  Hence the tone row basis of 12-tone music<br/>&gt;         (which is essentially motivic in concept) is not surprising.  An<br/>&gt;         examination of  Debussy&apos;s whole-tone piano prelude &quot;Violes&quot; show<br/>&gt;         similar motivic dependency.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Now consider improper scales.  PxP is not coded except by the<br/>&gt;         employment of proper subsets or a fixed tonic.  __Hence information is<br/>&gt;         primarily communicated by the scale degrees.__  Thus it is important<br/>&gt;         that P be coded as quickly as possible, which is indicated by a high<br/>&gt;         redundancy (low efficiency) as in case (f).  It would be expected that<br/>&gt;         scales characterized by case (e) would be extremely difficult to use,<br/>&gt;         except when the tonic is fixed by a drone or similar device and, in<br/>&gt;         fact, we have not discovered such scales in any musical culture<br/>&gt;         examined thus far.  In general, the use of motivic sequences on<br/>&gt;         different scale degrees of improper scales would not be expected<br/>&gt;         (except within proper subsets of such scales), and this is strongly<br/>&gt;         supported by examination of Indian and other music using improper<br/>&gt;         scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         We would also expect that proper scales characterized by low stability<br/>&gt;         would tend to be used as improper scales, so that case (c) would<br/>&gt;         resemble case (e), and (d) resemble (f), and similar remarks apply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Makes cross-cultural observations...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         In Java there exist two scale systems, &quot;Slendro&quot; and &quot;Pelog&quot;, each<br/>&gt;         containing a variety of scales.  It has been observed that all scales<br/>&gt;         in the &quot;Slendro&quot; class are strictly proper and that all in the &quot;Pelog&quot;<br/>&gt;         class are improper.  In a study conducted with the assistance of Mr.<br/>&gt;         Surya Brata of the Ministry of Education and Culture, Jakarta, the<br/>&gt;         uses of these scale systems were observed to be in accord with the<br/>&gt;         predictions of this model.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
