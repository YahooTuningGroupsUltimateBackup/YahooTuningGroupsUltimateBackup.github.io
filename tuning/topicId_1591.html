Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/1999 7:40:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and Johnny Reinhard has proposed an interesting thesis for<br/>which I might not be the most unlikely person to offer what I hope be a<br/>friendly and spirited dissent:</p><p>&gt; The ditone (or the 81/64 or 408 cents) interval is not a &quot;third&quot; in any<br/>&gt; functional sense.  It is not a holistic part of a harmony, but rather<br/>&gt; the sum of 2 whole tones (of 9/8 or 204 cents).  And it was never called<br/>&gt; a third during its use in Europe.</p><p>Here we really have two questions: first, was the Pythagorean ditone at<br/>81:64 ever referred to as a &quot;third&quot; (Latin _tertia_) during the era of its<br/>characteristic usage, say 1200-1420? Also, was it sometimes describeed as<br/>a &quot;practical third&quot; later in the history of European music and tunings?</p><p>The answer here is a simple _yes_, since Jacobus of Liege, in his<br/>_Speculum musicae_ (c. 1325), possibly the most encyclopedic exposition<br/>available both of medieval Pythagorean tuning and of 13th-century musical<br/>practice, refers to the two regular varieties of the third as _una tertia<br/>in ditono_ (&quot;a third in the ditone [ratio],&quot; i.e. 81:64) and _una<br/>tertia in semiditono_ (i.e. &quot;a third in the semiditone [ratio],&quot; 32:27). A<br/>fifth may be &quot;split&quot; (_fissa_) into two such _tertiae_ by a third<br/>simultanous voice, producing the mildly unstable and pleasing _quinta<br/>fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; sonority, e.g. c-e-g or d-f-a.</p><p>Of course, &quot;functionality&quot; is a matter of definition, and also a point of<br/>debate. I would say that both 13th-century and 18th-century harmony have<br/>their own &quot;functional&quot; progressions -- maybe &quot;directed progressions&quot; is<br/>just as good and less controversy-provoking (grin).</p><p>Anyway, I say that medieval Pythagorean thirds in the era 1200-1400, and<br/>some time before that, are indeed &quot;thirdlike&quot; in their own way: they are<br/>less concordant in theory and practice than fifths, and more concordant<br/>than M2 and m7, say. Note that one could debate whether a diminished<br/>fourth in 1/4-comma meantone or 5-limit JI (32:25, c. 427 cents), or an<br/>interval such as 6/17 octave (c. 423.5 cents), is a &quot;third&quot; in the same<br/>sense; various listeners might find it _more_ tense than M2 or m7, for<br/>example.</p><p>Of course, as Ed Foote might remind me, the ditone or near-ditone _was_<br/>accepted as a &quot;third&quot; (albeit a tense one) in various well-temperaments of<br/>the late 17th-19th century, and Charles, Earl of Stanhope (hope I got the<br/>first name right), declared around 1800 that the &quot;ditonic&quot; thirds in<br/>remote keys of such tunings had a &quot;pathetic&quot; power which 12-tone equal<br/>temperament lacked, just as it also sacrificed the smoothness of the most<br/>common keys. Thus Stanhope indeed regarded the ditone as a third, and as a<br/>memorable one worth keeping in a keyboard tuning system.</p><p>&gt; Playing the musicology game of &quot;psychological differences regarding thirds<br/>&gt; through history&quot; is to help disguise ignorance.  This is an important<br/>&gt; distinction because there are many different sizes of tempered thirds.<br/>&gt; However, the ditone is not even a tempered interval.</p><p>In a Gothic setting, I&apos;d agree on the last point -- I consider the ditone<br/>as a &quot;true&quot; major third in this context, not a tempered interval. I&apos;d say<br/>&quot;a just 81:64,&quot; but that might prompt both controversy and needless<br/>confusion. One could also follow Prosdocimus and Ugolino in the early 15th<br/>century, and speak of a &quot;fully perfected&quot; major third ideally poised to<br/>expand into a fifth. Incidentally, Ugolino uses _tertia_ (&quot;third&quot;) to<br/>describe both major and minor thirds, also referred to as respectively<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;imperfect.&quot;</p><p>From an 18th-19th century perspective, of course, the ditone _is_ in<br/>effect a highly tempered major third, although generated from pure fifths.</p><p>Again, this is one of my favorite intervals, so people know my biases<br/>&lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
