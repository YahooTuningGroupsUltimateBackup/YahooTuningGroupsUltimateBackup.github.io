Of course, this interesting<br/>statistic quite leaves aside the fact that Pythagorean is 3-limit just<br/>intonation (JI), not an equal temperament of any variety. If I<br/>translate &quot;17.095-tet&quot; to a Gary Morrison style &quot;~70.196-cet,&quot; then<br/>the obvious difference becomes more clear: a Pythagorean diatonic<br/>semitone is around 90 cents, not 70 cents!</p><p>Interestingly, ten steps make a pure 3:2 fifth -- sort of like two<br/>mean-tones make a 5:4 major third.</p><p>To both of you, I would say that I now realize that my interpretation<br/>of &quot;consistency&quot; is obviously something very different than the<br/>concept relating to equal temperaments. All I mean -- and I should use<br/>a differen term -- is that in Pythagorean 24, for example, a narrow<br/>minor third (~7:6) plus a fifth (3:2) makes a narrow minor seventh<br/>(~7:4); and likewise that a wide major third (~9:7) plus a fourth<br/>(4:3) makes a wide major sixth (~12:7), etc. These intervals &quot;add up&quot;<br/>as expected.</p><p>Curiously, when I talk about what I should maybe call something like<br/>&quot;7-limit congruency&quot; (if that term isn&apos;t also already in use), I<br/>typically mean a 9-odd-limit tetrad like 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24,<br/>both with regular resolutions featuring expansion of the 9:7 to a<br/>stable 3:2. Of course, three-note subsets like 12:18:21 or 14:21:24<br/>would remain with the 7-odd-limit. The resolutions, a feature of<br/>Xeno-Gothic (Pythagorean 24) are based on a 3-stability-limit.</p><p>Dan, quite apart from my confusion on 17.095-tet, I was really excited<br/>to see how your idea for this temperament led to all kinds of lattices<br/>and musical concepts -- it looks the kind of thing that could lead to<br/>some very striking music. It&apos;s curious how these dialogues can unleash<br/>creativity in various unexpected directions.</p><p>While I may not understand all of your fine points about this scale,<br/>please let me urge you to make some beautiful music based on it.</p><p>Paul, just as you called to my attention that Partch&apos;s<br/>otonality/utonality was meant to apply only to the 5-limit or higher,<br/>so you&apos;ve helpfully filled me in on my misunderstanding of<br/>&quot;consistency.&quot; I want to use these terms correctly -- or use others<br/>which may better fit my intended concepts.</p><p>Dan, here&apos;s one of those &quot;unusual&quot; neo-Gothic progressions in 17-tet<br/>which might be of interest, an augmented sixth expanding to an octave:</p><p>     C#4 - D4<br/>     G3  - A3<br/>     Eb3 - D3</p><p>Here the lower major third to fifth is standard, but the augmented<br/>sixth is &quot;something different&quot; (~24:13), and the upper augmented<br/>fourth very close to 13:9. At this point, I&apos;m only reporting a<br/>mathematical proximity; I&apos;m not sure about musical implications of<br/>&quot;13-ness,&quot; although as someone used to large Pythagorean integer<br/>ratios, I have a taste for higher primes as well, I guess &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Something like</p><p>C#4  D4<br/>G3   A3<br/>D3</p><p>with the two upper voices resolving by oblique motion over a<br/>stationary lowest voice would be quite like Perotin (e.g. opening of<br/>_Viderunt omnes_, maybe around 1198) -- a transposition of the more<br/>likely</p><p>E4   F4<br/>Bb3  C4<br/>F3</p><p>That augmented sixth in the first example has an effect similar and<br/>quite different -- one of the attractions of 17-tet.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=11029 href="#11029">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2000 12:05:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo and others,</p><p>I haven&apos;t been following this thread too closely, but upon<br/>reading a bit of TD 699.10, I thought that perhaps I&apos;d point<br/>out, if it hasn&apos;t been already, that 53-EDO or -tET is the<br/>smallest EDO that accurately approximates both 3-limit<br/>Pythagorean and 5-limit JI tuning.</p><p>This is because 2^(1/53), the &apos;step-size&apos; of 53-EDO, is<br/>almost exactly midway between the two relevant commas,<br/>being ~1.1 cent smaller than the Pythagorean and ~0.8 cent<br/>larger than the syntonic:</p><p>~21.5    cents - syntonic comma<br/>~22.6415 cents - 2^(1/53)<br/>~23.46   cents - Pythagorean comma</p><p>Therefore, any combinations of tones in 53-EDO will yield<br/>pitches or intervals that are reasonably close to any of the<br/>rational ones within a 5-limit system of 53 tones or less.</p><p>An important point to note is that 53-EDO distinguishes between<br/>the two different sizes of semitone in both the Pythagorean<br/>and 5-limit JI tunings; it would thus be inappropriate<br/>(or at least, radical) for performance of works written with<br/>a 12-note meantone tuning in mind.  An extended meantone is<br/>perhaps another matter...</p><p>If one&apos;s interest is to find EDOs which provide good approximations<br/>to &apos;Xeno-Gothic&apos; Pythagorean tunings, 53-EDO is the prime candidate.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
