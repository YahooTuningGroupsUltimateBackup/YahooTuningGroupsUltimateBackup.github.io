That is to say, if I play an A minor, the<br/>perceived fundamental is usually an F for me.</p><p>I know we don&apos;t have harmonic entropy curves for triads or tetrads,<br/>but if an A minor triad is played with an A in the bass, might it be<br/>possible that the best &quot;fit&quot; for that, in terms of harmonic entropy,<br/>really WOULD be to perceive the minor third as a slightly sharp 19/16?<br/>The minor third dyad alone between A and C might likely be heard as a<br/>6/5, but if an A is added in the bass as well - around the same<br/>register as the fundamental, just like a bass playing the root of a<br/>minor triad - might the harmonic entropy curves actually dictate that<br/>you WOULD hear the whole chord as being a 19/16 minor triad rather<br/>than a 6/5?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
