Paul Erlich&apos;s recent post on &quot;unison vectors&quot;<br/>leads me to propose the concept of a &quot;replication vector&quot; as a rather<br/>technical term for an approach to generating tunings which I find<br/>congenial.</p><p>Also, while the concept of &quot;dimensionality&quot; is often used in reference<br/>to the number of primes (or primes greater than 2) used as the basis<br/>of a just tuning, I would like to present a different type of<br/>dimensionality which might or might not have already been defined many<br/>times before.</p><p>Taking Paul Erlich&apos;s post as a starting point, I will also begin with<br/>Pythagorean tuning, or 3-limit just intonation (3-limit JI). Here is a<br/>typical Pythagorean chromatic scale of Western European theory around<br/>the 14th century, with lots of familiar and very useful intervals,<br/>shown here in rounded cents:</p><p>     114      294               612     792       996<br/>0        204        408   498       702       906       1110   1200</p><p>Now we come to a possible &quot;bug&quot; of this JI system which can actually<br/>be an engaging feature: the fact that 12 fifths do not quite close the<br/>system, but rather exceed seven octaves by an amount called the<br/>Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents).</p><p>This &quot;gap&quot; in the tuning may be viewed rather as an open door for<br/>generating new intervals by what has been called a &quot;spiral of fifths.&quot;</p><p>While &quot;spiral&quot; is an evocative image, another way of expressing the<br/>potential that an interval such as the Pythagorean comma gives for<br/>larger tunings is a two-dimensional table such as this:</p><p>      138        294              636      816       1020<br/>   24       228        432   522       726       930       1134   1224<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>     114        294              612      792       996<br/>  0        204        408   498       702       906       1110   1200<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>     90      270               588      768        972<br/>-24      180        384   474       678        882       1086   1176</p><p>Here we have a &quot;12 x 3&quot; array: 12 notes in each row, and 3 rows (which<br/>might, for example, represent three 12-note keyboards each tuned a<br/>Pythagorean comma apart. For convenience, I have trated this comma as<br/>an even 24 cents.</p><p>In this scheme, I term the comma a &quot;replication vector,&quot; a distance at<br/>which identical 12-note sets may be repeated in order to generate a<br/>larger tuning. The resulting tuning -- here 36 (12 x 3) notes -- I<br/>refer to as a &quot;vector array.&quot;</p><p>Applying this rather abstruse language to musical practice, we might<br/>have a set of three 12-note keyboards tuned in pure 3:2 fifths a<br/>Pythagorean comma apart. Or, more parsimoniously, we might simply have<br/>two such keyboards, agreeing to call either one the &quot;standard&quot;<br/>keyboard as might be convenient in order to obtain intervals either<br/>wider or narrower than the usual ones by our &quot;replication vector,&quot;<br/>here ~23.46 cents. Such an arrangement opens three possibilities:</p><p>(1) Each keyboard can form a musical &quot;universe&quot; in itself including<br/>all of the usual concords, dual-purpose intervals, and discords for<br/>14th-century Western European music. Without actually using any new<br/>vertical intervals generated by simultaneously combining notes on<br/>different keyboards, we might sometimes &quot;shift&quot; from one keyboard or<br/>universe to another, making a &quot;comma jump.&quot;</p><p>(2) Combining notes on different keyboards gives us new intervals,<br/>such as an extra-wide major sixth at around 930 cents or a narrow<br/>minor seventh at around 972 cents. These two intervals, for example,<br/>invite especially efficient cadential resolutions to an octave and a<br/>fifth respectively by stepwise contrary motion. A narrow major third<br/>of 384 cents, in contrast, may be less efficient than the usual<br/>interval of 408 cents at cadences, but an interesting &quot;diversion&quot; or<br/>element of vertical color at noncadential points.</p><p>(3) We may also use the &quot;replication vector&quot; as a direct melodic<br/>interval in a progression such as the following (C4 is middle C, and<br/>higher numbers show higher octaves):</p><p> E4     F#4    G4<br/>(702)  (996) (1200)<br/> Db4    C#4    D4<br/>(384)  (408)  (702)<br/> A3            G3</p><p>Here the first sonority is a &quot;coloristic&quot; sonority of A3-Db4-E4, a<br/>_quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; with a narrow major third below and a<br/>wide minor third (~318 cents) above. Then the middle voice has a comma<br/>inflection (Db4-C#4) moving it to a usual major third of ~408 cents,<br/>more tense and more actively &quot;striving&quot; for expansion to the fifth<br/>G3-D4, at the same time as the upper voice moves from the fifth to the<br/>usual major sixth A3-F#4 with its directed goal of the octave G3-G4.</p><p>While I know of no medieval example calling for direct melodic motion<br/>by a Pythagorean comma, this example is inspired by a progression<br/>opening an early 15th-century keyboard piece. If we wished to bring<br/>out a contrast between a &quot;diversionary&quot; quality for the opening<br/>sonority and a more directed &quot;cadential&quot; quality for the sixth and<br/>third immediately before the fifth and octave, then the direct<br/>inflection has a curious musical logic.</p><p>Please note that I do not necessarily recommend such direct<br/>inflections in performing early 15th-century music -- although using<br/>both A3-C#4 and A3-Db4 in the course of piece might well have been<br/>done on a suitable keyboard with 15 or more notes per octave -- but<br/>suggest the availability of such a nuance in modern compositions or<br/>improvisations in a &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; style.</p><p>In short, I would like to suggest a kind of &quot;two-dimensional&quot;<br/>structure based on an array of keyboards (actual or conceptual)<br/>located at an interesting distance provided by a &quot;replication vector&quot;<br/>such as the 23.46-cent comma of 3-limit JI.</p><p>Such vectors might be of interest either as factors of variation to<br/>generate new vertical intervals, or as possible direct melodic<br/>intervals. Sometimes there can be a factor of serendipity: a<br/>replication vector which might to arise quite incidentally to the main<br/>aesthetic goals of a tuning may turn out to have dramatic vertical and<br/>melodic potentials for musical expressiveness.</p><p>While my example here happens to be Pythagorean tuning, a JI system,<br/>the same principle can apply to other kinds of tunings, including<br/>tunings mixing just intervals (other than the unison and octave) with<br/>tempered ones. Replication vectors in such &quot;mixed and tempered music&quot;<br/>will be a topic of a post I&apos;m now preparing.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
