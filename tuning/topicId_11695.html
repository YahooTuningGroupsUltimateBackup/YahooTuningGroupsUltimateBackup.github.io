I learned that tetrad at age 7 on the ukulele as, &quot;My dog has fleas.&quot;  But, of course, it&apos;s also the (approximate) standard tuning of the lowest four strings on the guitar.  How did ye olde guitar and ukulele players know how to do that without a supercomputer?  Tee hee.</p><p>Paul, I _love_ the graphic you posted for triads (enttriad.jpg).

This seemed to ba a problem in the local<br/>&gt;minima of the tetrad graph; some chords didn&apos;t make it or got bumped down<br/>&gt;simply beacause they didn&apos;t have a voicing open enough. Octave equivalence<br/>&gt;just makes sence.</p><p>I disagree.  For dyads octave equivalence can be handy, maybe even roughly<br/>insightful up to the 9-limit.  For triads and higher-ads, it gets messy<br/>very quickly.  Observe how much &quot;voicing&quot; can contribute to a characteristic<br/>sound, even for 5-limit triadic music (let alone jazz!).  Get into<br/>higher-limit JI, and many chords will run into different harmonic-series<br/>representations as you invert them.  Take the 7-limit utonal tetrad.  In<br/>&quot;1st&quot; (Partchian) inversion, (1/1 7/6 7/5 7/4), it doesn&apos;t really<br/>approximate any harmonic chord that I know of, but the intervals are all<br/>consonant, and we have a characteristic minor sound.  But in 2nd inversion,<br/>the chord clearly (IMO) approximates a 10:12:15:17 tetrad.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
