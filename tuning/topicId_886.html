And, he&apos;s<br/>not content to believe this himself -- He&apos;s got to<br/>make us believe it too.</p><p>And to do that, he&apos;s got to post on the internet, an<br/>activity which is utterly UNproductive when it comes<br/>to making music, but which is very well suited (highly<br/>PROductive) when it comes to designing instruments.<br/>That&apos;s right folks... all the theory, all the math, it<br/>all ends up being about new instruments, and new methods<br/>of playing instruments.  And that&apos;s something that Brian<br/>McLaren just can&apos;t get his head around.</p><p>And he can&apos;t have us getting around it either.  He&apos;s<br/>got to declare a holy war on the whole bit.</p><p>&gt;    PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES:</p><p>If you&apos;re only interested in making music, everything<br/>mclaren listed is UNproductive, with the following<br/>exception:</p><p>&gt;     [10] Discussions about the specific<br/>&gt; quirks of particular tunings backed up<br/>&gt; by specific musical examples.</p><p>That&apos;s about it.  The only thing really involved in<br/>making music is: making music.</p><p>What about activities that might be PROductive for<br/>*making new instruments*?  New instruments that<br/>another person can use to make music, or that you<br/>can use to make music after you&apos;re done making the<br/>instrument?  That involves a division of labor<br/>principle that doesn&apos;t sit well in the stomach of<br/>Brian McLaren.  Here are some of them:</p><p>&gt;     [1] Trying to use math to discover<br/>&gt; something meaningful about /.../ music.</p><p>&gt;     [4] Quibbling about ratio space, or<br/>&gt; anything closely involved with ratio space.</p><p>(Tell it to Kraig Grady, who found a musical<br/>universe in something given to him by a<br/>person who spend his life doing things<br/>closely involved with ratio space.)</p><p>&gt;     [7] Arguments about abstractions like<br/>&gt; alleged properties of the human brain as<br/>&gt; they supposedly relate to microtonal tunings.</p><p>&gt;     [9] Trying to use the psychoacoustics of<br/>&gt; isolated musical intervals to learn something<br/>&gt; musically meaningful about microtonal music.</p><p>&gt;     [10] Arguing about microtonal scales as<br/>&gt; abstractions rather than embodied in specific<br/>&gt; particular musical compositions.</p><p>&gt;     [11] Arguments about the definition of<br/>&gt; words or activities. EXAMPLE: Arguing over<br/>&gt; what &quot;the scientific method&quot; is, or what<br/>&gt; &quot;dissonance&quot; means.</p><p>&gt;     [12] Arguments about what allegedly does or<br/>&gt; allegedly does not constitute some kind of<br/>&gt; specific activity. EXAMPLE: &quot;But 3-limit is/is not<br/>&gt; really JI!!!!&quot; EXAMPLE: &quot;Jazz does/does not fit<br/>&gt; the definition of microtonal music!!!&quot;<br/>&gt; (Technically a variant of 11 above, but<br/>&gt; this kind of meaningless haggling has<br/>&gt; wasted so much time on-line that it also<br/>&gt; deserves its own special concentric circle<br/>&gt; in Dante&apos;s hell.)</p><p>&gt;    [13] Squabbling about the kinds of harmonies<br/>&gt; which are or are not available in various microtonal<br/>&gt; tunings.  This proves useless since melody proves<br/>&gt; vastly more important in music than harmony.</p><p>---<br/>And Now,</p><p>&gt; PRODUCTIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD MICROTONALITY<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [1] Each intonation has its own unique<br/>&gt;        musical uses<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [2] Each timbre/tuning combination allows<br/>&gt;        remarkable musical possibilities<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [3] Each type of electronic or acoustic<br/>&gt;        instruments offers vivid and musically<br/>&gt;        memorable options for the xenharmonic<br/>&gt;        composer<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [4] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about microtonality<br/>&gt;        by composing microtonal music&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [5] Western history involves a fluctuating<br/>&gt;        melee of musical styles from which the<br/>&gt;        contemporary xenahrmonic composer can<br/>&gt;        usefully draw<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [6]  World music offers a smorgasboard of<br/>&gt;         potentially useful musical approaches<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    [7]  Psychouacoustics and congitive psych<br/>&gt;         and other scientific disciplines offer<br/>&gt;         potentially valuable info on general<br/>&gt;         limits of possible musical strategies,<br/>&gt;         but CANNOT by themselves determine<br/>&gt;         musically meaningful elements of<br/>&gt;         of compositional style</p><p>Agree 100%.</p><p>&gt;    [8]   When composing microtonal music,<br/>&gt;          Western preconceptions must often<br/>&gt;          be tossed into the dumpster</p><p>Disagree 100%.</p><p>---<br/>Finally,</p><p>PRODUCTIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD INSTRUMENT DESIGN:</p><p>[1]  There are different types of musical<br/>scales, which lend themselves differently<br/>to various musical techniques.  Learning<br/>about this will help us make instruments<br/>that make it easier to write powerful music<br/>of the whatever type we happen to fancy.</p><p>[2]  The variety of timbre/tuning combinations<br/>is infinite, but they fall into a relatively<br/>small number of types, knowledge of which would<br/>make our search for new musical resources much<br/>easier, faster, and more successful.</p><p>[4] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about instrument design<br/>by yakking [or surfing] on the internet, with<br/>intelligent and friendly people from all over<br/>the world.&quot;</p><p>(Whoops!  Brian McLaren _is_ an intelligent and<br/>friendly person, but _not when he&apos;s on the<br/>internet_.  That&apos;s because the internet is proven<br/>to cause people to devolve into back-stabbing,<br/>slanderous primates, which never happens in the<br/>real world.)</p><p>[5] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about microtonality by<br/>manipulating lists of numbers and equations<br/>instead of composing unintelligible music on<br/>cheap digital copies of worn-out 19th-century<br/>western instruments.&quot;</p><p>[6] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about microtonality by<br/>studying what others in the field, such as Partch<br/>and Helmholtz, have done.&quot;</p><p>---<br/>  -Carl Lumma<br/>instrument builder</p></div>
