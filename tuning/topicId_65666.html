Eb-Bb and C#-G# are now pure and C-G / E-B very<br/>slightly flat. The sequence of fifths is still symmetrical about D-A.<br/>The &apos;wolf&apos; G#-Eb is now 32/21 (729.2c or 27.3c sharp). F-G# and Eb-C#<br/>are 75/64 (7.7c sharp of 7/6) whereas Bb-C# is pure 7/6.</p><p>C 1<br/>E 5/4<br/>F# 7/5<br/>D 28/25<br/>Bb 224/125<br/>Eb 448/375<br/>G# 196/125<br/>C# 392/375<br/>A 3136/1875<br/>F 12544/9375<br/>B 87808/46875<br/>G 351232/234375</p><p>(This would look a lot simpler if one took Eb to equal 1...)</p><p>The syntonic comma is now divided as 702464/703125 * 3125/3136 *<br/>224/225 * 3125/3136 in the fifths C-G-D-A-E resp.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
