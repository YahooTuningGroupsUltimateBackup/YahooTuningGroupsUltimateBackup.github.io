But if the factors are<br/>not consecutive odds beginning with 1, then you&apos;re not really doing<br/>either according to the definitions in the Tuning Dictionary. But by<br/>analogy, I&apos;d still rather say you&apos;re completing the chords with<br/>respect to the initial factor set, rather than saturating the chords<br/>with respect to the initial factor set.</p></div>
