I remember that Keenan said that until now we don&acute;t know any application of the progression. I reengineered it and this job let me have the exact values of the 12 equal tempered tones thanks to pay attention to twelve cells which are distanced by 51 cells in all the 12 tones. The original procedure to establish the 12 ET scale centuries ago depended on only one arithmetic operation, far from any musical element; the progression method is based on three commas; the new M, J, U sequence. The global examining did the rest.</p><p>Now I am sure that this finding you will receive in less than 10 days. In the mean time in a few minutes I will send to Mike one or two pages of the new progression; I give him my permission to share this provisional and incomplete information with the above mentioned members.</p><p>By</p><p>Mario</p><p>06 July</p></div>
