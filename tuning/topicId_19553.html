I didn&apos;t understand that you were going to include a written<br/>explanation under it!  That would, of course, be fine.  The problem<br/>with me (well, one of the problems) is that when I look at the chain,<br/>initially, I keep wanting to see the E - B as a continuing link<br/>upward... which would, of course, give a Pythagorean third that would<br/>be quite large...  This is just the way the diagram struck me when I<br/>first saw it... I had no idea what you were talking about until<br/>Daniel Wolf explained it to me.  (And he did it quite easily in one<br/>short paragraph).  Therefore, I really *DO* think some text is<br/>necessary for the beginner... (or &quot;advanced&quot; beginner)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is no line indicating a pure interval (perf. fifth) between E<br/>- B<br/>&gt;</p><p>I know... but without the &quot;explanation&quot; I want to &quot;make&quot; one!</p><p>&gt; The fifth E - B in this example is a syntonic comma below the pure<br/>&gt; fifth, because that E is higher than the pure major third to C -<br/>&gt; therefore another E , pure to C, might have been inserted on a<br/>keyboard of a pythagorean tuned organ.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   E&apos;<br/>&gt;  /<br/>&gt; C - G - D - A - E<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, of course, this is quite clear...</p><p>&gt; The E in this example is generated by four pure fifths - it is much<br/>&gt; higher than pure.<br/>&gt; The E&apos; is a pure major third to C.<br/>&gt; The difference between those two E-s is called the syntonic comma,<br/>&gt; defined by 4 pure fifths minus 1 pure major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my example 1 there is only the first E, therefore a E&apos; might have<br/>&gt; been inserted as extra key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In example 2 there is the E&apos; already there, and another E might have<br/>&gt; been added to make the pure chord e-g#-b available<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another<br/>&gt;                                   E&apos;<br/>&gt;                                  /<br/>&gt; Fb- Cb- Gb- Db- Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C - G - D - A - E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Fb at the left is only 1,9 cents below the E&apos;, which serves as<br/>pure major third to C.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Actually, in Daniel Wolf&apos;s post he mentioned the Fb and, with that, I<br/>IMMEDIATELY &quot;got&quot; the idea of the schisma...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Schisma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The schisma is the difference between the<br/>&gt; pythagorean comma (12 pure perfect fifths - 7 octaves) and the<br/>&gt; syntonic comma (4 pure perfect fifths - 1 pure major third - 2<br/>octaves)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The schisma is then<br/>&gt;   (12 pure perfect fifths - 7 octaves)<br/>&gt; - ( 4 pure perfect fifths - 2 octaves - 1 pure major third)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now forget the octaves, because they are just here to keep us in an<br/>&gt; &quot;audible range&quot; and we can use the fourths as complementary<br/>intervals of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Resolving the brackets and without the octaves it is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    12 pure perfect fifths<br/>&gt; -   4 pure perfect fifths<br/>&gt;                           + 1 pure major third<br/>&gt;    --------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; =   8 pure perfect fifths + 1 pure major third<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8 pure perfect fifths + 1 pure major third<br/>&gt; is represented by the chain<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                   E&apos;<br/>&gt;                                  /<br/>&gt; Fb- Cb- Gb- Db- Ab- Eb- Bb- F - C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The difference between the Fb and the E&apos; is the schisma (the E&apos;<br/>being this small amount of 1,955 cents higher than Fb).<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is quite a fine explanation of this and should DEFINITELY be<br/>included in the FAQ.  It might be in the &quot;more info&quot; pages, though,<br/>and presented AFTER the &quot;more basic&quot; concepts like Meantone which, I<br/>believe, is inferred by what Daniel Wolf posted...

It provides a vital perspective which theory alone, or even<br/>experience with modern equivalents of these schemes, cannot provide.</p><p>One small possible change, if you feel it fits, might be to speak of<br/>&quot;Instruments with fewer with 17 notes&quot; rather than &quot;fewer than 19<br/>notes,&quot; if the possible split-key instruments of the later Pythagorean<br/>era (1370-1450 or a bit later) are considered an important part of the<br/>draft.</p><p>The reason is that while 19 notes (a tuning of Gb-B#) provides a<br/>&quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; (MOS) for meantone tunings, with the gamut<br/>divided into only two types of adjacent intervals, minor or chromatic<br/>semitones and dieses (e.g. C-C#-Db-D or E-E#-F-F#), 17 notes (Gb-A#)<br/>likewise provide such an MOS in a Pythagorean tuning, with adjacent<br/>limmas (minor or diatonic semitones) and commas (e.g. C-C#-Db-D or<br/>E-F-Gb-F#).</p><p>Thus early 15th-century theorists regard a &quot;complete&quot; tuning as having<br/>17 notes, just as 19 notes is common in 16th-century theory and<br/>instrument-building practice.</p><p>If, as I read your FAQ draft to say, meantone instruments of 17 or 18<br/>notes are rare, then maybe &quot;fewer than 17 notes&quot; would fit both the<br/>late Pythagorean and meantone eras.</p><p>Currently I am planning two related FAQ drafts which I hope can<br/>complement your material:</p><p>(1) Pythagorean tunings and keyboard schemes, 13-17 notes (1370-1482);<br/>(2) Keyboard instruments with 19 or more notes (1550-1618).</p><p>Here it seems the most common schemes -- with only theoretical schemes<br/>or designs for the Pythagorean era, rather than actual known<br/>instruments, according to my limited and not-so-current sources --<br/>seem to involve regular Pythagorean tunings (within the range of<br/>Gb-A#) or meantone tunings.</p><p>However, both Lindley and your FAQ draft mention the possibility of<br/>theoretical schemes or designs, at least, using Pythagorean notes such<br/>as Cb or Fb, and this could be viewed as a kind of transition from<br/>Pythagorean to some form of meantone or syntonic diatonic JI<br/>tuning. The famous 2/3/5-ratio JI monochord of Ramos (1482), for<br/>example, could be viewed as a modified form of a Pythagorean scheme<br/>with the Wolf at G-D.</p><p>Lindley takes the very tenable position that schemes of this kind were<br/>theoretical rather than practical designs for keyboards, and certainly<br/>having a Wolf fifth between _musica recta_ notes (diatonic notes and<br/>Bb) would create some of the same complications for a player as later<br/>16th-century keyboards of the kind described by Zarlino and Bottrigari<br/>in the syntonic diatonic.</p><p>However, since Zarlino, for example, describes such a syntonic<br/>diatonic keyboard with 16 notes (although noting that it is difficult<br/>to play, and concluding that temperament is much more practical), why<br/>might not some of the transitional Pythagorean schemes also have<br/>built?</p><p>One note: while a Pythagorean scheme with a Wolf between diatonic<br/>notes, or at Bb-F, would be complicated to play, something like the<br/>following seems to me quite practical, if one leans toward having as<br/>many schisma thirds as possible (not too unlikely a preference just at<br/>the point where meantone was coming into vogue around 1450-1480).</p><p>Here I would emphasize that these are my own schemes, and that I am<br/>not aware of these specific schemes in the 15th century, which is not<br/>to say that they might not have been described or used at that time.</p><p>The following three schemes are based on the usual early 15th-century<br/>tuning Gb-B (Wolf at B-Gb, written B-F#), where thirds spelled with<br/>written sharps are played as diminished fourths or augmented seconds<br/>(schisma thirds), with other thirds at their usual Pythagorean sizes.<br/>I use the symbol &quot;@&quot; to show a second version of a _musica recta_ note<br/>lowered by a Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents). In my<br/>tuning chain diagrams, I use notes in parentheses to show the written<br/>notes for which certain accidentals might be played:</p><p>                13 notes: Cb-B (usual Gb-B plus Cb)</p><p>                (B@-F#-C#-G#)<br/>                 Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B</p><p>                   Db     Eb       Gb   Ab   Bb  Cb<br/>                 C      D     E  F    G    A    B  C</p><p>          (This scheme adds a schisma third G-Cb or G-B@)</p><p>                       *      *      *      *</p><p>             14 notes: Fb-B (usual Gb-B plus Fb and Cb)</p><p>             (E@-B@-F#-C#-G#)<br/>              Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B</p><p>                   Db     Eb   Fb  Gb   Ab   Bb  Cb<br/>                 C      D     E  F    G    A    B  C</p><p>         (This scheme adds another schisma third C-Fb or C-E@)</p><p>                       *      *      *      *</p><p>              15 notes: Fb-F# (usual Gb-B plus Fb-Cb, F#)</p><p>             (E@-B@-F#-C#-G#)<br/>              Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#</p><p>                                   F#<br/>                   Db     Eb   Fb  Gb   Ab   Bb  Cb<br/>                 C      D     E  F    G    A    B  C</p><p>      (This scheme adds a pure fifth B-F#, like a 13-note Gb-F#)</p><p>Note that this last scheme is like the usual 15th-century scheme in 13<br/>notes with a split key or the like at Gb/F# to provide a pure fifth at<br/>B-F#, the scheme likely proposed by Ramos&apos;s friend Tristan de Silva.</p><p>If one has tastes of a kind which may have been common around 1450,<br/>and wants to design a keyboard based on Pythagorean tuning with<br/>schisma thirds available for all diatonic notes, or with a free choice<br/>of either regular Pythagorean or schisma thirds for all these notes,<br/>then a kind of counterpart to the 19-note meantone keyboards of the<br/>16th-17th centuries is also possible. This scheme is based on the<br/>17-note organ (Gb-A#) proposed by Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1435?), plus<br/>the two added keys Fb and Cb:</p><p>              19 notes: Fb-A# (usual Gb-A# plus Fb and Cb)</p><p>          (E@-B@-F#-C#-G#)<br/>           Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#</p><p>                   C#     D#       F#   G#   A#<br/>                   Db     Eb   Fb  Gb   Ab   Bb  Cb<br/>                 C      D     E  F    G    A    B  C</p><p>            (This scheme adds schisma thirds C-Fb, G-Cb)</p><p>Note that all of these schemes have the advantage of not disrupting<br/>the usual _musica recta_ chain of fifths (Bb-E), so that the player<br/>does not have to deal with Wolf fifths between any of these regular<br/>notes of the gamut.</p><p>The last scheme is basically the same keyboard layout, but differs in<br/>its tuning, from the 19-note organ described by Ugolino of Orvieto<br/>where the two semitones E-F and B-C are divided by the extra two notes<br/>into equal dieses, as in the ancient enharmonic genus of the Greeks.<br/>Since this interval would be equal to around 45.11 cents (half of<br/>256:243, ~90.22 cents), we might indicate it using something like<br/>Vicentino&apos;s later dot to show a note raised by a diesis, or an ASCII<br/>asterisk (*): thus we have Gb-A# plus E* and B*.</p><p>Ugolino considers the two extra notes optionally added to his usual<br/>17-note Pythagorean gamut (Gb-A#) as rather an antiquarian nicety,<br/>since he says that they do not occur in modern music. However, they<br/>may be of interest as a 15th-century mention of the enharmonic genus,<br/>which of course became the humanist basis of Vicentino&apos;s 31-note<br/>meantone cycle on his archicembalo and arciorgano.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
