If you<br/>think this list is &quot;because I haven&apos;t listened&quot;, on the contrary, it<br/>is gathered from the fact that I have.<br/>************************************************************<br/>  Here are some things I have gathered from this list that appear<br/>crucial to making good scales:</p><p>1. Periodicity IE beating is OK so long as it happens at relatively<br/>the same rate between multiple different frequencies (as it does in<br/>the harmonic series).</p><p>2. Critical Band: consonance so far as not having two notes (or their<br/>overtone) too close together is an issue, even the harmonic series<br/>around the 20th+ overtone begins to beat too much (even though it beat<br/>periodically) to be tolerable.<br/>------------------------------------<br/>   I think it is fair to say BOTH critical band and periodicity need<br/>to be watched...ideally both and not just one or the other need to<br/>work.  You can, apparently, make a scale where notes and overtone are<br/>so far apart that periodicity is not an issue, but then it seems you<br/>are talking about things like 4-note chords and not &quot;full&quot; scales.<br/>**********************************************************</p><p>3. Just because a scale sounds consonant when you compare any two<br/>notes (dyad)...means a decent % of, but not all the chords formed by<br/>it will be consonant...this is why Sethares&apos; theory is useful but not<br/>by any means perfect.</p><p>4. Tunings often sound dissonant (IE all notes in 12TET played &quot;at<br/>once&quot; sound dissonant) while subsets of them (IE 7-note scales built<br/>to approximate JI) sound consonant.  IE it is VERY important to<br/>understand the difference between a tuning and a scale.  A tuning,<br/>played in free-form, can sound like crap while a scale under it can<br/>sound absolutely fantastic (and ideally, be transpose-able under a<br/>tuning).</p><p>5. Not everything HAS to be JI (or something like mean-tone or 12TET,<br/>which approximates JI) to sound good.<br/>   Lucy-tuning, Sethares&apos;s timbre/scale matching for things like<br/>10TET, MOS scales, tetrad-based scales like 9/8 * 10/9 * 11/12 * 10/9<br/>* 11/10 * 12/11...also sound good.    One thing that seems to show<br/>particular promise is spliting the ratios 1 to 1.5 into one JI scale<br/>and 1.5-2 into another JI scale (like the scale I demonstrated above).<br/> IMVHO, taking well-chosen 7-note subsets of the &quot;golden ratio tuning&quot;<br/>can also provide consonant scale.</p><p>6. 12TET has some issues.  Like 3rds and 6ths off by 10+ cents and<br/>many complex chords that can not be inverted without causing a lot of<br/>dissonance.  JI makes some intervals more pure at the expense of<br/>others...only adaptive JI keeps &quot;everything&quot; pure all the time.<br/>  Even, for example, simply looking through Carl&apos;s 12-tone tuning<br/>section...there are a lot of things around that sound better than<br/>12TET as tunings and I encourage people to make more instead of<br/>&quot;settling&quot; for 12TET.</p><p>    In my mind...an ideal tuning would have virtually all intervals be<br/>&quot;fairly close to consonant&quot;, rather than some almost perfectly close<br/>and others horrendously off (again, thinking of things like the 3rd in<br/>12TET).</p><p>7.  Repeating proportions seem important; be it the circle of 5ths,<br/>the JI series itself, Equal temperament, repeating difference between<br/>notes in periodicity, rational numbers, repeating interval gaps in<br/>MOS...just something the brain can summarize into a single &quot;function&quot;<br/>easily.<br/>************************************************</p><p>  So, In general I think it&apos;s fair to say there is ONE GOLDEN RULE<br/>that dominates what makes a scale under a tuning sound good...and,<br/>rather, it is a combination of factors, such as periodicity, critical<br/>band compliance, and repeating proportions (not just between root<br/>notes but also overtones).</p><p>  The best scales, IMVHO, are not ones that nail ones single factor<br/>perfectly, but achieve a balance between them all.</p></div><h3>djtrancendance &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2009 9:44:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--So, In general I think it&apos;s fair to say there is ONE GOLDEN RULE<br/>Typo, I meant to say there is NO one golden rule</p></div><h3>Ben Miller &#x3C;bencole.miller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2009 2:00:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>maybe the golden rule is if it sounds good.</p><p>On Wed, Feb 4, 2009 at 12:44 PM, djtrancendance &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;   --So, In general I think it&apos;s fair to say there is ONE GOLDEN RULE<br/>&gt; Typo, I meant to say there is NO one golden rule<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
