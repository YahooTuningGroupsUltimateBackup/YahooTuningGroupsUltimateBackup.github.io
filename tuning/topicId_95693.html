Well, here is the realization of that idea. Using pianoteq 3.6 and Sonar X1 I recorded an improvisation with arpeggiator at eight notes and 2 octaves and a BPM of 60. I used a 15 note tuning with harmonics 12 to 30 reduced to an octave  and then repeated for every octave. The arpeggiated notes are purposefully quieter in order to provide a &quot;cloud&quot; of notes in support of the main themes.</p><p>!
