Where would you used +29?</p><p>&gt;Efficiency is best with &gt; 50 because actual<br/>&gt;practice often retains &quot;just&quot; or tonal identification.</p><p>&gt;Monzo, the quartertone accidentals are in no way identical with a constant<br/>&gt;quartertone system. Paul Erlich actually posted about the &gt; 25 possibility<br/>a<br/>&gt;couple of years ago, and I did consider it.  However, my music is tonally<br/>&gt;based, and I need the flexibility.</p><p>Johnny, in a similar vein (I think), I plan to (in the next day or two)<br/>notate the 22-tET piece in 12-tET with +/- 50 cent notations but no<br/>quartertone accidentals. The harmonies are 9-limit with 15, and 12-tET is<br/>consistent within that limit . . . and the progression as a whole doesn&apos;t<br/>drift when performed in 12-tET . . . however, most of the steps are 1/22<br/>oct. (54.5 cents).</p></div>
