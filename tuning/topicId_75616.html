Like the 2nd set it creates a triad<br/>of 2 minor 3rds.</p><p>By keeping the same angle but changing the timing, 2 different 3rds<br/>are created.  Conversely, by keeping the timing but changing the<br/>angle, the same 3rds can be created.</p><p>This particular example is just basic geometry but taking the idea to<br/>the n-th degree can lead to interesting relationships between timing<br/>and harmony.</p><p>So my question is this...<br/>Has somebody already done (or is currently doing) anything with this<br/>type of bent harmonies and has a theory fleshed out, and if so, what<br/>is it called and where can I find out more about it?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Andy F.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2008 3:06:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andrew Fillebrown&quot; &lt;AMiltonF@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know a better place to ask this so here goes...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the picture linked below...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i234/Monkage/BentChordTheory.jpg">http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i234/Monkage/BentChordTheory.jpg</a><br/>//<br/>&gt; So my question is this...<br/>&gt; Has somebody already done (or is currently doing) anything with<br/>&gt; this type of bent harmonies and has a theory fleshed out, and<br/>&gt; if so, what is it called and where can I find out more about it?</p><p>Hi Andy,</p><p>Cool question.
