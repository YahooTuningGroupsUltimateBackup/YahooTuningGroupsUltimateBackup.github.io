They are<br/>also a simple profit-loss, and do not need outside<br/>assistance in many cases.</p><p>You are also free to report the income as a hobby.  The deductions<br/>will, in that case, be limited to schedule A, but this will<br/>certainly make the exercise easier.  In my experience, most musicians<br/>have other &apos;Schedule C&apos; items, so the CD per se simply drops<br/>into the existing form for that year.</p><p>The bigger problem, honestly, is on the state level!  Suddenly<br/>one has stock-in-trade, inventory, COGS, excise taxes, and,<br/>shudder - the ultra-big vampire of Sales Taxes.</p><p>Many of these aren&apos;t an issue for you there in Texas, but<br/>the Sales Tax thing is and it argues for some informed advice.</p><p>As for returning the money for bought CD&apos;s - its a novel idea but<br/>remember that most individual taxpayers are cash basis - income<br/>is recognized in the year received.</p><p>Rick Sanford<br/>Manhattan</p></div>
