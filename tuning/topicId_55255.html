I thought there would<br/>be a name for a vector space with a ring as the scalars<br/>instead of a field, and that&apos;s what it is:</p><p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Module.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Module.html</a></p><p>So, we have a module embedded in an implied<br/>vector space with the reals as the<br/>natural choice for the scalar field<br/>for the embedding.</p><p>Then, if you want to make a one one map<br/>from intervals to the vector space then<br/>- each interval maps to a unique<br/>subset of the vector space so use<br/>that instead. E.g. each interval<br/>corresponds to a line in the vector<br/>space implied by the 2D Tenney lattice,<br/>or a plane in the 3D lattice and so on<br/>- just reduces the dimension by 1.</p><p>That&apos;s just a matter of taking a geometric<br/>approcah ratehr than an algebraic approach<br/>to the Tenney lattice - and it may be<br/>useful to do that in some situations.<br/>Maybe examining geometric constructions<br/>may lead to interesting ways of proving<br/>results - it is probably the sort of<br/>approach I would follow if I did some<br/>work on this as I&apos;ve done work before<br/>on multi-dimensional geometry and<br/>it is a natural thing to follow up.</p><p>For instance, the non periodic Penrose tiling<br/>based pitch Lattice that Erv Wilson defined<br/>would be a natural thing to explore<br/>in a geometric context, though it would also indeed<br/>have a natural algebraic interpretation too using<br/>the interpretation of a Penrose tiling as<br/>the 2D projection of a slice at a particular<br/>angle through a tiling by hypercubes in five<br/>dimensional space - and then interpreting<br/>the 5D space algebraically.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=55258 href="#55258">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2004 9:03:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Robert,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s just a matter of taking a geometric<br/>&gt; approcah ratehr than an algebraic approach<br/>&gt; to the Tenney lattice - and it may be<br/>&gt; useful to do that in some situations.</p><p>it&apos;s *definitely* useful to use geometry<br/>sometimes instead of (or as a complement to)<br/>algebra !!!!!!!</p><p>there are some of us (me, for instance) who<br/>really have a hard time with algebra above<br/>the elementary level, but who have no problem<br/>grasping the structure and properties when viewing<br/>it geometrically.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=55259 href="#55259">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2004 9:32:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Monz,</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s just a matter of taking a geometric<br/>&gt; &gt; approcah ratehr than an algebraic approach<br/>&gt; &gt; to the Tenney lattice - and it may be<br/>&gt; &gt; useful to do that in some situations.</p><p>&gt; it&apos;s *definitely* useful to use geometry<br/>&gt; sometimes instead of (or as a complement to)<br/>&gt; algebra !!!!!!!</p><p>&gt; there are some of us (me, for instance) who<br/>&gt; really have a hard time with algebra above<br/>&gt; the elementary level, but who have no problem<br/>&gt; grasping the structure and properties when viewing<br/>&gt; it geometrically.</p><p>Oh I think that was an example of typical<br/>British understatement :-).</p><p>I should say it is often very useful<br/>to take a geometric approach.
