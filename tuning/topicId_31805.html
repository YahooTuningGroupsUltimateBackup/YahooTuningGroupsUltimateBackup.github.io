Clearly, there is some very special difference between<br/>&gt; &gt; 3-limit and 5-limit ratios, more than simply the size of the numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or look at meter. 3 and 2, and their &quot;octave equivalents, 4, 6, 8 (and<br/>&gt; to a lesser extent 9 and 12) dominate musics which have a metric<br/>&gt; orientation. The more comlicated prime rhythm musics (Balkan and Indian<br/>&gt; musics) tend to heirarchically arrive at those primes by summing 2&apos;s, 3&apos;s<br/>&gt; and 4&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Its not just that small numbers are &quot;good&quot;, but very small numbers are<br/>&gt; &quot;good&quot;.

What about pitch multiplications/divisions of the other prime numbers 3, 5, and 7?

Additionally, are &quot;octave-invariance&quot; phenomena relevant to *melody*, or just to *harmony*? Do &quot;limits of recognizability&quot; exist in the degree of octave stretching/shrinking (the number of octaves shifted) when concepts of &quot;octave-invariance&quot; are applied in &quot;harmony&quot;?

Coincidences among higher partials (when they exist due to prescence of energy at the partials spoken of here) happen at an initial frequency, and (potentially) at all frequencies that are integer multiples of the initial frequency.

Pitch commonality is less pronounced for tones in<br/>fifth and fourth intervals. And it is more or less negligible for any<br/>of the other intervals. This elucidates and explains the particular<br/>role played by the octave and the fifth, at least where sensory<br/>affinity is concerned.&quot;</p><p>Bob reponds to this quote and Paul&apos;s comment below:<br/>Yes, I agree that pitch commonality of the harmonics is crucial to<br/>the understanding of pitch affinity. I would think, however, that the<br/>statistical predominance of acoustic energy in the lower harmonics is<br/>a contributor that is not at all neligible in its importance and in<br/>noticing the presence of these intervals withing a single tone.</p><p>Any good ear will notice the octave overtone of many kinds of flute<br/>timbres and the fifth is also quite prominent in some. Moreover, the<br/>flute overtones vary substantially with fluctuations in embouchure,<br/>which would tend to make them more noticeable even within a single<br/>tone. Flutes are, after all, among the most culturally universal<br/>instrumental phenomena.</p><p>I don&apos;t quite understand why he says &quot;more or less negligible for any<br/>of the other intervals&quot;, though, unless he refers only to the NUMBER<br/>of common pitches RELATIVE  to those in the octaves, fifths, and<br/>fourths, which case he is undoubtedly right on the mark.

To the best of my rusty memory, I&apos;m fairly<br/>&gt; confident<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (but not absolutely so) that ACOUSTIC power is directly<br/>&gt; proportional<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to both amplitude and frequency. I believe the relationship of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; amplitude and power is not the same acoustically as electrically<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because of the way they are defined.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The bottom line for our discussion of the relative acoustic power<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lower vs. higher harmonics is that despite this, more acoustic<br/>&gt; energy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is generally concentrated individually in one or more of the<br/>&gt; first<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; few lower harmonics than in any individual harmonics higher than<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; first four. There are notable exceptions to this, as Paul Erlich<br/>&gt; has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out, citing the human voice on certain vowels as an<br/>&gt; example.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I pointed out in a response that this is truer in trained voices<br/>&gt; than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in traditional folk singing, the latter of which is more germaine<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this discussion of the universality of octaves, fifths, and<br/>&gt; fourths.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think, also, that statistically the phenomenon is sufficiently<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; significant, especially in the case of the culturally ubiquitous<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; flute, to add quite a bit of weight to the high rate of common<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmonics that occur between fundamentals representing the same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships (octaves, fourths, and fifths) to each other. Taken<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; together, I believe these physical realities eliminate the<br/>&gt; mystery<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; concerning why these intervals would prevail in the melodic<br/>&gt; systems<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of most cultures in any era.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob and Joe,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve done some digging into Olson&apos;s &quot;Music, Physics,<br/>&gt; &gt; and Engineering&quot;, 2nd Edition, Dover, 1967, and here<br/>&gt; &gt; is what I find:</p><p>[[[ The units of *sound pressure* are those of &quot;force&quot; per<br/>[[[ unit area.

Pehrson</p><p>J Gill: Joe, I had a couple errors in my previous text,<br/>which Gene was kind to point out. I have edited my post<br/>in the copy above (you will find &apos;[[[&apos; to the left of the<br/>modified text). Hopefully, that will help a bit. What I<br/>mean to say in the above post, and it&apos;s implications, are:</p><p>(1) &quot;Acoustic power&quot; (which is in units of &quot;ergs&quot; of *energy*<br/>transferred per square centimeter per second ) is *not* the same<br/>thing as &quot;loudness&quot; (which is a measure of *sound pressure*,<br/>and is in units of &quot;dynes&quot; of *force* per square centimeter).</p><p>(2) For a &quot;flat&quot; spectrum (equal in value at all frequencies)<br/>of &quot;sound pressure level&quot; (which is closest to what we actually<br/>&quot;hear&quot;), the &quot;acoustic power&quot; of (either a plane or a spherical)<br/>sound wave will *decrease* in a manner proportional to the value<br/>of frequency considered (at -6 dB / octave). Therefore, the<br/>measured &quot;acoustic power&quot; is the *integral* of the measured<br/>&quot;sound pressure level&quot;, and is, then, fundamentally different.</p><p>(3) The &quot;sound pressure level&quot; spectrum which a microphone<br/>picks up and we might display on a spectrum analyzer produced<br/>by musical resonators with harmonically related overtones<br/>[such as the averaged human voice, or a 75-piece orchestra<br/>where, indeed, some of the sources have non-harmonic energy,<br/>themselves], *decreases* with increasing harmonic number above<br/>the lowest fundamental frequency of that/those source(s).<br/>Male speech &quot;rolls-off&quot; at around -3db/octave between<br/>100 Hz and 1000 Hz, and at around -6dB/octave between<br/>1000 Hz and 10,000 Hz. Female speech is similar, but<br/>with the first formant frequency being somewhat higher.<br/>A 75-piece orchestra &quot;rolls-off&quot; in a manner rather<br/>similar to that of &quot;male speech&quot; above, as well.<br/>By &quot;roll-off&quot;, I mean, &quot;decreasing amplitude of sound pressure<br/>level&quot; as frequency (and as harmonic number) increases.</p><p>(5) &quot;Loudness&quot; itself (the actual units of the perceived<br/>&quot;intensity&quot; of a tone) is, additionally, related in a<br/>non-linear manner to *sound pressure*. At values of less<br/>than 40 Phons of sound pressure (2 x 10^4 dynes/cm^2 at<br/>at 1000 Hz), our &quot;ears&quot; act like a &quot;downward expander&quot;,<br/>and at values greater than 40 Phons of sound pressure,<br/>our &quot;ears&quot; act like a &quot;compressor&quot;. This effect varies<br/>with frequency both above as well as below 1000 Hz.</p><p>Sorry about the previous typos!

These criteria apply practically only to two musical intervals, namely, the octave, and, to a lesser degree, the fifth. &gt;&gt;</p><p>While beats seem a separate issue, allright, the &quot;affinity&quot;<br/>concept of Terhardt&apos;s *does* relate to the two intervals<br/>invariably (also) described as the most *consonant* by<br/>(it seems) &quot;dissonance curves&quot;, and other propositions as<br/>to the (generalized) &quot;compatability&quot; of simultaneous tones.</p><p>It seems that a &quot;similarity relationship&quot; between two or<br/>more tones does not preclude those tones from also being<br/>described (in various general terms) as &quot;compatible&quot;.</p><p>Without knowing the &quot;end of such a journey&quot; [being the<br/>successful &quot;atomization&quot; of the *total* effect into (this<br/>or that) conceptually described &quot;phenomenon&quot;], what real<br/>psychoacoustic assurances can we present ourselves with<br/>which would establish that an &quot;affinity/similarity&quot;<br/>relationship between two or more tones (sinusoidal, or<br/>complex with harmonics) *is* a phenomenon separable from<br/>other (humanly perceived) characteristics of such tonal<br/>combinations which result in (humanly judged) descriptors<br/>of tonal &quot;consonance&quot;, &quot;compatability&quot;, or &quot;coincidence&quot;?</p><p>Of &quot;sensory affinity&quot;, Terhardt states:</p><p>&lt;&lt;  sensory affinity, emerges from the fact that the pitch of any complex tone is multiple (see topic definition of pitch). As a consequence of the multiplicity of pitch, and of the particular intervals that exist between the simultaneous pitches of any single harmonic complex tone, there occurs commonality of pitches when the oscillation frequencies of two successive harmonic complex tones are in a 1:2 or 2:3 ratio. Commonality means that one of the tones has some pitches in common with the other, and this immediately accounts for an enhanced similarity of the tones as compared to other frequency ratios, i.e., for sensory affinity. &gt;&gt;</p><p>The above sure appears (to me) to describe a (single) phenomenon<br/>related to &quot;concidence&quot; of partials of complex (harmonic) tones.</p><p>Of an &quot;auditory sense&quot;, Terhardt states:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Octave- and fifth-matching can be done with practically any type of tone, in particular, both with harmonic complex tones and with sine tones.

I believe the relationship<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amplitude and power is not the same acoustically as<br/>electrically<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because of the way they are defined.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottom line for our discussion of the relative acoustic<br/>power<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lower vs. higher harmonics is that despite this, more<br/>acoustic<br/>&gt; &gt; energy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is generally concentrated individually in one or more of the<br/>&gt; &gt; first<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few lower harmonics than in any individual harmonics higher<br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first four. There are notable exceptions to this, as Paul<br/>Erlich<br/>&gt; &gt; has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out, citing the human voice on certain vowels as an<br/>&gt; &gt; example.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I pointed out in a response that this is truer in trained<br/>voices<br/>&gt; &gt; than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in traditional folk singing, the latter of which is more<br/>germaine<br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this discussion of the universality of octaves, fifths, and<br/>&gt; &gt; fourths.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think, also, that statistically the phenomenon is<br/>sufficiently<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant, especially in the case of the culturally<br/>ubiquitous<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flute, to add quite a bit of weight to the high rate of<br/>common<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harmonics that occur between fundamentals representing the<br/>same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationships (octaves, fourths, and fifths) to each other.<br/>Taken<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together, I believe these physical realities eliminate the<br/>&gt; &gt; mystery<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerning why these intervals would prevail in the melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; systems<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of most cultures in any era.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bob and Joe,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve done some digging into Olson&apos;s &quot;Music, Physics,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and Engineering&quot;, 2nd Edition, Dover, 1967, and here<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is what I find:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [[[ The units of *sound pressure* are those of &quot;force&quot; per<br/>&gt; [[[ unit area.

Although<br/>the relationships of loudness to distance is not germaine to our<br/>original discussion and could serve to confuse some into thinking it<br/>is, the sound pressure level being closer to subjective loudness than<br/>acoustic power is an important distinction about which I was not<br/>clear. Thanks again!</p><p>My original thoughts were based on the idea that there is a<br/>statistically high probability that one or more of the first four<br/>harmonics will be typically more prominent to the ear than any<br/>individual harmonics higher than that in harmonic timbres from most<br/>common sources, most notably the culturally almost universal flute in<br/>one variation or other. I used the term acoustic energy to express<br/>this, which turns out to have been a bit off.</p><p>However, it seems to me that Jeremy&apos;s clarifications have only<br/>reinforced rather than weakened this conjecture. I have read<br/>Terhardt&apos;s information on the rate of coincident harmonics as we go<br/>to higher harmonics, and I agree that this explains the phenomenon<br/>under discussion, namely the almost universal existence of fifths,<br/>fourths, and octaves as melodic intervals both cross-temporally and<br/>cross-culturally, better than the prominence in terms of loudness<br/>that I postulated.</p><p>Nonetheless, I see no reason to regard this as having simply replaced<br/>it as an explanation. There is nothing mutually exclusive about these<br/>two phenonema, and I believe Terhardt&apos;s explanation is the primary<br/>contributor and that the very significant prominence in terms of<br/>loudness of these lower harmonics is a secondary but still quite<br/>significant contributor as well. I sure hear them much more loudly<br/>than I do other harmonics in most of the harmonic timbres with which<br/>I&apos;m familiar.</p><p>These first few harmonics are also easier to pick out because of the<br/>greater pitch distance between them, since the pitch distance between<br/>successive harmonics decreases logarithmically with the order of the<br/>harmonic. This, I would conjecture, is a third important contributor.</p></div><h3><a id=32401 href="#32401">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2002 5:49:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I adjusted the size of the interval, little by little (without<br/>&gt; &gt; looking), until I heard a certain high-pitched beating come to<br/>&gt; &gt; a stop<br/>&gt; &gt; (well, as close as I could manage) -- so it _had_ to be the<br/>&gt; &gt; coinciding overtones. Look at the dB decay of sawtooth waves --<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; 17th harmonic is only about 12 dB (I think) quieter than the<br/>&gt; &gt; fundamental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: In <a href="/tuning/topicId_31805.html#32046">/tuning/topicId_31805.html#32046</a><br/>&gt; it appears that you use &quot;sawtooth&quot; to describe a repeating<br/>&gt; &quot;ramp&quot; waveform (as opposed to describing a &quot;triangle&quot; wave.<br/>&gt; In that post (where you pointed out my error regarding the<br/>&gt; rate of &quot;roll-off&quot; with increasing frequency in the amplitude<br/>&gt; of the partials of a &quot;triangle&quot; wave), we seem to agree that<br/>&gt; the &quot;sawtooth&quot; waveform &quot;rolls-off&quot; at rate of -6 dB / octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With decibels (scaled to describe current, voltage, or sound<br/>&gt; pressure levels, as opposed to sound *power* levels), I get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Amplitude of 17th harmonic = 20*(LOG_10 (1/17)) = -24.61 dB</p><p>Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The identity 10*(LOG_10 (1/17)) would be appropriate only<br/>&gt; if the *power* (equal to the square of SPL, current, voltage,<br/>&gt; etc) of spectral components (the harmonics) decreased in a<br/>&gt; manner inversely proportional to the change in frequency.</p><p>Well, the point is that the beating between the 17th harmonic of one<br/>sawtooth and the 13th harmonic of the other _is_ audible, even at a<br/>moderate volume. David Canright did similar investigations and got<br/>similar results. Try it yourself, if you can!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;. . . but I&apos;ll also be able to show you that they don&apos;t explain<br/>&gt; &gt; everything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Cogent facts are always welcome.</p><p>For one thing, you might want to examine the early archives of the<br/>harmonic entropy list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: I&apos;ve looked a bit at Terhardt&apos;s texts relating to the<br/>&gt; Laplace/Fourier stuff, and his concepts of applying the<br/>&gt; Fourier integral more appropriately for &quot;shorter-term&quot;<br/>&gt; algorithms approaching a (sort of) &quot;real-time&quot; status.</p><p>Cool. I don&apos;t know much about this stuff, but I think it&apos;s important<br/>to grasp the general gist.</p><p>&gt; Since you seem to have covered Terhardt&apos;s material so<br/>&gt; comprehensively - what texts on his website do you feel<br/>&gt; best address your ideas of &quot;how our ears work&quot; (if that<br/>&gt; may be where some of these ideas are found)?</p><p>On his website? Well, ignorning that bit, besides the Hall and<br/>Roederer books I already mentioned, you should read the Parncutt<br/>book _Harmony: A Psychoacoustical Approach_ and try to extrapolate<br/>beyond Parncutt&apos;s strict 12-tET presentation.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is to note that it seems *not* to be the numbers<br/>involved<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the ratios which describe the interval between two<br/>pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounded (whether they be fundamentals or overtones of<br/>such),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the (expected, and describable) effects of the<br/>acoustical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; summation of nearby frequencies present into a coherent<br/>whole.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The latter often implies the former.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; JG: If only such implications amounted to explanations...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The simpler the ratio between two frequencies (assuming it&apos;s<br/>&gt;simpler<br/>&gt; &gt; than, say, 11:9), the more easily the two pitches will be heard<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; possess _commonality_, since, as we&apos;ve seen, the pitches evoked<br/>by &gt;a<br/>&gt; &gt; frequency are all in simple harmonic/subharmonic relationships<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; one another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: So you *do* consider &quot;subharmonic&quot; relationships to be<br/>&gt; significant in the perception of a &quot;harmonic&quot; spectra? You<br/>&gt; had seemed (to me) to restrict its significance in prior<br/>&gt; communication to applications involving (3 or more tone)<br/>&gt; &quot;utonal&quot; chords.</p><p>On the contrary, I see subharmonic relationships as becoming<br/>_limited_ in their value in chords of 3 or more tones.</p><p>&gt; Would you then look at a harmonic series<br/>&gt; from the perspective of *other* spectral components than<br/>&gt; the fundamental &quot;pitch&quot; (used here to attempt to address<br/>&gt; your sense of a &quot;pitch&quot; arising out of *one* &quot;spectral<br/>&gt; component&quot; out of a group of spectral components)?</p><p>If you think I or Terhardt are trying to imply that the sense of<br/>pitch arises from *one* spectral component out of a group of<br/>spectral components, you&apos;re sorely mistaken. Did you really read the<br/>Terhardt stuff, for example, the &quot;strike note of bells&quot; page? Also,<br/>go to your library and read the relevant chapter or two or three in<br/>the Hall book.</p><p>&gt; &gt;That&apos;s because the whole virtual pitch mechanism seems<br/>&gt; &gt; to be _designed_ to deal with harmonic overtone series, perhaps<br/>an<br/>&gt; &gt; evolutionary advantage, related to the fact that human (and<br/>other)<br/>&gt; &gt; voices have harmonic overtones, or perhaps something acquired<br/>&gt; &gt; prenatally via exposure to the mother&apos;s voice . . . in any case,<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; reality and properties of the virtual pitch phenomenon have been<br/>&gt; &gt; demonstrated in experiment after experiment, and remains a<br/>thriving<br/>&gt; &gt; area of research today, as some list members can attest . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Where else (other than Terhardt) have you seen published<br/>&gt; references to &quot;virtual pitch&quot;? Any authors come to mind? It<br/>&gt; might be instructive if you could post a &quot;bibliography&quot; of<br/>&gt; such papers.</p><p>Every reputable account of psychoacoustics talks about it!! Just<br/>start with some good intros like Roederer and Hall and follow the<br/>references from there!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does it not seem that a &quot;harmonic theory of tonal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;combinations&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would appear to be applicable in the case of *harmonic*<br/>tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but might well be *inapplicable* to combinations of small<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of *sinusoidal* tones?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can the case be made that combinations of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small numbers of *sinusoidal* tones can predict the<br/>effects of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combinations of similarly tuned *complex* tones (with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;harmonics)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two situations could be made absolutely identical and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indistinguishable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Sounds like &quot;magic&quot; to me!   :)</p><p>It&apos;s simply &quot;Fourier synthesis&quot;, or whatever you want to call it!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; JG: That&apos;s a rather tall order to fill, it seems. I guess<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that you would necessarily assume that if it were to be the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; case that &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; is independent of waveform ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It has nothing do do with harmonic entropy. I&apos;m merely referring<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; the mathematical equivalence of a description in terms of<br/>complex<br/>&gt; &gt; tones and a description in terms of sine waves. Certainly I&apos;m<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; claiming that these effects are timbre-independent!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In &quot;harmonic_entropy&quot; message #531, you said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; Waveform has nothing to do with it. Harmonic entropy is the<br/>simplest possible model of consonance<br/>&gt; and cannot be regarded as specific to any waveform. &gt;&gt;</p><p>That was about harmonic entropy. Here, we&apos;re not talking about<br/>harmonic entropy at all! This is a blatant case of taking things out<br/>of context! Can we forget about harmonic entropy for the purposes of<br/>this discussion? If you can&apos;t, at least treat harmonic entropy as an<br/>embryonic plaything that attempts to capture one of Terhardt&apos;s two<br/>components of dissonance -- that&apos;s all it is. Read my next paragraph<br/>before replying to this one.</p><p>&gt; It would *seem* that the question of whether<br/>&gt; or not the case can be made that &quot;combinations<br/>&gt; of small numbers of *sinusoidal* tones can predict the effects of<br/>&gt; combinations of similarly tuned *complex* tones (with harmonics)&quot;<br/>&gt; would be highly relevant to whether &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; can be<br/>&gt; utilized in the characterization of &quot;harmonic timbres&quot;!...</p><p>Jeremy, I thought you were talking about something different. If you<br/>simply remove all the upper partials of the complex tones, clearly<br/>you are not faced with the same sound you had before. In harmonic<br/>entropy I would use a much larger s value for the no-upper-partial<br/>case, as I&apos;ve explained before. But I thought you were talking about<br/>the equivalence of a representation using _many_ sine-wave<br/>components and a representation using _few_ complex tones. I was<br/>merely saying that yes, these are equivalent views (per Fourier).<br/>Sorry for the confusion!</p></div>
