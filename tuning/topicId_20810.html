As<br/>you know, there were many attempts to join together light and sound by a<br/>number of composers, most notably by Scriabin, who advocated for a color<br/>organ in his &quot;Prometheus&quot; and who developed his system of correspondence<br/>between the colors and the different pitch keys. In fact, in Russia there is<br/>a whole society devoted to the study of the different types of artistic<br/>attempts at merging sound and color, which resulted in a lot of concerts and<br/>festivals, not to mention publications on the subject. My guess is that<br/>there are _many_ different ways of merging together the sound world and the<br/>light world, and you can&apos;t stick to just one system (like Scriabin&apos;s or<br/>anyone else&apos;s) as the only correct one, but appreciate each one as an<br/>independent artistic statement.</p><p>I think that light does have a kind of visual &quot;timbres&quot; and we don&apos;t always<br/>see &quot;pure&quot; colors, but sometimes we see pure ones, while at other times we<br/>see &quot;mixed&quot; and &quot;diluted&quot; ones - just like we don&apos;t always hear &quot;pure&quot;<br/>sinewaves or &quot;pure&quot; orchestral sounds - sometimes they are pure, and at<br/>other times they are well blended with each other. As your question is sort<br/>of ambiguous, and may even have a humorous connotation to it (though I can&apos;t<br/>figure out if this is really the case), this answer is the best one that I<br/>could give at the moment - though the question is an interesting one, and<br/>worth musing and philosophizing on at length, which we can continue to do so<br/>at our leisure.</p></div>
