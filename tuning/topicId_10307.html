Without<br/>having done formal mathematical<br/>analyses on various aspects of the<br/>effects of tuning variations on the<br/>intervals, I&apos;ve gained the impression<br/>that tuning deviations for both<br/>melodic and harmonic intervals become<br/>increasingly noticeable as they grow<br/>larger and that both are important to<br/>the musical effect created.  I&apos;ve also<br/>observed that the locations of mistunings<br/>from what is expected (especially for songs)<br/>greatly affect how they are perceived - as<br/>sounding flattish or sounding fine, etc. -<br/>e.g. if a melodic line has a high point - as<br/>in the second line of &quot;Flow Gently, Sweet Afton&quot;,<br/>where the melody climbs to a fifth above the<br/>tonic - a D5 in the key of G - any kind of<br/>deviation which tends to flatten that peak note<br/>will stand out (in this case and at this point<br/>sounding &quot;off&quot; in mean tone temperament, like<br/>a basketball which almost, but doesn&apos;t quite<br/>travel high enough to make it into the basket.</p><p>    I believe the whole matter of musical effects<br/>of variations of intervals is complex and is affected<br/>by quite a few different things.</p></div>
