While my contribution might or<br/>might not fit the expected agenda as implied by the dialogue I&apos;ve seen<br/>so far, I hope that at least it may lend another perspective both on<br/>history and current practices.</p><p>Part of the discussion, as Paul and Joe have indicated, is an attempt<br/>to understand history and to &quot;get things in the right order,&quot; so to<br/>speak. Here I hope I can help, as invited, but should caution that as<br/>has been well said, viewing history is a matter of one&apos;s frame of<br/>reference.</p><p>From my own perspective, &quot;classical&quot; often means the music of Gothic<br/>Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries based on Pythagorean tuning, and<br/>an outstanding size for a relatively small tuning circle or<br/>quasi-circle in the modern fashion is 17. Thus one of my favorite<br/>questions is &quot;Why 17?&quot; -- and with the benefit of some enlightening<br/>discussions with George Secor, whose superb 17-tone well-temperament<br/>is a topic on which we look forward to publishing forthcoming<br/>articles, here are some brief answers:</p><p>           (1) Melodically, there&apos;s an ideal contrast of sizes<br/>               between whole-tones and diatonic semitones;</p><p>           (2) Harmonically, there&apos;s an excellent contrast<br/>               between perfect concords (fifths and fourths)<br/>               and imperfect concords (thirds and sixths, and<br/>               also major seconds and minor sevenths), promoting<br/>               ideally efficient and compelling cadential action.</p><p>           (3) Intervals such as thirds and sixths have three<br/>               basic types -- major, minor, and middle or<br/>               neutral -- for lots of satisfying variety with<br/>               relatively few notes, especially in an unequal<br/>               circle or &quot;orbit,&quot; either a just intonation<br/>               scheme or a well-temperament.</p><p>Note that this explanation, as applied either to a 17-note<br/>well-temperament or equal temperament, or to a more eccentric &quot;17-note<br/>orbit&quot; where each whole-tone is divided into three diatonic semitones<br/>but some fifths might be up to a 64:63 comma wider than 3:2, assumes<br/>certain musical and stylistic patterns.</p><p>The evident musical and stylistic assumptions of a Western European<br/>musician such as Corelli or Werckmeister around 1680 are quite<br/>different, and logically result in a different approach to tuning<br/>systems.</p><p>Having alerted readers to some of my biases, as well as emphasized<br/>that musical and tuning solutions are as much fashion statements as<br/>deductions of logic, I&apos;ll try to cover a few points about historical<br/>and modern scales and tunings.</p><p>First, for the questions &quot;Why 7?&quot; and &quot;Why 12?&quot; I would say that one<br/>short answer has been provided by Ervin Wilson: these sizes are among<br/>those defining a &quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; (MOS) where a tuning system has<br/>reached a point of poise with two sizes of adjacent steps.</p><p>As has been pointed out, diatonic modes or octave species with seven<br/>notes have played a role in various traditions, with the relationship<br/>between two similar or identical tetrachords an important factor.<br/>The ancient Greek and medieval Near Eastern traditions, as well as the<br/>modes of Byzantine and Gregorian chant, illustrate this point.</p><p>As the variety of interval sizes and ratios for diatonic scales in<br/>these traditions might also illustrate, the &quot;7-note&quot; concept can have<br/>appeal in a variety of tuning systems.</p><p>However, as I&apos;ll be repeatedly emphasizing, &quot;Why 7?&quot; doesn&apos;t<br/>necessarily imply &quot;Why _only_ 7?&quot; Even in Gregorian chant, a kind of<br/>ideal type for a music based on diatonic modality, pieces may often<br/>involve _8_ notes per octave, with B/Bb alternating as forms of<br/>a fluid degree, with both forms to be considered part of the regular<br/>medieval gamut (_musica recta_).</p><p>In the Western European compositional tradition, the development from<br/>7 or 8 to 12 and beyond took place largely in the setting of<br/>Pythagorean tuning, which I&apos;d call the most successful just intonation<br/>system in the history of this tradition.</p><p>By around 1200, composers of polyphonic music such as Perotin were<br/>using an expanded gamut of 11 notes per octave, not only the _musica<br/>recta_ gamut of Bb-B, but the additional accidentals Eb, F#, and C#.<br/>These additional notes came to be termed _musica ficta_, which one<br/>might translate as &quot;invented&quot; music or notes.</p><p>From one perspective, we might regard the 13th century as the choice<br/>era of &quot;modal&quot; polyphony, since many sophisticated compositions for<br/>three or four voices draw their sonorities from the notes of a single<br/>octave species or &quot;mode&quot; of 7 or 8 notes, with the B/Bb alternation<br/>often colorfully in evidence.</p><p>However, this shouldn&apos;t be taken to imply that composers felt<br/>themselves strictly bound to a given 7-note or 8-note set. Around<br/>1300, in fact, Johannes de Grocheio emphasizes the vertical structure<br/>of polyphony and tells us that it is based indeed on octave species,<br/>but not on &quot;modes&quot; in the proper definition of formulas indicating the<br/>beginning, middle, and end of a melody, as in chant.</p><p>Now we come to the 14th century, which marks the expansion of<br/>Pythagorean tuning in this tradition to and beyond 12 notes.</p><p>In the decades after 1300, one vital factor mandating the regular and<br/>routine use of accidentals is the ideal of &quot;closest approach,&quot; with an<br/>unstable interval resolving by stepwise contrary motion to the<br/>&quot;nearest&quot; stable concord, one voice moving by a whole-tone and the<br/>other by a compact diatonic semitone. Thus a major third &quot;strives&quot; to<br/>expand to a fifth, and a major sixth to an octave, while a minor third<br/>seeks contraction to a unison.</p><p>As early 14th-century theorists themselves emphasize, obtaining these<br/>closest approach progressions on various degrees requires lots of<br/>accidentalism, as in the following cadence (with C4 as middle C):</p><p>        C#4   D4<br/>        G#3   A3<br/>        E3    D3</p><p>Here we have the lower pair of voices expanding from major third to<br/>fifth, and the outer pair from major sixth to octave -- requiring the<br/>use of C# and G#.</p><p>The historical tuning system for this music, Pythagorean intonation,<br/>very nicely serves this kind of style: the pure fifths and fourths,<br/>active thirds and sixths, and rather compact diatonic semitones all<br/>make &quot;closest approach&quot; effective on the fine level of structure, as<br/>it were. A modern system like a 17-note circle or quasi-circle further<br/>accentuates the latter two qualities, albeit with compromises<br/>regarding the purity of at least some fifths and fourths, and could be<br/>considered as a bit of tasty icing on the intonational cake.</p><p>By sometime around the early to middle 14th century, keyboards were<br/>standardizing on a 12-note layout. A tuning set such as Eb-G# nicely<br/>accommodates most of the vocal repertory of the era, and the earliest<br/>known keyboard music from the Robertsbridge Codex (with proposed dates<br/>ranging from around 1325 to 1365) beautifully fits this complete<br/>12-note range.</p><p>An attraction of 12 is that it is an MOS, with visual symmetry on a<br/>keyboard: each of the five whole-tone steps in a diatonic scale is<br/>divided into two semitones: the diatonic or minor semitone at 256:243<br/>(~90.22 cents) also present at E-F and B-C, and the chromatic or major<br/>semitone at 2187:2048 (~113.69 cents). Thus there are two adjacent<br/>step sizes: the diatonic and chromatic semitones.</p><p>However, by the late 14th century, some composers were not only using<br/>the full resources of 12 but going beyond it: Solage, in his famous<br/>_Fumeux fume_, uses a 15-note set of Gb-G#.</p><p>Two Italian theorists of the early 15th century, Prosdocimus of<br/>Beldemandis and Ugolino of Orvieto, propose a 17-note Pythagorean<br/>tuning of Gb-A# in order to accommodate closest approach cadences<br/>with regular Pythagorean thirds and sixths on a maximum number of<br/>degrees, with the latter advocating a 17-note organ permitting a<br/>discerning player to achieve a perfect intonation of these cadences.</p><p>Like 7 and 12, 17 is an MOS in Pythagorean tuning, with two sizes of<br/>adjacent steps shown in the division of whole-tones (e.g. C-Db-C#-D),<br/>the diatonic semitone (C-Db, C#-D) and the Pythagorean comma at a<br/>ratio of 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents), for example Db-C#.</p><p>An important point about the 14th-century practice I&apos;m discussing -- a<br/>&quot;classic&quot; point of departure for the 21st-century approach in which<br/>I&apos;m involved -- is that beautiful vertical progressions are not<br/>confined to a given &quot;mode&quot; of 7 or 8 notes:</p><p>                 D4  C#4  D4<br/>                 A3  G#3  A3<br/>                 F3  E3   D3</p><p>This progression has a clear and compelling focus of D, but the<br/>sonorities are not all drawn from any 7-note or 8-note diatonic<br/>set. The fluidity of degrees, and flexibility of inflections, is<br/>an important feature both of this historical music and of 21st-century<br/>offshoots in tuning systems such as a 17-note circle or quasi-circle.</p><p>Of course, we might well view such a passage as expressing a kind of<br/>&quot;mode of D,&quot; with inflections to achieve the harmonic goal of closest<br/>approach, and I have no problem in saying that I am playing at once in<br/>&quot;D Dorian&quot; (very freely defined) and in &quot;a focality of D intensive&quot;<br/>(meaning that a final cadence like the above involves ascending<br/>semitones and descending whole-tones).</p><p>An important point is that either the accidentalism of the 14th<br/>century or the chromaticism and enharmonicism of the late 16th century<br/>is much less restrictive than a classical 18th-century key system. All<br/>three approaches, and their 21st-century variations, reflect certain<br/>artistic choices.</p><p>Let&apos;s now consider the order of events for some developments raised in<br/>earlier dialogue.</p><p>During the early and middle 15th century, there is a trend toward the<br/>use of thirds and sixths at or near ratios of 5 -- as reflected and<br/>promoted first by the modified Pythagoraen tunings of around 1400-1450<br/>with written sharps realized as Pythagorean flats (specifically the<br/>12-note keyboard tuning of Gb-B), and then, by around 1450-1480, in<br/>the growing adoption of meantone temperament.</p><p>By around 1500, composers such as Josquin and Isaac are starting<br/>frequently to conclude pieces with sonorities including thirds, and by<br/>the 1520&apos;s, a theorist such as Pietro Aaron is noting a preference<br/>specifically for the major third at certain points, using accidentals<br/>to obtain this interval above the lowest part in closing sonorities.</p><p>Vicentino (1555) and Zarlino (1558) both advocate the use of &quot;rich&quot; or<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; harmony including the third plus the fifth above the lowest<br/>voice -- Zarlino&apos;s _harmonia perfetta_ which he considers basic to a<br/>well-organized composition for three or more voices. In his writings<br/>of 1610 and 1612, Johannes Lippius extols this sonority as the _trias<br/>harmonica_, or &quot;harmonic triad.&quot;</p><p>Here it should be noted that both 7-note and 12-note sets, and indeed<br/>the 17-note set of Prosdocimus and Ugolino, were recognized in a<br/>Pythagorean setting; the concept of saturated 5-limit concord arises,<br/>not surprisingly, in an intonational environment of meantone. Zarlino,<br/>a leading theorist of meantone temperaments for keyboard, suggests<br/>some kind of adaptive 5-limit just intonation is being practiced by<br/>singers or other performers in flexible-pitch ensembles when he<br/>observes that they seem to seek pure concords while avoiding the<br/>problems with &quot;least intervals&quot; such as commas which arise on<br/>keyboards in the syntonic diatonic.</p><p>In a meantone system, MOS sizes are 12, 19, or 31 notes, and in fact<br/>the equal or near-equal 31-note keyboards instruments of Vicentino<br/>(1555), and of Stella and Colonna documented in the latter&apos;s treatise<br/>(1618), as well as the keyboard of Costeley based on 19-note equal<br/>temperament (1570), illustrate the latter sizes for a circulating<br/>system.</p><p>However, while Colonna includes in his treatise an &quot;example of<br/>circulation&quot; cadencing on all 31 steps of his instrument by<br/>circumnavigating the circle of fifths, circulation is not a theme of<br/>most Renaissance and Manneristic music. Thus 19-note keyboards tuned<br/>in 1/4-comma meantone or the like (where 31 notes would be required<br/>for a circulating system) were popular in Naples around 1600.</p><p>Additionally, various keyboards had a usual 12-note design enhanced by<br/>&quot;split keys&quot; for certain additional meantone accidentals: the<br/>accidental keys might be divided so that front and back portions<br/>produce G#/Ab and Eb/D#.</p><p>As already mentioned, a vital feature of music around 1600, whether<br/>routine or highly &quot;experimental,&quot; is the flexible use of accidentals,<br/>with the fluidity of steps such as B/Bb or C/C# routine.</p><p>Thus I might explain the late 17th-century practice of major/minor<br/>tonality, codified in the early 18th century by theorists such as<br/>Rameau, as reflecting a certain choice of materials -- in some ways a<br/>considerably more restricted choice than the chromaticism of the<br/>Manneristic era around 1540-1640, let alone the fifthtone<br/>enharmonicism of a Vicentino or Colonna.</p><p>As Paul and Jerry have discussed, a central feature of major/minor<br/>tonality is the role of the tritone or diminished fifth as an interval<br/>resolving by stepwise contrary motion to a third or sixth. This kind<br/>of resolution, routine in 16th-century practice and theory, becomes<br/>the defining element of key.</p><p>An important point about 14th-century accidentalism, as well as<br/>16th-century chromaticism or 18th-century tonality, is that these<br/>practices are defined as much by characteristic vertical progressions<br/>as by a choice of &quot;scales.&quot;</p><p>What happens intonationally around 1680, as others have noted, is that<br/>the desire for free transpositions _with a limited number of notes_<br/>leads to the popularity of 12-note well-temperaments such as<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s.</p><p>Obviously a 31-note meantone system such as that of Vicentino or<br/>Colonna in the Manneristic era, or of Huygens in this same late<br/>17th-century era, would permit free transpositions also -- with such<br/>added possibilities as closely approximated ratios of 7, and various<br/>neutral types of intervals.</p><p>One lesson of world musics is that there are a wide range of natural<br/>and beautiful solutions, with Western Europe in the 14th or 18th<br/>century merely as one example.</p><p>Trying to articulate some of the &quot;explanations&quot; for intonational<br/>choices may help us better to understand not only the roads taken, but<br/>the roads not taken and open to fruitful exploration.</p><p>Of course, an acquaintance with the natural and beautiful scalar and<br/>intonational systems of a range of world musics, for example the many<br/>neutral intervals of medieval or modern Near Eastern music and the<br/>slendro and pelog scales of Javanese or Balinese gamelan, brings home<br/>the point that there are many artistically compelling choices.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=35975 href="#35975">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2002 5:16:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jjensen142000&quot; &lt;jjensen14@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_35909.html#35909">/tuning/topicId_35909.html#35909</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; I would be interested in reading any comments that you might have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; regards,<br/>&gt; Jeff</p><p>Hello Jeff!</p><p>Finally I had a chance to study through your page, and it was really<br/>interesting for me to see it from the perspective you were driving<br/>at.

Remark: This is<br/>what we propose as the basic definition of a musical scale.&quot;</p><p>Historically it was, I believe, the other way around, with chords<br/>being derived from *melodies.*  So the *melody* was really the &quot;a<br/>priori&quot; and the harmonies gradually evolved from that.</p><p>At least, that&apos;s *my* understanding, and I believe it is significant<br/>to understanding a scale.  After all, many cultures use scales<br/>without any harmonies at all!</p><p>It seemed to me that your puzzlement on why certain notes like C# and<br/>F# were more &quot;dissonant&quot; to C than notes like F and G was a little on<br/>the &quot;baroque&quot; side, and I don&apos;t mean the *period!*</p><p>I believe a simple reference to the circle of fifths and the<br/>increasingly complicated ratios of the &quot;black notes&quot; would<br/>easily &quot;solve&quot; this riddle without a necessary reference to sensory<br/>consonance curves although, admittedly, this was interesting [and the<br/>applets, again, the best part!  :) ]</p><p>Finally, since you cited the Backus book, you might want to look on<br/>page 126 where he presents a just intonation chromatic scale in a<br/>somewhat similar way to the one *you* presented, maybe with a couple<br/>of different conventions.</p><p>His &quot;set up&quot; uses a just major third between D-F#, and just minor<br/>triads on C and G and just major triads on E and A.  He shows the<br/>varying syntonic comma differences from Pythagorean as plusses and<br/>minuses as such:</p><p>C0, C#-2, D0, Eb+1, E-1, F0, F#-1, G0, [G#-2,Ab+1], A-1, Bb+1, B-1, C0</p><p>Of course, one of the big &quot;bugbears&quot; is the two choices between G#<br/>and Ab but, as you mention yourself, even the fifth D0:A-1 is &quot;out of<br/>tune&quot; in this setup.</p><p>By the way, these notations correspond pretty much to the kind of<br/>notation used by American Just Intonation composer Ben Johnston.</p><p>He uses plusses and minuses for commas in this way.</p><p>HOWEVER, these are used in a *more consistent* way by Joe Monzo, Dan<br/>Wolf in a notation called HEWM, based upon a *Pythagorean* derivation.</p><p>What that means is that a simple just intonation triad based on C<br/>would be written C0:E-1:G0, showing the comma right &quot;off the bat&quot; in<br/>reference to the scale degrees shown on our traditional staff, which<br/>is descended from Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>The *minor* in this case would be the &quot;reverse&quot; as far as the commas<br/>go, and would be more consistent in HEWM as well, being shown as:</p><p>E-1:G0:B-1</p><p>The fifths in the HEWM system, would always have the same sign, which<br/>is important for consistency&apos;s sake.</p><p>More information on this interesting system partially developed by<br/>Joe Monzo can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/hewm.htm</a></p><p>Well... Joe *tried* to make it understandable.  It&apos;s just *very,<br/>very* deep...:)</p><p>Oh, and while I&apos;m on the topic of Joe&apos;s very substantial<br/>contributions, you might want to listen to a page where he tunes up<br/>various just intonation chords in a simple I-IV-V7-I progression.</p><p>This is one of my *own* very favorite pages of all time.</p><p>I think theory teachers should be *required* to listen to this page<br/>before they enter a classroom!

As an outsider to the discussion, I have the  impression that in<br/>the Jeff Jensen&apos;s paper there is a strong teleological bias that remind me<br/>the (false) view of &quot;evolution ladder&quot; in evolution theory. Many authors<br/>such as Stephen J. Gould (in books like &quot;The Panda Thumb&quot;) point out the<br/>fact that such a bias impede a clear view of biological evolution mechanism.<br/>History of music may also suffer too simple causal view such as :</p><p>&gt; Harmonics ==&gt; JI,<br/>&gt; JI + (uncontrollable urge to change keys) ==&gt; 12tet</p><p>We should take care to not oversimplify causal chains, otherwise, we may as<br/>well conclude that cooling of the climate killed the dinosaurs as well as JI<br/>(see below ;-) ).</p><p>It would be like stating (has it has been) that a big brain is clear<br/>tendency of evolution, or that dinosaur disappeared because they were not<br/>fit etc. etc. The &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; theory states that brutal changes<br/>in environment may kill extremely well adapted life forms (like dinosaurs)<br/>and give an unexpected chance to up-to-then marginal organism for reason<br/>that are more linked to mere luck that to any simple causal relationship<br/>(warm blood mammal where &quot;better&quot; fitted for climate change).</p><p>Punctual events (at the geological scale) can change course of evolution in<br/>unpredictable ways. That should be a lesson for history of music and history<br/>in general. In this sense, the Pythagorean scale is a very &quot;successful&quot;<br/>system, but that does not necessarily imply that it is &quot;better&quot; than any<br/>other scale. The fact that Pythagorean scale leads, by the circle of fifth,<br/>to &quot;out-of-tune&quot; thirds, had a clear and decisive influence on development<br/>of medieval polyphony. Nevertheless, the Pythagorean scale is an<br/>intellectual construction based on the Pythagorean faith stating that the<br/>real world is just an imperfect shadow of a &quot;perfect&quot; mathematical universe.<br/>Other clever intellectual constructs, based on other philosophical view<br/>could have lead to a completely different musical system as Margo Schulter<br/>conclude in her wonderful posting:</p><p>&gt; One lesson of world musics is that there are a wide range of natural<br/>&gt; and beautiful solutions, with Western Europe in the 14th or 18th<br/>&gt; century merely as one example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Trying to articulate some of the &quot;explanations&quot; for intonational<br/>&gt; choices may help us better to understand not only the roads taken, but<br/>&gt; the roads not taken and open to fruitful exploration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, an acquaintance with the natural and beautiful scalar and<br/>&gt; intonational systems of a range of world musics, for example the many<br/>&gt; neutral intervals of medieval or modern Near Eastern music and the<br/>&gt; slendro and pelog scales of Javanese or Balinese gamelan, brings home<br/>&gt; the point that there are many artistically compelling choices.</p><p>There is more than simple causal relationship to explain history. There is a<br/>sort of &quot;co-evolution&quot; (to borrow a term of evolution theory) between<br/>musical theory, musical practice, musical taste, instrument technique and<br/>instrument making.</p><p>For instance, if the keyboard instruments have not been the preeminent<br/>instruments for many centuries in Europe, tuning and temperament would have<br/>been a lesser issue. E contrario, a cappella Italian madrigal of around 1600<br/>was a laboratory for quite audacious modulation; those &quot;experimentations&quot;<br/>disappeared as a cappella genres went out of fashion (by the way, try to<br/>play Gesualdo &quot;morro lasso&quot; on a 12ET piano, it give an insight why it is a<br/>cappella).</p><p>Other example: throughout 19th century, instrument makers had to cope with<br/>demand for power and roundness (e.g.: look at the history of piano making).<br/>Matter of factly, concert halls became bigger and bigger, but it is<br/>difficult to state if it was because instruments were more powerful or the<br/>other way around. Singing technique also evolved to keep in pace with those<br/>big powerful orchestras: eventually singers learned to sing slightly<br/>out-of-tune to not be totally masked by the orchestra. New singing technique<br/>came with a large vibrato that blur the pitch and make the &quot;out-of-tunness&quot;<br/>much less obvious. But is there is a simple causal relationship that goes<br/>from climate change to 12ET tuning ? :-) :</p><p>Climate cooling in Europe =&gt; starvation in France =&gt; French Revolution =&gt;<br/>democratization of music =&gt; larger concert hall =&gt; larger orchestras =&gt; new<br/>singing technique =&gt; need to sing below the pitch in a controlled manner =&gt;<br/>large vibrato to blur the pitch =&gt; lack of taste for just intonation =&gt; 12ET<br/>tuning !!!</p><p>That is certainly not the way it goes. Co-evolution seems here to be a more<br/>productive concept (e.g. large vibrato is a side effect of the new singing<br/>technique, not a goal). Everything change little by little but many effects<br/>(of more or less musical nature) can change course of things.</p><p>Other example: There were many attempt throughout the last centuries up to<br/>now to design keyboards with more than 12 keys by octave. In parallel,<br/>fingering technique co-evolved with standard 7 whites / 5 black keyboard up<br/>to a point that by the time of Bach (or little afterward) the technical<br/>standard for keyboard players became so high that it become less and less<br/>likely that the same virtuosity could be achieved with alternate keyboard<br/>design (vita brevis, ars longa). In this case, the taste for virtuosity<br/>provided an &quot;environment&quot; where the 7W/5B keyboard is so well &quot;fitted&quot; that<br/>there is no &quot;niche&quot; for other life-forms.... Further there are probably some<br/>economical reasons for standardized keyboard design.</p><p>Other example: Throughout 19th century, piano makers &quot;optimized&quot; the design<br/>in a way that mostly kill the harmonics greater than 7 or so (by choosing<br/>cleverly the place where the hammer hit the string). This had three major<br/>effect:<br/>- The sound is subjectively &quot;rounder&quot;.<br/>- The energy of &quot;killed&quot; high harmonics is not lost but transferred to lower<br/>harmonics to which the human ear is much more sensitive. Thus the kinetic<br/>energy of the hammer is efficiently transformed in a subjectively &quot;louder&quot;<br/>sound.<br/>- As a side effect, in chords, the relative energy of the beating harmonics<br/>is lesser than for, let say, harpsichord.</p><p>Roundness is matter of taste. Search of power is a general trend in<br/>instrument making trough 19th an 20th century. The side effect on chords<br/>makes ET much more tolerable on piano than on harpsichord (at least to my<br/>opinion). If that is true, the tone of the new dominant keyboard may had an<br/>influence (but not as a single cause) in emergence of 12ET.</p><p>My viewpoint is from a quite naive dilettante, especially when compared to<br/>the deep, comprehensive postings of Margo Schulter. Nevertheless, Margo&apos;s<br/>posting shows that we should not give up understanding history of tuning<br/>even though there is no simple causal relationship.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&iuml;&iquest;&half;ois Laferri&iuml;&iquest;&half;re</p></div><h3><a id=36133 href="#36133">ðŸ”—</a>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2002 11:04:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Francois.

We find it<br/>used in the monochord of Ramos (1482), who recommends its simpler<br/>ratios for students who find the Pythagorean proportions difficult to<br/>follow, and by the great Italian philosopher Ficino shortly<br/>thereafter, who praises the &quot;sweetness&quot; of the third in the proportion<br/>sesquiquarta (5:4).</p><p>However, from practice as well as theory, I might ask, &quot;Why not JI<br/>based, for example, on ratios of 3 and 7, with imperfect concords such<br/>as 7:6, 7:4, 9:7, and 12:7?&quot;</p><p>Whether or not the system of vocal intonation for cadences described<br/>and advocated by Marchettus of Padua in his _Lucidarium_ (1318) was<br/>anything like this -- unfortunately there are not any tape recordings<br/>or computer audio files for your adept analysis -- his ideal of<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; certainly could result in some performers<br/>approximating these ratios of 7.</p><p>Here I can at least speak for myself. In 1998, when John Chalmers<br/>remarked to me that a Pythagorean tuning sufficiently extended will<br/>emulate ratios of 7, I associated these ratios with the cadences of<br/>Marchettus, which seem to call for narrower semitones, and wider major<br/>thirds and sixths, than the usual Pythagorean intervals. This meeting<br/>of early 14th-century theory and a late 20th-century observation by a<br/>leading xenharmonic scholar together led me to practical 24-note<br/>tuning systems based on a Pythagorean chain.</p><p>Here, too, there has been a bit of &quot;evolutionary branching.&quot; I started<br/>with a regular 24-note Pythagorean tuning on two keyboards a<br/>Pythagorean comma apart (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents), where the<br/>near-7 steps and intervals differ from their pure 7-based ratios by<br/>about 3.80 cents.</p><p>Later the idea came to me, with some inspiration from participants<br/>here such as Graham Breed, of slightly modifying the distance between<br/>the keyboards to a 64:63 (~27.26 cents), thus obtaining pure ratios of<br/>3 and 7.</p><p>Then I came to experiment with other distances, including a system<br/>with the two keyboards a pure 7:6 (~266.87 cents) apart, one leading<br/>to a kind of 21st-century variation on early 15th-century<br/>fauxbourdon, with chains of parallel 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24<br/>sonorities eventually resolving cadentially to a pure 3:2 fifth or<br/>complete 2:3:4.</p><p>There are many open questions: for example, to what degree might my<br/>choice of electronic timbres (or, to a considerable degree, the choice<br/>of the synthesizer designer to include certain preset voices)<br/>facilitate the use of certain interval sizes or ratios that might be<br/>less palatable with the prevailing timbres in Europe around 1400, for<br/>example?</p><p>&gt; Punctual events (at the geological scale) can change course of<br/>&gt; evolution in unpredictable ways. That should be a lesson for history<br/>&gt; of music and history in general.</p><p>Of course, with musical evolution, we are dealing with a form of what<br/>might be termed &quot;artificial selection,&quot; or more specifically, artistic<br/>selection, also known as fashion.</p><p>Certainly fashion has its vagaries, a theme of much wisdom and humor.</p><p>At the same time, to use your geological and biological metaphor, I<br/>would say that there can indeed be &quot;punctuated evolution&quot; in music and<br/>intonation also. During the last couple of years, I seem to be living<br/>in a kind of Ediacarian/Cambrian &quot;explosion&quot; of tuning systems,<br/>intervals, and progressions.</p><p>One might possibly say that I happen to be exploring a largely open<br/>&quot;niche&quot;: tunings systems and musics where major thirds of around<br/>408-440 cents, and minor thirds of around 260-294 cents, are the usual<br/>and highly esteemed sizes, with progressions often following Gothic<br/>patterns of the kind described by Marchettus and others.</p><p>Such systems could have evolved in a 15th-16th century European milieu<br/>with different musical tastes, or in an early 20th-century xenharmonic<br/>setting with more of a &quot;neo-medieval&quot; inclination. Why this should<br/>actually happen around the end of the 20th century, I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>However, whatever the reasons, the kind of &quot;unpredictable&quot; changes you<br/>mention are also something I have experienced.</p><p>In June of 2000, for example, I got the idea of a tuning in which the<br/>whole-tone and diatonic semitone would have a ratio of sizes equal to<br/>Euler&apos;s e, about 2.71828, leading to a fifth of around 704.61 cents.<br/>This was just a pleasant mathematical emblem, and also a kind of<br/>intuition that this might be an interesting region of the spectrum.</p><p>By accident, I discovered that this tuning had augmented seconds and<br/>diminished fourths not too far from the ratios of 17:14 (~336.13<br/>cents) and 21:17 (~365.83 cents), and that I loved the effect of these<br/>thirds in cadential progressions. These intervals then became part of<br/>my intonational practice and theory, and a highly valued attraction of<br/>a new or unfamiliar tuning system.</p><p>Such fortuitous developments can occur in various musical<br/>&quot;bioenvironments.&quot; For example, Mark Lindley has suggested that the<br/>French _temperament ordinaire_ of the later 17th and 18th centuries<br/>may have grown out of a misunderstanding as to the technique for<br/>tuning the flats in a regular meantone scheme.</p><p>Lindley observes in tuning a chain of meantone fifths such as<br/>C-G-D-A-E, the upper note must be lowered to make the fifth slightly<br/>narrower than pure. In adding the usual flats of an Eb-G# tuning,<br/>however, one must similarly temper the fifths in the narrow direction<br/>by _raising_ the _lower_ note of the fifth (Bb-F, Eb-Bb). However,<br/>some tuners may have mistaken the instructions to call for a downward<br/>adjustment, making the fifths Eb-Bb-F _wider_ than pure, and<br/>mitigating the usual meantone Wolf G#-Eb, or even making it a<br/>comfortable fifth.</p><p>However it may have originated, this system led to the artful<br/>exploitation of a composer such as Couperin, analyzed by Lindley --<br/>for example, the special treatment of some remote major thirds rather<br/>larger than Pythagorean. In a neo-Gothic tuning of the early 21st<br/>century, thirds of this size might define the routine and ideal norm,<br/>but in a late 17th-century setting, they are &quot;strange&quot; and thus a<br/>notable special effect contrasting with the norm of meantone-like<br/>major thirds closer to 5:4.</p><p>&gt; There is more than simple causal relationship to explain<br/>&gt; history. There is a sort of &quot;co-evolution&quot; (to borrow a term of<br/>&gt; evolution theory) between musical theory, musical practice, musical<br/>&gt; taste, instrument technique and instrument making.</p><p>As noted above, I find this a beautiful metaphor, and the question of<br/>Gesualdo and keyboard instruments that you raise is something I would<br/>like to comment on a bit in order further to support your main<br/>thesis. In my view, the somewhat different conclusions I tend to draw<br/>about the possible role of vocal and instrumental performers may serve<br/>to support your basic concept of &quot;co-evolution&quot; yet more strongly.</p><p>First, however, on your vital elements of &quot;musical practice&quot; and<br/>&quot;musical taste,&quot; I might share an amusing story which happened on this<br/>list in September of 2000.</p><p>At that time, the young mathematician and theorist Keenan Pepper<br/>described a regular tuning in which the whole-tone and chromatic<br/>semitone have a ratio of the Golden Section, or Phi, about 1.618034.<br/>This produces a fifth of around 704.10 cents.</p><p>Not so surprisingly, I found this tuning quite delightful, and indeed<br/>a most excellent optimization for four of my favorite ratios (14:11,<br/>13:11, 17:14, 21:17). Delighted both by the ingenious mathematical<br/>concept, and by the result in musical practice, I applauded &quot;Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s wonderful tuning&quot; in many posts exploring its felicities.</p><p>Then, however, Keenan Pepper himself responded by saying that for his<br/>own musical purposes, he didn&apos;t like it: he wanted ratios such 5:4 and<br/>7:4, rather than the more complex ones in a 12-note tuning that moved<br/>me to such enthusiasm.</p><p>&gt; For instance, if the keyboard instruments have not been the<br/>&gt; preeminent instruments for many centuries in Europe, tuning and<br/>&gt; temperament would have been a lesser issue. E contrario, a cappella<br/>&gt; Italian madrigal of around 1600 was a laboratory for quite audacious<br/>&gt; modulation; those &quot;experimentations&quot; disappeared as a cappella<br/>&gt; genres went out of fashion (by the way, try to play Gesualdo &quot;morro<br/>&gt; lasso&quot; on a 12ET piano, it give an insight why it is a cappella).</p><p>Please let me begin by warmly agreeing that Gesualdo&apos;s vocal music<br/>might be ideally performed by an a cappella ensemble, possibly using<br/>some kind of adaptive just intonation. However, to observe that<br/>performances on instruments were reported by writers of the time such<br/>as Doni, and that these pieces might be quite pleasantly performed on<br/>keyboards of the period with 19 or 31 notes per octave in extended<br/>meantone (likely at or near 1/4-comma with pure major thirds), is only<br/>to strengthen your point that musical styles, tuning systems, and<br/>instruments indeed &quot;co-evolve.&quot;</p><p>For example, Doni tells us that in dramatic performances, music might<br/>be played to fit the mood, noting that for a melacholy setting, one<br/>plays a madrigal of the Prince [i.e. Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa] on<br/>the viols.</p><p>Viols, although they are fretted instruments, permit flexible<br/>intonation, rather like voices. Mark Lindley, for example, that the<br/>trick of producing some just sonorities is something mastered by every<br/>&quot;first rate&quot; viol consort that he has heard, and that it is both<br/>possible and often desirable to match a keyboard temperament such as<br/>meantone or a _temperament ordinaire_, as French players in the later<br/>17th century may have done.</p><p>While some kind of adaptive tuning for singers or viols, possibly<br/>mixing characteristics of meantone and just intonation, is one<br/>possibility, the extended meantone keyboards especially popular in the<br/>region of Naples around 1600 would also nicely fit Gesualdo&apos;s music.</p><p>Indeed, although you are quite right to emphasize that music of this<br/>era is much less &quot;keyboard-centered&quot; than that of the 19th century,<br/>for example, Gesualdo himself and others in his general milieu such as<br/>Trabaci were composing keyboard music for instruments such as the<br/>_cembalo chromatico_ or &quot;chromatic harpsichord&quot; with 19 notes per<br/>octave (generally Gb-B#) in 1/4-comma meantone or the like.</p><p>As it happens, Scipione Stella, who built keyboard instruments in<br/>31-note meantone, entered Gesualdo&apos;s service in 1594. His instruments<br/>seem to have influenced Fabio Colonna, who in 1618 described his own<br/>harpsichord with a kind of what might now be called a generalized<br/>keyboard, and included in his treatise a musical piece entitled<br/>&quot;Example of Circulation&quot; in which he cadences on all 31 steps of the<br/>circle of fifths, returning to the opening sonority.</p><p>This makes your main point about co-evolution all the more dramatic: a<br/>12-tET piano can accurately represent the intonational nuances neither<br/>of Gesualdo&apos;s madrigals nor of harpsichord music in extended meantone,<br/>where, in addition to pure or near-pure 5-limit thirds, the unequal<br/>semitones and distinctions between B# and C (the latter a diesis or<br/>fifthtone higher, about 128:125 or 41.06 cents) are important<br/>elements.</p><p>However, as you also may be suggesting here, the limitation of<br/>&quot;standard&quot; keyboards to only 12 notes per octave could play a very<br/>significant role in shaping 17th-century developments. Around<br/>1550-1620, keyboards in extended meantone were a kind of special<br/>delicacy for what might now be described as more &quot;experimental&quot; music.</p><p>When, for whatever reasons, more remote transpositions became a<br/>routine imperative in the major/minor key system established in<br/>practice by around 1670-1700, there were two obvious options: either<br/>keyboards with a large number of notes per octave would become a new<br/>standard (e.g. the 31-note cycle of Huygens), or 12-note tunings would<br/>be adjusted to achieve a largely or completely circulating system, as<br/>with Werckmeister&apos;s well-temperaments.</p><p>As it happens, the taste of the times -- or possibly the economics and<br/>habits of keyboard playing which you describe in the next quoted<br/>passage of your article -- largely sided with Werckmeister rather than<br/>Huygens. This not only set the stage for the music of a genius such as<br/>Bach, but promoted a &quot;closed&quot; 12-note cycle of a kind excluding many<br/>of the creative possibilities of extended meantone as earlier explored<br/>by people such as Vicentino and Gesualdo.</p><p>There are other scenarios one could postulate also in order to<br/>appreciate the evolutionary possibilities. Suppose, for example, that<br/>a 19-note equal temperament had become the norm in the early or middle<br/>17th century, as proposed in 1570 by Costeley -- more notes than 12,<br/>but considerably fewer than the 31 of Vicentino or Stella and Colonna<br/>required to make a 1/4-comma temperament a circulating system.</p><p>While such a 19-note system (either 19-tET or the almost identical<br/>1/3-comma meantone with pure 6:5 minor thirds) would not have the<br/>diesis or fifthtone nuances of 31, it might provide a rather nice<br/>representation of some of Gesualdo&apos;s madrigals, for example --<br/>although 1/4-comma in 19 or more notes seems to me the best choice,<br/>and what was evidently favored on the Neapolitan chromatic<br/>harpsichords with their open 19-note tuning (Gb-B#).</p><p>One could even playfully argue that Zarlino (1571) finds 1/3-comma<br/>somewhat &quot;languid,&quot; maybe nicely fitting the melancholy quality of<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s madrigals noted by Doni, one of this composer&apos;s great<br/>admirers.</p><p>&gt; Other example: There were many attempt throughout the last centuries<br/>&gt; up to now to design keyboards with more than 12 keys by octave. In<br/>&gt; parallel, fingering technique co-evolved with standard 7 whites / 5<br/>&gt; black keyboard up to a point that by the time of Bach (or little<br/>&gt; afterward) the technical standard for keyboard players became so<br/>&gt; high that it become less and less likely that the same virtuosity<br/>&gt; could be achieved with alternate keyboard design (vita brevis, ars<br/>&gt; longa). In this case, the taste for virtuosity provided an<br/>&gt; &quot;environment&quot; where the 7W/5B keyboard is so well &quot;fitted&quot; that<br/>&gt; there is no &quot;niche&quot; for other life-forms.... Further there are<br/>&gt; probably some economical reasons for standardized keyboard design.</p><p>Here, indeed, we have what has sometimes called an &quot;adaptive sink&quot; --<br/>a kind of stasis, in which things seem in such equilibrium that there<br/>is little opportunity for dramatic change -- at least until the next<br/>evolutionary &quot;punctuation.&quot;</p><p>Writing in 1594, Bottrigari tells us that lots of keyboard player&apos;s<br/>were intimidated by Vicentino&apos;s _archicembalo_ with its large number<br/>of notes per octave, although we know that keyboards with some split<br/>accidental keys were more common, and 19-note instruments in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone or the like rather the fashion around Naples.</p><p>There are also modern compromises like using two standard 12-note MIDI<br/>keyboards to map tunings of between 13 and 24 notes. Here it&apos;s<br/>interesting that the schemes I tend to use a lot generally have at<br/>least one of the keyboards in a conventional 12-note arrangement of<br/>some kind (e.g. Pythagorean, meantone, or a regular tuning with wide<br/>fifths), or at least something quite close to it.</p><p>People with generalized keyboards are less likely to be biased in this<br/>way.</p><p>&gt; Roundness is matter of taste. Search of power is a general trend in<br/>&gt; instrument making trough 19th an 20th century. The side effect on<br/>&gt; chords makes ET much more tolerable on piano than on harpsichord (at<br/>&gt; least to my opinion). If that is true, the tone of the new dominant<br/>&gt; keyboard may had an influence (but not as a single cause) in<br/>&gt; emergence of 12ET.</p><p>Here I might just add a couple of related examples. In 1581, Vincenzo<br/>Galilei indeed found 12-tET much more pleasant on lute (where it was a<br/>standard tuning) than on harpsichord, and he discussed some<br/>differences between the material and plucking action on the strings of<br/>the two instruments that might account for this difference.</p><p>Also, it has been suggested that the standard of 12-tET in the late<br/>19th and 20th centuries may have accounted for the limited popularity<br/>of the harmonium with its very prominent partials -- the same<br/>instrument proving a delight, for this very reason, to advocates and<br/>designers of just intonation keyboards.</p><p>Again, thank you for this most gracious and rewarding dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=36194 href="#36194">ðŸ”—</a>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2002 8:52:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

Ideally, the<br/>&gt; applet will be sufficiently modular that it would be possible<br/>&gt; to just plug in a harmonic entropy function, say, and then<br/>&gt; crank out different numbers with that.</p><p>well i wish harmonic entropy were more well-developed. i haven&apos;t even<br/>calculated harmonic entropy for triads yet, let alone larger chords,<br/>but now that i have a new faster computer (750 or 833 MHz or so), i<br/>may have to get back to this project!</p><p>&gt; &gt; tonality means much more than just a set of frequencies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we need a precise list of what it does mean, or at least,<br/>&gt; a first guess (to be refined ) at such a list...</p><p>my 22-tone paper tries to give some rules that make a scale, and<br/>certain of its modes, conducive to tonality . . .</p></div><h3><a id=55167 href="#55167">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2004 1:05:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve started discussing these on <a href="http://xenharmony.org">xenharmony.org</a> if anyone wants to<br/>check it out.</p></div>
