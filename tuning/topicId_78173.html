Indeed I migth have a &gt; closer look at 72edo composing.<br/>&gt;   Thanks to you too... and I should&apos;ve said ajnas (tetrachords and such) instead of maqamat, since I only quoted the Saba tetrachord in F minor at 1:52 and 4:41. The notes, doubled in four octaves are F-Gd-Ab-Bbb. The brief &quot;Rast&quot; section from 3:11 to 3:20, and it repeats the F major trio theme using neutral thirds, sixths and sevenths instead of major.</p><p>I could&apos;ve said Ajam for major, Nihawand for minor and Kurd for Phrygian, but those don&apos;t really count.</p><p>I&apos;m not as good at writing manifestos, so it might not make much sense. Basically, I divide 72-edo into 31 pitch classes corresponding to meantone tuning, or 41-tone to Pythagorean. ~D.</p></div><h3><a id=78201 href="#78201">ðŸ”—</a>shahin mohajeri &#x3C;acousticsoftombak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2008 9:10:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Danny<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Very good , Thanks for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shaahin mohajeri , Tombak player and microtonalist<br/>&nbsp;<br/>My microtonal web site<br/>Shaahin in wikipedia<br/>My farsi page in harmonytalk<br/>Irandrumz ensemble</p></div><h3><a id=78221 href="#78221">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2008 6:10:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Motashakeram!
