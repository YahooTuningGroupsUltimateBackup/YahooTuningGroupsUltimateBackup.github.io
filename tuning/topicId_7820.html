I&apos;d love to know what these phrases<br/>&gt; mean in layman&apos;s English, particularly the first two.

While one may disagree<br/>&gt; with this item or that, I rather like reference works where<br/>&gt; the author&apos;s viewpoint is upfront rather than hidden behind<br/>&gt; some claim of consensus authority. I look forward to watching<br/>&gt; it grow.</p><p>Thanks, Daniel.  I&apos;ve always thought it important to present<br/>a viewpoint as my own (or whomever deserves credit) rather<br/>than as some kind of hidden &apos;corporate&apos; opinion.</p><p>Many people besides John Chalmers have contributed to my<br/>Dictionary entries, including principally Paul Erlich,<br/>and many others on this List.</p><p>I enourage further participation from anyone who feels that<br/>they have something to add to any definition, whether it&apos;s<br/>already in the Dictionary or is yet to be added.  I prefer<br/>to just keep letting the definitions grow as further viewpoints<br/>are submitted, rather than to try to pare them down to<br/>&apos;consensus&apos; definitions, unless I feel that reaching a<br/>consensus is important, in which case I will probably<br/>mention any debates, with their particulars.</p><p>I prefer comments about Dictionary entries to be sent<br/>here to the List, so that they will be immediately open<br/>to public scrutiny before I add them to the Dictionary.<br/>Perhaps the best thing to do is to send one copy to the List<br/>and another to me privately.</p><p>&gt; [Daniel Wolf]<br/>&gt; For me, at least, it would be more useful if it were all<br/>&gt; on a single html page with internal links rather than in<br/>&gt; the one-definition-to-a-page format, which is much slower<br/>&gt; to use.</p><p>In fact, the original Tuning Dictionary *did* have all entries<br/>on a single HTML page.  I liked it better that way too, because<br/>it was easier to maintain and used a *lot* less disk-space,<br/>since I include my standard webpage header and footer for<br/>every single entry.</p><p>But as the number of entries grew, I found *that* format<br/>to be getting too slow to use conveniently, so I decided<br/>to separate each entry into its own webpage.</p><p>Have you tried downloading and extracting the zipped version?<br/>That stores all of the files into a single directory on your<br/>own hard-drive, and would probably be the fastest way to<br/>use the Dictionary.  The current zip file is pretty much<br/>the latest version, except perhaps for two or three definitions.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
