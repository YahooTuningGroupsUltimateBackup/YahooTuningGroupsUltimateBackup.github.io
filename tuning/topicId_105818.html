But the really silly thing is, despite only giving us 100 MB<br/>for files, they give us 100 *GB* each for the &quot;attachments&quot; and photos<br/>sections. This is bonkers and why they set it up like this is<br/>completely beyond me.</p><p>You know what photos are, but you may not be aware about attachments.<br/>You can find the attachments section of the group here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/attachments/folder/0/list?mode=list&order=time&start=1&count=20&dir=desc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/attachments/folder/0/list?mode=list&order=time&start=1&count=20&dir=desc</a></p><p>You can see that this is, effectively, a second files section, with a<br/>100 GB limit on it. However, it&apos;s much less neat than the files<br/>section:<br/>- The attachments section isn&apos;t organized into directories like the<br/>Files section; you can sort by author and that&apos;s it.<br/>- You can only upload attachments via email, by literally attaching<br/>the file to the email in the usual way. You can&apos;t upload it via the<br/>group interface.<br/>- If you want to upload an attachment, you have to write an email to<br/>list attaching it, which everyone will see.</p><p>So it&apos;s kind of messy, and not very organized. It&apos;s definitely not as<br/>clean as the files interface. And yet, here we have 100 GB of storage,<br/>hosted right in the group, which we aren&apos;t taking advantage of at<br/>all...</p><p>I was thinking it might be a good idea to take some of the largest<br/>files in the group, reupload them as attachments, and then just put a<br/>link to the aforementioned attachments in the folder where they used<br/>to exist. For instance, you have like 4 PDF&apos;s in your folder totaling<br/>about 10 MB of space; you can just upload all of them as attachments<br/>to a single email and put a link to it in your files folder, and now<br/>things are still decently neat and we have 10% space remaining. You<br/>can get to the attachments using the files interface and all of its<br/>directories, and nobody need bother with the &quot;Attachments&quot; section<br/>directly.</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2013 12:29:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thoughts?</p><p>I noticed they started supporting attachments a while back,<br/>but hadn&apos;t noticed the archive section there or its 100GB limit.<br/>I agree that it leaves a lot to be desired as a files section<br/>replacement.</p><p>I don&apos;t see much difference between moving stuff from Files<br/>to Attachments now or later.

Why not just<br/>&gt; declare Files sealed and switch to Attachments straight away?</p><p>I think it&apos;s best to declare it sealed only for large files, like<br/>those 1 MB or more. If anyone accidentally uploads something too large<br/>to the Files section, I&apos;ll be notified and just resubmit it as an<br/>attachment for them.</p><p>This is partly because the Attachments section is an enormous pain in<br/>the ass: people who exclusively use the Yahoo interface are going to<br/>have a hell of a time with it, especially people whose current emails<br/>don&apos;t coincide with the one on the site (like Gene, I think). So<br/>there&apos;s no need to force people to jump through all those hoops if<br/>they just want to upload a &lt;1 KB scala file, for instance.</p><p>It&apos;s also because, now that we have 15 MB of free space left, the<br/>files section is still pretty useful so long as people only upload<br/>reasonably-sized files. It keeps things organized, and most files are<br/>small and don&apos;t cause problems; the average file in my folder is like<br/>~15 KB, for instance. So if people want to keep organizing their work<br/>in folders and are only putting small files up, it doesn&apos;t really make<br/>any difference. We have room for a thousand 15 KB files right now.</p><p>Lastly, it was driving me nuts that only one of your PDFs was an<br/>attachment and the rest weren&apos;t, so I deleted your test attachment<br/>post and submitted all four PDFs in one attachment here:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/attachments/folder/29635417/item/list">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/attachments/folder/29635417/item/list</a></p><p>I saw your reply about not breaking links in the other thread, so I<br/>didn&apos;t delete the original three PDFs. But, I noticed something<br/>interesting, which is that although I deleted your post with just the<br/>one PDF, the attachment still remains:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/attachments/folder/404685217/item/list">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/attachments/folder/404685217/item/list</a></p><p>So that&apos;s nice. You can upload an attachment to a post, and then<br/>delete your post to avoid spamming the list, and the attachment will<br/>remain.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Cuthbert Lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2013 3:06:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike, you can go ahead and erase whatever I&apos;ve got under either Cameron Bobro or lobawad- the Xenwiki and Soundcloud take care of everything.</p><p>________________________________<br/> From: battaglia01 &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2013 2:41 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Tuning List Files section is getting full</p><p>Hi all,</p><p>The files section is 98% full.
