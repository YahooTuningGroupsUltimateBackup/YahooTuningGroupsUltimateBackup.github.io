Would you mind giving the notes for the last few chords?</p><p>&gt;From: &quot;Gerald Eskelin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stg3music@earthlink.net">stg3music@earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The significance of the moving pitch is still of interest, however, since<br/>&gt;the tuning of the G may very well have been influenced by the combination of<br/>&gt;the sounding Eb and Bb. To me, the shift is not tiny, however.</p><p>I&apos;ve listened to the end of &quot;Blue &apos;n&apos; Green&quot; on my copy of &quot;From All<br/>Sides&quot;. My impression is that the soloist&apos;s G goes up just a little bit as<br/>the other singers go through a sequence of chords before resting on the<br/>final Abmaj9 (Jerry, might you post what those chords are?). My guess is<br/>that her original G is 5/4 relative to Eb, and her final G is just a hair<br/>above that, much closer to 5/4 than to 400 cents. Whether or not I am right<br/>about her pitches reletive to 5/4 or 400 cents, I perceive the change as<br/>one that may be explained as a very small performance variation, or as one<br/>that allows the soloist to be heard as distinct from the background (heard<br/>by herself, as well as by the audience). To my ears she is _slightly out of<br/>tune at the higher pitch. I&apos;m sure the chord would lock better if she were<br/>to finish on her original pitch. But since she&apos;s the soloist I&apos;m not so<br/>sure that that would be an improvement in the performance. To me it&apos;s just<br/>like what was posted (by Johnny Reinhard?) about the solo violinist playing<br/>sharper than the other strings in a concerto.</p><p>John Link</p><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>The CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET is now available!<br/>To purchase the CD visit <a href="http://www.johnlinkmusic.com">www.johnlinkmusic.com</a>, or write to <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a>.<br/>________________________________________________________________________________</p></div><h3><a id=8924 href="#8924">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I&apos;d<br/>&gt; estimate the final G at around 395 cents above the Eb -- more calm than an<br/>&gt; ET major third, but high enough to avoid &quot;disappearing&quot; into the chord.</p><p>Thanks to Christopher Chapman&apos;s help a few weeks ago, I learned how to tune<br/>my M-1. So, prodded by John&apos;s and Paul&apos;s interest here, I compared Vicky&apos;s<br/>G(s?) to the M-1. I selected scale type &quot;Pure&quot; (evidently JI, from the sound<br/>of it), master tuned it to Eb, adjusted it a few cents to fit Vicky&apos;s high<br/>Eb and the low Eb in the final sonority. Then I played the excerpt about<br/>twenty times and noticed a whole bunch of stuff.</p><p>The big surprise was that she _initially_ sings the final G way above the JI<br/>third. So I switched to ET and she was even higher than a tempered G. When<br/>she moves it up as the final chord arrives she moves even higher.</p><p>No other way to describe it. She is simply &quot;way sharp&quot; on her last pitch.<br/>When I sang her last pitch with her and sustained it past the recording with<br/>a low Eb sounding on the keyboard, it was really &quot;unpleasant.&quot; She is closer<br/>to Ab than to the ET G. (Does that remind you of our 7:9 discussion?)<br/>Evidently, since it doesn&apos;t sound nearly as dissonant on the recording, much<br/>of the sharpness appears to be masked by the combination of pitches in the<br/>sung chord.</p><p>I certainly agree with John that the chord would lock better if she had held<br/>her original pitch; but of course that would already be close to what I have<br/>been calling the &quot;high third.&quot;</p><p>On the other hand, there is the possibility that she _did sustain the last G<br/>without pitch change and we are only &quot;hearing&quot; it change. (Note my &quot;hold the<br/>press&quot; reactions to Dan Wolf&apos;s new sound demos.) Notice that the G seems to<br/>change precisely when the final chord arrives. Does she change it because<br/>she anticipates the sound of the final chord? Or is it an illusion? Is it<br/>Memorex? Or is it the real thing?</p><p>Regarding sharping to stand out from the crowd: I&apos;m not sure about that. I<br/>know that would not be something Vicky would do intentionally. If that were<br/>the case, she would have been sharp through the whole thing--which she<br/>clearly is not. I&apos;ll have to pay attention for a while to concerto soloists.<br/>(Of course, we won&apos;t know, will we, if the effect is illusionary<br/>--particularly on final tonic chords.)</p><p>That&apos;s enough. I think I&apos;ll go pour a martini.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
