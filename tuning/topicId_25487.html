About half the people who<br/>offered feedback found an objectionable variation in melodic steps, and<br/>I decided to add a mechanism that would tend to keep such variations in<br/>check.  I have just posted the first results for the same sequence.</p><p>Also, as requested by Robert Walker, there is a version with melodic<br/>steps accentuated rather than reduced in unevenness.  I think it&apos;s<br/>pretty hot!  Certainly wacky...</p><p>This is Chopin&apos;s &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot;, Op. 66, sequenced by Larry<br/>Ellis, in General MIDI format.
