An introduction into this subject requires<br/>three initial steps.</p><p>(1)  Consider the following equation for calculating the tension of a<br/>string:</p><p>T = 4 * F^2 * L^2 * Pi * r^2 * rho</p><p>where F is the frequency, in Hz;  L is the vibrating length of the<br/>string, in meters;  r is the radius of the string, in meters;  and rho is<br/>the mass density of the stringing material, in kg/m^3.</p><p>This equation includes the following subequation:</p><p>M/u.l. = Pi * r^2 * rho</p><p>where M/u.l. is the mass per unit length of the string.</p><p>For a quality piano, typical properties for middle G, or the G above<br/>middle C, are</p><p>F = 392.0 Hz<br/>L = .489 meter  (19.25 in.)<br/>r = .000483 meter  (.019 in.)<br/>rho = 7833 kg/m^3 for spring steel [ .00073299 (lbf * s^2)/in^4 ]</p><p>so that,</p><p>M/u.l. = 3.1416 * .000483^2 * 7833 = .00574 kg/m</p><p>and,</p><p>T = 4 * 392.0^2 *.489^2 * 3.1416 * .000483^2 * 7833</p><p>T = 843.8 Newtons  (189.3 pounds-force)</p><p>(2)  To calculate a string&apos;s break strength, we must know the<br/>tensile strength of the stringing material.  For spring steel, tensile<br/>strength values range between 300,000 psi -- 400,000 psi, or<br/>between 2.07 * 10^9 Pa -- 2.76 * 10^9 Pa. (Pa short for Pascals.)<br/>An average value of 350,000 psi is equivalent to 2.41 * 10^9 Pa.</p><p>First, calculate the string&apos;s cross-sectional surface area:</p><p>S = Pi * r^2 = 3.1416 * .000483^2 = 7.329 * 10^-7 sq. m</p><p>Now calculate the string&apos;s break strength by multiplying the<br/>surface area times the average tensile strength of spring steel:</p><p>Break Strength = (7.329 * 10^-7) * (2.41 * 10^9) = 1766.3 N</p><p>Finally, determine what percentage 843.8 N is of 1766.3 N.  Divide<br/>the smaller number by the larger, and multiply the quotient by 100:</p><p>(843.8 / 1766.3) * 100 = 48</p><p>Since most piano strings are tensioned between 40% and 50% of<br/>their break strength, 48% is within the desired range.</p><p>(3)  Finally, we must evaluate the inharmonicity of this string.</p><p>The quote below is from my manuscript _Musical Mathematics: A<br/>Practice in the Mathematics of Tuning Instruments and Analyzing<br/>Scales_.</p><p>To read the Table of Contents of this work, please logon at:</p><p><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/musical_mathematics.htm">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/musical_mathematics.htm</a></p><p>Here is an excerpt from the beginning of Chapter 4:</p><p>******************************</p><p>&quot;On any given string, a true harmonic series could only occur if the<br/>string were perfectly flexible.  Since all strings exhibit varying<br/>degrees of _stiffness_, the flexible string model no longer applies.<br/>Stiffness causes the modes to vibrate at frequencies considerably<br/>higher than suggested by Equation 4.1.  For this reason, we call<br/>the sharp mode frequencies of stiff strings inharmonic frequencies<br/>[ IF(n) ], a term that refers to non-integer multiples of the<br/>fundamental frequency.&quot;</p><p>******************************</p><p>To calculate the IF(n) requires a dimensionless stiffness<br/>parameter ( J ).  There are two different types of equations for J:<br/>one includes a tension ( T ) variable;  the other includes a<br/>frequency variable ( F ).  In the former equation, J is directly<br/>proportional to D^4, where D is the diameter of the string.  In the<br/>latter equation, J is directly proportional to D^2.  Therefore, as the<br/>diameter or the thickness of the string increases, the stiffness<br/>parameter increases as well.  This tells us that for thin strings the<br/>upper modes of vibration are more in tune than for thick strings.<br/>For the above-calculated G-392.0 Hz string, J = .0002088.  If we<br/>substitute this value into an equation for IF(n), and if we then<br/>calculate the inharmonic frequency of the second mode of<br/>vibration, the result is IF(2) = 784.49 cps.  In a perfectly flexible<br/>string, F(2) = 784.00 cps.  Consequently, the second mode<br/>sounds 1.083 cents sharp.  Similarly, the third mode sounds 2.888<br/>cents sharp, and the fourth mode sounds 5.415 cents sharp.</p><p>(( _Musical Mathematics_ contains detailed equations for<br/>calculating J and IF(n).

Since the tones of these scales (with the<br/>exception of the &quot;octave&quot;) are tuned to irrational frequency ratios,<br/>and since in stiff strings the upper modes of vibration sound<br/>irrational frequencies, there exists no instantly recognizable<br/>conflict.</p><p>However, when conventionally strung pianos are tuned in just<br/>intonation, where all the tones are tuned to rational frequency<br/>ratios, intonational problems instantly become audible.</p><p>To read a description of my Just Keys piano, which I restrung<br/>three times and retuned four times in 1990, please logon at:</p><p><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/instruments.htm">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/instruments.htm</a> &gt; Just Keys</p><p>In pianos, the bass and treble bridges are glued to the<br/>soundboard.  Since they are not moveable, one has no choice in<br/>determining the vibrating lengths of piano strings.  Therefore, once<br/>a scale has been decided, the diameters of strings constitute the<br/>most critical physical variables in restringing pianos.</p><p>To summarize:</p><p>(1) Tension is directly proportional to r^2.  (2) Break Strength is<br/>directly proportional to r^2.  (3) J is either directly proportional to<br/>D^4, or to D^2.</p><p>The science of restringing and the art of retuning pianos are<br/>critically determined by either the radii or the diameters of strings.</p><p>OK.  Now, let&apos;s open the lid of this B&ouml;sendorfer Imperial,<br/>take out all the strings, and get it right the first time!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>I-am-an-instrument-in-need-of-tuning</p><p>AKA</p><p>Cris Forster, Music Director<br/><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p></div>
