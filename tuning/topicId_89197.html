In either<br/>reading, this would be the same as the medieval<br/>Maqam &grave;Iraq, which the Lebanese composer and scholar<br/>Nidaa Abou Mrad  gives in one likely interpretation as<br/>follows, based on al-Farabi&apos;s neutral second steps<br/>of 12:11 and 88:81.</p><p>           &grave;Iraq           tone       &grave;Iraq<br/>   |---------------------|      |------------------|<br/>  1/1   12/11    27/22  4/3    3/2  18/11  81/44  2/1<br/>   0     151      355   498    702   853   1057  1200<br/>    12:11    9:8    88:81   9:8  12:11  9:8  88:81<br/>     151     204     143    204   151   204   143</p><p>Note that this form of medieval &grave;Iraq or Mohajira has<br/>three sizes of intervals: a tone (here 9:8), a larger<br/>neutral second at 12:11, and a smaller one at 81:44.<br/>The two neutral seconds add up to a regular minor third,<br/>which in this context where Pythagorean tuning is assumed<br/>is 32:27 or 294 cents. I should clarify that in this<br/>just system based on ratios of 2-3-11, the Pythagorean<br/>chain of fifth does _not_ generate the neutral intervals,<br/>which are introduced as independent factors.</p><p>In a medieval context, Mrad and I agree that the relevant<br/>source appears to indicate that the larger neutral second<br/>step comes first in a tetrachord. In a modern context,<br/>however, &grave;Iraq is a general term for a tetrachord on this<br/>pattern of J T J. The generic system of modern Arab theory<br/>often expresses this in terms of a 24-step system as 3 4 3,<br/>not necessarily implying equal steps but simply identifying<br/>the types of intervals as a tone &quot;4&quot; and neutral second &quot;3&quot;.<br/>Using the 53-comma system often favored in Turkey and Syria,<br/>we could write 7 9 6 or 6 9 7 to indicate whether a larger<br/>or smaller neutral second step comes first -- or in Ozan<br/>Yarman&apos;s 79MOS-of-159 notation, 10 14 9 or 9 14 10.</p><p>To understand Jacky Ligon&apos;s ingenious superparticular scale,<br/>we must consider a related form discussed by Erv Wilson<br/>in his _Rast-Bayyati Matrix_ paper. Suppose we generate<br/>a tuning by chaining two _unequal_ neutral thirds, the<br/>sizes above of 12:11 and 27:22 given by al-Farabi as an<br/>interpretation of Mansur Zalzal&apos;s famous neutral third<br/>fretting for the &grave;oud or lute in the 8th century. We get<br/>this tuning, starting from the 1/1 of the chain:</p><p>           &quot;Zalzalian Penchgah&quot;              Rast<br/>   |--------------------------------|--------------------|<br/>  1/1     9/8   27/22    243/176   3/2   27/16   81/44  2/1<br/>   0      204    355       558     702    906    1057  1200<br/>     9:8     12:11    9:8     88:81   9:8    12:11  88:81<br/>     204      151     204      143    204    151     143</p><p>Here the pattern we get is T J T J - T J J, which borrowing<br/>a Turkish usage might be called a Zalzalian Maqam Penchgah,<br/>with a lower pentachord alternating tones and neutral seconds,<br/>and an upper Rast tetrachord with a tone followed by a larger<br/>12:11 and smaller 88:81 neutral second. Note, again, that<br/>there are _three_ interval sizes, with 12:11 plus 88:81 equal<br/>to 32:27.</p><p>(Note that the modern Turkish Penchgah as reported by Ozan<br/>Yarman is different, with &quot;J&quot; equal to 10:9 or 16:15, as also<br/>happens in a common form of Turkish Rast, so that the maqam<br/>is taken as ~1/1-9/8-5/4-45/32-3/2-27/16-15/8-2/1, with a<br/>suggested nuancing of the 45/32 step to a nearby 7/5. For<br/>our present purposes, however, it is the neutral third<br/>version that is relevant in relation to Jacky&apos;s tuning.)</p><p>In Scala terms, this could also be called a tritriadic tuning<br/>of the 22:27:33 sonority: it&apos;s a JI scheme distinct from any<br/>tempered tuning using a single neutral third generator.</p><p>The key to Jacky&apos;s ingenious variation is that the comma or<br/>kleisma between al-Farabi&apos;s two neutral second steps at<br/>12:11 (151 cents) and 88:81 (143 cents), and likewise between<br/>his neutral thirds at 27:22 (355 cents) and 11:9 (347 cents),<br/>is rather small: 243/242 or 7.139 cents.</p><p>Thus, a natural given Jacky&apos;s love of superparticular JI steps<br/>and stretched or compressed octave tunings (the latter also<br/>arising with TOP temperaments, of course), he hit on his<br/>clever takeoff on al-Farabi, whether or not he conceived of<br/>it in those historical terms:</p><p>           &quot;Ligonian Penchgah&quot;         &quot;Ligonian Rast&quot;<br/>   |--------------------------------|-----------------------|<br/>  1/1     9/8   27/22    243/176 729/484 6561/3872 19683/ 59040/<br/>                                                   10648  29282<br/>   0      204    355       558     709      913     1064   1214<br/>     9:8     12:11    9:8     12:11    9:8     12:11   12:11<br/>     204      151     204      151     204      151     151</p><p>Here we have only _two_ step sizes, the 9:8 tone and 12:11 neutral<br/>second -- so that the fifth gets stretched by 7.139 cents, almost<br/>identical to 13/22 octave! -- and the octave by twice this amount.</p><p>While the concept here is JI, a curious aside would note that<br/>a 27/22 generator produces a tuning virtually identical to 44-EDO,<br/>which unlike 22-EDO has a complement of neutral intervals. While<br/>all neutral thirds will be precisely or virtually equal to 27/22,<br/>we will have two _unequal_ neutral seconds together adding up to<br/>a minor third of precisely 300 cents (11/44 octave), the larger<br/>at 164 cents or 6/44 octave (an interval found in 22-EDO), and<br/>the smaller at 136 cents or 5/44 octave.</p><p>In short, JI tunings and TOP temperaments or the like are distinct<br/>approaches, although they may sometimes yield curiously similar<br/>results. Anyway, when I look at Jacky&apos;s stretched octave tuning<br/>with its all-superparticular steps, I would think back to Zalzal<br/>and al-Farabi, with some influence from stretched octave styles<br/>such as gamelan a not unlikely factor.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2010 8:26:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo&gt;&quot;While all neutral thirds will be precisely or virtually equal to 27/22,<br/>we will have two _unequal_ neutral seconds together adding up to<br/>a minor third of precisely 300 cents (11/44 octave)&quot;</p><p>  This is where I think the ingenuity really hits...good smaller interval &quot;adding up&quot; to good mid and large sized ones that are pretty much uniform across the scale.  And while one or two off the fifth-ish interval are off (around 1.4444 or 13/9)...they aren&apos;t &quot;wolf&quot; by any means and most of the other intervals sound incredibly confident and expressive.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The key to Jacky&apos;s ingenious variation is that the comma or<br/>kleisma between al-Farabi&apos;s two neutral second steps at<br/>12:11 (151 cents) and 88:81 (143 cents), and likewise between<br/>his neutral thirds at 27:22 (355 cents) and 11:9 (347 cents),<br/>is rather small: 243/242 or 7.139 cents.&quot;<br/>  Right so, as I understand it, he manages to reap both a lot of the purity of a JI scale while keeping a lot of the constant interval size-like nature of TET scales.</p><p>  To my ears, Jacky&apos;s scale there is a bit more useful than Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scale...which in turn I believe is a fair bit more useful to Pythagorus&apos; scale.<br/>In both Jacky and Ptolemy&apos;s scale I find the neutral seconds and new 7th interval&apos;s ability to make tons of new chords well worth the loss of a mere two perfect fifths...and in fact a wider variety of total chords possible (or so I&apos;ve found by composing with them).</p><p>  If you&apos;re not obsessed with getting near-perfect standard (IE using near-perfect 5ths) triads almost everywhere I highly recommend both Ptolemy&apos;s and Jacky&apos;s scales.<br/>  And Margo I agree, Jacky&apos;s scale is an original and not any sort of deliberate Arab scale knock-off or &quot;tweak&quot;.  It&apos;s a shame that when a few characteristics of a scale are similar to a historical one people say &quot;all you&apos;re doing a slight variation of the &apos;real&apos; historic version of the scale&quot;...which IMVHO may explain why so few people seem to be bothering with creating new scales that don&apos;t deliberately model themselves off older ones.  Needless to say, I highly respect those who even at least try to make new scales and again say I think Jacky&apos;s skill with scales has a profound effect on adding a great deal of originality on top of his/?her? already superb composition skills.</p><p>  Again I ask though...is that scale his only major invented/new scale?

Thus<br/>you are emulating his concept, rather than<br/>vice versa -- and in a very interesting way!</p><p>First of all, I see the use of the term<br/>&quot;Mohajira&quot; for a neutral third generator,<br/>as opposed to a kind of Near Eastern tetrachord<br/>or maqam, as an idiom specific to a group of<br/>people, of whom you are a very noteworthy member,<br/>exploring these &quot;regular mappings.&quot; I might speak<br/>simply of a &quot;hemififth&quot; generator or the like.</p><p>Secondly, terminology quite aside, let&apos;s consider<br/>what happens if we build a tuning based on a<br/>regular generator of 27/22, repeating it, say,<br/>to form a 7-note tuning. We won&apos;t get either<br/>of Jacky&apos;s steps, 9:8 or 12:11, but rather<br/>steps of around 218 and 136 cents, or rather<br/>to close to 17:15 and 13:12, for example.</p><p>Yes, you can then stretch the octave by two<br/>243:242 commas, take that as the periodicity,<br/>and arrive at Jacky&apos;s result. But would you<br/>normally do so under your paradigm, even a<br/>TOP version? Looking at Paul Erlich&apos;s article<br/>on &quot;A Middle Path&quot; (_Xenharmonikon_ 18), I<br/>see that TOP adjustments are generally rather<br/>smaller than 14 cents.

But I<br/>couldn&apos;t find them in usage neither in Arabic nor in Persian music<br/>then. The closest I could find was with the Persian Dastgah-e Seg&acirc;h,<br/>where the seventh degree was quite lower, and listening even more<br/>closely to several records lately I still think Dastgah Segah follows<br/>a much more complex model.<br/>But perhaps I missed it in Arabic music, did you mentionned &quot;Irak&quot; to<br/>have the same tetrachordal structure ?<br/>(then this would be a beautiful co&iuml;ncidence because my piece &quot;Sumer&quot;,<br/>started in 1991, that uses intensively the heptatonic form of<br/>Mohajira, was inspired by visions I received during the first Gulf<br/>war...)<br/>Then I tried to look for more ancient sources and I asked John<br/>Chalmers, among others, about it.<br/>John pointed to me a tetrachord (#458) from Ibn Sina :<br/>1/1  13/12  39/32  4/3<br/>(13/12 - 9/8 - 128/117)<br/>= the &quot;s L s&quot;  tetrachord I was looking for ! (the only one that can<br/>generate the heptatonic form of Mohajira).<br/>But still I had no name for it and Mohajira (= &quot;migratory&quot; in<br/>Arabian) was clearly what the heptatonic versions expressed for me,<br/>so this is how I described it,  close to the Persian &quot;Segah&quot;, of the<br/>form  [s L s L s L s] and generated by a succession of six WustaZalzal.<br/>Years later when I joined the Tuning list I found that people were<br/>using that name and thought it was traditional...  I thought it was<br/>funny, but I had to rectify, because Mohajira was only my own naming.<br/>Anyway, neither Graham nor others are responsible of this, and if I<br/>can have the possiblity myself to hear what I mean by a Mohajira<br/>heptaphone in a Maqam where it has a traditional name, first I will<br/>be glad to hear it and then I would not use the name &quot;Mohajira&quot; again<br/>for such heptatonic scales. So may be you, Ozan, or others can help<br/>(I think you mentionned &quot;Mustaqim&quot; for this same Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>tetrachord lately ? and would &quot;Irak&quot; be the same ?).<br/>Also, you mentionned an article you wrote on the subject, but I<br/>haven&apos;t read it. Can we find it somewhere ?</p><p>Now, as I said not long ago, &quot;Mohajira&quot; means many things for me, not<br/>to forget a generator of the half of a meantone fifth, or of the<br/>triple of a Secor, and certainly that the notion of  &quot;a linear<br/>temperament that leads to 24 &gt; 31 &gt; 55 tones per octave mapped &lt;0, 2,<br/>8, -11, 5, -1, -10, -6], of which one interesting generator is<br/>1.2232849566  or 348.91261178844 c., the solution of the recurrent<br/>sequence x^5 - x^4 = 1/2&quot;...  should not interfere too much with any<br/>traditional knowledge at least !<br/>- - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>Margo wrote :</p><p>&gt; Graham wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right, so how is it different?

It is often<br/>the nature of musical terms, of course, to be take on<br/>a range of meanings, so my purpose is simply to thank<br/>you for a most illuminating explanation and to clarify<br/>a few points to my best knowledge. To answer some of<br/>the questions you raise, we need to turn to the<br/>relevant text of Ibn Sina, or to a reliable translation,<br/>with d&apos;Erlanger as one candidate.</p><p>My point of uncertainty, not having such a translation<br/>at hand, is whether Ibn Sina himself discussed the<br/>specific permutation 13:12-9:8-128:117, or someone<br/>else derived this from his Mustaqim, which I have read<br/>is 9:8-13:12-128:117. John Chalmers quotes the first<br/>form, and I am not sure if Ibn Sina himself states this<br/>permutation or if Chalmers or someone else derives it<br/>from what Ibn Sina terms Mustaqim, perhaps following<br/>the custom of tending to put the smallest interval of a<br/>tetrachord first, for example.</p><p>Indeed I agree that if we take Segah Dastgah from the<br/>step now considered a neutral third below the usual final,<br/>but sometimes taken as the 1/1 in reckoning the intervals<br/>of this dastgah (e.g. segah2.scl in the Scala archives),<br/>we have Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim!</p><p>             Mustaqim           Mustaqim        tone<br/>        |------------------|-------------------|      |<br/>       1/1   9/8  39/32   4/3    3/2   13/8  16/9    2/1<br/>        0    204   342    498    702    841   996   1200<br/>          9:8  13:12 128:117  9:8  13:12 128:117 9:8<br/>Farhat: 0    200   335    495    700    835   995   1200<br/>segah2: 0    200   340    500    700    840  1000   1200</p><p>Now let us compare this to Zalzal&apos;s tuning as described<br/>somewhat earlier by al-Farabi, a form which might now be<br/>called a conjunct Maqam Rast:</p><p>                 Rast              Rast          tone<br/>        |------------------|-------------------|       |<br/>       1/1   9/8  27/22   4/3    3/2   18/11  16/9    2/1<br/>        0    204   355    498    702    853   996   1200<br/>          9:8  12:11 88:81   9:8   12:11   88:81  9:8</p><p>It is curious that Ibn Sina is the first to use the term<br/>Mustaqim (Arabic for the &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; form)<br/>for a tetrachord with lower tone and two neutral seconds,<br/>while Arab usage applies the equivalent Persian term Rast!</p><p>As you observe, Ibn Sina&apos;s steps of 13:12 and 128:117 differ<br/>more decidedly at 139 and 155 cents than al-Farabi&apos;s 12:11<br/>and 88:81 at 151 and 143 cents. The other distinction is<br/>that in al-Farabi&apos;s tuning of a type later called Rast,<br/>the larger neutral second step is placed before the smaller<br/>(151-143), while the converse applies in Mustaqim (139-155).</p><p>Another aspect of this latter distinction is that even<br/>today, a larger neutral third above the final is<br/>characteristic of Arab Rast, and a smaller neutral third<br/>of Persian modal systems such as Afshari (often F-Ap), or<br/>indeed some gusheh-ha of Mahur where the final of C may<br/>have an inflected Ep above it.</p><p>From the viewpoint of permutations, it then would be natural<br/>to associate Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim with a tetrachord like<br/>1/1-13/12-39/32-4/3 in Chalmers, or 13:12-9:8-128:117, where<br/>again we have the smaller neutral second placed first. However,<br/>if we derive a tetrachord of the J-T-J type (&quot;J&quot; here meaning<br/>a neutral second) by rotation, then the larger 128:117 actually<br/>comes first, as may be seen by looking at the tetrachord above<br/>the third step, typically the final of a modern Segah Dastgah:</p><p>       1/1   9/8  39/32   4/3    3/2   13/8  16/9    2/1<br/>        0    204   342    498    702    841   996   1200<br/>                    |--------------------|<br/>                   1/1  128/117 16/13   4/3<br/>                    0     155    359    498<br/>                    128:117  9:8    13:12<br/>                      155    204     139<br/>segah2.scl            160    200     140<br/>Farhat                160    205     135</p><p>The same kind of thing happens with al-Farabi&apos;s tuning<br/>later called Rast. It would be natural, thinking in terms<br/>of permutation, to associate 9:8-12:11-88:81 with a<br/>tetrachord with 9:8 as the central step where the larger<br/>12:11 precedes the smaller 88:81, thus 1/1-12/11-27/22-4/3<br/>(0-151-355-498 cents or 151-204-143 cents).</p><p>Indeed, in the later 13th century, roughly three centuries<br/>after al-Farabi and some two after Ibn Sina, Safi al-Din<br/>al-Urmawi describes a tetrachord &grave;Iraq in which we have<br/>J T J, and a mode &grave;Iraq with two such tetrachords. However,<br/>there are some questions of interpretation. Taken literally<br/>as transcribed by Dr. Fazli Arslan, we have two _conjunct_<br/>tetrachords of a 5-based structure 1/1-10/9-5/4-4/3, with<br/>&quot;J&quot; representing 10:9 or 16:15 rather than a neutral second<br/>step of the kind used by al-Farabi or Ibn Sina. Here I ignore<br/>the 1.95-cent schisma (32805:32768) in Safi al-Din&apos;s 17-note<br/>Pythagorean scheme used for some of his tunings:</p><p>           &grave;Iraq               &grave;Iraq          tone<br/>    |------------------|-------------------|<br/>   1/1   10/9   5/4   4/3    40/27   5/3  16/9    2/1<br/>    0     182   386   498     680    884  996   1200<br/>     10:9   9:8   16:15  10:9    9:8  16:15  9:8</p><p>The Lebanese scholar Nidaa Abou Mrad offers a very<br/>appealing Zalzalian tuning, taking two &grave;Iraq tetrachords<br/>based on a permutation of al-Farabi&apos;s tuning,<br/>i.e. 12:11-9:8-88:81, and deeming these to genres to<br/>be &quot;separated by a whole step,&quot; i.e. disjunct, or<br/>J T J - T - J T J, the basic form of your Mohajira:</p><p>           &grave;Iraq         tone         &grave;Iraq<br/>    |------------------|      |---------------------|<br/>   1/1   12/11  27/22 4/3    3/2   18/11  81/44    2/1<br/>    0     151   355   498    702    853   1057   1200<br/>     12:11   9:8  88:81   9:8   12:11  9:8   88:81<br/>      151    204   143    204    151   204    143</p><p>If we adopt this reading of the tetrachord but a<br/>conjunct arrangement of the kind often favored by<br/>medieval Islamic sources -- as in al-Farabi&apos;s tuning<br/>later called Rast, or Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim -- then we<br/>get:</p><p>           &grave;Iraq               &grave;Iraq          tone<br/>    |------------------|--------------------|      |<br/>   1/1   12/11  27/22 4/3   16/11  18/11  16/9    2/1<br/>    0     151   355   498    649    853    996   1200<br/>     12:11   9:8  88:81  12:11  9:8   88:81   9:8<br/>      151    204   143    151   204    143    204</p><p>It is interesting that in modern Arab theory, an<br/>&grave;Iraq tetrachord means the generic arrangement &quot;3 4 3&quot;<br/>in the 24-step notation. However, a caution is<br/>necessary: while this continues to be a theoretical<br/>construct, the musically most salient concept focuses<br/>on the lower trichord of &quot;3 4&quot; known as Sikah, and<br/>common to the Sikah family of maqamat (the same term<br/>as Persian Segah, i.e. the &quot;third&quot; step).</p><p>Looking at the modern Sikah family sharing the theme<br/>of the trichord derived by rotation, i.e. by starting<br/>on the third step of Rast, we find that in fact it is<br/>the _smaller_ neutral second that precedes the larger,<br/>more as in a permutation of Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim, although<br/>with varying degrees of contrast between the two neutral<br/>steps depending on local intonation practices in different<br/>parts of the Arab world. Let us first consider al-Farabi&apos;s<br/>tuning:</p><p>                 Rast              Rast          tone<br/>        |------------------|-------------------|       |<br/>       1/1   9/8  27/22   4/3    3/2   18/11  16/9    2/1<br/>        0    204   355    498    702    853   996   1200<br/>          9:8  12:11 88:81   9:8   12:11   88:81  9:8<br/>                            &grave;Iraq<br/>                    |--------------------|<br/>                   1/1    88/81  11/9   4/3<br/>                    0      143   347    498<br/>                      88:81   9:8  12:11<br/>                       143    204   151</p><p>Here the smaller neutral third and tone make up a Sikah<br/>trichord, with the larger neutral third completing the<br/>theoretical tetrachord of &grave;Iraq, which may indeed be<br/>found in modern Maqam &grave;Iraq. However, the usual modern<br/>interpretation of this Maqam divides the genera or ajnas<br/>(Arabic plural of jins or &quot;genus&quot;) otherwise:</p><p>         Sikah               Bayyati           Rast<br/>    |--------------|-----------------------|------------|<br/>   1/1   88/81   11/9    4/3   352/243   44/27  11/6   2/1<br/>    0     143    347     498     642      845   1049  1200<br/>     88:81   9:8    12:11   88:81    9:8     9:8   12:11<br/>    |---------------------|<br/>           &grave;Iraq</p><p>In a usual account, we have a Sikah trichord, Bayyati<br/>tetrachord, and Rast trichord. However, the &grave;Iraq tetrachord<br/>is certainly recognized in current theory, and is there<br/>if we wish to celebrate it and explore it, following the<br/>adage: &quot;Follow the ajnas.&quot; If we do so, then raising the<br/>fifth step of Maqam &grave;Iraq to a 3/2 would produce a disjunct<br/>Mohajira. And in a more &quot;contrasty&quot; tuning of Maqam &grave;Iraq,<br/>we would get a shade of intonation more like the Chalmers<br/>permutation of Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim (whatever its original<br/>source), as in my regular temperament at 704.607 cents:</p><p>         Sikah               Bayyati           Rast<br/>    |--------------|-----------------------|------------|<br/>    0    132      341     495     628     837   1046  1200<br/>      132    209      154    132      209    209   154<br/>    |---------------------|<br/>           &grave;Iraq</p><p>and by raising the fifth degree:</p><p>         Sikah           Mrad&apos;s &grave;Iraq           Rast<br/>    |--------------|-----------------------|------------|<br/>    0    132      341     495      705    837   1046  1200<br/>      132    209      154     209      132   209   154<br/>    |---------------------|         |-------------------|<br/>           &grave;Iraq             tone            &grave;Iraq</p><p>Here the Maqam I suspect we may both be delighted to call<br/>Mohajira with its disjunct &grave;Iraq (or Mohajira) tetrachords<br/>is shown below the degrees and adjacent steps in cents, while a trichord-tetrachord-trichord division fitting<br/>the modern pattern of a lower Sikah and upper Rast is<br/>shown above. Because the name &quot;Maqam &grave;Iraq&quot; is now so<br/>widely understood to mean the previous form with a<br/>middle Bayyati tetrachord, Maqam Mohajira seems to<br/>a fitting name, with an explanation that this may be<br/>synonymous with a 13th-century interpretation of<br/>Maqam &grave;Iraq as suggested by Mrad. A neat feature of<br/>our Maqam Mohajira is that it includes in the<br/>trichord-tetrachord-trichord interpretation a middle<br/>tetrachord like that of Mrad, with with smaller neutral<br/>second, tone, and larger neutral second (here 154-209-132)!</p><p>Apart from Mrad&apos;s medieval Maqam &grave;Iraq, is there any strong<br/>precedent for our &grave;Iraq or Mohajira tetrachord as a focal<br/>unit? Curiously, an example that stands out to me is an<br/>intonation of Dastgah-e Bayat-e Esfahan sometimes known as<br/>the &quot;Old Esfahan,&quot; with small neutral second, 9:8 tone, and<br/>large neutral second leading up to the final. As I tune<br/>this interpretation:</p><p>             |--------------------|<br/>             F#     G*     A*     B<br/>             0     132    341    495<br/>               132     209   154</p><p>Indeed I would be very comfortable calling this Mohajira,<br/>by contrast with the Buzurg which would result if I<br/>should raise A* by a comma to Bb at 363 cents.</p><p>Of course, seeing exactly what Ibn Sina himself said<br/>about Mustaqim and any of its permutations he may have<br/>mentioned would permit a more informed discussion on<br/>the question of the earliest mention of our Mohajira;<br/>in my view, Safi al-Din&apos;s &grave;Iraq tetrachord of J T J<br/>qualifies the moment anyone reads this in a Zalzalian<br/>intonation, as Mrad suggests likely happened at the<br/>time or soon after. Would John Chalmers, Ozan, or<br/>anyone here have convenient access to Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>text or a translation?</p><p>And whether or not Ibn Sina himself mentioned this<br/>permutation of his Mustaqim or not, associating<br/>permutations of a given tetrachord with the person<br/>describing or advocating that tetrachord is a very<br/>common practice, so your beautiful narrative can<br/>stand, Jacques, regardless of this detail.</p><p>If you asked me for a definition of Mohajira, I might<br/>propose the following:</p><p>    The term Mohajira, literally &quot;migratory,&quot; can refer<br/>    to either a type of tetrachord or mode; or to a method<br/>    of scale generation chaining either a single neutral<br/>    third or two unequal neutral thirds, with a 7-note<br/>    chain producing a Mohajira mode. The term was<br/>    originated by Jacques Dudon.</p><p>    1. A tetrachord with neutral second, tone around 9:8,<br/>       and neutral second, sometimes specifically applied<br/>       to a shade of intonation like 1/1-13/12-39/32-4/3<br/>       (0-139-342-498 cents), a permutation of Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>       Mustaqim at 1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3, where the two<br/>       neutral second steps differ considerably in size<br/>       and the smaller precedes the larger. From Jacques<br/>       Dudon, who explored a modality with two disjunct<br/>       tetrachords of this type in a piece called &quot;Sumer&quot;<br/>       inspired by visions received during the first<br/>       U.S.-Iraq Gulf War of 1991, and then was informed<br/>       by John Chalmers of Ibn Sina&apos;s tetrachord (whether<br/>       presented as 13:12-9:8-128:117 by Ibna Sina himself<br/>       or derived later as a permutation of Mustaqim).</p><p>       As Dudon has remarked, it is thus notable that a<br/>       tetrachord of this general type is known in modern<br/>       Arab theory as &grave;Iraq, and makes up the lowest four<br/>       notes above the final of modern Maqam &grave;Iraq. The<br/>       Lebanese scholar Nidaa Abou Mrad has deduced a<br/>       likely medieval interpretation of Safi al-Din&apos;s<br/>       tetrachord and octave species of &grave;Iraq which would<br/>       result in a maqam like Dudon&apos;s with two disjunct<br/>       tetrachords each with neutral second, tone, neutral<br/>       second, the larger neutral step here being placed<br/>       first.</p><p>    2. A method of scale generation based on chaining<br/>       either a single neutral third generator often<br/>       at precisely half the size of a fifth at or<br/>       relatively close to 3/2; or two such generators<br/>       typically adding up to such a fifth. The first<br/>       method is often applied to tunings such as<br/>       17-EDO, 24-EDO, 31-EDO, or 44-EDO where the usual<br/>       fifth is divisible into two equal neutral thirds;<br/>       while Erv Wilson and others have used the second<br/>       to generate a variety of just or tempered scales<br/>       of a tritriadic variety (e.g. 22:27:33 by chaining<br/>       al-Farabi&apos;s neutral thirds at 27:22 and 11:9; or<br/>       32:39:48 from Ibn Sina&apos;s 39:32 and 16:13).</p><p>       A 7-note chain using the first method produces a<br/>       Moment of Symmetry (MOS) scale with only two<br/>       adjacent step sizes, while such a chain using the<br/>       second method produces a &quot;trivalent&quot; tuning with<br/>       three such step sizes.</p><p>       Using either of these methods, and starting within<br/>       the resulting octave species from the scale degree a<br/>       neutral seventh above the note which served as the<br/>       origin of the chain of neutral thirds, we find a<br/>       Mohajira mode in the sense of definition (1). Thus<br/>       the two definitions are connected.</p><p>       It should be noted as a property of the second<br/>       method chaining two unequal neutral thirds that<br/>       if the smaller precedes the larger (e.g. 32:39:48),<br/>       then the resulting Mohajira mode on the seventh<br/>       step of the resulting octave species will feature<br/>       _larger_ neutral intervals above this step; while<br/>       a chain where the larger neutral third precedes<br/>       the smaller (e.g. 22:27:33) will feature a Mohajira<br/>       mode with smaller neutral intervals above this step.<br/>       The resulting tetrachords of the Mohajira mode in<br/>       these two examples would be 1/1-128/117-16/13-4/3<br/>       (0-155-359-498 cents), or 128:117-9:8-13:12<br/>       (155-204-139 cents); and 1/1-88/81-11/9-3/2<br/>       (0-143-347-498 cents), or 88:81-9:8-12:11<br/>       (143-204-151 cents).</p><p>My purpose is to suggest a definition of Mohajira that will<br/>embrace both the tetrachord or mode and the method of scale<br/>generation, and to honor the composition and experiences<br/>which inspired this worthy term.</p><p>It is curious and enlightening how claims of either complete<br/>originality or definitive precedent can often be elusive.<br/>Perhaps that is one precious lesson of a thread which has<br/>illuminated some of the origins of a most beautiful term<br/>which I am delighted to embrace.</p><p>With deepest thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/2010 5:06:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 18 May 2010, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; and by raising the fifth degree:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Sikah           Mrad&apos;s &grave;Iraq           Rast<br/>&gt;    |--------------|-----------------------|------------|<br/>&gt;    0    132      341     495      705    837   1046  1200<br/>&gt;      132    209      154     209      132   209   154<br/>&gt;    |---------------------|         |-------------------|<br/>&gt;           &grave;Iraq             tone            &grave;Iraq<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; shown above.
