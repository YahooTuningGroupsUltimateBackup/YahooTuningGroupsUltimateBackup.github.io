I found<br/>that 19 allowed me to extend, in numerous ways, the genres of blues,<br/>jazz, country, etc...in fact, most of Western derived music. The 34 came<br/>by way of the late Larry Hanson, who saw my name in Reinhard&apos;s AFMM<br/>program in 1994, and called to ask if I would be interested in checking<br/>out his 34 tone Telecaster; I said yes, got it in the mail, and fell in<br/>love with the sound, and began working with it. As far as 31, I had<br/>heard Catler&apos;s &quot;Cowpeople&quot; album, and wanted to check it out...I had a<br/>guitar refretted (which is now yours, of course), and enjoyed the<br/>shimering chordal sounds available in that tuning. Besides these eq<br/>temps, I have composed in a pure tuning I came up with, and when I<br/>played with a couple of koto players in town, I tuned to my own<br/>aproximation of a koto (on acoustic fretless).<br/>   Of course, while messing with these guitars, I also tried to read a<br/>lot of books/papers on the subject of tunings, including much<br/>correspondence on this list. From my playing and theoretical studies, I<br/>have arrived at my present state of...???<br/>In other words, I&apos;m open to learning as much as possible about tuning,<br/>and looking for new, unexplored horizons. I would be happy to try many<br/>other systems, but as a guitarist, that means having the instruments,<br/>which costs $$$. I also have a huge backlog of unrecorded compositions,<br/>many in 12 eq, some of which I will move into other tunings, some which<br/>will stay in 12; so, I&apos;m pretty well set for the forseeable future, in<br/>terms of putting out CD&apos;s of original compositions. And, of course, my<br/>time is not as free as I would like for musical studies; being a single<br/>dad is a full time responsibility, one which I enjoy immensely. I&apos;m<br/>pretty happy with the state of my music, and, again, wide open to any<br/>new or unusual concepts that may come my way...hope that answers your<br/>questions...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=31315 href="#31315">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 10:51:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In other words, I&apos;m open to learning as much as possible about<br/>tuning,<br/>&gt; and looking for new, unexplored horizons.</p><p>Hope this list is helping!</p></div>
