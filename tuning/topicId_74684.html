Thanks!</p><p>For instance let&apos;s talk about the smallest interval of a tuning system.<br/>If it is smaller than the one of the tuning system of the considered<br/>musical tradition, I would say that the music on that tuning system<br/>is microtonal.</p><p>On the contrary, if that interval happens to be wider than the one<br/>of the standard tuning system, then you can indeed call the music<br/>macrotonal (I would!). And then, the music in the 12-equal temperament<br/>would be macrotonal for classic arab musicians and Thai traditional<br/>music would be macrotonal to Western music in general.</p><p>The only thing is that, for example, if LucyTuning was the standard tuning system,<br/>then most of the tuning systems in use would be macrotonal! haha! end of microtonality!<br/>just a joke! but not that joke, microtonality has almost been abolished<br/>by the AFMM which has taken the interval of a cent as the smallest standard<br/>interval. I have been listening the Pitch CD collection and it is amazing how<br/>precisely the 1200-equal temperament bassoon can play with the 31-equal temperament<br/>macrotonal guitar. Hurray Johnny!</p><p>Can you see how things can be reversed? ... but I think, that to avoid confusion<br/>I&apos;d rather stick to the term microtonal to define strictly intervals which are not in<br/>the standard tuning system whether they are smaller or in all kind of sizes, or<br/>tunings containing at the least one interval that is not in the standard tuning.</p><p>I would say Greenwich is the standard with its 24 pitches at this time in the history<br/>of music and the minutes and seconds are microtonal positions.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p>Tony Salinas</p></div><h3><a id=74709 href="#74709">ðŸ”—</a>J.A.Martin Salinas &#x3C;tony@tonysalinas.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2007 5:31:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>Not being involved yet! with electroacoustic music I think in terms of what instruments<br/>can sustain and change: volume, pitch, rhythm, and timbre (please remind me<br/>if I forgot something else!)</p><p>Cage succeeded without putting much attention to pitch, and Harry Partch<br/>focussing mainly on pitch, but what makes them great composers is their<br/>exploration of timbre and sound spectrum.</p><p>I think that Partch&apos;s attitude and obsession about tunings is what opened<br/>him the doors to his magic world of sound.
