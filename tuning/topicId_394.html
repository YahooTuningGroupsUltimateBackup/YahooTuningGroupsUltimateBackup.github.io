I have more thoughts, and an offer, that I&apos;ll save<br/>for another post, but one passage struck my attention from a different<br/>perspective:</p><p>&gt;To me, the idea of a &quot;defective ear&quot; is not an insult or a putdown:<br/>&gt;it&apos;s a simple medical fact.</p><p>That reminded me that mclaren and I had had a sharp exchange on PM not<br/>long before its death, and I think that exchange has resulted in some<br/>misunderstandings, which I would like to correct.</p><p>It started with my rather ill-considered statement that 12-tET major<br/>thirds &quot;suck&quot;.  This is one of those off-the-cuff remarks which, in<br/>hindsight, I might have wished to word more carefully.  Nevertheless,<br/>it _does_ reflect my own bias, if nothing else.</p><p>In his response, mclaren said something like, &quot;Well then, you must be<br/>saying that my ear is defective, since I like 12-tET major thirds.&quot;<br/>(apologies for any mis-quoting from memory).  My response to that was,<br/>IIRC, &quot;You have the ear you have.&quot;</p><p>In a much more recent post, mclaren includes this on a list of<br/>grievances against me.</p><p>In fact, mclaren, my guess is that your ear is probably, if anything,<br/>more sensitive than mine.  I make that guess without having much<br/>knowledge about you from this standpoint, but I know you&apos;ve worked with<br/>a lot of different tunings, which would both require and foster an<br/>ear sensitive to small nuances.  My own talent in this regard is perhaps<br/>average or at most a notch above.</p><p>It _is_ true that I love to adaptively tune works that have begun life<br/>in 12-tET.  My ear is sensitive enough to discern the difference (as I&apos;m<br/>sure yours is as well).  We apparently disagree as to whether the effect<br/>is pleasing or not; I happen to think it&apos;s wonderful!  Other people<br/>think it&apos;s a mistake even to consider touching works in this way, and<br/>I respect their views, even if I don&apos;t let that disapproval stop from<br/>pursuing what _I_ think is beautiful.</p><p>If I have come off as insulting your abilities, I sincerely apologize,<br/>and hope that I have succeeded in correcting that implication.</p><p>On a somewhat related topic: that 19th century guy we&apos;ve quarreled<br/>about recently.  Please understand, I _do_ recognize that consonance is<br/>not the be-all and end-all in music.  You have files which &quot;prove&quot; that<br/>the ear can be fooled; I don&apos;t doubt that&apos;s true.  Also I don&apos;t doubt<br/>that wonderful music can be written without a single consonance from<br/>beginning to end.  In this regard, I still have a lot of learning to do,<br/>since I&apos;ve concentrated so much on achieving the highest possible<br/>consonance, both in my own music and in my treatments of others&apos;.  I<br/>don&apos;t doubt that you have much to teach, and I&apos;d be a fool to let any<br/>disagreements block me from learning all I can from you, or from anyone<br/>else for that matter.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
