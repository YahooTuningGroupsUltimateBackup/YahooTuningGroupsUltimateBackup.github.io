Bending to show pitch<br/>radially loses too much other info for my liking.</p><p>However, these prompted me to draw (by hand) a similar distorted lattice<br/>for Lumma&apos;s scale (the 7-limit 12-tone wafso-just one where the 225/224<br/>disappears). In this case I was not attempting to display pitch, only to<br/>show all linkages without repetition of notes. i.e. Within the one plane I<br/>bent the 7-limit triangular lattice around in a circle and joined it up to<br/>itself (the snake eating its own tail). Alas, the distortion was too great<br/>and (almost) all sense of triangles (triads), terahedra (tetrads) and the<br/>octahedron (hexany) were lost.</p><p>It is much easier to understand it as a periodic (i.e. repeating) 3D<br/>lattice. I&apos;ve drawn a single period below in the way which has minimum<br/>duplication, i.e. I&apos;ve cut the chain at its weakest link (the E-G minor<br/>third). This puts the hexany at the center too. You could wrap it around to<br/>make a cylinder (e to E and g to G).</p><p>               a---------e<br/>              /|\       /|\<br/>             / | \     / | \<br/>            /  D#--------A# \<br/>           /,&apos;/:\&grave;.\ /,&apos;/  &grave;.\<br/>          f--/-:-\--c--/------g<br/>         /|\/  :  \/| /<br/>        / |/\  :  /\|/<br/>E---------B---------F#<br/> \&grave;.  /,&apos;/ \&grave;.\:/,&apos;/<br/>  \  db-/---\--ab /<br/>   \ | /     \ | /<br/>    \|/       \|/<br/>     G---------D</p><p>I think this helps to understand the harmonies and harmonic progressions<br/>available in this tuning better than any of the previous drawings Carl or I<br/>gave. I&apos;ve used upper and lower case to try to assist in seeing the depth,<br/>i.e. the two 5-limit planes, upper case in front and lower case behind. Not<br/>sure if it really helps.</p><p>D#:Ab is 6.5 cents away from being an 8:11 (shown dotted above) and A#:Ab<br/>is x cents away from being a 6:11. This isn&apos;t close enough to be useful,<br/>but if they were included in the temper, a 6:8:11 triad (A#:D#:Ab) might be<br/>possible (for whatever that&apos;s worth) without damaging the other harmonies<br/>too much.</p><p>C or F# or both might also be added to this for some pretty weird chords.<br/>i.e. subsets of</p><p>a#   C    D#   F#   Ab  A#  C&apos;  D#&apos; F#&apos; Ab&apos; A#&apos;<br/>6         8         11  12      16      22  24<br/>     5         7    8       10      14  16<br/>1/16 1/14 1/12 1/10     1/8 1/7 1/6 1/5     1/4</p><p>Hey that&apos;s even a kind of interesting pentatonic on A#.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2357 href="#2357">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Your lattices do not make it<br/>possible to see the order of pitch of the notes in a scale. So in my view,<br/>the use of angles derived from pitch ends up serving no useful purpose. As I<br/>have told you before, I feel that your lattices would be improved if either<br/>(a) you dropped the whole pitch-angle idea and used angles that made<br/>simple-integer ratios (like 6/5) look closer together than more complex ones<br/>(like 15/8); or (b) you chose angles in accordance with Canright&apos;s procedure<br/>so that the pitch order would appear naturally on one axis.</p></div>
