This fact is<br/>&gt;&gt;corroborated by the history of the pitch of organs; by the history<br/>&gt;&gt;of music, which shows that organs were used in combination with<br/>&gt;&gt;other instrument, making it obligatory for the organist to<br/>&gt;&gt;transpose every now and then; and by the fact that the meantone<br/>&gt;&gt;temperament was the standard temperament to the Northern German<br/>&gt;&gt;organ building tradition to which Schnitger belonged.</p><p>&gt; Is this Schnitger related to Arp Schnitger</p><p>yes<br/>Frans Caspar Schnitger (senior) was a son of Arp Schnitger</p><p>&gt; who was Andreas Werckmeister&apos;s friend?</p><p>Arp Schnitger knew Werckmeister.<br/>And Schnitger met Buxtehude, as well as Werckmeister.</p><p>Whether all these were already friends, only because they lived in<br/>the same larger region and in the same era and met once or twice,<br/>we don&apos;t know enough!<br/>Too easily links and conclusions have been drawn from very few<br/>evidence.</p><p>Yes, Arp Schnitger wrote a praise poem for Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>&quot;Orgelprobe&quot; and he visited him once.</p><p>But the evidence in preserved evidence in documents of Schnitger<br/>organs shows only meantone temperament in his work (today only 2<br/>of his organs have his soundscape in terms of temperament:<br/>L&uuml;dingworth and Eenum. Stade-Cosmae and Norden are next best<br/>approximations, though &quot;modifications&quot; can&apos;t be proven anywhere).<br/>regarding the usual terminology of the time applied to standard<br/>meantone temperament in examination reports in Norther Germany and<br/>the Netherlands (like &quot;pure harmony&quot;, &quot;pure accord&quot; etc.). Around<br/>the many documents on organs of and around schnitger, there is not<br/>one, showing that he or his contemporaries in Northern Germany<br/>used something different from meantone temperament. All arguments<br/>for well-temperaments have not been derived from physical or<br/>documented evidence!</p><p>Schnitger praises especially the use of Werckmeister&apos;s advice how<br/>to examine an organ (that is what he wrote the &quot;Orgelprobe&quot; for).<br/>Unlike today, organ examinations were a work of days (up to 10,<br/>even 20 days in large organs).  But as a famous North German<br/>organist in 1710 wrote, the temperament is the most important in<br/>organ examination:  It was Schnitger&apos;s friend (really!), the<br/>organist Vincent L&uuml;beck, for 40 years at the brand new, largest<br/>4-manual-organ from Schnitger in St. Nikolai, Hamburg. And<br/>especially Vincent L&uuml;beck praised 1698 in the examination of the<br/>also totally new Schnitger-organ in Bremen-Dom (cathedral) that<br/>the (unspecified) temperament was excellently carried out. And<br/>from the reports in 1755 we learn that that organ was still in<br/>meantone temperament. (This is only a small and well-known part of<br/>the evidence, which I&apos;ll go to present in my future diss. - a lot<br/>more to come)</p><p>And I can&apos;t help to see some irony in Schnitger&apos;s poem towards<br/>Andreas Werckmeister:</p><p>&quot;What would it (the organ, &quot;das Orgelwerck&quot;) be, if it<br/> would be full of defects [Faut=Fehler]?<br/> What purpose should the organ serve  then [in such a<br/> defective state]? It would sound strange.<br/> Take away from this art the pure harmony [!]<br/> and look [notice]! a mere howling will remain here,&quot;<br/>&quot;...<br/> Was aber wolt es seyn, wenn es w&auml;r voller Fauten<br/> Was solt die Orgel denn? Sie w&uuml;rde seltzam lauuten.<br/> Nim Weg von dieser Kunst die reine Harmonie,<br/> Und schau! ein blo&szlig; Geheul wird &uuml;ber bleiben hie,<br/> ...&quot;</p><p>And Werckmeister in all his writings (lots about temperament)<br/>mentions Schnitger once: when it comes to the weight of pipes.<br/>As W. himself states, he considered the organ builders to be<br/>stubborn and they wouldn&apos;t do his wonderful new ideas. And in his<br/>later writings he is desperate to defend him agianst all the<br/>&quot;nerds&quot;. If Schnitger or Buxtehude would be of any support, why<br/>didn&apos;t they support Werckmeister&apos;s ideas.  Why doesn&apos;t he report<br/>on any actual organ (if ther were one), where people could hear<br/>something, at least similar to his ideas (same is true for his<br/>colleague and friend Bendeler&apos;s writings and well-tempered<br/>suggestions!).<br/>The only organ builder he vaguely connects to temperament in all<br/>his 25 years of many publications is Zacharias Thayssner, and only<br/>once - though they cooperated 1677 on the new organ in<br/>Quedlinburg, where Werckmeister and Bendeler were in charge. And<br/>there and in his writings he fails to report, which temperament<br/>Thayssner actually tuned.</p><p>Friends?  May be.  They knew each other, may be agreed on many<br/>things. The discussion in printed matter on the temperament issues<br/>did obviosly not belong to the items they agreed upon.<br/>Practice vs. theory?</p><p>In Northern Germany and the Netherlands in many cases, even large<br/>city organs, it took sometimes until far into the 19th century<br/>until they got tuned to another temperament... and equal<br/>temperament (approx.) was then already a frequent or even<br/>&quot;natural&quot; choice - if the organ was not even replaced completely!</p><p>&gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>best<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>Office: FON +46 31 773 5208 - FAX +46 31 773 5200</p></div>
