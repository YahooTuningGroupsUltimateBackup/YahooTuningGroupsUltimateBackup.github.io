While the focus of the concerts over the past decade has never<br/>been explicitly microtonal music, but rather a wide variety of what might be<br/>termed &quot;post-minimal&quot; approaches to tonality, the alternatives to 12tet<br/>presented were striking in their normalcy within the new music scene. Indeed,<br/>even most of those composers with 12tet works on the program (myself included<br/>in this case, but also Hauke Harder, Maria de Alvear, Markus Trunk,<br/>Ernstalbrecht Stiebler) are also actively making pieces outside of 12tet.</p><p>Three composers programmed last week should be mentioned in particular, in<br/>that they come from rather distant corners of the avant garde community:<br/>Wolfgang von Schweinitz&apos;s works of the last few years have featured an<br/>intensive engagement with a JI lattice derived from Helmholtz. His new work,<br/>for solo trombone, used (sung and played) multiphonics to create &apos;natural&apos;<br/>ring modulation. Peter Ablinger&apos;s piece for solo flute(s) and electronics<br/>used several equal divisions of a perfect fourth, the smallest with intervals<br/>of 20 cents. Alvin Lucier&apos;s _Music for Piano with Slow Sweep Pure Wave<br/>Oscillators_, a work typical of Lucier&apos;s music in the last 15 years, was<br/>entirely composed of beats between the fixed pitches of the piano and two<br/>sweeping sine waves, making microtonal music on the piano without use of a<br/>tuning hammer.</p><p>A glance at the two most recent issues of MusikTexte also show evidence of<br/>the ubiquity of alternative intonation:  Manfred Stanke, a former student of<br/>Ligeti and Johnston, uses a huge variety of tunings within single works;<br/>Carola Bauckholt and Maria De Alvear, both from the school of Kagel, use<br/>microtones as a matter of course; add in a &quot;new complexity&quot; composer here or<br/>one of the &quot;musique spectrale&quot; composers there and &quot;alternative intonation&quot;<br/>starts to sound like a non-issue.</p></div><h3><a id=4751 href="#4751">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/1999 8:18:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Daniel Wolf, TD 309.12]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A glance at the two most recent issues of MusikTexte also<br/>&gt; show evidence of the ubiquity of alternative intonation:<br/>&gt;  Manfred Stanke, a former student of Ligeti and Johnston,<br/>&gt; uses a huge variety of tunings within single works;</p><p>On a visit to Johnny Reinhard last year, Johnny played Stanke&apos;s<br/>_Trace_ for me and I found it to be a magnificent and highly<br/>complex work.
