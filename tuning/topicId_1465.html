But to have done better by it would<br/>&gt; have required a notation for and a chromatic<br/>&gt; of 144 tones [i.e., Stearns&apos;s notation],<br/>&gt; which, it seemed to me, would introduce<br/>&gt; more inconvenience than the slight inaccuracy<br/>&gt; seemed likely to do.  I&apos;m not convinced that<br/>&gt; we need the 13th harmonic yet, anyhow, or<br/>&gt; that our performers are ready for it.</p><p>I wish to emphasize that last sentence, because<br/>Sims considers his &quot;basic scale&quot; to represent<br/>harmonics as high as the 37th!  And when determining<br/>his upper harmonies by summation tones of the<br/>lower notes in the chord, he sometimes goes far<br/>higher in the odd/prime series than that.  But<br/>here he is stating quite matter-of-factly that<br/>he doesn&apos;t expect performers to acheive an accuracy<br/>beyond the 11-limit, and implying that listeners<br/>can&apos;t tell the difference anyway. (remember,<br/>11-limit worked for Partch!)</p><p>This article, BTW, is a very thorough explanation<br/>of how Sims uses 72-Eq to represent JI.<br/>Recommended for all those who like 72-Eq notation.<br/>(I do.)</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
