Dan, Kraig, et al., :</p><p>I looked in my notes last night and was quite surprised with what I<br/>found.  I have notes in several places to the effect that Erv said that<br/>the stellated eikosany has 92 tones. I also found a note saying that my<br/>1981 formula is correct at least for the stellated 2)4 hexany and the<br/>stellated 3)6  eiksosany. Alas, I didn&apos;t find any suggestions as to how<br/>I derived it.</p><p>My formula may apply only to R)N CPS when R= N/2.  In these cases, the<br/>number of tones<br/>S= 2*P-C where P and C are computed according to the following formulae:</p><p>P =  (N+R-1)!  &#x9;<br/>    ----------                &#x9;<br/>     R!(N-1)!  &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;</p><p>and</p><p>C=   N1<br/>   ------<br/>   R!(N-R)!</p><p>Using these formulas I get 14 for the stellated 2)4 hexany and 92 for<br/>the stellated 3)6<br/>20-any. The stellated 4)8 70-any would then have 590 tones.</p><p>I can account for the 14 tones of the stellated hexany and the 92 of the<br/>20-any by brute force and symmetry. The hexany case is well-known, so I<br/>won&apos;t discuss it here, but the 3)6 20-any is not obvious, at least to me<br/>this AM (I still have mild hypocaffeinemia).</p><p>For the general generating hexad A.B.C.D.E.F, each tetrad &quot;facet&quot;  is a<br/>set of four products of three factors of the form A*E*F, B*E*F, C*E*F,<br/>D*E*F. To complete the hexad, we must add<br/>two extra tones E*E*F  and F*E*F  to each tetrad. There are 15 such<br/>harmonic tetrads (six items, 4 at a time) and hence 30 extra tones must<br/>be added. The subharmonic facets, of which there are also 15, have the<br/>form A*B*C, A*B*D, A*C*D, and B*C*D, corresponding to sub-D, Sub-C,<br/>Sub-B and Sub-A respectively. To these we add A*B*C*D/E and A*B*C*D/F.<br/>Since there are 15 subharmonic tetrads, this accounts for an additional<br/>30 tones or 80 tones in all.</p><p>However, six new incomplete harmonic hexads are created by the addition<br/>of the first 30 tones above. These are formed by the notes E*E*F and<br/>F*F*E for all selections of 2 factors from the 6 of the generator. To<br/>complete these hexads, we must add 6 more tones of the form E*E*E to<br/>generate chordal sets such as A*E*E, B*E*E, C*E*E, D*E*E, F*E*E and<br/>E*E*E for all such combinations of the factors. This step adds 6 more<br/>tones and makes 86 in altogether.</p><p>By symmetry, six more tones must be added to the 86 tones above to<br/>complete the subharmonic facets. I seem to be dense this AM and am not<br/>sure exactly what form these 6 tones must have. My guess is that they<br/>are of the form A*B*C*D*E, A*B*C*D*F, corresponding to Sub-F, Sub-E,<br/>etc. These tones raise the total to 92, in agreement with Erv&apos;s number.</p><p>(One might add two more tones, A*B*C*D*E*F and A*B*C*D*E*F/A*B*C*D*E*F<br/>or 1/1 as well and I have a vague recollection of seeing them on a<br/>diagram some time in the past.)</p><p>We might just decide to punt and ask the master himself.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2000 8:12:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[John Chalmers wrote...]<br/>&gt;However, six new incomplete harmonic hexads are created by the addition<br/>&gt;of the first 30 tones above.</p><p>Right.  Perhaps we should call the 96-tone structure some sort of &quot;2nd-<br/>iteration stellation&quot;. :)  The 1st stellation might be of interest to<br/>somebody, no?</p><p>&gt;These are formed by the notes E*E*F and F*F*E for all selections of 2<br/>&gt;factors from the 6 of the generator.</p><p>Remembering that the x)6 CPSs mate to form the 6-factor Euler-Fokker<br/>genus, it&apos;s no suprise that we run up against Pentadekanies when<br/>stellating the Eikosany.  As above, stellating these adjacent<br/>Pentadekanies doesn&apos;t really strike me as the thing to do.</p><p>I believe your 96-tone structure is actually a stellated E.F. genus,<br/>and I wonder if your 570-tone is?  The 2)4 is adjacent to the basic,<br/>completed 4-factor chords, and thus requires only a single iteration<br/>of stellation to become a stellated E.F. genus.  The 3)6 must cross a<br/>pair of neighboring m-1)n, m+1)n CPSs to reach the basic hexads, and<br/>thus it takes two interations to become a stellated EFG.  The 4)8 will<br/>have more than one pair of neighbors -- how many &quot;iterations&quot; does<br/>your formula perform?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2000 3:13:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I believe your 96-tone structure is actually a stellated E.F. genus,</p><p>Carl, I doubt that -- as I&apos;ve noted, the E.F. genus is symmetrical in<br/>the square lattice, while the CPSs and their stellations are<br/>symmetrical in the triangular lattice.

It<br/>shows the 1.3.5.7.9.11 Euler-Fokker genus (which Wilson calls<br/>the &quot;Grand Slam&quot;) in four different lattice orientations. The Figures<br/>37 and 36 should be familiar from our previous discussions -- the<br/>symmetrical figure at the center of each is of course the Eikosany,<br/>using the centered pentagon lattice, with different lines made<br/>visible in each case. The Stellated Eikosany would be as symmetrical<br/>as the Eikosany itself, while the E.F. genus, as you can see, is<br/>elongated in one direction. Figure 35 is how Fokker would probably<br/>lattice the thing -- using four directions for the four primes 3, 5,<br/>7, and 11. The factor of 9 accounts for the basic hypercube structure<br/>being repeated two extra times along the 3 axis. Figure 34 is a<br/>Wilson variation that can be better understood by looking at<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal23.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal23.html</a>.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2000 6:59:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Yeah, it was a shot in the dark, but... the 4-factor stellated 1:2<br/>&gt;&gt;CPS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Huh?</p><p>I just meant the stellated hexany.

But my second question is a<br/>little more arcane; is there any structure, containing incomplete<br/>chords, such that every time you complete all the chords you create<br/>new structure with some incomplete chords?
