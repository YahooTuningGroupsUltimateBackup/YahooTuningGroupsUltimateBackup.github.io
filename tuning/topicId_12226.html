The cuneiform tuning tables give no hint of the<br/>numerical relations between string lengths and pitch. His school also<br/>seems to have been the first to discover irrational numbers and to<br/>explore elementary number theory.</p><p>Later the tradition degenerated into mysticism.</p><p>Siemen: Greetings, welcome back to the States.</p><p>--John</p></div>
