If we move from C7 to F7, this tritone moves down a semitone while the 3-7 are inverted; 3-7 = E-Bb in C7 becomes 7-3 = Eb-A in F7.

Continuing, Bm7(b5), E7, Am7, Ab7(b5), &gt; G7.<br/>&gt;<br/>After 7/5- chord usually 7maj is used in similar progressions.  Dominant 7th chord half tone down doesn&apos;t sound well here.</p><p>&gt; Or we could substitute the 7 with a 7(b9) which is the same as &gt; taking a diminished 7 chord from its b2, ma3, 5 or b7.<br/>&gt;<br/>It&apos;s not the same, you should repeat your harmony lessons, but with better teacher or better books. Diminished 7th chords on different notes are always different. Only if you make inversions, they have the same notes in different permutations. In no case C7dim is the same chord as Eb7dim, D#7dim, Gb7dim, F#7dim, A7dim or B#7dim. Not on this planet :-) Exactly this difference in enharmonic spelling is used for one kind of modulation through 7dim chord.</p><p>&gt; Dm7, G7, Cma7 becomes Dm7, Ddim,<br/>&gt;</p><p>If you mean G9- for the second chord, then you have to use G in bass and B7dim (in any inversion) as a chord. Not D7dim. They are definitely different chords. Try to forget standard keyboard for visualisation of chords. Or improve your imagination.</p><p>&gt; Cma7. Or try G13(b9) = G-F-Ab-B-E, Cma7.<br/>&gt;</p><p>When we use 5-voice or 6-voice voicing, we usually keep it for all chords in the progression to avoid unison or octave doubling. Golden rule of a good arranger. So I would do C9/7maj as last chord, and when it should continue, also C9 would be possible. Imagine for example sax quartet plus bass.</p><p>&gt; Though this would be technically classified as a &apos;dissonance&apos; it is &gt; probably *the* most beautiful substitution for the V7 in a major key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or for more rocky/funky music we can begin to introduce our &apos;nasty&apos; &gt; chords. E7(#9), the Jimmy Hendrix chord, incorporated the major and &gt; minor thirds simultaneously. Better still, E13(#9) = E-G#-D-A(bb)-&gt; C# has two tritones and sounds great in context.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s of course true, but strictly speaking G#-D is not tritone, but diminished fifth. Besides I see some very strange triple augmented third, not tritone. Tritone would be Abb-Db or  G-C#. But for the chords which cross the border of thirdal harmony, or combine thirdal and quartal harmony, it&apos;s very often better to use the simplest way of writing, out of tonality, more like atonal way. So here you can write E-G#-D-G-C#.</p><p>Take the chord C-E-G-Bb-Eb-Ab-Db-Gb as an example. It should be written enharmonically properly in C major as C-E-G-Bb-D#-Ab-Db-F# (then it&apos;s easily recognizable as thirdal chord C13-/11+/9+/9-/7), but it&apos;s difficult to read and quartal structure of upper part is not well visible on the first sight.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am of course only scratching the surface. But I think that I&apos;ve &gt; made my point that the b5th interval is absolutely indispensable to &gt; 12TET harmony. It appears everywhere within chords and between &gt; them.

Its special unstable dissonance was always understood this way, in the middle age it was considered to be &quot;a devil in music&quot; (diabolus in musica) and avoided, even so, that whole concept of 1st/5th grade in old modes was heavily distorted by this, and later tritone always had to be resolved etc. It even become a symbol of something satanic, demonic (my theory is because tritone number is 6, and satanists like 666), and the first composer using this connotation was Carl Maria von Weber, later Mussorgski, Liszt, and mainly Skriabin (Satanic Poem, some sonatas... - he was obsessed by tritone and symmetry). Even until now you can hear tritone in every criminal film or horror ad nauseam as a symbol of evil, tension....</p><p>Daniel Forro</p></div><h3><a id=88082 href="#88082">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 11:35:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 25 Apr 2010, at 7:46 PM, rick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Michael,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that much of the traditional language and approach<br/>&gt; &gt; to questions of tuning still comes from the classical tradition of<br/>&gt; &gt; triadic harmony.

In terms of practice, the ear hears the same 4 notes which is why one can be substituted for the other. Knowing this we can now cycle down chromatically. But if we imagine that these are not the same chord and then go about trying to &apos;tune&apos; them differently then we are destroying that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and we get Bm7(b5), E7, Am7. Continuing, Bm7(b5), E7, Am7, Ab7(b5),<br/>&gt; &gt; G7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; After 7/5- chord usually 7maj is used in similar progressions.<br/>&gt; Dominant 7th chord half tone down doesn&apos;t sound well here.</p><p>First I didn&apos;t say dom7 semitone below but that if we go from V7 to I7 the tritone (b5) between the third and seventh degrees descend chromatically. Second, of course V7 to Ima7 sounds good. But V7 to I7 is in every single blues song ever written. It is *by definition* the blues. There are literally thousands of other examples one could cite.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or we could substitute the 7 with a 7(b9) which is the same as<br/>&gt; &gt; taking a diminished 7 chord from its b2, ma3, 5 or b7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not the same, you should repeat your harmony lessons, but with<br/>&gt; better teacher or better books.

Not on<br/>&gt; this planet :-) Exactly this difference in enharmonic spelling is<br/>&gt; used for one kind of modulation through 7dim chord.</p><p>Daniel, be nice. I&apos;ve been a prof muso for 30 years. One must also keep in mind the practicalities of music. If I was to write double flats for your average jazz musician they&apos;d laugh at the pretension. Plus it woud probably not be read very quickly. What I&apos;m saying is this. Instead of G7, take G7(b9) = G-B-D-F-Ab. Notice that this is a Bdim7 over a G bass. Ah, but we can invert this dim chord simply by moving it up or down minor thirds. Since &apos;enharmonically&apos; Abdim7 = Bdim7 = Ddim7 = Fdim7 then we can move to tonic C from any of these chords. More interesting still is the possibility for modulation it opens up. We could instead come out at tonics that are minor thirds away from C. Bach for eg did this all the time. Once again, if we think of these as being different because we simply wish to introduce different tunings for each chord then we are destroying it. [2^(1/4)]^4 = 2 is the best possible tuning for this chord because it is symmetric by definition. What we call the notes afterwards is only a matter of convention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dm7, G7, Cma7 becomes Dm7, Ddim,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you mean G9- for the second chord, then you have to use G in bass<br/>&gt; and B7dim (in any inversion) as a chord. Not D7dim. They are<br/>&gt; definitely different chords. Try to forget standard keyboard for<br/>&gt; visualisation of chords. Or improve your imagination.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cma7. Or try G13(b9) = G-F-Ab-B-E, Cma7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When we use 5-voice or 6-voice voicing, we usually keep it for all<br/>&gt; chords in the progression to avoid unison or octave doubling. Golden<br/>&gt; rule of a good arranger. So I would do C9/7maj as last chord, and<br/>&gt; when it should continue, also C9 would be possible. Imagine for<br/>&gt; example sax quartet plus bass.</p><p>C9 is a dominant 7 chord with the 9th added. It is distinct from Cma9 which is a ma7 or Cadd9 which is simply a C triad with 9 added. As for voicings, I am a professional arranger. It&apos;s what I do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Though this would be technically classified as a &apos;dissonance&apos; it is<br/>&gt; &gt; probably *the* most beautiful substitution for the V7 in a major key.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or for more rocky/funky music we can begin to introduce our &apos;nasty&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; chords. E7(#9), the Jimmy Hendrix chord, incorporated the major and<br/>&gt; &gt; minor thirds simultaneously. Better still, E13(#9) = E-G#-D-A(bb)-<br/>&gt; &gt; C# has two tritones and sounds great in context.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s of course true, but strictly speaking G#-D is not tritone, but<br/>&gt; diminished fifth. Besides I see some very strange triple augmented<br/>&gt; third, not tritone. Tritone would be Abb-Db or  G-C#.

There are sometimes mitigating circumstances when arranging. Because horn players tend to read b&apos;s better than #&apos;s and because it&apos;s on a &apos;need to know&apos; basis, I&apos;ll often replace a # with a b if it will make it easier to read. Or for a #9 chord, I&apos;ll give one player a maj third and the other a minor etc...Some jazz composers have even discarded key signatures altogether because they like to modulate allot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am of course only scratching the surface.

Not D7dim. They are definitely different chords. Try to forget standard keyboard for visualisation of chords. Or improve your imagination.&quot;</p><p>Rick&gt; No I didn&apos;t mean G9 which is a G7 with natural 9th. I said G7(b9). Once again we see why &apos;enharmonic spelling&apos; is NOT the correct language for atonality. B7dim and D7dim are absolutely NOT different chords. One is the inversion of the other. Misunderstandings like this is why we use the designations 0,1,2,...11 representing the N in 2^(N/12)instead of letters from the alphabet. Because the letters represent an old language based on tonality and lead to confusion. Since multiplying log&apos;s equals adding exponents, then intervals are determined by the operation of addition/subtraction. The correct mathematics is congruent modulo 12. Two intervals are inverse when they add to 12. Since 12 = 0 (mod 12) then inverses can also be written as negative. 3 + 9 = 12 = 0 are inverse, as are 3 + (-3) = 0. That is, 9 = -3 and 3 = -9 (mod 12).</p><p>Now look at Dim7 0:3:6:9. We might invert it as 0:-3:-6:-9. But this is 0:9:6:3. It has the same interval content. Another way of saying this is that every note is equally qualified to become *the root* 0. If 3 -&gt; 0 then we get -3:0:3:6 = 9:0:3:6. 2nd inv 6-&gt;0 gives -6:-3:0:3 = 6:9:0:3 and finally 9-&gt;0 gives -9:-6:-3:0 = 3:6:9:0. So we see that Dim7 chords by definition *do not have a tonic*. This is because they are invariant with respect to inversion, yielding the same intervals from every point of view.</p><p>Getting back to the original problem, G7(b9) is equivalent to a Bdim7/G i.e. with a G bass.

There&apos;s a &quot;-&quot; sign after my &quot;G9&quot;. Together it makes &quot;G9-&quot;. Because I&apos;m well experienced in jazz theory I will never use chord sign system with &quot;b&quot; and &quot;#&quot; which works only for some chords. The only proper and universal system for all keys and chords is to use &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs for alterations. So if you want to teach me universal systems, you can learn this one as well and avoid using of flats and sharps in chord signs. You can write G9b or G(b9), that&apos;s OK, but if you write for example F#{b9} you will only show lack of knowledge, because there&apos;s no flat ninth interval in that chord. If you want to use accidentals, you must write properly F#9 and natural sign, because G# is changed to G, not to Gb. So it&apos;s not universal system. Capisco?</p><p>Advice 2: It&apos;s very surprising here on tuning group to find another person who doesn&apos;t understand  about enharmonics and what it means for music theory. Don&apos;t argument with atonality, this has nothing to do with atonality. And don&apos;t argument with equal temperament, it doesn&apos;t exist in reality. Despite we have 12tone keyboard, 12tone system exists only in the score. And writing has its rules and distinguish between F and E# for example. There&apos;s a difference between Ab and G#, both in the score and in the real music practice. So if you want to stay in your darkness, you can. But once more I repeat: Bdim7, Ddim7, Fdim7 or Abdim7 are different chords because they have different notes (you can add even Cbdim7, E#dim7 and G#dim7 to your list). Here is your missed lesson:</p><p>Bdim7 = B-D-F-Ab<br/>Ddim7 = D-F-Ab-Cc<br/>Fdim7 = F-Ab-Cb-Ebb<br/>Abdim7 = Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gbb</p><p>Of course each of them has its tonic chord, because they were created on VII grade of the scale. Tonic is always half tone up, and it can be major or minor.</p><p>All my life I fight with the ignorance of half educated music amateurs by explaining what&apos;s wrong, what&apos;s right.

Or improve your imagination.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick&gt; No I didn&apos;t mean G9 which is a G7 with natural 9th. I said G7&gt; (b9). Once again we see why &apos;enharmonic spelling&apos; is NOT the &gt; correct language for atonality. B7dim and D7dim are absolutely NOT &gt; different chords. One is the inversion of the other. &gt; Misunderstandings like this is why we use the designations &gt; 0,1,2,...11 representing the N in 2^(N/12)instead of letters from &gt; the alphabet. Because the letters represent an old language based &gt; on tonality and lead to confusion. Since multiplying log&apos;s equals &gt; adding exponents, then intervals are determined by the operation of &gt; addition/subtraction. The correct mathematics is congruent modulo &gt; 12. Two intervals are inverse when they add to 12. Since 12 = 0 &gt; (mod 12) then inverses can also be written as negative. 3 + 9 = 12 &gt; = 0 are inverse, as are 3 + (-3) = 0. That is, 9 = -3 and 3 = -9 &gt; (mod 12).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now look at Dim7 0:3:6:9. We might invert it as 0:-3:-6:-9. But &gt; this is 0:9:6:3. It has the same interval content. Another way of &gt; saying this is that every note is equally qualified to become *the &gt; root* 0. If 3 -&gt; 0 then we get -3:0:3:6 = 9:0:3:6. 2nd inv 6-&gt;0 &gt; gives -6:-3:0:3 = 6:9:0:3 and finally 9-&gt;0 gives -9:-6:-3:0 = &gt; 3:6:9:0. So we see that Dim7 chords by definition *do not have a &gt; tonic*. This is because they are invariant with respect to &gt; inversion, yielding the same intervals from every point of view.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Getting back to the original problem, G7(b9) is equivalent to a &gt; Bdim7/G i.e. with a G bass.

You&apos;ve got it right. If you want to have 7th chord, it must follow in theory and in the score triadic structure, that means if you remove all accidentals, basic note names must follow triadic pattern (with gap between  neighboring notes). Then even if you will add to each basic note any accidental including double ones, and create quite different chords sounding far from basic seventh chord, they will be always called seventh chord (with alterations of course).</p><p>&gt;    Thus, for example, D F A-flat B can not exist both because there &gt; is not letter gap between A and B and because the interval from D &gt; to C-flat is actually different pitch wise than the interval from D &gt; to B in, say, meantone (since rotation by fifths forward vs. &gt; backward to create all tones produces slightly different intervals)?</p><p>Of course D-F-Ab-B exist, but it is an inversion of seventh chord, because it  hasn&apos;t triadic structure. In such case you can try its inversions until you come to triadic structure. This can be considered as basic shape chord. So here: F-Ab-B-D not triadic, Ab-B-D-F not triadic, B-D-F-Ab triadic, so we found its basic shape and can analyse it as dim7 on VII grade of C major or C minor key.<br/>Of course with some chords is more difficult to reveal their triadic structure, as some notes are missing, or they have quartal structure, or combination of thirdal or quartal. In my personal harmonic theory I count also with secondal structure of chords, clusters, there are more possibilities and all three types can be mixed. For example diatonic C major scale can create secondal chord C-D-E-F-G-A-B (plus another 6 inversions), or thirdal C-E-G-B-D-F-A (plus 6 inversions), or quartal C-F-B-E-A-D-G (plus 6 inversions). Of course it&apos;s possible to add black keys and build maximally 12tone chromatic chords.</p><p>&gt;   Also, the only time C-flat exactly equals B pitch-wise is in &gt; 12TET, correct?</p><p>We can say so as a simplification about pitch and about key on standard keyboard, but notes in the scores are different as well as theoretical consequences, like resolution. But in the reality they can be tuned differently depending on the vertical and horizontal music context. At least there&apos;s some purely psychological difference. There are people with synesthesia, and Ab minor definitely looks differently in the score then G# minor. It can have some impact on the musician performing from the score, especially when he knows something more about harmony, modulations etc. Notation has some rules, and clever composers of tonal and extended tonal music used it intentionally and logically, not randomly. It has some reason why some composition is written in Ab minor and another one in G# minor. And it has also some reason why it&apos;s written in Ab minor and not in G minor. Sometimes the reason is practical - tuning of instruments, easier fingering, sometimes it&apos;s pure magic why it&apos;s so. But when you do transposition, composition can lose its character.</p><p>Even in atonal music it&apos;s possible to recognize educated and careful composer from somebody with less historical background just from the way how the score is written.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;And writing has its rules and distinguish between F and E# for &gt; example.

And just TRY notating 8-note Father temperament using common-practice spellings...not so easy when a fourth equals a third, is it?

You&apos;ve got it right. If you want to have 7th chord,<br/>&gt; it must follow in theory and in the score triadic structure, that<br/>&gt; means if you remove all accidentals, basic note names must follow<br/>&gt; triadic pattern (with gap between  neighboring notes). Then even if<br/>&gt; you will add to each basic note any accidental including double ones,<br/>&gt; and create quite different chords sounding far from basic seventh<br/>&gt; chord, they will be always called seventh chord (with alterations of<br/>&gt; course).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Thus, for example, D F A-flat B can not exist both because there<br/>&gt; &gt; is not letter gap between A and B and because the interval from D<br/>&gt; &gt; to C-flat is actually different pitch wise than the interval from D<br/>&gt; &gt; to B in, say, meantone (since rotation by fifths forward vs.<br/>&gt; &gt; backward to create all tones produces slightly different intervals)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course D-F-Ab-B exist, but it is an inversion of seventh chord,<br/>&gt; because it  hasn&apos;t triadic structure. In such case you can try its<br/>&gt; inversions until you come to triadic structure. This can be<br/>&gt; considered as basic shape chord. So here: F-Ab-B-D not triadic, Ab-B-<br/>&gt; D-F not triadic, B-D-F-Ab triadic, so we found its basic shape and<br/>&gt; can analyse it as dim7 on VII grade of C major or C minor key.<br/>&gt; Of course with some chords is more difficult to reveal their triadic<br/>&gt; structure, as some notes are missing, or they have quartal structure,<br/>&gt; or combination of thirdal or quartal. In my personal harmonic theory<br/>&gt; I count also with secondal structure of chords, clusters, there are<br/>&gt; more possibilities and all three types can be mixed. For example<br/>&gt; diatonic C major scale can create secondal chord C-D-E-F-G-A-B (plus<br/>&gt; another 6 inversions), or thirdal C-E-G-B-D-F-A (plus 6 inversions),<br/>&gt; or quartal C-F-B-E-A-D-G (plus 6 inversions). Of course it&apos;s possible<br/>&gt; to add black keys and build maximally 12tone chromatic chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Also, the only time C-flat exactly equals B pitch-wise is in<br/>&gt; &gt; 12TET, correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can say so as a simplification about pitch and about key on<br/>&gt; standard keyboard, but notes in the scores are different as well as<br/>&gt; theoretical consequences, like resolution. But in the reality they<br/>&gt; can be tuned differently depending on the vertical and horizontal<br/>&gt; music context. At least there&apos;s some purely psychological difference.<br/>&gt; There are people with synesthesia, and Ab minor definitely looks<br/>&gt; differently in the score then G# minor. It can have some impact on<br/>&gt; the musician performing from the score, especially when he knows<br/>&gt; something more about harmony, modulations etc. Notation has some<br/>&gt; rules, and clever composers of tonal and extended tonal music used it<br/>&gt; intentionally and logically, not randomly. It has some reason why<br/>&gt; some composition is written in Ab minor and another one in G# minor.<br/>&gt; And it has also some reason why it&apos;s written in Ab minor and not in G<br/>&gt; minor. Sometimes the reason is practical - tuning of instruments,<br/>&gt; easier fingering, sometimes it&apos;s pure magic why it&apos;s so. But when you<br/>&gt; do transposition, composition can lose its character.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even in atonal music it&apos;s possible to recognize educated and careful<br/>&gt; composer from somebody with less historical background just from the<br/>&gt; way how the score is written.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;And writing has its rules and distinguish between F and E# for<br/>&gt; &gt; example. There&apos;s a difference<br/>&gt; &gt; between Ab and G#, both in the score and in the real music practice. &quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but again is it true E# and F are the<br/>&gt; &gt; same pitch in 12TET,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes and no<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but mean to different things in composition and different intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; in different tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So what advantage of understanding do you get &quot;even&quot; under 12TET by<br/>&gt; &gt; using enharmonic equivalents (beside, say, that the are not two<br/>&gt; &gt; different notes listed under the same letter)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has sense for understanding of older music which was based on<br/>&gt; this, in understanding modulations. Such knowledge is good for<br/>&gt; composing and arranging - to write logical setting of the chords,<br/>&gt; good voicing. In the end it has advantages for performers, as<br/>&gt; logically written score is easily to read, as basic chord structure<br/>&gt; is easily to recognize on the first sight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=88237 href="#88237">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2010 11:26:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The conversation I saw was about notation of functional tall chords, read by humans.

Then priority is readability of individual chords (if there are chords) and  logical context. Before F would be better to write Gb7 (generally in flat keys and chords with flats context), before G or D  - F#7 (generally in &quot;#&quot; keys and chords). Of course there are many chords combining flats and sharps. In atonal music sometimes the decision is difficult and almost everything is possible, but double accidentals are not necessary. We can write both F# or Gb before Dmi.<br/>System using numbers for all chromatic notes can be used for serial and 12tone music, but it has also some disadvantages - there&apos;s no reason to start always from C as this music has no center, another problem are double character numbers 10, 11 and 12 which complicate the reading and can cause errors. When I compose such music, which is very often, and make preparation material, I use note names, that&apos;s easy.

Below you say that &quot;12tET exists only in the score&quot;. But if you actually read some of my recent posts you&apos;ll see that its all about the mathematics of wave theory.</p><p>As for &quot;jazz theory&quot;, well I&apos;m an actual bonefide jazz musician. A guitarists in fact. It&apos;s my job. Throwing a minus sign after a G9 is NOT, I repeat NOT, the correct way to write G7(b9). Why? Because when reading a chart jazz musicians only have a split second to recognise a chord. G9 is a G7 add (natural) 9. If I was to put - after it would go unnoticed. And we all know how &apos;nice&apos; a G9 would sound with a G7(b9). Remember, jazz is an improvised music that is played with *other musicians*. This needs a common, not private, language.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t argument with atonality, this has nothing to do with atonality&quot;. Well I will argument with atonality. The congruent modulo 12 doesn&apos;t exist &quot;only on the score&quot;. If we ask &quot;which interval equals the 8ve when multiplied by itself?&quot;, this becomes a math problem I^2 = 2. It has one and only one solution, I = sqrt2 or 2^(1/2). Observe that [2^(1/2)]/1 = 2/[2^(1/2)] = [2^(1/2)]. Thus the interval gives itself under 8ve inversion. And it is in a manner of speaking a &apos;2tET&apos;. Now if we &quot;imagine&quot; that from C to F# (say) there can be two F#&apos;s, say another called &quot;Gb&quot;, and detune according to some comma problem that came from elsewhere, then we are destroying this symmetry. We would then need to create two C&apos;s to redress the imbalance, B# for eg, and the problem would spiral out of control.</p><p>As I said, the language of enharmonics comes out of questions of tonality, ironing out commas, and so on. It is not particularly well suited for all of those symmetric, passing chords which are necessarily atonal because they don&apos;t have a tonic. This</p><p>&quot;Bdim7 = B-D-F-Ab<br/>&gt; Ddim7 = D-F-Ab-Cc<br/>&gt; Fdim7 = F-Ab-Cb-Ebb<br/>&gt; Abdim7 = Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gbb&quot;</p><p>treats the alphabet notes B, D, F, Ab as if they were &apos;tonics&apos;. What, are you saying the C E G is a C major but E G C is some type of E? Of course these chords are just inversions of one another. But these are not Bmaj, Dmaj etc...Since all intervals bear the same relation to every other, then the chord is atonal and the assumption that the bottom note is the tonic or root is ill founded. Mathematically this solves the problem &quot;what interval gives the 8ve when multiplied by itself 4 times?&quot;. I^4 = 2 has one and only one solution, I = 2^(1/4). In contrast the letter name system is biased toward tonality from the very beginning. Your naming system above is superfluous and overcomplicated. It is certainly not customary in jazz circles.</p><p>-Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Advice 1: read carefully what I have written. There&apos;s a &quot;-&quot; sign<br/>&gt; after my &quot;G9&quot;. Together it makes &quot;G9-&quot;. Because I&apos;m well experienced<br/>&gt; in jazz theory I will never use chord sign system with &quot;b&quot; and &quot;#&quot;<br/>&gt; which works only for some chords. The only proper and universal<br/>&gt; system for all keys and chords is to use &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs for<br/>&gt; alterations. So if you want to teach me universal systems, you can<br/>&gt; learn this one as well and avoid using of flats and sharps in chord<br/>&gt; signs. You can write G9b or G(b9), that&apos;s OK, but if you write for<br/>&gt; example F#{b9} you will only show lack of knowledge, because there&apos;s<br/>&gt; no flat ninth interval in that chord. If you want to use accidentals,<br/>&gt; you must write properly F#9 and natural sign, because G# is changed<br/>&gt; to G, not to Gb. So it&apos;s not universal system. Capisco?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Advice 2: It&apos;s very surprising here on tuning group to find another<br/>&gt; person who doesn&apos;t understand  about enharmonics and what it means<br/>&gt; for music theory. Don&apos;t argument with atonality, this has nothing to<br/>&gt; do with atonality. And don&apos;t argument with equal temperament, it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t exist in reality. Despite we have 12tone keyboard, 12tone<br/>&gt; system exists only in the score. And writing has its rules and<br/>&gt; distinguish between F and E# for example. There&apos;s a difference<br/>&gt; between Ab and G#, both in the score and in the real music practice.<br/>&gt; So if you want to stay in your darkness, you can. But once more I<br/>&gt; repeat: Bdim7, Ddim7, Fdim7 or Abdim7 are different chords because<br/>&gt; they have different notes (you can add even Cbdim7, E#dim7 and G#dim7<br/>&gt; to your list). Here is your missed lesson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bdim7 = B-D-F-Ab<br/>&gt; Ddim7 = D-F-Ab-Cc<br/>&gt; Fdim7 = F-Ab-Cb-Ebb<br/>&gt; Abdim7 = Ab-Cb-Ebb-Gbb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course each of them has its tonic chord, because they were created<br/>&gt; on VII grade of the scale. Tonic is always half tone up, and it can<br/>&gt; be major or minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All my life I fight with the ignorance of half educated music<br/>&gt; amateurs by explaining what&apos;s wrong, what&apos;s right. Lot of them<br/>&gt; learned something from me, forgot their funny theories and were<br/>&gt; happy, because they came to better understanding of music (this is<br/>&gt; not depending on the music style). Some not. Select your way. This is<br/>&gt; an advice, dear friend, not insult.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 26 Apr 2010, at 5:38 PM, rick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Daniel said &quot;If you mean G9- for the second chord, then you have to<br/>&gt; &gt; use G in bass and B7dim (in any inversion) as a chord. Not D7dim.<br/>&gt; &gt; They are definitely different chords. Try to forget standard<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard for visualisation of chords. Or improve your imagination.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rick&gt; No I didn&apos;t mean G9 which is a G7 with natural 9th. I said G7<br/>&gt; &gt; (b9). Once again we see why &apos;enharmonic spelling&apos; is NOT the<br/>&gt; &gt; correct language for atonality. B7dim and D7dim are absolutely NOT<br/>&gt; &gt; different chords. One is the inversion of the other.<br/>&gt; &gt; Misunderstandings like this is why we use the designations<br/>&gt; &gt; 0,1,2,...11 representing the N in 2^(N/12)instead of letters from<br/>&gt; &gt; the alphabet. Because the letters represent an old language based<br/>&gt; &gt; on tonality and lead to confusion. Since multiplying log&apos;s equals<br/>&gt; &gt; adding exponents, then intervals are determined by the operation of<br/>&gt; &gt; addition/subtraction. The correct mathematics is congruent modulo<br/>&gt; &gt; 12. Two intervals are inverse when they add to 12. Since 12 = 0<br/>&gt; &gt; (mod 12) then inverses can also be written as negative. 3 + 9 = 12<br/>&gt; &gt; = 0 are inverse, as are 3 + (-3) = 0. That is, 9 = -3 and 3 = -9<br/>&gt; &gt; (mod 12).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now look at Dim7 0:3:6:9. We might invert it as 0:-3:-6:-9. But<br/>&gt; &gt; this is 0:9:6:3. It has the same interval content. Another way of<br/>&gt; &gt; saying this is that every note is equally qualified to become *the<br/>&gt; &gt; root* 0. If 3 -&gt; 0 then we get -3:0:3:6 = 9:0:3:6. 2nd inv 6-&gt;0<br/>&gt; &gt; gives -6:-3:0:3 = 6:9:0:3 and finally 9-&gt;0 gives -9:-6:-3:0 =<br/>&gt; &gt; 3:6:9:0. So we see that Dim7 chords by definition *do not have a<br/>&gt; &gt; tonic*. This is because they are invariant with respect to<br/>&gt; &gt; inversion, yielding the same intervals from every point of view.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Getting back to the original problem, G7(b9) is equivalent to a<br/>&gt; &gt; Bdim7/G i.e. with a G bass. Ignoring the G altogether we get Bdim7<br/>&gt; &gt; = Ddim7 = Fdim7 = Abdim7 which can now function as the V7 chord to<br/>&gt; &gt; a C tonic. However, by the same syllogistic logic, we could instead<br/>&gt; &gt; think of these as V7 to Eb, Gb or A, that is, minor thirds from C.<br/>&gt; &gt; Notice that we CAN use Eb or D# because these are new keys and no<br/>&gt; &gt; longer have nothing to do with C. A favourite of Bach&apos;s is to use<br/>&gt; &gt; this to come out in the relative minor of major key. For eg, Cmaj<br/>&gt; &gt; to G7 =&gt; G#dim7 =&gt; E7 to Amin.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As a final statement, this congruent modulo maths is the correct<br/>&gt; &gt; language for ANY truly equal temperament.

You&apos;ve got it right. If you want to have 7th chord,<br/>&gt; it must follow in theory and in the score triadic structure, that<br/>&gt; means if you remove all accidentals, basic note names must follow<br/>&gt; triadic pattern (with gap between  neighboring notes). Then even if<br/>&gt; you will add to each basic note any accidental including double ones,<br/>&gt; and create quite different chords sounding far from basic seventh<br/>&gt; chord, they will be always called seventh chord (with alterations of<br/>&gt; course).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    Thus, for example, D F A-flat B can not exist both because there<br/>&gt; &gt; is not letter gap between A and B and because the interval from D<br/>&gt; &gt; to C-flat is actually different pitch wise than the interval from D<br/>&gt; &gt; to B in, say, meantone (since rotation by fifths forward vs.<br/>&gt; &gt; backward to create all tones produces slightly different intervals)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course D-F-Ab-B exist, but it is an inversion of seventh chord,<br/>&gt; because it  hasn&apos;t triadic structure. In such case you can try its<br/>&gt; inversions until you come to triadic structure. This can be<br/>&gt; considered as basic shape chord. So here: F-Ab-B-D not triadic, Ab-B-<br/>&gt; D-F not triadic, B-D-F-Ab triadic, so we found its basic shape and<br/>&gt; can analyse it as dim7 on VII grade of C major or C minor key.<br/>&gt; Of course with some chords is more difficult to reveal their triadic<br/>&gt; structure, as some notes are missing, or they have quartal structure,<br/>&gt; or combination of thirdal or quartal. In my personal harmonic theory<br/>&gt; I count also with secondal structure of chords, clusters, there are<br/>&gt; more possibilities and all three types can be mixed. For example<br/>&gt; diatonic C major scale can create secondal chord C-D-E-F-G-A-B (plus<br/>&gt; another 6 inversions), or thirdal C-E-G-B-D-F-A (plus 6 inversions),<br/>&gt; or quartal C-F-B-E-A-D-G (plus 6 inversions). Of course it&apos;s possible<br/>&gt; to add black keys and build maximally 12tone chromatic chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Also, the only time C-flat exactly equals B pitch-wise is in<br/>&gt; &gt; 12TET, correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can say so as a simplification about pitch and about key on<br/>&gt; standard keyboard, but notes in the scores are different as well as<br/>&gt; theoretical consequences, like resolution. But in the reality they<br/>&gt; can be tuned differently depending on the vertical and horizontal<br/>&gt; music context. At least there&apos;s some purely psychological difference.<br/>&gt; There are people with synesthesia, and Ab minor definitely looks<br/>&gt; differently in the score then G# minor. It can have some impact on<br/>&gt; the musician performing from the score, especially when he knows<br/>&gt; something more about harmony, modulations etc. Notation has some<br/>&gt; rules, and clever composers of tonal and extended tonal music used it<br/>&gt; intentionally and logically, not randomly. It has some reason why<br/>&gt; some composition is written in Ab minor and another one in G# minor.<br/>&gt; And it has also some reason why it&apos;s written in Ab minor and not in G<br/>&gt; minor. Sometimes the reason is practical - tuning of instruments,<br/>&gt; easier fingering, sometimes it&apos;s pure magic why it&apos;s so. But when you<br/>&gt; do transposition, composition can lose its character.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even in atonal music it&apos;s possible to recognize educated and careful<br/>&gt; composer from somebody with less historical background just from the<br/>&gt; way how the score is written.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;And writing has its rules and distinguish between F and E# for<br/>&gt; &gt; example. There&apos;s a difference<br/>&gt; &gt; between Ab and G#, both in the score and in the real music practice. &quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but again is it true E# and F are the<br/>&gt; &gt; same pitch in 12TET,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes and no<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but mean to different things in composition and different intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; in different tunings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So what advantage of understanding do you get &quot;even&quot; under 12TET by<br/>&gt; &gt; using enharmonic equivalents (beside, say, that the are not two<br/>&gt; &gt; different notes listed under the same letter)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has sense for understanding of older music which was based on<br/>&gt; this, in understanding modulations. Such knowledge is good for<br/>&gt; composing and arranging - to write logical setting of the chords,<br/>&gt; good voicing. In the end it has advantages for performers, as<br/>&gt; logically written score is easily to read, as basic chord structure<br/>&gt; is easily to recognize on the first sight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=88282 href="#88282">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 12:14:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>31 I think would be far superior to 19.

But we should<br/>give them names.</p><p>2) &quot;Jazz,&quot; in a more broad, philosophical sense, is more of a<br/>philosophy that could be &quot;run&quot; on any tuning. Consider the following:</p><p>Historically speaking, after plowing into meantone a bit more than was<br/>done common practice music (building off of some of the harmonic ideas<br/>in the late-Romantic era), jazz started to become more about a<br/>systematic exploration of other rank-2 temperaments consistent with<br/>12-equal.<br/>- The concept of tritone substitution, for example, strongly implies a<br/>tempering out of 50/49.<br/>- The use of the blues in 12-tet general could imply an equivocation<br/>between 19/16 and 6/5 (and 7/6 and 32/27 too (and 75/64 if you&apos;re<br/>exceptionally clever)).<br/>- The use of the mixolydian mode in particular to play the blues<br/>implies a tempering out of 64/63, and all of the &quot;sus7-&gt;dom7&quot;<br/>interplay over the blues reflects this a lot. From a purely perceptual<br/>standpoint, I feel that Thelonious Monk, for example, tended to use<br/>this tempering more to imply ratios of 7 (and 19), and other post-bop<br/>composers (such as Wayne Shorter) used it to imply ratios of 5.<br/>- We then saw an even more substantial re-exploration of meantone by<br/>exploring &quot;modal&quot; music and the use of various modes as the basis for<br/>a tonality (what Paul Erlich refers to as &quot;dynamic tonality,&quot; I<br/>believe, although I disagree with his notion that only Dorian and<br/>Mixolydian can display this tendency).<br/>- We then also started to see other rank 2 temperaments consistent<br/>with 12-equal being explored, namely the augmented temperament (as<br/>displayed in Giant Steps) and the diminished temperament (this could<br/>be said to have been explored prior to this with the use of the<br/>octatonic scale as well).<br/>- A nice &quot;ultra-modern&quot; sound is to explore the &quot;#1&quot; interval while<br/>keeping the natural 1 in the scale as well, and although I have no<br/>scientific theory backing this up, I think the equivocation between<br/>this and 17/16 is being taken advantage of at times.

But for you to say that<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re right and everyone else is &quot;wrong&quot; is a bit arrogant and<br/>&gt; &gt; slightly misguided. You aren&apos;t talking about a bunch of deviant<br/>&gt; &gt; children who didn&apos;t learn theory properly. You&apos;re talking about naming<br/>&gt; &gt; conventions that are a century old now, and have evolved from people<br/>&gt; &gt; who most certainly advanced music theory past the older &quot;common<br/>&gt; &gt; practice&quot; norms.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; This is exactly what I doubt.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think you missed my point. My point was that you are insisting that<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-tet is still meantone, and hence that different enharmonically<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalent chords (C E G# vs C E Ab, or C Eb Gb Bbb vs C Eb Gb A) are<br/>&gt; &gt; aurally different. I&apos;m thus asking then if, by the same logic,<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone is really 5-limit JI, and hence chords like C Eb G and C F Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb G are different, and if one of the Eb&apos;s should be notated as Eb+ or<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb\ or something like that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; I was not talking about microtonality or meantone, just about pure<br/>&gt; 12ET. For me is no problem to think in 12ET and use enharmonics. I<br/>&gt; see no problem in it, no contradiction, because I have started my<br/>&gt; formal music education on piano. And because I&apos;m zen-buddhist, for us<br/>&gt; nothing is impossible.

The fact that the fifths are<br/>&gt; significantly flat in both 19/31 is enough to drive me nuts with all<br/>&gt; of my pseudo-hip stacked fifth/fourth voicings, but I could probably<br/>&gt; get used to it. I had a very fruitful conversation with Paul Erlich<br/>&gt; about the intersection of tuning theory and jazz a month ago, and it<br/>&gt; left me believing the following two theses:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) &quot;Jazz,&quot; in the sense of the term being a description of a genre of<br/>&gt; music, is really suited for 12-equal. There are a lot of comma pumps<br/>&gt; and &quot;puns&quot; taken advantage of in 12-equal that don&apos;t exist in other<br/>&gt; temperaments. For example, as you no doubt know, 12-equal (or some<br/>&gt; kind of 12-tone circulating temperament) is the only tuning in which<br/>&gt; meantone, pajara, and dominant are all &quot;modalities,&quot; and their<br/>&gt; importance to jazz is listed, IMO, in that order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Figuring out ii-V-I&apos;s without meantone is basically guaranteed to give<br/>&gt; you nightmares. The other two could probably be worked out a little<br/>&gt; bit more easily. Also, the fact that b9&apos;s and #9&apos;s approximate 17:16<br/>&gt; and 19:16 very well in 12-equal implies some other higher-limit<br/>&gt; temperaments that I&apos;m not sure have names right now. But we should<br/>&gt; give them names.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) &quot;Jazz,&quot; in a more broad, philosophical sense, is more of a<br/>&gt; philosophy that could be &quot;run&quot; on any tuning. Consider the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Historically speaking, after plowing into meantone a bit more than was<br/>&gt; done common practice music (building off of some of the harmonic ideas<br/>&gt; in the late-Romantic era), jazz started to become more about a<br/>&gt; systematic exploration of other rank-2 temperaments consistent with<br/>&gt; 12-equal.<br/>&gt; - The concept of tritone substitution, for example, strongly implies a<br/>&gt; tempering out of 50/49.<br/>&gt; - The use of the blues in 12-tet general could imply an equivocation<br/>&gt; between 19/16 and 6/5 (and 7/6 and 32/27 too (and 75/64 if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; exceptionally clever)).<br/>&gt; - The use of the mixolydian mode in particular to play the blues<br/>&gt; implies a tempering out of 64/63, and all of the &quot;sus7-&gt;dom7&quot;<br/>&gt; interplay over the blues reflects this a lot. From a purely perceptual<br/>&gt; standpoint, I feel that Thelonious Monk, for example, tended to use<br/>&gt; this tempering more to imply ratios of 7 (and 19), and other post-bop<br/>&gt; composers (such as Wayne Shorter) used it to imply ratios of 5.<br/>&gt; - We then saw an even more substantial re-exploration of meantone by<br/>&gt; exploring &quot;modal&quot; music and the use of various modes as the basis for<br/>&gt; a tonality (what Paul Erlich refers to as &quot;dynamic tonality,&quot; I<br/>&gt; believe, although I disagree with his notion that only Dorian and<br/>&gt; Mixolydian can display this tendency).<br/>&gt; - We then also started to see other rank 2 temperaments consistent<br/>&gt; with 12-equal being explored, namely the augmented temperament (as<br/>&gt; displayed in Giant Steps) and the diminished temperament (this could<br/>&gt; be said to have been explored prior to this with the use of the<br/>&gt; octatonic scale as well).<br/>&gt; - A nice &quot;ultra-modern&quot; sound is to explore the &quot;#1&quot; interval while<br/>&gt; keeping the natural 1 in the scale as well, and although I have no<br/>&gt; scientific theory backing this up, I think the equivocation between<br/>&gt; this and 17/16 is being taken advantage of at times. The same applies<br/>&gt; with the #2 and 19/16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not all of these developments are really particular to jazz (Debussy<br/>&gt; and Ravel were screwing around with a lot of these ideas decades<br/>&gt; prior), but the point is: if you gave jazz musicians a 31-tet<br/>&gt; instrument, they&apos;d go nuts. They&apos;d also go nuts with an instrument<br/>&gt; tuned to mavila. I do think equal temperaments are probably going to<br/>&gt; be somewhat important here though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Apr 27, 2010 at 2:40 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now if we &quot;imagine&quot; that from C to F# (say) there can be two F#&apos;s, say another called &quot;Gb&quot;, and detune according to some comma problem that came from elsewhere, then we are destroying this symmetry.

Horn players for eg will tend to spell these out. If we run through all keys in seventh chords, C7 F7 Bb7 etc..., then the tritone between the maj3 and min7 degree of each chord descends chromatically and the maj3 and min7 alternate i.e. 3-7 = E-Bb for C7 becomes 7-3 = Eb-A for F7 etc... And because this interval is the same under inversion, then it is an efficient way of mapping out all keys on the instrument.</p><p>We then modify this basic &apos;scaffolding&apos; to match the chord progression of songs. For eg, in the key of Cmaj we have Cma7 to Fma7 and the guide tones are E-B to E-A. Next, Bm7(b5) to Em (or E7), guide tones D-A to D-G (or G# for E7) and so on.</p><p>I was just wondering how you guys might approach this in other tunings? I tried it in meantone and it sounds good.

Good luck to anyone trying this!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Er, well... yeah. That was the point of the huge tirade above. Give<br/>&gt; jazz people any equal temperament and they&apos;ll go nuts.
