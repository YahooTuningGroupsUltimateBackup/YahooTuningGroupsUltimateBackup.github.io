(but that&apos;s<br/>what the scroll bar is for... :)</p><p>Anton Rovner<br/>The Legacy of Microtonal Music in the 20-th Century<br/>The beginning of the 20th century witnessed the emergence of many<br/>different new musical trends, unprecedented by their radical<br/>innovations and by the fact of the simultaneity of their appearance.<br/>At the time when the diatonic harmony, familiar to us, was being<br/>replaced by the new, chromatic harmony, certain composers did not<br/>content themselves with the simple progression from seven notes to<br/>twelve, but continued in search for new and undiscovered harmonies,<br/>falling outside of the familiar 12-note equal tempered scale. They<br/>discovered for themselves the new realm of complex scales and<br/>temperaments, i.e. what we call microtonality.<br/>One of the first accomplishments of microtonality was the appearance<br/>of the rather &quot;simple&quot; scale  the quarter-tone scal. It essentially<br/>doubles the familiar twelve-note scale, dividing each semitone in<br/>half. Quarter-tone compositions have been written by the classics of<br/>microtonal music, such as Charles Ives (Three Pieces for Two Pianos<br/>in Quarter-Tones), Alois Haba (his String Quartets and opera &quot;Die<br/>Mutter&quot;), Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Mexican composer Julian Carillo and<br/>German composer Richard Stein.  Soon afterwards composers and<br/>theorists turned to new and more complex scales and modes.<br/>Microtonal thinking developed as suddenly and sporadically in<br/>different countries as the many other musical, literary and artistic<br/>innovations of that time. In Germany, the first quarter-tone<br/>composition ever to be published was the Two Pieces for Cello and<br/>Piano by German composer Richard Stein, published in 1906. The famous<br/>pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni in his &quot;Sketch for a New<br/>Esthetic in Music&quot;, a philosophical treatise, calling for the<br/>development new and free forms of musical thinking, advocated the use<br/>of third and sixth tones, to expand our musical perception: He<br/>wrote: &quot;Music was born free; and to win freedom is its destiny. It<br/>will become the most complete of all reflexes of Nature by reason of<br/>its untrammeled immateriality. () all signs presage a revolution,<br/>and a next step toward that &quot;eternal harmony.&quot; Let us once again call<br/>to mind, that in this latter the gradation of the octave is infinite,<br/>and let us strive to draw a little nearer to infinitude.&quot; Busoni did<br/>not write any microtonal music himself, nevertheless his ideas on the<br/>subject were crucial to the further development of microtonality.<br/>In his article &quot;Quarter-tone Music&quot;, published in &quot;Die Musik&quot; in<br/>1923, Richard Stein emphasized the historical significance of the<br/>latest microtonal discoveries: &quot;We, quarter-tone composers, do not in<br/>the least want to impose a new system of composition, as certain<br/>other groups of Neutonerduring the course of many millenia millions<br/>of people expressed their highest forms of happiness and the most<br/>profound sorrows in more or less artistically constructed music,<br/>without using our sound-system, utilized by us during the last two-<br/>hundred years&quot;.<br/>Early 20th century Russia had witnessed a flourishing of innovation<br/>in music and the arts. A number of composers and theorists turned to<br/>expanding the realm of pitch. Alexander Scriabin, though having never<br/>actually applied microtonality to his music, has thought about it<br/>extensively, in his strivings to expand and merge together all forms<br/>of art into his cosmic mega-composition, the &quot;Mysterium,&quot; which he<br/>has never lived to complete. As witnessed by his biographer, composer<br/>and music critic, Leonid Sabaneyev, Scriabin dreamed of expanding the<br/>12-note equal temperament, in order to utilize in the &quot;Mysterium,&quot;<br/>more complex and refined pitches, falling outside of the standard<br/>temperament.<br/>In his book &quot;Remembrances of Scriabin&quot; Sabaneyev has cited the<br/>following quotations from Scriabin: &quot;By now I already have a certain<br/>feeling that these harmonies do not fit into this temperament. I need<br/>to invent some kinds of signs for these sounds. () Now I feel that<br/>in my harmonies there could result two sounds, for which you couldn&apos;t<br/>find a different indication. For instance, this ninth should be lower<br/>than the standard one and much lower ...&apos; Scriabin was clearly<br/>thinking in terms of harmonies derived from the overtone series. &apos;I<br/>am thinking of indicating with numbers the signs for raising the<br/>pitches, when they cannot be indicated with sharps and flats. For<br/>instance, if I would need the seventh overtone, I would write the<br/>number 7 (...) I feel here, for instance, that this sound () is<br/>higher than G-sharp and lower than A.&quot; Sabaneyev claimed to have<br/>traced the origin of Scriabin&apos;s &quot;mystic chord&quot; of &quot;Prometheus&quot; to the<br/>1st,  5th, 7th, 9th 11th and 13th overtones.<br/>Among some of the other earliest musicians to use microtones,<br/>composer Arthur Lourie wrote a Prelude for piano in quarter-tones in<br/>1915. The music theorist Nicolai Kulbin wrote a pamphlet,<br/>titled &quot;Free music,&quot; published in Wassily Kandinsky&apos;s &quot;Blaue Reiter<br/>Almanac&quot;, where he advocated the use of microtonal intervals to<br/>expand the freedom of musical expression. As he wrote: &quot;The creator<br/>of free music similarly to a nightingale is not limited to tones and<br/>half-tones. He also utilizes quarter-tones, eighth-tones as well as<br/>music with a free choice of tones.&quot;<br/>Sabaneyev, in addition to promoting Scriabin&apos;s music and ideas, had<br/>developed his own ideas on the subject. He claimed that &quot;as a<br/>science.. music is just born&quot; and due to his interest in acoustics,<br/>called for what he called &quot;ultrachromaticism&quot;, which is presently<br/>known to us as &quot;Just Intonation&quot;. He claimed that the 12-note equal<br/>tempered scale is obsolete, and must give way to the new &quot;music of<br/>the future&quot;  ultrachromaticism.  The overtone series was called<br/>the &quot;basic consonant harmony&quot; by him, and in it, he claimed, there<br/>could not be any dissonance, but only degrees of harmonies. He<br/>predicted that ultrachromatic music would use partials, specifically<br/>adapted to the individual scale, which he would call &quot;harmony-<br/>timbres&quot;.  Sabaneyev proposed presenting higher members of the<br/>overtone series in music. At that time, it was an innovative<br/>proposal, since Western music has used only up to the sixth member of<br/>the series in its repertoire. He also lectured on the 53-tone equal-<br/>tempered system, since, as he presumed, it was closest in its<br/>intervallic content to Just Intonation intervals, and at the same<br/>time, unlike the latter, was equipped to modulate from one key to<br/>another.<br/>A very important figure of the time, Arseny Avraamov has written<br/>numerous articles, published in Russian musical periodicals in the<br/>1910&apos;s and 1920&apos;s, where he discussed expansion of the pitch domain<br/>by means of microtonality, as well as other innovative ideas.<br/>Avraamov and Sabaneyev were adversaries, who polemicized with each<br/>other on the pages of musical periodicals. However many of their<br/>initial claims were similar. Avraamov&apos;s approach was that music<br/>should let science predominate over it, in order to help expand its<br/>horizons. His first articles discussed alternate intervallic<br/>measurements, extending beyond 12-note equal temperament. His<br/>approach swayed towards Just Intonation tuning, based on the harmonic<br/>series, as well as Pythagoren tuning. He also advocated expanding the<br/>rhythmic and the timbral domains into a new, futuristic direction.<br/>His articles in the 1920&apos;s advocated the usage of equal temperaments<br/>more complex than the 12-tone scale. His concept of &quot;omnitonality&quot;<br/>embraced wholeheartedly all equal-temperaments. He invented the so-<br/>called &quot;Universal System of Tones,&quot; which was the 48-tone equal<br/>tempered scale, which he claimed could reproduce all folk-song modes,<br/>and would contain many intervals found in Just Intonation and<br/>Pythagorean tunings. He wrote about this in his article &quot;Jenseits von<br/>Temperierung und Tonalitat&quot;, (published in Melos in 1920), where he<br/>also suggested a Just Intonation system, limited to the seventh<br/>harmonic, which would be limited to a single key. American microtonal<br/>composer Joel Mandelbaum suggested that Avraamov&apos;s pitches would fit<br/>into the 41-tone equal tempered scale. This way, similarly to<br/>Sabaneyev&apos;s 53-tone scale, Avraamov tried to connect the concepts of<br/>the Just Intonation scales and more advanced equal-tempered scales.<br/>However, in general, musicians who supported the equal-tempered scale<br/>became predominant over those supporting just intonation, since in<br/>the 1920&apos;s, the Just Intonation scale proved difficult in terms of<br/>tracing intervals, and modulating to other keys, as contemporary<br/>electronic equipment was not available.<br/>In 1923 Georgy Rimsky-Korsakov founded the Petrograd Society for<br/>Quarter-Tones. He was an exponent of strict adherence toward quarter-<br/>tones in music, as he demonstrated in his article &quot;The Basis of the<br/>Quarter-Tone Musical System&quot; for the Russian publication De Musica.<br/>In 1927 he gave the first public demonstration and concert of quarter-<br/>tone music in Moscow. He researched quarter-tone music and conducted<br/>an ensemble for microtonal music until 1932. he also wrote quarter-<br/>tone compositions, some of which used the quarter-tone harmonium and<br/>the Emiriton.<br/>Other achievements of Avraamov include &quot;graphic sound&quot;, i.e.<br/>artificially constructed sound. One of the bases of this discovery<br/>was to go beyond the limits of 12-tone equal tempered scale. In 1930<br/>he began to experiment with generating synthetic sound on the<br/>sountrack of the motion picture film. He was the first to create<br/>artificial sound-recording on film. He used synthetic sound to<br/>preserve folk music, which used non-tempered pitches and intervals.<br/>He saw synthetic music as a means of restoring the natural musical<br/>scale.<br/>Avraamov&apos;s experiments with sound-track movie music paved the way for<br/>another invention  the ANS synthesizer, conceived of by scientist<br/>Evgeny Murzin in 1938 and built by him by 1958. The instrument, the<br/>name of which spells out the initials of Alexander Nikolayevich<br/>Scriabin, was a result of Murzin&apos;s fascination with Scriabin&apos;s music<br/>and ideals. Since Murzin knew that Scriabin sought for means to<br/>extend tonality beyond the 12-note equal-tempered scale, Murzin<br/>devised the instrument, so that it would be able to utilize up to 72-<br/>notes per octave, allowing it to use the quarter-tone scale, the<br/>eighth-tone scale, and Just Intonation intervals. Due to the fact<br/>that it was possible to join each pitch with selected members of the<br/>overtone series of the respective note, certain various instrumental<br/>timbres could also be produced. As a result, pitch change (in terms<br/>of the added harmonic partials) affects timbre  bringing to life<br/>Sabaneyev&apos;s ideas of harmony-timbres.<br/>One of the most important Russian microtonal composers was Ivan<br/>Wyschnegradsky, who together with Alois Haba is considered a founder<br/>of microtonal music composition. His microtonal activity has started<br/>with his immersion into Indian philosophy and mysticism in 1916, and<br/>developing philosophical concepts, similar to Scriabin&apos;s. He composed<br/>a giant symphony for orchestra and reciter, &quot;Le Jour de Brahma&quot;,<br/>which he later revised and renamed &quot;La Journee de l&apos;Existence&quot;.<br/>Similarly to Scriabin and Wagner, the work aimed at achieving a<br/>synthesis of the arts. His first microtonal composition was a piece<br/>for cello and piano, which used two themes from this<br/>symphony: &quot;Meditation on a Theme from the Day of Existence&quot;, which<br/>incorporated quarter-tones and sixth-tones. Most of his music<br/>utilized equal-temperaments, most notably quarter-tones, sixth-tones,<br/>eighth-tones and 1/12 tones. These temperaments were used in<br/>compositions for respectively two, three or four pianos. He also<br/>wrote music for two pianos and violin, two pianos and voice and even<br/>two or more pianos and Ondes Martenot.<br/>Unlike the thorists, Avramov and Sabaneyev, who advocated for the<br/>most complex types of abstract systems, Wyschnegradsky, being one of<br/>the first composers in the domain, sensed the responsibility of<br/>carrying out the task of utilizing the new scales creatively in<br/>practice, and advocated for limitation of the quest for new<br/>temperaments to the accessible. He wrote in his diary in<br/>1919: &quot;Because we, upon receiving this new revelation, immerse<br/>ourselves into the domain of the diminished seventh chord, we acquire<br/>quarter-tones, eighth-tones, sixteenth-tones etc. the limit of which<br/>is  chaos. Here, harsh discipline is necessary, so not to trangress<br/>the boundaries of what can be practically achieved and not to cut<br/>ourselves off from the past. This is why we must limit ourselves to<br/>quarter-tones.&quot;<br/>Only in a small number of his compositions he utilized more complex<br/>scales, such as 31-tones, used in an organ piece written especially<br/>for Adrian Fokker&apos;s 31-tone organ in Holland.<br/>Among Wyschnegradsky&apos;s other innovations were attempts to invent new<br/>means of notation for microtonal music  for instance the 11-lined<br/>staff, designed to notate 1/12 tone music  as well as plans for<br/>pianos with many manuals, fit to perform microtonal music  two-<br/>manual piano for quarter-tones, three-manual for eighth-tones, four-<br/>manual for twelfth-tones. Wyschnegradsky has had piano makers, like,<br/>for instance, Pleyel in Paris and Grotrian-Steinweg in Germany build<br/>such pianos for him.<br/>He did examine, at least passingly, Sabaneyev&apos;s ideas of music based<br/>on the intervallic structure of the overtone series. &quot;If we would<br/>assume that Sabaneyev was right in that Scriabin&apos;s Prometheus chord<br/>could be traced to the higher overtones, the question arises <br/>whether quarter-tone of music is the result of the mastery of the<br/>further series of overtones  from the 16th to the 32nd.&quot;<br/>Wyschnegradsky published a number of treatises on microtonal music,<br/>among which the most famous is the &quot;Manuel d&apos;harmonie des quarts de<br/>ton&quot;. Another one is &quot;La loi de la pansonorite&quot;, published for the<br/>first time in 1996 by the Wyschnegradsky Society in Paris.<br/>Wyschnegradsky developed many interesting ideas related to the<br/>expansion of the sound domain. Among these are his ideas<br/>of &quot;pansonority&quot;, the innate substance beyond music, lying at tis<br/>basis, ideas of &quot;cyclical harmonies&quot;, which are microtonal versions<br/>of the circle of fifths, ideas of rhythmic acceleration (similar to<br/>Elliott Carter&apos;s rhythmic modulation), as well as ideas of color<br/>notation, transfering the Scriabinesque ideas to the microtonal<br/>realm. In Wyschnegradsky&apos;s version, each interval corresponds to a<br/>color. The half-tone is red, the 1/12-tone is orange, the 1/6-tone<br/>yellow, the &frac14;-tone is green, the 1/3 tone is blue and the 5/12 tone<br/>is violet.<br/>Curiously enough, at the height of the Stalin years, there was one<br/>music theorist, who advocated microtonality and alternate tunings.<br/>Alexei Ogolevets examined historical tunings in his two<br/>books &quot;Foundations of Harmonic Language&quot;, published in 1941<br/>and &quot;Introduction to Contemporary Musical Thought,&quot; published in<br/>1946. The books discussed Pythagorean tunings, Just Intonation, as<br/>well as expanded tonal systems, including 17 and 22 tone equal<br/>scales. They were the most thorough and advanced books of the kind in<br/>the Soviet Union. In the latter book, Ogolevets suggested dividing<br/>music history into four periods, while the present time being a<br/>period of transition between the third and the fourth epochs. The<br/>third era marked the predominance of a single system, the 12-note<br/>equal tempered scale, while the fourth era would mark the appearance<br/>of more complex systems, among which would be the 17 and 22 tone<br/>scales.<br/>Europe and America also witnessed a flourishing of microtonal<br/>composers and theorists. Russian-born American theorist Joseph Yasser<br/>in his book &quot;A Theory of Evolving Tonality&quot; came up with an original<br/>theory of the evolution of musical temperament by means of adding to<br/>the number of the notes of the current temperament the number of<br/>notes of the previous, outmoded temperament. According to his theory,<br/>tonality evolves from the five-note scale (pentatonicism), through<br/>the seven-note scale (diatonicism) and the twelve-note scale<br/>(chromaticism) towards the 19-tone scale (microtonality), which in<br/>turn will evolve in future centuries towards the 31-tone and the 50-<br/>tone scales, strictly following the mathematical progression.<br/>The famous Dutch organist and theorist, Adrian Fokker invented the 31-<br/>tone organ, for which many composers had written, including<br/>Wyschnegradsky. Towards the middle of the century, composers like<br/>Haba, Wyschnegradsky, Carillo and others did not content themselves<br/>with simple microtonal scales like quarter-tones or sixth-tones, but<br/>started to incorporate much more advanced and irregular scales. In<br/>the USA towards the middle of the century new outstanding musicians<br/>appeared, such as Mordecai Sandberg, Ivor Darreg and Harry Partch,<br/>whose musical compositions and theoretical concepts expand beyond the<br/>scope of not only &quot;simple&quot; microtonal scales towards more complex<br/>scales, but beyond the realm of traditional instrumental thinking<br/>altogether. This is especially true of Harry Partch, who invented<br/>exotic instruments and whose musical aesthetics is filled with new<br/>sound worlds, among which are the music of Asian countries as well as<br/>the usage of non-musical objects  tin cans and wooden sticks  in<br/>the role of musical instruments.<br/>The new generation of European post-war avant-garde composers also<br/>frequently turned to microtonality and alternate tunings in their<br/>quest for unprecedented new sound material. Karlheinz Stockhausen<br/>used microtones in his first electronic compositions. His Studie II<br/>from 1954 was the first to use the non-octave scale 25th root of<br/>five  the ratio of 5:1 divided into 25 equal parts (making up 10.767<br/>tones to the octaves). Pierre Boulez incorporated microtones in his<br/>early cantata from the 1940&apos;s, &quot;Le Visage Nuptiel&quot; as well as in his<br/>electronic composition from the 1950&apos;s, Polyphonie X. Extensive<br/>microtonal writing is present in the works of Iannis Xenakis, most<br/>notably in his chamber composition &quot;Anaktoria&quot;. Quarter-tones were<br/>used passingly for coloristic effects in the works of Ligeti and<br/>Lutoslawski. The adherents of the contemporary French Spectral<br/>school, Tristan Murail and Gerard Grisey, in their pursuit of hidden<br/>sonorities, present in each tone, played by different instruments,<br/>extract harmonic blocks from these tones, which utilize quarter-<br/>tones, eighth-tones and sixteenth-tones. Subsequently, these<br/>harmonies are applied to their compositions.<br/>Among the many developments in microtonality from the beginning of<br/>the 20th century was the revitalization of different temperaments,<br/>which existed prior to the ascendency of equal temperament  first of<br/>all, Pythagorean tuning, which is based on perfect fifths (implying<br/>raised sharps and lowered flats), as well as the Just Intonation,<br/>developed by musicians since the time of Zarlino in the 16th century,<br/>based on the overtone series (and, consequently, having lowered<br/>sharps and raised flats), the mean-tone temperament and a number of<br/>others. Many composers saw a greater advantage in these organic,<br/>asymetrical constructions, for the most part derived from nature,<br/>over the more &quot;artificial&quot; equal-tempered scales. Despite their<br/>historically remote origins, these &quot;natural scales&quot; are perfectly<br/>viable for usage in a modernist and avant-gardist musical context for<br/>composition of music.<br/>Presently, the microtonal trend in music has obtained a large<br/>quantity of adherents in Europe and in America. In Europe the search<br/>for new timbral effects presume the usage of unstandard temperaments,<br/>which is why quarter-tones and other, more complex microtones have<br/>become standard. In America two camps of microtonal composers exist <br/>those who favor equal temperaments and those who favor historically<br/>generated temperaments. With modern computer technology it is<br/>possible to make the latter tunings more pliable and flexible by<br/>transposing and altering them. Among the contemporary American<br/>composers, who write microtonal music, one could name Johnny<br/>Reinhard, Joseph Pehrson, Joel Mandelbaum, Neil Drummond, Robert<br/>Priest and a host of others. Among the contemporary music ensembles<br/>and festivals, devoted to microtonal music, there is the American<br/>Festival of Microtonal Music in New York, Microfest in California and<br/>a host of others.<br/>There is a new concept of microtonality, labeled by composer Johnny<br/>Reinhard as &quot;polymicrotonality&quot;, i.e. the usage of several different<br/>microtonal temperaments in one composition, not limiting oneself to<br/>the constraints of any one temperament. These contrasting trends in<br/>the realm of microtonality create a rich and diverse musical context.<br/>After a hiatus of many decades, microtonal music is currently making<br/>a return to Russia. Starting from the 1960&apos;s and 1970&apos;s the emerging<br/>Russian avant-gardists, Alfred Schnittke, Edison Denisov and Sophia<br/>Gubaidulina have used quarter-tones in a number of important<br/>compositions of theirs. At the beginning of the 1960&apos;s the<br/>aforementioned ANS synthesizer, the first electronic instrument in<br/>the Soviet Union, was placed in the Scriabin Museum in Moscow the<br/>became available to young composers. Schnittke, Denisov, Gubaidulina,<br/>Eduard Artemiev, Andrei Volkonsky and a host of others, made use of<br/>it to compose electronic compositions, some of which used at least to<br/>a small degree the different microtonal temperaments, available on<br/>the instrument. Separate pieces of more traditional composers like<br/>Sergei Slonimsky have used the cent system devised by Alexander Ellis.<br/>The latest big event in the realm of microtonal music in Russia was a<br/>concert on November 7, 2001 at the Composers&apos; Union Building in<br/>Moscow, which featured compositions for two pianos tuned a quarter-<br/>tone apart. The program featured Charles Ives&apos; &quot;Three Compositions<br/>for Two Pianos&quot;, Ivan Wyschnegradsky&apos;s &quot;Integrations&quot; (a late work<br/>from 1967),  &quot;Cabinet in Quarter-tones&quot; by Swiss composer Roland<br/>Moser, and quarter-tone compositions by three contemporary Moscow<br/>composers, &quot;4 x 4 for direct and reflected sounds&quot; by Igor<br/>Kefalidi, &quot;Several Border-line Conditions&quot; by Sergei Pavlenko<br/>and &quot;Vers Libre&quot; by Victor Ekimovsky. This concert presented itself<br/>as an important step towards the reestablishment in Russia of the<br/>tradition of microtonal music, which had existed there in the early<br/>20th century.</p><p>Bibliography<br/>Avraamov, Arseny &quot;Jenseits von Temperierung und Tonalitat&quot;, published<br/>in Melos, Vol. 1, 1920, p.131.<br/>Avraamov, Arseny, &quot;The Emerging Musical Science and a New Era of<br/>Music History&quot; Muzykal&apos;ny Sovremennik, St. Petersburg, N.6, 1916<br/>Kulbin, Nicolai, &quot;Free Music&quot;, published in Der Blaue Reiter, Berlin,<br/>1911<br/>Busoni, Ferruccio, Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music, published in,<br/>Three Classics in the Aesthetic of Music, Dover Publications, Inc.<br/>New York<br/>Kreichi, Stanislav, &quot;ANS continues to work&quot;, Muzykal&apos;naya Akademiya,<br/>N.4, 1999.<br/>McLaren, Brian, A Brief History of Microtonality in the Twentieth<br/>Century<br/>Ogolevets, Alexei, Introduction to Contemporary Musical Thought,<br/>Muzgiz, Moscow-Leningrad, 1946<br/>Sabaneyev, Leonid, Remembrances of Scriabin, Moscow, 2000<br/>Stein, Richard, &quot;Quarter-tone Music&quot;, published in &quot;Die Musik&quot;, 1923,<br/>reprinted in &quot;K Novym beregam&quot;, Moscow, 1923, N.3, p.6-15<br/>Wyschnegradsky, Ivan, The Pyramid of Life, diaries,<br/>Moscow, &quot;Kompozitor&quot;, 2001.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2003 3:15:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Anton Rovner just wrote an interesting article tracing the history<br/>of<br/>&gt; microtonality in Russia (and elsewhere).
