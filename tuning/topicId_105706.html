[I probably chould have chosen an 13 limit one]<br/>all papers discussed below are included in this pdf,<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/Al-FarabiTetrachord.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/Al-FarabiTetrachord.pdf</a><br/>which will be added to in the future upon time permitting.<br/>The tetrachord chosen is just for the sake of example and to show how we might depart in a few directions for any single point. I feel it is an important question in that we often present scales here but not how to go from one to the other.</p><p>While on the subject of some interesting Tetrachordal scales i thought i would expand it to talk about what one can do with one as far as permutations and modulations. While we might be content to stay in one, even the ancients found great musical use in extending it. Ptolemy associated modulations with &quot;crisis&quot; and we like most ages, flatter ourselves with placing  ourselves in what appears to be on the brink of the biggest ones in history. The music of the previous century because of the proliferation of the entire array of the resources of the tuning at hand suppressed modulation.  At best when it occured it became more a manner of transposition marking the lack of any real significant change in meaning in the music.<br/>first let us look at the rotation of the tetrachords and one useful way of viewing them.</p><p><a href="http://anaphoria.com/Al-FarabiTetrachord.jpg">http://anaphoria.com/Al-FarabiTetrachord.jpg</a></p><p>This shows how the structure of the triadic diamond can be applied to melodic structures as easily as harmonic ones. Considering the Diamond - Lambdoma Equivalence and it found in Greece where there was no harmony on might expect this use of the structure to be even more common than the  harmonic.</p><p><a href="http://anaphoria.com/Al-FarabiRotations.jpg">http://anaphoria.com/Al-FarabiRotations.jpg</a><br/>Shows as an example of modulating by rotating the positions of two intervals in this case in a cycle of what resembles a cycle of variable &quot;fourths&quot; or applying it every third step of a heptatonic scale at a time.  .<br/>The advantage to this is that one is only changing one note at a time and offers the option of these tones to be used just like accidentals are within say a diatonic scale.<br/>This also goes through some mixed tetrachords albeit only three of the possible six but the previous diagram can be used as the basis of such a link if one insist on it.</p><p>There is an advantage to knowing the most closely related material first, keeping in mind that it is in no way meant as a rule or restriction. Musically we often need to progress more abruptly, hence we can skip how we want. The two extreme scales omitting the gray one  are transposed versions of each <a href="http://other.It">other.It</a> is as if the scale as drifted with offers us musical possibilities. for instance one might start and suddenly jump to this new key then slowly modulate back one tone at a time until we find ourselves where we started.</p><p><a href="http://anaphoria.com/PurviAl-Farabi.jpg">http://anaphoria.com/PurviAl-Farabi.jpg</a> &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/PurviAl-Farabi.jpg">http://anaphoria.com/PurviAl-Farabi.jpg</a>&gt;<br/>This one uses Wilson&apos;s Purvi modulation since it came up recently i thought it worth showing this example.<br/>It is similar to the one before except in between the recurrence of the same scale we find ourselves with some new intervals. These scales are of interest in that they involve as many as 5 diffent ratios in a heptatonic scale. I should point out this is not the only Purvi Permutation of this scale. The 7/5, 45/32, or even one of the 4/3 could be used to act as the closing fourth so there would be potentially 7 different direction we could take off this singular Tetrachordal scale.</p><p>There is also the possibilities of the Marwa Permutations, of which the options are even greater but these will have to wait till the future.</p><p>--<br/>signature file</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div><h3><a id=105708 href="#105708">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2012 8:08:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraiggrady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>Purvi<br/>&gt; Permutation</p><p>Marwa Permutations</p><p>Can anyone explicitly and rigorously define these for me, using words only, NO pictures?</p></div><h3><a id=105710 href="#105710">ðŸ”—</a>Brofessor &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2012 1:36:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Gene~<br/> This is a possible over simple  version but i hope will work well.I will have to say it is a challenge in that for any type of permutation, it seem simplier to illustrate the sequence.<br/> but here it goes.</p><p>The archetypal model of the Marwa permutations takes a 7 tone tetrachordal scale and then spells it as a chain of &grave;fourths&apos; that very often will vary in size.

For example, from Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>22:12-12:11-7:6, we get 88:81-12:11-9:8 (143-151-204<br/>cents), a permutation of al-Farabi&apos;s 9:8-12:11-88:81<br/>which could be a modern Arab Bayyati tetrachord.</p><p>The closest analogy I can come up with to this method<br/>is Safi al-Din al-Urmawi in the middle to late 13th<br/>century and his method of trying out various tetrachord<br/>and pentachord combinations. We get all kinds of modes,<br/>some of the usual maqamat, and some which evidently<br/>aren&apos;t, at least _yet_, but certainly make for<br/>interesting music.</p><p>As the article discuss, these methods of tetrachord<br/>or modal variation were evidently developed in<br/>connection with the raga system. An especially<br/>fascinating instance involves the permutations or<br/>modulations of the Diatonic of Archytas at<br/>28:27-8:7-9:8, including Raga Darbari Kanada,<br/>9:8-28:27-8:7-9:8-28:27-8:7-9:8. An interesting<br/>question is whether this division came by way of<br/>Persia, since I&apos;ve read that &quot;Darbari Kanada&quot; might<br/>mean &quot;Kanada of the (Persian) Court&quot; or the like.</p><p>However, Erv Wilson&apos;s examples using ancient Greek<br/>tetrachords and more recent tunings from Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger, for example, show that the method<br/>is relevant to raga and many other musics as well.</p><p>In sum, these are _very_ impressive ways of<br/>generating new genera and modes.</p><p>Happy New Year,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105725 href="#105725">ðŸ”—</a>kraiggrady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2012 11:03:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Gene~<br/>    Purvi is fortunately a little more straight forward.<br/> Once again we have a closing fourth which remain constant and at the end of our cycle of fourths spelling of our tetrachordal scale. The other 6 &apos;fourths&apos; are placed in order and rotated by taking the first one and placing it at the end of the sequence of these 6 and one repeats this till one comes back to the beginning. It is worth noting that both of these patterns are more spiral like than cyclical in that when one returns to the scale one started with one is in a quite different key.<br/> Know your preferences towards ETs . One can still apply such patterns using number of scale steps over ratios, albeit one would need a medium to large enough number of tones for it to be distinctful.<br/>--<br/>signature file</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div><h3><a id=105726 href="#105726">ðŸ”—</a>kraiggrady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2012 12:00:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Margo~<br/> I am glad you find these scales useful also.</p><p>There is a variation on these i came up by accident. which i will call modified Purvi.</p><p>Being stuck in a library at a time i hadn&apos;t studied it in  detail and trying to recall it from memory I changed what appears on page 2 on the purvi article.&lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/xen10pur.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/xen10pur.PDF</a> &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/xen10pur.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/xen10pur.PDF</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>I will express this also in a form Gene requested of the others so he needn&apos;t request it.</p><p>One takes the entire chain of &quot;fourths&quot; found in our tetrachordal scale and starting at the beginning one exchanges it with the one following.

I would see this in the same fascination certain people like Walter O&apos;Connell did with those 4 note sequences in 12 that give one all interval sets, but of which Dave Keenan pointed out work better in 13. Wilson too mapped out such 6 note all interval sets in 31 ET. But perhaps i am placing more importance on a technical aspect of like scales, still it is nice to have a tool to access them and be what will.</p><p>The subject of Raga Darbari Kanada came up in a private conversation with Cris Forster and as we found out is quite an abnormality in Rage scales, being a much later additions as we discovered.<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbari_Kanada">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbari_Kanada</a></p><p>I will say despite the many years when i  heard a 28/27 in like scale, i still succumb to it beauty.

And one of the interesting<br/>aspects, as I discuss below, is exploring some of the things that<br/>are getting compromised in a &quot;near-just&quot; system. It&apos;s a bit like<br/>those tests for different forms of color blindness, where we find<br/>that a comma has been tempered out, although others may be<br/>observed so that we still have a lot of step sizes in a<br/>heptatonic mode.</p><p>&gt;  One could apply this to this to an ET or even a Constant structure<br/>&gt;  in which case we can think of it being the difference between a<br/>&gt;  real modulation and what is called a tonal modulation. The latter<br/>&gt;  can be awkward at times , but often will give us new patterns in a<br/>&gt;  tuning we might already have and love.</p><p>Please remind me on the distinction between real and tonal<br/>modulation. I recall something like this in counterpoint theory<br/>distinguishing between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;tonal&quot; imitation -- maybe it<br/>was &quot;real answer&quot; and &quot;tonal answer.&quot; But I&apos;d like to understand<br/>your meaning as it relates to modulation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;        &quot;For example, from Ptolemy&apos;s 22:12-12:11-7:6, [my<br/>&gt;&gt;   mistake, 22:21 not 22:12 -- M.S.] we get 88:81-12:11-9:8<br/>&gt;&gt;   (143-151-204 cents), a permutation of al-Farabi&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;   9:8-12:11-88:81 which could be a modern Arab Bayyati<br/>&gt;&gt;   tetrachord.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  I would just like to comment that some of these scales will result<br/>&gt;  in as many as 5 different size steps in our scale which is quite<br/>&gt;  unusual and hard to have a good theoretical way to explore.</p><p>The curious thing is that 5 step sizes may not be so unusual in<br/>some of the maqam tunings which often use diverse ajnas<br/>(genera). To take a relatively &quot;garden variety&quot; example, here&apos;s a<br/>version of Makam Suznak, using some of Ptolemy&apos;s ratios, see<br/>Erv&apos;s Purvi modulations, p. 7, Fig. 8a, mode 3. Here I&apos;ll give<br/>the just values and the tempered values in MET-24.</p><p>   207.4  150.0   139.5  207.4   150.0   264.8   80.9<br/>   203.9  150.6   143.5  203.9   150.6   266.9   80.5<br/>    9:8   12:11   88:81   9:8    12:11    7:6    22:21<br/> 1/1    9/8   27/22   4/3     3/2    18/11    21/11  2/1<br/>  0    203.9  354.5  498.0   702.0   852.6   1119.5 1200<br/>  0    207.4  357.4  496.9   704.3   854.3   1119.1 1200<br/>  |--------------------|.......|----------------------|<br/>           Rast          tone            Hijaz</p><p>In either JI or MET-24 we get 5 different step sizes. But another<br/>of Erv&apos;s modulations, Fig. 8a, mode 4, will show that MET-24 is<br/>indeed not quite JI when it comes to observing these<br/>distinctions:</p><p>   207.4   207.4    82.0  207.4  150.0   264.8   80.9<br/>   203.9   213.6    80.5  203.9  150.6   266.9   80.5<br/>    9:8   112:99   22:21   9:8   12:11    7:6    22:21<br/> 1/1    9/8    14/11  4/3     3/2    18/11    21/11  2/1<br/>  0    203.9   417.5 498.0   702.0   852.6   1119.5 1200<br/>  0    207.4   414.8 496.9   704.3   854.3   1119.1 1200<br/>  |--------------------|.......|----------------------|<br/>           &grave;Ajam         tone            Hijaz</p><p>Again, the JI version has 5 step sizes. In MET-24, however, we<br/>only get 4, because 9:8 and 112:99 are both represented as 207.4<br/>cents. This is actually a tad closer to a just 9/8 than 12n-EDO,<br/>but not very close to 112:99 at 896:891 larger, one of the commas<br/>(an undecimal kleisma) tempered out in MET-24. Curiously, we<br/>could say that the two tempered steps of 207.4 cents might most<br/>accurately represent 44:39 (208.835 cents) and 273:242 (208.673<br/>cents), thus tempering out the 10648/10647!

In an ET it will make not difference unless we we are working with a subset. With say a large constant structure, lets say treating the Partch fabric as a 41 tone structure with two addition, the transposition of the same number of steps throughout the tuning will result in different ratios but all within a certain range of variability.

Perhaps a better term might be commatic transposition for instead of tempering out commas the constant structure chooses one or the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;        &quot;For example, from Ptolemy&apos;s 22:12-12:11-7:6, [my<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;   mistake, 22:21 not 22:12 -- M.S.] we get 88:81-12:11-9:8<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;   (143-151-204 cents), a permutation of al-Farabi&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;   9:8-12:11-88:81 which could be a modern Arab Bayyati<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;   tetrachord.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The curious thing is that 5 step sizes may not be so unusual in<br/>&gt; some of the maqam tunings which often use diverse ajnas<br/>&gt; (genera). To take a relatively &quot;garden variety&quot; example, here&apos;s a<br/>&gt; version of Makam Suznak, using some of Ptolemy&apos;s ratios, see<br/>&gt; Erv&apos;s Purvi modulations, p. 7, Fig. 8a, mode 3.</p><p>Thank you for pointing out that a heptatonic with 5 different sizes is not as uncommon as i was implying.

There is much to be said about mixed tetrachords in regard to repeating ones. While the latter will have more simple ratios of 4/3 and 3/2 ,It is the lack of them in most places outside the tonic or tonal center of our scale in the former that helps keep the scale centered in the mode being played.</p><p>&gt; So one theoretical way to explore might be to sing or play<br/>&gt; through the permutations or modulations, and see if they line up<br/>&gt; with recognized maqamat, say -- or how they fill in some of the<br/>&gt; gaps in the recognized forms.

Here it is possible to divide a 2/1 octave into<br/>17 unequal thirdtones with sizes of 57.4; 68.0 or 69.1; and 80.9<br/>or 82.0 cents.

One criterion for a good mode, at least in<br/>theory, was the degree of &quot;consonance&quot; -- basically, the number of<br/>3/2 and 4/3 intervals you could find. However, asymmetrical<br/>tetrachords are clearly also highly prized.</p><p>&gt;  Erv was one to always draw upon traditional sources for the the<br/>&gt;  development of new material, usually but simple steps not out<br/>&gt;  of place in possibility from the source. It is not much<br/>&gt;  different how the Persians did with the Greek scales<br/>&gt;  themselves. We might say our approach is more of a going deeper<br/>&gt;  into what already exist as opposed to outside of it.</p><p>The way that the Marwa permutations or Purvi modulations with a<br/>Greek genus like 22:21-12:11-7:6 lead to divisions like the<br/>9:8-12:11-88:81 of al-Farabi is really intriguing -- with the<br/>Persian theorists you discuss of course relevant also.</p><p>What Safi al-Din does, for example, is, at a level of tetrachords,<br/>to urge that all six permutations be studied. At a level of<br/>&quot;cycles&quot; or octave modes, he lists the possible pairings of seven<br/>lower tetrachords with 12 upper pentachords, or 84 modes at all,<br/>noting those most important or favored. So the kinds of techniques<br/>we&apos;re discussing could be considered indeed &quot;going deeper&quot; into<br/>historical approaches.</p><p>&gt; Also i would say we are less interested in creating &quot;schism&quot;<br/>&gt; with the past or with other cultures. On the other hand much has<br/>&gt; happened around the world, in the west and elsewhere that has<br/>&gt; broaden our musical expression as I will not surrender how these<br/>&gt; have enriched our disposition with all due respect to the past.</p><p>Actually the Anaphorian approach, if I may call it that, could be<br/>quite in keeping with aspects of the Maqam or Dastgah tradition<br/>(the latter really a specific Persian development in fairly recent<br/>times of the former). In Ottoman circles, for example, I have<br/>heard that there were awards offered to a musician who could<br/>arrive at a pleasing new maqam, with various maqamat attributed to<br/>great composers who thus set precedents for later usage.</p><p>What sometimes happens with the Marwa permutations or Purvi<br/>modulations is that, among various easily recognizable maqamat, I<br/>see something &quot;new&quot; -- which, in at least one instance, turned out<br/>to be in fact a recognized maqam!</p><p>&gt; They each stand with an ability to speak and alternate in their<br/>&gt; influence in a way we might follow forward, knowing we cannot<br/>&gt; and should not go back.</p><p>Of course it is impossible to &quot;go back&quot; by uninventing<br/>developments in practice and theory, but happily possible to seek<br/>some reconciliation of the new and old.</p><p>With best New Year&apos;s wishes,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
