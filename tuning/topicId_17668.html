As many of you know, this is an important side of<br/>his writing, and it is oftentimes not featured as much as it should<br/>be.</p><p>We intend to do something about that!</p><p>Hope to see you at our concert.  A reception at Miller will follow.</p><p>Tickets $17.00 at the Miller Theatre box office:  212-854-7799</p><p>_____________ _______ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
