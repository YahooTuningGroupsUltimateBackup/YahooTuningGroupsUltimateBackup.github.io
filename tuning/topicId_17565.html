In ancient times it<br/>&gt;had been discovered that there was a certain<br/>&gt;psychological &quot;resonance&quot; aroused in listeners when<br/>&gt;sounds produced on otherwise identical strings having<br/>&gt;length ratios 2:1 or 3:2 and compound ratios derived<br/>&gt;from these ratios were heard.  Then by the 16th<br/>&gt;century ratios of 5 in string lengths were recognized<br/>&gt;as being significant in musical harmony (Zarlino).  Until the<br/>&gt;17th century, when the overtones were discovered by<br/>&gt;Galileo and Mersenne, it was believed that somehow<br/>&gt;the numbers themselves had been assigned a mystical<br/>&gt;importance by the Creator.  After the discovery of<br/>&gt;the overtones, it was realized that there were physically<br/>&gt;unique properties - not always completely understood -<br/>&gt;possessed by pairs of sounds having small integer frequency<br/>&gt;ratios one to another.</p><p>So far, we are in complete agreement.</p><p>&gt;In a &quot;Dictionary of the Arts...&quot;<br/>&gt;quoted from in Jorgenson which had been published in<br/>&gt;1764, the author states that in the quarter comma<br/>&gt;mean tone temperament, which he speaks of as the common<br/>&gt;or vulgar temperament, there are small departures from<br/>&gt;the true frequency ratios for the fifth, the minor<br/>&gt;third, and the diatonic 16/15 and chromatic 25/24<br/>&gt;semitones of 1/4 comma or in modern terms, about 5.4<br/>&gt;cents.  He states that although these departures from<br/>&gt;the just ratios can be clearly heard, they do not<br/>&gt;impair the quality of the music performed in this tuning<br/>&gt;system.</p><p>Here it must be noted that any theorist who actually bothered to _listen_ to<br/>these ratios (as Partch is fond of pointing out) would notice that the fifth<br/>and minor third would sound more &quot;locked&quot; in just intonation than in<br/>1/4-comma meantone, while there would be no qualitative difference whatsover<br/>between the diatonic and chromatic semitones in meantone on the one hand,<br/>and in just intonation on the other -- only a quantitative difference in the<br/>rate of beating caused by the deviation from 1:1 itself.</p><p>&gt;The UCSD music library has quite a few 19th<br/>&gt;century musical tomes and they usually have rather<br/>&gt;elaborate schemes of integer frequency ratios depicted<br/>&gt;in articles on musical harmony and intonation - some<br/>&gt;are in languages which I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>Many of the more elaborate schemes of frequency ratios can be considered<br/>worthless for the reasons above and below.</p><p>&gt;I may be being misunderstood as to what I mean by music<br/>&gt;in just intonation.  I mean music in which the notes are<br/>&gt;produced at pitches called for by the harmonies being<br/>&gt;sounded.  A 12 per octave keyboard tuned in a &quot;just intonation&quot;<br/>&gt;scheme can only produce a limited number of harmonies where<br/>&gt;the frequencies of all the notes are in just intonation.<br/>&gt;If one tries to play many other chords as if the keyboard<br/>&gt;were in equal temperament, one will sound many dissonant<br/>&gt;chords so that the result would not be very harmonious and<br/>&gt;it certainly wouldn&apos;t be in just intonation, although there<br/>&gt;have been people who have done just that in order to<br/>&gt;demonstrate how terrible just intonation sounds!  Such a<br/>&gt;&quot;demonstration&quot; could be presented very convincingly, but<br/>&gt;it would be deceptive.</p><p>No, that is not the type of just intonation I was talking about. I was<br/>talking about the type of just intonation for which 53-tone keyboards were<br/>devised in the 19th century. The problem with this type of just intonation<br/>is that the structural syntonic comma, an interval clearly assumed<br/>melodically inaudible by Western composers since 1500 (see Mathieu, _The<br/>Harmonic Experience_, and Blackwood, _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic<br/>Tunings_), becomes audibly large -- and virtually any substantial piece of<br/>Western music since 1500 would require arbitrary judgments on the part of<br/>the &quot;arranger&quot; as to what to do with the comma -- either shifts or drift<br/>would have to result. Such renditions ultimately offend the musical ear; the<br/>term &quot;slimy&quot; is one I recall from the New Grove Dictionary. By the time of<br/>Beethoven even extended meantone is insufficient to capture all the<br/>equivalencies assumed in the music -- other commas such as the diesis and<br/>diaschisma make a closed system of 12 (within melodic discrimination)<br/>pitches indispensable for the music.</p><p>Now, that is not to say that meantone temperament isn&apos;t ultimately derived<br/>from an ideal of just intonation in vertical sonorities. It is, with the<br/>additional constraint of syntonic comma equivalency. But meantone<br/>temperament is not the only way to reconcile these desiderata. Vicentino&apos;s<br/>second tuning of 1555 does so as well, by using pure JI sonorities for<br/>vertical triads but forming these from _two_ 1/4-comma meantone chains tuned<br/>1/4 comma apart. Thus any comma shifts are restricted to 1/4 comma in size,<br/>melodically unobjectionable as a unison. John deLaubenfels&apos; current adaptive<br/>tuning work takes this idea a step further, ideally allowing any piece<br/>written in any tuning system (for now only 12-tone ones) to approach JI in<br/>its verticalities while eliminating any comma-like melodic shifts or pitch<br/>drifts. Both approaches, however, would have been impracticable on an<br/>actual, human-operated keyboard without computerized gadgetry, so would have<br/>been of relatively little interest, as compared with meantone, in writings<br/>of past theorists. Theorists, that is, who went beyond elaborate schemes of<br/>frequency ratios and saw the full musical implications of tuning systems --<br/>theorists like Woolhouse, for example.</p><p>Getting back to the original point, any composer from Monteverdi to Mahler<br/>might think of G# and Ab as two different notes, but would think of D as D,<br/>a single pitch, not a comma higher here, a comma lower there. Western<br/>musical reality until the early 20th century had, at its center, the<br/>diatonic scale, the scale of all known music in that world and the basis of<br/>its notation. Elaborate schemes of frequency ratios may have profligated at<br/>the periphery, but for any Western musician actually making music, there was<br/>only one size of whole tone; modulating to the dominant meant only one note<br/>changed, not two; and progressions like I-vi-ii-V-I and I-IV-ii-V-I had no<br/>small shifts of sustained pitches, nor overall drifts of pitch level. Though<br/>such curiosities may have been ackowledged in theory by otherwise<br/>knowledgable theorists like Rameau and Zarlino, they played no part in the<br/>historically important music of their era or of any other in our history.</p></div>
