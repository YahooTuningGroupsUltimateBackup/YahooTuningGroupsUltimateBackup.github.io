Meantone leading tones are larger,<br/>&gt; but at 66.6 cents, thirdtones are larger still.</p><p>Hello, there, and I suspect that you may actually be discussing intervals<br/>of 2/3-tone, as occur in the Renaissance temperament of 1/3-comma meantone<br/>with pure minor thirds (Salinas), or in the almost exactly equivalent of<br/>19-tone equal temperament (19-tet) as discussed in the same era by<br/>Costeley.</p><p>Under such a system, the size of the whole-tone itself is somewhat<br/>_smaller_ than the 200 cents of 12-tet; and in meantone, the diatonic<br/>semitone (e.g. E-F or B-C) is equal in these tunings to a 2/3-tone, or two<br/>19-tet steps. The chromatic semitone, e.g. F-F# or Bb-B, is equal to the<br/>very narrow 1/3-tone of about 63.15 cents, as I recall, for 19-tet, close<br/>to 28:27 (1/3-comma meantone would be very close to this).</p><p>Thus the diatonic semitone of 2/3-tone in 19-tet is equal to about 126.3<br/>cents, indeed larger than in 1/4-comma meantone, where it is about 117.1<br/>cents, or tertian just intonation, where it is 16:15 (a bit less than 112<br/>cents).</p><p>For _narrow_ semitones smaller than 12-tet (100 cents) one might go to<br/>Pythagorean, which offers a nice compact diatonic semitone of 256:243<br/>(around 90.22 cents). This is probably the narrowest diatonic semitone<br/>used in an historical Western European tuning, and it nicely fits<br/>medieval chant and polyphony.</p><p>However, modern tunings such as 17-tet do offer regular diatonic semitones<br/>of around 1/3-tone (in 17-tet, 1/17 octave or about 70.59 cents).  Also,<br/>while this would be less likely in Renaissance practice, modern practice<br/>for 19-tet may sometimes use that narrow one-step leading-tone (in earlier<br/>thaory, the chromatic semitone) at cadences.</p><p>Incidentally, thirdtones are mentioned around 1375 in one of the treatises<br/>of the Berkeley Manuscript or Paris Anonymous. In describing vocal<br/>intonation, the author says that a tone is divided into three parts, and<br/>that one should normally sing two of these parts when intoning a usual<br/>mi-fa interval (e.g. E-F), but should sing a narrow 1/3-tone for cadential<br/>semitones. Oliver Ellsworth has interpreted this as a 14th-century<br/>proposal for 19-tet, although such a reading of a treatise dealing only<br/>finding semitones in singing, not with polyphony or keyboard instruments,<br/>might be debatable.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
