For me, it&apos;s very<br/>interesting to read about his take on the 1960&apos;s scene, and what it<br/>meant to him. For example, at the Monterey Pop Festival, he was quite<br/>impressed with a number of the groups, including Otis Redding and Janis<br/>Joplin (didn&apos;t care for Hendrix burning his axe, though). But, his<br/>reaction to some of the modern, avant garde classical artists, such as<br/>Schoenberg, was most interesting. Here, he talks about the Darmstadt<br/>modern music festival, and what happened when he heard the music: &quot;It is<br/>mystifying how it happens, but I find that when I start hearing those<br/>strange sounds or discordant combinations, within a few minutes I feel a<br/>stomach cramp, and from stomach cramp I develop a terrible headache and<br/>nausea. At first I thought these physical effects were coincidental,<br/>that my suffering was due to some bad food I must have eaten; but it has<br/>happened again and again, right up to this day. I feel ashamed of<br/>myself, because thousands of people rave about this music. Though I am<br/>sure most of them are sincere in their appreciation, one has to wonder<br/>whether some are just behaving in a trendy manner, motivated by<br/>snobbery. Sometimes I can appreciate the intelligent combinations used,<br/>yet the whole gamut of this modern music, I am embarrassed to admit, is<br/>a physical problem to me. I have to try harder, maybe!&quot;<br/>   I also had a thought about Shankar&apos;s involvement with George Harrison<br/>(who really was deeply involved with Indian philosophy for the duration<br/>of his life after meeting Shankar)...wouldn&apos;t it have been fascinating<br/>if Harrison had been exposed to the tuning theories of Indian music, and<br/>shared them with the millions of Beatle fans? Perhaps they never talked<br/>about tuning, or maybe if they did, it just didn&apos;t seem like a big issue<br/>for Harrison. How different the Western music world may have been had<br/>all of us kids, who began playing guitar at the time of the Beatles,<br/>heard about microtones. We&apos;ll never know...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=33209 href="#33209">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/27/2002 1:10:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But, his<br/>&gt; reaction to some of the modern, avant garde classical artists,<br/>such as<br/>&gt; Schoenberg, was most interesting.

The problem with the Darmstadt school, at least in<br/>the 70&apos;s when I participated in it (I think 1974) was a particular<br/>closed-mindedness, reflective of that time.</p><p>They *were* listening to sounds, however.  I remember Stockhausen<br/>banging and scraping on a huge tam-tam in his _Microphonie_ and<br/>Xenakis with some nice spacially-located percussion licks.  Much of<br/>this stuff was actually likeable.</p><p>However, I once mentioned the name &quot;Charles Ives&quot; and some of the<br/>other composers wouldn&apos;t talk to me (although we had been to the<br/>disco the night before...)  His music was sometimes &quot;tonal&quot; and,<br/>therefore, thoroughly &quot;reactionary.&quot;  I never for a moment would say<br/>a work like &quot;Bartok&quot; without getting an extreme treatment of one kind<br/>or another.</p><p>But, Darmstadt was just a reflection, then, of the times... the early<br/>60&apos;s and, I believe, this is the period Shankar is referring to.</p><p>Not much of this attitude exists anymore, by the way, even in<br/>Europe... although there are a few holdovers.</p><p>Most &quot;academic&quot; music in America, at least, is now pretty varied.<br/>The music departments are mostly &quot;reacting&quot; to that trend.  (Sure,<br/>somebody&apos;s going to find a contradicting example, but I&apos;m just<br/>speaking on the &quot;overview.&quot;)</p><p>Good examples of what I&apos;m talking about are appointments of people<br/>such as Steve Mackey</p><p><a href="http://www.stevenmackey.com/">http://www.stevenmackey.com/</a></p><p>at Princeton... an electronic guitar guy (and fine composer),</p><p>Michael Daugherty</p><p><a href="http://www.music.umich.edu/faculty/daugherty.michael.html">http://www.music.umich.edu/faculty/daugherty.michael.html</a></p><p>at the U.

I have to try harder, maybe!&quot;</p><p>Ravi Shankar was brought up in a musical tradition which would have sensitized him greatly to<br/>pitch, sound and timbre, much more so than that to which most Westerners are accustomed.<br/>Furthermore the musical conditions under which he was trained to play would have relied on a very<br/>tightly bound physical/spiritual union, again absent from much Western practice. The goal of some<br/>Indian Classical training, as I understand from my experience, is to refine and refine your<br/>attitudes and responses as you progress. Many Westerners dismiss this as mumbo-jumbo. But it&apos;s no<br/>surprise to me that his physical reaction was one of rejection. I seem to remember reading that<br/>Morton Feldman had a similar reaction as a child the first time he was taken to listen to a Bartok<br/>recital. He felt sick and developed a headache and had to be taken home.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3><a id=33394 href="#33394">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/2002 12:33:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Michael Daugherty<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.music.umich.edu/faculty/daugherty.michael.html">http://www.music.umich.edu/faculty/daugherty.michael.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; at the U.
