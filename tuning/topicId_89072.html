If x is the root 2.9963... of the polynomial<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; x^4+4*x^3+4*x^2+32*x-320<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; then substituting y-2 for x into the polynomial shows that x+2 will be<br/>&gt; a root of y^4-4*y^3+4*y^2+32*y-384, and substituting 10-z for x will prove that z^4-44*z^3+724*z^2-5312*z+14400 has a root equal to 10-x.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now consider 225/224, which factors as 2^(-5) 3^2 5^2 7^(-1). Substituting x, x+2 and 10-x in place of 3, 5, and 7, and subtracting 1 yields (x^4+4*x^3+4*x^2+32*x-320)/(32 (10-x)), which by the polynomial satisfied by x equals zero. Hence, the tuning tempers out 225/224, and is therefore a marvel tuning.

It seems you&apos;ve probably never experimented with equal-beating chords, otherwise I would assume you&apos;d be interested in both topics.<br/>Even if it wasn&apos;t significantly meaningful for one particular piece of music, it is undoubtedly an useful method when tuning by ear since you just do the &quot;tempering&quot; (whatever you want to call it) in such a way that &quot;this fifth beats as fast as that third and twice as fast as that third&quot; and so on. And if the overtones are close enough to regular harmonics and if they are loud enough, this is indeed audible -- I&apos;ve tried it on a harpsichord at school.<br/>BTW: Some years ago, I&apos;ve actually made some quasi-meantone equal-beating temperaments and if you have an efficient way to check your calculations while doing this, the process can be quite straight-forward -- if you have Manuel&apos;s scale archive, you can look for files starting with &quot;parizek_qmeb&quot;-something if you want further details.</p><p>&gt; For eg, some time ago I calculated that PHI is best represented in a &gt; 36-tET as 2^(25/36)<br/>&gt; and its inverse 2^(11/36). Since ratios = differences then we obtain the &gt; best equal beating possible.<br/>&gt; Yet at the end of the day these PHI intervals sounded awful.</p><p>Mixing phi and octaves probably can&apos;t bring any particularly pleasant intervals because neither phi*2 nor phi/2 makes much sense acoustically. However, a chain of consecutive phis really can sound interesting because they essentially represent both difference and summation tones of each other. I&apos;ve tried it some years ago and I have to admit that it more or less works --- with the sole exception that a piece of music in such a &quot;phi tuning&quot; can occur only once -- because trying to make one more would sound very similar.<br/>And anyway, I&apos;m still more attracted by periodicity rather than phi, so I probably won&apos;t be the one who makes the significant breakthrough. :-D</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=89183 href="#89183">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2010 9:12:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Not to worry Gene, come to think of it you did enter into the discussion later on and I probably assumed you&apos;d been following so I didn&apos;t reiterate.
