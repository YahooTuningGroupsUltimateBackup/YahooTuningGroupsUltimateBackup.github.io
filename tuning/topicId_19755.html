Most proximal quads, expansive and contractive</p><p>Now, the easiest way to make that tree friendly would be<br/>to just add $. before it:</p><p>$.1.1. Most proximal quads, expansive and contractive</p><p>Then when included in the final FAQ, the $ at the beginning<br/>would be expanded to give the number for the article itself<br/>in the faq.</p><p>In a reference such as<br/>see (Section 3)</p><p>you can just prefix the 3 with $$ like this</p><p>see (Section $$.3)</p><p>Using $$. instead of $. will help the program to make the distinction<br/>between an actual new section heading, and a reference to one<br/>already given.</p><p>Now, how will this fit in with the other method?</p><p>The other idea, to recall, was to use the likes of:</p><p>$.$.trines</p><p>as a bookmark just before the section heading, with the number<br/>of $ signs showing how far in to nest the section heading in<br/>the ascii numbering</p><p>With that idea, one doesn&apos;t need to number the sections at all, just<br/>use bookmarks, and the numbers are all inserted automatically<br/>by the program.</p><p>So, could they be combined?</p><p>Answer is yes.</p><p>Idea then is, in a bookmark like</p><p>$.$.trines</p><p>the number of full stops gives the number of levels of nesting of the<br/>section heading (ignoring any final full stop).</p><p>So, $.1.1. will be treated by the program as just another level 2 bookmark</p><p>- would have same effect as<br/>$.$.most_proximal<br/>or<br/>$.aaa.bbb<br/>or whatever</p><p>It will replace the $.1.1. by the appropriate numbers for your section<br/>but if you have got the numbering right, it will find the numbers<br/>as ...1.1. again, so it will be just the same.</p><p>Since it is also going to replace all the (see section $$.1.1.) by<br/>links to the section originally called $.1.1., then even if you left a gap<br/>in the number system, your references to it will still work after the<br/>program renumbers everything.</p><p>So I suggest we do that.</p><p>To avoid confusing the program, now that one may have the bookmark at the<br/>beginning of a line of text, I suggest that the bookmark only continues<br/>as far as the next space. If you want to make an ascii bookmark<br/>called most proximal, then join the words together by replacing the<br/>space with an underline character</p><p>$.most_proximal.<br/>...<br/>(see $$.most_proximal)</p><p>One might want to preserve a numbering system with gaps in it, for some reason<br/>- one should allow for that eventuality.</p><p>So to tell the program that you want all your numbers preserved exactly as they<br/>are, put<br/>$.$.ok</p><p>as the first line in the file<br/>instead of<br/>$.$.$</p><p>It will then leave all your ascii bookmarks exactly as they are, and only<br/>substitute for the $. part at the beginning.</p><p>I think this should work fine.</p><p>Any comments, or anyone foresee something else that might need to be addressed<br/>in it?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
