A chord<br/>&gt;       (not in a functional sense but in an audible sense)<br/>&gt;       includes a melody sung against a drone, particularly<br/>&gt;       if that drone is a 3:2 dyad.</p><p>I was not saying it could not be important with chords. Just what has been the case</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    2) An unaccompanied melodist in a non-resonant room<br/>&gt;       can be &apos;off&apos; by a large amount (including resultant<br/>&gt;       drift) and the pitch class vibe will be coming<br/>&gt;       through. In other words, the targets may be<br/>&gt;       interpreted as JI, however the execution will<br/>&gt;       be far off and tolerated.</p><p>I assume this refers to some test you know about. The set up of this test seems to be quite odd.<br/>Why a non resonant room. why not plug their ears all together so they had no feed back at all.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    3) There are lots of cultures which deal with identical<br/>&gt;       step sizes as in Western diatonic, pythagorean tuning<br/>&gt;       of Eastern pentatonics, close approximate to 7-ET<br/>&gt;       used in other Asian countries.</p><p>Pythagorean tunings do exist on many string instruments in Japan, China Vietnam. The tuning is<br/>done by fourths and fifth not by successive scale steps all with the goal to make the former<br/>interval beatless. The scale I have seen referred to as 7 ET or ET appears in all the cent<br/>measurements I have seen to be consistently not ET at all</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    4) I&apos;m inclined to think that since the ear is a<br/>&gt;       logarithmic machine, low-number ETs may be easier<br/>&gt;       to &quot;grok&quot; psychoacoustically than medium high<br/>&gt;       RI type numbers (16/13, things in the range between<br/>&gt;       being tunable and being indistinquishable from<br/>&gt;       an &quot;out of tune lower valued JI&quot;</p><p>I know of no one tuning any ET by Ear whereas JI can and is done repeatedly</p><p>&gt;    5) There is a lot of expressive singing that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;       seem to match anything mathematic, whether JI<br/>&gt;       or otherwise. I tend to look at some of the bent<br/>&gt;       blues notes that way, (with no disrespect for Monz<br/>&gt;       RI analysis of said notes) and Gerald Eskelins<br/>&gt;       search for the high third may have been the same<br/>&gt;       (it seemed to be somewhere between 12ED2 and<br/>&gt;       pythagorean, but what and why?)</p><p>I will fully agree that the emotional intent of a line will change the intonation in ways that no<br/>one has examined in a way to see what the results are, whether JI or not. It does seem quite<br/>possible that deviations from a JI base might be perceived as just that, extension either up or<br/>down from points of reference. There is no way of knowing how these things happen.</p><p>    But let us look at the problem on a larger scale. McLaren is right when he says that many<br/>cultures do not use JI. The fact is most do not use JI.</p><p>So what is it they are doing.</p><p>It seems they are hearing something, that like with us, has been culturally developed. If we<br/>accept this we have to infer that there is some acoustical phenomenon going on that can be<br/>perceived and can be recreated in making a scale. Being acoustical in root of some kind means that<br/>the tuner has no need of mathematics in it creation. Here i think Brian will agree with me.</p><p>    Logically, i do not see how any scale could be made without an acoustical method of<br/>construction, or as in our case, without a mathematical imitation or elaboration of such<br/>phenomenon.</p><p>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
