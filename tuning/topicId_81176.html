I&apos;ve heard some of his futujara recordings about half a year ago and I&apos;m afraid he is not making much use of the melodic possibilities of the instrument. Nevertheless, he claims there&apos;s an overtone flute called &quot;kalyuka&quot; in Russia, which I don&apos;t know much about. But I would be surprised if Russian folk music should include a flute which is played in an almost &quot;quasi-percussive&quot; fashion. In folk music of Sweden and Norway, the so-called &quot;willow flute&quot; is a very popular instrument (i.e. &quot;s&auml;lgfl&ouml;jt&quot; in Swedish, &quot;seljefl&ouml;yte&quot; in Norwegian). If you listen to Swedish or Norwegian musicians playing it, it&apos;s much more &quot;melodical&quot; than what Mr. Nadishana is doing. Not only Swedish and Norwegian, but the same is true for Slovak folk music where &quot;fujara&quot; and &quot;koncovka&quot; are amongst the most favored instruments (actually, &quot;koncovka&quot; could be translated as something like an &quot;end flute&quot;; the name for the instrument probably comes from the fact that no other flute uses alternate opening and closing of its opposite endto change tones). I think some overtone flute players treat the instrument a bit similarly as someone could treat a didgeridoo. :-D However, overtone flutes can sound pretty &quot;expressive&quot;, actually. About 4 years ago, I heard a recording of a french flutist who was in Sweden for some time and learned to play the &quot;willow flute&quot; very nicely (unfortunately, the link doesn&apos;t exist anymore). And some time later, there were even some recordings of Finnish musicians accompaniing the singer Leena Joutsenlahti (one of them was playing an overtone flute) -- maybe I have saved it on my laptop&apos;s hard drive, I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>Anyway, my very first experience with overtone flutes was some day in 2003 when I almost fell in love with the sound of a hollow metal pipe, so much so that I began to learn playing it with an unusual passion -- BTW: At that time, I hadn&apos;t played an ordinary &quot;Boehm flute&quot; for about 3 months and I was only playing my overtone flute; and, lo and behold, when I took my Boehm flute into my hands after such a long time playing the overtone flute, I tried to play only about 20 tones and, from that short try, I realized I got my flute tone sounding perhaps a hundred times better than all those past years which I had attended flute lessons. :-D</p><p>To give a clear example of what I mean by &quot;melodic possibilities of overtone flutes&quot;, I made a short improv on the metal pipe I was talking about.
