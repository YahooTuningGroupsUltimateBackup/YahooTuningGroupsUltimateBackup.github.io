For instance:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant</a></p><p>Just one of the many on-line charts that will show that in fact most<br/>of the formant frequencies lie well below 2 kHz, and of the higher<br/>ones, very few are located in the 2-4 kHz range. Thus the slightly<br/>increased sensitivity we have in that range (Google &quot;phons&quot; and look<br/>for the dip) is NOT due to anything having to do with speech, a fact<br/>which can easily be proven by low-pass filtering any recording of<br/>speech. Chopping everything above about 1,5 kHz reduces the<br/>intelligibility only ever so slightly, and the greatest loss is in<br/>consonants, not vowels.</p><p>Far more important for human survival are auditory cues of approaching<br/>prey: snapping twigs, respiration, snarls, flapping wings, things of<br/>this nature, even things as subtle as acoustic shading of ambient<br/>white noise caused by large approaching sound absorbing bodies, like<br/>lions, tigers, and such. These sorts of life-saving cues DO tend to be<br/>composed primarily of higher frequencies, which might well explain the<br/>dip in the phons curve. I&apos;m not sure about the exact frequencies, but<br/>our outer ear is shaped in order to turn it into a highly sensitive<br/>directional locater at higher frequencies.</p><p>Regarding octave stretch. Whenever that comes up someone always chimes<br/>in with the same old arguments about how we have a preference for wide<br/>octaves. But as Terhard quite rightly points out, this is only<br/>melodically. When we hear octaves harmonically, we are spot on 2:1, of<br/>4:1, or 8:1, etc.</p><p>Pianos are tuned with stretch primarily in order to compensate for the<br/>inharmonicity of the strings, which is not constant over the entire<br/>instrument; it tends to be more pronounced in the lowest and highest<br/>octaves. A good tuner simply tunes &quot;pure&quot; (no beats), which in the<br/>case of a slightly inharmonic tone is by definition an inharmonic<br/>octave. It SOUNDS pure, but if measured, it is not 2:1. In the case of<br/>more complex inharmonic tones, like bells, the perception of &quot;pitch&quot;<br/>becomes highly complicated, and can be higher or lower than the<br/>&quot;fundamental&quot;, which in any event in the case of bells is usually the<br/>second partial, the &quot;hum tone&quot; being to weak to be taken as the<br/>fundamental.</p><p>Once again, read Sethares. A truly landmark work (excepting the<br/>chapter on historical temperaments, which is fundamentally flawed in<br/>concept - oh well, nobody&apos;s perfect!).</p><p>That said, a number of piano tuners don&apos;t know what they are doing and<br/>stretch too much or in regions which don&apos;t need it. This is especially<br/>true of those who have learned the craft with electronic devices. They<br/>simply enter a certain &quot;stretch curve&quot; and go! Throw in the ubiquitous<br/>lack of discrimination between melodic and harmonic perception theory<br/>and you&apos;ve got a recipe for general confusion and a large body of ugly<br/>sounding pianos. Until you get used to it, and then it sounds<br/>&quot;normal&quot;, and a properly tuned piano sounds out-of-tune.

Most naturally-<br/>&gt; occurring pitched sounds have perfectly harmonic overtones.</p><p>Hmmm, if that should be true, then I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s meant by &quot;naturally-occurring&quot;. Wonder where Paul E. got this claim. Whatever they get stretched or shrunk, I don&apos;t think they can get totally pure. For at least two reasons:</p><p>- 1. Pick a mid-pitched string (like the high E on a guitar, for example) and try to tune it terribly low (like two octaves lower or something similar) and pluck it. You&apos;ll immediately HEAR (you don&apos;t need to measure anything) that the intervals in the overtone series are now much wider than when the string was tight. After trying to reach a meaningful conclusion for years, I gave it up and asked prof. Joe Wolfe of the Australian UNSW what he thought about it. He himself has told me that to get the overtones 100% harmonic, the string would have to be &quot;infinitely tight&quot;, which is impossible as this would stop it vibrating. This could explain why some musicians (especially somewhere around Wienna, AFAIK) tend to tune A4 to 444 or 445Hz.</p><p>- 2. If I make a hole into a hollow pipe and put something like a piece of cork very far from it, then, when blowing into the hole, I&apos;ll not only hear the higher overtones softer but also all the intervals will sound shrunk compared to pure harmonics. The closer I put the piece of cork to the hole, the closer the overtones get to pure harmonics.</p><p>And maybe there could be even more examples of stretching and shrinking overtones, I don&apos;t know. But anyway, why should human voice be an exception breaking all of these rules? Or is there perhaps something wrong with my hearing and with prof. Wolfe&apos;s statements?</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=77402 href="#77402">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2008 12:48:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hiya Paul,</p><p>&gt; Far more important for human survival are auditory cues of<br/>&gt; approaching prey: snapping twigs, respiration, snarls, flapping<br/>&gt; wings, things of this nature,</p><p>I strongly disagree.

Most<br/>string instruments with relatively thin strings have overtones which<br/>are very very close to being harmonic, for all practical purposes,<br/>harmonic. Only at very low tensions do they become noticably inharmonic.</p><p>It&apos;s really rather simple. The normal restoring force of a stretched<br/>string is tension. Rigidity creates an additional restoring force, the<br/>more rigid, the more extra force. This force increases the<br/>acceleration of the returning string during each cycle, and is more<br/>significant at higher modes. Thus higher overtones are shifted upward<br/>in frequency.</p><p>When you tune a string way down, you have reduced the normal restoring<br/>force drastically, but rigidty is the same, meaning it is much more<br/>signficant. Thus inharmonicity goes up. So what? This proves nothing.</p><p>&gt; This could explain why some musicians (especially somewhere around<br/>Wienna, AFAIK) tend to tune A4 to 444 or 445Hz.</p><p>Say WHAT?

A hollow pipe with a hole near one end can serve as such a flute if you put a piece of cork (or simply something which prevents the air from getting to places you don&apos;t want) near the blowing hole. But if the cork is not close enough to the blowing hole, than the overtone series is rather mistuned as compared to regular harmonics -- to be more precise, the intervals are &quot;audibly&quot; smaller. OTOH, if the cork is too close to the hole, then the overtones themselves are essentially harmonic but this could stop the sound echoing. So it&apos;s important to find some position &quot;in-between&quot; where the sound is echoing well in the pipe and at the same time the overtones sound more or less harmonic. Concerning normal non-overtone flutes, care should be also taken while overblowing to higher registers because if the overtones were harmonic and you blowed stronger than when playing in the low register, this could actually make octaves significantly wider.

A<br/>hollow pipe with a hole near one end can serve as such a flute if you<br/>put a piece of cork (or simply something which prevents the air from<br/>getting to places you don&apos;t want) near the blowing hole. But if the<br/>cork is not close enough to the blowing hole, than the overtone series<br/>is rather mistuned as compared to regular harmonics -- to be more<br/>precise, the intervals are &quot;audibly&quot; smaller. OTOH, if the cork is too<br/>close to the hole, then the overtones themselves are essentially<br/>harmonic but this could stop the sound echoing. So it&apos;s important to<br/>find some position &quot;in-between&quot; where the sound is echoing well in the<br/>pipe and at the same time the overtones sound more or less harmonic.<br/>Concerning normal non-overtone flutes, care should be also taken while<br/>overblowing to higher registers because if the overtones were harmonic<br/>and you blowed stronger than when playing in the low register, this<br/>could actually make octaves significantly wider. Prof. Wolfe mentions<br/>this on his webpage about Boehm flutes:<br/><a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/fluteacoustics.html#cork">www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/fluteacoustics.html#cork</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>You seem not to have understood Paul Poletti&apos;s point. The resonances<br/>of the flute may be very inharmonic, leading to an inharmonic series<br/>of tones, but each tone will still have harmonic partials (except<br/>during the short decay after blowing is stopped).</p><p>I believe Joe Wolfe&apos;s paper agrees with this, although I can see how<br/>it could easily be misunderstood.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=77429 href="#77429">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 6:56:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; One simple rule is: If the system is being continuously driven, i.e.<br/>&gt; energy is being put into the system continuously, as opposed to being<br/>&gt; put in in a single impulse, then the partials will be strictly<br/>&gt; harmonic.

I just<br/>couldn&apos;t figure out exactly what you were saying with the cork business.</p><p>&gt; briefly, it&apos;s the one with no finger holes (you change the tones<br/>just by changing the speed and thickness of the air stream or by<br/>opening/closing the opposite end of the flute with your hand). A<br/>hollow pipe with a hole near one end can serve as such a flute if you<br/>put a piece of cork (or simply something which prevents the air from<br/>getting to places you don&apos;t want) near the blowing hole. But if the<br/>cork is not close enough to the blowing hole, than the overtone series<br/>is rather mistuned as compared to regular harmonics -- to be more<br/>precise, the intervals are &quot;audibly&quot; smaller.</p><p>Right, now I know what you were getting at. Much as I suspected, you<br/>are confusing impedance minima/maxima with spectral inharmonicity, a<br/>common misconception. While the two are closely related, they are in<br/>fact two completely different things.</p><p>Impedance determines the frequencies to which the oscillation will<br/>jump when the tube is overblown, but it does NOT affect the component<br/>frequencies of individual complex tones produce by the instrument;<br/>these tones are always perfectly harmonic. This is due to &quot;mode<br/>locking&quot;; when a tube has impedance peaks or dips which are<br/>inharmonic, when it is driven by an excitation mechanism that is<br/>couple to the tube and has an undefined frequency of oscillation of<br/>its own, the totality of the complex tone produced by the<br/>excitor/resonator duality (both forming the oscillator) is a harmonic<br/>&quot;best fit&quot; of them all. The way to experience this on your overtone<br/>flute is to use a setup which produces a very inharmonic register<br/>shift pattern, and then make recordings of the individual notes. Exam<br/>them with any spectral analysis software and I am absolutely certain<br/>you will find that the spectral content of each tone is exactly harmonic.</p><p>Clarinet is a perfect example. When it is overblown, it follows a<br/>register shift pattern which approximates only the odd harmonics, but<br/>the notes are rather out of tune, and the higher you go, the more out<br/>of tune they are, and quite so. Yet a spectral analysis will<br/>demonstrate that any one of the tones in any register is completely<br/>harmonic. Furthermore, contrary to what most people think, the<br/>spectral content is NOT limited to only the odd harmonics. The common<br/>misconception that even harmonics are completely absent in clarinet<br/>tone is only vaguely true for the notes in the first register. Even<br/>these are only missing the 2 and 4th harmonic; above 5, they are all<br/>there, even and odd, though odd tend to be stronger. In the second<br/>register already the tone has a very strong presence of all harmonics,<br/>even and odd. This is due once again to the different acoustic<br/>functions of the tube: the primary function of determining the<br/>fundamental frequency and the secondary function of filtering the<br/>spectral content produced by the excitation mechanism. Because the<br/>feedback loop of mode locking, the reed can only fundamentally excite<br/>the tube at one of its resonant frequencies, but the reed itself is<br/>producing a tone which is fairly rich in harmonics because it doesn&apos;t<br/>open and close in a perfect sin wave. This tone is in turn filtered by<br/>the resonances of the tube to a greater or lessor extent, but the even<br/>harmonics produced by the reed are by no means completely eliminated<br/>by this filtering process. Confusing these to separate functions leads<br/>to much common misconception about the function of wind instruments.</p><p>One of the things I always stress in my classes is that<br/>&quot;inharmonicity&quot; in strings and in wind instruments manifests in<br/>fundamentally different ways, so any time ones hears the word one<br/>needs to be attentive to context.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=77441 href="#77441">ðŸ”—</a>Cris Forster &#x3C;cris.forster@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 10:33:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; If you look around for &quot;coefficient of inharmonicty&quot; you&apos;ll quickly<br/>&gt; come across formulas that predict it.

Your intuitive<br/>insight, in the midst of our conversations about neo-Gothic music and<br/>complex ratios, that Keenan Pepper&apos;s focus on Phi might afford us a<br/>mathematical tool for identifying approximate regions of maximum<br/>complexity, was a highlight at once to inspire intellectual delight<br/>and to motivate new musical explorations.</p><p>My purpose here is to express my appreciation while suggesting one<br/>possible perspective to put this and related questions of harmonic<br/>entropy or tension in a larger musical context. This isn&apos;t to tie the<br/>general kind of theory we&apos;re discussing to any specific tuning system<br/>or style, only suggest that the theory may take on greater<br/>concreteness as people do explore the JI-to-MI continuum in a variety<br/>of systems and styles. The challenge seems always to be taking into<br/>account a range of specifics while striving not to preclude new<br/>systems or styles from emerging which might, in turn, both enrich and<br/>modify the established general theory.</p><p>One drawback of theorizing in a &quot;rich context&quot; of style and<br/>counterpoint is that not only might it lead to overgeneralizations,<br/>but it tends to lead to longer posts, not always ideal for easy and<br/>relaxed dialogue. I apologize for this possible drawback, and seek as<br/>a partial remedy to invite you or anyone to &quot;break in&quot; at any point<br/>and offer a comment or ask a question.</p><p>------------------------------------<br/>1. The importance of musical context<br/>------------------------------------</p><p>What I would emphasize at the outset is that how we view tunings or<br/>specific intervals may depend on how we make music, and what styles we<br/>are accustomed to, as has been suggested in certain recent discussions<br/>here. Thus I find 17-EDO or George Secor&apos;s masterful 17-WT a &quot;natural&quot;<br/>system both because the structure nicely fits a 13th-14th century<br/>European style to which I&apos;m accustomed, and because of the most<br/>fruitful musical dialogue and friendship which George has shared with<br/>me in an incredibly rich &quot;cross-pollination,&quot; to use his felicitous<br/>term.</p><p>Also, I might guess that intervals in the general region of 950 cents<br/>are very attractive to me because they fit with a style where a major<br/>sixth expands by stepwise contrary motion to an octave, while a minor<br/>seventh likewise contracts to a fifth, with either type of resolution<br/>often being possible in this &quot;interseptimal&quot; region between 12:7 and<br/>7:4. Also, anything in the range of around 940-960 cents is likely to<br/>delight me, because of these contrapuntal and melodic possibilities,<br/>quite apart from the niceties of harmonic entropy or &quot;just how<br/>metastable is really metastable?&quot; Further, I would happily use a 12:7<br/>major sixth or 7:4 minor seventh in similar contexts: the different<br/>shadings are largely &quot;musically interchangeable,&quot; like nuances of a<br/>well-temperament, with variety itself the spice of style.</p><p>Someone trying out 17-EDO or George&apos;s 17-WT from a perspective<br/>grounded in 18th-19th century European styles, or using 950 cents as a<br/>representation of 4:7 in styles of this kind or others where 4:5:6:7<br/>is intended rather than a stimulating variation on something like<br/>4:6:7 or 14:21:24 or 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 resolving by stepwise<br/>contrary motion, may have a quite different response. The tuning<br/>environment is likely to seem not su much a stimulating variation on<br/>the familiar as a more or less radical departure or dislocation,<br/>whether this is taken as a clue to consider a different tuning, or a<br/>fascinatingly &quot;warped&quot; intonational space with new possibilities.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. A continuum: MI, JI, RI, TI -- and VI (Variegated Intonation)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>This brings me to a main point about MI: however it is defined, I<br/>would regard it simply as one part of a useful continuum where all<br/>points have musical value, and fine shadings of harmonic entropy serve<br/>mostly to adorn a contrapuntal and melodic texture rather than to<br/>dictate its structure. Thus I&apos;d consider the MI region of 422 cents a<br/>great neomedieval major third (often expanding to a fifth, or<br/>contracting to a unison) -- and likewise anything within 15 cents on<br/>either side. In Zest-24, for example, the usual sizes would be 408,<br/>409, 422, or 434 cents. The nuances of entropy or color ornament the<br/>happy fact of musical interchangeability. Further, in this<br/>temperament, I often use sizes of 441, 442, 445, 454, or 455 cents in<br/>a similar fashion as very large major thirds, relishing that the last<br/>three values especially are in the interseptimal region between 9:7<br/>and 21:16.</p><p>From my perspective of Variegated Intonation or VI, where lots of<br/>subtle shadings are a big plus and indeed a system like Zest-24 seems<br/>to specialize in being &quot;all over the map&quot; with a relatively modest<br/>number of notes, one might envision MI as part of a continuum about as<br/>follows, which may tie in with your metallic concepts.</p><p>If we start with JI involving small integer ratios, or &quot;valleys&quot; of<br/>clarity and strong consonance like 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3, and let the<br/>ratios grow more complex, then we eventually reach the realm of<br/>Rational Intonation or RI where large integer ratios may more or less<br/>blend in with surrounding irrational ratios along the continuum --<br/>adding, as you often have, that in special sonorities such as<br/>isoharmonic ones very complex RI ratios may become &quot;aurally JI.&quot; All<br/>points are valued options on the spectrum.</p><p>If we start with noble mediants between small integer ratios or JI<br/>valleys, then we arrive at approximate peak regions for harmonic<br/>entropy, tension, ambiguity, cloudiness, or diffuse richness -- MI,<br/>however it might be experienced. As the integer ratios being mediated<br/>in a Phi-weighted fashion get more complex and RI-ish, however, the<br/>connection between a mathematical noble mediant and aural MI becomes<br/>more tenuous, and ultimately may point us to regions interesting<br/>because of other musical considerations than &quot;maximum entropy.&quot;</p><p>One term that occurs to me which might embrace the use both of complex<br/>RI ratios and of noble mediants derived from such ratios would be<br/>&quot;Tele-Intonation&quot; or TI -- using mathematical tools associated with<br/>the simplest (JI) and most complex or ambiguous (MI) intervals to<br/>arrive at some more &quot;distant&quot; and at least partially unpredictable<br/>destination.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Mapping the contours -- tuning and counterpoint<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>An approach that much appeals to me might be a kind of &quot;map&quot; of the<br/>continuum, with some main JI and MI regions -- and also, a la Paul<br/>Erlich, some indication of the intervening contours.</p><p>For example, in Zest-24, here are the sizes available in the general<br/>region around and between 12:7 (933 cents) and 7:4 (969 cents):</p><p>926 932 933 938 946 950 957 959 963 976 982 983</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to ask if 946 cents represents an approximate &quot;peak&quot;<br/>of MI or complexity within this set of sizes, being near as it is to<br/>the noble mediant at about 943 cents. Often I tend to think of 926-938<br/>cents as mainly related to 12:7; 946 or 950 cents as ideally<br/>interseptimal and flexible; 957 or 959 cents as leaning toward 7:4,<br/>but still somewhat interseptimal; and 963-983 cents as 7:4 country.<br/>What might a contour map look like?</p><p>In reflecting on these sizes, one thing occurs to me: often I might<br/>regard the degree of &quot;tension&quot; or &quot;excitement&quot; as depending not only<br/>on the intrinsic properties of an interval, but on how it is used.<br/>Thus if asked to think of something &quot;radical,&quot; I might focus on using<br/>938 cents, a routine representation of 12:7, as a very small minor<br/>seventh in something like F-G*-C-D* (0-243-696-938 cents) resolving to<br/>the fifth C*-G* with melodic steps of 192 cents down (D*-C*, A*-G*)<br/>and 50 cents up (C-C*, G-G*). Here the special excitement seems to<br/>center on treating 243 cents as a small minor third and 938 cents as a<br/>small minor seventh although they are closer to 8:7 and 12:7 than to<br/>7:6 and 7:4. Since 243 cents is right around the noble mediant between<br/>8:7 and 7:6, MI might be playing an important role; but I&apos;d suspect<br/>that the contrapuntal context is also central. For example, resolving<br/>from F-A*-C-D* (0-434-696-938 cents, with C-D* at 241.4 cents), to<br/>Eb-Bb-Eb is a standard progression featuring a tempered version of<br/>14:18:21:24 -- although here, the arrangement of the intervals (might<br/>one speak of &quot;otonality&quot; in a context of factors 2-3-7-9?) may play a<br/>role as well as the melodic and contrapuntal action.</p><p>-------------------------<br/>4. How wide an MI region?<br/>-------------------------</p><p>A final point for now: as I recall, in our original concept, a noble<br/>mediant between two significant JI valleys would likely mark the<br/>general region of a maximum, or the central portion of a plateau,<br/>rather than a specific point where &quot;something happens&quot; comparable to<br/>locking in of partials at the focus of a JI valley. This suggests to<br/>me that MI should involve regions of some considerable size, rather<br/>than specific values, with the noble mediant as a general guide.</p><p>Thus, intuitively, I&apos;d guess that if 943 cents is a significant noble<br/>mediant -- &quot;titanium&quot; in your listing -- then 946 cents should be more<br/>or less similar in its MI qualities, albeit with subtly different<br/>shadings. More generally, I wonder if &quot;MI&quot; might embrace to a degree<br/>almost anything between about 940 and 960 cents, say, a kind of<br/>plateau between 12:7 and the deeper 7:4 valley, albeit with the<br/>contours peaking at somewhere around 943 cents, or 10 cents from 12:7.</p><p>In making my sampling of &quot;MI&quot; or the like in Zest-24, I wanted to<br/>explore some of these questions. How large is an MI region, and how<br/>might we describe the shades somewhere between &quot;JI&quot; and &quot;MI&quot; in effect<br/>(whether derived through RI, Phi-based TI, or pragmatic tempering of<br/>other sorts)? How do MI properties, or shadings of entropy more<br/>generally, interact with contrapuntal and melodic context?</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77450 href="#77450">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 5:09:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>Thanks for joining the discussion. I agree with all that you wrote.<br/>And I understand you to be cautioning us not to see everything as an<br/>approximation of either justness or metastability, as a man with new<br/>hammer might see everything as a nail.</p><p>In regard to your proposed term TI (tele-intonation): I believe the<br/>adoption of the term MI (metastable/merciful/murky intonation) frees<br/>up the term NI (noble intonation) for exactly the purpose for which<br/>you intended TI.</p><p>The analogy is: Rational is to Just as Noble is to Metastable. To<br/>explain: Rational and Noble are mathematical properties while Just and<br/>Metastable are aural. Only the simpler Rationals &quot;explain&quot; Just<br/>intervals and only the simpler Nobles &quot;explain&quot; (most) Metastable<br/>intervals.</p><p>The qualification &quot;(most)&quot; above, is to recognise that simple noble<br/>numbers do not explain the metastable intervals closest to the unison,<br/>octave, fifth and on the low side of the fourth (this last one<br/>recently pointed out by Carl Lumma as affecting the accuracy of our<br/>2000 article).</p><p>Harmonic entropy maxima appear to &quot;explain&quot; all the metastables, but<br/>are not so mathematically convenient as noble numbers.</p><p>I agree that your question &quot;just how metastable is really metastable?&quot;<br/>is something people must answer for themselves. However, I wonder if<br/>the classic mediant of the last two attractor intervals might<br/>conventionally form one boundary of the metastable region, and the<br/>interval having the same harmonic entropy might form the boundary on<br/>the other side. In your 12:7 to 7:4 case (with noble mediant at 942.5<br/>cents) this would be 19:11 (946 cents) and about 939 cents.</p><p>You asked, &quot;What might a contour map look like?&quot;</p><p>Might it look like a Harmonic Entropy curve, such as one of these<br/>three, made for you by Paul Erlich?<br/><a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/margo.gif">/tuning/files/dyadic/margo.gif</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/margo2.gif">/tuning/files/dyadic/margo2.gif</a><br/><a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/margo3.gif">/tuning/files/dyadic/margo3.gif</a></p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=77451 href="#77451">ðŸ”—</a>Cris Forster &#x3C;cris.forster@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2008 6:09:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cris Forster&quot; &lt;cris.forster@&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The coefficient of inharmonicity is a function of the stiffness<br/>&gt; &gt; parameter J, and so not easy to calculate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t you mean E?

However, since 4*7 is considerably simpler than 7*12, it&apos;s not<br/>so surprising that the harmonically entropic point of &quot;equipoise&quot; is<br/>rather closer to 12:7, in fact only about 10 cents wider.</p><p>This could have real explanatory power for certain aspects of 14-EDO<br/>and 24-EDO, for example. With 14-EDO, I approached it confident that<br/>11/14 octave or 943 cents would make a nice wide &quot;major sixth&quot;<br/>variation on 12:7 -- but would it be large enough persuasively to<br/>suggest a very small &quot;minor seventh&quot; like 7:4? I tried it, and found<br/>that it happily was. Knowing that I was right at the point of entropic<br/>equipose might make this pleasant musical result more comprehensible.</p><p>Then, again, let&apos;s consider 24-EDO with its interval of 950 cents.<br/>Here my point will be one of style and entropy. Too often, in my view,<br/>24-EDO gets written about in rather general or unqualified terms when<br/>the focus is on a rather specific application: some kind of classic<br/>18th-19th century European style or derivative where 4:5:6:7 is a<br/>primary ideal (if not necessarily of standard period practice, then of<br/>certain modern offshoots). Please let me emphasize that I&apos;m in no way<br/>opposing an interest in the tuning of 4:5:6:7 or the choice of tunings<br/>to realize this sonority, only to caution that there are various other<br/>uses for ratios such as 4:7 and 6:7.</p><p>If we start with 4:5:6:7 as a premise, then I&apos;d say it should quickly<br/>become clear that 31-EDO would be dramatically more accurate for<br/>everything except, of course, 3:2. However, let&apos;s suppose that instead<br/>we&apos;re following a neomedieval kind of bent, say, and would like to<br/>represent 4:6:7 in a kind of &quot;manneristic&quot; or &quot;avant-garde&quot; way.</p><p>If so, then 0-700-950 cents might nicely fit the purpose -- and the<br/>noble mediant at 943 cents tells us that 950 cents is actually leaning<br/>a bit in the direction of 7:4. Contrapuntally, in resolutions of this<br/>0-700-950 sonority by stepwise contrary motion, voices are typically<br/>going to move either by 200-cent tones or 50-cent steps serving as<br/>very small semitones -- a beautiful sound. Thus D-A-B* (the * shows a<br/>note raised by 1/24 octave, the 50-cent quartertone step) might<br/>resolve to E-B or D*-A*, the 950-cent &quot;seventh&quot; contracting to a<br/>fifth; or to C-G-C or C*-G*-C*, the same interval used as a &quot;sixth&quot;<br/>expanding to an octave. Mathematically, 950 cents is the same distance<br/>of 250 cents from either a 700-cent fifth or a 1200-cent octave, so<br/>either progressive is equally &quot;efficient.&quot;</p><p>Entropically, we learn from the noble mediant that 0-700-950 cents,<br/>while thus flexible, has a bit of a tilt toward 7:4 -- an interesting<br/>nuance of a system which, of course, simply and elegantly provides a<br/>set of _interseptimal_ intervals (250, 450, 750, 950 cents) rather<br/>than accurate representations of septimal ratios. Thus if the goal is<br/>a kind of offbeat variation on 4:6:7 and the like in a setting where<br/>ratios of 2-3-7-9 without 5 are the main focus, and quite possibly<br/>neutral intervals also (150, 350, 850. 1050 cents), 24-EDO is an<br/>engaging system.</p><p>Here I&apos;ve taken a bit of space to show how entropy and counterpoint<br/>can interact, the former not necessarily determining the latter, but<br/>providing subtle gradations of nuance and color.</p><p>What I would urge is that we recognize a possible aesthetic, as in<br/>some consonance/dissonance theories of composition, of a subtle<br/>continuum, where we might now seek JI, now maximal MI, and now some<br/>intermediate grade of blend/tension or clarity/ambiguity. This might<br/>happen by deliberate calculation in the choice of interval sizes<br/>during a composition or improvisation, or by a &quot;prepared aleatory&quot;<br/>technique -- for example, an unequal temperament like Zest-24 where<br/>the variety of colors &quot;happens&quot; as one moves around without<br/>necessarily reasoning, &quot;I&apos;ll use 946 cents here, 950 cents there, and<br/>957 cents for this cadence.&quot;</p><p>Of course, a 17th-19th century well-temperament of the kind germinally<br/>presented by Werckmeister is a fine example. I wouldn&apos;t necessarily<br/>assume that Bach calculated every improvisatory move from a view of<br/>precise harmonic tension, which could vary from instrument to<br/>instrument, or that he used a single tuning scheme. However,<br/>&quot;variegation&quot; was clearly in the air, and the noble mediant gives one<br/>measure of the colors we may be painting with in composing or<br/>improvising.</p><p>&gt; In regard to your proposed term TI (tele-intonation): I believe the<br/>&gt; adoption of the term MI (metastable/merciful/murky intonation) frees<br/>&gt; up the term NI (noble intonation) for exactly the purpose for which<br/>&gt; you intended TI.</p><p>We agree -- that&apos;s a neat solution.</p><p>&gt; The analogy is: Rational is to Just as Noble is to Metastable. To<br/>&gt; explain: Rational and Noble are mathematical properties while Just<br/>&gt; and Metastable are aural. Only the simpler Rationals &quot;explain&quot; Just<br/>&gt; intervals and only the simpler Nobles &quot;explain&quot; (most) Metastable<br/>&gt; intervals.</p><p>Nicely put! A fine point is that while RI encompasses JI as a subset,<br/>in many contexts if I refer to a complex ratio like 176:117 as &quot;RI,&quot;<br/>there&apos;s what Paul Grice might call a &quot;conversational implicature&quot; that<br/>I am _not_ viewing it as aurally JI, but rather as a fifth &quot;tempered<br/>by ratio&quot; at not quite 5 cents wide. Similarly, in a setting where we<br/>are describing aural maxima as MI, to call some remote noble mediant<br/>&quot;NI&quot; would carry a suggestion that aural significance as a maximum<br/>(MI) is not alleged. Incidentally, MI could mean &quot;Maximal Intonation&quot;<br/>in &quot;harmonic entropy maximum&quot; terms.</p><p>&gt; The qualification &quot;(most)&quot; above, is to recognise that simple noble<br/>&gt; numbers do not explain the metastable intervals closest to the<br/>&gt; unison, octave, fifth and on the low side of the fourth (this last<br/>&gt; one recently pointed out by Carl Lumma as affecting the accuracy of<br/>&gt; our 2000 article).</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve always thought in terms of 4:5-7:9 (where 422 cents is a<br/>logical and musically likely result) rather than 4:5-3:4. An<br/>interesting and very likely culturally-linked or stylistically-linked<br/>point is that for the 4:5-7:9 region -- at least for those of us used<br/>to larger major thirds in the Pythagorean-septimal range of 408-435<br/>cents, 422 cents is not a point of _categorical_ ambiguity. We clearly<br/>have some kind of &quot;major third,&quot; indeed _the_ representation of this<br/>interval in a system like 17-EDO at 423.53 cents. What we have is a<br/>point of maximum complexity or tension within a category.</p><p>In the interseptimal space of 7:9-3:4 from a viewpoint of valleys, or<br/>something like 7:9-16:21 from my own perception that 21:16 is a<br/>clearly recognizable &quot;small fourth&quot; at a 64:63 comma narrow of 3:4,<br/>we&apos;re dealing not only with maximal entropy but, from a certain<br/>stylistic perspective, with _categorical_ ambiguity: a large major<br/>third, or a small fourth?</p><p>In a gamelan setting where the musical &quot;phonemes&quot; or basic categories<br/>of sound are quite different -- say an interval of two slendro steps<br/>-- categorical ambiguity very well might not apply: to speak<br/>linguistically, the &quot;opposition&quot; of &quot;European third/fourth&quot; might be<br/>quite extraneous. Of course, given the typical timbres, harmonic<br/>entropy maxima based on harmonic timbres might also be inapplicable!</p><p>Then, again, native perceptions within different traditions can be<br/>very interesting. For example, there&apos;s a view among some theorists in<br/>the Arab world that the maqamat (plural of _maqam_ or mode) which have<br/>a notably &quot;ecstatic&quot; effect are generally those with neutral steps and<br/>intervals (e.g. Bayyati, Husseini, Saba); while those with only major<br/>and minor steps are likely to be ecstatic more because of the skill of<br/>the player or receptiveness of the listener than &quot;by nature.&quot; Whatever<br/>else this may say, it tells us that a special appreciation of neutral<br/>intervals is not restricted to the outside listener unaccustomed to<br/>them.</p><p>&gt; Harmonic entropy maxima appear to &quot;explain&quot; all the metastables, but<br/>&gt; are not so mathematically convenient as noble numbers.</p><p>Yes, which is to say that shortcuts such as NI are at once valuable<br/>and less than all-encompassing. From an intuitive perspective, Carl<br/>and Dave, I might reason like this. Taking the noble mediant of<br/>4:5-3:4 must inevitably give a result weighted toward the more<br/>_complex_ ratio of 4:5, and thus nearer to it than the classic mediant<br/>of</p><p>5+4<br/>---<br/>4+3</p><p>or 9:7. However, we readily guess that maximum harmonic entropy will<br/>be closer to 3:4 than 7:9 is -- and thus we need something other than<br/>NI to find it, or at least other than the 4:5-3:4 pairing.</p><p>Even if we try 7:9-4:3, this likewise will give something closer to the<br/>more complex ratio, 7:9, than the classic mediant at 13:10. Like others<br/>who have discussed this question here such as Cameron Bobro, I&apos;d<br/>intuitively place the maximum of complexity at somewhere between 13:10 and<br/>21:16. Thus something other than a noble mediant would be needed to<br/>address this question. This isn&apos;t to say that 448 cents isn&apos;t a charming<br/>region.</p><p>&gt; I agree that your question &quot;just how metastable is really<br/>&gt; metastable?&quot;  is something people must answer for<br/>&gt; themselves. However, I wonder if the classic mediant of the last two<br/>&gt; attractor intervals might conventionally form one boundary of the<br/>&gt; metastable region, and the interval having the same harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; might form the boundary on the other side. In your 12:7 to 7:4 case<br/>&gt; (with noble mediant at 942.5 cents) this would be 19:11 (946 cents)<br/>&gt; and about 939 cents.</p><p>That&apos;s interesting -- here, about a 7-cent range for &quot;clear MI.&quot; Of<br/>course, from an outlook like that of 13th-century and some<br/>20th-century European counterpoint theory, we could recognize lots of<br/>degrees and shadings of &quot;perfect blend&quot; (JI), &quot;maximal ambiguity&quot;<br/>(MI), and intermediate conditions such as &quot;partial clarity&quot; (e.g. a<br/>major third at 400 cents in a meantone-like style, where the &quot;partial&quot;<br/>might be underscored) or &quot;partial ambiguity&quot; (e.g. an interseptimal<br/>950 cents as a very large major sixth or small minor seventh, not too<br/>far from MI at around 939-946 cents but a different shading).</p><p>Here there might be at least two dimensions, both of which harmonic<br/>entropy would take into account: the distance from a given JI or MI<br/>focus or region; and the &quot;depth&quot; or &quot;height&quot; of that valley or<br/>maximum.</p><p>As in the rules of intervallic counterpoint, we might sometimes want<br/>JI or MI, or the strongest contrast emphasizing an optimization of<br/>both: an analogous example in intervallic style would be the 12th-13th<br/>century move by oblique motion from a major seventh, one of the most<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; or acute dissonances, to an octave, a pure or &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>concord.</p><p>However, we might also treasure a variety of intermediate shadings<br/>between JI and MI, with various &quot;rules&quot; or preferences as to<br/>transitions or juxtapositions. For example, 16th-century European<br/>counterpoint rules actually treat thirds and sixths, classed as<br/>&quot;imperfect concords,&quot; as the most favored sounds, with rules which<br/>avoid or &quot;cushion&quot; extreme contrasts. A general guideline for<br/>significant sonorities is to move from discord to imperfect concord,<br/>and from there in two-voice progressions to perfect concord, so that<br/>the favored 13th-14th century move by stepwise contrary motion from a<br/>minor seventh to a fifth is excluded as a prominent progression.<br/>Rather the seventh must be prepared as a suspension, moderating its<br/>impact, and normally in a cadential progression it resolves down<br/>stepwise to the major sixth, an imperfect concord, which might then<br/>expand to the perfect concord of the octave.</p><p>These patterns apply for other styles, for example in the 20th<br/>century, where the &quot;rules&quot; may be less clearly defined, but a variety<br/>of intervals and levels of clarity or tension is clearly sought and<br/>achieved. Ludmila Ulehla has drawn graphs of consonance/dissonance in<br/>compositions of different periods, seeking to map out the relevant<br/>categories of sonorities according to the rules and practices of each<br/>period. While we&apos;re speaking here of conventional interval categories<br/>and the sonorities they form in a given style, the same approach could<br/>be applied to harmonic entropy.</p><p>&gt; You asked, &quot;What might a contour map look like?&quot;</p><p>&gt; Might it look like a Harmonic Entropy curve, such as one of these<br/>&gt; three, made for you by Paul Erlich?<br/>&gt; [150]<a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/margo.gif">/tuning/files/dyadic/margo.gif</a><br/>&gt; [151]<a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/margo2.gif">/tuning/files/dyadic/margo2.gif</a><br/>&gt; [152]<a href="/tuning/files/dyadic/margo3.gif">/tuning/files/dyadic/margo3.gif</a></p><p>Ah, yes, I remember that we discussed these around 2002, with George<br/>getting involved in the dialogue.</p><p>Anyway, I feel like apologizing for thinking out loud at this length,<br/>but a lesson might be that harmonic entropy as conveniently reflected<br/>in many regions by the noble mediant could indeed be approached from a<br/>dynamic, graduated, and stylistically flexible standpoint. It&apos;s one<br/>measuring tool, and doesn&apos;t have to be prescriptive, but can give us<br/>interesting descriptions of practice, sometimes with results not so<br/>obvious.</p><p>What I&apos;d say is: let&apos;s think in terms of a continuum where JI, MI, and<br/>all the intermediate nuances are open, and serve as possible goals<br/>both of tuning design and actual compositions or improvisations.</p><p>The question is not just optimizing intervals at one or two points or<br/>regions on the JI-MI scale, necessarily, but sometimes getting a<br/>motley assortment of shadings and degrees. In actual music, such<br/>tunings might support various preferences for the successions,<br/>transitions, or juxtapositions of different entropy levels -- by<br/>calculation, by habitual and at least partly unformulated intuition,<br/>or even by chance in an unequal temperament or the like (with the<br/>element of calculation possibly coming in the choice of a temperament<br/>which routinely produces a variety of colors even if the performer is<br/>concentrating on other things).</p><p>In short, while I&apos;m sure we&apos;d agree that harmonic entropy is not a<br/>theory of tuning or composition, I suspect we&apos;d also agree that it can<br/>greatly enrich and enhance such theories.</p><p>&gt; -- Dave Keenan</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77493 href="#77493">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2008 3:22:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For example, consider the noble mediant of 12:7-7:4 at 943 cents.

Here I would guess that our comments are coming from<br/>rather different musical frames of reference. My first reaction to<br/>your reference to 8:5 and 9:5 was: &quot;But that&apos;s from a large minor<br/>sixth to a large minor seventh, with lots of categories between,<br/>presumably including some kind of major sixth, and maybe a neutral<br/>sixth also.&quot;</p><p>However, if you are thinking literally of a &quot;harmonic series&quot; --<br/>i.e. 5:6:7:8:9..., then your comment would, of course, hold.</p><p>For me, the idea of a middle or &quot;interseptimal&quot; ground between 12:7<br/>and 7:4 can apply in two situations. The first is in tuning systems<br/>like 14-EDO, 24-EDO or 29-EDO (or 19-EDO) where there isn&apos;t any close<br/>representation of 12:7 or 7:4, but an intriguingly intermediate size<br/>that might play a role comparable to either. The purpose of using such<br/>a system wouldn&apos;t be to get accurate septimal ratios, but precisely to<br/>get interseptimal ones, whether we speak of integer ratios as<br/>landmarks like 19:11 or 26:15, or simply sizes in cents in the 940-960<br/>zone, more or less.</p><p>The other situation is where we have some fairly close septimal<br/>representations plus intermediate intervals as well: this happens in<br/>Zest-24. Here&apos;s an article on a 19-note subset of this temperament<br/>emulating a septimal JI (2-3-7-9) matrix, with fairly close<br/>representations of 12:7 or 7:4 in some positions, and intermediate<br/>ones like 946 or 950 cents in others:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;  According to my &quot;wrong&quot; method, that&apos;s at 942.517 cents, ie, might<br/>&gt;  as well be the same thing as your example above. But I find my<br/>&gt;  explanation simpler.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that I don&apos;t think there is any one &quot;right&quot; or<br/>&quot;wrong&quot; method. The noble mediant is merely one way to approach the<br/>problem. I would consider seeing what interval sounds best for your<br/>purposes as the right way.</p><p>&gt;  Either way, we get the inversion of the &quot;consant interval&quot; of Ibn<br/>&gt;  Sin, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s sheer coincidence. Note that the<br/>&gt;  interval you give above is even closer to Ibn Sin&apos;s than mine is, a<br/>&gt;  tiny fraction of a cent rather than .9 cents. I believe that we are<br/>&gt;  dealing with a fuzzy region a cent or two wide.</p><p>Actually I&apos;d suspect we&apos;re seeking a convenient number as a guide to<br/>something notably fuzzy. Things like variations of timbre are going to<br/>have an effect also, whether subtle or dramatic.</p><p>&gt;  I also believe that a great big catalog of these kinds of intervals<br/>&gt;  has been around for centuries and more, for no less than three<br/>&gt;  intervals I&apos;ve identified as &quot;shadows&quot; have showed up in the Scala<br/>&gt;  archives or on Gann&apos;s nifty anatomy of an octave page labelled<br/>&gt;  &quot;Zalzal&quot; or &quot;Avicenna&quot;.</p><p>The file octave.txt -- nifty, I&apos;d say also! -- shows a ratio of<br/>196/169 or 256.596 cents which is listed as an interval deemed<br/>&quot;consonant&quot; by Ibn Sina (or in Latin Europe, Avicenna).

I&apos;ll address<br/>&gt; your points one at a time:</p><p>Hello, Mike, and thank you for joining this thread. You raise some<br/>questions about the status of 5:4 in medieval European music where, as<br/>a medievalist, I&apos;d like to flesh things out a bit. Also, while no one<br/>today has audio tapes with 13th-14th century performances on them, I<br/>can also share some very concrete experience about some of my own<br/>20th-21st century tuning systems and practices have been interpreted<br/>on this list. My challenge is to keep this reasonably concise, and<br/>reasonably &quot;transparent&quot; (as much as I love complex intervals)!</p><p>&gt; Another idea related to this one that that of describing intervals<br/>&gt; in terms of &quot;depth;&quot; that is, 3/2 is of shallow depth, that 5/4 is<br/>&gt; &quot;deeper,&quot; etc. It&apos;s sort of synesthetically how I perceive intervals<br/>&gt; anyway. I intuitively feel the process as being analogous to the<br/>&gt; visual processing in the brain whereas two separate left/right<br/>&gt; images are combined to make a 3d picture. Intervals high in harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy are simply harder to place, depth-wise - it&apos;s harder for the<br/>&gt; brain to orient itself and get the depth of 9/11 than it is to get<br/>&gt; the depth of 3/2, for example.</p><p>This is an evocative metaphor, &quot;depth/shallowness,&quot; and the main<br/>possible complication is that we&apos;re already speaking of &quot;valleys&quot; for<br/>simple intervals and &quot;plateaus&quot; or &quot;peaks&quot; for complex ones, not a<br/>usage that I necessarily would have originated, but one which is<br/>there. Some terms can have different and even &quot;opposite&quot; meanings --<br/>&quot;to sanction&quot; as either &quot;to authorize&quot; or &quot;to penalize&quot; -- so that<br/>might not be a bar to a description I like. However, I&apos;m not sure that<br/>&quot;shallowness&quot; is the term for what I feel in a fifth, the most complex<br/>kind of stable concord in lots of world musics (including medieval<br/>European) and in much of my own. Maybe I&apos;d speak of a &quot;depth of<br/>clarity&quot; for the fifth and a &quot;depth of intricacy&quot; for more complex<br/>intervals. This could be &quot;clarity/intricacy&quot; for short.</p><p>&gt; Dave pointed out that the size of that S parameter determines<br/>&gt; whether or not there is a valley at 9/11... So that&apos;s another<br/>&gt; concern when it comes to labeling these things. For one listener,<br/>&gt; they might well have a valley there (meaning they have succeeded in<br/>&gt; perceiving the depth of that interval). Another listener who is much<br/>&gt; more used to 6/5 and 5/4 might only hear it as an out of tune,<br/>&gt; multistable version of both of them (aka they&apos;d have a valley).</p><p>May I suggest that we make a vital distinction by using &quot;valley&quot; for<br/>an interval deemed to be acoustically an entropic minimum, or ratio of<br/>&quot;simplicity&quot;: a fact of physics rather than style. The term &quot;oasis&quot;<br/>might nicely express an interval considered pleasant and congenial in<br/>a given cultural tradition or style, whether stable or mildly<br/>unstable, and whether it happens or not to be an entropic valley.</p><p>Thus in a 21st-century neomedieval style, 4:3 and 3:2 are both<br/>entropic valleys and stylistically stable oases, as is the complete<br/>three-voice concord 2:3:4; while 4:6:9 or 6:8:9 are valleys that serve<br/>as stylistically unstable but relatively blending and very pleasant<br/>oases. Septimal intervals such as 7:6, 9:7, and 7:4 are likewise<br/>valleys serving as mildly unstable oases -- as are 13:11 and 14:11,<br/>not necessarily entropic valleys. Neutral thirds in the range of<br/>around 330-372 cents are also important, whether as special elements<br/>of color or as basic elements of styles with a Near Eastern flavor:<br/>while sizes around the possible 11:9 valley are common, especially<br/>favored mildly unstable oases are around 17:14 and 21:17, the former<br/>at least quite possibly closer to a peak than a valley.</p><p>Note that 5:4 simply isn&apos;t important to me in most neomedieval<br/>styles. It might be essentially absent from a system (e.g. 17-EDO or<br/>George Secor&apos;s brilliant well-tempered variation, 17-WT), or be<br/>approximated in a few exotic positions of a 24-note system such as<br/>Peppermint, or be very closely represented in the diminished fourths<br/>of a medieval or later Pythagorean tuning, or appear at many locations<br/>as a primary feature of the tuning, as in a modified meantone used for<br/>neomedieval purposes.</p><p>George Secor and I have both written extensively about modern styles<br/>(neomedieval and otherwise) in systems such as 17-EDO or 17-WT where<br/>there are no close counterparts of 5:4 or 6:5, Here are links to his<br/>article appearing in _Xenharmonikon_ 18, followed by a version of mine:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf">http://xenharmony.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/17puzzle.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Secor_17-WT_draft.zip</a>&gt;</p><p>George&apos;s perspectives and insights are absolutely vital to this<br/>discussion. While I&apos;ve been involved with medieval and neomedieval<br/>music for 40 years, he approaches it from another musical viewpoint,<br/>based on a vastly greater knowledge of tuning systems than mine, with<br/>great artistic discernment and empathy.</p><p>[On my proposed concepts of &quot;transparency/translucency&quot; and<br/>&quot;smoothness/friction&quot;]</p><p>&gt; I agree with the concept behind it. Also, I would say we can use any<br/>&gt; terms at all as long as they&apos;re not used to make statements such as<br/>&gt; that 11/9 absolutely IS a peak of harmonic entropy. After all, 5/4<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t a harmonic entropy valley back in early western music. Or<br/>&gt; maybe it was, and it was a purely cognitive and intellectual limit<br/>&gt; that musicians of that age placed on themselves - that they<br/>&gt; &quot;pretended&quot; or &quot;feared&quot; that it was a dissonance. We may never know.</p><p>Here I&apos;d say, strictly speaking  that 5:4 is a &quot;harmonic entropy valley&quot;<br/>under the laws of physics in any time or place, but it isn&apos;t evidently<br/>a stylistic oasis in many medieval or 21st-century neomedieval styles,<br/>the latter of which I can attest at first hand, or in a variety of<br/>other world musics which happen to focus on other intervals or regions.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t mean that I &quot;fear&quot; 5:4, or &quot;pretend&quot; that it&apos;s not an<br/>acoustical valley, and indeed an oasis in other styles including those<br/>of the late 15th to early 17th centuries in Europe that I also<br/>practice. Rather it may mean that the interval doesn&apos;t seem so central<br/>to a given style, whether or not it happens to be present in the<br/>tuning system at hand -- with modified meantone used for neomedieval<br/>idioms where the regular meantone thirds are absent or rare as a<br/>dramatic illustration.</p><p>As to &quot;pretending&quot; and &quot;fearing,&quot; I would strongly urge that we<br/>approach the fact that a given style happens not to regard or use a<br/>given entropic valley as an oasis in other terms.</p><p>In most 13th-14th century styles of Continental Europe, or similar<br/>neomedieval styles today, 5:4 is not an oasis -- and all thirds, of<br/>course, are definitely unstable, although relatively blending. For<br/>more on historical practice and theory. Note that in these documents<br/>synbols like 8/5 or 5/4 mean figured bass notation for sonorities like an<br/>octave and fifth, or fifth and fourth, above the lowest note, rather than<br/>tuning ratios, something I quickly learned could cause misunderstandings<br/>among people for whom the latter reading is more common!</p><p>          &lt;<a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a>&gt;<br/>          &lt;<a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Similarly, the dauntless Nicola Vicentino in 1555 explores every<br/>interval in a 31-note meantone circle around 1/4-comma or 31-EDO, and<br/>finds neutral thirds for which he gives an approximate ratio of 11:9 as<br/>very pleasant, but intervals evidently near 7:6 and 7:6 as rather on<br/>the dissonant side, and mostly to be &quot;put aside.&quot; During Bach&apos;s early<br/>childhood, Christiaan Huygens celebrated 7:6 and 7:4 as concords and<br/>special adornments of such a 31-note cycle, but I doubt that any close<br/>equivalents occurred in Bach&apos;s typical circulating tunings -- let<br/>alone the neutral thirds favored by Vicentino and already embraced as<br/>a basic feature of Near Eastern styles for at least about a millennium<br/>(starting with Zalzal in the 8th century).</p><p>To make some of these points more concrete, here is a piece in a<br/>21st-century tuning system:</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>We have the 3:2 and 4:3 valleys as prominent stable oases, and various<br/>sizes for unstable intervals such as seconds, thirds, sixths, and<br/>sevenths, including such relatively blending oases as 7:6 and 7:4.</p><p>Here&apos;s another piece in the same 12-note tuning system:</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>In the style based largely on a Manneristic meantone idiom around<br/>1600, 5:4 is, of course, a stable oasis. As a modern libery which<br/>might reflect _some_ adventurous period trends, there are touches of<br/>septimal color, and also the use of a major sixth sonority with Eb-G-C<br/>(0-408-913 cents in this modified meantone tuning) in a cadential<br/>context where it leads to a conventional 4-3 suspension and<br/>resolution.</p><p>Here is another piece in a 24-note expansion of this system:</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>In this piece inspired by Persian music, the 3:2 and 4:3 valleys are<br/>vital oases, and neutral thirds are a basic element -- notably absent<br/>from the previous two pieces! Also some septimal valleys occur as<br/>oases, while 5:4 is unimportant, and if present would occur more or<br/>less by accident.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve kept it under 200 lines, at least. Of course, we can<br/>discuss medieval theory and practice more, as well as interesting<br/>variant views (e.g. Walter Odington on 5:4 and 6:5 around 1300, who<br/>may be reflecting a lot of English style and practice; Vicentino on<br/>11:9; Huygens and later Euler on 7:6 and 7:4).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter#<a href="http://calweb.com">calweb.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=77833 href="#77833">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2008 3:17:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Indeed, the neutral thirds of Maqam music are more diversified than<br/>&gt; the ratio 11:9 can encompass. As far as I can tell, middle second<br/>&gt; intervals roam the mujannab zone between 14:13 and 11:10. This is a<br/>&gt; region 37 cents wide. Then again, it is possible to broaden the zone<br/>&gt; and take 15:14 and 10:9 as the extremes. In that case, we acquire a<br/>&gt; zone that is 63 cents wide!</p><p>Dear Oz (and Dave, and all),</p><p>Thank you for these remarks so nicely summing up the flexibility of<br/>intonation in Maqam music, which I have relished as someone seeking<br/>an appreciation of this high art.

In a paper to which I am now<br/>making some small corrections and revisions with many thanks to Dave,<br/>I suggest a slightly wider range of about 125-170 cents, which I<br/>recall that Farhat has suggested in his study of Persian Dastgah<br/>music.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>At times, I may use 121/122 or 171/172 cents in the place of a neutral<br/>second, and the effect can approximate that of a neutral second -- for<br/>example, in certain polyphonic progressions which are, of course,<br/>outside the scope of traditional Maqam or Dastgah music. However, as I<br/>have learned, to say that an interval around 170 cents has a generally<br/>&quot;neutral effect,&quot; and that it aptly and smoothly fits a given Maqam<br/>for a listener who speaks this musical language as a native, may be<br/>two quite different things!</p><p>&gt; I conjecture that high prime limit and relatively simple integer<br/>&gt; ratios such as 14:13, 27:25, 13:12, 12:11, 35:32, 11:10, 54:49 are<br/>&gt; at play. Then again, instead of middle seconds, we might be looking<br/>&gt; at neutral thirds, in which case, the performer could be searching<br/>&gt; for 17:14, 39:32, 11:9, 27:22, 16:13, 21:17 and 31:25.</p><p>Please let me warmly agree that these are evocative ratios. Thinking<br/>of a neutral third as a major second somewhere around 9:8 plus some<br/>kind of neutral second is one approach. Another, which Dan Stearns<br/>interestingly suggested in a recent post, is to take the 8-step<br/>interval of 29-EDO at 331 cents as a very small neutral third at the<br/>lower end of the range (maybe 23:19 or, more classically, 63:52). I<br/>would say likewise that 9/29 octave or 372 cents, a virtually exact<br/>realization of your 31:25, is at about the upper end of the range.</p><p>In fact, your ratios yield what I would consider a handy map of the<br/>region, to which I&apos;ll add one ratio for symmetry, 75:62 at the lower<br/>boundary (which could also be 98:81, or 4:3 less the classic 54:49<br/>which Scala calls &quot;Zalzal&apos;s mujannab,&quot; in which case the upper<br/>boundary could be 243:196, or 9:8 plus 54:49, a tiny superparticular<br/>difference of 6076:6075):</p><p>         small or                                   large<br/>        supraminor            central            or submajor<br/>     |---------------|------------------------|---------------|<br/>   75:62   17:14   39:32   11:9     27:22   16:13   21:17   31:25<br/>    330     336     342     347      355     360*    366     372</p><p>       *16:13 is actually about 359.47 cents, but I have<br/>        rounded upward to 360 cents so as to make 39:32<br/>        and 16:13 add up to a rounded 702 cents.</p><p>It would seem that often central neutral thirds are typical of Maqam<br/>music, while the small and large or supraminor/submajor sizes are<br/>often preferred in Dastgah music. It would interesting to ask whether<br/>this fits with your own impressions of the music, and how the various<br/>regional variations of these styles may have evolved, given the rich<br/>cross-pollination and common elements for these manifestations of the<br/>Islamic tradition in the Near East.</p><p>If one seeks historical precedents, then Zalzal&apos;s scale according to<br/>al-Farabius gives us a subtle 27:22-11:9 division of the fifth. I seem<br/>to recall that Ibn Sina (or Avicenna in Latin Europe) placed Zalzal&apos;s<br/>wosta fret at around 39:32; and, of course, 13:12 is a common ratio in<br/>the medieval Islamic era, which would yield 39:32 when added to 9:8 or<br/>16:13 when subtracted from 4:3. His wonderful scale based on a division<br/>of a 7:6 third into 14:13:12 also has supraminor thirds at 63:52 or<br/>332 cents, and submajor thirds at 26:21 or 369 cents, equal to 9:8<br/>plus 14:13 or 4:3 less 14:13.</p><p>When I shared with George Secor my taste for 17:14 and 21:17, he<br/>pointed out to me that 14:17:21 is actually the simplest neutral third<br/>division of the fifth; either 32:39:48 or 18:22:27 requires a higher<br/>odd-limit.</p><p>&gt; So many ratios imply the necessity to temper pitches and represent<br/>&gt; diverse middle seconds as well as neutral thirds with few, yet,<br/>&gt; variagated microtones that are reasonably spaced. That is how I<br/>&gt; arrived at 79 MOS 159-tET. Check out page 95 of my doctorate<br/>&gt; dissertation. There, you will see how the 79-tone tuning<br/>&gt; approximates many RI intervals.</p><p>Oz, this is truly a brilliant system, both the way in which pure 3:2<br/>fifths and 4:3 fourths are combined with temperament, and the array of<br/>delicious flavors generated.</p><p>Curiously, in the kinds of polyphonic styles where I use neutral<br/>thirds toward with smaller minor or larger major thirds, the<br/>contrapuntal rules for their use are rather alike. Here _all_ thirds<br/>are relatively blending but unstable, or &quot;quasi-consonant&quot; as you well<br/>put it -- the neutral ones, but major and minor also! And all types of<br/>thirds may vary in flavor over a wide range. In fact, I might gives<br/>ranges of about 254-300 for minor; 330-372 for neutral; and 408-442<br/>for major. Note that in this kind of style, the areas immediately<br/>around 6:5 and 5:4 are less typical -- although, as we have noted,<br/>they are often important in varieties of Maqam music. However, the<br/>simple ratio or &quot;valley&quot; of 7:6 often figures very prominently.</p><p>In directed progressions, a general guideline is that a minor or<br/>supraminor (small neutral) third will often resolve to a unison, and<br/>submajor (large neutral) or major third to a fifth, one voice moving<br/>by a major second and the other by a semitone or small neutral<br/>second. The central neutral range of thirds has a special quality<br/>because in resolving to either a unison or a fifth, one voice<br/>typically moves by a major second and the other by a central neutral<br/>second rather different from either a tone or a semitone.</p><p>If you are curious, here is an article about a 19-note tempered<br/>system based on two JI tunings by Gene Ward Smith for Aaron<br/>Johnson. While the main idea is to get lots of minor thirds within<br/>about 20 cents of 7:6, maybe the most important simple ratio after 3:2<br/>and 4:3, there are lots of neutral flavors also, although not ones<br/>necessarily fitting any standard scheme of Maqamat or Dastgah-ha. It<br/>mibht be interesting, however, as example of flexible tuning for<br/>thirds (minor, neutral, and major).</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77836 href="#77836">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2008 4:08:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, all.</p><p>Mike&apos;s comment in a related dialogue the two of us are<br/>having moved me to offer some comments here about some very<br/>basic questions on the direction for harmonic entropy theory<br/>to go. The question of the &quot;depth&quot; of an interval, as he terms<br/>it, is to me an outstanding example of how what we may need<br/>here is a theory of relativity, even if that outside of<br/>&quot;harmonic entropy proper.&quot;</p><p>Specifically, I was reflecting on Mike&apos;s comparison of the<br/>&quot;depth&quot; -- which might here mean &quot;richness&quot; or possibly<br/>&quot;intricacy&quot; -- of an interval such as 3:2 or 5:4.</p><p>This brings me to something I was vividly aware of for about<br/>three decades before I got involved in our wonderful world of<br/>alternative tunings.</p><p>To me, a 3:2 fifth or complete 2:3:4 was at once a simple concord,<br/>or &quot;valley,&quot; and a very rich sonority. In medieval European music,<br/>of course, the latter is a complete stable sonority, the goal of<br/>motion and the standard of a &quot;perfect&quot; sound. And so it still is.</p><p>However, when immersed in the different universe of 16th-century<br/>European sound where 4:5:6 is a complete stable concord -- or,<br/>more aptly spaced, something like 2:3:4:5 or 2:4:5:6, to put<br/>Zarlino&apos;s or Morley&apos;s suggestions into frequency ratio form --<br/>2:3:4 or the common four-voice variation of 1:2:3:4 can sound<br/>quite &quot;sparse&quot; and a bit austere -- radically different from<br/>2:3:4 or 1:2:3 in a 13th-14th century setting!</p><p>Long before getting wrapped up in the fine points of ratios,<br/>I had a vivid experience in college. I have composed a simple<br/>three-voice piece in a style around 1200, and was fortunate<br/>enough to find three other students ready to try singing it.<br/>They reached the end of the first phrase, where I had written<br/>the sonority of a fifth with two voices converging on a unison.<br/>However, two of them arrived at the fifth and the other at<br/>a major third above the lowest voice -- especially likely in<br/>reading at sight. I&apos;m not sure how that major third was tuned,<br/>but I vividly felt how an unstable third simply was &quot;out of<br/>place&quot; there to my ears -- but obviously quite natural to<br/>theirs. Since a major third would have been equally natural<br/>to me in a Renaissance style, this was a matter of contextual<br/>grammar rather than &quot;entropy&quot; in the abstract.</p><p>Thus, to borrow Mike&apos;s term, I would say that a 3:2 fifth or<br/>2:3:4 sonority has greater &quot;depth&quot; -- or maybe better yet,<br/>given his binocular vision analogy, &quot;dimension&quot; -- in a medieval<br/>than in a Renaissance context.</p><p>Might the different modes of seeing with cones (day vision) and rods<br/>(night vision) provide an analogy for shifting between styles. When one&apos;s<br/>eyes are dark-adapted physically and biochemically, a level of light<br/>normally routine can be painfully bright, as well as undoing the<br/>adaptation -- thus the careful rules of etiquette for amateur<br/>astronomical gatherings governing automobile lights and even small<br/>torches or flashlights.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure where these metaphors might lead us, but the situational<br/>perception of entropy in context, if that&apos;s not an oxymoron, or if it<br/>_is_ the kind of oxymoron to provoke further thought, might be one<br/>direction to consider.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77838 href="#77838">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2008 7:25:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Tom, Brad, Johnny, and all,</p><p>Thank you for some most stimulating discussions which give much to<br/>ponder, combined with some poetic verbal music. Tom, your vivid<br/>metaphor for meantone has led me to the title &quot;Alternative Boulevards&quot;<br/>for some musical commentaries I plan to write, with full credit to you<br/>for that title.</p><p>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_77237.html#77655">/tuning/topicId_77237.html#77655</a>&gt;</p><p>One thing I&apos;ve found over the years is that we tend to be at our best<br/>when campaigning positively, whether it&apos;s describing the special<br/>charms of 17th-century meantone; or the genius of Werckmeister and his<br/>scheme of well-temperaments; or the possibilities of a different kind<br/>of tuning circle like Sorge&apos;s for Bach&apos;s music. The secret is that<br/>traffic on one artistic avenue need not collide with that on another:<br/>there&apos;s enough space for different tastes. And yes, Zarlino compares<br/>an appreciation of good counterpoint with an informed taste for the<br/>right kind of healthy food, so I guess &quot;taste&quot; is a period concept.</p><p>As someone who typically approaches meantone (regular or modified)<br/>from a 16th-century to early 17th-century perspective, maybe my most<br/>helpful substantive contribution to this discussion would be to<br/>emphasize the vast range of epochs, places, and styles you are<br/>discussing and sometimes rather pointedly debating. Since Frescobaldi<br/>and the period around 1600 has been raised, I would emphasize one<br/>specific point that becomes less applicable as we move into the realm,<br/>still very broad, that you seem mainly to be focusing on.</p><p>In the era around 1600, and toward mid-century too, modes or &quot;tones&quot;<br/>are still a vital focus of practice, as naturally I would emphasize<br/>since it happens to be my main focus in lots of musicmaking &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>For example, I once heard what sounded like a cadence on E with an<br/>ascending rather than descending semitone in an opera of Monteverdi as<br/>a kind of rhetorical figure going outside the usual nature of<br/>Phrygian. In another words, what I heard as D# seemed to me &quot;exotic&quot;<br/>-- a striking modern gesture, and just what we would expect from this<br/>composer, of course!</p><p>Does thinking in terms of 12 modes give me a different perspective on<br/>meantone than people oriented mainly to major/minor -- and would<br/>people in the early 17th century, or some of them, have heard<br/>Monteverdi&apos;s cadence as I did? Whatever, I&apos;d say that not only the<br/>range of consonance/dissonance which you have pointed out, Tom, but<br/>the variety of modes, makes either a regular or modified meantone in<br/>12 or more notes seem quite spacious.</p><p>As to there being no recordings from the period, that is true -- and<br/>would also be true for an organist or harpsichordist of that time in<br/>Sicily considering how to read and realize a piece of Monteverdi or<br/>Frescobaldi without the benefit of a tape or CD hot from Mantua or<br/>Rome. A notated piece of music in score, part-books, or whatever, of<br/>course, is itself a kind of document -- so then, as now, inference and<br/>interpretation can&apos;t be avoided. And it&apos;s fun.</p><p>Debates might be more affable if we focus on the debates in that era,<br/>sometimes with both sides represented. Thus Jean Denis in 1643 and<br/>1650 is out to stop the &quot;black marketeering&quot; of using augmented or<br/>diminished meantone intervals in place of the &quot;proper&quot; ones: an<br/>organist must on no account make modal transpositions like that of the<br/>First Tone (more or less D Dorian) to F -- with F-G# as the third!<br/>Don&apos;t let choristers who wish to &quot;sing at their convenience&quot; steer you<br/>to such a result! Otherwise, people will not only consider your<br/>otherwise most skillful playing as incompetent, but will conclude that<br/>you cannot keep the instrument in tune.</p><p>However, Huygens in 1691 finds 7/6, along with 7/4, a prize jewel of<br/>the 31-note cycle (1/4-comma or 31-EDO), and the comments in the<br/>French literature about how people relish &quot;transposed modes&quot; (i.e. in<br/>meantone, regular or modified) indicate that Denis may not have been<br/>voicing a universal view for either the earlier or later part of the<br/>century. Of course, as Denis would likely acknowledge, those augmented<br/>and diminished intervals themselves are part of the standard idiom: he<br/>may have decrying the tendency of people to stumble into them<br/>unawares, possibly giving us a hint that people were nevertheless<br/>doing it and sometimes liking it (with or without help from choristers<br/>asking a keyboardist with 12 notes per octave to &quot;play at their<br/>convenience&quot;).</p><p>In short, as one following and favoring a modal kind of meantone<br/>music, I want that diesis, the delightful disparity of major and minor<br/>semitones, and those colorful augmented and diminished intervals.<br/>However, far be it from me to assume that people moving into a tonal<br/>universe in the decades around 1700 would have these same priorities,<br/>although the discussions of &quot;transposed modes&quot; in French theory<br/>suggest that the older perspectives on modality and meantone still<br/>exerted a certain traction.</p><p>At the same time, I must acknowledge a radical historical<br/>discontinuity or indeed &quot;space warp&quot; between any likely 17th-century<br/>perspective on modified meantone (mentioned by Praetorius) and mine.<br/>For &quot;12-note circulation,&quot; all I need to do is tune F-C# in a regular<br/>1/4-comma or 2/7-comma or the like and place the other three notes so<br/>as share out the harmonic excess equally among the remaining four<br/>fifths -- to paraphrase Brad, &quot;Average it out, sister!&quot;</p><p>The reason for this is that Tom&apos;s &quot;black market&quot; in those once not so<br/>prestigious neighbhorhoods has become Saks Fifth Avenue, an<br/>establishment of the most respectable kind with beautiful neo-Gothic<br/>architecture inspired, however inexactly, by Marchettus and Machaut<br/>and the usual 14th-century suspects, where major thirds are indeed<br/>broad and expansive avenues leading to a fifth.</p><p>&quot;Two just 5:4 thirds plus a just 9:7 third happily come quite<br/>close to a 2:1 octave, with 2/7-comma nicely splitting the difference&quot;<br/>may be a precept of 21st-century &quot;urban planning,&quot; but 16th-17th<br/>century theory it&apos;s not.</p><p>Getting back to the main dialogue, however, one thing should grace and<br/>temper our discussion: an awareness that musicians then and now can<br/>differ in taste, and, in short, &quot;hear things differently.&quot; Could the<br/>debate about Werckmeister-Neidhardt-Sorge be analogous to arguing<br/>whether a keyboard piece around 1600 was conceived for 1/4-comma,<br/>2/7-comma, or 1/5-comma meantone? In other words, rather than seeking<br/>the &quot;correct&quot; practice for a given period, we&apos;re canvassing the<br/>diverse ways a piece could been and quite likely was played, and<br/>exploring the question of which we like best, and why.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77852 href="#77852">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2008 11:41:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Andreas,</p><p>Thank you for posting your temperament with one wide fifth based on<br/>complex integer ratios, a technique that fascinates me, and which I<br/>have used in rather different stylistic settings.</p><p>There is one small revision that might appeal to me, and I would be<br/>very curious as to your opinion on what I might propose.</p><p>Looking at the sizes of fifths, I noticed that at D-A there is a fifth<br/>considerably narrower than any other, at only about 694.1 cents, or<br/>almost 8 cents smaller than pure, with a ratio of 884/592.

Here I would guess that our comments are coming from<br/>&gt; rather different musical frames of reference. My first reaction to<br/>&gt; your reference to 8:5 and 9:5 was: &quot;But that&apos;s from a large minor<br/>&gt; sixth to a large minor seventh, with lots of categories between,<br/>&gt; presumably including some kind of major sixth, and maybe a neutral<br/>&gt; sixth also.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, if you are thinking literally of a &quot;harmonic series&quot; --<br/>&gt; i.e. 5:6:7:8:9..., then your comment would, of course, hold.</p><p>Yes, exactly. I think the &quot;first families&quot; are always going to be<br/>direct descendants and relatives of the audible harmonic series. Even<br/>in heavily beating tunings, the harmonic series is the reference<br/>structure. There is no aesthetic judgement here of course. Intervals<br/>directly derived from the harmonic series may be exactly what someone<br/>does NOT desire, and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, the idea of a middle or &quot;interseptimal&quot; ground between 12:7<br/>&gt; and 7:4 can apply in two situations. The first is in tuning systems<br/>&gt; like 14-EDO, 24-EDO or 29-EDO (or 19-EDO) where there isn&apos;t any<br/>close<br/>&gt; representation of 12:7 or 7:4, but an intriguingly intermediate<br/>size<br/>&gt; that might play a role comparable to either. The purpose of using<br/>such<br/>&gt; a system wouldn&apos;t be to get accurate septimal ratios, but<br/>precisely to<br/>&gt; get interseptimal ones, whether we speak of integer ratios as<br/>&gt; landmarks like 19:11 or 26:15, or simply sizes in cents in the 940-<br/>960<br/>&gt; zone, more or less.</p><p>Yes- for example, I remember mentioning to you a 23-o and u- tonality<br/>based 17 tone tuning or tetrachord. If we were for example to take<br/>one of your tunings in the Scala archive which is &quot;elevensy&quot; with a<br/>14/11 for example rather than the 23/18 I had chosen, we could strike<br/>a maximally both-and-neither &quot;floating&quot; tuning between the two by<br/>using a number of different classical means, including the golden<br/>section.</p><p>Each would have its own subtly different character and cohesiveness-<br/>the arithmetic mean would strike a mean which subsumes both of the<br/>original intervals into a shared harmonic series so to speak, etc.</p><p>Oops gotta run, child calling...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other situation is where we have some fairly close septimal<br/>&gt; representations plus intermediate intervals as well: this happens<br/>in<br/>&gt; Zest-24. Here&apos;s an article on a 19-note subset of this temperament<br/>&gt; emulating a septimal JI (2-3-7-9) matrix, with fairly close<br/>&gt; representations of 12:7 or 7:4 in some positions, and intermediate<br/>&gt; ones like 946 or 950 cents in others:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  According to my &quot;wrong&quot; method, that&apos;s at 942.517 cents, ie,<br/>might<br/>&gt; &gt;  as well be the same thing as your example above. But I find my<br/>&gt; &gt;  explanation simpler.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me emphasize that I don&apos;t think there is any one<br/>&quot;right&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;wrong&quot; method. The noble mediant is merely one way to approach the<br/>&gt; problem. I would consider seeing what interval sounds best for your<br/>&gt; purposes as the right way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Either way, we get the inversion of the &quot;consant interval&quot; of<br/>Ibn<br/>&gt; &gt;  Sin, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s sheer coincidence. Note that the<br/>&gt; &gt;  interval you give above is even closer to Ibn Sin&apos;s than mine<br/>is, a<br/>&gt; &gt;  tiny fraction of a cent rather than .9 cents. I believe that we<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt;  dealing with a fuzzy region a cent or two wide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually I&apos;d suspect we&apos;re seeking a convenient number as a guide<br/>to<br/>&gt; something notably fuzzy. Things like variations of timbre are<br/>going to<br/>&gt; have an effect also, whether subtle or dramatic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  I also believe that a great big catalog of these kinds of<br/>intervals<br/>&gt; &gt;  has been around for centuries and more, for no less than three<br/>&gt; &gt;  intervals I&apos;ve identified as &quot;shadows&quot; have showed up in the<br/>Scala<br/>&gt; &gt;  archives or on Gann&apos;s nifty anatomy of an octave page labelled<br/>&gt; &gt;  &quot;Zalzal&quot; or &quot;Avicenna&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The file octave.txt -- nifty, I&apos;d say also! -- shows a ratio of<br/>&gt; 196/169 or 256.596 cents which is listed as an interval deemed<br/>&gt; &quot;consonant&quot; by Ibn Sina (or in Latin Europe, Avicenna). This is<br/>&gt; interesting, and I&apos;d agree with this great philosopher and music<br/>&gt; theorist in his appraisal made something like a millennium ago.<br/>I&apos;d be<br/>&gt; interested to know his context for this interval. It is very close<br/>&gt; also to 297/256, or 257.182 cents. Thanks to Kyle Gann for making<br/>that<br/>&gt; page &quot;Anatomy of an Octave&quot; available, and to you for reminding me<br/>of<br/>&gt; how much fun I&apos;ve had with that list of intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ibn Sina also described a scale with simple septimal ratios, which<br/>&gt; George Secor and I discussed in our exploration of his 17-WT<br/>tuning,<br/>&gt; which has some nice approximations:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 14/13 7/6 4/3 3/2 21/13 7/4 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is in the Scala archive as avicenna_diat.scl.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=77855 href="#77855">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2008 5:15:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>First, let me thank you for bringing to my attention your well-prepared article titled &quot;Regions of the Interval Spectrum&quot;. I am glad to observe that the chapters on neutral intervals agree with my views on Maqam music theory. Please note, that 14:13 is also given by Urmavi as the approximation to all middle melodic (lahni) intervals (supraminor seconds) in his treatise (Risale al-Sharafiyyah).</p><p>I think the theory of Maqam music and other &quot;ethnic&quot; genres around the world are much neglected by the alternative tuning list community. Most of the discussions are centered around either historical or contemporary microtonalisms for furthering Western music culture alone. While I appreciate the contributions by the West to musical art, I believe the Western quarter (pun intended) can account for only a fraction of the actual music-making in the globe. One of the greatest traditions is right next door: A venerable monophonal Middle Eastern culture based on maqamat, destgaha and raga. This &quot;exotic&quot; culture has been influenced by a thousand years of Islamic atmosphere to inspire such styles and practices as Mevlevi rites, Qawwali performances, peshrevs, taqsims, gazels, etc... Your penchant to discover more of the theories and styles of exotic traditions is admirable.</p><p>Though my experience is most inadequate to describe the musical wonders of the Islamic Civilization, my presence in the tuning list as a fresh academician should be construed as an oppurtunity to discover a glimpse of at least the Turkish branch of this grand culture.</p><p>You are correct in establishing 121 and 171 cents as producing &quot;neutral effects&quot;. However, most of the time 168+ cents won&apos;t do at all. I myself shun 170 cents up to 180 cents as a useless region, a sort of &quot;dead zone&quot; if you prefer, and avoid it at all costs. You call the gap between these values the &quot;equitable heptatonic&quot;. It may be useful for some African, Burmese or Gamelan ensembles, but I do not believe much can be done with such intervals in Maqam music.</p><p>You might remember, that in the first year of my presence in the tuning list, I advocated 29-EDO as a temperament suitable for Maqam music for the very reasons explained by Dan and yourself.</p><p>I acknowledge 98:81 or 75:62 as a supraminor second left out in my previous post. Also, 26/21 is also important as a submajor third. Thanks for mentioning these ratios.</p><p>Ah, but supraminor thirds are not restricted to Persian music. For you see, they are important flavours in such maqams as Hijaz, Nikriz and Neveser. I admit, though, that Persians are more fond of supraminor seconds compared to middler seconds.</p><p>14:17:21 makes a wonderful neutral chord.</p><p>I am glad to hear your appreciation of 79 MOS 159-tET.

As far as I can tell, middle second<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals roam the mujannab zone between 14:13 and 11:10. This is a<br/>&gt;&gt; region 37 cents wide. Then again, it is possible to broaden the zone<br/>&gt;&gt; and take 15:14 and 10:9 as the extremes. In that case, we acquire a<br/>&gt;&gt; zone that is 63 cents wide!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Oz (and Dave, and all),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for these remarks so nicely summing up the flexibility of<br/>&gt; intonation in Maqam music, which I have relished as someone seeking<br/>&gt; an appreciation of this high art. Please let me try, with due humility<br/>&gt; as someone in the early stages of learning to hear and most<br/>&gt; imperfectly to approximate this music, both to comment on your<br/>&gt; observations and to address the question of polyphony or harmony and<br/>&gt; the neutral third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly, your suggestion of a basic range from 14:13 to 11:10<br/>&gt; very much agrees with my own perceptions. In a paper to which I am now<br/>&gt; making some small corrections and revisions with many thanks to Dave,<br/>&gt; I suggest a slightly wider range of about 125-170 cents, which I<br/>&gt; recall that Farhat has suggested in his study of Persian Dastgah<br/>&gt; music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At times, I may use 121/122 or 171/172 cents in the place of a neutral<br/>&gt; second, and the effect can approximate that of a neutral second -- for<br/>&gt; example, in certain polyphonic progressions which are, of course,<br/>&gt; outside the scope of traditional Maqam or Dastgah music. However, as I<br/>&gt; have learned, to say that an interval around 170 cents has a generally<br/>&gt; &quot;neutral effect,&quot; and that it aptly and smoothly fits a given Maqam<br/>&gt; for a listener who speaks this musical language as a native, may be<br/>&gt; two quite different things!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I conjecture that high prime limit and relatively simple integer<br/>&gt;&gt; ratios such as 14:13, 27:25, 13:12, 12:11, 35:32, 11:10, 54:49 are<br/>&gt;&gt; at play. Then again, instead of middle seconds, we might be looking<br/>&gt;&gt; at neutral thirds, in which case, the performer could be searching<br/>&gt;&gt; for 17:14, 39:32, 11:9, 27:22, 16:13, 21:17 and 31:25.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me warmly agree that these are evocative ratios. Thinking<br/>&gt; of a neutral third as a major second somewhere around 9:8 plus some<br/>&gt; kind of neutral second is one approach. Another, which Dan Stearns<br/>&gt; interestingly suggested in a recent post, is to take the 8-step<br/>&gt; interval of 29-EDO at 331 cents as a very small neutral third at the<br/>&gt; lower end of the range (maybe 23:19 or, more classically, 63:52). I<br/>&gt; would say likewise that 9/29 octave or 372 cents, a virtually exact<br/>&gt; realization of your 31:25, is at about the upper end of the range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, your ratios yield what I would consider a handy map of the<br/>&gt; region, to which I&apos;ll add one ratio for symmetry, 75:62 at the lower<br/>&gt; boundary (which could also be 98:81, or 4:3 less the classic 54:49<br/>&gt; which Scala calls &quot;Zalzal&apos;s mujannab,&quot; in which case the upper<br/>&gt; boundary could be 243:196, or 9:8 plus 54:49, a tiny superparticular<br/>&gt; difference of 6076:6075):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         small or                                   large<br/>&gt;        supraminor            central            or submajor<br/>&gt;     |---------------|------------------------|---------------|<br/>&gt;   75:62   17:14   39:32   11:9     27:22   16:13   21:17   31:25<br/>&gt;    330     336     342     347      355     360*    366     372<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       *16:13 is actually about 359.47 cents, but I have<br/>&gt;        rounded upward to 360 cents so as to make 39:32<br/>&gt;        and 16:13 add up to a rounded 702 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would seem that often central neutral thirds are typical of Maqam<br/>&gt; music, while the small and large or supraminor/submajor sizes are<br/>&gt; often preferred in Dastgah music. It would interesting to ask whether<br/>&gt; this fits with your own impressions of the music, and how the various<br/>&gt; regional variations of these styles may have evolved, given the rich<br/>&gt; cross-pollination and common elements for these manifestations of the<br/>&gt; Islamic tradition in the Near East.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one seeks historical precedents, then Zalzal&apos;s scale according to<br/>&gt; al-Farabius gives us a subtle 27:22-11:9 division of the fifth. I seem<br/>&gt; to recall that Ibn Sina (or Avicenna in Latin Europe) placed Zalzal&apos;s<br/>&gt; wosta fret at around 39:32; and, of course, 13:12 is a common ratio in<br/>&gt; the medieval Islamic era, which would yield 39:32 when added to 9:8 or<br/>&gt; 16:13 when subtracted from 4:3. His wonderful scale based on a &gt; division<br/>&gt; of a 7:6 third into 14:13:12 also has supraminor thirds at 63:52 or<br/>&gt; 332 cents, and submajor thirds at 26:21 or 369 cents, equal to 9:8<br/>&gt; plus 14:13 or 4:3 less 14:13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I shared with George Secor my taste for 17:14 and 21:17, he<br/>&gt; pointed out to me that 14:17:21 is actually the simplest neutral third<br/>&gt; division of the fifth; either 32:39:48 or 18:22:27 requires a higher<br/>&gt; odd-limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So many ratios imply the necessity to temper pitches and represent<br/>&gt;&gt; diverse middle seconds as well as neutral thirds with few, yet,<br/>&gt;&gt; variagated microtones that are reasonably spaced. That is how I<br/>&gt;&gt; arrived at 79 MOS 159-tET. Check out page 95 of my doctorate<br/>&gt;&gt; dissertation. There, you will see how the 79-tone tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; approximates many RI intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz, this is truly a brilliant system, both the way in which pure 3:2<br/>&gt; fifths and 4:3 fourths are combined with temperament, and the array of<br/>&gt; delicious flavors generated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, in the kinds of polyphonic styles where I use neutral<br/>&gt; thirds toward with smaller minor or larger major thirds, the<br/>&gt; contrapuntal rules for their use are rather alike. Here _all_ thirds<br/>&gt; are relatively blending but unstable, or &quot;quasi-consonant&quot; as you well<br/>&gt; put it -- the neutral ones, but major and minor also! And all types of<br/>&gt; thirds may vary in flavor over a wide range. In fact, I might gives<br/>&gt; ranges of about 254-300 for minor; 330-372 for neutral; and 408-442<br/>&gt; for major. Note that in this kind of style, the areas immediately<br/>&gt; around 6:5 and 5:4 are less typical -- although, as we have noted,<br/>&gt; they are often important in varieties of Maqam music. However, the<br/>&gt; simple ratio or &quot;valley&quot; of 7:6 often figures very prominently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In directed progressions, a general guideline is that a minor or<br/>&gt; supraminor (small neutral) third will often resolve to a unison, and<br/>&gt; submajor (large neutral) or major third to a fifth, one voice moving<br/>&gt; by a major second and the other by a semitone or small neutral<br/>&gt; second. The central neutral range of thirds has a special quality<br/>&gt; because in resolving to either a unison or a fifth, one voice<br/>&gt; typically moves by a major second and the other by a central neutral<br/>&gt; second rather different from either a tone or a semitone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you are curious, here is an article about a 19-note tempered<br/>&gt; system based on two JI tunings by Gene Ward Smith for Aaron<br/>&gt; Johnson. While the main idea is to get lots of minor thirds within<br/>&gt; about 20 cents of 7:6, maybe the most important simple ratio after 3:2<br/>&gt; and 4:3, there are lots of neutral flavors also, although not ones<br/>&gt; necessarily fitting any standard scheme of Maqamat or Dastgah-ha. It<br/>&gt; mibht be interesting, however, as example of flexible tuning for<br/>&gt; thirds (minor, neutral, and major).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-aaron_akj.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I started looking for some traditional Qawwali<br/>&gt; recordings when I heard that song, and I didn&apos;t really find much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any time there is an old, ancient branch of music that has reached<br/>as<br/>&gt; high of a level of artistic development as the one we&apos;re talking<br/>about<br/>&gt; here, people will be interested. I just think many don&apos;t know<br/>about it<br/>&gt; yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One interesting thing to note is that the religious music of all of<br/>&gt; the world sounds very, very, very similar. Perhaps not the music<br/>that<br/>&gt; is &quot;associated&quot; with various churches and such - but the music that<br/>&gt; monks sing, the music that is sung to draw people closer to the<br/>&gt; experience of God.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p><p>One of the best collections of music from the Mideast is a 15-CD set<br/>called _The Music of Islam_, by Celestial Harmonies, 1998.</p><p>-Cris</p></div><h3><a id=77872 href="#77872">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2008 12:54:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>Dear Margo:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for posting your temperament with one wide fifth based on<br/>&gt; complex integer ratios, a technique that fascinates me, and which I<br/>&gt; have used in rather different stylistic settings.<br/>&gt;<br/>My intrest comes form Werckmeister&apos;s:<br/><a href="http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~tdent/septenarius.html">http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~tdent/septenarius.html</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament#Werckmeister_IV_.28VI.29:_the_Septenarius_tunings">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament#Werckmeister_IV_.28VI.29:_the_Septenarius_tunings</a><br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_69724.html#69750">/tuning/topicId_69724.html#69750</a><br/>in his<br/>&quot;Musicalische Temperatur&quot;<br/><a href="http://diapason.xentonic.org/ttl/ttl01.html">http://diapason.xentonic.org/ttl/ttl01.html</a><br/>there on p72.</p><p>! septenarius.scl<br/>!

I am<br/>&gt; glad to observe that the chapters on neutral intervals agree with my<br/>&gt; views on Maqam music theory. Please note, that 14:13 is also given<br/>&gt; by Urmavi as the approximation to all middle melodic (lahni)<br/>&gt; intervals (supraminor seconds) in his treatise (Risale<br/>&gt; al-Sharafiyyah).</p><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Thanks you for this very interesting observation about Urmavi and<br/>14:13. There is a scale in the Scala archives (iran_diat.scl) edited<br/>by Dariush Anooshfar which gives what is identified as a 125-EDO<br/>version of a scale by Urmavi, one which may use some intervals which<br/>are still featured in certain Iranian musics. This is discussed a bit<br/>more below.</p><p>Also, while I am using less than perfect software for processing pdf<br/>files that runs out of virtual memory on your dissertation file, there<br/>is no problem with the doctoral reports and other related documents on<br/>your Web site which I&apos;m guessing may contain similar material. Thank<br/>you for so generously making all of these material available!</p><p>&gt; I think the theory of Maqam music and other &quot;ethnic&quot; genres around<br/>&gt; the world are much neglected by the alternative tuning list<br/>&gt; community.  Most of the discussions are centered around either<br/>&gt; historical or contemporary microtonalisms for furthering Western<br/>&gt; music culture alone. While I appreciate the contributions by the<br/>&gt; West to musical art, I believe the Western quarter (pun intended)<br/>&gt; can account for only a fraction of the actual music-making in the<br/>&gt; globe. One of the greatest traditions is right next door: A<br/>&gt; venerable monophonal Middle Eastern culture based on maqamat,<br/>&gt; destgaha and raga. This &quot;exotic&quot; culture has been influenced by a<br/>&gt; thousand years of Islamic atmosphere to inspire such styles and<br/>&gt; practices as Mevlevi rites, Qawwali performances, peshrevs, taqsims,<br/>&gt; gazels, etc... Your penchant to discover more of the theories and<br/>&gt; styles of exotic traditions is admirable.</p><p>Please let me add, in response to some questions people have raised,<br/>that there are now some excellent books in English by exponents of<br/>some of these traditions: thus Touma and Racy on Maqam music as<br/>practiced in the Arab world; and Farhat on the Persian Dastgah system,<br/>as well as book on this Dastgah tradition with some companion CD&apos;s by<br/>Dr. Tala&grave;i. Racy is especially interesting on the &quot;ecstatic&quot; qualities<br/>of traditional music which is lost when tuning is dictated by<br/>arbitrary standard such as 24-EDO, rather than adapted to each Maqam.</p><p>&gt; You are correct in establishing 121 and 171 cents as producing<br/>&gt; &quot;neutral effects&quot;. However, most of the time 168+ cents won&apos;t do at<br/>&gt; all. I myself shun 170 cents up to 180 cents as a useless region, a<br/>&gt; sort of &quot;dead zone&quot; if you prefer, and avoid it at all costs. You<br/>&gt; call the gap between these values the &quot;equitable heptatonic&quot;. It may<br/>&gt; be useful for some African, Burmese or Gamelan ensembles, but I do<br/>&gt; not believe much can be done with such intervals in Maqam music.</p><p>This may be rather analogous to larger major thirds around 408-440<br/>cents, which may excel in a European style based on medieval or<br/>neomedieval polyphony, but can hardly be aptly substituted as a<br/>general rule in a Renaissance meantone style where 5:4 is expected!</p><p>I seem to recall having read a passage somewhere in your writings<br/>about choosing steps so as to avoid an interval of 170 cents between<br/>two significant degrees for Maqam music.</p><p>&gt; You might remember, that in the first year of my presence in the<br/>&gt; tuning list, I advocated 29-EDO as a temperament suitable for Maqam<br/>&gt; music for the very reasons explained by Dan and yourself.</p><p>I should go back and read your posts: that the three of us all see<br/>29-EDO in this way, coming from quite different perspectives, is<br/>fascinating.</p><p>&gt; I acknowledge 98:81 or 75:62 as a supraminor second left out in my<br/>&gt; previous post. Also, 26/21 is also important as a submajor third.<br/>&gt; Thanks for mentioning these ratios.</p><p>One place 26/21 comes up is in Ibn Sina&apos;s 28:26:24:21 tetrachord.</p><p>&gt; Ah, but supraminor thirds are not restricted to Persian music. For<br/>&gt; you see, they are important flavours in such maqams as Hijaz, Nikriz<br/>&gt; and Neveser. I admit, though, that Persians are more fond of<br/>&gt; supraminor seconds compared to middler seconds.</p><p>&gt; 14:17:21 makes a wonderful neutral chord.</p><p>Agreed!</p><p>&gt; I am glad to hear your appreciation of 79 MOS 159-tET. What do you<br/>&gt; think of my new 24-tone tuning for Maqam music based on a modified<br/>&gt; meantone temperament? I have explained it in the 76333rd message to<br/>&gt; this list.</p><p>This is a fascinating design: 12 notes from a circulating temperament<br/>of Rameau, and the other 12 added to provide some delicious Maqam<br/>flavors!</p><p>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_76333.html#76333">/tuning/topicId_76333.html#76333</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sorry, I am too tired to read the last article on 19-note<br/>&gt; tempered system. Later inshallah.</p><p>Please let me add that after looking at your ingenious Rameau-based<br/>tuning, I thought I might post a less precise set of 24 steps from<br/>Zest-24 which has some of its steps or _perdeler_ (plural of Turkish<br/>_perde_ or &quot;step&quot; or &quot;tone,&quot; if I&apos;m correct) fitting a tuning such as<br/>Anooshfar&apos;s iran_diat.scl which he attributes to Urmavi, rather than<br/>the usual steps appearing your system.</p><p>! iran_diat.scl<br/>!<br/>Iranian Diatonic from Dariush Anooshfar, Safi-a-ddin Armavi&apos;s scale from 125 ET<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 220.800 cents<br/> 441.600 cents<br/> 489.600 cents<br/> 710.400 cents<br/> 931.200 cents<br/> 979.200 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>The Anooshfar-like intervals that arise (I wonder what kind of tuning<br/>by Urmavi was the basis for iran_diat.scl) are the large major third<br/>and sixth at 441 and 932 cents, and also the 50-cent steps (for<br/>example 440-491, 931-982). These seem to me typical of iran_diat.scl<br/>rather than standard Maqam practice, but I wonder how you would see<br/>this.</p><p>An interesting question is how one might name the perdeler in this<br/>Zest-24 tuning.</p><p>    0    224   441  491   708   932  982   1200</p><p>What I would emphasize is that Zest-24 is a radically different way of<br/>going from a 12-note circulating tuning to a 24-note system. You took<br/>Rameau&apos;s 12-note circle and added customized steps designed for ideal<br/>placement in a Maqam style. My method was much more crude: simply add<br/>a second identical circle at a distance suggested by the structure of<br/>the tuning rather than the needs of Maqam intonation.</p><p>As one might say, this is the difference between system where Maqam<br/>music shapes the finely calculated placement of the notes or perdeler;<br/>and one where the notes bend Maqam music to their measure, not<br/>necessarily with any predictability of results!</p><p>When I try &apos;show /line intervals&apos; in Scala, I see some nice versions<br/>of Rast in various forms and Ushshaq, for example -- but not<br/>necessarily in the _relations_ than traditional schemes of modulation<br/>would require.</p><p>Also, the structure of the Zest-24 tuning itself imposes some<br/>arbitrary limitations. For example, your 24-note system includes<br/>neutral thirds at both 17/14 and 16/13; or, in your 79-MOS, sizes of<br/>both 332 and 362 cents above Rast. In Zest-24, however, I realized<br/>that it is impossible to have two sizes of neutral thirds above the<br/>same perde or step. The situation might be analogous to that of some<br/>equal temperaments where only a single size of middle or neutral third<br/>is available -- although here, the size may change as one moves around<br/>the system.</p><p>In a table following the Scala file, I attempt to guess at some<br/>possible names for the steps or perdeler; but I would invite your<br/>comments on this. The question of the perdeler and names for various<br/>shades of modification is one most interesting.</p><p>! zest24-Bbup.scl<br/>!<br/>Tuning set starting from Bb* (24)<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 32.81250<br/> 83.20312<br/> 153.51562<br/> 203.90624<br/> 223.82812<br/> 274.21874<br/> 344.53124<br/> 394.92187<br/> 440.62500<br/> 491.01562<br/> 536.71875<br/> 587.10937<br/> 657.42187<br/> 707.81249<br/> 727.73437<br/> 778.12500<br/> 849.60937<br/> 899.99999<br/> 931.64062<br/> 982.03124<br/> 1040.62500<br/> 1091.01562<br/> 1149.60937<br/> 2/1</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                   approx    tentative               approx   approx<br/>degree    cents    159-EDO   perde name              288-EDO    RI<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  0:     0.00000      0      Rast                       0      1/1<br/>  1:    32.81250      4      (Sarp Rast)                8     64/63<br/>  2:    83.20312     11      Shuri                     20     22/21<br/>  3:   153.51562     20      (Zengule cluster)         37     12/11<br/>  4:   203.90624     27      Dugah                     48      9/8<br/>  5:   223.82812     30      (Sarp Dugah)              54      8/7<br/>  6:   274.21874     37      Nerm (soft) Kurdi         66     75/64<br/>  7:   344.53124     46      Segah of Ushshaq          83     11/9<br/>  8:   394.92187     52      Segah                     95      5/4<br/>  9:   440.62500     58      Dik Nishabur             106      9/7<br/> 10:   491.01562     65      Chargah                  118      4/3<br/> 11:   536.71875     71      Nim Hijaz                129     15/11<br/> 12:   587.10937     78      Hijaz                    141      7/5<br/> 13:   657.42187     87      (Saba cluster)           158     19/13<br/> 14:   707.81249     94      Neva                     170      3/2<br/> 15:   727.73437     96      (Sarp Neva)              175     32/21<br/> 16:   778.12500    103      Bayyati                  187     11/7<br/> 17:   849.60937    113      (Hisar/Huzzam cluster)   204     18/11<br/> 18:   899.99999    119      Huseyni                  216     27/16<br/> 19:   931.64062    123      (Sarp Huseyni)           224     12/7<br/> 20:   982.03124    130      Koutchouk (little) Ajem  236     30/17<br/> 21:  1040.62500    138      (Evdj cluster)           250     51/28<br/> 22:  1091.01562    145      Evdj                     262     15/8<br/> 23:  1149.60937    152      Mahurek                  276     64/33<br/> 24:  1200.00000    159      Gerdaniye                288      2/1</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=77882 href="#77882">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2008 12:56:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@&gt; wrote:</p><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>Werckmeister&apos;s so called<br/>11-limit &quot;septenarian&quot; 99:98 Comma amounts (81:80):(441:440)<br/>11-limit &quot;septenarian&quot; 441:440 Schisma amounts (81:80):(99:98)<br/>if understood that ratios as epimoric bisection of the SC=81:80.</p><p>the following well-tuning uses that as epimoric bi-scetion:</p><p>F 440:441 G = F 881:882 C 880:881 G inbetween F-C-G</p><p>and the trisection<br/>inbetween the violin empty strings G-D-A-E consisting in</p><p>G 98:99 E = G 276:279 E subdivided into 3 epimoric factors:</p><p>G 296:297 D 295:296 A 296:297 E</p><p>and respectively for the schisma B 32768:32805 F within</p><p>E 3968:3969 B F# C# G# 2510:2511 Eb 3764:3765 Bb 4704:4705 F</p><p>into 4 another superparticular ratios<br/>in order to conclude the cycle of 5ths by<br/>the totally amount of an PC=3^12/2^19.</p><p>meanwhile my good-old piano got tuned in that refinement :</p><p>F 881:882 C 880:881 G 296:297 D 295:296 A 296:297 E</p><p>with the interim product inbetween FCGDAE = 80:81 = SC and</p><p>E 3968:3969 B F# C# G# 2510:2511 Eb 3764:3765 Bb 4704:4705 F</p><p>for yielding the Schisma=2^15/5/3^8=32768:32805.</p><p>that&apos;s expanded:<br/>&gt; Start at an minor-tone (10:9) below Scheibler:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G; (7*7=E6:27=49 E8:27=98 &lt;) 99G2 198G3 396G4 := 440Hz*(9:10)<br/>&gt; D; (E6:9=147 E8:9=294 &lt; 295=A5:3 &lt;) 296D4 (&lt;297 = G2*3)<br/>&gt; A; (E6:3=441 E8:3=882 &lt;) 885A5 just as Margo proposes<br/>&gt; E; 1323E6<br/>&gt; B; 31B0...3968B7(&lt;3969=E6*3=49) lowest pitch on 5string doublebass<br/>&gt; F#; 93F#2 := B0*3<br/>&gt; C#; 279C#4 := F#2*3<br/>attend the modifications from here on:<br/>G#; 887G#5 := C#4*3<br/>Eb; 1255Eb6 2510Eb7 (&lt; 2511 := G#5*3)<br/>Bb; (F2:3=29.4 ..

That&apos;s the kind of thing I personally<br/>care about: a temperament that sounds great in the music, and that can<br/>be done entirely by ear in less than 10 minutes without having to<br/>calculate (or even refer to) a page of numbers.

Then again, it is possible to broaden the<br/>zone<br/>&gt; &gt; and take 15:14 and 10:9 as the extremes.

Please let me try, with due<br/>humility<br/>&gt; as someone in the early stages of learning to hear and most<br/>&gt; imperfectly to approximate this music, both to comment on your<br/>&gt; observations and to address the question of polyphony or harmony and<br/>&gt; the neutral third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly, your suggestion of a basic range from 14:13 to 11:10<br/>&gt; very much agrees with my own perceptions. In a paper to which I am<br/>now<br/>&gt; making some small corrections and revisions with many thanks to<br/>Dave,<br/>&gt; I suggest a slightly wider range of about 125-170 cents, which I<br/>&gt; recall that Farhat has suggested in his study of Persian Dastgah<br/>&gt; music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At times, I may use 121/122 or 171/172 cents in the place of a<br/>neutral<br/>&gt; second, and the effect can approximate that of a neutral second --<br/>for<br/>&gt; example, in certain polyphonic progressions which are, of course,<br/>&gt; outside the scope of traditional Maqam or Dastgah music. However,<br/>as I<br/>&gt; have learned, to say that an interval around 170 cents has a<br/>generally<br/>&gt; &quot;neutral effect,&quot; and that it aptly and smoothly fits a given Maqam<br/>&gt; for a listener who speaks this musical language as a native, may be<br/>&gt; two quite different things!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I conjecture that high prime limit and relatively simple integer<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios such as 14:13, 27:25, 13:12, 12:11, 35:32, 11:10, 54:49 are<br/>&gt; &gt; at play. Then again, instead of middle seconds, we might be<br/>looking<br/>&gt; &gt; at neutral thirds, in which case, the performer could be searching<br/>&gt; &gt; for 17:14, 39:32, 11:9, 27:22, 16:13, 21:17 and 31:25.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me warmly agree that these are evocative ratios. Thinking<br/>&gt; of a neutral third as a major second somewhere around 9:8 plus some<br/>&gt; kind of neutral second is one approach. Another, which Dan Stearns<br/>&gt; interestingly suggested in a recent post, is to take the 8-step<br/>&gt; interval of 29-EDO at 331 cents as a very small neutral third at the<br/>&gt; lower end of the range (maybe 23:19 or, more classically, 63:52). I<br/>&gt; would say likewise that 9/29 octave or 372 cents, a virtually exact<br/>&gt; realization of your 31:25, is at about the upper end of the range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, your ratios yield what I would consider a handy map of the<br/>&gt; region, to which I&apos;ll add one ratio for symmetry, 75:62 at the lower<br/>&gt; boundary (which could also be 98:81, or 4:3 less the classic 54:49<br/>&gt; which Scala calls &quot;Zalzal&apos;s mujannab,&quot; in which case the upper<br/>&gt; boundary could be 243:196, or 9:8 plus 54:49, a tiny superparticular<br/>&gt; difference of 6076:6075):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          small or                                   large<br/>&gt;         supraminor            central            or submajor<br/>&gt;      |---------------|------------------------|---------------|<br/>&gt;    75:62   17:14   39:32   11:9     27:22   16:13   21:17   31:25<br/>&gt;     330     336     342     347      355     360*    366     372<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        *16:13 is actually about 359.47 cents, but I have<br/>&gt;         rounded upward to 360 cents so as to make 39:32<br/>&gt;         and 16:13 add up to a rounded 702 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would seem that often central neutral thirds are typical of Maqam<br/>&gt; music, while the small and large or supraminor/submajor sizes are<br/>&gt; often preferred in Dastgah music. It would interesting to ask<br/>whether<br/>&gt; this fits with your own impressions of the music, and how the<br/>various<br/>&gt; regional variations of these styles may have evolved, given the rich<br/>&gt; cross-pollination and common elements for these manifestations of<br/>the<br/>&gt; Islamic tradition in the Near East.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one seeks historical precedents, then Zalzal&apos;s scale according to<br/>&gt; al-Farabius gives us a subtle 27:22-11:9 division of the fifth. I<br/>seem<br/>&gt; to recall that Ibn Sina (or Avicenna in Latin Europe) placed<br/>Zalzal&apos;s<br/>&gt; wosta fret at around 39:32; and, of course, 13:12 is a common ratio<br/>in<br/>&gt; the medieval Islamic era, which would yield 39:32 when added to 9:8<br/>or<br/>&gt; 16:13 when subtracted from 4:3. His wonderful scale based on a<br/>division<br/>&gt; of a 7:6 third into 14:13:12 also has supraminor thirds at 63:52 or<br/>&gt; 332 cents, and submajor thirds at 26:21 or 369 cents, equal to 9:8<br/>&gt; plus 14:13 or 4:3 less 14:13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I shared with George Secor my taste for 17:14 and 21:17, he<br/>&gt; pointed out to me that 14:17:21 is actually the simplest neutral<br/>third<br/>&gt; division of the fifth; either 32:39:48 or 18:22:27 requires a higher<br/>&gt; odd-limit.</p><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>I wish I had more time these to follow some of these discussions on<br/>the tuning lists.

I then set it up on a<br/>harpsichord to give it a fair spin, and I&apos;ve been playing some late<br/>Couperin on it (which, again, is what I asked you to explain, and not<br/>in generalities).</p><p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve got.  These were the most helpful several lines from<br/>your five pages, where you allowed us to round off your 5ths to &quot;only&quot;<br/>four different sizes, instead of micro-managing decimal fragments of<br/>cents:</p><p>&gt; F -1 C -1 G -3 D -3 A -3 E for approximation of about an ~SC<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; E -0.25 B_F#_C#_G# -0.25 Eb -0.25 Bb -0.25 F in PC^(1/12) units</p><p>In other words, we&apos;re supposed to set it up almost the same as in<br/>&quot;Vallotti&quot;, but make the core set of tempered 5ths on the naturals<br/>*uneven* instead of even.  F-C-G get only 1/11 SC apiece, and all the<br/>rest of the syntonic comma goes into G-D-A-E, 3/11 per.  And then the<br/>one schisma that&apos;s left over gets spread carefully across *four* of<br/>the six remaining 5ths.  Golly.</p><p>(And we&apos;re supposed to ignore the fact that for Neidhardt and Sorge,<br/>the 18th century experts, the schisma was the smallest practical unit?<br/>They were right: it *is* hard to control any 5ths that are less than<br/>a schisma off pure, let alone anything as fine as 1/4 schisma...or<br/>decimal bits and pieces grinding it even more finely than that.  But,<br/>let&apos;s continue.)</p><p>Anyway...I did it like this:</p><p>C from fork.</p><p>E in the C-E major 3rd nudged one schisma sharp of pure 5:4.</p><p>C-F 5th one schisma narrow by knocking the F upward the slightest<br/>audible nudge from the pure spot.</p><p>C-G 5th one schisma narrow by knocking the G downward the slightest<br/>audible nudge from pure.</p><p>Set D and A so all three of G-D, D-A, and A-E are averaged out in<br/>quality.  They&apos;re rough.  They&apos;re as bad as almost 1/4 SC each!</p><p>There&apos;s one schisma left to burn off, doing all the notes from<br/>E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-F, where E and F are the fixed endpoints.  From E,<br/>I gave the B the very slightest smudge flatward (1/4 schisma!), which<br/>is just about impossible to control with non-threaded pins, but my<br/>wrist knows I did it.  Then I made B-F#-C#-G# pure as prescribed.<br/>This left D# and A# to be finessed in between G# and F, so each of the<br/>three intervals gets another one of these 1/4 schisma smudges.  It<br/>works out, but again it&apos;s all in the wrist: amounts this tiny are just<br/>about impossible to HEAR with any accuracy.  A quarter of a schisma<br/>off pure?!</p><p>And that&apos;s all 12 notes.</p><p>I played through some music from the last four Ordres by Couperin, and<br/>I&apos;ll do some more.  The results sound reasonable, although I can&apos;t say<br/>they&apos;re any noticeable improvement ahead of normal &quot;Vallotti&quot;.  The<br/>shape is almost identical, other than being done unevenly downtown:<br/>too much tempering in G-D-A-E and not enough in F-C-G.  The several<br/>worst triads (B major, F# major, C# major) are still as bad as they<br/>are in &quot;Vallotti&quot;, give or take less than a schisma.  And E major, A<br/>major, and D major aren&apos;t as good as Vallotti&apos;s; the major 3rds are<br/>higher, and the D-A-E 5ths are rougher.  Oh well!</p><p>It&apos;s a passable sound, but I&apos;d need to be given some compelling<br/>reasons why I (or anyone else) should fuss with this uneven<br/>F-C-G-D-A-E business downtown, instead of simply making all of them<br/>the same quality as one another.  Why don&apos;t we just square off all the<br/>schismatic and sub-schismatic stuff, and give a straightforward<br/>F-C-G-D-A-E of 1/5 PC each, instead of ratios or syntonic comma stuff?<br/>The same major 3rds will be good or bad by virtually &quot;the same&quot;<br/>amounts, when listening to and playing normal 18th century music.<br/>And, after the harpsichord has sat there for an hour or so, it will<br/>have drifted off spots enough already that your 1/4 schisma business<br/>will all be negligible at best.  How is anyone going to know, or care,<br/>that the little 1/4 schisma fragments are in the right spots around<br/>the back, and not between F#-C# or wherever?</p><p>=====</p><p>Meanwhile, your five-page (five!) batch of reckoning still doesn&apos;t<br/>help much with a start from an A fork, which was the question.  (The<br/>note A is in the middle of the heaviest tempering....)  Assume you&apos;re<br/>wanting some other harpsichordist to try this on a real harpsichord,<br/>but they&apos;re less mathematically savvy than I am.

I have been enjoying a well-earned summer&apos;s rest. I hope the importance of the topic has not faded while I was away. My comments are below:</p><p>On Jul 1, 2008, at 1:57 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Dear Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; First, let me thank you for bringing to my attention your well-<br/>&gt;&gt; prepared article titled &quot;Regions of the Interval Spectrum&quot;. I am<br/>&gt;&gt; glad to observe that the chapters on neutral intervals agree with my<br/>&gt;&gt; views on Maqam music theory. Please note, that 14:13 is also given<br/>&gt;&gt; by Urmavi as the approximation to all middle melodic (lahni)<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals (supraminor seconds) in his treatise (Risale<br/>&gt;&gt; al-Sharafiyyah).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Ozan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks you for this very interesting observation about Urmavi and<br/>&gt; 14:13. There is a scale in the Scala archives (iran_diat.scl) edited<br/>&gt; by Dariush Anooshfar which gives what is identified as a 125-EDO<br/>&gt; version of a scale by Urmavi, one which may use some intervals which<br/>&gt; are still featured in certain Iranian musics. This is discussed a bit<br/>&gt; more below.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ah, I am sad to say that the Scala 125-EDO subset does great injustice to the original Ushshaq scale of Urmavi, which I believe goes:</p><p>9:8 x 9:8 x 256:243 x 9:8 x 9:8 x 256:243 x 9:8</p><p>Notice how the limma has been reduced in size by half in the Scala file so as to destroy the qualities of the half-tone step, making it a quarter-tone step. Bear in mind that this Ushshaq has nothing to do with the Ushshaq we perform today. I am at a lost to explain how a diatonic major scale got transformed to a neutral minor during the centuries that followed Urmavi.</p><p>&gt; Also, while I am using less than perfect software for processing pdf<br/>&gt; files that runs out of virtual memory on your dissertation file, there<br/>&gt; is no problem with the doctoral reports and other related documents on<br/>&gt; your Web site which I&apos;m guessing may contain similar material. Thank<br/>&gt; you for so generously making all of these material available!<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are most welcome. I do need to re-organize the clutter in my website however.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think the theory of Maqam music and other &quot;ethnic&quot; genres around<br/>&gt;&gt; the world are much neglected by the alternative tuning list<br/>&gt;&gt; community.  Most of the discussions are centered around either<br/>&gt;&gt; historical or contemporary microtonalisms for furthering Western<br/>&gt;&gt; music culture alone. While I appreciate the contributions by the<br/>&gt;&gt; West to musical art, I believe the Western quarter (pun intended)<br/>&gt;&gt; can account for only a fraction of the actual music-making in the<br/>&gt;&gt; globe. One of the greatest traditions is right next door: A<br/>&gt;&gt; venerable monophonal Middle Eastern culture based on maqamat,<br/>&gt;&gt; destgaha and raga. This &quot;exotic&quot; culture has been influenced by a<br/>&gt;&gt; thousand years of Islamic atmosphere to inspire such styles and<br/>&gt;&gt; practices as Mevlevi rites, Qawwali performances, peshrevs, taqsims,<br/>&gt;&gt; gazels, etc... Your penchant to discover more of the theories and<br/>&gt;&gt; styles of exotic traditions is admirable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me add, in response to some questions people have raised,<br/>&gt; that there are now some excellent books in English by exponents of<br/>&gt; some of these traditions: thus Touma and Racy on Maqam music as<br/>&gt; practiced in the Arab world; and Farhat on the Persian Dastgah system,<br/>&gt; as well as book on this Dastgah tradition with some companion CD&apos;s by<br/>&gt; Dr. Tala&grave;i. Racy is especially interesting on the &quot;ecstatic&quot; qualities<br/>&gt; of traditional music which is lost when tuning is dictated by<br/>&gt; arbitrary standard such as 24-EDO, rather than adapted to each Maqam.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I should state further, that it is most unfortunate that Turks have not written a single academic work on their conception of Maqam music for the auspices of the international music community since Rauf Yekta. My thesis should serve as a brick that closes the centennial gap.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You are correct in establishing 121 and 171 cents as producing<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;neutral effects&quot;. However, most of the time 168+ cents won&apos;t do at<br/>&gt;&gt; all. I myself shun 170 cents up to 180 cents as a useless region, a<br/>&gt;&gt; sort of &quot;dead zone&quot; if you prefer, and avoid it at all costs. You<br/>&gt;&gt; call the gap between these values the &quot;equitable heptatonic&quot;. It may<br/>&gt;&gt; be useful for some African, Burmese or Gamelan ensembles, but I do<br/>&gt;&gt; not believe much can be done with such intervals in Maqam music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This may be rather analogous to larger major thirds around 408-440<br/>&gt; cents, which may excel in a European style based on medieval or<br/>&gt; neomedieval polyphony, but can hardly be aptly substituted as a<br/>&gt; general rule in a Renaissance meantone style where 5:4 is expected!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Nicely put.</p><p>&gt; I seem to recall having read a passage somewhere in your writings<br/>&gt; about choosing steps so as to avoid an interval of 170 cents between<br/>&gt; two significant degrees for Maqam music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Indeed so. I remember having stated the necessity to avoid the equitable heptotonic in Yarman24.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You might remember, that in the first year of my presence in the<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning list, I advocated 29-EDO as a temperament suitable for Maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; music for the very reasons explained by Dan and yourself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should go back and read your posts: that the three of us all see<br/>&gt; 29-EDO in this way, coming from quite different perspectives, is<br/>&gt; fascinating.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Righteously.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I acknowledge 98:81 or 75:62 as a supraminor second left out in my<br/>&gt;&gt; previous post. Also, 26/21 is also important as a submajor third.<br/>&gt;&gt; Thanks for mentioning these ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One place 26/21 comes up is in Ibn Sina&apos;s 28:26:24:21 tetrachord.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I checked Ibn Sina&apos;s passages. The actual tetrachord is given as 8:7 x 14:13 x 13:12. The tetrachord you have mentioned permutes the last two intervals. In the original form, we have 16:13 instead of 26:21. But I suspect the tetrachord should be read the other way around, which yields 12:13:14:16. Ibn Sina calls this a Kavi genus which is of quality and nobility, I am not sure what this corresponds to in music theory of the Ancient world. Ibn Sina says that this is the genus preferred by Ptolemy.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ah, but supraminor thirds are not restricted to Persian music. For<br/>&gt;&gt; you see, they are important flavours in such maqams as Hijaz, Nikriz<br/>&gt;&gt; and Neveser. I admit, though, that Persians are more fond of<br/>&gt;&gt; supraminor seconds compared to middler seconds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 14:17:21 makes a wonderful neutral chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I am glad to hear your appreciation of 79 MOS 159-tET. What do you<br/>&gt;&gt; think of my new 24-tone tuning for Maqam music based on a modified<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone temperament? I have explained it in the 76333rd message to<br/>&gt;&gt; this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a fascinating design: 12 notes from a circulating temperament<br/>&gt; of Rameau, and the other 12 added to provide some delicious Maqam<br/>&gt; flavors!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_76333.html#76333">/tuning/topicId_76333.html#76333</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Don&apos;t forget the 17-tone closed cycle achieved via superpythagorean fifths for 7-limit major and minor chords!</p><p>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m sorry, I am too tired to read the last article on 19-note<br/>&gt;&gt; tempered system. Later inshallah.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me add that after looking at your ingenious Rameau-based<br/>&gt; tuning, I thought I might post a less precise set of 24 steps from<br/>&gt; Zest-24 which has some of its steps or _perdeler_ (plural of Turkish<br/>&gt; _perde_ or &quot;step&quot; or &quot;tone,&quot; if I&apos;m correct) fitting a tuning such as<br/>&gt; Anooshfar&apos;s iran_diat.scl which he attributes to Urmavi, rather than<br/>&gt; the usual steps appearing your system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! iran_diat.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Iranian Diatonic from Dariush Anooshfar, Safi-a-ddin Armavi&apos;s scale &gt; from 125 ET<br/>&gt; 7<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 220.800 cents<br/>&gt; 441.600 cents<br/>&gt; 489.600 cents<br/>&gt; 710.400 cents<br/>&gt; 931.200 cents<br/>&gt; 979.200 cents<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>I urge you not to consider this subset of 125-EDO as a basis for any scale construction. The correct Urmavi scale is the one I provided above.</p><p>&gt; The Anooshfar-like intervals that arise (I wonder what kind of tuning<br/>&gt; by Urmavi was the basis for iran_diat.scl) are the large major third<br/>&gt; and sixth at 441 and 932 cents, and also the 50-cent steps (for<br/>&gt; example 440-491, 931-982). These seem to me typical of iran_diat.scl<br/>&gt; rather than standard Maqam practice, but I wonder how you would see<br/>&gt; this.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I view the 125-EDO subset as a corruption and misrepresentation of Urmavi&apos;s original scale.</p><p>&gt; An interesting question is how one might name the perdeler in this<br/>&gt; Zest-24 tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    0    224   441  491   708   932  982   1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I would emphasize is that Zest-24 is a radically different way of<br/>&gt; going from a 12-note circulating tuning to a 24-note system. You took<br/>&gt; Rameau&apos;s 12-note circle and added customized steps designed for ideal<br/>&gt; placement in a Maqam style. My method was much more crude: simply add<br/>&gt; a second identical circle at a distance suggested by the structure of<br/>&gt; the tuning rather than the needs of Maqam intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As one might say, this is the difference between system where Maqam<br/>&gt; music shapes the finely calculated placement of the notes or perdeler;<br/>&gt; and one where the notes bend Maqam music to their measure, not<br/>&gt; necessarily with any predictability of results!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Agreed!</p><p>&gt; When I try &apos;show /line intervals&apos; in Scala, I see some nice versions<br/>&gt; of Rast in various forms and Ushshaq, for example -- but not<br/>&gt; necessarily in the _relations_ than traditional schemes of modulation<br/>&gt; would require.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, the structure of the Zest-24 tuning itself imposes some<br/>&gt; arbitrary limitations. For example, your 24-note system includes<br/>&gt; neutral thirds at both 17/14 and 16/13; or, in your 79-MOS, sizes of<br/>&gt; both 332 and 362 cents above Rast. In Zest-24, however, I realized<br/>&gt; that it is impossible to have two sizes of neutral thirds above the<br/>&gt; same perde or step. The situation might be analogous to that of some<br/>&gt; equal temperaments where only a single size of middle or neutral third<br/>&gt; is available -- although here, the size may change as one moves around<br/>&gt; the system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>17/14 is not only requisite of Ushshaq as a very low perde segah, but also as the second degree of Hijaz as a fairly steep perde kurdi.</p><p>&gt; In a table following the Scala file, I attempt to guess at some<br/>&gt; possible names for the steps or perdeler; but I would invite your<br/>&gt; comments on this. The question of the perdeler and names for various<br/>&gt; shades of modification is one most interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! zest24-Bbup.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Tuning set starting from Bb* (24)<br/>&gt; 24<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 32.81250<br/>&gt; 83.20312<br/>&gt; 153.51562<br/>&gt; 203.90624<br/>&gt; 223.82812<br/>&gt; 274.21874<br/>&gt; 344.53124<br/>&gt; 394.92187<br/>&gt; 440.62500<br/>&gt; 491.01562<br/>&gt; 536.71875<br/>&gt; 587.10937<br/>&gt; 657.42187<br/>&gt; 707.81249<br/>&gt; 727.73437<br/>&gt; 778.12500<br/>&gt; 849.60937<br/>&gt; 899.99999<br/>&gt; 931.64062<br/>&gt; 982.03124<br/>&gt; 1040.62500<br/>&gt; 1091.01562<br/>&gt; 1149.60937<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;                   approx    tentative               approx   approx<br/>&gt; degree    cents    159-EDO   perde name              288-EDO    RI<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;  0:     0.00000      0      Rast                       0      1/1<br/>&gt;  1:    32.81250      4      (Sarp Rast)                8     64/63<br/>&gt;  2:    83.20312     11      Shuri                     20     22/21<br/>&gt;  3:   153.51562     20      (Zengule cluster)         37     12/11<br/>&gt;  4:   203.90624     27      Dugah                     48      9/8<br/>&gt;  5:   223.82812     30      (Sarp Dugah)              54      8/7<br/>&gt;  6:   274.21874     37      Nerm (soft) Kurdi         66     75/64<br/>&gt;  7:   344.53124     46      Segah of Ushshaq          83     11/9<br/>&gt;  8:   394.92187     52      Segah                     95      5/4<br/>&gt;  9:   440.62500     58      Dik Nishabur             106      9/7<br/>&gt; 10:   491.01562     65      Chargah                  118      4/3<br/>&gt; 11:   536.71875     71      Nim Hijaz                129     15/11<br/>&gt; 12:   587.10937     78      Hijaz                    141      7/5<br/>&gt; 13:   657.42187     87      (Saba cluster)           158     19/13<br/>&gt; 14:   707.81249     94      Neva                     170      3/2<br/>&gt; 15:   727.73437     96      (Sarp Neva)              175     32/21<br/>&gt; 16:   778.12500    103      Bayyati                  187     11/7<br/>&gt; 17:   849.60937    113      (Hisar/Huzzam cluster)   204     18/11<br/>&gt; 18:   899.99999    119      Huseyni                  216     27/16<br/>&gt; 19:   931.64062    123      (Sarp Huseyni)           224     12/7<br/>&gt; 20:   982.03124    130      Koutchouk (little) Ajem  236     30/17<br/>&gt; 21:  1040.62500    138      (Evdj cluster)           250     51/28<br/>&gt; 22:  1091.01562    145      Evdj                     262     15/8<br/>&gt; 23:  1149.60937    152      Mahurek                  276     64/33<br/>&gt; 24:  1200.00000    159      Gerdaniye                288      2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Since there are no more steps between rast and shuri, you should name the second degree as dik rast.

Also, you should name 154 cents as Zengule without the paranthesis. 274 cents makes a very low kurdi, but kurdi nonetheless. Similarly, 345 cents is could be a dik kurdi if you prefer. 441 cents is buselik and nishabur at the same time since there are no other options. I&apos;d rather you called it a buselik. Saba cluster should be plainly saba. You could drop one y from Bayyati to make it more Turkish. 845 cents is plainly hisar without the paranthesis. Little ajem is needless since we took kurdi plainly. Let&apos;s call it simply ajem. Evdj cluster is a misnomer here, it should be a dik ajem.

This &quot;exotic&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; culture has been influenced by a thousand years of Islamic atmosphere<br/>&gt;&gt; to inspire such styles and practices as Mevlevi rites, Qawwali<br/>&gt;&gt; performances, peshrevs, taqsims, gazels, etc...
