This seems to speak well for the<br/>potential doability of the 144-tET notation. As the learning curve is<br/>just a stones throw away from what&apos;s already being tackling with the<br/>72-tET notation -- &quot;often on laughably short rehearsal.&quot;</p><p>To my mind, the Reinhard/AFMM, 1200-tET method is theoretically ideal<br/>(and I imagine it would be for most any composer!), but personally,<br/>I&apos;d still like to have a much better, or more detailed, understanding<br/>of exactly how you go about training players to navigate its<br/>abstractions -- in other words, exactly how do you accomplish, or<br/>teach, some measure of methodical precision with the disembodied +/-<br/>n-cents markings inside the free-floating space of these quartertone<br/>pockets.</p><p>ds</p></div>
