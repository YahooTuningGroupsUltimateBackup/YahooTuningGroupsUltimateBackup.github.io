Also, I seem to recall it saying in roederer that<br/>the region of dissonance is farther away and wider in bass notes. Is that<br/>correct?</p><p>-Bram</p><p>(Much happier now that he&apos;s realized all the math is to be found in the<br/>appendices, was having trouble finding it before.)</p></div>
