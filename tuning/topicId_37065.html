Maneri obtained a primitive,<br/>monophonic 72-equal synthesizer, which he has used to ear-train<br/>students to this day.</p><p>. . . meanwhile, some of Maneri&apos;s younger students from the Boston<br/>Microtonal Collective seem extremely curious about just intonation. i<br/>brought my 31-equal guitar to a party that a few BMC members happened<br/>to be at, and i was mobbed with questions. the first was &quot;how close<br/>does it come to the just intonation major third&quot; and i said &quot;only 1<br/>cent off&quot; . . . this seemed to excite quite a few of the young<br/>musicians there . . .</p></div><h3><a id=37210 href="#37210">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2002 10:53:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know why people have picked on 72-et<br/>&gt; &gt; and ignored its &gt;excellent ability to represent 11-limit harmony?<br/>&gt; &gt;It is a decidedly &gt;curious thing to do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if you really mean &quot;picked on&quot;, you may be referring to harry<br/>partch,<br/>&gt; who in effect &quot;picked on&quot; any equal temperament with fewer than 113<br/>&gt; notes -- yet didn&apos;t include 31 or 41, let alone 72, in his chart<br/>&gt; comparing various equal temperaments to 11-limit JI. ...</p><p>As a matter of fact, Partch *did* include 31-ET in that table in both<br/>editions of _Genesis_ (see p. 430, 2nd Edition).
