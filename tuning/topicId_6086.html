The recordings were later transcribed and<br/>orchestrated by hired assistants under Scelsi&apos;s supervision.  A question that<br/>could perhaps be explored with the assistance of the Scelsi Foundation is<br/>that of the accuracy of these &quot;quartertones&quot;, and the degree of deviation or<br/>tolerance from 24tet to be found in both the original tapes and in<br/>performances of the completed scores under the composer&apos;s supervision.  Since<br/>one idea basic to Scelsi&apos;s later music is that of an inflected unison (listen<br/>to, for example, the _Quattro Pezzi_ for orchestra), and the notated interval<br/>of that inflection is a quartertone, it would be useful to know whether he<br/>really intended a ration of the 24th root of two or just any old pitch which<br/>divides a 12tet semitone.</p><p>BTW, Johnny Reinhard,  I presume that the conductor who leads the Scelsi<br/>Foundation is Aldo Brizzi, and the musicologist in Munich is Hans-Rudolf<br/>Zeller.</p><p>Also, Ferneyhough&apos;s _Unity Capsule_ uses pitches culled from 12tet, 24tet,<br/>and 31tet collections, with precise fingerings given from 24tet and 31tet<br/>pitches required. However, most of F.&apos;s works are notated with quartertones,<br/>and it is extremely difficult to say whether he really  wants 24tet pitches<br/>or just notes inflecting and &quot;in-between&quot; 12tet pitches. Since the<br/>overnotation of his scores necessarily leads to failure by performers to play<br/>what is written with any precision in every other parameter, it seems<br/>reasonable to wonder whether accuracy in pitch production should somehow be<br/>excluded from this lack of accuracy. Would any list members in the San Diego<br/>area be willing to give F. a call and ask?</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/10/1999 4:45:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>When programming for the AFMM, I often have to consider works that use<br/>quartertones in an ornamental capacity (Robert Priest&apos;s music immediately<br/>comes to mind).  Ornamenal microtonality was of more interest to me when<br/>there was less repertoire to choose from.  Things have boomed, relatively.</p><p>Yes, Dan you presume correctly regarding the individuals I was referring to.</p><p>Incidentally, where did F. get his precise flute fingerings?  The Bartolozzi<br/>&quot;New Sounds for Woodwinds&quot; offered poor fingerings for flute.  Toru Takemitsu<br/>was really burned when he used Bartolozzi fingerings for his solo flute<br/>pieces.  Maybe players can only get close based on F.&apos;s fingerings?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
