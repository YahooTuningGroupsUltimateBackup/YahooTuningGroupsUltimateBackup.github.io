Thanks to everyone who has lent me<br/>encouragement and incitement in this over the last years:</p><p>MIDI: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmaval1.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmaval1.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>This piece shows an interesting side of Nicola Vicentino (1511-1576)<br/>as a composer: it&apos;s an Easter setting, _Alleluia: Haec dies_, which he<br/>included in his treatise of 1555 as a chromatic piece singable by a<br/>church choir.</p><p>An adaptive JI version nicely shows the second tuning of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>archicembalo or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; in action, with two meantone<br/>manuals at 1/4-comma (~5.38 cents) apart. Two versions of each note<br/>are available, and we just pick the right mixture to get &quot;perfect<br/>fifths and perfect thirds,&quot; as he puts it.</p><p>Occasionally I&apos;ve gone with tempered meantone intervals, for example<br/>if adaptive JI would require a quartercomma shift in the middle of a<br/>sustained note. My metaphor is that of a fixed-pitch keyboard, the<br/>actual technology of Vicentino&apos;s implementation on his archicembalo<br/>and also his arciorgano or &quot;superorgan&quot; described in 1561.</p><p>One conclusion I might draw from this is that if some kind of<br/>mechanism for a &quot;player harpsichord&quot; or &quot;player organ&quot; had been<br/>available in the 16th century, Vicentino&apos;s system could have very<br/>quickly proven its practicality.</p><p>Of course, Vicentino&apos;s solution is style-specific: it&apos;s designed for<br/>getting pure 16th-century concords, and for other kinds of musics,<br/>European or otherwise, the solutions might be quite different.</p><p>Thus I&apos;d consider Vicentino&apos;s system an impressive success once some<br/>kind of technology is available to &quot;program&quot; the choice of notes, say<br/>a mechanical roll for a player harpsichord or organ, as mentioned<br/>above.</p><p>Additionally, as has been discussed here in various threads from time<br/>to time, Vicentino&apos;s system may model one approach used by actual<br/>performers of Renaissance and Manneristic music to achieve pure<br/>concords with minimal melodic unevenness.</p><p>Zarlino suggests this when he observes that singers seem avoid the<br/>&quot;least intervals&quot; such as the syntonic comma heard on keyboards tuned<br/>to the syntonic diatonic, and that since singers can produce whatever<br/>pitches may be needed, they will act so as to seek concord.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m delighted to have the opportunity to post this example of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s music, in his own adaptive JI system, at such a topical<br/>time.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=27050 href="#27050">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/15/2001 1:14:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Zarlino suggests this when he observes that singers seem avoid the<br/>&gt; &quot;least intervals&quot; such as the syntonic comma heard on keyboards<br/>tuned<br/>&gt; to the syntonic diatonic, and that since singers can produce<br/>whatever<br/>&gt; pitches may be needed, they will act so as to seek concord.</p><p>. . . which two observations, taken together, clearly imply some form<br/>of adaptive JI, as opposed to either strict JI or meantone<br/>temperament.</p><p>(A rare case of Margo being too concise!)</p></div><h3><a id=27057 href="#27057">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/15/2001 2:19:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_27046.html#27046">/tuning/topicId_27046.html#27046</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Paul Erlich and Bob Wendell and everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since there&apos;s been a bit of discussion about Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI<br/>&gt; system, I&apos;d like to offer a MIDI file of one of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>chromatic<br/>&gt; pieces in this system.

I&apos;m sure<br/>&gt; Paul will correct me if I&apos;m not representing him accurately here.</p><p>The structure of the passage, and other factors, overwhelm any<br/>attempt to make a distinction here. For a counterexample, someone<br/>used to and trained in 12-tET may not notice the _harmonic_ effect of<br/>making some major triads just, which involves a shift of about 15<br/>cents in some harmonic intervals, while a melodic shift of about 15<br/>cents may be very disturbing to said listener. If you object that we<br/>are comparing a harmonic _improvement_ to a melodic _worsening_,<br/>well, how about a minor triad in which the minor third is _lowered_<br/>by 15 cents. I think, if there are no associated melodic problems<br/>(say all shifts are cleverly distributed out), this minor triad will<br/>pass accepted without notice, even though it represents a worsening<br/>with respect to both the 10:12:15 and the 16:19:24 ideals for the<br/>minor triad. All this is conditional on the music moving along at a<br/>normal pace -- for slow passages, harmonic mistuning is likely to<br/>become more important.</p><p>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. I would like to stick my vulnerable little neck out and<br/>predict<br/>&gt; that although a quarter comma is not so bad harmonically (otherwise<br/>&gt; we&apos;d have to throw out quarter-comma meantone), it is even less<br/>&gt; disturbing melodically.</p><p>In this instance, I have to agree! A quarter comma seems to live just<br/>safely below the limen of melodic discriminability in most cases (the<br/>exceptions consisting mainly of those who have trained themselves<br/>specifically to hear 5-cent melodic intervals).</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t even think drifting the tonality by a<br/>&gt; quarter comma would disturb most ears, even the pickiest ones, if<br/>&gt; they were to listen without having been advised of it beforehand.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately, we can&apos;t test the last element of that hypothesis<br/>&gt; here,</p><p>Why not? Even Vicentino&apos;s tuning provides for two versions of each<br/>1/4-comma meantone triad, 1/4-comma apart. Though perhaps one<br/>wouldn&apos;t be able to take advantage to this in a progression that<br/>qualifies as &quot;drifting&quot; in the sense you were thinking (?)</p><p>&gt; but we could elsewhere as long as we use highly qualified &gt; ears.</p><p>Aren&apos;t untrained ears the best for such experiments? Though<br/>personally, I obey my own ears when making musical decisions -- how<br/>could I do otherwise?</p></div>
