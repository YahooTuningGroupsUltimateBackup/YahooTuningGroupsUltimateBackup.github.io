Yes I will check<br/>the archives for past conversations on this topic of color and music.</p><p>I tripped into the area of color and music while studying Helmholtz<br/>and other authors of various theory/microtonal books. As extremely<br/>interesting as the topic is, I was taken off the beaten path of<br/>learning about the art of &quot;Alternate Tunings&quot;. I had to put this to<br/>rest for awhile as I need to continue my studies on JI, meantone etc..</p><p>Now I remember, it had allot to do with my studies on resonance. I was<br/>reading a web site on the electromagnetic spectrum and was surprised<br/>to learn that colors actually enter our eyes? or maybe the atmosphere<br/>- whatever-  at cycles per seconds as well! Although (as you<br/>know)these Hertz are much, much, MUCH, MUCH Faster than audio<br/>frequencies. Heck, we&apos;re talking about LIGHT SPEED!</p><p>My initial research resulted in toying with the idea of trying to link<br/>music composition with color so that when the two mediums meet (as in<br/>a live performance with a light show) there would be some sort of<br/>resonance that would better help the audience understand the message<br/>that the musician was trying to get across in his/her<br/>song/composition.</p><p>I hope I explained this somewhat correctly.</p><p>It was an interesting study. I hope to pick it up again soon.</p><p>One thing I feel good about is the fact that the internet is bringing<br/>so many brilliant minds together at once to discuss any conceivable<br/>topic. This -I believe- will &quot;speed up&quot; research and results faster<br/>than ever before in history. I&apos;ve spoke with a few people in the<br/>tuning group on this topic of color and music and was amazed at the<br/>responses. I was well educated at the same time. All it takes is for<br/>one person to get the ball rolling (or re-rolling) and bingo! your<br/>saturated with awesome knowledge!</p><p>I remember I heard on the radio awhile back that a scientist(in the<br/>old days)had figured a way to send a man to the moon and bring him<br/>back. I forget the details about &quot;the flight plans&quot; but his studies<br/>were apparently a first step in some direction which eventually led to<br/>Apollo 11. At the same time, a newspaper said the idea was &quot;in a nut<br/>shell&quot; ridiculous.</p><p>Conclusion: It all starts with an idea! Never give up!</p><p>Regards<br/>Walter</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Walter (Wally) &quot; &lt;earth7@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16990">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16990</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Paul<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the feedback on color frequencies and audible<br/>&gt; frequencies.<br/>&gt; &gt; You make some interesting points. Please read my conversations<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; Dr. Jim Lochner. Can there be any relation at all between Color<br/>&gt; &gt; frequencies and audible frequencies when they are the &quot;same<br/>&gt; frequency<br/>&gt; &gt; yet many octaves apart??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You know, this must be an interesting subject because it seems to<br/>&gt; keep surfacing every few months or so.  So Scriabin isn&apos;t the only<br/>&gt; person interested in it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, Wally, I suggest you search the archives... lets say about<br/>8<br/>&gt; months ago or so.  We went over all of this then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Basically, it was pretty much concluded, after the advice of several<br/>&gt; &quot;knowledgables&quot; that sound and light are so different, that there<br/>&gt; really was no physiological parallel.  It would be more in the realm<br/>&gt; of psychology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might also be interested in the experiment that Joe Monzo did<br/>&gt; maybe four of five months ago where he plotted the distances of the<br/>&gt; solar system, and turned the entire thing into one grand,<br/>magnificent<br/>&gt; chord!  In fact, you can still hear this chord in the Monzo<br/>&gt; &quot;files&quot; folder of this e-group...<br/>&gt; _________ ____ __ _<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
