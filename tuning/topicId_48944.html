I can&apos;t help that I think this way.  Maybe I<br/>will change.  Automatic retuning is of academic interest to me.

Actually for such a limited purpose<br/>heuristic retuning might be highly reliable.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But let&apos;s assume anyway that I am interested in that &quot;1&quot; octatonic<br/>&gt; as a<br/>&gt;&gt; primary goal, but I am curious about the other 2, and I definitely<br/>&gt; want to<br/>&gt;&gt; tie down that remaining degree of freedom because in fact I *will*<br/>&gt; be using<br/>&gt;&gt; a 12-tone instrument and the other notes will not be muted, so I<br/>&gt; want to<br/>&gt;&gt; give them a pitch!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you go 94-94-112, repeated every 300 cents, you will have<br/>&gt; 2 &quot;optimal&quot; octatonic scales and one &quot;funky&quot; one. How&apos;s that?</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s fine for 1200 octave.  So on to the other questions.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ok, so with 3 of them then you have 94+94+112,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; read my mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was first asking the question what can happen if you add 1<br/>&gt; degree<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of freedom:  the width of the octave which is divided into 12<br/>&gt; equal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, what criterion do you want to use?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Let&apos;s start with the &quot;defacto&quot; idea above and see if you can come<br/>&gt; up with an<br/>&gt;&gt; objective interpretation of that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dunno.

You&apos;re making a list of intervals, not a set, so that<br/>some intervals recur, and if the recur you weight them by # of occurrences?</p><p>&gt; , and minimize<br/>&gt; the sum-squared errors. I get that four times the period is 1198.974<br/>&gt; cents, and the generator is 97.852 cents.</p><p>Interesting!  So this reduces the discrepancy between the 3 octatonics in a<br/>12-tone super-scale.  I suppose that might have been expected intuitively.<br/>But I didn&apos;t guess the generator would increase from 94 to 98.  That&apos;s most<br/>of the way home toward an edo.</p><p>&gt; Gene would probably avoid unreduced fractions and get that four times<br/>&gt; the period is 1198.859 cents, and the generator is 96.515 cents.

In doing so it says that small errors are less important than large<br/>errors, less important even than their &quot;size&quot; would indicate.  Thus in<br/>effect, tiny errors disappear, and large errors are magnified.  I think this<br/>is good above a certain size error.  But it may be that when thinking in<br/>terms of consonance (the reverse criterion of error) that consonances of a<br/>certain goodness (below a certain error) are &quot;extra good&quot; and count for more<br/>consonance.  This is the *opposite* of what squaring the error achieves.

What is the case you&apos;re thinking of, where some<br/>good consonances make up for other bad ones?</p><p>&gt;Octatonic is already better than a well-tempered (at what it does)<br/>&gt;with 2:1 octaves.  Flatting octatonic octaves should be &quot;no<br/>&gt;worse&quot; than flattening well-tempered octaves, crudely speaking.</p><p>Keep in mind that around here, &quot;well tempered&quot; just means a<br/>circulating temperament.

Flatting octatonic octaves should be &quot;no<br/>&gt;&gt; worse&quot; than flattening well-tempered octaves, crudely speaking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep in mind that around here, &quot;well tempered&quot; just means a<br/>&gt; circulating temperament.

However, I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; think they&apos;re just not playing in the bad keys.  Take Werckmeister 3<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and play something in F# and get back to me.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve done all this.  I find the &quot;strain&quot; happenns in the same places<br/>&gt;&gt; in all well-temperaments, including Alaska 1.

But<br/>&gt; the 8 bad thirds of Alaska 1 are much better than in those<br/>&gt; temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How are you getting 33%?

Anyway<br/>&gt;it seems clear that all of the people who want to sharpen octaves to<br/>&gt;brighten things up are indeed headed in the wrong direction if we are<br/>&gt;talking about common practice music.<br/>//<br/>&gt;For 7-limit, at least, it appears 12-et wants to have flattened<br/>&gt;octaves. Aside from the zeta function octave I mentioned, we might<br/>&gt;note that diminished, augmented, pajara, injera, tripletone, meantone,<br/>&gt;schismic, diaschismic and duodecimal all are 7-limit temperaments<br/>&gt;covered by [12,19,28,34]. The following tabulates the octave for the<br/>&gt;canonical map of all of these temperaments:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;dominant seventh 1190.496<br/>&gt;diminished 1200<br/>&gt;augmented 1200<br/>&gt;pajara 1198.222<br/>&gt;injera 1200<br/>&gt;tripletone 1195.496<br/>&gt;meantone 1200<br/>&gt;schismic 1199.848<br/>&gt;diaschismic 1198.998<br/>&gt;duodecimal 1200<br/>//<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; I assumed Gene was finding the optimal generators for<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; linear temperaments compatible with common-practice<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; music.  That is, &apos;including the 2s&apos;, as we discussed<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; a while back.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I wasn&apos;t, actually. However, I think I will now do this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For the dominant seventh temperament, the results are<br/>&gt;disconcertingly varied:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;even 7-limit minimax [1190.496, 493.917]<br/>&gt;(This is the canonical map.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;even 7-limit rms [1192.064, 494.731]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;even 8-limit rms [1194.349, 496.068]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;even 8-limit minimax [1200, 497.085]</p><p>I then built some tools in scheme to check out circulating versions<br/>of flattened-octave temperaments, and both Gene and I used Scala to<br/>create audio examples.</p><p>With two sizes of fifth and 12 tones, the Alaska series of tunings<br/>pretty much covers all the points you&apos;d be interested in.
