It is also highly symbolic that this<br/>mirroring occurs through a comma of 144/143, that unites 11 and 13.</p><p>I laughed a lot when I read you writing about the &quot;Maqam Mohajira&quot; -<br/>this would need first to be demonstrated through compositions by real<br/>traditional musicians (if they ever get into it someday), and we are<br/>far from that !

Are&apos;nt Indian musicians creating new<br/>ragas all the time, even if ragas are known &quot;to come from the Gods&quot;,<br/>and no one will dare to say the contrary ? (for my part as I always<br/>say, between the Heavens and the Earth, scales are welcome ! :)<br/>To your very complete analysis the only thing I may add from my<br/>humble experimentations is an ensemble of migratory but coherent<br/>versions of &quot;Mohajira&quot; tetrachords, that one may find in the series<br/>described by the two main recurrent sequences issued from 9 and 13 :</p><p>36 : 39 : 44 : 48 (&quot;Old Esfahan&quot; ?)<br/>44 : 48 : 54 : 59<br/>48 : 52 : 59 : 64 (Dudon_b.scl)<br/>54 : 59 : 66 : 72 (Dudon_a.scl)<br/>59 : 64 : 72 : 78<br/>66 : 72 : 81 : 88 (Medieval Iraq)<br/>81 : 88 : 99 : 108 (al-Farabi/Rast)<br/>88 : 96 : 108 : 117<br/>96 : 104 : 117 : 128 (Ibn Sina/Mustaqim)<br/>99 : 108 : 121 : 132 (meantone temperament)<br/>117 : 128 : 143 : 156 (meantone temperament)<br/>117 : 128 : 144 : 156 (Mustaqim reversed)</p><p>You have already mentionned some of them from the traditional<br/>sources, and among the possible traditional issues you found, I got<br/>especially interested like you in the &quot;Old Esfahan&quot; tetrachord and<br/>its larger central tone of 209 cents. This is precisely the size of<br/>44/39 and by co&iuml;ncidence, it appears to be part of the first<br/>tetrachord of my list, that gives a a realistic harmonic version of<br/>this tetrachord.<br/>If we extend it in the higher tetrachord by a Bayati, this gives<br/>again a magnificent Mohajira heptatonic scale I used to call &quot;Ibina&quot;<br/>who is perhaps among all of them, the one I used the most :<br/>72 : 78 : 88 : 96 : 108 : 117 : 128 : 144<br/>(1/1  13/12  11/9  4/3  3/2  13/8  16/9  2/1)<br/>(the reference tone, for the classic mode J T J T J T J, shifted to<br/>117...)<br/>And its mode from 96 = Mustaqim...</p><p>This tetrachord  list also shows the use of prime limit 59 that<br/>completes the two other major ingredients (besides 3), 11 and 13.<br/>In the Mohajira series &quot;issued from 13&quot; : 18 22 26 32 39 48 59 72<br/>88,  59 appears to have a transition role between 11 and 13 in regard<br/>of differential coherence, expressed by the neutral thirds difference<br/>tones and equal-beating properties :<br/>59 - 48 = 11<br/>72 - 59 = 13<br/>(or in the equal-beating form) :<br/>11*22 - 4*59 = 9*22 - 4*48 = 3*(4*72 - 11*26) = 3*(4*59 - 9*26) = 6</p><p>While 24-EDO, 31-EDO then 55-EDO would be the three main cycling<br/>attractors of the fractal generator, your mention of 44-EDO is also<br/>interesting for 13 steps would amount to a quasi 27/22 ; however I<br/>don&apos;t consider it to be typically representative of a Mohajira<br/>sequence, as there are different models for generators past the half<br/>of a pure fifth and around 27/22 one of them is &quot;Zalarith&quot; whose<br/>sequence is 8x^2 - 9x = 1 and based on the -c of 12/11, but that&apos;s<br/>another story, and already a few teapots away !...)</p><p>Anyway no one could write a better description of Mohajira and I have<br/>nothing to add !<br/>Thank you also very much for the musical tracks you gave, that wouldbe certainly inspiring to hear !</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2010 6:16:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Dear Margo,</p><p>&gt; Once more, thank you so much for this incredibly well-documented and<br/>&gt; passionating answer.</p><p>Dear Jacques,</p><p>Thank you for your patience in reading through my rather lengthy<br/>discussion, and your creativity in this reply!</p><p>&gt;  I believe you should write a book (it would probably take several<br/>&gt;  volumes) on the subject of Middle-East scales, in which your<br/>&gt;  knowledge seems to have no end.

I will address thisshortly, but would like to focus on<br/>the beauties of your catalogue:</p><p>&gt;  36 : 39 : 44 : 48 (&quot;Old Esfahan&quot; ?)<br/>&gt;  44 : 48 : 54 : 59<br/>&gt;  48 : 52 : 59 : 64 (Dudon_b.scl)<br/>&gt;  54 : 59 : 66 : 72 (Dudon_a.scl)<br/>&gt;  59 : 64 : 72 : 78<br/>&gt;  66 : 72 : 81 : 88 (Medieval Iraq)<br/>&gt;  81 : 88 : 99 : 108 (al-Farabi/Rast)<br/>&gt;  88 : 96 : 108 : 117<br/>&gt;  96 : 104 : 117 : 128 (Ibn Sina/Mustaqim)<br/>&gt;  99 : 108 : 121 : 132 (meantone temperament)<br/>&gt;  117 : 128 : 143 : 156 (meantone temperament)<br/>&gt;  117 : 128 : 144 : 156 (Mustaqim reversed)</p><p>A few quick points about some of the felicities here. First, I am<br/>delighted how you draw on Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s 64:59:54:48 ratios<br/>in a modern -c context; I have thought of his tetrachord as a nice<br/>shading for Maqam Bayyati at 141-153-204 cents rather close to<br/>52:48:44:39 at 139-150-209 cents (here the string ratios come to me<br/>more easily). Scott Marcus says that in Egyptian practice the minor<br/>third may be close to 32/27, with the lower step at around 135-145<br/>cents, so it seems that Safi al-Din&apos;s tetrachord may fit well.</p><p>Also, as a lover of the 352/351 relationship, I am pleased to see how<br/>we sometimes have a 44/39 tone, and sometimes a &quot;justly tempered&quot;<br/>fourth at 117/88. I guess my favorite regular temperaments at around<br/>704-705 cents strike a certain compromise between these situations.</p><p>Finally, I never before considered 144/143 in terms of meantone, but<br/>indeed 143:128 is close to Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma temperament!</p><p>And I love this kind of systematic exploration of possibilities and<br/>permutations,</p><p>&gt;  You have already mentionned some of them from the traditional<br/>&gt;  sources, and among the possible traditional issues you found, I got<br/>&gt;  especially interested like you in the &quot;Old Esfahan&quot; tetrachord and<br/>&gt;  its larger central tone of 209 cents.  This is precisely the size<br/>&gt;  of 44/39 and by co?ncidence, it appears to be part of the first<br/>&gt;  tetrachord of my list, that gives a a realistic harmonic version of<br/>&gt;  this tetrachord.</p><p>As I should have emphasized, 132-209-154 cents is merely my tempered<br/>tuning in one regular 24-note system I favor, with another offering a<br/>closer approximation at 138-208-150 cents of what I agree is an ideal<br/>just tuning for this interpretaton at 36:39:44:48. However, the modern<br/>Persian discussions about the &quot;Old Esfahan&quot; (the only ones I know) are<br/>much more general, the main idea being &quot;small neutral second, tone,<br/>large neutral second.&quot; From Farhat&apos;s fretting diagram one might think<br/>in terms of something like 135-205-160 cents to fit this description<br/>(e.g. G-Ap-Bp-C), although his chosen location at D-Ep-F&gt;-G would<br/>actually yield in his tuning a Buzurg at 135-225-135 cents.</p><p>Interestingly a central tone around 44/39 does seem to occur in a<br/>measured performance by setar master Ahmad Ebadi as reported by Jean<br/>During, with steps of about 140.7-209.7-140.7 cents. Whatever kind of<br/>an Esfahan this is, I would, assuming these measurements are accurate,<br/>call it one shading of the Mohajira we seek in traditional practice.</p><p>&gt;  If we extend it in the higher tetrachord by a Bayati, this gives<br/>&gt;  again a magnificent Mohajira heptatonic scale I used to call<br/>&gt;  &quot;Ibina&quot; who is perhaps among all of them, the one I used the most :</p><p>&gt;  72 : 78 : 88 : 96 : 108 : 117 : 128 : 144<br/>&gt;  (1/1  13/12  11/9  4/3  3/2  13/8  16/9  2/1)<br/>&gt;  (the reference tone, for the classic mode J T J T J T J,<br/>    shifted to 117...)</p><p>&gt;  And its mode from 96 = Mustaqim...</p><p>That is indeed a magnificent scale and a wonderful connection to Ibn<br/>Sina! Here is a tempered version in Peppermint, a 24-note tuning based<br/>on Keenan Pepper&apos;s regular temperament at 704.096 cents (using two<br/>12-note chains at 58.68 cents apart for some just 7/6 thirds), which<br/>shades the 16/9 to something very close to a 39/22:</p><p>! pep_dudon_ibina_E.scl<br/>!<br/>Peppermint tempering of Dudon&apos;s Ibina: 72:78:88:96:108:117:128:144<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 138.20166<br/> 346.39287<br/> 495.90439<br/> 704.09561<br/> 842.29727<br/> 991.80879<br/> 2/1</p><p>&gt;  This tetrachord list also shows the use of prime limit 59 that<br/>&gt;  completes the two other major ingredients (besides 3), 11 and 13.</p><p>Might 23 sometimes arise? I reflect here on 23:16 (628 cents, close to<br/>the 56:39 in Buzurg) or 23:14 (a larger neutral sixth at 859 cents,<br/>a tad wider than 64:39), for example.</p><p>&gt;  In the Mohajira series &quot;issued from 13&quot; : 18 22 26 32 39 48 59 72 88,<br/>&gt;  59 appears to have a transition role between 11 and 13 in<br/>&gt;  regard of differential coherence, expressed by the neutral thirds<br/>&gt;  difference tones and equal-beating properties :</p><p>&gt;  59 - 48 = 11<br/>&gt;  72 - 59 = 13<br/>&gt;  (or in the equal-beating form) :<br/>&gt;  11*22 - 4*59 = 9*22 - 4*48 = 3*(4*72 - 11*26) = 3*(4*59 - 9*26) = 6</p><p>Could this be another instance where &quot;spectrum coherence,&quot; the<br/>proximity of 64:59 to 13:12 and 59:54 to 12:11, somehow relates to<br/>these -c connections?</p><p>Also, I notice that the differences in the series sum up lots of the<br/>relevant prime factors or their multiples:</p><p>        18  22  26  32  39  48  59  72  88<br/>          4   4   6   7   9   11  13  16</p><p>Indeed 4:6:7:9:11:13 is a hexad summing up the main harmonic factors<br/>in lots of tuning systems I use! A small point is that each pair of<br/>adjacent terms define the ratio of a neutral third -- except for 22:26<br/>or 13:11, one of my favorite sizes for a regular minor third.</p><p>&gt;  While 24-EDO, 31-EDO then 55-EDO would be the three main cycling<br/>&gt;  attractors of the fractal generator, your mention of 44-EDO is also<br/>&gt;  interesting for 13 steps would amount to a quasi 27/22 ; however I<br/>&gt;  don&apos;t consider it to be typically representative of a Mohajira<br/>&gt;  sequence, as there are different models for generators past the<br/>&gt;  half of a pure fifth and around 27/22 one of them is &quot;Zalarith&quot;<br/>&gt;  whose sequence is 8x^2 - 9x = 1 and based on the -c of 12/11, but<br/>&gt;  that&apos;s another story, and already a few teapots away !...)</p><p>Curiously, most of my experience has been with temperaments around<br/>704-705 cents where a Mohajira mode or chain of generators involves<br/>two unequal neutral thirds, for example 341-363 cents at 704.607<br/>cents. Your Soria 17+2 versions, while far more intricate, do seem to<br/>have a kindred spirit, as well as things like hemifourths that i miss<br/>in such regular schemes. George Secor&apos;s 17-note well-temperament<br/>(secor.scl in my dated version of the Scala archives) has a spectrum<br/>of shadings really inviting Mohajira as a tetrachord, mode, or method<br/>of subset generation.</p><p>&gt;  Anyway no one could write a better description of Mohajira and I<br/>&gt;  have nothing to add !</p><p>Please let me say what a pleasure it is to be a part of your saga of<br/>discovering, rediscovering, or helping us better to recognize the<br/>beauty of Mohajira!</p><p>&gt; Thank you also very much for the musical tracks you gave, that would<br/>&gt; be certainly inspiring to hear !</p><p>And you are immensely adding to my knowledge and appreciation of maqam<br/>music both known and yet evolving. Mohajira is a most fertile theme,<br/>as you have known for almost two decades and I am happily learning.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2010 7:14:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, as a lover of the 352/351 relationship, I am pleased to see how<br/>&gt; we sometimes have a 44/39 tone, and sometimes a &quot;justly tempered&quot;<br/>&gt; fourth at 117/88.

My original idea was a 10-note gamelan set<br/>where the notes for slendro would alternate with those for<br/>a 5-note pelog, but I soon found myself making it 10+1 to<br/>include a complete tempered version of Wilson&apos;s <a href="http://1.3.7.9">1.3.7.9</a><br/>hexany.</p><p>What I quickly realized was that the 10+1 version also<br/>completed a couple of useful maqam/dastgah sets, and that<br/>there were lots of Mohajira tetrachords to explore in<br/>various modes, as well as some complete Mohajira modes.</p><p>After reading your recent post about the &quot;Ibina&quot; tuning of</p><p> 72    78    88   96   108   117  128   144<br/>1/1  13/12  11/9  4/3  3/2  13/8  16/9  2/1</p><p>I searched for an approximation in my 11-note set, but<br/>could not find the right notes in the right places.<br/>However, I did find this, which I might not have noticed<br/>if I were using the full 24-note temperament from which<br/>my subset comes, where I would likely have found what I<br/>sought and looked no further:</p><p> 0   132  341  474  705  837  969  1200<br/>  132  209  132   231 132  132  231</p><p>This turns out to be trivalent scale, with the tempering out<br/>of the 169/168 (so usefully observed in your s-n-buzurg.scl<br/>in the Ethno2 collection), so various just interpretations<br/>are possible.

I&apos;m a big fan of 46et myself, but I<br/>&gt; thought you preferred 17 or 34.</p><p>Dear Gene,</p><p>Thank you for asking this question at a time when I&apos;m looking back on<br/>the summer of 2000, ten years ago, when I first got involved with<br/>temperaments in what I came to call the &quot;704-cent neighborhood.&quot;<br/>Here are my first impressions, with a notable absence of any<br/>discussion of Near Eastern music, which I was only to start exploring<br/>in 2001-2002 thanks to the inspired mentorship of George Secor and the<br/>very experienced and encouraging hand of Can Akkoc as I took my first<br/>steps into the world of the maqam.</p><p>  &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NeoGothic-Parts_1_and_2.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NeoGothic-Parts_1_and_2.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Please let me clarify that while I look on my favorite 24-note open<br/>systems as having a kinship to 17-EDO or related unequal tunings such<br/>as George Secor&apos;s 17-WT and now Jacques Dudon&apos;s Soria 17+2 versions,<br/>and while these 24-note systems use shades of temperament quite close<br/>to 46-EDO, the 24-note approach has its own logic.</p><p>In the e-based temperament at 704.607 cents, we have a single chain of<br/>24 notes, with fifths about 2.65 cents wide. In Peppermint, based on<br/>Kennan Pepper&apos;s proposed &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; temperament, we have fifths at<br/>704.096 cents, with two 12-note chains at 58.680 cents apart so as to<br/>provide via this &quot;artificial diesis&quot; some pure 7:6 minor thirds. This<br/>involves stretching G#-D#, the middle fifth of the 23-fifth chain, by<br/>about 11 cents -- a nice size for gamelan, along with the<br/>approximations of 21:16 and 32:21 available in both systems. However,<br/>as Jacques has reminded me, gamelan really also wants some hemifourths<br/>closer to 250 cents, one good reason for using other systems too!</p><p>While the e-based temperament grew out of a mathematical speculation<br/>in the early summer of 2000, we might describe it practically as<br/>in the region where 15 fifths up yield a near-pure 7:4; 11 fifths<br/>up yield a near-pure 11:8; and, interestingly, 6 fifths up yield a<br/>near-pure 23:16. In Peppermint, 7/6 is pure, and a division like<br/>33:36:39:42:44 has an overall accuracy as great as I&apos;ve seen in any<br/>tempered system. While the e-based system has only two sizes of<br/>Zalzalian or neutral intervals (e.g. 132 and 154 cents), and uses a<br/>twice a &quot;mean-apotome&quot; of 132.25 cents to approximate 7:6, Peppermint<br/>has sizes of 129, 138, 150, and 159 cents, thus observing the 169/168<br/>comma between 14:13 and 13:12 with near-just accuracy.</p><p>By the way, in the late summer of 2000, I devised a 17-note<br/>circulating temperament with 12 fifths at 704.377 cents, yielding some<br/>just 14:11 major thirds. The next summer, I learned about George<br/>Secor&apos;s 17-WT where he used 8 fifths of the same size back in 1978 --<br/>a shading almost identical to 46-EDO.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2010 11:55:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; While the e-based temperament grew out of a mathematical speculation<br/>&gt; in the early summer of 2000, we might describe it practically as<br/>&gt; in the region where 15 fifths up yield a near-pure 7:4; 11 fifths<br/>&gt; up yield a near-pure 11:8; and, interestingly, 6 fifths up yield a<br/>&gt; near-pure 23:16.</p><p>That sounds a great deal like 109-equal, and suggests adding that taking 25 fifths yields a nearly pure 8/5.</p><p>&gt; By the way, in the late summer of 2000, I devised a 17-note<br/>&gt; circulating temperament with 12 fifths at 704.377 cents, yielding some<br/>&gt; just 14:11 major thirds.</p><p>You can do that sort of thing in 12 notes also, though George thinks that&apos;s going a bit too far.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2010 12:15:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; While the e-based temperament grew out of a mathematical speculation<br/>&gt; &gt; in the early summer of 2000, we might describe it practically as<br/>&gt; &gt; in the region where 15 fifths up yield a near-pure 7:4; 11 fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; up yield a near-pure 11:8; and, interestingly, 6 fifths up yield a<br/>&gt; &gt; near-pure 23:16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That sounds a great deal like 109-equal, and suggests adding that taking 25 fifths yields a nearly pure 8/5.</p><p>You can then subdivide the fifth into four minor whole tones (10/9) and take nine of those to get to 5/2.

I will address this shortly, but would like to &gt; focus on<br/>&gt; the beauties of your catalogue:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 36 : 39 : 44 : 48 (&quot;Old Esfahan&quot; ?)<br/>&gt; &gt; 44 : 48 : 54 : 59<br/>&gt; &gt; 48 : 52 : 59 : 64 (Dudon_b.scl)<br/>&gt; &gt; 54 : 59 : 66 : 72 (Dudon_a.scl)<br/>&gt; &gt; 59 : 64 : 72 : 78<br/>&gt; &gt; 66 : 72 : 81 : 88 (Medieval Iraq)<br/>&gt; &gt; 81 : 88 : 99 : 108 (al-Farabi/Rast)<br/>&gt; &gt; 88 : 96 : 108 : 117<br/>&gt; &gt; 96 : 104 : 117 : 128 (Ibn Sina/Mustaqim)<br/>&gt; &gt; 99 : 108 : 121 : 132 (meantone temperament)<br/>&gt; &gt; 117 : 128 : 143 : 156 (meantone temperament)<br/>&gt; &gt; 117 : 128 : 144 : 156 (Mustaqim reversed)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few quick points about some of the felicities here. First, I am<br/>&gt; delighted how you draw on Safi al-Din al-Urmawi&apos;s 64:59:54:48 ratios<br/>&gt; in a modern -c context;</p><p>Yes, I had heard of the use of that 59/48 too (thanks to you I can give a name to that tetrachord now, that I use in some of my -c Rast lower tetrachord versions, since 59 - 48 = 11) - one very good example among others of the use of differentially-coherent intervals in oriental music !</p><p>&gt; I have thought of his tetrachord as a nice<br/>&gt; shading for Maqam Bayyati at 141-153-204 cents rather close to<br/>&gt; 52:48:44:39 at 139-150-209 cents (here the string ratios come to me<br/>&gt; more easily). Scott Marcus says that in Egyptian practice the minor<br/>&gt; third may be close to 32/27, with the lower step at around 135-145<br/>&gt; cents, so it seems that Safi al-Din&apos;s tetrachord may fit well.</p><p>Haha, I like that, nice Bayati indeed, in strings ratios ! I would go up to 19/16 myself, but I like 13/11, and 32/27 has good arguments.</p><p>&gt; Also, as a lover of the 352/351 relationship,</p><p>So am I ... and if we take the divisors of both 352 and 351<br/>and bring them to the same octave (I experimented that with all possible commas years ago !) we get :<br/>96 : 104 : 117 : 128 : 144 : 156 : 176 : 192  = Mohajira ...</p><p>&gt; I am pleased to see how<br/>&gt; we sometimes have a 44/39 tone, and sometimes a &quot;justly tempered&quot;<br/>&gt; fourth at 117/88.

This is precisely the size<br/>&gt; &gt; of 44/39 and by coincidence, it appears to be part of the first<br/>&gt; &gt; tetrachord of my list, that gives a a realistic harmonic version of<br/>&gt; &gt; this tetrachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As I should have emphasized, 132-209-154 cents is merely my tempered<br/>&gt; tuning in one regular 24-note system I favor, with another offering a<br/>&gt; closer approximation at 138-208-150 cents of what I agree is an ideal<br/>&gt; just tuning for this interpretaton at 36:39:44:48. However, the modern<br/>&gt; Persian discussions about the &quot;Old Esfahan&quot; (the only ones I know) are<br/>&gt; much more general, the main idea being &quot;small neutral second, tone,<br/>&gt; large neutral second.&quot; From Farhat&apos;s fretting diagram one might think<br/>&gt; in terms of something like 135-205-160 cents to fit this description<br/>&gt; (e.g. G-Ap-Bp-C), although his chosen location at D-Ep-F&gt;-G would<br/>&gt; actually yield in his tuning a Buzurg at 135-225-135 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interestingly a central tone around 44/39 does seem to occur in a<br/>&gt; measured performance by setar master Ahmad Ebadi as reported by Jean<br/>&gt; During, with steps of about 140.7-209.7-140.7 cents.</p><p>Would it suggest something like a 143 : 132 : 117 : 108 (or reverse) ?</p><p>&gt; Whatever kind of an Esfahan this is, I would, assuming these<br/>&gt; measurements are accurate, call it one shading of the Mohajira we seek<br/>&gt; in traditional practice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If we extend it in the higher tetrachord by a Bayati, this gives<br/>&gt; &gt; again a magnificent Mohajira heptatonic scale I used to call<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Ibina&quot; who is perhaps among all of them, the one I used the most :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 72 : 78 : 88 : 96 : 108 : 117 : 128 : 144<br/>&gt; &gt; (1/1 13/12 11/9 4/3 3/2 13/8 16/9 2/1)<br/>&gt; &gt; (the reference tone, for the classic mode J T J T J T J,<br/>&gt; shifted to 117...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And its mode from 96 = Mustaqim...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is indeed a magnificent scale and a wonderful connection to Ibn<br/>&gt; Sina! Here is a tempered version in Peppermint, a 24-note tuning based<br/>&gt; on Keenan Pepper&apos;s regular temperament at 704.096 cents (using two<br/>&gt; 12-note chains at 58.68 cents apart for some just 7/6 thirds), which<br/>&gt; shades the 16/9 to something very close to a 39/22:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! pep_dudon_ibina_E.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Peppermint tempering of Dudon&apos;s Ibina: 72:78:88:96:108:117:128:144<br/>&gt; 7<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 138.20166<br/>&gt; 346.39287<br/>&gt; 495.90439<br/>&gt; 704.09561<br/>&gt; 842.29727<br/>&gt; 991.80879<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This tetrachord list also shows the use of prime limit 59 that<br/>&gt; &gt; completes the two other major ingredients (besides 3), 11 and 13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Might 23 sometimes arise? I reflect here on 23:16 (628 cents, close to<br/>&gt; the 56:39 in Buzurg) or 23:14 (a larger neutral sixth at 859 cents,<br/>&gt; a tad wider than 64:39), for example.</p><p>I don&apos;t recall 23 coming in these series except in 161 (=7*23) in the series from 13, another famous meantone between 144 and 180.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In the Mohajira series &quot;issued from 13&quot; : 18 22 26 32 39 48 59 72 &gt; 88,<br/>&gt; &gt; 59 appears to have a transition role between 11 and 13 in<br/>&gt; &gt; regard of differential coherence, expressed by the neutral thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; difference tones and equal-beating properties :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 59 - 48 = 11<br/>&gt; &gt; 72 - 59 = 13<br/>&gt; &gt; (or in the equal-beating form) :<br/>&gt; &gt; 11*22 - 4*59 = 9*22 - 4*48 = 3*(4*72 - 11*26) = 3*(4*59 - 9*26) = 6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could this be another instance where &quot;spectrum coherence,&quot; the<br/>&gt; proximity of 64:59 to 13:12 and 59:54 to 12:11, somehow relates to<br/>&gt; these -c connections?</p><p>There would be a relation whenever a generating sequence would pass by these intervals. And this is the case, as they are part of the same tetrachords and issued from the same series.</p><p>&gt; Also, I notice that the differences in the series sum up lots of the<br/>&gt; relevant prime factors or their multiples:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 18 22 26 32 39 48 59 72 88<br/>&gt; 4 4 6 7 9 11 13 16</p><p>That&apos;s precisely what the -c algorithm of this sequence is based on :<br/>m^5 -m^4 = 1/2<br/>(there are also many other algorithms that can apply for mohajira temperaments)</p><p>&gt; Indeed 4:6:7:9:11:13 is a hexad summing up the main harmonic factors<br/>&gt; in lots of tuning systems I use! A small point is that each pair of<br/>&gt; adjacent terms define the ratio of a neutral third -- except for 22:26<br/>&gt; or 13:11, one of my favorite sizes for a regular minor third.</p><p>Convergent series always start from diverging intervals, that sometimes give interesting surprises.<br/>The repetition of 18 : 22  in 72 : 88 is a lucky one !<br/>I never used 7 in this series, but that&apos;s an idea, and it appears later in 161 and 441.</p><p>&gt; &gt; While 24-EDO, 31-EDO then 55-EDO would be the three main cycling<br/>&gt; &gt; attractors of the fractal generator, your mention of 44-EDO is also<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting for 13 steps would amount to a quasi 27/22 ; however I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t consider it to be typically representative of a Mohajira<br/>&gt; &gt; sequence, as there are different models for generators past the<br/>&gt; &gt; half of a pure fifth and around 27/22 one of them is &quot;Zalarith&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; whose sequence is 8x^2 - 9x = 1 and based on the -c of 12/11, but<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s another story, and already a few teapots away !...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, most of my experience has been with temperaments around<br/>&gt; 704-705 cents where a Mohajira mode or chain of generators involves<br/>&gt; two unequal neutral thirds, for example 341-363 cents at 704.607<br/>&gt; cents. Your Soria 17+2 versions, while far more intricate, do seem to<br/>&gt; have a kindred spirit, as well as things like hemifourths that i miss<br/>&gt; in such regular schemes.

This involves what is sometimes called the<br/>&quot;Arab fundamental scale&quot; of disjunct Rast, with note names sometimes<br/>reflecting their order in this scheme, with each step either a tone or<br/>a Zalzalian or neutral second, with D-Ep and A-Bp often understood to<br/>be larger than Ep-F or Bp-C, with JL and Js showing these larger and<br/>smaller neutral steps:</p><p>        T     JL     Js      T      T     JL    Js<br/>     C      D     Ep      F      G      A     Bp    C<br/>    rast  dukah  sikah jaharkah nawa huseyni awj  kirdan</p><p>Here dukah, sikah, and jahargah are Arabic forms of the Persian names<br/>for the &quot;second,&quot; &quot;third,&quot; and &quot;fourth&quot; notes.

It is also possible, however, to<br/>divide it into a lower Sikah pentachord plus an upper &grave;Iraq<br/>tetrachord, the latter a form of Mohajira.</p><p>To explain the name &grave;Iraq, we should note that this tetrachord found<br/>within the fundamental Rast scale starts on Bp, the step a smaller<br/>neutral second below rast or C and often leading up to it -- known as<br/>awj in the octave above rast, but &grave;iraq an octave lower.</p><p>In the usual trichord-tetrachord-trichord division, and in practice, a<br/>lot of the emphasis is placed on Rast tetrachords. Thus Mohajira as a<br/>distinct jins or genre may not be so evident, but it isn&apos;t because of<br/>any problem with the J T or Sikah trichord.</p><p>This leads us to Maqam &grave;Iraq, a close relative of Maqam Sikah and a<br/>frequent modulation when within it.</p><p>Arab theorists sometimes point out that we can derive this maqam by<br/>rotation if we start on the seventh step of Rast -- awj, which is<br/>known an octave lower, or a neutral second below rast, as &grave;iraq, the<br/>final of this maqam bearing its name.

You may notice that the<br/>structure is rather like that of Segah Dastgah. In fact, the lower<br/>tetrachord is recognized in theory as &grave;Iraq, or in our terms a form of<br/>Mohajira; but the usual division often emphasizes other ajnas (genres,<br/>the Arabic plural of jins).

There are two different ways for a neutral third to be -c in a chain of neutral third, that determines two radically different types of them :<br/>1) in the smaller type (typically 11/9), Ep - C = Bb/16 or 11 - 9 = 2 = one full tone under the 1st note ;<br/>2) in the larger type (typically 59/48 or 16/13), Ep - C = Bp/16 or 59 -48 = 11 = one neutral second under the 1st note.<br/>That is why JI versions of Mohajira series, that often alternate these two types, are among the best solutions.<br/>Now if we consider what seventh (Bb or Bp) occurs in the context of such scales, this gives serious indications of pertinent -c models, which are those I recommend, as you understood.<br/>The problem is that when you ask to an Arabian musician what seventh would be pertinent in the context of a trichord like Sikah, or any tetrachord, he thinks the question inappropriate. I believe myself, and like indians do in the raga context, that some &quot;non-played&quot; notes can have an importance. Even if not played, a second tetrachord, naturally suggested by the voice or instrument&apos;s 3rd harmonics, is another example of &quot;non-played&quot;contextual importance.<br/>In Vietnamese music, in various blues scales, etc. quartertones generated by the smaller type of neutral third often occur in contexts where a full tone under the 1st note is found.<br/>etc...<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
