And the<br/>&gt; possiblity that other parts of the repertoire were<br/>&gt; extinguished and that this didn&apos;t happen in the Byzantian<br/>&gt; empire.</p><p>Good stuff, Klaus!  I&apos;m interested in this too, especially<br/>the role Charlemagne apparently played in trying to homogenize<br/>the chant as it existed in the Frankish empire.  The bits<br/>I&apos;ve read about the rustic &quot;vulgarities&quot; in the chant in<br/>local Frankish churches during that time are tantalizing.<br/>Based on my studies of the _musica enchiriadis_, I think<br/>that chant may have had a 5-limit basis, perhaps even 7.</p><p>It was Charlemagne&apos;s goal to eliminate this vagaries, so<br/>I wonder what the rustic chant was really like, and I&apos;ve<br/>often thought that Byzantine chant probably holds part of<br/>the answer, but I&apos;ve never looked into it seriously.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
