Or yours.)</p><p>But that is one of the most important questions, in my opinion.<br/>All-purpose instruments like the cello and the trombone are great, but<br/>all the other &quot;standardized&quot; instruments are designed around meantone<br/>temperament (the temperament in which 3 4/3 perfect fourths exceed an<br/>octave by a 6/5 minor third) and its incarnation in 12-edo.

I&apos;d<br/>&gt; like to see the piano (not to mention pipe organ) capable of 144-ET.<br/>&gt; If we are going to select pitches from this scale to approximate a<br/>&gt; 7/6, why not simply use a 7/6? Are theoretically endless modulations<br/>&gt; into remote keys the goal? Just how many intervals can dance on the<br/>&gt; head of a pin, anyway?</p><p>Needless to say, different musicians have different goals. The desire<br/>for purity of intervals and the desire for freedom of modulation are<br/>incompatible, but they create a continuum between just intonation and<br/>equal temperaments.

I&apos;d tell<br/>&gt; you to check the archives, but until yahoo ugrades their search,<br/>&gt; such efforts are sadly unlikely to bear much fruit.</p><p>I&apos;ll briefly try to summarize my contributions on this point.</p><p>1. As Kraig says, we need to build new instruments.  He&apos;s<br/>done pretty well on that count, as did Partch.  Partch left us<br/>a great manual on how to do it...<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030680106X/">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030680106X/</a></p><p>Efforts have been made to design new orchestral instruments<br/>(Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos;s work comes to mind<br/><a href="http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a> ) and to find new<br/>ways of playing traditional ones (Johnny Reinhard and others).</p><p>But as far as I&apos;m concerned, creating fixed-pitch instruments<br/>to guide us is priority one (I&apos;ve said that Western music is<br/>only 12-tET to the extent pianos and guitars are 12-tET).<br/>That means guitars and keyboards.  In the guitar dept., it&apos;s<br/>straightforward to make equal temperaments up to 31, and from<br/>there approximate what you need.  Dave Keenan also showed how<br/>to lay out microtemperaments for practical JI on guitar...<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf</a></p><p>In the keyboard department, the halberstadt simply has to go.<br/>The Fokker organ and generalized-keyboard Scalatron (George<br/>Secor can tell you all about it) were unique points in history<br/>here, but we&apos;re now looking down the face of at least three<br/>major breakthroughs:</p><p>- Dylan Horvath&apos;s Terpstra keyboard<br/><a href="http://www.cortex-design.com/body-project-terpstra-5.htm">http://www.cortex-design.com/body-project-terpstra-5.htm</a></p><p>- Paul Vandervoort&apos;s Daskin keyboard<br/><a href="http://www.daskin.com">http://www.daskin.com</a></p><p>- the Thummer jammer<br/><a href="http://www.thummer.com">http://www.thummer.com</a></p><p>Starr Labs&apos; microzone keyboards have been available for a<br/>few years...<br/><a href="http://www.starrlabs.com">http://www.starrlabs.com</a><br/>...but are much more expensive than the three above projects<br/>are aiming to be.</p><p>2. And indeed, in my mind, ignorance of intonation subtleties<br/>in existing musical forms is a huge problem in the microtonal<br/>community.  It&apos;s something of a myth that &quot;microtonality&quot;<br/>requires greater precision, for all those microscopic things,<br/>than standard music.  Sure it&apos;s possible to write music that<br/>uses tiny intervals or explores new levels of subtlety.  But<br/>I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the most interesting ground uncovered by<br/>microtonal theory.  Rather, a serious palette of new scales,<br/>with 5-12 notes, have been uncovered with vastly different<br/>behavior than the diatonic scale.  New chord progressions,<br/>new chord types, new melodic flavors.  Too bad so few people<br/>on these lists have bothered to check them out.</p><p>3. While less interactive than the new instruments discussed<br/>above, electronic renderings can be useful in the acoustic<br/>realm.  Toby Twining used them to guide live performers for<br/>his Crysalid Requiem (discussed here and on MMM at length).</p><p>4. Musical traditions take time to evolve.  While they take<br/>less time today than ever before, we should be happy if we<br/>only see 5% of the fruits of today&apos;s theory in our lifetimes.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2006 11:27:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll briefly try to summarize my contributions on this point.</p><p>Excellent post, very well done.

But that creates another set of problems: intonational<br/>&gt; subtleties (see below). How many discrete pitches can such an<br/>&gt; instrument produce - in order to accommodate the multitude of<br/>&gt; tunings required of it - before becoming too<br/>&gt; physically/mechanically cumbersome?</p><p>Pianos can be built with 31 pitches/octave and still have the<br/>octave span about the same as on a conventional piano.<br/>Harpsichords can be made even smaller.  I dunno about tracker<br/>organs, but the sky&apos;s the limit with &apos;trackless&apos; ones.  And<br/>that raises the notion of &apos;play by wire&apos; pianos, with cases<br/>of strings actuated by solenoids...  And synthesizers have no<br/>mechanical problems at all.  Yes, I know synths aren&apos;t acoustic,<br/>but they could still serve to guide acoustic performers, and<br/>most importantly of all, provide a visual &amp; auditory framework<br/>in which composers can think.</p><p>And let&apos;s not leave out button accordions.  The parts can be<br/>made very small.</p><p>As for physical limitations, keyboards are apparently feasible<br/>up to 41 pitches/octave, and probably beyond.  There&apos;s some<br/>debate about where polyphonic guitar playing becomes impossible.<br/>Perhaps around 31, perhaps around 53...</p><p>And these are notes *at a time*.  One can retune his piano,<br/>switch guitars, or switch out magnetic fretboards (Mark Rankin),<br/>or retune his synth instantly.  Further subtleties can be<br/>reached with automatic intonation of some kind and/or by<br/>letting the performer choose roots with pedals.</p><p>So I&apos;m not sure what you think is &quot;required&quot;, but here I don&apos;t<br/>see any &quot;problem&quot;.  Rather, I see an *embarrassment of riches*.</p><p>&gt; That still leaves the question of woodwinds and brass -<br/>&gt; which have a certain amount of intonational leeway - and tuned<br/>&gt; percussion instruments. I would hate to abandon these vital<br/>&gt; tone-colors for a music comprised of only guitars, strings<br/>&gt; and pianos.</p><p>Who said anything about that?  I said making pianos is the way<br/>to get microtonal brass.

So, at the point the melody moves from<br/>&gt; the lower to the upper, there is a distinct change of<br/>&gt; mood.  Actually, one can analyse this tune as having<br/>&gt; two distinct portions, the first having a span of a<br/>&gt; seventh rooted on E, and the second having a span of<br/>&gt; a seventh, rooted on A.  In each part, the &quot;essential<br/>&gt; span&quot; of the melody is only a fifth, the upper two<br/>&gt; notes serving only as parts of an extended ornament.<br/>&gt; On this analaysis, the tune as a whole does have a<br/>&gt; change of mode, from E Phrygian to A (?, minor), and<br/>&gt; one can certainly call this &quot;modulation&quot; - even more so<br/>&gt; if one chooses to harmonise the two parts with E<br/>&gt; minor, A minor.  So perhaps this round goes to you! :-)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Since you are the arranger, I expect you to harmonise it to disprove my<br/>claims!</p><p>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>O. wizard</p></div><h3>George D.

In the guitar dept., it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; straightforward to make equal temperaments up to 31, and from<br/>&gt; &gt; there approximate what you need.  Dave Keenan also showed how<br/>&gt; &gt; to lay out microtemperaments for practical JI on guitar...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More fixed-pitch instruments does seem to be the most direct route.<br/>&gt; But that creates another set of problems: intonational subtleties<br/>&gt; (see below). How many discrete pitches can such an instrument<br/>&gt; produce - in order to accommodate the multitude of tunings required<br/>&gt; of it - before becoming too physically/mechanically cumbersome?<br/>&gt; Keyboards can be retuned (I have a thought on that, but later);<br/>&gt; guitars and bowed strings can return to the use of moveable frets<br/>or<br/>&gt; ligatures.
