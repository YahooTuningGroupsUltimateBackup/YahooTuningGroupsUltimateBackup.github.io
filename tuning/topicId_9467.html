It is free with a<br/>membership in the Just Intonation Network. Here is the info from their web<br/>site (<a href="http://www.dnai.com:80/~jinetwk/">http://www.dnai.com:80/~jinetwk/</a>):</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>------</p><p>To Order The Just Intonation Primer</p><p>The Just Intonation Primer is available exclusively from the Just<br/>Intonation Network. The primer is offered free with a new membership in the<br/>network (Individuals: $17.50 U.S./$20.00 Canada and Mexico/$25.00<br/>elsewhere; institutional $30.00). New members please include postage and<br/>handling (sse below). Membership also includes four issues of the network&apos;s<br/>journal, 1/1, and discounts on books and recordings from The Just<br/>Intonation Store. The primer is priced at $8.00 for current Just Intonation<br/>Network members and $10.00 for the general public, plus postage and<br/>handling (U.S.: $1.50./Canada and Mexico: $3.50/All others: $5.00)</p><p>Make Checks Payable to:<br/>The Just Intonation Network<br/>535 Stevenson Street<br/>San Francisco, CA 94013</p><p>For orders from outside the U.S., please send a check or money order in<br/>U.S. dollars drawn on a U.S. bank. Sorry, no credit card orders or orders<br/>via the web (yet).</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>------</p><p>To get a taste, you can view the first chapter from this web site, but<br/>things like lattice diagrams are discussed later in the book. It&apos;s very<br/>readable and the best simple introduction to this topic. Of course it<br/>doesn&apos;t go into equal or other temperaments, but it does answer most of the<br/>mathematics/notation questions you mention.</p><p>Other good books are Harry Partch&apos;s _Genesis of a Music_, which is a much<br/>more detailed, idiosyncratic view of just intonation; Murray Barbour&apos;s<br/>_Tuning and Temperament: An Historical Survey_, which is still probably the<br/>best survey of the history of European tuning systems, despite its<br/>lamentable bias towards 12TET (doesn&apos;t really cover the<br/>notation/mathematics questions you ask, though); and John Chalmer&apos;s<br/>_Divisions of the Tetrachord_, a stunningly comprehensive survey of<br/>different tuning systems from the tetrachordal perspective, together with<br/>the mathematics, history, etc.</p><p>Best of luck.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
