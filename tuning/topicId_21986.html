But it happened recently (no longer the most recent issue).  I&apos;ve not seen mention of it elsewhere on this list, so here goes.<br/>The magazine is &quot;Listener&quot;, subtitled Hi-Fi and Music Review.  The issue is March-April 2001, otherwise Vol. 7, No.2, published by Englander Communications, LLC, 75 Holly Hill Lane, Greenwich, CT 06830.<br/>I&apos;ve subscribed for just about a year now and expect to renew, even though I&apos;d never expect them to top this.  The newsstand price is $5.95.  This is a &quot;Reader&apos;s Digest&quot; size magazine, running to 128 pages.<br/>There are nine of the stock black and white photos of Harry and instruments, including three of the CRI CD covers, reduced to a rather small size, but nicely supplemented by one of the Zymo-Xyl in color on the contents page.  Author Elliott Kallen is very positive and sympathetic, which reviews of Partch&apos;s music in the hi-fi press have not always been.  The article runs to four and a half pages of text and photos and is a good, concise summary for those unfamiliar with the subject, including recommended recordings to start with plus capsules of the CRI series of four and three of the Innova &quot;Enclosures&quot; series.  There are no revelations here for the cognoscenti, but a few points worth bringing out.  For example, during a span of sixteen years Partch moved fifteen times!  And, some of the 1950&apos;s master tapes were made at 15 ips in stereo, so these are only recently available other than in the original mono LP format.  Only Gilmore&apos;s book is mentioned, but this is excusable as the others have more depth than most would care to plumb.<br/>This is one of a number of lesser-known publications in this field, some of which go back many years now.  I don&apos;t follow them all, but this is the first I can recall of any mention of Partch outside of the high volume types such as Stereo Review, High Fidelity and Audio (the latter two now defunct).</p></div><h3><a id=22007 href="#22007">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>5/2/2001 5:33:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John F.
