For instance, you can see that it has a lot of fifths (go right three spaces from any note, except C#r, E, and F#\) and a reasonable number of major and minor thirds. You can also see the melodic arrangement of the five large steps (98.56 cents), which go diagonally up to the right skipping a row (Ebc-E, F/-F#\, Abc-A, Bb/-B\, and C-C#r), and the 11 small steps (64.82 cents). You could look at the mathematical definition of the tuning and calculate what intervals are tempered out from that, but it&apos;s so much easier just to look at a chart like this and visualize the chord patterns (once you become familiar with the basic intervals).
