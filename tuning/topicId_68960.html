They are not that significant to<br/>me,  musically as are the Brandenberg Concerti.  The Tocatta and Fugue for<br/>organ has greater power for me, and I always  crack a smile at the Coffee<br/>Cantata.  I just think the books were more for setting up technique for the  student,<br/>with the tuning a good excuse for arrangement.

They are in<br/>dissertations.  Since I am  researching, I am asserting, Barbour has not been<br/>challenged to say that Bach  needs a well-temperament for the great majority<br/>of his organ compositions.  You&rsquo;ll have to accept this, unless wants  to<br/>challenge this.<br/>Secondly, the choice of tuning  effects a piece in most any key that has any<br/>chromatic extensions.  There is always the run of alternatively  large/small<br/>semitones, for example.<br/>And thirdly, I just don&rsquo;t think JS  needed to have several WTs.  He had  one<br/>single favorite WT.  He could  write for other tunings, but he had one single<br/>favorite WT.  This great organist&rsquo;s organ tuning would  determine his favorite<br/>WT.  His  favorite WT on organ would be the tuning he would prefer for the<br/>harpsichord or  the clavichord.  The WTC only rounds  the bend for the hands to<br/>mature in their technique, something JS is renown for,  while ALSO aiding the<br/>ears, and the mind.<br/>All best,  Johnny</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2007 7:11:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 15 Ocak 2007 Pazartesi 4:25<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: taking Bach as a microtonalist seriously</p><p>  Dear Ozan, I don&apos;t think Aaron needs your encouragement!</p><p>He certainly does not.

At least that helps explain a second book of TWTC.</p><p>Since you are not a keyboardist by profession, let us keyboard players be the judge of that.</p><p>  Ozan:  By all means, I am inclined to believe that all well-temperaments would work<br/>  in the case of WTC. There might be merit, of course, for the usage of<br/>  Werckmeister III here too, but is it really the only well-temperament that<br/>  Bach would endorse?</p><p>  Johnny:  What you are resisting is my tying Bach&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 2 books of the Well-tempered Clavier with the majority of his works.  They are not that significant to me, musically as are the Brandenberg Concerti.  The Tocatta and Fugue for organ has greater power for me, and I always crack a smile at the Coffee Cantata.  I just think the books were more for setting up technique for the student, with the tuning a good excuse for arrangement.  The sentiment issue is much, much, much stronger in the Passions, and these have never been recorded for release in anything but ET, to my knowledge.</p><p>I assume Bach would not have cared much about what the temperament was as long as it was &quot;wohl&quot;, or even &quot;ordinaire&quot;. Besides, is it entirely implausible that he would want to liberate himself from a fixed clavier tuning in his daring orchestrations?</p><p>  Ozan:  If the majority of Bach&apos;s works show little usage of keys with 5-7 sharps<br/>  and flats, then I would be inclined to think that even meantone would be<br/>  acceptable for several concerti grossi, masses, organ works, the lot...<br/>  Cordially, Oz.</p><p>  Johnny:  Firstly, these things have all been studied already.  They are in dissertations.  Since I am researching, I am asserting, Barbour has not been challenged to say that Bach needs a well-temperament for the great majority of his organ compositions.  You&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll have to accept this, unless wants to challenge this.</p><p>I only accept what makes sense. It is possible for Bach to have reserved the question of temperament for keyboard alone, and a particular well-temperament specifically for his 48 Preludes and Fugues. I am more inclined to imagine that he did not worry greatly about pitch-deviations in his other works for chamber, concerti and choir.</p><p>  Secondly, the choice of tuning effects a piece in most any key that has any chromatic extensions.  There is always the run of alternatively large/small semitones, for example.</p><p>So, you think that Bach would compose in nothing but a solitary well-temperament?</p><p>  And thirdly, I just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think JS needed to have several WTs.  He had one single favorite WT.  He could write for other tunings, but he had one single favorite WT.  This great organist&acirc;&euro;&trade;s organ tuning would determine his favorite WT.  His favorite WT on organ would be the tuning he would prefer for the harpsichord or the clavichord.  The WTC only rounds the bend for the hands to mature in their technique, something JS is renown for, while ALSO aiding the ears, and the mind.</p><p>I find grave problems in your reductive reasoning. Why would Bach choose only one tuning when a plethora of nicely working temperaments enriched the Baroque tradition across Europe? And why would he settle for a single tuning for both the harpsichord and the church organ when these instruments are so contrasting in timbre? And so many more questions ad infinitum...</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2007 8:32:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Every piece by Bach is for keyboard music, with  but few exceptions.<br/>&gt; Contrary to whatever you may have heard, a musician  with flexible<br/>pitch must use the<br/>&gt; instrument present -- the continuo -- as the  rule of law regarding<br/>the<br/>&gt; correct intonation.</p><p>I really doubt singers are singing in Werck3 just because there is a<br/>keyboard in the room, or even plunking away in the background.

I&apos;ve just done a little checking of my<br/>terminology, and what I refer to as &quot;adaptive harmonic tuning&quot; might<br/>better be referred to as JI with modulation where necessary.

At least now I understand why you&apos;re dismissing my<br/>ideas - my use of the term &apos;adaptive&apos; seems to have been a mistake.<br/>What I mean by &quot;adaptive&quot; is simply that there isn&apos;t a set,<br/>unchangeable frequency defined for each note in the scale. For a note<br/>to vary in pitch as it is sounded, unless dictated by the music (eg<br/>glissando or vibrato) is in my opinion a mistake. Adaptive tuning, to<br/>me, simply means that the tuning of a note depends on harmonic<br/>context.

If you have never<br/>sung a large work in WIII, but only in ET, then it is unlikely you<br/>will understand what I am getting at.  Sorry.</p><p>Patrick: Except when we had to sing with the organ, we never sang in<br/>ET. On the other hand, we never sang any other temperament at all (and<br/>at the time I had barely even heard of WIII). We didn&apos;t bother to give<br/>a name to what you would probably refer to as adaptive JI - we were<br/>aware that we weren&apos;t singing &apos;piano tuning&apos;, but we just sang<br/>properly in tune (with some direction from our highly talented<br/>choirmaster where necessary). For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;m not surprised<br/>if a choir had trouble singing in a temperament other than ET.</p><p>--</p><p>Johnny:  And I am only talking about Bach.  I would love to hear about<br/>specific a cappella Bach, music intended sung without Continuo.  Could<br/>you help?</p><p>Patrick: I&apos;m afraid not. I left that choir at the end of 2005, and<br/>left most of the sheet music behind. Why is it that you restrict your<br/>enquiry to a cappella Bach, though? My initial point was that the<br/>tuning of the continuo does not dictate the tuning of other parts, and<br/>so far you have not even addressed it.</p><p>--</p><p>Patrick: In light of the source I quote above, it seems rather<br/>plausible that that &quot;aesthetic of the past&quot; bears a close resemblance<br/>to &quot;modern&quot; practice.</p><p>Johnny:  There is much that happened before Helmoltz.  Even if<br/>Helmholtz had the musicianly skills to determine what was being done<br/>by musicians, this is WAY too late for Bach.</p><p>Patrick: What happened before Helmholtz, then? Specifically, what<br/>happened before Delezenne? What exactly was Helmholtz missing?<br/>Delezenne&apos;s results are quite straight-forward, as are Helmholtz&apos;s own<br/>- how much musicianship is required to determine the pitches of notes<br/>in a scale played by someone else? Can you offer some evidence on any<br/>of this, to support your own assertions or to contradict my own?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Patrick</p></div><h3>p_heddles &#x3C;p_heddles@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2007 11:24:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;p_heddles&quot; &lt;p_heddles@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Incidentally, I&apos;ve a general question for you and for the other list<br/>&gt; &gt; members: what *is* the ultimate aim of tuning?

What I have seen on this list recently  is an<br/>often-heated debate on the merits of Werck III as the single  correct<br/>tuning for Bach&apos;s music, with you on one side and everyone else on  the<br/>other. I may not post often, but I do read most of what others post  on<br/>this list (and have done for a few years now).</p><p>Johnny:  No Patrick, WIII has always been part of  discussions about Bach on<br/>this List, at least since I have been a correspondent  (ten years now?).  This<br/>is the free exchange of ideas in the service of the  truth.  In part, it<br/>stems from my early research while a grad student at  Columbia University.  I<br/>wrote a paper called &quot;Bach&apos;s Tuning&quot; and have used  my resources to experiment.  I<br/>am presenting my conclusions.  It  doesn&apos;t really matter if no one agrees<br/>with me, since that is the whole reason I  passionately respond to the issues<br/>that people bring up.  I&apos;m shining a  light.</p><p>Please, let us return to the issues.  Bach works  today in any tuning because<br/>he is Bach, the consummate composer.  However,  if Bach used a single WT for<br/>his greatest music, and it offered a new  dimension to his music, a passionate<br/>musician would seek it out and use  it.  My idea is that Bach&apos;s music needs<br/>to be understood in its  cultural context.  Throwing in personal likes of<br/>moderns moves further from  the concern stated above.</p><p>One thing now seems very clear; people are very emotional  about this.  One<br/>thing I cannot accept is the poor treatment given Andreas  Werckmeister and his<br/>writings.  He was a good man.  If not for him,  who knows how music would be<br/>different.  For about 8 years, this List has  been following the thread of<br/>WIII for Bach.  The bad treatment I get, and  other people on this List, and<br/>others on other Lists, get from speaking their  mind with good intentions is<br/>example enough of what Werckmeister went  through.  Yes, I guess you could say he<br/>is a musical hero of mine.</p><p>And while I agree with you, Patrick, that Bach did not use  ET, other WTs are<br/>rare (noodles) to non-existent (meantone).</p><p>Patrick:   Adaptive tuning, to<br/>me, simply  means that the tuning of a note depends on harmonic<br/>context. A good enough  singer can hit the appropriate pitch<br/>immediately, and a singer who isn&apos;t good  enough either improves<br/>quickly or leaves the choir (I improved  quickly).</p><p>Johnny: This is not about skills, it is about an old  tradition that has been<br/>buried by musicologists.  I can speak towards NYC,  but there are lots of<br/>other places out there, and I await to hear of anything  else.  Other than<br/>released recordings, there is only hearsay that has been  presented.  WIII does not<br/>do well with too much harmonic context.  I  did what I could as alto recorder<br/>soloist in the aforementioned &quot;Brandenberg  #2.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s related, but when 18 year old Bach was  adjudicating the<br/>Arnstadt organ in 1703 tuned by Wender, reputedly in WIII,  there was only one<br/>tuning published for chromatic playing, even if  others were thought about by<br/>some individuals.  The question I raise is  whether WIII sufficed for Bach as<br/>appropriate for his chromatic music.</p><p>--</p><p>Patrick:  For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;m not  surprised<br/>if a choir had trouble singing in a temperament other than  ET.</p><p>Johnny: Sometimes people with perfect pitch have trouble  singing non-ET for<br/>the first time.  They seem to snap into the old  positions much like an old<br/>piano that has been retuned snaps back to its  familiar pitches (positions).<br/>Most people have no trouble, at least in the  sense that there is no need for<br/>any extra  rehearsals.<br/>--</p><p>Patrick:  Why is it that you restrict  your<br/>enquiry to a cappella Bach, though? My initial point was that  the<br/>tuning of the continuo does not dictate the tuning of other parts,  and<br/>so far you have not even addressed it.</p><p>Johnny:  I asked about a cappella because there is no  keyboard.  Contrary to<br/>your experience of adaptive JI, I do not believe  that is what Bach did.  The<br/>tuning WIII virtually prohibits it.  With  4 major thirds 6 cents apart, and<br/>other intervals similarly 6 cents apart, there  seems to be a requirement for<br/>a different performance practice for WIII.   Please consider this as WIII<br/>specific when I write about Bach.</p><p>Before Helmholtz, there was plenty, all sorts of meantone,  extended meantone<br/>(with extra notes played by non-fixed instruments),  idiosyncratics,<br/>approximations (even to ET, no doubt), variants by  Werckmeister.

Back when I was writing in 12-ET, I found myself drawn to unusual scales, trying to explore areas of tonality that were more exotic than the kind of harmony that&apos;s generally taught in music theory classes. I&apos;d heard a performance by Owen Jorgensen demonstrating some of the different historical temperaments, along with his unusual &quot;5 and 7&quot; temperament, with the white keys tuned in 7-ET and the black keys in 5-ET. I also became interested in the gamelan music of Indonesia and ran across a copy of Colin McPhee&apos;s _Music in Bali_ in the university library. So it was only natural that I started examining different systems of tuning and using them in my own music.</p><p>It was around that time that Wendy Carlos&apos; album _Beauty in the Beast_ came out, which was really the thing that convinced me of the vast unexplored potentials in the area of musical tuning. It even featured an excerpt of authentic Balinese gamelan music arranged for the digital synthesizer! Later, Easley Blackwood&apos;s _Microtonal_ album (which I found out about from Scott R. Wilkinson&apos;s book _Tuning In_) convinced me that even the &quot;bad&quot; tunings which look unimpressive on paper have their own distinct character which can create particular moods that don&apos;t work as well in other tunings.</p><p>The CDs I have of music in historical tunings sound notably better to me than the modern 12-ET tuning for that style of music. I also collect CDs of music from around the world, which offer a variety of interesting scales and tunings. But that barely begins to scratch the surface of the possibilities, so I started getting interested in the theory behind it all.</p></div><h3>p_heddles &#x3C;p_heddles@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2007 6:43:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Patrick: Non-fretted strings can, in the hands of a reasonably<br/>skilled player, play fully chromatically - as far as I&apos;m aware, they<br/>also use adaptive harmonic tuning by default.</p><p>&gt;Johnny: Yes, but MODERN string players.

A good enough singer can hit the<br/>appropriate pitch immediately, and a singer who isn&apos;t good enough<br/>either improves quickly or leaves the choir (I improved quickly).</p><p>&gt;Johnny: This is not about skills, it is about an old tradition that<br/>has been buried by musicologists.</p><p>&gt;Patrick: I was merely dispelling your apparent misconception that<br/>&quot;adaptive tuning&quot; somehow meant sliding up or down to a note.

Temperaments are by definition unnatural - ET<br/>comes easily to a singer because we&apos;re all immersed in it, but I&apos;ve<br/>never yet heard a choir sing in a temperament other than ET. I&apos;d be<br/>quite surprised if they managed it without significant trouble, and<br/>I&apos;d be very interested to see a Fourier analysis of what pitches<br/>they&apos;re actually singing while singing with WIII-tuned instruments.</p><p>--</p><p>&gt;Patrick:  Why is it that you restrict your<br/>enquiry to a cappella Bach, though?

None of them<br/>seems remotely relevant to the JI that Delezenne and Helmholtz both<br/>observed. Given that JI is the original tuning in Western music and<br/>that all &apos;standard&apos; temperaments (ie excluding the exotic tunings<br/>played with by other list members) are fundamentally just attempts to<br/>solve the comma problem in JI, on what basis do you suggest that JI<br/>was abandoned sometime before Bach&apos;s time and then revived between<br/>Bach&apos;s time and Delezenne&apos;s?

Werckmeister himself said that certain of his<br/>other tunings were more  appropriate than WIII in some cases, and at<br/>least some of Bach&apos;s music was  never intended to be performed in a<br/>tempered tuning at all.</p><p>Johnny:  Yes, use of other Werckmeister is  certainly a possibility, except<br/>when Bach goes into the well temperament  area.  This is where a Bb is the<br/>same pitch as an A#.  If there are  more pitches written than there are keys to<br/>play them, the music is deemed in  well temperament.  Werckmeister gave  a<br/>single variant for chromatic writing.  Patrick, don&rsquo;t you understand there was a<br/>single tuning for the kind of  composer that Bach was?  Sure, Bach  could use<br/>the others, or other tunings, but the timing is such that WIII is a  natural.<br/>Most important, modern music has set  a default of ET for Bach, which as you<br/>said, is all you know.  If one could accept that WIII (which all  reasonably<br/>agrees works for Bach) was as good a historic possibility as anything  else,<br/>because it WAS disseminated throughout, and humbly so, then the new  default for<br/>recording and &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; Bach would be a WT (maybe even  WIII).<br/>There are no recordings anyone knows  of in Europe of Bach in anything other<br/>than ET (and rare spurts by Ton  Koopman).  There is little in the  US.  I<br/>think this is an important development  for culture to take in drawing closer to<br/>Bach.  ET is too off the mark.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not even sure you took me at my  meaning when I wrote:<br/>Johnny:   However, Werckmeister is the first to  describe a full<br/>circle of 12 major and minor keys that were equally usable,  and that<br/>mirrored many of the other tunings, including just and pythagorean  and ET.</p><p>&gt;Patrick: So your entire response presupposes that you are  correct?<br/>Johnny:  What I wrote in the paragraph above is  historical, its not opinion.<br/> If you  had some more familiarity with WIII you would understand that each<br/>key is  completely different from the other; they have different size<br/>intervals.<br/>Patrick:  You refer to &quot;what Bach did&quot;.

I do not believe that if they  used WIII in the larger pieces,<br/>passions, etc., there would be enough wiggle  room to do much.  Bach was the<br/>real  control freak in this conversation.  I see WT as providing an illusion<br/>for the keyboard to appear as  expressive melodically as a violin.<br/>Patrick:  Even for pieces involving keyboard, he  could tune the keyboard<br/>but not the other instruments; they merely needed to  use tuning(s)<br/>which fitted with the keyboard&apos;s tuning at each moment.

It&rsquo;s a really big deal if you can&rsquo;t<br/>get  all the pitches that the keyboard has.  With the confidence of matching<br/>the keyboard exactly, a player can  provide another dimension.  Mozart  wrote<br/>in a letter of a soprano who could stay an exact quartertone above the  entire<br/>orchestra, and that this got her the big money!</p><p>You&rsquo;ve asked about how tuning  started in Just and then went out of Just and<br/>then came back for Helmholtz.

I would<br/>appreciate it.</p><p>&gt;Patrick: To be honest, I&apos;m no expert on Bach&apos;s a cappella chorales<br/>myself. My point, and the reason I stated this unequivocally before<br/>looking into specific chorales, is that no choir would have sung an a<br/>cappella piece in any temperament at all before ET became so<br/>pervasive. To a singer such as myself, the concept is absurd.</p><p>I suggest &quot;185 Bach Chorales&quot; (BWV 254). It is available from CPDL at<br/><a href="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/185_Bach_Chorales%2C_BWV_254_%28Johann_Sebastian_Bach%29">http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/185_Bach_Chorales%2C_BWV_254_%28Johann_Sebastian_Bach%29</a></p><p>--</p><p>&gt;Johnny: My idea is that Bach&apos;s music needs to be understood in its<br/>cultural context. Throwing in personal likes of moderns moves further<br/>from the concern stated above.</p><p>&gt;Patrick: It is absurd, however, to insist that it is the only<br/>&apos;correct&apos; tuning for any and all music written by Bach.</p><p>&gt;Johnny:  and for the nteenth time, I do not.  Somehow, it seems<br/>further discussion would be deeply improved if you had a chance to<br/>actually hear what I am talking about.</p><p>&gt;Patrick: So precisely what claim are you making for WIII? From<br/>reading this discussion and similar discussions in the past, my<br/>understanding was that you claimed WIII as the only correct tuning for<br/>Bach&apos;s music. If this is not your claim, it would be very helpful for<br/>you to state unequivocally what claims you do and do not make for<br/>WIII. And why would my hearing it make the slightest difference? I<br/>have never suggested that Bach&apos;s music doesn&apos;t sound fine in WIII.</p><p>--</p><p>&gt;Johnny: Patrick, don&apos;t you understand there was a single tuning for<br/>the kind of composer that Bach was?</p><p>&gt;Patrick: In short, no. I understand what you mean, and I disagree. In<br/>the absence of solid evidence, I consider such a claim silly.</p><p>--</p><p>&gt;Johnny: Most important, modern music has set a default of ET for<br/>Bach, which as you said, is all you know.</p><p>&gt;Patrick: So you seek merely to change the default tuning for Bach&apos;s<br/>music from ET to WIII? I have no strong objection to that, although I<br/>will be astounded if it happens. I do suggest you take more care in<br/>stating the limitations of your intent.</p><p>I said what, exactly? Please be a little more careful about what you<br/>ascribe to me - I never said that I had not heard Bach in any tuning<br/>outside ET. I merely said I had not heard it in any temperament other<br/>than ET. There is a big difference between the two statements, given<br/>my stated opinion that many Bach pieces were never intended to be<br/>performed in any tempered tuning at all.</p><p>--</p><p>&gt;Johnny:  What I wrote in the paragraph above is historical, its not<br/>opinion.  If you had some more familiarity with WIII you would<br/>understand that each key is completely different from the other; they<br/>have different size intervals.</p><p>&gt;Patrick: This is a point still under debate here. You modified the<br/>point on the basis of itself. This is a logical fallacy known as<br/>circular reasoning, regardless of how sure you are. First prove the<br/>point, and then use it.</p><p>--</p><p>&gt;Patrick:  You refer to &quot;what Bach did&quot;. I remind you that the tuning<br/>of Bach&apos;s music in his time depended on the performers rather than the<br/>composer.</p><p>&gt;Johnny:  Ah, it would be so much easier if you could just agree with<br/>you.  Alas, I do not believe the performer influenced pitch as freely<br/>today as they did for Bach.  I do not believe that if they used WIII<br/>in the larger pieces, passions, etc., there would be enough wiggle<br/>room to do much.  Bach was the real control freak in this<br/>conversation.  I see WT as providing an illusion for the keyboard to<br/>appear as expressive melodically as a violin.</p><p>Patrick: I think you&apos;ve made a few substitution errrors here, and I<br/>can&apos;t be sure what you mean. Could you please restate this paragraph?</p><p>--</p><p>&gt;Patrick:  Even for pieces involving keyboard, he could tune the<br/>keyboard but not the other instruments; they merely needed to use<br/>tuning(s) which fitted with the keyboard&apos;s tuning at each moment. This<br/>does not require a complete fixed tuning system which is entirely<br/>compatible with WIII.</p><p>&gt;Johnny:  I think it does for woodwinds.  It&apos;s a really big deal if<br/>you can&apos;t get all the pitches that the keyboard has.  With the<br/>confidence of matching the keyboard exactly, a player can provide<br/>another dimension.  Mozart wrote in a letter of a soprano who could<br/>stay an exact quartertone above the entire orchestra, and that this<br/>got her the big money!</p><p>&gt;Patrick: Haven&apos;t we already established that woodwinds are capable of<br/>fully chromatic playing? Do you have any evidence of woodwind<br/>instruments tuned in WIII in Bach&apos;s time? Mozart&apos;s letter is<br/>unsurprising - a musician with such pitch sensitivity and accuracy<br/>would be highly prized.</p><p>--</p><p>Johnny: You&apos;ve asked about how tuning started in Just and then went<br/>out of Just and then came back for Helmholtz.  There is much material<br/>being written about this, more all the time.  But sticking to topic,<br/>JS Bach has always been recognized as the master of temperament,<br/>someone who insisted that all his major thirds be tuned sharp!</p><p>&gt;Patrick: Actually, I dispute that it happened at all for instruments<br/>capable of fully chromatic playing (excluding those occasions when<br/>they played with fixed-pitch instruments, of course). I thought I had<br/>made myself clear on this point.</p><p>And did Bach ever insist that a choir sing a cappella in tempered<br/>tuning? If not, then that little factoid is irrelevant.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Patrick</p></div><h3>p_heddles &#x3C;p_heddles@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2007 9:26:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;p_heddles&quot; &lt;p_heddles@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Given that JI is the original tuning in Western music...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by that?

ET gives too little of the full impression of WT to my ears.</p><p>Please understand, this is NOT about a cappella, not about exceptions.  This is about clearly well tempered compositions with keyboards.   With a WT, each key is different.  For example:</p><p>WIII C major:<br/>0  90   192  294  390  498  588  696  792  888    996  1092</p><p>WIII C# major:<br/>0 102  204  300  408  498  606  702  798  906  1002  1110</p><p>This should help you see that if one starts on a different tonic, the measurements change.  Performance practice in WIII with ensembles has led to some interesting results.  Please, give a listen to some WIII if possible because it will aid in understanding what I had said.
