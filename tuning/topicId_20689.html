In 24-tET, the 5th<br/>harmonic is sharp by 0.27 step, and the 7th harmonic is flat by 0.37 step.<br/>Since these errors are in opposite directions, 24-tET is considered<br/>inconsistent in the 7-limit. If the errors were in the same direction, it<br/>would be considered consistent.</p><p>As Joe Monzo stated, Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos;s paper has the best published<br/>explanation of consistency.</p></div>
