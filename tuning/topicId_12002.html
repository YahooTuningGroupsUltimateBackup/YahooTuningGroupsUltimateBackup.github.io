Wouldn&apos;t it be possible to find, for a given number<br/>of tones, the one scale with the least total dyadic harmonic entropy?<br/>I understand that this might not always be desirable -- when looking<br/>for a local minimum around a certain chord, for example.  But for<br/>finding new scales -- how much did the initial choice of n-tET<br/>influence the results?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
