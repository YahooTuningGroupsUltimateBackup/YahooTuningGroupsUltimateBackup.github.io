The basic idea is to take all the notes that are sounding<br/>&gt;&gt; at any given time and to retune them so as to maximize a measure<br/>&gt;&gt; of &quot;sensory consonance,&quot; or perhaps more properly to minimize the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;sensory dissonance.&quot;</p><p>to which Gene replied:</p><p>&gt;This is funny; I&apos;ve been thinking about doing this very thing, and<br/>&gt;was going to ask over on tuning-math for easily computed smooth<br/>&gt;dissonance functions, and whether critical bands might work better<br/>&gt;for this purpose than plunging into the murky depths of harmonic<br/>&gt;entropy. I am wondering how you deal with a disonnace function whose<br/>&gt;derivative is not monotonic, or am I leaping to conclusions that you<br/>&gt;did things the way I was turning over in my mind? I also wonder if<br/>&gt;you assume a certain timbre in advance.</p><p>Well, hard for me to know what is in your mind... but basically I<br/>parameterized the Plomp-Levelt dissonance curve for pure sine waves<br/>as a difference between 2 exponentials (doing a least squares fit<br/>to find the appropriate parameters). (There are other reasonable<br/>parameterizations, too.) The sensory dissonance is then the sum of<br/>all these exponentials. Since the Plomp-Levelt curves are smooth,<br/>and since the derivative of a sum of smooth curves is smooth, the<br/>derivative is always well defined. In the adaptive tuning, I do a<br/>(stochastic) gradient minimization of this function.</p><p>In principle, each note can have its own spectrum, but in the<br/>implementation,<br/>I assume that all notes on a given MIDI channel have the same spectrum,<br/>which I must prespecify.</p><p>The model itself is described in detail in<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/consonance.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/consonance.pdf</a><br/>while the algorithm is at:<br/><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun.pdf</a></p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=50073 href="#50073">ðŸ”—</a>gwsmith@svpal.org</h3><span>12/17/2003 7:19:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, sethares@e... wrote:</p><p>&gt; The model itself is described in detail in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/consonance.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/consonance.pdf</a><br/>&gt; while the algorithm is at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun.pdf</a></p><p>I downloaded that, and from the bibliography of adaptun2002 I got the<br/>idea that downloading and unzipping <a href="http://adaptun.zip">adaptun.zip</a> would be of benefit,<br/>so I did that also.
