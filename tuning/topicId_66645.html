Look and see if you can find Preferences or<br/>Options or Network settings and under that something about Proxy Servers.<br/>You want to find settings concerning a proxy server for &quot;HTTP&quot; with a place<br/>that lets you type an IP address.  Type an IP address you find in the<br/>proxy4free table, for example, and try it.  It may require a little patience<br/>to find one that works.  You&apos;re going to have to type the proxy IP address,<br/>click &quot;OK&quot; (or &quot;Apply&quot; or whatever) and try the result.  When you are done<br/>you will probably want to switch back (turn &quot;off&quot; the HTTP proxy, perhaps by<br/>unchecking a box) or performance or reliability is likely to suffer for<br/>normal use.  It is possible you might have to quit your browser each time<br/>for the proxy change to take effect, but first try without doing this.</p><p>It might be considerably easier to use <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com">babelfish.altavista.com</a> instead<br/>because this works rather like a proxy but in a single window, without<br/>actually requiring you to go somewhere else to change proxy settings which<br/>then affects how the browser or perhaps how your whole computer accesses the<br/>web.  But with babelfish you have to specify translation languages, which<br/>might get in the way if you really don&apos;t want translation, or if the<br/>language used is not available in the limited babelfish list.  Still it<br/>might work to specify a false choice of languages, and Babelfish will always<br/>simply fail to translate things that it can&apos;t find in it&apos;s dictionaries for<br/>the source language, which might give you the result you need.</p><p>I suggest trying Babelfish first.  Only problem would be if altavista caved<br/>in to political requirements of your country.  Google has for example done<br/>such things.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div>
