To my knowledge, ASCAP<br/>has not yet asked composers to pay their own license fees.  I have<br/>never heard of such a thing.  Many composers might drop out of the<br/>societies if that were the case... but that&apos;s here in America, and I<br/>know the revenues generated by GEMA for European-based composers are<br/>MUCH higher, so it would be a real detriment to drop out of a society<br/>there!</p><p>Perhaps ASCAP will begin that practice, but, so far, they exist to<br/>GENERATE licensing revenues for composers, not collect composer<br/>payments....  We&apos;ll see...</p><p>P.S. I wasn&apos;t aware that you had any original works on this Yahoo<br/>site, anyway.  If so, I&apos;ve missed them.  I&apos;ve very much enjoyed the<br/>work I have heard so far...  (string quartet)...<br/>_____ ___ ____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=18374 href="#18374">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/5/2001 7:17:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18371.html#18373">/tuning/topicId_18371.html#18373</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joseph Pehrson:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; GEMA _does_ bill composers for work posted on their own web<br/>sites,<br/>&gt; &gt; and it is their intention to come to license agreements with all<br/>&gt; &gt; major content providers.

And then, YAHOO will be paying the license fee, not<br/>you...  Correct?</p><p>As far as individual websites are concerned, they are not &quot;major<br/>content providers&quot; are they??  For example, did GEMA find and bill<br/>you for your own small, private website??  I would be surprised...<br/>(But, I&apos;ve been surprised before...)</p><p>______ ____ _____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
