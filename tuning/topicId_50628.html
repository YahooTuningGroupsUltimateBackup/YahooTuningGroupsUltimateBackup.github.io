In other words, we&apos;re<br/>looking at the &apos;commas&apos; of 5-limit music.</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Paul/com5monz.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Paul/com5monz.gif</a></p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Paul/com5rat.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/Paul/com5rat.gif</a></p><p>The cyan lines with green numbers show the number of cents that each<br/>interval, when played in JI, measures. The horizontal position of an<br/>interval on this graph shows its &quot;taxicab distance in the Tenney<br/>lattice&quot; -- or just as well, the number of digits in the interval&apos;s<br/>ratio. The vertical position of an interval in this graph shows the<br/>typical error you would expect in the prime intervals as a result of<br/>tempering the interval out. Herman has explored many such<br/>temperaments in his music and on his webpages.</p><p>The first graph shows the intervals in lattice-vector notation --<br/>that is, each interval has a frequency ratio of 2^e2 * 3^e3 * 5^e5<br/>and is represented as [e2 e3 e5] on the graph. Intervals so notated<br/>have been named (by Gene, I believe) monzos in honor of our friend<br/>Joe Monzo who likes such notation, and in this guise the word monzo<br/>makes frequent appearances on the tuning-math list (even if Joe Monzo<br/>doesn&apos;t :) ).</p><p>The second graph shows the interval ratios as fractions. This seems<br/>to be a favored notation of Kraig Grady, who prefers it over the<br/>monzo notation. Therefore it would be equally logical to call these<br/>gradys -- with due respect to the fact that Kraig doesn&apos;t tend to<br/>operate in such a &apos;limiting&apos; scenario.</p><p>Both should be of particular interest to Herman Miller.</p><p>The further to the right an interval is on these graphs, the more<br/>complex the temperament is. Clearly the temperaments of the most<br/>interest will be the least complex ones for a given level of error of<br/>the prime intervals, or those which give the lowest error for a given<br/>level of complexity. On the graphs, at least if you consider it<br/>unreasonable to temper out intervals as large or simple as the major<br/>whole tone and minor whole tone, there are 13 commas which look most<br/>useful to temper out in order to derive easily manageable two-<br/>dimensional pitch systems (such as the familiar meantone) from the<br/>three-dimensional 5-limit JI lattice. Note that I don&apos;t assume octave-<br/>equivalence in any of this so far.</p><p>Here is a table showing some properties of these 13 commas &amp;<br/>temperaments -- the &apos;period&apos; column does assume octave-equivalence,<br/>and the &apos;generator&apos; column assumes &apos;period-equivalence&apos; -- ordered<br/>from &apos;coarse&apos; to &apos;fine&apos;:</p><p>lowest complexity, highest error -- these imply extremely simple<br/>scales and require specially designed electronic timbres to<br/>sound &apos;consonant&apos;:<br/>Grady.....Monzo...Temperament...Notes/Octave..Period....Generator<br/>27/25....[0 3 2]....&quot;beep&quot;........4,5,9.......1 oct....~268 cent<br/>16/15....[4 -1 -1]..&quot;father&quot;......3,5,8.......1 oct....~442 cent<br/>25/24....[-3 -1 2]..&quot;dicot&quot;......3,5,7,10.....1 oct....~351 cent</p><p>low complexity, high error -- these imply scales of ordinary<br/>complexity and typically require specially designed electronic<br/>timbres to sound &apos;just&apos; with the possible exception of meantone:<br/>Grady.....Monzo...Temperament...Notes/Octave..Period...Generator<br/>135/128..[-7 3 1]..&quot;pelogic&quot;....7,9,16,23.....1 oct....~523 cent<br/>256/243..[8 5 0]..&quot;Blackwood&quot;...5,10,15,25....1/5 oct...~85 cent<br/>648/625..[3 4 -4]..diminished..4,8,12,16,28...1/4 oct...~94 cent<br/>250/243..[1 -5 3]..porcupine..7,8,15,22,29....1 oct....~163 cent<br/>128/125..[7 0 3]...augmented.3,9,12,15,18,27..1/3 oct...~91 cent<br/>81/80....[-4 4 1]..meantone..5,7,12,19,26,31..1 oct....~504 cent</p><p>medium complexity, medium error -- these imply slightly more complex<br/>scales; a reasonably &apos;just&apos; sound is generally a bit easier to come<br/>by:<br/>Grady.....Monzo....Temperament..Notes/Octave......Period..Generator<br/>3125/3072.[-10 -1 5].&quot;magic&quot;.3,16,19,22,25,53,41..1 oct...~380 cent<br/>2048/2025.[11 -4 -2].diaschismic.10,12,22,34,46...1/2 oct..~105 cent</p><p>high complexity, low error -- still more complex scales; sound is<br/>quite close to &apos;just&apos; with any harmonic timbre:<br/>Grady.......Monzo..Temperament........Notes/Octave....Period.Generator<br/>15625/15552.[-6 -5 6].kleismic/Hanson.15,19,23,34,53..1 oct.~317 cent</p><p>highest complexity, lowest error -- most complex scales; sound is<br/>generally indistinguishable from &apos;just&apos; with any harmonic timbre:<br/>Grady.......Monzo.....Temperament..Notes/Octave...Period.Generator<br/>32805/32768.[-15 8 1].schismic*..12,29,41,53,65...1 oct...~498.3 cent</p><p>*also known as Helmholtz or Groven, and used on Eduardo Sabat-<br/>Garibaldi&apos;s 53-note-per-octave guitars (&quot;Dinarras&quot;)</p></div><h3><a id=50907 href="#50907">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2004 9:52:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 30 Dec 2003 13:32:02 -0000, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;The cyan lines with green numbers show the number of cents that each<br/>&gt;interval, when played in JI, measures.

I&apos;ve had some &quot;interesting&quot; results with Orwell, although<br/>that was<br/>&gt; a long time ago, and it takes some time to feel your way around an<br/>&gt; unfamiliar tuning.</p><p>Herman, I need to clarify something.</p><p>[-21 3 7] = 2109375/2097152 is a comma (actually, it&apos;s called<br/>the &apos;semicomma&apos;, due to Fokker).</p><p>&apos;Orwell&apos;, on the other hand, is Gene&apos;s term for any &apos;linear<br/>temperament&apos; with a generator of about 19/84 octave and a period of 1<br/>octave. Gene usually thinks of it in terms of higher limits than 5.</p><p>If you temper the semicomma out from the 5-limit lattice, you indeed<br/>get a linear temperament that fits the &apos;Orwell&apos; description. However,<br/>if you temper it out from the 7-limit lattice, you get a &apos;planar<br/>temperament&apos;; temper it out from the 11-limit lattice, a &apos;spacial<br/>temperament&apos;. In these cases, the information on my charts remains<br/>valid.</p><p>However, in order to get 7-limit Orwell, which is a &apos;linear<br/>temperament&apos;, you need to temper out an additional comma from the 7-<br/>limit lattice. Alternatively, you could start over and use the two<br/>commas 225/224 and 1728/1715. Since these are a lot simpler than<br/>2109375/2097152, it&apos;s a pretty good guess that you&apos;re dealing with a<br/>simpler temperament here. To get 11-limit Orwell, you need to temper<br/>out three commas -- you could use two of the above and one more, or<br/>you could use 99/98, 121/120, and 176/175. Note that these are all<br/>very simple, and all superparticular (thus being the smallest size<br/>possible for their complexity)!</p><p>I foresaw this confusion which is why, on the big list of commas<br/>and &apos;linear temperaments&apos; on Monz&apos;s ET page, you&apos;ll see that the<br/>entry for orwell actually says &quot;orwell (5-limit)&quot;.</p><p>For a different sort of example, note the appearance of [-19 12 0] =<br/>531441/524288 on my charts. This is the famous Pythagorean comma.<br/>Tempering it out is usually associated with 12-equal -- in fact, in<br/>my Top scheme, it leads to an equal division of a 1200.61705-cent<br/>octave into 12 equal parts, or 12ED2.00071297. But as is well known,<br/>the 5-limit errors of 12-equal are much larger than the 5-limit<br/>errors of meantone, and yet on the graph, the Pythagorean comma is<br/>lower, meaning it has lower errors, than the syntonic comma. Why?<br/>Because tempering out the Pythagorean comma from the *5-limit*<br/>lattice does not lead to 12-equal, instead it leads to an infinite<br/>number of parallel 12-equal systems at a ratio of 5:1 apart from one<br/>another (the Pythagorean comma doesn&apos;t touch the 5-axis, as you can<br/>see from the third entry in its monzo being 0). This is a &apos;linear<br/>temperament&apos; with a period of about 100 cents and a generator of<br/>about 15 cents; it was the subject of my second or third post ever to<br/>the tuning list in 1996; and we now call it &apos;aristoxenean&apos;. A true 5-<br/>limit use of 12-equal involves tempering out *two* commas, not one,<br/>and so can&apos;t be evaluated from my charts. My charts *will* read<br/>correctly whether you are considering the effect of tempering out the<br/>Pythagorean comma in the 3-limit, 5-limit, or any higher limit -- as<br/>long as you aren&apos;t employing a hidden assumption about other commas<br/>being tempered out.</p></div><h3><a id=50983 href="#50983">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2004 10:21:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, 03 Jan 2004 22:58:06 -0000, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;I see things somewhat differently.

See the tuning-math list. If I&apos;m right,<br/>&gt;it seems that meantone should be realized with octaves of 1201.6985<br/>&gt;cents, fifths of 697.5644 cents, hence fourths of 504.1341 cents,<br/>&gt;major sixths of 890.9947 cents, major thirds of 386.8606 cents, minor<br/>&gt;thirds of 310.7038 cents, minor sixths of 814.8379 cents, as well as<br/>&gt;major ninths of 1395.1288 cents, etc . . .</p><p>Sounds good to me.</p><p>&gt;&gt; W&uuml;rschmidt temperament also stands out, but it&apos;s one that although<br/>&gt;it looks<br/>&gt;&gt; good mathematically, I haven&apos;t found it to be as useful as it might<br/>&gt;seem to<br/>&gt;&gt; be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Less useful that 5-limit orwell?</p><p>Orwell has a useful 9-note MOS for melodic purposes, and it seems to work<br/>well with extended tertian harmonies from what I recall (although I haven&apos;t<br/>spent much time with either one).</p><p>&gt;&gt; So there are other factors involved, but at first glance, something<br/>&gt;as<br/>&gt;&gt; simple as the size of a comma in cents seems to be a pretty good<br/>&gt;guide to<br/>&gt;&gt; whether it might be of interest.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How about the size of the font I used? Is that a better guide? The<br/>&gt;font size was a monotonic function of log(n-d)/log(n*d), where n/d is<br/>&gt;the ratio of the comma.</p><p>It looks pretty good until you get to the far left hand side of the chart,<br/>where commas like [-1 1 0] and [2 -1 0], and [-2 0 1] show up as huge<br/>(would anyone actually temper these out?)

I<br/>never noticed this resemblance until just now, but it makes sense; it&apos;s one<br/>of the more reasonable things you can do with 13-ET. Considering that his<br/>etudes were written back in 1979-1980 (almost a quarter century ago!), this<br/>seems pretty sophisticated to me.

To the unweighted Tenney lattice add a time dimension.<br/>For a given prime limit, mark the points with ratios written<br/>in / slash notation and the rungs with ratios written in : colon<br/>notation.  In plain temperament, these ratios must be replaced<br/>with irrational numbers at T_0, and they remain unchanged at<br/>T_x for any x.  In &quot;adaptive JI&quot; the slash ratios must be replaced<br/>at T_(&gt;0) but colon ratios at T_x (but not those between T_(x-1)<br/>and T_x) remain.  In the system I mention above, at least one<br/>colon ratio between T_(x-1) and T_x can remain.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
