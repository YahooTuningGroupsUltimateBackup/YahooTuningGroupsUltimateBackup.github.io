Some instruments have only two<br/>notes, like the marimba eroica (correct me if I am wrong).</p><p>HP&apos;s music is about a set of guiding principles, and though they can be<br/>used separately, HP saw them as being an artistic unit.</p><p>The scale is unimportant, in my opinion. Instead composers using JI in HP&apos;s<br/>context should perhaps think in terms of a selection of ratios, and devise<br/>resources that &apos;work through&apos; them; again this is my opinion.</p><p>Mark</p></div>
