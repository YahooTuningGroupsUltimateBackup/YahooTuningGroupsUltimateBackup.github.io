I will make this brief as I am just beginning my independent journey with music theory and microtonality (been on list since January). Needless to say much is still over my head at the time (as it should be). I have been a guitarist for 17 years and a DJ (techno; the real genre) for almost 3 now. I did have 10 years of guitar lessons (age 6 to 16), however it was mediated by your average guitar teacher (IE what song do you want to learn this week?; rather than theory/application). I have been following popular electronic music from more dance related and industrial/experimental/IDM areas since &apos;94 to microsound in the last year .</p><p>I have been online and programming (started with C) back in &apos;92 and am currently finishing my computer science undergrad at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Needless to say, I am a little disappointed with my college experience, but such is life (with State run institutions!). I have taken most of the last year off from college to pursue music and producing (check out my studio gear at <a href="http://www.egregious.net/~catharsis/equipment.html">http://www.egregious.net/~catharsis/equipment.html</a>) I own a Cerwin Vega Intense sound system with a friend and have run/promoted/DJed over 80 events in the San Luis Obispo area (central coast of California). Most recently a weekly club night focusing on electronic dance music (<a href="http://badmonkey.egregious.net">badmonkey.egregious.net</a>). I do hope this list will take this pursuit seriously as there is musical relevance in something so visceral as dance music. IE. in terms of DJing (like anything else) it is what you put into it.</p><p>I have applied for a summer intensive session for computer music at CCMix (<a href="http://www.upic.asso.fr/">http://www.upic.asso.fr/</a>). If I am to go onto graduate studies it will be for computer music, but up to now my academic experience has been less that satisfactory so I might just go about all of this independently.</p><p>Anyway, I will be lurking on this list as I find a lot of the discussion interesting. I believe I have a really good breadth view of music at the time and soon will start plunging into particular areas for more depth. Obviously, I would like to communicate in person as there really is not anyone in my area that I am aware of working with anything microtonal and I don&apos;t see &quot;eye to eye&quot; with the Cal Poly music department; IE far too liberal arts and conservative. Luckily I have an acquaintance who is a student at Harvey Mudd, so I will be coming to the Microfest this weekend as I have a place to stay. It also helps that the conference is free otherwise I could not attend! I am young; I do have a &quot;radical haircut&quot;, so there will be no doubt who I am (IE look for the multicolored mohawk). Don&apos;t be afraid to say hello! I keep my hair the way I do for fun and it is great in a town like San Luis Obispo where 95% of the students fit the frat/sorority mold. =:)</p><p>--Mike (Catharsis)</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

The<br/>only academic help I would seek would be to reach a level of mathematical proficiency that allows<br/>me to follow the more technical discussions on this list and the concepts that arise from the<br/>study of the numerous links that branch off from this study. Then I will be able to offer my own<br/>theories and participate fully in discussions. I also think that it would be of great benefit to<br/>know the subject inside out if, like me, you intend composing and performing a lot in JI or non-12<br/>systems. Good music will speak for itself but if you want funding and co-operation from the<br/>&apos;establishment&apos; to help with performances it helps to be on top of the subject. Hence my<br/>particular need for a brush up in mathematics which in my opinion is the language most used to<br/>dicuss the intricacies of JI/microtonal music.</p><p>In the UK it is definitely not in the interest of University music departments to offer courses<br/>that don&apos;t feed into the commercial sector, in the case of music, the conventional &apos;classical&apos;<br/>industry. In Scotland there are only two of our fine original historical universities which still<br/>have music departments, the rest closed down under Thatcher&apos;s ethical onslaught. Of the two that<br/>exist, one that I know well wouldn&apos;t know a microtone from the hole in its ****,  so to speak.<br/>&apos;Distinguished&apos; composers and academics can be terrified that they don&apos;t know it all so they<br/>ignore it.</p><p>I&apos;ve opted for the Open University, an excellent UK based open learning establishment with local<br/>tutors that offers modular degree courses in all subjects. I&apos;m going back to the formal study of<br/>mathematics next January.</p><p>If you want to compose microtonally then it can be of benefit to study Western music and the<br/>techniques used by the best composers. But it&apos;s a long haul and seems a roundabout way of getting<br/>a handle on microtonality. I think a resourceful individual can learn the essential stuff of music<br/>without the help of a University.</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2001 6:26:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Hello Alison,</p><p>&gt;&gt; I suggest that you are better to rely on your own resources in the<br/>study of microtonality. &gt;&gt;</p><p>How very true!

If<br/>you understand logarithms, you should pretty<br/>much know all the math you need to for<br/>microtonality. Of course, it&apos;s fun to get into<br/>the nitty-gritty with more advanced math --<br/>on this list, I&apos;ve helped Joe Monzo with the<br/>calculus that Woolhouse used to derive the<br/>optimal meantone temperament, Pierre<br/>Lamothe has made reference to group theory,<br/>we&apos;ve brought up the Ferguson-Forcade<br/>algorithm; I started a new list based on a<br/>concept learned in an information theory<br/>class. . . But really, all the important<br/>microtonal concepts and results should be<br/>understandable to a bright high school senior,<br/>or even freshman -- a microtonalist who uses<br/>more advanced math will typically be able to<br/>explain it to you on the spot, without<br/>requiring you to go through a math course to<br/>learn it first.</p><p>I urge Stan and anyone else who has trouble<br/>following the math on this list to do two<br/>things: search the list archives for earlier<br/>discussion of the topic in question; and feel<br/>free to post questions in response to any post<br/>that puzzles you.</p><p>Please be aware, you&apos;ll find that there are<br/>extremely conflicting views on how to use<br/>math in microtonality, beyond the most<br/>pedestrian calculations. For example, some<br/>(like Pierre Lamothe) feel that pitch heights<br/>should correspond to simple ratios; others<br/>(like myself) subscribe instead to the view<br/>that intervals should correspond as closely as<br/>possible to simple ratios; others (like Stephen<br/>Soderberg) don&apos;t care about ratios at all and<br/>are interested instead in the &quot;set theory&quot; math<br/>of pitch classes (this is not related to the &quot;set<br/>theory&quot; you&apos;d find offered in a mathematics<br/>department; it relates instead to the numerics<br/>of musicians like Forte and Babbitt). We&apos;ll<br/>probably debate these things endlessly (if<br/>given the opportunity) -- you should come to<br/>your own conclusions based on some serious<br/>and honest listening on your own (and of<br/>course a means of producing microtonal<br/>musical examples).</p><p>Finally, I don&apos;t want to discourage anyone<br/>from pursuing advanced mathematics _not_<br/>suggested by a musical problem and then<br/>finding ways of applying it to music. In the<br/>past I&apos;ve expressed the opinion that this is<br/>&quot;silly&quot;, that math should only be used when a<br/>specific musical problem needs to be solved,<br/>and that the music must always be the end<br/>and math can only be the means. But if<br/>someone chooses to use a purely<br/>mathematical creation as the source for a<br/>musical composition, so be it -- it is certainly<br/>a valid act of creativity, and it might even<br/>sound like good music (though I&apos;ve yet to<br/>hear an example of that)!</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/8/2001 12:19:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>I just wanted to say that this was the most sensible and clear<br/>descriptions of the mathematical necessities and varieties that come<br/>into play on the list -- very well put!</p><p>I&apos;ve threatened time and time to do &apos;it&apos;, but I&apos;ve always lacked that<br/>one ingrediant: time!

After high school algebra and geometry, that was it.</p><p>Only when learning microtonal intervals (intervals other than those produced<br/>by 12-tET) that something developed in me with numbers.  Since a 5/4 (at 386<br/>cents) is only that, my emotional memory kicked in to designate the accurate<br/>number place for the interval.  And so on.</p><p>People that I meet seem so sure of themselves that I miss me a math wizard<br/>(like so many on this list).  It is not true.

Learn all of a system so that<br/>you can hear it, and then switch systems.  Soon you will have transversed the<br/>once tabula rasa with every little interval producible.  (I did 24-tET, then<br/>31-tET, then JI which could based on any distinct fundamental, 19-tET, and<br/>then Pythagorean, and many others).  The eventually fall in on each other<br/>with shared information.  Concepts like meantone and well-tempered makes most<br/>sense within  a cultural context.</p><p>Ultimately, all intervals made sensible to the mind and heart, are expressed<br/>by numbers....but not by any means high mathematics.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/9/2001 1:16:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Catharsis &lt;catharsis@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ...
