There the idea is an extention of the siren. Normal sirens<br/>basically work  by sending a thin stream of air through holes in a spinning<br/>disk. The holes are normally arranged in concentric rings. The greater the<br/>number of  holes in a ring and the faster the disk spins the resultant tone will<br/>be higher in pitch. You can have lots of pipes sending streams of air<br/>simaltaneously to different rings. You can play chords this way. The tuning of<br/>the chords will depend on the ratios between the numbers of holes in the rings,<br/>obviously just tunings are very easy to construct, tempered chords would be a<br/>little more challenging [and possibly pointless on such a simple instrument as a<br/>siren].<br/>Jaques Dudon&apos;s photosonique disks use clear perspex disks upon which he has<br/>screen printed in black mandala    like designs. I believe the spinning of the<br/>dsks is motor controlled. behind the disks he has photovoltaic [solar] cells. He<br/>shines the light torch through the spinning disk [or disks he can use many at<br/>one creating beautiful intereference patterns] on the solar cells. The signal<br/>from the cells is amplified and listened to.</p><p>The photosonique disks of Dudon create a similar effect to that you mention [i.e<br/>seeing colour spectrums]</p><p>The sound ?<br/>C&apos;est fantastique !</p><p>&lt;A Galaxcy in a teacup.</p><p>A long time ago, I was reading through a book that my mother gave me, and<br/>altho it is back far, far away in the deep recesses of my mind, I have<br/>thought of something that this post on synasthesia brought back to me....</p><p>The book itself is called BOILING WATER IN A PAPER CUP, and it had in it a<br/>funny little do-it-your-self project that had the reader design the most<br/>interesting of optical illusions, which consisted of a half white, and half<br/>black paper disk.</p><p>There was a further addition to the design of this disk, was that on the<br/>white side of this disk were segments, and these segments had concentric<br/>rings painted on them, concentric rings painted at various distances from<br/>the center.</p><p>Each segment has a set of concentric rings at greater and greater distances.....</p><p>All of this was pretty novel, but the main point of this illusion was that<br/>you&apos;d spin the disk, and the illusion was created in that you&apos;d see colors.</p><p>Colors became most aparent when the disk slowed down, and it was some<br/>phenomonon that tricked the color receptors in the mind&apos;s eye into thinikg<br/>that they were perceiveing colors...</p><p>I would draw ASCII diagrams to show you this, but I cannot manage circles.</p><p>Could a sonic equivalent be created?</p><p>I gave this some thought, and I feel that it would be imaginitave to draw<br/>ASCII diagrams after all:</p><p>                 ---------------------------<br/>                /                           \<br/>               /                             \<br/>              /     --------                  \<br/>             /      --------                   \<br/>            /       ---------------             \<br/>           /   ////         -------              \<br/>          /   ////          -------\\\\           \<br/>         /   ////                   \\\\           \<br/>        /////                        \\\\           \<br/>       /////                     |||||               \<br/>      /////                      |||||                \<br/>      .---------------------0-------------------------.<br/>      \----------------------------------------------/<br/>       \--------------------------------------------/<br/>        \------------------------------------------/<br/>         \----------------------------------------/<br/>          \--------------------------------------/<br/>           \------------------------------------/<br/>            \----------------------------------/<br/>             \--------------------------------/<br/>              \------------------------------/<br/>               -----------------------------</p><p>Please let me know if this hexagonal ASCII diagram gets through to you allright.</p><p>It is ment to represent a circular disk, with concentric black rings, and a<br/>black bottom half.</p><p>You can make this out of card board, and black biro.</p><p>be sure to get the balck JET black,a dn the white DAZZELING white.</p><p>If you spin this on an electric moror, or a kictchen wizz, you will see<br/>color bands appear as this disk slows down by looking at it from 30cm, or<br/>approximately 11.81 inches.</p><p>The outer bands, if memory erves me correctly will appear red, being the<br/>slower of wavelengths, and the inner ones will appear violet.</p><p>Yet another variant I can think of on this is one in negative colors, that<br/>is where black=white, and where white=black, or even a four state one, using<br/>quarters where:</p><p>A    B</p><p>C    D</p><p>A=Negative rings, B=White surface, C=Postivie rings, D=Jet black surface.</p><p>I may wounder what the sonic equivalent of this might be???</p><p>I assumme that it MIGHT involve the alternation of white noise, and silence<br/>(the sonic equivalent of WHITE and BLACK), and with the white noise having<br/>various frequencys filtered out COMPLETELY.</p><p>The alternation of these white//black noise parte could begin really, REALLY<br/>quickly, and then slow down.</p><p>Rather than list all of these possibilitys, I would like to see what the<br/>tuning members come up with in ways of experiments, and self-done<br/>home-science-amature projects, and I will compare ideas with you&apos;all.</p><p>Any thoughts on the matter?</p><p>---Sarn.&gt;</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p></div>
