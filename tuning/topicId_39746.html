You know, as pointed out by many authors such as Guy Murchie in Music of<br/>the Spheres, that there are &quot;Natural&quot; shapes in Nature: six-sided hexagonal gems like<br/>emeralds and eight-sided pyramidal gems like diamonds.

For explanations of LucyTuning (and related materials, with Galaxy-wide Copyrights or whatever) you should ask Mr. Lucy himself. They are his theories.</p><p>2. The term &quot;natural&quot;, in all uses but especially (for us) in music, is layered with many meanings. I *think* I know what you are asking, but using the term &quot;natural&quot; will lead you into a *lot* of confusion.</p><p>I will defer to the many more knowledgeable people on the tuning list, but I&apos;ll try to at least point you in the right direction.</p><p>&gt; I thank you for your suggestion that I read an elementary book.<br/>&gt; However, I am not after an elementary understanding.</p><p>I am not meaning for you to have _only_ an elementary understanding, but if you are confused over the most basic elements of Western music, and then going out from there, you will need to instruct yourself in those basics. I, myself, may one day want to understand, deeply, quantum physics. If so, I better learn the mathematical and physical tenets and basics of those disciplines (or other suitable ones) before simply casting myself in the deep end.</p><p>&gt; I guess what I am after now: can you explain to me if there IS<br/>&gt; such a thing as &quot;Natural&quot; scales?  And &quot;Natural&quot; chords?</p><p>I am going to stop you right there and give what I *think* is what you are after: I _believe_ you are looking to the natural frequency vibrations of the harmonic series, sometimes (frequently) referred to as the harmonic series. These are the frequencies that start with a root, produce an octave above that, then the perfect fifth, another octave, a major third, etc. These frequencies vibrate in a relationship to each other: 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, etc.</p><p>Again, there are physio-acoustic wizards here on the list (Paul Erlich, to name one) who can explain this not only more correctly and exactly but also with proper terminology.</p><p>That said, there is one branch of music/tuning that is a direct outgrowth of the natural harmonic series. This one large branch is known as Just Intonation, and it is practiced - by composers and performers - in a number of different ways. An introduction to this subject (indeed, the first chapter from the &quot;Just Intonation Primer&quot;,  by David Doty) can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/primer2.html">http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/primer2.html</a></p><p>&gt; You know, as pointed out by many authors such as Guy Murchie in<br/>&gt; Music of the Spheres, that there are &quot;Natural&quot; shapes in Nature:<br/>&gt; six-sided hexagonal gems like emeralds and eight-sided pyramidal<br/>&gt; gems like diamonds.

Although some in both groups want me to send<br/>to only ONE group, I have yet to figure out why.  I<br/>have gotten answers from both groups.  The DELETE button<br/>is on my computer and gets used on messages that do not<br/>speak to me.  But some insist on emailing me off-list<br/>and asking me to cease.  OK: I get the message.</p><p>To ALL: if my sig file is clicked, it can be seen that<br/>I was a professor of world literature classics over three<br/>decades, among other unrelated odd jobs, including<br/>being a motion picture projectionist for 23 years, mostly<br/>summers.  I have not been idle, as apparently have none<br/>of you.  I am also an author, and am working on another<br/>book, ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  It might be also<br/>subtitled Music of the Spheres.  I am not sure yet.  Time<br/>will tell.</p><p>Two decades ago, I published<br/>a couple science papers on the broad topics: MUSIC OF THE SPHERES,<br/>BODE&apos;S LAW EXPLAINED,<br/>ON THE SPECIAL THEORY OF ORDER [in contradistiction to Einstein&apos;s<br/>&quot;relativity theory&quot;: I consider his theory a statistical theory<br/>within the larger GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  I do not wish to go<br/>into details, on these music theory lists, which may surprise and<br/>also please some.]  A few members and I have an off-list correspondence.<br/>I hope to have my papers online for those so interested, as someone<br/>who you all know has them now.  I believe the content will interest<br/>musicologists with theoretic minds.</p><p>After my initial papers two decades ago, Guy Murchie called me, and<br/>asked to write a paper about me for The Old Farmer&apos;s Almanac.  As a<br/>prerequisite, he invited me to his house in New Hampshire to conduct<br/>a symposium on the subject.  To my surprise, when I got there, there<br/>were two dozen mathematicians, scientists, mostly astrophysicists,<br/>physicists, and musicologists.  Murchie was a Harvardian, which was<br/>right down the road in Boston.  I was stunned to lecture to those pure<br/>science minds, as I was a THEORIST, but it went well, and the rest<br/>is history.  At this point: I am working on a last paper entitled<br/>ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ORDER.  That is the reason for my questions<br/>to trained musicologists.  I apologize to those who found me a distraction,<br/>or boring, or whatever.  Unbeknownst to all, a few have emailed me off-list,<br/>and some have become communicators and others wished to take me to task.<br/>It makes sense to me that members should answer questions if they wish,<br/>rather than lecture members and create ad hominems which only tend to<br/>shut down communication.</p><p>I wish to thank Pauline, Joe S and Joe M.  I am not disappearing,<br/>but I am to become a lurker.  I have NOT gotten ALL my answers from you all,<br/>but you all have been for the most part kind and gracious, and I thank<br/>you.  To those who were annoyed, so be it.  I did not mean to be that,<br/>figuring musicologists were interested in music theory.  I guess I was<br/>wrong.  If I was not, those who care need to speak up.  Otherwise, I will<br/>lurk.</p><p>As said above: I KNEW Guy Murchie, have devoured his book<br/>MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.  Please understand, I have a vast library, and<br/>have read many many many many many many many books on the subjects I<br/>am putting forth.  If you wonder why 7 manys, you might enjoy<br/>Hemingway&apos;s HILLS LIKE WHITE ELEPHANTS</p><p>I know Pythagoras, et al., as anyone<br/>who has read my papers will know.   I have read more books than<br/>I care to delineate.</p><p>As I stated in my papers<br/>ALL sciences are based on MATHEMATICS.  Anyone who does not<br/>agree with me on that is in DISAGREEMENT with me.  So be it.<br/>As I said in my BODE&apos;S LAW EXPLAINED paper, and what impressed<br/>Murchie was just THAT.  I argued that MATH is the basis of<br/>MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.  It take PHYSICS to EXPLAIN the relationships<br/>of the ENTITIES observed by their mathematical trails, regardless<br/>of the DISCIPLINE.  I believe the (a) MATH and (b) PHYSICS relationship<br/>as I stated in this paragraph, implicitly.</p><p>Because you all have ADVANCED TUNING and TUNING-MATH beyond that<br/>of Murchie and others of two decades ago, things have changed.<br/>I had hoped that some of you could assist me.  In fact, I did<br/>open up a few discussions which Pauline and others added to re:<br/>Organs.  But it was a MEMBER who asked me NOT to take my thoughts<br/>off list.</p><p>Now, I am NOT so sure.  No, I do not have all my answers, and will<br/>lurk and at some point ask a question, down the road, and answer those<br/>who query me about my ideas re: Music of the Spheres.</p><p>It is the minds of musicologists which can assist the topic.  Do not<br/>forget that Pythagoras, et al., developed these theses millenniums ago,<br/>and it can take another couple millenniums to resolve the questions.<br/>For those NOT interest in the subject, I apologize for bring it up.</p><p>In conclusion: if someone KNOWS of a message board which WELCOMES a<br/>discussion of MUSIC OF THE SPHERES and the MATH and PHYSICS thereof,<br/>let me know.  I will take my question THERE.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Y!

But I think those interested in tuning have the cart before the horse<br/>(music rack before the music) when they use math to create an arbitarary just<br/>scale, then write music to fit it. My approach as a trained musician<br/>(organist, composer, arranger, transcriber) was to take music that had<br/>already been composed for tempered scales and determine what theoretical just<br/>scale would permit one to accurately play such music. And new music as well.</p><p>And I found the answer--a scale based on the harmonic-partials spectrum<br/>rather than arbitararily chosen just intervals. As the notes in a chord need<br/>to be in agreement with their counterparts in the harmonic spectrum. Just as<br/>organ mutation stops with fractional footages need to be tuned to jsut<br/>intonation. And thus why ET isn&apos;t the best tuning for organs. The result was<br/>the 0 #/b 19-limit (in C) Phillips Just Scale I posted here.</p><p>Once the best theoretical just scale was determined, it had to be made<br/>practical. As it has more notes per octave in the wrong places than a<br/>practical keyboard will permit. A practical keyboard simply cannot have a #<br/>and b at the same digital location. As one interval will be smaller in reach<br/>than normaal, and the other larger. Such not only creates awkwardness, but<br/>prohibits the player from playing without looking at the keys. As any<br/>proffessional musican is supposed to be able to do. Such digitals were never<br/>popular when used on organs historically.</p><p>A proper scale and keyboard can&apos;t be just for experimenters. They needs to be<br/>useful to trained musicians willing to use them.</p><p>The solution was to slightly temper (- 2 cents) the just 5th in the scale to<br/>the ET 5th. This caused the 7Eb and D# to virtually merge in pitch, and the<br/>7Ab and G# likewise. Tempering the just major 3rds 1-2 cents merged them<br/>completely. But then, since the harmonic minor 7ths are also used as D# and<br/>G# they had to be raised or lowered 1 cent to make a perfect match. The<br/>result was the 0 #/b 19-limit (in C) Phillips Just-Temperament Scale I posted<br/>here. (The 19th limit is Eb--298 cents 19/16. While C doesn&apos;t use it in its<br/>chromatic scale, it does use flatted chords occasionally.)</p><p>A practical just-temperament keyboard has to have split digitals for<br/>rarely-used notes. But they must be in the same general location for a given<br/>diatonic key signature as the regular digitals. Thus, since C uses no #s nor<br/>bs, all the split digitals for that key are white ones. Septimal c and<br/>tertian e, using the same scale and tuning, do use bs and #s, but the regular<br/>black keys are used for them with my tuning and keyboard layout. The same<br/>basic principles apply to all other key signatures commonly used.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.

As I wrote in BODE&apos;S LAW EXPLAINED, they use the a.u., the measure between<br/>Sun-Earth distance as the ruler of the system, and I say that is WRONG, that the<br/>measuring stick should be the Sun-Mercury distance, then all the MEAN data numbers become<br/>a &quot;natural series of numbers&quot; as expressed by Margo, below, about MUSIC and I have<br/>applied the same logic to the SPHERES.

Either is regarded by<br/>Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325) as perfectly concordant, but with the first<br/>form generally preferable.</p><p>This preference, however, may vary: around 1030, Guido d&apos;Arezzo in his<br/>_Micrologus_ prefers the 3:4 fourth to the 2:3 fifth as a basic<br/>interval, and advocates the placement of the fourth below the fifth in<br/>a technique of three-voice singing which involves a series of 3:4:6<br/>sonorities.</p><p>If we want a name for the 3:4:6 reflecting later stylistic trends<br/>around the 13th century, we could call it a &quot;converse trine,&quot; since<br/>the intervals are said to be arranged &quot;conversely&quot; (_e converso_) from<br/>the more conclusive 2:3:4 sonority with the fifth below the fourth.</p><p>A standard Gothic Pythagorean tuning, generally assumed in medieval<br/>European theory (with a few interesting variations), makes both the<br/>2:3:4 and its &quot;conversity&quot; of 3:4:6 pure.</p><p>In neo-medieval music, however, the fifths are often tuned somewhat<br/>wider than pure, and the fourths somewhat narrower, with about 2 cents<br/>of tempering standard.</p><p>It should be noted that in the 18th-19th century styles discussed by<br/>Jon Szanto, a complete 2:3:4 or 3:4:6 trine of medieval or<br/>neo-medieval styles would be considered some kind of incomplete<br/>sonority, for example a portion of a 4:5:6 triad. Similarly, in the<br/>21st-century decatonic harmony of Paul Erlich based on a complete<br/>4:5:6:7 tetrad, the complete 4:5:6 triad of 18th-century music would<br/>be considered an incomplete portion of a tetrad.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@v...<br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>Margo: your message was on tuning but SEEMS in response to tuning-math: but I am glad<br/>it is on tuning.  Margo, I have always seen what you express above as basic to MATH<br/>and I guess it speaks directly to musicologists:  your wrote,<br/>&quot;To me, 3:4:6 is a variation on the more conclusive 2:3:4, with the<br/>latter arrangement (outer 2:4 octave, 2:3 fifth below, 3:4 fourth<br/>above) as a complete stable sonority in 13th-14th century music of<br/>Western Europe.&quot;</p><p>In my quest to understand MUSIC OF THE SPHERES, I observed the MEAN data of the orbitals<br/>of the planets from the center out toward the perimeter as, Sun 0, Mercury 1, Venus 2,<br/>Earth 3, Mars 4, Ceres 8^*, Jupiter 15, Saturn 30, Uranus 60, Neptune 90, and Pluto at<br/>120, or in reverse, from out toward the center, Pluto 4/4, Neptune 3/4, Uranus 1/2,<br/>Saturn 1/4, Jupiter 1/8, Ceres 1/15, Mars 1/30, earth 1/40, Venus 1/60, Mercury 1/120,<br/>and Sun at 0.  It seems to me that your basic statement about Western music describes the<br/>solar-planetary system MEAN oribital data quite well: &quot;As one theorist around 1300<br/>explains, in 2:3:4 the intervals follow a &quot;natural series&quot; of numbers 2-3-4, with the 2:3<br/>fifth &quot;preceding&quot; the more complex 3:4 fourth.&quot;</p><p>^* I explained in my papers, that the solar-planetary system is REAL, and not an<br/>arbitrary structure such as DIFFERENT music systems, and therefore the Ceres orbital<br/>at 8 and the next at 15-16^* are points of discussion.  In attempts to EXPLAIN something<br/>observed in MATH the observers has to seek the IDEAL just as Margo, I think, is pointing<br/>out in her fuller statement.</p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Y!

The classical and medieval art of &quot;music&quot; (in the<br/>quadrivium with arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy) was essentially<br/>the theoretical study of proportions, with the acoustic realisation<br/>of those proportions (on the monochord or canon) a secondary or even<br/>incidental aspect. The proportions could be expressed as well in<br/>architectural forms or in apparent distances between heavenly bodies.<br/>From these origins, the west has had a long tradition of talking<br/>about architecture or celestial mechanics in terms of &quot;harmony&quot;.  The<br/>actual practice of music was never a central subject of this<br/>discipline, although there were isolated attempts to identify<br/>particular configurations with real scales. (A beautiful example of<br/>the use of classical _geometry_, on the other hand, to describe a<br/>musical performance is to be found in Jon Barlow&apos;s _Xemharmonikon_<br/>article on Euclid&apos;s proofs as monochord examples).</p><p>I think that &quot;music&quot;, in this quadrivial sense, remains useful for<br/>talking about the basic _local_ pitch structures in music, both<br/>melodic and harmonic, and is often delightfully useful in discussing<br/>architectural forms or forms found in visual arts.  The application<br/>of whole number of proportions to natural systems, however, is more<br/>problematic. The arrangement of planets around a sun at any given<br/>point in time, for example, is the result of the historical<br/>interaction of masses, distances, gravitation and probably a lot of<br/>accidents along the way.  Classical theorists knew precious little<br/>about this, with their earth-centered and circular models, and we<br/>still don&apos;t know enough.  This is notoriously complex (tried solving<br/>the three-body problem lately?) and all the interest really lies -<br/>for met, at least - in the details. A &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; model,<br/>based upon static, whole number proportions is going to be a gross<br/>simplification of a single moment in a dynamic system -- but how do<br/>you choose the moment?  Pluto&apos;s not always the furthest out.  How do<br/>you express the masses musically?  The masses are as essential as the<br/>distances, aren&apos;t they?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That said, there have been interesting attempts to turn &quot;harmony of<br/>the spheres&quot; models into real music. Laurie Spiegel did a dynamic<br/>version of Kepler, with continuously sliding tones. Another<br/>intersting piece is Charles Dodge&apos;s _Earth&apos;s Magnetic Field_,<br/>directing translating one index of the effect of solar radiation on<br/>the earth&apos;s magnetic field into audible sounds.  In both of these<br/>cases, however, we are not dealing with a actual, sounding, harmony<br/>made by a natural phenomenon but rather with a mapping into a<br/>parallel experience that retains some proportional relationships. I<br/>think that distinction is a subtle one and may often be lost.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=39819 href="#39819">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2002 3:57:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have up on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> music using scales and/or tuning involving Orwell, 171-et, 126/125-planar, 64/63-planar, {3,7}-subgroup 36-et, 72-et, and pure 11-limit JI.

More anon.</p><p>I published Arnold&apos;s Law in 1979, as follows:<br/>however, note I have added the Harmonic C Note [bodies]</p><p>C Notes_____Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal Mean**<br/>Octaves            Or Perimeter<br/>Or Harmonics</p><p>0***________Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>1___________Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles<br/>2___________Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28<br/>?___________Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42<br/>4.09________Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56<br/>8.18________Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>16.4________Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12<br/>32.7________Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24<br/>65.4________Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49<br/>?___________Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74<br/>130.8_______Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99</p><p>*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;</p><p>**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet</p><p>***the NO SOUND point, from which the C Scale originates in the 1 C Note,<br/>expressed at a perimeter of pi [3.14] when it so oscillates and sounds,<br/>audibly to perception, however perceived: [to me, a scale is really a<br/>series of concentric spheres of sound, with each higher note created<br/>by another sphere surrounding the inner spheres in the same way the<br/>Music of the Spheres appears to us, visually and mathematically, with<br/>the planetary orbitals as means of their distances, expressed as spheres.]</p><p>So, Daniel, what do you think about the IDEAL PROPORTIONS discovered in<br/>the MUSIC OF THE SPHERES or spacings of the planets?</p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>Daniel writes:  The application<br/>of whole number of proportions to natural systems, however, is more<br/>problematic. The arrangement of planets around a sun at any given<br/>point in time, for example, is the result of the historical<br/>interaction of masses, distances, gravitation and probably a lot of<br/>accidents along the way.<br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>No doubt, Daniel, in the &quot;relativity&quot; of the system, individual orbitals<br/>the way astronomers look at them are unique.  But I have postulated the<br/>STATISTICAL MEAN or the AVERAGE distance DATA as relevant, over long<br/>periods of time.  Mankind has viewed the planetary data for millennium<br/>and the planets are where predicted.  H.&apos;s Uncertainty Principle argues<br/>that if a scientists seeks the particle, then wave data cannot be determined,<br/>and vice versa.  If the wave data is sought, the particle cannot be<br/>determined.  I covered this in my papers.</p><p>Musicologists KNOW that if only one bar of music is heard, one might not<br/>hear ALL notes.  But if lots and lots and LOTS of music is heard, one<br/>might be able to ascertain ALL notes, yes, there will errant F# notes<br/>that were meant to be F by the score sheet.  But, on average, over many<br/>notes looked at, something could be said about the IDEAL MUSICAL TUNING<br/>of the particular system being analyzed.</p><p>Think of it this way: suppose someone lives in the New York area, and over<br/>a year uses a cell phone and is TRACKED by the police.  One day, or one<br/>orbital will not NECESSARILY show where that person lives, resides, works.<br/>But IF all calls are TRACKED for a year, then a SPHERE of data will show<br/>the ORBITAL RANGE of positions of the CALLER.<br/>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>Daniel writes:<br/>  Classical theorists knew precious little<br/>about this, with their earth-centered and circular models, and we<br/>still don&apos;t know enough.<br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>No, Daniel, I do not agree.  Two decades ago I published my BODE&apos;S LAW<br/>EXPLAINED and it proves that the solar-planetary system DATA over long<br/>periods of time carves out CIRCULAR ORBITALS similar to DIFFRACTION PATTERNS<br/>OF ATOMS.  I made that point then, and reiterate it now.  Those PATTERNS<br/>of the ORBITALS have MEANS just as INTENDED F notes of an orchestra over<br/>a long period of RECORDED time would show a MEAN OF F NOTES.  We all know<br/>what it means [pun intended :)] to SING off-pitch, and for some of us<br/>our ears hurt when notes are thrown too high and dropped too low.  But still,<br/>the PURE IDEAL NOTE SCALE or the SCORE SHEET exists, and can be ascertained;<br/>in other words, the Bach piece EXISTS IDEALLY ON PAPER even though the<br/>orchestra does not PLAY it PERFECTLY ON PITCH EACH AND EVERY TIME.<br/>The SCORE SHEET is the IDEAL and I have given in Arnold&apos;s Law the IDEAL.<br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>Daniel writes:<br/>This is notoriously complex (tried solving<br/>the three-body problem lately?) and all the interest really lies -<br/>for met, at least - in the details. A &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; model,<br/>based upon static, whole number proportions is going to be a gross<br/>simplification of a single moment in a dynamic system -- but how do<br/>you choose the moment?  Pluto&apos;s not always the furthest out.<br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>But Daniel, I THINK NOW you understand that Pluto has a MEAN which is,<br/>indeed, OUTSIDE the orbital of Neptune.  My paper covered all that.<br/>There is, as you express above: A HARMONY OF THE SPHERES MODEL, and you<br/>can SEE it in the DATA above.  It is AWESOMELY BEAUTIFUL like a crystal<br/>emerald with hexagonal six-sides or a diamond with pyramidal eight-sides.<br/>Musicologists can PROBABLY now RELATE to the NUMBERS???????????????</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Y!

Planets travel in elliptical orbits perturbed by each other<br/>gravitationally. So no nice circles with nice &apos;harmonic&apos; relationships.<br/>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>Hi, Mark Gould.  If you read my prior message to this list,</p><p>  <a href="/tuning/topicId_39746.html#39825">/tuning/topicId_39746.html#39825</a></p><p> you will NOW<br/>UNDERSTAND that Plato spoke of the IDEAL and how REALITY shadows or mirrors<br/>the IDEAL.  Musicologists KNOW that an IDEAL F note exists and try to play<br/>it, and like your referred to &quot;elliptical orbits&quot; do NOT always make it.<br/>BTW: members should know that astrophysics explains the individual<br/>&quot;ellipitcal orbits&quot; very nicely as a DANCE of the two centers of the Sun<br/>and the individual planet, and yes, there are other perturbations.  But<br/>as Pauline points out, the same thing happens in REALITY when she plays<br/>her organ and individual pipes INTERFER with each other, or the organist<br/>mis-hits a key, or the pedal was held too-o-o-o-o long, or whatever.  But<br/>the IDEAL Bach piece on the SOCRE SHEET that Pauline looks at, is IDEAL.</p><p>Thus, Mark, there ARE NICE CIRCLES WITH NICE HARMONIC relationships on<br/>paper in the STATISTICAL DATA.  That is ALL Pythagoras or I have said.<br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Actually, &apos;harmonic&apos; ratios of orbital periods are I think unstable as they<br/>are &apos;resonant&apos;. So planets in this configuration probably won&apos;t remain that<br/>way for the long term.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>Are you talking about entropy from an IDEAL state?  This is a LIST about TUNING,<br/>and WHO knows WHO keeps the solar-planetary system TUNED [pun intended :) ]<br/>Actually, Mark, PHYSICS explains ENTROPY as a decaying state over TIME from<br/>an IDEAL state which existed, at some prior point.</p><p>But, can YOU now SEE the IDEAL state in the IDEAL data?  This is NOT a<br/>PHYSICS list, so I will not go into the relationship of the IDEAL solar-planetary<br/>system to TIME, as that is a matter for another day and place.  But Pauline could<br/>tell you much about ENTROPY of pipes TUNED at a certain point in TIME and probably<br/>predict when CERTAIN pipes need to be TUNED anew.  I don&apos;t have a clue :)</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Y!

The layout is quite<br/>simple,<br/>&gt; which I described before.</p><p>so, how many pitches in all three keyboards put together? how many do<br/>you need if you have to play music in all 12 keys?</p></div><h3><a id=39852 href="#39852">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2002 6:22:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39746.html#39828">/tuning/topicId_39746.html#39828</a></p><p>&gt; Hey,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;alternativetuning&quot; &lt;alternativetuning@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I asked my teacher Daniel Wolf about the Music of the Sphere<br/>&gt; &gt; thread, and he emailed to me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...and his message.

So please bear with me, if you are<br/>willing.</p><p>I agree wavelength is PROPORTIONAL to period.  My papers, which<br/>hopefully will be put online by a member of TUNING, covers my<br/>take on that.  The trouble is that the distances between the planets<br/>and the Sun were expressed in fractions of a.u., the distance from<br/>the Sun to the Earth.  Technically, it is a Radian of a Circle.<br/>The Perimeter of the Circle that the Earth travels round the Sun<br/>is Equal to 2 Pi Radians.  That 2 in the mix confused those who<br/>would try to relate all this to MUSIC which in octaval terms<br/>has a 2X factor built into its system, as well.  Thus PERIOD in<br/>planetary terms gets confused with DISTANCE between planets,<br/>whereas they are different terms, inasmuch as PERIOD is a<br/>PERIMETER descriptive term and DISTANCE is either a RADIAN term<br/>or a DIAMETER term.  In my heart of hearts I believe the same is<br/>true in MUSIC but I leave that for MATH minds in music to deal with.<br/>The point is: that in order for planetary DISTANCES or PERIODS to<br/>be related to MUSICAL terms, we must be assured which terms we are<br/>using.  I hope I am being understood.  I know to some this is really<br/>abstruse stuff, but I hope those who don&apos;t care will hit the D button,<br/>and those that do will help out.  I know you CARE and apparently<br/>can relate.  And maybe we can get to a common ground of understanding.<br/>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>&gt; and I wonder if you see the words<br/>&gt; PROPORTIONS<br/>&gt; and HARMONIC/SUBHARMONIC so related?</p><p>they are related. in the old days, before the physical harmonic<br/>series was known (a natural phenomenon in which any tone tends to be<br/>accompanied by tones with integer multiples of its FREQUENCY), string<br/>lengths on monochords were used to compare pitches, and many<br/>theorists demanded simple proportions in those string lengths. string<br/>length is approximately inversely proportional to frequency.</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>my remarks: I think this is where non-musicians in planetary science<br/>have stumbled in attempts to relate the harmonics of the spheres<br/>with planetary distances as I said above.  Let us move on to the<br/>NEW musicology of ALTERNATE TUNING knowledge which seems to have<br/>advanced knowledge since to good ole days.  I am guessing that what<br/>Guy Murchie wrote in MUSIC OF THE SPHERES has been advanced enough<br/>that a NEW take on these matters would improve the understanding.<br/>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/> if these<br/>string-length proportions were ARITHMETIC (that is, in proportions<br/>belonging to the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . .), the result was what is<br/>today known as SUBHARMONIC.</p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>my remarks: I do not think that HARMONIC and SUBHARMONIC as you are<br/>using them are used the same way by cycle-scientists, astrophysicists,<br/>and the like.  Thus, I hope you would make me understand what you mean,<br/>as you seem to make absolute sense to me.  But so many musicologists use<br/>these two terms so differently.<br/>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>if these proportions were HARMONIC (that<br/>is, in proportions belonging to the series 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4,<br/>1/5 . . .), the result was what is today still known as HARMONIC<br/>(though typically expressed today as a set of ARITHMETIC proportions<br/>in FREQUENCY).</p><p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>my remarks: the fact that &quot;today&quot; it is &quot;still known as HARMONIC&quot;<br/>but is &quot;typically expressed...as a set of ARITHMETIC proportions in<br/>FREQUENCY&quot; is what I think confuses the astrophysicsts [my umbrella-word<br/>meaning, of course] who wish to talk to musicologists.  For some reason,<br/>I always lumped words like frequency, harmonic and the like into one<br/>nebulous basket.  And so do many outside the realm of music.  I know<br/>that is NOT proper, inasmuch as you are using MATH as a basis of transference<br/>between TERMS and I must understand what you mean.  So, I hope you bear<br/>with me.  In the IDEAL state of the solar-planetary system, there is<br/>an ARITHMETIC series of NUMBERS which represents the planetary RADIANS:<br/>Sun 0, Mercury 1, Venus 2, Earth 3, Mars 4, Ceres 8, Jupiter 15,<br/>Saturn 30, Uranus 60, Neptune 90, and Pluto 120.</p><p>If we express the same<br/>in DIAMETERS,<br/>obviously the ARITHMETIC series of NUMBERS doubles.</p><p>If we express the<br/>same in PERIMETERS,<br/>obviously the ARITHMETIC series of NUMBERS is only<br/>increased PORPORTIONALLY by the value of PI: 3.14+....</p><p>Thus, I ask<br/>of you: Is this an ARITHMETIC series as I suggest?  If so, is IT a<br/>HARMONIC series?  Or SUBHARMONIC?  And what does IT mean in music<br/>terms?</p><p>I grant that two items, Earth and Neptune, are HALFWAY<br/>between their respective NUMBERS.  And that IS in terms of ARITHMETICS.</p><p>So, I am understanding from your statements, that the PRIMARY series of<br/>ARITHMETIC NUMBERS is OCTAVAL.  And I am understanding that the OTHER<br/>two ARITHMETIC NUMBERS is halfway between them.  We are really talking<br/>about DISTANCES between these NUMBERS, even if we EXPAND the numbers by<br/>2X and again by PI at 3.14+....  Does this help you in telling me which<br/>NOTE I am seeking?</p><p>Can I make the MAGICAL leap to MUSIC with your help?  Please understand,<br/>that because there is a different DEFINITION from one group of scientists<br/>[astrophysicists] to the other [musicologists], there appears to me to<br/>be confusion.  And I am not imply you or I or either group is confused.<br/>On the contrary, I think we need to find the common language, the precise<br/>TERMS and the precise DEFINITIONS.  I hope I haven&apos;t asked for too much?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br/>meant kindly,</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Y!

Of course,<br/>most of my science research was three decades ago.  Although, I<br/>have not given up on it.  More anon.  But let me say at this point,<br/>although I am not cross-posting these remarks to tuning-math, I<br/>am reading the archives on yahoogroups and I do note that there<br/>is disagreement over definition of terms, say lattice from one<br/>discipline to another.  I would also say, that within one discipline,<br/>such as astrophysics, or cycle science, even math itself, certain<br/>knowledgable disciplinarians in those groups use terms differently,<br/>or interchangeably without knowing it at the time.  In other words,<br/>I believe a lot of us could be of assistance to each other in other<br/>disciplines if we could come to a commonality of terms.  Not that<br/>that will happen, or should.  But it is a confusion to science,<br/>whether musicology or astrophysics or cycle-science and even math,<br/>if disciplinarians are not aware that they are not using the same<br/>transference terms to express ideas, and sometimes they are using<br/>the same transference terms but defining terms differently.  Accepting<br/>this: we can proceed.</p><p>I will not take it up in detail now, but at some point my BODE&apos;S LAW<br/>EXPLAIN paper should be online, in the near future, and we could go<br/>into detail as warranted.  But I would say, as a disciplinarian in<br/>disciplines outside music, that PERIOD and PERIODICITY contain TIME<br/>within the expression.  Briefly: the PERIODS of planets round the<br/>Sun are not the same, as the DISTANCES between them might be PROPORTIONAL<br/>but the PERIODS contain different RATES OF SPEED, if my memory serves me<br/>correctly.  Perhaps, in music, the PERIODS of NOTES might NOT find<br/>different expression because they are NOT related to each other differently.<br/>Am I to assume that the RATES OF SPEED of NOTES are the SAME in ALL<br/>cases?  Perhaps, you understand my point?  This pertains to your remarks<br/>below about the MEDIUM OF SOUND.</p><p>Indeed, supposedly, outer SPACE is supposedly CURVED, according<br/>to Einstein&apos;s Theory of Relativity, and IF SPHERICAL contains PI at<br/>3.14+ ad infinitum, and OBJECTS in outer SPACE appear SPHERICAL, that<br/>IS the SHELL MEDIUM according to modern astronomy, then we have MEDIUMS<br/>placed within a supposed-VACUUM.</p><p>However, musicologists know better than I what would happen IF a TUNING<br/>fork placed in MEDIUM and VIBRATED, separated by a VACUUM--whether or<br/>not it could be PERCEIVED in an ADJACENT MEDIUM.  Tough question: and not<br/>one I am sure has been scientifically tested.  Maybe there would be NO<br/>transmission of SOUND, but might there be a transmission of VIBRATIONS.<br/>And what is LIGHT but vibrations, measured in cycles per TIME?</p><p>Thus, what I am saying in a convoluted way IS that the formulas you bring<br/>forward still are relevant, although they may NOT be applicable to the<br/>situation.  In other words, if the relationships between FREQUENCY and<br/>PERIOD and DISTANCE are fixed, which I accept are, then the CONCEPTS ought<br/>to make sense INTELLECTUALLY and we ought to be able to related MUSIC to<br/>ASTRONOMY in MATHEMATICAL and PHYSICS terms.  I do not know: you tell me!</p><p>What I see as a barrier to understanding is that MUSIC is NOTES and the<br/>FREQUENCY and DISTANCE relationships are the SIZES of ATOMS.  Whereas,<br/>the analogy might be the same, but ASTRONOMY/ASTROPHYSICS is LARGER BODIES<br/>called STARS/SUN and PLANETS and the FREQUENCY and DISTANCE relationships are<br/>the SIZES of SOLAR-PLANETARY SYSTEMS, and LARGER still, GALAXIES, and larger<br/>still, UNIVERSES [pun intended, making that plural :) ].</p><p>Still I ask: would the INORDINATE SIZE OF DISTANCE at the level of solar-planetary<br/>systems make as difference in comparison with MUSICAL NOTES IN SCALES?</p><p>Is it possible, that in MUSIC the lattices and notes and other items you all<br/>are relating, by math, by structure in a physic[cal] sense, et al., that they<br/>are easier to INTER-RELATE because they are the SIZES of ATOMS.  In other words,<br/>they are SMALL and the DISTANCE relationships are equally SMALL and problems<br/>of MAGNIFICATION of NUMBERS does NOT play into the discussion?</p><p>But is it also possible, that in MUSIC that NOTES might not be related to each<br/>other in SPIRAL lattices, but GEOMETRIC shapes: whether HEXAGONAL or the more<br/>sophisticated SPHERICAL?  Might it be that the root NOTE in a chord or a series<br/>is ENCASED by other NOTES as opposed to SEPARATE MEDIUMS separated by empty<br/>SPACE between them akin to VACUUMS if the outer SPACE analogy is brought into<br/>the equation [pun intended]?</p><p>Finally: I did EQUATE two formulas as you do above.  I believe that the<br/>CIRCUMFERENCE OR PERIMETER or PI DISTANCE a planet travels round the Sun<br/>is equal to PI times DIAMETER or 2 RADIANS of that planet<br/>[the old C = PI D formula].</p><p>I also believe that the PI DISTANCE a planet travels round the Sun is also<br/>equal to the RATE OF SPEED of the planet in question times the TIME it takes for<br/>the planet to complete one TRIP around<br/>[the old D = tr formula].</p><p>By EQUATING these two commonly known formulas, wherein the PI DISTANCE around<br/>the sun that a planet travels are common to both: PI time DIAMETER equals<br/>TIME of the trip around times RATE OF SPEED of the planet during its trip.</p><p>Thus: whether ATOMS or SOLAR-PLANETARY SYSTEMS, the PARTICLE moving round<br/>the CENTER, shares these relationships.  Or PARTICLES.</p><p>I wonder if the latter formula has APPLICATION to MUSIC?</p><p>Could it be that NOTES are ATOMIC in structure?<br/>Do they have PARTICLES going around a CENTER?<br/>What do musicologists mean when they say a NOTE VIBRATES?<br/>Do NOTES have SHELL structure?<br/>Has anyone done DIFFRACTION PATTERNS of NOTES aka ATOMIC STRUCTURE?</p><p>[By the way: these remarks above are meant to be exploratory for musicologists,<br/>and other disciplines, and I took them out of my memory without attempts at<br/>this point to related them to the MUSIC formulas given above.  I mean all<br/>this input as kindly intended to open up dialogue and not be contrary and<br/>argumentative with a discipline, musicology, I admit I have much to learn<br/>about.</p><p>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus, I ask<br/>&gt; of you: Is this an ARITHMETIC series as I suggest?</p><p>i suppose, since you gave a set of integers, this can be viewed as an<br/>incomplete arithmetic series.</p><p>&gt; If so, is IT a<br/>&gt; HARMONIC series?

But have you considered what the<br/>PROPORTIONAL PERIODS are for ALL the planets as expressed by the ARITHMETICAL<br/>SERIES OF NUMBERS we are dealing with?  That is: Sun 0, Mercury 1, Venus 2,<br/>Earth 3, Mars 4, etc.</p><p>In other words: Mercury is 88 Earth days.  Thus, in the series above, we find<br/>that the PERIODS do not show the SAME PROPORTIONALITY as the DISTANCES or RADIANS<br/>from the Sun because in the formula, the RATES OF SPEEDS of the planets VARY and<br/>are NOT PROPORTIONAL in the same ways the the DISTANCES.  At least such is my<br/>understanding but I am willing to be corrected in my current assessment.</p><p>What I am suggesting IS that perhaps musicologists ought to INVESTIGATE the<br/>MATH and PHYSICS of NOTES, their FREQUENCY, their PERIOD, their PERIODICITY,<br/>and yes, in my way of SEEING it, whether or not, it is dreamlike as you suggest,<br/>thus: in their DISTANCES or RADIANS from their respective CENTERS and their<br/>respective VIBRATION ORBITALS.  It is my firm belief, based on MATH and PHYSICS<br/>that the reason Pythagoras SAW what he did IS because there IS such a SIMILARITY<br/>between the DISTANCES between the planets as there are between the NOTES in<br/>the C Octave as I have suggested on this message board.  We will get to that<br/>understanding, of verification or denial of it, only by investigation.</p><p>I, Bill Arnold, wrote: &quot;Am I to assume that the RATES OF SPEED of NOTES are the<br/>SAME in ALL cases?&quot;<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_39746.html#40105">/tuning/topicId_39746.html#40105</a></p><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote, &quot;notes don&apos;t move. sound moves, usually around 750 mph<br/>or something in average-temperature, average humidity air.&quot;<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_39746.html#40137">/tuning/topicId_39746.html#40137</a></p><p>I, Bill Arnold, write: I believe that perhaps this is worthy of some discussion.<br/>By calculations, atoms are shown to have SIZE: they have a CENTER or NUCLEUS and<br/>ORBITALS or PARTICLES moving round in an ENCLOSED SPACE.  I SEE the SAME in the<br/>solar-planetary system and I SEE the SAME in DIFFRACTION PATTERNS of atoms as put<br/>forth years ago by Rutherford.  It seems reasonable to me, because the MATH and<br/>PHYSICS of music is quantified, termed and defined, that a similarity probably<br/>EXISTS, theoretically, in music and awaits amplification.  By this I suggest that<br/>musical NOTES can be put in LATTICES like PERIODIC ELEMENT tables because they ARE<br/>IN FACT comparable.  It is up to the musicologists to do this, as you ALL apparently<br/>are working on it on TUNING and TUNING-MATH and elsewhere.  I do NOT conclude that<br/>NOTES have NECESSARILY a CENTER and ORIBTALS, but WHY NOT?  Why should they defy<br/>the LAWS OF MATH and the LAWS OF PHYSICS and not have SIZE?  Pauline pointed out<br/>that an OCTAVE creates LOUDNESS in the HIGHER REGISTER NOTE when BOTH are struck<br/>together on an organ.

As I pointed out in<br/>my BODE&apos;S LAW EXPLAINED paper, the ancient Greeks had a very sophisticated and<br/>quite accurate MODEL of the solar-planetary system which was displaced by<br/>Ptolemy.  Copernicus only revived what was already accepted millennium ago: a<br/>HELIOCENTRIC solar-planetary system.  The history is well document, from which<br/>I summarize the details in my cited paper.  Kepler, in fact, argued that they<br/>were six-sided HEXAGONAL SHELLS, and what are musicologists&apos; LATTICES but attempts<br/>to get at the SAME arrangements.  What I am suggesting, however, is that BOTH<br/>the HEXAGON and the CIRCLE or the DODECAHEDRON and the SPHERE are relevant.  My<br/>Arnold&apos;s law has both series: the hexagonal Sun 0, Mercury 3, Venus 6, etc., and<br/>the circle Sun 0, Mercury 3.14+, Venus 6.28+, etc.  In my mind, it seems REASONABLE<br/>that SOUNDS [that is to say: NOTES] are CENTERED and RADIATE OUT in an ever INCREASING<br/>SPHERE ad infinitum until the ENERGY dissipates or meets resistance.  That is the<br/>nature of the MATH and PHYSICS of SOUND and hence, MUSIC.  Therefore, those SIZE<br/>attributes of NOTES ought to be able to be quantified and would redefinte what<br/>I believe I hear musicologists referring to as PERIOD and PERIODICITY.  Hey: this<br/>is THEORY and what is wrong with MUSIC THEORY being considered?</p><p>I, Bill Arnold wrote, &quot;However, musicologists know better than I what would<br/>happen IF a TUNING fork placed in MEDIUM and VIBRATED, separated by a VACUUM--<br/>whether or not it could be PERCEIVED in an ADJACENT MEDIUM.
