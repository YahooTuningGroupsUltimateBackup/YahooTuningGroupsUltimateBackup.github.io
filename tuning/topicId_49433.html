My approach was based on Carl Lumma&apos;s &quot;xenharmonic moving windows&quot;<br/>specification for a GUI to do tonic shifts which he posted<br/>to MakeMicroMusic (I think it was), maybe a year or so ago -<br/>not that I followed it exactly but used ideas from it.<br/>Then various ideas sugested by users of FTS - it does get<br/>used though I think only rather occasionally so far.</p><p>It really comes into its own for sequencer use as you<br/>just need to add a silent retuning channel - have to make sure<br/>the tuning changing notes in that channnel happen just before the chords<br/>that they are affecting.</p><p>Interesting to compare notes. My one is in<br/>FTS | View | Midi Keyboard Retuning | Tonic Shifts<br/>with various options there.</p><p>Main ones relevant here are M.W. scale + Tonic shifts,<br/>and + Tonic Drift.</p><p>If you click on the button then it says what it does<br/>before you click the OK.

The other one<br/>has tonic shifts - well both do but the dovetail<br/>one is useful for melodic lines that pivot at the<br/>tonic.</p><p>What happens then is that you have a part tht you<br/>use to do the tonic shifts, and you can either map that to a region of<br/>the music keyboard, or to one of the input channels<br/>or the controller etc. You then have fifteen<br/>other polyphonic parts which can be tuned<br/>individually to any scale you like and in this<br/>case they are tuned tonic shifted copies of the main window scale,<br/>so the tonic shifting then just chooses which of those<br/>parts to play.</p><p>In fact you can hear a comparison of my tunings using<br/>this tonic shifting and JdLs tunings of the same<br/>piece on-line at<br/><a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#7_limit_adaptive_puzzle">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/tunes/tunes.htm#7_limit_adaptive_puzzle</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49711 href="#49711">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Wakefield Sault &#x3C;sault@cyberware.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2003 7:23:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Peter Frazer &lt;paf@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In tuning digest 2861 Peter Sault wrote ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [&gt;SNIP]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt; As before, excuse me if I have some catching up to do.

I know you are working on a<br/>&gt; microtonal sequencer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, a real number in floating point is typically<br/>&gt; 8 bytes as opposed to 1 for note number so there would be much more<br/>&gt; data to send.  But then midi is now a very old standard so speed is<br/>&gt; probably not an issue.  What may be an issue is that midi short<br/>messages<br/>&gt; are small enough to fit in a Windows message structure whereas<br/>something<br/>&gt; containing a real would not.  This may have implications for the<br/>fast<br/>&gt; transfer of data from one application to another.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Computers are a zillion times faster nowadays making external<br/>hardware synths obsolete for that reason. Ok so we still have to plug<br/>in MIDI controller instruments for manual performance but there is<br/>now USB and Firewire. The problem is convincing the MIDI controller<br/>instrument makers to catch up - and replace MIDI with something<br/>slightly less horrible. For my purposes there is no external data<br/>connexion needed anyway - it all goes via internal buffers.

Since I wish to<br/>know,<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;for each and every note, its particular key I store pitch<br/>numbers as<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;a combination of octave number (0-11), root pitch (0-11, where 0<br/>= C)<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;and offset from that root (0-11).

The only question here is which<br/>imperfection<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;one is prepared to accept for a particular piece, ET mini-wolves<br/>or<br/>&gt;  &gt;&gt;JI pitch drift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;All very true and well put, except there is a third sort of<br/>option,<br/>&gt;  &gt;around here known as &quot;adaptive tuning&quot;.  It makes mini-shifts by<br/>&gt;  &gt;tempering *melodic* intervals (such as between roots).  Paul<br/>Erlich<br/>&gt;  &gt;pointed out that by rooting to meantone in the proper key, the<br/>&gt;  &gt;root could return to concert pitch for most &quot;&quot;diatonic&quot;&quot; music,<br/>&gt;  &gt;while the shifts between adjacent common tones is kept at a<br/>minimum.<br/>&gt;  &gt;If you don&apos;t know the key in advance you can root to ET.  And if<br/>&gt;  &gt;you know all the notes in the piece in advance you can root to<br/>&gt;  &gt;COFT (Calculated Optimum Fixed Temperament), per John<br/>deLaubenfels&apos;<br/>&gt;  &gt;idea.

That&apos;s why MIDI is defective and inadequate to<br/>the task of complete musical freedom. You keep thinking &apos;keyboard<br/>keyboard keyboard&apos;. It&apos;s very limiting. Everyone has attacked me for<br/>being the Great Defender of Dodekaphony and rattles on about other<br/>divisions of the octave but the simple fact is that MIDI is locked<br/>into dodekaphony. Personally I am simply not prepared to deal with<br/>the complexities of trying to play in, for example, a 19-pitch octave<br/>by clunking about with 12 pitch numbers.

I wouldn&apos;t have thought<br/>&gt; that was too difficult to master.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Also works from sequencer)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p><p>There&apos;s a problem in that too. The modulation bridge note<br/>(or &apos;pivot&apos;) need not be the tonic of the new key.

What is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vibration number addressable?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter Frazer,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MIDI provides absolute pitch number addressing, where pitch<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; number 0<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; = C0. The synthesizer is expected to translate the pitch number<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; into<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a vibration number (i.e. a specific frequency in Hz).<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The concept of vibration number addressing is that the<br/>&gt; synthesizer<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has only to respond with a note of the requested vibration<br/>&gt; number.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vibration numbers are reals, unlike pitch numbers which are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; naturals.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I ask the synth to give me 123.4567Hz and that is what I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; should<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get. A task which MIDI is not up to, so far as I know, since it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; does<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not encode reals.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are right.  A protocol which allowed frequency to be<br/>&gt; specified<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a real number rather than note number would greatly facilitate<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; microtonal<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sequencing and other software.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Monz, are you reading this thread?  I know you are working on a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; microtonal sequencer.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, a real number in floating point is typically<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8 bytes as opposed to 1 for note number so there would be much<br/>&gt; more<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; data to send.  But then midi is now a very old standard so speed<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably not an issue.  What may be an issue is that midi short<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; messages<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are small enough to fit in a Windows message structure whereas<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; something<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; containing a real would not.  This may have implications for the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fast<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; transfer of data from one application to another.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Computers are a zillion times faster nowadays making external<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; hardware synths obsolete for that reason. Ok so we still have to<br/>&gt; plug<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; in MIDI controller instruments for manual performance but there is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; now USB and Firewire. The problem is convincing the MIDI<br/>&gt; controller<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; instrument makers to catch up - and replace MIDI with something<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly less horrible. For my purposes there is no external data<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; connexion needed anyway - it all goes via internal buffers. I<br/>&gt; take it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; your program accepts MIDI-streams from Cakewalk and the suchlike.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Accepting plugins would be one way of escaping from MIDI and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; specifying your own standard.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter S.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That convincing may take some time.  First of all the majority of<br/>&gt; the market<br/>&gt;&gt; has to become sophisticated enough to recognize the functional<br/>&gt; benefits of a<br/>&gt;&gt; fully-flexible protocol.  Secondly the market would be unlikely to<br/>&gt;&gt; distinguish a hack to a bad protocol from a better protocol, and<br/>&gt; the former<br/>&gt;&gt; would cost the industry less in making the adjustment.  So it will<br/>&gt; probably<br/>&gt;&gt; happen some day, when the cost of making the transition hits zero.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I brought up the problems with MIDI on the apple CoreAudio list and<br/>&gt; I was<br/>&gt;&gt; treated somewhat like an alien.  But it was pointed out to me that<br/>&gt; apple&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; internal musical instrument interface (a kind of audio unit, I<br/>&gt; forget the<br/>&gt;&gt; exact name) does not suffer the limitations of MIDI, while also<br/>&gt; supporting<br/>&gt;&gt; it as one means of control.  However apple has no current interest<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt;&gt; motivations to consider changes to the external protocol.  This<br/>&gt; might be a<br/>&gt;&gt; slight misrepresentation since the conversation was more than a<br/>&gt; year ago,<br/>&gt;&gt; but I think the gist of it is correct.  Meanwhile MTS is arriving<br/>&gt; to serve<br/>&gt;&gt; our purposes relatively well, and we can welcome the day when even<br/>&gt; that is<br/>&gt;&gt; implemented fully in all its flavors, and also accurately enough to<br/>&gt; satisfy<br/>&gt;&gt; the tuning-sensitive contingent.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Finally, the very fact that so much customization and workarounds<br/>&gt; can be<br/>&gt;&gt; done in software actually reduces the pressure for changes to MIDI.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Kurt<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to stick to my own solution. Since I am not trying to<br/>&gt; achieve realtime performance there is much I can dispense with,<br/>&gt; including MUDDY. I have written a program that will precisely adjust<br/>&gt; WAV samples, always maintaining the proper slope of the waveform,<br/>&gt; that takes as input parameters either old and new frequencies or a<br/>&gt; single coefficient. Then I paste it into a track using SoundForge.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s how I created &apos;Babylon&apos; - my first using my software:-<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.odeion.org/music/pws-babylon-l.mp3">http://www.odeion.org/music/pws-babylon-l.mp3</a>          = 32kb/s 11kHz<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.odeion.org/music/pws-babylon-h.mp3">http://www.odeion.org/music/pws-babylon-h.mp3</a>          = 128kb/s 44kHz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It works for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter.</p><p>Now why didn&apos;t you just say that in the first place?

I was working<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; in isolation at the time and it seemed to me an obvious step forward<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to use the capabilities of computers to shift Just Intonation into a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; new key at the apposite time.  I still believe that this type of re-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuning is appropriate in some instances (like Peter Saults algorithmic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; composition) and I hope that I have made a contribution here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; As I understand it your &quot;dynamic retuning&quot; allows the composer to<br/>&gt;&gt; specify roots on a dedicated MIDI channel.  This is in a totally<br/>&gt;&gt; different league than automatic retuning, in my book.  The additional<br/>&gt;&gt; choice may take a lifetime to master for different scales, but it<br/>&gt;&gt; also brings a world of compositional opportunities that automatic<br/>&gt;&gt; retuning cannot.  Apples and oranges.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Carl.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The basic idea of dynamic re-tuning is that you could have a midi<br/>&gt; pedal board on the re-tuning channel and hit the new key note<br/>&gt; typically during a modulation pivot chord.  I wouldn&apos;t have thought<br/>&gt; that was too difficult to master.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Also works from sequencer)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Peter.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p><p>Its not difficult as long as you sufficiently restrict your possibilities!</p><p>Carl and I have been working on this in our &quot;spare time&quot; on my software<br/>organ, and before me, Carl was working with others on a design (called<br/>&quot;xenharmonic moving windows&quot;).  But without biasing the current conversation<br/>with our experiences, what would you propose as a protocol for a musician<br/>with a pedalboard to allow an arbitrary modulation with an arbitrary common<br/>tone, or as Peter I think calls the same thing &quot;bridge note&quot;.</p><p>So far I have dealt with the situation in which either the common tone is<br/>either the old tonic or the new tonic, based on an arbitrary protocol in<br/>which upward and downward movements on the pedalboard select one or the<br/>other.  I have been thinking about other solutions involving using a<br/>temporary change to an intermediate key which I think allows any note to<br/>then be common, though I have not analyzed or tested this extensively.  So<br/>it requires 2 pedal key-presses per modulation in the general case.  This is<br/>awkward and interferes with performance.  It can be improved upon by various<br/>tricks, such as allowing the intermediate key to be recognized by an time<br/>overlap with the prevous pedal key and a kind of mono-mode functioning.<br/>This is probably not brilliantly clear since I am in a rush.</p><p>But just to pose the question to you again, with a specific example.  Lets<br/>say you have a 12-tone scale based on the harmonic series.  Carl gave me<br/>this one, which is quite useful, perhaps in some sense optimal:</p><p>    16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:26:27:28:30</p><p>And suppose you have a 3:4:5 (12:16:20) chord at G-C-E and you want the E to<br/>remain at fixed pitch as you hold the same 3 keys and you want the chord to<br/>become an 11:15:19, with the bottom 2 notes retuning to create this.  (I<br/>hope I got that right.)</p><p>This is not necessarily the most musically useful example, but that was too<br/>much to come up with quickly here.</p><p>What protocol for pedal use would you suggest to achieve such freedom of<br/>choice while playing?</p><p>I see that Robert Walker has posted something related to this, but have not<br/>had the time to analyze it.

Perhaps I may<br/>have a go at implementing that too, sounds<br/>a useful idea.</p><p>In my program there is a retuning octave,<br/>and player chooses which note to use for the bridge note.<br/>So you can choose any note for that. You have<br/>one octave of the keyboard set aside for that<br/>(in twelve tone scales) so to tune to the current<br/>note played, player needs to play the same<br/>note simultaneously in the retuning octave.<br/>If you want the bridge note to be an Ab<br/>play an Ab in the retuning octave.<br/>Also if the music is beginning to drift<br/>and you want to reset with a diesis shift<br/>I do it so that you just play a note twice,<br/>e.. C twice to reset to the original pitch<br/>for the C.</p><p>That wouldn&apos;t be very convenient really for<br/>more complex pieces though as you<br/>have to keep playing notes over in the retuning<br/>octave - which I normally put at leftmost<br/>octave of keyboard but it can go anywhere<br/>(even in the middle if one likes).</p><p>One could alternatively<br/>have an extra small keyboard relaying it<br/>on another midi channel in order to not<br/>lose any of the area of ones main keyboard.</p><p>Alternatively you can also use a foot controller<br/>- there the problem is that the 12 notes<br/>requires rather fine control of the controller<br/>Though there is visual feedback to show<br/>which note you selected for retuning, it requires rather<br/>fine control for twelve note scales. Perhaps<br/>one could learn to use that method.</p><p>It isn&apos;t so hard for e.g. pentatonic scales.<br/>and all these methods are suitable for use from<br/>a sequencer of course.</p><p>However, if one were to get a pedal keyboard<br/>(what are they called? - the things that<br/>organists use to play using their feet) - just needs to be<br/>one octave, then the player could select<br/>the bridge note using the feet. Then<br/>still have another pedal board for<br/>your other method, if the bridge note is<br/>the current note played as that might be<br/>conceptually easier than simultaneously playing the<br/>identical note on the pedals probably.</p><p>How does that sound?</p><p>I think with my program the problem has been<br/>partly that the GUI is still a bit rough<br/>- everything works but it looks more complex<br/>at first sight than it really is when you<br/>use it, and it isn&apos;t so immediately obvious<br/>to a first time user how it works I think.</p><p>I&apos;m going through the program<br/>at present highlighting various of the things<br/>it can do and doing a special GUI &quot;view&quot; for each one<br/>designed to make them easier to use and when<br/>I get to this one then it will make it easier to use.</p><p>Anyway maybe by sharing and pooling our ideas<br/>we can  come up with something better together.<br/>Hope maybe some of these ideas I use may help,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49791 href="#49791">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 11:26:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Peter Frazer &lt;paf@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not quite sure what you mean here Gene, could you point me<br/>&gt; to a reference?</p><p><a href="http://www.linet.gr.jp/~tamuki/timidity/mts/tuning.html">http://www.linet.gr.jp/~tamuki/timidity/mts/tuning.html</a></p><p>&gt; By base 128 I assume you mean 7 bit numbers so 21 bits,<br/>&gt; 2 million or so combinations, but why 2.1072 digits?</p><p>128 is a bit larger than 100, and base 100 uses digits from 00 to 99,<br/>or exactly two digits worth of base 10.

What is actually<br/>&gt; happening here? Please give an example.</p><p>Rightio - yes my bridge notes are just the new tonics<br/>in the new scales. So if say you start at C and<br/>you want to change to an E then the E remains at its<br/>pitch whatever it is so far (say 5/4), but all the other notes get retuned to<br/>make E the new tonic. Change now to say Ab as the tonic and<br/>the Ab is now at perhaps 25/16, but the other notes all<br/>get retuned so since our original tuning had<br/>pure major thirds, now C is 125/64.</p><p>But this isn&apos;t the most general one can have.</p><p>Maybe one wants to do a bridge somewhere else<br/>other than the tonic.</p><p>E.g. set E = 5/4 to the 3/2 of the new scale.<br/>I.e. change the key to A major, with E as the<br/>bridge note.</p><p>My method can&apos;t handle it to that generality yet.<br/>The bridge note is always set to the tonic of the<br/>new scale. It means you can only change the tuning<br/>when you play the tonic of the new scale.</p><p>I see that really you have two notes to set there<br/>- the bridge note and the new tonic.</p><p>So that is more of a challenge to the User Interface.<br/>I suppose you could do it by saying that<br/>the bridge note is to be the current note played<br/>in a melody line, or a best fit for the notes currently in play<br/>for a chord,and user just changes the tonic. Come to think<br/>of it that is probably what Peter is describing.</p><p>That sounds like a far more natural system<br/>to play with. User doesn&apos;t need to bother<br/>about the bridge notes, so the music always<br/>dovetails about at least one note, and just set the<br/>tonic to change to.</p><p>So if piece moves to a perceived new key,<br/>user can simply set the<br/>new tonic to that key. Or to the roots<br/>of the chords perhaps in j.i. where you can&apos;t<br/>even keep triads nicely tuned within a single<br/>diatonic key.</p><p>Perhaps also have some optional way of setting the<br/>bridge note too if user wants to. There a<br/>natural idea is to use a second note played<br/>in the tonic shifting channel or octave - and<br/>have rule that the first note played there<br/>is the desired new tonic, then befoer<br/>you play any new notes to be retuned,<br/>optionally you can then play a second<br/>note as a broken chord so program<br/>can tell it is second (and not a new tonic because<br/>the old tonic is still held down) and that then is<br/>the desired bridge note.</p><p>With that system, user can set the bridge note<br/>to anything i they like, not necessarily<br/>to any note currently in play. But if not<br/>set then it gets found by the software<br/>by some heuristics to dovetail as nicely as possible.</p><p>Still retain the idea of a double press of the same<br/>tonic in succession resets the tuning in case of<br/>tonic drift. Or could have some other system there,<br/>say that hold down the new tonic + a special &quot;reset&quot; note<br/>simultaneously.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49816 href="#49816">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Frazer &#x3C;paf@easynet.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 1:33:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, 13 Dec 2003 01:13:34 -0800 Kurt Bigler  wrote</p><p>&gt;on 12/12/03 3:08 PM, Peter Frazer &lt;<a href="mailto:paf@easynet.co.uk">paf@easynet.co.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; In tuning digest 2863 Carl wrote<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree that John deLaubenfels adaptive tuning ( and the more recent<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hermode tuning ) are superior in many respects to my &quot;dynamic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; re-tuning&quot; as implemented in Midicode Synthesizer.  I was working<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in isolation at the time and it seemed to me an obvious step forward<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to use the capabilities of computers to shift Just Intonation into a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new key at the apposite time.  I still believe that this type of re-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tuning is appropriate in some instances (like Peter Saults algorithmic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; composition) and I hope that I have made a contribution here.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; As I understand it your &quot;dynamic retuning&quot; allows the composer to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; specify roots on a dedicated MIDI channel.  This is in a totally<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; different league than automatic retuning, in my book.  The additional<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; choice may take a lifetime to master for different scales, but it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; also brings a world of compositional opportunities that automatic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; retuning cannot.  Apples and oranges.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Thanks Carl.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The basic idea of dynamic re-tuning is that you could have a midi</p><p>&gt;&gt; pedal board on the re-tuning channel and hit the new key note<br/>&gt;&gt; typically during a modulation pivot chord.  I wouldn&apos;t have thought<br/>&gt;&gt; that was too difficult to master.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; (Also works from sequencer)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Peter.<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p><p>Hi Kurt,</p><p>&gt;Its not difficult as long as you sufficiently restrict your possibilities!</p><p>Absolutely.  What I did was really quite simple so it was easy to get it<br/>working.</p><p>&gt;Carl and I have been working on this in our &quot;spare time&quot; on my software<br/>&gt;organ, and before me, Carl was working with others on a design (called<br/>&gt;&quot;xenharmonic moving windows&quot;).  But without biasing the current conversation<br/>&gt;with our experiences, what would you propose as a protocol for a musician<br/>&gt;with a pedalboard to allow an arbitrary modulation with an arbitrary common<br/>&gt;tone, or as Peter I think calls the same thing &quot;bridge note&quot;.</p><p>&gt;So far I have dealt with the situation in which either the common tone is<br/>&gt;either the old tonic or the new tonic, based on an arbitrary protocol in<br/>&gt;which upward and downward movements on the pedalboard select one or the<br/>&gt;other.  I have been thinking about other solutions involving using a<br/>&gt;temporary change to an intermediate key which I think allows any note to<br/>&gt;then be common, though I have not analyzed or tested this extensively.  So<br/>&gt;it requires 2 pedal key-presses per modulation in the general case.  This is<br/>&gt;awkward and interferes with performance.  It can be improved upon by various<br/>&gt;tricks, such as allowing the intermediate key to be recognized by an time<br/>&gt;overlap with the prevous pedal key and a kind of mono-mode functioning.<br/>&gt;This is probably not brilliantly clear since I am in a rush.</p><p>What you and Carl have been working on is more complex.</p><p>&gt;But just to pose the question to you again, with a specific example.  Lets<br/>&gt;say you have a 12-tone scale based on the harmonic series.  Carl gave me<br/>&gt;this one, which is quite useful, perhaps in some sense optimal:</p><p>&gt;    16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:26:27:28:30</p><p>&gt;And suppose you have a 3:4:5 (12:16:20) chord at G-C-E and you want the E to<br/>&gt;remain at fixed pitch as you hold the same 3 keys and you want the chord to<br/>&gt;become an 11:15:19, with the bottom 2 notes retuning to create this.  (I<br/>&gt;hope I got that right.)</p><p>I have tried to analyse this and can not see what your new tuning would be.<br/>Can you give a full set of ratios for your scale after modulation or tell me the<br/>new key note, please?</p><p>&gt;This is not necessarily the most musically useful example, but that was too<br/>&gt;much to come up with quickly here.</p><p>&gt;What protocol for pedal use would you suggest to achieve such freedom of<br/>&gt;choice while playing?</p><p>I don&apos;t know Kurt.</p><p>Let me give a simple example of what dynamic re-tuning does in Just Intonation.<br/>Suppose we are in C major</p><p>C        1/1<br/>C#    16/15<br/>D        9/8<br/>Eb      6/5<br/>E        5/4<br/>F        4/3<br/>F#    45/32<br/>G       3/2<br/>G#     8/5<br/>A       5/3<br/>Bb     9/5<br/>B     15/8<br/>C       2/1</p><p>You hold a chord of C-E-G and hit the G pedal to modulate.  Shift the<br/>original scale to G and multiply by 3/2 to get the new tuning.</p><p>C         1/1<br/>C#    135/128<br/>D         9/8<br/>Eb       6/5<br/>E         5/4<br/>F       27/20<br/>F#       6/4<br/>G        3/2<br/>G#      8/5<br/>A      27/16<br/>Bb      9/5<br/>B      15/8<br/>C       2/1</p><p>So in this example the notes of your pivot chord do not move but other scale<br/>degrees are now tuned to the new tonic of G.</p><p>&gt;I see that Robert Walker has posted something related to this, but have not<br/>&gt;had the time to analyze it.

Perhaps I may<br/>&gt; have a go at implementing that too, sounds<br/>&gt; a useful idea.</p><p>I don&apos;t have the time to reply to your full post right now, but I&apos;ll clarify<br/>this point so you realize how I am really doing it.  In fact xmw<br/>(Xenharmonic Moving Windows) has had something called &quot;crossfree&quot; mode and I<br/>fleshed that out by adding &quot;diamondfree&quot; (which I&apos;m pretty sure is different<br/>from &quot;diamondrel&quot; but I have not assimilated it all yet).  Then I created 2<br/>more modes:</p><p>    crossfree-up/diamondfree-down</p><p>    diamondfree-up/crossfree-down</p><p>Where up and down relate to the direction of motion on the control channel<br/>(the pedalboard).  I don&apos;t remember which of the two I like best.  But there<br/>are some things about these that can become somewhat intuitive even if they<br/>seem arbitrary.  And there are always ways to have the choice of either up<br/>or down when playing, if you have at least a 2 octave pedalboard, because<br/>you can substitute octaves at any time as an intermediate step which causes<br/>no modulation itself but which affects the availability/convenience of the<br/>up/down choice for the subsequent modulation.</p><p>In any case diamondfree is to crossfree as diamond is to cross, and you can<br/>also say diamondfree is simply crossfree with the modulation scale inverted<br/>in the octave (intervals reversed top-to-bottom).  If you look at how<br/>crossfree and diamondfree behave it might not be exactly as I stated things,<br/>but it might.  In crossfree I think the new tonic is the common tone.  In<br/>diamondfree the old tonic is the common tone.  In any case I am sure about<br/>the following, which is useful:  If you do a modulation in crossfree and the<br/>reverse modulation in diamondfree, you end up back where you started.  This<br/>reduces absolute drifting which otherwise becomes much too horrendous for<br/>keyboard playing since within 60 seconds perhaps the keyboard range has<br/>shifted out of the audible range!</p><p>That&apos;s all for now.  Glad to have more thinkers.

E.g., in modulating from C to F:-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;C D E F G A B ==&gt; F G A Bb C D E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;where the bridge would *never* involve melodic motion from B to Bb to<br/>&gt;achieve the modulation. The last note of the old key is always some<br/>&gt;or other note of the new key also - and vice versa. However, that<br/>&gt;note need not be the tonic of either. In fact there can be several<br/>&gt;notes in succession which are common to both keys - extending the<br/>&gt;ambiguity. This should also apply if the modulation is achieved via a<br/>&gt;chord progression where one can talk of common chords, such as Am7 in<br/>&gt;the example, instead of common notes. Does that clarify?</p><p>Not really.  If a bunch of notes don&apos;t change in JI after a modulation,<br/>they don&apos;t change, and you&apos;re done.  But if you want one that *does*<br/>change not to change, this can be done by adjusting the concert pitch<br/>of the tuning immediately after the modulation.  In this case one has<br/>to specify which not he doesn&apos;t want to change, in addition to the<br/>new tonic (if they are not the same).  Unless your program tries to do<br/>that automatically...   ?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=49840 href="#49840">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 7:53:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/13/03 1:33 PM, Peter Frazer &lt;<a href="mailto:paf@easynet.co.uk">paf@easynet.co.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On Sat, 13 Dec 2003 01:13:34 -0800 Kurt Bigler  wrote<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; on 12/12/03 3:08 PM, Peter Frazer &lt;<a href="mailto:paf@easynet.co.uk">paf@easynet.co.uk</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; In tuning digest 2863 Carl wrote<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree that John deLaubenfels adaptive tuning ( and the more recent<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hermode tuning ) are superior in many respects to my &quot;dynamic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; re-tuning&quot; as implemented in Midicode Synthesizer.

I wouldn&apos;t have thought<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; that was too difficult to master.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (Also works from sequencer)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Kurt,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Its not difficult as long as you sufficiently restrict your possibilities!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely.  What I did was really quite simple so it was easy to get it<br/>&gt; working.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Carl and I have been working on this in our &quot;spare time&quot; on my software<br/>&gt;&gt; organ, and before me, Carl was working with others on a design (called<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;xenharmonic moving windows&quot;).  But without biasing the current conversation<br/>&gt;&gt; with our experiences, what would you propose as a protocol for a musician<br/>&gt;&gt; with a pedalboard to allow an arbitrary modulation with an arbitrary common<br/>&gt;&gt; tone, or as Peter I think calls the same thing &quot;bridge note&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So far I have dealt with the situation in which either the common tone is<br/>&gt;&gt; either the old tonic or the new tonic, based on an arbitrary protocol in<br/>&gt;&gt; which upward and downward movements on the pedalboard select one or the<br/>&gt;&gt; other.  I have been thinking about other solutions involving using a<br/>&gt;&gt; temporary change to an intermediate key which I think allows any note to<br/>&gt;&gt; then be common, though I have not analyzed or tested this extensively.  So<br/>&gt;&gt; it requires 2 pedal key-presses per modulation in the general case.  This is<br/>&gt;&gt; awkward and interferes with performance.  It can be improved upon by various<br/>&gt;&gt; tricks, such as allowing the intermediate key to be recognized by an time<br/>&gt;&gt; overlap with the prevous pedal key and a kind of mono-mode functioning.<br/>&gt;&gt; This is probably not brilliantly clear since I am in a rush.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What you and Carl have been working on is more complex.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But just to pose the question to you again, with a specific example.  Lets<br/>&gt;&gt; say you have a 12-tone scale based on the harmonic series.  Carl gave me<br/>&gt;&gt; this one, which is quite useful, perhaps in some sense optimal:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 16:17:18:19:20:21:22:24:26:27:28:30<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And suppose you have a 3:4:5 (12:16:20) chord at G-C-E and you want the E to<br/>&gt;&gt; remain at fixed pitch as you hold the same 3 keys and you want the chord to<br/>&gt;&gt; become an 11:15:19, with the bottom 2 notes retuning to create this.  (I<br/>&gt;&gt; hope I got that right.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have tried to analyse this and can not see what your new tuning would be.<br/>&gt; Can you give a full set of ratios for your scale after modulation or tell<br/>&gt; me the<br/>&gt; new key note, please?</p><p>Yes, I gave the absolute minimum information there.</p><p>The scale before and after modulation are the same scale with the 16..30<br/>ratios shown above.  The 16 corresponds to the &quot;tonic&quot; and the tonic is<br/>shifted to a new position.  In this case the tonic is shifted one note down<br/>from C to B.  Lets measure frequencies in units contrived to make the<br/>frequency of C equal to 1 in the first chord.</p><p>Then the G-C-E 3:4:5 (or equally 12:16:20) chord is initially:</p><p>    3/4 : 1 : 5/4</p><p>and after the modulation the G-C-E chord is, because I specified that it<br/>have the ratios 11:15:19 and that the top note remain at constant pitch:</p><p>    (5/4)*(11/19) : (5/4)*(15/19) : 5/4</p><p>which makes the calculations explicit but can be simplified to</p><p>    55/76 : 75/76 : 5/4</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is not necessarily the most musically useful example, but that was too<br/>&gt;&gt; much to come up with quickly here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What protocol for pedal use would you suggest to achieve such freedom of<br/>&gt;&gt; choice while playing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know Kurt.</p><p>Well, you needn&apos;t belabor these details in any case.  I was mainly trying to<br/>demonstrate the degree of freedom in controlling the exact results of a<br/>modulation that might be useful, and maybe it will be, but if not, don&apos;t<br/>worry.</p><p>No rush on this.  Carl and I have been talking about it for 6 months or<br/>more, and until we got down and dirty with practical use of prototyped<br/>behavior on an instrument we could play, it was might harder to clarify.</p><p>So just think about modulations where you may want a certain tone in a chord<br/>before modulation to match the pitch of a certain tone in a chord after<br/>modulation.  This is most motivated if you have something you are really<br/>trying to do, musically.  In my particular case it was a desire to be able<br/>to reproduce things such as Toby Twining did (or at least what I was<br/>hearing) in Chrysalid Requium (followed by certain improvisational<br/>&quot;responses&quot; to that music) that provided additional clarity as I was<br/>approaching this problem.</p><p>Of course if the harmony is such that no common notes occur at a certain<br/>place, then things are much freer and the issue disappears.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=49842 href="#49842">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 8:11:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 12/13/03 3:53 PM, Peter Frazer &lt;<a href="mailto:paf@easynet.co.uk">paf@easynet.co.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On Sat, 13 Dec 2003 05:18:34 -0000 Peter wrote<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There&apos;s a problem in that too.

However, a composer has to indicate a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change of accidentals at a single point and the first note following<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this can be taken as the bridge note, which is usually the first<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; note of a bar.

I can only take a<br/>&gt;&gt; wild guess and answer that. In most modulations, at least two-thirds<br/>&gt;&gt; of the notes of the scale in the old key are common to the scale of<br/>&gt;&gt; the new key. E.g., in modulating from C to F:-<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; C D E F G A B ==&gt; F G A Bb C D E<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; where the bridge would *never* involve melodic motion from B to Bb to<br/>&gt;&gt; achieve the modulation. The last note of the old key is always some<br/>&gt;&gt; or other note of the new key also - and vice versa. However, that<br/>&gt;&gt; note need not be the tonic of either. In fact there can be several<br/>&gt;&gt; notes in succession which are common to both keys - extending the<br/>&gt;&gt; ambiguity. This should also apply if the modulation is achieved via a<br/>&gt;&gt; chord progression where one can talk of common chords, such as Am7 in<br/>&gt;&gt; the example, instead of common notes. Does that clarify?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not really.  If a bunch of notes don&apos;t change in JI after a modulation,<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t change, and you&apos;re done.  But if you want one that *does*<br/>&gt; change not to change, this can be done by adjusting the concert pitch<br/>&gt; of the tuning immediately after the modulation.  In this case one has<br/>&gt; to specify which not he doesn&apos;t want to change, in addition to the<br/>&gt; new tonic (if they are not the same).  Unless your program tries to do<br/>&gt; that automatically...   ?</p><p>I somewhat dislike the idea, but I am thinking of how useful it would be to<br/>be able to interpret gestures of the hands on the keys, perhaps by wearing<br/>one of those virtual-reality gloves (hopefully a *very* comfortable one)<br/>while playing.
