I&apos;m copying this to the main tuning list,<br/>where these more technical discussions are more appropriate (are<br/>you aware of it?  <a href="/tuning">/tuning</a>  ).  If<br/>you like, just reply there.</p><p>&gt;     Since this whole thing is an invention of sorts (nothing<br/>&gt;existing so far I&apos;ve found I can easily compare it how it works)<br/>&gt;there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;m going to use your and other input to<br/>&gt;develop the final docs for the code to take advantage of more<br/>&gt;well known terminologies.</p><p>Great!</p><p>&gt;On demand I may also make an optional Windows version with a<br/>&gt;complete, simple graphical interface that will in a way document<br/>&gt;itself, would you (or anyone else) find that useful?</p><p>I would, yes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The &quot;basic&quot; reason it works is it categorizes each instrument<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;part&apos;s base harmonic and overtones and retunes the overtones<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;to match a fairly flexible structure based on tonotopic theory<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;(as opposed to &quot;auto-tuning&quot;, which forces base harmonics, and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;not overtones, to match an unflexible, often emotionally<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;compromised scale).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Sounds like some form of adaptive tuning. Are you familiar with<br/>&gt;&gt;Bill Sethares&apos; stuff (music/book)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Far as I&apos;ve learned it has many similarities but is not as<br/>&gt;complex.  From what I understand Bill&apos;s work on tune, timber, and<br/>&gt;scale (huge oversimplification I know) involves re-tuning each<br/>&gt;instrument including overtones to a scale to minimize clashing<br/>&gt;overtones (or scale to instrument) that would bump up disonance<br/>&gt;between sounds so the new instrument matches the feel of the scale<br/>&gt;(with disonance only in places that make emotional sense).<br/>&gt;     My interpretation simply fits existing overtones to a<br/>&gt;frequency schema that creates a minimum overall dissonance curve<br/>&gt;between all frequencies.</p><p>Sethares is probably most famous for take a scale as given, then<br/>cooking timbres to minimize tonotopic dissonance for dyads in it<br/>(as I understand it), then composing music with the scale and<br/>timbres.  (I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s any more or less complex than what<br/>you&apos;re doing but...)  He reads this list from time to time and<br/>maybe he&apos;ll try your software and chime in.</p><p>&gt;&gt;My only concern is resynthesis errors -- or are you just pitch-<br/>&gt;&gt;shifting bands of audio or something?<br/>&gt;     It is a form of pitch-shifting only the most valid peak<br/>&gt;bands.  But everything is on a per-window basis, not constant<br/>&gt;shifts through the whole file (which would sound like a flat<br/>&gt;and garbled mess)...so nearly all the peaks are preserved.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt;really not that complex an algorithm far as DSP perceptual<br/>&gt;codec-related code goes.</p><p>Cool.  Bill has done tunes with more local effects (like<br/>Three Ears) than I described above but none using this exact<br/>approach that I know of.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And where does the binaural part come in?<br/>&gt;     Oversimplification: it lets the ear sum up parts of music<br/>&gt;together, rather than duplicating the data in the same channel<br/>&gt;nearer to another frequency thus making more dissonance.<br/>&gt;      When electronic musicians of producers pan two different<br/>&gt;notes to the far left and far right and it sounds clearer they<br/>&gt;take advantage similar properties.</p><p>So you move potentially beating peaks to different ears, yes?</p><p>Let me just go back to this for a sec:</p><p>&gt;The &quot;basic&quot; reason it works is it categorizes each instrument<br/>&gt;part&apos;s base harmonic and overtones</p><p>Do you mean *fundamental* and overtones, and if so, how do you<br/>know what&apos;s what for a polyphonic instrument like a piano?</p><p>&gt;and retunes the overtones</p><p>...but not the fundamental?</p><p>&gt;to match a fairly flexible structure based on tonotopic theory<br/>&gt;(as opposed to &quot;auto-tuning&quot;, which forces base harmonics, and<br/>&gt;not overtones, to match an unflexible, often emotionally<br/>&gt;compromised scale).</p><p>I guess I don&apos;t know how auto-tuning works -- They have to pitch<br/>shift everything, right (not just the fundamental), but then just<br/>apply a resonance at the formant peaks from the original??</p><p>&gt;The reason why recording in different tunings can work together<br/>&gt;is each peak harmonic/overtone is pushed up or down in frequency<br/>&gt;to align with the schema.  So, for example, amplitude peaks in<br/>&gt;the guitar track at 956hz and the piano track at 1023hz may both<br/>&gt;be added to produce a peak at 1010hz, the nearest point in the<br/>&gt;schema and their phases rotated accordingly to maintain most of<br/>&gt;the original track&apos;s non-noisy brightness.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to try it later today.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
