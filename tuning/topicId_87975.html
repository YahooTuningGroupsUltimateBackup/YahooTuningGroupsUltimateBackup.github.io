I forgot to ask...how would the &apos;minor&apos; form )mirror reflection) of the harmonic series sound? Chords such as the minor triad, and the half dim 7 chord?</p><p>THe equal spacing of the harmonic series would be preserved,even after being &quot;reflected in a mirror&quot;, so the minor and major chord should sound the same.  Agreed?</p><p>thanks, Kelly</p></div>
