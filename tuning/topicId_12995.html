Good to have you back. How do you like my new, harmonic-entropy<br/>evaluation of equal temperaments?</p><p>&gt;It seems likely to me that this formula for the limit of these iterated<br/>&gt;mediants (these other &quot;noble numbers&quot;) has been published elsewhere.

The<br/>&gt;whole book sounds great.

What a great book.</p><p>&gt;Thanks. I hadn&apos;t seen this before.

Would anyone prefer &quot;noble mediant&quot;?</p><p>I would -- &quot;golden mediant&quot; might make one think simply of &quot;golden section&quot;<br/>or dividng the segment into the proporion 1:Phi.</p><p>&gt;I think it&apos;s important to make it very clear that the golden mediant is<br/>&gt;being applied to two completely different musical purposes.</p><p>&gt;1. Melodic or logarithmic (fractions of an octave) (e.g. Wilson, Kornerup,<br/>&gt;Lamothe, Pepper, Stearns)</p><p>&gt;2. Harmonic or linear (interval ratios) (e.g. Schulter, Keenan)</p><p>Yup!</p><p>&gt;Could someone please explain to me the significance of golden mediants (or<br/>&gt;noble numbers) in the first application? At present, it just looks like<br/>&gt;numerology to me. Is it somehow related to Rothenberg propriety?</p><p>Yes, it is. More directly, it&apos;s related to MOS scales. Look in the archives<br/>from a few months ago, and spend more time staring at Wilson&apos;s papers.</p><p>&gt;This is a point I failed to make in Margo&apos;s and my paper. Sorry.</p><p>Where is this paper?</p></div><h3><a id=13194 href="#13194">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
