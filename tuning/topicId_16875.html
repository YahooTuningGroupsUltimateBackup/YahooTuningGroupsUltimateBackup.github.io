I do know that most<br/>Yamaha synths support tunings, as do some by Korg. The Emu Proteus series holds<br/>one user tuning (Emu samplers do not have tuning tables.) Among samplers,<br/>Ensoniq and Kurzweil support tuning tables. Roland has never had a decent tuning<br/>feature in any of its synths that I know of. Also, I remember reading that the<br/>Waldorf Microwave was tuneable.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hope this helps a bit. I recommend that you look deeply into the features of<br/>any synth that interests you, and ask very direct questions to the manufacturers<br/>about tuning features. If they realize that there are people interested in<br/>tuning, who base their purchases on the tunability of a synth, then they might<br/>spend more effort to add these features to the gear.&quot;</p><p>To which I can only add amen, we should let the manufacturers know that there<br/>are a few of us out here that will make buying decisions based on the<br/>availability of these features. Santa just got me a Yamaha SW1000XG soundcard<br/>for my PC; I believe this supports alt tunings -- sure hope so anyway! I also<br/>would appreciate any specific recomendations for a workstation type keyboard<br/>currently on the market.

You<br/>mentioned Korg. Of korg synths the best bet would be a Z1 [physical<br/>modeling synth] as it allows full midi retuning [i.e you can assign any<br/>pitch to any midi note no.] 1cent resolution.<br/>Other than the Korg there is the Microwave which has a feature for adaptive<br/>tuning [ not as advanced as it could be but it&apos;s a start] it has 1.56 cents<br/>tuning resolution which is definetly audible. Also the there is the<br/>Kurzweil synth/samplers with 1 cent resolution  [a bit pricey though]. My<br/>pick would be the new Proteus 2000 which supports the midi tuning dump and<br/>improves pitch resolution on it&apos;s predecessor [from 1.56cents to 0.39<br/>cents] and has nice sounds. What I have I think is the best if you want a<br/>sampler [ensoniq asrx [now Ensoniq Asrx pro] which has resolution of 0.39<br/>cents. All the synths I have suggested here have full midi retuning<br/>ability.</p><p>Another option are soft synths such as Reaktor or Metasynth, these things<br/>are have kick arse resolution and are as synths way more flexible than any<br/>of the above.  The only down side is you need a beefy computer to handle<br/>them.</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p><p>This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended solely for<br/>the recipient.

Brian personally sent<br/>me a lengthy disseration detailing why he thought synthesizers with only 12<br/>note per octave tuning scales should not be considered microtonal.  I<br/>responded briefly with my opinions.   I would no sooner remove the 12 note<br/>per octave category from my site than remove Lou Harrison, Wendy Carlos and<br/>Robert Rich, all of whom compose primarily or exclusively in 12 note per<br/>octave microtonal scales, from the recommended listening list.  I supply the<br/>information so the web site visitor can make a decision about what they<br/>need.  I don&apos;t try to make that decision for them, or what constitutes<br/>microtonal music.

I have had at least some success with breaking microtonal<br/>tunings into 12-toned subsets, whereas Brian views that as unusable.  I have done that by<br/>playing the music in one of those subsets, and then note-by-note prepending the MIDI messages<br/>to switch between the subsets to the MIDI event list.</p><p>Unlike Brian, I find mapping a tuning &quot;linearly&quot; across the keyboard in a manner it entirely<br/>ignores the 7+5 structure of the keyboard, and such that octave boundaries in the tuning<br/>mismatch octave boundaries in the tuning, very difficult to grasp.  That except on a guitar<br/>controller, since it has no inherent 7+5 structure.  That probably has to do with the fact<br/>that Brian is a capable keyboardist whereas I&apos;ve always played other instruments, and mostly<br/>make music with a saxophone-fingering WX-11 wind controller.</p><p>Here are my personal opinions of Brian.  Please understand that I&apos;m not saying the following<br/>to malign Brian.  I&apos;m saying them as my own personal observations in hopes of helping you<br/>folks understand him and work with him.</p><p>  1. Above all else, he&apos;s a real doer;  he gets a lot of microtonal music done.<br/>  2. He does that music, and most everything else it seems, on his own terms.<br/>  3. If you disagree with his terms, he&apos;ll give you the impression (accurate or not is hard to<br/>     say) that he thinks you&apos;re incompetent.  In most cases though - most cases - he doesn&apos;t<br/>     hold a grudge against most such people, despite possible appearances to the contrary.<br/>  4. In perhaps the understatement of the century, Chris Chapman told me that Brian &quot;has a way<br/>     with words.&quot;  He has very clever and amusing ways of describing many things, although<br/>     sometimes a bit cynically.  In criticizing people to their faces though, he usually -<br/>     again usually - doesn&apos;t use a cynical tone, although it may seem like it.  Instead he<br/>     uses what he perceives to be &quot;just the facts, ma&apos;am&quot; - brutal honesty, so to speak.</p><p>As an example of the latter, I recently sent him a CD of a test of how well Ray Gun would<br/>eliminate noise from a record.  I appropriately chose a record that had a lot of recording<br/>hiss and pops in it, and he mistook that hiss for being in my studio&apos;s mixer.  I would have<br/>said something like, &quot;this is odd:  I hear a lot of hiss in this recording, and I can&apos;t seem<br/>to find anything in my system that would account for it;  could something perhaps be<br/>misadjusted in your mixer?&quot;.  He instead said &quot;your mixer has a lot of noise.&quot;  (For the<br/>record, that may not be an exact quote, but it&apos;s close.)  Is that an insult?  Did he say that<br/>in an attempt to upset me?  No.  It&apos;s a candy-coating-free statement of what he perceived, in<br/>this case incorrectly but not aways, to be fact.  Would it have upset me if I didn&apos;t know him<br/>better?  Probably.</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MR88CET@TEXAS.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2001 10:17:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll also point out that, even though I quoted Brian, I gave that<br/>&gt; quote as an expert opinion</p><p>Notice also that I said &quot;an expert&quot; opinion, not &quot;the one and only<br/>expert&quot; opinion.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2001 12:20:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
