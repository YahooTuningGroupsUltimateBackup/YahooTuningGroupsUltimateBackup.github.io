If you record the<br/>air pressure in the air (i.e. using a microphone) and trace the curve,<br/>you will clearly see the beating.</p><p>The formula shows that the enveloppe frequency is (F1-F2)/2 and does<br/>depends only on the difference, not absolute values of F1 and F2.</p><p>The inner ear &quot;usually&quot; select the left form (because the cochlea<br/>works as Fourier transform machine that decompose the sound as sum of<br/>sin of different frequencies). When F1 and F2 are so close that they<br/>cannot be resolved as separate frequencies, the right form is<br/>selected. That is why there no such thing as 150Hz beating is normally<br/>perceived.</p><p>The perception of beat in this simple context does not involve any<br/>non-linear phenomena.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;electricwally77 &lt;earth7@o...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;earth7@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi fellow tuners<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m studying Doty&apos;s great book called The JI Primer and have a<br/>&gt; question on Frequency Beats.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On page 11 he writes...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The beat frequency (fB), is the difference between the two<br/>component<br/>&gt; frequencies (f2-f1).

For tyhose who say this only exist in ones hear, one has only to turn down the treble on your stereo and these pitches will not dimish as the uppers tone generators do.<br/> one does not need all these long forulas to say that the differenace between tewo pitch will generate a differance tone that due to various circumstances can be heard.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Walter,<br/>&gt; What I believe everyone is getting at, but hasn&apos;t said directly, is<br/>&gt; that your math in your example is correct, but this phenomenon is<br/>&gt; clearly audible only in tones very close to one another. So a better<br/>&gt; example would be two frequencies 500 &amp; 505, producing a beat frequency<br/>&gt; of 5 beats per second.<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t be frustrated...it took me three reads to understand it all well<br/>&gt; enough to get into 7 limit and I still don&apos;t get it all!<br/>&gt; Peace,<br/>&gt; Chester<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;electricwally77 &lt;earth7@o...&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;earth7@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi fellow tuners<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m studying Doty&apos;s great book called The JI Primer and have a<br/>&gt; &gt; question on Frequency Beats.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On page 11 he writes...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;The beat frequency (fB), is the difference between the two<br/>&gt; component<br/>&gt; &gt; frequencies (f2-f1).
