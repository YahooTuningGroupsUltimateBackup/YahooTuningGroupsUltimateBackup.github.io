There<br/>&gt; was a beautiful 31-tone Harmoniehammerfluegel built by Johann Jakob<br/>&gt; K&quot;onnicke in Vienna and finished in July 1796. It has 6 rows of<br/>&gt; 37 white keys and a range of F1-g&apos;&apos;&apos;. The keys of the C<br/>&gt; columns have a large dot on it and the keys of the F and G columns<br/>three small<br/>&gt; dots. The layout of the five upper rows is as follows:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fx   Gx   Ax   Bx   Cx   Dx   Ex   Fx   Gx   Ax  ...<br/>&gt; F#   G#   A#   B#   C#   D#   E#   F#   G#   A#  ...<br/>&gt; F    G    A    B    C    D    E    F    G    A   ...<br/>&gt; Fb   Gb   Ab   Bb   Cb   Db   Eb   Fb   Gb   Ab  ...<br/>&gt; Fbb  Gbb  Abb  Bbb  Cbb  Dbb  Ebb  Fbb  Gbb  Abb ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The keys of the bottom row are coupled to other keys. This layout<br/>&gt; enables an easy shift by a chromatic semitone of 77.4 cents by<br/>&gt; changing a row.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beethoven and Haydn have played on this piano, which was tuned in 31<br/>tET.<br/>&gt; K&quot;onnicke built it with instructions of the Domkapellmeister of Linz,<br/>&gt; Johann Georg<br/>&gt; Roser who had ordered a similar instrument in Brussels ten years<br/>earlier for<br/>&gt; Mozart. Roser had several meetings in Linz with Mozart, who allegedly<br/>composed<br/>&gt; two little pieces for the instrument (according to the manuscript of<br/>Roser&apos;s<br/>&gt; biography), and which were regrettably lost.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This Harmoniehammerfluegel shows the importance meantone temperament<br/>still<br/>&gt; had at the end of the 18th century in Vienna. According to Herbert<br/>&gt; Kelletat had<br/>&gt; Mozart meantone temperament in consideration when he chose the keys<br/>for his<br/>&gt; keyboard compositions. Kelletat analysed 230 compositions with<br/>&gt; employment of a<br/>&gt; keyboard instrument or organ and found that more than 80% is in C, G,<br/>D,<br/>&gt; F, A and<br/>&gt; B flat major, exactly the same keys that have pure thirds in meantone<br/>temperament.<br/>&gt; E flat and E major are exceptions and B major is absent. Moreover in<br/>45<br/>&gt; symphonies Mozart used only 8 different main keys among which only a<br/>few<br/>&gt; minor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; Reference: Herbert Kelletat: Zur musikalischen Temperatur, Teil II,<br/>&quot;Wiener<br/>&gt; Klassik&quot;.
