These scales have not<br/>&gt; &gt;been successfully described by anyone. Since they are tuned by ear it<br/>&gt; &gt;seems reasonable (but not conclusive) that there is some sort of<br/>&gt; &gt;acoustical phenomenon going on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bill Sethares has done a lot of research on Indonesian scales, which you<br/>&gt; can read about in his book, &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot;.  He<br/>&gt; relates the tunings used in Indonesian gamelans to minima in dissonance<br/>&gt; curves calculated from the instrument&apos;s non-integer partials.  If I<br/>&gt; remember correctly, he also gives examples of Indonesian tunings based<br/>&gt; on the minima in dissonance curves formed from the combination of<br/>&gt; non-integer partials from the gamelan instruments and integer partials<br/>&gt; (harmonics) from other instruments such as bowed stringed instruments<br/>&gt; that accompany the gamelan instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can read a little about his book at the following webpage:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bill&apos;s homepage is:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have read &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot; and recommend it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Christopher<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!

For instance that one can find<br/>the same or very similar family of scales in  West Africa on balophones<br/>points to these scales having another source besides timbre. Burmese harp<br/>music is another example of a different type of Pelog occurring independent<br/>of timbre. The variety of interval sizes in these scales is so wide, one<br/>could find examples to illustrate the whole gambit of JI to ET. Also how<br/>would the same timbre be the source for two completely different scales,<br/>Slendro and Pelog? To be conclusive it would have to explain these<br/>&quot;variations&quot; as well as being able to construct unique pelogs on one own<br/>using his theory. One the other hand, if one looks at the &quot;simultaneous&quot;<br/>tunings found within a Gagaku orchestra, I would tend to lean towards<br/>Bill&apos;s theories as a very probable influence. In my own experience, i have<br/>found that timbre can greatly change the perception of a scale to being<br/>almost unrecognizable  His work brings up these important questions They<br/>need to be answered and he has laid the ground work for it!</p><p>&quot;Christopher J.

I&apos;d add that one of the most arbitrary features of<br/>Sethares&apos; theory is that he looks at the intervals of minimum beating<br/>between one inharmonic and one harmonic instrument, and ignores the<br/>interactions between two or more inharmonic instruments, let alone the large<br/>variations in the timbre of these instruments and the fact that the<br/>Indonesians actually _like_ beating! I do think timbre plays a role in<br/>shaping tuning but not exactly in the way Sethares cooks up.</p></div>
