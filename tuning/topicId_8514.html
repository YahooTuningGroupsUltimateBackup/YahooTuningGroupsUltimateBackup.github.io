The only opportunity to earn a grade in the class was a<br/>one-question aural &quot;exam&quot; at the end of the semester. (Yes, I did get an<br/>&quot;A.&quot; But only because I happened to get a question I knew something about.)<br/>I hope his research skills were better than his teaching skills.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most students, of course, have this book as a reference, and it is<br/>&gt; certainly a handy compendium...  It struck me, however, that practically<br/>&gt; NONE of the pieces in Volume I, which contains Oriental, Medieval and<br/>&gt; Renaissance music, would be in the tuning system implied by the notation:<br/>&gt; 12-tET.</p><p>Unfortunately, Capitol Records did not have a branch office in any of the<br/>ancient centers of musical art. And casting ancient tunes into a &quot;best<br/>guess&quot; notation that was developed for later musical styles is not a<br/>particularly solid foundation on which to assume any particular tunings.</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth.</p><p>Jerry.</p></div>
