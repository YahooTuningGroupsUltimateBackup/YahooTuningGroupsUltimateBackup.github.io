It sounds to me like it&apos;s slowing down as it goes, trippy.<br/>There is a point about two-thirds of the way through where it is more<br/>consonant. It would be interesting to check if that&apos;s where 1000 cents<br/>and 400 cents are split by a pure 6/5 and a more or less perfect<br/>Noble low minor third. It also not impossible that that is the point<br/>it sounds most consonant to me is only because of familiarity with<br/>that chord. (noble dark third + 6/5 = 600 cents). That would make all<br/>intervals familiar: 400 c., 6/5, Noble m3, encased in 1000 c.<br/>familiar from 12-tET and maybe even a &quot;metastable&quot; interval as well.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=77527 href="#77527">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2008 1:40:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; They _can_ have a big impact in specific conditions, and<br/>&gt; &gt; yes I&apos;d love to hear an audio example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay.

Did you intend<br/>the left channel to be much louder than the right?<br/>Through headphones I hear a beat that slows and stops,<br/>presumably due to critical band effects between combination<br/>tones and original tones.  When I play the left channel only<br/>at low volume through a single speaker, the beating is<br/>almost inaudible, even at the beginning of the file.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
