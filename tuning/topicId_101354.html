It&apos;s also been noted that a<br/>scale&apos;s &quot;learnability&quot; is not necessarily correlated with its tuning<br/>accuracy. So independent of any particular measures of tuning, I pose<br/>this question to everyone: at what value of L/s will an MOS sound<br/>&quot;most unequal?&quot;</p><p>Or, in other words, at what value will the specific interval classes<br/>seem to have the most categorical independence?</p><p>1/1 is the opposite of what we want by definition, but if you go in<br/>the other direction towards infinity/1, that actually just brings you<br/>to another equal temperament with a step size of 0.</p><p>I think that the most possible unequal arrangement should work out to<br/>be L/s = phi, yes? This also, not so coincidentally, has the following<br/>properties<br/>1) your MOS and all of its chromatic, enharmonic, etc descendents will<br/>be strictly proper<br/>2) One implication of this is that &quot;sharps&quot; will be lower than &quot;flats&quot;<br/>for your chromatic scale (as with 19-equal vs 17-equal) (e.g. c &lt; s)<br/>3) Thus chromatic harmony will lay out in extremely &quot;comprehensible&quot;<br/>fashion, which can serve as nice &quot;training wheels&quot; for someone first<br/>learning chromatic harmony for a temperament</p><p>After experimenting with mavila in 25-equal vs 23-equal, and<br/>&quot;porcupine&quot; in 23-equal vs 22-equal, I have to say that this is<br/>exactly how it works for me, and furthermore that once I get the hang<br/>of the chromatic structure, it then carries over to other improper<br/>tunings, kind of like how I can hear meantone in everything.</p><p>For example, in 25-equal, using Armodue notation, the progression<br/>1-2-7b -&gt; 1-3b-5 is a contracting tritone resolving to a 0-240-673<br/>&quot;subminor&quot; chord. In 23-equal, it resolves to a 0-209-678 chord.<br/>Before spending time in 25-equal, this always sounded like I was<br/>moving by microtonal inflections to a &quot;sus2&quot; chord. After spending<br/>time in 25-equal, it now sounds like I&apos;m moving to a really, really<br/>flat &quot;subminor&quot; chord. I can snap 0-209-678 into a &quot;subminor&quot;<br/>perception now, or perhaps what I&apos;m really snapping it into is my<br/>newly formed 0-3b-6 perception, except I think what&apos;s going on is that<br/>strong and independent categories make for ease of association with<br/>chord qualities...</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101366 href="#101366">ðŸ”—</a>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2011 2:02:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ... at what value of L/s will an MOS sound &quot;most unequal?&quot;<br/>&gt; ... 1/1 is the opposite of what we want by definition, but if you go in the other direction towards infinity/1, that actually just brings you to another equal temperament with a step size of 0.<br/>&gt; ...

I&apos;ve<br/>since come to realize that porcupine[7] in 22-equal has always bugged<br/>me mostly because of little things that boil down to it having a L/s =<br/>4/3 ratio - the diminished fifths and perfect fifths sound similar in<br/>size, the 10/9&apos;s and 9/8&apos;s as well, etc. Porcupine[8] has always<br/>bothered me as well because the ~55 cent small step sounds as though<br/>it might be an intonational inflection and not an actual change in<br/>interval class. After switching to porcupine/opossum/whatever in<br/>23-equal, I realized I liked it -way- better, because although the<br/>intonational accuracy wasn&apos;t as good as 22, it didn&apos;t sound mostly<br/>like 7-equal anymore.</p><p>I then realized what exactly had happened - I was saying that<br/>diminished fifths and perfect fifths sounded too similar, that 10/9<br/>and 9/8 sounded too similar, that the small step in porcupine[8]<br/>sounded like an intonational shift in unison. Or, in other words, I<br/>was saying that from a porcupine[7] perspective, the specific interval<br/>categories in every generic interval class were getting confused,<br/>meaning that in porcupine[7], c=L-s was too small. And, in fact, L/s<br/>is 4/3 in 22-equal, which makes it about as confusing as flattone is<br/>in 26-equal. From a porcupine[8] perspective I was saying that the<br/>small step was too small to sound like a new interval and sounded like<br/>a shift in another interval.</p><p>So if porcupine[7] being L/s = 4/3 sounds too much like 7-equal... and<br/>porcupine[8] with L/s = 3/1 sounds too much like 7-equal too... then<br/>what generator would make porcupine[7] and porcupine[8] both sound<br/>maximally far from 7-equal, and hence maximally stable? I assumed phi<br/>would do the trick, but perhaps there&apos;s no one size fits all solution<br/>- L/s = 3/1 works wonders for the diatonic scale, I notice, but<br/>doesn&apos;t do so well for porcupine[8]...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101383 href="#101383">ðŸ”—</a>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2011 2:05:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; this question to everyone: at what value of L/s will an MOS sound<br/>&gt; &quot;most unequal?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or, in other words, at what value will the specific interval classes<br/>&gt; seem to have the most categorical independence?</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking about very similar things lately!

Do you feel like the intervals are more independent now and<br/>less ambiguous, despite their relative lack of intonational purity?<br/>Also note that the small step in porcupine[8] is now a 95-cent leading<br/>tone, does that make any difference?</p><p>I hear it that way and got some consensus on this when I asked in the<br/>XA chat. To me, when you compare it to 23-equal, the 22-equal version<br/>sounds kinda like flattone does in 26-equal when you compare it to<br/>something like 31-equal - uncomfortably compressed and slightly<br/>ambiguous. However, in this case, the ambiguity is related to the<br/>tuning with greater harmonic purity, not the other way around. When<br/>you play the rest of the scale, it sounds like the fifth actually<br/>should be rather sharp - much like I thought that 7/4 was flat the<br/>first time I listened to JI after coming into it from 12-equal. You<br/>can mess with gorgo in 16-equal and note that in the context of that<br/>scale, the 750 cent interval sounds more like &quot;a 3/2,&quot; which may<br/>really mean something deeper and more subtly than an actual 3/2, than<br/>the 675 cent interval does.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101406 href="#101406">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2011 10:07:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Aug 26, 2011 at 12:52 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hear it that way and got some consensus on this when I asked in the<br/>&gt; XA chat.

But the TOP Pajara<br/>&gt; Pentachordal Decatonic problem suggests there&apos;s more to optimal<br/>&gt; tuning than just making the consonances as consonant as possible.

In general, I think that every one of those expressions except<br/>for &quot;s&quot; is going to equal c for any MOS, so what you&apos;re basically<br/>saying is that scales in which s=c will be easiest to learn, despite<br/>that they&apos;re only Rothenberg proper and not strictly proper.

Although that wasn&apos;t the main point of this example.</p><p>Here&apos;s the gist of it - when I arpeggiate C-E-G-C-E-G-etc, no F0<br/>estimation takes place unless I play those notes within a few hundred<br/>milliseconds of one another. Nonetheless, the chord still seems to<br/>retain the same &quot;quality&quot; as when I play the notes together. An<br/>arpeggiated C-E-G-C-E-G-C-E-G will seem to be more consonant than an<br/>arpeggiated C-Eb-Gb-A-C-Eb-Gb-A-C. This is good, because it allows us<br/>to hear triadic harmony in something like a Bach 2-part invention. If<br/>this didn&apos;t happen, Bach&apos;s Invention no 8 would sound no different<br/>than an atonal composition consisting of random 12-equal dyads.</p><p>My hypothesis is that this is something that&apos;s learned, something<br/>that&apos;s tuning-specific, and that will fail when someone listens to a<br/>new tuning or a new scale that they&apos;re completely unused to - that<br/>this process will &quot;misfire&quot; in characteristic ways as we reify in the<br/>wrong harmonic data.</p><p>So the question is, relative to your categorical perception - if you<br/>believe, with the best of your knowledge, that the root, third, and<br/>fifth of this scale, when played at the same time, ---would--- sound<br/>like what you&apos;d categorically call a &quot;major chord.&quot; This is as opposed<br/>to something you&apos;d categorically call a &quot;minor chord&quot; or an &quot;augmented<br/>chord&quot; or a &quot;diminished chord.&quot; If you have categories that you&apos;ve<br/>assigned numerical labels to, such as &quot;4:5:6&quot; or &quot;5:6:7,&quot; as I suspect<br/>most people on here do, then you can use those as well. I&apos;m trying to<br/>figure out how you&apos;d harmonically reason through the scale fragment I<br/>played.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101424 href="#101424">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2011 7:34:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Aug 26, 2011 at 10:33 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Fri, Aug 26, 2011 at 1:55 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we&apos;re to apply</p><p>Cool, thanks, Ctrl-X.

But it turns out to agree with what I<br/>&gt; came up with originally, just thinking generally. So that&apos;s<br/>&gt; reassuring (to me).</p><p>Yes, it is, but my train of thought was -<br/>- The haplotonic scale has the lowest range at L/s = 3/2.<br/>- Once you understand the haplotonic scale, you&apos;ll want to get your<br/>head wrapped around the albitonic scale next.<br/>- If the haplotonic scale is set to L/s = 3/2, then the albitonic<br/>scale is 2/1, which isn&apos;t optimal. So say you set that to 3/2 instead.<br/>OK.<br/>- Once you understand the albitonic scale, you&apos;ll want to get your<br/>head wrapped around the chromatic scale next.<br/>- If the albitonic scale is set to L/s = 3/2, then the chromatic scale<br/>is set to 2/1, which isn&apos;t optimal. So say you set that to 3/2<br/>instead. OK</p><p>And so on. So I was saying that the L/s value that will minimize the<br/>range for all of the meta-intervals, and the meta-meta intervals, and<br/>the meta-meta-meta-meta intervals all the way down the chain ad<br/>infinitum, was phi.</p><p>Obviously you don&apos;t need to go down that far, probably no further than<br/>the chromatic or perhaps enharmonic level, but the situation does get<br/>cloudy when you have a scale which has two useful MOS&apos;s right next to<br/>each other, like porcupine or mohajira.</p><p>For example, the optimal range for porcupine[7] implies 15-equal,<br/>whereas the optimal range for porcupine[8] implies 23-equal. Which one<br/>is better for porcupine temperament in general? How about mohajira[7]<br/>vs mohajira[10]? Probably both, and setting L/s = phi sets, in a<br/>certain sense, a maximally easy to learn structure all the way up and<br/>down the entire MOS chain and temperament at large, at least as far as<br/>range and propriety are both concerned.</p><p>OK, how important are range and propriety? I have no idea, but if<br/>you&apos;ve noted my continued posts about mavila and porcupine recently,<br/>there&apos;s something around the vicinity of these ideas that has<br/>immediate and apparent importance to my ear. 25-equal mavila and<br/>23-equal porcupine are so refreshingly &quot;clear&quot; to my mind that in<br/>retrospect it&apos;s obvious why I hated porcupine in 22-equal so much, and<br/>why this seems to be such a common reaction - it sounds like it might<br/>as well be 7-equal. It&apos;s like getting used to meantone by listening to<br/>26-equal.</p><p>But at any rate, Kalle&apos;s construct seems to be giving some interesting<br/>results, in that he seems to be doing the same thing you are, but<br/>getting L/s = 3/1 for meantone as optimal. So I&apos;m not sure how he&apos;s<br/>tweaked it compared to you, but I do note that I find the diatonic<br/>scale in 17-equal to be more comprehensible than the one in 19-equal.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m trying to figure out how you&apos;d harmonically reason<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the scale fragment I played.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wish I knew.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you saying that you can&apos;t figure out what the quality<br/>&gt; &gt; of the tonic triad is?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Honestly, I have no idea what you&apos;re asking me. :(</p><p>OK, here&apos;s another example (apologies for the poor sound quality)</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/not-flat-major-scale">http://soundcloud.com/mikebattagliamusic/not-flat-major-scale</a></p><p>This one is also LLsL.</p><p>Does it sound like the root, third, and fifth, if played together,<br/>would make a different fundamental type of chord than the root, third,<br/>and fifth of the other example, or just a differently intoned version<br/>of the same chord?<br/>And do you feel that in the other example would make a different<br/>fundamental type of chord than the root, third, and fifth of the<br/>diatonic scale in 12-equal, or just a differently intoned version of<br/>the same chord?</p><p>I&apos;m just asking for your initial impression.
