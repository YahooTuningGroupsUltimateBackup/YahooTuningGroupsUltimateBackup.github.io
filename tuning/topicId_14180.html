Readers so inclined are invited<br/>to turn directly to the matters of optimizations and comparisons<br/>addressed in Section 2.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. The Four Convivial Ratios: psychoacoustical interpretations<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>From one point of view, the choice of a set of ratios for regular and<br/>alternative thirds such as 14:11, 13:11, 21:17, and 17:14 could be<br/>seen as simply another arbitrary musical fashion. The use of large<br/>integer ratios might be seen as a variation on the impressively large<br/>ratios of medieval Pythagorean tuning, with large _primes_ as an<br/>influence of 20th-century practice and theory from Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger and Harry Partch to Ervin Wilson and LaMonte Young.</p><p>However, this still leaves the question: why _these_ specific ratios<br/>as an intonational ideal for an esteemed variety of neo-Gothic regular<br/>temperament?</p><p>Here there may be two psychoacoustical explanations, both of which may<br/>be related not so much to the precise sizes of the four ratios as to<br/>their general location on the continuum of intervals. Both of these<br/>explanations may fit the general theme of &quot;measured complexity.&quot;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.1. Regular thirds: Poised between Pythagorean and 17-tET<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Any inquiry into the tuning of major and minor thirds in neo-Gothic<br/>music might begin with the role of these intervals in Gothic styles of<br/>the 13th and 14th centuries in Western Europe based on Pythagorean<br/>tuning with pure fifths and fourths.</p><p>In this Gothic tradition, the major third or ditone (81:64, ~407.820<br/>cents) and minor third or semiditone (32:27, ~294.135 cents) are often<br/>described as &quot;imperfect concords,&quot; at once unstable and yet<br/>_relatively_ blending. The rather complex Pythagorean ratios for these<br/>intervals nicely fit their musical role, and Pythagorean tunings for<br/>Gothic or neo-Gothic music are ideal in a wide variety of timbres.</p><p>As we increasingly temper the fifth in the wide direction, however,<br/>the tension as well as complexity of these intervals gradually<br/>increases to a point where their fit to a Gothic or conventional<br/>neo-Gothic musical style can become problematic in many timbres.</p><p>By the point we reach 17-tone equal temperament or 17-tET (fifths at<br/>~705.882 cents, ~3.927 cents wide), some rather careful choices of<br/>timbre of the kind used by Ivor Darreg[2] and developed in practice<br/>and theory by William Sethares[3] may be required in a neo-Gothic<br/>setting.</p><p>At a size of ~423.529 cents, not far from 23:18 (~424.364 cents), the<br/>relatively blending major thirds of Gothic and conventional neo-Gothic<br/>styles may actually be heard as somewhat more tense or &quot;dissonant&quot;<br/>than the relatively tense although somewhat &quot;compatible&quot; major<br/>seconds. However, with Setharean timbral adjustments to mitigate the<br/>tension between partials, these 17-tET thirds can have a very<br/>stylistically apt quality of being at once relatively &quot;concordant&quot; but<br/>unstable.</p><p>Since I took note of this quality of 17-tET in a paper on neo-Gothic<br/>temperaments[4], David Keenan has offered a mathematical application<br/>of a Phi-based mediant or &quot;Noble Mediant&quot; to certain interval ratios<br/>in order to estimate the point of &quot;equal gravitation&quot; and maximal<br/>complexity between two simpler ratios.[5] Note that this application<br/>of Phi to integer ratios of intervals should not be confused with its<br/>application to logarithmic fractions of the octave in scale<br/>generation, as happens in Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning.</p><p>Applying Dave Keenan&apos;s formula to find the region of maximal<br/>complexity between the simpler ratios for major thirds of 4:5 and 7:9,<br/>we find that it is indeed very close to 17-tET:</p><p>                                5 + 9 Phi<br/>      NobleMediant (4:5, 7:9) = --------- = ~422.487 cents<br/>                                4 + 7 Phi</p><p>Whether from a viewpoint of pragmatic experience with tunings and<br/>timbres, or from the mathematical model of Dave Keenan&apos;s &quot;Noble<br/>Mediant of complexity,&quot; we have a continuum of tension in the central<br/>neo-Gothic region from Pythagorean to 17-tET. In Pythagorean tuning,<br/>major thirds seem to fit the &quot;relatively blending but unstable&quot; ideal<br/>over a wide range of timbres; by 17-tET, rather delicate timbral<br/>adjustments may be in order to maintain the stylistic nuances of<br/>&quot;concord/discord.&quot;</p><p>Intuitively, the middle portion of this spectrum somewhere around<br/>29-tET (fifths ~703.448 cents, ~1.493 cents wide) or 46-tET (fifths<br/>~704.348 cents, ~2.393 cents wide) might be expected to have musical<br/>qualities differing somewhat from Pythagorean and yet &quot;milder&quot; or<br/>&quot;gentler&quot; than 17-tET, and stylistically fitting over a somewhat wider<br/>variety of timbres.[6]</p><p>While this pragmatic or &quot;Aristoxenian&quot; explanation for the musical<br/>appeal of the region by no means excludes other approaches including<br/>the exploration of mediant and related relationships between large<br/>integer ratios, it provides a ready aesthetic orientation to this<br/>portion of the neo-Gothic spectrum.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>1.1.1. A heraldry of ratios: gradient intermediates<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>Along this engaging continuum of the central &quot;neo-Gothic plateau&quot;<br/>between 5:4 and 9:7, large integer ratios serve as intellectually and<br/>heraldically engaging placenames for subtle gradients of musical<br/>color. The ratio of 14:11, for example, represents the Classic Mediant<br/>between 5:4 and 9:7, (5+9):(4+7).</p><p>Likewise, the ratio of 13:11 for regular minor thirds represents the<br/>Classic Mediant of 6:5 and 7:6, or (6+7):(5+6). Thus the ratio is<br/>regarded as esteemed, but not as uniquely privileged: 32:27, 33:28, or<br/>20:17 might have equally precious musical qualities in the neo-Gothic<br/>realm.</p><p>The same kind of heraldry can apply to irrational ratios also, for<br/>example the 29-tET major third at 10/29 octave or ~413.793 cents. As<br/>it happens, this interval is almost identical to 127:100 (~413.794<br/>cents).</p><p>A numerical &quot;lineage&quot; for this ratio derives it as a weighted<br/>intermediate between the Pythagorean 81:64 and 23:18, the former<br/>representing classic Gothic balance and the latter an interval near<br/>the region of maximal complexity. Here the weighting is y/x=2/1 on the<br/>side of 23:18, an interval itself derivable as an intermediate of 5:4<br/>and 9:7 with the same weighting of y/x=2/1:</p><p>                                        81 + 23 * 2   81 + 46   127<br/>  GradientIntermediate (81:64, 23:18) = ----------- = ------- = ---<br/>                                        64 + 18 * 2   64 + 36   100</p><p>Here it should be emphasized that this taking of mediants or<br/>intermediates between already complex ratios is quite different from<br/>the finding of Classic or Noble Mediants between intervals with simple<br/>ratios tuneable by a &quot;locking in&quot; of partials. While the term<br/>&quot;Heraldic Intermediate&quot; may nicely communicate the neo-medieval<br/>qualities of this approach, the term &quot;Gradient Intermediate&quot; may more<br/>specifically convey the idea -- and ideal -- of seeking fine<br/>intonational shadings between other complex shadings.</p><p>While the idea of a region of the plateau intermediate in &quot;complexity&quot;<br/>or &quot;tension&quot; between Pythagorean and 17-tET can explain the attraction<br/>of ratios such as 14:11 and 13:11, the special charm of this region<br/>becomes clearer when we consider also the &quot;alternative thirds,&quot;<br/>augmented seconds and diminished fourth.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>1.2. Active polarity: Between simplicity and neutrality<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As is well known, in a medieval Pythagorean tuning diminished fourths<br/>(eight fifths down) at 8192:6561 (~384.360 cents) and augmented<br/>seconds (nine fifths up) at 19683;16384 (~317.595 cents) have ratios<br/>almost identical to a pure 5:4 (~386.314 cents) and 6:5 (~315.641<br/>cents), differing by only a schisma of 32805:32768 (~1.954 cents).<br/>While these intervals occur incidentally in some conventional<br/>14th-century music, they play an important role in the changing<br/>musical and intonational styles during the era of roughly 1400-1450,<br/>possibly starting somewhat earlier in certain localities such as late<br/>14th-century Florence, for example.</p><p>In contrast, as we temper fifths more and more in the wide direction,<br/>17-tET marks the point at which shrinking diminished fourths and<br/>expanding augmented seconds momentarily converge into a single size of<br/>&quot;neutral third&quot; at 5/17 octave, or ~352.941 cents, quite close to 11:9<br/>(~347.408 cents).</p><p>About midway between these two conditions, we find a region from<br/>around 29-tET to slightly beyond 46-tET where these &quot;alternative<br/>thirds&quot; are at once active and yet somewhat &quot;polarized,&quot; with the<br/>diminished fourth as a kind of &quot;submajor third,&quot; and the augmented<br/>second as a &quot;supraminor third.&quot; Or, if we prefer medieval terms, we<br/>might describe these intervals as &quot;subditonal&quot; and &quot;suprasemiditonal.&quot;</p><p>Along with regular thirds at or close to 14:11 and 13:11, these<br/>&quot;convivial&quot; submajor and supraminor thirds at or near 21:17 (~365.825<br/>cents) and 17:14 (~336.130 cents) contribute to the region&apos;s<br/>distinctive musical charm.</p><p>Unlike the smooth Pythagorean schisma thirds -- a beguiling feature of<br/>early 15th-century music -- these alternative thirds have a quality at<br/>once active, and also somewhat &quot;polarized&quot; in comparison to the<br/>neutral thirds of 17-tET.</p><p>From a systemic point of view, these thirds have a kinship to their<br/>regular counterparts at or near 14:11 and 13:11; they have an active<br/>and &quot;passionate&quot; quality inviting compelling cadential resolutions.<br/>Thus 21:17 and 17:14 might be considered &quot;convivial&quot; to these regular<br/>thirds in stylistic terms, as well as in sharing the same portion of<br/>the neo-Gothic spectrum.[7]</p><p>To sum up, the &quot;Four Convivial Ratios&quot; may represent a two-dimensional<br/>concept of &quot;poised and measured complexity&quot; between Pythagorean and<br/>17-tET:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Tuning            Regular thirds           Alternative thirds<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Pythagorean       Relatively complex       Smooth and &quot;simple&quot;<br/>                  (81:64; 32:27)           (~5:4; ~6:5)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>29-tET to 46-tET  Somewhat more complex    Active submajor/supraminor<br/>                  (~14:11, ~13:11)         (~21:17, ~17:14)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>17-tET            Near-maximally complex   Single neutral size<br/>                  (~23:18, ~20:17)         (~11:9)<br/>=====================================================================</p><p>This discussion may have placed the &quot;Four Convivial Ratios&quot; in some<br/>musical context. As may have already appeared, these ratios are by no<br/>means exclusively favored in neo-Gothic music (covering a spectrum<br/>ranging from Pythagorean to 22-tET or 27-tET), or even regarded<br/>categorically as &quot;first among equals,&quot; but rather as &quot;esteemed among<br/>equals.&quot;</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Optimization Choices: Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning and some neighbors<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Having placed the Four Convivial Ratios in some musical perspective,<br/>we can approach the problem of their optimization in regular<br/>temperaments. Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning nicely exemplifies a rough point<br/>of balance between the four ratios, while other temperaments represent<br/>various nuances of compromise leaning in one direction or another.</p><p>One way of getting an overview of the possibilities is a spectrum<br/>chart for the range of temperaments with fifth sizes between 703.4<br/>cents (just below 29-tET) to 704.7 cents (a bit beyond 46-tET or a<br/>tuning with major thirds at precisely 14:11).</p><p>The top number line of the chart shows the spectrum of fifth sizes,<br/>with eight tunings indicated: the tunings making each of the four<br/>ratios &quot;pure&quot; (if this term can be applied to complex ratios); 29-tET<br/>and 46-tET; Kennan Pepper&apos;s tuning (KP); and an &quot;e-based&quot; tuning (E)<br/>in which the ratio of whole-tone to diatonic semitone or limma is<br/>equal to Euler&apos;s _e_, ~2.71828182845904523536029.</p><p>An accompanying number line shows the tempering of fifths in the wide<br/>direction from a pure 3:2, with the lines below showing sizes for the<br/>four varieties of regular and &quot;alternative&quot; thirds and variances from<br/>the respective ratios of 14:11, 13:11, 21:17, and 17:14, with the<br/>locations of these ratios indicated by an asterisk (*) on a number<br/>line:</p><p>                               17:14             14:11<br/>    29    13:11                     KP     21:17 46           E<br/>  |----|----*----|----|----|----|*---|----|---*|---*|----|----|----|<br/>703.4 .5   .6   .7   .8   .9  704.0 .1   .2   .3   .4   .5   .6   .7<br/>                Fifth size and tempering (3:2 = ~701.955)<br/>     |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|--<br/>   +1.5  1.6  1.7  1.8  1.9  2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3  2.4  2.5  2.6  2.7<br/>                   Major third (14:11 = ~417.508)<br/>-3.9  3.5  3.1  2.7  2.3  1.9  1.5  1.1  .7   .3   +.1  .5   .9   1.3<br/>  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---*|----|----|----|<br/>413.6 414  .4   .8  415.2 .6  416.0 .4   .8  417.2 .6  418.0 .4   .8<br/>                   Minor third (13:11 = ~289.210)<br/> +.6  .3    0  -.3   .6   .9  -1.2  1.5  1.8 -2.1  2.4  2.7 -3.0  3.3<br/>  |----|----*----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|<br/>289.8 .5   .2  288.9 .6   .3   .0 287.7  .4   .1  286.8 .5   .2  285.9<br/>                Diminished fourth (21:17 = ~365.825)<br/>+7.0  6.2  5.4  4.6  3.8  3.0  2.2  1.4  0.6 -0.2 -1.0  1.8 -2.6 -3.4<br/>  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---*|----|----|----|----|<br/>372.8 .0  71.2 70.4 369.6 68.8 68.0 67.2 66.4 65.6 64.8 64.0 63.2 62.4<br/>                Augmented second (17:14 = ~336.130)<br/>-5.5 -4.6 -3.7 -2.8 -1.9 -1.0 -0.1 +0.8 +1.7 +2.6 +3.5 +4.4 +5.3 +6.2<br/>  |----|----|----|----|----|----|*---|----|----|----|----|----|----|<br/>330.6 31.5 32.4 33.3 34.2 35.1 36.0 36.9 37.8 38.7 39.6 40.5 41.4 42.3</p><p>As this diagram may suggest, at 29-tET we are approaching the point<br/>where 13:11 becomes pure (fifth ~703.597 cents); just past 704 cents,<br/>we reach the tuning for a pure 17:14 (~704.014 cents). Continuing<br/>onward, we meet Keenan Pepper&apos;s Noble Tuning not quite halfway between<br/>this point and the tuning for a pure 21:17 (~704.272 cents).</p><p>At around 704.348 cents, we meet 46-tET, almost identical to the<br/>tuning with pure 14:11 major thirds (~704.377 cents). Thus this tuning<br/>might be called the neo-Gothic counterpart to 31-tET, likewise nearly<br/>identical to 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 major thirds -- with the<br/>distinction that while 14:11 and 5:4 are both esteemed ratios in these<br/>respective stylistic settings, the latter is a distinct &quot;valley&quot; while<br/>the former represents one of many shadings on the neo-Gothic plateau.</p><p>Slightly beyond 46-tET and the pure 14:11 tuning, with a fifth of<br/>~704.607 cents, the e-based tuning features regular thirds leaning<br/>slightly more toward 17-tET, and alternative thirds leaning slightly<br/>more toward &quot;neutrality.&quot; One curious trait is an augmented third<br/>(e.g. Eb-G#, the Pythagorean &quot;Wolf fourth&quot;) at ~550.676 cents, giving<br/>an excellent approximation of 11:8 (~551.318 cents). This interval can<br/>lend a unique flavor to certain neo-Gothic cadential progressions.[8]</p><p>To get another overview of the optimization problem, we can compare<br/>variances for each of the four ratios as found in each of these<br/>tunings:</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Tuning       Fifth        14:11       13:11       21:17       17:14<br/>          (Tempering)  (~417.508)  (~289.210)  (~365.825)  (~336.130)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>29-tET     ~703.448     ~413.793    ~289.655    ~372.414    ~331.034<br/>           (~+1.493)    (~-3.715)   (~+0.445)   (~+6.588)   (~-5.095)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>13:11      ~703.597     ~414.387    ~289.210    ~371.226    ~332.371<br/>           (~+1.642)    (~-3.121)      pure     (~+5.400)   (~-3.759)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>17:14      ~704.014     ~416.058    ~287.957    ~367.885    ~336.130<br/>           (~+2.059)    (~-1.450)   (~-1.253)   (~+2.059)      pure<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>KP         ~704.096     ~416.382    ~287.713    ~367.235    ~336.860<br/>           (~+2.141)    (~-1.126)    (-1.497)   (~+1.410)   (~+0.731)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>21:17      ~704.272     ~417.087    ~287.185    ~365.825    ~338.446<br/>           (~+2.317)    (~-0.421)   (~-2.025)      pure     (~+2.317)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>46-tET     ~704.348     ~417.391    ~286.957    ~365.217    ~339.130<br/>           (~+2.393)    (~-0.117)   (~-2.253)   (~-0.608)   (~+3.001)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>14:11      ~704.377     ~417.508    ~286.869    ~364.984    ~339.393<br/>            (+2.242)       pure     (~-2.341)   (~-0.841)   (~+3.263)<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>e-based    ~704.607     ~418.428    ~286.179    ~363.145    ~341.462<br/>           (~+2.652)    (~+0.920)   (~-3.030)   ~(-2.681)   (~+5.333)<br/>=====================================================================</p><p>If one wishes to approximate all four ratios within 1.5 cents, then<br/>Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning is an outstanding choice.</p><p>Both the above spectrum chart and this table may suggest how the size<br/>of our alternative thirds is very sensitive to the amount of<br/>tempering: a diminished fourth is formed from eight fourths up or<br/>fifths down, while an augmented second is formed from nine fifths up<br/>or fourths down.</p><p>Starting from Pythagorean, where these intervals form schisma thirds<br/>very close to 5:4 and 6:5, we find that by 29-tET they have become<br/>moderately complex at ~372.414 cents and ~331.014 cents. Their<br/>variance from 5-based ratios is interestingly very close to that of<br/>regular major and minor thirds in 12-tET, but in the opposite<br/>directions, ~-13.900 cents and ~+15.393 cents respectively.</p><p>Curiously, the 29-tET augmented second nicely approximates the Classic<br/>Mediant of 6:5 and 17:14, 23:19 (~330.761 cents), while the diminished<br/>fourth is not too far from the Classic Mediant of 5:4 and 21:17, 26:21<br/>(~369.747 cents). Thus these alternative thirds may share some of the<br/>active &quot;submajor/supraminor&quot; flavor which becomes more clearly defined<br/>as we move further into the &quot;Four Convivial Ratios&quot; region.</p><p>At a fifth size of around 704 cents or very slightly larger, the<br/>locale of Keenan Pepper&apos;s Noble Mediant tuning, we are in the central<br/>portion of the region offering close approximations of both 21:17 and<br/>17:14. This local zone might be seen as extending roughly to 46-tET or<br/>a pure 14:11 tuning.</p><p>By the point where we reach our e-based tuning at ~704.607 cents, the<br/>diminished fourth has contracted to around 363.145 cents, while the<br/>augmented second has expanded to ~341.462 cents. The contrast between<br/>these two sizes of alternative thirds still has the &quot;polarized&quot;<br/>quality of the region, but with a slight shading toward &quot;neutrality.&quot;</p><p>If we continue to increase the tempering of the fifth, we will soon<br/>reach the point at ~705.066 cents where the diminished fourth is at<br/>19:16 (~359.472 cents), often considered a variety of neutral third;<br/>the augmented second at ~345.594 cents would be very close to an<br/>11:9. From here to 17-tET, we may be dealing with fine gradients of<br/>neutrality.</p><p>To sum up, Keenan Pepper&apos;s noble tuning places us squarely in the<br/>center of a region where both regular and alternative thirds<br/>(diminished fourths and augmented seconds) have active qualities<br/>lending themselves admirably to neo-Gothic music. At the same time,<br/>the somewhat milder qualities of the regular thirds near 14:11 and<br/>13:11 in comparison to 17-tET may make this tuning somewhat more<br/>easily adaptable to a variety of timbres in &quot;conventional&quot; neo-Gothic<br/>styles following the 13th-14th century concept of these intervals as<br/>unstable but _relatively_ &quot;concordant.&quot;</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

In Part 2, I wrote: &quot;Much beyond Pythagorean, at<br/>least when seeking to maintain a 13th-14th century balance of<br/>concord/discord, we may &apos;Darregize/Sethareanize&apos; our timbres to keep<br/>our thirds _relatively_ blending while enjoying the &apos;superefficient&apos;<br/>resolutions they invite and the other special qualities of these<br/>tunings. With the right timbre for 17-tET, a half-cadence in Machaut<br/>on a major third can have the expected quality of a charming but<br/>pregnant pause rather than an acute clash!&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11096">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11096</a><br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11108">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11108</a></p><p>5.

Based on my &quot;unscientific&quot; experience with some neo-Gothic<br/>temperaments, I might tentatively conclude that the tuning of the<br/>major third may be more sensitive than that of the minor third, which<br/>might fit the Gothic role of an unstable &quot;semi-concord&quot; at almost any<br/>value between the Pythagorean 32:27 (~294.135 cents) and 7:6 (~266.871<br/>cents). Even in styles based on fully concordant thirds as the norm,<br/>meantone augmented seconds in this same range have sometimes been<br/>considered as acceptable consonances, and likewise 17-tET and 22-tET<br/>sonorities with the minor third below and major third above (the<br/>latter tuning very close to 6:7:9).</p><p>7. Another possible approach to explaining the musical &quot;conviviality&quot;<br/>of ratios at or near 21:17 and 17:14 to neo-Gothic style is to note<br/>that these intervals could be described as &quot;inverse Pythagorean&quot;<br/>thirds respectively about a syntonic comma (81:80, ~21.51 cents)<br/>_narrower_ than 5:4 and _wider_ than 6:5 respectively. The actual<br/>variance in each case is 85:84 (~20.488 cents).</p><p>8. Using a MIDI-style notation with C4 as middle C, the resolution of<br/>the sixth sonority B3-Eb4-G#4, with its &quot;near-11:8&quot; fourth between the<br/>two upper voices, to A3-E4-A4 is a typical neo-Gothic progression<br/>involving this interval. More specifically, the size of this &quot;large<br/>fourth,&quot; in comparison with a pure 11:8 (~551.318 cents), will be<br/>~545.052 cents in Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning; ~547.826 cents in 46-tET<br/>(21/46 octave); ~548.147 cents in a regular tuning with pure 14:11<br/>major thirds; and ~550.676 cents in the e-based tuning.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
