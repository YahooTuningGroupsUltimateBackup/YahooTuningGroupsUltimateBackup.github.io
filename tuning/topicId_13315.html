Attention, I&apos;m not promoting with that<br/>an alternative to Paul&apos;s theory. I hope it&apos;s clear that using of pure<br/>numerical values for this parallel don&apos;t mean there is no need for a<br/>smoothed upper-limited perceptive concept on which Paul is working. I&apos;ll<br/>show how question arise in numbers before asking if relevant in Paul&apos;s<br/>theory for ranking tetrads.</p><p>For each numerical tetrad a:b:c:d, we can associate the vector of 6 dyads<br/>sonance (S(a:b), S(b:c), S(c:d), S(a:c), S(b:d), S(a:d)). Sonance is<br/>logarithm in base 2 of complexity defined as n*d for irreductible fraction<br/>n/d. (I use my proper terminology for I&apos;m not sure if Tenny&apos;s distance is<br/>the complexity or its logarithm).</p><p>I&apos;ll use for the following examples only complexities vector. (Sonances<br/>vector can be obtained taking log values : lg(x) = ln(x)/ln(2))</p><p>4:5:6:7    == (4*5,5*6,6*7,2*3,5*7,4*7)  = (20,30,42,20,6,28)<br/>8:10:12:15 == (4*5,5*6,4*5,2*3,2*3,8*15) = (20,30,20,6,6,120)</p><p>We can see how factorization properties act here. Complexity of ratio Kn:Kd<br/>is n*d and then reduced by square of common factor K. If all the values<br/>a:b:c:d were relatively primes there could not exist reduction. In attempt<br/>to conceive global &quot;sonance&quot; of a chord (and it&apos;s surely an aspect of the<br/>perception) as a totalness applied to the 6 dyads sonance, question arise<br/>on manner to reduce a six elements vector to give the best representative<br/>scalar. Among possibilities  we can note these sums :</p><p>       arithmetic sum     u + v + w ...</p><p>        vectorial sum     sqrt( u*u + v*v + w*w ... )</p><p>      geometrical sum     log u + log v + log w ...</p><p>         harmonic sum     1/( 1/u + 1/v + 1/w ... )</p><p>Maybe there could exist in Paul&apos;s theory a choice inherent to the entropy<br/>concept about which I have only a vague idea. This discussion has sense<br/>only if  it&apos;s not the case and if question would be possibly open.</p><p>Two properties of Stern-Brocot tree tend to point out distinct choices. The<br/>first one is the fact that Stern-Brocot tree can be built, on the<br/>logarithmic representation with distance concept acting on (w,s) dyads,<br/>where w = (log n - log d) is the width and s = (log n + log d) is the<br/>sonance of interval. Distance used is sqrt( w*w + s*s ). Starting with<br/>(0,0) representing 1/1 and going up tracing for each dyad an arc towards<br/>nearest left dyad and nearest right dyad, we consitute the Stern-Brocot<br/>tree. This property don&apos;t exist on (n,d) dyads with same distance. On the<br/>following representation of first octave subtree the thing is obvious<br/>excepted for few cases resulting of compressed representation on y-axis.</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/stern-brocot.gif">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/pix/stern-brocot.gif</a></p><p>The other property is existence of characterized harmonic sums on<br/>complexities as described, for example, in my post &quot;Distribution variant&quot;<br/>at number 12928. Harmonic sum of complexities on each layer of Stern-Brocot<br/>tree is equal to 1.</p><p>As phi joins additive and multiplicative properties (phi * phi = phi + 1),<br/>Stern-Brocot tree appears a golden structure as a whole, blending additive<br/>et multiplicative properties in such manner that we have often to consider<br/>a complementary approach for each problem.</p><p>I leave theoritical considerations here waiting before to deepen to know if<br/>relevant in ranking tetrads.</p><p>Returning to numerical example, a more empirical approach would ask how can<br/>be balanced vectorial components ?</p><p>4:5:6:7    == (20,30,42,20,6,28) == (,,42,,28)<br/>8:10:12:15 == (20,30,20,6,6,120) == (,,,6,120)</p><p>How is perceived a high dissonance isolated in remains consonant chord as<br/>compared to less consonant but more balanced chord ?</p><p>Since I&apos;m not musician and I don&apos;t have means to experiment myself I ask<br/>simply  the question.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 7:00:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Pierre Lamothe &lt;plamothe@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13315">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13315</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 13293 you wrote :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; Why would this pair be so down the scale at 22-23, when the<br/>&gt;    4:5:6:7 is so very concordant it hardly beats at all!
