However, leaves out<br/>the quarter turns of the octahedron, as they are not isometries of the tetrahedron.<br/>Nor are the central inversions.</p><p>So looks as though the group of transformations by remapping the hexany<br/>factors is another subgroup isomorphic to S4.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s how you would make the group go from 24 to 48 elements, the<br/>&gt; full group of isometries of an octahedron.</p><p>Okay, and I realised that the map from 2 3 5 7 to 1/2 1/3 1/5 1/7<br/>is the central inversion rather than reflection in equatorial square.</p><p>Also did some figuring and found the other octahedron symmetries.</p><p>2 3 5 7 -&gt; 3 2 5 7 = reflection in midpoint of edge, already have.</p><p>2 3 5 7 -&gt; 3 2 7 5 = half turn about vertex</p><p>2 3 5 7 -&gt; 3 5 2 7 = third turn about centre of face</p><p>2 3 5 7 -&gt; 3 7 2 5 = quarter turn rotary reflection in equatorial square</p><p>2 3 5 7 -&gt; 1/2 1/3 1/5 1/7 = central inversion.</p><p>Reflection in equatorial square = half turn + central inversion.</p><p>Quarter turn = quarter turn rotary reflection + central inversion</p><p>3 7 2 5 -&gt; 2 3 5 7 -&gt; 1/2 1/3 1/5 1/7</p><p>I.e. 3 -&gt; 1/3, 7 -&gt; 1/3  2 -&gt; 1/5 5 -&gt; 1/7</p><p>then one&apos;s got the octahedral group from the reflection in midpoint<br/>of edge, third turn, and quarter turn. Add the central inversion<br/>to get the complete orthogonal group.</p><p>(N.B. I use 2 instead of 1 here because it means program can find<br/>the factors for remapping by factorisation, which doesn&apos;t work if<br/>one of them is 1)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Do you have any suggestions for a suitable ascii format?</p><p>&gt; I would suggest a note number, followed by a value in cents, in front<br/>&gt; of the rest of the score. If a program which  converts an ascii score<br/>&gt; file to midi knows to always output note x as y cents from the<br/>&gt; reference frequency, you can remap the notes to other notes.</p><p>Okay, that&apos;s possible. Presumably it would be nice to show cents or ratios as appropriate<br/>for each note? - that is easy to do in FTS as it is all programmed in.</p><p>Could also give the midi note number for the 1/1, and its freq in<br/>herz, in a text event.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I can add a record to text as a third option (at present has<br/>&gt; &gt; record to WAVE, and to MIDI). Could be a useful thing to have.</p><p>&gt; I would say definitely yes.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>I wonder what ascii format to base it around?</p><p>abc is limiting for multiple parts, and rather complex to program<br/>if converting to it from a midi file, and the midi2txt format is<br/>easier to do, but then one can get to it anyway using the free<br/>utility to convert a midi file to text.</p><p>I could just have option to add a text event to the midi file listing all the midi notes<br/>from 0 to 127, and cents values or ratios from the 1/1 for each. Then user can use<br/>mf2t to convert the midi file to ascii. Or could do the midi file save to text<br/>in mf2t format - from the mf2t readme, it seems pretty straightforward to do that.</p><p>A remapping program can then process the ascii file, but only change the<br/>note numbers and pitch bend data.</p><p>Except, come to think of it, it would also need to remap the channels too.<br/>Two notes will be in same channel if they have the same pitch bend, and after<br/>remap, especially if it changes octave relationships, it may no longer be<br/>possible to place the same notes in the same channels.</p><p>When changing channels for pitch bends, the remapping program would also need<br/>to keep track of which patches are in use for the notes before the<br/>map and apply them if necessary in the new channel, and possibly<br/>track midi controllers as well (not needed for the hexany trio).</p><p>This can sometimes get a little involved.</p><p>I wonder if there can be some way to avoid need to get into all that<br/>for the examples you want to make?</p><p>One idea is to specify the remapping one wants in a file with same<br/>file name as the .mid file, but with extension .midi_remap (or something).</p><p>Could look like this:</p><p>hexany_trio.midi_remap,<br/>-----------------<br/>reduce_octave 2/1</p><p>a = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 3 2 5 7<br/>b = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 5 2 3 7<br/>c = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 1/5 1/2 1/7 1/3<br/>d = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 1/2 1/3 1/5 1/7<br/>a b ab b2 ab2<br/>c ac bc abc b2c ab2c<br/>c2 ac2 bc2 abc2 b2c2 ab2c2<br/>c3 ac3 bc3 abc3 b2c3 ab2c3</p><p>d ad bd abd b2d ab2d<br/>cd acd bcd abcd b2cd ab2cd<br/>c2d ac2d bc2d abc2d b2c2d ab2c2d<br/>c3d ac3d bc3d abc3d b2c3d ab2c3d<br/>------------------</p><p>With that saved in same folder as hexany_trio.mid<br/>then when you open hexany_trio.mid for playing in FTS,<br/>it would play all 48 variations.</p><p>here for ex ab2c2d = apply a then b twice, then c twice, then d<br/>to the original scale before playing the tune.</p><p>That would be pretty easy to program.</p><p>Idea is, before playing each variation, it remaps the<br/>scale. Keeps the order of the notes in the<br/>scale the same each time (so transformed scale is not nec. an<br/>ascending one).</p><p>It would be easy to do because all the programming would<br/>be in one place, just have a little program that reads the<br/>remap file, transforms the scale as instructed, and then<br/>calls other routines already programmed to play the<br/>midi clip with the transformed scale, and save it.</p><p>If recording to midi at the time, it would modify the<br/>file name for each one and save them as:</p><p>hexany_trio_a.mid, hexany_trio_b.mid, hexany_trio ab.mid<br/>hexany_trio_b2.mid,...</p><p>One would use hexany scale in the non octave reduced form, with<br/>2s instead of 1s (as octave reduction 2s will confuse the remap)</p><p>For the symbols to define at head of the file, one could<br/>use any ascii symbols except the numerals 0 to 9,<br/>which should be plenty for most situations.</p><p>I wonder how all this fits in with what you said<br/>about keeping octaves invariant and making sure the melody doesn&apos;t<br/>vary wildly in your reply to Paul.</p><p>(didn&apos;t follow the matrix maths, as I don&apos;t know the context,<br/>such as what 4-et means or the reason for using left and right<br/>eigenvectors, or why those particular powers of 2 3 5 7) )</p><p>...............................................</p><p>I also have idea of the log to include time information<br/>and maybe also patches, and note volumes.</p><p>The thing that would make this approach particularly<br/>suitable is that one could also add option to read<br/>a log in that format, and play it in FTS.</p><p>So then, you wouldn&apos;t need to get into all the<br/>channel remapping and patch tracking for channels,<br/>but just leave it to FTS to do it.</p><p>Not meant to be as flexible as the full midi format,<br/>just a nice easy way of making midi clips in microtonal<br/>scales.</p><p>This last idea might take a little bit more programming<br/>than the other two.</p><p>.............................................</p><p>Anywya, those are the three main possiblities I can think of<br/>at present.</p><p>&gt; I would say whatever you do, it should allow you to at least take the<br/>&gt; set of all notes which appear in a given piece, and remap them to<br/>&gt; other notes; it doesn&apos;t seem to me what you are talking about below<br/>&gt; does that. There are other kinds of remappings which this won&apos;t<br/>&gt; support but I think getting at least that far would be grand.</p><p>As for the factor remapping channel, that would also work<br/>for all the notes in a uniform way - possibly I didn&apos;t<br/>explain it that well. If you play the 3 &lt;-&gt; 5 key on the<br/>midi keyboard then it transforms all the scales used in<br/>all the playing channels, by swapping 3s for 5s in them.</p><p>Details were to do with how to specify that a particular<br/>midi note is to have that effect, and were just first<br/>thoughts about how one might do it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=27974 href="#27974">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/8/2001 9:32:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You can get octahedron by joining mid points of edges of a<br/>tetrahedron<br/>&gt; (then continuing process with octahedron -&gt; cube -&gt; cubocatahedron)</p><p>Then rotations of the octahedron can convert a major (utonal)<br/>tetahedron to a minor one, and vice-versa.</p><p>&gt; (N.B. I use 2 instead of 1 here because it means program can find<br/>&gt; the factors for remapping by factorization, which doesn&apos;t work if<br/>&gt; one of them is 1)</p><p>Actually, I wouldn&apos;t want the program to do this in this way. The<br/>procedure I had in mind is this:</p><p>We take 3,5,7,15,21,35 and divide by 7, getting 3/7,5/7,1,15/7,3,5;<br/>the reason for this is that while we can transform in a way which<br/>keeps vertices, edges, faces or cells invariant, we want to start by<br/>keeping a vertex 1/1 fixed, since this is easier mathematically.</p><p>Fixing 1 and rotating the lattice around the 7/5-1-10/7 axis, turns<br/>our reference octahedron upside-down and moves it down. It gives us<br/>the mapping 1-&gt;3/3, 3-&gt;3/1, 5-&gt;3/5, 7-&gt;3/7, which we can also write<br/>in matrix form as</p><p>    [1  0  0]<br/>m = [1 -1  0]<br/>    [1  0 -1],</p><p>where we multiply row vectors by m to map them: for instance [0 1 0]<br/>representing the 5 class is mapped to [1 -1 0], representing 3/5.<br/>Since the determinant of the above matrix is 1, it is a rotation and<br/>not a reflection. It represents a genuine rotation of an octahedron<br/>since we can specify a corresponding quadratic form (distance<br/>measure) on 7-limit classes by finding the distance of 3^a 5^b 7^c<br/>from 1 by taking the square root of a^2+b^2+c^2+ab+ac+bc.</p><p>We now want to lift m from a transformation on octave equivalence<br/>classes to notes in the 7-limit. If we set</p><p>    [1  0  0  0]<br/>    [a  1  0  0]<br/>M = [b  1 -1  0]<br/>    [c  1  0 -1]</p><p>then [1 0 0 0]M = [1 0 0 0]. This means that octaves are left fixed<br/>by M, and [1 0 0 0] is an eigenvector for the value 1 for M. There<br/>must be another eigenvector for 1 which is a column vector v such<br/>that Mv = v. If v is the column vector</p><p>   [ln(2)]<br/>   [ln(3)]<br/>   [ln(5)]<br/>   [ln(7)]</p><p>then Mv = v would mean all 7-limit notes would be left fixed. If v is<br/>approximately such a column vector, then 7-limit notes will be<br/>approximately fixed. In particular, let us take a column vector<br/>derived from the division of the octave into four parts, which gives<br/>us</p><p>   [ 4]<br/>   [ 6]<br/>   [ 9]<br/>   [11].</p><p>If this is left fixed by M, 7-limit notes will not wander too wildly.<br/>They will in fact transform so that 8/7, 7/6, 6/5 and 5/4 stay in a<br/>class of one-step intervals; 4/3, 7/5, 10/7 and 3/2 in a class of two-<br/>step intervals, and 8/5,5/3,12/7 and 7/4 in a class with three steps,<br/>so that 1, 3, 5 and 7 go to distinct classes. If now we solve for a,<br/>b, and c we find we get integer values and so we can do this lifting,<br/>obtaining</p><p>    [1  0  0  0]<br/>    [0  1  0  0]<br/>M = [3  1 -1  0]<br/>    [4  1  0 -1].</p><p>If we write this multiplicatively, we get 2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;3, 5-&gt;24/5, and<br/>7-&gt;48/7; this is in fact the major-minor, minor-major transformation<br/>in the 7-limit.</p><p>Let us now look at a rotation by a quarter turn. If we rotate counter-<br/>clockwise around the axis passing through 1 and perpendicular to the<br/>square with corners 1, 3, 7/5 and (opposite 1) 15/7, we get a map r<br/>which sends 1-&gt;7/7, 3-&gt;7/5, 5-&gt;7/1, 7-&gt;7/3. If we write this in<br/>matrix form, we get</p><p>    [ 0 -1 -1]<br/>r = [ 0  0  1]<br/>    [-1  0 -1],</p><p>which again has determinant 1 and is a rotational isometry. If we try<br/>to lift this as before, we find we can&apos;t--we are &quot;obstructed&quot; as a<br/>mathematician might say. However, we can lift it if we do so<br/>inversely, by sending 2-&gt;1/2, and making the 4-division column vector<br/>an eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1. When we do that, we get</p><p>    [-1  0  0  0]<br/>    [-2  0 -1  1]<br/>R = [-5  0  0  1]<br/>    [ 4  1  0 -1],</p><p>which is of order 4 and which approximately inverts. While r had a<br/>determinant of 1, det(R) = -1, but it does correspond to a rotation<br/>of the hexany even so.</p><p>Finally, we want an element of order 3. Rotating in the plane of a<br/>triangular lattice lying in the 5-limit, we send 1-&gt;5/5, 3-&gt;1/5 and<br/>5-&gt;3/5; we then extend this to the 7-limit by 7-&gt;7/5. However, we now<br/>run into trouble. This transformation works very well in the 5-limit<br/>when we make it preserve the 3-et instead of the 4-et, but in the 7-<br/>limit we find we cannot lift it and preserve the 4-et either directly<br/>or inversely. We can do the best we can in the situation by making<br/>the lifting a matrix of order three which preserves the column vector<br/>of logarithms as closely as we can contrive. When we do this, we lift</p><p>    [0 -1  0]<br/>g = [1 -1  0]<br/>    [0 -1  1]</p><p>to</p><p>    [1 0  0  0]<br/>    [3 0 -1  0]<br/>G = [3 1 -1  0]<br/>    [2 0 -1  1],</p><p>which written multiplicatively is the map 2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;8/5, 5-&gt;24/5, and<br/>7-&gt;28/5.</p><p>If we apply these mappings, the hexany will be transposed to another.<br/>However, we can shift it back. If we take the vectors representing<br/>the vertices of the hexany and average them, we find its center, so<br/>all we need do is move the center of the transformed hexany back to<br/>the original. For instance, our starting hexany written in vector<br/>form is [0 0 0], [1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 1 -1], [1 1 -1] and [1 0 -1];<br/>adding these up gives us [3 3 -3] and so the center is<br/>[1/2 1/2 -1/2]. Transforming this by r gives us [0 0 0], [0 -1 1],<br/>[0 0 1], [1 0 0], [1 -1 1] and [1 -1 0]. Adding these gives us<br/>[3 -3 3] with center [1/2 -1/2 1/2]. Then [3 3 -3] - [3 -3 3] =<br/>[0 6 -6], so dividing by six we find we can shift it back by adding<br/>[0 1 -1]; note that this way of doing things means we can use integer<br/>arithmetic.</p><p>By successively applying these transformations it is easy to get all<br/>24 rotations of the octahedron; the full isometry group is obtained<br/>by simply adding the negatives of the rotation matrices; in other<br/>words, multiplying them by</p><p>[-1  0  0  0]<br/>[ 0 -1  0  0]<br/>[ 0  0 -1  0]<br/>[ 0  0  0 -1],</p><p>which multiplicatively is simply the inversion map x--1/x.</p><p>I hope all that was clear!</p><p>&gt; Okay, that&apos;s possible. Presumably it would be nice to show cents or<br/>ratios as appropriate<br/>&gt; for each note? - that is easy to do in FTS as it is all programmed<br/>in.</p><p>Sounds good; I take it you have a continued fraction routine in FTS?</p><p>&gt; I wonder if there can be some way to avoid need to get into all that<br/>&gt; for the examples you want to make?</p><p>Probably, but the other way sounds like a wonderful addition to FTS.</p></div><h3><a id=27976 href="#27976">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/8/2001 10:45:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt;     [1 0  0 0]<br/>&gt;     [3 0 -1 0]<br/>&gt; G = [3 1 -1 0]<br/>&gt;     [2 0 -1 1],<br/>&gt; &gt; which written multiplicatively is the map 2-&gt;2, 3-&gt;8/5, 5-&gt;24/5,<br/>and &gt; 7-&gt;28/5.</p><p>I became so wrapped up in group theory I forgot to mention an<br/>important point, which is that from a practical, musical perspective<br/>we don&apos;t want to use G, we want to use</p><p>    [1 0  0 0]<br/>    [4 0 -1 0]<br/>S = [3 1 -1 0]<br/>    [2 0 -1 1],</p><p>and instead of using S^2 we take instead</p><p>         [1  0 0 0]<br/>         [1 -1 1 0]<br/>S^(-1) = [4 -1 0 0]<br/>         [2 -1 0 1].</p><p>This is no longer of finite order, which doesn&apos;t much matter though<br/>it does mean intervals are no longer locked into the classes I<br/>mentioned.

Presumably it would be nice<br/>&gt; to show cents or ratios as appropriate<br/>&gt; for each note? - that is easy to do in FTS as it is<br/>&gt; all programmed in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could also give the midi note number for the 1/1,<br/>&gt; and its freq in<br/>&gt; herz, in a text event.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I can add a record to text as a third option (at<br/>&gt; present has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; record to WAVE, and to MIDI). Could be a useful<br/>&gt; thing to have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would say definitely yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder what ascii format to base it around?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; abc is limiting for multiple parts, and rather<br/>&gt; complex to program<br/>&gt; if converting to it from a midi file, and the<br/>&gt; midi2txt format is<br/>&gt; easier to do, but then one can get to it anyway<br/>&gt; using the free<br/>&gt; utility to convert a midi file to text.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could just have option to add a text event to the<br/>&gt; midi file listing all the midi notes<br/>&gt; from 0 to 127, and cents values or ratios from the<br/>&gt; 1/1 for each. Then user can use<br/>&gt; mf2t to convert the midi file to ascii. Or could do<br/>&gt; the midi file save to text<br/>&gt; in mf2t format - from the mf2t readme, it seems<br/>&gt; pretty straightforward to do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A remapping program can then process the ascii file,<br/>&gt; but only change the<br/>&gt; note numbers and pitch bend data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Except, come to think of it, it would also need to<br/>&gt; remap the channels too.<br/>&gt; Two notes will be in same channel if they have the<br/>&gt; same pitch bend, and after<br/>&gt; remap, especially if it changes octave<br/>&gt; relationships, it may no longer be<br/>&gt; possible to place the same notes in the same<br/>&gt; channels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When changing channels for pitch bends, the<br/>&gt; remapping program would also need<br/>&gt; to keep track of which patches are in use for the<br/>&gt; notes before the<br/>&gt; map and apply them if necessary in the new channel,<br/>&gt; and possibly<br/>&gt; track midi controllers as well (not needed for the<br/>&gt; hexany trio).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This can sometimes get a little involved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder if there can be some way to avoid need to<br/>&gt; get into all that<br/>&gt; for the examples you want to make?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One idea is to specify the remapping one wants in a<br/>&gt; file with same<br/>&gt; file name as the .mid file, but with extension<br/>&gt; .midi_remap (or something).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could look like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hexany_trio.midi_remap,<br/>&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt; reduce_octave 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 3 2 5 7<br/>&gt; b = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 5 2 3 7<br/>&gt; c = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 1/5 1/2 1/7 1/3<br/>&gt; d = 2 3 5 7 &gt; 1/2 1/3 1/5 1/7<br/>&gt; a b ab b2 ab2<br/>&gt; c ac bc abc b2c ab2c<br/>&gt; c2 ac2 bc2 abc2 b2c2 ab2c2<br/>&gt; c3 ac3 bc3 abc3 b2c3 ab2c3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; d ad bd abd b2d ab2d<br/>&gt; cd acd bcd abcd b2cd ab2cd<br/>&gt; c2d ac2d bc2d abc2d b2c2d ab2c2d<br/>&gt; c3d ac3d bc3d abc3d b2c3d ab2c3d<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With that saved in same folder as hexany_trio.mid<br/>&gt; then when you open hexany_trio.mid for playing in<br/>&gt; FTS,<br/>&gt; it would play all 48 variations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; here for ex ab2c2d = apply a then b twice, then c<br/>&gt; twice, then d<br/>&gt; to the original scale before playing the tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be pretty easy to program.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Idea is, before playing each variation, it remaps<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; scale. Keeps the order of the notes in the<br/>&gt; scale the same each time (so transformed scale is<br/>&gt; not nec. an<br/>&gt; ascending one).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be easy to do because all the programming<br/>&gt; would<br/>&gt; be in one place, just have a little program that<br/>&gt; reads the<br/>&gt; remap file, transforms the scale as instructed, and<br/>&gt; then<br/>&gt; calls other routines already programmed to play the<br/>&gt; midi clip with the transformed scale, and save it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If recording to midi at the time, it would modify<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; file name for each one and save them as:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hexany_trio_a.mid, hexany_trio_b.mid, hexany_trio<br/>&gt; ab.mid<br/>&gt; hexany_trio_b2.mid,...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One would use hexany scale in the non octave reduced<br/>&gt; form, with<br/>&gt; 2s instead of 1s (as octave reduction 2s will<br/>&gt; confuse the remap)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the symbols to define at head of the file, one<br/>&gt; could<br/>&gt; use any ascii symbols except the numerals 0 to 9,<br/>&gt; which should be plenty for most situations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder how all this fits in with what you said<br/>&gt; about keeping octaves invariant and making sure the<br/>&gt; melody doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; vary wildly in your reply to Paul.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (didn&apos;t follow the matrix maths, as I don&apos;t know the<br/>&gt; context,<br/>&gt; such as what 4-et means or the reason for using left<br/>&gt; and right<br/>&gt; eigenvectors, or why those particular powers of 2 3<br/>&gt; 5 7) )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...............................................<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also have idea of the log to include time<br/>&gt; information<br/>&gt; and maybe also patches, and note volumes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thing that would make this approach particularly<br/>&gt; suitable is that one could also add option to read<br/>&gt; a log in that format, and play it in FTS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So then, you wouldn&apos;t need to get into all the<br/>&gt; channel remapping and patch tracking for channels,<br/>&gt; but just leave it to FTS to do it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not meant to be as flexible as the full midi format,<br/>&gt; just a nice easy way of making midi clips in<br/>&gt; microtonal<br/>&gt; scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This last idea might take a little bit more<br/>&gt; programming<br/>&gt; than the other two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .............................................<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anywya, those are the three main possiblities I can<br/>&gt; think of<br/>&gt; at present.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would say whatever you do, it should allow you<br/>&gt; to at least take the<br/>&gt; &gt; set of all notes which appear in a given piece,<br/>&gt; and remap them to<br/>&gt; &gt; other notes; it doesn&apos;t seem to me what you are<br/>&gt; talking about below<br/>&gt; &gt; does that. There are other kinds of remappings<br/>&gt; which this won&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; support but I think getting at least that far<br/>&gt; would be grand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the factor remapping channel, that would also<br/>&gt; work<br/>&gt; for all the notes in a uniform way - possibly I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; explain it that well. If you play the 3 &lt;-&gt; 5 key on<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; midi keyboard then it transforms all the scales used<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; all the playing channels, by swapping 3s for 5s in<br/>&gt; them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Details were to do with how to specify that a<br/>&gt; particular<br/>&gt; midi note is to have that effect, and were just<br/>&gt; first<br/>&gt; thoughts about how one might do it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>___________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!? -- Un e-mail gratuit <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.fr !<br/>Yahoo!

This means that octaves are left fixed<br/>&gt; by M, and [1 0 0 0] is an eigenvector for the value 1 for M. There<br/>&gt; must be another eigenvector for 1 which is a column vector v such<br/>&gt; that Mv = v. If v is the column vector</p><p>&gt;    [ln(2)]<br/>&gt;    [ln(3)]<br/>&gt;    [ln(5)]<br/>&gt;    [ln(7)]</p><p>&gt; then Mv = v would mean all 7-limit notes would be left fixed. If v is<br/>&gt; approximately such a column vector, then 7-limit notes will be<br/>&gt; approximately fixed. In particular, let us take a column vector</p><p>Here the idea is that you&apos;ve got some representation of a number<br/>as<br/>2^x*3^y*5^z*7^w</p><p>and you want to transform it to<br/>2^x&apos;*3^y&apos;*5^z&apos;*7^w&apos;<br/>in a way that preserves all notes which have y=z=w=0 (octaves)</p><p>and that keeps other notes as close as possible to their<br/>original size.</p><p>That [1 0 0 0] is a left eigenvector shows that one preserves the<br/>octaves.</p><p>Why though, does having</p><p>&gt;    [ln(2)]<br/>&gt;    [ln(3)]<br/>&gt;    [ln(5)]<br/>&gt;    [ln(7)]</p><p>as a right eigenvector<br/>mean that one preserves all the 7 limit notes?</p><p>I&apos;ve done a bit of puzzling out but can&apos;t quite see it yet...</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s very nice, and I could program FTS to read a matrix<br/>and use it to transform 7 limit notes.</p><p>One doesn&apos;t know till one gets down to it, but I think it would be pretty easy.</p><p>Here is my idea for the file format:</p><p>Reserve I for identity matrix, then:</p><p>hexany_trio.midi_remap,<br/>-----------------<br/>factors_to_remap 2 3 5 7<br/>preserve cofg_of_scale<br/>M =<br/>1  0  0  0<br/>0  1  0  0<br/>3  1 -1  0<br/>4  1  0 -1<br/>!reflection order 2</p><p>R =<br/>-1  0  0  0<br/>-2  0 -1  1<br/>-5  0  0  1<br/>4  1  0 -1<br/>!rotation order 4</p><p>S =<br/>1 0  0 0<br/>4 0 -1 0<br/>3 1 -1 0<br/>2 0 -1 1<br/>!rotation order 3</p><p>T =<br/>1  0 0 0<br/>1 -1 1 0<br/>4 -1 0 0<br/>2 -1 0 1<br/>!T is S^-1</p><p>U =<br/>-1  0  0  0<br/> 0 -1  0  0<br/> 0  0 -1  0<br/> 0  0  0 -1<br/>!inversion</p><p>I R R2 R3 M MR MR2 MR3<br/>U RU R2U R3U MU MRU MR2U MR3U<br/>S RS R2S R3S MS MRS MR2S MR3S<br/>SU RSU R2SU R3SU MSU MRSU MR2SU MR3SU<br/>T RT R2T R3T MT MRT MR2T MR3T<br/>TU RTU R2TU R3TU MTU MRTU MR2TU MR3TU<br/>I<br/>------------------</p><p>The ! lines are comments.</p><p>The line<br/>preserve cofg_of_scale</p><p>means that one is to find the product of all the ntoes of the scale, and take nth root<br/>where n is number of notes.</p><p>Then do same for the remapped scale.</p><p>Then divide all the notes in the remapped scale by the ratio of these<br/>two values.</p><p>This will have same effect as adding your [0 1 -1] etc., but be<br/>easier to program.</p><p>As before, MR3TU means apply M then R three times, then T, then U.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=27986 href="#27986">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/9/2001 11:32:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Why though, does having<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ln(2)]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ln(3)]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ln(5)]<br/>&gt; &gt;    [ln(7)]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as a right eigenvector<br/>&gt; mean that one preserves all the 7 limit notes?</p><p>If you have a note [a b c d], then playing the note can be accomplised<br/>by computing exp(a ln(2) + b ln(3) + c ln(5) + d ln(7)).

The first t<br/>is pretty redundant really. 4 tone equal temperament -&gt; 4 equal temperament.</p><p>Some of us call it 4-edo, meaning 4 equal divisions of the octave; doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to be as much used as 4-et.</p><p>&gt; &gt; With any luck, we&apos;ll have some music to show for it soon<br/>&gt; &gt; :-)</p><p>&gt; Sounds good. There are related ideas I once used in my own version of<br/>&gt; a music-generating program, by the way. If you feel like working on<br/>&gt; FTS they might come in handy.</p><p>Thanks, I&apos;ll be interested to hear about them :-)</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking it might be nice to transform scales while playing<br/>the fractal tunes in FTS.</p><p>I wonder also about transforming tunes in general. Normally they aren&apos;t going<br/>to work harmonically in 12-tone j.i. I suppose, e.g. if they have D minor<br/>triads, dep. on how they are meant to be heard. So presumably first you<br/>need to find suitable j.i. ratios for a tune before you can start<br/>transforming the harmonies?</p><p>Anyway, back to your idea:</p><p>I&apos;ve got it working for the M, S, T and U arrays.</p><p>Here is a sequence for my hexany phrase using just<br/>the M, S and T arrays, on violin:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/Robert%20Walker/hp_I_M_S_MS_T_MT_I.mid">/tuning/files/Robert%20Walker/hp_I_M_S_MS_T_MT_I.mid</a></p><p>The U and R arrays both invert the ratios. This sends the violin very low<br/>(with 1/1 = middle C)</p><p>Here, using the idea that if the cofg of the remapped scale is less than<br/>1, transpose it up by, say, 2 octaves (number of octaves for transposition<br/>specified in the remap file.</p><p>Here it is on violin with the U:<br/><a href="/tuning/files/Robert%20Walker/hp_I_U_M_UM_S_US_MS_UMS_T_UT_MT_UMT_I.mid">/tuning/files/Robert%20Walker/hp_I_U_M_UM_S_US_MS_UMS_T_UT_MT_UMT_I.mid</a></p><p>The R array also inverts the ratios.</p><p>However, it doesn&apos;t seem to work quite yet.<br/>Gives a very broken melody.</p><p>Here is what happens with it:</p><p>===============================</p><p>ratio 6/5 = 1.2</p><p>  1   1  -1   0<br/>*R<br/> -1   0   0   0<br/> -2   0  -1   1<br/> -5   0   0   1<br/>  4   1   0  -1</p><p>=<br/>  2   0  -1   0</p><p>mapped to 0.8</p><p>Cofg shift: 0.8*12.218 = 9.77443</p><p>===============================</p><p>ratio 6/7 = 0.857143</p><p>  1   1   0  -1<br/>*R<br/> -1   0   0   0<br/> -2   0  -1   1<br/> -5   0   0   1<br/>  4   1   0  -1</p><p>=<br/> -7  -1  -1   2</p><p>mapped to 0.0255208</p><p>Cofg shift: 0.0255208*12.218 = 0.311815</p><p>===============================</p><p>Can you see what&apos;s happening from this?</p><p>I&apos;m enjoying your idea! I say on the tunes page,<br/>it could be seed for a larger piece later. Maybe this is it :-)</p><p>Have you thought of rotating in the 1 3 5 7 11 lattice<br/>- and so moving the hexany to the 1 3 5 11 hexany etc?<br/>- if your technique works for 5 factors.</p><p>I&apos;ve done the programming so that a factor doesn&apos;t have to be prime,<br/>so one can experiment with the 1 3 5 9 hexany etc,<br/>if you can figure out good matrices for it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=28059 href="#28059">ðŸ”—</a>Latchezar Dimitrov &#x3C;latchezar_d@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/11/2001 5:31:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>32 OR 64?
