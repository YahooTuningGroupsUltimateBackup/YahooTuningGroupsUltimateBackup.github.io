So I went down to Best Buy and bought<br/>four different pairs of headphones for under $40/pair.  The results...</p><p>For $10 you can&apos;t do better than Sony&apos;s &quot;H.EAR Vertical&quot; phones,<br/>MDR-J10.  They sound great, and are (for me) comfortable to wear<br/>for hours.  Rather than being attached to a band to go over or<br/>behind the head, they sit on the ear, but they&apos;re super-lightweight<br/>and place no stress on my ears whatsoever (and don&apos;t make you<br/>feel like you&apos;re wearing headgear).</p><p>For $40, the MDR-EX51LP are amazing.  They&apos;re in-the-ear style,<br/>which some people don&apos;t like.  But these don&apos;t bother me a bit,<br/>they&apos;re only slightly less comfortable than the above phones, and<br/>the in-the-ear style provides some isolation if you&apos;re trying to<br/>listen in a noisy cafe.  And the drivers can be nearly microscopic,<br/>which means they can be incredibly cheap while still being light,<br/>fast, and accurate.  These are rated at 100 dB/mW sensitivity with<br/>a frequency response of 6-23K Hz!  You can practically power them<br/>by looking at them aggressively.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=52269 href="#52269">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2004 9:50:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; For $40, the MDR-EX51LP are amazing.</p><p>I&apos;m going to look for these from a place I can return them if they suck, because occasionally it would be nice to have in-ear (and cheap) phones.
