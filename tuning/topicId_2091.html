I did it. I also added<br/>  Hahn/Op de Coul triangular distance (as you suggested earlier) and<br/>  Hahn/Op de Coul with 2&apos;s<br/>I&apos;d appreciate it if you&apos;d check a few values for correctness (I haven&apos;t<br/>checked). Base 2 logs were used for all.</p><p>I&apos;ve compared these 5 on a separate chart from the others (since they are<br/>log). Scroll down to see it. Also the first chart is too cluttered. Better<br/>to just compare a few at a time. I suggest going to<br/>Chart/Source_Data/Series and removing the ones that don&apos;t interest you.</p><p>It&apos;s still at <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/HarmonicComplexity.zip">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/HarmonicComplexity.zip</a>   158KB</p><p>It&apos;s still an Excel 97 spreadsheet. Sorry. It uses features not available<br/>in 5.0/95, namely formulas longer than 255 characters. Which might explain<br/>the problems you had, Manuel, with Euler&apos;s functions.</p><p>Tenney&apos;s looks ok, log of odd-limit is passable (just as useful as<br/>odd-limit of course), Tenney&apos;s without 2&apos;s is useless (IMHO). Hahn/Op de<br/>Coul with 2&apos;s is useless.</p><p>For such a complicated algorithm Hahn/Op de Coul triangular distance only<br/>differs from log of odd-limit in a few places (e.g. 10/9, 11/9, 9/7, 9/5)<br/>where it gives a higher complexity.

Paul Hahn and I have not officially come to a final<br/>agreement on this, but Paul H. was last saying that the vectors in his<br/>algorithm have an entry for each odd number, while Manuel&apos;s have an<br/>entry for each prime number. Therefore I don&apos;t think it&apos;s right to call<br/>the latter a &quot;Hahn/Op de Coul&quot; triangular distance!!!</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/1999 3:37:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Paul H.

Since<br/>the example that accompanied his algorithm only had 3-component vectors<br/>(3,5,7), there was in fact no possible basis for deciding whether the<br/>components were to be primes or odds on the basis of that one post alone.</p><p>The problem with Hahn&apos;s intended algorithm is that it needs one additional<br/>parameter, the odd limit of the lattice, in order to be unambiguous.</p><p>If the lattice is infinite-dimensional, the metric simply yields the log of<br/>the odd-limit of the interval.</p></div>
