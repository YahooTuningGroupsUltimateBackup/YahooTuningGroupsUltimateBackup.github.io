For all practical purposes it is regarded as an abbrevation of &quot;tET&quot;.<br/>Monzo sez : &quot;the usual abbreviation for Equal Temperament.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Right, but there&apos;s no reason it can&apos;t ALSO stand for &quot;equal tuning&quot; in<br/>&gt; cases like 15-tET or 23-TET, which aren&apos;t temperaments.<br/>There is every reason why it should not !</p><p>Herman, you make an important point here, but this needs to be straightened<br/>out. Bad enough that misinformation &amp; sheer ignorance continues to persist<br/>in the general music community with regard to xenharmonics. We&apos;ve got to<br/>make sure that we atleast have reasonably unambiguous terminology.<br/>------<br/>What we have so far :</p><p>1) tET (also abbreviated to &quot;ET&quot;) - tone equal temperament<br/>2) EDO - equal divisions of the octave, covers root of 2 tunings.<br/>3) CET - cent equal temperament</p><p>- An EDO may or may not be a temperament.</p><p>- CET is specific to tunings built using equally spaced intervals measured<br/>  in 100ths of a 12EDO semitone.</p><p>- The word temperament has a very specific meaning, and so must be carefully<br/>  applied. Labeling of tunings like 7EDO as 7tET is wrong, since 7EDO is not<br/>  trying to emulate JI.</p><p>  From the Oxford dictionary :<br/>  &quot;temperament : an adjustment of intervals in tuning a piano, etc. so as to<br/>  fit the scale for use in all keys.&quot;</p><p>Is there a generic term for all tunings with equally spaced intervals ?<br/>If not, I (extremely, extremely humbly) propose &quot;ESI&quot; for equally spaced<br/>intervals. In which case, tETs, CETs, &amp; EDOs would all be ESI tunings.<br/>, as would be a whole bunch of others like 13th root of 3, 11th Root of 4/3,<br/>24th root of 3, Stria - 9 equal divisions of a 1.618:1 (golden mean)<br/>&quot;octave&quot;, etc.</p><p>-------</p><p>&gt; &quot;ET&quot; is good enough for my needs. That&apos;s all that I was trying to explain.<br/>That is the reason this needs to be cleared up. It should be made clear that<br/>the interpretation of &quot;ET&quot; as meaning &quot;equal tuning&quot; is your own personal<br/>idiosyncratic preference. Universally, ET is taken to mean &quot;equal<br/>temperament&quot; be an abbreviation of tET.</p><p>&gt; I just don&apos;t see the need to substitute &quot;EDO&quot; for<br/>&gt; &quot;ET&quot;. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with &quot;EDO&quot;, but<br/>I certainly hope others do not have this same bright idea. I don&apos;t see what<br/>&quot;equal tuning&quot; could possibly mean. It&apos;s so ambiguous it&apos;s pointless.<br/>Granted it&apos;s your own preference, so I mean no offence. I merely hope nonone<br/>else takes up such corruption of accepted standard terminology.</p><p>For the tunings you describe, EDO is a far far better &amp; infinitely more<br/>accurate term than the actually quite meaningless &quot;ET&quot; for equal tuning.</p><p>Gary is right to be concerned. Like I said, no offence, Herman, we&apos;re all<br/>friends here. But there are over 300 subscribers to this list, and the<br/>banter here eventually reaches many more ears.

William Sethares uses &quot;10-tet&quot; and &quot;11-tet&quot; in his book.

Referring to &quot;equal tunings&quot; is quite standard, as<br/>&gt; in Blackwood&apos;s _Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_ or the track<br/>&gt; descriptions on the back of his _Microtonal_ CD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Xenharmonic newbies could end<br/>&gt;&gt;up seriously confused.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This sudden proliferation of terminology is far more confusing that sticking<br/>&gt; to a single (etymologically questionable) term which served us just fine on<br/>&gt; this list for years.</p><p>Paul, chill, we can have a discussion without anyone thinking differently<br/>being seen as having a &quot;problem&quot;. Bloody weird given what we&apos;re all doing<br/>here.</p><p>As far as &quot;equal tuning&quot; being standard terminology, I don&apos;t know if it is.<br/>And what I was talking about in particular is using &quot;ET&quot; as an abbreviation<br/>for &quot;equal tuning&quot;, since it is most commonly used as an abbreviation of<br/>&quot;tET&quot;. I looked through all the entire Tuning List archives, and the only<br/>person who consistently uses the term &quot;equal tuning&quot; is you. Blackwood using<br/>it doesn&apos;t make it standard. But, yes, it could be used to refer to all<br/>tunings with equally spaced intervals, but a big problem arises when it&apos;s<br/>abbreviated to &quot;ET&quot;. Maybe if we just use &quot;equal&quot;. No abbreviation.</p><p>Thanks to increased communication, freedom, &amp; a greater confidence in<br/>challenging authority &amp; convention, the rigid rules &amp; rites of conventional<br/>music theory as espoused by academia (primarily western) are increasingly<br/>invalid. And while this list has been around for about 5 years, that is a<br/>very short time and there&apos;s just about 350 or so subscribers to the tuning<br/>list. A fraction of the musicians actually practicing the free use of pitch.</p><p>A lot more terminology will be invented and evolve as time goes by.</p><p>&gt; The work microtonal has worked well for decades now and no amount of logic<br/>&gt; will change this fact.  That people now have different understandings of the<br/>&gt; term &quot;microtonal&quot; is an interesting development, considering how little it<br/>&gt; was heard when most of the &quot;authority&quot; books were being written.</p><p>Johnny, much respect, but I do believe that in a short time the word<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; will not hold the same position it does now. You say it has<br/>worked for decades, but this is primarily within particular circles,<br/>essentially promoted by the &quot;classical&quot; music establishment, the same dolts<br/>who still say Well Temperament is 12EDO.</p><p>It is not a matter of logic, merely of being accurate.</p><p>Anyone who looks up &quot;microtone&quot; in an ordinary dictionary will see it<br/>defined as an interval smaller than a 12EDO semitone. In &quot;Twentieth Century<br/>Music : an introduction&quot;, Eric Salzman, in a passage about Partch defines<br/>microtonalism as &quot; the division of the octave into more than the<br/>conventional twelve tempered chromatic steps&quot;. The same definition is given<br/>in Daniel Politoske&apos;s &quot;Music&quot;, as does David Cope&apos;s New Directions in Music.<br/>So, it appears that the correct definition (yes it does exist for this term,<br/>since it has somewhat distinct origins) has been properly presented for a<br/>long time.</p><p>As you say, people now have different understandings of what microtonal is.<br/>Part of what is being realised is that pitch &amp; tunings can be used &amp;<br/>conjured up freely, with total disregard for conventional 12EDO-centric<br/>music theory as preached by the likes of, say, Britain&apos;s Associated Board of<br/>the Royal Schools of Music. As this realisation gets wider &amp; deeper, and<br/>draws in more musicians, the use of &quot;microtonal&quot; will change. Part of the<br/>reason &quot;microtonal&quot; is bandied about is that there is no other term widely<br/>known, the only other I know of being xenharmonics.</p><p>&gt; When I can play a different fingering for a pitch that is not<br/>&gt; conventional then it is as microtonally distant from a conventional pitch as<br/>&gt; anything smaller than a semitone is from the tonic.</p><p>But why have a reference &quot;conventional&quot; pitch ? In JI for example, there is<br/>absolutely no reason to regard any pitch as a deviation from any other.</p><p>I do see a use for &quot;microtone&quot; other than the etymological meaning. That<br/>would to refer to additional pitches used for color within a piece of music<br/>that is primarily in one particular tuning with X number of notes. This is<br/>what you too refer to above (perhaps) ? This is not me being arrogant,<br/>I see this type of use of the term very frequently, for example in<br/>descriptions of Bartok&apos;s Violin Concerto, or, as in Cope&apos;s book,<br/>Penderecki&apos;s Capriccio for Violin and Orchestra. Perhaps this is what the<br/>common use of &quot;microtone&quot; will evolve to.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s unfortunate that _xenos_ is translated as &quot;strange&quot;, as that leads to<br/>&gt; other associations in English (some of which may have well, however, been<br/>&gt; usefully applied to Ivor Darreg&apos;s music).  Other, more accurate,<br/>&gt; possibilities would be &quot;alien&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot;, but again, this leads to some<br/>&gt; negative associations.  I prefer the term &quot;unfamiliar&quot;, because it has the<br/>&gt; additional advantage of allowing one to consider the _xenharmonic_ to be a<br/>&gt; temporary classification. I trust that all of us are trying to make these<br/>&gt; tunings more familiar rather than less, and eventually one may usefully focus<br/>&gt; on a more (small c) catholic art of _harmonics_, or just plain _tuning_,<br/>&gt; absent the _xen_.</p><p>Daniel, thank you ! I could not agree more. This is what I&apos;m aiming for when<br/>I argue against labelling all tunings as &quot;microtonal&quot;. I too am<br/>uncomfortable with the _xen_ bit&apos;s negative connotations.</p><p>Eventually there will just be _music_ .</p><p>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!

Of course, the music<br/>is developing quite well right now.  When I started producing concert there<br/>was not that much repertoire, nor players to play new intervals.</p><p>Whether I am tied to a convention or you are tied to a convention, and to<br/>what degree, is hard to determine on this list.  However, my &quot;Microtonal<br/>Bach&quot; show is popular on the radio and yet, by the Salzman definition of<br/>&quot;microtonalism,&quot; my show is misnamed.  Perhaps you might contact the radio<br/>station at WKCR, classical department. :)</p><p>Drew, you have thought long and hard on this.  Others have, too.  It may be<br/>that the people who wrote so long ago giving limited definitions to what is<br/>microtonal, knew little of what they wrote.   Harvard?  Salzman?  Cope?<br/>These people did not work with the material, at least to the extent of many<br/>on this present list.  And that is understandable.</p><p>What is not understandable to me, is how a neutral third is not a microtonal<br/>interval?  What else would you call it?  Would you really care to segregate<br/>it from other &quot;smaller&quot; intervals?</p><p>Also, we have had numerous board meetings at the AFMM to try to substitute<br/>the word microtonal.
