Dave, if you mean to say<br/>what limit we begin to encounter significant tolerance effects, I would<br/>say 7.</p><p>At what limit does increasing the limit add no new &apos;independent&apos; ratios?<br/>For practical purposes, in a tonal setting, I would say 19 (in certain<br/>settings, like using complete series segments in an almost timbre-like way,<br/>maybe much higher).</p><p>I&apos;ll grant you that 19 adds only one &apos;independent&apos; ratio as far as I can<br/>tell -- 19:16.  But then, how do we define &quot;independent&quot;?  In theory,<br/>every ratio falls under a part of every other ratio&apos;s distribution...</p><p>I can live without 19, but I can&apos;t live without 17 -- it&apos;s part of some<br/>gorgeous chords, including my favorite &quot;diminished 7th&quot;.  As for 13, I<br/>can tune it by ear very quickly and to a great degree of accuracy, if<br/>I am allowed reference pitches at 12 and 14, and I can tune each of those<br/>from a single reference pitch -- any one you&apos;d like from about G2 to G5.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15540 href="#15540">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

So I<br/>suspect what really happened here was that Dave failed to express his<br/>meaning clearly. Perhaps what he really meant was, it&apos;s pushing things to<br/>say that a piece, performed on non-electronic instruments, is in such<br/>accurate 13-limit JI that it could be said that it&apos;s _not_ in 270-tET -- the<br/>two are so very close. I don&apos;t know . . . Dave Keenan needs to clarify here<br/>. . .</p><p>Anyway, the linear/non-linear distinction Dave brought up is pretty<br/>important . . . I can say that in the performance of the Scelsi solo violin<br/>piece at the Microthon, the sustained intervals were in such accurate<br/>11-limit JI (at least) that it was _not_ 72-tET, but that&apos;s only because of<br/>the non-linearities associated with intervals played on a single violin.<br/>(David Beardsley clearly misunderstood this non-linearity bit -- you could<br/>sustain an interval for years and this would have no bearing on the<br/>linearity or non-linearity with which the interval is heard.)</p></div>
