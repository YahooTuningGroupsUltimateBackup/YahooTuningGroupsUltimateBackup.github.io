It gives a poptimal generator, and is an excellent<br/>7-limit system. Apparently the natural condition of 11-limit harry is<br/>to have somewhat less well-tuned 11-limit intervals together with<br/>7-limit intervals with errors under a cent, and 202 gives us that.</p><p>Harry in the 7-limit has a generator of a slightly flattened 21/20,<br/>which in the 11-limit does duty as a 22/21 as well; 441/440 standing<br/>in something of the role that 225/224 does with miracle. It has a CE<br/>scale of 58 notes, which is not beyond the range of possibilities of a<br/>quasi-Partchian ensemble. I&apos;m not suggesting harry is the best way of<br/>tempering Genesis, miracle being an obvious and strong alternative,<br/>but it&apos;s an interesting possibility; one could simply use 202-equal<br/>and there you are.</p><p>The 7-limit TM basis for harry, incidentally, is 2401/2400 and<br/>19683/19600; the second comma differs from 225/224 by 4375/4374.</p></div><h3><a id=53325 href="#53325">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2004 3:21:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It has a CE<br/>&gt; scale of 58 notes,</p><p>What&apos;s CE?</p><p>&gt; which is not beyond the range of possibilities of a<br/>&gt; quasi-Partchian ensemble.

If I add a 126/125,<br/>176/175 or 896/891 to a comma basis of harry, I get commas for<br/>Fokker blocks leading to 58 notes to the octave, which we could also<br/>compare to Genesis if we want to go that route. I still like using<br/>58 notes of 202 equal pretty well. It has a Graham complexity of 34,<br/>which means there&apos;s plenty going on harmonically, and the 7-limit<br/>part of that is all under a cent of error, which is good stuff. Of<br/>course Studloco seems like a damned good alternative. Whether anyone<br/>would want to form a Partchian ensemble along these lines is another<br/>question.</p></div><h3><a id=53338 href="#53338">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2004 12:30:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; It suggests that&apos;s one possibility out of many.
