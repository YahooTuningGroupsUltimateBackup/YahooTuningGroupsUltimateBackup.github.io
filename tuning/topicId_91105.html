But I feel the<br/>previous versions were more elegant with the tuning interface than<br/>this version. Specifically, the bunch of accidentals lined up on the<br/>left of the common toolstrip are a sight for sore eyes. Besides, they<br/>still do not address the problem of irregular tunings and temperaments<br/>where the same accidental is made to correspond to different values<br/>for each note.</p><p>I know you will suggest duplicating the same sharp/flat symbol with a<br/>different value and name tag, but this method will just overcrowd the<br/>accidentals toolstrip column and increase the confusion during<br/>scoring. There are tunings where one can hardly remember which comma,<br/>sharp, etc... comes after a natural.</p><p>My earlier suggestion might ease things a bit: Allow the user to<br/>specify the values for every sharp/flat for EACH of the seven natural<br/>notes (C,D,E,F,G,A,B). The naturals are in turn defined in the tuning<br/>window.</p><p>Exampli gratia: Semitone sharp is made 100 cents up from C, 92 cents<br/>up from F, etc...</p><p>My recommendations for this version:</p><p>1. Reorder the sharps to the right and flats to the left of their own<br/>toolstrip which is placed beneath the common toolstrip. Reflect the<br/>seperation of flats and sharps thusly in the Accidentals Window.</p><p>2. The double sharp (tanini) symbol looks too big. Compensate for the<br/>increase in size for suchlike accidental symbols.</p><p>3. There is no need to pile up all the symbols a composer has in his<br/>arsenal for an open score that will not use all of them. Why not<br/>categorize symbols into bundles? For example, the common bundle that<br/>comes with Nihavent is Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek. I might make my own bundle<br/>named Yarman-36 and might not want them to mix together. Let the user<br/>select which bundle(s) to display in the toolstrip.</p><p>4. It would be swell if one could hear every pitch one inserts into<br/>the score as one types into the score. Can you make it so that we hear<br/>the pitch when we click-enter a note into the score?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Dr. Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Jul 17, 2010, at 4:35 PM, Utku Uzmen wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi,<br/>&gt; Since the first beta of Nihavent, the microtonal notation app, many<br/>&gt; people<br/>&gt; wrote to say they need to create their own accidentals and with<br/>&gt; version 0.6,<br/>&gt; released yesterday, this is now possible.

And afterward to audition a note by clicking on<br/>it (perhaps right-click) rather than having to use the playback<br/>shuttle for the whole score.  And to be able to select a note<br/>and drag it up or down on the staff.  The common theme here is<br/>selection of score objects, which I mentioned after the previous<br/>release also.</p><p>[snip]<br/>&gt; Besides, they still do not address the problem of irregular<br/>&gt; tunings and temperaments where the same accidental is made to<br/>&gt; correspond to different values for each note.</p><p>At the risk of being somewhat selfish, this is not a feature<br/>related to supporting regular temperaments.  And it would be<br/>comparatively complex to implement.  Therefore I suggest waiting<br/>until regular temperaments are well supported -- and until some<br/>of the other functionality expected of a WYSIWYG score editor<br/>(see above) is implemented -- to tackle this.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=91160 href="#91160">ðŸ”—</a>l99th &#x3C;utkuuzmen@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2010 7:42:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Dr. Oz and Carl for the suggestions; those are all good points.</p><p>Toolstrip changes: this was necessary because the number of accidentals is no longer fixed, so the accidental group needs to be able to extend to the right as necessary. I will probably make it at least 2 columns wide. The double sharp looks too big because it has a square aspect ratio and scales to fill the entire glyph area.</p><p>Irregular temperaments: My intention from the start was to not assume that there is a fixed number of natural notes. But I will keep this in mind. Also, in the future the value of an accidental will be displayed in the toolstrip to reduce confusion.</p><p>Auditioning notes: I agree that this will be very useful and is on the to-do list.</p><p>Tuning and accidental bundles: this can be achieved by putting all the tunings/accidentals in a (empty or otherwise) score file, and importing the score file in the Tuning and Symbols windows. In the next version a clean-up command will get rid of all unused tunings and symbols in the score.</p><p>Utku Uzmen</p></div><h3><a id=91165 href="#91165">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2010 1:26:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;l99th&quot; &lt;utkuuzmen@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Toolstrip changes: this was necessary because the number of<br/>&gt; accidentals is no longer fixed, so the accidental group needs<br/>&gt; to be able to extend to the right as necessary.
