It is, of course, possible to<br/>guide the pitch set by manipulating the shape of the object being<br/>struck, as is done with cast bells, but the mix will still contain a<br/>large set of inharmonic tones.</p><p>It is also true, from what I&apos;ve read, that real musicians don&apos;t tend to<br/>adjust their pitches toward JI any more often than they do away from JI.<br/>The biggest consistent adjustment I&apos;m aware of is to sharpen leading<br/>tones relative to 12-tET, which of course is opposite from the<br/>flattening that would be necessary to become closer to JI against the<br/>fifth degree.</p><p>And it is also true that the ear doesn&apos;t have an &quot;integer detector&quot; as<br/>such.  Still, the ear can and does distinguish between the smoother<br/>sound of an interval that is close to a low-integer ratio and the more<br/>&quot;energetic&quot; sound that is farther from a low-integer ratio (when the<br/>timbres are harmonic).  Whether or not this distinction has direct<br/>implications for how the best music might be produced is of course a<br/>separate question.</p><p>When you list the objects in nature which produce inharmonic sounds vs.<br/>the few that produce harmonic sounds, unless I missed it, you left out<br/>the human voice, which is highly harmonic (plus a little white noise).<br/>It seems to me a logical conjecture that the earliest music was a<br/>combination of inharmonic struck objects and the harmonic sound of the<br/>human voice.</p><p>When the largely-harmonic instruments produced in the last few centuries<br/>(string, reed, wind, brass, ...) are added to the percussive and voice<br/>mix, harmonicity becomes more represented than inharmonicity, and the<br/>option of exploiting the special characteristics of near-harmonic<br/>intervals becomes very feasible, though certainly not the only choice.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=725 href="#725">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2001 9:14:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Why. he said all this before and we are going in circles at this point,<br/>he believes what he believes i what i believe and we both have science<br/>behind us. i just don&apos;t have time to answer all same material over and<br/>over again.</p><p>OK  a little music history first the west did music in unison and<br/>octaves, then fifths and then something called thirds, and guess what<br/>after that they added sevenths.

THey don&apos;t know what it is they are looking at in<br/>the fiurst place</p><p>&gt; violinists do not play in just intonation, or<br/>&gt; mean-tone intonation, or Pythagorean intonation, any more than<br/>&gt; they play in equal temperament.

Instead, it brought a very different and much more<br/>&gt; interesting situation to light. It became evident, that is, that<br/>&gt; the great discrepancies always appeared where a rise or fall of<br/>&gt; the melody was clearly marked, and that, in the majority of cases,<br/>&gt; the _direction_ of the discrepancy followed the upward or downward<br/>&gt; direction of the melody. (..)</p><p>here is the very intent of the melody from which i speak</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;       &quot;But the most significant thing about the result of this<br/>&gt; experiment is the fact that it required the intervention of the<br/>&gt; measuring instrument to reveal these grotesque distortions of pitch,<br/>&gt; these false tones.</p><p>these are value judgements of the type of phenomenon  i have put forth</p><p>&gt; The audience, which included experienced<br/>&gt; musicians,<br/>&gt; had not noticed them at all.&quot; [Zuckerkandl, Victor. &quot;Sound and<br/>&gt; Symbol,&quot;<br/>&gt; Pantheon Books: New York, 1956, pp. 79-81]</p><p>of coure we don&apos;t notice them because they are a part of the language<br/>that has taken thousands of years to build up.

If you are proposing not using math as a basis how do<br/>&gt; you justify using ET&apos;s which out of all tunings [are] more<br/>&gt; mathematically based than any other type of tuning?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;JI is at least a very close appoximation to things in<br/>&gt; nature.

In what reasonable sense can one<br/>&gt; mathematical procedure be accurately described as being &quot;more<br/>&gt; mathematically based&quot; than any other mathematical procedure?<br/>&gt;       This makes no sense to me.<br/>&gt;       It is like describing broiling a steak as &quot;being more<br/>&gt; culinary&quot; than barbecuing a steak.  Both broiling and<br/>&gt; barcebuing are culinary procedures. Why is one procedure<br/>&gt; any more or less culinary than the other?<br/>&gt;       In the same way, given two different mathematical<br/>&gt; procedures which are both based in mathematics, why is<br/>&gt; one procedure any more or less based in mathematics than<br/>&gt; the other?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       In answer to your larger question, Kraig, as to<br/>&gt; how musicians justify using equal divisions of the octave...<br/>&gt;       The reason musicians use ETs is that each ET has<br/>&gt; a particular unique musical character or &quot;mood&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;overall sound,&quot; and thus each ET provides a unique<br/>&gt; set of emotional resources for music...just as each<br/>&gt; unique JI tuning has a unique set of emotional<br/>&gt; resources for music.</p><p>since according to all this scintific data on the perception of pitch ,<br/>I see none wheree listeners attempt to produce an ET like 17 or 22. The<br/>result would be far greater discrpancies than you will get from JI<br/>If the tolerance is so great it seems to me that any mood does in an ET<br/>could be done with a Cosntant structure of a JI in close approximity.</p><p>&gt; Musicians use various equal divisions<br/>&gt; of the octave for exactly the same reason they use various<br/>&gt; JI tunings...because each tuning has its own remarkable<br/>&gt; musically useful &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;mood&quot; or &quot;sonic fingerprint.&quot;</p><p>These scales only exist because of the computer and they are the<br/>easieest things to do on them. They are not something that can be tuned<br/>by ear and exstemely difficult with even a monchord.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        The claim that  &quot;JI is at least a very close<br/>&gt; appoximation to things in nature&quot; is largely false.</p><p>listen to tuvan sing.<br/>the fact is that then  we can tune it by ear and if it doesn&apos;t exist in<br/>nature how are we tuning it!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In nature, essentially ALL vibrating objects produce<br/>&gt; INHARMONIC series of vibrations, forming non-just<br/>&gt; non-equal-tempered tunings.  Almost every type of<br/>&gt; vibrating object, whether it is a glass or a spoon<br/>&gt; or a fork or a tire iron or wooden board or a CD<br/>&gt; case or champagne glass or doorknob or a metal<br/>&gt; bracelet or a ceramic tile...ALL of these types<br/>&gt; of vibrating objects produce INHARMONIC series.</p><p>add resonators at harmonic degrees and you will percieve a harmonic<br/>series</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Only a microscopic minority of exotic and exceptional<br/>&gt; vibrating objects produce HARMONIC series -- namely,<br/>&gt; objects which vibrate in one dimension only.  This<br/>&gt; set of vibrating objects is so small that it boils<br/>&gt; down to 2 exotic types *never* found in nature: thin taut<br/>&gt; strings and hollow tubes with tone holes.<br/>&gt;      ALL other types of vibrating objects produce<br/>&gt; INHARMONIC series, *not* harmonic series.<br/>&gt;      Accordingly the truth actually is that<br/>&gt; &quot;JI is completely out of tune with almost every<br/>&gt; kind of vibrating object in nature, except for the<br/>&gt; exotic special cases of thin strings and hollow tubes.&quot;</p><p>our basic instruments or the ones that human beings have chaosen to make<br/>instruments out of.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;      That does not seem to me to be much of an<br/>&gt; argument for the purported &quot;natural&quot; or allegedly<br/>&gt; &quot;universal&quot; character of JI -- since in reality<br/>&gt; most objects found in nature (rocks, tree branches,<br/>&gt; quartz crystals, slabs of ice, etc.) vibrate<br/>&gt; inharmonically producing non-just non-equal-tempered<br/>&gt; modes of vibration.<br/>&gt;       This basic fact is known as Weyl&apos;s Law of<br/>&gt; Acoustics. It is one of the basic principles of<br/>&gt; physical acoustics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     As far as dealing with long meters, counting<br/>&gt; does not involve math -- you can count the beats<br/>&gt; in a long meter by beating your fist and after<br/>&gt; a while you will simply get used to the downbeat.</p><p>In Ethnomusicaology thety have a system of measurement equivalent to<br/>cents for rhythmn. All the test finds the same thing it does with pitch.<br/>the beats are not equal nor are the subdivions of even the simpliest of<br/>rhythm patterns. So you should encourge everyone to dispell of the even<br/>beat because it doen&apos;t exist.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is not math, it&apos;s muscle memory and habit.<br/>&gt; Dealing musically with long meters involves<br/>&gt; building up the muscular habits to ingrain<br/>&gt; in your sympathetic nervous system the reflex<br/>&gt; that &quot;the downbeat comes up...now!&quot;  Counting<br/>&gt; might help get you started (or it might not), but<br/>&gt; very soon counting will confuse you.  We have all<br/>&gt; been through this -- once your muscle memory<br/>&gt; takes over in musical peformance, trying to count<br/>&gt; makes you stumble and fumble.  You have to *feel*<br/>&gt; where the beat is, not count your way to it.</p><p>It is pattern recognition</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     This applies in my experience also with<br/>&gt; complex polyrhythms, which Bill Wesley has taught<br/>&gt; me to produce on his mbira. (Bill can teach anyone<br/>&gt; complex polyrthms, and quickly too.) Counting gets in<br/>&gt; the way. You have to do it until you feel it. Soon<br/>&gt; you just feel whether the downbeat it...you<br/>&gt; feel the polyrhythm as a single thing, not<br/>&gt; some complicated piece of math.</p><p>you can feel it because we have sinple relationship ingrained as<br/>gestalts.<br/>If it was there , how could you feel it</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     In fact, Bill Wesley has pointed out that<br/>&gt; the biggest goddamn problem in producing a<br/>&gt; polyrhythm (one rhythm with one hand, one rhythm<br/>&gt; with another hand) is getting your blasted<br/>&gt; frontal lobes to SHUT UP AND STOP COUNTING<br/>&gt; so you can just settle down and live the<br/>&gt; experience. Once you live the polyrhythm, you<br/>&gt; know it and you can feel it and you can do it.<br/>&gt;     That&apos;s the point at which you become<br/>&gt; fluent.<br/>&gt;     Math has its place in various human<br/>&gt; activites, notably when playing blackjack...<br/>&gt; but in musical performance, in my experience,<br/>&gt; math is a disaster. It&apos;s almost as bad as<br/>&gt; the old dreaded &quot;You must NOT play a SINGLE<br/>&gt; wrong note!!!&quot; from the psycho music teacher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Later on Kraig Grady pointed out with typical<br/>&gt; insight:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &quot;The whole Sethares thing is interesting in<br/>&gt; that one can tune according to the timbre, but<br/>&gt; why then does 12 ET work so well with so many<br/>&gt; different timbres? Personally I want a tuning<br/>&gt; where I can use many different timbres but why<br/>&gt; certain things work and others don&apos;t is a mystery.<br/>&gt; The use of convential instruments bothers me at<br/>&gt; times because these instruments evolved  along<br/>&gt; with the tuning and the the slight modifications<br/>&gt; in their structure were not done with certain intervals<br/>&gt; in mind. I can listen to strings do any Pythagorean out<br/>&gt; to the moon but higher limit JI? Well, I could do without<br/>&gt; the Partch Viola and trade it in for a rebab any day.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Partch&apos;s use of inharmonic percussive timbres for<br/>&gt; most of his instruments (exceptions: the chromelodeon<br/>&gt; and the harmonic canon and the adapted viola) negates<br/>&gt; most of Partch&apos;s claims about the smoothness and beatlessness<br/>&gt; of JI intervals.<br/>&gt;    Yet the fact that Partch used inharmonic percussive<br/>&gt; timbres (which are totally UNmatched to the JI tuning<br/>&gt; he uses) does not detract from Partch&apos;s music. On the<br/>&gt; contrary -- Partch&apos;s use of inharmonic percussive timbres<br/>&gt; immeasurably adds to his music. Those exotic timbres seem<br/>&gt; integral to his music, they&apos;re an indispensble part of<br/>&gt; his music.</p><p>Yes you can use JI for inharmonic timbres but the opposite does not<br/>work.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    This points out how the theoretically plausible idea<br/>&gt; of matching timbre to tuning often breaks down in<br/>&gt; real music in the real world.<br/>&gt;    See my paper &quot;Tone-Color, Time Domain, Timbre,<br/>&gt; Tuning&quot; for an explanation of the reasons why Bill<br/>&gt; Sethares&apos;/John Pierce&apos;s/James Dashow&apos;s methods encounter<br/>&gt; significant limitations in real music in the real world.<br/>&gt; Bill Sethares&apos; adaptation of John R. Pierce&apos;s and James<br/>&gt; Dashow&apos;s ideas can prove musically useful depending on the<br/>&gt; circumstances, but in the real world matching timbre to<br/>&gt; tuning isn&apos;t a magic bullet...and depending on the style<br/>&gt; of the music, matching timbre to tuning may have little or<br/>&gt; no musical effect.</p><p>a linited effect at best i will agree</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The most important reason is that melody proves far<br/>&gt; more important in music than harmony,</p><p>totally agree with this</p><p>&gt; and Bill Sethares&apos;/<br/>&gt; John Pierce&apos;s/James Dashow&apos;s timbre-matching process does<br/>&gt; nothing to change melodic intervals. And since harmonic<br/>&gt; progressions derive most of their musical effect from the<br/>&gt; melodic root movement of the chords, making harmonies<br/>&gt; beatless does not change the overall fact that the roots of<br/>&gt; the chords may still move by intervals which are too<br/>&gt; melodically distorted to function as conclusive cadences.<br/>&gt;     However, many other subsidiary reasons combine to<br/>&gt; render the Pierce/Dashow/Sethares timbre-matching procedure<br/>&gt; less effective in the real world than you might suppose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Kraig Grady went on to mention:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    &quot;Sometimes the only way to make progress is to regress backward to<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; previous step and start from there. Partch felt the need to go back to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the Greeks, an extreme but possibly making it easier for margo to go<br/>&gt; back 700 years.&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     In the 21st century, the concept of musical &quot;progress&quot; (so-called)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; seems like something we have had to give up.  We have witnessed two<br/>&gt; centuries of what got called musical &quot;progress&quot; only to wind up in<br/>&gt; a situation where now, pretty much everything goes.  All styles<br/>&gt; coexist<br/>&gt; today.  The musical past coexists today with futurist musical projects<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; like real-time computer music or fractal-generated interactive<br/>&gt; MIDI synth duets, etc.<br/>&gt;     Nowadays, almost all the former &quot;avant-garde&quot; composers like<br/>&gt; Penderecki have abandoned their modernist muiscal style for tonal<br/>&gt; relatively diatonic musical styles typical of European music<br/>&gt; written in the 1920s or 1930s.<br/>&gt;     Today, there seems no longer to exist any such thing as a<br/>&gt; musical &quot;avant garde.&quot;  There&apos;s no longer any place to go in<br/>&gt; advance of the public -- there is no musical vanguard, because<br/>&gt; some 14-year-old kid with Csound on his home computer has<br/>&gt; already gotten there first.<br/>&gt;     Such concepts as a musical vanguard and a musical avant garde<br/>&gt; presupposed conditions in which cutting-edge musical knowledge was<br/>&gt; limited to an elite.  The very idea of a musical vanguard<br/>&gt; seems to derive from the axiom that only certain large institutions<br/>&gt; or certain enclaves of special individuals have gathered the<br/>&gt; expertise or the technology necessary to advance to the &quot;next<br/>&gt; level&quot; of musical practice.<br/>&gt;      Today, anyone has access to an unlimited range of<br/>&gt; musical expertise and knowledge courtesy of modern media.<br/>&gt; Whereas wannabe-avant-garde composers had to study with<br/>&gt; Nadia Boulanger during the 20th century, today wannabe<br/>&gt; modern musicians can use the wealth of CDs and videotapes and<br/>&gt; documentaries along with the internet to network with others<br/>&gt; and gain access to other people with special expertise in<br/>&gt; new music.<br/>&gt;      Moreover there is today no longer any sign of unexplored<br/>&gt; advanced realms of musical practice the knowledge of which<br/>&gt; is restricted to some elite musical priesthood.   In the 1950s<br/>&gt; and 1960s, if you wanted to electronic tape music you had<br/>&gt; to study at Columbia-Princeton or Darmstadt. In the 1960s<br/>&gt; if you wanted to do computer music you had to go to Bell<br/>&gt; Labs, or, a little later, to Stanford University. And so on.<br/>&gt;      Today, any eager composer who wants to do even the most<br/>&gt; exotic electronic music using even the most state-of-the-art<br/>&gt; algorithms merely has to scour the web for shareware. Csound<br/>&gt; today represents the tip of the iceberg...huge numbers of<br/>&gt; grad students and interested bystanders now create exotic<br/>&gt; compositional and timbre-generating computer music programs<br/>&gt; available for free. Software from the Bourges competition<br/>&gt; nowadays typically gets dumped on the web as freeware, or<br/>&gt; at most as shareware.<br/>&gt;     But the most important issue today involves the fact<br/>&gt; that there no longer exists any obvious historical direction for<br/>&gt; music to go in.  In the 1910s, there were certain things<br/>&gt; composers had not yet done -- large tone clusters for<br/>&gt; orchestra, extended performance techniques, etc.  Composers<br/>&gt; explored these musical resources and made them a part of<br/>&gt; the general Western symphonic &quot;language.&quot;  In the 1920s<br/>&gt; there were certain other things composers had not yet done --<br/>&gt; using all 12 chromatic pitches in ways that did not emphasize<br/>&gt; any specific tonal center. Composers did that and moved on.<br/>&gt; In the 1930s there were certain other things composers had<br/>&gt; never done -- using electronics and tape recorders and<br/>&gt; recording phonographs and oscillators.  During the 1930s<br/>&gt; and 1940s and into the early 1950s, composers did that too.<br/>&gt; In the 1950s, there were still certain things composers<br/>&gt; had not done -- composing music by pure chance operations,<br/>&gt; or by physically modifying Western instruments by placing<br/>&gt; paper in the strings of a harp, or nuts and bolts in the<br/>&gt; strings of a piano.  Composers did that too.<br/>&gt;    In the 1960s there were still a few things composers<br/>&gt; had not yet done -- specifying complex soundwaves directly<br/>&gt; by computer, or using electronic synthesizers to generate<br/>&gt; gestural music, or to produce more complex rhythms or<br/>&gt; tempo streams than could be attained by human performers.<br/>&gt; Composers did that too.<br/>&gt;     By around 1970, it seems fair to say that composers<br/>&gt; had run out of things they hadn&apos;t done yet.  Microtonality<br/>&gt; had been done -- Partch and Haba, Carrillo and Vyshegradsky,<br/>&gt; Fokker and Darreg, Mantle Hood&apos;s and Lou Harrison&apos;s American<br/>&gt; gamelans.  Much remained to be done with various specific<br/>&gt; tunings (whether JI or ET or NJ NET), but by 1970 microtonality<br/>&gt; had just become one among many musical options. It was no<br/>&gt; longer shocking or daring or startling.<br/>&gt;     By around 1970 creating music by flipping coins or<br/>&gt; by programming a computer had been done and was no longer<br/>&gt; any kind of &quot;vanguard.&quot;  Tape music, atonality, aleatoric<br/>&gt; music, synthesizers, oscillators, ring modulators,<br/>&gt; extended performance techniques, home-built instruments,<br/>&gt; modified orchestral instruments (i.e., nuts and bolts<br/>&gt; in the piano strings, or paper in the harp strings)...<br/>&gt; By around 1970 this stuff had all been done, and done<br/>&gt; often enough in new music circles that no serious<br/>&gt; person truly thought any of this stuff was any kind of daring<br/>&gt; new breakthrough.<br/>&gt;     So by 1970, pretty much everything that could be done in<br/>&gt; music, in broad general terms, had been done.  I&apos;m talking<br/>&gt; outlines here. Specific details still had not been filled<br/>&gt; in -- by 1970 people had built their own gamelans and some<br/>&gt; folks in America had tuned them to &quot;authentic&quot; Javanese<br/>&gt; tunings, while other Americans had built &amp; tuned other<br/>&gt; gamelans to JI.  There remain an infinite variety of JI<br/>&gt; tunings or NJ NET &quot;authentic&quot; Javanese tunings to explore,<br/>&gt; and vast amounts of music yet to write for such American<br/>&gt; gamelans. But in broad outline, the idea of either a JI<br/>&gt; gamelan or an &quot;authentic&quot; Javanese-style American gamelan<br/>&gt; no longer strikes any informed person as new or startling<br/>&gt; or &quot;avant garde.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Likewise, interested composers can now apply an infinite<br/>&gt; variety of algorithms and computer models to the task of<br/>&gt; generating music by computer. That work remains, and will<br/>&gt; continue.  But in rboad outline, the idea of generating<br/>&gt; music via computer no longer strikes any informed person<br/>&gt; as new or startling or &quot;avant garde.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Ditto atonality.  People who adore the idea of serial<br/>&gt; rows have vast new realms to explore in the anti-tonal<br/>&gt; non-cadential ET tunings like 8 or 11 or 13 or 16 equal.<br/>&gt; Likewise, even in 12 equal, there remain a vast range of<br/>&gt; mathematical schemes to apply in order to get atonal<br/>&gt; methods of composition.  But in broad outline, the idea<br/>&gt; of using some method (whether Babbitt&apos;s pitch-class<br/>&gt; matrices, or Boulez&apos;s idiosyncratic numerical systems,<br/>&gt; or Schoenberg&apos;s tone rows, or Elliott Carter&apos;s metric<br/>&gt; modulation schemes) no longer strikes any informed person<br/>&gt; as new or startling or &quot;avant garde.&quot;<br/>&gt;     So wherever you look in music today, there seems no<br/>&gt; &quot;avant garde&quot; left.  Everything, in broad outline, has<br/>&gt; been done. If it&apos;s musically possible, someone n the<br/>&gt; 20th century did it -- probably a bunch of people in<br/>&gt; the 20th century did it. In fact, there&apos;s probably a whole<br/>&gt; musical clique doing that kind of thing, or more likely<br/>&gt; many musical cliques scattered around North America.<br/>&gt;     And yet despite this we continue to use the term<br/>&gt; &quot;avant garde&quot; to describe certain types of music.<br/>&gt;     I believe that this anachronistic usage no longer<br/>&gt; has any real bearing on the historical musical<br/>&gt; situation we find ourselves in.<br/>&gt;     We seem to have reached, in short, a point in history<br/>&gt; where the musical future and past occupy the same point<br/>&gt; at the same time.  Increasingly, non-western and American<br/>&gt; and European historical musical practices also occupy the<br/>&gt; ame point at the same time.<br/>&gt;     This means that it no longer makes any sense to speak<br/>&gt; about &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;regression&quot; in music today.  Those<br/>&gt; terms imply that musical history is a one-dimensional<br/>&gt; line with an arrow pointing backwards and an arrow pointing<br/>&gt; forwards.  The backwards-pointing arrow indicates musical<br/>&gt; practices no one uses anymore, while the forward-pointing<br/>&gt; arrow indicates musical practices no one has yet used.<br/>&gt;     But today, contemporary composers have written for<br/>&gt; harpsichords and for medieval instruments and for<br/>&gt; gamelans and for African traditional instrumnets. Composers<br/>&gt; like Margo Schulter reach back into the musical past and<br/>&gt; create new music by refracting past musical practices<br/>&gt; through today&apos;s technology and today&apos;s compositional and<br/>&gt; intontional techniques.  Likewise, other composers reach<br/>&gt; into the future and create computer music which they<br/>&gt; then combine with gamelans or other non-Western ensembles.<br/>&gt;      Today, the historical model for contemporary music<br/>&gt; (at least in America) is not a line with arrows pointing<br/>&gt; forward and back, but a 3-D gas in which millions of<br/>&gt; different musical practices collide and bounce off one<br/>&gt; another. In the 20th century up to about 1970, it was<br/>&gt; possible to talk about certain musical practices as<br/>&gt; being &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;dominant.&quot; The symphony orchestra<br/>&gt; legitimized serious new music, Western orchestral<br/>&gt; instruments (piano, violin, trombone, etc.) legitimized<br/>&gt; the musical oeuvre for both new and old music,<br/>&gt; conservatories legitimized musical expertise, and so on.<br/>&gt;       That is no longer the case.<br/>&gt;       Today large numbers of highly talented musicians<br/>&gt; emerge from out of nowhere, never having gone through<br/>&gt; a conservatory. (Some still do, of course, but the<br/>&gt; point is that it&apos;s no longer necessary.)<br/>&gt;       The CD and other technologies have knocked<br/>&gt; symphony orchestras out of the ring financially, and<br/>&gt; today most large symphony orchestras continue to survive<br/>&gt; only by spending a significant amount of time playing<br/>&gt; film scores.  However, now that Eastern Europeean<br/>&gt; orchestras have become available for film score work<br/>&gt; at much lower cost, American symphony orchestras<br/>&gt; increasingly face massive threats to their very survival.<br/>&gt; As a result, young composers have largely given up<br/>&gt; composing for the orchestra...since there is just<br/>&gt; no realistic prospect of getting a commission to<br/>&gt; write for a large orchestra.  This means that symphony<br/>&gt; orchestras have now become irrelevant to legitimizing<br/>&gt; the work of today&apos;s serious composers.<br/>&gt;       Likewise, the emergence of the computer and<br/>&gt; the digital synthesizer and home-built instruments has<br/>&gt; largely eliminated classical Western orchestral<br/>&gt; instruments as the sole means of legitimizing contemporary<br/>&gt; serious music repertoire.<br/>&gt;       This leaves no dominant or central American institutions<br/>&gt; left as the musical &quot;mainstream.&quot;  Everyone knows<br/>&gt; about the extreme age of today&apos;s average symphony<br/>&gt; audience member, but less obvious is the fact that<br/>&gt; concerts of &quot;classic rock&quot; and &quot;classic jazz&quot; all tend to<br/>&gt; use the same terminology and the same publicity and<br/>&gt; the same type of language once used to cement the<br/>&gt; sole and exclusive legitimacy of conservatories<br/>&gt; and symphony ochestras as the musical &quot;mainstream&quot;<br/>&gt; in American/Europe.<br/>&gt;       Thus, today we have scholarship dealing with<br/>&gt; authentic performances of classic jazz in the same<br/>&gt; way that we have scholarship dealing with authentic<br/>&gt; performances of a Bach concerto. Music journal<br/>&gt; articles today increasingly analyze rock songs<br/>&gt; in the way that Webern experts used to analyze<br/>&gt; Webern songs. (Sometimes this kind of minute<br/>&gt; analysis goes on in guitar magazines or pop<br/>&gt; music magazines, but the levels of scholarship<br/>&gt; are similarly high. For example, a series of recent<br/>&gt; books on groups like The Cream and Jimi Hendrix<br/>&gt; used intensive scholarship and methods of source<br/>&gt; comparison and textual analysis to discover the<br/>&gt; order in which various tracks of classic rock<br/>&gt; albums were composed. This differs only in details<br/>&gt; from the methods of scholarship used to establish<br/>&gt; authenticity of medieval musical manuscripts.)<br/>&gt;       In short, large numbers of music lovers refuse to<br/>&gt; believe in the innate cultural superiority of, say,<br/>&gt; European classical symphonic music as opposed to<br/>&gt; American fusion jazz, or &quot;classic&quot; rock, etc. There once<br/>&gt; was a time when this was not the case.  At one time,<br/>&gt; during the 1910s and 20s and 30s up through the 1940s,<br/>&gt; the most famous and well-respected musical figures in<br/>&gt; North America were people like Van Cliburn (after winning<br/>&gt; that Russian piano competition in 1957) and Leonard<br/>&gt; Bernstein (after filling in when a famous European<br/>&gt; conductor got sick).<br/>&gt;      Can anyone imagine a classical pianist becoming<br/>&gt; world-famous today because he won a Russian piano<br/>&gt; competition?  Can anyone imagine a New York conductor<br/>&gt; becoming nationally famous today because he filled in<br/>&gt; for an ailing European symphony orchestra conductor?<br/>&gt;       These things no longer happen. Our culture has<br/>&gt; simply changed. The musicians on the cover of TIME<br/>&gt; magazine nowadays are rock stars, not classical pianists<br/>&gt; or conductors of the New York Philharmonic.<br/>&gt;       However, today even the rock &apos;n roll scene has<br/>&gt; fragmented to such an extent that there are no longer<br/>&gt; any towering figures as dominant as, say, the Beatles<br/>&gt; or the Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix.  Today, in rock<br/>&gt; the megastars come and go within a matter of 18 months.<br/>&gt;       Consequently there is no longer any<br/>&gt; musical mainstream. There is no longer any<br/>&gt; dominant musical culture in America. If you<br/>&gt; turn on the radio in a large metropolitan area,<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll find a lot of top 40s AOR. If you turn<br/>&gt; on the radio in a rural area, you&apos;ll find country<br/>&gt; music is the dominant musical culture. But if<br/>&gt; you walk past student dorms at a university, you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; find rap is the dominant musical culture. Meanwhile,<br/>&gt; at the lofts or proscenia of the local new music<br/>&gt; scene modernist-sounding new instrumental music<br/>&gt; sounds like the dominant musical culture, while<br/>&gt; if you get to know the local industrial music<br/>&gt; fans, industrial music will sound like the<br/>&gt; dominant musical culture.<br/>&gt;      Despite claims to the contrary, there is<br/>&gt; no longer any genuine dominant musical culture<br/>&gt; that runs the length and breadth, from top to<br/>&gt; bottom, of American society nowadays.<br/>&gt;      Instead, many different musical cultures<br/>&gt; interpenetrate one another and blend into each<br/>&gt; other nowadays, like colors blurring into one<br/>&gt; another in a tie-dye shirt.<br/>&gt;     This makes terms like &quot;musical avant garde&quot;<br/>&gt; and musical &quot;progress&quot; and musical &quot;regression&quot;<br/>&gt; largely problematic in their meaning today.

But professional a cappella groups<br/>of free-pitched, timbre-alike instruments (choirs, brass choirs,<br/>string choirs) overwhelmingly manage to produce a closer<br/>approximation of vertical JI than 12-tET.  In Barbershop, at<br/>least, this has been repeatedly verified with spectrum analysis.<br/>Your ears will have to tell the rest.</p><p>Brian&apos;s post contains more references than that, but you&apos;ll notice<br/>he confuses vertical and horizontal JI in several places.</p><p>&gt; The biggest consistent adjustment I&apos;m aware of is to sharpen<br/>&gt; leading tones relative to 12-tET, which of course is opposite from<br/>&gt; the flattening that would be necessary to become closer to JI<br/>&gt; against the fifth degree.</p><p>But have you heard, &quot;sharpen the fifth, flatten the third&quot;?  An<br/>old adage that is taught in conservatories the world over.</p><p>&gt; And it is also true that the ear doesn&apos;t have an &quot;integer detector&quot;<br/>&gt; as such.</p><p>There is some evidence that such a detector exists in the periodicity<br/>mechanism.  The spectral mechanism doesn&apos;t care any more than the<br/>timbre.</p><p>&gt; When you list the objects in nature which produce inharmonic sounds<br/>&gt; vs. the few that produce harmonic sounds, unless I missed it, you<br/>&gt; left out the human voice, which is highly harmonic (plus a little<br/>&gt; white noise).</p><p>Brian left out all the major free-pitched instruments of western<br/>classical music, instead discussing timbres which might be of<br/>interest to composers seeking new resources, or timbres that are<br/>used in cultures whose music is not tuned precisely.  He also<br/>selectively ignores the fact that while instruments such as the<br/>piano are inharmonic, they are only slightly inharmonic.  Finally,<br/>he either ignores, or is unaware of the fact that the loudest<br/>few partials in the attack of highly inharmonic percussion<br/>instruments tend to dominate the pitch they are perceived to have,<br/>and that such pitches can be combined in harmonic proportions to<br/>generate an ersatz JI effect, as is clearly audible in the work<br/>of Harry Partch.</p><p>Don&apos;t be spoofed by Brian&apos;s &quot;factual&quot;, but highly manipulative<br/>article.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=772 href="#772">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 10:05:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>mclaren wrote...</p><p>&gt;/.../ mythical &quot;integer ratio detectors&quot; inside<br/>&gt; people&apos;s heads (which have been shown not to exist).</p><p>Not to my satisfaction, unless you&apos;ve got something I<br/>haven&apos;t seen.</p><p>On the other hand, there are at least three phenomena that<br/>would cause a reasonable person to suspect the ear/brain<br/>may be equipped with (which is not to say it &quot;boils down<br/>to&quot;) a small-ratio detector...</p><p>&#x9;[1] Folks more reliably agree on the pitch of a<br/>&#x9;complex timbre to the extent its partials are<br/>&#x9;harmonic, with the possible exception of a few<br/>&#x9;specially-designed auditory illusions that can be<br/>&#x9;created with a synthesizer but which do not occur<br/>&#x9;in acoustic musical instruments.</p><p>&#x9;[2] Intervals expressed by small integer ratios are<br/>&#x9;easier to recognize (identify) than other intervals,<br/>&#x9;unless the other interval is near in size to a small<br/>&#x9;integer ratio, _in which case it takes on the quality<br/>&#x9;of the nearby small-integer-ratio interval_.  This<br/>&#x9;was observed by Harry Partch (&quot;field of attraction&quot;),<br/>&#x9;explains why musicians tend to use temperaments whose<br/>&#x9;irrational intervals approximate JI, and has survived<br/>&#x9;peer review on the tuning list (in this case, at<br/>&#x9;least as good as a vanilla scientific paper).</p><p>&#x9;Another possible explanation of this phenomenon is by<br/>&#x9;appeal to a cultural accident that occurred in Europe<br/>&#x9;and spread around the world with the rest of European<br/>&#x9;culture.

AIC is higher for random noise than most<br/>&gt; music, etc.  Can you give a reference?</p><p>I&apos;ll have to dig up my Information Theory textbook.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; And to continue<br/>&gt; in this context, minimal music has less information content per<br/>&gt; minute, but is meant to be listened to in a state of mind when<br/>&gt; minutes are faster.  In general, it is the pleasant effect of<br/>&gt; this state of mind that makes such music great (I like it too!),<br/>&gt; but it isn&apos;t hard to fire such music out... all the stuff about<br/>&gt; special intervals is hocus pocus, IMO.</p><p>All what stuff about special intervals?</p></div>
