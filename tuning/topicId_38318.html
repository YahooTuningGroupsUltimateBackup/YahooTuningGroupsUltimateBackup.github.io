Here are some quick thoughts:</p><p>1. Most human beings are incredibly square and conservative, unwilling to try change.</p><p>2. People who do a lot of notation are probably more schooled and more academic, and less likely to be adventurous (and probably think there isn&apos;t anything wrong at all with 12tet).</p><p>3.

Actually I think there are *more and more* micro<br/>composers using composing software... people like John Eaton, Alison<br/>here on this forum, Kyle Gann, Frank Oteri...  All trying to use<br/>Sibelius for microtonal notation of one kind or another.</p><p>And I think there were a whole *bunch* of people doing that with<br/>Finale, including David Doty, your &quot;favorite&quot; &quot;nutty professor&quot;...<br/>who will remain unnamed, unfavorite and unnutty if you prefer...  and<br/>probably others in schools now who are using at *least* quartertones.</p><p>Sibelius does quartertones just fine... well it requires a *plug in*<br/>so it&apos;s not *fully* implemented, but they are clearly aware of the<br/>importance of having them.</p><p>And the good news is that I *can* get my work done in the software,<br/>which is the important part.  I only need to use the Ted Mook<br/>PostScript symbols for 72-tET and pitch bends, which I have to enter<br/>in manually.</p><p>Although I have not written *privately* to the company, they *have*<br/>responded to me on the forum site that they *have* been at least<br/>*considering* implementing the Sims 72-tET accidentals in future<br/>releases.</p><p>Of course, their *standard* line is &quot;it&apos;s being considered for a<br/>future release&quot; so I could be tripping over my beard before that will<br/>happen...</p><p>Joe</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 2:02:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>jpehrson2 wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m constantly getting *shot down* on the Sibelius forum site when I<br/>&gt; mention the desire for anything other than quartertones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does this really mean that composers, in general, are not *ready* for<br/>&gt; microtonality, except for quartertones????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph</p><p>Yes.</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/2002 2:07:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>jpehrson2 wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38321">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38321</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3.
