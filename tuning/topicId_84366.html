The same wave laws apply to the vibrating strings and pipes that create the sound, to the medium which carries it, to the speaker that recreates it, to the synths that imitate it, and we can safely assume in the basilica membrane which &apos;hears&apos; it in some form of one-one correspondence. Furthermore, everywhere Fourier Analysis or waves make an appearance in any scientific theory whatsoever it is present, and even our eyes will confirm it when the waves are plotted. Flick through the pages of any science text or book on differential equations and it is there. The same basic laws also apply to light and electromagnetism and even to the elementary wave-particles of matter. And historically speaking musical harmony was the first science, its trace evidence being found in the very representation of the world in numbers. So against the backdrop of this bigger scientific picture, it is entirely possible - and I&apos;m only saying possible mind you - that psychoacoustics perhaps got lost in some of the small details, that they forgot to look at the outside view from time to time. This doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re stupid because, as you said yourself, &quot;you can&apos;t expect everyone to know everything&quot;, and 50 years is not long in the scheme of things.

The 440 that i can hear though does change in volume depending which makes me think it is not in the C sound code but was hoping we could get someone to look just to be sure. The volume is loud and maybe there is someway to overdrive the info to get this. I am interested in case there is a unique condition in which the GCD comes out for some reason.<br/>--</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2009 1:12:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>here is the file rick sent me<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/GCDaudioA440Hz.mp3">http://anaphoria.com/GCDaudioA440Hz.mp3</a><br/>i used both a low pass filter and tried a high cut filter from the one i have in logic 7. i had to go down to 210 before i could get this 440 residue.
