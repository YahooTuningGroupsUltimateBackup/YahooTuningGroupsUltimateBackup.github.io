I&apos;m still<br/>working on mapping pieces to 31-tET for purposes of grounding to MORE<br/>than 12 notes in some (early) works.  That effort is proving a bit of<br/>a challenge, but more on that later!</p><p>I&apos;m liking this refinement a lot, especially on some Mozart piano works<br/>I&apos;ve recently downloaded.  Once the ear syncs in on the COFT-centered<br/>values, the small deviations from those values needed for dynamic<br/>tuning seem relatively painless, and the resultant chords are very<br/>sweet.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=10346 href="#10346">ðŸ”—</a>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@teleport.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2000 10:23:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Maybe I&apos;m missing something, or maybe my equipment isn&apos;t reproducing your<br/>MIDI as you have coded it, but ... well, I just don&apos;t hear a very dramatic<br/>difference between the three versions.

I feel that this version represents a major advance<br/>in the field of tuning Bach. The JI quality of the chords is quite evident,<br/>yet all audible traces of drifts and shifts have been eliminated. One<br/>readily believes that the piece was played on a fixed-pitch keyboard, yet it<br/>would be impossible to approach this level of smoothness in a true<br/>fixed-pitch rendition. People like Johnny Reinhard, who have dismissed the<br/>idea of JI Bach, need to listen to this version! Bravo!

It<br/>seems to be a brief description of what compression IS, then a<br/>description of how to use the compression feature in Cakewalk.</p><p>I don&apos;t have Cakewalk, but as far as I can tell from this page, it only<br/>compresses note velocity.  What really needs to be done is a bit more<br/>complex, and represents a weakness in my existing tuning program: many<br/>sequences begin life on different channels, each with its own channel<br/>volume, perhaps one for the left hand, one for the right hand, for<br/>example.  Because I use pitch bends, I need to reshuffle the channel<br/>assignments, and a C from the left hand joins a C from the right hand on<br/>channel 0, etc.  That channel can have only one channel volume!  So,<br/>whatever channel volume I assign to the final sequence, I need to adjust<br/>the note velocities when notes came from an original channel with a<br/>different volume!  What a mess!</p><p>And, channel volume is an important part of a complete compression<br/>process, especially when a sequence uses varying volume in addition to<br/>varying note velocities.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
