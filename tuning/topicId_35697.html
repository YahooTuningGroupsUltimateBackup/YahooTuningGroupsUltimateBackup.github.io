It&apos;s two<br/>&gt; entirely different sound worlds.</p><p>The difference between the synthetized waveform and its original counterpart<br/>is generally irrelevant. It is possible to make &quot;fine synthesis&quot; of short<br/>phrases by making the natural speech and synthesis speech look alike (on<br/>sonogram) and sound alike (to the point that nobody can tell which one is<br/>natural, and to the point that most people can not tell they are different).<br/>Even in this case, the waveforms are totally different. Waveform difference,<br/>in this case, is due too a poor phase modeling in the synthetic speech. This<br/>phase difference between natural and synthesis is not perceptually relevant.</p><p>Phase is perceptually relevant for tone with sharp attack such as<br/>percussions or plucked string. Early digital recording material (e.g. Sony&apos;s<br/>PCM F1) was poor at phase rendering, thus sharp attacks were downright<br/>hideous in spite of a flat frequency response.</p><p>But for continuous sound, or sound with smoother transition (like speech),<br/>phase has little importance.</p><p>yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div><h3><a id=35700 href="#35700">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2002 1:02:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., LAFERRIERE Fran&ccedil;ois &lt;francois.laferriere@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; But for continuous sound, or sound with smoother transition (like<br/>speech),<br/>&gt; phase has little importance.</p><p>this is a very important point. some people spend too much time<br/>looking at waveforms and searching for &apos;deep meaning&apos; therein.<br/>unfortunately looking at waveforms is a very poor sensory analogy for<br/>how our ears hear sound. i think it&apos;s much more important to focus on<br/>what we can actually hear.</p></div><h3><a id=35734 href="#35734">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2002 9:26:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/18/02 6:10 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 14<br/>&gt;  Date: Mon, 18 Mar 2002 21:54:16 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jacky_ligon@yahoo.com">jacky_ligon@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: For Gerald Eskelin: Timbre of Singing (was Re: Jerri es: a conclusion<br/>&gt; or two)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In tuning@y..., LAFERRIERE Fran&ccedil;ois &lt;francois.laferriere@c...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; But for continuous sound, or sound with smoother transition (like speech),<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; phase has little importance.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; this is a very important point. some people spend too much time<br/>&gt;&gt; looking at waveforms and searching for &apos;deep meaning&apos; therein.<br/>&gt;&gt; unfortunately looking at waveforms is a very poor sensory analogy for<br/>&gt;&gt; how our ears hear sound. i think it&apos;s much more important to focus on<br/>&gt;&gt; what we can actually hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you had logged in as many hundreds of hours as I have over the<br/>&gt; years recording and coaching vocalists in a real world musical<br/>&gt; environment, you would likely not be so presumptuous as to think that<br/>&gt; what I&apos;m saying here is not based on *hearing*. This is not the first<br/>&gt; time that you have made such off the mark assumptions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you frequently recommend to others, I suggest for you to go back<br/>&gt; and read what I wrote.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I maintain that from 22 years of experience with sound synthesis and<br/>&gt; vocal recording, that these are two entirely different things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This &quot;deep meaning&quot; is the voice of experience. I would humbly<br/>&gt; suggest that you might benefit from learning a little bit of respect<br/>&gt; for it - since I&apos;m not convinced that you have logged in the hundreds<br/>&gt; of hours doing it that I have. Obviously if you are getting folks to<br/>&gt; make tuning judgements about singing based on synthesized timbres,<br/>&gt; then it is my feeling that you&apos;ve got much to learn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hearing and making music is what I do much more than hanging out on<br/>&gt; these chat rooms wasting years of valuable time. Join me, and you<br/>&gt; might begin to get some music completed. I know that there&apos;s over 580<br/>&gt; folks in this forum that&apos;d like to *hear* your &quot;theory&quot; that we only<br/>&gt; *see*, live in acutal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the &quot;deep meaning&quot; I hope to one day *hear* from you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L</p><p>Jacky, I suggest you take another look at Paul&apos;s post. Your thin-skinned<br/>reaction is quite unwarranted, in my opinion. Paul didn&apos;t say or imply that<br/>what you had to say is &quot;not based on *hearing*.&quot; On the contrary, he is<br/>making the point that focusing on &quot;what we can actually hear&quot; is important.<br/>He appears to be agreeing with you that &quot;phase has little importance.&quot; Read<br/>the exchange again. I think you&apos;ll agree.</p><p>I&apos;m taking the time to respond here because I, too, used to &quot;react&quot; to<br/>Paul&apos;s sometimes abrupt and to-the-point comments. Over the months I&apos;ve<br/>learned to absorb (read: ignore) those impulses. I&apos;ve found it better to<br/>request clarification (as I did in an earlier post today) instead of blowing<br/>steam. It really works out better for me. Perhaps you will find it does for<br/>you, too.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=35759 href="#35759">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 12:42:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 3/18/02 6:10 PM, &quot;tuning@y...&quot; &lt;tuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Message: 14<br/>&gt; &gt;  Date: Mon, 18 Mar 2002 21:54:16 -0000<br/>&gt; &gt;  From: &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: For Gerald Eskelin: Timbre of Singing (was Re: Jerri es:<br/>a conclusion<br/>&gt; &gt; or two)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In tuning@y..., LAFERRIERE Fran&ccedil;ois<br/>&lt;francois.laferriere@c...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But for continuous sound, or sound with smoother transition<br/>(like speech),<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; phase has little importance.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; this is a very important point. some people spend too much time<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; looking at waveforms and searching for &apos;deep meaning&apos; therein.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; unfortunately looking at waveforms is a very poor sensory<br/>analogy for<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; how our ears hear sound. i think it&apos;s much more important to<br/>focus on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; what we can actually hear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you had logged in as many hundreds of hours as I have over the<br/>&gt; &gt; years recording and coaching vocalists in a real world musical<br/>&gt; &gt; environment, you would likely not be so presumptuous as to think<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; what I&apos;m saying here is not based on *hearing*.
