You<br/>&gt;&gt;mentioned Korg. Of korg synths the best bet would be a Z1 [physical<br/>&gt;&gt;modeling synth] as it allows full midi retuning [i.e you can assign any<br/>&gt;&gt;pitch to any midi note no.] 1cent resolution.</p><p>Joel wrote:</p><p>&lt; Really? Can you &quot;retune&quot; it from the front panel also? or does it need to be in<br/>an external<br/>software sequencer orso? with sys-ex, or something. &gt;</p><p>I&apos;m not sure. But I doubt you could sucessfully retune it from the front panel. I have yet to come across a synth that could do this easily. I think the World Music menu [a software scale editor] supports it and I&apos;m sure Scala could do it. If I were you the the best bet would be the new Emu Proteus 2000 or one of the Ensoniq samplers as they are the easiest to microtune or a second hand Dx7IIFD. Something like this and an easy to use scale editor JICalc for the Mac, WMM, or Justonics Pitch Palette for the PC would be your easiest entry into Just Intonation and unfamiliar tunings.</p><p>Justin</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>.</p></div>
