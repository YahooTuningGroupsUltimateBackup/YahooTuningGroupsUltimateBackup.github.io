I had email recently about registry<br/>data for something, which I think might have been AC, but in getting<br/>rid of a virus I accidentally nuked my saved email. Meanwhile I had<br/>old email about this, but seem to have saved the wrong file. Registry<br/>data may be in the Windows directory on my old disk; if anyone knows<br/>where that would be exactly, and if it can be copied from an old W98<br/>install to a W2K, that would help.</p><p>Of course if anyone knows what the heck happened with AC it would be<br/>nice. I&apos;m not too concerned because AC has been lagging anyway, and<br/>Timidity now seems to be better, but I&apos;d like to know. Any other AC<br/>users out there?</p></div>
