I thought it would be prudent to post<br/>this message, to give a balanced view of my opinions on<br/>notational inconsistency.</p><p>I&apos;ve stated here before that I stumbled upon prime-factor<br/>notation and lattices on my own, without knowing about the<br/>work of Fokker, Wilson, and others previous to me.</p><p>My &apos;invention&apos; of prime-factor notation stemmed from my<br/>dissatisfaction with the inconsistency in Ben Johnston&apos;s<br/>notation.  I&apos;ve always felt that Johnston&apos;s system is a good<br/>compact and accurate JI notation, but his basic scale is<br/>the &apos;usual&apos; 5-limit JI &apos;major&apos; scale, which uses two different<br/>prime-factors (3 &amp; 5, ignoring 2), and this is a problem, IMO.</p><p>As Daniel Wolf has pointed out (in private communication),<br/>this causes anyone reading Johnston&apos;s notation to have to<br/>perform a two-step mental process to decode the intervallic<br/>relationships in the music.</p><p>This is avoided by using a notation based strictly on prime<br/>factors, which is a one-step mental process.  (Wolf has<br/>designed one himself, published in a letter in _1/1_). [*]</p><p>The point, as far as this posting goes, is that altho I think<br/>Johnston&apos;s notation has its merits, it also has a whole series<br/>of inconsistencies (in the Erlichean sense) because of its<br/>two-factor basis.  So even tho each of the primes above 5 is<br/>indicated consistently by its own symbol, the plus and minus<br/>signs used for factor 5 itself vary, based on a particular<br/>note&apos;s relationship to the reference &apos;major&apos; scale.</p><p>For example,<br/>if we&apos;re in the key of &apos;C&apos;, then F:C, C:G, and G:D all indicate<br/>&apos;perfect 5ths&apos; of 3:2 ratio.  However, because &apos;A&apos; (without<br/>any other &apos;accidentals&apos;) is designated as the 5:4 of &apos;F&apos;<br/>(i.e, 5:3), the notes D:A indicate not a 3:2 &apos;perfect 5th&apos;,<br/>but rather a 40:27 &apos;5th&apos; lowered by a comma.  The &apos;perfect 5th&apos;<br/>from &apos;D&apos; would be notated as D:A+, which I see as a distinct<br/>disadvantage.</p><p>I point this out because, first of all, Johnston&apos;s notation<br/>seems to become increasingly popular for JI scores and musical<br/>examples in articles, and I think this is unfortunate - if<br/>prime-factor the way I use it is too cumbersome, then certainly Wolf&apos;s<br/>notation is far preferable; secondly, as I said above,<br/>I wanted to give a balanced view of my own feelings on the issue<br/>of notational inconsistency.</p><p>However, I still feel that it&apos;s not that much of an issue when<br/>using an ET notation to convey a JI intention, probably<br/>because ETs have their own consistencies apart from their<br/>rational implications.  Perhaps the reason it bothers me so much<br/>in Johnston&apos;s case is simply because Johnston&apos;s notation *does*<br/>give absolute rational accuracy.</p><p>-monz</p><p>[*] _1/1_, v 9 #3 (summer 1996), &apos;Correspondence&apos;, p 15.<br/>Wolf uses pairs of symbols, similarly to Johnston, but with<br/>the first and second symbol of each pair representing<br/>p^1 and p^-1 respectively, where &apos;p&apos; is a prime-factor<br/>from 5 thru 23.</p><p>His symbols for 5, 7, and 11 are very much like both Johnston&apos;s<br/>and my adaptation of Sims/Herf 72-eq, which makes all three<br/>systems virtually synonomous for 11-limit music, excepting<br/>the variant meanings of Johnston&apos;s +/- signs, as noted above.<br/>Wolf&apos;s symbols for 13, 17, 19, and 23 are unique (as far as<br/>I know).</p><p>Wolf told me he learned prime-factor notation from Erv Wilson,<br/>but I&apos;m only familiar with Wilson&apos;s keyboard &apos;modulus&apos; notations<br/>- I&apos;ve never seen any of his prime-factor notations.<br/>Perhaps a Wilsonite out there can give some info<br/>(Kraig Grady?  John Chalmers?  Daniel Wolf himself?).</p><p>Joseph L.

Perhaps &apos;pythagorean-commatic&apos; would describe it well, in that<br/>the notation is based upon known commas and comma-like deviations from<br/>pitches in a basic pythagorean series.</p><p>As I have posted before, I have always used + and - signs for 81/80, 7 and<br/>inverted-7 signs for 63/64 and  up- and down-arrows for 33/32&apos;s.  My own<br/>use of signs for ratios of 13, 17, 19, 23 has not been consistent.</p><p>While the major virtue of such a &apos;commatic&apos; notation is the consistant<br/>spelling of intervals, this does comes at the price of some difficulty in<br/>notating more complex ratios (i.e. 11/7) and the notation, being basically<br/>pythagorean, does not always reflect melodic changes in pitch height, but<br/>these difficulties are also encountered in the alternative notation.</p></div>
