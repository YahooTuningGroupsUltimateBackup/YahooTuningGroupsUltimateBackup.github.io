A regular tuning is built from a chain of<br/>identically sized fifths -- or sometimes from two or more such chains<br/>(e.g. 24-tET, 51-tET). This is Dave Keenan&apos;s &quot;chain-of-fifths-tunings&quot;<br/>category, with some implication that the generator is indeed a &quot;fifth&quot;<br/>with a size somewhere between that of 7-tET and 5-tET (not to rule out<br/>greater musical latitude, a la Jacky Ligon or otherwise -- just to take<br/>note of a usual assumption).</p><p>(2) EQUITONE. An equitone is a regular tuning used in a given musical<br/>context, or in established practice, so that the regular major third<br/>is derived from four fifths up (e.g. F-A from F-C-G-D-A), and thus<br/>from two equal whole-tones, or &quot;equi-tones&quot; (e.g. F-A from F-G-A).</p><p>(3) MEANTONE. A meantone is a negative equitone (diesis negative, or<br/>12 pure fifths falling short of 7 pure octaves) where four fifths up<br/>provide the best approximation of a pure 5:4. The second condition,<br/>proposed as a criterion by Dave Keenan, sets a lower limit at around a<br/>fifth size of 691.51 cents, while either condition sets an upper limit<br/>at 700 cents (12n-tET).</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>1. All meantones are equitones -- but not vice versa<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>One very important implication of this scheme is that not all<br/>equitones are meantones: an equitone may aim at some simple or complex<br/>ratio for regular thirds other than the 5:4 and 6:5 of meantone.</p><p>In typical Gothic/neo-Gothic equitones (Pythagorean to 17-tET), for<br/>example, major thirds have complex ratios ranging from 81:64 (~407.82<br/>cents) to ~423.53 cents; this complexity fits the unstable role of<br/>these intervals, contrasting with the pure or near-pure fifths and<br/>fourths (the primary concords in this music).</p><p>In what might be termed &quot;septimal&quot; equitones or paultones around the<br/>22-tET region, regular thirds have ratios at or near 9:7 and 7:6. In<br/>addition to providing a stimulating variation for neo-Gothic music,<br/>the equitonal thirds and minor sevenths of this region could ideally<br/>fit a style treating 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 as a stable tetrad. A<br/>chain of only 4 fifths or fourths would provide all the intervals of<br/>such a sonority!</p><p>To sum up, a meantone is a special case of an equitone where regular<br/>major and minor thirds are near 5:4 and 6:5, or as you have said,<br/>Paul, a tuning which disperses the syntonic comma so as to achieve a<br/>regular structure with reasonable 5-limit approximations.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. All equitones are regular tunings, but not always vice-versa<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While all equitones are by definition regular tunings, or<br/>&quot;chain-of-fifths&quot; tunings, a given regular tuning may or may not be<br/>used in an equitonal fashion in a given musical context or setting.<br/>A few tunings may readily illustrate this point.</p><p>Consider, for example, 46-tET, a very characteristic neo-Gothic<br/>equitone with major thirds at almost precisely 14:11 (~417.51 cents).<br/>In a neo-Gothic setting, where these complex thirds are a major<br/>attraction, this temperament provides a superb diatonic scale as a<br/>kind of accentuated flavor of Pythagorean tuning. Usual note and<br/>interval spellings fit theory and practice.</p><p>If 46-tET is used as a 7-limit tuning for a guitar or &quot;srutar&quot;<br/>approximating the 22 srutis, for example, however, then it is no<br/>longer an equitone: the complex thirds of neo-Gothic style no longer<br/>define the &quot;usual&quot; intervals in use, and a more intricate approach to<br/>scale formation and mapping intervals to steps is required.[1]</p><p>The same situation holds for 22-tET, a superb equitonal realization of<br/>the diatonic scale in a neo-Gothic setting, or a posited setting where<br/>tetrads of 12:14:18:21 serve as stable concords. Regular note and<br/>interval spellings present no complications: this equitonal situation<br/>seems synonymous to me with your &quot;Pythagorean&quot; 22-tET modes, Paul.</p><p>However, in a decatonic/tetradic style based on the stable 4:5:6:7, or<br/>for that matter a Classic/Romantic 5-limit style based on 4:5:6, we<br/>have again entered a nonequitonal world, since the equitonal major<br/>third very accurately approximates 9:7 rather than 5:4.</p><p>To sum up, to describe a tuning as an &quot;equitone&quot; is to say both that<br/>it has an intrinsic regular structure (&quot;chain-of-fifths tuning&quot;), and<br/>that it is being _used_ in a &quot;regular&quot; fashion (&quot;a major third equals<br/>four fifths up&quot;). The second assumption may be very decidedly<br/>style-dependent.</p><p>Specifically, when various authors remarks that a tuning such as<br/>46-tET or 22-tET has the disadvantage of unconventional spelling, they<br/>are (often implicitly) assuming styles where major thirds should be<br/>tuned at or near 5:4 rather than 14:11 or 9:7.</p><p>While such assumptions may often be obvious enough, articulating them<br/>may make our definitions more responsive to the variety of practices.</p><p>------------------------------<br/>3. Usage: a retrospective note<br/>------------------------------</p><p>Having shared with others on this List in the process of seeking some<br/>mutually agreeable definition of &quot;meantone&quot; -- or at least one not<br/>needlessly disagreeable -- I have concluded that a focus on the<br/>approximation of 5:4 and 6:5 thirds indeed fits both history and<br/>typical current usage.</p><p>In contrast, an &quot;equitone&quot; is free to use four fifths up to attain or<br/>approximate a major third of any desired size.</p><p>The terms &quot;meantone&quot; and &quot;equitone&quot; are in one way synonymous: both<br/>point to the formation of a major third from two &quot;mean&quot; or &quot;equal&quot;<br/>whole-tones, a feature of interest from a melodic as well as vertical<br/>standpoint.</p><p>The usage and connotations of these terms, however, differs on one<br/>critical point: &quot;meantone&quot; suggests both in its origins and in its<br/>usual associations a specific concern with dispersing the syntonic<br/>comma to achieve pure or near-pure 5:4 and 6:5 thirds.</p><p>The advantage of &quot;equitone&quot; is that it does not carry this kind of<br/>baggage, but describes the &quot;two equi-tones make a major third&quot; feature<br/>of a tuning.</p><p>Also, from an historical point of view, we may find it very convenient<br/>to say, &quot;Conventional Western European notation has evolved in a<br/>setting of equitonal tunings, namely Pythagorean and meantone.&quot;[2]</p><p>We could also try out typologies like this:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Type of regular tuning      Equitonal use          Nonequitonal use<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Negative (meantone)         The norm               Likely rare<br/>                            (~5-based thirds)      (~9:7 remapping?)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Pythagorean region          Gothic/neo-Gothic      Skhismic tunings<br/>                            (complex thirds)       (5-limit or higher)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Septimal region             neo-Gothic             decatonic, etc.<br/>(22-tET/paultone)           (7-flavor thirds)      (7-limit or higher)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Anyway, maybe the &quot;equitone&quot; concept can lead to further discussion.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Following the example of others here, I would prudently add that<br/>one might wisely make a distinction between the traditional system of<br/>22 srutis in the classical music of India, and various recent systems<br/>and offshoots taking the 22-sruti tradition as an inspiration, but not<br/>necessarily based on the same intonational and stylistic framework.</p><p>2. Here Ed Foote might not be disappointed if I add that historical<br/>well-temperaments, although not equitonal, are cleverly designed so as<br/>to be compatible with basic equitonal notations even while providing a<br/>variety of transpositional colors.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
