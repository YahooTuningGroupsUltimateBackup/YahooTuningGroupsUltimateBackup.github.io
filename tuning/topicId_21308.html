Harrison has later said that part of Schoenberg&apos;s genius was<br/>&gt; to see atonality as the logical end of 12TET.</p><p>Whereas this is obviously true conceptually, I am not quite<br/>convinced that his music necessarily has to be done this way. I read<br/>somewhere the story of a singer who was totally at loss with<br/>dodecaphonic music until she learned to sing the tone rows. My<br/>interpretation of what happend is that she settled on a series of JI<br/>intervals that let her go through them without having a comma left<br/>over at the end.<br/>I have a hunch that this works very well for Sch&ouml;nberg and Berg,<br/>Apostel and some Krenek, and probably not for Webern and hard core<br/>serialism. Does anybody have experiences with this?</p><p>Klaus</p></div>
