I&apos;m using my contour choice ordering algorithm to supply the<br/>directions (ascending, descending) that the intervals are going in,<br/>which in this case will be DAAD (D=descending, A=ascending). During<br/>my experiments with 12 TET interval strings I discovered that most<br/>of the melodies which sounded the best to me had the first interval<br/>descending, so that&apos;s the ordering I prefer, but if you prefer the<br/>first interval to be ascending, use the form ADDA.</p><p>2. Since I&apos;m diagramming these out by hand, I&apos;m limiting myself to 5-<br/>tone tunings for simplicity&apos;s sake in diagramming them. Also, a 5-<br/>tone tuning perfectly fits the 4-place contour choice cycle<br/>DAAD.</p><p>3. I&apos;m only using the smaller forms of each interval class (an<br/>interval class is a pair of intervals which, when combined together,<br/>span an octave). For instance, with the interval class 3/2 and 4/3,<br/>I&apos;m only using the interval 4/3, because it&apos;s the smaller interval<br/>in terms of cents distance spanned. That is because I&apos;m<br/>priveleging/prioritizing melodic &quot;flow&quot; over any overall ranking of<br/>the relative consonance of the intervals.</p><p>Now I&apos;ll get back to responding to Carl&apos;s post.</p><p>Bill Flavell</p></div>
