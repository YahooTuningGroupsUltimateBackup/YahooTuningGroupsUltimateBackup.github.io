This is particularly applicable to some of the 4 note chords<br/>that were raised recently (I can&apos;t remember which post) and it was these<br/>that got me thinking about this question again.  Of course I have always<br/>known that the minor can be expressed this way, but have previously<br/>regarded it as less satisfactory than the major.</p><p>It surprises me that I have thought like that (sounds weird I know)<br/>because in the harmonics theory both situations are equally common.</p><p>It seems that a major chord such as 4:5:6 somehow evokes the note at 1<br/>which is the key two octaves lower, whereas the minor 1/6:1/5:1/4 evokes<br/>the note at 1 which is two octaves above the fifth.  Does anyone else<br/>think of it in this way?</p><p>Over the last few days I have been trying to develop an understanding of<br/>the relationship between two notes as being the sum of all possible<br/>relationships that they have will any and all other notes.  This is a<br/>bit like Feynman diagrams turned into music.  As an example, I had<br/>previously considered the relationship between 1 and 12 as being like<br/>this:<br/>        1--2--4<br/>        |  |  |<br/>        3--6--12</p><p>but also recognising that there are paths from 1 to 12 via all of these<br/>methods 1-12, 1-2-12, 1-3-12, 1-4-12, 1-6-12, 1-2-4-12, 1-2-6-12 and<br/>1-3-6-12.  It is these 8 paths that make the relationship 1 to 12 a very<br/>strong one.  This is the calculation method that I use in the harmonics<br/>theory.</p><p>However two days ago I began to think about the relationship of 2 to 3<br/>and realised that you cannot do it as above and so I started thinking<br/>like 2-6-3, 2-12-3, 2-18-3 and 2-1-3, 2-1/2-3, 2-1/3-3 and so on with<br/>many more steps.  Of course I would have to allow the 1-12 relationship<br/>to also include 1-24-12 and 1-1/2-12 and so on to be fair.</p><p>My hope is that I will find a way that adds up all these possibilities<br/>with due allowance for the length of the path and the size of the<br/>numbers (without getting infinity - which is a definite possibility) to<br/>get an answer that says definitively what the strength of the<br/>relationship is.</p><p>Then in the middle of all this thinking Monzo posts a link to his<br/>translation of Euler&apos;s writing on music at<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a> - POOOWWWEEEEEE!<br/>Here is another man addressing a very similar question and getting a<br/>slightly different answer, but providing great clues.

Of course any Just chord has both a GCD and an LCM, but what we mean<br/>is that for some chords the numbers are a lot smaller when expressed as<br/>divisions of the LCM (LCM=1 instead of GCD=1). These are called utonal<br/>chords, as opposed to otonal. In the utonal form of ratio 1/a:1/b:1/c:1/d<br/>the number 1 represents the so called &quot;guide tone&quot; which is the lowest<br/>harmonic that they all have in common (an actual frequency), while in the<br/>otonal form it represents the virtual fundamental.</p><p>There are also chords in which all the intervals are simple but you don&apos;t<br/>see this in either the otonal or utonal form of expression (and they are<br/>_not_ contradictory). This was first pointed out by Paul Erlich, see<br/>&quot;Anomalous Saturated Suspensions&quot; (ASS) on Graham Breed&apos;s web site or via<br/>Monzo&apos;s dictionary. Here&apos;s the simplest one:</p><p>Minor 7th<br/>C EbG Bb<br/>5:6<br/>  4:5<br/>    5:6<br/>2 : 3<br/>  2 : 3<br/>5  :  9</p><p>otonal form:      10   :12   :15   :18<br/>utonal form:      1/18 :1/15 :1/12 :1/10</p><p>&gt;Of course that means that a minor chord becomes 1/6:1/5:1/4 (a sort of<br/>&gt;inverted major)</p><p>Yes. A shame the word &quot;inverted&quot; already has a quite different meaning in<br/>music. I think I have heard people call it the &quot;dual&quot;. Note that the minor<br/>7th above is its own dual.</p><p>&gt;rather than 10:12:15 and the numbers become much<br/>&gt;smaller. ... Of course I have always<br/>&gt;known that the minor can be expressed this way, but have previously<br/>&gt;regarded it as less satisfactory than the major.</p><p>It _is_ less satisfactory! It&apos;s just not quite as bad as 10:12:15 would<br/>make it seem. The maths may be symmetrical but the psychoacoustics isn&apos;t.<br/>While the minor (or more generally otonal) chords get their consonance from<br/>the consonance of the individual intervals that make them up, the major or<br/>otonal dual, although it contains exactly the same intervals, gets an extra<br/>boost because all intervals have the same relatively high-pitched virtual<br/>fundamental. The virtual fundamental of the minor triad is so low (due to<br/>10:12:15) that the ear-brain says (to some degree) forget that, lets just<br/>go for the 3 separate but relatively high-pitched virtual fundamentals<br/>(from the three separate intervals).</p><p>This is where Sethares theory is limited, it predicts essentially the same<br/>dissonance for a major and a minor (otonal and utonal) having the same mean<br/>frequency. Paul Erlich is still trying to figure out how to extend harmonic<br/>entropy to triads while avoiding this limitation.</p><p>&gt;It seems that a major chord such as 4:5:6 somehow evokes the note at 1<br/>&gt;which is the key two octaves lower, whereas the minor 1/6:1/5:1/4 evokes<br/>&gt;the note at 1 which is two octaves above the fifth.  Does anyone else<br/>&gt;think of it in this way?</p><p>No. I think the minor evokes the virtual fundamental of the 2:3 as the<br/>strongest of the three. Subharmonics are a mathematical construct, not a<br/>psychoacoustic one. Of course the guide tone is actually there and doesn&apos;t<br/>have to be &quot;evoked&quot;, but it&apos;s just a harmonic among others. Its amplitude<br/>may be either increased or reduced depending on relative phases.</p><p>&gt;Over the last few days I have been trying to develop an understanding of<br/>&gt;the relationship between two notes as being the sum of all possible<br/>&gt;relationships that they have will any and all other notes.  This is a<br/>&gt;bit like Feynman diagrams turned into music.  As an example, I had<br/>&gt;previously considered the relationship between 1 and 12 as being like<br/>&gt;this:<br/>&gt;        1--2--4<br/>&gt;        |  |  |<br/>&gt;        3--6--12<br/>...<br/>&gt;My hope is that I will find a way that adds up all these possibilities<br/>&gt;with due allowance for the length of the path and the size of the<br/>&gt;numbers (without getting infinity - which is a definite possibility) to<br/>&gt;get an answer that says definitively what the strength of the<br/>&gt;relationship is.</p><p>Let us know if you get some results. Doesn&apos;t look too promising to me.</p><p>&gt;Recognising the similarity of this method to Feynman diagrams I see that<br/>&gt;it may be a way to link the Harmonics theory to Quantum Physics.  The<br/>&gt;idea dawns that in all the vibrations in the universe the relatedness<br/>&gt;(as measured in some way hinted at above) is the fundamental thing about<br/>&gt;how much they will interact and therefore the resulting physics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dream on ...</p><p>I&apos;m glad you said that last. In music, a fundamental thing is how the<br/>ear-brain has evolved (and been trained) according to whatever could be<br/>most easily cobbled together from whatever went before, in order to give<br/>the greatest reproductive survival to its user, by some incredibly<br/>circuitous causal pathways.</p><p>Of course the physics determines that most sounds of interest will have<br/>partials which are harmonic or nearly so, diminishing in amplitude with<br/>frequency. But all the shortcuts taken by the ear-brain system; what<br/>information it ignores or throws away etc. are highly relevant. If you<br/>ignore that, you&apos;re just doing numerology.</p><p>I love this one that Paul Erlich (who sometimes calls himself Brett Barbaro<br/>on this list) hit me with recently:</p><p>If you listen to a noise signal along with a copy that is delayed by 20ms<br/>you will hear a 50Hz tone, where none exists.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3098 href="#3098">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Mulkers &#x3C;P.Mulkers@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/1999 12:36:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz">rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz</a> (Ray Tomes)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see that I have been guilty of trying to fit everything to the scheme<br/>&gt; where frequencies are in proportion a:b:c:d so that all frequencies are<br/>&gt; DIVISIBLE by a common factor whereas it is just as feasible to have them<br/>&gt; have a common MULTIPLE.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at it in an other way.<br/>(Excuse me while talking in statements and<br/> using other expressions than used in the tuninglist)<br/>Different tones sound well together when wavelengths fit:<br/>A soundwave never comes alone,<br/>it carries always some overtones and some undertones with it.<br/>Different soundwaves fit when they got common overtones or<br/>common undertones relative closely to the chord.<br/>Talking about theoretical overtones and undertones,<br/>we are talking about harmonics and subharmonics.<br/>Every chord has somewhere a smallest common harmonic and<br/>a largest common subharmonic.<br/>The smallest common harmonic is the fundamental of<br/>an other harmonic range made out of all common harmonics.<br/>The distance between the smallest common harmonic and<br/>the largest common subharmonic is something equivalent with<br/>weighting d*n.

One of the ways that I analyse time-series for cycles is<br/>to do a lagged autocorrelation and this shows this type of thing well.<br/>By lagged autocorrelation I mean take a correlation between a series and<br/>itself at lags 1, 2, 3, etc up to n and then plot the result.  This will<br/>show major peaks at lags which are equal to any frequency present plus<br/>multiples thereof.  One reason for doing this is that many series (I am<br/>typical using natural series such as geomagnetic or economic etc) have<br/>strong autocorrelations at the first few multiples but lesser ones at<br/>higher multiples.  I believe that this is true because of modulations by<br/>larger cycles.  The autocorrelation peaks usually die out exponentially<br/>and the rate is a measure of the stability of the frequency.
