No major glitches apart from a cramped chapel and not enough<br/>seating. But chapels are restful places to play. We played a two longish<br/>pieces, one in a slendro tuning and through composed, the other<br/>improvised according to certain rules and using the &quot;Kyai Udan Anim&quot;<br/>pelog described by Lou Harrison.</p><p>And who should be in the audience but the one and only Graham Breed!<br/>Yes, there he was in the back row and he even played one of my zithers<br/>during the short participation session. I was so happy as I&apos;ve never met<br/>anyone from the list before. I was a bit hesitant to spraffle on too<br/>much about the technical side of things in case I got corrected. : - )</p><p>Later Graham had dinner with my family and we had a good conversation<br/>about all things tuning. Graham kindly gave me a CD with some music<br/>samples and pictures of his studio set-up. Look out for some funk soon<br/>from the man.</p><p>It&apos;s great to put faces to names and hopefully I&apos;ll get round to meeting<br/>many more from both sides of the pond. We talked about the UK<br/>enthusiasts getting together somewhere soon to air ideas and look for<br/>common ground.</p><p>And the gigs keep coming in.......</p><p>Best Wishes.</p></div>
