Here&apos;s a link to some new microtonal<br/>&gt;music with tuning interest. As nobody has commented I&apos;m<br/>&gt;assuming indifference. I don&apos;t want you to like it, but<br/>&gt;I think it&apos;s worth listening to. Failing that my next<br/>opus will be a neo-baroque doodle on a cheesy synth (but<br/>&gt;with an interesting tuning) : - )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/slowtones/pages/glass%20page.html">http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/slowtones/pages/glass%20page.html</a></p><p>In any case, I just now found them burried in my inbox.<br/>I won&apos;t have a chance to listen for a few days, but I&apos;ll<br/>get back to you then.</p><p>I was looking up your e-mail address to make sure you saw<br/>this post...</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_55415.html#55415">/tuning/topicId_55415.html#55415</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div>
