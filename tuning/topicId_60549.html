The naming system you suggest<br/>names the sum and the smallest addend, requiring you to subtract to<br/>get the other. For example 5+3=8 out of 11-EDO (5 steps of 1/11, 3<br/>steps of 2/11) would be in the group &quot;tertiary superabundant<br/>octatonic&quot; (in musicians&apos; shorthand, &quot;TertSupeOctÂ™&quot;) requiring an<br/>additional subtraction to realize there are 5 small steps.</p><p>An alternative would be supplying the two addends, which is actually<br/>something I would find more useful when preparing to try and play a<br/>scale. I don&apos;t even care that they add up to eight notes, only that<br/>I&apos;ve got to play five small ones and three big ones in an octave.</p><p>Interesting about this fact is that in the scale tree, I will always<br/>find this scale between x/5 and y/3 sized generators. So I suggest a<br/>nomenclature that implies nearness: &quot;5-near-3&quot;, or &quot;quinparatertiary,&quot;<br/>or something. A nice straddling of the g/p outlook and the L/s<br/>outlook. Because we also have 5 steps next to 3 steps. (Well,<br/>interlaced, but...it allows for shuffled M&apos;sOS too!)</p><p>If we took &quot;near-3&quot; as to mean that the generator is nearer to y/3, we<br/>could conceal (the rather analytical and sidestepping)<br/>superabundance/deficiency in knowing that the 3 steps are bigger<br/>(which they are). This would turn the L+s order backwards, but oh well.</p><p>What this doesn&apos;t work for are the fraction-period scales like 4+2,<br/>which, I confess, I don&apos;t know as well.</p><p>Optional to include are nonoctave &quot;approximations&quot; of uniform and<br/>two-dimensional scales. 6/31-oct. can masquerade quite well as<br/>5-edo...perhaps &quot;parauniform&quot; (though that uses &quot;para&quot; in two<br/>differents situations).

It gives you the whole scale in<br/>one word.</p><p>&gt; If we took &quot;near-3&quot; as to mean that the generator is nearer to y/3,<br/>&gt; we could conceal (the rather analytical and sidestepping)<br/>&gt; superabundance/deficiency in knowing that the 3 steps are bigger<br/>&gt; (which they are).

Because they&apos;re not on the tree?<br/>Bollocks to that!  The terminology doesn&apos;t necessarily HAVE to<br/>reference the tree, if you just take the words to mean s-para-L (or<br/>L-para-s, we&apos;d have to decide that) then it works fine.</p><p>&gt; Optional to include are nonoctave &quot;approximations&quot; of uniform and<br/>&gt; two-dimensional scales. 6/31-oct. can masquerade quite well as<br/>&gt; 5-edo...perhaps &quot;parauniform&quot; (though that uses &quot;para&quot; in two<br/>&gt; differents situations). And so can the MOS 5+1 (6:1). Food for<br/>&gt; thought, anyway.</p><p>Well, the inclusion of these might unforeseeably complicate things.  I<br/>don&apos;t really want to include the L:s ratio in the naming, as that is<br/>precisely what seperates meantone temperaments from superpyth<br/>temperaments (meantones are [almost?] always between 1:1 and 2:1,<br/>while superpyths are [almost?] always greater than 2:1 IN THEIR<br/>HEPTATONIC SCALES), and it is just this type of separation I want to<br/>avoid.  If we wanted to call an MOS of 5+1 (6:1) something similar to<br/>the uniform pentatonic instead of primeparaquinary (or whatever), it<br/>would seem to follow we should call any MOS of n+1 with a ratio of 6:1<br/>something similar to a uniform n-tonic; and conversely, that we should<br/>also do something similar with scales where L and s are in a very<br/>SMALL ratio, close to 1:1.  Thus 32-EDO&apos;s 5+2 of ratio 5:4 would<br/>&quot;deserve&quot; a name close to &quot;uniform heptatonic&quot;.  It is precisely these<br/>complications I wish to avoid, or rather, I do not wish to consider<br/>the ratio of L:s to be a criteria in the naming.</p><p>Of your first example though, the non-octave one, THAT could be<br/>something.  However, as there is such a great infinity of equal<br/>non-octave scales, to try to include them in this terminology may be<br/>unrealistic.  Rather, one could simply call that non-8ve scale of<br/>6-out-of-31&apos;s a uniform pentatonic, and specify that it is compressed<br/>by some amount.  Although calling it a pentatonic does assume an<br/>&quot;equivalence&quot; of compressed octaves, which is not necessarily valid.<br/>So what to call it (or any other non-octave scale) would depend on the<br/>equivalence/period assumed by the composer.  You could have a 5+2<br/>scale of whatever ratio that repeats at the 12:7 or something, but it<br/>would still be a &quot;secondparaquinary&quot;.</p><p>How&apos;s that?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;  In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is the best nomenclature I can come up with.

Names are easy.  You can name them after Snow White and the Seven Dwarves if you like.  Finding things to name is a bit more difficult. The idea behind names based on the scale tree is that some of the relationships between scales are apparent from their names.  Not all, because you have to draw the lines somewhere and not all relationships are in the one dimensional tree anyway.</p><p>&gt; But that&apos;s PRECISELY what I wanted!

I don&apos;t think anybody else does either which is why, like it or not, you&apos;re getting a lot of interest in this topic.  I have names for little bits of the scale tree, that usually relate to linear temperaments or specific melodic patterns.  They tend to be too specific for the simplicity of the shapes you&apos;re looking at.  For example, 3L+4s is mohajira, but only when L+s is a neutral third.  The same shape works with major thirds but then it loses the &quot;mohajira nature&quot;.</p><p>There are also some names that have already been suggested, but you chose not to use.  Most obviously, you aren&apos;t using &quot;EDO&quot; for equal divisions of the octave.  Some other useful names are &quot;augmented&quot; for scales with three periods to the octave and &quot;diminished&quot; for four periods to the octave.  I hope nobody is going to seriously argue that these should refer to temperaments and not shapes.</p><p>Meantone as it happens isn&apos;t relevant, because it would refer to the 7L+5s family, which is beyond your cutoff.  But that still leaves the classic and inverse pentatonics, diatonic and mavila.  It doesn&apos;t matter that this branch of the tree doesn&apos;t have a consistent naming scheme because it&apos;s important enough that you can remember all the inconsistent ones.</p><p>One name I&apos;m using in private is &quot;wonneg&quot; for 4L+1s.  It&apos;s a cross between wonder (1L+4s) and negri (9L+1s).  Probably it should only apply whan L and s are around the same size, but as the word&apos;s never been used in public before there&apos;s no precedent.</p><p>Here are some dwarf names.  Each branch of the scale trees for 1 and 2 periods to the octave is named after a pair of dwarves.  I also used the same names for the near half-octave generators of each tree, because there&apos;s no conflict.</p><p>5L     Snow White pentatonic<br/>1L 4s  Happy pentatonic<br/>2L 3s  Sneezy pentatonic<br/>3L 2s  Sleepy pentatonic<br/>4L 1s  Grumpy pentatonic</p><p>6L     Snow White hexatonic<br/>1L 5s  Happy hexatonic<br/>2L 4s  Sleepy hexatonic<br/>3L 3s  Bashful hexatonic<br/>4L 2s  Dopey hexatonic<br/>5L 1s  Grumpy hexatonic</p><p>7L     Snow White heptatonic<br/>1L 6s  Happy heptatonic<br/>2L 5s  Dopey heptatonic<br/>3L 4s  Doc heptatonic<br/>4L 3s  Sneezy heptatonic<br/>5L 2s  Sleepy heptatonic<br/>6L 1s  Grumpy heptatonic</p><p>8L     Snow White octatonic<br/>1L 7s  Happy octatonic<br/>2L 6s  Sleepy octatonic<br/>3L 5s  Sneezy octatonic<br/>4L 4s  Bashful octatonic<br/>5L 3s  Doc octatonic<br/>6L 2s  Dopey octatonic<br/>7L 1s  Grumpy octatonic</p><p>9L     Snow White nonatonic<br/>1L 8s  Happy nonatonic<br/>2L 7s  Dopey nonatonic<br/>3L 6s  Lufhsab nonatonic<br/>4L 5s  Doc nonatonic<br/>5L 4s  Sneezy nonatonic<br/>6L 3s  Bashful nonatonic<br/>7L 2s  Sleepy nonatonic<br/>8L 1s  Grumpy nonatonic</p><p>10L    Snow White decatonic<br/>1L 9s  Happy decatonic<br/>2L 8s  Ypeels decatonic<br/>3L 7s  Doc decatonic<br/>4L 6s  Dopey decatonic<br/>5L 5s  Bashful decatonic<br/>6L 4s  Sleepy decatonic<br/>7L 3s  Sneezy decatonic<br/>8L 2s  Yepod decatonic<br/>9L 1s  Grumpy decatonic</p><p>                            Graham</p></div><h3><a id=60611 href="#60611">ðŸ”—</a>pgreenhaw@nypl.org</h3><span>9/16/2005 7:31:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yo Beardsley -- let it rest</p><p>(and I did notice the article..... for I pick up the paper copy every<br/>week, and don&apos;t need to rely on a monitor todeliver my village voice)</p><p>___________________________________________<br/>Paul Greenhaw<br/>Music Specialist II<br/>The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts<br/>40 Lincoln Center Plaza<br/>New York, NY 10023<br/>(212) 870-1892<br/>__________________________________________</p><p>David Beardsley &lt;<a href="mailto:db@biink.com">db@biink.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent by: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>09/15/2005 04:34 PM<br/>Please respond to tuning</p><p>        To:     <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>        cc:<br/>        Subject:        Re: [tuning] Re: Scale Families Solution</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure nobody noticed that Kyle Gann wrote an article an<br/>article about<br/>Johnny Reinhart&apos;s latest version of Ive&apos;s Universe in the Village Voice<br/>last week.<br/><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0537,gann,67709,22.html">http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0537,gann,67709,22.html</a><br/>I enjoy Kyle&apos;s writing, so I check in frequently.
