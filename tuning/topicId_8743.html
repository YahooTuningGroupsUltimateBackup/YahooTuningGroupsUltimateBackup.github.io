FWIW, I&apos;m apparently a lot more<br/>sympathetic to this view than you are, and wouldn&apos;t consider it<br/>&quot;hogwash&quot; at all really... but by the same token, and again by way of<br/>analogy, if you want to fly, imitation of nature is probably only<br/>going to amount to bad engineering... &quot;If you want to make something<br/>that flies, flapping your wings is not the way to do it. You bolt a<br/>400-horsepower engine to a barn door, that&apos;s how you fly. You can look<br/>at birds forever and never discover this secret.&quot;</p><p>&gt;No, there&apos;s some weird psychocomplex at work when people can accept a<br/>ravine&apos;s &quot;song&quot; as an acceptable part of their world, but not even a<br/>pianissimo minor second in &apos;Bartok.</p><p>I certainly agree.</p><p>&gt;Well, not !my bell, but hey! we&apos;re talkin&apos; Mother Nature, aren&apos;t we?<br/>Or are we? Just what _are we really talking about?</p><p>Well not that it&apos;s hardly necessary for making great (or good or any)<br/>art, but I&apos;m trying to at least talk about a balanced intonational<br/>view, or at least an attempt to understand the possible benefits of<br/>opposing ones... Awhile back Paul Erlich quoted W. A. Mathieu from<br/>_HARMONIC EXPERIENCE_:</p><p>&quot;Play an equal-tempered chromatic scale again, up and down several<br/>octaves in one hand, not too fast, and let your ear savor its<br/>regularity, its newfangled, manufactured, precisely measured<br/>_sameness_. Don&apos;t be bored, be fascinated, mesmerized. This<br/>sensibility opens the door for the more complex symmetrical forces<br/>hidden inside the Trojan horse of equal temperament.&quot;</p><p>I found this to be a *remarkably* refreshing point of view from<br/>someone who is also known as &quot;Dr. Overtone&quot;! Be fascinated... don&apos;t be<br/>bored... Sounds like a darn good prescription to me!</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>Paul H.

In this case, here&apos;s a perfect example of how music and tuning evolve<br/>together, one influencing the other, and the historico-mathematical accident<br/>that the same 12-equal which allowed the meantone music of one era to move<br/>around to any key ultimately lent itself to symmetrical structures like the<br/>6-tone augmented and whole-tone scales and the 8-tone diminished scales<br/>which led to wonderful musical possibilities (in the hands of<br/>Rimsky-Korsakov, Debussy, Stravinsky, . . .) that may not have been<br/>discovered otherwise.</p></div>
