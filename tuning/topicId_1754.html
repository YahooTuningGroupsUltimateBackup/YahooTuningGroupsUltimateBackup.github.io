I am impressed</p><p>      Ok,  several posts have asked for the tunings I referred to.   This<br/>tuning is by Jim Coleman, and closely follows late 19th century tuning<br/>practises.  It is not equal, but doesn&apos;t seem to create any hinderances in<br/>ensemble playing, and the piano picks up additional resonance it doesn&apos;t have<br/>in ET.  The following numbers are the cents deviation one makes to a 12 ET<br/>tuning.<br/>C   3 Cents<br/>C# 0<br/>D   0<br/>D# 0<br/>E  -3<br/>F   4<br/>F# -2<br/>G   2<br/>G# 0<br/>A -1<br/>A# 2<br/>B -4</p><p>     I hope to have this tuning on the biggest recording sessions I can weasel<br/>it into around here, soon.  The major problem, (aside from vocalists with<br/>limited range needing stuff moved into F# or something), is the bass players.<br/>The inherent stretch in the piano means that the piano is going to be flatter<br/>in the bass and &quot;Bobby Bassman&quot; sits, staring into his Korg, totally lost when<br/>the bottom end is dropped,  (they would have to tune by ear for the key of E,<br/>and they HATE that).<br/>    There are a number of tunings that are presently being employed by tuners<br/>everywhere.  The trick is to get the customer to go for something that isn&apos;t<br/>too radical a change, and then, tuning by tuning, take them back for some Well<br/>Temperament.<br/>    It is just another flank attack on ET,<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=1811 href="#1811">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/1999 9:04:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 16 Mar 1999 <a href="mailto:A440A@aol.com">A440A@aol.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;       Ok,  several posts have asked for the tunings I referred to.
