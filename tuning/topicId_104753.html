But if we<br/>want to play in all keys, 12-ET is very good.</p><p>There is a theory that says we can do better by *shrinking*<br/>the octave, down to 1198 cents.  For music with many<br/>dominant 7th chords (e.g. blues music), the octave would<br/>shrink even more, to about 1196 cents.</p><p>This theory is called &quot;Tenney-weighted optimal tuning&quot;.<br/>It is the tuning which minimizes the weighted error among<br/>of primes we are interested in.  For triads, that is primes<br/>2, 3, and 5.  If we also want dominant 7th chords, it is<br/>primes 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Now, we might also have to acknowledge that 2:1 ratio, outside the octave-span, causes the progressive doubling of the scale differences for 2nds and fifths! Using your words, &quot;in regular musical situations&quot; the pure 2:1 ratio causes a dramatic &quot;divarication&quot; of all intervals deviations, for fifths, 12ths, 17ths, 19ths and so on, and this may explain why, in my view (but not only), 12 root of two was a lame-born unfeasible model. All this... only because we were not able to depart from the idea of one pure interval, nor could we think that the octave single-module needed to be inter-modulated with all the other octaves, into a &quot;whole&quot;.</p><p>Now, perhaps we may agree on this point: focusing onto the scale values (and ratios), nobody could ever manage to &quot;fuse&quot; those &quot;prime&quot; ratios in One single incremental ratio, in other words nobody could obtain a scale ratio able to represent those primes &quot;combined&quot; action.</p><p>In my view, that happened simply because nobody could elaborate on a scale &quot;deviation&quot; ratio, which is merely what Chas model adopts and describes. I hope it is now clear how the Chas &quot;deviation&quot; scale incremental ratio is the result of pure ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1) combined together and &quot;adjusted&quot; by the (s = 1) unity. In fact, in this way both the scale values (the foreground) and the &quot;deviation&quot; values (the background) are most strictly interrelated.</p><p>&gt; In all sincerity, I would like to understand if, in your<br/>&gt; opinion, there was room for improving our current ET model,<br/>&gt; i.e. 12 root of 2.</p><p>You wrote: ...&quot;It depends if we are allowed to use more than 12 notes per octave! With 31 notes we can do very well indeed! If we are restricted to 12 notes, there is not much better than 12-ET.&quot;...</p><p>Well, I respect your outlook but, if it isn&apos;t for now, I hope to be able to better support my theses, that obviously is not the same as yours. In fact, also with Huygens 31-notes model we would suffer from the doubled-deviation effect of 2:1, and that obviously applies also to 24-TET, what now Chas represents with: (3 - delta)^(1/38) = (4 + (s * delta))^(1/48).</p><p>...&quot;For music that only visits a few keys, like Baroque music, meantone and Baroque temperaments can do better. But if we want to play in all keys, 12-ET is very good.&quot;...</p><p>Hmm... Perhaps I can point out that Chas model is not based on 12 notes anymore, in fact it is not limited to a certain number of notes; intervals within the octave are not anymore &quot;copied&quot; outside the octave; what happens is that every single interval has its own meaning and character, in terms of &quot;deviation&quot; from pure ratios. Chas sound &quot;whole&quot; is expandable to infinite, although its period is 19*24 = 456.</p><p>...&quot;There is a theory that says we can do better by *shrinking* the octave, down to 1198 cents. For music with many dominant 7th chords (e.g. blues music), the octave would shrink even more, to about 1196 cents.&quot;...</p><p>Hmm... if that&apos;s a logarithmic scale, we then get narrower fifths and octaves... Numbers and minimized errors may seem to get better, but I still wonder what would happen beyond a single octave, on chromatic fifths, 12ths and so on. This theory seem to move from the same old axiom, namely reduced-deviations, but in my view we needed to &quot;harmonize&quot; deviations. Do you know what I mean?</p><p>...&quot;This theory is called &quot;Tenney-weighted optimal tuning&quot;. It is the tuning which minimizes the weighted error among of primes we are interested in. For triads, that is primes 2, 3, and 5. If we also want dominant 7th chords, it is primes 2, 3, 5, and 7. The &quot;weighted&quot; error allows greater deviation on big primes like 7 than on small ones like 2.

The fundamental axiom then seems to be (again) the equality &quot;pure = consonance = euphony&quot;, fairly in line with the centuries-old approach to the ordering of a scale. And I&apos;m sure we all know about the large amount of solutions (and the wide variety of number of notes per octave) that have been proposed over the centuries, looking at &quot;just&quot; intervals as the main target and trying to manage primes and all commas.</p><p>Perhaps here I ought to expand on some concepts that may enable to focus on some precise points and help to frame Chas theory and model. Also, I would like to distinguish clearly one special (highlighted) case from the Chas general algorithm and infinite other &quot;s&quot; cases.</p><p>Point 1 - Scale and/or step-structure - As mentioned, Chas theory does not limit &quot;per se&quot; the number of steps that (in theory or practice) may be calculated and arbitrarily ordered within an octave, although the highlighted Chas solution (s = 1) calculates indeed one precise incremental ratio. In other words, this approach to the ordering of the scale opens to any scale geometry, which can be drawn either step by step  - or -  by using one single ratio for the whole (log) scale. In this sense, Chas theory conceives any possible (evolutive) step-or-scale variant.</p><p>Point 2 - The highlighted ratio - The highlighted Chas ratio derives from the smallest integers 1, 2, 3 and 4; if used for modeling the whole scale, that k-ratio enumerates (and fits) the actual number (13) of notes-per-octave. We know that having one-pure-ratio scale as the target would give reason to variate indefinitely (arbitrarily) even the amount of steps within an octave; beyond that, the Chas highlighted case, (s = 1), shows a (log) scale that is actually shaped by ratios 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 4:3, when the &quot;s&quot; variable equals the unity. Am I wrong when I say that this was considered impossible?</p><p>Point 3 - Derivation - This is to say that the Chas ET scale derives only from small integers and pure ratios in non-arbitrary terms.</p><p>Point 4 - Variety of scales - Well beyond (and yet together with) infinite varieties of step/scale geometries, the Chas model then demonstrates that one and only one perfectly-coherent non-arbitrary scale exponential geometry exists. In this sense, this unique geometry can well be defined as a &quot;special case&quot;, no more no less than how regular polyhedrons could be said &quot;special&quot; cases, and I really hope we can share this analogy.</p><p>Point 5 - The key - Chas theory considers &quot;deviations&quot; from just (pure) ratios as THE key-phenomenon, namely as the &quot;dynamic&quot; and variable event (here referring to beats) that gives &quot;life&quot; (light/brilliancy/energy) to any interval and to any combination of notes (played simultaneously).</p><p>Point 6 - Proportions - In this sense, &quot;deviations-from-pure&quot; are now regarded as quantities (magnitudes?) that can be &quot;harmonized&quot;; and here &quot;harmony&quot; is also referred to perception, i.e. to a sense (translatable also into numerical evidences) that calls for &quot;proportion&quot;, &quot;symmetry&quot;, &quot;equilibrium&quot; and &quot;invertibility&quot;.</p><p>Point 7 - The phenomenon - By focusing on &quot;deviations&quot;, Chas theory enables to describe &quot;flows of beats&quot; deriving from infinite (chaotic and/or arbitrary) partial combinations.</p><p>The above may explain how the historical fulcrum has been shifted and why I decided to carry on my empirical research having proportional beat-curves as the ultimate target.</p><p>Point 8 - Scale geometry - Having departed from the historical &quot;pure&quot; (debatable) axiom, all the work on actual deviations (i.e. on beats) and their optimal proportions could be carried out directly on intervals, empirically, in the idea that a one-ratio-sensitive (log) scale could only behave as a system of levers, say an interlaced web, whose exponential geometry could not ignore the interdependency of each and every interval, of each relatable (and to-be-related) partial-ratio.</p><p>As we know, 12th root of two favors partial 2, but I could find no logical justification for favoring one single partial and for ordering a (log) scale within such a restricted span. One observation helped to visualize one numerical relation amongst partials: in fact, in our semi-tonal scale, the partial 5&apos;s ordinal position is number 28, and this position shows in fact a sub-module of the octave (7*4), meaning that three contiguous thirds C-E, E-G#, G#-C make an octave. This means that by stretching the octave (as in a system of levers) we will also stretch all thirds, i.e. partial 5.</p><p>So, while I was empirically searching for chromatic proportional beat-curves, the fundamental question (for me) became: Is there a way to gain a &quot;k-constant&quot; (a scale incremental ratio) simply out of combined ratios? Is there an ideal proportional &quot;stretch&quot;, i.e. one precise deviation-degree that can be said to be optimal?</p><p>Point 9 - Representation - Then, the idea of ordering deviations &quot;harmonically&quot; into an optimum &quot;whole&quot; system should have implied/involved two (necessary and sufficient) intervals (two ratios). That is, ruling the &quot;degree of deviation&quot; relative to two intervals, in order to obtain an intrinsic (in this sense &quot;pure&quot;) ratio. I then waited for those two (deviated) intervals to show out, aiming at one ratio that could stand for deviation values as well as scale values, the latter (the foreground) being the direct representation of a bottom order, namely the (log-deviation) order that pure ratios (and the smallest integers) could themselves establish (in the background).</p><p>Of course, the first &quot;equal division&quot; (log) scale based only on partial 2 had its validity and could make sense, if only we set that solution against its historical background; and other more recent ET solutions (7th root of 3/2 and 19 root of two) indeed represent other &quot;possible&quot; (log) scales; and I am aware of the fact that Chas, on the one hand, is highlighting one &quot;special&quot; case that is one of many (admissible) variants. And we know that - not last - Guerino Mazzola too has produced a generic formula that includes all possible functions.</p><p>Point 10 - The Chas ET scale constant - On the other hand though, beyond any general representation (including Chas algorithm), I do not think I would have been able to extract (isolate/attain?) the Chas ET scale ratio (1.0594865443501) and that precise delta value (0.0021253899646...) had I not gone through the conceptual route I&apos;ve partially described above.</p><p>Point 11 - The span - It should be clear that the theoretical tempering of 12 semitones is not enough for achieving a coherent &quot;whole&quot;, in fact both partial 3 and 5 are positioned outside the octave compass (ordinal 19 and 28) and this, in general, might have suggested to &quot;rule&quot; a wider span. On top of that, as mentioned, the 2:1 octave produces an inconvenient effect onto the scale, in that all narrow interval deviations end up doubling their values every other octave. The Chas highlighted case is not based on one interval, no single ratio is favored, so the tempered span (now) is not limited. All partials are actually tempered across the entire scale.</p><p>Carl, you wrote &quot;...there is not much better than 12-ET&quot;... I think I would be able to understand your preference for 12 root of two, if you could kindly explain your reasons. In any case, seeing how familiar you are with maths representations, I am sure you understand both the Chas algorithm elementary structure and the one highlighted case, and I would be very grateful if you could help me represent this geometry with your favorite mathematical tool. And of course, in case you knew about someone that could already get numerically &quot;there&quot;, I&apos;d be very pleased to be informed.</p><p>Last, about cents, I do not use them mainly because they add approximations.</p><p>Hi Bogdan,</p><p>As you already know, the algorithm&apos;s basic structure is: two partial values, two scale ordinal position, two delta-wedges and one (s) variable.</p><p>The &quot;special&quot; highlighted case is: (3 - delta)^(1/19) = (4 + (s * delta))^(1/24) s = 1</p><p>The 4th is the first interval that, with its small circle (before the fifth&apos;s circle), enables to obtain all the other notes, before getting again to the generator. We also know that 4:3 is not really a partial sound, but the results of 2*2:3 and it is a fact that 2/3 = 0.666... At the numerator, all powers of two (and all integer numbers which are not power of 3) will produce a quotient (:3) with a periodic decimal value, either .333 or .666.</p><p>So, it is only by convention that 3/2 * 4/3 equals 2, and beyond convention the periodicity of 1/3, 2/3, 4/3 etc. can be managed and exploited. In fact 2/3 and 4/3 are the first n/n+1 and n/n-1 that produce an endless decimal value. For this reason, in my view, 2 and 3 together well represent the determining period-factor.</p><p>In general, not considering the &quot;s&quot; variable, delta values respond also to primes quotients; in particular, partial 4 squares partial 2 (the octave) so enabling to inter-modulate all octaves.</p><p>As mentioned, we could gain the Chas highlighted ratio (1.0594865443501...) also dealing with this whole issue in dynamic terms, i.e. calculating other delta values by using other partials and other &quot;s&quot; values; but the above &quot;special&quot; representation should (shall?) enable to show and help to acknowledge how this scale k-factor originates simply and precisely from those roots, so qualifying the Chas geometry as the correct (non-arbitrary) ET reference.</p><p>In conclusion, Chas ET (s = 1) 12ths and 15ths, beat-wise, are the two flow-factors that share the same delta-deviation value (degree). These two intervals shape this exponential &quot;whole&quot; form, meaning that they drive the linear continuous growth of the whole. Fourths, fifths and octaves, with their beat-curves, also affect the form and its torsion. Thus all intervals (all partials) have their precise role in determining this sound whole, and in this sense I would use the word &quot;harmonic&quot;. In fact, Chas theory describes &quot;s&quot; as a dynamic and evolutive variable. In this precise (yet contradictory) sense, the highlighted s = 1 case is only meant to represent the direct product of the original primes.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Alfredo</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Alfredo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would then ask: is there a point in trying to calculate the<br/>&gt; &gt; interval R by ignoring one of the primes (2, 3 and 5) that<br/>&gt; &gt; stand for octaves, fifths and thirds?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can pick any primes you like.  Your choice should reflect<br/>&gt; the music you want to play.  If you are playing triads, you<br/>&gt; should choose three primes: 2, 3, 5.  Some 20th century music<br/>&gt; (e.g. Russian piano school) may prefer only primes 2 and 3,<br/>&gt; whereas American blues music would prefer 2, 3, 5, 7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We all know about the &quot;compromise&quot; achieved with 12 root<br/>&gt; &gt; of two: the &quot;pure&quot; octave is the one postulate at the base<br/>&gt; &gt; of that model,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is true that the idea of tempering the octave was not<br/>&gt; seriously considered until recent decades.  But 12-ET is<br/>&gt; close to optimal anyway for primes, 2, 3 and 5, and as you<br/>&gt; discovered, even closer for primes 2 and 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ...&quot;There is a theory that says we can do better by *shrinking*<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the octave, down to 1198 cents. For music with many dominant 7th<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; chords (e.g. blues music), the octave would shrink even more, to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; about 1196 cents.&quot;...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmm... if that&apos;s a logarithmic scale,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Around here we would say, it is an &quot;equal division&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;rank 1 temperament&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; we then get narrower fifths and octaves... Numbers and minimized<br/>&gt; &gt; errors may seem to get better, but I still wonder what would<br/>&gt; &gt; happen beyond a single octave,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ratios of 5 continue to improve, e.g. 5/2 is better than 5/4<br/>&gt; and 10/3 better than 5/3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Chas model, in its basic form (s = 1), does not consider any<br/>&gt; &gt; individual interest. Actually, I would appreciate if you could<br/>&gt; &gt; tell me about one arbitrary element in Chas basic algorithm:<br/>&gt; &gt; (3 - delta)^(1/19) = (4 + delta)^(1/24).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is a special case of the algorithm I described, with no<br/>&gt; weighting for the primes, and considering only &apos;primes&apos;<br/>&gt; 3 &amp; 4.  To include weighting, we would get<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ((3 - (delta/log 3))^(1/19) = (4 + (delta/log 4))^(1/24)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is also equivalent to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ((3 - (delta/log 3))^(1/19) = (2 + (delta/log 2))^(1/12)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To add prime 5, we can no longer use a single error term<br/>&gt; &quot;delta&quot;.  Rather, we minimize the total squared error of<br/>&gt; three terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you already know, to evaluate systems other than 12/oct,<br/>&gt; we change the exponents.  To evaluate 31/oct, we need<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ((3 - (delta/log 3))^(1/49) = (2 + (delta/log 2))^(1/31)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, perhaps it all depends on what we consider to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;optimal&quot;. For me optimal, referred to theory and modeling,<br/>&gt; &gt; means:<br/>&gt; &gt; 0 - a theory that is not based on arbitrary premises;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 - a model that can &quot;manage&quot; all arbitrary deviations,<br/>&gt; &gt; starting from a Non-Arbitrary form;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2 - that is able to strictly relate (proportionally) scale<br/>&gt; &gt; values, all intervals and deviations;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3 - that is able to combine, shrink and/or stretch all<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios, no matter individual preferences;<br/>&gt; &gt; 4 - that is actually feasible in practice;<br/>&gt; &gt; 5 - that is able to represent our reality in dynamic terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you would like the theory I&apos;m referring to.<br/>&gt; Here is more information:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tenney-Euclidean+Tuning">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Tenney-Euclidean+Tuning</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=104859 href="#104859">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2012 2:18:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Alfredo,</p><p>&gt; In my view, the fulcrum of those works is (again) &quot;avoidable<br/>&gt; errors&quot; and &quot;reduced deviations&quot;, in the sense that &quot;optimal&quot;<br/>&gt; seems to be referred to &quot;just&quot; intervals and to those (numerical)<br/>&gt; solutions that may reduce deviations from pure ratios.<br/>&gt; The fundamental axiom then seems to be (again) the equality<br/>&gt; &quot;pure = consonance = euphony&quot;, fairly in line with the<br/>&gt; centuries-old approach</p><p>Yes, correct.

But so is Chas, where the intervals of<br/>interest can be factored with primes 2 and 3.<br/>The only other difference is that Chas considers constant<br/>frequency deviations to give constant discord, whereas most<br/>work in the field assumes constant log-frequency deviations<br/>to do this.</p><p>&gt; Point 4 - Variety of scales - Well beyond (and yet together<br/>&gt; with) infinite varieties of step/scale geometries, the Chas<br/>&gt; model then demonstrates that one and only one perfectly-coherent<br/>&gt; non-arbitrary scale exponential geometry exists.</p><p>No, I don&apos;t agree this is demonstrated, and don&apos;t understand<br/>such a grandiose claim.</p><p>&gt; Point 5 - The key - Chas theory considers &quot;deviations&quot; from<br/>&gt; just (pure) ratios as THE key-phenomenon, namely as the<br/>&gt; &quot;dynamic&quot; and variable event (here referring to beats) that<br/>&gt; gives &quot;life&quot; (light/brilliancy/energy) to any interval and to<br/>&gt; any combination of notes (played simultaneously).</p><p>The rate of beating is given by the frequency offset, but<br/>in my experience, the rate matters less than the intensity<br/>of the beating.</p><p>&gt; Point 6 - Proportions - In this sense, &quot;deviations-from-pure&quot;<br/>&gt; are now regarded as quantities (magnitudes?) that can be<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonized&quot;;</p><p>I don&apos;t agree that aligning or otherwise &quot;harmonizing&quot;<br/>beat rates makes a noticeable improvement in concordance.<br/>In fact, it may be detrimental, since aligning beat rates<br/>increases the maximum intensity of the beating pattern.</p><p>&gt; As we know, 12th root of two favors partial 2,</p><p>Again, the 12th root of two does not particularly favor<br/>partial 2, but is an exceptional low-error tuning when a<br/>broad range of targets (such as 2 3 and 5, or 2 3 5 and 7)<br/>are considered.</p><p>&gt; Carl, you wrote &quot;...there is not much better than 12-ET&quot;...<br/>&gt; I think I would be able to understand your preference for<br/>&gt; 12 root of two, if you could kindly explain your reasons.<br/>&gt; In any case, seeing how familiar you are with maths<br/>&gt; representations, I am sure you understand both the Chas<br/>&gt; algorithm elementary structure and the one highlighted case,<br/>&gt; and I would be very grateful if you could help me represent<br/>&gt; this geometry with your favorite mathematical tool. And of<br/>&gt; course, in case you knew about someone that could already get<br/>&gt; numerically &quot;there&quot;, I&apos;d be very pleased to be informed.</p><p>Here is one way to look at it</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/TOPDamageOfETs.txt">http://lumma.org/music/theory/TOPDamageOfETs.txt</a></p><p>The table shows TOP damage (which is the Tenney-weighted<br/>error I explained last time) for different ETs at different<br/>&quot;prime limits&quot;.  A prime limit, for example the 11-limit,<br/>is the set of all rational numbers that can be factored with<br/>primes no greater than 11.<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_limit">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_limit</a></p><p>The ETs listed in my table are only those that improve upon<br/>the 17-limit TOP damage of all smaller ETs.  You can see that<br/>12 is listed, because its 17-limit damage is lower than all<br/>smaller ETs.  But also, we can see something of how well 12<br/>performs at other limits.  For primes 2 and 3 only, we must<br/>go to 29/octave.  For the other prime limits, we really do not<br/>get much better until 19/octave.  So 12 is an outstanding<br/>system no matter which chords we want to use.  One must nearly<br/>double the number of notes/octave to improve matters<br/>significantly.  And we assume musicians would like, all else<br/>being equal, fewer tones rather than more.</p><p>You might object that all these systems favor the octave.<br/>But in fact, when the tuning of the octave is allowed to<br/>vary to minimized the total weighted error, most of the time<br/>the results are fairly close to the exact division of the<br/>octave.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=104870 href="#104870">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/18/2012 10:12:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Alfredo,</p><p>What I think is missing is</p><p>1.

I thought that a &quot;pure&quot; (meaning non-arbitrary and self-contained) tuning-form could exist, and it should have been the result of partials-And-(proportional)-deviations. Then empirically, I considered chromatic intervals and looked for proportional beat-rate progressions, trying to identify/visualize the beat-curves relative to every interval.</p><p>So the focus was/is not on one or some chords, but on a &quot;whole&quot;, say a multi-plane/level geometry that appears to be still (and unique), but can (should) also be seen as &quot;elastic&quot;, like a 4D spiderweb. The accent is not anymore on &quot;discord&quot; that might be avoided, but on discord as the proportional &quot;agent&quot;, discord as the multi-partial (s-variable) factor that actually keeps this entity together.
