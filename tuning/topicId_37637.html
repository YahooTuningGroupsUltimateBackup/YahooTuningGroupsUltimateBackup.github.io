So<br/>&gt; &gt;that&apos;s very different to &quot;within a cent or two&quot;.  And you only need 10<br/>&gt; &gt;notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Graham.  And I&apos;ll note that the only instruments that I know of<br/>&gt; that you can even tune with that degree of precision are electronic, or<br/>&gt; very expensive pianos.  So anyone claiming they can hear the difference<br/>&gt; should say what they were doing when they heard a difference.  Then I&apos;d<br/>&gt; be genuinely interested, as I was when Graham said he&apos;d tuned<br/>&gt; electronically-generated sawtooths to within 0.1 cents of a 3:2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth (probably very little on past form) I tune strings and steel tubes to 0.1 cent<br/>accuracy, according to my Peterson strobe that is. And that&apos;s about 20 minutes testing and fine<br/>tuning on each string  at room temperature. The tubes, every time I check, are accurate, no<br/>problem with the fundamental, as I have eliminated partial interference using filters. Maybe you<br/>could add these to your list or, if my tuner&apos;s wrong, I could sue Peterson under the UK Trades<br/>Description Act.</p><p>Regards</p></div>
