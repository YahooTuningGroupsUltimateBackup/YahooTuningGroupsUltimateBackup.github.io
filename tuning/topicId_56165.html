It was made with Csound, and is based on a &quot;combination tone chord organ&quot; instrument design that was inspired by a couple of figures in Doty&apos;s &quot;Just Intonation Primer&quot;.  It&apos;s slow and drone-y, definitely headphone music.  More details (probably too many) on the site.

It&apos;s just a Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop running (blecch) Windows XP.  In this case, &quot;64-bit&quot; refers to the fact that this build of Csound is compiled for higher-precision floating point operations.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>&gt;Wonderful piece, Dave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Say, what 64-bit platform were you using?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Carl<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p></div>
