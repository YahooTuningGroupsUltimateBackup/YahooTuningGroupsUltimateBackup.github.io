But if you re-tune some of the strings, you could get quarter tones or sixth-tones (Busoni was interested in that).<br/>It hasn&apos;t been mentioned here that I recall, but if you look in Harry Partch&apos;s &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot;, there are references to and pictures of &quot;adapted guitars&quot; for use with his 43-tone to the 2/1 (octave) scale.<br/>I wouldn&apos;t recommend that you rip out your frets with the idea of moving them around unless you first look into quite a bit of scale theory.  On the other hand, you might prefer to fool around and see what you can come up with.  You can&apos;t be sure in advance what you will really like, either musically or in terms of ease or difficulty of playing.  You may have to do your own composing, as well.<br/>If your guitar is a good one, you might see if you can find an unfinished kit guitar and work with that instead.<br/>On several instruments Harry Partch used moveable rods which could give gliding tones, not unlike a Hawaiian guitar effect.  If you had a guitar with no frets, steel rods about 1/16&quot; in diameter could be used between a flat fingerboard and the strings.  Bear in mind that with any untempered tuning, any final arrangement of frets is likely to have them segmented rather than straight across, or at least at an angle or even curved.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:sunnee@mindspring.com">sunnee@mindspring.com</a> 04/23/01 09:23AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Hi all,</p><p>Being an intermediate guitar player, and tired of playing in Cmaj, I<br/>started playing with the tuning pegs.
