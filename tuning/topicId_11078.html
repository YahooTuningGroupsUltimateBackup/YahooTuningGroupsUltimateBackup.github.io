This quartet was written in commission of the<br/>&gt; Huygens-Fokker foundation.</p><p>Thanks, Manuel for this post, which I enjoyed.  The string quartet<br/>seemed very strong, but it really didn&apos;t seem all that &quot;xenharmonic&quot; to<br/>me, although I understand it is supposed to be in just intonation...<br/>Don&apos;t string players play a bit like that anyway??</p><p>Certainly it wasn&apos;t at all as striking in a xenharmonic direction as the<br/>string quartet movement that Daniel Wolf posted up here not too long<br/>ago...</p><p>My guess is that it might also be a little on the &quot;traditional&quot; side for<br/>the Kronos... but I could be wrong.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>_____________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
