Perhaps the fact that the period itself is so</p><p>dissonant has something to do with it as well.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; That, however, I do actually doubt a bit.&nbsp; In fact I purposefully round the period to 1.625 or 13/8...because it is the only fraction on the harmonic series I found that beats with octave-like smooth-ness against 1/1 and yet maintains virtually the same sense of tonal color as 1.618 (unlike 8/5 AKA 1.6, for example).&nbsp; So basically 1.625 &quot;sounds like PHI minus the excessive beating&quot;, at least to my ears.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I do suspect very strongly...that the PHI scale has a weird property of not increasing dissonance notice-ably as more notes are played within the PHI-tave.&nbsp; Meaning where-as<br/>A) Playing any one interval in 12TET will likely sound cleaner than in my PHI scale<br/>B) Playing any two in 12TET will sound a tad cleaner</p><p>C) Playing three will sound more or less the same<br/>D) Playing four will actually begin to sound more natural in my PHI scale<br/>etc.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put, the PHI scale seems to lean itself more toward a sense of relaxation and resolve with large chords and not small ones.&nbsp; It indeed has a somewhat opposite effect on perceived consonance when adding extra notes to a chord...and the &quot;consonance penalty&quot; for adding notes seems much lower than with JI, at least to my ears.</p><p>&nbsp; So, if you&apos;re not over-glorifying it, it means that my PHI scale is achieving the exact goal I designed it for: to make it possible to make huge chords with huge degrees of tonal color within a small interval space sound fairly relaxed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The final challenge, of course, is do you think my scale sounds better than the x/8 harmonic series when all tones of both my scale and the series are played at once (and, if not, what makes the harmonic series better that I can research more into and improve)?</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=83468 href="#83468">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2009 8:05:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;   But, yes, I am using PHI as the period in place of the 2/1 octave.

Whereas most scales I hear become less<br/>&gt; natural when more than a certain # of notes are played closely<br/>&gt; together...doing that seems to have an opposite effect in these PHI<br/>&gt; scales...an effect of making the structure (of the chord formed by all the<br/>&gt; notes) feel more aligned and relaxed.</p><p>Something to think about... If you play in a C major scale CDEGAB,<br/>that still sounds pretty &quot;aligned&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot; and &quot;resonant&quot; to me<br/>(especially if you tune the A to 27/16). If you throw the F in there,<br/>CDEFGAB, the whole thing sounds much less relaxed, no matter whether<br/>you put the A in there or leave it out. I doubt if it has anything to<br/>do with beating. Some food for thought.</p><p>&gt;    One thing I have noticed, is that having music with low consonance that<br/>&gt; seems steady in its level of consonance actually often sounds much more<br/>&gt; resolved than very consonant and structured music with sudden dips in<br/>&gt; consonance.  The whole feeling of a composition&apos;s having a steady goal so<br/>&gt; far as introducing consonance/dissonance in a way that feels guided seems<br/>&gt; crucial to me.</p><p>Do you have any examples of this?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=83485 href="#83485">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2009 12:56:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike B&gt;&quot;The phi interval is the noble mediant between 1/1 and 2/1. &quot;</p><p>&nbsp; I&apos;ll come back to this....<br/>&nbsp; Now I realize the paper was indeed using a similar way to split between tones to make a scale.&nbsp; What threw me off was the fact it was taking the noble mediant between pre-existing diatonic scale fractions rather than between 1/1 and 2/1 and then between the noble mediant of the result and 1 and so forth (as I do in my scale).&nbsp; So the result is completely different in their case (and I still don&apos;t see the usefulness of the paper beyond saying &quot;noble mediant&quot; is another term to describe PHI by)...but at least now I know that term.</p><p>Mike B&gt;&quot;What is likely is that the scale structure repeating at phi is an easily</p><p>recognizable pattern that leads to some perceptual nature of</p><p>&quot;equivalence, &quot; although it&apos;s not the same type of equivalence as 2/1</p><p>chroma equivalence.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly, and the perceptual equivalence, so far as the equivalence of periodic buzz, is what I call &quot;proportionate beating&quot; or &quot;symmetrical beating&quot;.<br/>&nbsp; It&apos;s hard to explain why in pure and simple mathematics, but it does seem like the mind is good at aligning PHI based ratios (the obvious one being 1.618034) to mesh with harmonic-series ratios like 1.625 when needed.&nbsp; This is one phenomena I am having a heck of a time explaining with math...just like Plompt and Llevelt&apos;s theory of dissonance curves (which were derived by hearing tests rather than mathematical equations)...you really just have to listen to get a sense for what the continuum of beating-proportionality is like.</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=83493 href="#83493">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/2009 7:29:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   But, yes, I am using PHI as the period in place of the 2/1 octave.

Also that calling the generating interval of PHI an &quot;equivalence&quot; like the 8ve will lead to all notes having the same name. eg 1: in 36TET, all 35 notes can be generated from PHI 25 or its inverse 11, eg 2: for pure PHI&apos;s, these will spiral off to infinity and beyond?? So I&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re saying here.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt; That&apos;s interesting. What&apos;s the reason for this approach?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, what about the fact that the fact that the bandwidth of each<br/>&gt; cochlear auditory filter is going to change per register? What might<br/>&gt; beat in a low register might not beat up at 8K.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Could well be true.  I noticed my scale has quite a few (around 60-70%) of<br/>&gt; &gt; the notes fairly near to in common with the x/8 harmonic series (8/8 9/8<br/>&gt; &gt; 10/8 etc.)...yet, at least to my ears, the beating sounds much more relaxed<br/>&gt; &gt; in the PHI scale than with the harmonic series (a bit like the sound of a<br/>&gt; &gt; string section vs. an organ).  That became obvious when I made my last sound<br/>&gt; &gt; example using that harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is something pleasant about the beating pattern you have... I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know if it really sounds &quot;better&quot; than the harmonic series or if<br/>&gt; the harmonic series is just different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    I will admit, I have not heard the term chroma...what does it mean?<br/>&gt; &gt;    Though I will admit a huge reason I was attracted to working with PHI is<br/>&gt; &gt; the mystery &quot;why does an interval so statistically far from 12TET somehow<br/>&gt; &gt; sound so natural to me&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tone chroma is also referred to as &quot;pitch color&quot; and refers to a<br/>&gt; perceptual quality that a note will have; this quality is usually<br/>&gt; shared by all notes of a certain pitch class regardless of what octave<br/>&gt; they are in. For example, a C has a certain chroma, D has a different<br/>&gt; chroma, etc. Supposedly anyone can become aware of these subtle<br/>&gt; characteristics of different notes, although people with absolute<br/>&gt; pitch have greater ease at assigning them labels and recognizing them<br/>&gt; later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is your justification for using PHI in this case though? The PHI<br/>&gt; interval is a pretty cool sound, although what I like about it is that<br/>&gt; it is almost maximally atonal from an HE standpoint - that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem like the reason you&apos;re using it though. Then again, sometimes<br/>&gt; 13/8 itself sounds pretty out there to my ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    The final challenge, of course, is do you think my scale sounds better<br/>&gt; &gt; than the x/8 harmonic series when all tones of both my scale and the series<br/>&gt; &gt; are played at once (and, if not, what makes the harmonic series better that<br/>&gt; &gt; I can research more into and improve)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can&apos;t hope to quantify something like that. You might think some<br/>&gt; kind of organizational pattern like 5-limit JI sounds better than<br/>&gt; random notes being played, but atonal music sounds great as well. They<br/>&gt; are simply different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div>
