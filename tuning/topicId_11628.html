But I still have much more<br/>&gt; research to do before being able to present a good case for this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is absolute proof that they knew how to arrive at<br/>&gt; arbitrarily close approximations of the square-root of 2<br/>&gt; (tablet YBC 7289), which could have been of use in calculating<br/>&gt; 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And there is also proof that they limited their cycle of<br/>&gt; modes to 12.  This may be a clue that the scale was tempered,<br/>&gt; because assuming Pythagorean tuning, the 12th raising or lowering<br/>&gt; of the tritone would give a scale identical to the starting one,<br/>&gt; except that it would be a semitone higher or lower (respectively)<br/>&gt; than the original.  Tempering the scale would remove that<br/>&gt; problem.  The CBS 10996 tablet also seems to give a tuning<br/>&gt; procedure which provides a way of checking intervals in more<br/>&gt; than one way, perhaps to assist in tempering by ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ernest McClain (first in _The Myth of Invariance_, and in more<br/>&gt; depth in _The Pythagorean Plato_) makes a case for the Greeks<br/>&gt; having calculated 12-tET, and of course I think it can be shown<br/>&gt; that, just as the Babylonians took over the Sumerian culture<br/>&gt; as their own, much of the Greek music-theory, science, math,<br/>&gt; mythology, etc., was taken from the Babylonians and thus goes<br/>&gt; back to Sumerian roots.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been doing a lot of research into the Bible too, and can<br/>&gt; see that a lot of ancient Hebrew writings are also based on<br/>&gt; Sumerian originals.  I have a *lot* more to say about this,<br/>&gt; but it&apos;s off-topic...  But anyway, Dr. Ewald Metzler, who<br/>&gt; purports to have reconstructed the original tablets of the<br/>&gt; 10 Commandments, also sees evidence of ancient Hebrew music-<br/>&gt; theory in its dimensions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/7353/dr_ed09e.htm">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/7353/dr_ed09e.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And see the footnote to this message I posted here, concerning<br/>&gt; the possibility of Sumerian 12-tET:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11107">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11107</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for this Hurrian hymn being the oldest existing musical score,<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think it is.  The CBS 10996 tablet is older, and I believe<br/>&gt; that *it* is the oldest score.  More on that below...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I need some help from someone out there to finish this project:<br/>&gt; is there any way to transform a Finale .MUS file into a regular<br/>&gt; graphic (.gif, .jpg, etc.)?  If not, since I don&apos;t have a scanner,<br/>&gt; could someone who has Finale and a scanner print out my .MUS files<br/>&gt; and create graphics from the hard-copy and send them to me?  Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will have *much*, much more to come on this during the rest of<br/>&gt; this year.  The post on which I was working follows below:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------- post drafted a month ago, never submitted: ------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey folks, big news (to me, at least):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my quest to unravel the history of tuning and music-theory,<br/>&gt; I&apos;m convinced that I&apos;ve correctly deciphered the fundamental<br/>&gt; basics of Sumerian music-theory, and thus have traced my<br/>&gt; history back to its ultimate beginning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because the Sumerians were the first culture to invent<br/>&gt; writing itself (c. 3200 BC), we will not find a written</p><p>I do not mean to be hostile or sarcastic.  I just have this joke in my mind and I want to tell<br/>you folks cause it sounds funny to me.  So here it goes:</p><p>Researchers have discovered that the planets are also arranged diatonically and suggests that<br/>the universe discovered diatonic harmony billions of years before Pythagorus and the<br/>Sumerians.  Furthermore, in the synergetic geometry of Buckminster Fuller, it is shown that<br/>even quantum wave and therfore also mental processes are arranged according to Bode&apos;s Law of<br/>musical intervals.  It might be the case that the first thing that The Uncreated Perfect One<br/>does to create a universe is to play a guitar or piano or some sort of diatonic instrument.<br/>The rest of creation is just peals of bells.</p><p>I do not mean to offend your very serious research.  The joke just sounds really funny to me.<br/>I myself am doing research to reconstruct the lost &quot;wing&quot; of Chinese classics, The Book of<br/>Music.  If you are interested in taking your scholarship beyond Sumeria, the I Ching is much<br/>older than Phoenician letters and the system suggests Bode&apos;s Law of diatonic structure.  Bode&apos;s<br/>Law is a constant of physics and reappears at every level of their mathematical abstractions.<br/>I have discovered a holographic function to the I Ching that I can e-mail you if you want to go<br/>that far back into history.  The I Ching suggests a 16 tone scale.  16 tones are very<br/>convenient because of their easy divisibility.  Except they sound horrible, so the holographic<br/>I Ching gave way to the more diatonic binary I Ching (today&apos;s standard book of changes).<br/>      It&apos;s much too much work for me.  If you are interested I can hand over the material to<br/>you and see what you can do with it.  Or you can wait for my book which will reproduce all the<br/>material I am hinting at.  Schoenberg&apos;s tone row theory is going to be the key to<br/>reconstructing the lost book of music of the chinese classics.</p><p>My head is going to explode.  I&apos;m just a jazz-rock guitar player into numerology (tone rows).<br/>This stuff hurts my head.</p><p>  <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor">http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor</a></p></div><h3><a id=11631 href="#11631">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2000 2:18:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Troubledoor wrote:</p><p>&gt;   <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor">http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor</a></p><p>Your web link is screwy - is it supposed to be like that?</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=11672 href="#11672">ðŸ”—</a>John F.

Goscelyn Godwin&apos;s &quot;Cosmic Music&quot; talks with great simplicity at how tidy everything from physics to music to religion gets organized if one were to use Bode&apos;s Law as the main analytical tool.  This was the spirit of Schopenhauer&apos;s World Will as Music philosophy and is the basis of Theosophy, Judaism, Hinduism,etc.etc.  Mental objects also obey Bode&apos;s Law.  One&apos;s personal thoughts are always heard as a little whispering voice and these can also get quite loud.  But they are subtle waves and are subject to quantum wave mechanics so we can&apos;t detect them yet with our particle nature<br/>tools...computers are going to get to the quantum wave level of small transistors in the next few years so maybe we&apos;ll get to detect quantum wave thoughts.  I&apos;m pretty sure that they are going to find little Bode&apos;s Laws all over the thought space.  This actually already happened with natural philosophy or alchemy, but their proofs are very well hidden due to the Spanish Inquistion tending to kill them for exposing the musical superstructure of creation.  This is the sense of The Holy Bible&apos;s 7 diatonic days of creation.  Today&apos;s Spanish Inquistion is the need to make textbooks to try to analyze everything into Bode&apos;s Law.  It would take thousands of pages to prove that it&apos;s real and a lot of people would get mad at them.<br/>It&apos;s a very touchy subject to accuse God of playing music while we were being created.<br/>Worse still, it causes great pains to the body to hear in thought form what the soul can express by mere listening to the standard Bach and Mozart pieces.  Arvo Part&apos;s &quot;Miserere&quot; is a better new representative of this cosmic vision  of world order as music.<br/>The books I get most of my Bode&apos;s Law stuff is &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; by Guy Murchie and &quot;A Fuller Explanation&quot; by Amy C.

In geometrical form, all the numbers of any scale or magnitude of size always get reduced to the musical intervals.  That was the essence of Einstein&apos;s Relativity Theory.
