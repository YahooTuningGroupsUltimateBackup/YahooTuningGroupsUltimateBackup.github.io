One option, which in fact I do, is to seek out such<br/>&gt;&gt;overlaps, evaluate them for duration, and essentially throw away the<br/>&gt;&gt;very brief complex chords formed when they don&apos;t last longer than some<br/>&gt;&gt;preset time, which I typically set to 64 msec.</p><p>[Carl Lumma, TD 498.4:]<br/>&gt;My procedure only tunes the five loudest notes at a given time; less if<br/>&gt;there are less than five unique (after octave equivalence) pitches<br/>&gt;sounding.</p><p>Mmmm.  My experience has been that, if you don&apos;t explicitly go after<br/>and neutralize those small overlap points, you end up with tuning you<br/>don&apos;t want when the dying notes die.  Real-time schemes don&apos;t, of<br/>course, &quot;know&quot;, when a new chord starts, whether the old one is about to<br/>die or not, which is one of the really tough challenges of real-time<br/>adaptive JI, as opposed to what I call leisure retuning.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Do you plan to have any chords actually tuned to 12-tET?</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Nope.</p><p>So... if the first chord is an augmented triad, or full diminished<br/>chord, how will it be tuned?  Symmetry in, asymmetry out: a tough<br/>proposition.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;How will you handle drift?  The ol&apos; comma pump, repeated many times?</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Ignores drift entirely.  Repeated pump makes the music go flat.</p><p>It&apos;s hard for me to believe you&apos;ll be satisfied with that!  Drift<br/>control is challenging, but, IMHO, all but essential.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;If there are three successive chords, and only the outer two have a C,<br/>&gt;&gt;say, will the two C&apos;s consider their relative tuning?</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Nope.  In a way, I&apos;m actually after &quot;strict&quot; JI here.  I call it<br/>&gt;adaptive because it&apos;s getting at JI with only 12-pitches, moving the<br/>&gt;tonic is all over the place.  But I&apos;m trying more to access high-limit<br/>&gt;pitch sets than I am trying to get JI to conform to meantone logic.</p><p>Hmmm, I don&apos;t quite follow the whole paragraph.  But listeners like Paul<br/>E are likely to find mismatches if your method doesn&apos;t, I fear.  Of<br/>course, you may or may not want to get excited about that...</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;When you refer to &quot;ticks&quot; in a MIDI file, what does this mean?  I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt;aware of the MIDI time scheme, but if nothing is changing, there&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;nothing to focus on, yes?</p><p>[Carl:]<br/>&gt;Just the shortest unit of action in the MIDI-verse.  Yes, many ticks<br/>&gt;will not feature a change (although not as many as one might think,<br/>&gt;since event loudness is sampled at each tick), but the thing is: ain&apos;t<br/>&gt;nothin&apos; gettin&apos; past this baby.</p><p>OK, fine...  As I&apos;ve written on this list, I tend to bypass the MIDI<br/>time scheme in favor of naked .001 sec &quot;ticks&quot;, to prevent undesired<br/>shoe-horning of rolled chords into block ones.  Your method could just<br/>go from midi event to midi event, skipping past empty ticks.</p><p>As always, I say, go for it, Carl!  None of these challenges, or the<br/>other ones you face, are insurmountable.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=7986 href="#7986">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2000 12:36:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Mmmm.

But, keeping in mind<br/>that it re-evaluates the type of chord sounding at every tick, I don&apos;t<br/>think it would suffer from the problem you&apos;re thinking of.</p><p>&gt;So... if the first chord is an augmented triad, or full diminished<br/>&gt;chord, how will it be tuned?  Symmetry in, asymmetry out: a tough<br/>&gt;proposition.</p><p>The chords are tuned by way of a lookup table.  There may be several<br/>19-limit chords that resemble a &quot;full diminished chord&quot; in sound (if you<br/>mean a diminished 7th chord, 10:12:14:17 is one example).</p><p>My method trys to squeeze as many consonant relationships out of 12-tone as<br/>possible.  Erlich&apos;s method takes the opposite approach, ignoring anything<br/>that isn&apos;t a simple 5-limit consonance.  That seems the ideal method for<br/>rendering classical music as it was meant to be heard.  Of course, extended<br/>meantone already does an excellent job, but it makes sense to hide the<br/>errors horizontally rather than vertically, since you can, and the improved<br/>fifths do make a difference.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s hard for me to believe you&apos;ll be satisfied with that!  Drift<br/>&gt;control is challenging, but, IMHO, all but essential.</p><p>The important thing is: drift from what?  Not all music depends on the<br/>vanishing of the syntonic comma.  Progressions are possible that would go<br/>sharp in meantone.</p><p>The other thing is, my version doesn&apos;t completely ignore drift.  As I said,<br/>I use 12-tet as the ideal in horizontal motion.  How?  1.) In the lookup<br/>table, chords are penalized for their deviation from 12, and 2.) if there<br/>aren&apos;t any common tones between adjacent chords, the 12-tet motion is taken<br/>as ideal (see adaptive.txt).</p><p>&gt;&gt;Nope.  In a way, I&apos;m actually after &quot;strict&quot; JI here.

The diamond is<br/>a pitch set formed by a group of connected hexads.  In Wilson&apos;s chart each<br/>hexad is a pentagon, and each vertex is a note (the 6th note is at the<br/>center of the pentagon).  Otonal hexads point up, utonal hexads point down.<br/> See them in there?  Notice the progression of hexads around the outside of<br/>star -- each pair of chords is connected by a common dyad.
