I took the bait and<br/>answered.  A couple days later I happened to call a<br/>microtonal friend, a person whose name we all know, to<br/>inquire about something or other (I&apos;ve forgotten<br/>what).  In passing, he mentioned that he&apos;d read my<br/>recent post.</p><p>After the phone call ended I was running the<br/>conversation back through my mind and I remembered<br/>that when he had mentioned reading my earlier post, he<br/>had &quot;left the subject hanging&quot;, as if he had had<br/>something more to say about it, but I had changed the<br/>subject and we had never gotten back to it.  I<br/>ruminated on this for a few seconds, letting the<br/>content of my post run through my mind.  Suddenly it<br/>hit me:  I had made a grotesque error in my little<br/>tables of the powers of 2 and the powers of 3 - I had<br/>written that 3^2 = 6 instead of 3^2 = 9.</p><p>This was even more embarrasing because I continued<br/>barging ahead and even managed to &apos;prove&apos;, using my<br/>faulty table, that no power of 3 can ever equal any<br/>power of 2.</p><p>Anyone can make a mistake, of course, but what has<br/>seemed odd to me is that a month has passed and no one<br/>has called my attention to the error.  The only<br/>mention of my fault-ridden post was someone&apos;s post<br/>praising it!  When I detect someone making an error, I<br/>let them know about it.  If I make an error, my hope<br/>is that my friends and colleagues will let me know<br/>about it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>                            -- Mark Rankin</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
