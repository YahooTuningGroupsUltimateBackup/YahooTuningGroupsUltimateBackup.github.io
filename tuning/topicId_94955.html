While there is still obviously a case to be made for<br/>transpositional-invariant keyboards, it is my opinion that<br/>transpositionally-noninvariant keyboards should be explored as well. I think<br/>that the Halberstadt, in particular, has a number of distinct advantages<br/>that aren&apos;t usually discussed round these parts:</p><p>1) It makes easily accessible certain prioritized scales, which can be of<br/>great use for people who are just learning the instrument. The natural way<br/>to arrange the keys are in terms of two complementary MOS&apos;s, since the MOS&apos;s<br/>of any tuning add to form another MOS. However, this is not a requirement.<br/>2) It makes certain keys easier to play than others, which is either a bug<br/>or a feature, depending on your preference. Thus alternative Halberstadts<br/>may be a natural setup for unequal or circulating temperaments.<br/>3) It will probably be somewhat intuitive for existing keyboard players to<br/>make the switch, as the proprioceptive cues that they are accustomed to can<br/>also apply here.<br/>4) They prioritize melodic relationships in such a way that certain<br/>generalized keyboards do not. 1 out of 31 on an Axis harmonic table layout,<br/>for example, is going to be much further away than whatever 5/4 is mapped<br/>to. This means that while Halberstadts aren&apos;t so great for ease of playing<br/>harmony, they may offer some advantages for melodic playing and soloing.</p><p>So while the Bosanquet keyboard is akin to, say, Esperanto, the notion of<br/>extending the Halberstadt layout is more like Interlingua: it is not<br/>designed to be &quot;tuning neutral&quot; or anything like that, but rather to pick up<br/>on and emphasize the cues that existing keyboard players have.</p><p>The problem is that once you get much past 12, the Halberstadt layout<br/>quickly becomes impractical if only two tiers are involved. 19-equal, for<br/>example, lends itself to a 12+7 layout for prioritizing meantone. This makes<br/>it pretty difficult to hit an octave. The solution, as I see it, is to come<br/>up with a three-tiered Halberstadt system.</p><p>This is far from a complete analysis, but here are some ideas on how to<br/>extend the Halberstadt concept to a three-tiered system. Instead of going<br/>with complementary MOS&apos;s, I went with 22-tet&apos;s complementary pentachordal<br/>major + superpyth[7] + superpyth[5] combo, which combine to form the whole<br/>22-tet set (thanks Paul Erlich). The basic imprint for how the keys are laid<br/>out is this (Fixed width font plz:)</p><p>  |   |    |   |   |    |   |   &lt;-- superpyth[5]<br/> | | | |  | | | | | |  | | | |  &lt;-- SPM<br/>|   |   ||   |   |   ||   |   | &lt;-- superpyth[7]</p><p>or</p><p>  |   |    |   |   |    |   |   &lt;-- superpyth[5]<br/>|   |   ||   |   |   ||   |   | &lt;-- superpyth[7]<br/> | | | |  | | | | | |  | | | |  &lt;-- SPM</p><p>or</p><p> | | | |  | | | | | |  | | | |  &lt;-- SPM<br/>  |   |    |   |   |    |   |   &lt;-- superpyth[5]<br/>|   |   ||   |   |   ||   |   | &lt;-- superpyth[7]</p><p>etc.</p><p>In contrast, 12-equal is obviously this:</p><p> | |  | | | &lt;-- meantone[5]<br/>| | || | | |&lt;-- meantone[7]</p><p>So the basic essence, of the Halberstadt, as I see it, is come up with an<br/>&quot;imprint&quot; for a tuning like the above, and find a way to come up with<br/>irregularly shaped keys that tesselate to fill the whole plane. The 12-tet<br/>approach centers around turning the white keys into keys with &quot;pads&quot; at the<br/>bottom, and the black keys as &quot;stubs&quot; with no pad. This is in opposition to<br/>the Wilson/Fokker/Carlos layout, where the keys are uniformly long and<br/>slender. It also seems that any layout you come up with like this can be<br/>transformed into a transpositionally-invariant hexagonal version, although<br/>that&apos;s something I personally haven&apos;t worked out yet.</p><p>The question becomes, then, how to set the keys up irregularly to accomplish<br/>this objective. I have no idea, so here is an incomplete list of different<br/>options that I&apos;ve been screwing around with so far. All of these have<br/>stupidly irregular key widths because ASCII art is hard. Just imagine<br/>everything is in nice proportion for all three tiers.</p><p>**22-tet - superpyth[5] on top, SPM in the middle, superpyth[7] on bottom**</p><p>A self-similar &quot;fractal&quot;-based approach:</p><p>&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;&boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxv; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxv;&boxv; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxv;&boxv; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxv;&boxv; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv;&boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv;&boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv;&boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv;&boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv;&boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv;&boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv;<br/>&boxv; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxhd;&boxh;&boxul;&boxur;&boxh;&boxhd;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxul; &boxv; &boxur;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxhd;&boxh;&boxul;&boxur;&boxh;&boxh;&boxvh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxul;&boxur;&boxh;&boxhd;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxul; &boxv;<br/>&boxv;     &boxv;    &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;<br/>&boxv;     &boxv;    &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;<br/>&boxv;     &boxv;    &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;<br/>&boxur;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxul;</p><p>**22-tet - SPM on top, superpyth[5] in the middle, superpyth[7] on bottom**</p><p>A different fractal-based approach: The black keys look like &quot;stubs&quot; to the<br/>white keys below, but they look like &quot;pads&quot; for the third tier above.</p><p>&boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;<br/>&boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;<br/>&boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;<br/>&boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;  &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv; &boxv;  &boxv;<br/>&boxv;  &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul;  &boxv;  &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul; &boxur;&boxhd;&boxul;  &boxv;<br/>&boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;<br/>&boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;<br/>&boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;   &boxv;<br/>&boxv;   &boxur;&boxh;&boxhd;&boxh;&boxul;   &boxur;&boxh;&boxhd;&boxh;&boxul;   &boxv;   &boxur;&boxh;&boxhd;&boxh;&boxul;   &boxur;&boxh;&boxhd;&boxh;&boxul;   &boxur;&boxh;&boxhd;&boxh;&boxul;   &boxv;<br/>&boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;<br/>&boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;<br/>&boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;<br/>&boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;     &boxv;       &boxv;       &boxv;     &boxv;<br/>&boxur;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxhu;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxh;&boxul;</p><p>**22-tet - superpyth[5] on top, superpyth[7] in the middle, SPM on bottom!**</p><p>The &quot;different length pads&quot; version.

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen a<br/>notation that isn&apos;t based around a scale of nominals, which<br/>would map to either the black or white keys.</p><p>&gt; So while the Bosanquet keyboard is akin to, say,<br/>&gt; Esperanto, the notion of extending the Halberstadt layout<br/>&gt; is more like Interlingua: it is not designed to be<br/>&gt; &quot;tuning neutral&quot; or anything like that, but rather to<br/>&gt; pick up on and emphasize the cues that existing keyboard<br/>&gt; players have.</p><p>Should we all look up &quot;Interlingua&quot; to understand this?</p><p>&gt; The problem is that once you get much past 12, the<br/>&gt; Halberstadt layout quickly becomes impractical if only<br/>&gt; two tiers are involved. 19-equal, for example, lends<br/>&gt; itself to a 12+7 layout for prioritizing meantone. This<br/>&gt; makes it pretty difficult to hit an octave. The solution,<br/>&gt; as I see it, is to come up with a three-tiered<br/>&gt; Halberstadt system.</p><p>Yes.

I don&apos;t think it&apos;s<br/>worth working out the extended pentatonic notation because<br/>the diatonic notations are too well established, but if<br/>anybody out there&apos;s even crazier than me, why not give it a<br/>try?</p><p>                              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=94961 href="#94961">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2010 7:56:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I started investigating how to generalize the Halberstadt layout<br/>&gt; for other tunings besides 12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) It will probably be somewhat intuitive for existing keyboard<br/>&gt; players to make the switch, as the proprioceptive cues that they<br/>&gt; are accustomed to can also apply here.</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s a really obvious advantage.

This means that while Halberstadts aren&apos;t so<br/>&gt; great for ease of playing harmony, they may offer some advantages<br/>&gt; for melodic playing and soloing.</p><p>That makes sense to me, too.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is far from a complete analysis, but here are some ideas on<br/>&gt; how to extend the Halberstadt concept to a three-tiered system.<br/>&gt; Instead of going with complementary MOS&apos;s, I went with 22-tet&apos;s<br/>&gt; complementary pentachordal major + superpyth[7] + superpyth[5]<br/>&gt; combo, which combine to form the whole 22-tet set (thanks Paul<br/>&gt; Erlich).</p><p>Ey, that&apos;s a cool property. It indeed suggests that layouts based on Halberstadt can work sort of naturally for 22edo.</p><p>I would opt for superpyth[7] on bottom and superpyth[5] in the middle, since that gives a standard Halberstadt. (Although it has to be noted that the 2 superpyths do not combine to a superpyth[12] - else the complemente would not be a decatonic pentachord scale.)</p><p>I just tried out the followng: taking the Kotschy layout (<a href="http://www.newkeyboard.de">http://www.newkeyboard.de</a>) as a model and modifying it, I came up with:</p><p><a href="https://share.ols.inode.at/Q4RVQCF214D36AKZ70W9KXS8J5ASXA8ODYJ5AY6B">https://share.ols.inode.at/Q4RVQCF214D36AKZ70W9KXS8J5ASXA8ODYJ5AY6B</a></p><p>The numbers indicate 22edo steps.

In our meantone-based naming convention, E-F is<br/>shorter than D-E, but that doesn&apos;t bother anyone. We could come up with a<br/>notation system in 12-equal based on two interlocking 6-tet scales, as in<br/>the Janko keyboard, in which the note names are C D E F G A and their<br/>corresponding sharps and flats, which would be tempered together in 12-equal<br/>but not 18-equal. I find that type of structure to be overly mechanical and<br/>perhaps tends better to a serialist composer.</p><p>I think that the notion of defining a keyboard around some &quot;archetypical&quot;<br/>scale is so important to how we&apos;ve been playing, thinking of, and writing<br/>music that there&apos;s no need to do anything like the above. Maybe the best way<br/>to go is pick some kind of maximally even 7-note scale so that all of the<br/>7-note MOS&apos;s in the tuning system will be nearby.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So while the Bosanquet keyboard is akin to, say,<br/>&gt; &gt; Esperanto, the notion of extending the Halberstadt layout<br/>&gt; &gt; is more like Interlingua: it is not designed to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;tuning neutral&quot; or anything like that, but rather to<br/>&gt; &gt; pick up on and emphasize the cues that existing keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; players have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Should we all look up &quot;Interlingua&quot; to understand this?</p><p>Interlingua is a constructed language that kind of looks like Latin. Its<br/>goal is to be recognizable to the majority of Romance language speakers<br/>without much or any additional training. It is also sort of recognizable to<br/>&quot;educated&quot; English speakers who are used to dealing with Latin roots and can<br/>recognize a lot of Interlingua words that way.</p><p>Interlingua is also biased towards Romance language speakers, and people who<br/>speak, say, Arabic won&apos;t have an easy time learning it. Esperanto, on the<br/>other hand, aims to be a &quot;politically neutral&quot; language that is easy for<br/>everyone to learn and takes advantage of several &quot;features&quot; that don&apos;t exist<br/>in natural languages. Don&apos;t ask me what they are, because I don&apos;t speak<br/>Esperanto.</p><p>In short, Esperanto&apos;s goal is to be easily learnable, and Interlingua&apos;s goal<br/>is to be highly comprehensible to existing Romance speakers.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The problem is that once you get much past 12, the<br/>&gt; &gt; Halberstadt layout quickly becomes impractical if only<br/>&gt; &gt; two tiers are involved. 19-equal, for example, lends<br/>&gt; &gt; itself to a 12+7 layout for prioritizing meantone. This<br/>&gt; &gt; makes it pretty difficult to hit an octave. The solution,<br/>&gt; &gt; as I see it, is to come up with a three-tiered<br/>&gt; &gt; Halberstadt system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. And to go into the details you&apos;ll need to make a load<br/>&gt; of prototypes to test out.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s where I get off the train.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Alternate 12-equal that has 5 as the white keys and 7 as<br/>&gt; &gt; the black keys. The white key widths are distorted and<br/>&gt; &gt; severely out of proportion because I hate ASCII art:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I firmly believe that 5 nominals would make more sense for<br/>&gt; heavily chromatic music than 7, but I don&apos;t think anybody&apos;s<br/>&gt; come up with a pentatonic notation for this purpose.</p><p>Why do you think that?</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s probably because diatonic scales tend to precede<br/>&gt; chromatic ones in musical evolution. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; worth working out the extended pentatonic notation because<br/>&gt; the diatonic notations are too well established, but if<br/>&gt; anybody out there&apos;s even crazier than me, why not give it a<br/>&gt; try?</p><p>Maybe that would have some application for superpyth[12], where you have 5+7<br/>scales instead of 7+5.</p><p>Here&apos;s a diagram for how a 5+7 notation system might work.

I dunno.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In short, Esperanto&apos;s goal is to be easily learnable, and<br/>&gt; &gt; Interlingua&apos;s goal is to be highly comprehensible to<br/>&gt; &gt; existing Romance speakers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the Bosanquet keeps the 7 note MOS in a row, so it<br/>&gt; shouldn&apos;t be that hard to learn.  People who have learned<br/>&gt; it say it wasn&apos;t so difficult.  There&apos;s also a fair bit of<br/>&gt; Esparanto you can understand without studying it, if you<br/>&gt; already know some European languages.</p><p>I think that I&apos;d really enjoy having a generalized keyboard. I think I wouldn&apos;t be happy unless I had something like a Scalatron or a similar layout. I&apos;ve looked at the AXiS and it seems really weird (they&apos;ve oriented the hexagons strangely), but I&apos;ll probably get one because it&apos;s cheap. I also think a generalized keyboard would be nice for anyone who wants to play in more than one tuning.</p><p>But here&apos;s another scenario where mapping out the Halberstadt would be useful: let&apos;s say that it&apos;s the year 2020 AD, and let&apos;s say this stuff has finally caught on by then. I think it&apos;s most likely that it&apos;ll start with people picking one equal temperament to obsess on for a while, and that&apos;ll be the catalyst for some kind of revolution whereby people rediscover everything that&apos;s everyone&apos;s developed on this list (hopefully academia will have caught on by then).</p><p>So let&apos;s say it&apos;s 19-tet or 22-tet or something that suddenly goes viral, and that gains a reputation amongst hip artsy college music students for being a hip new alternate &quot;number of notes per octave&quot; tuning system that&apos;s different than 12.</p><p>I think in that case it&apos;ll be useful for there to be some kind of &quot;standardized&quot; 19/22/whatever-tet accretion keyboard for people to start out with, since transpositional or tuning invariance won&apos;t be a big deal at that point yet.</p><p>And note how popular the 16-tet 9+7 Goldstein layout has become. Fleshing out the ergonomics (and maybe even aesthetic appeal) of a three-rank accretion keyboard would make practical higher-numbered ET&apos;s, which would provide for a few attractive &quot;beginner&quot; options for whatever lucky ET ends up in the spotlight. I have doubts accretion layouts would ever work for really high numbered ET&apos;s though (I think 31 is pushing it).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. And to go into the details you&apos;ll need to make a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; load of prototypes to test out.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s where I get off the train.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re better off getting a generalized<br/>&gt; keyboard and making do for all practical purposes.</p><p>If I had any idea how to build a prototype, I would. Where do I even start? Do I use legos? I don&apos;t even know where to start...</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I firmly believe that 5 nominals would make more sense<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for heavily chromatic music than 7, but I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody&apos;s come up with a pentatonic notation for this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Why do you think that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because you can get the full 12 note scale with a single<br/>&gt; pair of accidentals, but only 5 nominals instead of 7.  So<br/>&gt; the music would be slightly more compressed, meaning you can<br/>&gt; get more on a page, with no more cognitive load.</p><p>Well I&apos;ve posted the PDF up, so maybe you can take the concept somewhere. You&apos;d need a much larger staff though, I think. I gave the notes names 1-5, but I think that&apos;s cliche and played out.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=94986 href="#94986">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2010 3:48:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote :</p><p>&gt; I started investigating how to generalize the Halberstadt layout &gt; for other<br/>&gt; tunings besides 12.

The white keys join near the middle of the blak keys, but are not represented here except between consecutive white keys.</p><p>Let &apos;s start with the Golden meantone disk, based on the fractal Phi waveform :<br/><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/sM34TAgaJc50laIaj7CsUDxWvVEhS5V1oDxir1ZFsahkrQUkYWtCNWpkVCNYDc56Ed4-RohAhhpm2bSsWETY2bWgN18SdEsR9w/JacquesDudon/Golden_1267.pdf">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/sM34TAgaJc50laIaj7CsUDxWvVEhS5V1oDxir1ZFsahkrQUkYWtCNWpkVCNYDc56Ed4-RohAhhpm2bSsWETY2bWgN18SdEsR9w/JacquesDudon/Golden_1267.pdf</a><br/>The 12 keys of the Halberstadt with its 5 black keys can be easily seen at the first ring from the center. But that&apos;s only for this ring, because the next developments to 19, 31, 50 tones show different patterns for the black keys, packed by two or one only, instead of packs of 2 and 3. The substitution rule between one ring and the next goes forever like this : one black interval changes into a white, and a white divides into one white and one black. This follows endlessly the Fibonacci infinite word, so this design certainly shows numerous common proportions between intervals, and is approached within an infinity of MOS levels (5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81, 131, 212..., without never been swallowed by any), but in the end it is not typically characteristic of the Halberstadt layout.</p><p>Let see the Aksaka disk now, that shows also a similar Halberstadt layout on ring 3 and its further fractal developments in 29 tones and 70 tones per octave :<br/><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/sM34TBjIBoN0laIatx9FhuCJ7toWrFv0symA_7s1M4kCuc6-n6oCk-2SJDoLKZWt5KkvUshNwkgQiDlYyZmlS-wFHWQ8Bi7BKA/JacquesDudon/Aksaka_1266.pdf">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/sM34TBjIBoN0laIatx9FhuCJ7toWrFv0symA_7s1M4kCuc6-n6oCk-2SJDoLKZWt5KkvUshNwkgQiDlYyZmlS-wFHWQ8Bi7BKA/JacquesDudon/Aksaka_1266.pdf</a><br/>Now we see the Halberstadt original patterns are respected all the way and with the same proportions :<br/>White key/Back key = minor third/wholetone = fifth/fourth = octave+fourth/octave etc. = sqrt of 2,  or :<br/>(Black key) : Whole tone : Fourth : Octave : Fourth and 2 octaves... etc. follow the same proportion of sqrt of 2 + 1.<br/>For example, the 29 tones octave layout in its [tetrachord+wholetone+tetrachord] division uses the same design as the [octave+fourth+octave] (=12+5+12keys) of the precedent 12 tones Halberstadt layout, and the substitution rule for Aksaka&apos;s infinite word goes forever like this : one black interval divides into a white+black, and a white divides into two whites and one black.<br/>Another valid sequence, such as [F#... C] could also follow the same patterns with respectively 7, 17, 41, or 99 keys.<br/>While with the Golden meantone, the numbers of white and black keys were converging towards a Phi proportion, in Aksaka sequences the numbers of white keys over the black keys converges to sqrt of 2 ~1,414.<br/>Of course past 12 notes the octaves would be quite unplayable I admit, unless for guys with very large hands, but as you very well showed in your propositions certainly three rows could be arranged here too.<br/>It must be mentionned that these fractal layouts do not only define keys arrangements, but mainly fractal proportions between intervals and therefore suggest very precise generator solutions, for what I call &quot;meta-versions&quot; of the temperaments. Those are of course not tuning obligations for a  keyboard but interesting to know as central temperaments  :<br/>The Golden meantone meta-temperament fifth generator is 696.214473955 c.,<br/>while Aksaka&apos;s slightly extended fifth is worth of (2 - sqrtof 2) octaves or 702.9437253 c., which qualifies best, according to Graham&apos;s list, for Undecental or perhaps even Dominant temperaments. That&apos;s funny, because the Halberstadt keyboard served mostly for meantone, and as we see the more specific fractal model of Halberstadt is not a Meantone. We can verify the main MOS cycles of this generator are 12, 29, 70, with secondary cycles at 17, 41, 99.</p><p>Both of these fractal patterns I have been using for sounds and rhythms since the beginning of my photosonic disks and both are excellent.<br/>I would like to say more about the rhythms and why I call the second one &quot;Akaska&quot;, but I must go, it will be for a another time.<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=94987 href="#94987">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2010 4:14:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;battaglia01&quot; &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The unequal nature of the diatonic does, indeed, bother<br/>&gt; &gt; some people.

We can verify the main MOS cycles &gt; of this generator are 12, 29, 70, with secondary cycles at 17, 41, 99.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you say &quot;the more specific fractal model,&quot; you mean that it<br/>&gt; produces combinations of ,&apos;,&apos;, and ,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,?</p><p>Yes, the full Halberstadt pattern gets repeated at all scales as part of the Akasaka infinite word, while with The Golden scale it was only an &quot;accident&quot;.

I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sure if 31 would be so successful. But then again, if one could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; organize 31 into a clever 4-rank system, and one in which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-similarity is generally present, then maybe so.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 31 is much easier than 22 at the 5 limit, and the two are about equally easy at both the 7 and 11 limits. For a tempered 4:5:6:7:9:11 chord, 31 actually spans fewer generators in the chain of fifths than does 22, so the amount of vertical (y-axis) reach is less; however, whenever alternate (duplicate) keys are used, the duplicates are one row closer in 22. All things considered, 31 and 22 are about the same difficulty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you talking about with a Bosanquet layout, or with a<br/>&gt; Halberstadt...?</p><p>I&apos;m talking about a Bosanquet layout.</p><p>&gt; I meant that I think setting up an &quot;accretion&quot; design<br/>&gt; might work well for certain tunings, say 19 or 22, just like the 9+7<br/>&gt; layout Halberstadt design is quickly becoming popular for 16-tet. I<br/>&gt; have doubts a Halberstadt design would be useful for something like<br/>&gt; 53-tet (you&apos;d have to have like what, 5-6 ranks of keys to make that<br/>&gt; work? That&apos;s a pretty steep learning curve). A generalized keyboard<br/>&gt; might be better there.</p><p>I can see no advantage for an &quot;accretion&quot; design for any tuning whatsoever.  To start with, the Halbertstadt is much less efficient than than a Bosanquet keyboard even for 12.  E.g., with a Halberstadt, you have 4 different patterns for a major 3rd (C-E, D-F#, Eb-G, and F#-A#), and dissimilar intervals also share these same patterns (D-F same pattern as C-E, F-Bb same as D-F#, F#-B same as G#-C).  When you add keys for something even as simple as 19, it gets even more complicated, because you have to learn even more patterns for a major 3rd (e.g., C#-E#, D#-Fx=Gb), and some patterns will have to re-learned, such as Db-F, which will no longer work with the C#-F pattern, since Db is no longer on the C# key.  This also carries over to other intervals, such as the minor 3rd, major 2nd, major &amp; minor 6th, etc.  Plus, you have to learn new patterns in each of 19 keys for the more dissonant intervals in 19, such as augmented 5th, augmented 6th, augmented 2nd, and diminished 7th.  IMO, it&apos;s a nightmare!</p><p>With the Bosanquet, it takes no more than a minute to learn the 5+7+5 (dark-light-dark) key pattern that clearly identifies the sharp, natural, and flat keys.  Then add a row of 7 light keys above &amp; below this to include double-sharps and double-flats.  Anything you learn in one key is instantly transposable to any other key.</p><p>After you&apos;ve learned 19, you can use the same keyboard for 22.  The primes will be in different locations than with 19, so you&apos;ll need to learn a new set of patterns for the intervals, but you&apos;ll need to learn the patterns in only one key.</p><p>I&apos;ve never experiences any confusion having different patterns for different tunings.  I find that the differences in &quot;mood&quot; between tunings is a sufficient reminder of how to navigate the keyboard to play various intervals.  For example, with 22 you&apos;re constantly aware of the exaggerated (54-cent) comma and widely tempered 5:6 (minor 3rd), which require fingering patterns unique to 22.  Another cue is the very different sound of the intervals approximating ratios of 7 in 19 vs. 22 vs. 31.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=95032 href="#95032">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2010 7:30:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all,</p><p>For visual entertainment and eventual microtonal applications, one simple representation of fractal Persi, alias Hemififth meta-temperament :</p><p><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cPr8TP85YgS2v5YlJ_rbB7qbAbykx0DA1OMuTJ5xVA8iPW52h--EnqHoQvtSM3et3HWPzSm8DHdS0nk04-7WP2YSzzjH65piog/JacquesDudon/Persi-Hemififth_1269.pdf">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cPr8TP85YgS2v5YlJ_rbB7qbAbykx0DA1OMuTJ5xVA8iPW52h--EnqHoQvtSM3et3HWPzSm8DHdS0nk04-7WP2YSzzjH65piog/JacquesDudon/Persi-Hemififth_1269.pdf</a></p><p>(Find it my TL files)</p><p>1 circle = 1 octave<br/>1st black arc in the center = hemififth generator -<br/>as we can see on the following rings it becomes divided like the octave is (LLLs) :<br/>octave = 3 hemififths (~49/40) and one neutral second (~99/91) ;<br/>hemififth = 3 semitones (~ 52/49) and one quartertone (~41/40) ;<br/>etc. forever in same proportions.<br/>Zooming back we could also say that the generator is one octave, inside a period (= 1 circle) of 3 octaves and a fourth.<br/>With the beginning of black arcs the sequence describes systems of 3, 10, 3, 116 notes /octave<br/>or 4, 14, 48, 164 in option (when using the narrower blacks).<br/>Considering the white arcs as white keys and the black ones as black keys, it suggests also some funny keyboards with 7, 24, 82, etc. keys/octave.</p><p>This second disk is the second option I mentionned for the Aksaka_1266 previously described :</p><p><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cPr8TFSOwMa2v5YlULZs2tpe5oIhXJ0EvVslPwT7QmfJtEyrGvFI9nN0CRkhVk3z_lmzXv4itAjVMRiqeUP4BubGnYoIq8U_bA/JacquesDudon/Aksaka-Hemififth_1268.pdf">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cPr8TFSOwMa2v5YlULZs2tpe5oIhXJ0EvVslPwT7QmfJtEyrGvFI9nN0CRkhVk3z_lmzXv4itAjVMRiqeUP4BubGnYoIq8U_bA/JacquesDudon/Aksaka-Hemififth_1268.pdf</a></p><p>with a 3, 7, 17, 41, 99 (alternatively total keys, or number of black keys) sequence instead of the former 2 5 12 29 70 that were not integrating the hemififth.<br/>It&apos;s not a Persi but an Aksaka sequence, with the interest in this one to integrate the hemififths (that&apos;s for example the interval between the most lined-up black keys), and this with the Halberstadt pattern again.
