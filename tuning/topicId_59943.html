Henry George Farmer in &ldquo;The<br/>  Music of Islam&rdquo; states that Ibn Sina does not &ldquo;admit<br/>  the &lsquo;anterior&rsquo; fret at 90 cents, but furnishes the<br/>  just semitone of 112 cents in its place&rdquo;.<br/>  Unfortunately, throughout this article, Farmer does<br/>  not state ratios, but cents only. 112 cents would<br/>  imply a ratio of 16/15, but I do not understand the<br/>  rationale behind this ratio.<br/>  This mujannab second is important, because several<br/>  makams require it, and good Ney players will treat it<br/>  ever so differently. Theoretically, both the Kurdi and<br/>  Segah makam start with the same interval, but the good<br/>  players will widen the Segah minor second a little bit<br/>  more than the Kurdi second. If my ears are worth<br/>  anything than we are talking differences of less than<br/>  a comma, but they are audible, and emotionally very<br/>  effective.<br/>  I checked Cris Forster&rsquo;s website and Dave Benson&rsquo;s<br/>  paper, but they talk about fourths, fifths, major and<br/>  minor thirds, but not about minor seconds. As I am<br/>  only beginning to work myself into intonation<br/>  questions, I don&rsquo;t understand why Farmer uses the term<br/>  &ldquo;just intonation&rdquo; for those 112 cents. Can anybody<br/>  explain it to me?<br/>  Thank you,<br/>  Michael</p><p>  ___________________________________________________________<br/>  Yahoo!

If the stubborn elders and their underlings resist, then we need only wait them to perish for the ripe generation to accept the facts openly.</p><p>From the way things are going, Maqam Music education has degraded itself these past decades so much so that nothing at all makes sense anymore to its pupils. The minds of the students of the traditional culture are clogged with the artefacts of the last century. The number of practiced maqams and their scale structures have been simplified to the extent of sacrificing grace and subtlety. Add to this the aggravation resulting from a lack of proper-historically consistent terminology, it is understandable that most people are not even aware how the genre known as Turkish Maqam Music came to be.</p><p>Hopefully, with the passing away of the seniors conditioned by the AEU system, the path is now paved for the much-anticipated reform and a return to our true historical roots without any references to an ideological propaganda (nationalism).</p><p>Our notayaz group has been actively pursuing this matter since its foundation the past year and a half. The repertory is in shambles. Nothing is written with regard to publishing rules. No editions exist, music scores are childishly prepared. Everything is sketchy, amatuerish and flawed. All must be prepared once more with the right instrumentation in mind.</p><p>I have diligently fought against all the outrageous notions concerning the wrong usage of the staff notation. To me, limma-alterations in a 53-tET context is an intolerable violation of an uninterrupted cycle of fifths, and I&apos;m sure George Secor and others will agree with me here.</p><p>Thus, I find the Arab notation to be much more consistent, although I dislike their abuse of the concept of Key Transposition which should not be practiced by such instruments as the Oud, Tanbur and Violin since the pitch-finger mapping for these instruments cannot be linear in every degree of transposition.</p><p>We need as little symbols as possible in defining the complexity of the Maqam World and we need to utilize the ones we already know in an admissible fashion.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Michael Zapf<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 29 A&gbreve;ustos 2005 Pazartesi 19:25<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Ibn Sina&rsquo;s mujannab</p><p>  Ozan Yarman wrote:<br/>  &lt; I am concerned that 53-tET is just too bland a<br/>  resolution (with the wrong notational scheme) to<br/>  explain the pitches used in Maqam Music.&gt;</p><p>  &gt;From listening and playing I know that half-commas are<br/>  important.
