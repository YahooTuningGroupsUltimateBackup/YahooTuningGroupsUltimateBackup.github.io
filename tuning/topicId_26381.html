I agree!  So, I&apos;ve taken a sequence of Albeniz-Godowsky<br/>&quot;Tango&quot;, sequenced by Robert Finley, and made two sequences for<br/>comparison.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying what tuning(s) are in use; I _might_ have even used the<br/>same tuning in both files, just to see whether the ear is fooled ;-&gt; .</p><p>Please participate!  There&apos;ll be a poll where you can register your<br/>preference, or call the two a toss-up.  I&apos;m posting this to more than<br/>one group; if you belong to two or more, please vote only once.</p><p>To download the small zip of two General MIDI (GM) tunings, go to the<br/>file area of this group, change into the JdL directory, and download<br/><a href="http://tango.zip">tango.zip</a>.  The file tango.txt explains more, and is included below.</p><p>Thanks!!</p><p>JdL</p><p>[contents of tango.txt:]<br/>This .zip file contains two tunings of Albeniz-Godowsky &quot;Tango&quot;,<br/>sequenced by Robert Finley:</p><p>   tango_m.mid<br/>   tango_x.mid</p><p>The letter suffixes were chosen randomly, and should not be construed<br/>to have any meaning connected to the tuning used.  Nor should the<br/>fact that &apos;m&apos; comes ahead of &apos;x&apos; in the alphabet be construed to mean<br/>anything.</p><p>The two files may be tuned identically, or may be different from each<br/>other.  If they are different, one may be 12-tET, or neither may be<br/>12-tET.</p><p>Ideally, the file you first listen to should be chosen randomly.</p><p>The piece is 2 min 36 sec long.  It is perfectly permissible to listen<br/>only to a fraction of one, then a fraction of the other.</p><p>There will be a poll in which you may register your tuning preference:</p><p>   . I prefer tuning m.<br/>   . I prefer tuning x.<br/>   . I experienced no significant preference.</p><p>A General-MIDI (GM) compliant sound card or module is required to hear<br/>these files correctly.  If in doubt, listen; if notes are missing,<br/>there&apos;s a problem.</p><p>The MIDI bend range should be set to default: +/- 2 semitones.  The<br/>file gm_reset.mid should ensure this to be the case.</p></div>
