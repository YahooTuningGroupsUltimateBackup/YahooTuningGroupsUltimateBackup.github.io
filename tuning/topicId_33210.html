I thought most of us had come to the<br/>agreement that RI (rational intonation) is good for describing<br/>*any* rational tuning, and that JI is a subset of that which<br/>exhibits the quality of sonorous &quot;purity&quot; typical of small-integer<br/>ratios.</p><p>Yes, Jacky, your two example chords above are JI.<br/>Yes, they&apos;re RI.  So?  That *STILL* doesn&apos;t change the fact<br/>that the *majority* of writings about JI concern 5-limit and<br/>5-limit *only*.  Modern opinions cannot change what has<br/>already happened -- they can only shed a new perspective on it.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
