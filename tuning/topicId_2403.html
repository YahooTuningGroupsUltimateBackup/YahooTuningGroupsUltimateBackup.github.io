Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/1999 1:11:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and mainly I would like respond to support some of the<br/>points concerning Pythagorean tuning made by Brett Barbaro, and to<br/>expand on a few points concerning stable and _relatively_ concordant<br/>sonorities in some of the main dialects of composed Western European<br/>music during the era 1200-1400 or so.</p><p>First of all, in discussing the problems of evaluating a scale and the<br/>vertical intervals it makes possible, I would emphasize a point which<br/>one of Brett&apos;s messages makes (at least for me) in discussing<br/>technological questions: the best technologies can hardly substitute<br/>for an understanding of the _style_ of music 1000 years old -- or, in<br/>the case of my focus here, between about 600 and 800 years old.</p><p>Secondly, it is a special pleasure on this Tuning List to honor the<br/>germinal contributions of Joseph Yasser in his articles of some 60<br/>years ago on _Medieval Quartal Harmony: A Plea for Restoration_. While<br/>my analysis of medieval polyphony differs significantly in some<br/>respects from Yasser&apos;s, his central point cannot too strongly be<br/>affirmed: medieval polyphony based on stable fifths and fourths is a<br/>&quot;harmonic universe&quot; in its own right, and must be judged in its own<br/>terms.</p><p>Brett has nicely captured one aspect of this universe: the organizing<br/>of an intervallic spectrum in terms of chains of pure fifths. It may<br/>been seen as a delightful form of serendipity that the same tuning<br/>which yields pure fifths and fourths also happens to yield an<br/>intriguing universe of other intervals, and composers from Perotin<br/>(around 1200) through Machaut (c. 1300-1377) and his successors seek<br/>to explore the vertical potential of _all_ these intervals.</p><p>Here it may be well to emphasize that to endorse Pythagorean tuning<br/>for Continental Western European polyphony between 1200 and 1400 is<br/>_not_ to prescribe it for _all_ musics. I would no more recommend<br/>Pythagorean for Palestrina, where thirds and sixths are the principal<br/>concords, than I would recommend 1/4-comma meantone for Perotin, where<br/>Pythagorean is beautifully &quot;in tune&quot; both acoustically and<br/>stylistically. Similarly, it would be rather comically prescriptive to<br/>urge players of 16th-century keyboard music to use a 7:4 minor seventh<br/>because &quot;the normal meantone interval has too high an LCM (infinite<br/>in fact), and so deprives us of one of the most important concords in<br/>music.&quot; Nor, I expect, would even the most ardent lover of the<br/>keyboard music of Cabezon or Byrd demand that barbershop quartet<br/>singers perform in correct Renaissance meantone.</p><p>Marion has raised the interesting issue of why Ancient Greek theorists<br/>were apparently not concerned with polyphony, and here I would like<br/>only to suggest that the use of the Pythagorean scale does not seem to<br/>me a persuasive explanation. From what I understand, for whatever<br/>reasons, the outlook at least of the Greek practice and theory for<br/>which we have evidence was essentially monophonic. Apparently neither<br/>the tuning of the Pythagoreans with its pure ratios of 6:8:9:12, nor<br/>that of Ptolemy with its intervals of 5:4 and 6:5, nor that of<br/>Aristoxenos with its equal semitones, happened to evolve in a musical<br/>milieu oriented toward polyphony.</p><p>However, it also happens that Pythagorean tuning gives superb harmonic<br/>results in the setting of complex Gothic polyphony, and likewise the<br/>tuning of Ptolemy beautifully fits the needs of Renaissance polyphony<br/>(more literally for voices and other non-fixed-pitch instruments, and<br/>with some compromises also on meantone keyboards).</p><p>In becoming &quot;acculturated&quot; to any polyphonic music, be it Gothic or<br/>Renaissance, Romantic or contemporary jazz, one must become at home<br/>with the characteristic scale of vertical tension. From Perotin to<br/>Machaut, this scale is a subtle and graduated one. Thus Jacobus of<br/>Liege (c. 1325) describes the major third (81:64) and major second<br/>(9:8) alike as being &quot;neither perfectly concordant nor perfectly<br/>discordant.&quot; Both are &quot;compatible,&quot; although M3 is somewhat milder or<br/>more blending in itself than M2.</p><p>This nuance of Pythagorean tuning, in which the _relatively_ blending<br/>M3 and m3 are made a bit more tense by their rather complex ratios<br/>while the _relatively_ tense M2 (9:8) and m7 (16:9) are made somewhat<br/>more blending by their pure ratios, is vital to what I&apos;m tempted to<br/>call the &quot;jazzy&quot; quality of much 13th-14th century music.</p><p>In 13th-century music actually beginning a bit before 1200 with<br/>Perotin and his generation, we have something like the following set<br/>of stable or relatively concordant sonorities available in three-voice<br/>writing. Please note that I identify sonorities in a medieval fashion<br/>by giving the outer interval, lower interval, and upper interval: thus<br/>&quot;8|5-4&quot; means &quot;a sonority with outer octave, lower fifth, and upper<br/>fourth.&quot; To clarify what may be an unfamiliar notation, I give also an<br/>example of each sonority, using MIDI-style notation (C4 = middle C) to<br/>show octaves; higher numbers mean higher octaves.</p><p>For each sonority, I give Pythagorean ratios both in medieval terms of<br/>string lengths (&quot;wavelength ratios,&quot; if you like), and in more modern<br/>terms of frequency ratios. Note how 81:64 and 32:27 are relatively<br/>concordant, and how 9:8, 16:9, and 9:4 become relatively concordant<br/>when combined with two ideally blending intervals of the fifth/fourth<br/>class:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                        Richly stable sonorities<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Sonority                  example     string-ratio     frequency-ratio<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>8|5-4                    D3-A3-D4       6:4:3              2:3:4<br/>8|4-5                    D3-G3-D4       4:3:2              3:4:6</p><p>(Both these sonorities are saturated stable concords, but 8|5-4 is<br/>smoother and more conclusive, while 8|5-4 is relatively stable but<br/>less conclusive.)</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>                        Mildly unstable sonorities<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Sonority                  example     string-ratio     frequency-ratio<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5|M3-m3                   G3-B3-D4     81:64:54           64:81:96<br/>5|m3-M3                   A3-C4-E4     96:81:64           54:64:81</p><p>5|4-M2                    G3-C4-D4      12:9:8             6:8:9<br/>5|M2-4                    G3-A3-D4       9:8:6             8:9:12<br/>m7|4-4                    G3-C4-F4      16:12:9            9:12:16<br/>M9|5-5                    G3-D4-A4       9:6:4             4:6:9<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the 13th century, as Brett eloquently puts it, Pythagorean thirds<br/>and also the somewhat more tense major sixth (27:16, a pure fifth plus<br/>a pure 9:8 major second, often ranked with M2) are not &quot;missed<br/>opportunities&quot; but rather realized opportunities for some of the most<br/>memorable cadences in the history of European music. Indeed, even the<br/>strong discords (m2, M7, A4, d5, and often m6) play an essential role<br/>in polyphonic practice, as the theorist Johannes de Garlandia<br/>(c. 1240?) recognizes.</p><p>In the 14th century, this scale of concord shifts somewhat: sixths are<br/>ranked on more of a parity with thirds as relatively concordant, while<br/>fourths above the lowest voice are often regarded as dissonances (a<br/>trend decried by Jacobus, who defends this interval as a full concord,<br/>although more pleasing above the fifth). However, Machaut continues to<br/>use many traditional sonorities such as the major ninth combined with<br/>two euphonious fifths (e.g. F3-C4-G4), while also taking advantage of<br/>combinations involving the Pythagorean major sixth or minor seventh.</p><p>From this perspective, Machaut may have considered traditional<br/>cadential sonorities of the 13th century such as M6|5-M2<br/>(e.g. G3-D4-E4) or m7|5-m3 (e.g. E3-B3-D4) not only as somewhat<br/>&quot;compatible&quot; (they contain no strong discords, and Jacobus admits them<br/>as legitimate combinations), but as independently euphonious to a<br/>degree. Both his &quot;modern&quot; penchant for a freer treatment of thirds and<br/>especially sixths, and his &quot;traditional&quot; appreciation for the milder<br/>aspects of M2 and m7, may contribute to this artistic result.</p><p>Interestingly, such three-voice sonorities nicely &quot;verticalize&quot; the<br/>common names of the Pythagorean major sixth and minor seventh<br/>themselves: respectively _tonus cum diapente_ (tone plus fifth) and<br/>_semiditonus cum diapente_ (minor third plus fifth). Here are ratios<br/>for the two sonorities just described:</p><p>sonority          example        string-ratio     frequency-ratio</p><p>M6|5-M2           G3-D4-E4         27:18:16          16:24:27<br/>m7|5-m3           E3-B3-D4         32:24:18          18:27:32</p><p>Here it would be beyond of this discussion (already long enough!) to<br/>delve into the cadential treatment of these sonorities, vital in the<br/>13th century and an interesting feature also of Machaut and of some<br/>dialects of 14th-century English music, for example. For one analysis,<br/>please feel welcome to visit:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a></p><p>However, joining Brett Barbaro in a celebration of realized<br/>opportunities in Gothic music, I would add that the m7|5-m3 sonority<br/>has a very pleasant quality to my ear, at once &quot;Bluesy&quot; and sweet,<br/>while the M6|5-M2 is positively &quot;vibrant.&quot; At the same time, they are<br/>sonorities of motion, not of rest -- but I could imagine them being<br/>used as very interesting free sonorities in new musics.</p><p>Also, in a 14th-century setting, Pythagorean thirds as well as sixths<br/>have a delightful &quot;bounce.&quot; Those half-cadences on 5|M3-m3 (to Jacobus<br/>the _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; sonority, with the middle voice<br/>&quot;splitting&quot; the fifth into two thirds, e.g. G3-B3-D4) are sweet but<br/>indeed inconclusive. The tuning and the music enhance each other, and<br/>as Brett has said, an opportunity is superbly realized.</p><p>What implications may this discussion have more generally for tuning<br/>theory? I would suggest that in music, as in the study of natural<br/>languages, theories of &quot;universal grammar&quot; can only be as accurate as<br/>the descriptions of the many specific languages on which they are<br/>premised.</p><p>To understand medieval Pythagorean tuning and its possible broader<br/>implications, I would suggest that we begin with the specifics of<br/>13th-14th century vertical style and its interactions with the<br/>tuning. Then we see how these specifics may invite the affirmation or<br/>modification of assumptions about Pythagorean or other just intonation<br/>systems, or about tuning systems in general.</p><p>For example, the musically very effective and beautiful use of 81:64<br/>and 32:27 as _relatively concordant_ intervals (both as defined by the<br/>theorists and as realized in the pieces themselves) may indicate that<br/>any theory of &quot;least common multiple&quot; (LCM) must take account of<br/>this artistic possibility. One conclusion that might be that<br/>perceptions of &quot;concord/discord&quot; are largely conditioned by style; in<br/>a 16th-century setting, where the purity of 5:4 and 6:5 thirds is a<br/>cardinal _desideratum_, Zarlino finds that 81:64 would be a<br/>&quot;dissonance.&quot;</p><p>This does not mean that LCM measures are irrelevant: indeed,<br/>musicians seem often to have a curious habit of seeking low LCM&apos;s<br/>for the most choice concords in their &quot;language&quot; (3:2 and 4:3 in the<br/>Gothic; 5:4 and 6:5 in the Renaissance; 7:4 in barbershop; n:m in<br/>whatever n-limit system one happens to prefer at a given moment).</p><p>Similarly, &quot;two negatives are equivalent to a positive&quot; is a good rule<br/>for many situations in predicate logic, but does not prevent natural<br/>languages such as Spanish and Middle English from using double or<br/>multiple negatives in the sense of negation.</p><p>Further, focusing on the specifics of Gothic style may be only the<br/>beginning of an inquiry into intriguing, if possibly moot, questions<br/>about the fine nuances of tuning this music.</p><p>For example, as Marion has ingeniously asked, might performers<br/>realizing the ideal of a Pythagorean intonation on non-fixed-pitch<br/>instruments tend to shade an 81:64 toward a 19:15, or a 729:612 toward<br/>a 10:7? Focusing on the nature of Pythagorean tuning _as a system_ may<br/>make such questions yet more interesting: for example, would an<br/>alteration of this kind (keeping within a range of ~5 cents)<br/>substantially compromise the purity of fifths and fourths? I look<br/>forward to discussing these points in another post.</p><p>Now, as some 60 years ago when Yasser wrote, the greatest barrier to<br/>an appreciation of Pythagorean tuning in a Gothic setting would seem<br/>still to be an unfamiliarity with the composed European music of this<br/>period and its distinctive vertical style. As Brett has suggested,<br/>this music is an opportunity which I am very glad not to have missed.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
