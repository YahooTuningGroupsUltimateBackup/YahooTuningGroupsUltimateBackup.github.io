It seems appropriate for me, as we look forward<br/>to the &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; project exploring the tunings and modes of<br/>musical cultures familiar and unfamiliar of this and other<br/>planets, to mention a few musical highlights of the contest which<br/>have especially attracted my attention and provided inspiration<br/>for us all.</p><p>At this point I should beg pardon if it would have been better<br/>for me to have joined some established thread for this purpose<br/>rather than starting a new one -- and at the same time to join<br/>Jacques and Francois and others in inviting other people to join<br/>in celebrating the composers, performances, and pieces together<br/>making this contest such an exciting and productive event.</p><p>Singling out these particular pieces is done with the very major<br/>caution that I am still downloading and digesting others, for<br/>example those of Cameron Bobro, so this quick list is anything<br/>but exclusive! And Cameron, thank you for a most insightful<br/>remark on the virtues of the _descending_ semitone as a fine<br/>cadential motion, something that has long captured my imagination<br/>in medieval and Renaissance music of Western Europe, but can have<br/>special ramifications in the traditions of Eastern Europe on<br/>which you have helped to educate me, and also, of course, the<br/>maqam music which influences these traditions.</p><p>First, I would like to congratulate Ozan Yarman on his most<br/>artful _Nishabureyn Peshrev_, noting that my English spelling<br/>reflects the limit of my ISP&apos;s e-mail environment on supporting<br/>character sets -- although they&apos;ve done an upgrade, so I should<br/>check this out anew!</p><p>The mood of this beautiful Ottoman piece reminds me a bit of the<br/>14th-century Italian instrumental genre known as the _Istampita_,<br/>literally a &quot;stamp dance&quot; (like the earlier French _estampie_),<br/>but in fact what I might now term a kind of written-out taksim,<br/>where some scholars have suggested a Near Eastern influence.<br/>You bring to this piece an intimate knowledge of the repertory,<br/>the artistry to act on that knowledge, the technical saavy to use<br/>Ethno2 to best effect, and a sensitivity to the fine points of<br/>intonation, including the value of AEU as a _subset_ of Turkish<br/>intonation, but not the whole!</p><p>My enthusiastic kudos to Naomi O&apos;Sullivan for _Indo-ko-tulu_, a<br/>very creative and beautiful adaptation of the Ethno2 quechua.scl<br/>to a gamelan-like style. The textures, rhythms, and contrapuntal<br/>interweavings are enchanting! It&apos;s fascinating how a South<br/>American scale seems to have certain &quot;pelog-like&quot; features -- and<br/>you&apos;ve made the most of them.</p><p>Chris Vaisvil, your journey to _Socotro Island_ provides an<br/>example of how the languages of world music can travel, and lead<br/>to some interesting borrowings and &quot;translations.&quot; Just as Ozan<br/>Yarman often draws on the harmonic vocabulary of European music<br/>as an element of his own style, so you have drawn on a<br/>traditional modal type of Iran music, Dastgah-e Afshari, to<br/>launch your own exploration into what I might call a kind of<br/>modal jazz. Miles Davis is curiosly one very pleasant association<br/>that comes to me, as I wrote in an earlier post.</p><p>Speaking of creative stylistic mixtures and borrowings done from<br/>a confident stance of artistic integrity, what better example<br/>could there be than the music of Shaahin Mohajera? Shaahin, I<br/>much enjoyed your &quot;Micro&quot; pieces for the Ethno2 contest focusing<br/>on the material of Segah, Shur, and Homayun. Well have you earned<br/>the recognition of the Ethno2 judges for orchestration, something<br/>also wonderfully illustrated in _Rebellious Music_ and _Cyrus the<br/>Great_, for example. As I attempt to learn and improvise in a few<br/>gushe-s of the vast radif, would that I could muster a tenth of<br/>the musicianship and spirit that you bring to composing and<br/>performing alike.</p><p>This is a very partial list in both senses: I have so far sampled<br/>only a limited portion of the impressive collection of music<br/>generated through this contest; and I definitely have my<br/>stylistic &quot;partialities&quot; and preferences which draw me toward<br/>certain pieces. The more we share our personal<br/>highlights of music from this contest, the more representative a<br/>picture we may get, as participants and listeners, of how our<br/>community is growing and creating, with Ethno2 as a means and a<br/>vital catalyst.</p><p>With warmest thanks to Jacques, Francois, and all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
