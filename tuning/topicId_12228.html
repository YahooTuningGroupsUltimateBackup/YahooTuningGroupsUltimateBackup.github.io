When I look into the staff<br/>view it seems to not be able to recognize that the pitch wheel is<br/>being moved. I realize that Cakewalk&apos;s notation capabilities leave<br/>much to be desired, but I am attempting to wrap up my contribution to<br/>Joseph&apos;s Experiment page today and I was wanting to possibly include<br/>a score with it. I thought it might be of interest to have it, to<br/>read along with the music examples.</p><p>Any help would be immeasureably appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
