How is it so?</p><p>Alison:</p><p>&gt;People found it &quot;interesting&quot; which doesn&apos;t say much (psychopaths are &gt;&quot;interesting&quot;)</p><p>Heh, heh...you _know_ you&apos;ve failed when you hear _that word_!</p><p>&gt;I wish someone would tell this to John Adams, who, though anything but a &gt;serialist, is of the opinion that Partch (and Glenn Branca) is &gt; unworthy &gt;of consideration because of his lack of conventional musical &gt; training.</p><p>Well, for my money, I have never found any inspiration in the very few works of Mr. Adams which I can recall hearing, whereas I would claim Partch and Branca as two of my great inspirations.  Perhaps an absence of formal training _helps_?</p><p>Kyle:</p><p>&gt;Doesn&apos;t that beat everything? Publishers won&apos;t take a chance on books on &gt;microtonality by me, or even a genius like Monz, but if you&apos;re a hotshot &gt;academic at some big university with a lot of modernist credentials, &gt;they&apos;ll publish your esoteric 12-tone book and make a big deal out of it &gt;without even reading through it to confirm that it makes any sense.</p><p>All right, all right.  It&apos;s not fair.  I agree.  I&apos;m starting to get sorry now that I ever said anything...</p><p>Gene:</p><p>&gt;The decadisarticulation system</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t have a clue whether it&apos;s more &apos;artificial&apos; than serialism...all I know is that it&apos;s bloody funny, and I might just try it sometime if you&apos;ll let me...with due credit, o&apos;course...</p><p>But, in any case. one of the points I was originally trying to make was that I didn&apos;t understand the difference between a &apos;natural&apos; and an &apos;artificial&apos; &apos;system&apos; of music in the sense employed on this list.  Has there ever been a definition of these two terms?  Is a definition possible?</p><p>Michael:</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think serialism per se, is new. JS Bach used it (in a sense) &gt; with &gt;his use of cantus firmus.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s right.</p><p>&gt;I think the only rule that Schoenberg added was that no note may appear a &gt;second time until all others have been used (he was not the &gt; only one with &gt;that idea either).</p><p>And, in any case, according to what I have heard, he did not originate the tone-row concept anyway; another Viennese musician whose name escapes me had that possibly dubious honour.  Schoenberg merely applied the technique effectively, including, as you said, the idea of expending each note in the row prior to repetition of any note.</p><p>My point was not about whether it is an old or a new technique, but whether it is a valid one.</p><p>Kraig:</p><p>&gt;I have stayed out of this one but since i was brought up, even though<br/>&gt;mistakenly i have a few comments</p><p>OK, OK, I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry!  I already apologised...</p><p>&gt;you assume.<br/>&gt;1. That your subjective response is objective. or to be more generous &gt; &gt;that even a group subjective response can be objective<br/>&gt;wheather a minority or not.<br/>&gt;2. That an objective evaluation of a tuning can be made. This assumes &gt; &gt;that all people hear exactly the same. WHat can you present to prove &gt; this &gt;or that all people want exactly the same thing from music and the way they &gt;tune.<br/>&gt;3. That only one tuning system can be the best.</p><p>Well, if these comments are directed at me, I confess my complete bewilderment.  I am not sure whether I was assuming _anything_!  _I_ was under the impression that I was asking reasonably polite questions, confessing my ignorance, and asking for input on the points I raised.  If I appeared to be doing anything else, then, once again, I apologise most sincerely to anyone whom I have offended.</p><p>I wondered aloud whether there were any other valid criteria for &apos;judging&apos; or &apos;evaluating&apos; (or simply preferring) any given tuning than - in the final analysis - personal preference.  I have no idea what the answer to that question might be, and I am certainly _not_ trying to impose my non-existent idea on the group.  (One brave soul said that there probably _wasn&apos;t_!)</p><p>I am afraid that I also have no idea whatsoever of what you might possibly mean by saying &quot;your subjective response is objective&quot;.  I have racked what brains I have, and gotten no nearer understanding you.  Could you please explain further?</p><p>As to &quot;This assumes that all people hear exactly the same&quot;, I don&apos;t know whether I believe - or assume - that that is the case at all.  I make no claim whatsoever to any expertise in this matter, but I _do_ recall rather dimly an article in Scientific American from the early or mid-1990s which analysed cultural hearing differences between English and American listeners in terms of the music of the Beach Boys and the Beatles, which seemed to suggest that inhabitants of the two nations actually heard certain &apos;harmonies&apos; slightly differently, and that this difference was reflected in the songs written by the two groups.  I suspect that this is very probably true, and maybe even deeply true, to say nothing of different perceptions among more different global cultures.</p><p>May I ask, with respect, exactly what it was that I wrote which causes you to believe that I was making the above assumption?</p><p>&gt;3. That only one tuning system can be the best.</p><p>May I ask, with respect, exactly what it was that I wrote which causes you to believe that I was making the above assumption?</p><p>Kyle:</p><p>&gt;You do know that Schoenberg, the day he wrote his first 12-tone row, wrote &gt;in his journal, &quot;I have discovered today something that will ensure the &gt;supremacy of German music for the next 100 years.&quot;</p><p>&gt;The son of a bitch.</p><p>Yes, indeed he did...and he was wrong!  America won after all with rock &apos;n&apos; roll!  So let&apos;s all lighten up, and give three big cheers for the Musical System of the Next Millennium: THE DECADISARTICULATION SYSTEM!!!  YAY!!!

I can&apos;t remember who, but my astonishment did make me remember the statement!</p><p>Jon,</p><p>While I generally believe that theory should not hamper a composer (poet, painter, creative person, etc.), at the same time, how much of the training that the composer receives, influences what he does? So, in this respect, theory could be considered to proceed practice. (But how do you develope theory without a little practice?) Also, is it possible for a composer to develope in a vaccuum, developing completely on his own? If Harry Partch had not been trained in Traditional Music, would he ever have reached his theories for Just Intonation? Would he have developed the strength it took to forge his own path?</p><p>I do believe this is one reason that Serialism gets some &quot;slightful&quot; looks from composers is it really seems (to me) like you are just doing a &quot;crossword&quot; puzzle, only with notes. At the same time, some of the computer &quot;experiments&quot; that I have done use serial techniques in how the overall events are generated. The resulting overall sound can be quite fascinating, if not to call them musical. I have played with some fractals to generate some granular synthesis &quot;clouds&quot; of sound, and I find the results very pleasing. While these experiments are not following exactly the same theories as Schoenberg&apos;s, but a more generalized serialism, I still think that they both stem from the same compositional theory, maybe on a different scale (or magnitude).</p><p>Even still, how much of the concepts of serialism find their roots in the concept of &quot;cantus firmus&quot;? It was only up to the fanatics of the 20th century that tried to apply these theories to other parameters of music. I do think that there are many interesting things to be done with serialism, it just seems like the study of serialism as offered by the Vienna school is like spending your life living with something you really don&apos;t like in hopes of possibly, possibly, producing something remotely resembling music (or something that I would want to listen to).</p><p>I forget who might have said this, but to paraphrase, &quot;We spend our childhood learning, and our adulthood unlearning.&quot;</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2002 10:09:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon Szanto &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt;&quot;</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41670">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41670</a></p><p>&lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Michael,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael McGonagle &lt;fndsnd@r...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; It is not how much his music fits the theory that makes him<br/>known,<br/>&gt; &gt; on the contrary, he helped set the standards by which our theory<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;says&quot; we must compose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep.
