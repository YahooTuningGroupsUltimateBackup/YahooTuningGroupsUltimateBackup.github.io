Applying these from the fifth as 3/2 and filling out the fourth and flat-fifth gives intervals from the tonic:</p><p>1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 51/32 27/16 57/32 15/8 and of course 2/1.</p><p>PS: I chose 45/32 for flat-fifth because this is the interval between the fourth and major seventh 15/8 x 3/4.</p><p>As you see there&apos;s many familiar intervals here, while intervals between non-tonics also seem to hold together. Or we could apply 16 -20 from fourth and see what happens. I just got a new computer and am not set up yet to test chords on my microtuner yet so I don&apos;t know to what extent we can modulate from this tuning before having to reset the scale for the new key. But it seems to sound nice as is.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83879 href="#83879">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2009 12:57:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Rick,</p><p>see this webpage:<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ganassi/ganassi.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/ganassi/ganassi.htm</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=83882 href="#83882">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2009 4:34:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick~<br/>   there is also a subharmonic scale on page 3, 4th scale down. also a 12 tone scale.

(Funny, John C just sent me an email). Thought it was too obvious not to have been looked at before. I too noticed that if we start from 64 (I&apos;d prefer scientific C rather than C 60 for calculations) we get separations by 4 and then from 96, separations by 6 (although my scale has a pure fourth 4/3 or 85.333...instead of 84). But I don&apos;t know why Ganassi said that G major wasn&apos;t perfect because 9/8 = (3/2)^2?? One interval that does stand out is the minor third from the fourth (51/32)/(4/3) = 153/128 = 1.1953125. Since this lies between 6/5 and 19/16 and has &quot;odd/2^N&quot; then it should still be a good minor third.</p><p>As I mentioned to Marcel, rather than testing the tuning with arbitrary major and minor triads from here and there (especially &quot;subharmonics&quot; which IMO is nonsense), we should try a more modern approach with root-third-seventh and then cycle in the key of C i.e. guide tones of thirds leading to sevenths and vice-versa (More &quot;Monk&quot; than &quot;Mozart&quot;). for eg, as the left hand of a piano plays C F B E A D G C, the right hand plays E-B E-A D-A D-G C-G C-F B-F B-E. Next we can modify chords along the way, for eg preceding all the V I&apos;s by a dominant 7: E-B E-Bb E-A, for C7 to F, or D-G# C#-G C-F# for E7, A7, D7 (chromatic tritones in 12 tET). These last tritones are 51/36 = 1.41666..., 24/17 = 1.411764706 and 45/32 = 1.40625, all of which seem pretty close to the tempered sqrt2 1.41421356. We can then push the limits even further by trying altered chords with these 7ths, 5+ 5- and 9+ 9- etc...If it passes these tests then perhaps we have found a meantone tuning which may be used for more modern 12 tET harmony, at least in the key of C and its satellite keys.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83886 href="#83886">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2009 5:47:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;...I just happened to notice that the harmonics 16:17:18:19:20 give good chromatics from tonic to major third.</p><p>Even more general Rick,<br/>see<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/stevinsp.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/stevinsp.html</a><br/>...&quot;There is a continuous range of semitones with the values 14 : 15 : 16 : 17 : 18 : 19 : 20 : 21, from major semitones 14:15 to minor semitones 20:21....&quot;</p><p>bye<br/>A.S.</p></div><h3><a id=83888 href="#83888">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2009 10:29:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick~<br/>&gt;     there is also a subharmonic scale on page 3, 4th scale down. also a<br/>&gt; 12 tone scale.

By the term &quot;subharmonics&quot; does Wilson just mean the harmonic series inverted eg 4:5:6 becomes 8/5 4/3 ? If so, my question is; isn&apos;t this just a new harmonic series where the original tonic is now placed in the role of upper harmonic? IOW still just the harmonic series? But I suppose that in terms of context this term might make sense.</p><p>Where I&apos;m coming from is that many of the stuff I read about &quot;subharmonics&quot; years ago (don&apos;t ask me where, maybe Helmholtz) is nothing more than the GCD of the plain old harmonic series, gone unrecognised. For eg, it was something like, if you play 5 and 6 together you can sometimes hear a &quot;virtual tonic&quot; or &quot;subharmonic&quot; 1 come out. But this is just the resultant frequency of the wave addition and hence, just the harmonic series.</p><p>On a related note, I did notice the term &quot;Diophantine&quot; in the Wilson doc. Do you know what this all means? It&apos;s just that I&apos;ve been exploring a vague idea that the concept of GCD might be extended to complex numbers (probably Gaussian integers) which sometimes can have more than one. During my Googling travels I came across Diophantine equations which (if I recall correctly) are polynomial equations with GCD&apos;s. My idea is that if we can find a wave application for these then a whole new arena might open up. [I haven&apos;t got very far. Given two Gaussian integers of the form a + bi they can have up to four GCD&apos;s. But if we take a wave with complex exponent we get:<br/>e^i(a + bi)t = e^(ai - b)t = (e^-bt).(e^iat) = e^-bt(cosat + isinat), which is just a damped oscillation. Since periodicity is independent from amplitude, then adding two such waves would only give the usual GCD. IOW I can&apos;t see where the complex GCD&apos;s would fit in].<br/>It just might be that Wilson&apos;s work might already relate to this??</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt; Mesotonal Music from:<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>&gt; this evaporates - an island once again<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83889 href="#83889">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2009 10:47:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andreas Sparschuh&quot; &lt;a_sparschuh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;...I just happened to notice that the harmonics 16:17:18:19:20 give good chromatics from tonic to major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even more general Rick,<br/>&gt; see<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/stevinsp.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/stevinsp.html</a><br/>&gt; ...&quot;There is a continuous range of semitones with the values 14 : 15 : 16 : 17 : 18 : 19 : 20 : 21, from major semitones 14:15 to minor semitones 20:21....&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bye<br/>&gt; A.S.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks A.S,</p><p>Interesting that Galileo&apos;s father Vincenzo entertained and rejected these semitones 14-21.

In fact I&apos;ve been working so long on the maths side without any means of testing the results that I am surprised to learn that 5/4 and 3/2 do not sound as &quot;pure&quot; as the maths seemed to suggest. (OTOH Carl&apos;s low-limit &quot;Barbershop&quot; tunings sounded very harmonic to me so it might be a context or timbre thing?). What&apos;s more, my original theoretical calculation that the tempered minor third would more likely be approximating 19/16 rather than 6/5 seems confirmed, which is ironic since I was basing it on the fact that 5/4 and 3/2 have &quot;prime/2^N&quot;. For the major third and fifth, the intervals I prefer are 161/128 and 191/128 respectively (NB: I think 3/2 might have sounded sharp, not flat).</p><p>As far as your suggested tunings go, I am a rank amateur at both the microtuning software and some of the historical lingo.

First of all, very often, ancient theories about intervals were based on ratios of lengths, not frequencies. These can be either relative string lengths or wavelengths or whatever lengths you choose. This means that a tone with a 1 ms period is one octave higher than 2 ms, and that, for example, 3 ms is a perfect fifth lower than 2 ms, and so on. So if you have periods of 1 ms, 2 ms, 3 ms, 4 ms, etc., you get the subharmonic series whose &quot;guide tone&quot; (the opposite of the fundamental) has the frequency equal to the LCM of all the sounding frequencies, which is, in this case, 1000Hz or a period of 1 ms. -- For another thing, I&apos;m not sure how much you know about overtone singing, but let&apos;s say you want to get an A6 out of your voice&apos;s overtones.

Excuse my stupidity but<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not exactly sure what you mean or how they can be applied.</p><p>What you describe are epimoric intervals (or ratios or factors or whatever you want to call them). ED is the value which determines how close the interval is to an epimoric interval. And also, the larger the value, the closer the interval is to unison (you can&apos;t express an unison as an ED because you would have to use a value of 1/0). If the interval in question is epimoric, then the ED is equal to the denominator of the ratio (that&apos;s why I chose the name). So, let&apos;s say that a pure octave has a ratio of 2/1, which means that the ED for a pure octave is 1 as 2/1 is an epimoric ratio. Similarly, the ratio of a pure fifth is 3/2, which is also an epimoric ratio, and therefore the ED for a pure fifth is 2. You can convert any factor to ED with the formula &quot;1/(f-1)&quot; where &quot;f&quot; is the factor in question, which means that you get 1 for 2/1, 2 for 3/2, and so on. If the ratio is not epimoric, then it can tell you how close it is to an epimoric ratio. For example, if an ED of 1 means an octave and an ED of 2 means a fifth, then an ED of 1.5 means a pure major sixth because this is exactly the &quot;partial&quot; mean of the two former ratios (you can think of them as 4/2 and 6/4 so that there&apos;s 5/3 in the middle). The ED can also tell you which frequencies you would use if you wanted to have a 1Hz difference. For example, to get an octave with a 1Hz difference, you would use 1Hz and 2Hz and the ED is essentially the lower of the two. Similarly, if you wanted to find a pure major sixth with a 1Hz difference, then you would use 1.5Hz and 2.5Hz -- and, again, the ED is the lower of the two. This can be useful if you&apos;re trying to figure out how much detuned an interval is from unison. The lower the value, the larger the detuning.</p><p>&gt; Concerning the subharmonic series, however, one needs to keep track of inversions<br/>&gt; between periods and frequencies on the one hand and inversions between intervals<br/>&gt; on the other. Choosing convenient units where 1 ms is unity, the periods 1 ms, 2 ms, 3 ms<br/>&gt; give frequencies 1, (1/2), (1/3), which have a GCD of (1/6).</p><p>Not sure whether you&apos;re doing this intentionally or not, but you&apos;re completely omitting the LCM. If you tak&eacute; frequencies of 4Hz and 6Hz, then the GCD (or fundamental) is 2 and the LCM (or guide tone) is 12. If you try to, (don&apos;t know what) let&apos;s say, tap 6Hz with one hand and 4Hz with the other, you&apos;ll realize that if you start tapping with both hands at the same time (i.e. the initial tap is with both hands), then the shortest time between two consecutive taps is 1/12 of a second. These &quot;guide tones&quot; are useful for tuners while counting beats in tempered intervals because tempered intervals make them beat. For example, if you mix 200Hz and 301Hz, then the 3rd harmonic of the lower tone is 600Hz and the 2nd harmonic of the higher tone is 602Hz, which results in 2Hz beating (as long as the overtones are audible, of course).

Excuse my stupidity but<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not exactly sure what you mean or how they can be applied.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What you describe are epimoric intervals (or ratios or factors or whatever you want to call them). ED is the value which determines how close the interval is to an epimoric interval. And also, the larger the value, the closer the interval is to unison (you can&apos;t express an unison as an ED because you would have to use a value of 1/0). If the interval in question is epimoric, then the ED is equal to the denominator of the ratio (that&apos;s why I chose the name). So, let&apos;s say that a pure octave has a ratio of 2/1, which means that the ED for a pure octave is 1 as 2/1 is an epimoric ratio. Similarly, the ratio of a pure fifth is 3/2, which is also an epimoric ratio, and therefore the ED for a pure fifth is 2. You can convert any factor to ED with the formula &quot;1/(f-1)&quot; where &quot;f&quot; is the factor in question, which means that you get 1 for 2/1, 2 for 3/2, and so on. If the ratio is not epimoric, then it can tell you how close it is to an epimoric ratio. For example, if an ED of 1 means an octave and an ED of 2 means a fifth, then an ED of 1.5 means a pure major sixth because this is exactly the &quot;partial&quot; mean of the two former ratios (you can think of them as 4/2 and 6/4 so that there&apos;s 5/3 in the middle). The ED can also tell you which frequencies you would use if you wanted to have a 1Hz difference. For example, to get an octave with a 1Hz difference, you would use 1Hz and 2Hz and the ED is essentially the lower of the two. Similarly, if you wanted to find a pure major sixth with a 1Hz difference, then you would use 1.5Hz and 2.5Hz -- and, again, the ED is the lower of the two. This can be useful if you&apos;re trying to figure out how much detuned an interval is from unison. The lower the value, the larger the detuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Concerning the subharmonic series, however, one needs to keep track of inversions<br/>&gt; &gt; between periods and frequencies on the one hand and inversions between intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; on the other. Choosing convenient units where 1 ms is unity, the periods 1 ms, 2 ms, 3 ms<br/>&gt; &gt; give frequencies 1, (1/2), (1/3), which have a GCD of (1/6).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not sure whether you&apos;re doing this intentionally or not, but you&apos;re completely omitting the LCM. If you tak&eacute; frequencies of 4Hz and 6Hz, then the GCD (or fundamental) is 2 and the LCM (or guide tone) is 12. If you try to, (don&apos;t know what) let&apos;s say, tap 6Hz with one hand and 4Hz with the other, you&apos;ll realize that if you start tapping with both hands at the same time (i.e. the initial tap is with both hands), then the shortest time between two consecutive taps is 1/12 of a second. These &quot;guide tones&quot; are useful for tuners while counting beats in tempered intervals because tempered intervals make them beat. For example, if you mix 200Hz and 301Hz, then the 3rd harmonic of the lower tone is 600Hz and the 2nd harmonic of the higher tone is 602Hz, which results in 2Hz beating (as long as the overtones are audible, of course). Similarly, if I shaped my mouth in such a way that it had some strong resonance at 600Hz, this resonance would be most audible if I was singing tones like 300Hz, 200Hz, 150Hz, and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Petr,</p><p>I&apos;ll get back to you about epimoric intervals. I&apos;m not omitting the LCM intentionally because I was talking about the GCD. So what you&apos;re driving at is that the LCM frequency is used for tuning? Interesting. So for a simpler example, given 2Hz and 3Hz, their LCM is 6Hz which gives the count required to beat them out. i.e., dividing 1 second into 6 parts, then the 3 bps is on the numbers 1 3 5 while the 2 bps is on 1 and 4. Now some time ago I spoke to Bill about this and he said that studies have shown that our perception of harmonies are not the same as sped up rhythms, so I left it there. But concerning the GCD, everything I said in the last post was intentional.

What you get when doing maths at 4pm after a long gig! Secondly, yes everything you say above checks out exactly from my end too. Just to simplify even further (I&apos;ll choose simplest units possible for reasons that will become clear):</p><p>harmonic series: 2Hz and 3Hz have GCD 1Hz, LCM 6Hz, and in period &quot;lengths&quot; (1/6) seconds is the common &quot;count&quot; while 1 sec is the time it repeats.</p><p>Sub-harmonic series: (1/2)Hz and (1/3)Hz give GCD (1/6)Hz, LCM 1Hz, and the periods give 1 sec as the count and 6 secs as the time it repeats.</p><p>So we see that the GCD of the first series is the LCM of the second and vice-versa, which has historically been a point of confusion. Now, while I knew of its existence, I didn&apos;t know that the LCM could be important for purposes of tuning (only for finding the common count) and am glad to learn otherwise since it widens the playing field. Thanks for that. However, the original debate was that the LCM acts as a type of fundamental of a &quot;subharmonic&quot; series, just as the GCD does for the harmonic series, thereby justifying its existence. My point was that whenever a GCD exists then the result comes from the harmonic series.</p><p>To see this once and for all, let us take a trivial change of units such that 6 seconds becomes &quot;1&quot; in our new units. Then 2 sec must be renamed &quot;1/3&quot;, 3 sec becomes &quot;1/2&quot;, and the frequencies, defined either as inverse period or (equivalently) as number of cycles per our new &quot;unit&quot; time, must be renamed &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot; and &quot;2&quot; respectively. Calculating the GCD of &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; in these new units gives &quot;1&quot; (i.e. original (1/6)Hz) while the LCM is &quot;6&quot; (1Hz in original). Therefore, we see that the &quot;subharmonic series&quot; is purely relative. Unless it appears as an inversion of a given interval then it is still just the harmonic series.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83924 href="#83924">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2009 8:58:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick wrote:</p><p>&gt; the original debate was that the LCM acts as a type of fundamental<br/>&gt; of a &quot;subharmonic&quot; series, just as the GCD does for the harmonic series, thereby justifying<br/>&gt; its existence.

The GCD will ALWAYS represent the fundamental/tonic of a harmonic series and the ONLY condition for it to exist is that the frequencies involved form a ratio. This applies as much to frequencies smaller than 1 as to those larger than 1. For example, take frequencies 1/N and 1/(N+1) where N is whole (i.e. consecutive values from the &quot;Sub-series&quot;). Their ratio is (1/N)/(1/(N+1)) = (N+1)/N and their GCD frequency is (1/N)/(N+1) = (1/(N+1))/N = 1/(N^2 + N). Therefore, both frequencies are now upper harmonics to the tonic-fundamental frequency 1/(N^2 + N). [Or to view it the other way around, 1/(N^2 + N) x (N + 1) = (1/N) and 1/(N^2 + N) x N = 1/(N + 1), so that they are the N&apos;th and (N+1)th upper harmonics of the fundamental 1/(N^2 + N).] IOW, -and this is most important- since the ratio (N+1)/N has both (N+1)&gt;1 and N&gt;1, it follows that they come from the harmonic series; the idea that frequencies smaller than 1 form a unique &quot;subharmonic&quot; series is an illusion. In fact I already proved this in another way with the trivial change of units proof in the last post i.e. by choosing new units the smaller than 1 values became larger than 1.</p><p>All in all, since the sub harmonic series does not exist, then BOTH the GCD and LCM, or &quot;fundamental&quot; and &quot;guide tone&quot;, are characteristic of the harmonic series only and apply whenever two frequencies form a ratio, even for two sine waves. The fact that they are in a sense inverse of one another has nothing to do with the notion that there exists a subharmonic series which is the &quot;inverse&quot; of the true harmonic series. It is intuitive guesswork. I know the maths might be a bit off putting but it is really worth it in the end.

Of course, if 2-second and 3-second periods were tones, then the fundamental would be 6 seconds, not 1.

Similar thing with pedal bass. My only issue is with the term &quot;subharmonic&quot; rather than, say, &quot;inverted&quot; series, mainly because I feel that it only has meaning in relation to harmonic intervals. For eg, C:E has a clear tonic C. Ab:C gives Ab as the tonic. But Ab:C:E together, the maj 3 above and below C, creates ambiguity by setting up two tonics. In numbers we might say 4/5:1:5/4.

I&apos;m only trying to nut out a clearer set of mathematical definitions for the phenomena of sub harmonics. And I now think I understand what you were driving at when you said &quot;just as the GCD is characteristic of the harmonic series, the LCD is characteristic of the subharmonic series&quot;. At any rate, I figured out a good formula which seems to cover it.</p><p>If we take two coprimes larger than 1 then their GCD will be 1 and their LCD will be the product of the two. If we instead take the inverse of these coprimes then the roles of GCD and LCD will be reversed. That is, the LCM will be 1 and the GCD will be the inverse of their product. For simple eg, 3Hz and 5Hz are coprime, GCD = 1 and LCM = 3 x 5 = 15. For (1/3)Hz and (1/5)Hz, GCD = (1/15) and LCM = 1.</p><p>Thus, just as all coprimes have GCD of 1, all inverse coprimes will have LCM of 1. This is why one might say that the LCD is characteristic of the subharmonic series.</p><p>OTOH, if the frequencies are not coprime then other GCD&apos;s and LCD&apos;s will result. Given two non-coprime frequencies p and q with p &gt; q,  if p/q = a/b where a and b are whole, then we obtain the two equations:<br/>1) pb = qa giving the LCM, and<br/>2) p/a = q/b giving the GCD frequency.<br/>Similarly, if our initial frequencies are the inverse values (1/q) and (1/p) (now with (1/q) &gt; (1/p)), then (1/q)/(1/p) = p/q = a/b, and we get the two equations:<br/>3) b/q = a/p for the LCM, and<br/>4) 1/aq = 1/bp giving the GCD frequency.<br/>Again for a simple eg, let p = 9 and q = 6. 9/6 = 3/2, LCM = 18, GCD = 3. Or for inverse frequencies, (1/6)/(1/9) = 3/2, LCM = (1/3) and GCD = (1/18). Again we see this switching going on.</p><p>These four equations will give a simple formula for quickly working out the GCD and LCD for any two frequencies.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83936 href="#83936">ðŸ”—</a>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2009 7:32:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Andreas, I gave it a second look ...

I assume you mean you moved Eb, F# and A from AS&apos;s position, which will obviously change this, and break the &quot;well&quot; temperament pattern, I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Re-cap of AS&apos;s scala file:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; !S_16_17_18_19.scl<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; c# : d : eb : e == 16 : 17 : 18 : 19 == C#1 : D1 : Eb1 : E1<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; !absolute pitches from the middle_c&apos; on:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; !c&apos;243#256 d&apos;272#288 e&apos;304 f&apos;324#342 g&apos;364#384 a&apos;406#432 b&apos;456<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; !<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 256/243 ! ~90.22cent C#(cents) the limma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 272/243 ! ~195.81...

It was my understanding that A.S&apos;s scale was based on successive applications of the fifth as 3/2. I was transposing it taking C as 256 instead of 243 and noticed that the series seems to break down from F# onwards. From B as 486 we have 486 x 3/4 = 364.5 instead of 364. I thought perhaps he just rounded it off except from here we have 364 x 3/2 = 273 instead of 272. Now the fifth from 273 is 409.5 whereas A.S has 406. But even if we take 272 x 3/2 we get 408! I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;m missing, some comma shift I should know about etc?<br/>For the record, A.S&apos;s scale from c&apos;=256 is:<br/>c&apos;256#272 d&apos;288#304 e&apos;324 f&apos;342#364 g&apos;384#406 a&apos;432#456 b&apos;486 c&apos;512.<br/>The 16:17:18:19 is now from the tonic c&apos;.</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83959 href="#83959">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2009 6:39:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When you continue on to say that the LCM frequency &quot;is specific for the subharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; series&quot;, I honestly don&apos;t know what you mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems you haven&apos;t heard about the technique which I call &quot;lower octave singing&quot;. If you&apos;re able to involve not only your regular vocal folds but also your &quot;false vocal folds&quot; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_fold">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_fold</a>), then these will vibrate at half the speed of the proper vocal folds (interestingly, some people with high voices can alternately change this extra tone between 1/2 and 1/3 of the proper vocal fold speed). For example, in this recording, you can hear someone singing a tone close to a Bb1 but his voice is, in fact, tuned to a Bb2. The reason why you hear a Bb1 instead of a Bb2 is that he also uses his false vocal folds together with his proper vocal folds: <a href="http://www.khoomei.com/mp3s/kokarg.mp3">www.khoomei.com/mp3s/kokarg.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Besides, isn&apos;t it true that, say, 3Hz and 5Hz, two notes from the upper harmonic series, also<br/>&gt; &gt; have a LCM of 15Hz?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, they do. And if these would be in the range of our hearing, you might eventually be able to hear this relative frequency of 15 as well, even though only softly. But this effect could get a bit more &quot;pronounced&quot; if you added, for example, another relative frequency of 4/15 to the 3 and 5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Petr,</p><p>I forgot to mention that a friend of mine, Arne Hanna, can sing two notes at once.

Recall that I gave interval p/q = a/b, gcd = p/a = q/b and lcm = pb = qa. If we take the harmonic series of the original two frequencies, p, 2p, 3p...Np and q, 2q, 3q...Np, since the ratio between corresponding harmonics also equals a/b (the N&apos;s cancel), then the same two rules apply and we get a HS for both the gcd and lcm. Eg, 2p/2q = a/b, gcd = 2p/a = 2q/b and lcm = 2pb = 2qa. IOW, instead of thinking of this as the HS of the two freq&apos;s p and q, we can instead look at this as a HS composed of both gcd&apos;s and lcm&apos;s.<br/>Finally, note that the interval between the lcm and gcd is ab: pb/(p/a) = ab.</p><p>Thanks for the post</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83964 href="#83964">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2009 1:49:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick wrote:</p><p>&gt; I forgot to mention that a friend of mine, Arne Hanna, can sing two notes at once.
