For example, there&apos;s the school of thought<br/>that says that it&apos;s okay just deliberately write music in 5-limit JI,<br/>but sort of pretend that it&apos;s the diatonic scale, and just embrace the<br/>comma shifts as having some regular structure that is the hallmark of<br/>JI. OK, well why not do the same thing built around 1L6s instead of<br/>5L2s then? Just go find the periodicity block corresponding to 250/243<br/>and 25/24, and use that as your basis for the overarching scale rather<br/>than 81/80 and 25/24.</p><p>I find particularly appealing as a unifying theme the notion of using<br/>regular temperaments as &quot;adaptive intonation schemes&quot; for coarser<br/>categorical structures.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
