However, McLaren states that there are many more sources that<br/>have not yet been included in the bibliography.</p><p>Here is a &quot;good one&quot; from his statement about the bibliography:</p><p>&quot;This bibliography is grossly incomplete and will probably stretch to<br/>40+ pages in its final version.  Most of the sources cited in the<br/>text are *not* currently listed here.  Work on entering the biblio<br/>text is the lowest form of human activity and a result is ongoing...&quot;</p><p>____________ _________ __________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
