Chet not only is a true<br/>American original, but much hipper than many folks might think,<br/>harmonically and rhythmically. It&apos;s also been said he came up with the<br/>first fuzztone and the first wah pedal...wouldn&apos;t surprise me. Also got<br/>&quot;Roy Buchanan&quot; (his first)...another jaw dropper. Talk about string<br/>bending...and, he&apos;s one of the very few blues guitarists who seems like<br/>he bypassed the usual influences (the 3 Kings, T Bone, etc). I think Roy<br/>was one of the very best in his field, but got a bit overlooked because<br/>he didn&apos;t look too hip (compared to David Lee Roth, etc)...he died in a<br/>jail cell under mysterious circumstances. Another good one is &quot;Then Play<br/>On,&quot; by Fleetwood Mac...I think the English guys, for the most part,<br/>were better off interpreting blues through their own compositions..and<br/>this album has a good, original feel to it. Features Peter Green, who<br/>started off very promising, but toasted his brain somehow, and ruined<br/>his life/career..there&apos;s an interview with him in this month&apos;s Guitar<br/>Player...more later on other good CD&apos;s..Hstick</p></div>
