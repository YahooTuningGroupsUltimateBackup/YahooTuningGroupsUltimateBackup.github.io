But<br/>no, I now believe tetrachordal (not necc. omnitetrachordal) alterations are<br/>always possible, it&apos;s just a question of finding the minimal alteration<br/>that makes it tetrachordal and just how big that alteration turns out to be<br/>in each case.</p><p>It&apos;s not clear to me why a tetrachordal scale in some linear temperament,<br/>must have the same number of notes as a MOS in that temperament, but I&apos;ll<br/>assume it for now. Know any good reason(s)?</p><p>I&apos;d measure the magnitude of a particular alteration (the alteredness?) by<br/>how many notes would have to be added to the original MOS, by consecutive<br/>generators, keeping all chains the same, before you can contain the<br/>tetrachordal scale. e.g. Your tetrachordal decatonic has an alteredness of<br/>2, the minimum possible with a half-octave period.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How do you do them, in general?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a general way, but you understand what<br/>&gt; omnitetrachorality is, right?</p><p>Yes. But I wasn&apos;t considering _omni_tetrachordality. That looks too hard<br/>for now. Do any popular or historical scales have it?</p><p>&gt; &quot;Alteration&quot; simply means re-shuffling<br/>&gt; the step sizes in an MOS or hyper-MOS.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What would be a &quot;tetrachordal alteration&quot; of Blackjack?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t know if there is one! Can you make a blackjack-like scale<br/>&gt; omnitetrachordal?</p><p>God knows!</p><p>But I had previously failed to appreciate that Blackjack (a 21 note chain<br/>of Miracle generators = secors = 116.7c) is tetrachordal. duh! You get<br/>disjunct 9-step tetrachords when you start from the point of symmetry.</p><p>Ok. Lets look at the 10 note Miracle MOS. What&apos;s the minimum alteration to<br/>make it tetrachordal. This just amounts to asking: What is the 10 note<br/>tetrachordal Miracle scale that spans the fewest secors.</p><p>I&apos;ll notate my tetrachords as the conventional C...F and G...C. Since the<br/>tetrachords must share exactly one note (C) and must be melodically<br/>identical, a 10-note tetrachordal scale must have 5 notes in each<br/>tetrachord and 1 note outside the tetrachords. (The possibility of 3 notes<br/>outside the tetrachord can be ignored because even Blackjack has only 2 and<br/>we expect to get out of it with fewer generators than Blackjack).</p><p>Here&apos;s what we start with</p><p>             5                   1<br/>C&gt; D[ Eb&lt; Ev F  Gb^ G&gt; A[ Bb&lt; Bv C  Db^ D&gt; E[ F&lt; F#v G  Ab^ A&gt; B[ C&lt;<br/>                                 5                   1</p><p>That&apos;s a long enough chain of secors (Blackjack) where we will number the<br/>notes of each tetrachord of our 10-note scale in pitch order. One<br/>tetrachord above and one below. We&apos;ll then mark the note that&apos;s outside the<br/>tetrachords with an &quot;X&quot;. We&apos;ll try to stay as close to the center of the<br/>chain as possible.</p><p>Note that X can go on either Gb^ or F#v. So here are eight minimal<br/>possibilities.
