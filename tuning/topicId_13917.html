For example, while a<br/>crude experiment in Pythagorean persuaded me that an interval of<br/>around 678 cents (the diminished sixth or &quot;Wolf fifth,&quot; e.g. G#-Eb)<br/>could indeed sound like a recognizable and acceptable fifth in a<br/>vibraphone-like timbre, I was really excited when I confirmed that in<br/>23-tet, 13/23 octave could actually likewise serve as a stable fifth<br/>in practice as well as theory.</p><p>Improvising or composing in a new tuning is for me often a process of<br/>moving from the known to the unknown. The familiar Gothic sonorities<br/>and cadences (for a neo-Gothic tuning), or Renaissance progressions<br/>(for a tuning like a 24-note archicembalo in 1/4-comma meantone),<br/>provide a point of ready orientation. From here, I can branch out into<br/>altered intervals, direct chromaticism or shifts of a comma or diesis,<br/>and so forth.</p><p>In what follows, I&apos;ll try to address some of these questions in more<br/>detail, maybe focusing especially on my &quot;24-out-of-N&quot; paradigm I tend<br/>to apply to theoretically open as well as closed tunings: Pythagorean,<br/>1/4-comma meantone, 29-tET, and Keenan Pepper&apos;s beautiful new<br/>neo-Gothic temperament based on Phi, for example.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Context: A prologue in three short illustrations<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>As a prologue to what follows, I would start with a word that may not<br/>be so surprising: _context_. How one approaches a scale may vary<br/>radically with how one approaches intervals, modes, and progressions.<br/>People who come from backgrounds other than medieval and Renaissance<br/>European music shouldn&apos;t be surprised if some of my own views and<br/>&quot;natural&quot; ways of approaching certain tunings seem quite strange.</p><p>For example, your recent mention of 53-tET reminded me of how people<br/>can view a tuning through different musical lenses and make different<br/>assumptions about its basic intervals, let alone the fine points of<br/>stylistic applications.</p><p>One of my favorite &quot;litmus tests&quot; might be to ask people: &quot;How many<br/>steps does a diatonic semitone have in 53-tET?&quot;</p><p>From my medievalist perspective, the answer is 4 steps, and we have a<br/>regular tuning almost identical to 3-limit or Pythagorean JI, e.g.</p><p>   9     9     9   4    9     9   4<br/>F     G     A     B  C     D     E  F</p><p>For someone oriented mainly to a 5-limit or higher standard of<br/>stability, however, 53-tET just as &quot;naturally&quot; suggests an<br/>approximation of Ptolemy&apos;s or Zarlino&apos;s syntonic diatonic with its<br/>unequal whole-tones of either 8 or 9 steps, and large diatonic<br/>semitones of 5 steps.</p><p>Two other amusing illustrations of &quot;context&quot; involve the way that a<br/>major third in a given tuning can mean quite different things to<br/>different people.</p><p>When I read James Barbour&apos;s comments that when all things are said and<br/>done, the thirds of 29-tET are still not very good, I want to reply:<br/>&quot;What do you mean: the major third of 29-tET is around 413.7 cents,<br/>quite close to a usual Pythagorean 81:64, but just enough larger to<br/>make a bit of a musical distinction?&quot; The humor, of course, is that<br/>Barbour is very likely referring to what I would term diminished<br/>fourths, or &quot;alternative thirds,&quot; vis-a-vis 5:4. Then, again, he was<br/>hardly evaluating these tunings in terms of Gothic or neo-Gothic<br/>aesthetics &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Similarly, when Paul Erlich recently talked about &quot;stretching&quot; the<br/>major thirds of 22-tET, my first reaction was, &quot;At 436.36 cents, do<br/>they really need &apos;stretching&apos; -- they&apos;re already a tad larger than<br/>your beloved &apos;mininum entropy&apos; valley at 9:7.&quot; Of course, Paul was<br/>doubtless referring to the alternative or &quot;schisma&quot; third of 7 steps,<br/>a bit smaller than 5:4. I was reflecting on the &quot;regular&quot; (to me)<br/>major third of 8 steps, a rather stretched 81:64 which can have a very<br/>pleasant effect when it expands to a fifth.</p><p>Enough of contextual musings, the main point being that how one<br/>approaches and explores a tuning may depend on what musical<br/>&quot;questions&quot; one is asking at the outset -- not that experience can&apos;t<br/>broaden these questions or raise new ones.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>2. A personal tuning pattern: from-12-to-24-out-of-N<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>In explaining my approach to how-many-out-of-N questions, I might<br/>begin by noting that for historical medieval and Renaissance music I<br/>play, and for more or less &quot;conventional&quot; improvisations in similar<br/>styles, a 12-note range of Eb-G# or the like is typically ample. Thus<br/>12-out-of-N with two conventional MIDI keyboards tuned in unison can<br/>seem like a natural rather than constrained solution.</p><p>However, I also tune 13-to-24-out-of-N either to emulate late medieval<br/>or Renaissance/Manneristic schemes such as the proposed 17-note<br/>Pythagorean keyboards of the early 15th century or a 24-note subset of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 31-note meantone cycle for the archicembalo; or to devise<br/>schemes of this kind for compositions or improvisations in derivative<br/>styles.</p><p>Although I&apos;m trying to come up with some scheme of &quot;circulating&quot;<br/>14th-century-style cadences for 17-tET (easier done on paper than<br/>mastered fluently at the keyboard), this is almost like a solution in<br/>search of a problem. Circulating around a complete tuning circle isn&apos;t<br/>generally a part of the medieval/Renaissance/Manneristic tradition,<br/>and so is something of a novelty to me. There are a few pieces from<br/>the 16th and early 17th centuries which fall into this kind of<br/>category, including Colonna&apos;s &quot;example of circulation&quot; moving through<br/>all 31 steps on his instrument, but these are rather like the<br/>exception which underscores the rule.</p><p>Thus my main reason for using an n-tET is not necessarily that it<br/>circulates, but mainly that it represents an interesting shade of<br/>temperament (e.g. 29-tET for neo-Gothic music) or an attractively<br/>&quot;different&quot; setting (e.g. 23-tET &quot;Sethareanized&quot; with a metallophone<br/>timbre for neo-Gothic purposes).</p><p>Note, by the way, that various theoretically open tunings lend<br/>themselves to &quot;virtual&quot; or musical closure in a certain number of<br/>notes: for example a 53-note cycle in Pythagorean, or a 31-note cycle<br/>in 1/4-comma meantone. Here, as with an n-tET, someone regarding<br/>circulation as a usual musical feature rather than a &quot;special effect&quot;<br/>would have a strong incentive to tune a full cycle.</p><p>However, circularity aside, there are two powerful motivations for<br/>tuning more than 12 notes per octave, motivations applying both to<br/>experimental late medieval and Renaissance composers, and to<br/>derivative styles:</p><p>       (1) Having standard sonorities and cadences available on<br/>           more steps of the gamut; and</p><p>       (2) Having available new kinds of vertical and melodic<br/>           intervals and progressions.</p><p>To illustrate the first point, let&apos;s consider what happens when we<br/>take a 12-note Pythagorean or neo-Gothic tuning with a range of Eb-G#<br/>and add a 13th note Ab. Now we have available, for example, two new<br/>cadences of the following typical variety. Here C4 is middle C:</p><p>Eb4 F4 G4        G4   Ab3<br/>C4     D4        D4   Eb3<br/>Ab3    G3        Bb3  Ab3</p><p>In the first example, Ab serves to permit a new kind of regular<br/>cadence with a descending diatonic semitone to G (Ab-G). In the second<br/>example, maybe more radically, Ab itself serves as a new stable goal<br/>for a cadence. In our expanded 13-note system, the unstable sonority<br/>Bb3-D4-G4 now has _two_ possible regular resolutions where a major<br/>third expands to a fifth and a major sixth to an octave, the familiar<br/>one to A by descending semitonal motion or the new one to Ab by<br/>ascending semitonal motion:</p><p>G4  A4      G4  Ab3<br/>D4  E4      D4  Eb3<br/>Bb3 A3  or  Bb3 Ab3</p><p>The second enticement to larger tunings, the availability of new kinds<br/>of intervals both for vertical sonorities and for melodic<br/>progressions, may be even more compelling from a xenharmonic<br/>viewpoint.</p><p>For example, I love 29-tET, and enjoy 24-out-of-29 because it makes<br/>available those striking major thirds at 11/29 octave or ~455.17<br/>cents, a diesis wider than the usual 10/29 octave (~413.79 cents),<br/>which can expand to a fifth with a characteristic melodic motion of<br/>only a diesis or 1/5-tone (~41.38 cents) in one of the voices.</p><p>Why not _always_ tune 24-out-of-N, rather than any smaller number, for<br/>tunings where precise or virtual closure involves 24 or more notes?</p><p>My main answer might be that when using the two keyboards as manuals<br/>with contrasting timbres, having all or most of the keys in unison can<br/>make things simpler. With tuning sets of 13-16 notes, the moderate<br/>complications can be charming, but for 17-24 notes, treating both<br/>manuals as part of a monotimbral &quot;archicembalo&quot; is generally more<br/>straightforward.</p><p>Incidentally, my choice of 24 notes as a &quot;large&quot; tuning size mainly<br/>reflects the logistics of performing polyphonic music live on two<br/>12-note keyboards with conveniently repeating octaves on each<br/>manual. The TX-802 itself supports any arbitrary mapping of notes to<br/>keys. Since many compositions or improvisations in medieval or related<br/>styles can easily fit in a two-octave range, for example, a 48-note<br/>tuning mapping 24 notes per octave to each 49-note keyboard would be<br/>quite technically possible. My main question might be: &quot;How do I play<br/>fifths with a single hand, let alone octaves?&quot;</p><p>Of course, it remains true that each note brings new possibilities,<br/>and that 24 is only one possible number in a cycle such as 29-tET,<br/>Pythagorean 53, or a 121-note circulating version of Keenan Pepper&apos;s<br/>tuning.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. A &quot;parallel keyboard&quot; paradigm: 12-times-2-out-of-N<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>When tuning 24-out-of-N, I have a leaning more specifically to a<br/>&quot;generalized&quot; (or maybe better &quot;parallel&quot;) scheme in which the two<br/>12-note keyboards have identical interval arrangements at the distance<br/>of a comma, diesis, or n-tET scale step apart.</p><p>In a 24-note Pythagorean or &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; scheme, this distance is<br/>equal to the Pythagorean comma of 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents). For a<br/>24-note subset of Vicentino&apos;s or Colonna&apos;s 31-note cycle in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, it is likewise equal to a diesis (e.g. G#-Ab) of 128:125, or<br/>~41.06 cents.</p><p>For 29-tET, a neo-Gothic tuning with qualities quite different than<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 16th-century meantone, the distance between manuals is<br/>interestingly an almost identical diesis (here 1/29-octave or<br/>1/5-tone) of ~41.38 cents.</p><p>For Keenan Pepper&apos;s regular tuning where the ratio of the chromatic to<br/>the diatonic semitone is equal to Phi, with fifths of ~704.096 cents,<br/>the distance is again equal to the comma or diesis between Ab and G#,<br/>here ~49.15 cents.</p><p>This kind of &quot;12-times-2-out-of-N&quot; arrangement might be described as a<br/>&quot;two parallel universes&quot; approach to composition or improvisation.</p><p>Each keyboard, in itself, offers a complete and familiar 12-note<br/>tuning. Additionally, the two &quot;universes&quot; combined offer two enhanced<br/>dimensions of musical creativity:</p><p>         (1) Progressions which make the &quot;jump&quot; or &quot;quantum leap&quot;<br/>             between the two parallel keyboards; and</p><p>         (2) Sonorities combining notes from both keyboards, either<br/>             making intervals already present within a 12-note tuning<br/>             available at more locations, or generating new kinds<br/>             of intervals.</p><p>Both dimensions manifest themselves, for example, in the small sample<br/>of &quot;enharmonic&quot; or fifthtone music we have from Nicola Vicentino<br/>(1555). Stunning diesis shifts in cadential or other progressions,<br/>and novel intervals such as the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; which<br/>Vicentino describes as having a ratio of approximately 11:9, beckon us<br/>to a new realm of musical creativity.</p><p>Similarly, a &quot;two parallel universes&quot; arrangement for a neo-Gothic<br/>tuning such as 29-tET makes available both progressions from one<br/>12-note keyboard to another (involving melodic intervals altered by<br/>a diesis or 1/5-tone), and new intervals such as the extra-wide<br/>cadential major third of 11/29-octave (with a ratio of ~13:10)<br/>inviting resolution to a fifth.</p><p>In contrast to a model of circulation based on a closed (or virtually<br/>closed) tuning cycle, this &quot;parallel universes&quot; model may lend itself<br/>to forms of musical motion, and possibly systematic &quot;perambulation&quot;<br/>involving leaps between the two 12-note gamuts.</p><p>----------------------<br/>4. Concluding comments<br/>----------------------</p><p>Note that all of the above discussion assumes a compositional or<br/>improvisational &quot;paradigm&quot; that one brings to a new tuning. However,<br/>it is also quite possible to take the tuning itself as a starting<br/>point, and ask, &quot;What kind of patterns can I discover in these<br/>intervals that might lead to some interesting compositions or<br/>improvisations?&quot;</p><p>There may be a kind of middle ground: &quot;I&apos;m choosing this tuning<br/>because it permits me to use &apos;recognizable&apos; patterns of a style with<br/>which I&apos;m familiar, but introduces complications or ambiguities.&quot;</p><p>Various ways of analyzing tunings, including mine, are based on<br/>musical categories or assumptions which may apply to some styles but<br/>not to others.</p><p>For Paul Erlich, for example, one important consideration may be<br/>&quot;consistency&quot; for an n-tET at various limits.</p><p>In a neo-Gothic setting, I might consider the &quot;symmetry&quot; or<br/>&quot;asymmetry&quot; of a tuning for a few important intervals: for example,<br/>does the best approximation of a 4:3 fourth plus the best<br/>approximation of a 9:8 major second add up to the best approximation<br/>of a 3:2 fifth. If not, the tuning is &quot;asymmetrical&quot; -- an intriguing<br/>feature, as with 23-tET.</p><p>One point which Ivor Darreg and Brian McLaren have made bears special<br/>emphasis: each n-tET has its own &quot;flavor&quot; -- an observation applying<br/>to other kinds of tunings also -- and, I might add, different<br/>&quot;flavors&quot; to different people depending on their backgrounds and<br/>expectations.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
