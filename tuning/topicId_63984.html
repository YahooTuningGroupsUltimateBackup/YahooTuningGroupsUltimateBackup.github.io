It reminds<br/>me of an event that happened when I was in the last year of my conservatory<br/>studies. One day, I met a student who was in the first year at that time.<br/>And I clearly remember him having said that the C minor chord was the one<br/>made of the tones &quot;C-D#-G&quot;. When he said this, I imagined a chord similar to<br/>6:7:9 or something like that and I thought: &quot;I&apos;d wish him to hear how this<br/>sounds.&quot;</p><p>&gt; I even remember this rule always to use sharps when ascending and flats<br/>when<br/>&gt; descending...</p><p>As late as after doing a few experiments with this in 5-limit JI and later<br/>in meantone, I finally understood this was partly a result of an idea of a<br/>possible melodic or harmonic phrase where the tones with accidentals are the<br/>ones to be resolved (i.e. the leading tones) and the naturals are the ones<br/>to which the resolution leads (i.e. the results of common melodic or<br/>harmonic cadences). If it was the opposite, then surely you&apos;d have to use<br/>sharps when descending and flats when ascending.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2006 7:41:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;If kids in theory classes are not being taught that C# and Db arenot<br/>&gt;necessarily the same in a meantone context the curriculum needs to be<br/>&gt;changed.<br/>Correct, because in 19tone keyboard-instruments, like on:<br/><a href="http://www.denzilwraight.com/roman.htm">http://www.denzilwraight.com/roman.htm</a><br/>are B#=Cb and E#=Fb equal same instead C#=Db, as in 12et.</p><p>Here are my frequencies absolute in Hertzians for that harpsichord<br/>as tuning instruction in the circle of 19 times 5ths like i did in:<br/><a href="http://www.strukturbildung.de/Andreas.Sparschuh/">http://www.strukturbildung.de/Andreas.Sparschuh/</a><br/>(sorry! available only in german at the moment)</p><p>A 55,110,220,440 Hz &lt;=start with tuning-fork A4 pitch<br/>E 165:=55*3 begin with an just pure 5th: A&gt;E<br/>B 247,494(495:=165*3) flatten 5th E4&gt;B4 down one single Hz flat<br/>F# 185,370,740(741:=247*3) flatten 5th  B4&gt;F#5 also down 1 Hz flat<br/>C# 69,138,276,553(555=185*3)F#4&gt;C#5 too, 3rd A&gt;C# 275:=55*5 1Hz sharp<br/>G# 103,206(207) &amp;ct.<br/>D# 77,154,308(309) attend the septimal-tritonus A&gt;D# ratio: 7/5<br/>A# 321:=77*3=33*7 pure,in order to yield an harmonic 7th to F1:=33 Hz<br/>E#=Fb 43,86,172,344,688(693) meantonic 19-tone enharmonics E#=Fb<br/>B#=Cb 64,128(129:=43*3)located on the keyboard inbetween keys B and C<br/>Gb (95,190)191(192:=64*3) now b-flats accidentials instead #-sharps<br/>Db 71,142,284(285:=95*3) 4th Db4&gt;Gb4 beats 1 Hz sharp<br/>Ab 53,106,212(213:=71*3)<br/>Eb 79,158(159:=53*3)<br/>Bb 59,118,236(237:=79*3)<br/>F 11,22,44,88,176(177) wanting F:C:A:D#:G == 1:3:5:7:9 partial series<br/>C 33 also C:E:G:A# septimal C major 4-chord C:E:G:A#==1:3:5:7<br/>G 99 do you really like an pure 11:33:55:77:99 sounding just 5-chord?<br/>D 37,74,148,296(297) SC=81/80=(297/296)*(111/110) two subdivions<br/>A 55,110(111) cycle of 19 tones complete ready closed on A1=55Hz</p><p>&gt; I remember being taught that they were just different names for the<br/>&gt; same note, and the enharmonic spelling wasn&apos;t important.<br/>here an other enharmonic identity than Db=C# is valid:</p><p>  B#1=Cb2:=64Hz &amp; E#1=Fb1:=43 Hz</p><p>have equally the same pitch-frequencies by defintion.<br/>Attend:<br/>~41 Hz is about the lowest E1 string on a electric or double-bass.<br/><a href="http://www.41hz.com/">http://www.41hz.com/</a><br/>but E1 becomes here in above tuning concrete an quarter Hertzian<br/>sharper that that:<br/>E1=41.25Hz ,82.5Hz ,165Hz:=E3</p><p>&gt; I even<br/>&gt; remember this rule always to use sharps when ascending and flats<br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; descending...<br/>You can forget that here, because:<br/>C#2=69 Hz and Db2=71 Hz are appearently different,<br/>even well audiable distinguishing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would also help a lot if keyboards with split<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; black keys were more popular.<br/>Even the 19 tone Denzils W. harpsichords too?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Better yet, two ranks of white keys, suitable for either extended<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone or 19-edo.<br/>logarithmic 19et has only good minor 3rds, because<br/>(6 / 5)^19 = ~ 31.948...=~ 32=2^5 , 5 times an 8th=octave.<br/>but has only an bad approximation for the harmonic 7th with ratio 7/4,<br/>barely 19 minor 3rds sound simply to much sad for my ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm, interesting.
