To borrow from one thread, at least, this discussion might<br/>involve a bit of Pythagorean &quot;two-gear biking&quot; assuming neither<br/>circularity nor lots of _small_ integer ratios.</p><p>Reading your posts with great interest, one question has captured my<br/>imagination over the last couple of days: how might my approach to<br/>tuning and notation be made more understandable to a composer and<br/>musician with your kind of lively historical interest, so that people<br/>can feel free to borrow or adapt what might seem helpful and may take<br/>it as a starting point for some radical new direction?</p><p>Your mention of Nicola Vicentino might be especially relevant here<br/>because Vicentino introduced a basic notational tool -- the use of a<br/>dot above a note -- which together with the five-line staff and the<br/>conventional accidentals Eb-G# makes it possible for me to notate any<br/>of my &quot;usual&quot; 24-note tunings. (A 17-note Pythagorean tuning or<br/>complete 17-tET circle calls for Gb-A# without dots getting involved.)</p><p>I wonder how my approach might look from your perspective as someone<br/>evidently most familiar with 12-tET -- indeed a common _conceptual_<br/>element in the training of many musicians, whatever may be the<br/>realities of psychoacoustical perception or flexible-pitch intonation.</p><p>Please let me reassure you that my purpose here is not to persuade you<br/>to take up a neo-Gothic style, but just to toss out some ideas which<br/>might have a certain entertainment value, and possibly could suggest<br/>some ideas for your own creative dilemmas in following your own<br/>musical and intonational style on a fixed-pitch keyboard.</p><p>Of course, I must also emphasize that you would be bestowing me with a<br/>great benefit in such a dialogue: feedback which at once might help me<br/>to articulate my ideas more clearly, and give me some insights into<br/>how other musicians look at things.</p><p>For now, I would say that _two_ 12-note keyboards seem a very pleasant<br/>arrangement for me, with a typical 24-note notation which really needs<br/>to indicate only two &quot;variables&quot; or &quot;parameters,&quot; so to speak:</p><p>           (1) Which note is it (Eb-G#)?<br/>           (2) Which of the two keyboards is it on (lower/upper)?</p><p>Of course, this is a much simpler problem than either the 72-tET<br/>situation or the n-limit JI situation: we&apos;re dealing here primarily<br/>with regular tunings having fifths ranging from Pythagorean to<br/>17-tET.</p><p>Interestingly, the same principles can nicely apply to what I&apos;d call<br/>two historical 20th-century tunings when used for a neo-Gothic kind of<br/>style: 24-tET, and 24-of-36-tET (yes, the regular thirds and sixths<br/>are a bit subdued, but there&apos;s room for some variation and diversity<br/>here).</p><p>Anyway, thank you and others for a most fascinating thread which has<br/>lent energy both to my own musicmaking, and to the project of trying<br/>to explain some notational aspects here, however partially and<br/>imperfectly.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/28/2001 9:48:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

You had mentioned these two<br/>Pythagorean keyboards before, and I knew that they differed from one<br/>another by a Pythagorean comma, but I never knew precisely how you<br/>used your notation.</p><p>Why of course, this seems like a VERY simple and straightforward<br/>method of notating!
