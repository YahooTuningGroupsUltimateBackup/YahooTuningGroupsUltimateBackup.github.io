Can anyone confirm<br/>&gt; or deny?</p><p>This is neither confirmation nor denial, but observation.<br/>It makes sense to me that the 7/4 would seem to<br/>go sharp and approximate the 9/5.  This seems to be<br/>a confirmation of the &quot;tonalness&quot; idea.</p><p>Both chords are implying the same fundamental, 8/5.<br/>But the one with 9/5 has proportions (for the total<br/>chord) that are *half* those of the chord with 7/4:</p><p>   [8/5] 1/1  5/4  3/2  9/5<br/>    [8:] 10 : 12 : 15 : 18<br/> = [16:] 20 : 24 : 30 : 36</p><p>   [8/5] 1/1  5/4  3/2  7/4<br/>   [16:] 20 : 24 : 30 : 35</p><p>I think the fact that the 9/5 makes a chord with such<br/>smaller proportions, causes a tendency for us (or at<br/>least for you in this experiment) to perceive<br/>the &quot;tonalness&quot; in the 7/4 chord as the simpler model<br/>of 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5.</p><p>Added weight is given to this explanation by the<br/>fact that you tested dyads separately and did not<br/>find evidence of this perceptual sharpening there.</p><p>It would come about only as a result of the stronger<br/>implication of a fundamental, in chords of 3 or more<br/>tones.  Dyads are much more ambiguous in their<br/>tonal implications.</p><p>- Monzo<br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=2023 href="#2023">ðŸ”—</a>David Mezquita &#x3C;DMEZQUI@xxxxxxxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/1999 5:20:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph L Monzo wrote:</p><p>&gt;   [8/5] 1/1  5/4  3/2  9/5<br/>&gt;    [8:] 10 : 12 : 15 : 18<br/>&gt; = [16:] 20 : 24 : 30 : 36<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   [8/5] 1/1  5/4  3/2  7/4<br/>&gt;   [16:] 20 : 24 : 30 : 35</p><p>Excuse me, is&apos;nt it...</p><p>    [8/5] 1/1  5/4  3/2  9/5<br/>    [16:] 20 : 25 : 30 : 36</p><p>    [8/5] 1/1  5/4  3/2  7/4<br/>    [16:] 20 : 25 : 30 : 35</p><p>David Mezquita.</p></div><h3><a id=2027 href="#2027">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/23/1999 10:38:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>your post would have been easier to follow (for me at least) if you had<br/>used some convention like: fractions x/y for names of single notes, and<br/>ratios x:y, x:y:z for dyads, triads etc. Of course in the case of triads<br/>and higher, one can have ratios between fractions like a/b : c/d : e/f.

But shouldn&apos;t the second chord sound just as much like a mistuning<br/>of 16:20:24:30:34 (8:10:12:15:17)? In this case the high note is flatter. I<br/>tried that too (with a piano tone), and I&apos;m willing to grant that maybe the<br/>:35 sounds more like the :36 than the :34. But it&apos;s subtle. They mostly<br/>just sound like 3 different chords to me, all fairly dissonant.</p><p>Certainly we could explain the preference for :36 by stepping down from<br/>looking at the numbers in the whole chord to looking at the subchords and<br/>intervals in lowest terms. There are many more small-numbered subsets in<br/>the :36 chord than in the :34 chord.</p><p>These chords (:34, :35, :36) have Euler&apos;s Gradus Suavitatus (EGS) of 26,<br/>17, 12 respectively. EGS does, in a sense, consider the subchords since it<br/>takes the LCM. A reminder: EGS is: Find LCM/GCD, find its prime factors,<br/>add up all the factors, subtract the number of factors, add one.</p><p>[A long time ago Paul Erlich wrote:]<br/>The diminished seventh chord is tuned 10:12:14:17, and the dominant<br/>flat-9 is tuned 8:10:12:14:17, when performed by a barbershop quartet or<br/>other free-pitched ensemble.</p><p>Note the 14 in place of the 15 we&apos;ve been considering. Don&apos;t know what this<br/>means. Just thought I&apos;d mention it. These have EGS&apos;s of 31 and 32<br/>respectively.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div>
