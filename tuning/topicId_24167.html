You get 3125<br/>instructions per second, a pitch bend is 3 instructions.</p><p>But this is only on transmitting.  All the soundcards I&apos;ve tested (not a<br/>statistically significant sample :) respond to all bits, but then truncate<br/>it to their internal resolution (usually around a cent).</p><p>One Ensoniq I heard seemed to be interpolating to give smooth pitch bends,<br/>which unfortunately sounded a real mess for pitch bend tuning.</p><p>Note also that internal MIDI streams in a PC don&apos;t have the speed<br/>restrictions mentioned above.  Check the MIDI Yoke documentation on<br/>feedback.  This can be a problem in other ways.  I found that MIDI Relay<br/>sent (N)RPN messages so fast they arrived out of order in the sequencer,<br/>so I had to slow them down (or maybe I forgot ;).</p><p>Modern keyboards have a &quot;to host&quot; cable that can plug straight into the<br/>PC.  I don&apos;t know whether or not this observes the old MIDI bit rate.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3><a id=24224 href="#24224">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 12:52:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 6/1/01 5:00 AM, &quot;<a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:graham@microtonal.co.uk">graham@microtonal.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s worse than that.
