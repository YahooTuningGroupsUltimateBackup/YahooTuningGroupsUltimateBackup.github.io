I have seen no evidence in any psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; model of consonance, whether based on roughness, harmonic entropy, or<br/>&gt; combination tones, to suggest that ratios of higher powers of low primes<br/>&gt; could be more consonant that ratios of lower numbers based on higher primes.<br/>&gt; Certainly one will find the former in many chords built mainly of consonant<br/>&gt; intervals, but if you compare the intervals themselves, and really try to<br/>&gt; listen for &quot;objective&quot; dissonance, I think you&apos;ll find that I&apos;m right.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I won&apos;t say I know enough at this point. In the situation we were<br/>discussing, with chords and scales, I was referring to something that<br/>has come up lately in a few threads, that of the ratios between ALL the<br/>simultaneous terms.</p><p>27/16 in isolation may well be perceived as a sharp 5/3. In the<br/>context of<br/>        C   D   G<br/>       1/1 9/8 3/2</p><p>I think the &quot;fifth of the fifth of the fifth&quot; will be perceived<br/>rather than a mistuned 5/3 (mistuned to become more harmonious!).</p><p>My guess is that sounding 27/16 with</p><p>        C    D   G<br/>       1/1 10/9 3/2</p><p>the 10/9 will be perceived as the &apos;wrong&apos; note.</p><p>Similarly in</p><p>        C    D   G    A<br/>       1/1  9/8 3/2  5/3</p><p>I think the 5/3 will be perceived as flat.</p><p>Perhaps these are contrived examples (and I&apos;ll have to give them a<br/>listen), or perhaps you can just add up all the lower limit intervals<br/>and say &quot;well 10/9 fails &apos;cuz it lunches the 4/3&quot;. What I believe they<br/>show is my belief that the strong pocket at 3/2 (shown in your graphs)<br/>can (somehow) carry over into a strong pocket on the &quot;3/2 of 3/2&quot;. Not<br/>too new a batch of knowledge, I&apos;ve discovered Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>The other point is that in all these cases, what I believe will be<br/>the perceived as &quot;correct note&quot; is also the &quot;overtone series note&quot;.<br/>This may or may not be important. I was surprised in playing with<br/>the altered dominant scales that there was a &apos;rightness&apos; in having<br/>the b9 and #9 represented as 17 and 19 where I would have wanted<br/>6/5 or 7/6 for the #9 to tune with a 9/5 or 7/4 seventh.</p><p>thanks.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
