I know that it&apos;s more often used as a 7-limit<br/>temperament, but I am really digging the 2.3.5.17.19 subgroup<br/>interpretation is what really makes it shine. Specifically, look at<br/>the following pentachord (in 12-tet)</p><p>C C# D E F</p><p>If you can&apos;t hear that C# as anything except for an implied major<br/>third below the fourth, just play the (maybe 15:)16:17:18:20 chunk of<br/>the harmonic series on the piano until it snaps in. The fourth should<br/>be a break away from that and not sound like 16/21 - the point is that<br/>we&apos;re taking this 8:9:10 that is C-D-E and splitting the C-D into<br/>16:17:18.</p><p>Once you start hearing it as some kind of &quot;Major&quot; extension above the<br/>root, you have it locked in. So play that tetrachord - C C# D E F -<br/>and then create a disjunct tetrachord over G - G G# A B C. Play this<br/>whole scale over and over. If you&apos;re anything like me you&apos;re tripping<br/>out. If you aren&apos;t tripping out I might post some improvisations to<br/>demonstrate the concept. AGAIN - focus on the perception of C# as<br/>being a &quot;rooted&quot; interval over C, and focus on G# as being a &quot;rooted&quot;<br/>interval over G. DO NOT think of the G# as a b6 over C - yet.</p><p>Anyway, what we have above is now C C# D E F G G# A B C. This is a<br/>proper MODMOS of augmented[9]. Again, play this scale again until you<br/>get the gist of what&apos;s going on: we have this 17-limit otonal<br/>structure over C, and another one over G. In 12-equal, we are done -<br/>we now have the harmonic structure we want. However, in other tuning<br/>systems, like 21-equal, we&apos;re not done, because this resulting scale<br/>has some strange properties - since 81/80 doesn&apos;t vanish, the<br/>difference between F and G is now 10/9, not 9/8 as we probably want.</p><p>This can be accomplished by the addition of one more note - F# - to<br/>the scale, which leads to</p><p>C C# D E F F# G G# A B C</p><p>This leads to two ridiculously awesome results!</p><p>1) The scale is now made up of three tetrachords - C-C#-D-E, F-F#-G-A,<br/>and G-G#-A-B, all of which fit into your newly acquired perception of<br/>16:17:18:20<br/>2) This scale is now one of the Pajara pentachordal scales, and as<br/>such it works in 22-equal.</p><p>I can&apos;t stop playing this, it&apos;s blowing my mind. I feel like I&apos;ve<br/>discovered new sounds in 12-equal. Has anyone played with this before?<br/>Maybe some &quot;microtonal&quot; 12-tet improvs would better demonstrate the<br/>concept if nobody gets it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2011 3:19:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Maybe some &quot;microtonal&quot; 12-tet improvs would better demonstrate<br/>&gt; the concept if nobody gets it.</p><p>I&apos;ve always thought there&apos;s still room for innovation in<br/>dimipent in 12-ET.  I&apos;d love to hear your subgroup pajara<br/>-inspired results!  -Carl</p></div>
