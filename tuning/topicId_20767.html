I have,<br/>&gt;by now, contacted six universities.  I feel that, apparently, they do<br/>&gt;not think microtonality/tuning and temperament is of any importance<br/>&gt;to students.</p><p>I believe at one time there was a class at Cal Poly called acoustic communication where alternate tuning was glanced (it was cancelled due to students not grasping the material). There might be at most one other class besides avante garde performance. The Cal Poly music department falls firmly in on the liberal arts side where you either pick paths with classical or jazz performance.</p><p>I unfortunately have little hope for accomplishing much at Cal Poly. They have a fully loaded Kyma system that I really want to get access to, but I was denied to take the synthesis course (though I have personally studied the subject and have much more experience than other students; I&apos;ve talked to a lot of the students that take the sound design courses). Apparently instead of taking a true academic approach to synthesis the professor is putting on a big theatrical performance 6 weeks into the quarter using all the students from the &quot;synthesis&quot; course. The students will have a minimum of individual control with this performance. In fact he is making them pay a $100 course fee which is going to fund his performance. I consider a fee above tuition for something that is not directly beneficial to the students to be a little too much. I was denied participation because I was not a former student of his, but became rather flustered when he would not even listen to my work or consider me for the class. That is ok though as it is obviously not what I am interested in being involved with anyway.</p><p>&gt;When we study the messages on the Tuning group (20756<br/>&gt;at the time of my writing this), we get some idea about the depth and<br/>&gt;breadth, the nature and pre-requisites of the study material, even to<br/>&gt;thoroughly follow those postings.  There is NO course available<br/>&gt;anywhere, suitable for entry to the pre-requisites to the kind and<br/>&gt;level of this group.</p><p>Yes, that is why I am fascinated by the content even though my comprehension still has some catching up! My musical world (breadth understanding) has exploded in the last year and I am getting my hands into everything. I have been most successful in learning the recording process and the more logical side of the tools I have acquired (helps having the programming background)! Theory is my weak link, but I have time on my side!</p><p>&gt;I would have gladly opted for the degree course in Western music, but I &gt;see that it will not help me for my specific requirements.  I do not even &gt;know what those requirements are!</p><p>I&apos;m glad I stayed with a technical degree, but that has been very limiting as well. I am mostly self taught with programming too. As far as requirements. That is a good question! I am really working hard on getting the recording process (recording/mixing/mastering) down, so I can achieve some level of quality from my home studio. You could be the greatest musician and know the most theory, but if you can&apos;t make a decent recording what is the point of it all!</p><p>&gt;But for encouraging postings from members like Jacky and Margo; but for &gt;the interest that the members have shown in Indian music; but for the hope &gt;that, sooner or later, somebody will show the way, I would have considered &gt;putting my membership on hold.</p><p>Yes, I hope I can also demonstrate how the music I am working with has great applications to microtonality coming from someone who knows very little about the subject. I have several DJ mix sets (the march 7th live set or Divide and Conquer would be the ones to check out) online at my site (<a href="http://www.egregious.net/comps/">http://www.egregious.net/comps/</a>) and I put up too small clips of recent tinkering in the studio (<a href="http://www.egregious.net/~catharsis/tracks/">http://www.egregious.net/~catharsis/tracks/</a>). These clips are not finished songs and not necessarily microtonal on intent, but will give some insight on where I am coming from with a fusion of guitar and electronics. I have found free hosting on a T1 and that might not last forever (good to know the local sys admins).</p><p>I recently got my hands on the latest Jon Catler CD. I like it; though I would completely record and do different things with the guitar and microtonality on the aesthetic side.</p><p>&gt;Did you come across any courses -- universities or Online -- that can help &gt;begin at the beginning?  Of course, I understand that your problem is not &gt;so acute as mine.  In my csae, I would have to really begin at tne &gt;beginning, unlike you.</p><p>I have not formally studied any theory. My composition with the guitar and electronic music is purely from what I &quot;hear in my head&quot; at this point (and I hear a lot and those notes seem to be falling between the keys and frets of the instruments before me). I am working through Harmonic Experience by Walter Mathieu. It is going very slowly, but I am also a full time student and do contract work on the side and that leaves little time to move forward with music theory.</p><p>Hope to make some good contacts and get into good conversations this weekend. I have a lot to say about my peer group and the music that is popular and undeground (esoteric). I also have a very open mind and am patient to sit quietly and just learn from those that have prior experience (about everyone else on this list)! So, I won&apos;t post much until I have some good questions. If anyone is interested in corresponding privately by all means please do get in contact. I have a personal interest in all of this, so I am moving forward inch by inch.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3><a id=45513 href="#45513">ðŸ”—</a>improvist6ftman &#x3C;improvist@usa.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2003 4:56:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I just joined this group, having been referred here through the Just Intonation<br/>Network.

Each<br/>key is separately programmable: the user decides what sounds should come from<br/>different finger locations and pressures....&quot;<br/>    [quotes from _Gravikords, Whirlies, &amp; Pyrophones: Experimental Musical<br/>Instruments_ written and produced by Bart Hopkin, foreword by Tom Waits,<br/>Ellipsis Arts, 1996]</p><p>    Personally, I am more intrigued and taken with microtonal acoustic and<br/>electro-acoustic instruments - esp&apos;ly metal percussion and droning<br/>strings/springs/&quot;ribbons&quot; &amp; rods (i.e. bamboo tube-zithers, stick-zithers [i.e. vina, sitar<br/>and tambura] and longboard zithers [i.e. qin, koto, kayagum, etc.];<br/>bullroarers; spinning buzz-disks and buzzsticks; jawharps; perpetually out-of-tune toy<br/>pianos; hurdy-gurdies; discarded, semi-dysfunctional music boxes and<br/>noise-making toys; _objets trouve_/&quot;found objects&quot;, etc.)</p><p>    From memory, my hyperpolyglot Russian friend Yuri &quot;Ure&quot; Mayakovskii<br/>recently wrote the following short neo-Joycean prose-poem to describe his &quot;first<br/>best&quot; impressions of my live improv performances in Houston, Texas circa<br/>very-late-1980&apos;s:</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; sonically channelinchallengin late, great Toru Takemitsu-San<br/>re-incarn-elated &gt;&gt;reriverrerunn&apos;dfastpastslamdancedzorn as dha Feral Kid / a la dhat _Road<br/>&gt;&gt;Warrior_ flick / inna lush mutatus.mutatandi fungoid landscRape o&apos;<br/>MaxSurrealist &gt;&gt;Ernest&apos;s painting _Europe After the Rain_ with CyberMeestahrrr Bruce<br/>Sterling&apos;s &gt;&gt;sci-fi eco-set in post-revolution Green Brunei ...<br/>&gt;&gt;      plentiattitude sonoDaDa  --- nada sonata, mulch offdacuff.<br/>&gt;&gt;      Ur  AUM (non-0hm, verfall just-is noh electricity  ---<br/>&gt;&gt;              jus&apos; raw harmonic insektsions &apos;n&apos; ruff<br/>galax-o-diezectorzpazmizmz)<br/>&gt;&gt;  Ah!
