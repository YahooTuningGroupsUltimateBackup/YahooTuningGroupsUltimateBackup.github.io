By the way, he is also the creator of a microtunable<br/>fl&ucirc;te :<br/><a href="http://www.jeanpierrepoulin.com/Flute.htm">http://www.jeanpierrepoulin.com/Flute.htm</a><br/>And as a reminder, Jean-Pierre Poulin&apos;s website offers a good photograph of<br/>a freetune guitar :<br/><a href="http://www.jeanpierrepoulin.com/Jean-Pierre_Poulin.html">http://www.jeanpierrepoulin.com/Jean-Pierre_Poulin.html</a></p><p>I own myself a &quot;Freetune&quot; system I asked Jerome to adapt to a &quot;long strings&quot;<br/>guitar, with 24 movable frets per octave.<br/>Mark could not see it, nor my own alternative fretting systems because he<br/>came in the period of our festival, during which I am running all the time.<br/>On the other hand Mark could give to some of the people present the most<br/>incredible workshop I never been in, but that&apos;s another subject !<br/>We were also very impressed by Mark&apos;s banjo with magnetic interchangeable<br/>fretboards, very efficient and a marvel of craftsmanship.</p><p>What I like in Jerome&apos;s system (or in Vogt&apos;s, which seems more complex to<br/>build) is this : it lets you tune your guitar JUST BY EAR.<br/>The sound waste is not very bad, the main inconvenient (for me) is that it<br/>forbids pullings. Another inconvenient is the weight of the neck, as Jerome<br/>uses brass bars. He plans now to try aluminium instead. He can adapt his<br/>system on about any existing string instrument and it is not out of price.<br/>I think there are so many systems I could tune a string instrument myself<br/>that I found it worth to take a little time to experiment, to feel and<br/>practice, before to decide which fretting(s) to use on a definitive<br/>instrument (and of course with wider frets wherever it is possible).<br/>To start from no theorical choice can be interesting.<br/>If you are a microtonalist, wether you are tempering or not, movable frets<br/>are a wonderful blind test, that can help you to understand what you are<br/>doing. That&apos;s what I wish to do with this quartertone guitar : once I am<br/>perfectly happy with it, I will take the measurements and analyse what I<br/>did. We plan to do the same thing with the few other owners of &quot;Freetune&quot;<br/>systems here.<br/>I guess you could do that also with a synthesizer, with even more precision,<br/>except that by entering the intervals in cents a microtonalist might be<br/>influenced by his own theories...??<br/>What about analyse works on voice pitch ?</p><p>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jak Dudon</p><p>le 22/10/08 8:28, Mark Rankin &agrave; markrankin95511@... a &eacute;crit&nbsp;:</p><p>Daniel,</p><p>As you may know, in late August French microtonalist Jacques Dudon held his<br/>annual  music festival in the south of France near Le Thoronet.  It was the<br/>eighth in a series of festivals which went by the name &quot;Les Noces<br/>Harmoniques&quot; (The Harmonic Weddings).  Sadly, it was to be the last of the<br/>festivals, due to a cutback in french government funding for the arts.  In<br/>another twist, Jacques changed the spelling of his name to Jak Dudon.</p><p>Fortunately, I was able to attend the last of Jak&apos;s wonderful festivals, and<br/>I was also able to meet Jerome Desigaud and to play Jerome&apos;s unique<br/>&quot;Freetune&quot; guitar which he designed himself.  It&apos;s difficult to describe<br/>Jerome&apos;s fretboard, but I&apos;ll do my best.</p><p>On the neck are six separate long narrow flat inflexible cast brass<br/>fingerboards which are firmly attached at the ends of the fingerboards and<br/>are raised a little bit above the wooden neck.  One of the six narrow<br/>inflexible brass fingerboards lies under each string.</p><p>Each fretlet is composed of thin hollow brass tubing the same length as the<br/>narrow fingerboards are wide.  Before using nylon cord to tie the little<br/>hollow brass tubes to the narrow fingerboards, the tubes are flattened on<br/>the underside, which gives them the same profile as solid fretwire, with the<br/>rounded side up and the flat side down.</p><p>You&apos;re right about fretlets being cumbersome (and time-consuming) when you<br/>want to rearrange them for a different tuning of the open strings or a<br/>different layout of the fretlets.  Another drawback, which Jerome mentioned,<br/>is that the nylon cord used to tie the fretlets to the six individual-string<br/>fingerboards tends to absorb vibration, which diminishes the instrument&apos;s<br/>volume.</p><p>The system of magnetic interchangeable fretboards which Tom Stone invented<br/>around 1978, and which I inherited in 1984, allows guitar frettings to be<br/>&quot;swapped-out&quot; in about six seconds.  I&apos;m not trying to boast, but suspect<br/>that once the use of metallic or ceramic magnets is perfected in<br/>interchangeable fretboards, the superiority of interchangeable fretboards<br/>for microtonal fretted instruments will become even more apparent than it<br/>already is.<br/>-- Mark Rankin</p><p>--- On Tue, 10/21/08, daniel_anthony_stearns<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>From: daniel_anthony_stearns &lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Les guitares microtonales de Jean-Pierre POULIN<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Tuesday, October 21, 2008, 5:04 AM</p><p>hello there mark. If you look at the guitar he&apos;s calling<br/>the &quot;freetune&quot;, it seems very similar to the Vogt design, though it&apos;s<br/>somewhat hard to tell for sure as there&apos;s no additional info. So<br/>assuming this, by &quot;sliding door&quot; i simply mean some<br/>mechanisms/modifica tion that allows one to slide frets in a <a href="http://track.In">track.In</a><br/>both these guitars the tracks are cut under each string<br/>necessitating &quot;fretlets&quot;.this is of course great for absolute freedom<br/>of intonational choice and accuracy, but also cumbersome if you&apos;re<br/>hoping to dial up various different ETs. So what i&apos;d love to see is a<br/>setup where you retain the Vogt design and the endless possibilities<br/>of the fretlets, but also one where you could run full frets along<br/>the two outer tracks of the E strings making various ETs somewhat<br/>less of a chore to dial in.</p><p>daniel</p></div><h3><a id=78790 href="#78790">ðŸ”—</a>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2008 5:04:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; FwIW, what i&apos;d personally love to see (HAVE!/ is a setup<br/>&gt; where you retain all the fretlet goodness of infinite<br/>&gt; possibility and super fine-tuning, but also one where<br/>&gt; you have a near as possible Intonation Erector Set were<br/>&gt; you have a pile of moveable/fixable 1, 2, 3 ,4, 5, and 6<br/>&gt; string fret/fretlets at your disposal....
