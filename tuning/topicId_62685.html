Seeing as the<br/>&gt; &gt; majority of Arabs today learn music theory WITHOUT any commas, it is a<br/>&gt; &gt; dichotomy how any comma could be Arabic!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s puzzling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>The bottom line is, there is no such thing as the Arabian comma, unless one<br/>considers 3088/3011 which is a 44 cent diesis given by Mikhail Mushaqa<br/>between the 4th and 5th degrees of his quarter-tone system.</p><p>&gt; &gt; On the contrary, Erol Sayan, composer extraordinaire of Turkish &grave;Art&grave;<br/>&gt; Music<br/>&gt; &gt; claims that the comma is the basis of National Turkish Music. He even<br/>&gt; &gt; goes to the ends of the earth to re-discover America and calculate the<br/>&gt; &gt; Holdrian comma, while failing to recognize it as such. Who is this<br/>Holder<br/>&gt; &gt; fellow anyway?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought you knew ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>The William Holder of the 18th century?</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2005 11:56:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Yahya,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Le 8 Dec 2005, mon fr&egrave;re Ozan Yarman a &eacute;crit:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I do have more to say on this matter, but not all at<br/>&gt; &gt; once I&apos;m sure.

I haven&apos;t been following this thread,<br/>&gt; and so don&apos;t really know what you guys are talking about,<br/>&gt; but i *can* clarify some terminology here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Sesquitertian&quot; is an old Latin term, probably used first<br/>&gt; by Boethius c.505 AD. &quot;Sesqui&quot; is a prefix meaning &quot;one more&quot;,<br/>&gt; so &quot;sesquitertian&quot; literally means &quot;one more than 3&quot;,<br/>&gt; which indicates the ratio 4/3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Presumably the &quot;sesquitertian harmony&quot; Ozan is referring<br/>&gt; to is one that is based on perfect-4ths.</p><p>Thanks for the correction!  I should have said<br/>that I _think_ that sesqui means one and a half.<br/>Obviously a failure of generalisation from the only<br/>other example I knew of, namely &quot;sesquicentenary&quot;,<br/>as used on an Australian stamp of 1953 that<br/>commemorated 150 years of European settlement<br/>of Tasmania.</p><p>Though how they would obtain the meaning 150 years<br/>from morphemes meaning &quot;one more than a century&quot;<br/>entirely defeats my understanding ...</p><p>Ozan has confirmed that he meant harmonies based<br/>on stacked fourths, rather than stacked thirds.  It&apos;s<br/>my guess that many of us have played with stacking<br/>fourths, seconds, even fifths - I have some examples<br/>in my manuscript notes dated in the late sixties - and<br/>like many interesting ideas, will probably be<br/>independently rediscovered many times over.</p><p>With alternative tunings such as 53-EDO, considered<br/>as a scale in its own right (as Gene for one is happy to<br/>do, not needing to consider it as a gamut from which<br/>to draw only a handful or two of notes per octave to<br/>form a scale), it may make perfectly good sense to<br/>build harmonies by stacking, say, &quot;eighteenths&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.13.13/197 - Release Date: 9/12/05</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2005 1:42:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan and Mohajeri,</p><p>On Sun, 11 Dec 2005 Ozan wrote:<br/>&gt; As great a philosopher as he may be, he is<br/>&gt; also the first to import Greek genera of<br/>&gt; tetrachords to the Islamic middle-east.<br/>&gt; How compatible these were to the practice<br/>&gt; of the day is a mystery.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt;   From: Mohajeri Shahin<br/>...<br/>&gt;   Farabi,as mentioned in his great book ,had<br/>&gt; studied The theories of Aristoxenos and the<br/>&gt; others . his book &quot; moosighi-al-kabir &quot; was<br/>&gt; wrote as his student wanted him for gathering<br/>&gt; musical knowledge. farabi in the preface of<br/>&gt; the book writes that this book includes works<br/>&gt; of the past and himself&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;..&quot; so he was the<br/>&gt; first who introduced theoretical basis of<br/>&gt; 144-edo in islamic middle east .</p><p>Was that in the same book, &quot;moosighi-al-kabir&quot;<br/>(&quot;The Great Music&quot;)?

Obviously, this implies 144-edo.</p><p>I describe a mathematical procedure which exactly follows<br/>his descriptions, wherein a &quot;ditone&quot; (major-3rd) is tuned<br/>by concords but then is assumed to be a logarithmic 4/5 of<br/>a &quot;perfect-4th&quot;. Assuming the perfect-4th to be a pythagorean<br/>4/3 ratio, this leads to a smallest division of (4/3)^(1/60),<br/>and was the division described by Cleonides, whose work is<br/>a main source for Aristoxenos.</p><p>But one cannot assume Aristoxenos&apos;s &quot;perfect-4th&quot; to be<br/>a 4/3 ratio, because of the discrepancy of the size of<br/>&quot;concords&quot; in his &quot;tuning by concords&quot; method, as mentioned<br/>above.</p><p>So ultimately, 144-edo seems to be the best tuning to assume<br/>for the fitting together of all the disparate and seemingly<br/>contradictory statements made by Aristoxenos. That&apos;s why<br/>i used 144-edo for the tuning of the notated illustrations<br/>and audio examples at the end of my webpage.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2005 2:34:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan,</p><p>On Tue, 13 Dec 2005 you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would have someone tell me, rather, howcome 1200/53 cents is ascribed<br/>the<br/>&gt; saucy definition: &grave;Arabian comma&grave;, when Arabs are not known to use<br/>commas -<br/>&gt; much less 53-tET - at all in their interpretation of Maqam Music theory.

But does this really make<br/>&gt; sense?  On the same page, and immediately<br/>&gt; above this statement, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;APPENDICES - other mathematical possibilities for measuring<br/>Aristoxenus&apos;s<br/>&gt; genera<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

Rational - Ptolemy, me&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, if &quot;Aristoxenus did not carry the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning out far enough to derive the quarter-tones<br/>&gt; from it&quot;, is it reasonable to assume that he ever<br/>&gt; contemplated 144-EDO?</p><p>Sure!</p><p>&gt; It seems to me that the<br/>&gt; most likely reasons for anyone&apos;s choosing 144-EDO<br/>&gt; would be to allow further rational division of 12<br/>&gt; equal semitones into halves, quarters, sixths and<br/>&gt; twelfths - the simplest of these being the quarter-<br/>&gt; tone.  Had he contemplated 144-EDO, it can hardly<br/>&gt; have escaped his notice that it supports quarter-<br/>&gt; tones.</p><p>Of course they didn&apos;t! He mentions quarter-tones explicitly. But the<br/>point here is that these additional notes are *not* obtained by<br/>carrying out Pythagorean tuning (which is a chain of pure<br/>fifths/fourths, aka 3-limit JI) far enough to obtain anything like a<br/>quarter-tone. Instead, the quarter-tones are obtained by *equal<br/>division* (or something quite similar).</p><p>&gt; In perplexity,<br/>&gt; Yahya</p><p>I tried replying because it didn&apos;t seem to me that Monz addressed<br/>your perplexity here, but maybe he did . . .</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2005 6:00:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That would make it more Islamic than Arabic (rather than Arabian, which<br/>denotes a land mass).

But does this really make<br/>&gt; &gt; sense?  On the same page, and immediately<br/>&gt; &gt; above this statement, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -----------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;APPENDICES - other mathematical possibilities for measuring<br/>&gt; Aristoxenus&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; genera<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. Cleonides&apos;s (4/3)^(1/30)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. 144-tET - a useful approximation to Aristoxenus&apos;s system, much<br/>&gt; &gt; less sophisticated than 318-tET<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3. very extended Pythagorean - I was speculating that this was a<br/>&gt; &gt; possibility for Aristoxenus, but Macran 1902 [p 247] gives Plutarch<br/>&gt; &gt; [33.1145] quoting Aristoxenus:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the magnitude of this interval (i.e., the quarter-tone) cannot be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; determined by concord, as can the semitone, the tone, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This passage clearly indicates that Aristoxenus did not carry the<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagorean tuning out far enough to derive the quarter-tones<br/>&gt; &gt; from it; it just as clearly indicates, however, that Aristoxenus<br/>&gt; &gt; expected to be able to derive his Pythagorean semitones from the<br/>&gt; &gt; method of Tuning by Concords.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; give extent of system: to 12 tones as described in A&apos;s Tuning by<br/>&gt; &gt; Concords&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. Rational - Ptolemy, me&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -----------<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So, if &quot;Aristoxenus did not carry the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning out far enough to derive the quarter-tones<br/>&gt; &gt; from it&quot;, is it reasonable to assume that he ever<br/>&gt; &gt; contemplated 144-EDO?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that the<br/>&gt; &gt; most likely reasons for anyone&apos;s choosing 144-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; would be to allow further rational division of 12<br/>&gt; &gt; equal semitones into halves, quarters, sixths and<br/>&gt; &gt; twelfths - the simplest of these being the quarter-<br/>&gt; &gt; tone.  Had he contemplated 144-EDO, it can hardly<br/>&gt; &gt; have escaped his notice that it supports quarter-<br/>&gt; &gt; tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course they didn&apos;t! He mentions quarter-tones explicitly. But the<br/>&gt; point here is that these additional notes are *not* obtained by<br/>&gt; carrying out Pythagorean tuning (which is a chain of pure<br/>&gt; fifths/fourths, aka 3-limit JI) far enough to obtain anything like a<br/>&gt; quarter-tone. Instead, the quarter-tones are obtained by *equal<br/>&gt; division* (or something quite similar).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In perplexity,<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried replying because it didn&apos;t seem to me that Monz addressed<br/>&gt; your perplexity here, but maybe he did . . .</p><p>You both did! :-) - by emphasising the fact (previously<br/>unknown to me) that Aristoxenos did actually discuss<br/>quartertones and further divisions of them.
