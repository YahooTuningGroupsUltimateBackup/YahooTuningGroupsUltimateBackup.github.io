I just wanted to mention how nice it<br/>was to meet &quot;in the flesh&quot; as it were at the Microthon, many people<br/>I&apos;ve corresponded with for a year on the Tuning List...</p><p>..including, Paul Erlich, Pat Pagano and Carl Lumma.</p><p>It&apos;s actually an interesting experience to get to know people &quot;on<br/>line&quot; first... it makes the personal meeting even more special, since<br/>there is always a contrast or comparison with what you think a<br/>person would &quot;really&quot; be like!</p><p>The discussion came up that, actually, such occurrences happened more<br/>in previous centuries... when people were forced to correspond more<br/>and then, eventually, met the person they were corresponding with...</p><p>A notable exception, I believe, was Tchaikovsky, who received<br/>his stipend from his benefactress Nadezhda von Meck on the condition<br/>that he never see her...as you know.  But, no reason to get into<br/>THOSE complications (!!)</p><p>Kudos, of course, to Johnny Reinhard, who made it all possible, and<br/>who created the event that brought so many people together from all<br/>over the place!</p><p>________ ____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
