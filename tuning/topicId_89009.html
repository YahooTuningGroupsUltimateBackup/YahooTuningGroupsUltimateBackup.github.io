That seems to be the sweet spot in it by far to my ears...the rest seems pretty bastardized (either the ratios from sour dyads relative to the root or form many sour dyads relative to many other notes in the tuning).</p><p>When you say &quot;this is distinctly better&quot; my question becomes &quot;better for what dyads or what chords&quot;?  There seems to be an overflow of people saying things like &quot;this is excellent for 11,9,7,5...limit&quot; or &quot;this is more in tune&quot; without saying what they are trying to tune to...and I&apos;m fairly sure &quot;anything in the x-limit tonality diamond&quot; does not count as specific as people can like certain, say, 9-limit intervals and hate others.  It all seems to kind of leave me with the long &quot;homework assignment&quot; of analyzing all the dyads for, say, &quot;Augene[15]&quot;, myself.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2010 1:50:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; When you say &quot;this is distinctly better&quot; my question becomes &quot;better for what dyads or what chords&quot;?</p><p>Well, for starters it has a fifth, so you can play major and minor triads, chords which may not interest you but which are important to some people.

I think you&apos;re the first person I&apos;ve heard describe it as unpleasant.  I have played 15-EDO myself on guitar, WITH distortion, and I definitely did not find it harmonically objectionable.  I think the average guitarist might find it a tad rough but still perfectly useable...especially considering that many guitarists out there can&apos;t even tune by ear (i.e. they don&apos;t notice beating until it&apos;s really bad).  15-EDO is a rough-and-rowdy tuning perfect for playing blues or anything based on simple chord progressions.</p><p>Where 15-EDO really flops, at least in my experience, is in the melody department...it just seems tough to write a good melody in any of the &lt;10-note MOS scales in 15-EDO over a chord progression, because so many notes in the melodic scales seem to clash with each other.  Just about every 15-EDO song I&apos;ve ever heard sounds good until the melody comes in.  I think the familiarity of the chords really underscores the weirdness of the melodic structures.  But in some ways, the utter simplicity of it (only 3 more notes than 12, the symmetric Blackwood scale, the &quot;all-fourths&quot; guitar tuning it makes possible) makes up for its melodic weakness.  This is why I consider it &quot;commercially-viable&quot;.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2010 9:04:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>   Did you see my 15TETfirstmelody.mp3 example sent on Fri, May 7, 2010 9:35:25 PM?<br/>I found a subset of 15TET very close in many ways to my Infinity scale (the one I think you and Gene said sounded like Porcupine)...and found loads of melodic potential with it.<br/>    Again the scale I used is 1 (root) 3 5 8 10 12 14....16 (next octave) in 15TET.</p><p>   And, of course, I used the 1.515 &quot;substitute 5th&quot; and actually love the brightness of that tone...in some cases I find it better to use than the usual 3/2 5th.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/2010 10:07:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Easley Blackwood didn&apos;t seem to mind the rough fifth of 15-EDO,</p><p>He talks about acoustic guitar helping to hide it.</p><p>&gt;and it really seems like a LOT of people on this list find it<br/>&gt;perfectly agreeable in triads.</p><p>WHO?</p><p>&gt;I think you&apos;re the first person I&apos;ve heard describe it as<br/>&gt;unpleasant.</p><p>It&apos;s grating.
