Kraig Grady has started his OWN<br/>splinter tuning group &quot;newjustintonation.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/newjustintonation">http://www.egroups.com/group/newjustintonation</a></p><p>So far, there are only 24 persons on the group... but it may grow<br/>since I also just :) applied.</p><p>I imagine the ratios might get rather large over there sometimes...</p><p>I&apos;m not quite certain that it is a good idea to &quot;splinter&quot; off from<br/>the main tuning list over disagreements in style and content, if that<br/>had anything to do with it.  I&apos;m more for &quot;plurality&quot; myself, and<br/>toleration of other peoples&apos; opinions and HEY, even PERSONALITIES!<br/>There have been onerous (one-groups, get it) postings from various<br/>people from time-to-time, but &quot;big deal.&quot; Like they say &quot;get over<br/>it.&quot;</p><p>Maybe I&apos;ve lived in New York too long, but it doesn&apos;t PHASE :) me at<br/>all, as long as we&apos;re all learning something and at least trying to<br/>communicate.</p><p>I do note that &quot;newjustintonation&quot; is a little more &quot;exclusionary&quot;<br/>than the &quot;Tuning List.&quot;  I was not allowed to immediately join, as in<br/>this list.  I supposed the idea is to &quot;filter out&quot; certain<br/>troublesome individuals.</p><p>However, for me, I AM, a bonefide card-carrying just intonationist!<br/>I have my card right here!  I have several pieces in just intonation!</p><p>I&apos;m hoping my application will be approved, and, certainly, everybody<br/>is free to start their own groups but, for the sake of diversity of<br/>viewpoints, I would urge everybody who posts to Kraig&apos;s site (and I<br/>hope they DO) will make similar postings over here, so that people<br/>don&apos;t have to constantly go &quot;back and forth&quot; and to enhance the<br/>plurality of the group.  Well, that&apos;s my admittedly &quot;biased&quot; opinion.</p><p>__________ ____ __ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
