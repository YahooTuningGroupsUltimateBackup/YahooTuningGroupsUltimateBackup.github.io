So, the beginning of the second note would<br/>appear a bit flatter than the end of the one before it even if it is<br/>in fact higher in pitch later on.</p><p>But, I expect you&apos;ve done controls for that already.</p><p>I was planning to listen to it again today and try to measure how much<br/>it seemed to go down in pitch, by playing another note and varying its<br/>frequency to the one I thought I heard it go down to. But, not possible<br/>as it won&apos;t do it any more, also even if it did maybe trying to compare<br/>notes like that will make the change go away.</p><p>Another thought, which would suggest it could be culturally based<br/>- going flat has a kind of lazy, going home, to the familiar, feel about it<br/>and going sharp has a kind of adventurous bright feel to it, going<br/>to something new.</p><p>So, could it be just that we so often hear the high thirds in the<br/>music played around us so much of the time,<br/>and so when it moves to those, they seem familiar, so flat?</p><p>Nice to know what the jerries are about now.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
