So Carl and I were really<br/>saying the same thing.</p><p>&gt;In most musical contexts the odds will share factors<br/>&gt;with other notes, so this can still explain prime numbers as being useful<br/>&gt;when looking at music, and why people like Partch, Doty, Canright, and<br/>&gt;others have used them.</p><p>In the context of this discussion (chords), I don&apos;t think Partch belongs in<br/>this list (though many have misunderstood him, including Gilmore). Partch<br/>looked at intervals and chords in terms of odd numbers. It is only the pitch<br/>systems of just intonation which are usefully characterized (e. g., by<br/>Partch) by their prime limit. One only needs to know how to tune the prime<br/>intervals in order to construct any interval in a just intonation tuning<br/>system; the former can be stacked in various ways to create the latter.</p></div><h3><a id=2194 href="#2194">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I think I do understand because it goes back to a<br/>conversation Carl and I were having at the time the tuning list changed<br/>servers. Carl was thinking, much as you are now, that while odd-limit may be<br/>appropriate for dyads, prime-limit may be appropriate for larger chords. I<br/>demonstrated to him with some examples (check the archives) that I thought<br/>this was an illusion. He appears to have bought my argument, as he is now<br/>using it &quot;against&quot; you.</p><p>What Carl is saying:</p><p>1. The odd-limits of _all_ intervals in the chord must be considered to<br/>understand the dissonance of the chord as a whole. The total number of<br/>intervals in a chord of n notes is n*(n-1)/2.</p><p>2. Most people, unfortunately, will only look at an n-term &quot;ratio&quot; when<br/>trying to understand the dissonance of a chord. This is a set of n integers<br/>which gives the correct proportions for the chord, and the overall set of n<br/>integers is in lowest terms.</p><p>3. In many cases, the true dissonance of the chord (as in #1) is more<br/>closely paralleled by the highest prime factor of the integers in the n-term<br/>&quot;ratio&quot; than by the highest odd factor in the n-term &quot;ratio&quot;.</p><p>4. Most people are therefore deceived into thinking that prime-limit is more<br/>important than odd-limit for understanding the dissonance of a chord.</p><p>Carl and I also mentioned &quot;coprimality&quot; and &quot;relative primality.&quot; Two (or<br/>more) numbers are coprime or relatively prime if they share no common<br/>factors. A set of prime numbers is relatively prime but the converse is not<br/>necessarily true. What really distinguishes two chords with similar-sized<br/>odd numbers in the n-term &quot;ratio&quot; representation, is not primality itself<br/>but the &quot;relative primality&quot; or &quot;coprimality&quot; of its terms. If there are<br/>terms in the ratio that share common factors, then some of the intervals are<br/>in fact simpler than the n-term &quot;ratio&quot; would indicate. E. g., in the chord<br/>8:10:12:15, although the overall 4-term &quot;ratio&quot; is in lowest terms, all<br/>pairs except 8:15 are not coprime and therefore can be reduced; thus the<br/>chord is more consonant than the size of the numbers 8, 10, 12, and 15 (or<br/>the odds 1, 3, 5, and 15) would indicate. Attributing this consonance to the<br/>low prime-limit of the chord is incorrect, albeit a common error.</p></div>
