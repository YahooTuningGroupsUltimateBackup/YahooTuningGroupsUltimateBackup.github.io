The CD is of the<br/>Russian State Symphony Capella directed by Valery Polyansky. (BTW- Its<br/>amazingly beautiful)</p><p>I used Cool Edit and Spectrogram 4.1.2, both de facto freeware programs to<br/>generate spectrograms of two sustained chords: the opening major chord<br/>lasting ~15 seconds, and the same chord appearing as the climax of the piece<br/>about 3 minutes into it, also sustained.</p><p>The opening chord is unstable and the intonation changes over the course of<br/>it as the singers get their bearings. The thirds are unmistakably equal<br/>tempered and the fifths and octaves are stretched by as much as 20 cents.</p><p>The same chord 3 minutes into the piece has just as unmistakable JUST thirds<br/>of ~ 385c and a higher third that is even 382 cents. The fifths and octaves<br/>have become perfect as well.</p><p>The verdict? I think its pretty obvious that someone played the opening<br/>chord for the singers on the piano before the tape rolled, and their valiant<br/>attempts to reproduce this bizarre tuning resulted in the first chord. By<br/>the time the same chord rolls around three minutes later they have<br/>mercifully forgotten the piano tuning and have reverted to nature.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=3420 href="#3420">ðŸ”—</a>Azi Vajravai &#x3C;vajravai@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/1999 11:45:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;I used Cool Edit and Spectrogram 4.1.2, both de facto freeware programs to<br/>generate spectrograms of two sustained chords&quot;</p><p>so if this is freeware...  how may I get a copy...  for PC even...<br/>;)<br/>Azi</p><p>_______________________________________________________________<br/>Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
