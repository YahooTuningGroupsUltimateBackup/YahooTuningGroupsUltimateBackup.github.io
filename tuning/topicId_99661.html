Tuning is a set of concrete pitch relationships, expressible in cents values, temperament is a set of abstract (and somewhat flexible) pitch relationships, expressible in terms of a mapping (which defines a set of commas).</p><p>&gt; My point being that it&apos;s not just about this list....you go out<br/>&gt; there in the world and talk to other musicians, saying &quot;Father&quot;<br/>&gt; temperament would elicit a blank stare or a laugh, whereas 8edo has &gt; a chance of being understood.</p><p>But we&apos;re not &quot;out in the world&quot;, we&apos;re on this list.  We engage in academic discussions here, would you demand an academic physics journal to put everything in layman&apos;s terms?  Here these terms have concrete and well-understood meanings and are useful in our discussions.  Why would we abandon them?  We don&apos;t talk to each other as if talking to musicians who know nothing of microtonality.  I&apos;d never use the terminology I use here on outsiders.  So your &quot;point&quot; is totally invalid.</p><p>&gt; And if you are talking about a linear temperament instead of an<br/>&gt; edo, you can still give the size of the &apos;fifth&apos; in terms of<br/>&gt; rational divisions of the octave (e.g. 1/4 comma meantone<br/>&gt; temperament is pretty well described by<br/>&gt; 18\31 of an octave as a generator)</p><p>It&apos;s not simple when dealing with other temperaments.  The regular mapping paradigm means that some tunings can be interpreted as multiple mappings, and the question of which temperament best describes a certain tuning is not always straightforward to answer.  In the case of Father, you can define the &quot;fifth&quot; as being 5\8 of an octave, but when you look at something very near (but not exactly) that value like 17\27 or 13\21 it becomes questionable whether the Father mapping really applies, because in some cases you get a better 5/4 further along the generator chain than the one the Father mapping gives you.</p><p>If we&apos;re going to talk about linear temperaments, it&apos;s helpful to know if what we&apos;re talking about is musical reality or numerical fancy.  So while 18\31 may be a good estimation of the Meantone generator, it&apos;s not clear that the Father generator can really be &quot;estimated&quot; at all, or if it *only* applies to 8-EDO.  People have been in the habit of calling 13-EDO a Father temperament, when in reality other 5-limit mappings describe it much better, since the Father mapping says the ~461-cent interval is the 5/4, whereas there&apos;s a much better 5/4 at around ~369 cents.</p><p>Seriously, Aaron, I don&apos;t know why you poke your nose into the jargon-fest just to decry our use of jargon.  The only way we could do away with the silly names is by specifying the mapping or the commas of every temperament we talk about.  The names are there to save us the trouble of typing out a mapping every time we want to talk about various temperaments.  I should think a discussion liberally punctuated by what basically look like matrices would be even more of a turn-off to musicians than a discussion peppered with obscure nomenclature.  What looks nicer to you: the word &quot;Father&quot;, or</p><p>[1 1 3]<br/>[0 1 -1]</p><p>?</p><p>What would you even call that in speech?</p><p>Can you imagine what a discussion of planar temperaments would look like, or subgroups?  Or if we were doing commas instead of mappings, is that really any better?  I can&apos;t even remember the commas to most of the temperaments that get talked about here.  Do you know the ratio to the schisma by heart?  I don&apos;t.  It would be a nightmare.  The names exist for good reason, and the xenwiki is there for anyone who doesn&apos;t know what a given temperament name refers to.  So quit yer belly-achin&apos;.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2011 11:41:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jun 1, 2011 at 10:01 AM, Aaron Krister Johnson<br/>&lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Neat.

Like playing up and down the scale, there would always come a point where something &quot;weird&quot; would happen and I would totally freak out. Maybe because I&apos;d play 2 2 1 2 2 and find myself at a minor 6th instead of a major 6th, I dunno. But after playing with this scale for a few years now, that doesn&apos;t happen any more.

Now, if you notice, the C-D-E-F-G has been smushed<br/>in such a fashion that the C-D-E is ~10:11:12, the E-G is now 7/6, and<br/>the C-G is 1/2 octave. You need to snap your perception into hearing<br/>the 3 3 1 3 as a really, really flat C-D-E-F-G from the diatonic<br/>scale.</p><p>The crazy thing now is that this ultra-flat &quot;G&quot; is in a sense the<br/>&quot;dominant&quot; of the tonic, but then the dominant of the dominant is the<br/>tonic again. Don&apos;t worry about ratios and just focus on perception. If<br/>you are curious about ratios, the idea here is that 4:5:6 is replaced<br/>by 5:6:7, and 8:9:10:12 is replaced by 10:11:12:14, and 4/3 is<br/>replaced by 9/7.</p><p>Something about the 2 2 1 2 pattern is trippy, but I&apos;m not sure what it is.</p><p>&gt; The fact that this scale does this with fifths makes it a particularly good example, but there are other scales that f*** with our intervallic perception just as heavily. Blackwood[10] in 20-EDO, for instance, gives us two &quot;minor 7ths&quot;--one at 960 cents, one at 1020 cents.</p><p>Yes, but Blackwood tends to confuse the hell out of me, whereas this<br/>scale doesn&apos;t. That&apos;s where I&apos;m at with this now.</p><p>&gt;The first one is from a stack of fourths, the second one is a fifth above the minor 3rd. Actually, you can also have two fifths in 20-EDO Blackwood, too--the 660-cent &quot;pelog&quot; fifth and the 720-cent &quot;Blackwood&quot; fifth. Thus two fourths as well. And two whole-tones (inversions of minor 7ths). That does a real job on me, mentally.</p><p>YMMV, but father[8] for some reason does NOT do a real job on me,<br/>mentally.

Yeah, it&apos;s like four temperaments in one, based on how we&apos;re hearing it.  THAT is far-out.  This is why I love exotemperaments, because the high-entropy intervals can collapse in either direction and totally blow some minds.</p><p>&gt; It took me a couple days to go native with it.

Don&apos;t worry about ratios and just focus on<br/>&gt; perception.</p><p>Reminds me a little bit of chord progressions in Lemba.  Two 4:5:7 triads a half-octave apart can sound like tonic and dominant to me sometimes.</p><p>&gt; Something about the 2 2 1 2 pattern is trippy, but I&apos;m not sure<br/>&gt; what it is.</p><p>The weird thing to me is that a 2 2 3 2 pattern (a la Mavila) works the same mojo for me.

Not a fan of 16:18:21 then, eh?  Try the 18-EDO version, I think it sounds very concordant (although not super &quot;restful&quot; or &quot;resolved&quot;).  As far as harmonies not based on 4:5:6 go, I quite enjoy the sound of these triads.  Also there are two approximate 8:9:10 triads (which you can voice as 4:5:9 for added concordance), and also (in 13-EDO only) a couple &quot;Orwell-esque&quot; triads of 0-276-554 cents, where every dyad in the chord is an 11-limit consonance (these are both Paul&apos;s and Graham&apos;s words).  There&apos;s also a couple of 8:11:13 triads to be had, too.  Frankly I find this to be a very concordant scale as long as you&apos;re not trying to play the very out-of-tune &quot;5-limit&quot; Father triads of 0-462-738 cents, the Uncle triads of 0-369-738, or the unnamed triads of 0-369-646 cents.</p><p>I actually like the entire Father/Uncle pentatonic scale as a pentad, 0-185-462-646-923 cents, or even better in 23-EDO as 0-209-470-678-939 cents or 18-EDO as 0-200-466.67-666.67-933.33 cents.  I think the smoothness of the dyads trumps the entropy of the pentad in this case, and although the result is not as smooth as 4:5:6:7:9 or something, I think it sounds pleasant and exotic nonetheless.

To blatantly ignore that there is an interval in 13-EDO that sounds much more like a 5/4 than does the interval prescribed by the Father mapping is, well, stupid.</p><p>&gt; Just because there is a better mapping (in your opinion) for the tuning doesn&apos;t mean any &gt; other is invalid.

There are limits to how badly we can temper something before it no longer becomes a sensible approximation.  Some tunings support multiple mappings--23-EDO, for instance, supports two mappings of 3, and two mappings of 5, among other things.  These mappings work because both approximations are equally sensible (or insensible, depending on your personal tolerance for mistuning).  Even in 22-EDO, it makes some sense to apply a meantone mapping to the superpyth major scale, because in that 7-note scale, the closest thing to a 5/4 is a 9/7, so if we wanted to be obstinate we could reasonably call it a 5/4.  This stops being true when we get to the 12-note MOS of superpyth, and at that point we&apos;d be foolish to insist on calling the 9/7 a 5/4, since there is a near-Just 5/4 staring us in the face at another place in the scale.</p><p>In 13-EDO, in the 5L+3s scale, there are two instances of an interval that are much closer to a 5/4 than the Father generator, and it&apos;s stupid to ignore that.  You have on one hand an interval that&apos;s about 17 cents flat, and on the other an interval that&apos;s about 74 cents sharp.  Are you telling me that you can think of a reason to ignore the better approximation and insist that the 74-cent sharp interval is the 5/4 in the scale??  That is just **STUPID**.  ON THE OTHER HAND, In the 3L+2s pentatonic scale, the Father generator *is* the closest thing to a 5/4 that appears, so we may call that pentatonic scale a &quot;Father&quot; pentatonic.</p><p>We have to exercise good sense when talking about mappings and scales.  This is the same reason that calling the 5L+2s scale in 29-EDO &quot;Schismatic/Helmholtz&quot; is stupid, because the mapping for Helmholtz takes 8 generators to produce the approximation to 5/4, thus the Schismatic 5/4 doesn&apos;t appear in the 7-note MOS.  Strictly-speaking, Schismatic doesn&apos;t exist as a temperament below a certain size of MOS, unless you&apos;re using a MODMOS or something where the Schismatic 5/4 is actually present in the scale.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve definitely heard 480 cents of 5-edo as a 5/4, so it&apos;s not thaaat crazy.</p><p>In 5-EDO, 480 cents is the closest thing to a 5/4 you&apos;ve got, so it&apos;s not unreasonable to map 5/4 to 480 cents (if you are insisting on mapping it to anything, which is a questionable thing to insist on in 5-EDO).  But the real important thing is, given a set of intervals in a particularly-tuned tempered scale, the sensible mapping is the one that maps the JI intervals to their nearest tempered approximants *available in the scale*.  To fail to do this is to contradict your own ears in the mapping--why would anyone *want* to do that?  What is to be gained from ignoring the presence of audibly better approximations and insisting on a perceptually-invalid mapping?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2011 9:18:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs:<br/>&gt;&gt; The community is still small enough that we can stop the spread of inconsistent<br/>&gt;&gt; terminology before it gets much further.  13-EDO is not Father, 11-EDO is not Hanson,<br/>&gt;&gt; etc.</p><p>John:<br/>&gt; Why is 11-edo not Hanson?</p><p>Respectfully: because Hanson is an abstract temperament, and 11-EDO is<br/>a specific, concrete scale that instantiates it.</p><p>&gt; If I&apos;m using the 327 cent generator as a 6/5 and six iterations as 3/1, how is it not<br/>&gt; Hanson?

Maybe under some extreme circumstances, but put it next to 700 cents, and it&apos;s obvious that 600 cents is NOT a 3/2.  And anyway the regular mapping paradigm is not meant to vary from person to person, or to account for &quot;extreme&quot; listening environments generated by artificial scale-mapped timbres.  It is meant to fit the most commonly agreed-upon consensus of reasonable &quot;average&quot; listeners listening to &quot;normal&quot; harmonic timbres.  That&apos;s the only way to consistently define the paradigm, and if you&apos;re not interested in the consensus view of it, I&apos;d suggest that there&apos;s no point in using it, because you&apos;re obviously taking it into territory it is not suited for.</p><p>&gt; Again, this is part of that same spectrum of tolerance.

Don&apos;t make the mistake of thinking that just because you hear &quot;major triad&quot; that that means you&apos;re hearing &quot;4:5:6&quot;.</p><p>&gt; In fact, when playing in 22-edo meantone for long enough, the &quot;sharp&quot; 5/4 actually<br/>&gt; sounds MORE like 5/4 than the &quot;purer&quot; one.

Try playing in 22-EDO diaschismic a bit instead and see if you still hear the &quot;sharp&quot; 9/7 as a 5/4 in comparison to the true 5/4.  In any case this still has nothing to do with Father.</p><p>&gt; So if I want my meantone mapping in 22-edo specifically because it lines up with the<br/>&gt; mapping and melodic expectations I&apos;ve built up from other tunings of the same scale<br/>&gt; structure, I see nothing foolish, stupid, or wrong with that.</p><p>Like I said, if you&apos;re using the 7-note MOS, that Superpyth 9/7 is the closest thing to a 5/4 in the scale, so if you had to describe the scale in the 5-limit, it would fit the meantone mapping.  OTOH, it&apos;s also arguable that you&apos;re NOT hearing a 5/4, because that interval *is* a 9/7, and those triads *are* 14:18:21.  You *are* hearing major triads and something about the diatonic structure actually biases your perception such that when presented with a 5/4, it sounds too &quot;low&quot; to be a major 3rd.  But this is as much evidence for the conclusion that &quot;major 3rd-ness&quot; has nothing to do with 5/4 as it is evidence for the conclusion that a 9/7 can sound like a 5/4.  Personally, I think if we want to accept the latter, we have to throw out JI as a load of hogwash, because if we can conflate ratios that easily, the ratios themselves are actually psychoacoustically meaningless.  And if that&apos;s the case, we have to toss the regular temperament paradigm too, because if the ratios are mutable then tempered versions of them are doubly so.</p><p>&gt; Following that, if I want my Father mapping specifically because it lines up with the<br/>&gt; mapping and melodic expectation I&apos;ve built up from other tunings of the same scale<br/>&gt; structure, I see nothing wrong with that.</p><p>You have to ask yourself what you&apos;re really mapping and what the significance of mapping actually is, then.  If you are hearing 462 cents as &quot;more&quot; of a 5/4 than 369 cents, what that means right there, plain as day, is that error is meaningless and temperament and mapping are a farce.  It&apos;s as insane as looking at a black square on the left and a white square on the right, and saying &quot;as I see it, the square on the left is white, and the square on the right is black.&quot;  It basically means our perception of intervals has *nothing* to do with how they are tuned and everything to do with some other factor--melodic cues, preattentive bias, etc.--and if that&apos;s the case, there&apos;s no point in even TALKING about JI anymore.  The ratio 5/4 is psychoacoustically meaningless if something 74 cents from a 5/4 sounds somehow &quot;more like&quot; a 5/4 than something 17 cents away from a 5/4.  If that is in fact the case, then what you are hearing has nothing to do with frequency ratios at all, so &quot;temperament&quot; as we understand it is irrelevant as a descriptor for what is happening in that scale.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2011 12:40:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; That 16/11 sometimes sounds like a fifth to me.

So for instance if you take an interval of 462 cents and hold it, and then try to tweak the tuning to make the beating stop, if you tune it down to a 5/4 and think &quot;there, that&apos;s what it&apos;s supposed to sound like&quot;, then you&apos;re hearing it as a 5/4.  If you&apos;d tune it up to a 4/3, then that&apos;s what you&apos;re hearing it as.

I say this because I *know* that if John simply heard the two chords (the ~14:18:21 and the ~4:5:6) in isolation, he would undoubtedly identify the ~4:5:6 as being the better approximation of 4:5:6--barring any wacky timbral/spectral tricks, of course.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2011 10:06:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&quot;hanson&quot; is presented, in negative form, in the MGG article</p><p>MGG = ?</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2011 10:09:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>By definition.

Hanson isn&apos;t really something which can be heard as what it is if you subject it to a lot of tuning abuse. The POTE/minimax generator of 317 cents is not as flexible as the Father generator, because it&apos;s a part of the nature of Hanson that it gives accurate 5-limit triads--that&apos;s the sort of temperament it is. So, 53edo pretty well nails it and 34edo is fine, but 19edo is already stretching the point--stretching it more than using 19 for Meantone is stretching it, as Hanson is more accurate. 15edo really won&apos;t do, and 11edo is orbiting another star entirely. 11edo does not have pure, sweet 5-limit triads. The val &lt;11 18 26| belongs to Hanson algebraically, but as I&apos;ve remarked before the val &lt;36 65 116| belongs to Meantone algebraically. So I would regard Catakleismic as a natural extension of Hanson, but Keemun as something a bit different.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree, and I&apos;m glad you&apos;re backing me up on this.  However, I don&apos;t agree that the Hanson generator is less flexible than the Father generator, I think perhaps even the opposite is the case.  I don&apos;t actually even think the POTE generator for Father is consistent with Father temperament, because you get a better 5 than the mapping gets you very quickly in the generator chain--at +7 generators, and in fact as soon as you get flat of a 750-cent generator, +7 is going to be a better 5 than -1 generator. In fact between 741-742 cents you get a Just 5/4 at +7, and then slowly -6 starts to look better, until -7g=+6g (at 13-EDO, in fact), and after that -6 becomes the better 5, being near-Just between 736 and 735 cents.  Getting sharp of a 750-cent generator, OTOH, moves you quickly into Sensi territory.  So I&apos;d say that if octaves are kept pure, the only consistent generator for Father temperament is an exact 450 cents, unless we are confining ourselves to the 3L+2s pentatonic scale, in which case we never get to the better approximations of 5 within the scale and the Father mapping remains consistent.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2011 10:22:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;hanson&quot; is presented, in negative form, in the MGG article<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MGG = ?<br/>&gt;</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musik_in_Geschichte_und_Gegenwart">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musik_in_Geschichte_und_Gegenwart</a></p><p>It looks like you can find it in English, too.

I probably should have made a second version with harmonic timbres taking that into account, but the point I was trying to make was that the chord progression was comparable in each example, and I thought the timbres highlighted that the most. I guess the amount the timbres helped me hear it hurt your chances. It was made in 2032.</p><p>&gt; Are you honestly telling me that if you heard a 462-cent interval and a a 369-cent interval, you would consider the first one a 5/4 and not the second one?</p><p>Not without context. And I haven&apos;t become very familiar with the MOS scales we&apos;re referring to when it comes to father, so I haven&apos;t had time to associate the scale structure with a specific mapping, so chances are I would have trouble hearing the first one as more of a 5/4 than the second. But given my experiences with meantone, I imagine I could.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes but, again, this is a different spectrum for each person with no lines pre-drawn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is patently false.  Yes, there are variations from person to person, and if you use artificial/obscured timbres that blur harmonic identities, then things go up in the air.  But there are definite limits, especially when directly comparing two intervals.  Can 600 cents sound like a 3/2?  Maybe under some extreme circumstances, but put it next to 700 cents, and it&apos;s obvious that 600 cents is NOT a 3/2.</p><p>What if you were to get that 700 cents to sound like say... a 25/16? or an 8/5 even? Then the 600 cent interval might sound way more like a 3/2.</p><p>&gt; And anyway the regular mapping paradigm is not meant to vary from person to person, or to account for &quot;extreme&quot; listening environments generated by artificial scale-mapped timbres.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying the paradigm needs to vary. I&apos;m saying the paradigm itself has definitions with no limits, and to what extremes you stretch the paradigm is a judgment call: Harmonic or modified timbres, no previous exposure to a mapping or long term exposure, what have you.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Again, this is part of that same spectrum of tolerance. If 23-edo has two &quot;sensible&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; mappings, then this example of 22-edo is just your deciding where to draw a line for<br/>&gt; &gt; what is &quot;sensible&quot; enough to consider two optional mappings, and what is foolish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well of course decisions have to be made. The question is are they sensible, and that is a question determined by consensus.</p><p>I think that&apos;s just false. No decisions HAVE to be made, or at least not on the subject of drawing these lines. All you need is a consensus on the existence of a spectrum of limits, limits that vary person to person due to individual factors. Then sure, we could look into what those individual factors are, and that could lead to interesting insight.</p><p>If we really went by consensus, would this list even exist?</p><p>&gt; So far you haven&apos;t given any reason as to why these &quot;lines&quot; are not sensible.</p><p>So far, all I have is what I hear, which does say (to me) that the lines are not sensible.</p><p>Problem is, YOU&apos;RE the one proposing the limits, and I think that&apos;s the position that needs defending. Why are these lines YOU&apos;VE drawn defensible? What evidence have you that says there is a specific line to draw and that you have drawn it correctly somewhere between you and me, or that there is even need for this line at all and not just the recognition of a spectrum?</p><p>&gt; What evidence is there that you&apos;re hearing it as a 5/4?  Don&apos;t make the mistake of thinking that just because you hear &quot;major triad&quot; that that means you&apos;re hearing &quot;4:5:6&quot;.</p><p>&gt; OTOH, it&apos;s also arguable that you&apos;re NOT hearing a 5/4, because that interval *is* a 9/7, and those triads *are* 14:18:21. You *are* hearing major triads and something about the diatonic structure actually biases your perception such that when presented with a 5/4, it sounds too &quot;low&quot; to be a major 3rd.  But this is as much evidence for the conclusion that &quot;major 3rd-ness&quot; has nothing to do with 5/4 as it is evidence for the conclusion that a 9/7 can sound like a 5/4.</p><p>Of course my (and our) understanding of what hearing something &quot;as a 3/2&quot; actually means is not very solid. But there is a reason I&apos;m confident I&apos;m hearing this major triad in 22-edo as 4:5:6.<br/>When I play other temperaments besides meantone like magic, anti-diatonic, and even bug, I hear a sort of harmonic identity in each&apos;s 4:5:6 that I link to both their respective scale structures AND to each other. That is, I hear the &quot;same thing&quot; when I play the 4:5:6 of multiple temperaments (all of which have the 5/4 and 3/2 line up with a different melodic combinations of L and S), and I manage to hear them all as this same thing even when I mess around with the tuning of each temperament&apos;s.</p><p>I feel like they are all inherently similar, and that makes me think that I&apos;m not just hearing some &quot;other&quot; just triad like 14:18:21 when I mess with the tuning in meantone. It still &quot;sounds like&quot; it did in other meantone tunings (which COULD be melodic training), but it also sounds like it does in completely different temperaments and their different tunings (which coud NOT be melodic training.)</p><p>&gt; Personally, I think if we want to accept the latter, we have to throw out JI as a load of hogwash, because if we can conflate ratios that easily, the ratios themselves are actually psychoacoustically meaningless.</p><p>Why? Again, I&apos;m only saying that they are MORE conflatable than you are saying. What about the person who says that if YOU call 700 cents a 3/2 then we might as well throw out JI as a load of hogwash because if we can conflate ratios that easily, the ratios are psychoacoustically meaningless?

The regular mapping paradigm has no way to handle &quot;context&quot; and the attendant varieties of preattentive perceptual biases; it is all about straight-up error.  The relevance of error to perception of course varies depending on all sorts of wacky circumstances that we are just now becoming aware of, and the result is that there are places where the paradigm gets a bit messy.  It is precisely at these boundary-condition places that it becomes questionable whether or not we should even continue to use the paradigm, because if it&apos;s messy and inconsistent and contradicts our listening experience, what good is it doing us?</p><p>&gt; What if you were to get that 700 cents to sound like say... a<br/>&gt; 25/16? or an 8/5 even? Then the 600 cent interval might sound way<br/>&gt; more like a 3/2.</p><p>That would be impossible, unless you use some kind of warped timbre.  But if you&apos;re using warped timbres, ratios are pretty much meaningless anyway.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not saying the paradigm needs to vary. I&apos;m saying the paradigm &gt; itself has definitions with no limits, and to what extremes you<br/>&gt; stretch the paradigm is a judgment call: Harmonic or modified<br/>&gt; timbres, no previous exposure to a mapping or long term exposure,<br/>&gt; what have you.</p><p>Just because the paradigm does not deal in explicitly-defined limits, that does not mean there are no limits.  There&apos;s some wiggle-room, yes, and the world&apos;s not going to end if you go waaaay out into interstellar space, but the real question is, what is to be gained by stretching the limits like that?  *Why* would you want to insist that 11-EDO as a super-high-error Hanson temperament?  That&apos;s as sensible as saying 16-EDO is a Meantone.</p><p>&gt; I think that&apos;s just false. No decisions HAVE to be made, or at<br/>&gt; least not on the subject of drawing these lines.</p><p>If no decisions are made, then you could call any tuning any temperament you like, which wouldn&apos;t actually do you any good.  What makes the regular temperament paradigm useful is that it shows us ways to approximate JI with tunings that are simpler than JI and within reasonable limits of accuracy.  This is based on the idea that people cannot functionally distinguish tempered intervals from JI within a certain threshold of mistuning, and that even beyond that threshold, the &quot;identity&quot; or &quot;character&quot; of the JI interval is still retained within a wider threshold of mistuning.  This assumes that JI intervals do actually possess distinct psychoacoustic identities related to their actual tuning, which we now know to be somewhat false--intervallic identity recognition depends on more than pure frequency relationship, many many MANY factors can bias perception and/or create auditory illusions.  But we have to assume that JI intervals *do* have distinct identities related to their actual tuning, or else we&apos;re up shit creek without a paddle in terms of trying to figure out how to approximate them.  And in any case, there are definite limits even to the illusions that can be created with warped timbres.</p><p>&gt; All you need is a consensus on the existence of a spectrum of<br/>&gt; limits, limits that vary person to person due to individual<br/>&gt; factors. Then sure, we could look into what those individual<br/>&gt; factors are, and that could lead to interesting insight.</p><p>More important is the existence of a limit to the &quot;spectrum of limits&quot;.  Surely no one will mistake 200 cents or 1000 cents for a 3/2, so if we can put those &quot;off limits&quot;, why can&apos;t we draw the limits a bit closer?  Surely you can&apos;t believe that there are really NO absolutes?</p><p>&gt; If we really went by consensus, would this list even exist?</p><p>There is plenty of consensus as regards the regular temperament paradigm.  Not 100%, but no one doubts that 53-EDO is a Hanson temperament.  No one doubts that 22-EDO is a Magic temperament.  No one doubts that 72-EDO is a Miracle temperament.  Until recently, no one has also doubted that a lower-error approximation sounds more like the approximated interval than a high-error approximation.  Where there are discrepancies (some say 13-EDO is an Orwell temperament, some say it&apos;s not; some say 23-EDO is a Myna temperament, some say it&apos;s not; etc.), the sensible thing to do is to acknowledge that boundaries are being stretched and the application of a particular mapping to a particular tuning is questionable.</p><p>&gt; So far, all I have is what I hear, which does say (to me) that the &gt; lines are not sensible.</p><p>From what you&apos;ve said, it sounds like what you hear is:<br/>1) 436.36 cents sounds more like 5/4 than 381.82 cents.<br/>2) ~461 cents sounds more like 5/4 than ~370 cents.<br/>3) 763.64 cents sounds like an acceptable approximation of 3/2.  Presumably that means it also does not sound to you like a 14/9, 11/7, or 8/5, either.  Since 763.64 cents pretty much IS a 14/9, then that would also be saying 14/9 doesn&apos;t actually exist as an identity in its own right, it&apos;s just a point on the continuum of &quot;detuned 3/2&quot;.  Also that it&apos;s not subsumed into the nearer simpler identities of 11/7 or 8/5.</p><p>If this is how you hear things, I do not understand why you are interested in the regular mapping paradigm, because approximation of intervals seems to have absolutely nothing to do with, well, proximity for you.  Or maybe has something to do with proximity some percentage of the time, but not often enough for proximity to be a reliable indicator of approximation strength.</p><p>&gt; Problem is, YOU&apos;RE the one proposing the limits, and I think that&apos;s &gt; the position that needs defending. Why are these lines YOU&apos;VE drawn &gt; defensible? What evidence have you that says there is a specific<br/>&gt; line to draw and that you have drawn it correctly somewhere between &gt; you and me, or that there is even need for this line at all and not &gt; just the recognition of a spectrum?</p><p>Because the differentiation of temperaments (or temperament families, if you prefer the term) requires that there be limits.  There has to be a point where Meantone ends and Pelogic begins.  There has to be a point where Hanson ends and Amity begins, and where Amity ends and Dicot begins, etc.</p><p>The sensible place for boundaries to be drawn is where one mapping becomes lower-error than another one.  If you look at the error of 16-EDO in terms of a Meantone mapping, its error is much higher than if you look at it in terms of a Pelogic mapping.  Ergo, 16-EDO should be called a Pelogic temperament rather than a Meantone.  In the case of 11-EDO, there are plenty of other (mostly subgroup) temperaments that describe it with a lower error than if you look at it as a Hanson temperament.  In 13-EDO, the Uncle mapping describes it with a lower error than the Father mapping.  There&apos;s nothing arbitrary about this at all, it&apos;s pure math, totally objective.  And if you want to continue arguing that we should hold fast to categorizing tunings according higher-error mappings, I&apos;m going to ask you again what is to be gained by that.</p><p>And for the record, I will say that at least one person (Mike B.) has been confused--by a very strong perceptually-biasing cue--into thinking Mavila/Pelogic was a really out-of-tune Meantone, such that he was hearing minor triads as badly out-of-tune major triads.  Does that mean we ought to be open to considering the possibility that the tuning range for Meantone actually extends into Pelogic territory?  No, it does not.  It just means that, like the eyes, the ears too can be fooled by illusions.</p><p>&gt; When I play other temperaments besides meantone like magic,<br/>&gt; anti-diatonic, and even bug, I hear a sort of harmonic identity in &gt; each&apos;s 4:5:6 that I link to both their respective scale structures &gt; AND to each other. That is, I hear the &quot;same thing&quot; when I play the &gt; 4:5:6 of multiple temperaments (all of which have the 5/4 and 3/2<br/>&gt; line up with a different melodic combinations of L and S), and I<br/>&gt; manage to hear them all as this same thing even when I mess around &gt; with the tuning of each temperament&apos;s.</p><p>And yet, the only way you hear the ~14:18:21 in 22-EDO as a 4:5:6 is when it&apos;s in the context of the diatonic scale.  If I played you, out of context, the 22-EDO 4:5:6 and the 22-EDO 14:18:21, are you really going to claim that the latter would sound more like a 4:5:6 than the former?  Absent any scalar or melodic cues, in a total sonic vacuum?  Unless the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, my point stands that it is the scalar cues biasing your perception.  If the answer *is* yes, then you are effectively telling me that 14:18:21 sounds more like 4:5:6 than 4:5:6 itself does.  That is absurd, and my reductio ad absurdum is complete.</p><p>&gt; Why? Again, I&apos;m only saying that they are MORE conflatable than you &gt; are saying.</p><p>Just ratios, barring perceptually-biasing extrinsic factors, are not conflatable.  Absent any extrinsic factors (melodic cues, progressional cues, etc.), 6/5 and 5/4 are not going to be mistaken for the same interval, nor will 5/4 and 9/7, 9/7 and 4/3, 3/2 and 14/9, etc.  Extrinsic factors are capable of playing all manner of tricks on our perception, of course, but the point is they are *tricks*.  Illusions.  The possibility of these illusions of course does have ramifications for the validity of the regular temperament paradigm in general, but the paradigm has no way of addressing these tricks.  In order to use the paradigm *consistently*, one has to ignore the tricks that music can play.  Using remapped timbres basically invalidates the whole paradigm anyway, because ratios lose their psychoacoustic significance almost entirely.</p><p>&gt; What about the person who says that if YOU call 700 cents a 3/2<br/>&gt; then we might as well throw out JI as a load of hogwash?</p><p>There is no Just ratio at 700 cents that could be conflated with 3/2.  I&apos;m fairly certain everyone on this list concurs that 700 cents is a very obvious (and very accurate) approximation of 3/2.  Anyone who doesn&apos;t buy that doesn&apos;t buy the idea of approximation in general, and won&apos;t have any use for the regular temperament paradigm in general.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>jlmoriart &#x3C;JlMoriart@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2011 5:59:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I know I&apos;m not quite keeping up with the pace of the conversation, but there are a few points I&apos;d still like to make.</p><p>&gt; The sensible place for boundaries to be drawn is where one mapping becomes lower-error than another one.</p><p>I don&apos;t like this because, in the 22-edo example, the diatonic MOS is Meantone whereas the chromatic MOS isn&apos;t because it contains the better 5/4 elsewhere. But even if you are playing &quot;chromatic music&quot;, it usually involves a diatonic scale nested into the chromatic framework. Even when exposed to the D# in a C major piece, it&apos;d only ever be used in harmonic context where it is a 5/4 above B (as part of a 4:5:6, as a secondary dominant of Em), and we&apos;d probably never get the chance to even hear the D# as a 5/4 above C because we wouldn&apos;t run into them melodically together.</p><p>So even when exposed to scale structures large enough to contain much better approximations of a just interval, I still see the original mapping as viable, and definitely not contradictory.</p><p>&gt; There has to be a point where Hanson ends and Amity begins, and where Amity ends and Dicot begins, etc.</p><p>If you remember from a while back, I have a theory that as long as the harmonic series derived from a tuning and a mapping has static or decreasing interval sizes consecutively from partial to partial, we should far more *easily* hear the tuning as has having the Just characteristics the mapping describes.

Everyone is on their own trip with this stuff and no amount of arguing from me is going to change that, so I&apos;ve resolved to get back to being on my own trip with it.  Whatever floats your boat, mate.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jlmoriart&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know I&apos;m not quite keeping up with the pace of the conversation, but there are a few points I&apos;d still like to make.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The sensible place for boundaries to be drawn is where one mapping becomes lower-error than another one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t like this because, in the 22-edo example, the diatonic MOS is Meantone whereas the chromatic MOS isn&apos;t because it contains the better 5/4 elsewhere. But even if you are playing &quot;chromatic music&quot;, it usually involves a diatonic scale nested into the chromatic framework. Even when exposed to the D# in a C major piece, it&apos;d only ever be used in harmonic context where it is a 5/4 above B (as part of a 4:5:6, as a secondary dominant of Em), and we&apos;d probably never get the chance to even hear the D# as a 5/4 above C because we wouldn&apos;t run into them melodically together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So even when exposed to scale structures large enough to contain much better approximations of a just interval, I still see the original mapping as viable, and definitely not contradictory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There has to be a point where Hanson ends and Amity begins, and where Amity ends and Dicot begins, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you remember from a while back, I have a theory that as long as the harmonic series derived from a tuning and a mapping has static or decreasing interval sizes consecutively from partial to partial, we should far more *easily* hear the tuning as has having the Just characteristics the mapping describes. Basically, make it so that 2/1 &gt; 3/2 &gt; 4/3 &gt; 5/4 &gt; 6/5 &gt; 7/6 &gt; 8/7 etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this definition, every tempered comma has a definite range not having to do with how big an MOS you take into account.<br/>&gt; Some 5-limit commas:<br/>&gt; Syntonic=81/80=7-edo to 5-edo<br/>&gt; Pelogic=135/128 = 2-edo to 7-edo<br/>&gt; Porcupine=250/243= 8-edo to 7-edo<br/>&gt; Magic=3125/3072= 10-edo to 3-edo<br/>&gt; Hanson=15625/15552= 4-edo to 11-edo<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt; Each boundary is going to be an edo because 5/4=6/5 or 4/3=5/4, reducing the dimensionality. Each boundary also lines up with a boundary of an MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At 11-edo with a Hanson mapping, 5/4=4/3. Above 11-edo, 5/4&gt;4/3 so I wouldn&apos;t expect someone to easily hear Hanson above 11-edo, but I can imagine 11-edo working as Hanson, and I hear it too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Surely you can&apos;t believe that there are really NO absolutes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not with some of the weird stuff I&apos;ve heard stretching generators AND periods. All I ever expect to see is a rough correlation between:<br/>&gt; 1. The likelihood of being able to hear something as you describe it<br/>&gt; And<br/>&gt; 2.
