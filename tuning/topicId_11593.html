Of course, once just thirds are accepted, going<br/>back to 12-tET is even more difficult. I myself experience this multiple<br/>personality whenever I switch between 22-tET (where the 5:4 is only 2 cents<br/>off just) and 12-tET (where the 5:4 is 14 cents off just).</p><p>Tests of musically untrained Western subjects showed two clearly delineated<br/>categories of listeners -- one category preferred major triads just, while<br/>the other preferred major triads with the third either raised or lowered 15<br/>cents. They didn&apos;t differentiate between the raised version, very close to<br/>12-tET; and the lowered version, very different (something you might<br/>construct out of a Byzantine scale). Apparantly they just liked (perhaps<br/>through acculturation) a certain amount of &quot;richness&quot; in their triads.</p><p>Even if I absolutely hated vibrato and beating, I think my ideal intervals<br/>(ignoring considerations of how they connect with one another) would be just<br/>a fraction of a cent off just, so that the overtones wouldn&apos;t be<br/>phase-locked but would &quot;flange&quot; a bit. This is the kind of quality you get<br/>with exceptionally good vocal ensembles.</p></div><h3><a id=11601 href="#11601">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2000 9:01:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Absolutely -- the immediate reaction of most Western musicians, after 150<br/>&gt;years of 12-tET hegemony, to triads with just thirds is usually that they<br/>&gt;sound &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;lifeless&quot;.</p><p>Paul- what is your source on this?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=11620 href="#11620">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2000 8:34:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Absolutely -- the immediate reaction of most Western musicians, after 150<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;years of 12-tET hegemony, to triads with just thirds is usually that they<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;sound &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;lifeless&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Paul- what is your source on this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Lots of reading and anecdotal experience (testing other musicians and<br/>&gt;myself).
