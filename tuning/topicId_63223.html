The most practical solution seems to be to get the<br/>&gt; pitches you want on a string or electronically and then, through<br/>much<br/>&gt; trial and error, get the wind instrument to match those pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@o...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rami,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; First allow me to correct a mistake, the Nay or Ney is not just an<br/>&gt; Arabic<br/>&gt; &gt; wind instrument, it&apos;s a wind instrument of Maqam Music, which is a<br/>&gt; &gt; trans-national genre encompassing all boundaries from North Africa<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; Balkans and Transaxonia, including Turkey, Persia and Arab<br/>&gt; countries like<br/>&gt; &gt; Egypt, Morocco, Syria, Iraq, etc...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Secondly, the Physical laws are not very much delineated I&apos;m<br/>&gt; afraid. There<br/>&gt; &gt; is much contraversy regarding how the holes should be opened. We<br/>&gt; Turks have<br/>&gt; &gt; formulated the matter as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Divide the lenght of the Ney into 26 equal portions and assign<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the hole for Dugah at 26/4<br/>&gt; &gt; Kurdi at 26/5<br/>&gt; &gt; Segah at 26/6<br/>&gt; &gt; Chargah at 26/8<br/>&gt; &gt; Hicaz-Saba at 26/9<br/>&gt; &gt; Neva at 26/10<br/>&gt; &gt; and Acem in the back at 26/13<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The fact that the hole in the middle does not give the octave of<br/>&gt; perde Rast<br/>&gt; &gt; (whose relative frequency is always 1/1 regardless of the<br/>&gt; Ahenk=Diapason) is<br/>&gt; &gt; due to the double open-ended nature of Ney, which causes the<br/>&gt; wavelenght to<br/>&gt; &gt; increase as much as 0.613 times the lenght of the instrument, or<br/>so<br/>&gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; say.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In any case, we have these relative frequencies by default, if it<br/>&gt; the matter<br/>&gt; &gt; was equal divisions on a string:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rast 1 (0 cents)<br/>&gt; &gt; Dugah 26/22 = 1.181818182 = 289.21 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; Kurdi  26/21 = 1.238095238 = 369.75 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; Segah 26/20 = 1.3 = 454.214 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; Chargah 26/18 = 1.444444444 = 636.618 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; Hicaz 26/17 = 1.529411765 = 735.572 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; Neva 26/16 = 1.625 = 840.528 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; Acem 26/13 = 2 = 1200 cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, this table is not correct with the Ney, because the<br/>actual<br/>&gt; values<br/>&gt; &gt; are expected to become:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rast 1<br/>&gt; &gt; Dugah 9/8<br/>&gt; &gt; Kurdi 13/11 to 6/5 (by bending and embouchure)<br/>&gt; &gt; Segah 27/22 to 5/4 (by bending and embouchure)<br/>&gt; &gt; Chargah 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt; Hijaz 10/7 to 7/5 (by bending and embouchure)<br/>&gt; &gt; Neva 3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; Acem 16/9<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe some gentle fellow, like Paul Erlich, will come and explain<br/>&gt; what&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; going on with these numbers.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt; &gt; Ozan Yarman<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=63313 href="#63313">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2006 2:06:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>And what would be his address dare I ask?</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 03 Ocak 2006 Sal&iuml;&iquest;&half; 23:56<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Making a Nay</p><p>If it&apos;s a starting point from which one can ultimately coax the holes<br/>to give the pitches you want, then I&apos;m all for it.
