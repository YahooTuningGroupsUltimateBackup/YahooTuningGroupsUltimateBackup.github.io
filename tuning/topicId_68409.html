It allows individual tuning of each scale step (in cents<br/>above or below ET), and it offers 75 preset scales. I had a quick<br/>look, and those presets cover every 12-note scale I&apos;ve ever heard of<br/>(and a lot that I haven&apos;t).</p><p>The website is <a href="http://synthfont.com">http://synthfont.com</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Patrick</p></div>
