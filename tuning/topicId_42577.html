In addition to a few rehearsals for John Eaton&apos;s new polymicrotonal<br/>work &quot;Vespers,&quot; I coached the professional Aguava chorale in Henk Badings&apos;<br/>31-tET &quot;Contrasten.&quot;</p><p>I gave a microtonally-tinged presentation on the Ives &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; for<br/>the President of the American Musicological Society&apos;s 20th Century Music<br/>class.  Also, I had conferences with P.Q. Phun (Viet-Nam) and Sven-David<br/>Sandstrom (Sweden) who plan to use AFMM performances for their classes.  Both<br/>are microtonal composers for many years (though a bit stuck on quartertones,<br/>admittedly to all).</p><p>Additionally, I gave presentations on early music tunings and temperaments to<br/>the top flight vocalists, and later to the doctoral choral composers.  At one<br/>time, I was asked by the chair of the department to list the cents values for<br/>Ab Major in Werckmeister III so to teach it vocally, without the use of a<br/>harpsichord (or machine).  It went rather well.  Students had individual<br/>Werckmeister problems, one of which I need further study (involving Leipzig&apos;s<br/>chor and kammer pitch relationships in the &quot;St. Matthew&apos;s Passion&quot;).</p><p>Did I mention they have a new organ which plays in both Werckmeister III and<br/>meantone?  They are already planning the big Bach work.</p><p>In 5 days there were 3 parties of mixed personages.  And they have a great<br/>sushi restaurant outside their fantastic library.  The head librarian kindly<br/>took out rare books in his own name for me to study and duplicate.<br/>Musicologist George Buelow (author of the &quot;Werckmeister&quot; essay in the Grove<br/>Dictionary), and composer Cary Boyce (performing in NYC on 3/22/03), all<br/>shared Chinese food.  The 73-year old musicologist jogged his memory for how<br/>he came to his conclusions, where he had traveled in Germany, and what kind<br/>of receptions he received.  (He was ignored...&quot;too ahead of its time,&quot; he<br/>said.)</p><p>Most successful recordings: Ives &quot;Unanswered Question&quot; in extended<br/>Pythagorean, Buxtehude in Werckmeister III, Dowland in Dowland&apos;s Irregular<br/>(performed by Wim Hoogewerf), and my piece Dune for bassoon.</p><p>Great discussions (George Martin was a bassoonist (re Beatles) and<br/>definitions of folk music....arghh!?!) were discussed.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Mats &#xD6;ljare   oljare@hotmail.com &#x3C;oljare@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2003 3:06:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I gave a microtonally-tinged presentation on the Ives &quot;Universe<br/>Symphony&quot; for<br/>&gt; the President of the American Musicological Society&apos;s 20th Century<br/>Music<br/>&gt; class.
