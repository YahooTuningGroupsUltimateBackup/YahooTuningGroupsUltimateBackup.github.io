Some of you may know their<br/>recordings, or about their instruments from Bart Hopkin&apos;s recent book -<br/>&apos;Orbitones, Spoonharps and Bellowphones&apos;.</p><p>UAKTI don&apos;t specialise in alternative tunings, but they DO perform<br/>almost exclusively on instruments built by one of their members - Marco<br/>Antonio Guimaraes.  If I have the figures correct, Marco has been<br/>building instruments for over 30 years, and has built over 300 new<br/>instrunents.  A significant portion of these really are NEW, or at least<br/>have highly original features - which was to me was really astonishing.</p><p>I was picked up at the airport by Artur Andres Ribeiro who is the only<br/>member of the group who &apos;normally&apos; plays a conventional instrument (the<br/>flute) within the ensemble, but even this has been modified.  Artur&apos;s<br/>flute has a specially cut, large extra hole in the headjoint which is<br/>covered with fine polythene held relatively taut over the hole (closing<br/>it).  This gives the flute a slightly buzzy Indian timbre (similar in<br/>principle to some Eastern woodwinds, such as the &apos;Taegum&apos;).</p><p>(A Swiss flautist, Matthias Zeigler, who unfortunately I did not manage<br/>to meet on the trip, also plays a conventional flute which is modified<br/>in a similar way. In Zeigler&apos;s case, I understand he has a key which<br/>opens and closes a cap over the polythene (or fish-skin, in the case of<br/>the Taegum), so that the buzz effect can be turned on and off. I<br/>understand that Zeigler may also have tried to patent this idea).</p><p>I cannot possibly describe all of Marco&apos;s instruments here. Amongst them<br/>were:</p><p>- the &apos;Pius-Pi&apos; - a set of bird-calls set together in a wooden holder,<br/>with adjacent rubber-bicycle-horn-bulbs which can be pressed as if they<br/>were a typewriter keyboard...;</p><p>- the &apos;Taquara&apos;, an extremely simple but beautifully effective kind of<br/>bamboo mouth-organ;</p><p>- various percussion instruments using plastic tubing of varying length<br/>mounted in stands - &apos;Trilobita&apos;, &apos;Grande Pan&apos;, &apos;Pan Inclinado&apos; - some<br/>with open tubes, others with skins stretched accross the open ends of<br/>the tubes.  The non-struck end of the tubes have small plastic inserts<br/>which can be used to slightly vary (perhaps from one peice to another)<br/>the pitch that each tube sounds;</p><p>- a &apos;Chori&apos; - a cello in which the body of the instrument is a gourd;</p><p>- a glass marimba;</p><p>- a special &apos;berimbau&apos; with three strings and a special key for pitch<br/>changes;</p><p>- a &apos;guitar&apos; played using a piano-type keyboard arrangment;</p><p>- a multi-movement percussion intrument, in which each movemnenbt in<br/>different direction effects an individual sound;</p><p>and many, many others...</p><p>These instruments were not &apos;central&apos; to my research into developments of<br/>the orchestral mainstream, but throughout the trip, more and more I<br/>found myself fascinated and moved by alternative instruments - as well<br/>as always being aware of how one &apos;technology&apos; may lead to another - and<br/>how one design may &apos;interact&apos; with another...</p><p>What is also extraordinary about UAKTI - aside from the sheer prolific<br/>invention of Marco&apos;s instrument making - is that each of the four<br/>members of the group has a virtuosic skill on many of these new<br/>instruments...</p><p>See:</p><p><a href="http://culturabrasil.art.br/uakti/index.html">http://culturabrasil.art.br/uakti/index.html</a></p><p>and practice your Portuguese...<br/>--<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low,<br/><a href="http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a><br/>mailto: <a href="mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a></p></div>
