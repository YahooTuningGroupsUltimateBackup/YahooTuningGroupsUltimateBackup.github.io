It all confirms<br/>my view that the maximally even and tetrachordal scales go together, in a<br/>crazy sort of way.  Between the two, you get 8 modes with identical<br/>tetrachords, by Paul&apos;s counting.  Although I don&apos;t see where the 8th comes<br/>from, as each tetrachordal neutral scale is the anti-scale of a tetrachordal<br/>diatonic scale.  The process is as follows:</p><p>      1) First, catch your tetrachords!</p><p>      2) The two tetrachords are divided by a whole tone.<br/>         Keep it as a major tone.</p><p>      3) Each tetrachord has three seconds in it.<br/>         Swap every major second for a neutral second,<br/>         and every minor second for a major second.</p><p>By this process, the maximally even scale is the average of Ionian and<br/>Phrygian, or is anti-Dorian.</p><p>Right, that&apos;s all for today.</p><p>                            Graham<br/>              <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/tuning.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/tuning.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=3833 href="#3833">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/30/1999 8:03:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Nachricht geschrieben von <a href="mailto:INTERNET:tuning@onelist.com">INTERNET:tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>I expect I&apos;m duplicating Erv Wilson&apos;s work here (or someone&apos;s?).

We lose the near-Just 2:3&apos;s and 4:5&apos;s, but in the previous version<br/>the perfect triads just seemed to accentuate how bad the tetrads were.</p><p>Putting it in 19-tET also cuts down the number of different intervals from<br/>20 to 18.</p><p>The diesis-pump chord progression G#,B,D,F,Ab,G# is interesting, but<br/>maddening to play on a standard keyboard, even with the keys labelled<br/>(according to the mapping I gave earlier).</p><p>In addition to the consonant intervals shown on the earlier lattice, there<br/>are four 5:9&apos;s (7c flat), G#:F#, B:A, D:C, F:Eb, and three 7:9&apos;s (7c sharp)<br/>B:Eb, Eb:G#, G#:C. Two pairs of these combine to give two 5:6:7:9<br/>half-diminished 7th chords, D:F:G#:C, F:Ab:B:Eb.</p><p>It&apos;s a pity it&apos;s so far from proper.</p><p>Paul E., are there any modes of this scale that fulfil your generalised<br/>diatonic criteria if modified to allow minor-thirds to take over the role<br/>of fifths for chord-progression purposes?

I used diatonic notation<br/>because it&apos;s familiar. Since there are many diatonic chords, why shouldn&apos;t<br/>they have diatonic notation? Although, in effect, it _is_ a 7 nominal + 4<br/>accidentals notation. Ab, Cb, E#, G# may be considered nominals since there<br/>is no A, C, E, or G (or their other flats or sharps).</p><p>In general I don&apos;t like using degree numbers because they change when you<br/>change the number of tones in the chain.</p><p>&gt;Speaking of the 8-tone subsets of this scale... they are proper, and due<br/>&gt;to Rothenberg and Miller&apos;s results, might they be heard even when the 11-<br/>&gt;tone superset is desired?</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with these results. Can you give me a URL?</p><p>That&apos;s interesting that 8 tones is proper. I hadn&apos;t imagined there were any<br/>proper chains between 4 and 15 tones exclusive. 4 and 15 are strictly<br/>proper and have only two step sizes. I&apos;ve checked them all with Scala now.<br/>8 tones is proper but it has 3 step sizes (and so does not have Myhill&apos;s<br/>property and is not a MOS). In that range, only 7 and 11 have 2 step sizes.<br/>Any length chain (of anything) will have symmetry, so since 2, 3, 4, 7, 11,<br/>15 and 19 (minor 3rds) have 2 step sizes they are also MOS&apos;s. They also<br/>have Myhill&apos;s property.</p><p>Consideration of meantone chains leads me to think that having 2 step sizes<br/>is more important than propriety, since 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 of meantone are<br/>all proper, but of these, only 5, 7 and 12 have only 2 step sizes (+<br/>Myhill&apos;s + MOS). Although they are also the only ones that are strictly<br/>proper.</p><p>&gt;What are the harmonic characteristics of the 8-tone<br/>&gt;subset?  Scala file is attached.</p><p>Well, for every tone you drop, you lose a utonal and otonal tetrad, so<br/>going from 11 down to 8 tones you go from 10 down to 4 tetrads. If you&apos;re<br/>only interested in 5-limit it&apos;s the same; from 10 down to 4 triads. But<br/>it&apos;s better than 7 tones with only two (one major and one minor).</p><p>&gt;In the legend of your lattice diagram, there seems to be an extra blue<br/>&gt;line between 4 and 9?</p><p>Yes, there are no 4:9&apos;s in an 11 tone chain of m3&apos;s. One would have to go<br/>to 13 or more tones. But you will see it used in the 9-limit lattice for<br/>diatonic, at the end of the article.</p><p>In this case there are no 4:9&apos;s because there is no chain of two fifths,<br/>but in general for temperaments we may have consecutive fifths with<br/>acceptable errors but they may add up to an unacceptable error in the 4:9.</p><p>&gt;How can the error go from 18 cents to 21.5 cents when the generator goes<br/>&gt;from 6/5 to 315.789?  In the 7:4 you say?  The difference is only 3 *<br/>&gt;0.1485.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to make this clearer. Thanks. It goes from 18c to 21.5c when the<br/>generator goes from 316.99 (1/6-kleisma, the one with the lowest highest<br/>absolute error) to 315.79 (19-tET).</p><p>&gt;&gt;That is, it has only two step sizes and has reflective symmetry (about D<br/>&gt;in &gt;the notation below).

I used diatonic notation<br/>&gt;because it&apos;s familiar. Since there are many diatonic chords, why shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;they have diatonic notation? Although, in effect, it _is_ a 7 nominal + 4<br/>&gt;accidentals notation. Ab, Cb, E#, G# may be considered nominals since there<br/>&gt;is no A, C, E, or G (or their other flats or sharps).</p><p>No I didn&apos;t make a case, I asked.  However.  I find this &apos;familiar&apos; stuff<br/>to be way over-rated.  Composing in this scale will be the challenge.<br/>Finding structures --- took 500 years to get where we are with the diatonic<br/>scale.  That&apos;s a huge challenge.  To get the chords under your fingers on<br/>your instrument.  That&apos;s a huge challenge.  To learn a new notation is<br/>absolutely trivial.  The skills of sight reading are not revoked by<br/>changing the number of nominal symbols in the notation.  It&apos;s a 2-hour<br/>matter of flash cards to learn the notes names on the staff.  Observe what<br/>happened when Easley Blackwood made retention of diatonic notation a<br/>priority.  He wound up with the most obtuse and hard-to-read notation I can<br/>imagine.  His decatonic scale is a piece of cake, for example, with ten<br/>nominals and one octave to a conventional 5-line staff.  The chords pop<br/>out, the key signatures are a sinch, and melodic motion is intuitive.</p><p>The 7-fifths semitone exists in your ear, but not in this scale.  By using<br/>7 nominals, you reinforce it in the compositional framwork of the scale.  I<br/>suggested 4, 8, and 11 because they represent places where the chain gets<br/>close to closing against the octave, just as 5 and 7 fifths almost close<br/>around the octave.</p><p>&gt;In general I don&apos;t like using degree numbers because they change when you<br/>&gt;change the number of tones in the chain.</p><p>You&apos;re using them, tho?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Speaking of the 8-tone subsets of this scale... they are proper, and due<br/>&gt;&gt;to Rothenberg and Miller&apos;s results, might they be heard even when the 11-<br/>&gt;&gt;tone superset is desired?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not familiar with these results.  Can you give me a URL?</p><p>Miller wrote a paper on short-term memory which has become a classic of<br/>cognitive psychology, and has been discussed before on this list...</p><p><a href="http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html">http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html</a></p><p>As far as Rothenberg goes, I just meant that the 11-tone chain is not<br/>proper, while the 8-tone chain is.</p><p>&gt;Consideration of meantone chains leads me to think that having 2 step sizes<br/>&gt;is more important than propriety, since 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 of meantone are<br/>&gt;all proper, but of these, only 5, 7 and 12 have only 2 step sizes (+<br/>&gt;Myhill&apos;s + MOS). Although they are also the only ones that are strictly<br/>&gt;proper.</p><p>Rothenberg was able to explain the selection of 5 and 7 using only two<br/>measures: stability and efficiency.  Stability is essentially the<br/>percentage of the scale&apos;s intervals which are &quot;ambiguous&quot;, that is, which<br/>appear in more than one interval class.  For a definition of efficiency,<br/>see TD #52 and 55.  What I like about Rothenberg&apos;s stuff is that he came up<br/>with it first, actually for a speech recognition model, and then applied it<br/>to music and got results that jived.</p><p>&gt;Well, for every tone you drop, you lose a utonal and otonal tetrad, so<br/>&gt;going from 11 down to 8 tones you go from 10 down to 4 tetrads. If you&apos;re<br/>&gt;only interested in 5-limit it&apos;s the same; from 10 down to 4 triads. But<br/>&gt;it&apos;s better than 7 tones with only two (one major and one minor).</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>&gt;&gt;In the legend of your lattice diagram, there seems to be an extra blue<br/>&gt;&gt;line between 4 and 9?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, there are no 4:9&apos;s in an 11 tone chain of m3&apos;s. One would have to go<br/>&gt;to 13 or more tones. But you will see it used in the 9-limit lattice for<br/>&gt;diatonic, at the end of the article.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In this case there are no 4:9&apos;s because there is no chain of two fifths,<br/>&gt;but in general for temperaments we may have consecutive fifths with<br/>&gt;acceptable errors but they may add up to an unacceptable error in the 4:9.</p><p>Oh wait- there&apos;s not an extra line, you&apos;ve just bent the 4:9 so it&apos;s<br/>distinct from 4:6 and the 6:9?</p><p>&gt;&gt;How can the error go from 18 cents to 21.5 cents when the generator goes<br/>&gt;&gt;from 6/5 to 315.789?  In the 7:4 you say?  The difference is only 3 *<br/>&gt;&gt;0.1485.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;ll have to make this clearer. Thanks. It goes from 18c to 21.5c when the<br/>&gt;generator goes from 316.99 (1/6-kleisma, the one with the lowest highest<br/>&gt;absolute error) to 315.79 (19-tET).</p><p>Ah-ha.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;That is, it has only two step sizes and has reflective symmetry (about D<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;in the notation below).
