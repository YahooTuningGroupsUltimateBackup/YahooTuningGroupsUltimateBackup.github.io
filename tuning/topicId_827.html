I do have a few questions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Did you have any problems with frets being a bit too high (or low) and<br/>&gt; &gt;causing buzz?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I got a slight buzz on one fret so far. I raised the bridge a little. I<br/>&gt; also filed down the fret a bit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;How well to they stay on?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The one I was filing popped off but I simply glued it on a little better.<br/>&gt; That was the only one so far. I&apos;ve been using 5 minute epoxy. I suppose you<br/>&gt; could use the 30 minute stuff which is stronger, but I haven&apos;t neeeded to<br/>&gt; yet. I kinda want to leave it only semi-permanent at this point in case I<br/>&gt; decide to change the scale or the tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Is the wire you used the same height as if you used regular fret wire?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Its about the same but of course is circular so it seems a tad higher.<br/>&gt; Filing them a bit flat would make them more like a normal fret.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Do you maintain the CGCGCG tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far, yes. I&apos;m a little worried about lack of variety in fingering<br/>&gt; possibilities due to there being only two positions of the scale, but with<br/>&gt; three strings done there seems to be plenty of possible fingerings that<br/>&gt; sound interesting. In a way, I wanted to get as far away as possible from<br/>&gt; standard tuning so that I would have a completely fresh start. And as I<br/>&gt; mentioned, the resonance with this tuning is great.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Which is 1/1?  C or G?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C is 1/1, so , starting from the sixth (lowest) string, it is 1/1, 3/2,<br/>&gt; 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 6/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;What are the intervals found on each string?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 1/1, 2/1, and 4/1 strings have the straight scale. The 3/2, 3/1, and<br/>&gt; 6/1 start at 3/2 so the 1/1 on those strings are in the middle of the<br/>&gt; string, somewhat like on a sitar&apos;s playing string.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;That said, you might consider acquiring a frequency generator and<br/>&gt; &gt;occilloscope so that you may test the frequency of each fret placement with<br/>&gt; &gt;greater accuracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would except my mac will not pick up sound off a microphone, so I cant<br/>&gt; use the various frquency counters, oscilloscopes, etc available on the web.<br/>&gt; Thank god for JIcalc, which I think is all I need (along with my ear) for<br/>&gt; accuracy. The tunings so far seem very exact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; dante<br/>&gt;  p.s Carl, you didn&apos;t miss a picture cause it werent there.

If possible,<br/>get some kind of stick that you can pretend is a guitar neck.  Mark with<br/>pencil the fret locations for the tuning system you wish to investigate.<br/>Move your fingers around and see how it seems to work for you.  You don&apos;t<br/>want to end up with a fretboard that&apos;s too crowded, with frets so close<br/>together that you can&apos;t hit specific ones clearly.  It is also interesting<br/>to hear from different guitarists on the list what kind of spacings they<br/>can work with.  I find that my 22ET strat is quite tight, especially up<br/>past the octave fret, and it is very difficult to play chords.  Other<br/>people are apparently very comfortable with 31, 34, and even 53!  As I have<br/>mentioned before, the distance between the strings seems to be an important<br/>factor too, since it can limit the space to fit your fingertips when<br/>fingering chords.</p><p>As someone who plays both JI and ET guitars, I can definitely say that ET<br/>is simply much easier to work with, although JI can in some ways be more<br/>fun.  Think carefully about what kinds of intervals and chords you want to<br/>be able use and how you want to be able to transpose/modulate them.  Listen<br/>to music in different ET and JI systems (Blackwood, Darreg, McLaren,<br/>Haverstick, Catler, Schneider, etc.)  Listen for specific interesting<br/>melodic/harmonic aspects of the tuning system, and try not to associate the<br/>tuning system specifically with the pieces of music.  (I love 22ET as a<br/>system, but really don&apos;t care for some of the music I have heard in it,<br/>such as Blackwood&apos;s piece.)</p><p>kp</p></div><h3><a id=4233 href="#4233">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I&apos;m curious about the<br/>&gt; interchangeable fretboards. Magnetic? How does this affect sustain,<br/>&gt; tone, etc?</p><p>No.  I rout out pieces of plywood and bolt them on.  Certain temperaments<br/>create a much longer sustain with the reinforcement of the frets, some are<br/>much shorter.  41 equal can go on for like 10 seconds and 45 equal fades<br/>like a xylophone.</p><p>How they affect the tone is, if you tour the physics of the wave on the<br/>string, as it passes over each fret, there&apos;s a certain excited area that<br/>amplifies the wave at that point.  Each fret acts like a minature wall<br/>that&apos;s closer to the source of the string and causes a more rapid echo than<br/>the cavities in between.  What took me about 10 years to realize is this<br/>puts a notch at each fret point, on the way to the nut and on the way back<br/>to the bridge, and there, within the fingerprint of the timbre, is every<br/>note on the guitar fretboard, slightly teased by this sort of &quot;goosebump&quot;<br/>effect.</p><p>In other words, the entire temperament is imbedded in every note you play.<br/>Which makes playing the temperament intuitive and almost native(-able) to<br/>the guitar.  So since the frets are in different places in different<br/>temperaments, you wind up with different reinforcements of these goosebump<br/>wanna-be formants.  So different fretboards sound different on the SAME<br/>GUITAR.</p><p>In an extreme measure, if you fretted a guitar completely at random, the<br/>&quot;tuning&quot; you had created would also be imbedded in each note.   Since every<br/>note you play more or less &quot;modulates&quot; a loop in the previous note, anything<br/>you play can sound logical.</p><p>The quirkier the temperament is harmonically, the more distinct a timbre<br/>it&apos;ll have.  One thing a few people have noted about my CD is that, more<br/>than just whether 32 or 49 are interesting, just how completely DIFFERENT<br/>they sound.</p><p>Marc</p><p>--<br/>Cyberenaissance, Vol. 6 now available<br/>32tET and 49tET guitar suites<br/><a href="http://www.orphonsoul.com">http://www.orphonsoul.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=38935 href="#38935">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2002 9:05:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unstruck&quot; &lt;unstruck@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m responding to a few posts in this email, to avoid bogging down the<br/>&gt; list...</p><p>Given the low volume of late, I wouldn&apos;t worry.</p><p>&gt; Ok, a newbie question: in practice, if I don&apos;t intend on modulating<br/>&gt; through all the keys in one piece, is the non-circular nature of a<br/>&gt; meantone a huge issue?

The wolf fifth, 33.8 cents flat for golden meantone, should also be a little more usable than in the 12-note version. In any case, if you are doing diatonic music you *need* to be in meantone of some kind. If you are interested in 7-limit harmony, golden does pretty well; it&apos;s fifth is only about 3/7 of a cent flatter than an optimal value, and ends up giving you a seventh which is 6 2/3 cents flat; it is also more or less bang-on as optimal for 5-limit.

Each fret acts like a minature wall<br/>&gt; that&apos;s closer to the source of the string and causes a more rapid echo<br/>&gt; than<br/>&gt; the cavities in between.  What took me about 10 years to realize is<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; puts a notch at each fret point, on the way to the nut and on the way<br/>&gt; back<br/>&gt; to the bridge, and there, within the fingerprint of the timbre, is<br/>&gt; every<br/>&gt; note on the guitar fretboard, slightly teased by this sort of<br/>&gt; &quot;goosebump&quot;<br/>&gt; effect.</p><p>That&apos;s really interesting; I never thought that would have a noticeable<br/>effect, although it makes sense, especially for fretted notes, where<br/>the string would be closer to the fretboard.. You&apos;re basically saying<br/>that for each fret, there is a corresponding frequency that is implied<br/>in the timbre (harmonic fingerprint) of the string, right? Like if I<br/>only had frets at the harmonic nodes (of the open string), the<br/>harmonics would be emphasized slightly, and if my guitar is 12tet,<br/>12tet is embedded in the timbre of every note I play. That&apos;s<br/>fascinating. Try that using midi pitch-bend. ;)</p><p>When slotting a new fretboard, do you (or anyone else reading this)<br/>compensate for string tension by moving the frets slightly closer to<br/>the nut (which would be equivalent to moving the nut closer to the<br/>first fret, as in a normal nut compensation)? If so, how much, and<br/>would you compensate all the frets by an equal amount, or differently<br/>across the whole neck (since string tension will be higher for notes<br/>fretted near the nut than in higher positions)?</p><p>Alternatively, could anyone suggest how I might calculate this<br/>compensation? One way would be to determine experimentally the cents<br/>deviation at different locations on the neck in 12tet, and compensate<br/>the new fret slots accordingly (but this won&apos;t work that well if the<br/>old frets aren&apos;t bang-on). Is there a more mathematical way to do it? I<br/>guess I&apos;m thinking of either determining experimental values and<br/>averaging them out, or just moving all the frets 1mm or so closer to<br/>the nut.

It&apos;s<br/>not exactly formants either.  Not sure what to call it.</p><p>It was easy to imagine after awhile that it was something along the lines of<br/>pinching harmonics.  If you fully pinch a harmonic, you hear that harmonic<br/>as a fundamental.  If you partially pinch it, you hear that harmonic<br/>emphasized in the original timbre.</p><p>Try this:  vary the distance of the finger pinching, you can hear different<br/>degrees of influence.  Now imagine what a fret being so close to the string<br/>is doing to it.  Then extend that to the number of frets ALL effecting the<br/>sound at once.  Sure you can pinch a second or third harmonic but try<br/>pinching them both at once.</p><p>As far as the difference between the sound reinforcement of a cavity versus<br/>a fret, drone like &quot;ahhh&quot; and hold your hand a foot away from your mouth.<br/>Then hold it three inches away.  It&apos;s louder.  Amplitude varies with<br/>distance, so the reverberation of the string is quicker nearest the fret.</p><p>I THOUGHT I heard higher frequencies in the timbre.  Anyone can tell<br/>listening, the more frets there are, the brighter the timbre, so you imagine<br/>it&apos;s higher harmonics.  I had a metal fret guitar in 34.  At the point where<br/>I really wanted to play 17, I just removed every other fret.  At one point I<br/>dismantled the guitar and inspected all the electronics because I thought<br/>something happened.  The tone was completely different.</p><p>But.  Imagine GRAPHICALLY morphing a sawtooth wave into a triangle wave.<br/>You could spend lots of time trying to figure out the formula for changing<br/>all the harmonic components over the course of time when, the easiest<br/>dimension to explain the operation in is, you graphically morphed it.</p><p>Similarly you can try to &quot;explain&quot; this whole phenomena in terms of the<br/>interaction of harmonics.  You can try to explain guitar distortion in terms<br/>of harmonics.  If you apply a 5% noise variable to a digital audio clip, you<br/>can try to sample the output and try to reanalyze the harmonics of it etc,<br/>when the operation was actually only throwing in a noise percentage.</p><p>Without getting all into triple integrals and real time equations, here&apos;s a<br/>way to visualize it.</p><p>Ever take a length of rope laid out straight and flick it?  You see the<br/>little bump &quot;move&quot; across it?  This happens when you pluck a guitar string.<br/>That &quot;bump&quot; bounces back and forth between the nut and bridge until the<br/>string flattens itself out again.</p><p>That&apos;s what happens horizontally.  What happens vertically is the wind from<br/>the air pressure hits the fretboard area and bounces back.  At the<br/>fretpoints, the pressure is greater, so as the &quot;bump&quot; moves back over the<br/>string, compared to the payback from the fret cavities, it has more<br/>interference at the fretpoint.  So as the bump moves over, it picks up<br/>&quot;spikes&quot;.</p><p>Over the course of monitoring the signal, the distance between a paticular<br/>spike and it&apos;s reflection, is the wavelength of the note you&apos;d get if you<br/>fretted the string at the fret that caused that spike.  So in a freeze frame<br/>world dragging itself forward, as you play a note, every wavelength has a<br/>way of teasing that it&apos;s going to loop at every note along the way.  So<br/>whatever the next note you play is, there&apos;s that much of a trace in it in<br/>the previous note.</p><p>&gt; Like if I only had frets at the harmonic nodes (of the open string), the<br/>&gt; harmonics would be emphasized slightly, and if my guitar is 12tet, 12tet is<br/>&gt; embedded in the timbre of every note I play.</p><p>It&apos;s more complicated when it comes to a guitar fretted with convex metal<br/>with flat wooden sections in between.  The routing I do leaves a very small<br/>ridge in the wood, with an elliptical concave section in between each pair<br/>of frets.  It&apos;s not perfectly elliptical, somewhere between that and<br/>beveled.</p><p>The ONLY way to really explain this comprehensively involves something I<br/>haven&apos;t really been able to do yet.  You&apos;d have to map the air pressure<br/>around a string.  I&apos;ve wanted to for some time, to see if I could maybe<br/>devise a fine way of routing that would create interesting effects; maybe<br/>purely elliptical, maybe beveled, maybe sinusoidal.</p><p>As a goof, years ago, my first 32 board was cut in RAMPS, like a sawtooth<br/>wave.  At the fretpoint, the wood would drop down and ramp up to the next<br/>note.  It sounded totally different from the 32 board I have now with the<br/>more or less standardized concave spaces.</p><p>For that matter, though, I much prefer playing the 12 tone fretboard I have<br/>carved over any fretted 12 guitar.</p><p>Anyway.  I don&apos;t yet know how to explain it.  The 31 tone fretboard I have<br/>on my Strat copy sounds a lot more, like the 31 tone metal fret Les Paul I<br/>used to have, than it does any other fretboard I put on the Strat.</p><p>In any case, it&apos;s not like I&apos;m putting forth some kind of jerkoff &quot;theory&quot;<br/>that different boards &quot;should&quot; sound different on the same guitar, I&apos;m<br/>speaking from 10 years of having 2 second experiences of musically<br/>illiterate people say they can hear the difference... and just trying to<br/>find a physics based explanation as to why.</p><p>Marc</p><p>--<br/>Cyberenaissance, Vol. 6 now available<br/>microtonal guitar suites<br/>32 and 49 equal notes per octave<br/><a href="http://www.orphonsoul.com">http://www.orphonsoul.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39008 href="#39008">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2002 5:02:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Unstruckji,</p><p>Being a musician, and having spent a year in India, I<br/>knew exactly what your name meant the moment I saw it.<br/> I don&apos;t have vanity license plates, but it may amuse<br/>you to hear that I decided over 20 years ago that if I<br/>ever were to get them, I&apos;d like to get ones that read:<br/>22 SRUTIS!</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know more about Nadaka [One who<br/>works with Nada (Sound)?] and his guitar with moveable<br/>frets.

I can tell you that the<br/>sustain and the volume are both somewhat affected by<br/>the sound-robbing nature of the magnetic rubber sheet<br/>which holds the interchangeable fretboards on the<br/>neck, but that it&apos;s not that big of a loss of<br/>loudness.

What, exactly, are you<br/>&gt; looking for in a<br/>&gt; tuning?<br/>&gt; [End quote]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m looking primarily for two things:<br/>&gt; - 5- and 7-limit harmony better than 12tet. (higher<br/>&gt; than 7 would be a<br/>&gt; bonus but is not a primary consideration at this<br/>&gt; time).<br/>&gt; - playability on the guitar. (i had sort of ruled<br/>&gt; out 31-tet for this<br/>&gt; reason).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been looking at such a variety simply because<br/>&gt; this is all quite<br/>&gt; new to me. I&apos;m used to thinking in terms of JI, but<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not very<br/>&gt; familiar with all the properties of various et&apos;s,<br/>&gt; mt&apos;s, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Genewardsmith]<br/>&gt; &gt; Can anyone think of any reasons not to do this,<br/>&gt; any serious drawbacks<br/>&gt; &gt; of golden meantone?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously, it doesn&apos;t close into an equal<br/>&gt; temperament. In practice, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see why a golden meantone of 19 tones would<br/>&gt; have any special<br/>&gt; property, but it&apos;s an excellent meantone, near the<br/>&gt; Woolhouse.<br/>&gt; [end quote]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, a newbie question: in practice, if I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; intend on modulating<br/>&gt; through all the keys in one piece, is the<br/>&gt; non-circular nature of a<br/>&gt; meantone a huge issue? If my music tends towards<br/>&gt; being diatonic, is it<br/>&gt; still going to be a serious drawback? I don&apos;t see<br/>&gt; why, but I could<br/>&gt; definitely be missing something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With 19 tones, the whole thing is symmetrical, and<br/>&gt; &quot;contains&quot; a 12-tone<br/>&gt; phi-scale, which &quot;contains&quot; a 7-tone phi-scale which<br/>&gt; contains a<br/>&gt; phi-pentatonic, each is embedded one inside the<br/>&gt; other. The next level<br/>&gt; of symmetry appears to be 31 tones. If I continue<br/>&gt; adding frets after<br/>&gt; 19, they start to get really close together, which<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to avoid.<br/>&gt; See<br/>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.elvenminstrel.com/music/tuning/horagrams/horagram04.htm">http://www.elvenminstrel.com/music/tuning/horagrams/horagram04.htm</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; for the special property of 5, 7, 12, 19, 31 tone<br/>&gt; gmt&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Graham]<br/>&gt; Since doing the refretting, I&apos;ve become more<br/>&gt; interested in 11-limit<br/>&gt; harmony.  So I play the guitar as if it were<br/>&gt; 31-equal.  It would have<br/>&gt; worked better if it really were a subset 31-equal.<br/>&gt; If you aren&apos;t sure<br/>&gt; what you want I suggest you choose a tuning more<br/>&gt; 31-ish.  If you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; end<br/>&gt; up using the higher prime approximations, there&apos;s no<br/>&gt; loss.  But if they<br/>&gt; do<br/>&gt; interest you they will sound a lot cleaner in 31.<br/>&gt; The small spacings<br/>&gt; don&apos;t get too small, although some chords become<br/>&gt; unplayable.<br/>&gt; [end quote]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I were doing a bass or a baritone guitar I would<br/>&gt; be more apt to try<br/>&gt; 31eq. But I will definitely look at some subsets of<br/>&gt; this scale. Could<br/>&gt; you suggest some tunings that are &quot;more 31-ish&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Graham]<br/>&gt; There are non-meantones that will work as well, but<br/>&gt; not with<br/>&gt; traditional<br/>&gt; music.  I think a 19-note meantone is a good<br/>&gt; fretting if you don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; leave diatonic music.<br/>&gt; [end quote]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s basically what I have in mind, for starters<br/>&gt; at least. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; basically thinking of a &quot;gateway drug&quot; for<br/>&gt; microtonal music. I&apos;d like<br/>&gt; to be able to play traditional music (blues, jazz,<br/>&gt; carnatic, reggae,<br/>&gt; etc.) with more pleasant intonation than 12tet, as<br/>&gt; well as introduce<br/>&gt; 7-limit harmony into my sonic pallet. I want a<br/>&gt; reasonably playable<br/>&gt; 7-limit guitar. I don&apos;t hear 11-limit inwardly yet.<br/>&gt; I can hear the<br/>&gt; consonance of those intervals if I play them, but I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t tend to hear<br/>&gt; them in my head and heart like I do 5- and 7-limit<br/>&gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Graham]<br/>&gt; The best options are movable frets or<br/>&gt; interchangeable fretboards, but<br/>&gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not up on the practicalities of those.<br/>&gt; [end quote]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I originally thought I wanted. Moveable<br/>&gt; frets would be<br/>&gt; ideal. Nadaka has a guitar with moveable frets; the<br/>&gt; fretboard is cut<br/>&gt; into sections which are mounted on the neck along<br/>&gt; two parallel dovetail<br/>&gt; slots, I think. That seemed a little bit too<br/>&gt; elaborate for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Marc]<br/>&gt; What I would suggest, though, after making a lot of<br/>&gt; dedicated<br/>&gt; temperament<br/>&gt; guitars or interchangeable fretboards at whim... do<br/>&gt; just that.  If you<br/>&gt; want<br/>&gt; to do it, do it.  If you think you want to do it,<br/>&gt; don&apos;t ask anyone if<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; should or shouldn&apos;t.  If you think to do it, do it.<br/>&gt; [end quote]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hear ya... make the Ideal Real, Now. I&apos;m curious<br/>&gt; about the<br/>&gt; interchangeable fretboards. Magnetic?
