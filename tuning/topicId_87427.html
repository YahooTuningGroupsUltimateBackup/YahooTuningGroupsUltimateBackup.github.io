But you made some mistake here, to&nbsp;&nbsp;sound &quot;like Beethoven intended&quot; does not need to have notes close to 12TET, in fact the farther they are off, the better the musical feeling. Traditional &quot;rules&quot; in harmony discouraged &quot;parallel octaves&quot; and the like to make way for this.<br/>Here you are, attached. To simplify the comparison, I put the tuned channels to tracks 5, 6, 7, 8. The original tracks are 1, 2, 3, 4. &nbsp;I use both the &quot;solo&quot; and &quot;mute&quot; buttons to quickly switch between the tuned and un-tuned tracks. You can put whatever samples to test them, I suggest strings, solo or ensemble, it will sound more like it. Many of the notes are tuned to the open strings. BTW he scale used is already &nbsp;inside the scales archive!<br/>To prevent conflicts and to ease viewing, with software I move all same channel events inside a same track. I had different problems with my 3 softwares each with its own peculiarities, in particular, do not put notes in track &quot;0&quot;. This file fixed all errors.<br/>Also, I am still struggling with Scala, I cannot see the global fine tuning command after setting &quot;SET FREQUENCY 440.0 9&quot;. The retune&apos;d file therefore has A not = 440.0, all but C is tuned to the standard frequency.<br/>Other problems I find with Scala -&nbsp;cannot make a midi file from .seq filecannot show pitchwheel events in seq file converted from mid file, there is an error message like &quot;the file is already tuned, no pitchwheel command will be added&quot;, and no pitchwheel messages appeared in the output seq file. But re-tuning a midi file is ok.<br/>Regards,violinissimo, or Linus Liu</p></div><h3><a id=87428 href="#87428">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2010 11:12:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Linus Liu &lt;cflliu@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Also, I am still struggling with Scala, I cannot see the global fine tuning command after setting &quot;SET FREQUENCY 440.0 9&quot;.
