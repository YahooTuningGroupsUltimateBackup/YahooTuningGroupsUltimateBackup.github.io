The player puts the two<br/>&gt; reeds in his mouth, circular breathes, and mostly trills rhythmically<br/>&gt; on one while holding a drone on the other. They can also insert an<br/>&gt; &quot;extender&quot; into one of them which doubles the length of the tube,<br/>&gt; moving the drone down an octave. Although this aspect of the natural 2/1<br/>&gt; is JI, I don&apos;t think the rest is.</p><p>There is a beautiful recording of someone from Sardinia playing these (or<br/>something similar) on Secret Museum of the World, Volume 1, track 2.
