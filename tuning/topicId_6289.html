And anyway, the anomalies are so brief that<br/>they provide a nice &quot;wake-up call&quot; and I like that sort of intensity. Now I<br/>think I did hear a note or two early on in the piece that were/was a<br/>semitone off, but I don&apos;t know the piece well enough to say fer sher. And<br/>it&apos;s true, my patience is not in the area of studying these examples all<br/>that meticulously, though I admire those who do. It&apos;s all to the good, somehow.<br/>As to the most just tuning for a given kind of music or for music in<br/>general, I&apos;m pretty flexible. I like authenticity when we can have it, but I<br/>also like the idea that these differences in tuning are rather like<br/>different seasonings and, if applied with taste, do more good than harm. At<br/>this point in time my main concern is to find ways of opening the ears of<br/>_allll those Rollos out there to the joys of other-than-equal temperament.<br/>One thing I _do know, I with I could bring into reality the performance of<br/>Machaut&apos;s &quot;Messe de Notre Dame&quot; as it sounded in a long-ago dream. It was<br/>via a buncha wax cylinders made in the 1300&apos;s by HIMSELF conducting. The<br/>Pythagorean 3rds and 6ths were astounding.</p></div>
