I always thought that any three<br/>connected tones of a hexany formed some sort of consonant structure.  I<br/>read on page 117 that &quot;in the hexagram or octahedral representation, the<br/>three tone sets appear as triangular faces or facets. The triads of<br/>(diagram) 6-21 are tabulated in (table) 6-22.&quot; Table 6-22 gives 1.5<br/>3.5  5.7 as one of the &quot;essential consonant chords of the hexany&quot;,<br/>namely the 1 3 7. But in the diagram these three tones are not fully<br/>connected. In fact four out of the eight chords listed are not fully<br/>connected.</p><p>I&apos;ve read the chapter inside out and upside down without understanding<br/>what I&apos;m missing. Any help would be most appreciated.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2002 12:29:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Table 6-22 gives 1.5<br/>&gt; 3.5  5.7 as one of the &quot;essential consonant chords of the hexany&quot;,<br/>&gt; namely the 1 3 7.

Or perhaps it shows utonalities as connected, as you read it, at least, but not otonalities? What does it show for 7/5-21/5-7, 1/5-1-7/5 or<br/>1/5-3-21/5?</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2002 12:32:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It should be connected; maybe the diagram just doesn&apos;t show it?
