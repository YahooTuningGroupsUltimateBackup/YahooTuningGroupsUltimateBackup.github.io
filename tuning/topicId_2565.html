I was responding to a post from Graham Breed in which he (I<br/>&gt;think) is advocating a fixed number of pitches per octave, in meantone.</p><p>Hmm, so what am I advocating?  My position is this:</p><p>I am interested in adaptive tuning, and have been for a relatively long<br/>time.  However, the closer I got to implementing it, the less relevant it<br/>seemed to what I wanted to do musically.  As a result, I never got round to<br/>it.</p><p>I&apos;m not much interested in unfettered modulation, so 12 notes per octave<br/>meantone is good enough for me for 5-limit diatonic music.  Adaptive JI<br/>offers (arguably) better tuning, but makes nothing possible that wasn&apos;t<br/>before.  However, it would mean that a lot of 7-limit chords wouldn&apos;t be<br/>recognised as such.  I&apos;d rather know where the 7-limit intervals are than<br/>have everything approximated to the 5-limit.  I think 7-limit intervals are<br/>too ambiguous for adaptive tuning to work with them with 12 notes to the<br/>octave.</p><p>I have also tried more than 12 notes per octave.  Firstly, my guitar has<br/>around 19 frets to the octave[1], with a meantone tuning.  Also, I have<br/>played in 29-note schismic and 19-note meantone on keyboards.  7-limit<br/>adaptive tuning would work with either of these mappings, however the static<br/>tunings work well enough.  Also, I don&apos;t have ideal MIDI controllers for<br/>them (or 22) so I prefer the convenience of 12 note keyboard scales.</p><p>Plus I&apos;ve tried some 12-note well temperaments which offer real<br/>possibilities *to me* for 5-limit oriented music.  Most every chord is<br/>different, so chord changes and modulation really have a *meaning*.  I feel<br/>there&apos;s more musical freedom in this than having every chord modified to<br/>sound the same.  And then there are a lot of tunings that an adaptive<br/>algorithm couldn&apos;t hope to reproduce, including neutral-third scales that I<br/>may mention again today[2].</p><p>Still, there are possibilities in adaptive tuning.  I got JI Relay working<br/>over the weekend, and it does give qualitatively better results than<br/>12-equal, with presumably the same range of modulation.  I got some<br/>&quot;interesting&quot; intervals by breaking the diatonic rules, but I haven&apos;t worked<br/>out how to control them.  For some people this will be ideal, but it&apos;s<br/>largely an irrelevance for me at the moment.  However, I am interested, and<br/>may apply my own algorithms now that somebody else has done the hard work.<br/>I&apos;m particularly interested in using more than 12 notes to the octave.</p><p>     Peace, etc</p><p>                    Graham<br/>         <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/</a></p><p>[1] I know exactly how many frets per octave my guitar has, but it depends<br/>on which octave you look at.</p><p>[2] In case I don&apos;t get around to this, I point the interested reader to<br/>this page on my website: <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/notakey.htm#3plus4">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/notakey.htm#3plus4</a> .<br/>The uninterested reader can happily ignore it.</p></div>
