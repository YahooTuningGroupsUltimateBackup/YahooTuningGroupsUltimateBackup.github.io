That &quot;problem&quot; was encoded into the music in as<br/>much as I would play to the strengths of what I felt &quot;worked&quot;; it<br/>would be difficult to understate the importance of context and<br/>intent... of what it is that your trying to accomplish. I could never<br/>compose a &quot;better&quot; solo guitar piece than I could improvise, but<br/>there&apos;s also no way that I would expect any of my groups to improvise<br/>one of my compositions -- if you want a three measure rhythmic unison<br/>across seven instruments, free-improvisation might not be the best<br/>tactical approach to solving this problem!</p><p>I cherish both through composition and total improvisation. But aside<br/>from hopefully being good music &lt;!&gt;, I don&apos;t expect each to be able to<br/>be the other.</p><p>I intentionally had my fretless Les Paul made without fret markers or<br/>neck dots. I did this not so much because I wanted to &quot;better&quot; my<br/>ear&apos;s ability to play &quot;in tune&quot;... but because I wanted all the<br/>&quot;forbidden&quot; notes right there before me with as few inhibitors as<br/>possible. I wanted to know what the hell was in there motifically...<br/>emotionally... what strange and refracting lines and chords! It takes<br/>a lot of doing and concentration to play the fretless to orthodox<br/>expectations, i.e., conventionally. For a long time I wasn&apos;t the least<br/>bit interested in meeting expectations and aural conventions or any of<br/>it -- I wanted *new notes* and lots of &apos;em damn it!</p><p>My friend Bart Mallio studied with Anthony Braxton for a while; Bart<br/>plays bass in the Anthony Rodrigues Trio in which I also play fretless<br/>guitar. Should anyone be interested, here&apos;s a link to &quot;Long Hard<br/>Winter&quot; by the AR trio:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/55/117_west_great_western.html">http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/55/117_west_great_western.html</a>&gt;</p><p>I think Braxton is a truly remarkable man. He has continually worked<br/>his music towards an organic, unified amalgamation of improvised and<br/>notated schemes. He&apos;s also the type that has no problem seeing the<br/>iconoclastic and remarkable individual achievement across any of the<br/>ideological battlelines that often churn around the<br/>improviser/composer, in/out, old/new, etc., camps... witness his<br/>heartfelt and keen appreciation of Paul Desmond and Derek Bailey...<br/>Richard Teitelbaum and Sousa... Wagner and Warne Marsh...</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that Braxton&apos;s own music is an exceptionally<br/>difficult collision of improvised and notated schemes... It not only<br/>requires dynamic, intuitive players who can really think on their feet<br/>and personally contribute with a capital C, but it also demands some<br/>pretty fearsome sight-reading and the &quot;schooled&quot; like... In Braxton&apos;s<br/>music these may not be two sides of the same coin, but he certainly<br/>expects his players to be ready -- heads or tails!</p><p>There&apos;s so many ways to approach &quot;microtonality&quot; outside of those that<br/>are most frequently discussed on this list -- tempering and some<br/>stripe of just intonation. The &quot;problem&quot; is that most of them run out<br/>of analytical steam pretty quickly... I can say that they work, this I<br/>know, but I can&apos;t do much more than outline how and why in some pretty<br/>quickly depleted terms.</p><p>One example of this is the set of pieces I wrote for turntable quartet<br/>(two of these pieces, &quot;Blue Carousel&quot; and &quot;The Way I See You Know&quot;,<br/>are up at the aforementioned site should anyone be interested). I<br/>wrote this set of pieces back in &apos;87 as a way to better isolate and<br/>really focus in on certain aspects of intonation and simultaneity that<br/>I found, and still find, utterly fascinating. The method allowed for a<br/>dynamic manual adaptive retuning on the fly in strict quodlibet! No<br/>lattices or ratios or the like are gonna help much here and that&apos;s<br/>OK... but there are many, many ways to get your microtonal fill, and<br/>sometimes I feel a bit frustrated by my inability to give some of them<br/>with which I am familiar more air time here in this most active of<br/>microtonal forums...</p><p>Oh well, just some thoughts while they were fresh.</p><p>--d.stearns</p></div>
