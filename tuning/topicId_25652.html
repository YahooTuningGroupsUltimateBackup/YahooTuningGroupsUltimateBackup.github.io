That&apos;s 74 generators, which means 75 notes,<br/>which is the same as for the 11-limit diamond. This may be ok for the<br/>13-limit diamond, but it is a pretty poor mapping for Partch&apos;s 43<br/>because it has so many holes.</p><p>&gt; If<br/>&gt; it&apos;s correct, it does beat the multiple-29 mapping for<br/>&gt; notes-to-the-diamond.  But even by that criterion, this looks<br/>slightly<br/>&gt; better again:<br/>... 103.897 cent generator<br/>... 0.5 octave period<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; mapping by ... generator:<br/>&gt;... [1, -2, -8, -12, -15]))<br/>&gt; highest error: 0.004911  (5.893 cents)<br/>&gt; unique</p><p>That&apos;s equivalent to two chains of 703.9 cent fifths, a half octave<br/>apart. Anyone got a picture of a keyboard mapping for that?<br/>So is that 68 notes or 70 notes for the 13-limit diamond?</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
