At first exposure, I<br/>felt I could almost qualify it as a flattly tuned fourth, but after<br/>hearing it repeatedly, I still want to call it a wide major 3rd.</p><p>Thanks for listening and weighing in Jacky! I find that if I play the<br/>little &quot;O Beautiful&quot; descending minor 3rd motif as a major 3rd, then<br/>it really sounds 100%, obstinately WRONG... I used the descending<br/>10:13 as it seemed to me to project an acceptable recasting of the<br/>expected minor third *proportion wise* -- not quite as removed or<br/>&quot;remote&quot; sounding as a fourth, and not nearly as wrongish sounding as<br/>a major 3rd. I completely agree with you that context is everything<br/>(and if forced to call the an isolated 10:13 dyad something, I&apos;d have<br/>to say some flavor of 4th), and in the context of this piece I clearly<br/>hear the descending melodic 10:13 as an interval unto itself:<br/>definitely not a major third in the traditional or comparative sense,<br/>but not quite a fourth either.</p><p>&gt; The context IS everything - and this really shows it to be true,<br/>because - for contrast, if you play an arpeggio on a piano sound<br/>alone, of 1/1, 13/10 and 3/2 - just a first position triad, well this<br/>really wants to behave like a major triad.</p><p>I think I&apos;d more agree that the 13:15 sounds more like a minor third<br/>than a major second! Staccato? Maybe... Legato? I&apos;m mostly hearing it<br/>as its own thing again, independent of either the 3rd or a 4th... it<br/>would be interesting to know other folks observations and feelings for<br/>these &quot;no man&apos;s land&quot; intervals. (Maybe an interesting experiment for<br/>Joseph Pehrson&apos;s Tuning Lab would be to take a slate of some of Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s various local dyadic maxima and have folks offer there<br/>opinion of what those intervals most resemble?) The 13/10 really seems<br/>to me to sit pretty firmly on the fence... certainly more so than say<br/>the 11/9, to which my gut reaction is almost always, &quot;minor third,&quot;<br/>followed by some mild indecision and general misgivings! Perhaps it&apos;s<br/>because the 13/10 stubbornly lies between two so clearly defined<br/>interval classes?</p><p>&gt; I love using intervals that creat this kind of ambiguity, as a<br/>deliberate compositional choice. And I think that the context of their<br/>use really does affect the quality of perception, either nakedly or in<br/>a veiled sort of way. To me this is a more &quot;veiled&quot;, approach, in that<br/>it uses a familiar piece, and the part under analysis is a melody that<br/>you expect to do certain things. That is the delightful part of what<br/>you&apos;ve done here!!!</p><p>Thanks for all the kind comments Jacky, I do appreciate it. I think it<br/>really is the super strong expectation of a minor 3rd here that makes<br/>the &quot;10:13 as a major 3rd&quot; so untenable to me in this particular<br/>context... but that very same expectation also allows one the freedom<br/>to extrapolate its dynamic, or its motific and proportional<br/>implications, into a kaleidoscopic array of microtonal possibilities<br/>that lie completely outside the omnipresent confines of 12-tET...<br/>montani semper liberi!

It seems that the ear is much more<br/>forgiving of distuning of about all the other scale degrees. This is<br/>back to the idea that there is a sort of gradient scale of<br/>tonality/consonance relative to the harmonic series. Would it be<br/>correct to assume that there is a much broader band of the perception<br/>of &quot;minorness&quot;, &quot;majorness&quot; and &quot;neutralness&quot; around the 2nds, 3rds,<br/>6ths and 7ths? It is extremely interesting to me that &quot;Generally<br/>these categories begin and end at the &quot;quartertones&quot;&quot;, because as we<br/>are discussing here, it can become very paradoxical for the neutral<br/>intervals. Something interesting that I observed recently in my<br/>exploration of a huge number of different Neutral Ratio, is that<br/>there is also a broad band of perception of ratios, of which your ear<br/>can perceive as a Neutral Ratio as well. I roughly categorized them<br/>into 10 cents shifts away from the 12tET pitches: 50-40, 40-30 cents.<br/>I&apos;m sure, as stated above that the quality of neutralness is greatly<br/>influenced by the other pitches that neighbor it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky</p></div>
