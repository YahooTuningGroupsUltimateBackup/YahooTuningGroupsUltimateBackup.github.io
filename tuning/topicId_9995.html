It&apos;s hard to make it work on an<br/>acoustic guitar.  If you use an electric you don&apos;t need line that&apos;s too<br/>thick and rigid.  You still lose tone quality on the highest string though.<br/> You also need one or two pairs of pliers and a good knot which holds the<br/>line firmly to the neck.  It&apos;s hard to explain the knot, but I can try if<br/>you want me to.</p><p>jason</p></div>
