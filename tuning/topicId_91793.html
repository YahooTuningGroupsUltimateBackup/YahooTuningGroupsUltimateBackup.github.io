For the last month, I&apos;ve been<br/>in Miami, going back and from Haiti, and I had no instruments but a<br/>31-tet guitar. So I basically got to &quot;purify&quot; myself of 12-tet for a<br/>little bit (although I&apos;d still hear stuff on the radio in 12-tet), and<br/>I came to some interesting conclusions. One is that it has converted<br/>me from thinking that functional consonance and dissonance - in my<br/>view the most &quot;important&quot; kind of consonance in music - doesn&apos;t come<br/>from JI, but rather the diatonic/chromatic &quot;map&quot; that we are used to<br/>hearing things in.</p><p>The gurus here will no doubt have figured this out years ago, but for<br/>us sophomores - here&apos;s the evidence that has basically converted me<br/>over:<br/>- Play a minor scale in 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tet. Better yet, make<br/>it dorian. I really like dorian.<br/>- Now play it in some wide fifth superpyth tuning where the minor<br/>thirds approach 7/6. Let&apos;s say 22-tet or 27-tet.<br/>- Although you&apos;d have to be deaf to not hear the difference, if you&apos;re<br/>like me, these two basically sound like different tunings of the same<br/>underlying &quot;thing.&quot; Just like 378 cents and 400 cents sound like<br/>mistunings of the same underlying &quot;thing,&quot; these two scales sound like<br/>two different tunings of the same underlying &quot;thing&quot; as well.<br/>- All of this despite the fact that we&apos;re using a completely different<br/>JI interval for the minor thirds here.<br/>- In fact, to my ears, 6/5 and 7/6 themselves sound like two different<br/>variations of the same &quot;thing,&quot; and yet 5/4 and 6/5 don&apos;t. And 7/6 and<br/>8/7 don&apos;t either.</p><p>And the same principle applied for my going from 12-tet for 31-tet. At<br/>first, the major seconds sounded flat, but after playing a little<br/>chunk of the circle of fifths, my brain seemed to &quot;rewire&quot; itself to<br/>hear them as sounding normal. That is, although they didn&apos;t sound as<br/>&quot;stable&quot; as 12-tet&apos;s, they finally started to assume the same<br/>function, instead of just sounding like flat messed up 12-tet fifths.<br/>And when going back to 12-tet, the major thirds would sound terribly<br/>sharp, but as soon as I started playing a little chunk of the circle<br/>of fifths again, my brain remapped itself and they started to sound<br/>like major thirds again.</p><p>So the question is - how does this work? Paul basically turned me onto<br/>the idea that it&apos;s not that we&apos;re used to 12-tet per se, but that<br/>we&apos;re used to hearing &quot;diatonically&quot; (or perhaps &quot;chromatically&quot; these<br/>days). That is, we&apos;re used to hearing this underlying diatonic<br/>&quot;template&quot; which can be instantiated in 12-tet or 31-tet or 22-tet or<br/>anything else. I think it might have something to do with 3-limit<br/>hearing... any ideas? I&apos;ve read Rothenberg&apos;s papers at this point, but<br/>it seems to me like JI must be involved on SOME level...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=91796 href="#91796">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2010 12:03:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; So the question is - how does this work?
