There was absolutely *nothing* in what you said to<br/>indicate you were pointing to 15/13 by means of the complex ratio<br/>196/169, and there *still* is nothing which singles it out. You&apos;d<br/>mentioned 7/6, which is sharp of 196/169, but gave no slightest clue<br/>you intended to look flat, so I looked at the interval between<br/>197/169 and 7/6, and found many, many simpler ratios.</p><p>You want basics? Here are some basics. The semiconvergents to 196/169<br/>go 7/6, 8/7, 15/13, 22/19, 29/25, 51/44, 80/69, 109/94, 138/119,<br/>167/144, 196/169. Hence if 15/13 is being pointed at, it has company.<br/>Moreover, it isn&apos;t even a convergent! The convergents (this still is<br/>basic stuff, by the way) are 7/6, 22/19, 29/25, 167/144, 196/169. My<br/>29/25 is a third of a cent sharp of 196/169, whereas your 15/13 is<br/>nine cents flat of it. Since 7/6 is ten cents sharp of it, and is a<br/>much more dominating ratio than 15/13, so I think the notion that<br/>15/13 is very important to the sound of 196/169 is likely baloney<br/>anyway. But even if it isn&apos;t, *you* did not point any of this out.</p><p>&gt; because it&apos;s the<br/>&gt; simplest description of what 196/169 does in the first two dozen<br/>&gt; partials or so, which is to have a (near) unison of it&apos;s 13th<br/>&gt; partial with the 15th partial of the 1/1.</p><p>It is *not* the simplest description. This is just plain wrong.</p><p>&gt; Where we disagree, as far as I can make out, is how important this<br/>&gt; is compared to sheer proximity to the most simple intervals. For<br/>&gt; example, 196/169 is about 10 cents from 7/6, yet in some ways it is<br/>&gt; perhaps as consonant- look at the eighth partial, as well as the<br/>&gt; 13th, for example.</p><p>This &quot;look at the partials&quot; is not a theory! If you want to propose a<br/>theory, you need to say exactly and precisely what looking at the<br/>partials *means*, and how it can be quantified.</p><p>&gt; Simple as pie really.</p><p>Then why can&apos;t you do it? Your analytical comments on 196/169 make no<br/>sense, in that they don&apos;t point to anything special about 196/169.<br/>Why are you talking about it and not 29/25 or 22/15 (which is the<br/>mediant between 15/13 and 7/6?)</p></div><h3><a id=70075 href="#70075">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2007 3:58:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If it were up to you, the brew would be nothing but newt eye!</p><p>:-) I&apos;ll judge the nature of the ingredients by the taste of the brew,<br/>thanks.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=70134 href="#70134">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2007 3:31:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re going to talk about partials and consonance,<br/>&gt; you need to start talking about sensory dissonance calculations,<br/>&gt; the critical band, etc.</p><p>Feel free to talk about these things, I will continue to LISTEN to<br/>them as I have for so long.</p><p>It just occured to me that you might not have a simple way to do<br/>that, I&apos;ll copy and paste the Csound L/R-sines code I wrote for this<br/>very purpose to the bottom of this message.</p><p>&gt;Coinciding partials do not cause<br/>&gt; consonance.</p><p>Please take a little time to think over the old Tonverschmelzung<br/>theory of consonance, and the argument against it.</p><p>&gt;Though I did suggest recently that a large number<br/>&gt; of coinciding spectral energy given the condition of zero<br/>&gt; critical band interactions may account for &quot;equivalence&quot;.</p><p>Think very carefully about what you just said.

However, it&apos;s pretty close to<br/>&gt;29/25.<br/>&gt; The mediant, (15+7)/(13+6) = 22/19, also comes to mind.</p><p>It looks like the simplest explanation is the best, and in this case<br/>29/25 works perfectly.</p><p>The practical method for finding these zones goes like this:</p><p>take two different offset x/harmonic sets. They can&apos;t be offset too<br/>much and the harmonic has to be in range where you could clearly<br/>hear it making a distinct change in timbre, on its own, in additive<br/>synthesis, ie. &lt;24 in my opinion.</p><p>For example: 13/12, 14/12, 15/12, 16/12 as one set, and<br/>14/13,15/13,16/13,17/13 as the other set. Then you find the halfway<br/>point between each pair and that&apos;s your basic tuning.</p><p>In the scale I&apos;m posting here, this is exactly what I did for the<br/>lower pentachord, then above 3/2, simply duplicated the intervals.<br/>So it&apos;s a very simple implementation. In this case I went from the<br/>x/12 down to the nearest x/13. So, the M3 is the halfway point of<br/>15/12 (5/4) and 16/13, the flatted 4th is halfway between 16/12<br/>(4/3) and 17/13, etc.</p><p>A quick check through the key partials and it looks like, yes,<br/>there&apos;s near-coincidence within the sweet zone of a few Hz.<br/>throughout the intervals. The specific near-concidences I wanted<br/>were based on the 1/1- they move when other intervals are played<br/>together without the 1/1, of course. But as I continue to check,<br/>there seems to be a logic to it, and a great deal of near-<br/>coincidences within the first two dozen partials.</p><p>Smiling.scl<br/>!<br/>x/12 mates with x/13<br/> 9<br/>!<br/> 138/125<br/> 29/25<br/> 31/25<br/> 33/25<br/> 3/2<br/> 207/125<br/> 87/50<br/> 93/50<br/> 2/1</p><p>Gene, your suggestion to use 29/25 worked out perfectly- the<br/>irrational mid-points between the two parent tunings are expressed<br/>with these ratios with amazing precision.</p><p>Well, according to my ears this meets all the criteria I listen for.<br/>A couple of the intervals are within a cent or two of intervals that<br/>I found by trial and error listening trying to find intervals in the<br/>same &quot;family&quot; as the original 196/169, tickled pink about that.</p><p>The &quot;shadow tuning&quot; of difference tones also sounds great, IMO.</p><p>thanks again,</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=70172 href="#70172">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2007 8:53:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; spectral energy IN THE REGION OF SPECIFIC PARTIALS,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which region is that?<br/>&gt;<br/>Playing the horn inbetween the 13th and 14th partials is really a<br/>challenge:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_trumpet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_trumpet</a><br/>&quot;The natural harmonic series has several notes that are out-of-tune to<br/>modern western perception, notably the 7th, 11th and 13th partials.<br/>Where a composition demands these notes, the player must &apos;lip&apos; them<br/>into tune, a notoriously difficult task.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barocktrompete">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barocktrompete</a><br/>&quot;Das Spiel in den hohen, chromatischen Lagen (ab 13.

About a<br/>month ago I wrote something here about doing additive synthesis and<br/>raising specific partials alone or with their neighbors, and how the<br/>timbre changes differently with different pairs.</p><p>This is why I chose x/12 and x/13 as the two series to &quot;mate&quot; by<br/>finding the midpoints between pairs from the two series. The ideal<br/>would be to have near-coincidences with the pure harmonic series in<br/>partials 6,7,12,13,19, which is what happens with 196/169,29/25, and<br/>any interval in the tiny region between them.</p><p>In that tiny region, these near-coincidences (we want to avoid both<br/>Tonverschmelzung and critical band nastiness at each partial, so<br/>it&apos;s a little zone) mean that we have the character of both 7/6 and<br/>16/13, and a little of 8/7 and 22/19 (the 7th and 19th partials).<br/>So, played with the 1/1, a tone at the interval would,<br/>theoretically, and audibly as far as I can tell, load these specific<br/>regions with more energy, thereby creating a subtle timbral effect.</p><p>And if throughout the tuning you could get the same and related<br/>timbral effects, you might get what I&apos;ve been humorously calling<br/>an &quot;Uebertimbre&quot; but should probably be called the Gesamtklangfarbe<br/>der Einstimmung or some such ungodly thing.</p><p>Of course you cannot square the circle: the timbre would change with<br/>different keys, by virtue of the emphasized regions moving. This is<br/>desirable.</p><p>Both your equal-frequency Bach tuning and the Werckmeister 196-<br/>monochord tuning are made in the ways which I have found by trial<br/>and error guarantee more likelihood of this kind of cohesiveness,<br/>which I find audible but maybe not everyone does. Both constant/x<br/>and x/constant tunings also tend to have very cohesive and good-<br/>sounding &quot;shadow tunings&quot; consisting of all the possible difference<br/>tones octave-reduced.</p><p>There are some curious things about 14/13, and 14/13*14/13, and yet<br/>another 14/13 gives you a wonderful M3...who knows? Perhaps the 196-<br/>monochord is a simple practical mechanism for tempering the Just<br/>intervals not by dividing a comma, but by pushing them toward the<br/>regions where they start to take on the characters of the next<br/>higher primes.</p><p>take care,</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
