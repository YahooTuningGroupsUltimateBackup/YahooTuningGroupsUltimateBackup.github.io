As a note: His wife Lisa is open to the prospect of any of these works being presented by others inclined after these performances and i will have his notes/scores available to make this possible.<br/>Basically it requires permission from her, which is being asked for the mere purpose of knowing about the performance. This can be done through myself.  Rod had a very detailed notebook that contained many of the innovative ways he expanded his 17 tone just scale by the use of open tunings. this we plan to have as an online resource in the future.</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
