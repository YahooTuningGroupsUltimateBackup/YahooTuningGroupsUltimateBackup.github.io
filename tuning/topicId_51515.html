I own it but<br/>still haven&apos;t read it... !  :)</p><p>After doing that, and I would study &quot;figured bass&quot; and Roman Numeral<br/>terminology as a part of this, you will be in a much better position<br/>to analyze &quot;progressions...&quot;</p><p>I doubt very seriously, then, that you will make a selection of root<br/>position triads and then ask us which series of them is the<br/>most &quot;consonant&quot; progression... :)</p><p>J.

Mathieu assumes<br/>that each mode of the diatonic scale (in 12-equal) is heard as a<br/>different, idiosyncratically-shaped JI structure. And that &quot;comma<br/>pumps&quot; will be heard as JI progressions with one huge leap from one<br/>end of the lattice to another at some specific point in the<br/>progression. Both of these assumptions are highly unnecessary and<br/>misleading, I think, if one views temperament correctly.</p><p>Monz&apos;s Tonalsoft software is really going to help people in this<br/>department, and probably for many practical ends as well.</p><p>Not to mention that Mathieu allows the significance of meantone to<br/>completely fall through the cracks, fostering the tired old &quot;JI vs.<br/>ET&quot; mentality, where easily 1/3 of his book could -- and should --<br/>have been devoted to meantone examples (just about anything from 1480-<br/>1780 would fit the bill).</p></div>
