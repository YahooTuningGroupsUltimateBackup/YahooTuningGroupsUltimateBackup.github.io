So only unique numbers are counted. This takes into consideration that inversions can vary quite drastically according to spacing. In fact it is the only method i know that even takes this into account at all.  It is not perfect but is an advancement over treating all inversions equally, which seems a bit absurd. It lacks something with subharmonics as it does lean them as being more dissonant than they seem to be.   For Harmonic 11 limit chords the formula has been worked out and was<br/>used in the following composition<br/> <a href="http://anaphoria.com/lullaby.html">http://anaphoria.com/lullaby.html</a><br/>where the numbers correspond to the above formula.</p><p> One has only to compare the sound of some of the latter with some of the earlier chords with the same notes in a difference spacing to realize how little we know but just looking at the factors.<br/> which i will call Grady&apos;s consonance scale II.</p><p> Maybe it needed a name for those on this list to think it as real.</p><p>Grady&apos;s consonance scale 1 was where repeated numbers where not omited but it seemed to not be as good t to my ear.</p><p>    In the 80&apos;s, i did quite a few compositions on single tetrads and this formula seemed to work quite well.<br/> it was quite practical in that instrumentalist only have to learn a few pitches and their octives and since the piece would stay on this chord, they could use there ears. a few though did alternate between roots a 5th away from each other.</p><p> I would have hope that those so geared in math could come up with a quick method to figure this out as well as taking a set of ratios and going through the inversions. to run through all 720 inversions of a hexany takes a while.  I did only one with the inversions of a  hexany as it was way too time consuming for me. I did not use all the inversions thpough but selected those that really grabbed me but using them in an order for con. to dis. i would be more than happy to investigate this further for with any one with the know-how and ear to do so.</p><p>    The thing I got from all of these experiments is that  consonances is not necessarily determined by lower number ratios but by &apos;coincidence&apos; in your tones and difference tones. If one tries to do the most dissonant sounds such as Phi, we run across difference tones that generate tone of your scale or series, hence making them sound often quite consonant. Obviously the method above is not quite capable of dealing with these type of chords. Helmholtz&apos;s method is good in that it also is quite effected by range, where the same chord will be more of less, depending on where it is. And Sethares approach points to also the influence of timbre.<br/>It is probably this level of complexity that had me stop where i did, one could spend a lifetime on this.</p><p>    Novaro on the other Hand made quite a bit to do about chords where the tones are seperated by a repeated difference tone number . An example might be clearer as in 11,17, 23,29 with 6 being a common difference tone between successive tones. Chord of such construction often sound quite consonant, even high harmonics.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: Alison Monteith &lt;<a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Ranking Eikosany tetrads and hexanies<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone (Paul, Gene, Monz?) come up with a method for ranking tetrads and<br/>&gt; hexanies according to their consonance/dissonance?

With inharmonic timbres (and<br/>I did specify period timbres, which are not inharmonic), all theories<br/>predict that using whatever intervals make the inharmonic partials<br/>coincide will tend to produce more consonance than one would<br/>otherwise predict. But in Western common-practice music theory (which<br/>is based almost entirely on harmonic timbres, plus a few nearly<br/>harmonic ones like the piano, guitar, and specially shaped<br/>metallophones), the dichotomy between consonances and dissonances is<br/>*not* dependent on timbre.

But even<br/>that is too vague.  It all started with kraig grady&apos;s reference to Novaro,<br/>and his 11:17:23:29 (difference of 6) example.  I was thinking don&apos;t use<br/>integers at all, neglecting that rational approximations would get in the<br/>way.  But just to complete the original thought, suppose you take instead:</p><p>    pi : pi + 6 : pi + 12 : pi + 18</p><p>where pi is the familiar circumference/diameter ratio.  Potentially the 22/7<br/>approximation for pi might make this not the best possible example though.<br/>Also the choice of 6 may not be the best here.</p><p>To take the thought to its ultimate conclusion, I probably end up begging a<br/>theory of dissonance/consonance rating for a means to pick the &quot;most<br/>dissonance possible&quot; chord, rather than the &quot;most irrational possible&quot;,<br/>since after all there is no theory at all (or so I imagine) for ranking<br/>degree of rationality.  So if you have a dissonance ranking scheme, then<br/>device a way to search for maximally dissonant chords with maximally<br/>consonant difference tones.  But I can&apos;t imagine what theoretical approach<br/>would make this in to a finite problem without consequent assumptions that<br/>might defeat the hypothesis.  Pseudo-random numbers might have a problem in<br/>this domain that is not a problem for general statistical purposes.  But<br/>maybe random is good enough to start with.</p><p>Does that clarify?</p><p>This brings up a terminology question:  how do you deal with the concept if<br/>an irrational ratio?  Ratio tends to imply integers in the context of<br/>tunings, does it not?  Is there another word or a way of making the<br/>distinction that is customary here?</p><p>&gt;&gt; It occurs to me however, that testing a predictor of<br/>&gt; consonance/dissonance<br/>&gt;&gt; with electronically-generated sound will be *very* problematic due<br/>&gt; to the<br/>&gt;&gt; conversion of difference tones to faint *actual* tones by almost<br/>&gt; any speaker<br/>&gt;&gt; (never mind amplifiers), due to intermodulation distortion.<br/>&gt; Probably<br/>&gt;&gt; intermodulation also occurs to some extent in any material (e.g. so<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt;&gt; playing chords on a single guitar would yield suspect results),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, I think that an even more important effect on the guitar is<br/>&gt; sympathetic resonance between different modes of vibration on<br/>&gt; different strings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; though<br/>&gt;&gt; probably it is vainishingly small when separately generated sounds<br/>&gt; are mixed<br/>&gt;&gt; in the air, so that playing several solo instruments in the same<br/>&gt; room<br/>&gt;&gt; (without vibrating windows) would yield valid results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, difference tones in the ear can be loud, almost<br/>&gt; overwhelming, for two soprano recorders playing together, for example.</p><p>Oh, yes, I&apos;ve heard that.  So it will be really hard to sort out<br/>intermodulation caused &quot;externally&quot; vs &quot;somewhat externally&quot; in the<br/>eardrum/bones vs internally in the nervous system.  But if there is a range<br/>over which amplitude can be reduced with no consequent reduction in the<br/>&quot;effect&quot; (whatever consonance/dissonance effect is being examined), then<br/>that might allow external factors to be eliminated, though admittedly it<br/>still depends on an intuitive argument, I think, to make such a claim.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Mind you I&apos;m not saying a theory about guitar chords (for example)<br/>&gt; is not<br/>&gt;&gt; relevant, just that that has to be put aside if the<br/>&gt; relevance/irrelevance of<br/>&gt;&gt; difference tones (without intermodulation that makes them *real*)<br/>&gt; is being<br/>&gt;&gt; established.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But something about this whole question surprises me:  the fact<br/>&gt; that it came<br/>&gt;&gt; up in a context in which (unless I missed something) timbre was not<br/>&gt;&gt; mentioned once.  Surely you can&apos;t be talking about chords built up<br/>&gt; from pure<br/>&gt;&gt; sinusoidal harmonics can you?  But if not, how can you disregard<br/>&gt; timbre<br/>&gt;&gt; (although putting inharmonicity side seems reasonable).  But if so,<br/>&gt; then you<br/>&gt;&gt; are talking about a different kind of consonance than what we I<br/>&gt; have been<br/>&gt;&gt; assuming in most of the discussions I have followed on this list.<br/>&gt; Certainly<br/>&gt;&gt; in some discussions (of piano tuning for example) inharmonicity<br/>&gt; played a big<br/>&gt;&gt; role.  So it would seem to follow that even without inharmonicity<br/>&gt; being<br/>&gt;&gt; involved timbre must enter into the question of consonance.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Kurt<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Timbre does enter into the question. With harmonic timbres, a greater<br/>&gt; amplitude in the higher harmonics will translate into clearer pitch<br/>&gt; perceptions, less confusion of complex ratios with simpler ratios,<br/>&gt; and by all theories, a greater propensity to find local minima of<br/>&gt; dissonance at ratios of higher numbers. With inharmonic timbres (and<br/>&gt; I did specify period timbres, which are not inharmonic), all theories<br/>&gt; predict that using whatever intervals make the inharmonic partials<br/>&gt; coincide will tend to produce more consonance than one would<br/>&gt; otherwise predict. But in Western common-practice music theory (which<br/>&gt; is based almost entirely on harmonic timbres, plus a few nearly<br/>&gt; harmonic ones like the piano, guitar, and specially shaped<br/>&gt; metallophones), the dichotomy between consonances and dissonances is<br/>&gt; *not* dependent on timbre. This is a nice property that is<br/>&gt; convenient, and possible to some extent, to extend to experimental<br/>&gt; musics involving harmonies derived from ratios of somewhat larger<br/>&gt; intervals.</p><p>Wonderful to have anything convenient at all!</p><p>-Kurt</p><p>&gt; The experiments on the harmonic entropy list were done with a<br/>&gt; particular periodic timbre -- a rectified sine wave -- which has a<br/>&gt; fairly &quot;average&quot; amplitude in its higher harmonics. I&apos;d be happy to<br/>&gt; repeat the experiment with a different timbre if you post to that<br/>&gt; effect over on that list, but I doubt that any periodic timbre would<br/>&gt; yield tetrad rankings showing marked deviations from the general<br/>&gt; pattern we found.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep up the good thinking,<br/>&gt; Paul</p></div><h3><a id=48742 href="#48742">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 1:18:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 11/28/03 9:53 PM, Paul Erlich &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; on 11/28/03 3:01 PM, Paul Erlich &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Kraig, Roederer as well as all the other modern references I know<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; do *not* equate or relate the fundamental tracking (a.k.a. virtual<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; pitch, etc.) mechanism to difference tones or any other<br/>&gt; combinational<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tones.

I was at first inclined to dismiss experiments with<br/>sinusoids as &quot;notes&quot; as being musically meaningless.  Carl once played me<br/>some music from someone (on this list?) who created music in 12et that was<br/>contrived to have no beats by manipulation of the frequencies of the<br/>partials.  I can&apos;t remember it well enough to decide whether this means &quot;no<br/>dissonance&quot;, but I suspect that there was in fact still an active<br/>consonance/dissonance axis in spite of the &quot;beatless&quot; kind of consonance<br/>being a given.  If so, then perhaps using sinusoids is best.  Not using<br/>sinusoids presents other problems I&apos;d rather not deal with anyway.  If you<br/>are inclined to agree then I&apos;d suggest starting with a few &quot;favorite&quot; 4-note<br/>or larger chords like 4:5:6:7 or 8:9:10:11 as a base, use a sinusoid for<br/>each note, and then add a variable value to each element of the ratio, as<br/>in:</p><p>    4+v : 5+v : 6+v : 7+v</p><p>and initially just provide a way of semi-continuously varying v over a range<br/>like -.5 to +.5.  And just listen to the results.  How does the implied<br/>&quot;fundamental&quot; vary, if at all, and does this depend on the range over which<br/>v is varied?</p><p>And actually, I did not mean to pick chords where the ratios are an unbroken<br/>series of integers, as both exaples above seemed to indicate.  So including<br/>5:7:9:11 adds some breadth.   And including 4:7:9:10 adds even more.  The<br/>point would be to make as few assumptions as possible, and try some things,<br/>and hear the results.</p><p>Control over the frequency corresponding to &quot;1&quot; would also be important.</p><p>&gt;&gt; so that the same differences are<br/>&gt;&gt; retained, and see over what ranges of variation the harmonic versus<br/>&gt;&gt; difference-tone model has the most relevance.

What I wrote above doesn&apos;t concern harmonic<br/>&gt; consonances (directly) at all, but rather our pitch perception<br/>&gt; mechanism, which extracts a heard pitch from a set of partials even<br/>&gt; when there is no physical energy at or near the frequency<br/>&gt; corresponding to the heard pitch.</p><p>It would be great if a web-enabled applet could be created that allowed up<br/>to 8 integers to be entered, and provided mouse control over the offset v,<br/>with real-time audible results.

I was thinking along the lines of picking<br/>numbers<br/>&gt; whose closest rational approximation involves very large integers.<br/>But even<br/>&gt; that is too vague.  It all started with kraig grady&apos;s reference to<br/>Novaro,<br/>&gt; and his 11:17:23:29 (difference of 6) example.  I was thinking<br/>don&apos;t use<br/>&gt; integers at all, neglecting that rational approximations would get<br/>in the<br/>&gt; way.  But just to complete the original thought, suppose you take<br/>instead:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     pi : pi + 6 : pi + 12 : pi + 18<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where pi is the familiar circumference/diameter ratio.  Potentially<br/>the 22/7<br/>&gt; approximation for pi might make this not the best possible example<br/>though.<br/>&gt; Also the choice of 6 may not be the best here.</p><p>Well, thanks for sharing your incomplete thoughts. You may be<br/>touching on the fact that any theory that uses the numbers in the<br/>ratios is ultimately flawed. You are absolutely correct, and that is<br/>one of the primary reasons for harmonic entropy theory. One recovers<br/>the simple numerical formulae only for the very simplest just<br/>intervals and chords.</p><p>&gt; To take the thought to its ultimate conclusion, I probably end up<br/>begging a<br/>&gt; theory of dissonance/consonance rating for a means to pick the &quot;most<br/>&gt; dissonance possible&quot; chord, rather than the &quot;most irrational<br/>possible&quot;,<br/>&gt; since after all there is no theory at all (or so I imagine) for<br/>ranking<br/>&gt; degree of rationality.</p><p>If I understand you correctly, the latter is not even necessary. For<br/>example, dyadic harmonic entropy with one particular choice for<br/>the &apos;resolution&apos; parameter shows its biggest hump at 70 cents, so<br/>this would be the most dissonant dyad under this scheme.</p><p>&gt; So if you have a dissonance ranking scheme, then<br/>&gt; device a way to search for maximally dissonant chords with maximally<br/>&gt; consonant difference tones.  But I can&apos;t imagine what theoretical<br/>approach<br/>&gt; would make this in to a finite problem without consequent<br/>assumptions that<br/>&gt; might defeat the hypothesis.  Pseudo-random numbers might have a<br/>problem in<br/>&gt; this domain that is not a problem for general statistical<br/>purposes.  But<br/>&gt; maybe random is good enough to start with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does that clarify?</p><p>Well, there is a beautiful answer to your question that,<br/>unfortunately, relies on a somewhat unrealistic model, and that<br/>*does* use the notion of &quot;degree of rationality&quot; that you mentioned<br/>above. Ask a mathematician or physicist what the most irrational<br/>ratio is, and they will tell you it&apos;s the golden ratio. The reasons<br/>for this have been much explored on this list and on the web, and I<br/>can repeat them later if necessary. The reasons these reasons are<br/>pretty irrelevant for consonance/dissonance theory, I can go into as<br/>well. But the golden ratio has the wonderful property that squaring<br/>it yields the same result as adding 1 to it. So the difference tones<br/>occuring in a series of tones having the golden ratio between<br/>successive tones will all line up with tones in the series -- the<br/>difference tone between tone x+1 and tone x+2 will be tone x. So this<br/>satisfies your desire, in some (somewhat naive) sense, of a maximally<br/>dissonant chord with maximally consonant difference tones. Kraig is a<br/>big fan of such series and has posted about them in the past -- not<br/>only this golden series, but lots of other interesting series where<br/>certain difference tones coincide with certain scale tones.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This brings up a terminology question:  how do you deal with the<br/>concept if<br/>&gt; an irrational ratio?  Ratio tends to imply integers in the context<br/>of<br/>&gt; tunings, does it not?  Is there another word or a way of making the<br/>&gt; distinction that is customary here?</p><p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with saying &quot;irrational ratio&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Actually, difference tones in the ear can be loud, almost<br/>&gt; &gt; overwhelming, for two soprano recorders playing together, for<br/>example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, yes, I&apos;ve heard that.  So it will be really hard to sort out<br/>&gt; intermodulation caused &quot;externally&quot; vs &quot;somewhat externally&quot; in the<br/>&gt; eardrum/bones vs internally in the nervous system.</p><p>Not necessarily. As Kraig touched on, experiments have been done<br/>which present tones separately to each ear, so that any<br/>intermodulation can&apos;t be occuring in either ear. As I recall, out of<br/>the whole series there&apos;s only one combinational tone, a cubic<br/>difference tone in fact, that can&apos;t be explained by a simple<br/>nonlinear response in each ear.</p><p>&gt; But if there is a range<br/>&gt; over which amplitude can be reduced with no consequent reduction in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &quot;effect&quot; (whatever consonance/dissonance effect is being examined),<br/>then<br/>&gt; that might allow external factors to be eliminated, though<br/>admittedly it<br/>&gt; still depends on an intuitive argument, I think, to make such a<br/>claim.</p><p>Somewhat, although as shown in the Feynman lectures, all &quot;physical&quot;<br/>combinational tones should show a dependence on external amplitude<br/>that is &quot;quadratic&quot;, &quot;cubic&quot;, etc. according to their order, and in<br/>fact, as I recall, only the one cubic difference tone fails to obey<br/>this relationship.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p></div><h3><a id=48766 href="#48766">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 9:58:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To take the thought to its ultimate conclusion, I probably end up<br/>begging a<br/>&gt; theory of dissonance/consonance rating for a means to pick the &quot;most<br/>&gt; dissonance possible&quot; chord, rather than the &quot;most irrational<br/>possible&quot;,<br/>&gt; since after all there is no theory at all (or so I imagine) for<br/>ranking<br/>&gt; degree of rationality.</p><p>In the sense you seem to mean, there actually is such a thing; the<br/>golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2 is sometimes even called &quot;most irrational&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=48768 href="#48768">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 10:10:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; It would be interesting to take a large harmonic consonance<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Meaning . . .

The implied fundamental, or virtual<br/>pitch, *does* vary as a function of v. In your example, if v is<br/>about .2, the pitch will be approximately 1.05. When v approaches .5,<br/>there are about three different pitches evoked; though the sensation<br/>isn&apos;t really that of a &apos;triad&apos;, similarity is found with sinusoids<br/>with frequencies of about 1.1, about 0.9, and, of course, about 0.5.</p><p>&gt; And actually, I did not mean to pick chords where the ratios are an<br/>unbroken<br/>&gt; series of integers, as both exaples above seemed to indicate.

Try it in 22-equal -- the chord occurs in my<br/>&gt; piece _TIBIA_.</p><p>In the first one I tend to hear a single entity, in spite of rough movement.<br/>(I&apos;m used to rough movement in &quot;celeste&quot; renderings from french romantic<br/>organ.)  In the second I am getting an impression that seems to conflict<br/>with my ability to have an &quot;overall&quot; sense of pitch (and yes, I mean pitch,<br/>not interval).  It is as if I am more distracted by some of the upper notes<br/>in a way that (to use your word from below) tugs my perception away from the<br/>lower ones.  Very curious that the just chord should create a more divided<br/>perception and the tempered a more unified one.  Perhaps the movement<br/>creates some forgiveness; perhaps it also allows the perception to rest more<br/>(&quot;lulled&quot; by the ease of the movement) into a wholistic perception.  Perhaps<br/>the 7 is harder to unify than the 3 (no surprise), and perhaps there is a<br/>unifying way of hearing which &quot;kicks in&quot; when sufficient ambiguity is<br/>present, and which the just rendering does not allow because of its<br/>explicitness.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Maybe a different inversion would give different results?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this voicing the 22-equal version is very near a local mimimum of<br/>&gt; total diadic harmonic entropy. That won&apos;t be true for most, if any,<br/>&gt; other voicings. The reason is the two 7:4 approximations and the one<br/>&gt; 7:3 approximation -- in most inversions these intervals will be too<br/>&gt; complex to influence the three 4:3s (or 3:2s!) much, except to push<br/>&gt; them in the *opposite* (meantone) direction since when 7:3 becomes<br/>&gt; 12:7, it gets tugged beyond 27:16 and toward 5:3.</p><p>It would be nice to have a tool (web page?) that displayed an N-et note<br/>space of several octaves (and I don&apos;t mean to imply 2/1 octaves as a<br/>requirement), and allowed chords of given ratios to be mapped on to the N-et<br/>space.  Does something like this exist?  I realize the conflict between<br/>rendering individual intervals in an et and rendering a chord.  But you seem<br/>to be assuming in what you say above that there is an understood method of<br/>chosing the best N-et rendering for a given chord.  Is this something that<br/>scala even does in a sufficiently sophisticated way as to be generally<br/>agreeable and not require hand-tweaking?  (That is:  rounding to the closest<br/>note requires some anchoring.  It is assumed that the chord note spelled as<br/>&quot;1/1&quot; will fall on an exact N-et note?)  And this also assumes no<br/>restrictive horizontal dependencies are involved, something which I am still<br/>questioning and haven&apos;t had enough experience with.

This chart shows the<br/>stepsize and the greatest error among the primary or &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>intervals within the harmonic (odd-)limit, both in cents, for all ETs<br/>up to 200TET, for all harmonic limits within which they are<br/>consistent. So each line goes,</p><p>ET stpsz max-3-lmt-err max-5-lmt-err max-7-lmt-err max-9-limit-err . .</p><p>and peters out when inconsistency is reached:</p><p><a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist3.txt">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote/consist3.txt</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; If tempering is necessary, doesn&apos;t this mean the original<br/>intention<br/>&gt; &gt; of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; chord choice might be flawed?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you mean by that? I thought you appreciated that the<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily tempered chord sounded more &apos;unified&apos; than Carl&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; just &apos;de-tempering&apos; of it. Is this &apos;unified&apos; flavor not enough of<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; justification for chord choice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I heard that, but was confused - as explained above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yet again I am surprised in a way that tempering should clarify a<br/>JI chord.<br/>&gt; And on another level I have not made sense of utonality at all and<br/>somehow<br/>&gt; would not expect this unification in anything but a purely otonal<br/>chord<br/>&gt; (assuming a JI chord in the first place).  By &quot;purely otonal&quot; I<br/>also mean to<br/>&gt; imply a &quot;reasonably&quot; low odd-limit, so that the implied fundamental<br/>would<br/>&gt; not be too low.</p><p>Aha -- now you&apos;re talking about a different chordal odd-limit<br/>definition than what&apos;s explicitly in there now (which we can<br/>call &quot;intervallic limit&quot;), let&apos;s call it the &quot;otonal limit&quot;, which I<br/>just hinted at in my last post to Alison. I think SCALA already<br/>calculates both. I also think, assuming low enough numbers, that both<br/>the &quot;otonal limit&quot; (since it models harmonic entropy) and<br/>the &quot;intervallic limit&quot; (since it models roughness) are relevant to a<br/>chord&apos;s concordance, but the &quot;utonal limit&quot; isn&apos;t -- if you think it<br/>is, try calculating it for the chords below. See</p><p><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/erlichs.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/erlichs.htm</a></p><p>and</p><p><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm</a></p><p>First, let&apos;s look at the major triad -- intervallic limit and otonal<br/>limit both 5. Don&apos;t get it? Read on . . .</p><p>Let&apos;s look at the minor triad; we can strip away the 2s since we&apos;re<br/>assuming octave equivalence. Its otonal limit is 15 since it&apos;s<br/>expressed as 3:5:15, but its intervallic limit is 5, since none of<br/>its intervals exceed an odd-limit of 5.</p><p>Next, let&apos;s look at the major seventh chord again, 8:10:12:15, otonal<br/>limit also 15. Its intervallic limit *would* be 5 except for that one<br/>ratio of 15, 15:8 -- the other five intervals in the chord are much<br/>more concordant. Thus, it&apos;s quite a bit more discordant than the<br/>minor triad, but beautiful nonetheless.</p><p>Now look at the triad 7:9:13 -- both limits are 13. Otonally it&apos;s no<br/>more complex than the minor triad, but intervallically it&apos;s far<br/>rougher -- this is revealed by listening.</p><p>Finally, consider 1/9:1/7:1/1. Intervallic limit is 9, but otonally<br/>the chord is 7:9:63 -- a doubtfully high stretch up the harmonic<br/>series by any standard. How does it compare with 7:9:13, in your<br/>opinion?</p><p>(of course the answer will probably depend on timbre . . .)</p><p>When speaking of specific voicings, hence in octave-specific terms,<br/>it would seem that one should use an &apos;integer-limit&apos; rather than &apos;odd-<br/>limit&apos; definition for the otonal and intervallic limits. That&apos;s fine.<br/>But it&apos;s actually better to use *products*, rather than odd- or<br/>integer-limits, to evaluate the two components of concordance (as<br/>always, the caveat: for JI chords where the numbers are not too<br/>large).</p><p>&gt; And there I wonder whether limits of ordinary hearing enter into the<br/>&gt; perception of implied fundamentals.  It would be interesting to<br/>know for<br/>&gt; example whether a perceived &quot;unified flavor&quot; of a chord depends on<br/>a single<br/>&gt; implied fundamental for the entire chord being in the audible range.</p><p>The stack of narrowed fourths -- the chord you identified as having<br/>a &apos;unified flavor&apos; -- certainly does not have a single, clear implied<br/>fundamental -- if it is indeed interpreted that way, it can be heard<br/>somewhat as 9:12:16:21, somewhat as 12:16:21:28, amybe somewhat as<br/>27:36:48:64, etc. But any of these rendered as a JI chord would have<br/>an intervallic limit of at least 21, while the stack of narrowed<br/>fourths would have a supposed intervallic limit of 7 -- mitigated<br/>somewhat (but not completely, if the tempering is successful) by the<br/>impurity of the six supposed 7-limit concordant intervals. This,<br/>then, appears to represent the &apos;unification&apos; effected by the<br/>tempering of the chord -- all the intervals are close to lining up<br/>lots of partials, hence the sensation is an &apos;integrated&apos; one, without<br/>implying a fundamental -- much like the first inversion of the minor<br/>triad (OK, getting octave-specific there), or better yet, like some<br/>of Bill Sethares&apos;s chords where Tuning has been made to nearly match<br/>some inharmonic Timbre.</p><p>&gt; And it<br/>&gt; would be interesting to extend the same question to tempered chords<br/>that are<br/>&gt; sufficiently out-of-JI to destroy any &quot;apparent&quot; hearing of the<br/>implied<br/>&gt; fundamental.  (I&apos;m taking some liberties with terminology that is<br/>fairly new<br/>&gt; to me, so I hope it works out ok.)</p><p>I think in this case, there is relatively little clarity to the<br/>implied fundamental even in Carl&apos;s JI chord, or the first-inversion<br/>minor triad, or in the 1/9:1/7:1/1 chord mentioned earlier. So chords<br/>need not be tempered to exhibit this &apos;fundamentallessness&apos; :) On the<br/>other hand, if you start with a clear otonal chord, and move it<br/>sufficiently out-of-JI to destroy the apparent fundamental, but no<br/>further, you&apos;re going to end up with a not-unified, discordant<br/>sonority.</p><p>:) Join the harmonic entropy list :)</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=48932 href="#48932">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2003 5:35:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; and at least complicates<br/>&gt; the notion when &quot;stacking&quot; of JI intervals that each have their own<br/>life is<br/>&gt; involved.</p><p>That shouldn&apos;t complicate the notion, since the &quot;stacking&quot; takes care<br/>of itself automatically as long as the &quot;rungs&quot; in the lattice satisfy<br/>whatever &apos;concordance&apos; (or other?) criterion that&apos;s deemed necessary<br/>to make the language of, or a mapping from, ratios meaningful.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Usually Paul and I prefer RMS error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and I should look back at what has been said about this.<br/>Minimize<br/>&gt; error on all the intervals?

But here, and especially on<br/>tuning math, we&apos;ve introduced/refined a much more interesting definition!<br/>Mwhahahahaha!</p><p>&gt;And I have certainly not thought of tempering as a way<br/>&gt;of making a chord possibly more clear.</p><p>That&apos;s Paul&apos;s idea (at least I haven&apos;t seen it elsewhere).

The diminished 7ths and augmented triads of<br/>12-equal being classic examples.</p><p>&gt;(Though sometimes I wish I was *not*<br/>&gt;hearing an implied fundamental and want to temper enough to get rid<br/>&gt;of it.)</p><p>Well, if you perturb the tuning of a chord enough to remove the<br/>implied fundamental, it&apos;s safe to say you&apos;ve got a different chord<br/>on your hands.  Finding chords with highly ambiguous fundamentals<br/>is something you can do with harmonic entropy, though they&apos;re<br/>usually quite discordant.  Find-the-fundamental isn&apos;t a game the<br/>ear quits often.</p><p>Chords without a base-2 on the bottom sometimes sound less rooted,<br/>since the implied fundamental is not actually being sounded.  Here<br/>you have to be careful to check both the bottom note of the entire<br/>chord and the bottom note of prominent dyads in the chord.  The<br/>5-limit minor triad for example is 10:12:15, but the outer 2:3<br/>usually makes the root pretty strong.</p><p>Then there are chords whose fundamental is ambiguous, but only<br/>between maybe 2 choices, and context can determine which you&apos;ll hear.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=48949 href="#48949">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2003 11:08:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote...</p><p>&gt;Finding chords with highly ambiguous fundamentals<br/>&gt;is something you can do with harmonic entropy, though they&apos;re<br/>&gt;usually quite discordant.</p><p>An exception might be high-limit utonal chords.

An AM<br/>tone consists of a complex<br/>comprising three successive harmonics that evokes a clear,<br/>unambiguous pitch at its (missing)<br/>fundamental frequency. When all three harmonics were shifted either<br/>upward or downward in<br/>frequency by the same amount, while keeping their frequency-spacings<br/>constant, the low pitch of<br/>the complex first shifted slightly by a much smaller amount than this<br/>frequency difference, an<br/>amount that was related to harmonic structure. When the frequencies<br/>were further shifted,<br/>listeners could hear one of two ambiguous pitches in the vicinity of<br/>the original pitch.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/cariani/CarianiWebsite/CarianiNP99.pdf">http://homepage.mac.com/cariani/CarianiWebsite/CarianiNP99.pdf</a></p></div><h3><a id=49002 href="#49002">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2003 2:07:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It&apos;s the *overall fundamental* which represents the frequency<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;periodicity, not the fundamentals of the individual pitches,<br/>let<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;along the harmonics.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, but periodicity detection is based on all stimuli (harmonics<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and all) *below about 4KHz.*.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;No, it&apos;s the periodicity that needs to be below 4KHz, not the<br/>&gt; &gt;frequencies of the components.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You have a source on this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>What&apos;s the source for what you were saying?
