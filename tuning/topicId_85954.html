What I did is just a &quot;photosonic disk&quot; of the logarithmic scale in a circle (= a horagram), with improved image periodicity through this fractal transformation.<br/>All what I know is that it doesn&apos;t changes the logic of the structure, and it shows how to find all possible edo subsets versions of Miracle temperaments.<br/>What I found is that the generator can be seen as an octave at a different scale, just like in an &quot;abyssal image&quot; (don&apos;t know if this translates well the french &quot;image en abime&quot;, an image that contains a picture of the whole image).<br/>In fact, in its pure fractal form, it&apos;s impossible to say if &quot;the octave&quot; is 1200 cents, or  116.6o105 c. or even 10.2915026221292 * 1200 = 12 349.803 cents !<br/>But let&apos;s say the octave is 1200 cents, that speaks better (it can also be extended for optimisation without problem).</p><p>The main basic division to retain of the octave here is :<br/>neutral third = 349.803 c.<br/>fifth = 699.606 c.<br/>neutral sixth (= octave less neutral third) = 850.197 c.<br/>octave  = 1200 c.<br/>And these have the same proportions as 33.9895 c., 67.979 c., 82.6115 c., and 116.601 c., that form the basic division of the generator, 116.601 c.</p><p>The 11/8 approximation has to be one &quot;double-fifth&quot; wholetone + one neutral third :<br/>= 199.2125 + 349.803 = 549.0155 c.<br/>It is attained by 4 generators + one fraction of a generator, equal to the proportion of the neutral sixth to the octave :<br/>(850.197 / 1200) *116.601 = 82.6115   &lt;error of 1 c. in my first message&gt;<br/>So &quot;11/8&quot;  =  4* 116.6o1 c. + 82.6115 c. =  549.0155 c.</p><p>If we express the intervals in 72-edo (which is also probably Miracle&apos;s most common use ?), the generator is<br/>72 / 10.2915026221292  = roughly 7 steps, divided  2 + 2  + 1  + 2  (or steps 2-4-5-7)<br/>The 11/8 will then be approximated by 4 * 7  + 5  = 33 steps.<br/>The Blackjack subset goes 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2,  or steps<br/>2-7-9-14-16-21-23-28-30-35-37-42-44-49-51-56-58-63-65-70-72<br/>It has no 33 steps from 1/1, it has 33 steps only in other places : between 2 and 35, 9 and 42, etc.<br/>The blackjack subset has no regular whole tone (199.2125 c.), nor the &quot;6/5&quot; approximation neither (315.8135 c.).<br/>31 and 41 subsets have all those.</p><p>Just tried your triads suggestions. Both sound strange, but may be I need more of the context !!<br/>It&apos;s quite limited to test such a temperament with a 12 keys keyboard of course, but still it&apos;s open.<br/>On my first test what striked me were the 7/6, I found them terrific !

But, I have a number of observations from my own experiences.</p><p>In Blackjack 11/8 shows up in hexads rather than in a JI harmonic scale kind of way, but not as often as 7/5 appears as an &quot;11th&quot;. So it is not a &quot;regular&quot; mapping in that way, or as regards to the minor thirds, which are mostly near-perfect 7/6s, and eight 6/5s mixed in. And consequently the 5/3s are scattered... basically, I see  the Blackjack &quot;scale&quot; as an ingenious way of  packing of as many near-perfect low-limit JI intervals as possible into a small space.</p><p>There is a huge amount to discuss here, it&apos;ll take some time (I&apos;m &quot;multitasking&quot; at the moment:-)) For example I have a spectral image clearly illustrating some very interesting things, present in you &quot;Shur&quot; scale as well as well as many other Phi tunings- and Blackjack- which you might dig.</p><p>Looking forward to hearing your new photosonic disc!</p><p>By the way, in English and Slovene, and I believe many other languages,  the expression for the larger-within-smaller... is mise en ab&icirc;me, directly from the French.  Or recursion in more scientific or &quot;scientific&quot; contexts. &quot;Turtles all the way down&quot; is another related expression, from the probably bogus, but funny, anectode of the Indian sage explaining cosmology.

You can represent 385/384 as [-7, -1, 1, 1, 1&gt; (2^-7 * 3^-1 * 5^1 * 7^1 * 11^1). If you multiply each element of &lt;1, 1, 3, 3, 2] by the corresponding element of [-7, -1, 1, 1, 1&gt; and add the results, you get 0; you get the same result with &lt;0, 6, -7, -2, 15]. In other words, the tempered equivalent of 385/384 is [0, 0&gt; : 0 periods + 0 generators. So, no matter what values you use for the size of the generators, the result is 0: the interval is tempered out.</p><p>This is also, in general, how you can find the tempered equivalent of any rational interval. Take 7/4 for instance: represent it as [-2, 0, 0, 1, 0&gt;, and do the multiplication (you can do this in a spreadsheet as a matrix multiplication), which gives you a result of [1, -2&gt;. So in miracle temperament, 7/4 is one octave up, 2 secors down.</p><p>|1  1  3  3  2|     |-2|     | 1|<br/>|0  6 -7 -2 15|  x  | 0|  =  |-2|<br/>                    | 0|<br/>                    | 1|<br/>                    | 0|</p></div><h3><a id=86264 href="#86264">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 3:58:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Waaoh !

So in<br/>&gt; miracle temperament, 7/4 is one octave up, 2 secors down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; |1 1 3 3 2| |-2| | 1|<br/>&gt; |0 6 -7 -2 15| x | 0| = |-2|<br/>&gt; | 0|<br/>&gt; | 1|<br/>&gt; | 0|<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=86272 href="#86272">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 8:36:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris wrote:<br/>&gt; So, with 31 edo it would be possible to approximate adaptive JI in a series of approximated mean tone tunings?<br/>I&apos;m not sure what you mean.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86273 href="#86273">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 8:45:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Petr,</p><p>It seems to me that one of the draw backs of adaptive JI is the complexity.</p><p>From what I gather in this conversation 31 EDO can come close to<br/>aproximating a number of mean tone tunings - and mean tone tunings all<br/>imitate JI but in a limited fashion</p><p>So....</p><p>A draw back of mean tone tunings is that modulation to far keys are messy or<br/>unusable.

In my oppinion, 31-EDO can be used as one particular version of meantone which has slightly wider fifths than quarter-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt; A draw back of mean tone tunings is that modulation to far keys are messy or unusable.<br/>Of course, if you have only 12 tones in an octave, then modulations are pretty limited in meantone. The usual historical choice was 2 flats to 3 sharps (i.e. from Eb to G#). But in some cases, there were variants like 1 flat to 4 sharps, or 3 flats to 2 sharps, or no flats and 5 sharps. And in other cases, there were instruments with split keys, which made it possible to have 17 or 19 tones in an octave. And in other cases, there were two 12-tone manuals with each manual managing a different part of the chain of fifths, making it possible to have as much as 24 tones in the scale (although I&apos;m not sure how easy or difficult it was to play the instruments).</p><p>&gt; BUT if one changed the mean tone tuning on the fly like adaptive JI<br/>&gt; then modulations far keys could be possible.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if each of us isn&apos;t incidentally meaning something else when saying &quot;adaptive JI&quot;. I would rather say that if you could somehow alternate between tuning D# and Eb even with a conventional 12-tone keyboard, you could play more distant modulations than with only D# or only Eb.</p><p>&gt; My question is then, in this context, can 31 EDO give a workable but less complex,<br/>&gt; means to implement a good approximation to adaptive JI by using<br/>&gt; a series of mean tone tuning approximations?</p><p>#1. Please, what&apos;s meant by &quot;a series of meantone tuning approximations&quot;?</p><p>#2. I think I should say a few more words about adaptive JI to make sure both of us mean the same thing. For example, let&apos;s say we want to play the harmonic progression of &quot;C major, A minor, D minor, G major, C major&quot; in pure 5-limit JI (i.e. major thirds of 5/4 and minor thirds of 6/5) and we want both the first and last chord to have the same pitch, although the latter C major would originally (i.e. in strict JI) be a syntonic comma lower if the common tones of consecutive chords are preserved. Actually, we can do this in two ways. One possibility is to raise one pitch by a syntonic comma in one of the chords . For example, you can use one D in the D minor chord and a slightly higher D in the G major chord. So in fact, by doing this, we&apos;re raising the pitch of G major and C major by a syntonic comma, when compared to the &quot;original&quot; JI version. But there&apos;s one more possibility. Instead of making one great pitch shift from one chord to another by a full comma, we can do four progressive quarter-comma pitch shifts within the entire chord progression. This is what adaptive JI is about. If I&apos;m not mistaken, its greatest promoter was the Italian Nicola Vicentino (in the later half of the 16th century) who devised an adaptive tuning by stacking two meantone chains tuned ~5.5 cents apart.

You named several keys such as<br/>&gt; 17/13, 20/19, 77/51, 14/13, 13/10, 20/17 etc. from approximation of<br/>&gt; &quot;higher-than-11&quot; -limit ratios, certainly because being simpler and<br/>&gt; closer to the intervals generated.<br/>&gt; I would try to understand something :<br/>&gt; If I take for example &quot;20/17&quot; (23 secors), which could be mapped also<br/>&gt; as &quot;33/28&quot; or &quot;88/75&quot; in 11-limit, am I correct if I say then that<br/>&gt; Miracle also dissolves their ratios with 20/17, which are 561/560 and<br/>&gt; 375/374 ?<br/>&gt; And same with 273/272 and 833/832 for the &quot;17/13&quot; approximation (as<br/>&gt; equivalent to 21/16 and 64/49)  ?</p><p>There is a scale of generators to the left that line up with the cross (or +) markings in the center of each key, so you can see how many generators (or secors) distant each ratio is from the origin, 1/1.  Since we are assuming octave equivalence, all powers of 2 are 0G (zero generators).  Each prime then maps to the following number of generators:<br/>3/2 or 3:  +6G<br/>5/4 or 5:  -7G<br/>7/4 or 7:  -2G<br/>11/8 or 11:  +15G<br/>13/8 or 13:  -34G<br/>17/16 or 17:  -30G<br/>19/16 or 19:  -18G</p><p>If you factor any ratio, such as 20/17 into 2*2*5/17, you can then add the number of generators corresponding to each factor (subtracting for factors in the denominator), 0+0-7+30=23G to get the number of secor generators for that ratio.  You can then test 33/28 (+6+15-0+2=23G) and 88/75 (+15-6+7+7=23G) to demonstrate that they are equivalent in 19-limit Miracle.  The mapping for prime 13 involves a choice between +34G and -38G, and I chose the former (you may disagree).</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=86295 href="#86295">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2010 6:43:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacques Dudon wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Herman,<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the answer !<br/>&gt; Except that for the demonstration I am lacking the necessary maths to &gt; understand your third line :<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you multiply each element of &lt;1, 1, 3, 3, 2] by the corresponding &gt;&gt; element of<br/>&gt;&gt; [-7, -1, 1, 1, 1&gt; and add the results, you get 0;</p><p>Just that (1 * -7) + (1 * -1) + (3 * 1) + (3 * 1) + (2 * 1) = 0.</p><p>&gt; and also in the end what is meant by &quot;multiplication&quot; :<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Take 7/4 for instance: represent it as [-2, 0, 0, 1, 0&gt;,<br/>&gt;&gt; and do the multiplication (you can do this in a spreadsheet as a<br/>&gt;&gt; matrix multiplication), which gives you a result of [1, -2&gt;.<br/>&gt;&gt; So in miracle temperament, 7/4 is one octave up, 2 secors down.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; |1 1 3 3 2| |-2| | 1|<br/>&gt;&gt; |0 6 -7 -2 15| x | 0| = |-2|<br/>&gt;&gt; | 0|<br/>&gt;&gt; | 1|<br/>&gt;&gt; | 0|</p><p>The column layout unfortunately got messed up in this example.

whose transpositions would be best suited to play this scale (that is, the 1 : 10 : 21 : 31 : 41 : 72 scale, not the Miracle scale), and its eventual octavial variations.<br/>Interpretation of this fractal waveform as an horagram defines the Meta-temperament, which resumes here to this precise octave/&quot;meta&quot;-secor ratio.</p><p>&gt; (Petr #2) : Didn&apos;t George himself suggest an optimal generator to &gt; be the 19th root of 18/5?<br/>&gt; Petr</p><p>18/5, attained by 19 secors it is certainly a very valuable approximation, and George Secor has certainly good reasons for it,<br/>but there are many others as you would very well know :<br/>7th root of 8/5  -&gt; 116.2409 cents<br/>8th root of 12/7  -&gt; 116.6411 cents<br/>12th root of 9/4  -&gt; 116.9925 cents<br/>15th root of 11/4  -&gt; 116.7545 cents<br/>(19th root of 18/5 -&gt; 116.7156 cents)<br/>(24/247 of an octave -&gt; 116.5992 cents, &quot;meta&quot;-secor = 116.60105 cents)<br/>Others will use different tempering criterias and weights to define &quot;optimal&quot; generators (TOP, etc.).<br/>I do not claim myself any particular acoustic quality to the &quot;meta&quot;-generator I suggested, not more than the golden scale could claim to be a better meantone than others, or I would be the first one to prove the contrary.<br/>But no other generator will have the fractal properties of a meta-generator and its main interest is in the infinity of valid series its algorithm generates, converging towards a specific H(n) / H(n-1) proportion, and that may be considered as some kind of &quot;gravity center&quot;

You named several keys such as<br/>&gt; &gt; 17/13, 20/19, 77/51, 14/13, 13/10, 20/17 etc. from approximation of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;higher-than-11&quot; -limit ratios, certainly because being simpler and<br/>&gt; &gt; closer to the intervals generated.<br/>&gt; &gt; I would try to understand something :<br/>&gt; &gt; If I take for example &quot;20/17&quot; (23 secors), which could be mapped &gt; also<br/>&gt; &gt; as &quot;33/28&quot; or &quot;88/75&quot; in 11-limit, am I correct if I say then that<br/>&gt; &gt; Miracle also dissolves their ratios with 20/17, which are 561/560 &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; 375/374 ?<br/>&gt; &gt; And same with 273/272 and 833/832 for the &quot;17/13&quot; approximation (as<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalent to 21/16 and 64/49) ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a scale of generators to the left that line up with the &gt; cross (or +) markings in the center of each key, so you can see how &gt; many generators (or secors) distant each ratio is from the origin, &gt; 1/1. Since we are assuming octave equivalence, all powers of 2 are &gt; 0G (zero generators). Each prime then maps to the following number &gt; of generators:<br/>&gt; 3/2 or 3: +6G<br/>&gt; 5/4 or 5: -7G<br/>&gt; 7/4 or 7: -2G<br/>&gt; 11/8 or 11: +15G<br/>&gt; 13/8 or 13: -34G<br/>&gt; 17/16 or 17: -30G<br/>&gt; 19/16 or 19: -18G<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you factor any ratio, such as 20/17 into 2*2*5/17, you can then &gt; add the number of generators corresponding to each factor &gt; (subtracting for factors in the denominator), 0+0-7+30=23G to get &gt; the number of secor generators for that ratio. You can then test &gt; 33/28 (+6+15-0+2=23G) and 88/75 (+15-6+7+7=23G) to demonstrate that &gt; they are equivalent in 19-limit Miracle. The mapping for prime 13 &gt; involves a choice between +34G and -38G, and I chose the former &gt; (you may disagree).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>That&apos;s what I thought, and it&apos;s open enough.

By &quot;in that way&quot;, I meant that 11/8 won&apos;t<br/>show up in each &raquo;fingering&laquo; in the Blackjack tuning (because Blackjack is a subset).</p><p>Specifically, I mentioned this because of the coincident<br/>discussion here on the list about set theory and regular<br/>temperament: in actual practice, a regular temperament is<br/>usually going to appear in a subset such as Blackjack. But<br/>applying set theory to a Blackjack tuning would create sets<br/>in which 56/55 would be tempered out on paper, but wouldn&apos;t<br/>be in the actual tuning. That is, you&apos;d have &quot;the same&quot;<br/>interval as far as number, but sometimes the actual<br/>sounding interval would be an 11/8, and usually it would be a 7/5.</p><p>Obviously, to some degree or other this discrepancy<br/>between number and actual tone is going to happen<br/>in any tuning without the symmetries to prevent it,<br/>of course.</p><p>&gt; Blackjack (20 times the generator, 21 tones) is certainly a nice<br/>&gt; subset, but is limited by a lack of &quot;9/8&quot; intervals (for example &gt;it&apos;s<br/>&gt; missing &quot;9/8&quot; over 1/1 in the symmetrical version) and in<br/>&gt; consequence, also a lack of &quot;6/5&quot; and &quot;11/8&quot;.<br/>&gt; The 31 tones version of Miracle is both more complete and more<br/>&gt; balanced. But every DE of Miracle (...10, 11, 21, 31, 41, 72) has &gt;its<br/>&gt; interest and for the harmonic relations it weaves, it is a &gt;fantastic<br/>&gt; and very open temperament (it&apos;s a unconditionnal JI addict that<br/>&gt; speaks ! ;-).</p><p>Yes the JI approximations are really excellent. I&apos;m very much<br/>on the record here as being  against considering intervals more than<br/>fewcents off as JI Â„approximations&quot;.

So you can then do &gt; some sort of &quot;comma shift imitation&quot; by playing something like C-G-&gt; C-D#, G#-G#-C-D#, C#-F-G#-C#, G-G-A#-D, C-G-C-D#.<br/>&gt; Petr</p><p>Cameron wrote :</p><p>&gt; In the &quot;regular temperament paradigm&quot; developed at this list over &gt; many years as far as I know, 22 wouldn&apos;t fall on that line because &gt; it does not &quot;temper out&quot; the syntonic comma. The syntonic comma &gt; remains there, in that view, between the intervals of 22-equal &gt; which are very close to 5/4 and 9/7. That is, there remains a comma &gt; between<br/>&gt; four-fifths-modulo-2 and 5/4, just as there does between four 3/2s &gt; and 5/4.<br/>&gt; They (regular mapping) regard 22 as a &quot;pajara&quot; temperament, which &gt; means in actual practice splitting the difference between 7/4 and &gt; fa-of-fa (16:9), but not splitting the difference between &gt; equivalents of Pythagorean ditones and Just M3s.</p><p>Hi Petr, and Cameron,</p><p>Thanks for your both precisions concerning 22-edo, which converge and make sense.<br/>I have to hear the &quot;comma shift imitation&quot; suggested by Petr.<br/>It makes sense that 22-edo would be considered mainly as a Pajara temperament, along with the &quot;two other side possibilities&quot; I mentionned.</p><p>Nevertheless, my comment was about the &quot;syntonic line&quot; that appears in a figure by Paul Erlich (and according to Carl, originally published by Herman Miller) :</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/DeviationsOfETsBelow100.gif">http://lumma.org/stuff/DeviationsOfETsBelow100.gif</a></p><p>It shows an alignment of edos between 7 and 12 on one side (7 - 26 - 19 - 50 - 31 -43 - 12 among others), and its natural continuation on the same (geometrical) line between 12 and 5, for what you call Petr &quot;superpyths&quot; (or what I call also &quot;extended fifths&quot;) and where Paul&apos;s graph included 17-edo and 5-edo.<br/>It&apos;s not what was mainly interesting me in it, but this remark here was : if this line (in the geometrical and logical sense) includes 17 and 5 , it must also pass by 22.<br/>(BTW 5 itself is coherent with the Golden scale series 5 7 12 19 31 50 etc. well present here and where we can see the perspective &quot;point de fuite&quot; of  this Golden series resized numbers, like if Phi was &quot;swallowing&quot; all these numbers...! ) -</p><p>Then the objection that 22&apos;s best approximation of 5/4 is not 8 but 7 steps would apply also to 17-edo, present in the figure, where four fifths of 10 steps lead to a 6 steps large major third, while a better approximation of 5/4 again would be 5 steps.<br/>But never mind that, the more interesting point here is that I was not refering to a &quot;meantone line&quot; but to a &quot;syntonic line&quot;, as two different things in my mind, and therefore there is a purely semantic question here I am asking :</p><p>Should &quot;syntonic fifths&quot; be synonymous of &quot;meantone fifths&quot;, or can they englobe extended fifths passed 700 cents ?</p><p>Some first importance searchers and luthiers under the term &quot;syntonic&quot; englobe fifths between 686 and 720 cents, that include 7, 53, 17, 22, and 5-edos :</p><p><a href="http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/software/TFSdocs/aboutdynamictonality.html">http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sethares/software/TFSdocs/aboutdynamictonality.html</a></p><p>My feeling is that 7-edo and 5-edo are the &quot;yin and yang&quot; extreme attractors of one global &quot;fifth&quot; entity, and in case &quot;syntonic&quot; was not a correct name for the line, another one would be welcomed.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=86703 href="#86703">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/19/2010 8:03:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacques Dudon wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Petr, and Cameron,<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your both precisions concerning 22-edo, which converge and &gt; make sense.<br/>&gt; I have to hear the &quot;comma shift imitation&quot; suggested by Petr.<br/>&gt; It makes sense that 22-edo would be considered mainly as a Pajara &gt; temperament, along with the &quot;two other side possibilities&quot; I mentionned.<br/>&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, my comment was about the &quot;syntonic line&quot; that appears in a &gt; figure by Paul Erlich (and according to Carl, originally published by &gt; Herman Miller) :<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/stuff/DeviationsOfETsBelow100.gif">http://lumma.org/stuff/DeviationsOfETsBelow100.gif</a></p><p>I did a chart of this sort, but not as detailed and much cruder (I believe it was a chart from a Microsoft Works spreadsheet).
