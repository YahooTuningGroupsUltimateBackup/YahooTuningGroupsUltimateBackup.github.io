It would be interesting to sort that<br/>graph out, but each vertex connects with 11 others, and the way major<br/>vertexes and minor vertexes look is no longer the same: both get<br/>connected by the eight edges [-1 0 0], [0 -1 0], [0 0 -1],<br/>[1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1], [0 -1 -1], [0 1 1]. However, the otonal<br/>verticies are connected to utonal also by [0 1 2], [0 2 1], [-1 2 2],<br/>whereas the utonal are connected to otonal also by [0 -1 -2],<br/>[0 -2 -1] and [1 -2 -2].</p><p>Anyway, it does work for 9-limit chords and I&apos;ve been using it for a<br/>long time now. Another example--you can take the 2x2x2 tetrad cube,<br/>aka the stellated hexany, and consider it as a quintad cube. The<br/>result is the 9-limit diamond, and you get two extra qunitads for<br/>free--[-1 1 1] representing 1-9/8-9/7-3/2-9/5, and [0 -2 -2],<br/>representing its inverse, 1-10/9-4/3-14/9-16/9.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2004 6:10:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Anyway, it does work for 9-limit chords and I&apos;ve been using it<br/>&gt;for a long time now.
