As a bassplayer (28) I am studying on a<br/>72-tone ET six-string Bassguitar.<br/>This instrument is fretted in thirdtones (18/Oct.ET) while the strings<br/>are tuned : X , X+1/12th-tone , X+1/6th-tone , X+1/4th-tone ,<br/>X+1/3rd-tone and X+5/12th-tones ( Based on the tuning-method of the<br/>96-tone Guitar ).<br/>I try to find a different string-tuning which creates a unique unequal<br/>scale on this Bass... Does anyone has suggestions?</p></div>
