<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>A simple trick - update</h1><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@idcomm.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2000 2:46:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A while back, I posted a 5- and a 7-limit retuning of the first movement<br/>of Schubert&apos;s piano sonata, D894, with only half the tuning correction<br/>from 12-tET as would be needed for strict JI.  This was TD 463.14.</p><p>Now, for comparison, using the new spring method, I&apos;m following up with<br/>some tunings that I think are improvements over that simple trick.  It<br/>is my hope that one or more of these will not irritate even the most<br/>sensitive ear, yet still offer at least some improvement over 12-tET.</p><p>   <a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p><p>Contained in <a href="http://d894-1s.zip">d894-1s.zip</a> are:</p><p>   Five-limit files:</p><p>      d894-1r5.mid: what I would consider my new 5-limit standard of<br/>                    reference.  Some relaxation of strict JI, but not<br/>                    much.<br/>      d894-1s5.mid: Softer springs in vertical tuning by a factor of<br/>                    1/4 of the original.<br/>      d894-1ss5.mid: Even softer springs in vertical tuning by a factor<br/>                    of 1/16 of the original.<br/>      d894-1sss5.mid: Even softer springs in vertical tuning by a factor<br/>                    of 1/64 of the original.</p><p>   Seven-limit files:</p><p>      d894-1r7.mid: what I would consider my new 7-limit standard of<br/>                    reference.  Some relaxation of strict JI, but not<br/>                    much.<br/>      d894-1s7.mid: Softer springs in vertical tuning by a factor of<br/>                    1/4 of the original.<br/>      d894-1ss7.mid: Even softer springs in vertical tuning by a factor<br/>                    of 1/16 of the original.<br/>      d894-1sss7.mid: Even softer springs in vertical tuning by a factor<br/>                    of 1/64 of the original.</p><p>   Original file:</p><p>      d894-1.mid:   Original and still champion 12-tET.</p><p>Because every note is sprung to ground, i.e., resists to some extent<br/>ANY deviation from 12-tET, the softer vertical tuning springs result in<br/>files only slightly modified from 12-tET.</p><p>What can I say about five vs. seven?  Make your own pick.  But if you<br/>want to get into seven gradually, work from sss7 up, stopping as<br/>necessary.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Clearly that is not what you are suggesting.</p></div>
