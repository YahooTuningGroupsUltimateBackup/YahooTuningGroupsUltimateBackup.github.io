What he says he means are meters like 3/10 and 7/24, based on unconventional groupings of quintuplets, triplets, and so on. These were first envisioned in Henry Cowell&apos;s 1919/1930 book New Musical Resources. I&apos;ve used them myself since 1985 (5/6, 17/24), and I suppose the earliest compositional use I&apos;ve seen (aside from Cowell&apos;s made-up examples) is in Boulez&apos;s Le Marteau - although these seem to have been changed to something more normal-loking in more recent editions.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting is that such &quot;rational&quot; meters (as all meters are, unless you want to try to dance an irrational waltz in pi/4) don&apos;t have any analogue in the kinds of E.T. pitch divisions Ferneyhough uses in his music. But they do have a direct analogue in the ratios of just intonation, which is how Cowell arrived at them in the first place, and why I&apos;ve used them myself. Ferneyhough&apos;s &quot;irrational&quot; meters correspond to a JI world that I&apos;m sure he has no idea of entering.</p><p>On more than one occasion I&apos;ve tried to convince representatives from Sibelius (the notation software) that it would be a great help to have access to meters with denominators other than powers of 2.

Do we need one dimension or the<br/>&gt;other to &quot;hold on to??&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s true, most of the time, I think. The one major work to go in both directions at once was Ben Johnston&apos;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; quartet, whose rhythms (like 35:36) are just as advanced as the pitch relationships, and analogous in every variation. I&apos;ve tried complexity in both directions, but I tend to be rhythmically complex in my Disklavier pieces, harmonically complex in my synthesizer pieces. I find it very difficult to do both at once.</p><p>Still, I have to say that one of my very favorite things about Partch&apos;s music is the casual way he&apos;ll subdivide quarter-notes into quintuplets and septuplets, or set up a catchy 9/4 pattern as he does in Castor and Pollux. He rarely does much nuance within the beat or meter, but he went further in terms of subdivisions than anyone of his generation except Carter - and with an infectious physicality that Carter never tried to match!</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2002 7:48:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; take Partch, for<br/>&gt; example, with complex JI and very simple rhythms</p><p>hmm . . . is 31/16 a simple rhythm? maybe i&apos;m confusing &quot;rhythm&quot;<br/>with &quot;meter&quot; . . .</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2002 9:57:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41426">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41426</a></p><p>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; take Partch, for<br/>&gt; &gt; example, with complex JI and very simple rhythms<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hmm . . . is 31/16 a simple rhythm? maybe i&apos;m confusing &quot;rhythm&quot;<br/>&gt; with &quot;meter&quot; . . .</p><p>***Hi Paul,</p><p>Well, no, but the effect is of a recurring beat.

The 50&apos;s are gone and the claim of this type of music with its supposed &apos;international &quot;style deserves the disinterest it was always met with, except by the &quot;Musical politics&quot; that shoved it at us.</p><p>It is music based on an isolationist arrongance that ignores the 99% of music on the globe and treats it like it doesn&apos;t exist, or at least without worth.</p><p>That this list had degenerated to a point where a request about a new recording of the Wayward is ignored and instead revels in such<br/>music that base is as far removed from intonation and pitch in general shows that what was once a door to new possibilities is headed for nothing more than &quot;old wine in new bottles&quot;. That old wine being nothing but vinegar in the first place.</p><p>    Ferneyhough is a greaty speaker and knows how like george bush to stay in the limelight.  All he has to do is write more complex music than anyone else, but underneath  all the flurries beyond our perceptable limits (play me something you remember of his music) he proves that such complexity is just as capable of shallowness. He uses many notes to say little.</p><p>    Recently i heard a piece by Boulez as apart of some horse torture circus (neither the horses or the performers looked at all happy) and one would think after all these years he would have learned to keep the audiences attention. As always he runs out of ideas after 7 minutes and unfortunately we were deprived the the visual of a music stand just to see how much longer we had to endure the same stuff over and over again.</p><p>  On the other hand to prove that i am not &quot;just someone who hates this stuff&quot;, i have found the new Scelsi disc of works of some larger strings groups quite wonderful. And memorable. and gee it is microtonal for those who like such things</p><p>    It almost seems this list is filled with people who don&apos;t like microtones. When was the last time we heard mentioned Niblock for instance. or  Pauline Oliveros, or any of the 90% of the world that uses microtonal music. Has the musical endeavor become the last refuge of some sort of cultural purity, that would rather rot than open it doors to world around us. Cage open the windows to the outside, the next step is to open to those living even further away.

This site is the first on the web devoted exclusively to this giant of modern music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A wealth of facts and resources, the site includes a biography of Joe&apos;s musical career, a detailed discography, a complete list of his composed works, scanned pages from scores, sound samples, and rare photos from many phases of Joe&apos;s career. Also, for the first time, all of Joe&apos;s works are being made available for sale or for rental through the site.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In addition, &quot;Preliminary Studies in The Virtual Pitch Continuum&quot;, written by Joe Maneri and Scott A. Van Duyne in 1990, is available for purchase from the Boston Microtonal Society. Modeled after some of Arnold Schoenberg&apos;s rigorous modes of study in his &quot;Preliminary Exercises in Counterpoint&quot;, the book leads students in the creation of 12 separate 4-note ascending microtonal melodies. Then, through subsequent lessons, students rearrange that material: adding voices to create harmonies, putting them to rhythm and by the end of the book, writing in 6-part microtonal counterpoint. You can view pages and hear examples from the book at <a href="http://www.joemaneri.com/publ.html">www.joemaneri.com/publ.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The site will be updated continuously in the months ahead.

Do we need one dimension or the<br/>&gt; &gt;other to &quot;hold on to??&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s true, most of the time, I think. The one major work to go in<br/>&gt; both directions at once was Ben Johnston&apos;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; quartet,<br/>&gt; whose rhythms (like 35:36) are just as advanced as the pitch<br/>&gt; relationships, and analogous in every variation. I&apos;ve tried<br/>&gt; complexity in both directions, but I tend to be rhythmically complex<br/>&gt; in my Disklavier pieces, harmonically complex in my synthesizer<br/>&gt; pieces. I find it very difficult to do both at once.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still, I have to say that one of my very favorite things about<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s music is the casual way he&apos;ll subdivide quarter-notes into<br/>&gt; quintuplets and septuplets, or set up a catchy 9/4 pattern as he does<br/>&gt; in Castor and Pollux. He rarely does much nuance within the beat or<br/>&gt; meter, but he went further in terms of subdivisions than anyone of<br/>&gt; his generation except Carter - and with an infectious physicality<br/>&gt; that Carter never tried to match!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yours,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kyle<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 15<br/>&gt;    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2002 03:30:08 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: ! middle-path 7-limit tetradic scales for kalle<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma &lt;clumma@y...&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It doesn&apos;t catch 4:5:6:7 and 7/(7:6:5:4), does it?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;umm . . . 4:6 = 5:7? you won&apos;t acheive that with rms below 20<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;cents, anyhow . . .<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Isn&apos;t it really 21:20 = 15:14?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;4:6 &quot;=&quot; 5:7, but that could be a chromatic unison vector, not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;necessarily a commatic one. thus there may very well be some<br/>&gt; viable<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;possibilities. excuse my error, i was sick when i wrote that (and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;i&apos;m still sick) . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course.

Nancarrow used<br/>&gt; tempos of e against pi in Study #40, and square roots and cube roots<br/>&gt; in Study #41. And in Studies 45-47 (originally a suite) he used one<br/>&gt; tempo layer made up of durations from a collection of unrelated<br/>&gt; tempos, for a recurring isorhythm that is truly irrational, or as<br/>&gt; close to such an experience as we can perceptually get.

The one major work to go in<br/>&gt; &gt; both directions at once was Ben Johnston&apos;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;<br/>quartet,<br/>&gt; &gt; whose rhythms (like 35:36) are just as advanced as the pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; relationships, and analogous in every variation. I&apos;ve tried<br/>&gt; &gt; complexity in both directions, but I tend to be rhythmically<br/>complex<br/>&gt; &gt; in my Disklavier pieces, harmonically complex in my synthesizer<br/>&gt; &gt; pieces. I find it very difficult to do both at once.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Still, I have to say that one of my very favorite things about<br/>&gt; &gt; Partch&apos;s music is the casual way he&apos;ll subdivide quarter-notes<br/>into<br/>&gt; &gt; quintuplets and septuplets, or set up a catchy 9/4 pattern as he<br/>does<br/>&gt; &gt; in Castor and Pollux. He rarely does much nuance within the beat<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; meter, but he went further in terms of subdivisions than anyone of<br/>&gt; &gt; his generation except Carter - and with an infectious physicality<br/>&gt; &gt; that Carter never tried to match!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yours,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Kyle<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>__<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>__<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Message: 15<br/>&gt; &gt;    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2002 03:30:08 -0000<br/>&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: ! middle-path 7-limit tetradic scales for kalle<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma &lt;clumma@y...&gt;&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It doesn&apos;t catch 4:5:6:7 and 7/(7:6:5:4), does it?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;umm . . . 4:6 = 5:7? you won&apos;t acheive that with rms below 20<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;cents, anyhow . . .<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Isn&apos;t it really 21:20 = 15:14?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;4:6 &quot;=&quot; 5:7, but that could be a chromatic unison vector, not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;necessarily a commatic one. thus there may very well be some<br/>&gt; &gt; viable<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;possibilities. excuse my error, i was sick when i wrote that<br/>(and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;i&apos;m still sick) . . .<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course.

Now that I see the music I remember that section, and I have a score of it around here somewhere.</p><p>Back to Ferneyhough: I attended a three-day (I think) seminar he gave on his music at the University of Chicago back in the &apos;80s, and interviewed him afterwards. At the seminar, he demonstrated how many things he had found to serialize in his music (Etudes Transcendantales, I think), *including* the angles at which the flutist held flute to her lips. There was actually a row that governed the mouthpiece angle. I never printed the interview, because when I paraphrased his views minus all the ever-so-polite Britishishms, what he was saying was that audiences were stupid, and only people willing to put years of work into his music deserved to listen to it. I couldn&apos;t make the interview sympathetic, and he would have just come off sounding like an uninteresting jerk.</p><p>Many years later I found myself on a panel with him in San Diego. He would redefine terms I used so that they fit in his system, and I realized that that&apos;s how he keeps his universe intact: he controls the definitions of all terms used so that everyone present is forced to talk within his system, and he can never be wrong. Only problem is, his discourse never actually relates to the outside world. Brilliant guy, like Boulez and all those guys: deeply arrogant, controlling, living in a world in which it is our duty, all the rest of us, to admire his music because he&apos;s managed to get in control. The Henry Kissingers and Donald Rumsfelds of composition.</p><p>Actually, I rather admire some of Ferneyhough&apos;s music while listening to it, it&apos;s so fanatically nuanced, so rich with detail. But I don&apos;t remember it afterward, never develop any affection for it, and don&apos;t yearn to hear it later, as I do with Partch&apos;s music. Strong as Kraig Grady&apos;s pronouncement is, I find nothing in it to argue with.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3>banaphshu &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E; &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2002 4:42:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;alternativetuning &lt;alternativetuning@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;alternativetuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Kraig wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is music based on an isolationist arrongance that ignores the<br/>&gt; 99% of music on the globe and treats it like it doesn&apos;t exist, or at<br/>&gt; least without worth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ferneyhough pays a lot of attention to the world&apos;s music.

This has a direct influence on the music scales used.<br/>These are long range pursuits that we are foolish to overlook. For instance one could or does have a scale where each tone is equally (or close to)<br/>disonant/consonant with every other tone in the scale. The result is free counterpuntal music with complete melodic freedom without restiction<br/>imposed by some harmonic limitation. Many gamelan scales fit this criteria and without it music constructed upon nuclear melodies would be<br/>impossible for such &quot;group&quot; compostions. If one wants to have a tuning against a drone where one wants to repeat the theme or limited scale without<br/>a strong cadence implied by the tuning- look at bagpipe tunings and you will not find harmonic series scales for this reason. the music dictates what<br/>the tuning is and these melodies have to be able to be repeated over and over again. These are simple examples of what is vastly complex and<br/>involves thinking about music in ways we are not used to especially when we confront those cultures far removed from our own . The how and whys<br/>of what they do things sometimes strike me of such inventiveness of lets say a boomerang. We know how to fly in machines but we didn&apos;t know how<br/>to do that and i am sure tunings right here right now are just as uncanny.</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2002 4:30:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; the most significant recent development in contemporary (complexist) music is<br/>&gt;&gt; that the Ferneyhoughs have failed to have any effect outside the ivory tower they exist in.<br/>&gt;&gt; Let him play on the street with a bucket in front of him at the UN and lets see what<br/>&gt;&gt; global absorption is. The 50&apos;s are gone and the claim of this type of music with its supposed &apos;international &quot;style deserves the disinterest it was always met with, except by the &quot;Musical politics&quot; that shoved it at us.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It is music based on an isolationist arrongance that ignores the 99% of music on the globe and treats it like it doesn&apos;t exist, or at least without worth.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That this list had degenerated to a point where a request about a new recording of the Wayward is ignored and instead revels in such<br/>&gt;&gt; music that base is as far removed from intonation and pitch in general shows that what was once a door to new possibilities is headed for nothing more than &quot;old wine in new bottles&quot;. That old wine being nothing but vinegar in the first place.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     Ferneyhough is a greaty speaker and knows how like george bush to stay in the limelight.  All he has to do is write more complex music than anyone else, but underneath  all the flurries beyond our perceptable limits (play me something you remember of his music) he proves that such complexity is just as capable of shallowness. He uses many notes to say little.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     Recently i heard a piece by Boulez as apart of some horse torture circus (neither the horses or the performers looked at all happy) and one would think after all these years he would have learned to keep the audiences attention. As always he runs out of ideas after 7 minutes and unfortunately we were deprived the the visual of a music stand just to see how much longer we had to endure the same stuff over and over again.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   On the other hand to prove that i am not &quot;just someone who hates this stuff&quot;, i have found the new Scelsi disc of works of some larger strings groups quite wonderful. And memorable. and gee it is microtonal for those who like such things<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     It almost seems this list is filled with people who don&apos;t like microtones. When was the last time we heard mentioned Niblock for instance. or  Pauline Oliveros, or any of the 90% of the world that uses microtonal music. Has the musical endeavor become the last refuge of some sort of cultural purity, that would rather rot than open it doors to world around us. Cage open the windows to the outside, the next step is to open to those living even further away. This is the real form of Global absorption going on.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Strong sentiments Kraig but in essence I agree. I was chatting with a PhD composition student who told me that his colleague had decided that the &quot;new complexity&quot; was where it &apos;s at and my heart sank. I thought that stuff was dead and buried. Mozart, who knew a thing or two, indicated three physical areas essential to successful composition, head, heart and ears. New complexity seems to me to ignore the last two of these in favour of the first.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps for today&apos;s world we need some &quot;new clarity&quot; in music.</p><p>Regards<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2002 7:13:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante.interport@r...&gt;</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41440">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41440</a></p><p> wrote:<br/>&gt; Joseph:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you can hear a few excerpts at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000000OB/qid=1039730866/sr=2-">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000000OB/qid=1039730866/sr=2-</a><br/>2/ref=sr_2_2/102-2185633-0180102<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; its enough to get the drift...<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thanks, Dante.

This has a direct influence on the<br/>music scales used.<br/>&gt; These are long range pursuits that we are foolish to overlook. For<br/>instance one could or does have a scale where each tone is equally<br/>(or close to)<br/>&gt; disonant/consonant with every other tone in the scale. The result<br/>is free counterpuntal music with complete melodic freedom without<br/>restiction<br/>&gt; imposed by some harmonic limitation. Many gamelan scales fit this<br/>criteria and without it music constructed upon nuclear melodies would<br/>be<br/>&gt; impossible for such &quot;group&quot; compostions. If one wants to have a<br/>tuning against a drone where one wants to repeat the theme or limited<br/>scale without<br/>&gt; a strong cadence implied by the tuning- look at bagpipe tunings and<br/>you will not find harmonic series scales for this reason. the music<br/>dictates what<br/>&gt; the tuning is and these melodies have to be able to be repeated<br/>over and over again. These are simple examples of what is vastly<br/>complex and<br/>&gt; involves thinking about music in ways we are not used to especially<br/>when we confront those cultures far removed from our own . The how<br/>and whys<br/>&gt; of what they do things sometimes strike me of such inventiveness of<br/>lets say a boomerang.

Originally a traditional non-hosted mailing list out of Mills College, it went through a couple of moves when Mills became unavailable until it landed on Yahoo (to be exact, I suppose, part of the moves were simply the hosting service being bought up).</p><p>Why mention this? There were times, in the history of the list, when one particular subject area grew to dominate discussion, much to the delight of some, to the chagrin of others. Never a place to achieve a true &quot;group consensus&quot;, enough of the participants in a given area decided that the high traffic (at that juncture) showed need for a separate area to discuss the subject, and an adjunct list was started. I still maintain that only a couple of lists are really active, and most of the people there knew why the list had sprung up and didn&apos;t spend a lot of time describing it (well, I&apos;ll make an exception for myself, as I put a fair amount of time into the planning of MMM, along with Margo and Jacky...). Most of them remain there today.</p><p>What about someone like you - what are you to think?</p><p>Pretty loony on one hand, fairly practical on another.

I just wanted to add that the sentence you wrote above is not<br/>correct.

This is one topic that I find interesting, but what list does<br/>it belong  on? And how far do we have to drift on the topic before we<br/>have switch  lists?<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I agree that this kind of discussion, as long as it involves<br/>microtonal material should be right here.</p><p>I wonder if Monz thinks that&apos;s OK??</p><p>best,</p><p>J.
