I agree with you Torsten but switching back and forth<br/>from ratios to cents and cents to ratios is a bit tedious. Alexander<br/>Ellis designed the &quot;1200cents to the octave system&quot; so that<br/>musicologists could accurately describe what they heard in the field.<br/>Well now the field is the whole world and creative musicians are not<br/>constrained by what the so-called experts tell them. Their only<br/>constraint is a whole cent as a part of 1200cents to the octave. Let<br/>creative musicians do what they do and if they come up with something<br/>significant then the mathematicians can analyse and interpret to<br/>their hearts&apos; content. I still think that 41tet would make a good<br/>universal music system but I am not so naive to think that that is<br/>the final word on the matter. I also think that the 128 partials of<br/>the 8th octave of the harmonic series has a lot of musical potential.</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2008 12:52:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert Thomas Martin wrote:</p><p>&gt; I agree that when it comes to problems<br/>&gt; associated with INITIAL CONDITIONS then the more decimal points the<br/>&gt; better.</p><p>It&apos;s nothing to do with decimal points.
