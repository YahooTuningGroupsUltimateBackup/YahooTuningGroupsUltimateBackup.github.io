At the end of<br/>this article I&apos;ll give links to some articles from 1999 that<br/>discuss this interval in detail, under the name of the &quot;lesser<br/>fifthtone&quot; of 1/4-comma meantone. But if I had known the term<br/>&quot;19-comma&quot; or &quot;19-diesis&quot; in 1999, I would have used it, and urge<br/>that we adopt and use it now.</p><p>In a meantone context, the 19-comma is the difference between 19<br/>fifths up and 11 octaves at 2/1. In 19-EDO, it&apos;s what gets<br/>tempered out.</p><p>More interestingly -- and this is why I learned about, although<br/>not under the useful name of &quot;19-comma,&quot; back in 1999 -- it&apos;s an<br/>interval which in meantones around 1/4-comma or the almost<br/>identical 31-EDO can be used as a very small melodic step or<br/>diesis, as composers such as Vicentino and Colonna did on their<br/>31-note circulating meantone keyboards in their &quot;enharmonic&quot;<br/>styles emulating the Greek enharmonic genus.</p><p>In these tunings, as you observe in your question, the chromatic<br/>semitone gets divided in a 31-note circulating tuning into an<br/>enharmonic diesis or 12-diesis -- a rational 128:125 or 41.059<br/>cents in 1/4-comma meantone -- and a 19-diesis, which in<br/>1/4-comma has a slightly smaller size of 34.990 cents.</p><p>In 31-EDO, the 12-diesis and 19-diesis are precisely equal, at<br/>1/31 octave or 38.710 cents, and are literally fifthtones, that<br/>is one-fifth the size of the regular major second at 5 steps.</p><p>In 1/4-comma, the 12-diesis and 19-diesis steps are slightly<br/>unequal, as we&apos;ve seen, but can still serve as approximately<br/>equal &quot;fifthtone&quot; steps.</p><p>However, having both these fifthtone steps large enough to sound<br/>like diesis steps rather than commas in the sense of not so<br/>melodically distinct is a contrast on meantone tunings meant to<br/>realize the enharmonic style presented in the treatises of<br/>Vicentino (1555) and Colonna (1618). Here&apos;s a Portuguese organ<br/>piece, I would guess maybe from Colonna&apos;s era, using these<br/>fifthtone steps, and realized in 1/4-comma:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Coimbra48.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>From the viewpoint simply of optimizing 5/4 and 6/5, one person<br/>might prefer 1/4-comma and another 2/7-comma, for example, But if<br/>want to realize Vicentino&apos;s fifthtone or enharmonic music, which<br/>depends on the division of the chromatic semitone into two equal<br/>or near-equal steps, that takes 2/7-comma off the table, since<br/>there we get a nice enharmonic diesis or 12-diesis at 50.276<br/>cents, but a 19-comma at only 20.397 cents, which add up to the<br/>chromatic semitone at a just 25/24 (70.672 cents).</p><p>Obviously a 20-cent step is too small for a Vicentino diesis or<br/>fifthtone step, so the tempering has to be a lot less than<br/>2/7-comma.</p><p>But getting back to our 19-comma, I&apos;d say that that&apos;s the general<br/>term, and one that fits especially well for 2/7-comma or the like<br/>where the size of 20 cents does fit our idea of a typical<br/>&quot;comma.&quot;</p><p>However, for a tuning like 1/4-comma or 31-EDO, where both the<br/>12-comma and 19-comma are in fact what we&apos;d call small dieses<br/>around 35-41 cents, why not speak of the 12-diesis and 19-diesis?<br/>Whether to say 19-comma or 19-diesis might best be left to the<br/>discretion of the writer, but with it understood that these are<br/>musically equivalent terms for the same interval.</p><p>Now for the links I promised, again with the advice that my<br/>&quot;lesser fifthtone&quot; be renamed the 19-comma, or in this context<br/>better yet 19-diesis. The second part, #5621, is of special<br/>interest here in terms of addressing this interval in 1/4-comma.</p><p>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_5609.html#5609">/tuning/topicId_5609.html#5609</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_5621.html#5621">/tuning/topicId_5621.html#5621</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_5646.html#5646">/tuning/topicId_5646.html#5646</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_5670.html#5670">/tuning/topicId_5670.html#5670</a>&gt;</p><p>With many thanks for a great question,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105112 href="#105112">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2012 12:22:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Oct 22, 2012 at 11:43 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Put another way:<br/>&gt; &gt; Minor second = diatonic semitone, if you temper this out you get 5-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; Augmented unison = chromatic semitone, if you temper this out you get 7-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; Diminished second = diesis, if you temper this out you get 12-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; Double diminished second = ?????????, if you temper this out you get 19-EDO<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Except the positive interval is a doubly augmented seventh, down an octave.</p><p>For some tunings of meantone.

At the end of<br/>&gt; this article I&apos;ll give links to some articles from 1999 that<br/>&gt; discuss this interval in detail, under the name of the &quot;lesser<br/>&gt; fifthtone&quot; of 1/4-comma meantone.

This is a comma<br/>absolutely critical to my own use of this region since the year<br/>2000, since it&apos;s the difference between 19683/16384 and 63/52 --<br/>and also between 2187/2048 and 14/13, for example.</p><p>From the view of isoharmonic chords, a good example might be the<br/>difference between the octave-less-apotome at 4096/2187, only a<br/>3-5 schisma smaller than 15/8, and 13/7. Thus even a regular<br/>12-MOS of the HTT generator would include good approximations of<br/>7:11:13 (e.g. E-C-Eb).</p><p>In HTT, of course, we have specifically a generator of 3/2<br/>tempered wide by (28672/28431)^1/9, or 1.624 cents, for a pure<br/>63/52 -- which, to my knowledge, might be the earliest example of<br/>tempering out this comma so as to produce a defining just<br/>interval (like 5/4 in 1/4-comma meantone, 16/15 in 1/5-comma,<br/>etc.).</p><p>Therefore I hereby propose that the 28672/28431, equal to the sum<br/>(or actually product) of 896/891 and 352/351, be dubbed the<br/>Secorian comma, or comma of Secor -- unless, of course, we know<br/>of an earlier temperament like this.</p><p>&gt;  With the addition of 5&apos;s it becomes a rank-4 temperament, for<br/>&gt;  which I tune 1:2, 1:5, and 1:7 exact.

In tunings with the fifth being sharp of 31-EDO, this interval is larger than the usual meantone diesis, whereas in tunings flat of it, it&apos;s smaller. If you go flat enough to go past 19-EDO, then this interval reverses in size, so that it becomes negative (this is the case in 26-EDO, for instance). So it&apos;s hard to assign a canonical size to this interval.</p><p>We could arbitrarily pick some optimal tuning - TOP meantone, or POTE meantone, or 1/4-comma meantone or 31-EDO or something, but I&apos;d rather just pick a name that&apos;s size agnostic. But I note that one JI ratio that tempers down to this interval class is the 5-limit kleisma of 15625/15552 tempers down to this, which is why I suggested just calling it the meantone kleisma.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to weigh in,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105307 href="#105307">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2012 2:39:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [George wrote:]<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; The HTT tunings that I&apos;ve described (in various messages) are<br/>&gt; &gt; constant-structure mappings of sets of the 15-limit 4-D<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament into a 17-, 29-, and 41-tone octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And great ones, as well as your Zany tuning and a fascinating<br/>&gt; 12-note set in JI from this January that I got a kind of 15+4 set<br/>&gt; out of, and would love to share with you.</p><p>Margo, I&apos;ll get back to you about this very soon.
