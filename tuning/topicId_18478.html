Last I remember,<br/>&gt; QuickTime used its own soft synth.  Winamp does too, unless the<br/>&gt; SoundBlaster FM synth is a lot better than I remember it ...</p><p>Yes, pretty sure, because the port is unavailable to FTS while QuickTime is<br/>running, and becomes available when it exits.</p><p>The older SBs used FM synths, as you say, but the modern SB Live!<br/>is pretty good, with three synths, one of which is wave table (and<br/>I&apos;m not sure what the others are, not as good as the wave table<br/>one).</p><p>When you change the default port in MIDI mapper, the relevant<br/>port becomes unavailable to FTS.</p><p>The one I&apos;m using is the QuickTime Plug-in 4.1.2 (as listed in Netscape<br/>| Help | About Plug Ins)</p><p>-----------------<br/>N.B. anyone know how to disable a plug in in Netscape? I don&apos;t always<br/>want to use the QuickTime one, as it opens the midi clip into the same<br/>window, so you lose the web page, unless you choose Open in new<br/>window. But I want to keep it for testing, as many Netscape users must<br/>have it.<br/>-----------------</p><p>However, that&apos;s actually given a clue for how to find out what is happening.</p><p>I have ports LB1, LB2 etc installed using Hubi&apos;s Loopback, which can<br/>be used to hook the MIDI out of any program to the MIDI in of another, and if i<br/>select those in MIDI mapper, quicktime goes silent.</p><p>So what I&apos;ll do is send the MIDI out of Quicktime to LB1, and then use that<br/>to make a commented hex dump of it in FTS.</p><p>Should then be able to work out what is happening exactly!</p><p>The modern SB Live! wave table synth has good relative pitch resolution,<br/>of about 0.2 cents, and the possibility of using ones own sound fonts, with<br/>default libraries of 4 and 8 Mb. It uses RAM of p.c. for the sound fonts,<br/>but that isn&apos;t so much of a problem nowadays.</p><p>One can make ones own sound fonts for it (though I haven&apos;t yet gone<br/>into that aspect), or download ones that other people have made.</p><p>It&apos;s a good example of a reasonable modern soundcard, though of course<br/>not superlative quality. Doesn&apos;t support some of the controllers, for example.<br/>But means I get a pretty good idea of what FTS will sound like to many<br/>users. I&apos;ve been pretty happy with it so far for my requirements, and can<br/>always use a softsynth if necessary, for controllers it doesn&apos;t support,<br/>via Hubi&apos;s loopback.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18479 href="#18479">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2001 6:22:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Graham,</p><p>Just discovered, Quicktime is configurable via the control panel.</p><p>You can choose to use its own synth, or General Midi.</p><p>I&apos;d got GM selected. So that explains that...</p><p>Bassoon piano still sounds strange on its own synth though.</p><p>The way out of tune partials are a bit quieter, but still there.</p><p>Of course one is expecting slightly detuned partials as it is piano timbre,<br/>but these are way out.</p><p>Anyway, will prob.find out exactly what is happening, once<br/>I&apos;ve done the hex dump and had a good look at it.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
