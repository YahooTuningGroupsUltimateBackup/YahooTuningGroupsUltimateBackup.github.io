Critic Heinz-Klaus<br/>Metzger, who came up with the idea for the performance, was inspired by<br/>Partch&apos;s phrase &quot;Fatal Day in Halberstadt&quot;.  The title of the piece, taken<br/>from _Finnegans Wake_, was intended by the composer to be interpreted as &quot;as<br/>slow as possible&quot;.  Accordingly, the piece, which begins with a rest, will<br/>actually start sounding aloud in some two years time.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt-am-Main</p></div>
