Not sure what&apos;s going on here...</p><p>BL :<br/>&gt; Why hit only near a 7:6 or a 9:7 when you can hit<br/>&gt; directly on one of them?</p><p>Why indeed? Well, because:</p><p>&gt; because those (2/7 comma) 3rds aren&apos;t pure, they&apos;re (arguably) more<br/>attractive<br/>&gt; just by virtue of being livelier, not sitting there dead-on.</p><p>Clear? Slightly tempered thirds are (Brad clearly wants to say) more<br/>attractive, but pure septimals are more desirable. But -</p><p>&gt; Every listener might of course have a different opinion about that.</p><p>Every listener might even change his or her opinion within five<br/>minutes about whether slightly tempered intervals were preferable to<br/>pure ones.</p><p>But that&apos;s not so important. The point, without getting too far into<br/>the details of exactly which intervals are better pure and which are<br/>better slightly tempered, is that without doing anything irregular we<br/>can create a large number of only slightly tempered - that is,<br/>recognisably near-pure - intervals, at the cost of only doing violence<br/>to 3/2.</p><p>In the regime near 1/4 or 2/9 comma or 31EDO we get the pure 7:5 and<br/>7:4 as aug4 and aug6. If we go to the &apos;other side&apos; of 1/4-comma, near<br/>2/7-comma or 50EDO, the 7:5 gets rather flat, but we get a good 7:6<br/>instead and a tolerable 9:7. It depends what one is keener on, out of<br/>tritones, aug 6&apos;s, aug 2&apos;s (alias subminor) and dim 4&apos;s (alias<br/>supermajor). Some time ago I tuned my best shot at 2/7 comma - not<br/>something that can be done very systematically by ear - and the purity<br/>of 7:6 was immediately obvious. Regular tuning that aims for the least<br/>error of 5-limit thirds has the bonus of doing very well by the<br/>7-limit thirds.</p><p>Not that keyboard music of the relevant period will be using the<br/>distant thirds (Bb-Db, F#-A#) very much, or even at all - but the<br/>septimal aug2 and dim4 can turn up relatively often in the role of<br/>dissonances.</p><p>Here&apos;s a relevant calculation that TU are particularly messy at<br/>dealing with, if they can even be used at all:<br/>What is the temperament of the fifth in a regular meantone such that<br/>F-G# is a pure 7:6?</p><p>Answers in any comprehensible form.<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=74166 href="#74166">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2007 10:05:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Some time ago I tuned my best shot at 2/7 comma - not<br/>&gt; something that can be done very systematically by ear -</p><p>Hi Tom-</p><p>Are you familiar with</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_59873.html#59873">/tuning/topicId_59873.html#59873</a></p><p>?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
