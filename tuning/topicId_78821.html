I&rsquo;ve come up with a definition of consonance and a way to measure consonance. If you are deep into the study of just intonation and you like to scratch and think you will get a lot out of this cite. My material is all original and copyrighted. I would be very interested in knowing whether or not it is a published first. I can&rsquo;t imagine that it is a literal first in terms of who did it first. I know it was done before. It is a re-creation of the wheel, so to speak.</p></div><h3><a id=78822 href="#78822">ðŸ”—</a>Killian-O&#x27;Callaghan Residence &#x3C;gottharddanae@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2008 5:00:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[ Attachment content not displayed ]</p></div><h3><a id=78829 href="#78829">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Bernard &#x3C;bjosephmex@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2008 5:33:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, you can compare the consonance of one chord with another chord!&nbsp; The starting point is to have a definition of consonance in the first place.&nbsp; I rather doubt that you will be able to do that elsewhere.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Hi Joseph,<br/>I am sure people out here like to reinvent wheels if the wheel has new<br/>features, like goes less bumpety bump, or is in other ways connected to<br/>roundness or un-squareness.
