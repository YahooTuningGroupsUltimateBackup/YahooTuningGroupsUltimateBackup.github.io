It&apos;s the first third or so of the<br/>22 tet guitar reduction of Just Vespers, the score of which I uploaded<br/>last week. In their magnanimity, my ISP grants me 5 whole megabytes of<br/>space so I have to take off the scores to make way for the soundfiles.<br/>Never mind - I&apos;ll have a CD made up soon. You might find that the file<br/>format  .bin can only work with Macs.</p><p>I used Fetch to upload the mp3 and I have the further choices of formats<br/>&apos;raw data&apos; and &apos;binhex&apos; for uploading. I tried raw data but on testing<br/>the download I got a large page of text, probably raw data in<br/>otherwords. Any suggestions as to how best to upload the mp3s would be<br/>welcome as I have a few pieces that might be of interest. Here&apos;s the<br/>snippet I put up today.</p><p><a href="http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3/JVguitsnip.mp3.bin">http://homepages.which.net/~alison.monteith3/JVguitsnip.mp3.bin</a></p><p>Best Wishes</p></div>
