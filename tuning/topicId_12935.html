It&apos;s what I had supposed and why I wanted precision. Now, I would<br/>&gt;like to discuss about that. It seems to me an artefact. Because (3 1 5 13)<br/>&gt;chord is on long descending slope of &quot;total discordance&quot;, it is not weakly<br/>&gt;deformed but eliminated. It falls in (9 3 15 5) chord. Tone 13/12 is masked<br/>&gt;by 10/9 tone. I tend to consider this distance quite large.</p><p>A true chordal harmonic entropy would probably have different results -- it<br/>would probably have a local minimum at 6:8:10:13 as well as one at<br/>9:12:15:20.</p></div>
