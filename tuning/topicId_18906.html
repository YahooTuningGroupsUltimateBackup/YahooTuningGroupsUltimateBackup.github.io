They performed<br/>here in SD, in Los Angeles (and San Fran?) and went to the (1999)<br/>Bang On A Can series, where they performed a Xenakis marathon. He<br/>said they rented most of the equip in NY, but had a bitch of a time<br/>transporting the sixxen back there. They utilized lengths of square<br/>aluminum tubing, and I can tell you from seeing/hearing it twice they<br/>were LOUD.</p><p>Don&apos;t know if it ever got released, but they recorded in the studio,<br/>at UCSD, all the 6 player perc pieces that X wrote for percussion<br/>(originally for the Percussion Groupe Strousberg), and mixed it in<br/>the new Dolby surround (5.1 maybe?) to be made into a DVD-audio disc.<br/>I heard one of the mixes in surround, and it was just like when I was<br/>at the live show: sitting in the theater, surrounded by six<br/>percussion setups.</p><p>I&apos;ll report back with info if I find out from him.</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=18909 href="#18909">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2001 5:23:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David!<br/>    Yes it is a really nice piece and my liner notes says quarter and<br/>third notes but that is all!</p><p>David Beardsley wrote:</p><p>&gt; This afternoon I picked up a copy of Pleiades by Iannis Xenakis.<br/>&gt; In the liner notes, IX describes a tuned percussion instrument<br/>&gt; called the Sixxen.
