There were<br/>&quot;gaps&quot; on both sides on the 1/1. You can look at his book (i can&apos;t get to it<br/>at the moment) to see how he filled this with Superparticular ratios (a<br/>subject completely lost to the ET perspective). This caused each interval to<br/>be subtended by the same number of steps except when passing over the 11/10<br/>and 10/9 area. HE WAS THINKING ALONG MOS LINES BY EAR!!!!<br/>Wilson Keyboard Layout not only shows how this scale can be placed on<br/>Bosanquet Keyboard but shows how Partch was thinking/hearing in a 41 tone<br/>scale with two variables. This is basic MOS procedure, you can see the same<br/>thing in Dallesandro where two pitches fall on the same key. This leaves the<br/>option up to the artist how he wishes to deal with it (if you want to use the<br/>keyboard)<br/>First of all the you could have the option to place one of the keys down<br/>below which is not ideal. You can have one pitch in one octave and one in the<br/>other. You could which I am sure, would be the only possible option to too<br/>many, if they were close enough you could temper these two pitches. When I<br/>had built the 31 tone marimba by Stephen Smith to encompass the  36 tone<br/>1-3-5-7-9-11 CPS, Certain intervals appeared in only one octave. The harmonic<br/>hexad below and the subharmonic hexad above. there where two intervals in the<br/>middle of the marimba that where separated by 4.5 cents, well considering how<br/>very short decay this instrument was, I split the difference. Wilson left<br/>this Artistic choice up to the artist.<br/>    All tuning systems require one to choose the balance between the melodic<br/>and the harmonic. The diamond by itself is incomplete, and Partch filled it<br/>out with his ear in his particular way. It is no way the only solution. I<br/>recomend to every one on this list to take the diamond and place it on the 41<br/>tone keyboard and proceed to fill in the keyboard blanks. These are the<br/>skills i learned  real early in working with microtones. Like microtonal 1st<br/>grade.  The &quot;filling in of the blanks&quot; gives the artist the ability to define<br/>unique areas of harmonic/melodic push and pull that might be their own.<br/>    It is on this balance of harmony and melody that i will still stand<br/>behind the worth of my 12 tone scale Centaur. True you can come up with more<br/>than the tetrads found within this scale, but frankly those solutions ignored<br/>the melodic side of the scale. The proof is in the pudding though, and that<br/>little scale kept me happy for years without exhausting it. Other scales can<br/>do this too, but that is the criterion!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=7422 href="#7422">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
