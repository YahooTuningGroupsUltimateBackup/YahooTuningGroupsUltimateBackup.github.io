He<br/>agreed and so I will put it up for you and all to see shortly.</p><p>BTW There are 2 Augusto Novaro Books, one which was discovered by accident by Mark Rankin who went<br/>to the Library of Congress and asked for one and was given the second. They both share the same<br/>Library of Congress Call number # ML 3805 N69</p><p>One is called<br/> Sistema Natural base del Natural- Aproximado. 1927</p><p>The other<br/>Sistema Natural De La Musica. 1951</p><p>Both in Spanish but the language of Ratios explains quite a bit.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m currently studying the way that the eikosany and diamond overlap &amp;<br/>&gt; intersect. Facinating stuff !</p><p>yes to have two diamonds distanced on opposite tones of an eikosany forming an eikosany has always<br/>appealed to me. But maybe you had something else in mind</p><p>P.S. Erv also is having me put up a scale included in what was mailed to you.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
