Why? His whole point was that the dissonance was proportional to d<br/>&gt;WHEN THE FRACTION IS IN LOWEST TERMS. This is also true for n+d.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What we are suggesting here is that the dissonance is related to the period<br/>&gt;(inverse of frequency) of the virtual fundamental (VF). When the ratio for<br/>&gt;an interval is in lowest terms, the VF corresponds to a 1.</p><p>Right, this makes sense.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>&gt;If instead we fix the average frequency of the two notes at 450Hz. The<br/>&gt;notes of a 3:2 will be 360Hz and 540Hz and the VF will be 180Hz (period<br/>&gt;5.56ms), while the notes of a 5:4 will be 400Hz and 500Hz and the VF will<br/>&gt;be 100Hz (period 10ms). Periods are proportional to n+d or (n+d)/2.</p><p>This makes sense too.  I wonder what Paul E&apos;s derrivation is.  BTW, my idea<br/>behind n*d is to measure the period of the VF in terms of the periods of<br/>the fundamentals of the notes in the dyad, rather than the clock time.</p><p>[Keenan]<br/>&gt;If we want to talk about the realtive dissonance of intervals (or chords<br/>&gt;for that metter) without considering frequency, then the only sensible<br/>&gt;thing to do is to compare them all with the same average frequency, hence<br/>&gt;n+d or (n+d)/2 is the right approximation for dyads, not d.</p><p>Sticking to dyads just for a moment, I&apos;m not sure how considering the fixed<br/>frequency to be the average of n and d improves anything over assuming<br/>either n or d to be fixed.  That is, if we need to specify frequency, don&apos;t<br/>we need to specify frequency?</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;&gt;How so?  One dimension for every odd factor.  Or as you say, the (odd<br/>&gt;&gt;limit minus one) over two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, but the odd limit would have to be specified in advance.</p><p>When not?  Harmonic limit seems such a fundamental part of how we hear<br/>music, and of what music in turn does to oblige.</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;&gt;Only up to the point you&apos;ve declared consonant!  The problem with your<br/>&gt;&gt;algorithm is it has no way to measure intervals outside of those you<br/>&gt;&gt;declare consonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, if you are allowed to declare an odd limit for consonance, it<br/>&gt;_can_ measure intervals that are composites of consonant intervals<br/>&gt;(using the lattice)</p><p>But not always by the shortest route, as Paul Hahn showed.</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;&gt;Hence (n+d)/2.  Is this an incorrect generalization for dyads?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m still not following you.</p><p>Uh...</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt;Well, if you weight by prime or odd limit like you said, then the 2 will<br/>&gt;never come into the weighting of any intervals</p><p>2 is prime.</p><p>C.</p></div>
