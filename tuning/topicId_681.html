On the subject of using colorful words to describe people&apos;s<br/>art, I don&apos;t have a problem with that...growing up in St. Louis, I<br/>learned really funky talk at a tender age, and I still can use it<br/>fluently. When Lumma says something sucks, I think I get the<br/>picture...he reallyreally doesn&apos;t like it...pretty simple. On that<br/>subject, here&apos;s a quote from Miles Davis&apos;s autobiography, where he&apos;s<br/>talking about opening for the Steve Miller band (p 301)...&quot;Anyway, Steve<br/>Miller didn&apos;t have shit going for him, so I&apos;m pissed because I got to<br/>open for this non playing motherfucker just because he had one or two<br/>sorry assed records out.&quot; Miles was definitely one of the 20th century&apos;s<br/>greatest musicians, and was extremely intelligent, but talked that St.<br/>Louis street talk really well...his critique of Miller is pretty<br/>straightforward, I would say, and doesn&apos;t need any sort of explanation<br/>to understand it. On p. 102, he also refers to Bird as &quot;outrageous,&quot; and<br/>a &quot;bad motherfucker&quot;...again, I understand what he&apos;s saying...he thinks<br/>he&apos;s a great musician.<br/>    I think when one critiques another&apos;s work, it doesn&apos;t matter if you<br/>like it or not...the important thing, for me, is to leave personality<br/>out of it. I have had friends tell me point blank that they did not<br/>certain pieces of mine....but, who cares, because they were not saying<br/>they didn&apos;t like me as a human...who I am as a human was not the issue.<br/>I don&apos;t care if someone likes my music, because we are all different<br/>emotionally and spiritually, and I don&apos;t think for a minute that my view<br/>of music will be identical to everyone else&apos;s...mutual respect is the<br/>key when reviewing someone&apos;s art. With the forum CD, it was interesting<br/>to me how some of the pieces that I did not care for, were other<br/>people&apos;s favorites...that&apos;s life.<br/>   On the subject of critiques, I did not care for Terry Riley&apos;s music<br/>the first time I heard it (about 1971)...it was a Rainbow in Curved Air.<br/>I heard Shri Camel, and didn&apos;t like it either...no biggie, I&apos;m sure he&apos;s<br/>a fine feller, but it ain&apos;t my type of music. Again, who cares...for all<br/>you folks who do like it, you have your reasons. I only have a problem<br/>when musical criticism degenerates into personal attacks...that&apos;s a nono<br/>in my book. For the most part, the forum has been a pretty peaceful<br/>place, and I have a lot of respect for most of the participants, even if<br/>we don&apos;t see eye to eye on personal likes and dislikes...that&apos;s what<br/>makes life interesting...Hstick</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/1999 11:44:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; On the subject of using colorful words to describe people&apos;s<br/>&gt; art, I don&apos;t have a problem with that...</p><p>   On that subject, I&apos;d like to recommend a book that, despite its rather<br/>dry, scholarly-sounding title, is really a screaming riot to read.  I&apos;m not<br/>sure if it&apos;s still being printed, but its entitled, &quot;Lexicon of Musical<br/>Invective&quot; by Nicklaus Slonimsky, on the University of Washington press.<br/>It is a collection of scathing reviews by contemporaries of what are now<br/>considered *classic* works of musical art.  I especially enjoy the quotes<br/>about Beethoven.  One that I can&apos;t forget goes something like,</p><p>     There is much to admire in Beethovens &quot;heroic&quot; symphony, but it<br/>     is difficult to keep up such admiration for three long quarters<br/>     of an hour.  If it is not somehow abridged, it will soon fall<br/>     into disuse.</p><p>BZZZZZZZZZTT!

Gary is absolutely right... I would add that it&apos;s a<br/>one-volume lesson in humility for those who are quick to judge the<br/>creations and tastes of others simply on the basis of their own personal<br/>creations and tastes, no matter how unquestionably refined and brilliant<br/>the latter.  Here&apos;s a brilliant London reviewer from 1856:</p><p>&quot;In certain of Dr. Schumann&apos;s Variations for two pianofortes, the<br/>harmonies are so obtrusively crude that no number of wrong notes would be<br/>detected by the subtlest listener.&quot;</p><p>[Perhaps the pianos weren&apos;t properly tuned ;-)]</p><p>For me there are two kinds of critiques (and I enjoy both very much, but<br/>for different reasons).  These are characterized in the following quotes<br/>(only a few of the thousands).</p><p>1. Random (and usually ignorant) mud-slinging -- sometimes called by its<br/>technical term &quot;food fight&quot;:<br/>&#x9;&quot;... negative criticism, because it lacks generative power, is<br/>wrong ninety times out of a hundred....&quot; (Schoenberg)  [Of course AS slung<br/>some mud of his own, but *usually* it was defensive mud]<br/>&#x9;&quot;... the tried and tested cliches for the tried and tested<br/>feelings&quot; (Adorno)<br/>&#x9;&quot;You are like a porcupine.  When that animal has its spines erect,<br/>it cannot eat.  If you do not eat, you will starve.  And your prickles<br/>will die with the rest of your body&quot; (said by Conchis in Fowles&apos; The<br/>Magus)</p><p>2. Generative criticism (a gourmet food fight?):<br/>&#x9;&quot;... the aim of the critic, beyond that of saying what he thinks,<br/>is to make two thoughts grow where only one grew before&quot; (Jacques Barzun<br/>in Science: The Glorious Entertainment)</p><p>By the way, I thought that &quot;sucks&quot; went out of style after it was<br/>appropriated by Ross Perot?</p><p>--Steve</p><p>Stephen Soderberg<br/>Music Division<br/>Library of Congress<br/><a href="mailto:ssod@loc.gov">ssod@loc.gov</a></p><p>On Tue, 9 Feb 1999, Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Gary Morrison &lt;<a href="mailto:mr88cet@texas.net">mr88cet@texas.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On the subject of using colorful words to describe people&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; art, I don&apos;t have a problem with that...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    On that subject, I&apos;d like to recommend a book that, despite its rather<br/>&gt; dry, scholarly-sounding title, is really a screaming riot to read.

Frankly I find<br/>it interesting to hear peoples likes and dislikes, after all it is a<br/>free country and such knowledge in insightful to who they are. No one is<br/>saying that their opinions are objective facts. That Paul Erlich for<br/>instance doesn&apos;t like Terry Riley I find interesting in that he is the<br/>first one I have met that doesn&apos;t. This changes my assumptions about<br/>everyone else. Paul and I agree on practically nothing yet I understand<br/>his view point and the merit of that viewpoint.<br/>I bring up the Tenney mainly because I think it was a fraud. Maybe<br/>someone out there will correct me which I wish they could. Maybe there<br/>were no rehearsals, who knows. That we should not use the work &quot;sucks&quot;<br/>because Ross Perot made it fashionable is illogical in that there<br/>wouldn&apos;t be any words left that l Hitler hadn&apos;t used. On the other hand<br/>, if we have individuals who won&apos;t express their opinions then maybe<br/>they are the same way with their music, and the schools are filled with<br/>this !<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/1999 4:59:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The thesaurus of melodic scales is the only book I have read by the Master<br/>Slonimsky.
