People<br/>are into tunings for different reasons, obviously...I approached this<br/>realm as a musician looking for new ways to create and compose...the<br/>theory, for me, often follows what I hear in my mind, instead of the<br/>other way around. Music is sound, much of the list is theories ABOUT<br/>sound...I want to hear what you guys are talking about...hopefully, that<br/>will happen someday...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=1357 href="#1357">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/1999 5:12:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; it&apos;s real obvious that the list is<br/>&gt; very heavily theoretically oriented lately...it would be wunderbar if<br/>&gt; you lattice/math folks were putting out CD&apos;s of killer music which put<br/>&gt; your monster ideas to work creating beautiful and profound music.</p><p>   As always I agree with Neil on this.  I think though that it&apos;s also<br/>desirable to use the list also for conveying and debating auditory<br/>impressions/emotions/etc. of various intervals, melodic effects, entire<br/>compositions, and such.</p><p>   Clearly there has to be a balance of topic matter though.  Theory gives<br/>performers and composers new concepts to build new music from, so it&apos;s<br/>certainly important.  But theory to the point of it becoming not much more<br/>than theorizing for theory&apos;s sake, should be viewed as a questionable use<br/>of our time.</p><p>   I think that the list tends to have more theoretical traffic than<br/>musical for two main reasons:<br/>1.  It&apos;s still basically a boring ol&apos; text medium, and as such it&apos;s<br/>    it&apos;s much easier to discuss theoretical constructs than audi-<br/>    tory ones.<br/>2.  Tools generating and transmitting auditory and visual infor-<br/>    mation over the net are still in limited supply to most list<br/>    members.  They are also still somewhat crude compared to<br/>    tools for generating words, words, and more words.</p><p>   So what I&apos;m getting at is two-fold.  The fact that we don&apos;t have more<br/>music going on over the list is partly - maybe even largely - due to the<br/>inherent nature of the list, and we need to do whatever we can to acquire<br/>and develop whatever tools we can to make purely musical interchange more<br/>feasible.</p></div><h3><a id=1360 href="#1360">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/1999 12:00:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary Morrison wrote:</p><p>&gt;    But theory to the point of it becoming not much more<br/>&gt; than theorizing for theory&apos;s sake, should be viewed as a questionable use<br/>&gt; of our time.<br/>&gt; Gary I could not agree more. I find some of the posts very informative and I<br/>&gt; must admit some folks&apos; ideas and exploration--In my case, involving Scala<br/>&gt; etc..midi dumps...the tuning list was essential.
