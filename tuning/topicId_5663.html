I&apos;ve seen<br/>one of his neck/fingerboards and it really works great!  Mark Rankin sells<br/>kits where the frets are glued on.  Don&apos;t know what his prices are.</p><p>Graphite epoxy (or carbon fiber if you prefer) was not available when Tom<br/>designed his system.  Using this material, I believe I can make a thin neck<br/>strong enough to withstand the pull of the strings.  I am hoping this will<br/>enable me to use a thin wooden fingerboard instead of Tom&apos;s ultra-thin steel<br/>one.  The magnet in Tom&apos;s design didn&apos;t seem to affect the strings at all,<br/>but a thicker fingerboard puts the magnet farther from the strings which<br/>makes me feel better, if nothing else.  I am working on a neck like this for<br/>David Sethares right now.  I&apos;ll give you more details as my work proceeds.</p><p>One of the many gems of information that Tom gave me is that his patents<br/>have all expired, so I&apos;m not violating anything by re-engineering his<br/>system.
