These areas are better known as the<br/>&quot;mind&apos;s eye&quot; because they are, in essence, our imagination&apos;s canvas. Any<br/>make-believe picture begins there. Thus, Baron suggests that the brain may<br/>create a symbolic image to help it decipher changes in pitch.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;...As expected, dissonance made areas of the limbic system linked to<br/>unpleasant emotions light up in the PET scans, whereas the consonant<br/>melodies stimulated limbic structures associated with pleasure.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;...&quot;The fact that whale and human music have so much in common even<br/>though our evolutionary paths have not intersected for 60 million years,&quot;<br/>they write, &quot;suggests that music may predate humansÂ—that rather than being<br/>the inventors of music, we are latecomers to the musical scene.&quot;&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;...That same bird sings in the chromatic scale, which divides the octave<br/>into 12 semitones, and the hermit thrush sings in the so-called pentatonic<br/>scale.&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;...&quot;Some researchers are finding that listening to familiar music<br/>activates neural structures deep in the ancient primitive regions of the<br/>brain, the cerebellar vermis,&quot; Levitin writes. &quot;For music so profoundly to<br/>affect this gateway to emotion, it must have some ancient and important<br/>function.&quot;&gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt;...he suggests that music stimulates our drive to find patterns in the<br/>environment. &quot;Our brain is constantly trying to make order out of disorder,<br/>and music is a fantastic pattern game for our higher cognitive centers,&quot; he<br/>writes. &quot;From our culture, we learn (even if unconsciously) about musical<br/>structures, tones and other ways of understanding music as it unfolds over<br/>time; and our brains are exercised by extracting different patterns and<br/>groupings from music&apos;s performance.&quot;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Question: Do such conceptual speculations from &quot;people in white-coats&quot; as<br/>found in this article deserve our &quot;admiration&quot;, &quot;refutations&quot;, or simply arouse our suspicions that reductionists will (attempt to, anyway)<br/>eventually drown our &quot;tacit knowledge&quot; with &quot;objectifications&quot; and<br/>&quot;atomization&quot; of our &quot;creations&quot;??? What *would* a whale think about all<br/>this human &quot;hubbub&quot;?</p><p>Curiously,  J Gill    *~&lt;|:)</p></div>
