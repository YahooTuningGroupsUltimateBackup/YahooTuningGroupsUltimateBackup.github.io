Looks promising; I wish I could read it.</p><p>&gt;   () Shall I take it that your targets are ratios here?  In<br/>&gt;   that case I don&apos;t need the cents column either.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh yes you do. All those ratios are tempered.</p><p>I know that, but I&apos;m interested for the time being in the<br/>target intervals you want, not how you&apos;ve tempered them.<br/>Let me ask: how did you arrive at your list of target<br/>intervals?</p><p>(1) Lists of past theoreticians?<br/>(2) Field measurements?<br/>(3) Personal experience?<br/>(4) etc.</p><p>In the case of (2), I could imagine your list would be<br/>a list of cents.  But in your case, I thought you had a<br/>rational interpretation of Maqam music...  Trying to<br/>understand that first, then understand your 79-of-159.</p><p>&gt;   () What are the ratios in parenthesis?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alternative ratios.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>&gt;   () Some of these ratios have large numbers in them.  Are<br/>&gt;   they compound, in the sense that they are reached by<br/>&gt;   stacking certain target intervals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean ratios containing high primes?</p><p>No, just the opposite: large numbers that can be factored.<br/>That is, they are formed by the stacking of two primary<br/>intervals.  Usually (but not always) such intervals appear<br/>in scales because they lie a primary interval away from<br/>a tone which itself is a primary interval away from the tonic.<br/>Example: 15/8 in the classical JI pentatonic scale is not<br/>a consonance (primary ratio), but is a 5:4 above 3/2, which<br/>itself is 3:2 above the tonic.  In listing the primary<br/>intervals of the diatonic scale I would list...</p><p>5:4<br/>3:2<br/>5:3</p><p>...and maybe their inversions, but not 15:8.</p><p>Now I don&apos;t know if Maqam music employs the concept of<br/>primary consonances (does it?) or even primary<br/>intervals (does it?)....</p><p>&gt;   Since you have said that Maqam music has &quot;key&quot;, I seek<br/>&gt;   only the targets needed in a single key, not those<br/>&gt;   needed over the course of an entire piece if it modulates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have provided the ones you need. Those and their<br/>&gt; transpositions a fourth and fifth above.</p><p>Can you list them once more for me, just the ratios or the<br/>cents (whichever are primary), since otherwise I am bound<br/>to get confused.</p><p>As for the transpositions... are these needed only when<br/>the key-center of the Maqam changes, or are they part of<br/>the tonic universe?</p><p>&gt;   Also, if some targets are<br/>&gt;   used in certain Maqams and not in others, it would be<br/>&gt;   helpful to group them by Maqam.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, this is exactly what I aim to do with each Maqam in my<br/>dissertation.</p><p>Aha!  Perhaps then doing the same here, perhaps just for the<br/>1 or 2 most popular Maqams...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2005 5:35:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I doubt you can Gene. har har. 8-)<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 02 Kas&imath;m 2005 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 2:39<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Keys and 79 MOS 159-tET</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; You may want to download my 3rd Doctorate Thesis Report at:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/mainpage/academic.html">http://www.ozanyarman.com/mainpage/academic.html</a><br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Which contains a thorough analysis of 79 MOS 159-tET.</p><p>  I doubt Carl reads Turkish.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2005 5:53:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I doubt you can Gene. har har. 8-)</p><p>Fortunately, Turkish mathematicians don&apos;t write in Turkish.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2005 7:24:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>That&apos;s why you are a mathematician, and I am a musician.
