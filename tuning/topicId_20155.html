I much agree that while the written repertory may<br/>give some clues as to what _might_ be more &quot;probable&quot; in the way of<br/>split keys, each instrument follows its own logic, and that the kind<br/>of improvised transpositions you describe could make A# immediately<br/>useful in a way which studying contemporary accidental usage in known<br/>compositions might not reveal.</p><p>Although my discussion focused on the emphasis of Ramos (1482) and<br/>Schlick (1511) on the Ab/G# question, and on the usefulness of Ab in<br/>transpositions of Dorian, for example, down a major second from D to C<br/>(with a signature of Bb and Eb) where the usual flexible step H/B or<br/>B/Bb (German and English notations) becomes A/Ab, I much agree that if<br/>we transpose E Phrygian up a step to F#, then A# is needed if we<br/>desire a major third above the final (G# in the untransposed verson of<br/>this mode).</p><p>Here, interestingly, both Ramos and Schlick provide evidence that<br/>although they themselves did _not_ consider such a major third above<br/>the final in Phrygian to be essential, other musicians may have<br/>already felt it important, a position evidently becoming the norm by<br/>around the 1520&apos;s or 1530&apos;s.</p><p>Both Ramos and Schlick address the question not of Bb/A# but of Ab/G#,<br/>but as I now realize after reading your article, with some significant<br/>implications if one considers that the transposition of Phrygian up a<br/>whole-tone step may have been not too uncommon in practice.</p><p>In 1482, while much of Ramos&apos;s weighing of the merits on Ab vs. G#<br/>focuses on the use of these notes in cadential major thirds expanding<br/>to fifths or major sixths expanding to octaves, a somewhat ambiguous<br/>passage may address the matter of a major third above the final in the<br/>usual E Phrygian.</p><p>In one reading of this passage which I find attractive and likely, in<br/>part because of his discussion elsewhere of the modes, he notes the<br/>argument that his favored Ab-C# tuning cannot divide the Phrygian<br/>fifth E-B into a major third below and minor third above --<br/>i.e. E-G#-B.</p><p>However, in his view, the third might well be omitted, or the division<br/>used with a major third in regard to the upper note of the fifth and a<br/>minor third in regard to the lower note, i.e. E-G-B.</p><p>Although not without ambiguity -- Mark Lindley has read this passage<br/>to refer to the fifth &quot;from B,&quot; i.e. B-F# -- Ramos&apos;s remarks would fit<br/>the apparent state of practice at the time, a state of affairs still<br/>evidently obtaining when Schlick wrote in 1511.</p><p>While Schlick cleverly finesses the tuning of Ab to provide a<br/>serviceable but rather heavily tempered major third Ab-C and a<br/>possibly near-Pythagorean E-G# satisfactory for use in rapid and<br/>somewhat ornamented cadences, this arrangement would evidently not be<br/>so apt if one desired to have final cadences in Phrygian concluding<br/>with a sonority featuring a major third above the final.</p><p>Thus it follows that in 1511, as in 1482 (if Ramos is referring to the<br/>fifth E-B), a major third above the final of E Phrygian was not<br/>universally considered essential by Western European musicians.</p><p>However, the remarks by Ramos also suggest (again if he refers to the<br/>fifth E-B) that as early as 1482, some musicians _did_ desire this<br/>major third, and furthermore saw this desire as an important advantage<br/>of a 12-note tuning in Eb-G#.</p><p>Changes in cadential and other vertical progressions during the 15th<br/>and early 16th centuries make a fascinating topic, and here I would<br/>like to cover just enough to give the views of Ramos and Schlick some<br/>musical context.</p><p>From the earliest era of regular writing for three and four voices,<br/>the period of Perotin and his colleagues around 1200 or a bit earlier,<br/>we find a kind of cadence on E which becomes standard by the 14th<br/>century:</p><p>D4 E4<br/>A3 B3<br/>F3 E3</p><p>Here the lower third expands to a fifth, and the outer sixth to an<br/>octave, arriving at a complete trine with outer octave, lower fifth,<br/>and upper fourth (a pure 2:3:4 in Pythagorean intonation).</p><p>In a Gothic style, one way to expand this typical three-voice<br/>progression to four voices is to add a resolution from the major tenth<br/>to the twelfth:</p><p>A4  B4<br/>D4  E4<br/>A3  B3<br/>F3  E3</p><p>This majestic progression nicely fits the style of the 14th century,<br/>but raises a problem by the middle 15th century: the parallel fifths<br/>and octaves, more and more consistently avoided both in practice and<br/>in theory under the new stylistic guidelines.</p><p>With only three voices, the traditional Gothic form is still viable<br/>and popular, fitting the remarks of Ramos suggesting that in Phyrgian<br/>one may have a cadence involving the fifth E-B without a third -- in<br/>older medieval terms, finishing on the complete trine E3-B3-E4 or its<br/>prime interval of the lower fifth.</p><p>Such a cadence may also be adorned in the &quot;modern&quot; 15th-century manner<br/>with a suspension, e.g. a major seventh resolving to a major sixth<br/>which then expands in usual fashion to the octave:</p><p>   *<br/>E3    D3 E4<br/>B3 A3    B3<br/>G3 F3    E3</p><p>   M7-M6</p><p>This kind of three-voice solution remarks standard and popular<br/>throughout the 16th century.</p><p>In another type of Phyrgian cadence which avoids the Renaissance<br/>problem of parallel fifths or octaves in four voices, the bass may<br/>ascend by a fifth or descend by a fourth:</p><p>E4 E3<br/>C4 B3<br/>A3 B3<br/>A2 E3</p><p>Here the next-to-highest voice has a characteristic descending<br/>semitone motion giving the cadence its &quot;Phyrgian&quot; quality, while the<br/>two middle voices contract from minor third to unison.</p><p>Around the time of Ramos and Schlick, these cadences arriving at<br/>fifth-octave consonances (the term &quot;trine&quot; maybe implying a Gothic<br/>outlook a bit dated by this point) remained very common, with final<br/>cadences arriving at a sonority including a third just coming into<br/>vogue (e.g. Josquin, Isaac).</p><p>Furthermore, in cadences around 1500 which do conclude on a sonority<br/>including a third, that third might well be minor in relation to the<br/>modal final or the lowest note, for example</p><p>E4  E4<br/>C4  B3<br/>A3  G3<br/>A2  E3</p><p>Later in the 16th-century -- Aaron mentions the practice as early as<br/>1523 -- performers would routinely (although not necessarily<br/>invariably) sing an inflection of G-mi, that is G#, in order to obtain<br/>a closing major third, but in the Josquin/Isaac era that close on a<br/>minor third might well have been favored. Such a state of affairs<br/>would fit the remark of Ramos (in its E-B reading) that one may well<br/>divide the Phyrgian fifth into a sonority with a major third above and<br/>minor third below -- here E3-G3-B3-E4.</p><p>Schlick&apos;s evident view of G# as a note occurring in cadences which can<br/>be marginally accommodated in a 12-note tuning while preferring Ab for<br/>a more sustained major third Ab-C also suggests cadences in E Phrygian<br/>concluding on a sonority without the major third E-G#.</p><p>In fact, at least to me, cadences on a fifth-octave consonance or a<br/>sonority with the minor third E-G seem nicely to fit the style and<br/>musical color of the time.</p><p>However, tastes may have varied, with the preference for a concluding<br/>major third in evidence by the epoch of Aaron&apos;s publications, and with<br/>Vicentino and Zarlino making this preference an element of their<br/>expressive aesthetics.</p><p>Returning to Lucca in 1480, if one applies Zarlino&apos;s later remarks<br/>that transpositions up or down a whole-tone are among the more common<br/>ones, then F# Phrygian would indeed place the Bb/A# question in a<br/>position analogous to that of the Ab/G# question in E Phyrgian. Two<br/>years later, Ramos&apos;s ambiguous but suggestive passage may hint that<br/>some musicians already preferred the option of a major third above the<br/>final -- providing a rationale for Eb-G# as a standard 12-note tuning,<br/>and also for Bb/A# if we regard the transposition up a whole-tone as a<br/>not-too-unlikely one.</p><p>Based on this kind of reasoning, I would much agree with your helpful<br/>caution that simply looking at the known composed repertory of this<br/>period may give a very partial and selective view of which accidentals<br/>organists may have found useful in practice -- quite apart from<br/>general issues of just how comprehensive or representative a record we<br/>have in the manuscripts and (starting with Petrucci around 1501)<br/>printed editions which happen to have come down to us.</p><p>Dialogue at once enriches and informs, and your article is a fine<br/>example of how these discussions can enlarge and more fully educate my<br/>perspectives on such a question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
