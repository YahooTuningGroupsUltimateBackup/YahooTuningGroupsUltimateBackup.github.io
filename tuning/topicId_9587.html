The poster was<br/>&gt; asking about distances between two notes, and a two-note interval is the<br/>&gt; same as its mirror inversion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Formula=The sum of the pitches and the first order difference tone but<br/>&gt; omitting any unison duplication.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This will simply be twice the larger number in the ratio, since a + b + (a -<br/>&gt; b) = 2*a, unless the difference tone coincides with the lower tone, which it<br/>&gt; only does for the ratio 2/1, or with both tones as in 1/1. So, except for<br/>&gt; the unison and octave, Kraig&apos;s measure is the same as the &quot;integer limit&quot; of<br/>&gt; the ratio.</p><p>not quite. If we take my example  of one of the inversions of the 6-7-8-9 and space it D=9<br/>A#=14 G=24 C=32. in this inversion A# occurs as a 14 not a 7. Sorry if this was not clear.<br/>Helmholtz examines triads on Pages 214-225 dover ed. In a way it might undermine the limit<br/>idea. The difference tone of 23 occurs between the lowest and upper tones and plays a part in<br/>this inversion sounding more harsh than simpler versions. For quite a number of years I<br/>composed pieces based exclusively  on the inversions of a chord. It is quite possible to build<br/>up quite a bit of tension and relaxation. One of the (inversion) cataloging methods was an<br/>adaptation of schrodingers Wave equation given to me by a quantum physicist.  The formula is<br/>now sadly lost ( I had to follow a guideline he gave me not necessarily understanding what i<br/>was doing). although it did not produce an even consonance/disonance arrangement, I found the<br/>results reflecting an order that was musically interesting. There seemed to be an underlying<br/>logic to it all. maybe someone out there can reconstruct this one!!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;I&apos;d be happy to discuss all this in greater depth, but there is one<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;important problem with these lattice-based measures.

That is only one<br/>&gt; of myriad examples.</p><p>Yes Terry Riley and Carl Lumma like to use this one. It all depends how long you hold the<br/>sound.
