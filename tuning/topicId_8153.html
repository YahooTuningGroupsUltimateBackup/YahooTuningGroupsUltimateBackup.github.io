These are the runs that Mozart said must &quot;flow like oil&quot;?</p><p>Thanks Paul H. Although tastes may have changed greatly in the last 200<br/>years, the idea of hearing chromatic runs in Mozart played as short phrases<br/>of a few notes at a time makes me cringe. How would you choose the<br/>beginnings and endings of these phrases to make sense both harmonically and<br/>rhythmically? Why didn&apos;t Mozart indicate these phrasings in his score? Based<br/>on my artistic sensibilities, I&apos;d have to agree with Mathieu. On the other<br/>hand, my artistic sensibilities could be nothing more than a product of my<br/>environment . . .</p></div>
