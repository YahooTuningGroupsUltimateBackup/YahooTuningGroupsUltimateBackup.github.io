Guitar just seems to be in such a lull, or down<br/>&gt;time, that I would think anything this &quot;new&quot; and cool would be gobbled<br/>&gt;up...</p><p>This rather surprises me [and OK, so I *forgot* that AC-DC was a<br/>rock(punk?) group..]</p><p>If people aren&apos;t &quot;hooked&quot; on (not literally, I hope) guitars right now,<br/>what are they doing... just rappin&apos; with one note again.  GREAT PARADIGM --<br/>it sure solves the &quot;gravitational problem.&quot;</p><p>Frankly, although I made a living for 12 years as a professional pianist, I<br/>am also now learning classical (until I &quot;plug in&quot;) guitar, just to keep up<br/>with the pack.  Now I find the pack is running the other way.  I hope,<br/>sincerely, they don&apos;t have teeth!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8528 href="#8528">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@capecod.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2000 12:15:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Joseph Pehrson:]<br/>&gt; If people aren&apos;t &quot;hooked&quot; on (not literally, I hope) guitars right<br/>now, what are they doing...</p><p>Oh, it&apos;s still there of course... my meaning was more that it&apos;s<br/>*usage* was in a rut, a lull, a down time...
