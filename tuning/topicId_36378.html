I&apos;ve got a website about this:<br/><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nguyenhu">http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nguyenhu</a></p><p>Our purpose is to make the melody become not the creation of an<br/>individual but that of a community of songwriters. Collaboration and<br/>participation are much appreciated. It&apos;s a chance for you to get to<br/>know more about the music of other cultures, countries.</p><p>You can download the melody over there. If you want to follow it,<br/>send your composition to us, then we will append it to the melody.<br/>Our concept is clearly shown in our website. Pls come and join.<br/><a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nguyenhu">http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nguyenhu</a></p><p>Thanks.<br/>Chung.</p></div>
