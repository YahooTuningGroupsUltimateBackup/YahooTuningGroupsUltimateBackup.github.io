Actually, Greek mathematicians give about 8 more-- see Heath,<br/>&quot;A History of Greek Mathematics&quot; for details. I used all of them and a<br/>couple I invented myself to generate tetrachords in &quot;Divisions.&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t recall seeing much use of the geometric mean in Greek music<br/>theory. The only JI contexts where it might occur are in sequences such<br/>as 1/1 4/3 16/9 and 1/1 3/2 9/4, though the fact that the geometric mean<br/>lies between the harmonic and the arithmetic was known. One might<br/>interpret most of Aristoxenos&apos;s genera as being based conceptually on<br/>the geometric mean to aurally divide the pyknotic interval into two<br/>parts.</p><p>I&apos;ve never been able to get a completely clear idea from Jim French what<br/>the scales of his auloi are. He is a believer in Schlesinger, or was the<br/>last time we discussed the subject at one of Mark Miner&apos;s Homer<br/>recitations some years ago at UCSD, but he also states that the reed has<br/>an enormous effect on the tuning. Lou Harrison told me that the Korean<br/>equivalent, the piri, is very hard to play in tune and that once he<br/>inadvertently played a passage a fifth too high without realizing it.<br/>However, he never said anything about the harmoniai, with which he was<br/>acquainted. I can easily believe that KS played what she wanted to hear<br/>or heard what she wanted to hear on her home-built replicas.</p><p>However, other than making it possible, I don&apos;t see how these<br/>experiments settle whether the Greeks actually used the Harmoniai as she<br/>interprets them. Barring new archeological discoveries, I don&apos;t see how<br/>the question can be answered on the basis of the data we have.</p><p>I can make little sense out of her notational claims, especially since<br/>the scales she derives from the notation are different from those she<br/>considers canonical. Also, the idea that the primary mode, the Dorian,<br/>was retuned to sub-21 from 22 seems hard to accept in the absence of any<br/>literary references. Likewise, lowering the Lydian M.D. 26 to 27 is<br/>doubtful, though one can make up a nice sub-27 scale.</p><p>Her theory breaks down completely in the chromatic and enharmonic<br/>genera- I devoted a large part of a chapter in &quot;Divisions&quot; to the kind<br/>of scales one gets when her theories are applied to these forms of the<br/>harmoniai. Suffice it to say, that although all the diatonic forms are<br/>modes of the Dorian and each other, the chromatic and enharmonic forms<br/>of the harmoniai are not.</p><p>As I said, though, the system is fascinating in its own right as a set<br/>of xenharmonic scales and quite extensible. If we can get good<br/>monophonic recordings of the harmoniai on played on replica instruments<br/>or better, performances by master musicians on their own instruments in<br/>their own styles, I think Can Akkoc&apos;s software would answer the<br/>questions of whether they are easily and naturally playable on auloi (or<br/>flutes) and whether they are in fact played in extant non-European<br/>music.</p><p>The question of the roots of Greek civilization and its relation to<br/>Africa and Western Asia is complex. Historians are virtually unanimous<br/>in rejecting extreme views such as those in &quot;Stolen Legacy,&quot; but some<br/>feel that many of the points raised in &quot;Black Athena&quot; are valid, though<br/>the African origin of Athena and the other Greek gods is not generally<br/>accepted. The relation of Greek culture to Babylonian and Western<br/>Semitic has also been underappreciated.</p><p>Greek mathematics is closer to Babylonian than to Egyptian. Since<br/>nothing is known about Egyptian music, little can be said about the<br/>influence.The claim that the Egyptians used the semitonal pentatonic<br/>cannot be verified by any historical reference, though it is not<br/>unlikely since this scale is very common in South India, Japan, and<br/>Ethiopia.</p><p>BTW, the common Ethiopian lyre is called a Krar in Amharic and a Kissar<br/>(s = sh?) in other language(s). These terms are probably derived from<br/>kithara, but I don&apos;t know if Kora is related or not. Ethiopian music<br/>also uses the whole-tone pentatonic and in Muslim areas, the usual kind<br/>of 1/4-tone inflected Arabo-Persian diatonic scales are found.</p><p>While the Ethiopian alphabet (a syllabary of some 280 or so characters)<br/>is derived apparently from South Arabia, the numerals are derived from<br/>Greek letters (the arithmetic notation is decimal).Ethiopia also uses<br/>the only logical calendar-- 12 months of 30 days plus a 5 or 6 day<br/>holiday at the end to make up the 365 or 366 day solar year. Apparently<br/>it derives from the old Egyptian calendar. Ethiopian Airlines advertises<br/>&quot;13 Months of Sunshine&quot; to tourists.</p><p>--John</p></div>
