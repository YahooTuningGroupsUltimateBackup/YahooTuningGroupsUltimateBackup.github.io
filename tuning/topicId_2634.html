[*]</p><p> This doesn&apos;t change your argument, because your point is that<br/> 15:8 should have greater complexity than 6:5, neither lower *nor*<br/> equal.  I can agree with that.</p><p> [Erlich]<br/> &gt; You were saying that your lattice makes composites appear<br/> &gt; simpler than their odd or prime represenatations would suggest.<br/> &gt; That doesn&apos;t seem to be true.</p><p> Hold on - don&apos;t get it twisted.<br/> This is what I originally said:</p><p> [me, monz, TD 155.10]<br/> &gt; In my lattice formula the prime-factoring<br/> &gt; itself makes composite factors such as 9 and 15 shorter<br/> &gt; distances than their odd/integer values would indicate,<br/> &gt; and to me this is the whole point of using prime instead<br/> &gt; of odd factoring.</p><p> My lattices *are* a prime representation, so there&apos;s no way<br/> that composites could appear simpler than their prime<br/> representations, unless mine have strange wormholes too.</p><p> They do, however, make composites appear simpler than their<br/> *odd* limits, which I think represents acoustical/musical<br/> reality better than an odd-limit.  That was the whole reason,<br/> about 10 years ago, that I decided prime-factoring was<br/> useful and/or important in music.</p><p> (It turned out to be true later, when I &apos;invented&apos; my lattices,<br/> that it was even more useful for representing large harmonic<br/> systems with maximal simplicity, IMO.)</p><p> Here&apos;s what I was getting at:</p><p> [Erlich, TD 156.14]<br/> &gt; 1st axis: steps of 3:2 have length log(3)<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; 2nd axis: steps of 5:4 have length log(5)<br/> &gt; the angle between the first and second axes is determined by the<br/> &gt; condition that steps of 5:3 have length log(5)<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; 3rd axis: steps of 7:4 have length log(7)<br/> &gt; the angle between the the first and third axes is determined by<br/> &gt; the condition that steps of 7:5 have length log (7)<br/> &gt; the angle between the second and third axes is determined by the<br/> &gt; condition that steps of 7:6 have length log (7)</p><p> This isn&apos;t logical to me.  You&apos;re using the *limit* prime<br/> of each ratio to determine the vector, whereas my lattice<br/> formula *adds the complexity for each prime* found as a factor.</p><p> So in your formula, it doesn&apos;t matter whether 7 is combined<br/> with 2, 3, or 5 - they all have a metric based on 7.</p><p> In my formula, 7:4, 7:6, and 7:5 are all different, each metric<br/> longer than the one before it, based on all their prime factors<br/> (numbers inside the table are the exponents of the prime factors<br/> on the top line):</p><p>               2  3  5  7<br/>      7:4 = | -2  0  0  1|<br/>      7:6 = | -1 -1  0  1|<br/>      7:5 = |  0  0 -1  1|</p><p> This reflects well my feeling that 7:4 is less complex than both<br/> 7:6 and 7:5, that 7:6 is more complex than 7:4 but less complex<br/> than 7:5, and 7:5 more complex than both 7:4 and 7:6.  (Of course,<br/> in this simple example an integer-limit would do the same.)</p><p> So on your lattice:</p><p> [Erlich]<br/> &gt; the distance corresponding to 9:5 is log(5)+log(3)=log(15).<br/> &gt; However, 9:5 is more consonant than 11:5, which unfortunately<br/> &gt; has a shorter length of log(11).</p><p> This is not the case on my lattice.</p><p> On a prime lattice (like mine) the 9:5 ratio is 3 rungs away<br/> from 1:1 :  2 positive rungs along the 3-axis, and 1 negative<br/> rung along the 5-axis.</p><p> The way my formula works, the 3^2 vector (with<br/> a length of 2 * 3) gives the same length (= complexity)<br/> that a &apos;6&apos; would have on an integer-limit lattice, or half-way<br/> between 5 and 7 on an odd-limit lattice, which uses this type of<br/> straight-value length measurement (as opposed to using logs).<br/> Then the 5^-1 vector adds more complexity to it, which I think<br/> is appropriate, as 9:5 *is* more complex than 9:4, or 9:8.</p><p> The metric (i.e., direct connection) length for 9:5 is<br/> ~8.12, longer than that for 7:4 [= 7.0], which<br/> agrees with my, and I think most people&apos;s, perceptions.<br/> And the metric for 11:5 is 8.6, a bit longer than 9:5&apos;s,<br/> which is what you expressed a desire to acheive.</p><p> The problem I have with this formula is that 16:9 has<br/> a vector length of only 6.0, which is *less* than that<br/> for 7:4, which doesn&apos;t agree with my, or most people&apos;s,<br/> perceptions.</p><p> With my metric, the complementary ratios always have exactly<br/> the same value.</p><p> Here are some frequently used ratios (and some others I&apos;ve<br/> been interested in lately), ranked in order by my lattice metric<br/> (rounded to the nearest 1/10th):</p><p>      1/1               0.0<br/>      2/1               2.0<br/>      3/2      4/3      3.0<br/>      5/4      8/5      5.0<br/>     16/15    15/8      5.6<br/>      9/8     16/9      6.0<br/>      6/5      5/3      6.0<br/>      7/4      8/7      7.0<br/>      7/6     12/7      7.1<br/>     45/32    64/45     7.5<br/>     11/9     18/11     8.0<br/>     10/9      9/5      8.1<br/>     14/9      9/7      8.4<br/>     11/10    20/11     8.6<br/>     27/16    32/27     9.0<br/>     11/6     12/11     9.1<br/>     13/9     18/13     9.4<br/>     25/16    32/25    10.0<br/>     40/27    27/20    10.6<br/>     13/12    24/13    10.9<br/>     11/8     16/11    11.0<br/>    225/224  448/225   11.2<br/>      7/5     10/7     12.0<br/>     81/64   160/81    12.0<br/>     13/8     16/13    13.0<br/>     99/80   160/99    14.4</p><p> There are some problems with this.  For example, 5:3 should<br/> certainly have a shorter metric than 15:8, altho the difference<br/> is really not that great.  16:9 should be longer than 7:4,<br/> with that difference of 1 unit possibly being significant, and<br/> it most definitely should have a longer metric than 5:3,<br/> which it equals here.</p><p> 40:27, as I remarked recently, sounds far more complex, and<br/> dissonant, than any of the ratios listed after it here:  24:13 is<br/> another neutral &apos;major 7th&apos; that I like a lot, 11:8 and 13:8<br/> are both commonly used by many JI composers in stable chords<br/> in a way that 40:27 would never be appropriate.  So there&apos;s<br/> certainly room for improvement in this formula.</p><p> But overall, I feel that it does a pretty decent job of<br/> representing the complexity and/or sonance of intervals<br/> from the perspective of viewing the entire harmonic complex,<br/> that is, not just observing them as individual dyads, but<br/> placing them in relation to each other with a view towards<br/> accomodating their varied harmonic uses, and therefore,<br/> the different lattice metrics that result from different<br/> combinations of the same ratios.</p><p> Let&apos;s look at those 7-limit ratios again, shall we?,<br/> and reproduce that table with my metric values added:</p><p>               2  3  5  7   Monzo lattice metric<br/>      7:4 = | -2  0  0  1|     7.0<br/>      7:6 = | -1 -1  0  1|     7.1<br/>      7:5 = |  0  0 -1  1|    12.0</p><p> The metric for 7:5 may be a little high (but maybe not),<br/> but I think this is basically a really good representation<br/> of the relative complexities of these three ratios, not<br/> considering any particular musical context.</p><p> And all these calculations were done on an &apos;octave&apos;-equivalent<br/> lattice.  I believe that to accurately compare them to your<br/> values I need to make them &apos;octave&apos;-specific, correct?<br/> I&apos;ll make a new table reflecting that in a future posting.</p><p> Feedback appreciated - especially from others besides Paul.<br/> I already know I can count on his opinion  &lt;  {;^)  &gt;<br/> but I&apos;d like some others as well.</p><p> [*]<br/> As can be seen from the table, which I calculated many<br/> hours after writing this sentence, Paul Erlich is correct<br/> that my metric does indeed give a shorter distance for 15:8<br/> than for 6:5, as he stated.  I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d call 5.6<br/> a &apos;considerably lower complexity than 6:5&apos; in relation to<br/> the latter&apos;s value of 6.0, but as I said, even if they were<br/> equal, his point is still valid.</p><p> Many thanks to Paul for the correspondence-crash-course in<br/> trigonometry that he gave me via email yesterday.  Now<br/> hopefully I can follow this complexity thread; at least,<br/> I can now see how my own work fits into the discussion.</p><p> -monz</p><p> Joseph L.
