The combined +/- 4, +/- 2 cents established the noted<br/>&gt; deviations from 12 tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you say that your Piagui scales are &quot;not very close&quot; to 12-tet, and I<br/>&gt; say that they &quot;are very close&quot; to 12-tet, we are simply using different<br/>&gt; standards of what &quot;closeness&quot; is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am using the standard in this case of what the human ear will be able to<br/>&gt; distinguish, and it will be able to distinguish only minimal differences<br/>&gt; between 12-tet and your scale. I am also seeing how it compares to other<br/>&gt; temperaments, and in this respect it is a -LOT- closer to 12-tet than many<br/>&gt; commonly used ones. So in both of regards, a temperament that is within 4<br/>&gt; cents at all times of 12-tet will be a LOT &quot;closer&quot; to 12-tet than a<br/>&gt; temperament that has a major third that is 10 cents closer to 5/4 than<br/>&gt; 12-tet&apos;s is, or that represents 7/4 to within 3 cents. 41-equal, 53-equal,<br/>&gt; miracle temperament, etc can do all of these things, your temperament<br/>&gt; cannot. Your temperament can in general handle all of the intervals that<br/>&gt; 12-tet can.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those are my standards for judging how &quot;valid&quot; a temperament is or how<br/>&gt; &quot;close&quot; to 12-tet it is.

I explained some of its features which are related with scales, how the pithagorean comma takes part of it as well as semitones 256/ 243, 135/128, 16/15, Piagui K and P; perfect links of 3/2 and 4/3 between any chosen cell and a second one, comparisons between Piagui and 12TET chord wave peak responses and other remarkable relations.</p><p>The progression was derived in 1983 and come from 612 products of M, J, U commas. When each comma is multiplied by a cell frequency, the following cell frequency is obtained. It is a cyclical process that starts with 1 = C.</p><p>Cell N&ordm; 1 = M* 1 = M.<br/>Cell N&ordm; 2 = M* Cell N&ordm; 1 = M^2<br/>Cell N&ordm; 3 = J* Cell N&ordm; 2 = J*M^2<br/>Cell N&ordm; 4 = J* Cell N&ordm; 3 = (J^2)*M^2 --- U comma factor works for the first time as a factor of cell N&ordm; 23 to get N&ordm; 24.<br/>...................etc<br/>The first 52 cells are the results of the following comma factor sequence:<br/>MMJJMM MMJJMM MMJJMM   JJMMUU MMJJMM MMJJ   MMJJMM  MMJJMM MMJJMM. Last cell of this group (M^32) (J^18) (U^2), equals semitone factor<br/>K = (9/8)^(1/2).</p><p>Due to printing errors it should be noticed that SETS R&ordm; given in the book must follow the same comma sequence detailed in SETS R.</p><p>The above comma factor sequence is repeated (624/52) = 12 times.

Put 7-tone scales generated by mean-tone, JI, and 12TET...and the average listener often won&apos;t notice a difference.  This, IMVHO, presents a problem as people often end up using unique mathematical method to explain something already there.  History has its wisdom, yes...but by simply repeating it and not adding anything understandable to the public as sounding original, we end up simply repeating history.</p><p>Michael/myself&gt;&gt;&quot;Does it establish a new method IE get JI-like consonance without using JI or<br/>generally high dissonance without beating much?...so the method can be further<br/>explored and more psychoacoustic phenomena discovered.&quot; -myself<br/>before&lt;&quot;</p><p>    In other words, does it at least (if the scale doesn&apos;t sound different from 12TET to the average listener)<br/>A) Use unique mathematical methods to arrive at the similar-sounding to 12TET answer<br/>B) Have the ability to twist around the parameters in the scale generation formula to create new types of scales that sound consonant and yet not at all like 12TET (easy example = Lucy Tuning).</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Mario Pizarro &lt;piagui@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Fri, January 22, 2010 12:15:42 AM<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Regarding Mike&apos;s message</p><p>Michael has a particular way to critize<br/>the work I did since 1983.

Most of the list have enough knowledges with which<br/>they could expand the progression features but seems they are too<br/>busy with other topics.
