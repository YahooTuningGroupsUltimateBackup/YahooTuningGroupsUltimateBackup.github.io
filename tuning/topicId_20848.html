For example, some<br/>&gt; (like Pierre Lamothe) feel that pitch heights<br/>&gt; should correspond to simple ratios; others<br/>&gt; (like myself) subscribe instead to the view<br/>&gt; that intervals should correspond as closely as<br/>&gt; possible to simple ratios; others (like Stephen<br/>&gt; Soderberg) don&apos;t care about ratios at all and<br/>&gt; are interested instead in the &quot;set theory&quot; math<br/>&gt; of pitch classes (this is not related to the &quot;set<br/>&gt; theory&quot; you&apos;d find offered in a mathematics<br/>&gt; department; it relates instead to the numerics<br/>&gt; of musicians like Forte and Babbitt). We&apos;ll<br/>&gt; probably debate these things endlessly (if<br/>&gt; given the opportunity) -- you should come to<br/>&gt; your own conclusions based on some serious<br/>&gt; and honest listening on your own (and of<br/>&gt; course a means of producing microtonal<br/>&gt; musical examples).</p><p>Thanks for the mention, Paul.  Though maybe a little more explanation is<br/>needed here, lest others leave with the impression that I could care less<br/>about how things are tuned.  My recollection is that, yes, I have said (on<br/>more than one occasion) that &quot;how you tune it&quot; is &quot;irrelevant.&quot;  Paul took<br/>strong exception to that stance when I said it in passing on the tuning<br/>list, and I should have made more effort at that time to explain the<br/>context.  So let me try to make up for that now -- Paul and I are not as<br/>far apart here as he might believe (the confusion is my fault).</p><p>First, I have to admit to going for a little shock value in order to get<br/>others to think *beyond* tunings into the region of what compositional<br/>strategies might be implied (or maybe even compelled) by a tuning choice.<br/>To get to that point, one should first realize that, *however* you define<br/>a scale (whether a specific scale you want to use as a compositional basis<br/>or the general notion of &quot;scale&quot;) it&apos;s first and foremost a collection of<br/>pitches (a set) *together with* an &quot;index set&quot; (some way of putting the<br/>collection in &quot;order&quot;).</p><p>If you have some 7-note scale C-D-E-F-G-A-B you can tune these 7 &quot;objects&quot;<br/>with respect to one another in a variety of ways (acoustically relating n<br/>objects -- the broadest definition of tuning (and composition) I can come<br/>up with -- is a lot of what the list is about); and ratios are almost<br/>always involved.  But without indexing those 7 notes -- (pre)assigning<br/>order, importance, etc. -- you have no way of finding your way around or<br/>locating significant structures once you&apos;re into the music (again, a<br/>random walk isn&apos;t necessarily bad, just limiting).  IMO, composition has<br/>as much or more to do with playing with the index set as it does with the<br/>tuning of the underlying objects (tones, notes, pitches)... but with some<br/>very important qualifications.</p><p>Let&apos;s say I want to write a piece based on &quot;quartertones.&quot;  (There are<br/>good logical and aesthetic reasons to pick qts beyond the fact that<br/>they&apos;ve been somewhat maligned around here in the past.)  So I start out<br/>thinking in 24tet.  Because of the fact that 12tet is imbedded in 24tet,<br/>and because I see some very interesting sonorities to be had by tuning<br/>pairs of instruments a qt apart (to say nothing of making it easier on the<br/>traditional classical performer), the &quot;look&quot; of the score has patches of<br/>12tet juxtaposing and interleaving with patches of 12tet a qt higher or<br/>lower.  Now, using my computer&apos;s sound card to get a VERY rough idea of<br/>what all this sounds like, I soon realize that 24 EQUAL is producing a lot<br/>of &quot;off&quot; intervals to my ears.  So I start to play with the MIDI&apos;s equal<br/>setting by shading the quartertones down more and more, i.e., each time<br/>the interface reads, say, &quot;play this B a qt flat,&quot; the qt gets flatter.<br/>What I eventually settle on is not 24 EQUAL at all, but two 12tet scales,<br/>S1 and S2, tuned somewhere between a 1/5-tone and a 1/6-tone apart.</p><p>So now, via my notation software, I have two complete compositions, C1 and<br/>C2, side by side.  In C1, S1 and S2 are as close to an &quot;equal&quot; qt apart as<br/>possible, whereas in C2, S1 and S2 are, say 1/5.29 of a &quot;whole<br/>tone&quot; apart.</p><p>The question then arises, are C1 and C2 the SAME composition or are they<br/>different compositions?  I would answer (my point to all this) BOTH.  In<br/>abstract set-theoretic terms, where it doesn&apos;t matter what the elements of<br/>a set actually are, both C1 and C2 &quot;hang together&quot; compositionally the<br/>exact same way.  Is there a climax at a formal &quot;golden mean&quot;? - if so it&apos;s<br/>still there.  Are some verticles connected by common tones? - if so, they<br/>still are.  And the rhythmic elements, voicing, and tessituras are<br/>identical between C1 and C2; and so on.  [All of these things can<br/>profitably be talked about formally, to one degree or another, as sets --<br/>I&apos;m NOT saying that&apos;s how they are actually composed or heard in the<br/>rough-and-tumble of creation or listening!] But in terms of the<br/>moment-to-moment aural perceptions created, C1 and C2 have radically<br/>different sounds.  Speaking loosely, the &quot;math&quot; by which a lot of the<br/>formal elements are sustained is the same -- the index set relationships<br/>are identical, but the resulting &quot;music,&quot; insofar as it can be separated<br/>from the &quot;math,&quot; is certainly different.</p><p>Another interesting question: does the combination S1 + S2 that permeates<br/>both C1 and C2 result in an equal/unequal 24-tone chromatic basis, or does<br/>it just sound like an &quot;out of focus&quot; 12-tone chromatic?  It could go<br/>either way I think, depending on your skill and intentions in working with<br/>the material.  The result could be intriguing and new, but if you don&apos;t<br/>understand what a mod-24 system offers (there&apos;s a subtle distinction we<br/>should be making between mod-n systems and n-tet tunings), even at some<br/>intuitive level, the result might just be horribly embarrassing.</p><p>[This is all roughly the same as the age-old question about<br/>&quot;versions&quot; -- just more radical.  Bach writes a concerto for oboe and<br/>violin in c minor.  Later he &quot;arranges&quot; it for two violins and puts it in<br/>d minor.  Everything is nearly identical with the exception of giving the<br/>oboe part to a fiddle and transposing the score up a major 2nd.  Same<br/>piece or different?  Again, for many of the same reasons, both (I like the<br/>oboe in there myself).]</p><p>Also note you could further play with the tuning for both C1<br/>and C2:  S1 and S2 don&apos;t HAVE to both be 12tets, and there&apos;s no reason one<br/>couldn&apos;t treat a &quot;megachromatic&quot; basis as the sum of more than two<br/>subchromatics S1+S2+S3+....  There&apos;s something to this, especially in<br/>even-numbered universes.  It&apos;s well-known that any sonority in 12tet, for<br/>example, can be described and heard as a collection of notes selected from<br/>two 6tet (whole tone) scales a half-step apart.  Also, check out the<br/>&quot;Sieves&quot; chapters in Xenakis&apos; _Formalized Music_ where he constructs<br/>scales using only elementary Boolean operations by only positing an<br/>abstract &quot;semitone&quot; (no ratios here at all).</p><p>Bottom line: tuning is important, but it&apos;s only one of many aspects<br/>holding a good piece of music together (I doubt anyone would argue with<br/>this anyway -- and I hope Paul, whose work I greatly respect and admire,<br/>now realizes I sign on to this truism as well).  Finally, in only a tiny,<br/>well-intentioned dig: once you tune, what you have is a set.  Forte and<br/>Babbitt don&apos;t really have much to do with it except for their initial<br/>realizations and groundwork showing how far this idea can be pushed and<br/>how widely it can be applied.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Steve</p><p>Stephen Soderberg<br/>Music Division<br/>Library of Congress</p></div><h3><a id=20853 href="#20853">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I generally dislike the kind of answer that simply<br/>gives a cite for a journal article or book and then tells the questioner<br/>to go read it.  But I don&apos;t think I have a choice here -- any attempt I<br/>would make to give my personal views re your question would be lengthy and<br/>likely degenerate into &quot;Is too! -- Is not!&quot; sidebars.  There is a *huge*<br/>amount of literature out there, hardly any of it getting much play on the<br/>tuning list, that, given minimal math chops and a burning interest, you<br/>can check out.  My suggestion would be to get a copy of Music Theory<br/>Spectrum (21:1, spring 1999) and work through the article &quot;Scales, Sets,<br/>and Interval Cycles: A Taxonomy&quot; by John Clough, Nora Engebretson, and<br/>Jonathan Kochavi.  Then check out their bibliography for further readings.</p><p>Paul Erlich:<br/>&gt; Another reason I don&apos;t like maximal evenness -- why should you have to<br/>&gt; postulate a chromatic set in a musical style which doesn&apos;t make use of one?</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know where you heard that.

But where does the<br/>&gt; fifth itself come from? Tuning theory or set theory?</p><p>I don&apos;t know what glue I was sniffing when I wrote that, but maybe you<br/>were sniffing the same stuff when you answered;-)...  Obviously, when<br/>stacking fifths, near closure comes at 12 for the chromatic.  Stopping the<br/>stack at 7 gives you the tritone, which many (e.g., see Richmond Browne,<br/>&quot;Tonal Implications of the Diatonic Set,&quot; _In Theory Only_ 5/6-7,<br/>pp.3-21) posit as the most important means of orientation within the usual<br/>diatonic since it is the rarest interval there.</p><p>Me &amp; Paul Erlich:</p><p>&gt; &gt;Then there&apos;s maximal evenness, in whatever form<br/>&gt; &gt;you wish to express it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That I won&apos;t buy -- it fails to explain why 7 out of 12 and not, say, 9 out<br/>&gt; of 16. And 7 out of 31 is not maximally even -- oops! (uh-oh, I&apos;m getting<br/>&gt; McLarenish today)</p><p>What part of maximal evenness annoys you the most? -- It&apos;s certainly not a<br/>rival theory whose acceptance implies that all your own excellent work<br/>goes down the tubes!  All it is is an important structural property<br/>possessed by certain scales.  I really don&apos;t get it.</p><p>At any rate, it has been proven by Clough &amp; Douthett (work on ME goes<br/>back at least to Clough &amp; Myerson in 1985) that there is a<br/>unique maximally even set for *any* given choice of cardinalities<br/>d&lt;c.  For the three pairs you give above:</p><p>7 out of 12:     2212221<br/>9 out of 16:     222122221</p><p>which are the usual diatonic and a &quot;hyperdiatonic,&quot; respectively (both<br/>maximally even), and</p><p>7 out of 31:     5454544</p><p>which may not be hyperdiatonic by C&amp;D&apos;s definition (for any one of at<br/>least 10 (mathematically equivalent) reasons), but it IS maximally even.</p><p>As for Xenakis&apos; sieve theory, this is one of those things that threatens<br/>to turn into &quot;Is too!--Is not!&quot;  Obviously Paul and I don&apos;t share the<br/>same criteria for relative importance within a given context.

I<br/>realize that the collection is maximally even, but the arrangement isn&apos;t.<br/>ME is still an interesting property, but there has to be more to it.  The<br/>way the elements are ordered in space and time is the most important I<br/>think.  Also, I think the tritone is the most important interval in 12tet,<br/>the symmetrical division of the octave is probably the most important<br/>interval in any even cardinal ET.

At<br/>&gt; least one way is by (intuitively) mapping it as homologous to the usual<br/>&gt; diatonic and squinting.<br/>&gt;</p><p>    The derivation of the harmonic minor and other &apos;diatonic&apos; scales has<br/>always intrigued me.  I think the tritone plays a role here also, halfsteps<br/>may also play a role, the ever great leading-tone.  The aeolian mode has an<br/>&apos;out of place tritone&apos; that leads nowhere.  In A natural minor, the B leads<br/>to C, with no emphasis, possibly because the entire tritone has yet to be<br/>revealed in the scale.  When the F is reached it proceeds to the G, which<br/>has no pull, there is no leading-tone, no halfstep.  By raising the G to a<br/>G#, we have a new tritone, in a stronger position in the scale.  The<br/>tritone, in my opinion has to be the greatest interval in musical history,<br/>by far the most important.  The pull of a V-I cadence has never been the<br/>same since the inception of the V7-I.</p><p>    I like the ME property and am fascinated ny it, but I also think there<br/>may be something to a disruption of the balance, throwing things off kilter<br/>a little bit.  You can measure a sets relationship to the ME property, I<br/>assume.  For instance, the melodic minor, and harmonic minor, are slightly<br/>les ME, and the 7 tone chromatic is completely off balanced in a 12-tone<br/>world.  I bet, that all the sets in between slowly creep towards and away<br/>from the ME property.  There is a great article by Jay Rahn, that is related<br/>to this idea entitled, &quot;Coordination of Interval Sizes in Seven-Tone<br/>Collections&quot; Journal of Music Theory 35/1-2 (1991).  I can summarize it in a<br/>second post if anyone would like.  It follows some of Clough, Douthett, and<br/>Myerson&apos;s work, but is much simpler, and Rahn takes a non-mathematical<br/>approach.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div><h3><a id=20911 href="#20911">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I believe that any diatonic structure, resulting in<br/>&apos;beautiful&apos; music is not that far off from a maxiamlly even set.  A non ET<br/>set may not be ME, but it is probably very close.  ME doesn&apos;t have anything<br/>to do with accoustics, but the structure of a set, and it&apos;s subsets.  Every<br/>major scale in Werckmeister III is different, not ME, but closely related,<br/>these invariants may provide some charm.  This is like the comment I made<br/>concerning the minor scale in a previous response to Stephen.  I sometimes<br/>envision the ME set as perfect, but I also consider perfection boring.  No<br/>theory can teach one to compose, and no theory can make something sound<br/>good.  All that theory can really do is hint at an ideal, and that is what<br/>Maximal Evenness does, it hints at an ideally structured set.  No, a<br/>maximally even set is not in &apos;tune&apos; (according to few), but does changing<br/>some cents here and there ruin the concept of a maximally even set.<br/>Mathematically yes, but practically no.  I think that humans have innately<br/>understood this principle, and it is interesting that mathematics has shown<br/>that these naturally developed scales are superior in structure.</p><p>    I do not think, though, that ME sets are all that superior (since<br/>superior would require a definition).  Also, compositionally symmetry is<br/>frankly boring.  ME means nothing to composition.  We do not use ME sets as<br/>maximally even, we do not distribute weight among the pitches even, we given<br/>certain pitches prominence.  This does not change the fact that the set has<br/>this property though.  It is only a property not a miracle.</p><p>    I don&apos;t know why ME has been the onl&apos;y property that has been talked<br/>about here.  Set-theory provides so much more wealthy information about sets<br/>than simply whether or not it is maxiamally even (simple set-theory at<br/>that).  I think the concept of ME is complex and not as strong as say,<br/>comparing the interval vectors of many sets, or say, looking at the subset<br/>structures of different sets.  There is much information that is much more<br/>compelling.</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div><h3><a id=20915 href="#20915">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The diatonic Interval Vector shows us that there<br/>is a hierarchy among its transpositions.  You can transpose the scale by a<br/>perfect fifth everytime and retain all tones but one.

I have a &apos;theoretical&apos;<br/>proposal get your opinion on.  You can generalize the creation of harmonic<br/>structure from a scale by following the guides of the diatonic scales.  You<br/>can arrange a &apos;scale&apos; and say that its &apos;tonic&apos; is the first, third and fifth<br/>scale degree.  I think you see where this is going.  Well, last semester I<br/>wrote a few short &apos;virginal style&apos; harpsichord pieces.  The harmonic<br/>structures were based on a tone row, taking the first seven pitches as &apos;C<br/>Major&apos; and the next seven as &apos;G Major&apos; (since based on a row the scales are<br/>not identically in intervallic structure).  The scales that were formed are<br/>conjunct not linear. e.g. C F# A D Bb Eb F C.  The tonic would then be, C A<br/>Bb, the dominant Bb, F, F#.  The results of this were actually very cool.<br/>Stylistically modeled after Fitzwilliam pieces the music had a quasi-tonal<br/>feel, the melodic aspect was difficult but made to work.  I used common<br/>scalar figures, 5 to 1 descents, turning the linear into conjunct.  I guess<br/>what I learned from this was that tonality is strongly related to<br/>&apos;information theory&apos;, pattern recognition, and familiarity.  I do not know<br/>if this technique will be seen in my works again, but it sure was fun.</p><p>I would like to here some comments on this procedure if possible, I think I<br/>may try this is a few simple microtonal works.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div><h3><a id=21005 href="#21005">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/12/2001 8:13:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Steven Kallstrom&quot; &lt;skallstr@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20848.html#20861">/tuning/topicId_20848.html#20861</a></p><p>&gt;     I would like to propose that we select a few tunings, and<br/>examine their structure over the list.

The reason I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; consider all of this as empty sarcasm on my part is this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If, following Clough et al, I say, &quot;DP implies G, and I can prove it,&quot; and<br/>&gt; you reply, &quot;So what if you can? I don&apos;t *like* DP&quot; or &quot;I don&apos;t consider DP<br/>&gt; all that important&quot; -- one thing we&apos;re NOT having is a scholarly dispute.<br/>&gt; Why?  (Evidently this has to be spelled out!)  Because you&apos;re response is<br/>&gt; a communication STOPPER.  You have neither convinced nor defeated my<br/>&gt; premise (we never even got to &quot;DP implies G&quot;) -- you&apos;ve simply made me<br/>&gt; speechless (and more than a little pissed).
