Cold turkey. But I want to tidy<br/>up a few loose ends first. I&apos;ll lurk for a couple more days but will try to<br/>resist posting.</p><p>Monz, brilliant work setting up all those I-IV-V7-I tunings. Sorry I won&apos;t<br/>be listening to them myself. (I&apos;d have to switch the modem to my Mac and<br/>stuff).</p><p>JdL, keep up the great work on the adaptive tuner.</p><p>Paul E., I know that people pay you money to point out their errors. Thanks<br/>for doing it for us for free!</p><p>Jerry E., just because your theory is beautiful doesn&apos;t mean it necessarily<br/>bears any resemblance to reality. This may be so in Physics, but not in<br/>Psychoacoustics. I&apos;ve had to adjust mine many times since joining this<br/>list. Please take advantage of the generous people on this list to help you<br/>perform experiments to test your theories with accurate measurements, or<br/>accurate synthesis and good ears.</p><p>Graham Breed, I&apos;m glad to be able to leave the defense and development of<br/>the &quot;Fokker-plus&quot; interval names in your capable hands. When you get to<br/>write it up including the wide/narrow extension, please email it to me, or<br/>its URL. Could you post your schismic? letter # b / \ notation for 22-tET<br/>alongside your Fokker-plus interval names.</p><p>Anyone else waiting for a response from me on something?</p><p>Thanks to everyone.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>About the definition of &quot;microtemperament&quot;<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>Note that I intended it to be a (more generally acceptable and<br/>self-explanatory) synonym for &quot;wafso-just&quot;. I earlier wrote:</p><p>&quot;The point of microtempering an otherwise strictly-just scale is to<br/>increase the number of available consonances while keeping the errors close<br/>to the limit of tuning accuracy for non-electronic instruments and less<br/>than half those of meantone (which is sometimes considered quasi-just).&quot;</p><p>Two important points in there.<br/>1. A microtemperament is a microtemperament _of_ something, namely some<br/>strictly-Just scale (or at least some odd-limit lattice).</p><p>2. The errors (possibly weighted in some way) are less than some maximum<br/>value. I earlier wrote, &quot;less than half those of meantone&quot;. This was for a<br/>minimax errors tempering of an 11-limit scale. I might want to let this<br/>creep up a bit.</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s too early to lay down a precise upper limit. But I think that no<br/>ET less than 72-tET should be considered a microtemperament of anything<br/>7-limit or higher. I would say that 72-tET is a microtemperament of 7-limit<br/>(2.98 c max error), but not 9-limit (3.91 c max error).</p><p>I want my 11-limit tunings with distributed 224:225 and 384:385<br/>(particularly the one that has minimax beats in the 4:5:6:7:9:11, TD<br/>485.12) to be considered a microtemperament.</p><p>So if it&apos;s to be unweighted, the cutoff&apos;s gotta be between 3.3 c and 3.9 c.<br/>But It really needs some weighting that doesn&apos;t allow such large errors in<br/>the more complex intervals. Minimax beats in a complete (stack-of-&quot;thirds&quot;)<br/>otonality, means the errors are effectively weighted by the highest LCM of<br/>the interval as it occurs in the extended ratio of that chord. e.g. 2:3&apos;s<br/>occur as 4:6 and 6:9 so they would be weighted by LCM(6,9) = 18, while 9:11<br/>would be weighted by LCM(9,11) = 99.</p><p>Graham, the definition you proposed is a definition of what might better be<br/>called a &quot;planar temperament&quot;, by extension from &quot;linear temperament&quot;. In<br/>that way of thinking, ETs are &quot;point temperaments&quot;, but &quot;closed<br/>temperaments&quot; is probably a better term.</p><p>Of course most microtemperaments are planar temperaments. This should<br/>certainly be mentioned in any definition of either term, but I see no need<br/>to identify the two.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
