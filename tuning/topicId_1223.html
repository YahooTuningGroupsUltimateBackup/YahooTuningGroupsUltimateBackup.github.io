I&apos;m working with this temperament and so far I just<br/>indicate the cents deviation above or below each note.  Say +17&#xFFFD;; -33&#xFFFD;;<br/>-50&#xFFFD; etc.<br/>RT</p></div><h3><a id=35390 href="#35390">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/8/2002 6:06:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 3/8/02 8:42:15 PM Eastern Standard Time, <a href="mailto:joemonz@yahoo.com">joemonz@yahoo.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; i feel compelled to mention yet again, as i have here<br/>&gt; many times before, that Ezra Sims, the composer whose<br/>&gt; 72edo notation has been adopted/adapted as the new standard<br/>&gt; here, has stated both in published writings and in private<br/>&gt; letters to me that he has made &quot;computer mock-ups&quot; of his<br/>&gt; compositions tuned in   b o t h   72edo  a n d  37-limit JI<br/>&gt; and he can&apos;t hear a significant difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Why so compelled?  So what?  I&apos;ve known Ezra for years and we have been warm<br/>and cold with each other at various times.  My introduction to his string<br/>quartet (but which is not a string quartet since it has a clarinet) made me<br/>realize he is a bit of a card.  He is not a performing musicians.  Maybe<br/>players hear more acutely than other musicians, let alone other people.  Why<br/>do you suppose they are performing musicians?  How do you think they survive<br/>if they cannot hear acutely?\</p><p>Ezra Sims once wrote a piece that had J.S. Bach in Just.  That was just fine<br/>for him.  For me it was puke, and I was playing.  Temperament ripped from the<br/>music of Bach is bad enough, but the sound was soul-less, nude, totally<br/>un-Bach.  But hey, Ezra liked it.  During rehearsals he threatened the<br/>percussionists, saying he would walk up on stage and grab their sticks from<br/>them during the performance.  (This was probably more shtick than stick, but<br/>many of the musicians were offended.)   And I called him on it.  And then we<br/>had a warming period which has continued to this day.  Ezra has come to a<br/>number of the Microtonal Symposia we have done in New York.</p><p>But that he can&apos;t tell 72 from JI (when in his mind he wants JI anyway)...so<br/>what?  I have no trouble telling an equal temperament from JI.  It&apos;s in the<br/>texture.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=35418 href="#35418">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2002 9:43:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Why do you suppose they are performing musicians?

There are scads of &quot;performing musicians&quot; that<br/>make a living that not only don&apos;t hear acutely, but couldn&apos;t find an<br/>A=440 with a geiger counter!!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
