General  admission is $12 at the door, $10 for seniors<br/>and students.<br/>Saturday &ndash; May 15th &ndash; spotlights Madeleine Shapiro&lsquo;s performance of Ge<br/>Gan-Ru&lsquo;s YI-SENG (Lost Style) for solo amplified cello scordatura  (Shanghai,<br/>1968). 10-year old twin Gayageum players Sarah and Stephanie Yoon present the<br/>traditional  Korean standard known as SANJO on their 12-string instruments<br/>in its ancient microtonal tuning (think &ldquo;whammy-bar&rdquo; zithers).  Also,<br/>25-string Gayageum virtuoso Rami Seo introduces her NEXUS in confluence with<br/>flute (Sasha Bogdanowitsch), bassoon (Johnny Reinhard), cello (Madeleine<br/>Shapiro), and Terpstra synthesizer (Joshua Pierce).  The Terpstra synthesizer, a<br/>honeycomb  keyboard design of 55 tones per octave over 5 octaves, is heard<br/>publicly in its debut this  evening.  It is played by Joshua Pierce in a<br/>53-tone equal  temperament rendition of Arnold  Schoenberg&rsquo;s DREI KLAVIERSTUCKE,<br/>as imagined by  the composer.<br/>Sasha Bogdanowitsch premieres SILK for a multitude of instruments, many<br/>homemade,<br/>for a theatrical jaunt, joined by Sarah and Stephanie Yoon.  There is a<br/>rare performance of  Renaissance microtonalist Nicola  Vicentino entitled<br/>MUSICA PRISCA CAPUT for a SATB vocal  quartet (TBD, Maya Galt, Brendan Glynn, and<br/>Johnny Reinhard); Vicentino actually  placed dots above note heads to<br/>signify raising the pitch by an interval smaller  than a quartertone.  Johnny<br/>Reinhard concludes the evening  with the premiere of CAMBIA for bassoon and 3<br/>Gayageums  based on the underwater archaeology in Gujarat, India reputed to<br/>be 9,500 years  old.  The tuning is intentionally  polymicrotonal in that all<br/>intervallic relationships may be employed.<br/>Additionally, there are now 6 new PITCH CD titles, a new book by Johnny<br/>Reinhard entitled BACH AND TUNING, and a Finale score of  the Charles Ives<br/>UNIVERSE SYMPHONY available on the  AFMM&rsquo;s website:         http/www.afmm.org</p></div><h3><a id=86963 href="#86963">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/9/2010 6:48:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

It sounds like you achieved a &apos;moment&apos;<br/>with the audience, which is so refreshing.  (Lots of other cool<br/>stuff on this CD too.)</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=86971 href="#86971">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@...</h3><span>3/9/2010 6:38:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mark,</p><p>There is only one working Terpstra synth which is being developed by<br/>Harvestworks in NYC, after spending some time at the Aaron Copland School&apos;s<br/>computer room (Queens College).  Joel Mandelbaum consented to have the  famed<br/>Harvestworks (P.A.S.S. Studios) develop timbres, etc. for our upcoming<br/>concert.</p><p>Alas, Joshua Pierce is not comfortable with transitioning his piano<br/>training to the synth honeycomb design.  We will still present the synth,<br/>regardless, in an improvisation with a Gayageum work by Rami Seo.</p><p>And Carl, thanks for your kind sentiments on the WORLD album.  The  albums<br/>are only beginning to be released in the U.S., although they are on  CDBaby.</p><p>Yes, Mark certainly was electrifying in his performance.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
