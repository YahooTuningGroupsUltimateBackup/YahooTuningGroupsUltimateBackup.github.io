By the way, Busoni would probably have no qualms about<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; writing an Ab for a G# or vice-versa.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; I wouldn&apos;t be too hasty to assert that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Even tho (AFAIK) Busoni left no microtonal compositions,<br/>&gt;&gt; theoretically, he was an advocate of 36-tET/-EDO.<br/>&gt;&gt; (see Busoni 1962, p 93-95)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [Paul]<br/>&gt; That doesn&apos;t matter. 36-tET has the basic structural intervals<br/>&gt; of tonal music (fifths and thirds) in exactly the same tuning<br/>&gt; as 12-tET. Therefore, Ab and G# are unequivocally the same<br/>&gt; in 36-tET. Busoni wasn&apos;t after restoring the subtle pitch<br/>&gt; distinction of the meantone era. He was satisfied with his<br/>&gt; Bach in 12-tET. 36-tET was meant to be an expansion for<br/>&gt; future music, not past music.</p><p>OK, those are both good points.</p><p>But still, 36-tET *does* provide 2^(23/36) = ~767 cents,<br/>which is a pretty good approximation of 16:25 = ~773 cents,<br/>and which I would be tempted to use in some of Busoni/Bach&apos;s<br/>&apos;augmented chords&apos;.</p><p>The other possibility, 2^25/36 = ~833 cents, doesn&apos;t have<br/>as obvious a cognate in 5-limit JI, the only ones close<br/>enough being 16384/10125 = (3^-4)*(5^-3) = ~833 cents and<br/>its schismatic relative 81/25 = (3^4)*(5^-2) = ~835 cents.<br/>I say that these are not as obvious because they&apos;re quite<br/>far from 1/1, and thus would most likely only be implied<br/>in a fairly large set of pitches; unless &apos;extended-reference&apos;<br/>comes into play (heh heh...).</p><p>Do you have a reference that confirms that Busoni &apos;was<br/>satisfied with his Bach in 12-tET&apos;?</p><p>Altho not tuning-related, I would like to point out that<br/>Busoni made a &apos;concert arrangement&apos; of the 2nd of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>_3 Piano Pieces, op 11_ (changing &apos;octave&apos;-registration, etc.,<br/>to make it &apos;more pianistic&apos;, and for which he was severely<br/>criticized by Schoenberg), indicating that he had no problem<br/>with producing his own version of &apos;past music&apos;, even when<br/>the composer was still alive.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

Since the 16:25 would be constructed out of two 4:5s, and since<br/>each 4:5 would best be tuned @ 400&#xFFFD;, the 16:25 (not being a consonant<br/>interval or one recongnizable on its own) automatically gets assigned the<br/>800&#xFFFD; tuning.</p><p>&gt;I say that these are not as obvious because they&apos;re quite<br/>&gt;far from 1/1, and thus would most likely only be implied<br/>&gt;in a fairly large set of pitches; unless &apos;extended-reference&apos;<br/>&gt;comes into play (heh heh...).</p><p>Extended reference requires JI and strictly speaking, could not operate in<br/>36-tET. Speaking more loosely, in 36-tET, each link in the chain of<br/>reference would be forced to its nearest approximation, which (for the<br/>5-limit case we&apos;re discussing) would end up limiting you to 12-tET.</p><p>&gt;Do you have a reference that confirms that Busoni &apos;was<br/>&gt;satisfied with his Bach in 12-tET&apos;?</p><p>I think the burden of proof is on the other side, given what Busoni did with<br/>Bach and the time in which he lived.</p></div>
