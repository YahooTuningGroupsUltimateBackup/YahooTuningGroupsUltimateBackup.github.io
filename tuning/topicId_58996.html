They are often mixed (as in common practice 5 limit &gt;with its chains of many fifths but only up to two thirds), but only an &gt;interval constellation arrived at by division would be pure JI (divide &gt;the octave: 3/2 and 4/3; divide each of these: 5/4 and 6/5 and 7/6 and &gt;8/7; divide the 5/4: 9/8 and 10/9). I think that no interval is &gt;repeated. Now compare it to a chain of fifths. There are only two &gt;different intervals; the first division is identical, the second &gt;division can be mapped to different interval sizes; but the 10/9 is &gt;mapped to another 9/8, so the &quot;imitation of justness&quot; fails at this &gt;point. For the 5/4 and 7/6, you&apos;d acknowledge the attempt and call it &gt;just as well, but add badly tuned or well enough or something of that &gt;sort.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I thought this was uniqueness, but it isn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=59000 href="#59000">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/8/2005 11:04:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; There is something to what you felt implied in my post.<br/>&gt;  Most JI scales involve more than one generator , But we cannot say<br/>they<br/>&gt; have too.</p><p>If they don&apos;t have more than one generator, then to get much of a<br/>scale the best way would seem to be to for the generator should give<br/>an approximate equal temperament.

In that at a certain point there is a tendency to add<br/>generating<br/>&gt; intervals to fill in the gaps.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t seem like a very good method of gap-filling. Why wouldn&apos;t<br/>the tendency be to fill the gaps via the generators already in use?</p><p>&gt;  I think more is gained by keeping them developing along the lines they<br/>&gt; do and where they meet with others, so be it. But that doesn&apos;t mean we<br/>&gt; should call them the same thing.<br/>&gt;  If they truly were, we would not discussing the differences here.</p><p>Certainly a rank 3 subgroup of the reals under multiplication is in<br/>some sense the same sort of thing as another such subgroup. However,<br/>if one subgroup consists solely of rational numbers, that *is* the<br/>difference. It isn&apos;t a difference in the structure of the group, but a<br/>difference in that rational numbers are usually (but with exceptions,<br/>like Lucy) considered normative. If you define a regular temperament<br/>by a mapping *from* a group of rational numbers, then when the mapping<br/>is trivial, it&apos;s clearly different than when it isn&apos;t. It seems to me<br/>you could define this &quot;structural&quot; JI not in terms of the image of the<br/>mapping, which is tuning, but purely by the mapping. If the mapping is<br/>an isomorphism, then we have &quot;JI&quot;; if not, even if the numbers in<br/>question are all rational numbers, we don&apos;t.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we start with 5-limit JI. We could have</p><p>2--&gt;2, 3--&gt;3, 5--&gt;5; this would be &quot;just intonation&quot;.</p><p>2--&gt;2, 3--&gt;3, 5--&gt;24/5; this transforms major to minor. Asking if this<br/>counts as &quot;just intonation&quot; isn&apos;t even a question for most people, but<br/>from this point of view it has to be asked.</p><p>2--&gt;2, 3--&gt;32768/10935, 5--&gt;2^15 3^(-7) 5^(-1); despite the fact that<br/>the mapping is from the 5-limit and to the 5-limit, like the<br/>major/minor transformation above, this clearly is not JI and in fact<br/>is a disguised form of 12-et.</p><p>2--&gt;2, 3--&gt;5^(1/4), 5--&gt;5; this is 1/4 comma meantone, not JI.</p><p>2--&gt;2, 3--&gt;2^(49/31), 5--&gt;2^(72/31); in spite of the fact that this<br/>maps to a rank one group, most likely it would be used more or less<br/>like the 1/4 comma meantone mapping. Again, not JI.</p><p>2--&gt;2, 3--&gt;2^(1623/1024), 5--&gt;2^(114127/49152); this is the 5-limit<br/>interpreted in terms of pitch bends. Structurally, we pay no attention<br/>to this mapping, and do not consider it to be in effect. Instead, we<br/>consider the result of pitch bending to be JI.</p><p>Note that the above definition does not depend on what the actual<br/>measured pitch is, but what the mapping intends for it to be. It gets<br/>around the problem of defining &quot;JI&quot; purely in terms of the tuning, and<br/>therefore has no problem rejecting many counterexamples as not being<br/>JI, such as the pseudo 12-et above. However, it now asks the new and<br/>slightly goofy question of whether playing a major key piece notated<br/>in 5-limit JI but transposing to a minor key still counts as JI, since<br/>you are playing the wrong third.</p></div>
