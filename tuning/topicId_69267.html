The mapping is restricted to a maximum of 12<br/>degrees per octave.</p><p>2) open and playback midi files. During playback you can switch forth<br/>and back between temperaments. The retuned midi file can be saved<br/>seperately.</p><p>3) improved and much easier configuration setup</p><p>Keep in mind that the goal of the program is not to offer the most<br/>advanced options in microtuning nor the most elaborate virtual organ,<br/>but a simple program that provides the experience of microtuning to<br/>all musicians or music students. (A friend of my has a rather advanced<br/>education as an organist, but never had any experience with, say,<br/>quarter meantone). I would like very much to have this program used in<br/>music schools.</p><p>I included some example mp3 files that I created with JMTOrgan and<br/>Synthfont: the 22nd prelude of WTC1 in B-flat minor - In my opinion,<br/>Werckmeister III is not well suited for this prelude. The friction is<br/>at the wrong places. I prefer Lehman&apos;s temperament to which I keep<br/>tuning my (real) harpsichord.  (I am sure there must have been a large<br/>deal of discussions on this temperament on the list.)</p><p>see: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jeroendonkers/JMTOrgan/examples.html">http://www.geocities.com/jeroendonkers/JMTOrgan/examples.html</a></p><p>The piece by William Byrd sounds almost like magic in quarter meantime<br/>and is unbareable for me in equal temperament.</p><p>regards,</p><p>Jeroen Donkers</p></div><h3><a id=69270 href="#69270">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2007 9:31:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeroen Donkers wrote:</p><p>&gt; I included some example mp3 files that I created with JMTOrgan and<br/>&gt; Synthfont: the 22nd prelude of WTC1 in B-flat minor - In my opinion,<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III is not well suited for this prelude.

Actually, I&apos;ve been thinking this would be another good temperament comparison if we hadn&apos;t had so many of those already. I got as far as turning on the Record button in Cakewalk and realized it&apos;s been too long since the last time I played it, and I&apos;m out of practice. But I&apos;ve played this in Werckmeister III before and I remember what that sounded like. Not one of the best keys for that temperament, in my opinion.</p></div><h3><a id=69276 href="#69276">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2007 4:41:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jeroen Donkers wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I included some example mp3 files that I created with JMTOrgan and<br/>&gt; &gt; Synthfont: the 22nd prelude of WTC1 in B-flat minor - In my opinion,<br/>&gt; &gt; Werckmeister III is not well suited for this prelude.
