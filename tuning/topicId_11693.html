Paul mentioned the keyboard was the same as<br/>pictured here: <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm</a></p><p>I saw this one illustrated in a 1920s advertisement for a piano company!<br/>More<br/>intentionally, though, Sibyl Marcuse describes the same by Johann<br/>Rohleder in 1791, and continues that the design was used by several 19th<br/>century German piano makers; Owen Jorgensen presents it as the &quot;6 over<br/>6&quot; keyboard.</p><p>I found a reference to the Rapian Keyboard in one of Paul Vandervoort&apos;s<br/>patents (relating to Paul von Janko&apos;s keyboard), and managed to scrounge<br/>an issue of Keyboard Magazine with a short feature written by Bob Moog<br/>(p18. Keyboard, Sept. 1989). Kanpei Mutoh&apos;s 12-tone arrangement has 5<br/>tiers of<br/>tall, medium size button keys - like the symmetrical arrangements each<br/>tier plays a whole tone scale. Positions are marked on the fallboard. It<br/>looks to have reduced octave span, and part of its reason is natural<br/>finger placement.</p><p>While on the subject, I emailed with an instrument builder in WA who is<br/>constructing a strung piano-like keyboard instrument which will allow<br/>for instantaneous retuning, along with vibrato and glissandi. Patent<br/>considerations kept him from describing it any further, but it sounds<br/>very exciting.</p><p>Clark</p></div>
