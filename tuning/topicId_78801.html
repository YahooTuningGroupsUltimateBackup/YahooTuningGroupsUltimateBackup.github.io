The idea is,<br/>you can define temperaments abstractly.  For instance,<br/>meantone temperament is the thing in which a major third<br/>is composed of four perfect fifths minus 2 octaves.  This<br/>+4 -2 mapping lets you reach any rational number that can<br/>be composed of the primes 2, 3, and 5 by using an<br/>arrangement of only two generators (the octave and fifth),<br/>hence it has &quot;smaller rank&quot;.</p><p>A tuning of meantone temperament is reached simply by<br/>choosing sizes for the fifth and octave (e.g. 697 cents<br/>and 1201 cents).  Finally, one applies these &quot;generators&quot;<br/>to get a scale of the desired number of tones/octave.</p><p>This setup has proven to be very fertile, in terms of<br/>turning up dozens of temperaments like meantone yet...<br/>different, each with their optimal tunings (much like<br/>31-ET is about optimal for meantone) and characteristic<br/>nested series of scales (e.g. 5-tone, 7-tone, 12-tone etc.).</p><p>I also think it works quite well as a generalization of<br/>the common and historical use of these terms.  However,<br/>as you point out, the terms are not used consistently, so<br/>in some cases it&apos;s hard to say.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2008 7:55:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Far as I know...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Temperament is the ability to estimate a scale from slightly above or below&nbsp;a desired scale and still have it sound/feel relatively the same.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, 12 tone equal temperament is designed to estimate different transpositions/modulations of the 7-note Just Intonation Diatonic scale and each note is off by a few cents over or under the desired note (IE not off by much).<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp; Far as tuning vs. scale...I am not sure, I have always thought of them as synonyms.&nbsp; I would be curious to learn the authoritative differences between them.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp; The term &quot;Intonation&quot; itself, to be honest, I have no clue about.&nbsp; All I know it just intonation locks notes in a scale to match possible harmonic overtones in a very precise fashion, resulting in something very &quot;relaxed sounding&quot; to most people.</p><p>&nbsp;<br/>--- On Wed, 11/5/08, Daniel Forro &lt;<a href="mailto:dan.for@tiscali.cz">dan.for@tiscali.cz</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Daniel Forro &lt;dan.for@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: scale vs. tuning etc<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, November 5, 2008, 9:08 PM</p><p>I have mentioned in some messages here very often terms &quot;scale&quot;,<br/>&quot;intonation&quot; , &quot;temperament&quot; , &quot;tuning&quot; (somebody can add more?) are<br/>used chaotically, inconsistently and not in exact way.

Only 6 of the 24 preludes and fugues<br/>stick to as few as 12 notes...and it&apos;s a different 12 notes every<br/>time.  All the others go out to 13, 14, 15, 17, or 25 notes: forcing<br/>musicians (players and tuners being the same people!) to deal with<br/>enharmonic swaps.  The diagram then shows how to do that: set up all<br/>the notes of the C major scale first, and then fit the remaining<br/>notes into their enharmonically proper places with these specific<br/>adjustments, so the whole book of music can be played.</p><p>The lecture started from the basics of diatonic-scale construction,<br/>showing why meantone is the way it is.  (It is necessary to<br/>understand what a problem is, before seeking solutions to it!)  I<br/>assumed that nobody in the audience had read the corresponding<br/>section (pp 214-220) of my original paper, or understood why those<br/>concepts of the enharmonic swaps are important in Bach&apos;s music.  The<br/>people who have argued most loudly against my hypothesis over the<br/>past three years -- some in print, and some here in this and other<br/>internet forums -- have all got stuck with their own negativity about<br/>other sections.  Nobody goes into this crucial area of the notes<br/>actually called for by Bach&apos;s compositions!  It&apos;s personally<br/>frustrating that the nay-sayers have missed the point THAT BADLY.</p><p>So, in this lecture for JMU, I started fresh.  I started with the<br/>assumption that anybody showing up would be open-minded about music,<br/>and open-minded about learning things they don&apos;t &quot;know&quot;, and willing<br/>to learn how the C major scale is put together, and how modulation<br/>works.  The lecture didn&apos;t require anybody to do any math, or to read<br/>music scores.  I showed why harpsichord tuning is done by 5ths/4ths.<br/>I showed why meantone schemes typically give the notes they do, and<br/>omit the notes they do.  I showed how notes such as E-flat and D-<br/>sharp are remarkably different from one another in actual pitch<br/>(demonstrated live at the harpsichords), and showed how compromises<br/>must be found between those spots.  I showed the problem that Bach&apos;s<br/>music *itself* sets up, and showed why I believe Bach&apos;s own solution<br/>to his problem was such-and-such.</p><p>It&apos;s all very easy to &quot;get&quot; by people who come to it with ears and<br/>minds willing to listen, not wrapped up in their own argumentation.<br/>Look at it as shapes, the same way a one-year-old knows how to build<br/>a successful tower of irregular blocks without having to measure the<br/>angles or calculate a single thing.  The audience was mostly<br/>undergraduate music students, their professors, and a few guests.  It<br/>was probably &quot;new&quot; to most people there that F-sharp and G-flat are<br/>not the same note, so I started from the basics.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/11/2008 12:55:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>Hi Tom, Brad and all others<br/>that try to study Brad&apos;s reinterpretation attempts in vain,</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; All I want is *one* real new piece of information or<br/>&gt; &gt; not-completely-subjective insight.

A note such as Eb&#x19;- is a<br/>comma higher than its partner Db&#x19;/, and if the wrong one is performed it<br/>offends the ear. Furthermore, appoggiaturas and other passing notes<br/>must always use the correct diatonic (not chromatic) notes of the<br/>current harmony.37 Each time we pass through 12 consecutive 5ths, we<br/>arrive a comma higher or lower than our previous position. That is,<br/>the basic standard of intonation is a spiralling scale of regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6<br/>comma 5ths, also known as the 55-division of the octave, where commas<br/>are the individual tiny steps of this scale. The diatonic semitone and<br/>chromatic semitone are in 5:4 ratio within a tone whose size is 9<br/>commas. Therefore, of the 55 equal parts of the octave, the notes are<br/>placed on the keyboard as follows: C=0, Cb&#x19;/=4, D=9, Eb&#x19;-=14, E=18, F=23,<br/>Fb&#x19;/=27, G=32, Gb&#x19;/=36, A=41, Bb&#x19;-=46, B=50, C=55.38 Other important notes<br/>missing from a regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 comma keyboard include Db&#x19;-= 5,Db&#x19;/=13, Eb&#x19;/=22,<br/>Gb&#x19;-=28, Ab&#x19;-=37, Ab&#x19;/=45, Cb&#x19;-=51, Bb&#x19;/=54. Sauveur, Quantz, Telemann, Leopold<br/>Mozart and other 18th-century musicians confirm this same standard in<br/>both practice and pedagogy.39 A close reading of Quantz&apos;s chapter &apos;On<br/>the Duties of Those Who Accompany a Concertante Part&apos;40 suggests that<br/>only the accidentals are exceptionally tempered on keyboards (i.e.<br/>outside the equal comma points of the 55-division), while the naturals<br/>are regular.41</p><p>What does this tell us? If possible, let us put ourselves for the<br/>moment inside the heads of exceptionally good 18th-century performers,<br/>such as Tartini or Tosi or Quantz, and bring our instruments and<br/>voices to a harpsichord in some temperament. As we try to sing or play<br/>with it, does it sound in tune or out of tune with our expectations<br/>and our normal handling of commas? Does the harpsichord have any notes<br/>that make a jarring effect by being a comma or more too high or low,<br/>according to our standard of spiralling &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 comma 5ths across the<br/>entire 25-note range from Eb&#x19;-b&#x19;-Bb&#x19;-;b&#x19;-Fb&#x19;-Cb&#x19;-etc.<br/>CGetc.Fb&#x19;/Cb&#x19;/etc.Bb&#x19;/F&times;C&times;? Or are the compromises easy to find,<br/>moderate, and comfortable for one&apos;s own performance (whether one tries<br/>to match them exactly or not)?</p><p>Such a thing is easily measurable, and a useful way to analyse a<br/>temperament&apos;s suitability for tonal music, but to my knowledge it has<br/>not been published before. In the tuning literature, the measurements<br/>we usually see are deviations in cents from equal temperament,42 which<br/>is irrelevant by the 18th-century non-keyboard standard.</p><p>The notes on a standard 12-note keyboard must serve double duty, well<br/>or badly as the case may be, in all the enharmonic contexts required<br/>of them: this is a basic expectation of circulating temperament. Here<br/>are comparative examples of various temperaments, next to Bach&apos;s. All<br/>the notes are measured from their positions in the 55-division system,<br/>i.e. a double cycle of regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 PC (or &sup2;b&#x1;&#x4;11 SC), with the common<br/>note C always at 0 per cent.</p><p>See table 1. The main things to notice here are the comma errors of<br/>the less common accidentals, [End Page 214] i.e.the top row of<br/>percentages in each. A positive percentage shows the amount by which<br/>that note is too sharp, and a negative percentage shows flatness. Some<br/>observations from the chart:</p><p>In regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 comma, the 12 main notes from Eb&#x19;- toGb&#x19;/ are all exactly<br/>in tune (0 per cent comma deviation) and the other 12 are 100 per cent<br/>comma either too high or low. This confirms Tosi&apos;s pedagogical<br/>analysis of the situation: for example, where the music says &apos;Db&#x19;-&apos;, if<br/>we took our pitch from the keyboard, we are singing it 100 per cent of<br/>a comma too low, because the keyboard has it tuned primarily as a Cb&#x19;/.<br/>Comparison of enharmonic treatment<br/>Click for larger view &#x9;Table 1<br/>Comparison of enharmonic treatment</p><p>In equal temperament, enharmonics are organized symmetrically in pairs<br/>outward from C in [End Page 215]both directions. Because the<br/>progression around the 5ths is smooth and steady, no single notes ever<br/>stick out as &apos;wrong&apos;. The sharps are increasingly bright (and<br/>uncommonly high in general) while the flats are mellow (being only a<br/>few positions around the spiral of 5ths from C). Db&#x19;- and Ab&#x19;- are quite<br/>well in tune, while their counterparts Cb&#x19;/ and Gb&#x19;/ are much higher in<br/>their own contexts; this creates an effect of brilliance in sharp-key<br/>music.</p><p>Bach&apos;s temperament progresses outward from C, with the sharps rising<br/>more quickly than the corresponding lowering of the flats. This is its<br/>most unusual feature, and the reason why it works so uncommonly well<br/>for tonal music. Its crossover point of 50 per cent is at Cb&#x19;//Db&#x19;-; i.e.<br/>exactly half way, as major 3rds between A below and F above. Db&#x19;-<br/>therefore sounds suave (not quite wide enough from F to be harsh),<br/>while Cb&#x19;/ is exciting (very noticeably sharp, e.g. in D minor context).<br/>This temperament favours Ab&#x19;- ahead of Gb&#x19;/; again emphasizing the<br/>smoothness of the flat and the brilliant colour of thesharp. Six of<br/>the seven naturals are exactly in tune, making it easy for our singer<br/>or instrumentalist to find them; the only exceptional attention must<br/>be paid to the treatment of accidentals, being some portion of a comma<br/>too high or low, in a smoothly organized pattern outward.</p><p>&apos;Vallotti&apos; also has a smooth and symmetric progression in both<br/>directions, and it obviously favours the quality of the 12 main notes<br/>from Eb&#x19;- to Gb&#x19;/. Gb&#x19;//Ab&#x19;- is the crossover point of 50 per cent; Db&#x19;- and Gb&#x19;-<br/>quickly become quite harsh in tonal contexts, as is familiar to<br/>keyboardists who play in this temperament frequently. (Music in C<br/>minor, F minor and Ab&#x19;- major brings out some of the melodic flatness of<br/>those notes.) All seven naturals are exactly in tune by the<br/>55-division standard, and the accidentals rise or fall gradually.</p><p>Sorge 1758 has a pattern similar to Bach&apos;s, but starts the rise and<br/>fall closer to C in each direction. Cb&#x19;/ is slightly lower (more settled<br/>as a major 3rd above A), at the expense of quality in the Db&#x19;-. Again<br/>compared with Bach&apos;s, this temperament has the trade-off of slightly<br/>faster-beating major 3rds CE, FA and GB, for the benefit of more<br/>harmonious EGb&#x19;/, ACb&#x19;/ and BDb&#x19;/, while preserving the same overall<br/>shape. In practice it sounds like the musical meeting of<br/>unequal-temperament expert Bach with equal-temperament expert Sorge<br/>(two consecutive members of the Mizler society in 1747), coming to the<br/>complex problem of tonal music from opposite sides and striking a<br/>brilliantly tuned compromise.</p><p>&apos;Werckmeister III&apos; and &apos;Kellner&apos; share a serious problem in their<br/>treatment of melody, vis-&agrave;-vis the 55-division. This phenomenon,<br/>precisely, is the reason why these temperaments can seem so<br/>arbitrarily and suddenly sour when normal tonal music is played in<br/>them. Specifically, the notes Db&#x19;-, Gb&#x19;- and C&amp;#9837; are placed much too low,<br/>and Db&#x19;/ and Ab&#x19;/ too high. Harshness shows up in the Pythagorean major<br/>3rds (actually the misspelled diminished 4ths) Cb&#x19;/F, Fb&#x19;/Bb&#x19;-, BEb&#x19;- and<br/>Gb&#x19;/C, the legacy of regular mean-tone layouts; but it also appears in<br/>melodic contexts having nothing to do with major 3rds. Melodic leaps<br/>up or down to A&#x9;837; and Db&#x19;- can come across like singing with poor breath<br/>support as the tuning of these notes is so unexpectedly low. But, so<br/>is the note A in the simple melody FAC!43 The misspelled notes<br/>simply stick out obtrusively, because their deviations from the<br/>55-division skip across the set of notes rather than being<br/>well-organized outward from C. In Werckmeister III, the C and Fb&#x19;/(!)<br/>are best in tune; then the G, E and B. Then, the F, D and Cb&#x19;/; and so<br/>forth, leaping in ways that are not intuitively obvious. How are our<br/>singer and instrumentalist to find their pitches accurately, when the<br/>deviation patterns on the keyboard are clustered around both C and Fb&#x19;/?</p><p>These latter two temperaments have plenty of faithful and enthusiastic<br/>fans, especially due to the way they sound reasonably good in earlier<br/>music (based mostly on regular mean-tone layouts). But it cannot be<br/>denied that their melodic bumpiness borders on the effect of<br/>randomness, by the 18th-century standard itself. I suspect that<br/>musical ears more readily tolerate notes that are slightly sharp than<br/>notes that are noticeably flat within melodies.44 I cannot explain<br/>that phenomenon adequately. I can, however, offer a suggestion as to<br/>the technical cause of this problem in Werckmeister III.</p><p>In a well-known remark in his New Grove &apos;Well-tempered clavier&apos;<br/>article, Lindley has observed that Werckmeister III was probably<br/>designed for theconversion of existing organs from regular [End Page<br/>216] quarter-comma mean-tone. Some of the pipes of each octave can be<br/>left at or near their original pitch, and the conversion will take<br/>less work and expense. Direct examination of frequency charts, always<br/>keeping C constant, shows that Werckmeister&apos;s scheme (by this<br/>hypothesis) is even more clever than that; it allows conversion from<br/>any of the regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;4, &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;5 and &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 layouts by keeping C along with<br/>three or four other notes. These notes need to be moved a smaller<br/>distance than 2.5 cents (i.e. only an easy revoicing):<br/>&sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 syntonic: leave C, Cb&#x19;/, Fb&#x19;/, G, B<br/>&sup1;&amp;#8260;6 Pythagorean: leave C, E, Fb&#x19;/, G, B<br/>&sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;5 syntonic: leave C, E, Fb&#x19;/, G<br/>&sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;5 Pythagorean: leave C, D, E, G<br/>&sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;4 syntonic: leave C, D, G, A</p><p>Viewed from this angle, the axis of CFb&#x19;/ also makes additional sense.<br/>Fb&#x19;/ is left at or near its position from regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 comma temperament,<br/>namely the tritone 45b&#x1;&#x4;32 above C, one syntonic comma flat! The<br/>temperament begins with CFBb&#x19;-Eb&#x19;-Ab&#x19;-Db&#x19;- Gb&#x19;- pure 5ths, establishing<br/>&apos;F&#x9;839;&apos; at one Pythagorean comma below C. Therefore the six remaining<br/>5ths from C up to Fb&#x19;/ must absorb 100 per cent of this comma amongst<br/>themselves, since we have not done any tempering yet. The assignment<br/>of quarter-PC tempering to CGDA and to BFb&#x19;/ is simply the pattern<br/>that allows the most purity to be preserved in C, G, D and F majors<br/>without making the major third CE flatter than pure, and it is only<br/>coincidental that this spacing is a quarter of a [Pythagorean] comma.<br/>It is not really a quarter-comma temperament, in most of its organization.</p><p>It appears to me (revising Lindley&apos;s hypothesis) that the main purpose<br/>of this temperament is to convert regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 or &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;5 comma organs, not<br/>quarter-comma organs. Werckmeister himself had already remarked about<br/>the circulating temperament shape we know as &apos;Vallotti&apos; (&sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 comma<br/>tempered 5ths FCGDAEB), referring to it as an ordinary Venetian<br/>temperament, in 1681: long before Vallotti, Tartini or Barca did.45<br/>Furthermore, Werckmeister IV is even more obviously a conversion<br/>temperament, squaring off regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 Pythagorean comma and splitting<br/>its wolf in two; and Werckmeister V isa conversion of regular &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;o?=&agrave;<br/>Pythagorean comma. Inthis perspective, I believe it is plausible that<br/>the familiar Werckmeister III started from the premise that C and Fb&#x19;/<br/>should be left alone, and everything else arranged around them. The<br/>resulting shape of it, as I have demonstrated here, suggests as much:<br/>the Fb&#x19;/ and its nearest neighbours are serious liabilities in music<br/>that treats them enharmonically.</p><p>Kellner&apos;s temperament, in turn, was his attempt to take the model of<br/>Werckmeister III to the next steps that seemed logical to him,<br/>slightly moderating its intensity while keeping essentially the same<br/>pattern.46 Devie, Rasch and Lindley have offered perceptive further<br/>comments about Kellner&apos;s methods, which I need not repeat here.47 The<br/>resulting temperament has some attractive symmetries and balances for<br/>music that never strays far from the basic set of mean-tone notes, but<br/>it does not handle enharmonic equivalences gracefully; and therefore<br/>it sounds remarkably rough in Bach&apos;s music.</p><p>Buxtehude&apos;s extant organ music uses Gb&#x19;/, Db&#x19;/, Ab&#x19;/, Eb&#x19;/ and B&amp;#9839; with<br/>impunity, with occasional forays to F&times; and C&times;. On the flat side it<br/>goes only as far as Ab&#x19;- (which in context must be decent as a 5th<br/>against Eb&#x19;-) frequently, and there are only several pieces48 that use<br/>Db&#x19;-. That suggests to me that if Buxtehude&apos;s organ temperament(s) were<br/>regular, only something as light as &sup1;b&#x1;&#x4;6 comma makes musical sense;49<br/>and if irregular, having at least a compromised Gb&#x19;//Ab&#x19;- and perhaps also<br/>a lowered Eb&#x19;- and Bb&#x19;-.50 Werckmeister III fits very well for music that<br/>avoids the flats as thoroughly as Buxtehude&apos;s does. Saying the same<br/>thing in another way: Buxtehude&apos;s &aelig;uvre (as corroboration) makes<br/>Werckmeister III look like a practical method to convert regular &sup1;&amp;#8260;6<br/>comma &apos;mean-tone&apos; to smoother chromaticism, but only around the sharp<br/>side.</p><p>To summarize my remarks about enharmonics: any keyboard temperament as<br/>a candidate to play Bach&apos;s music must be able to handle all 25 notes<br/>from Eb&#x19;-b&#x19;- up to C&times;, gracefully and in a sequence that singers and<br/>instrumentalists can find without undue trouble. The same feature (and<br/>restriction) that makes a temperament good for accompaniment, namely<br/>its conformance to the 55-division, also makes it good for solo<br/>repertory, as the accidentals are constrained to be in moderate and<br/>logical positions. [End Page 217]</p><p>This is a prerequisite to vocal-sounding melodic contours: never<br/>having any individual notes that protrude too noticeably from their<br/>melodic and harmonic contexts, in steps and leaps. If the notes within<br/>scales are not absolutely regular, the irregularities must be<br/>tastefully subtle lest they begin to sound like mere errors from<br/>incompetence. This is a difficult balance to achieve. The 12 available<br/>pitches must be viewed (heard) from all possible angles, anddeliver<br/>something reasonable to every possible context.<br/>Ex.1 Intervals in Bach&apos;s temperament, measured melodically in cents:<br/>(a) tones; (b) semitones<br/>Click for larger view &#x9;Example 1<br/>Intervals in Bach&apos;s temperament, measured melodically in cents: (a)<br/>tones; (b) semitones<br/>Recognizable scales through the distinct intonation of their steps</p><p>As Ledbetter&apos;s book reminds us repeatedly, every key has a distinctive<br/>&apos;grip&apos; (Griff) in the player&apos;s hands. The player must learn to grasp<br/>them all, and the WTC provides terrific examples. As Bach&apos;s<br/>temperament makes clear, that distinctiveness in physical layout on<br/>the keyboard also has a counterpart in distinctive intonation patterns<br/>in every key.51 The contrasts, to the player, are not only<br/>psychological (from the physical Griff) but also audible. To the close<br/>listener (which is also a crucial component of playing), these<br/>differences in tension further affect phrasing and timing: perception<br/>of the motion in tonal music.</p><p>Why should it matter to have distinctive diatonic scales? The<br/>perceptible dimensionality of the music is multiplied. The playing of<br/>a keyboard fugue is the simultaneous control of three or four melodic<br/>shapes, and &apos;counterpoint&apos; and &apos;harmony&apos; are the complex interactions<br/>of those shapes. Modulation comes from the introduction of foreign<br/>notes (irregularities) into a melody&apos;s prevailing scale: the<br/>listener&apos;s mind notices the irritation and assigns the anomalous notes<br/>to whatever competing scale best contains them. Is that not the way<br/>basic human perception of language works: noticing irregularities in<br/>the flow of sound, and parsing the stream of input into meaningful<br/>packets by analogy with already known patterns?52</p><p>The mind is very good at dealing with unexpected and seemingly<br/>irrelevant stimuli, such as the mention of strawberries. When all the<br/>scales have distinctive aural signatures, as in Bach&apos;s temperament,<br/>the listener&apos;s task of parsing the music is much easier (especially<br/>when receiving several contrapuntal voices simultaneously).<br/>Furthermore, the mind is continually challenged by the dynamics of all<br/>this: attention is captured and maintained. Passive voice, active,<br/>tart strawberry, fragments, unorthograffy Violation of Expectations,<br/>just the right balance ofasymmetric contrasts and flow and purposeful<br/>irritation. In summary: when heard in a carefully balanced unequal<br/>temperament, the music is much more transparent, interesting, and<br/>engaging, all the way through.</p><p>Ex.1 shows all tones (&apos;whole steps&apos;) and semitones (&apos;half steps&apos;) of<br/>Bach&apos;s temperament, measured in cents.53 In my notation here, the<br/>notes are to be played in succession either ascending or descending,<br/>not crushed together simultaneously. The measurement here is of<br/>melodic quality.</p><p>There are four different sizes of tones and eight different sizes of<br/>semitones. That is: these linear intervals have a perceptibly<br/>different sound from one another, providing expressive inflections<br/>within melodies. At the same time, the differences are subtle enough<br/>that they do not draw undue attention or ruin melodic smoothness:<br/>listeners may choose to notice or ignore them as they wish.54 The<br/>differences are most noticeable when listening very closely at a<br/>harpsichord, in isolation, playing the notes slowly.

The 200 of AB is a coincidence from the raising of B,<br/>and the 202 of Fb&#x19;/G&#x9;839; and Bb&#x19;-C arise from the crossover points from one<br/>type of 5th into another.</p><p>In table 2 these steps are arranged into the four- and six-note<br/>subsets of the major and minor scales. The chart therefore describes<br/>all &apos;ut re mi&apos; and &apos;re mi fa&apos; combinations in Bach&apos;s temperament. In<br/>addition to being higher or lower in pitch, every scale sounds<br/>absolutely distinct from every other scale, dueto the different sizes<br/>and relationships of their intervals. Theeffect, or one might even say<br/>&apos;personality&apos;, of every musical key becomes recognizable. Compositions<br/>inherit this character from the home key (tonality) and any other<br/>major or minor keys the composer visits as the music moves along from<br/>section to section.</p><p>A tetrachord is a set of four rising notes in a major scale: ut, re,<br/>mi, fa. One can divide the complete scale [End Page 219] of eight<br/>notes into two halves: &apos;lower&apos; and &apos;upper&apos; tetrachords of four notes<br/>each:55 utremifa; utremifa (e.g. CDEF; GABC). The upper<br/>tetrachord GABC then begins the next scale, continuing DEFb&#x19;/G.<br/>The Fb&#x19;/ is the new note, and it gets a new (raised) key lever on the<br/>keyboard as wealready have an F. The new note each time is the mi of<br/>the upper tetrachord, tuned (as some size of fifth) from the already<br/>available mi of the lower tetrachord.56</p><p>The older system of hexachords uses the set of six rising notes: ut,<br/>re, mi, fa, sol, la.57 Like a complete major scale, a major hexachord<br/>(natural hexachord, hexachordum naturale) can also be broken down into<br/>halves: as &apos;ut re mi&apos; twice in succession. Similarly, aminor hexachord<br/>(soft hexachord, hexachordum molle) has &apos;re mi fa&apos; twice in<br/>succession. These two groups of three notes are mentioned in Bach&apos;s<br/>introduction to WTC: &apos;The Well-Tempered Clavier, or, preludes and<br/>fugues through all the tones and semitones, both as regards the tertia<br/>majoror ut re mi and as concerns the tertia minor or re mi fa.&apos;</p><p>The only symmetric major hexachord in Bach&apos;s temperament is<br/>CDEFGA. Its symmetry comes from the regular naturals: the home<br/>key of C major, &apos;ut re mi&apos;. The most nearly symmetric minor hexachords<br/>are similarly in the simplest &apos;re mi fa&apos; minor keys: DEFGABb&#x19;- and<br/>ABCDEF.58 That is: the keys with fewest accidentals are<br/>melodically the smoothest, having tones of equal size.</p><p>The most remarkable features in table 2 are the columns &apos;remi&apos; and<br/>&apos;mifa&apos; shared by the major and minor tetrachords. The lower and upper<br/>tetrachords to assemble each scale are distinct, in the paired<br/>qualities of those two melodic intervals &apos;remi&apos; followed by &apos;mifa&apos;.<br/>Listeners can therefore recognize any tonality immediately by its<br/>subtle &apos;remifa&apos; inflections, and hear an objective difference<br/>whenever the music modulates.59</p><p>Taking a step out to the big picture, to show the importance of this<br/>observation: all the scales are equally usable in musical quality, yet<br/>distinct. Transposition of any theme, any section, any entire piece<br/>causes a profound change in the relationships of all the intervals; an<br/>audible change of character in the music. There are exponentially<br/>increased musical resources available, compared with the assumption of<br/>equal temperament upon which so much of modern music theory is based.<br/>Change the melodic sizes of steps and leaps from a constant to a<br/>subtly variable parameter, and everything becomes fluid: more<br/>challenging to control analytically, but also more exciting. It is a<br/>world of sound-relationships, each with particular and recognizable<br/>identity. Pieces of tonal music ebb and flow organically, through<br/>their modulations of character.</p><p>Tonal theory will have to catch up with this, supplementing<br/>approximately 250 years of simplification. The choice of temperament<br/>(and this is true of all 12-note unequal temperaments, not only<br/>Bach&apos;s) is not independent of the content of a piece of music, at<br/>least where keyboards are concerned. The field of music theory has<br/>typically kept intervallic analysis and tuning details apart for<br/>convenience; all three-note and four-note chords with a particular<br/>pattern of tones and semitones are treated as basically equivalent,<br/>regardless of key centre. The little-examined assumption behind this<br/>is the consistency of equal temperament (and behind that, the broader<br/>collection of regular &apos;mean-tone&apos; layouts with their easily<br/>predictable equivalences and transposition patterns).</p><p>As Bach&apos;s temperament (along with some others) makes clear, melodic<br/>motion from Cb&#x19;/ to D is not equivalent to motion from D to Eb&#x19;-, even<br/>though in both cases we are dealing with correctly spelled diatonic<br/>semitones, and even if we shifted the frequencies of everything so the<br/>starting pitches were identical. Those semitones are perceptibly<br/>different sizes, and that fact is a musically expressive resource. For<br/>example, transpose the Sarabandes of the suites BWV823 and 819 to<br/>various different keys; the music loses much of its poignancy and in<br/>compensation it gains other characters altogether, depending on what<br/>key is chosen.</p><p>Such things can also be heard directly, with a chord in isolation as a<br/>representative exercise. CD FB and Eb&#x19;-FAb&#x19;-D do not sound at all<br/>alike in Bach&apos;s temperament; the former is gentle and the latter is<br/>piquant. EFb&#x19;/ADb&#x19;/ is brisk and crisp, while Fb&#x19;/Gb&#x19;/BEb&#x19;/ seems both<br/>delicate and clean. Other listeners will come up with different words<br/>here, akin to the descriptions of competing wines, but thepoint is<br/>that all these equivalently spaced chordssound radically different<br/>from one another. [End Page 220] Absolute placement within the complex<br/>set of 12 notes matters, absolutely!

But Lehman felt the temperament that the Germans were<br/>proposing didn&apos;t make sense; some of its premises were clearly incorrect.</p><p>&quot;Then it hit me: Bach&apos;s diagram does describe his temperament and<br/>merely needed to be interpreted correctly,&quot; Lehman said. &quot;Bach wrote<br/>down the math of his tuning method here in a simple way, not by a<br/>chart of numbers, but by drawing a picture of it. This picture tells<br/>us exactly how the tuning should be set up, unequally, so the music in<br/>that book and his other books sounds best.&quot;<br/>....<br/> Bach turned his book upside-down to draw the diagram so that when<br/>viewed right side up, it appeared in reverse. &quot;The different types of<br/>shapes in Bach&apos;s drawing tell the tuner how to make the specific notes<br/>almost in tune together, but slightly out of tune by a little amount,<br/>on purpose. This drawing is Bach&apos;s recipe to set up all 12 of the<br/>notes exactly right.

It seems<br/>to me almost exclusively entertainment (and mostly self-entertainment<br/>at that). To do &apos;reasoning&apos; you need a basis of objective<br/>propositions, whereas the whole point of tiny adjustments of musical<br/>tuning is aesthetic and depends almost totally on one&apos;s individual<br/>listening and playing experiences.</p><p>&gt; p.s. It would also help to have read Easley Blackwood&apos;s book more than<br/>&gt; 20 years ago, as I did, since it deeply informed the way I understand<br/>&gt; the construction of diatonic scales: the generation of all the notes<br/>&gt; by a series of (usually regular) 5ths.</p><p>It would help to have read also Printz, Werckmeister, Schlick,<br/>Sauveur, Rameau, CPE Bach, and a small truckload of other people in<br/>the original, as I have (Lindley much more so), if one is ever serious<br/>about getting the history. Most of them seemed to understand OK, with<br/>or without Blackwood&apos;s help. Anyway a few months on this list were<br/>enough for me to more than get the hang of the idea of constructing a<br/>scale from combining two or more distinct intervals.</p><p>&gt; Harpsichord tuning by 5ths and<br/>&gt; 4ths is done not only because it&apos;s easy and it works, but more<br/>&gt; basically because that&apos;s where we get a series of 7 and then 12<br/>&gt; inter-related notes, and beyond.</p><p>If you tune by successive minor thirds you can also get a series of<br/>19, by major thirds a series of 31, it all depends how picky you are<br/>about &apos;going beyond&apos;... but this row-of-fifths is kindergarten stuff,<br/>or beginners level in history of European music, a medieval proceeding<br/>that doesn&apos;t lead to any one specific tuning and certainly not to<br/>anything clearly connected with one Bach, except for - Bach using a<br/>cycle of fifths! That&apos;s one clear, though not terribly helpful, fact.<br/>I am also open to the possibility that harpsichords should be tuned<br/>initially by thirds anyway (a la Sorge/Norwegian Parrot)...</p><p>&gt; And, the notes of the C major scale<br/>&gt; are central to that section of the spiral used most.</p><p>What is &apos;used most&apos; by who and when is a very slippery concept. It<br/>might lead one to think that different periods or styles require<br/>different tunings!</p><p>Don&apos;t worry, I probably will get round to dealing with more recent<br/>messages ... ain&apos;t seen nothin&apos; yet, as someone once said.<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2008 7:13:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Pre-judgment as to what to read is - unfortunately - an absolute<br/>&gt; necessity in science.

Debate is still ongoing concerning which<br/>scale Bach&apos;s Well Tempered Clavier was designed for.

The Well Temperaments of this period<br/>differ profoundly from Meantone or Equal. Not only do they allow full<br/>modulation, they create a predictable variety of consonance and<br/>dissonance, providing an acoustical palette of tonal &quot;colors&quot; for the<br/>composer&apos;s use.</p><p>Keyboard compositions written during this period appear to make use of<br/>harmonic values which do not exist in the other temperaments. The<br/>evolving art of modulation, the development of sonata form with its<br/>harmonic rules, and the known emotional-affective nature of tempering<br/>variety, all indicate the use of a commonly accepted form of well<br/>tempered keyboards.</p><p>Not only do the Well Temperaments provide tonal contrast, they also<br/>offer a higher degree of consonance than is available in Equal<br/>Temperament. They can, when called upon, be far more &quot;in tune&quot; than<br/>today&apos;s norm. (By the same technique, if the composer desires, they<br/>can produce sounds as dreary and tense as a funeral dirge, it all<br/>depends on the choice of key).</p><p>Temperament thus forms the keyboard&apos;s intonation, and that it has<br/>changed so profoundly has strong implications for musicians and<br/>audiences who seek the fullest expression of a composer&apos;s work.<br/>Substitution of a different intonation will necessarily change any<br/>composer&apos;s harmonic organization, and it is reasonable to expect music<br/>performed in non-original temperament to lose something of the<br/>composers intention.&quot;</p><p>Despite to modern broade laymanish claims,<br/>there&apos;s no historical evidence that JSB ever considered<br/>the 5th Bb-F as an alleged &quot;dimished-6th&quot; of ~704 Cents.<br/>That bias in the reverse direction<br/>results in an additional artificial resistance<br/>against modulations over that ~2Cents to much wide wrong 5th.</p><p>A.

The<br/>tuning allowed the use of a wider range of keys than would have been<br/>available in meantone temperament. This fact may have encouraged the<br/>young Bach to experiment with bold modulations and excursions into<br/>keys that would have seemed quite shocking to the conservative<br/>parishioners. These experiments may well have led to the criticism of<br/>Bach that was mentioned above. &quot;<br/>...<br/>&quot;The original pitch of the organ was restored and set at 465 Hz at 18<br/>degrees Celsius.

I have already mentioned the fact that the temperament<br/>allowed Bach to play in keys with more sharps and flats. C.P.E.

Bach clearly called his<br/>book well-tempered, not equal-tempered. The search as to which<br/>&acirc;unequal&acirc;&#x9D; system Bach had in mind was something of a holy grail (...)&quot;</p><p>First, this hides an unspoken assumption that Bach would care whether<br/>any keyboard tuning was actually equal-tempered with any precision<br/>(which is a theoretical and mathematical question) - or just<br/>*sufficiently* equal. That Bach really cared at all about keeping the<br/>theorists happy. Perhaps he didn&apos;t give a damn about the theoretical<br/>status of a tuning in divisions of the comma, or about precisely which<br/>key sounded slightly better or worse than another, as long as they all<br/>sounded good enough.<br/>To such a practical musician, the question &apos;But do you mean exactly<br/>equal-tempered or not&apos; is absolutely meaningless. Near-equal tunings<br/>would be just as much &apos;well-tempered&apos; as equal temperament itself.</p><p>Or if you want to argue with even more historical backing, the phrase<br/>&apos;well-tempered&apos; is almost a straight quotation from Werckmeister, -<br/>who certainly said that ET was a good tuning for the purpose of<br/>playing in all keys.<br/>So, from the only writer(s) before Bach&apos;s era who gave a meaningful<br/>definition of a &apos;good temperament&apos;, equal temperament WAS one.</p><p>Historically, the great difference was not between equal and<br/>nearly-equal, it was the much greater one between nearly-equal and<br/>meantone. But Egarr ignores this and would like to have us believe<br/>that Bach necessarily cared to differentiate between ET and all other<br/>&apos;good temperaments&apos;. Assumes that Bach must have shared a 20th-century<br/>(and probably Egarr&apos;s own) neurotic and pedantic obsession over tiny<br/>differences in tuning between equal and not-quite-equal.</p><p>Second, the unspoken assumption that Bach had exactly _one_ &apos;unequal<br/>system&apos; in mind - which then necessarily assumes the status of a &apos;holy<br/>grail&apos;.<br/>There is no evidence or reason at all for this assumption (which one<br/>might call a late 20th century obsession), and plenty against it, such<br/>as that Bach had dozens of pupils, but not one of them said anything<br/>about a specific &apos;unequal system&apos;, let alone tried to describe it. We<br/>have &apos;take away a small amount of the absolute purity from most of the<br/>fifths and check all the chords&apos; and &apos;all the thirds sharp&apos; - and<br/>that&apos;s all folks!</p><p>Carried along with this is the assumption that anyone in the Bach<br/>household would bother or need to record any aspect of tuning with<br/>enough exactness to reproduce it from one day to the next. To make it<br/>a &apos;system&apos;. It&apos;s the Holy Grail again, assuming there is a single<br/>formula to be preserved forever for the enlightenment of the heathen,<br/>rather than a general skill in listening which allows you or anyone<br/>else to make a freshly &apos;good tuning&apos; every day. If you don&apos;t need to<br/>record your tuning from yesterday or last year, if you are happy to<br/>let it be yesterday&apos;s, there is no point in writing down even a single<br/>figure or symbol.</p><p>So the ideas that Bach 1) would necessarily care whether a keyboard<br/>was equally tempered or not, and 2) needed a particular mathematical<br/>or mechanical recipe aka &apos;system&apos; to make a &apos;good tuning&apos;, and 3)<br/>necessarily considered exactly one non-equal tuning as &apos;good&apos; or<br/>&apos;well&apos; tempered - are all absolutely groundless from a historical<br/>perspective. And if they arise as unspoken assumptions in a line of<br/>argument, absolutely misleading.</p><p>Is it intentionally misleading? One would hope not. Is it written with<br/>an intent to persuade above all else, and a clear unwillingness to<br/>think historically, to examine a wide range of evidence and to analyze<br/>and question his own assumptions? Yes. It is salesmanship, it has<br/>nothing at all to do with history, because Egarr uses legalistic<br/>verbal tricks and leading phraseology. He doesn&apos;t think like an early<br/>18th-century Capellmeister and harpsichordist (question: how does this<br/>chord sound and how should I adjust the notes around it) but rather a<br/>20th-century academic Early Music Expert (question: which one<br/>mathematical division of the comma a.k.a. &apos;system&apos; is most Authentic<br/>for Bach).</p><p>I have no idea how much Egarr actually knows about history. But how<br/>misleading is it for Brad to knowingly endorse the anti-historical<br/>argument &apos;Bach said well-tempered so he can&apos;t possibly have meant<br/>equal-tempered&apos;?</p><p>How misleading is it to knowingly spread the idea &apos;Bach had just one<br/>unequal &quot;good temperament&quot;, which could be mathematically formulated&apos;<br/>as an unspoken assumption?</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2008 12:57:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andreas Sparschuh&quot; &lt;a_sparschuh@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Nevertheless some<br/>&gt; &gt; modern commercial tunings alike &apos;Kellner&apos; or &apos;Lehman&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; still persist in wrongly labeled the as &quot;original&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; in order to mislead astray the deceived customers by fraud.<br/>&gt;<br/>B.L. replied:<br/>&gt; Andreas, my work is not &quot;fraud&quot;,<br/>&gt; or any attempt to deceive or mislead<br/>&gt; anyone.</p><p>What about with the kidded editor of Early-Music,<br/>that you made belive in yours alleged &quot;discovery&quot; claims?</p><p><a href="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/1/1.pdf">http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/1/1.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/early_music/v033/33.1knighton.html">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/early_music/v033/33.1knighton.html</a><br/>&quot;   &#x9;<br/>Editorial:<br/>4, November 2004</p><p>Over the last 30 years a number of exciting discoveries have appeared<br/>in the pages of Early music: many of these have helped to shape<br/>thinking on questions of performance practice, and have thus been<br/>influential on the way we perform and hear early music today. So I am<br/>very happy to present a further discovery, made last year by<br/>harpsichordist and scholar Bradley Lehman, whose fascinating article<br/>clearly establishes the temperament Bach had in mind when he composed<br/>Das wohltemperirte Clavier, and, very probably, much of the rest of<br/>his uvre.<br/>Lehman has risen to the challenge offered by Malcolm Boyd in his<br/>discussion of performance practice in Bach&apos;s music. &apos;The quest&apos;, wrote<br/>Boyd in his biography of Bach, &apos;continues, not for the complete<br/>&quot;authenticity&quot; in performance which is unattainable and probably<br/>undesirable, but to establish what conditions are indispensable for<br/>any performance that hopes to capture the true essence of Bach&apos;s art.<br/>Possibly the most revealing discoveries still to be made await a more<br/>thorough application than has so far been attempted of the<br/>temperaments (tunings) in use during Bach&apos;s time.&apos; I will leave Lehman<br/>to describe and substantiate the evidence for the temperament he has<br/>discoveredor more accurately, perhaps, uncovered, for the story<br/>begins with a brilliant piece of detective work or, again more<br/>accurately, decodingin this and the next issue. Based on a unique<br/>blend of three different &apos;equal&apos; scales, the temperament works equally<br/>well in any key, or genre. This discovery should indeed afford further<br/>insight into the &apos;true essence&apos; of Bach&apos;s art. &quot;</p><p>&gt; I am honest and sincere.<br/>Agreed.</p><p>&gt; I have presented my research...<br/>...without proper reference to earlier work on the squiggles,<br/>when claiming it as yours own alleged &quot;discovery&quot;,<br/>except a cryptic hidden remark in &quot;supplementary&quot; file:<br/><a href="http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/data/33/1/3/DC1/2">http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/data/33/1/3/DC1/2</a><br/>there on p.45 out of 46pages,<br/>appears an distorted reference to:<br/><a href="http://keithbriggs.info/bach-wtc.html">http://keithbriggs.info/bach-wtc.html</a><br/>of May 31, 2003</p><p>&gt; and my<br/>&gt; reasoning, clearly.<br/>by<br/><a href="http://www.larips.com/">http://www.larips.com/</a><br/>&quot;In a favorite term from my wife&apos;s field, this caused a &quot;cognitive<br/>dissonance&quot; in my mind as I studied Bach&apos;s drawing.

The title of this<br/>work alone continues to raise discussion and sets temperatures at a<br/>high level in musicological circles, as it throws up two very specific<br/>questions: what is the meaning of &grave;Wohltemperirte&apos; and which &grave;Clavier&apos;<br/>should we use for this music. Quite honestly I see little problem<br/>myself. The concept and tuning of an &grave;equal&apos; tempered system were<br/>fully understood and known well before Bach&apos;s time. Bach clearly<br/>called his book &grave;well&apos;-tempered, not &grave;equal&apos;-tempered. It is amazing<br/>to me that hugely respected musical reference publications can in 2007<br/>still describe this collection in the following way: &quot;Presumably Bach<br/>brought [the Preludes and Fugues] together for convenience, partly to<br/>serve as the last step in his keyboard course, partly to exhibit the<br/>advantages of equal temperament.&quot; The search as to which &grave;unequal&apos;<br/>system Bach had in mind was something of a &grave;holy grail&apos; until Bradley<br/>Lehman &grave;decoded&apos; the &grave;decoration&apos; that adorns the title page. His<br/>conclusions have now been thrown around the Internet and hugely<br/>debated, resulting in the seemingly inevitable opposing camps of<br/>believers and non-believers. I am a believer. The tuning system&apos;s<br/>simplicity and brilliance lends an amazing yet perfectly balanced set<br/>of colours to each of the keys within the cycle  the world&apos;s first<br/>musical cycle to climb steadily through all the keys, major and minor.<br/>...<br/>&quot;<br/>so far about R.Egarr&apos;s statements as selfproclaimed musicologist.</p><p>Don Satz critizies Egarr&apos;s performance on the harpsichord:</p><p><a href="http://www.classical.net/music/recs/reviews/h/hmu07425a.php">http://www.classical.net/music/recs/reviews/h/hmu07425a.php</a><br/><a href="http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2006/Jun06/Bach_Goldberg_HMU90742526.htm">http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2006/Jun06/Bach_Goldberg_HMU90742526.htm</a></p><p>&quot;In Egarr&apos;s quest to find cantabile heaven, he uses two unique<br/>features. First, he employs a tuning system that has recently been<br/>advanced as the one Bach may have used for his own keyboard works.<br/>This system was researched and developed by the musicologist and early<br/>keyboard artist Bradley Lehman. Without going into the details of the<br/>research, Lehman has taken a 17th century sixth comma meantone tuning<br/>and adjusted it to accommodate the most remote key areas. In doing so,<br/>Lehman is confident that he has developed a tuning regimen that<br/>highlights the musicality and attractiveness of the harpsichord. Egarr<br/>is of like mind, and uses Lehman&apos;s tuning system to assist in reaching<br/>cantabile heaven.....<br/>.....His articulation is generally on the weak side, and it has been<br/>quite a few years since I&apos;ve heard a version of the Goldberg<br/>Variations with so little determination; pointed phrasing simply gets<br/>little attention from Egarr, and the quills do not help the matter.<br/>Perhaps most important, Egarr conveys little of the excitement, drive,<br/>and momentum of the faster variations that comes from the best<br/>harpsichord versions including those of Kenneth Gilbert on Harmonia<br/>Mundi, Gustav Leonhardt on Teldec, and Pierre Hantai on Mirare. Egarr<br/>takes the fast variations at a pace much slower than the norm, robbing<br/>them of their inherent exuberance and propulsive elements and<br/>substituting an unappealing restraint and sluggishness. Another<br/>problematic aspect is that Egarr is not interested in representing the<br/>underbelly of the human condition as Variations 9, 13, 15, and 25 (The<br/>Black Pearl) are not sufficiently characterized.</p><p>Disappointment also comes to center stage with Egarr&apos;s performance of<br/>Variation 30. In this variation, a singing tone is an absolute<br/>necessity; yet, Egarr abandons his own stated cantabile goals and<br/>offers us quite a choppy presentation. &quot;</p><p>Finally Don Satz concludes:<br/>&quot;<br/>....But those looking for a broader set of qualities might be<br/>disappointed. Personally, I find the interpretations rather<br/>soft-grained with a very low excitement/drive quotient.....<br/>....If it seems that I have been straddling the fence a little, allow<br/>me to correct the situation by stating clearly that Egarr&apos;s Goldberg<br/>Variations is not one of the great recorded performances of the work.&quot;</p><p>Or less &quot;straddling&quot; reviewed by<br/>Lyne Heffly in:<br/><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/06/entertainment/et-weekarts6">http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/06/entertainment/et-weekarts6</a><br/>&quot; Egarr, an internationally known keyboard virtuoso and conductor and<br/>the director of Amsterdam&apos;s Academy of the Begijnhof, plays the<br/>&quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; using a tuning only recently published by<br/>harpsichord scholar Bradley Lehman.</p><p>Lehman decoded a &quot;squiggle&quot; on the title page of Bach&apos;s &quot;The<br/>Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; that he believes described the composer&apos;s<br/>tuning system, Egarr explained in a phone interview.</p><p>&quot;Other people have been trying to find Bach&apos;s tuning,&quot; Egarr says.<br/>&quot;It&apos;s a bit of a Holy Grail in a way.&quot; Although not universally<br/>accepted, Lehman&apos;s discovery is &quot;quite a convincing and most brilliant<br/>piece of detective work. It really sounds fantastic in Bach&apos;s keyboard<br/>music  and that seems to me proof, if anything. It really does work<br/>with the music.&quot;&quot;</p><p>Tom asked:<br/>&gt; But how<br/>&gt; misleading is it for Brad to knowingly endorse the anti-historical<br/>&gt; argument &apos;Bach said well-tempered so he can&apos;t possibly have meant<br/>&gt; equal-tempered&apos;?</p><p>here an example of such an misleaden view:<br/><a href="http://www.guyguitars.com/eng/handbook/Tuning/temperament.html">http://www.guyguitars.com/eng/handbook/Tuning/temperament.html</a><br/> &quot;Unfortunately neither Bach nor his sons ever saw fit to write down<br/>explicit instructions on how to tune this temperament, and it has thus<br/>sadly been lost to us for almost 250 years. However, according to Dr.<br/>Bradley Lehman, A.Mus.D. (harpsichord), of Goshen College, Indiana,<br/>the key to the mystery has been hidden in plain sight since 1722 - in<br/>Bach&apos;s own hand, on the title page of the original manuscript of &quot;Das<br/>Wohltemperirte Clavier&quot;. Dr. Lehman&apos;s intimate knowledge of Bach&apos;s<br/>music, and extensive hands-on experience of harpsichord tuning,<br/>enabled him to crack the code at last.</p><p>His breakthrough came in April 2004 and is making huge waves<br/>internationally in the world of the harpsichord and the pipe organ....<br/>&quot;</p><p>Quest: (how to convince Brad? about his):<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Ado_About_Nothing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Ado_About_Nothing</a><br/>else than an perhaps merely decorative ornament?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How misleading is it to knowingly spread the idea<br/>&gt;&apos;Bach had just one<br/>&gt; unequal &quot;good temperament&quot;, which could be mathematically<br/>&gt; formulated&apos;<br/>&gt; as an unspoken assumption?</p><p>I.m.h.o:<br/><a href="http://dict.leo.org/forum/viewWrongentry.php?idThread=45577&idForum=3&lp=ende&lang=de">http://dict.leo.org/forum/viewWrongentry.php?idThread=45577&idForum=3&lp=ende&lang=de</a><br/>&quot;Don&apos;t believe the guff in those tabloids.&quot;</p><p>bye<br/>A.S.</p></div><h3>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/21/2008 12:57:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote despaired:</p><p>&gt; Now if Brad succeeds, every Bach-tuning will be a<br/>&gt; clone of the next...</p><p>Already Roland Hutchinson feared that evil prognosis in:<br/><a href="https://lists.wu-wien.ac.at/pipermail/earlym-l/2005-February/000887.html">https://lists.wu-wien.ac.at/pipermail/earlym-l/2005-February/000887.html</a></p><p>&quot;4.
