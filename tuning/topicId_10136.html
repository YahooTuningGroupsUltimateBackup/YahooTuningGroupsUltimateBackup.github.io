There are some<br/>very curious statements which I&apos;m not repeating but he makes a few<br/>important observations.</p><p>More curious is the tenacity with which the bagpipe has clung to its<br/>distinctly Arabian scale with whole tones and three-quarter tones in the<br/>midst of a world of diatonic scales.  Wherever the old Oriental<br/>instrument appears on its journey to Scotland--in the Mediterranean,<br/>Spain, or Brittany--the foreign scale is preserved; and it is quite an<br/>experience to watch the guards march into Buckingham Palace, the band<br/>playing &quot;correctly&quot; and the bagpipes &quot;in Arabic.&quot;<br/> Oriental influence in the Middle Ages was evidently not limited to the<br/>instruments, and not even to their particular scales, no instrument<br/>travels without its music. . . .

Pratt, The Liberal Arts Press, New<br/>York, 1957, pp25-6]</p><p> . . . Our notes deceive us: performance style, which they cannot<br/>express, counts for more than the bald arrangement of steps that they<br/>set forth.  How dare we suppose that the Christian Spaniards and<br/>Proven&iuml;&iquest;&half;als sheared the Moorish melodies of all their characteristic<br/>traits!  Incidentally, one picture, and a very late one, provides a<br/>strange confirmation: in the famous altarpiece of Ghent (c. 1425, that<br/>is, in the time of Dufay), van Eyck painted the singing angels grouped<br/>around St. Cecilia with, above the nose, the quite un-European but<br/>typically Oriental creases which result from nasal singing and which we<br/>find so often five thousand years ago in the portraits of Egyptian<br/>singers and in the living Orient of today.  (Commerical photos of the<br/>altar seldom show this detail.)  [Sachs, Curt &quot;The Lore of Non-Western<br/>Music&quot; in Some Aspects of Musicology,&quot; Three Essays by . . . Arthur<br/>Mendel, Curt Sachs, and Carroll C. Pratt, The Liberal Arts Press, New<br/>York, 1957, p26]</p><p> Feeling the impact of Oriental music, a few persons began to realize<br/>that Western music was not unlimited.  It dawned upon some<br/>musicologists, perhaps for the first time, that our great achievements<br/>in harmony, polyphony, and orchestration had involved sacrifices in<br/>other fields; that Europe had compressed into the conventional major and<br/>minor the incredible richness of melodic types and modes that still<br/>flourished in the East; that the West&apos;s even, unalterable semitones,<br/>forced into a uniform &quot;equal temperament,&quot; had supplanted a wealth of<br/>variable tunings.  Under the strait jacket of harmonic motion our melody<br/>had become a poor device connecting related chords, while Western<br/>rhythm, its counterpart infinitely subtle in the East, had degenerated<br/>into a system that did little more than mark binary or tenary accent<br/>groups.  [Sachs, Curt &quot;The Lore of Non-Western Music&quot; in Some Aspects of<br/>Musicology,&quot; Three Essays by . . . Arthur Mendel, Curt Sachs, and<br/>Carroll C. Pratt, The Liberal Arts Press, New York, 1957, p30]</p><p> The epoch-making publication of this method took place in Ellis&apos;<br/>&quot;Tonometrical Observations on some Existing Non-Harmonic Scales,&quot; a<br/>paper first printed in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (1884) and<br/>reprinted in the following year in the Journal of the Society of Arts<br/>under the simplified title &quot;On the Musical Scales of Various Nations.&quot;<br/>In his own words, &quot;The final conclusion is that the Musical Scales is<br/>not one, not &apos;natural,&apos; nor even founded necessarily on the laws of the<br/>constitution of musical sound so beautifully worked out by Helmholtz,<br/>but very diverse, very artificial, and very capricious.&quot;  [p43]</p></div>
