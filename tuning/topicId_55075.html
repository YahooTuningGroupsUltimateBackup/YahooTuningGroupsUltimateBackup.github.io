It does not need to be a regular<br/>temperament tuning, though the examples I give are.</p><p>For example, in the 5-limit for twelve note scales we have 12-et<br/>commas 81/80, 128/125, and 2048/2025, and we want to deal with these<br/>in a way which helps to produce a circulating temperament. One thing<br/>we might do is to shrink the size of 81/80 and 2048/2025, so that<br/>intervals off by these are closer to just. If we at the same time<br/>decide to make them equal in size, we want to temper out<br/>(81/80)/(2048/2025) = 32805/32768; hence, if we want this we need a<br/>schismic temperament tuning. This gives us one constraint<br/>on the tuning for 3 and 5, to get another, we might insist that 32/25,<br/>which is 5/4 sharp by 128/125, come out to exactly 14/11. This gives<br/>us a tuning of schismic (in fact of the 11-limit temperament tempering<br/>out the schisma and 176/175) which works as a well tuning; the<br/>values of which are</p><p>[1200, 1901.094, 2791.246]</p><p>which is pretty close to 89-equal.</p><p>More exotic plans are possible; for instance if we determine that<br/>192/125 should come out as 20/13 and 162/125 as 13/10 we get a tuning<br/>of the 13-limit temperament (or {2,3,5,13}-temperament) tempering out<br/>325/324 and 625/624. Adding the schisma gives 53-et, but<br/>the tuning described above with the exact exotic fifths and thirds is</p><p>[1200, 1902.809, 2785.674]</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2004 3:27:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; By a well tuning I mean a regular tuning (a tuning of the primes in<br/>&gt; some p-limit) which can be applied to p-limit JI scales in order to<br/>&gt; produce a circulating temperament.
