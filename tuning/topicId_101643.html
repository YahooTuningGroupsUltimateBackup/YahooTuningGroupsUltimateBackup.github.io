I&apos;ve gotten the<br/>best reaction so far from &quot;regular temperament theory.&quot; The reaction I<br/>usually get is something like &quot;temperament? I know what that is. A<br/>theory of temperaments, sounds logical. What&apos;s a &apos;regular&apos;<br/>temperament? Sounds vaguely interesting, although I hate math.&quot;</p><p>Say that you&apos;ve spent a lot of time immersed in &quot;regular temperament<br/>theory,&quot; or if you&apos;re my age play the role of the unabashed &quot;regular<br/>temperament theory&quot; nerd, and make it sound important, and the other<br/>theory nerds will love you! Just so long as they&apos;ve not had to learn<br/>music set theory yet, at which point they&apos;ll build up a wall to<br/>protect themselves from any more math, and hence look down on your<br/>theory as a defense mechanism. In general:</p><p>- The best reaction by far has been just &quot;regular temperament theory,&quot;<br/>which is short, to the point, brief, is three words with &quot;theory&quot; on<br/>the end just like &quot;music set theory,&quot; communicates that it&apos;s a theory<br/>that revolves around a specific thing which must be important for some<br/>reason, and uses words that people know. It sounds organized and<br/>logical. In comparison, a phrase like &quot;music set theory&quot; sounds puny<br/>and weak and as though it would lose in a fight, much like Batman<br/>would lose in a fight to Superman.</p><p>- &quot;The regular mapping paradigm&quot; works if you sell it as though it&apos;s<br/>some kind of transcendental state that you&apos;ve achieved with the help<br/>of science. The problem is that people often don&apos;t intuitively realize<br/>that I&apos;m talking about a concrete theory for music; it just sounds<br/>more like I&apos;m talking about &quot;the serialist perspective on music&quot; or<br/>something like that. Saying things like &quot;regular temperament theory<br/>evolved out of the modern regular mapping paradigm&quot; seem to go over<br/>well.</p><p>- The name &quot;microtonal theory&quot; has usually gotten a bad reaction.<br/>People tend to treat the word &quot;microtonal&quot; the same way that they<br/>treat the word &quot;atonal&quot;, like it&apos;s some kind of hyper-specialized<br/>passing academic fad genre that uses small notes.</p><p>- Do not ever use the word &quot;xenharmonic&quot; in a serious sentence when<br/>describing the theory behind music in new tuning systems. If you ever<br/>use this word in front of a person who had a strongly negative first<br/>experience with microtonal music, it will just reinforce the idea they<br/>have that you are oblivious to things that sound dumb. Maybe it just<br/>doesn&apos;t match my South Philly accent too well.</p><p>- The name &quot;tuning theory&quot; comes across like it&apos;s something that<br/>people who tune Steinways for a living would learn. People can&apos;t<br/>believe I&apos;d spend so much time studying how to tune guitars. I&apos;ve<br/>never gotten a good reaction from this name.</p><p>- People tend to like &quot;alternative tunings&quot; a lot, particularly drop D<br/>and DADGAD.</p><p>- &quot;Intonation theory&quot; sounds like it&apos;d go well with &quot;articulation<br/>theory&quot; and &quot;phrasing theory&quot; and &quot;the regular ornamentation<br/>paradigm.&quot; Use this if you want people to think you spend hours on an<br/>online mailing list figuring out how to get horn players to tune<br/>12-equal better in a way that most can&apos;t hear.</p><p>I was thinking about trying the name &quot;music group theory&quot; at one<br/>point, but I doubt my music theory Ph. D buddies will be convinced.<br/>Plus, I think what we&apos;re doing is &quot;music theory,&quot; no subfield<br/>required, of which &quot;regular temperament theory&quot; is just the first<br/>thing you should learn to be up to date on modern music theory.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101647 href="#101647">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2011 8:23:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; - People tend to like &quot;alternative tunings&quot; a lot, particularly drop D<br/>&gt; and DADGAD.</p><p> Remember that time some guy came on the list asking about tuning his motorcycle or something, so we gave him all this nonsense advice that mostly consisted of terrible puns?</p><p>Good times.</p><p>Keenan</p></div>
