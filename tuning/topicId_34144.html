Whoa! It&apos;s hard to believe we&apos;re talking about the same<br/>thing.<br/>&gt; (Do we have to go back there? Clearly I wasn&apos;t convinced then. On the<br/>other<br/>&gt; hand, that might be a good place to start our &apos;experiments.&apos;)</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The diminished fifth<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; sucks like a vacuum toward a major or minor third resolution and an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; augmented fourth pushes like an explosion toward a major or minor<br/>&gt; &gt; sixth.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i agree that this is a defining feature of tonal music as it<br/>&gt; &gt; developed in the western world. i disagree that the augmented fourth<br/>&gt; &gt; has to be larger than the diminished fifth for it to work. that<br/>&gt; &gt; tendency is only about half as old as tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. And what a discovery. While the clerics of the middle ages forbade<br/>the<br/>&gt; tritone, and the devil-may-care Renaissance composers bent the rules, it<br/>was<br/>&gt; the early Baroque that discovered the full value of the &quot;tritone.&quot; Some of<br/>&gt; those slow introductions to their concertos were mind blowing. No wonder<br/>the<br/>&gt; harpsichordist tried to add extra digitals on his &apos;axe.&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps it became<br/>&gt; &gt; important once (a) the system was fully &apos;closed&apos; at 12 pitches; and<br/>&gt; &gt; (b) modulations were so common and so great in span (on the chain of<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths) that a given tritone could easily resolve to two different<br/>&gt; &gt; tonal centers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s my point, dear heart. It&apos;s the ambiguous *keyboard* &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>&gt; that prompted its &quot;three whole steps&quot; nickname.</p><p>no it&apos;s not, Gerry.</p><p>we&apos;ve been thru this before, and my responses then were addressed<br/>directly to you.</p><p>the &quot;tritone&quot; is so named because in  P y t h a g o r e a n<br/>tuning and theory it&apos;s 3 &quot;tones&quot;, (9/8)^3 = 729/512 =<br/>~611.7300052 cents = &quot;augmented 4th&quot;.</p><p>the &quot;diminished 5th&quot; in Pythagorean tuning is a different<br/>ratio from this, and is clearly audible as such.</p><p>now of course i must acknowledge that the word &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>is used generically to mean *both* the &quot;augmented 4th&quot;<br/>*and* the &quot;diminished 5th&quot; -- and  T H I S  is probably<br/>more likely the result of keyboard-based thinking.</p><p>but the original name &quot;tritone&quot; has a clear basis in<br/>Pythagorean tuning.  see my Dictionary entry, which<br/>gives measurements for more different kinds of &quot;tritones&quot;<br/>than anyone will probably ever care about:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tritone.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tritone.htm</a></p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 1:31:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/12/02 10:13 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 15<br/>&gt;  Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2002 19:36:38 -0800<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;monz&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:joemonz@yahoo.com">joemonz@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: tritone (was: Digest Number 1891)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Me:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s the ambiguous *keyboard* &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>&gt; that prompted its &quot;three whole steps&quot; nickname.<br/>&gt;<br/>Monz:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; no it&apos;s not, Gerry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; we&apos;ve been thru this before, and my responses then were addressed<br/>&gt; directly to you.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean the info stuck, Monz.

This agrees with my point that they are different from &quot;keyboard&quot;<br/>tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now of course i must acknowledge that the word &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>&gt; is used generically to mean *both* the &quot;augmented 4th&quot;<br/>&gt; *and* the &quot;diminished 5th&quot; -- and  T H I S  is probably<br/>&gt; more likely the result of keyboard-based thinking.</p><p>You got it! *That&apos;s* the one I was talking about. The term is handy when<br/>referring to either (or both) &quot;inversions&quot; as they function (usually as<br/>dominant in common practice) in musical contexts .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but the original name &quot;tritone&quot; has a clear basis in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning.  see my Dictionary entry, which<br/>&gt; gives measurements for more different kinds of &quot;tritones&quot;<br/>&gt; than anyone will probably ever care about:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tritone.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tritone.htm</a></p><p>Always good to know derivations.
