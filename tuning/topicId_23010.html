I changed it to make<br/>the triads visible, but that made a hash of things.</p><p>3) Re : MIDI</p><p>I believe the improvement was called ZIPI, which (like the<br/>midi tuning specification) suffered a quiet death when<br/>faced with the music instrument manufacturers. Computer<br/>Music Journal had pretty good articles about both of those<br/>which gave me hope for a &apos;next big thing&apos; a &apos;long time<br/>ago&apos;.</p><p>Yamaha also has a spec for an improved midi, it may be<br/>an extension to xg which not only adds chanels etc but<br/>since it is designed for 1394 firewire (IIRC), is fast<br/>enough to also embed audio (whether for sample transfer<br/>or actual playback I can&apos;t remember).</p><p>MIDI was slow even when it came out. They never would<br/>have accepted a cost adder of more than $1 for<br/>everything including UART, connecters, etc... This<br/>is part of why the next standard will be based on<br/>firewire or usb or one other of the hi-speed serial<br/>interconnect standards being touted for the past few<br/>years. It has to cost NOTHIN&apos; for the manufacturers to<br/>add it.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
