However,<br/>when I&apos;ve talked with massage therapists and others in the healing<br/>professions, they have shown a lot of interest in the idea of tunings and<br/>frequencies as potentially beneficial to our minds and bodies.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Can anyone explain how one&apos;s physical body and mind are actually<br/>physically<br/>&gt;&gt; affected by pure tuning?  Has anyone measured the effects scientifically<br/>&gt;&gt; and documented the findings? How would one measure something like this?</p><p>&gt; Maybe you should do this research!<br/>-- Kraig Grady</p><p>I&apos;d rather not do it myself, but if anyone&apos;s done any work in this<br/>particular field or knows of any, I&apos;d love to hear about it. (Pat - I&apos;ve<br/>started reading about the Lambdoma matrix - thank you)</p><p>As far as music and intelligence go, it seems that anything which engages<br/>your mind will affect your intelligence, and with music, that will be<br/>different for everybody.  Perhaps something like baroque music might have a<br/>measurable effect on a group of people because baroque music appeals to the<br/>minds of a lot of people.   A lot of the music discussed on this forum<br/>might appeal to the minds of a smaller number of people, but can be just as<br/>engaging.  I imagine it would be terribly time consuming to measure this<br/>scientifically.</p><p>Jimmy Lewis wrote  &quot;I have learned a lot about tunings and scales from this<br/>list, but have often wondered how such knowledge leads to the goal (a<br/>primitive one) of music, which is to promote synergy.&quot;  I&apos;ve wondered about<br/>that too.  I&apos;ve heard it said that the term &quot;in concert&quot; refers to the<br/>&quot;secret current&quot; that runs to and from audience and performer, that you do<br/>not attend a concert, but are in concert.  &quot;Interestingly, this information<br/>for the most part is second nature in musicians who receive their musical<br/>experience and training in their cultural setting. They know how to play<br/>the music to achieve a synergy between musician and audience.&quot; Yes. Does<br/>anyone else have thoughts on tuning in the audience&apos;s frequency in concert?</p></div><h3><a id=611 href="#611">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/1999 4:41:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brian<br/>My ensemble -The Big Swifty &amp; Associates Trendmongers did 14 concerts in 1997-8<br/>w/ just frequency combined w/digital color projections done on a Media 100 and<br/>the general response was awe and gasps when the music finished. I think dense<br/>harminies based on JI are definitely effective to audience response --as long<br/>as one does&apos;nt over-intellectualize before hand trying to explain the tuning<br/>process therby alienating the audience.</p><p>&gt;</p></div>
