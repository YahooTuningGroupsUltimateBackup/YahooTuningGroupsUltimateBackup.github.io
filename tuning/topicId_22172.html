Stephen Mayer (10 years older than I) and<br/>Robert Jurgrau (3 years younger than I) were composing solo works for bassoon<br/>for me to play...with quartertones.

The standard must stand out for comparison and for<br/>&quot;raison d&apos;&ecirc;tre.&quot;  And some on this list who do not think of themselves as<br/>microtonal might take a step back and reflect on what it means upon someone<br/>who does.</p><p>When all interval relationships are included in a &quot;microtonal&quot; concept, then<br/>there are no bandwidths of much importance.

As I&apos;ve<br/>said on this list before, my own reaction to the disagreement about the<br/>meaning of the word &quot;microtonal&quot;, or any other word, is to write<br/>separate dictionary entries in recognition that both (or several)<br/>meanings are in use.  Tui mentioned the exchange without any prompting<br/>on my part, and I thought it was striking given your posts on the<br/>subject.  She, like many others, uses the word to mean &quot;anything but<br/>12-tET&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Now if one speaks in quartertones, 12-tET is the mirror image of your<br/>&gt;&quot;microtonal&quot; world.  The standard must stand out for comparison and for<br/>&gt;&quot;raison d&apos;Âˆtre.&quot;  And some on this list who do not think of themselves<br/>&gt;as microtonal might take a step back and reflect on what it means upon<br/>&gt;someone who does.</p><p>&gt;When all interval relationships are included in a &quot;microtonal&quot; concept,<br/>&gt;then there are no bandwidths of much importance.

I can recede 12-tET in my mind (and do all the time), but it sure<br/>as heck has a grip on most Western music out there.  Something way<br/>beyond &quot;standard&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Frankly, I don&apos;t remember discussing this issue with Tui much at all.<br/>&gt;It probably was the result of my publishing an essay &quot;A Microtonal<br/>&gt;Sensibility&quot; in 1982 as part of the Ear Magazine &quot;MIcrotonal Issue,&quot;<br/>&gt;which I guest edited, along with Tui and Robert Jurgrau.
