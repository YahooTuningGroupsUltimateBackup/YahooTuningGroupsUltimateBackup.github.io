It started with a Master&apos;s thesis called<br/>Bach&apos;s Tuning.  At the time of Columbia University, it seemed likely that<br/>Werckmeister III was the most likely tuning.  25 years later, I feel it a certaintly<br/>(current wiggles excepted).</p><p>Some information has come to me from this List.  It seem quite comfortable to<br/>say the following:</p><p>Troubadors through Middle Ages, use Pythagorean tuning</p><p>Early Renaissance introduceds the pure major third into the Mediterranean.<br/>Different tunings are employed: fretted tunings, irregular tunings (John<br/>Dowland), a cappella tunigns, etc.  Pythagorean models of tuning linger on in<br/>different forms, mostly influencing the fretted tunings.</p><p>The Baroque coincides with the prominence of the keyboard.  For well<br/>temperament in Thuringia and its environs (Pachelbell, the Bachs, Krebs) Werckmeister<br/>III makes the most sense for keyboard and instrumental.  Werckmeister,<br/>himself, was the area&apos;s major promoter of mixing instruments with the organ in the<br/>church.</p><p>Telemann was into extended sixth-comma meantone, as did Frederick the Great<br/>in Potsdam.  Mozart followed suit.  The story of how sixth-comma meantone took<br/>over Europe is still to be told...but it happened.  The Dutch remained<br/>stauchly quarter-comma meantone.  England, perhaps the homeland of the just third,<br/>produced some independent tuning thinkers (Newton, Thompson, Bosanquet), came up<br/>with lots of irregular system.  Through Thomas Young there was a mirror of<br/>Valotti tuning, only starting on a different keynote.</p><p>The other night (March 26, 2005), the AFMM presented four works in Kirnberger<br/>tuning (II).  In my mind, it was near impossible to know what these pieces<br/>would sound like.  The audience was super excited about the music: C.P. Bach,<br/>Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann.  I played bassoon in<br/>the Bach and the Mendelssohn.  The tuning came easily.  People &quot;couldn&apos;t tell<br/>the difference.&quot;  Thing is, all well temperaments sound more similar to each<br/>other than either one would to equal temperament.</p><p>The Romantic period continues extended sixth comma meantone and gradually<br/>eases it into an equal temperament theory.  Brahms and Mahler would benefit from<br/>extended sixth comma meantone.  Schoenberg makes for equal temperament because<br/>it is backed up in Schoenberg&apos;s theory (although he recognizes the harmonic<br/>bases of notes in practice).  Ives idealized an extended Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>I hope this helps.  Certainly there is the wild Vicentino with the few extant<br/>examples of his extra-chromatic technique.  Ah, Beethoven, deaf.</p><p>all best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=58106 href="#58106">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2005 7:37:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ertugrulinanc&quot; &lt;ertugrulinanc@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The point is, I want to retune my MIDI and NWC collection.

Of course, 1/6 comma gives you a<br/>fifth which is a little nearer just, and that has its effect on melody<br/>as well as harmony; it has slightly less of the gentle quality of<br/>flatter versions of meantone, and conveys more briskness. It also, of<br/>course, has a diminished fourth which is closer to a third, which<br/>might be thought desireable.</p><p>Do you have a theory why, in *extended* meantone, 55-et would be<br/>preferred over 31-et? I think it does need to have its own<br/>&quot;Pythagorean&quot; notation system in Scala, certainly. We have 12, 19, and<br/>now 31.

We&apos;ve got 55, a la<br/>Telemann and Mozart. We have 31, close to the classic Pietro Aron 1/4<br/>comma meantone. We have 50, close to 2/7 comma, and near the optimal<br/>meantones of Robert Smith and Wesley Woolhouse (not to mention Paul<br/>Erlich!)

This is quite close to 74-et<br/>meantone. Also, 69-et is close to the Wilson meantone. Since Lucy is<br/>unlikely to accept 88 as a replacement for Lucy Tuning, these are the<br/>most plausible tunings to add. I&apos;ve used 81, since it is optimal or<br/>nearly optimal for some definitions, but probably 50 will do for that.</p></div><h3><a id=58132 href="#58132">ðŸ”—</a>pgreenhaw@nypl.org</h3><span>4/22/2005 11:02:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>__________________________________________</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Honestly, I can no more stand hearing Josquin and others in 12EDO,</p><p>&gt;&gt; Where do you find Josquin in 12EDO?

Is it simply saying that in any<br/>equal temperament notation system, if you take the best fifth, and the<br/>corresponding apotome, any combination of seven nominals f-B plus<br/>flats and sharps will be interpreted in terms of this fifth?</p></div><h3><a id=63411 href="#63411">ðŸ”—</a>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2006 12:43:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; England, perhaps the homeland of the just third,<br/>&gt; produced some independent tuning thinkers (Newton, Thompson,<br/>Bosanquet), came up<br/>&gt; with lots of irregular system.<br/>like<br/><a href="http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.93.0.3/mto.93.0.3.lindley7.gif">http://www.societymusictheory.org/mto/issues/mto.93.0.3/mto.93.0.3.lindley7.gif</a></p><p>53=0: |__|solut|fa|--| 3^0=1<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>8___: |mi|la|re|__|__| 3^-10 ~ 10/9? an schisma 32805/32768 to sharp!<br/>9___: |__|__|__|solut| 3^2=9/8<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>13__: |fa|__|__|__|__| 3^-3=32/27<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>17__: |__|__|mi|la|re| 3^-8 ~ 5/4 also schismatic sharp<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>22__: |solut|fa|--|__| 3^-1=4/3 an 4th<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>26__: |__|__|__|__|mi| 3^-6=1024/729<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>30__: |la|re|__|__|__| 3^-11 ~ 40/27? &quot; &quot; &quot;<br/>31__: |__|__|solut|fa| 3/2 an 5th<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>35__: |--|__|__|__|__| 3^-4=128/81<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>39__: |__|mi|la|re|__| 3^-9 ~ 5/3? &quot; &quot; &quot;<br/>40__: |__|__|__|__|sol 3^3=27/16<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>44__: |ut|fa|--|__|__| 3^-2=16/9<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>48__: |__|__|__|mi|la| 3^-7 ~ 15/8? &quot; &quot; &quot;<br/>____: |__|__|__|__|__| 3^...<br/>52__: |re|__|__|__|__| 3^-12=2/PC ~ ?160/81=2/SC doubtful &quot; &quot; &quot;!<br/>53=0: |__|solut|fa|--| 3^0=1 modulo (any power of) 2</p><p>N.s master scale seems to come from a chain of 11 pure just 5ths</p><p>Ebb re<br/>Bbb la<br/>Fb mi<br/>Cb --<br/>Gb<br/>Db<br/>Ab<br/>Eb<br/>F fa<br/>C ut<br/>G sol</p><p>Choose an arbitrarily 12-tone subset scale out of above 53</p><p>C___0: 1/1____ ut or today &quot;do&quot;<br/>d___8: 3^-10__ re_Newtonian<br/>D___9: 9/8____ RE_Gothic<br/>e__17: 3^-8___ mi_Newtonian<br/>E__18: 81/64__ mi_Gothic<br/>F__22: 4/3____ fa<br/>G__31: 3/2____ sol<br/>a__39: 3^-9___ la_Newtonian<br/>A__40: 27/16__ LA_Gothic<br/>Bb_44: 16/9___ |--|_Newtonian, in german the note:&quot;B&quot;<br/>b__48: 3^-7___ (ti)_NeoGothic, the later german:&quot;h&quot;<br/>B__49: 243/128 (TI)_NeoGothic, the later german:&quot;H&quot;<br/>C&apos;_53: 2/1____ ut&apos;</p><p>Retune your own keyboard-instrument in that ratios<br/>trying out yourself how well it sounds.<br/>Here comes my preferred board-layout,<br/>i&apos;m reccomending to apply above dozen pitches.</p><p>----------------------<br/>_8 key C middle ~264Hz<br/>---------|9=key=C#=Db|<br/>17 key D<br/>---------|18=key=Eb=D#<br/>22 key E<br/>----------------------<br/>31 key F<br/>---------|39=key=F#=Gb|<br/>40 key G<br/>---------|44=key=G#=Ab| ~415Hz<br/>48 key A ~440Hz<br/>---------|49=key=Bb=A#|<br/>53=0 key B<br/>-----------------------<br/>8 key C&apos;<br/>---------|key C# &amp;ct.</p><p>but any other distribution or starting pitch frequency<br/>may be chosen too, as you like.</p><p>Have a lot of fun playing in that!<br/>A.S.</p></div>
