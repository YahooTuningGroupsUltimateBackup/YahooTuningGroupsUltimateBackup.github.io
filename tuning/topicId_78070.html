Aren&apos;t the singers in the video sort of singing and<br/>&gt; whistling at the same time?</p><p>Surely not. The high tones don&apos;t come from whistling, they are overtones of the voice itself. The aim is to make a tiny hole between your tongue and the roof of your mouth and vary its size by variing the shape of your tongue -- and sometimes possibly amplifiing some of the lower overtones by variing the shape of your lips. The reason why you DO have to use your voice in overtone singing is that this makes the overtones tuned to the harmonic series. If you wanted, for example, to do it while whispering, then you would only get glissandi because you would be actually filtering the breathing noise. If you want, I can make such a demo and send it to you. In fact, I don&apos;t know how to explain this in an &quot;understandable&quot; way. As to the recording of mine, I&apos;ve never been taught this, it was simply &quot;trial and error&quot; until it went okay. You may find this article interesting: <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/xoomi.html">www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/xoomi.html</a></p><p>I&apos;ve never done any &quot;tutorials&quot; on how it should be done but other people have. If you wish, you may try this (although the explanation isn&apos;t looking very &quot;systematic&quot; to me personally): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a940YFaRI50">www.youtube.com/watch?v=a940YFaRI50</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;m trying to semi-master Mongolian/Tuvin/Tibetan throat singing myself.<br/>&gt; I can get the larynx to vibrate to do that funny thing and vibrate an<br/>&gt; octave lower (the other day, I somehow get a twelfth lower), but it<br/>&gt; starts getting painful after less than a minute.

But if you already know about Arthur Miles, you probably also know about this website -- don&apos;t know where else you could have got to him.</p><p>And again, it&apos;s important to know it&apos;s nothing to do with whistling.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=78088 href="#78088">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/8/2008 2:42:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sorry, I didn&apos;t realize that the instrument in question<br/>&gt; was an mbira. -Carl</p><p>The only difference between a mbira and a kalimba which I know about is the fact that the metal tongues are much more of a string-like or wire-like shape on a mbira, whereas a kalimba, includingthe one I have, probably most often has them shaped fla -- as if they were tiny rulers or whatever.

alot of stuff i kneed tought, i could be a one woman band but i<br/>dont have<br/>&gt; the gitar nor nothing, i learned cat scratch fever on the 4 string<br/>base<br/>&gt; guitar, i started teaching my self drums, but i am the best on the<br/>piano, i<br/>&gt; wish i could learn how to do recordings and stuff like that, if you<br/>all herd<br/>&gt; it you all would love it, i can play pretty close to any thing i<br/>hear, and i<br/>&gt; rote some music as well, i lost my daddy for christmas i rote that,<br/>it is<br/>&gt; played on the piano, i have been working on the lyricks on a nother<br/>song i<br/>&gt; am riting, all i kneed is people that can play different<br/>instruments other<br/>&gt; than the one i play and we have a great band,  i have played your<br/>teddy bear<br/>&gt; by elvis, hart and soal alone with out 2 people, the boogie woogie<br/>base, but<br/>&gt; more of a rock and roll version, with the slides, it is awsome, if<br/>you all<br/>&gt; can teach me how to record it i can play it for you all but i dont<br/>know how<br/>&gt; to do any of that, you all would think i am a pro believe me. i do<br/>have gods<br/>&gt; gift talent, my grandma used to play the organ and piano the organ<br/>for<br/>&gt; church, my uncle bob used to teach orchestra so much of my family<br/>has talant<br/>&gt;

Don&apos;t know of how much interest this will be to you, but I was very surprised how such a small change could alter the entire character of the sound.

In the first one, the scale is a<br/>regular part<br/>&gt; of the harmonic series from 6 to 16. I used two tracks to record<br/>the<br/>&gt; kalimba, one played at its normal speed and another one played<br/>twice as fast<br/>&gt; to get an extra octave higher.<br/>&gt; I also used a third track where I played the overtone flute and<br/>there&apos;s also<br/>&gt; a bit of my voice at the very end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the second piece, I changed the harmonics to 5-15.
