I&apos;m surprised how easily my trombone-slide arm<br/>can find those places.<br/>Another wondrous source of such modulations is that amazing vocal music from<br/>the Republic of Georgia. It&apos;s usually a 3-voice polyphonythat consistently<br/>modulates for extended periods up or down by an interval I&apos;ve not<br/>determined, but anyway, they always find their way back to the original pitch.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2000 11:23:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jay Williams wrote...</p><p>&gt;Another wondrous source of such modulations is that amazing vocal music<br/>&gt;from the Republic of Georgia.
