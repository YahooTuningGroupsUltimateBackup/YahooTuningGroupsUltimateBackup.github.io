For others, particularly musicians<br/>and those with considerable musical background, the reverse is<br/>true - they find EQT much preferable to JI.</p><p>    My theory can explain both these phenomena.  In many areas,<br/>there is a powerful tendency for people to greatly prefer what<br/>they perceive as authentic over what they perceive to be fake.<br/>Generally, what they perceive to be authentic is what they have<br/>been long familiar with.  I believe that human and animal ears<br/>are particularly sensitive in the area of distinguishing between<br/>the sound (voice, call) of another animal from the sound of<br/>inanimate objects - leaves rustling in the breeze, running water,<br/>raindrops falling, etc., etc.</p><p>    If I am not mistaken, the voices of birds and mammals are<br/>based on the principle of the horn, and the overtones of horn<br/>tones are essentially in a series of perfect integer multiples<br/>of the frequency of the fundamental, with this relationship<br/>being maintained even as the fundamental frequency varies<br/>over time (vibrato, glides).</p><p>    A clue for an animal or human telling that a sound was made<br/>by another animal or was inanimate would be whether or not the<br/>sound had the horn-like overtone structure or not.  If it had a<br/>horn-like overtone structure, it would be from another animal.<br/>If not, it would not be from another living creature and it<br/>probably would be less interesting.</p><p>    Although a polyphonic musical chord in just intonation is not<br/>identical with a horn like single musical note, it seems to me that<br/>it has something of the quality of a &quot;living&quot; sound - with something<br/>resembling the emotional character of being from another living<br/>creature.  I propose that there are mechanisms in our hearing<br/>system (and that of mammals, birds, and other vertebrates) which<br/>are very sensitive to detecting whether even these polyphonic<br/>chords truly have the living horn-like character or not.</p><p>    This could explain the fact that many people find the sound of<br/>justly intoned chords much warmer and more emotionally appealing<br/>than that of even slightly deviating chords performed in 12-EQT.</p><p>    On the other hand, those with extensive musical background in<br/>12-EQT performed music would have had a training-related alteration<br/>in their auditory sound processing systems leading them to respond<br/>to 12-EQT chords as &quot;right&quot; and having &quot;the true musical sound&quot; with<br/>chords in JI sounding &quot;off&quot; and &quot;strange&quot; to them, giving rise in them<br/>to reactions of distaste and even great antipathy.</p><p>    Ralph David Hill    Borrego Springs, CA</p></div><h3><a id=46381 href="#46381">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2003 12:20:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Dave!</p><p>&gt;If I am not mistaken, the voices of birds and mammals are<br/>&gt;based on the principle of the horn, and the overtones of horn<br/>&gt;tones are essentially in a series of perfect integer multiples<br/>&gt;of the frequency of the fundamental, with this relationship<br/>&gt;being maintained even as the fundamental frequency varies<br/>&gt;over time (vibrato, glides).</p><p>I&apos;m not sure about birds, but human voices, as I&apos;m sure you<br/>know, are perfectly harmonic.</p><p>&gt;    A clue for an animal or human telling that a sound was made<br/>&gt;by another animal or was inanimate would be whether or not the<br/>&gt;sound had the horn-like overtone structure or not.

I think we use a lot of<br/>the same machinery to hear vowels and intonation in speech that we<br/>use to listen to music.</p><p>If you&apos;ve been following the list recently, you saw this:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_46259.html#46355">/tuning/topicId_46259.html#46355</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div>
