A lot of the reported local minima involve the unison and the octave, which seems correct, and 700 cents which is v close to 3/2.

Longer answer:<br/>Initially I calculated HE at points (x,y) on a grid 0..1200 step 10; found the local minima; then refined the location of each minimum by a search method; on occasion this resulted in x or y straying outside the original bounds.  This is an artifact of the way I have done the calculation and needs to be fixed.</p><p>I believe that the function should be symmetrical about the lines x=0 and y=0 (and x+y=0 because we are really in triad space) and therefore any minimum near these lines should really be exactly on the line (unless there really is a pair straddling the line).</p><p>In my attempts to limit the number of JI triads considered for each point (x,y) I may have ended up with not enough points outside the grid area.  I am working on this, but any comments are welcome.</p><p>Steve M.</p></div><h3><a id=93878 href="#93878">ðŸ”—</a>martinsj013 &#x3C;martinsj@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2010 4:05:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; In my attempts to limit the number of JI triads considered for each point (x,y) I may have ended up with not enough points outside the grid area.

So I guess you mean to place a 1-cent grid around the vicinity of each local minimum on the 10-cent grid?

The formula I have for the consonance value of an interval (using sine wave tones only) is:<br/>(2 + 1/x + 1/y - y/x)/2....where y/x &lt; 0.9375 or 15/16.<br/>It seems to me that all intervals with a value less than 0.75 are dissonant. Between 0.75 and 0.99999 are Minor and 1.0 or higher are Major.<br/>I then used my formula in a more convoluted way for chords with three or more notes and to my surprise I found that the six note E minor chord (again using only sine wave tones):<br/>10:15:20:24:30:40<br/>has a value of around -0.49.<br/>Yet it still sounds okay.<br/>This indicates to me that as long as all the intervals (pairs of notes) in a chord are good then the chord should be good.<br/>In other words if the Harmonic Entropy theory is correct for pairs of notes (intervals) then there&apos;s no need to consider Triadic HE because if all the intervals that occur are good, then the chord should be good.</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Steve wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, I&apos;m working through Carl&apos;s list (slowly).
