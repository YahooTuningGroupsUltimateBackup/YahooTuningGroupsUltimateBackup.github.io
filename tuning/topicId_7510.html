(Which I GUESS are &quot;puns&quot;<br/>or &quot;homophones&quot; -- I am unclear)</p><p>If I understand the Vincentino system he proposes, it is ESSENTIALLY in<br/>meantone, since the roots are in meantone.  However, if the progression<br/>were more elaborate, with more roots involved, would this mean that the<br/>comma drift would be re-distributed AGAIN, divided by the number of roots??<br/> I imagine it would.</p><p>Of course, this kind of system including just intonation would not work<br/>with any fixed keyboard mechanism (standard), but only with instruments<br/>that could &quot;adapt&quot; in real time. (??)</p><p>I would enjoy seeing harmonic progression charts like this that go a bit<br/>further -- let&apos;s say at least to the vi of the common harmonic progression.<br/> So far, we&apos;ve only been dealing with I, IV, ii, V, I, which seems a tad<br/>limited.</p><p>By the way, the Alan Forte harmony book, which has been resurfacing in so<br/>many ways on the list of late, is really a fine volume, for what it is.  It<br/>is one of the few harmony texts that didn&apos;t incite immediate vomit with me,<br/>and I used it for review in my doctoral studies.  I particularly remember a<br/>large number of exercises in four-part harmony, which were good practice.<br/>I do have a copy of the book, but it is one of those books that stays in my<br/>library.  Unfortunately, the Walter Piston harmony text, in contrast, did<br/>not have a salutary effect.  (His orch. book is pretty decent, though...)</p><p>Thanks again for the posts, and I would be interested in seeing further<br/>efforts that try to combine traditional tonal practice with just intonation<br/>theory...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=7527 href="#7527">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

That is, the only ones which won&apos;t work are<br/>ones which use enharmonic equivalents, e.g., G#=Ab. These types of<br/>progressions became important with Schubert and his successors. In meantone,<br/>this is a shift of about 40 cents. To learn more about what works and what<br/>doesn&apos;t work in meantone and why most things don&apos;t work in strict JI, read<br/>Blackwood&apos;s _Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_.</p><p>&gt;Thanks again for the posts, and I would be interested in seeing further<br/>&gt;efforts that try to combine traditional tonal practice with just intonation<br/>&gt;theory...</p><p>This is a multifaceted issue and</p></div>
