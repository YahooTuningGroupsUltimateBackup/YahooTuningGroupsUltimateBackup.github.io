I for one have not heard of CCRMA for which I<br/>apologize. It seems unlike the sciences, the arts have seemed to benefited<br/>little from such organizations. These institutions seem to have produced<br/>little outside of groundbreaking technologies for new commercial products.<br/>They are further limited by the fact that the &quot;mass&quot; that makes them up,<br/>requires of its members the acceptance of the views of those with the most<br/>power. The members therefore cannot present ideas that might undermine or<br/>even ignore the directions of this elite. These institutions  nip more ideas<br/>in the bud more than nurture the possibilities of new ones.<br/>    I do not think that Carl was addressing you as an individual, just an<br/>organization you have some relationship to. After all , can they take credit<br/>for your work!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
