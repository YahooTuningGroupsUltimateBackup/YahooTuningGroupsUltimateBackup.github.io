It is my honest and carefully<br/>considered opinion that the album is quite good!  It really works.  I don&apos;t<br/>have a problem ranking it with either of the JI Network compilations.</p><p>Here are my favorites...</p><p>1. New Awakening (Gary Morrison):  Pure kickass.  Mr. Morrison proves his<br/>enormous potential as a composer.  88CET is cool, but I wish he wouldn&apos;t<br/>focus on it exclusively.  The old Ensoniq is sounding rather, well, bad.</p><p>2. Limp off to School (John Starrett):  Rock on!  John is one of the most<br/>impressive musicians I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.  This song has<br/>got it all.</p><p>3. Certified notions (John Starrett):  Another winner from Starrett.  I<br/>find it strange that nobody seems to be taking credit for these vocals...</p><p>4. Just on Time (Bill Alves):  Profoundly beautiful, well performed.<br/>Classic Alves.</p><p>Here are ones that are very good, but somehow fall short of my favorite<br/>mark...</p><p>1. Mood of Neptune/Ashes Before the Sky, Stephen James Taylor:  I have to<br/>disagree with the critic at Westword; this tune is cool, and works fine as<br/>an opener (for both CD and ear).  Potential problems with being too dark or<br/>conceptual are totally avoided because it *succeeds* in taking you there.</p><p>2. Kaleidophon (Carter Scholz):  Mind expanding!  In fact, regarding recent<br/>talk about the tonality diamond, I believe this is a rhythmic diamond --<br/>all circular permutations of a rhythm played simultaneously.  [Carter,<br/>please straighten me out if this is not the piece.]  I like all of Carter&apos;s<br/>stuff.  In fact, his stuff is probably the best algo-comp I&apos;ve heard.  For<br/>me, however, algo-comp can never quite break out of a sort of realm.  Not<br/>that it&apos;s bad, mechanical, intellectual, or any of that.  Just that it<br/>lacks a sort of shine.  Hard to explain.</p><p>3. Duet for Morphine and Cymbal (Bill Sethares):  Sethares&apos; work is<br/>extremely important because it explores the extent to which harmony is meta<br/>timbre.  Listening to his stuff is like sending your ear to graduate<br/>school.  I do have serious reservations about the strong version of the<br/>consonance=beatless theory, regarding the ear&apos;s innate preference for<br/>harmonic partials, as demonstrated by the virtual pitch phenomenon and the<br/>persistence of my ear, despite much listening, to hear many of the adaptive<br/>timbres as &quot;coming apart&quot;, causing a loss of &quot;bandwidth&quot;, a reduction of<br/>the number of independent parts I can follow compared to a beatless tuning<br/>with harmonic timbres.  Fortunately, Bill doesn&apos;t really subscribe to the<br/>strong version himself, and his book &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum and Scale&quot;<br/>is very objective, first-rate stuff, presenting all sides and never<br/>insisting on anything without good reason.</p><p>4. Glass Lake (Sethares):  I like everything on &quot;Xentonality&quot;, but I think<br/>&quot;Three Ears&quot; is really something special, and would have had it before<br/>Glass Lake or Morphine.</p><p>Worth a listen...</p><p>1. Matrix (Denny Genovese):  This is really a great tune.  Unfortunately,<br/>the CD seems to have &quot;revealed the limitations of the analog source.&quot;<br/>Also, I am not particularly fond of this performance.  I have a version<br/>done on TX-81Z that I like much better.  Theremin part clouds the thing.</p><p>2. Resuscitation (John Loffink):  Synthesis is good.  Music is disconnected.</p><p>3. Snake Dance (Neil Haverstick):  Interesting but unconvincing.</p><p>4. Vilano (Ernie Crews):  Nice idea but too long and self-absorbed.<br/>Well-played, but riffs do not compensate for sparseness of material.</p><p>5. Pient Molles (Rick Sanford):  You can hear some of the melodic potential<br/>of 10tET.  You can also hear yourself slapping three of these out between<br/>lunch and dinner.</p><p>6. Evening in Landcox Park (Waren Burt):  I wouldn&apos;t spend an evening in<br/>Landcox Park without it.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=137 href="#137">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/1999 3:41:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Carl for the CD review (and of course thanks for the compliments my<br/>contribution in particular).
