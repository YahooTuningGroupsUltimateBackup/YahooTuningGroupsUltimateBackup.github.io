Does Cesar Jurez has an e-mail<br/>address? I&apos;m working on Carrillo&apos;s music for quartertone guitar. He might be<br/>pleased to find out someone in Europe is actually playing this kind of<br/>repertory. I made some private recordings which can be downloaded from:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/music.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/music.html</a></p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
