I do think there is a case for including the slashed flat, reversed flat and half-sharp (one vertical stroke, two diagonal) since they&apos;re all used in printed Arabic music. Other symbols used in Turkish notation, such as the double-stroke flat and three-diagonal stroke sharps, and the p-shaped half-flat and the half-sharp shaped like a greater-sign sign with two vertical strokes (koron and sori) used in Iranian music, should also be considered.</p><p>Now not just any joe can propose additions to Unicode; one has to get sponsored and present a nice professional proposal, and it takes a while to work through the process.
