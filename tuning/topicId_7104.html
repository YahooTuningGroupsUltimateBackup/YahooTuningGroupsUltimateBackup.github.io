This is clearly a 5-odd-limit.<br/>&gt;Hmmm... then again, it *could* be a 5-prime-limit too,<br/>&gt;couldn&apos;t it?...</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. In what sense do you think it could?</p><p>&gt;Well... the whole point of Woolhouse&apos;s book is to present<br/>&gt;and explain tunings that he feels are better than 12-tET<br/>&gt;(or 12-EDO), and considering the fact that he goes thru all<br/>&gt;the trouble of determining 7/26-comma meantone, and finding<br/>&gt;the more practical 50-EDO close approximation to it, and then<br/>&gt;finally accepts 19-EDO as more practical still, it seems<br/>&gt;awfully strange that he uses such strong language when he<br/>&gt;says &apos;This scale [12-tET] is, *WITHOUT DOUBT* [emphasis mine],<br/>&gt;the best one for such instruments...&apos;.</p><p>&gt;Sounds to me like, just for that one moment, he was succumbing<br/>&gt;to the status-quo simply because of the improbability that anyone<br/>&gt;would go thru the trouble to build an instrument to his<br/>&gt;specifications.  Maybe it&apos;s just the way I&apos;m reading it.</p><p>To me, he&apos;s being perfectly consistent, because at the time of his writing,<br/>virtually any piece in the repertoire would have called for more than 12<br/>written pitches, so on an instrument with only 12 notes, any of the &quot;better&quot;<br/>meantone tunings would not work -- only a closed 12-pitch system, such as<br/>12-tET, would.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; It should be obvious that the 5-limit lattice can be extended<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; infinitely in both dimensions by adding on additional cells<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; just like this one (or parts of it), thus proving Woolhouse&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; statement.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Not sure what it proves.</p><p>&gt;It proves what he said in the part I quoted just before that:</p><p>&gt; [Woolhouse 1835, p 45]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; the *third-minor*, *third-major* and *fourth*, are the only<br/>&gt;&gt; concords necessary to be considered, because the others are<br/>&gt;&gt; merely the inversions of these, and we know that any error<br/>&gt;&gt; which may increase or diminish a concord, will have precisely<br/>&gt;&gt; the same effect in decreasing or increasing its inversion</p><p>&gt;You can see plainly on the lattice that all these intervals<br/>&gt;and their inversions can be added on infinitely in any direction<br/>&gt;without involving any other intervals, which was his point.</p><p>I think you&apos;re misunderstanding something.</p><p>&gt;A side note: those who have looked at my webpage of this will<br/>&gt;see that I&apos;ve changed &apos;tET&apos; to &apos;EDO&apos; in every case.  I did<br/>&gt;that because Woolhouse specifically states that the &apos;octave&apos;<br/>&gt;is always to be a 1:2 ratio.</p><p>Seems to me like &apos;tET&apos; would be better then, since &apos;tET&apos;s always assume a<br/>1:2 octave, at least around here (where we discuss such things as<br/>27.35-tET).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Smith&apos;s ideal tuning was almost exactly 5/18-comma meantone,<br/>&gt;&gt; which is close to 50-tET but on the other side of it relative<br/>&gt;&gt; to 7/26-comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;How do you know that?!  Do you have access to Smith&apos;s book?!<br/>&gt;Tell us more!!</p><p>Well, at first I thought it was exactly 5/18-comma meantone, based on<br/>Mandelbaum. For a derivation of 5/18-comma meantone as an &quot;optimal&quot; tuning<br/>(by different criteria from Woolhouse&apos;s, of course), see my posting from<br/>Brett Barbaro&apos;s address in TD 134.10 (5/7/99). But then I read Jorgenson,<br/>who gave Smith&apos;s equation (supposedly derived from beat rates), and the<br/>solution to that equation is ever-so-slightly different from 5/18-comma<br/>meantone. I actually don&apos;t know who&apos;s right. Someone should check Barbour as<br/>well.</p><p>&gt;Paul, let me know if you mind my<br/>&gt;adding your postings to the webpage - I think they&apos;re<br/>&gt;valuable commentary</p><p>Go ahead!</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d love to be able to figure out an accurate lattice diagram<br/>&gt;of the actual Woolhouse/Erlich 7/26-comma meantone, to accompany<br/>&gt;the simple one of its 5-limit JI implications.  Actually, my<br/>&gt;lattice formula can probably already do it...</p><p>I have no idea what you mean.</p></div><h3><a id=7107 href="#7107">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The first few pages of both &gt;contain information on the<br/>proposed tuning system of Robert Smith. According to Mandelbaum, Smith&apos;s<br/>ideal fifth in his<br/>&gt;1759 _Harmonics_ is flat by, you guessed it, 5/18 of a comma. Mandelbaum&apos;s<br/>description makes it seem as if Smith &gt;might have used the same derivation<br/>as me. According to Jorgenson, however, Smith&apos;s ideal fifth derived from<br/>equal-beating<br/>&gt;considerations and satisfies the equation 3x^3+4x=16. That implies a fifth<br/>0.0027 cents smaller than that of 5/18-comma &gt;meantone. Though this is<br/>really splitting paramecial hairs, anyone know who&apos;s right about Smith?</p></div>
