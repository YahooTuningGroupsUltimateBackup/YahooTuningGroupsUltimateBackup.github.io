Another list<br/>member had seemed to volunteer to pick pieces to test, but he has a<br/>strange resistance to choosing particular works for which an actual<br/>MIDI sequence exists.  Therefore he has resigned from that post, and<br/>the job is wide open.</p><p>I invite everyone on this list to suggest pieces (with actual available<br/>GM sequence for each suggested piece).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=848 href="#848">🔗</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2001 10:23:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I scripsit:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I invite everyone on this list to suggest pieces (with actual<br/>&gt;&gt;available GM sequence for each suggested piece).</p><p>[Jeff Scott scripsit:]<br/>&gt;Yay! OK!</p><p>&gt;1. Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, attributed to J.S.<br/>&gt;Bach. (lots of MIDI versions available)</p><p>Har!  That&apos;s a hot piece, all right.  Tough to render from MIDI, but<br/>I&apos;ll do it.  Is there some doubt that he wrote it, BTW?</p><p>&gt;2. Les Barricades Mysterieuses by Franois Couperin.<br/>&gt;(Haven&apos;t found a good MIDI file of this yet -- hoping<br/>&gt;someone has a good one or perhaps we can talk one of<br/>&gt;the cembalists around into recording a nice one.)</p><p>If you find it, I&apos;ll tune it.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
