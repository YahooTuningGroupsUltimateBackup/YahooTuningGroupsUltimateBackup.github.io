Another list<br/>member had seemed to volunteer to pick pieces to test, but he has a<br/>strange resistance to choosing particular works for which an actual<br/>MIDI sequence exists.  Therefore he has resigned from that post, and<br/>the job is wide open.</p><p>I invite everyone on this list to suggest pieces (with actual available<br/>GM sequence for each suggested piece).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=848 href="#848">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2001 10:23:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I scripsit:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I invite everyone on this list to suggest pieces (with actual<br/>&gt;&gt;available GM sequence for each suggested piece).</p><p>[Jeff Scott scripsit:]<br/>&gt;Yay!
