I didn&apos;t mean to insult your intelligence.<br/>Clearly there<br/>&gt;are dozens of distinct musical cultures within the Arabic world,<br/>and perhaps<br/>&gt;as many schemes for fretted instruments. Although quartertones have<br/>become<br/>&gt;&quot;standard&quot;, you Kraig may be lucky enough to have recordings representing<br/>&gt;older, more local traditions. Also, there is the question of what is<br/>&gt;considered &quot;Arabic&quot; -- for example, where do you draw the lines<br/>between the<br/>&gt;Turkish or Armenian worlds and the Arabic world?</p><p>Actually if you examine the work of Scott Marcus and Habib Hassan<br/>Touma, there are more similarilties between Turkish and Armenian<br/>tuning to Arabic tuning than differences. The quarter tone was only a<br/>recent theoretical development by Mishaqah c1850. The main<br/>theoretical instrument, the &apos;ud, oscillates between fretted and<br/>fretless (currently so), but even when fretted, the frets are tied on<br/>in the same manner as the Turkish saz as well its cousin, the Arabic<br/>buzuq. Frankly, I don&apos;t know of a single fixed fret instrument used<br/>in Arabic/Turkish performance, with the obvious exception of the<br/>12TET electric guitar used by Mohammed Abdel Wahab c1950s, can anyone<br/>inform me?</p><p>The frets are moved according to the Maqam and given the majority of<br/>musicians in the Levant or Maghreb learn from an oral tradition (the<br/>exceptions being Egyptian or Lebanese conservatorium musicians who<br/>perform in the relatively recent Arabic orchestras), it is highly<br/>unlikely you will find a performer playing true (tempered) quarter<br/>tones. The performers natural inclination will be to resolve to<br/>consonant intervals, i.e. the Pythagorean derivations of al&apos;Farabi or<br/>Safi al&apos;Din Urmawi (umm, the names are from memory, apols if their<br/>not quite right).</p><p>Of course it is possible to theorise that the performers recorded<br/>have exceptionally adjusted their fretted instruments using a tuner<br/>prior to a recording session, but this again seems highly unlikely.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PhdThesis">@PhdThesis</a>{marcus:arab_theory,<br/>  author = &#x9; &quot;Scott L.

Every saz of every variety I<br/>have ever seen has movable frets, ditto the Arabic buzuq. The Greek<br/>bouzouki has hammered in frets though (12TET), but they are quite<br/>different in timbre and playing technique and not easily confused.</p><p>Likewise the dutar and tar have moveable frets, for example, check<br/>the instrument retailer:</p><p><a href="http://www.mhs.mendocino.k12.ca.us/MenComNet/Business/Retail/Larknet/MiddleEasternStrings">http://www.mhs.mendocino.k12.ca.us/MenComNet/Business/Retail/Larknet/MiddleEasternStrings</a></p><p>According to Touma&apos;s book, the tetrachord was divided into 10<br/>intervals, although some of these are quite high denominators, the<br/>3/4 tone is typically around 180 cents and neutral third at 384 cents<br/>(this is from memory, I&apos;ll post the exact divisions tomorrow). With<br/>the division of the tone, this produces 25 intervals per octave.<br/>Another approach was by the addition of pythagorean commas and limmas<br/>to produce slightly different derivation of the tetrachord but that<br/>still resulted in 25 _theoretical_ intervals.

When that issue<br/>is combined with rapid passages on the &apos;ud where the fingering won&apos;t<br/>be perfect; or with two drone courses (A and D) on the saz which will<br/>mask the single line behind the chorused dyad drone, the accuracy of<br/>the scale is becoming a moot point in the context of *performance*.</p><p>--<br/>Leigh Smith                 <a href="mailto:leigh@tomandandy.com">leigh@tomandandy.com</a> (MIME)<br/>tomandandy                  +1-212-334-0421 (W) +1-212-334-0422 (F)<br/>                            89 Greene St. New York, NY 10012, USA<br/>                            <a href="http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~leigh">http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~leigh</a><br/>Microsoft - What do you want to re-install today?</p></div><h3>Paul H.

However, Segah, as good<br/>music should be, is often non-anthropomorphic &gt;(i.e., expresses feelings<br/>beyond known human emotions). In short, Segah is usually not very &gt;serious.</p><p>&gt;Segah is played in a very non-western scale. Here is Segah from C:</p><p>&gt;C   D    E-60cents    F    G     A-60cents   Bb    C</p><p>&gt;where one chromatic &quot;Pardeh&quot; or a whole-tone is equal to 200 cents.<br/>Dara&apos;amad is an improvised &gt;free melody played in the C---G interval<br/>concentrating mostly on E (E koron = E-60cents). Zabol is &gt;also improvised<br/>between E and A with emphasis on G.</p><p>&gt;Dara&apos;amad and Zabol are two Gushehs (melodic &quot;corners&quot;) from the many<br/>Gushes that exist in the &gt;vocal or the instrumental repertoire of Segah,<br/>Hence, we get the word Dastgah (collection of &gt;melodies).</p><p>&gt;At the peak of Segah, with almost zero time for transition, Segah<br/>transforms into an entirely &gt;different scale: Mokhalif-e Segah (lit.<br/>&quot;Segah&apos;s Opponent&quot; or Anti-Segah).</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s the scale of Mokhalif from C:</p><p>&gt;C   D    Eb     F     G     A-60cents    B-60cents      C</p><p>&gt;which is closer to the minor scale. Not only is this transition not<br/>annoying to the ear, it is breath-&gt;taking. Listen for this transition in #2<br/>and #7. Mokhalif resembles a monster that comes out of the<br/>&gt;innocent-sounding Segah. It is serious, it is protesting, and without a<br/>doubt beautiful and &gt;astounding.</p><p>Clearly one is not dealing with 180-cent 3/4-tones, whatever Touma or<br/>Safi-al-Din may say.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/1999 3:05:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul !<br/>    I don&apos;t hear a neutral tone from a 180 cent interval either.

Yes, and the author would probably be the first<br/>to admit as much. Did it even remotely conform to your chip-on-the-shoulder<br/>diatribe. Not in the least. When I &apos;publish&apos; pieces on the Meadows I have a<br/>clear intent: to inform about matters relating to Partch, and I take into<br/>account the wide variety of writers that may have something of interest to<br/>say, in spite of the fact that every corner might not conform to rigorously<br/>scholastic standards. In this respect, these type of articles I see no need<br/>to issue corrections or disclaimers.

If anyone else<br/>cares to supply them here, I can snip them and paste into<br/>the webpage.  (Thanks in advance for expanding all of our<br/>collective knowledges of an important body of tuning evidence.)<br/>The references were, if I recall, mainly Partch&apos;s _Genesis_<br/>and Ellis in Helmholtz&apos;s _On the Sensations of Tone_.<br/>(I know, I&apos;m being really lazy tonight... I&apos;m exhausted<br/>after a road trip to Montreal; what a fantastic weekend...<br/>I digress... ... send the page numbers along too...)</p><p>All three are rational systems, that is, no intervals are<br/>precisely quarter-tones. The ancient fretting was an extended<br/>Pythagorean (3-Limit) system.  Zalzal added ratios containing<br/>11 as a factor, and Mahmoud and Abdulqadir replaced those with<br/>a further extension of the Pythagorean system, including enough<br/>notes to emulate a compact 5-limit system, similar to what I<br/>describe about Indian tuning here:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/indian/indian.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/indian/indian.htm</a><br/>(I know, all of this should be on the webpage... the Indian<br/>page also needs to be much more comprehensive...)</p><p>As always, I welcome criticism or positive feedback,<br/>and if anything is definitely wrong, *please* submit an<br/>informative correction - graphics are encouraged; I&apos;ll add<br/>them to my page.  I&apos;d love to include more examples to<br/>really flesh out the history of this and other related<br/>ethnic/cultural frettings, especially African ones.  I&apos;d<br/>particularly be delighted to discover connections between<br/>West-African frettings and how they may have influenced the<br/>music of American, Caribbean, and Brazilian slaves.</p><p>(Hmmm... a polymicrotonal opera called &apos;Musical Roots&apos;,<br/>based on Robert Johnson instead of Alex Haley?...<br/>Anyone want to collaborate?...)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
