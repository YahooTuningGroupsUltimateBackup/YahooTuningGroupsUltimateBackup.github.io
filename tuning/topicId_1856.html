How<br/>&gt; can this be taken into account?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bill Sethares<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Dear Mr. Sethares,</p><p>Thank you for your interest in my comments on the tuning list. As you<br/>rightfully point out this approach is universal, and can be applied to any<br/>monophonic music. I have seen inklings of these ideas in the works of Carl<br/>Seashore of the University of Iowa in the 1930s. His book on this subject<br/>is titled &quot;Psychology of Music&quot;, 1938, McGraw-Hill.</p><p>My work is yet at an embryonic stage. I have been able to analyze<br/>improvisations from only from a few master musicians coming from the<br/>&apos;dergah&apos; era. However, my findings so far are very consistent with my<br/>notion of representing musical scales by distributions. A comprehensive<br/>publication displaying my findings in the form of time plots and<br/>histograms is under preparation. A colleague of mine and I had a sample<br/>presentation at the annual meeting of the study group &apos;maqam&apos; of the<br/>ICTM in October 1998, held in Istanbul. I would be happy to send you a<br/>copy of that paper if you wish to see it. Please let me know by e-mail.</p><p>I will try to address the points you have reaised in your very kind post.</p><p>(1) Deviations from an &apos;anchor&apos; sound forming the said distributions<br/>(clusters) seem to be part of a mysterious plan on the part of the artist.<br/>The size and the shape of these deviations vary between clusters,<br/>suggesting a stochastic &apos;order&apos; of some sort. However, at his point I am<br/>speculating and I need to process many more sample improvisations before<br/>significant patterns begin to emerge.</p><p>(2) You are on the mark here. During the course of an improvisation,<br/>which can be viewed as a &apos;journey&apos; over a finite set of distributions,<br/>the pitch for a given note seems to depend on where the music &apos;has been&apos;<br/>for the past &quot;k&quot; steps, including the preceding sound, before getting to<br/>that note. This feature makes me think in terms of a model which has<br/>some form of long and short term memory.</p><p>(3) Although my work is limited to monophonic music at his point in time,<br/>I can relate to what you are suggesting for &quot;vertical context&quot;, as in<br/>polyphonic music. The mathematics that could evolve in such modeling would<br/>probably be very complex and exciting. This would be a natural extension<br/>of what I am trying to do for monopnonic music.</p><p>Your comments have been very stimulating. I thank you for taking the time<br/>in formulating your thoughts in such an organized manner, and I hope to<br/>hear from you again.</p><p>Sincerely.</p><p>Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>Mobile, Alabama 36604-2519<br/>Phone: (334) 441-2126<br/>Fax  : (334) 441-3290</p></div><h3><a id=1865 href="#1865">ðŸ”—</a>Can Akkoc &#x3C;akkoc@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/1999 9:51:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 19 Mar 1999, Polychroni Moniodis wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Polychroni Moniodis &lt;<a href="mailto:upb_moniodis@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU">upb_moniodis@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 19 Mar 99, at 9:38, William Sethares wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: William Sethares &lt;<a href="mailto:sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu">sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Dan Akkoc wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Since the musicians seem to be creating their own non-deterministic<br/>&gt; &gt; stochastic scales in the form of distributions, why not make an attempt to<br/>&gt; &gt; construct mathematical characterizations in a stochastic setting?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is an interesting view of scales and I would very much<br/>&gt; &gt; like to see some concrete examples of how pitches are distributed<br/>&gt; &gt; about the nominal values in performances.

Moniodis<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Gentlemen,<br/>I am enjoying this debate immensely!   Dr. Moniodis&apos;s comments and<br/>questions are well taken. I am certain I will be running into such<br/>fundamental issues and many others as my research evolves and matures. At<br/>this point I am unable to distinguish between an improvisation from a<br/>legendary performer and a poor performer since my data base is still at a<br/>very primitive state. I am hoping one day maybe I will be able to capture<br/>the stochastic &apos;secrets&apos; of legendary master musicians that sets them<br/>apart from just &apos;good&apos; performers. This glimmer of hope is probably based<br/>on the incredibly complex, and yet not fully understood, potential of one<br/>of the most impressive &quot;sensors&quot; in the universe, the human ear.</p><p>The second paragraph deals with the issue of resolution of the human ear,<br/>and a lot of research have been done in this area. I am certain there is<br/>room for more research in this direction.</p><p>I like the idea of eliminating the &quot;performance aspect&quot; in order to filter<br/>out personal stylistics from consideration, thereby capturing the<br/>universal &quot;invariants&quot; unique to each maqam like a finger print. It looks<br/>like a very sophisticated task though.</p><p>I appreciate the input and look forward to more of the same.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>Mobile, Alabama 36604-2519<br/>Phone: (334) 441-2126<br/>Fax  : (334) 441-3290</p></div><h3><a id=1866 href="#1866">ðŸ”—</a>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>3/19/1999 10:24:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: William Sethares &lt;<a href="mailto:sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu">sethares@eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dan Akkoc wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Since the musicians seem to be creating their own non-deterministic<br/>&gt;&gt;stochastic scales in the form of distributions, why not make an attempt to<br/>&gt;&gt;construct mathematical characterizations in a stochastic setting?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is an interesting view of scales and I would very much<br/>&gt;like to see some concrete examples of how pitches are distributed<br/>&gt;about the nominal values in performances.
