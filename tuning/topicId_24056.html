This latter diesis is equal to the<br/>difference between three pure 5:4 major thirds up (125:64) and a pure<br/>2:1 octave, and is also equal to the difference in 1/4-comma between<br/>G# and Ab, for example.</p><p>The 29-tET diesis is likewise equal to the amount by which three<br/>regular major thirds of 10/29 octave (~413.79 cents) exceed a 2:1<br/>octave, here a single scale step of 1/29 octave.</p><p>The 29-tET diesis is _positive_, with G# _above_ Ab (as also in<br/>Pythagorean tuning, where the Pythagorean comma is equivalent to this<br/>diesis); the meantone diesis is _negative_, with G# _below_ Ab.[1]</p><p>In a 5-based JI system, the 25:24 ratio which you mentioned defines<br/>the chromatic semitone (e.g. C-C#) or difference between the pure 5:4<br/>major third and the 6:5 minor third (e.g. A-C#, A-C). The use of this<br/>interval as a direct melodic step is one definition of 16th-century<br/>&quot;chromaticism,&quot; with direct use of the diesis or fifthtone is termed<br/>&quot;enharmonicism&quot; (e.g. Nicola Vicentino, 1555), since the diesis<br/>resembles in its size the dieses of the ancient Greek enharmonic<br/>genus.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Maximal/mininal intervals and the cadential diesis<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>While the most common regular intervals of 29-tET are quite close to<br/>those of Pythagorean tuning, with fifths and fourths tempered by only<br/>about 1.49 cents in the wide and narrow directions respectively, the<br/>41-cent diesis has a quality which seems distinct from that of either<br/>a Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents) or a usual<br/>&quot;semitone&quot; starting somewhere 50 cents, or possibly a bit smaller.</p><p>The distinctive quality of the diesis as direct neo-Gothic cadential<br/>step is exemplified in progressions such as the following, very<br/>typical of 24-out-of-29-tET with two keyboards tuned a diesis apart.<br/>Here C4 is middle C, numbers in parentheses show rounded intervals in<br/>cents between a given voice and any higher voices, and signed numbers<br/>show ascending (+) or descending (-) melodic steps. An ASCII asterisk<br/>(*) shows a note raised by a diesis:</p><p>      E*4 --  +41 -- F4            F4  --  -41 -- E*4<br/>     (497)          (497)         (703)          (703)<br/>      B*3 --  +41 -- C4            Bb3 --  -41 -- A*3<br/>   (952,455)      (1200,703)    (952,248)       (703,0)<br/>      G3  -- -207 -- F3            G*3 -- +207 -- A*3</p><p>         (M6-8 + M3-5)                (m7-5 + m3-1)</p><p>In the first progression, an extra-wide major third expands to a fifth<br/>(M3-5), and an extra-wide major sixth to an octave (M6-8), one voice<br/>in either of these resolutions descending by a usual whole-tone and<br/>the other ascending by a 41-cent diesis, taking the role as it were of<br/>a cadential semitone.</p><p>In the second progression, an extra-narrow minor third contracts to a<br/>unison (m3-1), and an extra-narrow minor seventh to a fifth (m7-5),<br/>with the same melodic steps -- this time an ascending whole-tone and<br/>descending diesis.</p><p>This use of the 41-cent diesis as a direct cadential step in moving<br/>from an unstable interval to a stable one by stepwise contrary motion<br/>seems to me strongly to distinguish this step in 29-tET from the<br/>Pythagorean or septimal comma. At least, while I&apos;ve used comma shifts<br/>in various contexts, I haven&apos;t attempted to substitute such a comma<br/>for a usual diatonic cadential semitone; in contrast, this is maybe<br/>the most common use of the 29-tET diesis.</p><p>A charming feature of 29-tET is that the extra-large or &quot;maximal&quot;<br/>sixth is identical to the extra-narrow or &quot;minimal&quot; seventh -- both<br/>23/29 octave, or ~951.72 cents (very close to 26:15, ~952.26 cents),<br/>making possible &quot;puns&quot; like the following example on a 24-note<br/>keyboard:</p><p>      F4  --  -41 -- E*4            F4  --  +41 -- F*4<br/>     (248)           (0)           (248)          (497)<br/>      D*4 -- +207 -- E*4            D*4 -- -207 -- C*4<br/>   (952,703)      (703,703)      (952,703)      (1200,703)<br/>      G*3 -- +207 -- A*3            G*3 -- -207 -- F*3</p><p>         (m7-5 + m3-1)                (M6-8 + M2-4)</p><p>In these examples, the unstable sonority G*3-D*4-F4 (0-703-952 cents)<br/>is identical, but invites two different interpretations.</p><p>In the first interpretation, the 952-cent interval between the outer<br/>voices represents a small minor seventh contracting to a fifth, and<br/>the 248-cent interval between the upper voices (more precisely ~248.28<br/>cents) a small minor third contracting to a unison.</p><p>In the second interpretation, however, the 952-cent interval instead<br/>represents a large major sixth expanding to an octave, and the<br/>248-cent interval a large major second between the upper voices<br/>expanding to the upper fourth of the resolving 2:3:4 trine<br/>F*3-C*4-F*4. (In Gothic or neo-Gothic music, a trine is a complete or<br/>saturated stable sonority with outer octave, lower fifth, and upper<br/>fourth).</p><p>-----------------------------<br/>2. Supraminor/submajor thirds<br/>-----------------------------</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, diminished fourths and augmented seconds have<br/>ratios of 8192:6561 (~384.36 cents) and 19683:16384 (~317.60 cents),<br/>only a 3-5-schisma from a pure 5:4 (~386.31 cents) or 6:5 (~315.64<br/>cents). Because of this small difference of a 3-5-schisma<br/>(32805:32768), they are often known as &quot;schisma thirds.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, at least in a neo-Gothic context, corresponding 29-tET<br/>intervals have a certain affinity to submajor and supraminor thirds at<br/>around 21:17 (~365.83 cents) and 17:14 (~336.13 cents). In 29-tET,<br/>these alternative thirds have sizes of 9/29 octave or ~372.41 cents,<br/>and 8/29 octave or ~331.03 cents.</p><p>Here is a typical 29-tET cadence featuring these supraminor/submajor<br/>thirds:</p><p>   Bb3 -- +124 -- B3<br/>  (372)         (703)<br/>   F#3 -- -207 -- E3<br/>(703,331)       (703)<br/>   Eb3 -- +124 -- E3</p><p>Note that in this type of resolution, the supraminor third contracts<br/>to a unison while the submajor third expands to a fifth -- both<br/>resolutions involving melodic motion by an apotome or chromatic<br/>semitone of 3/29 octave or ~124.14 cents, here Eb3-E3 and Bb3-B3.<br/>The contrast between this cadential semitone and the usual one of 2/29<br/>octave (~82.76 cents) gives this type of resolution a distinctive<br/>melodic as well as vertical quality.</p><p>Incidentally, the border regions between this supraminor/submajor<br/>flavor of thirds or sixths and the near-5-based flavor of the<br/>immediate Pythagorean neighborhood or the more neutral flavor of the<br/>17-tET neighborhood can be quite fuzzy.</p><p>One rough and ready rule is that supraminor/submajor thirds should<br/>differ from ratios of 5:4 and 6:5 at least as much as the regular<br/>thirds of 12-tET do in the opposite direction: this places the border<br/>area at just below 29-tET along the spectrum of regular tunings.[2]</p><p>To distinguish supraminor/submajor from more &quot;neutral&quot; thirds, we<br/>might in one approach say that these thirds should differ in size by<br/>at least a syntonic comma of 81:80 (~21.51 cents), or possibly by the<br/>85:84 comma (~20.49 cents) distinguishing ratios of 5:4 and 6:5 from<br/>the simplest submajor/supraminor ratios of 21:17 and 17:14.</p><p>By either test, the submajor/supraminor thirds of the e-based tuning<br/>(fifths ~704.61 cents, ratio of whole-tone to diatonic semitone equal<br/>to Euler&apos;s e at ~2.71828) are getting close to a more neutral flavor:<br/>these thirds differ by about 21.68 cents.</p><p>----------<br/>3. Summary<br/>----------</p><p>The similarities between Pythagorean tuning and 29-tET may illustrate<br/>how a rather small amount of tempering (here ~1.49 cents for 29-tET<br/>fifths at ~703.45 cents) can make a dramatic musical difference for<br/>intervals derived from longer chains of fifths or fourths. At the same<br/>time, regular intervals built from shorter chains are indeed quite<br/>similar in the two tunings.</p><p>A very important lesson of intonational practice and theory is that<br/>mathematical parameters take on artistic meaning in specific musical<br/>contexts. This article has addressed specifically a Gothic/neo-Gothic<br/>type of style, where intervals such as thirds and sixths are unstable<br/>and typically quite active.</p><p>In such a setting, 29-tET augmented seconds and diminished fourths can<br/>serve as &quot;gentle&quot; variations on supraminor/submajor thirds most<br/>characteristically around 17:14 and 21:17. These intervals complement<br/>the regular 29-tET thirds of 10/29 octave (~413.79 cents or ~127:100)<br/>and 7/29 octave (~289.66 cents, ~13:11).</p><p>Especially dramatic and distinctive are progressions using the 41-cent<br/>diesis in place of a usual cadential semitone in resolving &quot;maximal&quot;<br/>seconds, thirds, and sixths (M2-4, M3-5, M6-8) a diesis wider than<br/>their regular counterparts, and &quot;minimal&quot; thirds and sevenths a diesis<br/>narrower (m3-1, m7-5).</p><p>This use of the diesis in a neo-Gothic setting seems to distinguish it<br/>from smaller intervals such as the Pythagorean or septimal comma; at<br/>the same time, it also has a rather different quality from more<br/>typical semitones of around 50-55 cents or larger, as with the regular<br/>diatonic semitone of 22-tET (~54.55 cents) or the diesis of the<br/>e-based tuning featured in &quot;metachromatic&quot; progressions (~55.28<br/>cents).</p><p>Having discussed some mathematical parameters of 29-tET, I would<br/>emphasize that such parameters take artistic shape in specific musical<br/>contexts.</p><p>For example, the 29-tET augmented second at around 331 cents might<br/>represent either a &quot;gentle&quot; 17:14 or a rather inaccurate 6:5; the same<br/>interval or tuning may often lend itself to such alternative<br/>interpretations.[3]</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. We can also define the Pythagorean comma or the diesis in 29-tET or<br/>meantone as the difference between 12 fifths up in a given tuning and<br/>7 pure octaves. For this measurement, a fifth of 700 cents (12n-tET)<br/>is the &quot;neutral&quot; reference point: regular tunings the same distance<br/>from this point in opposite directions will have dieses of the same<br/>magnitude. For example, 29-tET (~703.45 cents, +~3.45 cents) and<br/>1/4-comma meantone (~696.58 cents, -~3.42 cents) have dieses of almost<br/>identical sizes, but respectively positive and negative.</p><p>2. We can get a similar result by saying that thirds of this flavor<br/>should differ from each other by no more than the ratio of 459:448<br/>(~41.99 cents) between a 17:14 supraminor third and a usual<br/>Pythagorean minor third at 32:27 (~294.13 cents).</p><p>3. Similarly, the 400-cent third of 12n-tET might suggest either a<br/>somewhat &quot;subdued&quot; variation on the usual Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82<br/>cents), or a rather &quot;beatful&quot; version of a 5:4.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2001 8:04:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/30/01 8:34 PM, &quot;mschulter&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; [a whol&apos; lotta things an&apos; stuff...]</p><p>WOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</p><p>So much for one of the first questions I ever asked here,<br/>&quot;does *anyone* ever use 29?&quot;<br/>I give you 29 exclamation points.<br/>A simple &quot;uh huh...&quot;<br/>Neo-gothic eh?<br/>I know some people who would like that.</p><p>Margo, I thank you profusely for that most eloquent reply.<br/>It was very well organized and annotated.<br/>I&apos;ll have to study it at length.</p><p>Marc</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2001 8:44:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 5/30/01 8:34 PM, &quot;mschulter&quot; &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [a whol&apos; lotta things an&apos; stuff...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; WOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So much for one of the first questions I ever asked here,<br/>&gt; &quot;does *anyone* ever use 29?&quot;<br/>&gt; I give you 29 exclamation points.<br/>&gt; A simple &quot;uh huh...&quot;<br/>&gt; Neo-gothic eh?<br/>&gt; I know some people who would like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo, I thank you profusely for that most eloquent reply.<br/>&gt; It was very well organized and annotated.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll have to study it at length.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marc</p><p>Margo is great, isn&apos;t she?
