Take the ratio a/b where a &gt; b and a/b is either coprime or irrational. If [1/1, p/q,....a/b] represents the convergents of the continued fraction for a/b then the following identity holds:</p><p>f(t) = sin(2piat) + sin(2pibt) =</p><p>sin(2pi (p((a + b)/(p + q))t + ((aq - pb)/(p + q))t) +<br/>sin(2pi (q((a + b)/(p + q))t - ((aq - pb)/(p + q))t).</p><p>Since p and q are integers, then the original wave can be seen as the composite of two &apos;simpler&apos; waves, the pth and qth harmonics of fundamental GCD = (a + b)/(p + q), with an equal and opposite time-dependent phase shift in each component, R = (aq - pb)/(p + q). (Observe that the term (aq - pb) equals the determinant of each convergent).</p><p>The extrema (peaks) of each (p, q) follows what seems to be a new type of envelope (amplitude modulation):</p><p>+/- 2cos(2pi((aq - pb)/(p + q)]t +/- pi((p - q)(2k + 1)/(2(p + q))).</p><p>For the first term p/q = 1/1, this reduces to +/- 2cos(2pi(a - b)t) which suggests that this standard trigonometric identity now belongs to a larger class of identities. In fact, if there are N convergents, then their will be N - 1 such identities. Since irrationals have an infinite number of such convergents then there are an infinite number of identities. Also, for this first term the GCD becomes</p><p>p((a + b)/(p + q) = q((a + b)/(p + q) = (a + b)/2</p><p>which is just the average frequency.</p><p>Example, a/b = 81/64 gives convergents [1/1, 4/3, 5/4, 19/15, 81/64] which are the p/q&apos;s. This implies that the complex wave &apos;presents itself&apos; as a very badly tuned unison, a badly tuned fourth, a not so bad JI major third, a pretty good 19/15 and a perfect Pythagorean Maj third, or something like that. The GCD&apos;s are, respectively, 145/2 (average), 145/7, 145/9, 145/34 and 145/145 = 1 where it&apos;s seen that they are decreasing. Again, the concept of GCD = 1 now seems to be a special case. Of course the intervals are unison 1(145/7):1(145/7), fourth 3(145/7):4(145/7), and so on. Notice also that the determinants aq - pb in the remainder frequencies are becoming increasingly smaller, equalling zero when p/q = 81/64.</p><p>This is the maths. Thinking of this interval as a possible unison or fourth seems anti-intuitive but apparently the waves don&apos;t make this distinction. For music, it might be that some cut-off point exists in the remainder or something?? In any case, this at least gives this whole area of number theory some basis in the physics of waves.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=89467 href="#89467">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2010 8:46:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick,</p><p>   I&apos;m trying to follow this.

Of course I&apos;m aware that the &apos;form&apos; of the conclusion is tautological and the p, q in a = pg + R and b = qg + R will cancel out. However, this in itself is a necessary but insufficient condition. Not all other values of p and q are in the wave. Remember that I *deduced* them by finding t = (2k + 1)/2(a + b), solved for k to get k = (p + q). The period is the difference between this k and k = 0 giving T = (p + q)/(a + b).</p><p>Now, it might be that other values of p and q also occur in the wave besides the convergents. The mediants 62/49, 42/34 come to mind for the 81/64 (especially since (aq - pq) is Bezout&apos;s Identity). I&apos;ll test this when I get the time. However, this still does not mean that we can choose any p, q at random. As I said a few days ago, even though I &apos;know&apos; it&apos;s there I still can&apos;t find the key to a direct proof. I&apos;ve probably already done it without realising. If you think of one, please let me know. In the meantime, this doesn&apos;t stop me from working out some consequences.

Given a large-number frequency ratio a/b, or even letting a and b be irrational, find an expression for the &quot;virtual fundamental&quot; (VF) for a dyad with those frequencies.  Sometimes we &quot;know&quot; the answer, e.g. 500/400 has VF 100 (same as the GCD).  Other times it is not so easy e.g. 501/399 (the GCD is 3, surely the VF is not 3?).  In an offlist exchange (which I hope he will not mind me discussing) Carl said it is approximately 399/4, or 501/5.  Yes, but can&apos;t we find a single answer?  Ideally of course it would be *the* value that most closely captures what most listeners actually perceive; failing that, it should at least be a value that &quot;makes sense&quot;, e.g. varies continuously with a and b, is between 399/4 and 501/5, etc.  (I have mentioned another criterion in an earlier post, but I&apos;ll save that for later.)</p><p>The approach is to first find a smaller-number ratio p/q which approximates a/b as a ratio and thence derive approximate frequencies a&apos; and b&apos; near a and b, with a&apos;/b&apos; = p/q and thence the VF (GCD of p and q).  (Or, derive these things in a different order.)</p><p>BTW any statement of the results should say that the formula (with &quot;aq-bp&quot; and all that) is an identity, and that we are restricting ourselves to looking at certain values of p,q and explain why.  (The way you usually state it seems to imply that the identity holds for just those values of p, q.)  Having said that, that formula is not an essential part of the results, in my version of the problem stated above.</p><p>I am pretty certain that the best way to find p/q is to use a convergent or semi-convergent; it only remains to decide the balance between accuracy and small-numberedness in choosing p/q.  Other methods such as &quot;rounding (a+b)/(a-b)&quot; will probably turn out to be equivalent anyway (but perhaps I was the only one considering that).  Re the method of finding p/q in the graph of the combined waveform - I find this unconvincing.  I assume that the 64.pdf file is showing that each of the several envelopes representing different convergent frequencies does indeed touch the original combined waveform at certain peaks of the latter (but it misses many others!).  And I assume that this is what you mean by &quot;the convergents are all there&quot;?  But I don&apos;t believe that this is signficant - they wouldn&apos;t be heard, surely.  Particularly as the peaks are not even &quot;high peaks&quot; as they were in your original derivation of K.  The most convincing envelope is the first one - but to me this is just the difference tone.  (And furthermore the frequency of the last two is so low that we can hardly see anything happening in the brief window of time shown.)</p><p>&gt; ... Well I can confirm that the convergents are all there. ...<br/>&gt; Rick</p></div><h3><a id=89536 href="#89536">ðŸ”—</a>a_sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2010 12:30:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .... yeah there does some to be some connection....<br/>&gt; &gt;....attend the Pythagorean-Triple: 17^2 + 144^2 = 145^2 .....</p><p>Hi Rick,<br/>hence that Pythagorean triangle contains an angle phi<br/>with an superpartcular ratio for the cosine</p><p>cos(phi) = 144/145</p><p>sin(phi) = 17/145</p><p>tan(phi) = 17/144</p><p>asin(17/145) = ~0.11751164543145...radiant</p><p>or about</p><p>(180/pi)*asin(17/145) = ~6.73292132685961&deg;...degree out of 360&deg;</p><p>Formula in:<br/><a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Pythag/pythag.html">http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Pythag/pythag.html</a></p><p>    Note 75.23 Pythagorean triples Chris Evans Mathematical Gazette 75 (1991), page 317.</p><p>Can we find a formula for these triples?<br/>You will have noticed that the smallest sides are the odd numbers 3, 5, 7, 9,...

I have found all your criticisms very helpful. Likewise, I hope that my previous doubts about VP are taken in the same vain.</p><p>However, I can&apos;t see how your 501/399 example creates doubt about what I&apos;m proposing. Firstly, the ~ GCD would be (501 + 399)/(5 + 4) = 100 which *is* between 399/4 and 501/5. Of course this *is* the time between the first two largest maxima. Secondly, this example is in fact much closer to a &apos;pure&apos; 5/4 than the previous 81/64 because the envelope frequency is 2cos[2pit + pi/18] i.e. (aq - pb)/(p + q) = 9/9. This means that *the maxima are decreasing at a rate that is very small compared to the component frequencies*. Therefore, the maxima occur at almost precisely the same times as a 5/4 wave with GCD = 100 while the curve shape too is almost the same for long time periods.</p><p>As for all the other stuff about 5/4 being only one of the convergents and so on, well that&apos;s just me putting ideas/results out there. I still &apos;know&apos; that for an 81/64 that the 5/4 is the most reasonable, for a 32/27 it is a 6/5 etc... I&apos;m just trying to say it in a more mathematical way. It might be something as simple as the fact that 81/64 is closer to 80/64 = 5/4 than any other? Or it might be that (p + q)/(p - q) is closest to (a + b)/(a - b). I don&apos;t know yet. But I have tested it in many many graphic examples, some chosen at random, and it always checks out. Certainly enough &apos;probable cause&apos; to look into it in more depth. At any rate, we shouldn&apos;t let my own lack of mathematical skills get in the way.</p><p>Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks Steve,<br/>&gt; &gt; So far I&apos;ve been accused of either being completely confusing or completely obvious ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick,<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t thank me too much; yes I find the formulas readable, but sometimes I am confused by the words :-)  Also remember I said that I was not convinced by the way you derived the K=p+q by looking for peaks in the combined waveform (although the resulting formula looks reasonable).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is perhaps useful to reiterate what I think the aim is.

They represent the solution to the extrema of each curve. If we take the 5/4 for eg then we can think of this as a pure 5/4 wave with an amplitude modulation of frequency (aq - pb)/(p + q) = 4/9. Which brings me to the third point that it doesn&apos;t &quot;miss many other&quot; peaks.

If you substitute these values in all of the equations you&apos;ll see that they reduce to the standard trig ID 2sin((A + B)/2)cos((A - B)/2) suggesting that this now is just one instance of a more general formula. And yes, the last two are so slow that they wouldn&apos;t be heard (which is probably why they are not so relevant for tuning and which will likely be part of any &apos;selection&apos; process).

I then compared the &apos;pure&apos; JI wave to find the closest peaks and found that they always come out with T = K/(a + b) where K is *given*. For major thirds it is always K = 9, minor thirds K = 11 etc. *Why* this is is the million dollar question. My statements about Bezout, convergents etc...are all trying to answer this one (seemingly simple) question.</p><p>However, assuming that K is just given so we can see what happens (something might come out?), we can easily deduce p and q by dividing a and b by this frequency and taking it in quotient + remainder form.<br/>aK/(a + b) = p + (aq - pb)/(a + b),<br/>bK/(a + b) = q - (aq - pb)/(a + b),<br/>Adding gives K = (p + q). Multiplying the (a + b)/K back out gives us the identities.</p><p>Now, the fact that these identities work for any p and q is not the point. By p and q I mean those numbers that were deduced by knowing K. For major thirds it is 9 = 5 + 4, minor&apos;s 11 = 6 + 5. And graphing these values has revealed that they do look like pure JI waves with a modulated amplitude of (aq - pb)/(a + b). But I&apos;ve also since learnt that all of the convergents seem to be there, but not just any p, q chosen at random. The case K = 2 = 1 + 1 is the usual trig ID. Again, until I know why this is, what the selective process is etc..., the theory is not finished. But once I do then I can see in advance that the usual trig ID will become a special case. (Contrary to what&apos;s often said, tautologies are often used in proofs; &quot;this equals that, therefore...&quot;.

Well which is it Mike? Nor did I ever say that &quot;81/64 &quot;is really 5/4&quot;&quot;, but am simply pointing out that this branch of number theory now finds a basis in wave theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point I&apos;m making is that you are looking for &quot;the way&quot; to reduce<br/>&gt; 81/64 to 5/4 without taking the auditory system&apos;s setup into<br/>&gt; consideration and using just pure mathematics. It also seems like you<br/>&gt; want to do it without ever using Fourier analysis, although you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been using it the whole time anyway. Your motive is to proclaim that<br/>&gt; this problem is solved completely by &quot;wave theory&quot; or &quot;number theory,&quot;<br/>&gt; and that the missing fundamental phenomenon isn&apos;t a &quot;virtual&quot; pitch<br/>&gt; after all because it really exists in the wave. You will talk about<br/>&gt; how you did this without using Fourier analysis, despite the fact that<br/>&gt; referring to a complex waveform as &quot;81/64&quot; to begin with already<br/>&gt; involves Fourier analysis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And as I&apos;ve pointed out a number of times, which &quot;convergent&quot; the<br/>&gt; 81/64 will reduce to is going to be dependent on a lot of things (like<br/>&gt; musical context and what other notes are in the chord). I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt; 81/64 is going to be particularly limited to representing only its<br/>&gt; convergents either. You are trying to take a frequency-domain<br/>&gt; representation (81/64) and turn it into a mixed time-frequency<br/>&gt; representation (5/4 with time-varying amplitude and phase shifts).<br/>&gt; There are an infinite amount of ways to do this, and the human<br/>&gt; auditory system represents one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You also know as well as I that the 16.111 predicts the VP, which can be been confirmed by experience, and that we have excluded the difference tone 1/1 and the 19/15, which gives a VP that is too far removed from the initial freq&apos;s (at around 4). Once again, would you doubt that these two intervals are similar if they were used to back, say, harmonic entropy?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who doubts that 81/64 and 5/4 are perceptually similar? But we&apos;re in<br/>&gt; the realm of percept here.

After rereading Erlich&apos;s site, I remembered that it was this quote that initially peaked my interest: &quot;The pitch corresponding to the fundamental itself need not be physically present in the sound&quot;. Now I reasoned to myself, &apos;surely the ear must be responding to *something*, albeit badly&apos;. As you know, I&apos;ve always thought it illogical to define frequency = sine wave when the definition of GCD is the more general. IOW my conjecture was that when we detune harmonics, a &apos;residual&apos; of the GCD remained in the wave. This point at least I think I have proved. Nor do I think it contradicts HE mathematically in any way, only perhaps in the possible explanation of the results.</p><p>As I just said to Carl and Steve, and following their suggestion, instead of starting with some &apos;large numbered&apos; interval a/b and trying (badly) to deduce a small numbered p/q, begin with our small p/q and detune, say, the p. Reinterpreting the results I&apos;ve got so-far, perhaps the easiest way to do this is to take ~ GCD = (p*S + q)/(p + q) where S is the ratio representing the extent of the detuning. For eg, if p/q = 5/4 then we might take S = 81/80, the &quot;whatsit? comma&quot;.</p><p>Now, the conditions for choosing S seems tailor-made for HE. For eg, the determinant aq - pb now becomes pSq - pq = pq(S - 1). By following through the logic of the Farey Series, where the distances between mediants around the simple numbers are greater but cluster around the complex intervals, we should arrive at a similar model to Paul&apos;s. The only difference now would be that a wave corresponds to each dyad point; the further the distance from p/q, the further is the ~ GCD from the original. A good place to start might be to select S such that the determinant is 1?</p><p>Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sat, May 29, 2010 at 10:44 AM, martinsj013 &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rick,<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But you&apos;ve not exactly understood what the graphs represent.

But are you really saying that any of this is significant? Just because every peak is hit by one or another of the envelopes in the set, this means the frequencies &quot;are there&quot;? Can this be perceived by the listener?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ^ This.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; * Similarly, I don&apos;t understand the &quot;refresh&quot; idea. If you find two peaks (e.g.) 1ms apart, and if this is &quot;refreshed&quot; every 1ms, I feel sure that would be straightforwardly perceived. But if instead it is refreshed every (e.g.) 1.1ms, then whatever is perceived I doubt will have period 1ms or 1.1ms but something else. Are you even able to say that the &quot;refresh&quot; occurs regularly?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s my exact point. The &quot;refresh&quot; has to do with how the auditory<br/>&gt; system is set up. I believe from reading Paul&apos;s HE the analogous<br/>&gt; parameter is the &quot;s&quot; free parameter (if I&apos;m doing the DSP math in my<br/>&gt; head right), and he says the auditory system can change it dynamically<br/>&gt; depending on the stimulus (I.E. speech will have a faster &quot;refresh&quot;<br/>&gt; than a long droning chord or something).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; * I have never said that the (a+b)/(p+q) formula is unconvincing, just the way you derived it. Noted that you don&apos;t claim to have a proof, indeed you are hoping someone here will help find one. The presence in the graph of &quot;significant peaks early on at the expected values&quot;, the idea of &quot;refresh&quot;, and the set of envelopes, aren&apos;t leading me towards a proof :-(. I wonder if Mike B has any thoughts on these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think he may have found something interesting whereby the sinusoid<br/>&gt; with the frequency equaling the GCD of the convergents intersect with<br/>&gt; the wave at different regular points (how&apos;s that for a mouthful). Why<br/>&gt; this is, I&apos;m not sure. Probably has something to do with how the<br/>&gt; convergents are derived.

Since S is arbitrary, the key thing this extracts is the Tenney height of p/q.</p></div><h3><a id=89766 href="#89766">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2010 11:10:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What do these adjectives &quot;horror&quot; and &quot;trawl&quot; imply?

If we take two pianos (or digitally modelled pianos) then the possibility of a *third* fundamental/near fundamental arises as a feature of superposition. This possibility led me to reason that something akin to the tonic could be present in the wave without an instrument being assigned to play that particular note.</p><p>Rick</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Partials and dyads are different (the &quot;extrapolation&quot; I mentioned)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but virtual pitch and virtual fundamental aren&apos;t.  -C.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl, thanks.

I was just working on something very similar myself (and my bones tell me this is going to be the right method). Given ak/(a + b) = p + r/(a + b), bk/(a + b) = q -/+ r/(a + b), r = aq - pb, we arrive at p and q simply by *rounding off*. So for 81/64 we get<br/>k = 1, (p , q) = (1, 0),<br/>k = 2, (p , q) = (1, 1),<br/>k = 3, (p , q) = (2, 1),<br/>k = 4, (p , q) = (2, 2),<br/>k = 5, (p , q) = (3, 2),<br/>k = 6, (p , q) = (3, 3),<br/>k = 7, (p , q) = (4, 3),<br/>k = 8, (p , q) = (4, 4),<br/>k = 9, (p , q) = (5, 4),...<br/>(p , q) = (1, 1) gives (a + b)/(p + q) = (a + b)/2, modulated freq r/(p + q) = (a - b)/2 which is just the usual beat frequency. We also see that all the convergents are there which explains why they worked.</p><p>But there are other things going on which eliminate most from the list. Even numbers up to k = 20 give p = q and since k = p + q this gives (a + b)/(p + q) = (a + b)/k ( = even) and r/(p + q) = (a - b) which are just cycles of the usual beat frequency.</p><p>Once I clean this up I should then begin to see why the 5/4 stands out above all other options, 3/2, 4/3 etc...Perhaps &apos;r &gt; some value&apos; (similar to Carl&apos;s basic idea) or the mod period is too long compared with the originals, and so on? Getting there slowly but surely.</p><p>Rick</p></div>
