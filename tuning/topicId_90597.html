They are similar to my NPJ scale and one of yours has a 15/14 which you don&apos;t see too often. In both of your scales you use a 7/4 but I suspect that using a 9/5 instead would yield more good intervals (although 7/4 seems stronger than 9/5). As I said before a huge criterion for me, when building a scale, was symmetry. I think it is impossible to have a 12 key scale where 1/1 and 2/1 have equal strength unless you use sqrt(2) as the tritone. With NPJ 1/1 and 3/2 can be used as tonics with equal strength. 1/1 is better for music that ascends from and then descends to 1/1. 3/2 is better for music that descends from and then ascends to 3/2. With NPJ the notes going up from 1/1 are the exact mirror image of the notes going down from 3/2. What do you think of this symmetry business?</p><p>John.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2010 12:22:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What do you think of this symmetry business?</p><p>I don&apos;t see why it is important, and of course it&apos;s impossible to produce a JI scale with sqrt(2) in it, though you can get arbitrarily close.</p><p>The symmetrical pentatonic, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 2 is not notably more successul than non-symmetrical versions. However, if you start the highschool scale generation process from it (or equivalently, from 3/2, 2 or 4/3, 3/2, 2) you can produce more symmetrical alternatives. 6/5 has a triangular denominator, and factors as 9/8 * 16/15, and we could go to either 9/8, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 16/9, 2 or 16/15, 6/5, 4/3, 5/3, 15/8, 2 as the next step. Neither scale is known to the Scala archives, and they are not Fokker blocks, though their symmetry makes for some cute lattice diagram patterns. We now have the same kind of choices breaking apart 9/8 and 10/9 as before, and will not be able to preserve strict symmetry. However, we can break uo 10/9, giving us a 5-limit nine-note scale, obtaining 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 16/9, 2 and 16/15, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 15/8, 2. We now do have Fokker blocks; the first scale turned up in my survey as &quot;mavlim1&quot;:</p><p>! mavlim1.scl<br/>!<br/>First 27/25&amp;135/128 scale<br/> 9<br/>!<br/> 9/8<br/> 6/5<br/> 5/4<br/> 4/3<br/> 3/2<br/> 8/5<br/> 5/3<br/> 16/9<br/> 2/1</p><p>and the second as &quot;mavdie1&quot;:</p><p>! mavdie1.scl<br/>First 128/125&amp;135/128 scale = Dwarf(&lt;19 14 21|) = efg3355<br/>9<br/>!<br/>16/15<br/>6/5<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>8/5<br/>5/3<br/>15/8<br/>2</p><p>It&apos;s also a dwarf scale and an Euler genus.</p><p>I can&apos;t continue the highschool process with 9/8 and get symmetrical scales, but for mavdie1 in particular it seems worth looking at what we do get. Going once again for the obvious best choices, I get the following scale and its inversion:</p><p>! 12highschool3.scl<br/>Third 12-note Highschool scale<br/>12<br/>!<br/>16/15<br/>8/7<br/>6/5<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>7/5<br/>3/2<br/>8/5<br/>5/3<br/>7/4<br/>15/8<br/>2</p><p>The inversion simply replaces 7/5 with 10/7. This scale is very close to the Hahn reduction of a 12-note 7-limit epimorphic scale, which is where the least complex interval in terms of the Hahn metric is chosen:</p><p>! hahn12.scl<br/>Hahn-reduced 12 note scale<br/>12<br/>!<br/>15/14<br/>8/7<br/>6/5<br/>5/4<br/>4/3<br/>7/5<br/>3/2<br/>8/5<br/>5/3<br/>7/4<br/>15/8<br/>2</p><p>This also has steps which are superparticular and have square or triangular numerators.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2010 11:48:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Eventually this thign breaks down (for on thing, 36 is both square and triangular) but it hasn&apos;t yet, so let&apos;s go to the next step.
