Similarly, my &quot;Zalzalian 12&quot; from the O3<br/>temperament has two of these &quot;comma pairs&quot; which often allow a<br/>choice of shadings for Near Eastern maqam/dastgah music, and also<br/>open some special possibilities for gamelan!</p><p>With great humility, please let me add that my task in this<br/>&quot;Ethno Extra&quot; is much less exacting than that faced by Jacques in<br/>his truly ingenious Buzurg tuning. He combines and integrates two<br/>distinct types of slendro yielding a rich banquet of gamelan<br/>flavors including some intervals around 241 and 257 cents, a<br/>territory not explored in my more constrained tuning. Also, he<br/>provides alternatives such as 14/13 and 13/12 above the same<br/>note, a feature not supported in this variation.</p><p>Before offering a Scala file of the &quot;Zalzalian 12&quot; tuning and<br/>giving a quick tour, I should say a word about the larger 24-note<br/>O3 tuning and also explain the Buzurg mode as described by two<br/>theorists from the era of around 1250-1300, Safi al-Din al-Urmawi<br/>and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi.</p><p>------------------------------<br/>1. What is the O3 temperament?<br/>------------------------------</p><p>Since this is not only the debut of my &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; but also of<br/>the O3 temperament on the Tuning list, I should briefly explain<br/>what this 24-note tuning system is and how it came out.</p><p>The name &quot;O3&quot; is the chemical symbol for ozone, and alludes to an<br/>important event during the Ethno2 contest: the period of &quot;Ozan<br/>depletion&quot; brought about as Ozan Yarman labored to produce his<br/>peerless interpretations of Ottoman music revivifying this<br/>tradition in the cultural and technological world of the 21st<br/>century. Such a labor was necessarily taxing, and resulted in a<br/>depletion of his ability promptly to respond to tuning<br/>discussions on this list.</p><p>This momentary crisis of Ozan depletion led me to focus on the<br/>idea of a 24-note tempered system optimizing the large Zalzalian<br/>or neutral third at 26/21 (370 cents) which he mentioned was one<br/>historical flavor for an Ottoman Rast. More generally, it was my<br/>goal to optimize all four of the Zalzalian or middle second steps<br/>discussed by medieval Islamic theorists such as Safi al-Din, and<br/>also by Ozan, the 14:13, 13:12: 12:11, and 11:10.</p><p>Thus the name &quot;O3&quot; not only serves as the symbol for ozone, but<br/>stands for Ozan, Ottoman, and Optimize -- this last word carrying<br/>the humble meaning of an always open goal and striving with many<br/>possible solutions, notably including George Secor&apos;s HTT-29, to<br/>which this temperament, like the rather similar Peppermint, is<br/>much indebted (and the latter, of course, also to Keenan Pepper<br/>and Erv Wilson for defining the basic regular Wilson/Pepper<br/>tuning!).</p><p>To emphasize the humorous aspects of this temperament before<br/>sharing a few technical details for the curious, I should add<br/>that the name &quot;O3&quot; is also a kind of open question for Ozan and<br/>others to answer. Ozone is notably a life-protecting element when<br/>present at its natural location in the upper atmosphere, but a<br/>harmful one when it when makes an unwelcome appearance in the<br/>lower atmosphere as a component of urban smog. Thus the open<br/>question: is O3 a stratospheric flight to a pleasant layer of<br/>intonation for Ottoman music, or a pollution of the pure<br/>Istanbuline airs?</p><p>If it were a &quot;smoothcoated&quot; or simple planar (i.e. rank 3)<br/>temperament, O3 could be defined by three simple generators. The<br/>period is the 2:1 octave. The regular fifth generating each of<br/>the two 12-note chains is (84/11)^(1/5), that is, the fifth at<br/>about 703.893 cents (1.938 cents wide) that produces a regular<br/>diatonic semitone or limma at a just 22/21 (80.537 cents). The<br/>third generator, the &quot;artificial diesis&quot; or distance between<br/>the two 12-note (Eb-G#) chains, is equal to a pure 7/4 (968.825<br/>cents) less the regular major sixth of this tuning at about<br/>911.678 cents, or 57.148 cents.</p><p>As a roughcoated planar temperament, however, O3 very slightly<br/>nuances this theoretical scheme by mapping to 1024-EDO in a way<br/>so that each 22:21 diatonic semitone is about 0.322 cents wide,<br/>and thus an 11:10 built from two such semitones is narrow by<br/>about 3.286 cents, comparable to the 3.247-cent tolerance<br/>standard of Secor&apos;s HTT-29. By comparison, 11:10 is 3.930 cents narrow in a smoothcoated (theoretical planar) version of O3, or<br/>3.466 cents in a 104-EDO version worthy of mention since a<br/>discussion of 104-EDO on this list focused my attention on almost<br/>exactly the right size of fifth for what became the O3 system.</p><p>Here is O3 in its roughcoated 1024-EDO version:</p><p>! O3-24.scl<br/>!<br/>O3 or &quot;Ozone&quot; (24): just 22/21 limma, 7/4, 11/6 (1024-EDO version)<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 57.42188<br/> 126.56250<br/> 183.98438<br/> 207.42188<br/> 264.84376<br/> 288.28125<br/> 345.70313<br/> 414.84375<br/> 472.26563<br/> 495.70312<br/> 553.12500<br/> 622.26563<br/> 679.68751<br/> 703.12500<br/> 760.54688<br/> 830.85937<br/> 888.28125<br/> 911.71875<br/> 969.14063<br/> 992.57813<br/> 1050.00001<br/> 1119.14063<br/> 1176.56251<br/> 2/1</p><p>Having explained O3, with a well-merited bow to Ozan Yarman and<br/>George Secor, I should reassure readers that the 12-note or other<br/>&quot;Ethno Extras&quot; I present should speak for themselves without any<br/>need to understand the basis of this underlaying 24-note system.<br/>Rather, with s-n-buzurg and the other Ethno2 tunings as sterling<br/>examples, each Ethno Extra should be a world within itself.</p><p>------------------<br/>2. What is Buzurg?<br/>------------------</p><p>While both Jacques and I may speak of a Buzurg &quot;mode,&quot; suggesting<br/>some kind of scheme covering the range of an octave or more,<br/>strictly speaking the Buzurg of Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din is a<br/>division of the 3:2 fifth, with one form being the following.</p><p>   1/1   14/13     16/13    4/3    56/39    3/2<br/>    0     128       359     498     626     702<br/>     14:13     8:7     13:12   14:13  117:112<br/>      128      231      139     128     76</p><p>A related scheme, also suggested in these medieval sources, uses<br/>mostly the same steps (14:13, 13:12, 8:7), but with a different<br/>ordering:</p><p>   1/1    13/12     26/21    4/3    13/9     3/2<br/>    0      139       359     498     637     702<br/>     13:12      8:7     14:13   13:12   27:26<br/>      139       231      128     128     65</p><p>As it happens, while O3 as a whole supports both types, the<br/>Zalzalian 12 set supports only the first variety with a lower<br/>tetrachrod of 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3.</p><p>If we wish to expand the Buzurg 3:2 division to a mode in the<br/>sense of an octave division, one simple approach is to add a<br/>second tetrachord at the 3/2 symmetrical with that at the 1/1.<br/>Here we follow the first type of Buzurg, where the tetrachord is<br/>14:13-8:7-13:12 or 128-231-139 cents:</p><p> |----------------------|              |-------------------|<br/>1/1   14/13   16/13    4/3    56/39   3/2   21/13  24/13  2/1<br/> 0     128     359     498     626    702    830   1061  1200<br/>  14:13    8:7    13:12   14:13 117:112  14:13  8:7  13:12<br/>   128     231     139     128     76     128   231   139</p><p>As we shall see, some other types of upper tetrachords also seem<br/>congenial to Buzurg, and really &quot;making a maqam out of it&quot; calls<br/>for a melodic path or procedure often involving inflections or<br/>modulations. However, this concept of a &quot;Buzurg mode&quot; is one<br/>starting point.</p><p>In the Zalzalian 12 set, as it happens, such a Buzurg mode does<br/>not appear on the 1/1 (as it does in s-n-buzurg.scl), but rather<br/>on the steps at 346 cents (11/9 or 39/32) and 843 cents (13/8).</p><p>Thus before getting to our first Buzurg mode, we&apos;ll encounter<br/>some other Near Eastern and gamelan modes; but I should assure<br/>Buzurg lovers that we will get there!</p><p>------------------------------------<br/>3.

The 21/16 step plays a premier role in making some<br/>of these progressions and shadings possible, for example in this<br/>cadence featuring a small Zalzalian or neutral third at 334 cents<br/>which expands to a fifth:</p><p>         843 (13/8)   969 (7/4)  1200 (2/1)<br/>         472 (21/16)              704 (3/2)<br/>         138 (13/12)               0  (1/1)</p><p>Here the opening sonority of 0-334-704 might represent 14:17:21,<br/>with the highest voice then moving up by a 127-cent step so that<br/>the sonority becomes 0-334-831, with 52:63:84 as one JI reading<br/>suggested by the near-pure 21:13 small neutral sixth not far from<br/>the intriguing ratio of Phi (833.090 cents). Then, the small<br/>neutral neutral third and sixth expand to fifth and octave in a<br/>manner recalling the classic European polyphony practiced in the<br/>era of Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din -- or more precisely as it<br/>might have been practiced if the Zalzalian intervals of these and<br/>other Islamic theorists had been part of its vocabulary!</p><p>Another possibility is a variation on Jacques Dudon&apos;s beautiful<br/>Ibina, 1/1-13/12-11/9-4/3-3/2-13/8-16/9-2/1. The lower tetrachord<br/>is of the Mohajira type with Z-T-Z where &quot;Z&quot; is a Zalzalian or<br/>neutral second and &quot;T&quot; and regular major second or tone, while<br/>the upper tetrachord on the 3/2 is a form of Shur, Turkish<br/>Ushshaq, or Arab Bayyati, with Z-Z-T, two Zalzalian steps<br/>followed by a tone. Here both the 4/3 fourth and 16/9 minor<br/>seventh are lowered by a comma to 21/16 and 7/4.</p><p>     &quot;Narrow Moha&quot;           Shur/Bayyati<br/>   |----------------|     |----------------|<br/>   0   138   346   472   704   843  969  1200<br/>  1/1 13/12  11/9 21/16  3/2  13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>    138   207   127   232   138   127   231</p><p>Here, in a curious way, the lower Mohajira (&quot;Moha&quot; for short)<br/>variant tetrachord introduces two of the steps of Buzurg: a lower<br/>138-cent step representing 13:12, and an upper 127-cent step<br/>representing 14:13. The middle step, however, is a comma narrower<br/>than Buzurg&apos;s usual 8:7 (231 cents), at 207 cents or a near-9:8<br/>(also a near-44:39), so that the fourth is compressed from a<br/>usual rounded 496 or 497 cents in this temperament to 472 cents,<br/>or in JI terms from 4/3 to 21/16.</p><p>While I am not aware of any discussion of these specific altered<br/>modes in medieval or modern Near Eastern theory, I mention them<br/>in keeping with the adventurous xenharmonic spirit of Ethno, and<br/>also the wise adage that one should not spurn what the equations<br/>or tuning parameters generously cast at one&apos;s feet. In fact, as I<br/>relate above, the Shur with 21/16 in place of 4/3 proves both<br/>melodically apt and contrapuntally delightful when considered as<br/>a mode in its own right, as well as resembling the kind of<br/>pattern I often fall into when improvising in a septimal Shur or<br/>Arab Bayyati where a usual 4/3 step is the norm but the<br/>progression of the _sayr_ or development may lead at some points<br/>to the lowering of this step by a comma. Likewise, the Ibina-like<br/>mode with lowered steps at 21/16 and 7/4, although not following<br/>the original scheme of differential coherence (-c), nevertheless<br/>presents fruitful possibilities as a septimal variation on the<br/>Mohajira/Ibina theme.</p><p>(Conclusion of Part 1)</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=91549 href="#91549">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2010 4:33:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,<br/>I started to reply to your post :<br/>ETHNO EXTRAS: Zalzalian 12 (Pt. 1) Intro, Rotation 0<br/>when I noticed you already gave many advised comments on our differents versions of possible Buzurg temperaments, a subject which inspired both of us apparently at the very same moment !<br/>I should be also working on my next concert, so my excuses if I am only doing very fast - my excuses also to Andy who sent many answers to our previous exchanges that interests me a lot, but to which I could not find the time to reply.<br/>My reflexions arrive to the same conclusions as yours, basically that the two propositions may look different, but are in fact only half-different.<br/>To show this let me start from your precious scales citations from Safi-Al-Din and Qutb al-Din :</p><p>&gt; While both Jacques and I may speak of a Buzurg &quot;mode,&quot; suggesting<br/>&gt; some kind of scheme covering the range of an octave or more,<br/>&gt; strictly speaking the Buzurg of Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din is a<br/>&gt; division of the 3:2 fifth, with one form being the following.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 14/13 16/13 4/3 56/39 3/2<br/>&gt; 0 128 359 498 626 702<br/>&gt; 14:13 8:7 13:12 14:13 117:112<br/>&gt; 128 231 139 128 76<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A related scheme, also suggested in these medieval sources, uses<br/>&gt; mostly the same steps (14:13, 13:12, 8:7), but with a different<br/>&gt; ordering:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 13/12 26/21 4/3 13/9 3/2<br/>&gt; 0 139 359 498 637 702<br/>&gt; 13:12 8:7 14:13 13:12 27:26<br/>&gt; 139 231 128 128 65</p><p>Here we find two versions for a neutral third over 1/1 : 16/13 and 26/21.<br/>Without knowing it, a &quot;noble mediant&quot; of those two intervals is very much what I did between those two, when considering they belong to the same series :<br/>21 : 26 : 32...<br/>And tempering the difference between 16/13 and 26/21, over-present in Buzurg JI scales, or 169/168, was very precisely from where my idea came.<br/>Therefore it was very logical to complete the series to :<br/>17 : 21 : 26 : 32 : 39 : 48 : 59 : 73 : 90 ...<br/>where 90 - 73 = 17 gives the key of the recurrence.<br/>And where again the difference between 21/17 and 32/26, or 273/272 can be tempered as well, etc.<br/>Then Safi-Al-Din gives a very interesting clue with that strange interval after 4/3,  56/39 :<br/>I note that 56/39 and 23/16 (in between the two versions) only differ by 897/896 : another one I tempered.<br/>(we also find it between 16/13 and 69/56, that you mention)<br/>And when you divide 23/1 in 15 steps, you find again the same generator - this means that the path to that precise note<br/>(56/39) contains the whole scale :<br/>= 0, 7, 1, 8, 15  of those generators giving the first pentachord, also defining the fifth symmetrically, by -8 generators.</p><p>Now correct Buzurg-tempered zalzals can define a wide variety of fifths, and why not one slightly extended one as you suggested, that&apos;s why I would say our two ideas have no contradiction.<br/>In fact, the recurrent sequence  4x^4 = x + 8  I gave in my list as a central one, generates very precisely such a fifth, with 703.837171 c.<br/>Inversely, to find exactly your fifth of 703.893 c. a generator of 1,232577031 would be needed, that would find many good approximations in the series of that fractal (one is 53/43 with 1,23255814...).<br/>Here is one that starts by this 53/43 interval :<br/>516 : 636 : 784 : 966 : 1191 : 1468 : &gt;3619 &gt; 8919 &gt; 2749 &gt;27107 ...<br/>where 8*516/2749 = 1.501637 = 703.843277 c.</p><p>Then all your following remarks are very right too !<br/>many thanks,<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>&gt;     (Jacques) :<br/>&gt; &gt; 6) More surprising, I found some holes in the linear<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament list, at places where musical systems, even<br/>&gt; &gt; used in traditional music, have galaxies of fractal<br/>&gt; &gt; solutions : the &quot;Buzurg&quot; zone is one of these, that would<br/>&gt; &gt; generate very musical scales : at least Margo Schulter will<br/>&gt; &gt; not contradict me on that point (Margo, I have not read<br/>&gt; &gt; your last article on Buzurg yet : will see if we find some<br/>&gt; &gt; concordances on the subject !).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Jacques,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me agree that the Buzurg zone is a wonderful place for<br/>&gt; fractal solutions -- and also for the kinds of regular or planar<br/>&gt; temperaments that I often use. Of course, I will be very<br/>&gt; interested to read any comments you have on my Buzurg article,<br/>&gt; which is proving far longer than I planned on, for better or<br/>&gt; worse, maybe because the &quot;Zalzalian 12&quot; set has caused me to<br/>&gt; focus on a variety of modes in the different rotations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, your discussion below of a Buzurg generator gave me an<br/>&gt; idea for an experiment to show that -c tunings and regular or<br/>&gt; planar temperaments can often lead to musically congenial,<br/>&gt; although distinct, results, with both approaches lending<br/>&gt; themselves to maqam/dastgah music. One of the goals of my &quot;Ethno<br/>&gt; Extras&quot; is indeed to seek out such concordances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And here I would add that a -c tuning like your Aulos/Soria seems<br/>&gt; to me closer to the spirit of an irregular Persian tar fretting,<br/>&gt; for example, than a regular or even planar temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The only reason I see for that omission in the temperament list<br/>&gt; &gt; is that the Buzurg generator before anything else conciliates 7<br/>&gt; &gt; and 13, and will not come to harmonics 3, 5 and 11 before<br/>&gt; &gt; longer cycles, therefore it is not on a list that privilegiates<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments with full 3, 5, 7 solutions and after.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, the situation with the Buzurg generator may be like<br/>&gt; that with my regular &quot;e-based&quot; temperament (704.607c), or my<br/>&gt; Peppermint planar temperament based on the regular Wilson/Pepper<br/>&gt; noble fifth temperament (704.096c) with a distance between the<br/>&gt; 12-note chains or &quot;ribbons&quot; of 58.680c. These systems, like your<br/>&gt; Buzurg, support harmonics 7 and 13 -- and also here 3 and 11 --<br/>&gt; but not 5, at least within the intended size of 24 notes. We<br/>&gt; might indeed say that such temperaments, like your Buzurg,<br/>&gt; neither privilege nor are privileged by the usual &quot;regular<br/>&gt; mapping&quot; approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here is a 23-limit mapping, showing main MOS at 10, 43 , 53,<br/>&gt; &gt; that would be resolved by a &quot;Buzurg&quot; neutral third of 16<br/>&gt; &gt; unequal steps of 53 steps in one octave (around 362 cents) :<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;0, -8, 11, 6, 28, -1, -3, 24, 15] (note that the 23rd<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic, one of the best centered, would be reached precisely<br/>&gt; &gt; by 15 generators, suggesting a useful and efficient target<br/>&gt; &gt; generator with 1.2324856 or 361.884956 c.) note also that a<br/>&gt; &gt; pure harmonic 3 will be attained with a generator of<br/>&gt; &gt; 362.255625c.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your generators syggested an experiment: I used Scala to define a<br/>&gt; regular temperament with 361.884956c as the diminished fourth<br/>&gt; (e.g. G#-C) from eight fifths down or fourths up. Of course, this<br/>&gt; method is very different from using this large neutral third of<br/>&gt; Buzurg as itself the generator, and different again from<br/>&gt; a -c system using a series including a 69/56 third (361.402c),<br/>&gt; for example, maybe somewhat in the manner of the Ibina tuning<br/>&gt; (or the very slightly larger 53/43 you mention below)!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fifth is 704.76438 cents, almost identical to 63-EDO, and<br/>&gt; actually a bit closer to the point where the apotome is equal to<br/>&gt; precisely half of 7/6, which thus is virtually pure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your generator, interestingly, produces a fifth (from 8<br/>&gt; generators down) of 704.920 cents, with 16 in a 24-note tuning.<br/>&gt; And we get lots of hemifourths at 247.540 cents not present in my<br/>&gt; regular temperament! And you have 8 locations with symmetrical<br/>&gt; Buzurg tetrachords, (0-133-362-495-705-838-1066-1200). one of<br/>&gt; which also includes a 23/16 step (56/39 or 13/9 in medieval JI<br/>&gt; versions).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is a Buzurg mode in the regular 704.764c temperament with<br/>&gt; the upper tetrachord like the lower:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! rbuzurg-buzurg8_Cup.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Buzurg pentachord plus 133-229-133 tetrachord at ~3/2<br/>&gt; 8<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 133.35066<br/>&gt; 361.88496<br/>&gt; 495.23562<br/>&gt; 628.58628<br/>&gt; 704.76438<br/>&gt; 838.11504<br/>&gt; 1066.64934<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and here is Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi&apos;s Buzurg-Hijaz combination:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! rbuzurg-buzurg_hijaz_Cup.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi&apos;s Buzurg plus upper Hijaz (JI 12:11-7:6-22:21)<br/>&gt; 8<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; 133.35066<br/>&gt; 361.88496<br/>&gt; 495.23562<br/>&gt; 628.58628<br/>&gt; 704.76438<br/>&gt; 857.12058<br/>&gt; 1123.82190<br/>&gt; 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you remark, in this temperament as in your &quot;buzurg&quot; mapping,<br/>&gt; we get a ~23/16 step as a variation on the 56/39 of Safi al-Din<br/>&gt; al-Urmawi and Qutb al-Din.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, we could also explore this territory with a -c tuning<br/>&gt; maybe something like Soria 17 + 2 in the A version with the<br/>&gt; larger comma, where Buzurg or Buzurg-Rast modes turn up at a<br/>&gt; couple of locations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Many practical fractals would qualify as Buzurgs,<br/>&gt; &gt; such as :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 7x^2 = 7x + 2 &gt; 1,23192505471 &gt; 361,09738964 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4x^7 = 16 + x &gt; 1,2320003029 &gt; 361,2031329 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4x^2 = 11 - 4x &gt; 1,2320508076 &gt; 361,2741 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; x^8 = x^7 + 1 &gt; 1,2320546314 &gt; 361,2794748 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; x^2 = 20 - 15x &gt; 1,2321245983 &gt; 361,37778668556 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; 3x^2 = 11x - 9 &gt; 1,2324081208 &gt; 361,77611271646 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4x^4 = 8 + x &gt; 1.23258192464 &gt; 362,020247741 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2x^5 = 8 - x^4 &gt; 1,2326439928 &gt; 362,107458 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; 8x^5 = 24 - x &gt; 1,2326632514 &gt; 362,1344722332 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2x^8 = 15 - x^7 &gt; 1,2328237225 &gt; 362,359833742 c.<br/>&gt; &gt; x^2 = 28x - 33 &gt; 1,2328546652 &gt; 362,403288 c.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The simplest series are generated by x^8 = x^7 + 1, such as :<br/>&gt; &gt; 17 21 26 32 39 48 59 73 90 111 137 169 208 256 315 388 478...<br/>&gt; &gt; (differentials 4 5 6 7 9 11 14 17 21 26 32 39 48 59 73 90...)<br/>&gt; &gt; 4x^4 = 8 + x converges to a generator by coincidence also<br/>&gt; &gt; approximated by the main MOS ratio : 53/43...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed this series includes many of the intervals based on<br/>&gt; harmonics 3-7-11-13 that I seek out in regular or planar<br/>&gt; temperaments, and I think would be a &quot;charmed attractor&quot; to<br/>&gt; anyone with a passion for these intervals. You may recall<br/>&gt; explaining to me, when I proposed a sequence for &quot;Mohajira,&quot;<br/>&gt; that what I was seeking was actually this &quot;Buzurg 8&quot; series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/89511">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/89511</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A curious question is whether 69/56, like 53/43, might make an<br/>&gt; interesting generator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One last thought : 43 + 53 = 96 steps/octave, a division I<br/>&gt; &gt; know to be dear to Shaahin Mohajeri, features of course also<br/>&gt; &gt; a very good Buzurg third of 13 + 16 = 29 steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shaahin&apos;s creative use of 96-EDO, and your comment, make me take<br/>&gt; note now that indeed this equal temperament has lots of support<br/>&gt; for some traditional Persian modes.

And Ozan might have me mention the Turkish or Syrian<br/>interval of 16 commas (e.g. 16/53 octave) at 362.264 cents, or the<br/>almost identical 24 yarmans in the 79/80-MOS of 159-EDO (actually with<br/>minute variations in step sizes from 159-EDO in some versions).</p><p>In contrast, Peppermint (rank 3) has 367.235 cents, either 21/17 or<br/>26/21 (tempering 442/441); and 357.703, not too far from 16/13 but<br/>actually closer to 59/48, which also appears in your series and is, of<br/>course, part of the famous Mohajira variety with 48:52:59:64.</p><p>&gt;  Then Safi-Al-Din gives a very interesting clue with that strange<br/>&gt;  interval after 4/3, 56/39 : I note that 56/39 and 23/16 (in between<br/>&gt;  the two versions) only differ by 897/896 : another one I tempered.<br/>&gt;  (we also find it between 16/13 and 69/56, that you mention)</p><p>Yes, when it comes to these commas, we seem to be speaking the same<br/>basic language. What I noticed in e-based/Euler is that the best<br/>approximation of the medieval 56/39 (14/13 plus 4/3) was 627.641<br/>cents, or 0.633 cents narrow of 23/16.</p><p>&gt;  And when you divide 23/1 in 15 steps, you find again the same<br/>&gt;  generator - this means that the path to that precise note (56/39)<br/>&gt;  contains the whole scale :</p><p>&gt;  = 0, 7, 1, 8, 15 of those generators giving the first pentachord,<br/>&gt;  also defining the fifth symmetrically, by -8 generators.</p><p>&gt;  Now correct Buzurg-tempered zalzals can define a wide variety of<br/>&gt;  fifths, and why not one slightly extended one as you suggested,<br/>&gt;  that&apos;s why I would say our two ideas have no contradiction.</p><p>Yes, we agree that these are two roads to the same musical region.</p><p>&gt;  In fact, the recurrent sequence 4x^4 = x + 8 I gave in my list as a<br/>&gt;  central one, generates very precisely such a fifth, with 703.837171 c.</p><p>&gt;  Inversely, to find exactly your fifth of 703.893 c. a generator of<br/>&gt;  1,232577031 would be needed, that would find many good<br/>&gt;  approximations in the series of that fractal (one is 53/43 with<br/>&gt;  1,23255814...).</p><p>In a curious way, either of these fifths might be relevant to the O3<br/>temperament, which although in theory a planar or &quot;rank 3&quot; temperament<br/>actually uses on my 1024-EDO synthesizer two different sizes of fifths<br/>at 600 tuning units or 703.125 cents, and 601 units of 704.297 cents.<br/>There are 7 larger fifths and 4 smaller ones in each 12-note chain,<br/>placed so that the usual minor second or limma is always 80.859 cents,<br/>very slightly wider than the theoretically just 22/21.</p><p>This means that each diminished third or large neutral second within a<br/>single chain of fifths, at 161.719 cents, will be only about 3.286<br/>cents narrow of 11/10, a step size often favored in some of the<br/>maqamat as performed in the Ottoman tradition. This 161.719-cent step<br/>would result from regular fifths at 703.828 cents, very close to your<br/>703.837171 cents!</p><p>The average fifth shown by Scala for my 1024-EDO version is 703.871<br/>cents, quite close to our 703.893 cents, the regular fifth producing a<br/>just 22/21 limma.</p><p>   Here is one that starts by this 53/43 interval :<br/>   516 : 636 : 784 : 966 : 1191 : 1468 : &gt;3619 &gt; 8919 &gt; 2749 &gt;27107 ...<br/>   where 8*516/2749 = 1.501637 = 703.843277 c.</p><p>This agreement between our approaches to Buzurg is inspiring, and I<br/>appreciate your generosity in pointing out these concordances even<br/>while preparing for a concert.</p><p>&gt;  - - - - - - - -<br/>&gt;  Jacques</p><p>Merci beaucoup,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=91609 href="#91609">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2010 10:51:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo wrote :</p><p>&gt; Dear Jacques,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your most generous comment at a time when you are<br/>&gt; preparing for a concert.

The structure is quite different from<br/>that of temperaments which I am familiar, and so your own musical<br/>judgment, plus your experience with -c, might make you indeed the<br/>ideal judge of how such a temperament might best be fine-tuned.</p><p>What I notice is that around or just below 362 cents, we get not<br/>only 3, 5, 7, 13, 23 -- but also 11! Something close to your<br/>generator for a just 23/16 is also close to (384/11)^(1/17). or<br/>361.802180 cents. It&apos;s interesting that here I was seeking to<br/>optimize 12/11 rather than 11/8, maybe showing a tendency often to<br/>think of superparticular melodic steps as well as harmonic primes.</p><p>Of course, this is in part a matter of taste where Middle Eastern<br/>musicians and theorists have cultivated a variety of flavors for<br/>over a millennium!</p><p>Thus while 12/11 is an excellent step, how about 59/54 or 128/117?<br/>We would get 154 cents with a 362-cent generator. Actually I<br/>suspect that something around 361.9 cents might be close to<br/>optimal, a zone certainly including your idea of 23^(1/15), but<br/>the melodic nuances do leave room for a range of solutions.</p><p>&gt;  I tried to see also if my &quot;Buzurg comma&quot; of 10 zalzal<br/>&gt;  generators could be reduced to 169/168 ...  this is done with<br/>&gt;  1.231875282 or 361.027442 c., but it leads to a fifth of<br/>&gt;  711.780467 c. - it would mean that pure fifhs would be<br/>&gt;  attained via one more cycle with -18 , another story.</p><p>Now I see that it is the departure from 360 cents or 3/10 octave<br/>which creates the comma!</p><p>&gt;  At this point I think a &quot;slightly under 362 c.&quot;, leading to<br/>&gt;  slightly extended fifths, or a near 362,25 c., leading to pure<br/>&gt;  fifths, would be the best options for a Buzurg-zalal generator.<br/>&gt;  I have no precise idea at this moment of what would be the<br/>&gt;  optimal &quot;slightly under 362 c.&quot; version, and as you have been<br/>&gt;  working a lot with near 704 c. fifths in relation to<br/>&gt;  Middle-East tunings I think you would know better.</p><p>The beginning of wisdom for me may be to confess that a system<br/>such as that with the Buzurg generator is quite new to me! I did<br/>find a that a range around 361.940-361.960 cents looks<br/>interesting, but that is only a first impression.  And a bit<br/>lower, around 361.910 cents, also looks attractive at first<br/>glance. [I wasn&apos;t focusing here on your 23^(1/15) at 361.884956<br/>cents, just a bit lower yet and with its own advantages!]</p><p>What I noticed is that the patterns I&apos;m familiar with using<br/>extended fifth generators do not necessarily hold! Suppose, to<br/>make the mathematics simpler, we take a generator of 362 cents,<br/>which produces a fifth of 704 cents. With a rank 2 temperament at<br/>704 cents, we have an apotome at 128 cents, and thus an interval<br/>from 14 fifths up at twice this, or 256 cents -- a fine<br/>hemifourth, but not so close to 7/6.</p><p>With the 362-cent Buzurg generator, however, we a have fifth at<br/>704 cents plus a near-7/6 at 268 cents, a near 9/7 at 436 cents,<br/>and a near 7/4 at 972 cents! This is like a rank 2 temperament<br/>with a generator around 704.8 cents, a bit wider than 37/63<br/>octave, as far as the septimal approximations.</p><p>What looking at a 48-note version of the Buzurg generator shows is<br/>that there are lots of modes present, certainly including Buzurg,<br/>Rast, and Shur!</p><p>And speaking of s-n-buzurg.scl, I notice that there&apos;s good<br/>coverage of slendro_mat.scl, with the most notable difference<br/>being a virtually just 26/15 in place of 256/147 (and likewise<br/>15/13 in place of 147/128). Here I speak of the 48-note version.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s the question of the best tuning size or sizes,<br/>possibly based on MOS sets.</p><p>Thus I&apos;d see this as a generator that derives from a Near Eastern<br/>mode (medieval Buzurg, or one flavor of Avaz-e Bayat-e Esfahan),<br/>and produces a system supporting that mode as well as many<br/>others. It may be fun to see how accurately I can emulate some of<br/>those modes using a rank 2 or rank 3 temperament with extended<br/>fifths.</p><p>&gt;   - - - - - - - -<br/>&gt;   Jacques</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=91914 href="#91914">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2010 9:35:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>In the midst of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan as the moon slowly<br/>turns to full in the night sky, when the debilitating heat and humidiy<br/>(for the first time over 40 degrees Celsius and %90 moisture) wafting<br/>over Istanbul has abated a little and fasting for the greater glory ofRahman and Rahim Allah is not anymore a burden on the persevering<br/>spirit as much as aforetimes, I find this oppurtunity to concentrate<br/>on your humourous e-mails promoting the &quot;O3 Temperament&quot; from three<br/>weeks ago.</p><p>First of all, a big thank you for your kind words and praises. How<br/>flattering to receive such attention and encouragement from you!</p><p>You will surely remember from our past correspondences, that I had<br/>remarked positively on the approach of using a chain of fifths a tad<br/>larger than pure - and even went so far as to formulate middle-<br/>resolution tuning schemes of my own in the same vein to incorporate<br/>maqam flavours in as comprehensive a manner as possible. This path<br/>promises to yield favourable results not much tried in Turkish Maqam<br/>music (where the &quot;3-limit mainstream theory market&quot; still dominates<br/>the notion of &quot;natural pitches&quot; despite my &quot;sinister presence&quot; in<br/>cyber music circles. Hah hah!)</p><p>A particular thought has occured to me while trying to follow your<br/>latest exposition of maqams such as Buzurg, Rast-Najid, Segah, etc in<br/>O3... I have found out that my memory is lately chuck full of useless<br/>everyday political dilly-dallying and I cannot recollect which maqam<br/>was transformed how in what tuning. It would be prudent, I believe,<br/>for you to categorize the maqams we have elaborated so far in one<br/>concise master article, comprising your theoretical constructs<br/>(including some of my interpretations and commentary maybe?) in theirrespective tunings and how they evolved thus in succinct steps (using<br/>cent values with dot zero decimals for quick SCALA access too).</p><p>The lengthy exegesis of makamlar in your messages requires much deeper<br/>deliberation that I can reflect to my response here. Nevertheless, let<br/>me say that Rotation 1 (13/12) Maqam Segah hits the spot very well. I<br/>also like the Rast flavour with 8/7 as perde dugah instead of the<br/>equivalent or approximation of 9/8. Yet, I feel Penchgah-i Hagar (with<br/>so low a segah and hijaz) has left the realm of Penchgah and entered<br/>that of Nihavend. Maybe one could rename it &quot;Penchgah fi Nihavend-i<br/>Hagar&quot; (Penchgah within Nihavend of Hagar). More fittingly so, since<br/>Nihavend exhibits more the Hijaz upper tetrachord you seek compared to<br/>Penchgah, which almost never shows it.</p><p>Shur and Najdi are hard to come by in Turkish circles to my knowledge,<br/>so I make no further commentary on those.</p><p>And at long last, Buzurg once more. Just a minor interjection on my<br/>part: It is my impression, based on no solid evidence except erudite<br/>conjecture, that Buzurg is supposed to be an ascending/descending:</p><p>14/13<br/>16/13<br/>56/39<br/>3/2</p><p>In one thematic version and</p><p>14/13<br/>16/13<br/>4/3<br/>56/39</p><p>diminished pentachord in another ascending/descending cadential<br/>version. I don&apos;t remember if I had mentioned this, but there it is.<br/>The latter is akin to what I dub the &quot;Ferahnak pentachord&quot;. This construct is amiss in theoretical and historical explanations of<br/>makamlar, but chanced - even if rarely - in performances if my<br/>scrutiny is to be trusted. Ah, but I see that the intiguing descending<br/>Segah upper region in your third e-mail features this very Ferahnak<br/>pentachord as well as the already-known diminished Ferahnak pentachord<br/>mixed!</p><p>About the upper &quot;Buzurg tetrachord&quot;, I imagine it would be judicious<br/>to say Hijaz-i Buzurg to punctuate the Hijaz sphere of influence here.<br/>We see such denominations as Hijaz-i Muhalif, Hijaz-i Turki, etc... to<br/>categorize maqam savours centering on Hijaz in historical sources, so,<br/>why not scale structures themselves?</p><p>So far, I liked the Buzurg variants you delineated. Good show! The<br/>possibilities of fine intonation with the O3 type tuning demonstrates clearly how our clich&eacute; notions of trying to keep segah close to 5/4 is<br/>much misguided. It has been lately my inclination to focus on 370<br/>cents or so as the nominal spot for perde segah in most (and perhaps<br/>all) instances in keeping with historicity of maqam theory.</p><p>Most cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Aug 3, 2010, at 10:43 AM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;         ----------------------------------<br/>&gt;           Ethno Extras: Zalzalian 12 set<br/>&gt;          Part 1: Introduction; Rotation 0<br/>&gt;         ----------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [To preserve formatting as much as possible, please try the Use<br/>&gt; Fixed Font Width option if viewing on the Yahoo site.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me open my participation in the &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; project<br/>&gt; with an enthusiastic homage to Jacques Dudon&apos;s most admirable<br/>&gt; version of a Near Eastern mode that has captured both of our<br/>&gt; imaginations: s-n-buzurg.scl in the &quot;3 Persia&quot; folder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Part of the genus of s-n-buzurg scale is that it constructs a<br/>&gt; medieval Buzurg mode by combining two gamelan scales of the<br/>&gt; septimal slendro type.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus my &quot;Zalzalian 12&quot; set, taken from a 24-note rank 3 or planar<br/>&gt; temperament of the roughcoated variety known as O3, presents a<br/>&gt; complete Buzurg tuning at two locations, plus some slendro and<br/>&gt; pelog modes including a complete version at the 1/1 of Erv<br/>&gt; Wilson&apos;s 1-3-7-9 hexany with its rich septimal slendro material.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further, the 12-note s-n-buzurg.scl may actually be described as<br/>&gt; a decatonic system with pairs of notes a comma apart for two of<br/>&gt; the ten basic steps. Similarly, my &quot;Zalzalian 12&quot; from the O3<br/>&gt; temperament has two of these &quot;comma pairs&quot; which often allow a<br/>&gt; choice of shadings for Near Eastern maqam/dastgah music, and also<br/>&gt; open some special possibilities for gamelan!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With great humility, please let me add that my task in this<br/>&gt; &quot;Ethno Extra&quot; is much less exacting than that faced by Jacques in<br/>&gt; his truly ingenious Buzurg tuning. He combines and integrates two<br/>&gt; distinct types of slendro yielding a rich banquet of gamelan<br/>&gt; flavors including some intervals around 241 and 257 cents, a<br/>&gt; territory not explored in my more constrained tuning. Also, he<br/>&gt; provides alternatives such as 14/13 and 13/12 above the same<br/>&gt; note, a feature not supported in this variation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before offering a Scala file of the &quot;Zalzalian 12&quot; tuning and<br/>&gt; giving a quick tour, I should say a word about the larger 24-note<br/>&gt; O3 tuning and also explain the Buzurg mode as described by two<br/>&gt; theorists from the era of around 1250-1300, Safi al-Din al-Urmawi<br/>&gt; and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------<br/>&gt; 1. What is the O3 temperament?<br/>&gt; ------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since this is not only the debut of my &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; but also of<br/>&gt; the O3 temperament on the Tuning list, I should briefly explain<br/>&gt; what this 24-note tuning system is and how it came out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The name &quot;O3&quot; is the chemical symbol for ozone, and alludes to an<br/>&gt; important event during the Ethno2 contest: the period of &quot;Ozan<br/>&gt; depletion&quot; brought about as Ozan Yarman labored to produce his<br/>&gt; peerless interpretations of Ottoman music revivifying this<br/>&gt; tradition in the cultural and technological world of the 21st<br/>&gt; century. Such a labor was necessarily taxing, and resulted in a<br/>&gt; depletion of his ability promptly to respond to tuning<br/>&gt; discussions on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This momentary crisis of Ozan depletion led me to focus on the<br/>&gt; idea of a 24-note tempered system optimizing the large Zalzalian<br/>&gt; or neutral third at 26/21 (370 cents) which he mentioned was one<br/>&gt; historical flavor for an Ottoman Rast. More generally, it was my<br/>&gt; goal to optimize all four of the Zalzalian or middle second steps<br/>&gt; discussed by medieval Islamic theorists such as Safi al-Din, and<br/>&gt; also by Ozan, the 14:13, 13:12: 12:11, and 11:10.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus the name &quot;O3&quot; not only serves as the symbol for ozone, but<br/>&gt; stands for Ozan, Ottoman, and Optimize -- this last word carrying<br/>&gt; the humble meaning of an always open goal and striving with many<br/>&gt; possible solutions, notably including George Secor&apos;s HTT-29, to<br/>&gt; which this temperament, like the rather similar Peppermint, is<br/>&gt; much indebted (and the latter, of course, also to Keenan Pepper<br/>&gt; and Erv Wilson for defining the basic regular Wilson/Pepper<br/>&gt; tuning!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To emphasize the humorous aspects of this temperament before<br/>&gt; sharing a few technical details for the curious, I should add<br/>&gt; that the name &quot;O3&quot; is also a kind of open question for Ozan and<br/>&gt; others to answer. Ozone is notably a life-protecting element when<br/>&gt; present at its natural location in the upper atmosphere, but a<br/>&gt; harmful one when it when makes an unwelcome appearance in the<br/>&gt; lower atmosphere as a component of urban smog. Thus the open<br/>&gt; question: is O3 a stratospheric flight to a pleasant layer of<br/>&gt; intonation for Ottoman music, or a pollution of the pure<br/>&gt; Istanbuline airs?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If it were a &quot;smoothcoated&quot; or simple planar (i.e. rank 3)<br/>&gt; temperament, O3 could be defined by three simple generators. The<br/>&gt; period is the 2:1 octave. The regular fifth generating each of<br/>&gt; the two 12-note chains is (84/11)^(1/5), that is, the fifth at<br/>&gt; about 703.893 cents (1.938 cents wide) that produces a regular<br/>&gt; diatonic semitone or limma at a just 22/21 (80.537 cents). The<br/>&gt; third generator, the &quot;artificial diesis&quot; or distance between<br/>&gt; the two 12-note (Eb-G#) chains, is equal to a pure 7/4 (968.825<br/>&gt; cents) less the regular major sixth of this tuning at about<br/>&gt; 911.678 cents, or 57.148 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a roughcoated planar temperament, however, O3 very slightly<br/>&gt; nuances this theoretical scheme by mapping to 1024-EDO in a way<br/>&gt; so that each 22:21 diatonic semitone is about 0.322 cents wide,<br/>&gt; and thus an 11:10 built from two such semitones is narrow by<br/>&gt; about 3.286 cents, comparable to the 3.247-cent tolerance<br/>&gt; standard of Secor&apos;s HTT-29. By comparison, 11:10 is 3.930 cents<br/>&gt; narrow in a smoothcoated (theoretical planar) version of O3, or<br/>&gt; 3.466 cents in a 104-EDO version worthy of mention since a<br/>&gt; discussion of 104-EDO on this list focused my attention on almost<br/>&gt; exactly the right size of fifth for what became the O3 system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is O3 in its roughcoated 1024-EDO version:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! O3-24.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; O3 or &quot;Ozone&quot; (24): just 22/21 limma, 7/4, 11/6 (1024-EDO version)<br/>&gt;  24<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  57.42188<br/>&gt;  126.56250<br/>&gt;  183.98438<br/>&gt;  207.42188<br/>&gt;  264.84376<br/>&gt;  288.28125<br/>&gt;  345.70313<br/>&gt;  414.84375<br/>&gt;  472.26563<br/>&gt;  495.70312<br/>&gt;  553.12500<br/>&gt;  622.26563<br/>&gt;  679.68751<br/>&gt;  703.12500<br/>&gt;  760.54688<br/>&gt;  830.85937<br/>&gt;  888.28125<br/>&gt;  911.71875<br/>&gt;  969.14063<br/>&gt;  992.57813<br/>&gt;  1050.00001<br/>&gt;  1119.14063<br/>&gt;  1176.56251<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having explained O3, with a well-merited bow to Ozan Yarman and<br/>&gt; George Secor, I should reassure readers that the 12-note or other<br/>&gt; &quot;Ethno Extras&quot; I present should speak for themselves without any<br/>&gt; need to understand the basis of this underlaying 24-note system.<br/>&gt; Rather, with s-n-buzurg and the other Ethno2 tunings as sterling<br/>&gt; examples, each Ethno Extra should be a world within itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt; 2. What is Buzurg?<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While both Jacques and I may speak of a Buzurg &quot;mode,&quot; suggesting<br/>&gt; some kind of scheme covering the range of an octave or more,<br/>&gt; strictly speaking the Buzurg of Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din is a<br/>&gt; division of the 3:2 fifth, with one form being the following.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    1/1   14/13     16/13    4/3    56/39    3/2<br/>&gt;     0     128       359     498     626     702<br/>&gt;      14:13     8:7     13:12   14:13  117:112<br/>&gt;       128      231      139     128     76<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A related scheme, also suggested in these medieval sources, uses<br/>&gt; mostly the same steps (14:13, 13:12, 8:7), but with a different<br/>&gt; ordering:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    1/1    13/12     26/21    4/3    13/9     3/2<br/>&gt;     0      139       359     498     637     702<br/>&gt;      13:12      8:7     14:13   13:12   27:26<br/>&gt;       139       231      128     128     65<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As it happens, while O3 as a whole supports both types, the<br/>&gt; Zalzalian 12 set supports only the first variety with a lower<br/>&gt; tetrachrod of 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we wish to expand the Buzurg 3:2 division to a mode in the<br/>&gt; sense of an octave division, one simple approach is to add a<br/>&gt; second tetrachord at the 3/2 symmetrical with that at the 1/1.<br/>&gt; Here we follow the first type of Buzurg, where the tetrachord is<br/>&gt; 14:13-8:7-13:12 or 128-231-139 cents:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  |----------------------|              |-------------------|<br/>&gt; 1/1   14/13   16/13    4/3    56/39   3/2   21/13  24/13  2/1<br/>&gt;  0     128     359     498     626    702    830   1061  1200<br/>&gt;   14:13    8:7    13:12   14:13 117:112  14:13  8:7  13:12<br/>&gt;    128     231     139     128     76     128   231   139<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As we shall see, some other types of upper tetrachords also seem<br/>&gt; congenial to Buzurg, and really &quot;making a maqam out of it&quot; calls<br/>&gt; for a melodic path or procedure often involving inflections or<br/>&gt; modulations. However, this concept of a &quot;Buzurg mode&quot; is one<br/>&gt; starting point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the Zalzalian 12 set, as it happens, such a Buzurg mode does<br/>&gt; not appear on the 1/1 (as it does in s-n-buzurg.scl), but rather<br/>&gt; on the steps at 346 cents (11/9 or 39/32) and 843 cents (13/8).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus before getting to our first Buzurg mode, we&apos;ll encounter<br/>&gt; some other Near Eastern and gamelan modes; but I should assure<br/>&gt; Buzurg lovers that we will get there!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 3. Ethno Extras: The Zalzalian 12 set<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is the 12-note set as a Scala file:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ! O3-zalzalian12_D.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Sampling of Zalzalian maqam/dastgah modes, slendro/pelog modes<br/>&gt;  12<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  138.28125<br/>&gt;  207.42187<br/>&gt;  264.84375<br/>&gt;  345.70312<br/>&gt;  472.26563<br/>&gt;  680.85937<br/>&gt;  704.29687<br/>&gt;  842.57813<br/>&gt;  969.14063<br/>&gt;  1050.00000<br/>&gt;  1176.56249<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note the presence of two 23-cent commas, interestingly involving<br/>&gt; the fifth and octave above the 1/1. In the overall context of O3,<br/>&gt; this might be interpreted as 78/77, for example, so that one JI<br/>&gt; interpretation of this set is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1  13/8 44/39 7/6  11/9 21/16 77/52 3/2 13/8  7/4  11/6 77/39  2/1<br/>&gt;  0   139   207  267  347   472   680  702  841  969  1049  1178 1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As with s-n-buzurg.scl, the commas make possible lots of nuances<br/>&gt; and choices -- and also, here, an MOS septimal slendro mode<br/>&gt; possibly a bit outside the parameters of Jacques&apos; famous article<br/>&gt; in 1/1. For those in suspense, this comes up in the last rotation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, a disclaimer. I am used to playing this subset as a portion<br/>&gt; of the 24-note O3 keyboard layout with two 12-note manuals, and<br/>&gt; am not sure what the most intuitive arrangement would be on a<br/>&gt; single 12-note keyboard, for which it is definitely intended!<br/>&gt; Advice from Jacques and others would be warmly welcome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To get a quick preview of our tour, we can look at a Scala matrix<br/>&gt; of the rotations, which I&apos;m reformatting a bit to reduce the line<br/>&gt; length and also to identify the number of each rotation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 0:  1/1<br/>&gt;  0 138.3 207.4 264.8 345.7 472.3 680.9 704.3 842.6 969.1 1050.0<br/>&gt; 1176.6 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 1:  138.3 (~13/12)<br/>&gt;  0 69.1  126.6 207.4 334.0 542.6 566.0 704.3 830.9 911.7 1038.3<br/>&gt; 1061.7 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 2:  207.4 (~9/8 or ~44/39)<br/>&gt;  0 57.4  138.3 264.8 473.4 496.9 635.2 761.7 842.6 969.1 992.6<br/>&gt; 1130.9 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 3:  264.8 (~7/6)<br/>&gt;  0 80.9  207.4 416.0 439.5 577.7 704.3 785.2 911.7 935.2 1073.4<br/>&gt; 1142.6 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 4:  345.7 (~11/9)<br/>&gt;  0 126.6 335.2 358.6 496.9 623.4 704.3 830.9 854.3 992.6 1061.7<br/>&gt; 1119.1 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 5:  472.3 (~21/16)<br/>&gt;  0 208.6 232.0 370.3 496.9 577.7 704.3 727.7 866.0 935.2 992.6<br/>&gt; 1073.4 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 6:  680.9 (~77/52)<br/>&gt;  0 23.4  161.7 288.3 369.1 495.7 519.1 657.4 726.6 784.0 864.8<br/>&gt; 991.4  2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 7:  704.3 (~3/2)<br/>&gt;  0 138.3 264.8 345.7 472.3 495.7 634.0 703.1 760.5 841.4 968.0<br/>&gt; 1176.6 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 8:  842.6 (~13/8)<br/>&gt;  0 126.6 207.4 334.0 357.4 495.7 564.8 622.3 703.1 829.7 1038.3<br/>&gt; 1061.7 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Rotation 9:  969.1 (~7/4)<br/>&gt;  0 80.9  207.4 230.9 369.1 438.3 495.7 576.6 703.1 911.7 935.2<br/>&gt; 1073.4 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rotation 10: 1050.0 (~11/6)<br/>&gt;  0 126.6 150.0 288.3 357.4 414.8 495.7 622.3 830.9 854.3 992.6<br/>&gt; 1119.1 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rotation 11: 1176.6 (~77/39)<br/>&gt;  0 23.4  161.7 230.9 288.3 369.1 495.7 704.3 727.7 866.0 992.6<br/>&gt; 1073.4 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From this &quot;itinerary,&quot; some readers may draw a few conclusions.<br/>&gt; Thus Rotations 4 (~11/9) and 8 (~13/8) include Buzurg modes,<br/>&gt; while Rotations 5 (~21/16) and 9 (~7/4) look like good places for<br/>&gt; Rast, and Rotation 7 (~3/2) likewise for Shur.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll encounter these and more, and I warmly invite readers to<br/>&gt; celebrate other modes, gamelan or Near Eastern or other, that<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve missed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Rotation 0 (1/1): Slendro, pelog, and Wilson&apos;s 1-3-7-9 hexany<br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0 138.3 207.4 264.8 345.7 472.3 680.9 704.3 842.6 969.1 1050.0<br/>&gt; 1176.6 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Starting on the 1/1 or Scala step 0 of the Zalzalian 12 set, we<br/>&gt; find the slendro and pelog modes that originally served to define<br/>&gt; the 10-note nucleus of the tuning.

In the wider context of our<br/>&gt; 12-note set, this sonority has a striking resolution to a fifth<br/>&gt; featuring Zalzalian or neutral second steps around 13:12 and<br/>&gt; 14:13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      969   843<br/>&gt;      704   843<br/>&gt;      265   138<br/>&gt;       0    138<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keeping our focus on septimal slendro, this rotation offers a<br/>&gt; complete tempered version of Erv Wilson&apos;s 1-3-7-9 hexany:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     0    207   265   472   704    969   1200<br/>&gt;    1/1   9/8   7/6  21/16  3/2    7/4    2/1<br/>&gt;       207   57   207    232   265    231<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In addition to the slendro mode above with an opening 7:6 step,<br/>&gt; we have a mode with an opening 9:8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         0   207    472   704    969   1200<br/>&gt;        1/1  9/8   21/16  3/2    7/4    2/1<br/>&gt;          207   265    232   265    231<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This second type with steps of 9:8-7:6-8:7-7:6-8:7 is a rotation<br/>&gt; of Jacques&apos; N or &quot;Natural&quot; variety of septimal slendro, while the<br/>&gt; first type with 7:6-9:8-8:7:7:6-8:7 is a rotation of his M or<br/>&gt; &quot;Mirror image&quot; mode in relation to N.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both N and M modes have three step sizes: 7:6, 8:7, and 9:8. We<br/>&gt; will also encounter M and N in their original rotations as we<br/>&gt; move through the Zalzalian 12 set -- but not other, more complex<br/>&gt; septimal slendro patterns present in s-n-buzurg.scl.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another basic component of the Zalzalian 12 set is a basic pelog<br/>&gt; mode using a narrow fifth at 681 cents, and optionally a narrow<br/>&gt; octave at 1177 cents also! Here I use a vertical bar | to<br/>&gt; indicate two versions of the &quot;same step,&quot; which might well<br/>&gt; both be used at different points in a performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      0     138     346    681   843    1177|1200<br/>&gt;     1/ 1  13/12   11/9   77/52  13/8   77/39| 2/1<br/>&gt;       138      207    335    162   334|357<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While this was the pelog that first caught my attention, another<br/>&gt; form also seems attractive to me, with the first three notes<br/>&gt; suggesting to me a septimal Shur Dastgah but also not too far<br/>&gt; from reported averages for one typical variety  of pelog mode.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      0    138   265   681   843    1177|1200<br/>&gt;     1/1  13/12  7/6  77/52  13/8  77/39| 2/1<br/>&gt;       138    127   415   162  334/357<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we willing to explore &quot;altered&quot; forms of Near Eastern modes<br/>&gt; with a 21/16 substituted for the usual 4/3, then two other modes<br/>&gt; stand out to me. Some modern Arab theory speaks of tetrachords<br/>&gt; which at times may be narrowed by a comma, while Nelly Caron and<br/>&gt; Dariouche Safvate write that a fourth of around 484 cents was<br/>&gt; common in traditional Persian tuning, notably appearing in an<br/>&gt; older version of the Avaz-e Bayat-e Tork (to be included in Ethno<br/>&gt; Extras).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One possibility is a version of Ibn Sina&apos;s 11th-century tuning<br/>&gt; with Shur-like qualities where the narrow 21/16 serves for Ibn<br/>&gt; Sina&apos;s original 4/3:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    0   138   265   472   704   843  969  1200<br/>&gt;   1/1 13/12  7/6  21/16  3/2  13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>&gt;     138   127  207    232  138   127   231<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some exploration at the keyboard shows me that this is a fine<br/>&gt; Shur from a melodic point of view, and offers some beautiful<br/>&gt; polyphonic cadences if one wishes to develop dastgah-based<br/>&gt; counterpoint. The 21/16 step plays a premier role in making some<br/>&gt; of these progressions and shadings possible, for example in this<br/>&gt; cadence featuring a small Zalzalian or neutral third at 334 cents<br/>&gt; which expands to a fifth:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          843 (13/8)   969 (7/4)  1200 (2/1)<br/>&gt;          472 (21/16)              704 (3/2)<br/>&gt;          138 (13/12)               0  (1/1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the opening sonority of 0-334-704 might represent 14:17:21,<br/>&gt; with the highest voice then moving up by a 127-cent step so that<br/>&gt; the sonority becomes 0-334-831, with 52:63:84 as one JI reading<br/>&gt; suggested by the near-pure 21:13 small neutral sixth not far from<br/>&gt; the intriguing ratio of Phi (833.090 cents). Then, the small<br/>&gt; neutral neutral third and sixth expand to fifth and octave in a<br/>&gt; manner recalling the classic European polyphony practiced in the<br/>&gt; era of Safi al-Din and Qutb al-Din -- or more precisely as it<br/>&gt; might have been practiced if the Zalzalian intervals of these and<br/>&gt; other Islamic theorists had been part of its vocabulary!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another possibility is a variation on Jacques Dudon&apos;s beautiful<br/>&gt; Ibina, 1/1-13/12-11/9-4/3-3/2-13/8-16/9-2/1. The lower tetrachord<br/>&gt; is of the Mohajira type with Z-T-Z where &quot;Z&quot; is a Zalzalian or<br/>&gt; neutral second and &quot;T&quot; and regular major second or tone, while<br/>&gt; the upper tetrachord on the 3/2 is a form of Shur, Turkish<br/>&gt; Ushshaq, or Arab Bayyati, with Z-Z-T, two Zalzalian steps<br/>&gt; followed by a tone. Here both the 4/3 fourth and 16/9 minor<br/>&gt; seventh are lowered by a comma to 21/16 and 7/4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &quot;Narrow Moha&quot;           Shur/Bayyati<br/>&gt;    |----------------|     |----------------|<br/>&gt;    0   138   346   472   704   843  969  1200<br/>&gt;   1/1 13/12  11/9 21/16  3/2  13/8  7/4   2/1<br/>&gt;     138   207   127   232   138   127   231<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, in a curious way, the lower Mohajira (&quot;Moha&quot; for short)<br/>&gt; variant tetrachord introduces two of the steps of Buzurg: a lower<br/>&gt; 138-cent step representing 13:12, and an upper 127-cent step<br/>&gt; representing 14:13. The middle step, however, is a comma narrower<br/>&gt; than Buzurg&apos;s usual 8:7 (231 cents), at 207 cents or a near-9:8<br/>&gt; (also a near-44:39), so that the fourth is compressed from a<br/>&gt; usual rounded 496 or 497 cents in this temperament to 472 cents,<br/>&gt; or in JI terms from 4/3 to 21/16.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I am not aware of any discussion of these specific altered<br/>&gt; modes in medieval or modern Near Eastern theory, I mention them<br/>&gt; in keeping with the adventurous xenharmonic spirit of Ethno, and<br/>&gt; also the wise adage that one should not spurn what the equations<br/>&gt; or tuning parameters generously cast at one&apos;s feet. In fact, as I<br/>&gt; relate above, the Shur with 21/16 in place of 4/3 proves both<br/>&gt; melodically apt and contrapuntally delightful when considered as<br/>&gt; a mode in its own right, as well as resembling the kind of<br/>&gt; pattern I often fall into when improvising in a septimal Shur or<br/>&gt; Arab Bayyati where a usual 4/3 step is the norm but the<br/>&gt; progression of the _sayr_ or development may lead at some points<br/>&gt; to the lowering of this step by a comma. Likewise, the Ibina-like<br/>&gt; mode with lowered steps at 21/16 and 7/4, although not following<br/>&gt; the original scheme of differential coherence (-c), nevertheless<br/>&gt; presents fruitful possibilities as a septimal variation on the<br/>&gt; Mohajira/Ibina theme.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Conclusion of Part 1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

How flattering to receive such attention and<br/>&gt; encouragement from you!</p><p>What I cannot overemphasize are the benefits of reading your<br/>thesis which you have so generously made available. The<br/>translations of Turkish documents and accounts of the controversy<br/>over Alla Franca and Alla Turca into English, including the<br/>question of maqam intonation and &quot;quartertones,&quot; are at once<br/>illuminating, entertaining, and at another level tragic when we<br/>remember the promising musical careers ruined. You guide the<br/>reader through an appreciation of all these levels of Turkish<br/>music theory and criticism in the 20th century.</p><p>And for me, seeing that explanation of a performer&apos;s measured<br/>intonation in Maqam Ushshaq was a wonderful moment (pp. 27-29),<br/>as if to confirm the validity of the quest for a more accurate<br/>and more diverse intonation of middle or Zalzalian intervals, a<br/>quest reflected in sometimes similar and sometimes different ways<br/>in systems such as Yarman-79/80-MOS, Yarman-24, and O3.</p><p>You have indeed been my mentor, for it was a desire to enjoy a<br/>small part of the richness of the 79/80-MOS, and especially the<br/>diversity of superparticular middle second steps, that led early<br/>this summer to the O3 temperament.</p><p>&gt; You will surely remember from our past correspondences, that I<br/>&gt; had remarked positively on the approach of using a chain of<br/>&gt; fifths a tad larger than pure - and even went so far as to<br/>&gt; formulate middle- resolution tuning schemes of my own in the<br/>&gt; same vein to incorporate maqam flavours in as comprehensive a<br/>&gt; manner as possible. This path promises to yield favourable<br/>&gt; results not much tried in Turkish Maqam music (where the<br/>&gt; &quot;3-limit mainstream theory market&quot; still dominates the notion<br/>&gt; of &quot;natural pitches&quot; despite my &quot;sinister presence&quot; in cyber<br/>&gt; music circles. Hah hah!)</p><p>A curious point here is that O3, from one point of view, uses &quot;a<br/>chain of fifths a tad larger than pure&quot; in order to achieve a<br/>tuning not too far from that likely for a 12-note Halberstadt<br/>keyboard in 14th-century Europe in a Pythagorean Eb-G# (more on<br/>that tuning, about which you asked, in another post), while<br/>stretching the fifths just enough to get an apotome near 14:13<br/>and a diminished third near 11:10. A look at Maqam Rast on B, and<br/>Maqam Huseyni on C#, may be instructive:</p><p>            Rast                        Rast<br/>   |-------------------|.......|--------------------|<br/> rast   dugah  segah chargah  neva huseyni  evdj gerdaniye<br/>   B      C#     Eb    E       F#     G#     Bb     B<br/>  0.0   207.4  369.1 495.7    703.1  911.7 1073.4 1200.0 ~ 1/1   44/39  26/21  4/3      3/2   22/13  13/7   2/1</p><p>In this ascending form of Rast, we have two Rast tetrachords at<br/>207.4-161.7-126.6 cents and 208.6-161.7-126.6 cents.

As very<br/>aptly put in the article of you and your colleagues on &quot;Theory<br/>vs. Practice&quot; in Turkish intonation, Ezgi later &quot;back-pedalled&quot;<br/>and settled on the orthodox Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek (AEU) ratio of a<br/>Pythagorean diminished third at 65536:59049 or 180.45 cents (see page 50, the sixth page of the PDF version):</p><p>   &lt;<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/theoryVSpractice.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/theoryVSpractice.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Since calling 161.7 cents a close representation of 11/10 when it<br/>is about 3.3 cents narrow might literally be a bit of a stretch,<br/>as you are often wont to say, I have styled it a 56/51 (161.9<br/>cents); but I would say it is not unreasonably far from 11/10,<br/>and apt as a dugah-segah step in either Rast or Huseyni.</p><p>For both Rast and Huseyni, of course, perde ajem at A is very<br/>handy as the minor seventh of Acemli Rast (992.6 cents) or the<br/>minor sixth often used in Huseyni (784.0 cents), for example; but<br/>my purpose here is simply to illustrate how the moderate<br/>tempering of the fifth brings about a tetrachord like that of<br/>Safi al-Din or Ezgi in his original 1933 version of Huseyni.</p><p>&gt; A particular thought has occured to me while trying to follow<br/>&gt; your latest exposition of maqams such as Buzurg, Rast-Najid,<br/>&gt; Segah, etc in O3... I have found out that my memory is lately<br/>&gt; chuck full of useless everyday political dilly-dallying and I<br/>&gt; cannot recollect which maqam was transformed how in what<br/>&gt; tuning. It would be prudent, I believe, for you to categorize<br/>&gt; the maqams we have elaborated so far in one concise master<br/>&gt; article, comprising your theoretical constructs (including some<br/>&gt; of my interpretations and commentary maybe?) in their<br/>&gt; respective tunings and how they evolved thus in succinct steps<br/>&gt; (using cent values with dot zero decimals for quick SCALA<br/>&gt; access too).</p><p>This is an excellent proposal! Indeed, Inshallah, it should be my<br/>next step after finishing my Zalzalian 12 articles. I realize, in<br/>fact, that the kind of concise guide to some main maqamat that<br/>you describe could be a helpful guide to the Zalzalian 12<br/>articles. And the discussion of Yarman-79/80 tunings for some of<br/>the principal maqamat in your thesis is one fine model for such<br/>an article regarding O3.</p><p>Another complication of something like the Zalzalian 12 articles<br/>is that such a 12-note set may invite one to come up with<br/>&quot;variations&quot; on maqamat where one or more usual steps are missing<br/>or out of place by a comma, say. This can be a creative process,<br/>but perhaps easier to follow if the reader were first familiar<br/>with the usual forms of such maqamat. Thus it becomes especially<br/>helpful to know &quot;which maqam was transformed how,&quot; as you put it.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more attractive a model the<br/>presentation in your thesis becomes.</p><p>Since this may be our first discussion of O3, maybe I should try<br/>my hand at a draft of the article we are discussing, share it<br/>with you by private e-mail, and then add any commentary you might<br/>offer for the version for this list, as well as any relevant<br/>interpretations or commentary from earlier discussions you might<br/>suggest.</p><p>And your idea, when using rounded cents, to give dot zero<br/>decimals for Scala access is an excellent one I will follow!</p><p>&gt; The lengthy exegesis of makamlar in your messages requires much<br/>&gt; deeper deliberation that I can reflect to my response<br/>&gt; here. Nevertheless, let me say that Rotation 1 (13/12) Maqam<br/>&gt; Segah hits the spot very well. I also like the Rast flavour<br/>&gt; with 8/7 as perde dugah instead of the equivalent or<br/>&gt; approximation of 9/8. Yet, I feel Penchgah-i Hagar (with so low<br/>&gt; a segah and hijaz) has left the realm of Penchgah and entered<br/>&gt; that of Nihavend. Maybe one could rename it &quot;Penchgah fi<br/>&gt; Nihavend-i Hagar&quot; (Penchgah within Nihavend of Hagar). More<br/>&gt; fittingly so, since Nihavend exhibits more the Hijaz upper<br/>&gt; tetrachord you seek compared to Penchgah, which almost never<br/>&gt; shows it.</p><p>As to Penchgah fi Nihavend-i Hagar, I absolutely agree that this<br/>is quite different from Penchgah, and belongs to a different<br/>realm. And if your ear deems it to fit the name of Nihavend, I<br/>will gladly accept your judgment. As I realized when seeking for<br/>a name, &quot;Penchgah&quot; in this context means simply &quot;with a step at<br/>around a 9:8 above perde segah.&quot; Your name ingeniously expresses<br/>the situation very nicely! May I add that the realm of Penchgah<br/>with segah at 26/21 is most delightful, with the simple form<br/>available on a single 12-note keyboard:</p><p>             Penchgah                   Rast<br/>   |---------------------------|-------------------|<br/> rast   dugah  segah   hijaz  neva huseyni  evdj gerdaniye<br/>   B      C#     Eb      F     F#     G#     Bb    B<br/>   0    207.4  369.1   576.6 703.1  911.7 1073.4 1200.0<br/>~ 1/1   44/39  26/21   88/63   3/2  22/13  13/7   2/1</p><p>And I must agree, even as a newcomer not acquainted with the<br/>nuances of the seyir for Penchgah and its common modulations,<br/>that I would not think of an upper Hijaz -- quite unlike Penchgah<br/>fi Nihavend-i Hagar, where it is a usual part of the seyir.<br/>And it might be said that while the steps or perde-s form the<br/>frame or skeleton of a maqam, the seyir is the flesh and blood.</p><p>&gt; Shur and Najdi are hard to come by in Turkish circles to my<br/>&gt; knowledge, so I make no further commentary on those.</p><p>With Shur, it is interesting that Turkish performers sometimes<br/>play a very low or septimal Ushshaq, if we may take as an example<br/>the performance of &quot;a venerable Turkish Neyzen&quot; or _Niyazi<br/>Sayin_. as you explain in your thesis at pp. 27-29. Here I quote<br/>your measured steps for this __Niyazi Sayin Ushshak Ney_ Taksim<br/>and JI values, plus an approximation in O3 (full 24 notes):</p><p>Niyazi Sayin Ushshak Ney Taksim:  123.47    137.13     227.87</p><p>JI:                               128.30    138.57     231.17<br/>                                   14:13     13:12       8:7</p><p>O3:                               126.56    138.28     230.86</p><p>However, while either this low flavor of Ushshaq or a similar<br/>flavor of Shur might suggest a medieval 28:26:24:21, Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>famous tetrachord or a permutation of it (if 12:13:14:16 is his<br/>actual form), the seyir of Ushshaq would, of course, differ from<br/>that of Shur Dastgah.</p><p>And I am not sure if Najdi is very common in the Arab world,<br/>although it is mentioned by theorists such as Amine Beyhom. One<br/>might actually think of it as two conjunct Rast tetrachords plus<br/>a _lower_ tone. In a typical Arab intonation as realized in O3,<br/>perde segah (or, in Arabic, sikah) might be at 357.4 or 358.6<br/>cents, close to Jacques Dudon&apos;s 59/48 or the 16/13 of Yarman-24.<br/>To play Nadji with segah at around 26/21 is really taking an Arab<br/>maqam and applying an Ottoman intonation, I would guess.</p><p>&gt; And at long last, Buzurg once more. Just a minor interjection<br/>&gt; on my part: It is my impression, based on no solid evidence<br/>&gt; except erudite conjecture, that Buzurg is supposed to be an<br/>&gt; ascending/descending:</p><p>&gt; 14/13<br/>&gt; 16/13<br/>&gt; 56/39<br/>&gt; 3/2</p><p>An interesting point is the steps of 14:13-8:7-7:6-117:112<br/>(128.3-231.2-266.9-75.6 cents). The adjacent 8:7 and 7:6 steps in<br/>the middle lead me to ask if these steps occur together, thus in<br/>effect dividing 4:3 into a trichord of 8:7:6, in other maqamat.<br/>I need to try playing this and seeing where it takes me, but your<br/>erudite intuition is indeed to be carefully considered.</p><p>&gt; In one thematic version and</p><p>&gt; 14/13<br/>&gt; 16/13<br/>&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt; 56/39</p><p>&gt; diminished pentachord in another ascending/descending cadential<br/>&gt; version. I don&apos;t remember if I had mentioned this, but there it<br/>&gt; is.  The latter is akin to what I dub the &quot;Ferahnak<br/>&gt; pentachord&quot;.</p><p>Looking at a few page on the web about Makam Ferahnak, I see some<br/>parallels, and some with a maqam we were previously discussing<br/>(see below). It is curious that I found a descending seyir with<br/>this pentachord through an analogy with Shur Dastgah, where the<br/>fifth is often lowered by a koron, or often about 1/3 tone, in<br/>descending.</p><p>You should indeed educate me more on Ferahnak. and how you<br/>interpret the intonation and the seyir. What I will quickly<br/>mention here is a version on the web from Ezgi where, if I take<br/>the signs of S and K (lesser and greater mujannab) as around<br/>14/13 and 11/10, the maqam seems very similar to our Penchgah fi<br/>Nihavend-i Hagar. Here I will use O3 pitches:</p><p>              Ferahnak                 Hijaz<br/>    |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>    Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B      D    Eb<br/>    0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1119.1 1200.0<br/>      S       T      T      K     S     A      B<br/>    126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 288.3   81.9</p><p>And what I take to be a descending form, reminding me of your<br/>suggestion for Nihavend that the descending seventh degree should<br/>form a perfect fifth with the third step of the lower tetrachord,<br/>here C#-G#:</p><p>              Ferahnak                Segah<br/>    |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>    Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B    C#     Eb<br/>    0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1038.3 1200.0<br/>      S       T      T      K     S     T      K<br/>    126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 207.4  161.7</p><p>&gt; This construct is amiss in theoretical and historical<br/>&gt; explanations of makamlar, but chanced - even if rarely - in<br/>&gt; performances if my scrutiny is to be trusted.

(I<br/>read this paragraph earlier, but had yet checked my earlier post<br/>to see exactly which ajnas (genera) you were referring to here,<br/>evidently the Segah variations at the end of my Part 3 on the<br/>Zalzalian 12 set.</p><p>One thing I did not have available in the Zalzalian 12 set,<br/>although it is available on a single 12-note keyboard, is a<br/>seventh at 20/11 or 51/28, here more the latter at 1038.3 cents,<br/>in that rotation.  And I might say that the lower pentachord<br/>found in both of Ezgi&apos;s forms of Ferahnak, and also Penchgah fi<br/>Nihavend-i Hagar, is related to a 1/1-14/13-40/33-4/3 flavor of<br/>Segah or the like rather as Makam Penchgah is to Rast (with segah<br/>at around 26/21).</p><p>Returning to Buzurg, the difference I&apos;d see is that the latter<br/>has a semitone below the fifth, or acting as a kind of lowered<br/>fifth, at around 56/39; while in Ferahnak we have a step maybe<br/>not too much higher than 15/11, here 542.6 cents. But I agree<br/>it&apos;s intriguing how the descending Segah region in Part 3 of my<br/>Zalzalian 12 series of articles brings into play the 56/39 also<br/>found in Buzurg, and thus the Ferahnak ajnas you are discussing.</p><p>&gt; About the upper &quot;Buzurg tetrachord&quot;, I imagine it would be<br/>&gt; judicious to say Hijaz-i Buzurg to punctuate the Hijaz sphere<br/>&gt; of influence here.  We see such denominations as Hijaz-i<br/>&gt; Muhalif, Hijaz-i Turki, etc... to categorize maqam savours<br/>&gt; centering on Hijaz in historical sources, so, why not scale<br/>&gt; structures themselves?</p><p>Certainly an upper tetrachord of 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3, or in the<br/>example from O3, 0.0-126.6-357.4-495.7 cents, could fit with one<br/>flavor of Turkish Hijaz: Hijaz-i Buzurg might be exactly right!<br/>And in the world of Iranian music, one might call this Avaz-e<br/>Bayat-e Esfahan-e Buzurg (if so many possessives are admissible),<br/>or simply Esfahan-e Buzurg, to distinguish it from various other<br/>flavors of Esfahan. Farhat gives Esfahan, if one applies his tar<br/>tuning to his notation, as</p><p>            D    Ep     F&gt;     G<br/>           0.0  135.0  360.0  495.0<br/>             135.0  225.0  135.0</p><p>By the way, Hijaz-e Muhalif reminds me of the Persian Mokhalef,<br/>another topic (and rather like one flavor of Esfahan)! I&apos;d love<br/>to learn more about Hijaz-i Muhalif.</p><p>&gt; So far, I liked the Buzurg variants you delineated. Good show!<br/>&gt; The possibilities of fine intonation with the O3 type tuning<br/>&gt; demonstrates clearly how our clich?? notions of trying to keep<br/>&gt; segah close to 5/4 is much misguided. It has been lately my<br/>&gt; inclination to focus on 370 cents or so as the nominal spot for<br/>&gt; perde segah in most (and perhaps all) instances in keeping with<br/>&gt; historicity of maqam theory.</p><p>Indeed O3 is designed to place perde segah at around 370 cents in<br/>order to optimize the kind of historical Ottoman flavor we are<br/>discussing.

The<br/>&gt; translations of Turkish documents and accounts of the controversy<br/>&gt; over Alla Franca and Alla Turca into English, including the<br/>&gt; question of maqam intonation and &quot;quartertones,&quot; are at once<br/>&gt; illuminating, entertaining, and at another level tragic when we<br/>&gt; remember the promising musical careers ruined.

This path promises to yield favourable<br/>&gt;&gt; results not much tried in Turkish Maqam music (where the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;3-limit mainstream theory market&quot; still dominates the notion<br/>&gt;&gt; of &quot;natural pitches&quot; despite my &quot;sinister presence&quot; in cyber<br/>&gt;&gt; music circles. Hah hah!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A curious point here is that O3, from one point of view, uses &quot;a<br/>&gt; chain of fifths a tad larger than pure&quot; in order to achieve a<br/>&gt; tuning not too far from that likely for a 12-note Halberstadt<br/>&gt; keyboard in 14th-century Europe in a Pythagorean Eb-G# (more on<br/>&gt; that tuning, about which you asked, in another post), while<br/>&gt; stretching the fifths just enough to get an apotome near 14:13<br/>&gt; and a diminished third near 11:10. A look at Maqam Rast on B, and<br/>&gt; Maqam Huseyni on C#, may be instructive:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Rast                        Rast<br/>&gt;    |-------------------|.......|--------------------|<br/>&gt;  rast   dugah  segah chargah  neva huseyni  evdj gerdaniye<br/>&gt;    B      C#     Eb    E       F#     G#     Bb     B<br/>&gt;   0.0   207.4  369.1 495.7    703.1  911.7 1073.4 1200.0<br/>&gt; ~ 1/1   44/39  26/21  4/3      3/2   22/13  13/7   2/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>A wonderfully designed scale of rightful pitches supporting not only<br/>maqams Rast and Huseyni, but also Segah.</p><p>&gt; In this ascending form of Rast, we have two Rast tetrachords at<br/>&gt; 207.4-161.7-126.6 cents and 208.6-161.7-126.6 cents.

This appears on p. 10 of Dr. Fazli<br/>&gt; Arslan&apos;s most admirable publication, where this tetrachord is<br/>&gt; termed &quot;Medium disjunct.&quot; And &quot;disjunct&quot; here, as Arslan<br/>&gt; explains, refers not to an arrangement of two tetrachords, but to<br/>&gt; the &quot;skipping&quot; within the tetrachord from 9:8 to 11:10, omitting<br/>&gt; the intervening superparticular ratio of 10:9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &lt;<a href="http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/The__Theory_of_Music.pdf">http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/The__Theory_of_Music.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Frankly, I do not think Fazli chose the best English wording here for<br/>the Arabic originals. Rauf Yekta had suggested as early as 1922 the<br/>correct wordings in French of those terms adopted by early Islamic<br/>theorists from Hellenistic literature. Let me recapitulate them here.</p><p>According to Safi al-din Urmavi in his &quot;Risalat al-Sharafiyyah&quot;, if<br/>the largest of three melodic intervals within a tetrachord is greater<br/>in size than the sum of the other two, the genus is called &quot;Leyyin&quot; -<br/>if not, &quot;Qawi&quot;. Monz would surely recognize with satisfaction that one<br/>proper translation of the former term is his proposed adjective<br/>&quot;relaxed&quot;. Indeed, &quot;Leyyin&quot; is Arabic for &quot;soft, softened, light,<br/>gentle, easy-going, mild, mellow, smooth, creamy, etc...&quot; and is<br/>obviously the chosen equivalent of the Greek word &quot;Malakon&quot;. Likewise,<br/>&quot;Qawi&quot; means &quot;sturdy, rigid, firm, tenacious, resistant, strong,<br/>powerful, safe, secure, trustworthy, well-supplied, propertied etc...&quot;<br/>some of which correspond justly to the Greek word<br/>&quot;Syntonon&quot; (strained). I feel Monz&apos; proposed &quot;tense&quot; might not be the<br/>best translation for the Arabic term compared to &quot;firm&quot; here.</p><p>In the same &quot;esprit&quot;, Rauf Yekta translates Leyyin as &quot;mou&quot; (soft) and<br/>Qawi as &quot;fort&quot; (strong) in the section devoted to his monograph in<br/>Encyclop&eacute;die de la musique et dictionnaire du Conservatoire (p. 2990):</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>L&apos;ensemble de trois intervalles ordonn&eacute;s dans une<br/>quarte s&apos;appelle &laquo; genre &raquo; (j-i&raquo;-.

Si l&apos;un des trois intervalles<br/>d&apos;un genre est d&apos;un rapport plus grand que la somme<br/>des deux autres, le genre est mou (j^) ; s&apos;il n&apos;en est<br/>pas ainsi, il est fort (i^y).</p><p>Le genre mou se divise en trois parties princi-<br/>pales :</p><p>1&deg; Le genre normal (RASIM).<br/>2&deg; Le genre chromatique (LEVNI).<br/>3&deg; Le genre ordonnateur (NAZIM).</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Urmevi goes on to permute the intervals he categorized under these two<br/>general types of tetrachord (Leyyin &amp; Qawi) so that he positions the<br/>largest interval either on the left, on the right, or in the middle<br/>(for he accepts no more than 3 interval ratios per tetrachord). He<br/>eventually comes up with 6 classes per tetrachord type, 2 of which<br/>become &quot;gayr-i muntazam&quot; (disorderly) for having the largest in the<br/>middle, the other 2 of which become &quot;muntazam mutetali&quot; (sequentially<br/>ordered) for intervals sizes arranged from high to low (or low to<br/>high), and the last two of which become &quot;muntazam gayr-i<br/>mutetali&quot; (non-sequentially ordered).</p><p>Those tetrachords that employ 5:4 as the largest interval among three<br/>are called RASIM,<br/>Those tetrachords that employ 6:5 as the largest interval among three<br/>are called LEVNI,<br/>Those tetrachords that employ 7:6 as the largest interval among three<br/>are called NAZIM.</p><p>Yekta has translated RASIM (that which draws or flows through) as<br/>normal, LEVNI (that which cascades in colours) as chromatic, and NAZIM<br/>(arranging one after the other) as organizing.</p><p>These translations do fairness to the Arabic originals, which insooth<br/>stand for the famous &quot;Diatonic&quot;, &quot;Chromatic&quot; and &quot;Enharmonic&quot; genera<br/>respectively.</p><p>Following table after table of permutations, Urmevi shows a new<br/>method, where he uses the same interval ratio twice in a tetrachord. A<br/>pair of 8/7s makes the tetrachord &quot;qawi zu al-taz&apos;eef fi al-<br/>awwal&quot; (the first paired of the FIRM genus); a pair of 9/8s makes the<br/>tetrachord &quot;zu al-taz&apos;eef fi al-thani&quot; (the second paired); a pair of<br/>10/9s makes the tetrachord &quot;zu al-taz&apos;eef fi al-thalith&quot; (the third<br/>paired).</p><p>Yet another operation for finding new tetrachords for Urmavi is taking<br/>a pair of sequential superparticular ratios. Safi al-din pairs a 8/7<br/>and 9/8 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil al-Awwal&quot; (the first conjoined); a 9/8<br/>and 10/9 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil al-Awsat&quot; (the middle conjoined); a<br/>10/9 and 11/10 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil al-Thalith&quot; (the third conjoined).</p><p>The same operation where one diminishing superparticular ratio is<br/>skipped yields &quot;qawi munfasil&quot; (Firm, sundered) for 8/7 and 10/9;<br/>&quot;mutadil munfasil&quot; (Moderate, sundered) for 9/8 and 11/10; and &quot;Shedd<br/>munfasil&quot; (Tightened, sundered) for 10/9 and 12/11.</p><p>One can see similar explanations in Rauf Yekta, shedding (excuse the<br/>pun) much light into the confusion of the tetrachordal genera of the<br/>Ancient world.</p><p>The tetrachord in question in your response is &quot;mutadil munfasil&quot;,<br/>which is better translated as &quot;Moderate, sundered&quot; - to avoid<br/>confusion with the wholetone disjunction between tetrachords making an<br/>octave.</p><p>&gt; Maqam Huseyni uses another permutation of this same tetrachord of<br/>&gt; some interest for recent Turkish music theory and its political<br/>&gt; vicissitudes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Rast                        Rast<br/>&gt;    |--------------------|......|----------------------|<br/>&gt;  dugah  segah chargah  neva huseyni  evdj gerdaniye muhayyer<br/>&gt;    C#     Eb     E      F#     G#      Bb    B       C#<br/>&gt;   0.0   161.7  288.3  495.7   704.3  866.0 992.6   1200.0<br/>&gt; ~ 1/1   56/51  13/11   4/3     3/2   33/20 39/22     2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here the tetrachords of 161.7-288.3-495.7 cents are close to the<br/>&gt; Huseyni genus of 11:10-320:297-9:8 (165.0-129.1-203.9 cents) or<br/>&gt; 1/1-11/10-32/27-4/3 suggested by Suphi Ezgi in 1933.

I have found out that my memory is lately<br/>&gt;&gt; chuck full of useless everyday political dilly-dallying and I<br/>&gt;&gt; cannot recollect which maqam was transformed how in what<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning. It would be prudent, I believe, for you to categorize<br/>&gt;&gt; the maqams we have elaborated so far in one concise master<br/>&gt;&gt; article, comprising your theoretical constructs (including some<br/>&gt;&gt; of my interpretations and commentary maybe?) in their<br/>&gt;&gt; respective tunings and how they evolved thus in succinct steps<br/>&gt;&gt; (using cent values with dot zero decimals for quick SCALA<br/>&gt;&gt; access too).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an excellent proposal! Indeed, Inshallah, it should be my<br/>&gt; next step after finishing my Zalzalian 12 articles. I realize, in<br/>&gt; fact, that the kind of concise guide to some main maqamat that<br/>&gt; you describe could be a helpful guide to the Zalzalian 12<br/>&gt; articles. And the discussion of Yarman-79/80 tunings for some of<br/>&gt; the principal maqamat in your thesis is one fine model for such<br/>&gt; an article regarding O3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another complication of something like the Zalzalian 12 articles<br/>&gt; is that such a 12-note set may invite one to come up with<br/>&gt; &quot;variations&quot; on maqamat where one or more usual steps are missing<br/>&gt; or out of place by a comma, say. This can be a creative process,<br/>&gt; but perhaps easier to follow if the reader were first familiar<br/>&gt; with the usual forms of such maqamat. Thus it becomes especially<br/>&gt; helpful to know &quot;which maqam was transformed how,&quot; as you put it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The more I think about it, the more attractive a model the<br/>&gt; presentation in your thesis becomes.<br/>&gt;</p><p>One could perhaps organize this article in a database application such<br/>as Excel or Numbers. That would tidy things up a bit with interactive<br/>links for what goes where and which came whence.</p><p>&gt; Since this may be our first discussion of O3, maybe I should try<br/>&gt; my hand at a draft of the article we are discussing, share it<br/>&gt; with you by private e-mail, and then add any commentary you might<br/>&gt; offer for the version for this list, as well as any relevant<br/>&gt; interpretations or commentary from earlier discussions you might<br/>&gt; suggest.</p><p>That&apos;s a notion. In the case of a Spreadsheet, one could variate the<br/>tunings by a drop-down menu to observe the effect instantaneously. Of<br/>course, some good folk from the list - who know Excel or Numbers much better than I - might be willing to assist?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And your idea, when using rounded cents, to give dot zero<br/>&gt; decimals for Scala access is an excellent one I will follow!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The lengthy exegesis of makamlar in your messages requires much<br/>&gt;&gt; deeper deliberation that I can reflect to my response<br/>&gt;&gt; here. Nevertheless, let me say that Rotation 1 (13/12) Maqam<br/>&gt;&gt; Segah hits the spot very well. I also like the Rast flavour<br/>&gt;&gt; with 8/7 as perde dugah instead of the equivalent or<br/>&gt;&gt; approximation of 9/8. Yet, I feel Penchgah-i Hagar (with so low<br/>&gt;&gt; a segah and hijaz) has left the realm of Penchgah and entered<br/>&gt;&gt; that of Nihavend. Maybe one could rename it &quot;Penchgah fi<br/>&gt;&gt; Nihavend-i Hagar&quot; (Penchgah within Nihavend of Hagar). More<br/>&gt;&gt; fittingly so, since Nihavend exhibits more the Hijaz upper<br/>&gt;&gt; tetrachord you seek compared to Penchgah, which almost never<br/>&gt;&gt; shows it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As to Penchgah fi Nihavend-i Hagar, I absolutely agree that this<br/>&gt; is quite different from Penchgah, and belongs to a different<br/>&gt; realm. And if your ear deems it to fit the name of Nihavend, I<br/>&gt; will gladly accept your judgment. As I realized when seeking for<br/>&gt; a name, &quot;Penchgah&quot; in this context means simply &quot;with a step at<br/>&gt; around a 9:8 above perde segah.&quot; Your name ingeniously expresses<br/>&gt; the situation very nicely! May I add that the realm of Penchgah<br/>&gt; with segah at 26/21 is most delightful, with the simple form<br/>&gt; available on a single 12-note keyboard:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              Penchgah                   Rast<br/>&gt;    |---------------------------|-------------------|<br/>&gt;  rast   dugah  segah   hijaz  neva huseyni  evdj gerdaniye<br/>&gt;    B      C#     Eb      F     F#     G#     Bb    B<br/>&gt;    0    207.4  369.1   576.6 703.1  911.7 1073.4 1200.0<br/>&gt; ~ 1/1   44/39  26/21   88/63   3/2  22/13  13/7   2/1<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, this is a very good Penchgah scale. What it needs is the<br/>occasional 4/3, or perde chargah for alterations.</p><p>&gt; And I must agree, even as a newcomer not acquainted with the<br/>&gt; nuances of the seyir for Penchgah and its common modulations,<br/>&gt; that I would not think of an upper Hijaz -- quite unlike Penchgah<br/>&gt; fi Nihavend-i Hagar, where it is a usual part of the seyir.<br/>&gt; And it might be said that while the steps or perde-s form the<br/>&gt; frame or skeleton of a maqam, the seyir is the flesh and blood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Shur and Najdi are hard to come by in Turkish circles to my<br/>&gt;&gt; knowledge, so I make no further commentary on those.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With Shur, it is interesting that Turkish performers sometimes<br/>&gt; play a very low or septimal Ushshaq, if we may take as an example<br/>&gt; the performance of &quot;a venerable Turkish Neyzen&quot; or _Niyazi<br/>&gt; Sayin_. as you explain in your thesis at pp. 27-29. Here I quote<br/>&gt; your measured steps for this __Niyazi Sayin Ushshak Ney_ Taksim<br/>&gt; and JI values, plus an approximation in O3 (full 24 notes):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Niyazi Sayin Ushshak Ney Taksim:  123.47    137.13     227.87<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI:                               128.30    138.57     231.17<br/>&gt;                                    14:13     13:12       8:7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; O3:                               126.56    138.28     230.86<br/>&gt;</p><p>Good comparisons. The whole point being not only to approximate the<br/>middle seconds anymore of course ... But to supply the listener with<br/>the benefits of enriched harmony through a clever tuning &amp; temperament!</p><p>&gt; However, while either this low flavor of Ushshaq or a similar<br/>&gt; flavor of Shur might suggest a medieval 28:26:24:21, Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>&gt; famous tetrachord or a permutation of it (if 12:13:14:16 is his<br/>&gt; actual form), the seyir of Ushshaq would, of course, differ from<br/>&gt; that of Shur Dastgah.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I am not sure if Najdi is very common in the Arab world,<br/>&gt; although it is mentioned by theorists such as Amine Beyhom. One<br/>&gt; might actually think of it as two conjunct Rast tetrachords plus<br/>&gt; a _lower_ tone. In a typical Arab intonation as realized in O3,<br/>&gt; perde segah (or, in Arabic, sikah) might be at 357.4 or 358.6<br/>&gt; cents, close to Jacques Dudon&apos;s 59/48 or the 16/13 of Yarman-24.<br/>&gt; To play Nadji with segah at around 26/21 is really taking an Arab<br/>&gt; maqam and applying an Ottoman intonation, I would guess.<br/>&gt;</p><p>One of many possibilities most welcome in the pursuit of refined music-<br/>making no doubt!</p><p>&gt;&gt; And at long last, Buzurg once more. Just a minor interjection<br/>&gt;&gt; on my part: It is my impression, based on no solid evidence<br/>&gt;&gt; except erudite conjecture, that Buzurg is supposed to be an<br/>&gt;&gt; ascending/descending:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 14/13<br/>&gt;&gt; 16/13<br/>&gt;&gt; 56/39<br/>&gt;&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An interesting point is the steps of 14:13-8:7-7:6-117:112<br/>&gt; (128.3-231.2-266.9-75.6 cents). The adjacent 8:7 and 7:6 steps in<br/>&gt; the middle lead me to ask if these steps occur together, thus in<br/>&gt; effect dividing 4:3 into a trichord of 8:7:6, in other maqamat.<br/>&gt; I need to try playing this and seeing where it takes me, but your<br/>&gt; erudite intuition is indeed to be carefully considered.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, there is 4:3 between the adjacent 8:7 and 7:6. There is no<br/>interruption in ascent or descent of the given scale. But this is a<br/>very peculiar and little-trodden domain! One can seldom see this kind<br/>of thing in a double-Segah instance seperated by a fifth: a &quot;segah-<br/>chargah-segah-kurdi-rast-kurdi-segah&quot; pattern repeated 3:2 above with the addition of perde chargah and neva in ascent up to there. I<br/>noticed the full pentachord more pronounced in the seyir of Ferahnak<br/>than anywhere else; hence the name.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In one thematic version and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 14/13<br/>&gt;&gt; 16/13<br/>&gt;&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt;&gt; 56/39<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; diminished pentachord in another ascending/descending cadential<br/>&gt;&gt; version. I don&apos;t remember if I had mentioned this, but there it<br/>&gt;&gt; is.  The latter is akin to what I dub the &quot;Ferahnak<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachord&quot;.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Errata: I meant &quot;the former is akin to the Ferahnak Pentachord&quot;. Not<br/>the diminished one, which is already defined in theory.</p><p>&gt; Looking at a few page on the web about Makam Ferahnak, I see some<br/>&gt; parallels, and some with a maqam we were previously discussing<br/>&gt; (see below). It is curious that I found a descending seyir with<br/>&gt; this pentachord through an analogy with Shur Dastgah, where the<br/>&gt; fifth is often lowered by a koron, or often about 1/3 tone, in<br/>&gt; descending.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You should indeed educate me more on Ferahnak. and how you<br/>&gt; interpret the intonation and the seyir. What I will quickly<br/>&gt; mention here is a version on the web from Ezgi where, if I take<br/>&gt; the signs of S and K (lesser and greater mujannab) as around<br/>&gt; 14/13 and 11/10, the maqam seems very similar to our Penchgah fi<br/>&gt; Nihavend-i Hagar. Here I will use O3 pitches:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               Ferahnak                 Hijaz<br/>&gt;     |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>&gt;     Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B      D    Eb<br/>&gt;     0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1119.1 1200.0<br/>&gt;       S       T      T      K     S     A      B<br/>&gt;     126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 288.3   81.9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And what I take to be a descending form, reminding me of your<br/>&gt; suggestion for Nihavend that the descending seventh degree should<br/>&gt; form a perfect fifth with the third step of the lower tetrachord,<br/>&gt; here C#-G#:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               Ferahnak                Segah<br/>&gt;     |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>&gt;     Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B    C#     Eb<br/>&gt;     0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1038.3 1200.0<br/>&gt;       S       T      T      K     S     T      K<br/>&gt;     126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 207.4  161.7<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very good so far. But always have in spare the diminished Ferahnak<br/>pentachord on the finalis. Without that (and possibly my Ferahnak<br/>pentachord as well) the seyir will be incomplete. Also, preserve the<br/>Eb-Ab perfect fourth, which is a must for the correct tuning.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This construct is amiss in theoretical and historical<br/>&gt;&gt; explanations of makamlar, but chanced - even if rarely - in<br/>&gt;&gt; performances if my scrutiny is to be trusted. Ah, but I see<br/>&gt;&gt; that the intiguing descending Segah upper region in your third<br/>&gt;&gt; e-mail features this very Ferahnak pentachord as well as the<br/>&gt;&gt; already-known diminished Ferahnak pentachord mixed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is curious that I looked up Ferahnak on Google, recognized the<br/>&gt; similarity with a variation on Penchgah fi Nihavend-i Hagar, and<br/>&gt; then came to your similar recognition in the next paragraph! (I<br/>&gt; read this paragraph earlier, but had yet checked my earlier post<br/>&gt; to see exactly which ajnas (genera) you were referring to here,<br/>&gt; evidently the Segah variations at the end of my Part 3 on the<br/>&gt; Zalzalian 12 set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One thing I did not have available in the Zalzalian 12 set,<br/>&gt; although it is available on a single 12-note keyboard, is a<br/>&gt; seventh at 20/11 or 51/28, here more the latter at 1038.3 cents,<br/>&gt; in that rotation.  And I might say that the lower pentachord<br/>&gt; found in both of Ezgi&apos;s forms of Ferahnak, and also Penchgah fi<br/>&gt; Nihavend-i Hagar, is related to a 1/1-14/13-40/33-4/3 flavor of<br/>&gt; Segah or the like rather as Makam Penchgah is to Rast (with segah<br/>&gt; at around 26/21).</p><p>So you have discovered once more the subtleties of the nuances of<br/>pitch that differentiate maqams seperated only by the berth of an<br/>acoustical blot!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Returning to Buzurg, the difference I&apos;d see is that the latter<br/>&gt; has a semitone below the fifth, or acting as a kind of lowered<br/>&gt; fifth, at around 56/39; while in Ferahnak we have a step maybe<br/>&gt; not too much higher than 15/11, here 542.6 cents. But I agree<br/>&gt; it&apos;s intriguing how the descending Segah region in Part 3 of my<br/>&gt; Zalzalian 12 series of articles brings into play the 56/39 also<br/>&gt; found in Buzurg, and thus the Ferahnak ajnas you are discussing.<br/>&gt;</p><p>543 cents cannot be allowed for maqam Ferahnak, the perfect fourth<br/>must be present at all times.</p><p>&gt;&gt; About the upper &quot;Buzurg tetrachord&quot;, I imagine it would be<br/>&gt;&gt; judicious to say Hijaz-i Buzurg to punctuate the Hijaz sphere<br/>&gt;&gt; of influence here.  We see such denominations as Hijaz-i<br/>&gt;&gt; Muhalif, Hijaz-i Turki, etc... to categorize maqam savours<br/>&gt;&gt; centering on Hijaz in historical sources, so, why not scale<br/>&gt;&gt; structures themselves?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly an upper tetrachord of 1/1-14/13-16/13-4/3, or in the<br/>&gt; example from O3, 0.0-126.6-357.4-495.7 cents, could fit with one<br/>&gt; flavor of Turkish Hijaz: Hijaz-i Buzurg might be exactly right!<br/>&gt; And in the world of Iranian music, one might call this Avaz-e<br/>&gt; Bayat-e Esfahan-e Buzurg (if so many possessives are admissible),<br/>&gt; or simply Esfahan-e Buzurg, to distinguish it from various other<br/>&gt; flavors of Esfahan. Farhat gives Esfahan, if one applies his tar<br/>&gt; tuning to his notation, as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             D    Ep     F&gt;     G<br/>&gt;            0.0  135.0  360.0  495.0<br/>&gt;              135.0  225.0  135.0<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, Hijaz-e Muhalif reminds me of the Persian Mokhalef,<br/>&gt; another topic (and rather like one flavor of Esfahan)! I&apos;d love<br/>&gt; to learn more about Hijaz-i Muhalif.</p><p>I recall it was mentioned by Nasir Dede, but I have to check that<br/>later when an oppurtune moment arrives.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So far, I liked the Buzurg variants you delineated. Good show!<br/>&gt;&gt; The possibilities of fine intonation with the O3 type tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; demonstrates clearly how our clich?? notions of trying to keep<br/>&gt;&gt; segah close to 5/4 is much misguided. It has been lately my<br/>&gt;&gt; inclination to focus on 370 cents or so as the nominal spot for<br/>&gt;&gt; perde segah in most (and perhaps all) instances in keeping with<br/>&gt;&gt; historicity of maqam theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed O3 is designed to place perde segah at around 370 cents in<br/>&gt; order to optimize the kind of historical Ottoman flavor we are<br/>&gt; discussing. And it&apos;s fascinating how Safi al-Din al-Urmavi&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Medium disjunct&quot;</p><p>Moderate, sundered. :)</p><p>&gt; tetrachord of 9:8-11:10-320:297, or Ezgi&apos;s<br/>&gt; rotation of this for Huseyni in 1933, so nicely fits with this<br/>&gt; placement of rast-segah at around 26/21.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Most cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best, with warmest thanks to Dr. Arslan also,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m forwarding this to him as BCC.

Monz would surely recognize with<br/>&gt;  satisfaction that one proper translation of the former term is his<br/>&gt;  proposed adjective &quot;relaxed&quot;.</p><p>This would suggest that Leyyin or &quot;relaxed&quot; would apply to a<br/>tetrachord with a largest interval somewhere near 7:6 or greater, with<br/>a hemifourth around 15:13 or so on the border between Leyyin and Qawi.</p><p>&gt;  Indeed, &quot;Leyyin&quot; is Arabic for &quot;soft, softened, light, gentle,<br/>&gt;  easy-going, mild, mellow, smooth, creamy, etc...&quot; and is obviously<br/>&gt;  the chosen equivalent of the Greek word &quot;Malakon&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Qawi&quot;<br/>&gt;  means &quot;sturdy, rigid, firm, tenacious, resistant, strong, powerful,<br/>&gt;  safe, secure, trustworthy, well-supplied, propertied etc...&quot; some<br/>&gt;  of which correspond justly to the Greek word &quot;Syntonon&quot;<br/>&gt;  (strained). I feel Monz&apos; proposed &quot;tense&quot; might not be the best<br/>&gt;  translation for the Arabic term compared to &quot;firm&quot; here.</p><p>Possibly there is a certain analogy here with the Latin terms _molle_<br/>for Bb and _durum_ for B-natural, which could be translated as &quot;soft&quot;<br/>and &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;strong.&quot; Your &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;firm&quot; seem agreeable to me.</p><p>&gt;  In the same &quot;esprit&quot;, Rauf Yekta translates Leyyin as &quot;mou&quot; (soft)<br/>&gt;  and Qawi as &quot;fort&quot; (strong) in the section devoted to his monograph<br/>&gt;  in Encyclop??die de la musique et dictionnaire du Conservatoire<br/>&gt;  (p. 2990):<br/>   -------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;  L&apos;ensemble de trois intervalles ordonn??s dans une quarte s&apos;appelle<br/>&gt;  ?? genre ??

Il y a diff??rents genres.

Le genre normal (RASIM).<br/>&gt;  2?? Le genre chromatique (LEVNI).<br/>&gt;  3?? Le genre ordonnateur (NAZIM).<br/>   -----------------------------------------------------</p><p>[... other interesting material ]</p><p>&gt; Those tetrachords that employ 5:4 as the largest interval among<br/>&gt; three are called RASIM,</p><p>&gt; Those tetrachords that employ 6:5 as the largest interval among<br/>&gt; three are called LEVNI,</p><p>&gt; Those tetrachords that employ 7:6 as the largest interval among<br/>&gt; three are called NAZIM.</p><p>&gt;  Yekta has translated RASIM (that which draws or flows through) as<br/>&gt;  normal, LEVNI (that which cascades in colours) as chromatic, and<br/>&gt;  NAZIM (arranging one after the other) as organizing.  These<br/>&gt;  translations do fairness to the Arabic originals, which insooth<br/>&gt;  stand for the famous &quot;Diatonic&quot;, &quot;Chromatic&quot; and &quot;Enharmonic&quot;<br/>&gt;  genera respectively.</p><p>A curious thing is that I might have guessed that a largest interval<br/>of 5:4 would be enharmonic or Nazim; and a largest interval of 6:5 or<br/>7:6 would be chromatic or Levni, as with Qutb al-Din&apos;s Hijaz; while a<br/>largest interval or around 15:13 or smaller (e.g. 8:7 or 9:8) would be<br/>diatonic Rasim.</p><p>An especially interesting point is that 6:5 and 7:6 are in different<br/>categories, a distinction which might fit with that in modern Ottoman<br/>theory between Nihavend (e.g. 9-5-8 commas) and Buselik (e.g. 9-3-10<br/>commas in a septimal flavor). From a Greek perspective, I might guess<br/>that both could be regarded as characteristic of a chromatic genus<br/>with a semiditone or minor third and two semitone steps, as with<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s Soft Chromatic at 1/1-28/27-10/9-4/3 or 28:27-15:14-6:5, and<br/>his Firm Chromatic at 1/1-22/21-8/7-4/3 or 22:21-12:11-7:6.</p><p>&gt;  Following table after table of permutations, Urmevi shows a new<br/>&gt;  method, where he uses the same interval ratio twice in a<br/>&gt;  tetrachord. A pair of 8/7s makes the tetrachord &quot;qawi zu al-taz&apos;eef<br/>&gt;  fi al-awwal&quot; (the first paired of the FIRM genus); a pair of 9/8s<br/>&gt;  makes the tetrachord &quot;zu al-taz&apos;eef fi al-thani&quot; (the second<br/>&gt;  paired); a pair of 10/9s makes the tetrachord &quot;zu al-taz&apos;eef fi<br/>&gt;  al-thalith&quot; (the third paired).</p><p>In passing I might mention that Curt Sachs documented a medieval<br/>European source mentioning the 8:7-8:7-49:48 tetrachord.</p><p>&gt;  Yet another operation for finding new tetrachords for Urmavi is<br/>&gt;  taking a pair of sequential superparticular ratios.  Safi al-din<br/>&gt;  pairs a 8/7 and 9/8 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil al-Awwal&quot; (the first<br/>&gt;  conjoined); a 9/8 and 10/9 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil al-Awsat&quot; (the<br/>&gt;  middle conjoined); a 10/9 and 11/10 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil<br/>&gt;  al-Thalith&quot; (the third conjoined).  The same operation where one<br/>&gt;  diminishing superparticular ratio is skipped yields &quot;qawi munfasil&quot;<br/>&gt;  (Firm, sundered) for 8/7 and 10/9; &quot;mutadil munfasil&quot; (Moderate,<br/>&gt;  sundered) for 9/8 and 11/10; and &quot;Shedd munfasil&quot; (Tightened,<br/>&gt;  sundered) for 10/9 and 12/11.</p><p>Here I notice that all the ratios in question are 8/7 or smaller,<br/>which would fit with my usual concept of a &quot;diatonic&quot; genus.</p><p>&gt;  One can see similar explanations in Rauf Yekta, shedding (excuse<br/>&gt;  the pun) much light into the confusion of the tetrachordal genera<br/>&gt;  of the Ancient world.</p><p>While I have not quoted every line of your post, I would emphasize<br/>that every line is well worth study!</p><p>&gt;  The tetrachord in question in your response is &quot;mutadil munfasil&quot;,<br/>&gt;  which is better translated as &quot;Moderate, sundered&quot; - to avoid<br/>&gt;  confusion with the wholetone disjunction between tetrachords making<br/>&gt;  an octave.</p><p>Yes, I agree that this is a fitting English translation!</p><p>[On coming article outlining some basic maqamat and O3 tunings]</p><p>&gt;  One could perhaps organize this article in a database application<br/>&gt;  such as Excel or Numbers.

In the case of a Spreadsheet, one could variate<br/>&gt;  the tunings by a drop-down menu to observe the effect<br/>&gt;  instantaneously.

What it needs is the<br/>&gt; occasional 4/3, or perde chargah for alterations.</p><p>Intuitively I suspected that a 4/3 at perde chargah might occur, in<br/>part on the basis of looking at a few pieces in Penchgah available on<br/>the web. However, I must admit that when I start polyphonizing in<br/>Penchgah, the results are influenced mainly by 14th-century European<br/>patterns, which this maqam seems to fit so nicely in a Zalzalian<br/>variation, as it were! Understanding the typical Ottoman seyir might<br/>give me a fuller perspective.</p><p>&gt;  With Shur, it is interesting that Turkish performers sometimes<br/>&gt;  play a very low or septimal Ushshaq, if we may take as an example<br/>&gt;  the performance of &quot;a venerable Turkish Neyzen&quot; or _Niyazi<br/>&gt;  Sayin_. as you explain in your thesis at pp. 27-29.

The whole point being not only to approximate the<br/>&gt;  middle seconds anymore of course ... But to supply the listener<br/>&gt;  with the benefits of enriched harmony through a clever tuning &amp;<br/>&gt;  temperament!</p><p>I much agree. What George Secor and I found is that harmonic or<br/>polyphonic progressions involving middle second steps can have a<br/>special beauty.</p><p>[On Buzurg]</p><p>&gt;&gt;  An interesting point is the steps of 14:13-8:7-7:6-117:112<br/>&gt;&gt; (128.3-231.2-266.9-75.6 cents). The adjacent 8:7 and 7:6 steps in<br/>&gt;&gt; the middle lead me to ask if these steps occur together, thus in<br/>&gt;&gt; effect dividing 4:3 into a trichord of 8:7:6, in other maqamat.  I<br/>&gt;&gt; need to try playing this and seeing where it takes me, but your<br/>&gt;&gt; erudite intuition is indeed to be carefully considered.</p><p>&gt;   Yes, there is 4:3 between the adjacent 8:7 and 7:6. There is no<br/>&gt;   interruption in ascent or descent of the given scale.  But this is<br/>&gt;   a very peculiar and little-trodden domain! One can seldom see this<br/>&gt;   kind of thing in a double-Segah instance seperated by a fifth: a<br/>&gt;   &quot;segah-chargah-segah-kurdi-rast-kurdi-segah&quot; pattern repeated 3:2<br/>&gt;   above with the addition of perde chargah and neva in ascent up to<br/>&gt;   there. I noticed the full pentachord more pronounced in the seyir<br/>&gt;   of Ferahnak than anywhere else; hence the name.</p><p>Certainly this interpretation of Buzurg as 1/1-14/13-16/13-56/39-3/2<br/>seems &quot;very peculiar and little trodden&quot; to me also! But as to the<br/>double Segah instance, I am trying to understand this as possibly<br/>something like the following, where I have indicated the pitches in<br/>cents with respect both to rast, the first cardinal point as it were<br/>on the compass of the maqamat, and also segah:</p><p>        segah  chargah  segah kurdi rast kurdi segah chargah neva rast:    370    497     370   289    0   289    370   497    704<br/>         Bb      B       Bb    A     F#   A     Bb     B      C#<br/>segah:   0      127      0    1119  830  1119   0     127    334</p><p>        evjd  gerdaniye evjd  ajem  neva ajem  evdj rast:   1073   1200     1073  993   704  993   1073<br/>          F      F#      F     E     C#   E     F<br/>segah:   703    830     703   622   334  622   703</p><p>In Maqam Segah, I would take rast-kurdi-segah as what the Arabs call a<br/>_dint_ or semitone, here kurdi-segah, leading up to an important step<br/>of a maqam such here the final or tonic; and I have read of this in<br/>Signell&apos;s _Makam_. Thus perde dugah, the usual step below segah, is<br/>altered to kurdi, and from there a semitone up to segah.</p><p>And I see how, from this &quot;double Segah,&quot; we can get a pentachord<br/>0-127-334-622-703, rather like your 0-128-359-622-702 as one<br/>interpretation of Buzurg.</p><p>But reading again your comments, I must ask: is this &quot;double segah&quot; a<br/>form of Maqam Segah, or Maqam Ferahnak?</p><p>&gt;    In one thematic version and<br/>&gt;    14/13<br/>&gt;    16/13<br/>&gt;    4/3<br/>&gt;    56/39<br/>&gt;    diminished pentachord in another ascending/descending cadential<br/>&gt;    version. I don&apos;t remember if I had mentioned this, but there it<br/>&gt;    is.  The latter is akin to what I dub the &quot;Ferahnak<br/>&gt;    pentachord&quot;.</p><p>&gt;  Errata: I meant &quot;the former is akin to the Ferahnak<br/>&gt;  Pentachord&quot;. Not the diminished one, which is already defined in<br/>&gt;  theory.</p><p>This correction I will note!</p><p>Now comes our discussion of Ferahnak, which raises a problem which I<br/>can solve in O3, but imperfectly! To solve it more convincingly, I<br/>would need chains of fifths at least 12 fifths long, as would happen<br/>in a system based on two 17-MOS chains. Let us see my dilemma,<br/>starting with my quotation of Ferahnak according to Suphi Ezgi, and<br/>taking his two versions to be the ascending and descending forms:</p><p>                 Ferahnak                 Hijaz<br/>       |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>       Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B      D    Eb<br/>       0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1119.1 1200.0<br/>         S       T      T      K     S     A      B<br/>       126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 288.3   81.9</p><p>                 Ferahnak                Segah<br/>       |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>       Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B    C#     Eb<br/>       0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1038.3 1200.0<br/>         S       T      T      K     S     T      K<br/>       126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 207.4  161.7</p><p>&gt;  Very good so far. But always have in spare the diminished Ferahnak<br/>&gt;  pentachord on the finalis. Without that (and possibly my Ferahnak<br/>&gt;  pentachord as well) the seyir will be incomplete. Also, preserve<br/>&gt;  the Eb-Ab perfect fourth, which is a must for the correct tuning.</p><p>This advice points to a glaring flaw in the O3 system, if we wish to<br/>have available both Ezgi&apos;s pentachord of S-T-T-K at Eb-E-F#-G#-Bb. and<br/>a 4/3 step: the absence of a true Ab for a 4/3 step above Eb on either<br/>12-note keyboard, which has a chain of only 11 fifths, Eb-G#!</p><p>And I should note a question that comes up later in this reply: is a<br/>step at 543 cents permissible at any point in the seyir of Maqam<br/>Ferahnak, or must the fourth step always remain within about a comma<br/>of 4/3, as it woold with Ezgi&apos;s S-T-T-K at 5-9-9=8 commas in AEU, but<br/>not in O3? If in fact the O3 version of S-T-T-K does not fit Ferahnak,<br/>then the following tuning set would nicely provide all of the other<br/>ajnas you describe, including the &quot;double segah,&quot; if I am correct.

If 543 cents &quot;cannot be allowed&quot; at any point in the seyir,<br/>although the 522 cents of AEU is sometimes permissible, could this be<br/>because the fourth step may be up to about a comma wide, but not wider<br/>to the point where it it is no longer recognizable as any kind of<br/>&quot;perfect fourth,&quot; but becomes a Zalzalian interval more like 11/8?</p><p>If so, a lesson would be that a given jins often, but not always, will<br/>translate successfully from AEU to the &quot;moderate, sundered&quot; style of<br/>intonation in O3, based on rast-segah at around 26/21, with S-T-T-K of<br/>Maqam Ferahnak as an example correct in AEU but not O3.

All<br/>of these ajnas except S-T-T-K are available with the final of Ferahnak<br/>at Bb or Bb*, where a regular 4/3 at 496 cents is available without<br/>any problem!

Having<br/>found a much amiss peace-space in the tuning list (which has been<br/>vandalized to the point of utter uselessness in my view as you can<br/>glean from my latest criticisms), I wish to concentrate a final time<br/>to respond to you before engaging those urgently pressing academic<br/>tasks that await my attention here for the following two months or so.</p><p>Before all else, let me iterate that my comments on the correct tuning<br/>of maqam scales are my own opinions and must be taken with a grain of<br/>salt! More so, since I have lost track of many particulars of the<br/>maqam traditions in my gross (and sadly, obsessive) involvement for<br/>the past weeks with a shaky software overhaul operation in my Macbook<br/>Pro that still tugs at a corner of my mind.</p><p>Bear in mind also, that the devastating penetration of the 12-equal<br/>parlance and acclimatization into our native music culture has<br/>resulted in so many pitch distortions that it has become very hard to<br/>chance upon a truly authentic performance nowadays! I cannot shy away<br/>from admitting that getting drawn into the daily video and music links<br/>filling my mailbox and newsfeed network has somewhat disrupted my<br/>purist enjoyment of authentic Maqam traditions. There is also the<br/>socio-political air of human corruption that eats away at our very<br/>souls and moral beliefs in this day and age. I undertake to write to<br/>you at a period of intense weariness (plus some health issues it<br/>appears) and ask pardon if I miss any pertinent points you made.</p><p>Aside from nodding my head as I skim through your comments on the<br/>largest intervals in Rasim, Levni and Nazim types of tetrachords, I am<br/>intrigued by the European source that is reported as mentioning the<br/>&quot;paired tetrachord&quot; involving two 8:7s.</p><p>This brings to mind once again possibilities on the direct connection<br/>between the Islamic world (the &quot;Mutazilah Era&quot; as you pleasingly<br/>state) and Christendom during the &quot;Middle Ages&quot;; especially given the<br/>much overlooked contributions and scientific innovations of such<br/>towering Muslim intellects as Abu&apos;l Hasan a.k.a. &quot;Ziryab&quot;, al-Kindi,<br/>al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, Ibn al-Haytham, Jabir bin Hayyan, al-Biruni, Omar<br/>Khayyam, al-Khwarizmi, Nasraddin al-Tusi, Qutbaddin Shirazi, ibn<br/>Rushd... From what I know, the Carolingian Era was set in motion with<br/>the Andalusian and Moroccan Muslim culture, arts and sciences seeping<br/>into Europe over the Baghdadi Darulhikmah centre &gt; Egyptian Al-Azhar<br/>mosque &gt; Tunisian Zeytune mosque &gt; Moroccan Qarawiyin mosque &gt; Cordoba.</p><p>I noticed with dismay that many &quot;tunaniks&quot; (as Charles Lucy puts it)<br/>have preferred to pursue inane arguments of no consequence so far<br/>instead of offering to assist you toward the more constructive<br/>endeavour of preparing an MS Excel document that would demonstrate the<br/>myriad maqam tunings you have formulated up to now. There is still a<br/>chance they will remember their roots and make themselves more useful<br/>than nowadays perhaps!</p><p>Once again I nod as I read your interpretation of what I termed the<br/>&quot;double Segah&quot; phenomenon. The cent values seem quite right for the purpose. To make the transition from Segah on segah to Segah on evdj,<br/>one needs a perde huseyni at about 27/16 between the two seyirs you<br/>notated. And indeed, there it is: the Ferahnak pentachord of mine (not<br/>Buzurg) when you climb segah+chargah+neva+ajem+evdj (0-128-359-622-702<br/>cents).</p><p>Yes, you rightfully ask me whether this is a feature of Segah or<br/>Ferahnak. More that of Segah I must say! But there is already one<br/>tetrachord and a whole PLUS a diminished pentachord ascribed to Segah<br/>already; none of which is the pentachord we seek. Though surely a rare<br/>thing to chance in Ferahnak, 0-128-359-622-702 serves our purposes and<br/>helps us avoid some confusion when we call it the &quot;Ferahnak pentachord&quot;.</p><p>A step of 543 cents in</p><p>126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1119.1 1200.0</p><p>could of course be admissable if you allow room for flexibility of<br/>intonation without any qualms about offending indoctrinated old school<br/>people out there. In fact, it could be neatly camouflaged to give the<br/>impression of a perfect fourth if you compose to avoid direct fourth<br/>jumps in the melody line. But we are not just talking monophony, are<br/>we? So, the desired Zalzalian effect requires at least a comma<br/>deviation from the pure fourth up, which will surely be needed in<br/>another F#-G-A-B-C# AEU Ferahnak pentachord shade (however rare) even<br/>in monophony. (This also answers your inquiry about how that pure fourth above the tonic F# in the preceding example can turn a comma<br/>higher than advertised: C# in the whole AEU Ferahnak pentachord pulls<br/>it up.)</p><p>Note elsewhere, that you cannot ordinarily have kurdi -81 cents from<br/>perde segah. If I must name it, that pitch would serve better as perde<br/>nihavend, which is about a comma higher than kurdi.</p><p>I&apos;d suggest taking care when manipulating to install a maqam setting<br/>at a particular key and forgetting about how the rest will fall in<br/>place in the same Ahenk. One must remember that setting Ferahnak&apos;s<br/>finalis on Eb means Segah&apos;s is at Ab, Rast&apos;s at E, Huseyni&apos;s at F#,<br/>etc... This is one of the most troublesome features of Maqam music,<br/>which was one chief reason that lead me to design the 79-tone qanun.</p><p>I checked Nasir Dede on Hijaz-i Muhalif, which is nothing other than<br/>Hijaz-Ashiran. You start with Hijaz and conclude with Ashiran (just<br/>Huseyni transposed to perde ashiran, a fourth below dugah). It seems<br/>to have nothing to do with the Persian Mukhalif.</p><p>I have read the rest on the Zalzalian rotations and have no more to<br/>comment on them, except pronounce my thanks for mentioning my name in<br/>such positive and encouraging light!</p><p>And Margo, I believe you must always endeavour to produce more<br/>glorified musical examples and pieces in the Mutazili, Zalzalian<br/>polyphonic manner! :)</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Sep 7, 2010, at 9:37 PM, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;  You are very kind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   First of all, a big thank you for your kind words and<br/>&gt;&gt;   praises.

And from your comment below that Maqam<br/>&gt; Ferahnak also must &quot;at all times&quot; have a perfect fourth, I might<br/>&gt; conclude that this Maqam also must have its final or tonic on Bb<br/>&gt; rather than Eb, as discussed below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &lt;<a href="http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/The__Theory_of_Music.pdf">http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/The__Theory_of_Music.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Frankly, I do not think Fazli chose the best English wording here<br/>&gt;&gt; for the Arabic originals. Rauf Yekta had suggested as early as 1922<br/>&gt;&gt; the correct wordings in French of those terms adopted by early<br/>&gt;&gt; Islamic theorists from Hellenistic literature. Let me recapitulate<br/>&gt;&gt; them here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is fascinating to get the benefit of Yekta&apos;s translations into the<br/>&gt; language which humorously reminds me of the term Alla Franca, although<br/>&gt; his purpose was, of course, Alla Turca! And I wonder if he had in mind<br/>&gt; Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi when he made the comment you quote at p. 152 of<br/>&gt; your thesis and n. iii about Turkish music using intervals such 7:6,<br/>&gt; 12:11, and 22:21, since they occur in Qutb al-Din&apos;s classic Hijaz:<br/>&gt; 12:11-7:6-22:21, indeed a permutation of Ptolemy&apos;s firm chromatic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; According to Safi al-din Urmavi in his &quot;Risalat al-Sharafiyyah&quot;, if<br/>&gt;&gt; the largest of three melodic intervals within a tetrachord is<br/>&gt;&gt; greater in size than the sum of the other two, the genus is called<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Leyyin&quot; - if not, &quot;Qawi&quot;. Monz would surely recognize with<br/>&gt;&gt; satisfaction that one proper translation of the former term is his<br/>&gt;&gt; proposed adjective &quot;relaxed&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This would suggest that Leyyin or &quot;relaxed&quot; would apply to a<br/>&gt; tetrachord with a largest interval somewhere near 7:6 or greater, with<br/>&gt; a hemifourth around 15:13 or so on the border between Leyyin and Qawi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Indeed, &quot;Leyyin&quot; is Arabic for &quot;soft, softened, light, gentle,<br/>&gt;&gt; easy-going, mild, mellow, smooth, creamy, etc...&quot; and is obviously<br/>&gt;&gt; the chosen equivalent of the Greek word &quot;Malakon&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Qawi&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; means &quot;sturdy, rigid, firm, tenacious, resistant, strong, powerful,<br/>&gt;&gt; safe, secure, trustworthy, well-supplied, propertied etc...&quot; some<br/>&gt;&gt; of which correspond justly to the Greek word &quot;Syntonon&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; (strained). I feel Monz&apos; proposed &quot;tense&quot; might not be the best<br/>&gt;&gt; translation for the Arabic term compared to &quot;firm&quot; here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Possibly there is a certain analogy here with the Latin terms _molle_<br/>&gt; for Bb and _durum_ for B-natural, which could be translated as &quot;soft&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;strong.&quot; Your &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;firm&quot; seem agreeable to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In the same &quot;esprit&quot;, Rauf Yekta translates Leyyin as &quot;mou&quot; (soft)<br/>&gt;&gt; and Qawi as &quot;fort&quot; (strong) in the section devoted to his monograph<br/>&gt;&gt; in Encyclop??die de la musique et dictionnaire du Conservatoire<br/>&gt;&gt; (p. 2990):<br/>&gt;    -------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;&gt; L&apos;ensemble de trois intervalles ordonn??s dans une quarte s&apos;appelle<br/>&gt;&gt; ?? genre ??

Le genre ordonnateur (NAZIM).<br/>&gt;    -----------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [... other interesting material ]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Those tetrachords that employ 5:4 as the largest interval among<br/>&gt;&gt; three are called RASIM,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Those tetrachords that employ 6:5 as the largest interval among<br/>&gt;&gt; three are called LEVNI,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Those tetrachords that employ 7:6 as the largest interval among<br/>&gt;&gt; three are called NAZIM.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yekta has translated RASIM (that which draws or flows through) as<br/>&gt;&gt; normal, LEVNI (that which cascades in colours) as chromatic, and<br/>&gt;&gt; NAZIM (arranging one after the other) as organizing.  These<br/>&gt;&gt; translations do fairness to the Arabic originals, which insooth<br/>&gt;&gt; stand for the famous &quot;Diatonic&quot;, &quot;Chromatic&quot; and &quot;Enharmonic&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; genera respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A curious thing is that I might have guessed that a largest interval<br/>&gt; of 5:4 would be enharmonic or Nazim; and a largest interval of 6:5 or<br/>&gt; 7:6 would be chromatic or Levni, as with Qutb al-Din&apos;s Hijaz; while a<br/>&gt; largest interval or around 15:13 or smaller (e.g. 8:7 or 9:8) would be<br/>&gt; diatonic Rasim.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An especially interesting point is that 6:5 and 7:6 are in different<br/>&gt; categories, a distinction which might fit with that in modern Ottoman<br/>&gt; theory between Nihavend (e.g. 9-5-8 commas) and Buselik (e.g. 9-3-10<br/>&gt; commas in a septimal flavor). From a Greek perspective, I might guess<br/>&gt; that both could be regarded as characteristic of a chromatic genus<br/>&gt; with a semiditone or minor third and two semitone steps, as with<br/>&gt; Ptolemy&apos;s Soft Chromatic at 1/1-28/27-10/9-4/3 or 28:27-15:14-6:5, and<br/>&gt; his Firm Chromatic at 1/1-22/21-8/7-4/3 or 22:21-12:11-7:6.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Following table after table of permutations, Urmevi shows a new<br/>&gt;&gt; method, where he uses the same interval ratio twice in a<br/>&gt;&gt; tetrachord. A pair of 8/7s makes the tetrachord &quot;qawi zu al-taz&apos;eef<br/>&gt;&gt; fi al-awwal&quot; (the first paired of the FIRM genus); a pair of 9/8s<br/>&gt;&gt; makes the tetrachord &quot;zu al-taz&apos;eef fi al-thani&quot; (the second<br/>&gt;&gt; paired); a pair of 10/9s makes the tetrachord &quot;zu al-taz&apos;eef fi<br/>&gt;&gt; al-thalith&quot; (the third paired).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In passing I might mention that Curt Sachs documented a medieval<br/>&gt; European source mentioning the 8:7-8:7-49:48 tetrachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yet another operation for finding new tetrachords for Urmavi is<br/>&gt;&gt; taking a pair of sequential superparticular ratios.  Safi al-din<br/>&gt;&gt; pairs a 8/7 and 9/8 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil al-Awwal&quot; (the first<br/>&gt;&gt; conjoined); a 9/8 and 10/9 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil al-Awsat&quot; (the<br/>&gt;&gt; middle conjoined); a 10/9 and 11/10 to arrive at &quot;Muttasil<br/>&gt;&gt; al-Thalith&quot; (the third conjoined).  The same operation where one<br/>&gt;&gt; diminishing superparticular ratio is skipped yields &quot;qawi munfasil&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; (Firm, sundered) for 8/7 and 10/9; &quot;mutadil munfasil&quot; (Moderate,<br/>&gt;&gt; sundered) for 9/8 and 11/10; and &quot;Shedd munfasil&quot; (Tightened,<br/>&gt;&gt; sundered) for 10/9 and 12/11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I notice that all the ratios in question are 8/7 or smaller,<br/>&gt; which would fit with my usual concept of a &quot;diatonic&quot; genus.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One can see similar explanations in Rauf Yekta, shedding (excuse<br/>&gt;&gt; the pun) much light into the confusion of the tetrachordal genera<br/>&gt;&gt; of the Ancient world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I have not quoted every line of your post, I would emphasize<br/>&gt; that every line is well worth study!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The tetrachord in question in your response is &quot;mutadil munfasil&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt; which is better translated as &quot;Moderate, sundered&quot; - to avoid<br/>&gt;&gt; confusion with the wholetone disjunction between tetrachords making<br/>&gt;&gt; an octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I agree that this is a fitting English translation!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [On coming article outlining some basic maqamat and O3 tunings]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One could perhaps organize this article in a database application<br/>&gt;&gt; such as Excel or Numbers. That would tidy things up a bit with<br/>&gt;&gt; interactive links for what goes where and which came whence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This sounds like a fine idea, although I am quite ignorant of such<br/>&gt; programs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s a notion. In the case of a Spreadsheet, one could variate<br/>&gt;&gt; the tunings by a drop-down menu to observe the effect<br/>&gt;&gt; instantaneously. Of course, some good folk from the list - who know<br/>&gt;&gt; Excel or Numbers much better than I - might be willing to assist?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such assistance could be very helpful. I do know that spreadsheets are<br/>&gt; often used in presenting tuning systems, and that you refer to such<br/>&gt; files in your thesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;              Penchgah                   Rast<br/>&gt;&gt;    |---------------------------|-------------------|<br/>&gt;&gt;  rast   dugah  segah   hijaz  neva huseyni  evdj gerdaniye<br/>&gt;&gt;    B      C#     Eb      F     F#     G#     Bb    B<br/>&gt;&gt;    0    207.4  369.1   576.6 703.1  911.7 1073.4 1200.0<br/>&gt;&gt; ~ 1/1   44/39  26/21   88/63   3/2  22/13  13/7   2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes, this is a very good Penchgah scale. What it needs is the<br/>&gt;&gt; occasional 4/3, or perde chargah for alterations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Intuitively I suspected that a 4/3 at perde chargah might occur, in<br/>&gt; part on the basis of looking at a few pieces in Penchgah available on<br/>&gt; the web. However, I must admit that when I start polyphonizing in<br/>&gt; Penchgah, the results are influenced mainly by 14th-century European<br/>&gt; patterns, which this maqam seems to fit so nicely in a Zalzalian<br/>&gt; variation, as it were! Understanding the typical Ottoman seyir might<br/>&gt; give me a fuller perspective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; With Shur, it is interesting that Turkish performers sometimes<br/>&gt;&gt; play a very low or septimal Ushshaq, if we may take as an example<br/>&gt;&gt; the performance of &quot;a venerable Turkish Neyzen&quot; or _Niyazi<br/>&gt;&gt; Sayin_. as you explain in your thesis at pp. 27-29. Here I quote<br/>&gt;&gt; your measured steps for this __Niyazi Sayin Ushshak Ney_ Taksim<br/>&gt;&gt; and JI values, plus an approximation in O3 (full 24 notes):<br/>&gt;&gt; Niyazi Sayin Ushshak Ney Taksim:  123.47    137.13     227.87<br/>&gt;&gt; JI:                               128.30    138.57     231.17<br/>&gt;&gt;                                    14:13     13:12       8:7<br/>&gt;&gt; O3:                               126.56    138.28     230.86<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Good comparisons. The whole point being not only to approximate the<br/>&gt;&gt; middle seconds anymore of course ... But to supply the listener<br/>&gt;&gt; with the benefits of enriched harmony through a clever tuning &amp;<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I much agree. What George Secor and I found is that harmonic or<br/>&gt; polyphonic progressions involving middle second steps can have a<br/>&gt; special beauty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [On Buzurg]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting point is the steps of 14:13-8:7-7:6-117:112<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (128.3-231.2-266.9-75.6 cents). The adjacent 8:7 and 7:6 steps in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the middle lead me to ask if these steps occur together, thus in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; effect dividing 4:3 into a trichord of 8:7:6, in other maqamat.  I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; need to try playing this and seeing where it takes me, but your<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; erudite intuition is indeed to be carefully considered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  Yes, there is 4:3 between the adjacent 8:7 and 7:6. There is no<br/>&gt;&gt;  interruption in ascent or descent of the given scale.  But this is<br/>&gt;&gt;  a very peculiar and little-trodden domain! One can seldom see this<br/>&gt;&gt;  kind of thing in a double-Segah instance seperated by a fifth: a<br/>&gt;&gt;  &quot;segah-chargah-segah-kurdi-rast-kurdi-segah&quot; pattern repeated 3:2<br/>&gt;&gt;  above with the addition of perde chargah and neva in ascent up to<br/>&gt;&gt;  there. I noticed the full pentachord more pronounced in the seyir<br/>&gt;&gt;  of Ferahnak than anywhere else; hence the name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly this interpretation of Buzurg as 1/1-14/13-16/13-56/39-3/2<br/>&gt; seems &quot;very peculiar and little trodden&quot; to me also! But as to the<br/>&gt; double Segah instance, I am trying to understand this as possibly<br/>&gt; something like the following, where I have indicated the pitches in<br/>&gt; cents with respect both to rast, the first cardinal point as it were<br/>&gt; on the compass of the maqamat, and also segah:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         segah  chargah  segah kurdi rast kurdi segah chargah neva<br/>&gt; rast:    370    497     370   289    0   289    370   497    704<br/>&gt;          Bb      B       Bb    A     F#   A     Bb     B      C#<br/>&gt; segah:   0      127      0    1119  830  1119   0     127    334<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         evjd  gerdaniye evjd  ajem  neva ajem  evdj<br/>&gt; rast:   1073   1200     1073  993   704  993   1073<br/>&gt;           F      F#      F     E     C#   E     F<br/>&gt; segah:   703    830     703   622   334  622   703<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In Maqam Segah, I would take rast-kurdi-segah as what the Arabs call a<br/>&gt; _dint_ or semitone, here kurdi-segah, leading up to an important step<br/>&gt; of a maqam such here the final or tonic; and I have read of this in<br/>&gt; Signell&apos;s _Makam_. Thus perde dugah, the usual step below segah, is<br/>&gt; altered to kurdi, and from there a semitone up to segah.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I see how, from this &quot;double Segah,&quot; we can get a pentachord<br/>&gt; 0-127-334-622-703, rather like your 0-128-359-622-702 as one<br/>&gt; interpretation of Buzurg.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But reading again your comments, I must ask: is this &quot;double segah&quot; a<br/>&gt; form of Maqam Segah, or Maqam Ferahnak?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   In one thematic version and<br/>&gt;&gt;   14/13<br/>&gt;&gt;   16/13<br/>&gt;&gt;   4/3<br/>&gt;&gt;   56/39<br/>&gt;&gt;   diminished pentachord in another ascending/descending cadential<br/>&gt;&gt;   version. I don&apos;t remember if I had mentioned this, but there it<br/>&gt;&gt;   is.  The latter is akin to what I dub the &quot;Ferahnak<br/>&gt;&gt;   pentachord&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Errata: I meant &quot;the former is akin to the Ferahnak<br/>&gt;&gt; Pentachord&quot;. Not the diminished one, which is already defined in<br/>&gt;&gt; theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This correction I will note!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now comes our discussion of Ferahnak, which raises a problem which I<br/>&gt; can solve in O3, but imperfectly! To solve it more convincingly, I<br/>&gt; would need chains of fifths at least 12 fifths long, as would happen<br/>&gt; in a system based on two 17-MOS chains. Let us see my dilemma,<br/>&gt; starting with my quotation of Ferahnak according to Suphi Ezgi, and<br/>&gt; taking his two versions to be the ascending and descending forms:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  Ferahnak                 Hijaz<br/>&gt;        |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>&gt;        Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B      D    Eb<br/>&gt;        0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1119.1 1200.0<br/>&gt;          S       T      T      K     S     A      B<br/>&gt;        126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 288.3   81.9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  Ferahnak                Segah<br/>&gt;        |--------------------------|-----------------|<br/>&gt;        Eb    E      F#     G#     Bb    B    C#     Eb<br/>&gt;        0   126.6   334.0  542.6 704.3 830.8 1038.3 1200.0<br/>&gt;          S       T      T      K     S     T      K<br/>&gt;        126.6   207.4  208.6  161.7 126.6 207.4  161.7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Very good so far. But always have in spare the diminished Ferahnak<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachord on the finalis. Without that (and possibly my Ferahnak<br/>&gt;&gt; pentachord as well) the seyir will be incomplete. Also, preserve<br/>&gt;&gt; the Eb-Ab perfect fourth, which is a must for the correct tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This advice points to a glaring flaw in the O3 system, if we wish to<br/>&gt; have available both Ezgi&apos;s pentachord of S-T-T-K at Eb-E-F#-G#-Bb. and<br/>&gt; a 4/3 step: the absence of a true Ab for a 4/3 step above Eb on either<br/>&gt; 12-note keyboard, which has a chain of only 11 fifths, Eb-G#!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I should note a question that comes up later in this reply: is a<br/>&gt; step at 543 cents permissible at any point in the seyir of Maqam<br/>&gt; Ferahnak, or must the fourth step always remain within about a comma<br/>&gt; of 4/3, as it woold with Ezgi&apos;s S-T-T-K at 5-9-9=8 commas in AEU, but<br/>&gt; not in O3? If in fact the O3 version of S-T-T-K does not fit Ferahnak,<br/>&gt; then the following tuning set would nicely provide all of the other<br/>&gt; ajnas you describe, including the &quot;double segah,&quot; if I am correct.<br/>&gt; The diagram shows rast-evdj on the first line, with evdj-tiz segah on<br/>&gt; the second line:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; rast:   0     209   289   370   496     704   866   993   1073<br/>&gt; segah: -370  -162   -81    0    127     334   496   622   704<br/>&gt;         F#*   G#*   A*    Bb*    B*     C#*    Eb*   E*    F*<br/>&gt;        rast dugah  kurdi segah chargah neva   hisar ajem  evdj<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; rast:  1073    1200    1409      1489     1570<br/>&gt; segah:  704     830    1038      1119     1200<br/>&gt;          F*     F#*     G#*       A*       Bb*<br/>&gt;        evdj  gerdaniye muhayyer sunbule  tiz segah<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To get Ezgi&apos;s version of a Ferahnak pentachord, S-T-T-K, we must start<br/>&gt; at Eb on either keyboard, permitting Eb-E-F#-G#-Bb, with Eb-G# at<br/>&gt; around 543 cents from 11 fifths up. To get the closest equivalent to a<br/>&gt; step at 4/3, we must place the final of Ferahnak at Eb* on the upper<br/>&gt; keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; rast:   0    207   288   369   496     703  854    912   993   1073<br/>&gt; segah: -369 -162   -81    0    127     334  485    543   623    704<br/>&gt;         B*   C#*    D*   Eb*    E*     F#*   G#    G#*    A*    Bb*<br/>&gt;        rast dugah kurdi segah chargah neva  nerm  huseyni ajem  evdj<br/>&gt;                                             hisar<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; rast:  1073    1200    1407      369       496<br/>&gt; segah:  704     831    1038      1119      127<br/>&gt;         Bb*     B*      C#*       D*       Eb*<br/>&gt;        evdj  gerdaniye muhayyer sunbule  tiz segah<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here Ezgi&apos;s version of Ferahnak is available without problem, as is<br/>&gt; the &quot;double segah&quot; you described above, and your Ferahnak pentachord<br/>&gt; resembling your first interpretation of Buzurg with an ajem-evdj step:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     0       127    334     623  704<br/>&gt;     Eb*      E*    F#*     A*   Bb*<br/>&gt;    segah  chargah  neva   ajem  evdj<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The diminished Ferahnak pentachord, however, must use Eb*-G# at about<br/>&gt; 485 cents, or 13 cents narrow of 4/3, as the closest equivalent for a<br/>&gt; perfect fourth:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     0       127    334    485     623<br/>&gt;     Eb*      E*    F#*    G#       A*<br/>&gt;    segah  chargah  neva  nerm     ajem<br/>&gt;                          hisar<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This tuning might in fact be closer to a Syrian version of Maqam Iraq,<br/>&gt; which may favor a fourth step around 21 commas or 21/16, with a school<br/>&gt; of Aleppo specifying 6-9|6-7-9|9-7 commas, than a diminished Ferahnak<br/>&gt; pentachord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, from a further comment you make, this compromise may be not<br/>&gt; only unnecessary but beside the point, since the purpose is also to<br/>&gt; have available a step at 543 cents (Eb*-G#* or segah-huseyni), which<br/>&gt; in fact may be impermissible for Maqam Ferahnak.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 543 cents cannot be allowed for maqam Ferahnak, the perfect fourth<br/>&gt;&gt; must be present at all times.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The statement &quot;at all times&quot; -- rather that in certain portions of the<br/>&gt; seyir such as the diminished Ferahnak pentachord -- suggests to me<br/>&gt; that Ezgi&apos;s S-T-T-K might be admissible in AEU, but not in O3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In AEU, Ezgi&apos;s lower Ferahnak tetrachord S-T-T-K would be, as Signell<br/>&gt; notes, 5-9-9-8 commas or 0-114-318-522-702 cents, with 23 commas or<br/>&gt; 522 cents curiously fitting the observed peak at 523 cents in Maqam<br/>&gt; Segah reported in theoryVSpractice (pp. 64 and 66).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In O3, S-T-T-K or Eb-E-F#-G#-Bb is 0-127-334-543-704 cents, with Eb-G#<br/>&gt; at 543 cents resulting, like the 23-comma step in AEU, from 11 fifths<br/>&gt; up. If 543 cents &quot;cannot be allowed&quot; at any point in the seyir,<br/>&gt; although the 522 cents of AEU is sometimes permissible, could this be<br/>&gt; because the fourth step may be up to about a comma wide, but not wider<br/>&gt; to the point where it it is no longer recognizable as any kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;perfect fourth,&quot; but becomes a Zalzalian interval more like 11/8?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If so, a lesson would be that a given jins often, but not always, will<br/>&gt; translate successfully from AEU to the &quot;moderate, sundered&quot; style of<br/>&gt; intonation in O3, based on rast-segah at around 26/21, with S-T-T-K of<br/>&gt; Maqam Ferahnak as an example correct in AEU but not O3. One should<br/>&gt; instead use S-T-K (usual Segah genus at 127-207-162 cents), S-T-K-S<br/>&gt; (diminished Ferahnak pentachord at 127-207-162-127 cents), or your<br/>&gt; striking Ferahnak pentachord of S-T-A-B (127-207-288-81 cents).  All<br/>&gt; of these ajnas except S-T-T-K are available with the final of Ferahnak<br/>&gt; at Bb or Bb*, where a regular 4/3 at 496 cents is available without<br/>&gt; any problem! And at Bb or Bb* we also have the &quot;double Segah&quot; pattern<br/>&gt; your have pointed out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, Hijaz-e Muhalif reminds me of the Persian Mokhalef,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; another topic (and rather like one flavor of Esfahan)! I&apos;d love to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; learn more about Hijaz-i Muhalif.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  I recall it was mentioned by Nasir Dede, but I have to check that<br/>&gt;&gt;  later when an oppurtune moment arrives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This I would be very curious to learn about when you do check it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed O3 is designed to place perde segah at around 370 cents in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; order to optimize the kind of historical Ottoman flavor we are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; discussing. And it&apos;s fascinating how Safi al-Din al-Urmavi&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Medium disjunct&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Moderate, sundered. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I definitely agree, and will prefer this English translation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Best, with warmest thanks to Dr. Arslan also,<br/>&gt;&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;m forwarding this to him as BCC. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be delighted to<br/>&gt;&gt; know an erudite Renaissance music theorist is so deeply interested<br/>&gt;&gt; in the theory of makamlar!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One fine point about the term &quot;Renaissance,&quot; which I find correct,<br/>&gt; although some conventional historians of European music might be<br/>&gt; surprised.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, the Mutazilah Era in the Islamic world coincides with a<br/>&gt; series of &quot;Renaissance&quot; movements in Europe, starting around 800-900<br/>&gt; with the Carolingian Renaissance, and reaching a height with what is<br/>&gt; often called the &quot;12th-century Renaissance&quot; continuing through the<br/>&gt; 13th century, or the age of Safi al-Din and Qutb al-DIn. The 12th-14th<br/>&gt; centuries especially influence my approach to Zalzalian polyphony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In conventional European history, the term &quot;Renaissance&quot; often means<br/>&gt; the 15th and 16th centuries, marked in musical terms, for example, by<br/>&gt; the rise of meantone temperament. Indeed this period also fascinates<br/>&gt; me, but I would say that my approach to maqam/dastgah polyphony draws<br/>&gt; much more on the earlier Mutazilah Era, which of course had a vast<br/>&gt; influence on European philosophy, music, and other aspects of culture!<br/>&gt; While European history often simply terms this era &quot;medieval,&quot; it<br/>&gt; could equally well be described as &quot;Renaissance.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Cordially,<br/>&gt;&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With many thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
