I have both MidiConv and<br/>Scala, but acnnot figure out how to make either one of them retune a<br/>MIDI file into Werckmeister III.  I&apos;m doing a presentation using Bach&apos;s<br/>WTC, talking about the temperaments used at the time.  I want to retune<br/>a MIDI file in Werckmeister III to show that &quot;well&quot; temperaments that<br/>&quot;do not injure the variegation of the keys&quot; (Kirnberger) make each key<br/>sound different.  To do this I am taking a MIDI file of the Prelude #1<br/>in C and transposing it to B, C, and D, then retuning each in<br/>Werckmeister III to show how Bach wrote the WTC to _capitalize_ on the<br/>eccentricities of well temperament; the ear will automatically _know_<br/>which is right because Bach wrote it specifically for well-temperament.<br/>I don&apos;t know how much sense this is making, but I just would like to<br/>know how to use either of the aforementioned programs to retune a MIDI<br/>file.</p><p>I also would like to know how to retune a whole keyboard (if possible)<br/>and to play MIDI files through it in the altered temperament.  However,<br/>since I&apos;ll have to give this presentation with a computer and keyboard<br/>which are not my own, it would be of greatest benefit to me if I could<br/>simply retune the file itself.  If you have an answer of how to do this,<br/>please email me privately at <a href="mailto:tenorhead@yahoo.com">tenorhead@yahoo.com</a>.  Thanks a lot!</p><p>-Brad Beyenhof</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
