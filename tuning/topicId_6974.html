I&apos;ve met Joe at a Boston Microtonal Society meeting<br/>and I&apos;ve seen Mat a couple of times playing with the incredible Indian-jazz<br/>fusion band, NATRAJ.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Steve also<br/>plays Rhodes with a bitchin&apos; funk/fusion band every Thursday night at the<br/>Middle East in Cambridge . . .</p></div>
