And I definitely remember wondering (very early on) what<br/>would &apos;happen&apos; if the twelve frets that I was used to (where the octave of<br/>1200c was evenly/equally divided), were instead, evenly/equally _spaced_...<br/>So one of the very first things I (inadvertently) ended up trying on a<br/>fretless guitar, was a quick and dirty &apos;undertone,&apos; or &apos;aliquot&apos; - 1/1,<br/>24/23, 12/11, 8/7, 6/5, 24/19, 4/3, 24/17, 3/2, 8/5, 12/7, 24/13, 2/1 -<br/>&apos;inversion&apos; of the 12-24 you gave.</p><p>Dan</p></div>
