Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2001 10:22:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and in response to a question from Maurizio Umberto<br/>Puxeddu, I would like to say, speaking only for myself although citing<br/>also the musical efforts of various other contributors to this Tuning<br/>List, that I regard just intonation or &quot;JI&quot; as a very diverse category<br/>of tunings, and that I am also very involved with a range of<br/>temperaments, including now and then 24-tone equal temperament<br/>(24-tET).</p><p>Please know that you are not alone, as I&apos;m sure that other contributors<br/>here such as Dan Stearns with his many scales and temperaments, and Jacky<br/>Ligon with his complex and subtle ratios, can reassure you. As John<br/>deLaubenfels has remarked, there is a wide range of musical tastes on this<br/>list, and his own innovative contributions in the area of variable<br/>adaptive tuning have sparked admiration from people who may themselves be<br/>involved with quite different styles of music or tuning systems.</p><p>First of all, I regard &quot;JI&quot; as an approach to tuning based on integer<br/>ratios, rather than a specific tuning or musical style: a &quot;JI&quot; major<br/>third might be 81:64 (medieval Pythagorean), 5:4 (Renaissance), 9:7 or<br/>14:11 or 21:17 or sometimes 13:10 (neo-Gothic), and so on.</p><p>Various temperaments from Renaissance meantone to a 21st-century<br/>neo-serialist 11-tET or 13-tET to Gary Morrison&apos;s 88-CET (88-cent<br/>equal temperament) present variations on this spectrum -- not to omit<br/>Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic scale and tetradic harmony in 22-tET.</p><p>Here I&apos;ve been mostly addressing European and derived music, but of course<br/>the tuning systems of many world cultures offer a much greater range of<br/>diversity, from the pelog and slendro of gamelan to the complex sonorities<br/>of Japanese gagaku and the 17-note Pythagorean systems of Arabic or<br/>Persian traditions at once curiously familiar to me from a<br/>Gothic/neo-Gothic perspective, and yet quite different with their own<br/>independent musical languages.</p><p>One very important point I might make about my own preferences, and<br/>suspect that others might make about theirs, is that such preferences<br/>are often intimately related to specific musical styles.</p><p>For example, John deLaubenfels and I might have very different views<br/>about the best integer ratios for major thirds -- because these<br/>intervals may have radically different roles in our respective<br/>preferred styles.</p><p>Perotin or Landini does not sound like Vicentino, who in turn does not<br/>sound like Bach or modern jazz or barbershop -- and if the music is<br/>different, the most &quot;just&quot; or fitting tunings are likely to differ<br/>also. The same statement applies for the temperaments which may be most<br/>pleasingly tempered to a given style.</p><p>Personally I find 24-tET a fascinating system because it combines<br/>near-just fifths and slightly subdued major thirds (400 cents, or<br/>about 8 cents narrower than the usual Pythagorean 81:64) with very<br/>close approximations of 13:10 (450 cents or 9/24 octave) and 15:13<br/>(250 cents or 5/24 octave), and also 26:15 (950 cents or 19/24<br/>octave). The 950-cent interval, for example, can serve as either a<br/>wide major sixth or a narrow minor seventh.</p><p>Also, from a &quot;JI-oriented&quot; point of view, 24-tET has fine<br/>approximations of 11:9 (350 cents, 7/24 octave) and 11:8 (550 cents,<br/>11/24 octave).</p><p>As it happens, I tend mostly to lean either toward Pythagorean and<br/>neo-Gothic tunings with fifths pure or wider than pure, or else<br/>Renaissance meantones for late 15th to early 17th-century music.<br/>However, 24-tET is for me a very welcome diversion, a curiously<br/>&quot;20th-century&quot; way of looking at things with an elegant symmetry and<br/>some very creative ambiguities.</p><p>Chromaticism is a fascinating theme in many tunings, and as one<br/>especially interested in chromaticism in either a Renaissance meantone<br/>setting (e.g. Vicentino) or in various neo-Gothic temperaments with<br/>steps not too far from the 50 cents of 24-tET, I would guess that you<br/>may be enjoying many creative opportunities.</p><p>Please let me welcome to you to this Tuning List, and emphasize that<br/>pluralism both in JI systems and in temperaments is a very important<br/>value here.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=17375 href="#17375">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2001 6:21:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
