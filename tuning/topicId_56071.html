Jon Szanto was also<br/>on the panel.  and it was great to see _The Dreamer That<br/>Remains_ yet again ... that movie makes a stronger impression<br/>on me every time i see -- truly a marvelous tribute to Partch.</p><p>the photo of Partch playing the Cloud Chamber Bowls which<br/>prefaced every copy of the printed program was done in a<br/>sea-green tint that was very nice.  a real momento to add<br/>to my Partch collection.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
