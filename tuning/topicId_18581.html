Could I suddenly accept 13/6 or 17/6 as<br/>more consonant that 10/7, or 11/7 as more consonant than 11/8?  Were the dyads<br/>in each row really of equal consonance?  Listening to the intervals was a<br/>convincing exercise, and then looking at the spectra redoubled my conviction.</p><p>However, this experiment also made it more clear to me that  _contextual_<br/>consonance will often be independent from the sensory. For example, the<br/>interjection of an augmented fourth or diminished fifth of whatever ratio into a<br/>collection of otherwise perfect fourths or fifths might create a more jarring<br/>effect then the presence of a neutral third. Or, in a texture of only ratios<br/>composed of factors of 3 and 7, the introduction of 5:4 Major third might be<br/>jarring. In this way, the issue of limits and factoring (prime, odd etc.) was<br/>identified as a compositional or stylistic concern rather than an immediately<br/>perceptual one.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Budapest<br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div>
