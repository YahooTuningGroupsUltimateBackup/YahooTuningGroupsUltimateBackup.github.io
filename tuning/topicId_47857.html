(See my previous papers in the Bulletin: &quot;Bode&apos;s Law<br/>Explained,&quot; Cycles 30: 82, 1979, and &quot;On the Special Theory of<br/>Order,&quot; Cycles 36: 219, 1985.) Therefore, if the clock pattern is<br/>applied to our solar-planetary system--both systems involve objects<br/>in 360-degree motion around their respective centers--any two planets<br/>will cross only a certain number of times. Thereafter, the pattern<br/>repeats. (see my paper: &quot;Why the sunspot cycle 22 years long?&quot;<br/>Cycles 46: 3, 1996.)</p><p>As I pointed out in my previously cited papers, the primary cause of<br/>the full-wave 22-year sunspot cycle is the Saturn-Uranus synodic<br/>cycle. These two planets cross &quot;only 22 times&quot; before the pattern<br/>repeats.</p><p>Whereas a clock has only two hands, the solar-planetary system is not<br/>made up of a mere two planets; the cumulative effect of each set of<br/>two planets must be computed as they relate to the others. In<br/>addition, the solar-planetary electrical and magnetic field in which<br/>the multitude of planets move and cross, is, itself, in motion with<br/>respect to the center of the galaxy. Also, the planets are<br/>precessing with respect to the distant star field. Consequently, our<br/>solar-planetary system will not behave as methematically precise as a<br/>clock. Indeed, each individual 22-year cycle varies immensely, from<br/>about 20.8 to about 27 years.</p><p>In The Old Farmer&apos;s Almanac 1981, Guy Murchie popularized my theory<br/>by reference to my publications, asking: &quot;Is there order among the<br/>planets? Or, as Pythagoras once put it, is there Music in the<br/>Spheres?&quot;</p><p>I published Arnold&apos;s Law in 1979, as follows:</p><p>Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal Mean**<br/>Or Perimeter</p><p>Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles<br/>Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28<br/>Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42<br/>Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56<br/>Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12<br/>Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24<br/>Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49<br/>Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74<br/>Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99</p><p>*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;</p><p>**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet</p><p>In conclusion, I urge interested readers to review the detailed<br/>heliocentric data and patterns pub lished in my earlier papers.<br/>Perhaps someone can generate a full-scale computer analysis to<br/>confirm why the sunspot cycle averages 22 years.</p><p>================================================================<br/>Message 66 to <a href="mailto:Celestial-tuning@yahoogroups.com">Celestial-tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>From:  Bill Arnold &lt;billarnoldfla@y...&gt;<br/>Date:  Tue Oct 1, 2002  11:52 pm<br/>Subject:  Re: ON THE SPECIAL THEORY OF ORDER</p><p>Norman Winski writes, &quot;Martin, Have you read John Nelson&apos;s or Jane<br/>Blizard&apos;s work on the correlation of planetary positions with Solar<br/>activity?

Your<br/>solar sunspot cycle work seems interesting and I would like to learn<br/>more about your interpretations and hypothesis.&quot;</p><p>My paper &quot;On the Special Theory of Order&quot; cover pages 219 to 232,<br/>Cycles Bulletin, Vol. XXXVI, No. 9, December 1985, with<br/>illustrations, charts, and drawings, and here is the Table of<br/>Contents and Abstract:</p><p>Table of Contents</p><p>I Abstract<br/>II Introduction, Electro-Magnetic Nature of the Solar Wind<br/>III Analysis of the Primary 22-Year Sunspot Cycle, See figure 1<br/>IV Analysis of the Nile Flood Cycle, see Figure 1<br/>V Analysis of the Secondary 100-Year Sunspot Cycle and the 100-Year</p><p>Weather Cycle, see Figure 1 and Schedule 1<br/>VI Analysis of the Primary 22-Year Sunspot Cycle Nodes, see Schedule<br/>1<br/>VII Theory of a Special Order, see Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5<br/>VII EMF (electro-magnetic force) Mechanism of a Galactic-Solar-<br/>Planetary System Postulated, see Figure 6<br/>IX Philosophical Considerations on an Ordered Galactic-Solar-<br/>Planetary System<br/>X Bibliography</p><p>I. ABSTRACT</p><p>On the Special Theory of Order postulates Order. It holds that the<br/>physical laws of reality, known as &quot;physics&quot; in the realm of Science,<br/>extend into deep space. Certainly, they extend from the center of<br/>our own Milky Way galaxy to the center of our own Solar-Planetary<br/>System, the Sun. A Special Order on a cosmic scale, as demonstrated<br/>by this paper, is observed in the positive Correlation between the<br/>Sunspot, the Weather and the Planetary Cycles. In a previous paper<br/>on Solar-Planetary System Order (in CYCLES, &quot;Bode&apos;s Law Explained,&quot;<br/>1979) this author demonstrated ordinal Proportionality between<br/>planetary average distances from the Sun. In this present treatise,<br/>when planetary synodic cycles are oriented to the Galactic-Solar Axis<br/>(266-degrees to 86-degrees), a positive correlation is shown to exist<br/>between these mechanical events and subsequent electro-magnetic data<br/>observed in the Sunspot cycle and earthly Weather cycles. An emf<br/>(electro-magnetic force) mechanism is postulated, and supported by<br/>the work of Hale, Nicholson, Ellerman, Joy, Slurzberg and Osterheld,<br/>Sheeley, Parker, Van Allen, Chambers, Nelson, Jones, Bray and<br/>Loughead, and will account for the modulated cycle effects, supported<br/>by the work of Dewey, Shirk, Jarvis, Ludwig, Eddy and Hand. The<br/>Special Theory of Order about the mechanism of our Galactic-Solar<br/>Planetary System with the planets acting as conductor-inductors<br/>within the solar wind field when oriented to the Galactic center now<br/>appears more evident, suggesing a Special Order from the Macrocosm<br/>down to the micro.</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>The New Yahoo!
