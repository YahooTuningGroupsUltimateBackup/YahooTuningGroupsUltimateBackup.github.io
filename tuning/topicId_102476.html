See<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/subgroup/">http://lumma.org/music/theory/subgroup/</a><br/>&gt; where I ran afoul of this (you&apos;ll have to actually read<br/>&gt; it this time to get to that part).</p><p>I&apos;ve read it, but many things didn&apos;t make much sense to me before and still don&apos;t now.  Are you saying that 5 cents of adjusted error on the 2.7.11.13.15 subgroup is somehow more error than 5 cents of adjusted error on the 2.3.5.7.11 subgroup?  From what Paul told me about optimization, I got the impression that higher-complexity doesn&apos;t mean odd limit but rather lattice complexity, meaning that on the 5-limit, 2, 3, and 5 are all weighted equally, but intervals like 27/25 or 125/81 are forgiven more.  There was a big discussion between Paul and Michael S. over some temperament where 10/7 was equated with 13/9 but came out as almost exactly 10/7, and Michael thought that meant that this is because ratios of 13 are weighted less in the optimization than ratios of 7.  Paul said no, it&apos;s because of the push-and-pull effect of other commas in the temperament they were looking at, and demonstrated another temperament where the same two ratios were equated and the resultant interval was right between them in size.</p><p>Also, I take issue with a couple aspects of your approach: 1) you allow for the inclusion of the 17th harmonic in all sizes of subgroup.  I tried to be more conservative, putting the cutoff at 15 and looking only at pentads, because we can be reasonably certain that *all* pentads of the 15-odd-limit will be concordant in at least one voicing.  A lot of the best subroups you came up with for the various ETs strike me as not being very musically-relevant.  2) in some of the pages you looked at nonoctave ETs, rather than including non-integer basis intervals.

This is logflat badness --<br/>see my recent posts for why it&apos;s important.</p><p>&gt; I went with square root because I figured that the<br/>&gt; negative impact of further increasing complexity from<br/>&gt; a given n-ET decreases as the complexity of n increases.<br/>&gt; Or in other words, as n increases, the difference<br/>&gt; of rank-1 generator size between n and n+1 decreases.</p><p>Your search returns a result for every ET and only<br/>considers subgroups starting with 2 and uses notes/oct<br/>as a complexity.  All fine choices, but we need to be<br/>aware that it means that complexity plays no role in<br/>which subgroup is selected for each ET.<br/>However: badness figures, if you report them, can still<br/>be used to compare final ETs results to one another,<br/>and then the complexity term will be important again.</p><p>Your point about increasing complexity mattering less<br/>is perfectly valid.  Just be aware that it penalizes<br/>simple systems more than you would probably like.</p><p>&gt; &gt; One big problem with using weighted error for such a<br/>&gt; &gt; search is that it favors complex subgroups showing up.<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s because larger errors are forgiven more on the<br/>&gt; &gt; high primes.  See<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/subgroup/">http://lumma.org/music/theory/subgroup/</a><br/>&gt; &gt; where I ran afoul of this (you&apos;ll have to actually read<br/>&gt; &gt; it this time to get to that part).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read it, but many things didn&apos;t make much sense to<br/>&gt; me before and still don&apos;t now.</p><p>Sorry.  I&apos;d appreciate any suggestions for improvement<br/>(offlist perhaps).</p><p>&gt; Are you saying that 5 cents of adjusted error on the<br/>&gt; 2.7.11.13.15 subgroup is somehow more error than 5 cents<br/>&gt; of adjusted error on the 2.3.5.7.11 subgroup?</p><p>All else being equal there&apos;s an equal chance of equal<br/>error on any prime among the ETs.  But if you use Tenney<br/>weighting, it makes a given error on large primes seem<br/>smaller.  So the average ET will appear to do better at<br/>subgroups with larger primes in them.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what adjusted error is.</p><p>&gt; From what Paul told me about optimization, I got the<br/>&gt; impression that higher-complexity doesn&apos;t mean odd limit<br/>&gt; but rather lattice complexity, meaning that on the 5-limit,<br/>&gt; 2, 3, and 5 are all weighted equally, but intervals like<br/>&gt; 27/25 or 125/81 are forgiven more.</p><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t know what weighting you&apos;re actually using.<br/>If you&apos;re using TOP damage or TE error or any other<br/>function of Tenney-weighted prime errors, you&apos;ll have the<br/>problem I describe above, as they do NOT weight the<br/>primes equally.  You seem to be describing a case when<br/>Paul showed that TOP damage reflects the weighted error<br/>of all JI intervals.  That&apos;s true but not relevant here.<br/>OTOH I could be misunderstanding from your description<br/>what Paul was saying.</p><p>&gt; Also, I take issue with a couple aspects of your approach:<br/>&gt; 1) you allow for the inclusion of the 17th harmonic in all<br/>&gt; sizes of subgroup.  I tried to be more conservative, putting<br/>&gt; the cutoff at 15 and looking only at pentads, because we can<br/>&gt; be reasonably certain that *all* pentads of the 15-odd-limit<br/>&gt; will be concordant in at least one voicing.</p><p>I do check all 5-combinations, which means I include<br/>everything you do except for subgroups with fractions in<br/>them.  I agree that subgroups like 2.15.17 etc are a bit<br/>ridiculous -- hence my &quot;penalty&quot; suggestion.</p><p>&gt; 2) in some of the pages you looked at nonoctave ETs,<br/>&gt; rather than including non-integer basis intervals.<br/>&gt; I included subgroups like 2.5/3.7/3.11/3.13/3, to include<br/>&gt; chords like 3:5:7:11:13 but ensure that they only appeared<br/>&gt; in octave-repeating ETs.</p><p>All pages include non-octave subgroups.  The vals I give<br/>always correspond to the subgroup, but to keep a common<br/>basis for the complexity, I always report the nearest<br/>steps/oct (calling it the &quot;ET&quot;) even if 2 isn&apos;t in the<br/>subgroup, error calc, and tuning optimization.  You can<br/>always think of these systems as ED2s if you want.<br/>For example</p><p>&gt; &quot;ET&quot;  primes            val<br/>&gt; 41  (5 13 17)         &lt;96 153 169]<br/>&gt; 41  (5 11 13 17)      &lt;96 143 153 169]<br/>&gt; 41  (5 7 11 13 17)    &lt;96 116 143 153 169]<br/>&gt; This looks 3 * 88-CET.</p><p>All of these are 96 ED5.  All would have 41/oct if there<br/>were an octave.  Therefore they all have a step size near<br/>29 cents, and therefore every 3rd note is like a note<br/>of 88-CET.</p><p>I always use the error that results from the optimal<br/>octave stretch.  That&apos;s more theoretically interesting<br/>but I like your approach of forcing pure octaves since<br/>that&apos;s what most instruments can handle easier.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 4.

Why is that important?</p><p>It&apos;s just to note that you can find the best subgroup for<br/>a given ET by only looking at the error.  You only need to<br/>consider complexity if you want to compare the performance<br/>of the ETs afterward.</p><p>&gt; &gt; All else being equal there&apos;s an equal chance of equal<br/>&gt; &gt; error on any prime among the ETs.  But if you use Tenney<br/>&gt; &gt; weighting, it makes a given error on large primes seem<br/>&gt; &gt; smaller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How so?</p><p>For a subgroup s1.s2.s3... with the error (in cents) of<br/>s1 = e1, s2 = e2... the TE error is</p><p>RMS(e1/log(s1), e2/log(s2), ...)</p><p>We use base-2 logs, so log(2) = 1.  Which is to say the<br/>octave&apos;s error isn&apos;t weighted at all.  The error on 3 is<br/>weighted by something like 1.6.  That means the error is<br/>divided by 1.6 relative to the octave&apos;s error.  So if both<br/>2 and 3 were mistuned by the same amount it would appear<br/>that 2 was worse.  That&apos;s because the concordance of<br/>octaves is generally thought to deteriorate faster with<br/>mistuning than tritaves.  1.6 times faster in fact.  This<br/>works fine unless you&apos;re picking the subgroup based on<br/>the error.  Then complex ones will tend to look better.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So the average ET will appear to do better at<br/>&gt; &gt; subgroups with larger primes in them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t this just because larger primes are often more<br/>&gt; accurately represented in the average ET &lt; 100?</p><p>They&apos;re not!  Any prime other than 2 is likely to have<br/>the same unweighted error, on average.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You seem to be describing a case when<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul showed that TOP damage reflects the weighted error<br/>&gt; &gt; of all JI intervals.  That&apos;s true but not relevant here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not relevant?</p><p>Why aren&apos;t zebras on rollerskates relevant?  Kind of<br/>hard to answer.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I do check all 5-combinations, which means I include<br/>&gt; &gt; everything you do except for subgroups with fractions in<br/>&gt; &gt; them.  I agree that subgroups like 2.15.17 etc are a bit<br/>&gt; &gt; ridiculous -- hence my &quot;penalty&quot; suggestion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d rather just ignore them,</p><p>That&apos;s fine, as long as you have a definite rule about<br/>ignoring them, so people believe your search was fair.<br/>I tried to come up with a rule, for instance that the<br/>subgroup must have at least 3 consecutive primes or<br/>something like that, but that won&apos;t work on subgroups with<br/>fractions in them.  Since I couldn&apos;t think of a good rule<br/>I proposed a penalty factor.  If you can suggest an<br/>&quot;ignore this subgroup&quot; rule I&apos;m all ears.</p><p>&gt; Paul and Keenan were both adamant about including fractional<br/>&gt; basis elements.  ETs like 25 and 23 suddenly look a lot<br/>&gt; better when you do include them.</p><p>Absolutely right; the only reason I didn&apos;t include them<br/>before is because I was ignorant.  By the way, I&apos;ve been<br/>channeling Graham this whole time.  It&apos;s great!</p><p>&gt; I think the fractional basis element approach is better,<br/>&gt; because it ensures that there&apos;s always a reasonably-<br/>&gt; accurate tuning of 2/1.  Without that, your 8-ET (for<br/>&gt; instance) is just BP.</p><p>Well, including those subgroups does more than address<br/>this particular issue.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I always use the error that results from the optimal<br/>&gt; &gt; octave stretch.  That&apos;s more theoretically interesting<br/>&gt; &gt; but I like your approach of forcing pure octaves since<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s what most instruments can handle easier.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To my knowledge, I&apos;m not forcing pure octaves.</p><p>If you use TE error (or adjusted error) you are in fact<br/>getting the error of the ET when octaves are optimally<br/>stretched.  Is that what you want?  Because some systems<br/>have significantly higher error if you don&apos;t allow that<br/>(it&apos;s not possible with ordinary guitar tunings and<br/>straight frets, for instance).</p><p>&gt; &gt; OK!  If we do that I think you&apos;ll have a bona fide<br/>&gt; &gt; contribution to music theory on your hands.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great!</p><p>Yeah, this is it.  I can feel it!</p><p>Hang on, there&apos;s no way you could have entered every<br/>possible 15-limit subgroup into Graham&apos;s website for<br/>every ET, is there?

My master list of non-redundant 5D subgroups containing at minimum one 15-limit otonal pentad.</p><p>I would reckon that giving a decently accurate representation of any one of these subgroups would be a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for versatile and reasonably-concordant harmony using at least one higher prime (11 or 13).</p><p>Going by the (flawed) error calculations I used initially, it looks like only tunings not suitable for this goal (adjusted error &gt;15 cents) are 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 15.  I&apos;m sure if we looked at 3D or 4D pentadic subgroups as well (like the 5-limit, 7-limit, and <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> and <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a> subgroups), most of these would go back on the &quot;acceptable&quot; list.  I can virtually guarantee that at least 8, 12, and 15 would.</p><p>Now, if only we could agree on a good way to calculate error for pure octave tunings, I could re-do the calculations and give an accurate reflection of what ED2s are actually good for.  Then we could extend that to badness rankings if we wanted to.</p><p>However, my real goal here was to make the point that concordant harmony is not rare among ETs (contrary to Paul&apos;s assertions that concordance is rare and therefore valuable), even if we demand chords as large as pentads with no identity beyond the 15th harmonic represented.  I&apos;m curious how a better error metric will change the spread, but I have doubts that it will make a significant difference in the overall picture.</p><p>-Igs</p></div>
