It also has some possibilities in musical instrument design (I think).  I&apos;ve started a drum with an egg shaped head, but I&apos;m wondering if this might have other applications....lute bodies, maybe?</p><p>The Formula:<br/>x = (+/-)sqrt(abs((a*(b/a)**(y/(a+b))**2)-(a-y)**2))</p><p>Definition of Terms:</p><p>&quot;x&quot; is plotted for both + and - &quot;y&quot; and only plotted for the range y=0 to y=a+b.</p><p>0&lt;=a and a&lt;=b<br/>(try a=b, a=1,b=2  a=1,b=3)</p><p>The (a-y)**2 will begin to exceed the first term when b/a gets much larger than 3/1.  I&apos;m not sure what the exact limit is.  It&apos;s something I&apos;m still trying to understand.</p><p>The basic form of the formula is the pythagorean theorem.  Radials from the focus (a) are the &quot;(a*(b/a)**(y/(a+b)&quot; term.  If an egg with a=1, b=2 (a total height of 3) is plotted in increments of .25, the radials at each step are the 12th root of 2 to the n (where n0 =0, n1=.25, etc.)</p><p>Robin Perry</p><p>Matter is energy and energy, space.<br/>The Nothing is something &apos;neath a featureless face.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a>.</p><p>Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at <a href="http://profiles.msn.com">http://profiles.msn.com</a>.</p></div>
