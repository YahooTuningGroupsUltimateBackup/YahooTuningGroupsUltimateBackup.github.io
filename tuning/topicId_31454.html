Many, many servers have few newsgroups,<br/>*very* few messages posted in those groups, and *lousy* message<br/>retention (try a day or two!). Airnews is one of the best NNTP<br/>servers available (unpaid customer endorsement)! Don&apos;t count on your<br/>ISP&apos;s newserver to (necessarily) be more than a joke (or to make<br/>available to their users a possible new &quot;rec.&quot; or &quot;alt.&quot; newsgroup as<br/>is being discussed)!... Expect to pay (at least) $10/month plus the<br/>$30 or so for a high-quality news reader/responder application such<br/>as Forte Agent. They are at: <a href="http://www.airnews.net">http://www.airnews.net</a>  Also, check out<br/>Uncensored News at <a href="http://www.uncensored-news.com">http://www.uncensored-news.com</a> ($9.95/month).</p><p>Two weeks retention (on a NNTP server is about as good as it gets<br/>(from my experience)... Depending on Google&apos;s continued fulfillment<br/>of their &quot;promise&quot; (to archive) *may* be a better long term bet than<br/>Yahoo&apos;s future status (of which I have no direct info or knowledge as<br/>to its &quot;durability&quot;). Such concerns may be the most profound long-<br/>term.</p><p>While &quot;...these new ads are unacceptable&quot;, indeed, consider the<br/>possibility of the following two options:</p><p>(1) A (probably idiotic and irritating) ad appears at the top-right<br/>of the message display only (so far *not* covering the relevant text<br/>and...ugh...necessitating the &quot;closing&quot; of each the pop-up boxes); or</p><p>(2) The necessity for [some person(s)] to actually *moderate* the<br/>group on an ongoing basis, in order to ensure that the all-too-<br/>typical unmoderated of obnoxious, repulsive, avaricious, and<br/>extremely pervasive (meaning very high quantities of such messages<br/>constantly) SPAM which intermingles (and, in many groups, eclipses by<br/>far what may be the relevant posts - if you can find those possibly<br/>relevant posts in a sea of SPAM) with the message headers of<br/>(possible) relevance and interest. Such pervasive (and completely off-<br/>topic) &quot;garbage&quot; SPAM dominating a large majority of &quot;interesting<br/>sounding&quot; groups which I have explored has soured me on Usenet<br/>lately. Filters, etc. are great (if you want to spend lots of your<br/>time constructing as well as endlessly adding to pass/block<br/>parameters in such filters, with only partial success, anyway)...</p><p>The best work-around which I came up with is: almost all SPAM is a<br/>relatively SMALL message size. Forte Agent (v1.8) can easily be set<br/>up with a Filter to ignore messages of *less* than a user-settable<br/>size. In the case of a group where, say attachments (such as images,<br/>audio files, etc) accompany most messages of interest to readers of<br/>that newsgroup, such a Filter works wonders (as SPAM does not<br/>typically contain either large message sizes, or attachments, at<br/>all). Lots of groups use *lots* of &quot;bandwidth&quot; and &quot;server &quot;hard-<br/>disk&quot; space on Usenet. This, then, must be a viable option<br/>technically (since many, many Usenet groups allready have such &quot;data<br/>intensive&quot; attachment content, and the better servers still archive<br/>the attachments (for up to the roughly 2 week retention time of<br/>Airnews, and a few of the other high-quality servers (such as<br/>Uncensored-news).</p><p>It seems to me that nothing would preclude a newsgroup from having<br/>standard ASCII TXT files (or any other file format preferred) as<br/>attachments (where the &quot;poster&quot; would have full control over the text<br/>formatting of their messages/diagrams). The messages themselves are<br/>plain text as well. IF, by some means such as a standard large (in<br/>bytes) message preamble/postscript inserted into each message and/or<br/>attachment (such that the sum of the message size plus any<br/>attachment&apos;s size would exceed a few hundred lines), the Forte Agent<br/>(drop messages/attachments of size less than a few hundred lines in<br/>length)&quot;filtering&quot; technique describe above may well work nicely...</p><p>Comments from others who have tried to filter SPAM on Usenet<br/>individually (without the assistance of a full-time moderator who<br/>constantly has to view and edit large quantities of posts, when one<br/>considers the daily quantity of SPAM in addition to relevant posts)<br/>are invited! Perhaps there are tools/services of which I am not aware<br/>which may be able to assist, without group members (or a moderator)<br/>fighting SPAM wars constantly. If such *were* the case, I would have<br/>to say that I would choose to bear with the obnoxious new Yahoo ads<br/>(for free), rather than pay $10/month just to be endlessly frustrated<br/>with endless quantities of &quot;HOT/STEAMING/REVOLTING/MORONIC/AVARICE&quot;<br/>SPAM interspersed along with (a few, one hopes) relevant posts...</p><p>Regards,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=31523 href="#31523">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2001 8:42:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; An excellent NNTP news reader/responder software interface is Forte<br/>&gt; Agent (1.8 works *great* with Win 9x, 1.9 beta will address some<br/>Win<br/>&gt; 2000 and Win Me &quot;issues&quot;, version 2.0 is upcoming (see v1.9 press<br/>&gt; release) at: <a href="http://www.forteinc.com/press/agent19.htm">http://www.forteinc.com/press/agent19.htm</a>). the free<br/>&gt; version (no outbound email, or the useful filters, however) is at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.forteinc.com/getfa/getfa.htm">http://www.forteinc.com/getfa/getfa.htm</a>  Agent 1.8 (final) is a<br/>mere<br/>&gt; $29 at: <a href="http://www.forteinc.com/">http://www.forteinc.com/</a>.
