The<br/>father &quot;Deepak&quot; invited me later to a gathering of seven Hindustani<br/>families, who would meet to play music at his apartment about once a<br/>month. I went there and had one of the most wonderful and lasting<br/>experiences of my life. We all sat on the floor and they played music<br/>for literally hours on end. After we had our delicious meal and much<br/>more music was played, they asked me to play, so with a little<br/>encouragement, I brought in my guitar. I remember my absolute fear to<br/>play in front of these fine people who had just treated me to hours<br/>of some of the most intimate and lovely music I had ever heard, and I<br/>actually broke into a profuse sweat. They brought me a towel, and<br/>after I got my composure back, I asked what we might play together.<br/>Suresh the violin master and teacher, said &quot;why don&apos;t we play a<br/>blues&quot;? So I commenced to play a 12 bar blues pattern on my guitar.<br/>Momentarily, the tabla players joined in, then the violin, then flute<br/>and some improvised singing from the three female singers, and<br/>harmonium, as well as everyone was swaying and clapping to the<br/>rhythm. Pure ecstasy filled the room - perhaps like I have never felt<br/>before - it was just the wonderful intimacy of that moment that stays<br/>with me. When we finished about a 40 minute improvisation, everyone<br/>in the room just clapped and clapped. It was such a wonderful union<br/>between us all, and I will forever cherish this memory as one of the<br/>most wonderful and important formative experiences of my musical life.</p><p>How do I listen to music I am unfamiliar with, one may ask?  I listen<br/>from my heart, and my body - without preconceptions, and a quality of<br/>emptiness, which frees my mind to appreciate almost anything (this<br/>comes from my meditation training, where I contemplate nature and<br/>natural objects without preconceptions; shutting off the judging part<br/>of my ego consciousness, so that some portion of the object under<br/>contemplation may be apprehended and appreciated in a language beyond<br/>words - comprehension with the soul).  Even though I didn&apos;t then, or<br/>now fully understand what was happening within the cultural context<br/>of that blissful evening, and a great deal of it was incomprehensible<br/>to me; I *did* experience the profound beauty of this wonderful<br/>moment of sharing. As you have wisely suggested to me, it can be<br/>sufficient to appreciate the sounds, and it is not always necessary<br/>to grasp every cultural dimension in order to enjoy musics outside of<br/>ones culture. Music is a Universal Language which speaks to the<br/>ineffable and underlying essences of our existence. This leaps across<br/>cultural boundaries as if they were not there at all, when one&apos;s<br/>heart is ready for the transmission. One must understand how to love<br/>unconditionally to experience many rare forms of bliss. Even today, I<br/>still feel the way I did that night when they asked me to introduce<br/>myself, and I said &quot;My name is Jacky Ligon, and I love Indian people<br/>and Indian music&quot;, to which the room filled with profuse applause. I<br/>try to apply this evenness of heart to all things, even though I<br/>stand as an imperfect human being.</p><p>Eternal Blessings,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=20771 href="#20771">ðŸ”—</a>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2001 9:50:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 4/2/01 10:25 PM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hareshbakshi@hotmail.com">hareshbakshi@hotmail.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; This listening session has given rise to a series of nagging<br/>&gt; questions: How do we listen to music?

Of course, this is a<br/>hard thing to know the intent of an artist, and whether or not they are<br/>communicating what they are attempting.</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:ligonj@northstate.net">ligonj@northstate.net</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Listening to Music: What and How?</p><p>&gt; How do I listen to music I am unfamiliar with, one may ask?

I&apos;ll add to my above that I<br/>respond to the sacred in music (not necessarily religious) and to passion of<br/>the artistic expression. And I find these in many diverse forms and styles.<br/>I find myself drawn to music that is &quot;real&quot;, so much in our culture is mass<br/>marketed McMusic.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p><p>Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many<br/>generations; do not believe merely because the written statement of some old<br/>sage is produced; do not believe merely in the authority of your teachers<br/>and elders.
