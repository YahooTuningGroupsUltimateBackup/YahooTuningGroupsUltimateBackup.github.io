But isn&apos;t it striking that so many other genres of music DO<br/>&gt;&gt;encourage improvisation, rearrangement, etc.?  How, and importantly<br/>&gt;&gt;WHEN, did classical music become subject to this rigidified attitude?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Never!  The best composers and performers have always borrowed and<br/>&gt;experimented.  Bach made folk songs and sacred hymns into fugues, wrote<br/>&gt;dances in the style of Scarlatti... Ravel orchestrated Musorgsky... ELP<br/>&gt;re-orchestrated Musorgsky... The Byrds sang Dylan... Dylan sang folk<br/>&gt;music... Glenn Gould played everything as strangely as possible...  In Jazz<br/>&gt;they don&apos;t even bother to notate everything.</p><p>Carl, I think the person to whom you responded had in mind a lot of the<br/>opinions expressed on this list.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal quintet,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div>
