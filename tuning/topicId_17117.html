Introduction.<br/>The Indian tanpura, also called tambora/tambura/tamboura, is the<br/>Indian drone used as an accompaniment to a classical music<br/>performance.  It is a wooden instrument with a gourd resonator.  It<br/>has four strings, usually three steel and one copper.<br/>The first string is played with the middle (or the ring) finger. the<br/>remaining three strings, with the index finger.</p><p>II.  The Tuning.<br/>There are four kinds of raga-s, requiring the following variations in<br/>the tuning of the first string.  The tuning of the remaining three<br/>strings remains constant.</p><p>[1] Those raga-s which omit F:<br/>Examples: Bhupali, Shankara, Desakar<br/>Tanpura tuning: 1st string: G (lower octave)<br/>                2nd string: C<br/>                3rd string: C<br/>                4th string: C (lower octave)</p><p>[2] Those raga-s which include both F and G. Here we have two types:<br/>(a) Those dominated by G. The strings are tuned as in [1].<br/>Examples: Bhairava, Yaman.</p><p>(b) Those dominated by F. Here the first string is tuned in F (lower<br/>octave) . The remaining three strings remain the same.<br/>Examples: Bageshri, Lalit pancham.<br/>Tanpura tuning: 1st string: F (lower octave)<br/>                2nd string: C<br/>                3rd string: C<br/>                4th string: C (lower octave)</p><p>[3] Those which omit G. The strings are tuned as in [2b].<br/>Examples: Malkaus, Lalit.</p><p>[4] Many evening ragas like Marva, Puriya, Poorvi; also, Sohani. Here<br/>the first string is tuned in B (lower octave). The remaining three<br/>strings remain the same.  These raga-s contain F# as one of the<br/>notes, giving us a tritone.<br/>Tanpura tuning: 1st string: B (lower octave)<br/>                2nd string: C<br/>                3rd string: C<br/>                4th string: C )lower octave)</p><p>III.  &quot;JAWARI&quot; (or jiwari): The little-known Secret.<br/>Tied separately at the lower end of the tanpura, the four strings,<br/>separately pass over the specially treated bridge.  They eventually<br/>reach their respective pegs. Small threads (about 3&quot; to 4&quot; -- the<br/>length is irrelevant) of cotton or silk, of suitable thickness, are<br/>passed, separately, BETWEEN the four metal strings and the bridge.<br/>The location, on the bridge, of each of the cotton pieces, is<br/>adjusted, by trial and error, till each metal string gives out loud,<br/>clear, very distinct sound.  This happens only at a specific location<br/>on the bridge, of each thread, BUT AT NO OTHER LOCATION.  These<br/>threads are each called a &quot;jawari&quot;.  The process of bringing out the<br/>special sound is called &quot;to bring out jawari&quot;.<br/>For each string, the wave form of the jiwari sound is very different<br/>from that of the vibrating string, though the pitch is the same.  The<br/>number and relative strengths of the harmonics could be different.<br/>This deserves a very special study. If I recollect correctly, the<br/>only study on the jawari is a monogram written by no less a person<br/>than Sir C.V.Raman, the great Nobel laureate in Physics (do you<br/>recall &quot;the Raman effect&quot; in Physics?).  Could any study of shruti,<br/>intervals, and harmonics, perhaps, be incomplete, till we come to<br/>know jiwari better?  Any suggestions? [I have not read the monogram,<br/>only heard about it].  Does anyone know about any other study on<br/>jawari?<br/>Thanks.</p><p>Haresh BAKSHI<br/><a href="http://www.SoundOfIndia.com">www.SoundOfIndia.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=17127 href="#17127">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2001 6:27:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, hareshbakshi@h... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17117">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17117</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haresh BAKSHI<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.SoundOfIndia.com">www.SoundOfIndia.com</a></p><p>Thank you, Mr. Bakshi, for your explanation of some of the<br/>fundamentals of Indian music.
