However it seems to go too far! It makes them look as if they are only 5-limit and 7-limit respectively. It still does not reveal the existence of the 9:5 and 9:7 to casual inspection.</p><p>Of course if you don&apos;t believe in odd limits (only prime) there is no problem. However it is clear to me that odd-limits are useful since scales exist where the fifths (or some of them at least) may be tuned independently of the ninths.</p><p>I still think the above &quot;mixed-o/u&quot; notation is useful since it does show up the consonance and I find it easier to unpack the individual intervals from it than from the otonal or utonal representations.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.
