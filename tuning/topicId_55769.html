Having the 11 available in 2 keys<br/>seems useful.</p><p>So then the question is, as long as the sequence in C was broken before 17,<br/>it might be worth giving up 19 also, which is not used for the C 1-16<br/>sequence or the G 1-12 sequence.  What would be the most useful pitch to put<br/>there (on D#, currently 19)?  Maybe I could leave the otonal scenario to use<br/>it to complete the C minor triad.

Or maybe someone has some different thoughts<br/>entirely.</p><p>Actually I&apos;m thinking about this putting this tuning on my harpsichord.  I&apos;m<br/>also thinking of rooting this scale on F instead of C, so I get C and F as<br/>the good keys.  Then I was also thinking of tuning the bottom octave and<br/>half (from F down) in a subharmonic sequence, the mirror of this harmonic<br/>sequence.  Then I have the possibility of a utonal base with an otonal<br/>treble, so to speak--something that Twining used a lot in the Crysalid<br/>Requiem.

It is a practical matter for<br/>me that C be one of the good keys.  I can choose to root that tuning I<br/>showed in F or C and achieve this.  F root gives me F and C as the good<br/>keys; C root gives me C and G.  My original thought was that I want the<br/>otonal/utonal transition to happen at the root of the tuning, and I wanted<br/>the root to be F so I have almost 1.5 octaves of &quot;otonal space&quot; at the<br/>bottom.  I don&apos;t want it to be 1 octave or 2 octaves.  That was my thinking.<br/>But I might not have to make the otonal/utonal transition on the bottom note<br/>of the tuning.  It might work to have the tuning in C (C and G good keys)<br/>and have the u/o transition on G.  It is worth looking into that possibility<br/>to see how it works, because there are interactions between the utonal and<br/>the otonal sides and I should try all the major possibilities.  Basically<br/>the choices allow these possibilities:</p><p>scale root C allows any combination of:</p><p>    utonal C guide-tone         otonal C root</p><p>    utonal F guide-tone         otonal G root</p><p>scale root F allows any combination of:</p><p>    utonal F guide-tone         otonal F root</p><p>    utonal Bb guide-tone        otonal C root</p><p>This follows from the fact that I plan to simply invert the scale vertically<br/>in the utonal section of the keyboard.  I hope this is clear enough since I<br/>didn&apos;t explain it well.</p><p>The two choices amount to about the same thing except for the relative<br/>positions of the otonal and utonal portions of chords that are built from<br/>both components.  So that&apos;s what I want to check out in advance.</p><p>Maybe there are even other interesting possible choices for where to put the<br/>transition.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Then I was also thinking of tuning the bottom octave and half<br/>&gt;&gt; (from F down) in a subharmonic sequence, the mirror of this<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic sequence.  Then I have the possibility of a utonal<br/>&gt;&gt; base with an otonal treble,<br/>&gt; Not sure I follow.  You&apos;ll have a utonal scale in the bass, but<br/>&gt; you won&apos;t have a diamond -- you won&apos;t be able to walk otonal<br/>&gt; chords down a utonal scale, for instance.</p><p>I can&apos;t have *much* of a diamond in 12 notes.  For now I want to have major<br/>triads in 2 keys since it is possible.  Later I can try other things but<br/>this is my current experiment.</p><p>&gt; Denny would do the coolest piano tunings, interweaving harmonic<br/>&gt; and subharmonic scales like from 20-40 and such, up and down the<br/>&gt; keyboard.  They always sounded fantastic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of his 12-tone repeating scales is:<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Denny Genovese&apos;s superposition of harmonics 8-16 and subharmonics 6-12.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure this is one of the scales you gave me a year ago.  If so, I<br/>never ended up using it.  I&apos;ll try it some day, but for now I want two<br/>&quot;good&quot; keys and I can&apos;t have good otonal in 2 keys if I have good utonal<br/>also woven in, I don&apos;t think, not in 12 notes.</p><p>Personally I found even the 20-some-tone diamond subset (complete through 9,<br/>I think) very limiting, and even the 30-some subset (which included 15).<br/>(I&apos;m talking about the tunings on Norman Henry&apos;s instruments.  Sorry my<br/>memory is so bad about the details but I don&apos;t have time to correct this<br/>now.)  I would want to expand it more, as some have described I think having<br/>2 instances of the diamond a fifth apart.  That would do the trick, I think.<br/>That&apos;s kind of what I&apos;m approaching (weakly) with this tuning idea.  I think<br/>I can have some utonal and otonal choices in 2 keys by limiting what part of<br/>the keyboard the utonal and otonal appear in.  I really like what Twining<br/>did with utonal bass and otonal soprano.  I can&apos;t achieve that freedom of<br/>modulation but having 2 keys is a great start.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=55789 href="#55789">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2004 6:29:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I really like what Twining id with utonal bass and otonal<br/>&gt;soprano.</p><p>Any time indexes you&apos;d cite as good examples?</p><p>&gt;I can&apos;t achieve that freedom of modulation but<br/>&gt;having 2 keys is a great start.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=55790 href="#55790">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2004 6:56:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 8/23/04 11:58 AM, Jacob &lt;<a href="mailto:jbarton@rice.edu">jbarton@rice.edu</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; I was just thinking about altering the rather standard 12-tone harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt; scale that we&apos;ve talked about before.

So here&apos;s a little<br/>multiplication table in which I left out the duplicate numbers:</p><p>    *   6   7   9   11<br/>    6   36  42  54  66<br/>    7       49  63  77<br/>    9           81  99<br/>    11              121</p><p>So dividing each of those 10 resulting numbers by 72 or 36 or 18 to get the<br/>correct octave results yields (unsorted):</p><p>36/18   =   2/1<br/>42/36   =   7/6<br/>54/36   =   3/2<br/>66/36   =   11/6<br/>49/36   =   49/36   (missing from tetratetra.scl)<br/>63/36   =   7/4<br/>77/36   =   77/36<br/>81/72   =   9/8<br/>99/72   =   11/8<br/>121/72  =   121/72</p><p>Comparing to your list:</p><p>&gt; 77/72<br/>&gt; 12/11<br/>&gt; 9/8<br/>&gt; 7/6<br/>&gt; 14/11<br/>&gt; 11/8<br/>&gt; 3/2<br/>&gt; 18/11<br/>&gt; 121/72<br/>&gt; 7/4<br/>&gt; 11/6<br/>&gt; 2/1</p><p>reveals the extra 12/11 (in addition to 14/11 and 18/11) and the missing<br/>49/36.</p><p>Gee I wonder if you (via scala) separated them by 11:9:7:6 like I was<br/>suggesting as an alternative (did you notice?) instead of 6:7:9:11?  If so<br/>you really *did* make a diamond.  This would explain the 11 denominators.<br/>But that&apos;s an exercise for another day.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=55798 href="#55798">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2004 2:38:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>  That is you are taking all possible<br/>&gt; products of 6,7,9,11 with 6,7,9,11 (and then reducing and octave<br/>adjusting<br/>&gt; the results), whereas a diamond takes for example all ratios of<br/>1,3,5,7,9<br/>&gt; with 1,3,5,7,9.</p><p>Which makes it a combination product set.
