You might check the wiki page on APS&apos;s - we<br/>started documenting a bunch of random observations around this concept<br/>and made some open questions.

There is precious little that sounds major/minor to me, rather, I hear my usual kinds of interpretations, yellow flowers on drooping leaves, arm moves as if picking up a glass, and so on.</p><p>As far as functionality, I hear strong functional movement, and would be puzzled as to why others would not.</p><p>As far as tonality, I think I hear some different tonics than you do, judging by your comments and demonstration.

A long time ago I noticed that the 200-cent 2nd in a minor tetrachord in 12-ET sounds &apos;minor&apos; whereas the 200-cent 2nd in the major tetrachord sounds &apos;major&apos;.  That is, when primed with the corresponding tetrachord, the 2nd alone sounds either major or minor.  You get that too?

It&apos;s clear there is also a &quot;sensory&quot; (purely psychoacoustic) aspect available to these percepts.  This &quot;sensory&quot; aspect is the easiet to study.  I also think it&apos;s a bit of a necessary condition.  Sure, you can probably write a piece that makes 4:5:6 sound dissonant and resolve to a 10:12:15.  Somebody could probably make a whole musical career / genre out of doing such things.  But it&apos;ll never erase the distinction between concordant JI chords and a bunch of notes mashed together.  Psychoacoustic consonance is far from the only building block of music, but it *is* a building block.  Further, a scale that provides a lot of accurately-tuned JI chords is capable of almost as much dissonance as a scale that doesn&apos;t.  The reverse isn&apos;t true.</p><p>I thought all of this was consensus and I&apos;m not sure why you keep emphasizing it.  If you agree to stop emphasizing it, I agree to take you more seriously.  Ok, you do mention that others have been saying it.  You only mention folks on the lists.  Pretty much everyone in cognitive psychology and psychoacoustics and even trad. theory acknowledges it!  You and I have talked about it dozens of times!  As far back as 2008, I think I said it has little to do with intonation and requires very different techniques to study (I also expressed skepticism that it could ever be rigorously understood).</p><p>I would love to know who you are &apos;quoting&apos; at 15:40 about 8/7 controling the perception of &apos;2ndness&apos;.  I have never heard anyone make this argument!</p><p>You say your goal is to discover new musical feelings.  I would suggest using a scale with a different rank-order-matrix than the diatonic scale, and preferably a different number of notes/octave.  Primes larger than 5 can help too.  But perhaps it will take a large body of music written in another system to really grow these gestalts.  I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Again, interesting and impressive demo.

I&apos;m gonna do some more videos like this that<br/>don&apos;t have the 15 minute theory discussion, which I think people will<br/>enjoy more. I&apos;d also like to be more ambitious in the solo - the first<br/>time I did this demo it was for Keenan on IRC, and I was doing a lot<br/>more exotic sounding stuff, like going up a half step and playing out<br/>of key temporarily and resolving back in (what jazz people call<br/>playing &quot;out&quot;, like Coltrane or whatever).</p><p>At one point I was exploring superimposing machine over the scale.<br/>Keenan&apos;s reaction was that it sounded weird and out of key and<br/>disorganized, so I thought I&apos;d temper it down a bit.

On the right, there&apos;s another way<br/>to see this in which it looks like he has a very wide mouth - this is<br/>another way of interpreting the picture you see. It&apos;s all ambiguous<br/>and at every juncture you tend towards the &quot;most likely<br/>interpretation&quot; of what&apos;s going on.

Sometimes one thing would work again, whereas other things<br/>which didn&apos;t work would then work. Do you hear it as neutral when I<br/>hit the third at 2:52? I accidentally hit the 300 cent third, but I<br/>liked it because I thought it sounded neutral, so I went up to the<br/>neutral sixth as well. And I mean &quot;neutral&quot; in the sense that it<br/>sounded like it was right in between scale degrees or something.</p><p>Also, I&apos;ve played this scale now a lot, so I can follow it mentally in<br/>a way that&apos;s removed some of the distortions that were present when I<br/>was first learning it. Could be an instance of a ROM improving with<br/>training or something.</p><p>&gt; Most of the resolutions came off for me, but the tritone sub didn&apos;t sound<br/>&gt; like a tritone sub at all to me.</p><p>Do you hear a tritone in the melody at 1:14 for instance? It sounds<br/>like it&apos;s going C-F#-F, Eb-F-Eb-C-Bb-G-C. Or in general, I try to do<br/>some blues scale stuff.</p><p>&gt; When you talk about the 225-cent interval sounding like a &apos;happy&apos; major<br/>&gt; second farther up in the scale, I agree.

I think there&apos;s more than one type of<br/>dissonance, and the sort that you&apos;re talking about here is a very<br/>low-level sort of &quot;sensory dissonance&quot; that isn&apos;t so much related to<br/>the fact that minor sounds sad and</p><p>&gt; I thought all of this was consensus and I&apos;m not sure why you keep<br/>&gt; emphasizing it. If you agree to stop emphasizing it, I agree to take you<br/>&gt; more seriously.</p><p>I couldn&apos;t honestly care less at this point how seriously you take me.<br/>Maybe if you stop being a jerk, others will take YOU more seriously.<br/>After reading this sentence I&apos;m not going to bother replying to the<br/>rest of your post.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104636 href="#104636">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2012 12:55:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, May 25, 2012 at 6:26 AM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The piece was obviously concieved of with major/minor thinking, and<br/>&gt; diatonic scale thinking.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (I would not be so sure it was concieved of entirely in 12-tET thinking- I<br/>&gt; would guess that an important reason why the very little jazz I truly enjoy<br/>&gt; comes from a handful of older musicians is they don&apos;t really think in<br/>&gt; 12-tET, Ornette Coleman being the prime example.)</p><p>Well, it&apos;s conceived in Western thinking, whatever it is.

I<br/>&gt; accidentally hit the 300 cent third, but I liked it because<br/>&gt; I thought it sounded neutral, so I went up to the neutral<br/>&gt; sixth as well. And I mean &quot;neutral&quot; in the sense that it<br/>&gt; sounded like it was right in between scale degrees or something.</p><p>I went back to listen to it.  It&apos;s brief but it sounds more<br/>neutral there, yep.  You&apos;re coming down to it so I don&apos;t<br/>get the tonic to compare just there.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Most of the resolutions came off for me, but the tritone<br/>&gt; &gt; sub didn&apos;t sound like a tritone sub at all to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you hear a tritone in the melody at 1:14 for instance?<br/>&gt; It sounds like it&apos;s going C-F#-F, Eb-F-Eb-C-Bb-G-C.

You get that too? (It&apos;s not<br/>&gt; &gt; Rothenberg-ambiguous)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hear the ambience of the third coloring the perception of<br/>&gt; the bare second in general. The same happens with a bare fifth.<br/>&gt; However, I don&apos;t hear the second sound &quot;minor&quot; in the same<br/>&gt; sense that the thing above sounds like a minor third.</p><p>Hm.  I also get it in the bare fifth.  To me I think it&apos;s<br/>the same thing as the 225-cent interval here.  The<br/>Rothenberg ambiguity may help (I&apos;ve sometimes suggested<br/>ambiguous intervals might be portals for melodic modulation),<br/>I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think the demo would have been more interesting if more<br/>&gt; &gt; than one timbre was exhibited.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could do another one, but I definitely have no time now.</p><p>Just a general comment.</p><p>&gt; It sounds like crap with piano - almost anything sounds like<br/>&gt; crap with a piano timbre except for 12-EDO for me, no matter<br/>&gt; how accurate it is.</p><p>Really?
