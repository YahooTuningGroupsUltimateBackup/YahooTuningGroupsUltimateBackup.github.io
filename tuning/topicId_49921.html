Thank you.</p><p>  Hi Andrew,</p><p>  I don&apos; know the Ztar but I know that the &quot;FM7&quot; of Native Instruments<br/>supports the MIDI data format &quot;Scale Octave Tuning Real Time&quot;. With this<br/>data format it is possible to control every MIDI Note to &quot;every frequency&quot;<br/>by a fineness of about 1/164 Cents &quot;in abstract&quot;. There exists also a second<br/>instrument at Native Instruments which supports this data format, but I<br/>forgot the name. You can ask Michael Kurz at Native Instruments:<br/>        <a href="mailto:michael@native-instruments.de">michael@native-instruments.de</a></p><p>   &quot;In abstract&quot; means: I don&apos;t know whether the internal system of this<br/>instrument supports such a high fineness. Ask Michael Kurz.<br/>  &quot;Every frequency&quot; means every frequency between the deepest and the<br/>highest tone of the referred instrument</p><p>  There exist, too, physical electronic instruments which support this data<br/>format: All actual VIRUS syntesizers of ACCESS:<br/>  <a href="http://www.kemper-digital.com">www.kemper-digital.com</a><br/>  These instruments support this tuning fineness not only &quot;in abstract&quot; but,<br/>too, in reality.</p><p>  Informations in the MIDI data format &quot;Scale Octave Tuning Real Time&quot; you<br/>will find at<br/>  <a href="http://www.midi.org">www.midi.org</a></p><p>  If you will not find them I can send you these informations directly. In<br/>this case please write me by<br/>  <a href="mailto:wmohrlok@hermode.com">wmohrlok@hermode.com</a></p><p>  Werner Mohrlok</p><p>  __________________________________<br/>  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>  New Yahoo!

It&apos;s a fine instrument, it plays well, and is nice for<br/>microtonal work because its not a one dimensional array.<br/>Of course, it still isnt perfect...</p><p>I use a lot of different software - Max is great for customizing<br/>the interface and for doing the kinds of adaptive tuning things.<br/>I also use Bitheadz Unity as a software sampler<br/>(reasonable tuning table support). I also use a (hardware)<br/>sampler, an ASR-10.</p><p>In case you haven&apos;t heard it, most of the music on my<br/>website was played with the Ztar<br/>and then multitracked... all of it is in non-12 tunings:</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/otherperson/all_mp3s.html</a></p><p>As for what scales to use for the fretboard - this is a vast<br/>terrain. I find that with each new tuning or temperament I try a<br/>bunch of things and then settle on one that seems to work.<br/>I have yet to find any universal principles though I toss<br/>out a few ideas at:</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/alternatetunings/alternatetunings.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/alternatetunings/alternatetunings.html</a></p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
