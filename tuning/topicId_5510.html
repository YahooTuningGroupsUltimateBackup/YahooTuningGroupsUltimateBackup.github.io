So that<br/>consumers know about the different prices and quality of goods. But<br/>culture is inherently different from washing machines.<br/>In the Netherlands we have a Ministry of Culture that wants there to<br/>be a flourishing musical life and works to make all kinds of music<br/>performances accessible to people from all layers in society and I<br/>think that&apos;s good. Of course this costs money. Without it, a lot of<br/>things, like concerts with Partch&apos;s music, are impossible. It would<br/>make the broad choice there is here a lot narrower.<br/>Composers from the past also needed their support from kings, etc.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div><h3><a id=5517 href="#5517">ðŸ”—</a>alves@xxxxx.xx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>10/15/1999 9:40:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This bashing of the free market is complete nonsense.

For all the advantages and power of the free market,<br/>and it has brought us a lot of good things, it has serious shortcomings<br/>that I don&apos;t think we should be blind to, especially in regards to a<br/>preservation and development of art and culture:</p><p>o The free market by its (or human) nature judges value over a short<br/>  time period, whereas much art fully appreciates its value only over a<br/>  period of decades, even centuries.

(I believe Mozart was<br/>poverty stricken due to a gambling addiction.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;o The free market also tends to devote 100% of its effort towards what<br/>&gt;  90% of the consumers want, especially in a field with limited resources,<br/>&gt;  such as the media or retail shelf space.

I<br/>don&apos;t understand what this boogy man &quot;the free market&quot; is if its not the<br/>people who buy what they want and the people who sell them what they want,<br/>and people free to invent and create whatever they want with the promise<br/>that if society finds it of value, they will be compensated.. If everyone<br/>wanted to listen to microtonal music you can bet there would be lots of it<br/>being made marketed and bought, but thats simply not the case. You can<br/>lament the musical level of the &quot;philistines&quot; but thats just sour grapes.<br/>Sure, I sometimes wonder why a lawyer with a few years of schooling and only<br/>a talent for twisting language and truth gets $250/hour and I can barely pay<br/>my rent teaching guitar lessons with 20 years of experience. I&apos;d still<br/>rather be a broke musician than a lawyer. If I wanted to be a &quot;rich&quot;<br/>musician, I am totally free to play guitar or bass in a commercially viable<br/>rock band. The only problem with freedom is theres no one to blame for your<br/>own situation.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;o The free market values advertising hype over education, because the<br/>&gt;  former is more reliable in selling a product, regardless of quality.<br/>&gt;  I am sickened by the local Disney radio station, which spends much of<br/>&gt;  its time trying to convince my *5-year-old* son that, to be accepted in<br/>&gt;  his peer group, he needs to be listening to whatever 13-year-old hip<br/>&gt;  hop singer they&apos;re marketing this month.</p><p>Just like porn on the internet and all similar issues its the responsibility<br/>of the parent to monitor and/or control the childs experience. You cant<br/>expect the world to conform to what you want your five year old to see and<br/>hear. Change the station or turn the radio off. On the other hand, why not<br/>let the younger generation have whatever kind of music they want? Thanks to<br/>the technology comming out of the free market there is less and less<br/>limitations in what is available, so people have less and less excuse for<br/>not making their own choices.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;o As dismissive as some fundamentalist free-marketeers are of the idea<br/>&gt;  of value that cannot be measured in monetary terms, I don&apos;t think we<br/>&gt;  should be teaching our children that everything has a price, and, that<br/>&gt;  if it cannot sell enough right now to break even, it&apos;s worthless.</p><p>So don&apos;t teach your children that. If you don&apos;t like what they&apos;re seeing on<br/>the tv, turn it off or throw it out. If you don&apos;t like what they&apos;re being<br/>taught in school, homeschool them. Go out and use the free market to make<br/>enough money to hire them a private tutor that has the same worldview as<br/>you.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;I have no problem with super-hyped mega-marketed pop groups selling as many<br/>&gt;CDs and concert tickets as they want, but I think it will be a tragic day<br/>&gt;for our culture when that&apos;s all there is.</p><p>And why would that ever happen? Geeze, Bill, both you and I have on our<br/>websites soundfiles of our music that anyone in the world can listen to 24<br/>hours a day! This is so totally unprecedented in musical history that I&apos;m<br/>almost swooning as I think about it! Don&apos;t you see that it was in the past<br/>that there was no freedom- you could only hear what was played live, the<br/>composer had to please the patron, most people were living on a survival<br/>level and had no time for art...etc.</p><p>Didn&apos;t someone say &quot;The American system is the worst, except for all the<br/>other ones&quot;? Its only what we make it. As Carl said, if someone wrote tons<br/>of mindblowing microtonal music that was utterly unique, not only would it<br/>&quot;open up the canon&quot;, but it would get out there in bulk AND the composer<br/>would have a nice bank account. The free market would see to it. We just<br/>have to face the fact that none of us have written tons of mind blowing<br/>music yet. Were the Spice Girls and their music mind blowing? Maybe not to<br/>you and me, but if you look at the crowds of kids at their shows, somebody<br/>was getting their mind blown and loving it. Is it for us to judge other<br/>peoples ecstacy? I think not.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=5526 href="#5526">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/1999 8:38:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rosati&apos;s post was excellent.

The CD was developed by Philips, with help from the Dutch<br/>government, and Sony, which has been basically a subsidiary of Japan Inc.<br/>The Internet was developed not by consumer demand in a market but by tax<br/>dollars funding DARPA. Today government manipulation of the technology<br/>market continues with subsidies for research, internet infrastructure, and<br/>controls of technology imports/exports.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that these are bad (they seem to have produced very<br/>successful results in fact), just that, contrary to what Frederick Hayek<br/>seems to claim, I would say that no market is completely &quot;free.&quot;<br/>Governments and money interests have always and will continue to manipulate<br/>markets for different reasons, including (hopefully) the overall good of<br/>society. Thus we have complicated tax laws that give breaks for things like<br/>research, charitable contributions, saving money, buying a house, and on<br/>and on and on.</p><p>If we recognize that not every ill of society can be solved through pure<br/>market forces and that it is a legitimate and on-going government role to<br/>help encourage the market in socially positive directions, then why not<br/>support for arts and culture which are valuable but not otherwise<br/>commercially viable?</p><p>To my complaint that Radio Disney was trying to hype products to my<br/>five-year-old, Dante sensitively replied:</p><p>&gt;Just like porn on the internet and all similar issues its the responsibility<br/>&gt;of the parent to monitor and/or control the childs experience.

Commercialism: love it or leave it?<br/>For your information, I do keep the radio off that channel when I can. I do<br/>control what he watches on TV. I do try to instill in him values that I<br/>think are important.</p><p>But should I have to remove him from all the positive attributes of public<br/>education and go live in the woods if I disagree with you? Should I have to<br/>make sure that he doesn&apos;t talk to anyone? Should I have to create my own<br/>country because I don&apos;t like some aspects of this culture? Should I have to<br/>refrain from expressing my alarm about ill effects I perceive in<br/>commercialism because it&apos;s the Law of the Land?
