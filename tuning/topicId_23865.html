So one could take this 13 tone subset and look at all the 9 tone<br/>MOS&apos;s of that. There are some pelogs (the 5 tone MOS on this page) that get close to this although<br/>the final small step might be too small.

Mats, your own thoughts on this would probably be<br/>essential here (since it&apos;s your piece).</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
