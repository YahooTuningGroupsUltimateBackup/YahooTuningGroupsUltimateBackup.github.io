It seems to provide a neat solution<br/>to the JI problem of the supertonic in some contexts.

This has two short, slow passages for<br/>unaccompanied choir in which choral tuning is totally exposed and<br/>essential to the effect.</p><p>I have reduced the chords (including all passing &apos;dissonances&apos;) to<br/>root position and will simply state the ratios of each note above the<br/>root. Then what remains is to specify the relations of each root to<br/>the tonic. In adaptive JI the roots would not be in JI relations to<br/>each other, they would be tempered by some meantone.

Are you referring to adaptive tunings of common practice music?</p><p>In a meantone system, 7/5 is representable by an augmented fourth, and<br/>10/7 by a diminished fifth, and the two are distinguished. However, no<br/>distinction is made between 10/9, 9/8, and 28/25; they are all just a<br/>tone. (9/8)/(28/25) = 225/224 and (28/25)/(10/9) = 126/125, and if you<br/>temper out both small intervals, the result is (septimal) meantone.<br/>It&apos;s also quite practical to just temper out one of them, and for<br/>example merge 9/8 with 28/25 but leave 10/9 as a distinct interval. If<br/>you detune 5-limit JI slightly (for example, by using 72-et, or even<br/>228-et, the 12x19 system) you get an excellent practical method for<br/>working a lot of septimal harmony into an initially 5-limit JI scale.</p><p>But, of course, this is a fixed tuning I am talking about.</p><p>&gt; It seems to provide a neat solution<br/>&gt; to the JI problem of the supertonic in some contexts. That is, rather<br/>&gt; than choose between 9:8 and 10:9, one may use 28:25, which is derived<br/>&gt; via 5:4 and 7:5, if the chord includes a dim5.</p><p>That becomes a meantone system if you carry it out consistently. That<br/>is, if you are going to make 56/25 an exact interval, and also the<br/>result of two fifths in succession, then your fifth should be exactly<br/> sqrt(56/25) = (2/5)*sqrt(14) = 698.099 cents. That&apos;s about 2/11 comma,<br/>an excellent meantone tuning if you like the 1/5 to 1/6 comma range.</p><p>&gt; To my current opinion 5-limit JI (adaptive or not) is optimal only for<br/>&gt; triadic harmony.

Are you referring to adaptive tunings of common practice music?</p><p>I guess I am. Or in fact, in the example I gave, 7-limit JI tuning of<br/>common practice music. There I was somewhat lucky, in that strict JI<br/>did not entail any shifts as large as a syntonic comma in the passages<br/>I quoted.</p><p>This sounds theoretically crazy, but I hope to show that it might be<br/>quite consonant with the actual musical practice of the time. I am<br/>well aware that almost all common practice *theorists* strongly<br/>disapproved of 7-limit. From what I understand of formal<br/>common-practice harmony, so far as any well-defined tuning scheme was<br/>imagined (which was rarely!) it would be adaptive 5-limit JI a la<br/>Vicentino. This theory also forbade unprepared dissonance such as<br/>dominant 7ths, let alone unprepared augmented intervals.</p><p>However, it is also clear that very many keyboard instruments in the<br/>English Baroque (for example) would be in a meantone very close to the<br/>ones you describe, in which aug 6ths and 4ths, for example, would turn<br/>out as near-exact 7-limit intervals. So I deduce that good<br/>representations of the 7-limit *were* part of the late Baroque<br/>sound-world, whenever these intervals were introduced. Whether or not<br/>theorists mentioned them, people heard them!</p><p>(There is for example one English meantone tuning instruction that<br/>says to check if Bb-D-F-Ab (tuned as G#) and Eb-G-Bb-Db (C#) are &apos;good<br/>chords&apos;.)</p><p>Also, as I noted in my experience of singing the Schumann Mass, if a<br/>chord is voiced to have a tritone between the lowest parts, and the<br/>voices are free to adjust to one another, it is difficult to *avoid*<br/>singing a 7:5. (E.g. with voicing F-B-D-G.) It is simply easier to<br/>tune! At least, that is how I interpreted what happened when this<br/>chord sounded unexpectedly &apos;together&apos;. Now I simply hypothesize that<br/>Baroque singers may also have found the 7:5 tritone to be an attractor<br/>- without taking them far out of the way of familiar meantones, and<br/>without even knowing they were singing a septimal interval.</p><p>The proof of the pudding would be in the eating - if the 7-limit JI<br/>tunings I propose for unaccompanied choir sound (in some currently<br/>ill-defined way) like Handel, then they should be accepted as a<br/>possible common practice tuning. This would imply that previous<br/>performances of those bits of Handel had been approximating 7-limit<br/>without knowing it! But, if they sound like barbershop or Turkish<br/>music instead, then by all means throw them out!</p><p>&gt; &gt; To my current opinion 5-limit JI (adaptive or not) is optimal only for<br/>&gt; &gt; triadic harmony. (...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;optimal&quot;?</p><p>Very simply, that every consonant chord has a tuning which is<br/>obviously as consonant as possible. But if your repertoire of chords<br/>extends to unprepared dominant 7ths, the tuning of the 7th becomes<br/>doubtful between 9/5 and 16/9. I am proposing that 50/28 can also be a<br/>solution, in certain contexts, due to the 10/7 ratio with the major<br/>3rd. The rationale becomes stronger in aug6 chords, such as F-A-B-D#<br/>in my example. Also dim5 or dim7: the dim 5th and dim 7th intervals<br/>become difficult to tune by ear, or involve large comma shifts (or<br/>deviations from a prevailing meantone) if done by superimposed pure<br/>m3&apos;s. Whereas if done by interlocking pure m3 and 7:5&apos;s they are both<br/>tunable by ear and stay quite close to historically common meantones.</p><p>My underlying thought is that singers would instinctively &apos;want&apos; to<br/>sing pure intervals, and a meantone continuo might suggest to them<br/>pure septimal dim 5ths, tritones and aug 6ths - such that they might<br/>have simply found these intervals easy to sing in tune, if and when a<br/>continuo chord died away and they were sufficiently close. Just as a<br/>meantone continuo would suggest a near-pure 5th and the singers could<br/>adjust it minutely towards a pure one.</p><p>As a first aural step towards seeing whether this makes sense, I would<br/>accept (in place of 7-limit JI) the compromise meantone in which the<br/>aug6 is pure 7:4 and thus 5:4 and 7:5 have equal (and tiny)<br/>deviations. This is also extremely close to 31-EDO.

I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t see any plausible tuning for these other than 5-limit JI (or<br/>&gt; adaptive when needed) - assuming that the singers knew what a pure<br/>&gt; 5th and a pure 3rd sounded like. Temperament was and is not<br/>&gt; necessary.</p><p>Agree.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think Baroque music would sound cool in septimal JI, and for<br/>&gt; &gt; all we know it could have been performed this way.  However, I<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t think it was.  Here&apos;s why:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; . When and why was the practice lost?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When keyboards stopped being tuned mainly in 1/4- or 1/5- comma<br/>&gt; meantone.</p><p>There are very few examples of the aug 6th being used in a<br/>septimal 7th sort of way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; their sound is generally very foreign in Western music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it would not be to those who played music on those meantone<br/>&gt; keyboards,</p><p>I still think it would be.</p><p>&gt; But I am considering places where 1) such dim/aug &apos;dissonances&apos;<br/>&gt; occur unprepared and 2) have to be tuned above the bass or above<br/>&gt; a neighboring voice. Even though these intervals were treated as<br/>&gt; dissonances, it is plausible that they could most easily and<br/>&gt; stably be tuned in practice by pure ratios.</p><p>If you can find a recording of a late baroque piece with a<br/>septimal dim5 used more than once I&apos;d love to hear it.</p><p>&gt; pray for absence of fog!</p><p>Very well; I will.  :)</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=68534 href="#68534">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2006 10:06:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Me too!
