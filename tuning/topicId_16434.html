This is the familiar 7-out-of-12.</p><p>A three-stepsize [2,2,3] three-term series example would be:</p><p>2, 2, 3, 7, 12, 22, 41, ...</p><p>And a+b+c is the subset of the sum of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th terms<br/>where a=2, b=3, and c=4. This would be the familiar syntonic diatonic<br/>as a 7-out-of-22.</p><p>A four-stepsize [2,2,1,2] four-term series example would be:</p><p>2, 2, 1, 2, 7, 12, 22, 43, 84, ...</p><p>And a+b+c+d is the subset of the sum of terms 4, 5, 6, and 7, and a=4,<br/>b=6, c=7, and d=8. This would be a 7-out-of-43 scale.</p><p>I can&apos;t see much reason to extend this idea much beyond this four-term<br/>point, though one of course could by using the same methods.</p><p>Generalizing n-term series so that they have a built-in ordering rule<br/>analogous to the single generator of the two-term series seems to me<br/>to hinge on generalizing the M-out-of-N idea. In other words, as a<br/>two-term series results in an M-out-of-N, a three-term series should<br/>result in an L-out-of-M-out-of-N, and so forth and so on up the n-term<br/>series chain...</p><p>But if each new series is viewed as a parallel to the two-term, then<br/>they also carry a stepsize condition that does not always agree with<br/>the generalized the M-out-of-N idea.</p><p>For example if you take a [1,1,3] index, you&apos;d have a 5-tone subset of<br/>17 equal where a=2, b=3, and c=4. But a[1,1,3] L-out-of-M-out-of-N<br/>would give a 0 4 8 9 13 17 scale of 4+4+1+4+4. No good.</p><p>However, taking L-out-of-M-out-of-N back to the two-generator idea<br/>would give an 0 1 5 9 14 17 scale of 1+4+4+5+3:</p><p>   5----14<br/>  / \   / \<br/> /   \ /   \<br/>0-----9-----1</p><p>This in turn could then be readdressed with the three-term series rule<br/>of a=2, b=3, and c=4 as a 2+4+4+4+3.</p><p>This, while not nearly as &quot;elegant&quot; as I had hoped, seems to work.</p><p>If so, then this should allow for a generalized &quot;scaled by P rule&quot;<br/>which is what I was after, but had given up on (and now I remember<br/>why!), even before Paul brought all this up.</p><p>Here&apos;s the basic idea again...</p><p>Let stepsizes be small to large alphabetized variables so that<br/>two-stepsize = [a,b], three-stepsize = [a,b,c] and so forth and so on<br/>where the alphabetized variables are any whole numbers.</p><p>Then assign each variable an uppercase fixed size:</p><p>A = (LOG(2)-LOG(1))*(1200/LOG(2))<br/>B = (LOG(3)-LOG(1))*(1200/LOG(2))<br/>C = (LOG(4)-LOG(1))*(1200/LOG(2))</p><p>etc.</p><p>This will be our fixed interval template, and will allow for a<br/>convenient (and aurally agreeable) distribution of stepsizes amongst<br/>any [a,b,...] index:</p><p>a/b = log(3)/log(2)<br/>c/b = log (4)/log(3)<br/>d/c = log(5)/log(4)</p><p>etc.</p><p>Next you scale a given [a,b,...] index by a given periodicity (P).<br/>This will give us a percentage (X) to scale the fixed A,B,... interval<br/>template with.</p><p>So for a two-stepsize index you&apos;d have:</p><p>(a*A)+(b*B)/P = X</p><p>For a three-stepsize index:</p><p>(a*A)+(b*B)+(c*C)/P = X</p><p>And so forth and so on...</p><p>Now A/X, B/X,... will give a given [a,b,...] index corresponding<br/>stepsizes scaled to P.</p><p>Here&apos;s the previous [1,1,3] &quot;Tribonacci&quot; example where a/b =<br/>log(3)/log(2), c/b = log (4)/log(3), and d/c = log(5)/log(4):</p><p>0 140 419 699  978 1200<br/>0 280 559 839 1060 1200<br/>0 280 559 781  920 1200<br/>0 280 501 641  920 1200<br/>0 222 361 641  920 1200</p><p>Anyway, this is the basic idea... but what I&apos;m still looking for is a<br/>less wobbly generalization of the M-out-of-N idea; too much voodoo is<br/>required as it stands now.</p><p>Any thing come to mind?</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
