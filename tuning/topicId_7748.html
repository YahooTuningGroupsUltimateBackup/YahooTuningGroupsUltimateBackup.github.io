Occasionally I get an email from school teachers (usually music<br/>teachers) who play my examples to their classrooms to get opinions.</p><p>&gt;However, I think the mussorgsky piece could be improved<br/>&gt;because the buzzy timbre of the trumpet interferes with<br/>&gt;perceiving the differences (the JI version sounds buzzy<br/>&gt;like a chain saw to the uninitiated)</p><p>Yeah, it sounds a little buzzy on my sound card too.  I think I was<br/>sticking to the original instruments.  (Actually the original instrument<br/>was a piano, until Ravel orchestrated it.)</p><p>&gt;Can you change your file so you use a more pure-toned<br/>&gt;general MIDI instrument?  Flute perhaps, or the pure<br/>&gt;sine wave patch?  I think this would demonstrate it<br/>&gt;better.</p><p>Okay, I don&apos;t think General MIDI includes a sine wave patch - if it does, I<br/>don&apos;t know where or how to do it.  But I created versions that use the<br/>Flute patch, and the Recorder patch (which seems to be closer to a sine<br/>wave).  I put &apos;em up at:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/timbre">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/timbre</a></p><p>My sound card gave the flute a lot of vibrato, which makes it hard to hear<br/>the subtle tuning differences.  The recorder patch seemed to have no vibrato.</p><p>Both flute and recorder mainly consisted of the first and second harmonic<br/>only, whereas the trumpet patch had components from harmonics 1 thru 9.</p><p>HOWEVER (all caps make this a &quot;big&quot; however), it is theorized that<br/>harmonics play a big role in whether chords are consonant or dissonant.<br/>Taking away the harmonics, by using sine waves, flutes, or recorders may<br/>actually make the ET version just as consonant as the JI version.</p><p>Here&apos;s my understanding of the theory:  take, for example, a C and an E,<br/>played at the same time, on harmonically-rich instruments (i.e., lots of<br/>harmonics, like a trumpet).  They&apos;ll be in tune if the 5th harmonic of the<br/>first note equals the 4th harmonic of the second note:</p><p>  harmonics of C   harmonics of E<br/>  --------------   --------------<br/>   5th harm = E  =  4th harm = E<br/>   4th harm = C<br/>                    3rd harm = B<br/>   3rd harm = G<br/>                    2nd harm = E<br/>   2nd harm = C<br/>                    1st harm = E<br/>   1st harm = C</p><p>But if you use tones like sine waves that don&apos;t have harmonics, there will<br/>be no conflict in the upper partials, so the above dissonance will not be<br/>perceived.  (That&apos;s the theory anyway.)</p><p>So lemme know what you and your friends think.
