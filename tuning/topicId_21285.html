I said I&apos;d reply back to your post of Skip&apos;s<br/>of a couple days ago, but will do so when there is time to do it<br/>justice (and there is merit in what Skip says).</p><p>However, this reminds me of the days of John Chalmer&apos;s posting the<br/>writings of Brian McLaren (again, that name!), which meant that<br/>anything he said was one-way. Invite Skip to join the list, Johnny,<br/>even for a short time -- if the only discussion we had (Skip and I)<br/>was one message, but he got to share some of his thoughts on<br/>instrument making, I *know* that would be of value to the list.</p><p>I also asked you, kindly, if you had his email address so I could<br/>write and assure him that while strongly worded (and in non-tuneable<br/>ASCII), personal enmity was not my game. I tried the two emails I<br/>found in a web search, but they were no-go. If you (and he) feel like<br/>sharing, it would make for better communication.</p><p>Assuming communication and discussion are valid, which I think they<br/>are.</p><p>Just one point in this lengthy and somewhat... well, this lengthy<br/>post:</p><p>&gt; Partch was an original.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; To insist that the trappings<br/>&gt; of an instrument that Harry didn&apos;t build somehow moves within<br/>&gt; that part of the Partch orbit is beyond idiotic.</p><p>Not if the instrument is for use in playing his music, as the visual<br/>was as vital as the aural. Any other use? Not only non-idiotic, but<br/>all trappings of any sort are extremely welcomed. In case you missed<br/>that point.</p><p>&gt; But mostly I managed to address most of the issues that seemed to<br/>&gt; need it.&nbsp; And established myself as forever outside the Partch<br/>&gt; camp.&nbsp; As I said, let&apos;s let the historians straighten it all out<br/>&gt; in 25 years.</p><p>Funny you say that (or, &quot;he&quot; says it): Partch died only 26 years ago,<br/>and because of raft of genetically altered performance ideologies<br/>that are springing up as he decomposes, it will be too late. So the<br/>way I look at it (realizing that getting most people to look outside<br/>their *own* prejudices on performance and look into *Partch&apos;s* has<br/>about as much chance of succeeding as Ivor Darreg had at winning a<br/>Pulitzer), I&apos;ll just sit around and chronicle the strip malling of<br/>his grand attempt at something different, something unique.</p><p>If for no other reason than ...</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Lydia Ayers &#x3C;LAYERS@CS.UST.HK&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2001 1:03:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hmmm, maybe it&apos;s because of jet lag, since I&apos;ve barely returned from<br/>the States, but I don&apos;t understand this discussion about Skip<br/>LaPlant&apos;s kithara.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen and hreard both the original and Skip&apos;s imitation, and<br/>I frankly can&apos;t tell the difference.

Sure I used Brian&apos;s<br/>own statements -- to point out just how dumb they were. I have not<br/>reviewed those pages in a while. If what he says about *you* is<br/>incorrect, and you would like to forward those comments to me, I will<br/>put editorial remarks in them within an hour. You have never asked<br/>for them to actually be *removed*, but I certainly understand that<br/>you have a problem with them.</p><p>And, in light of all of your recent remarks regarding them, you will<br/>be pleased to know that they will taken them down, and be replaced<br/>with a new essay on these matters, following the March 26th Partch<br/>Centennial at UCLA.</p><p>&gt; For the record, I forwarded all of Szanto&apos;s posts to Skip, and<br/>&gt; asked whether he wanted to have his e-mail address made public</p><p>I would never ask that it be made public.

Neither do I, no matter<br/>&gt; how enjoyable it is to others on the list.</p><p>No matter how many times I say this, I have not done it in jest or<br/>for entertainment purposes. I have spoken on direct issues, if<br/>strongly. If you have something to say about that, fine. I don&apos;t<br/>think, in an objective light, that my comments were as incendiary as<br/>the responses.</p><p>&gt; I no longer want to deal with Danlee&apos;s proxy on the list.  It is<br/>&gt; demeaning and destructive of music making.</p><p>I speak for myself, not Danlee, though I know we share similar<br/>sentiments. I was trying to speak to larger issues, as well, but you<br/>seem to only be restricting yourself to &quot;music making&quot;. Fine. I can&apos;t<br/>imagine how anything I&apos;ve said could be destructive to your efforts.</p><p>&gt; It did seem to me that talking about Skip behind his back regarding<br/>&gt; the quality of his Kithara was unacceptable.</p><p>I only addressed statements that he has made publically available,<br/>and I asked repeatedly to converse with him directly; as well, you<br/>never said &quot;Shut up unless he&apos;s here!&quot;. And I spoke about the kithara<br/>in passing, I believe, as part of the whole picture. As I wrote to L.<br/>Ayers on the list today, if somehow the focus on the kithara is out-<br/>of-whack, I accept fault for being unclear. But that doesn&apos;t change<br/>Skip&apos;s originally stated aesthetics behind building the instruments.</p><p>And as I said to her, I would like to have the chance to see and hear<br/>the kithara first hand, having only &apos;heard&apos; it on your recording.</p><p>And you brought up the kithara yourself, extolling it&apos;s virtues; if<br/>one can praise behind someone&apos;s back, may one not call into question<br/>potential problems?

I doubt he wants to belabor<br/>&gt; this stuff any more than I do.</p><p>I know, you would rather not address the issue. But I reiterate that<br/>if Skip and I could communicate directly it would, I know very well,<br/>smooth certain areas. We won&apos;t, and *shouldn&apos;t*, agree on everything.<br/>If you prefer to prevent us from speaking directly, so be it.</p><p>&gt; It is disappointing that insulting others is on the rise.</p><p>Johnny, I don&apos;t know what to say, but the volume of words and posts<br/>against my recent opinions have outweighed, in invective and raw<br/>statistics, any I originally wrote.</p><p>&gt; For what it&apos;s worth, the Barbican chose not to use the notes, or<br/>&gt; bios that I worked on and sent over.  They should have put the<br/>&gt; notes into the program which would have explained the improvisatory<br/>&gt; nature of &quot;Incident at Drakes Bay.&quot;</p><p>Yes, they should have. I imagine you didn&apos;t put up too much of a fuss<br/>about it, lest they not invite you back. But it is tricky dealing<br/>with concert promoters.</p><p>&gt; Partch is really only a small part of my life, but his<br/>&gt; dysfunctional extended family makes it very difficult to<br/>&gt; present.</p><p>Should I count that as an insult?</p><p>&gt; Clearly, people world over now have the opportunity to hear the<br/>&gt; original Partch on recordings, and Newband has been to both London<br/>&gt; and Bergen (evidently burning their bridges).</p><p>Is that an insult? Behind their backs?</p><p>&gt; Audiences have every opportunity to hear the originals.</p><p>And work must be done to get that happening more often. Which I will<br/>do. And I would urge people who want more Partch performances to<br/>contact Newband and Dean Drummond, to see if they will stage honest-<br/>to-goodness dramatic works with the original instruments. As is their<br/>responsibility.</p><p>&gt; If they like our work, they will reengage us.
