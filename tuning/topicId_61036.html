Although it would most likely be impossible to determine, when blues guitarists bend strings, where on the tuning continuum do they wind up? What ratios are they hitting most often? When I teach blues, string bending is often the most difficult subject for students to nail down. You cannot tell them how far to bend, as it has to be done by feel, they have to hear it, and teach the fingers how to find the proper pitch. And, even more importantly, a guitarist may bend a note differently every time he/she does it, depending on the feeling at the moment. And that&apos;s why blues is such a difficult form to master, each individual is a composer/arranger unto themselves, taking into account, of course, the basic underlying language of the genre. You can show people basic phrasing and such, but you can&apos;t tell them exactly when to play any particular riff...it&apos;s a hoot....best...HHH</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 11:11:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>These lines remind me a lot of the structure of Maqam Music, Neil.
