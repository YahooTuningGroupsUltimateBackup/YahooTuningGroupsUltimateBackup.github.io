What do you think of these ideas?</p><p>In the first edition I did mention the virtual pitch<br/>ideas (in the sense of briefly discussing and<br/>referencing them), but the new edition is more thorough --<br/>there are a couple of pages devoted to<br/>virtual pitch along with several sound examples.</p><p>Of course, as you move the partials around, you<br/>may (or may not) change the pitch of the sound.<br/>There are formulas that approximate the pitch shift<br/>to be expected (they involve the frequency change<br/>of a subset of the most prominant partials).<br/>My experience is that when you shift the partials<br/>only a little (as in the various n-tet optimized timbres<br/>or the bulk of the adaptively tuned examples)<br/>then the pitch shift is essentially undetectable.<br/>On the other hand, when you shift them a lot<br/>(for example, stretching by a factor like 2.1)<br/>then the effect becomes significant.<br/>There is an excellent study of the perception of<br/>pitch shift due to timbral change by Cohen<br/>(&quot;Effects of inharmonic partials on interval perception&quot;<br/>in Music Perception - spring 1984.)</p><p>&gt; Also Richard Parncutt has some code on the web that calculates<br/>&gt; dissonance by a different algorithm, I think.

For example, he tends to include the effects of<br/>masking in the roughness calculation (whereas I do not do so<br/>explicitely). I also do not explicitly account for the Fletcher-Munson<br/>loudness curves (though I have incoprporated this as a common<br/>preprocessing step). In any modelling endeavor there is always a<br/>trade-off between simplicity/clarity and ultimate accuracy. I suspect<br/>that in the normal range of usage our algorithms would give much the<br/>same results, though in extreme situations they might differ.</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=56652 href="#56652">ðŸ”—</a>jjensen142000 &#x3C;jjensen14@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2005 2:23:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Sethares&quot; &lt;sethares@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jeff wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/TTSS2.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/TTSS2.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; This link doesn&apos;t work<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Strange...
