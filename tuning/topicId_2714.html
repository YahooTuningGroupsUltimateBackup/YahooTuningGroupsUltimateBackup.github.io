I have, and the resulting ET was not E.</p><p>I&apos;ve tuned pianos, a clavichord, and a giant hammer dulcimer to a variety<br/>of tunings, including ET, using a variety of electronic timbres as the<br/>source.  Except for the dulcimer, the results were never very good.</p><p>In fact, my Peterson strobe tuner has an audio function, which will freeze<br/>the strobe like ice.  But tune a piano to stop the strobe and it beats with<br/>the sound, or tune a piano to the sound and the strobe moves.  I shudder to<br/>think of the results a monochord would produce!</p><p>&gt;no evidence that anyone knew the techniques that would make it was<br/>possible.  &gt;You cannot just &quot;feel&quot; your way to an acceptable ET on a strung<br/>keyboard, it &gt;has  to result from a system of cross measurements.</p><p>There&apos;s an interesting question: How accurately do piano tuners tune?  It&apos;s<br/>interesting because different measuring devices and even different human<br/>tuners will turn out different tunings.  They may all sound good, yet if<br/>you swap a few notes from one tuning into another, you get a bad tuning.<br/>It&apos;s a place I like to call timbre country... everybody&apos;s listening to<br/>something different.  Perhaps it&apos;s best just to say that they make<br/>adjustments as small as 0.1 cent.</p><p>What I find strange is that if they knew string lengths for ET, why not<br/>beat rates?</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=2730 href="#2730">ðŸ”—</a>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>5/7/1999 3:04:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/7/99 1:56:47 PM, <a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt;How accurately do piano tuners tune?

I tune pitch to within .5 cents, but unisons must<br/>be under .2(total) or they will be hard to keep consistant.  Often, unisons<br/>actually sound better when out by about .2 cents, (Weinriech effect), but it<br/>has to be very carefully done.<br/>   The modern, state of the art, tuning machines produce consistant tunings<br/>with a tolerance of .1 cent.  This is a negligible amount, so it is safe to<br/>say that two tuners with the right machines are going to be indistinguishable<br/> from one another to the vast majority of musicians.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div><h3><a id=2734 href="#2734">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/1999 5:24:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; In fact, my Peterson strobe tuner has an audio function, which will freeze<br/>&gt; the strobe like ice.</p><p> How much do those things cost anyway?</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
