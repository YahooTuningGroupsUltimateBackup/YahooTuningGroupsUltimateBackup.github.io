This CD<br/>is all electronic guitar/synth music, and concerns my feelings about<br/>Outer Space, and the potentials which may exist out there, somewhere. I<br/>have always been fascinated by science fiction books/films...Ray<br/>Bradbury&apos;s &quot;Martian Chronicles,&quot; Robert Heinlein, Frank Herbert, and<br/>George Adamski (anybody remember him? Pretty whacked); Forbidden Planet,<br/>2001, and many &quot;B&quot; movies of the 1950&apos;s and &apos;60&apos;s, plus great TV shows<br/>such as Outer Limits and Twilight Zone. These influenced me greatly as a<br/>kid, and stimulated my imagination in many ways...this music is my<br/>tribute to those early influences. This disc is much more concerned with<br/>images and landscapes then it is with &quot;playing&quot; the guitar, per se. I am<br/>well pleased with the way it turned out...for more info on my 1st 2<br/>CD&apos;s, please go to <a href="http://www.virtualchautauqua.org/haverstick">www.virtualchautauqua.org/haverstick</a>. My address is<br/>Box 150271 Lakewood Colo 80215..the discs go for $15, postage paid. (and<br/>this will be my last ad...just want to make sure the tuning folks know<br/>this is available). Thanks for all the support, I am...Hstick</p></div>
