So what, exactly, is left out of an &quot;N-(odd)-limit&quot; set<br/>&gt;that is included in a full Farey series?</p><p>Nothing. The N-(odd)-limit set has more ratios, since factors of 2 are<br/>&quot;free&quot;.</p><p>&gt;So... is the rule for finding the weighting as follows?  Divide the<br/>&gt;numerator and denominator, independently, by as many factors of 2 as<br/>&gt;possible, then take the larger number?</p><p>Yup, that&apos;s the &quot;odd limit&quot; of the ratio.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Qualitatively, this is an impressive validation of Partch&apos;s one-footed<br/>&gt;&gt;bride concept,</p><p>&gt;And what is that again?</p><p>Have you read Partch&apos;s book? Basically, he creates a graph of comparitive<br/>consonance, with ratios of 1 (defined by the same rule as the weighting rule<br/>you mention above) most consonant, ratios of 3 less consonant, ratios of 5<br/>less consonant than that, and so on through ratios of 7, 9, and 11, with<br/>ratios beyond the 11-limit being most dissonant. The increments between the<br/>consonance levels get smaller and smaller.</p><p>&gt;[Paul (&quot;Everyman&apos;s octave-equivalent harmonic entropy curve (for John deL<br/>.)&quot;:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I repeated the process for s=1.5% and N=67 (see<br/>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/o015_67.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/o015_67.jpg</a>). John<br/>&gt;&gt;deLaubenfels would like this curve since it repeats exactly at the<br/>&gt;&gt;octave (not shown) and the 9/7 is  more dissonant than the ET major<br/>&gt;&gt;second or tritone, while the 11/9 is less dissonant than the ET major<br/>&gt;&gt;second or tritone.</p><p>&gt;Yes, that DOES match better with what my ears would consider a good<br/>&gt;ranking.  How does it manage to get away with that, though, when 11/9<br/>&gt;is mathematically higher than 9/7?</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean &quot;mathematically higher&quot;. If you mean higher<br/>numbers are used in the ratio, well you can find examples of that in all the<br/>harmonic entropy graphs, but for smaller s you&apos;d generally need to use<br/>ratios with higher numbers than these -- for example 100/99 has a lower<br/>entropy than 12/11 for reasonable s values. In this case, the s=1.5%<br/>parameter means that 1/3 of the probability comes from more than 25 cents<br/>away from the actual interval. That means that the dips associated with each<br/>of the simple ratios are, in some sense, 50 cents across. So 11/9 is well<br/>within both the 5/4 dip and the 6/5 dip, which overlap, while 9/7 is on the<br/>very outer edge of the 5/4 dip and near no other dip. That&apos;s just my<br/>unscientific way of thinking about it, but seems to be the easiest way of<br/>seeing what&apos;s going on in these graphs, and fairly accurate too.</p></div>
