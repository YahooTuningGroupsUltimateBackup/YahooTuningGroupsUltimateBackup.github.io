But if you<br/>don&apos;t like it as a reference, what do you like? 5-limit just<br/>intonation? The results are very similar.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2008 8:51:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If we look at that 1776 &quot;Marpurg H&quot; layout (= &quot;Piagui II&quot;)<br/>melodically, we do get some distinguishable expressive features among<br/>the diatonic scales.</p><p>There are three differently-patterned major scales in it, and<br/>similarly three differently-patterned natural minor scales.  By cents:</p><p>Major: Do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do</p><p>1. 0, 198, 402, 498, 702, 900, 1098, 1200.</p><p>2. 0, 198, 396, 498, 696, 900, 1098, 1200.</p><p>3. 0, 204, 402, 504, 702, 900, 1104, 1200.</p><p>1 = C major, A major, F# major, Eb major. (Large Do-mi and small<br/>Sol-ti; small Mi-fa step and large Ti-do step)</p><p>2 = G major, E major, Db major, Bb major. (Small Do-mi and large<br/>Sol-ti; large Mi-fa step and large Ti-do step)</p><p>3 = D major, B major, Ab major, F major. (Large Do-mi *and* large<br/>Sol-ti; large Mi-fa step and small Ti-do step)</p><p>Natural minor: La-ti-do-re-mi-fa-sol-la</p><p>4. 0, 198, 300, 498, 702, 798, 1002, 1200.</p><p>5. 0, 198, 300, 498, 696, 798, 996, 1200.</p><p>6. 0, 204, 300, 504, 702, 804, 1002, 1200.</p><p>4 = A minor, F# minor, Eb minor, C minor. (Large Ti-do step and small<br/>Mi-fa step)</p><p>5 = E minor, C# minor, Bb minor, G minor. (Large Ti-do step and large<br/>Mi-fa step)</p><p>6 = B minor, G# minor, F minor, D minor. (Small Ti-do step and large<br/>Mi-fa step)</p><p>The other &quot;Piagui&quot; layouts rotate this around so different scales get<br/>these melodic characteristics.  Its minor 3rds are always 300 cents,<br/>of course.</p><p>If you&apos;re into temperaments like this that hack the Pythagorean comma<br/>into only four equal pieces, try Bendeler&apos;s third one from c1690 (and<br/>republished 1739).  It has the tempering of 1/4 PC each at C-G-D, E-B,<br/>and G#-D#.  Since those are distributed asymmetrically, there is a<br/>wider range of melodic differences than any of the &quot;Piagui&quot; variants<br/>have.<br/>- This Bendeler temperament ends up with two different sizes of major<br/>3rds: four of them are 392 (Bb-D, F-A, C-E, and G-B), and the other<br/>eight are 402.<br/>- There are three different sizes of minor 3rds: 306, 300, and 294.<br/>- There are three different sizes of whole steps: C-D at 192, five<br/>others at 204, and the remaining six at 198.<br/>- And there are three sizes of semitones: B-C at 108, five others at<br/>96, and the remaining six at 102.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
