However if we look at the three<br/>exceptions, we find that the interval from<br/>63/50 to 72/49, namely 400/343, is flat from 7/6 by a mere 2401/2400, and<br/>the same is true for the interval from<br/>49/36 to 100/63. The remaining interval, from 27/25 to 50/27, is sharp<br/>from 12/7 by an even more negligible 4375/4374.<br/>This JI scale is therefore barely, if at all, distinguishable from a<br/>circle of approximate subminor thirds--which is to say, an equal division<br/>of the octave into nine parts, where the only thing we allow as<br/>consonances are two or seven steps out of nine. Is this scale JI, JI<br/>tempered by 2401/2400 and 4375/4374 (ennealimmal temperament) or simply<br/>the 9-et?</p></div>
