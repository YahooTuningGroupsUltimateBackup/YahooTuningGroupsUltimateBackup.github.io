What we need is the title, the tuning, and separetly, one (short) line of presentation (for example for the MOTU&apos;s site if the demo is selected...), in any style you want. I&apos;m not sure if we need details like the instruments, but if the participants want to give them, or any further details, they are welcome and we can add those in a &quot;commentaries&quot; section, without obligation.<br/>For non-original tunings, please specify the source (ex. personnal tuning, Scala, author, etc.) and detail in full (in the form of the Scala file used it would be perfect) ; it can be joined to the commentaries section. But these details concern only the microtonal community.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, Jun 13, 2010 at 3:55 PM, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thank you so much Shaahin.
