If the music is to hold your attention, this may be a device to<br/>achieve maximum results.</p><p>A solo violinist is notorious for playing sharp to an orchestra in a<br/>concerto, most likely for reasons of definition, to distinguish the soloist<br/>from the ensemble.</p><p>Perfect Pitch and Absolute Pitch are synonymous for me, but they are<br/>different from the way it was described by Robert Walker.  It is not a<br/>learned attribute: it is something that you are born with (a gene) and it has<br/>its own advantages and disadvantages.  I do not have it, but if I teach a<br/>class in Ear Training or Theory, I make it my business to find out who does.<br/>In an average music class of 18 I would find only 1 or 2 with Perfect Pitch.<br/>They will learn everything differently.</p><p>There are other ways of retaining pitch....habit, emotional memory, matching<br/>a 60 cycle hum as a constant, the physical memory of one&apos;s idiosyncratic<br/>vocal range limit.  The Juilliard School insists its students bring a tuning<br/>fork at A=440 to be checked with each day of class, for memorization.  This<br/>does improve accuracy, but it&apos;s not the same thing as perceiving each pitch,<br/>with mathematical precision, unaided, and rather unstressed.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=20733 href="#20733">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2001 12:05:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Johnny,</p><p>I don&apos;t htink I&apos;d count as one of those 1 or 2!</p><p>In fact, don&apos;t have a good long term memory for pitch either,<br/>i.e. from one day to the next, though have a reasonably good<br/>short term memory, like over about an hour or so.</p><p>Though, when I was learning the &apos;cello, things were a bit<br/>different, and I could sometimes remember the A tuning fork<br/>pitch fairly accurately from one day to the next. So I think<br/>perhaps there is some element of training involved in it.<br/>(This is without particularly trying to remember it, just<br/>happens naturally).</p><p>I also remember once hearing some instrumentalists playing<br/>&quot;flat, but in tune&quot;, at that time, which was a very curious<br/>sensation, and so I don&apos;t think you need to have perfect<br/>pitch to hear that. (Not that it is a particularly desirable<br/>thing to hear but if anyone has hearing it as a goal, that<br/>gives them some encouragement!!)</p><p>However do find it much easier to percieve things in terms<br/>of absolute than relative pitch, and notice it most as<br/>a difficutly in perceiving relative pitch, combined with<br/>an ease in comparing pitches of notes, such as remembering<br/>the pitch of a partial, and then playing it. Also I<br/>can compare pitches of notes very easily just by hearing<br/>them in sequence one after another, to within a few cents<br/>and don&apos;t need to count beats for that. Also find it relatively<br/>easy to remember a pitch, and look out for its recurrence<br/>later on in a piece of music - to listen out for that pitch<br/>coming in again, in the same way that one might listen out for the<br/>entry of a particular instrument. All that comes in<br/>pretty useful when writing a music program, and debugging<br/>it!</p><p>Plus, a kind of &quot;pitch timbre&quot; effect that sounds a lot<br/>like instrument colour to me. It&apos;s quite vivid, but<br/>doesn&apos;t seem to assist in identifying the pitch from,<br/>say, one day to the next, though very helpful over<br/>shorter time periods.</p><p>I think there is quite a range and variety of ways of<br/>hearing sound, and perfect pitch is just one rather remarkable<br/>kind of way of hearing that a few have.</p><p>The distinction between absolute and relative pitch isn&apos;t<br/>my own invention, but found it in a helpful on-line article on the<br/>variety of ways pitch is perceived (can&apos;t remember the ref,<br/>but it is in one of the earlier posts). Synthesia (associating<br/>colours or other sensations with pitch) is yet another thing<br/>that is independent of the other two - there was an example<br/>of a pianist who had that, but associated the colour with<br/>the notes played, rather than the pitches, and so would perceive<br/>the same colours even if the pitch of the piano was changed.<br/>Perhaps my pitch timbre thing is a bit like that.</p><p>I don&apos;t know whether perfect pitch can be learnt, some people<br/>seemingly try to learn it. However, if one had it, I think one<br/>might still need to learn to identify pitches that one hears,<br/>in the same way that an artist could learn to identify and name<br/>various colours.</p><p>For instance, someone with perfect pitch in a 19-tet musical<br/>culture would presumably learn 19 main pitches instead of<br/>12.</p><p>I think one can also learn relative pitch, and am trying to learn<br/>it better myself. For instance, by playing easy tunes, then immediately<br/>transposing them up and down by a few semitones.</p><p>I&apos;ve got a lot to learn there - still working at the distinction<br/>between a minor third and a fourth, when played out of context<br/>at an arbitrary transposition, and if I&apos;m to identify it<br/>just by listening, and not trying to sing a scale from one<br/>to the other.</p><p>Though I can tell differences in relative pitches easily<br/>if there is enough context for them, say, in a musical phrase<br/>of half a dozen notes or so.</p><p>So when I say absolute pitch, I really mean in distinction to<br/>relative pitch, a tendency to focus on the absolute than the<br/>relative quality of the pitch of a note. Don&apos;t know if htere<br/>is a better word for that?</p><p>Perhaps a number of people may have absolute pitch in this<br/>more general sense, and not realise it, because it only<br/>really came to my attention as a result of trying out the<br/>new random chord quiz in the FTS 1.09 beta.</p><p>Focusing on absolute pitch instead of relative pitch can<br/>also make it hard for a beginner to match a heard pitch<br/>by singing it. They can hear it isn&apos;t the same as the one they<br/>are singing, but can&apos;t easily hear how far away it is,<br/>or even sometimes, which direction it is. I was a bit<br/>like that when younger, and still probably a bit slower<br/>than most at getting into the immediate vicinity of a heard<br/>note - once there, can get to the exact pitch quickly.</p><p>So, I wonder sometimes how many people who are actually<br/>quite musical may write themselves off as unmusical<br/>because they find it hard to match a heard pitch in this<br/>way?</p><p>I remember reading in the paper on Shephard tones, he needed<br/>to do some preliminary tests, and was surprised to find<br/>that some non musicians (scientist from the Bell laboratories<br/>in fact) were unable to distinguish<br/>notes a semitone apart at all - they are the ones<br/>who one could call tone deaf I suppose. Others though<br/>could tell such notes apart, but were unable to tell<br/>which way was up; which was higher. Later with<br/>time to sing and try it out, some of those then<br/>were able to get it.</p><p>I&apos;ve wondered if, just possibly, this might mean<br/>they are relying excessively on absolute rather than<br/>relative type pitch distinctions.</p><p>I know of scientists who are appreciative of music<br/>and sensitive to it, but think of themselves as<br/>un-musical, because they can&apos;t match a pitch<br/>in this way.</p><p>Just ideas.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=20734 href="#20734">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2001 12:07:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Haresh,</p><p>Yes, that may be it.

The pitch &quot;a&quot;<br/>starts as low as 373hz in Paris, 1648.</p><p>By 1789 &quot;a&quot; is up to 395 in Versailles... 415 in Dresden in 1754...</p><p>By 1780, concert &quot;a&quot; is 421.3 in the Vienna of Mozart&apos;s time (!!)</p><p>Well, the chart goes one... 423hz in Dresden 1815...436hz in London<br/>1878..</p><p>A440 doesn&apos;t appear until 1829 in Paris, the Paris Opera Orchestra..</p><p>Believe it or not, the &quot;American Pitch&quot; of Steinway in 1879 is<br/>reported as 457hz (!!) Ahem...</p><p>As to the reasons for all this, Ellis conjectures:</p><p>&quot;The rise in pitch began at the great Congress of Vienna, 1914, when<br/>the Emperor of Russia presented new and sharper windinstruments to an<br/>Austrian regiment of which he was colonel.  The band of this regiment<br/>became noted for the brilliancy of its tones.  In 1820 another<br/>Austrian regiment received even SHARPER instruments, and as the<br/>theatres were greatly dependent upon the bands of the home regiments,<br/>they were obliged to adopt their pitch.  Gradually, at Vienna, pitch<br/>rose from a&apos; 421.6 (Mozart&apos;s pitch) to a&apos; 456.1, that is, 136 cents,<br/>or nearly three-quarters of a Tone.  The mania spread throughout<br/>Europe, but at very different rates....&quot;</p><p>And in another statement (p. 513 of the paperback):</p><p>&quot;If we look into the secrets of the rise of pitch, we find it always<br/>connected with wind instruments...&quot;</p><p>So Ellis seems to pretty much blame wind players for this!!!</p><p>_______ ______ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=46223 href="#46223">ðŸ”—</a>Martin Braun &#x3C;nombraun@telia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2003 3:18:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl wrote:</p><p>&quot;Recent research does not suggest any genetic factor.

Interestingly, an anatomical<br/>deficit in APers could indeed be expected, based on the assumption<br/>hat the propensity to develop AP during childhood may be a by-effect<br/>of a harmless developmental disorder. Due to such a (slight)<br/>disorder, some children may have difficulties in doing the normal<br/>step from implicit AP at birth to implicit relative pitch (RP) when<br/>learning their first language. Implicit RP helps understanding the<br/>speech intonation of speakers other than the mother. So, while still<br/>struggling with acquiring implicit RP, these children may - if there<br/>is a musical environment - extend their implicit AP to explicit AP.<br/>From a neuroanatomical point of view, AP clearly is an easier task<br/>than RP. This is simply due to the tonotopic neural wiring throughout<br/>the auditory brain. For AP one only needs a certain memory<br/>connection. For RP, however, one needs a computation that compares<br/>pitch intervals across different spectral ranges, and thus across<br/>different neural map sections. Many have wondered why not all have<br/>explicit AP. The likely answer is that RP is of more use than AP in<br/>speech. A deficit in the right PT may impede the development of<br/>implicit RP, and then, by triggering a compensatory measure, lead to<br/>the development of explicit AP. &gt;&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t think that the comment about a possible relationship between<br/>relative pitch and the perception of pitch intonation of speakers<br/>other than one&apos;s mother is corroborated by anything that I am aware<br/>of concerning my early childhood (or later on, for that matter), so<br/>much of what I find in the above paragraph strikes me as a lot of<br/>nonsense.  I have never had any reason to believe that I might have<br/>any deficiency in my perception of relative pitch, and my microtonal<br/>experience (in which I often have not had the opportunity to commit<br/>certain pitches to memory) has shown me that I can easily identify<br/>subtle differences in intervals, being able to distinguish, for<br/>example, the difference between diatonic music played in 19-ET and 31-<br/>ET, as can most anyone with good relative pitch and sufficient<br/>listening experience.</p><p>However, I do happen to know that my speech development did not<br/>follow a normal pattern, because my mother mentioned it to me a<br/>couple of times some years later.  At an age many months past the<br/>time when I was expected to be speaking words, I was still spewing<br/>out &quot;gibberish&quot; (as she described it), complete with varying<br/>inflections of pitch, as if I were speaking a real language.  There<br/>was nothing wrong with my ability to hear and understand speech,<br/>because my parents tested me and found that I could point to objects<br/>whose word-names they spoke.  Our family physician advised them that<br/>I would most likely start speaking words once I was ready.  He was<br/>right, and once it happened, it was not just single words, but<br/>sentences.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=46235 href="#46235">ðŸ”—</a>Justin Weaver &#x3C;improvist@usa.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2003 1:45:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have heard of many people with similar experiences.
