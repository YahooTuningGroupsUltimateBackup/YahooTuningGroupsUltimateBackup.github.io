I&apos;ll try to be brief.</p><p>As you may have noticed, the sound used is not an ordinary square wave<br/>(though it sounds a lot like that) but actually a sine wave run through<br/>strong distortion. Because of the nature of &quot;phi&quot;, when you play two tones<br/>whose frequency ratio is equal to &quot;phi&quot;, then the difference tone is &quot;phi&quot;<br/>times lower than the lower of the two sounding tones. And this is what I was<br/>examining here most of all. But because some of the sounds in the Yamaha XG<br/>set are not perfectly &quot;in tune&quot;, it may happen occasionally that when you<br/>really DO play a tone &quot;phi&quot; times lower, it&apos;s a cent or two away from the<br/>difference tone of the upper two. And this is why you could hear some sort<br/>of beating in some parts of the recording. Also, one of the intervals in the<br/>used 12-tone scale is so close to 7/6 that I couldn&apos;t resist using this<br/>approximation extensively as well. Further more, I also found acceptable<br/>approximations to 21/16 and 13/9 there as well -- and that&apos;s why I used some<br/>&quot;weird interval combinations&quot; towards the end.</p><p>Okay, I think that&apos;s just about it. Let&apos;s see what I&apos;m going to do next<br/>time.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
