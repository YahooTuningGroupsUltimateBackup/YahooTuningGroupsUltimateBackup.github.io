It&apos;s all about using<br/>the sum and difference tones of all combinations of a collection of<br/>pitches, which can be seen as similar to Genus and CPS structures.<br/>Except that difference tone scales always deal with absolute pitches,<br/>that is they are not octave-repeating and must not be octave adjusted<br/>in any way.</p><p>The utonal series is especialy usable for this because while S/D tones<br/>(sum and difference tones) from any members of an overtone series<br/>simply are members of the same overtone series, undertones produce<br/>independent notes that lie outside of the original scale, but are<br/>related by simple just ratios. (Probably an interesting subject for<br/>lattices, which i am not concerned with myself).</p><p>I&apos;ve here calculated such a scale out of the first 8 undertones (using<br/>only the first 6 gives a fine result as well) of 4000 hz, which is an<br/>arbitrary choice. (I realize that there are better such for<br/>divisibility.) The &quot;generating frequencies&quot;, rounded of to integers are:</p><p>4000  2000  1333  1000  800  667  571  500</p><p>Thus the two dimensional matrix of difference tones for them becomes:</p><p> 0     2000  2666  3000  3200  3333  3428  3500<br/> 2000  0     666   1000  1200  1333  1428  1500<br/> 2666  666   0     333   533   666   761   833<br/> 3000  1000  333   0     200   333   428   500<br/> 3200  1200  533   200   0     133   228   300<br/> 3333  1333  666   333   133   0     95    166<br/> 3428  1428  761   428   228   95    0     71<br/> 3500  1500  833   500   300   166   71    0</p><p>And for sums:</p><p> 8000  6000  5333  5000  4800  4666  4571  4500<br/> 6000  4000  3333  3000  2800  2666  2571  2500<br/> 5333  3333  2666  2333  2133  2000  1904  1833<br/> 5000  3000  2333  2000  1800  1666  1571  1500<br/> 4800  2800  2133  1800  1600  1466  1371  1300<br/> 4666  2666  2000  1666  1466  1333  1238  1166<br/> 4571  2571  1904  1571  1371  1238  1142  1071<br/> 4500  2500  1833  1500  1300  1166  1071  1000</p><p>Note that after having decided the generating frequency list, there<br/>are NO divisions or multiplications involved.
