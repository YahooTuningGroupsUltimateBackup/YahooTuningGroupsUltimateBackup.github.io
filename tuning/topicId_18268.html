If you were to stay on Yahoo, you<br/>&gt;have given your implicit permission to the Terms of Service license<br/>&gt;agreement.  They assume people have read it.  However, clearing the<br/>&gt;&quot;original sequence&quot; with the maker of the sequence is another matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would presume, if you were to contact this person, he would be<br/>&gt;DELIGHTED that his work is available in various tuning forms on the<br/>&gt;Internet.  But then, I can&apos;t really speak for somebody else...</p><p>Quite right, Joe.  And in point of fact I have a fistful of e-mails<br/>from people giving me permission to tune and post the tunings of their<br/>sequences.  In a few cases, where the sequence has no attribution and<br/>the place I got it has only a stale e-mail address (the Caravan sequence<br/>is the only one I can think of), I have gone ahead and posted the<br/>sequence without explicit permission.</p><p>Yahoo may or may not be trustworthy.
