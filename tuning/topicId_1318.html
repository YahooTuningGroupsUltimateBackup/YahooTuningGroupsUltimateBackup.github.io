Or a 3/2 spiked with<br/>5ness.  The 9/4 sounds like a 3/2 opened with 3ness.  This whole deal seems<br/>work best when there&apos;s a base 2 in the denominator.</p><p>For other types of ratios, the highest prime seems to dominate the<br/>character, especially when it is on top; the 6/5 is difficult, but sounds<br/>mildly 5-like to me.  The 5/3 much more clearly 5ish.  The 7/6 and 7/5 both<br/>sound distinctly 7-like, the 12/7 and 10/7 less so.  The 14/9 sounds more<br/>7ish than 9 or 3ish to me, and the 9/7 is a tough one, but I think is<br/>closer to 7 than 9 or 3.</p><p>11 sounds tropical-like, but only with a base 2 under can I hear it at all.<br/> I should mention that with this stuff, I&apos;ve not been tested.  I&apos;ve been<br/>looking right at it and asking myself for a subjective description.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=1326 href="#1326">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/6/1999 2:57:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Lumma:]<br/>&gt; 3=openess<br/>&gt; 5=sweetness<br/>&gt; 7=florescent lightingness<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and 15/8 to sound remarkably like its prime<br/>&gt; factorization would suggest</p><p>[Erlich:]<br/>&gt; how would that differ from what 6/5&apos;s prime<br/>&gt; factorization would suggest?</p><p>[Lumma:]<br/>&gt; It seems to sound like a 5/4 diluted by 3-ness.<br/>&gt; Or a 3/2 spiked with 5ness.
