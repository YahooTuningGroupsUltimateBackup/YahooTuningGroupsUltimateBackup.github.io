I have also begun writing tuning software that has<br/>&gt;access to a completed .midi file, and thus can look forward in time,<br/>&gt;something real-time software can&apos;t do.</p><p>Super!</p><p>&gt;Chords such as full diminished 7ths and augmented triads, creatures of<br/>equal &gt;temperament, my software simply leaves tuned in equal temperament.</p><p>Have you considered 10-12-14-17 (or, in some cases, 9-11-13-15) for the<br/>diminished 7th?</p><p>The augmented triad can be more tricky.  Here&apos;s a list of possibilities,<br/>all of them smoother than 3tET to my ear...</p><p>1)The &quot;literal&quot; translation, 1/1-5/4-25/16, pretty tense<br/>2)&quot;Classical&quot; version, 1/1-5/4-8/5, very similar to #1<br/>3)1/1-5/4-19/12, still spacy enough for most applications<br/>4)8-10-13, too smooth for many applications</p><p>&gt;Other problem chords, such as those with four or more notes forming<br/>&gt;consecutive fifths, may also be tuned in 12-tone, in which fifths aren&apos;t<br/>too &gt;bad, and thirds are at least preferable to those generated in 3-limit<br/>&gt;tuning!</p><p>True, but do the 3rds matter as much as the 5ths?</p><p>Carl</p></div>
