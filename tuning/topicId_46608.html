Does it mean &quot;highly<br/>positive&quot;? The conclusion of the review is as follows:</p><p>&quot;Overall, this volume is a success; its principal strength lies in<br/>the bringing together of many, and many-voiced, disciplines. Several<br/>chapters, particularly those by Brown, Merker, Dissanayake and<br/>Freeman, constitute engaging and prospectively fertile contributions<br/>to the debate on music and its origins, while many others provide<br/>extremely helpful overviews of diverse fields. The only caveats that<br/>I would express are concerned with the volume&apos;s generally uncritical<br/>acceptance of music as having adaptive value, and with its<br/>over-selective account of the archaeology of music. But this is an<br/>extraordinarily broad field and one that is itself in a constant<br/>state of evolution: like any scientific area, the consensus is<br/>susceptible to overthrow by emerging data or interpretation of<br/>existing data; like any field of social debate whose terms and<br/>arguments are shaped by the cultural context in which they arise,<br/>those terms and arguments are susceptible to change as the cultural<br/>framework changes. This book is a significant achievement; the<br/>editors have produced a volume that, at its least convincing,<br/>provokes the need for explicit and coherent counter-argument, and at<br/>its best serves to illuminate previously unrevealed facets of music<br/>and of musical experience.&quot;</p><p>Martin</p></div><h3>Justin Weaver &#x3C;improvist@usa.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2003 10:20:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Evolutionary biomusicology seems to me to be an attempt to apply Chomskian =</p><p>linguistics to music-- and neither Chomsky&apos;s linguistics nor any propsed mu=<br/>sical<br/>application has any real basis in neurological reality.

Of<br/>course, we are not hardwired for the latter. But, for example, we are<br/>hardwired to perceive sound spectra with the typical harmonicity of<br/>the human voice as more pleasant than most other natural sound<br/>spectra. Part of this hardwiring is the pitch mechanism in the<br/>auditory brain stem, which according to present evidence is biased<br/>towards low-order ratios up to 6:5 in the interval range between<br/>about 260 and 520 Cent.</p><p>Details are on my website and elsewhere on the web.</p><p>Martin</p></div>
