But as the incorrect Fifth a1 lies among<br/>the deep combinational tones and is very weak, the difference is<br/>scarcely perceptible. Moreover, practically almost impossible to tune<br/>the interval so precisely as to insure the combinational tone a1 in<br/>place of a.&quot;<br/>&#x9;(in Dover edition, translated by Ellis, it&apos;s p. 335)<br/>For Helmholtz, a1 is one comma (81/80) below a. If he hear an a, it<br/>involve that the Fourth a - d is 4/3. Mathematically, the only solution<br/>is with 19/16 for the Third d - f. But, he didn&apos;t written this fraction.</p><p>Paul H.

Lattard is<br/>saying that in 1/4-comma meantone, the minor thirds are about 5 cents flat<br/>of 6:5; this is close enough to 6:5 to sound pretty good, as a 6:5, and not<br/>as a 19:16, which is 19 cents flat of 6:5.</p></div><h3><a id=5111 href="#5111">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

In 2/7-comma meantone (advocated by Zarlino), the minor third and<br/>major third are both 1/7-comma flat. By far the main reason 1/4-comma was<br/>more popular than these in the Renaissance and early Baroque was the fact<br/>that the fifth is tempered less in 1/4-comma (in fact, the name of the<br/>temperament refers to how much the fifth is tempered). I would definitely<br/>favor 10:12:15 minor chords for music from this time period, since at points<br/>of rest the major chord was substituted anyway (via the Picardy third).</p></div>
