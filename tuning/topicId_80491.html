The origins of these three elements are explained in my book.</p><p>If we call M and J to the corresponding Schisma and comma that operate in the six</p><p>narrow fifths detailed below, they have the following values:</p><p>M = (32805/32768) = 1.00112915039 =  1.95372 cents = Schisma.</p><p>J = [(33554432 x 2^1/4)/39858075] = 1.0011313711 = 1.957561 cents =</p><p>Consonant comma.</p><p>The new scale tone frequencies follows:</p><p>C    =  1........... =  0 Cents</p><p>C#  =  1.05826893294 .. =  98.04756.. =  About  -2 cents from ETT.</p><p>D    =  1.12246370821.. =  200.00256    =  About 0 cents from ETT.</p><p>Eb   =  1.18786320091.. =  298.04243.. =  About -2 cents from ETT.</p><p>E    =  1.25991918672 .. =  399.997439  =  About 0 cents from ETT.</p><p>F     =  1.33333333333.. =  498.045       =  About -2 cents from ETT.</p><p>F#  =  1.41421356237.. =  600......=  0 cents from ETT.</p><p>G    =  1.5 ......... =  701.955... =  About +2 cents from ETT.</p><p>Ab   =  1.58740339942.. =  800.00256    =  About 0 cents from ETT.</p><p>A    =  1.68369556231.. =  901.95756.. =  About +2 cents from ETT.</p><p>Bb   =  1.78179480135... =  999.99743    =  About 0 cents from ETT.</p><p>B    =  1.88987878008.. =  1101.95244  =  About +2 cents from ETT.</p><p>2C   =  2........... =  1200..... =  0 cents from ETT.</p><p>It is remarkable that the twelve tone relative frequencies comply with</p><p>the following ratios:</p><p>(D/C#) = (E/Eb) = (F#/F) = (G/F#) = (A/Ab) = (B/Bb) = (9/8)^(1/2)</p><p>C# =(Eb/D)=(F/E)=(Ab/G)=(Bb/A)=(2C/B)=[(9/8)^(1/2)]/[(Schisma)^2]</p><p>All twelve tone scales operate with narrow fifths and the Pythagorean comma which are</p><p>given by common numbers or cents.</p><p>The eight schismas scale presents interesting features which might be signs</p><p>of the searched scale. The scale works with six narrow fifths; each one is</p><p>obviously complemented by a factor to give 1.5. One of its interesting features</p><p>concerns to the six complementary factors which are not common numbers;</p><p>instead, the square of M and the square of J factors produce the Pythagorean</p><p>comma:</p><p>(M^2)(M^2)(M^2)(M^2)(J^2)(J^2) = (M^8)(J^4) = Pythagorean comma =</p><p>1.013643264.....</p><p>The first six lines of the following tabulation correspond to the six narrow fifths.</p><p>We can see that they are distanced from 1.5 by M^2 or by J^2.</p><p>(2D/G)   = 1.496618277 and (1.5/1.496618277)=1.002259575= M^2.</p><p>(2E/A)   = 1.496611638 and (1.5/1.496611638)=1,002264022= J^2.</p><p>(2F#/B) = 1.496618277 and (1.5/1.496618277)=1.002259575= M^2.</p><p>(2C#/F#)=1.496618277 and (1.5/1.496618277)=1.002259575= M^2.</p><p>(2Eb/Ab)= 1.496611638 and (1.5/1.496611638)=1,002264022= J^2.</p><p>(2F/Bb) = 1.496618277 and (1.5/1.496618277)=1.002259575= M^2.</p><p>(G/C)     = 1.5  Pure fifth</p><p>(A/D)     = 1.5   Pure fifth</p><p>(B/E)     = 1.5   Pure fifth</p><p>(Ab/C#) = 1.5   Pure fifth</p><p>(Bb/Eb) = 1.5   Pure fifth</p><p>(2C/F)    = 1.5   Pure fifth</p><p>For the first time, all narrow fifths are distanced from 1.5 by the</p><p>squared schisma (M^2) and by the comma (J^2) which</p><p>are musical parameters.
