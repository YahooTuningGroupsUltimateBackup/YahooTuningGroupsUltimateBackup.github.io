Almost all of my<br/>&gt; study of trivalent scales involves pairwise well-formedness (which<br/>&gt; entails trivalence). All pairwise well-formed scales have odd<br/>&gt; cardinality, and there are pairwise well-formed scales for all odd<br/>&gt; numbers greater than or equal to 3.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll try to think about the even cases.</p><p>Thanks, look forward to hearing what you come up with,<br/>if anything of course, that being the way of conjectures.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
