Here is description:</p><p>This work was created as completely free improvisation in real time, recorded from zero into MIDI sequencer, without any post recording editing.

Listener can hear this process, can get used to more dense tone terrain, so this work can serve as a training for listeners of microtonal works. :-) All those tunings start from C.</p><p>Because of limitation in microtones in XG standard (which allows only -64/+63 C detuning) it was necessary to use more MIDI channels for tunings with more tones in octave than 12. I could play always only one of these subsets in real time on the MIDI keyboard, not all tones were to disposal, but this was no problem with selected method of total improvisation. Of course I could hear previously recorded tracks and react and interact to them. It was even certain advantage, as keyboard could be played in a usual way, and I could create some characteristic motifs in the frame of subsets. To enable this I distributed tones among more MIDI channels as equally as possible to get as much tones of scale on every used MIDI channel. For example in 17 ET has each subset 9 tones, differently tuned, and tone C without detuning is on both channels.<br/>Using more MIDI channels with same sounds just for getting more tones in octave limited possible number of layers.</p><p>Study 1 - slendro tuning inspired me to play quasi-gamelan music, with respective sounds: bonang, gender, gamelan, gamelimba and atarigane (that one is Japanese, sorry)</p><p>Study 2 - flute sounds - Pan Flutes, bottle, shakuhachi and kawala.</p><p>Study 3 - with percussive/plucked character thanks to cimbalon, santur and rebab.
