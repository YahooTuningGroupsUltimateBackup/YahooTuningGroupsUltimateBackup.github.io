He received his musical training from his own<br/>father. Although not formally trained he didn&apos;t restrict his<br/>repertoire to polkas, tangos, mazurkas and Finnish folk music. I<br/>remember him playing pieces of Johann Sebastian Bach and other<br/>composers as well.<br/>So it is only natural that I was interested in music from very early<br/>age. My father was quite disappointed when I showed no interest on<br/>the accordeon. I was instead drawn to the world of synthesizers! My<br/>father can only blame Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and Commodore 64.<br/>Finally he bought a Yamaha SY35 synthesizer to me and my twin<br/>brother. We had a lot of use for it in our teenage bands. Much later<br/>I got a second hand E-mu Emax Sampler with which I did my first<br/>microtonal experiments back in 1998. It was quite troublesome since<br/>there is no tuning table in EMAX. Later I have figured out that the<br/>scale which I tuned into it is called Harmonic Octatonic scale. Back<br/>then I didn&apos;t find the sound of it interesting and I forgot the whole<br/>subject of tuning for a while.<br/>Recently I purchased a PC with a decent soundcard and started to mess<br/>up with the soundfonts. I instantly found a way to tune my samples<br/>into any scale I could imagine. My imagination was quickly exhausted<br/>on inventing scales and soon I turned on the Internet for more<br/>information and there I found YOU GUYS.<br/>I want to thank especially you, Joe Monzo. Your index for tuning<br/>terms has been an extremely valuable source of information. I have<br/>spent almost all of my summer holiday in this fascinating subject<br/>playing in different equal temperaments, pythagorean tuning, tonality<br/>diamonds and combination product sets. For providing information on<br/>the thoughts of Erv Wilson I want to thank Kraig Grady.<br/>Also helpful have been the writings of the Ivor Darreg maintained by<br/>Brian McLaren and the writings of Margo Schulter and Paul Ehrlich.<br/>The Scala software by Manuel Op de Coul has been most helpful.<br/>I could never have learned so much in such a short time without the<br/>help of the microtonal community. Thank you all!<br/>Now I would like to ask about a practical problem. Since I am a poor<br/>student I couldn&apos;t possibly buy any microtonal controller so I have<br/>to cope with the standard Halberstadt keyboard. Because scales<br/>commonly have more than 12 pitches I have to map them across the<br/>keyboard. I assume there is no general way to cope with this problem<br/>but I would like to know how keyboardists of you handle this. For<br/>eikosanies for example I have used the keys C C# D D# F F# G G# A A#<br/>in two octaves. That is the best solution I have found for them since<br/>the black keys work as visual cues. I fear that some great scales<br/>like many of the equal temperaments may become unattractive to me<br/>just because of the mapping problem. So if you know some good ways to<br/>cope with it let me know!</p><p>best wishes,</p><p>Kalle Aho.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 12:04:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., kalleaho@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; I fear that some great scales<br/>&gt; like many of the equal temperaments may become unattractive to me<br/>&gt; just because of the mapping problem.

Personally,<br/>the mapping problem does bother me more than it does some other<br/>people (such as Joseph Pehrson and Brian McLaren). I&apos;m assuming<br/>you&apos;re familiar with my solution for 22-tET, which omits the &quot;E&quot; keys<br/>on the keyboard, thus placing the &quot;naturals&quot; of my decatonic system<br/>on the black keys, with the white keys acting as &quot;sharps&quot;<br/>and &quot;flats&quot; . . . yes?</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2001 12:56:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Dan,</p><p>And, of course, now you&apos;ve got all of us  -- who not only love you<br/>for your words but your music as well -- wanting to hear</p><p>    &quot;a series of microtonal pieces for two pianos, the Sovittaja Park<br/>    preludes, that were 100% influenced the place and my time spent<br/>    there on Damond pond.&quot;</p><p>And I just have to think that Prent Rodgers could come up with a<br/>great piece inspired by the Finnish accordian cutting contests.</p><p>But I&apos;ve been wrong before! :)</p><p>Thanks, as usual, for the fine verbiage, and for sharing part of your<br/>life...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>jon wild &#x3C;wild@fas.harvard.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/31/2001 8:13:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi to Kalle - I spent a terrific month in Finland in 1998, mostly for a<br/>summer workshop on music cognition held in Jyvaskyla, but I enjoyed<br/>Helsinki for a week too.

We study these matters quite a<br/>bit on &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This far I myself have been interested in both the temperaments and<br/>&gt; just intonation.</p><p>Hopefully, by &quot;temperaments&quot; you don&apos;t just mean equal temperaments.</p><p>&gt; Personally I find it wise to tune scales derived<br/>&gt; from Combination Product Sets or Tonality Diamonds in Just<br/>Intonation<br/>&gt; since it is not particularly important to be able to modulate in<br/>&gt; these systems.</p><p>That makes absolutely perfect sense. However, many composers who have<br/>used these JI structures, such as Harry Partch and Kraig Grady, have<br/>embedded them in larger JI scales which &quot;fill the holes&quot; in a way<br/>that allows for many more consonant relationships, as well as a sort<br/>of full melodic flexibility. These scales generally conform to<br/>Fokker&apos;s conception of &quot;periodicity blocks&quot; in the lattice. Dave<br/>Keenan has shown convincingly that certain very fine temperings (NOT<br/>ETs -- think meantone as a simple example) of these larger JI scales<br/>can _greatly_ increase the number of consonant relationships, while<br/>(to our ears) not materially decreasing the consonance of each of<br/>these intervals. The details, and general principles, of all this are<br/>being discussed mainly on &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning-math@yahoogroups.com">tuning-math@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, but much is<br/>to be found in the archives of this list. Dave Keenan has also<br/>constructed &quot;microtemperaments&quot; for JI scales that are not<br/>periodicity blocks, for example Dean Drummond&apos;s &quot;zoomoozophone&quot; scale.</p><p>&gt; Strictly pure intervals give these scales an eerie<br/>&gt; edge. I don&apos;t find justly tuned intervals boring at all as some<br/>&gt; people do.</p><p>I would at least try out some of Dave Keenan&apos;s microtemperaments, to<br/>see if the quality of the slightly-tempered intervals is<br/>aesthetically useful to you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am also interested in synthetic scales (which do not have any<br/>&gt; prototypes in Just Intonation) because I&apos;m a fan of Olivier<br/>Messiaen<br/>&gt; and Iannis Xenakis.</p><p>You might be surprised how synthetic scales can often be related to<br/>just intonation scales with certain &quot;commas&quot; tempered out . . .</p></div>
