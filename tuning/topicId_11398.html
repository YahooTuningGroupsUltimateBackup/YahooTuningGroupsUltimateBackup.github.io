The JI chords were 4:5:6:7, 5:6:7:9, and<br/>1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4, and the others were the nearest approximations to those in<br/>22-tET and 12-tET.</p><p>&gt;They are fascinating .mp3s, since they differ so markedly from one to<br/>&gt;another.  I&apos;m not certain how Paul was able to do this, or what<br/>&gt;equipment he was using (he will probably explain subsequently), but it<br/>&gt;certainly does work.</p><p>As I pointed out, the reason you may not have noticed much difference with<br/>your timbres is because they only contained partials 1 2 4 8 and 16, so had<br/>no opportunities for first-order beating to arise. My timbres have all<br/>partials, so lots of beating is there. In particular, I used a<br/>rectified-sine waveform for each tone, created .wav files in Matlab, and<br/>converted the .wavs to .mp3s using CoolEdit. I also kept the average (log)<br/>pitch of each chord constant, so that one wouldn&apos;t have to worry about<br/>whether a net pitch shift up or down would impact the comparison.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

And with pure sine waves,<br/>or a timbre like the one you used with only octave partials, you might not<br/>have heard any difference at all, especially in the utonal chords (in the<br/>otonal chords difference tones can help you out even with sine waves).</p></div><h3>Paul H.

For a<br/>waveform which follows the sine curve from peak to crest, but then<br/>immediately jumps up to the peak again, I find the following relative<br/>amplitudes:</p><p>Fundamental -- 1<br/>2nd partial -- 2/5<br/>3rd partial -- 9/35<br/>4th partial -- 4/21<br/>5th partial -- 5/33<br/>6th partial -- 18/143<br/>7th partial -- 7/65<br/>8th partial -- 8/85<br/>9th partial -- 27/323<br/>10th partial -- 10/133<br/>nth partial -- 3n/((2n-1)(2n+1))</p><p>That sounds really buzzy, like a sawtooth wave. So I decided to keep<br/>investigating. For a waveform which follows the sine curve from 45 degrees<br/>to 315 degrees, but then immediately jumps up to 45 degrees again, I find<br/>the following relative amplitudes:</p><p>Fundamental -- 1<br/>2nd partial -- 14/55<br/>3rd partial -- 7/45<br/>4th partial -- 28/247<br/>5th partial -- 35/391<br/>6th partial -- 2/27<br/>7th partial -- 49/775<br/>8th partial -- 8/145<br/>9th partial -- 7/143<br/>10th partial -- 70/1591<br/>nth partial -- 7n/((4n-3)(4n+3))</p><p>For a waveform which follows the sine curve from 30 degrees to 330 degrees,<br/>but then immediately jumps up to 30 degrees again, I find the following<br/>relative amplitudes:</p><p>Fundamental -- 1<br/>2nd partial -- 22/119<br/>3rd partial -- 33/299<br/>4th partial -- 44/551<br/>5th partial -- 11/175<br/>6th partial -- 66/1271<br/>7th partial -- 77/1739<br/>8th partial -- 88/2279<br/>9th partial -- 99/2891<br/>10th partial -- 2/65<br/>nth partial -- 11n/((6n-5)(6n+5))</p><p>This one still has the &quot;buzz&quot;, just a little attenuated. So it seems that<br/>the buzz is associated with the amplitudes going as 1/n for high enough<br/>partials. I think I&apos;ll continue using the rectified sine wave, then, unless<br/>anyone has any other suggestions.</p><p>P.S.<br/>In general, if the waveform follows the sine curve from 180/x degrees to<br/>360-(180/x) degrees, the relative amplitude of the nth partial will be</p><p>(2x-1)n/((xn-(x-1))(xn+(x-1)))</p><p>(does someone care to prove this using calculus?)</p><p>If x gets really close to 1 (say 1+d, where d approaches zero), you<br/>essentially have a sawtooth wave, and taking the limit, you get n/n^2 = 1/n,<br/>as you would expect. If x gets really large, you essentially have a sine<br/>wave, and taking the limit, you get 1 for n=1, and 0 for n&gt;1, again as you<br/>would expect.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2000 9:06:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
