        <a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>31</h1><h3><a id=29201 href="#29201">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/16/2001 2:44:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By adding a relative 7-goodness measure for the n-et to the same for<br/>the m-et, where n+m=31, I got the following ordering of white-keys,<br/>black-keys, which is probably as good a one as any to consider them<br/>in: 27+4, 19+12, 22+9, 16+15, 26+5, 21+10, 29+2, 25+6, 24+7, 18+13,<br/>30+1, 28+3, 17+14, 20+11, 23+8.</p><p>27+4</p><p>From the continued fraction for 4/27 we get 1/7 as an approximation,<br/>and 1/4 &lt; 8/31 &lt; 7/27 locates our generator. It is a *flat* minor<br/>third, though a bit better than that of the 12-et as we can see from<br/>the above inequalities, so this is not the same system as the 8/19<br/>system, but is closely allied to 7/27 and 15/58. If 5/19 and 9/34 are<br/>called kleismic then this one shouldn&apos;t be; in any case the kleisma<br/>isn&apos;t very relevant. We have the following table:</p><p>3  10 10<br/>5  9  10<br/>7  7  10</p><p>The first column gives the prime, the second the generator steps to<br/>reach it, and the third the p-complexity, which can be seen from the<br/>generator steps and is in this case 10 in all three limits--as could<br/>have been predicted from the way I sorted these, this is a good<br/>system for the 7-limit. We have a 7-note scale with pattern 1717177,<br/>an 11-note scale with pattern 11611611616 and a 15-note scale with<br/>pattern 111511151115115. While we have a complexity of 10, this does<br/>not mean the 7-note scale lacks for harmonic resources; from<br/>10-9=1 we get many major sixths and minor thirds, from 10-7 = 3 many<br/>septimal major sixths and minor thirds, and from 9-7=2 septimal<br/>tritones. The significant commas for this system are the small<br/>septimal comma of 126/125, the breedsma of 2401/2400, and their ratio<br/>(126/125)/(2401/2400) = 1728/1715, which doesn&apos;t seem to have<br/>acquired a name.</p><p>19+12</p><p>This is, of course, 1/4.15-comma meantone, and 7, 12 or 19 meantone<br/>fifths will give what can be considered scales or temperaments, as<br/>you choose. While the tendency to think this is the only way to<br/>arrange the notes of the 31-et should be resisted, it is both obvious<br/>and excellent for 5-limit harmony, and does well beyond it. From<br/>Euclid we get the approximation 5/8 for 12/19, and locate the<br/>meantone fourth by 5/12 &lt; 13/31 &lt; 8/19. If we look at the Farey<br/>sequence in this neighborhood, up to denominators of 75, we get<br/>5/12&lt;28/67&lt;23/55&lt;18/43&lt;31/74&lt;13/31&lt;<br/>21/50&lt;29/69&lt;8/19&lt;27/64&lt;19/45&lt;30/71&lt;11/26,<br/>which pretty well defines the range of the meantone (if we go lower<br/>we get schismic instead, and 30/71 already has better fifths and<br/>thirds than the meantone is giving it.) While it hardly seems<br/>necessary to point it out, the diatonic scale with pattern 5535553<br/>and the 12-meantone temperament of 332323323232 fall out by the usual<br/>methods. With a 3-complexity of 1, 5 of 4, 7 of 10 and 9 of 10, this<br/>is an excellent system and deservedly popular.</p><p>22+9</p><p>After approximating 22/9 by 5/2, we locate the generator by<br/>2/9 &lt; 7/31 &lt; 5/22. If we look at the Farey sequence up to 90 from<br/>7/31 to 5/22, we see that this defines a certain family:<br/>7/31&lt;19/84&lt;12/53&lt;17/75&lt;5/22, whose generator is a sharp septimal<br/>minor third (7/6); if no one has yet named it I propose the George<br/>Orwell, because of the 19/84 generator. We get the following<br/>orwellian values for generator steps:</p><p>3:7   5:-3   7:8   11:2</p><p>This gives a 5-complexity of 10, 7 of 11, 9 of 17 and 11 of 17; the<br/>31-et also has 13 and 17 of 17. The system abounds in intervals of<br/>12/7 and 7/6 (of course), as well as 11/8, 5/4, 11/5 and 11/6. The<br/>9-note scale has pattern 434343433, and we also have a 13-note scale<br/>of pattern 1331331331333.</p><p>16+15</p><p>16/15 is of course approximately 1/1, and 1/16 &lt; 2/31 &lt; 1/15 defines<br/>the location of this generator. It belongs to a small family,<br/>2/31 &lt; 5/77 &lt; 3/46, which all have 3: 9, 5: 5, 7: -3, and 11: 7 as<br/>the number of generator steps to reach the 11-limit. This gives<br/>complexities of 9 for 3, 9 for 5, 12 for 7, and 21 for 9 and 11.<br/>Characteristic intervals are 11/5, 11/6 and 5/3. The 15 and 16 note<br/>scales are of course respectively 2x14 3, and 2x15 1.</p><p>26+5</p><p>The good times just keep rolling with the 31-et; 26/5 is of course<br/>approximated by 5, and we have 5/26 &lt; 6/31 &lt; 1/5, as well as another<br/>small family, 5/26 &lt; 11/57 &lt; 6/31, all of which have<br/>3:3 5:12 7:-1 11:-8 13:14 for generator steps. This system features a<br/>generator of 8/7, which is too nearly exact in the 26-et to give a<br/>very good value for the fifth. Characteristic intervals are 7/4 (of<br/>course), 3/2, 7/6, 9/7, 9/5, 13/10 and 11/7. We have a 5-note scale,<br/>66667, and an 11-note scale, 51515151511.</p><p>21+10</p><p>This is the first glimmer of the miracle system, unless you want to<br/>count the 10-et. From 21/10 we get 2/1, and hence 2/21 &lt; 3/31 &lt; 1/10.<br/>If we look at the Farey sequence for denominators less than 100 after<br/>3/31, we get 3/31 &lt; 7/72 &lt; 4/41, and this defines the miracle family.<br/>The 10-note scale with pattern 3333333334 is the most obvious choice,<br/>but there&apos;s also 11 notes and 33333333331. Characteristic intervals<br/>are 7/4, 3/2, 5/4, 7/5, 11/9 and 11/6.</p></div>
