Why not ask for examples in the threads instead of here where we don&apos;t know what you&apos;re referring to?</p><p>&gt;   Note: I am assuming 5-limit JI qualifies as historic, since it<br/>&gt; apparently is used in a fashion similar to much older diatonic<br/>&gt; mean-tone tunings.</p><p>5-limit JI, at least as a theory, is much older than meantone.  The reality is something historians can debate but I still think JI is older.</p><p>&gt;     Case in point: 5-limit vs. 7-limit JI (with 7-limit JI being the<br/>&gt; &quot;yet to be widely adopted&quot; successor).<br/>&gt;   They have different chords and few intervals with the exact same<br/>&gt; musical meaning as each other...but can both generate the same range<br/>&gt; of emotions with near-equal ease (and isn&apos;t that the ultimate goal of<br/>&gt; music anyhow?).  Case of what?  Of one contributor making a large number of posts the rest of us disagree with, and that you haven&apos;t got round to ignoring yet?</p><p>&gt;    Another case: JI vs. Wilson&apos;s MOS scales.  Case of what?</p><p>&gt;    Yet another: the circle of thirds (NOT circles of 5ths) in 10TET,<br/>&gt; for example at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/circleofthirds.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/circleofthirds.html</a>.</p><p>What of it?</p><p>&gt;    Yet another: Fundamentally different PHI-based tunings based on the<br/>&gt; noble mediant IE Noble_Mediant(i/j, m/n) = (i + Phi * m) / (j + Phi *<br/>&gt; n) vs. PHI tunings based on mean-tone IE taking powers of PHI and<br/>&gt; dividing by powers of 2.  What of them?</p><p>&gt;     And, as another comparison, Lucy Tuning.  These often seem<br/>&gt; stereotyped as &quot;yet another irrational-number-generated tuning&quot;...yet<br/>&gt; due to the vastly different ways they use irrational numbers in their<br/>&gt; generation no two sound close and no two (far as I&apos;ve heard) can be<br/>&gt; forced to, for example, use intervals for the exact same musical<br/>&gt; purposes as each other.</p><p>LucyTuning is often stereotyped as yet another meantone temperament.  And there&apos;s only one LucyTuning.</p><p>&gt;    Consonance and periodicity, dissonance/harmonic-entropy, minor 3rds<br/>&gt; used to bring tension vs. some other interval newly devised that does<br/>&gt; the same thing, tonal centers/5-limit-like chords of resolve vs.<br/>&gt; completely different alternatives...</p><p>I think you&apos;re missing a verb there.</p><p>&gt;    In the end of the day, isn&apos;t it really more about making a music<br/>&gt; system that achieves a BALANCE between tension and relaxation...than<br/>&gt; about preserving virtually the exact methods (esp. very similar<br/>&gt; intervals and chords) to get to that point that have been used before?</p><p>What&apos;s &quot;it&quot;?</p><p>&gt;   Recently 7-limit JI and Wilson&apos;s MOS scales are perhaps the two<br/>&gt; things in the last 5 or so months that made me thing &quot;nice, this truly<br/>&gt; feels like a new avenue of expression...I have to learn something<br/>&gt; about this...&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Much of the rest of it has degenerate into people insulting each<br/>&gt; other about why each their highly subjective opinions are somehow<br/>&gt; facts.
