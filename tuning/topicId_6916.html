By 1496, Gafurius tells us that<br/>on organs, the fifths are narrowed by a certain &quot;small and hidden<br/>quantity&quot; -- one way of describing meantone at a time when the theory<br/>of intervals smaller than a comma was still a novel topic.</p><p>(Incidentally, the popularity in the early 15th century of tunings<br/>which made written major thirds with sharps into diminished fourths<br/>may be one indication pointing to the usual conclusion that meantone<br/>tuning was _not_ yet the norm. One would hardly want to go out of the<br/>way to make certain prominent thirds into _meantone_ diminished<br/>fourths, at least in a typical 15th-century musical context! Lindley<br/>similarly reasons that the keyboards described by Ramos in 1482 likely<br/>_were_ meantone, because in 15th-century Pythagorean, Ramos would be<br/>less likely to describe something like A-Gb (a schisma sixth) as &quot;bad&quot;<br/>or unusable.)</p><p>&gt;        Walter of Odington wrote in the 14th century that English<br/>&gt; choirs were singing harmony that used pure thirds.  I have seen this<br/>&gt; referred to in other sources as being one of the first instances on<br/>&gt; record of the third being regarded a concord rather than a discord.<br/>&gt; If choirs were singing it, I am going to assume that peasant<br/>&gt; folksong had been there first. Perhaps the blues artists of the<br/>&gt; first millineum?</p><p>Indeed Walter Odington suggests that Pythagorean major and minor<br/>thirds at 81:64 and 32:27 are close to 5:4 and 6:5, and this comment<br/>may reflect the predilection for thirds in some medieval English<br/>dialects of polyphony, a trait also noted by the theorist known as<br/>Anonymous IV (c. 1275), who reports that in the &quot;Westcountry&quot; of<br/>England, these intervals are esteemed as &quot;the best consonances,&quot; and<br/>that singers will conclude pieces on them.</p><p>However, while the Pythagorean thirds of Continental theory and<br/>practice are definitely regarded as unstable -- unlike the English<br/>practice as illustrated by a piece such as _Sumer is icumen in_<br/>(c. 1240?) -- theorists of the 13th and 14th centuries typically<br/>classify these intervals as &quot;imperfect concords&quot; (e.g. Johannes de<br/>Garlandia, Franco of Cologne), or &quot;medial concords&quot; (Jacobus of<br/>Liege).</p><p>For more both on the role of these thirds in 13th-century Continental<br/>music as _relatively_ blending but unstable, and on how the nuances of<br/>Pythagorean tuning may affect 13th-14th century vertical style, please<br/>see</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/13c.html</a> (13th-century style)<br/><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a> (Pythagorean tuning)</p><p>In other words, Pythagorean thirds fit a style where these intervals<br/>are treated as what I might term &quot;partial concords&quot; -- but tend to<br/>yield to tunings at or closer to 5:4 and 6:5 when thirds approach the<br/>status of _full_ and restful concords, as happens in some English<br/>styles as early as the 12th or 13th century, and on the Continent in<br/>the course of the early 15th century.</p><p>In the latter case, a modified Pythagorean system provides _some_<br/>prominent schisma thirds, but only meantone can satisfy the appetite<br/>for smooth thirds at all possible points in the gamut.</p><p>&gt;    It must be assumed that this new resource in vocal music was so<br/>&gt; attractive that the added complexity of its use was no deterrent to<br/>&gt; motet composers of the time.  Four voice harmony harmony was know by<br/>&gt; then (Perotin etal.) and I be we can Get Margo To Tell Us More<br/>&gt; (GMTTUM) about that?</p><p>Actually, the use of Pythagorean thirds as integral intervals in<br/>polyphony was recognized by Guido d&apos;Arezzo around 1030 in his<br/>_Micrologus_, where he recommends a progression from a major third to<br/>a unison as a good cadence or &quot;coming together&quot; (_occursus_) of the<br/>voices, and by the time of Perotin, they are being treated as<br/>the &quot;partial concords&quot; I describe above.</p><p>Around 1325, Jacobus of Liege makes a number of mentions of two kinds<br/>of multi-voice sonorities we know to be featured in Perotin&apos;s music.<br/>Of special interest here is the _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; in<br/>which the outer voices form a fifth and the middle voice &quot;splits&quot; it<br/>into a major and minor third: e.g. F3-A3-C4 (major third below, minor<br/>third below), or A3-C3-E4 (the converse arrangement, which he notes is<br/>used to open a motet which has come down to use in the Montpellier and<br/>Bamberg Codices). Note that here I use C4 to indicate middle C, and<br/>higher numbers to show higher octaves, etc.</p><p>Jacobus gives string-ratios for these intervals as 81:64:54 for the<br/>version with major third below; and 96:81:64 for the version with<br/>minor third below. The frequency-ratios are the converse, of course.</p><p>Jacobus endorses another favored sonority of Perotin: an outer ninth<br/>&quot;split&quot; into two fifths, e.g. G3-D4-A4, which the 14th-century<br/>composer Machaut (c. 1300-1377) also appears to favor, and even uses<br/>as the opening sonority for one of his ballades. Here a Pythagorean<br/>tuning permits an ideally euphonious tuning of 9:6:4.</p><p>It may be only natural that these sonorities should be prominent in<br/>Perotin (c. 1200), because as soon as we have composers writing<br/>regularly for three and four voices, such mildly unstable sonorities<br/>fit the scale of concord/discord for basic two-voice intervals.</p><p>Major and minor thirds are regarded as the mildest unstable intervals,<br/>while major seconds or ninths and minor sevenths are regarded as<br/>somewhat more tense, but still somewhat &quot;compatible&quot; -- and when<br/>presented in sonorities with a preponderance of ideal fifths and<br/>fourths, may indeed contribute to an overall impression of energetic<br/>blend.</p><p>Sonorities of this kind in Gothic style on the Continent are points of<br/>intriguing euphony mixed with definite tension; &quot;partial concord&quot; or<br/>&quot;relative blend&quot; may be terms as good as any, and Ludmila Ulehla&apos;s<br/>&quot;dual-purpose&quot; category (as opposed to stable concord or urgent<br/>discord) may be apposite.</p><p>Of course, those of us who favor a Pythagorean model for the<br/>Continental European music of around 1200-1400 can and should<br/>recognize that especially with non-fixed-pitch instruments (including<br/>voices), variations must have taken place. Major thirds, for example,<br/>may have leaned sometimes in the direction of 5:4, and at other times<br/>(e.g. cadences) in the direction of 9:7.</p><p>Marchettus of Padua (1318) suggests the use of very narrow semitones<br/>at cadences which would seem to call for larger-than-Pythagorean major<br/>thirds and sixths before fifths and octaves. Around 1375, one treatise<br/>in the Berkeley Manuscript suggests the use of regular diatonic<br/>semitones equal to 2/3-tone, leading modern editor Oliver Ellsworth to<br/>suggest a reading of 19-tet.</p><p>Anyway, while preferring the typical recent chronology which regards<br/>the era of 1200-1400 on the Continent as basically Pythagorean, I<br/>would certainly recognize that variations may have taken place.</p><p>However, it would seem to be the early 15th century when changes in<br/>musical style set the stage on the Continent for meantone; this is the<br/>era of composers such as Dufay and Binchois, who interestingly were<br/>described by one poet around 1440 as following the &quot;English<br/>countenance&quot; epitomized by the composer John Dunstable.</p><p>In other words, the Pythagorean-meantone transition might be seen as<br/>one feature of the shift from Gothic to Renaissance style on the<br/>Continent, with the music of Dufay&apos;s youth (c. 1420-1430), and the<br/>modified Pythagorean tunings with their alluring schisma thirds,<br/>providing a kind of stylistic and intonational bridge.</p><p>However, the intonational practices of 12th-14th century England --<br/>especially in genres which do use thirds as virtually full and stable<br/>concords rather than the partial and unstable ones of Continental<br/>practice from Perotin to Machaut -- remains a moot question. A reading<br/>of Odington to suggest that these thirds were often tuned at or near<br/>5:4 and 6:5 seems quite likely to me.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
