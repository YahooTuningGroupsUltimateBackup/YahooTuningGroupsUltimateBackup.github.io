So my new proggie works only one ET at a<br/>time.  I&apos;m looking into getting a complier for Scheme, though, so I may<br/>have a binary for it before too long.  For now, you&apos;ll have to download<br/>scheme if you want to run it (<a href="http://www.scheme.com">www.scheme.com</a>).  It works like this...</p><p>(check ET lev card &apos;(idents))</p><p>Where ET is the ET you want to check, lev is the minimum Hahn consistency<br/>level you&apos;re willing to accept (you can enter non-integer levels), card is<br/>the number of tones in your basic chord (triad=3, tetrad=4 and so on), and<br/>&apos;(idents) is the list of identities you&apos;d like to check against (the<br/>identities can be in any order).  Let&apos;s give it a try...</p><p>&gt;(check 41 1 4 &apos;(1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17))<br/>((23/63 fail) ((17) bad) (() nogood))</p><p>The result will always be a list of three lists.  In this case, the three<br/>lists are...</p><p>1. (23/63 fail)</p><p>This means that 23 out of 63 17-limit tetrads are not level-1 consistent in<br/>41tET.  That is, about 37% of them (Scheme will reduce this ratio to lowest<br/>terms, as it did in this case) &quot;fail&quot;.  If we had asked 3 instead of 4<br/>(triads instead of tetrads), this ratio would be Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos;s<br/>fractional consistency.</p><p>2. ((17) bad)</p><p>This means that of identities you listed, 17 is the only one that occurs in<br/>every failing chord.  If this list is empty, then there&apos;s no identity<br/>common to all the failing chords.  Deal is, by leaving out the &quot;bad&quot;<br/>identities, you can eliminate all the failing chords.</p><p>3. (() nogood)</p><p>This means that there aren&apos;t any identities that occur only in failing<br/>chords.  If an identity did appear in this list, you won&apos;t loose any<br/>consistent chords by getting rid of it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Aeeh- I prefer Hahn&apos;s levels, if I&apos;m going to think about levels.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s a totally different concept -- for one thing, this will increase the<br/>&gt;number of ETs under consideration as opposed to strict consistency, while<br/>&gt;Hahn&apos;s higher-level criteria only decrease the number of ETs under<br/>&gt;consideration.</p><p>A totally different way of measuring accuracy at a given limit with respect<br/>to step size.  The fractional Hahn level should follow the inverse of the<br/>Ozzard-Low consistency fairly well.  You can see it by jacking up the Hahn<br/>level in consist_badies, and watching the fail ratio go up.</p><p>Thanks, all, for humoring my debugging process!  I think we&apos;re getting<br/>close to golden on some of these.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7818 href="#7818">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2000 9:52:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote...]<br/>&gt;A totally different way of measuring accuracy at a given limit with respect<br/>&gt;to step size.

Once you take the Hahn level off<br/>1, the fail ratio will no longer be the Patrick Ozzard-Low consistency.<br/>But I still think the first part is right.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
