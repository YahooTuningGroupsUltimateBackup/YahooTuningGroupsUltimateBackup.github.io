I know that you believe that lattices<br/>show certain relationships which are, I suppose, impossible to<br/>imagine in the mind.  This allows a lattice to represent a certain<br/>harmonic structure, or at least, its possibilities or paths.  The<br/>problem is what direction should one ratio go?  How do you determine<br/>what ratios are placed where?  Do you use a subjective scale of<br/>interval &quot;importance&quot; to determine where your ratios are configured<br/>in your lattices?<br/>  I really do not see the benefit of these things in the first<br/>place.  They seem like theoretical jargon which is only able to<br/>display complexity.  What is the use of having<br/>these &quot;multidimensional&quot; lattices when it is impossible to look at it<br/>and see everything going on?  If you believe that these lattices<br/>represent harmonic structures accurately, you are wrong.  These<br/>ratios can be configured in any possible path or direction either in<br/>1, 2, or 3 dimensional space.  I do not believe you have created one<br/>in supposed &quot;7-dimensional&quot; space.  What exactly does the &quot;seventh<br/>dimension&quot; look like, and how would you know what it looks like when<br/>you live in a 3D world yourself?<br/>  I see nothing wrong with real theory in general.  Theory based<br/>primarily on objectivity is the best where certain ratios are<br/>represented symbolically.  That is fine.  I only see lattices as<br/>colorful symbolic representations based on subjectivity.  Every one<br/>of them looks alike since they are all 2 or limited 3<br/>dimensional &quot;representations.&quot; Lattices are nice geometrical patterns<br/>of complexity, but nothing more really.  Just as you can take a<br/>figure from a chemistry lab and use it as one of your harmonic<br/>lattices, it proves that a geometric figure bares no resemblance to a<br/>tonal structure.  Have you even seen what a tonal structure looks<br/>like?  No.  So does this make your lattices accurate?  No.  They are<br/>assumptions basically.  They are assumptions which assume that a<br/>certain &quot;orderly&quot; yet &quot;complex&quot; geometrical figure is able to<br/>accurately represent a certain pitch class.  This is simply untrue.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>PageWizard</p></div><h3><a id=26449 href="#26449">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 1:07:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;PageWizard, Magician of the Caverns&quot;<br/>&lt;PageWizard17@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Greetings:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   You are probably wondering what I refer to when I compare your<br/>&gt; beloved lattices to lettuce.

I&apos;ll take a lattice over a list of<br/>ratios any day of the week. The arithmetic involved in trying to<br/>relate each ratio to every other in a large list is daunting, and a<br/>lattice eliminates the necessity of doing any of this arithmetic by<br/>portraying all the consonant relationships between pitches at a<br/>glance.</p><p>&gt; Just as you can take a<br/>&gt; figure from a chemistry lab and use it as one of your harmonic<br/>&gt; lattices, it proves that a geometric figure bares no resemblance to<br/>a<br/>&gt; tonal structure.</p><p>That sentence doesn&apos;t make sense to me.</p></div>
