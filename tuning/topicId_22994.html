That&apos;s a rather bizarre view of the world, I&apos;d say.&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>This was in reply to comments that implied that most current<br/>composers (Maneri was referred to) were using microtonality<br/>to further emancipate dissonance, rather than to find greater<br/>consonance. The exception Dan seemed to see were the JI camp<br/>and Paul seemed to take some umbrage(?) at this suggestion.</p><p>I think if we look at the whole of music being made today, much<br/>of it is still staying in note vocabularies that may be referred<br/>to as consonant or concordant. Although much of it is tonal,<br/>I think some of the more &apos;accepted&apos; pieces of twentieth century<br/>classical music (which are not tonal) still recognize that<br/>concordant note relations have a very natural way of allowing<br/>one to control the tension and release in a piece of music in<br/>a way that &apos;normal&apos; listeners can relate to. (I&apos;m hearing &apos;non<br/>dissonant non-tonal and&apos;or polytonal&apos; compositions in my<br/>head by the likes of Shostakovitch, Prokofiev, Otto Luening,<br/>George Rochberg, Fritz Perl...) Even music that doesn&apos;t use<br/>a lot of tension and release (minimalism) may use a lot of<br/>those relationships (here I mainly think of Steve Reich who<br/>is my favorite from this school, hammering away at big juicy<br/>&apos;jazz chords&apos;).</p><p>Perhaps in the microtonal world one could pose &quot;except for the<br/>JI camp, microtonality is being used to find new dissonances&quot;.<br/>Those with the Perspectives microtonal issues from 1994<br/>will find Bill Shchoadstatt (Dinosaur Music) comments which<br/>are exactly along these lines (and making a jab at &apos;tiresome<br/>cranks spouting small integer ratios&apos;).</p><p>From things on this list it seems that both Harry Partch and<br/>Arnold Schoenberg felt they were liberating SLIGHTLY higher<br/>harmonics to participate in the world of concordance where<br/>only the fifth harmonic and below had been allowed.</p><p>I guess the point is that howver exceptional M is as<br/>a structure, it is (as far as I can gather) for those who<br/>want to work along the path that is suggested above.</p><p>Whether enough talented people are on that path or not<br/>to make a difference is another thing, but I think that<br/>there are many on this list who are (though they may<br/>use completely different Swiss-Army knives than MIRACLE,<br/>despite its benefits).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2001 12:58:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22994">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22994</a></p><p>&gt; From things on this list it seems that both Harry Partch and<br/>&gt; Arnold Schoenberg felt they were liberating SLIGHTLY higher<br/>&gt; harmonics to participate in the world of concordance where<br/>&gt; only the fifth harmonic and below had been allowed.</p><p>I have a paper I wrote way back in 1988 that&apos;s never been<br/>published (online or off) that I really should turn into<br/>a webpage.
