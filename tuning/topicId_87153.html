When I recorded the lead I came in on the second &quot;verse&quot; but when I mixed the tune the lead started immediately, hence the &quot;out of sync&quot; after a minute. I have tried to fix this and the result (a shorter version) can be heard in the &quot;Files&quot; link to the left if you are interested. The lead and chorda are probably still a few hundredths of a second out of sync but what I have now is clearly an improvement.</p><p>John.</p></div>
