These are sets of<br/>&gt;four tones that each contain all 12 intervals ( by inversion). These are C<br/>D F Gb, C Db E F#,<br/>&gt;C Db Eb G, C E F# G. These would be of use if you were looking for<br/>efficient material.</p><p>&#x9;This is interesting.  These sets would be very efficient taking efficiency<br/>to mean: number of distinct subsets given the total number of subsets (n!),<br/>but fairly inefficient by Rothenberg&apos;s calculation (it usually takes only 2<br/>members of the set to distinguish it from a transposition of itself).  In<br/>terms of propriety, these sets are off the board.  Balzano, in his 1980<br/>paper in Computer Music Journal, showed that the smallest proper set of<br/>12tET to contain all twelve intervals is the diatonic scale.  In fact, I<br/>think this is true of any series-of-fifths-gerenated scale tuned in the<br/>next highest ET in the series 3, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31.<br/>&#x9;Wilson&apos;s diagrams of scales generated by series of equal intervals<br/>elegantly show, I think, that the series of fifths (approximate 3/2&apos;s) are<br/>special in generating the most stable (in Rothenberg&apos;s sense) scales.  I<br/>haven&apos;t quite pinpointed the mathematical reason for this but I think it<br/>follows from the fact that the fifth (actually the fourth) arithmetically<br/>divides the octave (in the Greek sense).</p><p>jason</p><p>&gt;of defining scales you might find interesting is Moments of Symmetry .<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/mos.html</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2000 3:51:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello again, Jason,</p><p>&gt;This is interesting.

Could you explain how you&apos;re using &quot;distinct<br/>subsets&quot; here?

The diatonic scale doesn&apos;t contain all of the intervals of 19-tET.</p><p>&gt;Wilson&apos;s diagrams of scales generated by series of equal intervals<br/>&gt;elegantly show, I think, that the series of fifths (approximate 3/2&apos;s) are<br/>&gt;special in generating the most stable (in Rothenberg&apos;s sense) scales.</p><p>Can you demonstrate this?  I would be surprised if there are any special<br/>generators here -- all generators should turn out their fair share of both<br/>proper and improper scales, if the chaining is carried out far enough.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
