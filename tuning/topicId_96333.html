The black keys<br/>have an ordinary &quot;N&quot; slendro ; the closest to Mohajira is a &quot;M&quot;<br/>slendro with E  F#  A  B  C# ;<br/>a Jogyakarta type is E F# G# B C# ; a nice one is of the &quot;SJ&quot; type,<br/>in C# Eb F# G# B  that tempers 1029/1024 through the B (=55) of<br/>Mohajira.<br/>There is also a full Aeolian scale in C minor.</p><p>Have fun !</p><p>Has anyone an idea of what temperaments the tempering of both 540/539<br/>and 441/440 would best refer to ?

I note that Jove[41] transversal indeed contains all of &quot;Mohajira-to-slendro&quot; ratios, except 8/5 represented by 48/25 instead, 225/224 higher, but I haven&apos;t checked possible transpositions (BTW it looks like there is an inversion in this transversal list, between 11/7 and 14/9). So what are Jove, or Harry&apos;s generators, or other relevant ones here ?<br/>What about Miracle ? it has a perfect Mohajira and many correct 7th-limit tempered Slendros ; it also tempers 1029/1024, which is relevant in this scale with its [63 : 55 : 48 : 42 : 36] &quot;SJ&quot; type of slendro.</p><p>&gt; I posted your scale here on the Xenwiki, it seems like quite an &gt; interesting 12-note JI scale which some people find to be useful.</p><p>Thanks !
