I should have known this was coming. My argument was directed simply at the &quot;correctness&quot; and &quot;consistency&quot; of a theory that attempts to explain a musical genre. But you seem to have missed my point.</p><p>  That said, as someone with adequate traveling papers in<br/>  ethnomusicology, I am a bit astonished by the viewpoint expressed<br/>  above.

A review of your postings has<br/>  not made it clear as to whether your project is descriptive or<br/>  prescriptive or nature, and I would be delighted by some clarification.</p><p>  Astoundingly enough, you missed my point again. The theoretical model should be elegantly designed with actual practice in mind. Any approximations to the real must be carefully thought of, and nothing should be left to chance. We have all to frequently seen the results of the indoctrinations of Arel-Ezgi and their followers. The comma-deal is almost sacred and defies argument in the minds of bigots. As a consequence, many masters have succumbed to the requirements of their own teachings even if it meant complete abandon of rational methodology.</p><p>  I do not care about personal preferances here, it is the entirety of Maqam Music that I&apos;m concerned about. Some people have gone all the way trying to restrict and mold this music according to their whims. I do not wish to repeat the same mistake, nor wish to see the same mistake repeated.</p><p>  Finally, I find your blanket dismisal of the issue of fret placement<br/>  to be curious.  If I were interested in determining the pitch<br/>  preferences of musicians whose work moves me -- in a wholesome way or<br/>  otherwise -- I would surely find the aural and intuitive placement of<br/>  moveable frets to be a considerable source of information.  While the<br/>  intonation set by frets is certainly subject to a degree of<br/>  variability, the variability of wind pressure, embouchure, and angle<br/>  of air stream, as well as the placement, angle, and diameter of holes<br/>  renders the intonation of wind instruments inevitably more variable<br/>  that that of fretted instruments.</p><p>  Dismissal? Where on earth do I dismiss the imporance of fret placement? Why, it is a most fundamental issue that no sane musician can defy. It is merely the practice of tying knots to the neck nonchalantly that worries me. There can be no clean methodology if you start moving or increasing the number of the desatin the more you realize you need to do so. Have you asked, in your travels, why certain instruments are fretted the way they are? How many musicians know for sure? Or is it all too common to take frets for granted? Have you been to Turkey by the way?</p><p>  A &grave;sound&grave; system should be able explain all the pitches used in a rational, consistent, wholesome (reasonable) manner. Arel-Ezgi theory, or their predecessors for that matter, do not seem to be doing so. We have measured consistently that current theory and practice are incompatible with each other, and something must be done about it very soon.</p><p>  Daniel Wolf<br/>  Budapest</p><p>  Ozan Yarman<br/>  Istanbul</p></div><h3><a id=59140 href="#59140">ðŸ”—</a>c_ml_forster &#x3C;76153.763@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2005 6:25:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Mr. Wolf,</p><p>Exactly right!</p><p>When you have a chance please visit:</p><p><a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/flute_tone_holes.htm">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/flute_tone_holes.htm</a></p><p>Thank you very much for your well-informed acoustic analysis.</p><p>Cris Forster, Music Director<br/><a href="http://wwww.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">wwww.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;djwolf_frankfurt&quot; &lt;djwolf@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;While the<br/>&gt; intonation set by frets is certainly subject to a degree of<br/>&gt; variability, the variability of wind pressure, embouchure, and<br/>angle<br/>&gt; of air stream, as well as the placement, angle, and diameter of<br/>holes<br/>&gt; renders the intonation of wind instruments inevitably more variable<br/>&gt; that that of fretted instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf<br/>&gt; Budapest</p></div><h3><a id=59142 href="#59142">ðŸ”—</a>c_ml_forster &#x3C;76153.763@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2005 7:20:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Mr. Yarman,</p><p>You don&apos;t know the man, Talip &Ouml;zkan,<br/>and yet you compare him to other men?</p><p>And even if you did know Talip &Ouml;zkan,<br/>you _would_ compare him to other men?</p><p>You don&apos;t intimidate me at all.<br/>For that matter, nobody intimidates me.</p><p>Cris Forster</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Presumptuous still are we?
