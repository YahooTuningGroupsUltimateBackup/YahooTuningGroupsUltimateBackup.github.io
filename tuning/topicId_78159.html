Russian troops have now<br/>moved deep into the country and all out fighting is threatening tens of<br/>thousands of civilians, many of whom have become refugees overnight.</p><p>Diplomats are scrambling to find a solution, and the European Union has proposed<br/>a ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to their previous positions. China has<br/>also called for an &quot;Olympic Truce&quot;, an ancient tradition that asks all countries<br/>to cease hostilities during the Olympic Games.</p><p>Georgia has agreed to the ceasefire, and French and Finnish foreign ministers<br/>are bringing the proposal to Moscow. In the next 48 hours, a massive global<br/>public outcry would show Russian and Georgian leaders that the world wants a<br/>ceasefire, and that a full scale invasion of Georgia would seriously damage<br/>Russia&apos;s international reputation. Click below to sign our emergency petition<br/>and then forward this email to your friends and family. We&apos;ll publicize the<br/>petition in the media and deliver it the UN Security Council and Russian<br/>government:</p><p><a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/georgia_ceasefire_now/98.php?cl_tf_sign=1">http://www.avaaz.org/en/georgia_ceasefire_now/98.php?cl_tf_sign=1</a></p><p>Russia and Georgia have a long history of tensions, but the recent hostilities<br/>were sparked over a small region called South Ossetia, which is seeking<br/>separation from Georgia. For years South Ossetia has had de facto autonomy, but<br/>after clashes between Ossete militia and Georgian troops, Georgian President<br/>Mikheil Saakashvili ordered the army to occupy the small province. The Russian<br/>army immediately responded by driving the Georgian army out, bombing targets and<br/>attacking towns deep within Georgia.</p><p>History teaches us that small wars easily spark larger ones. Saakashvili has<br/>applied to join NATO, angering Russian Prime Minister Putin, who may be using<br/>the invasion to forcibly remove the Georgian leader from power. If Russia tries<br/>to remove a democratically elected President by force, the conflict could<br/>escalate dangerously, as Georgia is a close ally of the United States. The<br/>Georgian and South Ossetian people could become victims of a great global<br/>contest for power in the oil rich region.</p><p>Wars get more vicious and harder to end the longer they last. The best time to<br/>stop this one is right now -- let&apos;s act now, and help make a ceasefire the first<br/>step in a peaceful, negotiated solution to the root causes of conflict in this<br/>troubled region.</p><p>With hope,</p><p>Ricken, Iain, Veronique, Graziela, Brett, Paul, Pascal, Milena and the whole<br/>Avaaz team</p><p>PS - here are some links for more information on this conflict, and a link to<br/>learn more about Avaaz campaigns:</p><p>For more information about Avaaz campaigns:<br/><a href="https://secure.avaaz.org/en/report_back_2">https://secure.avaaz.org/en/report_back_2</a></p><p>For more background on the conflict in Georgia:<br/>International Crisis Group: &acirc;Â€ÂœWar in Georgia&acirc;Â€&#x9D; --<br/><a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5623&l=1">http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5623&l=1</a><br/>BBC: &acirc;Â€ÂœGeorgia-Russia Conflict&acirc;Â€&#x9D; --<br/><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm</a><br/>Financial Times: &acirc;Â€ÂœRussia is forfeiting its world standing&acirc;Â€&#x9D; --<br/><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90c9bd3c-6805-11dd-8d3b-0000779fd18c.html">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90c9bd3c-6805-11dd-8d3b-0000779fd18c.html</a></p><p>The European Union proposes a ceasefire:<br/>Moscow Times: &acirc;Â€ÂœEurope takes lead in bid to resolve conflict&acirc;Â€&#x9D; --<br/><a href="http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/600/42/369718.htm">http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/600/42/369718.htm</a><br/>IHT: &acirc;Â€Âœ Europe taking a diplomatic approach to Caucasus conflict&acirc;Â€&#x9D; --<br/><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/11/europe/diplo.php">http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/11/europe/diplo.php</a></p><p>------------------------------</p><p>You are receiving this email because someone sent it to you via the<br/>&quot;tell-a-friend&quot; tool at <a href="http://Avaaz.org">Avaaz.org</a>.
