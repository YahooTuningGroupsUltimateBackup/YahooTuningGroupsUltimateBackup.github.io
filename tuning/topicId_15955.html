One space might cater to focused<br/>listening and direct visual contact with the players (as in a<br/>traditional concert hall), while another might present the music at an<br/>ambient or even subliminal sound level. More active listeners could<br/>interact directly with the music in &quot;remix rooms&quot;, by adjusting<br/>loudness, mix, and balance to suit individual taste, or wander through<br/>a labyrinth of corridors and small rooms that would acoustically<br/>transform the music more with every stage.</p><p>It reminded me of the concert of electronic music up at Columbia U.<br/>last Summer as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.  Some great<br/>&quot;classics&quot; of electronic music were presented (Lansky&apos;s great piece<br/>based on highway traffic..._Night Traffic_, and the old favorites...<br/>Stockhausen _Gesange der Jungelinge_ and Varese&apos;s _Poeme<br/>Electronique--) in a traditional concert space...</p><p>BUT.. there was also a &quot;back room&quot; with *interactive* computer pieces<br/>where audience members could participate.  Unfortunately, it was a<br/>bit crowded back there... so it was hard for people to do too much in<br/>the limited time available (it was in the intermissions between the<br/>more traditional concert electronic pieces), but certainly along the<br/>same lines as mentioned in this article...</p><p>_______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
