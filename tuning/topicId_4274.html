The surface has barely<br/>been scratched; fugues, etc. need to be written.</p><p>&gt;I ask because a piece of mine, _Pequod, for Lou Harrison_ (1986) used<br/>&gt;complementary dekanies from the (1,3,5,7,9,11) and (1,3,7,9,11,15)<br/>&gt;eikosanies, for example, the dekany</p><p>&gt;1*3*11, 1*5*11, 1*7*11, 1*9*11, 3*5*11, 3*7*11, 3*9*11, 5*7*11, 5*9*11,<br/>&gt;7*9*11 was contrasted<br/>&gt;with<br/>&gt;1*3*5, 1*3*7, 1*3*9, 1*5*7, 1*5*9, 1*7*9, 3*5*7, 3*5*9, 3*7*9, 5*7*9</p><p>&gt;I found that each dekany collection was coherent, but not as a scale.<br/>&gt;Although each had a regular pattern of scale steps,</p><p>That&apos;s a stretch! Compare the regularity of having two identical pentachords<br/>within all 10 octave species of the pentachordal decatonic scale, or the<br/>distributional evenness of the symmetrical decatonic scale. What&apos;s the<br/>neatest decription you can come up with for the &quot;regularity&quot; of the pattern<br/>of scale steps in the dekanies?</p><p>&gt;they were too dense to<br/>&gt;function akin to a diatonic or pentatonic scale  or not dense and even<br/>enough<br/>&gt;to function like a chromatic scale.  Instead, subsets of each dekany seemed</p><p>&gt;to form the most important local melodic units and the dekany as a whole<br/>&gt;formed the collection or pool of harmonic resources.  I am fond of the<br/>&gt;ambiguous character of the dekanies, but just can&apos;t call them scales.</p><p>They&apos;re certainly not melodic entities.</p></div>
