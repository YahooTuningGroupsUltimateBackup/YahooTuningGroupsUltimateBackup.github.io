But I know tonight was performed under much better circumstances (for the players, certainly). The various metallophones all had their microtonalities, but it was the beautiful melodic embellishments of the singer that really brought home the other-tuning-ness of it to my ears.</p><p>...and he did all the puppets, played the percussive accents, &apos;conducted&apos; the ensemble, inserted dialogue that would be contemporary to the (student) audience. Quite a holistic effort!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
