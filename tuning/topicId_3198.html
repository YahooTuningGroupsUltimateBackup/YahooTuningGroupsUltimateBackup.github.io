I wuz looking forward to meeting and hearing so many tuning<br/>list fellow-denizens.</p><p>Since Joe can&apos;t review his own piece, maybe I can: I had already heard the<br/>midi part of his piece on his site and liked it alot - a great mix of<br/>microtonality and abstract complexity. But Joe added some visual aids as<br/>well as his reading of the poem which gave other dimensions to the work.<br/>Behind him were two posters - one of a spider web and another of the lattice<br/>being used in the music. Both were contemplated by the performer from a<br/>crouching position at different times during the piece, complete with a<br/>deftly executed  pirouette going from one to the other! (I think Joe was<br/>inspired by Sasha and Meredith&apos;s choreography). Joe&apos;s reading of the poem<br/>was somewhat spooky and ominous, with interesting timings to match certain<br/>musical gestures. All in all the combination of the music, the reading, and<br/>the &quot;performance art&quot; element worked great together to evoke a contemplative<br/>bubble of web and lattice.</p><p>Also, I have a new JI guitar piece I just recorded tonite on my website if<br/>anyones innarested:</p><p><a href="http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/justguitar.html">http://www.users.interport.net/~dante/justguitar.html</a></p></div>
