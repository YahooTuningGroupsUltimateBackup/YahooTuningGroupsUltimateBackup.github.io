As one of my pricipal obsessions is in the overtone series as produced by various means (brass, string, overtone singing, filter resonance, etc.), I am *extremely* intrigued by the possibility of an instrument which will produce an undertone series! (Particularly as there is of course no acoustic instrument which can do so.) I wonder if you have made any more observations your circuit&apos;s capabilities - can you tell have far down in the undertone series it will go, and do the tones remain discrete or do they become unstable or blur as you go down, etc, can you tell how exact it is, etc. I might want to have one built, if you would be interested....:)</p><p>Message: 6<br/>Date: Thu, 30 Dec 2004 00:13:45 -0800<br/>From: Kurt Bigler<br/>Subject: Re: Coupled Oscillators and the Musical Relativists</p><p>on 12/23/04 7:27 PM, Kurt Bigler wrote:</p><p>&gt; on 12/23/04 3:35 AM, jsnelsonone wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Season&apos;s greetings folks, thought you might be interested in this;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve just built an electronic circuit consisting of 2 coupled<br/>&gt;&gt; negative resistance oscillators.<br/>&gt;&gt; Whilst mucking around with this arrangement I came across an<br/>&gt;&gt; interesting effect, when driving oscillator was at a fairly high<br/>&gt;&gt; audio frequency and the frequency of the driven swept through it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; audio range, it&apos;s output was a stepped series of discrete intervals<br/>&gt;&gt; featuring a perfect minor chord including the octave of the tonic.<br/>&gt;&gt; Unlike the overtone series the low frequency intervals start close<br/>&gt;&gt; together and interval distance increases up the series.<br/>&gt;&gt; Is this an &quot;undertone series&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not likely, I don&apos;t think, but even with the schematic the math would be a</p><p>=== message truncated ===<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>---------------------------------<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/> Yahoo!
