I got a call from a Mr.<br/>Ferrell, an editor at the New York Times Book Review, who stated that the<br/>Jamie James review of the book had &quot;generated a lot of heat&quot; for the<br/>reviewer.  He also wanted copies of our two well-tempered CD&apos;s,(&quot;Beethoven In<br/>The Temperaments&quot; and &quot;6 Degrees of Tonality&quot;.<br/>    Soon after, there was a letter to the editor published, last Sunday in<br/>the Book Review section that mentioned 6 Degrees by name, and we have seen a<br/>lot of movement on the <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> sales ranking.  Last month, we were at the<br/>233,000 th  position, and now I see that we have moved all the way to 14,775!<br/> I think this is good progress, but haven&apos;t any idea of how many copies that<br/>represents.  Anyhow,  the use of the older tunings is beginning to spread and<br/>we are all happy for that.<br/>   I have a fellow technician that has put up my thirds charts, so if anybody<br/>is interested in how I see these things,  the link is at<br/><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kentswafford/FileSharing1.html">http://homepage.mac.com/kentswafford/FileSharing1.html</a></p><p>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/15/2002 4:34:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:40.1786dd54.2974d395@aol.com">40.1786dd54.2974d395@aol.com</a>&gt;<br/>Ed Foote wrote:</p><p>&gt; Soon after, there was a letter to the editor published, last Sunday in<br/>&gt; the Book Review section that mentioned 6 Degrees by name, and we have<br/>&gt; seen a lot of movement on the <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> sales ranking.
