Note that following MIDI conventions, I use C4 to show<br/>middle C, with higher numbers showing higher octaves:</p><p>1  2  3 | 1  2  3 |<br/>D4 E4     F4<br/>C4 B3     C4<br/>G3        F4</p><p>Here the first mildly unstable sonority, G3-C4-D4, has two richly<br/>stable medieval intervals (the fifth and fourth) plus a relatively<br/>tense major second. The overall effect is one of an energetic but<br/>relatively &quot;concordant&quot; or blending sound, in part because all three<br/>intervals are in their pure ratios: 6:8:9 (frequency-ratio), or 12:9:8<br/>(string-ratio, with the largest string length representing the lowest<br/>note, the medieval approach).</p><p>In the second cadential sonority G3-B3-E4, Pythagorean tuning makes<br/>both the relatively concordant major third and relatively tense major<br/>sixth (ranking about on par with the major second) more acoustically<br/>&quot;active&quot; or tense. These intervals have rather complex ratios of 81:64<br/>(M3) and 27:16 (M6), with the sonority as a whole at 64:81:108<br/>(frequency-ratio), or 81:64:48 (string-ratio). This somewhat tense or<br/>&quot;vibrant&quot; quality accentuates the directed cadential resolution about<br/>to follow.</p><p>In this directed progression, the major third between the lower two<br/>voices expands to a stable fifth, while the major sixth between the<br/>outer voices expands to a stable octave. Note that both upper voices<br/>move by characteristically narrow and &quot;efficient&quot; Pythagorean<br/>semitones of 256:243 (B3-C4, E4-F4), while the lowest voice descends<br/>by a generous whole-tone of 9:8 (G3-F3). These melodic motions can be<br/>expressive not only in polyphonic music like this, but also in<br/>Gregorian chant and other forms of monophonic music.</p><p>This progression takes us to the final sonority, F3-C4-F4, with three<br/>pure intervals: the octave (2:1), fifth (3:2), and fourth (4:3), or<br/>together 2:3:4 (frequency-ratio) or 6:4:3 (string-ratio). Pythagorean<br/>tuning optimizes all three intervals of this favorite medieval<br/>three-voice sonority, the standard of complete and &quot;most perfect&quot;<br/>concord.</p><p>Of course, medieval European polyphony is just one of the many world<br/>musics favoring Pythagorean tuning. As these styles become more<br/>familiar, the tuning itself may be better understood for its beauty in<br/>practice as well as its intriguing theoretical aspects.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
