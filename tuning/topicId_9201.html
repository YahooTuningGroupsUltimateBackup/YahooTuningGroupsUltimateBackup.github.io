Scales are seen as a form of cyclical Mandalas with Constant<br/>Structures being a cyclical form showing how this cycle can differ in detail yet<br/>preserve it cyclical nature. Within most of Erv&apos;s work, i feel there is a<br/>crossover from his other love, Plants. I sense he sees scales as something that<br/>&quot;grows&quot; from let us say 5 tones to 7 tones. like watching the number of leaves<br/>increase as a plant when viewed from above. I don&apos;t know if  he sees Constant<br/>Structures as a measure of anything but as a form that is grown into. This is<br/>just my personal opinion</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:CLUMMA@NNI.COM">CLUMMA@NNI.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some readers may wonder what Constant Structures and Propriety are good for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They both seem to assume that when we hear music, we attempt to assign<br/>&gt; scale degree numbers to melodic pitches.  I won&apos;t argue about that here; if<br/>&gt; you don&apos;t think it happens, then propriety and CS aren&apos;t for you.  But if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re interesting in getting it to happen or not, then they are for you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Propriety and CS both measure how easy it is for the listener to<br/>&gt; un-ambiguously assign scale degree numbers to pitches as he hears them.  CS<br/>&gt; assumes that a listener can recognize intervals by their _specific_ size --<br/>&gt; a 3:2 is distinct from a 7:5, and so on.  So CS asks, once you recognize<br/>&gt; the interval, will there be any doubt as to what scale degree it is?  If<br/>&gt; you can answer &quot;no&quot;, your scale is CS.  In the diatonic scale in 12-tet,<br/>&gt; you can answer no for all the intervals but the tritone -- it can be a<br/>&gt; fourth or a fifth; you need other notes to clarify its position in the scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Propriety does the same thing, except it assumes that listeners recognize<br/>&gt; intervals by their _relative_ size -- that the listener ranks the intervals<br/>&gt; he hears by how big they are.  The specific tuning of the intervals doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; matter, so long as their ranks are preserved.  This means the theory can be<br/>&gt; tested to see if people percieve a similarity between different tunings of<br/>&gt; a scale with the same &quot;rank-order&quot;, and if they percieve a difference<br/>&gt; between two tunings of a scale with a different rank-order.  Rothenberg has<br/>&gt; actually suggested some very cool experiments to test many aspects of his<br/>&gt; theory, which are as yet un-tested (enthno-musicology is simply not a<br/>&gt; source of reliable scientific information here).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
