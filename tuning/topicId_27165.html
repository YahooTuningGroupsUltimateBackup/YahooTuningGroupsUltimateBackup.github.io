The<br/>5-limit JI monochord is for the instruction of beginners, and Ramos<br/>himself explains that simpler ratios like 5:4 or 6:5 for thirds may be<br/>easier to follow than the more complex divisions of a traditional<br/>Pythagorean scheme. Of course, this change also appears to reflect the<br/>shift in 15th-century tastes toward more blending and restful thirds<br/>in this era of Ockeghem and other composers of his generation.</p><p>The keyboard, in contrast, is a 12-note instrument, and Ramos presents<br/>the question of whether Ab or G# is the more prudent note to include,<br/>opting for Ab as more useful. His locations on the keyboard of &quot;good&quot;<br/>and &quot;bad&quot; thirds, as Lindley observes, seem to fit meantone rather<br/>than a typical 15th-century Pythagorean tuning, where the diminished<br/>fourths or augmented seconds would actually approximate pure 5-based<br/>intervals, hardly &quot;bad&quot; by likely late 15th-century standards.</p><p>There&apos;s more about Ramos and his discussion of the Ab/G# question at:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html</a></p><p>In sum, I agree with Lindley that the keyboard Ramos describes is very<br/>likely in some kind of meantone, with the process of _participatio_ or<br/>tempering of fifths first specifically mentioned by Gafurius in 1496<br/>as something done as standard practice by organ tuners.</p><p>The alternative hypothesis would be that Ramos is describing a 12-note<br/>keyboard in some kind of Pythagorean tuning or the like. One possible<br/>bit of evidence making this a bit more unlikely, and also pointed out<br/>by Lindley, is that Ramos mentions a proposal by his friend Tristan de<br/>Silva for an extra key between F and G -- something that Ramos finds<br/>without purpose. (He recognized more merit for including both Ab and<br/>G#, the choice whose debate he addresses in his discussion.)</p><p>In a typical 15th-century Pythagorean tuning, Gb-B, a true F# key<br/>would be a very logical option for an extra note, because it would fix<br/>the Pythagorean Wolf fifth B-Gb. By 1482, however, meantone had<br/>evidently become widespread enough on keyboards that Ramos did not see<br/>the relevance of the Gb/F# question. His preferring tuning scheme is<br/>Ab-C#, with the Wolf between these notes, rather than the Eb-G# which<br/>became the standard tuning by around the second quarter of the 16th<br/>century, I might guess.</p><p>A keyboard tuned according to the instructional monochord of Ramos<br/>would have a Wolf of the 5-limit JI variety (40:27 or 27:20) at D-G,<br/>not the most practical arrangement, unless one adds extra versions of<br/>notes to handle the commas, and even there likely a highly<br/>experimental option.</p><p>Thus I strongly agree both with Lindley&apos;s thesis and with Paul&apos;s<br/>accurate guess as to that thesis: Ramos used JI for pedagogical<br/>purposes, but in his description of a practical 12-note keyboard was<br/>describing some more or less regular tuning, more likely meantone<br/>rather than Pythagorean for reasons Lindley presents at some length.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>____</p><p>1.
