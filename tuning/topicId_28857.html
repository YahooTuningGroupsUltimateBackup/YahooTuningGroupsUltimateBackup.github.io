Manuel has made it<br/>possible to reproduce his results in Scala version 18, by using SET MAXDIFF<br/>before COMPARE /SUPERSET. However, this considers the accuracy of _all_<br/>intervals, and cannot be restricted to consonant ones. To put it crudely,<br/>it finds &quot;melodic&quot; approximations rather than &quot;harmonic&quot; ones.</p><p>The others that I found, were exact subsets of particular rationalisations<br/>of Blackjack, whose consonances are of course approximated within 3.3c by<br/>Blackjack, and they are therefore &quot;harmonic&quot; approximations.</p><p>I didn&apos;t repeat any that I found by my methods, if Manuel had already found<br/>them by his, so many of those listed by Manuel are both melodic and<br/>harmonic approximations. Both kinds of approximation are of course valuable.</p><p>Here&apos;s one more harmonic subset I found only recently, using Blackjack<br/>rationalisations that you posted recently:</p><p>erlich11.scl<br/>Canonical JI interpretation of the Symmetrical decatonic mode of 22-tET</p><p>Paul, you credited me with suggesting some Scala modification relating to<br/>finding chords. I don&apos;t believe I had anything to do with that. I did<br/>however supply Manuel with an algorithm for computing the Constant<br/>Structure margin of a scale. This is now given by SHOW DATA. CS &quot;margin&quot; is<br/>the much better name that Manuel came up with for what I called CS &quot;level&quot;<br/>in the tuning-math list. The approximate subset search was my suggestion<br/>too, but its algorithm is entirely Manuel&apos;s. What would we do without<br/>Marvelous Manuel!</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
