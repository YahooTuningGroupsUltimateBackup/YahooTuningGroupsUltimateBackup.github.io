There was a nice sort of tree-like naming structure that<br/>resulted from this, which organized everything beautifully.</p><p>Then subgroups came into it and ruined everything! We&apos;re still half<br/>into that older paradigm, and half into a new one. We&apos;re treating<br/>subgroups as these weird temperaments on the side which don&apos;t really<br/>have a nice, consistent naming structure. We&apos;re typically giving them<br/>a ton of cute respellings of full-limit temperament names too, and<br/>since there are a million subgroup temperaments there are a million<br/>names for essentially different versions of the same thing.</p><p>I&apos;ll be bold and say that there&apos;s a pretty strong consensus that<br/>something about the naming system for subgroup temperaments is<br/>suboptimal as it stands. The thing we&apos;re doing now is analogous to<br/>Paul&apos;s having different&nbsp;names for &quot;negripent&quot; and &quot;negrisept&quot; and<br/>such, which also didn&apos;t catch on. Coming up with different respelled<br/>names for subgroup versions of the same thing is basically just -pent<br/>and -sept extensions all over again.</p><p>But we also don&apos;t want to pollute the hell out of the naming<br/>structure. WTF do we do? Fortunately, I think there&apos;s a simple<br/>solution to the whole problem which will make everyone happy:</p><p>Instead of considering things like <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> temperaments to be<br/>&quot;fundamental&quot; and 2.3.7 temperaments to be &quot;weird subgroup versions&quot;<br/>of those, we should consider in certain cases that a 2.3.7 temperament<br/>can be fundamental, and that a <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> temperament can be an<br/>&quot;extension&quot; to it. In other words, we should just treat it the same<br/>way we treat 5-limit and 7-limit temperaments: 2.3.7 temperaments are<br/>simple temperaments which have 2.3.5.7-limit &quot;extensions&quot;. The only<br/>difference is, instead of these being &quot;higher-limit&quot; extensions,<br/>they&apos;re more like &quot;fuller-limit&quot; extensions or something.</p><p>A 2.3.11 subgroup temperament ought to be able to have 2.3.7.11-limit<br/>extensions, <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> extensions, 2.3.5.7.11 extensions, and so on. And<br/>then, once you give something like a 2.3.11 subgroup temperament a<br/>name, there&apos;s nothing wrong with higher-limit or fuller-limit<br/>extensions sharing that name, just like there&apos;s nothing wrong with the<br/>2.3.5, <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a>, and 2.3.5.7.11 temperaments all being meantone.</p><p>Using this approach, I think that we can come up with a much stronger<br/>and sensible approach to naming subgroup temperaments - and one which<br/>will break a minimum number of existing names. It does mean that<br/>certain temperaments which were assigned systematic names (like<br/>&quot;neutraltet&quot;) or respelling of names (like &quot;skwares&quot;) may make more<br/>sense to be considered &quot;fundamental&quot; temperaments with<br/>correspondingly-named full-limit extensions.</p><p>People these days don&apos;t seem to care as much about this idea that<br/>there&apos;s a logical progression from the 5-limit into the 7-limit into<br/>the 11-limit and so on. But I note that people ARE interested in a<br/>progression from triadic harmony, to tetradic harmony, to pentadic<br/>harmony and so on. Since MOS is so popular, this means that what&apos;s of<br/>interest is in codimension-1, rank-2 temperaments on good subgroups,<br/>which extend to codimension-2 rank-2 temperaments on a larger good<br/>subgroup, which extend to codimension-3 rank-2 temperaments, and so<br/>on. This is what&apos;s taking the place of 2.3.5 -&gt; <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> -&gt; 2.3.5.7.11<br/>-&gt; etc.</p><p>I&apos;d like everyone&apos;s thoughts on this!

Well, this<br/>should BE superpyth, and <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> superpyth should be an extension of<br/>it!

And yet I think the wiki<br/>is calling this &quot;neutraltet&quot; temperament now, and mohajira is a<br/>secondary 11-limit extension on the meantone page.</p><p>I think you&apos;ll end up with like 30 &quot;core temperaments&quot; defining<br/>obvious families. Every single one will have its own unique musical<br/>structure from both a harmonic and melodic standpoint, and people<br/>won&apos;t mind remembering the names. Then there can still be names for<br/>the extensions of these families, but you&apos;ll never have to know them -<br/>just knowing about &quot;machine temperament&quot; in general would be enough to<br/>make music and communicate, even if you don&apos;t know or care about the<br/>name of the specific 13-limit extension which is present in machine in<br/>17-EDO. After all, you don&apos;t need to know what &quot;meanenneadecal&quot; is to<br/>just talk about meantone in 19-EDO, right? That&apos;d be for theorists to<br/>worry about and not composers. It sets things up like a Huffman code<br/>or something.</p><p>In hindsight, I think this is how we should have handled subgroups to<br/>begin with, since it&apos;s the same way 5-limit families were handled. I<br/>think it would just be a good thing to handle it sensibly this way<br/>going forward. This means some eggs might have to break, since there&apos;s<br/>a hodgepodge of inconsistent naming conventions going on with<br/>subgroups, but I think it&apos;ll mostly work out.</p><p>I also think it&apos;s a good idea to pay careful attention to the names<br/>that composers are actually using for some of these things, if their<br/>names are compatible with the basics of RMP at all, where no name<br/>exists or where it&apos;s ambiguous, since I have a strong feeling like<br/>this is about to jump mainstream in a big way, and the last remaining<br/>hurdle is just to organize the names and such into like 20 or 30 core<br/>new tuning systems for people to play with, the endless variations of<br/>which they never have to think about. If that means that 2.3.5<br/>superpyth should be something else so that 2.3.7 superpyth can really<br/>be superpyth, so be it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2012 12:45:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Mon, Jun 4, 2012 at 2:38 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s basically what&apos;s happening now.
