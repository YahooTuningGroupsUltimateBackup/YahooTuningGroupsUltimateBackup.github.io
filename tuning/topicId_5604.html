I<br/>also play guitar in the group, often bass lines. It is often quite<br/>noticeable how the tempered tuning of the guitar (innacuarate at that) is<br/>out of tune with the voices. I am considering having a fretless guitar made<br/>and would like to learn the experience of others learning to play such a<br/>thing. I used to play acoustic bass, so I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have much trouble<br/>playing single lines in tune, but I wonder whether parallel sixths, at<br/>moderate tempo, would be all that difficult? What about parallel open<br/>triads (e.g. on the 1st, 3rd, and 4th strings: D A F#, E B G, F# C# A, G D<br/>B, A E C#, etc.)?</p><p>John Link<br/>New York City</p></div><h3><a id=5796 href="#5796">ðŸ”—</a>Larry.Polansky@xxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>10/28/1999 5:23:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[This message contained attachments]</p></div><h3><a id=5798 href="#5798">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>10/28/1999 5:42:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: <a href="mailto:Larry.Polansky@Dartmouth.EDU">Larry.Polansky@Dartmouth.EDU</a> (Larry Polansky)</p><p>&gt;However, there are drawbacks: My wife recently, after a gig, suggested I<br/>&gt;wear a T-shirt while performing which says: &quot;They&apos;re just lines!&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t get it.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your comments about playing your fretless.</p><p>John Link</p></div><h3><a id=5799 href="#5799">ðŸ”—</a>george zelenz &#x3C;ploo@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/1999 6:24:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a> (John Link)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:Larry.Polansky@Dartmouth.EDU">Larry.Polansky@Dartmouth.EDU</a> (Larry Polansky)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;However, there are drawbacks: My wife recently, after a gig, suggested I<br/>&gt;&gt;wear a T-shirt while performing which says: &quot;They&apos;re just lines!&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t get it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Anyway, thanks for your comments about playing your fretless.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;John Link<br/>&gt;</p><p>Lines, not frets.

One was listening to a cheap<br/>classical guitar with the frets pulled through a cheap pickup about 8 years<br/>ago.  It was awful - sounded like rubber bands with no sustain.  The other<br/>was ripping the frets off the top octave of my Strat also about 8 years ago.<br/>Sustain was a problem, chords were difficult, but otherwise it sounded ok -<br/>great if I used my fingernail to stop the string.  The lower octave of that<br/>guitar was sixth tone, and I found that if I slid around the sixth tone<br/>part, it sounded almost fretless, only with the same sustain as a fretted<br/>guitar.  I bet it would be great with a sustainer pickup.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div><h3><a id=5826 href="#5826">ðŸ”—</a>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/1999 5:54:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have played a wood fretboard fretless guitar.
