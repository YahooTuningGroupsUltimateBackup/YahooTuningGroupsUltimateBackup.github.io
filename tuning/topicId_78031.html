The intervals of 12-tet are pretty easy to<br/>memorize. Nonetheless, a vocal group that has rehearsed together for a<br/>long time will intuitively learn to sing that major third 14 cents<br/>flat to get a shining, beatless chord of justice. But it&apos;s easier to<br/>think about a &quot;whole step&quot; rather than think in terms of the &quot;major<br/>and minor whole tones&quot;, if you know what I mean.</p><p>It&apos;s like what I was saying a while ago about the modes: All of them<br/>are sort of a &quot;blueprint&quot; for a certain sound. But when played live,<br/>with an orchestra, there will be little comma adjustments here and<br/>there so that in D dorian, the top D in the chord D F A C E G B D is<br/>different than the lowest D; it&apos;s boosted up by 81/08. But the<br/>musicians are still likely going to treat it like it&apos;s 2 octaves above<br/>the root, play it on their violins or sing it or what not, and then<br/>boost that top note 20 cents just because it sounds better. They&apos;d<br/>probably think they&apos;re singing the octave flat or something.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=78038 href="#78038">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2008 9:05:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Torsten,</p><p>I&apos;ll answer backwards.</p><p>&gt; I simply would like to better understand this idea, because it<br/>&gt; does not convince me spontaneously and I bet you guys gave this<br/>&gt; matter some though. For example, following this idea 5-limit<br/>&gt; music in 12 ET would be more easy to sing than in JI. Is this<br/>&gt; really so?</p><p>As long as we&apos;re talking about unaccompanied melodies alone,<br/>yes.</p><p>&gt; At various places I read that reducing the number of different<br/>&gt; intervals in a scale makes it more easy to sing. For example,<br/>&gt; this notion is one of the underlying principles in Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>&gt; writing which led to his decatonic scales.

Is this personal experience?<br/>&gt; Or have there been any empirical studies conducted?</p><p>I&apos;m not aware of any studies, but I can offer you anecdotal<br/>evidence.  Paul Erilch, myself, and Rothenberg seem to agree.<br/>And according to Paul, &quot;Even Mathieu admits that a 12-tone<br/>chromatic scale is melodically smoother in 12tET than in an<br/>unequal tuning.&quot;</p><p>Monz provides the following from a Ben Johnston article,<br/>&quot;Scalar Order as a Compositional Resource&quot;<br/>Perspectives of New Music vol.2 #2, Spring-Summer &apos;64, p.59</p><p>&quot;The two conflicting criteria which condition this are simplicity<br/>and symmetry: that is, a preference for simplicity or consonance<br/>of harmonic pitch ratios, and a preference for dividing melodic<br/>intervals symmetrically, into &quot;equal&quot; smaller intervals.<br/>...<br/>&quot;Harmonic listening is too easy and too basic to be ignored, even<br/>in purely melodic music.  Yet melodic preference for equal scale<br/>intervals is also strong.  If a scale is derived harmonically, it<br/>must consist of intervals whose melodic sizes differ by what seems<br/>a negligible amount.  What seems negligible depends mostly upon<br/>relative sizes but also upon cultural conditioning and upon &quot;how<br/>good an ear&quot; an individual listener has.&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=78039 href="#78039">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2008 10:22:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Torsten wrote:<br/>&gt; I simply would like to better understand this idea,</p><p>The phenomenon is very simply explained.  Humans judge<br/>melodic jumps that represent equal log-pitch differences<br/>to be of equal size, and we are generally capable of<br/>hearing transposition as a symmetry.  Therefore, the<br/>fewer different interval sizes in each interval class,<br/>the more numerous will be subsections of a melody that<br/>are identical under transposition.</p><p>In 12-ET, the phrase D-E-F-A-B-C consists of the congruent<br/>subsections D-E-F and A-B-C (among others).  In the<br/>5-limit intense diatonic scale, the symmetry is slightly<br/>imperfect (10/9 - 16/15 vs. 9/8 - 16/15) and this is<br/>audible.  One may prefer it or not, but one cannot deny<br/>the difference.  With adaptive JI, melodic regularity and<br/>pure harmonies should be simultaneously realizable in<br/>almost every case.</p><p>Tetrachordality (&quot;omnitetrachordality&quot; in Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>work) is explained the same way, except transpositions<br/>are deemed more effective if they are at a 5th.  This<br/>might be refined by weighting each possible transposition<br/>by the harmonic complexity of the associated interval.<br/>But simply minimizing the variety of different interval<br/>sizes in the scale should improve such symmetries across<br/>the board.</p><p>That&apos;s a lot of words but a very simple idea.  These<br/>scales are easier to sing in because when you come to a<br/>certain part, you&apos;re more likely to have sung it before!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
