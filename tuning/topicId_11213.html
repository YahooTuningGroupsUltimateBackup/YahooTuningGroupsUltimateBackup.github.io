Yes??</p><p>Many of those works may do it, but the movement is not about it, as far<br/>as I can tell.  Rather, in Rothenberg&apos;s terms, the movement was about using<br/>proper inefficient scales.  In fact, many of the serial methods are quite<br/>bent on treating the 12-tone scale as a single perceptual gestalt, wether<br/>90% of the population could hear it that way or not.  But Rothenberg does<br/>make several interesting comments on serialism and atonality in his papers;<br/>you may want to check them out.</p><p>&gt;But, if I am following the arguments correctly, the symmetrical scales<br/>&gt;are not really the Rothenberg &quot;efficient&quot; ones... it&apos;s the MOST<br/>&gt;individual scales that are &quot;efficient&quot; in determining their tonics, yes??</p><p>You&apos;re right -- the least symmetrical (most individual) scales are the<br/>most efficient (quickest) in determining their tonics.  But that&apos;s not how<br/>Rothenberg uses the word &quot;efficient&quot;.  He uses it to mean the amount of<br/>key-locating information, per tone, that a scale can provide.  Which means<br/>that the most individual scales are the _least_ efficient, since it doesn&apos;t<br/>take much before the listener knows the key.  IOW, efficient scales are<br/>the _slowest_ at telling you their key.</p><p>For completely symmetrical scales, there is no way to know the key,<br/>except from cues in the composition.  So efficiency is not defined<br/>for these scales, but Rothenberg decided to call them perfectly<br/>efficient, in that it&apos;s entirely up to the composer to tell the key.<br/>So Rothenberg intends to use efficiency to measure how much work<br/>the composer needs to do if he wants you to know the key.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
