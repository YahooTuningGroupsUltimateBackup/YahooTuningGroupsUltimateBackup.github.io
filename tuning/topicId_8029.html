It works!  It is without a doubt one of the most exciting things I<br/>have done with tuning to date... It&apos;s really amazing to hear all this<br/>stuff!</p><p>It would be terrific if Mr. Op de Coul would have a bit more of this in his<br/>&quot;readme&quot; file, since it really looks like you have to use the &quot;gsplayer,&quot;<br/>which is, of course a crummy little midi play utility that was primarily<br/>for DOS anyway.  How simple to make a MIDI tuning dump file and &quot;play&quot; it<br/>with one&apos;s &quot;regular&quot; sequencer set-up...</p><p>There were a couple little anomalies...  I noticed that setting 101 is the<br/>ONLY setting that will work for the TX81Z.   102 which is &quot;supposedly&quot; the<br/>&quot;full keyboard&quot; TX81Z setting doesn&apos;t seem to do anything at all...  At<br/>least it wasn&apos;t creating a midi sysex dump file for me.   Also, I noticed<br/>that one should ONLY be in the micro tune edit mode for &quot;full keyboard.&quot;<br/>The display on &quot;edit octave&quot; changes too, but when I tried to play<br/>something, my computer blew up.  I&apos;m going to stay out of that edit area in<br/>the future...</p><p>And yes, as you mentioned, all of these &quot;full keyboard&quot; tunings are<br/>available in &quot;performance mode.&quot;  That way, it is possible to compose<br/>pieces in a given xenharmonic tuning -- but only 1 alternate &quot;full<br/>keyboard&quot; tuning is available at a time.</p><p>As soon as I read from you that most of the tuning takes place over one&apos;s<br/>&quot;usual&quot; sequencer going through the sound card, I knew it would work...  It<br/>was all this DOS &quot;gsplay&quot; business that confused the mix...</p><p>THANKS AGAIN, THIS IS TERRIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></div><h3><a id=8030 href="#8030">ðŸ”—</a>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2000 11:50:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>J</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be terrific if Mr. Op de Coul would have a bit more of this in his<br/>&gt; &quot;readme&quot; file, since it really looks like you have to use the &quot;gsplayer,&quot;<br/>&gt; which is, of course a crummy little midi play utility that was primarily<br/>&gt; for DOS anyway.

Also be farwarned that if you send less than twelve not scales or<br/>more you may have to tweak the tx81 back by loading a preset tuning. I was<br/>trying to do lamonte pitches and was only using four notes and found the tx81<br/>was off.<br/>It just dawned on me to try the Cakewalk program and you can tweak the tempo<br/>for speed...Cakewalk will also directly dump SSEYX into the TX81 if you have it<br/>but there are freeware programs like Sendssyex  etc...</p><p>Have fun<br/>Pat Pagano<br/>SEJIS</p></div><h3><a id=8031 href="#8031">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@ezh.nl</h3><span>1/25/2000 1:46:31 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks too to Darren for responding when I was away last week.<br/>Joseph, I will make the explanation in the &quot;readme&quot; file a bit<br/>better. I don&apos;t have a TX81Z myself to test it. Anyway Darren&apos;s<br/>method works but it&apos;s maybe not the quickest way. The setting<br/>101 sends a separate message for each note to be tuned, while<br/>setting 102 creates a full dump for the whole keyboard range that<br/>the TX81Z supports. Other people have had this work too. But<br/>also the tempo in which the byte messages are sent needs to be<br/>slowed down. You can do this with gsplay by editing the command<br/>line in &quot;send.cmd&quot; like this:<br/>spawn gsplay tempo 25 xxx.mid<br/>If it isn&apos;t slow enough, try a lower value than 25.<br/>I don&apos;t know if the TX81Z needs to be set up differently in advance<br/>to accept the full keyboard dump or not.<br/>If you don&apos;t want the whole range to be retuned, you can use the<br/>optional mappings, files with &quot;.kbm&quot; extension. They need to be<br/>made active before sending with the &quot;load/map&quot; command.<br/>If you don&apos;t want an ordinary one-by-one note to key mapping,<br/>you also need this command.

Of course I have Swami Pagano to thank, or is<br/>it the other way around?!?!? Enjoy your &apos;Z!</p><p>BTW, I am now working on using Scala Keyboard Maps to map the 8 by 8 matrix<br/>onto the midi note numbers.  I will then use the PC keyboard to play the &apos;Z<br/>and to explore and catalog the harmonic resources and progressions of the<br/>matrix.  I found a somewhat buggy cheap shareware sequencer that allows you<br/>to map  note on/off messages to the PC keyboard.  It is called MIDIKEYZ or<br/>MIDIKEYS and it can be found at <a href="http://www.download.com">www.download.com</a></p><p>Good luck.</p><p>Darren Burgess</p><p>&gt; From: Joseph Pehrson &lt;<a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Darren so very, very, very, very, very, very, very much for the<br/>&gt; clarification regarding the procedure for getting Scala to &quot;talk&quot; to the<br/>&gt; TX81Z.
