Finnamore&apos;s web browser could not play the bottom two files on my<br/>Fokker page. He had to<br/>save them to disk (this is usually done by right clicking on the plug-in)<br/>and load them into his sequencer. Did any other person have this problem?<br/>What could be the cause?</p><p>***********</p><p>Regarding the tuning of the dominant seventh chord, Brett Barbaro wrote on<br/>the list that the difference between 9/5 and 7/4 is not 64/63, but 36/35.</p><p>Of course,<br/>(9/5 * 81/80) * 64/63 = 16/9 * 64/63 = 7/4, and<br/>81/80 * 64/63 = 36/35</p><p>************</p><p>In my first posting about Euler, I was trying to ask a question without<br/>really asking it.
