I wonder if the superstring<br/>&gt;has any math that could be useful to JI?</p><p>&gt;JI already has enough math that is useful to JI, so to speak. The<br/>&gt;relevance<br/>&gt;of the math is demonstrated by, and delimited by psychoacoustics, not<br/>&gt;subatomic relativistic quantum physics.</p><p>Hmmm. I am a newbie to many science and music ideas. I do know<br/>everything is supposed to be inter-related.</p><p>You say &apos;psychoacoustics,&apos; they say &apos;subatomic relativistic quantum<br/>physics&apos;... and I hear there is yet no such thing as a &apos;unified field<br/>theory.&apos;</p><p>I am looking for a good place to start on JI math. I prefer to<br/>understand things easily. The number 1 (one) keeps asserting itself<br/>to me...</p><p>I know music, like mathematics, must have an exact, unchangable<br/>basis. I feel ready to move beyond  the meta-questions and get to<br/>some concrete facts. (But I really have enjoyed all the sharing<br/>relating to meta-logic!)</p><p>Can we start a newbiestring, with some beneficially simple math? I<br/>get really bored when the obvious is not easily seen.  But, I<br/>sincerely hope nobody invents something called Just Intonation for<br/>Dummies.</p><p>Looking for a homework assignment, I am<br/>Bekah<br/><a href="http://www.childsgarden.com/music/justmuse.htm">http://www.childsgarden.com/music/justmuse.htm</a></p></div>
