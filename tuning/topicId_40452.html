I appreciate you bringing me up to speed :) with the terms<br/>used by musicologists to talk about some of the same things talked about in<br/>astrophysics.</p><p>By the way, are you aware of the Sound Waves Generated and Trapped Inside<br/>the Sun?  See clickable URL below, report from the website:<br/>===========================================================================<br/><a href="http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/p_modes.htm">http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/p_modes.htm</a></p><p>Surface Waves and Helioseismology<br/>THE SUN</p><p>5-minute Oscillations<br/>Patches of the surface of the sun oscillate up and down with a typical period of about 5<br/>minutes. The nature and source of these &quot;5-minute oscillations&quot; was a mystery for many<br/>years after their discovery in 1962. These oscillations are shown in the image on the<br/>left as areas of blue and red where the blue areas are moving toward us (blue-shifted)<br/>and the red areas are moving away from us (red-shifted). The fact that this signal is<br/>strongest near the center of the imaged disk of the sun and weakest near the edge<br/>indicates that the motions are primarily radial - inward and outward. A movie (3.7Mb<br/>MPEG) constructed from a series of these images (taken at the rate of one per minute for<br/>150 minutes with the GONG network instruments) shows how individual patches are<br/>blue-shifted and then red-shifted through several cycles. The result is an apparent<br/>chaotic vibration of the sun.</p><p>Click on image for larger version.</p><p>p-Modes<br/>The mysterious source of these oscillations was identified by way of theoretical<br/>arguments in 1970 and confirmed by observations in 1975. The oscillations we see on the<br/>surface are due to sound waves generated and trapped inside the sun. Sound waves are<br/>produced by pressure fluctuations in the turbulent convective motions of the sun&apos;s<br/>interior. As the waves move outward they reflect off of the sun&apos;s surface (the<br/>photosphere) where the density and pressure decrease rapidly. Inward moving waves are<br/>refracted (their direction of motion bent) by the increase in the speed of sound as the<br/>temperature increases and eventually return to the surface. These trapped sound waves set<br/>the sun vibrating in millions of different patterns or modes (3.7 Mb MPEG movie). Since<br/>sound is produced by pressure, these modes of vibration are called p-modes. One mode of<br/>vibration is shown in the image above as a pattern of surface displacements exaggerated<br/>by over 1000 times. A movie (1Mb MPEG without audio, 6.5 Mb MPEG version with audio)<br/>shows how this mode of oscillation consists of two oppositely moving waves.</p><p>Click on image for larger version.</p><p>Helioseismology<br/>These sound waves, and the modes of vibration they produce, can be used to probe the<br/>interior of the sun the same way that geologists uses seismic waves from earthquakes to<br/>probe the inside of the earth. Some of these waves travel right through the center of the<br/>sun. Others are bent back toward the surface at shallow depths. Helioseismologists can<br/>use the properties of these waves to determine the temperature, density, composition, and<br/>motion of the interior of the sun. A number of fascinating discoveries have been made in<br/>the last few years using the science of helioseismology. The image above (from M. J.<br/>Thompson) shows the internal rotation rate of the sun with red for fast and blue for<br/>slow. The variation we see at the surface between the equator and the poles extends<br/>inward and then rapidly disappears at the base of the convection zone (shown by the<br/>dashed line).<br/>==========================================================================================<br/> Thanks in advance,<br/>meant kindly,</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>HotJobs - Search new jobs daily now<br/><a href="http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/">http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=40498 href="#40498">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2002 5:33:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Bill Arnold &lt;billarnoldfla@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Message 40463<br/>&gt; From:  &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;</p><p>&gt; it would sound like a single note, with a very pure and boring<br/>&gt; timbre, since all the higher pitches are harmonic overtones of the<br/>&gt; lower, and not very interesting ones at that.</p><p>We now know of a number of planetary systems, but we don&apos;t have very good knowledge of any of them.
