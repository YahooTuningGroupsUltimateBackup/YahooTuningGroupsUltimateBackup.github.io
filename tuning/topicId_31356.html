The worst indicator (as I&apos;ll bet you also know) is the<br/>*depth* of the corner which Microshaft has &quot;painted itself into&quot;:</p><p>&lt;&lt;Now Microsoft has a problem. Because they chose to ignore the<br/>standard for handling downloaded files, Microsoft has painted<br/>themselves into a corner. If Microsoft suddenly changes how their<br/>browser handles downloaded files, tens of thousands (PERHAPS HUNDREDS<br/>OF THOUSANDS?&gt;&gt;</p><p>JG: Oh shit, oh dear!...</p><p>&lt;&lt;any webpage which downloads files) of webpages &quot;designed for IE&quot;<br/>will have to be rewritten. No doubt this is the issue their<br/>programmers are wrestling with right now. It&apos;s a fundamental design<br/>issue - Microsoft designed their web browser with the goal of doing<br/>what was best for Microsoft (evading anti-trust charges) rather than<br/>doing what was best for their users. In fact a proper &quot;fix&quot; of this<br/>hole probably involves de-integrating their browser and local file<br/>handling to some extent.</p><p>If you routinely browse with Internet Explorer or read mail with<br/>Outlook, keep in mind that any web page you visit or any email you<br/>open can take over your computer, steal sensitive files, destroy your<br/>machine, anything. This has been true for at least two and half<br/>years. And keep in mind that you can&apos;t fix the problem, you must rely<br/>on Microsoft to do it, if they so choose.&gt;&gt;</p><p>JG: &quot;Gag me&quot;.....

So does anybody have a complete archive<br/>&gt; &gt; of e-mails in one place?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I get the digest, so I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s a help.

As far as I know it is complete, but if there<br/>are any gaps I will let everyone know. My program can make an archive from them<br/>- main thing is getting the digests out of Outlook Express, which I can<br/>do. (I use the old Win 3.1 recorder to record key strokes and menu commands<br/>actually, works after a fahion, though I&apos;m sure there are more high tech<br/>ways of doing it. There seems to be no export to text command in OE).</p><p>My program can&apos;t work with the new on-line format because it needs the &lt;PRE&gt;<br/>&lt;/PRE&gt; tags.</p><p>It could extract the messages from the on-line expanded message list I suppose.<br/>- with some more programming, AND if I could figure out how to program the<br/>cookies.</p><p>However best is if Yahoo are interested in cooperating, and I&apos;ve written<br/>to them about it. Would have done that long ago if it wre easier to<br/>get through to the help desk.</p><p>I made the point that they could maybe earn a little from selling<br/>archives on cd for the more academic / research type groups, at<br/>reasonable price, and offered use of my program for that if they<br/>were interested.</p><p>I have been very cautious about releasing the program itself as<br/>a robot has considerable potential to be a nuisance to<br/>web administrtors / engineers, and this is of similar ilk.<br/>(It&apos;s because of the bandwidth involved in downloading so many<br/>files).</p><p>It follows the robot writers guidelines.</p><p>Alternatively, if I don&apos;t hear from Yahoo, or they aren&apos;t interested,<br/>or want to impose impossible conditions on it or something,<br/>maybe I&apos;ll just remove the downloading part of the<br/>program and release it as one to make archives from digests??</p><p>That part of it is working pretty well now with the Yahoo digests.<br/>Last time I did anything on it, it still wasn&apos;t quite right with the<br/>Mills ones for some reason, and I need to do a little more work on that part.</p><p>So anywya, depends on whether I hear from Yahoo and what they say.<br/>I can make a CD, at some point, once I have CD writer, and the<br/>new archives are fine.
