He gets handed an instrument he doesn&apos;t even<br/>know how to tune, he agrees to give a concert on it, thinking standards<br/>are so low in early music he can get away with anything? And I&apos;m supposed<br/>to walk 3 steps over to the shelf to get the book i could look up the<br/>tuning for him in?</p><p>Nope. I&apos;m one of those people who doesn&apos;t have an academic appointment<br/>but knows how to play my instruments, the ones I accept gigs on, anyhow. I<br/>may not appreciate his problem, but I recognise it -- it&apos;s called the<br/>arrogance and complacency of the credentialed. I care about this music. It<br/>is not served by people slopping their way through it in public.</p><p>Judy</p></div>
