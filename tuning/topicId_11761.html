I had no problem<br/>downloading it from the folder above, and it played all three<br/>timbres the way it&apos;s supposed to. ...?

We&apos;d<br/>&gt; better hurry up and lobby for a lot more!!</p><p>Hi Monz...</p><p>Well, now with the Web access one really doesn&apos;t have to<br/>&quot;unsubscribe&quot; by e-mail... you just change your settings on the<br/>Website... to get digest, read only on Web, or get individual<br/>e-mails.<br/> (Who would want THAT anymore!)  You can go back and forth as many<br/>times as you wantto change the settings...</p><p>I sympathize with Mr. ffitch&apos;s comments... whom I recognize as a<br/>CSOUND expert.  Before I started paying for &quot;unlimited Web&quot; I had<br/>similar problems.  I can also understand the problems in places like<br/>Hungary.  Well.. it could be worse, there aren&apos;t even PHONE lines in<br/>Africa...</p><p>HOWEVER, the problem is, for many of us who DO have access... there<br/>are now MANY LINKS, not only to files on the egroups site, but all<br/>over the place on people&apos;s websites.  I find I can&apos;t really get that<br/>much out of the Tuning List anymore without following the Web links<br/>right as I do the reading.  That makes it almost imperative for me to<br/>be &quot;on line&quot; while reading....</p><p>I&apos;m not certain how one can get more Webspace at e-groups-- or even<br/>if it is possible.  Anybody know?  Actually, there are lots of places<br/>now where we could LINK to free web space.  Although it was not<br/>terribly reliable, the site I had at Tripod had 50 megs of free<br/>space... and I believe similar arrangements can be made through Yahoo<br/>and other places now.  (As long as you can stand the advertising<br/>banners on the top).</p><p>________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
