Learning experientially, the musicians<br/>involved have discovered that EXACT cents values are necessary for quick and<br/>facile reading.</p><p>As a player, on the bassoon for example, if I have to play an E +2, I don&apos;t<br/>have to add any keys to succeed.  However, if I say JI only, it might change<br/>the sure-footedness of the A I played just before it.  Or there might not<br/>even be an A, but an odd interval before it.</p><p>Still, you might ask, why put +2 when there is so little difference on an<br/>instrument that can&apos;t distinguish that well on its own (not unlike a trumpet<br/>in this sense)?  It matters, it matters, it matters.  All disaster would<br/>break out otherwise for this would be indicative of the musicians NOT having<br/>the EXACT position of the pitch in the mind which is necessary for the work<br/>we do.  Without the +2 on the E it is most likely that the very next note<br/>would be played wrong since we would lose the sense of relativity.  I do not<br/>have perfect pitch.</p><p>As a vocalist performing music of Harry Partch it is even more clear to me.<br/>When there is a repeated note like in &quot;Long Departed Lover&quot; one cannot merely<br/>repeat an exact pitch like it was a physics laboratory.  The mind zeros in on<br/>the EXACT pitch so that there is a human coloring to the phonemes of the<br/>words which are all important.  One does not speak naturally with exact<br/>repeats of pitch because that is the sound of the &quot;monotonous&quot; which is what<br/>put us to sleep in school when we were whelps.</p><p>The actual pitch inflections that ornament a repeated note are micro-micro,<br/>so small as not to register in the intellect for but a few.  It&apos;s close to<br/>using a different vowel in the head to change the tone for a singer.  To the<br/>surprise of some, it involves the juggling of intervals that may best be<br/>indicated by cents.  This choice of cents has no longer anything to do with<br/>equal temperament.  It is the grease by which performers can, and do, shimmer<br/>the sound, dazzle the listener, and keep the interest of the listener, all<br/>without vibrato.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>&gt; Gerald, at least with instruments, &quot;specific&quot; amounts of deviation have been</p><p>&gt; &gt; seen many, many times over.
