As opposed to having fixed<br/>&gt; pitches. Regardless David&apos;s scale is the inversion of the<br/>&gt; pentatonic I prefer as a pentatonic. I tend to think of Paul&apos;s<br/>&gt; as the blues scale with the understanding that eb-e is a<br/>&gt; variation of a singular pitch with the same around f-f# and Bb<br/>&gt; also. The conditions that determine the use of one end of the<br/>&gt; variation to the other are probably  complex beyond a simple<br/>&gt; explanation!</p><p>[Beardsley]<br/>&gt; You&apos;re absolutely right....but....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A - C - D - E - G - A would be a text book example of<br/>&gt; a blues scale.</p><p>I think to compare it effectively with Paul&apos;s original scale,<br/>it should be transposed up a &apos;minor 3rd&apos;:</p><p>C - Eb - F - G - Bb - C</p><p>It&apos;s true that the guitarist&apos;s blues scale is basically just<br/>a pentatonic, because guitarists (and vocalists) can bend<br/>the notes to other pitches when desired.</p><p>This is why I find Kraig&apos;s comment that &apos;eb-e is a variation of a<br/>singular pitch with the same around f-f# and Bb also&apos; interesting.</p><p>The standard blues scale for keyboard players is a heptatonic<br/>scale, and in this key, is:</p><p>C - Eb - F - F# - G - Bb - B - C</p><p>because on a piano, with no pitch-bend available, a blues<br/>pianist simply uses both notes! (F/F# for F, and Bb/B for B)</p><p>Paul&apos;s scale is quite similar to this, the major differences<br/>being that it contains the &apos;major 3rd&apos; but not the &apos;leading tone&apos;.</p><p>I should emphasize, also, that the &apos;leading tone&apos; in this<br/>keyboard scale *is* used regularly in descending riffs:<br/>C - B - Bb - G.</p><p>My Robert Johnson analysis may shed some light on blues scales<br/>used by vocalists (that tune is in the key of &apos;D&apos;):<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a><br/>(with newly-edited music example - more legible than before)</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that Johnson was purposely exaggerating<br/>some of the bending in this song, to mimic the drunkenness alluded<br/>to in the title.

He makes a point in later chapters of emphasizing that<br/>great soloing involves *bending* the &apos;blue&apos; notes, and describing<br/>how to do that (without microtonal quantification, however).</p><p>The F#/Gb would be one of these: a sharpened F or a flattened G,<br/>as opposed to actually being a distinct scale-note itself.</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt; In the blues, besides the so-called &quot;blues scale&quot;, one often<br/>&gt; uses the major pentatonic, but rarely for the whole song<br/>&gt; (outside of country music) -- more often one alternates passages<br/>&gt; of major pentatonic with ones in the minor pentatonic or blues<br/>&gt; scale.</p><p>Yes, this was a point I made in my original posting on Daniels.</p><p>In the same way I have described above regarding F#/Gb,<br/>when the &apos;relative&apos; or &apos;major&apos; version is in effect,<br/>the D#/Eb would not be a scale-tone itself, but rather<br/>a sharpened D or a flattened E.</p><p>Of course on a guitar, it is only possible to fret a note<br/>below the &apos;target&apos; and bend upwards.  My description about<br/>&apos;flattened&apos; notes is concerning the theory or the vocals.</p><p>[Erlich]<br/>&gt; Chords are not constructed from the blues scale.

At any rate, unless I&apos;m *really*<br/>listening hard, as under experimental conditions, in actual music<br/>I usually can&apos;t tell the difference, , between, for example, 18:11<br/>[~852.6 cents] and 13:8 [~840.5 cents].</p><p>This is along the lines of, or actually even a bit better than,<br/>the &apos;error&apos; commonly accepted in 12-eq representing 5-limit.</p><p>I&apos;m going to re-post my Semitones-chart of the Robert Johnson<br/>vocal scale from &apos;Drunken Hearted Man&apos;, this time including the<br/>ratios that I put into my notated example, in hopes that there<br/>will be some dialog here on what ratios may be used to interpret<br/>these pitches.
