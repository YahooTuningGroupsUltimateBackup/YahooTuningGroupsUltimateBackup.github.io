So a lot of the quality of the final product<br/>is due to him.</p><p>But for sure, the proper retuning for Mahler is meantone.<br/>He himself said to Schoenberg that he regretted that<br/>European music &quot;lost a lot of harmonic subtleties&quot; by<br/>switching from meantone to 12-tone equal-temperament.</p><p>It says a lot for Schoenberg&apos;s own strength of character<br/>that despite his great admiration for Mahler, he clung to<br/>exactly the opposite position, enthusastically embraced<br/>12-tet, and created a whole new system of musical composition<br/>based on that tuning.</p><p>In fact, Schoenberg really deserves a tremendous amount<br/>of credit, for being the composer who was brave enough<br/>to recognize the fact that 12-tet by his time had been accepted<br/>as the standard tuning, and that music-theory all thru the<br/>&quot;common-practice&quot; period (1600-1900) was based on<br/>meantone and therefore by his day was limited, because<br/>12-tet is not only a member of the meantone family of tunings<br/>but also belongs to many other families.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
