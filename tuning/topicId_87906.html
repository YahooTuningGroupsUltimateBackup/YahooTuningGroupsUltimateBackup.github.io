What counts as better or worse, and how do you<br/>quantify that?&quot;<br/>  Again, there&apos;s no ultimate &quot;better or worse&quot;, only different categories.  A scale&apos;s being stronger in one category could easily come at the expense of it being weaker in a different one.</p><p>  One of our scales may, for example, have on the average purer thirds and fifths than the others.  A different one may be better for narrowly-spaced chords.  Yet another may better fit adaption of music from a certain composer or era (such as Marcel&apos;s tunings and Beethoven&apos;s music).<br/>  And, of course, I&apos;m not saying the above things have to be the categories. I figure it could help a lot if we all individually make a list of strengths and weaknesses of our scales and then compare and then, say, see if any of each others&apos; categories or strengths/weaknesses also apply to own own scales.  The end result...I figure musicians can quickly look at the lists and examples of chords and such for each scale and quickly decide what they want, without needing to have the patience to spend hours experimenting with each one to learn partly by process of elimination what each scale is good at or where the chords are.  Of course if you have any suggestions for categories I&apos;m all ears. :-)</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: genewardsmith &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Fri, April 23, 2010 2:56:58 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Marcel</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;     We&apos;ve formed this situation where we all, IMVHO, have fairly competitive tuning and/or scale systems.

(16/11) * (385/384) = 35/24.&quot;</p><p>    I am all for Gene&apos;s technique here.  I use it very frequently myself to round anything up to about 10 cents off to x/9, x/11, or even occasionally x/13 (obviously the 385/384 margin of error fits well within that).  Works incredibly well.<br/>  As a side note, in some cases, I find it amazing just how consonant 11-limit harmony can be despite the high o-tonal fractions involved...often times I find there&apos;s nothing wrong with &quot;accepting&quot; an &quot;x/11&quot; interval.  It also seems one of the more periodic intervals hovering in the neighborhood of the perfect 5th...other fractions in that area include 13/9 = 1.4444, 19/13 = 1.46153......20/13 = 1.5384, 17/11 = 1.545454, and 14/9 = 1.5555.

I think you are confusing the beauty of equations and pure harmonic sonorities&nbsp; for what makes music interesting.&nbsp; Yes, pure major and minor chords are ravishingly beautiful, but a tremendous range of great music is not dependent on these pure sonorities.&nbsp; The way compelling music functions--for example, Classical music, which is largely based on triads--is usually not by moving from one perfect sonority to the next, but rather by interweaving motives with chord progressions that balance movement away from and back toward a center, with all sorts of interesting voice leading (suspensions, etc.) on the way.&nbsp; Then composers leave this tonal center and move to another, then in the development section explore more distant keys, and so forth.&nbsp; In the best music, a powerful drama results.&nbsp; The scientific understanding you are trying to develop would have to encompass all of this, and also be<br/> able to tell us why when Boccherini follows a scheme like this, it usually comes out as less interesting and dramatic than when Mozart or Haydn does.</p><p>Your model would not work very effectively for Wagner&apos;s music, and would not apply to the music of Debussy and many later composers.&nbsp; So I don&apos;t see how you can achieve your aim of showing how music &quot;really functions,&quot; unless you limit the range of the term &quot;music&quot; to an absurdly small number of pieces that happen to be more or less suitable to your theory.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to avoid misunderstandings, perhaps you should avoid large-scale pronouncements about the way &quot;music really functions,&quot; and the like.

The challenge was that of raising performers to the level that they could achieve what barely seemed possible.</p><p>Ah yes, but for for instance harmonic-6-limit music, offcourse it looses some when played in 12tet, but not that great a deal, the main message comes across largely.<br/>I hope perfect JI will achieve a deep understanding of the workings of music, and that this allows better music to be composed, which would when played in 12tet still be amazing.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=88092 href="#88092">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 1:33:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Cox Franklin &lt;franklincox@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The mastery I mean is to know in a scientific way how music really functions.</p><p>Then the obvious place to start is with scientific studies of how music functions, which I&apos;ve never seen you mention.</p></div><h3><a id=88093 href="#88093">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 1:36:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; The mastery I mean is to know in a scientific way how music really<br/>&gt; functions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the obvious place to start is with scientific studies of how music<br/>&gt; functions, which I&apos;ve never seen you mention.</p><p>I&apos;ve been reading in this area for some time, but nothing struck me as<br/>giving any answers.</p><p>I also somewhat trust this list, in that if something truly gave/had the<br/>answers, it would have passed here and stuck.<br/>Nothing did apparently.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=88094 href="#88094">ðŸ”—</a>Cox Franklin &#x3C;franklincox@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 1:42:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My&nbsp; point exactly; we should therefore be cautious about claims that X or Y&nbsp; (for Marcel, Partch or Johnston) hasn&apos;t &quot;mastered&quot; JI.

I agree that you must know history to master something in existence IE to master common-theory music you must learn common-theory history.<br/>   However, I still don&apos;t see how this applies to non-common-theory music...or to music as a whole unless you assume all music must be common theory.  Easy example, the same rules that apply for even 7-tone scales in 12TET aren&apos;t going to be the same as those that apply for a scale like C D D# F# G where G is the period instead of the next C and the first, third, and fifth would mean something completely different.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But let&apos;s say that &quot;history is bunk,&quot; and that mastery consists of<br/>comprehensive knowledge of whatever is around at the present, say in<br/>the field of JI.  In order to attain this comprehensive knowledge, one<br/>has to listen to a great deal of music and learn how to communicate<br/>effectively with others.&quot;<br/>   I&apos;m mixed about this.  I would view what someone hears when doing so as a symptom.  This appears to work in the same way you need sensation (input through the 5 senses) to gain knowledge where the senses let you see the symptom, but it&apos;s largely up to you to determine the cause and if you do/don&apos;t agree with it<br/>    So what people interpret as the &quot;cause&quot; may vary.  One person may say &quot;this works because of the consonance achieved&quot;, another may say &quot;this works because of the type of instruments used&quot;, and yet another may even say &quot;a lot of this does not work...let me try to do something completely different&quot;.<br/>   Correct me if/where you think I&apos;m wrong, but Beethoven seemed to, in many ways, rebel against history: defying the rules of things like limits on the size of chords or levels of dissonance that were considered standard.  At least from what I know in many ways he became famous much because he was not a master of the current art at his time, rather, he changed the art.   That&apos;s not to say the current art was bad or rendered void, but that his art was both different and able to catch on among many people eventually.  It became...an acceptable alternative.</p><p>&gt;&quot;At some point, someone besides yourself will come to realize the<br/>significance of what you are doing, if indeed it is significant.&quot;<br/>    Right, but this can often take an incredibly long-time.  For Beethoven, far as I know, by the time people really caught on he was dead.  If Beethoven was convinced he either had to gain recognition quickly or accept what he was working on as invalid, he may very well have given up.</p><p>  Sure, if someone approves of your work quickly there&apos;s probably a better chance it is right on the average and you could even justifiably say &quot;if no one or very few approve on average, you are most likely wrong&quot;...but that by no means says one has to always go with the other.  To me at least, much of the micro-tonal movement is based on a certain stubborn-ess of &quot;most people think we&apos;re wrong, but we&apos;re pretty sure we have a good point so we keep going anyhow&quot;...especially those micro-tonal tunings not related to the early world tunings that came long before 12TET (IE ones that were never widely accepted in any form in history) such as Sethares&apos; use of 10TET.</p></div><h3><a id=88110 href="#88110">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 3:54:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dr.Cox&gt;&quot;Your model would not work very effectively for Wagner&apos;s music, and<br/>would not apply to the music of Debussy and many later composers.

In micro-tonal music, this gets even more varied as you get both variable tunings and variable theories being combined in different ways, thus yield more different ways to &quot;trade&quot; what the strengths and weaknesses of the music are.  Music of all forms seems to be a game of balance...for everything you gain you lose something elsewhere...and sure you can maximize what you gain and minimize what you lose so far as making tuning systems that accommodate to certain styles...but you can only go so far: music is far too abstract an art to be singled down to one common theory, even if it is brilliant.  If you want an example of a brilliant theory people have tried to single all music down to (but has had the adverse effect of limiting musical diversity<br/> and not accommodating as well to certain styles as other tunings) here&apos;s an easy one: 7-tone diatonic scales under 12TET.</p></div><h3><a id=88111 href="#88111">ðŸ”—</a>Cox Franklin &#x3C;franklincox@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 4:11:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Both the Johnston and the Schweinitz-Sabat notations are absolutely clear regarding the amount a note is &quot;altered&quot; (i.e., from 12 edo), but the Schweinitz-Sabat notation is much easier for me to process (those who have been working with Ben&apos;s notation for ages swear by it).

Some basic musical issues will still have to be faced, though, no matter what scales one is using. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>I believe you meant to write &quot;common-practice theory.&quot;<br/>You spoke of &quot;existing art form&quot; as though in the past tense--but that&apos;s what music is now. It has a long and robust history, which is precisely why people place such a high value on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly seems to me that any field that has no historical continuity will have no lasting value; obviously, when one turns 40, the next group of 20-somethings will declare a new art form, invalidating everything that preceded them. &nbsp;With this sort of attitude, why should anyone outside of this group really care about it?<br/>What you wrote about Beethoven is incorrect. &nbsp;Beethoven studied the music of Mozart thoroughly and studied with Haydn and Albrechtsburger as well. He was still taking lessons in composing in Italian from Salieri after he had started to become famous throughout Europe. &nbsp;There has rarely been a composer with such a burning desire to thoroughly master his or her art. &nbsp;In the 18-teens he was one of the most respected composers in Europe, but spent years studying early music (i.e., Bach, Handel, and even Palestrina) in order to write the Missa Solemnis. He was innovative, but his innovations were grounded in a thorough understanding of and respect for the art form he had inherited.<br/>Beethoven&apos;s music was controversial, but he actually had a successful career, considering that his main works were not designed to be &quot;audience-friendly&quot; (his &quot;Wellington&apos;s Victory&quot; symphony was designed to succeed, and indeed it became his most popular work in his lifetime). &nbsp;A good deal of this is because he had a few progressively-minded supporters among the nobility, the most important of these being the brother of the Austrian emperor. &nbsp;But people were fairly open-minded at that time as well. Beethoven was also somewhat lucky in that he came to Vienna just after Mozart had died and at the tail-end of Haydn&apos;s career; if Mozart had lived another 20 years, it&apos;s unlikely that Beethoven would have gotten the support that he needed to continue composing after he went deaf.<br/>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Sun, 4/25/10, Michael &lt;<a href="mailto:djtrancendance@yahoo.com">djtrancendance@yahoo.com</a>&gt;

and that mastery consists of<br/>comprehensive knowledge of whatever is around at the present, say in<br/>the field of JI. &nbsp;In order to attain this comprehensive knowledge, one<br/>has to listen to a great deal of music and learn how to communicate<br/>effectively with others.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m mixed about this.&nbsp; I would view what someone hears when doing so as a symptom.&nbsp; This appears to work in the same way you need sensation (input through the 5 senses) to gain knowledge where the senses let you see the symptom, but it&apos;s largely up to you to determine the cause and if you do/don&apos;t agree with it<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what people interpret as the &quot;cause&quot; may vary.&nbsp; One person may say &quot;this works because of the consonance achieved&quot;, another may say &quot;this works because of the type of instruments used&quot;, and yet another may even say &quot;a lot of this does not work...let me try to do something completely different&quot;.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct me if/where you think I&apos;m wrong, but Beethoven seemed to, in many ways, rebel against history: defying the rules of things like limits on the size of chords or levels of dissonance that were considered standard.&nbsp; At least from what I know in many<br/> ways he became famous much because he was not a master of the current art at his time, rather, he changed the art.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&apos;s not to say the current art was bad or rendered void, but that his art was both different and able to catch on among many people eventually.&nbsp; It became...an acceptable alternative.</p><p>&gt;&quot;At some point, someone besides yourself will come to realize the<br/>significance of what you are doing, if indeed it is significant. &quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, but this can often take an incredibly long-time.&nbsp; For Beethoven, far as I know, by the time people really caught on he was dead.&nbsp; If Beethoven was convinced he either had to gain recognition quickly or accept what he was working on as invalid, he may very well have given up.</p><p>&nbsp; Sure, if someone approves of your work quickly there&apos;s probably a better chance it is right on the average and you could even justifiably say &quot;if no one or very few approve on average, you are most likely wrong&quot;...but that by no means says one has to always go with the other.&nbsp;

I completely agree on this.&nbsp; &quot;Even&quot; in the &quot;simplified&quot; world of common theory music, if you are making a scale that works better at one kind of music, chances are it will work worse at another type of music.&nbsp; In micro-tonal music, this gets even more varied as you get both variable tunings and variable theories being combined in different ways, thus yield more different ways to &quot;trade&quot; what the strengths and weaknesses of the music are.&nbsp; Music of all forms seems to be a game of balance...for everything you gain you lose something elsewhere... and sure you can maximize what you gain and minimize what you lose so far as making tuning systems that accommodate to certain styles...but you can only go so far: music is far too abstract an art to be singled down to one common theory, even if it is brilliant.&nbsp; If you want an example of a brilliant theory people have tried to single all music down to (but has<br/> had the adverse effect of limiting musical diversity and not accommodating as well to certain styles as other tunings) here&apos;s an easy one: 7-tone diatonic scales under 12TET.</p></div><h3><a id=88125 href="#88125">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 5:19:29 PM</span><button style="float: right;

It is drone-based music. &nbsp;Common-practice tonality (such as the Beethoven piece you have been working one) is not a drone-based system. &nbsp;Occasionally pedal tones appear in common-practice music, but this is not by any means the norm. &nbsp;You can have the opening theme of a sonata form in a certain key without any requirement that all chord harmonize perfectly with the tonic tone. &nbsp;In fact, some chords, such as the Dominant chord, are dissonant to the tonic. &nbsp;One can even briefly modulate into another key and return to the tonic. &nbsp;In Beethoven&apos;s op. 101 sonata, first movement, he never cadences on the tonic chord until near the end of the piece, but the opening theme is nevertheless in the tonic key--even though the tonic chord barely appears in the opening theme.<br/>You really need to go to school, take a couple years of theory, and learn a great deal more about the tonal system.<br/>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Mon, 4/26/10, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Marcel<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Monday, April 26, 2010, 2:36 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You have not.

It is drone-based music.<br/>&gt;  Common-practice tonality (such as the Beethoven piece you have been working<br/>&gt; one) is not a drone-based system.  Occasionally pedal tones appear in<br/>&gt; common-practice music, but this is not by any means the norm.  You can have<br/>&gt; the opening theme of a sonata form in a certain key without any requirement<br/>&gt; that all chord harmonize perfectly with the tonic tone.  In fact, some<br/>&gt; chords, such as the Dominant chord, are dissonant to the tonic.  One can<br/>&gt; even briefly modulate into another key and return to the tonic.  In<br/>&gt; Beethoven&apos;s op. 101 sonata, first movement, he never cadences on the tonic<br/>&gt; chord until near the end of the piece, but the opening theme is nevertheless<br/>&gt; in the tonic key--even though the tonic chord barely appears in the opening<br/>&gt; theme.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, you&apos;re right.<br/>It is my personal defenition of tonality.<br/>But I personally &quot;hear&quot; chords in a tonal piece as having a color relevant<br/>to the tonic.<br/>I find it personally the most beautifull way to hear music, and it makes<br/>sense to me in this way.<br/>This is probably the part I can worst explain.<br/>But I feel my defenition of tonality has a deeper connection to music.<br/>The tonic drone thing still works wonderfully well in actual common practice<br/>music though.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; You really need to go to school, take a couple years of theory, and learn a<br/>&gt; great deal more about the tonal system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well I want to do things my own way.<br/>But I am secretly learning normal music theory at home now too ;)<br/>Though I spend too much time on my own theory, so it&apos;s going a bit slow.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=88153 href="#88153">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 8:14:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You speak of your &quot;system&quot; as if it actually exists.

That<br/>is precisely what Partch and Johnston achieved.&quot;<br/>    Actually, I agree one can achieve compositional mastery with new scales.  To restate<br/>A) To master &quot;common music theory&quot;, I agree one must study common theory<br/>B) To master the creation of ones own music theory, one must define several concepts that solidify the theory as being based on more than a series of unproved assumptions.  Just as I recall your said with calling what Marcel&apos;s trying for as &quot;a different level of mastery&quot;.  One example of part of this would be Sethares&apos; look at the &quot;circle of thirds&quot; in 10TET on <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/circleofthirds.html">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/circleofthirds.html</a>.<br/>C) To master a new scale (IE one created with B)...one must take into account virtually all compositional flexibilities that can be achieved with A.  I admittedly don&apos;t know much about Johnston, but the way Partch handled and categorized chords plus their dissonance levels using o-tonal and u-tonal relationships in his tonality diamonds and then used them to compose seems to bridge the gap between B) and C).<br/>  But (my point is) even then one is not &quot;mastering something that&apos;s been established&quot; IE through history...but rather establishing in via B) and then mastering its use via C).</p><p>&gt;&quot;&quot;Mastery&quot; doesn&apos;t mean &quot;neat,&quot; &quot;unusual,&quot; &quot;cool, &quot; &quot;original,&quot; etc.&quot;<br/>    I understand that.  My own wording on this would be &quot;you know how to handle a vast majority of what has been done and can be done with a given theory or art&quot;.  So, if I have it right, to master a new art, you first have to establish the new art and its scope before you cover that scope.  So while I&apos;d say a theory has to be &quot;original&quot; to be considered new, but simply by virtue of being new something can&apos;t automatically be considered &quot;established&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Even Partch didn&apos;t invent something wholly new; his Genesis of a Music is discusses historical tuning systems at length.&quot;<br/>   Agreed.  Though I don&apos;t consider Partch&apos;s work that deviant...at least from what I&apos;ve read is seems just a way to summarize why classical intervals and chords work the way they do and then expand it to cover other interval types.<br/>----------------<br/>   Come to think of it, &quot;even&quot; Sethares&apos; work was based somewhat on history IE Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s dissonance formulas...only he used them in a drastically different way.  But at the same time, I&apos;d argue just because Isaac Newton uses algebra in calculus doesn&apos;t mean calculus is &quot;just an extension of algebra&quot;...I&apos;d give him credit for essentially creating a new type of math.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I<br/>was also speaking primarily about JI, which does have a centuries-long<br/>history, not about newly-invented scales. Some basic musical issues<br/>will still have to be faced, though, no matter what scales one is<br/>using.   &quot;<br/>  That&apos;s the funny thing about JI.  On one hand, it does cover a century-long history, primarily (at least from what I&apos;ve learned so far) because it can be used to explain why even things like Pythagorean were designed the way they were.<br/>  On the other hand, I see huge potential in covering the uses of JI that aren&apos;t covered (or at least not covered much) in past theories to the best of my knowledge, such as the combination/&quot;balancing between&quot; of Sethares&apos; critical band dissonance theory with Elrich&apos;s theory of harmonic entropy.  Do you think it would be fair to say that &quot;balancing&quot; an area that has not been &quot;established&quot; much yet?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I believe you meant to write &quot;common-practice theory.&quot;<br/>You&apos;re right...that I did.  I will write that instead of &quot;theory of common practice&quot; or any other permutation of that in the future.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You spoke of &quot;existing art form&quot; as though in the past tense--but that&apos;s what music is now.&quot;<br/>   Well...at least what &quot;established&quot; music is now to a huge majority of those.  I don&apos;t see why anything loaded with scientific evidence that goes beyond common practice can&apos;t be considered a new art form.  I&apos;d actually credit what Sethares does using spectral alignment to enable tons of non-&quot;common practice theory&quot; intervals to be a new, and not existing, art form.</p><p>  And same goes with the side of Partch&apos;s research that did not involve either &quot;common practice theory&quot; intervals or emulation of them...they seem to lie as a key to another musical world to be unlocked fully by future generations; perhaps to be encompassed into a new alternative to common theory in the same way Calculus was used to unlock the key to things such as mp3 compression (again I&apos;d lean toward mp3 compression not simply being an &quot;extension of Calculus&quot;...but a new art form).   Sure we on the list have virtually all heard of Partch, but I wonder how many people who graduate from music school have actually composed using his scale system?</p><p>&gt;&quot; It<br/>certainly seems to me that any field that has no historical continuity<br/>will have no lasting value; obviously, when one turns 40, the next<br/>group of 20-somethings will declare a new art form, invalidating<br/>everything that preceded them.  With this sort of attitude, why should<br/>anyone outside of this group really care about it?&quot;<br/>   Well I don&apos;t view it as over-writing...I view it as giving new alternatives.  Say someone came up with a new way of designing scales not based, say, on mean-tone of JI.  If you re-tuned older music to that system, it&apos;s almost guaranteed you&apos;d lose some of the original artist&apos;s intention, no matter how &quot;flexible&quot; or &quot;good&quot; the system is.<br/>  To me, music is not at all like the field of, say, computer processors where the new version is virtually always better than the old for all uses...for that reason of preserving artistic intention.  My opinion is songs written in mean-tone will always sound most genuine in mean-tone...no matter what variations on, say, JI come about.<br/>  Even now, many people often opt for older music and music theories...that&apos;s the wonderful thing about music that the subjective aspect makes it so there&apos;s little danger of everyone &quot;having&quot; to agree on a single definition or theory of &quot;better&quot;<br/>.  If music were almost completely objective, like many sciences turn out to be, there would likely be only a few ways to get &quot;better&quot;...but music is too subjective IMVHO to ever fall completely into that sort of single path or single theories out simply because of age.</p><p>&gt;&quot;In<br/>the 18-teens he was one of the most respected composers in Europe, but<br/>spent years studying early music (i.e., Bach, Handel, and even<br/>Palestrina) in order to write the Missa Solemnis. He was innovative,<br/>but his innovations were grounded in a thorough understanding of and<br/>respect for the art form he had inherited.&quot;<br/>   Convinced...you&apos;re right on that one.  I&apos;m trying to remember...I had read somewhere that one of the major classical musicians (maybe it was Bach) was constantly losing jobs in Royal orchestras due to his affinity for a demonic lack of consonance in his work.  Can you recall any such musician?</p><p>&gt;&quot;Beethoven&apos;s<br/>music was controversial, but he actually had a successful career,<br/>considering that his main works were not designed to be<br/>&quot;audience-friendly&quot; (his &quot;Wellington&apos; s Victory&quot; symphony was designed<br/>to succeed, and indeed it became his most popular work in his lifetime).&quot;<br/>   Hmm...then maybe Beethoven was that &quot;heretic&quot; musician after all?  Bizarre (and quite interesting)...I&apos;m going to have to see if I can find a copy of &quot;Wellington&apos; s Victory&quot; to compare to his other work.</p><p>,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=88155 href="#88155">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 8:19:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Cox Franklin &lt;franklincox@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The mastery I mean is to know in a scientific way how music<br/>&gt; &gt; really functions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the obvious place to start is with scientific studies of<br/>&gt; how music functions, which I&apos;ve never seen you mention.</p><p>You (Gene) can certainly be forgiven for thinking Franklin wrote<br/>that, since it wasn&apos;t quoted, but in fact it was due to Marcel.</p><p>Folks: this list hasn&apos;t been particularly legible since yahoo<br/>hooked it up to the web over a decade ago.

My<br/>&gt; question is, why is it important?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;re talking about my tonality set I hope, not my harmonic model or<br/>&gt; direct permutations of the harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m talking about, in fact, all of the above. Why is the concept of<br/>&gt; permuting the harmonic series relevant musically? It seems to be an<br/>&gt; arbitrary mathematical operation and I don&apos;t get why it matters.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, I&apos;ll admit. A lot of my theory and thinking is based on &quot;belief&quot;<br/>assumptions.<br/>First of all, I belief music is JI.<br/>That tones have a rational vibration ratio between them.<br/>I do not belief so completely blind.<br/>The way I did it is I started with the assumption that music is JI, and then<br/>tried to disprove this.<br/>I found I couldn&apos;t.<br/>Even the seemingly impossible chord progressions have JI solutions (although<br/>dissonant) in them that I still prefer above a tempered version of such a<br/>progression.<br/>So I come to the semi-belief that music is JI.<br/>It mainly makes sense to me in the bigger picture.</p><p>I started out wishing to see all the posiblities JI gives, which is<br/>offcourse infinite.<br/>And then searching for a logical way to categorize these possiblities from<br/>simple to more complex.<br/>I then took the first assumption, that the harmonic series is perfect, and<br/>goes from simple to more complex the higher up the harmonics you go.<br/>But I had allready learned from studying actual musical chord progressions<br/>that high harmonics don&apos;t go nice when holding such a note and changing the<br/>chord.<br/>I looked at the harmonic series and looked at the intervals that make up the<br/>harmonic series.<br/>2/1, then 3/2, then 4/3, then 5/4, then 6/5.<br/>I played with these intervals, adding a lot of 3/2 on top of eachother<br/>sounds nice.<br/>Adding 5/4 on top of eachother doesn&apos;t sound nice.<br/>Somewhere among many silly ideas I got the idea of keeping the exact<br/>intervals of the harmonic series, not duplicating them, but only changing<br/>their order.<br/>So for instance 1/1 * 3/2 * 2/1 * 5/4 * 4/3, instead of 1/1 * 2/1 * 3/2 *<br/>4/3 * 5/4<br/>I really liked this as it allows me to categorize (limit) the result in<br/>several ways.<br/>It made sense to me as in musical chord progressions one first forms for<br/>instance a 4/3 with a note, then hold that note and another note then forms<br/>5/4 with it, and then 3/2, etc etc.<br/>I see this as a basis of how music works, something very similar to<br/>permutating.<br/>I then started playing with these permutations, in clumsy ways.<br/>I found a way to make a 12tone scale with them, got all excited, posted it<br/>here a year ago or so, then got on to other things but it stuck.<br/>And I found more and more logic in it.</p><p>Pff this is turning into a long story.<br/>I&apos;ve develop trust in it after a long time of experimentation, trying to<br/>prove it wrong, trying other things, finding logic in it etc.</p><p>Somewhere along the line I&apos;ve found logic in seeing things as connections of<br/>intervals, and as combinations of connections of intervals comming from a<br/>single point. (1/1)<br/>Somewhere I&apos;ve found logic in this way of doing things and it works with<br/>actual music.<br/>I realise now that I find it hard to write down this logic in a few easy<br/>sentences.<br/>But a lot of this logic is somewhat mathematical.<br/>For instance the I vi ii V I chord progression has only so many<br/>possiblities.<br/>My way of seeing it makes a lot of sense I think.</p><p>&gt; If so, then I HAVE explained this.<br/>&gt; &gt; But I&apos;ll explain it again.<br/>&gt; &gt; You have the harmonic model, based on permutations of the harmonic<br/>&gt; series.<br/>&gt; &gt; 6-limit (including all lower limits) will give 1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2<br/>&gt; 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1 (when reduced to one octave)<br/>&gt; &gt; All tones in this harmonic model have as their root (1/1 point) 1/1. And<br/>&gt; the permutations show that they really come from 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; Now my defenition of tonality is that one could play a continues drone<br/>&gt; (including upper harmonics as sounds have), and that everything played in<br/>&gt; this tonality must harmonize with this drone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) Define &quot;harmonize.&quot; So far the definition of that word seems to be<br/>&gt; &quot;sounds good to me,&quot; and your opinion of what intervals sound &quot;good&quot;<br/>&gt; vs &quot;bad&quot; changes with every message you post here.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well I can&apos;t really in an objective sense, not yet.<br/>But in my system it means beeing in a harmonic model.<br/>An harmonic model is a combination of all permutations (of a certain limit)<br/>comming from a single 1/1 root, combined.<br/>The permutations are &quot;consonant&quot;, the intervals formed in a combination of<br/>tones comming from different permutations are &quot;dissonant&quot;.</p><p>&gt; 2) When you say &quot;the permutations show that they really come from<br/>&gt; 1/1,&quot; you&apos;re saying that YOU have derived those intervals by applying<br/>&gt; an arbitrary mathematical operation to 1/1. They do not &quot;inherently&quot;<br/>&gt; come from 1/1, YOU derived them from 1/1.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, I did.<br/>Though in a beautifull way I think :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could come up with a few mathematical operations of my own and say<br/>&gt; the resulting tones &quot;come&quot; from 1/1 and all other tones are<br/>&gt; irrelevant. But the question is, why would I be right?<br/>&gt;</p><p>True,<br/>I think the ultimate judge is if it works, and this includes if it sounds<br/>right.</p><p>&gt; And harmony we understand according to the harmonic model.<br/>&gt; &gt; So we simply take the harmonic model, 6-limit in this case, and see where<br/>&gt; the 1/1 2/1 3/1 4/1 5/1 6/1 drone will harmonize.<br/>&gt; &gt; We then see that we can place the 1/1 root of the harmonic model at 1/1,<br/>&gt; and at 5/4, and at 4/3, and at 3/2, and at 5/3, and that everything played<br/>&gt; in those harmonic model roots will harmonize with the 1/1 drone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1&gt;  1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/4&gt;  1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; 4/3&gt;  1/1 16/15 10/9 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; 3/2&gt;  1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 27/20 45/32 3/2 27/16 9/5 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/3&gt;  1/1 25/24 10/9 5/4 4/3 25/18 3/2 25/16 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand here, why is 25/24 appearing under 5/4?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The 25/24 is appearing under 5/4 in the harmonic model root of 5/4 and 5/3.<br/>1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1  * 5/4 =<br/>1/1 25/24 9/8 75/64 5/4 45/32 3/2 25/16 5/3 15/8 2/1</p><p>1/1 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8 2/1  * 5/3 =<br/>1/1 25/24 10/9 5/4 4/3 25/18 3/2 25/16 5/3 15/8 2/1</p><p>So when the harmonic root is 5/4, then the 25/24 in the tonality scale is<br/>the 5/3 from 1/1 (hr 5/4).<br/>And when the harmonic root is 5/3 then the 25/24 in the tonality scale is<br/>the 5/4 from 1/1 (hr 5/3)</p><p>All in all after this time I&apos;ve spent with my theory it makes a lot of sense<br/>musically.<br/>Even though I find it&apos;s not easy to explain this here in a few sentences<br/>without asking you to go along with some assumptions and beliefs.<br/>And after this time, the way different parts in the theory come together,<br/>it&apos;s the most beautifull thing I&apos;ve seen, it&apos;s like magic.<br/>And it&apos;s also that it just works to see things this way.

I would add one: let&apos;s say that one has created a &quot;perfect&quot; scale system such that all intervals in it are beautiful and consonant. Someone will come along some day and bend those intervals in performance in order to increase their expressiveness. &nbsp; Out of this, new types of intervals will arise that are no longer in the system. In a closed society, one can enforce adherence to a perfect system, but in an open society, unruly human nature will assert itself. &nbsp;<br/>Some of the composers who did just what I described above include Josquin, Monteverdi, Bach, Rameau, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Wagner, Schoenberg, and so on.<br/>A good part of the expressive power of common-practice music actually lies in the interaction of consonance and dissonance, and a good part &nbsp;of the development of the common practice system grows out of the &nbsp;constant search for new, more expressively charged dissonances.<br/>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Mon, 4/26/10, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;

He also considered JI inartistic &gt;precisely because it used a natural rather than an artificial tuning &gt;system. &Acirc;&nbsp;He was rigorous about insisting that players perform with &gt;12 edo; I met a violist who had played for Schoenberg in a quartet, &gt;and he told me how much he hated having to play in 12 edo, how &gt;artificial it sounded. &Acirc;&nbsp;Which is interesting, and further confirms &gt;the evidence that I&apos;ve seen so far, which indicates that most string &gt;players were not consistently playing in 12 edo until later on in &gt;the century. &Acirc;&nbsp;They weren&apos;t playing in JI, either, but in any of a &gt;number of tuning approaches influenced by other players in their &gt;region, their teachers, etc.<br/>&gt; But Schoenberg was always open to further developments, and he &gt;would have been appalled by the dogmatism of many East Coast &gt;serialists who insisted that the 12 edo system comprised the total &gt;universe of pitch relationships. &Acirc;&nbsp;<br/>&gt; Was the book &quot;Schoenberg&apos;s Error&quot;? &Acirc;&nbsp;A real hatchet job.</p><p>Yes that was indeed precisely the book I was referring to, hahaha!</p><p>I wasn&apos;t aware that Schoenberg demanded strict 12-tET in performance, always wondered about that. Very interesting!</p><p>Of course there&apos;s a clash there with his explanation of the twelve tones being derived from harmonics, 11/8 and 13/8 (fis and as) are about a quartertone off of 12 and should disqualify that theory even for those for whom the syntonic comma does not.</p><p>Listening to pre-War records, and East Bloc records well after that, should convince entirely that strings (and everyone else with pitch performance flexibility) most certainly did not attempt to perform in strict 12-tET until quite recently. And it wasn&apos;t a matter of sloppiness, sloppiness creates quite the opposite effect of the homogenous sound character of older performances.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=88215 href="#88215">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2010 3:32:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mike&gt;&gt; So could this all be, in a way, yet another example of how the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;prime-limit&quot; way of measuring the consonance of scales is flawed?<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene&gt;&quot;Prime limit isn&apos;t a way of measuring consonance at all, &gt;which is part<br/>&gt; &gt; of the point I am making here. Anything above the two limit is &gt;dense in<br/>&gt; &gt; the positive reals, and so can get arbitrarily close to anything.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     Point proven!   I wonder then why there is so much stress on things like &quot;making scales 7-limit or less&quot;?   If it doesn&apos;t measure consonance well, what is it supposed to measure well?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What it measures well is the number of generators, unless you leave off some of the primes or temper things. There&apos;s a regularity in the structure of, for instance, 7-limit JI which can be applied to chord constuctions and relationships, and so forth. And the 5 and 7 limits have a nice geometrical picture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     Another thing...if Marcel&apos;s scales are in 6-prime-limit, what implications does that have on how its functionality can be proved (if any)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel isn&apos;t using as many primes as six, which would be the 13-limit. Nor is six a prime.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The actual complexity of an interval is context-dependent. 512/343 looks like a humdinger until it is put into the context of steps of 8/7 and judged against references within clearly audible spectra (where it clearly can function as a detuned 3/2 as well). Context and modality, selah.</p><p>Marcel&apos;s judgements and terminology make no sense outside of his personal prescriptions and proscriptions (in which they are actually well thought-out and consistent).</p></div>
