He too was concerned about the connotations of microtone, not only<br/>for music in scales such as 5,7,8,9,10, and 11-TET&apos;s, but also for<br/>systems such as 13, 14 ... where the step interval doesn&apos;t sound that<br/>much different to that of 12-tet.</p><p>From xenharmonic, one can derive xenharmonist and xenharmony. BTW, Ivor<br/>subtitled his Xenharmonic Bulletins &quot;xenharmonia&quot; in Greek followed by<br/>Greek numerals for each issue.</p><p>He proposed &quot;metachromatic&quot; for roughly 1/3 tone systems (Perrett used<br/>&quot;tierce-tone&quot; and Fokker &quot;tritotone,&quot; AKAIK). Metachromatic has another<br/>meaning in histology and molecular biology, but I doubt there would be<br/>much confusion in practice. He also used &quot;macrotonal&quot; for systems with<br/>less than 12 tones, but one might argue that,  strictly speaking, this<br/>should apply only to 5-tet and below.</p><p>Frankly, I use microtonal when speaking generally to non-microtonalists<br/>as xenharmonic and the other terms would be incomprehensible.</p><p>--John</p></div>
