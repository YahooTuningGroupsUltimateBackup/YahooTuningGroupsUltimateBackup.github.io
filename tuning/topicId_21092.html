Because the representation is continuously variable like the waveform of the original sound the analogue system follows the sound quite faithfully but it is subject to problems such as stretching or squashing of either the time axis (wow and flutter in a recording) or of the vertical axis (waveform distortion).</p><p>Digital equipment represents audio information using variables that can assume only separate discrete values which are usually very close together.  The sound is represented by a series of samples, for example a CD uses 44,100 samples per second each of which may be one of 65,536 different values (2^16).  Because the sound is being represented as discrete samples of step like sizes at fixed times it has a step like wave form which is then smoothed out by analogue electronics in the final output stage.  The highest frequency which can be represented is half the sampling rate, i.e. 22,500 hertz for a CD.   The maximum dynamic range in dB is 6 times the number of bits, i.e. 96 dB maximum for a CD.</p><p>&gt;I have heard time, after time, after time, after time that CD is inerior to<br/>&gt;vinyl, and I would like to be tested, formally on this with live analogue<br/>&gt;speakers, and digital equipment.</p><p>This is usually a complaint about the dynamic range.  Each bit in a digital system gives a doubling of possible output level which is a 6 dB increase.  Hence 16 bits gives a maximum theoretical dynamic range of 96Db.  But the dynamic range of a single acoustic guitar is said to be 110 dB, a full orchestra 120 dB and a rock band 140 dB in rough terms.  So the dynamic range of a CD is limited in a way that vinyl disk or FM radio is not.</p><p>I used to be amongst those who refused to buy a CD player for many years on the grounds that the dynamic range was too limited.  I once spoke to a man who worked for Linn Audio, a high quality equipment manufacturer in the UK and he said &apos; Oh, yes, the CD standard has ruined recorded music for an entire generation.&apos;  However, when I resort to vinyl disk listening these days I am mainly struck by the huge amounts of background noise and have come to tolerate CDs.</p><p>I am not sure what the audio standard for DVDs is.  Last time I heard it had not been finalized.</p><p>Hope this helps,<br/>Peter.</p></div><h3><a id=21197 href="#21197">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

Could be wrong about that.  16 bits is plenty if one<br/>is knowledgeable, skillful, and careful.  I don&apos;t know half a dozen people who are certain they can<br/>tell the difference.</p><p>Nice job answering that post, about analog/digital.  But S/N (signal to noise ratio) is the key to<br/>understanding practical dynamic range.  While it&apos;s true that an orchestra or live rock band can push<br/>the threshold of pain, it&apos;s important to recognize that the ambient noise in even an empty concert<br/>hall (I mean the audience seats are empty, not the stage, of course) is going to be at least 40 to 50<br/>dB.  More for a rock band.  Heck, a Marshall stack with a Strat plugged in is going to put out that<br/>much (at one meter) by itself with no notes being played.  Time all is said and done, you have<br/>considerably less than 96 dB of usable dynamic range.  Even if you somehow used the full 96, the<br/>typical listening environment is going to going to mask several dB of it once the volume is set to a<br/>tolerable listening level.  The only really significant advantage of 24 bit recording is that you can<br/>set your levels lower and not have to worry about &quot;overs.&quot;  The fact that it consumes 50% more system<br/>resources and disk space is not a worthy trade off for me.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
