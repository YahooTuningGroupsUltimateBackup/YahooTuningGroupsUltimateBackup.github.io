(is n&apos;t that a weird<br/>coincidence!) The multiphonis would vary  than what the outcome was and<br/>somtimes James would Greatly bring out even more notes!

By all means, though, you should<br/>get a hold of Johnny Reinhard&apos;s _Pitch_, volume 1 number 4, which has<br/>several sets of microtonal fingerings for all of the woodwind and for horn,<br/>of which I find Jon Fonville&apos;s especially useful. None of these, however,<br/>discusses the new possibilities of the Kyngsma flute, which is designed<br/>especially for quartertones.</p><p>Playing microtonally on a Boehme system flute built for 12tet is quite a<br/>bit like playing chromatically on a single keyed baroque flute. It&apos;s<br/>possible but at the price of evenness of color and volume (which I happen<br/>to consider to be an interesting compromise). The player, the keywork<br/>system and the individual flute and headpiece are all important variables.<br/>It is critical to sit down with the individual player and -- with the help<br/>of some of the reference materials above -- work out the part for your own<br/>work. A rehearsal tape with reference pitches is very useful. (David<br/>Feldman has used such a tape, with success, in a 7tet solo violin piece).</p><p>For these reasons, I think it is probably easier all around to compose the<br/>piece first and then figure out how finger it, making changes as necessary,<br/>rather than compose with the chart in hand. (Multiphonics and<br/>specifically-timbre&apos;d fingerings are a different subject).</p><p>Incidentally, for clarinet, the book by Philip Rehfeld is good and that of<br/>Peter Veale and Claus-Stefan Mahnkopf for oboe is very good. How long will<br/>we have to wait for Johnny Reinhard to write the great big microtonal<br/>bassoon and contrabassoon book?</p></div><h3><a id=1528 href="#1528">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/1999 4:00:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing microtonally on a Boehme system flute built for 12tet is quite a<br/>&gt; bit like playing chromatically on a single keyed baroque flute.

From<br/>study of Boehm&apos;s own book, &quot;Die Fl&#xFFFD;te und das Fl&#xFFFD;tenspiel&quot;, published in<br/>Munich in 1871, and all the subsequent works by players, physicists and<br/>other experts, the acoustic problem was far from the simple one it would<br/>seem to be.  The result is, of course, a compromise, as are all such<br/>designs, but is a very fortunate one in that the result is magnificent.<br/>The player can mechanically hit every note in the range of the instrument<br/>at will, and on the first try (assuming reasonable skill and practice), in<br/>very close approximation to the intended note; and can adjust the pitch<br/>easily by controlling the air stream.  For playing 12 tet music, it works<br/>very well.</p><p>&#x9; However, the myriad design compromises which facilitate playing in 12 tet<br/>work against playing other notes.  In designing his quarter-tone and 31-tet<br/>fingering charts, Thomas Howell warned about this.  On Page 52, where he<br/>introduces the 31-tone fingerings, he says that &quot;a certain degree of<br/>humoring with the embouchure is needed to bring the pitches into<br/>temperament . . .&quot;.  I find that to be true, in Spades!  The un-adjusted<br/>notes produced are very unevenly spaced; e. g., between a1 and b-flat1 are<br/>two fingerings.  Without adjustment, these sound very nearly alike; to get<br/>them spaced properly, the player needs to know what he&apos;s trying for.  And<br/>this is the problem, all the way up the scale.</p><p>&#x9;Karl-Heinz Stockhausen showed the way in a concert titled &quot;Sirius&quot;, which<br/>we heard in Houston in January 1978.  He had four performers: a vocalist, a<br/>trumpeter, a bass player and a bass clarinetist.  Each wore a single<br/>earphone, which was tied into a console operated by Stockhausen, which<br/>played the sounds each player was supposed to reproduce; the player then<br/>knew what he was to do, and did it very well.  As I recall, he used many<br/>different scales, but mostly 25 tones in two octaves.</p><p>&#x9;It appears to me that some such arrangement is necessary for such<br/>performance.  A musician has to be able to tell when he is making the right<br/>sounds; and except for the usual 12-note scale, it just isn&apos;t obvious.<br/>This, I think, dominates the problem, regardless of the particular<br/>fingerings used.</p><p>From Alita:</p><p>My comments about the 24 tet and 31 tet fingering charts:</p><p>&#x9;Without sound to compare results I can&apos;t be sure I am accurately blowing<br/>the pitch.  I need a comparative pitch tape to be sure I have the correct<br/>pitch.  Flutes and other woodwinds can be easily &quot;lipped&quot; sharp or flat.<br/>Since we hear almost only 12 tet it is impossible to learn other than 12<br/>tet or whatever tuning is used by unaccompanied musicians and singers.<br/>(The old argument that we play or sing just or meantone or whatever when<br/>not accompanied by a fixed pitch instrument as guitar or piano.)</p><p>&#x9;These new fingerings are fun to try.  We have had the book &quot;The Avant<br/>Garde Flute&quot; since about 1976 (soon after it came out) and I have opened it<br/>to try the notes from time to time.  The fingerings are new and need to be<br/>learned almost as if learning to play a &quot;new&quot; instrument.  I need a<br/>fingering chart below each note change and play a &lt;slow&gt; waltz or march for<br/>a while until learned.  Our flute doesn&apos;t have a low B foot which is needed<br/>for some notes.</p><p>----------<br/>&gt; From: Bill Alves &lt;<a href="mailto:alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu">alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Flute fingerings<br/>&gt; Date: Wednesday, March 10, 1999 12:16 PM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu">alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu</a> (Bill Alves)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a book by Thomas Howell -- The Avant-Garde Flute: A Handbook for<br/>&gt; Composers and Flutists / University of California Press, 1974 -- that has<br/>&gt; fingering charts for 31-tone and 24-tone scales.
