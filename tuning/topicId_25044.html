I do find it interesting as an indication of the importance of tuning<br/>(in some form or another) that whenever someone shows me their piano they<br/>almost always say, &quot;Ah, but it does need to be tuned.&quot;</p><p>But my &apos;ear&apos; has become ten times better from tuning experiments than from<br/>all the years in sight singing classes:)</p><p>Thank you for the information about the Festival.

It<br/>is a Guitar Concerto.  The string players move to rhythms they likely never<br/>play, all following conductor Nathan Fuhr.  It seemed that everything was<br/>seamless, and finished at just under an hour.  Due to recording commitments,<br/>I had to miss Rod Poole&apos;s segment.</p><p>Jon&apos;s virtuosity on his special guitar is legendary.  I could have wished for<br/>my lines that might be set up between him and his performers.  But this is<br/>minimalism and it has its own aesthetic (and I am eclectic).  Still, every so<br/>often the audience was rewarded with some truly beautiful licks and segments.<br/> Still too much vibrato for my taste, but after working on this piece for 2<br/>years already, it is well-seasoned and ready for a CD.</p><p>Especially evocative were  short, emotionalisms achieved through slow gliss<br/>from microtone to microtone.  Very human, and exploring an area of sound that<br/>few ever visit, yet feel inside them every waking day.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2001 5:05:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry I didn&apos;t get around to this sooner but between the festival,<br/>my business and my dad in and out of the hospital, I didn&apos;t get<br/>around to commenting on this.</p><p>Minimalism - Evolution is not minimalism although there were moments.<br/>Now...Blurry Day is quite minimal, I take a 1/2 hour to introduce the first 6<br/>notes. La Monte Youngs Composition 1960, #7 is true minimalism, B &amp; F#<br/>sustained for a very long time.</p><p>Evolution is not only ready as a CD, it has already been released<br/>as a limited edition CD. Try <a href="http://microtones.com">http://microtones.com</a></p><p>As for your comments about inserting your own lines into the piece,<br/>this reminds my of the story about how a rock guitar player came up<br/>to Phillip Glass and told him how he wanted to jam with the band.</p><p>I like Evolution more every time I hear it. And last nights introduction<br/>of Jon&apos;s new band Swallow embraces the blues of the Mississippi<br/>Delta and Hill Country plus the hard blues rock of bands like Cream<br/>and Led Zeppelin. Swallow sounds like a classic blues rock band<br/>that&apos;s tuned in 13 limit Just Intonation.<br/>Swallow is so hot, you could fry steak &apos;n&apos; eggs on it.</p><p>db<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a></p><p>  Jon&apos;s virtuosity on his special guitar is legendary.
