The Pythagorean or meantone diatonic scale has two<br/>identical tetrachords in every octave span, making melodic motion<br/>exceptionally comprehensible and flexible at the same time.

Notice<br/>how the basic scale in India, in 5-limit JI, is tuned with two identical<br/>tetrachords between the tonic and the octave above.

Perhaps either is<br/>equally valid, but the fact is that most music in the West so far was<br/>written with the former aesthetic effect intended is important for those of<br/>us who place ourselves within that tradition.</p><p>&gt;a) The tonic drifts.
