Some modern pedal steels<br/>have what we call &quot;tunable splits&quot;.  This means that if you double sharp a<br/>string with one pedal and flat it with another at the same time, you can<br/>tune the resulting note independent of each of the pedals separately.</p><p>A common use for tunable splits is on the middle B string of the E9th<br/>tuning.  We have a pedal that raises the B (3/2) to C# (5/3), and a knee<br/>lever that lowers the same string to A# (45/32).  When we use them together<br/>we can use the split tuner to tune a C note.  The puzzle is, how should we<br/>tune it?</p><p>I think that most players want to use it to get an augmented chord (E, G#,<br/>C, E, G#).  Assuming that the E&apos;s are 1/1 and 2/1 and the G#&apos;s are 5/4 and<br/>5/2, is there any tuning for the C (more correctly called B#, I think) that<br/>creates a beatless chord?</p><p>Another possible triad would use the E&apos;s (1/1 and 2/1), the middle G (6/5)<br/>and the newly tunable C for a C major chord.  Here the C would clearly be<br/>tuned to 8/5.  Would tuning the C to 8/5 be incompatible with its use in an<br/>augmented chord as described above?  I guess what I&apos;m really asking is how<br/>do 5/4 and 8/5 sound together?  That interval doesn&apos;t seem to be anywhere<br/>near a whole number ratio.</p><p>Is there any JI interval that would work for both of these contexts?</p><p>    -b0b-</p></div><h3>Paul H.

But in the augmented triad, any two<br/>of the three intervals can be tuned to pure 5:4 or 8:5, and then the third<br/>interval will be rather dissonant. The worst place to put that dissonant<br/>interval is between the two lowest notes. So tuning the C to 8/5 is not too<br/>bad, and gives you that nice C major. But the most consonant tuning for the<br/>augmented triad is something near equal temperament.</p></div><h3>Bob Lee &#x3C;quasar@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/1999 10:25:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>corrected, I wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;Steel guitarists are aware that certain chord positions cannot be played<br/>&gt;&gt;accurately at the fret.
