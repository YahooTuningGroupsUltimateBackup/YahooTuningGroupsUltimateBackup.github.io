<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>AW.: PC appeal.</h1><h3>DWolf77309@xx.xxx</h3><span>8/20/1999 1:29:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have to disagree with this appeal. Over the years, I&apos;ve encountered list<br/>members with every sort of Mac, every version of DOS or Windows, at least one<br/>Amiga and one Atari, quite a few Unixers, and a growing number of Linux or<br/>BeOS users. Although software is sometimes discussed, the concerns of this<br/>list are largely platform-independent, if not computer-independent; indeed,<br/>many of us still work primarily with pencil and paper!  In any case, this<br/>platform variety is a real part of this list&apos;s character.</p><p>I agree heartily that computers are wonderful tools . Calculations, graphics,<br/>and tables are all easy to make, and the ability to synthesize .WAV files in<br/>my home studio has profoundly changed the way in which I work, although my<br/>finished scores are still intended to be read by instrumentalists and<br/>singers. While I&apos;m not yet satisfied with the Internet as a vehicle for<br/>transmitting recordings of music, it is an excellent way to transmit news,<br/>theoretical writings, technical information etc., most of that encodable in<br/>plain ASCII.  Isn&apos;t that already a large enough task for this list?</p><p>There is also a political argument to add here.  The pressure to constantly<br/>upgrade comes at a high real cost to most users.  The newer platform or<br/>operating system or program may include a lot of attractive new features, but<br/>they are seldom made with any real sense of economy other than the desire to<br/>convince consumers that their existing system is out of date.  I still drive<br/>my Rayna box with an Atari ST without a harddrive, getting sophisticated,<br/>musical sounds with an operating system that fits on a single floppy, while<br/>Windows 98 is eating up the better part of a gigabyte on my PC.</p><p>Some of my favorite electronic music was composed with a minimum of resources<br/>-- Richard Maxfield&apos;s _Night Music_ used only a tape recorder and a high<br/>frequency oscillator and some Latin American composers have used simple<br/>bamboo instruments to simulate synthesized sounds. The whole Early Music<br/>movement has also demonstrated that advances in technology do not necessarily<br/>bring improvements in music, but rather that particular technologies may<br/>often be more appropriate to a given music.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3>Zhang2323@xxx.xxx</h3><span>8/20/1999 7:19:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 8/20/99 5:30:01 PM, you wrote:</p><p>&gt;... advances in technology do not necessarily<br/>&gt;bring improvements in music, but rather that particular technologies may<br/>&gt;often be more appropriate to a given music.</p><p>    WHOLE-HEARTED AGREEMENT from me...<br/>    there is such thing as &quot;Appropriate Technologies&quot;<br/>    ... ties in with the whole &quot;Small is Beautiful&quot;<br/>    ethics/ aesthetics.</p><p>    For example, the only reasons why I seek a synthesizer that is<br/>    capable of non12TET scales:</p><p>    1) to be able to play many different sounds that<br/>        do not exist or are unwieldy to cart around or<br/>        to expensive for me to make or have made</p><p>    2) to create wide variety of UNEQUAL Just Intonation<br/>        scales &amp; to be able to experiment with same w/o<br/>        too much &quot;techno-obsessive compulsiveness&quot; or<br/>        &quot;techno-consumerism.&quot;</p></div>
