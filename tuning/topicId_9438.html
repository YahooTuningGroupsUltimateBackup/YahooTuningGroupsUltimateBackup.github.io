His performances<br/>practically verge on a jazz concept, since Ives feels perfectly free to<br/>change things each time around... he was pretty much opposed to a fixed<br/>concept.  Of course, it was the COMPOSER improvising, not anybody else,<br/>and composing as he went along...</p><p>Also commentary by James Sinclair of the Ives Society and comments by<br/>Emerson Concerto authority and Ives musicologist David Gray Porter...</p><p>The CD is in the record stores in New York, but in case you can&apos;t get it<br/>in your area:</p><p>Composers Recordings Inc.<br/>73 Spring Street, Suite 506<br/>New York, NY 10012<br/>212-941-9673<br/><a href="http://www.composersrecordings.com">www.composersrecordings.com</a></p><p>_________ ____ __ _ _</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
