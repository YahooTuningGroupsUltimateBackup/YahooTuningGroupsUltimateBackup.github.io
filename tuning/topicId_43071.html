I&apos;m interested in getting a<br/>better tuner to help in my instrument construction and hence, my self<br/>education in JI. I&apos;m looking at the Peterson Vs-1 virtual strobe<br/>elctronic tuner. Any opinions? The thing that caught my eye was the<br/>precision possible and the preprogramed JI and alternate tunings. The<br/>cost is a little higher than I&apos;d like, but a lot cheaper than anything<br/>else I&apos;ve seen that is as accurate. Strangely, most of the on line<br/>reviews have been either glowing or rather dissappointed, especially<br/>with the durability of the case, switches, etc. Anyone have one of<br/>these?<br/>Thanks<br/>Peace,<br/>Chester</p><p>vv</p></div><h3>Walter Lepore &#x3C;earth7@optonline.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2003 12:28:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Probably not what your looking for but you may find this of interest.</p><p>Please see...  <a href="http://www.justonic.com/default3.htm">http://www.justonic.com/default3.htm</a></p></div><h3>jcklizas &#x3C;jcklizas@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2003 12:59:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;coitmusic&quot; &lt;cwinowiecki@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;I&apos;m looking at the Peterson Vs-1 virtual strobe<br/>&gt; elctronic tuner.

It has a richer feature set<br/>then the VS-1, i.e. you can store custom tunings, the preprogrammed<br/>temperaments can start on any pitch (The VS-1 is limited to C) and it<br/>contains a metronome. The only reason I know any of this is that I,<br/>like you, am researching a portable tuner to purchase.<br/>Here are some of the blurbs from Peterson&apos;s web site<br/>(<a href="http://www.petersontuners.com/products/modelvsam/index.cfm">http://www.petersontuners.com/products/modelvsam/index.cfm</a>):</p><p>Strobe Tuner, Tone Generator and Metronome modes<br/>Adjustable to all keys, tonal roots and temperaments<br/>Savable settings such as temperament, key, metronome and default<br/>settings<br/>Concert A Reference of 410 to 490Hz</p><p>Searching the Internet turns up prices in the range of $250 although<br/>I don&apos;t know if anyone actually has the units in stock yet.</p><p>Pricey but attractive.</p><p>Jonathan Klizas<br/><a href="mailto:jcklizas@yahoo.com">jcklizas@yahoo.com</a></p></div>
