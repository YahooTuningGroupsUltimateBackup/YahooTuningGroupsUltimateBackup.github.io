My name is Jessica and I am doing a science/math project. I am study<br/>&gt;how different chemicals applied to clarinet reeds affect the intonation of<br/>&gt;notes. I was searching on the net for some information about intonation,<br/>&gt;where I happened to come across your website. It had a lot of information<br/>&gt;that was interesting, but only a little amount that was applicable to my<br/>&gt;project. In my experiment, I used 4 size 3 V12 Vandoren Bb clarinet reeds. I<br/>&gt;played a Concert Bb with all 4 of the reeds and recorded the intonation off<br/>&gt;of my automatic chromatic tuner set on 440 as the pitch. I soaked a reed in<br/>&gt;orange juice, another in vinegar, the 3rd in vegetable oil, and the last in<br/>&gt;sugar water. I allowed them to be immersed for 5 minutes. I took them out<br/>&gt;and let them dry, and then I played the Concert Bb again. I took the initial<br/>&gt;and final readings and compared the change. The results were that the<br/>&gt;vinegar affected the reed the most. I&apos;m not sure if this is part of your<br/>&gt;expertise, for this project is kinda &quot;different&quot;, however, i was wondering<br/>&gt;if you could tell me what causes the intonation fluctuations with the added<br/>&gt;substances and if there is a more accurate way of calculating the intonation<br/>&gt;changes besides subtracting the initial and final readings off of the tuner.<br/>&gt;If and when you have time, i would greatly appreciate your reply. Thank you<br/>&gt;very much. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sincerely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Jessica<br/>&gt;11th grade student<br/>&gt;Lyman High School<br/>&gt;Longwood, FL</p><p>I&apos;m not much of a reed player myself, but I would imagine that if soaking<br/>the reed in different liquids caused intonational changes, they&apos;d just be<br/>compensated for in practice by adjusting the length of the &quot;tuning barrel&quot;<br/>(or whatever it&apos;s called, we trombonists call it a tuning slide).</p><p>I presume that as you&apos;re changing reeds in your experiment, you&apos;re being<br/>careful to put the mouthpiece/barrel back on in the same tuning position<br/>(perhaps fully closed/shortened).  I guess a thicker reed might cause the<br/>clarinet to appear slightly shorter, resulting in a slightly higher pitch.<br/>So if soaking the reed made it thicker, maybe you&apos;d get a higher note.</p><p>Your experiment may also result in changes in &quot;timbre&quot;, maybe causing less<br/>of a &quot;clarinetty&quot; sound.  But your tuner won&apos;t help you measure that.<br/>Clarinets are almost the only instrument whose &quot;frequency spectrum&quot; has<br/>only odd harmonics (it skips the even harmonics because the tube is closed<br/>at one end).  This give clarinets that &quot;oo&quot; sound (as in mOOn).</p><p>Regarding your method of calculating the intonation changes, it would make<br/>more sense to divide your readings instead of subtracting them, since pitch<br/>is geometric rather than arithmetic.  For example, to go up an octave, you<br/>double the frequency.  &quot;Cents&quot; are commonly used as a unit of measurement<br/>for intervals; 1200 cents = 1 octave.</p><p>Anyway, perhaps some of the tuning list folk can better assist you.  Many<br/>of them are performers, some of them are instrument builders.  And your<br/>topic sounds relevant to expermental musical instrument design.</p><p>Good luck (and happy T-day)!<br/>--Mark (<a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>, AKA <a href="mailto:tuning-owner@onelist.com">tuning-owner@onelist.com</a>)</p><p>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;   |<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>__________________________________________<br/>NetZero - Defenders of the Free World<br/>Get your FREE Internet Access and Email at<br/><a href="http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html">http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html</a></p></div>
