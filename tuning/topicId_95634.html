So<br/>you can think of this as the ultimate JI chord, made of sines, all at equal<br/>volume.</p><p>Then, they play then an impulse train in which every other impulse is<br/>flipped upside down, like this:</p><p>|___ ___|___<br/>    |</p><p>This has only odd-numbered harmonics from 1 to infinity. Also, if you&apos;ve<br/>noticed, the period has now been cut in half. So the &quot;difference tones&quot;<br/>remain the same between each frequency, but the period has been halved.</p><p>The file then goes back to the old impulse train waveform...</p><p>|___|___|___</p><p>And finally goes to a different version of the impulse train in which the<br/>period remains the same, but an upside down impulse is inserted between each<br/>impulse:</p><p>|_ _|_ _|_ _|_<br/>  |   |   |</p><p>The file then repeats itself.</p><p>The aim is to see between which two waveforms the periodicity buzz remains<br/>constant: the waveforms that have the same period, or the waveforms that<br/>have the same frequency differences? It seems to me that the buzz remains<br/>constant between the first, second, and third waveforms (same as first), and<br/>then the fourth one buzzes twice as fast. So it would appear to have more to<br/>do with frequency differences than waveform period, which makes sense from<br/>the gammatone filter plot from before.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=95635 href="#95635">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2011 12:53:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>One last test: I also wanted to test the hypothesis that periodicity<br/>buzz had something to do with the brain summing the signal and then<br/>performing some sort of time-domain analysis. So for this test, I took<br/>an impulse train and played it binaurally, but with the two ears<br/>aligned such that the signal, if summed, should be transposed up an<br/>octave. Here&apos;s a plot of what I&apos;m talking about:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/staggeredtrains.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/staggeredtrains.png</a></p><p>The top graph is the signal being played into the left ear, the middle<br/>is the signal being played into the right ear, and the bottom is the<br/>resultant signal that should come out if the two are summed. Note that<br/>the bottom one is the same as the other ones, but transposed up an<br/>octave.</p><p>I end up playing the left signal into the left ear, and the right<br/>signal into the right ear, such that we have stereo decorrelation<br/>between the two signals. If periodicity buzz is somehow rooted in a<br/>temporal process taking place in the brain, and not in the cochlea,<br/>then when the binaural signal is present, the buzz should sound twice<br/>as fast as when either signal is played alone.</p><p>Here&apos;s the example:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/staggeredtrains.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/staggeredtrains.wav</a></p><p>First you get the left ear alone (pay attention to the speed of the<br/>buzz), then the right ear alone, then the binaural signal (buzz<br/>doesn&apos;t sound like it speeds up to me), then the signal you WOULD have<br/>gotten if a summation were involved (now the buzz speeds up).</p><p>In other words, for the binaural signal, the buzz between the two ears<br/>is perfectly out of phase with one another, such that between each<br/>particle of buzz in one ear lies a particle of buzz in the other ear.<br/>The brain doesn&apos;t seem to be able to put this together to hear buzz<br/>twice as fast, thus buzz must be taking place before any summation<br/>occurs, if a summation occurs at all.</p><p>Renditions of both of these examples that involve chords like 5:6:7<br/>and such will follow, for those skeptics out there who are still<br/>holding out that the buzz in these examples isn&apos;t &quot;true&quot; periodicity<br/>buzz, although they&apos;re going to be more difficult to work out.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Tue, Jan 18, 2011 at 3:43 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I ran the impulse train test I described at the bottom of this thread, to see if the differences between frequencies, or the VF is the more important factor in creating periodicity buzz:</p></div><h3><a id=98594 href="#98594">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2011 12:33:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here are the results:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzvfvsdiff344.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzvfvsdiff344.wav</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzvfvsdiff172.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzvfvsdiff172.wav</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzvfvsdiff86.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzvfvsdiff86.wav</a></p><p>You haven&apos;t established that these files contain periodicity<br/>buzz.

So if<br/>&gt; &gt; I generate an odd-harmonic buzz waveform, and the buzz sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; twice as fast, then that means the difference tones are what&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; being heard, not the VF.</p><p>Carl wrote:<br/>&gt; Ok, I&apos;m down.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
