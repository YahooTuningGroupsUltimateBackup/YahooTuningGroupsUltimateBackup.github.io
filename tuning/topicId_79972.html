At the moment the conic bells are sounding just perfect to me with a strong minor third component ( around 1507 c) and a stretched octave of around 2470 cents which sounds flat (and obscure) when adjusted to 2400 c. There is a lot of work involved on creating a solid steel mandrel, so the 2 mm steel sheet can be spun on a lathe in several stages (to get thickness even all across the bell). I would also imagine that whatever I can simulate with &apos;Spear&apos; to change the components of the spectrum so I can get a more attractive tone, it might not be that attractive when the a bell designed to favour those partials is created. I would imagine some partials are related and you cannot simply change the shape of the bell to favour on single partial but a combination of them.</p><p>I know the people doing the Australian bell have done a lot of work on this but they have the bugs to cast, test, cast, test ... oh well I guess I could practice casting my japanese temple bells! haha!</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated!</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>Tony Salinas</p><p>On 2009/01/15, at 16:56, Charles Lucy wrote:</p><p>&gt; Are you planning to make observations. i.e. by<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a) recording each bell and processing the audio to reveal the &gt; spectrum, or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; b) is this to be just a theoretical (calculated) exercise?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a) I suggest Spear or a more sophisticated Spectrum analysis &gt; application.
