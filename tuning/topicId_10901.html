These physicists then ponder the<br/>inter-relationships between<br/>mulitple spheres of influence. I suppose some complicated<br/>mathematics can be<br/>used to depict this interactivity. Does anyone here see any<br/>relevance of<br/>these things to justly tuned logic?</p><p>&gt; &gt; PS. I like having an online archive at egroups for this (and<br/>&gt; &gt; other) lists; I can delete<br/>&gt; &gt; un- or half-read messages, and still have them available to<br/>&gt; &gt; research at a time appropriate<br/>&gt; &gt; for me. Why re-invent the archive-wheel?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the archive is nice, but i wish i could search for a string in<br/>&gt; the bodies of posts as well as in the subjects -- am i just<br/>&gt; missing something obvious?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Paul, I think you can search the bodies of posts. I just did it<br/>successfully.<br/>Try opening the Messages page and doing a search.
