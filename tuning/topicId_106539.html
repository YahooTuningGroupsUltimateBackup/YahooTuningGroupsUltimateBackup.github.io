The last one had two problems, 1. I made a mistake (sorry, but I always do),  2. The violin strings<br/> drifted, cannot maintain the tuning through the duration of the piece. I have to neglect the upper two<br/> strings and just mind arriving at the interval in the end. The interval in the double stop is as I first<br/> worked out to be,  9/8 * 9/8 * 81/40 (x 293.66 Hz = 752.63 Hz. The strings may have drifted, though.<br/> <a href="https://youtu.be/4G5WNdXMOvM">https://youtu.be/4G5WNdXMOvM</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/4G5WNdXMOvM">https://youtu.be/4G5WNdXMOvM</a></p><p> I will later make another video to demo how &quot;Pure&quot; intervals are not more pure than the &quot;Quantise&quot; ones</p><p> Mendelssohn violin piece played with violin tuned (Hz):<br/> E : 669.00; A : 446.00; D : 293.66; G : 195.778<br/> While some violinists tune up their G-strings in a concert, I am doing the exact opposite. The &quot;standard&quot; violin tuning (exact 3/2 P5&apos;s) is E 660, A 440, D 293.33, G 195.56. Each string down is 1.96 cent against the &quot;ET&quot; scale. Violinists do this to compensate for the 1.96 x 2 cent error against a supposedly 2:1 ocatve, ET piano.<br/> In the 80&apos;s I proposed the 81:40, 1,221.5 cent octave which I named &quot;Stretch Octave&quot;. It has subsequently been proven scientifically (1) that the music octave as perceived by the listener is about 1220 cent.<br/> Here I postulate the reason why the octave is 1,221.5 cent :  consider the whole tone as 9:8 (as the &quot;Pythagoras Scale&quot;). Stack six of these together, and it makes 1,223 cents - complies with the finds of the scientists (about 20 cents bigger than the 2:1 octave). Apparently, the ear likes to construct the octave according to the size of this 9:8 interval.<br/> I therefore call this tuning system &quot;Quasi-Equal&quot; (or &quot;Pseudo-Equal&quot;).<br/> Re &quot;Quantum&quot; intonation&quot; - in contrast to &quot;Pure&quot; intonation. I noticed that the ear is actually also sensitive to complication ratios, contrast to the old belief that ratios need to be &quot;simple&quot;. Therefore ratios which are &quot;relevant&quot; in music are just numerous. This recording is a example to illustrate this &quot;fact&quot;.<br/> &quot;Stretched&quot; music &quot;needs&quot; an &quot;ET&quot; accompaniment. Instead of contradiction, the &quot;Stretch&quot; scale consists the 4/3 tetrachord, which agrees with ET (with small error). Because of the small size of the &quot;half-tone&quot;, the lower note in the &quot;half-tone&quot; step sounds a tiny &quot;sharp&quot;, the upper one a little &quot;flat&quot;. This is how the &quot;sensation&quot; in music comes about, or how the &quot;leading note&quot; gets &quot;resolved&quot;.<br/> In the very last double stop of this piece are the two notes, F# on high position, against an open D (presently, 293.66), a horrifying endeavour, theoretically impossible to be in tune. The old school says the &quot;Pure&quot; F# is 734.16 Hz (under a 446A, 293.66 x 5 / 2), otherwise, 740 Hz in ET. Recording here plays F# at a not-so-simple ratio of  9/8 * 9/8 * 81/40 (x 293.66 Hz = 752.63 Hz). Notice in particular, the double stop immediately prior plays this same F# with the D a &quot;Stretched Octave&quot; higher than the open D (interval = 9/8 * 9/8),  Both these intervals sound &quot;pure&quot;.  The postulate is, any interval any multiples of the syntonic comma, 81/80, sounds pure or significant. In short, any interval which sounds in tune are, by default, significant. Hence this name &quot;Quantum&quot;.<br/> The note D tuned at 193.66 is an attempt to render this last note same as the D on the ET,440 piano. A at 446 adapts the tuning to the &quot;Stretched&quot; environment.<br/> (1) OCTAVE DISCRIMINATION: TEMPORAL AND CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS Lola L. Cuddy and Peter A.
