It won&apos;t<br/>sound like chipmunks because the original frequencies are all very low<br/>and the speeding up is required to bring it into human hearing range.&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Oh dear!!!!!</p><p>We&apos;re at cross purposes!!!!</p><p>I meant &quot;harmonic quality&quot; in a sence of &quot;VARIETY&quot;, and differences making the<br/>music sound INTERESTING!!!!!!!</p><p>Sure, the RELATIVE HARMONICS are the same, but I&apos;d define this<br/>as &quot;harmonic quality loss&quot;.</p><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding!</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;Obviously the action is over in a fraction of the time if it is sped up<br/>and so a decently long recording is required before it is sped up (but<br/>this can be done at 1000 samples per second or less if you want.&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>How true, how true!!!</p><p>---I will be in touch,</p><p>Sarn.</p></div>
