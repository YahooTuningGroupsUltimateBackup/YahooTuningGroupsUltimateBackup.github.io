Make sense?</p><p>This seems like a chicken-and-egg sort of thing to me. Correct me if i<br/>don&apos;t understand this right, but your scheme would place more importance in<br/>tuning the highest &quot;limit&quot; presented in a system, whereas the other<br/>emphasizes the lowest &quot;limit&quot; represented.

But then again, if<br/>the most &quot;familiar&quot; intervals (lowest ones) are off, then there&apos;s no hope<br/>in getting any sense out of a piece of music. So there has to be a balance<br/>somehow. It seems the attainment of this very balance has been the goal of<br/>theorists for a while now... So each scheme pulls towards the higher/lower<br/>&quot;limits&quot; to be approximated. To achieve a balance, perhaps you can somehow<br/>(and here i show my artist&apos;s badge, not that of a theorist!) merge the two<br/>? SOMEHOW ? Otherwise it seems we&apos;re just going in circles...<br/>but it&apos;s a fun circle nonetheless.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Mann&apos;s book (Analytic Study of Harmonic Intervals), after all the<br/>series and mediants are calculated, falls back on experimental results where<br/>for all consonant intervals, less than 20 cents mistuning was generally<br/>tolerated, and 30 cents mistuning considered quite unacceptable. Using<br/>equal-weighted RMS, I find, for example, that the 7-limit is approximated<br/>better and better by the following sequence of equal temperaments, in which<br/>no additional ETs can be inserted: 9, 10, 12, 15, 19, 22, 27, 31=62, 68, 72.<br/>I also found that the optimal meantone temperament has a perfect fifth of<br/>2-2*log(3)+7*log(5) steps in 26-tone equal temperament, where the logs are<br/>in base 2. I posted the derivation of that some time ago. That&apos;s 696.1648<br/>cents. I just discovered that that&apos;s 7/26-comma meantone temperament! I wish<br/>I had realized that before, so I could have mentioned it in my paper.</p><p>Proof: An untempered perfect fifth would be 26*log(3)-26 steps in 26-tone<br/>equal temperament. A comma would be 26*4*log(3)-26*log(5)-4*26 steps. 7/26<br/>of that is 28*log(3)-7*log(5)-28 steps. Subtract that from 26*log(3)-26 and<br/>you get 2-2*log(3)+7*log(5) steps.</p><p>So, between this and the derivation I posted a while back, we have proved<br/>that the meantone tuning with the smallest equal-weighted RMS error in the<br/>three 5-limit intervals is 7/26-comma meantone temperament.</p><p>Using maximum error instead of RMS error, 1/4-comma meantone is best when<br/>equal-weighting is used. But maximum error ignores the second-worst error<br/>and third-worst error, so I prefer RMS.</p><p>P.S. RMS is root-mean-square, the standard statistical measure of error. It<br/>is the square root of the mean of the squares of the errors of the<br/>individual intervals (in this case, the perfect fifth, major third, and<br/>minor third).</p></div><h3>prometheus &#x3C;cypriot@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/1999 4:50:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;Paul H.
