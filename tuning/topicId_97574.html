I&apos;ll check them both out.<br/>In the meantime, I recommend that folks check out the porcupine setup<br/>I have going - just make the short axis be the large step, and the<br/>large axis be the small step. This way, porcupine[7] is one step up<br/>and then 7 more to the right.</p><p>If you do this in 15-tet, then two columns along the short axis gives<br/>you blackwood, which is an extra perk. But you should do it in 22-tet<br/>to be safe though.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
