Musicologists have<br/>&gt;     been failing music and the people making music for a very long time.<br/>&gt;     There are so many examples to name. However, there are plenty of<br/>&gt;     other fields that have been as bad, or worse.<br/>&gt; &gt;     That said, the real scandal is not Bradley&apos;s attempt to get legs for<br/>&gt;     his autochtonous deduction(s), but that an &quot;august&quot; body deigned to<br/>&gt;     print them...in England.<br/>&gt; &gt;     A thank you to Ibo Ortgies for leading a charge, though damage has<br/>&gt;     already been done. There were so many holes in Lehman&apos;s assertions<br/>&gt;     that one must wonder &quot;why&quot; it was published, and under peer review!</p><p>&quot;Damage has been done...&quot;--er, what &quot;damage&quot; is there in inducing musicians and musicologists to think, to experiment, and to re-study the material closely?</p><p>&quot;Holes in Lehman&apos;s assertions...&quot;--I happen to disagree that the straw-man points brought up by Lindley/Ortgies are such holes in my work.  Their article in its italic/roman format is an attempt to guess my argument&apos;s premises (on the way to knocking them down), and in some cases they&apos;re way off with their guesses.  Are you simply taking their word for it?</p><p>My premises are here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/history.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/history.html</a><br/>and have been since May 31 2006.  There shouldn&apos;t be any great excuse for misunderstanding those, unless one *prefers* straw-man arguments against my work!</p><p>My own specific remarks about the new Lindley/Ortgies article are at<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/lindleyortgies.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/lindleyortgies.html</a><br/>I continue to add sections to that page every few days, so keep checking back....</p><p>My other two articles continue to be available, too, for anyone interested to read my follow-ups after the Oxford piece.<br/>Autumn 2005 here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/clavichord.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/clavichord.html</a><br/>Spring 2006 here:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/art.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/art.html</a></p><p>And, the Oxford one itself, including its seven files that are all part of it:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html</a></p><p>Bradley Lehman<br/><a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a></p></div>
