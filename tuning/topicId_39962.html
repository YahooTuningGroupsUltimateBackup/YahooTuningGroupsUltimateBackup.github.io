I had a thought: next time someone has a killer addition for the dictionary</p><p>- get a web page tool (I can recommend free ones)<br/>- take a sample of one of Monz&apos; pages<br/>- use your tool (or a text editor) to craft the HTML<br/>- add any graphics you&apos;d like on the page<br/>- include links or audio if necessary<br/>- zip it all up and submit it to Joe.</p><p>Then he can look at it, make any tweaks, and upload. You get the additions you want, he gets something resembling a life. You learn a valuable new skill in this age, Joe gets to spend some time composing. Someday maybe he&apos;ll implement the frames version I sent him... :)</p><p>Attaboys from a fellow webmonkey,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=40108 href="#40108">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2002 7:44:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39962.html#40095">/tuning/topicId_39962.html#40095</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; to all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: &lt;tuning@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, October 24, 2002 9:11 PM<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: mclaren issues<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_39962.html#40082">/tuning/topicId_39962.html#40082</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Paul/<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Joe, if you have a problem with monz&apos; notation, make your own<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; website!

It doesn&apos;t mean he can&apos;t<br/>include<br/>&gt; &gt; his *own* version as well...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; honestly, guys, i appreciate all the suggestions you make for<br/>&gt; improvements and additions to the Sonic Arts website.  but jeez,<br/>&gt; the only money i make off this site is the occasional purchase<br/>&gt; of my book, and for the amount of time, effort, and work that<br/>&gt; i put into these webpages, that ain&apos;t much.  so without any<br/>&gt; other means of income, i have to work too, like most people.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if you all really want me to devote my time to my tuning work<br/>&gt; that badly, then please create some kind of fund so that i<br/>&gt; can get paid to do it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i could set up the website in such a way that viewers would<br/>&gt; have to pay to get more than samples of my work, and that might<br/>&gt; eventually happen, especially if Jonathan takes a greater<br/>&gt; interest in it again as he seems to want to do, because he<br/>&gt; has a lot of music (of his own, his father&apos;s, and of various<br/>&gt; Sonic Arts improv sessions) that he&apos;s interested in selling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but in the meantime, it&apos;s all a labor of love, and as it is<br/>&gt; i&apos;m ruining my health by spending time working on webpages<br/>&gt; when i should be sleeping.  please be patient.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>***Sorry, Monz...</p><p>No problem.
