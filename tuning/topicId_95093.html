They&apos;re<br/>awful, technically, of course -- off-rhythm and out of tune -- but I<br/>really love to hear the budding musicians starting to learn what music<br/>is all about.</p><p>This year, I heard things differently. Of course the harmonies were<br/>off a little bit -- the piano&apos;s thirds are sharp by 14 cents! The kids<br/>are harmonizing with a combination of the 12TET major third (to match<br/>the piano), a just major third (tuned by ear), and a<br/>not-totally-explicable neutral third. It&apos;s all good harmony, just a<br/>little more densely packed chords than usual!</p><p>Okay, maybe that&apos;s not quite right. But I was more amused this<br/>Christmas season by the &quot;out of tune&quot; aspects of the music than I have<br/>been in years past. There&apos;s a lot said here that I don&apos;t fully<br/>understand, but what I *do* understand has been enriching.</p><p>Merry Christmas, if that&apos;s your persuasion, and thanks for an<br/>interesting bunch of conversations.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=95095 href="#95095">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2010 10:20:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake&gt;&quot;The kids are harmonizing with a combination of the 12TET major third (to<br/>match<br/>the piano), a just major third (tuned by ear), and a not-totally-explicable<br/>neutral third.&quot;</p><p>Neutral third as in...11/9?!<br/>    Funny thing is (if that&apos;s the case)...I have long believed 11/9 represents<br/>an additional low-entropy/low-tension point that I&apos;ve long suspected is<br/>physiological even though I&apos;ve yet to see any papers point to it as such.   It<br/>(11/9) is not so low-tension as the major third (obviously), but the most<br/>relaxed/&quot;consonant&quot; sounding thing between a major third and a minor third and<br/>just about the only thing between those far enough from both 5/4 and 6/5 (as a<br/>&quot;mediant&quot; of sorts) to really have its own unique mood IMVHO.</p><p>   So I think it&apos;s perfectly natural to gravitate toward the 11/9 purely by ear,<br/>especially if their minds are telling them to go for a different mood, but still<br/>fairly strong sense of wholeness/low-tension (kind of like the blue notes in<br/>blues).  Come to think of it...I believe 15/11, 18/11, 22/15, and 11/6 have<br/>similar properties (have your students ever ended up using any of those?).</p><p>   The use of both the just major third and 12TET third seems to imply they are<br/>&quot;tempering&quot; to try to get the best dyadic accuracy both relative to the<br/>piano/notes-already-playing and the idea &quot;just form&quot;...this sounds not unlike<br/>what adaptive JI does.  Interesting stuff...</p></div><h3><a id=95097 href="#95097">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2010 10:30:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/> It<br/>&gt; (11/9) is not so low-tension as the major third (obviously), but the most<br/>&gt; relaxed/&quot;consonant&quot; sounding thing between a major third and a minor third and<br/>&gt; just about the only thing between those far enough from both 5/4 and 6/5 (as a<br/>&gt; &quot;mediant&quot; of sorts) to really have its own unique mood IMVHO.</p><p>It&apos;s the mediant; there&apos;s no &quot;of sorts&quot; about it.</p></div><h3><a id=95103 href="#95103">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2010 7:49:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(concerning 11/9)</p><p>Gene&gt;&quot;It&apos;s the mediant; there&apos;s no &quot;of sorts&quot; about it.&quot;<br/>   That makes it easy enough: IE 11/9 is the mediant of/between 6/5 (minor<br/>third) and 5/4 (major third). :-) From my experience here I&apos;ve found even when<br/>I&apos;m sure of something and have researched it a lot, some expert here will still<br/>just about always find an error and accuse me of egotism (hence my very lax tone<br/>of voice here)...but hey, it&apos;s nice to not have that happen for once. :-)</p></div>
