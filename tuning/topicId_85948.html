Somehow, this wash gets<br/>separated into different &quot;sources,&quot; harmonic spectra consolidated into<br/>single timbres, etc.</p><p>The different sources that the brain picks out of this wash are often<br/>not 100% discrete, but tend to blend into each other. For example, if<br/>you play a perfect fifth, not only are you aware of the individual<br/>notes as consolidated spectra or individual &quot;sources&quot; themselves, but<br/>you are also aware of them as a fragment of the harmonic series<br/>originating from an octave below the root. You can also hear the<br/>entire fifth as one whole &quot;note,&quot; if you give it enough elbow grease.</p><p>Here&apos;s another example that everyone is familiar with: the 5-limit<br/>minor chord. This chord simultaneously contains sonorities of a 3/2<br/>interval over the root, a 5/4 over the minor third, and a 6/5 over the<br/>root - as well as a single 10:12:15 chunk of the harmonic series. This<br/>means that the possible modalities existing in this chord involve a<br/>fundamental an octave below the root, two octaves below the minor<br/>third, three octaves below the minor sixth, and four octaves below the<br/>sixth, respectively. Clearly this isn&apos;t a &quot;multistable&quot; perception<br/>like the neutral third that can flip back and forth between being 6/5<br/>and 5/4 - all of these modalities, I believe are present<br/>simultaneously to some extent, although which one is &quot;dominant&quot;<br/>becomes a matter of musical context (and inversion).</p><p>However, why doesn&apos;t this apply to single dyads that are maximally<br/>&quot;out of tune&quot;? Take, for instance, again, the neutral third: you can<br/>easily flip your perception of this interval back and forth between it<br/>being a &quot;very flat 5/4&quot; or a &quot;very sharp 6/5.&quot; But why can&apos;t the brain<br/>simply hear it as two sources at the same time - a very flat 5/4 AND a<br/>very flat 6/5? Why can&apos;t the brain simply assign two harmonic spectra<br/>to the same dyad?</p><p>We can hear the fifth in a 4:5:6 triad as its own 3:2 AND<br/>simultaneously hear it as a 4:6 (with the fundamental an octave lower)<br/>because of the 5-- why we can&apos;t easily do the same thing with just a<br/>3:2 by itself?</p><p>I&apos;m trying to piece this &quot;theory of multiple consonances of chords&quot; I<br/>have together, but this one has me stumped. Do any of you auditory<br/>scene analysis guys have the insight here?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Kalle &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/1/2010 7:28:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, why doesn&apos;t this apply to single dyads that are maximally<br/>&gt; &quot;out of tune&quot;?
