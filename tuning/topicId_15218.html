I have been overwhelmed<br/>and encouraged by the outpouring of support I have received from<br/>people around the world.</p><p>In order to provide as much information as possible on this<br/>matter, an FAQ page about the case has been posted to<br/><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/docs/faq.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/docs/faq.html</a>, and links to the<br/>full text of all relevant legal documents have been placed at<br/><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/docs/legal.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/docs/legal.html</a>.</p><p>If you have contacted CRC Press about the lawsuit, you have<br/>probably been directed to the recent court ruling granting a<br/>preliminary injunction to shut down MathWorld.  Please note that<br/>a more complete picture of the circumstances leading to the<br/>current state of affairs can be found at<br/><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/docs/legal.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/docs/legal.html</a>, which includes the<br/>original complaints and affidavits filed by CRC, together with<br/>the responses filed by Wolfram Research and me, all of which are<br/>a matter of public record in the Federal courts of Florida and<br/>Illinois.</p><p>I encourage you to read both sides of the story, and thank you<br/>again for your support during these distressing developments.</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Eric Weisstein</p></div>
